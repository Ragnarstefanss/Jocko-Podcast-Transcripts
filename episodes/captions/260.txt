[00:00:00] This is jockel podcast number 260 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening. I go good evening
[00:00:09] So
[00:00:11] I was in my
[00:00:14] bedroom
[00:00:18] Sitting on my bed and I was
[00:00:23] Renching in pain
[00:00:25] or I guess the proper word is anguish it had been two days
[00:00:35] Since Seth died
[00:00:41] And the the five stages of grief were not kind to me
[00:00:45] The first stage of grief denial was over in about 15 seconds
[00:00:58] I've had so many friends die that
[00:01:04] I know without question what it means
[00:01:10] I know how quickly it comes
[00:01:12] And I know that my friends in our line of work including Seth
[00:01:22] We dance with death all the time
[00:01:29] And just a day prior one of my friends and mentors in the seal teams master chief Mike faculty had died
[00:01:36] And all this was taking place right on the 11th anniversary of Mikey Montsoura being killed in action in Ramadi on September 29th
[00:01:47] 2006. So denial didn't last long
[00:01:51] and
[00:01:55] Neither did the the so called bargaining stage
[00:01:59] because I know there's no
[00:02:06] There's no bargaining with death
[00:02:12] I know what it is. I know it is irreversible irrevocable and I know it's 100% final
[00:02:19] which
[00:02:27] brought me to the next two stages
[00:02:31] which
[00:02:34] hit me at the same time part
[00:02:39] Working together in unison to torment me
[00:02:43] anger and depression
[00:02:50] So that's what I'm feeling sitting there in agony and the walls are closing in and the darkness is taking over my brain and I can actually see it happening
[00:03:00] I was talking about being detached so I'm I'm detached and I can see it happening and doesn't feel like there's anything I could do about it
[00:03:14] I see
[00:03:14] I see hope and I see the the fun and the joy and the laughter and I see life circling the drain
[00:03:30] and I know it's bad and I know
[00:03:34] I know where that leads
[00:03:36] I know that that's the beginning of the downward spiral
[00:03:46] Then I can feel my mind getting sucked into that vortex
[00:03:57] and I don't know what to do
[00:03:59] and from my bed
[00:04:07] you can see through the door to my office and I look into my office
[00:04:13] and I see a book and it's a book that I actually wrote
[00:04:17] the book that hadn't even been released yet
[00:04:20] it was about to be released
[00:04:22] but I had received my
[00:04:27] box of copies from the publisher and there was a stack of those books sitting on my desk
[00:04:40] and I
[00:04:42] I remembered
[00:04:44] that's like my own book was talking to me because I remembered
[00:04:47] that I had written about death in that book and when I had written about death
[00:04:55] I had written it for other people
[00:04:59] because I experienced a lot of loss, lost a lot of friends
[00:05:05] so I was writing about death so other people could learn from me because I felt like I was good
[00:05:11] and I knew how to handle death
[00:05:20] except at that moment in time I wasn't handling it too well at all
[00:05:31] so I picked up the book
[00:05:35] I picked up the book that I had written
[00:05:41] I picked up the book and opened it to a section
[00:05:47] to read the words that I had written myself
[00:05:55] and I read it
[00:05:55] the section is called death
[00:06:07] and it says how does good apply to the worst of losses the death of a loved one
[00:06:15] it's easy to think that there's nothing good in death
[00:06:18] but then I remember that people I have lost throughout my life
[00:06:26] the memories of them, the experiences, the fun, their unique personalities and everything they gave me
[00:06:35] not only in their life but in their death
[00:06:41] what their life taught me and what their death taught me
[00:06:45] the mark they had left on me
[00:06:53] and I realized there is good
[00:06:57] even in death there is good first of all I was lucky enough to have had that person in my life
[00:07:04] even if it was only for a short time
[00:07:06] two short of time at least I got that
[00:07:08] those moments, those precious moments, those unforgettable memories
[00:07:16] at least I got those and got to experience those times
[00:07:20] to know the beauty of their personality, their attitude, their outlook on the world
[00:07:24] they were all unique and I am thankful for the opportunity I had to interact with them
[00:07:38] now comes death, death is horrible and death is wretched and death is cruel
[00:07:46] and death isn't fair
[00:07:47] and I don't know why the best people seem to be taken from us first
[00:07:57] death is also inescapable
[00:08:02] there is no way out no one gets out alive
[00:08:06] death is part of life like the contrast between the darkness and the light
[00:08:21] without death there is no life
[00:08:25] and the people that I have lost they taught me that
[00:08:38] they taught me how precious life is, how blessed we are to have every day to learn, to grow, to laugh, to live
[00:08:46] to live, to live every day with purpose and passion to wake up in the morning and be thankful
[00:09:01] thankful for that morning, thankful for that opportunity to go into the world and live
[00:09:08] live for them, for those that don't have the opportunity, for those who are stolen away by death's cruel hand
[00:09:20] for them I will live, I will revere their memory and I will live
[00:09:34] live
[00:09:44] let us cry no more let us mourn no more let us remember
[00:09:51] but let us not dwell
[00:09:52] instead let us laugh and love and let us embrace and venerate everything that life is and every
[00:10:07] opportunity it gives us let us live for those who live no more
[00:10:17] let us live 200 them
[00:10:24] and that is what I tried to do then that is what I am still trying to do
[00:10:47] but I needed that bit of guidance from myself
[00:11:03] and there is even more backstory here because the book was supposed to come out
[00:11:10] October 17th 2017 that is when the book was being released and for that release of the book
[00:11:20] I had nine days of media scheduled in New York City with all the cable news networks and
[00:11:26] the syndicated radio interviews and the articles and the podcast interviews and all the stuff was set up
[00:11:31] and scheduled so people would hear about the book and of course all this stuff is what the
[00:11:41] publisher and the public sets up because they're trying to sell the book and it's the big chance
[00:11:45] to get on the New York Times bestseller list and the Wall Street Journal bestseller list and the USA
[00:11:51] today list and the Amazon list and all that and of course I know that because of the situation none
[00:11:56] of this is going to happen I know that I have to take care of my friend I have to see him off
[00:12:04] and I didn't take care of his mom and his dad and his brother and his sister so the entire nine
[00:12:13] days of media got completely canceled I did zero
[00:12:17] didn't even do my own podcast about this book in fact that's the only week where this podcast
[00:12:29] did not come out and I went to three memorial services for Seth and to his burial at
[00:12:42] Fort Rose Crans National Cemetery there was a memorial service in San Diego for the teams
[00:12:50] there was one in Houston his hometown for his Texas friends and family and there was one in
[00:12:57] Hawaii which was the location of the unit that he was attached to when he died
[00:13:02] and I had the honor of escorting his mom throughout all these events as he Seth had requested
[00:13:20] in a letter he had sent in case he died
[00:13:22] and we saw him off as best we could
[00:13:36] including going surfing and including setting something on fire at dusk which he had also requested
[00:13:48] in that letter and we burned what was left of an old surfboard that Seth had given to my
[00:13:53] son which my son had broken and we also burned an old guitar of mine that could not be tuned
[00:14:05] at least no one could tune it except for Seth somehow he could tune up a no one else could so
[00:14:09] it was of no use anymore so we set them aflame in a giant bonfire on the beach near our favorite
[00:14:16] surf spot and we push the burning surfboard out to see Viking style
[00:14:32] and we say goodbye
[00:14:33] but we will remember
[00:14:41] now what made me think about all this is that the other day I got asked a question someone asked me
[00:15:03] what your favorite mantra
[00:15:04] and of course when I when I think of mantras
[00:15:12] I think of the generic and I guess cheesy is the word for lack of a better word
[00:15:21] mantras that you hear that if you can believe it you can achieve it or
[00:15:26] or you know failure is part of the road to success or whatever whatever those things are
[00:15:31] the standard kind of mantras nothing against them but they're not really
[00:15:38] they're not really my things so this person asked me what's my favorite mantra and I say you
[00:15:41] know I'm not I'm not really into the whole mantra thing I don't really say anything to myself I just
[00:15:44] I just do what I do and this was on a call and and Jamie who is the operations director
[00:15:52] Deschalant front and she's also an instructor and she was on the call as well and she kind of
[00:15:55] chimed in to tighten me up with my answer she said she said jacco she said everything you say
[00:16:07] is a mantra you speak in mantras maybe not to yourself but the rest of us you speak in mantras and I
[00:16:13] thought about that for about a quarter of a second and I realize that she was absolutely right
[00:16:18] discipline equals freedom yes that's a mantra and I absolutely live by that
[00:16:28] good that's a mantra stay on the path that's a mantra
[00:16:35] and not only do I say these things but I actually wrote a book filled with these mantras
[00:16:39] and the title of the book is actually the mantra itself discipline equals freedom
[00:16:49] then not only that but I realized that even though I'm saying oh you don't need a mantra I need them
[00:17:01] at least sometimes
[00:17:02] sometimes like I had when it's said I needed to hear or I needed to read my own words
[00:17:15] to get me through to figure out where to go to figure out what to do
[00:17:20] well the rest of the cool part of the back stories that when the book came out it came out with no
[00:17:34] media at all it still made all those lists because you all supported it but I never covered it on the podcast
[00:17:41] and I never explained what it actually is what the book is where it came from and I just
[00:17:51] released a new version of it so I forget I better tell you and what the book is it's like an operating
[00:17:59] system well yes it's like my operating system and I originally wrote it I originally wrote it
[00:18:07] because people were asking me the same questions all the time about the same subject about jiu-jitsu
[00:18:14] and about diet and about workouts and how to overcome obstacles or how to handle defeat or failure
[00:18:20] or whatever all the same questions so I said you know what I'm just going to my original plan was and I
[00:18:25] said it on the podcast and I still get I still get messages about this what I said on the podcast
[00:18:30] is that look you all are asking me a bunch of these questions I'm just going to publish a quick
[00:18:33] ebook I'll get it together in a few weeks and get it out there and so I actually told my publisher
[00:18:38] hey I'm going to publish a little ebook about this stuff in my publisher said no no please don't do that
[00:18:43] do not publish an ebook please said you just you just were the number one New York times best
[00:18:48] selling author you don't publish an ebook well what I told them was well sorry but I'm going to
[00:18:56] I'm going to just do this as an ebook because I don't want you to tell me what has to be in there
[00:19:02] how long it has to be or what it needs to look like or any of that stuff I want to do whatever
[00:19:07] I want to do and the only way I can do whatever I want to do is if I just do it myself
[00:19:13] and I was looking into how we're going to get this thing printed so I had a vision in my mind
[00:19:17] I knew what I wanted the book to to be and my publisher to his credit and maybe to his own
[00:19:25] possible mistake said I will publish whatever you want and I said really
[00:19:31] and he said whatever you want so that's what this book is it's not a normal book if you haven't seen it
[00:19:40] before it's not a normal book the way it's written the the format of it the way it's laid out the
[00:19:48] I guess what is it the color of the pages it's just a different it's a whole different scenario
[00:19:56] of a book and well I guess if we want to learn a little bit about the book there is a visual
[00:20:05] impact to the book echo channels is there yes there is it's a really hard to print
[00:20:13] you know because instead of being white pages with like simple black letters there's all these
[00:20:17] images in the background of every single page most of the images are black and then the writing
[00:20:23] is almost all in white so it's a different book has a different visual impact it's cool some people
[00:20:31] send me pictures of they'll just have this book sitting somewhere it's sort you know just kind of
[00:20:36] have it in its position so so let's go to the book I'll I'll read through some of the stuff
[00:20:44] the the opening section is called the way of discipline people look for the shortcut the hack
[00:20:52] and if you came here looking for that you won't find it the shortcut is a lie the hack doesn't
[00:20:58] get you there and if you want to take the easy road it won't take you where you want to be
[00:21:03] stronger smarter faster healthier better free
[00:21:10] to reach goals and overcome obstacles and be the best version of you possible will not happen by itself
[00:21:16] it will not happen cutting corners taking shortcuts or looking for the easy way there is no easy way
[00:21:26] there is only hard work late nights early mornings practice rehearsal repetition study sweat
[00:21:33] blood toil frustration and discipline discipline there must be discipline discipline the route of all
[00:21:45] good qualities the driver of daily execution the core principle that overcomes laziness and
[00:21:52] lethargy and excuses discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say not today not now I need a
[00:22:03] rest I will do tomorrow what's the hack how do you become stronger smarter faster healthier how
[00:22:11] do you become better how do you achieve true freedom there is only one way the way of discipline
[00:22:22] so that's the opening of the book you know this is not there's not a this is not a verbose book
[00:22:30] you don't get paid by the word like the old newspaper writers you should get paid by the word
[00:22:37] not getting paid by the word trying to say what I'm trying to say that's it so so that that is from the
[00:22:45] first section of this book and the first section of this book is called thoughts and then the second section
[00:22:52] is called actions and the action sections includes three parts one is fuel one is
[00:22:59] one is repair and maintenance and one is the workouts so let me give you some more of these thoughts
[00:23:09] this one's called overcoming procrastination when and where to start people want to know how to
[00:23:21] stop laziness they want to know how to stop procrastination they have an idea in their head maybe
[00:23:27] even a vision but they don't know where to start so they ask and they say where do I start when
[00:23:33] is the best time to start and I have a simple answer here and now that's it you want to improve
[00:23:43] you want to get better you want to get on a workout program or a clean diet or start a new
[00:23:47] business you want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or an app
[00:23:52] where do you start you start right here when do you start you start right now you initiate action you go
[00:24:02] here is the reality the idea isn't going to execute itself that book isn't going to write
[00:24:09] itself those weights out in the gym they aren't going to move themselves you have to do it
[00:24:15] and you have to do it now so stop thinking about it stop dreaming about it stop researching
[00:24:21] every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it start doing it
[00:24:29] take that first step and make it happen get after it here and now you've been kind of getting
[00:24:37] after it lately haven't you? you made a goal you were telling me you have goals is this lens of
[00:24:44] is this kind of a new I think it's it was a progressive kind of thing it started with kind of certain
[00:24:52] things you know remember I told you I got a not a journal but what do you call like a planner?
[00:24:59] yeah you got the day planner and I've tried the planner thing many times but not like the one that you
[00:25:06] actually write in with a pencil okay you know the kind like online I got my digital my phone you know
[00:25:13] yeah it's a weird thing there's a weird thing that happens when you go physical I right yes for me
[00:25:18] that was the case for sure I could some people that's how like if you go did they got their cool app
[00:25:23] organizer app whatever and it works apparently you know a lot of people use it so you know you can't
[00:25:28] try to kind of can't refute that yeah but it didn't work for me like it didn't stick at all many many times you know
[00:25:35] I even did on the computer where I was like oh I'm gonna and I'm leaving on the desktop so I can
[00:25:39] all we see it and we'll still like it worked for certain things but not for like not for like making
[00:25:45] a bunch of videos for this but it was stuff that I would always have to revisit mentally you know
[00:25:52] and I'd be like okay it's open okay there it is there but no yeah now for clients I got a planner
[00:25:56] and a pencil a special pencil for the planner oh mechanical pencil yeah I'm a big mechanical pencil
[00:26:02] guy yeah because you can write you can write super small you need to like man yeah it's good
[00:26:07] and then you can erase it anyway so it started with that like months ago almost here really
[00:26:12] and that helped because it's interesting as I read this book you know right now and as I was
[00:26:17] reviewing it I was thinking about you because you've been kind of like almost involuntarily put on the
[00:26:24] path I guess it's like I mean you just been overexposed I mean just there's no way for you to kind of
[00:26:30] not I mean you're sitting here for hundreds and hundreds of hours yeah so your life has transformed
[00:26:37] in many ways yeah big time it's funny okay here's a quick story not de-gate too much but I'm kind
[00:26:42] of so my daughter she's the kind like she likes certain things and then certain things she just
[00:26:48] straight up doesn't like so you make her start running laps hard so like that kind of stuff so
[00:26:54] we took her you know it was it was my nephew slash son we you took him to a running
[00:27:02] coach and yeah and this coach has a group of kids all bearing levels all the way up until like
[00:27:09] guys getting full ride scholarships to like Oregon for lacrosse like the like high level
[00:27:15] athlete that's a good runner who the coach no who oh Jason yeah we don't know that's the
[00:27:22] thing we don't know so we you know and he had some friends in there and stuff like that so
[00:27:26] they were like hey come and see this coach and all this stuff former marine by the way older guy
[00:27:31] and uh and there's a bunch of kids there and they're all doing their things so I'm like yeah let's
[00:27:36] through my daughter and there too she's seven but young kid you know and there were a couple
[00:27:41] of other young boys in there eight is you know and I'm like she's not kind of like this if this
[00:27:45] is hard conditioning like track practice which it was by the way um it's it's she's not gonna
[00:27:52] like this stuff she's gonna be whatever and she did start crying at one point but she did everything
[00:27:56] that's the thing okay so the point is how I wound up on the path even though I got a mid
[00:28:01] like I've always wanted to like improve but let's face it I go with the wave man and sometimes
[00:28:07] beneficial something and a lot of times not for sure but I watched her and she was nervous she's not
[00:28:13] used to this kind like intensity you know and this guy is the coach he's really cool man he's he's
[00:28:21] but he's not mellow he's making jokes he's putting you down all jokes he can totally tell but
[00:28:26] you know she didn't know what to make of that and so but meanwhile all the kids are listening so
[00:28:33] he's like oh right now you know this kind of and the kids are just going so she has kind of no
[00:28:36] choice but to follow the wave you know if it was me and her by herself at any given moment should be like
[00:28:43] wait I don't want to do that I want to do that but when everyone else is doing it her whole
[00:28:47] at that moment environment is just react or moving but you get caught up in that wave it's kind of
[00:28:54] interesting because you you use the same metaphor for both for two opposite things you said you
[00:29:01] well you know I want to get better but you know sometimes it's kind of go with the wave right exactly
[00:29:06] and now the sudden you're saying that in this situation depending on the direction of the wave
[00:29:10] the wave is going in a good direction you kind of get caught that's what I feel like you you know
[00:29:15] you hanging out with me for the last five years by the way of just the podcast because we've been
[00:29:20] hanging out for a lot longer than that and look let's face it you had a lot of elements of
[00:29:26] of discipline and hard work I mean you you you played football obviously you got a hard work
[00:29:30] do that you know you you're awesome at jujitsu you're you know you you obviously work out hard
[00:29:37] so you have like some aspects in your life that were real kind of strong some other aspects
[00:29:41] your life we had some areas we could have improved we had a little bit more on the path they
[00:29:48] wouldn't they want to kind of write a different wave yes so yeah it's cool yeah that that wave is
[00:29:54] powerful like you know they say and there's a bunch of cool quote unquote cool tag lines where it's like
[00:29:59] oh you you're network is your net worth and like all this and basically they're awesome that's
[00:30:03] see that's what somebody asked me like what's your favorite mantra I started thinking of all those
[00:30:06] things and I was like oh you know what I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get here and Jamie was like
[00:30:11] she typed me up she's like hey jocke what everything you say is a fontra on my she's like
[00:30:15] you might not you might not think it but we all think it's true and all sorts of the truth and
[00:30:20] and those monsters even the quote unquote cheesy ones they all root the root of all of them are
[00:30:25] legitimate yeah they're not untrue yeah and some of them are absolutely like yes 100% yeah
[00:30:31] and these network is your net work and like show me your five friends I'll show you the
[00:30:37] future or whatever like all that they're all saying the same thing it's kind of like your
[00:30:41] environment is this big wave that's gonna influence you and you're gonna be writing that thing
[00:30:45] and you can fight against it you can write away that you can do whatever you want to do but
[00:30:48] rather that's a wave you might want to pick the right wave but if you pick the right wave you're good
[00:30:53] but me in this case I kind of a way didn't really pick any wave at all I'm essentially
[00:30:58] wrote one wave right into another wave and luckily that wave was going in the right direction and it
[00:31:03] was huge it is huge so yeah and I was down for it so yeah man I'm writing it and you know trying
[00:31:08] to do the right things for sure and yes very very beneficial check this next section
[00:31:17] I'm gonna jump through a bunch of these real quick but this one's called the person you can control
[00:31:23] people are not who you want them to be kill your idols sure there are things we can learn from
[00:31:29] people but people aren't going to be what you think they are what they should be
[00:31:34] people even those people you have put on a pedestal are going to be falted week
[00:31:40] ego maniacal condescending they are going to be lazy entitled short-sighted
[00:31:46] they will be they will not be perfect far from it that's fine
[00:31:51] learn from their weaknesses of course learn from their strengths and mimic and copy them
[00:31:57] and what they do well but equally as important learn from their faults see what not to do
[00:32:05] because you can't control other people you can't make them what you want them to be you can't make
[00:32:11] them who you want them to be the only person you can control is you so focus on making yourself
[00:32:20] who you want to be faster stronger smarter more humble less ego discipline your body free your mind
[00:32:28] get up early and go get after it and you'll become the person you want to be and you become
[00:32:34] that person through one small decision at a time
[00:32:41] yeah as you can see this is a book of mantras
[00:32:44] yes and then but it's not all that it's also there's also some you know there's actually a
[00:32:52] bunch of pragmatic information here's one section like that stress first of all and I don't
[00:32:59] mean to minimize the stress people face but imagine what Eugene's sled went through on
[00:33:05] Pelaloo and the tens of thousands of marines there who suffered unimaginable horror
[00:33:11] imagine what David Hacworth imagine David Hacworth assaulting enemy positions in Korea wounded
[00:33:16] over and over again on the line still going back for more imagine a poet warrior
[00:33:21] Alan Seeger and World War I getting ready to go over the top and make his rendezvous with death
[00:33:28] imagine the thousands of warriors who have gone before you who have stood and faced evil and death
[00:33:34] and now imagine you I used to do this myself while in Iraq facing stress yes we took casualties
[00:33:43] and yes it was awful and heartbreaking and every bit is wretched as I could imagine
[00:33:47] but warriors have faced much much worse the battle of the Psalm or getty's bird or the battle
[00:33:54] of the bulge or the chosen reservoir Hugh humans can withstand almost inconceivable stress
[00:34:00] and you can too so that is your first step gain perspective and to do that you must do something
[00:34:10] critical in many situations detach whatever problems or stress you are experiencing detach from them
[00:34:18] stresses generally caused by what you can't control the worst thing about incoming artillery fire
[00:34:25] is you can't control it it is happening and you just have to accept it don't stress about things
[00:34:30] you can't control if the stress is something that you can control and you are not that is a lack of
[00:34:39] discipline and a lack of ownership get control of it impose your will to make it happen solve the
[00:34:44] problem relieve the stress if the stress is something you can't control in brace it you can't control
[00:34:54] it but how can you look at it from a different angle how can you use it to your advantage I
[00:34:58] couldn't control the chaos of combat I had to embrace it I had to figure out a way to take advantage of it
[00:35:04] make it into your ally so don't fight stress embrace it turn it on itself use it to make yourself
[00:35:11] sharper and more alert use it to make you think and learn and get better and smarter and more effective
[00:35:18] use the stress to make you better this is one this is one that you know I I kind of have to go over this
[00:35:31] one and it's it's again there's a bunch of these and they're all very short like this or
[00:35:37] within these types of lengths it's kind of thing you can read for three minutes before you start your
[00:35:42] day before you work out before you go to bed at night maybe that might not be the best idea
[00:35:50] because if you treat you know you might start getting the ideas in your head and I have a real problem
[00:35:54] with that like I have ideas in my head if I have ideas in my head do you have your do you ever can't sleep
[00:36:00] is that ever happening why you got it I just wonder is that a thing it doesn't seem like you be
[00:36:08] like common at me with like a little trouble sleeping right it seems like you fully embrace sleeping like I might
[00:36:13] embrace stress yes yeah dance your way yeah I'm in before that reason for sure so you get a cool idea
[00:36:23] you can't wait like I can't wait to see a cool idea the thing that's kind of cool about you though is
[00:36:28] if you get a good idea at midnight you can just get up and start working on it and sleep until 10
[00:36:33] yes no fact me I got you like you have I think you don't have any schedule really of any kind
[00:36:45] not as far as regular schedule stuff no so other people have things that they have to do in my
[00:36:53] fun to do it yeah yeah so so this one this is not the kind of things that you want to read like
[00:37:07] right before you go to bed maybe because for me what happens it's the weirdest thing it's
[00:37:12] I've never done a psychedelic drug before but it kind of feels like a psychedelic drug where
[00:37:18] my mind is going down paths like I'm thinking about something and I can feel it like you know
[00:37:24] when I like a special of like an old school special effect when you go through some like space
[00:37:28] tunnel like a place time tunnel or something or something like a normal thing so I'll be doing that
[00:37:34] and then all of a sudden it'll go like a roller coaster off to a side and go down all
[00:37:41] I'll go down some other what you call it what I go down some other wormhole of thought but then
[00:37:45] it just branches off and it just keeps going so my it's like I'm going to a thousand miles an hour
[00:37:50] inside my own head then you there's no way I can sleep yeah I can see how that could be yeah
[00:37:56] it's it's a bummer so I would say use a little caution if you're going to read them before you
[00:38:00] go to bed I would more read them in the morning I would more you know read them during the day
[00:38:06] have the books sit now have it you know like in a place where you're thinking about it
[00:38:11] and you can pick it up sometimes here's here's what here's what I called compromise
[00:38:15] when working with other people and dynamic situations and relationships and deals a person
[00:38:20] especially a leader must compromise finding the common ground between teams merging different approaches
[00:38:24] to the same problem bridging personalities with people who might not get along reaching
[00:38:29] agreements and courses of action all these require compromise and in many cases a failure to
[00:38:35] compromise is a failure to succeed so so it's important because you know a lot of times people might
[00:38:41] well the not even might a lot of times people have the impression me there's no compromise
[00:38:46] when the reality is like oh what do you want to do that sounds like a good idea let's move
[00:38:49] in that direction as a leader it's you actually have to do that a good leader does that a good
[00:38:55] leader compromise is to a lot of things right of course you're going to have principles and
[00:39:01] values that you can't compromise but those should be small we're not small they're huge but they
[00:39:06] should be a small number of things so going back to the book but those are external
[00:39:11] compromises with other people other humans that have their own personalities and ethos and issues
[00:39:18] and compromise is needed in order to unify so to work with them compromise is a must but
[00:39:24] internally it's different with myself I have to hold the line there are areas within myself
[00:39:31] where I cannot compromise I am going to work hard I am going to train hard I am going to improve
[00:39:38] myself I am going I am not going to rest on my laurels I'm going to own my mistakes and confront
[00:39:45] them I am going to face my demons I am not going to give up or give out or give in I am going to stand
[00:39:53] I am going to maintain myself discipline and on those points there will be no compromise not now
[00:40:04] not ever
[00:40:08] reading that right before I go to sleep probably not going to do it because then I probably
[00:40:12] do a burpees in the corner of the room but it's on a ton of these things
[00:40:17] you know skip through a bunch of them right now there's one that I like in here it's called
[00:40:23] binary code I know you like that because you're a computer expert
[00:40:27] it says machines make their decisions based on binary code yes or no
[00:40:38] it is not complicated are you going to work out yes or no are you going to get up yes or no
[00:40:44] are you going to get off the couch yes or no are you going to eat that donut yes or no this is not
[00:40:50] complicated and sometimes you have to put yourself into this mode binary decision making
[00:41:00] are you going to be weak or strong are you going to be healthier unhealthy are you going to improve
[00:41:05] your life are you going to make it worse are you going to sacrifice long term success for shirt short
[00:41:11] term gratification you know the right answers you know the right decisions don't over complicate
[00:41:21] binary decision making make the right decisions that's your whole dealer it's kind of it's
[00:41:30] kind of like part you know that mode there and it's more about yourself though I think like with other
[00:41:35] people that's the thing that's the thing let's so strange about this is this stuff rings so true in my
[00:41:41] head for me but like with other people as a leader interacting in relationships like this doesn't
[00:41:48] work yeah that's weird but yeah when it comes to stuff that like you're talking to me honest like
[00:41:55] like with me like even just like the look you know like a fall you know I tend to from time to time
[00:42:01] whatever go down certain over explanations and like all this stuff whatever and you're looking at
[00:42:08] me with the zero like a straight up zero almost like it's literally zero what's a zero you know
[00:42:13] you got the one and you got the zero all right you're super good you know you're assuming
[00:42:17] yeah I got it um and the value of your statement to zero I got it
[00:42:25] you literally look at every like that kind of like oh yeah and here's the thing though that's real
[00:42:29] beneficial to though and that's part of this whole way but I think anyway where you know I'm over here
[00:42:34] you know we're all in our own head from time to time if not all the time whatever and then it's good
[00:42:38] to have that little reflective like situation where I'm saying what's in my head to see how it sort
[00:42:44] of lands on the outside world and when that thing is literally like not computing it all you're like
[00:42:52] all right well I guess I can do a way with that thought you know kind of thing and then you know
[00:42:56] sometimes you'll have like a reaction is okay that's maybe viable whatever and after a while all
[00:43:01] those zeros and ones sort of kind of formulate a little little line of code you know now we can
[00:43:07] go do some things you know kind of thing and and that's kind of like the influence but it's
[00:43:11] interesting how that you put it in that book where you got to get in that mode because you can't
[00:43:16] be like that with everything you know but but sometimes you just get in that mode and you're like
[00:43:20] all right like especially with the workout I mean that's an obvious one where you're like
[00:43:24] right you're gonna work out or not and if you're like later okay so no then are you gonna work
[00:43:28] out right now because that's what the plan was or that's what you were trying to do or whatever
[00:43:33] right and then if you're like on that it's like oh it's real clear you know so yeah man if you can
[00:43:39] get in that mode when you need to either yes or no and you know that's a thing I think to to
[00:43:45] compliment what you're saying when when you take all that gray area you know this is the important
[00:43:53] thing when you take the gray area you know what the right answer is right you can make a lot of things
[00:43:58] that make it seem like there's a whole bunch of different options there but there's really only two
[00:44:02] options you're gonna work out or you're not and all the other little things that you're thinking
[00:44:06] they're they're they're just they're just they're just they're just junk right they're just junk yeah
[00:44:13] that gray area as you mentioned it's like there's so much a danger in there there's so much oil
[00:44:18] and slippery stuff in there but that lead that out there so like okay the workout right
[00:44:24] well it's a big gray area you can throw in there I'll do it later that's one right because the
[00:44:29] fact is you can do it later and get it done straight up kind of you know you got something super
[00:44:34] important like that's a possibility you know but you start throwing that that in there it's like
[00:44:39] oh man that becomes dangerous because I would say if if considering that I'm a normal person
[00:44:46] if I throw in the idea of all do it later the chance of me doing it later goes down way more
[00:44:52] if compared to if I just say hey did it am I gonna do it now or am I not gonna do it and we're
[00:44:57] gonna do it or not gonna do it so if you say if you had three choices do it now do it later
[00:45:05] don't do it the easiest pick is kind of do it later right but do it later doesn't lead the
[00:45:11] execution doesn't lead yeah it doesn't directly lead to execution what's your percentage of when you
[00:45:17] say you'll do it later what's a percentage of execution later well now we're going deeper because
[00:45:21] do it later what does that actually mean how later in an hour later let's say in a in a
[00:45:28] in a window of time that could still be considered part of this scenario yeah you see I would say
[00:45:37] a maximum so my later we got to establish that later as opposed to tomorrow yeah let's
[00:45:43] you miss it work out later is definitely I mean same day in this scenario for it work out we're
[00:45:47] definitely talking about today same day right yeah that's usually like a three four five six
[00:45:53] hour window so if I can so the percentage of me doing it later it's weird because you know maps
[00:45:57] kind of form in your mind so if I don't get it done in the morning like before noon
[00:46:02] because you want to get your lunch or what yeah you work out on an empty stomach yeah so
[00:46:08] damn you too the norm is I don't eat nothing until the work out dinner okay dinner and then
[00:46:16] late dinner that's sort it it wait did you say dinner and late dinner so two dinners yeah
[00:46:21] yeah I didn't dinner with the family shared this with me bruh yeah and then the pre go to bed dinner
[00:46:26] that's interesting but the window how the window goes and it's just a schedule that
[00:46:32] established itself in my mind is a workout during the day or during the morning if I don't do
[00:46:37] that it's a four thirty workout pretty much for thirty across the board that's cool so you put
[00:46:42] a little deadline on yourself kind of that kind of becomes binary right it's either now or it's
[00:46:47] at four thirty yeah yeah that's kind of a good good program yeah what happens at four thirty I work
[00:46:52] out so you're saying get it done later actually you do a good percentage of getting it done later
[00:46:57] yeah but that's gonna make a really good point because technically I did go binary
[00:47:01] in almost like a second level binary situation which starts to become less and less binary
[00:47:07] if it's either now or four thirty yeah so I kind of for me four thirty means a different it means
[00:47:11] twelve hours prior but thirty in the morning but yeah man but again if and I do this naturally
[00:47:21] and it's good to have these kinds like this book or whatever just sort of pointed out for you
[00:47:25] where if I don't get it if I'm not prepping the workout drinking water out there shoes on blah blah
[00:47:32] if that's not happening between four and four thirty if I get to four forty five five
[00:47:38] if it's past five it probably won't happen just because there's other things that the household
[00:47:43] kind of needs me for you know it's so cool that your mind can be so easily
[00:47:51] reset like you're like oh you got this book like if you pick this book up and you're reading it
[00:47:56] you're gonna get it done right I mean you're you're you're you it's gonna hit you
[00:48:01] it's gonna hit you you're gonna you're gonna think yourself you know what that's correct
[00:48:04] I need to go do this I need to control myself I need to make this happen I need to go and
[00:48:09] execute I need to I need to you go in a binary mode and make this happen like you have so much
[00:48:15] influence over your brain that's so good if you put your brain on the right wave because if you put it
[00:48:21] on the right wave you're gonna go place if you put it in the wrong wave we're going down down
[00:48:25] the wrong place man we're going in a bad way so you're and it's incredible that you can so easily
[00:48:33] put your well here's the difference you can put your it takes a small bit of effort you pick
[00:48:37] the book this book you read it right you're like oh I'm gonna go get some that took a small amount of effort
[00:48:45] very small amount of effort and it puts you on the right path what strange is if you don't do
[00:48:50] anything we know where it goes right it just kind of the other wave is just kind of there just
[00:48:55] always just pulling it you just drag it and you down yeah it's just constantly there yeah I mean
[00:49:00] the wave analogy is really good respawn on because like if you're in the ocean right you're going
[00:49:06] this way you're going that way you're going there everyone's while you catch a current you know go
[00:49:11] you know kind of in this direction first thing they've been a amount of time or whatever
[00:49:15] or distance and then but by if you get on one of those waves brought you're going full speed you know
[00:49:19] what you can get caught in a rip current you're going out to see like a bad way right you go down
[00:49:25] the downward spiral of horribleness ditching savagery right wrong wave yeah it's true um but I've always
[00:49:34] looked at this book as like I mean it seems like I like I feel like a ferrell manual you know how
[00:49:41] like okay it's called a field man you're like you're right so you know like if if your car has a
[00:49:47] I don't know check engine later I don't know you know whatever some issue with your car and you're
[00:49:50] not you know super well versed in like automchanics whatever and you're like hey man I've been
[00:49:55] looking to this I got a small issue with my car I got to know how to solve this issue where do you go
[00:50:00] for you know when there's manual or am I connected to whatever let's say if you need some answers
[00:50:06] you go to the manual you know that manual is for your car straight up you can go to the internet
[00:50:12] for sure but you go to the manual you're going to get the answer for your question however it's
[00:50:16] directed directly linked to your issue with your specificer this manual if you regard that as your
[00:50:22] manual for not necessarily your physical but but for how you are gonna be those answers are for you
[00:50:32] then oh yeah all day because you know it's easy to go on the internet
[00:50:38] the gram right I'm a following inspirational person you know and maybe that applies to me maybe it
[00:50:43] doesn't and then after a while it's all just sort of like yeah I heard that before cool saying
[00:50:48] let me go back to what I was doing kind of a thing and it sort of doesn't land anymore
[00:50:51] but if you regard again like this book for you like you need and you say you know just how you said
[00:50:57] it's like gonna go where you can just just pick it up and just read it you know for a minute or whatever
[00:51:01] that answer whatever you read that is for you it nit crazy though that like and that's what
[00:51:07] that's what all the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is because like that whole thing was
[00:51:12] Seth like I needed my own book I needed to go to the owner's manual yeah I needed that my
[00:51:18] so I wrote these words I contemplated them I lived through them I garnered the experience and then at
[00:51:25] the moment in time I actually needed to go to this manual and say what am I supposed to do right now
[00:51:35] yeah exactly right and that there's all kinds of you know I mean that's an extreme example
[00:51:41] but you know even as I read like the binary code thing it's like yes oh yeah how easy is it to just
[00:51:47] go and add other way over there that's kind of going to a horrible you know lame week place filled
[00:51:53] with gray excuses and justifications if you're gonna justify yourself yeah gray all day you know
[00:52:00] not black going anyway so that's that's what that's what the that's what the thoughts and there's
[00:52:05] a bunch of these more and this the the the new field manual that's the difference is I added a
[00:52:10] but a bunch more of into this thought section about mind control about weakness and about the
[00:52:15] destroyer mode and about the application of discipline about the fear of failure and about what to
[00:52:20] do and you're not feeling it and what what to do and you get overwhelmed and how to detach and
[00:52:25] how to handle the feet and just all these things that we need help with that I need help with that
[00:52:30] we as human beings need help with a bunch of stuff in there that you can pick up and that will
[00:52:37] keep you on the path but as we know thoughts only go so far right we have to take action which is the
[00:52:45] next section of the book it is called actions and and the first little section in actions is physical
[00:52:51] training subtitle getting after it yes there physical training back to the book there are all
[00:52:59] kinds of benefits from physical training you will be healthier this is a fact by working out
[00:53:03] you will increase your endorphins testosterone go form on cardiac value insulin sensitivity
[00:53:08] and natural killer cells those changes will help prevent or treat the following health issues
[00:53:14] high blood pressure obesity heart disease type 2 diabetes in Somia and depression boom
[00:53:21] still not convinced working out will make you smarter yes smarter it improves blood flow to the
[00:53:29] brain it boosts growth hormones that promote growth of new nerve cells it improves synaptic
[00:53:36] plasticity the ability for neurons to send and receive messages it releases brain chemicals
[00:53:43] that help cognition like dopamine glutamate nor an effort and serotonin it also boosts the
[00:53:51] production of brain derived neurotropic factor approaching that helps with mental processes
[00:53:57] but don't just take my word for it go do get some exercise done and pay attention to your mental
[00:54:05] state you will feel more aware sharper and smarter this is real there you go this is like oh
[00:54:14] why do you want to physically why do you want to work out it actually makes you smarter look it
[00:54:18] makes you stronger it makes you more healthy but it made I might my my my daughter all this daughter
[00:54:24] was taking a what a final exam to a final week all day she's all stressed out you know
[00:54:31] because she likes to get whatever high grades and stuff yeah that whole thing yeah and uh she was
[00:54:37] like told I go you need to go and and it just so happened when I see this out when it was reviewing
[00:54:42] for this book but I was reviewing like you know I did a bunch of research and read a bunch of stuff
[00:54:47] because look I know I feel I know I feel smarter and better when I work out but when I was writing
[00:54:53] this book I said okay what is that you know so I started asking I talked to Peter or Tier 2
[00:54:59] to go I was like hey what what is up with us and these are the kind of things these big words
[00:55:04] these big medical words that I put in there right so I told my daughter said go for like at least
[00:55:10] a 20 minute workout before this examination and she did so that's what you need that's why we're
[00:55:19] working out that's why we're working out it's so obvious that it's so good for you and even from
[00:55:24] the earliest of podcast echo trials you made this statement exercise is like the thing that you can
[00:55:30] do in your life that will positively impact the most other things in your life which is a bold statement
[00:55:36] and a true statement in my humble opinion stress the good and the bad this is this is an area
[00:55:44] where I talk about stress and look in order to improve we need stress we need to push the body
[00:55:50] and the mind in order to get better one of our main physical reactions to stress is to release
[00:55:56] the hormone cortisol into the body it has a multitude of effects including making glucose available
[00:56:02] and so I go into this what it does what stress does to you and and it's positive because it
[00:56:07] generates energy it focuses energy it focuses you on immediate threats it prepares you for immediate
[00:56:15] threats so that stuff is all good it allows you to do better in the world but you can also go
[00:56:23] overboard with it stress can be bad so I go through that too much stress and the cortisol is
[00:56:27] released too often it it it's like a car running in the red so I go into that whole thing so what we
[00:56:34] have to do is you have to stress the body and the mind in order to improve but obviously
[00:56:40] you can't overstress it so I talk through that whole thing and here's something I was like
[00:56:47] you know I'll cover this on the podcast and this section is called sleep this is for the haters
[00:56:55] can I use that word and not be a 15 year old girl oh yeah sure the haters so
[00:57:01] so obviously you know I get up early every day and get stuff done oh man you took you back down
[00:57:11] the other day what up oh yeah I chose traveling so good point so the other day I was traveling
[00:57:18] my flight was delayed or whatever and I didn't get back into SD until midnight got home at
[00:57:28] 1230 and I had spent a couple days on East Coast time so I wasn't even really like I do always
[00:57:36] entire so I probably fell asleep at like a 130 my alarm went off at 430 and I was like I
[00:57:42] didn't play this see what this feels like at 430 that 430 I wasn't yeah so I went back to sleep
[00:57:49] why because sleep is good for you and if you don't have enough sleep you don't
[00:57:54] you don't perform well you don't think well now listen here's the thing people go crazy with this
[00:58:00] right and people you should read this you should like they say if you have less than 8 hours of
[00:58:06] sleep you're like being a drunk yeah that is just factually untrue right I'm telling you I
[00:58:15] have like you've been to the muster right at some of the early musters where life and I are on stage
[00:58:21] we're answering questions we're interacting with people we're roleplaying we're going through dynamics and
[00:58:25] areas we're we're performing cognitive cognitive tasks for 8 and a half straight 8 and a half
[00:58:34] 9 10 hours straight we had one hour of sleep not kidding this some of those musters the new
[00:58:40] York muster I think we had like one hour of sleep so if we had if if before the muster I had done
[00:58:48] 16 shots of yager muster the muster would have been a lot different now some people
[00:58:55] might have liked it those people wanted their money back so look sleep so so this is people think
[00:59:03] I don't like sleep or I don't support sleep or I think you know you and it's not true and I was
[00:59:08] saying when people you think you're you're you're giving people advice that's unhealthy here's the
[00:59:13] actual advice that I give people from the book sleep is an necessity humans need sleep failure to get
[00:59:20] enough sleep has serious side effects lack of sleep can cause negative hormonal changes interfere with
[00:59:26] them metabolizing glucose of glucose increase blood pressure and suppress the immune system less sleep
[00:59:34] also means less human growth hormone in your body which means less muscle mass and weaker bones
[00:59:40] mentally the brain is impacted as the ability to pay attention and concentrate begins to diminish
[00:59:45] and problem solving and basic reasoning becomes less acute furthermore over an extended period there are
[00:59:51] psychological effects like paranoia and even hallucinations so that's me talking about sleep you need
[00:59:58] to sleep I'm not anti-sleep is there a thing called a fast sleeper yes we'll get there we'll get there so
[01:00:08] so check this out but how much sleep is enough different people need different amounts of sleep new
[01:00:14] borns can sleep up to 17 hours a day toddlers can sleep 12 hours a day as people grow older
[01:00:21] less sleep is required teens generally need 8 to 10 hours and by the time people are full of
[01:00:27] adults 8 hours becomes the standard even though the actual number is between 7 and 9 hours depending
[01:00:33] on the individual some people genetically need even less sleep than that but those people are rare
[01:00:38] I'm one of those people and this isn't I don't have the proof well here's my proof
[01:00:45] I guess I'm proof my oldest daughter is like me like last night she was studying she's
[01:00:51] went to bed at midnight I woke up at 4th of the she's up and then she took an exam cognitive not
[01:00:57] impaired right she's gonna get an A you know what I'm saying so but but my second daughter
[01:01:04] the girl likes to sleep like she'll get out of bed when you go drag her out of bed right like she likes to sleep
[01:01:09] my son kind of it kind of normal I would say my wife she digs that sleep
[01:01:15] mm so some of my kids get some of it my youngest daughter she's sort of a little bit I would
[01:01:21] see that's sleep too but but so there's so so I think there is some sort of genetic thing
[01:01:31] here's a but it's it's people also will look you that it's so rare there's no chance you
[01:01:39] have it okay cool I'm gonna I can really tell you people like people say sleep more I'm not
[01:01:46] trying to sleep less I'm more than happy to sleep you know but it just doesn't happen
[01:01:53] so going on here but it isn't only genetics you can also sleep less and fall sleep faster
[01:01:58] if you are in good physical condition eating clean and have a clear mind for me the better condition
[01:02:03] I'm in and the cleaner I eat the more quickly I will fall asleep and the less sleep I need do you
[01:02:08] notice this do you notice that you need to less sleep when you're fasting I don't notice but
[01:02:16] I'm not paying attention okay I like going I when I'm fasting I feel like I'm on fire
[01:02:22] yeah and I I just did a fast I just did a 48 hour and I feel I felt like later again like I was
[01:02:29] waking up earlier than I normally wake up so while I do have short sleep genetics on my side
[01:02:37] equally important is that I stay healthy and eat clean what about when you eat junk how don't you
[01:02:42] need to sleep more yeah but actually you know what it's really inconsistent when you junk or
[01:02:48] sorry when I eat junk it's sometimes all sleep less but be wanting to sleep more but you know
[01:02:57] the kind like you're tired and you feel sleepy but you can't like go to sleep you know it's like that
[01:03:02] there's a lot of that go in the worst I think you feel like you wish you would sleep more but you can
[01:03:08] you kind of can't just get up yeah exactly and feel like crap or whatever and sort of you know
[01:03:13] maybe catch the next wave of sleepiness I guess the and on the inverse when you're talking
[01:03:19] about like when you exercise consistent you eat clean or whatever and it's really different
[01:03:24] where and it's really real clear where you feel freaking solid during the day and then once that
[01:03:30] bedtime ish kind of rolls around you just feel the wave just crash and you're like oh it's bit
[01:03:35] sleep time so good yeah it's really good when you worked out hard you had a good day you ate clean
[01:03:42] you get to the end of that you're like boom you're out right that's how it was yesterday and like
[01:03:46] and I got like an hour less sleep than I normally did the day before so but I got up solid boom
[01:03:52] feeling good now that we're thinking about this when I have like those weird roller coaster
[01:03:58] brain rides that's usually that's usually when I'm like something's messed up you know what weather
[01:04:05] I'm eating crap or or whatever yeah bro it was the kind of like I do quizzes in story time for
[01:04:14] what the kids before bed every night is like what eight or clock eight 30 bro it was the time
[01:04:19] like it's a kind in the middle of a question that I'm asking it's straight up that's a day right there
[01:04:27] yeah it's like okay it's about that yeah I I've had that world when my kids were a little
[01:04:32] and I was telling the durs you know you're just getting up at 430 you're doing whatever you're
[01:04:38] doing at water come home you know and you're just getting bed read that story next thing you know it's
[01:04:44] free a clock at the morning for clock the morning what just happened yeah my wife left me in there
[01:04:49] because she was running around with three kids at the time you know trying to get them all square
[01:04:55] to waste you like oh you got the kid school she probably went to a bar out on the what she
[01:05:00] did that she knows that girl went to sleep she used to fall asleep with someone kid almost every night
[01:05:04] it was crazy so going on here and finally I choose not to sleep in I don't give in
[01:05:13] to the pillow I don't give into the temptation of warm blankets or soft pillow I mobilize the
[01:05:19] will to get me out of bed and get into the game obviously I'm an advocate of waking up early
[01:05:24] but since sleep must be a priority to maintain health how can we get enough sleep and still wake up early
[01:05:32] the answer is simple go to bed earlier go to bed earlier now I'm gonna skip the little bit here
[01:05:42] go forward well this I talked about some of the benefits like what are the benefit why do I
[01:05:45] wake up early and I mean first there's some simple math but why do you wake up early the world is yours
[01:05:51] when you're up before the enemy there's no traffic the gym is empty there's no one distract you
[01:05:56] or call you or send you some stupid text about something you don't care about so there's like
[01:06:01] all these benefits to to being up early but then going back to the other point falling asleep how
[01:06:08] do you fall asleep so this is kind of what we're just talking about number one and there's a whole
[01:06:12] section I'm gonna read some highlights of it number one get tired yes get tired if you are not active
[01:06:17] throughout the day you won't be tired you know it's weird as a recording the podcast depending on the podcast
[01:06:24] I'm usually super wired when we get done recording and then I'm tired you know it's a mental
[01:06:31] mental work yeah fully on number two turn off the computer turn off the smartphone stop checking
[01:06:39] social media and stop watching one more YouTube video sure there's some science it says that the
[01:06:45] light from the computer and phone screen tricks your mind and thinking is daylight and time to get
[01:06:51] up but on top of that the internet is filled with professionals that create content with the
[01:06:56] sole purpose of getting you to click on it yes clickbait is real and just like the bait used
[01:07:01] in fishing it is a trick to get you hooked so don't don't click it you will get nothing positive at
[01:07:07] all number three read if your mind is still active when you reach your bedtime that's okay
[01:07:12] get into bed and get a book and start reading reading is relaxing it settles your mind and makes you
[01:07:17] smarter so do it dude reading will reading I think reading is a massive sleep aid yeah everyone's
[01:07:26] wanting to like you not everyone's well most of them actually in my experience because I wouldn't be
[01:07:31] reading a boring book that's his first specific purpose but usually they're interesting books so
[01:07:38] at first I might be like oh kind of excited but yeah man after it depends on the day or whatever
[01:07:44] but it can be like after like 10 minutes 15 minutes I you know the kind of books I read because I
[01:07:49] read them on the podcast all the time I'm talking about books about war combat in the most dynamic
[01:07:53] heroic situations like even those books if I'm reading I'll be like oh if it's nighttime and I'm
[01:08:01] reading I'll I'll get tired of falsely yeah I mean I won't I don't falsely while I'm reading I
[01:08:05] really do that but I'll be like okay I'm tired yeah I've missed out the book and go bad oh yeah
[01:08:10] then that's exactly what I'm saying or maybe at first if it's like super interesting or exciting
[01:08:15] whatever book you're like at first you're like oh man let's get some reading going you know about this
[01:08:20] whatever you're reading about and then yeah after like I said it depends on how your state of mine is
[01:08:25] but as far as time goes but yeah after a little while you're ready you're ready to go sleep
[01:08:30] I just got done reading a book for the podcast that it was it was it was a book that I like
[01:08:36] was actively couldn't sleep because I just was like I'm gonna read this more of this because I
[01:08:39] want to know what's about the happen that's pretty crazy. Number four most important the key to
[01:08:46] getting to sleep early is getting up early. No it might not help you tonight but tomorrow night it
[01:08:52] will. If you need seven full hours of sleep and you want to get up at 430 a.m. that means you need to
[01:08:57] go to bed at 930 p.m. but it is hard to force yourself to sleep at 930 so you stay up until 1130
[01:09:06] you should still get up at 430 yes that will only be five hours of sleep and yes you will
[01:09:11] likely feel tired throughout the day which is actually good because at the end of the day you'll
[01:09:15] want to be tired now you can go to bed at 930 and get yourself back on track that's that's the
[01:09:21] part that people if you want to be tired at night at 930 you need to get up early you can't you can't
[01:09:26] get up at 9 in the morning and expect to be tired at 9 at night it won't happen and the last thing
[01:09:35] is do it every day right and this is like you know weekend this way it's just whatever to do the same
[01:09:40] time look if you want to give yourself an extra half an hour I don't even recommend that I recommend
[01:09:43] you get up at the same time every day yeah that um here's a mistake I think that well
[01:09:52] when I say some people me I make this mistake or I have made this mistake straight up where
[01:09:57] I'll be like okay yeah I'm gonna do that I want to get up early you know and earlier whatever so I'll
[01:10:02] just wake up earlier and be tired throughout the day but what I did is I didn't look at the big
[01:10:07] picture I was like all just automatically be tired at night you know but what I did was I would
[01:10:13] lays through the desk it worked out a lot of laying down on the couch you know a lot more than normal
[01:10:19] and then you know you know you basically sense your tired you kind of adjust your activity accordingly
[01:10:26] you know in a bad way so you do just way less and then nighttime comes you're not as tired as as
[01:10:31] you could have been if you just went about your normal routine sure you got power through it
[01:10:35] little bit harder for sure if you're on less sleep or whatever but at the end when it comes
[01:10:39] time to sleep which was your goal it's gonna be way more like it's gonna happen easy you know
[01:10:46] or it's gonna happen in my case they just straight up doesn't happen I'm freaking up late again
[01:10:51] can't go sleep with him yeah gotta be careful so yeah do the normal routine don't be slacking
[01:10:57] I got a little section on here on power and apps people like do you take an app yes I do
[01:11:01] if I'm super tired but I then I explain the whole thing in here elevate your feet above your heart
[01:11:06] which I learned from one of my high school teachers and then I only sleep for like eight minutes
[01:11:11] and if you really tired eight minutes seems like you just got a full on
[01:11:15] massive amount of sleep yeah remember we were talking about the two types of tired
[01:11:22] yeah yeah this sleepy tired and then there's like physical fatigue yeah kind of and then you know
[01:11:27] what kind of in the total eight minute nap thing sometimes six minutes it's almost like in this
[01:11:33] is all what do you call hypothesis and what will say that where if like if you could just go
[01:11:41] like if you just did like a marathon freaking podcasters or you know after you do a podcast you
[01:11:47] mentioned where you're kind of tired you know something that that that required like cognitive
[01:11:53] effort for a somewhat sustained amount of time you you're not exhausted physically but mentally
[01:12:01] you might have like this sharpness they usually have this just dull because like your your foot like
[01:12:07] it's almost like a superficial conscious like cognitive like a bit almost that's what it almost seems
[01:12:13] like so if I'm working on something on the computer like admin numbers or freaking stuff
[01:12:21] not editing stuff like you know work for like three hours and then it's work out time
[01:12:28] I'm gonna take one of those six minute eight minute in a couple so much yeah for sure
[01:12:33] but the thing is like six minute eight minutes what can what can possibly recover in that I don't
[01:12:38] know it's real oh yeah it's real and it's like you've ever had a dream in eight minutes oh yeah
[01:12:44] I have four on dreams and you ever have those little half dreams like okay so usually it happens it
[01:12:50] is your body moved yes but it's something very specific though where sometimes you just like
[01:12:55] feel like oh you just jump run almost like oh no for me it's because someone's talking about
[01:12:59] the lack of my head and my dreams so yeah that makes sense but yes it's that it's that though
[01:13:06] it's something specific where like like the other days I was I was getting one in and
[01:13:11] my son in my little dream it lasted literally like two seconds like a two second dream almost
[01:13:18] and my son like ran under my legs and I like I did jump over him oh my dream yeah so I
[01:13:23] jumped and I'm like that's what caused me to jump but it was I remember it was my son ran
[01:13:27] under my legs that sounds a lot more pleasant than a battle axe yeah but I'm very into the battle
[01:13:32] axe yeah my hair kill you probably a lot different than yours for sure
[01:13:35] uh next section the workouts everyone wants to know what should a workout actually consist of
[01:13:46] and first of all let me say this the most important thing is to do something anything walk
[01:13:52] jog calcenex swim lift some way to hike stretch do burpees play a game of basketball or go
[01:13:57] get on the gizzi to map some people aren't sure what to do for a workout but that is often just an excuse
[01:14:04] exercise doesn't need to be some complex multi-level multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional
[01:14:09] scientifically proven methodology but it does need to be something so go through a whole section about
[01:14:16] the workouts and then I actually put workouts in the book to see the actual workouts go to appendix
[01:14:26] the workouts again use the workouts as a guide learn about your own body push yourself most important
[01:14:32] be consistent and consistency starts with getting in the gym if you are tired or sore or
[01:14:38] burned out don't just give up completely go to the gym and stretch move do some light exercises
[01:14:43] but keep the routine in place too often people take the day off and that turns into two
[01:14:50] and two into three and then they've gone a week without getting in a good workout so
[01:14:54] maintain the routine maintain the discipline I didn't cover this section but that's I've had a lot of
[01:15:00] people like this attitude you're tired your sore you feel like you need a day off cool do it tomorrow
[01:15:09] still do the workout today do tomorrow because it's it's a way tomorrow I was in take the day off tomorrow
[01:15:13] take the day off tomorrow so you know you go to that spot you're like you know what I could
[01:15:19] probably just type you know I worked out really hard it's been it's been six days it's been three days
[01:15:24] straight I'm kind of tired I do have this you know project do I actually really
[01:15:30] take the day off today okay cool you can take the day off tomorrow still have to do it today
[01:15:35] I guess what you wake up tomorrow you don't need to take a day off it was all just negotiate
[01:15:39] yeah look but the cool thing is you maybe you do need to day off cool you wake up the next day
[01:15:43] you're like god I am so cool take the day off yeah yeah and that's the pre and I've done that before
[01:15:48] where I'm beyond I'm not that good at doing that yet but I've done that before world be like
[01:15:54] no I'm going to power through in fact I'm going to go as hard as I freaking can I'm going to go
[01:15:57] extra hard and then I'll take it tomorrow and then on times where I really did need the day off
[01:16:02] the next day I feel even worse like oh yeah yeah but other times it's most of the time
[01:16:10] most of the day it's just the day you don't feel like it you freaking whatever you did last night
[01:16:15] or whatever it's some some other factor that has to do with just the day you know you're
[01:16:19] some stances you don't so just like have some minimum work out that you must do
[01:16:24] yeah yeah yeah like oh you know what oh you're gonna be a you're you're you're you're
[01:16:31] a millimeter from not doing anything okay I'm gonna go do the minimum work out I'm gonna
[01:16:35] do this just this stuff get it done and then if I still feel like crap tomorrow I'll take a legit
[01:16:42] day off yeah and another thing that that is almost like a thing that gets revealed is that
[01:16:48] minimum workout thing has obviously a bunch of benefits but usually you know how like and again
[01:16:53] depends on what you were doing before the workout maybe what you're doing last at whatever but a
[01:16:58] lot of times once you just get the blood flowing right or once you're yeah yeah and this is the
[01:17:03] thing I don't know that the full ins and outs of it get asked of actual fitness person but like it's
[01:17:07] it's called priming priming your body and mind whatever for work out so a lot of times you're just
[01:17:12] deprimed I made that word up deep primed but you understand what I'm saying right it's the opposite
[01:17:18] of pulling priming sometimes you're just more deprimed than you normally are you know and you're
[01:17:25] just really not into it for other reasons you know so sometimes that minimum workout you're like
[01:17:29] all right and you sort it inadvertently primed your whole deal yeah I'm not so retired and over
[01:17:36] change but I noticed that a lot with with anybody part but like your legs for sure if you know when
[01:17:43] it's squat day yeah now we don't know what what unseen mechanisms are at work in your brain
[01:17:49] that are telling you that you're like more sore but a lot of times you're rolling into squat
[01:17:54] day and you're feeling in your mind you're thinking on pretty sore you're really negotiating
[01:18:00] hard for that day off and you really notice after you and even your first couple sets you know you're
[01:18:06] just do you just do some some body weight squats just to warm up and you're like oh I'm definitely
[01:18:11] sore then you do the 45 pound bar just you're just getting warmed up yeah you take the PVC pipe you
[01:18:17] do some overhead squats you're like wow I'm definitely sore and then when you start putting some
[01:18:22] some weight on you start realizing I'm actually not sore I just start feeling good and you're
[01:18:27] good to go yeah you were good to go that's what that's that happens a lot that happens a lot
[01:18:34] this seems to happen a lot on on the on the good old squat day too so when you say and this is
[01:18:39] more your personal thing like your squat day or whatever well you do just squats or legs or whatever
[01:18:45] or is it like a you know I mean I do some other stuff but yes I will be other body parts
[01:18:50] or other exercises for later no really it's just about just just squat day yeah squat day which
[01:18:55] encompasses all kinds of different leg work we'll say yeah I've done I've always done multiple
[01:19:01] body parts but usually squat day would would be just part of just a multiple body part day but
[01:19:09] when I sweat it was a hack kind of out of laziness in a way where I'd be like you know what I'm just
[01:19:14] gonna designate one day for just squats and then I started incorporating just a small muscle group
[01:19:19] like a girl's situation maybe some triceps then do the squats so if if I do like shoulders for
[01:19:26] example depends on the workout obviously but if I'm going like hardcore shoulder press then freaking
[01:19:32] super set of this and that you know a whole shoulder workout and you want me to go do squats now
[01:19:39] after the age of about 30 that started to be less and less of a sustainable thing mentally in my
[01:19:46] mind okay that's interesting so you've gotten mentally weaker if you've got as you've gotten older
[01:19:51] yes there I have apparently that's strange but you sure you just didn't get it smarter where you
[01:19:56] realized if you really wanted to push you needed to focus you needed to prioritize next cube I would
[01:20:01] say that that's a good way of putting it making it sound better or rationalizing right and maybe
[01:20:05] rationalize it or maybe that was the case the whole time you know where I could be benefiting way more
[01:20:10] from this this this leg workout if I just soloed it one day rather than doing a big other body part
[01:20:19] workout then than the legs and vice versa too because sometimes I would do the squats first
[01:20:23] and then suffer through a shoulder workout or something like this yeah but now anyway let's
[01:20:28] do like I always I always if possible lift before due to yeah right that's do you do that yeah
[01:20:36] 100% and I'll tell you it's it's not because it's not it's it's it's because
[01:20:46] Gigi to I don't want to go and work out I would rather go to Gigi to with some muscle fatigue
[01:20:53] than go to workout with muscle fatigue yeah even though isn't that that seems backwards that
[01:21:00] seemed counterintuitive I know because you think I'm going to compete against echoes or I want to be
[01:21:04] ready to go yeah it seems like the intuitive thing but I would much rather just be a little bit
[01:21:11] tired when I'm rolling with whoever then to be all then to be tired when I roll into the gym yeah well
[01:21:18] and now I think if you know the dynamics of both types of workouts I think it's obvious that you
[01:21:24] do want to lift do a lifting before Gigi to because Gigi to has quick diminishing returns with strength
[01:21:31] that's very quick yeah endurance not so much but muscle like strength or whatever it's quick but
[01:21:40] it's the opposite for lifting weights so you need your strength you don't necessarily need that
[01:21:45] much endurance depending on the workout obviously but as far as lifting weights goes you don't need
[01:21:49] that much endurance but when you go to Gigi to if you don't have that much strength but as long
[01:21:55] as you can kind of sustain and you know do this thing I mean you're not going to run like a whole
[01:21:59] crossfit games routine and then go to Gigi to and think you're going to feel good I mean it's
[01:22:04] a bit different you know but that's true although I'll tell you like I'll do some crazy workouts
[01:22:09] and so go to Gigi to barely remember that I mean and I'm not talking I go like walk from one to the
[01:22:15] other you know I work out the morning really hard and then in the afternoon I'm going to Gigi
[01:22:20] yeah but that time you go what 80-90% of your strength actually it's not that big of a deal yeah and
[01:22:24] Gigi to different like that because the your energy output in Gigi to is very variable very
[01:22:28] much so and you can modulate fully like and you know it's going to obviously depend on who you're
[01:22:33] rolling with as well you go with a tornado dude who's good it's like you're going to feel that
[01:22:37] workout in the morning if you have that kind of day but if a normal day of Gigi to where some
[01:22:42] guys you go hard sometimes you go medium sometimes you don't have to go as hard as far as that goes
[01:22:46] you can modulate and yeah navigate through the energy output easy but as far as like the type of
[01:22:52] exercise versus the other type of exercise lifting whatever if you switch them around you do
[01:22:57] Gigi to first and all that sort of sustained output and you thinking and going to go into a
[01:23:02] lifting and freaking push hard negative yeah that's a weird thing man to weird thing but that's it
[01:23:09] seems to be you know you're an agreement on that got a section in here on building a home gym
[01:23:15] and this is obviously with the world that we're in right now with COVID this is a very
[01:23:21] good thing to have a home gym and you can I go through all the all the kinds of different things
[01:23:26] that you should get first and the considerations you know get in pull up bar and and then
[01:23:32] things like you know you I don't have enough money you can get a pull up bar for $9 at home
[01:23:37] people I'm not even talking about you know you go and whatever you can get a piece of pipe you
[01:23:42] you have a pull up bar you can get a set of rings for pretty cheap like there's a there's ways that
[01:23:46] you can make it happen so I got a little section in there and building a home gym yeah the home
[01:23:51] gym thing that the I think the primary factor that you really have to kind of consider and
[01:23:56] navigate is the space yeah more so than the money because money is like for the most part
[01:24:01] you can like spend way less or just you know make payments or whatever even the space though
[01:24:08] you can see people that do really cool creative things to get good work out in a small space
[01:24:13] yeah you do and you really need very minimal equipment to be in awesome shape really the only
[01:24:21] piece of equipment that I think you actually need is a pull up bar because if you have a pull up bar
[01:24:25] you can do pull ups but you can autumn you can already do push ups did not dips but push ups
[01:24:33] you can do all kinds of chest variation push up very like you can get crazy with push ups
[01:24:37] movers millions of different varieties of push ups you can do you can do squats you can do lunches
[01:24:42] you can do you can do basically your whole body can do handstand push ups for your shoulders like
[01:24:46] there's so many things that you can do if you just have a pull up bar if you don't have a pull up
[01:24:51] bar you're kind of yeah that's true yeah like you can't just like because all those things that
[01:24:56] you said aside from the the anything pulling or whatever you you don't need anything you just
[01:25:02] get the ground you just need the ground yeah man maybe a wall or a tree or whatever almost
[01:25:07] every building has a wall yes and every yeah or a tree there's some thing outside of whatever you
[01:25:13] know but yeah the pulling thing it's hard to our to access if you don't have like a pull up bar
[01:25:18] rings are really good because then you can not only do pull ups you can also do dips and then there's
[01:25:24] all kinds of other crazy things that you can do with rings so rings are also awesome the next
[01:25:29] section is called martial arts again this is an operating this is my operating system and part of my
[01:25:35] operating system as you've just heard a time out is martial arts and I say everyone should train in
[01:25:40] martial arts just as everyone should eat but just as food is different and varies greatly in how
[01:25:46] an affects your body not all martial arts are created equal there are three broad forms of martial arts
[01:25:52] grappling striking and weapons grappling uses leverage and hold to control or submit your opponent
[01:25:59] striking you striking uses punches kicks knees elbows head butts or any other body part to hit the
[01:26:05] opponent martial arts with weapons obviously use utilize a variety of weapons including sticks knives
[01:26:11] and in the modern world firearms perhaps the most critical form of self defense is the mind
[01:26:19] by being smart and aware you can avoid situations that are likely to expose you to danger that
[01:26:25] being said there are times when you're mind and your intelligence can no longer help you
[01:26:32] that is the reality so that's why we train right because there's as much as someone says
[01:26:37] you know I I'm able to avoid to look there's gonna be situations that you can end up in even if you're
[01:26:42] completely situational aware and you're looking to avoid situations they can still happen that's
[01:26:46] why you have to train I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here because I talk about firearms
[01:26:56] and the necessity of firearms in certain situations and I say that's most important without proper
[01:27:04] training possessing a firearm as useless or even more dangerous to its owner than not having one learning
[01:27:09] how to shoot quickly and accurately while under stress is absolutely mandatory if one is going to
[01:27:14] own a firearm this means finding a good instructor at a quality range to participate in firearms training
[01:27:20] right so you you gotta have a firearm and and I'm gonna go back and read a section that I wasn't
[01:27:24] planning to read but I'm gonna read it anyways it is an eat the firearm the ultimate form of self
[01:27:35] defense is the firearm it is an equalizer without parallel and it's simply unmashing its ability
[01:27:41] to eliminate an attacker regardless of size and strength if a person truly needs self protection
[01:27:46] in a high threat area there is no substitute for the firearm even in an area that might be considered
[01:27:52] low threat there are no guarantees there have been horrific home invasions car jackings kidnappings
[01:27:57] and other vicious and violent attacks and some of the most prestigious neighborhoods in the world
[01:28:02] that were also considered to be the safest there is no choice but to be prepared
[01:28:08] so firearms talk about some of the training and what you do and you know some of the
[01:28:15] some of the benefits of it firearms training build to hand eye coordination speed, concentration and
[01:28:19] instincts it demands repetitive movement develop muscle memory so there's there's other benefits
[01:28:23] to to utilizing firearms than just self protection training competitive flee for speed and accuracy
[01:28:30] conditions you for high pressure situations by teaching the need to relax to attach and get
[01:28:35] control your breathing and focus on the immediate task and like you can apply that to anything
[01:28:38] not just a shooting so there's some some real benefits to firearms and then I go on here but
[01:28:45] firearms are not always available there are many places in the world we're carrying a gun as
[01:28:49] illegal there are also times where firearms malfunction is also important to know how to defend
[01:28:53] yourself in on our situations which brings us back to martial arts first let me say that the
[01:28:58] martial arts are very emotional for some people their martial art becomes their religion and may
[01:29:04] become blinded by it martial arts are not static they evolve all with they evolve all the time
[01:29:10] if you do not evolve with them you will be left behind picking one martial art versus another or
[01:29:15] saying that one martial art is better than another martial art drive some people crazy I do not
[01:29:21] engage in irrational theoretical discussions on which martial art is best there's no reason to
[01:29:26] theorize anymore the ultimate fighting championship put many theories to the test the war's
[01:29:31] an Iraq and Afghanistan also put many theories to the test about hand-to-hand combat finally every
[01:29:37] person now carries a video camera in their pocket and there are thousands of street fights and
[01:29:42] confrontations to watch on the internet with all that information readily available there is no need
[01:29:48] to theorize anymore it is easy to see what works and what doesn't furthermore it is also
[01:29:54] obvious that martial arts are not stagnant they evolve people develop new techniques and new moves
[01:29:58] to counter other techniques and other moves but they but the fundamental principles do not change
[01:30:03] they only become reinforced and I give some advice here start with Brazilian jujitsu
[01:30:12] it is a form of grappling that is highly advanced because for the most part the actual fighting
[01:30:16] takes place on the ground this is a key point because our first form of self-defense is to get away yes
[01:30:23] run if you are confronted by another person or a group of people the best thing you can do is run
[01:30:28] away avoid the conflict this is relatively easy if someone is trying to strike with you or strike
[01:30:34] you with punches or kicks they do not have control over you so you can simply run away from them
[01:30:40] you have one the problem comes in a self-defense situation when someone is grabbing you
[01:30:47] now they are preventing your first line of defense running as soon as someone grabs you you are in
[01:30:53] a grappling scenario and one of the most critical parts of Brazilian jujitsu is escaping someone's
[01:30:59] grip so you can run oftentimes an attacker will take you to the ground in order to prevent you
[01:31:04] from escaping their grip when this happens the ability to ground fight is used not to stay on the ground
[01:31:10] but to get up and get away from the attacker the first goal of a beginner in jujitsu is not to get
[01:31:16] the fight to the ground but to get up off the ground and get away this is an important distinction
[01:31:22] from people who believe the goal of self-defense in jujitsu is to get the attacker to the ground
[01:31:27] this is not true the goal is to get away but as has been seen over and over again fights
[01:31:34] often end up on the ground and therefore a person must be prepared for it not training in jujitsu
[01:31:39] because you don't want to go to the ground is like not learning to swim because you don't want
[01:31:43] to go in the water it doesn't make sense the safest way to deal with the water is to be comfortable
[01:31:48] in it just as being comfortable on the ground is the best way to deal with that scenario should it
[01:31:53] unfold in real life questions comments from echo trolls i agree we can reach back to your days many
[01:32:02] days on the front lines of the bouncing one yeah i agree that is yeah i agree i can't disagree at all
[01:32:11] one of the primary arguments that people give when they you know Brazilian jujitsu is no good
[01:32:17] for self-defense why would you take someone to the ground why are you taking them around
[01:32:20] that's not going to run out doing that we're trying to get away yeah so you know i have to
[01:32:23] like that the muscle when we do the jujitsu part and you notice this and you actually pointed it out
[01:32:29] which i liked go whatever you where i said if i choose to fight this guy you know how like i'll
[01:32:34] go through the basic thing when if i come front this guy it's come front for me and i choose to fight
[01:32:38] them so it's way different than self-defense that's like i chose to fight this person and most
[01:32:43] of the time you you add in just like i said earlier where if you don't have a choice to run like
[01:32:46] in the grab your whatever there is that too for sure but yes if you choose to fight them then yeah
[01:32:52] you can take into a ground whenever now your choice to fight them is going to be based on
[01:32:56] the bunch of other things and the better be intelligent because if you're like yeah i'm at the
[01:33:00] club you said this and whatever and then you just you're fighting yeah i don't know if that's
[01:33:04] and you know uh uh the right choice and now you get a whole different issue then the self-defense
[01:33:09] situation you know that's like a choice and you made it whatever but yeah if you're you know
[01:33:13] i don't know fighting with your friend after not your friend but your enemy after school and
[01:33:17] everyone's like circle i don't know whatever there there's there's choices to be made in
[01:33:21] if the right choice is to fight the guy and then yes bring the shoes well then yeah so so then you
[01:33:27] can use jiu jitsu but now you're using it in an offensive situation and so yes you probably will
[01:33:33] want to take the person to the ground yeah i mean if it's if it's a like a one on one i'm choosing
[01:33:40] to fight because if it's four on one and you're choosing to fight you're just being stupid yes
[01:33:43] you're about to get your ass beat yes or yeah the very high likely yes yeah the oh
[01:33:49] i do have a question about the firearms train like you know how you train in stressful situations
[01:33:54] what kind of stressful situations can you like put yourself in or whatever uh there's some obvious
[01:34:00] ones the most obvious one is time constraints so hey i want to get these shots off as quick as
[01:34:05] possible and i'm competing against you know echo's going against me and we're trying to see who
[01:34:08] wins there's a little bit of stress there but also hey do 30 burpees and then shoot six head blades
[01:34:15] right through your breathing hard sprint reload reload drills um this all those things that
[01:34:21] that there's a million different ways i mean you can i'm sure those were enough to kind of spark
[01:34:26] your creativity on what you can do to make it stressful yeah fully the time because i went
[01:34:31] it was the last time i went but i went to the range with keen and cornealious and we did we just
[01:34:36] did like a simple fun like contest you know kind of like shooting replay horse yeah paper
[01:34:41] what are you kind of like that kind of situation i mean i actually filmed it but the video
[01:34:46] kind of got one kill is gonna release it but that that did add a little something because it like
[01:34:53] if you miss or you would ever it meant something kind of thing but it i didn't i'd never felt
[01:34:57] i wouldn't label it as a stressful training scenario but time constraints if it's like okay you
[01:35:03] got time it's trying to get better at it and it's a competition i mean when you're in this
[01:35:07] year themes you're doing freaking competitive shooting against every i basically all the time
[01:35:12] you're shooting against somebody where you shoot against three people or four people or whatever so
[01:35:17] you you you you have that level of stress but then it's also you know you're going to run
[01:35:21] you're going to run up that berm you're going to drag that tire you're going to come back over here
[01:35:24] you're going to shoot six head plates you're going to go back you're going to get on your
[01:35:26] long gun you're going to put down this one you got all these things that you got it and it's all
[01:35:31] a race and they're just trying to make you freak out and then on top of that you know once you
[01:35:34] get into the sim unition now you've got you're you're you're not shooting real bullets but you're
[01:35:38] shooting you got people maneuvering you got people you know you're you're you're throwing flash
[01:35:42] glass and we got grenades going off like all kinds of mayhem and sim munition is just as loud
[01:35:47] as loud as it like night and day like night and day yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:35:53] because that i feel like and obviously i've never been in a straight up gun fight with anyone like
[01:35:58] they're shooting at me actually that up but i would imagine that just hearing other gunshots going on
[01:36:09] and you know that they're at you or intended for you whatever that's going to just bring you out of
[01:36:14] your whole shooting game yeah the noise of gunshots it's like if you hear it a lot less and when you're
[01:36:21] when you're shooting like at somebody you're nearing the game yeah like it's a lot less
[01:36:27] a lot less it's not that it's not like the like the like the little shock that you get when you're
[01:36:32] at the range or whatever okay even even actually if you get you know you get like a good
[01:36:39] stress scenario going even in a training situation you won't really like notice big time
[01:36:45] and we used to do our drills this is back in the back in the turn they used to man this is
[01:36:52] this is i don't recommend it but they would make us do some of our immediate action drills
[01:36:56] with no your protection in so that we would like quote get used to it yeah but this allow
[01:37:03] yeah so it and that was something too that else wasn't even worth so if you're in the field straight
[01:37:09] up or alone you do you have your protection yeah you have well nowadays we have this and this is
[01:37:15] another thing that's pretty crazy is we have the headsets that are noise canceling headsets
[01:37:20] and the reason you're wearing them is because you're on the radio so it's it's your headphone
[01:37:24] for your radio so you can hear and it's a noise canceling headset so when a loud noise goes off
[01:37:30] it cancels out that noise so so okay so when was the first time you ever shot a gun
[01:37:36] in my life yeah in your life it's very like eight or nine I think maybe ten yeah
[01:37:44] something else they got to go to younger than ten but I was I was up in Maine and I went out to
[01:37:50] my friend was a little older than me we went out to his uncle's farm and shot yeah so
[01:37:59] the so you weren't like surprised by how freaking loud a gun is then no but I think I think what
[01:38:09] you're getting at is people that I don't really remember enough of like my introduction of
[01:38:14] firearms to get what you're getting at which is firearms are freaking loud way louder than anything
[01:38:21] they could portray in the movies or whatever yeah hundred percent yeah because that it just look
[01:38:26] again I've never been in a firefight but it just seems like when you imagine it where when it
[01:38:31] kicks off and you didn't kick it off with a first shot if someone else shot by the first shot seems
[01:38:37] like you just be out of the game if you're not used to it yeah well you definitely that's another
[01:38:42] thing is you get so used to gunshots in the seal teams from your training that that doesn't
[01:38:51] really like it's not a shock anymore yeah so a costume here it's not it's not shocking it's like oh
[01:38:57] yeah that's true oh where's that coming from right yeah even like when you're also the distance you know
[01:39:01] when someone's a little bit further away from you the the shock is a lot less when you get away from it you
[01:39:08] know thanks the the the concussion of the shot yeah now if they're in the same room as you it can be
[01:39:14] pretty pretty dynamic right we should ask Mike Day oh yeah how that gonna yeah man yeah it's crazy
[01:39:24] like when okay so when you go to the gun range let's say you know it's your first time or whatever
[01:39:28] the gun range when you walk in that door and you hear other people shooting your like yeah
[01:39:32] okay so have you shot outdoors yet yeah yeah okay because it's a lot different shooting outdoors
[01:39:37] in indoors yeah a lot different yeah yeah I don't think I even it was actually the first time I shot
[01:39:43] a gun think one of the early times anyway was was outdoors and I don't think we even had your
[01:39:49] protection and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we were shooting like some louder ones
[01:39:57] okay 45 shot done for we're shooting clay clay pigeons or whatever um and yeah I remember them
[01:40:04] being loud like for real loud even outdoors but compared to indoors it's it was nothing
[01:40:11] because if you don't wear your protection like at the regular indoor gun range like but you might
[01:40:16] know issues yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure
[01:40:19] but it's good to condition it's good to stress condition it's good to get used to those noise
[01:40:23] it's good to get used to all those things this is well there's what we train for and we should
[01:40:27] not just relegate training to just being in the military we should train for you know other
[01:40:31] things that can happen in life and if you are gonna have a fire I'm damn well better trained with it
[01:40:36] um going back to the jiu-jitsu thing I want to read this other little section another reason
[01:40:41] I recommend starting martial arts by learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu is because it is the most complex
[01:40:46] of the martial arts although there is a finite number of moves and positions there is an infinite
[01:40:54] number of moves beyond the basics and more developed every day in this constantly evolving art
[01:41:01] due to this unending depth in jiu-jitsu it is also the most cerebral of martial arts
[01:41:09] it provides incredible mental stimulus and a never-ending challenge to learn develop and improve
[01:41:15] jiu-jitsu never gets old the next martial art I recommend is learning boxing
[01:41:21] boxing is an incredibly effective striking art despite its relative simplicity there are only two
[01:41:27] weapons in boxing the whole f-tand in the right hand but with those two weapons and incredible
[01:41:32] advantage can be gained if you know how to throw them in effective combinations other critical elements
[01:41:37] learned in boxing our angles movement both of which are based heavily on fortwork and speed which
[01:41:43] are utilized in both both the offense and defense of boxing with basic boxing knowledge a person
[01:41:50] can throw effective punches and avoid being punched both extremely useful assets when attempting to
[01:41:54] attempt the primary goal of self defense run boxing develops the ability to hit quickly avoid being hit
[01:42:01] and run away from the area of confrontation so that's just regular western boxing
[01:42:10] and this is sort of like again this is my recommendation if you're starting from ground zero
[01:42:14] you know nothing this is how I would go about it there can be some argument made that if you were going
[01:42:26] to a place tomorrow that you needed to be ready to begin attacked then maybe like you look at
[01:42:34] some other form of martial arts but if that's your situation like it's not smart I mean and you
[01:42:43] know by that I mean some of these I don't even know if that's a true statement yeah I mean it's
[01:42:48] what I think it might be I think it is one of the statements where it just straight up depends
[01:42:52] so depends on what what do you mean you're going to be attacked like just by a person and is
[01:42:56] that person be trained or not untrained or they be bigger than you or they can be equal sized
[01:42:59] of you know or smaller or weapons or yeah and then it depends on who like okay you might learn
[01:43:05] you know and what is it like okay you might need these these kind of blitz martial arts type
[01:43:10] situation like a crowd from a god you know or whatever whatever some cool system I think I would
[01:43:15] in a read actually told me that I think in a read was like you know if you had like one day
[01:43:20] I would teach somebody some basic crowd from a god stuff yeah and and that could be true for sure
[01:43:25] if you know if the the instructors teaching you for that reason yeah you just got one day let's
[01:43:30] pack it in or and then even a jujitsu scenario here's a problem of that statement now that I think
[01:43:35] through it in my opinion the problem of that statement is if you really think that that one day is
[01:43:40] going to help you you're an idiot yeah like if I be the best you could do but it only going to
[01:43:46] give you a 1% better chance than you know so don't get yourself in that situation that's why
[01:43:51] you make martial arts a part of your life yeah it's it's got to be a life thing yeah but the
[01:43:56] thing is that is a thing though where like even Tim Ferriss sort of studies it a little bit
[01:44:02] remember like because he took a thing a jujitsu thing where he was like hey I need to know that the
[01:44:06] most that I possibly can to be affected in the small short of this was like a TV show right
[01:44:11] it was yeah I was like one of the things yeah and I was like oh that's an interesting theory
[01:44:15] because that's not the way you change a jujitsu at all and you know they taught him like the
[01:44:19] guillotine was one of them that they taught because there's not all these like factors you
[01:44:23] have to kind of establish before you can execute to move or not as many or whatever that was kind
[01:44:28] of the thing and anyway the point is it introduced like an interesting approach to these things
[01:44:33] this real short term approach how can I get the most effectiveness out of it if I only have a short
[01:44:39] amount of time rather than infinite time you know so yeah yeah that's cool because you could also
[01:44:45] that that would be it be if you made if someone said I'm gonna go to this place tomorrow and there's
[01:44:51] a high likelihood I got attacked I would be taking I would I would be taking very small parts of
[01:44:56] various martial arts yeah that's what I think I would do but again I don't want to make that sound
[01:45:00] like its a solution because I don't want to sound like the freaking magazines to say defeat any attack
[01:45:04] and move to three moves it's a lie straight up it's a lie straight up don't think of it that way
[01:45:09] don't even forget I just said that here's the deal make martial arts a part of your life
[01:45:15] that's what you need to do back to the book the next two martial arts to invest time into our
[01:45:20] Moitai and wrestling they both add a plethora of options and skills to any fighter wrestling
[01:45:28] wrestling is a grappling art perhaps the most widely known in practice look I go through a
[01:45:34] bunch of stuff and I talk about Moitai and Moitai is awesome I think the reason that I put
[01:45:41] that I would train someone in boxing first before Moitai is just for the complexities like
[01:45:46] Moitai is just that much more complex you can throw out both you can throw knees you can throw
[01:45:49] kicks there's a lot more things to learn so the first thing I want to learn is how to throw hands
[01:45:54] you know how to throw hands get head movement get angles work distance like that's all going to come
[01:45:59] from just boxing without opening up because look I mean Moitai is savage bro Moitai is savage
[01:46:07] yeah that's one of the pain that's what I was going to say like that's what you get taught as well
[01:46:13] and not like a secondary teaching like one of the primary thinking is like kind of how fragile you are
[01:46:19] with pain where the kind of like okay or how much you can get used to it too exactly right that's
[01:46:24] part of the training you know that's what you do benefit from taking that pain like ribs legs is a
[01:46:29] huge one man like a leg kick body kick punch even when you kick somebody and it lands in the wrong
[01:46:37] spot but it's like hurts it's it's worse than most hits that you get like if you get punched in the
[01:46:45] face let's face it I mean it seems crazy whatever but it doesn't hurt that much even if you
[01:46:50] really get a good one it more knocks you like dizzy more than it actually is pain
[01:46:55] Moitai is straight up pain in a way sometimes you kind of wish you'd stop punching me below the
[01:47:01] freaking net or kicking one of just punch me in the face that's way better way more is
[01:47:07] really really you know sometimes but yeah you get used to that and that kind of training is very
[01:47:12] beneficial because men you kick even in like a real fighter whatever you give if you can
[01:47:18] effectively like leg kick somebody two even three times or something like this and they feel that pain
[01:47:23] like bro I want to watch the guy you're like oh you don't know like I got kicked on like you
[01:47:28] think no big deal you don't know no here actually I was like trying to think what I said
[01:47:33] Moitai adds a massive arsenal of striking options to a fighter where boxing utilize is only two
[01:47:37] fists Moitai utilize his fist elbows knees and the shins in very aggressive combinations that are
[01:47:41] absolutely devastating in a fight Moitai is also about pain and the ability to withstand pain
[01:47:48] legit talk about shame conditioning in there so definitely look Moitai awesome wrestling
[01:47:56] clearly is just freaking awesome um wrestling is a grappling art the physical grind of wrestling
[01:48:04] hardens the body and mind without mercy on top of the conditioning and mental toughness
[01:48:12] derived from wrestling it is also the king of position in martial arts and we see this from the
[01:48:16] UFC this is why the rest of us dominate in the UFC meaning a good wrestler can decide what position
[01:48:21] they will be in during a competition no other martial art provides a practitioner a better ability
[01:48:27] to dictate the position of a fight with one simple idea the main focus of wrestling is to get
[01:48:32] the opponent to the ground and keep them there so then I say once a good base is and again there's
[01:48:39] a bunch of details on wrestling on Moitai on boxing once a good base is established in Brazilian
[01:48:43] institutes boxing wrestling and Moitai there are plenty of other martial arts to explore judo is a fantastic
[01:48:52] art and has very effective take down especially against opponent wearing a jacket or shirt
[01:48:58] sombo what talk about krav maga i talk about screaming kali and the dog brothers you know
[01:49:03] dog brothers vaguely yes the dog brothers are legit about as legit as it gets
[01:49:09] a they and they've been around for a long time but for those of you that don't know the dog
[01:49:15] brothers they would have these fights with weapons and basically you would wear the guys would wear
[01:49:24] like lacrosse gloves i guess to protect their fingers and they would wear
[01:49:30] some kind of like hockey helmet to protect their heads and then they would use various weapons
[01:49:37] they would use sticks they would use chains they would use canes just all and they would go at it
[01:49:44] like they would fight like they would fight and you could tap out but they were gonna fight you
[01:49:47] were gonna get hit and you can go watch those videos of dog brothers but what was cool about is they
[01:49:52] may be around for a very long time and it was the most realistic you know it's the most realistic
[01:49:58] weapons fighting i think that that that i've seen and and then they would try and learn from it
[01:50:04] and all that so very cool stuff that they taught and trained in and then i say the list
[01:50:09] you go on and on there's there's no reason to ever stop training in learning martial arts
[01:50:14] of course it is good to be prepared to handle a self defense situation but the benefits of
[01:50:19] martial arts training go far beyond self defense of course you get physically conditioned you also
[01:50:23] get mentally tougher real martial arts are hard they they are a mental and physical grind
[01:50:29] if the martial art you are training in as easy it isn't likely doing much good martial arts also
[01:50:38] get you used to being a non comfortable situations and continuing to fight on this is an
[01:50:42] important in any endeavor martial arts will make you better so train don't think about it don't take
[01:50:47] time to get in shape before you start just go start the rest will come and then i have a whole
[01:50:52] section in here about where to train what type of academy what are you looking for thank god the
[01:50:58] world is improving where this jujitsu everywhere now look we're gonna get through this COVID thing
[01:51:02] here shortly and all the jujitsu jams will be back open have a section in here on a immediate action
[01:51:10] drills facing a threat so i'm like talking about what you actually do when bad things are happening
[01:51:16] you know we get mass shooting situations we got all kinds of problems out there and you know
[01:51:22] I wanted to talk about how you handle those situations the next section by the hit every
[01:51:31] controversial the next section is called feeding the machine and the first section in here and by
[01:51:37] the way you know everyone's gonna comment about you know it's funny is like people comment you
[01:51:41] know we've had some some excerpts put out from us talking about martial arts and there's people
[01:51:46] that would say would call out certain things now read through the comments and oh yeah that's
[01:51:50] well that's actually accurate i i shouldn't have said that right i didn't mention that or whatever so
[01:51:55] if you're gonna get all ham if you get all ham in the comments go for it and uh we'll maybe
[01:52:02] we'll address them on the grounded podcast but um some good points are made in there and like i
[01:52:07] said these are these are if if you consider your martial art a religion and something that i said
[01:52:13] i tacked your religion if you're a diehard mojtai and you think that i'm saying that jujitsu is
[01:52:18] better you know like and you want to bring it i'm sorry i mean it's just this is my thoughts you
[01:52:25] can disagree that's cool mojtai is awesome wrestling is awesome boxing is awesome you jujitsu is awesome
[01:52:32] i love them all train them all it's all good but it's controversial for some people yes some people
[01:52:39] it's a religion if you gotta be careful that so when talking about fuel like what we are
[01:52:48] going to eat this is another thing that can become you know kind of controversial and people get
[01:52:55] crazy on i got a section here says addicted to sugar sugar is truly addictive it stimulates the
[01:53:02] same parts of the brain as heroin and cocaine when you have it you want more of it and you know this
[01:53:09] to be true that's why you can't stop eating it and when you do stop eating it you will feel with
[01:53:16] troll headache irritation anxiety lies the lies will come and they will come from you the lies
[01:53:24] you tell yourself are it's no big deal i can just have a little it isn't worth it to feel this
[01:53:30] bad the body needs carbs you will rationalize and start to listen to lies don't stay strong get off
[01:53:37] the sugar train get off the addiction stop eating sugar cocaine and heroin people don't you know
[01:53:48] what the rat's eat ah fuel look i talk about i talk about what to eat and again this is a religion for
[01:54:00] some people for a lot of people it's a religion i kind of you know hey here's what i think here's
[01:54:06] what i eat you know i eat these things beef poultry fish eggs not subedged the pulse
[01:54:13] fungi roots some dairy limited fruits are you want to get crazy on that cool you want to attack me cool
[01:54:22] kind of fungi your mushrooms I guess and ringworm I guess i'll have a double ringworm sandwich please
[01:54:31] uh don't eat these grains potatoes refined salt refined sugar processed oils right so it's just
[01:54:40] basic stuff let's not get crazy um fasting talk about fasting this section starts off news flash you don't
[01:54:52] have to eat fasting is a gift actually my dot my resting my middle daughter of that Russell
[01:55:00] she told me she would think about this because when she would be cutting weight she'd be thinking
[01:55:06] she would think but i talk about in here you know the human body can live for a long time here we go
[01:55:13] humans can survive 30 days without food you can make it in extra few hours you can actually make it a
[01:55:17] few days without any issue i fast 24 hours regularly i do 72 hours fast approximately every three
[01:55:23] months and you know what they aren't that big of a deal when i'm fasting i still do everything i would normally
[01:55:28] do if i were eating i would work out i train you did to i drink water some tea maybe eat some sunflower
[01:55:36] seeds poop freak you're not fasting you ate a sunflower seed that's what i do
[01:55:42] like take it easy uh so i have something to chew on but fasting isn't that hard and you will
[01:55:49] feel better at the end of it this is my favorite thing fasting will recalibrate what hunger is to you
[01:55:55] you'll realize that you aren't actually hungry most of the time you're just bored and at the end of
[01:56:00] a fast your food will taste better too that is a factual beautiful thing food tastes good
[01:56:06] when you uh when you do that so a whole section on fasting a bunch of benefits from that got a
[01:56:12] section here dealing with injuries and illness you are going to get injured you are going to get sick
[01:56:21] regardless of how careful you are in training you how clean you eat and how healthy you live
[01:56:26] you are still human injuries and illness will occur my theory for overcoming injuries and illness
[01:56:31] is simple do what you can if you're sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip or
[01:56:38] workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can hurt your knee work your upper body work the good
[01:56:44] leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm pull up some pushups focus on your core and legs
[01:56:50] until your shoulder heals up 10 to 90s from using your grip too much sounds like it's time to
[01:56:54] focus on sprinting and jumping the plyometrics got a little cold flu same thing do what you can
[01:57:00] maybe it's just going for a walk a couple sets of situps and pushups but don't just stay in bed
[01:57:04] all day now sometimes you get playing knocked out by illness or a virus if it is that bad and
[01:57:11] your body absolutely needs rest good listen to your body and take the rest also don't bring your
[01:57:17] disease to the gym and spread it around work out at home same thing with injuries if some
[01:57:22] injury prevents you from doing the physical things you like to do good do what you can work on some
[01:57:27] skills you can do pick up a guitar write a book draw paint compose a song blog
[01:57:34] create learn do something take advantage of physical injuries and sickness by doing something you
[01:57:40] don't normally have time for in other words get after it and I recently did that when I got
[01:57:49] COVID I was like oh cool I can't I can't literally leave my house apparently not supposed to
[01:57:56] interact with anybody so and everybody kind of knew I had it so it's cool and I just like playing
[01:58:03] guitar a bunch and started digging into all bunch I've been I've been playing guitar for 35
[01:58:09] years and I've been at the same level for about 34 and half years and in the past two weeks
[01:58:16] I've advanced 10 fold on my understanding so this isn't just me saying this is actually
[01:58:22] something to do more you do that to the more you get used to that protocol you know where
[01:58:29] you know how like sometimes like your workouts or your whatever is like that's like your main
[01:58:34] jam like and then you get hurt and then you're all you know you can get depressed or just be so
[01:58:40] unhappy that you're out of game can't change you get to and people get awful but if you're
[01:58:45] used to that protocol where it's like it essentially opens up opportunity for new
[01:58:50] developments and growth you know for yourself literally making you a better person right so
[01:58:54] that becomes a protocol a normal protocol when you get injured it's automatic you're like okay
[01:58:58] I'm injured hey whatever junk but whatever and then this protocol kind of ensues
[01:59:03] and then boom you're kind of like you're kind of into that for a little bit yeah because getting injured
[01:59:10] it's for people like you for people like me that are really like do physical stuff
[01:59:16] getting injured is so horrible but I I will say I have this protocol when I'm like a cool
[01:59:23] when I when I do remember when I heard my elbow like Dean from the bank in my elbow
[01:59:28] I mean I was in a sling I've never been to sling in my life but like the next day or maybe it was
[01:59:34] one day later like at first I couldn't even do anything but then I was in doing one arm kettlebell
[01:59:40] swing snatches and stuff else like okay cool what you're gonna work through this it'll get better
[01:59:44] over time that's what's gonna take but whatever it's like a cut like even couldn't play guitar though
[01:59:49] damn pro brutal the initiating like the the first thing you do is essentially see what you can
[01:59:56] do and can't do and then from there you just go forward where it's like yeah you do what you can
[02:00:00] physically but we know that's not kind of it's hard to be like mentally on that same level as
[02:00:06] far as like your enthusiasm to pursue work out surgery, get through whatever when you're just doing
[02:00:11] what you can do especially if it's a significant injury but if you can do this other stuff now you know
[02:00:17] you can focus on other stuff or whatever you have like yeah and you just gonna mission who you are
[02:00:21] in your mission you mission you mission straight up there's a whole section like I said appendix
[02:00:29] is just all kinds of workouts from beginner workouts that literally any human being can do
[02:00:34] to advance workouts that will crush whoever and they're all written down in there and then
[02:00:43] well let me just read the last page of this book let's give it away the spoiler
[02:00:48] the section called do and it says don't just read this book don't just listen to the podcast
[02:00:57] don't just watch videos online don't just take notes don't just study them don't just share
[02:01:05] them with your friends don't just plan don't just mark your calendar don't just get motivated
[02:01:13] don't just talk don't just think don't just dream no none of that matters the only thing that
[02:01:26] matters is that you actually do so do and there you go that's that's the book and
[02:01:46] you know I think that this book obviously as I started off this book is something that
[02:01:51] anyone can use it something that I actually use something that I have used in dire situations to
[02:02:00] help me and something I use on a daily situation to help me something that something that we could
[02:02:06] all use to look at to remind us to keep us on the path it's a very present sense of message do you
[02:02:15] like that it's very present sense of message yeah I do like that thank you just there looking at you
[02:02:25] sending a message and the message is disappointing was freedom so get after it
[02:02:34] so echo we we want to get after it do you have any recommendations on how we do that or how
[02:02:45] we can keep doing that. this book is like the ultimate like New Year's book you know people
[02:02:54] they'll make like the New Year's Resolution you know but usually because you know how they say like
[02:03:01] a lot of most whatever I don't know that number like resolutions they'll fail after whatever
[02:03:05] amount of times. yeah something's something yeah but think when you think about it when you have
[02:03:11] the manual you don't have to it doesn't have to fail like you just refer to the manual it's a you know
[02:03:18] it's a thing rather than let's face it it was like when you make a New Year's Resolution it's kind
[02:03:28] of like oh I just sort of intend to get in shape you don't have a path on the plan of full
[02:03:33] action you know you just have an intention boom you got it right there you know so one of those things
[02:03:40] in fact I would argue that if you're like okay this is my kind of like I was saying with the owners
[02:03:45] manual of a car if you just if you have this and you treat it as your owner's manual for your
[02:03:52] New Year's Resolution or for your life in general it should be for your life in general yes but I'm
[02:03:57] saying if you want to slide it in and have it serve that particular purpose how are the moment
[02:04:03] I like you know what I think is cool is giving it this on one give the gift of discipline
[02:04:12] give the gift of discipline just make me wish freedom field manual Markorn motto oh by the way
[02:04:17] the name of this is Markorn motto that's from the military term it's when they modify things
[02:04:23] here so the mark one is like this is the first model of it then mod one is the first modification
[02:04:29] the first mod that they make so there's a modification to this one my head is bigger on the cover
[02:04:35] yeah that's the mod right there wait wait wait wait wait what is Mark one what is Mark one is it's like
[02:04:39] a model number yeah but they just call them mark yeah it's in the Navy yeah well it's in
[02:04:46] cameras as well so you got the cannon so cannon 5D mark I'm going to the one for the have
[02:04:55] Mark one okay so cannon 5D Mark one then this Mark two and then this Mark three got it
[02:05:02] yeah so they could have said Mark one and if they made like small changes to it probably
[02:05:07] mod one if they did like a full revamp then it's Mark two yeah so you could get you know a weapon system
[02:05:15] sure that it is the mark one it's the but then they add a new front sight to it you're like
[02:05:20] okay this Mark one mod one still one they add a new rear sight and it's like oh Mark one
[02:05:25] mod two so you can keep doing that so this this field manual and what's cool I will say
[02:05:31] I have a lot of what is it creative control so my publisher I said yes gonna be Mark one mod one
[02:05:39] that what's there like they didn't have any idea what this is I might as well say they're
[02:05:43] Google Blue they're like they're not like you wouldn't talk about but they're going
[02:05:47] yeah so credit it does sound cool Mark one mod one yeah well I'm glad you think it sounds cool
[02:05:52] better than Google Blue is tactical but the Mark okay so you you would actually not
[02:05:59] to spend go too deep on this Mark one mod one ummm workings but okay so what what's it
[02:06:05] because you said the guns before something Mark one like what which gun no we don't the guns
[02:06:12] are actually army weapons some markers from like the navy yeah but you like what was the okay what
[02:06:20] machine gun did you hear why can't we have four M4 there you go that was the one yeah the army
[02:06:26] it's just M though it's not Mark also M4 is Mark 4 no no M4 is the gun and then it's Mark one
[02:06:33] no they don't even do it with guns it's like a more of a navy term good yeah well they do it
[02:06:40] with camera straight out I have a boat called the Mark 5 okay all right well I'm gonna leave that to
[02:06:47] the navy and the weapon system scenario and cameras by the way because I don't know if I have
[02:06:52] grasp on it yet but I'll tell you what I do have a grasp on it's how we can all stay stay on the
[02:07:00] path or get on the path if you not on the path already when you're on the path you're gonna find
[02:07:07] out that it's hard it's not always easy it's actually not even always hard technically
[02:07:12] but it does get hard from time to time sometimes you need assistance sometimes you need supplementation
[02:07:17] and it's true jocquoise has us covered jocquoise fuel okay so if your if your joints are in need
[02:07:25] of supplementation with that joint supplements joint warfare what's called first one super
[02:07:31] krill oil it's the second one for your joints but we want to blend into immunity stuff we got vitamin D
[02:07:39] three also cold war boom joints immunity covered don't even think about those anymore put that
[02:07:48] into your daily discipline routine every morning or every night whatever boom you don't got
[02:07:54] to worry about that can stuff anymore also discipline and discipline go now this is a cognitive
[02:08:02] supplement similar to what sleep does really you talked about brain derived new tropic factor number
[02:08:09] 99 or whatever you're saying it's kind of the same thing this is number 100 mark mark 100 over here
[02:08:17] either way it's kind of the same thing really yeah 100% bro that's coming up even some hardcore
[02:08:25] bro science I hit you with bro science today they're coming back and I like it and it's part of
[02:08:30] the game so part of the game nonetheless so discipline discipline go you know enhance your mind
[02:08:35] helps your cognitive abilities and physical abilities by the way many different modes that you
[02:08:39] um was a term you I'll get you primed right now which is the word you said I primed sir get the
[02:08:45] cognitive physical mental priming going on get your get a can of discipline go get the get the pill get
[02:08:51] the powder so before workouts I like the powder for that priming effect because there's there's
[02:08:57] regular priming and then there's like the secondary priming effect maybe or maybe more accurately
[02:09:02] put the psychological priming effect because you mix up the little discipline mix mega mix whatever
[02:09:11] mix it up and when you're drinking it it's like your mind is just just just getting ready
[02:09:16] psychologically not to mention all the physiological benefits you can say so it's like one on top of
[02:09:21] the other anyway it's part of the game but if you want to replace your current energy drink problem
[02:09:29] that's what it is. It's not even potentially it's a problem if you're drinking energy drinks
[02:09:38] normal energy it's a problem it's a problem because you're gonna sugar you're getting an overdose
[02:09:43] of caffeine you're gonna punch a chemicals in there that they use to preserve but there's like it's
[02:09:46] it's a absolutely it's a problem. Yeah okay I was gonna talk about this you know I'm gonna do it
[02:09:52] I'm gonna talk about it so anyway my kids watch this show I think it's called the victorious
[02:09:57] yes this show you'll never know this show ever yep I know you're young as daughter might actually
[02:10:03] watch it you said I will never know it and I said yes I will not I may not know you might over here
[02:10:08] it or what anyway it's kind of funny little show called victorious uh Ariana Grande's in it
[02:10:14] and Tor Tori don't look at me for help you know you know Tori's anyway they're from anyway
[02:10:21] um and so here's here's the thing here's an issue with all there not the issues are complex
[02:10:28] story kind of I'm trying to remember why you've been brought up but okay okay this is why so
[02:10:32] so my every time there's like a brand in there they go real odd they do a good job but it's real
[02:10:37] obvious what brand they're portraying but it's okay okay they'll have an apple computer but
[02:10:41] and it looks like an apple computer but instead of an apple it's a pair yeah so like instead of
[02:10:46] like AirPods they'll have a pair pods you know like it's real obvious right they do that with the
[02:10:50] brands they'll have a generic version of the brand just it can throw out the show right one episode
[02:10:56] there this one was actually a kind of like a little political episode almost a little freedom situation
[02:11:02] so they had this drink you soda called blue dog blue dog drink and then a guy from the
[02:11:11] FBI the federal bureau of interference came in and said hey we're getting rid of all it's
[02:11:18] we're banning it prohibition style we're taking off all the shelves and all the kids wage and
[02:11:24] before they wage this campaigning and hey it's that if it's freedom you know like people you know
[02:11:28] you shouldn't ban it for everyone just as certain people can't make choices whatever but what they
[02:11:34] did was they started making their own knockoff red dog soda and then they got busted and then
[02:11:39] anyway it was a thing right here's the thing here's a point I hope so we know what red or not red dog
[02:11:45] sorry blue dog you know what brand they're portraying yes I think that's pretty probably some
[02:11:50] energy drinks scenario is going on right that's what they're talking about so with our current in
[02:11:58] real life energy drinks scenario hey we have the freedom to drink whatever we want to drink
[02:12:05] but I think it would benefit everyone including yourself to make the right choice with that freedom
[02:12:12] now if energy drinks are your weakness hey that's no problem now now it's not a problem you just
[02:12:18] switch over to the discipline go in and can so it feels all that good energy drink right
[02:12:24] curie and there's not many but it fulfills all of them which is you get some energy from it
[02:12:29] but now instead of killing yourself in the same time literally by the way slowly literally
[02:12:36] you're helping yourself and improving your health well I would love to add something to this
[02:12:41] but no one's listening anymore I think that's how they will just go and figure us out
[02:12:47] oh yeah you can get this stuff at origin main dot com you can get this stuff at the
[02:12:52] vitamin shop you can get this stuff out you can get the drinks out wall wall by the way we'll
[02:12:56] be alive in wall wall whole east coast every store January 4th epic that's due in large part
[02:13:04] two troopers in Florida that went into the wall was and cleared shelves keep it up
[02:13:09] keep it up because from wall wall when when other stores see what we're doing in wall wall
[02:13:17] we'll get nationwide to now east coast west coast if you're on the east coast and you're going
[02:13:22] to wall wall clear it out support so that way west coast stores who knows which one it'll be
[02:13:28] that will get it in there we'll start to do what we what we like to call a world take over
[02:13:33] get rid of it and we will get rid of blue dog yeah blue dog and the rest of them with their weird
[02:13:40] colors we don't want to rely on the federal bureau of interference to get rid of unhealthy stuff
[02:13:47] we just do it we don't make the market do it yes making good decisions that's what we want to do
[02:13:52] sure and that's also moke protein in the form of a dessert straight up my little son for
