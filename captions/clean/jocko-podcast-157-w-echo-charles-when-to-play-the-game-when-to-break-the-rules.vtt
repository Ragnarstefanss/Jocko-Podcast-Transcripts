00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.68
This is jocopodcast number 157 with echo Charles and me jocow wheelink good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:11.84
I was in a seal platoon

3
00:00:13.24 --> 00:00:21.04
Serving as the assistant to commander in the late 90s note that means you know war going on that's what it means

4
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:23.04
So we were training

5
00:00:23.04 --> 00:00:24.72
We were training

6
00:00:24.72 --> 00:00:32.000
Hard and this platoon that I was in at the time we were going through urban training urban combat training

7
00:00:32.32 --> 00:00:35.52
And we were pretty far along in the training and we were

8
00:00:36.08 --> 00:00:38.56
Starting to get our our semi-unition

9
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:43.04
Which is like fake bullets our semi-unition and paint ball wars on

10
00:00:43.92 --> 00:00:46.88
Forsohn force training and we were doing

11
00:00:48.72 --> 00:00:50.72
Like multi day operations

12
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:57.60
So almost like a scenario like you've got a full scenario going on like there's bad guys in the city

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah, no, it's the concrete city the fake city

14
00:01:00.64 --> 00:01:05.20
With concrete buildings that are pretty much just the shells buildings and

15
00:01:06.56 --> 00:01:09.28
We're going against

16
00:01:09.68 --> 00:01:13.28
Up four seals we call up for that stands for opposing force

17
00:01:13.60 --> 00:01:17.60
So the opposing force there are other seals who are role players pretending to be bad guys

18
00:01:17.60 --> 00:01:22.08
They know our tactics they know our techniques they know our procedures and on this particular day

19
00:01:22.24 --> 00:01:25.44
They had captured one of our seals from our platoon

20
00:01:25.84 --> 00:01:30.56
The bad guys the role players was that part of the scenario or just they made it part of the scenario

21
00:01:30.88 --> 00:01:35.20
So whatever they did they cost confusion they caused mayhem they end up with one of our guys

22
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:38.24
Okay, just on their own though that was a part of the overall training

23
00:01:38.24 --> 00:01:41.92
Well, it is you know when I was running training we always did that too

24
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:45.60
So it's just a long standing kind of hey if you can capture one of the seals

25
00:01:45.60 --> 00:01:49.68
Yeah, yeah, you know all this like never leave a man behind right let's get a little leave a man

26
00:01:49.68 --> 00:01:51.68
Right, it's a little bit about them. So

27
00:01:52.56 --> 00:01:58.000
At this point like I said they had they had captured and I don't remember exactly

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.92
But they captured one of our guys and they had him in a building and it was a big a pretty big building like a pretty big but

29
00:02:04.88 --> 00:02:06.88
rectangular type building

30
00:02:08.16 --> 00:02:09.76
Five stories maybe

31
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:13.68
Maybe it's four stories but anyways they had them they didn't have them in the top floor, but they had him in like

32
00:02:13.68 --> 00:02:19.76
The the floor below the top floor so he's dealing the third four the fourth floor. I forget

33
00:02:20.88 --> 00:02:22.88
But they have the guy in there and

34
00:02:23.36 --> 00:02:27.52
Remember this is not there's no power in the city and it's the city is out in the middle of nowhere

35
00:02:27.76 --> 00:02:29.52
It's a fake city

36
00:02:29.52 --> 00:02:33.36
So you can hear everything right kind of you pretty much here what's going on?

37
00:02:33.36 --> 00:02:38.48
So they have our guy and they're like torturing him mock torturing him and of course

38
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:39.84
They're up there tell them like scream

39
00:02:39.84 --> 00:02:46.16
Scream out and easy Ellen and yet you know that they're feeding him what to yell to try and get us all riled up

40
00:02:47.28 --> 00:02:50.56
There they're he's screaming. They're gonna kill me

41
00:02:51.92 --> 00:02:53.92
They're gonna violate me

42
00:02:54.32 --> 00:02:59.92
Screaming so they have a good time with it and and so our standard operating procedures like oh

43
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:01.84
You know what okay, so there's a building needs to be cleared

44
00:03:01.84 --> 00:03:04.80
We go and we clear the whole building. We start on the ground floor we clear every room

45
00:03:04.80 --> 00:03:08.96
Then we go up to the next one we clear every room we go for the next one that means that there's not gonna be any bad guys

46
00:03:08.96 --> 00:03:10.96
That get get into your train

47
00:03:11.92 --> 00:03:16.48
There's not gonna be any bad guys in between your force which can cause a blue on blue

48
00:03:17.52 --> 00:03:23.04
So when you're gonna clear every room that means you're gonna move down these hallways and you're gonna go from the bottom of the top and that's just kind of the plan

49
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:25.04
Right sort of normal and

50
00:03:27.28 --> 00:03:30.08
Like I said we could we knew where they were so we immediately

51
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:32.32
Okay, we're gonna say for a guy

52
00:03:33.12 --> 00:03:35.12
We're all fired up and

53
00:03:35.12 --> 00:03:40.000
As we were we're doing this you know the the standard plan come up. We're okay

54
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.08
We're going this east door and we'll just clear the first floor in a second before we do you know and as I'm sitting there kind of listening to this

55
00:03:48.16 --> 00:03:52.32
I just said hey no let's do this instead let's just

56
00:03:53.60 --> 00:03:56.16
Sneak up to the building because you can get to the building behind other buildings

57
00:03:56.16 --> 00:03:59.60
You could find a little sneaky way to get there. I'm like let's sneak him in the dead space

58
00:04:00.24 --> 00:04:04.88
Dead space is areas where the enemy can't see you or where you can't see the enemy it's just areas where there's no

59
00:04:04.88 --> 00:04:11.36
Line of sight. I said let's let's go and there was an external stairs like a fire escape on the outside

60
00:04:11.36 --> 00:04:15.20
I want to I said let's go straight to the to the floor he's on

61
00:04:15.68 --> 00:04:19.44
We won't clear any of the other floors we won't clear any of the rooms will just go right in the

62
00:04:19.44 --> 00:04:21.44
Hong Kong directly to where he's at

63
00:04:22.80 --> 00:04:24.56
and

64
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:27.04
That was the plan so we did it and

65
00:04:28.96 --> 00:04:32.80
Yeah, and the thing was it was we were that was I had kind of a new

66
00:04:32.80 --> 00:04:38.96
Idea right like hey, let's just I'm not I'm not to believe me. I'm not saying I'm the first guy that ever thought it's I'm not

67
00:04:39.20 --> 00:04:43.12
I'm saying our mindset at that moment was hey this is what we're being trying to do

68
00:04:43.12 --> 00:04:46.80
We'll do it what we're trying to do so for anyone that's listening for any of my team guy brothers

69
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:50.24
I'm like you didn't think I'm not saying I thought I'm saying at that moment in time

70
00:04:50.32 --> 00:04:53.92
We were focused on doing it one way and I said, oh, let's do something a little bit different

71
00:04:54.80 --> 00:04:58.000
And then once I said it everyone's like yeah, yeah, because there was like

72
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.28
Everyone knew that was the right answer right but you just had to have that different look at it for a moment

73
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:05.68
And so we did it we went to the

74
00:05:06.08 --> 00:05:08.40
External start when we went up really quiet. There's anything

75
00:05:08.40 --> 00:05:12.88
We were like we're not gonna say because you know we and we call it clear and you say next room and all this other stuff

76
00:05:13.44 --> 00:05:15.04
We weren't gonna say anything

77
00:05:15.04 --> 00:05:19.04
We're just gonna stay quiet so we went all the way up the stairs really quietly we walk in and we can hear him

78
00:05:19.36 --> 00:05:24.24
Hear him yelling out the window like come but you better get him quick and all this stuff and then we go into the room

79
00:05:24.24 --> 00:05:28.72
Excitably and shoot all the up for in the back

80
00:05:29.76 --> 00:05:32.52
We killed him and we saved our hostage and it was one

81
00:05:33.28 --> 00:05:38.16
There was one seal cadre who we gave them and I'm not gonna give his actual nickname

82
00:05:38.16 --> 00:05:40.16
But his nickname was along the lines of

83
00:05:41.28 --> 00:05:42.80
semi Jimmy

84
00:05:42.80 --> 00:05:44.80
because semi-nation was

85
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:47.92
Well, semi-nation what we used and semi-Jimmy

86
00:05:48.48 --> 00:05:51.28
was really good at being a bad guy

87
00:05:51.28 --> 00:05:56.000
And so and he would laugh at us, you know we'd be moving through a building and you could hear him like

88
00:05:57.12 --> 00:06:04.64
If he shot you in the neck and he'd be aiming for your neck or you're nuts like he was gonna get you

89
00:06:04.64 --> 00:06:05.84
Have a good time with it

90
00:06:05.84 --> 00:06:10.60
And that's what you want know you want you guys go hard so semi-Jimmy we but we got this moment with

91
00:06:10.60 --> 00:06:13.60
Semi-Jimmy shot him in the back and they you know they were stoked

92
00:06:13.60 --> 00:06:16.80
You know, they could see even though they want to win and they want to beat us but they're still stoked

93
00:06:17.12 --> 00:06:19.12
He wasn't cackling he was you know

94
00:06:19.12 --> 00:06:23.12
He was stoked on it and so they died we saved we got so my point in this is that

95
00:06:24.48 --> 00:06:26.48
Sometimes you have to do things

96
00:06:27.60 --> 00:06:31.44
That the enemy's not gonna expect that people aren't gonna expect that your competitors not gonna expect

97
00:06:32.16 --> 00:06:34.16
The hard part about doing that

98
00:06:35.20 --> 00:06:39.28
It isn't actually doing the thing that they don't expect right

99
00:06:40.24 --> 00:06:45.04
It's because like I said other this is not what I what I said to do wasn't this

100
00:06:45.44 --> 00:06:47.04
You know miraculous

101
00:06:47.04 --> 00:06:49.04
Your reek a moment of

102
00:06:49.04 --> 00:06:51.04
Tactical genius it wasn't that

103
00:06:51.92 --> 00:06:52.92
This was a

104
00:06:52.92 --> 00:06:59.84
Anyone that would have taken a step back would have said like that's a good call. Let's do that instead, but we're all wrapped up in that situation

105
00:07:01.04 --> 00:07:05.04
And so you want to learn how to do that you want to learn how to and again

106
00:07:05.04 --> 00:07:08.88
It's about detaching but a couple things that will help you with that

107
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.44
One is don't be the person that's planning everything

108
00:07:12.92 --> 00:07:14.92
Don't be the person

109
00:07:14.92 --> 00:07:19.48
And and it's hard especially we talk about extreme ownership like and everyone wants to be a leader

110
00:07:19.48 --> 00:07:23.48
And I want to step up don't try not to be the guy that comes up with every plan

111
00:07:23.96 --> 00:07:25.96
Literally trying not to be that guy

112
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:31.08
Now are there times when you're a lower member where you want to like step up and come up the plane

113
00:07:31.08 --> 00:07:35.40
Yeah, I'm talking about when you're in a little actual leadership position when you're junior and you're

114
00:07:35.80 --> 00:07:39.56
You're trying to learn and you're trying to bring four-fideas. Yeah, man come up with some plans

115
00:07:39.56 --> 00:07:44.12
You know shoot that idea up because you're you're throwing out good ideas that are gonna get bounced off the boss

116
00:07:44.12 --> 00:07:48.84
But when you're the guy that's in charge trying not to be the guy that plans everything trying not to be the guy that makes every single call

117
00:07:48.84 --> 00:07:52.52
Let the subordinates plan or let the subirriers plan let other people

118
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:59.000
Come up with plans now are there situations where like there's you got to make calls of course there are there's a dichotomy right

119
00:07:59.64 --> 00:08:01.000
But

120
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.84
In that particular situation I didn't feel the need that I had to be the guy that came up with the plan like let other people do that

121
00:08:07.48 --> 00:08:13.72
And you know if someone else had come up with the come up with that standard plan and it was and I hadn't like

122
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:18.20
Detached I would have been like okay cool. That's what we're doing. We're you know on forward you know, but

123
00:08:19.64 --> 00:08:24.44
You have to allow other people to come up with plans the other thing is recognize

124
00:08:25.72 --> 00:08:29.000
That the the way you know of doing something might not

125
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:32.20
fit you might not know everything

126
00:08:33.88 --> 00:08:37.40
It's it's a good thing to always think to yourself you might not know everything

127
00:08:37.88 --> 00:08:39.88
Right, that's a good idea to have in your mind

128
00:08:39.88 --> 00:08:46.92
Or is that what I know might not work that's something else what I know might not work

129
00:08:47.24 --> 00:08:50.36
That's another really smart thing to

130
00:08:50.60 --> 00:08:53.72
Constantly replaying your head. They what I know might not work

131
00:08:54.20 --> 00:08:59.80
That's it then you know so that that means you got to have an open mind then you got to remember of course that rules

132
00:09:02.12 --> 00:09:04.12
Sometimes after break rules

133
00:09:04.12 --> 00:09:09.40
You have to be very judicious when you decide you're gonna break rules and there's some principles that

134
00:09:10.36 --> 00:09:13.72
That you cannot violate without

135
00:09:13.88 --> 00:09:15.88
massive

136
00:09:16.04 --> 00:09:23.40
Reason without a massively heavy reason and a way to mitigate the risks of breaking whatever those fundamentals are like cover move like there

137
00:09:24.28 --> 00:09:27.48
Cover move you should never violate cover move ever

138
00:09:27.48 --> 00:09:32.84
Except for when it just makes sense that you need to violate

139
00:09:33.56 --> 00:09:39.24
So that and that story right there are kind of leads into the first question of Q and I which we haven't had Q and Q and A in a while

140
00:09:40.92 --> 00:09:42.12
and

141
00:09:42.12 --> 00:09:44.12
the first question

142
00:09:44.44 --> 00:09:46.44
is

143
00:09:46.44 --> 00:09:48.60
Well go ahead first question first question

144
00:09:48.60 --> 00:09:56.92
You recently said hackworth was a rule follower most of his career but in about face the book

145
00:09:57.48 --> 00:10:03.88
He always talks about how he went against his command his rules how do you play the game but also act like hackworth

146
00:10:03.88 --> 00:10:10.52
Yeah, and so this is a classic example of the dichotomy leadership with regard to obeying rules

147
00:10:11.08 --> 00:10:12.28
and and

148
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:18.76
hackworth absolutely obey the rules and he obeyed them to the to the extremes sometimes if you remember in the book he

149
00:10:20.36 --> 00:10:21.96
He

150
00:10:22.12 --> 00:10:24.12
He worked in

151
00:10:24.12 --> 00:10:26.92
situations where he they were like the strictest

152
00:10:28.52 --> 00:10:34.44
In Garrison so like not in combat just in Garrison he would everything's perfect uniform if you remember when general moochiyamo was on

153
00:10:35.88 --> 00:10:38.92
And we talked to we talked him about meeting hack for the first time

154
00:10:38.92 --> 00:10:42.52
Mm-hmm and you know it's kind of like what was he like and he was like oh he was

155
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:48.60
High and tight haircut totally squared away that's following the rules to win tea

156
00:10:49.96 --> 00:10:53.88
And the other thing that he played he definitely played he played the game

157
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.32
Hackworth played the game he developed with

158
00:10:58.28 --> 00:11:03.40
He developed relationships with people that were senior to him people that were influential

159
00:11:04.12 --> 00:11:08.04
SLA Marshall who he went on tour with if you remember through Vietnam and as a lay marshley

160
00:11:08.04 --> 00:11:13.72
Didn't really respect but SLA Marshall had such big influence that he said hey, you know what I got to become bros with this guy

161
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:19.88
He played the game because Marshall had influence and

162
00:11:21.24 --> 00:11:24.28
He even took some hits you know took a little

163
00:11:24.68 --> 00:11:27.48
Frag for from for SLA Marshall

164
00:11:28.76 --> 00:11:33.96
But at the same time if his troops weren't getting the right treatment that he did he would do what he needed to do

165
00:11:33.96 --> 00:11:39.24
He would break rules to take care of them if he had to and at the same time

166
00:11:39.64 --> 00:11:43.16
He would follow the rules to a tea if you remember when he took over the Italian and Vietnam

167
00:11:44.44 --> 00:11:49.96
The hopeless and wanted to turn him into the hardcore he brought all their crap into the middle of the thing and said we're gonna fly it out

168
00:11:49.96 --> 00:11:52.44
I don't know more radio is no more guitars no no this other stuff you get it out

169
00:11:52.44 --> 00:11:54.68
So that's like following the rules to a tea

170
00:11:56.12 --> 00:12:01.16
But at the same time if he needed to like steal food for them or stakes something to get of you know

171
00:12:01.16 --> 00:12:03.16
He would do that stuff

172
00:12:03.16 --> 00:12:06.84
So he's constantly balancing that economy. Another thing he did is he

173
00:12:07.56 --> 00:12:10.52
He took these administrative jobs that he hated

174
00:12:12.68 --> 00:12:17.16
In order to rise through the ranks in order to become to get

175
00:12:17.72 --> 00:12:22.12
Get places to develop relations so so we could have more influence. He was assigned to the Pentagon

176
00:12:22.60 --> 00:12:28.28
He in the book he talks about the Pentagon being working in the Pentagon being a cluster phobic hole

177
00:12:28.60 --> 00:12:31.40
No more than 20 by 20 feet with 15 other people in it

178
00:12:31.40 --> 00:12:37.96
And he talks about his head you did say your paper your in in box would be filled when you showed up

179
00:12:39.08 --> 00:12:42.92
And you immediately the phone would be ringing you'd be talking to people all over the world

180
00:12:42.92 --> 00:12:46.28
If all the people in Vietnam they're calling you at their their time zone

181
00:12:47.72 --> 00:12:51.24
And so he didn't like this job, but guess what got the highest possible

182
00:12:51.64 --> 00:12:54.28
Valuations when he left why cuz he played the game

183
00:12:54.28 --> 00:13:00.60
And he built these relationships with with all these kernels and all these generals and all these people

184
00:13:00.60 --> 00:13:07.48
Let it influence those glove or johns and Pearson and countless others by doing what he needed to do and then when he needed to

185
00:13:08.20 --> 00:13:10.20
He broke the rules and

186
00:13:10.92 --> 00:13:13.48
Sometimes he went a little too far away breaking the rules and

187
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:17.40
When

188
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:23.80
He when he got out when they kind of drove him out after he did the big interview where he said hey we're not gonna win

189
00:13:24.12 --> 00:13:27.72
They went and drilled down into his camps and looked at the things that he had gone on there

190
00:13:27.72 --> 00:13:32.28
Said oh you were you're allowing this to happen you're allowing this to happen so he left himself a little bit vulnerable

191
00:13:33.48 --> 00:13:41.000
By breaking the rules a little bit too much so the a rule to learn from that is like don't do things that people can hold over you and for me

192
00:13:41.32 --> 00:13:46.04
The things that people can hold over you are things where you can't stand up and

193
00:13:46.04 --> 00:13:48.04
Say yes, that's what I did

194
00:13:48.68 --> 00:13:53.56
Yes, that's what I did hey my guys didn't hadn't had a good meal in

195
00:13:54.28 --> 00:14:00.44
Four weeks they've been in the field for three of those weeks and when they came out

196
00:14:01.16 --> 00:14:03.16
Guess what I

197
00:14:03.16 --> 00:14:09.48
I figured out a way to get some steak and I took it from the rear and I had it flown up using milley's and our helicopters and

198
00:14:09.72 --> 00:14:13.54
I've had it yep, that's what I did and if you want to you want to drop the hammer on me for that

199
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:15.24
Got it

200
00:14:15.24 --> 00:14:17.24
Now if you do that that's cool

201
00:14:17.24 --> 00:14:23.88
But there's some things rebate the rules where maybe you wouldn't be able to stand up tall and proud and say this is what I did

202
00:14:23.88 --> 00:14:28.92
And this is why I did it so you want to be careful that you don't do things that will allow

203
00:14:29.24 --> 00:14:32.04
People to hold things over your head and

204
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.24
For me things that are things like that are things that you can't stand up with your chest out and say this is what I did in this

205
00:14:39.24 --> 00:14:41.96
Why I do I know it wasn't within the regulations

206
00:14:41.96 --> 00:14:48.04
This is what I did this is why I do it and if I get fired because of that understood check

207
00:14:49.48 --> 00:14:54.60
Now here's where you get a little here's where we can we can

208
00:14:56.84 --> 00:14:58.84
Question hack for sure

209
00:14:59.80 --> 00:15:01.80
Let me ask you this

210
00:15:02.84 --> 00:15:03.80
If

211
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:08.76
Hack would have because okay, so he didn't play the game at the end he didn't play the game

212
00:15:08.76 --> 00:15:12.12
He went on an interview and said hey, we're not gonna win the war not the way we're fighting

213
00:15:12.12 --> 00:15:15.56
We're not gonna win the war within a few weeks. He was driven out of the army

214
00:15:16.12 --> 00:15:19.96
He didn't play the game at that moment, right? So let me ask you this

215
00:15:21.96 --> 00:15:23.96
If he would have played the game

216
00:15:25.08 --> 00:15:28.52
Just a little bit just it look we need to change our strategy if we're you know

217
00:15:28.52 --> 00:15:35.24
I mean if you would have just and then he would have stayed in and then he would have perhaps gotten promotion and got perhaps gotten to a position

218
00:15:35.24 --> 00:15:43.000
He actually had influence over the way the war was being fought if he had done that would he have been

219
00:15:43.72 --> 00:15:48.20
Better off would he have been able to better help the situation?

220
00:15:49.40 --> 00:15:53.32
Because I don't know once they drove now. It's not like that interview well

221
00:15:53.32 --> 00:15:56.04
I don't know we'd have to check the check the historical

222
00:15:56.84 --> 00:16:01.48
Sort of results of that interview. It's certainly started to sway public opinion and maybe that you know

223
00:16:01.48 --> 00:16:06.44
Maybe in his mind hey, I need to tell everyone what's going on so we can get out of here right?

224
00:16:07.40 --> 00:16:12.20
So maybe maybe that was the intention maybe that was the result maybe that helped

225
00:16:12.84 --> 00:16:15.96
Shut down the war eventually but maybe

226
00:16:16.92 --> 00:16:19.48
If he would have played continue to play the game

227
00:16:20.68 --> 00:16:26.36
He could have gotten to a position where he had more even more influence and could have changed the way the war was being fought

228
00:16:26.36 --> 00:16:29.80
I don't know. I'm sure we could have a long debate about that

229
00:16:29.80 --> 00:16:35.16
But that's as a leader something that you are going to

230
00:16:36.44 --> 00:16:39.80
Have to weigh out all the time and there's situations where

231
00:16:40.84 --> 00:16:43.16
And actually breaking news today

232
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:47.48
General Mattis just put in his resignation for

233
00:16:48.36 --> 00:16:50.36
Being secretary defense

234
00:16:50.68 --> 00:16:56.76
So is that's I don't have to talk about that when I get a little more information on is that him saying look

235
00:16:56.76 --> 00:17:00.20
I it's going to be better for me to make this statement by leaving or

236
00:17:02.76 --> 00:17:09.000
Would he have been better off staying there where he can at least still have a massive amount of influence because he's

237
00:17:10.04 --> 00:17:13.24
The secretary defense. We'll have to drill down on that one. That's a

238
00:17:15.24 --> 00:17:20.60
That's a good question both those are good questions and the bottom line is if you haven't read about face

239
00:17:21.24 --> 00:17:24.84
Read it and learn from oh guy name Colonel David hackworth

240
00:17:24.84 --> 00:17:26.84
Hmm

241
00:17:26.84 --> 00:17:28.84
Next question

242
00:17:29.40 --> 00:17:31.80
So I answer that question was sort of another question

243
00:17:32.84 --> 00:17:37.72
Kind of a question you get asked yourself yes, and that's a question and I've talked about this where

244
00:17:39.08 --> 00:17:41.72
If I tell you echo hey echo I want you to do this mission

245
00:17:41.72 --> 00:17:45.24
I want you to do this way take your opportunity to go do it and you disagree with what I'm telling you

246
00:17:46.28 --> 00:17:47.80
And you just say hey boss

247
00:17:47.80 --> 00:17:52.04
I don't want to do it that way and I said hey you shut up and do what I told you to do and you go you know what

248
00:17:52.04 --> 00:17:56.68
You can fire me what I'm not doing it. I go okay fine your fired and I get knucklehead over here

249
00:17:56.68 --> 00:18:00.92
Who's the yes man it comes in and I tell him to go to the mission where I told him to do it and he goes and doesn't get everyone killed

250
00:18:01.96 --> 00:18:04.52
What did it been better off if you said okay boss? I get it

251
00:18:05.08 --> 00:18:11.48
I I'll do it your way here some things I'd really like to not do and you go no I said no shut up and then you take your guys

252
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:15.16
You mitigate everything that you can actually there's an example of this in band of brothers

253
00:18:15.16 --> 00:18:21.24
Where major winners is being told hey send a reconnaissance element across the river again tonight and

254
00:18:22.44 --> 00:18:27.16
He doesn't want to do it the the war's almost over they had taken some casualties

255
00:18:27.16 --> 00:18:30.44
I think the night before when they did the same type of operation and he just says

256
00:18:31.16 --> 00:18:34.36
God it boss and then the guys go and they

257
00:18:34.92 --> 00:18:40.68
Sitting a they pretend to go out but they really just sitting the basement of a building on their side of the river

258
00:18:40.68 --> 00:18:46.92
And then later on they said yep, we went we came back we didn't find anything okay cool there's a perfect example

259
00:18:47.80 --> 00:18:53.72
Imagine if if major winners dick winners was like we're not doing it and now you get an ego contest with the kernel

260
00:18:53.72 --> 00:18:56.68
He's like oh yes you are no we're not okay fine your fired

261
00:18:56.84 --> 00:19:04.04
Let me get knucklehead over here who's gonna do what I told him to do who's it totally yes man and now we take that risk and guys get killed

262
00:19:04.04 --> 00:19:06.52
So so who is it?

263
00:19:06.52 --> 00:19:14.44
There's a there's a dick winners played the game he played the game so he could still have that influence and power and and still protect his guys

264
00:19:15.56 --> 00:19:16.60
Yeah

265
00:19:16.60 --> 00:19:19.88
Can get complex yeah, it's it's very that's why leadership is hard

266
00:19:20.60 --> 00:19:26.04
That's it's weird though because when you say it's complex when you say leadership is hard at the same time like

267
00:19:26.44 --> 00:19:33.32
You if you're a principal human being and you have principles and you know what's right and you're doing the right thing for the right reason

268
00:19:33.32 --> 00:19:37.48
The decisions are actually usually a little easier clear

269
00:19:37.48 --> 00:19:42.60
Yeah, they might not be easy, but they're clearer like I know what I'm supposed to do here. I got it

270
00:19:42.60 --> 00:19:45.80
Yeah, I'm gonna figure this one out yeah and

271
00:19:46.76 --> 00:19:48.76
This this I think applies to

272
00:19:50.04 --> 00:19:52.04
To most scenario where

273
00:19:53.80 --> 00:19:58.68
Like you be think of the big picture where if you're like hey, I'm gonna consider myself

274
00:19:58.68 --> 00:20:05.16
After everything's gonna be said and done, you know it kind of goes along with what you said like oh can you stand up and you

275
00:20:06.36 --> 00:20:12.20
You if you consider okay look back you're gonna they're because it's gonna come a point where you're gonna look back on this and

276
00:20:12.84 --> 00:20:18.28
You're gonna feel the way you're gonna feel right now, but later on how are you gonna feel about like how you handled it

277
00:20:18.28 --> 00:20:21.80
You know what decision you made and how you made to think to tell kids to

278
00:20:21.80 --> 00:20:29.80
You know like would you if you're if you're at a party or you're wherever and something's going on would you be proud to stand up and be

279
00:20:29.80 --> 00:20:35.000
Hey here was the situation and I this is what I did and this is why I did it if you can't

280
00:20:35.96 --> 00:20:41.56
Maybe you should really reconsider what your actions are gonna be no man. It's because a lot of the time shoots

281
00:20:41.56 --> 00:20:46.20
For she's like kid. That's an adult too. A lot of the time it's like they're literally the opposite decision

282
00:20:46.68 --> 00:20:47.32
You're like

283
00:20:47.32 --> 00:20:52.12
Especially if it's one of those like go along with the crowd kind of scenarios, you know where's like all that? It's easy to go along there and

284
00:20:52.36 --> 00:20:56.44
When your kids especially when they involve drinking and stuff sometimes there's really no consequence

285
00:20:56.44 --> 00:20:59.72
You know whatever you did something dumb no one gets the herder dies or nothing like that

286
00:20:59.72 --> 00:21:04.12
But everyone's in a while there is but so it's like it makes it harder because you don't

287
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.04
Like when you go do something. I don't know dumb. I don't know good jump off or preach

288
00:21:08.04 --> 00:21:13.56
I don't know something drinking drive or whatever and no one dies or no one nothing big happens

289
00:21:13.56 --> 00:21:19.88
It's sort of reinforces that maybe it might be okay, you know you maybe be able to slide with this behavior a little bit, you know

290
00:21:20.28 --> 00:21:26.04
But at the end of the day, you know, yeah if you can clearly see that big picture where in the future

291
00:21:26.04 --> 00:21:28.28
You're gonna be looking back on how you handled it. Yeah

292
00:21:28.84 --> 00:21:31.80
Here's another thing same concept I used to tell I told my guys

293
00:21:32.44 --> 00:21:37.40
Was you just might as well act like CNN is recording what you're doing in it. Yeah

294
00:21:39.16 --> 00:21:43.32
Right, so if you want to act like an idiot guess what it's gonna be on CNN because someone's got a camera

295
00:21:43.32 --> 00:21:48.12
Somewhere around there and you might as well be saying that today as a kid as a teenager

296
00:21:48.12 --> 00:21:51.88
Yeah, you might as well be saying yep, this is this is the next viral video

297
00:21:51.88 --> 00:21:56.68
This is my 15 minutes of fame is gonna be me doing whatever I'm doing right here

298
00:21:57.24 --> 00:22:00.92
Yeah, yeah, so gotta watch out for that learn from hack

299
00:22:02.68 --> 00:22:09.40
Next question. Docko. I start with receiving banter from other guys banter. Okay. I'm naturally a sensitive gut

300
00:22:09.40 --> 00:22:15.40
Which lens myself to take normal smack talk from other guys personally? I'm trying to get after it

301
00:22:15.40 --> 00:22:21.80
I wake up earlier work out eat healthy work pretty hard, but still seemed to have some deep seated insecurities

302
00:22:21.88 --> 00:22:25.96
Which flare up when guys give me stick. I have some bloody good mates

303
00:22:27.32 --> 00:22:34.52
And I want to get to the point where I can take smack talk for what it is and even give a bit of stick back to the guys

304
00:22:34.52 --> 00:22:37.48
What can I do to help this?

305
00:22:39.16 --> 00:22:41.48
Here's one thing that you can try

306
00:22:43.16 --> 00:22:48.92
To get into your brain and this is one of those things that's hard to get into your brain

307
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:56.44
And it's even harder to actually get it in your brain and functionally use this thought here's the thought

308
00:22:56.44 --> 00:23:06.04
The more okay if you're if you're paranoid about something if you're insecure about something

309
00:23:06.60 --> 00:23:12.52
the more you let things bother you the more insecure you will appear

310
00:23:14.28 --> 00:23:20.68
Let me say that again the more you let things bother you the more insecure you're going to appear

311
00:23:20.68 --> 00:23:25.32
And the worse whatever that thing that you're worried about whatever that thing that makes you feel as a

312
00:23:25.32 --> 00:23:27.88
Curse it's going to appear to everyone else

313
00:23:29.48 --> 00:23:37.000
So if you got a big nose and you're embarrassed because you got a big nose and every time someone says something about your big nose

314
00:23:37.48 --> 00:23:43.20
You get mad and you get offended that big nose is be closed even bigger

315
00:23:45.48 --> 00:23:50.88
So think about that if there's something that bothers you and you let it be known and

316
00:23:50.88 --> 00:23:55.04
You let it bother you the worse it's going to get and

317
00:23:56.08 --> 00:24:00.96
And also think about this another thing that will help these are things I'm trying to help

318
00:24:01.68 --> 00:24:02.68
help

319
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:03.68
Sort of

320
00:24:03.68 --> 00:24:10.80
Smooth the edges of insecurity. Here's another one people even though you think even they think they are and it's kind of ego-tistical to think this

321
00:24:10.80 --> 00:24:14.84
But we all do it people aren't sitting around and thinking about you in your weaknesses

322
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:23.000
You're not sitting around and thinking about you in your weaknesses. They're not like that's your ego telling you that

323
00:24:23.84 --> 00:24:25.84
so

324
00:24:25.96 --> 00:24:30.24
Don't sit there and think everyone's looking at your big nose all the time. They don't care

325
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:34.48
They got their other problems. They got their own life going on. They don't care about your big nose

326
00:24:35.20 --> 00:24:39.48
You know what makes them care about it when they know if they say something you it bothers you

327
00:24:39.48 --> 00:24:44.80
Yeah, that's the first thing I'm gonna think when they see you again. Oh, here comes the good time some fun

328
00:24:44.80 --> 00:24:49.000
Yeah, and here's another thing if you want to kind of mitigate that

329
00:24:49.84 --> 00:24:56.000
Man, do what I do it Mark doesn't weigh the warrior kid when Uncle Jax says hey if you're getting made fun of

330
00:24:56.28 --> 00:25:02.12
He's in a way the work you call and plate face. Yeah same Mark. Oh, you got around this guy Nathan James to tell him

331
00:25:02.12 --> 00:25:05.52
Mark oh, you got around face you look like plate calls and plate face. That's his insult

332
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:09.52
That's insults him all the time and it bothers him. He's looking in the mirror going

333
00:25:11.84 --> 00:25:17.32
Let's it bother and Uncle Jax has hate go go make fun of yourself and he finally gets a chance

334
00:25:17.32 --> 00:25:24.12
He does a they're in a class and they have to do a self portrait and he draws himself as a plate a plate face and

335
00:25:25.44 --> 00:25:28.24
When the kid that's been making fun of it season he laughs and then

336
00:25:28.80 --> 00:25:35.26
Guess what does make fun of him anymore about it because he realizes it doesn't bother and they kind of pond a little and they kind of mumbles

337
00:25:35.26 --> 00:25:41.82
Actually what he's going for in this question that is yeah, yeah, so you got him and it's it's this

338
00:25:41.82 --> 00:25:45.34
What that's why I said it's hard to do this because when you're insecure about your big nose

339
00:25:45.34 --> 00:25:51.78
You're insecure about your big ears or whatever and you let people know that or I mean you just think it's in your brain

340
00:25:51.78 --> 00:25:53.94
You think if you say something that's gonna even worse

341
00:25:53.94 --> 00:25:58.14
They won't get worse. Yeah, might get worse for an uptick for a second, right? It might

342
00:25:58.62 --> 00:26:01.90
You make fun of yourself. You know people like oh, yeah, that's right. You notice that you do it

343
00:26:01.90 --> 00:26:05.68
Yeah, they need it'll kind of no one really cares and that's why in the teams

344
00:26:06.32 --> 00:26:10.16
In the teams you never let anyone know that something bothers you

345
00:26:10.80 --> 00:26:14.16
Or if they know it bothers you you're gonna hear about it forever

346
00:26:14.16 --> 00:26:17.70
That's just gonna be how that's the way it's gonna be and

347
00:26:18.06 --> 00:26:23.58
What that means the polar opposite of that or the flip side of that is it's not fun to harass some

348
00:26:24.02 --> 00:26:28.50
It's not fun to harass someone about something that doesn't bother them. It's not even fun

349
00:26:28.50 --> 00:26:32.38
Right, it's not fun. Why would you harass someone when they don't get it?

350
00:26:32.38 --> 00:26:37.42
You don't even get a rise out of them. It's not fun. You just leave that thing you look for something else

351
00:26:38.34 --> 00:26:39.84
So

352
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:45.30
Poke a little fun at yourself. These guys are gonna back off because they're bored if you show no reaction and

353
00:26:46.18 --> 00:26:51.24
Like you said that that kind of self deprecating humor will form a little bond

354
00:26:51.24 --> 00:26:56.54
Yeah, you can give a little stick back to the guys if you start giving stick to guys be ready to take it back though

355
00:26:56.54 --> 00:27:03.22
Yeah, and then escalate yeah, and then that's just so I mean I grew up with two brothers

356
00:27:04.46 --> 00:27:08.18
One twin brother and that's like like that's

357
00:27:08.66 --> 00:27:13.22
Literally the foundation of our relationship. This is just you tease the other guy about something

358
00:27:13.94 --> 00:27:17.90
Everything like you he can come in with a new shirt on that's a seal button

359
00:27:17.90 --> 00:27:23.58
Yeah, like every the oh will be like oh sure at all, you know like press not even something it's

360
00:27:23.58 --> 00:27:27.62
Something they sell men shirts where you bought that yeah, or yeah, whatever it's

361
00:27:27.62 --> 00:27:31.56
There that's it's so bad to the point where one

362
00:27:32.06 --> 00:27:38.34
When when I got with my current life from where we started dating whatever like it's just having you know

363
00:27:38.34 --> 00:27:42.86
Like even you like same thing, you know like you'll you'll give me crap. I'll give you kind of whatever

364
00:27:43.18 --> 00:27:46.94
But it's so common that I do it to her oh yeah, and

365
00:27:47.94 --> 00:27:53.42
You know at first he's like oh what like what why are you teasing me so much like you're it cuz I knew where you've been before

366
00:27:53.42 --> 00:27:58.54
We're together. I knew her for years actually and he's like kind of annoying. You know, he's like teases or whatever

367
00:27:59.26 --> 00:28:01.26
And I had this like

368
00:28:01.82 --> 00:28:07.38
Relate myself and check yeah because that because that is so so much of how guys do it

369
00:28:07.38 --> 00:28:12.78
You know a hundred percent right. I told this story before when I got when I was going to college and Western around team guys all day

370
00:28:12.78 --> 00:28:14.78
And I started doing the team guy thing with my wife

371
00:28:16.38 --> 00:28:18.88
Yeah, she's like hey I'm not in the teams

372
00:28:19.66 --> 00:28:22.78
So you can be quiet now and I was like wow

373
00:28:22.78 --> 00:28:26.06
She's right and I didn't even realize it cuz that's just you know all day long

374
00:28:26.06 --> 00:28:30.78
You show up in theatoon space and it's verbal sparring yes, as soon as you walk through the door

375
00:28:30.78 --> 00:28:36.30
It's only he's gonna say something. Yeah, yeah, you're gonna bring it and what's interesting is how he's how he's like

376
00:28:36.30 --> 00:28:40.70
I want to get to the point where you know he can back to what I think it's I would agree with this

377
00:28:40.70 --> 00:28:44.26
I'll probably even hundred ten percent which is hard to agree a hundred percent

378
00:28:44.26 --> 00:28:47.82
But I feel this way it's probably stronger than him like

379
00:28:47.82 --> 00:28:52.46
You ever been around someone who like you just can't really joke around with like yeah

380
00:28:52.46 --> 00:28:55.90
I'm not the guy who all tease someone and try to like make them

381
00:28:56.54 --> 00:29:02.14
You know, especially if I don't know good or whatever, but um, but if you're around someone who like can't really take it

382
00:29:02.14 --> 00:29:05.50
You can't joke around with them. It's like man. I don't want that guy to be there man

383
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:07.18
I wish he just wasn't you know

384
00:29:07.18 --> 00:29:09.82
I'm not mad at him, but I just I don't want to hang around with that guy

385
00:29:09.98 --> 00:29:15.82
You don't want to be that guy. No, so I even if like a special first like let's say okay

386
00:29:15.82 --> 00:29:19.98
I'm this guy right here the worst is someone that can dish it out but can't take it yeah

387
00:29:19.98 --> 00:29:24.86
But yeah, that is the worst. It's I don't I would the only reason I wouldn't say he's the worst is

388
00:29:24.86 --> 00:29:30.22
What's worse if he's dishing it out and he can't take it? It's kind of you get a payoff of teasing the guy

389
00:29:30.62 --> 00:29:33.90
I'm saying true. It let's say he doesn't dish it up. Let's say he's just a guy

390
00:29:33.90 --> 00:29:37.10
You just can't joke around with this like man. You're making me uncomfortable kind of thing

391
00:29:37.10 --> 00:29:38.70
You know, but if this guy because you

392
00:29:38.70 --> 00:29:42.22
It's your point if it's yeah, if you load is annoying when people can't take it

393
00:29:42.22 --> 00:29:46.54
And you make a joke and they get all fired up and they're like actually mad

394
00:29:47.10 --> 00:29:50.62
Yeah, that is annoying. That's what that's how you end up with people that aren't really your friends

395
00:29:50.62 --> 00:29:55.50
Oh, really different exactly right so but yes, yes, so get their man

396
00:29:55.50 --> 00:30:00.30
I actually get there and at first just and you kind of made it really clear to me

397
00:30:00.86 --> 00:30:04.22
How you know when you make a change something it's not gonna woo boom your

398
00:30:04.22 --> 00:30:06.66
For reasons with the change going full speed, you know

399
00:30:06.86 --> 00:30:08.86
What do you say low drag?

400
00:30:08.86 --> 00:30:10.86
High speed low drag

401
00:30:10.86 --> 00:30:14.78
It's not gonna be like that right at first especially with this kind of stuff if you if you already know you're insecure

402
00:30:15.02 --> 00:30:18.78
Yeah, which is a big step ahead by the way some people there are I'm not insecure

403
00:30:19.02 --> 00:30:21.74
I mean while they're either you're making it they know it but they just don't make it

404
00:30:21.74 --> 00:30:26.70
Yeah, so this guy, you know, so but you're gonna feel it man when they call you big you know

405
00:30:26.70 --> 00:30:28.22
Whatever they're calling you whatever

406
00:30:28.22 --> 00:30:32.78
You're gonna sort of feel it on the inside still but just don't behave you know in a way

407
00:30:33.26 --> 00:30:37.26
Just like I don't know. I don't know what to do there's plenty of things to do but yeah, man

408
00:30:37.26 --> 00:30:39.26
You do want to get there 100%

409
00:30:39.26 --> 00:30:41.26
Yeah check

410
00:30:41.26 --> 00:30:42.46
Next question. I'm a

411
00:30:44.86 --> 00:30:46.06
Jock

412
00:30:46.06 --> 00:30:50.86
Number three, sorry. How do you deal with ultimatums from customers bosses?

413
00:30:50.86 --> 00:30:52.06
It's set true

414
00:30:52.70 --> 00:30:56.46
That are unrealistic due to the nature of the situation and the ultimatum

415
00:30:58.94 --> 00:31:02.86
What I'm gonna do with ultimatums is I am going to tell the truth

416
00:31:04.78 --> 00:31:06.78
about the situation two them

417
00:31:06.78 --> 00:31:08.78
But first

418
00:31:08.78 --> 00:31:12.78
I'm gonna tell the truth about the situation to myself

419
00:31:14.06 --> 00:31:15.26
Because

420
00:31:15.26 --> 00:31:21.26
You gotta look at the situation inside yourself is this truly unattainable like truly unattainable

421
00:31:22.14 --> 00:31:23.50
And and sometimes

422
00:31:23.50 --> 00:31:28.38
Even though it seems truly unattainable but then when you actually think about it you realize oh I could attain this

423
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:34.38
I can make this happen. I'm gonna have to sacrifice whatever to make it happen. I'm gonna have to

424
00:31:34.38 --> 00:31:36.38
To to

425
00:31:36.38 --> 00:31:43.34
It's gonna cost me or the team or the company something in order to make it happen like oh you want that done

426
00:31:43.90 --> 00:31:48.94
You want that you want that project done by you know the 15th cool we'll get it done

427
00:31:49.66 --> 00:31:52.78
But here's what we're not gonna be able to do or here's what I'm not gonna be able to do

428
00:31:54.06 --> 00:31:57.02
And I'm also gonna make sure that I

429
00:31:58.14 --> 00:31:59.82
Pressure test

430
00:31:59.82 --> 00:32:05.90
The ultimatum against me giving the absolute full measure of effort

431
00:32:06.78 --> 00:32:08.78
Right like wow if I go

432
00:32:09.98 --> 00:32:16.46
110% right not even on a person beyond you're gonna give everything you can is it achievable

433
00:32:16.86 --> 00:32:19.98
Because a lot of times people will do it's an ultimatum can't make it well as a

434
00:32:21.58 --> 00:32:22.86
Member of a team I

435
00:32:23.02 --> 00:32:25.02
Want people's attitude to be like you know what?

436
00:32:25.02 --> 00:32:30.78
We're gonna do it. We're gonna get it done no one else be able to do this, but we're gonna do it watch

437
00:32:31.90 --> 00:32:35.18
That's I like saying that sometimes watch watch

438
00:32:36.86 --> 00:32:38.86
I used to say watch me work

439
00:32:38.86 --> 00:32:40.86
Yeah, I forgot it from some

440
00:32:41.02 --> 00:32:42.22
Ali

441
00:32:42.22 --> 00:32:44.22
So then okay, so now you truly

442
00:32:44.70 --> 00:32:48.38
You tell yourself the truth about the situation you figure out

443
00:32:49.26 --> 00:32:53.50
That there's truly under no circumstances that this is possible

444
00:32:53.50 --> 00:33:00.06
Then it's my time to tell them the truth which is like listen and I'll get my data together I'll get my information together

445
00:33:00.06 --> 00:33:02.06
I'll explain to them

446
00:33:03.18 --> 00:33:09.82
What you know what why I can't I'm not gonna be able to physically get this done it's just physically not possible

447
00:33:11.02 --> 00:33:13.02
and then

448
00:33:13.02 --> 00:33:18.14
You know what the short falls are gonna be now and once I explain that to him if they're if they're completely unwavering

449
00:33:18.14 --> 00:33:22.62
Because if you explain everything and you put your data together and you say look the bottom line is to do

450
00:33:22.62 --> 00:33:27.42
To to assemble this many pieces by our best two people on the team

451
00:33:27.42 --> 00:33:34.22
It takes them an hour each and you want us to assemble 14 of them in three hours. It is not possible for us to do that

452
00:33:35.90 --> 00:33:39.66
And even if you gave me more people it doesn't matter they don't how to do that so it can't be done

453
00:33:39.66 --> 00:33:44.06
I need at least whatever six hours with those whatever whatever it is

454
00:33:45.66 --> 00:33:47.66
If they're unwilling

455
00:33:47.66 --> 00:33:54.78
To to waver on the ultimate them at all like no go you need to get it done you need to get done. Well, I want them to do okay

456
00:33:54.78 --> 00:33:58.38
I'm gonna try my hardest I'm gonna buckle down. I'm gonna do my best

457
00:33:59.58 --> 00:34:03.26
I'm gonna see how much how close I can get to achieving the goal

458
00:34:03.26 --> 00:34:06.14
I'm gonna have fun. I'm gonna go so hard

459
00:34:06.86 --> 00:34:11.98
That it's gonna get nuts like we're gonna get it done and then

460
00:34:12.94 --> 00:34:15.50
when if we fall short

461
00:34:15.50 --> 00:34:21.42
Which we will because I figured out there's no physical humanly possible way to make this happen

462
00:34:21.50 --> 00:34:25.02
Then what I'm gonna do is I will go to them and I'll explain

463
00:34:25.82 --> 00:34:30.62
The things that I am going to do differently next time in order to meet their goals right?

464
00:34:30.62 --> 00:34:32.62
I'm gonna say listen, you know what I

465
00:34:33.34 --> 00:34:37.82
I should have asked you earlier if this was a possible thing and I should have had a

466
00:34:38.14 --> 00:34:42.22
Back-up plan so here's what I'm putting into place now to make sure this does not happen again or hey

467
00:34:42.22 --> 00:34:49.58
I am going to need more manpower so that if we run into this again, I've got the people it's my fault for not staffing us up correctly or

468
00:34:50.62 --> 00:34:55.66
I need to pay more attention to what's happening in the future so that I can have a better

469
00:34:55.90 --> 00:35:01.98
Aware I have better awareness of when this type of situation will unfold so I can have my team prepared for it

470
00:35:02.70 --> 00:35:03.66
or

471
00:35:03.66 --> 00:35:09.34
these complexities that happened I didn't explain to them. I didn't explain them to you well enough and so

472
00:35:09.34 --> 00:35:14.86
If you understood if I do a better job of making you understand the difficulties of making this happen

473
00:35:15.42 --> 00:35:18.78
Hopefully you'll realize that there's that's more time is needed

474
00:35:19.02 --> 00:35:24.06
So I'm not gonna go in there and throw up my arms and see I told you so you were stupid

475
00:35:24.62 --> 00:35:28.46
I was right because then that's just sabotage to now they don't believe you anyways

476
00:35:28.86 --> 00:35:34.38
Yeah, now when you say we couldn't get it done see like I told you I told you we need more time and they're like yeah, of course

477
00:35:34.38 --> 00:35:38.14
You you know you you went into it think you're gonna fail and guess what the self-fulfilling

478
00:35:38.14 --> 00:35:42.30
Prophecy good job it good job you proved yourself to be right loser

479
00:35:43.58 --> 00:35:45.58
Demoted

480
00:35:46.94 --> 00:35:53.02
And that's what I do up and down the chain by the way, you know ultimatum's can come up and down the chain a command

481
00:35:55.02 --> 00:35:57.02
Hold the line do your best

482
00:35:57.02 --> 00:35:59.02
That's what you do

483
00:35:59.02 --> 00:36:02.38
That seems and tell the truth them. It all starts with telling the truth to yourself

484
00:36:03.18 --> 00:36:05.82
Yeah, and then to your people that you're trying to costumer

485
00:36:05.82 --> 00:36:11.58
Yeah, you know client. I want this foundation poured by such and such a date. Hey week

486
00:36:13.10 --> 00:36:15.90
We will do our best here's the shortfalls you know whatever

487
00:36:16.54 --> 00:36:19.50
That's the way it is yeah, and that's a big one here like where

488
00:36:20.86 --> 00:36:25.66
Kind of learn this from you where it's because you can

489
00:36:26.54 --> 00:36:32.78
Like to tell you like oh hey I can't this can't be done like you kind of you get to the point in your mind where like

490
00:36:32.78 --> 00:36:40.14
We both know it can be done, but I was just you know given my current rescuing sleep schedule and

491
00:36:40.94 --> 00:36:46.06
You know I got this chill. I like to watch it. Right? You know it's like that kind of situation

492
00:36:46.06 --> 00:36:48.78
I want to mess that

493
00:36:48.78 --> 00:36:54.46
Exactly, so it kind of shapes up to be like that you know where it's like for sure

494
00:36:54.70 --> 00:37:00.62
We both know and I don't know you know like if there's a box who's like just grinding someone into the ground

495
00:37:00.62 --> 00:37:05.18
Okay, that's a whole different scenario, but yeah at the end of the day like if you're truthful and it's like hey

496
00:37:05.18 --> 00:37:11.82
Get this done or you're fired kind of thing and then you start with a truth that you say it be like can I get it done and then you really think

497
00:37:11.82 --> 00:37:16.38
Let's say like you were gonna die or I don't know you could get it done a lot of the time

498
00:37:16.38 --> 00:37:18.38
I'm not saying all the time of course of course

499
00:37:18.54 --> 00:37:23.26
The amount of times in my naval career. Let's call it when I was in the navy that guys

500
00:37:23.90 --> 00:37:28.86
Said to me like we can't do it. I can't remember times like guys guys just be like

501
00:37:28.86 --> 00:37:30.86
Like

502
00:37:33.34 --> 00:37:36.38
They wouldn't be like well, I don't know jacco. I be like hey, look

503
00:37:36.38 --> 00:37:39.66
There's what we got to get done. I think we can do it and they'd be like

504
00:37:41.82 --> 00:37:43.82
Yep

505
00:37:43.82 --> 00:37:47.26
Because we're about to go get some but yeah, and you know obviously

506
00:37:47.66 --> 00:37:52.06
Situation some situations are more like more serious, you know like you're not gonna

507
00:37:52.86 --> 00:37:54.86
I don't know

508
00:37:54.86 --> 00:37:57.50
But yeah, that telling the truth thing tell the truth

509
00:37:57.50 --> 00:38:02.78
Yeah, I do speak from a position of luxury where I have the truth reflected at me

510
00:38:02.78 --> 00:38:08.06
Pretty accurately on a pretty regular basis, so I'm not saying it's that easy to tell the truth

511
00:38:08.06 --> 00:38:11.82
But if you just try hard try genuine you got to be genuine right genuinely

512
00:38:12.30 --> 00:38:15.10
be like yes, this is true about myself

513
00:38:16.46 --> 00:38:18.46
Check

514
00:38:18.46 --> 00:38:19.26
Next question

515
00:38:19.26 --> 00:38:22.06
Question from the next podcast is your wife discipline

516
00:38:23.02 --> 00:38:25.90
How do you navigate a potential mismatch between you two?

517
00:38:25.90 --> 00:38:28.38
What about when family non

518
00:38:29.02 --> 00:38:32.54
Discipline cost you an expect time and energy taking from your goals

519
00:38:33.58 --> 00:38:40.86
Family non discipline what like my family's not being discipline. Yeah, not unbored. Yeah, they're not on board with the program my wife

520
00:38:41.50 --> 00:38:48.22
Is she runs a tight ship and is disciplined in a little bit of a different wave in me

521
00:38:49.74 --> 00:38:51.74
Then she's not the same as me and

522
00:38:51.74 --> 00:38:55.90
And if that were to cause

523
00:38:56.94 --> 00:38:58.94
Some kind of a conflict between us

524
00:38:59.74 --> 00:39:01.90
Well, then that's my fault for not

525
00:39:02.62 --> 00:39:04.30
communicating with her and

526
00:39:04.94 --> 00:39:08.94
Allowing her to understand my perspective and understanding her perspective

527
00:39:10.22 --> 00:39:11.90
So

528
00:39:12.06 --> 00:39:18.30
For instance, what it was the situation right? Oh my wife wants me, you know, she wants to spend time with me in the morning whatever

529
00:39:18.30 --> 00:39:20.30
Right, what do you wake up early and work out?

530
00:39:20.30 --> 00:39:23.82
Before she's awake you are coming out. Is not her fault

531
00:39:24.70 --> 00:39:26.70
It's not her fault. It's my fault

532
00:39:27.74 --> 00:39:33.02
Well, what about when oh I really want to eat dinner with you at night. Okay, cool. I'll eat dinner with you

533
00:39:33.50 --> 00:39:35.98
And I'll stay up later at night so that I can get my work done

534
00:39:36.78 --> 00:39:38.78
And that's fine. You go to bed

535
00:39:38.78 --> 00:39:43.90
That's not that's not that's not my response that that's not your responsibility that's my responsibility

536
00:39:43.90 --> 00:39:54.38
It's not your responsibility to mold your life around my whole life, right? That's not that's that's not the way it is and by the way when the

537
00:39:55.10 --> 00:39:56.70
family

538
00:39:56.94 --> 00:39:58.46
Is

539
00:39:58.62 --> 00:40:04.70
Doing something that is taking away what does he say my energy taking away my energy and taking away my time

540
00:40:04.78 --> 00:40:10.38
Then I fix that problem and when I say that I fix the problem. I don't mean I fix them

541
00:40:10.38 --> 00:40:17.10
Yeah, I don't mean that I impose my discipline on them

542
00:40:18.22 --> 00:40:21.98
I might involve some adjustments or some attempts to get adjustments

543
00:40:23.18 --> 00:40:25.18
But I'm not

544
00:40:25.74 --> 00:40:31.10
But this really simple. I don't blame up my family when things don't go right

545
00:40:34.30 --> 00:40:36.70
I couldn't work out today because my kid was sick

546
00:40:36.70 --> 00:40:41.42
My daughter spilled the milk and I was like hey

547
00:40:42.14 --> 00:40:51.18
That's the same. This is just about ownership like if you just want to blame your family when you're weak or you make a mistake or you didn't organize or you didn't explain to people correctly

548
00:40:52.54 --> 00:40:56.94
Then that's the way it is I can say this to your family is not you

549
00:40:59.50 --> 00:41:02.62
Your family is not you they are on

550
00:41:02.62 --> 00:41:07.98
Your program that's not there that's not their deal

551
00:41:08.86 --> 00:41:10.54
Hey, if they're on it great that's cool

552
00:41:11.58 --> 00:41:13.90
My family's not all on my program

553
00:41:15.74 --> 00:41:17.74
That's not the way it works

554
00:41:18.30 --> 00:41:20.46
In pose oh that's fun

555
00:41:21.58 --> 00:41:26.94
The what's the where's that could you you want to you want to impose your program on everyone in your family

556
00:41:27.34 --> 00:41:28.70
What are they going to do?

557
00:41:28.70 --> 00:41:35.02
What it's the same thing happens with any team if you start imposing your strict discipline on them

558
00:41:35.42 --> 00:41:37.58
Cool you can get them to do what you want to do at that moment

559
00:41:38.06 --> 00:41:41.26
Guess what they do as soon as they get the opportunity to rebel against you they rebel

560
00:41:41.98 --> 00:41:48.78
You get a mutiny you get a kid that's rebellious beyond the norm that's doing thing that's actually gonna

561
00:41:49.34 --> 00:41:51.34
Gonna really reject you

562
00:41:51.34 --> 00:41:53.02
so

563
00:41:53.02 --> 00:41:55.74
You got a you don't blame your family

564
00:41:55.74 --> 00:41:58.94
Fix the problem. Do you know who you have control over you?

565
00:41:58.94 --> 00:42:05.42
You know control you don't have control over your nine-year-old kid you might think you do but you don't you got to make you know control over your wife

566
00:42:06.62 --> 00:42:09.58
To just make her you know get in the game. Oh

567
00:42:10.62 --> 00:42:13.74
You want to you want to stay on the program you want to cook

568
00:42:14.70 --> 00:42:21.58
Uh whatever 14 chicken breasts on a Sunday night so you got two a day during the week honey make it happen

569
00:42:21.58 --> 00:42:23.58
No honey make that happen

570
00:42:25.74 --> 00:42:31.66
If you are a good leader and you explain what your goals are and you get her on board with the program

571
00:42:32.30 --> 00:42:37.50
Then yeah guess what she's doing on Sunday night help and you cook some chicken breast for the week

572
00:42:37.90 --> 00:42:45.02
Yeah, but this is just like anything else man. This is just like any other leader's situation. You want to blame the team when something's going wrong

573
00:42:45.98 --> 00:42:48.30
That's not gonna get you a solution

574
00:42:48.30 --> 00:42:52.94
You need to take ownership of the problem you need to get the problem solved and when I say get the problem solved

575
00:42:54.06 --> 00:43:01.82
You this doesn't mean impose your will on the team that means you need to lead the team and there's a big difference

576
00:43:03.26 --> 00:43:05.26
So

577
00:43:05.66 --> 00:43:07.66
Get some yeah

578
00:43:07.66 --> 00:43:18.06
Yeah, can you lean in by the way the better just like anything else just like hack worth the better relationship that you build with your wife and with your kids

579
00:43:18.46 --> 00:43:24.14
Guess what the more flexibility you have the more the way they give you

580
00:43:25.74 --> 00:43:27.10
The worse

581
00:43:27.10 --> 00:43:33.10
Relationship you build with your wife and kids the less flexible and the less leeway and the less chicken breast you're gonna have cook for you

582
00:43:34.70 --> 00:43:36.30
They're not in the game with you

583
00:43:36.30 --> 00:43:38.30
Yeah, so build a relationship

584
00:43:38.30 --> 00:43:42.38
I know that might sound like like oh, we're married so we have relationship

585
00:43:42.38 --> 00:43:44.38
Not necessarily true

586
00:43:44.38 --> 00:43:49.58
Yeah, build a relationship make them understand where you're coming from make them understand what the strategic goals are

587
00:43:49.98 --> 00:43:56.62
Yeah, make them understand just like in the leadership situation make sure they understand how the strategic goals that you're trying to achieve for yourself

588
00:43:56.62 --> 00:44:01.02
Well then come all the way back down and impact them in a positive way because by the way

589
00:44:01.02 --> 00:44:05.74
If you're doing things strategically, it'll help you that are gonna screw over the rest of the team or in this case family

590
00:44:05.74 --> 00:44:12.70
Guess what you're not gonna get support for those goals because they're not helping out the team if you're doing it for yourself and yourself only

591
00:44:12.86 --> 00:44:14.86
That's problematic

592
00:44:16.06 --> 00:44:22.14
So if you're hey, I want to work out. I want to get you know, I want to work out. I want to change you to every day

593
00:44:22.38 --> 00:44:25.02
Okay, well, how do I benefit from that? Yeah honey?

594
00:44:25.02 --> 00:44:28.22
How does it? Yeah, okay? Well, let me tell you how here's my plan

595
00:44:28.86 --> 00:44:31.98
In six years, you know, I'm a purple belt right now in six years

596
00:44:31.98 --> 00:44:37.34
I'm gonna get my black belt and when I get my black belt we're gonna open a school when I open a school guess what we're gonna do all day

597
00:44:37.34 --> 00:44:40.06
We're gonna teach you to get you we're gonna hang out on a gym. We're gonna have a good time

598
00:44:40.06 --> 00:44:43.98
That's the strategic goal. I need you in the game with me right now. That's totally different

599
00:44:44.22 --> 00:44:46.22
Then I want to trade

600
00:44:46.22 --> 00:44:50.86
Yeah, I'm a man. Yeah, don't keep me from this. Yeah, yeah, and that's

601
00:44:52.78 --> 00:44:56.86
Depending on who you're obviously, but I would even say that's even speaking from my own experience

602
00:44:56.86 --> 00:45:03.34
That's even over saying it really like let's say you take jiu-jitsu or working out of whatever

603
00:45:03.34 --> 00:45:07.58
Yeah, yeah, you know like to you know to do that, but I get I get the example for sure

604
00:45:07.58 --> 00:45:13.74
You're gonna see something much more simple like hey easier way more babe just say hey this this part of my life

605
00:45:13.74 --> 00:45:17.50
Even if it's new it's new. I know our families chaotic. You need my help with the kids and then

606
00:45:18.06 --> 00:45:22.98
Be like but hey this this sort of this means a lot to me and it makes me feel good makes me you know a happy person

607
00:45:22.98 --> 00:45:30.34
Whatever it can mean you can we make this work you know can we do what you know how you like this other thing sure

608
00:45:30.34 --> 00:45:36.58
Yeah, I want to support you doing that here's what I need support right? Yes, this thing puts a smile on my face

609
00:45:36.90 --> 00:45:41.62
You want me smiling around here you that's what and people I'm sure someone's gonna bring up the fact that there were times

610
00:45:42.90 --> 00:45:47.46
When I was in the dirt aims and I would come home for work at 7.30 at night

611
00:45:47.46 --> 00:45:52.02
I'd pick up my gym bag and drop off my my work bag and I just walk

612
00:45:52.02 --> 00:45:55.30
I'd go I'm gonna train and there was a few times

613
00:45:56.26 --> 00:45:59.14
Where she did not want me to go train tears in her eyes

614
00:46:00.02 --> 00:46:04.50
You've got to be kidding me you've been going all week you've been gone for two weeks you come home at

615
00:46:04.50 --> 00:46:07.86
7.30 and you're gonna go train is that a eating dinner with us. That was like yep

616
00:46:10.26 --> 00:46:13.70
That the reason I bring that up because I know someone's gonna bring up that's not good leadership

617
00:46:13.78 --> 00:46:19.38
That's not me being cool. Yeah, that's not me building the relationship. That's me moving in the other direction

618
00:46:19.38 --> 00:46:25.70
Yeah, so that's not what I'm saying to do but if you come home. Hey, look here's the deal here's what's going on

619
00:46:25.70 --> 00:46:31.14
Here's why I you know what I've got a lot of I come home from work. I got a lot of stuff on my brain

620
00:46:32.02 --> 00:46:36.58
I'm in a bad mood when I come home and I don't want to be in a bad mood around you don't

621
00:46:36.58 --> 00:46:42.10
Be a bad mood around the kids. I'm gonna go train for an hour when I come back. I'm gonna have a smile on my face watch

622
00:46:42.10 --> 00:46:51.62
Watch what boom and that's actually my wife eventually told me like oh when you don't train

623
00:46:52.74 --> 00:46:57.70
You're not nice to be around not that I was intentionally going all you could train no, but you just have the

624
00:46:58.90 --> 00:47:00.90
You don't you don't have that release

625
00:47:00.90 --> 00:47:06.58
Yeah, that that is a real thing for sure. I mean it's manageable everyone's different. I think obviously

626
00:47:06.58 --> 00:47:14.50
But I wouldn't you can even say so many even more because that's a hard one to sell sometimes to some people to be like hey

627
00:47:14.50 --> 00:47:20.50
All be happier, you know then there'll be like hmm well or except for that all be happier

628
00:47:21.14 --> 00:47:27.30
Mains will be happier yeah and you got to you're right though. You got to give and take right? You got to say okay

629
00:47:27.30 --> 00:47:32.10
What do you what can I do for you exactly right? That's that's what it is be like hey this means a lot to me, you know

630
00:47:32.10 --> 00:47:39.86
To and usually you know in a relationship like that they care if something means something to your husband or wife or whatever

631
00:47:39.86 --> 00:47:44.96
Like that's not nothing that's something you know look if you if the if your husband and you say this

632
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:46.46
You just it means a lot to me

633
00:47:46.46 --> 00:47:50.34
Therefore you need to sacrifice your whole thing to accommodate it

634
00:47:50.34 --> 00:47:58.46
You can do that, but it's not nothing so you say as a leader you can't have the team sacrifice everything for you

635
00:47:58.46 --> 00:48:02.70
You think yeah, you're gonna do a good job on this mission. I'm gonna get promoted

636
00:48:03.70 --> 00:48:06.06
You know or hey if we do a good job with this product

637
00:48:06.38 --> 00:48:10.42
We're I'm gonna make more money. It's more from my bottom line

638
00:48:10.94 --> 00:48:16.50
For the ability for our shareholders no one cares the front end doesn't care about profitability for the shareholders must understand how it relates back to them

639
00:48:16.50 --> 00:48:20.50
Yeah, so family doesn't care about you trained in jutsu unless they realize how it's gonna

640
00:48:21.02 --> 00:48:24.34
Come back to you so what you do is you tell her like hey just

641
00:48:24.34 --> 00:48:31.30
Can can we make this work and actually whatever however this gets in the way of us you know like whatever like I

642
00:48:31.30 --> 00:48:36.98
Want to just in general make that up to some way you know like what can you what can I do for you like I

643
00:48:36.98 --> 00:48:42.94
Said or what do you want to do something or let's let's do this so we can both kind of have something fun come with me

644
00:48:42.94 --> 00:48:47.62
If you want but hey, I don't don't just automatically expect you to love jutsu like yeah love jutsu

645
00:48:48.34 --> 00:48:51.14
Unfortunately, I'm for sure it goes forever. You know most

646
00:48:51.14 --> 00:48:57.46
It's possible. It's very possible. Yeah, yeah, but I'm saying you know you it's like how you say like make it

647
00:48:57.66 --> 00:49:01.44
Make you gotta accommodate it. You know, so if you're doing like a workout

648
00:49:01.44 --> 00:49:06.50
Let's say it's a year thing right. Okay. Like don't work out. You know and that's my thing whatever

649
00:49:06.50 --> 00:49:11.62
Did you do I think that different cuz working out is like you can kind of do that whenever you know

650
00:49:12.34 --> 00:49:16.90
But jutsu is like if you don't be you got so trained with some people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know

651
00:49:17.18 --> 00:49:19.18
So yeah, man if

652
00:49:19.18 --> 00:49:23.66
And constant communication to by the way, but you know because after a while

653
00:49:24.22 --> 00:49:25.86
It's like how you gonna jutsu again

654
00:49:25.86 --> 00:49:30.08
You're like done the kids kind of need help with the homework and I'm swamp with this other family stuff

655
00:49:30.08 --> 00:49:33.54
You know kind of thing but if you're constantly communicating and then you'll tell you hey

656
00:49:33.54 --> 00:49:36.86
Do you mind not going on this day because of this and you're like hmm okay

657
00:49:36.86 --> 00:49:41.10
Me going this specific day is that more important than the help that they need with the homework

658
00:49:41.10 --> 00:49:45.34
You know and you can accurately kind of navigate your way through your new situation, you know

659
00:49:45.34 --> 00:49:49.42
But yeah, you're gonna keep talking on that one cuz some people they think oh I can go do you did it now?

660
00:49:49.42 --> 00:49:53.10
Yeah, I don't know saying nothing. I'm just rolling out under every circle. You know

661
00:49:53.66 --> 00:50:00.58
Doesn't work like that sometimes don't don't be like me in that situation. Don't be like taco you probably my wife is very understanding

662
00:50:01.14 --> 00:50:02.42
Yeah, so

663
00:50:02.42 --> 00:50:05.50
That's great. Yeah, my wife probably would have murdered me like

664
00:50:06.14 --> 00:50:09.42
Right face. Oh like killed me as a crime

665
00:50:10.22 --> 00:50:11.72
Next question

666
00:50:11.72 --> 00:50:19.36
Would love to hear your thoughts on the dichotomy of honest self expression versus normal face and or passion versus

667
00:50:19.76 --> 00:50:24.44
Discipline if you aren't caught up on all the podcast normal faces a game

668
00:50:24.44 --> 00:50:30.64
I used to play with my kids where they would have to keep an expressionless face or what I called the normal face good game

669
00:50:30.64 --> 00:50:32.92
But I and you I would line up my kids and

670
00:50:33.88 --> 00:50:37.36
They would have to keep that face and then if they changed their expression anyway

671
00:50:37.36 --> 00:50:44.08
I would hit them in the head with a with the inside cardboard roll of a thing of wrapping paper and

672
00:50:44.72 --> 00:50:49.44
Or I had eventually made like foam pieces for it because they were a little bit more durable and

673
00:50:49.84 --> 00:50:51.92
And you could hit really hard and it would not

674
00:50:52.76 --> 00:50:56.32
So anyways, I know it sounds like you should call child services on me

675
00:50:56.32 --> 00:50:59.32
But it's fun game to play because as you hit one kid

676
00:50:59.32 --> 00:51:02.68
It makes the other kids laugh and then you end up hitting them all and everyone's laughing. It's fun

677
00:51:02.80 --> 00:51:05.80
so and there's also a pragmatic

678
00:51:05.80 --> 00:51:10.96
Reason to do it because it teaches people to control their emotions and

679
00:51:11.68 --> 00:51:18.16
There are times there are many times where you have to learn to control your motions and as kids if you learn to control your motions

680
00:51:18.40 --> 00:51:20.64
It's gonna be beneficial for you in many ways

681
00:51:21.48 --> 00:51:24.60
But does that mean that you should keep normal face all the time?

682
00:51:25.52 --> 00:51:28.12
Never show emotions. No, it's not like that at all

683
00:51:28.60 --> 00:51:33.72
There's like everything else. There's a dichotomy that you have to balance if you're kid wins a wrestling match

684
00:51:33.72 --> 00:51:39.24
You should be happy and great smile and yeah, high five, right? That's cool

685
00:51:40.68 --> 00:51:42.68
if you bite

686
00:51:43.72 --> 00:51:45.72
Into a

687
00:51:45.72 --> 00:51:47.72
amazing piece of

688
00:51:48.80 --> 00:51:51.16
Primrib that your wife cooked for you

689
00:51:52.44 --> 00:51:56.52
Then you should raise your fist to the air and say yes

690
00:51:56.52 --> 00:52:03.92
My wife the first time she ever cooked Primrib she she and she's we didn't know this but she has a talent

691
00:52:04.20 --> 00:52:09.56
She knows she cooks dry chicken Primrib she knocks it on the park first time she ever cooked Primrib

692
00:52:10.68 --> 00:52:15.88
And I took my I'd smell the amazing I was like oh, this is I took my first bite

693
00:52:15.88 --> 00:52:21.56
I looked at her and I looked up better and I said I want to re-do our vows for her

694
00:52:21.56 --> 00:52:23.56
I

695
00:52:23.56 --> 00:52:26.88
Renew the vows it would re-do the vows so yes

696
00:52:28.52 --> 00:52:35.48
You know scenarios like that yeah, you want to show your emotions and if you hear something if your team slacks off

697
00:52:37.40 --> 00:52:39.96
And if you fail the mission you fail the task

698
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.44
Of course you're gonna own it, but you might you know you might want to show a little anger about what happened

699
00:52:46.44 --> 00:52:48.44
So everyone knows like oh

700
00:52:48.44 --> 00:52:54.76
Who's chocolate was normally get mad and he's mad and so we really did something bad and you know even though you're playing on yourself

701
00:52:54.76 --> 00:52:56.12
I can't believe I'm like this down

702
00:52:56.12 --> 00:52:58.76
You know what I mean like you show a little bit that people go okay

703
00:53:00.52 --> 00:53:05.28
So there you're gonna show some most you if you get bad and when you get news that that you know

704
00:53:05.28 --> 00:53:09.52
You got a friend that died we know that's you got to let those emotions out. There's all

705
00:53:10.60 --> 00:53:17.48
Kind of situations where emotions are not only acceptable but they're needed and they're required and in fact if you don't have

706
00:53:17.48 --> 00:53:19.48
Emotions in those situations

707
00:53:21.16 --> 00:53:27.04
That's horrible you need to have them not only as a person as a human being you need to let out your emotions on times

708
00:53:27.36 --> 00:53:29.36
But as a leader

709
00:53:29.36 --> 00:53:32.36
If you don't show any emotions at all

710
00:53:32.92 --> 00:53:38.36
No one's gonna follow you. There's no connection between you and the people on your team

711
00:53:39.08 --> 00:53:43.48
And if you ever if you just sit there and think about people that you've worked for that didn't show emotions

712
00:53:43.48 --> 00:53:48.12
You had no connection with them. You don't care about them. You'll leave you won't go the extra mile to get the job done

713
00:53:49.64 --> 00:53:55.44
So you have to show emotions but of course there are many times in life in the world

714
00:53:55.44 --> 00:54:00.12
Where showing your emotions are gonna have a negative impact on your situation your

715
00:54:01.04 --> 00:54:03.04
You you give up the take down

716
00:54:03.04 --> 00:54:09.32
And you just do competition and you show it in your face that person just thinks that's

717
00:54:09.32 --> 00:54:14.96
Procue right you're a show any emotion there boss tells you you're getting stuck with the underperforming team

718
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.68
Show any emotion right don't don't don't

719
00:54:22.12 --> 00:54:27.80
Don't do that but hey what about this? There's a good one bosses giving you feedback that you don't agree with

720
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:31.96
Roll your eyes

721
00:54:31.96 --> 00:54:39.40
Mean the heavy side the clenched teeth as you're trying to listen with this person you can even respect him. He's telling you what's that gonna get you?

722
00:54:40.60 --> 00:54:43.92
Not gonna get you anything that's showing that negative emotion there

723
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:48.60
You need to keep normal face in that situation your kids doing something that's annoying is trying to test your patience

724
00:54:48.60 --> 00:54:53.24
And they're just trying to piss you off don't let him keep it in check

725
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.80
Get told to go to the other line in DMV

726
00:54:59.80 --> 00:55:05.000
After you've been waiting for an hour and one don't freak out don't show any emotions got it

727
00:55:06.84 --> 00:55:11.08
Here's here's another one we already talked about this one your friends are poking front of you

728
00:55:12.16 --> 00:55:17.000
Because you missed a shot at the range or you got lost on a land navigation course or whatever

729
00:55:17.92 --> 00:55:19.92
Look at all mad

730
00:55:19.92 --> 00:55:21.92
Don't get frustrated don't show any motion

731
00:55:21.92 --> 00:55:28.68
You know they make fun of your haircut they make fun of your accent they make fun of whatever don't show emotions don't freak out

732
00:55:32.16 --> 00:55:35.92
That's the other balance now they're also times

733
00:55:36.68 --> 00:55:44.000
Where you might have to force yourself to show some emotion just to get the point across right your kid hasn't listened you after five or six violations

734
00:55:45.72 --> 00:55:50.000
You might have to show some anger or they do something that's gonna get him hurt right

735
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.04
You got to show some emotion so that they realize that was real

736
00:55:54.56 --> 00:55:59.72
But flying off the temper and flying off the handle and losing your temper is almost never does you any good

737
00:55:59.72 --> 00:56:04.80
So yeah, you have to be balanced in order to be balanced you have to be in control and in order being control

738
00:56:04.80 --> 00:56:11.56
You have to detach from your emotions so control your emotions and not let your emotions control you

739
00:56:13.20 --> 00:56:16.08
I think we already talked about this one part before we're like

740
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:21.84
You know like with your kids or whatever and you're you fly off the handle not fly off the handle

741
00:56:21.84 --> 00:56:27.36
But you you show emotion you raise your voice and yell at him because this one is important this less than that

742
00:56:27.36 --> 00:56:29.36
I'm teaching you obviously didn't get it before what it

743
00:56:30.40 --> 00:56:34.56
Here thing you can't do that every single time you know every single lesson like okay

744
00:56:34.56 --> 00:56:38.48
Oh, it was effective when it raised my voice. Let me just raise my voice now right logically

745
00:56:38.48 --> 00:56:42.08
Let me if that if that is what induces their compliance

746
00:56:42.08 --> 00:56:47.20
Let me just do that right doesn't work that way because after all I like all birds all just don't noise

747
00:56:47.20 --> 00:56:51.12
Yeah, no, so yeah, you got to be like no face. Yeah, yeah

748
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:55.96
Or yeah, just be like normal face normal face normal face everything, you know

749
00:56:56.52 --> 00:57:00.16
And then like the one time you use it. It's like the what do you call the

750
00:57:00.64 --> 00:57:04.12
There's this video game. You used to play it's like you could just put the button

751
00:57:05.52 --> 00:57:07.52
You blow up everybody

752
00:57:07.52 --> 00:57:12.88
Anyway long story, but yeah, don't use it all the time is what I'm saying just use it like sparingly

753
00:57:12.88 --> 00:57:14.88
You're saying yeah judiciously

754
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:17.44
Cool, let's get how do you know what you're saying?

755
00:57:18.56 --> 00:57:20.56
Next question. I'm in college

756
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:26.96
And I'm working towards going to OCS after I graduate I work a food service job

757
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:32.72
I was trying to teach a 17 year old at work why she shouldn't have fast cleaning a fryer

758
00:57:32.72 --> 00:57:39.36
I said because of unmedicated daily discipline in all things that includes cleaning the fire

759
00:57:42.96 --> 00:57:49.28
She still didn't quite get it. I didn't say to her that I make the I make the fryer spotless because if I

760
00:57:49.84 --> 00:57:54.000
Can't manage to clean the fire how can I expect myself to lead people in the military?

761
00:57:54.80 --> 00:57:56.80
It's so facto war

762
00:57:58.16 --> 00:58:00.16
Because I didn't think that

763
00:58:00.16 --> 00:58:01.44
I

764
00:58:01.44 --> 00:58:07.36
Didn't think that was appropriate to say to that a 17 year old girl. I try to lead by example, but I'm not sure

765
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:15.92
That is enough. How can I best explain or show my younger coworkers? Why they should have unmedicated daily discipline in all things when she

766
00:58:16.64 --> 00:58:19.92
When the stakes are only a fryer and not lives

767
00:58:22.56 --> 00:58:24.56
Okay

768
00:58:25.92 --> 00:58:27.92
Let's see

769
00:58:27.92 --> 00:58:29.92
This is

770
00:58:29.92 --> 00:58:32.72
We're kind of in the same vein on some stuff tonight, which is good

771
00:58:33.20 --> 00:58:38.96
Right, it's good first of all because unmedicated daily discipline and all things should be first of for us to apply to you

772
00:58:39.12 --> 00:58:44.96
Not not everyone else around you. Let's start with yourself imposing discipline on other people is not leadership

773
00:58:45.92 --> 00:58:49.76
It's just an awful or authoritarian person barking orders

774
00:58:51.12 --> 00:58:52.48
So

775
00:58:52.48 --> 00:58:56.64
To answer your question well first of all read if you haven't read the book that I caught in me of leadership

776
00:58:56.64 --> 00:58:59.36
Um, you might want to check that one out

777
00:59:00.40 --> 00:59:07.52
There's a couple chapters you could focus on one of them is called resolute but not overbearing one of them is called disciplined but not rigid

778
00:59:08.16 --> 00:59:11.20
One of them is called hold people accountable, but don't hold their hands

779
00:59:12.56 --> 00:59:19.84
And and this is pretty much why we had to write the dichotomy of leadership because you're out there good on you trying to take extreme ownership

780
00:59:21.52 --> 00:59:26.08
And that's great, but you're not you're not paying attention to the dichotomy of leadership

781
00:59:26.08 --> 00:59:32.64
So let me let me break it down for you a little bit more clearly and then you can go read the book as well, which will help you

782
00:59:34.40 --> 00:59:39.72
You say that the stakes are only a clean fryer and not lives and

783
00:59:41.92 --> 00:59:43.92
You're right

784
00:59:44.32 --> 00:59:49.68
Lives are not at stake and neither really is the functionality of the fire itself

785
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:55.12
Because it doesn't have to be completely spotless and in fact if you're trying to keep it completely spotless

786
00:59:55.12 --> 00:59:59.04
It might actually waste time that she could be doing something that's more important like

787
00:59:59.76 --> 01:00:05.76
Prepping the potatoes or washing her hands to keep the food sanitary

788
01:00:07.04 --> 01:00:09.84
So you need to think about that how

789
01:00:10.40 --> 01:00:16.32
Truly important like when you say on when I say because I say this all time and I apologize for throwing you a little bit

790
01:00:16.80 --> 01:00:20.64
Too far in one direction unmitigated daily discipline in all things. There's no

791
01:00:20.64 --> 01:00:25.68
There's no departure from that right that's what it is. There's no departure for that

792
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:31.60
But here's the deal if you're in the military and you got spun up about little things that don't really matter

793
01:00:32.48 --> 01:00:35.76
You are wasting your leadership capital and

794
01:00:36.72 --> 01:00:42.20
When something it actually important it's what you were just talking about echo when something actually important comes up

795
01:00:42.20 --> 01:00:45.12
Your troops aren't even going to listen to you because they don't know what anything

796
01:00:45.12 --> 01:00:48.48
They don't know what's important and what's not because you say that everything is important

797
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:52.64
Like hey, why do I need to stay on watch? Why do I need to stay awake during watch?

798
01:00:54.48 --> 01:00:57.84
That's not any more important to you than whether I have a

799
01:00:58.72 --> 01:01:01.36
Staying on my shirt because you're freaking out about everything

800
01:01:01.92 --> 01:01:03.92
So so how do I know what's what?

801
01:01:06.72 --> 01:01:10.88
Now, here's the deal you can go to far into other direction you can let people do whatever they want

802
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:14.000
They can completely lock discipline and the little things do matter

803
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.56
The little things do matter, but you gotta remember they only matter a little

804
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:22.64
And if you waste your time and you waste your leadership and you waste your energy

805
01:01:23.60 --> 01:01:27.84
On things that don't matter or things that matter very little then you won't be able to

806
01:01:28.32 --> 01:01:32.40
Lead your team when it really counts what happens is it's a slip leash it's a slope

807
01:01:32.40 --> 01:01:35.36
It's it's a it's a slippery slope and if you let

808
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:37.60
Something slide

809
01:01:37.60 --> 01:01:41.60
Then you let something outside then you let something outside eventually you've got no discipline

810
01:01:41.60 --> 01:01:43.60
So you have to be careful of that

811
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.60
But at the same time it's the other direction what you end up in in the other direction if you if you

812
01:01:52.24 --> 01:01:56.24
If you impose unmitigated daily discipline in all things

813
01:01:57.12 --> 01:01:59.12
You're gonna end up like

814
01:01:59.12 --> 01:02:03.04
Here's a movie reference echo Charles animal house sure have you seen it?

815
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:08.56
Yeah, okay, so you don't remember need your mire the ROTC guy

816
01:02:08.56 --> 01:02:14.32
That's yeah, we can everyone you're worthless and weak. He's like that

817
01:02:14.32 --> 01:02:19.44
He's a guy that's just barking and going crazy and that's a comical example, but I'll tell you what you want a real example

818
01:02:20.32 --> 01:02:29.92
A real a real good example that you can check out once again going watch the first episode of the band of brother series and check out Captain Solbel

819
01:02:29.92 --> 01:02:38.56
They're company commander of easy company. He is hardcore and he has he imposes

820
01:02:38.88 --> 01:02:42.96
Absolute unmitigated discipline and all things on his whole company

821
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
He called the line

822
01:02:48.96 --> 01:02:51.36
Oh dirty weapon no no liberty for you

823
01:02:52.24 --> 01:02:54.24
Pass revoked

824
01:02:54.24 --> 01:02:56.24
Rust on your knife past revoked

825
01:02:56.24 --> 01:03:00.64
Uniform out of uniform creases in your boots or creases in your pants

826
01:03:01.28 --> 01:03:02.64
Pass revoked

827
01:03:02.64 --> 01:03:07.84
Oh that guy's doing it. He's doing that unmitigated discipline in all things and guess what happens to him?

828
01:03:08.80 --> 01:03:11.28
He gets fired his troops hate him

829
01:03:12.40 --> 01:03:18.48
He's worried about things that don't matter dick winners totally square the way worries about things that are important

830
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:25.76
And he and as a individual and if you remember I don't even know if they show this in many brothers

831
01:03:25.76 --> 01:03:31.76
But as an individual imposing discipline on himself guess what he's doing during the battle of bolts

832
01:03:31.84 --> 01:03:36.16
Battle of bolts middle the winter snowed in don't have winter gear

833
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:40.08
They're freezing they're dying. What's winter's doing in the morning?

834
01:03:40.64 --> 01:03:42.64
He's up and he's shaving

835
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:46.000
He's getting up and he's shaving his batowing commander comes over like bro

836
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.88
Or are you sure you need to shave he's okay?

837
01:03:50.08 --> 01:03:52.08
Just hold them on so

838
01:03:54.40 --> 01:03:59.44
That's why we wrote that economy leadership this stuff is a balance and you have to learn to balance

839
01:03:59.44 --> 01:04:09.52
You don't want to end up going and ending up like captain so bell and I hope everybody that's has that tendency to want to control things

840
01:04:10.80 --> 01:04:12.80
And they want to use

841
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:19.04
Discipline and they want to use unmitigated daily discipline and all things you want to use that as your slogan

842
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:27.36
To beat people down go watch the first episode of band of brothers and get your act together

843
01:04:30.08 --> 01:04:32.48
Yeah, the fight that reminded me of when you

844
01:04:33.12 --> 01:04:42.24
We're talking about your gym floor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean sure you don't want the you don't want a bag and you're dirty clothes and socks and shoes all over the floor

845
01:04:42.24 --> 01:04:47.68
You worked out, but it does for a reason yeah the same way the whole reasoning got to clean the flyers or the

846
01:04:47.68 --> 01:04:52.56
Flyer for a reason you know, so you know the reason his I'm not as familiar with flyers, but

847
01:04:53.20 --> 01:04:55.20
I'm sure work at Wendy's like I did

848
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.56
I can tell you that the external the external cleanliness of the fryer is not a big deal

849
01:05:00.56 --> 01:05:03.76
Do you want like you said you wanted to be cake to with grease?

850
01:05:04.24 --> 01:05:09.20
Where it's a fire hazard? No, yeah, but guess what it's a functional item that you're using all day

851
01:05:09.20 --> 01:05:14.72
There's gonna be some spots on it and if I'm freaking out about that guess what I got somebody that's not washing their hands or even worse

852
01:05:14.72 --> 01:05:20.24
I got someone that's intentionally sabotaging the food to we get bad reviews now we're going out of business

853
01:05:20.48 --> 01:05:21.68
Yeah, whatever

854
01:05:21.68 --> 01:05:27.68
Yeah, so it's essentially like hey, man identify the use the the optimal use of the fryer and

855
01:05:28.48 --> 01:05:32.16
Let's target that is like the bet the right way to clean it kind of thing

856
01:05:32.16 --> 01:05:37.20
You know and that's sort of it like don't you don't have to sweep your gym floor and mop it

857
01:05:37.20 --> 01:05:40.88
And be sure that you can see your face in the I'm getting more talk on that thing in

858
01:05:41.44 --> 01:05:46.48
23 hours. Yeah, 22 hours right it makes no difference yeah to why I have a gym floor

859
01:05:46.72 --> 01:05:51.12
I have the gym floor so I can drop weights and walk that's it kind of thing not so you know

860
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:57.20
I can I don't know be super disciplined waste of my time mopping it and you know all this stuff because I'm

861
01:05:57.20 --> 01:05:59.20
Unmitigated daily discipline and all things

862
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
You have a functionality you have to uphold

863
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:04.08
Imagine how many

864
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:11.20
Hours of my life. I would have thrown away if I was mopping cleaning sweeping and vacuuming my gym floor every day when I got it

865
01:06:11.20 --> 01:06:18.80
We take as long as my workout or take probably at 20 minutes. I guess yeah, so there's there's what almost two hours a week

866
01:06:18.80 --> 01:06:21.20
Two a little over two hours a week gone gone

867
01:06:21.36 --> 01:06:26.64
You think I got two hours a week think about what two hours two hours is like a massive amount of time

868
01:06:26.88 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah, that's a good two hours is a huge amount of time

869
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.36
Unless give that away you own a commercial gym then you want to mop that floor

870
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.28
Cuz it adds to the functionality

871
01:06:37.28 --> 01:06:44.40
Yeah, you're gonna you're gonna get the floor is gonna be clean. Yep, but guess what here go to the extreme

872
01:06:44.88 --> 01:06:47.28
Hey, we just cleaned that floor don't walk on it

873
01:06:47.28 --> 01:06:50.72
Hey, the part of the gym is shut down for you know because we just moped it. It's like now

874
01:06:51.52 --> 01:06:57.36
You just moped it. We're gonna use it. Yeah, so it's kind at the end of the day. It's kind of like

875
01:06:57.36 --> 01:07:03.92
What unmitigated daily discipline in all things that what that are functional?

876
01:07:04.32 --> 01:07:09.84
That are functional for sure that are our our for yourself for put that on yourself

877
01:07:10.64 --> 01:07:14.48
Put that on yourself and here's what here's you really want to take this to the next level. Yes

878
01:07:14.88 --> 01:07:20.08
Be disciplined in how you impose discipline on people

879
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:24.24
Don't just let it run wild. Do you have to have discipline in it?

880
01:07:24.24 --> 01:07:26.24
That's the way it is

881
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:31.92
Yeah, yeah, kind of does something that picture how yours every time I get these questions

882
01:07:31.92 --> 01:07:34.48
It's like I'm so happy we wrote that I caught a me a leadership

883
01:07:34.88 --> 01:07:37.04
Because there's the answer yeah

884
01:07:37.28 --> 01:07:44.16
That's the answer the answer is this all this is a dichotomy everything is it and people don't want it to be a night dichotomy because it's

885
01:07:44.56 --> 01:07:48.24
dichotomies are complex dichotomies are hard

886
01:07:49.52 --> 01:07:51.52
dichotomies take

887
01:07:51.52 --> 01:07:55.92
It takes skill to learn to balance and it takes awareness of the situation

888
01:07:57.20 --> 01:08:01.68
It's hard it's so much easier to say oh you just impose your discipline to make everyone do you want to do

889
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.84
You can't do that you'll end up with a mutiny my my second pull-toon

890
01:08:08.64 --> 01:08:12.24
The when we had a mutiny we worked for a guy that made us do everything his way

891
01:08:13.20 --> 01:08:18.08
My way or the highway guess what didn't work mutiny. It was a highway, but not for us for him

892
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:24.16
Yeah, yeah, and not a bad guy wasn't a bad guy wouldn't have bad intentions

893
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.80
But that's where this guy is heading he said an OCS and if he keeps with that attitude

894
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:34.32
He's gonna end up in those situations. That's beautiful. I'm so glad he asked this question

895
01:08:35.44 --> 01:08:41.28
Because I'm glad he asked this question because it's not his fault. He's listening to what I said and I didn't

896
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:43.12
Communicate it well enough

897
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:48.72
So now he asked a great question and now he can take a much much better approach a much more

898
01:08:49.28 --> 01:08:51.28
Balance approach in his leadership

899
01:08:53.28 --> 01:08:58.48
Like flying a kite can you look I had a phone a kite, but what this has nothing to do with fun

900
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:01.52
No, no, I should have said I got to bring it back on there

901
01:09:02.80 --> 01:09:07.20
No, but the fundamental principle right you know you know well depend on what kind of kite I get it

902
01:09:07.20 --> 01:09:10.64
But you know kind with the two handles the two strings you know you had a

903
01:09:10.64 --> 01:09:16.48
See I'm saying you got a kind of pull one and let one go a little bit to and then it depends on the wind you know

904
01:09:16.48 --> 01:09:21.92
Depends on how strong the wind is and you got a pull curl let that would lack out from telling me

905
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:25.44
Surflight kite now. I just flew on like maybe like you know five six seven weeks ago

906
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Good windy day. Go by the way next question

907
01:09:29.04 --> 01:09:37.52
As a leader, do you ever come fight in anyone or seek counsel from anyone or do you just wrestle with issues within yourself and try to figure things out on your own?

908
01:09:37.52 --> 01:09:43.28
Another really good question and I do both of course. I try and figure out things on my own, but here's the little

909
01:09:45.04 --> 01:09:48.16
Secret is it a secret? It's not really a secret because I'm not to tell everyone

910
01:09:48.56 --> 01:09:52.48
But it's something that I wouldn't really talk about because it's just something I wouldn't say clearly do

911
01:09:53.60 --> 01:09:55.60
When I'm figuring things out on my own

912
01:09:55.84 --> 01:09:58.24
At the same time I I

913
01:09:58.24 --> 01:09:59.60
Seek counsel

914
01:09:59.60 --> 01:10:03.12
I said it seat counsel from the the trusted

915
01:10:03.76 --> 01:10:05.76
teammates that I have or

916
01:10:05.76 --> 01:10:09.36
peers or superiors or or subordinates that I trust

917
01:10:11.84 --> 01:10:15.52
But while when I counsel them when I when I see counsel when I ask for feedback

918
01:10:16.56 --> 01:10:21.92
While I'm trying to figure out things on my own I actually keep those thoughts to myself

919
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:30.48
In the beginning right I've let other people tell me what their ideas are first I want to hear

920
01:10:30.96 --> 01:10:33.92
What they come up with because if and if somebody comes up with a good plan

921
01:10:33.92 --> 01:10:37.12
We're going with it like if it's a thing you know what that's pretty good plan. We'll go with that

922
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.56
Because as I've said many times I prefer to use one of my subordinates plans

923
01:10:43.12 --> 01:10:48.16
One of my subordinates plan over mine. I would rather to use my subordinates plan

924
01:10:48.80 --> 01:10:52.40
Rather than mine as long as it's technically sound because

925
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.64
Then they they believe in their plan right and if it's not tackly sound yep

926
01:10:58.64 --> 01:11:06.40
I give them a little nudge to make some corrections and still use their plan because I want them to use their solutions in their plans

927
01:11:06.40 --> 01:11:09.76
So that way like I said they have ownership of the plan

928
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:14.80
And when they're coming up with the plan

929
01:11:15.28 --> 01:11:17.44
Guess what's gonna happen they're gonna get too close to it

930
01:11:17.44 --> 01:11:22.48
They're gonna do what I talked about in that opening story which is they're gonna they're gonna be at low altitude

931
01:11:22.48 --> 01:11:26.80
They're gonna be staring at it right in the face and I'm gonna be allowed to

932
01:11:26.80 --> 01:11:34.40
Remain detached and remain out to two so I have a better perspective with the overall plan than they do and that ends up making me look like a tactical genius

933
01:11:34.40 --> 01:11:36.40
Which is awesome

934
01:11:37.60 --> 01:11:41.92
So so I guess this is the secret this is the trick or whatever don't talk so much

935
01:11:44.16 --> 01:11:46.16
Don't talk so much

936
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:48.16
Don't feel the need

937
01:11:48.80 --> 01:11:53.60
Don't feel the need something you have to resist as a leader as a person that wants to be a leader

938
01:11:53.60 --> 01:11:58.80
Yeah, they fully says some about people aspiring leaders right if you're an aspiring leader

939
01:11:59.28 --> 01:12:03.44
Don't feel like you're the person that has to always come up with a plan or come up with a solution

940
01:12:04.16 --> 01:12:08.56
Even when you are the leader don't feel like you're that guy in fact it's better to not do that

941
01:12:09.68 --> 01:12:16.000
It's better just to to think and to just listen to what people are saying and watch their plans

942
01:12:16.64 --> 01:12:22.72
Come out and get shot down and get reformulated and be improved and if you hadn't said anything yet

943
01:12:22.72 --> 01:12:26.40
Guess what the longer you don't say anything the more people are gonna listen when you actually open your mouth

944
01:12:27.52 --> 01:12:33.36
So just kind of keep your mouth shut now here's this is a little bit different because we're talking about like a plan

945
01:12:33.36 --> 01:12:38.000
Right, I'm a strategy or something what if it's something political within your team

946
01:12:38.64 --> 01:12:40.000
You know what I mean then what do you do?

947
01:12:40.56 --> 01:12:44.40
What it is the same thing like I will think I will listen

948
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:50.08
I will discuss things with people and gather intelligence from them

949
01:12:50.08 --> 01:12:52.08
I want to ask them some probing questions

950
01:12:53.12 --> 01:12:57.20
But I'm not gonna divulge what my position is because number one that will influence them

951
01:12:57.20 --> 01:13:03.68
They will make them react and I don't want to influence anyone or make them react until I'm gonna be able to

952
01:13:04.08 --> 01:13:09.20
Influence them and get them to react and act the way that I want them that's gonna benefit the team

953
01:13:11.20 --> 01:13:14.80
So I'm gonna ask some some questions

954
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:20.96
Why what do you think about what do you think about what do you think's going on with Jenny? Is he he seems to be acting is he okay?

955
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:26.88
I'll ask you I'll ask him I'll ask Mike I'll ask Bill I'll ask Jennifer Wilph

956
01:13:26.88 --> 01:13:33.20
I'll find out what's going on in my role Jennifer and Bill they say something a little bit different. Oh, okay

957
01:13:33.20 --> 01:13:36.000
See I'm gonna gather the political perspectives and

958
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.40
Listen I'm gonna let things unfold I'm going to observe

959
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:52.80
And relax and detach and listen and think and calculate that's what we're doing and

960
01:13:53.68 --> 01:13:58.08
Diacodomy if something needs to happen and I have to be decisive

961
01:13:58.48 --> 01:14:01.92
I'm gonna make it a decision. We're gonna go with it. I'm gonna put it out there

962
01:14:01.92 --> 01:14:07.12
So oddly enough as a leader don't talk so much

963
01:14:08.24 --> 01:14:10.24
I know that seems crazy

964
01:14:10.24 --> 01:14:12.24
The more you talk the less people listen

965
01:14:14.96 --> 01:14:16.96
What about in like

966
01:14:17.20 --> 01:14:22.64
Every day stuff I guess maybe this wouldn't really apply to as a leader but maybe like as a person you know

967
01:14:22.64 --> 01:14:26.80
How like like you you know confide in hall like all have a problem come in

968
01:14:26.80 --> 01:14:36.56
It'll be like hey, let me get your advice whatever about something that obviously it didn't feel yeah like appropriate to like just ask all my friends kind of thing, you know like

969
01:14:37.68 --> 01:14:39.68
Do you ever do that

970
01:14:41.44 --> 01:14:42.64
No

971
01:14:42.64 --> 01:14:44.32
You just mainly think about it yourself well

972
01:14:45.68 --> 01:14:47.68
What I would do

973
01:14:48.32 --> 01:14:51.92
Is you know I like I do it I would I just said I would do I'd be like hey, man

974
01:14:52.80 --> 01:14:54.80
What's going on with this?

975
01:14:54.80 --> 01:15:01.84
You know now I guess if you were see you when you come and ask me something you're asking me something you always ask me about something

976
01:15:01.84 --> 01:15:03.84
I'm not a part of anyway

977
01:15:03.84 --> 01:15:10.32
Yeah, so it's different so yeah if it's like that if it's something I'm completely if something if there's someone that's completely outside the situation

978
01:15:10.48 --> 01:15:14.000
Yeah, I'll say hey, this is what's going on. You know this is going on here

979
01:15:14.24 --> 01:15:20.24
We had this happen. I got this situation and just yeah for sure. I'll do that. Yes, so that is good

980
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:26.88
But but if it's within the team then I generally just won't come out and ask like hey

981
01:15:27.92 --> 01:15:33.92
What do you you know I want to change this? It's not gonna be like hey, what what do you? What would you change about?

982
01:15:33.92 --> 01:15:36.72
You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah ask them what they think first

983
01:15:37.52 --> 01:15:40.16
Yeah, because you might have to make some adjustment if I come in and like echo

984
01:15:40.56 --> 01:15:45.44
We're changing the way we record this thing now here's what's happening and you're like oh, okay

985
01:15:45.44 --> 01:15:50.24
In your listening and the first thing you say to me is like that doesn't make any sense

986
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:54.24
Now I feel now I'm an idiot especially when you say well here's the here's why I won't work

987
01:15:54.24 --> 01:15:57.52
Jocco boom you lay out three things instead of I was like hey, man

988
01:15:58.08 --> 01:16:00.56
What would you think about this issue that we're having?

989
01:16:01.20 --> 01:16:03.44
What solutions do you think we could do to solve that?

990
01:16:04.72 --> 01:16:10.48
And I'll be so I get to listen to your ideas and by the way when you come up with one of those ideas and one of them sounds pretty good to me

991
01:16:10.48 --> 01:16:12.48
Guess what we're doing that one

992
01:16:12.48 --> 01:16:17.76
Now who's got ownership of that idea? Yeah, man who's all fired up to implement it. You do

993
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:24.56
Yeah, and I didn't waste any leadership guy in fact I gained leadership capital because now you're like man

994
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:28.32
Jocco's are you trust me, dude? Yeah, it's pretty cool. He's letting me run this

995
01:16:28.88 --> 01:16:33.28
Yeah, and as speaking from person who doesn't necessarily well

996
01:16:34.16 --> 01:16:41.12
It doesn't seem like I necessarily get that big of a payoff to have that to like I'm running this, you know like I don't know for whatever reason didn't I?

997
01:16:41.12 --> 01:16:44.32
I never felt like that was a big thing to me to be like I running it

998
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:49.44
But I don't know maybe it is maybe in my subconscious because I know that you do that to me

999
01:16:49.68 --> 01:16:54.32
And I'm that's why it's actually kind of funny because you don't do it in big with big things necessarily

1000
01:16:54.32 --> 01:16:58.72
You know, maybe maybe you will whatever but so most of the time it's just some little tea

1001
01:16:59.44 --> 01:17:03.44
Some all thing and like oh yeah, you know just totally falling not falling for it

1002
01:17:03.44 --> 01:17:08.72
I get it. You know it's a good tactic but now that how you just fully just illustrate it and me

1003
01:17:08.72 --> 01:17:13.76
Well, I should know this I do know this really that you do that but it's not a bad thing. No

1004
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:19.36
I'm not it's not you over. No, it's not perfect. Yeah. I'm not I'm actually I'm it's actually beneficial to you

1005
01:17:19.36 --> 01:17:24.56
Yeah, you're actually actually are running things. Yeah, you know if I come in and say hey

1006
01:17:24.72 --> 01:17:29.44
We're you know, hey, what do you think kind of table we should get for the podcast what you know

1007
01:17:29.44 --> 01:17:30.72
I mean what do you think?

1008
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:32.96
We think would be the best

1009
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:37.76
lighting system you know like I know what I think that's the see that's the thing

1010
01:17:37.76 --> 01:17:43.92
I don't really divulge is I know what I think yeah and you know what though which you're I know I understand

1011
01:17:44.72 --> 01:17:46.40
But by the way the table thing

1012
01:17:46.64 --> 01:17:48.24
That I tried we on that one

1013
01:17:48.24 --> 01:17:50.24
Yeah, didn't work and I failed

1014
01:17:52.88 --> 01:17:58.88
Actually I failed because I should have put much clearer parameters around the table scenario

1015
01:17:59.44 --> 01:18:02.48
For those of you that don't know what we're talking about which is no one in the world except for us too

1016
01:18:02.48 --> 01:18:10.24
If we had we got a different table for for our recording studio which is right at this moment being expanded

1017
01:18:10.80 --> 01:18:13.28
And but when we were still in the small recording studio

1018
01:18:14.08 --> 01:18:17.84
I figured why we needed a new table because the other one's too big no we're adding another camera

1019
01:18:18.16 --> 01:18:20.80
Okay, we're adding another camera and possible guests so

1020
01:18:21.92 --> 01:18:26.80
So hey man, you know call a crevatable and the one the table that I had gotten in the past

1021
01:18:27.52 --> 01:18:29.52
Let's face it it was

1022
01:18:29.52 --> 01:18:30.56
legit

1023
01:18:30.56 --> 01:18:32.56
Echo goes and gets a table

1024
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:37.36
I don't know if that thing costs $48 but it wasn't worth it

1025
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:43.20
Was the wiggly and small and weak and anyways

1026
01:18:43.84 --> 01:18:48.64
That's an example where I didn't do a good job and it's also an example of occasionally

1027
01:18:49.76 --> 01:18:56.64
Your your vision is in the line like my vision normally you and I have very line vision about something

1028
01:18:56.64 --> 01:18:59.84
You know well, so when it comes to the technical

1029
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:07.60
Nature of what the podcast the table we were not I want to bought that table

1030
01:19:08.48 --> 01:19:14.56
Ever well, I wouldn't have bought that table for like a like a prop to be used in a one-scene

1031
01:19:15.36 --> 01:19:17.36
scenario

1032
01:19:17.36 --> 01:19:19.84
I don't know what that but well

1033
01:19:20.64 --> 01:19:22.24
Okay, so I admit

1034
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:27.04
I don't know if I told you this but I'll admit that the thing is you probably when you got your table

1035
01:19:27.04 --> 01:19:32.32
You probably went somewhere and it was like yeah, that's the table you felt it and was like yeah, I can imagine and you're

1036
01:19:32.32 --> 01:19:39.68
I actually ordered it online, but okay, I'd say I have more even though I know you worked for a moving company

1037
01:19:40.48 --> 01:19:42.48
nonetheless, I think I have more

1038
01:19:44.40 --> 01:19:46.96
I'm more worldly when it comes to furniture

1039
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.88
You might be ready because there's something wrong. Well, I saw it on Amazon. I was like hey, that's a cool table

1040
01:19:52.88 --> 01:19:57.84
And that that's that fits the dimension yeah, I want to came in it's the old

1041
01:19:58.88 --> 01:20:04.16
Story, you know, it's like oh it looked good in the picture. You know kind of thing there when it shows up is like yeah

1042
01:20:04.16 --> 01:20:06.80
You're good in the picture and it's only 30 nine radics

1043
01:20:07.68 --> 01:20:11.12
She last the other table we had was a thousand bucks

1044
01:20:11.68 --> 01:20:15.60
Yeah, yeah, it wasn't a thought it wasn't actually I actually put a minimum price

1045
01:20:16.16 --> 01:20:18.16
Yeah, just to ensure the quality

1046
01:20:18.80 --> 01:20:20.80
Some kind of quality

1047
01:20:20.80 --> 01:20:24.48
Anyway, the point is yes

1048
01:20:25.12 --> 01:20:29.12
When you give somebody you let it be their idea you keep your ideas to yourself

1049
01:20:29.84 --> 01:20:32.96
I'm not trying to be all secretive but I'm not trying to be all secretive

1050
01:20:32.96 --> 01:20:37.04
I'm not gonna tell this person because eventually my idea is if it needs to come out or comes out

1051
01:20:37.04 --> 01:20:40.80
Hopefully it doesn't come out. Hopefully it never needs to come out because my team comes up with a great plan

1052
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:45.20
And I can just be quiet and they can go execute it. That's my goal. Yeah, occasionally

1053
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:50.32
They can't find a solution and it's like hey, man. Yeah, okay. Hey guys, and then maybe you know

1054
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:53.52
I'll do I won't even divulge my whole idea. I'll say he won't what about

1055
01:20:54.40 --> 01:20:56.40
You know what about this?

1056
01:20:56.40 --> 01:21:00.96
Like this oh yeah, that's not bad and man when you see someone get a good idea

1057
01:21:01.92 --> 01:21:05.44
They get so happy. Yes, it's so rewarding yeah

1058
01:21:06.24 --> 01:21:10.64
And so you want to give them that gift and the way you do that is by letting them come up with it

1059
01:21:10.64 --> 01:21:14.000
And I think it's just gonna make sure that they have a world the experience with furniture

1060
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.80
It's stuff. Yeah, that's the situation. All right. Well, there you go and I dig it and because in a way it's not really even about the idea

1061
01:21:20.80 --> 01:21:24.48
It's more about okay. We need a solution to this problem. I don't care what the you know

1062
01:21:24.48 --> 01:21:29.04
The potential solution is kind of thing and yeah, you might have one in your head

1063
01:21:29.04 --> 01:21:32.64
But you don't want to just start saying bro, it's just throwing it around as the one

1064
01:21:32.80 --> 01:21:35.76
You know, it also yes, you're right also when you divulge your idea

1065
01:21:35.76 --> 01:21:40.72
Guess what happens to everyone else's ideas especially when you're in a leadership position when you're in a leadership position and you divulge your idea

1066
01:21:40.72 --> 01:21:46.40
Everyone kind of gravitates towards that idea as being the best if you keep your idea to yourself

1067
01:21:46.72 --> 01:21:49.84
You let the true growth of ideas develop

1068
01:21:49.84 --> 01:21:53.52
Yeah, true things come out when people aren't just trying to say like oh great idea

1069
01:21:53.52 --> 01:22:00.72
Jocca. Oh yeah, even even if they're not like a kiss ass, but you just you just put an idea in their head and they can't see it a different way

1070
01:22:00.72 --> 01:22:06.24
Yeah, you know and even if they do you put them in a position where now they have to shut down your idea

1071
01:22:06.24 --> 01:22:11.84
Not a big deal, but it's doing that is element that you have to you know you got it kind of put them in as far as that position goes

1072
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.96
Yeah, rather than you you'll just kind of open up the floor. It's kind of like back in you know

1073
01:22:16.96 --> 01:22:22.68
Who else something to say kind of kind of live atmosphere, you know, we all can you know

1074
01:22:22.68 --> 01:22:28.44
Throw around ideas and the best one comes though. There you go. Thanks Brian. Oh man. I'll get a better table next time

1075
01:22:28.44 --> 01:22:30.44
I promise next question

1076
01:22:30.44 --> 01:22:32.44
As I get ready to graduate from college

1077
01:22:32.44 --> 01:22:37.84
I would appreciate your input on the following question. I've always loved to take part in a variety of

1078
01:22:37.84 --> 01:22:43.24
of projects and I have ended up in an leadership position in multiple organizations

1079
01:22:44.40 --> 01:22:50.000
Be it in the student VC firm the student body my professional fraternity et cetera in a way

1080
01:22:50.56 --> 01:22:55.68
This is this was natural to me. It's about extreme ownership, right? I love what I was doing

1081
01:22:55.68 --> 01:22:58.32
You shouldn't just slough off that phrase. Oh

1082
01:22:58.32 --> 01:23:04.46
It's like extreme owners right right yeah, that's how it should have been said. Okay, this is okay all this stuff is about extreme ownership, right?

1083
01:23:04.46 --> 01:23:07.70
Can't be that hard right kind of kind of cool no thing of course

1084
01:23:07.70 --> 01:23:13.16
We monitor should right okay. I loved what I was doing. I had a vision where to take things and I was chosen to lead

1085
01:23:13.16 --> 01:23:16.80
So I felt that I was doing the right thing recently though

1086
01:23:16.80 --> 01:23:20.24
I've started to feel overwhelmed and feel that my productivity has diminished

1087
01:23:21.24 --> 01:23:25.52
By being in a manager opposition it seemed harder to see the direct output on my work

1088
01:23:25.52 --> 01:23:35.40
But it's as easy it's as easy as always to see what's not working. I don't want to be like gov any projects because I'll still love to make love to take ownership of them

1089
01:23:35.40 --> 01:23:42.80
He says I don't want to be like what says I don't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take ownership of them

1090
01:23:42.80 --> 01:23:45.44
Oh, yes, yes, yes, okay love take on your going

1091
01:23:45.44 --> 01:23:48.44
Yes, I'm identifying symptoms

1092
01:23:49.08 --> 01:23:51.60
Yeah, you like the word ownership. That's like a like a

1093
01:23:51.60 --> 01:23:57.52
Really I definitely like the word ownership and as you also know I also like another word that's that caught me

1094
01:23:57.52 --> 01:24:01.52
Take out of the words you can see in violations here. All right. Well, either either way

1095
01:24:01.68 --> 01:24:09.52
It's okay. He he doesn't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take ownership of them and lead these organizations

1096
01:24:09.52 --> 01:24:17.24
But I think I'm no longer able to handle this much. How do you balance those things? Yeah, so there is a chapter in the dichotomy leadership called

1097
01:24:18.52 --> 01:24:20.52
own it all

1098
01:24:20.52 --> 01:24:24.16
But that's not the title of chapter. So the title of chapter continues

1099
01:24:24.76 --> 01:24:26.88
It's the title of the chapter is own it all

1100
01:24:27.84 --> 01:24:29.84
comma but

1101
01:24:29.84 --> 01:24:31.84
Empower others

1102
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:39.04
And it sounds like this individual who's getting after it for sure props getting after it leadership position multiple organizations

1103
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:41.72
Going hard taking ownership

1104
01:24:41.72 --> 01:24:47.16
Very cool, but it sounds like he needs to lean more towards decentralized command

1105
01:24:47.16 --> 01:24:52.76
Because just because you take ownership of things doesn't mean you're supposed to do everything

1106
01:24:53.08 --> 01:24:58.04
That you take ownership of it doesn't it doesn't actually doesn't work what this what you need

1107
01:24:58.76 --> 01:25:01.04
Individual is you need

1108
01:25:01.40 --> 01:25:02.92
Subordinate leaders

1109
01:25:02.92 --> 01:25:10.52
Inside these multiple organizations that you're in charge of that you trust and you got to let them run with the broad guidance and the

1110
01:25:11.24 --> 01:25:15.68
Mission the broad guidance of the mission and with your commanders intent

1111
01:25:15.68 --> 01:25:21.88
That's how you're gonna work this so for instance when I was in charge of training on the West Coast

1112
01:25:21.88 --> 01:25:27.72
I was responsible for a lot of stuff for land warfare for maritime operations

1113
01:25:27.72 --> 01:25:36.04
Dive operations air operations close quarters combat urban warfare training mobility training heavy weapons defensive tactics combat leadership and

1114
01:25:36.60 --> 01:25:38.60
Every other block

1115
01:25:38.80 --> 01:25:41.60
Four guys that are getting ready to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan

1116
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:53.04
Now on top of those tactical things. I'm in charge. I'm actually also in charge of safety and actually also in charge of maintenance and actually also in charge of the administration of the command

1117
01:25:54.88 --> 01:25:57.44
That's a lot of stuff to be running right

1118
01:25:57.44 --> 01:26:03.44
I know that homes is in charge of you know the VC firm and student body that's that stuff too

1119
01:26:03.44 --> 01:26:06.68
This is a lot of stuff could I personally

1120
01:26:07.16 --> 01:26:10.52
Manage and conduct all of those things that I was in charge of

1121
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:12.52
Not even close

1122
01:26:13.72 --> 01:26:19.76
Not even close not you you talk about feeling overwhelmed you wouldn't last 15 minutes if you tried to

1123
01:26:20.36 --> 01:26:26.48
Be the person that made every decision and all those different divisions that were inside of the training command

1124
01:26:27.56 --> 01:26:29.16
So I couldn't

1125
01:26:29.16 --> 01:26:40.76
Manage and run them all myself, but I had great leaders that I trusted that were going to make things happen and I gave them the broad guidance of

1126
01:26:41.44 --> 01:26:49.28
What we were trying to do what their part of the mission was the parameters that they were allowed to work within and then go get some

1127
01:26:50.12 --> 01:26:53.84
Then it's the same thing task you to commander task you to commander got two platoons

1128
01:26:53.84 --> 01:27:01.76
Plus you got a squad of augmenties plus you got CBs and you got an intel fuse and sell you got interrogators and you got radio communications crew

1129
01:27:01.76 --> 01:27:06.40
And you got the IT crew and you got you got the whole tactical operation center that you're running

1130
01:27:06.96 --> 01:27:11.92
And it's the same thing I can't run all that no no human can run all that

1131
01:27:12.64 --> 01:27:14.96
So what do you do you have support net leaders that

1132
01:27:15.56 --> 01:27:21.32
Have the broad guidance they understand what the mission is they understand the commanders intent they go forward and get after it and

1133
01:27:21.32 --> 01:27:26.88
They they know the parameters and sometimes they have issues and when they have issues you can step in and you get my hand

1134
01:27:27.88 --> 01:27:30.68
Or sometimes they get all of our box you've got to put them back in the box

1135
01:27:32.48 --> 01:27:36.16
But it's the same thing even right now

1136
01:27:36.16 --> 01:27:42.08
I got echelon front I got the podcast. I got the the store got the supplements the parallel the online training coming out

1137
01:27:42.08 --> 01:27:48.60
We got the T the real estate the gym we get the list goes on and I can't I can't run all those things

1138
01:27:48.60 --> 01:27:55.08
But I got people leading those things and run on those things and I could do the same thing

1139
01:27:55.08 --> 01:27:57.72
It's like hey here's the guy and sir's the mission here's the commanders intent

1140
01:27:57.72 --> 01:28:01.52
Here's the sanity check on something here's the parameters we're trying to move within

1141
01:28:04.36 --> 01:28:11.32
And then go go and get some so if you do well with decentralized command

1142
01:28:11.32 --> 01:28:18.12
You can handle a lot now could you possibly bite off more than you can chew yeah you could get involved in

1143
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:21.12
so many things

1144
01:28:21.12 --> 01:28:28.80
That you don't even have time to monitor the situations at all and you don't have time to tell when people are getting out of their zone

1145
01:28:28.80 --> 01:28:33.68
Or out of the parameters that they're allowed to work with in or you don't have time to help when something goes sideways

1146
01:28:33.88 --> 01:28:38.24
You don't have so you could get there and that will happen especially quickly if

1147
01:28:38.24 --> 01:28:48.32
If you have failed to train and mentor and give directions and give guidance to the leaders that you have that are actually on the front lines run and things

1148
01:28:50.20 --> 01:28:52.20
So

1149
01:28:52.40 --> 01:28:54.40
That's part of it

1150
01:28:54.56 --> 01:28:58.36
Now the other part of it is you can't do any of this

1151
01:28:58.88 --> 01:29:02.72
If your ego will not allow you to let things go

1152
01:29:02.72 --> 01:29:08.68
I mean you literally said I don't want to let go of any projects. I've said this before

1153
01:29:09.40 --> 01:29:14.92
If you want to be in charge of everything you have to be in charge of nothing

1154
01:29:15.44 --> 01:29:21.000
Your goal should be in charge of nothing only if you're in charge of nothing can you truly be in charge of everything

1155
01:29:21.92 --> 01:29:27.80
Because when you're in charge of every single thing guess what you can handle nothing your task saturated it doesn't work

1156
01:29:29.40 --> 01:29:31.40
So

1157
01:29:31.40 --> 01:29:36.32
That's what you need to do get some good solid leaders subordinate leaders

1158
01:29:37.08 --> 01:29:46.24
Empower them train them trust them make sure they understand where they're going make sure they understand what the mission is make sure they understand what the goals are

1159
01:29:47.68 --> 01:29:53.04
Make sure they understand what things are outside the box that they need to come and talk to you about

1160
01:29:53.04 --> 01:29:58.96
And then let them rock and roll boom

1161
01:30:05.16 --> 01:30:12.28
My wife and I suffered three weeks of turmoil which including losing which included losing a child

1162
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:18.32
How do I expedite that moment when we pick up ourselves pick ourselves up and keep moving forward

1163
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:24.40
Because I'm done sulking and we need to move forward basically how to push through

1164
01:30:29.32 --> 01:30:31.32
So

1165
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.84
I mean obviously that's part breaking and I

1166
01:30:36.84 --> 01:30:49.04
Can't even imagine the pain that you are going through in this situation and so one of those things we've talked about this before the fact is

1167
01:30:49.32 --> 01:30:55.16
We don't really have a cultural protocol for what to do

1168
01:30:56.44 --> 01:30:58.68
when we lose a loved one and

1169
01:31:01.48 --> 01:31:03.48
You have to

1170
01:31:03.48 --> 01:31:06.76
Basically make up that protocol I

1171
01:31:08.16 --> 01:31:10.16
Can't I

1172
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:14.48
Can't dictate what that protocol is going to be for you

1173
01:31:15.56 --> 01:31:17.56
but I can

1174
01:31:18.40 --> 01:31:23.84
Tell you some things from my perspective from some of the

1175
01:31:24.88 --> 01:31:29.04
Things that I've been through I can tell you my perspective on

1176
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:31.04
On

1177
01:31:31.04 --> 01:31:38.48
loss and the first thing is that you already know it's going to be

1178
01:31:38.88 --> 01:31:40.88
Ratchet and

1179
01:31:41.88 --> 01:31:44.38
You're not going to escape it and

1180
01:31:46.80 --> 01:31:51.28
That pain and this is this is something that I've identified

1181
01:31:52.40 --> 01:31:57.08
The pain that's going to come it's going to come in waves and

1182
01:31:57.08 --> 01:32:05.16
And at first you won't even notice that there are waves because all the waves are going to be so close together

1183
01:32:05.16 --> 01:32:13.80
And they're going to be so continual and they're going to be right on top of each other and the pain and the sadness is going to feel like it's so

1184
01:32:14.36 --> 01:32:15.16
heavy

1185
01:32:15.16 --> 01:32:17.16
It's going to feel like you are

1186
01:32:17.88 --> 01:32:24.76
Drowning in sorrow like you're not going to get in any air and like you're not going to be able to escape that sadness

1187
01:32:24.76 --> 01:32:28.92
That's what the waves feel like at first

1188
01:32:33.40 --> 01:32:42.52
And then at some point there's going to be a little break just a little break just a little bit of light in the dark

1189
01:32:42.52 --> 01:32:47.000
There's something is going to make you smile something is going to make you laugh

1190
01:32:47.72 --> 01:32:50.84
Something's going to just show you just a little bit of light

1191
01:32:50.84 --> 01:32:53.96
But I don't know when that's going to happen

1192
01:32:56.28 --> 01:33:02.68
And then you're going to see that little smile that little light and then the another wave of pain

1193
01:33:03.56 --> 01:33:08.20
Is going to come back again and it's going to be strong and you won't have any control over it

1194
01:33:09.48 --> 01:33:13.24
You won't be able to say no no I'm I'm I'm in the right now or I'm smiling right now

1195
01:33:13.24 --> 01:33:16.76
I'm not going to I'm not going to go back there no you're not going to be able to control it and that's scary

1196
01:33:16.76 --> 01:33:25.08
It's scary because we we get used to as a dulltay we can kind of get control of things and all of a sudden you're not going to have control

1197
01:33:26.60 --> 01:33:28.92
It's going to hit you and you're going to feel it

1198
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:37.80
But again like a wave like a wave in the ocean that is going to eventually subside again

1199
01:33:38.84 --> 01:33:44.12
And you'll see a little bit of light and you'll get a little bit of a smile and you'll feel okay for second

1200
01:33:44.12 --> 01:33:46.12
Then guess what another wave's going to hit you and

1201
01:33:48.04 --> 01:33:54.04
My not be as strong as that other way wave and you might not even notice that it's not a strong

1202
01:33:54.52 --> 01:34:00.52
But again, you can't control your emotions and you'll find yourself this is what I'm talking about factually

1203
01:34:01.56 --> 01:34:03.56
You're going to be sitting there and

1204
01:34:04.20 --> 01:34:05.72
All of a sudden

1205
01:34:05.72 --> 01:34:07.72
You're going to be just crying uncontrollably

1206
01:34:07.72 --> 01:34:15.16
That wave is going to hit you you're going to go from normal to just crying uncontrollably and being sad

1207
01:34:17.32 --> 01:34:21.96
That's what's going to happen and again you're in your mind you're going to be thinking I can't control this

1208
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:25.88
It's a wave and you're you're at the mercy of this ocean of sorrow

1209
01:34:28.04 --> 01:34:30.04
But don't let that scare you

1210
01:34:31.32 --> 01:34:36.68
Don't let that scare you because I'm telling you that that wave is going to subside again

1211
01:34:36.68 --> 01:34:40.28
And this is going to go on it's going to go on and the waves

1212
01:34:42.20 --> 01:34:44.20
They will become weaker

1213
01:34:46.68 --> 01:34:51.48
And what you need to realize is just because the waves are becoming weaker this doesn't mean

1214
01:34:52.28 --> 01:34:57.000
That you love your child less or you miss them less or that you aren't

1215
01:34:57.64 --> 01:35:03.80
Crushed at their passing it just means that you're starting to be able to deal with it

1216
01:35:03.80 --> 01:35:06.76
Which is what you're supposed to do

1217
01:35:10.12 --> 01:35:12.76
And as the waves get weaker

1218
01:35:13.96 --> 01:35:17.32
Which they will they'll also appear less frequently

1219
01:35:19.48 --> 01:35:21.24
And again that's okay

1220
01:35:21.24 --> 01:35:27.24
It doesn't mean that you don't think of your child over the time it just means that it's being dealt with

1221
01:35:27.24 --> 01:35:29.24
If

1222
01:35:32.28 --> 01:35:34.28
And while this is happening

1223
01:35:36.20 --> 01:35:43.32
While you when you can when you start to when the when the storm waves start to come a little bit

1224
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:49.48
What you can do is you can row the boat

1225
01:35:49.48 --> 01:35:57.000
Carole the boat and what I mean by that is start doing something productive to get your mind

1226
01:35:57.40 --> 01:35:59.40
Moving forward

1227
01:35:59.40 --> 01:36:02.76
I don't know how long this is this is you know

1228
01:36:03.72 --> 01:36:07.000
When you feel a little bit of a break

1229
01:36:08.28 --> 01:36:11.48
Then let's do it a few days go by

1230
01:36:12.44 --> 01:36:14.76
Five days go by three days go by

1231
01:36:14.76 --> 01:36:21.64
At some point you can't cry anymore. Okay, let's do something productive. Let's

1232
01:36:22.36 --> 01:36:30.12
Sort out the drawers in the bedroom. Let's back you. Let's finish a prod let's do something productive and

1233
01:36:30.84 --> 01:36:32.84
if there's something

1234
01:36:34.36 --> 01:36:37.16
That distracts you that's fine do it

1235
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:42.92
Let let let let there be some calm in the water and

1236
01:36:46.36 --> 01:36:48.36
Also

1237
01:36:48.68 --> 01:36:50.68
As the as the calm comes

1238
01:36:52.68 --> 01:36:58.68
Also you're gonna find moments where it's like you can you can have things that are gonna bring on the waves

1239
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:02.76
And that's okay to

1240
01:37:02.76 --> 01:37:09.96
Bring on the waves go look at the pictures right down the memories read the letters read the notes read the emails

1241
01:37:12.68 --> 01:37:14.68
Remember

1242
01:37:16.68 --> 01:37:18.68
And then there's that

1243
01:37:18.52 --> 01:37:23.16
Standard service you're gonna do the memorial you're gonna do the burial

1244
01:37:26.28 --> 01:37:28.28
And when that's over

1245
01:37:28.28 --> 01:37:32.52
Let a little bit of more time go by

1246
01:37:34.28 --> 01:37:36.28
Give yourself another week a

1247
01:37:37.88 --> 01:37:39.88
Washington round a

1248
01:37:40.76 --> 01:37:43.000
Feeling that sorrow of letting the waves

1249
01:37:45.80 --> 01:37:47.80
Toss you around in the ocean

1250
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.76
But after another week what you do is you go and you write a letter you write a letter to your child

1251
01:37:56.76 --> 01:37:58.76
And you explain to them

1252
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Explain to them

1253
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:07.48
How much they meant to you?

1254
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:18.60
Explain to them how heartbroken you are that they are gone and then explain to them

1255
01:38:19.08 --> 01:38:21.72
Why you are going to carry on?

1256
01:38:21.72 --> 01:38:30.04
Why you are going to keep going with them in your heart?

1257
01:38:33.80 --> 01:38:35.80
Explain to them

1258
01:38:36.12 --> 01:38:39.72
Why you're not going to dwell in their loss

1259
01:38:45.32 --> 01:38:51.48
And explain to them how in losing them you have learned without a shred of

1260
01:38:51.48 --> 01:38:54.52
Doubt how truly precious life is

1261
01:38:56.60 --> 01:38:58.60
And that they have taught you

1262
01:39:01.72 --> 01:39:07.88
The immeasurable value of your own life and your wife's life and your family's life

1263
01:39:07.88 --> 01:39:18.52
And explain to them that you know

1264
01:39:18.52 --> 01:39:34.44
That you know that they loved you and that you know that they would want more than anything for you to be happy and productive and impactful in the world

1265
01:39:34.44 --> 01:39:48.28
And explain in that letter what you will do to make them proud of how you live your life

1266
01:39:48.28 --> 01:40:13.96
And then take that letter and go to their grave and read it to them and cry and kiss their soul

1267
01:40:18.44 --> 01:40:20.84
And tell them that you will see them on the other side

1268
01:40:26.12 --> 01:40:31.80
And then go live your life

1269
01:40:34.60 --> 01:40:40.84
And those waves are still going to come and they're still going to be pain and they're still going to be sorrow

1270
01:40:40.84 --> 01:40:48.52
But you go and live your life and live it well

1271
01:40:51.88 --> 01:40:55.24
And make them proud

1272
01:40:55.24 --> 01:41:08.12
And I think that's

1273
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:16.04
All I've got for tonight

1274
01:41:16.04 --> 01:41:20.52
그래

1275
01:41:22.68 --> 01:41:25.88
So Echo

1276
01:41:28.44 --> 01:41:33.64
Go ahead

1277
01:41:33.64 --> 01:41:38.12
ys

1278
01:41:38.12 --> 01:41:40.12
Something like that

1279
01:41:40.12 --> 01:41:47.12
It doesn't always have to be like, you know, losing a child, they can be losing anyone, yeah.

1280
01:41:47.12 --> 01:41:48.12
For sure.

1281
01:41:48.12 --> 01:41:55.12
It's like, my wife had a, you know, she lost someone that she was close to whatever.

1282
01:41:55.12 --> 01:42:01.12
So even if you're not in the, or if you're in a situation where someone's close to you, like, lost someone,

1283
01:42:01.12 --> 01:42:05.12
it's good to keep like something like this in my knee, you know, that it's going to come and go, you know,

1284
01:42:05.12 --> 01:42:10.12
because it's easy to be like, oh, yeah, like, oh, yeah, they're over it.

1285
01:42:10.12 --> 01:42:12.12
And also it's kind of cool now.

1286
01:42:12.12 --> 01:42:16.12
And then it comes back and you're like, wait, I thought you're over it kind of thing, like you can't.

1287
01:42:16.12 --> 01:42:22.12
Yep, that's an unfortunate lesson I've learned is just that.

1288
01:42:22.12 --> 01:42:23.12
Yeah.

1289
01:42:23.12 --> 01:42:29.12
And you think it's a really great description of what it feels like.

1290
01:42:29.12 --> 01:42:30.12
It feels like waves.

1291
01:42:30.12 --> 01:42:32.12
If you serve for you, been in the ocean.

1292
01:42:32.12 --> 01:42:36.12
And, and we've been getting hit by waves and like there's nothing you can do.

1293
01:42:36.12 --> 01:42:40.12
And that way, if it's you, you're going to do it that way once you do, for a little while.

1294
01:42:40.12 --> 01:42:41.12
Yeah.

1295
01:42:41.12 --> 01:42:45.12
And sometimes when it's bad, like you're going to get hit with a wave wave wave, you can barely even tell.

1296
01:42:45.12 --> 01:42:47.12
You come up for a breath, you're getting hit again.

1297
01:42:47.12 --> 01:42:48.12
Yeah.

1298
01:42:48.12 --> 01:42:49.12
And that's what it feels like.

1299
01:42:49.12 --> 01:42:50.12
Yeah.

1300
01:42:50.12 --> 01:42:51.12
It feels like it.

1301
01:42:51.12 --> 01:42:58.12
And the other weird thing is you can be, you can go from one extreme emotion to another in a minute.

1302
01:42:58.12 --> 01:43:04.12
You can be laughing and that laughter can trigger thoughts that make you sad.

1303
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:06.12
And you could hit with a wave.

1304
01:43:06.12 --> 01:43:12.12
And one thing, and I think this is important is that.

1305
01:43:12.12 --> 01:43:18.12
You know, you know what I've talked about, like the person that's in a turmoil in their heads in a cloud of like a storm cloud.

1306
01:43:18.12 --> 01:43:21.12
And no matter where they look, they just can't see.

1307
01:43:21.12 --> 01:43:23.12
They don't see that there's a way out.

1308
01:43:23.12 --> 01:43:26.12
And anyone that's standing on the outside can see like, no, come on.

1309
01:43:26.12 --> 01:43:29.12
Just walk over here, just get away from that storm cloud.

1310
01:43:29.12 --> 01:43:30.12
You can do it.

1311
01:43:30.12 --> 01:43:32.12
But when they're standing in the middle, they don't even know which way to walk.

1312
01:43:32.12 --> 01:43:37.12
So they just stand there and they just sit in the storm cloud and they think that they're never going to get out.

1313
01:43:37.12 --> 01:43:44.12
And it's the initial feeling after loss is like, oh, this isn't going to go away.

1314
01:43:44.12 --> 01:43:47.12
And what I'm telling you is it's going to.

1315
01:43:47.12 --> 01:43:53.12
And there's a certain level of guilt of like, way to second, how can I be not thinking about?

1316
01:43:53.12 --> 01:43:56.12
I just didn't think about, you know, this person for five minutes.

1317
01:43:56.12 --> 01:43:58.12
I'm horrible.

1318
01:43:58.12 --> 01:44:01.12
It's like, no, you have to process this.

1319
01:44:01.12 --> 01:44:02.12
Yeah.

1320
01:44:02.12 --> 01:44:05.12
And no one wants you to dwell on this.

1321
01:44:05.12 --> 01:44:06.12
No one.

1322
01:44:06.12 --> 01:44:09.12
They never want you to forget, but they don't want you to dwell as well.

1323
01:44:09.12 --> 01:44:12.12
There's a dichotomy in that.

1324
01:44:12.12 --> 01:44:18.12
And that's why, you know, obviously it's heartbreaking to get that note.

1325
01:44:18.12 --> 01:44:27.12
But hopefully, you know, that recognition that those waves are going to subside eventually.

1326
01:44:27.12 --> 01:44:30.12
They're still going to get hit with some of them.

1327
01:44:30.12 --> 01:44:38.12
But they are in it's okay that you're going to be there.

1328
01:44:38.12 --> 01:44:39.12
Yeah.

1329
01:44:39.12 --> 01:44:41.12
Yeah.

1330
01:44:41.12 --> 01:44:42.12
Ugh.

1331
01:44:42.12 --> 01:44:43.12
Ruff.

1332
01:44:43.12 --> 01:44:44.12
Yeah.

1333
01:44:44.12 --> 01:44:45.12
Yeah.

1334
01:44:45.12 --> 01:44:56.12
But you know, when I wrote, Mikey in the Dragons, I have the, you know, the king dice, right?

1335
01:44:56.12 --> 01:45:00.12
The king, you don't know him, but the king is dead.

1336
01:45:00.12 --> 01:45:05.12
And there's certain people, you know, I figured if I actually thought to myself, like, well,

1337
01:45:05.12 --> 01:45:07.12
do I really want to talk about death?

1338
01:45:07.12 --> 01:45:10.12
And there's also there's a couple lines with a dragon to want to kill you.

1339
01:45:10.12 --> 01:45:12.12
You know, the dragons want to kill, right?

1340
01:45:12.12 --> 01:45:14.12
There's a couple times for asking, well, do I, you know, this is a kids book.

1341
01:45:14.12 --> 01:45:16.12
But here's the deal.

1342
01:45:16.12 --> 01:45:20.12
There's little kids that's parents dies, that grand parents die.

1343
01:45:20.12 --> 01:45:25.12
I mean, those, the death is a real death is a 100% part of life.

1344
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:28.12
And you got to learn, you got to learn how to deal with that.

1345
01:45:28.12 --> 01:45:29.12
Yeah.

1346
01:45:29.12 --> 01:45:34.12
Or else it's going to be, you know, that, you, and I'm not saying you got to dive into it with a little kid.

1347
01:45:34.12 --> 01:45:35.12
Right.

1348
01:45:35.12 --> 01:45:37.12
But you have to at least, they have to hear the word.

1349
01:45:37.12 --> 01:45:39.12
They have to understand that that's a reality.

1350
01:45:39.12 --> 01:45:40.12
Yeah.

1351
01:45:40.12 --> 01:45:41.12
So.

1352
01:45:41.12 --> 01:45:42.12
Yeah.

1353
01:45:42.12 --> 01:45:44.12
Oh, that's it.

1354
01:45:44.12 --> 01:45:46.12
My, I had this video.

1355
01:45:46.12 --> 01:45:49.12
He was like, deusere the day before that my wife took my son here.

1356
01:45:49.12 --> 01:45:51.12
A dragon costume on.

1357
01:45:51.12 --> 01:45:52.12
He's two.

1358
01:45:52.12 --> 01:45:53.12
By the way.

1359
01:45:53.12 --> 01:45:56.12
And he's like, oh, I'm going to go kill daddy.

1360
01:45:56.12 --> 01:45:59.12
I was like, whoa, kill, like, where did you even kind of,

1361
01:45:59.12 --> 01:46:04.12
and it's, the reason I bring that out because it dragons that are ready to kill, right?

1362
01:46:04.12 --> 01:46:05.12
Yeah.

1363
01:46:05.12 --> 01:46:06.12
That's from the one.

1364
01:46:06.12 --> 01:46:08.12
Mike isn't, Mike, in the dragon.

1365
01:46:08.12 --> 01:46:11.12
Because that's kind of how you feel, you know, even though you don't know, as a kid,

1366
01:46:11.12 --> 01:46:16.12
however old, whatever, you don't know what the magnitude of that is.

1367
01:46:16.12 --> 01:46:19.12
But you know, you know, like, what do you scared of, whatever the unknown,

1368
01:46:19.12 --> 01:46:22.12
sure you're, but you're scared of the monster in the closet,

1369
01:46:22.12 --> 01:46:26.12
or you scared of him not because he's going to bore you to death with bad jokes.

1370
01:46:26.12 --> 01:46:27.12
He's like, he's going to kill you.

1371
01:46:27.12 --> 01:46:32.12
That's what you're scared of, you know, kind of thing as even if you're six years old, kind of thing.

1372
01:46:32.12 --> 01:46:34.12
So yeah, I mean, make sense for sure.

1373
01:46:34.12 --> 01:46:39.12
And, and even think about what you kill a bug, right?

1374
01:46:39.12 --> 01:46:43.12
Yeah, like a little kid, the kill a bug, they're eating a chicken.

1375
01:46:43.12 --> 01:46:46.12
That chicken was alive, and now it's dead, you're eating it, right?

1376
01:46:46.12 --> 01:46:48.12
The death is a real thing.

1377
01:46:48.12 --> 01:46:52.12
And you have to, you have to deal with it, you know?

1378
01:46:52.12 --> 01:46:55.12
And like I said, we don't have a great protocol.

1379
01:46:55.12 --> 01:46:59.12
And I know we talked, we joked about making a protocol for breaking up with a girlfriend.

1380
01:46:59.12 --> 01:47:02.12
Yeah, a little bit more light-hearted for sure, but it's something.

1381
01:47:02.12 --> 01:47:08.12
But I'll tell you what, hey, you talk about light-hearted breaking up with a girlfriend,

1382
01:47:08.12 --> 01:47:16.12
think about the tragic situations you've seen unfold from somebody breaking up with their girlfriend or breaking up with their boyfriend.

1383
01:47:16.12 --> 01:47:17.12
Yeah.

1384
01:47:17.12 --> 01:47:19.12
It's horrible.

1385
01:47:19.12 --> 01:47:21.12
And there should be a protocol.

1386
01:47:21.12 --> 01:47:24.12
And there should be a protocol for any loss to loved one.

1387
01:47:24.12 --> 01:47:25.12
Here's the protocol.

1388
01:47:25.12 --> 01:47:26.12
Here's what I'm going to do.

1389
01:47:26.12 --> 01:47:31.12
And you know what, part of that protocol should be, you write a letter to that person and you explain what I just said.

1390
01:47:31.12 --> 01:47:35.12
That is a real,

1391
01:47:35.12 --> 01:47:39.12
that that will clear a lot out of you.

1392
01:47:39.12 --> 01:47:42.12
It will bring you in touch with that person again.

1393
01:47:42.12 --> 01:47:47.12
It'll give you permission from them to go and do it.

1394
01:47:47.12 --> 01:47:49.12
You're supposed to do you have to.

1395
01:47:49.12 --> 01:47:51.12
They want that.

1396
01:47:51.12 --> 01:47:53.12
You know what they want that.

1397
01:47:53.12 --> 01:47:58.12
Yeah, because it kind of feels like, hey, I'm going to go, I don't know.

1398
01:47:58.12 --> 01:48:01.12
I'm going to go back to school or something like that.

1399
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:04.12
It's kind of like, whoa, how can you think about going back to school when you're,

1400
01:48:04.12 --> 01:48:07.12
when this just happened kind of thing.

1401
01:48:07.12 --> 01:48:16.12
That's what you feel like, you know, but yeah, on the other side is kind of like, no, yeah, that's what they would want you to do kind of thing.

1402
01:48:16.12 --> 01:48:17.12
It doesn't feel like that.

1403
01:48:17.12 --> 01:48:20.12
But when you kind of step back and be like, wait, it does kind of feel like that.

1404
01:48:20.12 --> 01:48:24.12
You know, if you can see, just see fit to see it that way.

1405
01:48:24.12 --> 01:48:28.12
Rough, well, to those out there,

1406
01:48:28.12 --> 01:48:34.12
hey, stay strong, you know, live your life.

1407
01:48:34.12 --> 01:48:39.12
Cool. Well, talk about origin, you know, it is a rough transition.

1408
01:48:39.12 --> 01:48:40.12
They're with me.

1409
01:48:40.12 --> 01:48:42.12
Well, we're talking about living and living well.

1410
01:48:42.12 --> 01:48:43.12
Sure.

1411
01:48:43.12 --> 01:48:44.12
We want to live well.

1412
01:48:44.12 --> 01:48:45.12
Yeah.

1413
01:48:45.12 --> 01:48:46.12
We want to move forward.

1414
01:48:46.12 --> 01:48:47.12
Yeah.

1415
01:48:47.12 --> 01:48:49.12
Yeah.

1416
01:48:49.12 --> 01:48:52.12
So, is due to your two-party your life?

1417
01:48:52.12 --> 01:48:53.12
That's a question.

1418
01:48:53.12 --> 01:48:54.12
There's no way.

1419
01:48:54.12 --> 01:48:56.12
There's no good way to do that.

1420
01:48:56.12 --> 01:48:58.12
Oh, yeah. I know. I have the same hate. Okay.

1421
01:48:58.12 --> 01:49:00.12
Look, origin, look, origin main.com.

1422
01:49:00.12 --> 01:49:01.12
This is where you get your gear.

1423
01:49:01.12 --> 01:49:05.12
If you still need a gear, or if you want a new gear, go ahead and get it from origin.

1424
01:49:05.12 --> 01:49:06.12
It's the best.

1425
01:49:06.12 --> 01:49:08.12
They are the best. And they're made in America.

1426
01:49:08.12 --> 01:49:10.12
They're not necessarily the best because they're made in America.

1427
01:49:10.12 --> 01:49:11.12
They're going for adventure.

1428
01:49:11.12 --> 01:49:12.12
They're great.

1429
01:49:12.12 --> 01:49:13.12
No, I'm telling.

1430
01:49:13.12 --> 01:49:18.12
I'm reminding myself why I really like origin geese because they're just busted one out the other day.

1431
01:49:18.12 --> 01:49:20.12
No, I was thinking you're really going for it.

1432
01:49:20.12 --> 01:49:22.12
You're like, okay.

1433
01:49:22.12 --> 01:49:24.12
When I was thinking as you were doing that, I was like,

1434
01:49:24.12 --> 01:49:26.12
hey, I'm sitting here telling people like, hey,

1435
01:49:26.12 --> 01:49:28.12
sometimes you've got to move on.

1436
01:49:28.12 --> 01:49:31.12
And we were literally having our time moving on.

1437
01:49:31.12 --> 01:49:34.12
And until I was just simply talking about this,

1438
01:49:34.12 --> 01:49:37.12
talking about little loss or a loved one,

1439
01:49:37.12 --> 01:49:39.12
and you're just like, okay, we're going to move on.

1440
01:49:39.12 --> 01:49:42.12
Well, and you just laughed.

1441
01:49:42.12 --> 01:49:43.12
No, no, no, no.

1442
01:49:43.12 --> 01:49:45.12
I'm saying that in a positive way.

1443
01:49:45.12 --> 01:49:46.12
Like you got to.

1444
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:47.12
Yeah.

1445
01:49:47.12 --> 01:49:50.12
Well, this situation, you know,

1446
01:49:50.12 --> 01:49:52.12
you got me talking about GG2.

1447
01:49:52.12 --> 01:49:54.12
Yeah, I'm just trained yesterday.

1448
01:49:54.12 --> 01:49:57.12
So it's like, you know, you can't even feel good about that one.

1449
01:49:57.12 --> 01:49:58.12
It's true.

1450
01:49:58.12 --> 01:49:59.12
Yes.

1451
01:49:59.12 --> 01:50:01.12
Which is what you just do does by the way.

1452
01:50:01.12 --> 01:50:02.12
Yeah.

1453
01:50:02.12 --> 01:50:04.12
And that's another thing.

1454
01:50:04.12 --> 01:50:07.12
It's like, you got to move on.

1455
01:50:07.12 --> 01:50:08.12
You got it.

1456
01:50:08.12 --> 01:50:10.12
You're going to go through rough transition.

1457
01:50:10.12 --> 01:50:12.12
But like you said, you got to look at your kid and be like, okay.

1458
01:50:12.12 --> 01:50:14.12
We, you got to go back to school.

1459
01:50:14.12 --> 01:50:17.12
But what about, you know, what about my sister,

1460
01:50:17.12 --> 01:50:20.12
what about my brother, what about grandma, whatever, whoever died.

1461
01:50:20.12 --> 01:50:21.12
Yeah.

1462
01:50:21.12 --> 01:50:24.12
That's part of life is death.

1463
01:50:24.12 --> 01:50:25.12
And we got to move on.

1464
01:50:25.12 --> 01:50:26.12
We're going to go.

1465
01:50:26.12 --> 01:50:27.12
Yeah.

1466
01:50:27.12 --> 01:50:30.12
And then they're going to reference echo Charles transition,

1467
01:50:30.12 --> 01:50:34.12
a rough transition to talking about GG2.

1468
01:50:34.12 --> 01:50:35.12
GG2.

1469
01:50:35.12 --> 01:50:36.12
Yeah.

1470
01:50:36.12 --> 01:50:37.12
All right.

1471
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:38.12
But you see this?

1472
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:39.12
I'm smiling.

1473
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:40.12
So you know what I mean?

1474
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:41.12
Yeah.

1475
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:41.12
It's a positive thing.

1476
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:42.12
Yes.

1477
01:50:42.12 --> 01:50:43.12
You're bringing me out.

1478
01:50:43.12 --> 01:50:48.12
That the reason we started doing the, the, the, the long extended support

1479
01:50:48.12 --> 01:50:50.12
was to kind of decompress.

1480
01:50:50.12 --> 01:50:55.12
I remember there was some, the, the first time I think he might have been a podcast number 12.

1481
01:50:55.12 --> 01:50:57.12
No, no, wasn't it.

1482
01:50:57.12 --> 01:51:01.12
I don't know what podcast it was where I was like, I need to break.

1483
01:51:01.12 --> 01:51:02.12
Oh, yeah.

1484
01:51:02.12 --> 01:51:04.12
I just need to, like, you need to talk for a little while.

1485
01:51:04.12 --> 01:51:05.12
Yeah.

1486
01:51:05.12 --> 01:51:07.12
It's a stupid, light hearted.

1487
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:08.12
Thanks for, yeah.

1488
01:51:08.12 --> 01:51:10.12
No, that's, that's a compliment.

1489
01:51:10.12 --> 01:51:12.12
No, it's not a compliment.

1490
01:51:12.12 --> 01:51:13.12
Especially not at the time.

1491
01:51:13.12 --> 01:51:14.12
Talk, something.

1492
01:51:14.12 --> 01:51:16.12
But that was the reason.

1493
01:51:16.12 --> 01:51:17.12
Yeah.

1494
01:51:17.12 --> 01:51:18.12
There's no way to rough.

1495
01:51:18.12 --> 01:51:19.12
How do you transition?

1496
01:51:19.12 --> 01:51:22.12
And the other thing you don't want to do is just,

1497
01:51:22.12 --> 01:51:25.12
close on that note, turn off and leave.

1498
01:51:25.12 --> 01:51:27.12
Yeah, that's not cool.

1499
01:51:27.12 --> 01:51:27.12
Yeah.

1500
01:51:27.12 --> 01:51:30.12
So there's, there's plenty of people that say, thank you.

1501
01:51:30.12 --> 01:51:31.12
Yeah.

1502
01:51:31.12 --> 01:51:32.12
For,

1503
01:51:32.12 --> 01:51:37.12
going through the transition and then doing something a little more lighthearted

1504
01:51:37.12 --> 01:51:39.12
at the end of the podcast.

1505
01:51:39.12 --> 01:51:40.12
Yeah.

1506
01:51:40.12 --> 01:51:41.12
So,

1507
01:51:41.12 --> 01:51:42.12
Makes sense.

1508
01:51:42.12 --> 01:51:44.12
I, I support that.

1509
01:51:44.12 --> 01:51:46.12
And we carry on with the tradition.

1510
01:51:46.12 --> 01:51:47.12
The tradition.

1511
01:51:47.12 --> 01:51:48.12
All right.

1512
01:51:48.12 --> 01:51:49.12
Rough transition.

1513
01:51:49.12 --> 01:51:50.12
I'm on board.

1514
01:51:50.12 --> 01:51:52.12
Cool.

1515
01:51:52.12 --> 01:51:53.12
So back to GG2.

1516
01:51:53.12 --> 01:51:54.12
Makes sense.

1517
01:51:54.12 --> 01:51:55.12
So good.

1518
01:51:55.12 --> 01:51:56.12
Good.

1519
01:51:56.12 --> 01:51:56.12
Solid.

1520
01:51:56.12 --> 01:51:57.12
You know, train yesterday.

1521
01:51:57.12 --> 01:52:00.12
Thought about origin the whole time.

1522
01:52:00.12 --> 01:52:01.12
Mm-hmm.

1523
01:52:01.12 --> 01:52:02.12
Got after it.

1524
01:52:02.12 --> 01:52:04.12
Then the last year when you get,

1525
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:06.12
G or a rash cart go to origin.me.com.

1526
01:52:06.12 --> 01:52:08.12
They got some other cool stuff on there as well.

1527
01:52:08.12 --> 01:52:09.12
joggers.

1528
01:52:09.12 --> 01:52:10.12
If you're into it.

1529
01:52:10.12 --> 01:52:11.12
T-shirts.

1530
01:52:11.12 --> 01:52:12.12
If you're into it.

1531
01:52:12.12 --> 01:52:13.12
Supplements.

1532
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:14.12
Mm-hmm.

1533
01:52:14.12 --> 01:52:15.12
Yeah.

1534
01:52:15.12 --> 01:52:16.12
That you need to get into.

1535
01:52:16.12 --> 01:52:18.12
And this is why.

1536
01:52:18.12 --> 01:52:19.12
So,

1537
01:52:19.12 --> 01:52:20.12
Crill oil.

1538
01:52:20.12 --> 01:52:20.12
Okay.

1539
01:52:20.12 --> 01:52:21.12
Joints.

1540
01:52:21.12 --> 01:52:22.12
Crill oil.

1541
01:52:22.12 --> 01:52:22.12
Super.

1542
01:52:22.12 --> 01:52:23.12
Crill.

1543
01:52:23.12 --> 01:52:24.12
This is what it's called.

1544
01:52:24.12 --> 01:52:25.12
Joint warfare.

1545
01:52:25.12 --> 01:52:27.12
Discipline.

1546
01:52:27.12 --> 01:52:28.12
Mm-hmm.

1547
01:52:28.12 --> 01:52:29.12
Discipline.

1548
01:52:29.12 --> 01:52:30.12
Discipline.

1549
01:52:30.12 --> 01:52:31.12
Go.

1550
01:52:31.12 --> 01:52:32.12
Moved.

1551
01:52:32.12 --> 01:52:33.12
All right.

1552
01:52:33.12 --> 01:52:35.12
Discipline.

1553
01:52:35.12 --> 01:52:36.12
I'll tell you two minutes.

1554
01:52:36.12 --> 01:52:37.12
No.

1555
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.12
I'll tell you thirty seconds.

1556
01:52:38.12 --> 01:52:39.12
Discipline.

1557
01:52:39.12 --> 01:52:40.12
Cognitive.

1558
01:52:40.12 --> 01:52:41.12
And physical.

1559
01:52:41.12 --> 01:52:43.12
And hands are drink.

1560
01:52:43.12 --> 01:52:44.12
Right?

1561
01:52:44.12 --> 01:52:45.12
I really like it.

1562
01:52:45.12 --> 01:52:47.12
I like the way it makes me feel.

1563
01:52:47.12 --> 01:52:50.12
I, for living.

1564
01:52:50.12 --> 01:52:55.12
One of my jobs is to talk to companies and talk about leadership and getting the game and do podcast.

1565
01:52:55.12 --> 01:52:58.12
I'm going to get, you know, mentally in the game.

1566
01:52:58.12 --> 01:52:59.12
Yes.

1567
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:04.12
But going on, talking to a company where I'm going to be up, you know, on stage for two hours.

1568
01:53:04.12 --> 01:53:05.12
Mm-hmm.

1569
01:53:05.12 --> 01:53:08.12
If I'm pounding some drink beforehand,

1570
01:53:08.12 --> 01:53:10.12
Guess what's going to happen, you know,

1571
01:53:10.12 --> 01:53:11.12
48 minutes in.

1572
01:53:11.12 --> 01:53:12.12
I got to use the restroom.

1573
01:53:12.12 --> 01:53:13.12
I don't like use the restroom.

1574
01:53:13.12 --> 01:53:14.12
That's a sign of weakness.

1575
01:53:14.12 --> 01:53:15.12
Yeah.

1576
01:53:15.12 --> 01:53:16.12
Yeah.

1577
01:53:16.12 --> 01:53:17.12
So I talked to Pete Brian.

1578
01:53:17.12 --> 01:53:21.12
I was like, hey, we need to take what's in discipline and put it in a pill.

1579
01:53:21.12 --> 01:53:25.12
So I could just eat it and don't have to use the restroom.

1580
01:53:25.12 --> 01:53:27.12
48 minutes after I start talking to a company.

1581
01:53:27.12 --> 01:53:29.12
That's where discipline go came from.

1582
01:53:29.12 --> 01:53:30.12
And it's awesome.

1583
01:53:30.12 --> 01:53:31.12
Yeah.

1584
01:53:31.12 --> 01:53:32.12
So.

1585
01:53:32.12 --> 01:53:34.12
And not to mention, you don't got to do the whole, which I don't mind by the way.

1586
01:53:34.12 --> 01:53:36.12
I do like the ritual, but the whole thing.

1587
01:53:36.12 --> 01:53:39.12
So you got to put in the water and the mix and the whatever, you know, that stuff.

1588
01:53:39.12 --> 01:53:41.12
You just, if you're on the go.

1589
01:53:41.12 --> 01:53:42.12
There you go.

1590
01:53:42.12 --> 01:53:43.12
That's why the discipline go.

1591
01:53:43.12 --> 01:53:50.12
And we actually speaking of mixing, we are going to, we have a, we have discipline in a can coming out.

1592
01:53:50.12 --> 01:53:51.12
Yeah.

1593
01:53:51.12 --> 01:53:53.12
Which you won't have to mix.

1594
01:53:53.12 --> 01:53:55.12
You'll just crack it open.

1595
01:53:55.12 --> 01:53:56.12
Crack it open.

1596
01:53:56.12 --> 01:53:57.12
That's good.

1597
01:53:57.12 --> 01:53:58.12
Kind of.

1598
01:53:58.12 --> 01:54:01.12
And then, Mark, of course, if you need additional protein, this way to get it.

1599
01:54:01.12 --> 01:54:03.12
Best way to get it.

1600
01:54:03.12 --> 01:54:04.12
Most pleasurable.

1601
01:54:04.12 --> 01:54:06.12
The most delicious way to get it.

1602
01:54:06.12 --> 01:54:09.12
Delicious way to get it in chocolate.

1603
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:12.12
I think a rib eye is an equally delicious.

1604
01:54:12.12 --> 01:54:16.12
Although it's different because I'm telling you, this, this makes me mad when I'm on the road.

1605
01:54:16.12 --> 01:54:20.12
And I go get a nice rib eye and I'm totally happy, but I'm not.

1606
01:54:20.12 --> 01:54:22.12
I'm not totally happy.

1607
01:54:22.12 --> 01:54:24.12
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 96% happy.

1608
01:54:24.12 --> 01:54:25.12
But I want something.

1609
01:54:25.12 --> 01:54:28.12
I want a little, I want a little, a little, a little, a little.

1610
01:54:28.12 --> 01:54:29.12
Yeah.

1611
01:54:29.12 --> 01:54:32.12
You don't just try to close the deal on my palate.

1612
01:54:32.12 --> 01:54:35.12
And I want something tasty.

1613
01:54:35.12 --> 01:54:36.12
Yeah.

1614
01:54:36.12 --> 01:54:37.12
What do they call it?

1615
01:54:37.12 --> 01:54:38.12
Savory.

1616
01:54:38.12 --> 01:54:39.12
My wife's favorite.

1617
01:54:39.12 --> 01:54:40.12
That's like salty, right?

1618
01:54:40.12 --> 01:54:42.12
What's, like, some sweet this sweet.

1619
01:54:42.12 --> 01:54:42.12
Yeah.

1620
01:54:42.12 --> 01:54:44.12
I have the savory rib eye.

1621
01:54:44.12 --> 01:54:46.12
And then I want to close the deal with a little bit of,

1622
01:54:46.12 --> 01:54:47.12
shhh.

1623
01:54:47.12 --> 01:54:48.12
Great.

1624
01:54:48.12 --> 01:54:49.12
Little bit of the mouth.

1625
01:54:49.12 --> 01:54:53.12
But don't, well, if you were like, hey, I want some additional protein.

1626
01:54:53.12 --> 01:54:58.12
You don't go rib eye because rib eye you get additional protein additional whatever else nutrients in them.

1627
01:54:58.12 --> 01:54:59.12
Which is cool.

1628
01:54:59.12 --> 01:55:03.12
But if you just want additional protein, more isolated.

1629
01:55:03.12 --> 01:55:04.12
Yeah.

1630
01:55:04.12 --> 01:55:05.12
Boom, get the milk.

1631
01:55:05.12 --> 01:55:08.12
Plus the sweet pleasure for the palate.

1632
01:55:08.12 --> 01:55:13.12
And if you just kids, and it's hot, look, we got a problem in America.

1633
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:14.12
I'll just throw it out there.

1634
01:55:14.12 --> 01:55:16.12
We got kids that are just not eaten correct.

1635
01:55:16.12 --> 01:55:18.12
They're out of shape.

1636
01:55:18.12 --> 01:55:18.12
Yeah.

1637
01:55:18.12 --> 01:55:20.12
So what do you do?

1638
01:55:20.12 --> 01:55:23.12
Well, what do you want to get them something that tastes good to eat?

1639
01:55:23.12 --> 01:55:24.12
What do tastes good to eat?

1640
01:55:24.12 --> 01:55:25.12
Candy bars?

1641
01:55:25.12 --> 01:55:26.12
Yeah.

1642
01:55:26.12 --> 01:55:27.12
What else tastes good to eat?

1643
01:55:27.12 --> 01:55:28.12
Ice cream?

1644
01:55:28.12 --> 01:55:29.12
What else tastes good to eat?

1645
01:55:29.12 --> 01:55:30.12
Cheetos?

1646
01:55:30.12 --> 01:55:31.12
Yeah.

1647
01:55:31.12 --> 01:55:32.12
Guess what?

1648
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:33.12
Those are all bad for you.

1649
01:55:33.12 --> 01:55:35.12
Good guess what else tastes good to eat?

1650
01:55:35.12 --> 01:55:37.12

Where you're good, mole?

1653
01:55:39.12 --> 01:55:42.12
To drink, would you say eat?

1654
01:55:42.12 --> 01:55:43.12
Drink.

1655
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:47.12
Yeah, it's to drink, but I mean, if you mix it thick, you got your stuff a little bit.

1656
01:55:47.12 --> 01:55:48.12
Jumping on that.

1657
01:55:48.12 --> 01:55:49.12
You put some basically food.

1658
01:55:49.12 --> 01:55:51.12
It's coconut shards in there.

1659
01:55:51.12 --> 01:55:52.12
Yeah.

1660
01:55:52.12 --> 01:55:53.12
Ice cream.

1661
01:55:53.12 --> 01:55:55.12
You didn't think what that would be like that one.

1662
01:55:55.12 --> 01:55:56.12
Coconut shards.

1663
01:55:56.12 --> 01:55:57.12

A subtle way.

1702
01:57:03.12 --> 01:57:04.12
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, it's a good reason.

1718
01:57:23.12 --> 01:57:24.12
I got the reason to tell anyway.

Equal.

1731
01:57:39.12 --> 01:57:40.12
Don't discriminate against the Flex fit.

1732
01:57:40.12 --> 01:57:41.12
They're equal.

1733
01:57:41.12 --> 01:57:42.12

In the can, preferred by me.

1745
01:57:56.12 --> 01:57:57.12
But if you like to seep.

1746
01:57:57.12 --> 01:57:59.12
It's a steeper steeper steeper steep.

1747
01:57:59.12 --> 01:58:00.12

01:58:04.12 --> 01:58:05.12
Seating.

1753
01:58:05.12 --> 01:58:07.12
Like something's being saved out of the leaking.

1754
01:58:07.12 --> 01:58:08.12
Yeah.

1755
01:58:08.12 --> 01:58:09.12
Yeah.

1756
01:58:09.12 --> 01:58:10.12
So we're not leaking.

This true.

1775

I know I just added that as like a little.

1776
01:58:31.12 --> 01:58:32.12
Dang.

1777
01:58:32.12 --> 01:58:33.12

They're new podcast.

1788
01:58:47.12 --> 01:58:48.12
Yeah.

1789
01:58:48.12 --> 01:58:50.12
Say hey, put your podcast on our app.

1790
01:58:50.12 --> 01:58:51.12
Doesn't that happen automatically?

1791
01:58:51.12 --> 01:58:52.12
Some.

1792
01:58:52.12 --> 01:58:53.12
Yeah.

1793
01:58:53.12 --> 01:58:54.12
Some.

1794
01:58:54.12 --> 01:58:55.12
Apparently.

1795
01:58:55.12 --> 01:58:57.12
Because they're asking me to do it.

1796
01:58:57.12 --> 01:59:02.12
And don't forget about the warrior kid podcast of which we just released a couple more.

1797
01:59:02.12 --> 01:59:05.12
Just 20 and 21 alive,

1798
01:59:05.12 --> 01:59:05.12
Mm.

1799
01:59:05.12 --> 01:59:06.12
Here.

1800
01:59:06.12 --> 01:59:07.12
Some questions for Uncle Jake.

1801
01:59:07.12 --> 01:59:10.12
And there's some stories from Uncle Jake,

1802
01:59:10.12 --> 01:59:13.12
him explaining how he got his.

1803
01:59:13.12 --> 01:59:16.12
Of use in life through stories.

1804
01:59:16.12 --> 01:59:17.12
Also got YouTube.

1805
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:20.12
Don't forget about YouTube.

1806
01:59:20.12 --> 01:59:28.04
You tube is where you can see this video of this podcast and then you can see cool videos

1807
01:59:28.04 --> 01:59:34.000
from echo Charles that he makes on his computer thing.

1808
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.80
And you can check his style and give him feedback if he went too far.

1809
01:59:40.80 --> 01:59:47.44
I think there's some videos that violate good taste.

1810
01:59:47.44 --> 01:59:51.18
There's only one really. It is Christmas.

1811
01:59:51.18 --> 01:59:53.48
Christmas is coming out.

1812
01:59:53.48 --> 01:59:56.14
I'm going to repost it.

1813
01:59:56.14 --> 01:59:59.42
I'm going to remind everyone that he's still alive.

1814
01:59:59.42 --> 02:00:00.62
Oh, it's life.

1815
02:00:00.62 --> 02:00:03.82
In fact, people have been contacting me.

1816
02:00:03.82 --> 02:00:04.82
Say they appreciate it.

1817
02:00:04.82 --> 02:00:05.82
Where's that war path?

1818
02:00:05.82 --> 02:00:07.42
Is it called a war path?

1819
02:00:07.42 --> 02:00:10.02
No Christmas videos called the war path.

1820
02:00:10.02 --> 02:00:11.02
You need to introduce them.

1821
02:00:11.02 --> 02:00:12.78
What's the other one called revised?

1822
02:00:12.78 --> 02:00:15.02
Because it made a good one.

1823
02:00:15.02 --> 02:00:18.02
The one without Christmas.

1824
02:00:18.02 --> 02:00:20.52
Music and slight variation.

1825
02:00:20.52 --> 02:00:22.82
Anyway, thanks, bro.

1826
02:00:22.82 --> 02:00:25.16

02:00:25.16 --> 02:00:26.16
Nonetheless.

1828
02:00:26.16 --> 02:00:29.16
That song is right up there with your podcast table.

1829
02:00:29.16 --> 02:00:34.36

1830
02:00:34.36 --> 02:00:35.36
Just saying.

1831
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:36.36
Just saying.

1832
02:00:36.36 --> 02:00:38.92
I think there's psychological warfare which is an album with tracks and it will kind

1833
02:00:38.92 --> 02:00:42.08
of help you get through some more rough moments of weakness.

1834
02:00:42.08 --> 02:00:43.38
More than kind of.

Help you a lot. 100% proven by echo.

1836
02:00:45.90 --> 02:00:47.54
Who's has some moments of weakness?

1837
02:00:47.54 --> 02:00:48.82
I have moments of weakness for sure.

1838
02:00:48.82 --> 02:00:49.62
The other comes.

1839
02:00:49.62 --> 02:00:51.62
Yes, especially with the stuff you're talking about.

1840
02:00:51.62 --> 02:00:57.10
I mean, not so much with the eating doughnuts thing, but like waking up or getting

1841
02:00:57.10 --> 02:00:58.10
up.

1842
02:00:58.10 --> 02:01:02.34
Like, you know, that's a deep history.

1843
02:01:02.34 --> 02:01:05.74
If I don't have to wake up for something specific, like, you know, you'll be like,

1844
02:01:05.74 --> 02:01:07.14
hey, I got to get up because I got it.

1845
02:01:07.14 --> 02:01:13.30
I can't even remember what it's like to have my wise open up in the more

1846
02:01:13.30 --> 02:01:16.54
morning and not feel the fire.

1847
02:01:16.54 --> 02:01:18.82
I'm just like, not I'm not talking.

1848
02:01:18.82 --> 02:01:21.82
I'm not talking like, I'm not trying to say I wake up in the morning.

1849
02:01:21.82 --> 02:01:23.54
I have this internal fire.

1850
02:01:23.54 --> 02:01:26.58
I'm talking about the heat from external sources of.

1851
02:01:26.58 --> 02:01:28.82
Dang, I got to do.

1852
02:01:28.82 --> 02:01:29.82
Right.

1853
02:01:29.82 --> 02:01:30.82
Yeah.

1854
02:01:30.82 --> 02:01:35.18
So I'm going to you the connoisseur of comfort echo.

1855
02:01:35.18 --> 02:01:36.02
Yes.

1856
02:01:36.02 --> 02:01:38.66
Often wake up and say, hmm.

1857
02:01:38.66 --> 02:01:39.66
Yeah.

1858
02:01:39.66 --> 02:01:42.06
So you know, all's good.

1859
02:01:42.06 --> 02:01:43.06
You're going to go off.

1860
02:01:43.06 --> 02:01:44.06
No, ho, ho.

1861
02:01:44.06 --> 02:01:47.14
Well, thanks for helping me.

1862
02:01:47.14 --> 02:01:49.10
How about that and skipping workouts too.

1863
02:01:49.10 --> 02:01:50.62
Thanks for helping me with that.

1864
02:01:50.62 --> 02:01:52.82
Not skipping, post-pony.

1865
02:01:52.82 --> 02:01:53.82
That's the problem.

1866
02:01:53.82 --> 02:01:54.82
Post-pony workouts.

1867
02:01:54.82 --> 02:01:55.82
That's the same thing.

1868
02:01:55.82 --> 02:01:56.82
Keep it a workout.

1869
02:01:56.82 --> 02:01:57.82
No, that's a psycho thing.

1870
02:01:57.82 --> 02:01:59.82
I'm just going to, I'm just going to not do it.

1871
02:01:59.82 --> 02:02:01.90
If you don't do a workout, it doesn't get postponed.

1872
02:02:01.90 --> 02:02:02.90
It just got skipped.

1873
02:02:02.90 --> 02:02:05.54
No, but no, well, yeah, no, it does get postponed.

1874
02:02:05.54 --> 02:02:07.86
Cause look, if I'm going to do it, it's the experiment.

1875
02:02:07.86 --> 02:02:09.86
This is what, you know, if I'm going to do that, you know, and I'm going to run.

1876
02:02:09.86 --> 02:02:10.86
There's an happening.

1877
02:02:10.86 --> 02:02:11.86
Okay.

1878
02:02:11.86 --> 02:02:12.86
No.

1879
02:02:12.86 --> 02:02:13.86
Okay, then you lost it.

1880
02:02:13.86 --> 02:02:14.86
Yeah, I'm going to get it back.

1881
02:02:14.86 --> 02:02:15.86
Okay, I get it.

1882
02:02:15.86 --> 02:02:16.86
Actually, you're right.

1883
02:02:16.86 --> 02:02:19.42
Cause look, my workout goes day one, day two, day three, day four, day five.

1884
02:02:19.42 --> 02:02:22.66
Like in days, it's by day is what I'm saying.

1885
02:02:22.66 --> 02:02:24.74
So if I skip, we're going to make a book of your workout.

1886
02:02:24.74 --> 02:02:25.74
How's that?

1887
02:02:25.74 --> 02:02:26.74
Yeah.

1888
02:02:26.74 --> 02:02:28.86
I have, I have, I made it long time ago.

1889
02:02:28.86 --> 02:02:32.10
I used to get into my name as the book is going to be out.

1890
02:02:32.10 --> 02:02:37.54
Get chacked with seven A's in the jacked.

1891
02:02:37.54 --> 02:02:38.54
All right.

1892
02:02:38.54 --> 02:02:39.54
Who's not going to buy that?

1893
02:02:39.54 --> 02:02:41.54
Oh, jacked by those girls.

1894
02:02:41.54 --> 02:02:43.06
Nobody, everybody's going to buy it.

1895
02:02:43.06 --> 02:02:46.30
Apparently, it's nonetheless kettle bell curls.

1896
02:02:46.30 --> 02:02:48.54
Back to a barbell curls.

1897
02:02:48.54 --> 02:02:49.54
Sam Bag Curl.

1898
02:02:49.54 --> 02:02:52.54
It's you do day two on day three, you skip day two.

1899
02:02:52.54 --> 02:02:55.66
You went to day three just because you reformulated the movements on day three.

1900
02:02:55.66 --> 02:02:58.62
It doesn't, doesn't negate the fact that you skipped it.

1901
02:02:58.62 --> 02:02:59.62
No skipping workout.

1902
02:02:59.62 --> 02:03:00.62
No skipping workout.

1903
02:03:00.62 --> 02:03:01.62
You won't do it anymore.

1904
02:03:01.62 --> 02:03:02.62
Psychological warfare.

1905
02:03:02.62 --> 02:03:04.86

No, yes, you got some socks and some other cool items.

1911
02:03:16.46 --> 02:03:18.46

02:03:31.18 --> 02:03:32.18
Yeah.

1919
02:03:32.18 --> 02:03:36.86
Well, my daughter uses lines from my kid in the dream.

1920
02:03:36.86 --> 02:03:42.74
Jamie just sent me a video of her daughter getting ready to go get a shot.

1921
02:03:42.74 --> 02:03:45.46
So that yeah, I watched that video with my daughter too.

1922
02:03:45.46 --> 02:03:46.82
She can be both enjoyed.

1923
02:03:46.82 --> 02:03:47.82
Yeah, talking about.

1924
02:03:47.82 --> 02:03:48.82
She's gonna be brave.

1925
02:03:48.82 --> 02:03:49.82
Yeah, yeah.

1926
02:03:49.82 --> 02:03:51.46
Actually, she says I'm gonna be pretty brave.

1927
02:03:51.46 --> 02:03:52.46
I don't know.

1928
02:03:52.46 --> 02:03:53.46
She's pretty.

1929
02:03:53.46 --> 02:03:54.46
She goes, oh, scared.

1930
02:03:54.46 --> 02:03:55.46
Last but not.

1931
02:03:55.46 --> 02:03:57.34
But this time I'm gonna be brave.

1932
02:03:57.34 --> 02:03:58.34
Pretty much.

1933
02:03:58.34 --> 02:04:01.02
But she's there.

1934
02:04:01.02 --> 02:04:03.22
I mean, this is story about how I feel how old she is.

1935
02:04:03.22 --> 02:04:04.50
But she's talking about Mikey in the dragon.

1936
02:04:04.50 --> 02:04:08.14
You can understand this. You can understand that how you can overcome your fears.

1937
02:04:08.14 --> 02:04:09.74
Mikey in the Dragons.

1938
02:04:09.74 --> 02:04:10.74
Sorry, it was out of stock.

1939
02:04:10.74 --> 02:04:14.18
But we in stock now, boy, we got plenty of stock.

1940
02:04:14.18 --> 02:04:18.34
So order one for you order one for be like Sarah in order 10.

1941
02:04:18.34 --> 02:04:21.38
Be like Andrew Paul in order 20.

1942
02:04:21.38 --> 02:04:22.38
Oh, you.

1943
02:04:22.38 --> 02:04:27.26
Yeah, I think it was Sarah was making fun of my math.

1944
02:04:27.26 --> 02:04:29.70
The jockel math is like, oh, Andrew's gonna order one.

1945
02:04:29.70 --> 02:04:30.70
Sarah's gonna order one.

1946
02:04:30.70 --> 02:04:31.70
Echo order one.

1947
02:04:31.70 --> 02:04:33.98
When it's really like, oh, Sarah's gonna order 10.

1948
02:04:33.98 --> 02:04:36.22
You wonder why we went out of stock.

1949
02:04:36.22 --> 02:04:38.70
Anyways, we are fully in stock now.

1950
02:04:38.70 --> 02:04:41.30
We will not be out of stock again.

1951
02:04:41.30 --> 02:04:46.90
So Mikey in the Dragons get some and weigh the warrior kid.

1952
02:04:46.90 --> 02:04:48.90
Both weigh the warrior kid one and two.

1953
02:04:48.90 --> 02:04:50.90
Number two is called Mark Smithian.

1954
02:04:50.90 --> 02:04:52.78
Number three is coming out in the spring.

1955
02:04:52.78 --> 02:04:55.54
I will get it up for pre-order.

1956
02:04:55.54 --> 02:04:58.98
And believe me, I understand now why we pre-order books.

1957
02:04:58.98 --> 02:04:59.98
Yeah.

1958
02:04:59.98 --> 02:05:02.78
I kind of made that mistake with Mikey in the Dragons.

1959
02:05:02.78 --> 02:05:06.54
You will all please pre-order when I put it up so that I know how many I'm gonna print

1960
02:05:06.54 --> 02:05:08.54
or at least a decent estimate.

1961
02:05:08.54 --> 02:05:12.94
And I'll take Sarah's order and multiply it times 10.

1962
02:05:12.94 --> 02:05:18.26
I'll set aside 10 for her in 20 for Andrew Paul and everybody else at ordered stacks of those

1963
02:05:18.26 --> 02:05:19.26
books.

1964
02:05:19.26 --> 02:05:20.26
So appreciate it.

1965
02:05:20.26 --> 02:05:22.30
Despernacles freedom field manual.

1966
02:05:22.30 --> 02:05:23.30
How to get after it.

02:05:23.30 --> 02:05:24.30
Yeah.

1968
02:05:24.30 --> 02:05:25.30
New years.

1969
02:05:25.30 --> 02:05:27.30
Everyone's on their big rev.

1970
02:05:27.30 --> 02:05:28.30
Was it resolutions?

1971
02:05:28.30 --> 02:05:29.30
Revolution?

1972
02:05:29.30 --> 02:05:30.30
Revolution?

1973
02:05:30.30 --> 02:05:31.30
Both.

1974
02:05:31.30 --> 02:05:32.30
Revolution?

1975
02:05:32.30 --> 02:05:33.30
Sure.

1976
02:05:33.30 --> 02:05:34.30
Yeah.

1977
02:05:34.30 --> 02:05:35.30
Post the discipline.

1978
02:05:35.30 --> 02:05:38.70
Because you can't just say, well tomorrow I'm gonna, you know, on January 1st, I'm

1979
02:05:38.70 --> 02:05:39.70
gonna change of no.

1980
02:05:39.70 --> 02:05:40.70
Yeah.

1981
02:05:40.70 --> 02:05:43.86
Today, yeah, between no and then I'm gonna keep slacking and whatever.

1982
02:05:43.86 --> 02:05:45.20
That's kind of what you're saying.

1983
02:05:45.20 --> 02:05:46.20
That is what you're saying.

1984
02:05:46.20 --> 02:05:47.20
That is what you're saying.

1985
02:05:47.20 --> 02:05:48.20
I'm way of slacking too.

1986
02:05:48.20 --> 02:05:49.20
Yeah.

1987
02:05:49.20 --> 02:05:50.20
You can just get in the game right now.

1988
02:05:50.20 --> 02:05:51.20
Extreme ownership.

1989
02:05:51.20 --> 02:05:56.36
Obviously, reverence that a bunch today and get the dichotomy of leadership so that

1990
02:05:56.36 --> 02:06:03.36
you don't just get one perspective and forget about the dichotomy you need the dichotomy

1991
02:06:03.36 --> 02:06:06.96
in your world as a leader.

1992
02:06:06.96 --> 02:06:07.96
Ashland front.

1993
02:06:07.96 --> 02:06:09.40
That's my leadership consultancy.

1994
02:06:09.40 --> 02:06:11.64
We saw problems through leadership.

1995
02:06:11.64 --> 02:06:18.24
We will come into your company, assess and align your team so that they dominate.

1996
02:06:18.24 --> 02:06:20.68
Go to echelonfront.com for details.

1997
02:06:20.68 --> 02:06:21.68
Yes.

1998
02:06:21.68 --> 02:06:22.68
Also the master.

1999
02:06:22.68 --> 02:06:23.68
Hmm.

2000
02:06:23.68 --> 02:06:24.68
2019.

2001
02:06:24.68 --> 02:06:26.68
I will say.

2002
02:06:26.68 --> 02:06:31.28
10th of October and Sidney, Australia.

2003
02:06:31.28 --> 02:06:32.68
Juck will be at all of them.

2004
02:06:32.68 --> 02:06:33.68
Yeah.

2005
02:06:33.68 --> 02:06:34.68
I will.

2006
02:06:34.68 --> 02:06:36.48
I will be live and I will be getting it.

2007
02:06:36.48 --> 02:06:37.48
They've also told out.

2008
02:06:37.48 --> 02:06:40.88
So if you think it well, you know, I'll just, I'm waiting to see.

2009
02:06:40.88 --> 02:06:41.88
Yeah.

2010
02:06:41.88 --> 02:06:42.88
Don't get sick.

2011
02:06:42.88 --> 02:06:44.88
Didn't look up.

2012
02:06:44.88 --> 02:06:48.88
We are doing a podcast live.

2013
02:06:48.88 --> 02:06:49.88
Live podcast.

2014
02:06:49.88 --> 02:06:51.28
In New York City.

2015
02:06:51.28 --> 02:06:52.88
January 9th.

2016
02:06:52.88 --> 02:06:56.88
I will post the tickets as soon as they're available.

2017
02:06:56.88 --> 02:07:02.88
If you haven't seen them yet, check my social media platforms.

2018
02:07:02.88 --> 02:07:05.08
It's to get insta-

2019
02:07:05.08 --> 02:07:07.08
Twitter, Twitter.

2020
02:07:07.08 --> 02:07:08.08
Please, people.

2021
02:07:08.08 --> 02:07:09.08
Wow.

2022
02:07:09.08 --> 02:07:11.80
So you set that data side.

2023
02:07:11.80 --> 02:07:13.44
It's a Wednesday night.

2024
02:07:13.44 --> 02:07:14.44
It's a New York City.

2025
02:07:14.44 --> 02:07:16.000
It's in a nice cinema.

2026
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
A nice theater theater.

2027
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
We'll look.

2028
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.20
It has the red velvet seats.

2029
02:07:21.20 --> 02:07:22.20
Right?

2030
02:07:22.20 --> 02:07:23.20
They'll indicate if they're.

2031
02:07:23.20 --> 02:07:26.52
They also sometimes people say they're like, did you ever think you'd be a children's

2032
02:07:26.52 --> 02:07:27.52
author?

2033
02:07:27.52 --> 02:07:31.36
Or they'll say like, hey, did you ever think you'd be, you know, speaking to groups?

2034
02:07:31.36 --> 02:07:33.16
And I'm always like, whatever.

2035
02:07:33.16 --> 02:07:34.16
I don't know.

2036
02:07:34.16 --> 02:07:37.40
I'm like, maybe they're like writing.

2037
02:07:37.40 --> 02:07:41.40
But if they said, hey, would you ever think you're going to be speaking in a symphony

2038
02:07:41.40 --> 02:07:43.40
hall with red velvet seats?

2039
02:07:43.40 --> 02:07:44.40
I'd say you're excited.

2040
02:07:44.40 --> 02:07:45.40
I'm excited.

2041
02:07:45.40 --> 02:07:46.40
I'm excited.

2042
02:07:46.40 --> 02:07:47.40
But I am.

2043
02:07:47.40 --> 02:07:48.40
And so were you?

2044
02:07:48.40 --> 02:07:49.40
There you go.

2045
02:07:49.40 --> 02:07:50.40
Whether you like it or not.

2046
02:07:50.40 --> 02:07:51.40
So there's that.

2047
02:07:51.40 --> 02:07:54.40
Want the new EF online.

2048
02:07:54.40 --> 02:07:55.40
EF online.

2049
02:07:55.40 --> 02:07:58.96
So I guess I have to explain a little bit.

2050
02:07:58.96 --> 02:08:00.24
We have the master.

2051
02:08:00.24 --> 02:08:05.16
We have the echelon front where we go and work with companies.

2052
02:08:05.16 --> 02:08:11.52
At the master, you travel and you go and it is a pretty high price point.

2053
02:08:11.52 --> 02:08:13.88
Some companies have a lot of people.

2054
02:08:13.88 --> 02:08:17.20
Some people have smaller budgets.

2055
02:08:17.20 --> 02:08:22.04
Because we recognize some companies asked us, hey, we want you to train everyone in our

2056
02:08:22.04 --> 02:08:23.04
company.

2057
02:08:23.04 --> 02:08:25.88
We have 150,000 employees.

2058
02:08:25.88 --> 02:08:29.44
And they're located dispersed around the globe.

2059
02:08:29.44 --> 02:08:31.12
Can you get that done for us?

2060
02:08:31.12 --> 02:08:33.72
This is one of those things where it's like, no.

2061
02:08:33.72 --> 02:08:38.96
I can't, we can't get 250,000 people in a, you know, in a, in a short enough period

2062
02:08:38.96 --> 02:08:40.84
of time that it has the impact we want to deliver.

2063
02:08:40.84 --> 02:08:43.92
So with all that, how do we overcome this barrier?

2064
02:08:43.92 --> 02:08:45.24
We go to technology.

2065
02:08:45.24 --> 02:08:48.92
So we've created online leadership training course.

2066
02:08:48.92 --> 02:08:52.16
It's called EF online.

2067
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:56.48
It's going to be available through direct consumer if somebody will just want, like

2068
02:08:56.48 --> 02:08:59.96
friends, and let's say you can't go to the master for whatever reason.

2069
02:08:59.96 --> 02:09:05.88
This is a virtual, I guess it's a virtual master.

2070
02:09:05.88 --> 02:09:10.24
Or it's a similar assimilation.

2071
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:12.88
That's not saying, yeah, that's what it is.

2072
02:09:12.88 --> 02:09:17.96
The original idea for me was you go to the master without having to go.

2073
02:09:17.96 --> 02:09:22.68
You get that information, get that interactivity without actually having to go to the

2074
02:09:22.68 --> 02:09:24.000
master.

2075
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So there you go.

2076
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.16
EF online and we made it for individuals.

2077
02:09:28.16 --> 02:09:29.72
We also have it for enterprise.

2078
02:09:29.72 --> 02:09:31.000
So we're now getting it.

2079
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:32.36
We already have it with our clients.

2080
02:09:32.36 --> 02:09:34.36
They're stoked on it.

2081
02:09:34.36 --> 02:09:41.96
And so EF online.com, it's going to be available to the masses New Year's Day.

2082
02:09:41.96 --> 02:09:45.16
Anyway, first, 2019.

2083
02:09:45.16 --> 02:09:51.36
And of course, there's EF over watch where we are connecting proven leaders from spec ops

2084
02:09:51.36 --> 02:09:55.44
and combat aviation to companies in the civilian sector.

2085
02:09:55.44 --> 02:10:02.76
That need combat proven and tested leaders, experienced leaders to come in into their

2086
02:10:02.76 --> 02:10:08.44
organization with the principles of extreme ownership, with the principles of the dichotomy

2087
02:10:08.44 --> 02:10:12.000
of leadership and helping them lead and win.

2088
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.36
That's EF over watch.com, whether you're a talent seeker, a career seeker.

2089
02:10:18.36 --> 02:10:20.20
We are there for you.

2090
02:10:20.20 --> 02:10:26.16
And if you want to continue communicating with us, we can be found and we can be communicated

2091
02:10:26.16 --> 02:10:33.32
with on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram, and on that, page, eep.

2092
02:10:33.32 --> 02:10:40.08
Echos at Eko Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and finally, thanks to all our folks

2093
02:10:40.08 --> 02:10:43.20
out there in uniform.

2094
02:10:43.20 --> 02:10:47.52
That includes, of course, our military that protects us from foreign threats and here

2095
02:10:47.52 --> 02:10:53.92
at home, our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics and EMTs, correctional officers,

2096
02:10:53.92 --> 02:11:01.32
border patrol and all other first responders that keep us safe from evil doers.

2097
02:11:01.32 --> 02:11:09.48
And sometimes they keep us safe from the wrath of nature itself and everyone else out there.

2098
02:11:09.48 --> 02:11:17.32
Life can be hard in one of the hardest things that life can put you through is death, death

2099
02:11:17.32 --> 02:11:21.84
of someone you care about.

2100
02:11:21.84 --> 02:11:29.04
And when that happens, it is a reminder to all of us that the clock is ticking every day

2101
02:11:29.04 --> 02:11:33.08
and every day that we have here is precious.

2102
02:11:33.08 --> 02:11:43.08
So when death visits upon your life and tries to rip you apart and drown you in those

2103
02:11:43.08 --> 02:11:49.20
waves of sorrow, don't let it.

2104
02:11:49.20 --> 02:11:59.08
Live on, drive on and live on for those that you have lost and live your life to the upmost

2105
02:11:59.08 --> 02:12:08.04
by getting out there every day and getting after it.

2106
02:12:08.04 --> 02:12:22.28
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
