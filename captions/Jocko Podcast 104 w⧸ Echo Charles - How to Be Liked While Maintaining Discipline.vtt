00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.64
This is Jocco podcast number 104.

2
00:00:04.64 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40
Good evening, I come.

4
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.40
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.40 --> 00:00:13.20
We're going to go right into Q&A.

6
00:00:13.20 --> 00:00:15.08
I don't think there's anything to discuss.

7
00:00:15.08 --> 00:00:16.08
Let's do it.

8
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:17.08
Yeah, let's do it then.

9
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:18.08
It's Q&A time.

10
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:19.84
All right, question number one.

11
00:00:19.84 --> 00:00:23.76
You discuss leading and maneuvering up and down the chain of command.

12
00:00:23.76 --> 00:00:26.68
But what about laterally within your own peer group?

13
00:00:26.68 --> 00:00:31.66
With a competition for advancement is fiercest and your ability to set team objectives and

14
00:00:31.66 --> 00:00:35.32
implement some of the tools you discuss is limited.

15
00:00:35.32 --> 00:00:42.48
Okay, so you absolutely do have to lead laterally amongst your peers.

16
00:00:42.48 --> 00:00:49.64
And since you don't have rank or position, you have to do it another way.

17
00:00:49.64 --> 00:00:54.32
But wait a second, since you shouldn't use rank or position to lead people below you

18
00:00:54.32 --> 00:00:58.80
in the chain of command, and since you don't want to be led by someone that's throwing

19
00:00:58.80 --> 00:01:01.68
their rank and position around and guess what?

20
00:01:01.68 --> 00:01:06.40
You need to do the same type of leadership that you would use up and down the chain

21
00:01:06.40 --> 00:01:09.16
of command to lead your peers.

22
00:01:09.16 --> 00:01:10.40
So what does that mean?

23
00:01:10.40 --> 00:01:14.48
That means you help them when you can.

24
00:01:14.48 --> 00:01:16.04
You support what they're doing.

25
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:18.12
You try and build a relationship with them.

26
00:01:18.12 --> 00:01:19.12
That's what you try and do.

27
00:01:19.12 --> 00:01:23.56
Now this part of this that we're talking about, they're competitiveness.

28
00:01:23.56 --> 00:01:28.32
But if they want to maneuver and try and make you look bad and jump in the spotlight and

29
00:01:28.32 --> 00:01:30.36
try and get all the credit, guess what?

30
00:01:30.36 --> 00:01:31.72
That's fine.

31
00:01:31.72 --> 00:01:32.96
That's fine.

32
00:01:32.96 --> 00:01:35.88
Let them do it.

33
00:01:35.88 --> 00:01:39.16
And everyone is going to see what they're doing.

34
00:01:39.16 --> 00:01:43.16
And they might not see it immediately, but they will eventually be found out.

35
00:01:43.16 --> 00:01:45.72
So do your best to support them.

36
00:01:45.72 --> 00:01:47.000
Do your best to help them.

37
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Do your best to build the relationship.

38
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.92
Make the mission the most important thing, not the little politics that you're about to

39
00:01:54.92 --> 00:01:56.80
dive into and get involved in.

40
00:01:56.80 --> 00:02:02.32
Don't make that the primary thing, make the primary thing, accomplishing the mission.

41
00:02:02.32 --> 00:02:03.32
Think about this.

42
00:02:03.32 --> 00:02:08.24
If you start fighting with them, you're expanding energy on fighting your own team.

43
00:02:08.24 --> 00:02:09.24
That's what you're doing.

44
00:02:09.24 --> 00:02:12.04
Instead of fighting the enemy, this is a blue on blue situation.

45
00:02:12.04 --> 00:02:13.04
This is friendly fire.

46
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:14.04
It's fratricide.

47
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:15.32
Don't do that.

48
00:02:15.32 --> 00:02:19.96
Disengage from the friendly fire and focus on how to make the team win.

49
00:02:19.96 --> 00:02:24.60
Take the high ground.

50
00:02:24.60 --> 00:02:29.20
Take the high ground or the high ground will take you.

51
00:02:29.20 --> 00:02:31.20
Okay.

52
00:02:31.20 --> 00:02:35.56
Another one of those points that we always say, I know I do.

53
00:02:35.56 --> 00:02:37.48
I always think this way.

54
00:02:37.48 --> 00:02:38.48
People are watching, man.

55
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:39.48
They see that.

56
00:02:39.48 --> 00:02:40.48
They see that.

57
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:41.48
They see all that stuff.

58
00:02:41.48 --> 00:02:43.04
Let's play this game to the game where I play with it.

59
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:44.04
Who would you hire?

60
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:46.000
Who would you rather have working for you?

61
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.36
Who would you rather have working for you?

62
00:02:47.36 --> 00:02:49.92
The guy, the guy, oh, you got four guys.

63
00:02:49.92 --> 00:02:55.32
One guy is helping the other guys out, trying to help them with their mission.

64
00:02:55.32 --> 00:02:59.80
One guy, the other end of the spectrum, is undermining people and trying to make himself

65
00:02:59.80 --> 00:03:00.80
look good.

66
00:03:00.80 --> 00:03:02.08
Which guy are you going to promote?

67
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:04.32
All day long, you know who you're going to promote.

68
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:07.84
You're going to promote the guy that's trying to help the team win and not just look

69
00:03:07.84 --> 00:03:08.84
out for himself.

70
00:03:08.84 --> 00:03:09.84
Yep.

71
00:03:09.84 --> 00:03:10.84
Yeah, fully.

72
00:03:10.84 --> 00:03:16.92
And then it and consider that with not just your boss, but your peers as well.

73
00:03:16.92 --> 00:03:19.60
Even if there's competition, let's say everyone's competing.

74
00:03:19.60 --> 00:03:20.60
Yeah.

75
00:03:20.60 --> 00:03:25.32
And you're the guy who's jumping in the spotlight, always whatever versus the other guy

76
00:03:25.32 --> 00:03:27.12
who's always helping everyone.

77
00:03:27.12 --> 00:03:28.12
Right.

78
00:03:28.12 --> 00:03:30.60
Even if they're competing with you first of all, the guy who's jumping in the spotlight,

79
00:03:30.60 --> 00:03:33.32
he's going to get ostracized differently.

80
00:03:33.32 --> 00:03:34.32
Yes.

81
00:03:34.32 --> 00:03:36.52
So, man, yeah, they see that stuff, man.

82
00:03:36.52 --> 00:03:37.52
That goes socially too.

83
00:03:37.52 --> 00:03:38.52
You know what?

84
00:03:38.52 --> 00:03:41.36
No, answer me this.

85
00:03:41.36 --> 00:03:47.08
When someone sees the world this way, that means that I have a tendency to think that way,

86
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:49.20
that means that I might have a tendency to act this way.

87
00:03:49.20 --> 00:03:51.28
They've got to be especially cautious.

88
00:03:51.28 --> 00:03:53.56
If you're looking at everyone like, well, I'm trying to compete with that guy.

89
00:03:53.56 --> 00:03:55.12
I might be getting screwed over.

90
00:03:55.12 --> 00:03:58.32
If I let him get the spotlight right now.

91
00:03:58.32 --> 00:04:00.80
If that's the way you're thinking, that's the way you're acting.

92
00:04:00.80 --> 00:04:03.08
And if you're acting that way, everybody can see it.

93
00:04:03.08 --> 00:04:04.08
Yeah.

94
00:04:04.08 --> 00:04:05.08
It's no an act that way.

95
00:04:05.08 --> 00:04:06.80
Be a good team member.

96
00:04:06.80 --> 00:04:07.80
Yeah.

97
00:04:07.80 --> 00:04:09.08
The enemy is outside the wire.

98
00:04:09.08 --> 00:04:14.36
Yeah, that's a good one too, where the good news about that is, like, let's say you are

99
00:04:14.36 --> 00:04:15.36
acting that way.

100
00:04:15.36 --> 00:04:18.32
As long as you can admit it to yourself.

101
00:04:18.32 --> 00:04:21.44
Even if you do have those feelings inside, but you're like, hey, I don't want to act like that.

102
00:04:21.44 --> 00:04:23.24
And you start acting in a field.

103
00:04:23.24 --> 00:04:25.28
It's kind of against your feelings.

104
00:04:25.28 --> 00:04:29.28
And then you start acting that way slowly and slowly, your feelings kind of accommodate,

105
00:04:29.28 --> 00:04:30.96
where you don't feel that way anymore.

106
00:04:30.96 --> 00:04:31.96
You'll start to feel that way.

107
00:04:31.96 --> 00:04:34.88
Let's start to realize how you should act as a human being.

108
00:04:34.88 --> 00:04:35.88
Yeah.

109
00:04:35.88 --> 00:04:37.68
As a team member, as a leader, as a follower.

110
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:38.68
Yeah.

111
00:04:38.68 --> 00:04:40.68
You'll grow up, you'll mature, you'll be a good person.

112
00:04:40.68 --> 00:04:41.68
Feel the benefit.

113
00:04:41.68 --> 00:04:44.68
As opposed to just looking out for yourself, school and other team.

114
00:04:44.68 --> 00:04:45.68
Yeah.

115
00:04:45.68 --> 00:04:46.68
Once against me.

116
00:04:46.68 --> 00:04:47.68
Check.

117
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:49.08
Next question.

118
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:55.20
My duty to school is small, and I'm a white belt under three months.

119
00:04:55.20 --> 00:05:00.76
And they're typically two or three blues and maybe a purple belt in the class with us.

120
00:05:00.76 --> 00:05:06.04
When I train or spar with a blue and purple belt, I can win the advantage or submit them

121
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:07.60
more than half the time.

122
00:05:07.60 --> 00:05:09.92
They don't like me because of this.

123
00:05:09.92 --> 00:05:14.36
I like what my instructor is teaching, but I feel I need more of a challenge.

124
00:05:14.36 --> 00:05:18.16
Should I find more a more competitive school?

125
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:19.84
Your time is appreciated.

126
00:05:19.84 --> 00:05:23.60
Okay, so there's something very suspect going on.

127
00:05:23.60 --> 00:05:24.60
Yeah.

128
00:05:24.60 --> 00:05:28.60
There's something wrong with the school if you are a white belt that can submit blues and

129
00:05:28.60 --> 00:05:29.60
purples.

130
00:05:29.60 --> 00:05:30.60
Yeah.

131
00:05:30.60 --> 00:05:35.56
And I don't know whether or not maybe if you're 500 pounds or just a super athlete, if you're

132
00:05:35.56 --> 00:05:41.84
a normal person, even if you wrestled in high school, maybe even if you wrestled in college.

133
00:05:41.84 --> 00:05:44.72
Again, you've been training jiu-jitsu for three months.

134
00:05:44.72 --> 00:05:47.92
You should not be submitting purple belts.

135
00:05:47.92 --> 00:05:49.24
That should not be happening.

136
00:05:49.24 --> 00:05:56.92
Now, there's a small chance of tiny, tiny chance that there just be like so super cool.

137
00:05:56.92 --> 00:05:59.80
They're letting that, like they're saying, oh yeah, you know, oh that was good.

138
00:05:59.80 --> 00:06:03.04
You know, you caught me at my arm and there's giving it a year, just too dumb to realize

139
00:06:03.04 --> 00:06:04.04
that.

140
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:09.84
But since you're saying that they don't like you because you're submitting them,

141
00:06:09.84 --> 00:06:12.16
that's very unlikely that they're just super nice.

142
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:17.36
So I think you may actually be in a fraudulent situation where the school is not a proper

143
00:06:17.36 --> 00:06:18.36
school.

144
00:06:18.36 --> 00:06:25.92
And I haven't heard one of these in a while, but a white belt should not be on the regular

145
00:06:25.92 --> 00:06:31.36
submitting a blue belt and definitely a purple belt for any purple belts.

146
00:06:31.36 --> 00:06:37.72
If there's a massive size differential, it'd be an occasional occurrence, but on the regular

147
00:06:37.72 --> 00:06:38.72
shouldn't be happening.

148
00:06:38.72 --> 00:06:39.72
Yeah.

149
00:06:39.72 --> 00:06:40.72
Correct.

150
00:06:40.72 --> 00:06:49.20
Yeah, I mean, unless again, like there's maybe, maybe it's a small school, you know,

151
00:06:49.20 --> 00:06:53.20
there's, you know, a few people, maybe like some real old people or something like that.

152
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:55.64
Maybe this guy, I don't know how big he is.

153
00:06:55.64 --> 00:06:56.64
Yeah.

154
00:06:56.64 --> 00:06:59.36
But let's say he was too, I'm, I'm getting really specific here.

155
00:06:59.36 --> 00:07:00.36
What a piece.

156
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:02.48
Two, twenty, five.

157
00:07:02.48 --> 00:07:03.48
Solid.

158
00:07:03.48 --> 00:07:04.48
Six, two.

159
00:07:04.48 --> 00:07:10.16
Mayerman out of being a college wrestler.

160
00:07:10.16 --> 00:07:11.80
Okay.

161
00:07:11.80 --> 00:07:14.64
Learned a few jokes, guillotine.

162
00:07:14.64 --> 00:07:15.64
Yeah.

163
00:07:15.64 --> 00:07:16.64
Okay.

164
00:07:16.64 --> 00:07:17.64
He had an arm.

165
00:07:17.64 --> 00:07:18.64
Yeah.

166
00:07:18.64 --> 00:07:19.64
Our bar.

167
00:07:19.64 --> 00:07:20.64
Yeah.

168
00:07:20.64 --> 00:07:24.40
You know, because he's two twenty five college wrestler, six to, he knows basic submissions.

169
00:07:24.40 --> 00:07:26.08
That, that, that could be problematic.

170
00:07:26.08 --> 00:07:34.16
And then the rest of the people, there's maybe like a 65 year old, 135, 135 pounds.

171
00:07:34.16 --> 00:07:35.16
Yeah.

172
00:07:35.16 --> 00:07:44.76
You know, if there's no extreme, um, disparity between you and the other students, we have

173
00:07:44.76 --> 00:07:45.76
a problem.

174
00:07:45.76 --> 00:07:46.76
Yeah.

175
00:07:46.76 --> 00:07:50.76
If there's an extreme disparity, even then you should go look around because even if you're

176
00:07:50.76 --> 00:07:55.24
even if you're two hundred twenty five pounds, six foot two wrestling college, most

177
00:07:55.24 --> 00:07:58.48
purple belts should be able to handle you if you've only been trained for two months.

178
00:07:58.48 --> 00:07:59.48
Yes.

179
00:07:59.48 --> 00:08:00.48
Yes.

180
00:08:00.48 --> 00:08:01.48
Yeah.

181
00:08:01.48 --> 00:08:02.48
So.

182
00:08:02.48 --> 00:08:03.48
Yeah.

183
00:08:03.48 --> 00:08:06.08
And not to say my situation, so all the years proof.

184
00:08:06.08 --> 00:08:07.08
I'm not saying that.

185
00:08:07.08 --> 00:08:08.44
But just an example.

186
00:08:08.44 --> 00:08:13.56
I was two, when I started, I was two twenty five.

187
00:08:13.56 --> 00:08:16.52
I'd say when I really settled into it, I lost.

188
00:08:16.52 --> 00:08:19.56
I got down to about two fifteen to twenty.

189
00:08:19.56 --> 00:08:20.56
Oh.

190
00:08:20.56 --> 00:08:21.56
And I was a white belt.

191
00:08:21.56 --> 00:08:22.92
Over three months, by the way.

192
00:08:22.92 --> 00:08:24.16
And I rolled with this guy.

193
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:25.16
George was his name.

194
00:08:25.16 --> 00:08:26.16
You might remember him.

195
00:08:26.16 --> 00:08:27.16
Small teeny guy.

196
00:08:27.16 --> 00:08:28.16
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:28.16 --> 00:08:29.16
Yeah.

198
00:08:29.16 --> 00:08:30.16
Yeah.

199
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:31.16
Purple belt.

200
00:08:31.16 --> 00:08:32.16
No chance.

201
00:08:32.16 --> 00:08:33.16
I had with this guy.

202
00:08:33.16 --> 00:08:34.48
More than three months, by the way.

203
00:08:34.48 --> 00:08:36.24
This after I started competing in a big.

204
00:08:36.24 --> 00:08:37.24
No, George is good too.

205
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:38.24
Yeah.

206
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:39.24
Purple belt.

207
00:08:39.24 --> 00:08:40.24
He's the only taught me first.

208
00:08:40.24 --> 00:08:41.24
For sure.

209
00:08:41.24 --> 00:08:42.64
But yeah, no chance.

210
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:43.64
Purple belt like him.

211
00:08:43.64 --> 00:08:44.68
You have no chance against him.

212
00:08:44.68 --> 00:08:45.68
Yeah.

213
00:08:45.68 --> 00:08:46.68
But this is not a big guy.

214
00:08:46.68 --> 00:08:47.88
You know, he's six.

215
00:08:47.88 --> 00:08:50.92
I think you might be smaller than five six.

216
00:08:50.92 --> 00:08:51.92
He's a small.

217
00:08:51.92 --> 00:08:52.92
I liked.

218
00:08:52.92 --> 00:08:53.92
Yeah.

219
00:08:53.92 --> 00:08:54.92
That's a great example.

220
00:08:54.92 --> 00:08:56.92
That's a great example.

221
00:08:56.92 --> 00:08:57.92
Trying to think.

222
00:08:57.92 --> 00:09:03.12
I mean, when I started GJ2, I was two hundred and fifteen pounds.

223
00:09:03.12 --> 00:09:06.000
Well, it was bigger than two hundred and fifteen pounds.

224
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.32
And Dean was a blue belt.

225
00:09:09.32 --> 00:09:11.40
Just got his blue belt.

226
00:09:11.40 --> 00:09:13.64
And I had no chance.

227
00:09:13.64 --> 00:09:14.64
Yeah.

228
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:15.64
You know what I mean?

229
00:09:15.64 --> 00:09:16.64
Yeah.

230
00:09:16.64 --> 00:09:19.64
And by the way, I forgot to mention, Dean weighed 174 pounds.

231
00:09:19.64 --> 00:09:20.64
Yeah.

232
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:22.44
So yeah, it's very similar.

233
00:09:22.44 --> 00:09:26.92
Yeah, you'd have to like get the disparity between the two would boot up to be a lot

234
00:09:26.92 --> 00:09:27.92
a lot.

235
00:09:27.92 --> 00:09:29.92
So what do you think it is then?

236
00:09:29.92 --> 00:09:31.76
I think like it might be a fraudulent school.

237
00:09:31.76 --> 00:09:32.76
Like what?

238
00:09:32.76 --> 00:09:35.64
The instructor's not a real black belt.

239
00:09:35.64 --> 00:09:40.64
The instructor knows he's watched enough YouTube to show an arm lock and he can actually

240
00:09:40.64 --> 00:09:45.92
do it on the purple belt because he's a bigger and stronger or something.

241
00:09:45.92 --> 00:09:47.84
And he knows it a little bit better because it's facing it.

242
00:09:47.84 --> 00:09:52.64
If you're a, if you watched YouTube and you studied this hard as I could, as you

243
00:09:52.64 --> 00:09:57.56
could and you owned a school and you trained all the time, you could be a blue belt

244
00:09:57.56 --> 00:09:58.56
level.

245
00:09:58.56 --> 00:10:03.48
And then you can be the other blue belts that you taught.

246
00:10:03.48 --> 00:10:06.32
And then gave the blue belt because you gave yourself a black belt.

247
00:10:06.32 --> 00:10:07.48
That's probably what's going on.

248
00:10:07.48 --> 00:10:08.48
Yeah.

249
00:10:08.48 --> 00:10:09.48
That's crazy.

250
00:10:09.48 --> 00:10:13.56
Whoever this is hit me up again and tell me what your school is.

251
00:10:13.56 --> 00:10:14.56
Yeah.

252
00:10:14.56 --> 00:10:15.56
One face bookie.

253
00:10:15.56 --> 00:10:16.56
Wow.

254
00:10:16.56 --> 00:10:17.56
Yeah.

255
00:10:17.56 --> 00:10:18.56
Really this question.

256
00:10:18.56 --> 00:10:20.56
Once you do that and once you, you know, and I don't know.

257
00:10:20.56 --> 00:10:25.40
I mean, is that a, is that like a, is that a hard move to be like, hey, this is my

258
00:10:25.40 --> 00:10:27.44
school and put it out there.

259
00:10:27.44 --> 00:10:28.44
And here's my instructor.

260
00:10:28.44 --> 00:10:32.44
I mean, on one hand, you want to think if the instructor is legit, no, no, no, no, no, no,

261
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:33.44
that's what I would learn to know.

262
00:10:33.44 --> 00:10:36.68
I want to, if the, if the guy wasn't legit, I don't know what I do.

263
00:10:36.68 --> 00:10:37.68
I don't have a plan for that.

264
00:10:37.68 --> 00:10:40.92
But if the guy was legit, I'd come back on here and say, oh, here's the situation.

265
00:10:40.92 --> 00:10:41.92
Yeah.

266
00:10:41.92 --> 00:10:44.88
You found out that this is what's going on.

267
00:10:44.88 --> 00:10:45.88
Yeah.

268
00:10:45.88 --> 00:10:49.72
You are a six, two, two, one, eighty, five pound collegiate, anti double H ampian

269
00:10:49.72 --> 00:10:54.32
wrestler and you studied sombo or do you, like if somebody had sombo or do you know

270
00:10:54.32 --> 00:10:55.32
under their belt?

271
00:10:55.32 --> 00:10:56.32
Yep.

272
00:10:56.32 --> 00:10:58.52
You wouldn't even be asking this question if you had that under your belt because you

273
00:10:58.52 --> 00:10:59.52
know the answer.

274
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:00.52
Yeah, that's true, too.

275
00:11:00.52 --> 00:11:01.52
Yeah, man.

276
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:06.32
So yeah, I think, yeah, the chance of that is fair, it's a fair chance fraudulent situation.

277
00:11:06.32 --> 00:11:08.32
I haven't seen too many of those lately.

278
00:11:08.32 --> 00:11:09.32
Yeah, because that's a rare thing.

279
00:11:09.32 --> 00:11:11.32
Yeah, the internet can mop those up now.

280
00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:12.32
Yeah.

281
00:11:12.32 --> 00:11:13.32
Used to be all kinds of fraudulent schools.

282
00:11:13.32 --> 00:11:14.32
Yeah, it makes sense.

283
00:11:14.32 --> 00:11:15.72
I mean, think about it.

284
00:11:15.72 --> 00:11:17.32
The internet is all over everything.

285
00:11:17.32 --> 00:11:18.32
Oh, yeah.

286
00:11:18.32 --> 00:11:20.32
You get even a half-flate fraudulent person.

287
00:11:20.32 --> 00:11:21.32
Yeah.

288
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:22.32
It's like, okay, this guy, fraudulent.

289
00:11:22.32 --> 00:11:23.32
You know what I mean?

290
00:11:23.32 --> 00:11:26.32
He's like, man, you really tell to the coals.

291
00:11:26.32 --> 00:11:27.32
So I don't know.

292
00:11:27.32 --> 00:11:28.32
Maybe.

293
00:11:28.32 --> 00:11:29.32
To it up.

294
00:11:29.32 --> 00:11:30.32
Yeah.

295
00:11:30.32 --> 00:11:36.32
I was going to say, should we have some kind of thing on our website where we have

296
00:11:36.32 --> 00:11:40.32
if you're a legit school, like a jockel approved school?

297
00:11:40.32 --> 00:11:41.32
In theory.

298
00:11:41.32 --> 00:11:43.32
Is how many times a day do you get asked?

299
00:11:43.32 --> 00:11:45.32
I live in Tennessee, where she's right.

300
00:11:45.32 --> 00:11:46.32
I live in Chicago, where she's right.

301
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:49.32
How many times do you get asked that a day?

302
00:11:49.32 --> 00:11:50.32
Half.

303
00:11:50.32 --> 00:11:52.32
So every other day is that about that.

304
00:11:52.32 --> 00:11:54.32
I really get asked more than that.

305
00:11:54.32 --> 00:11:56.32
I get asked a lot more than you.

306
00:11:56.32 --> 00:12:00.32
Maybe not tons more, but definitely I get asked repeatedly.

307
00:12:00.32 --> 00:12:01.32
Yeah.

308
00:12:01.32 --> 00:12:02.32
Where's that train I live in?

309
00:12:02.32 --> 00:12:03.32
Jacksonville, Florida.

310
00:12:03.32 --> 00:12:05.32
Where's that train I live in?

311
00:12:05.32 --> 00:12:06.32
Whatever.

312
00:12:06.32 --> 00:12:07.32
You know, New Hampshire.

313
00:12:07.32 --> 00:12:09.32
Where's that train I live in?

314
00:12:09.32 --> 00:12:10.32
Salt Lake City, Utah.

315
00:12:10.32 --> 00:12:11.32
You know what I mean?

316
00:12:11.32 --> 00:12:12.32
People always ask.

317
00:12:12.32 --> 00:12:16.32
Yeah, the only risk with that is like, okay, so first off, we don't know all the schools.

318
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:18.32
We've been like, don't you know how to school?

319
00:12:18.32 --> 00:12:19.32
Yeah.

320
00:12:19.32 --> 00:12:21.32
And just because you say you're under Hickson, it doesn't mean you're legit.

321
00:12:21.32 --> 00:12:24.32
Yeah, you know, so it's like, just we'd have to have some sort of an approval process.

322
00:12:24.32 --> 00:12:25.32
Yeah.

323
00:12:25.32 --> 00:12:27.32
And then at the end of the day, let's say you approve.

324
00:12:27.32 --> 00:12:28.32
I don't know.

325
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:32.32
Could some place and then it then some people see it or, no, no, or people will be like,

326
00:12:32.32 --> 00:12:36.32
Okay, here's the page or the website or whatever they'll be like, okay, this school that I'm like,

327
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:39.32
looking at, I like it, but it's not on this list.

328
00:12:39.32 --> 00:12:40.32
But I don't know.

329
00:12:40.32 --> 00:12:43.32
We didn't get to it kind of thing and then it gets kind of like the day, you know.

330
00:12:43.32 --> 00:12:46.32
It shouldn't be that much of a problem, by the way.

331
00:12:46.32 --> 00:12:48.32
There's not that many fraudulent schools.

332
00:12:48.32 --> 00:12:50.32
We're talking about one right now, possibly, but there's not many out there.

333
00:12:50.32 --> 00:12:52.32
Although they're not so.

334
00:12:52.32 --> 00:12:54.32
Yeah, they're like, they're in strip malls.

335
00:12:54.32 --> 00:12:57.32
You drive by like a strip mall and you see something that says,

336
00:12:57.32 --> 00:13:00.32
Jiu-Jitsu, I mean, no, now there's legit schools in strip malls.

337
00:13:00.32 --> 00:13:02.32
Two of those companies will score.

338
00:13:02.32 --> 00:13:03.32
You're following.

339
00:13:03.32 --> 00:13:05.32
He says legit is he can't legit.

340
00:13:05.32 --> 00:13:06.32
Yeah, legit is legit.

341
00:13:06.32 --> 00:13:07.32
Yeah, it's hard.

342
00:13:07.32 --> 00:13:09.32
You know, I don't know.

343
00:13:09.32 --> 00:13:14.32
But yeah, the, there's actually more strip malls is actually the normal place for

344
00:13:14.32 --> 00:13:16.32
Jiu-Jitsu schools now that I think about it.

345
00:13:16.32 --> 00:13:17.32
Yeah, there's a lot of crazy people.

346
00:13:17.32 --> 00:13:18.32
No one plays, yeah.

347
00:13:18.32 --> 00:13:19.32
Yeah.

348
00:13:19.32 --> 00:13:21.32
The reason one is straight up in the mall.

349
00:13:21.32 --> 00:13:23.32
Oh, and that's not a strip mall, then I'm all.

350
00:13:23.32 --> 00:13:24.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on.

351
00:13:24.32 --> 00:13:26.32
I'm not going to have to go visit Compreeto.

352
00:13:26.32 --> 00:13:27.32
Yeah.

353
00:13:27.32 --> 00:13:30.32
If you watch that video I did with them for a metamorphosis long time ago,

354
00:13:30.32 --> 00:13:32.32
it's like, I forget it feels like I'll fix it now.

355
00:13:32.32 --> 00:13:36.32
But there's this cool, you know, those trains that go around the mall for the kids.

356
00:13:36.32 --> 00:13:40.32
Yeah, it's like, I hate the Chuchu train because it always comes with the by my academy.

357
00:13:40.32 --> 00:13:41.32
Yeah, that's funny.

358
00:13:41.32 --> 00:13:43.32
Especially because the company is such a nice guy.

359
00:13:43.32 --> 00:13:45.32
You figure he like, I love that Chuchu train.

360
00:13:45.32 --> 00:13:47.32
Even, that's exactly how he said it.

361
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:49.32
It's not like he said it, but he says, I hate it.

362
00:13:49.32 --> 00:13:50.32
Meanwhile, he's smiling.

363
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:51.32
Yeah.

364
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:52.32
It's very interesting.

365
00:13:52.32 --> 00:13:53.32
That caught him.

366
00:13:53.32 --> 00:13:54.32
You know it.

367
00:13:54.32 --> 00:13:56.32
Yeah, more information needed on this academy.

368
00:13:56.32 --> 00:13:57.32
Next question.

369
00:13:59.32 --> 00:14:02.32
I am seeing it work as a very assertive and aggressive dude.

370
00:14:02.32 --> 00:14:05.32
And I seem to rub people the wrong way.

371
00:14:05.32 --> 00:14:11.32
When they think I'm upset or frustrated at problems, they present, which is really the case.

372
00:14:11.32 --> 00:14:13.32
I'm just so fired up.

373
00:14:13.32 --> 00:14:17.32
How do I work on my cat while still being assertive with my team?

374
00:14:17.32 --> 00:14:18.32
You know what?

375
00:14:18.32 --> 00:14:20.32
I'm fired up too.

376
00:14:20.32 --> 00:14:21.32
Sure.

377
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:22.32
I like that.

378
00:14:22.32 --> 00:14:28.32
And when I was young, this is, when I was young, sure, I rub some people the wrong way.

379
00:14:28.32 --> 00:14:29.32
I know that.

380
00:14:29.32 --> 00:14:33.32
Even when I was a young kid working on a construction site, guess what I was doing?

381
00:14:33.32 --> 00:14:34.32
Working too hard.

382
00:14:34.32 --> 00:14:36.32
Making people rub people the wrong way.

383
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:41.32
When I got to the team, there was a little crew of us that were too hard to car.

384
00:14:41.32 --> 00:14:43.32
We were too fired up.

385
00:14:43.32 --> 00:14:50.32
We were, I would run the O course with my, with a rock sack with a 40 pound pound sandbag at it.

386
00:14:50.32 --> 00:14:52.32
No one was doing that.

387
00:14:52.32 --> 00:14:56.32
Everyone does it now, but back then there was a small crew of us that were doing it.

388
00:14:56.32 --> 00:14:59.32
Running with jungle boots all the time instead of sneakers.

389
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:03.32
And I literally got pulled aside by some of the old guys.

390
00:15:03.32 --> 00:15:05.32
And by old guys, I don't mean nom.

391
00:15:05.32 --> 00:15:10.32
I mean old guys from wherever, you know, from the, from the 90s.

392
00:15:10.32 --> 00:15:13.32
Or the late 80s.

393
00:15:13.32 --> 00:15:16.32
And you know, I'd get the, they just need to calm down, dude.

394
00:15:16.32 --> 00:15:19.32
You know, you don't need to do that.

395
00:15:19.32 --> 00:15:21.32
And so yeah, maybe I wrote those guys a little bit,

396
00:15:21.32 --> 00:15:23.32
the wrong way, understandable.

397
00:15:23.32 --> 00:15:27.32
But when I got a little older and a little bit more mature,

398
00:15:27.32 --> 00:15:34.32
I got fired up to actually do a good job as a leader to actually build relationships with my

399
00:15:34.32 --> 00:15:44.32
putoon mates. And I got fired up for people to instead of thinking that I was upset or frustrated.

400
00:15:44.32 --> 00:15:49.32
What I was fired up was I wanted people to think that I was calm and cool and collected.

401
00:15:49.32 --> 00:15:51.32
So how's that for totally different?

402
00:15:51.32 --> 00:15:53.32
It's like when we say default aggressive.

403
00:15:53.32 --> 00:15:53.32
Yeah.

404
00:15:53.32 --> 00:15:55.32
And I always say, hey, you're not being aggressive.

405
00:15:55.32 --> 00:15:57.32
And this is being aggressive towards people.

406
00:15:57.32 --> 00:15:58.32
It's not yelling.

407
00:15:58.32 --> 00:15:59.32
It's being aggressive towards your mission.

408
00:15:59.32 --> 00:16:02.32
I was, I'm aggressive towards making people think that I'm not upset.

409
00:16:02.32 --> 00:16:05.32
And that no matter what's going on, the things of man,

410
00:16:05.32 --> 00:16:08.32
chocolates of these not going to lose his temporary super level headed.

411
00:16:08.32 --> 00:16:08.32
Yeah.

412
00:16:08.32 --> 00:16:09.32
Right.

413
00:16:09.32 --> 00:16:11.32
Um, not now.

414
00:16:11.32 --> 00:16:12.32
That being shed.

415
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:15.32
That doesn't mean that I was passive.

416
00:16:15.32 --> 00:16:17.32
That doesn't mean that I wasn't assertive.

417
00:16:17.32 --> 00:16:20.32
It means that I was aggressive and assertive,

418
00:16:20.32 --> 00:16:23.32
but I did it with tact and instead of coming that people straight on,

419
00:16:23.32 --> 00:16:25.32
I flanked them.

420
00:16:25.32 --> 00:16:31.32
I've listened to their little ideas or I made their ideas come from me,

421
00:16:31.32 --> 00:16:32.32
but they didn't know it.

422
00:16:32.32 --> 00:16:33.32
I listened to their solutions.

423
00:16:33.32 --> 00:16:35.32
I helped and supported.

424
00:16:35.32 --> 00:16:40.32
Well, you go so far just by helping people out and helping them with their idea.

425
00:16:40.32 --> 00:16:43.32
Instead of trying to control them and make everything your idea.

426
00:16:43.32 --> 00:16:46.32
So that's my advice here.

427
00:16:46.32 --> 00:16:49.32
Relax calm down.

428
00:16:49.32 --> 00:16:50.32
Focus.

429
00:16:50.32 --> 00:16:51.32
Get fired up.

430
00:16:51.32 --> 00:16:53.32
Get aggressive about being tactful.

431
00:16:53.32 --> 00:16:56.32
Get aggressive about working with people.

432
00:16:56.32 --> 00:17:01.32
Get aggressive about showing your calmness.

433
00:17:01.32 --> 00:17:03.32
That's what you get aggressive about.

434
00:17:03.32 --> 00:17:04.32
Yeah.

435
00:17:04.32 --> 00:17:11.32
Don't get assertive aggressive and create antagonistic relationships across your company.

436
00:17:11.32 --> 00:17:12.32
Yeah.

437
00:17:12.32 --> 00:17:13.32
Check.

438
00:17:13.32 --> 00:17:14.32
Yeah.

439
00:17:14.32 --> 00:17:15.32
Sounds good.

440
00:17:15.32 --> 00:17:22.32
He said he gets or they think he gets upset or frustrated at problems that they present.

441
00:17:22.32 --> 00:17:23.32
Yeah.

442
00:17:23.32 --> 00:17:24.32
Which is rarely the case.

443
00:17:24.32 --> 00:17:25.32
He said I'm just fired up.

444
00:17:25.32 --> 00:17:32.32
So it seems like and I'm no expert, but I'm trying to put myself in this position where

445
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:37.32
I think maybe like it is just a presentation thing.

446
00:17:37.32 --> 00:17:38.32
Yeah.

447
00:17:38.32 --> 00:17:40.32
It definitely is a presentation.

448
00:17:40.32 --> 00:17:41.32
It's aggressive.

449
00:17:41.32 --> 00:17:43.32
Like he's saying he's not even getting frustrated.

450
00:17:43.32 --> 00:17:44.32
No.

451
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:45.32
He's not getting frustrated with him.

452
00:17:45.32 --> 00:17:47.32
For acting just right.

453
00:17:47.32 --> 00:17:48.32
Yeah.

454
00:17:48.32 --> 00:17:49.32
Yeah.

455
00:17:49.32 --> 00:17:50.32
I'm sure mine is.

456
00:17:50.32 --> 00:17:51.32
It's definitely.

457
00:17:51.32 --> 00:17:53.32
It's definitely a presentation thing.

458
00:17:53.32 --> 00:17:54.32
No doubt about it.

459
00:17:54.32 --> 00:17:55.32
Yeah.

460
00:17:55.32 --> 00:17:59.32
But so that means you say, okay, I'm presenting the wrong thing.

461
00:17:59.32 --> 00:18:01.32
I will fix what I'm presenting.

462
00:18:01.32 --> 00:18:02.32
Yeah.

463
00:18:02.32 --> 00:18:04.32
Do you think?

464
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:09.32
Actually, I think you do think this or know this or whatever.

465
00:18:09.32 --> 00:18:13.32
You know how people they'll they'll get nuts or whatever.

466
00:18:13.32 --> 00:18:15.32
They'll they'll be aggressive.

467
00:18:15.32 --> 00:18:16.32
They get fired up.

468
00:18:16.32 --> 00:18:17.32
Right.

469
00:18:17.32 --> 00:18:21.32
And you know, they'll be the loser temper or they're behaving away.

470
00:18:21.32 --> 00:18:25.32
That's that's aggressive towards people.

471
00:18:25.32 --> 00:18:28.32
And their justification is not to say this guy does this.

472
00:18:28.32 --> 00:18:34.32
I don't know, but I'm just saying they're justification is I'm just passionate about it.

473
00:18:34.32 --> 00:18:38.32
I'm just whatever, you know.

474
00:18:38.32 --> 00:18:39.32
Yeah.

475
00:18:39.32 --> 00:18:41.32
Is that that's just the justification right?

476
00:18:41.32 --> 00:18:46.32
It is because yeah, like if at the end of the day it is it's a justification.

477
00:18:46.32 --> 00:18:48.32
It is also a reality.

478
00:18:48.32 --> 00:18:55.32
So think about it from the other perspective, if you're dealing with someone, if you have someone on your team, that gets all that they're passionate about something.

479
00:18:55.32 --> 00:18:58.32
And it can be problematic if they don't learn to control their passions, right?

480
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:07.32
Because they just get, hey, we're going to make this happen and they make bad decisions because they're so passionate about making something happen that they're not doing something logical.

481
00:19:07.32 --> 00:19:09.32
So yes, you could say it's just an excuse.

482
00:19:09.32 --> 00:19:12.32
There's no such thing as a passionate person, but that actually wouldn't be true.

483
00:19:12.32 --> 00:19:14.32
It's not an excuse.

484
00:19:14.32 --> 00:19:15.32
It's a real thing.

485
00:19:15.32 --> 00:19:19.32
Now, if you are aware of that, then why do you keep acting that way?

486
00:19:19.32 --> 00:19:21.32
You've got to put your passions into check.

487
00:19:21.32 --> 00:19:22.32
That's what you've got to do.

488
00:19:22.32 --> 00:19:23.32
100% yeah.

489
00:19:23.32 --> 00:19:28.32
And I meant more like it's an excuse for their behavior.

490
00:19:28.32 --> 00:19:33.32
You know, like to me, I personally, I think that being passionate about something that you're into is good.

491
00:19:33.32 --> 00:19:34.32
Way of beneficial.

492
00:19:34.32 --> 00:19:35.32
Of course.

493
00:19:35.32 --> 00:19:40.32
But again, you know, let's say like, there's a difference between what you feel and how you behave.

494
00:19:40.32 --> 00:19:44.32
You know, so if you're, if you're super passionate about something, it doesn't justify it.

495
00:19:44.32 --> 00:19:50.32
Like all this irrational or emotional or like loss of temper situation behavior.

496
00:19:50.32 --> 00:19:58.32
You seem to say until, you know, yeah, be passionate, but don't behave in some crazy off the handle it.

497
00:19:58.32 --> 00:19:59.32
Agreed.

498
00:19:59.32 --> 00:20:03.32
So I think that they use their passion as an excuse for their behavior.

499
00:20:03.32 --> 00:20:05.32
I just got a quick temper man.

500
00:20:05.32 --> 00:20:06.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
00:20:06.32 --> 00:20:08.32
It doesn't mean that you can act like a woman.

502
00:20:08.32 --> 00:20:09.32
Well, that's worse.

503
00:20:09.32 --> 00:20:10.32
That's, that's the same thing.

504
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:11.32
That's the same thing.

505
00:20:11.32 --> 00:20:12.32
Same thing.

506
00:20:12.32 --> 00:20:13.32
Exactly.

507
00:20:13.32 --> 00:20:15.32
That's just why I'm, I'm unique in that way.

508
00:20:15.32 --> 00:20:17.32
Next question.

509
00:20:17.32 --> 00:20:23.32
My wife told me that she thinks are eleven year old daughters being bullied emotionally by some girls at school.

510
00:20:23.32 --> 00:20:34.32
As I drove into work, I wondered if due to, would give her some tools to help her deal with emotional stress and or bullying that might be taking place.

511
00:20:34.32 --> 00:20:36.32
I think we all know they answer that.

512
00:20:36.32 --> 00:20:53.32
We'll give to this question. Absolutely. Jitu will help eleven years old as a perfect age for getting in there and you will learn to she will learn to defend herself for real and physical confrontations, which will give her confidence, because let's face it.

513
00:20:53.32 --> 00:21:02.32
Emotional and verbal bullying is absolutely backed up by a either.

514
00:21:02.32 --> 00:21:12.32
Clear message of possible violence or a subliminal message of possible violence, right?

515
00:21:12.32 --> 00:21:23.32
I mean, a big girl that's getting picked on the, the underlying messages there, the implied messages there that it could go physical if it had to.

516
00:21:23.32 --> 00:21:31.32
And when that gets removed because the daughter knows how to now fight and defend herself, that starts to impact these emotional bullies as well.

517
00:21:31.32 --> 00:21:34.32
So yes, absolutely.

518
00:21:34.32 --> 00:21:46.32
Get her training. I would throw some boxing in there too, just because that is a pretty empowering thing. You're punching something that feels good and you know what, while we're at it, let's get some working out going on.

519
00:21:46.32 --> 00:21:50.32
Right? Get a pull up bar, get away of the warrior kid, no kidding.

520
00:21:50.32 --> 00:21:51.32
Yeah.

521
00:21:51.32 --> 00:22:04.32
Absolutely get her way of the warrior kid. Don't baby her too much. Yeah. You got to be careful that because she's your daughter and you say, oh, you know, it's so horrible and these girls are picking it. Don't don't do that because guess what?

522
00:22:04.32 --> 00:22:06.32
She's going to be dealing with us her whole life.

523
00:22:06.32 --> 00:22:22.32
You're going to be getting there's always bullies in every environment in the in school environment and the work environment in everywhere there's bullies. Then she's going to have to deal with them. So don't don't baby her where she thinks that you're the one that's going to save her from it.

524
00:22:22.32 --> 00:22:25.32
And I also think she knows that everyone gets bullied.

525
00:22:25.32 --> 00:22:35.32
I got asked that when the warrior kid came out someone said, would you get bullied and they think, of course, I would never get bullied because I'm a big dude. Well, guess what?

526
00:22:35.32 --> 00:22:44.32
When I was nine years old, I was a scrawny little nine year old kid and every buddy that was eleven was bigger than me and stronger than me.

527
00:22:44.32 --> 00:22:59.32
And then when I was eleven, everyone that was thirteen was bigger than me than stronger than me. And when I was fourteen, everyone that was sixteen was bigger than me and stronger than me. So, so you no matter who you are as a kid, there's always somebody that's bigger than you that's going to bully you if they're a jerk.

528
00:22:59.32 --> 00:23:10.32
So, I think she should understand that she's getting bullied right now, but that's that happens to people and people get over it and get through it.

529
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:20.32
And I do think you have to be when you say that you can't leave them, you can't overwhelm her and say everyone gets bullied and you can always get bullied in the office.

530
00:23:20.32 --> 00:23:30.32
You know what I mean? I'm not saying to overwhelm her, I think that's just like, there's a lot, did you ever see the movie the professional?

531
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:30.32
Which one was it? The first guy. Oh yeah, yeah.

532
00:23:30.32 --> 00:23:44.32
And yeah, there's a great scene in that movie where the girl is there's like crazy fight going on between her parents and the apartment, they're yelling each other in the screaming, there's slapping people, the domestic violence is going on and she comes out and she's sitting in the hallway.

533
00:23:44.32 --> 00:23:57.32
And she's crying and the assassin guy kind of walks up the stairs and she looks and he looks at her and she looks at him and she says,

534
00:23:57.32 --> 00:24:06.32
Is life always like this or does it get better when you get older? And he looks at her and says, always like this.

535
00:24:06.32 --> 00:24:20.32
So you gotta be careful that that's not the message that you're sending now there's some reality to that statement like, yeah, guess what life is always going to be hard and you do want to give your kids enough exposure to the hard thing so that they're not weak.

536
00:24:20.32 --> 00:24:36.32
Yeah. And they don't they don't go into panic mode when something tough enters their world. So that's why things like you're just working out or good and exposing them and letting them experience some hard things.

537
00:24:36.32 --> 00:24:44.32
But again, you just don't want to overwhelm her and that's that and by the way, you might as well start training, jiu-jiu-jiu, they're dead.

538
00:24:44.32 --> 00:24:55.32
We get the mom in there too. Yeah, now you gotta excuse to get down in that gym. Yeah, jiu-jitsu want. And I know you don't train jiu-jitsu because if you did, you wouldn't be asking this question, you being getting her training.

539
00:24:55.32 --> 00:25:01.32
Yeah. You make it out of happiness. So you emotionally bullied.

540
00:25:01.32 --> 00:25:03.32
So this is interesting.

541
00:25:03.32 --> 00:25:14.32
In the new warrior kid book, the bully. There's a bully in there, but he's not a bully like Kenny Williams. Who's a big strong bully. He's a bully that's an emotional bully kind of is deep.

542
00:25:14.32 --> 00:25:19.32
And every time there seems like there's going to be a confrontation he finds a way to weasel out of it. Yeah.

543
00:25:19.32 --> 00:25:25.32
You know, so he'll harass people, but then he'll get harassed people. He knows perfectly how to push the buttons. That's what Mark's are dealing with.

544
00:25:25.32 --> 00:25:34.32
It's a kid named Nathan James. Nathan James causes problems. Yeah, there's some layers in that name for sure.

545
00:25:34.32 --> 00:25:39.32
That I saw this, this makes a lot of sense to me because I have a daughter.

546
00:25:39.32 --> 00:25:43.32
Four and a half by the way, it goes to pre-K.

547
00:25:43.32 --> 00:25:47.32
It's like pre-school. Pre-K, is that the jiu-jiu school she goes, no.

548
00:25:47.32 --> 00:25:51.32
No, bra. Anyway, she's a instructor.

549
00:25:51.32 --> 00:26:01.32
She told me one day. She said that her friends, I'm not going to say their name doesn't matter.

550
00:26:01.32 --> 00:26:10.32
She said, this friend told me that she's not my friend. She's only this other girls friend.

551
00:26:10.32 --> 00:26:13.32
That's emotional. That's emotional bullying.

552
00:26:13.32 --> 00:26:22.32
Right. Right. For the four and a half year old version of the way. So it gets way worse at 11, by the way. And then probably way worse at 15, 16.

553
00:26:22.32 --> 00:26:29.32
It's just my assumption. So what I told her, not to say this is the right answer, but maybe it's something to think about.

554
00:26:29.32 --> 00:26:39.32
So my daughter does jiu-jiu has done jiu-jitsu. Double leg choke. Well, like it. Well, that's what you want to say.

555
00:26:39.32 --> 00:26:45.32
It's smashed it and she's bigger than everyone. No. No. No.

556
00:26:45.32 --> 00:26:50.32
So what would you tell her? My daughter's trained to be a nice bro. I always have this underlying thing.

557
00:26:50.32 --> 00:26:54.32
No matter if someone beats me into you, that doesn't mean you be mean to them. That makes you mean person.

558
00:26:54.32 --> 00:27:00.32
I said, mean people will be mean to other people. Nice people tend to not be mean to other people.

559
00:27:00.32 --> 00:27:02.32
That's really real basic stuff.

560
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:05.32
Fundamental. I like it. Yeah. But she's for her.

561
00:27:05.32 --> 00:27:13.32
So you just keep reminding her. So I told her, hey, look, if she doesn't want to be your friend, then she's not your friend.

562
00:27:13.32 --> 00:27:16.32
And that's okay. Does that mean you be mean to her? No.

563
00:27:16.32 --> 00:27:23.32
But at the end of the day, she and I said, are you stronger than her? She said, yeah.

564
00:27:23.32 --> 00:27:28.32
Is it? Are you smarter than her? She said, yeah. I don't know. She is a reason. Here's the thing.

565
00:27:28.32 --> 00:27:33.32
It's a self-empowering thing, just like how you said, where she knows you jiu-jitsu. She smarter.

566
00:27:33.32 --> 00:27:36.32
She's stronger. She can do more pull-ups. She can do more burpees and stuff like that.

567
00:27:36.32 --> 00:27:39.32
All this stuff. It starts to form in her head. Hopefully.

568
00:27:39.32 --> 00:27:44.32
Oh, the go. Yeah. Hopefully little form in her head that if they don't want to be my friend.

569
00:27:44.32 --> 00:27:50.32
That's okay. That's no loss to me. Maybe if someone who's strong like me, smart like me.

570
00:27:50.32 --> 00:27:55.32
And whatever like me didn't want to be, well, maybe that's something, but this isn't the case.

571
00:27:55.32 --> 00:28:00.32
It's kind of that idea. I think that's going to be the advice. I think the thing of just saying, oh, yeah.

572
00:28:00.32 --> 00:28:02.32
That's okay. Not everyone's going to want to be your friend. That's okay.

573
00:28:02.32 --> 00:28:05.32
Yeah. And some people are going to like you and some people aren't going to like you. That's okay.

574
00:28:05.32 --> 00:28:07.32
You just be nice to everyone. That's fine. Yeah.

575
00:28:07.32 --> 00:28:16.32
I got to ask that question when we did the one warrior kid podcast a bunch of people asked, oh, my, I feel like people don't want to hang around with me.

576
00:28:16.32 --> 00:28:21.32
And I was like, yeah, that's okay. That's okay. You don't need to hang around with people all the time.

577
00:28:21.32 --> 00:28:25.32
I don't, I don't like even like hanging around with people. I didn't say that because I don't want to turn around with you.

578
00:28:25.32 --> 00:28:27.32
I saw social person like me, but.

579
00:28:27.32 --> 00:28:41.32
Yeah, that makes it in that thing or I think you just said, where my daughter always asks, you know, did people not want to be your friend or what she'd like bumper head real hard.

580
00:28:41.32 --> 00:28:47.32
She like, did you use the bump your head when you were little, you know, she always wants to know like am I alone in this whole, whole deal.

581
00:28:47.32 --> 00:28:56.32
And man, it seems like it really helps what I say. No, I used to all the time. I show her like my scars and stuff like that and she'll be like, oh, and you can tell she feels better.

582
00:28:56.32 --> 00:29:00.32
Yeah, that's pretty cool. It's weird. I think that would help with a bullying thing.

583
00:29:00.32 --> 00:29:14.32
And it's good. Your daughter's smart. And so she has the capability of formulating that question. I bet a lot of kids might not be able to even say, hey, did you bump your head to where as a parent, if you just recognize that they probably feel alone.

584
00:29:14.32 --> 00:29:25.32
And so if you say, oh, I know you bump your head. I used to bump my head to one time. Look, I got to scorn my head at half of me too. So they don't make your kids beg for a partner in the world. Give it to them.

585
00:29:25.32 --> 00:29:34.32
Follow the aquatrols model of parenting. And that makes sense to another. I'm thinking of it because it's like, even as an adult. Okay. So you got to kid and they're like, hey, did you, I don't know.

586
00:29:34.32 --> 00:29:46.32
Did you bump your head like this and get blood on your head, whatever when you're little and you're like, yeah. And if you add this and this is how I dealt with it, right? Because a lot of times like you give them a little path.

587
00:29:46.32 --> 00:29:58.32
Yes, exactly right. So you got this poor little kid, the bump their head and it's like, dang. I don't even, I've never felt this before. There's a lot of pain. There's blood. Hope that's scary. I don't know really how to deal with it. Right.

588
00:29:58.32 --> 00:30:12.32
So of course you go to your dad and then you dad's like, hey, yeah, I've done it. This is how I did it. This is how I dealt with it. And she's like, okay, maybe I can do with it. And even adult because adults, we do that too. You know, like, dang, I'm getting, I don't know, audit it.

589
00:30:12.32 --> 00:30:19.32
I'm getting audited through first time, whatever, juggle, hey, you know, or, you know, you're trying to whatever is like, hey, I got audited and this way you can.

590
00:30:19.32 --> 00:30:31.32
Back, this is like how you deal with it and all this, boom, you feel better about it. And D and more empowered. And that's on top of the jujitsu. If I got audited out of way or I don't know, jujitsu, then not by the way.

591
00:30:31.32 --> 00:30:32.32
Yeah, yeah.

592
00:30:32.32 --> 00:30:35.32
Check. Next question.

593
00:30:35.32 --> 00:30:42.16
I've got a leadership situation I need help with. I was promoted to a troop commander position over a fellow team leader who now

594
00:30:42.16 --> 00:30:58.16
reports to me. He has many years of experience and a lot of knowledge. He's very, he's very bitter and not getting the promotion, not getting the promotion. And it's letting me know when I include him in decision making for the troop or try to tap into his knowledge and experience.

595
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:08.16
He shuts down refuses to give input and says that I should already have the answers since I'm the troop commander.

596
00:31:08.16 --> 00:31:15.16
I know the troop would benefit from his input and team dynamics would be much improved if it wasn't so negative.

597
00:31:15.16 --> 00:31:27.16
I've tried to let him know that I value his experience. I feel that his input would be beneficial and that his negative attitude and bearing are not acceptable.

598
00:31:27.16 --> 00:31:37.16
It is making him very ineffective team leader. I'm failing at getting through to him and I don't want, I don't want to fire him for his position.

599
00:31:37.16 --> 00:31:42.16
How can I get him to value his own position in the troop and become effective again?

600
00:31:42.16 --> 00:31:50.16
I actually think you're doing the right thing and you've opened the door for him. I think that's a good first initial approach.

601
00:31:50.16 --> 00:31:58.16
But obviously doesn't seem to be working. Now a couple different courses of actions you could take. One of the things you could do is actually give him some higher responsibility.

602
00:31:58.16 --> 00:32:07.16
I've put his team in charge, put him in charge, the whole team sometimes. Maybe he will step up and start to lead and see that he's now able to prove that you have a lot of trust in him and all that stuff.

603
00:32:07.16 --> 00:32:14.16
There's also a chance. Think about this. There's also a chance that you might be coming off as come to sending to him.

604
00:32:14.16 --> 00:32:18.16
So imagine this. Hey, I go, I value your experience.

605
00:32:18.16 --> 00:32:20.16
Oh, no, right?

606
00:32:20.16 --> 00:32:30.16
You know, the troop would really benefit from your input. It's like you're treating him like it's easy to get and he's getting that those can come off as congeny. So we have to put those a little bit in check as well.

607
00:32:30.16 --> 00:32:36.16
And I think those are a little bit, you know, you put the put the person in charge. You try that.

608
00:32:36.16 --> 00:32:45.16
You've opened up to try and get their input and get them involved. But it's it might be coming in my becoming across as congeny sending even if it's even if you're doing it.

609
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:54.16
Even if you're just saying, hey man, could really use your input on this thing. It'd be great. Even if you're doing it in like a cool way in your mind, you might be hearing, oh, I could really use your hand.

610
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:59.16
So even if you're saying it in a perfect way, it still might be hitting his ears in a different way.

611
00:32:59.16 --> 00:33:01.16
So I don't know.

612
00:33:01.16 --> 00:33:04.16
At this point, I think what I would do is I would maybe just back off.

613
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:12.16
I would just go forward, treating him like one of the leaders and expect him to perform as you expect your leaders to perform.

614
00:33:12.16 --> 00:33:17.16
I think you've made the effort. It didn't really work. And now you have a job of doing. You got to get on with it.

615
00:33:17.16 --> 00:33:26.16
There's also, you know, the world doesn't revolve around his pouting and his being negative.

616
00:33:26.16 --> 00:33:35.16
And you can't let that happen. Now on top of that, this guy's a powder and he's a negative guy. That's probably the reason he didn't get selected to be promoted.

617
00:33:35.16 --> 00:33:42.16
What we talked about earlier, the boss saw that. He saw something along the way where things didn't go his way and he, and he pouted into his negative.

618
00:33:42.16 --> 00:33:46.16
And that's why he didn't get promoted. Meanwhile, the guy that did get promoted when things didn't go his way, he's like, okay, cool.

619
00:33:46.16 --> 00:33:50.16
We'll drive on with with the new plan. And that's why you got promoted.

620
00:33:50.16 --> 00:33:54.16
So I would say move on.

621
00:33:54.16 --> 00:34:01.16
Do your job. Treat him like you would treat one of your leaders. I'd be very careful that you don't overcorrect.

622
00:34:01.16 --> 00:34:06.16
Because you hear me say, like, okay, I'm going to treat him normal. Now all of a sudden, you're treating him like crap.

623
00:34:06.16 --> 00:34:14.16
Don't do that. But treat him as firmly and as fairly as you would, anyone of your subordinate leaders.

624
00:34:14.16 --> 00:34:21.16
And we have to see what it goes from there. He may end up just not being able to deal with this fact.

625
00:34:21.16 --> 00:34:25.16
I mean, there's a reason why some people get promoted and some people don't.

626
00:34:25.16 --> 00:34:28.16
And maybe he's one of these people that can't humble himself,

627
00:34:28.16 --> 00:34:33.16
which is one of our biggest fears in somebody that's trying to be a leader is that they can't humble themselves.

628
00:34:33.16 --> 00:34:36.16
And if that's what's going on, he's going to have a long, hard road.

629
00:34:36.16 --> 00:34:41.16
And you know, who's fault that's going to be? Never his. Never going to be his fault.

630
00:34:41.16 --> 00:34:45.16
Everyone else is fault. And that'll be problematic.

631
00:34:45.16 --> 00:34:47.16
Yeah.

632
00:34:47.16 --> 00:34:50.16
Yeah. That's a tough one right there.

633
00:34:50.16 --> 00:34:54.16
Yeah. Cause in his mind straight up, that like,

634
00:34:54.16 --> 00:34:58.16
you're condescending you don't deserve it. I deserve it.

635
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:00.16
You know, and now you're kind of early in the day.

636
00:35:00.16 --> 00:35:02.16
Yeah. He's already lacking humility.

637
00:35:02.16 --> 00:35:09.16
What's this? One time in football in it was junior varsity football.

638
00:35:09.16 --> 00:35:12.16
And we're, we're suiting up to play game.

639
00:35:12.16 --> 00:35:16.16
Right. And my bro, Jade, he was, he's really good.

640
00:35:16.16 --> 00:35:19.16
So he, you know, you know how you have that one guy's version,

641
00:35:19.16 --> 00:35:22.16
junior varsity, you have the one guy who makes the majority of the touchdowns.

642
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:27.16
You know, that's what Jade was at guy. So we're suiting up.

643
00:35:27.16 --> 00:35:32.16
And one of our team guys on the team, he was, he was that guy right there.

644
00:35:32.16 --> 00:35:35.16
He was, he was, he wasn't the thing is, but he wasn't very valid.

645
00:35:35.16 --> 00:35:40.16
He wasn't very athletic, you know, and they kind of played the same position.

646
00:35:40.16 --> 00:35:43.16
Jade was running back. He was running back to, I think this guy was a full back.

647
00:35:43.16 --> 00:35:46.16
I don't know if I forget. Anyway, so he goes to, he goes to Jade.

648
00:35:46.16 --> 00:35:48.16
Oh, time to show off again.

649
00:35:48.16 --> 00:35:49.16
Yeah.

650
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:52.16
Holy cow. So you imagine the mindset, it's the same.

651
00:35:52.16 --> 00:35:55.16
That guy probably has the same kind of mindset.

652
00:35:55.16 --> 00:35:56.16
Absolutely.

653
00:35:56.16 --> 00:35:59.16
So it's like, man, it's like, you can't even if you are doing the right things.

654
00:35:59.16 --> 00:36:02.16
How you said, like, saying everything all cool in his ears.

655
00:36:02.16 --> 00:36:03.16
It sounds different.

656
00:36:03.16 --> 00:36:04.16
And his ears, it sounds different.

657
00:36:04.16 --> 00:36:05.16
Just showing off again.

658
00:36:05.16 --> 00:36:06.16
Yep.

659
00:36:06.16 --> 00:36:10.16
So sometimes when someone isn't going to hear your words correctly,

660
00:36:10.16 --> 00:36:12.16
sometimes it's best not to say it.

661
00:36:12.16 --> 00:36:13.16
Oh, yeah.

662
00:36:13.16 --> 00:36:15.16
Sometimes just keep the mouth shut.

663
00:36:15.16 --> 00:36:17.16
And you haven't been in an argument with someone,

664
00:36:17.16 --> 00:36:20.16
but you're completely trying to de-escalate it.

665
00:36:20.16 --> 00:36:23.16
And every single thing you said is getting taken the wrong way.

666
00:36:23.16 --> 00:36:25.16
Be quiet, listen, nod your head.

667
00:36:25.16 --> 00:36:28.16
Anyway, you're not going to convince someone.

668
00:36:28.16 --> 00:36:30.16
You're not going to get through them.

669
00:36:30.16 --> 00:36:31.16
They're too emotional.

670
00:36:31.16 --> 00:36:32.16
This guy's too negative.

671
00:36:32.16 --> 00:36:33.16
Yeah.

672
00:36:33.16 --> 00:36:36.16
And everything you say is going to be heard differently.

673
00:36:36.16 --> 00:36:38.16
And not in a positive way.

674
00:36:38.16 --> 00:36:39.16
Yeah. Yeah.

675
00:36:39.16 --> 00:36:41.16
I don't really cut opportunity cost of addressing it.

676
00:36:41.16 --> 00:36:42.16
It is just.

677
00:36:42.16 --> 00:36:43.16
Yeah.

678
00:36:43.16 --> 00:36:44.16
To my ear.

679
00:36:44.16 --> 00:36:45.16
Next question.

680
00:36:45.16 --> 00:36:48.16
I'm often given tasks on the fly,

681
00:36:48.16 --> 00:36:51.16
whereas many of my tasks are given as a result of meetings.

682
00:36:51.16 --> 00:36:55.16
These days, and increasing number are coming from emails,

683
00:36:55.16 --> 00:36:58.16
or my manager or client ask me to do something.

684
00:36:58.16 --> 00:37:02.16
I find myself quite disorganized when dealing with this.

685
00:37:02.16 --> 00:37:04.16
I'm writing things down when I'm told,

686
00:37:04.16 --> 00:37:06.16
but it's all over the place.

687
00:37:06.16 --> 00:37:08.16
Post it, note book, phone, etc.

688
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:11.16
I don't have a solid method of keeping track of these things.

689
00:37:11.16 --> 00:37:14.16
I'm guessing that a possible solution is to write all these things.

690
00:37:14.16 --> 00:37:17.16
Down in the same place, but I've also tried that,

691
00:37:17.16 --> 00:37:19.16
and didn't really make a difference.

692
00:37:19.16 --> 00:37:21.16
I'd appreciate any input or advice.

693
00:37:21.16 --> 00:37:26.16
You have on how to record and track objectives in a functional and reliable manner.

694
00:37:26.16 --> 00:37:31.16
As I'm subjected to a lot of information each day, week month,

695
00:37:31.16 --> 00:37:34.16
I'm definitely overloaded to remember it myself.

696
00:37:34.16 --> 00:37:36.16
Discipline equals freedom.

697
00:37:36.16 --> 00:37:37.16
So yeah.

698
00:37:37.16 --> 00:37:38.16
The few things first of all,

699
00:37:38.16 --> 00:37:41.16
definitely write the things down in one place.

700
00:37:41.16 --> 00:37:44.16
And it sounds like, since you're moving all the time

701
00:37:44.16 --> 00:37:45.16
or you're going to meetings,

702
00:37:45.16 --> 00:37:49.16
just a nice little notebook with you and write the things down

703
00:37:49.16 --> 00:37:51.16
as you get tasked with them.

704
00:37:51.16 --> 00:37:55.16
Then on top of that, you have to have a master list of some kind.

705
00:37:55.16 --> 00:37:58.16
Either paper or digital,

706
00:37:58.16 --> 00:38:00.16
I'm going to probably recommend digital

707
00:38:00.16 --> 00:38:04.16
to track things overall in a prioritized method.

708
00:38:04.16 --> 00:38:06.16
So if you get tasked with something in a meeting

709
00:38:06.16 --> 00:38:07.16
and your little notebook, you come back,

710
00:38:07.16 --> 00:38:10.16
you put it in the right place in the master task list.

711
00:38:10.16 --> 00:38:13.16
And then twice a day,

712
00:38:13.16 --> 00:38:17.16
consolidate the information that's in the little notebook you have

713
00:38:17.16 --> 00:38:19.16
into the big master list.

714
00:38:19.16 --> 00:38:22.16
And then before you go to bed at night,

715
00:38:22.16 --> 00:38:26.16
you organize those things by priority on the master list.

716
00:38:26.16 --> 00:38:28.16
You put the most important thing at the top,

717
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:31.16
and that's what you're going to attack the next day.

718
00:38:31.16 --> 00:38:33.16
That's part one.

719
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:34.16
And how you get these things organized.

720
00:38:34.16 --> 00:38:37.16
Now the part two is you've got a schedule that's going to be

721
00:38:37.16 --> 00:38:40.16
done. And how you get these things organized. Now the part two is you've got a schedule this stuff.

722
00:38:40.16 --> 00:38:44.16
And actually, I always say this when people have trouble with tasks,

723
00:38:44.16 --> 00:38:46.16
put them on the calendar.

724
00:38:46.16 --> 00:38:48.16
You know, actually Jamie does that for me.

725
00:38:48.16 --> 00:38:50.16
When Jamie's got something for me to do,

726
00:38:50.16 --> 00:38:52.16
she just doesn't email me and say,

727
00:38:52.16 --> 00:38:54.16
hey, you need to do this. She puts it on the calendar.

728
00:38:54.16 --> 00:38:56.16
So I look at my calendar bone there as I got to go do this,

729
00:38:56.16 --> 00:38:59.16
whatever this task is done.

730
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:02.16
So put these things on your calendar and that includes

731
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:06.16
scheduling time on your calendar so that you can have time

732
00:39:06.16 --> 00:39:10.16
to consolidate your list and do a review of your lists.

733
00:39:10.16 --> 00:39:14.16
You know, whether that takes that probably take 15 minutes to do.

734
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:18.16
And I guess there's a bunch of apps you can use.

735
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:20.16
And I'm sure people will make recommendation,

736
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:23.16
but there's a ton of to do list apps,

737
00:39:23.16 --> 00:39:25.16
including there's one,

738
00:39:25.16 --> 00:39:27.16
there's native ones on all the different phones.

739
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:29.16
So you could look at that as a possible.

740
00:39:29.16 --> 00:39:30.16
A voice recorder.

741
00:39:30.16 --> 00:39:33.16
You can either use the voice recorder app you have

742
00:39:33.16 --> 00:39:36.16
or you can carry around a little mini voice recorder

743
00:39:36.16 --> 00:39:38.16
then you can just take notes with that

744
00:39:38.16 --> 00:39:41.16
and then you consolidate those notes from your

745
00:39:41.16 --> 00:39:46.16
voice recorder into your master task list every day.

746
00:39:46.16 --> 00:39:49.16
And then you just got to prioritize next cue.

747
00:39:49.16 --> 00:39:54.16
It's pretty straight forward.

748
00:39:54.16 --> 00:39:55.16
Right.

749
00:39:55.16 --> 00:39:56.16
Stuff down.

750
00:39:56.16 --> 00:39:59.16
I always put little boxes in front of everything.

751
00:39:59.16 --> 00:40:01.16
Do you understand like when I have a task,

752
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:03.16
I put little box in front of it.

753
00:40:03.16 --> 00:40:04.16
So I can check it.

754
00:40:04.16 --> 00:40:05.16
Yeah, it makes,

755
00:40:05.16 --> 00:40:07.16
bro, you're obviously,

756
00:40:07.16 --> 00:40:09.16
come here to do me a master.

757
00:40:09.16 --> 00:40:11.16
Like all that is like dang.

758
00:40:11.16 --> 00:40:14.16
Bro, I'm on the fly just like this guy.

759
00:40:14.16 --> 00:40:17.16
This person straight up like on the fly.

760
00:40:17.16 --> 00:40:18.16
New stuff comes up.

761
00:40:18.16 --> 00:40:19.16
You'd be surprised.

762
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:22.16
You'd be surprised at how much more you could get done.

763
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:24.16
If you actually made a list of things you're supposed to do.

764
00:40:24.16 --> 00:40:25.16
How's this?

765
00:40:25.16 --> 00:40:26.16
How's this?

766
00:40:26.16 --> 00:40:30.16
I make a list and I still try to try to nail it down.

767
00:40:30.16 --> 00:40:32.16
I'll make a list.

768
00:40:32.16 --> 00:40:36.16
I even, okay, so I have a book that Jamie gave me by the way.

769
00:40:36.16 --> 00:40:40.16
A book, a to-do list book.

770
00:40:40.16 --> 00:40:46.16
And then I have my phone.

771
00:40:46.16 --> 00:40:48.16
And then I have this,

772
00:40:48.16 --> 00:40:50.16
oh, and then I have just a regular thing on the paper.

773
00:40:50.16 --> 00:40:55.16
And then I do this thing where I'll open word and have it on my side screen.

774
00:40:55.16 --> 00:40:57.16
And I'll put the list there for the day.

775
00:40:57.16 --> 00:40:58.16
It'll just be up.

776
00:40:58.16 --> 00:41:00.16
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

777
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:03.16
Strangely, that has proven to be the best one.

778
00:41:03.16 --> 00:41:07.16
Because I'm, and here I see my mistake right now that I'm telling you this.

779
00:41:07.16 --> 00:41:10.16
I put it on the book that Jamie gave me, right?

780
00:41:10.16 --> 00:41:11.16
I might to do this.

781
00:41:11.16 --> 00:41:12.16
I put it there.

782
00:41:12.16 --> 00:41:14.16
And then I'll tell you this.

783
00:41:14.16 --> 00:41:15.16
It's on that book.

784
00:41:15.16 --> 00:41:18.16
There's one on the on the phone, which is different now by the way.

785
00:41:18.16 --> 00:41:19.16
The master list.

786
00:41:19.16 --> 00:41:20.16
Yeah.

787
00:41:20.16 --> 00:41:21.16
There's some apps that make.

788
00:41:21.16 --> 00:41:23.16
So it doesn't matter if you put it in your phone.

789
00:41:23.16 --> 00:41:25.16
If you put it in your computer, I mean, you can obviously,

790
00:41:25.16 --> 00:41:29.16
if it's on paper, you need to transpose it into digital format.

791
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:32.16
But there's, there's things that you, yeah, you need to consolidate the list.

792
00:41:32.16 --> 00:41:34.16
You have a master list of things that you're trying to do.

793
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:39.16
And then I need to attach myself as far as the routine goes to look at that list.

794
00:41:39.16 --> 00:41:44.16
You know, like, that's why you schedule it, which is what I just said.

795
00:41:44.16 --> 00:41:45.16
That's why you put it on your schedule.

796
00:41:45.16 --> 00:41:49.16
Hey, every day when I sit down for lunch, I'm going to do a five minute review of my

797
00:41:49.16 --> 00:41:53.16
list and make sure one track that gives you the afternoon to catch up on anything you

798
00:41:53.16 --> 00:41:58.16
might have missed and just get rid of my other list because half of it is me trying different

799
00:41:58.16 --> 00:41:59.16
methods out.

800
00:41:59.16 --> 00:42:02.16
Right in the middle of carrying out one other method.

801
00:42:02.16 --> 00:42:07.16
You know, so there's a bad thing about trying different trying to combine a bunch of different

802
00:42:07.16 --> 00:42:08.16
methods.

803
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:11.16
What you're doing when you do that is you're looking for the easiest way.

804
00:42:11.16 --> 00:42:17.16
And I'll tell you the funniest clearest example of that when Dean first started fighting

805
00:42:17.16 --> 00:42:21.16
and he was going through his various stages of trying to figure out how to cut weight.

806
00:42:21.16 --> 00:42:24.16
And he already cut weight and high school is a wrestler.

807
00:42:24.16 --> 00:42:25.16
He knew how to cut weight.

808
00:42:25.16 --> 00:42:29.16
But what happened is people would come along and say, hey, there's this trick.

809
00:42:29.16 --> 00:42:30.16
Yeah.

810
00:42:30.16 --> 00:42:31.16
There's that trick and there's that trick.

811
00:42:31.16 --> 00:42:34.16
And he would try these all these little tricks out.

812
00:42:34.16 --> 00:42:38.16
And you would try them at the same time.

813
00:42:38.16 --> 00:42:39.16
Yeah.

814
00:42:39.16 --> 00:42:40.16
Yeah.

815
00:42:40.16 --> 00:42:42.16
And that's exactly what you guess what.

816
00:42:42.16 --> 00:42:45.16
You don't when you trial these different because what you're really doing

817
00:42:45.16 --> 00:42:47.16
you're looking for something that sounds easy.

818
00:42:47.16 --> 00:42:52.16
Yeah.

819
00:42:52.16 --> 00:42:55.16
I'll do that.

820
00:42:55.16 --> 00:42:56.16
It was the, you know, for Dean, it was like, oh, I'll go in the episode,

821
00:42:56.16 --> 00:42:59.16
salt bath in the hot tub and then it was, oh, you know, and I'll drink just to still water

822
00:42:59.16 --> 00:43:03.16
for the ex amount of days and it's all these, which all these things are viable, right?

823
00:43:03.16 --> 00:43:10.16
We know that they're viable options, but there's you have to use them in conjunks.

824
00:43:10.16 --> 00:43:14.16
They have to, you have to, you can't just like pull the pull whatever little piece you want

825
00:43:14.16 --> 00:43:19.16
and think you're going to be good to go. No, you've got to do, you've got to follow the system.

826
00:43:19.16 --> 00:43:19.16
Yeah.

827
00:43:19.16 --> 00:43:21.16
Take one and go with it kind of.

828
00:43:21.16 --> 00:43:22.16
Yeah.

829
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:25.16
And what you're trying to do is you're looking for things that sound the easiest.

830
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:27.16
And that's what you're trying to do.

831
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:28.16
Yeah.

832
00:43:28.16 --> 00:43:29.16
That's what we're going to do.

833
00:43:29.16 --> 00:43:30.16
Easy path.

834
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:31.16
We don't like easy path over here.

835
00:43:31.16 --> 00:43:34.16
But meanwhile, like, you got three different paths, all effective.

836
00:43:34.16 --> 00:43:37.16
Meanwhile, you're jumping from one path to the other and you're not even getting

837
00:43:37.16 --> 00:43:38.16
nice.

838
00:43:38.16 --> 00:43:40.16
That's exactly what I'm doing with my to-do list.

839
00:43:40.16 --> 00:43:42.16
I've like four to do list.

840
00:43:42.16 --> 00:43:43.16
Okay.

841
00:43:43.16 --> 00:43:46.16
Being needed to do list that says consolidate all the way up to do list.

842
00:43:46.16 --> 00:43:47.16
That's step number one.

843
00:43:47.16 --> 00:43:50.16
Then I got to remember that that's the list that I'm checking.

844
00:43:50.16 --> 00:43:55.16
Then I got to remember to check it because you know how you up because you always have that to do this in your brain.

845
00:43:55.16 --> 00:43:56.16
You always do.

846
00:43:56.16 --> 00:43:57.16
You know, you like, oh, I got that thing.

847
00:43:57.16 --> 00:43:58.16
By the way, my mind.

848
00:43:58.16 --> 00:44:00.16
You wanted my brain is real solid.

849
00:44:00.16 --> 00:44:01.16
What?

850
00:44:01.16 --> 00:44:05.16
Like the, just the two to do list in my brain is really, really solid.

851
00:44:05.16 --> 00:44:06.16
Yeah.

852
00:44:06.16 --> 00:44:07.16
Like I know what I have to do.

853
00:44:07.16 --> 00:44:08.16
Yeah.

854
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:11.16
The only, the things I have to write down are things that outside this outside this.

855
00:44:11.16 --> 00:44:19.16
The, the, the, the parameters of daily situations like let's say there's some admin thing that only comes up.

856
00:44:19.16 --> 00:44:22.16
Well, if it comes out super rarely, I'll remember it.

857
00:44:22.16 --> 00:44:25.16
But if it's an admin thing that comes up once every quarter.

858
00:44:25.16 --> 00:44:26.16
Yeah.

859
00:44:26.16 --> 00:44:26.16
Yeah.

860
00:44:26.16 --> 00:44:27.16
I don't, I probably won't remember that.

861
00:44:27.16 --> 00:44:30.16
It's not, it's not so far outside that I remember and it's not in the routine.

862
00:44:30.16 --> 00:44:31.16
So I don't remember.

863
00:44:31.16 --> 00:44:32.16
So I got to write that thing down.

864
00:44:32.16 --> 00:44:33.16
That's what's on my list.

865
00:44:33.16 --> 00:44:38.16
So do you write down the list that's in your head on the on the on the written list?

866
00:44:38.16 --> 00:44:48.16
I'll write down the things that I know are are subject to being forgotten because the other things I don't forget them.

867
00:44:48.16 --> 00:44:52.16
Yeah. So you're just, I don't forget the hard, like, company and I can.

868
00:44:52.16 --> 00:44:57.16
If I have a, let's say I'm going on a trip of a kind, like if I'm going on a regular trip,

869
00:44:57.16 --> 00:45:03.16
if I'm going to go to company that I work with and there in Atlanta and I'm going to fly out there for three days,

870
00:45:03.16 --> 00:45:05.16
I don't even, I don't even have to think about that.

871
00:45:05.16 --> 00:45:12.16
Everything that I do is, is the work I'm doing, the prep I'm doing, everything I do is just standard it's a standard operating,

872
00:45:12.16 --> 00:45:15.16
even the, even the things I'm going to bring with me.

873
00:45:15.16 --> 00:45:16.16
It's the same.

874
00:45:16.16 --> 00:45:19.16
I went on a one day trip to Vegas the other day like in and out.

875
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:24.16
I didn't even stay the night and I had the same suitcase that I take when I go on a five day trip.

876
00:45:24.16 --> 00:45:25.16
Like it doesn't matter.

877
00:45:25.16 --> 00:45:27.16
I'm not changing any standard operating procedures.

878
00:45:27.16 --> 00:45:27.16
Yeah.

879
00:45:27.16 --> 00:45:29.16
I got there and they said, aren't you leaving today?

880
00:45:29.16 --> 00:45:30.16
I said, yeah.

881
00:45:30.16 --> 00:45:31.16
Why do you bring a suitcase?

882
00:45:31.16 --> 00:45:32.16
This is how I, this is how I travel.

883
00:45:32.16 --> 00:45:34.16
This is the standard operating procedure for me.

884
00:45:34.16 --> 00:45:35.16
I'm not deviating from it.

885
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:41.16
Whether I'm going for one day, like a nine hour trip to Vegas or a five day trip to Atlanta,

886
00:45:41.16 --> 00:45:42.16
guess what?

887
00:45:42.16 --> 00:45:43.16
It doesn't matter.

888
00:45:43.16 --> 00:45:45.16
I'm carrying the same thing because that's what I do.

889
00:45:45.16 --> 00:45:49.16
So if it's something like that, I don't need to, don't even need things.

890
00:45:49.16 --> 00:45:53.16
Some things don't make my list because they're already my, my list of my head is solid.

891
00:45:53.16 --> 00:45:54.16
Yeah.

892
00:45:54.16 --> 00:45:58.16
It's things that are outside the bounds of the standard operating procedures, those are things that

893
00:45:58.16 --> 00:45:59.16
don't make the list.

894
00:45:59.16 --> 00:46:00.16
Yeah.

895
00:46:00.16 --> 00:46:01.16
And then makes sense for this question.

896
00:46:01.16 --> 00:46:02.16
It's kind of this question because he's getting stuff on the fly.

897
00:46:02.16 --> 00:46:04.16
He's getting stuff on the fly.

898
00:46:04.16 --> 00:46:06.16
He's got to be, he's got to be like this stuff down.

899
00:46:06.16 --> 00:46:07.16
Yeah.

900
00:46:07.16 --> 00:46:12.16
I think we're all kind of the same way in that way where you're going to have one, two, maybe

901
00:46:12.16 --> 00:46:16.16
three things on your mind that no way I'm going to forget this, you know, kind of thing.

902
00:46:16.16 --> 00:46:22.16
But man, those lists, though, you got to, you really got to choose one path and stick with it.

903
00:46:22.16 --> 00:46:24.16
And then remember, that's the thing.

904
00:46:24.16 --> 00:46:26.16
I think that's my problem.

905
00:46:26.16 --> 00:46:28.16
I know that.

906
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:30.16
Next question.

907
00:46:30.16 --> 00:46:35.16
How did you deal with losses in jiu-jitsu?

908
00:46:35.16 --> 00:46:37.16
Jiu-jitsu day today.

909
00:46:37.16 --> 00:46:38.16
MMM.

910
00:46:38.16 --> 00:46:39.16
losses.

911
00:46:39.16 --> 00:46:40.16
That's what I'm going to turn to.

912
00:46:40.16 --> 00:46:44.16
I just said my first tournament and got the floor wiped with me.

913
00:46:44.16 --> 00:46:45.16
Yeah.

914
00:46:45.16 --> 00:46:46.16
Welcome to jiu-jitsu.

915
00:46:46.16 --> 00:46:47.16
Yeah.

916
00:46:47.16 --> 00:46:50.16
The obvious thing is you got to be good.

917
00:46:50.16 --> 00:46:53.16
You learned, I think we've, I think we've gone through that one.

918
00:46:53.16 --> 00:46:54.16
Yeah.

919
00:46:54.16 --> 00:46:56.16
And then really, you know, how did you get beat?

920
00:46:56.16 --> 00:46:57.16
What areas are we?

921
00:46:57.16 --> 00:47:01.16
And then you analyze and improve in those areas.

922
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:03.16
And that's jiu-jitsu, right?

923
00:47:03.16 --> 00:47:10.16
Don't dwell in, in, don't dwell in your loss, but learn from it and move forward.

924
00:47:10.16 --> 00:47:17.16
And actually speaking of Dave Burke, I was talking to Dave Burke.

925
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:25.16
And he was explaining to me his psychological current status in jiu-jitsu.

926
00:47:25.16 --> 00:47:28.16
So he's, however, he's basically my age.

927
00:47:28.16 --> 00:47:31.16
I'm 46, he might be 45 or something like that.

928
00:47:31.16 --> 00:47:39.16
But he's been basically a master of kind of everything he's done.

929
00:47:39.16 --> 00:47:40.16
You know what I mean?

930
00:47:40.16 --> 00:47:51.16
I mean, he's like, like, factually, if you look at his life, he's been top-con, top-con instructor.

931
00:47:51.16 --> 00:48:02.16
He was telling me that during Operation Southern Watch, which was pre, you know, post first call for pre 9-11.

932
00:48:02.16 --> 00:48:10.16
He was the, he was one of the very, very few guys that actually dropped a live bomb.

933
00:48:10.16 --> 00:48:11.16
Yeah.

934
00:48:11.16 --> 00:48:14.16
And, you know, back in the day when no one had an experience.

935
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:17.16
He was like, I either had really, really done it.

936
00:48:17.16 --> 00:48:21.16
Yeah.

937
00:48:21.16 --> 00:48:22.16
And, and then he was top-con, top-con instructor.

938
00:48:22.16 --> 00:48:25.16
You know, you're just, and then F-35, F-22.

939
00:48:25.16 --> 00:48:27.16
Just all that stuff that he's done.

940
00:48:27.16 --> 00:48:33.16
And he was, he was telling me that, like, if he thinks about it, he gets a little bit bummed out.

941
00:48:33.16 --> 00:48:36.16
Because he's just starting jiu-jitsu right now.

942
00:48:36.16 --> 00:48:38.16
Obviously, it's in his head.

943
00:48:38.16 --> 00:48:39.16
Yeah.

944
00:48:39.16 --> 00:48:44.16
And he's thinking, oh, I'm never going to reach the highest level that I should or could.

945
00:48:44.16 --> 00:48:45.16
Yeah.

946
00:48:45.16 --> 00:48:48.16
I, it started younger.

947
00:48:48.16 --> 00:48:52.16
And so he, he, he, he, it's almost like if he thinks about that too much, it's almost like a little bit.

948
00:48:52.16 --> 00:48:53.16
I'm just not going to do it.

949
00:48:53.16 --> 00:48:54.16
Yeah.

950
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:58.16
But he, he, he immediately was like, of course, I know that I'm going to do it.

951
00:48:58.16 --> 00:49:00.16
And I'm going to be as good as I can.

952
00:49:00.16 --> 00:49:07.16
But, you know, that, that's, that's also the way life is, right?

953
00:49:07.16 --> 00:49:08.16
Yeah.

954
00:49:08.16 --> 00:49:10.16
Just like when you, how do you deal with losing in life?

955
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:12.16
You, from your mistakes, you move on.

956
00:49:12.16 --> 00:49:13.16
You don't dwell.

957
00:49:13.16 --> 00:49:15.16
And it's the same thing as you did to you.

958
00:49:15.16 --> 00:49:16.16
Study your weaknesses.

959
00:49:16.16 --> 00:49:17.16
You figure out what you can do.

960
00:49:17.16 --> 00:49:19.16
You fix those problems you move forward.

961
00:49:19.16 --> 00:49:20.16
Don't dwell in the past.

962
00:49:20.16 --> 00:49:21.16
That's it.

963
00:49:21.16 --> 00:49:22.16
Yeah.

964
00:49:22.16 --> 00:49:23.16
That's got to be good.

965
00:49:23.16 --> 00:49:24.16
Yeah.

966
00:49:24.16 --> 00:49:29.16
I actually put into perspective even more, well, okay, so this is just an assumption.

967
00:49:29.16 --> 00:49:30.16
I know.

968
00:49:30.16 --> 00:49:32.16
I just had my first tournament.

969
00:49:32.16 --> 00:49:34.16
I'm assuming white belt.

970
00:49:34.16 --> 00:49:35.16
Maybe blue belt.

971
00:49:35.16 --> 00:49:36.16
Okay.

972
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:37.16
I'm assuming.

973
00:49:37.16 --> 00:49:38.16
Yep.

974
00:49:38.16 --> 00:49:40.16
You know, it just doesn't seem like at brown belt or something.

975
00:49:40.16 --> 00:49:41.16
Yeah, you're not after certain.

976
00:49:41.16 --> 00:49:43.16
You're not after certain.

977
00:49:43.16 --> 00:49:44.16
You're not in your first tournament.

978
00:49:44.16 --> 00:49:45.16
Yeah.

979
00:49:45.16 --> 00:49:46.16
Typically.

980
00:49:46.16 --> 00:49:48.16
But you wouldn't have this in your mind.

981
00:49:48.16 --> 00:49:50.16
How do you deal with loss?

982
00:49:50.16 --> 00:49:52.16
You won't have that in your mind as a brown belt.

983
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:54.16
You know, it's a little bit more clear.

984
00:49:54.16 --> 00:49:55.16
Anyway.

985
00:49:55.16 --> 00:49:59.16
So unless you, this is like scar due for life.

986
00:49:59.16 --> 00:50:02.16
I lost and I'll never compete ever again.

987
00:50:02.16 --> 00:50:03.16
Kind of thing.

988
00:50:03.16 --> 00:50:07.16
I think this is, this is a good way to think of it.

989
00:50:07.16 --> 00:50:08.16
Where?

990
00:50:08.16 --> 00:50:10.16
You know, it's like, I don't know.

991
00:50:10.16 --> 00:50:13.16
Your first girlfriend like junior high or something dumped you.

992
00:50:13.16 --> 00:50:16.16
Like at the time it seems like doing whatever.

993
00:50:16.16 --> 00:50:18.16
And then when you're in the adult, you're like,

994
00:50:18.16 --> 00:50:20.16
Oh, I got something to do.

995
00:50:20.16 --> 00:50:22.16
So like when you're white belt and you lost your first, you know,

996
00:50:22.16 --> 00:50:24.16
as a white belt and you're, you know,

997
00:50:24.16 --> 00:50:26.16
I don't know a blue belt,

998
00:50:26.16 --> 00:50:28.16
pro belt, brown belt, black belt, whatever.

999
00:50:28.16 --> 00:50:29.16
And you're thinking about your first tournament.

1000
00:50:29.16 --> 00:50:31.16
You're like, oh my gosh, who cares?

1001
00:50:31.16 --> 00:50:32.16
It doesn't matter at all.

1002
00:50:32.16 --> 00:50:35.16
And really when you kind of put into perspective,

1003
00:50:35.16 --> 00:50:37.16
unless you want to dedicate your life to competing,

1004
00:50:37.16 --> 00:50:39.16
the tournament's totally amazing.

1005
00:50:39.16 --> 00:50:40.16
It's just fun.

1006
00:50:40.16 --> 00:50:44.16
And if you take the fun out of it by putting everything on that one

1007
00:50:44.16 --> 00:50:45.16
tournament that you're currently doing,

1008
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:47.16
but you won't want to do it.

1009
00:50:47.16 --> 00:50:49.16
And you'll kind of think that that's kind of what

1010
00:50:49.16 --> 00:50:50.16
competing is about.

1011
00:50:50.16 --> 00:50:51.16
It's not.

1012
00:50:51.16 --> 00:50:55.16
So if you're, if you lose your first tournament,

1013
00:50:55.16 --> 00:50:57.16
my first match in my first tournament,

1014
00:50:57.16 --> 00:50:58.16
I lost.

1015
00:50:58.16 --> 00:51:00.16
I think it's a floor wiped with me.

1016
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:02.16
But that's a common thing.

1017
00:51:02.16 --> 00:51:03.16
Yeah.

1018
00:51:03.16 --> 00:51:05.16
You think back on it and not only do you,

1019
00:51:05.16 --> 00:51:07.16
well, I think you'll always remember the first one.

1020
00:51:07.16 --> 00:51:10.16
But it's far as like whether you want it or not,

1021
00:51:10.16 --> 00:51:11.16
it doesn't matter at all.

1022
00:51:11.16 --> 00:51:13.16
Totally doesn't matter at all.

1023
00:51:13.16 --> 00:51:15.16
And you'll find that the more you compete,

1024
00:51:15.16 --> 00:51:16.16
the less it'll matter.

1025
00:51:16.16 --> 00:51:19.16
And then do you just to put competition really,

1026
00:51:19.16 --> 00:51:21.16
unless you're like really dedicating your,

1027
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:23.16
your life to being a, you know,

1028
00:51:23.16 --> 00:51:24.16
a good competitor.

1029
00:51:24.16 --> 00:51:26.16
Do you, do you,

1030
00:51:26.16 --> 00:51:27.16
competitions?

1031
00:51:27.16 --> 00:51:28.16
You're going to win some and you're going to learn.

1032
00:51:28.16 --> 00:51:30.16
Yeah, do some and you're going to win them.

1033
00:51:30.16 --> 00:51:31.16
You're going to learn.

1034
00:51:31.16 --> 00:51:32.16
Yeah.

1035
00:51:32.16 --> 00:51:33.16
And you learn and you learn.

1036
00:51:33.16 --> 00:51:34.16
Oh my gosh, that doesn't work.

1037
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:36.16
If I don't time it correctly or dang,

1038
00:51:36.16 --> 00:51:38.16
that doesn't work because that's not a real submission.

1039
00:51:38.16 --> 00:51:41.16
I only do it to smaller guys and they tap because it's uncomfortable.

1040
00:51:41.16 --> 00:51:42.16
Kind of thing.

1041
00:51:42.16 --> 00:51:43.16
But in the end,

1042
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:44.16
it doesn't even learn these kinds of things, you know,

1043
00:51:44.16 --> 00:51:46.16
but it's not even going to matter.

1044
00:51:46.16 --> 00:51:47.16
Like dealing with a loss.

1045
00:51:47.16 --> 00:51:50.16
It's not even going to be a factor because you're just going to know.

1046
00:51:50.16 --> 00:51:51.16
That's just part of it.

1047
00:51:51.16 --> 00:51:53.16
And really who cares when you're,

1048
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:55.16
it's kind of just starting out, you know.

1049
00:51:55.16 --> 00:51:57.16
Like if you ask,

1050
00:51:57.16 --> 00:52:01.16
like a top level black belt competitor,

1051
00:52:01.16 --> 00:52:02.16
you know,

1052
00:52:02.16 --> 00:52:03.16
did you win?

1053
00:52:03.16 --> 00:52:04.16
Ask Quayler.

1054
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:05.16
Right?

1055
00:52:05.16 --> 00:52:09.16
He tells the story about him and Hoyce,

1056
00:52:09.16 --> 00:52:12.16
and went into their first competition.

1057
00:52:12.16 --> 00:52:14.16
Their dad said,

1058
00:52:14.16 --> 00:52:16.16
if you win,

1059
00:52:16.16 --> 00:52:18.16
I'll give you 10 bucks.

1060
00:52:18.16 --> 00:52:19.16
If you lose,

1061
00:52:19.16 --> 00:52:21.16
I'll give you 20.

1062
00:52:21.16 --> 00:52:23.16
So it takes the pressure off.

1063
00:52:23.16 --> 00:52:25.16
Like it's not that big of a deal.

1064
00:52:25.16 --> 00:52:25.16
You know,

1065
00:52:25.16 --> 00:52:26.16
if you lose, boom, you know,

1066
00:52:26.16 --> 00:52:27.16
it's all good.

1067
00:52:27.16 --> 00:52:28.16
That's what that was for.

1068
00:52:28.16 --> 00:52:30.16
And Hoyler lost.

1069
00:52:30.16 --> 00:52:31.16
Hoyce won,

1070
00:52:31.16 --> 00:52:32.16
Hoyler lost.

1071
00:52:32.16 --> 00:52:33.16
He got the 20 bucks.

1072
00:52:33.16 --> 00:52:34.16
You know,

1073
00:52:34.16 --> 00:52:35.16
Hoyler,

1074
00:52:35.16 --> 00:52:38.16
one of the greatest legendary guys lost his first one.

1075
00:52:38.16 --> 00:52:39.16
Yeah.

1076
00:52:39.16 --> 00:52:40.16
Put it in perspective.

1077
00:52:40.16 --> 00:52:42.16
It doesn't matter at all.

1078
00:52:42.16 --> 00:52:43.16
It got 20 dollars.

1079
00:52:43.16 --> 00:52:45.16
I don't know.

1080
00:52:45.16 --> 00:52:46.16
It's going to get the 20 bucks.

1081
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:49.16
But just it doesn't matter.

1082
00:52:49.16 --> 00:52:50.16
It won't matter.

1083
00:52:50.16 --> 00:52:52.16
And you're going to think same thing like high school,

1084
00:52:52.16 --> 00:52:53.16
like the stuff that happened in high school,

1085
00:52:53.16 --> 00:52:54.16
when it happens,

1086
00:52:54.16 --> 00:52:55.16
it seems like it's a big deal.

1087
00:52:55.16 --> 00:52:56.16
But then when you're in adult,

1088
00:52:56.16 --> 00:52:57.16
you're like,

1089
00:52:57.16 --> 00:52:58.16
it doesn't happen to the adult.

1090
00:52:58.16 --> 00:52:59.16
Cool.

1091
00:52:59.16 --> 00:53:00.16
It's a cool memory.

1092
00:53:00.16 --> 00:53:01.16
But, you know,

1093
00:53:01.16 --> 00:53:03.16
I've been better.

1094
00:53:03.16 --> 00:53:04.16
You know,

1095
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:05.16
next question.

1096
00:53:05.16 --> 00:53:07.16
Hello, Mr. Whilling.

1097
00:53:07.16 --> 00:53:10.16
I'm currently deployed to Iraq as an E6 in the army.

1098
00:53:10.16 --> 00:53:13.16
I have listened to your podcasts and really enjoy your stuff.

1099
00:53:13.16 --> 00:53:15.16
Especially different disciplines for you.

1100
00:53:15.16 --> 00:53:17.16
I know as a sergeant and as a leader,

1101
00:53:17.16 --> 00:53:19.16
your focus isn't to be liked.

1102
00:53:19.16 --> 00:53:21.16
However, your soldiers should respect you,

1103
00:53:21.16 --> 00:53:24.16
respect both you and your rank.

1104
00:53:24.16 --> 00:53:25.16
My question is,

1105
00:53:25.16 --> 00:53:28.16
how do you tell your soldiers to do the small stuff,

1106
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:29.16
tedious stuff,

1107
00:53:29.16 --> 00:53:31.16
like taking out the trash,

1108
00:53:31.16 --> 00:53:33.16
and still be liked?

1109
00:53:33.16 --> 00:53:34.16
All right.

1110
00:53:34.16 --> 00:53:35.16
Well, first of all,

1111
00:53:35.16 --> 00:53:38.16
if we want to get respect from people,

1112
00:53:38.16 --> 00:53:40.16
we have to give them respect,

1113
00:53:40.16 --> 00:53:41.16
for sure.

1114
00:53:41.16 --> 00:53:42.16
Think about this.

1115
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:44.16
Think if you took out the trash sometime.

1116
00:53:44.16 --> 00:53:45.16
You know,

1117
00:53:45.16 --> 00:53:46.16
think if you're the boss,

1118
00:53:46.16 --> 00:53:48.16
but you see that the trash is getting no fulfillment,

1119
00:53:48.16 --> 00:53:50.16
you just grab it and take it out.

1120
00:53:50.16 --> 00:53:52.16
There's to think about what that does.

1121
00:53:52.16 --> 00:53:53.16
Think about what that does,

1122
00:53:53.16 --> 00:53:55.16
the attitude of the guys.

1123
00:53:55.16 --> 00:53:58.16
If you took out the trash,

1124
00:53:58.16 --> 00:53:59.16
you,

1125
00:53:59.16 --> 00:54:01.16
maybe in your mind,

1126
00:54:01.16 --> 00:54:03.16
you think you'd be losing respect.

1127
00:54:03.16 --> 00:54:05.16
But you actually wouldn't be at all.

1128
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:07.16
In fact, everyone looks at you and goes,

1129
00:54:07.16 --> 00:54:08.16
oh, he's a good guy.

1130
00:54:08.16 --> 00:54:09.16
He's taking out the trash.

1131
00:54:09.16 --> 00:54:10.16
It was a little full.

1132
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:12.16
Then he's taking care of it.

1133
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:13.16
So,

1134
00:54:13.16 --> 00:54:14.16
maybe if you're insecure,

1135
00:54:14.16 --> 00:54:15.16
you'd think you lose respect,

1136
00:54:15.16 --> 00:54:17.16
but I think if you're secure and your ability to lead it,

1137
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:21.16
and if you know that doing some tedious stuff,

1138
00:54:21.16 --> 00:54:23.16
is going to make you guys appreciate you,

1139
00:54:23.16 --> 00:54:25.16
then to me,

1140
00:54:25.16 --> 00:54:26.16
that means it's kind of worth it.

1141
00:54:26.16 --> 00:54:27.16
Yeah,

1142
00:54:27.16 --> 00:54:29.16
that's absolutely right.

1143
00:54:29.16 --> 00:54:30.16
Another example,

1144
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:31.16
you know, we talk about taking out the trash,

1145
00:54:31.16 --> 00:54:32.16
but like,

1146
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:35.16
what if the platoon space has to be cleaned?

1147
00:54:35.16 --> 00:54:37.16
And on Friday,

1148
00:54:37.16 --> 00:54:38.16
you just say,

1149
00:54:38.16 --> 00:54:39.16
hey guys,

1150
00:54:39.16 --> 00:54:41.16
you guys can go and roll out.

1151
00:54:41.16 --> 00:54:42.16
I got this.

1152
00:54:42.16 --> 00:54:44.16
Right?

1153
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:45.16
There's a chance they're like,

1154
00:54:45.16 --> 00:54:46.16
hey boss,

1155
00:54:46.16 --> 00:54:47.16
we're not leaving.

1156
00:54:47.16 --> 00:54:47.16
Yeah,

1157
00:54:47.16 --> 00:54:48.16
yeah.

1158
00:54:48.16 --> 00:54:49.16
No,

1159
00:54:49.16 --> 00:54:50.16
we'll help you.

1160
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:52.16
There's course there's a chance they're like,

1161
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:52.16
oh,

1162
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:53.16
that's awesome.

1163
00:54:53.16 --> 00:54:54.16
Thanks boss.

1164
00:54:54.16 --> 00:54:55.16
And they bail.

1165
00:54:55.16 --> 00:54:56.16
Over time.

1166
00:54:56.16 --> 00:54:58.16
That might be if they don't respect you,

1167
00:54:58.16 --> 00:54:59.16
at all,

1168
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:00.16
they might bail.

1169
00:55:00.16 --> 00:55:01.16
Now,

1170
00:55:01.16 --> 00:55:03.16
in order to regain the respect,

1171
00:55:03.16 --> 00:55:05.16
do you make them stay and boss them around?

1172
00:55:05.16 --> 00:55:07.16
Or does that increase the respect for you?

1173
00:55:07.16 --> 00:55:09.16
You see how it is interesting it is?

1174
00:55:09.16 --> 00:55:10.16
Yeah.

1175
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:11.16
Is that if you go,

1176
00:55:11.16 --> 00:55:12.16
hey guys,

1177
00:55:12.16 --> 00:55:13.16
that's cool.

1178
00:55:13.16 --> 00:55:14.16
I'll do it.

1179
00:55:14.16 --> 00:55:16.16
And you're working hard,

1180
00:55:16.16 --> 00:55:18.16
and you still got to maintain the discipline,

1181
00:55:18.16 --> 00:55:20.16
and you don't take any slack,

1182
00:55:20.16 --> 00:55:21.16
but at the,

1183
00:55:21.16 --> 00:55:22.16
you,

1184
00:55:22.16 --> 00:55:23.16
it's the same balance.

1185
00:55:23.16 --> 00:55:25.16
The balance we talk about all the time.

1186
00:55:25.16 --> 00:55:27.16
So,

1187
00:55:27.16 --> 00:55:29.16
the more that you treat them with respect,

1188
00:55:29.16 --> 00:55:31.16
the more they're going to respect you,

1189
00:55:31.16 --> 00:55:34.16
and they're going to know that you're not,

1190
00:55:34.16 --> 00:55:35.16
you know,

1191
00:55:35.16 --> 00:55:37.16
too high at mighty.

1192
00:55:37.16 --> 00:55:39.16
They're going to know that you're down to earth.

1193
00:55:39.16 --> 00:55:40.16
When I was a,

1194
00:55:40.16 --> 00:55:42.16
a tune commander task commander,

1195
00:55:42.16 --> 00:55:43.16
I picked up brass.

1196
00:55:43.16 --> 00:55:45.16
I cleaned the ranges with the boys.

1197
00:55:45.16 --> 00:55:47.16
That's just the way I operated.

1198
00:55:47.16 --> 00:55:50.16
And I would recommend that kind of attitude.

1199
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:52.16
It didn't make people think that.

1200
00:55:52.16 --> 00:55:55.16
Oh, jockels does not have anything better to do.

1201
00:55:55.16 --> 00:55:57.16
They actually knew I had stuff to do.

1202
00:55:57.16 --> 00:55:59.16
But what I got to do,

1203
00:55:59.16 --> 00:56:01.16
pick up brass with the boys,

1204
00:56:01.16 --> 00:56:02.16
build the relationships,

1205
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:03.16
set the example.

1206
00:56:03.16 --> 00:56:05.16
They're going to respect you for it.

1207
00:56:05.16 --> 00:56:06.16
Yeah, makes sense.

1208
00:56:06.16 --> 00:56:07.16
At the end of the day,

1209
00:56:07.16 --> 00:56:09.16
do you have something better to do,

1210
00:56:09.16 --> 00:56:10.16
because the whole,

1211
00:56:10.16 --> 00:56:11.16
in the big picture,

1212
00:56:11.16 --> 00:56:12.16
it's like,

1213
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:12.16
how you say,

1214
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:13.16
like,

1215
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:13.16
that's a leader.

1216
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:14.16
Yeah.

1217
00:56:14.16 --> 00:56:16.16
Sometimes you literally have something.

1218
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:17.16
They're literally,

1219
00:56:17.16 --> 00:56:18.16
you know,

1220
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:20.16
like sometimes you literally have something.

1221
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:21.16
Yeah.

1222
00:56:21.16 --> 00:56:22.16
And sometimes you literally,

1223
00:56:22.16 --> 00:56:24.16
the boys are picking up brass and guess what?

1224
00:56:24.16 --> 00:56:26.16
You got a meeting with the commanding officer.

1225
00:56:26.16 --> 00:56:27.16
You got to go do,

1226
00:56:27.16 --> 00:56:28.16
you know,

1227
00:56:28.16 --> 00:56:30.16
sometimes you actually do.

1228
00:56:30.16 --> 00:56:31.16
And what's cool is,

1229
00:56:31.16 --> 00:56:33.16
tactically,

1230
00:56:33.16 --> 00:56:34.16
is,

1231
00:56:34.16 --> 00:56:35.16
and you heard us saying this at the,

1232
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:37.16
FTX and we're up in Utah.

1233
00:56:37.16 --> 00:56:40.16
If you see the leader doing something

1234
00:56:40.16 --> 00:56:41.16
meanial,

1235
00:56:41.16 --> 00:56:42.16
what you should do is as a,

1236
00:56:42.16 --> 00:56:44.16
as a followers step up and say,

1237
00:56:44.16 --> 00:56:45.16
hey, echo,

1238
00:56:45.16 --> 00:56:46.16
I got this.

1239
00:56:46.16 --> 00:56:47.16
You can go and lead.

1240
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:48.16
That's what you want.

1241
00:56:48.16 --> 00:56:49.16
That's what I want to do for my leader.

1242
00:56:49.16 --> 00:56:52.16
I want to take things off my leaders plate as much as possible.

1243
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:53.16
Yeah.

1244
00:56:53.16 --> 00:56:54.16
Now,

1245
00:56:54.16 --> 00:56:58.16
the more you try and,

1246
00:56:58.16 --> 00:57:00.16
you just have to build those relationships.

1247
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:01.16
The way to build those,

1248
00:57:01.16 --> 00:57:02.16
if you don't have anything better to do,

1249
00:57:02.16 --> 00:57:04.16
then you get down there and you help,

1250
00:57:04.16 --> 00:57:05.16
you help clean up the range.

1251
00:57:05.16 --> 00:57:06.16
You help pick up the brass.

1252
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:07.16
Yeah.

1253
00:57:07.16 --> 00:57:08.16
That's the way it is.

1254
00:57:08.16 --> 00:57:10.16
I actually did notice that about you and

1255
00:57:10.16 --> 00:57:11.16
life too,

1256
00:57:11.16 --> 00:57:12.16
where,

1257
00:57:12.16 --> 00:57:13.16
you know,

1258
00:57:13.16 --> 00:57:15.16
like I'll have my camera equipment and,

1259
00:57:15.16 --> 00:57:16.16
you know, light or whatever.

1260
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:18.16
And it's not a bunch of stuff,

1261
00:57:18.16 --> 00:57:19.16
but, you know,

1262
00:57:19.16 --> 00:57:20.16
you're always like,

1263
00:57:20.16 --> 00:57:21.16
you're like,

1264
00:57:21.16 --> 00:57:22.16
grab something.

1265
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:22.16
Yeah.

1266
00:57:22.16 --> 00:57:23.16
And you don't like it.

1267
00:57:23.16 --> 00:57:24.16
If you're camera equipment.

1268
00:57:24.16 --> 00:57:24.16
Yeah.

1269
00:57:24.16 --> 00:57:25.16
Don't touch it.

1270
00:57:25.16 --> 00:57:26.16
Don't touch it.

1271
00:57:26.16 --> 00:57:27.16
But,

1272
00:57:27.16 --> 00:57:28.16
and when it's just me and you,

1273
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:30.16
it's kind of like cool because we're just kind of friends or whatever.

1274
00:57:30.16 --> 00:57:33.16
There's no perceived or no,

1275
00:57:33.16 --> 00:57:34.16
like,

1276
00:57:34.16 --> 00:57:35.16
hierarchy kind of thing.

1277
00:57:35.16 --> 00:57:36.16
Like you're,

1278
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:36.16
you know,

1279
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:38.16
but let's say like at the master,

1280
00:57:38.16 --> 00:57:39.16
whatever.

1281
00:57:39.16 --> 00:57:40.16
It's like you guys have a,

1282
00:57:40.16 --> 00:57:41.16
a specific job.

1283
00:57:41.16 --> 00:57:42.16
I have a specific job,

1284
00:57:42.16 --> 00:57:43.16
you know, kind of thing.

1285
00:57:43.16 --> 00:57:44.16
And meanwhile,

1286
00:57:44.16 --> 00:57:45.16
you and,

1287
00:57:45.16 --> 00:57:46.16
and life,

1288
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:48.16
well, like if,

1289
00:57:48.16 --> 00:57:49.16
if I'm around,

1290
00:57:49.16 --> 00:57:50.16
I'm carrying something.

1291
00:57:50.16 --> 00:57:51.16
You'll always like grab something or I say,

1292
00:57:51.16 --> 00:57:52.16
hey, you need, you know,

1293
00:57:52.16 --> 00:57:53.16
you know,

1294
00:57:53.16 --> 00:57:54.16
you don't have to,

1295
00:57:54.16 --> 00:57:55.16
you talk things.

1296
00:57:55.16 --> 00:57:55.16
You're like,

1297
00:57:55.16 --> 00:57:55.16
oh,

1298
00:57:55.16 --> 00:57:56.16
are you good?

1299
00:57:56.16 --> 00:57:56.16
I'm like,

1300
00:57:56.16 --> 00:57:56.16
bro,

1301
00:57:56.16 --> 00:57:57.16
you're the instructor here.

1302
00:57:57.16 --> 00:57:58.16
Kind of the,

1303
00:57:58.16 --> 00:57:59.16
that's what I'm thinking of my head.

1304
00:57:59.16 --> 00:58:00.16
And,

1305
00:58:00.16 --> 00:58:01.16
and yeah,

1306
00:58:01.16 --> 00:58:03.16
because I always offered it like help.

1307
00:58:03.16 --> 00:58:04.16
Interesting.

1308
00:58:04.16 --> 00:58:06.16
I'm like almost offended like,

1309
00:58:06.16 --> 00:58:07.16
bro,

1310
00:58:07.16 --> 00:58:07.16
like,

1311
00:58:07.16 --> 00:58:08.16
do I look like I need help?

1312
00:58:08.16 --> 00:58:10.16
Cause you shouldn't really be asking me for

1313
00:58:10.16 --> 00:58:11.16
kind of.

1314
00:58:11.16 --> 00:58:12.16
There we're,

1315
00:58:12.16 --> 00:58:14.16
very capable individual.

1316
00:58:14.16 --> 00:58:15.16
Yeah.

1317
00:58:15.16 --> 00:58:16.16
And,

1318
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:18.16
this small,

1319
00:58:18.16 --> 00:58:19.16
tedious stuff.

1320
00:58:19.16 --> 00:58:21.16
The other thing is you explain to him why it's important.

1321
00:58:21.16 --> 00:58:22.16
Right?

1322
00:58:22.16 --> 00:58:24.16
That's what we give all the time.

1323
00:58:24.16 --> 00:58:25.16
Why is it important?

1324
00:58:25.16 --> 00:58:27.16
Why is important that the ploon hut's clean?

1325
00:58:27.16 --> 00:58:27.16
Well,

1326
00:58:27.16 --> 00:58:30.16
cause I want you guys to have time off over the weekends and not be stuck here.

1327
00:58:30.16 --> 00:58:34.16
Cleaned in because the commanding officer came in and saw that this place looked like a hellhole.

1328
00:58:34.16 --> 00:58:35.16
Okay.

1329
00:58:35.16 --> 00:58:35.16
Well,

1330
00:58:35.16 --> 00:58:36.16
that makes sense to us.

1331
00:58:36.16 --> 00:58:38.16
We understand why you want us to clean now.

1332
00:58:38.16 --> 00:58:38.16
You,

1333
00:58:38.16 --> 00:58:41.16
you want us to clean so that we can.

1334
00:58:41.16 --> 00:58:42.16
Have time off.

1335
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:44.16
You want us to clean so you want us to train hard.

1336
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:46.16
We want us to do this because because we want to be ready for combat.

1337
00:58:46.16 --> 00:58:49.16
Cause I want you guys to be able to come home to your families.

1338
00:58:49.16 --> 00:58:52.16
Make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing.

1339
00:58:52.16 --> 00:58:54.16
And if there's no reason why,

1340
00:58:54.16 --> 00:58:55.16
if, if, if, if the reason,

1341
00:58:55.16 --> 00:58:57.16
I mean, even cleaning even taking out the trash,

1342
00:58:57.16 --> 00:58:58.16
there's a reason for that, right?

1343
00:58:58.16 --> 00:58:59.16
There's an actual reason for that.

1344
00:58:59.16 --> 00:59:02.16
We can't just have junk everywhere.

1345
00:59:02.16 --> 00:59:04.16
So,

1346
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:06.16
explain why

1347
00:59:06.16 --> 00:59:08.16
participate when you can.

1348
00:59:08.16 --> 00:59:11.16
Build relationships with your troops.

1349
00:59:11.16 --> 00:59:12.16
You'll be good.

1350
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:13.16
Yeah.

1351
00:59:13.16 --> 00:59:15.16
That, that works for you.

1352
00:59:15.16 --> 00:59:17.16
And by the way, thanks for your service, brother.

1353
00:59:17.16 --> 00:59:20.16
I hope you have a good time over in Iraq, getting after it.

1354
00:59:20.16 --> 00:59:23.16
Yeah, second that, for sure.

1355
00:59:23.16 --> 00:59:25.16
That works for kids.

1356
00:59:25.16 --> 00:59:26.16
Big time.

1357
00:59:26.16 --> 00:59:27.16
Explaining why you do it.

1358
00:59:27.16 --> 00:59:31.16
And if you really want to dial in the effectiveness

1359
00:59:31.16 --> 00:59:33.16
is make that reason somehow.

1360
00:59:33.16 --> 00:59:36.16
Tie it to their interests.

1361
00:59:36.16 --> 00:59:38.16
They're direct interests.

1362
00:59:38.16 --> 00:59:40.16
Cause sometimes kids can't see the big picture.

1363
00:59:40.16 --> 00:59:41.16
You know,

1364
00:59:41.16 --> 00:59:43.16
like if I say, you got to clean your room.

1365
00:59:43.16 --> 00:59:46.16
And, you know, otherwise your room would be messy.

1366
00:59:46.16 --> 00:59:48.16
And then maybe, you know,

1367
00:59:48.16 --> 00:59:52.16
um, later in life, you might be comfortable with a mess

1368
00:59:52.16 --> 00:59:54.16
room, like getting the way of your effectiveness.

1369
00:59:54.16 --> 00:59:55.16
It's a little four or five year old.

1370
00:59:55.16 --> 00:59:56.16
They're not going to understand that.

1371
00:59:56.16 --> 00:59:57.16
They're going to be like, cool.

1372
00:59:57.16 --> 00:59:59.16
That sounds like terrible, but they won't feel it.

1373
00:59:59.16 --> 01:00:00.16
You know?

1374
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:03.16
But if you tie it into their like direct interests

1375
01:00:03.16 --> 01:00:06.16
as a four or five year old or however old the kid is,

1376
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:09.16
it works really good.

1377
01:00:09.16 --> 01:00:11.16
What if you don't clean your room and there's a fire

1378
01:00:11.16 --> 01:00:12.16
and I come in here to get you,

1379
01:00:12.16 --> 01:00:14.16
but I trip and fall down and then you die.

1380
01:00:14.16 --> 01:00:18.16
That's one way.

1381
01:00:18.16 --> 01:00:19.16
Yeah.

1382
01:00:19.16 --> 01:00:19.16
Yeah.

1383
01:00:19.16 --> 01:00:20.16
For sure.

1384
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:21.16
All right.

1385
01:00:21.16 --> 01:00:24.16
I don't know if I'd say that, but it's cool.

1386
01:00:24.16 --> 01:00:25.16
Good time for one more here.

1387
01:00:25.16 --> 01:00:26.16
Yeah.

1388
01:00:26.16 --> 01:00:27.16
Thanks, Suva.

1389
01:00:27.16 --> 01:00:29.16
Jocco.

1390
01:00:29.16 --> 01:00:31.16
In war,

1391
01:00:31.16 --> 01:00:32.16
the enemy is clear,

1392
01:00:32.16 --> 01:00:35.16
but in life, in business.

1393
01:00:35.16 --> 01:00:38.16
That's a easy to identify.

1394
01:00:38.16 --> 01:00:39.16
Any tips?

1395
01:00:42.16 --> 01:00:43.16
Well,

1396
01:00:45.16 --> 01:00:46.16
I mean, first of all,

1397
01:00:46.16 --> 01:00:49.16
that is not a true statement.

1398
01:00:49.16 --> 01:00:51.16
And in war,

1399
01:00:51.16 --> 01:00:53.16
the enemy is not always clear,

1400
01:00:53.16 --> 01:00:54.16
not at all.

1401
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:55.16
The enemy,

1402
01:00:55.16 --> 01:00:58.16
the enemy can be hard to identify.

1403
01:00:58.16 --> 01:01:00.16
Very hard to identify.

1404
01:01:00.16 --> 01:01:02.16
The enemy is going to use camouflage

1405
01:01:02.16 --> 01:01:03.16
to conceal themselves.

1406
01:01:03.16 --> 01:01:06.16
They're going to use deception

1407
01:01:06.16 --> 01:01:09.16
to distract your attention.

1408
01:01:09.16 --> 01:01:12.16
They're going to blend in with the friendly civilian and

1409
01:01:12.16 --> 01:01:15.16
populist and they're going to take advantage of your benevolence.

1410
01:01:15.16 --> 01:01:17.16
Right?

1411
01:01:17.16 --> 01:01:19.16
In fact,

1412
01:01:19.16 --> 01:01:23.16
the enemy is going to do absolutely everything in its power

1413
01:01:23.16 --> 01:01:28.16
to obscure their position to hide their purpose

1414
01:01:28.16 --> 01:01:31.16
to even mask their identity.

1415
01:01:31.16 --> 01:01:33.16
So,

1416
01:01:33.16 --> 01:01:37.16
it is not easy to identify the enemy.

1417
01:01:37.16 --> 01:01:39.16
In combat,

1418
01:01:39.16 --> 01:01:40.16
in war.

1419
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:42.16
So, what you have to do is you have to control

1420
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:44.16
what you can control.

1421
01:01:44.16 --> 01:01:45.16
Right?

1422
01:01:45.16 --> 01:01:46.16
You've got to be prepared.

1423
01:01:46.16 --> 01:01:47.16
You've got to train.

1424
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:48.16
You've got to study.

1425
01:01:48.16 --> 01:01:49.16
You've got to rehearse.

1426
01:01:49.16 --> 01:01:51.16
You've got to remain vigilant.

1427
01:01:51.16 --> 01:01:55.16
You've got to maintain discipline

1428
01:01:55.16 --> 01:01:57.16
and everything you do so that when the enemy

1429
01:01:57.16 --> 01:01:59.16
does reveal itself,

1430
01:01:59.16 --> 01:02:01.16
you have the ability

1431
01:02:01.16 --> 01:02:04.16
to outthink it,

1432
01:02:04.16 --> 01:02:06.16
to outmaneuver,

1433
01:02:06.16 --> 01:02:10.16
to outfight the enemy.

1434
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:13.16
And it's actually the same thing in business.

1435
01:02:13.16 --> 01:02:14.16
Right?

1436
01:02:14.16 --> 01:02:16.16
The enemy can be hard to identify.

1437
01:02:16.16 --> 01:02:22.16
Your competitors aren't broadcasting their next move.

1438
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:24.16
You don't know what the market's going to do.

1439
01:02:24.16 --> 01:02:26.16
You can't be certain about the next trend

1440
01:02:26.16 --> 01:02:28.16
or the next downturn to the next bubble

1441
01:02:28.16 --> 01:02:29.16
that's going to burst.

1442
01:02:29.16 --> 01:02:31.16
You can't know those things.

1443
01:02:31.16 --> 01:02:32.16
So you have to do the same thing

1444
01:02:32.16 --> 01:02:35.16
if the control what you can control.

1445
01:02:35.16 --> 01:02:37.16
Which is you.

1446
01:02:37.16 --> 01:02:39.16
You've got to gather intelligence.

1447
01:02:39.16 --> 01:02:42.16
You've got to analyze the metrics that you can track.

1448
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:44.16
You've got to train yourself

1449
01:02:44.16 --> 01:02:46.16
and your team to be prepared

1450
01:02:46.16 --> 01:02:51.16
for both the known and also be prepared for the unknown.

1451
01:02:51.16 --> 01:02:56.16
Figure out what the likely contingencies are.

1452
01:02:56.16 --> 01:03:00.16
Then have some plans

1453
01:03:00.16 --> 01:03:03.16
to execute if those contingencies occur.

1454
01:03:03.16 --> 01:03:06.16
Maintain discipline as an organization

1455
01:03:06.16 --> 01:03:08.16
so that you have the flexibility

1456
01:03:08.16 --> 01:03:12.16
and the responsiveness to maneuver effectively and efficiently.

1457
01:03:12.16 --> 01:03:15.16
When the unpredictable actually happens

1458
01:03:15.16 --> 01:03:17.16
so instead of suffering

1459
01:03:17.16 --> 01:03:19.16
and falling apart in the chaos

1460
01:03:19.16 --> 01:03:26.16
you can take advantage of it and win.

1461
01:03:26.16 --> 01:03:30.16
And that's business and life is the same.

1462
01:03:30.16 --> 01:03:33.16
The enemy is not always clear in life.

1463
01:03:33.16 --> 01:03:39.16
It can be hard to tell who's going to try and bring you down.

1464
01:03:39.16 --> 01:03:41.16
Or what is going to bring you down?

1465
01:03:41.16 --> 01:03:44.16
There's distractions.

1466
01:03:44.16 --> 01:03:47.16
There are things out there that will do you harm

1467
01:03:47.16 --> 01:03:50.16
that are so camouflaged.

1468
01:03:50.16 --> 01:03:54.16
You can't see them at all.

1469
01:03:54.16 --> 01:03:58.16
There are deceitful people.

1470
01:03:58.16 --> 01:04:01.16
There are accidents that can occur.

1471
01:04:01.16 --> 01:04:03.16
And diseases that take root

1472
01:04:03.16 --> 01:04:06.16
and there's bad luck and there's Murphy's law

1473
01:04:06.16 --> 01:04:08.16
and there's times when it seems

1474
01:04:08.16 --> 01:04:12.16
that the whole world is against you.

1475
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:16.16
The whole world is the enemy.

1476
01:04:16.16 --> 01:04:20.16
And the same rules apply.

1477
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:23.16
Control what you can't control.

1478
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:25.16
You train hard.

1479
01:04:25.16 --> 01:04:26.16
Learn.

1480
01:04:26.16 --> 01:04:34.16
Maintain the unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

1481
01:04:34.16 --> 01:04:37.16
Train hard physically and mentally.

1482
01:04:37.16 --> 01:04:41.16
Push yourself so hard that you become accustomed

1483
01:04:41.16 --> 01:04:48.16
to the stress you get used to it.

1484
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:56.16
Every day make yourself stronger and faster and smarter

1485
01:04:56.16 --> 01:05:00.16
and better so that when the enemy does

1486
01:05:00.16 --> 01:05:05.16
finally climb out of the shadows and expose himself to you

1487
01:05:05.16 --> 01:05:08.16
you already.

1488
01:05:08.16 --> 01:05:13.16
You are waiting.

1489
01:05:13.16 --> 01:05:17.16
And you can relish in the opportunity

1490
01:05:17.16 --> 01:05:22.16
to attack and fight and utterly

1491
01:05:22.16 --> 01:05:29.16
decimate and destroy him.

1492
01:05:29.16 --> 01:05:35.16
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1493
01:05:35.16 --> 01:05:39.16
So echo.

1494
01:05:39.16 --> 01:05:45.16
Maybe you could help us figure out

1495
01:05:45.16 --> 01:05:49.16
how we can support ourselves and perhaps

1496
01:05:49.16 --> 01:05:53.16
be better prepared for the enemy

1497
01:05:53.16 --> 01:05:56.16
of whichever kind.

1498
01:05:56.16 --> 01:05:59.16
And whenever it exposes itself

1499
01:05:59.16 --> 01:06:01.16
so that we can smash it.

1500
01:06:01.16 --> 01:06:06.16
And if you want to do that, you can also do that while simultaneously supporting

1501
01:06:06.16 --> 01:06:09.16
this podcast.

1502
01:06:09.16 --> 01:06:10.16
Of course.

1503
01:06:10.16 --> 01:06:13.16
Or we could just have a bunch of advertisers on here

1504
01:06:13.16 --> 01:06:16.16
and listen to us talk about stuff that.

1505
01:06:16.16 --> 01:06:17.16
Sure.

1506
01:06:17.16 --> 01:06:18.16
Yeah.

1507
01:06:18.16 --> 01:06:19.16
Yeah, either way.

1508
01:06:19.16 --> 01:06:21.16
Hey, what I'm here to do.

1509
01:06:21.16 --> 01:06:24.16
One of the things I was talking to actually

1510
01:06:24.16 --> 01:06:28.16
that's true that where you know how.

1511
01:06:28.16 --> 01:06:30.16
You know, you say that a lot and it's easy,

1512
01:06:30.16 --> 01:06:31.16
especially me.

1513
01:06:31.16 --> 01:06:32.16
What do I say a lot?

1514
01:06:32.16 --> 01:06:34.16
Like be ready, you know.

1515
01:06:34.16 --> 01:06:35.16
Yeah.

1516
01:06:35.16 --> 01:06:36.16
Yeah, prepare.

1517
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:37.16
Yeah.

1518
01:06:37.16 --> 01:06:38.16
Stronger faster, smarter.

1519
01:06:38.16 --> 01:06:40.16
And you don't like a lot of things after a while.

1520
01:06:40.16 --> 01:06:41.16
You hear it like enough.

1521
01:06:41.16 --> 01:06:43.16
A lot of times, a lot of times,

1522
01:06:43.16 --> 01:06:46.16
sometimes it clicks, but then

1523
01:06:46.16 --> 01:06:48.16
everyone's in a while you'll it'll like.

1524
01:06:48.16 --> 01:06:50.16
Leave a mark.

1525
01:06:50.16 --> 01:06:51.16
No, I don't know the opposite.

1526
01:06:51.16 --> 01:06:52.16
Sorry.

1527
01:06:52.16 --> 01:06:54.16
The opposite like, okay.

1528
01:06:54.16 --> 01:06:55.16
Yeah.

1529
01:06:55.16 --> 01:06:56.16
I get it.

1530
01:06:56.16 --> 01:06:57.16
I get it.

1531
01:06:57.16 --> 01:06:58.16
I get it.

1532
01:06:58.16 --> 01:07:01.16
And these things like when you really think about that one,

1533
01:07:01.16 --> 01:07:03.16
like we, there's this saying, I don't know.

1534
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:05.16
I'm sure it's not new when I heard it.

1535
01:07:05.16 --> 01:07:08.16
It was like chance favors the prepared man.

1536
01:07:08.16 --> 01:07:12.16
Is that the correct fortune favors the brave.

1537
01:07:12.16 --> 01:07:13.16
Wait, wait.

1538
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:14.16
What are you looking for?

1539
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:15.16
That that quote.

1540
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:16.16
Yeah.

1541
01:07:16.16 --> 01:07:16.16
Yeah.

1542
01:07:16.16 --> 01:07:17.16
It's like basically some chance favor.

1543
01:07:17.16 --> 01:07:20.16
They'll the one that I heard was chance favors the prepared man.

1544
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:21.16
Yeah.

1545
01:07:21.16 --> 01:07:21.16
Yeah.

1546
01:07:21.16 --> 01:07:22.16
For sure.

1547
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:22.16
So it's all.

1548
01:07:22.16 --> 01:07:23.16
There's some variations of that one.

1549
01:07:23.16 --> 01:07:26.16
I wouldn't straight to the fortune favors the bold or brave.

1550
01:07:26.16 --> 01:07:27.16
Yeah.

1551
01:07:27.16 --> 01:07:28.16
Yeah.

1552
01:07:28.16 --> 01:07:29.16
Well, it's prepared.

1553
01:07:29.16 --> 01:07:29.16
Right.

1554
01:07:29.16 --> 01:07:34.16
So if you're the shared, you know, you're going to seem to have more luck.

1555
01:07:34.16 --> 01:07:37.16
You know, with victory and all this other stuff.

1556
01:07:37.16 --> 01:07:38.16
Right.

1557
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:49.16
So it's like, you know, and any circumstances like if you take working out working out is like the easy one because like if you're in shape or you're if you're strong or if you're not weak or if you're not incapable, you know like you don't work out.

1558
01:07:49.16 --> 01:07:51.16
So you're back out or something like that or.

1559
01:07:51.16 --> 01:07:53.16
Compared with being strong.

1560
01:07:53.16 --> 01:07:56.16
Being strong is always more beneficial.

1561
01:07:56.16 --> 01:08:03.16
And pretty much every single situation being there is then being with yes or being in shape or you know being healthy.

1562
01:08:03.16 --> 01:08:04.16
Mm-hmm.

1563
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:05.16
Being smarter.

1564
01:08:05.16 --> 01:08:06.16
Being smarter.

1565
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:07.16
Yeah.

1566
01:08:07.16 --> 01:08:08.16
Yeah.

1567
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:09.16
Yeah.

1568
01:08:09.16 --> 01:08:11.16
What you hesitate about it's it's always good to be strong.

1569
01:08:11.16 --> 01:08:12.16
Yeah.

1570
01:08:12.16 --> 01:08:13.16
Occasionally it's good to be gummer.

1571
01:08:13.16 --> 01:08:14.16
No.

1572
01:08:14.16 --> 01:08:15.16
That's it.

1573
01:08:15.16 --> 01:08:16.16
It's not one of the.

1574
01:08:16.16 --> 01:08:22.16
It's one of those things where where the result of working out and being strong is always going to add a tangible benefit to most of this.

1575
01:08:22.16 --> 01:08:23.16
Pretty much everything you do.

1576
01:08:23.16 --> 01:08:24.16
Yeah.

1577
01:08:24.16 --> 01:08:25.16
And you don't know about being smarter.

1578
01:08:25.16 --> 01:08:26.16
Yeah.

1579
01:08:26.16 --> 01:08:27.16
I'm not saying that.

1580
01:08:27.16 --> 01:08:28.16
I'm not just going to jump into yes.

1581
01:08:28.16 --> 01:08:30.16
That's true too because I didn't think about it.

1582
01:08:30.16 --> 01:08:31.16
I thought that's not about this.

1583
01:08:31.16 --> 01:08:33.16
Oh, that's just my move of yours.

1584
01:08:33.16 --> 01:08:35.16
See there you go.

1585
01:08:35.16 --> 01:08:36.16
Well.

1586
01:08:36.16 --> 01:08:40.16
Nonetheless, but I think that's one of those things where.

1587
01:08:40.16 --> 01:08:41.16
We kind of.

1588
01:08:41.16 --> 01:08:46.16
It's my opinion that what you just said there is should be taken to heart.

1589
01:08:46.16 --> 01:08:47.16
100%.

1590
01:08:47.16 --> 01:08:48.16
Concure.

1591
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:49.16
Yeah.

1592
01:08:49.16 --> 01:08:51.16
Not just some cool thing like let's face it.

1593
01:08:51.16 --> 01:08:52.16
That sounded good.

1594
01:08:52.16 --> 01:08:53.16
That sounded cool.

1595
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:54.16
But in there.

1596
01:08:54.16 --> 01:08:55.16
I don't.

1597
01:08:55.16 --> 01:08:57.16
I don't listen to it because I'm saying.

1598
01:08:57.16 --> 01:08:58.16
Yeah.

1599
01:08:58.16 --> 01:08:59.16
I thought it sounded dope.

1600
01:08:59.16 --> 01:09:00.16
Okay.

1601
01:09:00.16 --> 01:09:03.16
But it's it's absolutely true.

1602
01:09:03.16 --> 01:09:07.16
And you know, and there's little micro struggles, you know, in life.

1603
01:09:07.16 --> 01:09:08.16
It's face it.

1604
01:09:08.16 --> 01:09:09.16
I know you have some mic.

1605
01:09:09.16 --> 01:09:10.16
I was a lot on the other way.

1606
01:09:10.16 --> 01:09:12.16
Oh, my struggles are mic.

1607
01:09:12.16 --> 01:09:13.16
You know.

1608
01:09:13.16 --> 01:09:14.16
It's seemingly.

1609
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:15.16
But guess what?

1610
01:09:15.16 --> 01:09:16.16
No problem.

1611
01:09:16.16 --> 01:09:17.16
You know.

1612
01:09:17.16 --> 01:09:18.16
No factor.

1613
01:09:18.16 --> 01:09:19.16
No factor.

1614
01:09:19.16 --> 01:09:21.16
I was filling up.

1615
01:09:21.16 --> 01:09:22.16
Jugs.

1616
01:09:22.16 --> 01:09:23.16
And I use this example.

1617
01:09:23.16 --> 01:09:24.16
I'm going to do it again.

1618
01:09:24.16 --> 01:09:25.16
You know why?

1619
01:09:25.16 --> 01:09:26.16
Because it's it every time I fill up jugs.

1620
01:09:26.16 --> 01:09:27.16
I think about this.

1621
01:09:27.16 --> 01:09:29.16
The struggle is real water.

1622
01:09:29.16 --> 01:09:30.16
Jugs.

1623
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:32.16
They're like, well, 40 pounds right.

1624
01:09:32.16 --> 01:09:33.16
I think like seven pounds.

1625
01:09:33.16 --> 01:09:34.16
How many gallons are there?

1626
01:09:34.16 --> 01:09:35.16
I think it's eight pounds per gallon.

1627
01:09:35.16 --> 01:09:36.16
Seven.

1628
01:09:36.16 --> 01:09:37.16
Seven.

1629
01:09:37.16 --> 01:09:38.16
Okay.

1630
01:09:38.16 --> 01:09:39.16
So they're five gallons each.

1631
01:09:39.16 --> 01:09:40.16
Yeah.

1632
01:09:40.16 --> 01:09:41.16
Okay.

1633
01:09:41.16 --> 01:09:43.16
So that's, you know, but no problem.

1634
01:09:43.16 --> 01:09:44.16
You know, like you can do it.

1635
01:09:44.16 --> 01:09:45.16
No.

1636
01:09:45.16 --> 01:09:46.16
I don't need a cart to carry him.

1637
01:09:46.16 --> 01:09:47.16
You know, kind of thing.

1638
01:09:47.16 --> 01:09:48.16
What do you carry?

1639
01:09:48.16 --> 01:09:49.16
Just want to need your own.

1640
01:09:49.16 --> 01:09:50.16
Yeah.

1641
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:51.16
Want to need your own.

1642
01:09:51.16 --> 01:09:53.16
You would say, you want to say, no, see how you're like, that's nothing.

1643
01:09:53.16 --> 01:09:54.16
Yeah.

1644
01:09:54.16 --> 01:09:55.16
That's nothing.

1645
01:09:55.16 --> 01:09:57.16
But for a lot of people who don't work out or nothing.

1646
01:09:57.16 --> 01:09:58.16
That's nothing.

1647
01:09:58.16 --> 01:09:59.16
It's something.

1648
01:09:59.16 --> 01:10:01.16
All right.

1649
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:04.16
Nonetheless, I'm just saying, like, if you're prepared.

1650
01:10:04.16 --> 01:10:05.16
Okay.

1651
01:10:05.16 --> 01:10:07.16
So tell us how we can have a pair of drugs.

1652
01:10:07.16 --> 01:10:08.16
Yeah.

1653
01:10:08.16 --> 01:10:09.16
Okay.

1654
01:10:09.16 --> 01:10:12.16
So first thing you do is maintain.

1655
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:16.16
Maintain your, your, what do you call it?

1656
01:10:16.16 --> 01:10:18.16
Your, your structure.

1657
01:10:18.16 --> 01:10:21.16
Foundational structure.

1658
01:10:21.16 --> 01:10:23.16
Make sure you're not breaking down.

1659
01:10:23.16 --> 01:10:24.16
Starting with your joints.

1660
01:10:24.16 --> 01:10:25.16
As always, say,

1661
01:10:25.16 --> 01:10:27.16
Chocoism supplements.

1662
01:10:27.16 --> 01:10:29.16
Crill oil and

1663
01:10:29.16 --> 01:10:31.16
Glucose meaning contractants supplements.

1664
01:10:31.16 --> 01:10:33.16
Choco super crill.

1665
01:10:33.16 --> 01:10:35.16
Crill oil.

1666
01:10:35.16 --> 01:10:39.16
And what's called joint warfare?

1667
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:41.16
Choco joint warfare.

1668
01:10:41.16 --> 01:10:44.16
That's Glucose meaning conjoined and some other good stuff for your joints.

1669
01:10:44.16 --> 01:10:45.16
It's funny.

1670
01:10:45.16 --> 01:10:47.16
Other stuff is actually.

1671
01:10:47.16 --> 01:10:49.16
Really beneficial.

1672
01:10:49.16 --> 01:10:52.16
So go to origin main.com and read.

1673
01:10:52.16 --> 01:10:57.16
So that you can realize the benefits that you're getting because it's good for you.

1674
01:10:57.16 --> 01:10:58.16
Yeah.

1675
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:00.16
And I'll go beyond just good for you.

1676
01:11:00.16 --> 01:11:03.16
It's the kind where, and I'm saying this first hand.

1677
01:11:03.16 --> 01:11:05.16
First hand account.

1678
01:11:05.16 --> 01:11:06.16
My, okay.

1679
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:10.16
Before you take this, you're going to have joint pain.

1680
01:11:10.16 --> 01:11:13.16
And even this non-factor joint pain.

1681
01:11:13.16 --> 01:11:14.16
That's how it did.

1682
01:11:14.16 --> 01:11:15.16
Worked the other day.

1683
01:11:15.16 --> 01:11:16.16
Dave Brooks popular today.

1684
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:17.16
Yeah.

1685
01:11:17.16 --> 01:11:18.16
Yeah.

1686
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:22.16
So Dave Burke asked me about Crill oil.

1687
01:11:22.16 --> 01:11:23.16
Just in general.

1688
01:11:23.16 --> 01:11:25.16
You're like, well, I don't have joint pain.

1689
01:11:25.16 --> 01:11:27.16
Like most of the workouts I do.

1690
01:11:27.16 --> 01:11:28.16
See, and that's the thing.

1691
01:11:28.16 --> 01:11:31.16
So I was kind of like that too, where I didn't know.

1692
01:11:31.16 --> 01:11:35.16
And I don't want to be the guy who's like, no, you do have this problem.

1693
01:11:35.16 --> 01:11:36.16
And they're like, bro, I don't have this problem.

1694
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:37.16
No, no, no, you do.

1695
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:38.16
And you need this product.

1696
01:11:38.16 --> 01:11:41.16
You know, I'm not, I didn't want to be that guy.

1697
01:11:41.16 --> 01:11:42.16
I didn't want to come off like that guy.

1698
01:11:42.16 --> 01:11:44.16
So I'm like, yeah.

1699
01:11:44.16 --> 01:11:47.16
You'll save coming off like that for the podcast.

1700
01:11:47.16 --> 01:11:50.16
No, he made a good point.

1701
01:11:50.16 --> 01:12:00.16
If you don't have like joint pain or whatever, then yeah, you won't have the exact experience I did because I did have joint pain.

1702
01:12:00.16 --> 01:12:04.16
And I joined pain in places that I didn't kind of realize it.

1703
01:12:04.16 --> 01:12:07.16
You just feel like, oh, don't dang, I'm like, I think that's just better.

1704
01:12:07.16 --> 01:12:08.16
That's your baseline.

1705
01:12:08.16 --> 01:12:09.16
You get used to the pain.

1706
01:12:09.16 --> 01:12:12.16
On top of the fact that I had pain that I didn't, that I knew wasn't normal.

1707
01:12:12.16 --> 01:12:16.16
You know, just more stiff now that I'm getting older, whatever, but nonetheless, I was like,

1708
01:12:16.16 --> 01:12:17.16
You're looking old.

1709
01:12:17.16 --> 01:12:21.16
I think, bro, how do I look?

1710
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:25.16
You know, I've burned it in two days by the way.

1711
01:12:25.16 --> 01:12:26.16
Okay.

1712
01:12:26.16 --> 01:12:39.16
Anyway, sure, you could not have joint pain, but even before I had like any kind of pain from working out or whatever from joint or in my joints or whatever,

1713
01:12:39.16 --> 01:12:42.16
I should have started taking it before that.

1714
01:12:42.16 --> 01:12:43.16
I should have.

1715
01:12:43.16 --> 01:12:45.16
And I'm not saying people take it or what?

1716
01:12:45.16 --> 01:12:47.16
I'm not saying that necessarily.

1717
01:12:47.16 --> 01:12:51.16
So Dave's question to me was, should I start taking it?

1718
01:12:51.16 --> 01:12:52.16
I said yes.

1719
01:12:52.16 --> 01:12:54.16
Yeah, 100% it's good advice.

1720
01:12:54.16 --> 01:12:56.16
But I did have to let him know.

1721
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:03.16
If you legitimately or not have joint pain, don't think that it's going to be a miracle thing like it felt like for me.

1722
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:06.16
That's the point.

1723
01:13:06.16 --> 01:13:10.16
Nonetheless, it's the best stuff because it's from jockel, right?

1724
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:14.16
Yeah, well, it's the best stuff because it's the best stuff.

1725
01:13:14.16 --> 01:13:16.16
It happens to be happens to be anyway.

1726
01:13:16.16 --> 01:13:23.16
Go to originmain.com for this super-crile oil and jockel joint warfare on the tops of his labs.

1727
01:13:23.16 --> 01:13:24.16
I always see that.

1728
01:13:24.16 --> 01:13:25.16
It's on the front too.

1729
01:13:25.16 --> 01:13:25.16
Yeah.

1730
01:13:25.16 --> 01:13:26.16
It's real obvious, just go there.

1731
01:13:26.16 --> 01:13:27.16
Originmain.com.

1732
01:13:27.16 --> 01:13:28.16
There's also some keys.

1733
01:13:28.16 --> 01:13:34.16
If you're still wondering about what gear to get, don't wonder anymore.

1734
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:35.16
Straight up.

1735
01:13:35.16 --> 01:13:35.16
Yeah.

1736
01:13:35.16 --> 01:13:39.16
And there's actually no comparison.

1737
01:13:39.16 --> 01:13:39.16
Yeah.

1738
01:13:39.16 --> 01:13:40.16
You're quite honest with you.

1739
01:13:40.16 --> 01:13:41.16
There's no comparison.

1740
01:13:41.16 --> 01:13:51.16
Every other gear is not made here in America with American hands American material.

1741
01:13:51.16 --> 01:13:52.16
Yeah.

1742
01:13:52.16 --> 01:13:53.16
So there's no comparison.

1743
01:13:53.16 --> 01:13:54.16
You can't compare.

1744
01:13:54.16 --> 01:13:55.16
Yeah.

1745
01:13:55.16 --> 01:13:56.16
You literally can't compare.

1746
01:13:56.16 --> 01:13:57.16
Yeah.

1747
01:13:57.16 --> 01:14:01.16
And I don't want to turn this into like, you know,

1748
01:14:01.16 --> 01:14:04.16
putting down any other gear company.

1749
01:14:04.16 --> 01:14:06.16
So I'm not necessarily going to do that.

1750
01:14:06.16 --> 01:14:14.16
But let's face it in certain manufacturing industries.

1751
01:14:14.16 --> 01:14:23.16
I guess brands, a lot of brands, they all go to the same supplier in Pakistan.

1752
01:14:23.16 --> 01:14:24.16
Yeah.

1753
01:14:24.16 --> 01:14:26.16
They all come from the same place.

1754
01:14:26.16 --> 01:14:27.16
Yeah.

1755
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:29.16
And that's why I said there's actually no comparison.

1756
01:14:29.16 --> 01:14:30.16
Yeah.

1757
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:31.16
And it's not just no comparison.

1758
01:14:31.16 --> 01:14:34.16
It's no comparison because it's been designed.

1759
01:14:34.16 --> 01:14:35.16
Yeah.

1760
01:14:35.16 --> 01:14:39.16
From the ground up by people that do jujitsu.

1761
01:14:39.16 --> 01:14:39.16
Yes.

1762
01:14:39.16 --> 01:14:44.16
By people that do jujitsu on the daily at origin, factory,

1763
01:14:44.16 --> 01:14:46.16
the, you know what the next building is?

1764
01:14:46.16 --> 01:14:48.16
The origin training facility.

1765
01:14:48.16 --> 01:14:49.16
So it's like, yeah.

1766
01:14:49.16 --> 01:14:51.16
It's like we're going to put on our geese and train.

1767
01:14:51.16 --> 01:14:53.16
And then we're going to make sure that it's square and away.

1768
01:14:53.16 --> 01:14:54.16
Yeah.

1769
01:14:54.16 --> 01:14:55.16
From the material.

1770
01:14:55.16 --> 01:14:56.16
By the way, it's not like, oh,

1771
01:14:56.16 --> 01:14:59.16
what we wanted to look like this and we'll just have to use some random material.

1772
01:14:59.16 --> 01:15:00.16
Yeah.

1773
01:15:00.16 --> 01:15:05.16
We'll design the material, design the weave of the material.

1774
01:15:05.16 --> 01:15:05.16
Yes.

1775
01:15:05.16 --> 01:15:08.16
And so that it's optimum for jujitsu.

1776
01:15:08.16 --> 01:15:10.16
And that's what we'll make and sell.

1777
01:15:10.16 --> 01:15:11.16
So there's no comparison.

1778
01:15:11.16 --> 01:15:12.16
Yeah.

1779
01:15:12.16 --> 01:15:15.16
And he was like, you know what else to do and anything close to that.

1780
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:16.16
Yeah.

1781
01:15:16.16 --> 01:15:19.16
The closest would be, hey, we're making it look.

1782
01:15:19.16 --> 01:15:22.16
We're putting a color to it or putting a patch somewhere.

1783
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:25.16
Or, you know, that's the closest you could do to say,

1784
01:15:25.16 --> 01:15:26.16
and we're doing something like this.

1785
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:27.16
Yeah.

1786
01:15:27.16 --> 01:15:29.16
No one is designing from the ground up.

1787
01:15:29.16 --> 01:15:30.16
Yeah.

1788
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:33.16
From the material up from the threads themselves.

1789
01:15:33.16 --> 01:15:34.16
Yeah.

1790
01:15:34.16 --> 01:15:35.16
The typical scenario.

1791
01:15:35.16 --> 01:15:36.16
And by the way, it's not just the geese.

1792
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:37.16
The rashguards.

1793
01:15:37.16 --> 01:15:38.16
Same thing.

1794
01:15:38.16 --> 01:15:39.16
Yeah.

1795
01:15:39.16 --> 01:15:43.16
The material created by origin.

1796
01:15:43.16 --> 01:15:44.16
Yeah.

1797
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:45.16
Yeah.

1798
01:15:45.16 --> 01:15:49.16
The typical scenarios you get, you know, hey, I'm going to be surprised.

1799
01:15:49.16 --> 01:15:52.16
Even these like kind of established geobrans.

1800
01:15:52.16 --> 01:15:55.16
Like, so it doesn't matter which ones or whatever,

1801
01:15:55.16 --> 01:15:58.16
but they'll be like, hey, yeah, let's do, you know, let's make this ghee.

1802
01:15:58.16 --> 01:16:01.16
Oh, by the way, let's get the same blanks that we used.

1803
01:16:01.16 --> 01:16:04.16
That we've always been getting in that everyone else.

1804
01:16:04.16 --> 01:16:09.16
And let's just put a cool stitch on there or something or patch or design.

1805
01:16:09.16 --> 01:16:11.16
That's just the way it typically works.

1806
01:16:11.16 --> 01:16:13.16
Not even necessarily that there's anything wrong with it.

1807
01:16:13.16 --> 01:16:15.16
Because if you like you'd like your ghee, that's good.

1808
01:16:15.16 --> 01:16:16.16
That's how I am.

1809
01:16:16.16 --> 01:16:19.16
But yeah, the origin once you kind of put it on,

1810
01:16:19.16 --> 01:16:24.16
I will argue that you're going to kind of understand my opinion.

1811
01:16:24.16 --> 01:16:26.16
On the last origin main.com.

1812
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:28.16
That's the good one.

1813
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:32.16
Also for legit fitness gear.

1814
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:35.16
Go to onit.com slash jockel.

1815
01:16:35.16 --> 01:16:36.16
Good kettle bells on there.

1816
01:16:36.16 --> 01:16:39.16
They got some Star Wars kettle bells.

1817
01:16:39.16 --> 01:16:41.16
That's cool.

1818
01:16:41.16 --> 01:16:43.16
Yeah, see, that's the thing then.

1819
01:16:43.16 --> 01:16:46.16
You don't really care that much about these cool kettle bells.

1820
01:16:46.16 --> 01:16:47.16
I do.

1821
01:16:47.16 --> 01:16:48.16
I do.

1822
01:16:48.16 --> 01:16:49.16
I think they're dope.

1823
01:16:49.16 --> 01:16:52.16
Nonetheless, yeah, kettle bells on there.

1824
01:16:52.16 --> 01:16:54.16
I got into kettle bells a while ago.

1825
01:16:54.16 --> 01:16:57.16
Very glad I had wished I had done it earlier.

1826
01:16:57.16 --> 01:16:59.16
Did I get you into kettle bells?

1827
01:16:59.16 --> 01:17:00.16
Yeah.

1828
01:17:00.16 --> 01:17:02.16
I got you into Kerala oil and kettle bells.

1829
01:17:02.16 --> 01:17:03.16
Yeah.

1830
01:17:03.16 --> 01:17:04.16
I thought I'd do it up.

1831
01:17:04.16 --> 01:17:08.16
But both, yeah, both not necessarily not actively.

1832
01:17:08.16 --> 01:17:10.16
And I got you in the Maccons too.

1833
01:17:10.16 --> 01:17:11.16
Maccons.

1834
01:17:11.16 --> 01:17:12.16
Yeah, you used to not do Maccons.

1835
01:17:12.16 --> 01:17:14.16
I remember you sent me a text sometimes like,

1836
01:17:14.16 --> 01:17:18.16
it was like, what's the deal with this, this metabolic conditioning?

1837
01:17:18.16 --> 01:17:19.16
Yeah.

1838
01:17:19.16 --> 01:17:20.16
You see what should I do?

1839
01:17:20.16 --> 01:17:23.16
I just sent you in the albums and you started doing Maccons.

1840
01:17:23.16 --> 01:17:26.16
And your cardio on the Mac got a lot better.

1841
01:17:26.16 --> 01:17:27.16
Yeah.

1842
01:17:27.16 --> 01:17:28.16
Yeah.

1843
01:17:28.16 --> 01:17:29.16
Quick, too, by the way.

1844
01:17:29.16 --> 01:17:30.16
Yeah.

1845
01:17:30.16 --> 01:17:31.16
Maccons.

1846
01:17:31.16 --> 01:17:33.16
Maccons with kettle bells and krill oil.

1847
01:17:33.16 --> 01:17:35.16
That's the combo right there.

1848
01:17:35.16 --> 01:17:38.16
Anyway, and there's a lot of cool other exercise stuff on there.

1849
01:17:38.16 --> 01:17:40.16
Like, create more creative stuff.

1850
01:17:40.16 --> 01:17:43.16
You know, keep your workouts interesting.

1851
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:44.16
That is on it.

1852
01:17:44.16 --> 01:17:46.16
Doc Hans, last chocolate check out some stuff on there.

1853
01:17:46.16 --> 01:17:47.16
They got some really good stuff.

1854
01:17:47.16 --> 01:17:48.16
Really good stuff.

1855
01:17:48.16 --> 01:17:52.16
Audrey's smart with that, where he's always like pushing like the good stuff.

1856
01:17:52.16 --> 01:17:55.16
You know, you know, also,

1857
01:17:55.16 --> 01:17:56.16
chocolate is a store.

1858
01:17:56.16 --> 01:17:58.16
It's called JockelStore.

1859
01:17:58.16 --> 01:17:59.16
JockelStore.com.

1860
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:03.16
It has, if you want to get these shirts that we make,

1861
01:18:03.16 --> 01:18:05.16
that we happen to make.

1862
01:18:05.16 --> 01:18:06.16
They're good shirts, dude.

1863
01:18:06.16 --> 01:18:08.16
They're not like free shirts.

1864
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:11.16
You know, the free ones that you need like cool.

1865
01:18:11.16 --> 01:18:12.16
And you never wear it.

1866
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:13.16
It's not that kind of very wearable.

1867
01:18:13.16 --> 01:18:15.16
I made it a point to make them like good.

1868
01:18:15.16 --> 01:18:17.16
You know, some one's stuff on there.

1869
01:18:17.16 --> 01:18:21.16
Rashgards, patches, hoodies.

1870
01:18:21.16 --> 01:18:23.16
You know, it's a can cold or no.

1871
01:18:23.16 --> 01:18:25.16
Places.

1872
01:18:25.16 --> 01:18:27.16
No, I'm not a thicker hoodies.

1873
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:29.16
Does it call them a Kawaii right now?

1874
01:18:29.16 --> 01:18:30.16
It is.

1875
01:18:30.16 --> 01:18:31.16
Actually, it is.

1876
01:18:31.16 --> 01:18:33.16
It's like 60.

1877
01:18:33.16 --> 01:18:34.16
There's one on top of Kawaii right?

1878
01:18:34.16 --> 01:18:35.16
No, not quite.

1879
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:36.16
It's a big island.

1880
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:37.16
Yeah.

1881
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:38.16
Dang it.

1882
01:18:38.16 --> 01:18:39.16
I'm on a kid.

1883
01:18:39.16 --> 01:18:42.16
I just revealed my, not everyone knows.

1884
01:18:42.16 --> 01:18:43.16
Non, Hawaii.

1885
01:18:43.16 --> 01:18:44.16
That's all right.

1886
01:18:44.16 --> 01:18:45.16
You're coming.

1887
01:18:45.16 --> 01:18:46.16
I'm not to me.

1888
01:18:46.16 --> 01:18:49.16
I might have to suspend your my colleague card for a little while.

1889
01:18:49.16 --> 01:18:50.16
I'll have to now.

1890
01:18:50.16 --> 01:18:51.16
I'm not.

1891
01:18:51.16 --> 01:18:56.16
Anyway, we got some goodies for people who are in places other than Hawaii.

1892
01:18:56.16 --> 01:18:59.16
Or if you're on Monikaia.

1893
01:18:59.16 --> 01:19:00.16
Thick or hoodies.

1894
01:19:00.16 --> 01:19:01.16
All this stuff.

1895
01:19:01.16 --> 01:19:02.16
Anyway, I'm not saying buy stuff.

1896
01:19:02.16 --> 01:19:03.16
I'm saying go on there.

1897
01:19:03.16 --> 01:19:04.16
Check it out.

1898
01:19:04.16 --> 01:19:05.16
If you like something, get something.

1899
01:19:05.16 --> 01:19:06.16
It's a good way to support.

1900
01:19:06.16 --> 01:19:08.16
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

1901
01:19:08.16 --> 01:19:10.16
If you haven't already on iTunes and Stitcher and Google play.

1902
01:19:10.16 --> 01:19:12.16
Wow, whatever you listen to the podcast.

1903
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:13.16
You subscribe.

1904
01:19:13.16 --> 01:19:14.16
Seems obvious.

1905
01:19:14.16 --> 01:19:15.16
I know.

1906
01:19:15.16 --> 01:19:17.16
If you haven't subscribed, good way to support.

1907
01:19:17.16 --> 01:19:18.16
Also on YouTube.

1908
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:19.16
We have YouTube channel.

1909
01:19:19.16 --> 01:19:25.16
There is various reasons to subscribe to YouTube.

1910
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:27.16
But the main one, I think.

1911
01:19:27.16 --> 01:19:30.16
Main two is if you like the video version of this podcast.

1912
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:34.16
And you like little excerpts.

1913
01:19:34.16 --> 01:19:37.16
Whether we put some music behind them.

1914
01:19:37.16 --> 01:19:39.16
I want to say we, I mean me.

1915
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:43.16
Put some music behind them and some various effects.

1916
01:19:43.16 --> 01:19:48.16
Or not, there is excerpts, you know, little shorter than the whole version of the podcast.

1917
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:49.16
And you can share them.

1918
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:51.16
Listen to them or whatever.

1919
01:19:51.16 --> 01:19:52.16
Let quick or anyway.

1920
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:54.16
Subscribe to YouTube as well.

1921
01:19:54.16 --> 01:19:55.16
I'm saying if you want.

1922
01:19:55.16 --> 01:19:58.16
And if you do want to, and you do, it's a good way to support.

1923
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:00.16
Also, psychological warfare.

1924
01:20:00.16 --> 01:20:09.16
If you know what that is, it's an album on iTunes that you can get with tracks.

1925
01:20:09.16 --> 01:20:13.16
And you can get that on your campaign against weakness on the path.

1926
01:20:13.16 --> 01:20:15.16
Trying to get in better shape.

1927
01:20:15.16 --> 01:20:17.16
You're trying to get in shape.

1928
01:20:17.16 --> 01:20:19.16
You want to maintain your shape.

1929
01:20:19.16 --> 01:20:20.16
You want to.

1930
01:20:20.16 --> 01:20:22.16
What wake up early.

1931
01:20:22.16 --> 01:20:23.16
I think you covered it.

1932
01:20:23.16 --> 01:20:24.16
No, no, no, no.

1933
01:20:24.16 --> 01:20:27.16
These are the I'm saying you know, but here's the thing.

1934
01:20:27.16 --> 01:20:29.16
It's like, it's because it's okay.

1935
01:20:29.16 --> 01:20:32.16
So it seems obvious, right?

1936
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:33.16
You're trying to get in shape.

1937
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:34.16
You're going to have hard days.

1938
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:36.16
You know, days where you're like, I'm going to skip the workout.

1939
01:20:36.16 --> 01:20:37.16
Right?

1940
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:38.16
No.

1941
01:20:38.16 --> 01:20:39.16
It seems obvious.

1942
01:20:39.16 --> 01:20:43.16
That's an element of life on the path that seems obvious.

1943
01:20:43.16 --> 01:20:46.16
You'll run into like points of weakness.

1944
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:47.16
It's obvious.

1945
01:20:47.16 --> 01:20:48.16
And I dig it.

1946
01:20:48.16 --> 01:20:49.16
And there's a track for that.

1947
01:20:49.16 --> 01:20:50.16
Jocquitose you why you shouldn't do that.

1948
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:51.16
You just listen to it.

1949
01:20:51.16 --> 01:20:52.16
Boom.

1950
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:53.16
Get right back on track.

1951
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:56.16
But I don't always do what I don't always talk about.

1952
01:20:56.16 --> 01:20:58.16
Is that there's tracks for other things?

1953
01:20:58.16 --> 01:21:00.16
Like the creativity thing.

1954
01:21:00.16 --> 01:21:04.16
Like if you got like a procrastination situation.

1955
01:21:04.16 --> 01:21:05.16
How's Alan?

1956
01:21:05.16 --> 01:21:09.16
You're like, the reason you're looking at me like this is because you already know this,

1957
01:21:09.16 --> 01:21:11.16
but not everybody knows this.

1958
01:21:11.16 --> 01:21:14.16
You're procrastinating me finishing this podcast.

1959
01:21:14.16 --> 01:21:15.16
No, I don't know.

1960
01:21:15.16 --> 01:21:21.16
We are finishing this podcast strong with both loads of value.

1961
01:21:21.16 --> 01:21:22.16
Because I'm late.

1962
01:21:22.16 --> 01:21:23.16
I'm late.

1963
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:24.16
People know.

1964
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:25.16
This is what you did.

1965
01:21:25.16 --> 01:21:26.16
You say psychological warfare.

1966
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:34.16
It's an album with tracks on iTunes, MP3, Google Play, Amazon music.

1967
01:21:34.16 --> 01:21:38.16
If you're going to run into some issues, it'll help you out getting through those issues.

1968
01:21:38.16 --> 01:21:39.16
Next topic.

1969
01:21:39.16 --> 01:21:40.16
Yeah.

1970
01:21:40.16 --> 01:21:43.16
I guess I could have said it like that.

1971
01:21:43.16 --> 01:21:46.16
That's more of like the jocquit way to say it.

1972
01:21:46.16 --> 01:21:51.16
You know, like I don't, I feel like if I come from the place of, you know,

1973
01:21:51.16 --> 01:22:01.16
authentic relation to this struggle, I feel like it'll, it'll, it'll pass the message in a more accurate way.

1974
01:22:01.16 --> 01:22:02.16
I think.

1975
01:22:02.16 --> 01:22:04.16
Okay.

1976
01:22:04.16 --> 01:22:06.16
You don't skip workouts.

1977
01:22:06.16 --> 01:22:07.16
True.

1978
01:22:07.16 --> 01:22:09.16
You, do you, okay, here's this.

1979
01:22:09.16 --> 01:22:10.16
How's this?

1980
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:14.16
Do you ever sit in your gym?

1981
01:22:14.16 --> 01:22:17.16
Sit on the bench or whatever?

1982
01:22:17.16 --> 01:22:21.16
Or the bike and be like, man, if I, and make deals with your stuff,

1983
01:22:21.16 --> 01:22:24.16
hey, if I skip today, I'll just do it double.

1984
01:22:24.16 --> 01:22:27.16
I'll tell you what I'll do is like if I'm doing something that's going to suck.

1985
01:22:27.16 --> 01:22:29.16
Like, it squats.

1986
01:22:29.16 --> 01:22:30.16
Yeah.

1987
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:34.16
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll procrastinate.

1988
01:22:34.16 --> 01:22:36.16
I'm in the gym. Like it's gonna happen.

1989
01:22:36.16 --> 01:22:37.16
Okay.

1990
01:22:37.16 --> 01:22:40.16
But I'll like, okay, let me just start talking about that.

1991
01:22:40.16 --> 01:22:41.16
There you go.

1992
01:22:41.16 --> 01:22:44.16
You know, but it's, it's one of those things like the outcome is known.

1993
01:22:44.16 --> 01:22:45.16
Yeah. Yeah.

1994
01:22:45.16 --> 01:22:46.16
The outcome is not in question.

1995
01:22:46.16 --> 01:22:47.16
Okay.

1996
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:48.16
The workout will happen.

1997
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:49.16
Okay.

1998
01:22:49.16 --> 01:22:52.16
I'm just being a complete baby about it.

1999
01:22:52.16 --> 01:22:53.16
Okay.

2000
01:22:53.16 --> 01:22:54.16
So then I just have to suck it up.

2001
01:22:54.16 --> 01:22:55.16
Yeah.

2002
01:22:55.16 --> 01:22:57.16
So see, that's why you're looking at me like that.

2003
01:22:57.16 --> 01:23:01.16
Because me and a lot of people like me, we're not like that.

2004
01:23:01.16 --> 01:23:03.16
We're trying to be like that.

2005
01:23:03.16 --> 01:23:04.16
We want to be like that.

2006
01:23:04.16 --> 01:23:05.16
I know I do.

2007
01:23:05.16 --> 01:23:10.16
I want to be like skipping the workout is straight up a non-not an option.

2008
01:23:10.16 --> 01:23:11.16
Ever.

2009
01:23:11.16 --> 01:23:12.16
I want to be like that.

2010
01:23:12.16 --> 01:23:13.16
I want to be like that.

2011
01:23:13.16 --> 01:23:14.16
You'll let it happen.

2012
01:23:14.16 --> 01:23:17.16
But there are times and have been times where I'm sitting there.

2013
01:23:17.16 --> 01:23:20.16
Got, but there's been times I drove to the gym before I got home.

2014
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:22.16
Dropped to the gym, sat in there.

2015
01:23:22.16 --> 01:23:26.16
It was like, that's what if I, it look, if it's block right out of here right now.

2016
01:23:26.16 --> 01:23:29.16
I skipped this workout.

2017
01:23:29.16 --> 01:23:30.16
I need to go for it.

2018
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:31.16
I need to go for it.

2019
01:23:31.16 --> 01:23:33.16
I'm not going to get a good workout anyway.

2020
01:23:33.16 --> 01:23:34.16
You know what?

2021
01:23:34.16 --> 01:23:35.16
I'll just come back in on Saturday.

2022
01:23:35.16 --> 01:23:37.16
That was my active rest.

2023
01:23:37.16 --> 01:23:39.16
I'll come back in and I'll get it then.

2024
01:23:39.16 --> 01:23:41.16
Today will be my rest day.

2025
01:23:41.16 --> 01:23:42.16
Right?

2026
01:23:42.16 --> 01:23:43.16
I'm like that.

2027
01:23:43.16 --> 01:23:44.16
Some other people are like that.

2028
01:23:44.16 --> 01:23:45.16
You're not like that.

2029
01:23:45.16 --> 01:23:46.16
That's why you don't understand.

2030
01:23:46.16 --> 01:23:47.16
No, I'm doing it.

2031
01:23:47.16 --> 01:23:47.16
No.

2032
01:23:47.16 --> 01:23:49.16
With some shuffling my papers.

2033
01:23:49.16 --> 01:23:50.16
Being passive of a girlfriend.

2034
01:23:50.16 --> 01:23:51.16
No.

2035
01:23:51.16 --> 01:23:52.16
I'm just very unlike you.

2036
01:23:52.16 --> 01:23:53.16
But, you know, hey, man.

2037
01:23:53.16 --> 01:23:54.16
So good.

2038
01:23:54.16 --> 01:23:55.16
Nonetheless.

2039
01:23:55.16 --> 01:23:55.16
Psychological warfare.

2040
01:23:55.16 --> 01:23:57.16
I'm trying to make this a point.

2041
01:23:57.16 --> 01:23:59.16
This is a for real point.

2042
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:01.16
Valueable point.

2043
01:24:01.16 --> 01:24:03.16
Is a track that Jockel.

2044
01:24:03.16 --> 01:24:04.16
Right?

2045
01:24:04.16 --> 01:24:08.16
Not even though you tried to talk me out of explaining this to you right now.

2046
01:24:08.16 --> 01:24:09.16
God.

2047
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:13.16
He will talk you out to out of effectively talk you out of skipping the work.

2048
01:24:13.16 --> 01:24:14.16
A skip in the workout.

2049
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:17.16
Talk you out of pressing the snooze or whatever.

2050
01:24:17.16 --> 01:24:19.16
All these little points of weakness on that.

2051
01:24:19.16 --> 01:24:21.16
Just if you look at them, you'll see all the little points of weakness.

2052
01:24:21.16 --> 01:24:23.16
That these tracks address.

2053
01:24:23.16 --> 01:24:24.16
It's good.

2054
01:24:24.16 --> 01:24:25.16
Very effective.

2055
01:24:25.16 --> 01:24:26.16
Cool.

2056
01:24:26.16 --> 01:24:27.16
All right.

2057
01:24:27.16 --> 01:24:28.16
We done with that section.

2058
01:24:28.16 --> 01:24:29.16
Very good.

2059
01:24:29.16 --> 01:24:31.16
We have the report podcast too.

2060
01:24:31.16 --> 01:24:32.16
All right.

2061
01:24:32.16 --> 01:24:33.16
Jockel White T.

2062
01:24:33.16 --> 01:24:34.16
You can get that on Amazon.

2063
01:24:34.16 --> 01:24:38.16
It will guaranteed 100% double blind.

2064
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:41.16
Plus CBO tested triple blind.

2065
01:24:41.16 --> 01:24:42.16
Triple blind.

2066
01:24:42.16 --> 01:24:44.16
You can deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2067
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:46.16
So you might want to pick that up on Amazon.

2068
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:47.16
You can read there.

2069
01:24:47.16 --> 01:24:49.16
If you don't believe me, that's fine.

2070
01:24:49.16 --> 01:24:50.16
Go read the.

2071
01:24:50.16 --> 01:24:55.16
The review is on Amazon where every verified purchase is like their deadlifting minimum

2072
01:24:55.16 --> 01:24:58.16
8,000 pounds books got some books.

2073
01:24:58.16 --> 01:24:59.16
Way the warrior kid.

2074
01:24:59.16 --> 01:25:04.16
If you have a kid or you know a kid, then help a kid.

2075
01:25:04.16 --> 01:25:08.16
Help them be a better person to have a better life.

2076
01:25:08.16 --> 01:25:10.16
Get them the way of the warrior kid.

2077
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:11.16
Extreme ownership.

2078
01:25:11.16 --> 01:25:17.16
The new dish is out and you all helped write it because it has questions from this podcast.

2079
01:25:17.16 --> 01:25:18.16
Also the new forward.

2080
01:25:18.16 --> 01:25:23.16
Also the color pictures lame didn't want them.

2081
01:25:23.16 --> 01:25:30.16
But made up for that by just making the cover black because black.

2082
01:25:30.16 --> 01:25:34.16
And that book has all the fundamental principles of combat leadership.

2083
01:25:34.16 --> 01:25:36.16
It's for you and your team.

2084
01:25:36.16 --> 01:25:38.16
You don't need to hide it.

2085
01:25:38.16 --> 01:25:39.16
Remembering to be getting people would want it.

2086
01:25:39.16 --> 01:25:41.16
They'd get it and they'd want to get for themselves.

2087
01:25:41.16 --> 01:25:43.16
Because they want to hide the knowledge because they want to look.

2088
01:25:43.16 --> 01:25:44.16
They want to that don't do that.

2089
01:25:44.16 --> 01:25:45.16
Doesn't help.

2090
01:25:45.16 --> 01:25:49.16
The more people know it, the more people on board, the better it's going to work.

2091
01:25:49.16 --> 01:25:54.16
Also from an individual perspective to get yourself on the path.

2092
01:25:54.16 --> 01:25:57.16
There's a book called This Pony Goes Freedom Field Manual.

2093
01:25:57.16 --> 01:26:00.16
It's available everywhere.

2094
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:05.16
And you might be wondering if it'd make a good gift.

2095
01:26:05.16 --> 01:26:08.16
Well, not only is it heavy.

2096
01:26:08.16 --> 01:26:09.16
Have you noticed how heavy it is?

2097
01:26:09.16 --> 01:26:11.16
It's a heavy book.

2098
01:26:11.16 --> 01:26:13.16
It's a big book.

2099
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:15.16
It's a substantial book.

2100
01:26:15.16 --> 01:26:23.16
It's completely unique because it has black pages and the outside of the pages are also black.

2101
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:24.16
It's a work of art.

2102
01:26:24.16 --> 01:26:25.16
For sure.

2103
01:26:25.16 --> 01:26:34.16
So get some copies for the people that you know because beyond looking really cool.

2104
01:26:34.16 --> 01:26:39.16
There is no better gift than discipline.

2105
01:26:39.16 --> 01:26:44.16
So get some copies.

2106
01:26:44.16 --> 01:26:45.16
And also if you want the audio version.

2107
01:26:45.16 --> 01:26:47.16
See now look, I'm doing the same thing you just did.

2108
01:26:47.16 --> 01:26:48.16
But let's watch how long this takes.

2109
01:26:48.16 --> 01:26:53.16
If you want the audio version of this Pony Goes Freedom Field Manual, you can get it on iTunes, Amazon,

2110
01:26:53.16 --> 01:26:57.16
Music, Google Play and other MP3 platforms.

2111

Period right there.

2112
01:26:58.16 --> 01:27:02.16
Now everyone knows what you took 15 minutes to explain.

2113
01:27:02.16 --> 01:27:08.16
If you're in further need of more fire support in terms of basic leadership.

2114
01:27:08.16 --> 01:27:13.16
Besides the podcast, besides the books.

2115
01:27:13.16 --> 01:27:17.16
And you want to have more interaction.

2116
01:27:17.16 --> 01:27:18.16
Take it to the next level.

There's enemy.

And whether that is a literal enemy.

2138
01:28:28.16 --> 01:28:32.16
Like our military personnel face or a metaphorical enemy.

2139
01:28:32.16 --> 01:28:34.16
Like people face every day.

2140
01:28:34.16 --> 01:28:37.16
Don't fear the enemy.

2141
01:28:37.16 --> 01:28:40.16
Respect the enemy.

2142
01:28:40.16 --> 01:28:43.16
And out of your respect for the enemy.

2143
01:28:43.16 --> 01:28:46.16
Prepare.

2144
01:28:46.16 --> 01:28:47.16
Prepare.

2145
01:28:47.16 --> 01:28:48.16
And train.

2146
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:49.16
And learn.

2147
01:28:49.16 --> 01:28:51.16
And stay vigilant.

2148
01:28:51.16 --> 01:28:53.16
And stay disciplined.

2149
01:28:53.16 --> 01:28:55.16
So when the enemy comes.

2150
01:28:55.16 --> 01:28:57.16
You are ready.

2151
01:28:57.16 --> 01:29:01.16
To get after it.

2152
01:29:01.16 --> 01:29:28.16
And until next time this is echo and jacco out.
