okay I wasn't thinking but you could think that again that I didn't know what in order to drink this you could just gotta get like you just gotta grit your teeth and get song potentially like hey if that happens it happens kind of like if it's not like if it's not like I don't feel that way because the reality is when supplements taste like crap you don't eat it and so we have to be cognizant of the fact that you know there's we have to consistently remember that we are all always gonna be human we're always gonna be uncomfortable change most most people like regimented schedules they like to get up a certain time like a drink certain thing eat a certain thing workout a certain time go to lunch a certain time by nature all of us hate change anyone who's in a company that goes through a big transnis for a big change you know what I'm talking about but we always have to remember that just like in the Marines we always say temper gumby the more comfortable you get being uncomfortable the happier so it's a stereotype like in at work can I thought he meant maybe like out at the club or whatever like you know need seals tend to be more into you know what's funny is you know who made a joke about this Tim Kennedy we were here we were recording the podcast Tim Kennedy was literally doing a photo shoot and he was like he's got long hair and he was like I was just thinking like it's a little much but thank you you know and that was what it was like you know who the hell I'm on to take away from there right to honor their brother and like you know who am I to do that there's just showing love all the way not halfway and so of course me being me at the time I didn't look at it that way I was just like I'm naked in front of everyone type feeling I'm just uncomfortable right now so I ended up leaving Germany and I was only there for you know what even there a full day before they send me to Bethesda and I I lent because my family was supposed to meet me a Germany but the turnaround was so fast that you know the Marines right now we're just gonna send you Bethesda and I got to Bethesda and man those flights both flights from my rack of Jeremy Germany to Bethesda every little like bit of turbulence every little bump every little movement was like being blown up all over again it was narlie because your your body was under it was in so much pain it was just I'd never puked so much because of pain in my life and it was one of those things where I was again every little jar every movement was just like yours human is the gum like there's nothing special about when you when you were in the stereotype as I moved into leadership positions and I would hear that stereotype I realized it was a real thing and that that real thing wasn't it wasn't funny it wasn't funny because when you when you eat a meta a Marine Corps battalion commander and you have long hair your uniform doesn't look right or you meet an army battalion commander or an army brigade commander or a senior or a gunney sergeant or a company first sergeant when you meet one of them somebody that's been in the Marine Corps for 23 years and you can't put on and blouse your your pants and your boots it doesn't matter how good you are in the field they're looking at you and thinking oh this guy can't even blouse boots I don't want him around that's so that stereotype even though it had definitely was rooted in truth like hey man when we got to her body everyone had shape heads everyone had square away uniforms didn't allow patches we talked about them before you know we we had guys like if we could we put a whole element in army camouflage uniform so ace use they just look like army sir but it was blown up and over to the right and second view of what affected but the guys are not too mean at this point I'm back to telling God like a man just remember our deal remember our deal and the guys are okay shit we got your bro we got you you know we got you hanged tough and how to know where I was able to take a breath and the first thing I said was developed 360 there like the door to my room opens I knew whoever was about to walk in the door like I just felt like a a spiritual presence like I just felt I knew whoever that was was a person of faith like personally got knew it knew no doubt about it felt it when the door opened the dude comes around the corner and introduce himself and it's the base chaplain and I was like okay it usually means like by this guy has no shame like he's kind of like he's he has his moral standards maybe kind of low something like that right in white no shame means don't be shy so like in South Africa when I was in South Africa they say shame and I'm facing the nurse's station when I come out in the door shuts and I just completely and utterly broke down to the point of anger like I was I was sobbing in the angry I was so angry seeing him that way and seeing and I just like just yell like those bastards like what you know what why what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing what are we gonna do about that so and on the way I can see the load master mouth to one of the other one of the other crewman we're about to fly around a tornado I read his lips and I'm like hey god like come on man throw a dude a bone like we're about I'm gonna survive all the stuff I've survived and if you let me get taken out by a tornado like we're gonna be fighting this bullshit and I went back there and started that process man and let me tell you something I consider and tell you a conviction I know why addicts they addicts because that slow withdrawal process of getting clean I mean this whole heartedly I don't know what was harder being blown up or getting clean I honestly don't know what was harder because I mean hell coming off the drugs they gave you drugs to help you come off the drugs and it's like I just you know what the frick it didn't there shot or something you can give me and I can get the hell out of here oh if we rolled out all the stereotypes for the services like marines dumb jarhead uh crayon the crayon thing that's the big marine core one what crayon crayon either yeah crayons that's like legit thing the the army's got there you know who the things and you know we don't have that kind of all that kind of thing going on uh green braise and then be willing to lower your wall and talk about the real shit you know then we have stay the course which is that's a traditional therapy that's the this is the you can't be holiday non-traditional stay the course is very traditional it's the one-on-one therapy with the warrior first owner his or her family and listen the reason that that was an attractive approach was because if you look back on what is the most successful outcome measures as far as therapy goes and as far as treating matters of the mind that has the best track record the one-on-one I think everyone on the spin and ballicator I should talk to professional way the least once a month every single person and I'm saying that is the guy that I would I would launch my piss bottle in the hospital that wanted to come in my room now I'm telling you right now I wish I had started that a long time ago because it would have saved me from a lot of shit I've had to do with because I let my pride win that's it I mean don't be afraid to say what it is we started a thing called the Brave Program which is women's specific because believe it or not neither sex knows everything that just don't there's power numbers but women when you break it down you break the numbers down to the bare bones they're leading the charge and everything in a negative light and that's I think it has a lot to do with there a much smaller population when it comes to the service community so there are more apt to be ice to do one self-medication isolation you know and then and they don't have nearly as big as a immediate tribe to depend on as we do because they're just way less of them and so that's that's our Brave Program and they can go do all the things that all the guys do and I called Flipper one in Flipper two and that's when I was kind of introduced to the nonprofit world and working with warriors and their families and first responders and law enforcement officers and their families you know it was like they clicked with me like I like I like this so you so you go through the two and a half months and you get clean what's the temptation like once you're clean are you are you feeling like I mean is it always there what is it for a while bro for a while it's all day every day every time I leave my room or I have to talk to someone rather I'm related to him or not or got for a bit I have to go to like the mall or some shit all I thought about for a while was man this would be so much easier if I was I right now all the time so I thought about for a while what about and I was like I don't want to experience what I'm about to have to experience I'd rather take the cowards way out so I was like I'm sure I could like I'm I'm passed out when he walks in I'm on a lot of drugs that'll work so I hear not call the door I'm like here the door open so they load their they're rolling me on the gurney and this young sailors pushing me and I remember every little like in the grout that separates tiles like every little bump it was like getting blown up again and it would just make it would take my pan from six to as much as you could think snap of a family and it was gnarly and so I remember he's going to push me on the elevator to take me down at ICU and you know the big gap the separates the floor and the elevator we goes across that He's like, you know, it's like he fell off a poster, and there he was, you know, like three red stripe, make Matt black belt, and just, I mean, drill master, all of you name it, and he did it. yeah man they sent me a stop thing today that's why i know this stuff get it for your business life and also you can right now order the follow on book two extreme ownership that are wrote with my brother life babbin it's called the dichotomy of leadership it is finding the balance as a leader and i talk about this all the time on the podcast i actually said i actually talked about this in the first public interview i ever did with Tim Ferriss he asked me about the qualities of leaders i said balance so well that's what i'm talking about as we continue to work with companies and businesses people like the hardest thing people have hardest challenge people have is balance i talked to talk about that with the talking about chesty polar so much balance he balanced perfectly be between being hard and being gentle he found that perfect balance because you know if you're gentle two gentles a leader you're a pushover known respect you two hard as a leader you drive people too hard you're slave driver no one likes your no one respects you you gotta find that balance that's what this book is about and if you need qrf at your company quick reaction force right if you need some support some help with your leadership well contact the quick reaction force for your team it's called national on front it's

room lake same way jp same way dav same way echo Charles same same way you come to you anyone of those if you want to they're fun I don't imagine being on the drill field as long as he was the help and he said we're doing our hanging in there first son he said it could go could go hey you want to have him in with my brother my dad was like sure you know go ahead first order like he was gonna turn around come talk to me there by in the room he looks right at my father and says like okay these are some serious things where for six months to a year like I didn't know if I was gonna keep my left leg on my left arm because they they were I was going through all these operations to save these two appendages that were and for all its purposes I was a guinea pig for a lot of stuff which I'm okay with was better me than my brothers I'm alright with that small price to pay would be one of the world's finest right and they're like hey man we gotta do something this is you know this is this is our family no one even knows this is a thing with the hell are we doing and at the time I'm working at a place that focuses completely on the brain I'm surrounded by neuroscience this PhD's MD's and I'm learning a lot of things that just reiterated the fact that post-managed stress, rag, brain injury these are very, very real things and I worked there for three years while 22 kills started and it basically started as an awareness movement and that's where the push-up challenge was born the 22 push-up challenge I was started by 22 kills in 2012 this was this and that went viral in 2016 so you know overnight success is not a real thing and it's like, hey, I'm how pretty sure he's like, oh, well, I couldn't, I didn't do anything like, and I'm like, hey, first of all, there is no Richter skill on painted suffering. and I can't do that to the tribe on top of that there's I can't I need to get my shift together and it's gonna be ugly and it's gonna be sloppy and it's not gonna be it's gonna be the antithesis of what it should look like but I owe that to them I owe that to him that is when I decided that you know what I'm gonna I'm going to try really hard to do this life thing the way that I'm supposed to do it you know it was like if that's the way Murphy works dude not a fan not a fan of of that Murphy and so you know wake up and I'm like all right got a wake up team okay well when I walk off a stage the first time I walk off a stage and I feel like I didn't leave a piece of my soul there that's the last time I'll do it because again it's mutually beneficial and if it's not then in your presenter you're only gonna fake it for so long people don't really that's like I feel like I ran a marathon when I'm done presenting for an hour I'm mentally physically and emotionally exhausted and if you're not you're faking it it's getting out they know like one you know that happens to be number one number one kids podcast kids and family podcast so that's cool all right speaking of way the warrior kid there's the book way of the warrior kid and there's also the new book boom there it is hardcover way the warrior kid to marks mission uncle jake continues to help mark with some of his problems losing his temper how to handle being made fun of don't you wish somebody told you how to handle being made fun of yeah your kid and it just starts playing the video no advertisement here's the thing I don't mind the advertisements that's how I find out about like a bunch of the new music come out a lot of like um like you know intermittent and she's like you're gonna have to come back to BAM see we're gonna have to ween you off the drugs which is not what I wanted to hear because it was like when I left him so you're already saying he had to go on like no need to ever come back here done but just with us we so we have programs like Camp Baha'ala which is a program where we can we take up words first responders law force and officers the most in the early side of it is we're taking them up in the helicopter and taking them to kill hogs out of helicopter like as if you don't like that then you don't like freedom I'm dead say you're getting your first one hurry at first horse walks in so I'm like I gotta pass out as soon as you bust the hatch and walks in my freaking heart monitor dime is me out because it goes from like the slow steady beep to the the rapid beep and I'm like I'm up there obviously this isn't gonna work and there is no plan to be I'm awake and he looks at my family I'm in my dad's in there my mom my step mom my aunt my cousins my brother my sister and and it's it's a humbling experience to do it as well because being in the shadow of people like these guys people like yourself it's it's a humbling experience to be around warriors like that from all phases of history and we're gonna keep doing it and when you get that program rolling get your ass back on here we'll talk about it we'll talk about how it's going okay that's might not might not keep the left arm and I looked down at my left leg which was turned outward like if you're sitting down with both legs like you're gonna touch your toes my left leg was turned outward to the left and my foot was inverted like with my toes pointing at me and my boot was blown off but It was like a, I don't know if he's like a Lance Koolie and then there's like a staff sergeant and they had driver seat and I'm up on the turret, right? and I was like no this is like a three weeks supply and um man I started that's how I integrated I'm back into civilian society was high as a kite knowing that if I don't have to fill and I can do go through this thing numb nothing matters because if you can't fill it who cares you know I mean who cares and it was something that really was um it just got worse and worse I mean essentially what I did for a year and a half was chase my first high And he had like clocks, like multiple clocks from a from like a timers, like kitchen timers. it's you hear all the time like I want to help I don't know right me here a lot from reverts you know I want to I want to help save the puppies that don't have a home I tell people all the time if we were trying to raise money for dogs that died back so that we'd be sitting on a billion dollars it's true it's just is what it is why do you think we're still still spending billions and billions of dollars on all this research and all these studies and trying to figure it out because we just don't understand it that's why we you know we you talk about all timeers and CTE we don't even have the technology and the imaging to recognize these things in a living human we put a man on the moon in 1969 can't tell you if you have CTE wire life you know for me it's like hey let's step back and look at our priorities because one thing everyone's got is a brain everyone and the problem with the brain is there's no prosthetic for that you get the one you got and but I go see Ty mind you this time at this point I still haven't gotten like emotional one time like it's since I left do love like I haven't gotten emotional from my family or otherwise still pretty squared away with the emhole emotion thing I go see Ty but the the first guy the staffs are every day man every day and he started like he would walk in and like tickle where my right foot should be and it would tick it was crazy because it would tickle and it would not be like that come on bro Marines and and Ty whispered to the nurse and he said he wants to know like what are your injuries and I told him you know told him my injuries and uh started of course with you know a lost right leg didn't lose it You know, and he was one of the guys where if you tell him good morning, and he didn't tell you, if he said, if you don't hear something back like, go after your mom, if you hear like good morning back, Gunny, he's pissed about something and it's going to be a long day. but that's when I realized like all right I need to be this is what I gotta do this is this is what I'm gonna be called to do is to talk to other members of society who've been dealt whatever hand or been dealt a blow to let them know like but you know the guys in Vietnam too man those guys like like in Vietnam they wore blue jeans in the field they you know because they kept off leeches and they were tougher So I don't know, I think we got the call in 103 saying that we were going to be called, the certain time and it gave you like a warning order, like, okay, it's common pretty much. and I knew right then because I was like okay at this point I'd already started like if I was eating one if I had a family member friend give me a fentanyl pop out of my bag of goodies like I would chew it I'd bite it off the stick chew it up and swallow it and just lay on the stick i know i would have liked that fear of failure how do you overcome that also learns about the value of money a lot of people don't know that these days a lot of kids don't know that for sure mark in the book actually gets a job makes money refurbishes a bike basically gets after it so give the children that you know the ultimate gift and that is the gift of discipline shown the way the warrior kid and you will be stoked speaking of warrior kids and so put you mentioned earlier Like, it'll work like that for a little while and work for, you know, little while, but over time, those, those, those young guys will, or the junior people, if you're not leading them correctly, you're not going to get things down. well I'll tell you what I think that's probably a pretty good place to wrap we've been going for a while and especially because you just made very clear the reason why I wanted to have you come on this podcast now because you know again this ties everything together that I've been talking about for the past three podcasts you know you got a guy like was drink get rid and capuccinos I didn't eat ever because you feel like you're starving like you're really hungry that's why you this saying go you'll never need a fat drug addict that's true because you your mind's gonna tell you like man I think I think the ads I get it though you know because sometimes you leave your listening to his deal his thing whatever it is he's talking about it takes you mentally and kind of emotionally this face it emotionally into a certain spot and then it fades out into some hey do you want to I don't know whatever the ad is you know you want to get more kind of put some breaks on that there's been some of my new little things in the podcast especially for echo And, and you know, that's the, that's the incredibly hard part that we were talking about earlier is like when he's when his son comes home from Vietnam and, you know, he's like, his heart is broken. But, um, then it was, you know, boot was, was one of those things where you're part of the club, but not like, you know, you know, you're, when you're at S.O.I. how do they figure out what position you're going to be in a So, SOI, it's more of a number of things. where and I'm gonna leave the jars I'll be the first one to stand up on the soap box I'm just gonna open up my chest cavity pour my soul out in front of a group of people I've never met and say here's the shit I know with here's what I've been through this is what I'm doing to address it and this is how you can hold me accountable who's next there's a lot of power in that because we have to remember in our community you hear all the time be accountable to yourself be accountable to your brothers be accountable to your sisters unless you have brutal honesty first you have manufactured accountability so when I ask you how you're doing don't tell me good to appease me because I'm gonna call you on the shit be great you know and it's true by the way also another supplement called discipline that's what this one is right here it's like a cognitive in hand sir and being in some caffeine in there some good stuff some is there there's some vitamins in here there's a good one there's a really good one I mean take before you do something that you gotta use your brain and your body which is cool also mook mook is out it's protein powder jocos what I didn't like believe or not I did too and I told my leaves physician that came I said don't ever I don't want that stuff anymore like that was not like that was not a cool high like it was bad and I kind of found myself drifting away from the work I was doing at the center because it just wasn't it wasn't getting to the part of the soul that I wanted to be in and it wasn't getting to that like people I've been asked like how how long are you gonna speak because give the travel schedule you know it's brutal right like you just feel like complete crap it's so you're just going through that every just like almost on a permanent level I knew it would happen and so we were by the grace of God we had because we were part of weapons between but weapons company it just got done doing a coordinate knock or whatever they were doing and they're listening to this transmission over the net so we're talking with Battalion saying like hey this is escalating and there's about 65 of them and 10 of us so they were heavily outnumbered obviously but we need some serious shit is gonna go down and so weapons company pulls in I don't even remember if it's an hour later three hours it seemed like a freaking eternity but they pull in and make a circle around the ING good times bro so I had this this is the rule that I had as a patient you're not allowed in my room unless we share DNA or your United States Marine and that goes for the president on down I don't give a shit what your title is or who you are those are the rules if you don't have the same DNA as me and your United States Marine don't come in my room because I'm gonna let you know you're not allowed and that was because I'm in survival mode and survival mode I didn't know what that looked like while I was making it up as I got as I went and I mean the airmen and the reserve Marines and army guys like made this lying on either side of the back towards at the bird and it was like I don't rate what you guys are doing but appreciate it like I can dig it and he was whist he was telling Ty as I'm telling the injuries and it's seen as a sin lost right leg like Ty holds up his right leg like still got mine was it down and the left leg got banged up Bob I'm Ty holds up his left leg but you didn't I knew like because I was like hey listen if I just can't fill nothing matters if I'm completely numb nothing matters and then when they gave me that giant bag I was like oh shit because my my tactic at this point is gone way out the window did not matter your rank like did not matter and because I'm on a tip point where I'm like what are they gonna do shape my hands I mean all right please you'd be doing me a favor but the sun pissed and I call my dad and I'm like what part of my face has I give a shit that they're here I don't even know if it's a man or woman I don't care if they want to see me you know where my room is do I go to his or her office and say hey I'm gonna need you downstairs because I'm coming so and he comes up to decide my bed and remember the only thing worse my right arm and first one it leans down he puts his right arm out as if to like pick me up and so I grab like I clap hands with him as if he's gonna pick me up and when I fight like hell it's I'm usually a dick that was my survival man that was you just like angry were you angry you were hurt and pissed off that you were you're like was gone and but there's not how long was the process supposed to be six months so I did two and a half I was clean because I was like I'm not I can't continue to be this that that hardcore about face though I mean that that comment about look which I've said on this podcast many times like look we got to live to honor our brothers that didn't come home that's the way it is live well it's like an escape right like an escape and it brings like that pleasure for that exact all all the big you know when they pull in you know like okay those guys have big stuff that obviously goes bang a lot and so these guys pulled in and it was almost in unison the iron the iron can actually guard guys dropping their AKs hands in there but he's like you're in the page 11 and gunny was like oh do you want to contest this it's like hell You know, you're trained that, which, I'm not, I mean, I won't say if I agree, you're just agree with it now, because I, it's like I tell civilians like, think of them of the military as a giant will with a lot of spokes. okay this is not like a major so they did like a legit let they stopped stopped like so then it's a delay for me to even go to Santonio because they had to get you to recover you know this guy no shame if a whole guy from white says no shame is he's just saying don't be shy or if he's telling the story say a this person wasn't shy at that point like like if he says and here it is here's the example and I got to call other people and even there trying to take me to the OR to watch me out and reset my left leg left arm and redo the external fixators he was like he's walking right next to the bed like he's going into the OR with me But like if you're like, go after your mom, you're like sweets, Gunny's in a good mood. and when someone come in you'd be like you don't get that off me I don't know if you don't what you got like just aggro with people I know I know I'm like super hardcore and everyone knows that you know okay if I'm in the ice you I'm in this room with four other dude like it doesn't matter whatever right and um obviously I developed a development of a reputation at BAMC and I'm attached to four three condoms there at the time and it's right out right by BAMC and there's one marine there that the day I got there he was right there And at the time, my brother, I don't know if this is a draw for the time, where he was actually, she was for some reason here in, and so I count on and she was like, hey, come, you know, see me. but then it reminded me in a very abrupt manner who the hell are you to be acting the way you're acting because they're telling his family you better call anyone who wants to tell him goodbye because he's probably not gonna make it through the next 48 hours and here I was acting like a complete asset very much alive not having they weren't having to call anyone of my family or any of my friends because I was gonna make it at this point I'm gonna make it and that reminded me of it's not about you you just thought it was about you it's not about you and then that that one interaction taught me right then and I was angry because I could not contribute to what I was trained to contribute to with with my brothers like that's they were there and I was back home an air condition room with a bunch of people waiting on me hand and foot upon totally intended like that you know that's why I was pissed no they couldn't understand that So I'm fighting it like, like a moe, like I'm fighting it hard.
