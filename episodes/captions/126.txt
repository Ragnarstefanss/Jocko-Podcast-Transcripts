00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000 This is Jocco podcast number 126 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening, and tonight also joining us is Mr. David Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.000 On September 27, 1950, approximately 60 American prisoners who had been confined in prison were taken into the prison yard in groups of 14 with their hands wired together.
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:49.000 These men were forced to sit hunched and hastily dubbed ditches and then were shot by North Korean troops at point blank range with American M1 rifles using armor piercing ammunition.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:14.000 Two seriously wounded survivors only one lived to recount the gruesome details. Unnumbered civilians estimated at between 5,000 and 7,000 as well as soldiers of the Republic of Korea were also slaughtered between September 23rd and September 27th, 1950.
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:30.000 The first sergeant, Carrie H. Y. Now, formally with the 23rd Infantry Regiment 2nd Division, Korea was the sole survivor of the infamous Tejon massacre.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000 He testified at a congressional hearing and I'm going to read some of that transcript. Here's Sergeant Y. Nell.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:59.000 The last, they was in a hurry to leave Tejon to evacuate Tejon, so they took approximately the last three groups pretty close together. I witnessed the group right in front of me shot.
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000 And then, then, send her Potter asks, what happened to you when you were shot? Sergeant Y. Nell replies,
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000 I leaned over against the next man pretending I was done for. In firing, they hit my hand.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.000 Send her Potter. How were you? Sitting in the ditch? Sergeant Y. Nell. They was aiming at my head. I have a scar on my neck, one on my collarbone, and another in my hand. They hit me three times.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And you played dead? Yes, sir. After they thought everyone was dead, they started burying us. I came pretty close to getting panicky about that time, but somehow or another, I figured as long as I had some breath.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000 There was hope. In other words, you were buried alive. That is right, sir. I might add in that whole group that I was with.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000 There was not a man that begged for mercy, and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:25.000 Sergeant, how long were you buried alive? That is hard to say, sir. As I say, I was shot around five o'clock in the morning, and I stayed in the ditch until that evening, until what time it was dark.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000 I would say approximately eight hours, seven or eight hours.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:50.000 Now, that is from a report on Korean war atrocities written by the subcommittee on Korean war investigations. And I want to repeat one line again from Sergeant Y. Nell.
00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:05.000 He says, in that whole group that I was with, there was not a man that begged for mercy, and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 So think about that.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:30.000 Think about the will and the discipline of those men to be facing certain death that the hands of a murderous enemy, but to face death with solemn silence and show no signs of breaking.
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000 Said before that war brings out the worst in people, but it also brings out the best.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000 And that is but one of thousands upon thousands of examples of the dedication of our military fighting men.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:02.000 And I'm going to read you another example from the same war around the same time, but this one is an award citation.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:18.000 And it reads, the president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver star to first lieutenant armor Thomas Wilford five United States Army for gallantry in action as a member of company B 72nd tank battalion.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Second infantry division in action against an armed enemy on 19 September 1950 in the vicinity of young sang Korea.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000 On that date lieutenant five was in command of a platoon of tanks charged with the support of infantry elements in the defense of young sang perimeter.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:49.000 And a tactic position with superior numbers and a fanatic determination to penetrate through to the division main supply route.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:02.000 The enemy attack was successful in routing the friendly elements and inflicting casualties to the extent that the organization and combat effectiveness of the positions was completely disrupted.
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:15.000 The previous mission of the situation lieutenant five disregarded the heavy enemy fire and dismounted from the protective armor of his tank to reorganize the foot elements.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:28.000 After reorganization, he remained on the ground and successfully reestablished the positions by controlling both the foot elements and his tanks by means of radio communications.
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.000 The same date while engaged in a friendly attack against the enemy lieutenant five again displayed gallantry by refusing evacuation after being wounded.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:53.000 The leadership loyalty and gallant actions demonstrated that day by lieutenant five aren't keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000 So lieutenant five was under attack from devastating enemy fire, but he did not remain in the protection of his tank.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000 In fact, he did the opposite. He exited his tank to organize troops and stop the enemy attack. He risked his life to lead his men.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:25.000 Then he would continue to lead even after wounded. Now, Korea was not the first war for lieutenant five nor would it be his last.
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000 Lieutenant five had actually already fought in World War II. He fought in Korea and he fought in Vietnam.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000 He also received three purple hearts for each of the three times he was wounded once in each war.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000 And in addition to the silver star from Korea, he also received another silver star for his service in Vietnam and a Legion of Merit and a distinguished fine cross.
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000 And survived all that, and served our great nation for 25 years.
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:14.000 And I will say that it is my absolute honor to have retired Colonel Thomas Fife on the podcast today.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000 Sir, thank you for coming on.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000 It's nice to be here, I think.
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:38.000 I've listened to that story. It brought back years. Quite frankly, I'm upset just because of the memory of that.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000 It was a horrible experience, but when it had to get done, I still remember getting how that tank.
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000 I wonder in one day, I was doing it. But something had to be done.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000 When you see thousands of people coming at you, you have nothing but your weapons.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000 You and the guys needed some help. They were willing to.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000 I guess run, I don't know what they were. They needed leadership.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000 And that's all I think I could think of to get out and try to be there with them.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000 And I think God would turn them around and we were able to stop the enemy.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000 You can't understand what it's like to be there and having thousands of people come rushing at you.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000 And the best you can do is shoot your tank guns and you machine guns.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000 And they just kept coming. They just kept coming.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000 I mean, talk about discipline. Those guys were discipline too.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000 And we had to get our guys together and we did.
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000 And it was, I think I was lucky. I was damn lucky.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000 By the way, my wounds weren't that serious. I got shot and he asked.
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000 And it closed up. The wound closed up.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000 And so it stopped bleeding.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000 And for all practical purposes, I was as good as good as new for a while.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000 So I mean, it wasn't that serious a wound.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000 I mean, I, I, I would hope to be evacuated to Japan, but didn't work.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000 So you're million dollar wound turned out to be like a 50 cent wound.
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:56.000 At least it was, it was, you know, when you, when I got wounded, I felt the blood rush into my pants.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000 And then it stopped. So why not keep going?
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000 So, as I was concerned, the wound was dead over.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000 And when I finally got to the mass hospital, the doctor said,
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000 That's what we can do for you. It's going to work its way out or stay there forever.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000 It eventually worked its way out, which is how I ended up being evacuated
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000 when we were up in North Korea. And got to a hospital ship,
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000 and they, they took the piece of metal out of my butt.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000 And then my carthor just said, General McArthur said,
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000 We're going to be home by thanks by Christmas.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000 So my objective was to get off that hospital ship as fast as I could and get back to my units.
00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:03.000 And of course the Chinese hit. And so I was now trying to get back to my unit.
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000 And the Army was totally screwed up, but you didn't know where who was where.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000 So I ended up finding to be on Yang,
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000 and the land in Yang, the capital in North Korea, and the airfield was totally surrounded by fire.
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000 We were destroying all of our equipment and whatever else.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000 We landed there playing the plane landed, and I had to go find my unit.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000 And nobody knew where it was. So I got on the road and started hitchhiking.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000 Yeah, the guy came along, happened to be a classmate of mine who was in the middle of the corps.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000 He stopped saw me, picked me up, took me back to where he was, which was core headquarters.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000 And they didn't know where and how my outfit was.
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000 So finally they took me back to the mass hospital, another mass hospital.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000 And the mass hospital I'm nowhere my unit was.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000 And they took me back to my unit in an ambulance.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000 Now I wasn't wounded, there was just a way to convey it, get me back to my unit.
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000 I still remember those days. Terrible experience, but fun.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000 It's hard for people to understand that I have that discussion with people a lot when you're saying, hey, this is the worst time of my life.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000 And also the best time of my life at the same time.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000 Let's get into Korea, but let's talk a little bit about where you came from, how you grew up.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000 Starting with, I guess, Su-Sidi Iowa.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:10.000 That's right. Well, I was a kid growing up in the middle of the United States.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000 I was reminded, on the way over here, I was talking when Pearl Harbor happened.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000 I was 16 years old, I was in a movie theater.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000 And they stopped the movie and they announced that Japanese just bought Pearl Harbor.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000 I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was.
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000 And I knew where the Hawaiian Islands were, but I didn't know Pearl Harbor was in the Hawaiian Islands.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000 Well, you're in Iowa. There's no oceans.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000 Nobody knows. Nobody.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000 We don't think about oceans. And so here we were in this movie.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000 I was almost 16 as I said. And I said, well, hell, the world before I ever get called in.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000 Well, that turned out to be wrong.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000 So as I said, I was going through high school.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000 I told objective, well, I was in high school. It's going to become a chemical engineer.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000 You can go to Cornell University. Why?
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Because my best friends, oldest brother-in-law, was a chemical engineer working in Sumatra.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000 Well, you grow up in Iowa. Sumatra is sound like a pretty good thing to be doing.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000 So, that's why I wanted to be a chemical engineer.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000 And I was going to go to Cornell because he wanted to Cornell.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000 And that was going to be what I was going to do.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Well, the war happened.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000 And I suddenly became a team and you get drafted.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000 It's hard for people to realize today.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000 Every place you go, people are in uniform.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000 When people are walking around in sub-inclos, the only people who weren't sub-inclos
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000 are those who couldn't qualify because of physical disabilities.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000 So everybody was in uniform, no matter where you were.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 So I got drafted.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.000 And fortunately, my dad was smart enough to send me off to Iowa State before I was 18.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000 And I got two quarters in as an engineer.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000 So the Army in this great wisdom decided to make the incumbent engineer.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000 Which I've been in being an infant to be in as far as I was concerned.
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000 So I went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Now, when you're from Sumatra, Columbia, South Carolina is it.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000 He's on some way.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000 He took us five days on a damn train to get there.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000 So we got there in all of us soldiers could have to train.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000 And the first person got us all lined up there.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000 And he's calling and roll.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000 And he says, fee fee.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000 And I yell five. From that moment on, I was fee fee.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:47.000 So anyway, that was in March of 1944.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000 And so we went through basic train.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 It learned to be a incumbent engineer.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000 And I became a demolition specialist.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000 It's hard for people to realize, here's the kid who grows up in Suci's Iowa.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000 And suddenly it's handing explosives.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000 I had no more idea of doing that in the man in the moon.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:25.000 So in the training, we were primarily learning to build bridges and take care of roads.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000 That was our primary mission.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000 But we also were taught to be infantrymen.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000 Common engineers had a secondary responsibility.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:48.000 And so we ended up, fortunately, going to Europe,
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000 when we were in training, we had no idea what direction we were going to go.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000 But in retrospect, I've always felt that we were lucky to go to Europe,
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000 rather than into the southeast.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000 However, when I got to Europe, it was colder and hell.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000 I wasn't sure that was a really great decision.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000 It worked out all right.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:28.000 But our primary role was to go to Europe and become a take care of the roads and all the things that engineers do.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000 And so you showed up there, is it were you right around the battle of both time frame?
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Yes.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000 I mean, the battle of the roads was, I remember, right around Christmas time of 1944.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000 And we got to the continent at that time.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000 But our unit went to Luxembourg.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000 It primarily was helping General Patton's army,
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000 to make a 90 degree turn and go north to help stop the Germans.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000 And so the roads had to be taken care of.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000 And that's what our unit was doing.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:37.000 So during the actual combat at the best home, we were working on roads and keeping the roads open for the Patton's army to get up there.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:50.000 Our unit eventually eliminated the last Germans from Luxembourg.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.000 And a little town called Vyandon, which is on the hour river, right across from the Seek Free border, a Seek Free line.
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And so the 1250-15th Engineer Combat Battalion turned in an infantry outfit for brief, very time.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:19.000 February 12th, 1945, we got rid of all the Germans, last Germans in the country of Luxembourg.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:29.000 The combat engineers, I always want to give them their due, because they continued to keep roads open.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000 When we were fighting, in Ramadi it was the combat engineers primarily that they had the duty of mine clearance.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000 And it was a brutal and I mean obviously a highly dangerous job for them to be out there, clear in those mines and keep in those roads open.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000 That's a hell of a job.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000 I guess a demolition specialist, one of my other, one of my jows was mine clearance.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:11.000 And I was operating a mine sweeper on this road down into the valley at Vyandon, and behind me were the two tanks from the Calvary unit.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000 And Germans could see the tanks. I guess they could see us too, but they sure had held it.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:28.000 Looking at the tanks and shooting out the tanks. And a lot of their machine gun fire would ricochet off the tanks.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000 And that's how I got hit with ricochet off the dam tank.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:45.000 Got into my leg and arm. But superficially. I mean, all I just go back to the aid station and get managed up and back to my unit.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000 Wasn't any hospitalization at all that kind of stuff.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000 Another 50 cent wound for you.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000 Exactly. I mean, I had a lot of those.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000 So how long were you, so did you stay over in Europe until the war ended?
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:13.000 No, actually in March, the unit got orders from me to return to the United States because I had appointments to the United States military.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000 Okay.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000 And so my very first airplane ride was from Leace, Belgium, to Paris.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000 And I was, I remember going into this office in Paris, and I was dressed in my battle gear, so to speak.
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000 And they looked at me and they said, and I had it still everywhere.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000 I was still wearing my steel helmet. And I can still remember this sergeant scene.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000 We got to take her this guy. We got to dress him up.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And so they put me in all brand new clothes. Two days later, I was on a airplane flying back to United States.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000 Twenty seven hours later, and five stops in route.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000 We ended up in Washington, D.C.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:15.000 So I ended up, my first time at Everett's visit to Pentagon.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000 Here is this 19 year old PFC dressed in brand new clothes walking into the Pentagon.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000 And I can tell you, I wasn't sure what they were always doing.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:46.000 So I got orders to go to Cornell University. Cornell University, but for to get reacademic reacademic.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000 So you had orders to West Point, but they were going to send you to Cornell for a little while to prepare for it?
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000 Well, no, I had an appointment to the academy.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000 Okay. And if you had an appointment, the academy in fact, this is still to the day.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000 If you're having an appointment with the academy, take you out of combat and bring you back some place safe.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:24.000 And what they brought us back, there was about 300 of us at Cornell all from different parts of the service.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000 So we armed the air force, there was fact downstairs of the US Army Air Corps.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000 And we were there for them to get reacademic.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000 Turn your brain back on.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000 Yeah. Thank you.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000 So that was.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000 At this point, did you know you wanted to stay in the Army as a career?
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000 Had you enjoyed your time in Europe and you said, you know what I think I'm going to do.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000 Think of it as a distance or no.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000 I had no idea.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000 It wasn't until after.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000 Well, very quickly.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000 My appointment to the academy was an alternate appointment.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000 And as the principal, if he qualifies, he often doesn't get to go in my principal qualifies.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000 So, now what do they do with me?
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000 The Army is great infinite.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 It was the decided to send me to our security school.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000 So they sent me down to Fort Bell, Ward of the Engineer of Security School.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000 The Army knew they were going to need a lot of technical tennis or in the southeast Asia.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000 So anyway, in the middle of the officer Kennedy School, the Ward of Japan ended.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000 Now what?
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000 Well, they stopped the officer Kennedy's wrist.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000 Slow it down, I guess, as the right word.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000 And what I continued on in graduated in the January of 1945.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000 And here I was now a settle tennis.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000 So you got your commission?
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Yeah. And I had a principal appointment to the military academy.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000 So what are they doing?
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000 So they kept me at Fort Bell Ward training recruits.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000 And then in July, they discharged me from the Army.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000 The military academy is a good hit.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000 And July 1st, 1946.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000 It was somewhere in there that I started to like the Army.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000 I got it.
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000 But I knew if I wanted to be an engineer, I'd damn well had to get a college education.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000 Well, we're better to go than to.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000 The place that's most attractive to be an Army engineer, which is this case West Point.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000 So I went on to West Point and spent four years there, obviously.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 And graduated in 1950.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000 So you got commissioned?
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 They took your commission away for four years.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 And then they gave it back to you at the end of 40 years.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Yes.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000 The only rank I've ever had was an Army with twice, but second lieutenant.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000 Yes, that's right.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000 And West Point at this point is being run by just all World War II veterans.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000 I'm sure.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000 Yes.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:44.000 In fact, our tactical officers were all lieutenant colonels who had been
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:56.000 a commander of some sort in World War II in Europe or in their force, in fact, tactical officer of my company.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 The first two years was an artilleryman.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000 And the second two years was an Air Force.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000 Well, it was US Army Air Corps became the Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000 So, and then the superintendent was Maxwell Taylor.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000 And the commander was guy named Paul D. Hartman, who was Colonel Hartman.
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000 He was General Patton's hatchet man.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:36.000 And the deputy commander was a guy named John K. Waters, who was General Patton's son-in-law.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000 So, they were all World War II veterans.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000 And as we're at the time of that, had to be.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 Was that fairly unique?
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000 Was there a lot of other guys that were prior and listed that were coming to West Point?
00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:03.000 I'm of my class who started about 1100 of us.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000 I would guess several hundred were veterans of some sort.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:18.000 Navy, Army, Army Air Corps, yes.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000 I would say about 200 to 300.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000 I don't remember exactly.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Now, when you're going through West Point, the war ends.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000 Are you, is war on the horizon for you?
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000 Or did you guys have an attitude kind of like, well, you know, we're going to go and be peace-time Army officers for the next, however many years?
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Or did you see trouble brewing?
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 No, no trouble brewing.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000 I mean, I don't think anybody really for self-what was going to happen to Korea.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:06.000 In fact, the only thing that was trouble, if you would was Berlin Air Lift was happened while we were at Cadets.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000 And so we saw that kind of thing, but I guess maybe in our naivety, we figured that nobody was going to be there.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000 Nobody was going to pull the plug and really have the Russians attack or vice-presimal.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000 We're going to do anything.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000 So when you graduate, what's your next move?
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 What was your next move after you graduated?
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000 Well, it wasn't my move.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000 North Korea invaded South Korea and here General President, President Truman decided to send US troops to
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000 Korea.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:03.000 Now, one of the things when you graduate by order of rank, you're allowed to choose your branch and then where you want to go.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000 Well, my experience was being in front of that tank and getting a scrap rail.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000 I decided I didn't want to be out in front of the tank.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000 I wanted to be in the tank.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000 So I chose not to be an engineer again.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000 I chose to go in an armor.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:38.000 So I chose to go to once again, run up an Iowa, stay in a washing with somewhere who knows where.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 So I chose Fort Lewis, Washington.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000 That's a place I'd want to go visit.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:59.000 So that's my first post was to go to Fort Lewis, Washington, to turn out to be the 29th, no, the 72nd tank of time, which was part of the second information.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:09.000 President Truman, while I was on my honeymoon in Canada, decided to send the second division off to the country.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000 So it was not just a career.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000 So in my infinite wisdom, not knowing this had happened.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Well, I was in Canada and I called home to wish my mother and dad happy for the July.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Oh, the Army had sent a telegram to my parents house saying, for me,
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000 to get my ass to Fort Lewis as soon as possible.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000 Well, I'm halfway there, up and up in the El Verde Canada.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:58.000 So we drive off to Fort Lewis and saw a private Fort Lewis village lie.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.000 Now, you've got to, I'm now a tank of a two-liter, never been in a tank before.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000 Let me tell you, that's an experience, most people don't want to have.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:23.000 I said, only thing I had gone, by the way, many years later, what Patuon said,
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:35.000 that time he was my gunner. He said, we've really fortunate we had a guy who had been in combat in World War II.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000 Not knowing that I didn't know a damn thing about a tank.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000 But the good news is the Sergeant was smart enough to teach me how to be somewhat of a tanker.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000 On the ship, on the way over to Korea.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000 So you had no, you showed up, you get done with your, or you cut short your honeymoon.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000 You go straight to Fort Lewis and then you immediately load up.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000 Yes. My first tanker was from the port, not from the motorpool at Fort Lewis,
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000 to the port of Olympia, to put the tank on the ship and goodbye.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000 That was my first tanker.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000 Yes, the point you made about, you know, not just that your, your Sergeant was smart enough to teach you,
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000 but equally important is that you were smart enough to listen and we're getting,
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000 all kinds of young officers and I'm sure you saw them through the years that they're not smart enough to listen to the people that have the experience
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000 and that's a huge lesson learned that seems to always need to get learned by people.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000 I wish I told more people when I asked,
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000 what do you do to be successful? I say listen to your Sergeant's.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000 Listen to your Sergeant's.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000 Ask them. Don't be afraid to ask because they'll tell you, their job is to make you successful.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000 Yeah.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000 And unfortunately there are too many people who don't have egos that can allow them to do that.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000 No doubt about it.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000 Yeah.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000 They think it's going to make them look bad when it actually, they actually elevate some of the eyes of the Sergeant.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Yeah.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000 And yeah.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:24.000 So your trip overseas, you're on the ship and you show up in Korea.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Yes.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000 You can't understand what it's like to be several miles offshore and begin to smell.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000 What's going to be turned out to be the port of Busan.
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000 You could smell it before you ever got there.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000 And we knew we were pulling into, and I've never, I've never been to that far the world in my whole life.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000 And we offloaded ourselves from the trip ship.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:11.000 What if our tanks to come on the other ships and we spent four days in Busan waiting for the equipment to come.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000 And then offloading it and getting ready to go into battle.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Then at what point, this is like the battle of Busan.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 This is the Busan perimeter.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 Yeah.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000 And this is the beginning of it right now.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:37.000 For those of you that don't know, this is North Korean troops coming down a hundred thousand North Korean troops coming down and have you guys basically squeezed onto, it's almost a peninsula.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000 It's like a little knot of land that sticks out.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000 It's 35 miles radius from the city of Busan, was the Busan perimeter.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000 That was the last territory held.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000 Everything else was held by the North Koreans.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 And so when you landed there, that's the situation they were in.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000 Yes.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000 And how did you guys, and how did you, and your troops, feel about that?
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:14.000 I don't think we were even cognizant of how serious it was.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000 After we loaded the tanks onto the rail cars,
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000 you go to the, the rail head of Maryying, which is,
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000 I don't know the 20 miles, 25 miles from Busan,
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000 where we are offloaded the tanks.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000 It's where I first went into combat in Korea.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000 I don't really know that we thought how serious it was.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:55.000 It got, got the impression several days later when the division system division commander
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000 called all the officers and singer NCOs together in a place.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000 And he said, men we live are die here.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000 And I've thought to myself, what in the hell did I get myself into here?
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000 But that's, that's what it was.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:28.000 I mean, we, you know, in hindsight, I've read books about what happened in Korea.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000 And we really didn't understand it.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000 I mean, we were just, they're doing a job.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000 And I don't think we really understood how perilous a situation was.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000 And at any point, while you were there, did you understand the peril of the situation
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000 or were you just in your particular battles day by day trying to hold the line
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000 where you were and didn't, was the communications kind of not effective enough
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000 to really, for you to understand the bigger picture?
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000 We had no idea what the bigger picture was.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000 I mean, honest to God, we were just doing our job.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:17.000 And as I said earlier, watching these waves of people come across the Nattoon river
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000 will never, ever go away from my memory.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000 I mean, people were just coming, coming, coming, coming.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 And all we were doing was shooting, shooting, shooting.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000 And they were just, keep coming.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000 And we managed to hold the line.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000 And they didn't penetrate.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000 So, no, the answer is, we didn't understand perilous a situation.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000 As you were, you hold the line specifically, you guys, you were holding the line on that river.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 Yes.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000 Were they swimming?
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000 Were they taking boats?
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000 Were they doing?
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000 They were waiting.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000 It wasn't that deep.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000 It wasn't that deep.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000 It was pretty wide river, but it wasn't that deep.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000 So, they were able to weigh the cross.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000 Yeah.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000 And they would just keep coming.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000 And then how long did that particular?
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000 How long were you under intense waves of attacks like that?
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000 It was like a 20 days or something of the whole thing I think lasted.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000 I don't know, 20 days or something.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000 Yeah, exactly.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000 I don't know.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000 It seemed like forever.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:54.000 But I think it was probably over in two or three, a couple of weeks.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000 The first involvement, we got off the tank's off the flat car.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:19.000 And then we rolled into action and my lead tank, and Fred and my very eyes exploded.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000 And it will never forget watching the tank commander go sailing out into the ditch into the right,
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000 in the tank exploding.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000 We arounded a curve and unbeknownst to us.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000 There were two Russian tanks, man by the Koreans, up just raw, and they fired at this tank.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:00.000 And we had my potential was in force, Sherman tanks, and gas engines.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000 And they fired, and since they fired into the gas tank, the whole thing exploded.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:19.000 So my first day in Korea combat, one tank destroyed, five people at that time were tank head crew of five,
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000 were all far more killed than the tank commander was back in the United States and less than two weeks after we left,
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000 over three weeks after we left.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:38.000 And that was my first day in combat in Korea.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000 So from then on, we got into the perimeter and spent a couple of weeks there.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000 I don't remember.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000 You read earlier at my dissertation on September 19th, which was when I was,
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.000 I don't remember what exact date dates it was, because it wasn't too long after that happened,
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000 that we had in Shonland in everything broke out and we were head and north.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000 So there was a couple weeks, I don't know.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:29.000 When you were from a leadership perspective dealing with losing guys in comparison to when you were in World War II,
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000 and you weren't necessarily in command of guys, but you're seeing people get wounded, you're seeing people get killed.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000 What was your mindset?
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000 What was your perspective as a leader when the guys were getting wounded, guys were getting killed?
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000 And then you had a bunch of, you know, you were saying that your sergeant, they felt they were lucky to have someone that had been in combat,
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000 that had been in combat before, and then all of a sudden I know that they were looking to you saying,
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000 okay, well, what do we do now, boss?
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:10.000 Well, one thing about, in a tank, the crews are inside the tank, and as, with the radio,
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000 you could direct people to do this and do that.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000 And so I just told them what they should be doing, and they did it.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:34.000 I mean, I didn't, leadership is just telling people what they should do, and they're trying to do it, and they do it.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:49.000 I mean, I learned, actually I learned, I talked to, grown up on high leadership, I didn't even know what that was.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000 I learned what leadership was all about at West Point.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:05.000 And that's the major difference. When I was in World War II, I was just taking care of myself.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000 I wasn't really too concerned about the other guy, what was going on.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000 We were all just doing our job.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000 That's very different when you're in a combat situation.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000 And you got people to pin on each other.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000 And we were all dependent upon each other when we were at a tank, but two.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000 And each of us were trained to do a job, and they did it.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:49.000 I mean, one of the things my but two didn't exist prior to, on paper, it existed.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000 It didn't exist physically.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.000 So what happened when we were activated, the guard house was empty out.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000 And we got replaced from Fort Hood, Texas, and that was my but two.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.000 One of the best soldiers in my but two was my loiter, who had spent most of his army career in the guard house.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000 But you can't believe what a great soldier was in combat.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000 I mean, because he knew what he was doing, and he was trained to do it, and he did it.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I will never forget those young men.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:40.000 I'm still in email contact with my former gunner, who's now retired as a command sergeant major.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000 But he still calls me little tenets.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000 Because he was, he kept my ass on a trouble.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000 I'll tell you that right.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000 I mean, he taught me more about how to be a, but two leaders in anybody will ever understand.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:09.000 And I guess the leadership trainer I had at West Point, combined with what he's young men were teaching me.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:19.000 It allowed me to become pretty effective a leader throughout not just my military career, but my commercial career too.
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:30.000 I, I, I strong believer in that leadership works, not just in the military, but in commercial business.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000 Yeah.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000 You talked about leadership inside of tank.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:47.000 What did you see and, and how did you see what was going on that got you to get out of that tank and tell you that you needed to get out of that vehicle and start directing was going on in the ground.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 I wish I knew the answers to that.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000 I mean, it just did it.
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000 I mean, I knew something had to be done.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000 And my radio communications with these guys on the ground wasn't working.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:19.000 So you've got to, you've got to communicate in the only way you can communicate if the radio isn't working, you've got to get your butt off the, off the tank and down there so you can talk to these guys.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Because they weren't trying to talk to me.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000 I was trying to talk to them and get them, figure out what the hell they should be doing.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000 So I just did it.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000 I don't know what prompted me to do it.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000 It's a good question because I have no idea.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000 You know, I, I, I talk about that sometimes.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:52.000 I talk about, as a leader being able to identify what I would call, it's, I just called the void of leadership and it's very easy to see when you are used to seeing leadership,
00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:02.000 you know, you know, having a deep feeling of feeling the void when you see a void of leadership, if you're aware to look for it, it's really easy to see when it's there and you go wait a second someone needs to step in here and take charge.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000 And so you had that instinct of hey, there's a void of leadership here.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000 I got to do something and here we go.
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 It's right.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000 As much as you said to yourself at one point, I'm going to be inside that tank.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000 And then the damn time you needed to tank, you got out of it.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000 Well, well, in hindsight, you had to do what you had to do.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000 Absolutely.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:46.000 And then when what, once you guys held the line and you know, it's funny because I used that expression a lot, just talking about, you know, holding your line with your personal discipline and holding the line with your, your subordinates and we use it metaphorically and it's incredible to see here and talk to you about actually literally holding the line.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:59.000 When you guys got done holding the line and you had defeated that, that onslaught from from the North Koreans, what was the next phase?
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000 Move out and move north and we.
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:13.000 The first week, we moved four or five miles at the most.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:22.000 The next couple weeks, we moved hundreds of miles and I remember.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:32.000 Going as fast as we could, north and to marry up with the guys who invaded it in just.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000 And we just kept going.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:49.000 I, and I don't remember how many opportunities we had to really get into combat.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000 After we, we had to push on perimeter until after we got north of, uh, civil.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:07.000 I mean, we, uh, invading, I mean, the invasion force of, uh, invaded pretty well clear to that stuff away.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:18.000 And so the city of Seoul was open when we, we went right through it and, uh, we kept going north.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:30.000 The enemy was retreating pretty fast and we were just going as fast as we could drive enough to roads and, uh, in fact, uh,
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:40.000 our unit got almost the yellow river, uh, which is about the time to decide to take the,
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000 take the stuff out of my butt.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000 So I, I was sent back to the hospital ship and in the harbor.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000 So that's when you got strappin' was when you were up by the, by the yellow river?
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000 No, no, that's-
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000 Oh, that had already, that's right. That had happened earlier and the house was coming back.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000 The, the stuff was working.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000 No, one of the things you, you got to remember is this piece of metal is in my butt.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:18.000 Now, in a tank, the tank commander sits his little thing to sit his butt on while he's riding around in the turret.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000 Well, you don't do that when you have a piece of metal working his way out. It is painful to say the least.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:34.000 And so I couldn't hardly wait for that to happen, but they wouldn't let me go back to the hospital until they got raised and we closed to the surface.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000 So when they got close to the surface, they evacuated me.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000 And it was in November of 1950 that they sent me back to the hospital ship.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000 And then you, then I think you covered this, but then you got done. The metal comes out.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000 And then you go back again because you're trying to, you're thinking you're going to get home by Christmas if you can get back to your unit.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000 And I got back to the unit eventually, but I didn't get home by Christmas.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:15.000 In fact, the, by the time I got back to the unit, we were, the second division that already moved back south almost to the Han River.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:33.000 And so I found the unit again somewhere south of somewhat north of the Han River, but still, we were still in North Korea, but it was the south part of North Korea.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000 And were you in a, in a situation, did you guys get dug in?
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000 Because I know part of the Korean War was like they dug in and it was almost like trench warfare.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000 Did you enter that phase? Or were you still, guys still moving north and south?
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000 We, as tanks we never dug in.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Now, later on, I think the line stabilized pretty much around the 38th barrel.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000 And there was a lot of digging in defensive positions as well.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000 But that was more infantry not, not to tanks.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000 So how did you, how did you end up, what was the last phase of you being over there?
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Like, and what ended up bringing you back to the States?
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:33.000 Well, the, the line sort of stabilized around the 38th barrel.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000 And we would go forward and then we'd come back.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000 We would go forward, come back.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Oftentimes, the, we would do patrolling, I guess, is the right word, patrolling in the forest.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:09.000 A tank company was a niffin to come to your attach, ready, and on the tanks would blast forward to some enemy position.
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000 You didn't do a firefight, take the ground, and then we'd move back again.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:24.000 We were just going back and forth around that so-called,
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:34.000 now turned out to be the 38th barrel, but it was generally that sector.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:44.000 Oftentimes, the infantry would get into a lot more heavy firefight, and the tanks would.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:53.000 I spent a lot of time supporting infantry attacks with my tank guns, and machine guns covering their vast fine.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000 Advancements forward, but, uh, Doug and no, we never, the tanks were never Doug and.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000 And then how long did that last for?
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000 How long did was your unit deployed over there?
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000 Was it the whole unit that, that ended up going home?
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000 No, no.
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:20.000 At a certain point that you cited, at people who had been there a year would come home.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.000 And we started rotation, and I was one of the first ones to rotate out of my unit,
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000 because I had some decorations, and because I'd been there a year, and it's set,
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:49.000 I had a lot of points, and so I was sent back, but I guess I've got back to the United States.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000 Labor Day of 1951.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000 So I was evacuated, the word evacuated is probably not the right word.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000 I was just sent back home.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000 And then, so you get back home.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000 You know, you are coming home from Korea.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000 Obviously, you at least experienced some pretty intense stuff, and you know, you hear a lot of times,
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:25.000 especially nowadays with guys coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, with guys struggling to re-adapt to life back in America.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000 And I think it's a little bit different, because when you came home, you were still in the army.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000 And I think that's the best thing for veterans, you know, if you're still in, I think the veterans that have the hardest time are veterans that get out,
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000 and all of the sudden, the brotherhood that they are used to is gone, and the mission that they're used to is gone.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:48.000 But is that what you experienced and you came home, and you still had your mission of moving forward in the army?
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:56.000 Yes, I mean, I had no feeling of not being appreciated.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:09.000 I mean, obviously, I came back, I came back, I had a daughter born while I was in Korea.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:22.000 I was scared to hell out of me. I mean, I still remember this four months old child, I hold for the first time.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000 First of all, I ever hold anybody that size.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000 Scared to hell out of me.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000 I was more scared about that than a lot of the things that happened to me.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000 But anyway, I came back, went to Fort Knox.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000 Now they simply just school learned to be a battalion leader.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:51.000 And so, and then they asked me if I wanted to stay there for a Knox and run an off-sourcanny company.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:59.000 And I did. And so, I spent several years running off-sourcanny company.
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.000 And then they decided they didn't need any more off-sourcanny at Fort Knox, so they closed that down.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000 And I got to select it to be an aide to John Waters.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000 John Waters is a gentle patents, a son and a law.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000 And a wonderful experience learned a lot from a real gentleman.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000 He was a burger general at that time, the two stars.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000 But he eventually retired as a four-star general.
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000 But he taught me a lot about being an officer.
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000 Not so much about leadership, but being an officer in New Germany.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000 He was an outstanding person.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000 And I learned from him.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000 When you're working as an aide, you get pretty close to somebody.
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000 And I always feel very fortunate that I was able to be his aide.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000 And I don't know if you know, he's the one in the movie about general patents.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000 And then troops in to rescue somebody in a prisoner work camp.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000 He was the one who was in the prisoner work camp.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000 And he was wounded very seriously there.
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And it was quite an experience working for him for several years.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000 That was multiple years.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000 Part of multiple years as an aide.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000 I spent two and a half years as an aide.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.000 So, and then he went on to his assignments.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000 I went on to my assignments.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:24.000 And one of the experiences I had in 1956, I was a company commander of a Shaint company in Bob Molder, Germany.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000 And he at that time was running the military assistance command and Yugoslavia.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000 And he decided to come up and visit me.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000 Now he's the major general.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000 And he's coming to visit this captain in Bob Molder, Germany.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000 And it was, you can't believe all the other stuff that went on.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000 What the hell is he general coming to see you for?
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000 It's et cetera, et cetera.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000 But anyway, we got through all that.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000 But he was, he didn't come to visit me in Vietnam.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000 When he was Pacific commander.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000 But he was, he took care of watching what I was doing.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000 So it was an experience.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000 One of the experience and a great learning experience to be his aide.
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000 Yeah, I was actually an aide too for the Admiral.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000 That wasn't charge of all the seals.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000 And it was a very similar situation for me.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000 It was a great guy.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000 And I learned a ton about about the way the whole big machine worked.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000 You have no idea when you're a young lieutenant.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000 You have no idea what's going on behind the scenes.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000 And I definitely got to learn a lot about that.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000 And the same thing you just talked about, you know,
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000 I had a great relationship with him.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000 And he took care of me and my guys on many occasions,
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000 which was great.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000 And since he was the Admiral,
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000 one time we were to use a surfer.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000 And I was organizing a trip for us to go to Hawaii.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 And we were going to see some of the seals that were stationed out in Hawaii.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000 And the big thing I had to do is get organized so that when we got picked up at the airport,
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000 there were surfboards in the vehicles ready to take us directly to surfing.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000 As soon as we showed up,
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000 the same people say,
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000 what do you want these surfs?
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000 You just get the surfboards ready.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000 That's what you did for the boss.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000 And then so you did that.
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000 You end up, you end up,
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000 so 56 year-over-your-competitive commander.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000 And what happens in between then and then?
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000 What?
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000 And then?
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:47.000 I was in a unit, second-harm division.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000 And at that time, in 57,
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000 they had something they were going to rotate the force division,
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000 which was the armoured division, which I had been in for the hood.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000 The road take it to Germany,
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000 and the second armoured division,
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000 got to rotate back to Port Hood.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000 However, I had only been in country for a little over a year.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000 And I wasn't eligible to rotate back.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000 So they were in their decision for those of us who weren't eligible,
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000 had to be reassigned.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000 And I was reassigned to be at the Second Terry General Staff.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000 It had Albert, which is US Army Europe.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000 So now I'm going from being a company commander and bomb-holder Germany,
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000 which is the end of the line.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000 All the way to the very senior Army command in Europe.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000 And I'm working now for a four-star general in his general staff organization.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000 And I had once again a chance to go from learning,
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000 knowing what's going on down here,
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000 to watching what's going on,
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000 very senior leadership.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000 And it was another opportunity for a year and a half,
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000 I had that job, and it was just a great experience learning.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000 If you would be the other extreme of where you'd been,
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000 that was my, and then rotated back to the United States in 59
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000 to become a math professor at West Point.
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000 But I spent four years in the math professor.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000 And then went to the Army command general staff college
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000 out at Fort Leavenworth.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000 And then the Army decided that they needed to have people,
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000 counteracting, McNamara's whiskers.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000 And so they figured that somebody would have been teaching math,
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000 probably could have done.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000 So they sent me the University of Michigan to get a degree
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000 in, which turned out to be operations research.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000 But the Army sent me to get a degree in,
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000 I didn't make a data processing,
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000 which they didn't have such a thing at Michigan.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000 But the closest thing to it was industrial engineering operations research.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000 So I spent two years there getting a degree.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000 And then I rather than go back to the Pentagon for utilization
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000 to where I volunteered to go to Vietnam.
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000 So I, and when you say that they were,
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000 that the Army knew that they needed someone to counteract the whiskers.
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000 And I've talked about the whiskers,
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000 and I've covered them somewhat because
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000 a lot of the people operational on the ground said,
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000 hey, these statistics that you're coming up with
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000 don't take into account the human aspect of these
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000 kind of discomfort in Vietnam.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000 So was that something that was felt and understood inside the Army at that time?
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000 I mean, clearly it was.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000 Yes, and that's, the whole idea was to take somebody
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000 who knew something about the Army and give him some education
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000 to these kids, so-called kids had,
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000 and to take a little analysis on all that stuff.
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000 And so to be the other part of the board,
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000 and that was to be my utilization tour.
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000 So there's a great example that,
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000 and it's the Battle of the I-Drain Valley,
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000 and Colonel Moore talks about it.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000 The fact that what the whiskets basically said,
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000 one of the things that they said was,
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000 okay, we can kill 170 Vietnamese soldiers
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000 for every one of ours that they kill.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000 So statistically, we'll just keep running that problem over and over again,
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000 and we'll end up winning.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000 And I always point out,
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000 and which everyone points out,
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000 and I'm sure you would point it out as well as
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000 what they didn't take into account is the fact that number one,
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000 170 Vietnamese killed to the Vietnamese,
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000 was not as big of a deal as we thought it would be,
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000 and we also didn't take into account that one American dead
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000 is a lot bigger than the statisticians thought it would be to us.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000 And that's just a huge tragedy to go into that situation like that.
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000 Well, in fact, I,
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000 many times thought body count was a dumbest thing we've ever come up with
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000 as a measure of success in combat.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000 And I've said that,
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000 I don't know how many times,
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000 and I still convinced that was a dumbest thing we've done over the time,
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000 and I was there participating in it,
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000 and it was terrible.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000 So let's go to Vietnam.
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000 So you volunteered for Vietnam in 1966?
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000 Yes.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000 Or 65?
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000 66.
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000 Okay.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000 And did they automatically say,
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000 okay, well, your Lieutenant Colonel, that means you're going to take over a squadron of Italian?
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000 I wish that was okay.
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000 The fact that the fact that you give the army more credit for it than just do.
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000 Now, based, along with everybody else,
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000 I was a Lieutenant Colonel, I arrived in country,
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:05.000 and I was assigned initially to be the executive officer of the combat operations center of McVee,
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000 which was the headquarters of all.
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000 And the combat operations center was Westmoreland's Operation Center,
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000 and it was run by a Marine Brigadier General, Bill Jones by a name,
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000 and it was a great man.
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000 I mean, and I was his exact.
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000 And we, quote, ran the war, sort of speak,
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.000 the word we as a very loose term from the COC.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000 And that was, had quarters right there in Sagan.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000 And it was a cushy job.
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000 I mean, I mean, I went to work on a regular hourly basis.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000 I used to go in at night once in a while,
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:09.000 because President Johnson was going to talk to some of the action officers trying to find out what was happened to these patrols that we were sending out.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000 That's a serious sign of micro management, huh?
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000 Let me tell you, that was a micro management of the first order, and I saw it.
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000 Absolutely saw it, and happening more often than I cared to remember.
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000 But I had one of the evenings.
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000 I met one of my former colleagues, Armour, who was commanding the first,
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000 the fourth gallery of the first different division.
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000 He told me he was going to rotate home in December.
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000 I said, can I get that job?
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000 He said, he, he, he, he, take me up and introduce me to General Depue,
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000 who was the vision commander.
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000 And I went up on, I passed the test.
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000 He'd have to know General Depue, and he was a no-non-sense guy.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000 He, he would, people thought I was crazy, because General Depue was a relieving,
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000 but dying commanders for incompetence, right and left.
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000 And I figured, you know, if you go up and do your job, you're going to be okay.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000 Don't went up.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000 And General Depue introduced me, and General Hollins worked there.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000 It was the system to be a commander.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000 And Hollins worked in both the no-cavorymen.
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000 I mean, and he couldn't, the two of them passed on me.
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000 He said it was okay.
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:56.000 And so I got reassigned to command of the first and fourth gallery in December of 1966,
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000 which was a plumb job.
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000 That was, it was not only a plumb outfit, but General Depue used the cavalry squadron,
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000 like it should be used.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000 Many times later, my successors were all not as lucky as I was.
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000 I mean, I was able to fight my unit, has the unit.
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:37.000 I had three ground troops, one cow, a meadow.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000 D-trupe was a helicopter troop.
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000 I had 31 helicopters in it.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:54.000 And I had division commander would assign a B-comme of the tank battalion that was assigned to my unit.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000 And since there wasn't any real enemy aircraft, he assigned several of the batteries of the enemy aircraft
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000 unit to my unit.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:17.000 So I had a unit to unparalleled in history because General Depue believed the cavalry was supposed to go find the enemy.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000 And keep them there until his infantry could show up.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000 And we did it more often or not.
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:36.000 And one of the stories I tell people, I'm self-styled king of the Mr. rubber plantation,
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000 which is 70 square miles of trees.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:51.000 And historically, there's little communities of workers throughout the space.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:01.000 And it became these little towns became havens for the North Vietnamese.
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:10.000 And so we took it upon ourselves to evacuate everybody out of the little villages to the perimeter of the...
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000 Plantation.
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:23.000 And then took it upon ourselves to destroy the villages because the North Vietnamese were coming in at night,
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000 using these places and shallon art units.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000 So we were destroying all these little handlers.
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:41.000 In fact, I had an engineer come here assigned to me.
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000 And one of the contests was between the captain, who was the engineer come to Commander in myself.
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000 I'd be of my chopper.
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000 And he'd be down on the ground.
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000 And he was going to implode these villages.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000 Now if he imploded them all, he won.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000 And any of the villages built into what still be standing, I won.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000 Now what did we win of beer?
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000 And more often than not, I won. He didn't lose many.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:27.000 But we got...so in the spring of 1967, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrives in Vietnam.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000 The first unit he wants to visit is mine.
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:42.000 Everybody is...what in the world is, why did he pick this and why does he come to see you?
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000 When he gets out there and all of them, he's got a forestyle general, a couple of them.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000 Three-star general and then Division Commander all with them.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000 And then we're out in the middle of nowhere. I'm briefing them ambassador.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000 I get emotional, I say this.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000 He says, Colonel, I got more correspondence of my desk from the French about what in the hell you're doing up here.
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000 Just trying their village and all the people and calling in all this commotion.
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000 What are you doing and why are you doing it?
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:26.000 And I explained to him that why we were doing it because they were being havens for the north.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000 And they were coming in and yelling at killing our troops.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000 And now I always remember him saying, Colonel, you just keep doing what you're doing.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000 I'll take care of the French.
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000 And I said, God bless you.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000 I mean, I still get emotional with that man.
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000 That gentleman understood what the hell was going on.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000 And here we talk about state-department.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000 People are not knowing what's going on. He knew what was going on.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000 And he told me to keep doing what I was doing.
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000 And I did it.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 But I will always remember him.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000 I think at the time, I'm not sure this.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000 He was either the oldest or the oldest ambassador we ever had in the state department.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000 But he was out there trapping around and the bunnies with me.
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000 And it was a rare experience.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:29.000 But anyway, it was one of those days when you really think you counted.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000 Yeah.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000 And he was, to me, that's leadership too.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000 He was, he knew what the hell was going on.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000 He was able to tell me to keep doing what I was supposed to be doing.
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000 Yeah. He was a great man.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000 So those operations that was at the primary type of operation that you'd be doing is going into areas.
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000 And basically disrupting what the enemy was up to.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000 Basically, the mission was searching destroy.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000 And what we did was go find, try to find the enemy.
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000 And then destroy him.
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000 So in that, in the mission plantation,
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000 we thought the enemy was not there.
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000 But we spent, there was something called the iron triangle.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.000 North of Saigon is about 30 miles north of Saigon,
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000 which was our operational area.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:51.000 And it was traditionally a haven for the north.
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000 And or the whoever.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000 Anyway, the guys that were shooting at us.
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000 And you never know whether the north of it in the maze
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000 or the constructed south feed in the maze.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000 But they all looked the same to me.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000 And they still do.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000 I'm never in Korea.
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000 I couldn't tell a difference between the north Korean and the south Korean.
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000 I still couldn't never tell a difference between the south.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000 The enemy is the north feed in the maze.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000 It made me, there's a way, but I never figured it out.
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000 And so we just went in and constantly were searching and destroying.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:38.000 And if we find the enemy in strength, our job was to hold them there until General Peo and
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:46.000 get his infantry into helicopters and bring them in and really defeat the enemy.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000 On occasion we got in more of a firefight and we expected to be.
01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000 But we generally were pretty good at finding them.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000 And the tanks were all right through this forest and knocked the trees right down.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000 And it was no problem at all.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And I was in my helicopter directing.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000 And you could see and you tell the tanks were to go.
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.000 And the tanks and the AKs, which were primarily what the unit was all about.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000 And so we, that was our job.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000 So often I read about units that were over there that never or very, very seldom would
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000 they see the enemy.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000 They would lose guys to sniper fire.
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000 They'd lose guys to mortar fire.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000 They'd lose guys to booby traps.
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000 But very seldom would they see the enemy.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000 And obviously there's units that are different than that.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000 But it sounded like you were able to find the enemy on a fairly regular basis.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000 Oh yes.
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000 Are they found us on that?
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000 Who finds who is not sure there's an answer to that.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Yes, we were more often that we got in, we had contact.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:23.000 I had more than I would like to admit casualties, which didn't happen because they couldn't find the enemy.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000 I can tell you they could find us, you know, often remember somebody at a long time
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000 in my career tell me something about reconnaissance by fire.
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000 And I remember, well, the tank you had a lot of machine guns and you could do a lot of
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000 reconnaissance by fire.
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:52.000 And in the trouble of other reconnaissance by fires, you never know whether they see or not.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000 You just know there's somebody shooting at you.
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000 Well that's good enough.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000 That's good enough.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000 You don't need any.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000 No, whether you're aiming at you or not.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:15.000 When you, one of the things that also I talk about and I've read a lot about is the Vietnam War being very difficult
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000 from a leadership perspective for some leaders, more than others, but because you had drafties.
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000 And you had drafties, not just drafties that got drafted and okay, I'm going to go do my duty,
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:35.000 but drafties that got drafted that literally did not believe in what was happening and barely even believed in America as a country.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000 How much of that did you see and what was your leadership approach to those troops?
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000 I saw zero of them.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000 I mean, I don't know.
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000 I was just absolutely lucky.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000 I know I'm not that naive.
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000 I'll tell you, I, the last few guys have been talking to you in reading about this and,
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000 and there's something that I've noticed a trend.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000 So have you heard the term millennials about the new up and coming kids?
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000 I know what millennials are up.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000 So people complain about, you know, especially from a leadership perspective, people talk to me about,
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000 well, you know, I've got my company and we've got these new, these kids checking in their millennials.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000 They're different.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000 They're entitled.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000 They don't want to work as hard.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000 And I started thinking about my head.
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000 Well, basically you've got a, a work force.
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000 That's a little bit different.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000 And this is very similar to the drafty using Vietnam who had a different attitude.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000 And what I found from good leaders is it didn't matter.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000 It didn't matter that they had drafty.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000 It's a matter of fact, a general mucuyama who I just talked about.
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000 When I talked to, when I asked him about drafty, he said,
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000 I didn't even know who was a drafty and who was a life.
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000 I couldn't tell the difference.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000 And Colonel Hacord, Throden, his book, he wrote,
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000 I love the drafties because they were straight shooters.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000 They didn't, when they weren't trying to protect their career,
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000 they tell you what they thought.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000 And you could take their input and you could do something good with it.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000 I've said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000 The soldiers I served with and three different wars got better.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000 And they were all drafties.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000 I mean, I didn't never serve with an all volunteer outfit.
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000 They were all, no matter where I was, they were drafties.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000 And they all did their job.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000 I mean, I've never had anybody tell me when their job,
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000 it wasn't this one, but they wanted to do.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000 They just did it.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000 And I don't know if that's leadership or I don't,
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000 but just, if just the way it was.
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000 And they were all proud to be in our outfit.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000 I mean, now, I'm sure other people later on.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000 I mean, I've heard of people later on in Vietnam,
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000 having no problem with drugs.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000 And all I can, we didn't have any of that.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000 Now, fortunately, I left in 1967.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000 So I'm not sure, things got worse perhaps.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.000 But I think drugs, we are an issue period.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000 But I don't know.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000 I didn't have any of that kind of a problem.
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000 And as I said earlier, I'm not naive.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000 I believe in knowing exactly what's going on.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000 What you find out is walk around and talk to people.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000 You don't sit in your tents or in your helicopter.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000 You've got to go and talk to the guy on the ground
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000 and find out what tail's going on.
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000 And that's what, you know, there's a fellow wrote a book.
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000 His name was Peters.
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000 There's many years later.
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000 And he wrote the book.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000 It's called Management by Walking Around.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000 And there's a guy made a fortune just doing what I used to do.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000 I mean, it's scary.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000 But I mean, it's true.
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000 That's what leadership was all about.
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000 It's fine out what's going on.
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000 And then, using some common sense to tell people,
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000 this is what you're supposed to do or give them some guidance.
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000 But, I mean, people who used to tell me,
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000 well, you know how to do things because you can order
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000 with people to do things.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000 And I'm saying, let me tell you something.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000 Or learn a guide.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000 You get out of a tent to fix the track
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000 when somebody's shooting at you.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000 It's not anybody who goes on to just do it.
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000 He's going to do it because he knows if you don't get the track fix.
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000 We're going to get our ass killed.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000 I mean, we're going to get going.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000 He's going to do it because that's his job.
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000 And that may be leadership, but I'll tell you.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000 It's discipline that comes from people being trained right and taught right and treated right.
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000 If you don't treat people right, they deserve to treat you wrong.
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.000 And I'm a great believer in treating people the right way.
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000 I'm just from here and you talk about treating people the right way and listening to people.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000 You're, you know, you say when I told people to do stuff they did it.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Well, yeah, that's because you treated them well.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000 You listen to them.
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000 You have those relationships with your, with your troops.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000 And that's what makes people like you said,
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000 when you've got to have somebody that's going to go out and fix track
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000 under fire, well, that's somebody that's not going to do that just because you order to do it.
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000 You better have some some relationships.
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000 You better have treated them well.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000 And they must understand what the why on the mission is to like,
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000 hey, why this is important.
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000 So when you, when you look back at World War Two,
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000 Korea, Vietnam, I was from a tactical perspective,
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000 actually maneuvering troops.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000 Is there any big lessons that you would think back of that you say,
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000 this is something that I did consistently or this is something that I would never do because I knew it would cause problems?
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000 Hmm.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000 I can't think of anything.
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000 I'll go back to what I said earlier.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000 I've always believed.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000 It may be this from growing up in Iowa.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000 I don't know. Just treat people like you'd like to be treated yourself.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000 And it worked out.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000 I don't know.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000 I told you about my first sergeant,
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000 called me Fifi, which pissed me off right frankly.
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.000 But because he was a guy who didn't treat people like people like to be treated.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000 And I always was amazed how much I exalted in the fact when he got busted.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.000 I mean, we were in England on the way over to the continent.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000 He got busted for, I don't know what reason,
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000 but he got busted back to me, being a private.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000 That's a big jump from first sergeant down to me and a private.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000 And I was happy.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000 Because I didn't think this guy was, he's also the guy when I took a test
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000 to see what I could be smart enough to go to the military academy.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000 What the hell are you taking a test for like that for?
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000 You're not smart enough to go to the West Point.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000 And I always would like to be able to say to this guy, if I ever saw him again,
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000 I'm sure he's dead by now.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000 I told you so.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:16.000 But if you don't treat people like, they should be treated.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:22.000 You deserve to be treated to the opposite way.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000 And I just always tried to practice that anyway.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000 And so far it's been relatively successful.
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000 That's a huge underpinning of leadership from everything I've seen.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000 Everything I've ever read, every person I've ever talked to.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000 If you care about your people, you care about and you want to treat them well as human beings.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000 That's the underpinning that really makes leadership work.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000 And it's a lot of times, and you mentioned this earlier, a lot of times from the civilian side,
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000 they think, well, in the military, you can just order people to do things and they'll just do it because you're the boss.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000 And that's not true.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000 And it's actually when I got out of the military and I started working this civilian sector,
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000 I thought to myself, well, if you didn't want, if you want somebody to do something and they don't do it, you can just fire.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000 But that's not true either because guess what? You'll run out of people really quick.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000 And so what you have to do is you have to lead.
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000 So you have to do it.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000 And one of those, the most core underpinnings of leadership is really caring about the people that work for you.
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:35.000 And I think the more you care about them and I know for me, I cared more about my guys than I did about myself.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000 And I wanted to make sure that they were okay and that things were going to go well for them.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000 And that was always my priority, my real priority.
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000 And I suppose someone that was very jaded might think, well, then you know, you're going to get passed over.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000 You're not.
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000 Things are going to work out good for you because you're more worried about your troops.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000 And the opposite's actually true.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:07.000 And my career was beautiful and all I ever tried to do is take care of the people that worked for me.
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000 Because that's the way you get to be successful.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:23.000 You know, hiring people or working with people, you know, in civilian sector, you hire people.
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000 And the military, whoever arrived was that that was it.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000 I get people.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000 But I've always said, your job is to make the boss successful.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000 And vice versa, the boss's job is to make them successful.
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000 And if you work that works out for both of you.
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.000 And to me, leadership, you know,
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000 we talk about it.
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000 But it's easy if you follow a few basic principles.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.000 You don't have to have all the stuff that goes, I mean, people write books on leadership.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000 You probably have written books on leadership yourself.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000 Well, yes indeed.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000 But the fact of that is there's some basics.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 And you just expand on it.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000 You don't.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000 It isn't that magic if you just follow a few basic principles.
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000 One of the things we talk about in the book actually is simple, not easy.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000 Yeah, because it is.
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000 And we say that in our book as well as we didn't invent any of this.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000 This is stuff that's been around.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000 And there's no eureka moments.
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000 And we're not claiming to have anything startlingly new.
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000 This is fundamental stuff that if you think about it.
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000 It's some of it might be stuff you already do as a leader.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000 Some of the stuff that you know you should do as a leader.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000 And just make it clear for people to understand is is probably the only real benefit of the book itself.
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000 Okay, this is good stuff.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000 Yeah.
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000 But nothing.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000 No rocket science there.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000 I didn't need to be a whisk.
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000 I can't promise you.
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000 So did you.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000 You mentioned earlier when we were not recording that you actually ended up going back.
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000 You actually ended up going back to Vietnam as and were you a civilian at that time?
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000 Oh yes, yes.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000 Well, my wife and I like to travel.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000 So we've traveled most of the places in the world by now.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000 And she wanted to go back and see where I'd been in Vietnam.
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000 And that's one too sure about that.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000 But anyway, we had this opportunity.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:57.000 And so we went back and I went to Hanhoy, which was an experience.
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000 And I go to the Hanhoy Hilton and seeing how they've turned that into a propaganda place.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:19.000 And I'm still remember seeing this picture on the wall of Senator McCain and a couple other guys I can't remember the names.
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000 Another one was what a high school class made a mine.
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000 But day by name, who was an Air Force retired Colonel.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000 He got to metal a boner.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000 But anyway, and they were shown them in these white pants and white over shirt is if they were on a barbecue.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:54.000 You know, everything you've heard about the place was just and they showed you some of the cages that they had people in.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.000 We actually have had two guests on the podcast that were in the Noilhilton.
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000 And one of them went back and was talking us through that same propaganda.
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000 Went back to the Noilhilton as a civilian.
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:18.000 And just the the feeling he had was pretty strong.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:30.000 I can't imagine. But you know, when I was there, I was just seen it from the propaganda and what they were.
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000 Because it's a big tourist attraction apparently for the the Vietnamese.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:47.000 And so we obviously saw it and the knew what it was and and for what it was.
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000 And I hear all kinds of stories about the people that were there, you know, but.
01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:02.000 And then we went from there to the name and then down to a side gone.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:13.000 And I'd hired a car and a guy to take us up back up to my own operational area.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:23.000 And drove through the mission of representation, which was sort of a fun experience to see.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:33.000 Now it's no longer mission that's stayed on. They took over obviously from their friends, but looks exactly the same.
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000 I mean trees are lined up, rubber trees just rubber trees, rubber trees.
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000 And the people are out there working the trees.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000 And I don't know if you know this, which is this is an aside.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000 You cannot burn a living rubber tree. It won't burn.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000 And I've tried hard.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.000 I mean, I have two flimps or I said, and we tried hard to burn those trees down on the sides of the road.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Doesn't work.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:19.000 And so anyway, we went back up to the old operation area in the same place.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000 I was pretty close to where I got wounded.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000 When I was in Vietnam, I was in my helicopter flying over this river.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000 And I was pretty close to where that happened.
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000 I could do that because I had to map coordinates of where I had been wounded before.
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000 Otherwise, I'd guarantee I'd never be able to recognize a place like Tom.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:53.000 But my old base camp, which was because I had helicopters over there, had airfield.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000 And now being turned into a strip mall.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.000 So I washed all that happening. But it was seen side gone again.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000 It was an amazing experience to see what they've done.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000 You see all these tall buildings now.
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:24.000 But the one officer's club that was on the roof of one of the hotels is still there.
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000 They're exhausted the same. And my wife and I went up and I had lunch there.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:38.000 And my time before I went out to the unit, I used to go up there.
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:51.000 And we'd go up there and watch out here and see the savers, not savers.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000 What do you call the rounds that are tracers? Tracers.
01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000 Thank you. See all the tracers from being fired up and up and back down.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:08.000 And you need to experience because you really weren't fighting the war.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000 You mean, in Saigon.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:17.000 You know, it was so different from there when you went out into the field.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000 So it was fun to go back and see what they've done.
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:33.000 And I was impressed with how much the south fit and the knees have really been serious about getting real business and going.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000 And a lot of things happening. Business was up north.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000 It's still a grand. It was still a grand at the time.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000 Very grand. You mean, very few tall buildings.
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000 Very few businesses. And so that you can identify.
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.000 And maybe it's still the same because that was 11 years ago now.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000 But I don't know what's changed over there.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000 But so the north fit in me's one the war sort of speak.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000 I say that with tongue and cheek actually.
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000 But they won the war.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000 But I'm not sure that the south feet and the knees aren't coming back and taking over running the country.
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000 They certainly have the financial strength there.
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000 And I hope that's a way that eventually will work out.
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000 Well, the way the rest of the world's gone.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000 It's been freedom and democracy and capital.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000 It's eventually wins the long war.
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.000 Yeah.
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000 And we've seen that worldwide. So hopefully it'll happen for them as well.
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000 How did you get wounded?
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000 You're third time getting wounded and Vietnam?
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000 Well, I was one of the missions we had ever evening.
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000 We'd go into a perimeter.
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000 And most of the time we'd be in a perimeter around our children unit.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000 So they could fire at night without worrying about getting over a run.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:11.000 And so I put all of our unit into its perimeter from my helicopter flying around.
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:22.000 And I noticed a bunch of sand pans evacuating here in the we had.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000 So I thought in my John Wayne family,
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000 I'm going to go now and shoot some of these guys.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000 So I got to pilot.
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000 I was flying in this case in a two passenger.
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000 I mean, one passenger.
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000 Bubble helicopter.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000 And anyway, so I had this M40.
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000 You know what an M40 is?
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000 It's fires. It looks like a shotgun.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000 So I'm up there.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000 And I'm shooting at these guys in the same pan.
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:06.000 And I'm doing pretty good, missing a lot, but in any of some.
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000 One of them shot back.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000 And my God hit me.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000 In the leg.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000 And so I told the driver about taking me back down to the headquarters,
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000 which was what the squad and surgery was.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000 He, I was never forget. He took my pants away.
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000 And there was blood spurry right out all the way out,
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000 at least 18 inches from my leg.
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000 I hit something they call as further.
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000 And he said, this is a captain speaking to me.
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000 Colonel, you got damn dumb son of a bitch.
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000 You could be dead.
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000 So anyway, he managed me up.
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000 And the metal's still there.
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000 Still in my leg.
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000 But you were, you were turned to duty though, right?
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000 Oh yeah. I mean, I had been in command more than 30 days.
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000 I was scared of death.
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000 I couldn't be evacuated.
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000 Hell, I had finished out my tour.
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000 I mean, so.
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000 One of my friends named Tim Kennedy is a green barray.
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000 And he has a TV show coming out called Hard to Kill.
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000 I think maybe we need to get you on that show.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000 No, no.
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000 No, somebody might take me up on it.
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000 I mean, I, I, I've been fortunate.
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000 I mean, a lot of people got hurt.
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000 A lot more seriously and I've been.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000 And I've seen some.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000 In fact, I've had too many hurt pretty seriously.
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000 I had one of my.
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000 My.
01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.000 Exile was in the helicopter and got shot.
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000 Up to the seat of the helicopter and all the strap and everything.
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000 What right into his leg and he was.
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000 Forever.
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000 In bad shape.
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000 I mean, I mean, so I've seen a lot of people
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000 get hurt pretty badly.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000 I've been, I've been fortunate.
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000 I mean.
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000 But I'm also had the attitude.
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000 I'm not going to get shot and killed.
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000 I mean.
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000 No, that's worked out.
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000 But.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000 Going back to.
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000 You know, when I got out of that tank to go back in Korea.
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000 I had no more idea that I was going to kill.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000 That wasn't going to enter into my mind.
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000 I just had something to do.
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000 And.
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000 That may be foolish.
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000 But it's just the way it was.
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000 Yeah, I think if you're.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000 If you were thinking about.
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000 What could happen?
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000 You wouldn't do anything.
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000 You couldn't do anything.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000 You went right.
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000 Yeah.
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000 So you're.
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000 You wrap up your squadron commander and Vietnam.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000 And again, I mean, you were taking.
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000 How often would you guys you're getting in fire fights a lot?
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000 What was your what was your cash rate of casualties like?
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000 How many guys did you lose how many people were killed while you were there as a squadron commander?
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000 How many were killed?
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000 Probably can.
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000 Not too many.
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000 I mean.
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000 When you have a.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000 A calves.
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000 Do you know what a knee calf is?
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000 That's a personnel carrier.
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000 I mean, a calf stands for armored cavalry assault vehicle.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000 But it's.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000 It was M1 13's.
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000 That can those days.
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000 I don't know.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000 I don't know what they're called.
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000 We still used M1 13's.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000 We used M1 13's in Ramadi.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000 The same exact.
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000 So we we are very familiar.
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000 We both read in the back of them.
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000 Well, they're pretty well protected.
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000 And the tanks are we have patent tanks and they're protected.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000 So yeah, we had casualties because.
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000 And in a cavalry troop.
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000 We have infantry right in the AKS.
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000 So when they get out.
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000 But I don't know that statistics.
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000 I wrote enough letters.
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000 But not very.
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000 I mean, one is more than enough.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000 But.
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000 I don't remember how many I wrote.
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000 But because I did that for everybody was killed.
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000 But I don't.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000 I don't know the statistics.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000 Not too many not overborn burdened.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000 I mean, in the sense it.
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000 I got several people's names on the wall.
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000 I go there every year.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000 Just just stand there.
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000 But I don't know.
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000 Jack, I don't know the answer.
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000 I understand sir.
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000 When you got home from Vietnam, you know,
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000 you talked about coming home from Korea and everyone's in uniform.
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000 And, you know, we hear stories of guys coming home from Vietnam.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000 And they literally get told, don't wear you uniform around.
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000 How different was the reception from World War II,
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000 to Vietnam?
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:12.000 Well, coming back from Vietnam was a sad experience.
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000 We thought we'd been doing a good job.
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000 We thought we'd been doing the right job.
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.000 And I came back to the Pentagon.
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:39.000 I sort of witnessed the experience of the country being up on arms about Vietnam.
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:46.000 So, I didn't feel too appreciated, I guess, as the right word.
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:54.000 And yet, I didn't feel like I'd been doing a good job.
01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000 So, I didn't have any bad feelings.
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000 Most of those feelings about what was going on came after I got out.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:24.000 So, I retired in 69 and things began to go to hell in the country about what we were doing over there.
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000 Well, right after I got out, I guess.
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:36.000 My job when I got out, I mean, when I came home was,
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000 I was in the second tier of defense at this level.
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:48.000 I told you earlier, the Army sent me to school to learn to contact the Wizkis.
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000 Well, guess what?
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000 When I came back, Army sent me to be a Wizkid.
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000 I was a stand-up to the second tier of the general staff,
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000 Alan Antoven's organization, which was called Systems Analysis.
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000 And that's for all the Wizkis were.
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000 And they had a representative of the Army Navy Air Force Brinkore, all four of us.
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000 And we were sure of the other energy that Tito taught were.
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000 We were, we were supposed to balance some of these smart young men that were the,
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000 the, quote, Wizkis. And as I've told people, I've never wiser a kid,
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000 but I was in that organization.
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000 And it was an experience.
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000 They wouldn't let me work on anything Army.
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000 And I had, because they knew I had to go back to the Army.
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:55.000 See, that was, and you had to be sitting there making decisions that could be against the Army.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000 What the Army wanted to be as opposed.
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:07.000 One of the things I was involved with, because I was involved with the Navy in the Air Force,
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000 the Navy wanted to build another nuclear submarine.
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:21.000 Well, it's only so many capital ships that was by law.
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.000 And so they'd be, I asked why there was, I can't remember.
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000 And I think 13 capital ships, so what over the number was?
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000 I asked, why is that number 13?
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000 It took quite a while for them to figure out the answer.
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000 And it really was very simple.
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:48.000 We've gone back to the League of Nations, probably in Tito's, I mean, in 1920 to something.
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000 When they, they've partly doubted to the various World War of One winners,
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000 the number of capital ships.
01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000 I called battleships.
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000 Numbers of ships that each country would have.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000 And that's where the, this number came from.
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:17.000 Well, I, that was just, uh, now, I learned to ask that question,
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000 because when I was going to Michigan, one of, one of the professors said,
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000 this was in statistics class.
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000 I want to know what, you want to, what, not what the results are.
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000 I want to know what the assumptions are.
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000 And so I was asking this assumption, why is there,
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000 X number of capital ships?
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000 It was a simple question.
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000 I, I didn't know I was creating a challenge.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000 I mean, it, it turned out to be exactly what I was saying.
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000 It was a strange phenomenon for the,
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000 the time to try to figure out why that number.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000 I don't know what the world is now, but I can tell you, at that point,
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000 this was the 1968, I guess.
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:15.000 It was a question that they took a wild answer.
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000 By the way, I don't know how many capital ships we have.
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000 I don't know what they're called today, but we have a lot more than I think we had
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000 back in those days.
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000 So what made you decide to retire?
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000 Well, I had 25 years in the military.
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000 And I decided I wanted to think about doing something else.
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.000 Part of it was, I used to listen to people, tell me,
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000 you just order people to do things they do it.
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000 So that's, there's a lot of bologna.
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000 So I wanted to go and see, got my,
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.000 if you would, teeth on, try and something in civilian work world.
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000 So I started a bunch of resumes out,
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:19.000 I eventually, was hired to go down to Texas.
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000 And, fellow that hired me was retired,
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000 maybe a reader.
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000 By the way, as an aside, I was assigned to the first squadron,
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000 I think it's called, that flew jets off of aircraft carriers.
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000 Got my name in Felix, to Blonsky.
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000 It was a wonderful man.
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000 But if you wanted to know what time it was,
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000 he'd tell you how to build the watch.
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:10.000 He hired me and our job there was to figure out how to use
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000 from LTV's computer resources,
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000 how to use these in civilian application.
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:30.000 And, one of the things we did was we developed
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:37.000 for Dallas, exes and owes that they used to do on the
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000 job board on the computer screen.
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.000 It just became a way that apparently,
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000 Dallas cobblestone would teach a guy's how to react
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000 to whatever police it was.
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000 So, that was using some of this fancy technology
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000 that LTV had to build something that was
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000 applicable in civilian life.
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:13.000 Well, the length of LTV, the length, the tip of what?
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000 It's only got challenged because he was creating a huge empire
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.000 and the anti-trust people got after him.
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000 And all of a sudden, our arm was part that I was in,
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000 was one for 30 people to four.
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000 And I was one of the four.
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000 And I don't know to this day, I still don't know why they can't.
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000 I just been there less than a year.
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:47.000 But the guy who tried to hire me into computer sciences
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:53.000 previously, offered me a job with computer sciences.
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000 Even though I had a job, I knew that this place was not a
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000 place that long-term could be.
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000 So, I went to work for computer sciences,
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000 and there's been 15 years there.
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000 And it returned from there.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000 It's one of the presidents, one of their divisions.
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.000 And one of the things that my bosses used to say,
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000 I was one of the few leaders they had.
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.000 But a lot of managers, but I was leading a group.
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000 And we came very successful.
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000 Much more so that I ever imagined we could be.
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000 It was primarily in sales and marketing.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000 And I had a boss that said, who was from my B.M.
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000 and strict IBM suit kind of guy.
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000 You know, you've heard all stories about him.
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000 And he said, he said, if I were to go back to my comrades that I
02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000 B.M. and tell them that I just hired the former Army Colonel
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000 to be at a sales, they'd all think I was God damn crazy.
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000 And so, anyway, I had a great career at computer sciences.
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000 And as I said, I retired from there.
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000 And I'm not a typist.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000 When I was going to high school, if you took typing,
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000 you weren't going to college.
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000 It was back.
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000 So this thing called voicemail appeared to me.
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000 And I said, so another fill on I started a company
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000 in the voicemail business, 1984.
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000 And it was pretty successful.
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000 And we sold it in 1998.
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000 And I stopped working since then.
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:04.000 Well, that is awesome.
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000 And I know we've kept you here for a couple hours now.
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000 And probably a good place to at least stop for this particular session.
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000 Is there anything else you want to say anything else you want to close out with?
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000 Well, I can say this.
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:24.000 I met my wife on my first assignment from the Pentagon.
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000 And my job in the Pentagon, among other things, was to control the number of
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000 troops on the ground in Vietnam.
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000 Congress mandated that we 550,000 people on the ground.
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000 My job was to be sure that that number was met.
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000 So when the Secretary of Defense went to Fort Congress, he could always say
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000 that we have never purchased.
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000 So on a quarterly basis, I would go to Hawaii.
02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.000 And people from Hawaii, Thailand, Korea, Philippines, and Hawaii would all meet
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000 at the headquarters in the Hill.
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000 And we'd go over, because when Westmore and a lot to replace an
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.000 ACAC at Batai and whether it's infantry Batai and different numbers and everything is different.
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:26.000 So we had to do all this monitoring and keeping track of how many troops we had.
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000 My wife was a schoolteach in California, and she was over their own
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000 vacation.
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000 And one of my former colleagues from Vietnam, she knew him.
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000 And some of them were met.
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000 In the next two years, we dated cross country.
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000 She didn't California meet in the Pentagon.
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000 And I would go every quarter to the Hawaii and I was for this meeting.
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000 I'm telling you about.
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000 So I plan the meeting to be started on Tuesday.
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000 So I could fly from here to California.
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000 I spend some time with her.
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000 Then I fly off to Hawaii and I was.
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000 And then on the way back, I'd stop until the same thing.
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000 Then it'd be up back here.
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:24.000 So anyway, we got married in 19, after I got out retired in 69.
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000 And we got married in October, 69.
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000 And the reason I was still living today is because of her.
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000 She keeps me alive.
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000 She keeps carrying me.
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000 So she's the principal reason that I can sit here and talk to you.
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000 Well, then we'll say thank you to you for coming on.
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000 And we'll say thank you to your wife for getting you here.
02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000 Because sir, once again, this has just been an absolute honor to be able to talk to you.
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000 To be able to hear the stories and the lessons that you learned and thank you.
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000 Well, from all of us for your service, your sacrifice.
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000 And it's been an honor.
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000 Well, you all deserve the honor.
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:25.000 I mean, you guys, I don't know what it would be like to be in the service today.
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000 Frankly, I see these guys.
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:42.000 My nephew deployed six times twice to Iraq once for the Somali extraction.
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:48.000 Plus three other times, he just deployed you know.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:56.000 Now, how he did this, I'll never know, but he never left Camp Pendleton.
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:04.000 I mean, he did, he was a drill sergeant down at MCRD.
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000 But he could move back to Pendleton.
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000 I mean, his wife lived there the whole time.
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000 He's 20 years in the Marine Corps.
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000 All the same.
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000 I never figured that out.
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.000 I moved around like, but my wife would tell you.
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000 She, she and I got married after I got her.
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000 We're in our 17th house.
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000 We've only been married for him almost 49 years.
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000 I mean, so everybody said, well, you were in the military.
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000 We didn't do this.
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000 She was never in the military.
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000 We moved all the time since then.
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000 I mean, you stay in San Diego.
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000 I'll do my best.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000 I'll do my best.
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000 And again, yeah, absolutely the troops that are out there today.
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000 And there's a lot of troops that listen to this.
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000 Guys out there holding the line and doing those deployments over and over again.
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:09.000 But, you know, the work that we do today is based on the lessons that we learn from your generations from the three wars that you fought.
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000 And what you passed on to us, and it was an honor for us to continue to carry the flag.
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000 So thank you.
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000 Thank you.
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000 Keep carrying it.
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000 Yes, sir.
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000 And Colonel Tom Fife has departed.
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.000 And obviously it is an honor to get to talk to him.
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000 And thanks for setting that up, Dave.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000 Yeah, man, that was awesome.
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000 Much appreciated three war veteran.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000 I mean, come on.
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000 Come on.
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000 That's just unbelievably awesome to sit and listen to.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000 And you know what?
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000 Thanks, Dave for setting that up.
02:07:47.000 --> 02:08:02.000 And also thanks to everyone that that supports this podcast so that we have the opportunity to bring people on like Colonel Tom Fife and be able to share those lessons on which there was a ton in there.
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000 So thank you all for supporting and echo.
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000 If people do want to support.
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000 Sure.
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000 Can you maybe feel something on how to do that?
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000 Sure.
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000 Let me start with our company.
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000 Oh, origin.
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000 That's the company.
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000 Origin main.com is the website.
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000 There you can get.
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000 Jocquad is supplement.
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000 You can get Jocquad supplements.
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.000 Jocquad super krill oil for your joints.
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000 Joint warfare for your joints don't run out by the way.
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000 Dave Burke.
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:44.000 You're I don't know if you've been on the in the situation of running out of super krill when you depend on super krill.
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000 That's a bad situation.
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000 And if you ever want to reduce the risk of running out do the subscriptions.
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000 That's what I do.
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000 Kind of subscription subscription.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000 You just get your allotted amount per month or however often you need it.
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000 Also pre-mission supplement.
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000 It's called discipline.
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000 Hold on Dave, you're firing up on discipline.
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000 You said you said to me and I quote, I live on discipline.
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000 Yeah, it has become a daily part of my life for sure.
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000 You've got it in the brain.
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000 Yep.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000 You use it before you work.
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000 Yep.
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000 You're studying your work and you're prepping.
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000 That's your go to.
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000 The stuff is awesome.
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000 I use it probably more than I should.
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000 Yeah.
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000 It's a joke.
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000 I don't know if there's a some kind of a, you know, limitation health wise.
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000 Like if you're drinking nine gallons a day.
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000 I'm going to make gallons.
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000 I'll let you know.
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000 Yeah.
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000 Yeah.
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000 Check.
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000 All right.
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000 Well, there it is.
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000 It's a great, everything.
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000 Pre-mission.
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000 Pre-workout.
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000 Pre-testing.
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000 Pre-juditsu.
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000 Now you're going to get mad or whatever or you're going to make, you give me your attitude.
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000 Because you know, you make fun of me because I want to get to taste good.
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000 Yeah.
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000 You make fun of me.
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000 Yeah.
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000 And there's not even that much I can say about that because it's a legitimate thing.
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000 For me, be jocled to be like, I want it to taste good.
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000 It's kind of a weakness, right?
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000 It's kind of soft.
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000 Right.
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000 Well, that being said, we have another flavor coming.
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000 I'm going to tell you what.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000 Well, first of all, it's a two-thicks.
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000 First of all, it tastes good.
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000 Yeah.
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000 I know, best.
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:30.000 Second of all, it's, it's, it's basically peanut collagan.
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000 But I can't call it that.
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000 And that's like, I can't do that.
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000 Yeah.
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000 I can't do that.
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000 So it's going to be called the coconut pineapple.
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000 Sure.
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000 Just straight peanut collagan.
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000 Because I just can't.
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000 No, no.
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000 This is not, that's not how.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000 Yeah.
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000 No, that's not how.
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000 Yeah.
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000 You did mention that.
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000 And I'm impressed that you're sticking with the delicious, luxurious, tasty, really good.
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000 But that's one of those things.
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000 Like, you like peanut collagan.
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000 You like that flavor.
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000 Like, I've heard of people not really liking it.
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000 But that could have to do with the fact that you know how like when you drink
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000 alcohol too much.
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000 And it has like a, like, to kill a little habit.
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000 You know, you know, if you just drink too many of them, you get drunk.
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000 Yeah.
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000 It's very, very.
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000 Now you can never drink it again.
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000 No, if you smell it, you feel off.
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000 You know, I think it's a killer right now.
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000 To kill it is like that.
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000 That's for sure.
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000 You agree with it.
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000 Yeah, yeah.
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000 I don't agree with it.
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000 During my younger years, I had like a 14 month hiatus from the egg.
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000 After I had a, that's it.
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000 Yeah, that's it.
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000 Yeah, that's it.
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000 Yeah, that's what peanut collagan is.
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000 That's what I'm doing.
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000 That's what I'm doing.
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000 That's what I'm doing.
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000 You know what, young stupid and motivated.
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000 Yeah.
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000 Like you know, you're actually motivated to go over to do this.
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000 That's a bad.
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000 Sure.
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000 Dumb.
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.000 Yeah.
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:49.000 But if you haven't had that experience with peanut collagan, I would assume that that's a, that's a pretty high rate of acceptance as far as deliciousness goes in my opinion.
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000 Or in my, by my estimation, I think my hypothesis or whatever.
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000 Nonetheless, it's called disciplines.
02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000 Pre-mission this, whether you love peanut collagan or love lemon lime,
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000 ish flavor with other delicious factors in it.
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000 That's a good thing, but it's good because it makes your brain more healthy.
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000 And your body, pre-mission pre-workout, pre-test, taking pre-meeting, pre-judicatory,
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000 workout, cognitive, and physical force multiplier.
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000 That's what that is.
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.000 So get on now and of course, also, Giz and rashguards, Dave Burke.
02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000 You need to talk about milk.
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000 Yeah.
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000 You missed the milk.
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000 Yeah.
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000 I didn't really miss it. I was going to save it for last, but not at all.
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000 Okay.
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000 I'll get on. I'll get back in my lane over here.
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000 No, because I just had a whole thing I was going to do with it.
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000 Raskar, it's telling me about it.
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000 I feel like we should do the milk now, because you've got kind of kind of
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000 brought it up, which is, you know, if for lack of a better term,
02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000 it's actually, it is a better term.
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000 It's not protein part.
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000 It's protein powder, but it's a better term for this particular protein powder.
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000 Moke.
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000 Yeah.
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000 Mint chocolate.
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000 Just kissy.
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000 The dog is the Crimean.
02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000 You're still in the milk?
02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:58.000 Yeah.
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000 He's not the milk, and he just told me he's going to get it this week.
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000 Well, I will say this.
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000 I never was into protein powder.
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000 Aside from, you're still in my school.
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000 You're still not.
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000 I'm still...
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000 You went to milk.
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000 Red, correct, correct.
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000 But, this one is one of those good ones where kind of like you in the discipline
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000 where you're like pounding at all the time.
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000 So, I give my daughter Dzerk, right.
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000 Oh, yeah.
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000 This is a dessert.
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000 Straight up straight up?
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000 Yeah.
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000 It tastes that good.
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.68 I'll put a couple of drops of it in there.
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:27.52 Try to do that.
02:13:27.52 --> 02:13:31.12 But two drops of vanilla put an egg and put it in the blender.
02:13:31.12 --> 02:13:32.64 They're swear to me.
02:13:32.64 --> 02:13:34.04 In fact, you know what, don't do it.
02:13:34.04 --> 02:13:34.88 Don't do it.
02:13:34.88 --> 02:13:36.12 You'll do it in the same boat as me.
02:13:36.12 --> 02:13:37.76 That's when the last is like a dessert.
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:39.64 And there's protein, not it's good, man.
02:13:39.64 --> 02:13:42.28 Because I used to make these milk shakes when I was young.
02:13:42.28 --> 02:13:43.64 Like, I just homemade milk shake.
02:13:43.64 --> 02:13:45.000 You more swallow.
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000 Probably.
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.80 Probably.
02:13:47.80 --> 02:13:49.000 Victor.
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.24 And the last thing used to make these milk shakes when I was young,
02:13:51.24 --> 02:13:57.24 they were, they had vanilla, egg, like a teeny tiny piece of banana, milk.
02:14:00.84 --> 02:14:03.24 And some other stuff, some sugar in there.
02:14:03.24 --> 02:14:04.08 And it was good.
02:14:04.08 --> 02:14:05.48 It was like a solid milk shake.
02:14:05.48 --> 02:14:06.20 Like good.
02:14:06.20 --> 02:14:08.08 Like almost like you bled it from a gourmet spot.
02:14:08.08 --> 02:14:11.08 Well, the milk is no joke when it comes to milk shake simulator.
02:14:11.08 --> 02:14:11.92 Yeah.
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:13.76 Mint, mint chocolate.
02:14:13.76 --> 02:14:14.92 Your favorite peanut butter is coming.
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:15.92 Peanut butter is chocolate.
02:14:15.92 --> 02:14:17.60 Chocolate peanut butter is coming.
02:14:17.60 --> 02:14:20.48 Chocolate peanut butter, milk is on its way.
02:14:20.48 --> 02:14:22.88 Straight up, deep brick when you get on it, you're going to stand that.
02:14:22.88 --> 02:14:25.84 So you're just going to be pounding discipline and milk all day.
02:14:25.84 --> 02:14:27.12 The way they break.
02:14:27.12 --> 02:14:28.12 Only days break.
02:14:28.12 --> 02:14:29.12 Like an echo.
02:14:29.12 --> 02:14:30.12 Easy to look like echo Charles.
02:14:30.12 --> 02:14:31.12 Yeah.
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:32.12 So all in.
02:14:32.12 --> 02:14:33.12 Six months, dude.
02:14:33.12 --> 02:14:34.12 Lift the engine to milk.
02:14:34.12 --> 02:14:35.12 All that stuff.
02:14:35.12 --> 02:14:37.76 Also, geese and rash guards.
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:38.76 We can talk about that.
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:42.12 If you want, unless you have another suggestion on what else I should talk about.
02:14:42.12 --> 02:14:45.12 I'm saying, I want to do the right thing over here.
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:46.40 No, I'm saying, Dave Burke.
02:14:46.40 --> 02:14:47.96 Kind of give you a good day for work.
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:48.96 You do get your right.
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:49.96 I do.
02:14:49.96 --> 02:14:53.56 So the one good thing about starting geogitsi with 45.
02:14:53.56 --> 02:14:59.20 I discovered the one good thing about it and said starting at 15 is I never have any
02:14:59.20 --> 02:15:03.12 of those stories where I tell about how uncomfortable the gear is or how the rash guards
02:15:03.12 --> 02:15:04.12 get me.
02:15:04.12 --> 02:15:05.92 You know, or the geese are hard to wash.
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:08.88 I got origin maingees time to from the geogitsi.
02:15:08.88 --> 02:15:10.24 From the get going out of the geogitsi.
02:15:10.24 --> 02:15:14.28 There's like someone that never had a flip phone in 1994.
02:15:14.28 --> 02:15:16.000 Just woke up and they had an iPhone 6.
02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000 Starting with the iPhone 10.
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000 Yeah.
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000 You're just out of the geogitsi.
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.12 I don't know what it's like to have grown up with all that terrible gear you guys
02:15:23.12 --> 02:15:24.12 use.
02:15:24.12 --> 02:15:26.12 You know what it was like in the day.
02:15:26.12 --> 02:15:27.12 Yeah.
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:28.12 Yeah.
02:15:28.12 --> 02:15:34.64 Well, that's actually good news in my opinion, you know, because working, not working,
02:15:34.64 --> 02:15:40.28 but working out and doing you just in a junkie, rather first gear head, man.
02:15:40.28 --> 02:15:44.20 You know, like you ever, when you buy your first suit, same deal.
02:15:44.20 --> 02:15:45.20 Like you don't know.
02:15:45.20 --> 02:15:46.20 I don't know.
02:15:46.20 --> 02:15:47.20 I don't know.
02:15:47.20 --> 02:15:48.20 Just like that.
02:15:48.20 --> 02:15:49.20 Like, oh, I see go to the school.
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:50.20 I'll even go buy one.
02:15:50.20 --> 02:15:51.20 I don't know.
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:52.20 Whatever.
02:15:52.20 --> 02:15:52.20 So same thing.
02:15:52.20 --> 02:15:54.20 So I went and bought a gear and it was like, I bought a cheap one.
02:15:54.20 --> 02:15:55.20 Yeah.
02:15:55.20 --> 02:15:56.20 40 bucks.
02:15:56.20 --> 02:15:57.20 No, no straight.
02:15:57.20 --> 02:15:59.20 See, I bought my first gear was in a key.
02:15:59.20 --> 02:16:01.20 I bought from the Akito store.
02:16:01.20 --> 02:16:02.20 Yeah.
02:16:02.20 --> 02:16:04.20 Because the geogitsi place, they were like a 200 bucks.
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:06.20 I'm like, oh, go, not happening.
02:16:06.20 --> 02:16:07.20 I've a find a different one.
02:16:07.20 --> 02:16:08.20 Yeah.
02:16:08.20 --> 02:16:09.20 I found this cheap one.
02:16:09.20 --> 02:16:10.20 On bleached.
02:16:10.20 --> 02:16:11.20 Have you ever heard of this?
02:16:11.20 --> 02:16:12.20 Unbleached cotton.
02:16:12.20 --> 02:16:14.20 That was even cheaper in the bleached cotton.
02:16:14.20 --> 02:16:15.20 It's an off-white.
02:16:15.20 --> 02:16:16.20 Yeah.
02:16:16.20 --> 02:16:17.20 It feels like it's filled with steel wool.
02:16:17.20 --> 02:16:18.20 Scratching it in your skin.
02:16:18.20 --> 02:16:19.20 Yeah.
02:16:19.20 --> 02:16:20.20 But that's hard.
02:16:20.20 --> 02:16:23.20 And it lasted like four weeks.
02:16:23.20 --> 02:16:24.20 So yeah, get a quality gear.
02:16:24.20 --> 02:16:26.20 It's a bit more ginkae.
02:16:26.20 --> 02:16:27.20 That was a key to the key.
02:16:27.20 --> 02:16:28.20 It was an Akito gear.
02:16:28.20 --> 02:16:29.20 It looked.
02:16:29.20 --> 02:16:36.20 It felt similar from the external viewpoint to a jitter ge.
02:16:36.20 --> 02:16:37.20 But it wasn't.
02:16:37.20 --> 02:16:41.20 And it damn sure wasn't made in America.
02:16:41.20 --> 02:16:42.20 Made in Maine.
02:16:42.20 --> 02:16:46.20 You know what's awesome is to know to literally know the people.
02:16:46.20 --> 02:16:49.20 Because we've been in the factory.
02:16:49.20 --> 02:16:51.20 I know the people that made those.
02:16:51.20 --> 02:16:52.20 I know them.
02:16:52.20 --> 02:16:53.20 Yeah.
02:16:53.20 --> 02:16:54.20 I like I say, oh, hey, how you doing?
02:16:54.20 --> 02:16:56.20 Oh, I'm over here making a geek.
02:16:56.20 --> 02:16:56.20 Yeah.
02:16:56.20 --> 02:16:57.20 That's real.
02:16:57.20 --> 02:16:58.20 That's what's happening.
02:16:58.20 --> 02:16:59.20 Yeah.
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:01.20 And on top of that, that's mentioned.
02:17:01.20 --> 02:17:02.20 The cotton.
02:17:02.20 --> 02:17:04.20 That was loomed right there in the building.
02:17:04.20 --> 02:17:05.20 That's right.
02:17:05.20 --> 02:17:06.20 It's from America too.
02:17:06.20 --> 02:17:07.20 That's something.
02:17:07.20 --> 02:17:09.20 And you said, I was talking about peed about this.
02:17:09.20 --> 02:17:10.20 The cotton.
02:17:10.20 --> 02:17:12.20 It's not all cotton.
02:17:12.20 --> 02:17:13.20 It's.
02:17:13.20 --> 02:17:14.20 What is it?
02:17:14.20 --> 02:17:15.20 Poly.
02:17:15.20 --> 02:17:17.20 So it's a poly cotton blend.
02:17:17.20 --> 02:17:20.20 And I thought that the two strands were different.
02:17:20.20 --> 02:17:22.20 And it's woven together.
02:17:22.20 --> 02:17:27.20 No, they make that that actual thread is cotton.
02:17:27.20 --> 02:17:28.20 Poly cotton.
02:17:28.20 --> 02:17:35.20 The thread itself that you weave is that's why that's why you can put it in the dryer to dry like a normal piece of clothing.
02:17:35.20 --> 02:17:36.20 Not four hours.
02:17:36.20 --> 02:17:39.20 You pull it out and you stuff the hang it up because it's all cotton.
02:17:39.20 --> 02:17:41.20 It just holds on to the water.
02:17:41.20 --> 02:17:42.20 It gets out of there.
02:17:42.20 --> 02:17:43.20 Yeah.
02:17:43.20 --> 02:17:44.20 Made in America.
02:17:44.20 --> 02:17:45.20 So yeah.
02:17:45.20 --> 02:17:46.20 You.
02:17:46.20 --> 02:17:47.20 Good.
02:17:47.20 --> 02:17:48.20 Good.
02:17:48.20 --> 02:17:49.20 Dave Burke.
02:17:49.20 --> 02:17:50.20 Boom.
02:17:50.20 --> 02:17:52.20 Origin.
02:17:52.20 --> 02:17:53.20 Geey.
02:17:53.20 --> 02:17:56.20 No history of discomfort in other geese.
02:17:56.20 --> 02:17:57.20 No.
02:17:57.20 --> 02:17:58.20 No.
02:17:58.20 --> 02:17:59.20 Stinky.
02:17:59.20 --> 02:18:00.20 Area of the house.
02:18:00.20 --> 02:18:02.20 Where wet geese are hanging up for four days.
02:18:02.20 --> 02:18:03.20 Yep.
02:18:03.20 --> 02:18:04.20 Yeah.
02:18:04.20 --> 02:18:06.20 And I'll say this for all the stuff at Origin.
02:18:06.20 --> 02:18:07.20 Everything they make is awesome.
02:18:07.20 --> 02:18:09.20 On their website to talk about the hoodie.
02:18:09.20 --> 02:18:11.20 They call it the most comfortable hoodie ever.
02:18:11.20 --> 02:18:12.20 Yeah.
02:18:12.20 --> 02:18:13.20 I grew up 100%.
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:16.20 And the most comfortable hoodie I've ever owned.
02:18:16.20 --> 02:18:17.20 So that stuff is legit.
02:18:17.20 --> 02:18:18.20 No joke.
02:18:18.20 --> 02:18:19.20 No.
02:18:19.20 --> 02:18:22.20 No personal offense to you Dave because I respect you.
02:18:22.20 --> 02:18:23.20 I do.
02:18:23.20 --> 02:18:24.20 I really respect you as a person.
02:18:24.20 --> 02:18:28.20 But your level of measuring comfort is not even close to echo.
02:18:28.20 --> 02:18:31.20 Echo is sort of the quality comfort control guy.
02:18:31.20 --> 02:18:33.20 And he has already made this statement.
02:18:33.20 --> 02:18:36.20 So you saying it is like everyone is listening on whatever.
02:18:36.20 --> 02:18:37.20 Yeah.
02:18:37.20 --> 02:18:38.20 You're in the Marine Corps.
02:18:38.20 --> 02:18:39.20 You've done some.
02:18:39.20 --> 02:18:41.20 You've, you know, you've done some tough stuff in your life.
02:18:41.20 --> 02:18:43.20 They're looking at echo.
02:18:43.20 --> 02:18:44.20 They're like wait.
02:18:44.20 --> 02:18:45.20 If echo thinks it's gonna go.
02:18:45.20 --> 02:18:46.20 We're in.
02:18:46.20 --> 02:18:47.20 Yeah.
02:18:47.20 --> 02:18:49.20 That actual statement is meaning.
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:50.20 Yeah.
02:18:50.20 --> 02:18:51.20 Yeah.
02:18:51.20 --> 02:18:52.20 But I will say, you know, sure.
02:18:52.20 --> 02:18:54.20 Like, of course, Dave Burke, of course.
02:18:54.20 --> 02:18:55.20 You know, you know, I, yeah.
02:18:55.20 --> 02:18:57.20 I am the gold standard of comfort.
02:18:57.20 --> 02:18:58.20 The evaluation for sure.
02:18:58.20 --> 02:18:59.20 I think.
02:18:59.20 --> 02:19:00.20 And I will second that.
02:19:00.20 --> 02:19:03.20 It is the hoodie and the pants by the way.
02:19:03.20 --> 02:19:05.20 So yeah.

02:19:10.20 --> 02:19:13.20 All that I'm just saying there's all this stuff on the website.

02:19:45.20 --> 02:19:46.20 Probably no chocolate too.
02:19:46.20 --> 02:19:49.20 Well, if you know echo you know me and that means you know they're Burke.
02:19:49.20 --> 02:19:50.20 No three of us.
02:19:50.20 --> 02:19:51.20 Three people already.
02:19:51.20 --> 02:19:52.20 We're all right.
02:19:52.20 --> 02:19:53.20 Rolling.
02:19:53.20 --> 02:19:57.20 And here's the good thing where when you go there, we technically sure
02:19:57.20 --> 02:19:59.20 new each other and you new Pete.
02:19:59.20 --> 02:20:01.20 That was the first time I met Pete.
02:20:01.20 --> 02:20:04.20 I met probably what?
02:20:04.20 --> 02:20:07.20 Like the first 15 minutes.
02:20:07.20 --> 02:20:10.20 We met about 20 people.
02:20:10.20 --> 02:20:11.20 Yeah.
02:20:11.20 --> 02:20:16.20 And we hung out with those 20 people plus the other people you meet over the days, the whole time.
02:20:16.20 --> 02:20:18.20 He wasn't the kind like, oh, I don't really know that.
02:20:18.20 --> 02:20:20.20 And I'm hanging over here and there over there.
02:20:20.20 --> 02:20:21.20 It wasn't.
02:20:21.20 --> 02:20:22.20 It's not like that.
02:20:22.20 --> 02:20:24.20 You ever heard of those like dating sites?
02:20:24.20 --> 02:20:25.20 No, seriously.
02:20:25.20 --> 02:20:26.20 You put in like match.
02:20:26.20 --> 02:20:27.20 Well, you look at it.
02:20:27.20 --> 02:20:28.20 Okay.
02:20:28.20 --> 02:20:29.20 So I grew up before dating sites.
02:20:29.20 --> 02:20:30.20 Or I got married before dating sites.
02:20:30.20 --> 02:20:33.20 So I was just like, do the game back in the day.
02:20:33.20 --> 02:20:36.20 Like you got to go to a place where you can hopefully meet a girl.
02:20:36.20 --> 02:20:37.20 Right?
02:20:37.20 --> 02:20:43.20 The odds of meeting a girl are not the girl that you like and that has some sort of remotely similar interest.
02:20:43.20 --> 02:20:49.20 You go into a bar of the hundred girls in there and like you're lucky if there's one of them there that's remotely interested in what you're interested in.
02:20:49.20 --> 02:20:50.20 And you can connect.
02:20:50.20 --> 02:20:51.20 Then you got to meet them.
02:20:51.20 --> 02:20:52.20 You got to go up and talk to them all the stuff.
02:20:52.20 --> 02:20:53.20 It's real hard.
02:20:53.20 --> 02:20:58.20 Then they made the match dating things online where you put in your stuff.
02:20:58.20 --> 02:20:59.20 Yeah.
02:20:59.20 --> 02:21:01.20 And then you meet that one person.
02:21:01.20 --> 02:21:04.20 And you connect with them and you have all these things in common.
02:21:04.20 --> 02:21:06.20 This situation, you think about it.
02:21:06.20 --> 02:21:09.20 You're actually just going into a place where everyone's into the same thing that you're into.
02:21:09.20 --> 02:21:12.20 It's like walking to a bar and everyone likes the same stuff.
02:21:12.20 --> 02:21:12.20 Right.
02:21:12.20 --> 02:21:15.20 Like you get to and wants to train and wants to hang out.
02:21:15.20 --> 02:21:17.20 And that's that's what makes it cool.
02:21:17.20 --> 02:21:18.20 Yeah.
02:21:18.20 --> 02:21:18.20 Yeah.
02:21:18.20 --> 02:21:20.20 No dating typically.
02:21:20.20 --> 02:21:21.20 But hey, yeah.
02:21:21.20 --> 02:21:22.20 Yeah.
02:21:22.20 --> 02:21:23.20 It's a good point.
02:21:23.20 --> 02:21:24.20 Everyone kind of.
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:28.20 You kind of converge on the topic of.
02:21:28.20 --> 02:21:30.20 You get to and then kind of everything else.
02:21:30.20 --> 02:21:32.20 It's what it really seemed like to meet.
02:21:32.20 --> 02:21:34.20 And then everything spends back to you.
02:21:34.20 --> 02:21:35.20 Yeah.
02:21:35.20 --> 02:21:36.20 Yeah.
02:21:36.20 --> 02:21:37.20 It's good fun.
02:21:37.20 --> 02:21:40.20 So my input is to go.
02:21:40.20 --> 02:21:41.20 That's what I think.
02:21:41.20 --> 02:21:42.20 I think go.
02:21:42.20 --> 02:21:43.20 When it now go.
02:21:43.20 --> 02:21:44.20 It's going.
02:21:44.20 --> 02:21:45.20 I'm going.
02:21:45.20 --> 02:21:46.20 Life is going.
02:21:46.20 --> 02:21:47.20 Good.
02:21:47.20 --> 02:21:48.20 Confirmed.
02:21:48.20 --> 02:21:49.20 JPE's considering.
02:21:49.20 --> 02:21:50.20 Oh, go.
02:21:50.20 --> 02:21:51.20 Help probably end up going.
02:21:51.20 --> 02:21:52.20 Yeah.
02:21:52.20 --> 02:21:53.20 So it will be a little.
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:57.20 EF reunion tour of the shoes.
02:21:57.20 --> 02:21:58.20 It's a boy.
02:21:58.20 --> 02:21:59.20 Yep.
02:21:59.20 --> 02:22:00.20 Great.
02:22:00.20 --> 02:22:01.20 And when you go there knowing zero.
02:22:01.20 --> 02:22:05.20 You'll leave there not only knowing more people, but they'll be kind of your friends.
02:22:05.20 --> 02:22:09.20 I will guarantee you'll have more actual friends after you leave guaranteed.
02:22:09.20 --> 02:22:10.20 This is too.
02:22:10.20 --> 02:22:11.20 To the lady that.
02:22:11.20 --> 02:22:12.20 That's what I think.
02:22:12.20 --> 02:22:13.20 That's what I think.
02:22:13.20 --> 02:22:14.20 That's good.
02:22:14.20 --> 02:22:15.20 That's good.
02:22:15.20 --> 02:22:20.20 And even if you will know some people there, I say go to because you can't immerse yourself in.
02:22:20.20 --> 02:22:21.20 You get to best with a learn.
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:23.20 And you know, let's face it.

02:24:14.20 --> 02:24:16.20 Well, either way, the point there is to change their thing.
02:24:16.20 --> 02:24:17.20 What do you mean?
02:24:17.20 --> 02:24:19.20 There's their layout or something.
02:24:19.20 --> 02:24:21.20 So now it pops up different.
02:24:21.20 --> 02:24:22.20 Everything's different now.
02:24:22.20 --> 02:24:23.20 It's interesting.
02:24:23.20 --> 02:24:26.20 It's interesting.
02:24:26.20 --> 02:24:27.20 I know.
02:24:27.20 --> 02:24:29.20 It's like you ever realize when you the layout of something.
02:24:29.20 --> 02:24:30.20 So this is a big thing on Facebook.
02:24:30.20 --> 02:24:31.20 When do you get on Facebook?
02:24:31.20 --> 02:24:32.20 Did you remember?
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:34.20 2014.
02:24:34.20 --> 02:24:35.20 14.
02:24:35.20 --> 02:24:36.20 Dang.
02:24:36.20 --> 02:24:37.20 That's that's pretty.
02:24:37.20 --> 02:24:38.20 It's a requirement for school.
02:24:38.20 --> 02:24:39.20 Okay.
02:24:39.20 --> 02:24:40.20 There you go.
02:24:40.20 --> 02:24:46.20 So were you in on Facebook when they kind of changed the layout of Facebook from something
02:24:46.20 --> 02:24:47.20 to something to like news feed?
02:24:47.20 --> 02:24:48.20 Like a jockey.
02:24:48.20 --> 02:24:49.20 Oh, jockey doesn't know anything.
02:24:49.20 --> 02:24:50.20 What?
02:24:50.20 --> 02:24:52.20 You know what I'm talking about at all, huh?
02:24:52.20 --> 02:24:55.20 No, I didn't get on Facebook for until probably like 2000.
02:24:55.20 --> 02:24:58.20 I was might have been on, but I didn't actively do anything on it
02:24:58.20 --> 02:25:00.20 till like maybe a year ago.
02:25:00.20 --> 02:25:01.20 Yeah.
02:25:01.20 --> 02:25:02.20 Okay.
02:25:02.20 --> 02:25:03.20 So maybe a year and a half.
02:25:03.20 --> 02:25:06.20 So the layout of Facebook was like, you know, you had your profile picture
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:08.20 and I even, I'm just trying to remember what it was.
02:25:08.20 --> 02:25:10.20 It was like, I don't even remember what it was.
02:25:10.20 --> 02:25:14.20 But it was like, I think like your wall or something like that
02:25:14.20 --> 02:25:16.20 where it's like your just your own stuff.
02:25:16.20 --> 02:25:20.20 And then they all of a sudden switched it to this news feed situation.
02:25:20.20 --> 02:25:23.20 You know how like now it's like everyone's stuff that you're just,
02:25:23.20 --> 02:25:24.20 basically how it is now.
02:25:24.20 --> 02:25:25.20 They just switched it.
02:25:25.20 --> 02:25:27.20 And people were mad.
02:25:27.20 --> 02:25:29.20 It was like change their life.
02:25:29.20 --> 02:25:30.20 You know, they were pissed.
02:25:30.20 --> 02:25:34.20 That's what you sounded like when you just talked about the apples.
02:25:34.20 --> 02:25:37.20 You know, you had that same effect on your brain.
02:25:37.20 --> 02:25:39.20 Anyway, subscribe to the podcast what I'm saying.
02:25:39.20 --> 02:25:44.20 Regardless of the layout of any iTunes or any other applications that the layout has
02:25:44.20 --> 02:25:45.20 or has not changed.
02:25:45.20 --> 02:25:47.20 Good way to support.
02:25:47.20 --> 02:25:49.20 Also, whatever you do channel so subscribe to that.
02:25:49.20 --> 02:25:53.20 If you want and if you're interested in the video version of this podcast,
02:25:53.20 --> 02:25:56.20 you would, juggle looks like or Dave Burke.
02:25:56.20 --> 02:25:58.20 In this case, what he looks like, pretty handsome.
02:25:58.20 --> 02:26:02.20 I think as far as handsome goes or Colonel Tom Five.
02:26:02.20 --> 02:26:03.20 Yes.
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:04.20 See what he looks like.
02:26:04.20 --> 02:26:07.20 Yeah, typically those are the ones that people want to see.
02:26:07.20 --> 02:26:08.20 You know, they want to see the guests.
02:26:08.20 --> 02:26:09.20 They want to see what they look like.
02:26:09.20 --> 02:26:11.20 They know what we look like.
02:26:11.20 --> 02:26:12.20 Yeah, they kind of already know.
02:26:12.20 --> 02:26:14.20 Except me, I guess they don't really know what I look like.
02:26:14.20 --> 02:26:17.20 Because it still do get hey, you don't look like how you sound.
02:26:17.20 --> 02:26:18.20 Right.
02:26:18.20 --> 02:26:20.20 You can look like how you sound.
02:26:20.20 --> 02:26:22.20 Like you look like how you sound.
02:26:22.20 --> 02:26:23.20 Jack.
02:26:23.20 --> 02:26:24.20 Same.
02:26:24.20 --> 02:26:25.20 Dave Burke looks how he sounds.
02:26:25.20 --> 02:26:27.20 But it's not a one-to-one.
02:26:27.20 --> 02:26:29.20 It's not a face to like your voice sounds like this.
02:26:29.20 --> 02:26:31.20 So your face is going to look like that.
02:26:31.20 --> 02:26:33.20 It's like your your voice sounds like this.
02:26:33.20 --> 02:26:37.20 So your face can look like this kind of real like this group.
02:26:37.20 --> 02:26:40.20 This little variety of faith possible faces.
02:26:40.20 --> 02:26:42.20 You're just saying that's how it works.
02:26:42.20 --> 02:26:44.20 But for you, your voice is not that.
02:26:44.20 --> 02:26:47.20 My face is outside of that group apparently.
02:26:47.20 --> 02:26:50.20 So if you're interested in that sort of thing,
02:26:50.20 --> 02:26:51.20 YouTube boons.
02:26:51.20 --> 02:26:52.20 Also have the excerpts on there.
02:26:52.20 --> 02:26:55.20 If you want, you know, some of the lessons that Jack will talk about.
02:26:55.20 --> 02:26:56.20 You know, you want to share them.
02:26:56.20 --> 02:26:57.20 They're they're condensed.
02:26:57.20 --> 02:26:59.20 Or actually they're not condensed.
02:26:59.20 --> 02:27:01.20 They're just taken out of there.
02:27:01.20 --> 02:27:03.20 You know, maybe little videos on there.
02:27:03.20 --> 02:27:06.20 Also enhance the excerpts to put some music on there.
02:27:06.20 --> 02:27:07.20 Make them more.
02:27:07.20 --> 02:27:09.20 Somebody asked for tracks.
02:27:09.20 --> 02:27:13.20 Enhanced excerpts in psychological warfare available on iTunes.
02:27:13.20 --> 02:27:16.20 So, um, does that make sense?
02:27:16.20 --> 02:27:17.20 Yeah, enhance the answers.
02:27:17.20 --> 02:27:20.20 In the end, I think that's why I'm for psychological warfare too.
02:27:20.20 --> 02:27:21.20 By the way, just why I agree.
02:27:21.20 --> 02:27:22.20 I agree.
02:27:22.20 --> 02:27:24.20 I agree on a lot of requests for things like that.
02:27:24.20 --> 02:27:27.20 I agree, but not from a personal interest standpoint,
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:29.20 because the psychological warfare.
02:27:29.20 --> 02:27:31.20 One is still very effective.
02:27:31.20 --> 02:27:34.20 100% effective for me.
02:27:34.20 --> 02:27:35.20 Now with tracks.
02:27:35.20 --> 02:27:36.20 Yeah.
02:27:36.20 --> 02:27:40.20 Which I will talk about after I talk about the fact that
02:27:40.20 --> 02:27:41.20 Jack was a store.
02:27:41.20 --> 02:27:43.20 It's called Jocco store.
02:27:43.20 --> 02:27:47.20 This is where you can get the T-shirts that say this will equals freedom like the one I'm wearing right now.
02:27:47.20 --> 02:27:49.20 Or the Jocco podcast shirt.
02:27:49.20 --> 02:27:50.20 Basic.
02:27:50.20 --> 02:27:51.20 But very nice.
02:27:51.20 --> 02:27:53.20 I want that date book is wearing right now.
02:27:53.20 --> 02:27:57.20 Also, Mr. where you tell me you got called out with the Jocco podcast t-shirt.

02:27:58.20 --> 02:27:59.20 I'm wearing this exact shirt.
02:27:59.20 --> 02:28:03.20 I'm at Disney World with the family that's going to do these ago from across the way.
02:28:03.20 --> 02:28:05.20 I get a good evening echo.
02:28:05.20 --> 02:28:07.20 Yeah, that's the standard bona fides.
02:28:07.20 --> 02:28:10.20 Yeah, that standard bona fides is good evening echo.
02:28:10.20 --> 02:28:12.20 Very good.
02:28:12.20 --> 02:28:13.20 Yeah, looks good on you.
02:28:13.20 --> 02:28:14.20 Of course.
02:28:14.20 --> 02:28:18.20 And even if you want to win the Jocco as on now, the one that Jocco always has on right now.
02:28:18.20 --> 02:28:21.20 The one he has on right now and always has on.
02:28:21.20 --> 02:28:22.20 You see what I'm saying?
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:29.20 Anyway, if you want that shirt going jocco store.com or if you want a hoodie or if you want a hat or if you want a rash guard.
02:28:29.20 --> 02:28:30.20 Anyway, just go in there.

02:28:33.20 --> 02:28:35.20 If you want something, get something.
02:28:35.20 --> 02:28:37.20 It's called jocco store.com.
02:28:37.20 --> 02:28:41.20 Also, just like Jocco mentioned psychological warfare.
02:28:41.20 --> 02:28:44.20 Isn't it album with tracks?
02:28:44.20 --> 02:28:46.20 Basically, these tracks are each track.
02:28:46.20 --> 02:28:48.20 You can get these on iTunes by the way.
02:28:48.20 --> 02:28:53.20 So, each track is Jocco telling you how to get past certain weaknesses that you might have.
02:28:53.20 --> 02:28:58.20 Might have on your campaign against weakness.
02:28:58.20 --> 02:29:00.20 So, you know, you're on the path, right?
02:29:00.20 --> 02:29:02.20 We're working out, we're waking up early, some of us.
02:29:02.20 --> 02:29:05.20 And, you know, we're reading more, whatever we're doing.
02:29:05.20 --> 02:29:06.20 Sometimes you don't want to do that.
02:29:06.20 --> 02:29:07.20 You don't do that every day.
02:29:07.20 --> 02:29:10.20 You just don't feel like it on some days, but you still should do it.
02:29:10.20 --> 02:29:11.20 We all know that.
02:29:11.20 --> 02:29:12.20 It's something that you don't feel like it.
02:29:12.20 --> 02:29:13.20 So, you're about to skip the workout.
02:29:13.20 --> 02:29:15.20 Boom, you listen to a certain track.
02:29:15.20 --> 02:29:17.20 Jocco will tell you why you shouldn't skip the workout.
02:29:17.20 --> 02:29:18.20 And it's effective.
02:29:18.20 --> 02:29:19.20 You won't skip the workout.

02:30:33.20 --> 02:30:40.20 We're going to get rid of all the horrible energy drinks that are out there, making people sick.
02:30:40.20 --> 02:30:47.20 And we're going to place with Jocco White Tea, which is 8,000 pounds of pure power.
02:30:47.20 --> 02:30:48.20 Let me ask you this.
02:30:48.20 --> 02:30:49.20 Yes.
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:50.20 About Jocco White Tea.
02:30:50.20 --> 02:30:56.20 Would you consider making the micro dose or a version that doesn't have just a micro dose of caffeine?
02:30:56.20 --> 02:30:59.20 But if you drink the, no, probably not.
02:30:59.20 --> 02:31:00.20 No more caffeine.
02:31:00.20 --> 02:31:01.20 No.
02:31:01.20 --> 02:31:03.20 The Jocco White Tea can.
02:31:03.20 --> 02:31:05.20 I think it's two servings.
02:31:05.20 --> 02:31:06.20 And I think it's 30 grams.
02:31:06.20 --> 02:31:07.20 I'll confirm that.
02:31:07.20 --> 02:31:08.20 Yeah.
02:31:08.20 --> 02:31:09.20 I shouldn't have said it.
02:31:09.20 --> 02:31:14.20 I don't think we've ever considered making like another, another version in the future or anything like that.

02:31:21.20 --> 02:31:22.20 Okay.
02:31:22.20 --> 02:31:22.20 I don't think so.
