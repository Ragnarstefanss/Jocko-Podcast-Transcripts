00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.80 This is Jocco podcast number 78 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.80 --> 00:00:09.30 Good evening, echo.
00:00:09.30 --> 00:00:12.80 Good evening.
00:00:12.80 --> 00:00:16.000 Nightmare.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.20 Now that's a word that I use often times to describe the most horrible things and the most
00:00:24.20 --> 00:00:38.40 wretched things and in my hierarchy of adjectives, nightmare is right alongside of hell.
00:00:38.40 --> 00:00:41.80 And I'm not sure which one is worse in my mind.
00:00:41.80 --> 00:00:47.84 That's why I say they're right alongside each other because hell is beyond the worst thing
00:00:47.84 --> 00:00:49.48 your mind can imagine.
00:00:49.48 --> 00:00:58.68 And that's basically what a nightmare is when you're asleep and your mind delves into
00:00:58.68 --> 00:01:05.20 the most horrific things beyond what you can consciously and willfully imagine in your
00:01:05.20 --> 00:01:09.000 own head.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.48 That's what a nightmare is.
00:01:10.48 --> 00:01:19.40 Now what if there was a place that was worse than a
00:01:19.40 --> 00:01:22.60 nightmare?
00:01:22.60 --> 00:01:26.60 And it was a real place.
00:01:26.60 --> 00:01:36.28 Who could create such a place?
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:44.48 And the answer to that is we can.
00:01:44.48 --> 00:01:50.000 I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner who
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.92 threw himself about and asleep obviously having a horrible nightmare.
00:01:57.92 --> 00:02:01.96 Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffer from fearful dreams or
00:02:01.96 --> 00:02:06.24 deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man.
00:02:06.24 --> 00:02:10.40 Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him frightened at the thing I was
00:02:10.40 --> 00:02:13.08 about to do.
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:21.60 At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream no matter how horrible
00:02:21.60 --> 00:02:29.40 could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us and to which I was about
00:02:29.40 --> 00:02:34.20 to recall him.
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:41.88 And that's a quote from the book, Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Franco which will
00:02:41.88 --> 00:02:45.24 be appearing in two today.
00:02:45.24 --> 00:02:55.72 And it's a book about the Nazi concentration camps which are really as he pointed out
00:02:55.72 --> 00:03:02.28 there worse than any nightmare we can imagine.
00:03:02.28 --> 00:03:05.88 Here's a Holocaust survivor.
00:03:05.88 --> 00:03:15.28 He won't be Weinstein on the death and the atrocities in Treblinka.
00:03:15.28 --> 00:03:18.12 By now the transports were coming every day.
00:03:18.12 --> 00:03:23.80 One was much like the next, the same incidents recurred again and again.
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:28.84 Once as I swept out the interior of a car, an SS man suddenly struck me with his weapon
00:03:28.84 --> 00:03:34.60 ordered me to help a woman who was unable to stand and climb out of the car.
00:03:34.60 --> 00:03:40.52 The idea was to show his victims how well the ill would be treated.
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:46.68 Then he ordered one of the workers to take the woman to the field, the field hospital
00:03:46.68 --> 00:03:49.000 for care.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.64 The newcomers really believed that the alien woman would be taken to an infermary.
00:03:55.64 --> 00:04:01.84 None of them realized that the field hospital was in fact just a giant pit about 30 yards
00:04:01.84 --> 00:04:06.000 in diameter which was always a blaze.
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.20 They would place those who were sick or disabled on the ground at the edge of the pit facing
00:04:12.20 --> 00:04:13.52 in.
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:19.72 The SS man in charge circulated among them and shot them in the back of the neck.
00:04:19.72 --> 00:04:22.96 Then the workers cast them into the pit.
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:28.52 Some of the victims were still breathing when they were tossed in with the other bodies.
00:04:28.52 --> 00:04:34.64 The pit was separated from the spacious field by a barrier of fresh pine branches which
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:40.24 were replaced from time to time to conceal the infirmary from the newcomers until the last
00:04:40.24 --> 00:04:42.60 moment.
00:04:42.60 --> 00:04:47.04 20 minutes after I helped the woman climb out of the railroad car, I was told that some
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:53.28 infants were sitting by the pit and no one else was there because the SS soldier had taken
00:04:53.28 --> 00:04:55.20 his lunch break.
00:04:55.20 --> 00:04:58.96 I gathered some trash and went over there.
00:04:58.96 --> 00:05:02.96 I saw the woman who I had removed from the car, still breathing, sitting at the edge
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:08.32 of the pit and staring in fright into the burning inferno and its contents.
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:16.32 The half-cremated bodies of old people and children mixed with smoldering trash.
00:05:16.32 --> 00:05:21.32 She tried to stand up but her legs would not hold her.
00:05:21.32 --> 00:05:27.44 She looked at the workers who stirred the embers remnants of human beings so they would burn
00:05:27.44 --> 00:05:31.44 better.
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:34.92 Nearby we were about a dozen infants.
00:05:34.92 --> 00:05:38.72 Too young to have learned how to walk, they were not crying.
00:05:38.72 --> 00:05:42.40 They certainly did not understand what was happening.
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:49.08 They looked about almost certainly in hopes of finding their mother or father.
00:05:49.08 --> 00:05:53.64 Later I heard that right after he returned from his lunch break, the SS man shot them all
00:05:53.64 --> 00:05:59.24 and ordered the workers to throw the tiny bodies into the flames.
00:05:59.24 --> 00:06:08.000 Of all my memories of that accursed place, the vision of these babies is undoubtedly the worst.
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.24 I see their faces whenever I remember Trimblinka.
00:06:13.24 --> 00:06:28.56 As I write these lines more than 50 years after that day, I still cannot overcome the horror.
00:06:28.56 --> 00:06:36.48 In another report, here Martin's Spet of Tarnow, Poland, describes the massacre of Tarnow
00:06:36.48 --> 00:06:40.68 Jews in an interview.
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:44.48 We heard the columns of Jews under German escort at night.
00:06:44.48 --> 00:06:46.96 It was going constantly.
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:51.76 They were passing our house because this was already on the outskirts of the city, the
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:56.68 cemetery and they were marching them to the woods behind the city.
00:06:56.68 --> 00:07:01.36 As we found out later, they were all shot over there.
00:07:01.36 --> 00:07:03.48 During the day I looked out through the shingles.
00:07:03.48 --> 00:07:09.84 My father said I shouldn't look but anyway, I was a kid, I was curious.
00:07:09.84 --> 00:07:16.36 The roof was overlooking the cemetery and wagons with bodies dead bodies were coming in.
00:07:16.36 --> 00:07:22.28 Groups, they were bringing in groups of Jewish people that had to dig trenches.
00:07:22.28 --> 00:07:26.88 They had to dig ditches and the bodies dumped in.
00:07:26.88 --> 00:07:33.36 After those Jews that dug the ditches, they were shot also and pushed in by another
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:39.60 group that came in after them into those ditches and lime was poured over the bodies.
00:07:39.60 --> 00:07:48.84 The next group covered up those ditches and dug other ditches.
00:07:48.84 --> 00:07:59.44 They brought in pregnant women and they didn't use any bullets.
00:07:59.44 --> 00:08:04.20 They used bayonets.
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:16.32 The screams of the mothers that their children, they tore their children out of their arms
00:08:16.32 --> 00:08:27.56 and the screams of the children, I still hear.
00:08:27.56 --> 00:08:40.36 The Solomon Redaski, who is the only survivor from the 78 people in his family.
00:08:40.36 --> 00:08:49.56 Described the concentration camp, they throw the people in the crematoriums that children.
00:08:49.56 --> 00:08:54.44 I will never forget alive.
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:00.04 They throw them in the crematoriums.
00:09:00.04 --> 00:09:05.08 They grabbed by an arm, by a leg, by the head and throw them into the ovens.
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:07.68 There it was so tragic.
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:15.48 The cries and people, when crying there, you know it was so terrible.
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:16.84 I can feel it now.
00:09:16.84 --> 00:09:21.20 I can even see the people.
00:09:21.20 --> 00:09:28.88 The other people were crying, the children were hollering, Mama Daddy helped me.
00:09:28.88 --> 00:09:35.60 Mama Daddy helped me.
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:46.000 It was terrible.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.92 One more report, not Trublinka, from Henry Gold.
00:09:53.92 --> 00:10:00.24 The worst thing that happens to a person in that instance, he loses self-respect, and
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:04.16 that's exactly what happened to the majority of the people.
00:10:04.16 --> 00:10:06.000 Some of them even lost their minds.
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.12 They couldn't take it.
00:10:08.12 --> 00:10:09.40 They couldn't take the hunger.
00:10:09.40 --> 00:10:10.80 They couldn't take the beatings.
00:10:10.80 --> 00:10:15.68 They couldn't take the cold, no clothing, and the uncertainty.
00:10:15.68 --> 00:10:19.80 And the uncertainty, I think that was the worst thing that could happen to a person.
00:10:19.80 --> 00:10:24.44 You didn't know from one moment to the next what was going to happen.
00:10:24.44 --> 00:10:25.72 Life was very cheap.
00:10:25.72 --> 00:10:27.52 A person was alive one minute.
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:34.20 The next minute he was shot, killed, beaten up, beaten to death, torn apart by dogs, and so
00:10:34.20 --> 00:10:37.20 on.
00:10:37.20 --> 00:10:43.32 Life was very, very cheap, and that's the way the Germans liked it.
00:10:43.32 --> 00:10:48.36 That particular camp was governed by the Jewish police and so on.
00:10:48.36 --> 00:10:50.28 The Germans did not stay in the camp.
00:10:50.28 --> 00:10:54.24 They were on the outside.
00:10:54.24 --> 00:10:59.92 But the life inside of the camp was just as bad without the Germans being right there
00:10:59.92 --> 00:11:03.04 than if they would be.
00:11:03.04 --> 00:11:08.20 The Jewish police was, I don't know.
00:11:08.20 --> 00:11:12.64 You take a person in that situation, and you give them a little power, and he becomes
00:11:12.64 --> 00:11:17.40 the same as the oppressor himself.
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:24.96 There were some policemen that were not bad, but there were a lot of them that were ruthless.
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:28.56 There were others that would beat people, and do all kinds of things that would degrade
00:11:28.56 --> 00:11:32.64 them and so on, especially women.
00:11:32.64 --> 00:11:35.20 They cut their hair off, and they looked like men.
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:40.20 They looked like scarecrows, and they would get beaten up by the Jewish police just as bad
00:11:40.20 --> 00:11:45.32 as the man for no reason at all.
00:11:45.32 --> 00:11:50.68 If they wanted a little more soup, where they were distributing soup, and there was some
00:11:50.68 --> 00:11:55.44 left, and they were going to give everybody a little bit, and the Jewish police with their
00:11:55.44 --> 00:12:03.56 sticks and rubber hoses would beat them half-centeless.
00:12:03.56 --> 00:12:07.72 That's what happens when the conditions are the way they were then.
00:12:07.72 --> 00:12:13.96 When a person becomes an animal, and loses self-respect, that is willing to get a beating,
00:12:13.96 --> 00:12:21.16 and get beaten half-centeless just to get a little bit of soup.
00:12:21.16 --> 00:12:29.04 Either you died, or if you didn't die, the Germans would come and take you away.
00:12:29.04 --> 00:12:32.36 The filth was just terrible in the camp.
00:12:32.36 --> 00:12:33.88 In the barracks you had caught.
00:12:33.88 --> 00:12:40.24 I mean, bonks were everybody slept on straw, there were no covers, was no pillows, nothing.
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:43.96 You slept in your clothes and the winners, and the winner because you're afraid to get
00:12:43.96 --> 00:12:45.84 cold.
00:12:45.84 --> 00:12:49.56 The only heating was a pop belly stove in the middle of the barrack.
00:12:49.56 --> 00:12:53.44 When somebody stole some wood in the factory or something, then we had a fire otherwise
00:12:53.44 --> 00:12:57.08 it was freezing.
00:12:57.08 --> 00:13:04.16 They only warmth they had if you huddled together and they kept warm that way, but nobody
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:06.92 would get undressed.
00:13:06.92 --> 00:13:10.20 The lights were eating you up alive.
00:13:10.20 --> 00:13:14.48 Once a month you were allowed to take a shower, and we had to walk to camp a to go to the
00:13:14.48 --> 00:13:19.60 showers, and that means a 10-mile walk.
00:13:19.60 --> 00:13:23.84 10 miles there and 10 miles back.
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:30.52 There were a lot of people were too weak to walk, and those people hardly ever took a shower.
00:13:30.52 --> 00:13:34.64 There was no hot water in the washer, there was only cold, and in the winter you were
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:39.80 afraid to wash up because there was nothing to wipe yourself with, therefore you would
00:13:39.80 --> 00:13:50.80 walk out in the cold, winter, and freeze to death.
00:13:50.80 --> 00:14:02.64 And we gold, brothers and both of his parents were all killed in the gas chambers.
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:09.40 And from the Boocan walled report, which was translated and edited with an introduction
00:14:09.40 --> 00:14:16.68 by David A. Hackett, I will now describe the crematoriums and the transports.
00:14:16.68 --> 00:14:20.56 With the station 2,000 people got off the trains.
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:23.40 They had to throw away all their luggage.
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:27.88 Afterwards, the men and women were divided into two groups, at which the larger boys were
00:14:27.88 --> 00:14:32.28 assigned to the group with the men.
00:14:32.28 --> 00:14:37.20 Then that great devour of Jews, Mengala drove by and a car seeking out the strongest
00:14:37.20 --> 00:14:40.28 from each transport.
00:14:40.28 --> 00:14:43.92 They numbered around 30 out of 2,000.
00:14:43.92 --> 00:14:52.48 The remainder were led away by SS Technical Sergeant Moll, the officer of the crematorium.
00:14:52.48 --> 00:14:56.12 The elderly were loaded onto dump trucks and then dumped into burning trenches while
00:14:56.12 --> 00:14:59.32 still alive.
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:03.68 The remainder were led to the gas chambers.
00:15:03.68 --> 00:15:07.36 Meanwhile new transports were arriving.
00:15:07.36 --> 00:15:11.60 In front of the gas chamber was a dressing room.
00:15:11.60 --> 00:15:16.56 Its walls were written in all languages, put shoes into the cubby holes and tie them together
00:15:16.56 --> 00:15:19.36 so you will not lose them.
00:15:19.36 --> 00:15:24.84 After the showers, you will receive hot coffee.
00:15:24.84 --> 00:15:30.96 Here poor victims undress themselves and went into the chamber.
00:15:30.96 --> 00:15:36.52 There were three columns for the ventilators through which the gas poured in.
00:15:36.52 --> 00:15:41.92 Special worked detail with trungeons drove the people into the chamber.
00:15:41.92 --> 00:15:47.24 When the room was full, small children were thrown in through a window.
00:15:47.24 --> 00:15:54.92 Sergeant Moll grabbed, infants by their legs and smashed their skulls against the wall.
00:15:54.92 --> 00:15:58.24 Then the gas was led into the chamber.
00:15:58.24 --> 00:16:02.60 The lungs of the victim slowly burst and after three minutes allowed clamoring could
00:16:02.60 --> 00:16:05.32 be heard.
00:16:05.32 --> 00:16:17.64 And the chamber was open and those who still showed signs of life were beaten to death.
00:16:17.64 --> 00:16:23.40 The prisoners of the special work details then pulled corpses out took their rings off
00:16:23.40 --> 00:16:29.32 and cut their hair which was gathered up, put in sacks and shipped to factories.
00:16:29.32 --> 00:16:34.28 Then they arranged the corpses in piles of ten each.
00:16:34.28 --> 00:16:39.84 After Sergeant Moll had counted them, they were taken to the ovens or if the crematoriums,
00:16:39.84 --> 00:16:45.84 crematoriums were insufficient thrown into fire trenches.
00:16:45.84 --> 00:16:49.96 Once it happened that a victim crawled out of a burning trench, he was beaten to death with
00:16:49.96 --> 00:16:54.12 trungeons.
00:16:54.12 --> 00:17:01.36 While Sergeant Moll put a naked woman in the trench and shot her in the genitals, another
00:17:01.36 --> 00:17:05.32 time Moll found a ring on a member of the special work detail.
00:17:05.32 --> 00:17:12.76 He ordered, nap, nap the poured over him and had it lighted.
00:17:12.76 --> 00:17:18.72 He hanged a man by his hands and shot him until his arms were torn through.
00:17:18.72 --> 00:17:25.08 Then he hanged him up by the feet and repeated the process.
00:17:25.08 --> 00:17:31.000 While Sergeant Moll took a family of six, first he shot the youngest in the presence
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:45.32 of the rest, then he shot the older ones and finally their father and mother.
00:17:45.32 --> 00:18:03.32 That's the testimony of John DeWise, who was 15 years old at Burknow.
00:18:03.32 --> 00:18:15.28 So I think it's safe to say that this is a situation that has definitely worse than a nightmare.
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:24.96 And what possibly can we take away from that?
00:18:24.96 --> 00:18:35.80 I think the best thing we can do is try and learn.
00:18:35.80 --> 00:18:42.40 And I think one of the best places to learn and take lessons away from the Holocaust is from
00:18:42.40 --> 00:18:53.44 the book that I started out with today called Man Search for Meaning by Victor Franco.
00:18:53.44 --> 00:19:02.48 Let's go to the book.
00:19:02.48 --> 00:19:07.12 Let us take the case of a transport, which was officially announced to transfer a certain
00:19:07.12 --> 00:19:09.56 number of prisoners to another camp.
00:19:09.56 --> 00:19:15.08 But it was fairly safe to guess that its final destination would be the gas chambers.
00:19:15.08 --> 00:19:20.56 A selection of sick or feeble prisoners incapable of work would be sent to one of the big
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:26.08 central camps which were fitted with gas chambers and crematoriums.
00:19:26.08 --> 00:19:34.000 The selection process was the signal for a free fight among all the prisoners, or of group
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.92 against group.
00:19:36.92 --> 00:19:42.84 All that matter was that one's own name and that of one's friends were crossed off the
00:19:42.84 --> 00:19:48.40 list of victims, though everyone knew that for each man saved another victim had to be
00:19:48.40 --> 00:19:51.32 found.
00:19:51.32 --> 00:19:56.16 A definite number of prisoners had to go with each transport.
00:19:56.16 --> 00:20:02.80 It did not really matter which since each of them was nothing but a number.
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:08.36 On their admission to the camp, all their documents had been taken from them, together
00:20:08.36 --> 00:20:10.64 with other possessions.
00:20:10.64 --> 00:20:14.72 Each prisoner therefore had an opportunity to claim a fictitious name or profession
00:20:14.72 --> 00:20:18.32 and for various reasons many did this.
00:20:18.32 --> 00:20:23.12 The authorities were interested only in the captive's numbers.
00:20:23.12 --> 00:20:27.44 These numbers were often tattooed on their skin and also had to be sewn to a certain
00:20:27.44 --> 00:20:31.64 spot on their trousers jacket or coat.
00:20:31.64 --> 00:20:37.36 He guard who wanted to make a charge against a prisoner just a glance that is number.
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:39.96 And how we dreaded those glances.
00:20:39.96 --> 00:20:43.64 He never asked for his name.
00:20:43.64 --> 00:20:47.96 To return to the convoy about to depart, there was neither time nor desire to consider
00:20:47.96 --> 00:20:50.20 moral or ethical issues.
00:20:50.20 --> 00:20:55.000 Every man was controlled by one fought only to keep himself alive for the family waiting
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.88 for him at home and to save his friends.
00:20:59.88 --> 00:21:05.84 If no hesitation therefore he would arrange for another prisoner another number to take
00:21:05.84 --> 00:21:11.000 his place in the transport.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.88 As I have already mentioned, the process of selecting capos was a negative one.
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:22.76 Only the most brutal of the prisoners were chosen for this job.
00:21:22.76 --> 00:21:33.12 So capos were prisoners, Jewish prisoners that got selected to help run the prison camp.
00:21:33.12 --> 00:21:40.36 And capo, I tried to find the etymology of where that came from and the best or the closest
00:21:40.36 --> 00:21:46.56 or the thing that made the most sense to me from what I read was, was they had two words
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:48.84 combined together.
00:21:48.84 --> 00:21:57.52 Tom Rad Police and the German those got shortened to capo.
00:21:57.52 --> 00:22:02.52 So some of these and you already heard one of those earlier testimonies talking about
00:22:02.52 --> 00:22:09.68 the Jewish police inside the prisons and how they were just as bad as in many cases
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:13.36 as the Germans themselves.
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:14.36 Back to the book.
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:18.08 But apart from the selection of capos which was undertaken by the SS there was a sort
00:22:18.08 --> 00:22:26.000 of self-selecting process going on the whole time among all the prisoners.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.96 On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who.
00:22:30.96 --> 00:22:36.04 After years of trekking from camp to camp had lost all scruples in their fight for
00:22:36.04 --> 00:22:37.32 existence.
00:22:37.32 --> 00:22:43.04 They were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise even brutal force, theft and
00:22:43.04 --> 00:22:49.84 betrayal of friends in order to save themselves.
00:22:49.84 --> 00:22:57.12 We have come back by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles, whatever one may choose
00:22:57.12 --> 00:22:58.68 to call them.
00:22:58.68 --> 00:23:10.16 We know the best of us did not return.
00:23:10.16 --> 00:23:14.96 So there is a dynamic that you don't think of immediately when you think of the concentration
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:15.96 camps.
00:23:15.96 --> 00:23:20.36 Number one, you don't think about the capos, the Jewish police that are forced into this
00:23:20.36 --> 00:23:21.36 situation.
00:23:21.36 --> 00:23:25.12 And then the other thing you don't think about is this the fact that the people that
00:23:25.12 --> 00:23:31.08 we're going to survive were basically making a very broad say.
00:23:31.08 --> 00:23:35.92 But from what Victor Frankl saying here, it was the people that were willing just to do
00:23:35.92 --> 00:23:38.48 anything to survive, including betraying their friends.
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:43.52 And he's saying straight up, we know the best of us did not return.
00:23:43.52 --> 00:23:52.08 And that is something that you don't think about.
00:23:52.08 --> 00:23:55.76 And we probably don't think about it because we don't want to think about it.
00:23:55.76 --> 00:24:00.80 Because when you start thinking about what would you do to survive?
00:24:00.80 --> 00:24:02.68 What would you do to survive?
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:06.08 What would I do to survive?
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:11.52 That's a question. I don't think a lot of people want to know the answer to.
00:24:11.52 --> 00:24:16.20 And it's very easy to go through life and never have to answer that question.
00:24:16.20 --> 00:24:27.68 Just talking a little bit now about what life was like in the camp.
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:28.68 Back to the book.
00:24:28.68 --> 00:24:31.84 Somewhere it is said that man cannot exist without sleep for more than a stated number
00:24:31.84 --> 00:24:32.84 of hours.
00:24:32.84 --> 00:24:34.64 Quite wrong.
00:24:34.64 --> 00:24:38.68 I had been convinced that there were certain things I just could not do.
00:24:38.68 --> 00:24:44.48 I could not sleep without this or I could not live without that or the other.
00:24:44.48 --> 00:24:50.68 The first night in Auschwitz, we slept in beds which were constructed in tears.
00:24:50.68 --> 00:24:56.52 On each tier, measuring about six and one half to eight feet slept nine men.
00:24:56.52 --> 00:24:58.84 Directly on the boards.
00:24:58.84 --> 00:25:03.88 Two blankets would be shared by each nine men.
00:25:03.88 --> 00:25:09.32 We could of course lie only on our sides, crowded and huddled against each other,
00:25:09.32 --> 00:25:13.08 which had some advantages because of the bitter cold.
00:25:13.08 --> 00:25:18.60 Though it was forbidden to take shoes up to the bunks, some people did use them secretly
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:22.04 as pillows, and spite of the fact that they were caked with mud.
00:25:22.04 --> 00:25:29.40 Otherwise, one's head had to rest on the crook of an almost dislocated arm.
00:25:29.40 --> 00:25:39.72 And yet sleep came and brought oblivion and relief from the pain for a few hours.
00:25:39.72 --> 00:25:45.92 The thaw to suicide was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time.
00:25:45.92 --> 00:25:51.48 It was born of hopelessness of the situation, the constant danger of death looming over us
00:25:51.48 --> 00:25:58.28 daily and hourly, and the closeness of deaths suffered by many of the others.
00:25:58.28 --> 00:26:03.52 In personal convictions, which we mentioned later, I made a firm promise on my first evening
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:07.52 in the camp that I would not run to the wire.
00:26:07.52 --> 00:26:12.000 This was a phrase used in camp to describe the most popular method of suicide, touching
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.52 the electrical, electrically charged barbed wire fence.
00:26:15.52 --> 00:26:20.24 It was not entirely difficult for me to make this decision.
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:25.28 There was little point committing suicide since, for the average inmate, life expectation
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:32.40 calculating objectively and counting all likely chances was very poor.
00:26:32.40 --> 00:26:35.88 You could not without any assurance, you could not with any assurance expect to be among
00:26:35.88 --> 00:26:40.48 the small percentage of men who survived all the selections.
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:45.92 The prisoner of Auschwitz, in the first phase of shock, did not fear death.
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.52 Even the gas chambers lost their horrors for him after the first few days after all.
00:26:52.52 --> 00:27:02.52 They spared him the act of committing suicide.
00:27:02.52 --> 00:27:11.76 Victor Frankle was a psychiatrist going into this situation.
00:27:11.76 --> 00:27:17.04 That's the view, that's the perspective that he takes throughout this.
00:27:17.04 --> 00:27:27.76 He's now been in for a couple days in Auschwitz and another guy comes into talk to him,
00:27:27.76 --> 00:27:30.08 who's another colleague of his.
00:27:30.08 --> 00:27:33.16 And we're going back to the book, a colleague of mine who had arrived in Auschwitz several
00:27:33.16 --> 00:27:36.72 weeks previously smuggled himself into our hut.
00:27:36.72 --> 00:27:40.16 He wanted a common comfort us and tell us a few things.
00:27:40.16 --> 00:27:44.56 He had become so thin that at first we did not recognize him.
00:27:44.56 --> 00:27:49.84 With a show of good humor and a devil-made care attitude he gave us a few hurried tips.
00:27:49.84 --> 00:27:52.68 Don't be afraid, don't fear the selections.
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:58.68 Dr. M, the SS medical chief, has a soft spot for doctors.
00:27:58.68 --> 00:28:04.28 But one thing I beg of you, he continued, shave daily if at all possible even if you have
00:28:04.28 --> 00:28:06.96 to use a piece of glass to do it.
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:11.24 Even if you have to give your last piece of bread for it.
00:28:11.24 --> 00:28:16.28 You will look younger and the scraping will make your cheeks look rudier.
00:28:16.28 --> 00:28:19.56 If you want to stay alive, there is only one way.
00:28:19.56 --> 00:28:21.16 Look fit for work.
00:28:21.16 --> 00:28:26.84 If you even limp because let us say you have a small blister on your heel and an SS man
00:28:26.84 --> 00:28:40.72 spots this, he will wave you aside and the next day you are sure to be gasped.
00:28:40.72 --> 00:28:52.96 Now his mind and his thoughts, he describes what he would think about.
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:58.04 Back to the book, my mind still clung to the image of my wife.
00:28:58.04 --> 00:29:03.20 A thought crossed my mind, I didn't even know if she was still alive.
00:29:03.20 --> 00:29:08.68 I knew only one thing which I have learned well by now.
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:13.80 Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved.
00:29:13.80 --> 00:29:19.52 It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, in his inner self.
00:29:19.52 --> 00:29:23.80 Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all ceases
00:29:23.80 --> 00:29:28.36 somehow to be of importance.
00:29:28.36 --> 00:29:35.000 I did not know whether my wife was alive and had no means of finding out.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.72 Everything was happening all my present life, there was no outgoing or incoming male.
00:29:40.72 --> 00:29:45.000 But at that moment it ceased to matter.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.80 There was no need for me to know nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts
00:29:49.80 --> 00:29:53.72 and the image of my beloved.
00:29:53.72 --> 00:29:58.04 Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I still would have given myself
00:29:58.04 --> 00:30:02.56 undisturbed by that knowledge to the contemplation of her image.
00:30:02.56 --> 00:30:12.76 That my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying.
00:30:12.76 --> 00:30:28.000 Set me like a seal upon my heart, love is as strong as death.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.08 And continuing on, Dr. Frankle talks about images from inside the camp.
00:30:37.08 --> 00:30:41.04 Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with
00:30:41.04 --> 00:30:47.12 clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors from steel blue to blood red.
00:30:47.12 --> 00:30:53.04 The desolate gray mud huts provided a sharp contrast while the puddles on the muddy ground
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:57.36 reflected the glowing sky.
00:30:57.36 --> 00:31:02.96 And then after a few minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, how beautiful
00:31:02.96 --> 00:31:08.88 the world could be.
00:31:08.88 --> 00:31:18.84 And beyond looking for beauty around them, they were able to find humor.
00:31:18.84 --> 00:31:23.64 And I have people ask me about this from time to time about humor and combat situations
00:31:23.64 --> 00:31:29.64 and isn't it important and yes it absolutely is, and you'd think in a concentration camp
00:31:29.64 --> 00:31:35.16 even humor would go away.
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:39.84 But not true, back to the book to discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:42.88 camp must be surprising enough for an outsider.
00:31:42.88 --> 00:31:49.16 But he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor.
00:31:49.16 --> 00:31:53.36 And if I'm not able to find a sense of humor there as well, of course only the faint trace
00:31:53.36 --> 00:31:54.36 of one.
00:31:54.36 --> 00:31:59.48 And then only for a few seconds or minutes, humor was another of the soul's weapons in the
00:31:59.48 --> 00:32:03.40 fight for self preservation.
00:32:03.40 --> 00:32:08.64 It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human makeup, can afford an
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:16.68 aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation if only for a few seconds.
00:32:16.68 --> 00:32:21.16 The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:26.76 of trick I learned while mastering the art of living.
00:32:26.76 --> 00:32:31.40 Yet it is impossible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp although
00:32:31.40 --> 00:32:34.44 suffering is omnipresent.
00:32:34.44 --> 00:32:40.52 To draw an analogy, a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas.
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:45.60 If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:50.000 and evenly no matter how big the chamber.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.44 Thus, suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind no matter whether the
00:32:55.44 --> 00:32:59.52 suffering is great or little.
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:08.16 Therefore the size of human suffering is absolutely relative.
00:33:08.16 --> 00:33:14.08 And I think the point that I took away from that was that chamber that can be filled up
00:33:14.08 --> 00:33:18.24 with suffering filled up with some humor as well.
00:33:18.24 --> 00:33:27.000 Otherwise that suffering will just fill the whole chamber, fill your whole brain.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.04 Back to the book, we were grateful for the smallest of mercies.
00:33:30.04 --> 00:33:35.48 We were glad when there was time to delouse before going to bed.
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:40.24 Although in itself this was no pressure as it meant standing naked and unheated
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:44.80 hut where icicles hung from the ceiling.
00:33:44.80 --> 00:33:49.68 But we were thankful if there was no air raid alarm during this operation in the lights
00:33:49.68 --> 00:33:52.36 were not switched off.
00:33:52.36 --> 00:33:54.80 We could not do the job properly.
00:33:54.80 --> 00:34:04.48 We were kept awake half the night.
00:34:04.48 --> 00:34:10.64 So you're at a point in life where you're grateful for being able to stand naked and pick
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:15.60 the lights off of your friends before you go to bed so that the lights won't keep you awake
00:34:15.60 --> 00:34:23.76 at night by chewing at your body.
00:34:23.76 --> 00:34:31.60 And you know I talked about how or he talks about how it was the person that was going
00:34:31.60 --> 00:34:36.24 to survive had to be ruthless basically.
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:40.36 And here he says, but is not for me to pass judgment on those prisoners who put their own
00:34:40.36 --> 00:34:42.76 people above everyone else.
00:34:42.76 --> 00:34:46.64 Who controls snowen in a man who favors his friends under circumstances when sooner
00:34:46.64 --> 00:34:50.60 later it is a question of life or death.
00:34:50.60 --> 00:34:56.64 No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation
00:34:56.64 --> 00:35:06.64 he might not have done the same.
00:35:06.64 --> 00:35:11.64 And here he says, I mentioned earlier how everything that was not connected with the immediate
00:35:11.64 --> 00:35:18.72 task of keeping oneself in one closest friends of lives lost its value.
00:35:18.72 --> 00:35:22.76 Everything was sacrificed to this end.
00:35:22.76 --> 00:35:29.28 The man's character became involved to the point that he was caught in mental turmoil which
00:35:29.28 --> 00:35:33.88 threatened all values he held and threw them into doubt.
00:35:33.88 --> 00:35:38.52 Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human
00:35:38.52 --> 00:35:44.68 dignity which had robbed the man of his will and made him an object to be exterminated,
00:35:44.68 --> 00:35:48.76 having planned however to make full use of him first to the last ounce of his physical
00:35:48.76 --> 00:35:56.92 resources under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values.
00:35:56.92 --> 00:36:01.92 If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:10.24 save his self respect he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind
00:36:10.24 --> 00:36:16.52 with inner freedom and personal value.
00:36:16.52 --> 00:36:23.12 He thought of himself then as only part of an enormous mass of people his existence descended
00:36:23.12 --> 00:36:28.20 to the level of animal life.
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:32.80 The men were herded sometimes to one place then to another sometimes driven together
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:39.80 than a part like a flock of sheep without a thought or a will of their own.
00:36:39.80 --> 00:36:45.000 A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides well versed in methods of torture
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.84 and sadism.
00:36:47.84 --> 00:36:54.72 They drove the herd and sessingly backwards and forwards with shouts kicks and blows and
00:36:54.72 --> 00:37:00.32 we the sheep thought of two things only.
00:37:00.32 --> 00:37:15.44 How to evade the bad dogs and how to get a little food.
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:23.92 He's going to delve into this deeper, this idea of this inner freedom and how hard you
00:37:23.92 --> 00:37:30.24 had to fight to maintain that and how easy it was just to roll in and become one of the
00:37:30.24 --> 00:37:36.40 pack one of the herd.
00:37:36.40 --> 00:37:40.96 Back to the book, it is very difficult for an outsider to grasp how very little value
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:44.92 was placed on human life and camp.
00:37:44.92 --> 00:37:52.64 The camp inmate was hardened, possibly became more conscious of this complete disregard
00:37:52.64 --> 00:37:58.76 of human existence when a convoy of sick men was arranged.
00:37:58.76 --> 00:38:04.36 The initiated bodies of the sick were thrown on two wheeled carts which were drawn by prisoners
00:38:04.36 --> 00:38:09.56 for many miles, often through snowstorms to the next camp.
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:14.92 If one of the sick men had died before the cart left, he was thrown on anyways.
00:38:14.92 --> 00:38:21.88 The list had to be correct, but the list was the only thing that mattered.
00:38:21.88 --> 00:38:26.04 A man counted only because he had a prison number.
00:38:26.04 --> 00:38:32.32 One literally became a number, dead or alive, that was unimportant.
00:38:32.32 --> 00:38:36.52 The life of a number was completely irrelevant.
00:38:36.52 --> 00:38:41.84 What stood behind that number and that life mattered even less.
00:38:41.84 --> 00:38:57.92 The fate, the history, the name of the man.
00:38:57.92 --> 00:39:03.24 The camp inmate was frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative
00:39:03.24 --> 00:39:06.24 whatsoever.
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:11.40 This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one's master and that one must
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:19.56 not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course.
00:39:19.56 --> 00:39:26.04 In addition, there was a great apathy which contributed no small part to the feelings
00:39:26.04 --> 00:39:28.68 of the prisoner.
00:39:28.68 --> 00:39:34.08 At times, lightning decisions had to be made.
00:39:34.08 --> 00:39:37.08 Decisions with spelled life or death.
00:39:37.08 --> 00:39:44.04 The prisoner would have preferred to let fate make the choice for him.
00:39:44.04 --> 00:39:48.80 Some of the examples that he brings up in the book on that are, they'd get told, we need
00:39:48.80 --> 00:39:54.04 people to go to a different camp for rest.
00:39:54.04 --> 00:39:55.64 They had no idea.
00:39:55.64 --> 00:39:56.64 Sometimes it actually was.
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:01.92 Sometimes it was some kind of actual medical facility.
00:40:01.92 --> 00:40:05.28 Sometimes it was just you're going to the gas chambers at another camp and they had no
00:40:05.28 --> 00:40:07.68 idea which one it was.
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:12.28 They got into this mode of they were just going to externally just whatever was going
00:40:12.28 --> 00:40:13.28 to happen.
00:40:13.28 --> 00:40:20.36 They go beyond when they're trying to begin to get me off that list or I want to be on that
00:40:20.36 --> 00:40:24.20 list and they realize that they were messing with fate.
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:31.96 They got into a mode of, I'm just going to let things happen and whatever happens happens.
00:40:31.96 --> 00:40:36.36 You get this feeling of apathy.
00:40:36.36 --> 00:40:42.36 You can just imagine how that, that having no control externally of what's happening, how
00:40:42.36 --> 00:40:43.76 that leads.
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:48.12 Number one leads to this apathy of just I don't care what happens.
00:40:48.12 --> 00:40:53.48 But number two, how that can then sneak in and start to get control of your inner
00:40:53.48 --> 00:40:56.56 thoughts and your inner feelings where you just feel like you don't have control over
00:40:56.56 --> 00:40:58.68 anything in life and that's it.
00:40:58.68 --> 00:41:01.72 And here he talks about apathy some more.
00:41:01.72 --> 00:41:07.88 The prisoners apathy was also the result of other factors, hunger and lack of sleep contributed
00:41:07.88 --> 00:41:13.000 to it as they do in normal life also.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.44 And to the general irritability which was another characteristic of the prisoner's mental
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:19.20 state.
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:23.04 The lack of sleep was partly due to the pestering of vermin which infested the terribly
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:29.36 overcrowded huts because of the general lack of hygiene and sanitation.
00:41:29.36 --> 00:41:34.20 The fact that we had neither nicotine nor caffeine also contributed to the state of apathy
00:41:34.20 --> 00:41:37.12 and irritability.
00:41:37.12 --> 00:41:41.04 Besides these physical causes, there were mental ones.
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:46.36 In the form of certain complexes, the majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority
00:41:46.36 --> 00:41:48.16 complex.
00:41:48.16 --> 00:41:53.76 We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be somebody.
00:41:53.76 --> 00:42:00.04 Now we were treated like complete non-entities.
00:42:00.04 --> 00:42:05.32 The consciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things.
00:42:05.32 --> 00:42:08.24 It cannot be shaken by camp life.
00:42:08.24 --> 00:42:14.28 But how many free men load alone prisoners possess it?
00:42:14.28 --> 00:42:21.04 Without consciously thinking about it, the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded.
00:42:21.04 --> 00:42:26.80 This became obvious when one observed the contrasts offered by the singular sociological
00:42:26.80 --> 00:42:28.52 structure of the camp.
00:42:28.52 --> 00:42:34.44 The more prominent prisoners, the capos, the cooks, the storekeepers and the camp policemen
00:42:34.44 --> 00:42:38.08 did not as a rule field degraded at all.
00:42:38.08 --> 00:42:44.04 Like the majority of prisoners, but on the contrary, they felt promoted.
00:42:44.04 --> 00:42:52.76 They even developed miniature delusions of grandeur.
00:42:52.76 --> 00:42:56.12 Clearly we can all take a lesson out of that one.
00:42:56.12 --> 00:43:01.000 That is, you know, you get put into a promotion position or you've got authority over
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000 people.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.76 Don't let that go to your head.
00:43:03.76 --> 00:43:10.60 Yeah, I guess that's a natural thing where they did this experiment test in the university
00:43:10.60 --> 00:43:11.60 whatever.
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:15.60 Just from random students, one played the prisoner, one group played the guards and that
00:43:15.60 --> 00:43:16.60 happened.
00:43:16.60 --> 00:43:19.44 You know, like an actor, it's just an experiment.
00:43:19.44 --> 00:43:21.96 It's not real life, you know, it's still happened.
00:43:21.96 --> 00:43:26.08 Yeah, and it happened in real life, which I think is even more insane.
00:43:26.08 --> 00:43:28.52 See, even more insane.
00:43:28.52 --> 00:43:31.40 Yeah, and away, huh.
00:43:31.40 --> 00:43:39.08 But then again, how can we sit here in judge when if you're in that situation and you need
00:43:39.08 --> 00:43:43.64 to survive and you need to do the best to get you to survive in your family survive?
00:43:43.64 --> 00:43:47.12 And you have an opportunity, oh, are we going to say nope?
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:48.12 Nope.
00:43:48.12 --> 00:43:52.92 I'm going to instead of doing this where I maybe can do something good in the long run.
00:43:52.92 --> 00:43:53.92 Nope.
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:55.56 I'm not going to go across my values.
00:43:55.56 --> 00:43:57.60 I'm going to die in three days and that's it.
00:43:57.60 --> 00:43:58.60 Yeah.
00:43:58.60 --> 00:44:00.24 That's a hard decision to make.
00:44:00.24 --> 00:44:04.88 Yeah, I mean, it seems easy when you're sitting in the comfort of your home.
00:44:04.88 --> 00:44:09.60 Like, I wouldn't do that or, you know, and this is what I would have done or I wouldn't
00:44:09.60 --> 00:44:10.60 have done.
00:44:10.60 --> 00:44:16.88 But yeah, you know, I, I, I, I talked to people about again, it's I'm not going to compare
00:44:16.88 --> 00:44:21.88 anything to what we're talking about here, but in the military, for instance, a lot of
00:44:21.88 --> 00:44:27.80 times I had to make decisions to, to, to, you know, I got to do something that maybe
00:44:27.80 --> 00:44:32.52 I didn't fully agree with, but I knew in the long run, it was going to get me something
00:44:32.52 --> 00:44:36.32 that it was going to be beneficial to my team or to my platoon or whatever.
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:37.32 Yeah.
00:44:37.32 --> 00:44:40.60 So you make those little adjustments and you got to suck it up and you do something that
00:44:40.60 --> 00:44:44.44 you might not want to do, but in the long run, it's going to be beneficial.
00:44:44.44 --> 00:44:45.44 Yeah.
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:50.96 I mean, this, I, I don't even know if this is even a remotely close comparison.
00:44:50.96 --> 00:44:55.84 But what I am saying is this, you take a human being and you say, look, you can either
00:44:55.84 --> 00:45:00.48 step up and act a different way and be abusive to these people or you're going to be dead
00:45:00.48 --> 00:45:01.48 in three days.
00:45:01.48 --> 00:45:02.48 That's it.
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:03.48 Those are your choices.
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:04.48 Yeah.
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:07.84 And it's not that hard to figure out that a lot of people are going to step up and say,
00:45:07.84 --> 00:45:11.44 cool, all of you, those people because I need to live, need to live.
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.44 Yeah.
00:45:12.44 --> 00:45:13.44 My choices either death.
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:14.44 Yeah.
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:19.24 And by the way, maybe the, maybe the the best person in that group is going to say, you
00:45:19.24 --> 00:45:24.04 know what, I'm going to do this and I'm going to step up and when I abuse these people,
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:26.72 I'm going to do a little bit less than someone else might.
00:45:26.72 --> 00:45:28.48 And therefore, I'm doing the best I can.
00:45:28.48 --> 00:45:29.48 Yeah.
00:45:29.48 --> 00:45:31.48 I mean, these are decisions.
00:45:31.48 --> 00:45:33.48 How do you even think about these decisions?
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:34.48 Yeah.
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:35.48 No, man.
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:36.48 And you have to think about it.
00:45:36.48 --> 00:45:40.68 You have to understand, you have to understand what human nature is that there is a survival
00:45:40.68 --> 00:45:42.16 point for humans.
00:45:42.16 --> 00:45:46.48 You have an instinct to survive that very few people can overcome.
00:45:46.48 --> 00:45:48.84 Yeah.
00:45:48.84 --> 00:45:54.72 And I don't even, you know, again, how do you judge whether it's right to overcome it or not?
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:55.72 When is it right?
00:45:55.72 --> 00:45:57.36 I mean, obviously, when is it right?
00:45:57.36 --> 00:45:58.36 We're sitting here.
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:01.56 You say, hey, don't, you know, these guys, why would you kill yourself?
00:46:01.56 --> 00:46:05.36 Well, if you don't do these things, you're basically killing yourself.
00:46:05.36 --> 00:46:10.12 If you don't step up, if you don't say, okay, I'll work as a capo.
00:46:10.12 --> 00:46:11.60 If you don't do that, you're killing yourself.
00:46:11.60 --> 00:46:12.60 Right.
00:46:12.60 --> 00:46:13.60 Is that make it okay?
00:46:13.60 --> 00:46:14.60 Man.
00:46:14.60 --> 00:46:15.60 Yeah.
00:46:15.60 --> 00:46:16.60 It's brutal.
00:46:16.60 --> 00:46:19.88 It's like you got to figure out whether or not you're better off dead in the, even in the grand scheme
00:46:19.88 --> 00:46:20.88 of things.
00:46:20.88 --> 00:46:25.68 Like these, these people that they're going to kind of succumb to these positions or do all these
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:31.44 low things to survive, so they can survive and you don't live on and all this stuff.
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:35.52 So it's either that or am I better off dead overall.
00:46:35.52 --> 00:46:37.84 You know, like that's the decision you got to make.
00:46:37.84 --> 00:46:38.84 Tank.
00:46:38.84 --> 00:46:42.04 Who knows what you think, especially with all these conditions?
00:46:42.04 --> 00:46:43.04 Yeah.
00:46:43.04 --> 00:46:46.72 You know, the opposite of that was Dick Winners was talking about how he had, and I don't
00:46:46.72 --> 00:46:52.28 know if I talked about it on the podcast, but in the book conversations with Dick Winners,
00:46:52.28 --> 00:46:55.64 you go through a big section where he talks about some of the guys and his
00:46:55.64 --> 00:46:56.64 company.
00:46:56.64 --> 00:47:00.80 And he called him the killers and he actually went on and said, hey, you know, I don't
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:04.92 want to call him killers because that's going to give the wrong impression.
00:47:04.92 --> 00:47:07.04 But these guys were my most aggressive guys.
00:47:07.04 --> 00:47:09.08 They were my best guys.
00:47:09.08 --> 00:47:12.20 And he said, they didn't make it past.
00:47:12.20 --> 00:47:13.72 You know, he said, most of them didn't make it.
00:47:13.72 --> 00:47:18.000 I forget which, which battle, but he said, most of them didn't make it past this certain
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.28 time because they were so aggressive.
00:47:20.28 --> 00:47:27.56 They were such good guys. They were so brave that they didn't make it.
00:47:27.56 --> 00:47:31.68 And this is sort of the opposite where you have the people that are brave.
00:47:31.68 --> 00:47:34.96 I guess no, it's the same in that people that are brave and going to hold their values.
00:47:34.96 --> 00:47:35.96 They're going to die.
00:47:35.96 --> 00:47:36.96 Right.
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:42.72 And if you think about somebody that's cowardly in combat, that says, oh, you know, what,
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:43.88 you know, echo you go first.
00:47:43.88 --> 00:47:47.76 I'm going to sit over here behind this, you know, covered position.
00:47:47.76 --> 00:47:48.76 Yeah.
00:47:48.76 --> 00:47:53.76 And it's a micro example of what we're talking about here.
00:47:53.76 --> 00:47:54.76 Yeah.
00:47:54.76 --> 00:47:55.76 Yeah.
00:47:55.76 --> 00:48:01.48 And this, this, given the book in what we're talking about, it might come off as borderline
00:48:01.48 --> 00:48:04.28 insulting, if not full fledged insulting.
00:48:04.28 --> 00:48:06.28 But you ever watched this show survivor?
00:48:06.28 --> 00:48:09.28 I, I, I, I was the first one when it was kind of a thing.
00:48:09.28 --> 00:48:10.28 Yeah.
00:48:10.28 --> 00:48:12.28 And it was an interesting psychology happening.
00:48:12.28 --> 00:48:13.28 Yeah.
00:48:13.28 --> 00:48:15.52 And that's like a lot of this Rudy Bosch was on it.
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:18.32 You know, this, see, retired seal map.
00:48:18.32 --> 00:48:19.32 Yeah.
00:48:19.32 --> 00:48:21.32 And it's like, you know, everyone kind of knew in the seal teams.
00:48:21.32 --> 00:48:22.32 Okay.
00:48:22.32 --> 00:48:23.32 Yeah.
00:48:23.32 --> 00:48:27.52 So, especially when you're going to say is that the, the people that are not good human
00:48:27.52 --> 00:48:29.32 beings are the ones that went a lot.
00:48:29.32 --> 00:48:33.64 Well, they get far put it that way because they have this weird mechanism at the end,
00:48:33.64 --> 00:48:38.28 where the last, you know, few people who get voted off, they become this sort of a jury.
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:41.92 So it's like if you went through the whole game, screwing people over, the jury's going
00:48:41.92 --> 00:48:43.16 to get you kind of thing.
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:44.16 So it's a, yeah.
00:48:44.16 --> 00:48:48.04 And this is just how the show just sorted itself out over time.
00:48:48.04 --> 00:48:49.60 But the first ones didn't have any jury, right?
00:48:49.60 --> 00:48:50.60 I don't, I don't know.
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:51.60 I don't know.
00:48:51.60 --> 00:48:52.60 I don't know.
00:48:52.60 --> 00:48:57.12 I'm going to go ahead and say, I'm almost positive they didn't because Rudy had his
00:48:57.12 --> 00:49:01.92 hand on some log and they had to keep it there for like X and for a whole time.
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:05.68 And one person, you know, he actually, he like fought us on something else and took his
00:49:05.68 --> 00:49:06.68 hand off and then he was out.
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:07.68 That was it.
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:08.68 Okay.
00:49:08.68 --> 00:49:10.68 But yeah, there's absolute comparison there.
00:49:10.68 --> 00:49:17.48 There's an absolute comparison to, you know, if you're willing to be a snake, right,
00:49:17.48 --> 00:49:20.24 you can, and you can, you can win the game.
00:49:20.24 --> 00:49:22.40 And I've talked about that to in promotion.
00:49:22.40 --> 00:49:23.80 People getting promoted.
00:49:23.80 --> 00:49:27.44 And if you're willing to be a snake, you can get promoted.
00:49:27.44 --> 00:49:32.92 But the thing that I will say in a work environment is that that snake might get one
00:49:32.92 --> 00:49:33.92 promotion.
00:49:33.92 --> 00:49:35.60 They might get two promotions.
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:36.92 They're not going to go to the distance.
00:49:36.92 --> 00:49:43.48 And if you hold the line on doing what's correct, then you might miss that first
00:49:43.48 --> 00:49:44.48 promotion.
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:45.92 You might even miss that second promotion.
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:50.04 And eventually, if you're on the right path, you will get the recognition and you will
00:49:50.04 --> 00:49:51.28 win in the long run.
00:49:51.28 --> 00:49:52.60 You've got to be patient though.
00:49:52.60 --> 00:49:53.60 Yeah.
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:54.60 Yeah.
00:49:54.60 --> 00:49:58.08 I mean, obviously in your job, it's not life or death.
00:49:58.08 --> 00:50:01.40 You know, death isn't so close that, you know, one slip up your death.
00:50:01.40 --> 00:50:02.40 You're dead.
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:06.24 So that's, you know, obviously the dynamics are different in work in that way.
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:08.16 But otherwise, I think so.
00:50:08.16 --> 00:50:12.44 And survivor, there's also that other thing that kind of, what they talked about where or
00:50:12.44 --> 00:50:14.88 what you're just talking about is.
00:50:14.88 --> 00:50:19.76 If you, it's kind of, in a matter of speaking, playing at safe where you're just hiding
00:50:19.76 --> 00:50:25.28 under the wing, you might attach yourself to someone or you'll avoid any kind of, you
00:50:25.28 --> 00:50:32.04 know, risky, persuasion, and so in survivor, you can make it far like that as well.
00:50:32.04 --> 00:50:34.28 And nowadays, everyone knows about those things.
00:50:34.28 --> 00:50:35.64 Like, oh, you backstabbed everyone.
00:50:35.64 --> 00:50:40.08 Or you just hid behind this guy because he's strong by the same time, just like how you're
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:44.44 saying, if you're brave or you're going to stick to your morals and be honest with everyone,
00:50:44.44 --> 00:50:45.92 you'll get voted off real quick.
00:50:45.92 --> 00:50:50.52 Even if you're really good at, you know, the challenges, but don't even really good leaders
00:50:50.52 --> 00:50:51.52 get voted.
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:53.20 Like if someone just does a dynamic, they go to the office.
00:50:53.20 --> 00:50:54.20 That would be right.
00:50:54.20 --> 00:50:55.20 Yeah, yeah, see you later.
00:50:55.20 --> 00:50:57.20 Too much of a threat to everybody else.
00:50:57.20 --> 00:51:00.16 And actually what you're talking about going through seal training, I would hear it.
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:02.52 And it was, I didn't hear it when I went through.
00:51:02.52 --> 00:51:05.20 But I heard it later, this idea of the gray man.
00:51:05.20 --> 00:51:08.96 And I think we might have actually answered a question on the podcast about that was going
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:11.80 through training and just being a gray man, meaning just don't stand out.
00:51:11.80 --> 00:51:12.80 Right.
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:13.80 That's the other.
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:15.56 And you'll be good to go.
00:51:15.56 --> 00:51:18.32 And that's a strategy.
00:51:18.32 --> 00:51:19.32 That's a strategy.
00:51:19.32 --> 00:51:20.32 Right.
00:51:20.32 --> 00:51:24.68 And the seal team is a strategy going through buds through seal training, the initial seal
00:51:24.68 --> 00:51:25.68 training course.
00:51:25.68 --> 00:51:28.40 Because the many you stand out, people start knowing who you are.
00:51:28.40 --> 00:51:31.44 And now you got instructors looking at you and the more they watch you, the more they can
00:51:31.44 --> 00:51:35.64 see, maybe you're making some mistakes or maybe you're not doing everything right or maybe
00:51:35.64 --> 00:51:36.64 you're not.
00:51:36.64 --> 00:51:38.72 And so it's better just to be that guy in the middle.
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:41.84 I was the guy in the middle, not because I wanted to be.
00:51:41.84 --> 00:51:46.04 Because I was not, you know, the fastest runner I wasn't the best runner.
00:51:46.04 --> 00:51:48.08 What you don't want to be is the guy on the tail end.
00:51:48.08 --> 00:51:49.08 Right.
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:52.48 And it's weird because I put so many guys not through the basic seal training, but through
00:51:52.48 --> 00:51:54.40 the advanced seal training.
00:51:54.40 --> 00:51:57.36 And the guys that I remember, there's two types of guys that I remember, the guys that
00:51:57.36 --> 00:51:59.36 were awesome and the guys that were horrible.
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:02.96 And the guys in the middle, all the gray guys, I know them when I see them, but a lot
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:04.32 of times I know 100%.
00:52:04.32 --> 00:52:06.28 I might not know their name.
00:52:06.28 --> 00:52:10.68 Whereas some of the pipeters, the young pipeters, some E5 pipeter that was just getting
00:52:10.68 --> 00:52:11.68 after it.
00:52:11.68 --> 00:52:13.96 I always remember those guys names because they would take control of everything.
00:52:13.96 --> 00:52:14.96 And they'd stand out.
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:18.36 And then the other guys you remember, a guy that are totally jacked up.
00:52:18.36 --> 00:52:23.84 So that idea of being a gray man, it seems like a good policy to have in the concentration
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:24.84 cap.
00:52:24.84 --> 00:52:25.84 Look, I just don't want to stand out.
00:52:25.84 --> 00:52:26.84 I don't want to have a limp.
00:52:26.84 --> 00:52:31.44 I don't want to, you know, come across as I just want to fit in in the gray man.
00:52:31.44 --> 00:52:35.04 Unless you're going to go the distance, right?
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:39.76 Which is, and that's a horrible way of saying, I'm going to stand out by saying, hey,
00:52:39.76 --> 00:52:42.52 I can whip these prisoners into shape.
00:52:42.52 --> 00:52:45.64 That's going and raising your hand and saying, I'll be a capo.
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:50.20 I'm going to step up and what you're risking there is we don't know where this war is
00:52:50.20 --> 00:52:53.64 going to end and where you're going to be at the end of this thing.
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:55.68 And I read some stories about that.
00:52:55.68 --> 00:52:57.28 The war didn't.
00:52:57.28 --> 00:52:59.52 And they did liberate these camps.
00:52:59.52 --> 00:53:00.68 And it didn't work out.
00:53:00.68 --> 00:53:04.16 Good for the capos.
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:06.52 So there's the same thing.
00:53:06.52 --> 00:53:11.96 You might have done all right, getting your promotion the first couple of times, but eventually
00:53:11.96 --> 00:53:12.96 it comes around.
00:53:12.96 --> 00:53:15.16 Yeah, exactly right.
00:53:15.16 --> 00:53:17.56 You know, hardly flanagan was talking about karma.
00:53:17.56 --> 00:53:20.08 And I don't know how much reality there is to that.
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:24.12 But there's the reality of you reap what you sow.
00:53:24.12 --> 00:53:25.12 Yeah.
00:53:25.12 --> 00:53:29.80 And if you treat people, if you take advantage of your position, if you maneuver and
00:53:29.80 --> 00:53:32.76 screw people over to get ahead of them, they'll remember that.
00:53:32.76 --> 00:53:33.76 Yeah.
00:53:33.76 --> 00:53:34.76 They'll remember that.
00:53:34.76 --> 00:53:35.76 Yeah.
00:53:35.76 --> 00:53:36.76 And karma with you.
00:53:36.76 --> 00:53:39.000 And it's never worth it, by the way.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000 It's almost never worth it.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.24 I mean, could you possibly come up with some scenario where, you know, I did this to get
00:53:47.24 --> 00:53:48.24 a promotion.
00:53:48.24 --> 00:53:49.84 So that I could take care of you and everyone else.
00:53:49.84 --> 00:53:50.84 You could come up with this.
00:53:50.84 --> 00:53:52.96 Yeah, but it's very, very rare.
00:53:52.96 --> 00:53:57.12 And my gut feeling was always like it's not worth it.
00:53:57.12 --> 00:54:03.36 It's not worth it to do those little maneuvers and try and better your position on other
00:54:03.36 --> 00:54:04.80 people's backs.
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:05.80 Yeah.
00:54:05.80 --> 00:54:06.80 We're screwing someone over in.
00:54:06.80 --> 00:54:07.80 Because you've got to live with that too.
00:54:07.80 --> 00:54:11.24 I mean, unless you're like a sociopath or something like that, you have to live with
00:54:11.24 --> 00:54:12.24 that.
00:54:12.24 --> 00:54:14.60 And man, yeah.
00:54:14.60 --> 00:54:17.16 And even at the time, it seems like, oh, I could live with that.
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:18.16 Cause, oh, look at what?
00:54:18.16 --> 00:54:21.28 You're actually, you're actually taking a higher road than me.
00:54:21.28 --> 00:54:23.44 Because you're saying you personally have to live with it.
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:26.64 And that's definitely, I'm saying beyond that, even if you're a person that can live with
00:54:26.64 --> 00:54:29.12 it, you're still going to pay in a long run.
00:54:29.12 --> 00:54:31.64 Even if you look yourself in the mirror, but like, I don't care, I got promoted.
00:54:31.64 --> 00:54:32.64 It's good.
00:54:32.64 --> 00:54:33.64 That's, that's, okay.
00:54:33.64 --> 00:54:34.64 So you can live with that.
00:54:34.64 --> 00:54:35.64 That's cool.
00:54:35.64 --> 00:54:38.60 But guess what, there's something else you're going to, that's going to come back around.
00:54:38.60 --> 00:54:43.16 And that is one of those other people that you stepped on their back is going to invent
00:54:43.16 --> 00:54:44.16 something new at work.
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:46.44 And he's going to take over the division and you're going to pay.
00:54:46.44 --> 00:54:48.88 Not to mention the 10 people who watched it happen.
00:54:48.88 --> 00:54:49.88 Yeah.
00:54:49.88 --> 00:54:50.88 You know, yeah.
00:54:50.88 --> 00:54:51.88 You're just making enemies.
00:54:51.88 --> 00:54:52.88 Yeah.
00:54:52.88 --> 00:54:53.88 enemies.
00:54:53.88 --> 00:54:55.88 And that's really what Karma is for.
00:54:55.88 --> 00:54:59.52 I mean, karma could be this mystical thing that personally watches you and has this
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:00.52 judgment system.
00:55:00.52 --> 00:55:02.04 But you can just be real.
00:55:02.04 --> 00:55:03.04 Just real life.
00:55:03.04 --> 00:55:05.56 So walk up to, you know, even mean you're even.
00:55:05.56 --> 00:55:06.56 We don't know each other.
00:55:06.56 --> 00:55:08.88 I don't have any bad or good feelings towards you.
00:55:08.88 --> 00:55:10.72 And I come and I slap you.
00:55:10.72 --> 00:55:12.28 I created a deficit now.
00:55:12.28 --> 00:55:13.28 Now you're in 10.
00:55:13.28 --> 00:55:14.28 You're right.
00:55:14.28 --> 00:55:15.56 Big deficit.
00:55:15.56 --> 00:55:16.56 Yeah.
00:55:16.56 --> 00:55:21.48 So you're intention, whether you do it or not, you're, what you, you're compelled
00:55:21.48 --> 00:55:23.20 to slap me back if not more.
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:24.20 Usually more.
00:55:24.20 --> 00:55:25.20 Yeah.
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:26.80 Because, you know, so that's kind of really what it is.
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:28.80 I mean, really in a small teeny tiny nutshell.
00:55:28.80 --> 00:55:29.80 Yeah.
00:55:29.80 --> 00:55:32.24 I go out and start acting mad to everyone.
00:55:32.24 --> 00:55:34.000 They're not going to be like, oh, I love you.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.40 I mean, they might be, you know, intellectual or, you know, they might be
00:55:37.40 --> 00:55:38.72 able to think about it.
00:55:38.72 --> 00:55:42.60 But their natural compulsion will be to be mad at you back.
00:55:42.60 --> 00:55:47.96 And this, you know, the podcast, human nature, talking about human nature.
00:55:47.96 --> 00:55:52.60 And I always say that war reveals human nature more clearly than anything else.
00:55:52.60 --> 00:55:55.16 Because it's so much pressure on the people.
00:55:55.16 --> 00:55:58.88 Obviously a concentration camp, it's revealing human nature.
00:55:58.88 --> 00:56:00.92 And that's exactly what we're talking about.
00:56:00.92 --> 00:56:07.68 And it reveals itself in crystal clarity on a massive scale in terms of being able to
00:56:07.68 --> 00:56:09.64 see it in a concentration camp.
00:56:09.64 --> 00:56:13.16 And you see it reveal itself on a TV show called survivor.
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:16.92 And you see it reveal itself in the work environment.
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:22.44 And what I'm saying is, from all that, what you want to do is you want to make sure that
00:56:22.44 --> 00:56:26.12 when you get put into a position of authority, you don't abuse it.
00:56:26.12 --> 00:56:27.68 That's what I'm saying.
00:56:27.68 --> 00:56:33.12 You don't want to abuse it. You want to treat people with respect no matter what.
00:56:33.12 --> 00:56:38.24 And you don't want to step on people's backs to get ahead because ultimately it's not
00:56:38.24 --> 00:56:39.60 going to pay off.
00:56:39.60 --> 00:56:40.84 It really isn't.
00:56:40.84 --> 00:56:41.84 Yeah.
00:56:41.84 --> 00:56:43.24 You're only going to fool.
00:56:43.24 --> 00:56:47.04 Like that leader that you, that you fooled and thinking that you are a great guy.
00:56:47.04 --> 00:56:49.16 That's only going to last for so long.
00:56:49.16 --> 00:56:53.20 And eventually you're going to get found out.
00:56:53.20 --> 00:57:01.24 Now, all right, let's get back into the book here.
00:57:01.24 --> 00:57:07.28 The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:09.72 And this is we've talked about the capitals and he's going to talk about some of the
00:57:09.72 --> 00:57:14.52 more heroic people and some of those actions very briefly.
00:57:14.52 --> 00:57:20.16 And he says because it's the reason there's very briefly because there wasn't a lot of them.
00:57:20.16 --> 00:57:23.92 The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:30.48 There were enough examples often of a heroic nature which proved that apathy could be overcome
00:57:30.48 --> 00:57:34.40 irritability, irritability suppressed.
00:57:34.40 --> 00:57:39.20 Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom.
00:57:39.20 --> 00:57:47.76 Of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.
00:57:47.76 --> 00:57:54.76 We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts, comforting
00:57:54.76 --> 00:57:59.76 others, giving away their last piece of bread.
00:57:59.76 --> 00:58:06.20 They may have been few and number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:09.64 from a man but one thing.
00:58:09.64 --> 00:58:18.96 The last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:22.12 to choose one's own way.
00:58:22.12 --> 00:58:23.44 And there it is.
00:58:23.44 --> 00:58:26.36 I mean that is it.
00:58:26.36 --> 00:58:27.84 That is it.
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:36.000 This idea and captain plumb talked about it as well and captain plumb had a quote from Stockdale.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.24 We got to explore this and I've got a bunch of stockdale books and we will get to some
00:58:40.24 --> 00:58:41.24 stockdale books.
00:58:41.24 --> 00:58:49.52 Who is the senior guy in the Hanau Hillton and he's a fighter pilot philosopher guy, brilliant
00:58:49.52 --> 00:58:50.72 guy in the hero.
00:58:50.72 --> 00:58:56.88 One was awarded the Medal of Honor and one of the things that Captain Plumb was talking
00:58:56.88 --> 00:59:02.84 to us about is Captain Plumb said that they got word from Stockdale and I'm going to misquote
00:59:02.84 --> 00:59:04.52 it by I'm going to do my best.
00:59:04.52 --> 00:59:10.16 It was just because we're in a prison camp doesn't mean we have to be on defense.
00:59:10.16 --> 00:59:11.76 We're going to be on offense.
00:59:11.76 --> 00:59:17.24 In a prison camp, that's just a completely different attitude.
00:59:17.24 --> 00:59:18.60 It's choosing the attitude.
00:59:18.60 --> 00:59:23.60 We're not going to sit here and be abused and be put down.
00:59:23.60 --> 00:59:25.12 We're going to step up.
00:59:25.12 --> 00:59:27.88 We're going to go on offense and they did.
00:59:27.88 --> 00:59:28.88 They did hunger strikes.
00:59:28.88 --> 00:59:29.88 They passed word around.
00:59:29.88 --> 00:59:31.52 They wouldn't stand up when people entered.
00:59:31.52 --> 00:59:35.52 They did these things.
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:38.52 They went on offense.
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:44.96 Human freedom to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:47.04 We always have that choice.
00:59:47.04 --> 00:59:55.16 No matter what the circumstances are that it's around you, always have that choice.
00:59:55.16 --> 00:59:59.20 Back to the book and there will always choices to make.
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:03.32 Every day, every hour offered the opportunity to make a decision.
01:00:03.32 --> 01:00:09.40 A decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which
01:00:09.40 --> 01:00:15.92 threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom.
01:00:15.92 --> 01:00:21.76 Which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance.
01:00:21.76 --> 01:00:28.76 Conceying freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.
01:00:28.76 --> 01:00:36.16 Again, there it is.
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:42.72 You're in a concentration camp, doomed, doomed.
01:00:42.72 --> 01:00:48.72 And yet you can hang on to that last bastion of freedom in your soul.
01:00:48.72 --> 01:00:57.60 To not let them win and not let them own that.
01:00:57.60 --> 01:01:01.20 Back to the book, seen from this point of view the mental reactions of the inmates of
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:06.08 a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical
01:01:06.08 --> 01:01:09.52 and sociological conditions.
01:01:09.52 --> 01:01:14.48 Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses
01:01:14.48 --> 01:01:20.80 may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis,
01:01:20.80 --> 01:01:27.68 it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of inner
01:01:27.68 --> 01:01:36.80 decision and not the result of camp influences alone.
01:01:36.80 --> 01:01:40.16 Think about that.
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:46.24 The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision.
01:01:46.24 --> 01:01:49.52 Not the result of the circumstances here and that doesn't matter what kind of person you
01:01:49.52 --> 01:01:50.88 become.
01:01:50.88 --> 01:01:58.68 What matters is the decisions that you make.
01:01:58.68 --> 01:02:02.04 Unbelievable.
01:02:02.04 --> 01:02:09.20 Back to the book, fundamentally, therefore any man can, even under such circumstances, decide
01:02:09.20 --> 01:02:13.28 what shall become of him mentally and spiritually.
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:14.88 Okay, physically, you can have that one.
01:02:14.88 --> 01:02:26.000 Can't control that all the time, but mentally and spiritually, I get to decide what I'm going to be.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.12 He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.
01:02:33.12 --> 01:02:43.84 Thus the Fsky said, once there is only one thing that I dread not to be worthy of my sufferings.
01:02:43.84 --> 01:02:48.64 These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:56.24 who's behavior in camp, who's suffering and death bore witness to the fact that the last
01:02:56.24 --> 01:03:01.92 inner freedom cannot be lost.
01:03:01.92 --> 01:03:07.20 It can be said that they will worthy of their sufferings.
01:03:07.20 --> 01:03:14.24 The way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement.
01:03:14.24 --> 01:03:22.36 It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away that makes life meaningful and
01:03:22.36 --> 01:03:28.04 purposeful.
01:03:28.04 --> 01:03:34.000 The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.72 he takes up his cross gives him ample opportunity, even under the most difficult circumstances
01:03:40.72 --> 01:03:44.96 to add a deeper meaning to his life.
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:53.28 It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation,
01:03:53.28 --> 01:03:59.000 he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.68 Heurlies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forego the opportunities of
01:04:04.68 --> 01:04:12.96 attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him.
01:04:12.96 --> 01:04:18.52 And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
01:04:18.52 --> 01:04:26.48 So think about that, when you get faced with this ultimate challenge, brutal challenge,
01:04:26.48 --> 01:04:34.24 when life is just about to crush you, that's when you have the biggest opportunity to
01:04:34.24 --> 01:04:38.04 prove who you are.
01:04:38.04 --> 01:04:47.12 Speaking of unworthy topics, but this is something I, when I was, when I first got to see
01:04:47.12 --> 01:04:52.36 what was at Silti-Mond, I ran a communications class.
01:04:52.36 --> 01:04:56.20 When I ran the class, I was super hard.
01:04:56.20 --> 01:04:57.84 I know it comes as a big shocker.
01:04:57.84 --> 01:05:02.04 But we would test, test, test on all these different subjects.
01:05:02.04 --> 01:05:09.20 What radio, what frequency you ran with, what all these different subjects.
01:05:09.20 --> 01:05:13.32 I would say the guys, hey, tomorrow we got another test, another opportunity for you to
01:05:13.32 --> 01:05:15.92 prove yourself.
01:05:15.92 --> 01:05:17.48 That's the way I looked at it.
01:05:17.48 --> 01:05:18.80 They didn't always look at it the same way.
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:21.52 But that's exactly what he's saying here.
01:05:21.52 --> 01:05:28.32 When you have these brutal circumstances that you face, that's your opportunity.
01:05:28.32 --> 01:05:31.16 And if you think about all heroic tales, right?
01:05:31.16 --> 01:05:35.28 There's no heroic tales where the hero doesn't face any challenges.
01:05:35.28 --> 01:05:39.88 And as a matter of fact, the worst challenge is that he faces the more of a hero he becomes.
01:05:39.88 --> 01:05:42.68 If he rises to the occasion, if he doesn't rise to the occasion, guess what?
01:05:42.68 --> 01:05:43.68 We don't hear about it.
01:05:43.68 --> 01:05:47.80 Not a hero.
01:05:47.80 --> 01:05:52.92 In fact, let's say you're considered a hero.
01:05:52.92 --> 01:06:00.000 And then this big chance to prove yourself comes about and you fail or you don't step up,
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.56 you're kind of like this big failure in a way.
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:04.96 Even though you've been a hero the whole time.
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:07.56 Yeah, I would say that's true.
01:06:07.56 --> 01:06:12.92 Although if you do something heroic enough, people are like good with it.
01:06:12.92 --> 01:06:13.76 I think.
01:06:13.76 --> 01:06:17.56 If they're significant enough, it's kind of the same thing.
01:06:17.56 --> 01:06:24.76 I mean, the bottom line is you face these challenges and you get challenged to have this attitude
01:06:24.76 --> 01:06:30.16 of basically good opportunity to solve the problems.
01:06:30.16 --> 01:06:32.44 Oh, big challenge, cool opportunity.
01:06:32.44 --> 01:06:33.44 Good.
01:06:33.44 --> 01:06:37.24 Yes, like those guys who, they start a business, the business is like,
01:06:37.24 --> 01:06:42.60 grows and then it just massively fails because of some mistake or I don't know something.
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:44.64 Or the kind of out in a whatever.
01:06:44.64 --> 01:06:49.20 And then they reach, rock bottom and they build themselves back up and then it's this massive
01:06:49.20 --> 01:06:50.20 success.
01:06:50.20 --> 01:06:52.20 That's such an impressive story.
01:06:52.20 --> 01:06:56.08 Yeah, you know, that's much better than hey, I went to this school.
01:06:56.08 --> 01:06:57.08 I graduated.
01:06:57.08 --> 01:06:58.56 I worked this job.
01:06:58.56 --> 01:06:59.56 I made a bunch of money.
01:06:59.56 --> 01:07:00.56 Yeah.
01:07:00.56 --> 01:07:01.56 Everyone goes on cool.
01:07:01.56 --> 01:07:02.56 Right?
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:03.56 Cool.
01:07:03.56 --> 01:07:04.56 Yeah, cool.
01:07:04.56 --> 01:07:05.56 They want to hear the struggle.
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:07.56 They want to see that you were challenged.
01:07:07.56 --> 01:07:08.56 Yep.
01:07:08.56 --> 01:07:17.52 Back to the book, everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving
01:07:17.52 --> 01:07:19.84 something through his own suffering.
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:21.64 God, think about that.
01:07:21.64 --> 01:07:29.56 The suffering that you're going through is an a chance to achieve something through your
01:07:29.56 --> 01:07:30.72 suffering.
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:32.000 That's an incredible thought.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000 Yeah.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.52 That's an incredible thought.
01:07:36.52 --> 01:07:43.24 Now, this next part is something that I get asked about on a fairly regular basis.
01:07:43.24 --> 01:07:50.84 Back to the book, take the fate of the sick, especially those who are incurable.
01:07:50.84 --> 01:07:55.24 I once read a letter written by young invalid in which he told a friend that he had just
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:57.76 found out he would not live for long.
01:07:57.76 --> 01:08:00.76 That even an operation would be of no help.
01:08:00.76 --> 01:08:05.40 He wrote further that he remembered a film he had seen in which a man was portrayed
01:08:05.40 --> 01:08:11.32 who waited for death and encouraged and dignified way.
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:13.52 The boy had a thought.
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:18.56 The boy had thought it had great accomplishment to meet death so well.
01:08:18.56 --> 01:08:25.92 Now he wrote, fate was offering him a similar chance.
01:08:25.92 --> 01:08:26.92 Yeah.
01:08:26.92 --> 01:08:35.36 I mean, there's, there's, you know, diseases, terminal diseases.
01:08:35.36 --> 01:08:37.56 And that's it.
01:08:37.56 --> 01:08:39.44 And then what do you do?
01:08:39.44 --> 01:08:45.52 Well, I think you have to choose the best possible attitude you can.
01:08:45.52 --> 01:08:49.44 And again, I've never been in that situation, obviously.
01:08:49.44 --> 01:09:00.000 But that statement seems to be the best possible attitude to take.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.68 Again, that's when we see people doing something heroic.
01:09:04.68 --> 01:09:05.68 That's what we see.
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:10.28 I know it's funny some of those when we were doing a lot of the Native Americans on
01:09:10.28 --> 01:09:11.28 the podcast.
01:09:11.28 --> 01:09:12.48 They all had that attitude.
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:16.12 When you go to face death, hold your head high.
01:09:16.12 --> 01:09:19.24 Be afraid of it.
01:09:19.24 --> 01:09:24.04 And that's really, like you said, it's an easier sitting here in the recording studio.
01:09:24.04 --> 01:09:29.96 And of course, easy for me to sit here and say that.
01:09:29.96 --> 01:09:30.96 But that's a hard one.
01:09:30.96 --> 01:09:39.24 You know, the other day on the Jill Rogan podcast, Everlast was on there.
01:09:39.24 --> 01:09:45.28 And Jill Rogan, you know, Everlast was saying, hey, you know, I'm not in good shape right
01:09:45.28 --> 01:09:46.28 now.
01:09:46.28 --> 01:09:47.52 I wish I could better shape, but I have, you know, bad.
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:49.24 I think he's got a back injury.
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:53.72 And he's got this and he's got a daughter that's got some kind of illness, bad illness.
01:09:53.72 --> 01:09:57.40 And Joe put on the good video that you made.
01:09:57.40 --> 01:10:01.96 And you know, Everlast, when he got done, Everlast was like, hey, that's cool.
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:02.96 That's inspirational.
01:10:02.96 --> 01:10:04.60 But how does that help me with my sick daughter?
01:10:04.60 --> 01:10:05.60 Yeah.
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:06.60 What's good about that?
01:10:06.60 --> 01:10:07.60 You know?
01:10:07.60 --> 01:10:14.32 And I wish I could have jumped through and talked to him because this much I will say, when
01:10:14.32 --> 01:10:20.20 you got a bad situation like that, I'm telling you right now, it could be worse.
01:10:20.20 --> 01:10:23.000 Absolutely a hundred percent.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000 And the fact that he's talking about his daughter and how she's sick and how he has
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.08 to spend so much time with her to take care of her, well, well, that's what I'm saying.
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:31.08 Yeah.
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:33.84 Be thankful that you're in a position in life where you can spend time with her.
01:10:33.84 --> 01:10:37.52 Be thankful that she's in a condition where she can spend time with you.
01:10:37.52 --> 01:10:38.52 Yeah.
01:10:38.52 --> 01:10:41.44 And you know, there's, she's still here.
01:10:41.44 --> 01:10:43.84 If nothing else, that's good.
01:10:43.84 --> 01:10:45.44 If nothing else.
01:10:45.44 --> 01:10:46.44 And so what are you going to do?
01:10:46.44 --> 01:10:50.08 I mean, your, your other option is to say my daughter sick.
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:51.08 This is horrible.
01:10:51.08 --> 01:10:52.08 I got cursed.
01:10:52.08 --> 01:10:54.20 It's, it's not fair.
01:10:54.20 --> 01:10:55.96 And what does that do for you?
01:10:55.96 --> 01:10:56.80 Where does that get you?
01:10:56.80 --> 01:10:58.32 It doesn't get you anywhere.
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:00.04 It matter fact that takes you backwards.
01:11:00.04 --> 01:11:01.04 Yeah.
01:11:01.04 --> 01:11:05.28 So you really truly do have to look at these horrible situations.
01:11:05.28 --> 01:11:14.52 I remember, I got a call back from from overseas that a guy was a seal was really
01:11:14.52 --> 01:11:16.92 badly wounded.
01:11:16.92 --> 01:11:22.20 And a couple of my friends were kind of distraught.
01:11:22.20 --> 01:11:25.88 And I talked to one of the guys overseas.
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:33.04 And I, you know, and, and man, I, at this point, you know, lost Mark, lost Mikey.
01:11:33.04 --> 01:11:34.80 I don't think Ryan had died yet.
01:11:34.80 --> 01:11:39.08 But like I was familiar with guys dying.
01:11:39.08 --> 01:11:40.72 Yeah.
01:11:40.72 --> 01:11:43.16 And I talked to one of the guys that was overseas.
01:11:43.16 --> 01:11:46.96 And they said, hey, you know, this guy is really, really messed up.
01:11:46.96 --> 01:11:49.52 And I'm like, is he going to live?
01:11:49.52 --> 01:11:51.12 And they're like, yeah, he's stable.
01:11:51.12 --> 01:11:54.56 And I go then don't worry about a thing.
01:11:54.56 --> 01:11:55.72 Be happy.
01:11:55.72 --> 01:11:56.72 He's alive.
01:11:56.72 --> 01:12:02.36 And it doesn't matter if he's missing a leg or two legs or whatever, he's going
01:12:02.36 --> 01:12:04.04 to be coming home.
01:12:04.04 --> 01:12:06.24 And he's going to carry on with his life.
01:12:06.24 --> 01:12:07.48 And it's going to be hard.
01:12:07.48 --> 01:12:08.64 And it's going to be hell.
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:10.44 And it's going to be a challenge.
01:12:10.44 --> 01:12:11.44 But guess what?
01:12:11.44 --> 01:12:13.08 He's going to be here.
01:12:13.08 --> 01:12:14.44 Yeah.
01:12:14.44 --> 01:12:18.84 And that, you know, again, it's like, man, what's the alternative?
01:12:18.84 --> 01:12:20.36 The alternative is he's dead.
01:12:20.36 --> 01:12:22.92 The alternative is we never talk to him again.
01:12:22.92 --> 01:12:24.40 That's the alternative.
01:12:24.40 --> 01:12:25.40 Yeah.
01:12:25.40 --> 01:12:26.40 He's going to come back.
01:12:26.40 --> 01:12:27.40 Right?
01:12:27.40 --> 01:12:31.80 And this guy, the guy that got wounded, he wasn't like a great friend of mine.
01:12:31.80 --> 01:12:34.36 But I knew us talking to people that were very close to him.
01:12:34.36 --> 01:12:39.28 And so, you know, I had to make sure I wasn't coming across like, hey, it's no big deal.
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:41.12 I, you know, look, he's going to be fine.
01:12:41.12 --> 01:12:42.32 No, it wasn't like that.
01:12:42.32 --> 01:12:44.12 But look, look what the alternative is.
01:12:44.12 --> 01:12:47.48 You know, let's be thankful that he's alive.
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:48.48 Yeah.
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:49.48 And he's going to come home.
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:52.24 And we're, you know, he's going to carry on with his life.
01:12:52.24 --> 01:12:53.72 And that's what's important.
01:12:53.72 --> 01:12:59.32 So it's really when you do look at these situations, when things are going bad.
01:12:59.32 --> 01:13:00.52 And then you say, okay, well, good.
01:13:00.52 --> 01:13:01.52 Come with that.
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:05.16 And then the one step further is then what happens when someone does die?
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:06.80 Then what good comes of that?
01:13:06.80 --> 01:13:09.56 And my thought is always the same thing.
01:13:09.56 --> 01:13:12.72 I'm thankful that I got to know that person.
01:13:12.72 --> 01:13:16.84 I'm thankful that I got to understand their personality.
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:22.24 I'm thankful that I got to spend a day with them laughing and having that memory.
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:23.24 Yeah.
01:13:23.24 --> 01:13:27.36 So, what's good is I got to experience them in my life and they got to experience other
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:28.56 people's in their lives.
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:31.24 And that's what's good about it.
01:13:31.24 --> 01:13:38.32 But just to say, hey, you know, my friend, my family member is dead.
01:13:38.32 --> 01:13:39.76 This is horrible.
01:13:39.76 --> 01:13:41.48 And I can't escape from this.
01:13:41.48 --> 01:13:42.48 Wrong attitude.
01:13:42.48 --> 01:13:44.52 And of course, you're going to go through that.
01:13:44.52 --> 01:13:47.24 It's the, there's the, whatever those things are that you go through.
01:13:47.24 --> 01:13:48.24 It's shock.
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:49.24 And then denial.
01:13:49.24 --> 01:13:53.48 And then anger and then acceptance and all that.
01:13:53.48 --> 01:13:54.80 That's I get it.
01:13:54.80 --> 01:13:56.76 And it's not going to be easy.
01:13:56.76 --> 01:14:02.48 But I'll tell you what will make it easier is to look at the situation and say, what
01:14:02.48 --> 01:14:04.36 here is good.
01:14:04.36 --> 01:14:09.40 You know, and you, one of the worst things is parents without have young children that
01:14:09.40 --> 01:14:10.64 are terminally ill.
01:14:10.64 --> 01:14:12.28 It's awful.
01:14:12.28 --> 01:14:13.80 It's awful.
01:14:13.80 --> 01:14:18.24 And the best you can think of is say, hold them while you can.
01:14:18.24 --> 01:14:19.24 Right?
01:14:19.24 --> 01:14:23.28 And get what you can and grow the memories that you can right now.
01:14:23.28 --> 01:14:27.72 Because just to focus on the fact that life isn't fair isn't going to help you.
01:14:27.72 --> 01:14:28.72 And guess what?
01:14:28.72 --> 01:14:29.72 You're right.
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:30.72 Life isn't fair.
01:14:30.72 --> 01:14:31.72 Yeah.
01:14:31.72 --> 01:14:32.72 Life isn't fair.
01:14:32.72 --> 01:14:37.16 It's, it's a random, horrible thing.
01:14:37.16 --> 01:14:41.76 And if you want to focus on the randomness and the horribleness of it, that's where you're
01:14:41.76 --> 01:14:43.36 going to end up.
01:14:43.36 --> 01:14:48.60 And if you can focus on the good that comes out of those situations, try to.
01:14:48.60 --> 01:14:50.52 And again, I haven't been through that.
01:14:50.52 --> 01:14:51.52 I haven't been through that.
01:14:51.52 --> 01:14:52.52 Thank God.
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:53.52 Yeah, not that level.
01:14:53.52 --> 01:14:59.60 But the best I can do, the best I can assess is say, man, at least try and look at what
01:14:59.60 --> 01:15:01.72 positive is coming out of this.
01:15:01.72 --> 01:15:06.80 And focus on that instead of focusing on what is negative, chew.
01:15:06.80 --> 01:15:08.20 It's going back to what Frankl said.
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:10.40 You choose what you're at if you're just going to be.
01:15:10.40 --> 01:15:11.40 Yeah.
01:15:11.40 --> 01:15:14.16 Don't become a victim of the randomness.
01:15:14.16 --> 01:15:15.16 Yeah.
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:18.20 And that goes on on all levels.
01:15:18.20 --> 01:15:24.08 You know, even if something isn't horrible, it's just kind of junk.
01:15:24.08 --> 01:15:27.80 All the way down to just something that's pretty horrible.
01:15:27.80 --> 01:15:30.84 There's still a lot of good going on in the situation.
01:15:30.84 --> 01:15:35.48 But in just like, are you saying, like, your attitude or another way to put it is what you're
01:15:35.48 --> 01:15:38.08 looking for to internalize?
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:40.16 You know, a lot of times I know it's natural.
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:43.12 And I've been there where it's like, everything just seems bad.
01:15:43.12 --> 01:15:46.36 Even the smut like, if something real bad happens, that you think is real bad.
01:15:46.36 --> 01:15:51.32 And then the same day or the next year, whatever, something small bad happens, it'll just
01:15:51.32 --> 01:15:52.88 add big time to the badness.
01:15:52.88 --> 01:15:54.04 Like, nothing's going right.
01:15:54.04 --> 01:15:55.04 Kind of attitude.
01:15:55.04 --> 01:15:57.44 Meanwhile, all the good things are going on all around you.
01:15:57.44 --> 01:15:58.96 We're not looking for that all those things.
01:15:58.96 --> 01:15:59.96 Yeah.
01:15:59.96 --> 01:16:03.32 So in a lot of times with like, real bad situations, especially with kids, because that's
01:16:03.32 --> 01:16:07.40 like the the most weak you can ever feel really like your kid.
01:16:07.40 --> 01:16:09.68 Like when my daughter had to chew a big staff infection.
01:16:09.68 --> 01:16:13.36 And so in her lymph nodes over neck of the age and the hospital for a week.
01:16:13.36 --> 01:16:15.68 And we're there.
01:16:15.68 --> 01:16:20.60 That's like the most weak in that that you'll feel in, of course, there's way worse situations.
01:16:20.60 --> 01:16:21.60 Yeah.
01:16:21.60 --> 01:16:23.36 And then that's nothing compared to situations.
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:24.56 I know that.
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:30.52 But there are good things that are still going on in your situation, your life.
01:16:30.52 --> 01:16:34.92 That's a B. There's good situations that can come of it.
01:16:34.92 --> 01:16:38.000 And a lot of them, a lot of them are strength related.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.56 You know, like if you let something beat you down and you don't get this strength, like
01:16:42.56 --> 01:16:43.56 that's a loss.
01:16:43.56 --> 01:16:44.56 You'll lose.
01:16:44.56 --> 01:16:48.96 Like you'll, so you're saying you're getting some kind of conditioning from it.
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:51.12 In a way, in a matter of speaking, yes.
01:16:51.12 --> 01:16:57.32 So like if you have a quote unquote good attitude, when you emerge from the situation,
01:16:57.32 --> 01:16:59.28 you will have strength now.
01:16:59.28 --> 01:17:01.24 If you don't, you won't, you'll have weakness.
01:17:01.24 --> 01:17:03.04 You'll be, you know, gun shy.
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:04.20 Everything happens bad.
01:17:04.20 --> 01:17:05.20 My life sucks.
01:17:05.20 --> 01:17:07.000 And you know, you'll continue down.
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.32 And then that road.
01:17:08.32 --> 01:17:13.84 So the good part, like if you said, like I said, if you keep that good attitude, and when
01:17:13.84 --> 01:17:18.76 you make it out, you will have the other good things that can come from it.
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:20.48 You will have the strength.
01:17:20.48 --> 01:17:21.48 Yeah.
01:17:21.48 --> 01:17:22.48 And you're right.
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:25.72 And I mean, just look at Captain Plum and look at Colonel Reader.
01:17:25.72 --> 01:17:30.68 Anyhow, for those guys to go through what they went through and maintain a positive attitude.
01:17:30.68 --> 01:17:33.88 And then they come out and you talk to those guys and it's like, you can't think of
01:17:33.88 --> 01:17:36.000 more positive people in the world.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000 Yeah.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000 You know, I mean, not in the whole world, but you, they're just have so much positivity
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.24 because they've been through something and they had to maintain that attitude.
01:17:44.24 --> 01:17:45.52 So you're right when they come out.
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:47.44 It's like how are you going to make?
01:17:47.44 --> 01:17:52.48 And I think that's what happens a lot of times with guys that have been to war is they
01:17:52.48 --> 01:17:54.76 come back and they're like happy to see the sunrise.
01:17:54.76 --> 01:17:55.76 I know I am.
01:17:55.76 --> 01:17:57.52 I'm happy to see the sunrise.
01:17:57.52 --> 01:18:00.000 I'm happier than a lot of people to see the sunrise.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.76 I appreciate that thing.
01:18:01.76 --> 01:18:05.28 And I think when people go through some kind of devastating disease in their family or
01:18:05.28 --> 01:18:10.16 themselves, same thing once they get through it, they at least come out the other side and
01:18:10.16 --> 01:18:11.80 they can appreciate it.
01:18:11.80 --> 01:18:15.36 And yet if they let it beat them down, it's going to, it's going to everything is going
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:16.36 to look down.
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:17.64 If you're looking down, you're going to look down.
01:18:17.64 --> 01:18:19.36 If you're looking up, you're going to look up.
01:18:19.36 --> 01:18:20.36 Yeah.
01:18:20.36 --> 01:18:23.16 That's got to be a, it's hard.
01:18:23.16 --> 01:18:24.88 I mean, it's so hard for people.
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:25.88 It's so hard.
01:18:25.88 --> 01:18:26.88 Yeah.
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:28.64 And again, I'm over here talking, you know.
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:30.000 Yeah, for sure, both of us are.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.48 You know, when I was on Joe Rogan, we started off talking about Chris Cornell, it's kill
01:18:34.48 --> 01:18:35.48 himself.
01:18:35.48 --> 01:18:38.28 We kind of cursory kind of talked about depression and neither want to.
01:18:38.28 --> 01:18:44.08 I mean, I definitely am not claiming to be any kind of expert at all about it.
01:18:44.08 --> 01:18:46.24 And I even said on there, I was like, look, I've never felt this way.
01:18:46.24 --> 01:18:49.32 And I had just a couple of people hit me up on social media like, you know, you should
01:18:49.32 --> 01:18:54.08 you should read this or you should do this or and, and, you know, or you're not right.
01:18:54.08 --> 01:18:56.96 And I'm like, no, I wasn't even trying to say anything that I'm right.
01:18:56.96 --> 01:18:59.92 I'm just tell, I was saying, I don't actually even know.
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:00.92 Yeah.
01:19:00.92 --> 01:19:07.24 And so yeah, I'm not, you know, certainly an expert on how to overcome, you know, horrible
01:19:07.24 --> 01:19:08.24 situations.
01:19:08.24 --> 01:19:10.60 But I've been in some pretty horrible situations.
01:19:10.60 --> 01:19:12.84 And this is what my thoughts tried to be.
01:19:12.84 --> 01:19:13.84 Yeah.
01:19:13.84 --> 01:19:15.84 And it's not always easy at all.
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:16.84 Yeah.
01:19:16.84 --> 01:19:23.40 Jordan Peterson has some good good, you know, good content on that where he's basically
01:19:23.40 --> 01:19:28.84 in that cell, he says, get yourself together where in his example, one of the many was,
01:19:28.84 --> 01:19:31.80 you know, a family member dies or whatever, get yourself together.
01:19:31.80 --> 01:19:33.04 So, you know, what are you going to do?
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:35.32 Are you going to wallow with the rest of the people?
01:19:35.32 --> 01:19:39.000 So, no one can get a hold of anything in the funerals of master, whatever, or you
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.52 can get yourself together, grief for sure, get, but get yourself together.
01:19:42.52 --> 01:19:47.68 So, you can kind of lead and get the funeral together and take care of the business or whatever.
01:19:47.68 --> 01:19:50.76 And it's such a cold, blooded thing to say, right?
01:19:50.76 --> 01:19:51.96 It's the complete.
01:19:51.96 --> 01:19:57.12 And that's what I think is hard about it is, you know, think about this.
01:19:57.12 --> 01:20:00.56 Oh, if someone in your family died and I was like, echo, get yourself together.
01:20:00.56 --> 01:20:01.56 Right.
01:20:01.56 --> 01:20:02.56 You know what I mean?
01:20:02.56 --> 01:20:03.56 Who says that?
01:20:03.56 --> 01:20:05.96 But that's probably the best thing I could possibly say to you.
01:20:05.96 --> 01:20:06.96 Yeah.
01:20:06.96 --> 01:20:08.16 I might need to say it in a more tactful way.
01:20:08.16 --> 01:20:13.04 I might just say, hey, I command, I feel for you, hey, man, what we need to do is
01:20:13.04 --> 01:20:15.08 grieve, but we also need to focus on moving forward.
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:16.08 You know what I mean?
01:20:16.08 --> 01:20:17.08 It's that kind of thing.
01:20:17.08 --> 01:20:18.64 But the reality is, what am I really saying?
01:20:18.64 --> 01:20:21.48 I'm really saying, hey, get yourself together.
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:22.48 You got to move on.
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:23.48 We got to move on.
01:20:23.48 --> 01:20:24.76 We got to move forward.
01:20:24.76 --> 01:20:26.16 You got to move forward in your life.
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:28.92 And that's such a hard thing to say to somebody.
01:20:28.92 --> 01:20:29.92 Yeah.
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:33.000 But that's probably the right attitude to take.
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000 Yeah.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000 Okay.
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000 Like, this is horrible.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.56 And I need to keep it together.
01:20:38.56 --> 01:20:39.56 Yeah.
01:20:39.56 --> 01:20:40.56 Yeah.
01:20:40.56 --> 01:20:48.04 Yeah, man, especially when there's no majorly prevalent things that are at risk
01:20:48.04 --> 01:20:49.64 at that moment as well.
01:20:49.64 --> 01:20:54.40 You know, like, your situation, like, in a combat situation, I think BTF Tony was talking
01:20:54.40 --> 01:20:55.40 about this.
01:20:55.40 --> 01:20:59.96 If you're in a firefight or something like that, and something gets hit, you don't just
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:00.96 quit.
01:21:00.96 --> 01:21:01.96 No.
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:02.96 Exit the fire fighting.
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:03.96 Oh, my gosh, my guy's hit.
01:21:03.96 --> 01:21:05.36 It's like, okay, he's hit.
01:21:05.36 --> 01:21:06.36 Boom.
01:21:06.36 --> 01:21:07.60 Let's continue the firefight.
01:21:07.60 --> 01:21:09.08 But let's say there was no firefight.
01:21:09.08 --> 01:21:10.24 Then the guy gets hit.
01:21:10.24 --> 01:21:14.32 It seems like a harder thing to just move on.
01:21:14.32 --> 01:21:15.32 So what are you talking about?
01:21:15.32 --> 01:21:16.32 Yeah.
01:21:16.32 --> 01:21:18.52 You need to have a firefight going on.
01:21:18.52 --> 01:21:24.000 So that you, so that you can say, okay, I'm going to deal with this.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.20 But I need to also think about the rest of life.
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:28.20 Yeah.
01:21:28.20 --> 01:21:29.20 So hard.
01:21:29.20 --> 01:21:32.96 And, you know, again, it's, you know what I'm feeling like right now?
01:21:32.96 --> 01:21:38.24 I got, I get some social media sometimes where someone will say, hey, I'm not a vet.
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:40.08 But like a friend of mine is going through problems.
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:41.76 And I don't know how to talk to him because I'm not a vet.
01:21:41.76 --> 01:21:43.08 And that's kind of like what I feel like right now.
01:21:43.08 --> 01:21:45.08 Like I haven't been through those kind of suffering.
01:21:45.08 --> 01:21:47.92 So I'm throwing darts.
01:21:47.92 --> 01:21:49.68 But I'm throwing them based on what I know.
01:21:49.68 --> 01:21:52.92 So it's the best, like, you know, best I could do.
01:21:52.92 --> 01:21:53.92 Yeah.
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:58.80 You're at risk of someone saying, hey, you simply don't understand.
01:21:58.80 --> 01:21:59.80 And my fact is there.
01:21:59.80 --> 01:22:00.80 Yeah.
01:22:00.80 --> 01:22:03.80 And my statement to that would be, yes, I don't understand.
01:22:03.80 --> 01:22:08.92 You know, it's like in the, when I was talking to veterans saying, look, people, you feel
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:10.32 like people don't understand?
01:22:10.32 --> 01:22:11.32 They don't.
01:22:11.32 --> 01:22:12.32 And that's okay.
01:22:12.32 --> 01:22:15.80 And so definitely not sitting here saying, oh, you know, I know.
01:22:15.80 --> 01:22:17.24 This is what you're doing in a situation like that.
01:22:17.24 --> 01:22:18.24 No, I don't know.
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:19.24 Yeah.
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:22.84 I don't know what you do when your family member suffers something.
01:22:22.84 --> 01:22:24.52 I agree just like that.
01:22:24.52 --> 01:22:26.28 Like a terminal disease or deaf.
01:22:26.28 --> 01:22:27.88 I don't know.
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:30.16 Haven't been through it.
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:33.32 What I have been through is losing guys in combat.
01:22:33.32 --> 01:22:34.68 That I have been through.
01:22:34.68 --> 01:22:37.16 This is, this is darkness.
01:22:37.16 --> 01:22:39.84 It's a different kind of darkness.
01:22:39.84 --> 01:22:45.000 But this is what I did in those situations.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.88 And that's what I would think would help you in these other situations.
01:22:50.88 --> 01:22:51.88 Hard.
01:22:51.88 --> 01:22:52.88 Question, right?
01:22:52.88 --> 01:22:53.88 What do you do?
01:22:53.88 --> 01:22:54.88 Hard.
01:22:54.88 --> 01:22:59.96 And we are sitting here reading a book by a guy that was in a concentration camp.
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:03.12 And he's saying this thing to do.
01:23:03.12 --> 01:23:13.92 So that's another sort of reinforcement of this thought pattern.
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:14.92 Yeah.
01:23:14.92 --> 01:23:17.56 All right.
01:23:17.56 --> 01:23:20.48 He talks a little bit about the passage of time here.
01:23:20.48 --> 01:23:24.12 In camp, a small unit of time.
01:23:24.12 --> 01:23:30.64 A day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue appeared endless.
01:23:30.64 --> 01:23:35.56 A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly.
01:23:35.56 --> 01:23:42.84 My comrades agreed when I said that in the camp, a day lasted longer than a week.
01:23:42.84 --> 01:23:46.16 How paradoxical was our time experience.
01:23:46.16 --> 01:23:50.16 And that's something this actually reminded me I was talking to a Sarah Armstrong.
01:23:50.16 --> 01:23:54.72 And well now it's actually around the conversation when life was talking about heat
01:23:54.72 --> 01:23:58.76 come out here and seeing all my kids, my kids are all grown up now.
01:23:58.76 --> 01:24:01.20 Basically, except for my little list one.
01:24:01.20 --> 01:24:04.28 But my oldest daughter's graduate in high school, you know, a couple of weeks and she's
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.68 going to go to college.
01:24:05.68 --> 01:24:10.92 And you know, when life met her, she was, what was that 12 years ago?
01:24:10.92 --> 01:24:19.08 So she was, you know, no, six, something like that.
01:24:19.08 --> 01:24:24.56 So, you know, young and then you came out here, you know, he just come left his apartment
01:24:24.56 --> 01:24:28.48 in New York City where he's got his wife and kids and they're, you know, it's chaos
01:24:28.48 --> 01:24:32.52 and little kids and they're crying and screaming and spilling stuff and throwing up milk
01:24:32.52 --> 01:24:37.000 and pissing everywhere and it's just, you know, that's what life is when you're there.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.36 And you know, he came out here and saw how my kids were now grown up.
01:24:41.36 --> 01:24:43.40 That time has gone, by the way, gone.
01:24:43.40 --> 01:24:45.52 And get it back.
01:24:45.52 --> 01:24:49.80 And he, you know, he talked about it on the podcast, just name and make sure you appreciate
01:24:49.80 --> 01:24:50.80 those.
01:24:50.80 --> 01:24:55.76 And Sarah Armstrong, you know, said something along the lines of the days are long, but the
01:24:55.76 --> 01:24:56.76 years are short.
01:24:56.76 --> 01:24:57.76 Yeah.
01:24:57.76 --> 01:24:59.16 That's a very true statement.
01:24:59.16 --> 01:25:02.16 And you can, you can see that cured the same thing.
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:13.12 You know, all of a sudden, this time is just going by so quickly.
01:25:13.12 --> 01:25:15.92 This is starting to talk again back to the attitude.
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:20.64 We could say that most men in a concentration camp believe that the real opportunities of
01:25:20.64 --> 01:25:22.44 life had passed.
01:25:22.44 --> 01:25:26.24 Yet in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge.
01:25:26.24 --> 01:25:33.44 One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or
01:25:33.44 --> 01:25:39.48 one could ignore the challenges and simply vegetate as did a majority of the prisoners.
01:25:39.48 --> 01:25:41.36 Same thing, same topic.
01:25:41.36 --> 01:25:43.08 I know it's interesting.
01:25:43.08 --> 01:25:48.68 I told you this before we started this book, you know, is a great book.
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:55.40 But I, I kind of wanted to talk about how bad concentration camps were, and I went and
01:25:55.40 --> 01:25:59.000 found some other sources for that.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000 Because Victor Franco doesn't highlight it that much.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.28 I mean, his ad, I mean, he was in Auschwitz for crying out loud.
01:26:06.28 --> 01:26:08.28 Doesn't get any worse.
01:26:08.28 --> 01:26:13.92 And, you know, to really give the impact of how bad it was, I went and found some other
01:26:13.92 --> 01:26:20.000 sources that were a little bit more directly written and a little bit more horrifying
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.68 to be lack of a better word.
01:26:22.68 --> 01:26:27.20 Because in his accounts, he doesn't go into those, some of those graphic details, which
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:30.60 I feel like you should know, and you should understand what.
01:26:30.60 --> 01:26:32.72 Before you talk about, hey, he's keeping a good attitude.
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:36.000 But no, no, it's not he's keeping a good attitude, because he was in a concentration camp,
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000 but it wasn't that bad.
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000 No.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.20 And that's what he's dealing with.
01:26:40.20 --> 01:26:47.60 And in his mind, you could make a triumph or a victory out of those experiences, which
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:51.20 is incredible attitude to have.
01:26:51.20 --> 01:27:01.36 Going back to the book, the prisoner who had lost faith in the future, his future was
01:27:01.36 --> 01:27:03.36 doomed.
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.56 With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold.
01:27:07.56 --> 01:27:14.32 He let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay.
01:27:14.32 --> 01:27:18.44 Usually this happened quite suddenly in the form of a crisis, the symptoms of which were
01:27:18.44 --> 01:27:22.08 familiar to the experience camp inmate.
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:26.24 We all feared this moment, not for ourselves, which would have been pointless, but for
01:27:26.24 --> 01:27:28.04 our friends.
01:27:28.04 --> 01:27:32.64 Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one morning to get dressed and wash or to
01:27:32.64 --> 01:27:35.16 go out on the parade grounds.
01:27:35.16 --> 01:27:39.72 No intrudes, no blows, no threats had any effect.
01:27:39.72 --> 01:27:42.68 He just lay there hardly moving.
01:27:42.68 --> 01:27:47.88 If this crisis was brought about by an illness, he refused to be taken to the sick bay or
01:27:47.88 --> 01:27:49.88 do anything to help himself.
01:27:49.88 --> 01:27:52.92 He simply gave up.
01:27:52.92 --> 01:28:02.16 There he remained lying in his own extra, excret a, and nothing bothered him anymore.
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:09.48 That's similar to what Colonel Riderset, how if you didn't actively stay alive, you
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:10.68 would die.
01:28:10.68 --> 01:28:13.04 You couldn't just passively exist.
01:28:13.04 --> 01:28:14.04 You weren't going to make it.
01:28:14.04 --> 01:28:20.64 If you wanted to die, all you had to do is stop trying, then you were going to die.
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:24.60 Back to the book, as we said before, any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in
01:28:24.60 --> 01:28:30.96 the camp had to first succeed in showing him some future goal.
01:28:30.96 --> 01:28:43.04 In Nietzsche's words, he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.
01:28:43.04 --> 01:28:49.28 That could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohyogenic efforts regarding
01:28:49.28 --> 01:28:51.68 prisoners.
01:28:51.68 --> 01:28:56.52 Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why, an aim for their
01:28:56.52 --> 01:28:57.92 lives.
01:28:57.92 --> 01:29:04.14 In order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence, what to him who
01:29:04.14 --> 01:29:12.000 saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point to carrying on.
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.48 He was soon lost.
01:29:14.48 --> 01:29:18.08 Got to know why you're doing what you're doing.
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:19.84 That's all there is to it.
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:26.12 He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.
01:29:26.12 --> 01:29:30.44 Obviously, that translates right into a leader's perspective, making sure people understand
01:29:30.44 --> 01:29:31.44 why they're doing what they're doing.
01:29:31.44 --> 01:29:33.36 You just don't part of quarters at him.
01:29:33.36 --> 01:29:37.84 But from an individual perspective, why are you doing this?
01:29:37.84 --> 01:29:40.84 Find that.
01:29:40.84 --> 01:29:47.88 I actually made a post on social media the other day.
01:29:47.88 --> 01:29:53.32 It was something long, a lot of finding your inner why or something like that.
01:29:53.32 --> 01:29:58.72 I was mocking that attitude.
01:29:58.72 --> 01:30:04.36 I was saying sometimes my inner voice is trying to find out why I'm doing what I'm doing.
01:30:04.36 --> 01:30:07.04 When I'm doing something hard, my inner voice doesn't allow to talk.
01:30:07.04 --> 01:30:08.04 Be quiet.
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:12.76 I'm over here working.
01:30:12.76 --> 01:30:18.48 But there is, obviously, just like a leadership perspective and from a personal perspective,
01:30:18.48 --> 01:30:20.08 why are you doing what you're doing?
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:23.16 That should be the driving force.
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:26.32 If you don't have that, it's hard to overcome these challenges.
01:30:26.32 --> 01:30:29.48 You can't just overcome challenges just because they're there.
01:30:29.48 --> 01:30:32.16 You need some greater reason.
01:30:32.16 --> 01:30:35.92 When that gets lost, you get lost.
01:30:35.92 --> 01:30:40.16 I don't know why I thought those were.
01:30:40.16 --> 01:30:45.92 I think the one why you were mocking that, this is my why.
01:30:45.92 --> 01:30:50.64 It wasn't, it wasn't, now that I think about it, it wasn't really the why thing.
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:52.28 It was more about the inner voice.
01:30:52.28 --> 01:30:55.12 But yeah, I know I definitely said why in the tale.
01:30:55.12 --> 01:31:01.68 Because people do, it's like a lot of good expressions or things or whatever.
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:05.88 Or people just, oh, I like that and they'll just start throwing it out and abusing it.
01:31:05.88 --> 01:31:09.88 It dumps it down and then everyone's saying it, now it just sort of sounds cheesy because
01:31:09.88 --> 01:31:11.36 no one's actually doing it.
01:31:11.36 --> 01:31:15.28 No one's actually understanding the real what it really means.
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:21.32 The person who's like, hey, I'm going to lose weight and they've basically spent their life neglecting
01:31:21.32 --> 01:31:22.32 their health or whatever.
01:31:22.32 --> 01:31:28.20 They're like, okay, I'm going to get in shape and then they go on this program.
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:32.80 They quit, but when they're doing good on the program, let's say the first or second day,
01:31:32.80 --> 01:31:38.08 they'll be like, this is my why and they'll show their dog or something like that.
01:31:38.08 --> 01:31:43.40 My why or my kids or whatever, but then the next day they quit the program.
01:31:43.40 --> 01:31:44.40 It's such a weak thing.
01:31:44.40 --> 01:31:47.44 You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just do that.
01:31:47.44 --> 01:31:49.84 That whole thing, my why.
01:31:49.84 --> 01:31:54.08 Whatever, that's way too powerful for people to just be like, hey, my why and then just not do it.
01:31:54.08 --> 01:31:55.72 It should know just like a little thing.
01:31:55.72 --> 01:32:01.92 You can't just throw a together a 38 second Instagram post that's about you.
01:32:01.92 --> 01:32:02.92 Why.
01:32:02.92 --> 01:32:03.92 That need you need to dig.
01:32:03.92 --> 01:32:05.36 Yeah, you gotta do that stuff.
01:32:05.36 --> 01:32:10.000 So that's why it's funny because like, people just throw that out now.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.20 Not means like nothing and it's almost like they seem, it seems like it seems like it's
01:32:15.20 --> 01:32:17.04 totally my interpretation of it.
01:32:17.04 --> 01:32:22.84 But it seems like they're saying it and thinking that they sound so profound and deep and
01:32:22.84 --> 01:32:26.52 new and inspirational, you know, but everyone's saying it.
01:32:26.52 --> 01:32:33.80 And to counter your point, I've had plenty of people that have talked to me about, you
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:34.80 know, I wasn't bad shape.
01:32:34.80 --> 01:32:36.48 I wasn't taking care of myself.
01:32:36.48 --> 01:32:40.08 I wasn't healthy and I had my first kid.
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:45.08 And I said to myself, I need to be there for my kid or I was doing bad at work and I didn't
01:32:45.08 --> 01:32:48.28 like Aaron, it wasn't focused on that career, it wasn't focused on being squared away and
01:32:48.28 --> 01:32:50.96 I was wasting all my money on dumb stuff and I had my first kid.
01:32:50.96 --> 01:32:51.96 Yeah.
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:55.56 And then I said, I gotta, you know, this, this is me taking care of my kid and I need to do a
01:32:55.56 --> 01:32:56.56 damn good job.
01:32:56.56 --> 01:33:00.64 And that's exactly the point right there is that it's a real thing.
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:03.44 And if that's for real, you're, you're why conceptually no.
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:05.84 I'm just in the expression for sure.
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:09.000 For sure, but there's a big difference between, well, there's a big difference between
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.16 between the contemplation that goes into.
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:12.16 I'm doing this for my kid.
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:13.16 It's cool.
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:14.16 I'm going to go on weight watchers.
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:15.16 Right?
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:18.56 It's like, um, no, like think about this.
01:33:18.56 --> 01:33:22.32 Think about your relationship with your children and where you're going to end up and
01:33:22.32 --> 01:33:25.88 now you want to see them live and what guidance you can give them as human beings.
01:33:25.88 --> 01:33:29.76 And the example that you're sending for them and you line all those things up, then
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:31.32 maybe you can put down the donuts.
01:33:31.32 --> 01:33:33.12 Yeah, you're not clear it.
01:33:33.12 --> 01:33:34.12 In other words, you gotta do it.
01:33:34.12 --> 01:33:35.12 Yeah.
01:33:35.12 --> 01:33:38.80 Actually, you know, so yeah, that's why it just sounds cheesy because everyone does it.
01:33:38.80 --> 01:33:40.68 It says it.
01:33:40.68 --> 01:33:43.04 This is a great section going back to the book.
01:33:43.04 --> 01:33:49.68 We had to learn ourselves and furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men that it
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:59.64 did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.
01:33:59.64 --> 01:34:04.000 We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life and instead to think of ourselves as
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.64 those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly.
01:34:10.64 --> 01:34:19.72 One answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct.
01:34:19.72 --> 01:34:25.04 Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:30.88 and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
01:34:30.88 --> 01:34:34.40 Again, you're turning, you're flipping this idea around.
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:37.08 It's not about what I want from life.
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:39.64 It's what what is life want from me.
01:34:39.64 --> 01:34:43.32 And it's putting these challenges and these hurdles in front of me and I gotta go and jump
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:44.60 over them.
01:34:44.60 --> 01:34:48.64 And then I got a smash them and then I got to set fire to them and then I got to use that
01:34:48.64 --> 01:34:54.04 fire to fuel the domination of everything that's in my path.
01:34:54.04 --> 01:34:57.04 That kind of like, hey, these weights aren't going to lift themselves.
01:34:57.04 --> 01:34:58.84 It's the exact same thing.
01:34:58.84 --> 01:35:01.16 It's the exact same thing.
01:35:01.16 --> 01:35:06.000 Yeah.
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.52 And again, going back to this idea that war reveals human nature and this is Dr. Frankl's
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:21.64 way of putting this exact same thing that I say back to the book, Life and a concentration
01:35:21.64 --> 01:35:27.40 camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths.
01:35:27.40 --> 01:35:35.32 It is, is it surprising that in those depths, we again found only human qualities which
01:35:35.32 --> 01:35:42.08 in their very nature were a mixture of good and evil.
01:35:42.08 --> 01:35:47.92 The rift dividing good from evil which goes through all human beings reaches into the
01:35:47.92 --> 01:35:54.04 lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by
01:35:54.04 --> 01:36:00.12 the concentration camp.
01:36:00.12 --> 01:36:04.80 So we've got this idea once again that there's a dichotomy.
01:36:04.80 --> 01:36:13.64 In people, in people, this dichotomy that you're capable of doing extreme good and you're
01:36:13.64 --> 01:36:15.36 capable of doing extreme evil.
01:36:15.36 --> 01:36:22.04 And we've seen it a bunch, we've seen it a bunch on this podcast.
01:36:22.04 --> 01:36:24.72 You look at the mele i'masicker.
01:36:24.72 --> 01:36:34.72 Those guys were normal guys that committed extreme evil straight up evil.
01:36:34.72 --> 01:36:41.44 Normal guys that were, you know, four days earlier probably would have done something
01:36:41.44 --> 01:36:44.68 heroic to save someone.
01:36:44.68 --> 01:36:49.40 And here they are the other end of the spectrum.
01:36:49.40 --> 01:36:56.68 And I think that you have to, we have to face that not only individually do you have that,
01:36:56.68 --> 01:37:00.28 but then obviously as the group you have that, as a group of human beings, we have that
01:37:00.28 --> 01:37:01.28 capability.
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:02.52 We've seen it over and over again.
01:37:02.52 --> 01:37:05.84 If you want to know what that good part is, you got to know what that darkness is
01:37:05.84 --> 01:37:06.84 to.
01:37:06.84 --> 01:37:11.40 Yeah, the group thing is interesting.
01:37:11.40 --> 01:37:15.20 You know, you know, you always hear not always, but you hear sometimes about these riots
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:20.64 on college campuses, whether it be after a game or something like that.
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:25.84 But at a glance, you think dang is this college full of just whole guns?
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:29.16 Like if this bit like you dry it, you know, but it's that.
01:37:29.16 --> 01:37:33.44 It's like as an individual or, you know, under a quote unquote normal circumstances,
01:37:33.44 --> 01:37:35.08 they just, they're just normal people.
01:37:35.08 --> 01:37:38.56 You know, guys girls, whatever, they're just normal people.
01:37:38.56 --> 01:37:43.32 But then you put them in this particular situation in some way extreme or whatever, you know,
01:37:43.32 --> 01:37:44.32 it's a spectrum.
01:37:44.32 --> 01:37:46.52 But, and they just act different.
01:37:46.52 --> 01:37:49.40 And the whole group dynamic to this act different.
01:37:49.40 --> 01:37:54.76 The group dynamic is a, is it can be a very, very scary thing.
01:37:54.76 --> 01:37:58.12 There's no doubt it can be a very, very scary thing.
01:37:58.12 --> 01:38:02.44 And that's why, you know, even when he's talking about, and I mentioned this on when
01:38:02.44 --> 01:38:08.28 I was on Joe Rogan's last podcast and this idea of individual freedom and acting as an individual
01:38:08.28 --> 01:38:16.24 is so important as to structure your life around to say, look, I'm not part of this group.
01:38:16.24 --> 01:38:17.44 Your group is not me.
01:38:17.44 --> 01:38:18.44 Yeah.
01:38:18.44 --> 01:38:19.44 This group is not me.
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:21.24 They don't represent me.
01:38:21.24 --> 01:38:22.24 I represent me.
01:38:22.24 --> 01:38:23.24 Exactly.
01:38:23.24 --> 01:38:26.20 And I have my own individual choices.
01:38:26.20 --> 01:38:31.16 And that's what he's saying in here, the minute you give away to the herd, that's when
01:38:31.16 --> 01:38:34.28 you start going, you don't know, you're, you don't longer control it.
01:38:34.28 --> 01:38:35.28 Yeah.
01:38:35.28 --> 01:38:37.40 And when you give up that control, that's a scary, scary thing.
01:38:37.40 --> 01:38:39.72 And that's when these evil things take place.
01:38:39.72 --> 01:38:40.72 Yeah.
01:38:40.72 --> 01:38:45.96 And that, once again, it's, it's like, it's easy to say now.
01:38:45.96 --> 01:38:49.20 Because grouping yourself is actually a survival mechanism.
01:38:49.20 --> 01:38:50.20 True.
01:38:50.20 --> 01:38:53.92 So you, you know, it's not going to be just that you're not going to naturally just be an
01:38:53.92 --> 01:38:58.64 individual and act like an individual and conduct yourself in all these extreme situations
01:38:58.64 --> 01:38:59.64 as an individual.
01:38:59.64 --> 01:39:01.84 You're not just going to naturally do that.
01:39:01.84 --> 01:39:02.84 True.
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:05.20 So I guess it just helps to know these things.
01:39:05.20 --> 01:39:09.56 Well, that's, you're, you're a hundred percent right on both facets.
01:39:09.56 --> 01:39:10.56 Number one, yes.
01:39:10.56 --> 01:39:15.000 Grouping and fitting in is a survival instinct that people have.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.20 And that's why trends happen.
01:39:17.20 --> 01:39:19.04 And that's why nations happen.
01:39:19.04 --> 01:39:23.88 And that's why that's why groups occur in people.
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:24.88 And politics.
01:39:24.88 --> 01:39:27.12 Yeah, politics and everything, right?
01:39:27.12 --> 01:39:28.12 The, these groups.
01:39:28.12 --> 01:39:31.40 And I mean, it's weird now because with the internet, you can have groups.
01:39:31.40 --> 01:39:32.40 You can be part of these groups.
01:39:32.40 --> 01:39:33.40 Yeah.
01:39:33.40 --> 01:39:35.40 But honestly, yeah, whatever group you want.
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:37.64 And you can connect with all these different people.
01:39:37.64 --> 01:39:45.36 But it's also important to make sure that you do remember that you are an individual.
01:39:45.36 --> 01:39:53.36 Man, you can't, that you don't want to give up that last shred of human will to decide
01:39:53.36 --> 01:39:54.88 what your attitude is going to be.
01:39:54.88 --> 01:39:55.88 Yeah, dang.
01:39:55.88 --> 01:40:02.44 And today, you know, in our luxurious society, if you can consciously navigate your waste
01:40:02.44 --> 01:40:06.12 clear that of falling into the group trap, it's what it is.
01:40:06.12 --> 01:40:07.12 It's a trap.
01:40:07.12 --> 01:40:11.32 Because you don't have to, if you can do that successfully, but probably you won't
01:40:11.32 --> 01:40:13.08 fall for the tricks, man.
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:14.08 Like that's the thing.
01:40:14.08 --> 01:40:15.84 You get air, we all get tricked.
01:40:15.84 --> 01:40:20.36 All the way down to just something is seemingly benign as marketing.
01:40:20.36 --> 01:40:23.48 This man, you'll just fall for way less tricks.
01:40:23.48 --> 01:40:25.64 You don't like those tricks out there in the world, do you?
01:40:25.64 --> 01:40:27.64 No, I don't.
01:40:27.64 --> 01:40:32.52 Probably fell for too many of them, I think.
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:34.48 This is a, I'm gonna wrap this book.
01:40:34.48 --> 01:40:35.64 This book is not long.
01:40:35.64 --> 01:40:37.20 It's a very fast read.
01:40:37.20 --> 01:40:46.60 And actually, he goes into sort of goes into the more of the psychological, the psychiatrists,
01:40:46.60 --> 01:40:52.04 the actual academic of it than I covered, but this is a fast read.
01:40:52.04 --> 01:40:55.72 I mean, it's only 150 pages or so.
01:40:55.72 --> 01:41:00.68 And you definitely get a raw look at, at human nature.
01:41:00.68 --> 01:41:03.76 But this closing, I think, is very, very powerful.
01:41:03.76 --> 01:41:10.92 Going back to the book, a human being is not one thing among others.
01:41:10.92 --> 01:41:12.84 Things determine each other.
01:41:12.84 --> 01:41:17.84 But man is ultimately self-determining.
01:41:17.84 --> 01:41:23.60 What he becomes within the limits of endowment and environment.
01:41:23.60 --> 01:41:27.40 He has made out of himself.
01:41:27.40 --> 01:41:35.000 In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground,
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000 we watched in witness some of our comrades behave like swine.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.88 All others behave like saints.
01:41:45.88 --> 01:41:56.84 Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions,
01:41:56.84 --> 01:42:01.56 but not on conditions.
01:42:01.56 --> 01:42:09.04 Our generation is realistic for we have come to no man as he really is.
01:42:09.04 --> 01:42:17.08 After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz.
01:42:17.08 --> 01:42:25.88 However, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright with the Lord's
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:36.000 prayer, or the Shema Israel on his lips.
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:50.40 And I think that thought that man has both potentialities within himself and we've seen
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:53.76 them over and over again.
01:42:53.76 --> 01:43:01.36 These grand expanded potentialities in extreme display.
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:08.72 And we've talked about these situations in the podcast over and over again in the Burma
01:43:08.72 --> 01:43:16.40 Railway that was built by the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war were tortured and
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:21.40 killed by the Japanese and the genocide and a war in the rape of Nanking.
01:43:21.40 --> 01:43:30.12 And we've also seen the other potentiality.
01:43:30.12 --> 01:43:42.60 We've seen that over and over again that potentiality of goodness and of sacrifice.
01:43:42.60 --> 01:43:51.72 Those men that we've seen over and over again that lay down their lives or for their brothers
01:43:51.72 --> 01:43:58.36 and in doing so protect our freedom.
01:43:58.36 --> 01:44:08.96 But it's important to note that again that whether the evil is actualized in the minds
01:44:08.96 --> 01:44:18.12 of men that is not based on conditions but on decisions.
01:44:18.12 --> 01:44:25.52 And this doesn't only apply to good evil, of course, that's the most expansive thought
01:44:25.52 --> 01:44:31.04 that we can apply this to but it also applies to everything we choose to do or choose
01:44:31.04 --> 01:44:40.32 not to do and everything we choose to become or not to become.
01:44:40.32 --> 01:44:42.92 It's us.
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:51.000 It's our choice and we are responsible.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.40 We are responsible to be good instead of evil to be strong instead of weak to become what
01:44:58.40 --> 01:45:06.40 we want to become not what we let ourselves become.
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:13.72 We own the course.
01:45:13.72 --> 01:45:25.000 And with every decision that we make we actualize ourselves would become what we choose.
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:35.40 Swine or saints.
01:45:35.40 --> 01:45:49.56 So when you make decisions every decision think about where that decision leads and what
01:45:49.56 --> 01:45:56.60 that decision will make you become.
01:45:56.60 --> 01:46:06.28 And then self-determined.
01:46:06.28 --> 01:46:12.60 What will make you a better person.
01:46:12.60 --> 01:46:20.12 And even in situations where you feel you have no choice at all, you still have one last
01:46:20.12 --> 01:46:31.88 freedom and that is to choose your own attitude in any given set of circumstances.
01:46:31.88 --> 01:46:36.76 Keep that choice.
01:46:36.76 --> 01:46:42.84 Keep that freedom that hard choice.
01:46:42.84 --> 01:46:49.04 The disciplined choice.
01:46:49.04 --> 01:47:02.80 With the discipline to make the right choice maintain your freedom.
01:47:02.80 --> 01:47:19.72 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:47:19.72 --> 01:47:20.72 Is it an crazy home?
01:47:20.72 --> 01:47:22.88 I can't help but think of this.
01:47:22.88 --> 01:47:31.60 Like where how they talk about the SS officers, the Nazis, the guys there who are just
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:32.60 savages.
01:47:32.60 --> 01:47:37.28 Obviously, but are they really savages as people?
01:47:37.28 --> 01:47:39.52 Or is it a circumstantial thing?
01:47:39.52 --> 01:47:44.84 I know they're trained to regard the Jews or these groups of people as being any them and
01:47:44.84 --> 01:47:47.36 all this stuff.
01:47:47.36 --> 01:47:49.48 Are they savages as individuals?
01:47:49.48 --> 01:47:52.20 Because it takes a savage to do some of this stuff.
01:47:52.20 --> 01:47:58.36 Especially grabbing a baby and smashing his books and scolds against the wall.
01:47:58.36 --> 01:48:01.56 That's subhuman behavior.
01:48:01.56 --> 01:48:05.88 When he goes home, he has kids.
01:48:05.88 --> 01:48:10.48 He's like, I don't care if these kids ultimately, if their heads get in, I'm sure he's
01:48:10.48 --> 01:48:11.48 not like that.
01:48:11.48 --> 01:48:15.64 I'm sure he's just a normal person who just be just as weak as all of us if your
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:19.48 kid stubs its toe and starts crying.
01:48:19.48 --> 01:48:20.88 Yeah, well, we're going to explore.
01:48:20.88 --> 01:48:25.72 I've got some books in the queue to explore the other side of this and they're very
01:48:25.72 --> 01:48:27.68 revealing about some of that.
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:38.68 But again, it's you're right, that some of these guys were normal, right?
01:48:38.68 --> 01:48:44.08 Some of these Nazis were normal and they were doing their job and that's one of the worst,
01:48:44.08 --> 01:48:51.12 there's a whole argument on whether that even is allowable.
01:48:51.12 --> 01:48:56.48 If you're doing your job and I'll tell you what, in the US military, that doesn't work.
01:48:56.48 --> 01:48:58.16 That's an excuse that we don't have.
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:03.44 You can't say, hey, I got ordered to do this thing that was against the law or against ethical
01:49:03.44 --> 01:49:05.04 values doesn't matter.
01:49:05.04 --> 01:49:06.44 I still can't do it.
01:49:06.44 --> 01:49:07.44 That's not an excuse.
01:49:07.44 --> 01:49:11.56 And that came directly from this attitude that Nazi said, hey, I was just falling
01:49:11.56 --> 01:49:12.56 orders.
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:13.72 Hey, what's my father's just falling orders?
01:49:13.72 --> 01:49:15.12 No, actually, you can't say that.
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:16.80 You know, I'll have to say that.
01:49:16.80 --> 01:49:22.56 So as far as the normalcy, sure, they might have been normal when they went home, but that
01:49:22.56 --> 01:49:24.36 doesn't remove their guilt at all.
01:49:24.36 --> 01:49:25.36 Yeah, fully.
01:49:25.36 --> 01:49:28.44 You can't take a baby and smash it's head against the wall.
01:49:28.44 --> 01:49:32.24 You don't get a pass on that one, whether you ordered to do it or not.
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:36.72 There's certain moral standards that exist and you can't violate them.
01:49:36.72 --> 01:49:37.92 And if you do, you're guilty.
01:49:37.92 --> 01:49:39.60 It doesn't matter what else you did.
01:49:39.60 --> 01:49:45.08 Back then, who was kind of the authority on that?
01:49:45.08 --> 01:49:48.12 Where the moral was it like a global thing?
01:49:48.12 --> 01:49:52.76 Or is it because obviously Hitler would be like, hey, whatever?
01:49:52.76 --> 01:49:56.88 Well, there's different societies that had different viewpoints.
01:49:56.88 --> 01:50:04.04 Obviously, and not to, hence the war, the Nazis and the Japanese both felt, okay, we can
01:50:04.04 --> 01:50:06.40 do what we need to do to dominate.
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:10.28 And whether that's the rap and an king or whether that's the concentration camps and the
01:50:10.28 --> 01:50:14.44 final solution, both those things were in their societies.
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:18.64 Now there was, of course, there was people inside those societies.
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:21.32 I don't know, I don't know of any Japanese.
01:50:21.32 --> 01:50:23.36 I'm sure there were some Japanese that were against them.
01:50:23.36 --> 01:50:27.44 And even when we'd read the rap and an king, there was a Nazi in an an king, remember
01:50:27.44 --> 01:50:29.08 that sheltered people.
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:30.64 So there's an example.
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:31.64 Here's a guy now.
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:36.20 He didn't know what was going on with the final solution back in Germany.
01:50:36.20 --> 01:50:38.84 At least it doesn't appear that way.
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:46.52 But yeah, this is what makes morality and ethical decision making so challenging.
01:50:46.52 --> 01:50:52.20 But there is, in my opinion, you know, a certain standard moral code that human beings
01:50:52.20 --> 01:50:54.04 live by.
01:50:54.04 --> 01:51:00.24 And that is a universal, relatively, you know, now there's now a lot of people.
01:51:00.24 --> 01:51:01.68 I should actually say it's universal.
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:06.16 There's the way that I believe that there's morals and standards that human beings
01:51:06.16 --> 01:51:07.16 live by.
01:51:07.16 --> 01:51:12.36 And when you start stepping outside those bounds, you're going on the wrong side.
01:51:12.36 --> 01:51:15.84 Yeah, and like anything, man, it's like obviously a spectrum.
01:51:15.84 --> 01:51:19.56 And then what you're talking about that universal line that you cross, it's actually
01:51:19.56 --> 01:51:23.84 when you really look at the line, it's like a universal gray area of, and then you really
01:51:23.84 --> 01:51:25.08 look closer.
01:51:25.08 --> 01:51:31.36 But I think that the circumstances don't really fall within the confines of that gray area
01:51:31.36 --> 01:51:32.36 very often.
01:51:32.36 --> 01:51:34.92 So it's easy to be like, that's obviously right.
01:51:34.92 --> 01:51:35.92 That's obviously wrong.
01:51:35.92 --> 01:51:39.04 But then everyone's in all these gray areas of emergent.
01:51:39.04 --> 01:51:41.68 And it's like this big debate and it depends on who you are.
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:42.68 Yeah.
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:45.40 I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas to be honest with you.
01:51:45.40 --> 01:51:47.92 Like in my fall pattern, I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas.
01:51:47.92 --> 01:51:50.80 I spend time because to me, it is pretty obvious.
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:57.44 Like when you're ISIS and you're systematically raping 12 year old girls and boys, you
01:51:57.44 --> 01:51:58.76 don't get to live.
01:51:58.76 --> 01:51:59.76 That doesn't work.
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:00.76 Yeah.
01:52:00.76 --> 01:52:02.76 That's not part of my deal over here.
01:52:02.76 --> 01:52:03.76 You die.
01:52:03.76 --> 01:52:08.04 And when you take people and you put them in cages and you burn them to death, you don't
01:52:08.04 --> 01:52:09.28 get to do that.
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:12.88 Like these Nazis that are putting people in the context, you don't get to do that.
01:52:12.88 --> 01:52:13.88 No.
01:52:13.88 --> 01:52:16.24 We go to war, we fight, and we win.
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:17.64 That's the way it works.
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:21.64 Now these gray areas that you're talking about, I don't mess around in those gray areas.
01:52:21.64 --> 01:52:22.64 Yeah.
01:52:22.64 --> 01:52:26.52 I think there's too much, there's turbulence in there.
01:52:26.52 --> 01:52:31.08 And a lot of times you look at it from the outside and it's hard to tell what it is.
01:52:31.08 --> 01:52:33.04 What it actually is happening in there.
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:34.04 Right?
01:52:34.04 --> 01:52:36.44 I'll, and maybe that's not the best policy.
01:52:36.44 --> 01:52:41.08 But I won't escalate something personally until I see it go outside the lines of what
01:52:41.08 --> 01:52:42.08 I deem to be.
01:52:42.08 --> 01:52:43.08 Okay.
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:44.08 Yeah.
01:52:44.08 --> 01:52:45.32 Once you get outside those lines, you're done.
01:52:45.32 --> 01:52:51.76 Well, thankfully you're, you know, a little bit smart in a way where, you know, whether
01:52:51.76 --> 01:52:55.80 you name these things or not, there's always a particular standard that you go by, you
01:52:55.80 --> 01:52:56.80 know.
01:52:56.80 --> 01:53:01.20 So just like the difference between killing someone and when someone says murder, you
01:53:01.20 --> 01:53:04.20 know, murder is clearly defined.
01:53:04.20 --> 01:53:11.20 So if you murder someone, like killing someone is this broad thing, you kill them accidentally
01:53:11.20 --> 01:53:13.60 killed them, you killed them after planning.
01:53:13.60 --> 01:53:14.60 Yeah.
01:53:14.60 --> 01:53:15.60 There's a million.
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:18.96 The revenge and all that, you know, that's killing someone, but murder is defined.
01:53:18.96 --> 01:53:24.80 You know, so, well, somebody asked me when I, I would attempt for a second time and
01:53:24.80 --> 01:53:28.92 someone asked me something along the lines of, well, who defines these rules, which is
01:53:28.92 --> 01:53:30.52 basically what you just asked me.
01:53:30.52 --> 01:53:33.72 And I think it actually, there is an answer to who defines these rules in warfare.
01:53:33.72 --> 01:53:34.72 It's the law of armed conflict.
01:53:34.72 --> 01:53:36.16 It's like a Geneva convention.
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:37.16 We follow those laws.
01:53:37.16 --> 01:53:38.16 Right.
01:53:38.16 --> 01:53:39.80 They're very clearly defined what you can and can't do.
01:53:39.80 --> 01:53:40.80 That's it.
01:53:40.80 --> 01:53:41.80 Next question.
01:53:41.80 --> 01:53:42.80 Yeah.
01:53:42.80 --> 01:53:46.40 And I mean, unless you straight up disagree with the Geneva convention, you know, and
01:53:46.40 --> 01:53:50.60 because of your personal moral code, but as long as you have again, a standard that you're
01:53:50.60 --> 01:53:53.80 going by that'll reduce the gray areas by a lot.
01:53:53.80 --> 01:53:58.04 And still, we're going to be there, but it's easier to operate in black and white when
01:53:58.04 --> 01:53:59.04 you have standards.
01:53:59.04 --> 01:54:03.68 And it won't always be easy, but, you know, it's like, well, let me, let me, let me,
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:04.68 let me do this.
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:06.68 This, this, when we start getting in the gray area, and you're sitting here saying,
01:54:06.68 --> 01:54:09.28 that I'm all black and white, and that's, I'm actually saying that.
01:54:09.28 --> 01:54:10.84 Like, okay, I want you across this line.
01:54:10.84 --> 01:54:11.84 But guess what?
01:54:11.84 --> 01:54:13.12 Those lines can get blurry too.
01:54:13.12 --> 01:54:19.52 Yeah, because I heard about a guy that was on a documentary who is, he was, he was
01:54:19.52 --> 01:54:23.08 a Western journalist of some kind, and I got to watch this documentary, I'm sure someone
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:24.08 will tell us what it is.
01:54:24.08 --> 01:54:25.76 But somebody else told me about it.
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:33.16 The Western journalist, he's embedded with insurgence in Iraq.
01:54:33.16 --> 01:54:34.70 And he's filming.
01:54:34.70 --> 01:54:37.24 And we're going out in attacking coalition forces.
01:54:37.24 --> 01:54:38.24 Yeah.
01:54:38.24 --> 01:54:39.24 Right.
01:54:39.24 --> 01:54:42.96 And I guess he was, while he's doing it, you know, he's trying to get a story
01:54:42.96 --> 01:54:46.40 and do his job, but then all of a sudden they're attacking coalition forces, right?
01:54:46.40 --> 01:54:47.40 Now there's a gray area.
01:54:47.40 --> 01:54:52.52 Now let's say, if you want to take that example to the extreme, if we're in a fire
01:54:52.52 --> 01:54:58.72 fight, and I see a guy with a camera who's wearing a press badge following an insurgent.
01:54:58.72 --> 01:54:59.72 Right.
01:54:59.72 --> 01:55:02.96 I mean, I think I'm going to work out good for him.
01:55:02.96 --> 01:55:06.72 Because it's not like I'm going to say, okay, well, you know, he's clearly with insurgents.
01:55:06.72 --> 01:55:12.16 But what I'm saying is that's, that's one example of many that that you could get into,
01:55:12.16 --> 01:55:16.76 where also another thing that happened in Iraq a lot was people change sides.
01:55:16.76 --> 01:55:19.76 And then went from supporting the terrorist, to supporting the coalition, and then back
01:55:19.76 --> 01:55:21.24 again, and then back again.
01:55:21.24 --> 01:55:26.04 So how do you balance those?
01:55:26.04 --> 01:55:31.08 And I'll tell you how I balance them was how can we achieve our mission?
01:55:31.08 --> 01:55:34.36 And that sounds like one of those, hey, mission focus.
01:55:34.36 --> 01:55:35.36 But it's true.
01:55:35.36 --> 01:55:41.88 I look at, okay, this guy, you know, a year ago was being targeted by coalition forces
01:55:41.88 --> 01:55:43.80 for being a bad guy.
01:55:43.80 --> 01:55:46.04 Now he has changed course.
01:55:46.04 --> 01:55:47.04 So what am I supposed to do?
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:48.04 Still prosecute him?
01:55:48.04 --> 01:55:50.44 Or is he going to help us achieve our mission of overall victory?
01:55:50.44 --> 01:55:52.04 I guess what I'm going to do?
01:55:52.04 --> 01:55:57.76 I'm going to cut him some moral slack because we're going to win.
01:55:57.76 --> 01:55:59.16 So those are hard things to.
01:55:59.16 --> 01:56:00.32 But that's exactly what I mean.
01:56:00.32 --> 01:56:06.08 They'll see the standard in your case became the overall mission.
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:07.08 Yes.
01:56:07.08 --> 01:56:09.56 So you know, you have that saying it's not like just some guy floating down the road
01:56:09.56 --> 01:56:12.44 through life being like, I don't feel good about that right there.
01:56:12.44 --> 01:56:13.44 So I feel this way.
01:56:13.44 --> 01:56:14.44 So I'm going to do it.
01:56:14.44 --> 01:56:17.36 It's not that it's like the standard very concrete attached to it.
01:56:17.36 --> 01:56:18.36 Still great areas.
01:56:18.36 --> 01:56:20.80 Gunny emerged, but like I said, it just reduces that great area.
01:56:20.80 --> 01:56:21.80 Yep.
01:56:21.80 --> 01:56:26.16 And then the bottom line is, this is why leadership is hard.
01:56:26.16 --> 01:56:27.16 Yes.
01:56:27.16 --> 01:56:31.72 So the whole idea of leadership, whether it's in combat or whether it's in the business
01:56:31.72 --> 01:56:34.48 world or whether it's part of a team or whether it's part of a family or whether it's
01:56:34.48 --> 01:56:38.20 in a concentration camp or whether it's in a prisoner of war camp.
01:56:38.20 --> 01:56:39.68 Leadership is hard.
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:45.000 There's gray areas like when Captain Plum was saying, hey, he got told an order, you
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.84 know, make communications with this guy at all costs.
01:56:49.84 --> 01:56:50.84 At all costs.
01:56:50.84 --> 01:56:54.56 That means I'm going to get beaten and tortured and died by the guards to get this guy
01:56:54.56 --> 01:56:55.56 this piece of communication.
01:56:55.56 --> 01:56:57.12 Is he going to follow that?
01:56:57.12 --> 01:56:58.12 Yes.
01:56:58.12 --> 01:56:59.28 No.
01:56:59.28 --> 01:57:00.80 He had to make a judgment.
01:57:00.80 --> 01:57:03.36 And so you know what, though that doesn't make sense.
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:04.84 That doesn't make sense.
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:07.36 So this gray area that went outside the bounds of the gray area.
01:57:07.36 --> 01:57:09.40 And he said, no, I'll do my best.
01:57:09.40 --> 01:57:16.04 I understand that it's critical, but I'm going to stay within me staying alive.
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:17.28 Right?
01:57:17.28 --> 01:57:20.04 So that is what makes leadership hard.
01:57:20.04 --> 01:57:25.40 Is you have to constantly make these decisions where there's their gray area and you're
01:57:25.40 --> 01:57:26.40 doing your best.
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:30.92 And that's, that's again, to me it was always, I love that.
01:57:30.92 --> 01:57:32.08 I love that about leadership.
01:57:32.08 --> 01:57:34.16 I love weighing those decisions out.
01:57:34.16 --> 01:57:37.56 And I love discussing them with my guys up and down the chain of command and saying, hey,
01:57:37.56 --> 01:57:38.56 here's where we're at.
01:57:38.56 --> 01:57:39.92 Let me tell you exactly where we're at.
01:57:39.92 --> 01:57:41.64 You know, I'll use life.
01:57:41.64 --> 01:57:43.44 I'll be, you know, life here's what's going on.
01:57:43.44 --> 01:57:44.44 This is the situation.
01:57:44.44 --> 01:57:45.44 What do you think?
01:57:45.44 --> 01:57:46.44 Yeah.
01:57:46.44 --> 01:57:47.44 Well, I think that's okay.
01:57:47.44 --> 01:57:48.44 That's a good point.
01:57:48.44 --> 01:57:49.44 But did you think about that?
01:57:49.44 --> 01:57:50.44 Oh, that's a good one.
01:57:50.44 --> 01:57:51.44 You know what I mean?
01:57:51.44 --> 01:57:52.44 We're going to have those conversations.
01:57:52.44 --> 01:57:56.36 And I had never had any problem opening my mind up to these various opinions that people had.
01:57:56.36 --> 01:58:03.20 And I think as a leader, that's a huge piece of building trust up and down the chain of
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:06.44 command is when you have an open mind to discuss things with people.
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:12.80 And that also double gravitational pull echo Charles helps you build the relationship.
01:58:12.80 --> 01:58:13.80 Yeah.
01:58:13.80 --> 01:58:15.84 Helps you build the relationship and helps you say, oh, you know what?
01:58:15.84 --> 01:58:18.32 Like, what's the minute I'm in there and I'm talking to him like, hey, I got we got
01:58:18.32 --> 01:58:19.32 a gray area here.
01:58:19.32 --> 01:58:24.28 You know, we got a customer that is threatening to put us on the help, but we didn't do
01:58:24.28 --> 01:58:25.28 anything wrong.
01:58:25.28 --> 01:58:27.88 How do you think we should handle it?
01:58:27.88 --> 01:58:28.88 Okay.
01:58:28.88 --> 01:58:32.92 Well, you think we should just tell him, go ahead and put it on Yelp.
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:35.56 We don't care and we'll go to Yelp and we'll talk to him.
01:58:35.56 --> 01:58:36.92 That might be the good answer.
01:58:36.92 --> 01:58:40.84 But also it might be good to say, bro, wait, why are you so mad?
01:58:40.84 --> 01:58:41.84 Customer?
01:58:41.84 --> 01:58:42.84 Let's talk.
01:58:42.84 --> 01:58:43.84 Hey, we want to refund you.
01:58:43.84 --> 01:58:46.04 We want to take care of you because our customers are important to us.
01:58:46.04 --> 01:58:47.60 Maybe you'll give us a positive thing on you.
01:58:47.60 --> 01:58:48.60 You know what I'm saying?
01:58:48.60 --> 01:58:49.84 There's all this gray area.
01:58:49.84 --> 01:58:50.84 Yeah.
01:58:50.84 --> 01:58:53.88 And if you have an open mind to discuss things with your team.
01:58:53.88 --> 01:58:55.52 Open down the chain of command.
01:58:55.52 --> 01:58:58.52 You know what you'll do is you'll get in that gray area.
01:58:58.52 --> 01:59:00.52 You'll start to get clarity.
01:59:00.52 --> 01:59:03.88 You'll start to get clarity and you'll start to see better.
01:59:03.88 --> 01:59:12.60 And you can move through the gray area without being without being so decisive that in a gray
01:59:12.60 --> 01:59:14.84 area, you don't know if it's black or white, right?
01:59:14.84 --> 01:59:18.60 So if you decide as the leader, I'm going black.
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:19.60 Going black.
01:59:19.60 --> 01:59:22.64 Then when the gray area clears up, it was white that you should have gone with.
01:59:22.64 --> 01:59:23.64 Yeah.
01:59:23.64 --> 01:59:24.64 You don't need to do that.
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:27.20 In many cases, you can say, okay, I'm going to lean a little bit towards the black
01:59:27.20 --> 01:59:28.20 because that's what I'm feeling.
01:59:28.20 --> 01:59:30.68 And then all of a sudden you start moving there and you start seeing that, no, this
01:59:30.68 --> 01:59:32.20 is going to be a white decision.
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:33.20 Yeah.
01:59:33.20 --> 01:59:34.20 Okay, I can recover from that.
01:59:34.20 --> 01:59:38.60 I can move backwards and repair what decision was made.
01:59:38.60 --> 01:59:42.16 And the best way to do that is say, hey, guys, here's the situation.
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:44.84 I thought that black was going to be the right decision.
01:59:44.84 --> 01:59:46.000 I started leaning in that direction.
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.88 I was wrong.
01:59:47.88 --> 01:59:52.32 Now I see that white is the right answer and we're going with white.
01:59:52.32 --> 01:59:54.68 Does anyone have any questions about that?
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:56.64 Does everyone understand why I did that?
01:59:56.64 --> 01:59:57.64 Oh, you don't understand why?
01:59:57.64 --> 01:59:58.64 Let me explain it to you.
01:59:58.64 --> 01:59:59.64 Here's what I thought.
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:00.64 Here's what I saw.
02:00:00.64 --> 02:00:02.28 Next time, do you want me to wet contact you?
02:00:02.28 --> 02:00:03.84 So you could, that's what I'm talking about.
02:00:03.84 --> 02:00:06.88 And by the way, when I'm doing that, I'm building relationships with my team, which is
02:00:06.88 --> 02:00:08.64 what I want to do.
02:00:08.64 --> 02:00:10.92 I just was talking to leader the other day.
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:12.68 And I told him and reiterated something.
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.40 I'm saying, over and over again.
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:19.000 But people that did things for me and the teams that were in the Army, the Marine Corps,
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.28 in the SEAL teams, in my platoon, up and down the chain of command, doesn't matter.
02:00:22.28 --> 02:00:24.76 99.9% of it.
02:00:24.76 --> 02:00:28.36 Wasn't because I had some kind of rank or privilege over them.
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:31.04 It was always because I had a good relationship with people.
02:00:31.04 --> 02:00:34.92 And when you build that good relationship with people, that's what it's all about.
02:00:34.92 --> 02:00:36.96 Then they do things for you.
02:00:36.96 --> 02:00:37.96 And you know what?
02:00:37.96 --> 02:00:39.40 You do things for them, too.
02:00:39.40 --> 02:00:42.48 It's not a one way street that I'm talking about, because you won't build any relationships
02:00:42.48 --> 02:00:43.76 if you're building a one way street.
02:00:43.76 --> 02:00:47.36 No one's going to be your friend after you just take advantage of them over and over again.
02:00:47.36 --> 02:00:51.92 Like those people that call you only when they need something from you.
02:00:51.92 --> 02:00:56.04 Now I actually don't have a problem with that, because I don't communicate with a lot of people.
02:00:56.04 --> 02:01:00.36 I communicate on social media with a bunch of different people.
02:01:00.36 --> 02:01:01.36 They'll get you there too.
02:01:01.36 --> 02:01:06.52 But as far as, if, like, when one of my buddies calls me up and says, hey, I need this favor.
02:01:06.52 --> 02:01:08.000 I'm like, cool, on it.
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.16 I haven't talked to him for nine months.
02:01:10.16 --> 02:01:12.56 He's only calling me because he needs something from me.
02:01:12.56 --> 02:01:13.56 Doesn't matter.
02:01:13.56 --> 02:01:15.64 People do that with me all the time and it's cool.
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:16.84 Now it's in a big group of people.
02:01:16.84 --> 02:01:20.000 It's like six people in the world.
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.76 And those same six people, they don't call the wish me happy birthday.
02:01:22.76 --> 02:01:27.32 They don't call them tell me, you know, Merry Christmas.
02:01:27.32 --> 02:01:30.000 They call me up and say, hey, I need this from you.
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000 Can you do it?
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.36 I'm like, got it.
02:01:32.36 --> 02:01:33.36 No factor.
02:01:33.36 --> 02:01:35.92 Do you even have a birthday negative?
02:01:35.92 --> 02:01:37.36 I have a maybe factor in the day.
02:01:37.36 --> 02:01:39.92 So funny.
02:01:39.92 --> 02:01:44.88 I'm just trying to imagine someone calling you to wish you have a birthday.
02:01:44.88 --> 02:01:48.40 I mean, maybe like your wife was at awkward when I got in the civilian sector and people
02:01:48.40 --> 02:01:50.40 would be like, when's your birthday?
02:01:50.40 --> 02:01:51.40 I'm going to be like, why won't you?
02:01:51.40 --> 02:01:52.40 What are you talking about?
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:54.40 Why are you trying to get my personal information?
02:01:54.40 --> 02:01:55.40 I'm going to attack you.
02:01:55.40 --> 02:01:58.40 Yeah.
02:01:58.40 --> 02:02:00.40 Hey, what's the inner you?
02:02:00.40 --> 02:02:01.40 No.
02:02:01.40 --> 02:02:02.40 You know, that's the thing.
02:02:02.40 --> 02:02:05.40 What was the other funny thing about the birthday deal?
02:02:05.40 --> 02:02:06.40 Well, that's a getting present.
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:08.40 I'm not good with presents.
02:02:08.40 --> 02:02:09.40 Yeah, man.
02:02:09.40 --> 02:02:10.40 But don't get me any presents.
02:02:10.40 --> 02:02:11.40 Right.
02:02:11.40 --> 02:02:12.40 Because I don't want what you got me.
02:02:12.40 --> 02:02:13.40 Yeah.
02:02:13.40 --> 02:02:15.40 If I want something I already have to get it.
02:02:15.40 --> 02:02:16.40 Yeah.
02:02:16.40 --> 02:02:19.40 And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to be appreciated.
02:02:19.40 --> 02:02:22.40 There's a one gift that my wife got me one time.
02:02:22.40 --> 02:02:27.40 And I haven't, I've been thinking about why I haven't talked about this particular whole situation.
02:02:27.40 --> 02:02:29.40 And that's, there's a band called the white stripes.
02:02:29.40 --> 02:02:30.40 Sure.
02:02:30.40 --> 02:02:31.40 Light stripes.
02:02:31.40 --> 02:02:32.40 And the white stripes.
02:02:32.40 --> 02:02:34.40 Jack white, Meg white.
02:02:34.40 --> 02:02:36.40 The white stripes are awesome.
02:02:36.40 --> 02:02:38.40 They're an awesome band.
02:02:38.40 --> 02:02:41.40 And there's so many layers with the white stripes.
02:02:41.40 --> 02:02:44.40 The first of all, there's, I'll tell you two layers that I love about the white stripes.
02:02:44.40 --> 02:02:53.40 Number one, all their clothing, guitars, drums, keyboards, everything that they have on stage.
02:02:53.40 --> 02:02:59.40 And everything that they have on their record albums, everything that they have is either red, black, or white.
02:02:59.40 --> 02:03:01.40 On all the records since day one.
02:03:01.40 --> 02:03:02.40 That's number one.
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:11.40 Number two, they only have three sounds in any other songs at any one time.
02:03:11.40 --> 02:03:15.40 So those three sounds could be drums, vocals, guitar.
02:03:15.40 --> 02:03:18.40 They could be drums, keyboards, vocals.
02:03:18.40 --> 02:03:21.40 They could be keyboards, guitar, vocals.
02:03:21.40 --> 02:03:23.40 But they only have three sounds at any one time.
02:03:23.40 --> 02:03:24.40 Vocals is one of the songs.
02:03:24.40 --> 02:03:25.40 Oh, this is one of the songs.
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:25.40 Yeah.
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:27.40 There's only two people in the band.
02:03:27.40 --> 02:03:31.40 Anyways, the white stripes is an awesome band.
02:03:31.40 --> 02:03:35.40 And my wife bought me tickets to go see the white stripes.
02:03:35.40 --> 02:03:37.40 Now, I didn't even think about.
02:03:37.40 --> 02:03:39.40 I never pay attention to when bands are playing or whatever.
02:03:39.40 --> 02:03:45.40 So my, I was, I was, I don't use this term very often, but I was overjoyed.
02:03:45.40 --> 02:03:48.40 That she got me tickets to the white stripes.
02:03:48.40 --> 02:03:50.40 I was so stoked.
02:03:50.40 --> 02:03:54.40 And then Meg White had some issues.
02:03:54.40 --> 02:03:56.40 And they canceled the whole tour and they never played again.
02:03:56.40 --> 02:03:59.40 They were like a couple weeks away from being in San Diego.
02:03:59.40 --> 02:04:00.40 Where I was going to go see the white stripes.
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:03.40 So the question is, ultimately, ultimately,
02:04:03.40 --> 02:04:04.40 Grand scheme of things.
02:04:04.40 --> 02:04:06.40 Was that a good gift to give, Joko?
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:08.40 That was an awesome gift to give me.
02:04:08.40 --> 02:04:11.40 So it was, it was the thought that counts in this case.
02:04:11.40 --> 02:04:13.40 It was a beautiful thought.
02:04:13.40 --> 02:04:16.40 And I was, and I couldn't believe she thought of it.
02:04:16.40 --> 02:04:20.40 Because normally it's like, oh, you got me a sweater from some story that I hate.
02:04:20.40 --> 02:04:24.40 No, I'm really hard to shop for.
02:04:24.40 --> 02:04:26.40 I'm really, if I want something, I have it.
02:04:26.40 --> 02:04:28.40 And I don't want that much.
02:04:28.40 --> 02:04:30.40 So it's like, oh, I want something I have it.
02:04:30.40 --> 02:04:33.40 Like once every 18 months, I want something.
02:04:33.40 --> 02:04:35.40 And then I get it.
02:04:35.40 --> 02:04:38.40 I'll get you like a new t-shirt or something. You wear that one.
02:04:38.40 --> 02:04:40.40 No, this t-shirt's fine. Don't get me a new one.
02:04:40.40 --> 02:04:42.40 This one works good.
02:04:42.40 --> 02:04:47.40 So, yeah, that's, yeah, it seems like a good gift.
02:04:47.40 --> 02:04:49.40 It's just going off on a tangent.
02:04:49.40 --> 02:04:52.40 I feel like you went off on a tangent.
02:04:52.40 --> 02:04:54.40 You know why? Because I was listening to the white stripes the other day.
02:04:54.40 --> 02:04:57.40 I was thinking, I never give the white stripes the props that they deserve.
02:04:57.40 --> 02:05:00.40 Yeah, I'm a jack white, the props that he deserves.
02:05:00.40 --> 02:05:02.40 As a singer songwriter.
02:05:02.40 --> 02:05:03.40 Aren't they brother and sister?
02:05:03.40 --> 02:05:04.40 They're not.
02:05:04.40 --> 02:05:05.40 They're not a big league.
02:05:05.40 --> 02:05:06.40 Allegedly.
02:05:06.40 --> 02:05:07.40 They were actually husband and wife.
02:05:07.40 --> 02:05:09.40 They got divorced, but they always claimed to be brother's sister.
02:05:09.40 --> 02:05:10.40 It's my little sister, Meg White.
02:05:10.40 --> 02:05:11.40 More like.
02:05:11.40 --> 02:05:12.40 Or this is my big sister.
02:05:12.40 --> 02:05:13.40 That's right.
02:05:13.40 --> 02:05:13.40 Yeah.
02:05:13.40 --> 02:05:14.40 It's what he always said.
02:05:14.40 --> 02:05:15.40 Thank you.
02:05:15.40 --> 02:05:16.40 It's good, man.
02:05:16.40 --> 02:05:17.40 Cool.
02:05:17.40 --> 02:05:22.40 Well, the original point was these crazy savage type people.
02:05:22.40 --> 02:05:26.40 Maybe normal people other than their crazy job.
02:05:26.40 --> 02:05:27.40 Yeah.
02:05:27.40 --> 02:05:29.40 And what's, and I'm, but I'm not saying so.
02:05:29.40 --> 02:05:30.40 It's cool.
02:05:30.40 --> 02:05:31.40 I'm not saying so.
02:05:31.40 --> 02:05:34.40 And this is your, your, your accountable for your actions.
02:05:34.40 --> 02:05:35.40 Yeah.
02:05:35.40 --> 02:05:36.40 You're going to say, well, cool.
02:05:36.40 --> 02:05:37.40 You are.
02:05:37.40 --> 02:05:37.40 Yeah.
02:05:37.40 --> 02:05:38.40 Yeah.
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:41.40 And that's something from any leadership position.
02:05:41.40 --> 02:05:42.40 You need to be aware of.
02:05:42.40 --> 02:05:45.40 And when I say new leadership position, I mean, you as a front line trooper.
02:05:45.40 --> 02:05:48.40 Because if you as a front line trooper is getting told do something that you know as morally
02:05:48.40 --> 02:05:50.40 ethically or legally wrong and you still do it.
02:05:50.40 --> 02:05:53.40 It's on you sure you can point to finger and blame the higher ups and the higher
02:05:53.40 --> 02:05:56.40 ups should be burned to if they told you do something that was wrong.
02:05:56.40 --> 02:05:57.40 Yeah.
02:05:57.40 --> 02:05:59.40 But you need to be accountable for what you did.
02:05:59.40 --> 02:06:00.40 And that's all there is to it.
02:06:00.40 --> 02:06:00.40 Yeah.
02:06:00.40 --> 02:06:02.40 That's a rough tour.
02:06:02.40 --> 02:06:04.40 No one wants to play that game.
02:06:04.40 --> 02:06:06.40 The Nazis wanted to play that game.
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:07.40 Oh, it's not mine.
02:06:07.40 --> 02:06:08.40 I was ordered to do this.
02:06:08.40 --> 02:06:09.40 Can't do that.
02:06:09.40 --> 02:06:10.40 Can't say that.
02:06:10.40 --> 02:06:11.40 Don't get that excuse.
02:06:11.40 --> 02:06:12.40 Yeah.
02:06:12.40 --> 02:06:13.40 You don't get the, I was a good person.
02:06:13.40 --> 02:06:14.40 And I took care of my kids.
02:06:14.40 --> 02:06:17.40 Even though I was shoving people into into a gas chamber.
02:06:17.40 --> 02:06:18.40 You don't get to play that game.
02:06:18.40 --> 02:06:19.40 No.
02:06:19.40 --> 02:06:20.40 Yeah, man.
02:06:20.40 --> 02:06:21.40 Too much.
02:06:21.40 --> 02:06:23.40 But there was a small little documentary on blind.
02:06:23.40 --> 02:06:24.40 I don't know.
02:06:24.40 --> 02:06:25.40 I don't watch the whole thing.
02:06:25.40 --> 02:06:28.40 But it was about the executioner in the middle east somewhere, you know,
02:06:28.40 --> 02:06:31.40 when these countries were, you know, he has his sword.
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:32.40 Yep.
02:06:32.40 --> 02:06:35.40 And it's his job, you know, and he's just straight up executioner.
02:06:35.40 --> 02:06:36.40 Yeah.
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:36.40 That's it.
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:37.40 That's just his job.
02:06:37.40 --> 02:06:38.40 My dad's a job by the way.
02:06:38.40 --> 02:06:39.40 And he's like, yeah.
02:06:39.40 --> 02:06:40.40 It wasn't old school.
02:06:40.40 --> 02:06:41.40 Oh, it's on YouTube.
02:06:41.40 --> 02:06:42.40 Yeah.
02:06:42.40 --> 02:06:43.40 Like last week.
02:06:43.40 --> 02:06:44.40 Yeah.
02:06:44.40 --> 02:06:44.40 And there.
02:06:44.40 --> 02:06:47.40 But it's funny because the whole feel of the documentary was just real.
02:06:47.40 --> 02:06:48.40 Like, oh, yeah.
02:06:48.40 --> 02:06:49.40 This guy has a cool job.
02:06:49.40 --> 02:06:52.40 And he's like slicing people's heads off with great precision.
02:06:52.40 --> 02:06:54.40 And he's so good at his job.
02:06:54.40 --> 02:06:56.40 You know, here's his family.
02:06:56.40 --> 02:06:59.40 And they're loving, you know, and they're, you know, he's playing with his kids.
02:06:59.40 --> 02:07:00.40 It's like all this stuff.
02:07:00.40 --> 02:07:03.40 It's just weird, man.
02:07:03.40 --> 02:07:04.40 Anyway.
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:04.40 Yeah.
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:06.40 There's, there's,
02:07:06.40 --> 02:07:08.40 another culture.
02:07:08.40 --> 02:07:09.40 Yeah.
02:07:09.40 --> 02:07:10.40 It's weird.
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:12.40 A lot of gray areas in that one too.
02:07:12.40 --> 02:07:13.40 But man.
02:07:13.40 --> 02:07:14.40 Indeed.
02:07:14.40 --> 02:07:15.40 Kind of.
02:07:15.40 --> 02:07:16.40 Anyway.
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:17.40 Or not.
02:07:17.40 --> 02:07:21.40 I feel like we should go into the support.
02:07:21.40 --> 02:07:22.40 Yeah.
02:07:22.40 --> 02:07:24.40 We should go into the support.
02:07:24.40 --> 02:07:26.40 So support is one of those good things.
02:07:26.40 --> 02:07:27.40 Very dynamic.
02:07:27.40 --> 02:07:31.40 Supporting others supporting yourself.
02:07:31.40 --> 02:07:35.40 Supporting others and yourself, which is a separate category of support.
02:07:35.40 --> 02:07:36.40 My opinion.
02:07:36.40 --> 02:07:38.40 So there's yourself, others, and yourself.
02:07:38.40 --> 02:07:39.40 And others.
02:07:39.40 --> 02:07:41.40 That's not the category.
02:07:41.40 --> 02:07:44.40 When we talk about on it, we're talking about all three categories.
02:07:44.40 --> 02:07:45.40 Support yourself.
02:07:45.40 --> 02:07:47.40 By with supplementation.
02:07:47.40 --> 02:07:49.40 And we talk about supplementation all the time.
02:07:49.40 --> 02:07:50.40 But.
02:07:50.40 --> 02:07:52.40 You know, you talk about supplementation.
02:07:52.40 --> 02:07:55.40 Well, you're the one who turned it, turned me on to it.
02:07:55.40 --> 02:07:58.40 So actually some of it.
02:07:58.40 --> 02:08:02.40 I took Schumtech before you talk the before pre podcast.
02:08:02.40 --> 02:08:03.40 Pre podcast.
02:08:03.40 --> 02:08:05.40 I was on Schumtech.
02:08:05.40 --> 02:08:06.40 I was on Alpha Brain.
02:08:06.40 --> 02:08:09.40 Schumtech.
02:08:09.40 --> 02:08:13.40 I got my shipment of Alpha Brain pills.
02:08:13.40 --> 02:08:15.40 But back in, I had run out.
02:08:15.40 --> 02:08:17.40 And I was only had the instant.
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:21.40 And so now like I said, what's nice about the pills is you got something.
02:08:21.40 --> 02:08:23.40 You got something coming to come to do the podcast.
02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:24.40 Guess what?
02:08:24.40 --> 02:08:25.40 Alpha Brain pills.
02:08:25.40 --> 02:08:29.40 And I might double up on the Alpha Brain if I think I got to really get my
02:08:29.40 --> 02:08:30.40 Gary.
02:08:30.40 --> 02:08:33.40 But it's good to have the the capsules.
02:08:33.40 --> 02:08:34.40 Yeah.
02:08:34.40 --> 02:08:35.40 As well.
02:08:35.40 --> 02:08:36.40 I dig in.
02:08:36.40 --> 02:08:38.40 But what's cool about the drink is it tastes good.
02:08:38.40 --> 02:08:42.40 And I, if you get the sweet tooth itch going and you want something sweet.
02:08:42.40 --> 02:08:43.40 And you get the peach.
02:08:43.40 --> 02:08:44.40 Yeah.
02:08:44.40 --> 02:08:46.40 The natural peach, not the spicy.
02:08:46.40 --> 02:08:48.40 The spicy has a different situation going on.
02:08:48.40 --> 02:08:50.40 The peach is just straight up like tasty.
02:08:50.40 --> 02:08:51.40 Like peach.
02:08:51.40 --> 02:08:52.40 Yeah.
02:08:52.40 --> 02:08:53.40 Peach.
02:08:53.40 --> 02:08:54.40 Peach.
02:08:54.40 --> 02:08:55.40 Yeah.
02:08:55.40 --> 02:08:56.40 Kind of like that.
02:08:56.40 --> 02:08:58.40 I dig it the pills.
02:08:58.40 --> 02:08:59.40 I dig it.
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:01.40 And that's actually what we had.
02:09:01.40 --> 02:09:02.40 Was the pills.
02:09:02.40 --> 02:09:05.40 I said, we, because me and my brother were.
02:09:05.40 --> 02:09:06.40 Alpha Brain.
02:09:06.40 --> 02:09:08.40 But when they came out with the instant that was better.
02:09:08.40 --> 02:09:10.40 And it starts to become like this little kind of ritual.
02:09:10.40 --> 02:09:12.40 You know, you mix up your Alpha Brain.
02:09:12.40 --> 02:09:13.40 You know, kind of thing.
02:09:13.40 --> 02:09:14.40 And it's instant.
02:09:14.40 --> 02:09:15.40 I don't know.
02:09:15.40 --> 02:09:17.40 Just seems like either way it doesn't matter.
02:09:17.40 --> 02:09:19.40 If I haven't mentioned it already, I think I did.
02:09:19.40 --> 02:09:22.40 These are supplements from on it on it.
02:09:22.40 --> 02:09:23.40 On it.com.
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:25.40 We talked about the supplements.
02:09:25.40 --> 02:09:27.40 But there's like workout side.
02:09:27.40 --> 02:09:28.40 I just bought a jump rope.
02:09:28.40 --> 02:09:29.40 Did you?
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:30.40 Yeah.
02:09:30.40 --> 02:09:31.40 See.
02:09:31.40 --> 02:09:34.40 So when I was young, I was good at jumping rope too.
02:09:34.40 --> 02:09:35.40 Yeah.
02:09:35.40 --> 02:09:40.40 And then as I, you know, as I think kind of when, when, I don't
02:09:40.40 --> 02:09:42.40 maybe early 20s kind of stopped.
02:09:42.40 --> 02:09:43.40 So that's long time ago.
02:09:43.40 --> 02:09:45.40 Jump rope is awesome.
02:09:45.40 --> 02:09:46.40 Yeah.
02:09:46.40 --> 02:09:48.40 So as in, you know, you know, how like writing a bike.
02:09:48.40 --> 02:09:50.40 You can stay good at something a little bit.
02:09:50.40 --> 02:09:51.40 You're rusty.
02:09:51.40 --> 02:09:52.40 You're rusty.
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:52.40 Yeah.
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:53.40 Definitely give me rusty.
02:09:53.40 --> 02:09:54.40 You can't shred.
02:09:54.40 --> 02:09:55.40 And can't go as long.
02:09:55.40 --> 02:09:56.40 You know, like that could stuff.
02:09:56.40 --> 02:09:58.40 It's weird because it, you know how jump rope is.
02:09:58.40 --> 02:10:00.40 You know what's your weirdest back in the day of boxing?
02:10:00.40 --> 02:10:01.40 And no.
02:10:01.40 --> 02:10:02.40 Yeah.
02:10:02.40 --> 02:10:04.40 Boxing jumping rope for three minutes was like no factor.
02:10:04.40 --> 02:10:05.40 Yeah.
02:10:05.40 --> 02:10:06.40 Go jump.
02:10:06.40 --> 02:10:07.40 Yeah.
02:10:07.40 --> 02:10:08.40 Go get your jump rope right out.
02:10:08.40 --> 02:10:09.40 Get out.
02:10:09.40 --> 02:10:10.40 Get out.
02:10:10.40 --> 02:10:11.40 Three minutes on the ground.
02:10:11.40 --> 02:10:12.40 You feel it.
02:10:12.40 --> 02:10:13.40 Yeah.
02:10:13.40 --> 02:10:14.40 So yeah.
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:15.40 About one of those.
02:10:15.40 --> 02:10:17.40 And it's so the interesting thing about that is.
02:10:17.40 --> 02:10:20.40 Jump rope technology has changed a little bit.
02:10:20.40 --> 02:10:21.40 So what does it made of steel?
02:10:21.40 --> 02:10:22.40 No.
02:10:22.40 --> 02:10:24.40 Well, there's, I'm sure there's steel in there.
02:10:24.40 --> 02:10:26.40 So but it's like each handle has a swivel.
02:10:26.40 --> 02:10:27.40 The little, I mean it's simple.
02:10:27.40 --> 02:10:30.40 But there's like way more to it than before last time.
02:10:30.40 --> 02:10:32.40 It was like two wooden handles and a rope.
02:10:32.40 --> 02:10:33.40 Yeah.
02:10:33.40 --> 02:10:34.40 Yeah.
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:34.40 For sure.
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:35.40 Actual rope.
02:10:35.40 --> 02:10:37.40 This one is like a cord that survives all this stuff.
02:10:37.40 --> 02:10:38.40 I don't know.
02:10:38.40 --> 02:10:39.40 Anyway, got a jump rope.
02:10:39.40 --> 02:10:41.40 The jump rope is on there if you want.
02:10:41.40 --> 02:10:43.40 Well, we'll have a jump off.
02:10:43.40 --> 02:10:44.40 Yeah.
02:10:44.40 --> 02:10:45.40 I was pretty good too.
02:10:45.40 --> 02:10:47.40 You had to put your nerve through.
02:10:47.40 --> 02:10:53.40 You remember when you jump rope and then when the, you know how like, and this was like elementary school.
02:10:53.40 --> 02:10:59.40 And if you get tired or you couldn't keep a rhythm, they'd say, hey, just just wave it from the front.
02:10:59.40 --> 02:11:01.40 You know, that's an angel move.
02:11:01.40 --> 02:11:02.40 Yeah.
02:11:02.40 --> 02:11:06.40 What's it called when you to turn to taro, to taro when you boom.
02:11:06.40 --> 02:11:07.40 Like I like,
02:11:09.40 --> 02:11:10.40 Matador.
02:11:10.40 --> 02:11:13.40 Is it called Matador when you just go side to side?
02:11:13.40 --> 02:11:16.40 Yeah.
02:11:16.40 --> 02:11:18.40 You can't get it or whatever.
02:11:18.40 --> 02:11:19.40 Yeah.
02:11:19.40 --> 02:11:20.40 I just get that rhythm going.
02:11:20.40 --> 02:11:21.40 Oh, yeah.
02:11:21.40 --> 02:11:22.40 I don't know the name.
02:11:22.40 --> 02:11:23.40 I never had to do that because I was expert level.
02:11:23.40 --> 02:11:28.40 Even in elementary school, but that's going to be you if, in fact, you want to step up.
02:11:28.40 --> 02:11:30.40 So you can get that on on it, not just.
02:11:30.40 --> 02:11:33.40 If you want, if you want, kettle bells on there too.
02:11:33.40 --> 02:11:34.40 The good kind.
02:11:34.40 --> 02:11:36.40 Well, kettle bells are good straight out.
02:11:36.40 --> 02:11:37.40 They're all good.
02:11:37.40 --> 02:11:40.40 And, but it has those artistic ones.
02:11:40.40 --> 02:11:41.40 Yeah.
02:11:41.40 --> 02:11:43.40 The competition ones are very cool hands.
02:11:43.40 --> 02:11:44.40 Yeah.
02:11:44.40 --> 02:11:45.40 Oh, yeah.
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:48.40 So yeah, you get the legend bells, which is like what?

02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:56.40 You know, primal bells, which is like all that, you know, primates and stuff.
02:11:56.40 --> 02:11:57.40 Yeah.

02:12:03.40 --> 02:12:05.40 I have zombie bells.
02:12:05.40 --> 02:12:06.40 Mine are just eagles on base.
02:12:06.40 --> 02:12:07.40 How big is this on?
02:12:07.40 --> 02:12:08.40 Don't want you out.
02:12:08.40 --> 02:12:09.40 I forgot I got a lock.
02:12:09.40 --> 02:12:10.40 Yeah.
02:12:10.40 --> 02:12:11.40 So it's like designer.
02:12:11.40 --> 02:12:13.40 You can you probably keep it inside too.
02:12:13.40 --> 02:12:14.40 Yeah.
02:12:14.40 --> 02:12:15.40 No, that's that's it.
02:12:15.40 --> 02:12:16.40 You really do.
02:12:16.40 --> 02:12:21.40 No, the one that I keep inside is not the ones in my garage are for the long heavy work.
02:12:21.40 --> 02:12:24.40 This one is for, oh, I'm tired of writing right now.
02:12:24.40 --> 02:12:26.40 I'm going to bang out some snatches.
02:12:26.40 --> 02:12:27.40 Right.
02:12:27.40 --> 02:12:28.40 Boom.
02:12:28.40 --> 02:12:29.40 Boom.
02:12:29.40 --> 02:12:30.40 God.

02:12:31.40 --> 02:12:32.40 Yeah.
02:12:32.40 --> 02:12:33.40 Right.
02:12:33.40 --> 02:12:34.40 Yeah.
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:34.40 There you go.
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:35.40 But yeah, this is anyway.
02:12:35.40 --> 02:12:39.40 The point there is there's very cool things on the website on it.com.
02:12:39.40 --> 02:12:42.40 And the supplements, it's not to mention this.
02:12:42.40 --> 02:12:47.40 The fact is the supplements are straight up the best ones straight up.
02:12:47.40 --> 02:12:50.40 Because from the beginning and how is this?
02:12:50.40 --> 02:12:54.40 And I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
02:12:54.40 --> 02:12:55.40 I do.
02:12:55.40 --> 02:12:55.40 I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
02:12:55.40 --> 02:12:56.40 I do.
02:12:56.40 --> 02:12:58.40 I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.
02:12:58.40 --> 02:12:59.40 I do.
02:12:59.40 --> 02:13:02.40 I listen to Joel Rogan all the time and he says these things.
02:13:02.40 --> 02:13:04.40 And I believe him.
02:13:04.40 --> 02:13:06.40 If you get like, I don't know.
02:13:06.40 --> 02:13:07.40 Shroom tech.
02:13:07.40 --> 02:13:08.40 Yeah.
02:13:08.40 --> 02:13:09.40 I don't even feel it.
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:10.40 I got tapped out.
02:13:10.40 --> 02:13:12.40 So, you know, I expect more out of Shroom tech.
02:13:12.40 --> 02:13:14.40 I expect this to make me tap out everybody.
02:13:14.40 --> 02:13:15.40 I don't like it.
02:13:15.40 --> 02:13:16.40 Send it back.
02:13:16.40 --> 02:13:18.40 No, you don't even send it back.
02:13:18.40 --> 02:13:19.40 You send them an email.
02:13:19.40 --> 02:13:20.40 Saying hey, I don't like this.
02:13:20.40 --> 02:13:21.40 I'll just send you money back.
02:13:21.40 --> 02:13:22.40 You don't have to send it back.
02:13:22.40 --> 02:13:24.40 That's pretty awesome then.
02:13:24.40 --> 02:13:25.40 Yep.
02:13:25.40 --> 02:13:28.40 But don't be trying to be like, you're going to give me my money back.
02:13:28.40 --> 02:13:31.40 And the next month after you're done with it, order some more.
02:13:31.40 --> 02:13:32.40 And then do it again.
02:13:32.40 --> 02:13:33.40 Don't do it again.
02:13:33.40 --> 02:13:34.40 Yeah.
02:13:34.40 --> 02:13:36.40 You're going to get ostracized nonetheless.
02:13:36.40 --> 02:13:37.40 Crill oil.
02:13:37.40 --> 02:13:39.40 That's the one you don't want to not have crill oil.
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:44.40 Even if you're like a young guy in my opinion, which I should always been on crill oil.
02:13:44.40 --> 02:13:45.40 Yeah.
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:49.40 And if you're not on crill oil, I think you are like a step behind joint wise.
02:13:49.40 --> 02:13:52.40 Which puts you behind a lot of different ways.
02:13:52.40 --> 02:13:53.40 A lot of different ways.
02:13:53.40 --> 02:13:54.40 Yeah, you didn't work and out as hard.
02:13:54.40 --> 02:13:56.40 And I was working on this hard.
02:13:56.40 --> 02:13:59.40 A struggling through various activities in everyday life.
02:13:59.40 --> 02:14:02.40 I told this story whatever, but I do it all the time.
02:14:02.40 --> 02:14:05.40 You know, when you fill up water in the big five gallon jugs.
02:14:05.40 --> 02:14:08.40 And you know, and Brad, do that at night when it's kind of cold.
02:14:08.40 --> 02:14:11.40 It's like, break your carry those things from the thing to your car.
02:14:11.40 --> 02:14:15.40 You don't want to be worried about my knees or whatever.
02:14:15.40 --> 02:14:16.40 You're back.
02:14:16.40 --> 02:14:17.40 The trials.
02:14:17.40 --> 02:14:18.40 You shouldn't be like that.
02:14:18.40 --> 02:14:19.40 And you've got to put it in there.
02:14:19.40 --> 02:14:22.40 You think I should write your own book, dude?
02:14:22.40 --> 02:14:26.40 What about like the kind of crazy trials you've been through, carrying water?
02:14:26.40 --> 02:14:29.40 I'll look cool night in Southern California.
02:14:29.40 --> 02:14:30.40 I know.
02:14:30.40 --> 02:14:35.40 You know, very fresh and pure water, by the way.
02:14:35.40 --> 02:14:36.40 Doesn't make it lighter though.
02:14:36.40 --> 02:14:37.40 You still have to struggle.
02:14:37.40 --> 02:14:39.40 But here's the thing, though.
02:14:39.40 --> 02:14:42.40 There are micro, they're called micro struggles.
02:14:42.40 --> 02:14:43.40 It's really what they are.
02:14:43.40 --> 02:14:45.40 You know, standing in line.
02:14:45.40 --> 02:14:47.40 Actually, in the same kind of thing, that's not a struggle.
02:14:47.40 --> 02:14:48.40 That's manufactured struggle.
02:14:48.40 --> 02:14:52.40 So it's like an exercise in discipline and embracing struggle.
02:14:52.40 --> 02:14:53.40 That's what it is.
02:14:53.40 --> 02:14:57.40 It's not an actual struggle bestowed upon your heap on your shoulders.
02:14:57.40 --> 02:14:59.40 You know, they have to bear in everyday life.
02:14:59.40 --> 02:15:01.40 That's not what's the standing in line.
02:15:01.40 --> 02:15:04.40 That's why if you need your book about echoes struggles.
02:15:04.40 --> 02:15:07.40 You can document these various.
02:15:07.40 --> 02:15:10.40 Me looking for a specific wine.
02:15:10.40 --> 02:15:11.40 That's why.
02:15:11.40 --> 02:15:12.40 Was there a tomato one?
02:15:12.40 --> 02:15:13.40 Two likes.
02:15:13.40 --> 02:15:14.40 We're going to tomato sauce.
02:15:14.40 --> 02:15:15.40 I went.
02:15:15.40 --> 02:15:16.40 Yes.
02:15:16.40 --> 02:15:18.40 Yeah, it's a tomato struggle.
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:19.40 The wine struggle.
02:15:19.40 --> 02:15:20.40 The groceries now.
02:15:20.40 --> 02:15:21.40 We got the fill in the water bottles.
02:15:21.40 --> 02:15:22.40 There's four chapters.
02:15:22.40 --> 02:15:23.40 My micro struggles.
02:15:23.40 --> 02:15:23.40 Yeah.
02:15:23.40 --> 02:15:26.40 And filling up the water is not a struggle because I'm on the
02:15:26.40 --> 02:15:29.40 real oil. Oh, Omega 3 is fighting to my joint.
02:15:29.40 --> 02:15:30.40 Straight into my joints.
02:15:30.40 --> 02:15:31.40 Uptake.
02:15:31.40 --> 02:15:33.40 High percentage uptake.
02:15:33.40 --> 02:15:36.40 Anyway, get on the cruel oil.
02:15:36.40 --> 02:15:37.40 I'm on the strong bone now, too.
02:15:37.40 --> 02:15:41.40 By the way, for that's for tendons.
02:15:41.40 --> 02:15:44.40 The tendon attaching to the bone.
02:15:44.40 --> 02:15:46.40 Strong TM does it.
02:15:46.40 --> 02:15:47.40 It does it about it.
02:15:47.40 --> 02:15:49.40 I feel really good about it actually.
02:15:49.40 --> 02:15:52.40 More preventative because I lift.
02:15:52.40 --> 02:15:53.40 Yeah.
02:15:53.40 --> 02:15:54.40 Nonetheless,
02:15:54.40 --> 02:15:56.40 Strong TM that's in strong bone.
02:15:56.40 --> 02:15:57.40 That get doesn't.
02:15:57.40 --> 02:16:00.40 That doesn't hit the like the limelight isn't on that all the time.
02:16:00.40 --> 02:16:01.40 It's all on calcium most of the time.
02:16:01.40 --> 02:16:02.40 I'm like calcium.
02:16:02.40 --> 02:16:03.40 It makes your bone strong.
02:16:03.40 --> 02:16:05.40 Strong TM just as much.
02:16:05.40 --> 02:16:08.40 So get on the strong bone.
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:10.40 A bone strength.
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:12.40 Also.
02:16:12.40 --> 02:16:13.40 Offer brain.

02:16:21.40 --> 02:16:22.40 Not butter.
02:16:22.40 --> 02:16:23.40 It's not peanut butter.
02:16:23.40 --> 02:16:26.40 It's like almond cashew and walnut.
02:16:26.40 --> 02:16:27.40 Don't know.

02:16:40.40 --> 02:16:41.40 I wouldn't recommend it.
02:16:41.40 --> 02:16:45.40 I don't even know if anyone would recommend that.

02:17:08.40 --> 02:17:11.40 That Jocqu's covered.
02:17:11.40 --> 02:17:13.40 Everyone's a well-jocqua-covered article.
02:17:13.40 --> 02:17:15.40 The links may be all do that.
02:17:15.40 --> 02:17:17.40 But nonetheless, the books are all on there.

02:17:40.40 --> 02:17:41.40 That sounds like a good plan.
02:17:41.40 --> 02:17:44.40 Even if you buy and don't take.
02:17:44.40 --> 02:17:48.40 Also, do you have a link to your favorite duct tape on there?
02:17:48.40 --> 02:17:49.40 No.
02:17:49.40 --> 02:17:53.40 Sometimes I say things that are just so inherently brilliant.
02:17:53.40 --> 02:17:54.40 And that's what we wonder.
02:17:54.40 --> 02:17:58.40 So we will have a duct tape link.
02:17:58.40 --> 02:17:59.40 Link for sure.
02:17:59.40 --> 02:18:02.40 Yeah, just in case everyone needs duct tape.
02:18:02.40 --> 02:18:05.40 And they especially need it when they get the most of the podcasts
02:18:05.40 --> 02:18:08.40 or they're thinking about the things that they're going to be duct-caping together.
02:18:08.40 --> 02:18:09.40 Yeah.
02:18:09.40 --> 02:18:10.40 Yeah, that's true.
02:18:10.40 --> 02:18:12.40 You know why I mentioned duct tape in the beginning?
02:18:12.40 --> 02:18:15.40 And I didn't really realize this because I didn't think about it
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:18.40 until the handful of people asked me.
02:18:18.40 --> 02:18:19.40 You know why?
02:18:19.40 --> 02:18:21.40 Because he's watching the guy relevant time.
02:18:21.40 --> 02:18:22.40 Actually, I still watch my guy right now.
02:18:22.40 --> 02:18:24.40 That's a strange thing.
02:18:24.40 --> 02:18:25.40 No, no, no.
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:27.40 It's on the channel called Clue.
02:18:27.40 --> 02:18:30.40 CLO, oh, random channel.
02:18:30.40 --> 02:18:31.40 Yeah.
02:18:31.40 --> 02:18:33.40 It's like a retro channel kind of.
02:18:33.40 --> 02:18:34.40 Okay.
02:18:34.40 --> 02:18:35.40 Okay, for a man.
02:18:35.40 --> 02:18:36.40 No, it says that.
02:18:36.40 --> 02:18:38.40 Well, there's a new guy right by the way.
02:18:38.40 --> 02:18:39.40 A new one.
02:18:39.40 --> 02:18:39.40 Which lame?
02:18:39.40 --> 02:18:41.40 I don't think it says good as a old one, but it could be just my,
02:18:41.40 --> 02:18:44.40 you know how you get attached to your old shows.
02:18:44.40 --> 02:18:45.40 It could be that.
02:18:45.40 --> 02:18:47.40 But my guy, we was dope back in the day.
02:18:47.40 --> 02:18:48.40 So, you know, whichever.
02:18:48.40 --> 02:18:49.40 And that was this thing.
02:18:49.40 --> 02:18:50.40 Duck tape.
02:18:50.40 --> 02:18:52.40 People like to say, well, paper clip, right?
02:18:52.40 --> 02:18:55.40 My guy over with the paper, he, I never really had a paper clip.
02:18:55.40 --> 02:18:56.40 Really?
02:18:56.40 --> 02:18:57.40 He had duct tape.
02:18:57.40 --> 02:18:58.40 That was his thing.
02:18:58.40 --> 02:18:59.40 I know, sorry.
02:18:59.40 --> 02:19:00.40 I watched TV.
02:19:00.40 --> 02:19:01.40 All right, way.
02:19:01.40 --> 02:19:02.40 That's on you.
02:19:02.40 --> 02:19:03.40 And I dig it.
02:19:03.40 --> 02:19:04.40 But I was busy getting back after.
02:19:04.40 --> 02:19:05.40 He had the switch.
02:19:05.40 --> 02:19:06.40 Sorry, man.
02:19:06.40 --> 02:19:07.40 And the duct tape.
02:19:07.40 --> 02:19:08.40 That was his thing.
02:19:08.40 --> 02:19:10.40 Everything else he just found in his environment is environment, which
02:19:10.40 --> 02:19:12.40 changed from episode to episode.

02:19:27.40 --> 02:19:29.40 Why did I do that today?
02:19:29.40 --> 02:19:33.40 There's some reason I had to go to a different platform.
02:19:33.40 --> 02:19:36.40 So, I have a backup platform.
02:19:36.40 --> 02:19:37.40 Boom, subscribe to both.

02:19:39.40 --> 02:19:41.40 Is that kind of like YouTube and Vimeo?
02:19:41.40 --> 02:19:43.40 You know, some guys who have a Vimeo account as well.
02:19:43.40 --> 02:19:45.40 I don't know why that got escalated.
02:19:45.40 --> 02:19:46.40 It's good.
02:19:46.40 --> 02:19:47.40 YouTube.
02:19:47.40 --> 02:19:48.40 Bad video.
02:19:48.40 --> 02:19:49.40 I'll tell you what.
02:19:49.40 --> 02:19:52.40 I don't know why, but this could be the reason why because YouTube.
02:19:52.40 --> 02:19:53.40 Okay.
02:19:53.40 --> 02:19:58.40 Vimeo is kind of for like professional people who fancy themselves as like film makers.
02:19:58.40 --> 02:19:59.40 Right.
02:19:59.40 --> 02:20:01.40 This is my piece that I've made in artists.
02:20:01.40 --> 02:20:02.40 It tends to be that.
02:20:02.40 --> 02:20:03.40 Right.
02:20:03.40 --> 02:20:06.40 YouTube is just like, guys, you just kind of have to.
02:20:06.40 --> 02:20:07.40 But overall, yeah, exactly right.
02:20:07.40 --> 02:20:08.40 Just throw my video.
02:20:08.40 --> 02:20:11.40 YouTube, like, you know, the tube, TV, to you.
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:13.40 Whatever you are.
02:20:13.40 --> 02:20:14.40 Vimeo is, I don't know, the name.
02:20:14.40 --> 02:20:15.40 I guess I can think about it.
02:20:15.40 --> 02:20:19.40 But nonetheless, that's what it shook itself out to beat.
02:20:19.40 --> 02:20:22.40 You know, so it's funny when people are like, I'm not on YouTube.
02:20:22.40 --> 02:20:23.40 I'm on Vimeo.
02:20:23.40 --> 02:20:24.40 I'm on my wrist.
02:20:24.40 --> 02:20:25.40 Yeah.
02:20:25.40 --> 02:20:29.40 Do you have to do anything to be on Vimeo or you're just still something to do?
02:20:29.40 --> 02:20:30.40 No.
02:20:30.40 --> 02:20:31.40 Same exact thing.
02:20:31.40 --> 02:20:35.40 It's exactly like YouTube except for the fact, which now that I'm thinking about it makes sense,
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:40.40 where if you upload a video and you're like, oh man, in one of these titles midway through the video,
02:20:40.40 --> 02:20:41.40 I spelt it wrong.
02:20:41.40 --> 02:20:43.40 Which happens to me sometimes.
02:20:43.40 --> 02:20:48.40 You can go back into your account and replace the video, even if it's been up for a week.
02:20:48.40 --> 02:20:49.40 You can just replace or you too.
02:20:49.40 --> 02:20:51.40 Vimeo, YouTube, you cannot.
02:20:51.40 --> 02:20:52.40 Yes, a new video.
02:20:52.40 --> 02:20:53.40 Yeah.
02:20:53.40 --> 02:20:54.40 So you got to upload again.
02:20:54.40 --> 02:20:55.40 And here's the thing.
02:20:55.40 --> 02:20:57.40 You can't upload the same file.
02:20:57.40 --> 02:20:58.40 Got to rename it.
02:20:58.40 --> 02:21:00.40 Because YouTube, no, you got to re-eat it.
02:21:00.40 --> 02:21:02.40 It has all these little information in the file.
02:21:02.40 --> 02:21:04.40 They'll be like, hey, that's a duplicate file.
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:05.40 You can't do that.
02:21:05.40 --> 02:21:08.40 You know, probably had something to do with advertising.
02:21:08.40 --> 02:21:09.40 I don't know.
02:21:09.40 --> 02:21:12.40 Nonetheless, subscribe to Jockel Podcast on YouTube.
02:21:12.40 --> 02:21:17.40 If you like that channel, we're trying to provide what you call providing value.
02:21:17.40 --> 02:21:19.40 You know, that's, don't say that.
02:21:19.40 --> 02:21:23.40 But that's another, it sounded cool when I first heard it.
02:21:23.40 --> 02:21:28.40 But it's another, that's another, it's a new, like,
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:31.40 that's another one of those things where it sounded cool.
02:21:31.40 --> 02:21:35.40 And then everyone thought like me or I think like everyone else, whatever.
02:21:35.40 --> 02:21:37.40 And so everyone started using it now.
02:21:37.40 --> 02:21:38.40 It's like people are abusing it.
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:40.40 And maybe here, just trying to provide value.
02:21:40.40 --> 02:21:43.40 It just starts to sound like that.
02:21:43.40 --> 02:21:45.40 You know, good voice, you just have to think, you know, we don't do voices.
02:21:45.40 --> 02:21:48.40 Other than exclamation.
02:21:48.40 --> 02:21:50.40 Thanks, Jockel.
02:21:50.40 --> 02:21:52.40 Anyway, subscribe to YouTube.
02:21:52.40 --> 02:21:58.40 We're trying to provide some value there with the excerpts and various other clips.
02:21:58.40 --> 02:22:03.40 Aside from the video version of this podcast, you're Memorial Day 1.
02:22:03.40 --> 02:22:04.40 It was really good.
02:22:04.40 --> 02:22:05.40 I liked it.
02:22:05.40 --> 02:22:07.40 It was a powerful, powerful letter.
02:22:07.40 --> 02:22:12.40 Yeah.
02:22:12.40 --> 02:22:13.40 Bunch of other stuff.
02:22:13.40 --> 02:22:17.40 Um, like.
02:22:17.40 --> 02:22:19.40 Jockel has a store.
02:22:19.40 --> 02:22:21.40 It's called Jockel Store.
02:22:21.40 --> 02:22:22.40 If you didn't know already, no.
02:22:22.40 --> 02:22:23.40 Jockelstore.com.
02:22:23.40 --> 02:22:24.40 What do we have in Jockel Store?
02:22:24.40 --> 02:22:26.40 We have T-shirts.
02:22:26.40 --> 02:22:28.40 If you were to show it to Jockel, also as a podcast.
02:22:28.40 --> 02:22:29.40 Sure.
02:22:29.40 --> 02:22:30.40 Jockel.
02:22:30.40 --> 02:22:31.40 Jockel has white tea.
02:22:31.40 --> 02:22:32.40 It's called Jockel White Tea.
02:22:32.40 --> 02:22:34.40 Yeah, I think I see a trend here.
02:22:34.40 --> 02:22:35.40 Yeah.
02:22:35.40 --> 02:22:36.40 Yeah, the trend is real.
02:22:36.40 --> 02:22:37.40 Yeah, sure.
02:22:37.40 --> 02:22:39.40 Um, nonetheless, the shit.
02:22:39.40 --> 02:22:40.40 A virginality and name.
02:22:40.40 --> 02:22:42.40 Well, no.
02:22:42.40 --> 02:22:43.40 Yeah.
02:22:43.40 --> 02:22:46.40 So in a way, because here, there are layers in that too.
02:22:46.40 --> 02:22:49.40 And there is sophistication to that even though it seems simple.
02:22:49.40 --> 02:22:50.40 Oh, because.
02:22:50.40 --> 02:22:52.40 There I was being sophisticated.
02:22:52.40 --> 02:22:53.40 You are being something out of it.
02:22:53.40 --> 02:22:55.40 Because there's more to Jockel than just, oh, yeah.
02:22:55.40 --> 02:22:57.40 That just happens to be my name.
02:22:57.40 --> 02:22:58.40 There's two.
02:22:58.40 --> 02:23:00.40 There's more to that goes beyond this podcast beyond the TV.
02:23:00.40 --> 02:23:01.40 Whatever.
02:23:01.40 --> 02:23:02.40 Right.
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:03.40 Okay.
02:23:03.40 --> 02:23:05.40 So just let's just start with that fact, which is complex in and of itself.
02:23:05.40 --> 02:23:07.40 Then you're like, okay.
02:23:07.40 --> 02:23:12.40 Look, this is what roughly considered a company.
02:23:12.40 --> 02:23:13.40 Technically.
02:23:13.40 --> 02:23:14.40 Maybe.
02:23:14.40 --> 02:23:15.40 I guess if you had to.
02:23:15.40 --> 02:23:16.40 If you had to.
02:23:16.40 --> 02:23:17.40 Okay.
02:23:17.40 --> 02:23:17.40 That's me.
02:23:17.40 --> 02:23:18.40 Okay.
02:23:18.40 --> 02:23:19.40 What do I do?
02:23:19.40 --> 02:23:20.40 Like for a living.
02:23:20.40 --> 02:23:24.40 And I was like, I was like, oh, just like stuff.
02:23:24.40 --> 02:23:25.40 Yeah.
02:23:25.40 --> 02:23:26.40 And he goes, well, what would you?
02:23:26.40 --> 02:23:27.40 How would you, what he said?
02:23:27.40 --> 02:23:32.40 He said, well, how would you describe what you do?
02:23:32.40 --> 02:23:35.40 And I said, stay busy.
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:36.40 That's what I do.
02:23:36.40 --> 02:23:37.40 Yeah.
02:23:37.40 --> 02:23:38.40 Okay.
02:23:38.40 --> 02:23:39.40 Fair enough.
02:23:39.40 --> 02:23:40.40 Yeah.
02:23:40.40 --> 02:23:42.40 There you go.
02:23:42.40 --> 02:23:44.40 But technically, because bar is.
02:23:44.40 --> 02:23:46.40 I've never heard that one in a while.
02:23:46.40 --> 02:23:48.40 Good.
02:23:48.40 --> 02:23:50.40 Jockelpot.cast.com.
02:23:50.40 --> 02:23:51.40 That's an entity.
02:23:51.40 --> 02:23:52.40 I don't know.
02:23:52.40 --> 02:23:53.40 Company business.
02:23:53.40 --> 02:23:56.40 It's a place where we have the web.
02:23:56.40 --> 02:23:57.40 It's not.
02:23:57.40 --> 02:23:58.40 Nonetheless, oh, you know what?
02:23:58.40 --> 02:24:01.40 I'm going to go ahead and out on a limb and call it a brand.
02:24:01.40 --> 02:24:02.40 It's brand-dish.
02:24:02.40 --> 02:24:03.40 Whatever.
02:24:03.40 --> 02:24:08.40 Nonetheless, if you call, okay, well, Jockel store, that's the name of the store.
02:24:08.40 --> 02:24:09.40 Yeah.
02:24:09.40 --> 02:24:10.40 Well, that's true.
02:24:10.40 --> 02:24:14.40 So, and to be honest with you, the reason that I called the podcast, Jockelpotcast,
02:24:14.40 --> 02:24:17.40 when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast, I said, Jockel Hungry.
02:24:17.40 --> 02:24:18.40 I don't even know.
02:24:18.40 --> 02:24:21.40 I don't know if I just said, I don't know if it's on the podcast or not.
02:24:21.40 --> 02:24:24.40 But he, I think he says, oh, you know, we got to go to get some food.
02:24:24.40 --> 02:24:25.40 And I was like, Jockel Hungry.
02:24:25.40 --> 02:24:27.40 And then I was like, well, we're going to do a podcast record.
02:24:27.40 --> 02:24:28.40 Jockelpotcast.
02:24:28.40 --> 02:24:30.40 But that was the initial thought.
02:24:30.40 --> 02:24:31.40 There's the layer.
02:24:31.40 --> 02:24:32.40 Makes sense.
02:24:32.40 --> 02:24:33.40 Yeah.
02:24:33.40 --> 02:24:34.40 And that's it.
02:24:34.40 --> 02:24:39.40 But even with naming the other words, I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted to do
02:24:39.40 --> 02:24:41.40 and not care.
02:24:41.40 --> 02:24:42.40 Yeah.
02:24:42.40 --> 02:24:43.40 And that makes sense.
02:24:43.40 --> 02:24:48.40 I knew we were going to talk about Jockelpot and fighting in music and in hardcore and war and death.
02:24:48.40 --> 02:24:52.40 And I just wanted to not have any limitations.
02:24:52.40 --> 02:24:57.40 And the only way I could do that, because if you can give the podcast a name like, you know,
02:24:57.40 --> 02:25:00.40 the, the, the, the, this podcast.
02:25:00.40 --> 02:25:01.40 Yeah.
02:25:01.40 --> 02:25:07.40 It's like, okay, well, then what I'm next to you know, we're talking about war and or if you call it the war podcast,
02:25:07.40 --> 02:25:11.40 but you're talking about business or if you don't talk about the leadership podcast, but you're talking about
02:25:11.40 --> 02:25:12.40 Jiu-Jitsu.
02:25:12.40 --> 02:25:14.40 So how do you get all those things into one thing?
02:25:14.40 --> 02:25:16.40 Call the Jockelpotcast and I can do whatever I want.
02:25:16.40 --> 02:25:17.40 Yeah.
02:25:17.40 --> 02:25:18.40 There you go.
02:25:18.40 --> 02:25:22.40 And if people are looking for you, they see you talk about XYZ or like, you know, I sure I can look up.
02:25:22.40 --> 02:25:23.40 XYZ.
02:25:23.40 --> 02:25:24.40 Easy connection.
02:25:24.40 --> 02:25:25.40 Yeah.
02:25:25.40 --> 02:25:26.40 And it's simple.
02:25:26.40 --> 02:25:27.40 You know, simply goes along with.
02:25:27.40 --> 02:25:29.40 Yeah, you know, and that's kind of like a thing.
02:25:29.40 --> 02:25:30.40 So why are we talking about this?
02:25:30.40 --> 02:25:32.40 I'm just saying that's what it's called Jockelpotto.
02:25:32.40 --> 02:25:33.40 Oh, yeah, that's right.
02:25:33.40 --> 02:25:34.40 So because it is a story.
02:25:34.40 --> 02:25:36.40 You know, people want to do other things in their life.
02:25:36.40 --> 02:25:38.40 Besides, listen to our ancestors.
02:25:38.40 --> 02:25:39.40 Well, you're the one chiming in.
02:25:39.40 --> 02:25:41.40 And over here, don't talk about that.
02:25:41.40 --> 02:25:46.40 I should've noticed that the other day when we had Roger Hayden on, and I gave you the silent treatment.
02:25:46.40 --> 02:25:50.40 And when you looked at me for affirmation while you were giving the advertising,
02:25:50.40 --> 02:25:51.40 I didn't even nod.
02:25:51.40 --> 02:25:55.40 I just looked at you and you got, you actually got uncomfortable.
02:25:55.40 --> 02:25:57.40 Yeah, you actually got uncomfortable.
02:25:57.40 --> 02:25:59.40 You were like, maybe you look on your face.
02:25:59.40 --> 02:26:02.40 Like, well, you look at me like I was going to give you a smile.
02:26:02.40 --> 02:26:04.40 I know, I just look at you like hurry up.
02:26:04.40 --> 02:26:06.40 And then you got uncomfortable.
02:26:06.40 --> 02:26:08.40 And I said, well, he's starting to feel it.
02:26:08.40 --> 02:26:09.40 Yeah, if you know, it works.
02:26:09.40 --> 02:26:11.40 Yeah, that's like subtle.
02:26:11.40 --> 02:26:12.40 Sure.
02:26:12.40 --> 02:26:13.40 You know, man.
02:26:13.40 --> 02:26:14.40 It's all good.
02:26:14.40 --> 02:26:16.40 You know, so do that again right now.
02:26:16.40 --> 02:26:18.40 You know, so I can talk about the story.
02:26:18.40 --> 02:26:19.40 Jockels story.
02:26:19.40 --> 02:26:20.40 Jockels story.com.
02:26:20.40 --> 02:26:21.40 If you like t-shirts.
02:26:21.40 --> 02:26:24.40 No, I'm not saying if you like t-shirts in general.
02:26:24.40 --> 02:26:28.40 I'm just saying, if you want to represent this clinical freedom,
02:26:28.40 --> 02:26:29.40 what get after it.
02:26:29.40 --> 02:26:32.40 No, the darkness.
02:26:32.40 --> 02:26:33.40 No, the darkness.
02:26:33.40 --> 02:26:35.40 That's a good one.
02:26:35.40 --> 02:26:38.40 You know, anyway, go on the search.
02:26:38.40 --> 02:26:39.40 Jockels story.com.

02:26:43.40 --> 02:26:44.40 That's a good one.
02:26:44.40 --> 02:26:45.40 I've got some rash cards on there.
02:26:45.40 --> 02:26:48.40 One new rash card out already says get after it on it.
02:26:48.40 --> 02:26:50.40 Discipline on one sleeve.
02:26:50.40 --> 02:26:51.40 Freedom on the other sleeve.
02:26:51.40 --> 02:26:52.40 Jockel approved.
02:26:52.40 --> 02:26:53.40 Really good.
02:26:53.40 --> 02:26:55.40 I think it's good.
02:26:55.40 --> 02:27:00.40 I feel that the people who have witnessed it.
02:27:00.40 --> 02:27:02.40 Is that pompous to say, witness it?
02:27:02.40 --> 02:27:05.40 Like do some kind of a little bit of a lot.
02:27:05.40 --> 02:27:06.40 Yeah, maybe you know a lot.
02:27:06.40 --> 02:27:09.40 Anyone that's witnessed my rash card.
02:27:09.40 --> 02:27:10.40 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:27:10.40 --> 02:27:13.40 That I bestowed upon them by way of visual.
02:27:13.40 --> 02:27:16.40 How about people that thought it was a little pretty cool.
02:27:16.40 --> 02:27:17.40 That was cool.
02:27:17.40 --> 02:27:18.40 That was really cool.
02:27:18.40 --> 02:27:19.40 That was cool.
02:27:19.40 --> 02:27:20.40 And so there it is.
02:27:20.40 --> 02:27:21.40 You go on the story.
02:27:21.40 --> 02:27:22.40 Look at him.
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:28.40 If you think it's cool, you're going to want to witness the glory of echo Charles's rash cards.
02:27:28.40 --> 02:27:33.40 You may go to jockelstore.com and revel in the glory.
02:27:35.40 --> 02:27:37.40 Exactly right.
02:27:37.40 --> 02:27:39.40 And whatever else you want, this is good stuff on there.
02:27:39.40 --> 02:27:41.40 We added this little thing to if we're out.
02:27:41.40 --> 02:27:44.40 And I'm sure they'd like, I'm kind of treestock, you know, re-stock.
02:27:44.40 --> 02:27:45.40 Boom.
02:27:45.40 --> 02:27:51.40 But I added this little thing where if like let's say the size medium or whatever is out,
02:27:51.40 --> 02:27:53.40 it just says, oh, a little button.
02:27:53.40 --> 02:27:54.40 Notify me.
02:27:54.40 --> 02:27:55.40 But your email boom.
02:27:55.40 --> 02:27:56.40 Notify as you when it's back in stock.
02:27:56.40 --> 02:27:59.40 And again, I'm trying to put them back in stock.
02:27:59.40 --> 02:28:00.40 Ace app.
02:28:00.40 --> 02:28:01.40 Boom.
02:28:01.40 --> 02:28:03.40 But, you know, give me a day or two or whatever.
02:28:03.40 --> 02:28:05.40 I'll notify you.
02:28:05.40 --> 02:28:06.40 Boom.
02:28:06.40 --> 02:28:10.40 Also psychological warfare.
02:28:10.40 --> 02:28:14.40 If you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks.
02:28:14.40 --> 02:28:15.40 Come on.
02:28:15.40 --> 02:28:17.40 Not music tracks.
02:28:17.40 --> 02:28:19.40 Word tracks.
02:28:19.40 --> 02:28:22.40 It's like spoken word.
02:28:22.40 --> 02:28:25.40 You know, so basically what it's for is, you know, it's not like poetry.
02:28:25.40 --> 02:28:28.40 Well, arguably not poetry, but Stockholm.
02:28:28.40 --> 02:28:29.40 They're talking.
02:28:29.40 --> 02:28:31.40 Talking to us to me.
02:28:31.40 --> 02:28:33.40 Joc was talking to me.
02:28:33.40 --> 02:28:36.40 That actually quite literally was talking to you when that was made.
02:28:36.40 --> 02:28:37.40 Exactly right.
02:28:37.40 --> 02:28:39.40 So, you know, you can have me talk to you.
02:28:39.40 --> 02:28:42.40 So basically what it's for is he's not just talking.
02:28:42.40 --> 02:28:43.40 Every day stuff.
02:28:43.40 --> 02:28:47.40 So when you have hard time waking up in the morning or you have hard time because you're tired
02:28:47.40 --> 02:28:51.40 and you want to skip the workout or you have hard time because, you know, it's lunchtime
02:28:51.40 --> 02:28:55.40 and I'm all hungry and all they have is donuts here or whatever.
02:28:55.40 --> 02:28:56.40 What else is there?
02:28:56.40 --> 02:28:58.40 What if you're procrastinating?
02:28:58.40 --> 02:29:01.40 Also, if you're procrastinating or what do you call it?
02:29:01.40 --> 02:29:02.40 What if you're procrastinating?
02:29:02.40 --> 02:29:03.40 What if you're procrastinating?
02:29:03.40 --> 02:29:04.40 The podcast.
02:29:04.40 --> 02:29:07.40 Maybe you could listen to that one right now.
02:29:07.40 --> 02:29:08.40 We did.
02:29:08.40 --> 02:29:10.40 I'm trying to explain this thoroughly.
02:29:10.40 --> 02:29:14.40 So we can all have a really good understanding of what it is.
02:29:14.40 --> 02:29:15.40 And it's value.
02:29:15.40 --> 02:29:17.40 It's down over the moment.
02:29:17.40 --> 02:29:21.40 Me talking about moments of weakness so you can get through them.
02:29:21.40 --> 02:29:22.40 Yeah.
02:29:22.40 --> 02:29:24.40 Next comment.
02:29:24.40 --> 02:29:25.40 Yeah.
02:29:25.40 --> 02:29:26.40 I guess.
02:29:26.40 --> 02:29:28.40 Let me add this one more thing.
02:29:28.40 --> 02:29:29.40 Oh.
02:29:29.40 --> 02:29:33.40 Actually, you can even take it at moments of triumph and strength.
02:29:33.40 --> 02:29:35.40 And it will still work.
02:29:35.40 --> 02:29:37.40 You'll just want to do it more.
02:29:37.40 --> 02:29:38.40 You know?
02:29:38.40 --> 02:29:39.40 Yeah.
02:29:39.40 --> 02:29:41.40 It's like drinking coffee when you're not tired.
02:29:41.40 --> 02:29:42.40 You know what I mean?
02:29:42.40 --> 02:29:43.40 Yeah.
02:29:43.40 --> 02:29:44.40 Double down.
02:29:44.40 --> 02:29:45.40 That's sink in.
02:29:45.40 --> 02:29:46.40 It's like a lot of work.
02:29:46.40 --> 02:29:47.40 It's like a lot of work.
02:29:47.40 --> 02:29:48.40 Fair on iTunes.
02:29:48.40 --> 02:29:49.40 Amazon music.
02:29:49.40 --> 02:29:50.40 All these music.
02:29:50.40 --> 02:29:51.40 Google play.
02:29:51.40 --> 02:29:52.40 Google play.
02:29:52.40 --> 02:29:53.40 I think it's on everything.
02:29:53.40 --> 02:29:54.40 Cool.
02:29:54.40 --> 02:29:55.40 But yeah, man.
02:29:55.40 --> 02:29:56.40 Do it.
02:29:56.40 --> 02:29:57.40 Right on.
02:29:57.40 --> 02:29:58.40 All right.
02:29:58.40 --> 02:29:59.40 Also, you can get jacquo white tea on Amazon.
02:29:59.40 --> 02:30:07.40 And when you order jacquo white tea, make sure you also order more weights for your barbells.
02:30:07.40 --> 02:30:11.40 Because your deadlift is going to go up to approximately 8,000 pounds.
02:30:11.40 --> 02:30:14.40 So you need to get that much weights when you order it.
02:30:14.40 --> 02:30:16.40 Way the warrior kid.
02:30:16.40 --> 02:30:17.40 Book.
02:30:17.40 --> 02:30:20.40 It's been out for a couple weeks now.
02:30:20.40 --> 02:30:23.40 And thank you for getting it.
02:30:23.40 --> 02:30:30.40 Also, a little warning that someone put on Amazon in their review.
02:30:30.40 --> 02:30:33.40 I thought it was worth hearing and thinking about parents.
02:30:33.40 --> 02:30:34.40 Be ready.
02:30:34.40 --> 02:30:37.40 I bought this book after listening to jacquo on the Joe Rogan podcast where jacquo was the guest.
02:30:37.40 --> 02:30:40.40 Great podcast bought the book after learning jacquo has a book for kids.
02:30:40.40 --> 02:30:45.40 My son who isn't very motivated yet was excited about the book.
02:30:45.40 --> 02:30:48.40 When he started reading the book, a fire lit underneath him.
02:30:48.40 --> 02:30:51.40 He said to me, dad, I'm going to get up tomorrow at 5 a.m.
02:30:51.40 --> 02:30:53.40 Will you get up with me?
02:30:53.40 --> 02:30:57.40 And that moment I realized that I was going what was going on.
02:30:57.40 --> 02:30:59.40 And I couldn't let him down.
02:30:59.40 --> 02:31:02.40 I enjoy my sleep like everyone else.
02:31:02.40 --> 02:31:05.40 But I was amazed that my son got excited to order a pie.
02:31:05.40 --> 02:31:06.40 Yes, let's do it.
02:31:06.40 --> 02:31:07.40 Got up at 5 a.m.
02:31:07.40 --> 02:31:11.40 And there's a alarm clock must not have gone off, but I turned on his light and his bedroom.
02:31:11.40 --> 02:31:12.40 And he got right up.
02:31:12.40 --> 02:31:15.40 He got his clothes and shoes on and we went for a jog.
02:31:15.40 --> 02:31:17.40 We've never done this before.
02:31:17.40 --> 02:31:21.40 I had him do some sit ups and pushups after and he gladly did.
02:31:21.40 --> 02:31:23.40 Couldn't quite do pushups if that's okay.
02:31:23.40 --> 02:31:25.40 We'll get there.
02:31:25.40 --> 02:31:26.40 Long story short.
02:31:26.40 --> 02:31:28.40 This book only being a few chapters.
02:31:28.40 --> 02:31:29.40 And he only a few chapters in.
02:31:29.40 --> 02:31:30.40 That was kind of surprise.
02:31:30.40 --> 02:31:31.40 I saw that.
02:31:31.40 --> 02:31:32.40 Only a few chapters in.
02:31:32.40 --> 02:31:34.40 Made the book worth getting.
02:31:34.40 --> 02:31:39.40 In this day and age of electronics and iPads and tablets kids don't seem to be as motivated
02:31:39.40 --> 02:31:41.40 to do activities as when I was a kid.
02:31:41.40 --> 02:31:42.40 I'm 39.
02:31:42.40 --> 02:31:47.40 So I edified him after for making the decision to get up at 5 a.m.
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:48.40 on a non school day.
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:52.40 And I told him that he can apply that mentality to anything in life.
02:31:52.40 --> 02:31:53.40 Boom.
02:31:53.40 --> 02:31:54.40 Way the warrior kid.
02:31:54.40 --> 02:31:55.40 Get it for your kid.
