00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 232, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Good evening. From Colonel Grosby, commanding fifth manchester regimen, dear madam,

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you're a letter of the 20th of August reached me safely. Your per person died a heroic soldiers death

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and all belonging to the fifth manchester regimen from myself downwards are proud of having been comrades

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of so brave and honorable, a lad. I'm glad to be able to inform you he did not suffer

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and he great pain. He died saying he hoped if he ever got over his wounds he would soon be able to return to his duty.

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm informed by those who were present with him in the blockhouse at the time that he passed away happily

8
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and willing to meet his God. You have every reason to be proud of his memory

9
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and may God help and comfort you in your great sorrow.

10
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I will inquire if he has left any keep say that could be either sent to or kept for you.

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I've asked my wife to call and see you the next time she is in Manchester.

12
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Believe me, yours faithfully, H. Grosby, Colonel.

13
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that right there is a letter of condolence, written back to a grieving mother in England during the second

14
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Boer War in Africa, South Africa.

15
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And of course the letter is painted the picture of a, well let's just say a kind of perfect heroic death,

16
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which I guess is what any mother would want to hear.

17
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But make no mistake about any war, including the Boer War in South Africa, that this scene was awful.

18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So the Boer War in South Africa, you know, it's a war that people consider to be one of the first modern wars.

19
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There's a bunch of wars you could throw in there.

20
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That are also called that.

21
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I mean the Americans of the War was in some ways considered a modern war.

22
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You know, you had some wars that were right around there that weren't a modern war.

23
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They were kind of a mixing.

24
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There's one battle that the British fought against the modest Sudanese.

25
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It was in 1898 to September of 1898.

26
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And during this battle, you know, it was British soldiers and actually Egyptian soldiers as well,

27
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
versus these these Sudanese.

28
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And during the battle, there was 48 of the British and Egyptians who were killed, 382 wounded.

29
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And on the Sudanese side, there was 12,000 dead and 13,000 wounded.

30
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So that was kind of a lopsided battle.

31
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And if you stand up against the British and try and fight them in that manner of, hey, we'll go toe to toe.

32
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We have machine guns or we don't have machine guns, but we have.

33
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We have repeating rifles.

34
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We have a massive advantage over you and you're going to continue to charge it us.

35
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We're going to mow you down and that's what happened there.

36
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So what happens in the second brewer war is an early example of asymmetric war fair meaning.

37
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You have a small group in this case, the Boers, which is a Afra cons term that means farmers.

38
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And there's between 20 and 60,000 of them and they're going up against the British Empire,

39
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which at the time was a massive powerhouse obviously, they end up with 500,000 troops.

40
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So 350,000 brets, 150,000 colonials and 100,000 Africans that are fighting on the British side.

41
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The second brewer war, the first one took place in 1880, but it was much, much smaller.

42
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They started with a farmer that refused to pay taxes.

43
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You know, that seems to be a common thread.

44
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We don't like to pay taxes.

45
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And the government confiscated his farm and his equipment and they were going to have an auction.

46
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And then these other farmers got together and they attacked the auction.

47
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And this is the original term, the term commando, which we usually use it to talk about an individual person.

48
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But the original term meant a group of people.

49
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It was called a commando meant, you know, whatever, 30, 40, 100 guys band together, kind of like a militia group.

50
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the way, and they kind of acted in the way we think commando's act, which means they, you know, they would use mobility and speed and violence of action, surprise and set of ambushes and those kind of behaviors.

51
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And meanwhile, the brets are still in that, in that first brewer war, the brets are still wearing red uniforms.

52
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And the students saying this is a, this is a, this is a strange world. This is as, you know, this is during the evolution of war.

53
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And they're still firing, you know, they're still setting up in lines and firing valleys together as a group and on command, you know, ready to fire that type of thing.

54
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And meanwhile, the, the brewer commando's are hiding behind trees and the first battle that they have, there's 120 brets dead or wounded.

55
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And there's two brewers dead and five wounded. So, you know, this, this war lasted 10 weeks, the first one. And like I said, it was less of a war, you know, light action.

56
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And eventually, they kind of go into this uneasy piece. And then the second brewer war comes along and, and you know, I'm just trying to give some high level.

57
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The second brewer war is a fight between it's, it's these allies, these, these new brewer allies, there's, there's two new states that are formed. One of them is called, I think it's officially called the South African Republic, but I usually see it referred to as Transval.

58
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And the other, there's another state or country called the Orange Free State. And so here's the basis of these, these are a little bit for, you know, the shape of Africa, you get the bottom of Africa, where South Africa is today, you, you go inland a little bit. And what happened was

59
00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the first brewers were brewers. And so, they were brewers. But they were brewers, but they were brewers at one point. They stopped slavery, like no more slavery. And the boars, they still wanted slavery. Because they were farmers and they, well, that, that was part of their economy, and well, they just thought that they deserved to have slaves.

60
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And so, they were more, there was no kind of deal set up for them to be compensated to say, look, if you want us to change the way we're running this economy, we need to, you know, we need money, you know, we need money to hire people.

61
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So they looked for some kind of compensation, the brewers were like, no, this is an immoral activity, and we're not having slavery anymore, it's all, it's over. So the boars, or large portion of boars, which again, not now, these are, these are different groups of people.

62
00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I want to say, mainly Dutch, the boars were mainly Dutch settlers, which is why they speak African, which is like a version of Dutch. So they, about 15,000 of them leave and they march north. And so now they set up these two states where slavery still allowed.

63
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And they, and they kind of exist for a while, you know, in a relatively, I guess, in a relatively peaceful way, at least in terms with the British. Well, guess what they find in this land that they end up settling in, they find gold, they find diamonds.

64
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And this starts to, well, now you, now you gold diamonds more, that's where it leaves to.

65
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The, there's kind of three phases that this war goes through. In the first one, the brewers are unprepared. They're not ready for this.

66
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:54.000
In the second phase, the brewers bring in massive numbers of people and supplies, and they kind of just war of attrition over power, the boars.

67
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And then the boars go into like full guerilla warfare mode, insurgency mode. And then the breats go hardcore scorched earth. We're going to win war of attrition.

68
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And the first ever concentration camps, I'm pretty sure that the term concentration camps comes from this war, because what the British ended up doing is saying, okay, we don't want to, we don't want to harm the women and children. So they took the, the boor women and children and put them in these camps, while the camps were a total disaster and 25 plus thousand women and children died of starvation and disease in those camps.

69
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And eventually just through just harsh brutality, the, the boor's were broken and they surrendered in 1902.

70
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:12.000
But from a perspective, from just a strategic perspective, if you think about this, it took three long bloody and expensive years for the mighty British Empire.

71
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:36.000
To defeat these kind of ad hoc commando units from the boor side. And that's what they actually were. They would, they would assemble, you know, hey, all of us are going to get together. They would kind of elect who's going to run it and then they would decide what they were going to do sort of by consensus. That's what these original commando units were.

72
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Winston Churchill, he worked as a reporter during this war and he was captured, I think he was captured on a train.

73
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
He was put into a prisoner of war camp. He escaped. I mean, that's kind of one of his, that's one of the things that made Winston Churchill Winston Churchill.

74
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And that's also where he got this name commando that they started using a World War II. I'm pretty sure he derived the name commando like for the British commando's because their activities, their, their methodology is we're going to be based on what the, what the South African boor's did, what the South African commando units did.

75
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And he applied that name to the kind of the early special operation. It's types troops in World War II. And there's another thing that I think about when I, when I think about the boors and the, I think this kind of captures

76
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:50.000
certainly an attitude that is prevalent in special operations forces and really in the military. And it's a, it's a saying, it's kind of wrapped up in a saying that the, that the South African boors had and the, the,

77
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the saying is, and I'm not going to do this right because you know, it's a foreign language, but the, the saying is on boor mackon plan. And, and what it means is a boor makes a plan. And it's a pretty cool saying because what do you do and something goes wrong. What do you, you know, what's, what's our, what are we going to do when something goes wrong, you know, it's a boor is going to make a plan. We're going to figure it out. We're going to, we're going to do something about it. We're not going to sit back and just let things unfold.

78
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
That was their attitude that's still their attitude and, and of course looks out for Africa's been a place of a lot of turmoil apartheid.

79
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:39.000
It's, it's been, you know, financially just a disaster at some point. It's it's just a tough place. And I've been there. I've actually been lucky enough to have been down there.

80
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's an awesome country. It's an epic country. The, the nature there is just unbelievable shout out to the troopers down there in South Africa, Paul Slade, his, his South African crew, his company, they have, they have legit,

81
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:11.000
do you, you, you shout out to fit fight fit Malaysia down there. And you know, that was interesting. Awesome guys, awesome gym, a guy named chef.

82
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And chef, who's who's legit and, and his buddy Rich, they, they run this gym down there and we went there and trained when I was in South Africa. I had like a,

83
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:40.000
it seemed like about a 14 hour death roll with chef who's a total beast. Penny Thomas also from South Africa, Penny Thomas, the chef to to Penny Thomas, but incredible place, incredible place.

84
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And you know, that gym was amazing. What they were doing in that gym and one, one thing that kind of surprised me is it was totally wide open, like every different type of person was in there.

85
00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Rich kids, poor kids, black kids, white kids just wide open. There's incredible atmosphere and everybody freaking for you. And so if you ever are in South Africa, go check that place out. It's awesome.

86
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:33.000
But, you know, ever since I went down there and even before that, I mean, it's just a war, you know, if you know the root word of the word, command, you always think about what this was all about. And so, there's, you know, I'm always looking for lessons learned, there's a book called the Boor War and military reforms, and it's written by a guy named Jay Stone and another guy named Erwin Schmidl.

87
00:15:33.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And it's an a very interesting book the way it analyzes what happened and what lessons were learned. And I'm going to focus on the lessons learned that they pulled from it. And I'm sure at some point, there's I've got a, I've got quite a few good books of, you know, the normal jockel podcast first person account of a guy that was on the battlefield, which looks some of these battles were just insane, especially because you get to see the, well, will will will will just, will just jump into it.

88
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So a couple of things to kick this thing off. Here we go, go into the book.

89
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Britain was unique among European great powers in retaining a voluntary army. So this time, a lot of Europe had conscripts still. So you're just, you're just going to do your service, you're going to draft it.

90
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
In order maintain a flow of recruits equipment had to be of above average quality, making the British army the most expensive in the world, per soldier. So there's spend a lot of money.

91
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000
With government preoccupied by the budget, there was little room for innovation, much of the 19th century, not a lot of, not a lot of innovation happening.

92
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:52.000
One of the things that they talk about is of all the specialized departments. It was intelligence, where the dual British deficiencies of organization and budgetary restrictions are best illustrated.

93
00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:02.000
In 1899, the German spent an equivalent of $270,000 for an intelligent staff of 300 officers, Great Britain, only spent 11,000.

94
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So they're not spending much on intel, and where this comes to play as perhaps the war's most glaring intelligence failure was the lack of adequate maps of South Africa and in particular of the Bur reports.

95
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000
The Bur's for their part published no maps and would allow no British subject into their countries to draw them. So they'd go to knew what was going on.

96
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:33.000
It's also interesting because for them to make that, for them to proactively do that, they knew the importance of maps.

97
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And a lot of people don't understand the importance of terrain when it comes to combat. If you don't understand the terrain, you're in trouble.

98
00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Here's a little cut of what the officers were like, identified non-professional, polo playing officer corps, recruited from a narrow social base, resulted from a system which was itself dependent on private funding for an officer's expenses. The army was suited to recreational life.

99
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:19.000
In the 1890s an officer could absent himself from regimental duties for as much as 250 days annually. In the name of sport.

100
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I mean, I'm going to tell you right now, you get 30 days leave in the US military. These guys are getting 250 days.

101
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Even when on duty recreation was facilitated by making an officer's time his own after the completion of regular duties usually about 930 a.m.

102
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:53.000
While the ideal of sport may have been carried to an extreme, it perhaps helped develop the trade most often associated with British officers. They're conspicuous courage. That virtue was to be indispensable for the attainment of rank.

103
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And the large numbers of Victoria Cross is one by senior officers attest to this fact. The officers' com courage tended to radiate throughout the ranks.

104
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So this idea of these just totally brave British officers that are sort of, well, that's what they count on. They count on hey, we're brave. That's how we're going to win.

105
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.000
But continue on courage alone, however, did not produce a good officers for professional education and attitude were often lacking.

106
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Few officers were acquainted with foreign languages and the writing of technical military studies was found upon.

107
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Think about that.

108
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
You're a professor that's going to lead the military and it's frowned upon to write about military subjects.

109
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The only proof of this is the fact that in 1900 Germany produced 50% of the world's military literature, France 25% and Great Britain 1%

110
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:01.000
If the raw material of trade of the officer corps was somewhat lacking only owing to portraying this system served only to compound its errors. So you can see what you're dealing with.

111
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Doesn't this paint the most stereotypical picture of these officer guys that are like, hey, I'm smart, I'm a great athlete, you know, you know, why don't you just study this stuff on brave.

112
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And you also think about Germany, look, Germany has a

113
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:34.000
A militaristic nature, right, and obviously even more so before World War II and before World War I even more so think about one country's producing 50% of the world's military literature.

114
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
That's insane.

115
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And the brits are producing less than one percent.

116
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000
A couple other things here about what we're dealing with long term 12 year enlistments created a professional rank and file in order to attract manpower Britain had to pay in both relative and absolute terms.

117
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000
During prosperous times, pay had to go up or the army it was feared would be left with only the drugs of society.

118
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
To deal with this perceived problem, the English army had always maintained a high proportion of officers and NCOs.

119
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Supervision was omnipresent and individuality was systematically stamped out of the recruit, so it's a super top heavy organization.

120
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And all there like everything's just being oversupervised and you're always being told what to do.

121
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:35.000
It's always amazing the you know in the army or the Marine Corps, there'll be a guy that's 20 years old and he'll be in charge of like a legit number of guys.

122
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Then and where is this is the opposite? This is where hey, I've been in the army for nine years and I'm not in charge of anyone because I'm getting directed on how to do everything.

123
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
The natural outgrowth of such closely ordered system was a soldier bred to difference and lacking in initiative.

124
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
You can see where this is going.

125
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:03.000
How much of this was due to process and how much was due to raw material is open to question 18.99 only 18% of the enlisted men could be considered illiterate.

126
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
So got a bunch of guys that can't even read.

127
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Reserve components got to talk about this just to let you know that they're out.

128
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000
The reserve components known as militia reserves, militia volunteers or young and re had several distinct roles and they played the national defense system.

129
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So they're going to get called up as well kind of the reservists.

130
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
The army was totally directed toward home and colonial defense.

131
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
In examining battlefield effectiveness, one must go beyond questions of organization and numbers to matters of tactical doctrine.

132
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
For the British, this was most often equated with overwhelming firepower.

133
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
That's what their their doctrine is working over well with firepower.

134
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Every soldier received an issue of 200 rounds annually for target practice. That's a joke.

135
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
All training and practice fire was carried out from kneeling and standing positions.

136
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
I'm going to promise you, you don't want to be standing on the battlefield.

137
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Muscatry practiced and this is a quote consisted of firing limited number of rounds at stationary bullseye targets.

138
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:17.000
At fixed known ranges progressing from 100 to 1000 yards, the distances gradually increasing instead of decreasing as they normally do in war.

139
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Once a year there was a field firing when the batai would spend a glorious morning,

140
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:30.000
lacing away at the number of screens set up in conspicuous positions, which in no sane enemy would ever think of occupying.

141
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000
So that's what they're doing. They're lining up 150 rounds where to be used solely for practicing collective fire.

142
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So out of your 200 rounds, 150 of them are going to be, hey, we're all standing up and lying and we're practicing shooting together.

143
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
On the battlefield regulation stated that infantry fire was to be open at 450 meters as opposed to 600 to 1000 meters for the Germans.

144
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
While the British continued to place undue emphasis upon volley fire, the Germans preferred individual skirmish fire.

145
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Large sections of training manuals dealt with close order battalion formations, such as the square or echelon which deemed especially useful in savage warfare.

146
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
So what they're talking about there is the Zulu wars, like hey, you're getting attacked, we're going to stay in line.

147
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And as these people attack us with spears, we're going to gun them down.

148
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And it's important that we stay tight and put up big valleys of fire.

149
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Meanwhile, the Germans are over there going, hey, skirmish line, you know, cover and move, make a little bound forward.

150
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Sir Frederick Marys the famed military historian of the period lent his prestige to a volume that taught the advance is to be made

151
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
as rapidly as possible, the main object being the attack with the bayonet.

152
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Independent firing is generally advisable only at short range, but so did you hear that?

153
00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Individual firing is only advisable at short range, but if an especially favorable target presents itself, it may be ordered also at the middle of extreme ranges.

154
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Whilst the attack is being developed, follow these only are to be fired by a section or subsections till the order is given for independent firing.

155
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
That's what they're doing.

156
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:21.000
More sophisticated solutions involving fire and movement, cover and move, could not be developed as long as heavy reliance was placed upon the bayonet.

157
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Which in turn was the most, which in turn was most effective in massed formations and proved a psychological weapon par excellence, faith in the bayonet enabled troops to advance with the intent to use it.

158
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
It was feared that if this principle is ever called into question, then the troops would not approach the enemy close enough to be of any use whatsoever.

159
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:55.000
So they are, they're using the bayonet charge as sort of the foundational culmination of their movement.

160
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
These guys have guns.

161
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You know, the enemy is gonna have guns.

162
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Tactical flexibility was extremely limited since the drillbook of 1896 did not include any instructions for the movement of troops in extended order.

163
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Exended order means you're spread apart. They're all that close to order. They're all basically shoulder to shoulder.

164
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Oral commands tended to be extremely formal to the point of awkwardness. For instance, one said that blank face, the blank being filled by some objects such as a building rather than right face, similarly one had to say advance right incline hole rather than take cover behind those rocks.

165
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:49.000
The British tactical scheme supposed that once units were engaged, they would function mechanically.

166
00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:00.000
They would not consider that morale might falter under adversity. Think about that. They just think when they give the order to go.

167
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Guys are gonna go. morale will not falter.

168
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:14.000
During the years immediately preceding the Burr war, the army had two opportunities to test the effectiveness of its organization in doctrine, 1898 British Britain stage.

169
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:25.000
They're just peacetime maneuvers in more than a generation. Some 50,000 men organized in two corps and two cavalry brigades took part over a period of three months.

170
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
The maneuvers in fact went on only from breakfast to dinner.

171
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000
As officers felt the need to be freeing the evenings to attend to the London Theatre and socialize with the country gentry. It's horrible.

172
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
This exercise was held on familiar grounds of aldershot, which was unfortunate, that's encouraged in a collective reconnaissance.

173
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
So you already know, so we're not gonna do any reconnaissance. We already walk around here all the time.

174
00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Perhaps the greatest revolution in the ineptness of the high command and dealing with more troops than most of its members had ever seen one place.

175
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Their flaws noted in the officer's failure to mount secondary attacks and a continued lack of coordination with artillery.

176
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
When forced to dismount cavalry showed considerable firepower in the defensive supported by machine guns on offense, however,

177
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
that still proved inadequate in reconnaissance. The second phase which took place at aldershot was even less successful than the first.

178
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Infintery advanced without the use of cover.

179
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:40.000
This is a nightmare. Reconnaissance was poor. No digging in of trenches was permitted, allegedly for fear of damaging the downs, the fields at their own.

180
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:55.000
General sir Butler, not having commanded troops for 12 years, ended maneuvers with a disastrous one to one assault after marching his command 14 miles.

181
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You can kind of see what we're dealing with. Are you getting a picture of what we're dealing with?

182
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
It's not a good picture. It's not a good picture. It's not a good picture. It's a peace time scenario.

183
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
And look, they were in wars during these timeframes. I mean, I talked about what they did. They were in wars.

184
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
This was England, man. They were all over the world, fight and skirmishes.

185
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:33.000
But they weren't getting in it in this kind of these tactics that they were using or working because they're going against people that aren't armed properly.

186
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So here we go. At the outbreak of hostilities, the Army could muster only 27,000.

187
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000
So now we're getting into this war. It could only muster 27,000 men in the field of operations, whereas the boars field fielded 45,000.

188
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Clearly, the situation differed from colonial wars in which the opponents lack the ability to monitor a gradual buildup pretty strength.

189
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Requesting troops and knowing what to do with them are two separate matters.

190
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Even after the outbreak of the war, no effort was made immediately to increase the intelligence staff or draw plans for troop utilization.

191
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
It was the Army after all that was responsible for the request that the colonials send only infantry and no cavalry.

192
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000
General Bullar and this is the guy initially kicking off the war. The feeder commander was to complain of the last minute plans.

193
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Here's what he had to say. The details were arranged by a committee sitting at the war office.

194
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
So we already don't like that. Like there's a war. You're in South Africa. There's people up in England. There's no internet.

195
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
There's no video teller conferencing. They're coming up with plans of how you're going to fight this thing. They're not even there.

196
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I was not invited to attend its meetings or a furnace with the minutes of its deliberations.

197
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I pressed for the employment of General French with the cavalry and for Colonel Miles on the staff. I had no voice in the appointment of the commanders or of the senior staff officers selected.

198
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
This is a good old boy network. This is guys going, oh, sounds like we've got a war in South Africa.

199
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I'd like to participate in that. Can you put me on? Put me on for a...

200
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:14.000
A jaunt down to the colonies to characterize British military establishment of 1899. Much should be made of its apathetic, snobbish and non-professional officer corps.

201
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
It's highly disciplined ranks and this is... You're going to hear this a lot.

202
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Let me say this also. I've worked with the brids before. They are outstanding. They are an outstanding military.

203
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And they obviously transformed from what we're talking about right now.

204
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
But... And that this is why. This is why.

205
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And I was going to say they used that we're disciplined.

206
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And many times when they used the word discipline, they use it both as a negative endopositive throughout this book.

207
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Because they... When they talk about the extreme discipline, it's like, hey, these guys weren't going to make decisions on their own.

208
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
They were just going to follow orders. So they used that term there. And they also talk about how it was a positive in some situations as well.

209
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Because they were disciplined soldiers that would make things happen.

210
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:18.000
So here we go. Like I said, apathetic, snobbish and non-professional officer corps, highly disciplined ranks and conservative anti-militaristic maloo in which it functioned.

211
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:28.000
How else to explain the Queen's regulations of 1899 which found space for 71 regulations dealing with dress.

212
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And only four for muscatry. And one for field training.

213
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
While still noting that the troops were old clothes to maneuver since the troops would not be anxious to buy new ones.

214
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
You see what we're dealing with?

215
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Yep.

216
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:55.000
And here we go. Despite these deficiencies, the world as a whole held the British Army in high regard in light of its long string of victories dating back to 1815.

217
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
You know, they beat Napoleon. They beat Napoleon, right? They beat the world champ.

218
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
You know? And so now they're the champ.

219
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
The British themselves believed that the Army was never in better condition either as regards to the zeal and skill of its officers from the highest to the lowest.

220
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The training and discipline of the men and the organizations of all branch to the service.

221
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
That's their attitude. Can we say arrogance and ego? Yes, we can.

222
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Thus, expiration of the brewer, ultimatum on October 11th, 1899,

223
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:39.000
regarding a cessation of all British military preparations held no major threat, despite the fact that the Army would be facing a relatively modern foe for the first time.

224
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
If men and material, obviously not reading the whole book, there's the caveat.

225
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
If men and material are proved to be in short supply in the early stages of the war, such as not the case with shipping.

226
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Britain has the premier maritime power and long been accustomed to the movement of troops by sea.

227
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:22.000
The massive commitment transported 188,000 men, 36,000 horses, 409 pieces of artillery, and 1,951 vehicles over 6,000 miles without any serious consequences on the level of British commerce.

228
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
That's amazing.

229
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So, logistically, they can get it on. The British Navy, the Royal Navy. Oh, you want us to deliver some goods?

230
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:42.000
We're going to deliver some goods. Supplemented by reserves, militia, young and revollentures, and eventually colonials the Army grew to four times its original size by the spring of 1900,

231
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000
the forces in the field actually outnumbered the combined population of transvol and of free-born state.

232
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Can you imagine you're going to war with more soldiers than they have people?

233
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.000
And it's still going to take you three years to get this thing sorted out. It's crazy.

234
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Manpower of any sort was increasingly welcome in the later stages of the conflict.

235
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Free use of the empires, entire manpower cannot be considered due to certain philosophical constraints,

236
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
which Captain A.E. Oppenheim voiced.

237
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
We must never, this is just such a, I just read this and I was like, wow.

238
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
This is not, this is very interesting. Here's what this guy says. This Captain.

239
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:49.000
We must never depart from the Cardinal Imperial Principle that the Imperial Army alone is privileged to meet any enemy at any time under any circumstance.

240
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:56.000
We must never resort to free use of native armies of the empire.

241
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:04.000
The white man, the ruling race, must bear the burden in the appeal to arms, must assert its superiority,

242
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:13.000
and must do it willingly and sack reficingly for their inlies the vital principle of empire.

243
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
The day that sees the white man shrinking from his responsibility, that sees him shifting the burden, burdened,

244
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:31.000
complacently from his own shoulders to those of his subject races, will also see the doom of his Imperial Dominion.

245
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Now that's something that I, that definitely was interesting to me because, you know, you think of these imperialists,

246
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000
you think of the British empire going in, well, we got a bunch of, whatever, we got a bunch of black guys down here in Africa, let's make them fight.

247
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And here is this attitude of, no, that's not right.

248
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
That's kind of crazy, right?

249
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:03.000
It's interesting for sure.

250
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Fast forward in a little bit. In retrospect, one cannot help a being pressed by the wars impact upon the army service corps,

251
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
increased the numbers, redesigned for a lighter and more durable enlarged system of animals.

252
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Furthermore, special bulk oriented, faster supply columns were developed for cavalry support.

253
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
For the first time limits instituted on officers' kits, this is why I lied to this port.

254
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:39.000
And the notorious cast iron kitchen and wagon load of champagne associated with general baller became a thing of the past.

255
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
This is like one of some of the things that they figured out during this war is that it's not smart to bring a cast iron kitchen and wagon loads of champagne.

256
00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I think it's safe to say to put this in a modern part of this is that this is the war where shit got real.

257
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I mean, think about the difference you're going to warn you're thinking, hey, let's make sure we got our champagne loaded up.

258
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Yeah, so what is it? I mean, where does that to come from just the sheer numbers and history and history man?

259
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:28.000
They've been running around kicking ass for, well, since they said they're 1815, you know, they were British were just kind of dominating.

260
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And we know what happens when you get that disease of victory.

261
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Yeah, champagne, oh, yeah, hey, I guarantee you.

262
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Some of these officers that they're talking about were thinking, oh, I'd like to go to South Africa. It's a little war going on. I'll go get my adventure done.

263
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Yeah, thank. And the thing is, here's the bottom line. I have this in the notes later, but.

264
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Imagine you're, you're used to boxing, right? And you're going to box someone and you grow in there and you've, you've trained a box, which means you're going to stand up and you're going to throw punches and you're not going to kick or elbow or do a take down or you're definitely not going to do anything like I gouge or, you know,

265
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000
maybe have something in your glove and shank someone, right? You're definitely not doing that stuff.

266
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:37.000
And by the way, so now you've been fighting under those rules for what is it? 85 years?

267
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So over 85 years, you've been fighting, and by the way, winning and winning because guess what?

268
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Everyone you're fighting, I mean, if we try to, if we try to figure out what this looked like, I bet you this looks like a 300 pound boxer that's going up against a 100 pound boxer.

269
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:01.000
That's kind of what all these wars have been like up to at this point, right? Hey, we're going to roll in there.

270
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And this person's going to be small and we can, we're going to do the boxing thing and they're going to throw, they're punches don't even hurt us.

271
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
And eventually you just knock this human out.

272
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And then one day, not only do you come up against someone that's going to do double leg take down the nose, chokes and arm locks, but that will also shank you.

273
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
You know, they don't have any rules, it's not just no rules MMA.

274
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:35.000
It's no rules, I'm going to, I'm going to have a shift and I'm going to cut your throat while, you know,

275
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000
ding, ding, round starts, you know, I come out with a K-bar and stick it into your spine. That's what we're talking about.

276
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Yeah. So why did they have this attitude? Because for all these years, they were the heavyweight champ and they, hey, I'm, I got a fight tonight. Cool.

277
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Make sure you bring the, you know, make sure you bring the shots for when we're done.

278
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Yeah, it's going to take about three minutes.

279
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And then I want, you know, I want to have about after party like the old UFC guys, I'm sure they're still good, but I haven't been in that part of your mouth.

280
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
But that's what it was. Yeah. Yeah, like it was so much like that that they would bring the champagne.

281
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:20.000
It's like they'd bring their trophy with them. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. This is disease of victory to the end degree.

282
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Yeah. It's crazy, man. It's crazy.

283
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:38.000
During the course of the bore war, the Afrocona armies, Afrocona armies numbered about 40,000 men, no more of 20,000 whom were ever on the field at one time.

284
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
So most people they ever had on the field was 20,000.

285
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
The question then is how could such a motley force of farmers defied the British Empire for so long?

286
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:58.000
One answer is as a French observer phrased it was simply the rifle, the rifle of small caliber, rapid firing, flat trajectory and smoke was powder.

287
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:07.000
And as another big advance you had guns that the gun, the gun powder didn't make smoke anymore, which meant you could shoot and you could hide.

288
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
And you could continue to attack and you wouldn't have the battlefield filled up with smoke.

289
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But then this is a little bit, it goes a little bit further than that.

290
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
The boars true strength was not at long ranges.

291
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Because they talk about how everyone thinks all the boars were hunters, they were farmers and they would really good shots at long ranges.

292
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:38.000
But this is kind of just, in addition to that, their true strength was not long ranges, but rather in sharp shooting at under 300 yards.

293
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Boars skill in that regard was demonstrated in the later stages of the war when their arms were mostly captured from the British and they still maintained their mastery and small unit fire fights.

294
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Rifles alone could not assure survival in the face of the vastly superior British numbers and cumulative power, firepower.

295
00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000
From the beginning even when they were overly attached to their wagons, the boars were able to outmarch their opponents.

296
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
When freed from their baggage, so they eventually they carried wagons in the beginning and then they finally were like, hey, we don't even bring in these things.

297
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
When freed of their baggage, train and camp followers, the difference in rate of movement increased rapidly.

298
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Boars mounted on ponies, could on occasion travel 60 miles a day for several days on end and when called upon,

299
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
there's sturdy little horses could go for three days without food.

300
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Such marches however could only be considered on the basis of a ready supply of remounts.

301
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
The additional factor was the Boars ponie lighter load weight and distribution. The Boars saddle weight half that of the British.

302
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
The rider carried only a little food, his rifle is ammunition and a blanket.

303
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Everything else was transported on a spare mount, consequently a Boar pony carried 250 pounds as compared to the British chargers nearly 400 pounds.

304
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
So the light weight.

305
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Light weight means going back to the heavy weight versus the 100 pound guy, the 100 pound guy's got some mobility.

306
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
And he's got some endurance.

307
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:11.000
They used their artillery very well talking about that a little bit concealment and protection where their cardinal principle.

308
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
This is for their artillery. They were for they were frequently outnumbered in the field.

309
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Several alternative protection protected positions were developed for each gun.

310
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Thus permitting rapid replacement when a piece came under fire.

311
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Speed of movement was the essence of the Boar Gunners and the British were constantly amazed by their ability to bring heavy ordinance rapidly into action at unexpected locations.

312
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
So they would pre-dig positions.

313
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000
So as soon as they started taking fire because eventually when you're shooting the enemies going to see where you're at or they're going to judge where you're at.

314
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
They're going to start shooting at you.

315
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
They would immediately move their gun into a pre-determined position.

316
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
The Boar's use of single guns rather than battery. They're talking about big artillery guns.

317
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Was the focused of considerable amount of contemporary interest.

318
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
A single piece could keep an entire army awake for a night firing at six miles range.

319
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
The Boar's realized the morale effect of unreturned fire.

320
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000
And the sense of security provided when one is assured of covering fire from one's own guns under any withdrawal.

321
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
They realized the psychological warfare just dropped in bombs from six miles away from one gun.

322
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And how powerful that was.

323
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:35.000
The machine gun proved more deadly and was considered an equivalent of 25 men.

324
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Thanks to the master masterly use of terrain and smokeless powder in battle the Boars were often able to give the impression of greater numbers than in fact existed.

325
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Captain Stlokum, the American observer, noted that at the battle of Kalesno and we're getting into that.

326
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Not a single Boar was to be seen from the beginning of the battle to the end.

327
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
On occasion, the Boars would deliberately expose themselves in order to further confuse the enemy.

328
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
So in this one of the opening battles.

329
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000
14,000 Brits versus 4,500 Boars. The Brits had 143 killed.

330
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:23.000
750,500. The Boars had eight killed. The 30 wounded.

331
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Use of dummy guns black powder to attract fire and command detonated diversionary charges further confuse the Brits.

332
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And the attacks had spying cop and Nicholson's neck. The Boars advanced in small mutually supporting groups rather than long lines.

333
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Generally they tried to deploy their younger men forward their old men to the rear and foreign volunteers to further back.

334
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000
So we have cover move going on. Totally different. Mutually supporting elements.

335
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.000
You know what the basis of maneuvering on the basis of fire move and cover move and fire maneuver is mutually supporting elements.

336
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:17.000
In fact, the minute that you get too far away from another element that you can't mutually support each other, you are going to die.

337
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Push in forward. By largely avoiding concentration and attack the Boars forfeited the initiative and allowed British time to deploy.

338
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
So this is something that the Boars didn't do well.

339
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
They didn't go on the attack. They didn't press the attack.

340
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.000
They didn't press the attack. So they did an advantage and they wouldn't take advantage of the advantage that they had.

341
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
When they could no longer extend their lines beyond the British, the British flank's conventional fighting ended.

342
00:47:48.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Inevitably the advance of the British and ceaseless Afrikaana retreat took their toll on the Boar morale with the fall of Komati Port and the war seemed over.

343
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Unable to contend fondly with massive British armies after the fall of Bloomfundheim, the Boars resorted increasingly to raids in order to forfeurses threatened communications and supply gain information, alarm the countryside, disrupt mobilization and concentrations.

344
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Devastate enemy, held lands and release prisoners. So that's the mode that they went into. That's straight up guerrilla warfare. For the Brits, war soon degenerated into a ceaseless pursuit of an elusive foe.

345
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
They were all too frequently caught on a wares by Boar, by Boar, commandos doubling back and attacking.

346
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Favorite Boar poise were setting grass fires to slow pursuit or riding parallel to supposed pursuers dismounting firing and falling back.

347
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Boar organization and war plans are also subjects of importance upon call.

348
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Every male citizen was responsible to present himself with ten days, rations, a horse, a rifle and 30 rounds of ammunition.

349
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:15.000
So this is how the Boars were set up. Men were organized into commandos based on electoral districts, although they were free to change units out.

350
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Well, this is told the Centralized Command. A commando would have anywhere from 300 to 3000 men.

351
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Command was vested in field cornet selected one port per ward since command was election most new actions were undertaken by consensus such a system could not long survive in warfare.

352
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
And we're going to, this is massive decentralized command. It's actually decentralized command to a to an extreme that becomes ineffective and oftentimes they end up not being able.

353
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:56.000
And the reason why they couldn't coordinate attacks work together, be like, okay, the enemies on the ropes, let's go coordinate and crush them. They wouldn't quite be able to pull that off.

354
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
You know, they would deal with consensus like, hey, I don't agree with that idea. We should wait a little longer than it's so they don't take action.

355
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:14.000
So there's that codomy of leadership decentralized command is great, but you can take it too far.

356
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:27.000
This is where I was talking about earlier. If the three capabilities of any army are its marching marksmanship and discipline, then is obvious where the booers fatal flaw lay in its lack of discipline.

357
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:43.000
For without discipline, there can be no coherent attack. The booers so valued their own lives and increased power of the defense that they tended to forsake the tactical offense. This lack of aggressiveness was evidenced in their proclivity for sieges.

358
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:52.000
I'm African, they outnumbered Baden pals force 10,000 men to 700 and that they didn't attack.

359
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
They had 10,000 against 700.

360
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Hey, we're just going to hold siege warfare. We're just going to sit here and wait, wait you out.

361
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
I mean, if I have 10,000 against 700, we're coming to get you.

362
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Such unwillingness to launch attacks consistently hurt the booer cause tactically and strategically, even in the field, the booers had the booers been more aggressive.

363
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
The British would not have had the time to maneuver around to their flank.

364
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Lack of discipline was not only a drawback to booer attacks, but also had peculiar ramifications for the process of surrender. White flags had never been used during the native wars and thus it was not understood that everyone must stop firing when the flags were raised by either side.

365
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
The British frequently complained that while some booers raised their hands, others would continue firing.

366
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
And that caused problems.

367
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Much to British, shagrin, Lord Roberts wrote, the booers have been the first to introduce into war the theory that every individual has the right to ask quarter for himself at any moment in an action.

368
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.000
A theory which our own soldiers seem to have almost invariably accepted.

369
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
So you have a couple people surrender, a couple people don't, that's confusing.

370
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
And this is interesting.

371
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:25.000
The Europeans never understood the bureful philosophy of inflicting damage and then escaping into the veld, which is like the open field, into the bush, basically.

372
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:35.000
To a burger and the term burger, in this case, it's basically the white citizens down there that control that we're in control.

373
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:45.000
To a burger, no position was worth dying for. If he could not retreat, he would surrender.

374
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Naturally, some might feel that horses only complicated the booers' position when kept to the rear and out of artillery range, the burger was capable of neither escaped nor pursued.

375
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
The boars seemed insecure without their horses and yet we're incapable of dealing with cavalry, when mounted.

376
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:14.000
So this is something that comes up a lot. You know, you had these brits where they look at, you know, the code of honor and they are, they're not going to surrender and they're going to fight to the death and they're going to hold positions if ordered.

377
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
And the boars are kind of like, hey, oh, why would I stay here?

378
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And if I, if I'm not just going to die on this hill, if we're going to lose the hill, I'm going to stay alive. I'm going to surrender.

379
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:34.000
So what you end up with is a really fluid element and you end up with a really rigid element.

380
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:47.000
As Commander and Chief, Boller violated one of the Cardinal Rules of Warfare, and this is kicking off the war by dividing the an inferior force faced with a more mobile enemy operating on interior lines.

381
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:56.000
So he, one of the first things that this guy, Boller does and interesting, it's not in this book, but I read it in some of the other literature about this.

382
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:06.000
This guy, Boller was like an old guy. I think he was 59 years old and he was kind of not in the best of health.

383
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:16.000
And the boars called him the Red Bull, because the name was Boller. They called him Red Bull, because his face was all, I'm imagine like, you know, the alcoholic kind of sunburned.

384
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:29.000
You know, guy, stereotypical guy, that's what he was. And so they kind of made fun of him. They called him Red Bull and he had some issues.

385
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:40.000
And this whole thing kicks off in this thing that they call in the British military the black week, because they took massive losses.

386
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Not just in personnel, but in on the battlefield. And even when they would might win a battle, they're losing so many people because they're doing their winning battles at a massive casualty rate.

387
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:09.000
So now it's it's starting to talk about the problems, the British army problems at the beginning of the war, and it says, you just need to look at how the various major commands were set up.

388
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:21.000
In the early part of the war, it says, by the Battle of Graspin, November 25th, 1899, the British had a four to one superiority, but it'd come to respect Boer firepower.

389
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:42.000
And this case in attempt was made to pin the enemy frontly with infantry, while a well-spaced calm of the naval brigade was to attack the Boer right. The tactically flexible Boers advanced to delay the pinning forces, while converging their fire on the blue jackets as they bunched up to ascend the slope.

390
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Despite suffering 50% casualties, the sailors broke through, supported somewhat belatedly by overwhelming numbers of infantry.

391
00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Again, the burgers evaded pursuit. The British still believed in their systems superiority, and overlooked then inflexibility of their open-order tactics.

392
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:15.000
The disproportionate nature of losses was still unclear. So they win this battle, but they take 50% casualties.

393
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And one of the things that they say is to cover up the low number of Boer casualties, stories circulated that the Boers had run away carrying their dead and wounded.

394
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:33.000
In reality, men really stopped to pick up their dead when they're being overrun. So the British kind of patded themselves on the back and said, well, you know, the Boers just took their dead with them.

395
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.000
That's why there's not many dead bodies here. You know, we have a done.

396
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I apologize to everyone in South Africa for my annihilation of all these words.

397
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Paul Slade, I apologize.

398
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:59.000
At the Battle of Modern River, the British once again fell victim to poor reconnaissance, methewan. So this is one of the major players here. This guy named methewan, a British guy.

399
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Expected that the Boer positions would be on the far side of the river utilizing the high ground and a village as a defensive line.

400
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Instead, Delare elected to place his man on the forward bank of the river in well came off-faged positions.

401
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:24.000
And Fassis was placed on grazing fire over the flat, felt while artillery ranging was a aided, aided by strategically placed white stones. Oh, that's mean.

402
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.000
So they set up visual targets that they could see and know the ranges of. Oh, that's nasty.

403
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
From trenches, the burgers could see three miles into methewan's rear.

404
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:47.000
As the British troops approached the river, the Boer's open fire, pinning them to the ground on coordinated advances increased the slaughter.

405
00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Boer Gunners concealed 200 yards forward of some building suspected of harboring them, re-tavic on the defense on the dense British artillery formations whose batteries had been withdrawn to 1400 yards to escape the burgers rifle fire and artillery fire.

406
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Charges were impossible when men had a crawl at 1200 yards and no one could safely ride horse back within 2,000 yards in the front.

407
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:19.000
So what happened here, let me break this out a little bit, you had the art, so you had the British advancing in an open field.

408
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
The Boer's let them get close enough so that they could start killing them with rifle fire.

409
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:37.000
When they get close enough and start killing them with rifle fire, which is probably 400, 500, 600 meters away, they start running away as they're out of range of the rifle fire, what comes in artillery.

410
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
The pre-determined artillery positions by white stones that they've laid out there.

411
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
This is crafty.

412
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:55.000
However, persistent pressure on the light, left flank, eventually carried the river line and the bought the British another victory at a disproportionate loss.

413
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
So eventually they keep, they get it done, right?

414
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
They have enough people to get around to a flank and they get it done.

415
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:11.000
The British Army of 1899 had in reality stumbled into World War I type of battlefield, the question remained as to whether it was to be treated as an aberration or something new.

416
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
It seemed easy to blame.

417
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:23.000
The near disaster on faulty maps, poor reconnaissance, disregarded information on Boer reinforcements and general misunderstanding of their intentions.

418
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
So isn't that interesting?

419
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Do we say, hey, that didn't seem to work out too well.

420
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Or do we say, you know, we didn't have good maps and our reconnaissance was very good and we didn't expect this from the Boers.

421
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
That's not taking extreme ownership.

422
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000
That's blaming everything else, not us, not us as leaders.

423
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Matthew and hope to cover his advance by means of heavy preliminary bombardment of the heights and now I'm fast forward a little bit, but the Boers would set up.

424
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:09.000
This is just, it seems so obvious right now, but instead of setting up in the perfect position, maybe on the crest of a hill where you have total high ground dominance,

425
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000
they put a little distraction up there and they'd set up in a different position, maybe lower on the hill or in the military crest, you know, maybe two thirds of a third of the way down the hill or whatever.

426
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:26.000
So as the, as the brits attack and they start bombing the top of the hill, because that's where they think they're going to be, they're not there.

427
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Under a driving range storm.

428
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The Highland Brigade Quarter column set off for Boer positions only be discovered a few hundred yards from the Boers' real positions.

429
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Within six minutes, unestimated 650 men lay dead or wounded on the belt.

430
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:59.000
For the rest of the day, the survivors suffered horribly as they were pinned down by fire, baked by the sun and ceaselessly attacked by the ants behind whose nests many of them hid.

431
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
By mid-afternoon, the brigade was in a route.

432
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The feet was clear cut, had methewan waited another day for the weather to clear he could have used his balloon to explore Boer positions.

433
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Too much faith had been placed in shrapnel.

434
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Then they, I don't know the other thing, I didn't talk about this, but the Boers would dig really good positions.

435
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
They would dig in.

436
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
They would set up on these hills and they would dig in and they kind of described what they would dig in.

437
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
They would dig in really deep foxholes that actually had a little kind of roofs on them as well.

438
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And the brits thought, hey, if we're for a huckin' bombs at these guys, they're all going to blow up, but they was having almost zero effect.

439
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because if you're in a hole in artillery shell hits near you, you're going to be okay.

440
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Unless it goes in the hole, you're going to be okay.

441
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So too much faith had been placed in shrapnel, which had been proven ineffective against the trenches.

442
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Poor reconnaissance ineffective artillery preparation in a complicated night attack.

443
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Are we doing things complicated? No.

444
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We're keeping it simple.

445
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And poor economy of force will hardly be the ingredients of success.

446
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000
So we have complicated attacks, or we're not obeying the law of simply keeping things simple, law of combat.

447
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And also poor economy of force. What that means is you're not prioritizing that cutie.

448
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You're not focusing your efforts on one thing.

449
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
And this is a common mistake that these guys made.

450
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Fast forward a little bit.

451
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000
While methewin may be accused of being unimaginative in his approach, such could not be said about general sirawilium gattaker,

452
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
who had actually ushered in the black week at Stormburg on December 12.

453
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.000
He proposed to achieve both strategic and tactical surprise by means of a long rail move,

454
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
followed by a 10 mile night march up the enemy positions before they were even new he was in the area.

455
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
He's got a pretty dynamic plan.

456
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Almost from the first his plan went awry.

457
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
After 17 hours in open top railway cars under the mid-summer sun,

458
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
his command became lost in its night march,

459
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
fearing discovery gattaker sent out no scouts.

460
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Or flanking columns as his men stumbled through the night.

461
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000
On clear as to his location he decided on a flank approached Stormburg rather than on the original direct attack,

462
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
but failed to communicate to his entire command.

463
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Storm march discipline alerted the local commando and the entire column was soon under attack.

464
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Artillery men with the sun in their eyes managed to only shell their own troops,

465
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
forcing them from a ridge line.

466
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
They were on the point of taking.

467
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
As miss hat followed confusion gattaker ordered a withdrawal,

468
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
only later to discover he had abandoned the fuselaire regimen.

469
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So, damn, this is just a very horrible thing.

470
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
You've got a blue on blue. You've got the team lost.

471
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You've got them leaving an element in the field.

472
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
The final defeat of Black Week was suffered by General Bullar at Colenso,

473
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
just 12 miles from Lady Smith.

474
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:29.000
A mere 6,000 boars repelled 21,000 British troops from behind a thinly held riverline.

475
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The boar position was by no means a strong one.

476
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
For a front of over 15 miles they had to hold two bridges and several fjords.

477
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000
The southern fjords were particularly vulnerable as they were situated barely within rifle range to their rear,

478
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
which formed a natural line of defense. As usual, a boar is ignored,

479
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
preliminary to bombardment and fired only when the British advanced.

480
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Once it became apparent that the boar medium and heavy guns far outrange the British,

481
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
comparable British pieces.

482
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So, this is the way this thing kicks off.

483
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Heard Yard, a tack went off first and was supposed to be closely supported by Colonel Long's field artillery.

484
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:24.000
The 1889 drillbook recommended that unsupported artillery not moved closer than 1700 yards from the enemy.

485
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Without notifying anyone long, advanced within 700 yards.

486
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
An unlimored and close-ordered, unlimored is when you detach your weapons from there.

487
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Like your big guns, you have monwheels, you detach them. It's unlimored, unlimored in close-order.

488
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Although this tactic worked in Egypt in 1881, here his gunners were shot capices by boar riflemen.

489
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Later, Long would claim he had intended to unlimored over 2,000 yards, but it had been deceived by the night.

490
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So he's making excuses.

491
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Butler was one of the most popular and personally brave commanders in the Army Hughes actually received any of the victorious cross of the highest award.

492
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
His care for men was legendary and closely entwined with his reforms in the Army Service Corps,

493
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
however, his preparations were overly meticulous.

494
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
And in the midst of the South African summer, his wagons carried great coats for the infantry.

495
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Gotta keep these guys warm. In South Africa, in the summer.

496
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Despite his concern for his men, Butler had proved a portrait commander who attacked with little knowledge of terrain or enemy dispositions.

497
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:50.000
His command control was an adequate order in precise and the withholding of two brigades in the face of a vastly outnumbered enemy was unprofessional.

498
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
This guy's making all kinds of mistakes. The defeats of the block week collectively had a greater impact than done Kirk.

499
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Britain at the peak of her powers had been mauled by a nation of farmers.

500
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:14.000
The insularity of decades was shattered, latent, latent, foreign, and a mosque revealed its safe itself in the international press.

501
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yet the nation rallied to meet its moment of crisis head on as thousands volunteered for service.

502
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Lord Roberts had been appointed to supersede, Mueller, when the latter in a fit of post-defeat depression had signal general right that he might consider surrender.

503
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Shaking by his demotion, Mueller resolved to attack a new before Roberts arrival by means of turning the bull right flank.

504
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So this is just like, I mean, can you imagine what this, the whole scenario is like this guy's, he's saying I'm going to surrender and then he flies off the handle because no, I'm going to attack him.

505
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I mean, we're just talking disaster.

506
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Emotional disaster.

507
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
The whole world knows that you just got beat by a bunch of farmers.

508
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I mean, you're that heavyweight champ.

509
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And you just had a guy show up in a whatever.

510
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He's waited 120 by your 300 pounds.

511
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
We're in basketball shorts. Yeah, he showed up wearing a basketball shorts, barefoot.

512
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Any kick your ass.

513
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So he goes to try and make this happen.

514
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Some 1700 men were to assault the hills, 1,740 feet high in the center of the brewer position.

515
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.000
The rest of the butbullers, 20,000 men were to look on and do nothing.

516
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
This is where you got to prioritize next to you.

517
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
You understand that prioritize next to you means you're going to take your resources that you have and you're going to focus them on getting something done.

518
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Instead of saying, well, I'm going to keep reserves over here.

519
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm going to keep reserves over here.

520
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'm going to send you know, and I'm going to send 1700 people to take a thousand of 1700 foot tall tall hill.

521
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I got 20,000 people. This is no brainer. You want me to take that hill?

522
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The best. My number one priority. Cool. Watch this.

523
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:14.000
The boars had neglected to occupy much of its key position, but the British failed to make the most of the opportunity in accurately exploring or enhancing it.

524
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So they get the hill incorrectly cited shadow trenches were dug by 20 sappers while over a thousand men lay idle.

525
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So they get this hilltop and I got to continue it.

526
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Normally, a Italian was was allocated 70 spades, but they had been left behind in the Ascent.

527
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Colonel Maurice complained, somehow our soldiers by dint of perverse training have imbibed the idea that there is somehow that there is something cowardly and sneakish about sitting behind cover in the field.

528
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Or at any rate, if they have to get into trenches and works, it is the royal engineers province to provide these defenses.

529
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:09.000
So these guys got up on top of the hill and were like, hey, there's a thousand soldiers on top of the hill. There's 20 people, 20 engineers to dig and they sit back and watch.

530
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
A because they think it's cowardly and b they think that's not my job.

531
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:22.000
If this is, what's weird about this happening?

532
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Right, like we're looking back and up can you imagine you're sitting there is thousands of people. You know you could be attacked and you're thinking, I'm not picking up a shovel.

533
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And by the way, we didn't even bring shovels and by the way, we only have 70 shovels for a whole battalion.

534
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Yeah, I mean, you think that in that situation, that's just kind of the left over added to all the straight up prevalent attitude of not having to really fight fight fight fight, you know.

535
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Yeah, because you've never had your ass kicked.

536
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Yeah, so like you took a shot and now you're like, I'm not going to worry about that.

537
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Yeah, it's going to be okay.

538
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000
You get taken down like after the first round and the first round you get taken down and then your coach, you know in between rounds the corner man says, you're doing great.

539
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah, no, you're not.

540
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah, and he's like, I remember.

541
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So back long time ago, right, before people knew about judyatu, so this guy, it was actually my friend told me the story about when he got in a fight and he just learned judyatu.

542
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:40.000
And I'm trying to remember the exact situation, but he basically says the story where he got in a fight with a guy and then the guy, you know, they got in the fight or the and he choked him up, right, and when he woke back up, he wanted to fight again.

543
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Of course.

544
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:51.000
So before they fought again, he was like, yeah, I'm going to, it's like, yeah, you keep, you give me with that sneak attack stuff, right, almost like they're not fighting or something.

545
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Yeah, almost like that's just doesn't count.

546
01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yeah, I don't think I own it's kind of cowardly or whatever, you know, it's like, yeah, they start or the guy who gets taken down right here and you see this, actually even now he gets taken down.

547
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Oh, we're just wrestling me.

548
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Once they just wrestling, he's looking at the raft like, raf, stand us up kind of thing, like almost complaining about certain situations in the middle of the fight.

549
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So it's kind of like that's that situation right there, like, oh, I'm not taking nothing.

550
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Yeah, we don't do that. Yeah, probably you're a fight, you're in a war, by the way. So they just don't realize it almost, you know.

551
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Continuing on, while virtually the entire British army stood idle, the Boor army was free to focus his attention and artillery on the hilltop position.

552
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Lacking shelter proper equipment lines, clear lines of authority or knowledge that artillery was flying the on the way up, the British abandoned the position as untenable.

553
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
This is farmers.

554
01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The superior, the superiority of the individual Boor marksman and the inadequacy of this small British small unit tactics was never more in evidence throughout the day one brigade had carried the fighting.

555
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:17.000
One demonstrated and three stayed in reserve of further testament to poor tax Greece. You had three other brigades.

556
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Five thousand, I'm guessing it's, you know, no, no, all brigade might be like 5,000 people.

557
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
That's insane.

558
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:36.000
The dealers qualities as a commander or in many ways indicative of the army. You did not know when to draw the line with his subordinates. And this is interesting.

559
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Heart was still, so one of his subordinates, heart was still marching his men and quarter columns at the second battle of Colenso, despite being told not to.

560
01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:02.000
The warren was allowed inordinate freedom despite compromising the entire battle. At other times, Boor interfered with poor results, such as at twin peaks, he lacked a sense of terrain.

561
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:13.000
In sufficient perseverance, time and time again, robbed him of victory, as did his hoarding of reserves, as if his troops were 18th century professionals.

562
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:30.000
First, Battle of Colenso, only 4,800 men out of a force of 21,000 were engaged at any one time. And at Spine Cop, 3,000 men out of 24,000.

563
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Staff problems be deviled to his battles. Chained a commands were unclear and artillery was frequently misplaced or uncordinated.

564
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:50.000
In addition, strong, wild and ambitious subordinates such as warrener long and heart were difficult to control. Boorler became, Boorler came to appreciate the value of cover.

565
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Rushes and creeping barrage and according to Marisa's official history was the original originator of curtain fire at the second battle of Colenso.

566
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Now, he started catching on a little bit, he now used mounted troops as a maneuver element on the flanks of infantry. The new battle field involved protracted fire fights along extensive front coordinated with precise artillery support and an incest and creeping forward of the infantry.

567
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Whereas Boorler had taken several months and three major engagements to develop a counter to the Boor methods of warfare, Robert, so a guy gets sent down to take his place, Robert's ride, Robert's arrived in South Africa with his own strong preconceptions.

568
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:51.000
The old India hand, he placed his faith in cavalry and mobility rather than firepower. Robert set a ride and cape early in January to find the army everywhere in retreat. Rather than create, this is interesting. Rather than create immediate political problems.

569
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:10.000
He allowed Boorler and Mithuan to stay in command, although with limited forces, this is like a little play in the game. So instead of just coming down there firing these guys, he knew that that would be very disrupted, so he kept them there. He just gave him like really small elements to control.

570
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Robert would always remain careful with generals associated with woesley ring with the woesley ring. So there was a guy named General Woesley who saw a War hero and a general and he had like its crew.

571
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And these guys were part of his crew. And he, you know, the, this guy General Woesley Garrett Woesley was a War hero and a general and a powerful guy. And so he had a crew and these guys were part of that crew. And so he was also, that's another reason why I can't blame him.

572
01:16:40.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Oh, okay, you know. Not just going to come down there and fire these guys because Woesley's got a lot of power. The entire army was suffused with pettingness Hamilton and little tin lost no opportunity to betray Butler and clearly and clear he constantly fought Warren and little son. So you just have like babies right.

573
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Robert's funneled all reinforcements to the cape rather than Natal despite an increasing numeric predominance. He lulled the boars into the belief that he was tied to the railways.

574
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:27.000
So the brits and I haven't really talked about the brits were using the railways to run their supplies and stuff like that. And so he's kind of, he's kind of letting the boars think that we're addicted to the railways.

575
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:35.000
When ready in late January, Robert's massive army struck for to the east threatening boars supply lines as the boars withdrew from their earlier block in persistence.

576
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:49.000
French is this is one of the brit generals, French's entire cavalry division. The largest such british unit in history was launched around their flank for the relief of Kimberly.

577
01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:03.000
With victory so close, fast forward a little bit, they continue to kind of do well. The brits now under Robert's with victory so close. Nature now intervened for Robert was incapacitated by a cold. You got sick.

578
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And Kitsner, his chief of staff assumed command. Kitsner launched an immediate concentric assault against the boars which now which most veterans realized had little chance of success.

579
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:31.000
More than a core was thrown into the fruitless and uncorrelated attacks. So this is ridiculous. So this guy, Robert's is doing pretty well. Kitsner takes over because Robert's literally gets a cold.

580
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:39.000
When this guy takes over man, he just goes, gets, he goes hard. He's trying to get a name for himself.

581
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And he starts all these attacks trying to basically surround the boars.

582
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:55.000
More than a core was thrown into the fruitless and uncorrelated attack, commanders were ignored. Kitsner wrote about the field directing battalions and raising havoc.

583
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Frustration mountain is mounted as battled daysed men began to trickle back from the front line and wander about for lack of orders to entrench.

584
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
As Kitsner attempted to launch yet another attack, he stripped troops from a key terrain feature.

585
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:24.000
This guy is just a micromanager just trying to make things happen. It's horrible to read. Once back in command, Robert ceased further assaults and resorted to 10 days of bombardment and a final night attack.

586
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So isn't it? You know, we always talk about how leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

587
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And I skipped the whole chunk of where everything's just falling apart. Kitsner suffered 1,200 casualties. He almost lost one of the major cities.

588
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Ridiculous. So Robert's comes back in and just stop.

589
01:19:46.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And then he kind of starts these more methodical attacks and continues that the start and stop offenses of Robert's head, but one objective, the capture of the Boer capitals and with that the presumed end of the war.

590
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Despite continued guerilla attacks, Portoria, the second Boer capital fell on June 4th. The link of a general Boer on July 4th signal the end to all conventional resistance. By mid December, Roberts had departed and Kitsner was left in charge of mopping up operations.

591
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So that's kind of the the overview of how it went down. At least up till that point the most general examination of British army's performance in South Africa reveals flaws on virtually every level of command.

592
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Lord Wolsey, this is the guy I just talked about. The commander and chief had been excluded as the field commander on account of his age.

593
01:20:44.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Army and royal politics along with anti-India prejudice served to eliminate various other candidates for the post and general Boer rose to the top of the list despite his recent poor showing in maneuvers and lack of independent command experience.

594
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Although an able staff officer like most British officers, he confused personal bravery with the ability to lead Narmee.

595
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:18.000
This is just a common theme and I'm not hitting as much of it as I should in the book, but this idea of the brits that like personal bravery was going to be enough to win the day.

596
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It's so strange to badmouth that, right? Because courage is you know, one of the most.

597
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:40.000
The most powerful characteristics that we can envision a human being with, right? This ultimate level of courage and sacrifice.

598
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But in many ways, it was a negative quality because they thought if they had that they're good to go. You know, then this you want to take it back to the MMA.

599
01:21:47.000 --> 01:22:01.000
You know, you see that one guy that's all kinds of fired up, but he's yelling and screaming for a fight and he's highly motivated. He might even be training really hard in his strength and conditioning.

600
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And he might be ready to go the distance. He might be ready to die when he goes in the ring.

601
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And it doesn't matter when you get in there again someone that has better skill than you and that out maneuvers you, all that courage and bravery doesn't do a damn thing, but get you killed.

602
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So I guess it's not that crazy to look at that characteristic from a different angle.

603
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:33.000
If you're putting your whole, now look, if you have a fighter that's a whim, right, that lacks any kind of courage, a lack bravery, right? They're not even going to get in the cage.

604
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They're going to be scared to get hit. They're going to run away and they're going to lose, but you have to have both. You have to have courage. You have to have skill.

605
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yeah, I mean, to add to that to, you know, you get a guy MMA again, a guy who's like his, you know, he's a great wrestler, great grappler, good submission guy, whatever.

606
01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:03.000
And then the other guys may be a really good striker and he talks a lot of trash and interviews and stuff. So he gets some of the guy's skin, the guy goes in super mad, super fired up, super motivated.

607
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I'm going to, I'm going to basically beat him. That is only how I'm going to knock him out. I'm going to strike, you know, rather than strategically go for, you know, make yourself in a better position as far as like tactically strategically whatever.

608
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:23.000
And then he starts to stand well, many get knocked out. Of course. You can be motivated, but rather guys would just wait better than you, you've got to be smarter than that, you know, kind of thing.

609
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yeah, it feels like that's what they're doing to.

610
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Yeah.

611
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Now, so that kind of wraps up some overviews of what happened on the ground and look, like I said, there's, there's, I got some books that are first person perspective on the ground.

612
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Boo or war.

613
01:23:46.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And what we can go into those, I'm sure we will at some point. But where this book goes next is how they took the lessons learned and what they did with those lessons learned, positive and negative.

614
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:18.000
But as I sit here and look at my notes, it's, it's, it's not short. There's a lot of things that got learned and there's a lot of lessons that they incorporated and there's a lot of lessons that they didn't.

615
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Or there's lessons that they made progress towards and then backed away from.

616
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:32.000
So, rather than do it right now, I want to leave enough time for that. So, let's call it.

617
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And we'll pick up the Boer War Military Reforms on episode 2303. So, in the meantime, echo Charles.

618
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Yes.

619
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Since we are trying to learn.

620
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Oh, yeah.

621
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
So, we are trying to make progress.

622
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Yes.

623
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
How can we continue to make progress as individual humans?

624
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
First off, making progress isn't always comfortable.

625
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
It's not always painless.

626
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:14.000
But, good news about that is we have help. So, speaking of pain and growing pain, if you will.

627
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
So, join to get a little sore when you left.

628
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Indeed.

629
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And, I got to be honest, I've been out of the supplementation situation for a little bit. This is a little while ago, a few weeks ago.

630
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
But, I got the replenishment of supplements.

631
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And what I'm talking about is...

632
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
That's bad planning.

633
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yeah.

634
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Yeah.

635
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Do you sound like the British Army on that one?

636
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
No, no, no.

637
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Look around.

638
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Things to blame.

639
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
You know, I got busy caught up.

640
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Nonetheless, anyway, what I'm saying is, look, when we're on the path, we go hard.

641
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Most of the time.

642
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
I'm not saying go hard into the ground.

643
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I'm saying you go hard.

644
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
You know, you got to progress demands.

645
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Hard work.

646
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
We got to push the envelope.

647
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Got to push the envelope.

648
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I heard a quote from Denzel Washington.

649
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
He said, ease is a greater threat to progress than a hardship is.

650
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
That's like, oh, that was pretty good.

651
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Concert.

652
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
It's true.

653
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It's very true.

654
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
But, through that hardship, you get joint pains.

655
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Sometimes.

656
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Sometimes.

657
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
For Denzel Washington.

658
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
For Denzel Washington.

659
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
For Worked is whole life, too.

660
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
And she's this level of skill.

661
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And you just took his, his quote and turned it into your little personal advertisement for

662
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
joint work for.

663
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Well, that's what just happened.

664
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
It's, I more turned it into my personal eye.

665
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Apologize to you, Mr. Denzel Washington.

666
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yeah.

667
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Well, I'm going to let echo roll.

668
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
He'd be happy because I'm incorporating that into,

669
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
how should I say my, my daily, my life, my approach to life.

670
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
How about that?

671
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Don't seek ease.

672
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Don't seek the rest between sets.

673
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Oh, you got to take the rest between sets.

674
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But don't seek the rest between sets.

675
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Nonetheless.

676
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Anyway, when you're basically when you join,

677
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
skits sore, take joint warfare because it actually works.

678
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
You're going to set that last four minutes ago.

679
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
You know, yeah, like, yeah, you're probably right about that.

680
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
You know what I saw a video of.

681
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So many posted, so many posted the support section,

682
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
but they were just listening to you talk and listening to you and I go back

683
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
to work, but they were laughing and staring.

684
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
And I was like, that's a good thing to see.

685
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Well, yeah, it's a good thing to see.

686
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Yeah.

687
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Because most of the time I'm figuring this, the number of people listening right now,

688
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
zero.

689
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Like when they, when they hear me say,

690
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
okay, echo, they go, oh, yeah, fuck.

691
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That's over.

692
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Or I cast his old fast forward to, you think they're missing an agent.

693
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
If they did that, they just missed a Denzel Washington quote.

694
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Yeah, tell us what we're talking about.

695
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Ease is a greater threat to hardship than,

696
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
or sorry, Ease is a greater threat to progress than comfort than hardship is.

697
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Ease is okay.

698
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Got it.

699
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Yeah, good.

700
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
We'll give some props to Denzel Washington.

701
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
It was good.

702
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
But anybody that pressed stop a little early,

703
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
they didn't get to hear that.

704
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Oh, they missed it from you slash Denzel Denzel.

705
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Oh, man.

706
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
All right, well, there you go.

707
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And like I said, joint warfare.

708
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
If you don't have joint, where if we get joint warfare.

709
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
That's your whole point.

710
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
That is the point.

711
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
That is the whole point.

712
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
That's why Denzel Washington said what he said.

713
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Yeah, one of the reasons.

714
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
One of the reasons why he said.

715
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
He said, when did you get your warfare in Creloyle?

716
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That was money is trying to say.

717
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Yeah, essentially.

718
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That is core.

719
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
That's what it meant for sure.

720
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Don't forget about the, don't forget about the discipline.

721
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
The discipline go in cans.

722
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
The discipline powder form, jockel Palmer.

723
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
My recommended scenario.

724
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Why?

725
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Because it tastes like an Arnold Palmer iced tea with the perfect amount of lemonade in there.

726
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It's kind of as little bit of sweetness to it.

727
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
But it's sweetened with monk fruit.

728
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Yeah.

729
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That's not sugar.

730
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You're all good.

731
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
You're not going to need insulin spike.

732
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
No, you're going smooth flat line that thing.

733
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Easy money.

734
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And you'll get a little bit of a little bit of hype.

735
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
A little bit of a.

736
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
You know, you have that noise that you use for a sound effect.

737
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It's like that high pitched like thing that's being prepared.

738
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
What's the noise?

739
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
There's a name.

740
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Well, there's two of them with the one you're talking about is like,

741
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
It's basically like a, you know, the old school flash.

742
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yes, from a camera.

743
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It feels like things are about to prep.

744
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah.

745
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Things are about to go off.

746
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
So we do.

747
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
We need to, you can edit this.

748
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
You can put it when I say you get that little and you can put it right.

749
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
So I'm going to do it.

750
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
So I'm going to give you a little spot when you get that little.

751
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Boom.

752
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
There you go.

753
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
There you go.

754
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And that's the discipline go.

755
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yeah.

756
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Imagine if you did all your, all your CGI into the actual podcast.

757
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And I was talking about covering fire and there was machine guns going off.

758
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
That'd be the most popular podcast of all thought.

759
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Tracer's coming between us.

760
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Yeah.

761
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
That could be something.

762
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
There'd be horses getting killed.

763
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
You know, my horses got killed in the Boor wards crazy.

764
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Yeah.

765
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yeah.

766
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yeah.

767
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I think that'd be kind of the strategy in a way.

768
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Or kill horses.

769
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Yeah.

770
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Get the horses.

771
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I think you're trying to kill with people.

772
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
But yeah.

773
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
But if we're trying to kill the enemy, the enemy horses, I guess.

774
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
All right.

775
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
In there.

776
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Yeah.

777
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Stop their mobility.

778
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Right.

779
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Like, and it's a big target.

780
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
You know, I don't know.

781
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I've never tried to kill horses.

782
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So, you know, I don't have that experience.

783
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
What else we got?

784
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
On the last moke.

785
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So speaking of moke.

786
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I made a moke shake last night.

787
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
That's it.

788
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So I mixed them dark chocolate and the peanut butter chocolate.

789
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Right.

790
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Whatever.

791
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
You know, not much of a deviation.

792
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It's not like a mixed strawberry with, you know, with it.

793
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Anyway.

794
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And so the thing is, I haven't had a moke chicken a while in front of the kids.

795
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And they, you know, they don't know.

796
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
They think I'm making like, I don't know.

797
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Some dessert.

798
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Mm-hmm.

799
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
You know.

800
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And so they're like, yeah, I want some.

801
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Some like cool.

802
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And I give them some.

803
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
They drink the whole thing.

804
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Mm-hmm.

805
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Regular won't.

806
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Can you imagine like, you can just give yours kids something that makes them so strong and healthy.

807
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And they think that they're, that they're just a great dad.

808
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Like they scored.

809
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.000
That's literally what I thought they're looking at me kind of like, like, can we actually

810
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
have that cause it's big.

811
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Mm-hmm.

812
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And you know, there are two kids that drink.

813
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
You're like, drink a little thing.

814
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
No, I wasn't taking it back.

815
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I wanted to because you know, it was mine.

816
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
But at the same time I was like, I'm going to have that at it because it was just so,

817
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
it brought so much happiness.

818
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.36
Did you see your did you see your son starting to get a little bit jacked

819
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.94
Yep, that's just the ways buddy is drink one milkshake boom jacked that's a gear that's actually

01:31:31.94 --> 01:31:37.46

821
01:31:38.46 --> 01:31:40.80

01:31:46.04 --> 01:31:49.88
You can get all this stuff at the vitamin chopper your vitamin shop opens up

825
01:31:50.14 --> 01:31:57.14
Choco fuel. Yep. That's what it's called a parent. Yes. Also what we're doing is due to okay

826
01:31:57.14 --> 01:32:02.84
Look varying levels of participation due to arena understand and I think it's gonna slowly

827
01:32:02.84 --> 01:32:08.98
I slowly this tournament's going on. Yeah. Yeah, so hey, that's something some people are making it happen. Yeah

828
01:32:08.98 --> 01:32:13.04
Good so anyway, so we're doing due to we're starting due to you

829
01:32:13.04 --> 01:32:16.44
We're continuing due to so when we do due to this and we need to get an origin gear

830
01:32:16.44 --> 01:32:22.84
We already know that 100% because they're the best geese straight up. That's the the number the primary

831
01:32:24.12 --> 01:32:25.12
situation

832
01:32:25.12 --> 01:32:29.12
factually factually as you like to see even yeah, and

833
01:32:29.92 --> 01:32:34.64
They happen to be made in a marriage that will happen to be made in a matter of a problem

834
01:32:36.04 --> 01:32:41.24
the fact that these geese are so comfortable that Denzel

835
01:32:41.24 --> 01:32:45.52
Is sort of you know at parade rest over in the corner of the shed

836
01:32:45.52 --> 01:32:49.92
Headstand boys what's up? It's a good that's a good question

837
01:32:50.60 --> 01:32:57.72
Because when you put the rift geon you you you're you're in a different world of due to you're in a different world of

838
01:32:57.72 --> 01:33:04.08
due to when you put the rift geon yeah fully and the thing is you feel it and here's the thing I think about most of us is like

839
01:33:04.08 --> 01:33:06.56
We get used to nice stuff you just get used to it

840
01:33:06.56 --> 01:33:13.32
So you could not go back. It's like if you ever found an airplane first class it's an economy sucks forever

841
01:33:13.32 --> 01:33:15.32
I know man. When you put on a rift geey

842
01:33:16.40 --> 01:33:20.64
Every other geey that you put on front the rest of your life is economy class

843
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:29.96
That's what's happening. It's a visceral insult to my sense. Yeah, do you you in the old days

844
01:33:30.12 --> 01:33:35.08
Man, I had some geese that I felt like I was putting on something that was made out of concrete

845
01:33:35.08 --> 01:33:37.08
That's what I was feeling

846
01:33:37.08 --> 01:33:38.08
This is

847
01:33:38.28 --> 01:33:44.20
It's good. It's not concrete at all. It's luxurious. I'm gonna say it's luxurious straight up and

848
01:33:44.56 --> 01:33:49.64
They happen to me so I actually do say happened to be made in America, but they're not they don't have been

849
01:33:49.64 --> 01:33:51.40
No, I mean

850
01:33:51.40 --> 01:33:57.72
Han purpose it's kind of one of the purposes behind them. Yeah, and also speaking of just

851
01:33:58.60 --> 01:34:00.60
Next level first class

852
01:34:01.32 --> 01:34:03.32
Sorry, Dan's out comfort

853
01:34:03.32 --> 01:34:07.48
Get yourself some delta 68 jeans which are

854
01:34:08.36 --> 01:34:15.88
We need it's like another category you've clothing because you not you're not feeling like you're wearing jeans, right?

855
01:34:16.92 --> 01:34:21.68
You're not feeling like oh I gotta put these jeans on them and I'm gonna feel constricted and hot

856
01:34:22.76 --> 01:34:27.40
Now you put it on the delta 68's you're ready just to do a straight up

857
01:34:27.56 --> 01:34:29.56
You know maneuver

858
01:34:29.56 --> 01:34:38.28
Yeah, you're ready to do a go-go plotter in those things. Yeah, so you kind of think of it and not to go to deep into a tangent

859
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Far beyond for me, but

860
01:34:41.40 --> 01:34:47.92
You just say far be it for you to go to a day. It's if you know from okay, yes, but you know, okay

861
01:34:47.92 --> 01:34:51.92
So there's a difference between ease and comfort and

862
01:34:53.08 --> 01:34:54.44
functionality

863
01:34:54.44 --> 01:35:01.24
It's your maximizing your functionality and a because of comfort. Yeah, right? Yeah, yeah, so yeah

864
01:35:01.24 --> 01:35:04.60
And even saying comfort is kind of misleading so look if I have a sword

865
01:35:04.60 --> 01:35:11.68
I'm fighting in a battle with a sword and this sword is ergonomically designed for my hand

866
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:17.64
ergonomics right performance will increase and it's a benefit. Yeah, it's comfortable. Yes, you're doing better

867
01:35:17.64 --> 01:35:23.08
You're more it whether it be efficient more functional more everything comfortable. Yes, but more

868
01:35:23.08 --> 01:35:29.20
Seems same so that's the delta 68 scenario that will work good like when you go in a battle

869
01:35:29.20 --> 01:35:34.04
If let's say you go in a battle and you have that sword that ergonomically fits your hand

870
01:35:34.04 --> 01:35:40.28
That is gonna be work really good until I cut your freaking arm off because that's what I'm gonna do

871
01:35:42.52 --> 01:35:46.92
Yeah, you took it in their interesting direction, you know as far as the point, but you know

872
01:35:46.92 --> 01:35:51.22
I dig it in your probably right, but you're less in order to know where they're saying that you get this

873
01:35:51.22 --> 01:35:56.70
Irgonomically correct sword and that's gonna be well difference. It's fine saying bring it

874
01:35:56.70 --> 01:36:03.70
Yeah, I cut your damn arm off. Yeah, you realize you just assumed that I was going into battle against you

875
01:36:03.98 --> 01:36:05.98
Yeah, I'm here

876
01:36:05.98 --> 01:36:12.26
You're like I here. All right. Hey, you're right and you do make a good point on top of my original point for sure

877
01:36:12.26 --> 01:36:15.96
And I haven't even really trained much sword, but I will start training. You're yeah

878
01:36:15.96 --> 01:36:19.22
You're down. You have a lot of what do you call bravery and I don't care

879
01:36:19.22 --> 01:36:22.78
You know what it doesn't matter ergonomically correct or not. I'm taking your arm off

880
01:36:22.78 --> 01:36:27.18
Huh strategically. That's the move. That's what we're doing. Yeah, and you you can get change

01:39:39.54 --> 01:39:43.14
That's gonna that's gonna that's gonna detach that's gonna look around

927
01:39:43.14 --> 01:39:45.22

01:43:18.58 --> 01:43:23.14
You know all of a sudden there's a zulu warrior over my shoulder or whatever you know

980
01:43:23.14 --> 01:43:25.14
I am yeah, that's that's a thing

981
01:43:25.14 --> 01:43:30.18
Why is it that you claim to be the creative guy and I'm over here coming up with all the ideas?

982
01:43:30.18 --> 01:43:32.18
I don't have you notice that? No

983
01:43:32.18 --> 01:43:35.94
Where are you at? I don't think you are why am I covering the movie?

984
01:43:36.74 --> 01:43:39.22
For this whole thing how about this we'll look into it cool?

985
01:43:39.22 --> 01:43:44.18
Okay, if you don't put a special effect at least one thing that happens

986
01:43:45.14 --> 01:43:49.30
During the podcast you're disappointing everybody that's here

987
01:43:50.02 --> 01:43:53.54
I'm sure that's actually correct. Oh, I guarantee that's factually correct

988
01:43:55.06 --> 01:43:57.94
You know when we did the audiobooks for extreme ownership and that I caught a

989
01:43:57.94 --> 01:44:02.58
Be a leadership extreme ownership so if you listen the extreme ownership audiobook I don't want to

990
01:44:03.38 --> 01:44:08.82
Try and make it sound crazy, but there's audio effects in there. Yes, there's machine gun fire

991
01:44:09.14 --> 01:44:14.74
There's the call the prayer there's some explosions and when we when we decided to do that

992
01:44:14.74 --> 01:44:19.86
Well first of the main reason as late for night we've got like words written in there like

993
01:44:19.86 --> 01:44:43.22
Pup, pup, pup, pup, like machine gun fire and I don't want to start off the chapter going you know

994
01:44:43.22 --> 01:44:48.74
There's one enemy trace around zipping overhead right I don't want to have to make that noise so

995
01:44:49.62 --> 01:44:53.14
What we did was they put special effects in there and the the company

996
01:44:53.70 --> 01:44:58.02
The the publisher was kind of acting they were cool, but they were kind of acting like this was

997
01:44:59.62 --> 01:45:02.26
Like it was crazy like it was a little bit of a crazy idea

998
01:45:02.42 --> 01:45:05.46
So anyways they did it and that's a lot of people are stoked on it

999
01:45:05.46 --> 01:45:09.46
But you got to be ready for it because if you're driving your car and you're an explosion or machine gun fire

1000
01:45:09.46 --> 01:45:14.66
Especially if you've been in the game, you know like for real you might get a little bit of like a little bit of a

1001
01:45:15.22 --> 01:45:18.18
adrenaline flow no big deal all good so

1002
01:45:18.90 --> 01:45:25.46
Yeah, maybe so I think that the same way that that will enhance the audio books for the dichotomy leadership

1003
01:45:26.02 --> 01:45:28.02
and and extreme ownership

1004
01:45:29.38 --> 01:45:32.10
If someone had their requisite skills

1005
01:45:33.06 --> 01:45:36.10
To actually make something cool in here it'd be good

1006
01:45:36.10 --> 01:45:41.46
All right well keep it in mind okay, we also have psychological warfare if you need a little

1007
01:45:42.02 --> 01:45:44.34
