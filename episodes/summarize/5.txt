I think I think I would argue that most people after training, due to it's too unless it is like just a light like roll, but if you're, you know, if you're doing just, I don't know, the normal due to it's a guy. So that's, that's the, in a nutshell, and if you want to get with the experts, then people like Garantoms, people like Peter at the, people like Dom Dagestino, they're the ones that, you know, can give you the science behind what I'm talking about or what I've experienced as well. You know, and not that you don't have rolls and good rolls and you go hard, but there is a difference between like, I want to let this guy pass my guard or I'm going to, I'm going to hang on with every little piece of my, and what does this look you're giving me right now? And there's, you know, there's like a standard, I don't know what, you know, there's a standard of two millimeters, let's say. Yeah, it's basically about focus but this is one of those things and this is, this is I'm starting to realize a underlying theme with a lot of with a lot of what people are asking me and that is I think people have a vision or a thought that I've got some answer that is like, oh, you lack focus. And this got me thinking about my kids and one of my daughters who, when she was, I don't know what, how old you are when you're supposed to learn the time is tables, which she was that age and she got really disappointed because she didn't know our time's tables. So out of that, you know, spawned this, and the other thing was cool, the, you know, wrongs was, you know, we were not drinking, we were not at drugs and either was wrongs. When you when you say put words on paper, is that like an official thing, you know, like when you get written up at work or something, it's like here's a real warning. She doesn't know him and she starts getting this, this negative attitude of, I'm stupid, you know, I'm dumb, other kids know him. You know, if you want to talk about why I do that, if you, you know, there's a book called Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Tombs, which is a fantastic book, and gives a lot of background on it. And I thought to myself, just what I said, I thought, okay, you know what, maybe he's rubbing the people the wrong way and then people are little intimidated by that. So it's like going from a job that's like a sport, which is the Seal teams going into a job that's more of a job. I'm going to use that, you know, so you're going to you're going to get way more results potentially than you would if you simply don't do anything and what if the inspiration doesn't come back, which it's okay, it doesn't. But this type of thing is a little bit, you know, because normally you're just trying to bring someone along and help them out and improve their leadership, you know, it's just mentoring. You know, and it's there we get into kind of the things I think I talked about this last week, but you know, shut off the music. oh yeah, this, this guy's like, oh, so you know, this, I relate to this guy, because I want to be strong. And you know, I'm not going to go into crazy detail on that because in our book, that that life and I wrote, you know, there's a chapter and it's called belief. When you get the chance, let us know what you think and let the world know what you think. And a lot of times people think because I'm a seal and I'm aggressive that I'm like this kind of burn bridges type of person, right? If they're like, oh, you know what, I know I made a mistake. And then another good thing, on the Tim Ferriss podcast, he did an interview with Dom Dagestino, who's got a really good perspective, another doctor that's, you know, a workout guy, and understanding nutrition very well. It's going to come clear like, okay, that thing that I wrote or, you know, put it in when I wasn't inspired.
