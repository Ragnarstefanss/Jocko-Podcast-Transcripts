00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50 This is Jockel podcast number 179, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:09.50 Good evening echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.50 --> 00:00:20.50 So, the spear dains and days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.
00:00:20.50 --> 00:00:26.000 We have heard of those princes, heroic campaigns.
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000 There was shield sheafs in, scourge of many tribes, a record of meat, benches, rampaging among foes.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000 This terror of the hall troops had come far.
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000 A fowlling to start with, he would flourish later on, as his powers waxed and his worth was proved.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000 In the end, each clan on outline coasts beyond the whale road had to yield to him and begin to pay tribute.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000 That was one good king.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 Boom.
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000 Opening with a little bit of bear wolf and that is the opening of bear wolf, translated by Shemest Haney.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000 What I notice is even back in the day in the opening of the original old English poem, the first one written.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000 What are they talking about? They're talking about war and they're talking about leadership.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000 And you can hear in the beginning he was a little bit of a weak leader. He was a foundling to start with.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000 But he would flourish later on, became a good king.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And that's what happens. You learn, you get better.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000 And that is why we talk about war and leadership here and speaking of war and leadership back for a third time.
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000 My brother, Jason Gardner, retired, Master Chief, who I've known since I got into the teams in the early 90s.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000 He's been on the podcast before.
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000 If you haven't listened to 167 and 168, go listen to those first.
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000 There's a lot of ground covered in those podcasts.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000 And I told him to listen in and listen to him again and see which what we missed.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000 So we can go back and that's what we're going to do now.
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000 Cover some more ground, hit some of that stuff that we missed.
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000 So welcome back, Jason.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000 Thank you.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000 Check.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000 When I first got that translation, which was actually when I was in college, and it starts off with.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000 So, by just saying, oh my god, this is literally legit.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000 So I start things with so a lot now when I write, I do that.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000 I do that.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000 So yeah, welcome back.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000 How's retirement treating you?
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000 Good to go.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000 I was going to say awesome, but I'd be awesome, absolutely, two death in the last two podcasts.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 So I'm going to try and ban it.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000 Did you have a cell phone, California, childhood, creep out with some awesome.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000 Yes.
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000 Everything is awesome.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000 Yep.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 So you're going to watch out for that.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000 So what do we miss?
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000 I don't miss something from your youth.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000 Where are you talking about the best show you ever saw?
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000 The best punk rock show you ever saw?
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000 Yeah.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000 There was a one that, and this is before I could even drive,
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000 buddy, a mine just in Hawkins and Alicio went up to this, this gig at Cyprus College.
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.000 And it was DI, plain rap, the Dickies, the Vandals, the Circle Jerks.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000 There might have been one other band for seven dollars in pre-sale.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000 Yeah.
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000 So we got pre-sale tickets.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000 We went up there.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000 God in, there was probably about 500 people outside who weren't able to get in,
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 because it sold out.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000 So they just went ahead and knocked the doors down and all flooded in.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000 So what that meant was nobody got searched coming in for security.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 And people had crazy stuff like firecrackers.
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000 It was way overcrowded for, you know, what the safe, safe amount for the building was.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000 So when you went up by where the doors were, the security guys had just put,
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000 pushed all these tables and chairs and we're sitting on them up against the doors to keep anybody else from coming in.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000 And the, the show was just unreal.
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000 There were three mosh pits.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000 And then when the Circle Jerks came out, they opened up with wild on the streets.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000 The whole floor exploded.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000 One of the pits started floating, crashed into another pit.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000 People were throwing bricks of firecrackers around.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 It was mass band amounting with so much fun.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000 And so you were like 14 or 15?
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000 15 years old.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000 Yeah.
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000 My mom had dropped me off.
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000 I dropped this off there.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000 Oh, that's awesome.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000 Yeah, she's got to go.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000 That's great away.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000 Yeah.
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Because a lot of times if your parents, if parents try to shield their kids from that,
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000 or they won't let them go, then you would have just snuck out.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000 They would have never known where.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000 Yep.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000 And gotten in trouble when you rebelled against it.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000 Right.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Yeah.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000 That happens if your parents try to control you too much.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000 It's kind of like with any person, right?
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 You try to control them too much.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000 Then they get out of control.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000 They rebelling against you.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000 Right.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000 Which is a discussion I think I was having the other day with your daughter about people just trying to box people in.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000 And it's another example of over centralized command.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000 Yes, it is.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000 Too much.
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000 Too much stuff like that.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000 They're just going to go the other way.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 I was actually talking about this with a leader in a company.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000 I was just explaining because you like for sure money drives people compensation drives people.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000 But ability to choose your fate or have some influence over your fate is it also very powerful,
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000 motivator and incentive for people to follow.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000 So when you have a like if you have one job where you make more money,
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000 but you don't have any freedom, you don't have to control over your own fate.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000 Versus a job where you get paid last money, but you have really a lot of autonomy.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 Most people will go with your autonomy.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000 There are rare people that don't want any autonomy.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 They just pretty much want to get told, hey, give me my paycheck.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 I'll do whatever you tell me to do and that's fine.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000 And they're not into their job, but a lot of people,
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000 the more autonomy you give them, the more into it they are, the more they enjoy what they're doing.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000 Whereas if you're just micromanage them or centralized command scenario,
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000 they're not into it and that's a problem.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000 And at the first person you gave the example of probably exercises know what initiative whatsoever.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000 Exactly.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000 But you have to address that. You have to address that when the work with companies
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000 that there are people that they just want to get their paycheck.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000 They're going to punch the clock at 4.59 every day and that's the way it is.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000 They don't want to get promoted. They're fine with that.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000 And so you've got to know and you'll answer those people always is,
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 if you're leading someone like that, okay, you know what you've got,
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000 get the most out of them, take good care of them,
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000 and they'll do their job well and you know you can count on them for that.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000 So that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000 Just that somebody that does have higher goals or different goals,
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000 I guess where they want to break out of that,
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000 then you've got to give them the opportunity.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 And those people, if you box them in, they're going to rebel against you.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000 You've got to look out. They'll be like Jason Gardner, age 15 with a mohawk.
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000 Check, check.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000 So I don't want to the other things that you wanted to talk about a little bit
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000 was Scotty Words.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000 That's right. You know, and just coming after right after Memorial Day,
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000 it's really fitting to discuss him.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000 Scotty was a good friend of mine, just a fantastic team guy.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000 He did six years in the teams and then separated 2005 and he did what a lot of guys did at the time.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Was he started contracting overseas because he wanted to be at that point of friction.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000 And for Scotty, I don't think he was ever ever happier than when he was at that point of friction.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000 So he did a bunch of contracting.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000 He wound up getting hired by the Defense Intelligence Agency as a, as a GES position,
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000 a full-time position.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000 And then January, this last January, he was killed by a suicide bomber when he was out operating in Syria.
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000 And I remember when I got the text message, we were all in a group text that he passed.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000 And I just, man, it kind of floored me for a second.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000 But then, you know, it's like Scotty died doing what he loved.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000 And he was just such, he was a maniac in the best sense of the word.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000 Like the hardest I've ever laughed in my life is with him. And most people will tell you that any time they've had a good belly laugh or something,
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 he was whisked Scotty.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000 And he had that kind of contagious smile where you look at pictures and Seth is a lot like this one.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000 I look at Seth's pictures.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000 He's got that smile that just has that special thing about it that automatically makes you use smile.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000 You know, you are not ever going to be the voice or reason and you are always going to be a good time and you're a good friend.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:35.000 And so, while there's, there's a remorse that he's not here anymore, I'm so fired up that I got to spend the time with him that I did.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:46.000 And so anyway, I mean, there you really have it. He passed. He's from St. Louis, so they had a big funeral form there.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000 And it was at this Catholic cathedral. There had to be a thousand people inside that cathedral. And it was raining the day they had it.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:07.000 So the funeral possession from the cathedral to the military cemetery where they buried him had to be like at least 30 miles.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000 Every single overpass on the freeway on the drive there had fire trucks and first responders out on it.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000 The freeway, they shut the freeway down. Every exit was stopped by police officers, which is pretty pretty dang cool.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:41.000 So then when we got off the freeway and we were driving on the surface streets, people, the people as St. Louis just pulled their cars over and they were standing at attention out in the rain.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000 And so it's moving when someone in uniform does that, but you almost kind of expect that out of them.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:59.000 But when you see like a 30 year old mother of two and or two like eight year old kid in seven year old kid.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000 Standing at attention with their hands in the heart over their hearts in the rain and it was a cold rain.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000 As he went by, it's just.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:20.000 It's an amazing and humbling experience to see that kind of love and respect by the people of this country and the people of St. Louis.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Well, I was with with Chris Kyle's procession going down to where he was buried and that was a long drive.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000 I want to say it was a few hours.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000 And the entire thing and again it was raining same thing, we're in Texas, but it's raining and sure enough.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000 I mean there was people were lying the entire way and I was riding with one other guy and it was just and we were in this massive there was a massive procession of people.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000 But it was just I remember sitting there for a long time and just the windshield wipers just going back and forth.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:13.000 We were not talking because there's nothing to say you can't you can't put words to that you know you can't put words to thousands of people standing out in the rain with their hands on their hearts just every bridge fire trucks flags hung up from the ladders extended.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:24.000 Yeah, this the same same type of feeling that that I had when I was doing that and it definitely makes you realize that regardless of all the.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:38.000 What do they say these days that America is division all this division that everyone talks about there's plenty of people that that understand what it when it takes to keep this country free for sure.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000 Absolutely, I feel like it's such a small and maybe vocal minority.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:13:02.000 That's out there and I don't think it's on a whole I think we're we're on even though a lot of us have our differences and I think we're figuring out how to discuss politics just by looking at how people discuss stuff on social media and.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000 People were dialing it in and they're they're able to have.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000 Realistic discussions with each other without getting too hateful and there's some people that are still figure in that out.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000 For sure, I'll say two things about that I was on I was on Ben Shapiro's podcast.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000 Yeah, and you know Ben was like and Ben's a real nice guy he's you know very nice to me and and all that and he's you know he's.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000 What's pretty cool about him is he's he's like got this running list of everything that he said that's stupid or wrong or whatever he's me a culpa list.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000 But anyways, yes, we were having this conversation he was hinting at the fact of this massive division and you know these the massive right against the massive left and and you know I said listen man.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000 I travel the our whole country all the time I work with construction companies with finance companies with now you do too insurance companies.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:11.000 And we meet people from every different industry. I said these people aren't on the extreme right they're not on the extreme left their common sense their Americans and I said you Ben you're.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:25.000 You're like here at at ground zero for political like mayhem and so what do you expect to see like you're you're the you're the lightning rod for a lot of this stuff and so that's what you hear.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000 Normal America. It didn't really like that you know it's just not I'm out there all the time you're out there all the time now you know you see it no one's coming up to you saying.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:45.000 You know with some extreme views are there small number people share on both sides yes absolutely but in general people are realizing oh well that's not a bad point and then I was on.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:03.000 Brian Coppimon's podcast and we were talking about the same thing and what's interesting is you know Ben Shapiro's pretty pretty far on the right and and Brian Coppimon's pretty far on the left and me I think they're both really nice guys that are super cool and but what I said to him was.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:23.000 You know what what what you're saying what I believe is leading to the attitude kind of shifting is. Basically this. If you're not humble and you think you know everything then why should I listen to anything that you say you know why should if I'm on the far left why should I listen to anything I know everything and everyone on the right is wrong.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:47.000 If I'm on the far right why should I listen to anyone that anyone said anything that anyone saying on the other side I know everything. If you're humble and you say you know what I got some ideas but I'm probably not 100% right you know maybe I'm only 98% right no if you just look at other people and say oh you know what I probably don't have the full solution for this maybe I should listen to other people's opinions and try and try and come up with a.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:59.000 A more broad base idea than just what I think so I think people are starting to realize if you take one extreme view and you don't want anyone else than you're wrong.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:13.000 And so I think people are becoming a little bit more balanced I certainly hope I yeah and and I know that that I've got some really really close friends that are on both ends of the spectrum.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000 I'm going to go down with them and have a logical conversation with them I find out that our values.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:39.000 Yeah are the they're the same yeah and really it's just a lot of misrepresentation and some unfortunate semantics sometimes that you know drawn us to different directions or put us on different sides.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000 Speaking of the left hand and the right hand.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 Yeah.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000 This is you gotta tell the story about and this is this is a good revealing story about.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:01.000 I've I I'll lead to oftentimes the dark sense of humor in the teams and there's a dark sense of humor in the military and you kind of have to have a dark sense of humor.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:16.000 And I think did you see the movie range 15? No. Oh okay it's it's about it's just a crazy movie that Tim Kennedy and and Matt best and the black rifle coffee company.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000 Yeah, they all those guys.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000 They throw the keys to the girl.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Yeah, yeah, it's just it's just every horrible dark joke that you can make they make and I don't know how well it did or whatever it did good enough.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:39.000 I'm sure to fend a lot of people. I'm sure to fend it a lot of people but they they did it so good for good on him but.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000 You know you talk about that kind of dark sense of humor and I think this story which you like called me I don't know whatever it was six months ago or whatever you go.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:58.000 I got to tell you a story which whenever you call me and tell me that I get super excited I tell my kids to leave the room and I put you on speaker phone and I put you on speaker phone and then I mute.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000 So I don't but it's under interrupt you by laughing so hard because whenever you call me tell me got a good story I'm thinking here we go.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:15.000 So yeah tell us about the hand. So and and I talked to Aaron Kendall this morning to make sure I got the details correct.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:27.000 So Aaron Kendall's a seal that was working at the training detachment when I was the commander master chief there and he is on a hunting trip out in Texas like a foundation supported hunting trip.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000 And he's driving one of those side by sides out to where he's going to hunt like side by side at TV.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000 Yeah like an ATV try like one of those razors right and it rolls and it's smacked the roll bar smashes his left arm.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000 So he makes a turnic it out of his belt and walks like a mile back to the rainhouse and then they call the.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:03.000 They try to call life light life light can't come out to foggy they get an ambulance comes and get some they start driving them up towards to a hospital at San Antonio.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000 Now he's in the hospital they wind up having an apiotaid is left hand in the hospital.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000 In this first hospital. Why is that?
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:23.000 Because it was just completely. So smashed. Yeah, his arm was just smashed. It was done. He was losing so much blood through there and they they ended up like.
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000 They kind of had to fight to save the amputation below his elbow because they were worried that because later on in surgeries are taking more and more.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000 So there were a couple other team guys that were there and other team guys flew in to help out and they're staying at this hotel right outside the hospital where he's at.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000 So they take him from where he was they take him to this hospital. He's at this hospital and at that hospital they have to amputate his hand.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:57.000 So he's bedside talking with the other with some other seals and they're the surgeon who amputate his hand is in their checking on him and they asked the surgeon hey.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000 Do you guys still have his hand.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000 And the surgeon says yeah, I think so. I don't you know we haven't destroyed and they asked him what are you going to do with it and they goes well, you know, I guess they destroyed or whatever.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000 And so Aaron asks, what can I have my hand.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000 And the surgeon says.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000 I'll go check. So he goes and checks with the administrators right and they they come back and they say yeah, you get to fill out these forms, but we'll give you the hand.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000 So they fill out the forms. They give the hand to.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000 One of the other seals actually receives a hand because Aaron now has has had to move to a different hospital. That's a little bit better to deal with the applications.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000 And they've got his hand with the intent to take it to a taxidermist.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000 So in the meantime, they're keeping it in the the freezer of the hotel.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:05.000 And they're taking turns spending time with Aaron. So guy will be there at the hospital with Aaron while he's in the other hospital and other guys at the hotel and they're flipping back and forth.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000 Which is a little testament to like, well, the way it is for team guys are just looking out for him.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000 So you get here in the hospital, what's something to stay with you 24 hours and it's awesome.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000 Right. So one of the guys that's back at the hotel room.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:28.000 He's got to go somewhere and he wants to put the hand in the other guys freezer or he's going to play a joke on one of the other guys and put the hand in his bed.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000 And so he comes up with these different rooms to try and get the hotel staff to let him into the room and they're not having any of it because he looks kind of shady.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000 And he's a team guy.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000 So he's telling him, okay, you know my friend left his phone in the room and I get in there and they're like, well, no, or hey, well, no, actually wasn't his phone. It was his ID.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000 And I need to go like all that stuff.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000 That kind of shot in the balcony.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000 Let's check her criminal.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000 Yes. So then he leaves to go to the hospital, I guess.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000 But they're suspect.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000 They're suspect.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000 The poor maid goes in there and finds a hand in the freezer.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000 He did, I have a picture of it. It's horrible.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000 It's all gray and just like ripped off right there.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000 So Adams family style.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Yes.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000 And so they, of course, call the police.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000 The police show up and they just detain everybody.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000 Of course.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 Of course.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000 And then errands in the hospital and all the nurses come up.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000 And they're like, hey, all these police are calling here. They need to talk to you something about your hand.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000 So he's got to get on the phone and explain to the police why his hand is in the thing.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000 I think they probably validated something with the doctor too.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000 And you know, calm them down that this wasn't some kind of murder.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000 Yeah.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 And then they kind of settled everything.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000 They threw everybody out of the motel.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000 Aaron gave his hand to the taxidermist.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000 He had a nice, what they call European Mount were the taxidermist.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000 And Texas is awesome.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000 So they, they mounted like the skeleton hand is in this really cool,
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000 Mount inside glass all done up for him.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000 And Aaron just had, he had the best sense of humor about the whole thing.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000 You know, if you're going to get depressed, I mean,
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000 losing a limb is a pretty good way to do it.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000 You know, and a lot of ways, he's like, some of the stuff you see out of guys like, you know,
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 Travis Mills, where it's just funny.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000 You're not guys like that.
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000 You're not going to bum him out.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000 Just going to keep him going.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000 But yeah.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000 Yes, you're cool.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000 So then that's obviously one of, is like one of many stories.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000 How does that translate to like when you're dealing with your,
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000 with your family? Like so, for instance,
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000 my wife, when I went ahead to go to college, I had to go to the University of San Diego.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000 And so it's my first time in my adult life that I wasn't like in a poll tune.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000 And so I was, I, I didn't really think about it, but in all of a sudden,
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 I didn't have anyone to like attack verbally all day.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000 Because when you're a single-patoon, it's just constant, you know, attack and combat, verbal combat.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000 Sometimes physical combat.
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000 And so when I would come home from school, of course, there's my wife.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000 And I want to have some verbal sparring matches.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000 So I start hacking away after, you know.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000 And finally after three months, she goes, she goes, she goes, she goes, she's a,
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000 she says, hey, I'm not a teen guy, you know.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000 And when she said that to me, it instantly, I instantly realized exactly what she was talking about.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000 And I knew she was 100% right.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000 I can't treat my wife as if she's a E5 and a sealant.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000 And especially like the weapons cleaning table.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 When we're all stuck there cleaning weapons,
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000 when guys would just, that's when the youth look for weaknesses in any spot in any guy and just start pick, pick, pick, pick, and waitin' for the reaction.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000 Yeah.
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000 He spends so much time with people.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000 And so much time just waiting.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000 You know, it's a hurry up and wait thing.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000 So, oh, what are we going to do on a four-hour fan ride?
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000 No.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000 We're going to destroy someone, get into a fight,
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000 spill Cheetos everywhere, you know, just like total chaos and mayhem.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000 But yeah, it's all about that.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:27.000 But that, but I guess what I'm asking is, I know, you know, Iris obviously had to get what's the word indoctrinated into the life of beat.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 Because you know, I met my wife when I was pretty young.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 Yeah.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000 And you were not that young.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 No.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000 And so you, you know, you, how that work out?
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000 Well, the ideal wife, the, I don't say ideal, I don't know, I don't know, poor Iris listen to this, but the square to wait, let's say that, just square to wait, spouse.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000 You know what I'm saying?
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000 Was that look like it?
00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:01.000 So I got to go back to, if you look at my career and you know this, because you said this to her one is you on the podcast, like, she's the best thing that ever happened to me.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000 Oh, yeah.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000 She's completely squared away. And it's because she's so solid and independent.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000 And so there was never ever any aspect of me having to worry about the home front.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000 And there's a constant, she's like very dialed in and challenges me.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000 Like a lot of my, I had a lot of like pretty far right political views.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:47.000 And then when we sit down and have discussions and stuff, she's really open my aperture up on that, but you know, you look at her history where she, she worked on ranches where she was the only female Wrangler with a whole bunch of cowboys.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:59.000 So she, she got it. She had that aspect of what it's what it's like to be around and then a brown guy's and then when I'd be messing with her like that, you know, she just same deal is Helen.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000 Let me know.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000 Let's put you in check.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 Basically.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:14.000 Yeah. And the, you know, this, this job that we have where we're constantly going forward in harm's way.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000 And there, I chose my words kind of partly on the last podcast when I was talking about her.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000 I said that she put up with a lot of stuff that other women wouldn't.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000 And that, that gives the indication that she tolerated a lot of shenanigans negative.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:40.000 She was the strength that she had to have to be home while I was on combat deployments and then deal with me when I came back.
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000 That strength.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000 Most, most women just can't deal with that kind of lifestyle.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000 And don't have that kind of, what were the words that you used on the last podcast?
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000 She put up with a lot of stuff.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000 Yeah, I said, you know, yeah, yeah.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000 And so that, that was a really poor choice of words because it indicates like she was just a pushover and she is an absolutely not a pushover.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000 Yeah.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000 It, it's more, yeah, it's more like she had the strength to contend with the, the, the hard life that it is.
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000 Exactly.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Being married to some guy that's going on constant deployment and isn't around a lot.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000 And then when they're gone, by the way, they might die.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000 They might come back horribly wounded whatever and you sign up for that as well.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000 And she's working long hours and raising two little kids while I'm going on six month deployments.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000 Yeah.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000 And then she's she also, like, and, and I pretty much, I stayed in contact with, with her pretty often.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000 So we, we, we pretty much talked at least three times a week.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000 Three times a week on deployment.
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000 And, um, and that's the model it worked for us.
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000 I've described it and I forget who I described it to is emotional independence.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000 Like my wife had, has and had enough emotional independence that she was going to run the show.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000 If I'm not there, it's not freaking out, you know, and I think that's, if you're going to look for a, a good spouse, they got to be,
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000 you can't be, they can't be codependent, right?
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000 Co-dependent is actually actually like a bad thing, right?
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000 I mean, that's an, an actual bad thing, right?
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Co-dependency.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000 So yeah.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000 So, but if you go to the other end of the spectrum or not, maybe, I don't know, maybe there's, I guess we go too far on that spectrum.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 Then you get to where, hey, I don't even, oh, you're gone.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000 I didn't, I wasn't aware of that.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000 Sorry, I'm over here doing my own thing.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000 So you, but you got to find a good strong balance.
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Probably leaning towards independent in my opinion.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000 You got to be leaning towards independent.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Because if you're not leaning towards independent, I mean, when you don't get the, you know,
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000 it sucks being here by yourself for six months.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000 It's not a true partnership.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000 If, if, if they're not equal, right?
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000 If you're kind of not equal footing and one person really needs the other one,
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000 then then the partnership aspect of it is, it's not there.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000 Yeah, that's a, that's something to pay attention to.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000 Because the thing that's kind of weird is when your young guys get suckered into the being,
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000 it's, it feels all, empowering to have someone that's all dependent on you.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000 You're saying, oh, yeah.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000 When you're young and you got the girl and she's all dependent on you and the world revolves around you.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000 And then when you're not there, she's falling apart and you feel, oh, yeah, I'm the man.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000 And so it's easy, I think that I've seen that happen a lot where guys get suckered into those situations.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000 And that's not a good situation to get.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000 It never works out because they're like, who's, well, and then she's in a situation,
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000 if it's that kind of girl, she's going to find someone else to take care of her while you're not there to take care of her.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000 And then the case with Iris is like, we're inside the same box as far as,
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000 just the things that we enjoy where we want to be in the outdoors.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000 It's, it's all the same thing.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000 So, you know, it's like I said in my retirement ceremony when I look, look, I look at the trajectory of my career.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And then when Iris and I became together, I went from Platoon Chief to Master Chief first time up every time.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000 And just hammered it because she was a good partner and she drove me to be better.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000 And as always, drive me to be better.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000 It helps to have somebody that's super square the way like that.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000 You know what that does? It forces you like you're not there's doing it for yourself.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000 Because it's easy, sometimes easier to let yourself down, right?
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000 Yeah, it's easier to let yourself down, the no let down, this person that's looking at you thinking,
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000 hey, you could do better than that. Come on.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000 Are you serious right now?
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000 And that's the kind of stuff that you'll say to me.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000 You know, she's very straightforward and I'll be going, I'll just say, check.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Got it. And then we've gone to the point where we can give each other pretty honest feedback without
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000 there being any resentment involved.
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000 I've been pretty straightforward with Iris on some things.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000 We're working on some projects together.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000 Yep.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000 And it's pretty cool for me to be able to just be real straightforward with her.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000 And she's like, no, tell me.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000 Well, actually, no, how does she says it? She says, no go ahead and tell me.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Yep.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:39.000 Sheh, sheh. So, you know, speaking of Afghanistan, you're, you did the last time you were on.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 You know, we, we breeze through Afghanistan pretty quick.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:50.000 But that was actually a, a really, pretty big deployment in terms of what you guys did there.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000 Yep.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:01.000 And I know there were some details that you wanted to get into on some of those operations and some of the things that you brought home from those operations.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000 Lessons learned, et cetera.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000 I mean, you were talking about one earlier, talking about the modules and bringing them modules.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000 That's it. That's a, that's a good piece of gear to bring out on an operation.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.000 Yeah.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000 And usually you got a marked on mountain on top of a truck.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000 But, um, when we did that, that operation as Frago 6 and C.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Gengin, and we actually went into Marsha.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000 And the element that I was with was in a blocking position that was looking down a road that ran east west.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000 And we were the furthest east positions. So we're blocking position on, on that direction.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000 And where we got dropped off was really close to where we were going to stay for four days.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 So we were, you know, we brought a mortar in.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000 We brought the, the M2 HP, the heavy barrel 50 kelm machine gun with the big tripod for everything.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000 How do you break that up? How many guys have carried out?
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000 That's a lot of weight to carry man.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000 You touched about the M. UNISHING and the weapon and the tripod.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000 Well, ammunition got paired dropped into us, but the initial, the initial insert.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000 We had an ATV on the helicopter and a lot of that stuff was loaded on the ATV.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000 Plus we were inserted maybe 200 yards from the position.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000 Everything was kicked out of the hellow, staged.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000 We went and cleared the building and then hauled everything over there and set it up.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000 And we done all the, you know, the imagery set up for, okay, here's what we're going to be.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000 Here's where our firing lanes, all that stuff was pretty much set up ahead of time.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000 Once you guys were doing that, we started the guys and trade it.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000 Well, that we were putting through training started doing it started, Karen, man.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000 There was some big team guy.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000 Oh, he just got back from deployment.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000 He, I know exactly who he was talking to.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000 He was talking to the 50 cow like he looked like he was carrying a 60.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000 He did.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000 And it was a legit, good to watch.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000 His nickname was pigna.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000 His nickname was pigna.
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000 And he's a beast.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000 I know he's listening.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000 Good on you.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000 That's one of one of my favorite nicknames.
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000 You don't have some feature about you that gets noticed in the
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000 Dames, because everyone's going to call you by some weird name.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000 And the funny thing about him is he is super, he's a big guy and he's super intelligent.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000 Yeah, good.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000 Good guy.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000 Everywhere you measure it.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000 So we set this thing up in a window.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000 And, you know, inside, so just the barrel was sticking out and of, of the compound that we were holding.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.000 Aiming right down the east west road, because our biggest fear is a vehicle born ID coming down that road.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000 And along across that road, there was this, there was like a headrow and there was a little irrigation ditch over there.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000 And so the Taliban kept coming down that headrow and firing at us from the trees.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000 And then just put that 50 on the tree line, stitch it like at shin level, because that would be
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Chester a little bit high level for somebody in the ditch and just send a belt all the way down and back.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000 And then push them back further.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000 Well, at one point, some guys had come up from a different direction and they were getting really, really close in the tree line.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000 Bad guys.
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Bad guys.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And we could not traverse the gun over far enough.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 So we tried to shove it out the window.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000 It wouldn't go out the window.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000 So me and that EOD warn officer who is with us.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000 And then one of my E5s who right now he's a true BSEA over at one of the seal teams.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000 Check.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 Drug lifting out and put it in the street.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000 And just started laying it down. So we got the 50 cows set up in the street right out in front of our compound.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000 And for a second there, we were taking heavy fire.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000 Pretty heavy fire.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000 P.K. Ampfire, but it was all going a little bit high and we just kept stitching, stitching, and then they were done.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000 They broke contact.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000 They did not like that big gun.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000 In fact, the next day it kind of slowed down for us because they didn't want to come.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.000 They did. They're like, ah, we'll find a different direction because we were holding, you know, basically four square blocks.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000 So they started penetrating in from different directions.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000 The later on two days later, guys pushed out to another building.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000 That was about a hundred yards in front of the position.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:49.000 And they got into a little tick up there. So we started lighting up the area that we thought they were taking fire from.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.000 And the 50 cow was so loud that they thought that they were taking direct fire from the 50 cow when we were shooting.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000 So the rounds passing by that.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000 On the rounds passing by them, we're so loud and knocking dust off the wall.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000 That's how I was saying, I can't even imagine what it would be like to be in a building.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000 And you know, that one situation that Tony was in where the someone's lighting your building up with several hundred rounds.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000 Yeah, no, the blue on blue situation. Those guys put 150 rounds into 150 rounds of 50 cow from total.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000 I don't know, 20 meters away.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000 I mean, from the corner, it was a building on the corner and they stopped in the corner and just shot.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000 And those guys coming out of that building after we got thing under control.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 I mean, I kicked up on the door. I saw Tony there.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000 And then, but the and Tony looked pretty much just like normal Tony.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000 Yeah, everyone else in that building looked like they just saw death.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000 And they actually just did see death. I mean, they're in a building.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000 They get 150 rounds of 50 cow.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000 The guy that was on the roof, he was, he, he was telling me, he was telling me there's like a year ago.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000 Like we were just talking about and he goes, he goes, yeah, I got out my pistol.
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000 I, a hundred percent thought that we were going to get overrun and I was going to die.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000 If I didn't just take around through the concrete into my head.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000 Right.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000 Yeah.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 So did they know it was blue and blue?
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000 Or did they think that they were just getting hammered by the fire?
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000 No, it's just like, one of the, one of the, one of the many little, like, components of this.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000 So that guy, the guy that was on the roof top that I was talking to, 12 hours before.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000 He was in another position.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000 And he got lit up with a disco, a 12.7 millimeter, you know, weapon, which is the,
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000 so we had a equivalent of the 50 cow for those of you who don't know.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000 He got lit up with that and hit with RPGs.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000 So he said, I remember it, as soon as you know, as soon as this was all over, we got back to base.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000 That's another thing he told me, but he told me this way back then, he said, he said to himself,
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000 I can't believe the guy with the disco found me again.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000 He was so, and we were only, you know, a couple days before.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000 And that same guy, so when he got lit up here, he was in this, he was on camp
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000 and he was in an Overwatch position looking for ID in places.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000 He's sitting there on his sniper rifle.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000 And all of a sudden, he starts taking machine gunfire, and it's, it's a disco.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000 And then he gets hit with a couple RPGs.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Well, I'm inside with the company commander from, from one of the companies from the first to 506.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000 And we were planning an operation that we're doing the next day.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000 So we started hearing gunfire.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000 And all of a sudden we hear RPGs boom, boom.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000 And I said to, the machine gunfire starts,
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000 and he goes, oh, listen, I'm going to contact him.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000 And I go, hey, my sniper is up there. Don't worry about it.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Like just jacco the badass, right?
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000 Yes.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000 And all of a sudden boom, boom.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000 So we hear the RPGs say, so we go running outside.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000 And I'm still just, I say, hey, don't worry.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000 My guy's got this in, right as those words are coming out of my mouth.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000 Out of the bottom of the sniper tower,
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000 because we, we were right next to it.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000 Out of the bottom of the sniper tower, out pours that guy.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000 I'm sure we'll be on the podcast one day.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000 He comes pouring out of the tower.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000 His weapon, his sniper gun had been blown like the stock up blown off, bro.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000 I'd be RPG.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000 And he just looks like, oh my god.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000 You know what I said?
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Okay, well, maybe not.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000 It was horrible.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000 But so that's the guy when they're getting, when they're getting shot up with 50 cow.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000 Yeah.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000 He just thought, and the rest of the guys do,
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000 because everyone knew that this had happened, and we briefed it, hey,
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000 hey, just imagine the, the PLO going out to this,
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000 I'm saying, hey guys, these guys have
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000 Dishka 12.7 millimeter anti aircraft gun out there.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000 So be ready for some significant heavy weapons.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000 And sure enough, that's the guy on the rooftop thinking to himself,
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000 I can't believe this guy with a disco founding.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000 Yeah.
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000 Man.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000 And that was one of the big lessons learned
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000 when I got to trade at where guys would put 50 rounds of 50 cow
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000 into a building with planks, you know,
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000 simulating combat.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000 And then we'd have a trade at guy in there that would get up and shoot someone.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000 And they'd be like, that's bullshit.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000 Yeah.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000 You know what, guy, that would never happen.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000 And I'm like, oh, yes, it would happen.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000 You know, we had guys survive 25 millimeter chain gun
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000 from from Bradley's and still stumble out of,
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000 you know, not friendlies, right, not not for me,
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000 but we know there was an enemy that made it out of buildings
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000 that had whatever, however many rounds a bunch of 25 millimeter chain gun rounds
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000 coming out of the building or coming to your building and they'd still live.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000 So you don't know what's going to happen with bullets, you know?
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000 You just don't.
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000 No.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000 It's hard to tell.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000 And that, yeah, the frustration and the blame casting that goes on
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000 some of that training will get into that.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000 That way, but man, gosh, that 50 cow is such a bad ass weapon.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 Yeah.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000 And then, you know, later on, we had those things mounted on our trucks
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000 and the clearance of Mosul guys were stopping V-bids that are completely armored
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000 with those things just hammered on them.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 But then it's on a crow's remote system.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000 Mm-hmm.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000 And that's a number.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000 That's just a beautiful thing.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000 It's incredible that that gun was made in the early 1900s.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000 For sure.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000 Yeah, that's an incredible weapon.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000 You can use the exact same weapon today.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000 That's amazing.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000 That's a feet of engineering.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Someone was asking me when I posted pictures of all the brass all over the floor
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000 of that room on Instagram.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000 They're like, oh, did you have any jams?
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000 Oh, we know how to set our head space in timing.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000 Got the gauge right there on it.
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000 Boom.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000 That's an awesome weapon.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Now, another way, you know, we were telling me another one about getting
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000 extracted in like a, like a, like a Russian, like hip 17.
00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.000 So, we went into this operation in Zari Panjwe, which was a really, really hot area.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000 And we didn't like to drive anywhere because Afghanis stands limited, you know,
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000 it's limited roads. And so their IED threat was huge plus the recovered
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000 everywhere. So they would just pack all the, a culvert full of explosives and
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000 get blow up like, you know, two, uh, M-Rapz.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000 Okay, everybody.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000 That. And so we didn't have helicopter support for this one operation, but we were
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000 working with the DEA fast teams and they had their own hellow support and they had these
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000 N-Y-7 teams, which are these, you know, Russian helicopters, which are super, durable helicopters.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000 And, uh, contracted, you know, American pilots in them obviously.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000 Okay, that's cool.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 And, uh, so they had this operation and they were like, hey, you guys want to go
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000 on with us. So we, you know, we're, you know, we're the main force on that.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000 And it was during one of our turnover ops.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000 It was actually the op after the, uh, when Dan lost his leg, so we
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000 as late so we did not do.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000 And get dropped off first thing in the morning,
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000 go in clear to compounds,
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000 and we found a whole bunch of on that.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000 There were fields and fields of marijuana around here,
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000 and then on that operation,
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000 one of the compounds just had a whole bunch of hash.
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000 It was like, huge burlap sacks of hash,
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000 and I think they said there was 200 pounds of it.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000 That in the middle, they destroyed it.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000 And so it was the typical thing that happened.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000 Women and children left fighters came in,
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000 and then we were in, you know, a 360 firefight.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000 And we're in the firefight,
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000 and over the radio we're hearing from our aircraft overhead,
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000 they're saying, hey, there's a white van,
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000 and it's dropping fighters off around you.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000 So this white, this white minivan is driving off,
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000 picking up fighters, and then driving a big circle around us
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 and dropping off fighters.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000 So this is like an hour later, fireflies.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000 That thing?
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000 I did.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000 So just like a story.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000 So about an hour later,
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000 there's, they're like, hey, the white coming over,
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000 because I'm on dual com.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000 So I can hear it on the fires net,
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000 and that's like the other radio frequency outside of inner squad
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 coms for those of you who understand that is,
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 it's just one where the aircraft are talking,
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000 and one where we all talking, and I'm on both of them.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000 And I can hear the aircraft saying,
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000 that white van is back.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000 And so all of a sudden,
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000 I'm looking straight north at 200 yards,
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000 and I see a white van pulling to the open,
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000 and stop in, you know, in an alleyway.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000 So, get on the radio.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 Where's that white van?
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000 And is it directly north of our position?
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000 And the aircraft comes back.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000 Yeah, I just dropped off two guys,
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000 and they're stopped. They're looking at you right now.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000 Crack, crack, crack.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000 Two rounds, and then a 60 gunner just mows the thing down,
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000 and they're just done.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000 Through.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000 Well, firefight just kept going.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Now, the MI-17s, they can't fly after dark.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000 They didn't have some kind of certification.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000 So, they had to come in there and do a hot extract
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000 on that LZ to get us off.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000 So, there's bullets flying all over the place.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000 We get stacked to set our breakout.
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000 So, everyone's kind of broken down from their position.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000 We slubs the security.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000 They're setting up the LZ.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000 And then my job as the senior,
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000 what's the gun on my aircraft,
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000 was I run out, I'm the first guy to the aircraft,
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 and I count guys getting on,
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000 and on the last guy on that aircraft.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000 So, that aircraft isn't going until I have whatever number of people
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000 getting on it, getting on it.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Everybody's piling on there.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000 I got a flag on them.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000 I got a flag count, and there's no seats for me.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000 So, I got a hop on the ramp,
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000 and hook an arm through one of the guys' legs.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000 My feet are dangling off the ramp as we take off.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000 And then I'm shooting just half-ass from the hip
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000 because it's cool.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000 Just for the call.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000 Just for the call, the apocalypse and alcohol.
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000 At a place we were taking fire from as we took off.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000 And then we got out of there.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000 It was a lot fun.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000 I'm going to stop sure to say,
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000 and it's awesome because I'm not going to use that word anymore.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000 But it was pretty dang great.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.000 Great.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000 That's what we're doing.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000 That's what we're doing.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000 It was.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000 And no one got hurt, no one got wounded.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000 No, in that one.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 No.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Amazing.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000 But you said, are these bullets or flying around?
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000 And it's just incredible because...
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 Just the laws of chance.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000 Yeah.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Well, those aircraft too.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000 You know, it's like...
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000 Those old school aircraft.
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000 Like when you read about the Vietnam guys,
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000 and I'm reading a book right now,
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000 those aircraft...
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000 They were flying these...
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000 They were...
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000 They had Vietnamese pilots in these king-be aircrafts.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000 And those things...
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000 The guy came back from one of them.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000 They had 48 holes in it.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000 And shot 48 times.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 Yeah.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000 And this American SF guys looking at the aircraft.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000 And...
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000 He's looking at the pilot.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000 He's getting in like you are.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000 And he gets in.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000 And he leaves looking at this Vietnamese pilot.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000 And the Vietnamese pilot looks cool.
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000 He's just like Roger.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.000 And I got...
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 It's a great quote.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000 The guy says something along the lines of...
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000 When I'm flying, I'm just thinking about flying.
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000 I'm not thinking about bad guys.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000 I'm not thinking about bullets.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000 I'm just flying my aircraft.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000 If it's my day, it's my day.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000 Period in the story.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000 But that...
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000 Coming in a hot-extra-clank like that, that's...
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000 Getsch.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000 And those guys...
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000 They...
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000 They come in super fast and superless speeds...
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000 Speeds on their side.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000 And it is sketchy.
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000 It's...
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000 I was in a random rush.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000 And they are...
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000 I have a helicopter...
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000 A hip...
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000 Or what are you...
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000 Am I 17?
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000 Yeah.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.000 The...
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000 The NATO term is like a hip.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000 But yeah, it was an Africa working.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000 And...
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000 And that's like...
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 We need to get somewhere.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 And the only thing they could get us was...
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000 We've contracted helicopters.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000 But it was...
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000 But it was contracted pilots too.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000 And I was happy to land on that one.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000 Because...
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 Those are pretty common side over there.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000 And they've been a stand-a-stand a lot of the other...
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000 Other agencies were using those.
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000 And somebody had told me...
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000 And I don't know if this is true or not...
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000 That they were...
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000 They were so inexpensive.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000 It wasn't worth doing the maintenance on them.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000 So when they got to a maintenance schedule,
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000 they just destroyed it and buy another one.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000 That's crazy.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000 Yeah.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000 And...
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000 And I don't know if that's true.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000 You know, that's something I heard from some guy over at the Chow Hall...
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 Yeah.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 Who was well informed apparently.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000 But those pilots were so...
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 So good.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000 And they were all probably XTF-160 guys that were now hired on by...
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000 These other guys that do the job over there.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000 I was incredible.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000 So speaking of wounded...
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000 Or that kid's not wounded, but you were telling me a story about...
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000 And I cut you off so you didn't tell it to me.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000 But you're telling me a story about a Taliban guy getting shot in the leg.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000 Yeah.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000 So last time I was telling you the story about...
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000 Last time I was telling you the story about the...
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000 The operation where we'd set pop flares out...
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000 Because guys were able to get so close to us.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000 And during that firefight, one of our firing positions up on a roof...
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000 They're like, hey, there was...
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000 There was someone that had circled around kind of behind our position...
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 And we weren't taking any fire for them.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 They were in... in the process of trying to flank us.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000 They're like, hey, there's a guy back here and we just shot him.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000 We killed him.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000 So stuff calmed down.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000 And I talked to the team commander.
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000 I'm like, hey, I'm gonna press out with these two guys...
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000 Because it appeared as if it was like right around the corner...
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Around this wall.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000 And we're gonna go see if the guy's got a radio on him or anything like that.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000 So we push out of the compound and we loop around a wall...
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000 But it's not just one wall at several walls and we get a little bit farther away.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000 So we round the corner where the guy's supposed to be.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000 And there's no dead guy at all.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000 But there's a guy standing 30 yards away on a hill and he's shooting at me.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:35.000 So I have got... I'm patrolling my scar heavy, but I folded the buttstock like a dummy.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000 And because I thought that was a cool way to patrol.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000 And so now...
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000 I'm like, oh no, I can't shoulder my scar.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000 So I just tried to lock it out on the ground.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000 Like we do at the MB5Ks.
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000 Yes.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000 I lost a punch it out.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000 You just punched it out.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 Squeeze the atom.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000 And then it had a stove pipe and a feed jam.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000 So I just took a knee and started to reload and then cleared the jam real quick.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000 Start shooting me again.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000 But he was gone.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000 And then he turned up again when we went to do our extract.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000 The following day we had to clear a couple buildings near where the helos were going to land.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000 And then we found that same guy with his leg all bandaged up.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000 Because they didn't kill him.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000 They just shot him in the way.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000 And then we just wound up, you know, leaving him there.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000 So was that the last time you patrol the New Scar heavy with the stockful?
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000 Yeah.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000 And then, you know, on another op, I learned the lesson I've never taken off my body arm and helmet because it was hot.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000 Yeah.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000 Yeah.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000 What happened on that one?
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 Oh my goodness.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.000 So we were, um, it was an operation swally caught where we'd taken high ground above a couple of compounds that we'd cleared.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:13.000 And the next day, the talent, we'd gotten to the point right where we'd started to get a little bit complacent.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000 And all our engagements with the Taliban, we'd always had the upper hand against them.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000 We'd, uh, completely, we had air power.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000 We had better weapons.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000 We were trained better.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000 Yeah.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000 And on this operation, we had a piece of high ground right behind the compounds that we took.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000 What was everyone wearing was everyone using the eight cogs on their, on their scarves generally or what were they using?
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Guys, variety of a cogs, the snipers actually took the scopes off their SR25s and put them on the, uh, the scopes.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000 So everyone had basically everyone had scopes and so lots of them.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000 And we had 300 windmacks and I brought it along on this.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000 I'm just thinking mentally from the viewpoint of where the enemies at, like you're reaching out and touching them accurately way further than they can get you pretty much.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000 Which, which again, leans towards you thinking to yourself, we're going to kick these guys ass every time.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000 Yep.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000 And then you did kick the ass a bunch of times.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000 And, and so then these guys start to take a high ground all around our positions.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000 And we can see a guy pushing out with a pkm onto this flat ledgerock.
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000 He's 1100 yards away.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000 And we're shooting at him with a 300 windmack.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000 What it's windy.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000 And we're missing, we're missing close and he'd go back and then come back out, go back, come back out.
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000 And they were getting set up all around us and then they just brought it.
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.000 They let us go with a salvo of rocket propelled grenade grenades and then just steady pkm fire.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000 And we thought there are 1,000 yards out.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000 They really can't do that much.
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000 Oh, it's, you know 105 degrees out.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000 So we'll take our body armor and helmets off.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000 And then that did just laid the hammer down.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000 Luckily for me, I happened to be right on top of my body armor.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000 And because I was in the, in the prone position.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000 And then I just was able to snake into my body armor and get my helmet back on my head.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000 And, you know, in this, this is a position where this is the first time we'd been somewhere.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000 We couldn't fill sandbags.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000 So we just stacked a bunch of rocks.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000 It, as best we could to make a fighting position.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000 And the bullets were just steadily hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks and hammering the rocks.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000 And I was thinking, man alive.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 I'm, I'm going to get shot.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000 And I'm, I wonder if it's going to hurt, but it's definitely going to happen.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000 The odds are, odds are there.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000 And somehow I didn't.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000 And then then the B, up B1 bomber came on station and dropped a whole bunch of ordinance and laid the hammer down.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000 But after that.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000 And I ran out of water.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000 We all ran out of water up in this underground position.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000 It was like 112, 14 degrees at 2 in the afternoon.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000 We ran underwater and there was no getting any water until that night when the sun went down.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000 Did you listen to podcast with Ron Shuron?
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000 I'm sure I did it.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000 Yeah, the SF guy, Medal of Honor recipient.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000 But if you go watch the videos.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000 Oh, that, yeah.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000 Yeah, that, like, the castle that they're attacking.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000 That's crazy.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000 It's just straight uphill.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000 I was just, I couldn't believe that.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000 When I, as I was reading, like, I was reading a bunch of articles about the situation.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000 Yeah.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000 And then they kept talking about video and I said,
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000 I'll check out YouTube.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000 And I saw it back.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000 I couldn't believe it.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000 I couldn't believe it.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 And the way he described it, it was just incredible.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000 Yeah.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000 He just laid it out there.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000 He's like, oh, yeah.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 Yeah.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000 He's so understated.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000 He's like, well, you know, it was a little bit of a hill.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000 Yeah.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000 He's a pretty big building.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000 I was like, oh, it was a cliff.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000 And it was a castle of talking to the cliff.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Oh, well, it was a pretty good awesome guy.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000 You know, another thing that we were talking about.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000 And you made, obviously, this is a good,
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000 leave an Afghanistan.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000 But it's getting back early in your career when you were,
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000 when you failed the stalking section of Sniperschool.
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000 And then you went back and you, and you, you know,
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000 you obviously made it through you past the stalking section.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000 And you kind of touched on it when you were on last night.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000 But I was wondering, like, a little bit more granularity on what you changed
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000 that you went from failing the stalks to, all right,
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000 here's me knocking out whatever it is.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000 Yeah.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000 And it comes down to basically doing what I've been taught.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000 And, and, and, and people were telling me is that
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000 you start the stalk.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000 You're told to find the OP, which is, you know,
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000 1200 yards away.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000 And the first thing you've got to do is figure out where that OP,
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000 an OP is an observation point.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000 And that's where the guys that are grading you on the stalk
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000 who are other Sniper instructors, that's where they're at.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000 And you, you take that, this model.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000 And I always just thinking how it applies to problem solving
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000 basically across the board, where,
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000 okay, I need to find a goal in my future here somewhere.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000 In this case, it's the stalk.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:25.000 And then, before I start executing on moving toward that,
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000 that goal, going to find that OP,
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000 I need to take some time and study the terrain and see what my,
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000 you know, line of attack is going to be and how I'm going to move
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000 all the way up to where I'm going to go.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000 And then I need to put it into action.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000 And while I'm putting an action, I'm constantly reassessing that goal
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000 and adjusting my actions across the way.
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000 And that, when I went from that model,
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000 I went from, you know, failing stalks to being the first one done,
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000 hardly spending any time on my belly and doing that.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000 So, then you take that and you apply it to life.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000 And you think about just goal setting, where do I want to be in five,
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000 in five years?
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000 And identify it and then say, okay, do a little research.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000 How do I get there?
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000 And then get on that damn path, stay disciplined,
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000 and then just keep the eye on the target and keep adjusting your aim as you go.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000 And I can look back at times in my life where,
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000 really, I wasn't paying attention.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000 I'm really just treading water, you know,
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000 living paycheck to paycheck, doing whatever.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000 And now, you know, I take that model and I apply it to,
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000 where do I want to be in five years?
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000 Where do I want my kids to be?
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000 What kind of parent do I want to be?
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000 And how am I going to get there?
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000 And what's the path I'm going to lay out for it?
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000 Yeah, and it's from a leadership perspective, obviously, this applies.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000 Because from a leadership perspective,
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000 if you, and I was just on Peter T as podcast,
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000 and we were talking about a little bit about that.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000 Strategic framework tactical, right?
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000 Yeah, and you have to stand in it.
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000 And, you know, what I've said to him,
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000 where it first started to occur to me,
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000 that was, hey, if my guys don't know what it is that we're trying to accomplish,
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000 they can't make it.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000 They can't, they can't move.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000 Sure, I can tell move eight yards forward,
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000 and then they can't hear me anymore.
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000 Now, what they're going to wait for me to get whatever they are.
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000 I can say, go take that building right there.
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000 Well, now they can't hear me anymore.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000 So now what they're going to do?
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000 They're going to sit there and wait for me to come up and tell them,
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000 do something else?
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000 No, they need to know what we're trying to get accomplished.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000 And then they need to have this standard operating procedure
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000 down well enough so they can, and the parameters that they're allowed
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000 to maneuver within, and that allows us to actually accomplish the mission.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000 And that's something, I think I, I mean, I don't even know
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000 when I learn that, but without that strategic objective,
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000 and that's a strong word, okay?
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000 I get strategic, I get what it means,
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000 and I'm not talking about, you know, global warfare,
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000 but when you're in a town,
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000 and you have a mission objective that, okay,
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000 we're going to get to this building, or we're going to move to this area,
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000 we're going to take this piece of terrain, and everybody knows that.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000 And even when those things change, because as you know,
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000 you get into a contact or you get into a situation where you change
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000 what you're doing, you have to let everyone know that,
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000 hey, we're breaking contact, we're getting out of here,
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000 hey, we're going to strongpoint this building or whatever.
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000 Once everybody knows that, then they can act on it,
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000 then they can carry it out, same thing that,
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000 well, what you're talking about there, now I want a bigger picture,
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000 of course, until it applies on a bigger picture,
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000 if your troops in the field don't know what it is you're trying to achieve,
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000 then they make bad decisions.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000 If they don't know that you're trying to protect the populace,
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000 if they don't know that that's the broad strategy,
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000 then they get out there and treat the populace, they lack like idiots.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000 If they know that's what they're trying to do, then they make better decisions,
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000 because they don't, but they'll make better decisions,
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000 because they understand what that broad strategy is,
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000 and it's certainly the same thing in business,
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000 and with business it goes back and forth too,
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000 because business, sometimes in business,
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000 you're, you know, I run into it with businesses where they're,
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000 for instance, trying to go public,
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000 so they need to make money every quarter,
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000 they need to show that profitability increase,
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000 and so the biggest thing they got on their mind
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000 is trying to show a good quarter,
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000 and they'll sacrifice some strategic things like,
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000 the sacrifice a little bit of taking care of their customer,
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000 because they want to scrape a little money out of it out of the situation,
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000 that's a bad strategic play, but they do it short-term at the time,
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000 because they know they gotta make money the quarters,
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000 they can come back and read less more.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000 So, but everybody's gotta know that,
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000 because if everyone thinks, hey,
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000 hey, the number one thing is we never let our customers out,
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000 okay, guess what, we lost money this quarter,
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000 now we can't go public, because we,
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000 and again, this is a really kind of garden level examples,
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000 but that's the kind of thing where what you're talking about
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000 if people don't understand what that longer term goal is,
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000 then they can't really operate and function on their own,
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000 which is a problem.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000 No, and you're not thinking long-term,
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000 you're just thinking day to day, basically.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000 Yeah, I kind of went off at the master on that one kid
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000 that asked me, how often are you thinking strategically
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000 and how often are you thinking tactically?
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000 And, you know, I just kind of was going off about,
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000 look man, every single thing I do is strategic.
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000 I'm making any tactical moves.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000 I'm not worried about the tactical wins and losses.
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000 Now, there's a reason for that.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000 I'm going to good spot right now where a little tactical loss
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000 doesn't mean that much to me right now,
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000 and it's really easy for me to just focus on the strategic stuff.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000 You know, when I was younger, I had to focus more on some tactical things,
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000 you know, that's the way it is.
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000 But even as a young person, you gotta keep that strict.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000 You know, you might have to take some tactical,
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000 you might have to make some adjustments and win some short-term battles,
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000 just because that's the way it is,
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000 you should be thinking tactics all the time.
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000 Or, start you should be thinking strategy all the time.
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000 You should be thinking long game all the time.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000 All the time thinking about the long game.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000 All the time thinking about how is this decision affect
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000 where I'm going to be in the long-term,
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000 because the short-term decisions,
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000 those are the ones that beat you down.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000 Yeah, absolutely not.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000 I'm not going to be that long-day.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000 Nested inside that long-term strategy.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000 Yeah.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000 Yeah. I actually kind of appreciated that he brought that up.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000 Yeah, he was a good question.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000 He was a younger guy.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000 And you could see he's thinking, you know,
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000 he probably thought to himself,
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000 hey, it seems like Jockel keeps talking about the long game.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000 And he thought to himself how often is Jockel thinking about that?
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000 And so he asked the question, good on him.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000 So I could explain, I'm thinking about it all the time.
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000 I'm thinking about all the time.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000 That's the way you gotta do it.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000 And Peter and Tia as well,
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000 for bringing that,
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000 the whole framework,
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000 the bring and the whole framework and everything up.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, for that aspect of that.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000 Yeah, because I was listening to that in this morning.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000 I'm like, yeah, this lays.
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000 That's the same thing that makes you successful on a stock,
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000 choosing that goal and then working your way to it,
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000 doing your, you know,
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000 and you gotta watch out for the situation
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000 where you get paralysis by analysis or
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000 and that's caught up by that you got a time limit on a stock.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000 Okay, you got three hours to get this done.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000 So you gotta get it figured out and you gotta get moving.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000 Or I think a lot of people will fall into that trap
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000 where the due to much study,
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000 too much study.
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000 And then there are no actual life in life in general.
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000 And in stocks, guys,
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000 will run out of time.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000 I said something the other day.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000 Most things don't get finished because most things don't get started.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000 I think people even even start building,
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000 make that move.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000 Right.
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000 Of course, hey, guess what,
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000 big chocolate is an dichotomy.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000 And that's the bottom line.
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000 If you rush into it and you start moving without having
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000 a long-term plan, you're probably going to make it a bad move.
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000 If you take too long, you're going to wait too long
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000 and the whole room is going to pass you by.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000 Yep.
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000 So you have to constantly modulate and figure out where you're at.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000 And no one's going to be able to give you the answer.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000 I can't sit here and be like,
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000 oh, you know what you're going to do right there?
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000 You want to make this, no.
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000 No one's going to be sitting there telling you that day by day.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000 You've got to figure that out.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000 And you've got to figure out if it's really,
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000 really moving you in the right direction.
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000 Yep.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000 Wait, it's got to be.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000 When you were talking about coming back to trade at,
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000 and you know, you and I both had the,
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000 the luck to be at trade at in the positions we were in.
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000 I was the, I was the trade at OIC.
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000 You were the trade at CMC.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000 So basically we were the senior dudes.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000 We weren't together unfortunately.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000 But what a good job.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000 And what a good opportunity to see how things unfold.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000 And what a good opportunity to take these standard operating procedures
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000 and pressure test them.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000 You exactly.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000 So I was, I was hit up the other day in a brief where I was talking about,
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000 when I was there as a true PSEA,
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000 and we did our first FTX,
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000 and you had just trained, changed training to where we,
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000 but prior to that, and every time I'd been through Land Warfare,
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000 prior to coming through as, as the troops senior and listed advisor in 2008,
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000 our FTX is where all live fire.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000 Great.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000 Live fire school, but it's so canned.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000 Yep.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000 Because it has to be for safety,
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000 that it really doesn't put any pressure on the leadership,
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000 and there's not really any pressure,
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000 brought to bear on any of your SOPs.
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000 Yeah.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000 Simply, everyone, when you're in a gunfight,
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000 there's two horrible things that the enemy will do.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000 They will shoot at you, and they will maneuver.
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000 And when you're using live fire for training,
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000 your enemy is a bunch of paper targets.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000 At best, they're mounted on those little cards that can move around,
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000 but they're very, very limited, not even remotely close to what a human being is going to do.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000 So when you're going with live fire,
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000 your enemy neither shoots back at you,
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000 nor do they maneuver.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000 So in the sealed teams, we would destroy our paper targets all the time.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000 We would crush them all the time, relentlessly.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000 We would outmaneuver them because they couldn't move.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000 We would outshute them because they didn't shoot.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000 So it was pretty easy to dominate.
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000 And sure, there was that level of stress of the fact that it is live fire.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000 And when you're out like in the desert,
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000 you are, and you do do, and we still do this,
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000 where you have to shift fire, and you're walking,
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000 and you're making sure that you're safe,
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000 because you can't, you can you can shoot each other.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000 But that type of stress compared to the stress of,
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000 okay, now the enemy, we're using laser tag guns or paintball,
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000 and the enemy isn't full on maneuvering.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000 They're full on shooting back at us.
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000 That's a big step up.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000 Yeah, and so we just completely,
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000 epically failed that first operation.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000 And we took the hard look at the four biggest things we did wrong
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000 and identified where our standard operating procedures were flawed.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000 And then we sat down with our leadership,
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000 and we got input and started to modify those SOPs.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000 So we could build up standard operating procedures
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000 that were resilient enough to withstand all the pressure
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000 that you guys were putting on us in training.
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000 And someone asked me, at us,
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000 a keynote I was given the other day,
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000 like, well, didn't you guys have SOPs prior to that?
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000 And we absolutely did, but they weren't good enough
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000 because they couldn't withstand the pressure.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000 So they had to be modified.
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000 We had to modify the way we were doing SOPs
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000 for getting ahead counts.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000 We had to modify how we were dealing with our downmen.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000 Like, honestly, we weren't carrying letters around.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000 We weren't, but it's just an absolute abject disaster.
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000 If you get a wounded guy sure,
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000 I can drag him off the X.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000 But now if I patch him up and I got to throw him over my shoulder again,
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000 I'm going to blow out every bandage I just put on him.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000 That's stupid.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000 You know, our radio comms going when everything is confusing.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000 We had to fix that.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000 So we had to dial those SOPs in.
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000 The standard operating procedures.
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.000 And the beauty of trade-at is that as stuff is happening on the battlefield,
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000 we immediately modify that in the training.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000 And we're putting that on top of the guys in training.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000 So they can see if they're standard operating procedures are good to go
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000 or if they're flawed and they need to be modified.
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000 So we can constantly modify if people are honest about them.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000 Yeah.
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000 And that's the beauty of the, the basically, the Petri dish or the lab that we had
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000 out there at trade-at because the other thing is we could see when when people were being honest
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000 about their mistakes or when guys were were blame-casting and not taking ownership of what was going on
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000 and not being honest with their SOPs.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000 And then you just develop these SOPs.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000 Like they don't just apply to the battlefield.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000 We came up with standard operating procedures for, you know, how we did our admin stuff,
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000 how we dealt with with anything that you can think of.
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000 We would think of a good way to do it and then test it and then run through it.
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000 So, you know, you might not like this, this analogy, but I think that SOPs kind of are a life hack
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000 because is one of those things that you can lay there is no work.
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000 I know, except for the standard operating procedure is pretty dang close to one.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000 Yeah, you know what's, as you were talking about that, one thing that I definitely noticed is
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.000 the, you could have almost 90% of the time that you used the word modify our SOP.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:11.000 You could have used the word simplify because most of the time it was someone saying, hey, we got this crazy.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000 This is what we're going to do. We're going to do this and you're going to do that and it is all these crazy things.
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000 And they realize that doesn't work. So you make it simpler and simpler.
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000 Now, where that's counterintuitive is like in extreme ownership where I talked about doing SSC.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000 And when we first started doing SSC, the plan was real simple.
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000 Just smash everything and just take whatever you'd find, right?
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000 That was a horrible plan and it didn't work.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000 So we had to, we had to put something that was a little bit more looked on the surface to be a little bit more complex.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000 Even though when you broke down the individual human beings and what they were doing, it was a very straightforward and very simple.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:50.000 So, so yeah, yeah, I know there's no doubt that having that opportunity to watch SOPs get tested and either pass or fail.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000 And it was still obvious either away because it was so cool when the platoon and the taskings would start to work together.
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000 And they'd start to cover move for each other and they'd start to use decentralized command.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000 They would crush the trade act guys.
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000 Or they would at least get the best of them.
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000 They'd at least kill them all.
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000 Whereas when they're not doing it, it would be comical.
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000 Four trade act guys would kill 40 guys or whatever it was.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000 Then you'd just be thinking, hmm.
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000 And you're right, this is where you'd have ego problems would show up.
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000 Because guys would think, and it was so hard from my perspective when you're like, listen.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000 The trade act cadre is going to do the same thing to the last nine troops or the last five troops.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000 They did this exact same scenario.
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000 And the other troops used simple standard operating procedures.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000 They covered a move.
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000 They used decentralized command and they won.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000 Here's what you're doing.
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000 This is from my perspective and I know it's hard.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000 But what you're doing is you're trying to control everyone or what you're doing is you've got these standard operating procedures that are too complicated.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000 You're not prioritizing an X-Cuner. You're just, you've got to follow these simple rules.
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000 And it would be hard to convey to some guys if the guys wanted to put up their ego barrier and let it offend them and think,
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000 No, never happen or no, that's just the trade act guys knew what we were going to do.
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000 Yeah, the trade act guys know what you're going to do.
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000 You know what? You're attacking a target area.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000 Anyone any, any military mind in the world is going to get the high ground.
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000 And then they're going to sweep through if they can from high ground to low ground.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000 That's what everyone's going to do.
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000 It's not like the trade act guys, the anybody could figure that out.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000 Any, any military mind is going to look at a target and do it one of three ways or one of four ways.
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000 And 50% of those four ways actually is going to overlap.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000 So you don't have to be a frequent rocket science or a scientist or or or or or Napoleon to be able to figure out,
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000 Okay, here's the target.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000 Where do I think the seals are going to come in from?
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000 It's like, oh, okay, they're probably going to come in from here.
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000 I'll set up two guys there.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000 There's also a chance they're going to come in from over here.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000 Go, I'll put two guys over there.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000 There you go.
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000 We knew you knew our plan.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000 It's like, yeah, bro.
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000 The enemy is, it's like you talked about you had situations where you went in and you're like,
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000 Oh, we'll go get on the high ground.
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000 Oh, the, the enemy put IED's there.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000 Yeah, guess what?
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000 It doesn't take a rocket science to figure out.
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000 Oh, if you're going to assault us here,
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000 you're probably going to want to get this piece of this piece of terrain over here.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000 So that would offend guys and they'd get into the, hey, this is this is wrong.
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000 And instead of saying, okay, what did I do wrong?
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000 Can you just, can you just tell me what I did wrong again?
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000 Because I need, I'm not sure I understand it.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000 Oh, well, what you did is this.
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000 You didn't prioritize next to you.
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000 You didn't use decentralized command.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000 And they would just, if you're not going to listen to that,
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000 you know, it's a problem.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 I had a guy at the master just asking me about like,
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000 how do you handle it when someone really picks you apart
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000 on a debrief?
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000 And I flag, bro.
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000 And I, and that, I, what I do is I look them rightly,
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000 and I say, thank you.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000 Thank you for telling me that, please, thank you.
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000 And, and I appreciate it.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000 And I'm going to go look at what you just told me.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000 And I'm going to try and figure out if I can fix it.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000 Because otherwise, like you, you just, I could see in this guy's eyes.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000 Like he's asking me that question because his ego is getting offended.
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000 I, and everyone's ego gets offended.
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000 Mine gets offended when somebody tells me that.
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000 When somebody gives me the nine big debrief points on what I did wrong,
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000 I'm freaking mad.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000 I don't want to make mistakes.
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000 I even ego just like everyone else.
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000 If not a freaking larger ego than anyone else.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000 And when somebody tells me I did nine things wrong,
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000 I'm pissed, I'm pissed at myself.
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000 And it's really easy for me to look at you and get pissed to you
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000 for telling me that I screwed this up.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000 But instead, I've gotten old enough to realize,
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000 even if I don't like you, it's even harder if I don't like you.
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000 It's even harder.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000 When I don't like you, it's even harder, right?
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000 That's what makes it super hard.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000 But when you go, you know what?
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000 You bite down and you go, okay, thank you.
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000 Let me assess what you just told me.
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000 If you could make that little step up in your life,
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000 it's epic.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000 And when guys want to your point,
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000 when guys wouldn't make that step in that step up
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000 in coming through the trade at training,
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000 it would be a nightmare.
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000 It was a nightmare.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000 And the thing is man, like, I love all these team guys.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000 I want them to go kick ass.
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000 That's all I wanted was to go do great things on the planet.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000 And when you get that, the guy coming through
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000 that just would be offended by it.
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000 And I'd be so bummed out.
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000 I'd be so bummed out.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000 I'd be like, bro, I'd just want you to do good.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000 I'm just telling you, like, don't focus on a head count
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000 when you're in the firefight.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000 That's what I'm saying.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000 Yeah.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000 And then you get to the point where
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000 you're just like, oh man, you're not going to get it.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000 Now I'm just going to make you suffer.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000 Yeah.
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000 But because you'll get critique points where guys will say,
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000 hey, we need to get an op so we can go start to finish
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000 where you let us win basically.
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000 And you know, if you're playing football
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000 and your college team goes against a high school team,
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000 that's not challenging for anybody,
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000 and you're not going to really learn anything out of it.
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000 And that's why I gave you a walk through.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000 And so after seeing that so many times and running land
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000 warfare, I started going out at the front day one
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000 and saying, hey, guys, listen, you're going to get a walk through.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000 That's your time to work through your whole script
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000 on how you're going to run a target assault.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000 But I'm short-changing you if I'm not putting pressure on you
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000 when we have these FTX nights because we only have this place for a limit
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000 period of time and this is where you're going to find where your weak points are
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000 and get better.
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000 And then knowing about myself when I have those two voices,
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000 arguing in my head, the one that's my ego
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000 and it's making an excuse for everything that someone is who's debriefing me
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000 is picking apart and the other reasonable voice,
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000 which I'm trying to turn the volume up on,
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000 that's going, oh yeah, that's a fair critique.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000 Yeah, well, I got a little lazy there, shouldn't have taken my body
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:18.000 armor off of that kind of stuff or the worst was like the OIC
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000 that would come out after you were OIC.
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000 If he came out to training and he would find some stuff that was screwed up
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000 and he's like, why am I the one fixing it?
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000 And I'm like, you are exactly right.
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000 And guys are good angry, he's like, you come out here and you call this out.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000 He goes, we deserve it.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000 Let's not do this ever again.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000 We cannot have our boss coming out here and looking at how we're running training
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000 and calling us out.
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000 And a lot of it was, for an, I'll give you an example.
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000 Go onto an IAD's range and a platoon is decided to have their 60 gunner
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000 walk point because that's going to work good for an immediate action drill.
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000 But that's not what you're really going to do.
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000 That's patrol to contact.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000 That's not what we're training in an immediate action drill.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000 We're training for a sucker punch.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000 And he's like, what and the why we're the sports is going on here.
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000 And we'd be like, yeah, but guys wouldn't want to tell the platoon
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000 be one of these small things where, and, and, and, and I failed in this
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000 and in, and leadership a lot of times where it just like, I'll just let that slide.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000 I'll just let that pretty soon everything sliding and you're not really given people any guidance.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000 But, um, yeah, people come out.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000 You got to be honest with the critique and look at it and then move forward.
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000 And at the end of the day, you always kind of know when you're wrong and it,
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000 to take ownership of it, you feel better about it because now you have power over it.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000 Right?
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000 And then it's like, oh, if I think that the, the trade-out staff,
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.000 is cheating, non-powerless against it and it's just kind of a stress that I'm going to deal.
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000 Exactly.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000 They're just going to win.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000 It doesn't matter blah blah.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000 And then it's, it's also on on a trade-out.
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000 It's, and it's difficult to, to debrief people and not come off as condescending.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000 That's a real skill.
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000 And that's the sum guys are really good at that.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000 And that's something I try to work on.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000 And I, I'm not perfect at it, but this is,
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000 it gives people constructive criticism in a manner that they're accepted to.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000 Yeah, I wasn't.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000 One of the things I'm talking about that, and trade-out is you don't really have a good relationship with 50% of the guys that come
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000 to come through.
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000 So some guys that come through, like when you're coming through in like,
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000 Hey, bro, like, we, I could do this like, be pretty straight up with you.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000 Yeah.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000 Some guys that don't really know you and you're from like a different team and I never worked with you before.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000 So I have no sort of sort of relationship.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000 And then it's a harder, you know, to say, hey man, that was a really bad job.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000 You know, now I, I don't know.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000 What I, what I ended up doing to trade-out was I would just be like, hey, this is what happened.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000 You know, and by the way, I recorded you on my audio thing.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000 Like I would carry a little voice recorder.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000 And then when people would be panicking or freaking out, I would record them.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000 And I'd say you were kind of freaking out out there.
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000 And they'd say, I was freaking out.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Okay, listen to this.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000 Everybody, everybody, they'd say,
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000 They're like, is that sound like freaking out to you?
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000 Is that your calm voice?
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:23.000 So the, and the other fun thing about the Dits gear was,
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000 you could hit them with the near miss because if they got killed,
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000 they would get now drug through the desert by their ankle.
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000 Yeah.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000 And guys didn't want to die.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000 So they still weren't as honest about fires.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000 They could be, but they would still like,
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000 my favorite thing to do would be put the God gun,
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000 which is just a regular thing I had as a lane grader on near miss.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000 And if guys were screwing around,
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000 like they would not, you know, they'd all be standing up in a perimeter
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000 where they shouldn't be standing,
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000 and I would just near miss them all.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000 Guys would just die.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000 Yeah.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000 They live in a real house.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000 They was like legitimate real rounds are covered out of where they'd hear that near miss
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000 because they didn't want to get drug through the desert for freaking two
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000 kilometers to the extract point.
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000 Have all their gear beat up and bruised.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000 Come on.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000 Punished all their whoever has to carry use is getting completely punished.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000 Okay, I feel my foesman.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000 I feel my foes.
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000 Yeah.
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000 Well, I would then younger guys coming out.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000 You know, everyone talks about the big,
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000 malignal rules.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000 And I'm, I'm, I'm, from what I've seen when I, when I've talked to teams,
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000 and when I've gone out to some training sites, guys are awesome.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000 I think across the board they are.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000 Yeah.
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000 I mean, I've looked at all the new guys.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000 And the quality of the new guys now compared to who I was.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000 Yeah.
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000 I'm not sure I could have made it through Katrina.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000 If I was compared against all the guys now, they're smart.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000 They're motivated and they're hard.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000 Yeah.
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000 And they're only coming in because they want to go to war.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000 Yeah.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000 Because that's a given.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000 Yeah.
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Did I want to go to war?
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000 Absolutely.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000 But it wasn't a known thing.
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000 I got to admit that I kind of thought it was.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000 I thought like a, I'm going to nom.
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000 Yeah.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000 I think I'm going to nom in 1991.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000 Yeah.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000 But yeah, these guys know for a fact.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000 I mean, they, they, they see, they see, you know, memorial services on TV.
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000 They know what's what they're getting into for sure.
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:31.000 And the complaints, the complaints about the Millennials that I hear are that,
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000 oh, they want to know why they're doing something.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000 Well, duh.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000 Yeah.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000 You know, and you just covered that in that document that was written after
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000 a war two that says, hey, guess what?
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000 You need to tell guys why they're doing something or they're not going to be the most effective.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000 And it's, it's generationally, generationally, it's just more blame casting
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000 or people are blinding about the next generation.
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000 Yeah.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000 It goes back forever.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000 That's just normal, right?
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000 I think it's one of those normal whiny things that you got to be.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000 You know, the young guys suck.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000 Uh-huh.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000 Little, you suck.
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000 When I was at one of the, the leadership courses with some regular Navy leadership
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000 and one of the master chiefs was telling a story that she had an E5,
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000 that she worked in, in supply.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000 And she's like, hey, I need you to go do the inventory today.
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.000 And she's checks back, comes back like an hour and a half later.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000 And uh, the guy had to go inventory this whole warehouse.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000 And he's hanging out in the coffee lounge and I don't have later.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000 And she's like, hey, what the heck is going on here?
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000 She's like, I did the inventory.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000 And she's like, no way.
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000 That takes all day.
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000 Let's spot check it.
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000 Spotchit is randomly pulls up a couple items off that inventory list.
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000 Checks it.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 She's like, how did you do this?
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000 And he's like, well, you know, I got this app reader on my phone.
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000 And I just went and scanned all the bar codes used his phone and completed the inventory,
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000 like that with a little bit of ingenuity.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000 And so basically she just told them the end state and got out of his way.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000 It was by accident, but she got out of his way and let him figure out how something to do it.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000 And then then went with it.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000 Nothing wrong with that.
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000 No.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000 What about you for you as you've gotten older?
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000 What kind of mindset changes have you gone through?
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000 Where?
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000 Like, I just kind of talked about one from my perspective as I got older.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000 Let's see, see different things.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000 And I always try and make that perfectly clear to everyone that you know, I kind of,
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000 you know, I learned.
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000 I learned and I'm still learning.
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000 And so, you know, would you, what, what, what, like, were some things that if you
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000 could have learned or changed your mentality on earlier?
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000 Like what?
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000 Yeah, I mean, shutting down the ego.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000 You know, a lot of my growth honestly is being married to Iris and is a hundred percent responsible for her.
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000 And it just shuts down here ego.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:25.000 Shots my ego down, but then has honest conversations about, well, what are you really thinking here?
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:35.000 And then, you know, actually listening to what someone saying because the, the trap I used to fall into was when someone was talking to me,
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000 I wasn't really listening to them.
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000 I was just formulating what I was going to say back to them.
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000 Formulating your counter punch.
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.000 Exactly.
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000 And I probably score a high and trait disagreeableness.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000 Yeah.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000 So, you know, it's just my nature to want to be at that point of friction, but that also makes me just,
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000 you know, want to go stick my finger in people's eyes and offend them and stuff like that.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:10.000 And so, stepping back and opening my mind up to other points of view.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:17.000 And then being a little bit more cognizant of other people and how they're reacting to me.
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000 So, I kind of just Hawaiian or act with them relationship wise.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000 I don't know if you remember this question at the Master Guide asked, hey, what, what do you do when you,
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:34.000 how do you deal with someone who's super negative and about, you know, the, the, the team or whatever.
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000 And, you know, I said, here's a really good leadership technique that you can use.
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000 It's very complicated.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000 It's called Listen.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000 How much you listen to them?
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000 But you actually listen to what people are saying, somebody feels really negative about my team.
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000 Guess what?
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000 I want to know why.
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000 I want to actually hear their explanation as to why they're being super negative.
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000 And by the way, when you allow someone to voice their opinion and you listen to them,
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000 carefully instead of formulating a counter punch, which is what our instinct is to do.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000 If instead of you, hmm, okay, what's wrong Jason, what's, what's the problem over here?
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000 I actually want to listen to you.
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000 I want to hear what you have to say.
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:17.000 And that is such an advantage as a leader instead of always feeling like, hey, anybody that steps to me is getting crushed.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000 Look, no, actually, anyway, it steps to me is going to teach me something.
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000 And I'm happy to hear it.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000 Yeah, boom.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:32.000 And then just being aware of, you know, my biases.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000 And then I find this a lot of times with the dang media presses the heck out of my buttons.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:47.000 And so I got to the point where I just, I don't want to news anymore because the news is hard.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.000 It's there to get you angry, so you'll pay attention to it and gets them better ratings.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000 And a lot of times when I'll see some really extreme things that they're claiming people said,
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000 when I dig into it, when I actually take the time to dig into it, it's like not quite what it was.
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000 And now that I've become a lot more introspective.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000 And so I'm paying attention to how things make me react.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000 I'm paying attention to when my face flushes out or I grip and I'm like, okay, now it's time to detach and step back.
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000 I've noticed that it's just like, it's not a positive, positive, you know,
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000 thing in my life to have my blood pressure spiked again and again and again and again,
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000 because I've got a 24 hour news feed coming in.
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000 Yeah.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000 And so another team that I pointed this out to me, he's like, hey, let's talk about the news.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000 And I was all angry about something and he's like, you know what, I quit watching the news.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000 And he goes, I'm a lot happier since I stopped watching the news.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000 It doesn't matter.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000 And I'm like, are you kidding me?
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000 Of course it matters.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.000 But he planted a little seed and watered it and then I'm like, okay, I'm going to quit watching the news.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Yeah.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000 And it doesn't matter.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000 And I was to the point where I'll just check the news like first thing in the morning to make sure
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000 of volcano and stuff.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000 Right.
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000 Now I don't even do that.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000 If there's a volcano going off, I'll see the smoke or someone will tell you.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000 Yeah, you're going to find out about it.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000 The 24 hour news cycle is filled with a lot of things that you don't need to know.
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000 You don't need to know at all.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000 And that's the kind of way I am.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000 I mean, I still look at it, but it doesn't.
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000 I'm completely, I can look at, I can look at 19 headlines in a row.
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000 And none of them have any remote impact on my mentality at all until I see one that says,
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000 Oh, there was a terror bombing here.
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000 And I go, okay, let's see what's going on or.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000 Hey, there was a US servicemen killed here and I'm like, okay.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000 But every other of the 17 headlines that I read that were,
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:47.000 I'm trying to think of a good one right now because they're just, you know,
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000 everything is going down.
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000 I don't even like, okay, fine, yeah, I admit, no, everything's not going down.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000 The world isn't going to end.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000 But it's clickbait isn't.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000 Yeah, it is.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000 And I, you guys are the first ones I heard used that word.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000 I'm like, oh, that's what that is.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000 Was exactly what it's going on, clickbait, but it's just clickbait on the TV to get you
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000 to dial in and get them higher.
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000 Oh, yeah.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000 And then we got to listen that Sam Harris and I forget the females name that was on,
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000 but she did this whole research about it talking about how the Russian,
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000 the Russian bots and all that stuff.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000 And yeah, you can create headlines that are going to make people click.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000 And then you can make fictional random, you can just make up stories.
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000 I know.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000 And people catch, you know, someone else will report that story as being true.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000 It's a crazy world.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000 The onion, is that joke and newspaper?
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000 Yeah, they've got their A.P. is picked.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000 Their stuff up like two or three times before.
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000 Totally nuts.
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:50.000 So you've got to learn, you should definitely add a middle mom learn to detach when you read the news.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000 Yeah.
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000 And then something that I found real helpful is, is putting a filter on my thoughts.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000 So the, and as is something that Iris is kind of talked about.
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000 She's like the first filter is am I whining?
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000 And then the second filter is am I resentful?
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000 And then the third filter is am I jealous?
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000 And if I can just catch that stuff, once I identify it, it doesn't bother me anymore.
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000 But prior to identifying it, if I'm just like, oh, someone told you,
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000 just got a promotion.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000 That's bullshit.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000 He, you know, and then I realized, wait a minute,
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000 I should be happy for him for getting that promotion.
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000 And Jordan Peterson says something about be careful
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000 who you share good news with.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000 And, and, and I just don't, that's not, that's not something I, I,
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000 I'm proud of when I see it come up in myself and that's one of the things that,
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000 that as I age, I'm, I'm trying to fix the other thing that that as I've gotten older is I used to be very
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000 group identified with.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000 And now I find myself becoming more of an individual.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000 If that makes sense.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000 And this, this is, that's where I'm trying to go.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000 And this is, this is the path that, that I'm on.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 And it's, it's a struggle.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000 And it all comes down.
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000 And I kind of wish there was two words for ego, right?
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000 Because the ego, if I didn't have an ego driving me to be better,
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000 yeah.
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000 I, I would just be sitting at home, meeting chocolate and cookies on the couch.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Right.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000 There's not two words to describe ego, but there is the dichotomy of it.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000 And then you're good to go.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000 Yeah.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000 You know, one of my team guy buddies, a long time ago,
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000 we could use this phrase, which I, which I always remembered because I thought it was really good.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000 Basically someone was whining about something.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000 And you know, you know, raise their hand and say,
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000 well, you know why we're doing this.
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000 And then afterwards, my buddy goes, hey, that's cool.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000 Put yourself on report for being a bitch.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:05.000 And so like, I've been hypersensitive to that for a long time.
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000 I do not ever, you know, I don't care what I'm going through.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000 I will not complain about anything.
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000 Like I am hypersensitive about that.
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000 At least I try to be, I mean, you know, cold,
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000 and I'm not going to say anything.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000 You know, hurt.
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000 I hurt my knee.
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000 And I, my knee was also one of all jacked up.
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000 And I didn't tell anyone.
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000 I was a little bit, hey, I injured my knee.
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000 No, no factor.
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000 And finally, life was like, hey, you know,
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000 what's up with your knee?
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000 I said to my picture.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000 Like the knee is just twice as big as the other one.
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000 He's like, oh, my God.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000 Are you going to need surgery?
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000 I'm like, no, no factor.
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000 But, and I only sent it to him like six or seven days.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000 The swelling had gone down.
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000 But out of the gate, I wasn't going to say anything because I don't,
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000 I don't want to sit there and complain.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000 Like, bro, I hurt my knee.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000 Doing Gigiitsu.
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000 Oh, no.
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000 You know what I mean?
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000 Like, come on, bro.
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000 I'm not going to complain about that.
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000 But yeah, those are other things about being resentful and being jealous.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000 Whenever I feel that tension of,
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000 when I feel that tension of jealousy,
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000 when I feel that tension of, when I feel like,
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000 when I feel like mad at someone,
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000 for doing something, I automatically know it's me.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000 I automatically, and I've known that for years.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000 There was a stone or as a matter of fact,
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000 was going to, he wanted to go to Princeton.
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000 And he, he said to me, he, and he,
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000 I wasn't, we weren't together at Team 3 anymore.
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000 And so he was talking to some people.
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000 And finally, he comes to me and he says,
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000 hey man, I want to go to Princeton.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000 I want to put together this package and go to Princeton.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000 He said, but some of the other people I'm talking to
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000 are telling me it'd be bad for my career.
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000 And I'm like, bro, those guys are just jealous.
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000 That's not happening.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000 I go, you go and you get your freaking degree from Princeton.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000 Are you kidding me?
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000 How is that going to be bad for any day,
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000 and he did, he ended up doing it. And he got, he got it,
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000 and he got accepted.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000 And, but that was one of those things where it was so obvious to me.
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000 Like whoever told you that is just telling you that,
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000 because they don't want you to have another punk car to pull on you.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000 Because like, hey, your stone or your, you know,
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000 you've got a bunch of combat experience,
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000 you've got a bunch of combat awards,
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000 your, your, this big strapping dude,
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000 and by the way, you're going to go to Princeton.
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000 Like no one wanted that final punk car to be issued this donor.
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000 It's hard when you see someone else that's successful.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000 And you know that like,
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000 I should be getting up off my ass and getting into Princeton myself,
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000 or going, you know,
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000 you can't control whether or not you're deployed to combat.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000 But a lot of other stuff is,
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000 and I think that's where it gets painful for guys.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000 It's like, okay, well, I'm not going to make the effort.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000 So I don't want anybody else to make the effort either.
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000 I'm a crab in this bucket, and I'm going to drag that crab
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000 that's trying to climb out back in the bucket.
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000 And this is actually in a way the warrior could three.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000 This is why I had to address this,
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000 which in a way the warrior could three, you know, have you read it yet?
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000 Not yet.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000 It's a way the warrior kid,
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000 there's a new character that comes as a name as Danny Ryan Hart.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000 And he's like good at everything.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000 He's better at Mark than everything.
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000 He's like a little bit smarter,
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000 it does better on the test in school,
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000 and he's a little bit faster,
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000 and he can do more pull ups,
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000 and then like to take the cake,
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000 because he's a new kid moves in,
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000 and Mark still thinks he's got the ultimate punk card to pull,
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000 which is I do due to get to,
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000 and I can choke you some of the other stuff matters.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000 It turns out Danny Ryan Hart's been training for two more years.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000 And that's exactly what happens.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000 Mark, instead of saying,
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:30.000 wow, I can learn from you, wow, you can help me, wow.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000 That's awesome.
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000 I know you work hard for that,
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000 instead he just tries to undermine and he just is jealous.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000 And so that's something that you deal with when you're starting to be,
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000 even as a little kid, you know?
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000 Yep, as you've got a little kid, you can be jealous.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000 So checking to check yourself,
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000 if you're being resentful, if you're jealous of someone,
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000 those are like the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone,
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000 those are the first things I check when I start getting mad at someone I go,
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000 and I be in jealous right now, yes I am.
01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000 Yes I am.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000 Yes I am.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000 Yeah, that is not good.
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000 And what's worked out really well for me,
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000 is when you identify these people that are good at everything,
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000 keep them around you.
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000 Oh, for sure.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000 For sure.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000 And that's the other the other clincher in the way the word you could
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000 three is Danny Reinhardt.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000 He's not only like better, he's also like a really nice kid.
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000 Yeah.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000 And so that makes Mark even madder.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000 Because everyone wants to be friends with him.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000 Yeah, because he's nice.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000 So yeah, you got to watch out for that.
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000 Check yourself.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000 Don't get that.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000 I wanted to talk about some leadership mistakes that you've made.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000 And I was thinking myself, well, I could call out Jason for leadership
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000 mistakes that he's made.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000 That's kind of jacked up if I don't talk about it.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000 I mean, leadership mistakes that I've made.
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000 Now, of course, I've listed a bunch of leadership
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000 mistakes that I've made in that kind of be of leadership
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000 and an extreme ownership.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000 So there's that.
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000 But I got a couple that I thought of.
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000 And I'll try to think of some broad ones.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000 One of them is when I was in Ramadi.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000 I hate to start off like that.
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000 When I was in Ramadi, I did not do a,
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:11.000 as good a job as I should have.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000 And I'll go a little bit further.
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000 To keeping the rest of our community informed as to what was happening
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000 and why it was happening.
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000 And to be honest with you, the reason I say I'll go further
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000 than I just didn't keep them informed, I wasn't even thinking about it.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000 I wasn't even thinking about it.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000 When I got home and one of our good friends said to me,
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000 and he was all fired up and he's like, we were reading your,
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000 he's like, we read your A, R's or quarters every day.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000 Like, so every day at trade at at the time while we were in Ramadi,
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000 they were reading the A, R's, the after action report for the A.
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000 They killed nine guys.
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000 They killed seven guys.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000 And that's, you know, I was like, hey, that's awesome.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:55.000 That's cool.
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000 I didn't really even think of that.
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000 But what I also didn't think of was guys that were saying,
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000 hey, wait a second, what do these guys doing over there?
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000 Wait a second, wait, why are you conducting operations during the day time?
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000 Hey, wait a second, why are you staying out after you get contacted?
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000 Why are you staying in position?
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000 Hey, wait a second, why are you working alongside the conventional forces?
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000 Why aren't you doing stuff with just special operations?
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000 And I did a bad job of explaining these things to our community as a whole.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000 And even when we got back, I had the opportunity to do it.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000 And I spread the word to some people and was able to explain to them.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000 But by then, some people had already thought, oh, well, these guys were just over there.
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000 Do doing these rogue operations by themselves and they shouldn't have been doing it.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000 So that's, that's one, that's one big one that I wish it would have done a better job.
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000 And I just, I just wasn't even paying attention.
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000 And you know what it's like, man, I mean, this is my, this is my excuse is my, it's my fault.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000 Because I was over there and I'm thinking like, hey, we got an opportunity.
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000 And like, hey, we got an operation tomorrow. I got two, I got two elements going out of the field.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000 I'm not worried about what they're thinking.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000 Like, I just didn't even think of it. And I should have.
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000 So I don't know if that's an excuse. It's the reason why I didn't think of it way.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000 I should have. And I was wrong for not doing that.
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000 How much bandwidth could you have expanded on it though in the moment?
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000 You know what? If I would have been a little bit smarter and a little bit better,
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000 I could have taken 15 minutes to send out an email and say, hey, everyone,
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000 want to let you know what this up was really like, is there really the obsomes, right?
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000 The obsomes is an official document. If I could have supplemented that with hey guys,
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000 Joko here, I know this one sounds a little bit crazy. Here's what's going on.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000 The Iraqi soldiers that we're working with, they don't have night vision.
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:47.000 They have one flashlight, purifier team to go out at night with these guys is completely,
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000 it doesn't work. And so we got to go out in the daytime with them sometimes.
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000 And so that's what we're doing. Here's why we're doing it. You know,
01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000 I could have done it. I could have expanded a little bit and I just didn't have the awareness that I should have had
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000 to explain these things. Also to explain them in plain English.
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000 Because it's one thing to read the obsome. That's an official document.
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000 That's written a certain way. It's another thing to say, hey guys,
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000 Joko here. Here's what's going on.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.000 Because I mean, let's face it at that time. I'd been in for a long time.
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000 And I had friends everywhere. I mean, and when my friends would reach out to me,
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000 this is probably should have been my best indicator.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000 Some of my friends that reached out to me and said, hey dude, what's going on?
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000 Like, I heard you just got to go, I heard one of you guys got shot.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000 What's going on? How's that happening? And I had one specific friend of mine who wrote me like a long email.
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000 And I wrote him back, right? And today, man, this is what's going on.
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000 But that should have been an indicator if one of my friends was reaching out to me and saying, hey,
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000 what's going on? I should have been more cognizant in the fact that people beyond.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000 And people that didn't know me at all, you know, would be thinking, you know,
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000 well, this guy's a hyper aggressive and they're just out there,
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.000 taking too many risks. It's like, no. And what was cool was there was some guys that were in
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000 Ramadi, other seals that were in Ramadi are working in and around Ramadi at the time,
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000 who I knew. And they were like, you guys are crushed. You guys are doing great.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000 This is awesome. Yeah. But I didn't do a good job. So that's that's one thing.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000 I don't know what it looked like for your perspective. Where were you when I was there?
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:28.000 In Paycom, pull side at Thailand, explaining to my guys why we had to put the missions first.
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000 Yeah, check, check. Yeah.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.000 But at the time, I was excited for you guys because it was like the, that was like the first
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:46.000 sustained heavy combat of that war. Yeah. Yeah. Everything had been.
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000 We were talking about the big news to stand around and talk about when you were at
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000 the bar was was maybe a tick or a firefight lasted five minutes.
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000 Yeah. And you guys were troops in contact a hundred percent of the time every time
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000 you walked outside the gate. Yeah. It wasn't quite that, but it was a lot. Yeah.
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:09.000 And then that's for sure. And that's what that's what I think I think I should have explained that better
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000 than I did throughout the community. And you know, I still talk guys.
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000 I still have the opportunity when I was, you know, some guys that I'll, I'll still explain this to some guy
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000 that I haven't seen because you know, as you run to have a few, you know, seen in 15 years.
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000 Yeah. They'll be like, do what you do over there.
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000 Okay. Let me explain it to you. I've had people sit through kind of the, the Ramadi brief
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000 and be like, okay, I get it. I get, yeah, that makes sense. Roger.
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000 But yeah, should have done a better job of that from a leadership perspective.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000 I was trying to think of a tactical example of, and this is really easy story.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000 Once I'm my personally chased down some dude over multiple rooftops as a, in Baghdad, you know, like
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000 just got in the one man pursuit, well, I had another guy like trailing me, but
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:59.000 basically, we're hitting a target. There's a squirger. I'm outside the building as it's
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000 happening and also, you know, the, the overhead asset reports that there's a squirger
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.000 and he jumped to another rooftop. And I had a radio, the radioman was like near me.
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000 And we both know the radioman. And he's like, hey, he's like, you went to the next roof.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:23.000 And I was like, got him. And so I climb up a palm tree, a climb up a palm tree, like
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000 in between a palm tree and like the garage and I get to the roof and I get and
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000 he's like, he jumped to the next one and so the radio, the J attack is in the street
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000 with me following down and telling me what's going on. And basically, I left my, I
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000 shouldn't have done that. You know, I should have sent a couple guys and eventually
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000 I got with someone else with me and then we got the guy. But you know, I just was trying
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000 to have, hey, where did I make some mistakes? Where that were more on a tactical level.
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:55.000 And that's one right there is, you know, I'm in charge of the assault. And if I'm out there
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000 chasing the guy from the rooftop, I'm not doing my job.
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000 But they did have it on video. And it was pretty awesome to watch.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000 And I tried to get a hold of it. But of course, it's classified so I couldn't have it.
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000 It was pretty cool to watch, you know, you can like park or in the pit.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.000 Yeah, it's going to palm tree and then jump from rooftop roof and then eventually
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000 they're like, hey, so that one right there. And yeah, so that was one.
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000 And then the last thing again, I was trying to think of like a variety of different
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000 mistakes. And here's something from a leadership perspective that I really,
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000 when I look back, I wish I would have done a better job. And that's helping guys with
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000 their finances. Young guys. I mean, how many young guys
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.000 reinlaced, they get $150,000 reinlustment bonus. And they show up at work two days later.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:55.000 They've got a new Ford F350 super duty, Harley Davidson version.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000 And they have, you know, they have a $62,000 truck.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000 That is now worth, they just had it for a day. And they've now worth 48,000.
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000 So they already lost money. And guys that would rent instead of bought, you know,
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000 just all those things where, and I wasn't like super at it.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000 But I was ahead. And I should have been telling guys like, hey, man, let me talk to you.
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000 Hey, guys, let's do a little, let's do talk for a half an hour about where you're at.
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:28.000 Right now, let's come up with a strategic objective of where you're going to be in five
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000 years. You know, T.E.S. don't want to be renting apartment in IB.
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000 Because that's probably not great. Or do you want to be buying a place, get with one of your buddies.
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000 So I never talked about that kind of stuff. And again, what it boils down to is my own,
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000 my own being obsessed. Like, I didn't care about that stuff. You know what I mean?
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000 I guess I cared about it enough to do it. And I got lucky. I had an officer one time.
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000 That said, I bought a house every three years and kept it. He just said that to me.
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000 And I was like, that seems like a really good idea. And that's what I tried to do.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000 But I didn't pass that word on. And I could probably help out more guys.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000 So kind of a bummer on that one.
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:17.000 I, yeah, because that aspect, I completely dropped the ball on that early in my career as well.
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000 Later on, I got a little bit better at it. But, you know, because I didn't 30.
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000 But I could tell a guy how to be a good shooter.
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000 Yeah. But then I didn't look at the whole rest of the dang pie chart.
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:35.000 And realize that if I fixed all that other stuff,
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000 they'd be any better shooter.
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000 Exponentially better. Right?
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000 And, yeah, that, that was something that, that actually helping guys.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000 And then we're stuff that, this is, this is something I really failed at is like,
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000 I could see guys messing up.
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000 But I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation with them.
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000 So like, bro, you got to, you got to kind of fix this.
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000 Like, hey, you know, you've used the analogy before.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000 I have a booker hanging out. I want somebody to tell me.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000 And so I see, you get mad at them.
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000 Who's talking about, I wanted that booker there.
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.000 No, I, I definitely wouldn't.
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.000 I had some of those conversations for sure.
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000 And I'm sure you did, too. Like, hey, this girl.
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000 She's not the one. I'm going to tell you that right now.
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000 Uh, this isn't going to work out well for you.
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000 The problem is getting somebody to listen to that conversation is real hard when it comes to the ladies.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000 Yeah, and that aspect of just, most times it blows up in your face.
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000 And then sometimes you're just like, hey, I realize that maybe I'm going to lose my friendship with you.
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000 True.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000 But, uh, I got to tell you this.
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:55.000 And later on in my career when I started to start like struggling with anger issues.
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000 And it were probably a result of my combat deployments.
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000 And started to go sit down with a psych.
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000 And I would see, you know, you were super angry even before.
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000 I was like, I was like probably pretty pretty predisposed to it all.
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000 And I just met, it just turned it up to 11, right?
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000 And, uh, and then I would see myself and other guys.
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000 And I would tell him, hey, man, here's the deal.
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000 Here's the psych's number.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000 I want you just to give them a call.
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000 And you don't have to see him after that, but do me this favor.
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000 And some guys it would help and other guys, I made the effort.
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000 And they'll come to that conclusion at some point.
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000 But it's like, son, you know, we got to look out, look out for each other and do the best we can.
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000 And that was something that, you know, missed out on.
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:51.000 Uh, I think I probably would have made an awesome platoon chief about the time I was an ops master chief.
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:58.000 Two echelons above it and really realized what that job was because that as a platoon chief,
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:06.000 one of the things that I missed out on was that the guys are always looking at me to set the example.
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:15.000 And so it was one thing during working hours like it's set an example, but if I'm a buffoon out drinking too hard, they're like you're an idiot.
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000 Or they follow your example.
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000 And they they'll follow my example and think that this is acceptable behavior.
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000 Uh, if if I'm going to bad mouth my leadership, which is I'm embarrassed to say it, but it's just stuff that if I didn't.
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:38.000 Didn't really have my aperture open on the big picture and would complain about the command and then I complain in front of the guys just screwing them over.
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000 And I did because they're like, well, he's whining.
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000 Yeah.
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000 Now I'm going to go ahead and whine.
01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:55.000 Uh, I had issues where like personally I didn't like the person that I was working directly for.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000 And that that tainted my interaction with that person.
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000 I didn't have any relationship with them.
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:15.000 And then my whole platoon would suffer because I had a bad relationship with the next guy up just because I didn't like them, which is complete weak sauce.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000 Oh yeah, I was having a conversation with Dave Burke.
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000 Yeah.
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:30.000 And it was we had that he just quoted me yesterday, I was hanging out with him and with the quote was like whatever six months ago, we're having a conversation.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:42.000 And I said something like, hey, Dave, whether I love you or hate you, you won't know either way.
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:50.000 And he was like, he said, well, it kind of freaks me out because you're super nice to me and now I think you could just hate me and don't care.
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000 And you know, we laughed about it.
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000 But that's exactly right. And that is the truth.
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.000 Like the guys that I hated never knew it.
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000 I mean, to this day, they don't know it.
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:10.000 And so I mean, you and I were having a conversation about a couple of people that I obviously don't like at all.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000 They don't know that.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000 So you've got to be professional at all at all times.
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000 And it's a very small number of people.
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000 Most people are pretty cool to me, you know, and most people support what I'm trying to get done.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000 So I'm pretty lucky in that way.
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000 But yeah, if you let that out, that's bad.
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000 Is there ever really a reason not to be polite?
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000 Yeah, very seldom.
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000 Yeah.
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000 You could politely punch someone in the face.
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000 And you could just punch him in the face.
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000 Here's what people can do.
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000 Here's what people can do.
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000 Here's what people can do.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000 You know, that's what you're talking with, Joko.
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000 Your kiss ass.
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000 It's like, actually, let me tell you what I actually want to do.
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.000 What I actually want to do is I want to sap my batoon, able to get the sport that they need.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000 What I actually want to do is I want to be able to have my batoon get the sport that they need.
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000 So that we can actually do a better job doing our mission.
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000 That's what I'm doing.
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000 What I care about is my guys and my mission.
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000 That's what I actually care about.
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:12.000 And if I've got to be polite to someone to make that happen, if I've got to overlook the fact that someone might not be the personality type that I particularly like,
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000 I don't care.
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000 I don't care.
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000 Guess what?
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000 I'm going to deal with it.
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.000 I'm going to accept that I'm going to absorb whatever kind of crap that they want to throw.
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000 And I'm going to deal with it.
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:22.000 It's fine.
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:29.000 Now, do you get into situations where you actually have a bad boss that you have to show?
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000 Let's face it.
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:38.000 If I'm treating you like a piece of shit or I'm making really bad decisions and all you do is support me and you're a yes man,
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000 well your guys are going to lose respect for you.
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000 So there's times where you have to say, hey, listen guys, the years what's going on.
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000 I don't agree with everything that the boss says, but you know what?
01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000 He's the boss right now.
01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:55.000 And what we're going to do is try the easiest way the way for me to get him to make better decisions is if he trusts me.
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000 So right now what we're going to do is we're going to kick ass.
01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000 And so suck it up, quit complaining.
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.000 We're going to do a great job and I'm going to get a better relationship over him where he will start listening to me and we'll move forward.
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000 And by the way, unless we're going to have a mute me, which we're not going to have.
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000 This is the best option.
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000 The other option is me to have an antagonistic relationship with the boss in which case all he's going to do is screw us over.
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000 So how do you guys want to play this?
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000 You know what I mean?
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000 So sometimes you've got to be transparent about that stuff and that's fine too.
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000 I mean, I've been in situations where I've had to do that where it's like, okay, hey guys, here's what's going on.
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000 I know this seems a little bit crazy.
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000 I know that the boss may seem like he's making a rash decision on this.
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000 Here's what we're going to do.
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000 Let's explain his perspective.
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000 Here's what the boss is seeing.
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000 He doesn't want this to happen again.
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000 He's tightening the news.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000 He's tightening the bleach way more than I want him to.
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000 But guess what?
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000 Let's show him that he can let loose on the leash again.
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000 Let's get in line.
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000 You'll see, you've got to have those conversations sometimes.
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000 But broadly, I'm going to get along with everybody.
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000 Why not?
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000 I want to do my mission.
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000 I want to take care of my guys the best way to do that is if I have good relationships up and down the chain of command.
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000 Boom.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000 Oh, question.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000 What?
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000 So, and you know I don't like you.
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000 In your even in secret.
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000 In your view.
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000 The secret is out.
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000 Yeah.
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000 That's kind of got that either way.
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000 In your view, what?
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000 What's the difference between that?
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000 How you say, like you get along, like even if you don't, if you really don't like someone they don't ever know.
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000 In your view, what's the difference between that and being like, oh, what do you go like?
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000 Like a two face or a, you know, like let's say, all these are two face person or whatever.
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000 Well, one big thing is I'm not, I'm not, I'm not getting along with some sort.
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:34.000 I can, so that I can better my own life.
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000 I'm not doing it, so I can take care of me.
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000 Yeah.
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000 Because I don't really care about me.
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000 I'm doing it, so I can do my job well, so I can take care of my petun, so I can take care of my team, so I can accomplish my mission.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000 That's number one.
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000 If I'm doing it, so I can get the promotion.
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000 I'm actually the guy that I don't like.
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000 The guy that's like, oh, I'm doing this, so I can get promoted, no, I'm not doing that.
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000 And that's another thing.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000 The troops see through that every single time.
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000 Everybody knows.
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000 They have a name for it in the teams.
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000 That guy is a ticket puncher.
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.000 They're trying to get their ticket puncher.
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.000 Oh, he's just trying to get his ticket punch.
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.000 He's trying to grab onto that guy's, grab a hold of that person's coat tails and ride him up.
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000 You know, ride him up to the neck rank.
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000 It's like, no, everyone sees through that.
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000 If you're doing the right thing, so the right reasons people are like, hey, you know what?
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000 Jocquille, you're, I mean, every time people look, do your patient guy.
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000 Leave Babin told me that.
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000 And he said, hey, you're so patient.
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000 I don't see how you do.
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000 I don't see how you do it.
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000 You know, this is when he was younger.
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000 Like, bro, how do you deal with that?
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000 I care about our task unit.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000 I will make this happen.
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000 I can absorb some impacts.
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000 No factor.
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000 Bring it.
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000 I remember when I was working the club.
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000 And I was in guy.
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000 What?
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000 That was too face.
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000 And when I listened to you like, how you're like, oh, yeah, because he said that before.
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000 They, you like, if you didn't like someone, they probably wouldn't know.
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000 And I was like, oh, yeah, yeah, they make sense.
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000 You know, because it, like, it helps the relationship, helps morale, like, helps all these things, right?
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000 And then, so I think, oh, yeah, a two face guy, there was a distinct difference.
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000 And one of the main things on top of what you said, because what you said was like,
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000 I think a little bit more thorough, ultimately view,
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000 mine is a little bit more.
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.000 I should, I say.
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000 Strap forward.
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000 Ground level.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000 I guess.
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000 Can I guess what you're going to say?
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.000 Sure.
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:19.000 Because the other option, the other answer I was going to give is I'm not acting differently than one situation.
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000 I don't go.
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000 Hey boss.
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:21.000 Yes.
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000 I got it.
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000 And then go back for a two-to-go.
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000 He's an idiot.
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000 No, no, no, no, no.
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000 I don't do that.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000 I go.
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000 Hey boss.
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:29.000 You know what?
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000 And even if it was the situation where I was saying, like, I might go back and tell the guys,
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000 like, hey, guys, this is what's going on.
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000 I would tell the boss.
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000 I wouldn't say boss.
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000 That sounds like a greatest plan ever.
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000 Yeah.
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:36.000 No, I'd say, hey boss.
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000 I'm not, I don't think I'm 100% on board with this.
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000 I see some other ways we could give this done.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000 That's what you're telling me you want me to do.
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000 I'm going to make it happen.
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000 But I think we could, you know, I'm going to, so I don't act differently.
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:52.000 I'm not a different person in front of, you know, I was doing an event the other day.
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000 And I was like talking to a company.
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.000 And I was backstage talking to CEO.
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000 And we were just, you know, and all of a sudden, you know, there's like, he's like,
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000 hey, it's only another half an hour before you go on.
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000 Do you need some time?
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000 And I was like, no, I don't need any time because the person that's going to walk out on that stage is me.
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000 And I'm not acting any different way.
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000 It's just me.
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000 I'm going to, you know, I don't need to get into character.
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000 I'm in character.
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000 I'm walking around on me.
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000 This is me.
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000 And he's like, oh, that's awesome.
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000 So same thing.
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000 I don't, when I'm dealing with the boss that I don't like or whatever,
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000 I don't show that to anybody.
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.000 Yeah.
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000 Act differently.
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000 But you're, you're also, you're doing a good, you're doing a good,
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000 you're managing what hills are worth dying on.
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000 For sure. When you go to your boss so that you built up that equity with them.
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000 No doubt about that.
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000 When you need it, you can cash it in and that's why you have to establish those relationships with them.
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:54.000 That's what I really failed as a young leader before my aperture started to get opened up.
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000 Before I got introspective and I started thinking about all this stuff from a big picture.
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000 And then my little ego was in the way.
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:12.000 And, you know, if you're not, if you're not the guy that is bitching every time when you do bring something up in a respectful manner,
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000 then they're going to at least consider what you have to say.
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000 And nine times out of ten, they're actually going to go with it.
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.000 Oh, they're going to go with it.
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000 Yeah.
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000 That's, that's the, that's the extreme ownership story.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:26.000 Yeah.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:32.000 That's the, and it was me sitting around with your task and to come into the other task and to finish from all the different teams.
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000 And everyone's, you know, say they got this problem, that problem, the other problem.
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.000 You know, in the, the common or at the time, who was a friend of mine, says, hey, Jocca, what do you need?
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000 And I was like, they sure we don't need anything.
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000 We're good to go.
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:49.000 And, you like, it, you know, for whatever reason I was like the last guy to go.
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000 So it had even more impact because everyone was complaining about this day and the other thing.
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:53.000 Absolutely.
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:59.000 And he goes, he goes, Jocca, which, they gave it even more impact because he's just like, you know, he knows me because Jocca, what do you need?
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:08.000 I'm like, nothing sir, we're good to go. And you could say, you know, four months later when I go in there and I say, hey sir, we need X. He goes, cool.
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000 Go to supply. I'm calling him right now.
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000 Boom, taking care of.
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000 That's, that's how it should be.
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:26.000 Another thing that I was thinking about when you were talking, somebody asked me at some point, you know, at which, what point did you start sort of like looking at yourself?
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:39.000 Kind of what you're talking about. What point did I start to look at myself from an external position and say from a detached perspective and say, wait, are you being jealous? Are you being resentful? Are you complaining?
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:51.000 I can tell you right now that when I stepped into a leadership position, what I knew was that as you said, every guy in my pool tune is looking at me.
02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:00.000 I looked at myself the same way as a young and less like, my first leadership inside of a tune was as an assistant to him commander.
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000 He was an instant.
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:15.000 And so sure, I was a little bit, you know, when I was an E5, I was always a three-potune E5 and are you an alleaders position? You know, a little bit sure, but not really a little bit.
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:23.000 When I was a platoon-encin, I was thinking the whole time these guys are looking at me just like I used to look at my officer.
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:32.000 So if I complain that it's cold or I complain that it's because when my officers used to do that, do this sucks. Oh really?
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:41.000 I'd be like, I would, I would just, I would, I would get furious.
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000 And that's why that's the, when I really started looking at myself.
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:57.000 And I'll, quite frankly, when I started putting in an officer package as a young and less like, I was like, wait a second, these guys, I want these guys to think that I actually should be in charge.
02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:03.000 I need to tighten it up. They're looking at me right now thinking, why does Joko think he should be an officer? Here's why.
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000 Here's, I need to act like I actually deserve this.
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:21.000 So that was a real precursor to me looking at myself from the outside saying, I mean, I know what it's like to be an E5 and a platoon looking at the officer going, oh, you forgot that piece of gear, did you?
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:30.000 And you're in charge of me. You're making more money than me. You're making the decisions tonight on this operation. You didn't bring your hands set.
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:41.000 Really? That's where we're at. I know what that felt like. And so I held myself to a high standard because I didn't, didn't want somebody to be looking at me thinking,
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:48.000 Joko's complaining. He's weak. He's making up. He's, he forgot a piece of gear. He didn't show up on time.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000 He didn't show up on time. You know how many times I was late when I was in the US Navy for 20 years?
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.000 Zero. Zero times late. Zero. Never.
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000 Why paranoia? High level of paranoia? Don't want to have guys when my officers relate.
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000 I look at him and think, oh, you can't even show up on time. You're in charge of me.
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000 You know, that's a young arrogant kid for sure. Absolutely. That's me.
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:26.000 But I, I, I ate that and I held onto it. And that's one of the first things that made me, and at some point it turned from this kind of hostility
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:35.000 into like, you need to be a better person. You know, if you're going to be in charge, it went from like this attitude that I'm kind of portraying right now of like, oh, you suck.
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:42.000 Into like, hey, you need to do a better job. You need to hold yourself to a high standard.
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000 You need to be a better person. If you're going to be in charge of these guys, you need to hold the line and you do elevate that line.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:59.000 So that had that definitely had a big impact on me. And bro, if anybody knows this, you do, you knew me when I was at E4 20 years old, maniac, right?
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:06.000 Yeah. And then you, you know, you ran into me, what, how many years later? You know, it seems a little bit different, you know, not totally different.
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000 But because even when I was a young kid, I was fired up. Oh, yeah.
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000 But you know, I had to elevate, had to elevate some.
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.000 Yeah, that introspection is something that that I didn't figure out till way later.
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000 But I'm sure glad I'm dead because I think it paid off.
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:35.000 It's, that's one of the things and it's one of those things that, you know,
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000 Did your dad ever give you any advice?
02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000 Yeah. So did mine.
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.000 You know, much I listened to. This is about the same amount as I listened to my dad.
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:55.000 It's one of those things where you, you just, there's some things that you have that, that you, it's like you can't be taught.
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000 Yeah, but you, you, you, you, like someone can't tell you this.
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000 For some reason, there's something that people can't tell you.
02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:07.000 Unless you can just completely open your mind and get humble and put your ego in check, which is really hard to do when you're 22, 23, 24.
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000 Like there's things that I look at and I go, oh, you know what I've heard that before.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000 I learned that lesson. I got told that lesson, but I didn't learn it.
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000 But it's, you can pick it up pretty dang quick by, by example.
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000 And so, you know, how often do you get people asking you, well, how do I get that guy over there to take extreme ownership?
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000 Yeah.
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000 It's like you do it.
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000 Yeah.
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000 That's true.
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000 You take extreme ownership and it will be contagious.
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000 Yeah.
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000 Yeah.
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:42.000 And in, in that manner, when people see those modeled behaviors, then it just goes out.
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000 And it goes back to that thing that,
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000 that, late talks about, there's no bad teams, there's bad leaders.
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000 And I've seen groups, seal platoons and seal troops that have broad talent in them.
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000 Oh, for sure.
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000 And then they'll have kind of a guy come in. That's a tyrant.
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000 And an ego maniac.
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000 And that will permeate into everybody.
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:09.000 The same way as, you know, the one I see that you're talking about that I've worked around.
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000 Everywhere that guy goes, he lifts everybody else.
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000 Everyone that's around him becomes better by his example.
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000 Yeah.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000 Yep.
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000 Any other mistakes?
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000 Or major mistakes?
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000 You know, it just back to being when I was a, the troops senior in the U.S.
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000 The divisor of NAFTA and we were doing the remain over day operations.
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000 And there were a lot of my younger guys that didn't understand why we weren't going.
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000 Why we weren't just going in, hitting a target and coming out during the same cycle of darkness.
02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000 They felt like that would be more effective.
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000 And instead of sitting down with them and explaining to them why we were doing what we were doing.
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000 I would just tell them shut up and get out there.
02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:05.000 And, you know, hindsight, not the right thing to do because then they really don't know why they're doing.
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:14.000 What they're doing and then there's resentment that's building and then they're just not going to be the most effective at what they've got going on.
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000 No, man. I wish we could do this whole job over again.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:27.000 We kind of can, though. I mean, it goes back to the resentment thing and another bad art word is that regret.
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000 Yeah.
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:35.000 I've learned like all these dang mistakes I've made and every big setback that I've experienced in my life.
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:40.000 I feel like it's kind of set me up for success through moving forward.
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000 So it's kind of like glacier, you know, every time I've taken like a foot back, I then move forward.
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000 Yeah.
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000 I learned from it and press on.
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:57.000 What's interesting for me is as I look back at my career now and I was actually doing this when I was thinking about mistakes.
02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.000 Man, and I was actually talking to Dave Burke, the deal Dave.
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000 Yeah.
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:12.000 And like the things that I talked about all the time now, I did those things like when I was a between the manner.
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:19.000 I wasn't doing this stuff. I wasn't, I wasn't as crystallized, but like when I was a task commander, I was, this is what I was doing.
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:34.000 This is what I was doing. It wasn't like I had it crystallized. It wasn't like I had this like, oh, this is what I had seen enough and most of it I'd seen as you just said through modeling from some good officers and from some bad officers and some good chiefs and some bad chiefs.
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:43.000 Oh, that's all with that. I'm going to, hey, what does that guy do that? He always tells me what's going, okay, I'm going to always do that. You know, like that kind of thing.
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:50.000 But like you said, would you get done with a job? You look at him. You're like, man, let me just do that one more time because I will knock this thing out of the park.
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:59.000 So when is the moment do you think for you that you're the collective light bulb went off and you kind of put a lot of this together?
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:12.000 The collective well, you know, the first FTX is a trade-out when you got there and that was part of it. Like I like my assistant platoon commander in my OIC.
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:24.000 I was telling him this stuff, you know, I was like, hey man, here's what's going on. Like, hey, we need to do this. Hey, you, when you going and brief this guy, you need to be like this stuff. I was doing it.
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:33.000 But then the next deployment, it was like when I was, you know, when I was working with LaF and Seth, you know, it was me saying, hey man, come here.
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:47.000 And you know, those guys were whip out the freaking, the wheelbooks, you know, like after they realized what was going on, which was like three days into our, our task unit, maybe like hey.
02:12:47.000 --> 02:13:06.000 Check this out. It boom, they'd get out and they'd write down like, okay, this is what, okay, got it. Yes, that makes sense. And, but as far as actually taking it and crystallizing it, I was absolutely my first, the first FTX I went on with trade-out and watch the, watch the task unit out there, just fall apart.
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:17.000 And, and all I was doing was sitting there thinking, if this was my task unit, number one, here's what I'd be doing. And number two, when I got back, I'd be telling the platoon commander this, this and this.
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:29.000 I'd be telling those guys, hey, this is where you screwed up and I just was watching it and go, okay, here's, I basically condensed everything that I had told my guys and said, okay, here's what you guys need to do. And that was,
02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:36.000 cover move simple prioritizing, actually decentralized command, the answer is the soul, many, the answer is to all problems.
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:45.000 Boy, I'll down to four things and they all kind of overlap. Yeah, they definitely are intertwined and they overlap and you do have to throw extreme ownership on their only because,
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:54.000 if you don't take ownership of the problems, then they're not going to get solved and that is going to hurt you. So, yeah.
02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:09.000 At the, at the, at the, Mr. J. P. was saying some stuff that really stuck with me and he said it out at the, at the PT and he's like, hey, everybody, we get to be here.
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.000 This is an opportunity that you have to be here.
02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:27.000 And he said that and I thought, man, that is just an awesome perspective to have. I called him up yesterday and like, hey, I want to talk about this and, you know, just fill me on and on what your mind said is,
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:36.000 and he goes, yeah, he goes, you know, because when he was at buds, the way he looked at a four mile time run, which I hated four mile time runs.
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:49.000 Just, I'm throw up every four mile time run. His, his attitude was, I get to do this four mile time run. So, if you take that and you start applying that to everything.
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.000 Heck yeah, they just don't have, there's no room to bitch about a damn thing.
02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:05.000 You know, I moved through the airport today and I see a guy with no legs and I'm like, man, my life is so good, both my legs work.
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000 And I shouldn't, I shouldn't have a complaint in the world.
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:25.000 Yeah. One of the last thing and we're getting kind of like getting pretty long here, but, you know, one of the things I wanted you to talk about, and I know this isn't really, well, I guess it is, because as a leader of your family,
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:39.000 I know that we, we have to, we have to lead our family, right? And one of you, you posted something the other day that was for legit, I think it was called a promise to my daughter.
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:54.000 And I was, I just asked if you could bring it in because I think if you, if you don't mind reading that, to everyone, I think it's a pretty cool set up of how to take ownership of your family and how to, how to, what you, what you, as a leader,
02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:12.000 and as a dad, and as a father, and as a husband, what you are putting forth as your goal, as your objective, as your strategy with your daughter. And I thought it was pretty awesome. So if you would mind reading that, that'd be cool.
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:23.000 Absolutely. A promise to my daughter. I will love you always unconditionally, no matter what.
02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:32.000 I will not pamper you. This will forge a resilience that will help you conquer all of life's obstacles.
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:42.000 I do not entail intent to raise a princess, but rather a warrior, with fire, inner heart, and ice and her veins.
02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:49.000 In my mind, there is nothing you can't do. No job or goal beyond your reach.
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:55.000 I will challenge you so that you stand confidently on your own to feet.
02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:03.000 And I will set the example on how to treat those you love, so that when you choose a partner, it will be someone that lifts you up.
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:14.000 I will invest my time and energy in you so that when I am gone, enough memories of me will be with you in your heart to keep forever.
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:21.000 Stand tall with your shoulders back. This world is yours for the taking.
02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000 Boom. Yeah, that's awesome, man.
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000 And obviously I would think the same stuff for my son. Yeah, yeah.
02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:38.000 But well, you'll have to write one a little bit specific to him. Very similar.
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:51.000 Yeah, that's awesome. That's really going on. A, listen to it, and B, play, jirize it, and you know, absolutely.
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000 Yeah, for their own family.
02:17:54.000 --> 02:18:00.000 But no, that's awesome, man. And like I said, we're going pretty long right now.
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:11.000 So I think that's a good place to wrap up this one. What is this now? We've done something like seven or eight hours, seven or eight hours. Awesome.
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:26.000 So echo speaking of having a strategy to get to where we want to go to be a little bit better across the board in all aspects.
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000 What do you got for us? Got some tips. Oh, by the way, yeah, I read that on Instagram. If I'm not mistaken.
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000 And I considered plagiarizing it. Please do.
02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:40.000 My daughter. Now I got the confirmation or what do you guys call it? Clear. Clear hot.
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000 Yeah, clear hot.
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:48.000 There you go. And you were right about the two face things when you said, let me guess what you're going to say.
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000 Oh, you're actually 100%. Cool. Yeah, like act one way.
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000 Hey, boss. Hey, you know, hate some. Hey, you're awesome. You're awesome. You're awesome. And then right when he leaves, then, you know, you see, that guy's actually.
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000 Yeah, yeah, so yeah, good.
02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000 Yeah, good.
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000 Yes, we're on the path. Okay. Good.
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:15.000 Strategic versus tactical. Long game short game. I know you've been in a long game.
02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:35.000 Pictures, small picture, all the same thing when people ask echo. What's like the big takeaway. I think that's it's primary takeaway is focusing on the long game, which he's a football. So, you know, he likes things the game thing or super Mario Brothers. Sure.
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000 Moreover, please. But you know, as opposed to thinking short game. Yeah.
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:47.000 If you look at your life every day, in long game slash strategic instead of short game slash tactical, you're going to end up in a better spot. Yeah.
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000 And when I say the biggest, I mean, that's the one that applies to like the whole life.
02:19:52.000 --> 02:20:01.000 There's the other stuff. No complaining. That one was a big one. No complaining. No blaming, of course. And then, um, resent.
02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:18.000 And I never had the resent faint. The jealousy thing. That's something I've never really had to do. Yeah. That one to me always felt obvious when I when I discovered like anger, like when you're mad, that's like something up with you kind of thing.
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000 You know, it's natural. Whatever.
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:36.000 That's one of the biggest, one of the biggest things I got from doing this podcast is Captain Plum saying when they were in the in the Hanoi Hill and him saying, if you were annoyed with your prison bunkmate, it was your fault.
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000 It was like hit me like a diamond bullet. Yeah.
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:55.000 Between the eyes. That was extreme ownership. Next level. Yeah. Cause always annoyed with that other person. You know, actually, you know what? That's my fault. Yeah. Yeah. That was good. When I when I discovered it was a book, I was reading called mind games. I mentioned it before.
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:07.000 And it said small little passage said basically, um, in a nutshell, like when you have anger issues, not to say when you get mad, but just as if you have anger issues, it has something to do with your self esteem.
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:19.000 Like you have low self esteem. And that hit me really hard. Like, oh man, that hit me so hard that I was like, man, I can never get mad ever again. That's like a reverse psychology on your ego because in your ego is going on.
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:28.000 I got to turn myself down because I got low self esteem here. Oh, yes, genius. Same thing with the drinking now you put it into words good where kids will drink in right.
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:38.000 I ended up figuring out or it being revealed to me that, like when you drink when you have a drink, you want another one and you want another one and you're mind and the more you have the more you sort of want, you can't really stop or whatever you don't want to stop.
02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:46.000 It's just your brain tricking you. You know, it's your brain tricking like your brain is chemically saying, oh, we need this. Hey, we need this. You know, we need more or whatever.
02:21:46.000 --> 02:22:02.000 You're going to feel like you were getting manipulated. I felt like I was a sucker as you said and like he wasn't whoa whoa whoa whoa, I'm not a sucker. I don't care if it's my own brain. I'm not a sucker or whatever. And it was just that easy man. That is to control it. But yes, it is a reverse psychology on your ego.
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:14.000 Good as opposed to regular psychology on your ego short term and long term. Do you get to right. Yeah, I think you're going to use to read the word reverse reversal.
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:23.000 That's that's what you're going to handle the transition negative negative. I'm saying I'm on the first long game and short game. Do you choose one of those long game short game.
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:33.000 The situations 100% part of the path part of the many activities that we're all doing on the path Jason Gardner got into good shape obviously.
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:41.000 So we're exercising do you get to reading healthy we're not getting mad at people we're not showing resentment. We're not complaining.
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:57.000 Very so things that will go over anyway, you just what you do just so you could need a key what get we get origin. You get it from origin main dot com this is where all their stuff, by the way, is made all in America from the cotton they grow from the ground all the way to the end.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:43.000 I don't have anybody that those are the breaks and that's just the life I live also.
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000 If sweatpants and shirts and whatnot, other stuff on there's also supplement supplements the best kind of supplements by the way.
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:58.000 Yeah, there was some there was some people freaking out on the strawberry star if you tried strawberry star yet.
02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:06.000 Yeah, that's just not me. Oh, you don't. I'm not not that kind of strawberry guy. I definitely got some and tried it and work.
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:13.000 I'm a hardcore men chocolate chip and then the vanilla for me. Yeah, you get that vanilla gorilla and throw it inside your coffee.
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:23.000 Yeah, that's your sweetener kind of that's your eating sugar. Yeah, boom. Yeah, that's good method and then that's Iris is mixing that in everything.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:37.000 Like right after I pee tea and then how when you feel hungry for your next meal. Oh, I don't eat until like one 200 to a clock.
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:44.000 So just that and I was just putting it in everything. She's making milk. Yeah, she's making milk.
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000 Can we can smooth these and all that stuff so we go through quite a bit of milk in our house. Yeah, and the kids love it.
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.000 Yeah, that strawberry can make like it's like a milkshake smoothie hybrid.
02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000 Here's what I said the other day.
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000 If you put in front of me.
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:15.000 Hagen does strawberry milkshake, right? Yes, sure. Nestle's strawberry quick and strawberry slayer milk and I was going to die in 15 minutes.
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000 So we're just going pure satisfaction.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.000 Sure, sure. Sure, sure.
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:26.000 The long game is out of the picture. I'm going straight to the strawberries. They are milk because that's what tastes the best.
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.000 That is the taste test. Right, no one does the taste test. Like that.
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:36.000 I'm going to throw some coffee on there but the Hagen dance is going to be sugary or the nesties quick is going to give you a sugar. No.
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:46.000 We're taking the long game totally out of the picture. We're going pure short term tactical taste where you at strawberry slayer break it.
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.000 The name's awesome, too. Yeah, we're you know.
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000 I'll still join more for you.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:16.000 I have to pull out the list. It's so funny. Everything is random military terms.
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:28.000 But yeah, don't catch Pete. He gets into these moods. Create. He has just coming out of his coming out of his brain and he'll start hitting me up with text about strawberry sniper.
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000 Yeah, I'm not that man. It's from the snap that man. He had some ones that are.
02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000 But slayer is better. I'm used to slayer. So when he has snipe her, I'm like, oh, I see why that was like a distant second one.
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:41.000 I try to think of some of the other whack ones. It's because it's already peered.
02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:51.000 Yeah, some of them were real funny. Actually, I texted him. He texted Brian in me. He texted us all these names. And I was like, okay, stop. No, for part.
02:26:51.000 --> 02:27:00.000 He just started laughing. Yeah, so check that. He probably had a, he had a, he had a, probably had a little too much discipline. Go. Yeah, potential. Yeah.
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000 Yeah. How many discipline go are you on right now? Four.
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000 Daily. No, per day. Yeah.
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000 It's just because I had to get up at three a.m. Oh, right. I wanted to be a person. What time did you go to bed at?
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:19.000 What 10, 10 p.m. So you're on five hours as lead bread. Did you sleep on the plane? No. Can you sleep on planes? Yes. I can see sometimes I can't.
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:27.000 But I was, I was just writing all these notes and you were ready for this. And sometimes I can just turn it off. But I wasn't able to sleep on the plane.
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000 I can sleep on planes not as well as echo though echo gets the world champion to belt.
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:42.000 We're going to play. We're going to play with them within within 38 seconds. He's asleep. He looks he puts his sunglasses on. He looks like he's awake.
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.000 But it's a lie.
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000 So yeah, so just to be a good situation. I take two every morning.
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.000 Check. So get up in the morning to discipline go and then join warfare.
02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000 Take a morning and night. Yeah. And I notice a do. How many do you take?
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000 Take a two in the morning and two at night and then. And what's your body weight right now?
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000 One, sixty something like that. I take three. I take three.
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000 Join warfare. Three curalloyal morning. Three.
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000 Three curalloyal night. If I got a little.
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000 A little situation going on tonight might if I'm around. I'll take three during the day for lunch time.
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000 Two.
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000 So you just got the infusion infusion.
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000 Infusion.
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000 So that's that. Yeah. Don't worry about the warrior kid moke to for the warrior kids.
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000 Yeah. Well, so all right. Well, let's let's talk about it.
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000 And what's what in your opinion, or he could moke strawberry or strawberry slayer?
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000 Strawberry slayer is thicker. It's like a shake.
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:50.000 Yeah. I think actually I think the way that they are they are actually suitable for their audience.
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000 So that's the strawberry.
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000 The warrior kid strawberry moke is just a little bit a little bit lighter.
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000 We'll say because it does have less protein.
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000 And the one the adult one is a little bit heavier.
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.000 Good. A little bit more like that hog and nose hitter.
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000 Yeah.
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000 Just like that.
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000 Where you at Theo Vaughn with that hitter.
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.000 Oh, so also juggle white tea. Yes.
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000 Very, very fra... I'm going to say the light, the nice stuff about it.
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000 Very refreshing certified organic pomegranate white tea.
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000 Doesn't sound hardcore. But he can have to dead lifting 8,000 pounds.
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000 That is kind of hardcore. Yeah.
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000 Proving by the way, chasing burden. Signed, typically.
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000 Yeah. You know all about that.
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000 You know what I'm talking about.
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000 100% guarantee.
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000 Can I get sued for that?
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000 You know?
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000 Maybe I guess if there was someone that couldn't hit it 8,000 pound deadlift, then they might come at me.
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:44.000 Yeah.
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000 Come at me, bro.
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000 I'll change it.
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000 You know what I'll say, lift harder.
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000 Yeah, man.
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000 Drink more.
02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000 I'll just change it.
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000 Because there's no way everyone else is deadlifting 8,000 pounds.
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:53.000 What's wrong with you?
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000 Good guy, yep.
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000 Yeah.
02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:55.000 Yeah.
02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.000 Make sense.
02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000 Also, we have a store called Jocco Store.
02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000 I think we all know that.
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:02.000 This is where you can get rash guards.
02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000 Tea shirts.
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000 You're going to represent this Blin equals freedom.
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.000 Oh, so I'm like, is the trucker's hats?
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000 Beenies.
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000 Some beenies there.
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000 Man, I got to refill the beenies.
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:13.000 Oh, thanks.
02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000 Maybe you don't have beenies there.
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.000 It's good.
02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000 Welcome, never wears hats.
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000 So these apparently are no on the pro.
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000 Have you even even had a cold head before?
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000 Yeah, I haven't had a cold head before.
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.000 Sure.
02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000 But I've been.
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.000 Well, depends on what you mean by cold, but, you know, yeah, you put the
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000 thing on, you know, put that like, like, you know, you just put the coldness on the
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.000 head.
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000 Yeah, man, right when you shave it like with the, what do you call the razor?
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:37.000 No, no.
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000 They say when you big your head, that's what that's an expression.
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000 Oh, yeah, I can get a little lip.
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000 I guess, kind of cold.
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000 Well, anyways, the rest of us would like some more beenies online.
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000 Yes, sir.
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000 You got it.
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000 And for the summertime.
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000 Yes, sir.
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000 Because if you're up in Maine in the summertime, or you're up in Michigan in the summertime,
02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:01.000 or you're up in Washington in the summertime, once the sun goes down, you can get that little chilly.
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000 Yeah.
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000 Yeah.
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000 Yeah, I agree.
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000 And that's how it is here too, in my opinion.
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000 And you might as well have a beenie that says,
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000 discipline equals freedom.
02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000 Yeah, man, represent with everything.
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:15.000 Also, the hoodies, like I mentioned, lightweight hoodies.
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000 Jason, guys, you were done at the mustard.
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000 It looked good, right?
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000 Not bad.
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000 Well, thank you.
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000 Oh, now we're on the however one looks at it.
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000 Well, well, it's part of the game.
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000 It can be part of maybe not for you aesthetics.
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000 Why is right?
02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.000 We got functionality.
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000 We have aesthetics.
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000 They're not exclusive.
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.000 Yeah, and you remember I was asking you about the heavy weights, because that's what I,
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:38.000 but that's what I need up in Northeastern Washington, on Canadian border.
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:44.000 We are working currently at this time, so that by the time fall walls, it rolls around.
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000 We offer the heaviest of heavy weight hoodies.
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000 Yeah, that's the plan.
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000 Yes.
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000 I'm talking big done.
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000 The real deal.
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000 Yeah.
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000 There'll be no doubt in your mind, but oh, yeah, this is the heaviest hoodie I've ever heard.
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000 We had put non-five pounds.
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000 Yeah, that's what we want.
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000 That's what we want.
02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000 That's what we want.
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:06.000 But aesthetics, how let's say a factor of 10 is function.
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000 I don't have to answer this question, Jason.
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000 You need level 10 functionality, obviously.
02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:14.000 Is that x, what are we, what are you at, what number?
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000 A 7.
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000 That's pretty significant.
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000 What are you at?
02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000 Zero.
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:19.000 Zero.
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000 Straight up zero.
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000 There's a light light.
02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000 The light weight, anything having to do with fashion.
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000 I think you're at a 1.
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000 That's what I think.
02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000 Yeah, no, if there are some things where I'd be like, this looks stupid.
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000 Therefore, I will not wear it.
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000 So we are correct.
02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000 That puts me on a level 1.
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000 All right.
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000 Well, how about this?
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000 You got three, four t-shirts.
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:50.000 One green, like green, not owed D green, green green, one red, one black,
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000 one purple, which one each using?
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000 Why?
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000 Looks better, right?
02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000 Doesn't get dirty as easy.
02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000 No, man.
02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000 Oh, I'm just trying to...
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000 Anyway, that punk car.
02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000 It was that pulled boy.
02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000 Anyway, some women's stuff on there too,
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000 it is jocquistord.com. This is where you can get stuff to represent.
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000 Yeah, check it out.
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000 Like something, get something.
02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000 Did you say originmain.com?
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000 Yes.
02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.000 That's for the words somebody does.
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000 I want something that strawberry...
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000 That's that ear.
02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:21.000 Of course, man.
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000 Of course.
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000 Yes.
02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000 Also, strawberries.
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000 They are snapping like a theme.
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000 Like what you say, it should be like in the background.
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000 It should go strawberry.
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000 Snorke.
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000 Got a double-based, wrong hammer.
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000 Yeah, I'm learning.
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000 You can do, you can do, you can do, you can do.
02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.000 Yeah, I don't know if I agree with that.
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000 But, you know, it should be a good name for sure.
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000 100% also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes,
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000 and wherever you get your podcasts.
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000 And don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast,
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000 which comes out not as frequently as it should.
02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:58.000 It should step up this summer as time opens up
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000 to create and record that particular podcast.
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000 Yeah, and then you can get some of that Warrior Kid soap.
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000 Your friends with Matt, right?
02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.000 Mm-hmm.
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:09.000 Yeah.
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000 Up there, Aiden, making it on his farm.
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000 Irish Oaks.
02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000 Yeah, Irish Oaks, Rants.com.
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000 How do you know him?

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000 Yeah, we were going to buy meat from him.
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000 And then when he came to deliver it to you,
02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000 he swung by and visited us.
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000 I was going that day, so I didn't meet him.
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.000 But him and I have chatted on the phone a whole bunch of times.
02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000 Awesome.
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000 Yeah, he's a firefighter up enough at your county.
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000 And he's got a farm as well.
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000 And his son, Aiden, was a young Warrior Kid,
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.000 makes soap so that everyone in the world can stay clean.
02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000 Yep.
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000 Cool.
02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000 That's good soap, too, by the way.
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000 Yeah.
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000 The functional soap.
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000 It's not the decorative.
02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000 You know the one that you'll meet makes.
02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000 And it's like here.
02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000 It's not even supposed to really use it.
02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000 Yeah, it's a decoration.
02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000 Like if you will.
02:34:58.000 --> 02:34:59.000 Mm-hmm.
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000 Yes, also.
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000 We have a YouTube channel.
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000 The chocolate podcast YouTube channel is where you can get the video version.
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000 Of course.
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000 You want to see what Jason looks like.
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000 Right?
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000 Handsome.
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000 Look at you.
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000 That's it.
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000 But it'll jocco.
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000 What?
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000 Just take it easy.
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000 Amen.
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000 Either way, if you're interested in that,
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000 we have a YouTube channel.
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000 Also some excerpts on there.
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000 You know, we'll cut up little excerpts.
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.000 And sometimes Echo puts shallow music behind him.
02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000 And he puts explosions in him.
02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000 Yeah, sometimes.
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000 When I want to enhance him, maybe like a certain message that you talk about hits me hard.
02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000 I say, hey, let me express this, you know, put some stuff on there.
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000 Do you ever feel like maybe we should just get a couple of shallow players in here?
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.000 No, I don't.
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000 I don't ever feel like that at all.
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000 And you know, I think we should stick with what we're doing.
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000 That's my opinion.
02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000 Here's the thing about YouTube though.
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000 As far as uh, subscribing.
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000 Yeah.
02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:54.000 So it doesn't even matter.
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000 And you might notice, Jay, do you spend time on YouTube?
02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000 Yes, like, okay.
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000 So here's what I learned and observed.
02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000 If you subscribe to someone in YouTube, it doesn't matter that much.
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000 Like, their stuff won't show up all the time.
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000 Like how you would expect, you'd think like, if you subscribe,
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000 their stuff is going to sort of show up on your way to call it the home.
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000 Yeah, page or whatever.
02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000 Doesn't so much do that in you.
02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000 But I get an email every time you post something new.
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000 Okay.
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000 Now you're talking because when you subscribe to someone and you do that additional step,
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000 you click on the little bell.
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000 I think it's like right next to or on the subscribe button or wherever it is right there.
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000 If you do that, then you'll get the alert email.
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.000 You know, my alerts actually come onto my phone.
02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000 They like, spring up that from YouTube or for your job.
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000 You know, podcast just posted a new video.
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.000 That's from my, from the app from the YouTube app from the YouTube app.
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000 Yes.
02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.000 Which is pretty cool.
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000 Yeah.
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:49.000 Yeah.
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000 So if you want that, this is what I'm saying.
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000 So when you subscribe, it's almost like a half subscribed.
02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000 Not even a half.
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000 It's like a quarter subscribed.
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000 That's what it is because you're kind of sort of like,
02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000 Oh, yeah, I officially sort of subscribe, but YouTube, like cool.
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000 Okay.
02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000 I think we're not going to let you know.
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000 We want to subscribe.
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000 This is way different.
02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000 This is different.
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:11.000 I'm saying if you want to subscribe and you want to get alerts and you want it to sort of be in your,
02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:14.000 what do you call it, the feed or whatever you got the little bell.
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000 This is what I'm worried about.
02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000 I'm worried about since you're very decentralized, since there's a lot of decentralized command here.
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000 Yes.
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:30.000 I'm worried that if people don't subscribe, all of a sudden you're just going to start putting the little thing at the end of your enhanced videos that says that says,
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000 like she likes.
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.000 Like she likes.
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000 Like she shows the little finger click subscribe and if that happens,
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000 we're going to have a problem.
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000 Yes.
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000 The videos make it decentralized real quick.
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000 Real quick.
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000 Well, we're not going to worry about that because I agree with you.
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:49.000 100% like subscribe.
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000 Yeah.
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.000 Maybe before you watch this video, go down to the bottom right click subscribe now.
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000 I'm sure this is not going to be annoying.
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000 I hate it when I see that.
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:00.000 Yeah.
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000 But I'm sure there's some function.
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.000 What's the equivalent of when you meet someone?
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000 Like what's the equivalent of a human interaction?
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:08.000 Where you say that?
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.000 We're going to be like somebody dropping the S bomb.
02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.000 Would it be like, yeah, that.
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000 But would you like, like, hey, good to meet you.
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000 Can I have a pat on the back please?
02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000 Like isn't that basically what it is?
02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:18.000 That's the human interaction equivalent.
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000 Yeah.
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000 Like, okay, nice to meet you.
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000 Give me your phone and I'm going to index.
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.000 I'm going to put my phone over and there.
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.000 So I can text you what I'm doing all the time.
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000 Yeah.
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000 Give me a pat on the back.
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000 All right, sorry.
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000 No, I might think of that.
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.000 That's actually a little an analogical analog analogy.
02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:42.000 Like comparison task.
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000 Think find the analogies.
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000 What I'm saying.
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000 Psychological warfare.
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000 iTunes Google Play and B3 platforms.
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.000 If you want to, if you want to wake up call, which a lot of people say,
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000 Can't you make an alarm?
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000 Can't you make an alarm?
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000 Can't you make an alarm?
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000 Yes, you can use psychological warfare as an alarm.
02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000 There's a bunch of alarm options there.
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000 There's also something on there.
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000 If you're feeling like you want to eat a donut or you want to eat a bag of cheetos,
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000 yeah, when it's lost to me, you ate a bag of cheetos.
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000 One time I ate a whole bag of Hershey's kisses.
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000 And this is when I was in the teams.
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000 I'm talking to a grown man.
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000 How big was it back?
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000 Like a good size.
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000 Like the size of a book.
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000 It was one of those.
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000 Yeah, it was like six years ago.
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.000 My mom came over to my house and put a whole bag of candy corn.
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000 It was around Halloween.
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000 And every time I walked by it,
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000 I was stuffed with things in my mouth.
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000 And pretty soon they're all gone.
02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000 You like candy corn?
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000 They're good.
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000 At the sense, I bet I couldn't eat one right now because I,
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000 You know, kind of cut sweet stuff out.
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000 And every time I slip, I taste something and like,
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000 Holy cow.
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000 The thing I noticed that is with Coca-Cola.
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000 Like I can't even,
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000 I can't even come close to drinking a Coca-Cola.
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000 I'm an admin at one legit like,
02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000 I'm an avococcan probably 10 or 15 years or something.
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000 A long time.
02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:56.000 I don't even have a long time.
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:56.000 Yeah.
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000 I don't even have a long time.
02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000 But when I look at them or like the last time I tried to sip one,
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000 I was like, you know,
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:04.000 Yeah.
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.000 They're like syrup.
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:05.000 Yeah.
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:06.000 So anyways.
02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000 Yeah.
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:07.000 Makes sense.
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000 Like see that.
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000 Like you drink.
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:09.000 Yeah.
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000 So that's like a lot of warfare.
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000 You can get that on any of those platforms.
02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000 Also flip side canvass.com.
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000 If you want,
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000 if you want the visual.
02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000 Remind or something.
02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.000 My brother Dakota Meyer has a company called FlipsideCampus.com.
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000 And he's making all kinds of cool stuff.
02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.000 He's about to run out some warrior kid stuff too.
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000 Some little warrior kid.
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000 I like his teddy rose of elves stuff.
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:32.000 Yeah.
02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000 He's all the after it.
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000 Yeah.
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000 So he's making some really cool stuff.
02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:37.000 Art.
02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:38.000 Art with layers.
02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.000 Art with layers.
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:40.000 There you go.
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000 I like that.
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000 You know, also on it.
02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000 You're expanding your home gym.
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000 You get a more kettlebells, which I did by the way.
02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000 Darth Vader.
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000 How much is it?
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000 70.
02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000 Okay.
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000 He's the thing about the 70 pound.
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.000 Like sure, I'm not, you know, I'm going to be more impressed with your
02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000 100 pound kettlebell that you were whatever.
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000 Bragging to me about 106.
02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000 What a stay you go.
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000 There you go.
02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:02.000 106.
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:05.000 But the 70 and the 72, the gorilla,
02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.000 want to whatever those in my opinion have the most like play.
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000 Universal use.
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:09.000 Yeah.
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000 Universal use.
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:10.000 Yeah.
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000 Yeah.
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000 That's a great.
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000 Plus the Darth Vader.
02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000 I mean, come on.
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000 That's the ultimate one.
02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000 I think.
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.000 But they should, they should have made the Darth Vader like a
02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.000 100 at least over 100 pounds in my opinion.
02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000 Jason, you're the Star Wars expert.
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.000 Yeah.
02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000 He should definitely be the heaviest.
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000 Who's the most powerful character in Star Wars?
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000 Darth Vader.
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000 This is, this is one.
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000 He's kind of a Trump some more.
02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000 No, negative.
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000 No.
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000 You think the Emperor may be, but it's Darth Vader.
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000 Darth Vader.
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000 You're about to get out of the house.
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.000 I mean, I don't know.
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000 You know, Darth Maul was pretty dang badass too.
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000 No, I mean, he's like the dead chopped up pretty quick.
02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000 But I mean, Darth Vader lost.
02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000 Darth Vader lost to Luke Skywalker.
02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.000 Who crumbled immediately by the way.
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000 Yeah.
02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000 Later on.
02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:02.000 So it's Darth Vader, man.
02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:03.000 I think it's Darth Vader.
02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:04.000 Yeah.
02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000 I like Vader.
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:06.000 Mm.
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:07.000 I'm the last.
02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:11.000 The real leader lifts people up. You ever see that meme and Darth Vader's holding.
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000 That rebel guy up like that.
02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000 There you go.
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000 He really needs to lift me up.
02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000 That is so funny.
02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000 But Darth Vader went through the whole arc.
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000 He was good.
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000 Bad.
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000 Good.
02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:24.000 Boom.
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:25.000 You know, I don't think he knew well.
02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:26.000 I'm sure he's the dog.
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000 Nonetheless, yes, I got that kettlebell.
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000 There's a lot of good stuff.
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:33.000 There's these electrolyte minerals that are part of my daily daily
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:38.000 main domains with the discipline.
02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000 And the last going there on it.
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:43.000 Com slash jacco and check out some stuff on there.
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000 Really good stuff on there.
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:46.000 All right.
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000 Some books weigh the warrior kid free.
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000 The book is called Where There's a Will.
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000 There's a good message.
02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000 Talk about it already.
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000 Check that one out.
02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000 It is available now.
02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:59.000 Also weigh the warrior kid at one end to marks mission is two.
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000 Number one is weigh the warrior kid.
02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.000 Check those out for your kid to teach your kid these lessons.
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:12.000 The jacan I just talked about for two plus hours are broken down, simplified and
02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000 and sprinkled, sprinkled throughout these books.
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.000 So that your kid is going to read on your kid is going to say things to you.
02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000 Like dad.
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.000 I think that might be your ego talk.
02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.000 That's the idea of ego gets introduced in way the warrior could free.
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:34.000 That's where it gets introduced for the first time.
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000 So why?
02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000 Because I wish somebody would have told me about my ego.
02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000 I wish somebody would have explained to me that I was resentful.
02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000 I was jealous.
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000 I was whining.
02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.000 No one did.
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000 Or if my dad did, I didn't listen because I was a young punk.
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000 So get those books.
02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.000 Also if you got a younger kid, you can get Mikey in the dragons as well.
02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000 Which again, this is the thing where your kid gets taught a lesson.
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000 Hey, I didn't listen to my dad.
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000 I didn't listen to my mom.
02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000 Jason didn't listen to his mom.
02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000 Jason didn't listen to his dad.
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:22.000 I've been sitting around with a bunch of real, really squared way people, business people.
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000 And we start talking about kids.
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000 And then I say, hey, wait a second.
02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000 Who here listen to their parents?
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000 No one raises their hands.
02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000 Very few.
02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.000 There's the one occasional two occasional eddie hascles.
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:37.000 Whatever.
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000 Yeah.
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.000 I always listen to my parents.
02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:40.000 No, you didn't.
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.000 Most, most, but what happens is when they hear it from another angle, they listen to it and they go,
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000 oh, okay, I understand that.
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000 And they think it's cool.
02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000 It's Uncle Jake say it.
02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:51.000 It's not my dad.
02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.000 Because your kids want to rebel against you because they know they have to leave the nest.
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000 So they got to set up some kind of a barrier.
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000 So they need someone to give them advice, but that's someone be Uncle Jake.
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000 Let that someone be the king in Mikey and the dragons.
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000 So there you go.
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:07.000 That's that.
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.000 Also, we got obviously discipline and concrete.
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000 Field manual.
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000 If you're an adult, you need to know how to get them a path and stay on the path.
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000 Get that book and put it by your bedside and read that.
02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000 Read a page in the morning.
02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000 Have you ever had a book that will get you out of bed?
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:24.000 No.
02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.000 No. Okay, discipline. It was for your field manual. Put it next to your bed.
02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.000 Yeah.
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000 You'll be like, I'm getting out of bed.
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000 I'm going to go get some.
02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000 So then there's extreme ownership in the economy.
02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000 Leadership. He's there.
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000 Books about leadership.
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000 Written by me in my brother, Lave.
02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.000 Babin.
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000 About the lessons that we learned overseas.
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:45.000 Now you can apply them in your team, in your business, in your life.
02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000 Also, we got Ashlon front.
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000 Leadership consultancy.
02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000 And we're very busy.
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:59.000 We're very busy because no matter what problem you have in your team, in your business,
02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:02.000 the problem is a leadership problem.
02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.000 And if you want to get it solved, you got to solve the leadership, the leadership problems
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000 that you have.
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000 And if you can do that, then you're going to solve the problems in your company.
02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000 So it's me.
02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000 It's Lave Babin.
02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.000 J.P. D'Neill.
02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.000 Dave Burke.
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:18.000 Flynn Cochran.
02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000 Mike Surrely.
02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:20.000 Mike Bhima.
02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000 Jason Gardner.
02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:28.000 If you want us to help you, go to shalomfront.com for details.
02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000 We got the master.
02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.000 Chicago's done.
02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.000 Did it sell out?
02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000 Yes, it did.
02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000 How'd you like the master?
02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000 As your first master, Jason, how'd you like it?
02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000 Wow.
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.000 That was amazing.
02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000 Don't you wish you got to go to that when you were 25 years old?
02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000 Yeah, it was a year old.
02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000 I was super impressed by there were people that had their kids there.
02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:49.000 Yeah.
02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.000 Yeah.
02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000 That's not normal, right?
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000 I mean, when you say there was people, there was probably.
02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000 Okay.
02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.000 And by kids, I'm talking to them.
02:46:58.000 --> 02:46:59.000 There was one 13 year old there.
02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.000 Yeah.
02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:04.000 But there was quite a few teenagers and high school age.
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:05.000 Yeah.
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.000 Yeah.
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000 I would say 16 to 21.
02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.000 There would be a good amount.
02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:12.000 Maybe it doesn't.
02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:13.000 Yeah.
02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000 And then, but there's the other was 113 year old.
02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:18.000 The warrior kid that was just straight getting after it.
02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:19.000 But that's not really the most important.
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:20.000 Yeah.
02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000 Yeah.
02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.000 Yeah.
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000 You can imagine that warrior kid, Rauchkar, if you want to get that.
02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000 Yeah.
02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000 That's the master.
02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:31.000 They always sell out the next one is in Denver.
02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.000 It's 19th and 20th of September.
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:41.000 And it's going to sell out Sydney, Australia, December 4th and 5th.
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000 It's going to sell out.
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000 We got people in Australia.
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.000 Yes, we do.
02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:49.000 When I went to Brizzy, there was people from all over Australia coming to hang out.
02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000 Oh, yeah.
02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000 Home of David Hacquire, Brisbane.
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000 That's very moved.
02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000 Take it.
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000 Yeah.
02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000 And if you want to come to that code, extremotorship.com.
02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000 Get on it early.
02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.000 EF online.
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.000 If you can't come to the master or you can't bring your entire company the
02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.000 master because the master is expensive.
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.000 Then get go to EF online.com.
02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000 And what that is, it's leadership training.
02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000 But the thing is leadership training is not an inoculation.
02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000 You can't just go to leadership training one time and then you're like, oh, cool.
02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000 I got extreme ownership.
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000 Now I'm good to go.
02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.000 It doesn't work like that.
02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.000 Just like you can't go to one GJT class or even one week's worth of GJT class.
02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000 You can't go to a two day GJT seminar.
02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000 Now you're good to go.
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.000 No.
02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.000 You need to keep training.
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000 And that's what happens here as well.
02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000 So it's not an inoculation.
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000 You got to get it repeatedly.
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000 And that's what EF online does.
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000 Or if you can't make it to the master.
02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:48.000 Go to EF online.com and also EF Overwatch.
02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:57.000 Taking proven leaders from spec ops and combat aviation and putting them in companies in the civilian sector that need leaders.
02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.000 Now you might think, well, they don't have any experience in my industry.
02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.000 Cool.
02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000 They'll learn it.
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000 That's what we do.
02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.000 Higher for their character, higher for their leadership capability and then teach them the industry specifics.
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000 They'll pick up and they will fill in the leadership holes that are causing you problems.
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:22.000 And if you want to hear more about 90s TV shows or super Mario Brothers from Echo.
