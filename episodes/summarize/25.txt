Oh, you know, whatever, I'd be like hey, you want you to think about it You know remember when you made like for doing making that shot and you missed or whatever like trying visualized Trying to think about what you did you know there's a lot of steps that go into pulling the trigger, you know, and and and then you know Just think about that think about how it happened and and Encourage that you know, I'm I'm a big fan of Meditation and yoga and all that stuff like If any and like I think and our Side of the world we've lost a lot of that stuff so do you do you find you get Because you you know we I don't want to hash out too much, but like your podcast went from non-existent to number one and about like Six days something crazy like that like you you left the Joe Rogan podcast Did you did started your own hit number one and like now like do you get too much correspondence like how do you keep up like I've noticed you are your like you must make Twitter a daily pass. I'm gonna learn as much as I possibly can so you got a long-term mission with your constituents right to be the best City councilman and Represent so when they ask you a question you're like boom that's kind of the course psychos tough that I would say is like if anybody ever asked me a question Like when I was gonna college if I asked me any question about it either reading I'm gonna know it That's just the bizarre What's that OCD thing to be like I'm gonna know everything so you have four kids you train every day You get up at four in the morning. I'm not I'm a I'm a Weekend soft and do stupid things you know, I mean don't put me on a pedestal But put yourself on a pedestal you know put yourself on a pedestal and rise up Your self don't worry about me springboard off my back and go to a higher level That's what I want to see happen that's what I don't want I don't want people to put me on a pedestal I want them to stand on my shoulders and go higher and further than anything I could ever do That's what I like did it take you this is a personal question on my end to take you while to say Like when somebody would say you inspire me and and thank you for being who you are Did you accept that at first or did you have to tell them like don't know they I guess I was doing my best to help the cop a traffic and and stuff like this and And deal with some of the other like minor injuries and The fireman like the first guy to put his head in he's like I kind of heard like well, who is this and then Alo here is Lanna like I need this Yeah, you know That's one of the things that makes that transition so hard Is that you know before I was talking about like combat matters and Then beyond that you're doing this thing You know for your wife like she's in charge of saving people's lives Saving soldiers lives and that's gonna help the strategic mission. and I know we try to get it back and got people that do it are Tree hugging you know, Spandex wearing weirdos or whatever, but yoga and Meditation and stuff like that's all warrior culture from the past You know like samurai meditate You know, eight warrior monks Fasted and prayed that's just meditation and they looked inside themselves a lot to try But yeah, like could you imagine though that's your gig well like we had an embedded EOD guys with us and See what usually have EOD Navy EOD guys right basically like two guys our guys were like they go through our training with us and Suddenly it was an issue for our guys as well Almost every vehicle we had hit a landmine on my tour and that was the only time I was ever really scared over there When I was walking or an helicopter or even out on a four wheeler No problem when I had to drive on the roads in a vehicle That's when I was like my that pucker factor was the highest for me ever IED man like the guys I would go out every day and deal with that shit like IED clearance guys fox man like My hat always came off to those guys. I'm like why is there sugar in the bread and and Like I'll be I'm not I'm like an 80 20 guy whatever that you know the 80% like 80% of time I pretty good 20% of the time. yeah the one One thing that I that's actually a pro I like a really practical thing that I did That in that is I had This again, this is just like a real practical thing I had two cuts Right, it's up to the cot something one caught Something one caught the other caught was all my gear and it was just laid out gun body armor, you know everything was right there and when I When I got dressed to go out All that thing was empty and so Never forgot anything when I came back everything went right back on the cot Same spot everything squared away This is what matters and how you gonna tell yourself that this is what matters It's because this is how it connects to the strategic picture You can't say that this matters because of what it is right in front of me just like when you're looking at the crossroads You're not thinking oh this crossroads is important because the crossroads is Important no the car the reason it's important is because you are supporting keeping guys alive Which is gonna help a mission out which is gonna help the the overall strategy win Commanders intent the commanders intent the whole mind on the commander now You want to man and also what's your long-term mission and that's what kind of you just set yourself like All I picked bodybuilding because I there you just gave yourself a mission So You know you gotta make sure your gear is good you gotta make you know Are your batteries changed right you got like there's all the ways the checklist check list check list check list as a leader It actually makes it easier I found because now I have a reason to check their stuff and Check that their routine so my routine stayed solid right because other I had other guys I had to worry about So rest is a big one I used to have to order my guys to go to ground because they were so because there's only three of us Yeah big time but Put on the best uniform put on you know getting the best shape Polish your boots the highest standard be prepared to get shit on and and and bulldog your way through And smile while you're eating that shit sandwich you know like the doubt is You ever heard that like you ever talked to someone and they talk about what they want they really want to be doing Okay, so I have a I have a buddy of mine. and then I'll see like a retweet with like You know somebody else was watching there's like a thousand watches with like your picture and the air is right next to it And if and I like to eat like if I'm not eating I like to be taking like a shake or something like every three or four hours I just try to intermittent fasting. but you know what you don't need to replace it You don't need to replace it Uh whole stock replace that thing that's a beautiful beautiful experience to have had in your life But don't let it turn into a Black hole right like like the black hole the massive a black hole is some Insane number just like the mass and the and the power of this combat experience is the same thing It's this super powerful experience, but don't let it suck all the other experiences away Don't let it do that Don't let it do that and and so if you eat something and you feel like shit after you know pay attention to that Because that can take a lot of energy away from your workout and just from your date You know like you go roll into work with a headache because you ate something that you're actually allergic to like that can really mess with your mood
