and maybe someone will chime in and tell me that when you're 72 you feel pretty good about what you know but I don't think so I don't think so I think it's just always constantly looking back five years and think to yourself and you know I said before I was like I think when you get to be at some point it's some some decade along there 35 40 you at least say I know I don't know everything and that is like the beginning of knowing something because when you're like you like you said when you're 19 you know you think you know everything when you're 23 you think you know everything when you're 26 you think you know everything when you're 31 you still think you know everything it's not until you actually look up maybe that's 35 maybe that's 37 maybe some people get it younger where they realize you know what I don't know everything and I need to learn more so there you go you're in a learning more but like how you say you're talking earlier how you know if you would have made maybe even three three good decisions you know because like this problem like drugs and alcohol and stuff like that as an individual problem that's not the maker or the breaker right there it's like everything put together you know there's people who are successful that may struggle with drugs and alcohol even for a little bit for a long time on going like you know you don't have to die you know if you make the decision to do the mistake in my opinion but to do drugs and drink alcohol you know or have that kind of hold you back or whatever you don't have to die from that it's like everything you know so even and also on top of that the discipline and all things because that's a question right in all maybe you could maybe you could write a book called the dance of leadership it's a copy that I got me but the in all things like discipline in diet discipline in um you know workouts and not slack in and whatever and that looks way different than discipline in like relationships for example like if you're like a different like to you know the discipline not to lose your temper or they're just a plan to to respond to a maybe not discipline person or something let's say someone you love who's who's maybe emotionally different than you or whatever that looks and feels way different you know if you if you really think about it the like we call lack of control lack of control the pressure the pressure and then that's not mentioned like the day to day chores that allow your hobby activity to be a business or or career whatever man it's a lot like freaking taxes and taxes doing all the yeah man you know how like when you're you work at like a job and the taxes are just taking out the taxes taking out and all this stuff but man you're weaving baskets you know in your in your new garage or whatever man you gotta do taxes all this I don't know man this is just a lot more to it we'll see a child from hobby to career and he was like bro your muscles aren't going to grow that's like what are you talking about of course they do they grow every single day like I feel it even he's like bro you don't know how it works he's like you don't when you lift they don't grow they actually get torn they get like almost like a little micro injury that's how it works but if you feel lonely and isolated that's not good that's getting to you that means your mind is starting to be worn down from this don't let it get worn down it's gonna refuel you to go out it's gonna I watch this watch this if you're feeling only isolated you're workout that day is like a nine if you feel like like hey I'm having a good life I'm I'm filled with energy I like hanging out I just you know how to good time with this girl last night and now I'm going to train it's like and then you could still easily because you work eight hours a day I was like I was like Greg I work 12 hours a day I work 14 hours they I'm still here training you can work in eight hour a day and still train and you can train four hours a day and you can be fine and you'll have money you don't have to worry about paying the rent you don't have to deal with the buy you know nice things you'll have medical insurance all those things and he made the decision to go to x-ray school and he ended up doing great in GG2 and doing great in fighting and he ended up getting some injuries that were like if he would have just been a fighter they would have been really problematic because you know he couldn't fight for a long time he so that's the kind of that's the kind of judgment call right you can make now what what this question is saying though is can you do something when you make a little bit last put your passion about that's that's pretty easy call as far as I would start if you just make a little bit last put you love doing it but if you love making baskets and you don't feel like it and you're like I guess what you gotta make a thousand of those I know you don't feel like you've been making one you gotta make a thousand or make sure they're done or something like man I used to love this thing now I don't really like it because all this pressure which had nothing to do with my hobby by the way nothing now it has everything to do with my hobby now you got I had not have people calling me saying hey where is my basket and I think a lot of times kids they don't recognize that they don't recognize that these little I mean sure if you make a one big bad decision you go drinking and driving you're right you can you can kill yourself you can kill someone else you can ruin your whole life and one bad decision but where did that one bad decision came from it came from a bunch of bad decisions it came from hanging around with the bad people it came with starting to drink in the first place it came with even having the attitude that I can get away with stuff like there's a lot of little bad decisions that led up to this one bad big bad decision that actually ends up putting you in a bad way so that's the story that I just told on the warrior kid podcast and again I know it's kind of a heavy story in fact it's a very heavy story and that's another thing with like as I said to myself well should I talk about should I say that he ended up in jail or something like that that's a big one that's a common one that's heard there'll be like okay because I like taking pictures I like you know I don't know maybe traveling or I don't know whatever whatever I like taking pictures of I like that kind of subject to uh so now but then he's asking a different question which is inside of inside of even Brazilian jiu jitsu there's different types of styles that people will have and these are people go end up calling them games like what kind of game does this person have what kind of game does that person have and different people have different games and it depends on their body the different body types have different styles different games different even different like cardio levels can have different games different styles different flexibility levels different games different styles even different personalities if you have different personalities you'll end up with a different style so the question is are there some games or some styles that are better than other games or other styles inside of jiu jitsu and my answer to that I think is no there's not games that are better than other games not styles of jiu jitsu that are better than other styles of jiu jitsu and as I asked myself that question for the first time I answered it in like a milliseconds with there's kids out there whose dad dies when they're five years old whose mom dies when they're seven years old whose grandma dies who's dog dies like death is part of life and to pretend that it doesn't exist and hope that your kids are just going to one day figure it out that's not the right thing to do they should understand it and so the the last part about this thing about Jeff was you know again he had this spark he was funny and he was just a really good awesome guy and I when I got done you know what I did I did like the typical whatever 11 o'clock at night sitting at the computer thing when I got done writing this thing and I just googled him I thought that that's literally my muscles growing you know like I didn't know how it all worked I was like dang my muscles I can see the growth already so all I got to do is lift every single day watch out quick you know because most people they won't work as hard as me because all just because I like doing it I like to pump whatever so I would do we remember the guy my friend I mentioned Eric Masters pilot in the air force it seems like a lot of times especially when you're training or you're doing something that's kind of directly or can be viewed as like directly opposite of a social thing because you don't when you think socially you're thinking all you guys are just slack and hanging out going to the bar cruising at the beach whatever well while we're over here training kind of thing right just like just like people say oh you're sleeping on the couch you know what are you lazy sleeping on the couch you know your game your style like and there the reason um it might seem kind of but the reason why I like these tall lanky guys they'll do like triangles and stuff because when they first start training though the triangle is going to come way easier than a guy who's not as lanky you know early on so they're like oh shoot that's successful maybe I'm recovering from the work I just did you seem saying I'm saying there's two parts of it you know there's that and so and people give it a bad rap I think especially like you know how like you know you hear these motivational gurus grind all sleep when I'm dead you know that kind of thing and and I got these great memories like I got them right now I can remember doing things with him and and when you're with someone like that and you're almost like a spectator to their life like you're get to watch him you get to go like wow look at what he's doing this is crazy and so when I saw him for the last time you know like we shook hands and again like I could see in his eyes this this element of sadness that he was doing what his life had gone in this direction and my life had gone in this other direction and he was I don't even want to use the term jealous because I don't think he was jealous he wasn't jealous at all he was to absolutely he was actually like kind of proud you could see in his eyes like man that's awesome I just googled him and just googled his name is full name and it was the weirdest thing because when I googled him there was nothing there was nothing no nothing not a name you couldn't his name no obituary no nothing just nothing and that kind of shook me up a little bit and the way it shakes me up is it shakes me up in the fact that that guy had more intelligence than me he had more talent than me he was more charismatic than me he had all these things that were better than me and yet google which I don't know if you ever googled like as I google a lot of stuff all the time because I google you know people that were in the military I google authors poets people that wrote some random like I'll find online some letter from some Lance corporal in World War II You know, that helps, you know, like that mental state to be like, so it's a difference between like, like, you can lift in these different ways too. so yeah man make some exceptions to your discipline and go enjoy the company of some other people grow a little bit as a person become a better human compete better train harder that's it agree so the man this is a concept that I think is if you can kind of incorporate or understand this concept in you know when you're working hard at something so when I was young when I first started lifting weights first started I don't know 15 or whatever well done so you know you know how when you live weights and you get that little pump right to me to me It's almost like an attitude like hey these guys can't hold me down and so you know when we were in fifth grade it was actually in fifth grade where we sat next to each other every day and we would start you know we would just hang out all the time and laugh and eventually he started getting in trouble and I didn't right and I would get in some trouble but he would cross the line and he'd cross the line to where all of a sudden you know he would get it sent to the principal's office and be that kind of trouble. and you have to do you have to like it as a hobby that's kind of in my opinion pretty much the one of the two things that make a hobby so great is because it's fun to do and you don't want everyone as long as you have the time as long as you do whenever you want if you don't feel like that if you don't do it like if you don't feel like golfing tomorrow and I talked to my mom and she told me that if this guy this guy Jeff would been my best friend from probably first grade through like fifth grade and then like I said it separated but he killed himself and 19 years old killed himself and so in the in the story that Uncle Jake tells I don't tell that part I don't talk about suicide but I just say that he died and he died from drugs now call which indirectly is true you know that's what killed him is that he was doing drugs and drinking and he wasn't making clear decisions and went down that path of depression and ended up killing himself and and I remember going you know I was going through seal training just depends on who you are like you the discipline is going to be taking the lead big time you know and when you exercise your freedom with I don't know I don't know I mean chalk ice cream or something like this when you exercise that freedom it's not gonna be very often but when you do boom did you do you feel well you know your answer to the is there a better game or whatever I feel like you know like when you watch ADCC or something like this what's your schedule like right are you wasting any time have you have you maxed and maximize the hours you can get out of a day or are you spending time doing other things that you shouldn't be doing that being said it sounds like you're getting after it pretty hard which means you're probably pretty efficient and if you're if you're not wasting a bunch of time and you're not doing a bunch of things that are non productive and you're feeling lonely and isolated then guess what you're going to for you don't you should not be feeling lonely and isolated that's not good you need to relax especially because if you're training that much you're likely over training so broadly speaking now broadly speaking training should be enjoyable but as I look back on it was like there was like this element of sadness for him seeing that I was going I was like for lack of a better word like getting away I kind of did this little like a mental debate, like, oh, well, you know, I feel like I should, I should do something a little bit more. so you gotta find a little bit of but sounds like you're a little bit off balance especially because you're feeling like the words that kind of keyed me off the most in this was what was it lonely and isolated that that's what kind of if you said everything else here and then you are like um am I over-training? yeah he's like that's like it like hurt like kind of injured but you know it's like in Mikey and the dragons I talk about how there's dragons that are ready to kill and luckily you know I'm publishing I own the publishing company that's making this book because a lot of my editors probably wouldn't like to hear that a normal children's editor doesn't want to hear killing right and as and and also in the book the the king dies right the the king is dead And he was kind of like, well, I just want to get like, like, like, what big muscles? but I think like a your average person me included is like the the spending hurts when you spend spend on stuff you need rather than what you like want you know that's so backwards that's so bad and I believe so this is an interesting thing I've thought about people like to make things people like to make things like it's it's it's a good feeling to make something to create something so I would do the same thing every single day every single day every single day and my friend was like this other guy you know he goes hey you are you Bench in every single day you know it was like But yeah, when you put weights on you, just like, you know, some people, they'll say, I don't know, so I'm going to baseball about something, they'll put a weight on there, or something like that. like oh you know my relationship with my wife you know or even the relationship with your kids like when I think unmit it get a daily discipline in all things including my kids like a burnout you know he cut classes and he you know just kind of went down that spiral and the weird thing is we were such good friends when were your kids at it we didn't not like each other anymore I guess you know he's like you ever you know when the the sorness you know when you get the sorness or whatever it was like I don't lead that way and you know they just got destroyed because you know in his I don't know if he thought like hey look I'm not going to this is me that you're going to love it every day and I talk about that all the time this means every day you wake up and you're all you know smile from one ear to the other you're so happy you got to go do you know squats and deadlifts like no that doesn't happen but broadly the way it makes you feel the way you get you makes you feel should make you so he straight away from the fundamental principles it's like it's like saying well you know with me if I give you if I use a pressure point on your neck then I'll win it's like And I was like, you know the way he said it was like, and I feel that way, but you know, of course, I'm biased because I wrote it. yeah body types man it's kind of like when I watch those kind of like um like you ever heard of the game mortal combat I have heard of it you know it seems like the whole discipline equals freedom thing and whether you agree with it or not actually you know I think you will agree with this it's a dance you know it's a dance with discipline and freedom you mean about about about the economy because I'm going to train but as far as we're like and now that's back on the training and but like with like your relationships unless your relationships aren't important to you which is I mean I would argue most times there's some relationships in your life that that are gonna be important I would argue that but it's a short term thing for sure it's like the immediate like satisfaction is like when you got to pay let's say you you don't really have dentoin shirts right or let's say you do well I don't know maybe they need rest you know or make there's there's there's use in sleep seems like that was a that was a little maybe kind of a glimpse into the echo Charles world right there maybe maybe not not live sleep on the couch maybe I need rest If you don't know what echo looks like, he doesn't look like what he sounds like. Like, you know, like, for like, okay, it's arguably, it's meditation. and then you gotta ask yourself on the other side is could you do this job that you don't really like for long enough that you could make a difference like you could do this job that you don't like and you all said you got a down payment for a house
