00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 136.
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 Who are these?
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000 Why sit? They hear in Twilight.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000 Wherefore rock they, pergatorial shadows,
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000 drooping tongues from jaws that slob their relish,
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000 bearing teeth that lear like skulls teeth wicked.
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000 Stroke on stroke of pain.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 But what slow panic gouged these chasms
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000 round their fredded sockets,
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000 ever from their hair,
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 and through their hands, palms, misery, swelters.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000 Surely we have perished,
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000 sleeping and walk in hell,
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000 but who these hellish.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000 These are men,
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000 whose minds the dead have ravished.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000 Memory, fingers in their hair of mergers,
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000 multitudinous mergers, they once witnessed.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000 Waiting slew of flesh,
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 these helpless wander,
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000 treading blood from lungs that had loved laughter.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000 Always they must see these things,
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000 and hear them,
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000 batter of guns,
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000 and shatter of flying muscles,
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000 carnage incomparible,
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000 and human squander, rocks to thick,
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000 for these men's extrication.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 Therefore, still,
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000 their eyeball shrink tormented back into their brains.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 Because on their sense,
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000 sunlight seems a blood smear.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000 The sun comes blood black,
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000 dawn breaks open like a wound
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000 that bleeds a fresh.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 Thus, their heads,
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000 where this hilarious,
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000 hideous, awful falseness of set smiling corpses.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000 Thus, their hands are plucking at each other,
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000 and the eyes of their scurging.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000 Snatching after us, who smoke them,
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 brother,
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000 calling us,
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000 who dealt them war,
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.000 died before again.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 And that is a poem.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 It's a poem
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000 called Mental Kaces.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000 And it's a poem that was written
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 by Wilford Owen.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.80 He wrote it in 1918.
00:03:54.80 --> 00:04:03.24 He was a British poet, but he was also a British soldier.
00:04:03.24 --> 00:04:06.12 He was wounded in the first world war.
00:04:06.12 --> 00:04:10.36 He was blown up by a trench mortar.
00:04:10.36 --> 00:04:15.40 Then he spent several days unconscious lying with the shredded remains of one of his fellow
00:04:15.40 --> 00:04:18.88 officers.
00:04:18.88 --> 00:04:26.16 With those wounds, he was also diagnosed with shell shock.
00:04:26.16 --> 00:04:35.36 He was sent to a place called Craig Lockhart Hospital, which is where they sent these
00:04:35.36 --> 00:04:39.48 soldiers to be treated.
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:50.28 There he recovered to some extent, and then he went back to the front.
00:04:50.28 --> 00:04:58.68 And on October 1st in 1918, he led a unit from the second manchesters as they assaulted
00:04:58.68 --> 00:05:03.48 enemy positions in John Court.
00:05:03.48 --> 00:05:13.000 He was awarded the military cross for that action.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.08 And on the 4th of November 1918, seven days prior to November 11th, which was the end
00:05:24.08 --> 00:05:28.24 of the war, Wilfredo was killed in action.
00:05:28.24 --> 00:05:39.20 He was shot by a German machine gunner.
00:05:39.20 --> 00:05:46.16 And that poem is obviously about the psychological damage that he saw when he was in Craig
00:05:46.16 --> 00:05:49.000 Lockhart recovering from shell shock.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.16 And I've talked about World War I on this podcast before, and I've talked about the
00:05:55.16 --> 00:05:57.36 shell shock.
00:05:57.36 --> 00:06:03.84 And if you go to YouTube and you Google World War I shell shock, and you watch some of the
00:06:03.84 --> 00:06:12.76 videos you can see, the horror of the shell shock, which reflects the horror of the war itself.
00:06:12.76 --> 00:06:19.72 The trenches, the wounds, the gas, the death, the madness of the thousands and thousands and
00:06:19.72 --> 00:06:25.12 thousands and thousands of deaths over and over and over again.
00:06:25.12 --> 00:06:44.64 And that poem, mental cases, it reflects the nightmare of the shell shock inside the nightmare
00:06:44.64 --> 00:06:49.000 of this war.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.92 And I wanted to hear a little bit about what shell shock looked like from the outside.
00:06:57.92 --> 00:07:03.36 And I found an article called Shell Shock revisited an examination of the case records of
00:07:03.36 --> 00:07:10.000 the National Hospital London by Stephanie Lyndon and Edgar Jones.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.68 And that's good excerpts coming directly from doctors, nurses that worked in these wards.
00:07:20.68 --> 00:07:26.60 And here's one, this is a case from the case of a 27-year-old rifleman known as Frank D,
00:07:26.60 --> 00:07:33.36 who's diagnosed with functional tremor and neurosis like dog Korea.
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:37.44 And if you don't know what that is, it's a disease that gives dogs seizures and tremors
00:07:37.44 --> 00:07:38.44 and fits.
00:07:38.44 --> 00:07:44.28 And again, go to YouTube, you can see these dogs suffering like that.
00:07:44.28 --> 00:07:47.32 And this is what the doctors wrote about Frank D.
00:07:47.32 --> 00:07:52.72 Patient is a territorial, which is a reservist who served heavily in World War I.
00:07:52.72 --> 00:07:56.84 Patient is a territorial and went out to France in January.
00:07:56.84 --> 00:08:00.76 He has been quite well up to a week ago.
00:08:00.76 --> 00:08:01.76 Went on April 26.
00:08:01.76 --> 00:08:04.68 He was buried under a bomb explosion in the trench.
00:08:04.68 --> 00:08:09.48 He was not unconscious but dazed and all in a tremble.
00:08:09.48 --> 00:08:12.48 All his limbs were shaking.
00:08:12.48 --> 00:08:16.76 He was conscious being carried by his comrades out of the trenches to a dugout a few hours
00:08:16.76 --> 00:08:18.32 afterwards.
00:08:18.32 --> 00:08:23.68 He had to cry and he was crying for two days.
00:08:23.68 --> 00:08:29.16 At the same time, his arms began to twitch very frequently at first.
00:08:29.16 --> 00:08:40.44 He was transferred to the 12th General Hospital and from there to here.
00:08:40.44 --> 00:08:48.48 Another case, another entry about a 23 year old Scottish private known as Henry M.
00:08:48.48 --> 00:08:57.56 from the 18th who SARS, who was diagnosed with functional facial spasm.
00:08:57.56 --> 00:09:03.36 On May 13, and this is 1915, patient was struck by several pieces of shrapnel on the right
00:09:03.36 --> 00:09:07.80 hand forearm shoulder and on the right side of the nose at its base.
00:09:07.80 --> 00:09:11.48 He was very dazed but did not lose consciousness.
00:09:11.48 --> 00:09:13.92 The wounds healed in a month.
00:09:13.92 --> 00:09:17.52 About a week after being wounded, he was operated on and ordered that a piece of shrapnel
00:09:17.52 --> 00:09:19.48 might be removed from his face.
00:09:19.48 --> 00:09:23.68 On recovering from the anesthesia, he found himself unable to move the right side of
00:09:23.68 --> 00:09:27.68 his face or open his mouth.
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:32.44 This condition which is quite painless has persisted since and he is not eaten solid food
00:09:32.44 --> 00:09:34.76 or been able to take out his false teeth.
00:09:34.76 --> 00:09:39.36 He has been fed through a rubber tube inserted between his teeth.
00:09:39.36 --> 00:09:43.60 And all other respects he feels well, patient sits up in bed gasping in a highly alarming
00:09:43.60 --> 00:09:45.60 manner.
00:09:45.60 --> 00:09:51.60 With his left face in a strong, tonic spasm and his jaws tightly set, all efforts to open
00:09:51.60 --> 00:09:53.36 his mouth are unavailing.
00:09:53.36 --> 00:09:58.000 So strong is the contraction of his massators.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.04 He declares himself unable to breathe unless sitting up and when made to lie down, his neck
00:10:03.04 --> 00:10:08.56 is strongly retracted and set and he breathes up violently through his clenched teeth and
00:10:08.56 --> 00:10:13.20 holds his breath for as long as he can, assuming a purple tinge which is apt to be
00:10:13.20 --> 00:10:18.32 disconcerting until one is accustomed to it.
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:25.84 By the moral aid given by strong ferodysm which is an electric current applied by the
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:31.48 physician and forced applied to the jaw, it was possible to remove a filthy set of false
00:10:31.48 --> 00:10:35.84 teeth.
00:10:35.84 --> 00:10:41.72 During this performance, he uttered piercing shrieks and foamed and his rigidly held arms
00:10:41.72 --> 00:10:43.32 shook violently.
00:10:43.32 --> 00:10:48.28 Tears ran from his eyes and he swed it profusely from his muscular exertion and resisting
00:10:48.28 --> 00:10:55.52 the attentions well-intended though they were of the physician.
00:10:55.52 --> 00:10:59.12 When asked to close his eyes, he was able to do.
00:10:59.12 --> 00:11:02.16 In fact, the left eye is half closed in spasm.
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:06.48 All test reveal good power in both sides of the face.
00:11:06.48 --> 00:11:13.28 The facial and jaw spasm would seem to be voluntary and due to frank malingering.
00:11:13.28 --> 00:11:19.20 In the intervals of this grotesque performance, he lies back on the pillow without any
00:11:19.20 --> 00:11:27.04 dysponia but he induces an apparent difficulty in breathing it will.
00:11:27.04 --> 00:11:38.64 Examinations reveal no organic or injury in either nervous or other systems.
00:11:38.64 --> 00:11:46.64 So just to recap, they're stating that the facial and jaw spasms would seem to be from
00:11:46.64 --> 00:11:53.04 voluntary and malingering, basically saying that he's doing this so that he can avoid the
00:11:53.04 --> 00:12:00.48 war.
00:12:00.48 --> 00:12:05.12 Here's another different type of symptom of shell shock.
00:12:05.12 --> 00:12:09.48 This is a 23-year-old private named Albert R.
00:12:09.48 --> 00:12:13.80 And it's reported that he had marked twitching of the face and the whole body at times
00:12:13.80 --> 00:12:14.80 trembles.
00:12:14.80 --> 00:12:18.64 He looks ill and regurgitates wind.
00:12:18.64 --> 00:12:23.32 He complains of a peculiar feeling of worms growing in the lower part of the abdomen.
00:12:23.32 --> 00:12:26.80 He coughs considerably and said that his stomach swells up.
00:12:26.80 --> 00:12:31.12 Alump appears in his throat which chokes him.
00:12:31.12 --> 00:12:34.64 And he is continually expecting.
00:12:34.64 --> 00:12:37.44 The nights are particularly hard on him.
00:12:37.44 --> 00:12:40.40 He sits up in bed and has great difficulty breathing.
00:12:40.40 --> 00:12:44.88 Cannot lie down properly but lies over to one side, either left or right.
00:12:44.88 --> 00:12:51.72 Quits his hand up to hold his head still from shaking.
00:12:51.72 --> 00:12:55.88 He has a depressed and solemn look.
00:12:55.88 --> 00:13:00.88 There are involuntary movements characterized by a very fine tremor manifested when his hands
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:04.60 are spread out and his fingers are separated.
00:13:04.60 --> 00:13:09.28 There's a slight tremor and his legs of the same nature as it appears in the other part
00:13:09.28 --> 00:13:15.000 of the body.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:24.24 So those are some examples of this horrible affliction of shell shock.
00:13:24.24 --> 00:13:30.44 And as you noticed in some of these in that one right up in particular, there was people
00:13:30.44 --> 00:13:34.20 that were saying, they're just faking this.
00:13:34.20 --> 00:13:39.28 They could overcome this if they would be braver.
00:13:39.28 --> 00:13:42.84 Some people did recognize that this was a serious issue and that this was a new kind
00:13:42.84 --> 00:13:47.44 of wound and a new kind of war in November of 1914.
00:13:47.44 --> 00:13:51.32 So this is pretty early on November 1914.
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:57.60 Lord Nutsford, chairman of the London Hospital House Committee, wrote an appeal that was
00:13:57.60 --> 00:14:01.28 published in London newspapers and here's what he wrote.
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:07.52 There are certain number of our gallant soldiers for whom no proper provision is at present
00:14:07.52 --> 00:14:11.36 obtainable but is sorely needed.
00:14:11.36 --> 00:14:16.56 They are suffering from very severe mental and nervous shock due to exposure, excessive
00:14:16.56 --> 00:14:20.12 strain and tension.
00:14:20.12 --> 00:14:24.72 They can be cured if only they receive proper attention from the physicians who have made
00:14:24.72 --> 00:14:27.40 a specialty of treating such conditions.
00:14:27.40 --> 00:14:32.28 These men are quite unsuitable patients for general hospitals as their chance of recovery
00:14:32.28 --> 00:14:40.20 depends on absolute quiet and on the individual and prolonged attention of the physician.
00:14:40.20 --> 00:14:46.56 If not cured, these men will drift back to the world as wrecks and miserable wrecks
00:14:46.56 --> 00:14:50.60 for the rest of their lives.
00:14:50.60 --> 00:14:56.52 So there were some people that recognized this was a factor that went well beyond the bravery
00:14:56.52 --> 00:14:59.68 of the individual.
00:14:59.68 --> 00:15:05.76 But unfortunately that was probably less percentage of people.
00:15:05.76 --> 00:15:14.52 Most people thought that these individuals that suffered this affliction of shell shock,
00:15:14.52 --> 00:15:18.76 thought that they were just, they weren't brave.
00:15:18.76 --> 00:15:26.84 And we've talked about it with a bunch of podcasts, Dick Winner's talks about it, hack
00:15:26.84 --> 00:15:30.88 worth talks about it that there's a cup that gets filled and it gets filled too much.
00:15:30.88 --> 00:15:31.88 People can't take anymore.
00:15:31.88 --> 00:15:34.32 It's not because they're not good people.
00:15:34.32 --> 00:15:36.36 It's not because they aren't brave or they weren't brave.
00:15:36.36 --> 00:15:38.36 It's because they're done.
00:15:38.36 --> 00:15:39.84 They're done.
00:15:39.84 --> 00:15:40.84 And there's ways you can treat them.
00:15:40.84 --> 00:15:41.84 We've talked about it before.
00:15:41.84 --> 00:15:44.24 You see a guy that looks like he's going to be done.
00:15:44.24 --> 00:15:45.24 You need to get him rest.
00:15:45.24 --> 00:15:46.92 And if they get rest, they can recover.
00:15:46.92 --> 00:15:50.24 If they don't get rest and they just continually put into it, you're going to burn that
00:15:50.24 --> 00:15:51.24 engine out.
00:15:51.24 --> 00:15:53.24 You're going to burn out their brain.
00:15:53.24 --> 00:15:59.000 Well, they didn't quite understand that yet.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.08 And again, this type of warfare was totally new.
00:16:03.08 --> 00:16:10.28 There wasn't this kind of just continual slaughter ever before.
00:16:10.28 --> 00:16:11.64 And if it was, it was like an incident.
00:16:11.64 --> 00:16:13.68 Oh, there was a huge battle and there were a bunch of people killed.
00:16:13.68 --> 00:16:15.32 It wasn't like we're going to go do that again tomorrow.
00:16:15.32 --> 00:16:16.32 Well, guess what?
00:16:16.32 --> 00:16:20.68 These guys were going to go and do that same thing tomorrow and the next day and the
00:16:20.68 --> 00:16:24.56 day after that.
00:16:24.56 --> 00:16:34.44 So I want to talk about something that is as horrible as World War I was.
00:16:34.44 --> 00:16:41.56 This might be the most horrible part of World War I.
00:16:41.56 --> 00:16:43.52 And I know that's a bold statement.
00:16:43.52 --> 00:16:47.48 But I want to start by telling you the story of one individual soldier.
00:16:47.48 --> 00:16:51.56 His name was Harry Far.
00:16:51.56 --> 00:16:56.92 And I'm going to go to a book about his life.
00:16:56.92 --> 00:16:59.96 The book is called He Was No Coward.
00:16:59.96 --> 00:17:06.04 It was written by Janet Booth and James White.
00:17:06.04 --> 00:17:11.36 And it tells the story of Harry Far, the Harry Far story.
00:17:11.36 --> 00:17:18.64 Now it starts off by giving a little background on Harry Far and he grew up young man.
00:17:18.64 --> 00:17:23.68 And it kind of starts off with him meeting who he would eventually marry, a woman by the
00:17:23.68 --> 00:17:25.80 name of Gertrude.
00:17:25.80 --> 00:17:30.64 And we'll go to the book, Gertrude and Harry started walking out together.
00:17:30.64 --> 00:17:34.32 They both loved visiting the Gady Theater.
00:17:34.32 --> 00:17:39.08 And many happy evening was spent at the Hammer Smith Empire watching The Variety
00:17:39.08 --> 00:17:42.04 Showers. The pair soon became girlfriend and boyfriend.
00:17:42.04 --> 00:17:44.52 And for the next four years they became inseparable.
00:17:44.52 --> 00:17:47.04 But not without some bumps in the roads.
00:17:47.04 --> 00:17:51.12 At the age of 20, Harry was four years Gertrude's senior.
00:17:51.12 --> 00:17:54.20 Something her family was not happy about.
00:17:54.20 --> 00:17:55.20 But what did she say?
00:17:55.20 --> 00:17:55.96 She said, I love him.
00:17:55.96 --> 00:17:57.60 I'm going with him.
00:17:57.60 --> 00:18:00.92 And that's that.
00:18:00.92 --> 00:18:02.60 So they're young.
00:18:02.60 --> 00:18:04.000 They're in love.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.96 And Harry was earning good money working as a scaffolder on the building
00:18:08.96 --> 00:18:11.000 sites across London.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.36 And it came as quite a shock in April 1913 when Gertrude realized she was pregnant.
00:18:18.36 --> 00:18:22.88 A child born out of wedlock would bring shame and disgrace on the immediate family,
00:18:22.88 --> 00:18:24.64 going to the pending arrival of the baby.
00:18:24.64 --> 00:18:28.80 They had to bring their wedding forward and were married as soon as possible.
00:18:28.80 --> 00:18:32.24 By the time of the wedding, they had been together for three years.
00:18:32.24 --> 00:18:38.08 And they were married in Kensington Registry office in the summer of 1913.
00:18:38.08 --> 00:18:43.40 The baby, who was to be their only child was born on October 29th of that year, they named
00:18:43.40 --> 00:18:49.20 her Gertrude Nellie, her middle-named after Harry's sisterhood emigrated to America.
00:18:49.20 --> 00:18:56.52 But the new baby would be known affectionately as little Gertie.
00:18:56.52 --> 00:19:06.16 Now prior to meeting Gertie, Harry had, well, I'll go to the book, Harry had chosen
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:08.16 adventurous path in 1908.
00:19:08.16 --> 00:19:09.68 So this is previous.
00:19:09.68 --> 00:19:12.96 When he had just turned 18, he had decided to join the army.
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:18.60 He enlisted as a regular soldier in the first battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment
00:19:18.60 --> 00:19:23.04 known as the Prince of Wales' own.
00:19:23.04 --> 00:19:27.04 Little is known of his two years as a regular soldier.
00:19:27.04 --> 00:19:33.04 But later records show, he was considered to be a reliable and trustworthy soldier with
00:19:33.04 --> 00:19:37.04 an exemplary record of good behavior.
00:19:37.04 --> 00:19:41.44 Now this happens in America as well when you're on active duty, which is what he was
00:19:41.44 --> 00:19:45.28 those first two years when you get done with active duty, they put you on some sort of
00:19:45.28 --> 00:19:46.28 reserve status.
00:19:46.28 --> 00:19:49.36 There's, I think it's called IRR.
00:19:49.36 --> 00:19:52.60 And maybe it stands for immediate regular reserve.
00:19:52.60 --> 00:19:53.60 I don't really remember.
00:19:53.60 --> 00:19:55.92 I was on it for some amount of time, but I don't remember.
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:58.80 And it's basically when you're out, but they can recall you.
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:02.12 And then you can say active reserve, which is when you're still getting paid, maybe you
00:20:02.12 --> 00:20:03.68 should do some drills and whatnot.
00:20:03.68 --> 00:20:04.88 It sounds like he was in a company.
00:20:04.88 --> 00:20:07.08 When he got out, he was in a combination of those two.
00:20:07.08 --> 00:20:08.24 We'll go to the book.
00:20:08.24 --> 00:20:13.16 Most soldiers who had left the army were automatically placed in the section B reserve,
00:20:13.16 --> 00:20:17.80 it meant that for five years they could be called upon in the event of general mobilization.
00:20:17.80 --> 00:20:21.40 And were paid three shilling and six pence per week as a retainer.
00:20:21.40 --> 00:20:24.20 While also being obliged to undertake periodic training.
00:20:24.20 --> 00:20:26.84 So that's sort of like the reserves.
00:20:26.84 --> 00:20:31.40 I had to throw this in there in a pamphlet entitled a short history of the West Yorkshire
00:20:31.40 --> 00:20:37.60 Regiment, the excitable introduction to the unit nicknamed the old and bold claims.
00:20:37.60 --> 00:20:42.64 No regimen in the British army has a more glorious history than the West Yorkshire Regiment,
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:46.28 the Prince of Wales own.
00:20:46.28 --> 00:20:51.32 For its record and gallon and devoted service to King and Country, in many parts of the
00:20:51.32 --> 00:20:57.12 empire is equaled by few and surpassed by none.
00:20:57.12 --> 00:21:03.96 So proud history and can probably figure out where this is going.
00:21:03.96 --> 00:21:07.56 The war kicks off, world war one kicks off.
00:21:07.56 --> 00:21:11.32 And he gets recalled to go and serve back to the book.
00:21:11.32 --> 00:21:14.88 He had previously served with the regiments first battalion, but its soldiers were already
00:21:14.88 --> 00:21:16.84 in France when he returned to duty.
00:21:16.84 --> 00:21:20.44 So he joined the second battalion before his passage to France.
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:25.08 Harry is granted a weekend past allowing him to return to London and spend precious
00:21:25.08 --> 00:21:28.60 last few days with his wife and young child.
00:21:28.60 --> 00:21:34.24 Gertis first birthday was celebrated that weekend and Gertru promised to write her husband
00:21:34.24 --> 00:21:39.84 frequently as well as sending him food and clothing parcels after what must have been an extremely
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:40.84 difficult farewell.
00:21:40.84 --> 00:21:45.56 Harry returned to camp having slightly overstated his past subsequently being forced
00:21:45.56 --> 00:21:51.44 to forfeit four days pay.
00:21:51.44 --> 00:21:57.12 Like Harry, the majority of his fellow comrades had never boarded a boat before let alone
00:21:57.12 --> 00:21:59.68 left England shores.
00:21:59.68 --> 00:22:04.80 Despite reasonably smooth crossing to France, many of the men suffered from sea sickness,
00:22:04.80 --> 00:22:09.64 those not being sick were in good cheer and eager to face the enemy and battle, the general
00:22:09.64 --> 00:22:16.80 consensus of the men being that by Christmas this bloody war will be over.
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:19.20 So it turns around pretty quick.
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:23.56 Even in the book that part turns around pretty quick and obviously I skip some sections
00:22:23.56 --> 00:22:26.24 but we get right into it.
00:22:26.24 --> 00:22:30.56 On November 13th at 11pm the West Yorkshire is relieved the Devin Regiment.
00:22:30.56 --> 00:22:33.64 The very next day the soldiers came under fire for the first time and suffered their
00:22:33.64 --> 00:22:38.32 first casualties with three men wounded.
00:22:38.32 --> 00:22:43.56 Indeed one account of the battalions first taste of trench warfare described the soldiers
00:22:43.56 --> 00:22:47.52 great discomfort in heavy mud.
00:22:47.52 --> 00:22:52.60 At times during this period the trenches occupied by the West Yorkshire Regiment soldiers
00:22:52.60 --> 00:22:59.20 were two to six feet deep in water and cold mud baths were common.
00:22:59.20 --> 00:23:04.04 So also was the inevitable accompaniment of sickness.
00:23:04.04 --> 00:23:09.20 On November 19th the battalion lost its first man to sniper fire with another six wounded.
00:23:09.20 --> 00:23:13.96 Even when the men were resting in the barns and houses allocated behind to them behind
00:23:13.96 --> 00:23:20.40 the lines there was no respite from the shelling.
00:23:20.40 --> 00:23:25.88 Acting sergeant Walter Weston recorded the difficulty of fighting in the rapidly deteriorating
00:23:25.88 --> 00:23:30.64 conditions he wrote the continual rain where the whole terrain had turned into a quagmire
00:23:30.64 --> 00:23:36.28 of liquid mud making it difficult for the transport carrying supplies and weapons to continue
00:23:36.28 --> 00:23:37.80 along the muddy roads.
00:23:37.80 --> 00:23:42.92 Every so often they had to stop and push the vehicles over the Chloe mud.
00:23:42.92 --> 00:23:48.04 One more harrowing was to try to pull comrades out of the mud many perished by slipping
00:23:48.04 --> 00:23:52.52 off the duckboards and disappearing into the slime.
00:23:52.52 --> 00:24:00.52 The day spent in wet and muddy trenches left some soldiers incapacitated by transfer and invariably
00:24:00.52 --> 00:24:08.36 resulted in many of the men having a foot or both feet amputated.
00:24:08.36 --> 00:24:13.40 The pitiful sight of the horses and mules stuck in the rain, soil, struggling to free
00:24:13.40 --> 00:24:16.40 themselves from the mud.
00:24:16.40 --> 00:24:21.24 So yeah we think about trench foot you know think of your feet or uncomfortable or whatever.
00:24:21.24 --> 00:24:27.12 You don't think about having one or both of your feet amputated.
00:24:27.12 --> 00:24:31.40 December 18th the West Yorkshire Regiments Colonel and captains were told that the second
00:24:31.40 --> 00:24:35.28 battalion deven regiment would be attacking the German trench and two companies of Yorkshire
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:41.000 German would be sent in support to dig and make good any captured trenches.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.56 The official Battalion Diary records the deven attack commenced from the left and was
00:24:46.56 --> 00:24:48.44 late in starting.
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:51.96 The right company never advanced thus creating a block in the trenches.
00:24:51.96 --> 00:24:56.60 The left company's attack was unsuccessful owing to the wire arrangements, but the left
00:24:56.60 --> 00:25:03.12 center of company occupied 150 yards of the main German trench.
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:07.000 The midnight the entire second battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment was ordered to take
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.88 over the captured trench and improve it for defense while their comrades dug in alongside.
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:16.92 However at 8 a.m., the Germans responded with hand grenades thrown in great quantities and
00:25:16.92 --> 00:25:24.000 very rapidly forcing the men occupying the trench to retreat to the British front line.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.16 As a consequence of the sub-naction, the company of West Yorkshire soldiers attempting to dig
00:25:29.16 --> 00:25:35.68 on the right were left exposed and suffered withering on filet fire.
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:41.48 They also retreated and the attack ended in failure and the battalion suffered two officers
00:25:41.48 --> 00:25:57.08 killed, two wounded and 120 other ranks killed or wounded almost all sustained in the retreat.
00:25:57.08 --> 00:26:05.000 The New Year and again advancing through the book and to get the full details get the book
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.40 and read it.
00:26:07.40 --> 00:26:12.60 The New Year of 1915 began as the old one finished for the Yorkshireman cold wet and in
00:26:12.60 --> 00:26:14.32 the trenches.
00:26:14.32 --> 00:26:19.72 January 6 one man was killed and the lieutenant was taken to the hospital.
00:26:19.72 --> 00:26:22.84 Despite the hostile nature of the enemy just a few hundred yards in front of him the
00:26:22.84 --> 00:26:35.88 battalion diary noted that the main cause of casualties was increasingly a result of sickness.
00:26:35.88 --> 00:26:42.56 As well as the ever-present water and mud disease and sickness was carried by living sources
00:26:42.56 --> 00:26:47.76 from the ice that infested every bit of clothing to the rats that feasted on the unburied
00:26:47.76 --> 00:26:49.76 dead.
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:55.000 All fossil rights the stench of rotten flesh was over everything.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.44 Hardly replaced by the chloride of lime sprinkled on particularly offensive sights, dead
00:27:02.44 --> 00:27:08.80 horses and dead men and parts of both were sometimes not buried for months and often simply
00:27:08.80 --> 00:27:15.68 became an element of parapids and trench walls.
00:27:15.68 --> 00:27:23.60 You could smell the lime miles before you could see it.
00:27:23.60 --> 00:27:30.56 So if you've never smelled the dead body before it's an absolutely horrible horrible, horrible
00:27:30.56 --> 00:27:40.000 smell and when you think about the places where you're living are actually partially built
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.80 from bodies and parts of bodies it's hard to even imagine what the stench was and how bad
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:53.36 it was.
00:27:53.36 --> 00:27:57.80 Back to the book one man was killed and another wounded on January 12th on January 19th
00:27:57.80 --> 00:28:02.92 the trenches had dried out slightly and four men were injured in action on January 25th
00:28:02.92 --> 00:28:07.60 rifle fire was recorded as being heavier than usual but ultimately the expected attack
00:28:07.60 --> 00:28:13.44 never came though three men were killed in the course of the day the following day was
00:28:13.44 --> 00:28:22.92 off to the billets in La Flinke this time in the brigade reserve two men were killed
00:28:22.92 --> 00:28:31.08 in one wounded but a draft of 50 men arrived.
00:28:31.08 --> 00:28:35.84 On the last day of the month snow fell with water building in the trenches but the enemy
00:28:35.84 --> 00:28:41.48 was quiet the whole month of January had been spent either in the trenches or in the nearby
00:28:41.48 --> 00:28:49.44 reserve with no time spent any distance away from the guns.
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:53.92 On February 4th the battalion relieved second battalion four men were killed and five
00:28:53.92 --> 00:28:59.36 were wounded on February 10th the battalion was back in the line losing one man and two wounded
00:28:59.36 --> 00:29:04.000 on February 11th.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.76 March 6th five men were injured some severely when they hit they were hit by shrapnel
00:29:08.76 --> 00:29:13.84 in the morning two of the five died of their wounds later that day.
00:29:13.84 --> 00:29:22.40 It's weird you think about this it's just pecking away it's just pecking away day after
00:29:22.40 --> 00:29:26.44 day after day after day.
00:29:26.44 --> 00:29:33.12 You got you got 250 guys or something in your company maybe 200 guys in your company
00:29:33.12 --> 00:29:37.60 and it's two here it's three there it's eight wounded there it's four wounded there and
00:29:37.60 --> 00:29:44.12 then you get you get drafts come in which is new fresh guys 50 of them coming in to replace
00:29:44.12 --> 00:29:49.20 the guys that you've lost.
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:54.72 Officers were issued with a full set of orders on March 9th for the attack on New
00:29:54.72 --> 00:29:58.000 Vais Chappelle.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.32 March 10th at 7 30 a.m. the bombardment of enemy positions began with wire cutting
00:30:02.32 --> 00:30:09.04 shrapnel to aid any breakthroughs by the infantry the first shell to fall was fired by an
00:30:09.04 --> 00:30:16.44 impressive 15 inch howitzer and weighed an incredible 1400 pounds.
00:30:16.44 --> 00:30:20.80 However their advance was blocked the battalion then withdrew back to British trenches
00:30:20.80 --> 00:30:27.76 and held the line casualties had been severe as they had crossed as they had across the front
00:30:27.76 --> 00:30:34.08 on the murderous first day of the battle 23 members of the battalion were dead 51 men had
00:30:34.08 --> 00:30:41.20 been wounded three were missing but the savage fighting was to continue that for a and the
00:30:41.20 --> 00:30:47.36 next day orders received to move 17 members of the regiment were killed outright 40 men
00:30:47.36 --> 00:30:53.28 and one officer were wounded four men were missing shelling continued inflicting heavy casualties
00:30:53.28 --> 00:30:58.64 on the severely depleted west Yorkshire men as they hurled in the trenches in cold and
00:30:58.64 --> 00:31:05.44 misty conditions.
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:12.48 By this stage of the attack the infantry soldiers were exhausted dead on their feet would have been
00:31:12.48 --> 00:31:16.96 an accurate description the condition of the gallant fellows who had been fighting and marching
00:31:16.96 --> 00:31:23.20 two and from the trenches since the early hours of the 10th with practically no respite was now pityable.
00:31:25.04 --> 00:31:29.84 Men fell asleep at every halt having to be roused by violent means.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:42.48 Among the ranks 14 men were killed 31 wounded six winners missing at 7pm the soldiers moved off
00:31:42.48 --> 00:31:49.76 the occupied line of trenches. Grimley the battalion diarist noted we found this trench unoccupied
00:31:51.92 --> 00:32:00.40 and full of dead. The deaths and injuries continued forward killed 28 wounded three went
00:32:00.40 --> 00:32:07.36 missing during the day November 5th General Hay goes to become the commander and chief of the British
00:32:07.36 --> 00:32:16.96 Expeditionary Force the following year wrote in his diary that why my one thought was how soon
00:32:16.96 --> 00:32:23.44 I could get my battle worn troops relieved and given a few days rest out of the trenches and shell fire.
00:32:28.32 --> 00:32:35.20 On July 30th 1915 he was even more explicit saying one lesson of this war was that troops could stand
00:32:35.20 --> 00:32:38.96 four days hard fighting and then must be relieved.
00:32:41.92 --> 00:32:46.72 So you take that right there you take four days that that's an average from this guy that's seen
00:32:46.72 --> 00:32:49.44 these folks on the front line. So that means there's people that are less than that there's some
00:32:49.44 --> 00:32:53.68 people that are more some people can handle eight days 10 days some people can handle one day some
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:59.20 people can't handle any the average is four days and here are these guys on the line for 10 20
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:04.56 13 17 days at a time and there is times that I'm not mentioning where they're going back off the
00:33:04.56 --> 00:33:09.60 front line and they're getting a little bit of recovery but then they're going right back in and
00:33:09.60 --> 00:33:13.20 it's not four days that they're going into for they're going in for eight days for 12 days.
00:33:16.96 --> 00:33:20.24 Back to the book there was a little action with two men killed in one wounded the
00:33:20.24 --> 00:33:25.52 battalion was relieved by the second battalion Lincoln Regiment and March to Bill it's just a mile away
00:33:25.52 --> 00:33:36.000 from the battleground the second battalion had lost more than a quarter of its strength.
00:33:37.44 --> 00:33:43.44 Marching teeth donned cold and wet and despite the battalion diaris noting that it was quiet
00:33:45.76 --> 00:33:54.48 three men were killed. Quiet day three men were killed. April six the shell exploded
00:33:54.48 --> 00:34:02.72 in a company billet killing three and in during eight. 5 a.m. on May 9th the artillery bombardment
00:34:02.72 --> 00:34:09.52 of the enemy trenches began with the attack launched just 40 minutes later so here we are on another
00:34:09.52 --> 00:34:15.84 attack on another attack. During the shelling and small arms fire from the Germans there were
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:27.20 three were killed 13 were wounded and three posted is missing. And this results and the French attack
00:34:27.20 --> 00:34:37.68 on Vimi Ridge failed after a week costing the French 100,000 casualties. The British attack on
00:34:37.68 --> 00:34:46.72 Auburn's Ridge which is what they were working on failed ignominiously. So that's the life
00:34:48.32 --> 00:34:54.56 if you can call it that. And here's where we start to hear a little bit about Harry by this time
00:34:54.56 --> 00:35:00.08 Harry had been withdrawn from the front line suffering from what was becoming known as shell shock.
00:35:00.08 --> 00:35:07.12 He was taken off duty on May 9th. However rather than being viewed as a psychological
00:35:07.12 --> 00:35:12.40 condition some doctors and researchers were viewing the symptoms more in line with a neurological
00:35:12.40 --> 00:35:18.96 disorder or the result of a concussion from shell blast treatment for the condition
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:23.60 largely involved rest away from the front line and possibly some talking therapies that we
00:35:23.60 --> 00:35:29.36 would now refer to as counseling. Some doctors utilize electric shock therapy and isolation
00:35:29.36 --> 00:35:36.80 therapy on sufferers but both were unproven and experimental. There's a doctor Stevenson that says
00:35:36.80 --> 00:35:42.40 post-traumatic stress disorder this is looking back post-traumatic stress disorder was exacerbated
00:35:42.40 --> 00:35:47.60 by the special conditions of static warfare in which soldiers endured repeated bombardments
00:35:47.60 --> 00:35:55.84 in confined spaces with little control over their fate. And live day by day in close proximity
00:35:55.84 --> 00:36:00.88 to their comrades decomposing remains. So I've talked about this before we talked about it when
00:36:00.88 --> 00:36:05.60 Jordan was on Jordan Peterson. When you don't have any control, when you're not on offense,
00:36:05.60 --> 00:36:10.88 it's a lot harder to deal with psychologically and this is the ultimate defensive. You're just
00:36:10.88 --> 00:36:17.60 going to get bombed and there's nothing you can do about it. And by the way, you're going to watch
00:36:17.60 --> 00:36:24.64 your friends and your comrades get wounded and killed every single day. Back to the book.
00:36:25.60 --> 00:36:32.72 In the summer of 1915, Gertrude received a letter from France but she did not recognize the handwriting
00:36:32.72 --> 00:36:39.12 on the envelope as Harry's. So his wife gets a letter, she has recognized the handwriting.
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:44.64 The letter stated that Harry was ill and in the hospital he had been evacuated
00:36:45.84 --> 00:36:51.52 from the hoop lanes area in May as he had been suffering from what was known as shell shock.
00:36:52.72 --> 00:36:59.60 Stricing by nervous exhaustion, his hands had been shaking too much to hold a pencil so
00:36:59.60 --> 00:37:11.12 a nurse at the hospital had written the letter for him. Again, uncontrollable shaking.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.16 This is what these guys are experiencing. So bad he can't write his letter, a letter to his wife.
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:22.32 After the extended period behind the lines, Harry was assessed and certified fit.
00:37:22.96 --> 00:37:27.28 He was sent back to the West Yorkshire Regiment. This time joining the first battalion,
00:37:27.28 --> 00:37:31.92 part of the 18th Infantry Brigade's sixth division in October of 1915.
00:37:33.92 --> 00:37:39.92 On October 21, 89 men including Harry joined the battalion while it was camped behind the line.
00:37:39.92 --> 00:37:46.96 Shortly after, the Germans launched a huge barrage against Allied rest areas along all the
00:37:46.96 --> 00:37:52.32 front in retaliation for royal artillery shelling of their own billets.
00:37:52.32 --> 00:37:59.12 Although little damage was done, the sound of the guns which had caused Harry to fall ill before
00:38:00.40 --> 00:38:08.80 had begun all over again for him. At the end of the month of the battalion began an 11-day
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:14.88 spell in the trenches characterized by heavy rain, collapsing fortifications and mud by November 3rd
00:38:14.88 --> 00:38:20.000 in officer had been killed and almost all dugouts had collapsed leaving men with little
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:29.68 respite from the appalling weather. On December 5, the battalion marched to every link,
00:38:29.68 --> 00:38:34.96 spending the next 10 days forming working parties to carry out tasks such as repairing paths,
00:38:34.96 --> 00:38:40.000 despite not being in the line casualties were sustained when the parties were sheld and
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.84 fired upon by riflemen. So even when you go back to the rear, you're still getting shot
00:38:45.84 --> 00:38:51.84 ins killed. December 19th, when the area came under untill the re-bombardment and that frightening
00:38:51.84 --> 00:39:00.40 phenomenon of battle, the use of gas. The action began at 530 a.m. when the British held trenches
00:39:00.40 --> 00:39:07.60 came under heavy rifle fire, then at 645 a.m. when troops were stood to in anticipation for an attack,
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.72 shells containing gas were fired by the Germans.
00:39:10.72 --> 00:39:19.76 The effect the gas was instantaneous and horrifying during the day 11 men died in 23 were wounded
00:39:19.76 --> 00:39:26.72 too sufferingly effects of gas. Total allied losses on the day as a direct result of gas were
00:39:26.72 --> 00:39:36.000 1,069 casualties and 69 deaths. The battalion was back in the trenches for the end of the year
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.76 and the start of the new one on December 30th. The battalion's headquarters was sheld,
00:39:41.76 --> 00:39:48.32 suffering two men killed and four injured. On February 14th, German artillery shells fell again in
00:39:48.32 --> 00:39:52.80 the battalion killing five and injuring 15. By the time the first battalion left the trenches
00:39:52.80 --> 00:39:57.92 the next evening, it had suffered the losses of nine killed and 51 injured.
00:40:00.24 --> 00:40:04.64 It underscores the losses suffered by the British army during the first World War,
00:40:04.64 --> 00:40:11.60 when 7,000 soldiers were killed and wounded every day as a matter of course.
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:26.000 7,000 a day. March 17th as they marched the four miles to begin a period of rest that was
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.64 the last month, two men were killed and three men were wounded. How the soldiers were afflicted
00:40:30.64 --> 00:40:37.84 is not recorded. It's first spelled back in the trenches so they go get some rest now. It's coming
00:40:37.84 --> 00:40:42.000 back in the first spelled back in the trenches after a month away from the line five were wounded and
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.80 five killed. During April, Harry reported sick with nerves and was treated at a dressing station for
00:40:48.80 --> 00:40:56.56 two weeks before returning to front line duty. His problems were worsening. Yet the fact
00:40:56.56 --> 00:41:05.04 he was not sent far behind the lines, suggest medical officers did not deem him sick enough to be evacuated.
00:41:08.48 --> 00:41:15.20 June 3rd, another operation losses during the operation were heavy with one officer in five
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:21.60 sergeants killed as well as five other ranks. Two sergeants in 24 other ranks were wounded
00:41:21.60 --> 00:41:33.60 at total casualty rate of about 17%. On July 1st, less than 100 miles south of their position
00:41:33.60 --> 00:41:41.12 following a week in which 1.6 million shells were fired, British forces attacked on mass
00:41:41.44 --> 00:41:47.12 on a 15 mile long front. The slaughter that ensued on the first day of the battle of the
00:41:47.12 --> 00:41:54.32 Psalm was prodigious with almost 60,000 British casualties a third of them dead.
00:41:57.68 --> 00:42:01.68 News of the slaughter took days to filter back to Britain and thanks to heavy censorship of the
00:42:01.68 --> 00:42:07.52 press, the horrors of the battle were not truly expressed but the casualty lists gave no lie to the
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:18.32 situation. On July 15th, the west Yorkshire's left camp and moved by train to E.B.
00:42:19.28 --> 00:42:26.24 where they relieved the 11th battalion. Harry again reported sick with nerves on July 22nd and was
00:42:26.24 --> 00:42:31.92 detained by medical corps soldiers for the day but this time he was returned as fit for duty the next day.
00:42:31.92 --> 00:42:38.16 So this guy's fallen apart, he keeps asking for help and he keeps sending him back to the front.
00:42:38.88 --> 00:42:43.76 And mind you, he's in a state, not all the time but he's at least reaching a state where he can't even
00:42:43.76 --> 00:42:48.24 write a letter to his wife. Can't even steady his hand for that and they're putting him back to the
00:42:48.24 --> 00:42:53.12 front over and over again. On August 6th, the camp was broken and the battalion marched the battalion
00:42:53.12 --> 00:42:58.88 adjoined the battle of the Psalm. Inchemists for the unprecedented British losses and intensity of the
00:42:58.88 --> 00:43:04.80 shelling operation, the next four days were spent in the brigade reserve as before with hundreds of
00:43:04.80 --> 00:43:11.52 men sent digging and carrying duties. This work proved more hazardous than the previous week with
00:43:11.52 --> 00:43:18.88 four killed nine wounded, one man messing believed to have blown up. On September 11th, the battalion
00:43:18.88 --> 00:43:24.96 proceeded with brigade to an area known as sand pits. The following day was spent with the brigade
00:43:24.96 --> 00:43:32.64 in reserve in six men were killed and four more were wounded. A man admitted general British offensive
00:43:32.64 --> 00:43:38.32 across the sector involving the use of the latest weapon tanks. On September 18th, the battalion joined
00:43:38.32 --> 00:43:45.36 other forces of six division in attacking opposing trenches at 550 AM whistle sounded along the line
00:43:45.36 --> 00:43:51.84 as soldiers poured up over the front trenches through previously cut barbed wire and between
00:43:51.84 --> 00:43:59.20 breastworks. Companies were met with very heavy machine gun and rifle fire and more first
00:43:59.20 --> 00:44:06.56 forced to retreat back from the trenches where the attack started from. The cost was shockingly high
00:44:06.56 --> 00:44:11.52 with more than 100 casualties across the battalion and attrition rate of more than 10 percent
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:17.68 among the 13 dead were three officers, almost 100 officers, almost 100 soldiers were wounded
00:44:17.68 --> 00:44:26.32 including four officers. Later on September 19th, the exhausted soldiers made their way to
00:44:26.32 --> 00:44:33.28 billets eight miles away where they remained overnight in the following day. The attack was considered
00:44:33.28 --> 00:44:39.60 a success but private far had not taken part in the operation. His final nervous collapse took
00:44:39.60 --> 00:44:46.40 place on September 17th. Harriet fallen out sick on September 16th yet when he made his way to
00:44:46.40 --> 00:44:53.12 addressing station the following day he was not seen because he was not wounded. On September 17th
00:44:53.12 --> 00:44:58.32 he was ordered to the front in the company of a rations party but was found at 11 PM that night
00:44:58.32 --> 00:45:05.36 at the same place behind the lines having disobeyed the order. When he was subsequently sent to
00:45:05.36 --> 00:45:11.92 the front under escort he struggled with his guards and was released after refusing to see a
00:45:11.92 --> 00:45:17.12 medical officer further forward. Harry ran back towards the transport lines in the rear and was
00:45:17.12 --> 00:45:22.000 held under guard before being placed under arrest on September 18th and charged with cowardice.
00:45:24.64 --> 00:45:29.68 The timing of his collapse ahead of the impending attack may have helped along the decision to
00:45:29.68 --> 00:45:37.84 charge him. The battle of the song resulted in the greatest loss of life in military history at
00:45:37.84 --> 00:45:45.76 the time for negligible gains. Across the whole offensive during that awful summer and autumn
00:45:45.76 --> 00:45:52.64 between July 1st and November 19th British Army suffered 420,000 casualties. The French
00:45:52.64 --> 00:45:58.56 195,000 and the German losses stood between 500 and 650,000.
00:45:58.56 --> 00:46:08.80 So the massive fighting that was going on at the battle of song was also reflected in the fact
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:19.68 that there being super hostile towards him. On October 2nd, 1916, private Harry Far
00:46:19.68 --> 00:46:31.28 stood trial by field general court martial which was convened atville Serenke in France.
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:37.76 Since his nervous collapse and arrest, his battalion had again been an action following their
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:46.88 part in the success in the capture of the quadrilateral. This time they had helped attack and take
00:46:46.88 --> 00:46:54.64 the village of libuffs on September 25th part of the wider battle of more fall. It was against
00:46:54.64 --> 00:47:02.24 this backdrop of missing two significant actions that Harry was tried. A field general court
00:47:02.24 --> 00:47:10.08 martial was a wartime disciplinary tribunal with the power to try all military offenses. So obviously,
00:47:10.08 --> 00:47:15.68 you know these guys are they're not looking to hear about your excuses of why you can't
00:47:15.68 --> 00:47:19.92 get after it with the rest of the troops and the rest of the troops are going forward.
00:47:20.48 --> 00:47:25.60 The rest of the troops are going forward and they're fighting and they're fighting hard and
00:47:25.60 --> 00:47:31.04 they're making incredible sacrifices. Something that he wasn't physically able to do at this
00:47:31.04 --> 00:47:36.56 point. He was de-losted. He had seen too much, he had done too much and he was done.
00:47:36.56 --> 00:47:49.92 So they're sending him to court martial. Harry was charged with an offense contrary to section
00:47:49.92 --> 00:47:58.32 for seven of the army act of 1881. The exact charge was misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner
00:47:58.32 --> 00:48:07.68 as to show cowardice to which he pleaded not guilty. He Harry appeared without a prisoner's friend.
00:48:07.68 --> 00:48:14.08 So there was no there was no like lawyer to defend him. It was just him. Just him.
00:48:16.08 --> 00:48:22.96 Assess the overall situation captain Whitlow said, I cannot say what has destroyed this man's
00:48:22.96 --> 00:48:28.40 nerves, but he has proved himself on many occasions incapable of keeping his head in action and
00:48:28.40 --> 00:48:34.72 likely to cause a panic. However, the officer made a point of differentiating between these problems
00:48:34.72 --> 00:48:39.68 and the unfortunate soldiers nature, saying apart from his behavior, his conduct and character
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:43.68 are very good. So he's got one person that comes forward and says, hey, he's not a bad guy.
00:48:43.68 --> 00:48:54.40 He's just he's just lost it right now. Because he did a fair amount of fighting. The next piece of
00:48:54.40 --> 00:49:01.52 evidence was signed by W William the Batangans medical officer. He wrote, I hear by certified
00:49:01.52 --> 00:49:10.48 that I examined private Harry far first Batangan, York's on October 2, 1916 and that in my opinion,
00:49:10.48 --> 00:49:16.64 both the general physical and mental condition or satisfactory. Interestingly, the word good
00:49:16.64 --> 00:49:23.60 appears before the word satisfactory, but is struck out by the same hand, indicating some doubts
00:49:23.60 --> 00:49:28.48 in the officer's mind. The trial began formally with a prosecution witness,
00:49:28.48 --> 00:49:38.24 regimental Sergeant Major H. Laking, who said on 17 September 1916, about 9 a.m. the accused
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:44.48 reported himself to me at a line transport. He states that he was sick and had fallen out from
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:48.96 the company, the night previous on the march up to the trenches. He states he could not find
00:49:48.96 --> 00:49:53.68 his company commander for permission to fall out. I ordered him to report to the dressing station.
00:49:53.68 --> 00:49:58.48 When he returns, he states that they would not see him and as he was not wounded. I then ordered
00:49:58.48 --> 00:50:03.28 him to proceed to the Batangan with the ration party, which was going in the evening. The
00:50:03.28 --> 00:50:09.20 ration party paraded about 8 p.m. the accused was present and marched off with it on the arrival
00:50:09.20 --> 00:50:16.88 at the ration dump company quartermaster Sergeant Booth reported to me that the accused was missing.
00:50:16.88 --> 00:50:24.80 On returning to the first line for about 11 p.m. I saw the accused standing near a brazier.
00:50:25.92 --> 00:50:32.40 I asked him why he was there. He replies, I cannot stand it. I asked him what he meant. He again
00:50:32.40 --> 00:50:38.08 replies, I cannot stand it. I told him he would have to go to the trenches that night. He replies,
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:48.72 I cannot go. I order company quartermaster Sergeant Booth to take him up to the trenches under
00:50:48.72 --> 00:50:54.000 escort after going 500 yards. The accused commences to scream and struggle with his escort. I
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.04 again warned him that he would have to go to the trenches or be tried for cowardice. He replied,
00:50:59.04 --> 00:51:05.52 I am not fit to go to the trenches. I then said I would take him to see a medical officer. He refused
00:51:05.52 --> 00:51:10.96 to go saying, I will not go any further that way. I ordered the escort to take him on.
00:51:11.76 --> 00:51:14.72 The accused started to get struggling and screaming.
00:51:19.20 --> 00:51:23.84 So they were actually want to take him to a medical officer that's further forward and he's not going.
00:51:23.84 --> 00:51:31.12 He's done. The second witness to be called was company quartermaster Sergeant J.W. Booth
00:51:31.12 --> 00:51:38.72 of the first battalion west Yorkshire regimen. He says on September 17, 1916,
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:43.92 about 3 p.m. I ordered the accused to parade with the carrying party at 6 p.m. to go up and
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:48.56 join his company in the trenches. The accused paraded and marched off with the ration party
00:51:48.56 --> 00:51:53.60 on arrival at the ration dump. The accused was absent having fallen out on the way without permission.
00:51:54.96 --> 00:52:00.72 About 9 p.m. I saw the accused near the first line transport. The regimental sergeant major
00:52:00.72 --> 00:52:06.16 ordered me to take the accused with the escort to the trenches. About 500 yards from the first line
00:52:06.16 --> 00:52:11.76 transport. The accused became violent, threatened the escort and eventually broke away, returning
00:52:11.76 --> 00:52:16.88 to the first line transport. The regimental sergeant major ordered me to place the accused
00:52:16.88 --> 00:52:27.84 in charge of a guard. Those stories kind of line up. The third witness was private D. Ferrar,
00:52:28.56 --> 00:52:34.32 who also appears to have survived the war. He said on September 17, 1916, about 1130 p.m. I was
00:52:34.32 --> 00:52:39.76 ordered by company quartermaster sergeant Booth to form part of an escort to take the accused
00:52:39.76 --> 00:52:44.32 up to his company in the trenches. After going about 500 yards, the accused started struggling and
00:52:44.32 --> 00:52:49.76 saying he wanted to see a doctor. The sergeant major said he would see one when he got a bit further
00:52:49.76 --> 00:52:54.48 up. The accused refused to go any further. I tried to pull him along. The sergeant major told
00:52:54.48 --> 00:52:57.84 me to let him go and the accused went back to the first line transport.
00:53:01.04 --> 00:53:08.72 So there's the perspective of the folks that were with private far and here is private far's
00:53:08.72 --> 00:53:17.20 defense. This is what he had to say about the situation. On 16th September 1916, when going up to
00:53:17.20 --> 00:53:21.76 the trenches with my company, I fell out sick. I could not find the company officer to obtain
00:53:21.76 --> 00:53:27.84 permission. The sergeant I asked has now been wounded. I went back to the first line transport
00:53:27.84 --> 00:53:34.80 arriving there about 2 a.m. on 17th September 1916. I would have reported at once the regimental
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:41.04 sergeant major only I was told he was a sleep. I reported about 9 a.m. on 17th September.
00:53:41.04 --> 00:53:46.56 The sergeant major told me to go to the advanced dressing station. They, however, would not see
00:53:46.56 --> 00:53:52.56 me as I was not wounded. The sergeant major told me to go up with the ration party at night.
00:53:52.56 --> 00:53:59.28 I started with this party and had to fall out sick. I could not get permission as I was in the
00:53:59.28 --> 00:54:05.92 rear and the sergeant major was in the front, but left word with a private soldier. I returned to
00:54:05.92 --> 00:54:13.52 the first line transport hoping to report sick to some medical officer there. On the sergeant
00:54:13.52 --> 00:54:21.60 majors returned, I reported to him and said I was sick and I could not stand it. He then said,
00:54:21.60 --> 00:54:28.000 you are a fucking coward and you will go to the trenches. I give fuck all for my life and I give
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:37.04 fuck all for yours and you'll get fucking well shot. The sergeant major company quarter master
00:54:37.04 --> 00:54:42.80 booth and private Ferrari then took me toward the trenches. We went about a mile when we met a
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:50.48 carrying party returning from returning under Lance Corporal Form. The sergeant major asked Lance
00:54:50.48 --> 00:54:57.68 Corporal Form where I was and he replied run away same as last night. I said to sergeant major,
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:05.76 you have got this all made up for me. The sergeant major then told Lance Corporal Form to fall out
00:55:05.76 --> 00:55:11.68 two men and take me to the trenches. They commenced to shove me. I told them not to as I was sick
00:55:11.68 --> 00:55:17.92 enough as it was. The sergeant major then grabbed my rifle and said, I'll blow your fucking
00:55:17.92 --> 00:55:24.64 brains out if you don't go. I then called out for an officer but there was none. I was then tripped
00:55:24.64 --> 00:55:29.36 up and commenced to struggle after this. I do not know what happened until I found myself back
00:55:29.36 --> 00:55:36.72 in the first line transport under a guard. If the escort had not started to shove me about,
00:55:36.72 --> 00:55:48.40 I would have gone up to the trenches. It was on account of their doing this that I commenced to struggle.
00:55:48.40 --> 00:55:54.16 After the statement, Harry is cross-examine by the courts, prosecutor who asked if he had had the
00:55:54.16 --> 00:56:00.32 opportunity of reporting six since September 16th. Harry replied, yes, after I was put a
00:56:00.32 --> 00:56:08.32 under arrest on 18 September. A member of the court marshal then asked why he had not reported sick
00:56:08.32 --> 00:56:16.000 since his first arrest to which he replied, faithfully, because being away from the shell fire,
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:25.04 I felt better. Evidence to as to the character of private far was presented to the court,
00:56:25.04 --> 00:56:33.84 the battalion's agitent, Lieutenant W. Paul stated that he knew Harry for six weeks. He said
00:56:33.84 --> 00:56:39.28 on working parties, he has three times asked for leave to fall out and returned to camp as he could
00:56:39.28 --> 00:56:46.48 not stand the noise of our the artillery. He was trembling and did not appear to be in a fit state.
00:56:46.48 --> 00:56:57.44 So Harry had spent four years in the service of his country two years before the war and two
00:56:57.44 --> 00:57:03.28 years during it, the private soldier took part in a number of actions with his infantry battalion.
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:10.40 Most notably the battle of Louis Vais Chappelle. It was one of the most intense and
00:57:10.40 --> 00:57:16.64 traditional chapters of the entire conflict on the western front. One of the first examples of the whole
00:57:16.64 --> 00:57:23.20 sail slaughter of British troops for which the first world war has become renowned. Within months,
00:57:23.20 --> 00:57:28.40 he was in the hospital, his nerve shattered with a diagnosis of shell shock.
00:57:31.60 --> 00:57:37.04 Yet he returned to the front in October of 1915 and fought on for another 11 months,
00:57:37.04 --> 00:57:41.28 with two more spells of sickness because of his shell shock.
00:57:45.52 --> 00:57:52.56 According to Chris Walsh in the cowardice of brief history as World War I dragged on,
00:57:52.56 --> 00:57:59.68 Captain Charles Wilson of the Royal Army Medical Corps observed fear was no longer an occasional
00:57:59.68 --> 00:58:10.000 exotic visitor but a settler in our midst. It's cumulative effect, lead Wilson,
00:58:11.36 --> 00:58:16.000 later Lord Moran, which was Sir Winston Churchill's personal doctor,
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.24 to think that a man's ability to hold up against it, his courage was not absolute quality of his
00:58:22.24 --> 00:58:27.36 character but something he had a certain amount of like money in a bank account and which could
00:58:27.36 --> 00:58:32.72 be depleted slowly or suddenly by the hardships and horrors of war.
00:58:35.68 --> 00:58:42.32 Harry Far had reached the limit of his endurance and could go no further.
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:53.84 And so the trial was over. There was no lawyer, no soldiers friend, no support.
00:58:53.84 --> 00:59:02.96 And there was no mercy. Back to the book, the wording on the charge sheet was stark.
00:59:05.28 --> 00:59:14.08 Under a column entitled, finding and if convicted sentence, two words were handwritten in pencil.
00:59:14.08 --> 00:59:36.48 Guilty death. There was no right to an appeal. In late 1916, a telegram arrived for Gertrude Far
00:59:36.48 --> 00:59:44.64 from the war office. Opening the envelope with trembling hands in a fumping heart,
00:59:44.64 --> 00:59:50.16 she read the bold type written message that realized her worst fears.
00:59:54.24 --> 01:00:02.64 Harry Far had died in France, but not in battle or of wounds sustained under fire.
01:00:02.64 --> 01:00:12.24 Re-reading it in disbelief, Gertrude learned that her husband had been executed by firing squad.
01:00:15.12 --> 01:00:24.000 The stark message read, we regret to inform you that Harry Thomas Far of the first West Yorkshire
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.68 Regiment has been shot for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy.
01:00:40.64 --> 01:00:45.52 Shot for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy.
01:00:45.52 --> 01:00:59.12 Unfortunately, he was not the only one. There were 351 men executed by the British Army during
01:00:59.12 --> 01:01:05.68 World War I and more than 300 of those. Just over 300 of those were for their
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:20.24 supposed cowardice. There was a book called Shot at Don by Julian Pockowski and Julian Sikes.
01:01:22.08 --> 01:01:26.24 It's called Shot at Don because that was generally when these executions were carried out.
01:01:26.24 --> 01:01:34.64 They were carried out in the early morning. It details some of those men that actually
01:01:34.64 --> 01:01:42.56 details all the men and their deaths and provide some insight from some of the people that were there
01:01:44.24 --> 01:01:48.56 during these horrible times. So I'm going to go to that book.
01:01:55.60 --> 01:02:01.76 The first sentence of death imposed on a soldier of the BEF, which is the British Expeditionary
01:02:01.76 --> 01:02:07.76 Forces was carried out in the fifth week of the war. The condemned soldier was private Thomas
01:02:07.76 --> 01:02:14.88 Hygate from Kent. He had been born in the little village of Shoreham near Soven Oaks,
01:02:14.88 --> 01:02:21.44 Seven Oaks, and had joined the Army in February 1913, like many who enlisted for regular Army
01:02:21.44 --> 01:02:29.36 service, the latter joined up at the age of 17. After less than two weeks in action, the
01:02:29.36 --> 01:02:34.80 private deserted on the day that he went missing. His battalion had started to move northwards
01:02:34.80 --> 01:02:41.92 advancing. Hygate, who's wearing civilian clothing, was discovered by a gamekeeper, hiding in a barn.
01:02:41.92 --> 01:02:46.72 His uniform is concealed nearby. When questioned, he said, I want to get out of it,
01:02:46.72 --> 01:02:52.88 and this is how I'm going to do it. Not surprisingly private, Hygate was found guilty.
01:02:52.88 --> 01:03:02.56 The sentence imposed was that he would suffer death by being shot. 17-year-old kid
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.76 in March 1952 soldiers from one West Yorkshire Regiment were convicted of desertion,
01:03:13.76 --> 01:03:18.16 and then were shot within a few days of each other. The first Lance Corp.
01:03:18.16 --> 01:03:24.08 The first Lance Corp. Alfred Atkinson, deserted whilst in rest. The battalion being under orders
01:03:24.08 --> 01:03:29.36 to proceed to the front. In January of that year, Atkinson had won a sum of money gambling.
01:03:30.08 --> 01:03:35.04 And after about a drinking, subsequently deserted. After three weeks, he was then arrested
01:03:35.04 --> 01:03:41.36 by the military police. At his trial, the court was told that Atkinson was a good soldier,
01:03:41.36 --> 01:03:46.24 and previously of excellent character, as a result, his sentence bore a recommendation to
01:03:46.24 --> 01:03:51.28 mercy. A soldier serving with the battalion at the time later confirmed his opinion, saying that Atkinson
01:03:51.28 --> 01:03:56.88 was clean, smart, brave soldier represented by all, or respected by all his comrades.
01:03:58.48 --> 01:04:04.88 When General Sir Horus Smith-Dorian reviewed the proceedings, he was of the opinion that an example
01:04:04.88 --> 01:04:08.24 was required. And the sentence was confirmed.
01:04:08.24 --> 01:04:20.40 And here's an eyewitness of an account, the two men, and this is labor MP Ernst Thurdle.
01:04:21.60 --> 01:04:27.60 The two men I selected for the firing party went with the accident. When they came back,
01:04:28.80 --> 01:04:35.12 tough characters, though they were supposed to be, they were sick. They screamed in their sleep.
01:04:35.12 --> 01:04:40.56 They vomited immediately after eating. All they could say was, the site was horrible,
01:04:40.56 --> 01:04:44.56 made more so by the fact that we had shot one of our own men.
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:56.96 Private Abraham Beveresteen was the only son of an East End family, because it was considered
01:04:56.96 --> 01:05:04.16 dishonorable in certain Jewish circles to be a soldier. Beveresteen had signed up under the false
01:05:04.16 --> 01:05:13.52 name of Harris. 1915 Christmas Eve, private Beveresteen was wounded. In the back, he was admitted to the
01:05:13.52 --> 01:05:19.36 hospital, suffering from these wounds and also from shock. In his letters home, private Beveresteen told
01:05:19.36 --> 01:05:24.48 of his progress in the hospital, that he had been detained there since 19 January 1916,
01:05:24.48 --> 01:05:30.80 because he had developed a pressure sword on his heel. First January 1916, dear mother.
01:05:30.80 --> 01:05:36.08 I'm very sorry that it did not write before now, but we were in the trenches on Christmas Day,
01:05:36.08 --> 01:05:41.60 and we had a lot to do. Also, I was taken ill and was sent to the hospital. I'm feeling a little
01:05:41.60 --> 01:05:46.08 better so don't get upset. Also don't send any letters to the company, because I won't get them.
01:05:46.72 --> 01:05:50.32 Also, you cannot send any letters to the hospital, as I won't get them. Dear mother,
01:05:50.32 --> 01:05:56.56 do not worry, I will be all right. Hoping all of you are getting on well. I was only hurt in the back.
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:01.60 I will try to send you letters every few days if I can to let you know how I am getting on. We
01:06:01.60 --> 01:06:06.24 get plenty of food in the hospital. Dear mother, I know it will break your heart this,
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:12.40 but don't be upset about it. I will be all right, but I would very much like to see you. I will
01:06:12.40 --> 01:06:27.44 try my very best. He did recover and he went back to the front. On 13 February, the soldier had
01:06:27.44 --> 01:06:32.08 left his position in the front line trenches and made his way to one of the company headquarters
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:36.40 in the rear. He reported to his company, quartermaster sergeant and stated that a grenade had
01:06:36.40 --> 01:06:40.48 burst very close to him and that he was suffering from shock, believing him to be a nervous
01:06:40.48 --> 01:06:47.60 condition. This NCO told Harris to report the medical officer, Beverestein reported to the medical
01:06:47.60 --> 01:06:51.60 officer who examined him, but found nothing wrong. As a result, the private was ordered to return
01:06:51.60 --> 01:06:57.12 to the trenches. Beverestein, however, did not obey, but made his way to a farmhouse in the rear
01:06:57.12 --> 01:07:01.68 where he took refuge. Shortly thereafter, whilst warming himself by a fire and officer,
01:07:01.68 --> 01:07:06.88 from another regiment came into the farmhouse and suspecting that Beverestein was a deserter placed
01:07:06.88 --> 01:07:12.96 the lad under arrest. The letter sent home, indicated that Beverestein was in trouble, but did not
01:07:12.96 --> 01:07:17.44 disclose the serious nature of his predicament. Clearly as a soldier did not realize that his life
01:07:17.44 --> 01:07:22.56 was at stake, but the letters relate that at the time of his desertion, the private had been feeling
01:07:22.56 --> 01:07:29.36 unwell. 23 February, 1916, dear mother, we were in the trenches and I was ill, so I went out and
01:07:29.36 --> 01:07:34.40 they took me to prison and I am in bed of trouble now and I won't get any money for a long time.
01:07:34.40 --> 01:07:39.28 I will have to go to the front, go in front of a court. I will try my best to get out of it, so don't
01:07:39.28 --> 01:07:44.48 worry, but dear mother tried to send some money, not very much, but try your best. I will let you know
01:07:45.28 --> 01:07:50.96 in my next how I got on, give my best love to mother, father, and Kate, your loving son,
01:07:52.24 --> 01:07:58.16 Abby. On March 4th, when he was court, Marshall, private members didn't explain that on the
01:07:58.16 --> 01:08:05.04 day of his absence. A grenade had exploded beside him and this had been more than his nerves could stand.
01:08:05.04 --> 01:08:10.08 He added that he had then lost control. The court was unimpressed by this story and in spite of
01:08:10.08 --> 01:08:16.32 an unblemished record, the soldier was sentenced to death. And the finding was confirmed by the
01:08:16.32 --> 01:08:21.60 commander in chief, private Beverestein's parents were left unaware of their son's predicament.
01:08:21.60 --> 01:08:25.36 The next communication which they received came from the army. It was an official
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:33.36 army form which carried a blunt message. Sir, I am directed to inform you that a report has been
01:08:33.36 --> 01:08:39.60 received from the war office to the effect that private Harris A11th Battalion Middle Sex Regiment.
01:08:39.60 --> 01:08:46.48 G.S. was signed with sentence after trial by court Marshall to suffer death by being shot for
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:55.92 desertion and the sentence was duly executed on 20 March 1916. Another one and again, this book is
01:08:56.64 --> 01:09:01.44 details every single soldier. You know, picking out some of the ones that stood out a bit to me.
01:09:03.36 --> 01:09:09.76 The next soldier concerned was rifleman Albert Parker serving with seven King's Royal
01:09:10.32 --> 01:09:14.88 rifle. Corne has crime as typical example of desertion committed with the intention of avoiding
01:09:14.88 --> 01:09:20.08 service in the line 35 year old Parker admitted drunkeness at his trial, but this did not mitigate
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:26.48 his offense. And I witnessed later recalled the promulgation of sentence and the execution that
01:09:26.48 --> 01:09:34.48 followed. Then the prisoner's cap was taken off. And he was told to take one pace forward, which he did.
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.08 The APM commenced to read the papers. The man was then told to take a pace back again,
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:48.000 which he did without a quiver. A brave man at that moment wasn't to be found in France.
01:09:48.72 --> 01:09:51.52 He was then marched away to the place where he was to be shot.
01:09:54.40 --> 01:10:00.80 We were then ordered to about turn and the brigade transport officer threatened us that any man
01:10:00.80 --> 01:10:08.48 who turned around would be put on a crime. So we stood in silence for what seemed hours, although
01:10:08.48 --> 01:10:16.08 only minutes. Then the shots rang out. And one of the Yorkshire's fainid, the strain was that great.
01:10:16.08 --> 01:10:22.56 Still we stood in silence until we heard another shot, which I afterwards ascertained was the doctor's
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:26.16 shot to make sure he was dead.
01:10:26.16 --> 01:10:39.52 Private Phillips of one cold stream guards was executed for desertion. The clergymen who attended
01:10:39.52 --> 01:10:47.84 private Phillips was Captain T. Guy Rogers, chaplain to the second guards brigade. The clergyman
01:10:47.84 --> 01:10:55.76 documented his feelings in what he clearly regarded as a most harring or deal. 31 May 1916
01:10:55.76 --> 01:10:58.88 Sha'alai tell you over the terrible experience I've just gone through.
01:11:00.32 --> 01:11:06.08 If so, it must not go beyond the family circle of yourself and the hauslums.
01:11:07.36 --> 01:11:14.72 It is just fallen to my lot to prepare a deserter for his death. That meant breaking the news to him,
01:11:14.72 --> 01:11:19.52 helping him with his last letters, passing the night with him on the straw in his cell,
01:11:19.52 --> 01:11:27.92 and trying to prepare his soul for meeting God. The execution and bearing him immediately.
01:11:29.68 --> 01:11:33.84 The shadow was just hanging over me when I wrote the last letter, but I tried to keep it out.
01:11:33.84 --> 01:11:40.40 Monday night I was with him Tuesday morning at 3.30. He was shot. He laid beside me for hours with his
01:11:40.40 --> 01:11:46.48 hand in mind. Poor fellow. It was a bad case, but he met his end bravely and drinking all I could
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:51.92 teach him about God, his father, Jesus' savior and the reality of the forgiveness of sins.
01:11:53.76 --> 01:11:59.92 I feel shaken by it all, but my nerves thank God have not troubled me. Everyone has been so kind
01:11:59.92 --> 01:12:05.60 who knew of the ordeal. I will tell you some more some other time. I want to get it off and away
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:19.76 from the thought of it as much as I can. Here's a few guys that deserted together in a group
01:12:19.76 --> 01:12:26.32 Lance Sergeant Joseph Stone's Lance Corporal Peter Goggins and Lance Corporal John McDonald.
01:12:30.32 --> 01:12:35.36 In the new year when Sir Douglas Hay came to review the sentences he committed. Those imposed
01:12:35.36 --> 01:12:39.60 on the four private, so there's four private with these guys, these guys were the leaders of this
01:12:39.60 --> 01:12:46.24 group that deserted, which were suspended. But an eyewitness account recorded the final moments of
01:12:46.24 --> 01:12:53.44 the three condemned NCOs shot on 18 January. Come out you ordered the Corporal of the Guard to me.
01:12:53.44 --> 01:12:58.48 I crawled forth. It was snowing heavily. Stand here. He said pushing me between two centuries. Quick
01:12:58.48 --> 01:13:05.60 march. And the way we went, not as I dreaded to my first taste of packed drill, but out and up a
01:13:05.60 --> 01:13:14.88 long street to an R.E. dump. There the police Corporal handed in a chit, where upon three posts,
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:20.88 three roast ropes, and a spade were given to me to carry back. Our return journey took us past
01:13:20.88 --> 01:13:25.68 the guard room up a short hill until we reached the secluded spot surrounded by trees.
01:13:25.68 --> 01:13:32.16 Certain measurements were made in the snow after which I was ordered to dig three holes as
01:13:32.16 --> 01:13:43.12 stipulated distances apart. I began to wonder, could it be? No, perhaps spies. Perhaps,
01:13:43.12 --> 01:13:51.28 so perhaps only my fancy. The next scene appears, and we colded on. A crowd of brass hats,
01:13:51.28 --> 01:13:57.60 the medical officer, and three firing parties. Three stakes a few yards apart, and a ring of
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:05.60 centuries around the woodmen to keep the curious away. The motor ambulance arrives conveying the
01:14:05.60 --> 01:14:11.92 doomed men, mannicked and blindfolded. They are helped out and tied up to the stakes.
01:14:14.32 --> 01:14:20.64 Over each man's heart is placed in envelope. At the sign of command, the firing
01:14:20.64 --> 01:14:29.44 parties 12 each align their rifles on the envelopes. The officer in charge holds his stick aloft,
01:14:31.44 --> 01:14:39.92 and as it falls, 36 bullets, usher the souls of three of Kishner's men to the great unknown.
01:14:42.56 --> 01:14:46.32 As a military prisoner, I helped clear the traces of the triple murder.
01:14:46.32 --> 01:14:54.40 I took the post down. I helped carry those bodies toward their last resting place. I collected
01:14:54.40 --> 01:15:02.16 all the bloods soaked, straw, and burnt it. Acting upon instructions, I took their belongings from
01:15:02.16 --> 01:15:10.64 the dead men's tunics discarded before being shot. A few letters, a pipe, some fags, a photo.
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:18.88 I could tell you of the silence of the military police after reading one letter from a little
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:29.04 girl to dear daddy. Another private David Stevenson, when Sensing Danger, the soldier had run off
01:15:29.04 --> 01:15:33.20 when questioned the private that lied saying that he was working for another town mayor,
01:15:34.24 --> 01:15:39.68 unfortunately for Stevenson, he was already under suspected. Suspended sentence for previous
01:15:39.68 --> 01:15:46.000 offense of dissurtion. The recollections of an ex sergeant who had been in charge of the firing
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.52 squad, who shot private Stevenson or published after the war. It was a terrible scene.
01:15:52.88 --> 01:15:58.56 Being that I knew him made it worse for me. The ten men were selected for the firing squad
01:15:58.56 --> 01:16:05.68 from a few details left out of the line. They were nervous to wreck themselves and two of them had
01:16:05.68 --> 01:16:11.76 not the nerve to fire. Of course, they were tried by court martial, but they were found to be
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:18.80 medically unfit. Their nerves had gone. The last words, the lad said were, what will my mother say?
01:16:24.24 --> 01:16:31.52 You have one more. This was an interesting writing. There was a private, name, private,
01:16:31.52 --> 01:16:39.76 Frederick Butcher and the report that comes out was actually published in a newspaper
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:46.96 years after the execution, but he calls the private Frederick Butcher. He calls him Jim.
01:16:48.16 --> 01:16:54.48 But this eyewitness to his execution wrote about it in a paper.
01:16:54.48 --> 01:17:04.96 I shall call him Jim. He had been out three years. He had been wounded, but he was wounded at
01:17:04.96 --> 01:17:08.88 time when wounded were cared for in France and were back in the line in six weeks.
01:17:10.88 --> 01:17:15.60 There was nothing about Jim which attracted special attention. He was the average,
01:17:15.60 --> 01:17:20.88 happy go lucky sort of lad who did the day's work on an average in the average way.
01:17:20.88 --> 01:17:26.40 War had become normal to him and he had settled down to that fatalism
01:17:27.20 --> 01:17:34.32 which characterized so many of our men when they said, if it is to be, it will, and if it ain't,
01:17:35.04 --> 01:17:42.40 it won't. As if he had suddenly been hit in the mind, he stood stock still to
01:17:42.40 --> 01:17:49.36 still one night and point blank refused to go over with a rating party. In an instant,
01:17:49.36 --> 01:17:55.76 he became a marked man. His comrades could not quite determine whether it was bravery or idiocy.
01:17:56.96 --> 01:18:03.92 Perhaps some string had snapped. Some, something somewhere had gone wrong,
01:18:04.72 --> 01:18:10.88 but Jim just refused. He was exceedingly nervous, but such a breach of discipline was in itself
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:17.60 sufficient to account for that. By the time he stood on the map before the court,
01:18:17.60 --> 01:18:22.64 he had partly regained his normal composure, but the seriousness of the situation had washed away
01:18:22.64 --> 01:18:26.32 the color from his face and there was a dull, laden looking his blue eyes.
01:18:29.12 --> 01:18:36.24 His record saved him. It was good and his judges tempered judgment with mercy and consideration.
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:43.92 He had been many, he had had many, many, many captains and all, and with all he had done as bit.
01:18:43.92 --> 01:18:49.76 That the court gave him a chance. He made no excuse whatsoever, but when question,
01:18:49.76 --> 01:18:54.24 but when asked the question, he promised that it would not occur again.
01:18:57.20 --> 01:19:03.44 A week later, it did occur again. And the next court sentenced him to death.
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:10.72 Blind folded with his hands tied behind him, he was to be shot at dawn the following day.
01:19:10.72 --> 01:19:19.60 From the death century, Jim learned the names of the officer and men who would ascend him
01:19:19.60 --> 01:19:28.16 west next morning. They were all his friends. Two or three officers who had known him for years
01:19:28.16 --> 01:19:34.08 went into the death hut and said goodbye, somehow none of them could quite catalog Jim as a coward.
01:19:34.08 --> 01:19:43.44 Terrible things happen in war, but nothing perhaps is more terrible than to send one of
01:19:44.48 --> 01:19:50.32 your own out of life when you are not quite sure whether he is a coward or a marker.
01:19:52.56 --> 01:19:57.76 The world will never know the real truth. There was no psychologist there to give an opinion.
01:19:57.76 --> 01:20:04.56 Even if there had been, it might not have altered the course of events. Discipline even then might
01:20:04.56 --> 01:20:15.28 have won an unfair victory over science. In the mechanism of Jim's mentality, a cog slipped
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:24.24 and the wheels revolved irregularly. From what the CEO and Jim's pals told me,
01:20:24.24 --> 01:20:28.80 I am fully persuaded that Jim died as a marker to discipline.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:41.36 Jim was blindfolded. His hands were bound together behind him. As he stood there, calm and steady as a rock.
01:20:41.36 --> 01:20:53.36 The orders were given. Goodbye sir. Goodbye boys. He said, just as if you were off on a
01:20:53.36 --> 01:21:02.40 10-day for a low. There was no reply. The subaltern was choked with emotion and the firing squad
01:21:02.40 --> 01:21:13.04 as heart-wrench as he dared not reply. The sharp crack of a volley smothered size of relief from the squad
01:21:13.04 --> 01:21:23.12 and all was over. All saved laying beneath the soil of France.
01:21:23.12 --> 01:21:40.80 There were Jim lies. There shall remain forever a little bit of England.
01:21:40.80 --> 01:22:03.52 Well, as I said, this is a awful thing. I'm sorry to have to bring it up and I'm sorry to
01:22:03.52 --> 01:22:14.96 have to talk about it. I'm sorry that we human beings are capable of this. And at the same time,
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.32 it's good to know what we are capable of so that we can prevent it.
01:22:22.32 --> 01:22:37.36 And eventually in 2006, after way too long and after a lot of effort and hard work by a lot of
01:22:37.36 --> 01:22:44.88 compassionate people, the British government admitted that it was wrong. And the story of that effort
01:22:44.88 --> 01:22:56.56 is retraced in the first book I read from he was no coward and it resulted in the pardon of Harry
01:22:56.56 --> 01:23:10.32 Far and of 306 of the other soldiers who were executed, who were shot at dawn for the crime of having
01:23:10.32 --> 01:23:18.56 psychological breakdown under the immense mental and physical trauma of World War I.
01:23:21.60 --> 01:23:30.48 And in 2006, Harry Far's daughter, Gerdi, who we started this story off with. Gerdi was presented
01:23:30.48 --> 01:23:40.48 with a letter from the secretary defense Desmond Brown, which included the official pardon for Harry
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:49.60 Far and it reads, this document records that private Harry Far of the first battalion of the West
01:23:49.60 --> 01:23:58.72 Yorkshire Regiment, who is executed for cowardice on 18 October 1916, his pardoned under section 359
01:23:58.72 --> 01:24:10.32 of the Armed Forces Act of 2006. The pardon stands as recognition that he was one of many victims
01:24:10.32 --> 01:24:17.12 of the first World War and that execution was not a fate he deserved.
01:24:17.12 --> 01:24:28.16 Signed Desmond Brown, secretary of state, four defense.
01:24:33.28 --> 01:24:42.80 And so he was pardoned and I would say that private Harry Far we, we beg your pardon.
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:55.12 And I would say let us learn something from this something about leadership and something
01:24:55.12 --> 01:25:02.56 about our behavior as human beings, our nature as human beings, let us learn something
01:25:02.56 --> 01:25:16.24 from the fate of Harry Far. And that is that we as human beings are not in foul, but we are not
01:25:16.24 --> 01:25:24.56 perfect and we will fall short of the ideals that we aspire to. We'll fall short of those.
01:25:24.56 --> 01:25:33.28 And we may not always be as bold and we may not always be as heroic and we may not always be as
01:25:33.28 --> 01:25:45.12 brave as we want, but while we may fall short on those traits, let us never fall short
01:25:45.12 --> 01:26:03.92 in compassion, in sympathy and in understanding. And let us when we look to judge others,
01:26:03.92 --> 01:26:14.08 let us remember and let us know that our judgment is as imperfect as we are.
01:26:16.40 --> 01:26:25.60 And remember that it is us who in the words of Wilford Owens,
01:26:25.60 --> 01:26:42.72 we are the ones that dealt them war and madness. And so let us also be the ones who deal them mercy
01:26:42.72 --> 01:27:01.20 and forgiveness. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo Charles.
01:27:03.60 --> 01:27:12.40 Kind of a ruffling. Yeah. Odd. It's like an odd feeling, just that even that
01:27:12.40 --> 01:27:24.40 final part of that last book. You know, you got to essentially kill or witness both your friend
01:27:25.52 --> 01:27:32.56 and even until that. It's not like you guys are friends. He betrays you, you know, and you're
01:27:32.56 --> 01:27:37.76 mad at him and then you kill him. It's not that. It's like, yeah, some other thing kind of happened.
01:27:37.76 --> 01:27:43.84 Meanwhile, you're still friends. And then you got to be a part of in whatever way. Like right
01:27:43.84 --> 01:27:49.84 in front of this face too, like him dying. And the kind where you're literally saying bye.
01:27:50.48 --> 01:27:55.36 Hey, bye and then next one. Yeah. And yeah, just kind of, you know, when you think,
01:27:55.36 --> 01:28:01.28 you read these books, you have this picture in your mind, you know. And it's just it's so off
01:28:01.28 --> 01:28:06.000 putting just all the different facets that just come to play with a scenario like that.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.72 And there's, I mean, obviously, there's a, there's a huge dichotomy in this,
01:28:11.76 --> 01:28:19.36 is the huge dichotomy in this is that there's all these millions of brave soldiers
01:28:20.32 --> 01:28:28.96 that went that went over the top and they were killed. And so how can you have any sympathy for
01:28:28.96 --> 01:28:34.40 the people that are like, no, I can't do it. And the answer is you've got to recognize that
01:28:34.40 --> 01:28:40.32 different people are different. And, and you know, it's interesting that that last guy calls him a
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:46.48 marker. And the perspective that even someone that stood by him and someone that fought and took
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:52.88 the same risks and could have been killed himself and happened to live, he recognizes like, hey,
01:28:53.60 --> 01:29:00.48 yeah, this, this happens. And, you know, there's one part that kind of, when you would hear about
01:29:00.48 --> 01:29:05.68 this guy, the one guy gets rolled up or gets caught by some guy that's patrolling around the
01:29:05.68 --> 01:29:11.36 rear looking for desergers. It's like, yeah, when I hear about that guy, I can picture that guy,
01:29:11.36 --> 01:29:15.76 can picture that guy. He's in the rear. So, you know, you need more brave, get, get up to the front.
01:29:16.40 --> 01:29:23.36 Like, you can picture that guy. And that, that kind of makes me angry because you got somebody that's
01:29:23.36 --> 01:29:27.76 in the rear policing up people sending them to the front. Why don't you up on the front?
01:29:27.76 --> 01:29:36.80 Yeah, get up there yourself. But yeah, so there's a dichotomy to it in that, you know, you, you,
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:47.52 I mean, obviously you uphold and have the utmost respect for the bravery of the people that
01:29:47.52 --> 01:29:53.84 step up and, and they're on put them on the highest pedestal. And then you've got these people
01:29:53.84 --> 01:30:02.48 that contradict that. I think that the line gets drawn in the fact that these guys lose control.
01:30:02.48 --> 01:30:08.64 They can't do it. They can't do it anymore. They, they mentally can't take it. And again, you know,
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:13.28 it's the same thing that Dick Winner said, the same thing that Hackworth said, there's guys
01:30:13.28 --> 01:30:19.76 reach a limit and they're done. And only people that have been in extensive combat recognize
01:30:19.76 --> 01:30:24.40 that the people reach a point. And there's, there's that whole section in band of brothers,
01:30:24.40 --> 01:30:30.16 where that some of those guys that are total studs, they can't go anymore. They break down.
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:34.24 And Dick Winner's is like, okay, as a leader this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to do my
01:30:34.24 --> 01:30:39.12 best to take care of them. If they, if we can get them recovered, cool, if not respect,
01:30:39.12 --> 01:30:45.68 if not, hey, it's okay. You did what you could. Yeah. It's a, it's a strange dichotomy.
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:52.000 Yeah. And you can't help but try to imagine not necessarily the specific scenario, but like,
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.96 what is it, how does it feel to literally like not be able to do something? You know, like,
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:03.12 you, yeah, well, there's a lot of shame for these guys that that came home and they were shame
01:31:03.12 --> 01:31:07.84 that they weren't wounded. They weren't physically wounded. And, and the government treated them
01:31:07.84 --> 01:31:15.44 very badly in many cases. They look, oh, your cowards. And so it's awful. It's absolutely awful.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:22.72 It's why hate World War I. I hate World War I. Yeah. And that's a shoot. That's the thing, too.
01:31:22.72 --> 01:31:28.72 It's not like, you know, they're taking a spin class and they quit halfway through because they
01:31:28.72 --> 01:31:32.96 were too tired or something like that. This is no echo you are correct. They're not in this
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:40.24 spin class. This is World War I. By the way, like super treacherous, super. Yeah. And then you're like,
01:31:40.24 --> 01:31:45.68 oh, yeah, what? You don't have the guts or you don't, you're not brave enough for this. And then
01:31:45.68 --> 01:31:51.44 people, people back and back in the safety of call, call a judgment on, on guys that. And that's
01:31:51.44 --> 01:31:55.92 the other thing is these guys almost, every one of those guys, they had fought for some certain
01:31:55.92 --> 01:32:01.76 amount of time. They fought for six months, 12 months, a year, two years, whatever, they had fought
01:32:01.76 --> 01:32:11.84 and fought and they broke years. So, yeah, man. It's awful. It's awful. But, you know, I think it's
01:32:11.84 --> 01:32:16.16 something that if we can keep in perspective, because there's so much judging, you know what?
01:32:16.16 --> 01:32:21.76 I mean, people judge each other all the time. It's like, you know what? Take a wrap off your judgment.
01:32:22.56 --> 01:32:27.52 That was that was my, that was sort of what I was thinking through the whole time. I was thinking
01:32:27.52 --> 01:32:32.56 about how often am I judging someone. Yeah. You know, you know, you don't get the judge. You
01:32:32.56 --> 01:32:38.48 don't get the judge. You just, you just do, you worry about you. And, hey, instead of trying to
01:32:38.48 --> 01:32:43.52 judge, why don't you try and help someone? There's a novel idea. Instead of placing judgment on
01:32:43.52 --> 01:32:47.12 someone that's having a hard time with something, why don't you try and help them? Why don't you try
01:32:47.12 --> 01:32:52.40 and figure out how you can support them? Why don't you figure out what they need? It's
01:32:52.40 --> 01:32:56.16 think of anyone had that attitude. One person would have stepped up and said, hey, look,
01:32:56.16 --> 01:33:01.68 I know this guy. He was a good guy. Let me try and get him back in the game. Let me try and
01:33:01.68 --> 01:33:08.64 figure out what's wrong. Instead of everyone jumping on board, the judgment banned wagon. Yeah,
01:33:08.64 --> 01:33:13.52 it kind of seems like it's that feeling of like, I'm over here. You're over there. Like,
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:18.64 hey, I don't need that kind of help. So why should you kind of thing?
01:33:18.64 --> 01:33:27.76 Don't judge. Don't judge. All right. Well, instead of judging help, how's that? That's
01:33:27.76 --> 01:33:33.28 my motto. Yeah. Instead of placing judgment, how would you help someone out? Support somebody.
01:33:33.28 --> 01:33:40.24 Support. I like what you just did there. Speaking of which, how about let's go into some
01:33:40.24 --> 01:33:48.24 support. You know, support yourself before you go to that that opening poem by Wilford Owen is freaking legit.
01:33:49.76 --> 01:33:54.56 Freaking legit. And it's, I should read it again. I should have read it at the end or something.
01:33:55.12 --> 01:34:01.92 Go back and listen to it because it's it's it's it's a it's incredible poem from a guy that went
01:34:01.92 --> 01:34:07.84 through all that. He went into the psychological war. If it was called that, he went through the what
01:34:07.84 --> 01:34:12.32 would be it would have been called a psychological war at the time. And then he went back to the front.
01:34:12.32 --> 01:34:19.28 And then he was awarded for valor. And then he got killed. And he wrote that powerful powerful
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:26.24 poem. It's freaking awesome. So I had to throw that out there. Go back and listen to it. Yeah.
01:34:26.24 --> 01:34:34.48 It's really well. Support if you will. Back to support. Back to support.
01:34:34.48 --> 01:34:43.36 All right. Here are some outstanding ways to support yourself. And let's podcast. If you're down for that.
01:34:44.32 --> 01:34:50.08 First, origin. Okay. Origin is our company. I feel like it's everybody's company. Really?
01:34:50.08 --> 01:34:55.68 No, it's not. Well, let's say maybe now we can't include our international listeners on that.
01:34:55.68 --> 01:35:00.08 We can definitely include our American listeners. If you're an American listener if you're here in the
01:35:00.08 --> 01:35:07.04 good old US of A, origin is our company and you're including that. Yeah. And for sure. But I have been,
01:35:07.04 --> 01:35:14.32 you know, I've been hearing things that even people in the UK, they're waiting. They're open arms.
01:35:14.88 --> 01:35:20.000 When are we getting mock in the UK when, you know, they're asking these questions.
01:35:20.88 --> 01:35:26.48 So open arms. Boom. I think that it is it is or soon to become everyone's company. Yeah.
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:30.72 Check. It's just a kind of company. It is, it's faces. Just because everything's made in America,
01:35:30.72 --> 01:35:35.60 which I'll go into. Does it mean you have to be American to be true?
01:35:35.60 --> 01:35:41.60 Yeah. You could be, you could be down for just good treatment of the workers. Yeah.
01:35:41.60 --> 01:35:47.44 They're not in a sweat shop. No. They're actually in a, they're actually on one, one, twenty, five.
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:53.84 High Street. Okay. I don't know what it won 25 is, but I dig it. That's the address. Yeah. Yeah.
01:35:53.84 --> 01:36:03.20 But maybe that was some sort of a term. No. There wasn't some sort of a term. Anyway. Yes.
01:36:03.20 --> 01:36:06.64 Okay. Or did so. What do we got at origin? Okay. If you're on the Juditube app,
01:36:06.64 --> 01:36:11.76 if you're on the path and you do so is part of your specific situation.
01:36:11.76 --> 01:36:15.44 Boom. You're going to need a geek. You're going to want a geek. You don't need a geek.
01:36:15.44 --> 01:36:19.44 Don't need anything. This is what you're going to want. Big time. You kind of need a geek.
01:36:19.44 --> 01:36:23.52 If you're going to try and do Ditsa with a geek, you're going to need a geek. Well, yes.
01:36:23.52 --> 01:36:26.96 That's the show tonight. No. All right. Well, here you go. So you do need a geek.
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:32.16 You know, you don't need to train no geek. You're just too, but it is highly recommended.
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:38.88 In fact, it is an affirmative. You should train geek and no geek. Yes. So I would personally agree with that.
01:36:38.88 --> 01:36:45.68 Ge, no geek, due to both all everything. So therefore we can conclude we do need a geek. Yes.
01:36:45.68 --> 01:36:51.84 And if you're wondering what geek to get, boom, wonder, no more. Origin has geese all made in America by the way.
01:36:51.84 --> 01:37:00.80 But these are quality quality geese made from scratch, by the way, by origin for jiu jitsu specifically.

01:37:59.04 --> 01:38:04.32 Vitamin, vitamins are specific, but we'll say for lack of a term, vitamins for you,
01:38:04.32 --> 01:38:14.56 bring. Like a whole situation. And then you got milk, which is, which is glorious. It's a protein
01:38:14.56 --> 01:38:20.24 dessert fortified. Here's the thing, but okay. So here's the thing about milk, which I found out. If I
01:38:20.24 --> 01:38:25.44 keep finding these things out here, I'm not the kind, apparently I'm not the kind person who's like
01:38:25.44 --> 01:38:30.72 doing all the research. What benefits of this thing? Apparently, I thought I was that kind of
01:38:30.72 --> 01:38:34.80 percent. You started drinking it? Yeah, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, cool. I'll
01:38:34.80 --> 01:38:38.88 taste it. Boom. My taste it and taste like super good. So I'm like, okay. I'm in and then you
01:38:38.88 --> 01:38:44.40 tend you start to become in the mood for some milkshake. I'm milkshake. Yeah. milkshake.
01:38:45.60 --> 01:38:51.44 And so I'll be like, yeah, I'm kind of, here's what I did do. I did this a bunch of times in a row.
01:38:51.44 --> 01:38:59.92 So I guess I do this. I make a peanut butter jelly sandwich. And a milkshake. Yeah. And I put some
01:38:59.92 --> 01:39:06.000 of the peanut butter in the mold. Okay. And that's the chocolate mint one. Yeah. Okay. And that's a weird thing.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.04 It is. Well, it still tastes good. It tastes really good. Wait, wait, what's weird? Peanut butter
01:39:11.04 --> 01:39:18.000 jelly sandwich? Peanut butter and mint. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Together. No, see. And you think yeah,
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.80 sure that is kind of odd. It's not odd. Okay. Well, you want to have to do that for much longer. Yeah.
01:39:22.80 --> 01:39:27.92 Because we got peanut butter milk all the time. So you can just be cool. Just chill with all that
01:39:27.92 --> 01:39:32.32 peanut butter in the mint. And to me, it's all good. Put it all all in there.
01:39:32.32 --> 01:39:36.72 B&J is coming out. She's strong. You're just getting all up on the peanut butter jelly sandwich. It's
01:39:36.72 --> 01:39:41.04 like you're like your nine years old. I know very remember old school. That's the way to get late.
01:39:41.04 --> 01:39:45.60 I don't remember that. I just remember. Oh, what's for breakfast? What PBJ? What's for lunch?
01:39:45.60 --> 01:39:50.24 PB&J. Yeah. Oh, we're going. Remember the little plastic zip lock bag. Actually, we need
01:39:50.24 --> 01:39:56.16 a zip lock bag back back in the day. They just had like a fold over flap. The B.J. smeared all over
01:39:56.16 --> 01:40:01.20 that thing. Mom never put enough jelly on the peanut butter in jelly sandwich. No, never. It was all
01:40:01.20 --> 01:40:05.36 all all. The B.J. want your peanut butter in there. Why is it cheaper that cost the same thing?
01:40:06.08 --> 01:40:12.16 Put more jelly on the sandwich, mom. Come on. Where you at? Get that sweet. Just go ahead. What makes
01:40:12.16 --> 01:40:16.32 that funny is that that is 100%. It's universal. Yeah, they get the universe. I don't know what's
01:40:16.32 --> 01:40:21.44 up with the moms get taught at mom school. Lay off. They go. Hey, hold it back on the jelly. No,
01:40:21.44 --> 01:40:24.88 you know what it was. No, think about it. When you buy, I mean, I don't know how much peanut butter
01:40:24.88 --> 01:40:30.40 you buy at the store and jelly, but I'll let you know. I mean, the jelly things are a little
01:40:30.40 --> 01:40:34.56 much smaller. They're smaller and you live a bit more expensive. Yeah. Yeah. And then peanut butter
01:40:34.56 --> 01:40:37.84 thing is huge. Well, potentially. I mean, you know, you got the kids to the server.
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.80 Crunchy creamy whatever. But you get the peanut the huge peanut butter. You got the little jelly
01:40:44.80 --> 01:40:49.04 with jelly's more expensive. Mom's trying to, you know, you're trying to be kind of a bit
01:40:49.04 --> 01:40:55.04 of a little bit more expensive. But the whole deal. So that home depot. So that home economics class. Do you have home economics and
01:40:55.04 --> 01:41:02.000 high school? Yeah. Yeah. I'm holding economics in high school too. Yeah, yeah. It's good. My, my, I think my little sister got kicked out
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:09.76 of home economics. Oh, yeah. That was funny. Yeah. I could see that. Yeah. You didn't get kicked up.
01:41:10.80 --> 01:41:15.92 I definitely got in trouble a couple of times in home economics, but I, but I didn't get kicked out.
01:41:15.92 --> 01:41:20.24 But my little sister got kicked out for what putting the butter knife in the toaster for something
01:41:20.24 --> 01:41:25.04 to get what she did. I'll, I'll research that and get back with you. She was a, she's a character.
01:41:25.60 --> 01:41:31.12 So, you know, get that home economics was a little tough on her. She's a character for some reason.
01:41:31.12 --> 01:41:36.40 That doesn't surprise me. I don't know her. But, you know, I know other members of your family.
01:41:36.40 --> 01:41:42.88 Check. Mook. Yeah. You back to Mook. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So Mook protein added protein. Here's
01:41:42.88 --> 01:41:47.28 it. Okay. So back to my point. My point was I don't do all the research. You know, so I start just
01:41:47.28 --> 01:41:52.16 pounding Mook, get on the Mook train hard core and meanwhile, I'm discovering all these new things.
01:41:53.36 --> 01:42:00.96 I knew about the probiotics. But now it's like, I find out it's keto friendly. It's, I mean,
01:42:00.96 --> 01:42:05.44 unless you mix it with milk because I mix it with milk. I should make that clear. I mix it with milk.
01:42:05.44 --> 01:42:10.16 Yeah. Yeah. But you go like what, like what's, you go like I said, if you mix it with
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:14.96 out milk, if you mix it with water, then you're talking ham sandwich level of goodness. Yeah. But there's
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:19.76 like, it's like, it's good. Like, it's good. Like, you're like, you can get some coconut. Yeah. That's true.
01:42:19.76 --> 01:42:24.32 That's true. I haven't tried it, actually. I will try it. And here's the thing, too. And this,
01:42:24.80 --> 01:42:30.64 if you, jaco don't know that much about this part, it won't surprise me. There are so many milk,
01:42:30.64 --> 01:42:37.60 like, super-intestants. Yeah. And there are so many, oh, and like lactose-free. Oh, okay. There's like,
01:42:37.60 --> 01:42:41.76 a lot, yeah, there's a lot of options for that. And when you're talking keto, that's a whole,
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:48.24 you know, that's a, that's a whole, like, dietary plan. Yeah. You know, so there are a lot of options.
01:42:48.24 --> 01:42:52.000 So, nonetheless, regardless of what you mix it with. Have you mixed it with that other kind of
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.12 milk milk? Yeah, that, that, that, that almond milk almond milk. almond milk is not keto friendly.
01:42:57.12 --> 01:43:02.000 Is it? I don't think I'm, well, I'm not, you gotta go coconut milk. You can go coconut milk.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.24 Yeah. And you could get there. Yeah. And actually, you gotta get the real coconut milk. You can get the
01:43:06.24 --> 01:43:11.92 fake coconut. You can't get the, the, the, the, the milk that's the coconut milk that they're trying to sell
01:43:11.92 --> 01:43:16.56 you as like a health thing. Well, not, yeah, not, and keep it in my, they're dumb enough. They're
01:43:16.56 --> 01:43:20.88 dumb enough much sugar in this side. Well, wait, are you talking about coconut water? Because there's
01:43:20.88 --> 01:43:25.04 a different, coconut water, no, I'm talking about coconut milk. And I know the difference. Okay.
01:43:25.76 --> 01:43:31.04 When, bro, in Hawaii, we learn all about that in school, but a difference, we know coconut milk
01:43:31.04 --> 01:43:36.16 and coconut water. Yeah. Well, there you go. None, you were right though. You were right about the
01:43:36.16 --> 01:43:42.40 coconut milk. If you get the, you know, the unsweetened milk, the one, the real kind. Yeah, yeah,
01:43:42.40 --> 01:43:47.28 the real kind. Straight coconut milk. And that's keto you're saying. Yes. Okay. So that's the one I
01:43:47.28 --> 01:43:55.76 mixed it with. It's kind of like 10 billion grams of fat. It's so good. It's like 98 grams of fat in a
01:43:55.76 --> 01:44:03.44 can of coconut milk. Oh, good. But it's for his keto goes, that's dope. Good. But we're talking
01:44:03.44 --> 01:44:08.24 about the milk itself though. The milk is the powder. Yeah. So that's keto. So whatever you mix
01:44:08.24 --> 01:44:12.32 it with, that's going to be, you know, an extreme ownership situation. You know, if you want to
01:44:12.32 --> 01:44:16.96 stick with the keto, stick with the keto. Mocha is part of that, that deal. You can't sit there.
01:44:16.96 --> 01:44:23.04 And then the last good, good, clean protein probiotics, all these things, and it tastes good. And
01:44:23.04 --> 01:44:27.44 here's the thing. It's not like, oh, yeah, all these benefits. And then by the way, tastes good. It's not that
01:44:27.44 --> 01:44:33.12 to me. It tastes good. So and by the way, it has all this good. So you're now with me on the thing about
01:44:33.12 --> 01:44:38.96 the importance of things tasting good, or I should say the importance of things tasting good.
01:44:40.16 --> 01:44:46.32 You're with me that that is that is probably possibly the most important thing. If you're
01:44:46.32 --> 01:44:50.56 going to bring something into your game like fully, yeah, if this is going to be come part of your
01:44:50.56 --> 01:44:54.64 life, if it doesn't taste good, it's not going to come part of your life. And if you bring
01:44:54.64 --> 01:44:59.84 something, it's part of your life that tastes like crap, like how long you're going to sustain
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:04.56 that for. And why when you can have something that delicious? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't,
01:45:04.56 --> 01:45:10.32 you don't have to have that beef anymore. No, for this kind of stuff. But yeah, and that's the
01:45:10.32 --> 01:45:14.32 whole reason I like it, like I said, you know, Barry Jelly sandwich with the moch, right, and
01:45:14.32 --> 01:45:18.96 I put a little bit of peanut butter in it, like I said, and I'm like, it is literally like a
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:24.24 dessert. I'm like pounding it on that thing. Yeah. It's really good. No, last year,
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:28.96 very good. OriginMain.com. That's where you get these outstanding things. Also,
01:45:28.96 --> 01:45:33.92 jujitsu immersion camp back to jujitsu and origin in and of itself in a lot of

01:45:40.32 --> 01:45:46.72 off. I know best way to learn jujitsu most of the day. I'm sure there are exceptions, but if you
01:45:46.72 --> 01:45:53.52 immerse yourself in any activity, that's a very, very effective and good way to learn. And
01:45:54.88 --> 01:46:00.24 there's an ejujitsu immersion camp. Yeah. August 26th through September 2nd this year.

01:46:12.72 --> 01:46:18.64 Okay. So it's not sold out. I don't. It might be close, but go inside up now. Yeah. And there we
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:22.24 can go. And then yeah, well, that's the best way to find out if it's sold out. Go sign up.

01:48:46.16 --> 01:48:54.48 Uh, because you know, I'm not super fashion aware. Yes. Our tank tops out in or out of style.
01:48:55.68 --> 01:48:58.56 Because tank tops are the reason I style. The reason I style. As this is because
01:48:58.88 --> 01:49:02.96 first of all, I wear the same clothes forever. Yes. And I wear them until I completely destroyed.
01:49:02.96 --> 01:49:08.72 Well, I had when I met my wife, I had a bunch of tank tops. That was sort of like my go to
01:49:08.72 --> 01:49:12.88 just warm all the time because it's hot, right? Well, I don't wear them all time, but any time the
01:49:12.88 --> 01:49:17.12 temperature, anytime in the summertime, anytime. Love what that's cool. One more time. Functional.
01:49:17.12 --> 01:49:23.92 And then one day, my wife, because they were all old and ratti and they had Guinness stains on them.
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:28.80 And they were just all jacks. But I didn't care. Of course. Because whatever. And my wife
01:49:29.52 --> 01:49:38.72 threw every single one of them away. Yeah. Every single one of them. Like just, and the thing is
01:49:38.72 --> 01:49:44.64 in her mind, it wasn't spiteful. She was actually super stoked. Like, oh yeah, I know. Oh yeah,
01:49:44.64 --> 01:49:50.16 you know how those old, I'll get your t-shirt. I threw my way. So you have to set up the shirts now.
01:49:50.16 --> 01:49:55.28 You're welcome. You know, she's coming at me with you. Welcome. And meanwhile, these were all
01:49:55.28 --> 01:49:59.44 like my favorite. They were all super. You know, I shirt that's like 14 years old. The super comfy.
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:05.68 Yeah, I know the air. You're the comfort. The comfort kind of story. Come on. A t shirt that's 20 years
01:50:05.68 --> 01:50:10.72 old is more comfortable than a t-shirt that's brand new. Correct? Yes. Okay. So I had a whole series of
01:50:10.72 --> 01:50:15.84 tank tops like that all super comfortable. My wife threw them all the way. I've been complaining.
01:50:16.40 --> 01:50:22.000 The one thing is my wife complains about me is that when something happens, like this,
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.96 I hold it against her forever. Yeah. I still will bring it up. Like, you know, it's been hot lately.
01:50:26.96 --> 01:50:30.88 Yes. You know, they're there. I'm like, oh, she's like, I can't believe how hot it is. I mean,
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:34.64 like, I've been nice fed some tank tops. But it's all right. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the cool.
01:50:36.24 --> 01:50:40.56 So okay. Tank tops. Yeah. I need to go. What are you going? Back in the game with the tank
01:50:40.56 --> 01:50:45.84 tops. Come at you. To answer your question, our tank tops. What do you say in fashion? Yeah, because
01:50:45.84 --> 01:50:51.20 when I think tank tops, I also think like 80s dude, right? Which is pretty much what I was.
01:50:53.04 --> 01:50:57.36 And probably still am. But you're just throwing like a question out there to make sure I'm not
01:50:57.36 --> 01:51:03.44 out of line with it. Yeah. You know what though? I think tank tops. Like, remember the pants that
01:51:03.44 --> 01:51:07.04 I figured they were called, but like the bodybuilders were those pants that were kind of like an elastic.
01:51:07.04 --> 01:51:14.88 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, I don't want, if that's the equivalent right now,
01:51:14.88 --> 01:51:22.72 maybe I don't know if you're all out like that. I mean, if those pants were like, Funk, but they
01:51:22.72 --> 01:51:27.28 were super not functional. Yeah. I don't, I mean, functional for what? What, I want to know what
01:51:27.28 --> 01:51:33.20 those pants were called. What do you think they were actually called? I think that a name. Yeah. I think so.
01:51:33.20 --> 01:51:37.36 I don't know what they're called. I know, and this is a different type of pants, but you remember
01:51:37.36 --> 01:51:43.12 the MC Hammer pants? Yeah. Those are slightly different similar. Yeah. The bodybuilding ones
01:51:43.12 --> 01:51:46.08 with the print on them. Yeah. They're kind of like, they're kind of like, they're kind of like,
01:51:46.08 --> 01:51:49.92 the aluminum. Yeah. Balloony, but tight at the ankles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're keeping
01:51:49.92 --> 01:51:53.84 her. I actually never had a pair of those. Thank God. I could see that. Yeah. That's a kind of thing.
01:51:53.84 --> 01:51:58.000 Or it's like a picture that surfaces on the internet. You're like, damn. Yeah. That's old school.
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.16 Yeah. It's retro. Actually, you know, they bring it down. Maybe it's coming back. Maybe.
01:52:02.16 --> 01:52:05.20 I don't know. Maybe. All right. Or maybe. All right. Or maybe.
01:52:05.20 --> 01:52:08.16 No, no, no. Tinctops of the they're in. Okay. They'll never cool out because he
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:13.76 ends up this too. They're not functional. They're like cooler. They're not as hot. Yes.
01:52:13.76 --> 01:52:18.16 So we're down with them. They agree. So boom. We got that. Get on if you want to represent

01:53:47.36 --> 01:53:54.48 and he makes not only the videos of this podcast, but he also makes enhanced ones with lots of
01:53:54.48 --> 01:54:00.72 graphics. You need to let him know. Sometimes maybe he's brushing up against going too crazy. Right?
01:54:00.72 --> 01:54:06.72 Yes. It's we've been talking about it. Yeah. If too many things explode, I mean, let's face it.
01:54:06.72 --> 01:54:13.68 There's a lot of movies out there. What are those movies? What's the most, the best one?
01:54:13.68 --> 01:54:18.96 Commando. Okay. So there. Commando has just, no, you gotta go with a more modern one. There's
01:54:18.96 --> 01:54:24.000 more CGI and just everything's blown up. Oh. Dang. I watched one on the other day with my nine
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.32 year old daughter. Everything blew up. Everything was on fire. Everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:54:28.32 --> 01:54:30.16 Yeah. Yeah. We started to seem like it was one of your videos.
01:54:30.16 --> 01:54:39.52 All right. There you go. There you go. You got that new tool. The only video that's I think is
01:54:39.52 --> 01:54:44.48 truly brushed up against it. You've made. I don't think you're cross-aligned, but the war path video.
01:54:44.48 --> 01:54:49.84 You were brushing up against everything that I did exploded and turned to dust and caught
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:54.56 on fire. You were on the war path. You were on the war path in the video. It was thematic.
01:54:54.56 --> 01:55:00.96 Yeah. And it happened to be Christmas time at the time for the original. No red still on there.
01:55:00.96 --> 01:55:05.20 So there's that nonetheless. Yeah. You can go to the wrong YouTube. Yes. videos.
01:55:05.20 --> 01:55:09.68 Also, when we're working out, just got rings. I told you that. Yeah. They just came in.
01:55:09.68 --> 01:55:12.80 Boom. Really nice ones too. You can't do muscle ups though, because you're on.
01:55:12.80 --> 01:55:18.24 Not right now. No. But here's the thing, but I never cut into muscle ups. That's wrong. So I've
01:55:18.24 --> 01:55:23.44 attempted muscle ups and I've seen that there's a technique to muscle ups. Like you've seen it.
01:55:23.44 --> 01:55:33.92 Yes. Yeah. So I've never had the pleasure of doing a muscle up. Ever. Never done a muscle up.
01:55:33.92 --> 01:55:40.80 Rings bar nothing. So my arm heals. Fully. You're going to keep a muscle up. I'm doing
01:55:40.80 --> 01:55:46.000 muscle up. That's my whole thing. I'm going to be one of my things. Also, a pistol squat.
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.64 Okay. So I've done pistol squats before. Really hard. Really clunky, really ugly, even.
01:55:50.64 --> 01:55:55.92 But the next call you out on that one day. In. Like while we were doing the podcast,
01:55:55.92 --> 01:56:00.24 I like after the podcast, I was like, oh, pistol. Yeah. And then I was like, well, let's get.
01:56:00.24 --> 01:56:04.88 Yeah. You're not as flexible. Are you? No, no, no. I am. Remember, you were like,
01:56:04.88 --> 01:56:24.40 I am very flexible. Oh, okay. In my knees in my ankle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We really got a lot of room to move around.
01:56:24.40 --> 01:56:31.20 Oh, I did. Yeah. I said, please. Yeah. They got rough. Yeah. Yeah. Just so. So side splittingly fun.
01:56:31.20 --> 01:56:35.92 Anyway, very flexible. I'm going to do pistol squats and muscle ups. Watch.
01:56:35.92 --> 01:56:41.44 And be really good at it. Nonetheless, my point is, I got my rings. Anyway, my actually
01:56:41.44 --> 01:56:46.32 mid point is we're talking about on it. So you go to on it.com slash chocolate. This is where
01:56:46.32 --> 01:56:54.24 I have been getting outstanding workout gear that deviates from my normal dumbbells. You know,
01:56:54.96 --> 01:56:59.52 whatever. So I got turned on the kettlebells. All this good stuff. They have some good stuff.
01:56:59.52 --> 01:57:04.16 The bag. You know, like the, I don't think it's a bulk Gary in bag. You know, a bulk
01:57:04.16 --> 01:57:09.76 Gary in bag. I have the big same bag thing from on it. Okay. So how big is your sand bag?
01:57:09.76 --> 01:57:15.04 Bigger than yours. Well, I don't have one. Oh, okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, there's just one size. I
01:57:15.04 --> 01:57:22.000 think from on it. Okay. Yeah. But then you can you fill it up. Yeah, right? But did like how much
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.72 this is for sure. I have no idea. No, no, go away. Tell me. Okay. Just so I can fill up.
01:57:26.72 --> 01:57:32.48 Put an extra pound in there. Cool. But I've been doing that. The farmer's carry. Yeah.
01:57:32.48 --> 01:57:38.24 I mean, my arm can't sustain too much weight. But it's solid. Yeah. It's a solid. I go around.
01:57:38.24 --> 01:57:42.64 I, if I went around the block through the day with my 106s, two of them. Yeah.
01:57:42.64 --> 01:57:46.08 One, it won't want any chance. Yeah. And like, I just like, okay, you know, it's definitely
01:57:46.08 --> 01:57:52.24 challenging. It takes it. And I have to set them down a couple times during that lap. But what I noticed
01:57:52.24 --> 01:58:00.16 was the next day, like my entire, my entire like traps, net shoulders, everything and for us. We're all
01:58:00.16 --> 01:58:06.48 sore. Yeah. So I mean, I had that in the routine. I was doing it pretty regular. I like to see how far
01:58:06.48 --> 01:58:12.48 I can get. Yeah. He's done my anyways. It's really good. Just for your body. Yeah. Like strength. How far
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:21.36 is your block? I don't know. More than, well, block is about what you can't do. Yeah. Because it blocks
01:58:21.36 --> 01:58:25.76 from the same side. Yeah. I think he like city block downtown. Turned Eagles. Yeah. It's different.
01:58:25.76 --> 01:58:29.92 Wait a minute. Nonetheless, anyway, on a dot com slash juckled, really cool stuff on their
01:58:29.92 --> 01:58:34.64 cool info as well. Don't, you can get stuck on that website because it's a lot of cool stuff on
01:58:34.64 --> 01:58:39.52 there. Also psychological warfare. It's an album with tracks. A lot of people ask for a
01:58:39.52 --> 01:58:43.28 alarm system. This is kind of an alarm that you can put in your phone and it's me talking
01:58:43.28 --> 01:58:49.84 about times that you might want to slack off. This will not allow any slack psychological warfare.
01:58:49.84 --> 01:58:55.52 It's on iTunes, Google Play, etc. Jack. It's a good one. Dang. It was pretty concise. Yeah. And
01:58:55.52 --> 01:59:05.28 effective because that is what it is. Also, juckled like tea. Yeah. I got, so the tea, I'm into the
01:59:05.28 --> 01:59:09.68 cans, not into the brewing. Jay Peas. Sorry, bro. Jay Peas. I think JP might have a problem.
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:16.88 JP's all about it. Actually, okay. So let me ask you this. It has a little bit of caffeine. And what's good
01:59:16.88 --> 01:59:27.76 is that JP, JP, my brother, that boy can drink some dang energy drinks like crazy. Like, like,
01:59:27.76 --> 01:59:33.28 where I should have as a friend been like a JP. I think he talked to you. Like, he said, he
01:59:33.28 --> 01:59:37.36 re-have. We need to get you off these things. Because he would pound that stuff. You know, because
01:59:37.36 --> 01:59:43.04 he's going hard. He's, you know, JP's getting after it. And so it's like, okay, cool. I'll just
01:59:43.04 --> 01:59:50.16 drink, drink energy drinks. And also now he's on, he's drinking a chocolate tea. And so that's
01:59:50.16 --> 01:59:55.84 real positive. It's a good replacement for that crap. He's just pounding. Yeah. Yeah. I,
01:59:55.84 --> 02:00:01.44 but he still owe me like a crackhead. Like, hey, man, it's a thing. Yeah, I just got another two
02:00:01.44 --> 02:00:06.96 cases. By the way, cans. Can you give it to little kid like, being not babies? There's caffeine in it,
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:10.80 bro. That, yeah. That's what I give it to little kids. Yeah, because my son grabs,
02:00:10.80 --> 02:00:17.68 and grabs. What's it done with? He does lift the, oh, he's doing it. He's a little kid.
02:00:17.68 --> 02:00:22.96 Nonetheless, yes, very good. Ooh, another thing that happens to taste really, really good from
02:00:22.96 --> 02:00:26.64 Jockel, Jockel's into the little tasting good thing. Nonetheless, Jockel, why do you really go to
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:32.24 organic certified? Yeah. By the way, so get down with it. Yeah. It's good to wait. You know,
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:38.32 right now it's on Amazon. And we're going to expand that. We got it in Canada. So on Jockel's
02:00:38.32 --> 02:00:43.12 store too, by the way. I want to say Australia. Get some Jocquatino Australia. We're going to go England.
02:00:43.12 --> 02:00:50.08 So anyways, well, the store ships everywhere look like are the shipping from the store. He's people. I
02:00:50.08 --> 02:00:55.92 hate when people say like, hey, man, what's up with your shipping? Yeah, I know. I don't, I'd rather
02:00:55.92 --> 02:01:02.16 you just don't buy it. You know, you're buying whatever wait till we get it to your country.
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:06.80 Yeah. Well, we haven't in your country. We got in Canada. We got it in England. We got on Australia.
02:01:06.80 --> 02:01:11.68 Yeah. Jocquatino. Well, here's the thing in the channel. Shipping from the store can get
02:01:11.68 --> 02:01:15.36 challenge it because we're paying what they're kind of charging us for though. It's like a whole
02:01:15.36 --> 02:01:21.20 thing. Then we're working on just slowly and slowly. Yeah. Shipping more. You know, plus the
02:01:21.20 --> 02:01:28.48 the the the bigger we get. Yes. Then we get the economy of scales. Yes. And so that's it makes
02:01:28.48 --> 02:01:33.36 stuff. She's so appreciate that. Some more on our way. Because one day you're going to be able to buy
02:01:33.36 --> 02:01:38.88 Jocquatino everywhere you go. You might just be coming out of your drinking fountain too.
02:01:38.88 --> 02:01:45.84 It's like, oh, yeah. I'm going to. Yeah. I'm going to get a stronger thing. Yeah. I wrote some books.
02:01:46.96 --> 02:01:52.56 One of them is called the way the warrior kid. One of them is a follow up of that book series called
02:01:52.56 --> 02:01:58.32 Way the Warrior Kid Marks Mission. Those books will help your kid. I promise. How's that?
02:01:58.32 --> 02:02:05.84 Yeah. Should I do that? I think I think you can do that. Yes. I've got I've not had anyone say,
02:02:05.84 --> 02:02:11.04 hey, my kid read that book and didn't like it and has now said that they want to get weaker.
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:15.92 Yeah. That's not happening. Hey, this does not help. Yeah. So, way the warrior kid books
02:02:16.56 --> 02:02:22.48 get them for whoever. Whatever kid you know, whatever family get them for your library, get them for whoever.
02:02:22.48 --> 02:02:29.12 It's like it's like a good way to help man. It's a good way to help. Also got a book called
02:02:29.12 --> 02:02:32.88 Desperning Coast Freedom Field Management. I just said someone has wrote on Twitter that that's the
02:02:32.88 --> 02:02:39.12 best book they've ever read. No, no frame of reference might be the only book he's ever read.
02:02:39.12 --> 02:02:46.24 But unless I will say this, the field manual, if you crack that thing open,
02:02:46.24 --> 02:02:52.96 then you take a little look. It'll reset. Your, your, your, your compass a little bit. Really will.
02:02:52.96 --> 02:02:57.76 It resets my, I wrote the book and I still get my compass reset when I look at it. So it's a good book
02:02:57.76 --> 02:03:03.68 to get for people that are sort of like maybe they're a little bit. They're, they're somewhere, right?
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:08.24 They're not really going in the right direction. Oh, they're not going in the right direction.
02:03:08.24 --> 02:03:12.72 As horn as they should be. Boom. Yeah. It doesn't matter. You're someone that's like completely
02:03:12.72 --> 02:03:18.88 off the path like on the slippery slope. You're in the, in the, was that place you called one time like
02:03:18.88 --> 02:03:26.16 the, the weed? Yeah. No, no, yeah. We do, you do someone from a movie that you saw, which is a lot
02:03:26.16 --> 02:03:33.04 of movies. Some place of misery swamps the sadness during the swamp. Maybe someone's something
02:03:33.04 --> 02:03:36.16 sort of getting in the book. But you get someone that's like not in the swamp, but that's actually
02:03:36.16 --> 02:03:39.68 on the path they want to get further on the path getting that book right there. I really like how you
02:03:39.68 --> 02:03:44.40 swamps the sadness. Yeah. That makes me feel very good. He's a references via you. So that's
02:03:44.40 --> 02:03:50.48 discipline. It goes freedom. The field manual. It's not a normal book. No, it's not a normal book.
02:03:52.08 --> 02:03:55.28 Extreme ownership. That's the first book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
02:03:56.08 --> 02:04:00.80 And that book is about leadership. It's about the combat leadership principles we learned
02:04:00.80 --> 02:04:05.04 on the battlefield and how you can apply them to everything that you do. Now we got a follow-up book
02:04:05.04 --> 02:04:10.80 to that called the dichotomy leadership. The follow-up book to that is actually chapter 12 of
02:04:10.80 --> 02:04:15.92 extreme ownership talks about the dichotomy leadership. And that's balancing these opposing forces
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:22.56 and we realized through echelon front our consulting company that the biggest problem people have
02:04:22.56 --> 02:04:27.84 is that they have a hard time staying balanced as a leader. So we wrote a whole book about it
02:04:27.84 --> 02:04:32.72 so that people can dial in and get granular and that's the dichotomy leadership.
02:04:32.72 --> 02:04:39.28 We're getting awesome feedback on it. We're better writers now than we are then. I mean,
02:04:39.28 --> 02:04:46.80 here's the three years. I've been reading and writing of non-stop and so we're better.
02:04:47.60 --> 02:04:54.40 And so yeah, that's that. That comes out September 25th. If you want the first edition,
02:04:55.60 --> 02:05:02.48 you got to order it now. Someone said that they're ordering it now so that they get the first
02:05:02.48 --> 02:05:08.72 edition so that when they meet me and I sign it, they're not like holding their head down and saying
02:05:08.72 --> 02:05:14.80 someone else said, hey, oh, I guess I'm a bad guy because I gave away my first edition of
02:05:14.80 --> 02:05:20.88 extreme ownership. You're not a bad guy. You just made a mistake. Get somebody else. The third edition,
02:05:20.88 --> 02:05:24.56 the fifth edition. You don't care about that. You only want a desk. You only get one crack at the
02:05:24.56 --> 02:05:29.76 title or they're very, very noble. You know, we copies of the extreme of about face I have.
02:05:29.76 --> 02:05:34.72 I'm going to count them. I don't know, but I got a lot. Okay. Always in the hunt for that first edition.
02:05:34.72 --> 02:05:43.84 Got a couple of them. Got you. Got you. So anyways, that's that. Also, I just mentioned
02:05:43.84 --> 02:05:48.32 echelon front. That is our leadership and management consulting company. It's me,
02:05:48.32 --> 02:05:53.92 Lave Babin, JP Nell, Dave Burke, Flynn Cockrant and also Mike Surrely, who is just on the podcast
02:05:53.92 --> 02:06:01.28 134 awesome podcast, awesome to talk to Mike, awesome to be working with Mike again. And what we do is
02:06:01.28 --> 02:06:07.68 we solve problems through leadership period. That's what we do. Mustard 006 in San Francisco,
02:06:07.68 --> 02:06:14.56 California, October 17th and 18th. It's going to sell out. I would get in close, but
02:06:16.96 --> 02:06:21.92 yeah, register an extreme ownership.com. Every mustard we've done has sold out this in the 6 one.
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:28.000 Also, this is an important one for current military law enforcement, border patrol,
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.44 firefighters, Paramax, everyone. All you first responders out there. We've got a one day
02:06:33.44 --> 02:06:42.08 leadership seminar in Texas Dallas, Texas September 21st. We did this because we wanted to do something
02:06:42.08 --> 02:06:47.28 shorter and focused so that more people in uniform could get to it. And it's a cheaper price
02:06:47.28 --> 02:06:53.04 point than the master. So if you're in one of those types of organizations, come to the roll call.
02:06:53.04 --> 02:06:58.48 And it's, but it is a master. It's a mini-muster. Would you say that? It's not really a mini-muster.
02:06:58.48 --> 02:07:02.88 It's a, it's, they're both leadership training, right? But this one is completely focused on
02:07:02.88 --> 02:07:08.000 these dynamic environments, whereas the master's talking about talks about a broader leadership,
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.20 a little bit broader, not so focused. I shouldn't say not so focused. This one is specific. It's
02:07:13.20 --> 02:07:18.48 true. The dynamic environments. Yeah. And we can focus a little bit more on it. The challenges
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:24.16 are, we can address the challenges that those leaders have in those dynamic environments. As
02:07:24.16 --> 02:07:28.40 opposed to the master where we address, that one is definitely the master is more focused on
02:07:28.40 --> 02:07:32.16 business leadership. Even though we get all types of leaders and we do get military law enforcement
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:37.92 there, it's focused on business leadership more. This one is you focus. And like, and I just got
02:07:37.92 --> 02:07:44.000 back, I mean, it's worked with the Arizona Highway Patrol and just being out there. You know,
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.88 you just, you hear that it's leadership. And the better you are as a leader, the better your
02:07:48.88 --> 02:07:53.12 team's going to be, the more prepared you're going to be for bad situations. And we, you know,
02:07:53.12 --> 02:07:56.48 echelon front does this. We work with fire departments. We work with police departments.
02:07:57.12 --> 02:08:02.32 And we know that not every department can bring us in. So that's why we do this. That's why
02:08:02.32 --> 02:08:07.52 we decided to do this roll call. So people could come to it and get the training concentrated
02:08:07.52 --> 02:08:13.28 one day. So they're better prepared to do their jobs on the beat, on the battlefield, wherever they
02:08:13.28 --> 02:08:21.84 are. All right. And lastly, we have the Overwatch EF Overwatch, which is where we are connecting
02:08:23.04 --> 02:08:31.20 special operations that's combat aviation that's with companies that need solid leaders. You can
02:08:31.20 --> 02:08:39.60 go to EF Overwatch.com to get in the game on that. And if you want to spend some time with us virtually,
02:08:41.28 --> 02:08:46.000 virtually in the virtual world until we see each other live at the master in San Francisco,
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.48 where we see each other live at the roll call in Texas or live at the immersion camp in Maine,
02:08:51.12 --> 02:08:57.76 then you can find us on the in-rewebs on Twitter, on Instagram. And of course on that defaes.
02:08:57.76 --> 02:09:06.000 Oh, I was at Eko Charles and I am at Jocco Willink and as always to those of you out there in
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:11.12 uniform that are protecting us here in a broad that's a military law enforcement firefighter
02:09:11.12 --> 02:09:17.76 sport of patrol paramedics, other first responders without you, the world falls apart. So thank you
02:09:17.76 --> 02:09:22.88 for what you do and thanks to everyone for listening. Thanks to everyone for supporting. I know that
02:09:22.88 --> 02:09:31.68 this podcast is not always the most uplifting thing to listen to. I know it gets heavy. I know it
02:09:31.68 --> 02:09:39.04 gets dark just like life does, but I definitely don't want you to dwell in the darkness. I don't
02:09:39.04 --> 02:09:48.08 dwell there, but as I've said before, I do think that we need to know the darkness so that we can
02:09:48.08 --> 02:09:55.60 steer our lives in the right direction away from it, toward the good and toward the light.
02:09:58.16 --> 02:10:08.000 So go out there. Don't be judgmental, go out there and fight against the darkness by doing
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:16.72 what you should be doing, what you know you should be doing by doing good by being good and of course,
02:10:16.72 --> 02:10:41.04 by getting after it. Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
