00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.28
This is Jockel Podcast number 51 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:09.28 --> 00:00:11.28
Good evening.

4
00:00:11.28 --> 00:00:15.28
Forgotten.

5
00:00:15.28 --> 00:00:23.32
The Korean War is often referred to as the forgotten war.

6
00:00:23.32 --> 00:00:33.76
It's sandwiched between the massive World War II and then on the other side the highly

7
00:00:33.76 --> 00:00:41.44
controversial and also highly televised and therefore highly remembered Vietnam war.

8
00:00:41.44 --> 00:00:51.08
So I guess in that middle of that the Korean War somehow gets lost and I guess somehow

9
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:53.92
it gets forgotten.

10
00:00:53.92 --> 00:00:58.32
Obviously we should never forget.

11
00:00:58.32 --> 00:01:06.92
The war in Korea was brutal and in many ways when you look at the Korean War you see

12
00:01:06.92 --> 00:01:10.92
the worst parts of these other wars.

13
00:01:10.92 --> 00:01:14.72
You had the trenches of World War I.

14
00:01:14.72 --> 00:01:19.84
You had the bitter cold of the eastern front in World War II.

15
00:01:19.84 --> 00:01:26.16
You have the land mines of the Vietnam War.

16
00:01:26.16 --> 00:01:37.64
And for the nearly 2 million that served in Korea and the more than 100,000 that were wounded

17
00:01:37.64 --> 00:01:46.68
we should never forget and we must never forget and for the 36,516 Americans that

18
00:01:46.68 --> 00:01:54.40
were killed we must always remember.

19
00:01:54.40 --> 00:01:55.40
Always.

20
00:01:55.40 --> 00:02:03.88
And remember that for those that died there is nothing else.

21
00:02:03.88 --> 00:02:05.000
There's nothing else.

22
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.24
They gave everything.

23
00:02:09.24 --> 00:02:16.76
They gave for a few meters in between trenches or for a hill or for their brothers and

24
00:02:16.76 --> 00:02:17.76
arms.

25
00:02:17.76 --> 00:02:21.92
That's what war does.

26
00:02:21.92 --> 00:02:33.40
It gives everything to some and it takes everything from others.

27
00:02:33.40 --> 00:02:41.20
But tonight we begin to take a look at the Korean War through the eyes of James Brady.

28
00:02:41.20 --> 00:02:55.08
United States Marine Corps in his book The Coldest War.

29
00:02:55.08 --> 00:02:58.36
What job are you looking for?

30
00:02:58.36 --> 00:03:01.16
I knew the expected answer and snapped it back.

31
00:03:01.16 --> 00:03:04.56
Life will pull two and leaders sir.

32
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:09.44
The major said that I was a hard charger that they needed hard chargers in the basic

33
00:03:09.44 --> 00:03:12.04
school in Virginia where they train Marine Lieutenant.

34
00:03:12.04 --> 00:03:15.56
They ask you every few hours that same question.

35
00:03:15.56 --> 00:03:20.96
Then they push a format you to write down your first three choices of duty.

36
00:03:20.96 --> 00:03:23.48
There are several schools of thought about this.

37
00:03:23.48 --> 00:03:25.80
One hell you should tell the truth.

38
00:03:25.80 --> 00:03:31.68
Those who subscribe to this odd notion put down communications or tanks or mountain training,

39
00:03:31.68 --> 00:03:36.76
anything that might delay assignment to a replacement draft and the war.

40
00:03:36.76 --> 00:03:38.36
Another advised diplomacy.

41
00:03:38.36 --> 00:03:42.52
A first choice of rifle platoon leader to show your spirit.

42
00:03:42.52 --> 00:03:44.84
Then what you really hope for.

43
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:47.96
Logistics or motor transport.

44
00:03:47.96 --> 00:03:55.000
A third school felt you should lie brazenly indicating ferocious demand for a rifle platoon

45
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.60
on grounds that this might impress people and get you made a general's aid.

46
00:04:00.60 --> 00:04:05.84
Mac Allen achieved something of a name at basic school by stipulating quite honestly

47
00:04:05.84 --> 00:04:12.24
each time rifle platoon leader rifle platoon leader.

48
00:04:12.24 --> 00:04:14.56
I didn't worry about it much.

49
00:04:14.56 --> 00:04:18.72
Not out of fatalism but simply because I believe the Marine Corps discarded all such

50
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:24.32
forms without reading and it didn't matter much what you wrote.

51
00:04:24.32 --> 00:04:29.36
This close to the line I was too embarrassed to give any answer but the one the major

52
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:31.24
obviously wanted to hear.

53
00:04:31.24 --> 00:04:33.08
Splendid said the major.

54
00:04:33.08 --> 00:04:35.60
We have an opening for a hard charger.

55
00:04:35.60 --> 00:04:38.48
Second battalion Colonel Gregory's battalion.

56
00:04:38.48 --> 00:04:40.20
They want hard chargers up there.

57
00:04:40.20 --> 00:04:42.56
They need them.

58
00:04:42.56 --> 00:04:44.04
That's where you're going.

59
00:04:44.04 --> 00:04:47.92
Second battalion short of company grade officers.

60
00:04:47.92 --> 00:04:51.32
Then sensing curiosity that's what I'm sending both of you.

61
00:04:51.32 --> 00:04:52.88
You and Alan.

62
00:04:52.88 --> 00:04:57.16
Hard chargers.

63
00:04:57.16 --> 00:05:04.04
We're going to hear a little bit about Mac Allen who gives just the most fired up response

64
00:05:04.04 --> 00:05:05.04
you can give.

65
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:07.88
He could ask what job you want the Marine Corps when you're going through the basic

66
00:05:07.88 --> 00:05:14.12
school and that is rifle platoon leader rifle platoon leader or rifle platoon leader.

67
00:05:14.12 --> 00:05:22.84
Prior to that evolution, James Brady is actually graduating from his school.

68
00:05:22.84 --> 00:05:25.68
In 1950, I'll go to the book.

69
00:05:25.68 --> 00:05:30.20
In June 1950, I graduated and was handed along with my BA a commission in the United

70
00:05:30.20 --> 00:05:33.68
States Marine Corps reserve a second lieutenant.

71
00:05:33.68 --> 00:05:34.96
That was clever.

72
00:05:34.96 --> 00:05:41.76
I remember thinking how nimbly I avoided two years of military drugdry.

73
00:05:41.76 --> 00:05:48.40
A week or so later, the North Koreans crossed the 38th parallel and the war was on.

74
00:05:48.40 --> 00:05:52.36
Within a few months my class was mobilized.

75
00:05:52.36 --> 00:05:57.48
I joined up to dodge the draft and ended up being sent to war.

76
00:05:57.48 --> 00:06:04.20
People said the worst job you could have was Marine rifle platoon leader.

77
00:06:04.20 --> 00:06:08.60
Life expectancy was supposed to be very short.

78
00:06:08.60 --> 00:06:11.16
He thinks he's just avoiding the draft.

79
00:06:11.16 --> 00:06:12.40
World War II and ended.

80
00:06:12.40 --> 00:06:13.40
There's nothing going on.

81
00:06:13.40 --> 00:06:17.12
But I don't really feel like doing two years of service.

82
00:06:17.12 --> 00:06:22.76
I'm just going to join the reserve, the Marine Corps reserves, and didn't work out that

83
00:06:22.76 --> 00:06:26.36
way for him.

84
00:06:26.36 --> 00:06:27.36
Now we get to Korea.

85
00:06:27.36 --> 00:06:30.48
I'm just going to skip some of the other leading up to Korea.

86
00:06:30.48 --> 00:06:31.48
They show up at Korea.

87
00:06:31.48 --> 00:06:34.84
One of the reasons that I've got a bunch of books I'm going to read over the years and one

88
00:06:34.84 --> 00:06:39.96
of the reasons that this book kind of bubble to the surface because there's a guy

89
00:06:39.96 --> 00:06:47.08
in it named Captain Chaffey who is going to see just exquisite leadership throughout the

90
00:06:47.08 --> 00:06:50.40
little things he does.

91
00:06:50.40 --> 00:06:56.12
It just is worth studying, worth us taking a look at.

92
00:06:56.12 --> 00:07:00.80
They show up in Korea in this guy, Captain Chaffey.

93
00:07:00.80 --> 00:07:04.44
He kind of greets him.

94
00:07:04.44 --> 00:07:07.96
Back to the book, Captain Chaffey, the dog company commander came a few hundred yards

95
00:07:07.96 --> 00:07:12.60
down the trail to meet the Gook train, shaking hands with Alan and me.

96
00:07:12.60 --> 00:07:17.72
The Gook train, Gook's a terminal again to a little bit later, it's a term that they use

97
00:07:17.72 --> 00:07:24.48
for these Koreans that work for them that did all the marching up and down carrying water

98
00:07:24.48 --> 00:07:26.84
and fuel up and down.

99
00:07:26.84 --> 00:07:28.36
They call it the Gook train.

100
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:34.20
And they also win it's time for new people to get brought up to the front lines.

101
00:07:34.20 --> 00:07:36.76
They follow up the Gook train.

102
00:07:36.76 --> 00:07:38.44
So Captain Chaffey comes down and meet him.

103
00:07:38.44 --> 00:07:39.44
Back to the book.

104
00:07:39.44 --> 00:07:41.80
I'm very pleased to have you both here.

105
00:07:41.80 --> 00:07:45.76
I simply wanted to say welcome and get you off to a proper start.

106
00:07:45.76 --> 00:07:47.40
Chaffey was a road islander.

107
00:07:47.40 --> 00:07:53.44
One of those old Yankee blue bloods with a high color of large nose and a splendid mustache.

108
00:07:53.44 --> 00:07:57.000
He was very lean, very dark, a handsome man.

109
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.36
He didn't seem to have any weapon of any sort.

110
00:08:00.36 --> 00:08:03.80
Only a kind of alpine stave that he used as he loped.

111
00:08:03.80 --> 00:08:07.68
His long legs covering the uneven ground in great strides.

112
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:11.76
Going uphill he was fast and coming down he nearly ran.

113
00:08:11.76 --> 00:08:18.08
Later I would learn he was skull and bones at Yale and had a law practice and political ambitions.

114
00:08:18.08 --> 00:08:21.24
He now took us on a guided tour of the company front.

115
00:08:21.24 --> 00:08:28.40
So not your typical sort of what you'd expect a Marine Corps company commander to be.

116
00:08:28.40 --> 00:08:34.48
You know, guys at Yale he's a lawyer and sounds like he comes from some money.

117
00:08:34.48 --> 00:08:39.20
So kind of different than what you imagine.

118
00:08:39.20 --> 00:08:42.16
Back to the book we're a trifle under strength at the moment.

119
00:08:42.16 --> 00:08:48.16
Chaffey told us he didn't sound apologetic or dismayed by this just stating a fact.

120
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:52.28
He took off as he talked swinging along the top lip of a shallow trench line that followed

121
00:08:52.28 --> 00:08:58.20
the ridge, linking large and small bunkers 20 to 50 yards apart.

122
00:08:58.20 --> 00:09:01.64
As we moved along the length of the company line, Chaffey stopped to talk with each

123
00:09:01.64 --> 00:09:04.000
Marine at each bunker.

124
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.36
He called each man by name, not Christian names or nicknames as they do in war movies,

125
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:11.32
but the man's proper name.

126
00:09:11.32 --> 00:09:15.60
He didn't make introductions but was business like in a cheerful way.

127
00:09:15.60 --> 00:09:20.48
At the bunkers, Marines were shifting sandbags, cleaning rifles, cooking rations over

128
00:09:20.48 --> 00:09:25.76
small, primeestone, stoves, one Marine cutting another's hair.

129
00:09:25.76 --> 00:09:29.44
No one seemed fussed by the captain's presence.

130
00:09:29.44 --> 00:09:37.16
None of the of the secretiveness or make work you saw at Quantico intended to impress.

131
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:40.48
Chaffey's questions dealt with enemy activity to the front.

132
00:09:40.48 --> 00:09:44.16
The conduct of an ambush sent out the night before the possibility of getting some

133
00:09:44.16 --> 00:09:50.16
mortar fire laden on a suspicious looking piece of ground off to the right and so on.

134
00:09:50.16 --> 00:09:55.24
No chat about rations or leave or letters from their girls.

135
00:09:55.24 --> 00:10:02.24
They were all eating the same rations that it was no leave, a man's mail was private.

136
00:10:02.24 --> 00:10:07.36
Here and there I noticed there were blackened places in the snow where incoming shells

137
00:10:07.36 --> 00:10:08.76
had hit.

138
00:10:08.76 --> 00:10:11.48
No one mentioned them.

139
00:10:11.48 --> 00:10:13.56
The company frontage was astounding.

140
00:10:13.56 --> 00:10:17.72
Once again, the school solution was in discard.

141
00:10:17.72 --> 00:10:24.44
Dog company under strength was covering about 1,000 yards of front, more than half mile

142
00:10:24.44 --> 00:10:36.04
of rough ground.

143
00:10:36.04 --> 00:10:40.56
Now the company commander jumped into the trench, a dirt corridor waste deep with dirty

144
00:10:40.56 --> 00:10:42.28
snow piled on either lip.

145
00:10:42.28 --> 00:10:47.20
Got to stay in the trench from here on, Chaffey said, show you why in a minute.

146
00:10:47.20 --> 00:10:50.80
They proceed along the trench and eventually meet up with one of the other platoon commanders.

147
00:10:50.80 --> 00:10:53.84
This is Lieutenant Flynn, Chaffey said.

148
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:58.28
Here in his area now, he introduced us and we shook hands.

149
00:10:58.28 --> 00:11:02.72
Flynn too had a mustache but it was scruffy lacking Chaffey's elegance.

150
00:11:02.72 --> 00:11:08.56
He wore no insignia of rank, not even a collar bar and looked like any other marine.

151
00:11:08.56 --> 00:11:09.76
He had a good smile.

152
00:11:09.76 --> 00:11:15.36
Now the reason I brought that piece up is because you can hear Chaffey says, you're in his

153
00:11:15.36 --> 00:11:17.04
area now.

154
00:11:17.04 --> 00:11:19.84
So he's given that ownership to Flynn.

155
00:11:19.84 --> 00:11:21.60
He wants to make sure that everybody knows.

156
00:11:21.60 --> 00:11:25.76
This Flynn's deal down here and that continues.

157
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:27.48
We got back in the trench.

158
00:11:27.48 --> 00:11:30.20
Chaffey let Flynn lead the way.

159
00:11:30.20 --> 00:11:33.08
It was his neighborhood.

160
00:11:33.08 --> 00:11:37.80
Now the trench was head high and even deeper with ammunition boxes said in here and there

161
00:11:37.80 --> 00:11:39.52
as firing steps.

162
00:11:39.52 --> 00:11:42.72
We passed two bunkers each with a heavy machine gun in place.

163
00:11:42.72 --> 00:11:46.24
Here there was no hair cutting and the men were all underground.

164
00:11:46.24 --> 00:11:49.96
So now we're back in old trenches, World War I style.

165
00:11:49.96 --> 00:11:55.84
Each bunker one read had his back to us his face toward the firing port.

166
00:11:55.84 --> 00:11:59.32
Open boxes of grenade stood inside the bunkers.

167
00:11:59.32 --> 00:12:02.52
At the third bunker Flynn tapped on the shoulder of the man on watch.

168
00:12:02.52 --> 00:12:06.08
He backed away and Chaffey squeezed into pier through the port.

169
00:12:06.08 --> 00:12:10.04
He knelt there for what seemed a very long time then he squirmed back out and waved me into

170
00:12:10.04 --> 00:12:11.88
place.

171
00:12:11.88 --> 00:12:17.52
For the first time I was looking at ground that matched my notion of what it would be like.

172
00:12:17.52 --> 00:12:21.32
There were three untidy fences of barbed wire a few yards to the front and some rusty

173
00:12:21.32 --> 00:12:24.64
constant Tina wire looped farther out.

174
00:12:24.64 --> 00:12:33.84
Beyond that we're a field of snow, popped by shell holes, a few scrubbed pines badly chewed

175
00:12:33.84 --> 00:12:37.84
and about a football field away, a long dirty mound of snow.

176
00:12:37.84 --> 00:12:41.68
I turned back and found Flynn's face very close to mine.

177
00:12:41.68 --> 00:12:48.68
Those are the neighbors, the platoon leader said.

178
00:12:48.68 --> 00:12:54.84
Now they continue on a little while longer and then Chaffey tells him, we'll skip the right

179
00:12:54.84 --> 00:12:56.000
flank tonight.

180
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.84
You know Simone is already, Simone is one of the other platoon commanders.

181
00:12:59.84 --> 00:13:05.04
Besides, we only have a little daylight and I want you to get settled in by dark.

182
00:13:05.04 --> 00:13:06.72
You know the division order.

183
00:13:06.72 --> 00:13:11.08
Replacements don't go forward of the MLR for their first five days.

184
00:13:11.08 --> 00:13:14.80
The good order lets you get the lay of the land.

185
00:13:14.80 --> 00:13:19.88
Last summer we lost some new people just because they got mixed up and made a wrong turn.

186
00:13:19.88 --> 00:13:22.52
They just plain got lost.

187
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:27.000
Not their fault of course, but they're gone nonetheless.

188
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.60
Mac looked downcast at being shackled.

189
00:13:29.60 --> 00:13:31.48
Don't worry, Jeffy said.

190
00:13:31.48 --> 00:13:35.60
Five days go pretty fast and we'll count this one day so you only have four to go.

191
00:13:35.60 --> 00:13:40.84
So Mac, Mac Allen, who's all fired up about getting after it.

192
00:13:40.84 --> 00:13:44.36
He hears this rule about you can't go forward until he's been here for five days and he

193
00:13:44.36 --> 00:13:50.08
looks all down-trot and because of that.

194
00:13:50.08 --> 00:13:51.68
Back to the book.

195
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:55.16
They get to a position where they're about to go to sleep.

196
00:13:55.16 --> 00:13:59.32
They're back in a bunker now and he sort of back in the rear but he's a little bit of

197
00:13:59.32 --> 00:14:00.32
the rear.

198
00:14:00.32 --> 00:14:01.32
He's with a more-to-position.

199
00:14:01.32 --> 00:14:04.84
So the more positions obviously aren't right on the front.

200
00:14:04.84 --> 00:14:08.36
So he's back with them and it's time to lay down.

201
00:14:08.36 --> 00:14:09.36
Back to the book.

202
00:14:09.36 --> 00:14:13.60
That was fine and laid down my mind churning with events the day.

203
00:14:13.60 --> 00:14:15.72
Hopes and fears both.

204
00:14:15.72 --> 00:14:18.000
But I was very tired.

205
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.52
Then the air was full of sound.

206
00:14:19.52 --> 00:14:22.08
I sat up, Porterfield and Dodge were gone.

207
00:14:22.08 --> 00:14:24.76
Those are the two guys living in this bunker with them.

208
00:14:24.76 --> 00:14:27.16
I pulled on boots and snatched my helmet.

209
00:14:27.16 --> 00:14:31.08
You slept fully dressed with your webbelt on so I had my Smith and I had the Smith

210
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:32.48
and Wesson.

211
00:14:32.48 --> 00:14:38.32
Outside it was black and then just below me a blinding glare as one of the mortars fired.

212
00:14:38.32 --> 00:14:42.20
It was followed by another off to the side and then by a third.

213
00:14:42.20 --> 00:14:47.08
Somewhere over the ridge there was the rip of machine gun fire and an unfamiliar fire

214
00:14:47.08 --> 00:14:48.56
from another weapon.

215
00:14:48.56 --> 00:14:53.80
I started down the hill to the mortar and placements half sliding on the hard pack snow.

216
00:14:53.80 --> 00:14:55.56
Porterfield grabbed my arm.

217
00:14:55.56 --> 00:14:57.64
Lieutenant you don't have to stir yourself.

218
00:14:57.64 --> 00:14:58.96
You need you sleep.

219
00:14:58.96 --> 00:15:02.24
Then I tell you we'd probably have a fire mission.

220
00:15:02.24 --> 00:15:03.40
What is it?

221
00:15:03.40 --> 00:15:05.80
Gooks are pestering Mr. Flynn again is all.

222
00:15:05.80 --> 00:15:06.80
Listen you hear it?

223
00:15:06.80 --> 00:15:09.40
That's a burp gun.

224
00:15:09.40 --> 00:15:13.96
Once you hear it you'll never mistake it for anything else.

225
00:15:13.96 --> 00:15:17.40
I like how the guys are out there doing this mortar mission and they're just telling the

226
00:15:17.40 --> 00:15:19.32
Lieutenant hey you can just stay in bed.

227
00:15:19.32 --> 00:15:21.88
We got this don't worry about it.

228
00:15:21.88 --> 00:15:25.04
He's all fired up right in down there they're like hey we got this.

229
00:15:25.04 --> 00:15:27.48
We don't you need your beauty sleep there sir.

230
00:15:27.48 --> 00:15:28.48
Just take it easy.

231
00:15:28.48 --> 00:15:31.12
And a burp gun this is a very common weapon.

232
00:15:31.12 --> 00:15:36.48
It's the most common weapon here in the Korean war for the North Koreans.

233
00:15:36.48 --> 00:15:37.64
The North Koreans made it.

234
00:15:37.64 --> 00:15:41.44
It was called a type 49 the Chinese made a version of it called the type 50 it's all

235
00:15:41.44 --> 00:15:53.40
based on a Russian version that was called a KPSH41 and this is a 762 by 25 millimeter

236
00:15:53.40 --> 00:15:54.40
weapon.

237
00:15:54.40 --> 00:16:03.08
So not not the same as an AK 47 little bit smaller around but a very very reliable weapon.

238
00:16:03.08 --> 00:16:07.64
Where they call it a burp gun because it's small nurse because the wood doesn't know

239
00:16:07.64 --> 00:16:12.48
it made noise it makes.

240
00:16:12.48 --> 00:16:13.80
That's why they call it that.

241
00:16:13.80 --> 00:16:18.04
Yeah it seems like a burp would be like a small burst of like quick rounds like machine

242
00:16:18.04 --> 00:16:19.04
them.

243
00:16:19.04 --> 00:16:24.84
I actually I don't think I've heard one but you know you can even say he says listen you

244
00:16:24.84 --> 00:16:29.48
hear it that burp that's a burp gun so it must have had a really distinctive sound when

245
00:16:29.48 --> 00:16:32.80
it fired.

246
00:16:32.80 --> 00:16:37.36
Back to the book the morning offered no evidence of the night.

247
00:16:37.36 --> 00:16:42.52
Porterfield made coffee and said there were no casualties anyone knew of though mortars

248
00:16:42.52 --> 00:16:47.000
might have gotten some people on the other side where they could not be seen.

249
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.36
The other side they called them that or gooks or people they also called our Koreans gooks.

250
00:16:55.36 --> 00:17:00.88
The Chinese were chinks but we weren't facing them right now it was all very matter of

251
00:17:00.88 --> 00:17:02.80
fact how we spoke of the enemy.

252
00:17:02.80 --> 00:17:08.94
Now obviously those are not the politically correct terms to use but obviously I'm

253
00:17:08.94 --> 00:17:11.76
all going to also stick with the book because these are the terms that the guys use back

254
00:17:11.76 --> 00:17:12.76
then.

255
00:17:12.76 --> 00:17:20.60
The term gook from what I understand I read about a little bit it came from there's a

256
00:17:20.60 --> 00:17:26.14
there's a term there's a Korean to say America in or American in Korean the term was

257
00:17:26.14 --> 00:17:34.22
me gook and and so I guess you picture guys meeting you know some Korean soldiers and

258
00:17:34.22 --> 00:17:39.14
they're trying to see if they're Americans and they go me gook and they go oh you're

259
00:17:39.14 --> 00:17:42.26
gook okay cool and that's that kind of stuck.

260
00:17:42.26 --> 00:17:47.50
Kind of like me joko yeah you joko yeah that kind of thing.

261
00:17:47.50 --> 00:17:49.26
That kind of thing.

262
00:17:49.26 --> 00:17:53.14
All right back to the book the next four days would pass slowly I felt self-conscious about

263
00:17:53.14 --> 00:17:57.62
the simplest things should I walk in the trench or a top it if I stayed in it people

264
00:17:57.62 --> 00:18:01.78
might think I was afraid if I stayed out someone might accuse me of drawing fire and being

265
00:18:01.78 --> 00:18:08.34
a damn fool they didn't teach you the finer things at Kwanoko I compromised by walking

266
00:18:08.34 --> 00:18:15.14
a top the trench line but walking slumped so a couple things number one that's the kind

267
00:18:15.14 --> 00:18:19.66
of thing this young leader's thinking about like what do I appear like to the men if

268
00:18:19.66 --> 00:18:25.78
I walk hiding in the trench then I'm a I'm a wimp and if I stand up to tall on the top

269
00:18:25.78 --> 00:18:29.78
of the trench then I'm an idiot so which one do I want to be so he compromised he takes

270
00:18:29.78 --> 00:18:35.10
the little thing I talked about with when jp was on about how guys kind of slump down

271
00:18:35.10 --> 00:18:38.74
a little bit they they crouch there they bow their heads when they're walking around just

272
00:18:38.74 --> 00:18:41.98
to make themselves a little bit of a smaller target that's what he's talking about and

273
00:18:41.98 --> 00:18:45.18
that's what he did that's how he solved that problem.

274
00:18:45.18 --> 00:18:51.42
Now as he as he starts spending more time there he starts meeting the guys and he's very

275
00:18:51.42 --> 00:19:01.78
surprised that they are not exactly as quote unquote squared away as he might anticipate

276
00:19:01.78 --> 00:19:05.50
because these guys are Marines and he's coming from Kwanoko where everything is spit

277
00:19:05.50 --> 00:19:11.30
and polish right back to the book fresh from Kwanoko I knew I should not I should be

278
00:19:11.30 --> 00:19:16.70
righteous about it but it was chaffies company not mine some men wore knee length

279
00:19:16.70 --> 00:19:24.38
parkas others pile vests or field jackets won a forest green overcoat to his ankles

280
00:19:24.38 --> 00:19:30.46
there were stolen army jackets turtle neck sweaters a plaid sweater made respectable

281
00:19:30.46 --> 00:19:37.10
by an issue green scarf tossed jantley over one shoulder there were fur hats and hats

282
00:19:37.10 --> 00:19:43.90
with ear muffs ordinary fatigue caps and a baseball cap wool stocking caps overseas caps

283
00:19:43.90 --> 00:19:50.62
helmets some with green some with tan some without any camouflage cover there were

284
00:19:50.62 --> 00:19:56.90
thermal boots and ordinary boon dockers and jump boots liberated from the army men wore

285
00:19:56.90 --> 00:20:02.74
no insignia or black stripes painted on the sleeve or metal badges of rank I didn't recognize

286
00:20:02.74 --> 00:20:08.34
that they got from every breast pocket gleamed a brass spoon hammered from an old shell

287
00:20:08.34 --> 00:20:15.14
casing a gookspoon I did not know what they were and finally asked one Marine wore

288
00:20:15.14 --> 00:20:20.46
as purple heart another a nineteen forty eight do we for president button so this is

289
00:20:20.46 --> 00:20:24.78
not what he's used to he's used to see it guys totally square away and these guys are

290
00:20:24.78 --> 00:20:32.50
have obviously done whatever they can to try and stay warm back to the book

291
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:37.38
fillups took us out to the right flank to see some onus he seemed glad we were there

292
00:20:37.38 --> 00:20:42.54
but he looked very weary tired though physically and good shape so some onus they had

293
00:20:42.54 --> 00:20:47.38
heard this story that some onus had done a pretty awesome operation where they went

294
00:20:47.38 --> 00:20:52.18
across the valley deep into some enemy control territory and killed a bunch of

295
00:20:52.18 --> 00:20:56.58
North Koreans and then made it back with no casualties so it's kind of a everyone's super

296
00:20:56.58 --> 00:21:02.38
impressed with this operation and back to the book max said something about his patrol

297
00:21:02.38 --> 00:21:07.54
the one young doll was bragging about that was the mission that went across the valley

298
00:21:07.54 --> 00:21:13.38
we were quiet and we were lucky some onus said it was obvious he didn't want to talk

299
00:21:13.38 --> 00:21:19.38
about it he excused himself saying he was inspecting weapons this morning

300
00:21:19.38 --> 00:21:22.98
then as they're walking along all of a sudden fillups moving faster than a pump man

301
00:21:22.98 --> 00:21:27.58
should drop into the trench down he shouted back and I jumped in after him there was

302
00:21:27.58 --> 00:21:31.86
an explosion in backs and black smoke rising somewhere behind us and then another whiz with

303
00:21:31.86 --> 00:21:37.10
a bang on the end of it 76 is Philips said squatting in the bottom of the trench flat

304
00:21:37.10 --> 00:21:42.18
trajectory weapon not as fast as it sounds if you hear the whiz you can usually beat

305
00:21:42.18 --> 00:21:50.46
the bang I looked past him at Alan Mac was beaming were they shooting at us I asked

306
00:21:50.46 --> 00:21:55.94
Philips likely they only wasted two so they couldn't have been serious about it just

307
00:21:55.94 --> 00:22:00.62
trying to instill a little discipline into three damn full marines he didn't seem

308
00:22:00.62 --> 00:22:05.10
angry at being shot at but we stayed in the trench for a hundred yards until it

309
00:22:05.10 --> 00:22:11.18
dropped away below the skyline it was all very casual max pleasure being sheld puzzled

310
00:22:11.18 --> 00:22:16.42
me one thing to be gun-ho about going to war another to be delighted someone was

311
00:22:16.42 --> 00:22:25.34
shooting at you max fired up this is pretty cool talking about the he's getting

312
00:22:25.34 --> 00:22:30.06
some education now from one of the one of the enlisted marines named Dodge and

313
00:22:30.06 --> 00:22:37.10
Dodge says most of the enemy weapons are Russian and the Russians are pretty smart

314
00:22:37.10 --> 00:22:42.62
about weapons their mortars are one millimeter larger in diameter than ours we got

315
00:22:42.62 --> 00:22:49.34
sixties and eighty ones they got sixty ones and eighty twos so they can use

316
00:22:49.34 --> 00:22:54.22
captured american mortar shells they slide in easy and just a little fraction loose

317
00:22:54.22 --> 00:23:00.22
but we can't use their shells they're just a tad too big for our tubes so

318
00:23:00.22 --> 00:23:06.34
Soviet unions pretty smart when they came up with that idea with that plan

319
00:23:06.34 --> 00:23:10.06
back to the book around three o'clock off the left there was a sudden mash of

320
00:23:10.06 --> 00:23:14.30
incoming mortar fire than a distant shouting chaffy just back from a scouting

321
00:23:14.30 --> 00:23:17.90
with scouting mission with lisman took off along the ridge towards flint's

322
00:23:17.90 --> 00:23:21.94
position I started to go but red Phillips barked to me stay put till we know

323
00:23:21.94 --> 00:23:26.46
what happened then Phillips phone rang it was flint four of his men

324
00:23:26.46 --> 00:23:30.38
sending themselves on top of a bunker taken a direct hit from an eighty two

325
00:23:30.38 --> 00:23:35.58
millimeter mortars of a gooks and thrown up without notice just one shell but two

326
00:23:35.58 --> 00:23:40.14
the Marines were dead another had lost both legs and the fourth was badly

327
00:23:40.14 --> 00:23:47.10
hold they brought them down past the CP the dead shrouded in ponchos the

328
00:23:47.10 --> 00:23:52.86
wounded conscious and in pain I stood watching feeling a stranger one of the

329
00:23:52.86 --> 00:23:57.98
dead was cousin to the man whose legs were gone they came from a town in

330
00:23:57.98 --> 00:24:02.90
Massachusetts the Marine without legs didn't seem to realize about his legs but

331
00:24:02.90 --> 00:24:07.22
he was talking about his cousin poor ready he said what's at his mother gonna

332
00:24:07.22 --> 00:24:13.34
say chaffy was with them at the corner at one corner of the four men carrying

333
00:24:13.34 --> 00:24:17.86
Eddie in the poncho he turned it over to someone else and went into the CP

334
00:24:17.86 --> 00:24:22.54
Phillips and I following get some onus chaffy said tell him to send three men up

335
00:24:22.54 --> 00:24:26.38
to flint for tonight to fill in the line tell him to thin out his own people

336
00:24:26.38 --> 00:24:29.66
where he can I'll try getting him some more men in the morning he can have

337
00:24:29.66 --> 00:24:33.74
my runners if he can't if I can't get anybody else they'll have that

338
00:24:33.74 --> 00:24:38.54
bunker okay before dark it wasn't banged up too badly the men took most of it

339
00:24:38.54 --> 00:24:44.90
while Phillips made the call chaffy turned to me well that happens no one to blame

340
00:24:44.90 --> 00:24:49.18
blame the sunshine if you have to lay blame Truman himself couldn't keep

341
00:24:49.18 --> 00:24:54.34
Marines from getting some sun good men too he hate to lose them anyway but

342
00:24:54.34 --> 00:25:00.50
losing them like this is stupid it hurts even more we learn though you won't

343
00:25:00.50 --> 00:25:04.66
see anyone goping off on top of a bunker for a while he picked up the

344
00:25:04.66 --> 00:25:10.86
battalion phone to call in the casualties so you can see chaffy's got like a

345
00:25:10.86 --> 00:25:16.30
a certain level of detachment right he's he's got a fair I would say it's

346
00:25:16.30 --> 00:25:21.58
actually a very good level of detachment where he's even in his own sentence

347
00:25:21.58 --> 00:25:25.42
he's saying it's horrible lose these guys no one to blame we need to move

348
00:25:25.42 --> 00:25:31.26
forward it's like the right level of he it hurts he says it hurts even more but

349
00:25:31.26 --> 00:25:36.46
he's not going crazy he's not beating himself up he's got job to do so there's a

350
00:25:36.46 --> 00:25:40.14
good level detachment that he's got going on and you're gonna hear more about

351
00:25:40.14 --> 00:25:47.34
that as well now this was interesting you know on on social media people are

352
00:25:47.34 --> 00:25:53.46
always asking about EDC which is everyday carry they say talk with your EDC what

353
00:25:53.46 --> 00:25:56.66
do you carry every day that's what that's what people want to know and when I

354
00:25:56.66 --> 00:26:01.82
read this this paragraph here I was thinking this is the EDC the everyday carry

355
00:26:01.82 --> 00:26:09.22
for the Korean War so when they ask you your EDC is a gun or just everything

356
00:26:09.22 --> 00:26:14.06
you carry knife what do you care for nice and wallet you know you're your

357
00:26:14.06 --> 00:26:21.44
various things that you carry yeah EDC yeah yeah all right back to the book

358
00:26:21.44 --> 00:26:25.86
talking EDC we forgot a lot of what they taught us at Quantico but I remember I

359
00:26:25.86 --> 00:26:30.14
remember Joe Will's lecture Will was a captain who'd been in the hard

360
00:26:30.14 --> 00:26:34.66
fighting around the poos around poos on the first summer of the war there were

361
00:26:34.66 --> 00:26:39.86
pictures of Will and his men in life magazine Will had really been to Korea and

362
00:26:39.86 --> 00:26:44.90
fought and so we listened and took notes Will didn't talk about war aims or

363
00:26:44.90 --> 00:26:51.50
strategy or even small unit tactics he told you what to take to Korea in your

364
00:26:51.50 --> 00:26:56.82
pockets nail clippers if your nails grew too long they caught on things and

365
00:26:56.82 --> 00:27:00.94
became jagged or maybe even ripped off one-a-day vitamins you were gonna miss

366
00:27:00.94 --> 00:27:04.18
meals and there was no fresh fruit or milk and you need to vitamins to keep

367
00:27:04.18 --> 00:27:08.42
you going a knife not to kill people with but just a boy scout knife with a

368
00:27:08.42 --> 00:27:13.18
couple of blades and a screwdriver and all toilet paper there was a package

369
00:27:13.18 --> 00:27:17.54
in every ration box but there was never enough a flashlight she then black

370
00:27:17.54 --> 00:27:23.38
rubber for insulation and against hard knocks a pen and a small smile spiral

371
00:27:23.38 --> 00:27:28.14
notebook you wanted to keep track of your men and to be able to write lists to

372
00:27:28.14 --> 00:27:33.22
leave notes for people a good watch with a luminous dial you could read at night a

373
00:27:33.22 --> 00:27:38.86
couple of good-sized bandanas you could use his hanker chiefs they were you were

374
00:27:38.86 --> 00:27:43.38
always wet and we're gonna catch a cold and your nose would run a toothbrush

375
00:27:43.38 --> 00:27:49.18
and toothpaste a small bar of soap a razor of course the soap will also work

376
00:27:49.18 --> 00:27:53.98
the shaving cream some raw-hide leather thongs in case your shoelaces broke or

377
00:27:53.98 --> 00:27:59.10
you had to make jury rig repairs to something a plastic bag keep your wallet in

378
00:27:59.10 --> 00:28:04.62
when you got wet an extra pair of wool socks a zip-o-liter for smoking and

379
00:28:04.62 --> 00:28:09.98
lighting fires you didn't need any stamps or money there was nothing to buy

380
00:28:09.98 --> 00:28:16.10
and no place to send it the dog tags went around your neck you hung them from a

381
00:28:16.10 --> 00:28:20.06
leather from leather thong at different lengths so they didn't clink together

382
00:28:20.06 --> 00:28:24.54
and make noise you wore two dog tags so that if you were killed they would cut

383
00:28:24.54 --> 00:28:28.14
one off and turn it into the graves registration or some other authority and

384
00:28:28.14 --> 00:28:32.82
leave one on the body to ensure accurate identification the Marine Corps had a

385
00:28:32.82 --> 00:28:37.26
system for just about everything people at Cuanoco said Joe will did some

386
00:28:37.26 --> 00:28:42.46
drinking nights at the officer's club but he gave a good lecture and most of us

387
00:28:42.46 --> 00:28:46.86
remembered when he told us as I was as I was pretty sure I was going to

388
00:28:46.86 --> 00:28:52.22
remember what I was learning now from chaffy philips and textless lisman and

389
00:28:52.22 --> 00:29:04.46
sergeant dodge so there's your EDC for Korea it's it's amazing how some of

390
00:29:04.46 --> 00:29:10.82
that small stuff gets like in the seal teams that's kind of thing that you'd

391
00:29:10.82 --> 00:29:14.30
get turned over from somebody that was in an area where you were and you'd be

392
00:29:14.30 --> 00:29:18.26
all happy to get these good turnovers so somebody say hey you really need this

393
00:29:18.26 --> 00:29:22.58
up here you need that and it'd be always good and it'd be bad when you'd forget

394
00:29:22.58 --> 00:29:26.50
or someone wouldn't give you a good turnover and you'd say wait a second I should

395
00:29:26.50 --> 00:29:31.10
have had this why why didn't anybody tell us that stuff and it was interesting too

396
00:29:31.10 --> 00:29:34.82
because when we first got over to one of my first deployment to Iraq man we

397
00:29:34.82 --> 00:29:38.82
were learning so many lessons about what was going on one of the biggest was

398
00:29:38.82 --> 00:29:43.42
how we were operating in humvies all time because we didn't really do that

399
00:29:43.42 --> 00:29:46.34
much before the war started solve us and we were just learning a lesson

400
00:29:46.34 --> 00:29:50.54
a day in how to operate with humvies and we just logged it all down and

401
00:29:50.54 --> 00:29:55.22
pass it on so the next guys knew what was coming and capture those lessons

402
00:29:55.22 --> 00:30:00.78
learned and pass them on and by the way when you're coming into theater and you

403
00:30:00.78 --> 00:30:03.26
haven't done the job whatever job some that you're taking over from somebody

404
00:30:03.26 --> 00:30:06.62
listen to whatever they're telling you don't go in with your preconceived

405
00:30:06.62 --> 00:30:09.86
notions you might have your own ideas that's fine I'm not saying don't have your

406
00:30:09.86 --> 00:30:13.34
own ideas but listen to what people are telling you because they're gonna know

407
00:30:13.34 --> 00:30:21.70
some things that you don't know and that's all there is to it all right now

408
00:30:21.70 --> 00:30:26.78
there's a point where it looks like chaffee's gonna decide which one of

409
00:30:26.78 --> 00:30:31.18
these two guys Brady or Mac Allen is gonna get to take over his

410
00:30:31.18 --> 00:30:39.14
platoon commander and they're actually gonna do a a coin flip to decide so

411
00:30:39.14 --> 00:30:43.10
that's just who it is and it turns out that Brady wins the coin toss well

412
00:30:43.10 --> 00:30:47.66
it's your platoon now Brady chaffee says chaffee says I won't worry about how you'll

413
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:51.78
do both of you are ready to take platoon's you'll get yours soon Allen when

414
00:30:51.78 --> 00:30:56.54
Flynn goes home the thing to remember is we were all platoon leaders once a

415
00:30:56.54 --> 00:31:02.94
good job the finest command a man can have no where I don't care how long you

416
00:31:02.94 --> 00:31:07.54
live or what you do will you ever have direct responsibility for so many

417
00:31:07.54 --> 00:31:12.86
men you can command more men you can be a general with a division but it's

418
00:31:12.86 --> 00:31:18.10
no longer direct kernels and generals are nodded into the system the whole

419
00:31:18.10 --> 00:31:24.50
military bureaucracy you make your own system here you run it it's year

420
00:31:24.50 --> 00:31:31.98
platoon and I have to agree with the fact of being a platoon commander is

421
00:31:31.98 --> 00:31:38.22
awesome and you have total control and I will say this though I always

422
00:31:38.22 --> 00:31:42.10
looked at every job like that like every job I got my own you know in time

423
00:31:42.10 --> 00:31:46.22
I get put in charge of something whether I got put in charge of radios when I

424
00:31:46.22 --> 00:31:49.78
was a new guy and I just had to be in charge of any people I was in charge of

425
00:31:49.78 --> 00:31:54.18
radios I was like oh yeah I'm gonna set these radios up like this I'm gonna

426
00:31:54.18 --> 00:31:59.98
make make that my world right and then when I was got promoted and I was a

427
00:31:59.98 --> 00:32:04.62
squad leader and all of a sudden yeah I'm like this my squad and we gonna do

428
00:32:04.62 --> 00:32:10.06
things and so I always to have that feeling of what is basically a feeling of

429
00:32:10.06 --> 00:32:13.70
ownership right I'll take ownership and I always did that but he's right in the

430
00:32:13.70 --> 00:32:19.34
fact that once you go above Tune Commander now there's gonna be other there's

431
00:32:19.34 --> 00:32:23.42
gonna be someone else that's gonna actually own those guys and it's not you

432
00:32:23.42 --> 00:32:26.78
so you gotta give those two commanders some space so they can do their thing

433
00:32:26.78 --> 00:32:32.08
what a good job when you get that opportunity for a platoon sergeant

434
00:32:32.08 --> 00:32:38.02
a platoon chief or a platoon commander it's it's about as good as it's gonna get in

435
00:32:38.02 --> 00:32:46.14
my personal opinion all right here's here's a again I talked about how how

436
00:32:46.14 --> 00:32:50.94
Chaffey's sort of the reason why I wanted to do this book and this is a classic

437
00:32:50.94 --> 00:32:55.38
example good leadership lesson learned for anybody here back to the book

438
00:32:55.38 --> 00:33:01.98
another order came up which sounded dumb so dumb I thought Chaffey was

439
00:33:01.98 --> 00:33:06.94
jolly in us the order was to pick up all the brass expended along the line and

440
00:33:06.94 --> 00:33:11.90
send it back for salvage brass is the military term for empty shell casings

441
00:33:11.90 --> 00:33:16.86
ejected from weapons when bullets are fired in the states on the firing range

442
00:33:16.86 --> 00:33:20.74
you're supposed to pick up the brass to police the area to keep it neat but here

443
00:33:20.74 --> 00:33:26.14
the following morning Chaffey as usual was up and down the company front with

444
00:33:26.14 --> 00:33:30.98
his wolf slope moving fast without seeming to seeing everything knowing

445
00:33:30.98 --> 00:33:36.58
everyone he called me into the CP when he got back your machine gunners aren't

446
00:33:36.58 --> 00:33:41.26
picking up the brass it's piled up around the guns and down the slope did you

447
00:33:41.26 --> 00:33:48.38
give them the order I said I hadn't considered it a serious order all orders

448
00:33:48.38 --> 00:33:54.94
are serious chaffey said in turn away I was ashamed and angry it was a ridiculous

449
00:33:54.94 --> 00:33:58.62
order but chaffey was right I should have carried it out now he caught me

450
00:33:58.62 --> 00:34:05.02
doping off this was a chaffey this was a chaffey I hadn't seen before a man

451
00:34:05.02 --> 00:34:10.10
with whom you didn't play games I would not again I didn't want to look I didn't

452
00:34:10.10 --> 00:34:15.86
want that cold look coming down on me again he didn't shout or curse when he

453
00:34:15.86 --> 00:34:23.22
chewed you out but he didn't have to you understood so that's any of these

454
00:34:23.22 --> 00:34:26.06
anybody that thinks they're yelling and screaming that's having this huge

455
00:34:26.06 --> 00:34:29.98
impact you're probably wrong you're probably wrong you should sell them

456
00:34:29.98 --> 00:34:35.06
have to do that fear and a leadership position back to the book I hustled down

457
00:34:35.06 --> 00:34:37.94
the line to give the necessary orders to the gunners who looked at me as if

458
00:34:37.94 --> 00:34:43.66
I were mad I said they were chaffey's orders and to be obeyed shrugging and

459
00:34:43.66 --> 00:34:48.50
sulky they started picking up the brass so what does he do what is Brady do he

460
00:34:48.50 --> 00:34:50.82
gets down there says hey guys pick up the brass when they start looking at him

461
00:34:50.82 --> 00:34:53.70
like all this is ridiculous he goes hey look it's chaffey chaffey told us to do

462
00:34:53.70 --> 00:34:58.66
it so do it which is not good leadership that's not good leadership right he's

463
00:34:58.66 --> 00:35:02.98
passing the buck on up the chain of command a this is bosses this is the bosses

464
00:35:02.98 --> 00:35:08.30
plan I don't agree with it but we have to do it anyways wrong and he finds out

465
00:35:08.30 --> 00:35:13.18
just how wrong it is here back to the book it was not until later I learned

466
00:35:13.18 --> 00:35:19.66
that the order was from young doll and that chaffey too thought it was inane but

467
00:35:19.66 --> 00:35:26.70
in dog company he issued orders as if they were his own idea without passing the

468
00:35:26.70 --> 00:35:32.30
buck or permitting any reflection on higher authority it would take time before

469
00:35:32.30 --> 00:35:36.62
I learned to do the same so when you pass that word you can argue all day

470
00:35:36.62 --> 00:35:40.74
long up the chain of command but once the decision's been made and now you're

471
00:35:40.74 --> 00:35:45.10
talking to the boys that's your order now that's your plan that's your idea you

472
00:35:45.10 --> 00:35:48.10
own it

473
00:35:50.58 --> 00:35:55.74
all right now they spend a little bit more time up on the line and the

474
00:35:55.74 --> 00:36:00.06
make-o-back to the reserves into the rear for a little while and when they go

475
00:36:00.06 --> 00:36:05.46
back to the rear it's their their marine so they're continuing to stay

476
00:36:05.46 --> 00:36:09.78
disciplined they call them night problems with that means exercises when I say

477
00:36:09.78 --> 00:36:12.78
problems sometimes I'm gonna forget to say this but when they say problems they're

478
00:36:12.78 --> 00:36:17.10
talking about exercises back to the book the night problems went on in the

479
00:36:17.10 --> 00:36:21.06
inspections and drills and all the chicken shit of reserve area chicken shit is

480
00:36:21.06 --> 00:36:23.82
a term that they use in the military is just stupid stuff that they make

481
00:36:23.82 --> 00:36:27.38
you for no reason right it's just a common term is that all this is chicken

482
00:36:27.38 --> 00:36:31.66
shit like hey we're gonna paint these paint these rocks white that's the big

483
00:36:31.66 --> 00:36:35.70
thing you know we're gonna clean this sidewalk again hey we're gonna sweep up

484
00:36:35.70 --> 00:36:39.06
the parade ground again we've swept the yesterday we're gonna sweep it again

485
00:36:39.06 --> 00:36:44.62
let's just check and shit stuff the weather got colder and worse but I began

486
00:36:44.62 --> 00:36:50.42
to feel wonderful suddenly I stopped thinking about minds and about losing my

487
00:36:50.42 --> 00:36:54.30
legs the hell with it worrying it and being afraid wasn't going to help

488
00:36:54.30 --> 00:36:59.26
after that I felt fine one afternoon coming back from a live fire problem

489
00:36:59.26 --> 00:37:02.82
Mac Allen and I were in such high spirits we fell behind the party just to

490
00:37:02.82 --> 00:37:07.42
wrestle in the snow out of pure delight I was easy for Mac but we had a fine

491
00:37:07.42 --> 00:37:12.14
time and rolled halfway down the bank and nearly into a stream Mac scrub my

492
00:37:12.14 --> 00:37:16.54
face with snow before we quit and stuff to handful down my shirt it was

493
00:37:16.54 --> 00:37:21.50
boyish it was silly and we knew it but with another tour on the line coming up

494
00:37:21.50 --> 00:37:25.70
you took pleasure where you could so he's he's got a little attitude change

495
00:37:25.70 --> 00:37:29.66
number one he's over this idea of being afraid of minds and being afraid

496
00:37:29.66 --> 00:37:33.34
he's like hey I can't control it do everything I can't mitigate but it is

497
00:37:33.34 --> 00:37:37.78
what it is and then of course sometimes you got to get a little roll in

498
00:37:37.78 --> 00:37:47.50
little bit of a roll and now they get back back on the line and again I'm

499
00:37:47.50 --> 00:37:51.06
obviously skipping sections of this because I'm not going to read the whole book

500
00:37:51.06 --> 00:37:57.66
you should read the whole book but they're back on the line and now Brady is

501
00:37:57.66 --> 00:38:03.62
in charge of a platoon he's a platoon commander and Chaffee comes around to to

502
00:38:03.62 --> 00:38:10.26
check out his kind of his his section of the line back to the book my bunker

503
00:38:10.26 --> 00:38:15.10
was toward the base of the nose where it joined the main ridge so nose a little

504
00:38:15.10 --> 00:38:20.18
little terrain feature that stuck out and that's where his bunker is I showed

505
00:38:20.18 --> 00:38:24.54
Chaffee over the ground not going all the way to either flank it was too late

506
00:38:24.54 --> 00:38:29.78
for that and dark was coming but I gave him the gist of it keep 50% of men on

507
00:38:29.78 --> 00:38:34.22
watching till I tell you different all right I I sir this looks like a good

508
00:38:34.22 --> 00:38:40.22
line Brady better than the last yes it does sir we've got work to do though

509
00:38:40.22 --> 00:38:45.50
get some more wire in plot the minds and don't get too relaxed just because it's

510
00:38:45.50 --> 00:38:50.70
high any hill marines can climb down the gooks can climb up get relaxed and you'll

511
00:38:50.70 --> 00:38:56.02
find trouble I said I wasn't too relaxed Chaffee greeted that with a grin I

512
00:38:56.02 --> 00:39:01.26
don't imagine you are first night on the line with a new platoon I laughed it

513
00:39:01.26 --> 00:39:04.86
was getting late the sun gone now but Chaffee walked away but Chaffee

514
00:39:04.86 --> 00:39:10.66
walked with me for a way the two of us alone not much I want to say Brady you'll

515
00:39:10.66 --> 00:39:15.06
do a fine job for me I'm not worried about that but one thing they don't tell

516
00:39:15.06 --> 00:39:20.06
you at quannico and maybe they should get to know your people as marines as

517
00:39:20.06 --> 00:39:25.78
professionals learn their capacities their strengths their weaknesses but don't

518
00:39:25.78 --> 00:39:30.14
get to know them as men none of this first name stuff don't ask about their

519
00:39:30.14 --> 00:39:35.50
families or their hometown whether they're married if they've got kids do that

520
00:39:35.50 --> 00:39:40.38
and before you know it you'll lose your judgment you'll be sending a man out on

521
00:39:40.38 --> 00:39:45.46
point because he's single and not because he's the best point man there's

522
00:39:45.46 --> 00:39:50.22
something else get to know your men too well too personally and when you lose one

523
00:39:50.22 --> 00:39:54.90
you'll be losing a piece of yourself a platoon leader can't afford that

524
00:39:54.90 --> 00:40:01.82
it's bad enough losing men without losing pieces of you too remember that

525
00:40:01.82 --> 00:40:08.82
Brady it's hard learned and it's right I said I would remember Chaffee went off

526
00:40:08.82 --> 00:40:13.18
bouncing along the icy path and down the hacked out steps the reverse slope in

527
00:40:13.18 --> 00:40:19.38
the gloom a lean tireless figure who did not look back who told you what to

528
00:40:19.38 --> 00:40:28.86
do and left you to do it now that that section obviously in in in the

529
00:40:28.86 --> 00:40:32.66
seal teams in special operations in general there's definitely a much closer

530
00:40:32.66 --> 00:40:37.90
relationship between the officers and the senior enlisted guys and the

531
00:40:37.90 --> 00:40:41.34
troopers that just the way it is I mean you're doing everything together you're

532
00:40:41.34 --> 00:40:44.46
going through training together you're you're doing everything together so you that

533
00:40:44.46 --> 00:40:53.90
that that wall between the ranks definitely gets degraded somewhat and this is

534
00:40:53.90 --> 00:40:57.22
something that I talk about all the time and this is part of the dichotomy of

535
00:40:57.22 --> 00:41:00.42
leadership right this is part of the dichotomy of leadership and and what you do

536
00:41:00.42 --> 00:41:04.34
is you know you're gonna have your relationships with your guys but you got to

537
00:41:04.34 --> 00:41:09.34
make sure that you're not you gotta make sure you keep those on a control and and

538
00:41:09.34 --> 00:41:15.66
like for me I was it was fairly easy for me to have really good relationships

539
00:41:15.66 --> 00:41:20.62
with guys to have to have guys that were my best freaking friends and be like okay

540
00:41:20.62 --> 00:41:23.70
and you're the best guy for this job so you're gonna go to that and I didn't

541
00:41:23.70 --> 00:41:30.22
I I never let the personal things crossover into my business in my my

542
00:41:30.22 --> 00:41:36.90
tactical reasoning ever it just didn't happen and that's why I definitely had

543
00:41:36.90 --> 00:41:39.94
better relationships close relationships than what Chaffey's talking about here

544
00:41:39.94 --> 00:41:45.30
no doubt about it you know and I think that's beneficial in a lot of ways

545
00:41:45.30 --> 00:41:51.86
because yeah you know you know what's making guys tick and obviously the down

546
00:41:51.86 --> 00:41:58.30
fault of that is that when you do lose guys you are gonna lose a PCU and that's

547
00:41:58.30 --> 00:42:14.38
the reality of it now going back to the book he gets another visit from the

548
00:42:14.38 --> 00:42:19.34
kernel the kernel comes up on the line so the guy above above Chaffey and the

549
00:42:19.34 --> 00:42:22.38
chain of command comes up same thing just looking at his trench in what he's

550
00:42:22.38 --> 00:42:29.22
got going on back to the book the kernel said where are your machine guns the answer

551
00:42:29.22 --> 00:42:34.14
was I didn't know exactly what I said was they're down with the squads the first

552
00:42:34.14 --> 00:42:39.10
squad has won and the second and the lieutenant what bonkers are your machine

553
00:42:39.10 --> 00:42:43.42
goes in guns in do you know they're fields of fire how would they late do you

554
00:42:43.42 --> 00:42:49.86
have aiming stakes in no sir you should know shouldn't you yes sir then find out

555
00:42:49.86 --> 00:42:56.22
I sir the words floated in the crisp cold of the hill as the kernel hop gently

556
00:42:56.22 --> 00:43:01.34
into his chopper and left I got on the phone to call Chaffey I told him I thought

557
00:43:01.34 --> 00:43:05.82
I'd better since the kernel surely would Chaffey didn't say much over the phone

558
00:43:05.82 --> 00:43:11.94
well he said I guess you better go out and chart your guns head and you now this

559
00:43:11.94 --> 00:43:17.74
is something if you're in a leadership position and you get inspected up the chain

560
00:43:17.74 --> 00:43:22.34
command you and you said yourself oh should I tell my immediate boss that

561
00:43:22.34 --> 00:43:27.10
something's gonna come back yes you should is the answer yes you should don't

562
00:43:27.10 --> 00:43:31.10
let your boss is get you don't ever want your boss to get blindsided with

563
00:43:31.10 --> 00:43:34.30
something same thing you know in the military we'd have guys getting trouble out

564
00:43:34.30 --> 00:43:39.42
in town yeah and like get arrested kind of some kind of stuff get arrested getting

565
00:43:39.42 --> 00:43:44.22
a fight whatever now this is this is what I how would I would handle those

566
00:43:44.22 --> 00:43:49.66
situations if I could contain them right if I could contain them myself and I

567
00:43:49.66 --> 00:43:54.26
could punish the guy myself on handlet at my level I would do it but if it was

568
00:43:54.26 --> 00:43:57.58
something that was gonna get out of control and we weren't gonna be able to

569
00:43:57.58 --> 00:44:00.02
stop it if it was gonna be in a newspaper or something like that well then I

570
00:44:00.02 --> 00:44:03.86
tell my boss like this is what happened I had one of my idiot guys went out

571
00:44:03.86 --> 00:44:08.14
got drunk out and fight went out call some problems this is what happened so

572
00:44:08.14 --> 00:44:10.70
that way he's not getting blindsided by it he can prepare for it he can

573
00:44:10.70 --> 00:44:13.78
have an answer he can say that this is the punish that's being dealt out or

574
00:44:13.78 --> 00:44:18.06
whatever get the thing handled yeah so when something like this happens tell your

575
00:44:18.06 --> 00:44:22.70
boss what's going on just it's gonna be uncomfortable for those 12 seconds

576
00:44:22.70 --> 00:44:26.10
that it takes for you to get those words out of your mouth once those words out

577
00:44:26.10 --> 00:44:30.46
of your mouth I promise you'll feel better you will definitely feel better

578
00:44:30.46 --> 00:44:34.86
back to the book chaff he didn't say anything more he didn't need to but I

579
00:44:34.86 --> 00:44:38.22
knew there was plenty he would have said there was plenty the kernel of the

580
00:44:38.22 --> 00:44:42.30
regiment would say to the kernel of a Italian who in his turn and in the

581
00:44:42.30 --> 00:44:46.38
hallowed traditions of the core would have a few words for chaffy I felt

582
00:44:46.38 --> 00:44:50.38
pretty bad it seemed unfair a fine officer like chaffy a good man should

583
00:44:50.38 --> 00:44:56.58
suffer because a green junior officer dope off but it was the way things were

584
00:44:56.58 --> 00:45:02.58
and the way it had to be later in the day chaffy met with fillups and the three

585
00:45:02.58 --> 00:45:08.86
platoon leaders he stressed as a might a teacher in kindergarten the importance

586
00:45:08.86 --> 00:45:13.82
of basic things the precise location of machine guns being only one of

587
00:45:13.82 --> 00:45:19.54
these fundamentals he made no reference to the kernel none to me he simply

588
00:45:19.54 --> 00:45:23.98
reminded us of the things he wanted done and said he expected them to be done

589
00:45:23.98 --> 00:45:28.42
then he and fillups loped off to look at something in the rest of us drifted back

590
00:45:28.42 --> 00:45:32.42
to our platoons I wanted to tell the rest of them it was my fault we'd been

591
00:45:32.42 --> 00:45:38.70
lectured I wanted to hug trat chaffy for not saying so these were mistakes that

592
00:45:38.70 --> 00:45:42.98
came with still being an amateur in a professional's war so there's another just

593
00:45:42.98 --> 00:45:47.66
great example of leadership he couldn't he could hammer Brady and say look

594
00:45:47.66 --> 00:45:50.34
Brady did this and he doesn't know what his guys are doing and he didn't know

595
00:45:50.34 --> 00:45:55.30
where's machine guns are made us all look bad he didn't do that no no and said

596
00:45:55.30 --> 00:45:58.70
he doesn't mention Brady's name he tells everybody they got to get stuff done

597
00:45:58.70 --> 00:46:04.22
now it is Brady want to do better for him yes he absolutely does he's building

598
00:46:04.22 --> 00:46:08.22
that building up that leadership capital with his troops by not drop and

599
00:46:08.22 --> 00:46:11.34
dime on somebody making out an example out of now is there times where you have

600
00:46:11.34 --> 00:46:14.94
to do that of course there is but this one was nothing major right a

601
00:46:14.94 --> 00:46:19.50
little stern talking to you from the kernel hey I can absorb that not gonna

602
00:46:19.50 --> 00:46:24.74
not gonna make Brady look bad but I'm gonna build up that loyalty

603
00:46:24.74 --> 00:46:36.06
yeah now they go out in operation in a guy named Fitz gets wounded and it

604
00:46:36.06 --> 00:46:40.94
almost he's he and Brady's actually also very close to the mine that goes off

605
00:46:40.94 --> 00:46:46.94
but he's okay and at night he gets back to his bunker and there's a guy named

606
00:46:46.94 --> 00:46:50.70
Princeton who's taken over his senior enlisted guy kind of his sergeant that's

607
00:46:50.70 --> 00:46:55.58
working for him and here we go back to the book that night I worked hard at

608
00:46:55.58 --> 00:47:00.22
tidying my half of the bunker eight very little but enjoyed what I had and tried

609
00:47:00.22 --> 00:47:04.86
unsuccessfully to get Princeton to talk about the days events I gave that up

610
00:47:04.86 --> 00:47:08.86
and wrote a number of letters separate ones to my mother and father telling them

611
00:47:08.86 --> 00:47:13.02
what happened and that I was okay and that I love them and another to a girl

612
00:47:13.02 --> 00:47:18.62
the girls tall and lean and very pretty and quite exciting but we had never

613
00:47:18.62 --> 00:47:23.74
really meant anything to each other now I wrote her quite dramatically that I

614
00:47:23.74 --> 00:47:27.58
nearly been killed that my eyes had been opened and as soon as I got back we

615
00:47:27.58 --> 00:47:32.34
should begin to consider the future we've wasted an awful lot of time you and I

616
00:47:32.34 --> 00:47:39.14
the letter concluded it was a college boys letter and in the morning I tore up

617
00:47:39.14 --> 00:47:43.70
all three letters chiding myself for being calo and sent a free paragraph letter

618
00:47:43.70 --> 00:47:49.14
home in which I discussed the weather in some detail Princeton who wrote to his

619
00:47:49.14 --> 00:47:55.22
wife once a month shook his head over all this correspondence I just love

620
00:47:55.22 --> 00:47:59.62
that he's he's just growing up he's growing up fast on the line in Korea

621
00:47:59.62 --> 00:48:03.46
first he's right good girl I almost got killed and this is what's going on and I

622
00:48:03.46 --> 00:48:06.58
get what we need to consider our future together he just rips that up in the

623
00:48:06.58 --> 00:48:11.62
morning and then writes his parents about the weather that's classic

624
00:48:12.66 --> 00:48:15.94
and I totally agree with Princeton who's right and what you don't if you're on

625
00:48:15.94 --> 00:48:19.46
deployment don't get in this mode where you're spending all your time trying to

626
00:48:19.46 --> 00:48:23.06
thinking about what's going on back home concentrate on what you're doing overseas

627
00:48:23.06 --> 00:48:26.74
the most but the best thing you can do for your family it's concentrate on what you're

628
00:48:26.74 --> 00:48:31.94
doing overseas so you can lift and you can win that's what you want to focus on

629
00:48:31.94 --> 00:48:36.02
you let your family you know contact them once a week hey what's going on

630
00:48:36.02 --> 00:48:39.14
everything I'm doing great that's another thing is you know you don't need to tell

631
00:48:39.14 --> 00:48:43.70
your family back home all the stuff that's going on just say look we're doing

632
00:48:43.70 --> 00:48:47.38
great I'm having the best time it's a lot of fun miss you and I'll be home

633
00:48:47.38 --> 00:48:53.54
whatever I hope every house Johnny's you know grades in kindergarten let's talk

634
00:48:53.54 --> 00:48:57.70
about that how's it how's he like in his jiu jitsu class is he working on his

635
00:48:57.70 --> 00:49:02.58
armac houses communal look let's stick to those subjects not gonna all crazy

636
00:49:05.14 --> 00:49:10.18
all right now this is uh he starts going into a description of what some of the

637
00:49:10.18 --> 00:49:13.94
guys were like has now he spent some time with any he's getting to know them back to the book

638
00:49:14.82 --> 00:49:19.86
I started to get to know my men like most people my age I've been brought up on Hollywood's

639
00:49:19.86 --> 00:49:26.90
idea of a marine platoon a demographically ethnically balanced blend of wasps and the

640
00:49:26.90 --> 00:49:33.38
rest of us you know a Brooklyn jiu street wise but sensitive a big city Italian talking

641
00:49:33.38 --> 00:49:39.14
baseball and making of seam arm gestures behind your back a dumb hayseed farm boy with a

642
00:49:39.14 --> 00:49:44.98
girl back home a heroic black man a Puerto Rican or Mexican with a rosary muddering

643
00:49:44.98 --> 00:49:50.50
Spanish wisdom a feisty little Jimmy Cagni Irishman with a chip on his shoulder a

644
00:49:50.50 --> 00:49:58.66
goulosh of stereotypes the reality in Korea was somewhat different my platoon had no jiu's one

645
00:49:58.66 --> 00:50:05.38
black no Hispanics one Indian certainly and so on there were Protestants and Catholics

646
00:50:05.38 --> 00:50:12.34
and few who are nothing and that was it some Irish some polls some Italians a few French

647
00:50:12.34 --> 00:50:18.66
and the Irish were sober and it was the Midwest roobs who got emotional while the Italians were

648
00:50:18.66 --> 00:50:25.06
being my fodical and flagmatic nor were the battalion officers what the Marine Corps

649
00:50:25.06 --> 00:50:32.02
had traditionally been southern gentlemen now we were easterners Ivy Leagueers college kids

650
00:50:32.02 --> 00:50:39.46
California's Californians men from Detroit and Chicago and Seattle so a little different from what

651
00:50:39.46 --> 00:50:48.82
you might imagine not quite as diverse as they made it out to be in Hollywood now going to a

652
00:50:48.82 --> 00:50:56.18
little more detail about a rifle platoon in the Marine Corps in Korea back to the book a marine rifle

653
00:50:56.18 --> 00:51:00.98
platoon in Korea was a superbly balanced tactical unit with enormous firepower and an

654
00:51:00.98 --> 00:51:10.26
eminently sensible fundamental premise eminently sensible fundamental premise in combat no one man

655
00:51:10.26 --> 00:51:17.70
can reasonably be expected to control directly and effectively more than three other men in a

656
00:51:17.70 --> 00:51:22.58
firefight you can't keep tabs on more than three Marines and still be aware of the enemy

657
00:51:23.62 --> 00:51:28.58
a marine rifle platoon has three squads whose squad leaders are trained to maintain contact with

658
00:51:28.58 --> 00:51:35.22
the platoon leader when he issues orders he issues them not to 40 men but only to these three

659
00:51:35.22 --> 00:51:42.50
sergeants in their turn each control three fire teams each of which is commanded by a corporal

660
00:51:42.50 --> 00:51:51.38
fire team leader they look to the squad leader for their orders he to them for action in the fire

661
00:51:51.38 --> 00:51:58.42
team the corporal has three men whom he controls and who look always to him during a firefight so

662
00:51:58.42 --> 00:52:06.10
this is just a very clear explanation of decentralized command and when you're out on the battlefield

663
00:52:06.10 --> 00:52:14.34
you can't control 30 guys or 60 guys or 20 guys or even 10 and actually he makes a very good point

664
00:52:15.06 --> 00:52:22.34
he says in a firefight you can't keep tabs on more than three Marines and still be aware of the

665
00:52:22.34 --> 00:52:25.38
enemy so maybe if you weren't didn't have to worry about the enemy and what they were doing maybe

666
00:52:25.38 --> 00:52:30.50
then you could handle six or 12 but you gotta worry about what the enemies do and do you're gonna

667
00:52:30.50 --> 00:52:35.54
a lot of other stuff to worry about so you can handle three guys and you see this this happens in

668
00:52:35.54 --> 00:52:41.22
the business world as well where people start to build little worlds where they have where they have

669
00:52:41.22 --> 00:52:47.78
direct reports they have 18 direct reports that's not gonna work that you should not have 18 and

670
00:52:47.78 --> 00:52:58.50
administrative situation I think you can handle 78 maybe you can get to 10 maybe I don't recommend

671
00:52:59.14 --> 00:53:03.14
the fewer direct reports you have and the more you empower and the better off you're gonna be

672
00:53:03.70 --> 00:53:06.74
the more you're gonna be able to look around the more you're gonna be able to see what your competitors are

673
00:53:06.74 --> 00:53:12.98
doing you more time you have to spend on strategy when you have 12 or 16 direct reports you don't

674
00:53:12.98 --> 00:53:17.30
even have time to think because you're in their worlds all day long you're not in your world you're

675
00:53:17.30 --> 00:53:24.34
in 18 different brains that just doesn't work yeah so set yourself up with decentralized command

676
00:53:27.46 --> 00:53:37.46
now we go into back into where they're just on the line and we're about to have a little

677
00:53:37.46 --> 00:53:44.10
bit of action back to the book we were waiting awake Prince and cleaning is M1 rifle like most Marines

678
00:53:44.10 --> 00:53:51.46
then the first grenade exploded followed by a second and a third the phone sounded at my

679
00:53:51.46 --> 00:53:58.34
year it was chaffy the man never slept what if you got up there Brady is that your area where

680
00:53:58.34 --> 00:54:03.86
we're getting grenades yes sir over by the heavy machine gun section I gave him the closest

681
00:54:03.86 --> 00:54:09.94
mortar concentration as I was trained to do then I tried to cool down the affair but there's nothing

682
00:54:09.94 --> 00:54:14.90
else maybe someone's a little shook over there throwing a shadows no firing anywhere whether

683
00:54:14.90 --> 00:54:19.62
not supposed to throw grenades a shadows chaffy tell them to hold their fire until they see something

684
00:54:19.62 --> 00:54:26.82
want me to come up there no sir chaffy asked to be kept informed so chaffy's just saying hey

685
00:54:26.82 --> 00:54:31.06
look get this handled you want me to come up there because by the way I can come up there if need be

686
00:54:31.06 --> 00:54:49.06
no I got it and then the snow comes and when the snow comes it's brutal back to the book even

687
00:54:49.06 --> 00:54:54.34
chaffy was grounded by the snow he held his daily company meeting by telephone transmitting the

688
00:54:54.34 --> 00:54:58.98
password giving a brief account of the fighting elsewhere checking on the conditions of the men

689
00:54:58.98 --> 00:55:06.98
and irregularities in supply there were no patrols but chaffy urged us over and over not to be

690
00:55:06.98 --> 00:55:13.30
old not to relax to be alert when everyone else might nod to scout out the ground each day

691
00:55:13.30 --> 00:55:20.90
whatever the weather to see to it the weapons were clean and lightly oiled oil froze in this cold

692
00:55:20.90 --> 00:55:26.50
you couldn't use much Prince and I alternate visiting the flank of each pertune once a day

693
00:55:26.50 --> 00:55:33.22
in this snow it was easier to duck into the bunkers to talk to inspect weapons to question

694
00:55:33.22 --> 00:55:42.66
the men at the firing ports they brewed cocoa or coffee and I took it so this is something that

695
00:55:42.66 --> 00:55:49.46
we see consistently from chaffy is that he is constantly on his guys to maintain their discipline

696
00:55:49.46 --> 00:55:55.30
right and even when things are going okay he always says hey yeah that's good job on that

697
00:55:55.30 --> 00:56:00.02
guess what let's not get laks and that's exactly what he's doing right here urge us over and over

698
00:56:00.02 --> 00:56:08.98
not to be low not to relax somebody's got to be driving that back to the book a new

699
00:56:08.98 --> 00:56:14.58
tenant had just joined Fox company an enapolis graduate a trade school man a matter of

700
00:56:14.58 --> 00:56:20.98
understandable pride already in the battalion are very own academy graduate he had four years

701
00:56:20.98 --> 00:56:27.38
of anapolis behind him all those parades all that tradition all those army navy games and another

702
00:56:27.38 --> 00:56:32.82
four months at the basics school at quannico fox company was very excited having him it made

703
00:56:32.82 --> 00:56:39.86
everything so official so grand but beyond that he seemed good man a cool and professional young

704
00:56:39.86 --> 00:56:48.10
officer who would do his job his name was folder and his nickname was lucky and he was 22 or 23 years old

705
00:56:48.10 --> 00:56:55.54
when the bar man squeezed off the burst marines came out of every bunker along the fox company

706
00:56:55.54 --> 00:57:02.26
line and on my flank a dozen men with rifles and bars started down the hill after the raiders hoping

707
00:57:02.26 --> 00:57:06.90
they could move faster than the dooks with their prisoners hoping to catch them before they crossed

708
00:57:06.90 --> 00:57:12.98
the river and disappeared into their own minds falter would not yet been out in front of the line

709
00:57:12.98 --> 00:57:18.98
because the five-day rule was one of the first men to reach the grove of trees as he and others ran

710
00:57:18.98 --> 00:57:26.98
through the low pines hurtling over the spring the deep funk of mortars drifted up to us from

711
00:57:26.98 --> 00:57:34.66
across the valley all around falter marines threw themselves flat in the snow pulling helmets

712
00:57:34.66 --> 00:57:39.30
down tight over their ears legs pulled in close cupping their bodies against what they knew

713
00:57:39.30 --> 00:57:46.90
was coming falter had never heard an incoming mortar before one of the first shells hit lucky falter

714
00:57:47.62 --> 00:57:54.34
i'm reading who is nearby said falter made no sound could not have known he was hit no one else was hit

715
00:57:54.90 --> 00:58:06.66
only falter scary thing and i talked about that before on here and being in situations where you

716
00:58:06.66 --> 00:58:13.86
can hear the mortars and obviously you learn what that sounds like and falter hadn't learned it

717
00:58:13.86 --> 00:58:19.22
and didn't know it was like and you know probably no one even thought that you know because i was

718
00:58:19.22 --> 00:58:22.82
thinking about how's this happened no one tells me to get down i'll tell you how that happens

719
00:58:22.82 --> 00:58:26.74
everyone else it's so instinctive at this point they hear it and they get down they're not looking

720
00:58:26.74 --> 00:58:30.58
around they just think everyone knows like oh yeah obviously we got Morris coming no one yells out

721
00:58:30.58 --> 00:58:36.50
in calming they just everyone gets down and he just doesn't know it yet and that lack of knowledge

722
00:58:39.54 --> 00:58:45.14
costume is life and that's why another thing when you're doing turn over with guys overseas

723
00:58:45.14 --> 00:58:50.26
like go into detail on stuff and stuff that you take for granted don't take it for granted

724
00:58:50.26 --> 00:58:56.66
and if you if you think if you're worried about appearing condescending to someone just go ahead

725
00:58:56.66 --> 00:59:00.90
and appear condescending go ahead and go over the details to say look man i don't mean i know you're not

726
00:59:00.90 --> 00:59:05.30
stupid but i'm just gonna go over this just in case you didn't know here's the deal when you hear this

727
00:59:05.30 --> 00:59:16.10
noise funk that means mortars are coming so get down now we get Brady started to do some

728
00:59:16.10 --> 00:59:20.98
patrolling i back to the book i took out the first patrol for dog company Nelson squad it wasn't

729
00:59:20.98 --> 00:59:26.58
required that the patoon lieutenant go out but it was sensible showing you wouldn't send a patrol

730
00:59:26.58 --> 00:59:32.42
where you wouldn't go yourself so common thing you know you if you're sending your guys out

731
00:59:32.42 --> 00:59:36.42
make sure they know that you're going to go out too you're not just sitting back in the bunker

732
00:59:36.42 --> 00:59:41.38
we saw that in patoon leader remember the book and Vietnam where the one patoon leader every day

733
00:59:41.38 --> 00:59:46.02
his patoon's are going out or his squads are going out but he's just staying back there oh hiding

734
00:59:46.02 --> 00:59:56.18
mm-hmm yeah don't be that guy moving forward a little bit back to the book i lost two more

735
00:59:56.18 --> 01:00:01.78
men one of them danker had a fire team in the third squad danker was one of the men wounded

736
01:00:01.78 --> 01:00:06.74
its September on 749 that's a hill bit they found a big battle 7 hill 749 you're going to hear

737
01:00:06.74 --> 01:00:13.22
about that Brady wasn't on it put some of a lot of his veterans were his wounds were cured

738
01:00:13.22 --> 01:00:19.38
but he was only a month away from rotation and he was shook that's what they called combat fatigue

739
01:00:19.38 --> 01:00:23.94
danger danger did everything he was told to do but he was afraid he begged prince and to do

740
01:00:23.94 --> 01:00:29.30
something then when a chaffee's runners broke a leg on the ice steps and i sent danker to the

741
01:00:29.30 --> 01:00:35.22
cp is a runner he came to thank me lieutenant i haven't searched you but if i have to go out

742
01:00:35.22 --> 01:00:40.74
in another ambush i'm scared i'll do something bad and get people hurt i don't know i just can't

743
01:00:40.74 --> 01:00:46.90
know more control the way i am the way i feel i used to be a good man he began to cry

744
01:00:47.54 --> 01:00:52.42
and i turned away and told prince to get him settled up that the captain was waiting so

745
01:00:52.42 --> 01:00:59.86
we're starting to see some some psychological impact on the guys and i think i think that

746
01:00:59.86 --> 01:01:03.70
Brady handles this perfectly very similar to the way dick winners would handle it oh we got a guy

747
01:01:03.70 --> 01:01:08.34
that started losing a little bit get him off the line give him a break give him a rest and the

748
01:01:08.34 --> 01:01:12.98
big thing that winners points out dick winners i'm talking band of brothers first the five o'clock

749
01:01:12.98 --> 01:01:18.58
one of the things that he put points out is if you get the guy off the line they they'd come back

750
01:01:18.58 --> 01:01:25.46
they'll be okay if you don't and you grind them out it's like having an engine that's low on oil

751
01:01:25.46 --> 01:01:30.02
if you get it to the service station they'll just put more oil in there come back it's going to

752
01:01:30.02 --> 01:01:34.66
it's going to be fine if you keep driving that thing dry on oil it's going to be destroyed

753
01:01:34.66 --> 01:01:38.42
and that's the same thing that can happen with with people with people's minds

754
01:01:41.30 --> 01:01:45.94
you know see some more minds get start to become affected by this back to the book

755
01:01:45.94 --> 01:01:51.70
Kelso the machine gunner lost a man it wasn't the gooks that did it but the wind

756
01:01:51.70 --> 01:01:57.06
we'd been on the line three weeks and the wind never stopped one night Kelso's corporal went

757
01:01:57.06 --> 01:02:02.66
berserk firing off a heavy machine gun inside the bunker trying to kill rats that no one else saw

758
01:02:02.66 --> 01:02:09.06
they carried him off in the morning cursing the wind and the rats jooling and trying to tear off his

759
01:02:09.06 --> 01:02:15.06
clothes prints and looked at him foughtfully i was shaken by the sounds coming from a good

760
01:02:15.06 --> 01:02:23.46
marine a solid nco so again both these guys danker and this this guy right here they're good marines

761
01:02:24.50 --> 01:02:29.86
that just couldn't they just got they just had enough and they need to get off the line they need to

762
01:02:29.86 --> 01:02:41.06
break back to the book we lost other men only fits Gerald squad did not lose anyone

763
01:02:41.78 --> 01:02:47.06
fits would not permit himself to be evacuated the morning i trip the mind and he would not

764
01:02:47.06 --> 01:02:54.98
permit his men to quit he was tough but he was more than that he was the best we had and his

765
01:02:54.98 --> 01:03:03.06
men knew it and they refused to weaken even when weakness closed in on them fits Gerald drove them

766
01:03:03.06 --> 01:03:10.34
and they drove themselves that's such a great indicator of what leadership is all these other people

767
01:03:10.34 --> 01:03:15.06
losing people people are going crazy they're they're they're combat fatigue they're being overcome

768
01:03:16.58 --> 01:03:22.90
fits Gerald is a leader and he holds the line and that makes his guys hold the line

769
01:03:22.90 --> 01:03:31.14
and it says you know it's he was tough but he was more than that it's not just about being tough

770
01:03:31.14 --> 01:03:40.66
being tough only gets you a part of the way there yeah this is uh this next loss of men is just

771
01:03:40.66 --> 01:03:48.42
awful back to the book back Allen lost men his patoon sergeant took out a typical patrol

772
01:03:48.42 --> 01:03:54.10
terrible cold but no fighting they came back in about two a.m. using a fixed rope that to help

773
01:03:54.10 --> 01:04:00.10
them scramble up nearly sheer ice below the wire came in half frozen and tired

774
01:04:01.06 --> 01:04:05.78
mac was there to meet them to check in each man as he questioned the patoon sergeant about the

775
01:04:05.78 --> 01:04:12.74
patrol the sergeant remembered damn me mister Allen we left the rope out there hanging down

776
01:04:12.74 --> 01:04:18.74
from just below the wire the sergeant yelled for another marine to give him a hand and disappeared

777
01:04:18.74 --> 01:04:25.78
over the lip of the ridge with a husky blonde marine in tow mac was back in the bunker taking off his

778
01:04:25.78 --> 01:04:32.02
boots when a burst of machine gun fire then another ripped through the mountain stillness

779
01:04:32.82 --> 01:04:38.66
outside marines were running mac pulled on the boots and crawled out grabbing a man running by

780
01:04:38.66 --> 01:04:44.26
where's the patoon sergeant where's the sergeant and wind gate in the confusion it took a few

781
01:04:44.26 --> 01:04:51.38
minutes to find them they both lay dead on the forward slope big wind gate draped over the wire

782
01:04:51.38 --> 01:04:58.26
the sergeant curled up looking like a man taking a nap on a red and patch of snow one of Allen's

783
01:04:58.26 --> 01:05:03.46
machine gunners knew the patrol was in but no one had fought to tell him about the two men

784
01:05:03.46 --> 01:05:10.82
going back out to retrieve the rope as they came back he took them for gooks trailing the patrol home

785
01:05:10.82 --> 01:05:19.46
trying for a straggler and he fired off two short effective bursts he was a very good gunner

786
01:05:19.46 --> 01:05:25.38
and he caught both men in the face the rope was coiled neatly over the sergeant's shoulder

787
01:05:25.38 --> 01:05:32.66
wind gate was in my machine gun patoon on 749 before being transferred to max patoon not

788
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:40.34
a terribly good marine a brooder most men disliked him one of the few friends he had was the gunner

789
01:05:40.34 --> 01:05:47.38
who killed him knowing what losing sergeant and wind gate would mean to mac I called him on

790
01:05:47.38 --> 01:05:53.06
the company phone to talk about it he wondered if he should have just left the dam rope out there dangling

791
01:05:53.06 --> 01:05:58.58
no matter that the sergeant should have passed word that they were going back out this was max patoon

792
01:05:58.58 --> 01:06:07.62
and these his men and their deaths his deaths it carried the body to the supply tent just

793
01:06:07.62 --> 01:06:12.82
below the company cp and laid them out the cold would take care of them through the night and in

794
01:06:12.82 --> 01:06:18.74
the morning the gook train would come through but when the gooks got there and ate stretcher bears

795
01:06:18.74 --> 01:06:23.86
fell out to approach the supply plant tent to pick up the dead and carry them down the hill

796
01:06:23.86 --> 01:06:30.42
a marine stopped them the gunner who'd killed wind gate and the sergeant he had sat crying all

797
01:06:30.42 --> 01:06:36.90
might in the tent sitting over the bodies and now he stood just outside the tent flap dry eyed

798
01:06:36.90 --> 01:06:44.10
but holding a 45 automatic you're not taking them he said the gooks dropped the two stretchers and

799
01:06:44.10 --> 01:06:51.14
scattered along the path and both directions crazy marines the stretcher lay on the ice

800
01:06:51.86 --> 01:06:57.30
chaffy walked up to the gunner give it here corporal he said you know wind gate wouldn't want you

801
01:06:57.30 --> 01:07:03.38
doing that stay back skipper the corporal said he waved the gun crying again now and shaking his head

802
01:07:04.18 --> 01:07:09.62
I was down there by now with all the excitement and to me it was pretty clear a fast man

803
01:07:09.62 --> 01:07:16.10
standing this close could jump and a new chaffy was very fast but the captain just stood there

804
01:07:16.10 --> 01:07:24.42
easily hands on his hips fill he said fill you know Johnny wouldn't want anyone hurt over him

805
01:07:26.10 --> 01:07:31.30
the corporal didn't move for an instant and then he shook his head and his right arm flexed

806
01:07:31.70 --> 01:07:37.30
then fell the pistol hanging loose in his hand chaffy reached out to take it

807
01:07:37.30 --> 01:07:42.26
then he did something I would not have done he slipped the 45 back into the corporal's

808
01:07:42.26 --> 01:07:46.26
holster patting him on the shoulder and waved the gooks to come to the tent

809
01:07:47.54 --> 01:07:53.70
then chaffy and fillups and eye with the corporal's help lay the two bodies very gently on the

810
01:07:53.70 --> 01:08:00.66
stretchers they were frozen solid and handled like cordwood the corporal sat in the snow crying

811
01:08:00.66 --> 01:08:04.82
until red fillups got him to drink some coffee and go back to his bunker

812
01:08:04.82 --> 01:08:10.98
I realized it was the first time I'd heard chaffy call a marine by his Christian name

813
01:08:14.98 --> 01:08:20.74
so this blue on blue and I seem to hit this in every book that we we talk about it for some reason

814
01:08:20.74 --> 01:08:26.58
it's something that doesn't get taught very often it didn't get taught to me in great detail

815
01:08:26.58 --> 01:08:32.82
the detail I wish it got taught in something that happens happens as simple as this I

816
01:08:32.82 --> 01:08:36.10
always got the rope we're going to go back out and grab it and then you got two dead marines

817
01:08:36.10 --> 01:08:42.58
killed by another marine I mean it's just an awful situation so don't ever take any part of an

818
01:08:42.58 --> 01:08:48.02
operation lightly ever and make sure you keep people informed of where you're going to be on the

819
01:08:48.02 --> 01:08:52.66
battlefield and there's nothing harder when you're when you're leaving the lines you got to let

820
01:08:52.66 --> 01:08:58.34
people know don't take it for granted that people understand what's going on so these are kind of

821
01:08:58.34 --> 01:09:03.78
things that are happening back to the book so the gooks were not the only danger we were killing

822
01:09:03.78 --> 01:09:09.14
ourselves and breaking our legs and falling sick and cracking up and being carried away

823
01:09:11.06 --> 01:09:16.82
it was how it was in a mountain of war and deep winter but the gooks were to have their chances

824
01:09:16.82 --> 01:09:30.90
both Mac Allen and I had lost men and now it came Simonis's turn so Simonis is the guy that

825
01:09:31.46 --> 01:09:35.54
I'd said I had done a big operation it was pretty successful hadn't taken a gas leaves

826
01:09:35.54 --> 01:09:42.74
and killed a bunch of enemy and now we're about to do any encounter with him some things are going

827
01:09:42.74 --> 01:09:48.90
sideways for him back to the book I heard the firing before I was really awake part reality part night

828
01:09:48.90 --> 01:09:55.78
mare I sat up suddenly in the bag Prince and was up and dressed and he handed me a canteen cup

829
01:09:55.78 --> 01:10:00.82
hot with coffee very strong and black the way he made it Prince went on fussing with domestic

830
01:10:00.82 --> 01:10:06.58
chores keeping a tidy bunker Mr. Simonis is catching it he said Simonis had taken a patrol

831
01:10:06.58 --> 01:10:11.22
down the mountain the night before and ambitious affair affair all the way into the valley

832
01:10:11.22 --> 01:10:16.82
he should have been back and into the line by this time it was almost six I tried to call the

833
01:10:16.82 --> 01:10:22.82
CP but nobody answered they must all be out trying to do something about Simonis then I remembered

834
01:10:22.82 --> 01:10:30.10
that Chaffey wasn't there he torn his hand helping men lay barbed wire it had become infected

835
01:10:30.10 --> 01:10:35.30
and he was down at the battalion getting it repaired Chaffey had no business out there musseling

836
01:10:35.30 --> 01:10:42.10
wire but tried telling Chaffey not to do things so there's Chaffey's not around the square

837
01:10:42.10 --> 01:10:46.98
away company commander's not around so it's actually fill ups that's running the company right

838
01:10:46.98 --> 01:10:52.10
now and you got Simonis supposed to be back in the wire but he's not he stuck out in the in the

839
01:10:52.10 --> 01:10:58.50
field and Simonis had had radio contact and he'd been caught out there at first light as they

840
01:10:58.50 --> 01:11:07.06
went across a little stream and they got mortar they got hit and so finally Brady goes and

841
01:11:07.06 --> 01:11:13.86
and gets to fill ups and talks to him fill ups just back to the book fell was standing in front

842
01:11:13.86 --> 01:11:18.18
of the CP looking saw him look red I'll take some people down there if you want with

843
01:11:18.18 --> 01:11:22.10
stretchers and help Simonis get out of there fill ups looked at me for the first time and

844
01:11:22.10 --> 01:11:28.18
in what seemed to be focus yeah yeah he said that's a good idea I sent a fire team down already

845
01:11:28.18 --> 01:11:33.46
with a corpsman and some blood but they're gonna need more than that good idea get a squad of

846
01:11:33.46 --> 01:11:41.94
people together I appreciate this get them back I appreciate it they came to me he was afraid maybe

847
01:11:41.94 --> 01:11:52.74
they wouldn't be back and so Brady gathers up his troops and they take off he says he's feeling

848
01:11:52.74 --> 01:11:59.94
afraid but he's going anyways and they take off down the hill and it's it's a long distance but

849
01:11:59.94 --> 01:12:03.38
they get make it up very quickly because they're traveling light and they're heading downhill

850
01:12:03.38 --> 01:12:07.62
which is pretty easy no it's obviously easier than going uphill back the book I was at the bottom

851
01:12:07.62 --> 01:12:14.18
before I expected a dozen or more marines lay around in the snow some under pines under some pines

852
01:12:14.18 --> 01:12:20.82
at the edge of flat ground there were two dead Simonis told me and seven wounded out of 12

853
01:12:20.82 --> 01:12:26.90
only one of the wounded was really bad and he might not make it the others were walking wounded

854
01:12:27.62 --> 01:12:33.22
it was the mortars that caught them in the open ground at first light they must have had the

855
01:12:33.22 --> 01:12:38.66
concentration registered he said because there were no ranging shots just silence one moment

856
01:12:38.66 --> 01:12:45.46
and shells were wearing the next there was no firing at all from either side so one thing that

857
01:12:45.46 --> 01:12:51.54
one thing about mortars is first of all they're hard to shoot accurately and we talk about

858
01:12:51.54 --> 01:12:56.66
ranging what you do is you shoot one if you try to hit a target you shoot the first one long

859
01:12:56.66 --> 01:13:00.82
and then you shoot the second one short and then you take the two the compromise and two in the

860
01:13:00.82 --> 01:13:04.98
middle and then you're going to hit your target so that's that's how mortars work so what they have

861
01:13:04.98 --> 01:13:08.74
in this situation when he said that they must have had the mortars registered that means they already

862
01:13:08.74 --> 01:13:12.34
have and they know that spot and they don't have to range them at all they can just drop them and

863
01:13:12.34 --> 01:13:17.54
the other thing that so mortars they can just you don't always hear that sound of them being launched

864
01:13:17.54 --> 01:13:22.02
especially if it's further away you're not going to hear that or different atmosphere occurred

865
01:13:22.02 --> 01:13:27.70
noise conditions you know if you've got heavy cloud cover that reflects the noises but if you

866
01:13:27.70 --> 01:13:32.34
don't maybe you don't hear it maybe different terrain doesn't let you hear noises just like noises

867
01:13:32.34 --> 01:13:37.86
reflecting around in a city and the other thing about mortars that is is hard to understand

868
01:13:37.86 --> 01:13:43.14
mortars coming all different shapes and sizes and small mortars are tiny they're tiny little 60

869
01:13:43.14 --> 01:13:47.86
millimeter mortars they're tiny and I mean it's six centimeters right that's how big it is they're

870
01:13:47.86 --> 01:13:53.22
tiny little things and then it goes all the way up to 120 millimeter and now they go bigger than

871
01:13:53.22 --> 01:14:02.02
that but the common is you know as big as 120 millimeters yeah yeah it's big yeah and so

872
01:14:02.02 --> 01:14:09.54
what you end up with the main point of this is that these things when mortars hit the shards

873
01:14:09.54 --> 01:14:15.14
the the the shrapnel that comes off them people think of shrapnel is being little tiny things

874
01:14:15.14 --> 01:14:21.14
and I've talked about this before shrapnel is big shrapnel is giant shrapnel can be eight

875
01:14:21.14 --> 01:14:27.06
to ten inches long I mean just giant and they're thick shrapnel can is a half inch piece of steel

876
01:14:27.06 --> 01:14:33.30
just a big chunk a half inch piece of steel it's brutal and so when it hits them in these guys

877
01:14:34.58 --> 01:14:41.38
totally unexpected there's walking and boom it's it's devastating but the shooting it stopped

878
01:14:43.14 --> 01:14:48.58
back to the book they had stretchers out and rolled the bodies aboard strapping them on with their own

879
01:14:48.58 --> 01:14:55.14
belts and then four men lifted coffee and slid or stretcher under him so coffee will this a big giant guy

880
01:14:55.14 --> 01:15:02.82
they said he's over six six just a monster of a guy God knows what he weighs but he's huge

881
01:15:03.86 --> 01:15:08.18
and so they got a carry him and like I mentioned that they were running downhill to get to him

882
01:15:08.18 --> 01:15:13.86
well now to get back they got to go uphill the whole way we heaved him up and started off

883
01:15:13.86 --> 01:15:20.18
up the trotting snow slowly as it had to be with his weight on the hill the hill reached

884
01:15:20.18 --> 01:15:27.70
endlessly upward so they are trudging and it doesn't take long for them to be like exhausted

885
01:15:29.38 --> 01:15:34.66
back to the book the other three men looked as bad as I felt we were all tired the four of us and

886
01:15:34.66 --> 01:15:39.22
among us there wasn't a damn shred of sympathy anymore for coffee the cause of our exhaustion of

887
01:15:39.22 --> 01:15:46.26
our misery we all hated poor coffee old when I realized this some pride seemed to back into me

888
01:15:46.26 --> 01:15:52.66
we were all in the same fix I didn't want to be the first to give up but if I didn't give up soon

889
01:15:52.66 --> 01:15:58.50
I would die there with coffee old there in the snow broken by the impossible load we carried

890
01:15:59.14 --> 01:16:05.86
I was climbing now with my eyes shut not wanting to see how much hill remained my mouth wide open

891
01:16:05.86 --> 01:16:12.58
and gasping we all fell again the third time like Christ under the cross this time I didn't

892
01:16:12.58 --> 01:16:18.58
get to my feet but crouch there gulping air around me the others were still down then

893
01:16:18.58 --> 01:16:23.78
Simone is at my side time to change over we'll take him for a stretch so this is just a brutal

894
01:16:23.78 --> 01:16:31.78
physical evolution that's happening I was back to the book I was thirsty but my canteen was frozen

895
01:16:31.78 --> 01:16:37.06
solid Princeton was always warning me about that but I hadn't wanted to add whiskey the way

896
01:16:37.06 --> 01:16:43.70
Princeton I regretted it now and scooped up smooth snow from just off the trail and let it melt in my mouth

897
01:16:45.22 --> 01:16:50.98
so imagine that you're just devastatingly thirsty and boom you go to get your drink your canteen

898
01:16:50.98 --> 01:17:01.78
it's frozen completely solid brutal now they continue I mean it's it's it's just a heinous

899
01:17:01.78 --> 01:17:08.18
evolution that they go through they finally get him back up back to the book the climb was over

900
01:17:08.18 --> 01:17:17.62
13 hours after it began over for today tomorrow could be the same or worse it really wasn't

901
01:17:17.62 --> 01:17:23.86
fair that having done so much there was still so much to do you never really mastered war never

902
01:17:23.86 --> 01:17:35.70
got on top of it it was always too big there was too much to it ever to finish the job now

903
01:17:39.38 --> 01:17:45.94
it goes from that just brutal situation I mean imagine 13 13 hours but you think it's you think

904
01:17:45.94 --> 01:17:49.86
you're gonna be back in like 45 minutes right hand run out we'll help these guys we'll get some

905
01:17:49.86 --> 01:17:57.86
stretchers and then you you run down there it's 13 hours later your dehydrated but he starts to go into

906
01:17:57.86 --> 01:18:04.26
some reflections now of what it was like some other parts of the war and you're gonna see he's

907
01:18:04.26 --> 01:18:08.26
gonna oscillate back and forth as he describes some of the stuff but it's all really good

908
01:18:08.26 --> 01:18:15.78
information and things to think about back to the book when you weren't fighting the war was pretty good

909
01:18:15.78 --> 01:18:22.74
mornings were the best time the terror of the night ended the patrols and ambushes and duck

910
01:18:22.74 --> 01:18:30.34
blinds men slept late when there was snow it in the night it lay smooth and on track no industrial

911
01:18:30.34 --> 01:18:38.34
smokestack or city set turning it down or in gray no vehicles to turn it into slush it hung

912
01:18:38.34 --> 01:18:44.74
glistening on the pine branches until the sun warming as it rose thawed it into tiny shining

913
01:18:44.74 --> 01:18:51.62
icicles glistening melting drop drop men crawled out of their bunkers into the morning calm

914
01:18:51.62 --> 01:19:00.10
the industrious using entrenching tools to dig away the snow tidying the trench so there's

915
01:19:00.90 --> 01:19:06.10
that's the dichotomy of war and he's gonna go back and forth on this dichotomy quite a bit

916
01:19:06.10 --> 01:19:15.22
do you know I mean guarantee you experience that to where overall it's just this really junk

917
01:19:15.22 --> 01:19:20.82
situation overall but then all those little almost like micro pleasures you know how it's

918
01:19:20.82 --> 01:19:25.22
this little thing they kind of add up and then you kind of miss them yeah it's interesting

919
01:19:25.22 --> 01:19:30.50
that never even mind micro that's one of the reasons I'm in this chapter you're gonna see like

920
01:19:30.50 --> 01:19:36.82
he's talking it goes back and forth about what makes it good and what makes it fun and there's

921
01:19:36.82 --> 01:19:42.50
something and I've talked about the story there's something so pure about being overseas fighting

922
01:19:42.50 --> 01:19:46.34
a war you know to think about anything else yeah you like you don't think about anything else

923
01:19:46.34 --> 01:19:51.70
and just this pure thing that you have then nothing else in the world matters and that feels good

924
01:19:52.42 --> 01:19:58.18
I love that feeling yeah even like what if you think packed you tear I don't know

925
01:19:58.18 --> 01:20:03.94
so certain some people they're like oh yeah my college days where I was oh so broke there's all this

926
01:20:03.94 --> 01:20:09.46
like junk stuff and how much better it is now but you think back on just the the small good

927
01:20:09.46 --> 01:20:13.86
parts you know like yeah well you definitely everybody everybody self edits their past and

928
01:20:13.86 --> 01:20:18.10
remembers the good stuff more than the bad yeah right I mean that definitely happens yeah if I

929
01:20:18.10 --> 01:20:22.26
didn't happen you know I've heard said if that didn't happen women would never have more than one

930
01:20:22.26 --> 01:20:27.78
kid right because it doesn't give in birth this is like a really tough evolution so I don't

931
01:20:27.78 --> 01:20:32.18
want to do that again but the reality is women have all kinds of kids despite the toughness of

932
01:20:32.18 --> 01:20:36.98
that evolution because they were not with the good stuff yeah especially I mean sometimes if they if they

933
01:20:36.98 --> 01:20:44.10
kind of leave that experience with a bad idea of it then then they'll self edit the other way

934
01:20:44.10 --> 01:20:49.78
like all it was just junk but you know those times when it's like we always kind of miss those times

935
01:20:49.78 --> 01:20:53.46
well to say there's all kinds of when you're on deployment there's all kinds of frustrations

936
01:20:53.46 --> 01:20:58.50
and and there's infighting and there's all these problems and then you get back for and everyone hates

937
01:20:58.50 --> 01:21:03.70
each other you get back everyone's like oh yeah yeah you said all that stuff is out yeah yeah

938
01:21:03.70 --> 01:21:10.34
when you think when you go on deployment if you make it back and you know and get back it's like

939
01:21:10.34 --> 01:21:14.82
you know you've done a good thing you know to go fight for your country is a good thing straight up so

940
01:21:14.82 --> 01:21:20.98
you know that seed it's pretty rare you're gonna emerge thinking oh man we shouldn't have done that kind

941
01:21:20.98 --> 01:21:26.82
of thing yeah no that's definitely not a few of them overall you know overall so that's one of

942
01:21:26.82 --> 01:21:30.82
those things where yeah it's the way you're gonna self edit it's gonna be in the good way you know

943
01:21:30.82 --> 01:21:34.98
so you're gonna be oh I miss all that miss that time even though it was miserable and I think

944
01:21:34.98 --> 01:21:38.74
what's cool is I think you're gonna see here this here he goes back and forth like he's definitely

945
01:21:38.74 --> 01:21:43.22
self editing some of the good stuff but he's also going right into some of the his description

946
01:21:43.22 --> 01:21:46.34
and we'll get to it here in a minute I think it's I think it's in this section but he's talking

947
01:21:46.34 --> 01:21:53.14
about like when the night comes and it's awesome we'll get there in a minute back to the book

948
01:21:53.14 --> 01:21:59.14
Princeton like most regulars made a fetish of shaving daily water was always short we melted snow

949
01:21:59.14 --> 01:22:05.54
and can't teen cups over Coleman stoves and parceled out from five gallon Jerry cans

950
01:22:06.58 --> 01:22:12.98
water maybe is the heaviest thing Marines ever have to carry we never washed there wasn't water

951
01:22:12.98 --> 01:22:18.26
for that I suppose we smelled pretty bad but you stopped noticing the air and the bunkers

952
01:22:18.26 --> 01:22:24.02
lighted by candles and warm by Coleman stoves was so foul that you spit suck and body

953
01:22:24.02 --> 01:22:30.26
oomer odor didn't really register you never changed clothes except for socks I had two pairs of

954
01:22:30.26 --> 01:22:36.58
heavy wool socks and I tried to change every day the socks you put on were filthy but after 24 hours

955
01:22:36.58 --> 01:22:43.94
they were dry the sweat evaporated frozen feet were continual fear we all knew the horror stories

956
01:22:43.94 --> 01:22:49.94
from the winter before many lost toes or an entire foot sometimes both feet if you could somehow

957
01:22:49.94 --> 01:22:56.18
keep your feet dry the cold wasn't as dangerous you might if the Koreans didn't get you or a mine

958
01:22:56.18 --> 01:23:02.26
or an accidental discharge or a short round survived the winter with limbs intact how the socks

959
01:23:02.26 --> 01:23:06.26
smelled didn't matter only if they were dry and there's a part there's a part of the book that I

960
01:23:06.26 --> 01:23:12.34
didn't talk about that I didn't highlight at least I don't think I did but they're they're showing

961
01:23:12.34 --> 01:23:17.14
them a film to get ready to go to Korea and the film is of a guy with frost bitten toes

962
01:23:17.78 --> 01:23:23.94
and the surgeon he's not even using a knife he's just the toes are just they're just coming off

963
01:23:23.94 --> 01:23:29.06
like breaking off a toe like breaking off a toy off a branch and you know that kind of thing right

964
01:23:29.06 --> 01:23:35.86
there we'll make a try and keep your feet dry back to the book if I had one I smoked a

965
01:23:35.86 --> 01:23:42.18
cigar chewing the stub into pulp spitting juice onto the snow at my feet onto my thermal boots it

966
01:23:42.18 --> 01:23:47.06
didn't matter which there were no inspections up here none of the garrison chicken shit you

967
01:23:47.06 --> 01:23:54.50
lived with a quannico or penultin or even in reserve these were good times too afternoons looking

968
01:23:54.50 --> 01:24:00.66
at the mountains in the snow and smoking and spitting with knowing to complain scratching yourself where

969
01:24:00.66 --> 01:24:06.50
you witched your groin or your belly or wherever you're in a country this lovely unless you

970
01:24:06.50 --> 01:24:11.38
are someone was shooting at you or sending you out on patrol if you could stay warm and dry

971
01:24:11.38 --> 01:24:17.78
and you knew there was a one more can of sweet peaches or pairs back in the bunker the war

972
01:24:17.78 --> 01:24:24.34
wasn't so bad so that's awesome that's what I'm talking about you're over there there's no

973
01:24:24.34 --> 01:24:27.78
it's weird because there's all kinds of rules when you're in combat but they're different rules

974
01:24:27.78 --> 01:24:31.94
and the the rules of normal life they don't apply anymore and you just do whatever you want

975
01:24:31.94 --> 01:24:35.78
they don't have a case is you know oh this is an orc as smash it oh I don't like this

976
01:24:35.78 --> 01:24:41.30
gonna break it oh there's something over there shoot at it it's fun it's awesome and then

977
01:24:43.22 --> 01:24:47.22
yeah and then like you know he's literally talking about you know just scratching yourself like

978
01:24:47.22 --> 01:24:52.18
you're just it's just man's world right I mean at least it was for me just a bunch of guys

979
01:24:52.18 --> 01:24:59.62
hanging out with a cool job and so it's awesome it's fun now things you're gonna see this is

980
01:24:59.62 --> 01:25:08.02
that this is that paragraph that I was talking about it's awesome then by 230 or 2405 in the

981
01:25:08.02 --> 01:25:13.78
afternoon the sun would start to fall toward the ridge line and the wind out of Siberia would pick

982
01:25:13.78 --> 01:25:21.30
up and I would begin to shiver not just from the cold but knowing that the good time was nearing

983
01:25:21.30 --> 01:25:28.18
its end that darkness was coming the dark and the night and the terrible cold and unless we were

984
01:25:28.18 --> 01:25:36.90
lucky the fighting I hated to see the dusk come in combat there are no beautiful sunsets

985
01:25:36.90 --> 01:25:44.10
a falling sun is a warning of the night the shadows lengthen and the temperature falls and the wind

986
01:25:44.10 --> 01:25:51.38
seeks you out men begin to move around now restless nervey bizzing themselves with chores to take

987
01:25:51.38 --> 01:25:55.86
their minds off the night breaking down weapons one more time for cleaning rearranging their

988
01:25:55.86 --> 01:26:00.66
grenades and bringing in the sleeping bags left out for a day's airing heating a supper of

989
01:26:00.66 --> 01:26:08.02
lime of beans and ham before dark once the night comes there may not be time once the darkness falls

990
01:26:08.02 --> 01:26:16.34
the good times are passed the pleasant indolence the contemplation of the day is gone by 430 there

991
01:26:16.34 --> 01:26:23.70
is no more sun and then only a swift dusk and then the real night cold and frightening and too

992
01:26:23.70 --> 01:26:35.30
often deadly yeah I was this is something else to think about this is like a daily reminder to me

993
01:26:35.30 --> 01:26:40.82
because I was I was watching sunset if I have the opportunity yeah but like I reread this book

994
01:26:40.82 --> 01:26:45.38
for the podcast and so lately now when I'm watching the sunset this is what I'm thinking about

995
01:26:45.38 --> 01:26:49.78
about what these guys were thinking it's all nice and pretty here in California wants to sunset

996
01:26:49.78 --> 01:26:55.14
it's not always like that do you think that that kind of robbs you of the experience here or do

997
01:26:55.14 --> 01:26:59.38
you think it adds to I think it adds to it a hundred percent because I'm not sitting I don't I'm not in this

998
01:26:59.38 --> 01:27:05.94
reality I'm not in their their reality I'm in my reality sunset means look looks nice the wind calms down

999
01:27:05.94 --> 01:27:11.62
you get to see a beautiful sky that's what sunset is but I get to contrast that with what these

1000
01:27:11.62 --> 01:27:16.42
guys experience with the true darkness coming and what that meant to them the fear that they were

1001
01:27:16.42 --> 01:27:22.82
going to face every single night and it's amazing that every single day they wake up and enjoy that

1002
01:27:22.82 --> 01:27:29.70
day they enjoy that icicles dripping water and they would relish that even with the imminent

1003
01:27:29.70 --> 01:27:34.82
darkness coming they relished what they could and I think that's a good lesson for anybody to learn

1004
01:27:34.82 --> 01:27:41.54
yeah yeah that's what I'm saying if you can manage to do that you know not only do the

1005
01:27:41.54 --> 01:27:46.10
keep things in perspective but it'll enhance your experience you know exactly you got to know the

1006
01:27:46.10 --> 01:27:55.94
darkness back to the book if you've never been to war and this is going back to us oscillating

1007
01:27:55.94 --> 01:28:02.58
a little bit in the other direction about the good times if you've never been to war you cannot

1008
01:28:02.58 --> 01:28:10.10
realize that some of it not all of it of course but some of it is such sheer boyish fun you

1009
01:28:10.10 --> 01:28:16.50
lived outdoors you are physically active you shared the boisterous camaraderie of other young men you

1010
01:28:16.50 --> 01:28:23.22
shed fat and put on sinew and muscle except for those nagging minor hurts you were clear eyed

1011
01:28:23.22 --> 01:28:28.58
in generally healthy and your body responded instantly and instinctively whenever called upon

1012
01:28:29.46 --> 01:28:34.82
you slept like the dead not even the domain you of the ration box killed appetite

1013
01:28:34.82 --> 01:28:41.22
you saw the dawn and the night and the stars and came to calculate time and date by the phases

1014
01:28:41.22 --> 01:28:47.54
of the moon and on those rare days of fall you heard the gurgle of running water under the snow

1015
01:28:47.54 --> 01:28:53.38
heading toward the valley in the sea you smelled the pines and listened to the wind and you could

1016
01:28:53.38 --> 01:28:59.38
sense when the snow was coming and new to the instant when the sun would rise when the sun would set

1017
01:28:59.38 --> 01:29:07.30
a city boy I was falling in love with the country those first months in the hills if only

1018
01:29:07.30 --> 01:29:17.70
I could get home to tell about it I hoped I would live until spring so that's the other side of it

1019
01:29:17.70 --> 01:29:23.30
and that's I completely agree with it you're you're you're you're so focused and you're

1020
01:29:23.30 --> 01:29:26.58
with your guys and there's nothing else to worry about and you're all working towards common

1021
01:29:26.58 --> 01:29:36.18
going it's awesome that's just the dichotomy of war moving on back to the book you learned

1022
01:29:36.18 --> 01:29:43.14
from men like chaffy a yaly with a wall law degree from Harvard who came from money a handsome

1023
01:29:43.94 --> 01:29:51.78
man physically courageous and tireless from all that could have come arrogance snobbery

1024
01:29:51.78 --> 01:30:00.50
but possessed he possessed neither of those traits he was only calm and vigorous and efficient

1025
01:30:00.50 --> 01:30:07.14
usually cheerful decent and humane a good man a fine officer and you learned from men like

1026
01:30:07.14 --> 01:30:14.98
corporate geese who might heard one day expounding on what was wrong with war movies you notice

1027
01:30:14.98 --> 01:30:21.78
in the movies geese said marines never shit john wane or none of them they never have to take a

1028
01:30:21.78 --> 01:30:25.62
crap never how can you believe the rest of a movie where no one ever takes a shit

1029
01:30:29.62 --> 01:30:34.66
I have to agree with that and actually if you read this book he goes into some details about

1030
01:30:34.66 --> 01:30:38.90
that that are that are really good just some of the minute details things like shitting

1031
01:30:38.90 --> 01:30:45.46
yeah that that are really there hilarious to read it's it's great stuff and it's and again

1032
01:30:45.46 --> 01:30:51.06
it's the kind of details that those are the they part of the life yeah you know it's like in

1033
01:30:51.06 --> 01:30:59.78
an iraq you you basically are always shooting in these little portabodies portabodas portabodas right

1034
01:31:00.42 --> 01:31:06.10
and so there's a whole like they're in the summertime they're like solanus we call them solanus

1035
01:31:06.10 --> 01:31:10.90
blue stonus because it will blue and there's flies in the middle it becomes its own little thing

1036
01:31:10.90 --> 01:31:16.10
right and then it's gonna talk about that I mean I guess I just did but that's that's a big

1037
01:31:16.10 --> 01:31:21.30
like when I go when I'm at an at a event somewhere and I got a you want to talk about flashbacks

1038
01:31:21.30 --> 01:31:25.30
you put me into a portabodas somewhere and it's hot I'm thinking I'm an Iraqi means to me

1039
01:31:25.30 --> 01:31:29.22
and there's flies and it's just horrible that's the way it is that's one of the little

1040
01:31:29.22 --> 01:31:32.66
things and he definitely goes into some great details in this book about all all kinds of stuff

1041
01:31:32.66 --> 01:31:37.78
yeah that we don't really think about well another thing that was interesting is he talks

1042
01:31:37.78 --> 01:31:43.46
about he talked about the ways his canteen's being frozen but back to the book in this cold dry

1043
01:31:43.46 --> 01:31:50.66
air your throat was always parched your canteen might be frozen and you longed for drink I vowed

1044
01:31:50.66 --> 01:31:57.54
once the war was over never again to pass a faucet without pausing to slake my thirst with a glass of

1045
01:31:57.54 --> 01:32:05.30
cold water you don't think about these guys being thirsty but they were absolutely now we get into

1046
01:32:05.30 --> 01:32:11.46
some back back towards some of that psychological issues that guys are coming up against we're

1047
01:32:11.46 --> 01:32:16.82
beginning to learn a new word for someone who had a bad scare who is losing his nerve we said he

1048
01:32:16.82 --> 01:32:24.74
was shook English majors such as me wonder why it wasn't shaky or shaken or something grammatical

1049
01:32:24.74 --> 01:32:31.78
but it was always shook and you knew what it meant it had little to do with the old world war

1050
01:32:31.78 --> 01:32:36.74
shell shocked that was another very precisely defined thing that came from being too close to an

1051
01:32:36.74 --> 01:32:42.74
incoming shell shook was nerves in general and once you had a man who was really shook you tried to

1052
01:32:42.74 --> 01:32:49.94
get rid of him because he was no good to you anymore it was the 76 is coming in flat and fast

1053
01:32:49.94 --> 01:32:56.42
or mortars dropping on you or fear of mines or maybe too many duck blinds and night ambushes

1054
01:32:56.42 --> 01:33:03.22
or a win that never stopped blowing those were what made you shook and so he's actually

1055
01:33:03.94 --> 01:33:08.42
he's saying that it's different from being shell shocked because he's saying that shell shocked was

1056
01:33:08.98 --> 01:33:13.22
a precisely defined thing that came from being too close to incoming shell and they've actually

1057
01:33:13.22 --> 01:33:21.38
they've actually that's not true yeah shell shocked was an only from in fact it was not just from

1058
01:33:21.38 --> 01:33:26.34
the concussion the concussion absolutely causes problems in your mind but shell shocked world war

1059
01:33:26.34 --> 01:33:33.22
one any war that you go into it's it's PTSD right it's it's it's it's fear it's the thinking

1060
01:33:33.22 --> 01:33:36.98
things to get bigger tonight it's all those things building up yeah fear of losing your legs it's

1061
01:33:36.98 --> 01:33:41.22
all those things so when he's talking he says it's not the same thing as shell shocked but then he says

1062
01:33:41.22 --> 01:33:47.30
it was the 76 is which are flat trajectory rounds coming at big giant rounds coming at you

1063
01:33:47.30 --> 01:33:52.10
mortars dropping on you fear of mines so it's being afraid that's what he's talking about

1064
01:33:52.10 --> 01:33:55.86
is what makes you shook and it's the same thing in the world war one world war two you go to any

1065
01:33:55.86 --> 01:34:01.78
war and you want to know what causes psychological damage it's prolonged fear of

1066
01:34:01.78 --> 01:34:11.86
maiming death and seeing your friends get maimed and killed that's what I believe it is.

1067
01:34:11.86 --> 01:34:17.94
I heard that shell shocked is like when they say shit the expression shell referred to your head

1068
01:34:18.58 --> 01:34:25.22
like your shell got rattled maybe they use that in football or something but you know for me shell

1069
01:34:25.22 --> 01:34:30.66
shocked the reason they said it was from showing you know that's what they said and again go to

1070
01:34:30.66 --> 01:34:35.14
I've said this on the podcast before going YouTube and watch the guys that came out of World War

1071
01:34:35.14 --> 01:34:39.46
one that was shell shocked it's it's horrible it's a horrible horrible thing to see and it

1072
01:34:39.46 --> 01:34:46.82
like makes just makes you feel so thankful that you didn't have to go through what these guys

1073
01:34:46.82 --> 01:34:53.54
went through and but it's the same you know it was to an extreme and the worst part about World

1074
01:34:53.54 --> 01:34:57.86
War one of thought about this too is like when those guys reach their breaking point

1075
01:34:57.86 --> 01:35:03.94
they got called they got sent back to England like oh this guy's a coward and of course the

1076
01:35:03.94 --> 01:35:08.90
people that are calling him cowards were people that were never on the line I mean a lot of them and so

1077
01:35:09.78 --> 01:35:13.86
yeah it's really it's really horrible I think we do a much better job of taking care of

1078
01:35:13.86 --> 01:35:18.98
guys that you know you went and did this for your country and you went through a little bit too much

1079
01:35:18.98 --> 01:35:23.78
okay cool let's give you break let's give you a breather right and take care of take care of our

1080
01:35:23.78 --> 01:35:30.10
veterans something we absolutely we do better then but we always need to focus on taking care of

1081
01:35:30.10 --> 01:35:37.78
veterans here's an example of you know what what these what condition these guys get into back to

1082
01:35:37.78 --> 01:35:42.98
the book the most bizarre was an enlisted man and dog company who had been out a long time

1083
01:35:42.98 --> 01:35:49.46
and who had been in a lot of fighting a fine marine a good solid man but now with the rotation

1084
01:35:49.46 --> 01:35:56.50
draft beckoning he began to act funny refusing to wash or shave and he would not get out of his sleeping

1085
01:35:56.50 --> 01:36:02.02
bag that was the strangest part he didn't refuse to muster or go on duty but he went everywhere

1086
01:36:02.02 --> 01:36:08.26
and his sleeping bag he cut out the bottom of it so he could walk taking mincing little steps his

1087
01:36:08.26 --> 01:36:13.54
arms and bodies completely inside the bag and the hood of the bag over his head only is bristly face

1088
01:36:13.54 --> 01:36:18.42
showing he lined up for meals that way I don't know how he handled going to the head

1089
01:36:18.42 --> 01:36:24.42
max said it was a psychological return to the womb I didn't know what to make of it he only had a

1090
01:36:24.42 --> 01:36:28.82
few days left and no one wanted to run him up for bring charges because he was a better

1091
01:36:28.82 --> 01:36:34.98
very good man but people moved away when they saw him coming because they knew he was spooked

1092
01:36:34.98 --> 01:36:40.66
because they had he had begun to smell much worse than the rest of us maybe he was shooting in the

1093
01:36:40.66 --> 01:36:46.42
bag some people insisted he did he didn't seem to mind being snubbed as he hoped as he hopped

1094
01:36:46.42 --> 01:36:51.62
around the battalion with those little steps content to be in his bag he was shook

1095
01:36:52.34 --> 01:37:00.42
gauntlet some said and I think that's the reason I highlighted that one is because they're taking

1096
01:37:00.42 --> 01:37:03.38
care of they're like hey we're not going to bring up and charge good a few days hey let him walk

1097
01:37:03.38 --> 01:37:09.38
around the state bag it's all good now hopefully they got him some help when he got out or when he

1098
01:37:09.38 --> 01:37:14.18
got off the front and said hey you need to go talk to somebody and you know relax a little bit

1099
01:37:14.18 --> 01:37:23.54
give this guy a little breather now moving forward again jumping forward in the book a little bit

1100
01:37:23.54 --> 01:37:32.98
they're they're planning an operation and they call this operation mole mole was a splendid plan

1101
01:37:32.98 --> 01:37:38.10
the sort of exercise they would probably be discussing at staff colleges for years bragging up

1102
01:37:38.10 --> 01:37:51.14
its genesis lying about its actual accomplishments so here we they're talking about what the plan was they

1103
01:37:51.14 --> 01:37:55.62
call it mole the idea is that the day after tomorrow towards sunset it will be made to seem that the

1104
01:37:55.62 --> 01:37:59.86
entire division and divisions all along the line are pulling back to new and better positions

1105
01:37:59.86 --> 01:38:05.30
for after the snow melts and when the fighting resumes we'll seem to have pulled back several miles

1106
01:38:05.30 --> 01:38:12.10
maybe more we'll sit there on the reverse slope and then until dark and then we'll crawl right

1107
01:38:12.10 --> 01:38:17.86
back into our bunkers then for four or five days we sit in our bunkers not going out of all by

1108
01:38:17.86 --> 01:38:24.10
day and little is possible at night no patrols no firing no nothing and wait for the gooks to take

1109
01:38:24.10 --> 01:38:32.82
the bait and come marching up the hill so that's the plan this is big deception plan and that

1110
01:38:32.82 --> 01:38:38.42
they all think it's pretty they don't think it's the most effective plan they could come up with

1111
01:38:38.42 --> 01:38:43.30
back to the book it was all bullshit a silly flamboyant scenario and not a real operation

1112
01:38:43.30 --> 01:38:48.34
that was how we felt and chaffy must have known but he didn't carry favor with subordinates

1113
01:38:48.34 --> 01:38:55.70
by criticizing the brass mori that again he didn't carry favor with the subordinates by criticizing

1114
01:38:55.70 --> 01:39:03.38
the brath he had argued with the battalion and lost here he passed on orders and said he expected

1115
01:39:03.38 --> 01:39:09.30
dog company would carry them out impeccably so again you see chaffy never he never breaks even

1116
01:39:09.30 --> 01:39:13.54
something you know he doesn't agree with it he made his arguments and then he says okay guys

1117
01:39:14.10 --> 01:39:21.62
here's what we're going to do and molins up being fairly unaventful and

1118
01:39:21.62 --> 01:39:28.42
they they end up coming back down off the line a week later we were relieved and

1119
01:39:28.42 --> 01:39:33.46
regimen came down off the line dog company again going down by helicopter we had been

1120
01:39:33.46 --> 01:39:40.26
46 days on the line living in holes I had not taken off my underwear in 46 days my hands were

1121
01:39:40.26 --> 01:39:44.26
so dirty if I rub them on the bare ground they became cleaner since the skin couldn't

1122
01:39:44.26 --> 01:39:51.22
absorb any more dirt but only chuck it off under friction my sore throat was gone and I felt

1123
01:39:51.22 --> 01:39:58.34
wonderful I was not the same man who had gone up the hill January 10th no better or any worse

1124
01:39:58.34 --> 01:40:04.74
just different in a month and a half of fighting we had not moved an inch forwarder back

1125
01:40:05.86 --> 01:40:11.86
a few minute died on both sides the men changed but the war did not

1126
01:40:14.66 --> 01:40:20.02
again very similar to World War I trench warfare not as bad in terms of devastating

1127
01:40:20.02 --> 01:40:27.46
numbers of casualties but the progress is just not there they come down off the line

1128
01:40:28.42 --> 01:40:33.46
now they get some good food they get some showers they get lined up for showers I was at the end of

1129
01:40:33.46 --> 01:40:38.98
a line you sent the enlisted men first if it was something pleasant shower a shower you went first

1130
01:40:38.98 --> 01:40:46.58
if it wasn't the rules were so simple once you learned them classic classic leadership you know

1131
01:40:46.58 --> 01:40:53.94
if you're so some good to be done give it to the boys if not you got to you got to do it

1132
01:40:58.18 --> 01:41:07.94
now this is this is a very another just great viewpoint so they when they're in reserve

1133
01:41:07.94 --> 01:41:14.58
so they're on the line on the hills in the trenches or they get pulled back off the line

1134
01:41:14.58 --> 01:41:18.90
in their back in the rear and there's no real threats and they're doing these exercises and

1135
01:41:18.90 --> 01:41:24.58
problems and clean new weapons and maintenance and healing up and all that and during that time

1136
01:41:24.58 --> 01:41:30.42
they actually have opportunities to fly to Japan in this case and they they call it like

1137
01:41:30.42 --> 01:41:34.74
logistics run to go to Japan but what they're really going to do and they get to Japan is

1138
01:41:36.58 --> 01:41:42.66
get with some women and for the Paltoon you can get with some women for themselves

1139
01:41:42.66 --> 01:41:47.62
and then for the Paltoon they're going to bring back some booze it's like a booze run and in order

1140
01:41:47.62 --> 01:41:54.66
to be the guy that gets to go for the geisha girls you draw straws and whoever get draws a straw okay

1141
01:41:54.66 --> 01:41:59.46
great you get to go to Japan for whatever it is three days have a great time blah blah blah blah well he

1142
01:41:59.46 --> 01:42:09.06
draws the straw and he decides that he doesn't want to go he wants to stay with the battalion he

1143
01:42:09.06 --> 01:42:14.26
doesn't he thinks he'd be wasted on him to go in years why and so I stayed with the battalion

1144
01:42:15.06 --> 01:42:21.62
the thought of that girl of any girl was immense within me but that was another world those

1145
01:42:21.62 --> 01:42:30.34
things didn't belong here after five months this battalion these hills these men were what mattered

1146
01:42:31.54 --> 01:42:38.34
there was a purity of life on the line a crude priesthood of combat that I didn't want a

1147
01:42:38.34 --> 01:42:44.66
soil for a few days of pleasure you didn't get laid up here you tried not to even

1148
01:42:44.66 --> 01:42:51.46
model your mind thinking about it I had no religious scouples about it not this time it was as if

1149
01:42:51.46 --> 01:42:58.58
Japan a trip to Japan would have spoiled something betrayed the battalion and my men and myself

1150
01:42:58.58 --> 01:43:10.58
I couldn't imagine John Chaffey on a booze run and for me Chaffey was the model so there's he talks

1151
01:43:10.58 --> 01:43:17.38
about that purity it's a real thing I'm telling you it's a real thing it's a real thing the

1152
01:43:17.38 --> 01:43:24.10
purity of combat in a war it's a real thing it's a evil thing but there's something about it

1153
01:43:24.10 --> 01:43:32.18
now things start to springtime comes and things start to fall out but you can it's not all good

1154
01:43:32.18 --> 01:43:37.70
back to the book the fall brought up green buds and turn the roads to mud here in the valleys

1155
01:43:38.26 --> 01:43:44.42
on the hills there were snow slides and at the briefing Gregory told us that along the line

1156
01:43:44.42 --> 01:43:49.54
bunkers were collapsing under the weight of layers of sandbags in one regiment two men were

1157
01:43:49.54 --> 01:43:55.62
suffocated in one bunker another Marines back was broken when his bunkers slip sideways and slid down the hill

1158
01:43:56.34 --> 01:44:02.50
Fox company lost a man when he stepped on a mind during a night exercise both legs were blown off at the

1159
01:44:02.50 --> 01:44:08.90
knee and by the time they got him back to camp and a surgeon he was dead a machine gunner shot his

1160
01:44:08.90 --> 01:44:15.86
bunk mate with a 45 then one night there was an alert and the battalion moved out fast and trucks

1161
01:44:15.86 --> 01:44:22.34
to a support position the alert was nothing the gooks never came but a Marine fell out of the

1162
01:44:22.34 --> 01:44:29.14
one truck and was run over by the truck behind so the war went on no fighting to speak of

1163
01:44:30.90 --> 01:44:37.62
and yet Marines continued to die the mountains killed them and the cold and now even the

1164
01:44:37.62 --> 01:44:45.14
fog inspired to kill them and they killed themselves and each other and sometimes the gooks had

1165
01:44:45.14 --> 01:44:54.58
their turn at it so springtime doesn't even really don't even really mean it's gonna get any better

1166
01:44:54.58 --> 01:45:00.66
and it's gonna be fighting season as well so I haven't talked too much about the enemy

1167
01:45:01.46 --> 01:45:11.78
and I thought that this was a really good little excerpt of the enemy and give you good insight on them

1168
01:45:11.78 --> 01:45:18.02
so one of the guys comes back from an operation and tells him gym we killed one guy on patrol

1169
01:45:18.02 --> 01:45:24.26
the other night brought in the body because we wanted proof you know they carry this little kind

1170
01:45:24.26 --> 01:45:31.70
of service book in their pockets this chink he enlisted or got drafted or something back in 1936

1171
01:45:31.70 --> 01:45:44.90
he fought the japs for nine years then in 47 he fought the reds for China then when Chang put out

1172
01:45:44.90 --> 01:45:51.14
bugged out to Taiwan they just turned him around put a red star on his cap and in 1950 he's in

1173
01:45:51.14 --> 01:46:00.26
creating us now he's dead 16 years of professional soldiering and all that combat and that son of a

1174
01:46:00.26 --> 01:46:08.02
bitch is still just a private soldier I got kids in my patoon got out of high school last June

1175
01:46:09.94 --> 01:46:16.66
so you get these guys again that's that's just crazy life right you fight the japanese

1176
01:46:16.66 --> 01:46:22.26
for nine years then you fight when the communists were fighting against uh Chang high Kai's Shek

1177
01:46:22.26 --> 01:46:27.86
you're fighting with him against the communists and then once that doesn't work out you just turn around

1178
01:46:27.86 --> 01:46:36.10
and you start fighting with the communists against the americans hard hard enemy and the

1179
01:46:36.10 --> 01:46:42.82
Korean soldiers were hard as well the Korean soldiers that were fighting alongside the americans and

1180
01:46:42.82 --> 01:46:47.78
they still have a reputation of being very hard I never actually worked with uh Korean marines but they

1181
01:46:47.78 --> 01:46:56.26
have a reputation of being very very hard and tough soldiers here's an example that in the book

1182
01:46:56.82 --> 01:47:05.46
maybe a little too hard some Korean marines were on 749 too that's the hill I talked about earlier

1183
01:47:05.46 --> 01:47:12.02
pure said when we made the top and there were no more gooks to flush out we dug in hoping they

1184
01:47:12.02 --> 01:47:18.50
wouldn't come back we were thin we didn't have much left across the saddle the Korean marines were

1185
01:47:18.50 --> 01:47:24.10
on top too the hill was secured but there was a bunch of Korean marines over there shouting and

1186
01:47:24.10 --> 01:47:31.30
arguing about something then they kind of stood back in one of them melt down and this guy came up

1187
01:47:31.30 --> 01:47:37.78
very close behind him and took out a hang on and shot him through the head one minute he was kneeling

1188
01:47:37.78 --> 01:47:43.54
there and then he was dead I was tired as hell but I stood up and started yelling across the saddle

1189
01:47:43.54 --> 01:47:49.94
with them I'm yelling at them to stop and waving my arms and one of them waves back being friendly

1190
01:47:51.46 --> 01:47:58.90
later I found out they executed the guy because he was slow getting up the hill but when I saw

1191
01:47:58.90 --> 01:48:03.86
him he was on top and none of them had been there very long so how slow could he have been

1192
01:48:03.86 --> 01:48:21.22
but they shot him anyways hard now as far as a little more detail on the marines here

1193
01:48:23.70 --> 01:48:29.78
each marine rifle battalion has one or two aviators who are active flyers but who for brief

1194
01:48:29.78 --> 01:48:34.82
periods of time are grounded and attached to the battalions to call in and coordinate air strikes

1195
01:48:34.82 --> 01:48:40.50
or direct reconnaissance over enemy lines so this is something that's just one of the things that

1196
01:48:40.50 --> 01:48:45.70
makes the marine course so awesome if you can imagine this so you know how hard it is to train a pilot

1197
01:48:45.70 --> 01:48:51.06
right they've trained a pilot to be a fighter pilot it's like you know they're just a tiny tiny

1198
01:48:51.06 --> 01:48:58.02
percentage of human beings in the world that are jet pilots fighter pilots and if you're in the

1199
01:48:58.02 --> 01:49:05.54
Marine Corps and you're a pilot at a certain point in your career they pull you out of your fighter

1200
01:49:05.54 --> 01:49:15.06
jet and they put you on the ground in combat to go and call fighter jets for support and this is a

1201
01:49:16.10 --> 01:49:23.62
you end up being a group in a group called Anglico which is an air naval gun fire liaison company

1202
01:49:23.62 --> 01:49:29.14
and they're so their marines and they do call for fire they call in aircraft and we worked with

1203
01:49:30.50 --> 01:49:37.46
we worked with them extensively in Ramadi and as a matter of fact we had Anglico with the

1204
01:49:37.46 --> 01:49:42.42
Anglico went with seals on I would say 90% of the operation that I don't know what I don't know

1205
01:49:42.42 --> 01:49:46.10
what the numbers but a massive number of operations is a matter of fact one of the guys is

1206
01:49:46.74 --> 01:49:51.30
we're probably going to bring one of the Anglico guys that was the exact thing that I'm talking

1207
01:49:51.30 --> 01:49:57.86
about was it was a fighter pilot and we showed him Ramadi and he's an Anglico guy on the ground

1208
01:49:57.86 --> 01:50:02.34
went on all kinds of operations went on ton of operations with life and I'm going to

1209
01:50:02.34 --> 01:50:07.62
we're going to bring him on the podcast because we just he's just an awesome guy and here his

1210
01:50:08.50 --> 01:50:12.90
here his story but that again that's one of the things that makes the Marine Corps so awesome

1211
01:50:12.90 --> 01:50:17.06
is they're like oh you're you're a pilot in your super high speed in your well trained that's cool

1212
01:50:17.06 --> 01:50:21.22
that's that's fine you're a rifleman get on the ground and start calling for fire

1213
01:50:22.90 --> 01:50:25.94
it's awesome and one of the one of the Anglico guys that they had here

1214
01:50:29.78 --> 01:50:35.78
back to the book Ramon had been shot down the month before his plane had gone in over

1215
01:50:35.78 --> 01:50:40.82
friendly ground but he had been concussed so now he was with the battalion and at least for the

1216
01:50:40.82 --> 01:50:45.78
moment once again a foot soldier of course in a sense all marine flyers are still in

1217
01:50:45.78 --> 01:50:50.26
for treatment this is what the book says and the core tries to make it so with every flyer

1218
01:50:50.26 --> 01:50:54.90
reverting for two weeks a year to commanding troops or running problems as an infantry officer

1219
01:50:55.78 --> 01:51:00.18
all of them were trained that way in the beginning at Quantico but some flyers or naval

1220
01:51:00.18 --> 01:51:05.70
aviators as they are called sometimes are softened by the good life as pilots still in a pinch

1221
01:51:05.70 --> 01:51:11.94
most of them can do a competent job on the ground and that's yeah again that's just one of the

1222
01:51:11.94 --> 01:51:16.58
things I love about the Marine Corps is they do that and we're gonna get where to get my buddy Dave

1223
01:51:16.58 --> 01:51:21.38
on here to talk about what that's like and what it was like for him think about it you're in a

1224
01:51:21.38 --> 01:51:28.34
jet you know you're in a jet fighter plane your missions are gonna be a couple hours long right

1225
01:51:28.34 --> 01:51:32.02
that's not long they're gonna be and then you're gonna be back on an aircraft carrier with or you

1226
01:51:32.02 --> 01:51:37.94
know on an air base with the good chow and all that stuff and boom you know what all that's going

1227
01:51:37.94 --> 01:51:43.62
away we're gonna put you in the field and you're gonna get after it so it's very cool

1228
01:51:46.66 --> 01:51:57.94
all right now we get into just a war so there's a Korean that comes in to talk to

1229
01:51:59.06 --> 01:52:03.06
the approaches them and and needs to talk to them about something and he's the headman of a

1230
01:52:03.06 --> 01:52:08.34
village and they have an interpreter with them and we'll go to the book he says two Marines

1231
01:52:08.34 --> 01:52:14.98
came to their village this morning they shouted for women the people close themselves in their houses

1232
01:52:14.98 --> 01:52:19.38
and a few ran into the fields the Marines tried to force some doors open but couldn't get in

1233
01:52:20.10 --> 01:52:25.30
then they went to the house of these two women to the guy has two women with them who are mother and daughter

1234
01:52:26.90 --> 01:52:30.42
when the women would not open the door the Marines fired their guns in the sky

1235
01:52:30.42 --> 01:52:37.62
the women were afraid so they opened the Marines went inside and closed the door when they came out

1236
01:52:37.62 --> 01:52:42.10
they went through the village shouting at the houses and telling people not to tell anyone they had been

1237
01:52:42.10 --> 01:52:47.86
there or they would kill them this man knows some English words he understood what they said

1238
01:52:49.38 --> 01:52:54.74
then the Marines left and the people came out it was agreed they should come to tell what happened

1239
01:52:54.74 --> 01:53:06.34
and to ask for justice that is what he says so obviously these two Marines got that gone

1240
01:53:06.34 --> 01:53:16.42
into this village break to these women and it's Brady that gets assigned with Mac I believe to

1241
01:53:17.38 --> 01:53:22.50
investigate all right the Colonel Gregory's at Regiment all assigned you to investigate as

1242
01:53:22.50 --> 01:53:28.18
investigating officers report to me when you have something he turned back to go back inside the tent

1243
01:53:29.62 --> 01:53:35.94
one more thing I don't mirror mine Marines being a little wild and I don't much like a

1244
01:53:35.94 --> 01:53:42.02
gooks but we're not going to have rape this battalion is going to have discipline their

1245
01:53:42.02 --> 01:53:53.14
Marines we won't have rape he went inside so they do an investigation and it doesn't take

1246
01:53:53.14 --> 01:54:01.46
Brady long to figure out who these guys were and then they do a line up basically they bring a

1247
01:54:01.46 --> 01:54:06.26
bunch of Marines and they do a line up and they have the women there and the women identify

1248
01:54:06.26 --> 01:54:13.62
the rapists and back to the book Scott dismissed the rest of them I turned to the machine

1249
01:54:13.62 --> 01:54:19.78
gunners you matter under arrest Jardine Saso take them down to the exec if he tells you

1250
01:54:20.58 --> 01:54:24.90
take them to division to the brig mr. Alman Allen and I will write the report

1251
01:54:26.98 --> 01:54:33.38
it disgusted me Marines shooting up a village terrorizing people raping those two old women

1252
01:54:33.38 --> 01:54:40.10
with their faces like baked potatoes how could they do it how did they think they could get away with

1253
01:54:40.10 --> 01:54:46.82
it this way we were as bad as the Nazis and the japs attacking civilians attacking women

1254
01:54:47.70 --> 01:54:53.46
it undid everything we were trying to do saving their country for these people giving it back to them

1255
01:54:54.34 --> 01:54:58.50
in that village they wouldn't remember that Americans died for their two bit village

1256
01:54:58.50 --> 01:55:06.18
they would only remember their day of horror when two Americans two Marines for God's sake rape

1257
01:55:06.18 --> 01:55:13.30
their women at gunpoint the blonde marine was the son of a minister the other was up for

1258
01:55:13.30 --> 01:55:18.98
promotion to curb corporal the records had been excellent and now they faced a general court

1259
01:55:20.66 --> 01:55:27.30
this damn reserve this being around civilians it was no good we'd been too long away from the war

1260
01:55:27.30 --> 01:55:34.18
losing what we add on the line the pride the discipline the professionalism not wanting to

1261
01:55:34.18 --> 01:55:39.86
say anything to Gibson who wouldn't understand or even to Mac who would I longed for the clean

1262
01:55:39.86 --> 01:55:49.14
hard purity of the line dedication and celibacy harsh and cleansing puritanic that was the line

1263
01:55:49.14 --> 01:56:05.94
that's where we belonged yeah and this is again combat leaders out there or you know this is the

1264
01:56:05.94 --> 01:56:12.74
kind of stuff these were two Marines that didn't that had good records and you get them off the line

1265
01:56:12.74 --> 01:56:16.82
you put them back in the reserves now they're interacting with civilians and you know they're

1266
01:56:16.82 --> 01:56:21.78
ruining their ruining these women's lives they're ruining the strategic war effort and the

1267
01:56:21.78 --> 01:56:29.30
ruining their own lives so as a leader you gotta you gotta keep your eye on this

1268
01:56:32.10 --> 01:56:36.50
back to the book another section two nights later catheter one of the new dog company

1269
01:56:36.50 --> 01:56:42.90
puttoon leaders took a combat patrol out the route we had scouted crept up quietly on an

1270
01:56:42.90 --> 01:56:47.86
important bump in the ground called hill 69 and caught some chinks asleep

1271
01:56:48.74 --> 01:56:53.30
catheter and his men drop grenades into the bunkers and shot them down as they came scrambling out

1272
01:56:53.70 --> 01:56:58.42
they killed thirteen chinks and came back without a casualty unless you counter marine who

1273
01:56:58.42 --> 01:57:04.82
tours neon the wire I went over with catheter in the morning the maps and paper and other stuff

1274
01:57:04.82 --> 01:57:11.78
he'd brought back catheter was very relaxed and calm about it so much so that when we broke I've

1275
01:57:11.78 --> 01:57:18.42
rarely very nearly snapped off a salute the man was so young so new yet so competent and

1276
01:57:18.42 --> 01:57:23.94
unexcited about what he'd done in seven months I hadn't seen a good as action as this one a

1277
01:57:23.94 --> 01:57:30.26
perfect exercise and catheter just seemed slightly bored even the kernel had catheter into

1278
01:57:30.26 --> 01:57:35.06
shake his hand and tell him what a fine example he'd set for the rest of us so here was a new guy

1279
01:57:35.06 --> 01:57:39.94
been on the line for a couple days goes out and conducts an awesome operation kill thirteen

1280
01:57:39.94 --> 01:57:46.42
no no casualties back to the book the next day catheter came down with a bad case of the nerves

1281
01:57:47.54 --> 01:57:52.10
a delayed reaction and announced a charlie Logan heating wanted to take out any more patrols

1282
01:57:53.06 --> 01:57:57.78
if a transfer could be arranged he would welcome it Logan knew you couldn't have an officer who was

1283
01:57:57.78 --> 01:58:03.30
shook leading a rifle to tune and the transfer came through to motor transport and catheter the brief

1284
01:58:03.30 --> 01:58:15.30
and unexpected hero went off new guy kicking ass still gets to him so you don't you got to have

1285
01:58:15.30 --> 01:58:19.54
the open mind on who's gonna be affected by this stuff and win because you don't know win

1286
01:58:24.66 --> 01:58:33.14
now we get to a Brady's back on the line and he's running basically a distraction operation

1287
01:58:33.14 --> 01:58:39.06
so there's a main effort there's hitting a one hill and he's just hitting this village where

1288
01:58:39.06 --> 01:58:47.46
they seen a lot of Chinese army activity and they're just doing sort of a distraction operation

1289
01:58:47.46 --> 01:58:52.98
on this village to take away from this main attack that's going on elsewhere as they're going in

1290
01:58:52.98 --> 01:58:57.62
all of a sudden there's some sniper fire and one of the lieutenant's gets hit back to the book

1291
01:58:57.62 --> 01:59:02.34
Mr. Settles hit someone said I ran along the trench bent double until where I got this

1292
01:59:02.34 --> 01:59:07.70
they'd laid settle out in the trench sniper sergeant told me I didn't know his name or

1293
01:59:07.70 --> 01:59:12.66
recognize his face must be a new man but he was a cool one I would try to keep that in mind

1294
01:59:12.66 --> 01:59:20.42
where is he anyone see a muzzle flash that's what counts first in a firefight not the casualties

1295
01:59:20.42 --> 01:59:27.70
but where the fire is coming from think about that one that's what counts in a firefight now

1296
01:59:27.70 --> 01:59:32.42
what they can't use these are but where the fire is coming from think about that never

1297
01:59:32.42 --> 01:59:37.86
aspect of your life not just like hey oh this is bad that's happening okay what is creating

1298
01:59:37.86 --> 01:59:43.06
the problem you know I see that with businesses where they get focused on the the internal

1299
01:59:43.78 --> 01:59:49.22
that's fine but no what where is this problem coming from what is causing this problem

1300
01:59:49.86 --> 01:59:54.34
so when you have bad things happening focus on where it's coming from what's the route of the

1301
01:59:54.34 --> 02:00:07.22
problem now they kind of get get pinned down a little bit and they're not making any progress

1302
02:00:07.22 --> 02:00:12.66
and finally Brady says look I said this is just a diversion we're here to hit that village

1303
02:00:12.66 --> 02:00:18.58
with four juices that's all but this sniper didn't anyone see him even get a sniff

1304
02:00:18.58 --> 02:00:24.74
no one had look this is stupid one lousy sniper isn't going to fall up this whole operation

1305
02:00:24.74 --> 02:00:29.46
it's five after six now we're late we've got to hit them as soon and take their minds off

1306
02:00:29.46 --> 02:00:35.38
fox company out there get your riflemen your bar set up sweep the valley fired anything you see

1307
02:00:35.38 --> 02:00:40.10
moving there's no high ground within sniper range so he's got to be down there in that bush

1308
02:00:40.10 --> 02:00:46.58
and tall grass you observer tell them they can start with their ranging shots HE around the village

1309
02:00:46.58 --> 02:00:52.10
then we'll give him complete in a couple minutes fire for effect got it everyone said yes sir

1310
02:00:54.90 --> 02:01:00.50
so i've gotten asked this and i think we we actually answered it on the podcast but this is

1311
02:01:00.50 --> 02:01:04.90
a situation where things are starting to go shaky and this he's not he's not throwing out the plan

1312
02:01:04.90 --> 02:01:08.42
like hey what do you guys think we should do now and hey here's the reason why no he's saying this is what

1313
02:01:08.42 --> 02:01:12.02
we're going to do we're going to make it happen and everyone looks at him and you know what they say

1314
02:01:12.02 --> 02:01:16.50
yes sir and they're not just saying it because they're well trained Marines they're saying it

1315
02:01:16.50 --> 02:01:20.82
because in a moment when they they're unsure of where they're supposed to do they're unsure of what's

1316
02:01:20.82 --> 02:01:26.26
going to happen and somebody steps up and takes a leadership command of the situation you know what

1317
02:01:26.26 --> 02:01:30.90
people say they say yes sir you see it like they teach you have a scene of an accident you know

1318
02:01:30.90 --> 02:01:35.46
they say someone you look at someone say go call 911 you that's what you do and people go okay they

1319
02:01:35.46 --> 02:01:39.22
do it why because there's a pressure situation going on and they want to get that thing handle

1320
02:01:39.22 --> 02:01:42.98
but they don't know what to do so when you when there's something going on and things are starting

1321
02:01:42.98 --> 02:01:47.46
to go a little bit chaotic you need to step up and say take charge and make these things happen

1322
02:01:47.46 --> 02:01:55.06
and that's why I pointed out that example emergency situation you know it's not it's not the debate time

1323
02:01:55.06 --> 02:02:00.74
time lead back to the book the corpsman was still working on settled but another Marine came up

1324
02:02:00.74 --> 02:02:14.82
corpsman says he's okay got knocked out as all I said good now at this point he's still trying

1325
02:02:14.82 --> 02:02:20.34
to find out where the sniper is and so he decides he's gonna stand up and make himself a cardet

1326
02:02:21.94 --> 02:02:25.86
and and said hey guys when I stand up look and see if he's seen him also flash he gets up

1327
02:02:25.86 --> 02:02:36.18
no one sees him and finally they do start calling in the fire onto this village and we'll go to the

1328
02:02:36.18 --> 02:02:42.34
book now the first rants round slammed in beautiful to watch the red burst and then the firework

1329
02:02:42.34 --> 02:02:46.74
streamers of burning phosphorus splashing out from the burst you knew it must have been different

1330
02:02:46.74 --> 02:02:54.66
at the other end a preview of hell one hut was hit directly it was on fire another hut started to burn

1331
02:02:54.66 --> 02:03:01.14
phosphorus and splashed out and now someone came out running I thought it looked like a man

1332
02:03:01.14 --> 02:03:06.50
but at this distance you couldn't tell he was in a long white garment the platoon sergeant shouted

1333
02:03:06.50 --> 02:03:14.42
in my ear do we fire no hold it hold your fire them chinks sometimes they dress up like that maybe

1334
02:03:14.42 --> 02:03:22.50
white stuff over their uniforms I know just hold it more huts were burning and another figure

1335
02:03:22.50 --> 02:03:27.78
and white spurned out in fell then the robe began to burn from another hut came two more figures

1336
02:03:27.78 --> 02:03:34.50
in white and not the khaki of chinese uniforms they ran fast and bent low zigzagging across the

1337
02:03:34.50 --> 02:03:40.66
central clearing of the village them's chinks lieutenant women don't run like that yeah I said

1338
02:03:41.86 --> 02:03:46.42
there were half a dozen people running now through the village all in white one of them on fire all

1339
02:03:46.42 --> 02:03:52.74
sprinting away from us toward the chinese lines one was carrying something it could be rifle it could

1340
02:03:52.74 --> 02:04:00.18
be a furl the umbrella it could be anything lieutenant Jesus let us fire that's a weapon okay sergeant

1341
02:04:00.18 --> 02:04:08.18
I said fire at will the bars rip off automatic fire heavy and fast two of the villagers fell right

1342
02:04:08.18 --> 02:04:13.38
away one trying to get up and then falling again you could see the bar fire kicking up dust around him

1343
02:04:13.38 --> 02:04:18.58
then a white phosphorous shell burst right in front of him we couldn't see him anymore through

1344
02:04:18.58 --> 02:04:26.10
this fire and smoke the whole village every hut was a flame now the bars fired and a white

1345
02:04:26.10 --> 02:04:33.22
clad figure fell I could see three or more or four of them running away and one of them was on fire

1346
02:04:33.22 --> 02:04:40.66
behind me in a trench in the trench someone yelled Christ we're killing women I whipped around

1347
02:04:40.66 --> 02:04:46.82
who said they're women how do you know a marine stared at me his face was twisted and I didn't know

1348
02:04:47.62 --> 02:04:53.22
them's women you can see the dresses you can't shoot women they're men I shouted at this

1349
02:04:53.22 --> 02:04:59.06
distance you can't tell me they're women not the way they run the bars kept firing nearly

1350
02:04:59.06 --> 02:05:05.30
shutting out the fire light fire flight up at two marie no and you can't tell me they're men the

1351
02:05:05.30 --> 02:05:11.22
marine said not shouting now but still staring he looked as if he were going to jump me

1352
02:05:11.86 --> 02:05:16.58
I looked at him trying to look absolutely confident then I turned back to the platoon sergeant

1353
02:05:16.58 --> 02:05:24.10
keep firing their soldiers Chinese soldiers I was not sure of this not sure of anything but I knew

1354
02:05:24.10 --> 02:05:30.66
the probabilities and I also knew I was scared from playing target so when he got up and walked

1355
02:05:30.66 --> 02:05:35.70
in front of them he was he was shaking up from doing that I made the decision to fire and I couldn't

1356
02:05:35.70 --> 02:05:40.74
back off now because the marine just as scary as I was was yelling at me he was guessing that's all

1357
02:05:41.14 --> 02:05:46.82
I continued to kneel there not really seeing anything anymore not really focusing they ran like

1358
02:05:46.82 --> 02:05:53.14
men dammit women didn't run like that behind me the marine was still there I could sense him

1359
02:05:53.14 --> 02:05:58.26
without turning I said go back to your post if you're all that worry don't fire you don't have to

1360
02:05:58.26 --> 02:06:05.30
fire there was a sort of sob behind me in a scurrying movement I felt funny kneeling there with

1361
02:06:05.30 --> 02:06:12.18
my back to him the marine was shook armed he could shoot me right here I forced myself to stay where I

1362
02:06:12.18 --> 02:06:17.78
was then there was another sound as the marine crawled away killer he risked whispered

1363
02:06:17.78 --> 02:06:31.38
or horsely as if through tears then he was gone and that that situation is actually not it doesn't

1364
02:06:31.38 --> 02:06:35.78
it doesn't get there's no closure in that situation he doesn't find out doesn't get resolved

1365
02:06:35.78 --> 02:06:40.34
in the book he does they leave they hit the village they did cause their distraction and then they

1366
02:06:40.34 --> 02:06:46.98
leave and he never really goes one way or the other and saying or never finds out he suspected they

1367
02:06:46.98 --> 02:06:53.62
were that they were men but he never finds out and that's you know obviously one young marine thought

1368
02:06:53.62 --> 02:07:03.70
they were women he thought they were men no one really knows for sure in war is hell now the next thing

1369
02:07:03.70 --> 02:07:11.86
that happens is Brady actually um uh Brady and Mac they create like a a they're own little special

1370
02:07:11.86 --> 02:07:19.06
unit and they to go out the traveling light not traveling so much gear and they're going to go out

1371
02:07:19.06 --> 02:07:24.02
and smaller units they're going to be do little special operations things and they're planning

1372
02:07:24.02 --> 02:07:31.54
to go with them of course well finally it comes time to go out in operation and the kernel says

1373
02:07:32.10 --> 02:07:37.46
oh yes Alan one more thing new neither you or Brady goes I'm not sending officer on six man

1374
02:07:37.46 --> 02:07:43.70
patrols pick your best sergeant to run them so now Mac he puts an op an argument says no man let me go

1375
02:07:43.70 --> 02:07:49.94
no sir let me go nope not gonna do it so eventually the guys go out on this little operation you

1376
02:07:49.94 --> 02:07:54.66
know little special operations mission to infiltrate enemy lines back to the book 30 minutes after

1377
02:07:54.66 --> 02:08:00.50
they went out no longer there was an explosion in front of lines Mac jumped up up bang his head

1378
02:08:00.50 --> 02:08:07.86
against the overhead logs oh damn it a mine a lousy mine they hit a mine we knew it was a mine

1379
02:08:08.74 --> 02:08:11.54
they weren't out far enough to have hit chinks not yet

1380
02:08:13.78 --> 02:08:19.14
of all the stinking luck it was midnight before we got them all in Mac and I went out with some

1381
02:08:19.14 --> 02:08:25.06
rifleman and brought them back there were three hit the sergeant lost a leg Mac walked all the way

1382
02:08:25.06 --> 02:08:29.38
back with the stretchers talking them all the way trying to comfort them saying he was sorry it was

1383
02:08:29.38 --> 02:08:35.62
them not him the Marines even the sergeant doped up and lashed to a stretcher kept telling Mac it was

1384
02:08:35.62 --> 02:08:42.98
all right no one could have helped it it was just bad luck the Colonel disbanded Mac's outfit the

1385
02:08:42.98 --> 02:08:48.50
next day he was understanding saying it wasn't Mac's fault or minds or anyone's that it might have

1386
02:08:48.50 --> 02:08:54.34
happened with any patrol he sent out bigger small he was just rotten luck no one knew where the

1387
02:08:54.34 --> 02:09:02.02
damn minds were no one could help it and the reason I put that in there is just to think about

1388
02:09:04.26 --> 02:09:08.50
like they disbanded this unit that unit might have a huge impact right they might have started

1389
02:09:08.50 --> 02:09:11.22
doing really good things they might start to break through the lines or could have all kinds of

1390
02:09:11.22 --> 02:09:14.90
good stuff could happen but it just got shut down immediately I'm not saying that was right

1391
02:09:14.90 --> 02:09:23.94
wrong to me it's actually wrong but but it's it's the risk right and if you're in a leadership position

1392
02:09:23.94 --> 02:09:30.58
and you take a risk and you get smacked on your first attempt that doesn't necessarily prove

1393
02:09:30.58 --> 02:09:35.70
you wrong you might want to saddle up again and try something again maybe assess it but these are

1394
02:09:35.70 --> 02:09:40.18
minds you know there's minds all over the place the guys walked into a mind there's like nothing it's random

1395
02:09:40.18 --> 02:09:47.22
and that's one of the pressures of being in a leadership position is you're going to take these

1396
02:09:47.22 --> 02:09:54.02
risks and even when things go wrong you got to press through you know you got to keep doing

1397
02:09:54.02 --> 02:09:59.38
them and I definitely experience that I mean your body we're we're getting you know we had

1398
02:10:01.14 --> 02:10:06.26
guys get wounded early they mean they weren't we weren't seals were not taking a lot of casualties

1399
02:10:06.26 --> 02:10:14.82
in Iraq in 2005 2004 2003 then all of a sudden we're taking casualties and we're doing different

1400
02:10:14.82 --> 02:10:21.86
types of operations we're going out the daytime we're getting really risky stuff and so for me

1401
02:10:21.86 --> 02:10:26.18
to be said okay well we took you know we had a guy get wounded bad we're not going to do this anymore

1402
02:10:26.18 --> 02:10:31.62
that would have been such a wrong answer for me to to have and the chain of command and anybody

1403
02:10:31.62 --> 02:10:37.30
to have that attitude would have been wrong yeah kind of seems like that if they did have that attitude

1404
02:10:37.30 --> 02:10:44.50
do it seem kind of natural just because you know you get you get stung for sure they can definitely

1405
02:10:44.50 --> 02:10:48.58
happen I mean it happens in business people take some risk and you can just have bad luck in

1406
02:10:48.58 --> 02:10:55.22
in situations it happens it fights sometimes for instance you got a great guy that you know

1407
02:10:55.22 --> 02:10:59.30
you got a good wrestler that's going to get a good striker and of course the wrestler goes okay

1408
02:10:59.30 --> 02:11:02.98
I'm gonna go out and take him down well there's a chance that you get caught with a knee on your

1409
02:11:02.98 --> 02:11:07.86
shot and you get knocked out does that mean you I'm never going to shoot again that's the wrong answer

1410
02:11:07.86 --> 02:11:18.66
you gotta go with your strikes yeah now this one they're preparing for another mission

1411
02:11:19.46 --> 02:11:25.06
on to go out on another mission and this mission it's it's it's on a hill called the yoke

1412
02:11:25.06 --> 02:11:31.54
a little a little terrain feature and they're getting ready to go out they got another night

1413
02:11:31.54 --> 02:11:37.62
before they leave and here's back to the book I didn't fall asleep immediately I kept yawning

1414
02:11:37.62 --> 02:11:44.10
but didn't let sleep didn't come that was nerves you never knew when you went out through the

1415
02:11:44.10 --> 02:11:50.02
lines you never really knew and for the first time I began thinking about road being rotated home

1416
02:11:50.02 --> 02:11:55.54
it was obvious that I was never going to become a rear echelon pogue that's so long as I was in

1417
02:11:55.54 --> 02:12:01.70
Korea I would be with a rifle battalion on the line now I had nearly seven months in and it

1418
02:12:01.70 --> 02:12:10.74
not gone and had not many more to go two months maybe three or four tops now I was going on

1419
02:12:10.74 --> 02:12:18.18
patrol as I done that first tour when I was scared because I didn't know anything now I knew a lot

1420
02:12:18.18 --> 02:12:29.30
and I was still scared so as attitude is not he's he's still scared and it's interesting too

1421
02:12:29.30 --> 02:12:32.58
you know he says he's not going to be a rear echelon pogue right he says as apto and

1422
02:12:32.58 --> 02:12:36.34
take oh you can go in the back no he's he's even though he's scared he's staying on the line

1423
02:12:38.90 --> 02:12:45.14
now they're out approaching the the yoke they're heading up the slopes of the yoke this hill

1424
02:12:45.14 --> 02:12:50.42
back to the book the first explosion was so shocking we thought we'd set off we'd thought we'd

1425
02:12:50.42 --> 02:12:54.98
set it off ourselves and wondered why we were so stupid and noisy someone must have trip the

1426
02:12:54.98 --> 02:13:01.14
mind some point man got it then there became the rip of burp guns from above and I realized it

1427
02:13:01.14 --> 02:13:08.42
wasn't a mind but a grenade there were chinks up there I looked around rabble was nearest to me

1428
02:13:08.42 --> 02:13:15.06
it was his first firefight rabble you okay great lieutenant I didn't think we'd be this lucky the

1429
02:13:15.06 --> 02:13:21.70
first time out well that was a healthy positive attitude so this guy's out of his first first

1430
02:13:21.70 --> 02:13:30.34
operation rabble they get they're starting to get crushed with grenades now that there's up ahead of

1431
02:13:30.34 --> 02:13:35.14
them they keep hearing machine gun firing grenades back to the book a Marine crawled over to us he was

1432
02:13:35.14 --> 02:13:40.18
bloody two but I couldn't see where he was hit he talked fast excited but he didn't seem badly hurt

1433
02:13:40.18 --> 02:13:45.22
could be able to make probably less we got up to the wire and then we when he started getting through

1434
02:13:45.22 --> 02:13:50.42
it they hit us with the grenades they got grenades up the ass they was throwing them down and we

1435
02:13:50.42 --> 02:13:56.26
was throwing them back that's how Mr. Roe got it he caught a grenade it went off he's an eye he's

1436
02:13:56.26 --> 02:14:02.26
shy and eye and it looks like some fingers how many dead have we got just the point man so far

1437
02:14:02.26 --> 02:14:08.66
unless some of these hit guys croaked but we got lots of wounded just about everyone picked up

1438
02:14:08.66 --> 02:14:14.18
something in the wire so they're getting basically attacked with grenades up there and this is

1439
02:14:14.18 --> 02:14:20.02
and we talked about grenade battles when we talked about some of the world war one stuff but this

1440
02:14:20.02 --> 02:14:26.26
guys are catching grenades and throwing them back but that's just just getting after it fall on I don't

1441
02:14:26.26 --> 02:14:32.98
know what else to say so now what they use they call in fire they call in their own fire the 105's 105

1442
02:14:34.58 --> 02:14:40.66
artillery stay low the 105's are coming in they shuddle in very loud to smash into the hill

1443
02:14:40.66 --> 02:14:46.74
sides above us I could feel the yolk jerk under me I thought maybe I should pray and I started to

1444
02:14:46.74 --> 02:14:51.86
hail marries but I never finished one short as they were I would start and then another three shells

1445
02:14:51.86 --> 02:14:56.98
would come and over me and bang into the hill and shake me like a rat my body was trying to absorb

1446
02:14:56.98 --> 02:15:01.78
the shock and I forgot where I was in the prayer and had to start again I stopped watching the

1447
02:15:01.78 --> 02:15:05.78
shells come it was too much watching them and worrying and I just laid there as flat as I could

1448
02:15:05.78 --> 02:15:12.26
my dirt in the face my my face in the dirt shoulders hunched and my next screw down tight between them

1449
02:15:12.26 --> 02:15:18.82
trying to squeeze me more more of me into the helmet shells came in like that for maybe three or

1450
02:15:18.82 --> 02:15:23.30
four minutes you couldn't really judge time it had no meaning in a situation like that

1451
02:15:24.66 --> 02:15:29.78
dirt fell likely lightly on us feeling wonderful being only dirt and pebbles and not hot metal

1452
02:15:30.34 --> 02:15:35.70
then the gun secured I think that short one there's one of the round's fell short I think that

1453
02:15:35.70 --> 02:15:41.54
short one shook the gunners up to if they're four observers saw it my body was now on the radio

1454
02:15:42.26 --> 02:15:47.30
give us machine guns on that crest again now the two guns were resumed their chatter

1455
02:15:47.30 --> 02:15:55.62
with McCarthy shouting keep your heads down and poured on and then the McCarthy yelled orders to

1456
02:15:55.62 --> 02:16:02.02
the Marines within hearing on three we go one two we were all up and running all of us

1457
02:16:02.02 --> 02:16:06.58
rabble next to me running uphill but not feeling the grade or being winded or leg weary just

1458
02:16:06.58 --> 02:16:12.42
sprinting up there were a reans there were Marines all around me some of us some of the wounded

1459
02:16:12.42 --> 02:16:17.78
must be coming with us going up a second time I didn't recognize anyone but rabble but didn't

1460
02:16:17.78 --> 02:16:23.54
it didn't matter we were attacking yoke the yoke together in daylight assaulting a hill

1461
02:16:23.54 --> 02:16:29.70
and we were going to get there I fired without aiming just fired vaguely towards the crests of

1462
02:16:29.70 --> 02:16:35.38
the hill it felt good to be running and firing I fired again around me there was shouting I picked

1463
02:16:35.38 --> 02:16:42.66
up the shout no prisoners I yelled no prisoners kill them all that's what I was shouting what the

1464
02:16:42.66 --> 02:16:48.66
others were shouting everyone took it up now everyone near me anyways it was stupid shouting

1465
02:16:48.66 --> 02:16:54.82
stuff like that my job was to get prisoners dead chinks couldn't help anyone but it just seemed

1466
02:16:54.82 --> 02:17:00.10
like the thing to shout at the moment and since it felt good I kept shouting it and so did the

1467
02:17:00.10 --> 02:17:08.34
others no prisoners now when they get a little bit closer up on the hill now I could see grenades in

1468
02:17:08.34 --> 02:17:14.02
the air one grenade seemed to be trailing something tied up with rags I couldn't understand that

1469
02:17:14.02 --> 02:17:19.78
our grenade went off right in front of me stinging both my hands in face dirt it was just dirt

1470
02:17:19.78 --> 02:17:24.50
fragments of grenades would have been hot I didn't feel anything beyond the stinging so I couldn't

1471
02:17:24.50 --> 02:17:30.26
have been hit I fired again more grenades were in the air more going off to both sides and above me

1472
02:17:30.26 --> 02:17:36.42
a burp gun ripped off a quick quick burst I looked around another grenade exploded in front of me

1473
02:17:36.42 --> 02:17:43.30
then one behind I still didn't feel anything pull back of voice came from below it sounded like

1474
02:17:43.30 --> 02:17:51.30
my cardee pull back get out of here so they can't quite get it together to take the hill those

1475
02:17:51.30 --> 02:17:59.54
guys are dug in and they're throwing so many grenades that the guys have to retreat I moved along the

1476
02:17:59.54 --> 02:18:05.38
flister now they get back they get to a little position where they can take a quick uh muster I moved

1477
02:18:05.38 --> 02:18:09.46
along the file of men and then we stopped at the little no with a machine gunners and set up

1478
02:18:10.58 --> 02:18:16.02
my cardee was jotting something does notebook later he figured out 64 of us had been on patrol

1479
02:18:16.02 --> 02:18:28.26
with 48 actually going up the yoke and 32 of us have been hit heavy back to the book I don't know

1480
02:18:28.26 --> 02:18:35.06
how anyone who hasn't been shot at up close in a real firefight can possibly understand how good

1481
02:18:35.06 --> 02:18:44.50
you feel after word men have been hurt and killed the fight has been won or lost but there is

1482
02:18:44.50 --> 02:18:51.94
only one truly significant fact that you are still alive that you had not been killed later

1483
02:18:51.94 --> 02:18:58.82
I was sure I would mourn the dead in the damaged but not now if you were not truly happy at a moment

1484
02:18:58.82 --> 02:19:05.30
like this when you just come down off the line walking perhaps you never would be happy

1485
02:19:07.38 --> 02:19:14.18
and then he goes on and this is this is this is the crux of this story by now they seem to

1486
02:19:14.18 --> 02:19:18.10
figured out about the grenades that come out us looking like they were wrapped in rags

1487
02:19:19.14 --> 02:19:24.90
someone brought in one that didn't explode it was in an old sock the chinks tried to increase the

1488
02:19:24.90 --> 02:19:29.62
explosive effect of the grenades by putting them in old socks full of black powder

1489
02:19:30.98 --> 02:19:36.82
but the chinks outsmarted themselves doing it the extra charge just blew the grenades to pieces

1490
02:19:36.82 --> 02:19:41.94
not in a nicely sized fragments that could kill you that's why so many of us were hit but not

1491
02:19:41.94 --> 02:19:49.38
badly the fragments were too small well you fought and you learned we heard from division that

1492
02:19:49.38 --> 02:19:53.94
row would make it he was on the guys that was wounded they put him up for a navy cross and he was going home

1493
02:19:54.58 --> 02:20:00.66
the other badly hit man didn't die either only the point man the first marine hit was dead all that

1494
02:20:00.66 --> 02:20:06.58
firing all that fighting all those people hit and one marine was dead and I couldn't swear

1495
02:20:06.58 --> 02:20:17.62
to it any of the chinks were dead they got real lucky that's an area back to the book no

1496
02:20:17.62 --> 02:20:22.66
one i knew who'd been there long enough missed the winter but this fighting in the heat possessed

1497
02:20:22.66 --> 02:20:29.54
its own dimension of horror you could see the wounds see what killed people the explicit manner of

1498
02:20:29.54 --> 02:20:37.06
death and injury a leg severed at the knee a mangled arm how startingly white a man's ribs looked

1499
02:20:37.06 --> 02:20:43.14
sticking out from under a flack jacket the pink at the center splintered ends with little bits of

1500
02:20:43.14 --> 02:20:49.54
meat attached all winter you were so muffled in clothes layers and layers swaddled against the

1501
02:20:49.54 --> 02:20:55.06
cold that a man could be all shot to pieces literally sieved but unless you were a corpsman you

1502
02:20:55.06 --> 02:20:59.22
didn't have to look at the broken bones and the torn flesh and see the blood pulsing from

1503
02:20:59.22 --> 02:21:05.54
arteries and veins the bodies were just as hurt just as broken but it happened under a couple pairs

1504
02:21:05.54 --> 02:21:12.66
of pants and an oversized parka men died more neatly in the winter more modestly covered instead

1505
02:21:12.66 --> 02:21:19.30
of naked and have seen the rip the part those heavy clothes gave death a certain muffled

1506
02:21:19.30 --> 02:21:30.50
discretion a man could die in decency after the yoke i thought harder and longer about the accident

1507
02:21:30.50 --> 02:21:38.50
of battle the heads are tail of combat this wasn't the ignorant fear those first weeks of war

1508
02:21:38.50 --> 02:21:44.82
i knew too much now to be frightened by everything and too much ever to turn smug

1509
02:21:44.82 --> 02:21:52.58
yet combat was still a great mystery mingled in fear and exaltation a sense of accomplishment

1510
02:21:52.58 --> 02:21:59.94
offset by neurotic guilt sheer joy at coming through a firefight and nauseating terror

1511
02:22:01.38 --> 02:22:08.90
wanting to flee the battle you were drawn to its furious center no one who had not thought could

1512
02:22:08.90 --> 02:22:16.66
possibly imagine the contradictions or the nuances some fled battle and others embraced it that

1513
02:22:16.66 --> 02:22:24.58
was the enigma i was one of those torn in both directions that caught me of war

1514
02:22:24.58 --> 02:22:34.50
coming at you from james brady now it starts looking like he's going to get rotated out

1515
02:22:34.50 --> 02:22:39.06
back to the book there were rumors i wasn't going to be there much longer that if there were a big

1516
02:22:39.06 --> 02:22:44.18
summer offensive as colonel Gregory kept hinting i wasn't going to be in it i had mixed feelings

1517
02:22:44.18 --> 02:22:49.94
about that most Marines did i guess you didn't want to be a rear echelon pogue you wanted to be

1518
02:22:49.94 --> 02:22:55.78
with a line outfit but once you'd seen combat and lost people and had the usual clothes calls

1519
02:22:55.78 --> 02:23:04.18
for most of us that was sufficient back out and heard the rumors too they say you can extend

1520
02:23:04.18 --> 02:23:08.90
if you want put in for another three months if you do it today they'd give me a rifle company

1521
02:23:10.74 --> 02:23:17.54
why mac just why this was dumb and being stubborn and i was angry at mac for saying it

1522
02:23:17.54 --> 02:23:22.58
mac screwed up his face as he did when he was thinking hard and being serious about something

1523
02:23:23.70 --> 02:23:29.86
Jim having a good company a good company like dog was when chaffy had it that's the culmination of

1524
02:23:29.86 --> 02:23:34.26
everything we've done out here being a platoon leader is a wonderful but i've done that

1525
02:23:34.98 --> 02:23:41.54
being an exec or on the staff this way is nothing i've wanted a company since i was a scared

1526
02:23:41.54 --> 02:23:50.74
replacement pfc on okanawa and all the time at vmi i kept thinking about it sure i'll extend

1527
02:23:50.74 --> 02:23:56.26
if i can get a company i'd never forgive myself if i let it slip what's three months nothing

1528
02:23:56.26 --> 02:24:01.62
not when you put it up against commanding a company of the best soldiers in the world

1529
02:24:03.86 --> 02:24:08.10
the words may have been corny but not the way mac said them

1530
02:24:10.66 --> 02:24:19.54
and sure enough mac does go ahead and volunteer to stay on board and do another tour as a company commander

1531
02:24:19.54 --> 02:24:27.78
and brady gets orders and he had to um and here is brady on the ship

1532
02:24:29.46 --> 02:24:34.10
getting ready ahead home i lay in the birth and join the novelty of electric light

1533
02:24:34.90 --> 02:24:40.98
and the sheets and the pillow and the tiny and the shiny white paint of the ceiling just a few

1534
02:24:40.98 --> 02:24:47.46
feet above me even the rows of rivets were strange and wonderful simple joys

1535
02:24:47.46 --> 02:24:54.26
i was very tired and now i could sleep with no one waking me to go outside and be shot at

1536
02:24:55.46 --> 02:24:59.78
i guess most people were anxious to get home but i hope for a long crossing

1537
02:25:00.58 --> 02:25:04.10
a leisure transition from one life to another

1538
02:25:07.46 --> 02:25:14.02
my life would my name would never be recalled as one of those who changed the direction of the war

1539
02:25:14.02 --> 02:25:23.22
but no one could take away my memory i lay near sleep thinking about the war and how i would not

1540
02:25:23.22 --> 02:25:29.38
have missed it not for anything war gave you a perspective about things

1541
02:25:30.34 --> 02:25:34.82
even painted ceilings and orderly rows of little bolts

1542
02:25:34.82 --> 02:25:44.82
i used to read how old soldiers sometimes went back

1543
02:25:45.70 --> 02:25:51.46
to walk over the ground they even had organized tours meant from world war one going back to

1544
02:25:51.46 --> 02:25:56.66
flanders to trace where the trenches had been where they had crouched and fired where their friends had

1545
02:25:56.66 --> 02:26:02.02
died tours from men from the second war revisiting normandy and walking the beaches seeing again

1546
02:26:02.02 --> 02:26:10.74
mont mont maccasino and places in the pacific i knew i would never go back to Korea

1547
02:26:11.62 --> 02:26:16.58
never sign up for no soldiers tour i didn't want to see the hills again or feel the cold or

1548
02:26:16.58 --> 02:26:22.10
hear the wind out of Siberia moaning i didn't want to disturb the dead

1549
02:26:23.54 --> 02:26:31.38
for all the fire fights for all the swagger i now permitted myself i knew how raw i still was as a

1550
02:26:31.38 --> 02:26:37.30
soldier and as a man i wondered whether anyone ever became really good at war

1551
02:26:38.34 --> 02:26:44.82
an unnatural act killing and trying to kill at that was what i had been trying to do since last

1552
02:26:44.82 --> 02:26:51.78
November when on this very first day here in the first hour i made my peace with god

1553
02:26:54.02 --> 02:26:59.94
now i had a lifetime to ponder the mystery of who lived and who died but even as i lay near

1554
02:26:59.94 --> 02:27:05.38
sleep in that crisp clean bunk i knew it was an ability or courage that had gotten me through

1555
02:27:05.38 --> 02:27:15.30
as much as extraordinary good fortune i was warm and safe and alive and i had been neither incompetent

1556
02:27:16.50 --> 02:27:24.82
nor a coward to be 23 years old and alive seemed a miracle such i would never know again

1557
02:27:24.82 --> 02:27:31.86
no matter how long i lived then i was asleep to dream of ordinary things

1558
02:27:34.10 --> 02:27:42.42
without significance rolled by the vibration and easy motion of the sea and did not realize

1559
02:27:42.42 --> 02:27:47.94
the ship was moving out with the war drifting slowly a stern

1560
02:27:47.94 --> 02:27:56.10
and the epilogue of the book which i'm going to close with

1561
02:27:57.94 --> 02:28:10.18
he gets home and settles back in and then he gets notified by the marine corps that they

1562
02:28:10.18 --> 02:28:16.58
have his footlocker had been shipped back from Korea back to the book while it was still

1563
02:28:16.58 --> 02:28:20.26
summer the marine corps notified me my footlocker had been shipped and i could pick it up a

1564
02:28:20.26 --> 02:28:26.98
grand central station my brother who is 18 and on his way to seminary drove over to help me with it

1565
02:28:27.54 --> 02:28:33.30
it was stored in the depose seller down there where they held freight and kept lost luggage

1566
02:28:33.30 --> 02:28:39.14
and such i handed a paper to the employee of the rail road and he led us

1567
02:28:39.14 --> 02:28:50.18
deeper into the seller there along with the lost baggage and my footlocker were the coffins of the dead

1568
02:28:50.18 --> 02:28:57.86
from Korea stacked and tidy each with its american flag neatly lashed on

1569
02:28:59.30 --> 02:29:03.86
like mac and samonus and captain chaffee and me

1570
02:29:03.86 --> 02:29:10.50
they too were home

1571
02:29:26.10 --> 02:29:26.50
so

1572
02:29:26.50 --> 02:29:37.22
here we are living our lives

1573
02:29:41.94 --> 02:29:46.02
safe and warm and alive

1574
02:29:46.02 --> 02:29:59.30
and we need to be thankful for these sacrifices that these veterans made

1575
02:30:00.66 --> 02:30:04.58
and as i always say we need to make sure we remember

1576
02:30:04.58 --> 02:30:16.58
these sacrifices and that we need to live a life that honors their sacrifices

1577
02:30:20.18 --> 02:30:27.54
then beyond that let's make sure we learn from what they went through

1578
02:30:27.54 --> 02:30:38.02
we learn from their experiences from men like brady and men like chaffee and Princeton and Mac Allen

1579
02:30:42.90 --> 02:30:45.86
let us be their students

1580
02:30:47.94 --> 02:30:49.38
let us learn from their

1581
02:30:49.38 --> 02:30:57.70
to the rich and let us be better

1582
02:31:01.14 --> 02:31:05.30
better because of their knowledge and because of their sacrifices

1583
02:31:06.82 --> 02:31:07.78
let us be better

1584
02:31:07.78 --> 02:31:18.74
and let's make sure that we never ever forget these men

1585
02:31:18.74 --> 02:31:33.70
and this brutal savage freezing war

1586
02:31:33.70 --> 02:31:44.74
and that goes looks like going along on that one

1587
02:31:46.50 --> 02:31:50.74
yeah so i don't think we're going to have time for

1588
02:31:51.94 --> 02:31:52.74
any Q&A

1589
02:31:55.22 --> 02:32:00.98
but perhaps you could take a moment while i decompress over here

1590
02:32:00.98 --> 02:32:07.54
and you could talk about possible ways that if somebody would like to support this podcast

1591
02:32:08.10 --> 02:32:11.62
now they might be able to do that yeah sure

1592
02:32:12.90 --> 02:32:18.18
yeah a little bit of a rough transition i respect that but that being said

1593
02:32:19.30 --> 02:32:27.06
i'm going to talk about on it like we always do i kind of feel like we haven't talked as much about on it as

1594
02:32:27.06 --> 02:32:31.46
maybe we should or maybe we have been i don't know that being said i got

1595
02:32:33.22 --> 02:32:40.34
another thing warrior bars the jalapeno one you're proving them i'm about to they didn't come in yet

1596
02:32:40.34 --> 02:32:44.50
but it ordered them and we're excited about that nonetheless

1597
02:32:47.14 --> 02:32:52.02
if you like on it supplements which if you like supplements then you will like on it supplements

1598
02:32:52.02 --> 02:32:58.34
because they're legitimate we already knew that i know you can get 10% off at on it dot com slash

1599
02:32:58.34 --> 02:33:00.10
jockel

1600
02:33:01.06 --> 02:33:04.42
warrior bars i recommend krill oil i recommend

1601

1603
02:33:18.26 --> 02:33:23.46

1604
02:33:23.46 --> 02:33:30.42
give them more accurate report they have there's a new thing like um it's like a like a

i want to say a full recovery pre workout and recovery can a drink i don't know but yeah i

1606
02:33:39.46 --> 02:33:45.78
saw it like randomly too i wasn't like trying to live at somebody asked me somebody asked me on

1607
02:33:45.78 --> 02:33:49.22
twitter the other day and i'm in a chance respond to yeah somebody asked me on twitter like

1608
02:33:51.06 --> 02:33:55.86
it was like i don't know who how old the dude was but he said something along ones of like

1609
02:33:55.86 --> 02:34:04.82
cross your heart and hope to die do you actually use honest stuff and uh yes i do i absolutely do

1610
02:34:04.82 --> 02:34:11.46
and i take krill oil every day if you're wondering about the doses i take three of the pills

1611
02:34:11.46 --> 02:34:17.54
so that's a 15 i take a lot of krill oil right because i'm a big believer in it and uh so yes i take

1612
02:34:17.54 --> 02:34:26.42
that every day i take strong bone every day i take shroom deck i don't take every day i take shroom

1613
02:34:26.42 --> 02:34:33.94
deck when the anticipation for situations is arising but the booth usually it's for a

1614
02:34:33.94 --> 02:34:40.18
a jiu jitsu scenario just be quite just straight up yeah and uh and then alphabrain i take

1615
02:34:41.14 --> 02:34:46.42
fairly regular i don't take it daily again i know i think you're supposed to take daily

1616
02:34:46.42 --> 02:34:50.98
it's matter fact you are supposed to take daily but i don't yeah i take it like i take it

1617
02:34:51.70 --> 02:34:57.22
not every day i take it several days a week i should say maybe because your satisfaction in regard

1618
02:34:57.22 --> 02:35:06.34
to your cognitive performance is pretty high your satisfaction of it maybe because alphabrain too

1619
02:35:06.34 --> 02:35:12.50
it's not like one of these ones that they're like hey let me uh let me get these herbs and i

1620
02:35:12.50 --> 02:35:16.18
heard good things about these herbs so let's throw it in there and hopefully your brain will work

1621
02:35:16.18 --> 02:35:20.98
better it's not like that like they they put it through um and you can read about it on the website

1622
02:35:20.98 --> 02:35:25.62
i'm gonna butcher that to action you're not gonna say rigorous scientific testing or anything like that

1623
02:35:25.62 --> 02:35:31.30
it is yeah i'll say it but you know they they have the actual but it's like the legitimate

1624
02:35:31.30 --> 02:35:36.98
kind test you know like double blind people like that kind of a lot of times they don't do the

1625
02:35:36.98 --> 02:35:43.46
placebo test and the placebo effect is a big component of why a lot of stuff works that's

1626
02:35:43.46 --> 02:35:48.82
a fact so if if you're trying to test something you gotta do that placebo test you know so you

1627
02:35:48.82 --> 02:35:53.46
give some people i just has sugar and see if they react to it but you make and believe that they take

1628
02:35:53.46 --> 02:35:56.50
the real thing you're like okay you guys are gonna take the real thing and then someone

1629
02:35:56.50 --> 02:36:00.66
had the you know the placebo or all of them or whatever i don't know exactly how they do the test but

1630
02:36:00.66 --> 02:36:07.30
it it basically filters out the fakers i mean it's wrong to call the placebo effect

1631
02:36:07.30 --> 02:36:11.94
fakers but it's basically you believe it so your body kind of you know the

1632
02:36:11.94 --> 02:36:16.74
yeah combination of the placebo's real yeah right placebo's totally really really yes but

1633
02:36:16.74 --> 02:36:23.78
alphabran is like past that test okay so they basically test well i think it passes

1634
02:36:23.78 --> 02:36:27.94
to be straight up proven yeah but even if you're to be like then maybe it's just a

1635
02:36:27.94 --> 02:36:33.30
plastic for me yeah yeah right or like it worked for me but it won't work for me they take like

1636
02:36:33.30 --> 02:36:38.58
the do some puzzles at speed and do it without it yeah i didn't test it like that yeah

1637
02:36:38.58 --> 02:36:42.18
or i tested when i do the podcast so yeah i take it like the night before i'm gonna do the

1638
02:36:42.18 --> 02:36:46.50
podcast i take it and then the morning i'll take it and then i'll take one more before it's good

1639
02:36:46.50 --> 02:36:51.54
evening i go time yeah yeah yeah see and that's good you know but that's because i can't

1640
02:36:51.54 --> 02:36:58.18
i can't play around bro we need to bring it here i need to bring it that's podcast now but

1641
02:36:58.18 --> 02:37:03.78
that that's that's what's called an anecdotal report on it that's not like you know scientific

1642
02:37:03.78 --> 02:37:08.74
thing because there's all these other factors what if your mindset gets into a great mindset anyway

1643
02:37:08.74 --> 02:37:13.70
you know because the point the point i'm making is i feel like not like that they actually do

1644
02:37:13.70 --> 02:37:21.54
the test and the results are scientifically proven measureably that it increases your cognitive function

1645
02:37:21.54 --> 02:37:26.42
like memory and like i believe you were good you know we get to get on it literally get on it

1646
02:37:26.42 --> 02:37:30.66
stay on it do this do this stay on it it does sports podcasts yes of course and you get

1647
02:37:30.66 --> 02:37:35.78
just put it on which is dope just put your wallet and you get to take the mint the i'll tell

1648
02:37:35.78 --> 02:37:40.34
you right now the worry was i don't know really what i did without them before yeah now all of a sudden

1649
02:37:40.34 --> 02:37:45.46
you realize and my three year old likes that that's how delicious that's very good yeah yeah they're

1650
02:37:45.46 --> 02:37:49.06
tasty i'm gonna get to all the opinions i don't know if you like the opinions because they might

1657
02:38:21.54 --> 02:38:27.38
but here's the thing on the old little small step for anyone listening to podcast big big

1658
02:38:27.38 --> 02:38:33.46
effect for those that are making the podcast yeah like a like a grenade or something we're like

1659
02:38:33.46 --> 02:38:38.50
you've ever seen in like back in science class when they put the little piece of sodium in the water

1660
02:38:38.50 --> 02:38:44.82
and then crazy yeah yeah yeah it's kind of like that but there on the old joclist door.com

1669
02:39:29.46 --> 02:39:36.66
podcast especially now when Christmas is almost on your order and all kinds of kettlebells yeah that

1670
02:39:36.66 --> 02:39:40.82
could be that could be like a big piece of sodium with a big explosion if you want to support

1671
02:39:40.82 --> 02:39:45.22

1693
02:41:53.70 --> 02:41:59.86
McNuggets first of all it's trademark I'm sure by McNinals yeah I'm sure but we're not doing it

1694
02:41:59.86 --> 02:42:03.54
we're doing a different product I think you're saying it metaphorically sure you know

1695
02:42:03.54 --> 02:42:11.70
oh I'm so there you go YouTube get on it and YouTube thank it's like a circular logic thing

1696
02:42:11.70 --> 02:42:16.34
also the jockel store I mentioned there's also a peril on there if you're into it

1697
02:42:17.70 --> 02:42:22.42
you know some women stuff well I think women are starting to be more and more represented in the store

1698
02:42:23.22 --> 02:42:28.66
you got a few items there oh the little patches the regulation size oh yeah

1699
02:42:28.66 --> 02:42:38.90

1702
02:42:47.86 --> 02:42:54.34
starting to lip cold I know we'll just say it's the temperatures for those of you and Wisconsin

1703
02:42:54.34 --> 02:42:58.50
echo apologies for saying it was cold here yeah I'm from Koli cold means different things

1704
02:42:59.22 --> 02:43:02.98
different places anyway here in San Diego you got cold my wife was wearing one I was like

1705
02:43:03.94 --> 02:43:10.50
she looked good in it in a casual sort of way so I have some women some good shirts if you like

1706
02:43:10.50 --> 02:43:15.54
literally some good shirts um you'll know what I'm talking about if you look at it you know my jockel store

1707
02:43:15.54 --> 02:43:20.98
dot com if you like something you get a shirt man get an a sticker and a patch boom you're good

1708
02:43:20.98 --> 02:43:25.14
to go any sports fight guys and you get something in return that's cool I guess all of them

1709
02:43:25.14 --> 02:43:31.14
you kind of get something in return so that's cool yeah yeah but yeah that's it boom Christmas coming

1710
02:43:31.14 --> 02:43:39.86
out it's so I know it Christmas coming up I have the reason I'm laughing is because um

1711
02:43:39.86 --> 02:43:42.98
there's one thing that you didn't mention about the shirts and I don't know if you did this purpose

1712
02:43:42.98 --> 02:43:47.94
that you're not purposely but there was one thing that you didn't mention about the shirts that

1713
02:43:47.94 --> 02:43:52.50
you always mentioned about the shirts maybe you've decided not to mention it now and we'll just leave it

1714
02:43:52.50 --> 02:43:58.42
oh oh okay I know what you see yeah are we not gonna mention it the layers and you know what

1715
02:43:58.42 --> 02:44:04.82
god here it is it is true yeah there's some layers on the shirts but sometimes if you don't know

1716
02:44:04.82 --> 02:44:10.74
about the layers here how's this and someone mentioned this before they emailed me um because I think

1717
02:44:10.74 --> 02:44:16.10
you may have realized that talking about the layers kind of takes away the the impact of the layers

1718
02:44:16.10 --> 02:44:21.30
that kind of like you just brought it up now and they're talking about it I think if you go into

1719
02:44:21.30 --> 02:44:26.90
this situation you're going to the situation not knowing those layers and you see the layers I think

1720
02:44:26.90 --> 02:44:32.42
it comes as more of a treat totally more rewarding so from henceforth we shall no longer

1721
02:44:33.30 --> 02:44:40.74
mention or speak of the layers the layers this is it for now on there we out there there will be

1722
02:44:40.74 --> 02:44:49.38
there but people will people will just have to dig in and find the layers on their own discover

1723
02:44:50.34 --> 02:44:54.58
or maybe we'll talk about them again whichever there you go thanks to something I like I like the

1724
02:44:54.58 --> 02:45:02.02
reward being dug for yeah I like that more boom and also hey when you're on Amazon there's a

1725
02:45:02.02 --> 02:45:05.22
couple of things you can get when you click through the store and you go to Amazon there's a couple

1726
02:45:05.22 --> 02:45:10.26
of things that you might be interested in getting they are my they might seem hard to get which

1727
02:45:10.26 --> 02:45:17.06
they kind of are one of the things that you can get is is called well there's a mug that says

1728
02:45:17.06 --> 02:45:22.26
get after it on it which is a good thing to have because it reminds you to get after it and there's

1729
02:45:22.26 --> 02:45:29.46
a little also a little approved stamp of approval from from me actually so it's been approved

1730
02:45:30.34 --> 02:45:38.10
and then you can also get some chocolate which there has been some so somebody finally posted

1731
02:45:38.10 --> 02:45:42.42
the other day they're like oh because I announced that we'll never run out of white to you again

1732
02:45:42.42 --> 02:45:47.86
because I ordered a ton of it and of course we ran out well we actually technically we didn't

1733
02:45:47.86 --> 02:45:55.78
okay we the way Amazon works the stuff shows up there they can only in process so much at

1734
02:45:55.78 --> 02:46:00.90
time so a ton of it showed up there they started in processing it boom so it showed up everyone

1735
02:46:00.90 --> 02:46:07.70
yes sold out but then they in process more you know the next day so what's you're going to see now

1736
02:46:07.70 --> 02:46:11.94
and I apologize for this hopefully I can get this logistical thing smoothed out it's just

1737
02:46:12.66 --> 02:46:18.26
it's taking me some time where they have so much that'll be in process and we will truly

1738
02:46:18.26 --> 02:46:23.14
never want out but what you do right now is if it's sold out just keep looking back because it'll

1739
02:46:23.14 --> 02:46:29.30
come back when they restock at the next day boom they'll have it so we'll get there I apologize

1740
02:46:29.30 --> 02:46:39.46
the tea is awesome it tastes delicious and when you have it you will refuse flat out to drink

1741
02:46:39.46 --> 02:46:44.34
anything else in the world nothing is going to come close you're just going to be like where's my

1742
02:46:44.34 --> 02:46:50.02
where's my chocolate tea strangely when I was drinking it the thing one of the things that I did do

1743
02:46:51.06 --> 02:46:57.14
significantly and I'm talking about the first time when it first came in the first time the fact that

1744
02:46:57.14 --> 02:47:02.98
you made it you know the fact that you contributed to the actual making of the formula of the

1745
02:47:02.98 --> 02:47:07.86
did you like that actually like affected the experience oh you felt you felt like

1746
02:47:08.50 --> 02:47:13.54
isn't there kind of but that makes sense right you know I guess so I think it makes it well

1747
02:47:14.18 --> 02:47:19.22
I guess we spend a lot of time doing this podcast and then you got so it's like when I guess it is

1748
02:47:19.22 --> 02:47:24.66
correct you know why because when I watch one of your videos I feel like I'm like oh that's that's

1749
02:47:24.66 --> 02:47:30.90
echo echo did that yeah yeah yeah that's echo held that camera there so I feel the same

1750
02:47:31.94 --> 02:47:39.78
way that you feel when you crack open a tin or a box of jokawaii teen you grew one up for the for the for the

1751
02:47:39.78 --> 02:47:50.10
team also while your name is on you can get a copy of the book called Extreme Ownership which I wrote

1752
02:47:50.10 --> 02:47:57.54
with my brother life bab and and you know what I got this to say don't be selfish with your knowledge

1753
02:47:58.74 --> 02:48:02.98
don't hold it back and this is this is what people get worried about right because you want to buy it

1754
02:48:02.98 --> 02:48:07.22
for you think a whole bite for my subordinates and a bite for my boss and a bite for my family

1755
02:48:07.22 --> 02:48:11.70
and you think they need to you need to get scared you get scared because what you think is

1756
02:48:12.34 --> 02:48:17.14
people are going to like see right through you and they're going to go oh you read this in that book

1757
02:48:17.14 --> 02:48:20.90
and that's why you're acting this way so you'd rather just not give it to them oh yeah yeah

1758
02:48:20.90 --> 02:48:29.46
I'm telling you do not worry about that here's why when when people have read it and they see you

1759
02:48:30.42 --> 02:48:37.94
acting it they don't get mad they actually go yeah they're taking ownership yes and it starts to get

1760
02:48:37.94 --> 02:48:45.30
that more you get more people on board the program and it makes your everything better so when people

1761
02:48:45.30 --> 02:48:51.14
see extreme ownership when people see when you see people enacting extreme ownership you don't

1762
02:48:51.14 --> 02:48:55.38
get jealous that's not actually if you've read the book you're like broho way to take ownership

1763
02:48:55.38 --> 02:49:01.86
of that man that's awesome I respect that recognize what's happening so don't be afraid

1764
02:49:02.50 --> 02:49:08.82
like you were a few minutes ago to buy this book for your your subordinates is no big deal

1765
02:49:08.82 --> 02:49:13.14
