That's freaking awesome that that we do that in the teams I learned a lot there being an instructor and like you were talking about earlier, you know watching Um 20 different groups come through people do different things in different ways and like man that was really stupid or man I wish I would have thought of that You ended up getting some tattoos and this was cool. You know like that you've got a whole sort of like Excessive conversations floating in the air had to just Yeah, I've done all in the camera here with a zero I'd be just as soon like read off the stuff you tell where to go and we leave I'd be down with that. Let's face it and that's not that's a common thing like because sometimes we can go straight up two hours before we've been Pressure cord because we're you know whatever whatever and when you think about it I'm just realizing this just now like we kind of rolled in where you like kind of all business. I think stay capable Of course you're not gonna well we all have our challenges right like how you guys were saying uh Like people's challenges are more or lesser whatever, but there are We have like that's what you're saying. and it seemed like you had plotted out a whole kind of topic here that we were gonna go into Yeah, you are gonna go right you know I feel it too, but and you know now that you mentioned that you're right Yeah, you know, I think that That uh Just letting people know like somebody thinks oh, I'm gonna go see a therapist and it doesn't work out because that therapist doesn't have with that Perpetent particular person needs It's got to read this bro Because it's a one one page chapter Called the enemy within I fully accepted all the hazards of my chosen occupation being wounded was no big deal to me At no time during or after I was shot that I ever think I was going to die I was provided the best medical care available and was sure that my physical wounds would eventually heal The real battle began when I returned home the war and Iraq was straightforward I was expertly trained and had the unconditional support of a community of like-minded highly motivated professionals Professionals as a seal I'd been institutionalized in a sense I knew the culture the people the rules and the objective After leaving the military and returning home my life became a Confusing frustrating and stressful mess. I think like Say he does that We don't like that plan the Man for you to like just go back into full on team guy mode of okay here's what's going on I'm shot up. there was this All this guy's equipment to include his name his LBE is a little bearing equipment with his magazines and it still had his name on it that his night vision goggles That is pistol That a bunch of these guys stuff and it was from what we figured out Ambushed out in the body Army unit in the body so an army unit in the body got ambushed They captured this guy's equipment and then they put it to use and they put it to use on you man and the green tip Was the only one that penetrated through the plate and Made entry into the soft armor it got about halfway through all the plies on the soft armor You mentioned the green tip like that it's standard You You well, sir, you talk about like I said you talk about some of this trauma and whatnot And here's like here's like here's a little sample of sort of how you start looking at this stuff I would spend the next 18 months training guys Shuffling papers in a administrative duty at my new command It occurred to me that those sledjammers smashing all of my body will bullets hitting me one after another It was in this moment that I said my first real prayer God please get me home to my girls My wife and two young daughters were halfway around the world in that instant I felt them and they felt me I felt like a bullet dodging character in the movie the matrix only it wasn't dodging any of the bullets They were hitting me my rifle shot out of my hands bullets whizzing past my head hammered into the men entering the room behind me even as I continued to penetrate down the left wall Nobody else in my train would be able to make entry as all four of the enemy continued to fire directly into what is known as the fatal funnel The dimly lit doorway in which I was standing The enemy bullets triggered my rage and drove me to act it was then that my body became Became my mind and took over I suppose that's what habit is when somebody when the body over rides the mind and acts without specific Instructions from the brain my right hand instinctively reached down from my secondary weapon epistol My hand was on autopilot as unhooked the rubber strap I'd fastening to keep my pistol secure and with a fluid push Food forward push and pull very same motion. but at the time there's just you know It's a chemical about I mean It's be more people are coming aware of it now that the gut brain access I mean The gut is probably a smarter brain than the one in our skull It can't operate properly unless unless you put proper nutrients and And vitamins and this doctor is also really big into the EMF electromagnetic fields, you know, you know how we're affected. I watched some YouTube videos to figure out what a Kundalini awakening look like and it's like a yoga Like you just we it says a weird like spiritual trip I guess It's awesome, but you know from my perspective there's there's no more powerful tribute than you can make then Then doing what you're doing right now, you know trying to help other people out Trying to live a good life take carry family and and really Sharing all the things that you've been through and how you made it through them with other people and I think there's nothing better that you could do to truly on reclarks His sacrifice so it's a year long work up you know broken up into three into three parts You know, pro-to-have everybody going to schools um and ULT just doing all the standard T-C-C-South Air did you guys know that you were going to Iraq when you hadn't formed up? You know where they were from so they can hang out with the family and so you're you're when you're in that job You're an advocate for all these wounded guys correct non medical case manager Non medical case manager going okay, and this guys this kid will tell you hey, you know I'm having problems with my ex girlfriend and we got to need to help with that I mean yeah, some people might think he's got some sway political views right now, but You know, I watched him take care of people and that's kind of how I judge people Yeah, you got to definitely adjust your standards in a real big way Yeah, but it's kind of cool because I'm thinking about you know your last Your previous deployment where you were kind of gathering a lot of intel and stuff like that Oh, yeah for sure when I got there When I got to team two, you know, I was hoping that I would get to be able to do that, but it was already That program was it was no longer like the seal team two was that it's all different. But there's a time limit for how long you can do this job and you maxed it out my Boss and good friend to just give me the hope I needed to climb out of the very deep hole I'd found myself in and that Instant I could not have answered my phone for anyone other than Scott Scott had seen it all before He knew that I was surrounded by wounded sick and injured people all day Scott also knew that many of the people who I'd been meeting with every day for years including patients their family members Veteran service members and hospital staff were struggling with depression It's like an alcohol attending a bar you can only hold out for so long if you're around Depressed people all the time you become depressed too So my joints Could take a beating if I wasn't on that supplementation this one of the things I was thinking about as I'm explaining it to her like I could pull it off Just need to up your joint warfare Just I might have to you know just to first sit, you know for safety sake as it was Nonetheless, yeah, so take the joint warfare just in case somebody else you do a back flip for sure Talk whatever should not inside the pool or other things. I am still seeking a continuum of care I'm recently looking at a program called Sabah warrior which hand-fold guys have gone to The last three years of my life probably be a lot better book This stuff that I've been dealing with is last three years and the fact that I'm able to manage it is is pretty incredible to me, but I don't know I think some people think Yeah, it's like a Um it'd be a disservice to call it a health drink Even though it essentially is a health drink You know what I'm starting to feel over here is that when we do a podcast like this where you don't say much during that podcast portion Maybe that sort of build some pent-up conversation where where you want to converse with you about stuff And then you just got to know when you know what you don't let the people that are more experienced, you know, take those reins. and They took an X ray of it and came back in X ray of tech was like hey, you know, there's a bullet in your head That's how I found this bullet But the way the hip is you know that that arch right there Yeah, I actually never did cold weather training I hate it I mean, I was in some cold spots, but I never you know, I got snowed on plenty I froze plenty of times out in the sleet and snow, but I never I never did the cold weather the actual cold weather training There's team two guys the old team two guys you still love that stuff. Well, I want to talk about what I call false anxiety first just bad health eating terrible dehydration drinkin too much Your physiology when you're in that kind and that state of health feels like anxiety the increased heart rate The sweaty palms the whole physiology it goes along with anxiety because of bad health It's your physiology reacting to what you people are dumping in their bodies my particular issue and What I think health care should be is an individual evaluation of each person To adjust their medical care for for that because I watch for years people take medication for for migraine and then migraine doesn't go away, but they get another symptoms
