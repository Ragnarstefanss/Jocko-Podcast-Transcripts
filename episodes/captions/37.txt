00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 37.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick, good evening echo.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000 Good evening.
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000 And with us tonight, I am honored to have retired chief warn officer Roger Hayden here with us tonight as a guest.
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000 Now unless you are in the seal teams or you were in the seal teams, then you likely don't know who Roger Hayden is.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000 In fact, I'm going to go ahead and guarantee you don't know who Roger Hayden is.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000 There's no book, there's no movie, there's no social media, there's no one to google.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000 And I've talked before about how there's three types of guys in the seal teams.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000 The guys that built the reputation that the seal team has, the guys that maintain the reputation of the seal teams.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000 And then there's the guys that live off the reputation of the seal teams.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000 Usually those guys didn't contribute much to it in the first place.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000 But let there be no doubt Roger Hayden is without question, without question.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000 One of the people, one of the men responsible for building the reputation of the seal teams.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000 He did the massive heavy lifting and laid down the foundation of everything that the seal teams are in the jungles of Vietnam.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000 And he passed on lessons of combat written and blood that we carry to this day.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000 One of the guys here, Roger Hayden that truly forged the attitude that makes the seal teams what the seal teams are.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000 And I'm going to tell you quickly how I first heard of Roger.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000 So I was back, I was a new guy at seal team one. So it's 1991.
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000 And back then no one really seals weren't that popular yet.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000 And the old seal, UDT seal reunions were not that big of a deal.
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000 There, there were just kind of a small little gig down it, down it like the Lions Club or something in national city, real low key.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000 But the only guys, none of the younger seals went to him who's all Vietnam seals, maybe a couple world war, two guys.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000 And I was down there with my run and mate at the time, my good friend who's at seal team one who I've gone through buzz with guy by the name of Chris.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000 And we were just sitting around talking to some old Vietnam guys and we were getting pretty fired up.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000 You know what's kind of, there's, you don't want you pay the $10 feet to get into this gig.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000 There's free beer. So we were a few beers deep. You might say we're listening to stories.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:22.000 And again, we were new guys. This is 1991. We didn't never been in combat. So we were there to try and learn and about the history and learn about the guys and finally me being young and dumb and pretty well buzzed.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000 I asked these two Vietnam guys that we were sitting there talking to.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000 I said, hey, who was the most badass murder in mother fucker and seal and Vietnam?
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000 And both these guys looked at me and said Roger, hey.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000 And I remember that name. And when I actually met you for the first time, you were, I'd met you a couple times.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000 But then when I actually worked with you for the first time, you were a lane grader on a patoon, full mission profile.
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000 And that's actually the first time I learned truly understood the concept of cover move, which is a basic tactic, which guys didn't know.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 No one had taught it to me. This was my second patoon. I'd already been through a workup.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000 I had the idea in my head, but here in you say it the way you described it, I said it, be clicked in my head and never forgot it.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000 And I actually wrote about it in the book, extreme ownership. And that's what I taught all the seals that when I was putting through training, that's what I taught them.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000 One of those fundamental tactics. And so that's kind of my introduction to Roger Hayden.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000 So Roger, I know you've actually literally never done an interview before.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000 And I want to thank you for coming on. It's a true honor to have you on the podcast. So welcome.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:59.000 Yeah, Roger Hayden here. Thanks, Jack. I really appreciate it. And you're one of my heroes who different environment different times did you kick ass and tuck names to.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000 I wasn't, I was just one of the boys in the, in CLT-1 when I got there and deployed a couple of times with them.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.000 And our environment was the jungle and we got pretty good at it. And when I went out and hunted the bad guys, nobody else in Vietnam as far as I know army Marines.
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Or any of them would go out at night. They would usually hold up at a base camp or somewhere like that while we figured nighttime's when they move around.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000 That's when we're going to move around. Simply can find these guys and take them out. That's what we did.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:47.000 It isn't one guy. It's a team effort. Everybody works hard. I had some great great buddies in mine that were, I mean, my gun partner was a stoner guy. And I was a 60 guy between the two of us.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000 He shot a thousand runs a minute and nine of five five. I mean, a 716 my 60 at work out well.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.000 Last but two night was in we carried four 60s and five stoners. And if you get in carry a stoner or a 60, you carry that 16 with a 203 on it or XNM 140 for back committee guys.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000 Say those numbers again of how many guys were carrying 60s and stoners for us or carrying 60s and five guys carried stoners out of a 14 member to that's what we operated.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.000 So those used to fill in out there that are listening, that's a lot of firepower. That's that's a way you bring the thunder. And so where where'd you grow up though before you got the teams where to grow up.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:39.000 Basically my roots in what I look at my dad was a carpenter. So we moved quite a bit around but there was a place called Roanan Montana by the flat head lake in Montana.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:57.000 And I really have the mission range and a real real brief area. I grew up green breaking horses and stuff like that and building three houses and just working on my grandpa's farm and my uncle's ranch and stuff like that. So that's kind of where I grew up at.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000 I lived a wild Phoenix Arizona and stuff like that and says here in the next thing sports where I played football outside lineback or I box for two years in high school.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000 And I swam my dad built work on the tram and palms springs and when he was there I went to pond spring high school so I got on the water pole team there.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 So that's that's how you got a little comfortable in the water.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Yeah. Oh yeah.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000 So at what point what year was it when you actually decided you're going to join the Navy?
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:37.000 I was 1965. And did you know already know about the seal teams? Well, no nobody's not about him.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:54.000 My dad, like you said he was a carpenter but he was in UDT3 and it was at Swam on the in Chilin Harbor in Vietnam but I didn't I'm not getting I'm Korea but I didn't know anything about it because you never talked about it.
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000 Your dad was a frog. Yeah, but I mean that's I knew guys that knew him over older guys.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000 I mean when I was young guy like he said you were your talking.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:22.000 So anyway, but he never said much about it but when I was a kid, you know I watched the bridges river quiet and the guns never owned and I also seen the marine sitting beaches and the Rangers getting wiped out and I went okay if you're going to fight you want to get something that you think you're going to come back with.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000 That's why I became a frog man and we didn't go through buds. It was UDT or a underwater demolition journey.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000 So, you got, so you joined the Navy did, did you go straight to straight to underwater demolition journey?
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000 No, no back in the day they wanted to have an A school.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:49.000 So I got a boot camp in 65, went to North Island in Coronado for about seven months waiting for my radio in school.
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000 And it was lucky enough to go to 22 weeks of radio in school.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000 And then went from there to the US as Paul Rivera for about four months and then went to training.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000 I started training January 6th, 1967.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000 How big was your classroom you showed up to that?
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000 There was about, I don't know, 200 of us maybe, maybe 150.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000 How many guys made it?
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000 There were about 30 of us that made it, which was pretty good and it was colder than shit.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000 I don't know how you guys did when you went to training, Dr. Cobb.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000 But we made a pack that we were going to land in but it quit.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000 We did everything we could to make that happen.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000 And some guys did make it through that we shouldn't have.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000 Yeah, that's one of the, that's one of the things I've talked about with Lafayne is,
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000 you see that and I was never in structure at buds, but eventually you say, you don't want to help people through.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 They're not going to make it through on their own. You don't want them.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000 You know, you got to get guys that are going to get through it on their own.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000 Yeah, but you know what I mean? Yeah, no.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.000 Yeah, no.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000 We got close and we got a figure.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000 You know, I had a guy who was a previous fleet guy and he had been to buds before.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000 And I became friends with his second class mature guy and I thought, yeah, this guy.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000 I'm going to kind of follow his lead a little bit.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 You know, second night of hell week, he quit.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000 I was just, I was laughing.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000 I'm like, oh, but here's a mature guy.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000 Twenty seven years old, you know, I was a kid and he's quitting ridiculous.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.000 So then you, but when you got done with the initial UDTR A, you went to a, you checked it out.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000 UDT right? Yeah, he's really funny because, you know,
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000 good friend of mine up in Flagstaffs, what are you joined in?
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000 We decide we're going to be Marines, you know, so and he's dad, you go out of canal, you name us.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000 This is an uncles, D.I.s. you just a Marine, but he talked me into it too.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000 So we went up to doing the Marines well.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000 That officers closed and right across the hallway was the Navy Recrearing.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000 And there was a boesmete of the line, you know, lean against the, the door and he goes,
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000 When he boys do, you know, we're going to join Marines, you know, which, you know, that's so good.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000 And he goes, I asked the other guy, well, you're parents background, everything.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000 And he's going to be a Marine, sorry, knew it. He was going to be a seven to two.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000 Well, my dad was in the Navy, a chief in the dead as he says, come here, son.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000 So my buddy went off to be a Marine, I went to Navy.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000 That close.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000 Yeah, I think we all have a story like that.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Yeah, I know really close.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Yeah, I had a buddy Bruce. We saw, like, some ship pulled in and we saw guys,
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Marine uniforms and we were like, let's go join. Let's just go join.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000 That's how effective that recruiting to this. Oh, yeah, it's a lovely, I like it.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000 With a longer one. It wasn't open. You know, that's about the Marine and the Navy office is open.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000 So it's a really nice office.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000 And so he showed up at UDT and then what was the schedule there?
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000 I mean, the Vietnam War was already on. So now it's like, is it in 1966 now?
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000 No, I didn't. Got one into UDT 67. I graduated in training,
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000 I was in the UDT. Yeah, the word been on. And then we had heard a little bit about
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000 SIL team, but still didn't know very much about it.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Because everybody I graduated with, these course and west course,
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000 you went to a UDT team first. Then you did a trip with UDT.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000 Then you came back and got in the SIL team.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000 And how was that first trip with UDT?
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000 I was great. I was in a nine month trip and we had different debts that you went to
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000 in Vietnam. Like first thing we did is go to Denang.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000 Please, cold camp 10 shot and we worked up at Fueway, way, Quang 3,
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000 Dung Hall all over the northern part of South Vietnam.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Doing demo work, different things, you know what I mean?
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000 And then we left that debt and went on the U.S.S. Tajanko.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000 And we did about 110 miles of beach recon.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000 And then from there, we went some of us went down to a debt in the...
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000 Will this hydrographic concert or whether just we had the college?
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000 No, that's perpindic. Old school, perpindicular.
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000 For parallel, not perpindic, but most from repair, we didn't do any perpindic,
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000 or is that your combat, you know what I mean?
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000 So for those of you that don't know, the original job of one of the original jobs
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000 the U.D.T. was to find out how deep the water is off of a beach.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000 So an obstacle. And if there's any obstacles there,
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000 that could trip up a boat that's coming in.
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000 And so you said you did 110 miles of that.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000 Yeah, three months.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000 That's an interview. Basically you have to swim with a lead line.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000 So you have a cord with a piece of lead on the bottom of it.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000 You've got different markings on it to tell you how deep how long it is.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000 And you sit there and you swim along.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And you rate every 25 meters.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000 And you have a beach party on the beach.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000 And it has a swim line going out.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000 And we had a hook to an IBS.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000 In case we got intercepting that IBS can turn and get us out of the railroad.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000 Grab onto the course of it's only a 9.5 or 5 region.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000 So you didn't go out very fast.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000 Yeah, you'll swim fast.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000 But every 25 meters, it takes sound means sound means sound means when you got back to the
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000 Dachinko then the photographer, which I was lucky enough to be one, you do a
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000 A hydrographic chart.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000 When I got the UDT 12, you know, you're pretty regimen it.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000 And I'll call it by as it was UDT.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000 It'd be a pretty regimen.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000 But when we got there, our proteins were even formed up.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000 And you were kind of lost at sea.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000 You know, I mean, no, he's really telling you what you have to do.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000 You're not in the plutonium.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000 And it was kind of floating.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000 I mean, we went up and did lifeguard stuff for the Marines when I did land
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000 Theumsupite penalty time stuff like that.
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000 It wasn't really a lot to do.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000 You know, we're going to Jesus.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000 You know, play volleyball lot.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000 You know, ran around your UDT's and four boots.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000 And you know, so then we started forming up and how UDT worked is that
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000 You'd, they'd be home for nine months.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000 And then the whole team would deploy and relieve the team that was out
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 There, like we were really duty to 11.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000 And the level would come back nine months later, they would come out and
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000 Relieve us.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000 So as nine months deployments and almost port and starboard,
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000 You didn't have like a year and a half, two years of work.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000 That was about nine months.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000 And then months home with a work up.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000 And there was the work up.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000 What did you do in the work up?
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000 Oh, we did everything.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000 We did recon.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000 We did demolition raids.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000 We did river recon.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000 So we just, how many guys were in the UDT pool team?
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000 18 or 20.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 Maybe it might have been 20.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000 It was quite a bad because you got this one relying on the party and all that other stuff.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 You know, that's why we did the old part.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000 We always try to get a couple extra guys because we didn't cover more beach.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000 It should same do.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 Yeah.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000 And everything you did on and we'd do just, it was just a lot.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000 You know, I mean, and it was a lot of physical work too.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000 And everything.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000 UDT actually went into training.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000 I think we did about 50 times more swimming than the guys doing bugs now.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000 Because that's what we were real frog men.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000 You know, so.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000 Yeah, that's a lot of the future more swimming than we did a bug.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000 That's a lot of swim.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000 I'm glad I went through bugs instead of that.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000 Well, they're surf out there and January is pretty cool.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 Yeah, there's no doubt.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000 And when you were there, you tell me before about some of the kind of hook and onto some of the conventional units on some of their operations that they did with the, I think it was the 19th century.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000 Yeah, so we were down in the Delta.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000 I know, we were doing river recon's.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000 And I think we're the ones that ever did with this.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000 They called them the darts and it would look like a jet ski, but you laid on it and you got it with your feet.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000 And had a 355 degree camera up on top and a father on the bottom of it.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000 And it had a piece of aluminum like this of course.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000 So you wouldn't get hit with a prop's of stuff.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 And the handles were on the right and left.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000 You don't understand.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000 And they went up to about 30 knots.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000 What they would do is take two of us either by chopper, something drop us in a canal.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000 It would come down that canal.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000 Then we got back.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000 We do a chart of that.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000 And that would let the 19th century in their river in boats.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000 No, if they could go up there and do a landing or not, that's one of the things we did.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 Of course, you only would down the river.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Maybe once or twice and you didn't go down any more.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000 I was too, which you care for, which you carry like a side arm when you're on that way.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Yeah, we had a 45 in front of the cover there.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000 And that's what we had.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000 We had a black jacket on a helmet, UD keys and.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000 And we had a tight weather fee.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000 Which you do tonight or the daytime?
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000 A daytime.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000 Oh, day.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000 And then, you know, with that 350 degree camera across,
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000 canals coming into pagoda.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000 Is anything that was a known thing you could find on a map.
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000 Would take a picture of as we went down.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000 You tried to stay at the same speed all the way down.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000 Because otherwise your your chart wouldn't be good.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000 But we could really did that.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000 We couldn't do it too much. So, I mean, just a different rivers and different canals and stuff.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000 So, we got bored.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000 So, we started going out with the 9th century on those river boats to be their demolition guys.
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000 Blow a bunker.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000 And sometimes they put log dams across the river.
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000 We blow those up and stuff.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 And we took some heavies on that doing that.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000 So, it looks sort of kind of situations to get in when you're writing up with a 9th
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000 Infantry.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000 Well, we got caught in ambush one time.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000 They usually had about 7.5, 6.7 boats.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000 They had a boat in the front called an alphabet.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000 It looked like your old,
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 Monterne and the Civil War.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000 And then they had like the landing craft.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000 They had those with bar armor and the side.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000 And then they had 50s up on top and back there that old build up.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000 And they had bar armor.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000 So, that if a B40 rocket punch suit and they had real thick styrofoam.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000 So, that would just be channeled into one area if they hit them from the sides.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000 And they had 30s, 230s on each side.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000 Each one of the landing craft type of boats that they put the troops in.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000 And right in the middle of that was what they call monitor.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000 You've seen that.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000 That was that's over in Cismfield.
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000 That's a great big boat.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 And then to back they had another alphabet.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 And then all the ones in between.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000 So, who was the, what are those navy boats?
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000 Were they army boats?
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000 No, they're navy.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000 They were navy guys doing, I wouldn't have that job for anything.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Yeah, no.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000 So, anyway, we was going up and a group at one of the before-estrops.
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000 There are people off.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000 They came right by us.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000 As soon as we got by them, they opened up on us.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000 And then it was a bad day.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000 We had 30 killed in 70 wounded Americans.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000 Yeah.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 And like the alphabet had of us.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000 Everybody but one guy was killed on.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000 And that boat was floating by and still the American flag flying.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000 And there was one guy on the back on the 30 still shooting.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 I mean, it was, you know, it still almost quacks me up.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000 Not quacks me up and tears me up when I think about that.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000 But it was just, that's the American flag.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000 You know, that's the way we are.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000 So, not give those riverbow guys all the credit in the world on those tango boats.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000 Because they're just sitting targets, you know.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000 And then after we got hit of course, we all got, we, we're in the fourth boat back.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000 And we heard number one boats hit.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000 That was the, number two boats hit.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Number three boats hit.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000 We're number four boat.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000 There were three of us shooting T guys.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000 And I've both never remember looking over again.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000 He went, you go on work fucked.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000 Excuse me, I shouldn't have said it.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Anyway, then we got hit, blew us all down and stuff.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000 And I've, one of everybody's had about 53 pieces wrapped running.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000 So I called it over to him and hitting with morphine.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000 Got up in the Navy.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000 Got blown off the 30.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000 You know, so I shoot in that until I round our rounds and shit.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000 Well, the other guy, I know that was, I got hit.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 The other guy saw tall mess up.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000 So he goes over and didn't see my pins who was collar.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000 So he had seen with another shooting more.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000 She didn't.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000 He lived.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 And then me and,
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000 I mean, we just, our shooting was the sides and stuff.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 And the army guys wouldn't get up and shoot there.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000 Handing us up weapons or shoot.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000 Well, sometimes I'm giving them to us and we're up there hammering down.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000 Sometimes you get a frog band up.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000 Then the cobras came in in army cobras and,
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000 holes everything down real good.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000 So what they were, they doing like an actual landing.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000 That's what the purpose was.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000 And they were going to get a beach foothold that work an area for a while.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000 Work to make a sweep through there and don't ask me why the Marines weren't doing it.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000 We had the night.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000 I tell you why the Marines weren't doing it.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000 Was there a hole in the DMZ up in the north?
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000 They shouldn't Marines.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 That's their job.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000 But the ninth infantry did a good job.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Yeah.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000 Well, I know you haven't listened to this podcast much,
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000 but I know you have, you have read the book that that lay for me.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000 And you know that I have nothing but nothing but the most utter
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000 highest respect for the Marines and the army units that we work with
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000 were just phenomenal.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000 And the sacrifices that they made in the bravery they showed on the battlefield
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000 was unbelievable on a daily basis.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000 So I know it's definitely something.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000 And you think about this now.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000 Think of the training that we went through just for UDT to start with.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 And then I came back meeting with the seal team.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000 So you get all the what you guys call a SKT.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000 We call it Cadbury back in the day.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000 And then you go over again.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000 You've already had your feet in the gun.
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000 Now you figure these army guys go through basic training.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000 And a lot of them had right over the Vietnam.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000 You know what I mean?
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000 And they could be in Shal Valley anywhere.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000 And where the crap probably hit the hit the brick and you imagine that.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000 We had the training.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000 We were volunteers.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000 We volunteered for what we're going to do.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000 We weren't just saying here.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000 You know we knew exactly where we were going to go.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000 And we wanted to go.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000 You know what I mean?
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000 So yeah.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.000 Yeah.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 You know another weird thing about Vietnam.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000 I've talked a lot about Vietnam books from Vietnam.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000 Guys that from that were Vietnam here.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000 And you know, the fact that these guys would rotate out.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000 You'd be in the middle of the deployment.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000 You just, you know, guys were just rotating out all the time.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000 You know, it wasn't like what you just described what you did in the seal teams and in
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000 UDT.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000 And what we still do in the seal teams now is you get with your guys.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000 You go through a work up with those guys together as a team.
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000 Then you go on deployment together as a team and you come home together as a team.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000 And the army guys, they would just, yeah, they're just filling in the holes and the guy would go home.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000 And another guy would take his place.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000 So you never work with this.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000 You know, you could have a guy on a patrol with you two or three guys.
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000 You never work with before you're going out of patrol with him.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000 So it's, uh, I don't like that system.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000 I like the way we do it.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000 We might be a force company.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000 You know, that was, well, where you get a little thing.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000 You know, what happened?
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000 No, the new guys that came into the platoon.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000 You know, was it?
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000 Oh, yeah, I was checking in.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000 Yeah.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000 Everybody's already been there already.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000 They're just coming in.
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000 They hadn't worked up with these guys.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000 Nothing.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000 They were just showing up.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000 You know, poppin' in.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000 We actually did take a couple guys in when I was in the body.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000 We took a couple guys that just showed up.
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000 We just got a new guy's and we just had to slowly, you know, put him in the watch.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000 What did you have?
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000 People that were taking out.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000 That's why they came in.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000 And they were just guys that were filling in.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000 We did.
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000 We lost guys, but they were just guys that they, they got sent to seal team three from SQT.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000 And when they got there, there's no one there.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000 So they brought him over on the plinit.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000 A couple guys was like two or three guys.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000 And we just, you know, okay, here's, we made a work in the compound for a while.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000 And then maybe bring them out.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000 They'd be a turret gunner on top and maybe eventually get let them do the work.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000 Yeah, that's pretty obvious what you should do it.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 And so any other, any other, any other, then,
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000 And then we used to teach stuff, yeah, so another time we were,
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000 We used to be on the front boat, the alpha boat,
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000 because they're, were the first ones that saw the log dams or
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000 we didn't had to blow a bunkers in shit.
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000 And we had about a big stack of sea-fjorn in the back, you know,
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000 the haversax in shit, you know, and also in the whole boat.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000 It shook like this. We got to be 40 rock at right in one of the exhaust tubes.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000 And we started sinking.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000 So we, they give the cocks and ran it to shore and everything.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000 And we were shooting back and everything, but the fucking boat was sinking.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000 And if that had been about another eight inches higher to hit all that sea-fjorn.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000 But we landed, and then we swam off and got out in the river
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000 and this other, they called it a zip-able.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000 It was like the tube carry in both of us. It was all napon,
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000 or not napon, whatever they got in flames, the worst, you know?
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000 Oh, flames for our boat.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Okay.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 And this thing just went on the beach and on we went and climbed up on that.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000 We got out of there.
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000 That's in the crewman.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000 That was, that was an other moment of excitement.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000 You know, it's, it's just to go off of what you just said to,
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000 with the training that you get in special operations.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000 The old teams, whatever, Rangers, SF.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000 These, you know, a lot of times we, in special operations, get a lot of praise for doing what we do.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000 And that's great and everything.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000 But like what you're talking about, being in a conventional unit,
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000 it's the same thing over in Iraq and Afghanistan, being a conventional guy.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000 It's no joke.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000 I mean, it's, in many cases, they're doing a much more dangerous job.
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000 I mean, even, you know, logistics jobs, something like that,
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000 where they're exposing themselves on a regular basis.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000 So anybody out there that's a civilian that thinks that the conventional guys
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000 aren't doing, you know, aren't taking as many risks as a special operation.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000 Guys, I'm telling you right now, they absolutely are.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000 They absolutely are.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000 And of course, there's things that that all special ops guys do that,
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000 step it up as well.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000 But everybody, everybody pays a price and everybody takes a lot of risk when they go over there.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000 And it sounds like it was the same thing when you had the ninth infantry roll and up the river.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000 Yeah, those guys were good.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000 They didn't do jobs and if I seem to say anything,
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000 derogatory, I apologize.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000 Oh, no, you didn't.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000 You didn't at all.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000 You didn't at all.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000 I'm just pointing out a lot of times.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000 Again, people, I'm sitting here thinking,
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000 I'm thinking exactly what you just said, here you are,
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000 you're easy to, you've been through all this training and you,
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000 you know, when that boat starts thinking, you're like, hey,
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000 I'm going to jump on the swim.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000 There's a regular army guys there.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000 They're, they're thinking they haven't had the training that you had.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000 And yet they're still in the same almost the same exact situation.
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000 So one other thing in duty,
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000 we're doing a beach recon and I was like a photographer,
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000 so I'm up in front with another guy and I'm at this big huge piece of
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000 plexiglass.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 I'm doing all the back-sour information on,
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000 but I'm ahead of him.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000 We're putting in the stakes.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000 So the guys behind us can hit every 25 meters and do their sound needs and stuff.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000 Well, we didn't usually we had Arvan,
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000 which are your south-eastern,
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000 the Meas Army or we had Marines that would do screening force.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000 You know, when we were doing the beach recon,
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000 so we couldn't get either one of them.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000 So we had two of our own guys doing it.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000 So there were walkin' going behind.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000 It was all, a lot of sand dunes and stuff like that on the beach.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000 You know, trees, little forces of,
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000 well, we almost walked right into his L-shaped ambush
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000 that they had set up force except the two guys back here.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000 They had a spider hole back here,
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 so that when we fell back from the ambush,
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000 we'd show off any of us were still living.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000 These guys would get us right.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000 They hit these guys.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000 So I made them open up, which made them open up earlier,
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000 then we leapfrog down and got out of there.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000 But that was a few moments of excitement too.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000 And that's when I got back to the USS-Dyshink,
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000 and I went, you know,
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000 screwed this naked warrior shit.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000 Tell me how sexy it can be,
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000 I'm gonna be glad, nothing's got to do it.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000 I don't like running down the beach and UDTs,
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000 I'm gonna call a boot shoot in M79,
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000 even heads down and shit, you know what I mean?
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000 Yeah, it was, but I was just UDTs,
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000 and so I didn't talk too much about it, you know,
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000 I wasn't a seal.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000 So you get back from that deployment.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000 Oh yeah, yeah.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000 Every month when I was on that deployment,
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000 I mean, I got him,
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000 we'd put in a chip to go to the seal team,
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 and they'd just cheer or ask us out,
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000 he ain't going anywhere until we get back, you know.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000 All right, so we'd wait a month and put another cheat in.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000 And when we got back, boom, we weren't right to a,
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000 Cadry, go and check into SILT-1 and then went into Cadry.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000 And the counter trading was what we call now,
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000 SILT, SILT, SILT.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000 All your ID's, all that stuff,
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 and actually on the Alimal River,
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000 and a few other places they had it set up to be exactly like,
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000 it would be in Vietnam with watched little watch towers,
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000 and they had a whole village that was in amongst all the shit
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 that's on the side of the Alimal River and stuff.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000 It was really good turning.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000 Yeah.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000 And then we'd do that ambush ass with ambush them,
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000 they'd come down in, you know,
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000 sand pans we had there and stuff like that.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000 And just like on a, you know,
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000 you do an ambush on a river,
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000 you always want to try to do it at a curve,
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000 and hit them.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000 So that way the sand pans after you hit them and stuff
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000 or flown to the bank.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000 And keep on going down the river and you can't get enough of them.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000 Just all kinds of little tricks.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000 And what they did, our cadry,
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000 that ran us through the,
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000 our cadry instructors were guys that had just gotten back
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000 and they pulled them out of the platoon to do that for about six months
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000 before they went back into another blue tune.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000 So we were getting continuous guys right out of the field,
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000 and we had an arm which is all good in different areas too.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000 The triple canopy shed, your mangrove stuff,
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000 and you know the race paddies and all that stuff like that.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000 Where would you do a bulk of the training?
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Oh, out of the nightland.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000 And then we'd go up to Quimacca for map and compass and stuff.
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000 And then a bunch of us went through what they called
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000 sealed van training,
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000 which is for your proof program,
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000 which was five months long.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000 And that was all tree graph medical and stuff like that.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000 Really, really good. Got really honed in more even on the I.D.s.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 and stuff like that.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000 We would be trapped trails, in kale trails, all kinds of stuff here.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000 It's interesting as you talk about that,
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000 how much of that stuff carried on to you.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000 When I showed up at Zilting, but one,
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000 you know, we did the all we did booby trap trails.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000 You know, there was no more than a minute of work going on for 20 years when I got there.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000 You know, in the Gulf War,
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000 but we still did booby trap trails.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000 We did point mancourses.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 We did the medical stuff.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000 We did river ambushes.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000 It's awesome that that.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000 And there was no,
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000 it wasn't really written down anywhere.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000 That's yeah, you should add two weeks of advanced demo and catch in table demo.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000 Oh yeah, because we sent all that up until the one I know it's you had.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000 Shoulda, she'll been going.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000 But that's awesome that it lasted that long.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000 You know, with no,
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 because the weird thing about seal team is,
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000 we didn't used to have anything written down.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000 It was barely anything written down.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000 And so all that knowledge was passed word amount from guy to guy to guy.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000 And that's,
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000 I think we've corrected that now where we capture more of the stuff.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000 You might, but you know,
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000 you have everyone in fight rangers.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000 Get the ranger handbook.
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000 That's the only thing I had against that little bit.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000 It still should stay in house.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000 It should be rolled down,
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000 but you know what I'm saying?
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000 Yeah.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.000 I don't, you know,
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000 I can give you a ranger handbook.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000 Can you can find out exactly how those guys are going to fight.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000 What their methods are, everything.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000 And another thing I've talked about
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000 on here is when you have doctrine,
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000 and you get tasks with something that's not the doctrine,
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000 you get confused.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000 You know, what to do.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000 Yeah, that's one of the, that's one of the reasons I think seal teams have been very successful
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000 in the recent past and even in the, even in the longer past is because
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000 we didn't have a book to look at.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000 We had to figure out how to do it.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000 And so no matter what the mission is,
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000 we always had a fresh look at it in the,
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000 we adapt.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000 We're in North of the Docks, we adapt.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000 I mean,
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.000 you know,
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000 our guys,
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000 if you had pulled a platoon right out of Vietnam and put them in
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000 the water.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000 You know,
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000 I know you wouldn't have been lost in the sea.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000 You know,
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000 you know,
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000 you wouldn't have been lost in sea.
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.000 You know,
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000 because it's the principles of the same,
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000 the same principle that you guys taught me was the same thing we did over there.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000 We'd have figured it out.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.000 Cover,
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000 move,
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000 take the high ground.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.000 Yeah,
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000 we would have figured out,
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.000 but,
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000 you know,
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000 we didn't have overwatches.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000 There's something like that.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000 When it's a pitch target night,
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000 you know,
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000 working a way through real quiet,
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000 not making a lot of noise.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000 Everything you do is for,
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 you know,
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000 being silent or just like,
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000 you guys never have to do things like,
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000 you know,
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 hit a real taunt line,
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 the point scout did,
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000 who had stepped over and grabbed the guy behind him,
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000 bring his hand down,
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000 show him where that wire was.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000 And he had stepped over the wire,
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000 he had put his,
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000 layover,
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000 grabbed the guy behind him,
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 and that's how we got across until we got everybody across and got a head count.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000 They wouldn't move on.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000 That's just when we trapped stuff.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000 You know what I mean?
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000 We,
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000 that's just,
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000 and you didn't,
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 you couldn't see it was pitch black.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000 That's why we have the guys hand,
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000 showed him where it was.
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000 And if it's a tie one,
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000 you don't cut it.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000 If it's all loose and stuff,
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.000 then yeah,
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000 cut it.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.000 So,
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000 how would the wood,
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000 how would the plant man see that?
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000 Yeah,
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.000 yeah,
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000 what they called,
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000 we used,
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000 you take a,
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000 a,
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000 a twig,
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.000 a long,
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000 a string on the real,
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000 no,
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000 no string on it.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000 But just like a fish and pull,
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000 and you just run that up and down like that,
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000 when moved and you'd feel it,
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000 just like you would,
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000 if you got a trout or a bite,
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000 and then you work your hand down,
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000 you reach over there and feel,
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000 and see what that is.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Yeah.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000 And ninja.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000 Yeah.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000 You know what the other,
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000 the other interesting thing that,
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000 when you started talking about,
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000 sealed him and going out at night time,
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000 and how that was all,
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000 on orthodox and people were doing it,
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000 is the opposite of when we were in the body,
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000 we started going out the daytime.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000 And the reason we started going out the day,
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000 there was a bunch of reasons why we started going out the day time,
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000 but one of the main reasons was the enemy,
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000 knew that we owned the night.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000 We had night vision,
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:56.000 we had that,
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000 we,
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000 we owned the night.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000 And so they didn't want to go out at night.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 And today,
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.000 when out daytime,
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 that's when they felt planted their ideas,
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000 it's when they killed people,
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000 that's what,
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000 and so we went out the daytime,
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000 because that's where the bad guys were out.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000 Well,
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.000 yeah,
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000 daytime and bed,
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000 and I'm two years ago,
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000 sleeping and hammocks and shared with rats,
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000 moping because we knew there had been out of night doing shit,
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000 so we wanted to talk to them.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000 You know,
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000 just like a rules of engagement shit,
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000 when we got my last platoon,
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000 we stopped in Saigon,
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000 and went to Mac for a V in our LT got his orders.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000 His orders were pacified,
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000 the Van Long Province.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Wow.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000 That was his orders.
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000 Pacified the Van Long Province.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000 Roger that.
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000 And that's where we went off and did it.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000 You know,
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000 no rules of engagement,
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000 nothing just pacified,
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000 and then there was like,
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000 okay.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000 Yeah.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000 That's that.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000 And we didn't work for the Army,
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000 Navy,
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000 Marines or anybody.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000 We were all in the,
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000 so if you'd been the old till the day of Jockel,
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000 you'd have,
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000 you'd have the con.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000 We would have a con.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000 Matter of fact,
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 we were at Don Tam,
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000 they had an able base here,
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000 and then the big Army base here at Don Tam.
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000 They had a stay on the Vietnamese Navy base,
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000 in between them,
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000 because the Navy didn't really want us on their base.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000 Plus their boats are right down there on the work,
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000 so it worked out perfect,
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000 you know what I mean?
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000 You go to the Army to,
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000 you know,
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000 test our West side,
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000 and check stuff.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000 Yeah,
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000 and they were doing that all the time,
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000 so it wasn't like,
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000 you know what I mean?
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000 It wasn't anything unusual, you know what I mean?
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000 So,
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000 going back now,
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000 you get back from your first deployment with UDT.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000 You go to the C.L.T.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000 and you show up,
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 you're going through the train.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000 What was the,
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:35.000 what was the,
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000 you kind of talked to me a little bit about this before,
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000 but how are you getting treated?
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000 Because you got,
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000 you got wounded on your first deployment as a UDT.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 So here you are,
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000 your combat veteran,
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 you've been in the shit,
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000 you've been wounded.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000 We call it a day at Kong and Cheeman,
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000 not that.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000 So,
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000 so you show up at C.L.T.1.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000 You're kind of like,
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.000 hey,
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000 I'm a experienced veteran.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000 I've been through the shit.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000 And that means shit.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000 And they just,
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000 the guys there,
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000 how they treat you.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000 Well,
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000 I mean,
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000 all right,
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000 just the same.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000 I mean,
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000 I had a trip with UDT,
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000 but just about everybody
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000 that went into C.L.T.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000 came out of UDT,
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000 11 or 12 into C.L.T.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000 You know what I mean?
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 Back in the day,
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000 before they started bringing them right into a seal team,
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000 the new guys,
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000 you know?
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 So it wasn't any different to the guys there.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 You just had to learn.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000 I mean,
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000 you know,
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 when I was in UDT,
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 I'd tell you,
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000 I wish they really wanted to go.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 Like when we were at Donknam,
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 that was during the 67,
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000 68,
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000 and we got a call that the East Coast for
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Tuning,
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000 the Meetall,
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000 which wasn't too far away from Donknam,
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000 was being overran,
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000 literally they were up in a tall building,
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000 so they held out real good.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000 They were the tallest building,
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000 and they had a 57,
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000 and they called us,
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000 and you can hear the VC coming up
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000 the stairways that throw grenades down and shit like that.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000 And they needed some help,
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 and they were about 17 of us down on that
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000 dark patrol on the USS Benoelle,
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000 right by Donknam,
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000 and we begged our lieutenant,
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000 down let us go in there.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000 We'd have been fucking killed.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000 Our heart was there,
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000 but we didn't have the IED training,
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000 media reaction,
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000 you know,
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.000 I mean,
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000 none of that shit.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.000 I mean,
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000 we'd have been.
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000 It would have been stupid,
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000 so oldies,
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000 our lieutenant said,
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.000 no,
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000 we hated him,
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.000 you know,
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000 then I got back and went to a
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000 cadre or SQT
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 and did all that stuff,
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000 and then deployed next time I saw John Odech,
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000 I hugged him,
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.000 I said,
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000 you're just one smart son of a bitch,
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000 dude.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000 Our heart was there,
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000 you don't have to be,
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000 but UDT,
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000 you just weren't trained to operate on land.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000 You didn't have the,
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000 the pre-risk,
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000 get skills that you learn
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000 and then you're going to be
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000 in the SQT and stuff, you know what I mean?
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000 And you get more of that even in
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Buds now than we ever got,
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000 because we were trying to be a frogman,
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000 that was it.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000 I mean,
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000 our last,
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.000 uh,
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000 off we did at San Camini Island,
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000 who was,
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000 we swim or scouted in by
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000 Birdshet Rock,
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000 and I can tell you,
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000 did you know,
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000 I'm talking about,
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000 they gave us 40 pounds of demo,
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000 have a sack,
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000 we went 26 miles down
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000 the other end of the island,
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000 blew up a target,
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000 and came 26 miles back
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000 and attacked the camp,
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000 guys as we were
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000 patrolling,
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000 that ambushes,
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000 and then pick out guys that
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000 been killed pretty soon,
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000 we were all followed down,
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000 they'd go,
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 God damn it,
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000 would tell you who we shot,
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000 then they'd get to go back to
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000 camp and defend it when we came back
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000 and attacked it.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000 But it was still just a demo
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000 raid, you know what I mean?
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000 It wasn't anything,
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.000 uh,
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000 patrolling real good,
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000 patrolling tactics,
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000 and all that stuff that you learn.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000 You don't mean,
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000 I mean,
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000 like I went out with the Australian SAS
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000 in a newly-de-edit,
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000 and did a week out in the field,
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000 I was a week,
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000 or was it two weeks?
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Was this when you were at Team One,
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000 or at Team One?
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000 My second but tuned,
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000 two of us,
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000 we had the Aussies come down and work with us,
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000 and they loved it,
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000 and we went up to Newy Dept,
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000 and I was just 60 guy,
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000 we went up and went out with them,
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000 we did a 10 day patrol with them,
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000 resupplying all this,
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000 if they never talked,
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000 said one word,
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000 that hope a patrol is all hand in arm signals,
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000 that's awesome,
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000 and they would get an LUP at night,
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000 everybody with their feet out,
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000 and you'd land on your pat,
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000 have your weapon right,
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000 actually pull what they call the silky up,
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000 and you'd go to sleep,
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000 when we didn't sleep for about two nights,
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000 because that's when we usually went out and worked,
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000 then we started to,
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000 because the way they figured it,
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000 there was an arulnois area,
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000 and somebody in that circle would be awake,
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000 and if we got sprung or something,
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 then you have 360 degree firepower,
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000 and we got out of there.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000 But they were the best I've ever seen,
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000 I've been to, I went to Army Ranger School,
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000 a radar group school,
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000 and everything in that one 10 day patrol
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000 of the Australians,
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000 I learned more about reconnaissance,
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000 and I did anywhere, anywhere.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000 We used to have guys from that say,
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000 that's come to come to Team I,
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000 that's metaphor, yeah.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000 They did,
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000 we had that program for a long time,
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000 but the last guy we had there was an officer,
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000 and he was worth the ship,
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000 but some of the sergeants we had.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000 The guys that, that were there when I showed up,
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000 were really square-to-wear guys that definitely had their field craft down.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000 Oh, they're so good.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000 That's what I was trying to say.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Yeah, a field craft.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000 We did, and UDT,
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 you just didn't have the field craft
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000 beyond the jungle looking for people,
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000 and shit, you know,
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000 that's why in UDT 13,
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000 some of the guys got killed,
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000 stuff down trails,
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000 and shit like that,
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000 they didn't, you know what I mean?
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000 Got it kind of heavy,
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000 shit together a little bit.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000 Yeah.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000 So you go,
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000 go through the cadre training,
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000 you check into your platoon,
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000 and it's time to go into point,
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000 are you flying out of North Island?
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000 Yeah, we fly out of North Island,
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000 and my first platoon,
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000 we flew into
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000 Camron Bay,
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000 and then took choppers down to a place called
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000 New Namcan,
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000 which is the very southern part of South Vietnam,
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000 right by a place that called the UDT in Forest.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000 It needed to do some turnover-offs
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000 with the other platoons that were there.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000 No turnover-offs.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000 We didn't at that time.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000 Matter of fact, most of our officer,
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000 dark boardoffs,
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000 yeah, we heard of those.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000 That's where you put a map behind you,
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000 choosing one of the guys in the platoon.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000 You saw a dark behind you,
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000 where that dark hits is where you're going to go into.
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Because we didn't have intel,
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000 we didn't have shit,
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000 we were pretty isolated,
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000 we were in a Vietnamese base camp,
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000 and BFE-Jep,
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 you know what I mean?
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 So that's how we went out.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000 Is it what you do in helicopter insert or a river insert?
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000 All river in,
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000 and actually out of a
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000 new Namcan where we were,
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000 would take sand pans out,
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000 because we didn't even have any MST support or anything.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000 The guys down at Seaflow did,
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000 which is a ways of way from the entire other squad was there.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000 And finally, they pulled us out of new Namcan,
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000 because we weren't,
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 we were doing stuff,
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 but it wasn't,
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000 wasn't effective.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 It wasn't real strategic.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000 So they brought us down to Seaflow,
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000 then we started getting some good ups down there.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000 They didn't want those ups like.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000 We still did river inops,
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000 like we went down to a place called Square Bay,
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000 and because we heard there was a prison
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000 or work camp and stayed down there for about three days.
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000 Watching this trails,
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000 seeing if we can see him moving and stuff like that.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000 We'd do ambushes,
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000 we'd get intel from our Navy Nile,
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000 which still wasn't that good.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000 Oh, one of the things in 1969,
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 that was first of the tunes in 1969,
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000 was we landed at New Namcan,
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000 got her stuff off the old 46th of the land in it,
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000 there and put it in the bunker,
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000 and then this little load came in and landed,
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000 you know,
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000 no, I don't know his name,
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000 he was a prude guy in that province,
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000 that we were in down there.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000 So he came in and told us,
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 you guys need anything,
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000 just let us know,
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000 and this is that load to left.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 We got mortar for about an hour and a half.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 So we told him never to come there again,
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000 because they knew what that load to it.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 He was a prude,
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.000 you know,
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000 that was a prude guy.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000 Now,
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000 that was a great guy.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000 But,
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.000 yeah,
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000 and he was a prude and long hair,
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000 you know, bearded, you know.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000 It's a little,
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000 the tune set up was,
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000 yeah,
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000 an OIC and a OIC,
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000 a Petune Chief and an LPL kind of like what you'd run.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Well,
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000 what we'd ran into.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000 And two squads.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000 The LPL,
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000 and just like what you'd do.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000 Just the same one,
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000 exactly,
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000 yeah.
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000 And then we broke it down,
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000 you know,
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.000 to mean,
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000 yeah,
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000 you're like,
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000 I was with the A OIC.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000 And the last Petune I was in was with,
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000 was with,
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000 was my A OIC.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000 Really?
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 Yeah.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Well, you know,
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000 that was,
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000 when was that 89?
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000 Damn.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000 Yeah.
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000 Yeah,
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000 that's awesome.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000 But he was,
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000 I must be at fun.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.000 Yeah,
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000 he was a great guy.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000 Awesome.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000 But I'm just saying he was easy.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 A OIC was the OIC.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000 Yeah.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.000 So,
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000 We had the LPL would work with him.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000 And then I would,
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000 you know,
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000 I have,
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000 you know,
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000 the kind of guy he was,
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000 I was a senior kid.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000 And that's awesome.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Yeah.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000 That's awesome.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000 I don't know if you knew anything.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 I don't know if you knew anything.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000 I don't know if you knew anything.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000 Yeah.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.000 Yeah.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000 They're all in my platoon.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000 Yeah.
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000 With my radio and horse radio,
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000 whatever had my life,
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000 you know.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.000 Yeah.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000 I could imagine.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000 Oh, you know,
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000 I could tell you,
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000 yeah.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Guess you never carried a radio on the team.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000 Really?
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000 You never carried a radio?
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.000 No,
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000 It's a 60-gunner day.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000 Two-way media appeal.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000 Then I went to the M14.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000 I like the 76-2 round.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000 Yeah.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.000 That's the,
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000 that's kind of the same.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000 When I went to the rescue team,
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000 they told us if you're not carrying a,
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000 I didn't 14.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000 You're wrong.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000 Yeah.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:35.000 Oh, yeah.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000 That's a great weapon.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000 It's accurate.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000 It's perfect.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.000 I love the game.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000 And guys,
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000 even a bunch of guys were a body carry the M14 as well.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000 Yeah.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000 Because they're shooting, you know, you shoot at vehicles, you shoot,
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000 you shoot, you do buildings shooting.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000 And they put the,
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000 the,
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000 our AP rounds in there.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000 And just,
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:50.000 Yeah.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000 That we don't got some.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000 You can,
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000 you can dig through some stuff.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Yeah.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 We did sexual supply month.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000 And I did three deployments.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 I did,
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000 1969.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000 I was in,
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000 Keyloplotoon.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000 And then came back from that.
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000 Then I actually got out for a year and a half.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000 Because I was married.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000 And my wife talked me to get now.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000 So I did.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000 And I did work for the phone company as a cable splacer.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000 He did everybody and everything.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000 We lived in Coronado.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000 So I'd go down the trade winds and all my buddies would tell me.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000 What great trips are having and stuff.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000 And I just went, you know,
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000 What year was that?
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000 That was,
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000 see,
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000 so we said we won.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 That was going to go back to the 69.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 So when you got back in 69,
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000 you got out for a year and a half.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000 Well,
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000 about a year,
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000 maybe not quite a year and a half.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000 But I went back in and gotten another platoon.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Luckily,
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000 you went to Vietnam again,
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000 771.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000 And I had.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000 Guys like that.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 That was a great platoon.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000 There was that always out there.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000 You and LPO that, too?
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000 No, I was so excited.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000 We were just 60 together getting after.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000 Yeah, exactly.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000 Yeah.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000 There was that was early difference between that first seal
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000 deployment to Vietnam.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Yeah, I was really happy with the first deployment.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000 Because we just didn't do a lot.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000 I mean, it was okay.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000 We did some stuff.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000 But it wasn't my idea of what it should be.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000 You know, it's a seal.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000 You know what I'm saying?
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Oh, yeah.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000 And then it was better when I got down to seafood.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000 But it's still, you know,
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000 I mean,
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000 but that second platoon,
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000 that's the one that kept me in the Navy.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000 You know,
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000 they were just,
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:25.000 you know,
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000 we're band brothers.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:27.000 You know,
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I mean,
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000 we were so close.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000 I was unbelievable.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.000 I mean,
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000 I love those guys.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000 The difference in what you did was
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000 the missions that you got tasked with is
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000 that the platoon commander kind of set things up
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000 so that he had a better vision of what to do and what to get after.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000 Absolutely.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000 I was in my second platoon.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000 That guy was just unbelievable.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000 I mean,
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000 he was just really really good.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000 Our first platoon,
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000 it was.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000 He was kind of nuts.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000 We didn't like him.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000 Like one time we're all clean our weapons on seafood.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000 And everything.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000 And what we used to come back when up is gravel line.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000 And then you jump in the water and let it wash all the mud off.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000 Yeah.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000 Well, he grabbed the line jumped in.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000 We had music roll out and
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000 clean our weapons in the shed.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000 Well, the line wasn't tied off right.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000 So he just started going on the river.
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000 But they saw him in the watch tower and said,
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000 man overboard and what he got.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000 You know,
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000 something that something that we talk about
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000 on here and up some of experience
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000 is having blue on blue situations take place.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000 Yeah.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000 And it's really hard for people to understand how it happens.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000 But I know that you had,
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 you had one of those happen.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000 You want to kind of give a quick debrief on that.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000 Yeah.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000 We're about ready to go home.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000 We had new platoon come in.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000 They wanted to do a break and up,
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000 not mentioning names of the officers,
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000 but they wanted to do a hammer and a handle off,
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000 which you just don't do with a brand new platoon.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000 And would been there,
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.000 you know,
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 we had our stuff together pretty well in that area.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 But what it was was we were supposed to push
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000 these bad guys to the VC into these guys that were in a tree line.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 And they inserted it to the wrong place to start with.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000 So when we started working our way in,
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000 we kind of came up to this tree line word ended
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000 a rice patty.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000 And then there was another tree line.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000 I couldn't give you the,
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000 it was a halfway decent ways away.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000 You know what I'm saying?
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000 But we had three kick cars and scouts with us.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000 Kick cars and scouts were north of the enemies that had,
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000 gave,
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000 turned over to the south enemies and they put them in camps.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000 And they called them two holy camps,
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000 basically.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000 And what we would do is we'd go to these camps.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000 And we would get these guys that new our area that we're working in.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000 And through an interpreter and stuff,
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000 we'd brief them everything.
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000 And they'd come and work with us.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000 And they'd work with us for a couple of offs till they became kind of trusted agents.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000 And they were pretty good, and most of them were not north enemies.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000 The VC that were good fighters.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000 And then we lived to the,
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000 the whole nine yard, we paid them.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000 We had money from now for a baby.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000 They gave us a lot of money to pay these guys and stuff.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000 So they weren't doing it just for free.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000 You know, because they needed money for their families.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000 And I don't know,
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000 a toss of these that happened to their families is one of the reasons.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 They two holy and came to our,
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000 to the south enemies side.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000 Anyway, we had three of those guys coming out in front of us.
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000 Blackwood, Jammer's, 1847's.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000 Looks just like VC, you know.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000 So the brand new Patoon saw three guys coming out of the tree line that
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000 were VC, so they opened up on them.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000 killed two of them and wounded together.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 And we swung off to the left.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000 And laid down.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000 And they were shooting sections and stoneers that us.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000 But shit was just falling under her heads because they were shooting high.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000 Like, you guys generally do before you.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000 And then it was a pretty new brand new guys in that little tune.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000 You know, they weren't experienced in shit normally.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000 You walk in me and whatever.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000 You know, so we're yelling the radio,
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000 cease fire, cease fire.
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000 And we had our officer that was where this got upon his knees.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000 It's you back and then my gun shot through the heart.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000 And we finally got him to stop.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 And then we got him out of there.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000 He was dead though.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000 He shot right to the heart.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000 You know.
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 That was a blue and blue thing.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000 That was pretty bad.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 And that was right before you went home.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 Yeah.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000 Yeah, the confused that happened to us.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 It was called a breaking up.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000 You know, like I say the new that the new platoon had about two guys.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000 I think their LPO can't remember his name.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000 And then was with me on that beat where we got shot.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000 He was also on my train class.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000 He was either the OEC or AAC on it.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000 But most of us and we're all brand new guys.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000 You know, I mean, good training.
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000 Everything, but you know, this is their first song.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000 God damn, we're in a firefight.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000 You know what I mean?
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000 Yeah.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:58.000 We have to be the opportunity to slowly work into the combat situations.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000 You know, do a smaller patrol, do an easier patrol.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000 That's what we normally did.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Yeah.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000 If you're not kind of overwrite your officers that you got.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000 You know, taking them out in the daytime.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000 That was a daytime off either way.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000 But usually it's just to kind of get them or in any way to the environment.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000 What they're going to be.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000 And then we all had these.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000 I don't know if we had one in 69, but 771.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000 We had these barn dance files.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000 And every off we went on we put a synopsis in this barn dance.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000 So if you were going to go in that same area, you could pull out that barn dance file and read it and see what the guys that's seen there.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000 Enemy.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000 What the train was like on and on.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000 You know what I mean?
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.000 Mm-hmm.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000 It was that was pretty good.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Real good.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000 And almost every platoon had those from previous platoons all the way up to you.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000 So you can kind of get an idea of what you're going into.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000 If you didn't have intel on that area.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000 What are some of the leadership you talked about your second platoon being super tight super close?
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000 What were some of the leadership characteristics that you saw from the platoon chief and the platoon commander that as you look back.
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000 You recognize that those were really good traits that really brought everyone together.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000 Well, was our chief.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000 He made senior chief.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000 He had been over about three times.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000 And it was just very easy going.
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000 But very sharp and he understood things really well.
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Our LPO was Gary Smith.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000 She just Smith.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000 And he had been a screwdriver in that province.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000 So as far as getting intel on all of our other sides, it was perfect.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000 And then, I wouldn't say much about him.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000 But our L.T.
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000 He was out.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 And he went on almost every up.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000 In fact, one time, he burned his hand with a smoker.
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000 And we're still going to go out.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000 He was going to go out with us.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000 He just had his hand wrapped up and shed.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000 So he has over the office club on the Navy side eating.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000 And the officers send your hands all.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000 Benny's up and said, you're still going out.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000 He says, yeah, I think you've buy my guys.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000 I'm dead anyway.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000 But he was really good.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000 He had his head on his shoulders.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000 Figured out things.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 Quick thinker.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000 You know what I mean?
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000 And it was just a neat.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000 He was just good.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000 And how about, I mean, you know, we always obviously hear now.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000 Veterans get treated great now.
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000 I mean, from the Afghan war in Iraq war, we get treated really great by.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000 For the most part, by America and by the public, we get treated really well.
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000 Compared to what you guys had to deal with and Vietnam.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000 Well, how much of that did you see when you'd come home?
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000 Was it, I mean, Coronado is a pretty pro Navy town.
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000 I mean, in San Diego, it's a pretty pro Navy town.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 Was it the same way back then?
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Was it relatively pro Navy?
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000 Or did you see some of the, some of the hippies and whatnot coming on?
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000 And it had some demonstrations sometimes.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000 You know what I mean?
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000 Like downtown San Diego.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000 But not much.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000 And we basically just hung out here in San Diego or to other bars that we knew.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000 We'd fly out on North Island, fly in on North Island.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000 It wasn't like we were flying in the San Francisco or something.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000 So we didn't get hit with that real real heavily.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000 You know what I mean?
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.000 And if we did have issues that are bar some of our, we usually skirted away pretty quick.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000 You know, so it wasn't really a problem.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000 We didn't really our guys here.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000 These ghost guys that don't know, our guys here.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000 We didn't really have everything.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000 I'll tell you an opto in 69.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000 We, we're going up this one canal and we used the,
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000 PBR's couldn't get up it.
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.000 So we had to take a Boston way to wrap it with a twin-six season of front and one guy would set and steer the steer it.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000 You know, we would take a squad up there.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000 Maybe five guys, you know, and whatever squad didn't have the opto night,
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000 they got to be the driver in the gunner,
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000 which I got to be the driver once and I wasn't happy.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000 I covered myself with flag jackets.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000 I mean, who's anybody going to shoot at?
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000 Oh yeah.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000 So we were going up real slow up this thing and all kinds of,
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000 filament lines and stuff like that that were cut in our cell suit.
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Because it was low tide.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Luckily it wasn't high tide.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000 You know what I mean?
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000 Yeah.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000 So we got up there and, and put the guys in and we came back out in the PBR said,
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000 what the boats into a bank right?
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000 So we're sitting there on the PBR me and my buddy that was the gunner, another seal.
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000 And I was sitting across this river.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 We were just pup pup pup pup pup.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 It was the sandpan.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 So we're going to go after it's some bitch.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.000 But one guy driving, one guy in the 60, we need a guy with that could see too.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000 You know what I mean?
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000 Because you, you know.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000 So we asked one of the PBR guys, you know, who wants to go with us.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000 And this whole time we've been with him and God damn we'd love to go with you guys.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000 The only guy on that boat that volunteered was the guy that was married.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000 Yeah.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000 The rest of wouldn't do it.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000 So we jumped his sandpan.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000 One after the other one, hose them down.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000 They hit the bank.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000 And then there was blood trails going into the killed one of them.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000 He was laying in the boat and the other guy had gotten out and ran.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 And he could see blood spots, you know, following them.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 Well, we didn't go after him.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000 We're not that stupid.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000 You know, nighttime.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000 You know, he's probably dying.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000 Yeah, I'll take these fuckers.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000 Guys out with me.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000 Sorry we brought the sandpan back and God damn we had a big thing of intel.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And weapons and all kinds of shit.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000 And the other guys that we went up and got the other guys bought them out.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000 They didn't do a thing.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000 You know, it's pretty neat.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000 That's sketchy.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000 Yeah.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:42.000 I can't imagine the, that you guys would just go buy these filament wires and step over these trip wires
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 and just continue on your mission.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000 That's sketchy.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000 Yeah, after.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000 So what you, you know, it's what we did anyway.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000 So I wasn't on this off.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000 But it was that, you know, a couple of the guys from the other squad went down to square bay.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000 And we'd gotten this intel that the sandpan pretty good size one.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.000 Almost like a junk would go up the river at nighttime up the main river where seafood was up by that way.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000 You know, so George and those guys were down there.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:18.000 They were again, we're in a Boston way, they had a couple of law rockets with them and stuff like that.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000 You know, so they figured we'll shut.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000 We haven't really been a dry hole here.
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000 We had that goddamn, the junk when it comes by, you know.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000 So they go out after the junk and they could hear it and then see the silhouette of it.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:43.000 You know, so they got real close to it and fires a, fires a law rocket and hit the stern, not the exact rudder and everything.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Then popped a flare so they could shoot and everything.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000 And well, after they popped their flare about 15 other flares popped and it wasn't there us.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:01.000 So behind it was all the sort of short-tell of sand pans and shint and so they took off and we're shooting back with their stone or in 60 and stuff like that.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000 Finally they called and then a couple of PBRs came down and saved them.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000 That was a pretty good off.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000 That's, that's just so that's one of the major differences, you know, with us having night vision now.
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000 The way that you guys had to utilize illumination and we did, we did utilize illumination for time at the time.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000 We actually, on big, big operation sometimes we'd have the army firing of the army.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000 Artillery would be firing illumination in certain situations, but generally we weren't doing that.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000 Yeah, the damn bushes were always fired a flare up, they ought to get the good vision.
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000 Yeah, well, we had them. We got out of there.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000 You know, put a claymores out and claymores behind us.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000 You know, me and everything sat there and put dudes that come down the river and then we had them.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:51.000 You know, and then, so you get, you get back from from your second torn view.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000 And I'm in, is that the warrant, right? I mean, this is pretty much it was.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000 In fact, a platoon that was that Ben Luck, which was 40 miles away from us.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000 They were only over there for three months and they came back to.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000 So we were the last four to point deployed platoon in Vietnam.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000 There was no member platoon.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:17.000 Was it Chief, like he said, a sponge a great guy's not platoon?
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000 In, in, I mean, at that time there was a couple hundred guys at Silti-1.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000 I think there was about maybe, and it boosted up real high.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000 So there might have been 250.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000 I think there was only about 150 when I got into the,
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000 I don't know, if the big push had started yet to build more guys up.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000 It wasn't a lot. You knew everybody.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000 I mean, it was a pretty tight, tight group.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000 You want to get one guy that we both know, he told me when he checked in the Silti-1 back then.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000 He was like taking a shower after PT and like every guy was shot up.
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Like you could just see what every guy was, you know, you could see scars and they're armed,
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000 leg, swoomed in.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000 Did you, did you, did you, what a lot of guys stay in it at that time?
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000 A lot of guys do a couple of tunes.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000 I think after the, no, most of the guy stayed in, that's what we did.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000 That's what we loved. And then after the war, yeah, we had a pretty good,
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000 access to some people getting out.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000 And when they get out because there was nothing to do, you know,
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000 that's what they were doing. That was there, you know, there's nothing else.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000 I mean, what are you going to do, you know,
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000 and I think in, because I just like the guys, I like all we did, you know,
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000 when I was over at Buds, I come back in 1971 and then went over to Buds as an instructor.
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000 And I got bored doing that. So there was this guy called,
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000 I'll tell you, I would not want to be a student when you are bored as a Buds instructor.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000 I was a nice guy there.
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000 Anyway, so, I went, buddy, Doll was in UDT,
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000 he's a little bit of guy from Colorado and he was a rodeo rider, right?
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000 So he talks me in the going out this place called Burton,
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000 which is out by, wasn't like sign. It was Lemon Valley,
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000 Lemon Grove. Lemon Grove. Yeah. And there was a place called Burton's out there.
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000 And it was just all bulls, but they were dinks. They weren't real.
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000 You rode your bulls, you know. So I went out there and,
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000 hell, I liked it. Never got bucked off there. So I went rodeo and went to IRA
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000 and PRCA.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000 And actually thought about getting out of the Navy to ride rodeo because I loved it.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000 But then I got bored because rodeo bulls are, I rode bulls.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000 They're the last of the event, right?
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000 Yeah.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000 So I started riding Bearback in South of Orange.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:42.000 But I got stepped on, well, I got 22 stitches in my left side of my face,
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000 14 in the back of my head, and had both my shoulders dislocated.
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000 When it was a god-goard, then I got stepped on and had five buss,
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000 the ribs and punctured along. So I figured, okay, that's enough.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000 I quit doing that and just ate in the teams, you know.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000 The teams are safe for the rodeo ride.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000 Yeah, that was over over a year and a half, almost two years.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000 Yeah.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000 Yeah.
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000 What about guys? I mean, how were guys doing as far as handling what they've seen
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000 and coming back and all of a sudden they're in Main Street?
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000 Dude, we didn't have that problem.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000 I mean, I'm telling you, the guys that were crazy were crazy before they went on.
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000 I didn't see that.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000 They weren't, I mean, I know all my buddies and in fact,
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000 Thursday, this Thursday night, we have that UDT, Vietnam UDT seal,
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000 get together and Thursday night talk those guys.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000 You don't see, but you know, I've got to go to the hospital and mentally owned.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000 Not that I know if I tell you.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000 There may be, it did happen, but the only guy I know that really got affected
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000 was he was with that one platoon.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000 I can't think of him.
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000 And they were taking a part of Mortar in the mortar blew up.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000 And he had just left to have a cigarette and all his buddies got killed by that Mortar
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000 and stuff including the guy named who was just a superb guy.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000 And he wasn't quite the same after that.
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000 And I can understand that.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000 I mean, not, you know what I mean?
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000 But just being the firefights and shit like that and stuff that happened.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000 But you know, we just, it was the way I was.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000 And even when you, even when you got out for the first, so then you did,
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000 you did 30 years in the Navy.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000 And you know, that was another funny thing when you, when I talked about earlier
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000 when you, when you graded our, you laying graded me for the first time.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000 I don't know how old you were.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000 It was 1993, maybe 1993 or you.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000 I was in, uh, alfoutoon at team one with, uh,
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000 and I'm going to, yeah, I was a good off.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000 Yeah, but you were, I don't know how old you were in that time period.
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000 But, you know, for, for my perspective, you were like 170 years old, right?
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000 And I'm thinking about yourself, hey, this guy's deal.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000 This is this Roger Aden.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000 And you're like putting on your wetsuit.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000 Okay, put on the wetsuit.
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000 I guess you're going to get in the water.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000 Get some water, swim in.
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000 Do the recolbs.
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000 I'm in with the recolon and then he swim back out.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000 Swim back out, you know?
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000 That was a good job.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000 That was such a good job to do.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000 If you're going to do orange, you've got to do them right.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000 You know, old pointy to point me.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000 Otherwise, you don't see everything, you know?
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000 And that's what I liked.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000 I was a warrant in.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000 But that's what I liked my last three or four years, three years,
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000 I think, in the, in the teams as I did a orange.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000 So you still got to have your feet on the ground of the boys, you know?
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000 It couldn't be an opportunity.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000 But that's what I wanted to do.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000 Yeah, there's nothing, there's nothing better than, uh,
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000 there's nothing better than the, uh, than the putoon life.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000 Now, I know that I know that you're short on time, and I,
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000 and I, I rushed this and, uh,
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000 I'm glad we were able to get a little bit done.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000 And I think maybe after after this one,
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000 we need to listen to it and, and I'll probably end up with a bunch more questions.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000 I know people that are listening to this,
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000 a bunch of team guys listening to this.
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000 They, they actually, a bunch of team guys sent me a bunch of questions.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000 I didn't get to any of them.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000 Yeah, we were, yeah, I know it's a, I'm sorry.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000 No, it's all good.
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000 It's all good. Yeah, things that pop up in your head when you talk about it.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000 I mean, I mean, there's a lot of, I mean, I was a,
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000 I was a frogman first, and they'll see, you know, see that.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000 Yeah, that was probably one of the best appointments ever had.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000 And that was great.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000 And Philopines is great.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000 And we were so glad to leave the Philopines and go back to the depth,
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000 just to get out of for a while, that he died, you know?
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000 So, uh,
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 we'll definitely get you back on here.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000 And like I said, next time I'll, I'll, I'll get some questions from the team,
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000 guys that, that they asked me to ask you and go through some of those.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000 But, thanks for coming on.
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000 I know like I said, I know you've never, never been out in the public eye before.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000 And I appreciate it.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000 And not only fought for freedom against the evils of communism,
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000 but also a established and passed on lessons learned for the current generation of war fighters.
