00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 263 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening. And this podcast is brought to you by you. That's right.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This podcast exists because of your support. And I've always dreaded having to say the words,

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
this podcast is brought to you by whatever. But we don't say that. And we're not going to say that.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We're here and we're able to do what we do because you support us in a bunch of different ways.

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And we own what we have here. And we don't rely on any companies to sponsor what we're doing,

7
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which is nice. I mean, other than the companies that we actually own.

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And the companies that we own, make the stuff that we actually use to do the things that we like to do.

9
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And listen, it is a harder road to take to harder road to take. You can go that eat, you can go,

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
you know, like just get that money. And there's been times.

11
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Some people that are on this podcast right now have sort of petitioned for that kind of thing.

12
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
A little bit right. Right.

13
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, and that's, you know, legitimately, because it's, it's a much harder move to try and build companies invest in your companies and run the supply chain and the personnel and deal with all the finances and the tax and the thousands of things that you got to do to make a business run.

14
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that's okay. Just what guess what it takes work takes hard work.

15
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It takes discipline because it's agranged. But at the end of the day, guess what?

16
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That discipline gives us freedom.

17
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Give us freedom. Freedom, freedom, the freedom to talk about whatever we want.

18
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The freedom to talk for five hours without having to take a break to mention some company.

19
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We don't have to do any that.

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And we can make, like I said, we can make the podcast as long as we want.

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The sure is we want to do whatever we want. We got the freedom to do that.

22
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We have the freedom to do that because we also have freedom of speech, which with the.

23
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
With the incredible foresight and intention.

24
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Is the first amendment of the constitution of the United States or America.

25
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The first amendment is Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of of religion or prohibiting the free exercise.

26
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people, peaceably to assemble and a petition.

27
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The government for a redress of grievances. So there you go.

28
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The government shall make no law to a bridge freedom of speech. Doesn't get any clearer than that.

29
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But it does get a little money or that in modern times, right?

30
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
They didn't have podcasts back in the day. That I'm aware of.

31
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So as smart as the founding fathers were, and as well as the constitution has held up as a document.

32
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Well, there's been there's the interesting things going on right now.

33
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Interesting thing is going on right now. And in some ways it's troubling.

34
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Because you see you can see speech being controlled.

35
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can see speech being censored. You can see meanings.

36
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The way speech is being used being manipulated.

37
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You can see words, the meaning of words being changed.

38
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And we've seen this before throughout history.

39
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And one of the best examples of this. It's a very clear example.

40
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And I just want to talk about with Jordan Peterson.

41
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And when Jordan was on, you weren't there.

42
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The second or third time that Jordan came on, you weren't there.

43
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But we, and it's actually happened with every time he's come on. We've had some, I've had some plan about what we're going to talk about.

44
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We don't talk about any that. We talk about something completely different.

45
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So on that one, we were going to talk about the Google Igarca Pelago and by Sorcerin Itson.

46
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we did cover this one thing that I really wanted to talk about.

47
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Because I think it's important. It's, it's an example of the way language drives,

48
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
thought and policy. And it's, it's the one word, it's the word is cool.

49
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And the, what that word originally meant was former sort of workers or peasants that had become wealthy.

50
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Right. So this person, they were, they were in the lower class and they moved up.

51
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And then over time it became a little bit more pejorative, meaning it had a, it started to take on a negative connotation.

52
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So eventually it became Sorcerin Itson in, in the Gulag, Arca Pelago.

53
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000
He says, quote, a, a, a, a cool act sort of became to represent a miserly dishonest, a rural trader who grows rich,

54
00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000
not through his own labor, but through someone else's. So it's, it's got a negative connotation connotation.

55
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But he says about those cool locks at the time that there wasn't that many of them.

56
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:21.000
In fact, he says that they could be numbered on one finger. So there's a very small number of these kind of bad people that had made money and kind of made money off the backs of others.

57
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:37.000
As the, as the revolution went on, the communist revolution went on, circa like 1950, 1960, 1970, the meaning of the word started to encompass more, more people.

58
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It started to, and this is again, this is from, this is from social nits.

59
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And it started to include people, all those who in any way hired workers, even if it was only when they were temporarily short of working hands in their own families.

60
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So you had something that used to just mean someone that had kind of risen up and made it out of the lower class, into the middle class.

61
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Then it became someone that made it to the middle class, but they did it in a bad way.

62
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And now it's, hey, anybody that's sort of anybody that's hired another person is cool.

63
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000
By the 1930s, social nits, and he says that the word was used to, quote, describe all strong peasants in general.

64
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:36.000
peasants strong in management, strong in work, or even strong merely in convictions. So you can see this word, which used to just represent a very small number of people.

65
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
All of a sudden it starts to represent more and more people if you have anyone working for you.

66
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And, and eventually an official decree comes out from the government.

67
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It releases an official definition of what a cool act is.

68
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And by that definition of cool act was any person who used hired labor owned a mill, a cremary processing equipment or a, quote, complex machine with a motor.

69
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So it's a mathematically rented out agricultural equipment or facilities or was involved in trade money lending commercial brokerage or other sources of non labor income.

70
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And this last definition made it so that anyone that sold surplus goods. So if you had extra stuff and you sold it, you're cool.

71
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So now we're basically now talking, you'd if you had a yard sale, right? So now we're basically talking about about everyone.

72
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And then the government set out to destroy the cool acts and thereby destroy the strength of the peasantry.

73
00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And the communist started a program called decoecasation.

74
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And then they started to get rid of them. The people that were identified as cool acts were, which again, now there's a ton of them.

75
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000
They were ordered to give their farm animals their livestock to government authorities. So now we're taking property.

76
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Many of them, and many of the cool acts at this time were like, okay, well then I'm going to kill my livestock and, you know, keep the meat and use the hides.

77
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And then when they try to kill the livestock instead of giving them up, the communist made a new law, which made it possible to prosecute people for the malicious slaughtering of livestock.

78
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
This is like, isn't it just you see the steps going and it gets worse and worse?

79
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So still left a little bit too a little bit, you could still maybe move through that. You could still probably get away with it.

80
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So then Stalin decreed in order to oust the cool acts as a class.

81
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The resistance of this class must be smashed in open battle and it must be deprived of the productive sources of its existence and development that is in turn towards the policy of eliminating the cool acts as a class.

82
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
We're going to get rid of all of them. And by the way, look at who we're talking about. We're talking about people that were talking about the people that had stepped up and made things happen, right?

83
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000
People that own machinery, people that own the mill, people that ran businesses. That's who they're talking about.

84
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Well, guess what? When you do that, when you get rid of the people that own farm equipment and farms and livestock, guess what happens?

85
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You run out of food. You don't have anyone making food anymore and this leads to starvation.

86
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And when you get starvation, now you get people that are hungry, now you get kind of a mob rule thing going on.

87
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And this is a very horrible thing to think about. If you weren't starving, if you weren't starving or your family wasn't starving, how could you not be starving?

88
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You would be, you would not be starving. If you had food, if you had food, guess what you were?

89
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
You're a cool act.

90
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.000
That's what you are. So what does mob rule look like when it is approved by the government or it's ignored by the government? What does it look like?

91
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
There's a description, an author named Robert Conquest, he wrote a book called Reflections of a ravaged century.

92
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And this is a description from that book, which is actually from a Russian journalist, Grossman, who said that the party activists who helped the state political directorate, the secret police, also known as the GPU, with arrests and deportations,

93
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:15.000
quote, were all people who knew one another well and knew their victims, but in carrying out this task, task they became dazed, stupified, they would threaten people with guns, as if they were under a spell, calling small children,

94
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:28.000
who lack bastards, screaming blood suckers, they had sold themselves on the idea that so-called cool acts were parrillas, on touchables, vermin.

95
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:40.000
They would not sit down at a parasites table, the cool act, a child was loathsome, the young cool act girl was lower than a mouse.

96
00:12:40.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Mob, scenario, the book goes on to quote a guy named Lev Copa Lev, a party activist, so this guy was in the communist game, who eventually became a dissident, and he said it was excruciating to see and hear all of this, and even worse, to take part in it.

97
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And I persuaded myself, explained to myself, I mustn't give into debilitating pity.

98
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
This is what he's telling himself, look, I can't have any pity.

99
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We were realizing historical necessity, we were performing our revolutionary duty, we were obtaining grain for the socialist fatherland, for the five-year plan.

100
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So, Stalin ends up ordering the cool acts to be liquidated as a class, which in turn causes the Soviet famine in 1932 and 1933, that results in at least 3 million dead,

101
00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and the social distance said 6 million. 1.8 million were sent to labor colonies, only 1.3 million ever actually made it to the labor colonies.

102
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Another half a million of them just disappeared gone, look, we don't even know what happened, but obviously didn't turn out good for them.

103
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And then you have the rest of the nightmare of the Soviet disaster.

104
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And you can pull that thread and you get to this language, you get to language, on a tack on language, on what people say,

105
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:56.000
what people are allowed to say, or what people are forced to say, because our words, they make our thoughts.

106
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000
We think in words, and we have to keep our words free to keep our minds free.

107
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And I thought that we learned this. And if it wasn't obvious enough from watching what happened in the Soviet Union, then when you read 1984 by George Orwell, by George Orwell, you said, oh, okay, yeah, got it.

108
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Didn't he spell it out for us? If you've ever read that book, at least when I went through I asked where you had to read that book.

109
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And at some point, at some point, I'm sure I will cover the whole book on the podcast.

110
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:54.000
But without even talking about the plot, just talking about the world that he paints in this, in this book.

111
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The book is, you know, it was written in the whatever, 1947 I think.

112
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
But it's about 1984, and you've got this. I'm the present government. You've got surveillance everywhere.

113
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Everyone's heard that the big brother, do you remember reading 1984? No, no.

114
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So it's a futuristic time. Everything is controlled by the government.

115
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You've heard big brothers watching you, right? That's where it comes from.

116
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Is it about his not a dystopian future? No, sorry. It's a reality show that everyone lives in this house.

117
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Yeah, it's a set. But here's a thing, no. It's dystopian. It's not dystopian.

118
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Well, I guess there's a far control. No, but there's cameras in every single room.

119
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I don't think they let me run a reality program. I think it's pretty weird.

120
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
But yeah, so they go around in the house and there's cameras like mounted cameras in all the rooms,

121
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
like surveillance cameras. It's interesting.

122
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And you can tune in on off times and stuff and just watch.

123
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Like you could do that. Like you could go on a website and just watch the people in the house.

124
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yeah, like I think they used to play it on show time where it's like big brother,

125
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
live and you can just tune in and watch them do nothing. Like do normal everyday stuff.

126
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
But here's the thing. There's I think there's now that's totally common, right? Because through the internet, you can just do that.

127
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
There's people doing that right now. Screen and scream are streaming there.

128
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Whatever they're doing their homework. I saw something,

129
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
some thing about, I think it was a Japanese dude who would like do his homework.

130
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
He was getting even a million people watching him. He was super organized. I'll give it up for him.

131
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But if I remember correctly, could you see the content of his homework?

132
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Yeah, he was different. It was like, there was multiple camera views. You could kind of see what he was reading.

133
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
You could see what he was working on. Yeah. And that's what he did. He did his homework or something like that.

134
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Okay, so that makes sense. If it was just a picture of him doing his homework,

135
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
you couldn't see the homework that's different. That's weird.

136
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
But if you can see what homework he's doing, oh yeah, that's good.

137
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Why is that? Not why are you more into. I'm not interested in his homework at all.

138
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Well, I mean pretty much. I'm not into video games either,

139
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
but you can watch people livestreaming their screen and a little corner of them.

140
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Their face playing just playing video games or whatever. And this is like multi million.

141
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
There's hundreds of people that watch those hundreds of millions per minute watching that stuff.

142
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Yeah. But it's different because big brothers like them doing normal stuff all day all night.

143
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That's a big brother like, but they have a voice in there too.

144
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Can you give directions? It says, hey, you're breaking this rule or you're who makes the rules?

145
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
The show or whatever. Are the rules or the rules tyrannical in any way?

146
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
No, it's a game show at the end of the day. It's like it lasts like a few months or whatever.

147
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I don't know how long and they, you know, they have little challenges.

148
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Defeat the opponents in challenges.

149
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
So you can break them.

150
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Yeah, and then you have a vote and it's like, you know, it's a thing.

151
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Yeah.

152
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Alright, well, that term big brother comes from 1984.

153
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
There's surveillance watching you all the time.

154
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:13.000
There's perpetual war going on. There's historical negation, which is when you falsify history or you distort history.

155
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And there's a bunch of just really, I was going to say cool quotes, whether or not cool.

156
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
They're actually horrible quotes, but they're, they're, they really capture what the book is about.

157
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And there's one saying in the book,

158
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past?

159
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
All these things in there when you read them, you go,

160
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
there's thought police who are tracking people for committing thought crimes.

161
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
There's people who commit thought crimes,

162
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
who, and they, or they don't tow the party line.

163
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
They don't, they don't tow the party line.

164
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And if you don't tow the party line or if you commit thought crimes,

165
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
you become an un-niperson,

166
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
meaning you just disappear, and all evidence that you ever existed is destroyed.

167
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
You are gone.

168
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
You become an un-person.

169
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
You get erased.

170
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
You get erased. You get canceled.

171
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Right? Sounds familiar, right? So you get canceled.

172
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Then this is crazy.

173
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
In 1984, in the book, there's something called the Pro feed.

174
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Short for the ProLiteriet feed,

175
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
which is a steady, unending stream of mindless entertainment,

176
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
which is produced to distract and occupy the minds of the masses.

177
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Is that sound familiar at all?

178
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So you can spend all this time distracted and wasting and being just mindlessly entertained.

179
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Yeah.

180
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Sounds like that video game scenario.

181
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Sounds like the thing you got in your pocket,

182
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
which by the way, gets even scarier.

183
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
They have something called a telescope screen.

184
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
You watch it, and it watches you.

185
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Kind of like your phone,

186
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
which is tracking where you are identifying what you're watching.

187
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Like your phone is watching you,

188
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
as much as you're watching it.

189
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Right? This is factual.

190
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
There's a word called a word called up sub,

191
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
which means you submit to the higher authority.

192
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
It's viewed in like a positive way.

193
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And then all these words,

194
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000
all these words are framed on a new evolving language,

195
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
which is called new speak.

196
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
So we have a new way of speaking.

197
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
It's called new speak.

198
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
The old way of speaking is called old speak.

199
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
That's English.

200
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
That's the English language is called old speak.

201
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
New speak is what we're talking now.

202
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And they got a bunch of these words.

203
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And we're going to get into the language of it.

204
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
But if you add plus as a prefix to any word,

205
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
it's strength and so word.

206
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
So good is good.

207
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Excellent. They get rid of the word,

208
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
excellent. They say plus good.

209
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Because they're trying to limit the vocabulary of people.

210
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And people have old think.

211
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
If people have old think,

212
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
they have ideas or they have memories

213
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
that are pre prior to the revolution.

214
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
So this is right.

215
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
This is scary to think about.

216
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
And I know we don't normally talk much about

217
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
current events really on this podcast.

218
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Because there's enough of that.

219
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Filling everyone's pro feet every single day

220
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
without us chiming in.

221
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I mean, you got pro feet coming at you 24,

222
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
seven thousand different angles.

223
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And so I'm not,

224
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
we don't spend a bunch of time talking about,

225
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
wait, what happened in the last,

226
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
you know, 12 hour new cycle.

227
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
But you know, the other day when we were talking to cowboy,

228
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
cowboy,

229
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
cowboy, con, the Vietnamese,

230
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
socks, orger,

231
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
gave me a little warning that I had to pay

232
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
some attention to.

233
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
You know, he was saying,

234
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
you know, you got to watch out for communism.

235
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And I kind of, you know,

236
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
a kind of brush that often said,

237
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
well, you know,

238
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
we're a strong country.

239
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We, we were rooted in freedom or something like that.

240
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And you know,

241
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
it's in our blood and we're remain free.

242
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And he kind of just said, be careful.

243
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Because he had seen it take over and Vietnam.

244
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And I mean, you want to talk,

245
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
you look at the history of the Vietnamese people.

246
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
You want to talk about rooted in freedom.

247
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Like that,

248
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
that country is legit.

249
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
They, they do not get.

250
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
They do not take easy to occupy us.

251
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
It's in their blood, freedom.

252
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And look what happened.

253
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It happened and it happens slowly.

254
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And you can see in the, like,

255
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
like in the Soviet Union,

256
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
one thing that happens is

257
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
it, part of it starts with speech.

258
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
It starts with banning words,

259
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
it starts with changing the meaning of words.

260
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And that's what happens in, in the book 1984.

261
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And there's all kinds of quotes in this book.

262
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
And they're,

263
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
they're just eerie.

264
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
They're eerie when you hear them.

265
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And you think about the context of the world right now.

266
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I, I, I blocked out some of the, some of the quotes.

267
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
If all others accepted the lie,

268
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
which the party imposed,

269
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
if all records told the same tale,

270
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000
then the lie passed into history and became the truth.

271
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
How about this one?

272
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We know that no one ever ceases power

273
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
with the intention of relinquishing it.

274
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Here's one.

275
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The ideal set up by the party was something huge,

276
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
terrible and glittering,

277
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines

278
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
and terrifying weapons,

279
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
a nation of warriors and fanatics,

280
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
marching forward in perfect unity,

281
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
all thinking the same thoughts and shouting,

282
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
the same slogans,

283
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
perpetually working, fighting,

284
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
triumphant,

285
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
per, triumphant,

286
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
persecuting,

287
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
300 million people all with the same face.

288
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Here's another interesting one.

289
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
How could you make appeal to the future

290
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and not a trace of you,

291
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper,

292
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
could physically survive?

293
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Another section every record has been destroyed or falsified.

294
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Every book rewritten,

295
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
every picture has been repainted,

296
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
every statue in street building has been renamed,

297
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
every date has been altered,

298
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
and the process is continuing day by day

299
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
and minute by minute.

300
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
History has stopped.

301
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Nothing exists,

302
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
except an endless present,

303
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
in which the party is always right.

304
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Another one,

305
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling,

306
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
everything will be dead inside you.

307
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Never again will you be capable of love,

308
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
or friendship, or joy of living,

309
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity,

310
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
you will be hollow.

311
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
We shall squeeze you empty,

312
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
and then we shall fill you with ourselves.

313
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And,

314
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
there's this book is just filled with these eerie,

315
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
eerie statements,

316
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
but in the end of the book,

317
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
the main character Winston, he finally breaks.

318
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Like he's resistant through the book,

319
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
and he's trying to maintain some level of humanity

320
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
and individuality in the end he breaks,

321
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
and it finishes up by saying,

322
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
but he was all right.

323
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
But it was all right.

324
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Everything was all right.

325
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
The struggle was finished.

326
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
He had won the victory over himself.

327
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
He loved a big brother.

328
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Very depressing.

329
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
It's very depressing when the human spirit is broken

330
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
and it's even more depressing when the human spirit is broken

331
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
on mass,

332
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
which is what this book portrays.

333
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And,

334
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
and George Orwell does a great job.

335
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
This whole, this whole,

336
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
this whole explanation and this trick,

337
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
and this thing that he does with language,

338
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
is very powerful.

339
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And it's calculated and it's deliberate,

340
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
which is,

341
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
which is the way it happens.

342
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And like I said,

343
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
one day,

344
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
I'm sure I'll cover this whole book,

345
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
but tonight,

346
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
I just wanted to cover one part of the book,

347
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
one part of the book that I want to dive into.

348
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
So, so George Orwell wrote the book.

349
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And he's got a very interesting past.

350
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I mean, he had a,

351
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
he's a very interesting guy.

352
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
And the reason I say that is because he's not just some academic

353
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
that sat in a ivory tower somewhere.

354
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
He had a lot of experience in life.

355
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
He had been a policeman in India.

356
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
He had,

357
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
he had fought in the Spanish Revolution.

358
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
He had been shot in the neck.

359
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
So, I mean, this guy is not,

360
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
this guy is not just a,

361
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
just some person that's read a bunch of books,

362
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
and it was an academic.

363
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
No, he's, he's been out there in the world.

364
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
But he, he wrote, so in this book,

365
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
at the end of the book,

366
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
he's got this appendix to the book.

367
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
And the appendix,

368
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
at the end of the book,

369
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
is about this language.

370
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
It's about this language,

371
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
and in a way,

372
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
it might be the most important message in the book,

373
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
or at least it,

374
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
maybe it's not the most important message in the book,

375
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
but it's at least,

376
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
at least it's the least appreciated message in the book.

377
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And that's why I want to read some excerpts from that,

378
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
because this part of the book really

379
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
starts to make you think,

380
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
makes me think anyways.

381
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
But where we are,

382
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
but what we have to be careful of,

383
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
so the appendix is written,

384
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
this appendix that I'm talking about,

385
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
that we're going to jump into.

386
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
It's written almost as like an academic assessment

387
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
of the new speak language.

388
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
So sometime in the future,

389
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
beyond, okay, in the book,

390
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
sometime in the future of this book,

391
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
some academic type person

392
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
is writing about like a historical review

393
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
of this language,

394
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
because you can tell when reading it,

395
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
that the totalitarian state that this takes place in didn't work,

396
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.000
right?

397
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
It's some point failed.

398
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
It failed to really maintain the control

399
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
and suppress the human spirit.

400
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So that's a positive sign, right?

401
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Even though they got Winston,

402
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
some people stood up against it,

403
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
and they were able to fight it off.

404
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And now you get this person,

405
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
this person writing this sort of historical documentation

406
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
about this language.

407
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And you can kind of see,

408
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
he kind of indicates that one of the reasons,

409
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
maybe that the totalitarian government

410
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
wasn't able to maintain control,

411
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
because they couldn't get full control of the language.

412
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And it's very interesting,

413
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
very interesting to go through.

414
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So, here we go.

415
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
1984 by George Orwell,

416
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
and we're skipping the entire novel,

417
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
partly because I think most people have read it.

418
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
I hope,

419
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
but I want to jump into the,

420
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
to the, this appendix.

421
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
So here we go.

422
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
New speak was the official language of Oceana.

423
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
That's the totalitarian state.

424
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And had been devised to meet the ideological needs

425
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
of Innsak,

426
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
which Innsak is an abbreviated term for English socialism.

427
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
In the year 1984,

428
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
there was not as yet anyone who used new speak

429
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
as his soul means of communication,

430
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
either in speech or writing.

431
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
The leading articles,

432
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
so at the point that this book was written at the point

433
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
at the point when 1984,

434
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
in 1984 in this world,

435
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
no one was fully speaking new speak yet.

436
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
That's why you could read it.

437
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
That's why you could read these words.

438
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
They hadn't gotten the new language

439
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
to where they wanted it to be.

440
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
The leading article in the Times

441
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
were written in In It,

442
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
but this was a tour to force that could only be carried out

443
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
by a specialist.

444
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So only like people that were really fluent in new speak

445
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
could write the headlines.

446
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
It was expected that new speak would have finally

447
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
superseded old speak or standard English

448
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
as we should call it.

449
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
By the year 2050.

450
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Meanwhile, it gained ground steadily

451
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
all party members tending to use new speak words

452
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
and grammatical constructions more and more

453
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
in their speech every day.

454
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
The version in use in 1984

455
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
and embodied in the ninth and tenth

456
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
editions of the new speak dictionary

457
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
was a provisional one and contained many

458
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
superfluous words

459
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
and archaic formation formations

460
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
which were due to be suppressed later.

461
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
It is the final perfected version

462
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary

463
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
that we are concerned here.

464
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So this is talking about something

465
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
that you don't get to see in the book

466
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
which is the final version of new speak.

467
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
What they wanted it to be.

468
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
The purpose of new speak

469
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
was not only to provide a medium of expression

470
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
for the world view and mental habits

471
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
proper to the devotees of In-Soc

472
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
but to make all other modes of thought impossible.

473
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
It was intended that new speak had been adopted

474
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
once and for all that old speak

475
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
was would be forgotten

476
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
and a heretical thought that is a thought

477
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
diverging from the principles of In-Soc

478
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
should be literally unthinkable.

479
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
At least so far as it is dependent on words.

480
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
So there was going to be you couldn't commit

481
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
a thought crime anymore because you wouldn't have

482
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
the capability of expressing what it was.

483
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Its vocabulary was so constructed

484
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
as to give exact and often very subtle expression

485
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
to every meaning that a party member could probably

486
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
wish properly wish to express

487
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
while excluding all other meanings

488
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
and also the possibility of arriving at them

489
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
by indirect methods.

490
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So you can even use like multiple words

491
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
to figure out how to say something that wasn't on board

492
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
with the party.

493
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
This was done partly by the invention of new words

494
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words

495
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
and by stripping such words as

496
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
remained of unorthodox meanings

497
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatsoever.

498
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
To give a single example, the word free

499
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
still existed in Newspic but it could only be used

500
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
in such statements as

501
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
this dog is free from lies

502
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
or this field is free from weeds.

503
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
It could not be used in the old sense of

504
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
politically free or intellectually free

505
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
since political and intellectual freedom

506
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
no longer existed even as concepts

507
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
and were therefore of necessity

508
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
nameless.

509
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Couldn't even think of it.

510
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
You couldn't even think of being free.

511
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
The concept didn't exist anymore.

512
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
They eliminated the word.

513
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Quite apart from the suppression of

514
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
definitely heretical words

515
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an

516
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
end in itself and no word that could be

517
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
dispensed with was allowed to survive.

518
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Newspic was designed not to extend but to

519
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
but diminished the range of thought.

520
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And this purpose was indirectly assisted by

521
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.

522
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Scary, right?

523
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Yeah, it's interesting.

524
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Newspic was founded on the English language

525
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
as we now know it though many new speak sentences

526
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
even when not containing newly created words

527
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
and clearly intelligible to an English speaker of our own day.

528
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Newspic words were divided into three distinct classes known as

529
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
the A vocabulary, the B vocabulary, and the C vocabulary.

530
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
It will be simpler to discuss each class separately

531
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with

532
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
in the section devoted to the A-cat vocabulary

533
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
since the rules held good for all three categories.

534
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
So this is the A vocabulary.

535
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000
The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life.

536
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
For such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes,

537
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
going up and downstairs, writing in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like.

538
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
It was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like

539
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field.

540
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
But in comparison with present day English vocabulary,

541
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
their number was extremely small while their meanings were far more rigidly defined.

542
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them.

543
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So far as it could be achieved, a new speak word of this class

544
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept.

545
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
It would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes

546
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
or for political or philosophical discussions.

547
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
It was intended only to express simple,

548
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
propulsive thoughts usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.

549
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So the general populace can't even carry on a political debate

550
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
or a philosophical discussion because they don't even have the vocabulary for it.

551
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
They just can't even have it.

552
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
So we're just, we're just shutting it down.

553
00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
The grammar of new speak had two outstanding peculiarities.

554
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
The first was almost a complete interchangeability between different parts of speech.

555
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Any word in the language in principle,

556
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
this applied to even very abstract words such as if or when,

557
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
could be used as a verb noun adjective or adverb.

558
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Between the verb and the noun form, when they were the same root,

559
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
there was never any variation.

560
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
This rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms.

561
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
The word fuck for example did not exist a new speak.

562
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000
It's place was taken by think, which did the duty for both noun and verb.

563
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
No etymological principle was followed here.

564
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
In some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention

565
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
and other cases it was the verb.

566
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected,

567
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
one of the other of them was frequently suppressed.

568
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
There was for example no such word for cut.

569
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
It's meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun verb knife.

570
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
So can you knife me a piece of cake?

571
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix full to the noun verb and adverbs by saying by adding wise.

572
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Thus for example, speedful meant rapid and speed wise meant quickly.

573
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Certain of our present-day adjectives such as good strong big black soft were attained,

574
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
but their total number was very small.

575
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
There was little need for them.

576
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:47.000
It was almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding full to a noun verb.

577
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
None of these now existing adverbs was retained except very few already ending in wise.

578
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
The wise termination was invariable.

579
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
The word well for example was replaced by good wise.

580
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
In addition, any word this applied in principle to every word in the language could be negative.

581
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Negative by adding the a-fix on or could be strengthened by the a-fix plus or for still greater emphasis double plus.

582
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
So for example, uncalled.

583
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Uncold.

584
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Mount Warley.

585
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
As opposed to uncool.

586
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
There's no word for cool.

587
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I'm just seen in real life, there's a word called uncool and the short version is un-s.

588
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Oh, that's what it is.

589
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Disco-unns.

590
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
But it's not the temperature cool.

591
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
It's you being cool or uncool.

592
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
And un-s-u-n-s.

593
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Un-s is like just short for it.

594
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
So if I'm walking behind you, I trip your foot.

595
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
That's un-s-u-n-s.

596
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Pretty un-s-u-n-s.

597
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Yeah, actually you know what it's more used for stuff that's more un-s than that.

598
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
It's like- So it's a little bit more of a severe phrase.

599
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Severe.

600
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Yes.

601
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I think so.

602
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
In my experience that's how to like if I trip you and you fall and it's in front of some people, that's pretty un-s-n-s.

603
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
You spill your beverage on your-

604
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I was gonna say shirt, but we're probably not wearing a shirt since we're in high.

605
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
No, very rarely.

606
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
If you're doing on purpose, it's un-sured or no shirt, I mean.

607
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
But actually, you know what?

608
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Now they think it's essentially the same thing.

609
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Yeah.

610
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Except the plus part.

611
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I guess if you replace it with very-

612
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Because there's like plus plus, right?

613
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Yeah.

614
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
You say that's very cool.

615
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
No, there's double plus.

616
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Double plus, yes, yes.

617
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Double plus-called meant very cold.

618
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
It's kind of efficient.

619
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
So un-cold meant warm.

620
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Plus-cold and double plus-cold meant very cold and superlatively cold.

621
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Yeah.

622
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Very, very cold.

623
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.96
It was also possible in present day English to modify the meaning of almost any

624
00:42:57.96 --> 00:43:03.96
word by prepositional offenses, such as anti-post up-down.

625
00:43:03.96 --> 00:43:09.96
By such methods, it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary.

626
00:43:09.96 --> 00:43:12.96
Given, for instance, the word good.

627
00:43:12.96 --> 00:43:13.96
Yes, sir.

628
00:43:13.96 --> 00:43:16.96
There was no need for such a word as bad.

629
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:23.96
Since the required meaning was equally well-indeed-better-expressed by un-good.

630
00:43:23.96 --> 00:43:24.96
I don't know.

631
00:43:24.96 --> 00:43:27.96
It seems like there could be a t-shirt possible.

632
00:43:27.96 --> 00:43:29.96
I don't know what to be there.

633
00:43:29.96 --> 00:43:34.96
And I don't say that very often, but it seems like we've talked about good, a fair amount.

634
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:41.96
And we do have a t-shirt that does say good might be kind of cool to have a t-shirt that's said un-good.

635
00:43:41.96 --> 00:43:45.96
Maybe a picture of a Hawaiian getting tripped up on the beat.

636
00:43:45.96 --> 00:43:47.96
Yeah, it would be very un-good, yes.

637
00:43:47.96 --> 00:43:50.96
Un-cool.

638
00:43:50.96 --> 00:43:52.96
All that was necessary.

639
00:43:52.96 --> 00:43:57.96
In any case, where two words formatted a natural pair of opposites was to decide which of them to suppress.

640
00:43:57.96 --> 00:44:02.96
Dark, for example, could be replaced by un-light or light by undark according to preference.

641
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:04.96
You get rid of one of those two words.

642
00:44:04.96 --> 00:44:05.96
Yeah.

643
00:44:05.96 --> 00:44:07.96
Wait, according to preference.

644
00:44:07.96 --> 00:44:09.96
Yeah, so they would just pick either.

645
00:44:09.96 --> 00:44:11.96
We got light and dark.

646
00:44:11.96 --> 00:44:16.96
We don't need both those words, so we pick one of them and then put on in front of it for the other one.

647
00:44:16.96 --> 00:44:18.96
You know what's actually kind of scary?

648
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:20.96
If you let it be scary, it's like-

649
00:44:20.96 --> 00:44:21.96
This whole thing is scary.

650
00:44:21.96 --> 00:44:23.96
It kind of makes sense.

651
00:44:23.96 --> 00:44:24.96
That's the scary part.

652
00:44:24.96 --> 00:44:28.96
Well, you know what I came from?

653
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:30.96
That side came from the fact that-

654
00:44:30.96 --> 00:44:34.96
When I was an English majoring in all of this.

655
00:44:34.96 --> 00:44:35.96
Yeah.

656
00:44:35.96 --> 00:44:40.96
And look, the English language, there's things that are meant they make no sense whatsoever.

657
00:44:40.96 --> 00:44:45.96
Like if you were an engineering mind, right, where you like, you know, the rules,

658
00:44:45.96 --> 00:44:49.96
the rules, the rules, the rules, the rules, the rules, and then you try and figure out how to do English.

659
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:52.96
You're going to have a real hard time with it, man.

660
00:44:52.96 --> 00:44:53.96
Oh, yeah.

661
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:57.96
And that makes sense because, bro, I get, you know, when I first got into whatever I got into,

662
00:44:57.96 --> 00:44:59.96
was each TML.

663
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:01.96
Oh, we're talking computer languages.

664
00:45:01.96 --> 00:45:02.96
Yeah.

665
00:45:02.96 --> 00:45:04.96
Hypertext, manga, language to be exact.

666
00:45:04.96 --> 00:45:05.96
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:10.96
And if you go deeper into the coding thing, you know, it's that's straight up.

668
00:45:10.96 --> 00:45:15.96
Like that is engineering mind, where it's like, bro, the computers, like, hey, tell me what to do.

669
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:16.96
I'll do it.

670
00:45:16.96 --> 00:45:18.96
But you better tell me the right thing.

671
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:22.96
If you, I don't know about tones, you tell me the words or the characters or whatever,

672
00:45:22.96 --> 00:45:23.96
and I'll do it.

673
00:45:23.96 --> 00:45:26.96
And you can tell them like accidentally the wrong thing.

674
00:45:26.96 --> 00:45:27.96
They're going to do that thing.

675
00:45:27.96 --> 00:45:29.96
That's exactly what a computer does.

676
00:45:29.96 --> 00:45:30.96
So you better be specific.

677
00:45:30.96 --> 00:45:36.96
And if you're not specific, it's simply either won't happen or it'll do the thing that you mistakenly were specific about.

678
00:45:36.96 --> 00:45:37.96
Yeah.

679
00:45:37.96 --> 00:45:41.96
That's a little something that we liked to call operator air.

680
00:45:41.96 --> 00:45:42.96
Operator air.

681
00:45:42.96 --> 00:45:44.96
Meaning I messed up.

682
00:45:44.96 --> 00:45:47.96
You know, when the GPS is first came out,

683
00:45:47.96 --> 00:45:51.96
I was pretty, my first reaction was like, why do I need to carry that thing?

684
00:45:51.96 --> 00:45:53.96
That thing weighs 25 pounds.

685
00:45:53.96 --> 00:45:54.96
And they're like, yeah.

686
00:45:54.96 --> 00:45:57.96
And then they say, well, you know, you'll know where you are.

687
00:45:57.96 --> 00:45:59.96
And I go, I have a mapping compass.

688
00:45:59.96 --> 00:46:01.96
I know exactly where I am.

689
00:46:01.96 --> 00:46:02.96
You know, I've had the training.

690
00:46:02.96 --> 00:46:04.96
I'm doing a terrain study.

691
00:46:04.96 --> 00:46:05.96
I know where I'm at.

692
00:46:05.96 --> 00:46:07.96
I have a mapping compass.

693
00:46:07.96 --> 00:46:08.96
I know where I'm at.

694
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:10.96
I mean, it'd be like, you know, if, do you need to do that?

695
00:46:10.96 --> 00:46:11.96
I don't know.

696
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:12.96
I don't know.

697
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:13.96
I don't know.

698
00:46:13.96 --> 00:46:14.96
I don't know.

699
00:46:14.96 --> 00:46:18.96
It'd be like, you know, if, do you need a GPS to get home?

700
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:19.96
Right now.

701
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:20.96
Me, no.

702
00:46:20.96 --> 00:46:21.96
From here.

703
00:46:21.96 --> 00:46:22.96
No, sorry.

704
00:46:22.96 --> 00:46:23.96
That's how I felt.

705
00:46:23.96 --> 00:46:25.96
If someone, when they started telling me I needed a GPS and the field,

706
00:46:25.96 --> 00:46:27.96
I was kind of like, the exact same way you feel.

707
00:46:27.96 --> 00:46:28.96
I was like, why would I need this thing?

708
00:46:28.96 --> 00:46:29.96
Wait, it's 25 pounds.

709
00:46:29.96 --> 00:46:30.96
I have a map.

710
00:46:30.96 --> 00:46:31.96
I have a compass.

711
00:46:31.96 --> 00:46:32.96
I know exactly where I am.

712
00:46:32.96 --> 00:46:34.96
I don't need anything else to help me.

713
00:46:34.96 --> 00:46:36.96
But there are some situations.

714
00:46:36.96 --> 00:46:38.96
You know, when you're out in the open ocean,

715
00:46:38.96 --> 00:46:40.96
there's no, there's nothing to get a bearing off of.

716
00:46:40.96 --> 00:46:41.96
There's nothing there.

717
00:46:41.96 --> 00:46:43.96
So when you're over the horizon,

718
00:46:43.96 --> 00:46:44.96
you can't shoot a bearing.

719
00:46:44.96 --> 00:46:46.96
Once you get closer to the shore, you can shoot a bearing.

720
00:46:46.96 --> 00:46:47.96
You can figure out where you are.

721
00:46:47.96 --> 00:46:49.96
In the open desert, sometimes too.

722
00:46:49.96 --> 00:46:51.96
There's nothing to shoot a bearing off of.

723
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:52.96
That you can see.

724
00:46:52.96 --> 00:46:55.96
So sometimes you do need that GPS.

725
00:46:55.96 --> 00:47:01.96
But the early GPS is, they, they weren't that good.

726
00:47:01.96 --> 00:47:03.96
Well, they took a long time to find themselves.

727
00:47:03.96 --> 00:47:05.96
But once they found themselves, then all of a sudden,

728
00:47:05.96 --> 00:47:08.96
I realized, well, this thing is freaking super accurate.

729
00:47:08.96 --> 00:47:12.96
And sometimes people would get lost, right?

730
00:47:12.96 --> 00:47:15.96
You know, and then they'd blame the GPS.

731
00:47:15.96 --> 00:47:18.96
And I would say, operator.

732
00:47:18.96 --> 00:47:19.96
Yeah.

733
00:47:19.96 --> 00:47:20.96
That thing did not,

734
00:47:20.96 --> 00:47:27.96
you don't have the one GPS that took and changed the coordinates of earth.

735
00:47:27.96 --> 00:47:28.96
Right?

736
00:47:28.96 --> 00:47:29.96
Yeah.

737
00:47:29.96 --> 00:47:30.96
I didn't happen.

738
00:47:30.96 --> 00:47:31.96
I'm sure enough I'd pull it out.

739
00:47:31.96 --> 00:47:32.96
Oh, yeah.

740
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:33.96
You missed the digits here.

741
00:47:33.96 --> 00:47:36.96
You added to, you know, you fat finger the digit over here.

742
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:37.96
And that's the problem.

743
00:47:37.96 --> 00:47:38.96
Oh, yeah.

744
00:47:38.96 --> 00:47:41.96
That, that, that, that's so true.

745
00:47:41.96 --> 00:47:44.96
And then you're like in HTML as well, right?

746
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:48.96
So it's essentially like, and you, you talk about your English major.

747
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:49.96
And, you know, how it's like,

748
00:47:49.96 --> 00:47:52.96
I took a glass called advanced grammar and syntax.

749
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:53.96
Yeah.

750
00:47:53.96 --> 00:47:58.96
So the reason that, okay, I said, I'm not, I'm not an English major.

751
00:47:58.96 --> 00:48:00.96
But I talking to other people.

752
00:48:00.96 --> 00:48:03.96
And here's this little factor in English is this,

753
00:48:03.96 --> 00:48:10.96
is one of the main differentulators between like the engineering situation and me talking to you situation.

754
00:48:10.96 --> 00:48:13.96
I mean, you use like tones and all the stuff, my emotion and all this stuff or whatever.

755
00:48:13.96 --> 00:48:17.96
And I can say like literally the wrong thing, but I can say, hey, you know what I mean though.

756
00:48:17.96 --> 00:48:19.96
And you could probably say yes.

757
00:48:19.96 --> 00:48:25.96
There is that little soft, wiggly room, you know, or if I miss speaking, say someone else's name,

758
00:48:25.96 --> 00:48:28.96
but you know, I met this other guy's name in a story or something like this.

759
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:30.96
And I can be like, oh, you know what I mean?

760
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:31.96
And you be like, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

761
00:48:31.96 --> 00:48:33.96
There's, that does not exist in in.

762
00:48:33.96 --> 00:48:34.96
Great machine, how rich.

763
00:48:34.96 --> 00:48:35.96
Yeah.

764
00:48:35.96 --> 00:48:39.96
You can be like, you know, five, five, five, six, one.

765
00:48:39.96 --> 00:48:42.96
Five, five, six, one, five, five, five, five, six, one.

766
00:48:42.96 --> 00:48:45.96
Five, five, six and then maybe like a two, you know.

767
00:48:45.96 --> 00:48:46.96
And then five, five, five things.

768
00:48:46.96 --> 00:48:48.96
And the things like, okay, too, that's on purpose.

769
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:49.96
Boom, let's execute that.

770
00:48:49.96 --> 00:48:50.96
That's what the machine does.

771
00:48:50.96 --> 00:48:52.96
Instead of like, all right.

772
00:48:52.96 --> 00:48:55.96
Hey, did you mean five, five, six, one on this two here?

773
00:48:55.96 --> 00:48:58.96
And then you know, like a person will think that, you know.

774
00:48:58.96 --> 00:48:59.96
Yeah.

775
00:48:59.96 --> 00:49:07.96
I have this thing one time as a guy trying to explain like about the piano and about what what what

776
00:49:07.96 --> 00:49:10.96
how you play the piano good basically.

777
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:14.96
And so he plays a song and he basically hit the notes like a machine.

778
00:49:14.96 --> 00:49:15.96
You know what I'm saying?

779
00:49:15.96 --> 00:49:17.96
Like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, just hit it like it.

780
00:49:17.96 --> 00:49:22.96
It was some famous, you know, song on the piano on what it was, but some kind of like

781
00:49:22.96 --> 00:49:25.96
classical piano song.

782
00:49:25.96 --> 00:49:31.96
But he plays it like a robot basically just every key gets the same pressure and whatever.

783
00:49:31.96 --> 00:49:35.96
And then he plays it like a human.

784
00:49:35.96 --> 00:49:38.96
And it sounds really, really different.

785
00:49:38.96 --> 00:49:40.96
So there's a lot that's going on.

786
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:41.96
Better.

787
00:49:41.96 --> 00:49:43.96
Oh, the human one is way better.

788
00:49:43.96 --> 00:49:44.96
Yeah.

789
00:49:44.96 --> 00:49:45.96
So yeah.

790
00:49:45.96 --> 00:49:46.96
It's like this, too.

791
00:49:46.96 --> 00:49:47.96
It's the same thing with guitar.

792
00:49:47.96 --> 00:49:52.96
Like you can get people that pluck the notes and they can pluck them perfectly.

793
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:59.96
But then you get, you know, Jimmy Page and he's bending them and flint the wrong note,

794
00:49:59.96 --> 00:50:00.96
bringing it back.

795
00:50:00.96 --> 00:50:01.96
Yeah.

796
00:50:01.96 --> 00:50:02.96
It's a human element.

797
00:50:02.96 --> 00:50:03.96
There's a rawness to it.

798
00:50:03.96 --> 00:50:04.96
Yeah.

799
00:50:04.96 --> 00:50:11.96
It's like obviously millions of examples, but like you have analog and digital, like

800
00:50:11.96 --> 00:50:12.96
even if you go film, right?

801
00:50:12.96 --> 00:50:16.96
If you go film this little imperfections in there that make it kind of a softer kind of

802
00:50:16.96 --> 00:50:18.96
feel and then digital is kind of hard.

803
00:50:18.96 --> 00:50:21.96
Even though digital is getting so advanced where it's kind of incorporating that kind of

804
00:50:21.96 --> 00:50:24.96
stuff in that, but CGI, for example.

805
00:50:24.96 --> 00:50:29.96
Like if you look at early CGI, you're like, by that's so lame because it's too perfect.

806
00:50:29.96 --> 00:50:30.96
It's too like computer.

807
00:50:30.96 --> 00:50:32.96
It looks like a video game almost, right?

808
00:50:32.96 --> 00:50:37.96
You forgot like all the light bouncing off of this thing that leaf over there and all the light

809
00:50:37.96 --> 00:50:41.96
spill from this color of this guy shirt and all the imperfections, all that stuff is all

810
00:50:41.96 --> 00:50:43.96
in play and real light.

811
00:50:43.96 --> 00:50:45.96
And that's how the light real light is, you know?

812
00:50:45.96 --> 00:50:51.96
And then, but you try to recreate it in a computer, especially one that's not as accurate

813
00:50:51.96 --> 00:50:52.96
as real life.

814
00:50:52.96 --> 00:50:53.96
Which is gonna take a while.

815
00:50:53.96 --> 00:50:54.96
Right.

816
00:50:54.96 --> 00:50:56.96
It's gonna feel like a computer, you know?

817
00:50:56.96 --> 00:51:08.96
I was listening to someone talking about making music and it had to do with Jack White from the White Stripes.

818
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:09.96
Sure.

819
00:51:09.96 --> 00:51:18.96
And basically when you get a drummer like nowadays, what they do, if you, if you're not going to make a record.

820
00:51:18.96 --> 00:51:20.96
So here's what we do.

821
00:51:20.96 --> 00:51:21.96
Down.

822
00:51:21.96 --> 00:51:22.96
Here's what we do.

823
00:51:22.96 --> 00:51:23.96
We take the record.

824
00:51:23.96 --> 00:51:26.96
We record a snare drum.

825
00:51:26.96 --> 00:51:29.96
Rock and we record 30 cracks on the snare drum.

826
00:51:29.96 --> 00:51:31.96
We take the perfect one.

827
00:51:31.96 --> 00:51:32.96
That sounds perfect.

828
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:34.96
That's the snare.

829
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:37.96
And then we take the high hat.

830
00:51:37.96 --> 00:51:40.96
And we get the perfect, we record 50 of 100 of them.

831
00:51:40.96 --> 00:51:43.96
We get the perfect one that sounds exactly the way we want it.

832
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:45.96
And then we take that.

833
00:51:45.96 --> 00:51:47.96
And then we take all the different drums.

834
00:51:47.96 --> 00:51:48.96
We find the perfect sounds.

835
00:51:48.96 --> 00:51:49.96
We're making a digital drum.

836
00:51:49.96 --> 00:51:51.96
It's a recording of a real drum.

837
00:51:51.96 --> 00:51:54.96
But it is, it's the same one.

838
00:51:54.96 --> 00:51:56.96
It's a perfect shot snare shot.

839
00:51:56.96 --> 00:51:57.96
And they take that.

840
00:51:57.96 --> 00:51:59.96
And then they lay down the beat.

841
00:51:59.96 --> 00:52:04.96
And the beat is 1000 percent accurate because it's computer.

842
00:52:04.96 --> 00:52:06.96
It's, it's absolutely a perfect.

843
00:52:06.96 --> 00:52:07.96
Right.

844
00:52:07.96 --> 00:52:08.96
Right.

845
00:52:08.96 --> 00:52:10.96
It's right on every single time.

846
00:52:10.96 --> 00:52:13.96
And that right there when you hear it.

847
00:52:13.96 --> 00:52:17.96
And that's what when you hear like a pop 40, whatever, like a pop 40 music.

848
00:52:17.96 --> 00:52:18.96
That's what you're hearing.

849
00:52:18.96 --> 00:52:19.96
You're hearing a, sure.

850
00:52:19.96 --> 00:52:22.96
You can be like, oh, yeah, a person played that, but it got played.

851
00:52:22.96 --> 00:52:26.96
They can also take the drum like if a drummer and they can line up.

852
00:52:26.96 --> 00:52:29.96
His, he was off by a half a millisecond.

853
00:52:29.96 --> 00:52:29.96
Cool.

854
00:52:29.96 --> 00:52:30.96
It's all perfect.

855
00:52:30.96 --> 00:52:31.96
Now they line it all up.

856
00:52:31.96 --> 00:52:32.96
They line it all up.

857
00:52:32.96 --> 00:52:34.96
So you're hearing this, what you said.

858
00:52:34.96 --> 00:52:36.96
You're hearing this perfection.

859
00:52:36.96 --> 00:52:42.96
And there's a, there's a, there's a, a fakeness to it.

860
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:44.96
There's something that we don't like.

861
00:52:44.96 --> 00:52:47.96
And you hear like, for the white stripes, because we're talking about the white stripes.

862
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:48.96
Or Jack White.

863
00:52:48.96 --> 00:52:50.96
But he's, he's doing things.

864
00:52:50.96 --> 00:52:55.96
The, the, you're like, oh, that was, he just said something wild.

865
00:52:55.96 --> 00:52:56.96
Yeah.

866
00:52:56.96 --> 00:52:57.96
Human there.

867
00:52:57.96 --> 00:52:59.96
And, and that's gives it this reality.

868
00:52:59.96 --> 00:53:00.96
Yeah.

869
00:53:00.96 --> 00:53:03.96
So there's a, we want to have that.

870
00:53:03.96 --> 00:53:04.96
You know, I want to have that.

871
00:53:04.96 --> 00:53:07.96
Did you think when I said what sounded a bit, but when you said what sounded better,

872
00:53:07.96 --> 00:53:11.96
the, the mechanical piano playing sound or their human,

873
00:53:11.96 --> 00:53:13.96
did you think I was going to say the mechanical sound?

874
00:53:13.96 --> 00:53:14.96
No, no.

875
00:53:14.96 --> 00:53:15.96
We're just checking me.

876
00:53:15.96 --> 00:53:16.96
Yeah.

877
00:53:16.96 --> 00:53:17.96
That's one way to put it.

878
00:53:17.96 --> 00:53:18.96
Exactly.

879
00:53:18.96 --> 00:53:19.96
I wasn't checking you.

880
00:53:19.96 --> 00:53:21.96
I was like, we're going to want to expose the example.

881
00:53:21.96 --> 00:53:22.96
It's kind of like that.

882
00:53:22.96 --> 00:53:26.96
Like where, because you weren't making a point or where you,

883
00:53:26.96 --> 00:53:29.96
I didn't seem like you were making a point that one wasn't necessarily better or worse.

884
00:53:29.96 --> 00:53:31.96
You were just identifying what the difference.

885
00:53:31.96 --> 00:53:32.96
That's what it seemed like.

886
00:53:32.96 --> 00:53:33.96
So I, yeah.

887
00:53:33.96 --> 00:53:34.96
Right.

888
00:53:34.96 --> 00:53:38.96
I wasn't, I wasn't purposely making the point that one was better or worse.

889
00:53:38.96 --> 00:53:40.96
I thought that would be self evident.

890
00:53:40.96 --> 00:53:43.96
And if you ever heard a robot play a piano, you would know that it was kind of self

891
00:53:43.96 --> 00:53:44.96
that sounds black.

892
00:53:44.96 --> 00:53:46.96
I don't know that.

893
00:53:46.96 --> 00:53:49.96
I remember when I was a kid they had like these,

894
00:53:49.96 --> 00:53:52.96
pianos that had these pieces of paper,

895
00:53:52.96 --> 00:53:57.96
these rolls of paper that that would go through.

896
00:53:57.96 --> 00:54:05.96
And it was basically some kind of a mechanical computer that told it what notes to play.

897
00:54:05.96 --> 00:54:07.96
You know, it didn't be anything.

898
00:54:07.96 --> 00:54:10.96
Yeah, self-playing piano.

899
00:54:10.96 --> 00:54:11.96
Yeah.

900
00:54:11.96 --> 00:54:13.96
Old school, self-playing piano.

901
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:17.96
Yeah, but I would think that that would still have this analog feel to it.

902
00:54:17.96 --> 00:54:19.96
It feels physical paper.

903
00:54:19.96 --> 00:54:23.96
It had a little bit, it had more analog than a computer because guess what?

904
00:54:23.96 --> 00:54:28.96
The, the analog machine is like not perfect.

905
00:54:28.96 --> 00:54:29.96
It's still doing the work.

906
00:54:29.96 --> 00:54:30.96
Yeah, exactly.

907
00:54:30.96 --> 00:54:32.96
It's still got to like hit the note in there.

908
00:54:32.96 --> 00:54:33.96
Yeah.

909
00:54:33.96 --> 00:54:35.96
Is it to hit that little thing as to hit the string?

910
00:54:35.96 --> 00:54:36.96
Yeah.

911
00:54:36.96 --> 00:54:37.96
And that's an mechanical thing, right?

912
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:38.96
Yeah.

913
00:54:38.96 --> 00:54:39.96
Yeah.

914
00:54:39.96 --> 00:54:40.96
That's absolutely correct.

915
00:54:40.96 --> 00:54:41.96
It's mechanical, not digital.

916
00:54:41.96 --> 00:54:42.96
Right.

917
00:54:42.96 --> 00:54:44.96
It's analog, I guess, so what we're saying?

918
00:54:44.96 --> 00:54:45.96
Yeah.

919
00:54:45.96 --> 00:54:49.96
CJ has a big one and getting back to that like, you know how they computer and still they don't have this down at all.

920
00:54:49.96 --> 00:54:50.96
I don't know.

921
00:54:50.96 --> 00:54:51.96
I mean, it's they're getting good.

922
00:54:51.96 --> 00:55:02.96
I don't, I don't think they're very even close to it yet, but, you know, they can recreate certain things digitally in CJ, like water and machines and light and all this stuff.

923
00:55:02.96 --> 00:55:04.96
And some of it, they have it straight up, they have it down.

924
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:11.96
But if you come to, when it comes to the human face, the human face when it's, and when it's not animated, it's good.

925
00:55:11.96 --> 00:55:12.96
It's not really solid.

926
00:55:12.96 --> 00:55:15.96
They can get skin tones and reflections and transparency.

927
00:55:15.96 --> 00:55:16.96
All that stuff.

928
00:55:16.96 --> 00:55:24.96
But when they start talking, there's so many complexities in your face and as a human being instinctually, we recognize them so deeply.

929
00:55:24.96 --> 00:55:25.96
Yeah.

930
00:55:25.96 --> 00:55:26.96
We just get, we're not even there.

931
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:27.96
We're not.

932
00:55:27.96 --> 00:55:31.96
So, but don't we improving our technology so rapidly that we'll get there a lot quicker than we've got to this point.

933
00:55:31.96 --> 00:55:32.96
I think so.

934
00:55:32.96 --> 00:55:33.96
Yeah.

935
00:55:33.96 --> 00:55:34.96
I believe that is the case.

936
00:55:34.96 --> 00:55:40.96
But as of right now, you can get the best, best one when it's completely made from CJ,

937
00:55:40.96 --> 00:55:47.96
because now they get a real person's face and they match this and match that and even then, man, it's really hard.

938
00:55:47.96 --> 00:55:52.96
Unless it's like a super simple expression or a pauser, something like that.

939
00:55:52.96 --> 00:55:57.96
But you get someone to talk, a CGI face to talk, no matter how good it is, it looks weird.

940
00:55:57.96 --> 00:55:59.96
It looks actually scary.

941
00:55:59.96 --> 00:56:01.96
Because it looks like, oh, are you trying to be a person?

942
00:56:01.96 --> 00:56:03.96
What about the deep fakes?

943
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:05.96
Somebody just posted a deep fake.

944
00:56:05.96 --> 00:56:06.96
Okay.

945
00:56:06.96 --> 00:56:07.96
Yeah.

946
00:56:07.96 --> 00:56:08.96
So the deep fakes are a little bit different.

947
00:56:08.96 --> 00:56:09.96
It's got a cool.

948
00:56:09.96 --> 00:56:11.96
They're kind of scary too though.

949
00:56:11.96 --> 00:56:15.96
When you think about it, whatever this, I mean, for different reasons obviously.

950
00:56:15.96 --> 00:56:18.96
But yeah, the deep fakes, they take an actual face though.

951
00:56:18.96 --> 00:56:19.96
It's not recreated digitally.

952
00:56:19.96 --> 00:56:28.96
Because they take your actual face from a million or however many available representations of your face, it actually exist.

953
00:56:28.96 --> 00:56:31.96
They take that and then they match it up to another face.

954
00:56:31.96 --> 00:56:33.96
So that's a different process.

955
00:56:33.96 --> 00:56:37.96
But if you get a basically essentially a sculptor in a rigour, it's regained.

956
00:56:37.96 --> 00:56:39.96
It means like, oh, I'm going to control this sidebar out.

957
00:56:39.96 --> 00:56:41.96
And there's I laid in all this stuff.

958
00:56:41.96 --> 00:56:43.96
You rig everything, the best, best guys.

959
00:56:43.96 --> 00:56:46.96
It's going to look like a weird, like a weird monster.

960
00:56:46.96 --> 00:56:48.96
And then there's a word for it.

961
00:56:48.96 --> 00:56:52.96
The fact that it's weird, it's called the uncanny valley.

962
00:56:52.96 --> 00:56:58.96
And it's like, so it's this valley between the real deal, recognizing it as the real deal and then a fake deal.

963
00:56:58.96 --> 00:57:02.96
So the small of the uncanny valley, the more offsetting it is.

964
00:57:02.96 --> 00:57:06.96
So if it's like a straight up robot face, like if you remember the back of the like short circuit,

965
00:57:06.96 --> 00:57:07.96
remember that movie?

966
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:08.96
Sure.

967
00:57:08.96 --> 00:57:09.96
Sure.

968
00:57:09.96 --> 00:57:10.96
So I can't remember if I any way.

969
00:57:10.96 --> 00:57:18.96
But I don't know why I did watch ET the other day with, I don't even, there's an obviously no CGI in there, but man, I hadn't seen ET since I was 10 or whatever.

970
00:57:18.96 --> 00:57:20.96
Eight or whatever it came out.

971
00:57:20.96 --> 00:57:21.96
I saw it in the theater.

972
00:57:21.96 --> 00:57:26.96
And like I remembered like this really good movie, you know, like space aliens.

973
00:57:26.96 --> 00:57:28.96
Have you watched it lately?

974
00:57:28.96 --> 00:57:29.96
No.

975
00:57:29.96 --> 00:57:32.96
I was, I was really kind of,

976
00:57:32.96 --> 00:57:37.96
I liked it.

977
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:43.96
But journalist like what you wanna watch was, is that if the same thing I offered on TV,

978
00:57:43.96 --> 00:57:46.96
John T.

979
00:57:46.96 --> 00:57:47.96
То.

980
00:57:47.96 --> 00:57:52.96
Man, I'm a Steve In Spielberg.

981
00:57:52.96 --> 00:57:55.96
If you're out there, I like, I get it, rather than you working.

982
00:57:55.96 --> 00:57:57.96
We've watched you at the time.

983
00:57:57.96 --> 00:57:59.96
All good.

984
00:57:59.96 --> 00:58:03.76
He looks like a doll that someone's moving around.

985
00:58:03.76 --> 00:58:04.96
It's crazy to watch.

986
00:58:04.96 --> 00:58:05.96
Maybe he's playing it.

987
00:58:05.96 --> 00:58:06.96
That's how they look.

988
00:58:06.96 --> 00:58:08.16
You see him saying, come on.

989
00:58:08.16 --> 00:58:09.16
Come out.

990
00:58:09.16 --> 00:58:12.32
But there isn't actually an argue kid.

991
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:14.84
They call that practical effects versus visual effects.

992
00:58:14.84 --> 00:58:18.000
So like practical effects is like, like the physical thing.

993
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Visual is like CG.

994
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Right.

995
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.40
There's a big argument for practical effects.

996
00:58:23.40 --> 00:58:25.44
They should be like practical effects.

997
00:58:25.44 --> 00:58:26.72
I think we all do.

998
00:58:26.72 --> 00:58:29.76
But the uncanny valley thing.

999
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:34.60
Like ET even for example, if it's so obviously not a person, no one can, it's not going

1000
00:58:34.60 --> 00:58:35.60
to off put anybody.

1001
00:58:35.60 --> 00:58:36.80
Everyone's going to be like, okay, cool.

1002
00:58:36.80 --> 00:58:37.80
It's a non person.

1003
00:58:37.80 --> 00:58:40.20
Whatever it is, robot, alien, whatever.

1004
00:58:40.20 --> 00:58:45.000
But if it is a person, but it's not exactly exactly straight up a real person.

1005
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.28
Everyone's going to be freaking weirded out by the thing.

1006
00:58:48.28 --> 00:58:53.76
So to bring us back to what we're talking about and believe it or not, this entire

1007
00:58:53.76 --> 00:58:58.44
rabbit hole we just went down to, down is absolutely applicable.

1008
00:58:58.44 --> 00:59:03.40
We're talking about because what we're talking about is we're talking about removing the

1009
00:59:03.40 --> 00:59:08.04
ability for human beings to express themselves properly.

1010
00:59:08.04 --> 00:59:14.52
We're removing that ability and when we remove words from the language, we're removing

1011
00:59:14.52 --> 00:59:20.44
the ability for humans to express themselves.

1012
00:59:20.44 --> 00:59:25.44
And therefore we are removing the ability to think.

1013
00:59:25.44 --> 00:59:28.96
That is a scary thing.

1014
00:59:28.96 --> 00:59:33.52
Yeah, it's like the difference between, you know, when you take a test.

1015
00:59:33.52 --> 00:59:34.80
And there's all kinds of tests, right?

1016
00:59:34.80 --> 00:59:39.28
So there's like, if you go down the spectrum of tests, there's like the essay question

1017
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:42.28
or the thesis, really, the straight up thesis.

1018
00:59:42.28 --> 00:59:44.40
There's probably more comprehensive tests than that.

1019
00:59:44.40 --> 00:59:45.88
But we'll thesis.

1020
00:59:45.88 --> 00:59:46.88
Yeah.

1021
00:59:46.88 --> 00:59:50.16
Then you got your essay question test.

1022
00:59:50.16 --> 00:59:52.92
Then you got a multiple choice and then true false.

1023
00:59:52.92 --> 00:59:57.56
You know, actually there's a few before multiple choice because you got your like, hey,

1024
00:59:57.56 --> 00:59:58.56
what's this?

1025
00:59:58.56 --> 00:59:59.56
And you have to say the answer.

1026
00:59:59.56 --> 01:00:00.56
Okay.

1027
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:01.56
Fallen the death.

1028
01:00:01.56 --> 01:00:04.52
Feel in the death, fill in the blanks, sentence word, whatever.

1029
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:06.16
And you got your multiple choice, right?

1030
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:10.92
ABCD, all the above, not the above, whatever.

1031
01:00:10.92 --> 01:00:12.64
Then you got your true false.

1032
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:13.64
Yeah.

1033
01:00:13.64 --> 01:00:16.28
So now you got just straight binary now.

1034
01:00:16.28 --> 01:00:17.76
True false.

1035
01:00:17.76 --> 01:00:21.000
No room for freaking nuance.

1036
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
No nothing.

1037
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.48
You seem saying what tested you prefer the most.

1038
01:00:24.48 --> 01:00:26.48
Well, depends.

1039
01:00:26.48 --> 01:00:28.76
Depends what all that was.

1040
01:00:28.76 --> 01:00:31.52
And what the subject was for sure.

1041
01:00:31.52 --> 01:00:34.12
If I didn't care, but just wanted to, like, great.

1042
01:00:34.12 --> 01:00:35.52
Obviously the true false.

1043
01:00:35.52 --> 01:00:36.52
Really.

1044
01:00:36.52 --> 01:00:42.68
I always felt like I had a little bit of better, you know, because maybe I wasn't, you

1045
01:00:42.68 --> 01:00:46.16
know, when we're talking, we're talking, you know, teenage years.

1046
01:00:46.16 --> 01:00:50.08
Maybe I wasn't quite really doing much study at that time.

1047
01:00:50.08 --> 01:00:51.08
Yeah.

1048
01:00:51.08 --> 01:00:56.96
So I could maybe write a better essay and fill in the blanks a little bit about what,

1049
01:00:56.96 --> 01:00:59.80
you know, maybe there's a concept because I was good if I understood a concept, I could

1050
01:00:59.80 --> 01:01:00.80
kind of run with it.

1051
01:01:00.80 --> 01:01:01.80
Yeah.

1052
01:01:01.80 --> 01:01:04.40
Whereas true false, like what happened on this date, I'd be like, because I didn't read

1053
01:01:04.40 --> 01:01:05.40
it and study it, you know?

1054
01:01:05.40 --> 01:01:06.40
Yeah.

1055
01:01:06.40 --> 01:01:07.80
Now when I went to college, I was like, bring it.

1056
01:01:07.80 --> 01:01:09.12
I was like, what taste you were kind of touchy.

1057
01:01:09.12 --> 01:01:10.12
You want to give me.

1058
01:01:10.12 --> 01:01:11.12
Yeah.

1059
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:12.12
But a lot of those.

1060
01:01:12.12 --> 01:01:16.64
So true and I'm sure educators have a good grasp on why you would ever administer a true

1061
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:21.000
false, question, test versus, you know, any of the other ones.

1062
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.24
And I hope anyway, because man, if you're doing like a, like a history true false, like

1063
01:01:27.24 --> 01:01:32.16
that's way more dangerous because of like how much nuance or in perspective, like, if you

1064
01:01:32.16 --> 01:01:36.32
got, okay, so my daughter will ask me questions and I'll always answer and I told you this

1065
01:01:36.32 --> 01:01:39.92
before, where I'll always answer with depends.

1066
01:01:39.92 --> 01:01:42.12
Like what's your favorite color?

1067
01:01:42.12 --> 01:01:43.12
Frick in depends.

1068
01:01:43.12 --> 01:01:44.12
Good one.

1069
01:01:44.12 --> 01:01:45.12
But my favorite color.

1070
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:50.60
What wearing stuff or my car or Brad's different, you know, or not even necessarily, it

1071
01:01:50.60 --> 01:01:51.60
is different.

1072
01:01:51.60 --> 01:01:52.60
It's like black and color.

1073
01:01:52.60 --> 01:01:56.72
It can be tiger stripe camels.

1074
01:01:56.72 --> 01:02:00.56
Most actually, my favorite color actually is black and they know that, but then she'll always

1075
01:02:00.56 --> 01:02:03.56
probe me like what's your favorite color, what's your favorite color.

1076
01:02:03.56 --> 01:02:07.36
And then so it makes you think about it, you know, so I'm like black, but Brad, I'm not

1077
01:02:07.36 --> 01:02:12.32
going to wear like black under in certain circumstances, certain blacks.

1078
01:02:12.32 --> 01:02:17.32
So speaking of tests and speaking of language, because I'm over here just trying to real things

1079
01:02:17.32 --> 01:02:19.72
back into what subject, which is, you know, cool.

1080
01:02:19.72 --> 01:02:20.72
That's something I'm proposing for.

1081
01:02:20.72 --> 01:02:21.72
He's been.

1082
01:02:21.72 --> 01:02:22.72
He's been.

1083
01:02:22.72 --> 01:02:23.72
He's been.

1084
01:02:23.72 --> 01:02:24.72
So check this out.

1085
01:02:24.72 --> 01:02:30.28
When you, when you, when you went to college and you took, was there a possibility of taking

1086
01:02:30.28 --> 01:02:36.48
a class where you wouldn't get graded by a letter, but you would either get through the

1087
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:38.32
class or not get through the class?

1088
01:02:38.32 --> 01:02:39.32
Yeah.

1089
01:02:39.32 --> 01:02:40.32
What was that called?

1090
01:02:40.32 --> 01:02:41.72
Pass, no pass.

1091
01:02:41.72 --> 01:02:42.72
Okay.

1092
01:02:42.72 --> 01:02:47.72
So when I work, because I, as my, one of my daughters in college, they're like offering

1093
01:02:47.72 --> 01:02:51.16
an alcins, everything's online, you can take every class.

1094
01:02:51.16 --> 01:02:53.84
She says, I can take, you know, she said they're telling us we could take every class,

1095
01:02:53.84 --> 01:02:54.84
pass, no pass.

1096
01:02:54.84 --> 01:02:57.04
Oh, that's like the option.

1097
01:02:57.04 --> 01:02:59.32
When I was a kid, no one is called.

1098
01:02:59.32 --> 01:03:00.32
Pass failed.

1099
01:03:00.32 --> 01:03:01.32
Yeah.

1100
01:03:01.32 --> 01:03:04.28
That's what it was in our studio.

1101
01:03:04.28 --> 01:03:05.32
It was called pass fail.

1102
01:03:05.32 --> 01:03:06.32
Yeah.

1103
01:03:06.32 --> 01:03:07.68
Now it's called pass, no pass.

1104
01:03:07.68 --> 01:03:08.68
No pass.

1105
01:03:08.68 --> 01:03:09.68
Yes.

1106
01:03:09.68 --> 01:03:10.68
On pass, right?

1107
01:03:10.68 --> 01:03:15.36
Because we, we remove the word fail out of the vocabulary.

1108
01:03:15.36 --> 01:03:18.88
Yeah, I might mess with people self esteem, man.

1109
01:03:18.88 --> 01:03:19.88
Yeah.

1110
01:03:19.88 --> 01:03:20.88
That's a fail.

1111
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:21.88
There's your fail.

1112
01:03:21.88 --> 01:03:22.88
Yeah.

1113
01:03:22.88 --> 01:03:23.88
All right.

1114
01:03:23.88 --> 01:03:26.88
We're getting back to the book.

1115
01:03:26.88 --> 01:03:31.12
The second distinguishing mark of new speak grammar was its regularity.

1116
01:03:31.12 --> 01:03:35.68
Subject to few exceptions, which were mentioned below all inflections, followed the same

1117
01:03:35.68 --> 01:03:37.32
rules.

1118
01:03:37.32 --> 01:03:45.32
This in all verbs, the predatory and past participle were the same and ended in ED.

1119
01:03:45.32 --> 01:03:47.32
The predatory of steel was steel.

1120
01:03:47.32 --> 01:03:53.16
The predatory of think was think and so on throughout the language, all such forms, such

1121
01:03:53.16 --> 01:03:56.28
a swam gave, brought spoke taken being a boss.

1122
01:03:56.28 --> 01:03:57.28
So you like this part.

1123
01:03:57.28 --> 01:04:00.08
Because now it's all more uniformed.

1124
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:01.08
Yeah.

1125
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:06.84
The rules are all plurals were made by adding S's or ES's as the case might be.

1126
01:04:06.84 --> 01:04:13.40
The plurals of man, ox, life were man's, ox's, life's.

1127
01:04:13.40 --> 01:04:19.20
Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding ER or EST.

1128
01:04:19.20 --> 01:04:23.80
Good, good or goodest.

1129
01:04:23.80 --> 01:04:28.72
Irregular forms and more and the more most formation being suppressed.

1130
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:35.80
So we got rid of, they got rid of more and most and just got good, good or goodest.

1131
01:04:35.80 --> 01:04:40.60
The only classes of words which were still allowed to inflect regularly were the pronouns,

1132
01:04:40.60 --> 01:04:45.24
the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives and the auxiliary verbs.

1133
01:04:45.24 --> 01:04:50.16
All of these followed their ancient usage except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary

1134
01:04:50.16 --> 01:04:53.08
and the shall should, tenses had been dropped.

1135
01:04:53.08 --> 01:04:56.16
All they're used to being covered by will and wood.

1136
01:04:56.16 --> 01:05:00.92
There were also certain irregularities in word formation arising out of the need for

1137
01:05:00.92 --> 01:05:01.92
rapid and easy speech.

1138
01:05:01.92 --> 01:05:07.32
A word that was difficult to utter was liable to be incorrectly heard was held to be

1139
01:05:07.32 --> 01:05:09.16
ipso facto of bad word.

1140
01:05:09.16 --> 01:05:15.36
Occasionally, therefore, for the sake of you from any extra letters were inserted into

1141
01:05:15.36 --> 01:05:18.72
a word or an archaic formation was retained.

1142
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:27.64
This was, but this need made itself, felt chiefly in connection with the B vocabulary.

1143
01:05:27.64 --> 01:05:33.44
Why, so great and important was attached to ease of pronunciation when we made clear later

1144
01:05:33.44 --> 01:05:34.44
in the session.

1145
01:05:34.44 --> 01:05:41.12
So one of their main purposes was to make these things easy to say and clear.

1146
01:05:41.12 --> 01:05:43.84
We're trying to dumb everything down for society.

1147
01:05:43.84 --> 01:05:49.56
Yeah, like you know, home, everyone's all you see like one of these little diagrams and

1148
01:05:49.56 --> 01:05:56.72
they say like, I don't know if they actually, I don't think they say this is proper,

1149
01:05:56.72 --> 01:06:01.60
but the whole diagram implies that it's proper.

1150
01:06:01.60 --> 01:06:06.96
So it's like very good and then they say, don't say very good, say excellent.

1151
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:12.80
You know, don't say whatever, say that, you know, they like they tell you the actual word

1152
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:15.04
for a fair, like don't say.

1153
01:06:15.04 --> 01:06:19.04
And it's in a weird way, it almost seems like it's the opposite of that, you know, wherever

1154
01:06:19.04 --> 01:06:21.04
it's like, hey, they're trying to expand your vocabulary.

1155
01:06:21.04 --> 01:06:22.04
It is the opposite.

1156
01:06:22.04 --> 01:06:29.80
Like when you're in, when you write up an English paper in ninth grade and you say the

1157
01:06:29.80 --> 01:06:32.64
chicken that I ate last night was very, very, very dry.

1158
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:35.04
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1159
01:06:35.04 --> 01:06:35.48
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1160
01:06:35.48 --> 01:06:36.48
Do you get it, check it?

1161
01:06:36.48 --> 01:06:38.12
Don't, you come up with a better word.

1162
01:06:38.12 --> 01:06:39.12
Right?

1163
01:06:39.12 --> 01:06:42.84
Don't just put another very on that thing to give it another level of goodness.

1164
01:06:42.84 --> 01:06:43.84
Yeah.

1165
01:06:43.84 --> 01:06:46.68
Yeah, that's what, that's, that's a beautiful thing.

1166
01:06:46.68 --> 01:06:47.80
That's a way it should be.

1167
01:06:47.80 --> 01:06:48.80
Right.

1168
01:06:48.80 --> 01:06:54.28
That way should be, people should be learning more words, our vocabulary should be growing.

1169
01:06:54.28 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah, you know what's interesting.

1170
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Very interesting.

1171
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Very interesting.

1172
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.24
What, what's the next word?

1173
01:07:02.24 --> 01:07:03.24
What's the next word?

1174
01:07:03.24 --> 01:07:04.24
Be fastened.

1175
01:07:04.24 --> 01:07:05.24
We'll go fastened.

1176
01:07:05.24 --> 01:07:07.000
No, interesting kind of seemed ambiguous.

1177
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.80
Like it's interesting in a good way or a bad way.

1178
01:07:08.80 --> 01:07:13.80
You know, fascinating is like it's like wonderfully interesting.

1179
01:07:13.80 --> 01:07:14.80
Okay.

1180
01:07:14.80 --> 01:07:16.12
Is that what one of their says?

1181
01:07:16.12 --> 01:07:18.68
No, maybe, I don't know, certain levels.

1182
01:07:18.68 --> 01:07:28.28
levels. Anyway, even in slang, we have that, you know? Like even like, I can think

1183
01:07:28.28 --> 01:07:32.44
for an example strangely, but you know, like I was saying, like you'll have it, like, oh,

1184
01:07:32.44 --> 01:07:38.52
yeah, you're, okay, these are all swear words, so I don't want to do that example, but

1185
01:07:38.52 --> 01:07:45.88
you can be like, oh, yeah, he's cool or he's, um, whack, whack, or he's, uh, or he's, you know,

1186
01:07:45.88 --> 01:07:49.80
and there's all these escalating levels of higher arcades of confidence. Yeah, you know, so you

1187
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:56.20
could say, oh, yeah, he's cool or he could say he's very cool or he can say he's like, the

1188
01:07:56.20 --> 01:08:00.92
he's, I don't know, I just made that up or what, I didn't make it up. He's out of it, but, you know,

1189
01:08:00.92 --> 01:08:07.88
how like there's different slang words for different degrees of the sentence. So even slang has an escalating

1190
01:08:07.88 --> 01:08:14.12
hierarchy of words to explain things. Yeah, the expanded slang vocabulary exists as well.

1191
01:08:14.12 --> 01:08:20.20
Uh, now we get into the bevo vocabulary. The bevo vocabulary consisted of words which have been deliberately

1192
01:08:20.20 --> 01:08:26.12
constructed for political purposes, words that is to say, which not only had every case in every case

1193
01:08:26.76 --> 01:08:32.68
a political implication, but we're intended to impose desirable, a desirable mental attitude on the

1194
01:08:32.68 --> 01:08:38.60
person using them without a full understanding of the principles of insocket was difficult to use

1195
01:08:38.60 --> 01:08:43.72
these words correctly. And some cases they could be translated into old speak or even in a words taken

1196
01:08:43.72 --> 01:08:50.76
from avo vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain

1197
01:08:50.76 --> 01:08:57.56
overtones. The be words were a sort of verbal shorthand often packing whole ranges of ideas into

1198
01:08:57.56 --> 01:09:04.76
a few syllables and at the same time more accurate and forceful than ordinary language. The be words were

1199
01:09:04.76 --> 01:09:12.92
in all cases compound words. They consisted of two more words or portions of words welded together

1200
01:09:12.92 --> 01:09:22.36
in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting was always a noun verb and inflected according to

1201
01:09:22.36 --> 01:09:30.20
the ordinary rules to take a simple example. The word good think, meaning very roughly orthodoxy

1202
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:37.000
or if one choose to regard it as a verb to think in an orthodox manner, this inflected as follows.

1203
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.84
noun verb, good think, the past tense and past participle, good think, present participle,

1204
01:09:42.84 --> 01:09:48.28
good thinking, adjective, good thinkful and adverb, good think wise, verbal noun, good thinker.

1205
01:09:49.72 --> 01:09:59.64
The be words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which they were made up

1206
01:09:59.64 --> 01:10:03.96
could be parts of any speech, could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way,

1207
01:10:03.96 --> 01:10:10.44
which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivatives. In the word crime think,

1208
01:10:11.80 --> 01:10:17.88
thought crime, for instance, the think came second whereas in think poll which was the thought police,

1209
01:10:18.44 --> 01:10:22.92
it came first and in the latter the word police had lost its second syllable.

1210
01:10:23.72 --> 01:10:30.52
Because the great difficulty in making it sound good, irregular formations were commoner

1211
01:10:30.52 --> 01:10:35.80
in the bevel capital of the nevel capital. For example, adjective forms of miniature,

1212
01:10:36.52 --> 01:10:44.12
are sorry, mini true, mini packs, mini love were respectively the ministry of true,

1213
01:10:44.12 --> 01:10:48.28
mini truthful, mini peaceful, mini lovely simply because truthful,

1214
01:10:48.28 --> 01:10:54.76
powerful and lovely, loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce. He went deep on this.

1215
01:10:54.76 --> 01:11:01.16
Some of the be words had highly sub-tallized meetings,

1216
01:11:02.44 --> 01:11:06.60
subtleized meetings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered languages, a whole

1217
01:11:06.60 --> 01:11:13.64
consider for example the typical sentence from a times leading article as old thinker's unbelly

1218
01:11:13.64 --> 01:11:21.72
feel in shock. The shortest rendering that could make this of, that one could make of this

1219
01:11:21.72 --> 01:11:26.76
and old speak would be those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full

1220
01:11:26.76 --> 01:11:31.88
emotional understanding of the principles of English socialism. So that whole sentence gets translated

1221
01:11:31.88 --> 01:11:46.84
into old thinkers, unbelly feel in shock. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of new

1222
01:11:46.84 --> 01:11:52.68
speak of the new speak dictionary was not to invent new words but having invented them to make

1223
01:11:52.68 --> 01:11:58.36
sure what they meant to make sure that is to say what ranges of words they canceled because of their

1224
01:11:58.36 --> 01:12:02.36
existence. If you made up a new word, I had to get rid of a bunch of other words. Yeah,

1225
01:12:03.96 --> 01:12:09.96
we have already seen that in the case of the word free words which had once borne a heretical,

1226
01:12:10.52 --> 01:12:15.80
heretical, that's the meaning where sometimes retained for the sake of convenience,

1227
01:12:15.80 --> 01:12:19.64
but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.

1228
01:12:21.64 --> 01:12:25.48
Other words such as honor, justice, morality,

1229
01:12:26.12 --> 01:12:31.72
internationalism, democracy, science and religion had simply ceased to exist.

1230
01:12:33.40 --> 01:12:40.44
A few blanket words covered them and in covering them abolished them. All words grouping

1231
01:12:40.44 --> 01:12:45.32
themselves around the concepts of liberty and equality for instance were contained,

1232
01:12:45.32 --> 01:12:51.88
contained in the single word crime think. While all words grouping themselves around the concepts

1233
01:12:51.88 --> 01:12:57.40
of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word old think.

1234
01:13:05.72 --> 01:13:12.44
That's really disturbing to think about just the fact that you take the get rid of the words

1235
01:13:12.44 --> 01:13:17.48
and now how do we even teach it to your kids?

1236
01:13:20.76 --> 01:13:24.92
Greater precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a party member was an

1237
01:13:24.92 --> 01:13:30.84
outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew without knowing much else that all

1238
01:13:30.84 --> 01:13:37.000
nations other than his own worshiped false gods. He did not need to know that these gods were called

1239
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:45.72
Baal Osiris Maluk and the like. Probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy.

1240
01:13:46.68 --> 01:13:54.60
That's a very cool explanation. He knew Jehovah and the commanders of Jehovah. He knew

1241
01:13:54.60 --> 01:13:59.56
therefore that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods.

1242
01:14:00.68 --> 01:14:06.92
In some of the same way the party member knew what constituted right conduct and in exceedingly

1243
01:14:06.92 --> 01:14:11.96
vague generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible.

1244
01:14:12.60 --> 01:14:16.76
But you only know that and everything else is just bad. Everything else is false. Everything else is

1245
01:14:16.76 --> 01:14:17.80
lie. That's all you need to know.

1246
01:14:22.52 --> 01:14:26.52
No be word. No word in the be vocabularies ideologically neutral.

1247
01:14:27.72 --> 01:14:34.28
A great many name names were euphemisms. Words such words for instance as joy camp

1248
01:14:34.28 --> 01:14:42.44
which was a forced labor camp or mini packs which is the ministry of war which is the ministry of

1249
01:14:42.44 --> 01:14:47.16
peace is what it was short for but it really meant the ministry of war meant almost the exact

1250
01:14:47.16 --> 01:14:51.40
opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words on the other hand displayed a frank and contemptuous

1251
01:14:51.40 --> 01:14:58.04
understanding of the real nature of oceanic society an example of this pro-feed meaning the

1252
01:14:58.04 --> 01:15:04.84
rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses. Other words

1253
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:11.40
again were ambivalent having the connotation good when applied to the party and bad when applied

1254
01:15:11.40 --> 01:15:18.28
to its enemies. Good thinking, bad thinking. But in addition there were great numbers of words which

1255
01:15:18.28 --> 01:15:23.88
at first sight appeared to be mirror abbreviations and which derived their ideological color

1256
01:15:23.88 --> 01:15:37.08
not from their meaning but from their structure. Fast forward a little bit. Talks start talking

1257
01:15:37.08 --> 01:15:42.20
about in the ministry of truth for example the records department in which Winston Smith works

1258
01:15:42.20 --> 01:15:48.76
worked was called the wrecked-depp. The fictional department was called the Fick-depp. The teleprograms

1259
01:15:48.76 --> 01:15:54.68
department was called the teledepp and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time.

1260
01:15:54.68 --> 01:16:00.12
Even in the early decades of the 20th century telescope words and phrases had been one of

1261
01:16:00.12 --> 01:16:05.96
characteristic features of political language and it had been noticed that the tendency to use

1262
01:16:05.96 --> 01:16:12.76
abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarianism countries and totalitarian

1263
01:16:12.76 --> 01:16:23.40
organizations. Examples were such words as Nazi Gestapo, common turn, adjiprop. In the beginning the

1264
01:16:23.40 --> 01:16:30.52
practice had been adopted as it were instinctively but new speak but when a new speak it was used

1265
01:16:30.52 --> 01:16:38.36
with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed the

1266
01:16:38.36 --> 01:16:44.60
subtlety altered and altered its meaning by cutting out most of the associations that would

1267
01:16:44.60 --> 01:16:51.56
otherwise cling to it. That's very interesting. The words communist international for instance

1268
01:16:52.12 --> 01:16:58.20
call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood red flags, barricades,

1269
01:16:58.20 --> 01:17:03.88
Karl Marx and the Paris commune. The word common turn on the other hand suggests merely a

1270
01:17:03.88 --> 01:17:10.52
tight knit organization of well-defined body of doctrine. It refers to something almost as easily

1271
01:17:10.52 --> 01:17:14.60
recognized and limited in purpose as a charitable. I don't know why I used common instrument

1272
01:17:14.60 --> 01:17:22.28
set of Nazis. It seems like Nazis is the like national socialism. Those two words have their own

1273
01:17:22.28 --> 01:17:30.76
meanings and you can attach a bunch of things to nationalism and socialism but when you put those

1274
01:17:30.76 --> 01:17:35.96
words together in Germany and Nazi, it doesn't get more obvious that we just made something different

1275
01:17:35.96 --> 01:17:41.96
and like you say it makes it a tight group. It removes all the other things that can hang on to these

1276
01:17:41.96 --> 01:17:51.000
words. In the same way the associations called up by a word like Minitru are fewer and more

1277
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.04
controllable than those called up by ministry of truth. This accounted for the habit, not only the

1278
01:17:58.04 --> 01:18:03.80
habit of abbreviating whenever possible but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to

1279
01:18:03.80 --> 01:18:19.000
make every word easily pronounced. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary

1280
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.76
or sometimes necessary to reflect before speaking but a party member called upon to make a

1281
01:18:24.76 --> 01:18:30.76
political or ethical judgment should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically

1282
01:18:30.76 --> 01:18:35.96
as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this. The language gave

1283
01:18:35.96 --> 01:18:41.48
him an almost foolproof instrument and the texture of the words and their harsh sound and certain

1284
01:18:41.48 --> 01:18:48.36
willfulness, willing willfulness, which was in a core with the spirit of being sock assisted

1285
01:18:48.36 --> 01:18:52.28
the process further. That little section that I was like remind me of what you see today when

1286
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:58.28
people just have their go-to terms that's what they're going to throw. They just have

1287
01:18:58.28 --> 01:19:14.28
they're just going to attack with the damn attack words. You know like I'm coming at you.

1288
01:19:14.28 --> 01:19:20.92
Right. You just hear it. What does buzzwords? That's what I was looking for.

1289
01:19:20.92 --> 01:19:26.60
What does it call it? Yeah, but they're coming at you with the cliche. Oh like oh that guy's a

1290
01:19:26.60 --> 01:19:33.80
comi, that guy's Nazi. You know they got you're just going to you know you're on the other side

1291
01:19:33.80 --> 01:19:41.000
cool. You're Nazi. Oh right like they kind of throw it all kind of into one almost like yeah

1292
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.64
here's here's my argument. You know you say hey, Jocco I think that there should be voter ID

1293
01:19:49.64 --> 01:19:55.40
in America and I say you're a Nazi. Right. That's kind of the same thing. And then basically

1294
01:19:55.40 --> 01:20:00.76
then all my friends start calling you a Nazi as well. Right. Right. And then I say well you know

1295
01:20:00.76 --> 01:20:07.48
echo I think that we should have you know some form of welfare to help people out and you're like

1296
01:20:07.48 --> 01:20:11.32
you're a comi and all your friends call me a comi. So that's like that's what I'm saying. That's what

1297
01:20:11.32 --> 01:20:15.80
that reminds me of. Good. Everybody should be able to spray forth the correct opinions. It's

1298
01:20:15.80 --> 01:20:29.40
automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. Correct opinion. Yep. Scary. Then you get into

1299
01:20:29.40 --> 01:20:34.44
the Cvo vocabulary and when you get into Cvo vocabulary there was indeed no word for science.

1300
01:20:34.44 --> 01:20:43.48
Any meaning that could possibly bear being already covered by the word inksach. So everything is

1301
01:20:43.48 --> 01:20:50.20
just it's just based on inksach and science that's just inksach. That's what they say is correct.

1302
01:20:50.20 --> 01:20:56.12
That's science. So you don't need all these other words. And Cvo vocabulary was supplementary

1303
01:20:56.12 --> 01:21:08.04
to others and consistently of scientific and technical terms. But like I said there's not too many of them.

1304
01:21:08.04 --> 01:21:16.44
Ideas in a call to inksach which is my costalingsach could be. It could only be entertained

1305
01:21:16.44 --> 01:21:24.52
in a vague wordless form. It could not only be named in very broad terms which lump together and

1306
01:21:24.52 --> 01:21:32.28
condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them and doing so. So it's kind of similar to

1307
01:21:32.28 --> 01:21:40.52
what I just said. Oh you you want you you're you're you're you're you're conservative you're not

1308
01:21:40.52 --> 01:21:45.96
see oh you're a liberal you're a comedy. That's the same thing right. Your whole group is just

1309
01:21:45.96 --> 01:21:56.04
Nazis. Your whole group is just comics. That's where we're at. The concept of political equality

1310
01:21:56.04 --> 01:22:02.36
no longer existed. And this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal.

1311
01:22:05.96 --> 01:22:11.72
In 1984 when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication that danger theoretically existed

1312
01:22:11.72 --> 01:22:18.28
that in using new speak words one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was not

1313
01:22:18.28 --> 01:22:23.56
difficult for any person to be well grounded in double think to avoid doing this but within a lapse

1314
01:22:23.56 --> 01:22:26.76
within a couple generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished.

1315
01:22:28.28 --> 01:22:31.72
So they're going to get rid of the language over time like my kid might remember the other

1316
01:22:31.72 --> 01:22:37.24
meaning of the word free but his kids are maybe maybe his kids but maybe by the time you get

1317
01:22:37.24 --> 01:22:45.48
two generations were good no more freedom not even not even a thought. Getting to the end here

1318
01:22:45.48 --> 01:22:50.36
when Oldspeak and I'm fast forwarding through a bunch of stuff when Oldspeak had been once and for

1319
01:22:50.36 --> 01:22:56.84
all superseded the last link with the past would have been severed. So if they could have gotten

1320
01:22:56.84 --> 01:23:04.36
control the language they would have made it. History had already been rewritten but fragments of

1321
01:23:04.36 --> 01:23:10.92
the literature of the past survived here and there in perfectly censored. They didn't quite get rid

1322
01:23:10.92 --> 01:23:18.12
of all the language and so long as one retained one's knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible or read them.

1323
01:23:19.40 --> 01:23:24.28
In the future such fragments even if they are chance to survive would be unintelligible and

1324
01:23:24.28 --> 01:23:30.44
untranslatable. It was possible to translate any past of Oldspeak in a new speak unless it

1325
01:23:30.44 --> 01:23:37.48
either referred to some technical process or some very simple notes at this very simple

1326
01:23:37.48 --> 01:23:42.44
every day action was already Orthodox. Good thankful would be the new speak of expression and

1327
01:23:42.44 --> 01:23:50.36
tendency. In practice this meant no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a

1328
01:23:50.36 --> 01:23:57.16
whole. Pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation that is

1329
01:23:57.16 --> 01:24:02.60
alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known passage from the declaration

1330
01:24:02.60 --> 01:24:07.96
of independence we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are

1331
01:24:07.96 --> 01:24:14.12
endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the

1332
01:24:14.12 --> 01:24:20.52
pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their

1333
01:24:20.52 --> 01:24:28.84
powers from the consent of the governed. That whatever any form of government becomes destructive

1334
01:24:28.84 --> 01:24:36.68
of those ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and so to institute new government.

1335
01:24:38.44 --> 01:24:45.08
It would have been quite impossible to render this into new speak while keeping it to the sense

1336
01:24:45.08 --> 01:24:52.04
of the original. The nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up

1337
01:24:52.04 --> 01:25:01.56
in the single word crime thing. The whole thing was just crime speak.

1338
01:25:05.24 --> 01:25:09.56
Goes on here a good deal of the literature the past was indeed already being transformed this

1339
01:25:09.56 --> 01:25:14.44
way considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical

1340
01:25:14.44 --> 01:25:20.92
figures while at the same time bridging their achievements into line with the philosophy of Innsac.

1341
01:25:21.72 --> 01:25:27.000
Various writers such as Shakespeare Milton Swift, Byron Dickens and some of the others were

1342
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.68
therefore in the process of translation. When the task had been completed their original writings

1343
01:25:32.68 --> 01:25:38.60
with all else that survived of the literature of the past would be destroyed. These translations

1344
01:25:38.60 --> 01:25:43.64
were a slow difficult business and it was not expected that they would be finished before the

1345
01:25:43.64 --> 01:25:50.76
first or second decade of the 21st century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian

1346
01:25:50.76 --> 01:25:55.32
literature indispensable technical manuals and the like that had to be treated the same way.

1347
01:25:56.12 --> 01:26:01.80
It was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final

1348
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:13.40
adoption of new speak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050. So there you go that's this

1349
01:26:13.40 --> 01:26:20.36
and this that's a step-in-ex and you can see that they failed. They failed to change the language

1350
01:26:21.64 --> 01:26:30.76
which means they failed to get control of speech. They failed to to ban free thought because of that

1351
01:26:30.76 --> 01:26:45.48
and because of that they failed to successfully enslave the world in their tyranny. So very

1352
01:26:48.12 --> 01:26:59.88
very scary document and that's the language. That's the control of the language based on

1353
01:26:59.88 --> 01:27:09.000
reality based on history, the language control of the government of a dystopian future and

1354
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:19.24
you can see it's amazing how close or well got it and as cowboy warned us it's

1355
01:27:19.24 --> 01:27:29.96
something we need to watch out for and we can't control everything but we need to control we can

1356
01:27:29.96 --> 01:27:38.92
and go back to the beginning of this that's why we don't have sponsors here who might limit what we say

1357
01:27:38.92 --> 01:27:46.68
or limit what we talked to or limit who we talked to that's why this podcast right here what we're

1358
01:27:46.68 --> 01:27:55.88
doing that's why it's open and it's free for everyone so that as many people's possible here

1359
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:09.56
the lessons of history here the reflections of human nature in the past so we can all learn and we

1360
01:28:09.56 --> 01:28:22.12
can remember what's happened in the past so we don't repeat it so we've managed to maintain control

1361
01:28:22.12 --> 01:28:27.80
of that but we don't really have control of everything here and one of the things that we don't

1362
01:28:27.80 --> 01:28:33.48
have control of is the platforms that we come out on and we rely obviously we rely heavily on the

1363
01:28:33.48 --> 01:28:43.32
platforms and the platforms have been good to us for the most part so far all the platforms wherever

1364
01:28:43.32 --> 01:28:51.32
you're listening this right now we even treat you well it's been good but at the same time

1365
01:28:52.76 --> 01:28:58.68
any of those platforms that we published this podcast on could they could actually shut us down

1366
01:28:58.68 --> 01:29:07.48
if they wanted to they could pull the plug they could hold us hostage and I don't like that

1367
01:29:07.48 --> 01:29:18.52
and and we don't like that so we did some contingency planning little contingency planning look

1368
01:29:18.52 --> 01:29:22.36
hope what's what's the purpose of contingency hopefully you don't need to use a contingency

1369
01:29:22.36 --> 01:29:32.76
plan that's the hope is that you don't need to use a contingency plan but if we have to we we we

1370
01:29:32.76 --> 01:29:37.56
we figured we better do some contingency planning just in case so we're going to we're

1371
01:29:38.36 --> 01:29:46.44
putting together our own platform as a contingency setting up our own network or

1372
01:29:46.44 --> 01:29:55.32
I guess reinforcing it being prepared if we have to or we hope it doesn't go that way but we'll be

1373
01:29:55.32 --> 01:30:02.76
ready to we will have a little sovereign land of our own echo Charles our own little sovereign

1374
01:30:02.76 --> 01:30:13.16
little area little digital land little autonomous place that we we will have control over

1375
01:30:13.16 --> 01:30:23.48
that we can do we want and echo has been working hard on this right to put this together

1376
01:30:25.24 --> 01:30:32.04
a place where we can muster if we have to place we can bring our friends their podcast if we need to

1377
01:30:32.04 --> 01:30:38.60
a place where we can talk and we can argue and we can theorize the place where we can dissent

1378
01:30:38.60 --> 01:30:47.64
we can subvert and we can rebel a place where we're free a place where we are free to do

1379
01:30:47.64 --> 01:30:52.44
what we want to do in case we need it

1380
01:30:56.36 --> 01:30:59.24
okay so sounds fired up to me actually

1381
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:07.56
what does it mean pragmatically so like I said echo has been for the past few weeks putting together

1382
01:31:07.56 --> 01:31:17.40
some the the actual sovereign world the the underground the the death core underground

1383
01:31:20.84 --> 01:31:25.40
doing the technical work besides just pressing record echo has skills

1384
01:31:26.12 --> 01:31:31.88
a separate so so so what we set up what echo is set up because pretty much I didn't do anything

1385
01:31:31.88 --> 01:31:36.12
besides like say we better do this just in case and echo said Roger that so

1386
01:31:36.12 --> 01:31:44.60
a separate un underground a podcast feed that's underground right

1387
01:31:47.80 --> 01:31:56.28
separate underground forum a separate underground kind of way to communicate to us

1388
01:31:58.12 --> 01:32:04.28
and listen this podcast that we're doing right here the jockel podcast this will remain

1389
01:32:04.28 --> 01:32:11.96
free and available to all for as long as it is allowed to be free in a web I will never change

1390
01:32:11.96 --> 01:32:18.52
that by my own volition and believe me we have had opportunity upon opportunity to

1391
01:32:19.48 --> 01:32:29.56
do that to go behind the fire wall pay well the pay wall and we haven't done that

1392
01:32:29.56 --> 01:32:34.60
and we won't do that so as long as this as long as we're allowed to do this we'll do it

1393
01:32:36.12 --> 01:32:40.12
but if but we do need to have contingency planning if you want to get in the game if you want

1394
01:32:40.12 --> 01:32:47.80
to support the underground that will be appreciated and and in order like when we do that

1395
01:32:47.80 --> 01:32:52.92
in order we got to give something you know to kind of show our appreciation we'll do some

1396
01:32:52.92 --> 01:33:03.000
things on the underground to you know show our appreciation now maybe some additional sort of podcast

1397
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.96
things maybe some podcasts that don't fit in the typical format of a usual jockel podcast because

1398
01:33:09.96 --> 01:33:18.12
that's one thing that you know I think of that the I try might maintain a consistency with the

1399
01:33:18.12 --> 01:33:22.92
jockel podcast that when you press play you kind of know what you're getting or at least have some idea

1400
01:33:22.92 --> 01:33:27.96
so for me to throw something that's you know really uh maybe a lot shorter maybe it's a different

1401
01:33:27.96 --> 01:33:33.80
subject matter maybe it's some kind of current event space thing whatever I don't know but

1402
01:33:34.60 --> 01:33:40.60
we'll be able to do that we'll be able to do whatever we want because we will have pure

1403
01:33:40.60 --> 01:33:48.92
pure freedom we'll answer questions pride you some Q&A a little bit more because you know at

1404
01:33:48.92 --> 01:33:53.96
that some point if you recall the early days the podcast it was like hey I could just respond to

1405
01:33:53.96 --> 01:33:57.32
you on Twitter which I would because it would just say oh you ask a question cool I'll just answer

1406
01:33:57.32 --> 01:34:01.08
you oh and if it was a good question maybe you're going on the podcast and answer it but that

1407
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:06.12
became overwhelming because there's just too many questions to answer them all having me done a Q&A

1408
01:34:06.12 --> 01:34:15.40
in a while so we'll do some Q&A type stuff this is you know so you can ask questions direct

1409
01:34:18.12 --> 01:34:22.20
now you were saying something about like doing some kind of live connections yeah

1410
01:34:24.04 --> 01:34:29.88
if we choose to yeah so if people want it well it's we meet the proverb you all of us if we

1411
01:34:29.88 --> 01:34:36.28
need that's our choice yes yeah so that's what we're doing obviously we'll be open to

1412
01:34:36.28 --> 01:34:45.88
whatever suggestion you know you got so that's what we're doing well we got to pay for it

1413
01:34:45.88 --> 01:34:52.28
there's gonna be a little price to pay for freedom we came up with a pricing number

1414
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:58.92
if you can figure out the layers of this number what will they win let's let's

1415
01:34:58.92 --> 01:35:06.04
this needs to be rewarded if you can fit I bet someone can figure it out the if you if you

1416
01:35:06.04 --> 01:35:14.92
you want to join eight dollars and eighteen cents a month and if you can figure out the layers

1417
01:35:14.92 --> 01:35:22.28
between the behind eight eighteen let us know you'll win something something yeah they're cool something

1418
01:35:22.28 --> 01:35:27.000
it'll be a cool something do you think it's so obvious that everyone will figure it out it's very

1419
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.32
possible okay so maybe if depending on how many people get let's say this the first three people

1420
01:35:34.52 --> 01:35:39.40
that get it will be rewarded but that way you know look a little bit of a little bit of

1421
01:35:39.40 --> 01:35:44.84
a cost for freedom that way we can invest in all these different things we want to do and by the way

1422
01:35:44.84 --> 01:35:51.24
if you're freaked out or you're like ah money grab and whatever cool no no factor if you can't

1423
01:35:51.24 --> 01:36:01.80
afford that if it's too much we we want you to listen echo will take care of you he's writing

1424
01:36:01.80 --> 01:36:08.04
down that email right now because you've just made it up you will have it live and yeah but if you

1425
01:36:08.04 --> 01:36:12.36
can't afford a chip in that's awesome too and we appreciate it there's also you know talking

1426
01:36:12.36 --> 01:36:17.08
some other friends right now that have other podcasts about you know given them the same kind of

1427
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:21.72
bringing them into the fold and that's what we're at and like I said I hope it doesn't come

1428
01:36:21.72 --> 01:36:30.76
to a point where you need to go full death core underground but we prepare we make contingency

1429
01:36:30.76 --> 01:36:40.20
plans and we execute so we'll do some cool stuff and we'll be ready one more excerpt from 1984 here's

1430
01:36:40.20 --> 01:36:49.88
the quote don't you see that the whole aim of new speak is to narrow the range of thought in the end

1431
01:36:49.88 --> 01:36:57.96
we shall make far crime literally impossible because there will be no words in which to express it and

1432
01:36:57.96 --> 01:37:17.56
quote well we will maintain the words and we will maintain our freedom echo yes sir so how do people

1433
01:37:17.56 --> 01:37:26.76
join the jockel death core underground go to jockel underground dot com that's it just made up that's all you

1434
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:33.32
didn't go there and that's where you can join if you want there you go cool kind of crazy what it

1435
01:37:33.32 --> 01:37:42.20
well so obviously we're not just sitting around waiting for a dystopian future tube to be delivered

1436
01:37:42.20 --> 01:37:48.36
on to us we're preparing for yes we also got prepared for other things in life yeah we want to be

1437
01:37:48.36 --> 01:37:54.84
prepared we want to have capabilities yes what do you recommend so okay so bad and I

1438
01:37:55.96 --> 01:38:02.04
vaguely heard of this book 19 series crazy enough I don't know maybe I don't know maybe I'm

1439
01:38:02.04 --> 01:38:08.92
quiet that's just not how okay I don't know maybe I missed it okay but it's really interesting because

1440
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:13.72
like they're little parts of that like we all of that stuff that they're doing and trying to do

1441
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:19.40
whatever we do that in little ways and it's actually the thing is it's useful and it's actually

1442
01:38:19.40 --> 01:38:24.04
beneficial in a lot of ways as long as it's not across the board this is what you're doing

1443
01:38:24.04 --> 01:38:29.88
like you lost me there when you want to make things binary which we talked about on the

1444
01:38:29.88 --> 01:38:35.16
last episode actually that's completely different things it's a small one the same concept

1445
01:38:35.16 --> 01:38:39.80
except it's used for good so like dude you're getting wrapped around the fact that you have

1446
01:38:39.80 --> 01:38:44.60
a computer programming mind and you want to take the English language and put it into a totally

1447
01:38:44.60 --> 01:38:50.36
formatted system this doesn't again again if it's across the board you know why it doesn't

1448
01:38:50.36 --> 01:38:54.92
work I'll tell you why it doesn't work it's like you did to languages like the English languages

1449
01:38:54.92 --> 01:38:59.64
like you did to words come into it and they get adapted into it if they're good if they work if

1450
01:38:59.64 --> 01:39:03.80
they don't then they get to shut down oh yeah fully and then the same thing with like methodology

1451
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:09.000
in general so if you like okay so the binary thing right binary thing they're they're implementing

1452
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.16
that in language across the board that concept anyway across the board that's bad but you can use

1453
01:39:15.16 --> 01:39:22.36
that in specific nuanced ways to make it like a more efficient situation like working out or

1454
01:39:22.36 --> 01:39:28.20
something like that where okay so I was working out today actually something tells me you just

1455
01:39:28.20 --> 01:39:35.40
want to tell me this story and you're giving some kind of a no no so this isn't exactly this is

1456
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:40.20
why this whole book is interesting it's it basically one of the many lessons or whatever it's like

1457
01:39:40.20 --> 01:39:45.64
you can take us a good thing and just take it too far if you implement it across the board

1458
01:39:45.64 --> 01:39:50.52
that's got to be a leader's a lot of this stuff yeah fully a lot of stuff again in teeny tiny

1459
01:39:50.52 --> 01:39:56.44
doses or use just like sparingly it's like it's good thing like salt really put a little bit of salt

1460
01:39:56.44 --> 01:40:01.88
on touch it's pretty nice okay but too much salt or you put all salt right your dead true

1461
01:40:01.88 --> 01:40:08.68
so anyway I'm working out and my little son he's like four now he's doing you know he's

1462
01:40:08.68 --> 01:40:12.68
he's copying more and trying to understand and and actively understanding like but he's

1463
01:40:12.68 --> 01:40:16.12
kettlebell swings yeah he was doing little kids like the kettlebell swings don't back

1464
01:40:16.12 --> 01:40:23.16
you know I don't want them to quite do my daughter does them or wants to do them whatever

1465
01:40:23.16 --> 01:40:28.04
I don't I don't know I don't need her like sleeping and bashing her shin with that little kettle

1466
01:40:28.04 --> 01:40:33.08
I don't know anyway burpees all the yeah we can talk about that offline yes or any of us

1467
01:40:33.08 --> 01:40:37.80
having your kids you kettlebell swings is a good thing seems like beneficial yeah okay cool

1468
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.40
work on that coordination if we're worried about leg hits shin hits yes they're okay

1469
01:40:43.40 --> 01:40:52.84
makes sense to me so so my daughter was there and she was like talking about like how

1470
01:40:52.84 --> 01:40:55.72
her like because she went to that running thing what her leg is all sore and all the stuff me

1471
01:40:55.72 --> 01:41:00.44
while my son he's over getting after it or whatever right and he's like hey I'm doing this

1472
01:41:00.44 --> 01:41:05.72
or whatever so I can be strong so my daughter said listening so it's like yeah it's true

1473
01:41:05.72 --> 01:41:12.28
and you can understand in life answer me this what's better to be strong or weak strong these

1474
01:41:12.28 --> 01:41:16.92
they strong what's it better to know how to do something or did not know how to do something

1475
01:41:16.92 --> 01:41:21.000
is it to know how to do something so okay what's better to be healthy or unhealthy they say

1476
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.56
healthier whatever right so obviously life is there's way more to it than what's better

1477
01:41:25.56 --> 01:41:29.80
you kettlebell swings are not your kettlebell swings that's another one of the things

1478
01:41:29.80 --> 01:41:34.60
on the surface you say yeah kettlebell swings all day but the point is there's a lot more to it

1479
01:41:34.60 --> 01:41:42.28
than that but if I use that binary terminology just for that moment it's going to send a message

1480
01:41:42.28 --> 01:41:48.04
more effectively granted it's a good message at this point but you apply that across the board

1481
01:41:48.04 --> 01:41:53.96
you just eliminate understanding nuance all these important yes I get it I get it you're your

1482
01:41:53.96 --> 01:42:05.96
theory is accepted but it's really really you're you're taking like something massively destructive

1483
01:42:06.68 --> 01:42:11.56
and just taking a little tiny piece of it and said can't say that's good yeah like salt

1484
01:42:11.56 --> 01:42:17.80
okay I guess that we'll go with it but if if I have a steak come on jocco steak right all day

1485
01:42:17.80 --> 01:42:21.88
I'm gonna steak I put a little bit of salt on it because I make it better or worse in your opinion

1486
01:42:21.88 --> 01:42:29.32
in the synopinian can we put pepper on it too yes yes okay what if all the all salt you put the whole thing

1487
01:42:29.32 --> 01:42:33.08
good yeah actually let me start eliminating some of the stakes to make broom for more the salt

1488
01:42:33.08 --> 01:42:36.36
in fact at the end of the day let's remove the whole steak just salt and pepper or wait you

1489
01:42:36.36 --> 01:42:40.84
want in pepper right so it's all and pepper right your day it's not even good it's not even the same thing

1490
01:42:40.84 --> 01:42:47.96
same thing yeah I got it so a little bit it's good a lot of it so a little bit of language control inside

1491
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:52.92
your own family with your children trying to explain to them basic things like a binary decision

1492
01:42:52.92 --> 01:42:57.40
making process between good and bad in an immediate way right is it's a positive thing kind of

1493
01:42:57.40 --> 01:43:03.000
influence their thoughts first sure got it across the board maybe not just remind me not to let you

1494
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:11.08
become dictator we've run that game on the whole country yeah well there you go the world sure the world

1495
01:43:11.08 --> 01:43:18.84
too are it anyway speaking of working out yeah I worked out today we're expanding our capabilities

1496
01:43:18.84 --> 01:43:27.24
our strength our health all that stuff right that's what this path is so in the spirit of being

1497
01:43:27.24 --> 01:43:33.08
powerful you see what I'm doing there anyway we got supplements boom jockel fuel we got stuff

1498
01:43:33.08 --> 01:43:38.20
for you join so you have to think about them aching anymore you have to worry about thinking about

1499
01:43:38.20 --> 01:43:44.52
them aching anymore thinking about that stuff won't even exist it'll be impossible to think

1500
01:43:44.52 --> 01:43:53.40
even think about it those stop crimes etc anyway joint warfare also super krill oil these things

1501
01:43:53.40 --> 01:44:01.56
help you join to keep you in the game even as we age through this human existence also discipline

1502
01:44:01.56 --> 01:44:07.40
and discipline go it's for your mind everybody too it's a daily thing I think but yes

1503
01:44:07.40 --> 01:44:12.52
enhance your cognitive capabilities as far as capabilities go have you improved your routine

1504
01:44:12.52 --> 01:44:16.28
where you're at a hundred percent on krill and then enjoy warfare with no

1505
01:44:16.28 --> 01:44:25.48
no holes in your game lapses you did you just use a word hundred percent yeah no no how can you

1506
01:44:25.48 --> 01:44:29.96
not dig that once you just put them when you brush your teeth you take it you know well I thought

1507
01:44:29.96 --> 01:44:34.60
we covered that before as far as the brushing the teeth part because the routine is it's nuanced

1508
01:44:34.60 --> 01:44:46.68
anyway it's because to really point it out it's when the whole covid thing came to my shores

1509
01:44:47.88 --> 01:44:54.44
I was like I grabbed the vitamin D3 in the cold war I was like my mind shifted to that as the

1510
01:44:54.44 --> 01:45:00.04
priority and then it'd be like one day all I didn't take the krill oil you know not because like

1511
01:45:00.04 --> 01:45:05.08
before I'd make black delve like okay I'm just gonna take this now or whatever it's not as implemented

1512
01:45:05.08 --> 01:45:12.44
into the routine as it should be really crazy to me yeah really crazy to me that this is not a big

1513
01:45:12.44 --> 01:45:20.04
like thing that you could just do with the bottles next to your teeth bro you know what it is

1514
01:45:20.04 --> 01:45:25.72
no this is this is really what it is now that I'm like analyzing my whole mind because you're right

1515
01:45:25.72 --> 01:45:33.80
you're like we know it like helps you so much yeah yes so here's the thing I'm violating

1516
01:45:33.80 --> 01:45:39.80
two rules or maybe it's just one rule with different terms resting on my laurels and complacency

1517
01:45:39.80 --> 01:45:45.24
okay so you know how like bro my joints don't hurt so I'm not compelled to solve any problem

1518
01:45:45.24 --> 01:45:48.68
you see I'm saying but I'm not kind of taking my own advice you know how you like you know

1519
01:45:48.68 --> 01:45:55.80
I think about your days go by and then you do feel your joys oh it's like like for five six days you know

1520
01:45:55.80 --> 01:46:02.68
you go six days until it start feeling it yeah but oh I'm not like awful I don't have issues

1521
01:46:02.68 --> 01:46:08.12
right now but I'm just saying like as far as 100% daily the way that that one I when I do put it

1522
01:46:08.12 --> 01:46:13.000
together I'm just not doing that but I'm getting there but yeah no issues for sure but that's

1523
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.76
I think baby steps bro maybe we're getting there working on it or not on that discipline yeah so the

1524
01:46:18.76 --> 01:46:25.56
lesson there is even take I got to take my own advice we don't want to think about that

1525
01:46:25.56 --> 01:46:30.20
good stuff but the only way to not think about your joints hurting or hurting in the future is

1526
01:46:30.20 --> 01:46:37.08
to through discipline take them every day see now you're like that guy that's you know

1527
01:46:37.08 --> 01:46:46.44
given advice about something they're not actually doing yeah kind of just that I'll give you advice

1528
01:46:46.44 --> 01:46:55.40
hey take them every day there you go I don't know that I say take it every day I say take it

1529
01:46:55.40 --> 01:46:58.60
it so you don't know the worry about your joints but look I'm saying right now and I'm

1530
01:46:58.60 --> 01:47:02.52
starting doing it right now how about that next time you check in with me 100% I'm wondering

1609
01:55:26.52 --> 01:55:35.88
we have to preserve and I know that we don't do it perfectly but i do believe that in the

01:55:35.88 --> 01:55:41.56
battle of good versus evil and light versus dark and truth versus light i believe that truth

1611
01:55:41.56 --> 01:55:47.64
and light and good will prevail but there may be times of darkness and for those times we will be

1612

ready and we we may have to go underground at some point but we will never surrender and we will

1613
