00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.36
This is jockelpodcast number 159 with echo Charles and me jockelwillink

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening echo good evening

3
00:00:10.88 --> 00:00:12.88
There's a

4
00:00:14.56 --> 00:00:16.56
a terrible feeling

5
00:00:17.52 --> 00:00:19.52
in the gut

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that I've only felt

7
00:00:23.36 --> 00:00:25.36
while I was overseas in

8
00:00:25.36 --> 00:00:32.16
in Iraq and it's it's this

9
00:00:33.20 --> 00:00:37.36
deeply distressed kind of sick feeling

10
00:00:39.52 --> 00:00:41.36
and it literally feel it and you're gut

11
00:00:41.36 --> 00:00:44.64
literally feel it in your stomach and my stomach

12
00:00:44.88 --> 00:00:47.52
and it's not it's not the fear it's not fear

13
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:50.72
it's not it's not the fear of death

14
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:55.76
because when you get to a point

15
00:00:56.72 --> 00:00:59.52
when you kind of accept that death is a

16
00:01:00.64 --> 00:01:02.32
possibility and you're okay with it

17
00:01:03.12 --> 00:01:06.08
then that fear kind of goes away

18
00:01:08.80 --> 00:01:10.56
and it's not the fear

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.72
of one of your guys being wounded or killed

20
00:01:14.72 --> 00:01:16.000
it's not that either

21
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:18.000
because even that fear

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.68
even that fear you you kind of get a control of that fear

23
00:01:24.56 --> 00:01:28.000
because you know you can't dwell on it because you know if you do well on the fear

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.28
of one of your guys getting wounded or getting killed

25
00:01:31.28 --> 00:01:33.20
then that's going to detract from

26
00:01:34.16 --> 00:01:38.56
the very thing that you're supposed to be doing that will most likely prevent your

27
00:01:38.56 --> 00:01:40.56
guys from being wounded or killed

28
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:43.92
if you're dwelling on that fear

29
00:01:43.92 --> 00:01:46.48
you won't be doing the things you should be doing like planning

30
00:01:46.48 --> 00:01:50.80
and training and preparing and inspecting and reviewing and leading

31
00:01:52.56 --> 00:01:56.32
so even that fear while it's persistent and heavy

32
00:01:57.12 --> 00:02:00.80
and potent it's you have

33
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:03.44
some level of control over it

34
00:02:06.56 --> 00:02:10.72
but when something goes wrong when something

35
00:02:12.08 --> 00:02:12.56
happens

36
00:02:12.56 --> 00:02:14.56
and

37
00:02:15.52 --> 00:02:20.32
and your response bowl and the burden of command

38
00:02:20.32 --> 00:02:25.76
settles down with its monstrous monstrous weight on top of your shoulders

39
00:02:27.04 --> 00:02:28.40
because there's no one else to blame

40
00:02:29.76 --> 00:02:31.04
that's what I'm talking about

41
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:35.68
and actually I felt it for the first time really

42
00:02:36.96 --> 00:02:39.12
a little bit during my first deployment

43
00:02:39.12 --> 00:02:42.48
that I did to Iraq and my platoon we did what we were supposed

44
00:02:42.48 --> 00:02:44.48
to do some things

45
00:02:45.92 --> 00:02:49.52
didn't go right nothing crazy but mistakes were made

46
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:53.12
and there was actually back to back to back missions

47
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
with related targets that we were going after and I was the assault force commander

48
00:02:59.20 --> 00:03:02.40
and I think one of my might have been the ground force commander so

49
00:03:03.20 --> 00:03:07.28
I was clearly responsible for these missions and there were some mistakes made and

50
00:03:07.28 --> 00:03:11.68
my commanding officer came and

51
00:03:12.88 --> 00:03:17.84
spoke to me about it you know, pulled me aside to point out the mistakes and the

52
00:03:17.84 --> 00:03:20.88
resulting impacts that these mistakes were going to have

53
00:03:21.60 --> 00:03:23.04
and he wasn't happy I mean he wasn't

54
00:03:23.68 --> 00:03:27.12
he wasn't mad because we had a good relationship and he was talking to me just straight

55
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:30.16
but he wasn't happy

56
00:03:31.60 --> 00:03:36.56
and you know I kept the conface and I took ownership and said hey my fault

57
00:03:36.56 --> 00:03:38.56
this is the things we're going to do to fix it you know

58
00:03:41.60 --> 00:03:45.44
but even though I kind of kept a calm face in front of him when he left

59
00:03:45.44 --> 00:03:49.20
I again I felt like that's wretched in my stomach that

60
00:03:49.76 --> 00:03:51.84
that I had made some kind of mistake and

61
00:03:53.04 --> 00:03:56.24
and one of the worst things about us there's nothing you can do like the mistake happened

62
00:03:56.24 --> 00:03:58.08
you can't go back you can't fix it

63
00:03:58.08 --> 00:04:05.44
and I can't compare that feeling to anything else really that I've felt

64
00:04:06.72 --> 00:04:10.96
because I've never felt anything else that feels like that and I've talked about it with

65
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:17.20
my friends and leadership positions overseas and like actually the first time

66
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:21.36
it's actually stoner that talked to me about this this gut feeling

67
00:04:22.48 --> 00:04:25.44
and he had something going on and

68
00:04:25.44 --> 00:04:31.68
and he's like you know that feeling and I was like oh yeah I know that feeling

69
00:04:33.36 --> 00:04:36.24
and like I said I've never I've never felt this

70
00:04:36.96 --> 00:04:40.88
feeling this knowing feeling and you're gut that's eating you from the inside

71
00:04:40.88 --> 00:04:44.08
I think you see it sometimes

72
00:04:45.28 --> 00:04:49.60
if you watch you know some movies trying capture this feeling

73
00:04:49.60 --> 00:04:54.88
of where it's basically where someone's life is falling apart but they're trying to keep a

74
00:04:55.44 --> 00:04:57.44
facade up that everything's going okay

75
00:04:58.56 --> 00:04:59.92
have you ever seen the movie Fargo?

76
00:05:01.28 --> 00:05:06.16
no okay I got you on this one and this movie Fargo there's a guy and he's he's a

77
00:05:06.16 --> 00:05:09.68
car salesman and he's been fudging the numbers and then he's

78
00:05:10.72 --> 00:05:14.88
he's he's trying to kill someone there's all these things are happening and it's all

79
00:05:14.88 --> 00:05:22.24
and he's a very I would say a very naive person and he's you know married and he's got

80
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:27.20
kids and he's trying to do this stuff that's not right and he knows it and it's starting to

81
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:32.64
come apart and that that's the kind of thing where you can see it's just eating him from the

82
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:36.24
inside so I think it's that that type of

83
00:05:36.24 --> 00:05:41.04
knowing deep feeling where everything is going wrong and there's nothing you can do about it

84
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:46.80
that's the that's the closest I I think I can come is is just when things are going so wrong

85
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:53.28
and there's nothing you can do about it and I think that that feeling that feeling for me

86
00:05:54.48 --> 00:05:57.52
I think that's why I'd never want to that's why I always say combat is humbling

87
00:05:58.40 --> 00:06:01.20
it's because of that feeling right there where you

88
00:06:01.20 --> 00:06:06.56
some went wrong you couldn't stop it you couldn't control it you can't fix it it is what it is

89
00:06:06.56 --> 00:06:20.24
and that makes it humbling extremely humbling and because of that it made me want to make

90
00:06:20.24 --> 00:06:26.56
sure that I did everything humanly possible to prevent from that to prevent that feeling

91
00:06:26.56 --> 00:06:32.32
from grabbing hold of me again if if I could help it get opened up my mind it made me

92
00:06:32.32 --> 00:06:40.64
it made me always want to listen to other people's input because I always said to myself wait

93
00:06:40.64 --> 00:06:45.36
if I didn't see what was going on over here how do I ever know where my blind spots are

94
00:06:46.40 --> 00:06:51.04
I always think I must have blind spots somewhere there must be something I don't see

95
00:06:51.04 --> 00:06:56.72
something I don't understand how can I listen I need to make sure I listen to other people's

96
00:06:56.72 --> 00:07:02.96
viewpoints and perspectives so that I don't so I can cover and yeah cover as many blind spots

97
00:07:02.96 --> 00:07:12.88
as possible review other methods and other ideas and other principles to see what I could learn

98
00:07:12.88 --> 00:07:20.32
from them and when people raise opposing points to me I don't object to them I don't bristle up

99
00:07:20.32 --> 00:07:28.48
and it's it doesn't offend me when somebody says something that isn't that I don't agree with

100
00:07:28.48 --> 00:07:38.56
it doesn't offend me at all in fact I want to know more about it and as I as I go through my life

101
00:07:38.56 --> 00:07:44.80
I try and continue to listen I try to absorb opposing opinions and process them and I want to

102
00:07:44.80 --> 00:07:50.000
just understand them I want to understand the context of them I want to understand the perspective of them

103
00:07:51.12 --> 00:07:57.92
it's it's how I think I'm going to eliminate as many blind spots as possible so when someone would tell

104
00:07:57.92 --> 00:08:04.80
me like a new tactic right new tactic when I was in the in the teams and someone say hey we're doing this now

105
00:08:05.84 --> 00:08:10.88
and there's of course when somebody tells you something new there's always a part of you that says

106
00:08:10.88 --> 00:08:17.60
that bristles up to it and I again those humbling situations that feeling in my gut that I

107
00:08:17.60 --> 00:08:25.68
didn't want to feel it it pushed that ego down because I actually want to hear what your ideas I want

108
00:08:25.68 --> 00:08:30.64
to hear if this is a blind spot I haven't noticed I want I want that idea to work I want to see

109
00:08:30.64 --> 00:08:35.44
how it works I want to see if it works and sometimes they would work and it's any and I would learn

110
00:08:35.44 --> 00:08:41.84
something sometimes they wouldn't you know sometimes it would reconfirm the reason and then that person

111
00:08:41.84 --> 00:08:47.84
would learn hey the reason we don't do what you're wanting to do is because of this and so now I'm

112
00:08:47.84 --> 00:08:54.32
helping them with a blind spot that they might have but either way my goal was always to learn

113
00:08:57.04 --> 00:09:03.76
to hear other people's viewpoint and that's the way I remain today those other viewpoints are

114
00:09:03.76 --> 00:09:08.88
going to make me sharper I I'm going to read things so that I can see them from other angles

115
00:09:10.40 --> 00:09:15.92
understand things from other angles they can strike when you understand something from another

116
00:09:15.92 --> 00:09:21.36
angle you can strengthen your position or you can leave your position if you realize that your position

117
00:09:21.36 --> 00:09:29.60
is wrong and it's going to make me better and it's making me better not for me not because I want to

118
00:09:29.60 --> 00:09:34.08
be better but for the people that are around me the people up and down the chain of command that I'm

119
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:44.24
trying to support them so I can do my job better as a leader as a follower and as a person and also

120
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:57.12
so that I can as much as humanly possible avoid that wretched, seaving miserable feeling in my guts

121
00:10:00.80 --> 00:10:08.80
so I was thinking a lot about that and tonight we're going to explore some principles of war

122
00:10:08.80 --> 00:10:18.40
actually called general rules by this individual Mackey of Ellie this is the Mackey of Ellie

123
00:10:18.40 --> 00:10:26.24
Nicole Mackey of Ellie this is the guy that wrote the prince he's got all kinds of great quotes out there it's

124
00:10:26.24 --> 00:10:33.52
better to be feared than loved if you can if you cannot be both he's got never never was anything great

125
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:44.000
achieved without danger here's one if an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe

126
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.04
that his vengeance need not be feared that's pretty ruthless here's another one hence it comes

127
00:10:53.04 --> 00:11:04.000
about that all armed profits have been victorious and all unarmed profits have been destroyed in

128
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.16
one more quick quote as you you can you can just google Mackey of Ellie in quotes and you'll find

129
00:11:10.16 --> 00:11:17.28
a bunch of great ones men rise from one ambition to another first they seek to secure themselves against

130
00:11:17.28 --> 00:11:23.92
attack then they attack others and that's actually from the prince which is his most famous book

131
00:11:23.92 --> 00:11:30.56
and if you think about the process of being a human being that right there is very accurate

132
00:11:30.56 --> 00:11:36.40
and you can really see that with accuracy if you overlay that on jiu jitsu first you seek to

133
00:11:36.40 --> 00:11:41.20
secure yourself from attack and then you attack others right when you're rolling that first when you first

134
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:45.44
start you're just trying to defend yourself not to get children and then eventually you can stop

135
00:11:45.44 --> 00:11:49.04
from getting choked and you can stop from getting armed lock and start trying to attack those people

136
00:11:49.04 --> 00:11:55.12
and armed lock them so that's Mackey of Ellie and if you don't know anything about them he was an

137
00:11:55.12 --> 00:12:04.08
Italian really a politician and a diplomat and but on top of that this was during the Renaissance

138
00:12:04.08 --> 00:12:11.84
period and he's an actual Renaissance man so he was a poet he was a plot philosopher he's a playwright

139
00:12:11.84 --> 00:12:20.80
he was an author of books born in 1469 died in 1527 from 1503 to 1506 he was in charge of the

140
00:12:20.80 --> 00:12:27.60
Florentine militia and when he was in charge of that militia he didn't like mercenaries

141
00:12:28.80 --> 00:12:32.96
because he realized the weakness of mercenaries is that they they're they're getting paid that's

142
00:12:32.96 --> 00:12:39.84
why they're fighting they're not fighting big from their true belief system so he raised and recruited

143
00:12:39.84 --> 00:12:48.64
a citizen army and they were well respected on the battlefield and they fought in some pretty

144
00:12:48.64 --> 00:12:53.04
good battles and won but it didn't last forever for him was eventually defeated and dissolved

145
00:12:53.04 --> 00:12:59.68
the Mackey Valley was accused of conspiracy and tortured and of course whenever I

146
00:13:00.80 --> 00:13:05.52
I go down a lot of rabbit holes but I went down that torture rabbit hole for a little while yesterday

147
00:13:05.52 --> 00:13:12.56
and they pretty brutal about it but he they thought he was a conspirator or whatever he

148
00:13:12.56 --> 00:13:17.20
did he even after torture they couldn't get it out of them they eventually just exiled him

149
00:13:17.20 --> 00:13:21.76
and that's when he wrote his book the prince which I'm sure will cover on here at some point

150
00:13:21.76 --> 00:13:26.64
this is where you hear this is where the word Mackey Valley and you know that's kind of

151
00:13:26.64 --> 00:13:34.96
it usually refers to his book the prince and usually that word nowadays is used to describe

152
00:13:34.96 --> 00:13:39.84
someone that's kind of scheming and unscrupulous if like if you look it up in the dictionary that's

153
00:13:39.84 --> 00:13:45.12
it'll give you a definition along those lines like someone that's trying to snake and make things

154
00:13:45.12 --> 00:13:51.04
happy and happen but and like I said I'm sure we'll cover that book at some point but

155
00:13:53.84 --> 00:14:02.16
after that he wrote another book which is called the art of war and it's it's definitely a

156
00:14:02.16 --> 00:14:09.20
really good book it's and we will probably parse through the entire thing at some point but one

157
00:14:09.20 --> 00:14:15.60
thing that's good about it is in the end of the book he part seven of the book and there's yeah

158
00:14:15.60 --> 00:14:22.000
that's the last part of the book he basically breaks out the most important principles from the book

159
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.48
which makes it pretty easy and straightforward to talk into to explain them and and then you can

160
00:14:30.48 --> 00:14:34.80
get the details and like I said I'm sure we'll get granular at some point on it but

161
00:14:36.72 --> 00:14:44.56
here's what he says in this book he's and it's bear with me a little bit only because the

162
00:14:44.56 --> 00:14:51.76
the translation is old I know that I've told you many things which by yourself you might have

163
00:14:51.76 --> 00:14:58.24
understood and considered notwithstanding I have done it as today also I've told you for to be

164
00:14:58.24 --> 00:15:03.92
able to show you better meaning thereof the quality of this army and also to satisfy those if

165
00:15:03.92 --> 00:15:10.96
there be any whom have not had the same commodity to understand them as you nor me thinks that there

166
00:15:11.84 --> 00:15:18.80
are other to tell you then certain general rules the which you should have most familiar which

167
00:15:18.80 --> 00:15:24.64
be these which is his way of saying listen I wrote a lot of stuff I'm glad you understood it or at

168
00:15:24.64 --> 00:15:30.24
least you say you did but just in case some other people can't understand it I'm gonna break it down

169
00:15:30.24 --> 00:15:36.16
for you very simply in these general rules and and like I said the translation the translation

170
00:15:36.16 --> 00:15:41.92
that that I read of this book is called the Tudor translations by and it's translated by a guy

171
00:15:41.92 --> 00:15:48.80
named Peter Whitehorn in 1560 so we're talking like somewhat archaic language and it's a little

172
00:15:48.80 --> 00:15:54.88
bit tricky you know to get through but I'll talk through and we'll get it into an understandable

173
00:15:54.88 --> 00:16:05.92
format and there we go so like I said he says hey look I wrote a lot of stuff here's the general

174
00:16:05.92 --> 00:16:14.24
rules that you should be most familiar worth here we go number one the same that helpeth the enemy

175
00:16:14.24 --> 00:16:21.84
hurteth the and the same that helpeth the hurteth the enemy that one's pretty straightforward right

176
00:16:22.64 --> 00:16:28.40
what benefits the enemy harms you and what benefits you harms the enemy straightforward I think

177
00:16:28.40 --> 00:16:36.64
you know that's one of those common principles that across the ages everyone says and the

178
00:16:36.64 --> 00:16:44.08
reason they say that is because people forget it people forget that if if we're if we can

179
00:16:44.08 --> 00:16:48.32
hurt the enemy in any way it's helping us and anything we do that benefits us is going to hurt the

180
00:16:48.32 --> 00:16:58.64
enemy yeah so sometimes we forget that that's why many of these various canons of principles on war

181
00:16:59.36 --> 00:17:09.20
remind us of that because it's an important fact number two he that shall be in war most

182
00:17:09.20 --> 00:17:16.88
vigilant to observe the devices of the enemy and shall take most pain to exercise his army

183
00:17:16.88 --> 00:17:25.44
shall endure least perils and may hope most of victory so what does that mean that means pay attention

184
00:17:25.44 --> 00:17:32.72
that means be vigilant in observing the methods and plans of the enemy when you're in war number one

185
00:17:32.72 --> 00:17:42.48
pay attention to who you're fighting against understand who they are Andy Burke

186
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:51.20
he was going to do an EBI but it goes an EBI match you know he was going against

187
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:59.44
Craig Jones you know you only think about Craig Jones Craig Jones is savage Andy you know

188
00:17:59.44 --> 00:18:07.28
he's he's awesome but we know we're up we're training we're training hard he goes and compete

189
00:18:07.28 --> 00:18:14.40
against him and loses fast yeah why do you lose he lost because well number one because Craig Jones is

190
00:18:14.40 --> 00:18:20.64
awesome and you know what Andy's real good at he was good at all of the jiu jitsu but he's got real

191
00:18:20.64 --> 00:18:25.44
good footlocks got real good heel hooks he likes to play that game you know it's training with me

192
00:18:25.44 --> 00:18:32.32
training with the list and so he's rolling in didn't know much about Craig Jones in fact you didn't

193
00:18:32.32 --> 00:18:36.48
know anything about Craig Jones he just said oh yeah he's good whatever not not not in a

194
00:18:36.48 --> 00:18:43.68
disrespectful way but you ever heard somebody say like when they say what do you think about your

195
00:18:43.68 --> 00:18:48.40
opponents left hook or whatever what they say what do you think about your opponents grounded

196
00:18:48.40 --> 00:18:52.48
pound and they say I'm not worried about my opponent it's what I'm going to do it's not what

197
00:18:52.48 --> 00:18:56.48
they're going to do you know what I mean and I don't mean that in a bad way I'm not trying to say Andy was

198
00:18:56.48 --> 00:19:01.12
cocky but Andy's thing was like look you know I do jiu jitsu yeah that was his approach yeah like

199
00:19:01.12 --> 00:19:04.96
I do jiu jitsu and hey and also there's a little bit of like hey well you might go against this

200
00:19:04.96 --> 00:19:08.48
guy but he might get hurt or you might have this or whatever you know what I mean so and it was a

201
00:19:08.48 --> 00:19:13.44
tournament as well so you can't really get focused on one guy you're going to be fighting

202
00:19:13.44 --> 00:19:19.04
three or four guys in one night you just got to get your jiu jiu jitsu game up so Andy rolls in

203
00:19:19.04 --> 00:19:29.28
and he went right into Craig Jones's game in seconds and and the other thing was Andy super relaxed

204
00:19:29.28 --> 00:19:33.76
like I mean he's he's relaxed anyways so he's like oh okay this is you know we're just going to

205
00:19:33.76 --> 00:19:38.32
do some jiu jitsu and and it'll escalate over time and eventually you know something you know

206
00:19:38.32 --> 00:19:45.68
we'll get to that point and whatever and he goes in and boom and goes right into like one of Craig

207
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:55.28
Jones's like really good moves just goes right into it form and you know I was bummed and obviously

208
00:19:55.28 --> 00:20:02.000
Andy's bummed but didn't do any you know we me I should have been like hey man let's look at

209
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
your opponents let's check out their game because if you just know you know how it is if you're a

210
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.12
wear of someone's game you can definitely mitigate you can't defeat I'm not saying he could defeat

211
00:20:11.12 --> 00:20:16.56
Craig Jones but he would have been he wouldn't have fallen into that in a matter of seconds he would have

212
00:20:16.56 --> 00:20:20.88
been oh this is his move there I need I know what to do to at least mitigate the first attack the

213
00:20:20.88 --> 00:20:27.52
second attack right if you don't do that you're gonna you're gonna have problems and Andy got and he

214
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:34.56
came back and we that he's like he's like yeah that guy's good so props to my boy Craig Jones

215
00:20:34.56 --> 00:20:41.76
you beat my my boy hopefully you guys will meet again one day and you get a how get another go and

216
00:20:41.76 --> 00:20:49.76
he'll know your game a little bit better but bottom line is study your opponents study your opponents

217
00:20:49.76 --> 00:20:54.000
now can you go too far with that yeah you can because some people think oh I wish that happens

218
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.84
sometimes when the UFC's some little miswated they'll get hurt and they'll throw a new opponent

219
00:20:57.84 --> 00:21:01.52
man there was ready for that guy had been training for a strike or now you put me up against

220
00:21:01.52 --> 00:21:08.64
grappler or whatever so you know a serge this is pretty cool serge who was a really who was and

221
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:15.76
he is a really good wrestler he's also jujitsu now but he was he said when he would train for wrestling

222
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:20.08
you know because he was a high school wrestler at Powway which if you know anything about wrestling

223
00:21:20.08 --> 00:21:24.88
in California or actually in America you know Powway high school has a like real dominant wrestling

224
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:33.36
program and he was a wrestler there as well as his brother but he said when he would train he would

225
00:21:33.36 --> 00:21:40.40
picture someone with no face and it's because you know when you're in the high school wrestling

226
00:21:40.40 --> 00:21:44.08
scene out in California you know the people that you're gonna come up against right and it's

227
00:21:44.08 --> 00:21:48.56
tournament you're gonna come up against these six guys you know that two of them are good or whatever

228
00:21:48.56 --> 00:21:53.84
but he just say nope and then when he would look at him he's like when I would look at him before

229
00:21:53.84 --> 00:21:59.84
a match I wouldn't even I just see like a blur just fog in their face and then he said once he

230
00:21:59.84 --> 00:22:03.60
would knew he was gonna go against that guy then he'd look at him and calculate their face and

231
00:22:03.60 --> 00:22:11.52
be like I'm gonna kill this guy but that's the why what was his point in that was he didn't want

232
00:22:11.52 --> 00:22:20.32
to get like his mind offset by oh it's not who I expected it to be right so he wouldn't have any

233
00:22:20.32 --> 00:22:25.52
expectation on who was gonna be he was just gonna get in the murder mode and then when he

234
00:22:25.52 --> 00:22:29.44
finally realized that they're walking out of the map but then then he'd look at their face and

235
00:22:29.44 --> 00:22:34.24
go okay this is the guy I'm going against and I'm gonna kill him which for Sard you know that

236
00:22:34.24 --> 00:22:43.28
me he's the actual so observe the methods and plans of your enemy absolutely

237
00:22:43.28 --> 00:22:49.92
next part of his you you have to endure much hardship and training of course you got a train hard

238
00:22:49.92 --> 00:22:54.64
so observe your enemy no what they're doing and then train really really hard and you're gonna

239
00:22:54.64 --> 00:23:04.40
have a greater chance for victory of course common sense next one number three never conduct

240
00:23:04.40 --> 00:23:11.12
by men to fight the field if first that was not confirmed their minds and know it's them to be

241
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:19.60
without fear and to be in good order for though for thou audist never to enterprise any dangerous

242
00:23:19.60 --> 00:23:30.64
thing with thy soldiers but when thou seeest that they hope to overcome so again we're doing

243
00:23:30.64 --> 00:23:38.32
some middle English here I think you English linguists people can get at me if I'm wrong

244
00:23:38.32 --> 00:23:43.12
but we're pretty close to middle English maybe it's a little late middle English but we're in the

245
00:23:43.12 --> 00:23:48.24
ballpark so what is he talking about there? Never lead your soldiers into an engagement unless

246
00:23:48.80 --> 00:23:55.60
you are assured of their courage and then he actually says unless you know them to be without fear

247
00:23:55.60 --> 00:23:59.84
which is a stretch in my mind because you're gonna have people they're gonna be afraid in fact

248
00:23:59.84 --> 00:24:05.52
when you can you you're gonna people are gonna be afraid when they're going into combat 90

249
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:11.60
something percent a high percentage of people are gonna have some level of fear but you do need

250
00:24:11.60 --> 00:24:14.96
to make sure that they're gonna be able to overcome that fear so if you got people that are

251
00:24:14.96 --> 00:24:19.28
shaken in their shoes and they feel you know you think they're gonna do not they're not been tested at

252
00:24:19.28 --> 00:24:25.76
all well then that could be a real problem then then the question becomes okay well how do you

253
00:24:25.76 --> 00:24:31.20
test if someone's gonna be afraid or not what do you think they do in the military with people what

254
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:37.28
do they do what to make them not scared or test their fear yeah how do you test their fear put them in

255
00:24:37.28 --> 00:24:42.96
scary situation put them in scary situations in training make them repel off the high tower

256
00:24:42.96 --> 00:24:49.20
make them send to airborne school hey airborne school I would say you know of course there's

257
00:24:49.20 --> 00:24:54.56
there's some level of some things that you need to learn in airborne school but you're basically

258
00:24:55.28 --> 00:24:59.04
I mean you can literally throw a sack of potatoes out of an airplane with a parachute on

259
00:24:59.04 --> 00:25:03.68
and it's gonna land up pretty much okay most of the time and that's what you do when you go to the

260
00:25:03.68 --> 00:25:10.08
school you learn the proper exit procedures when I went to airborne school it's a kaze here's

261
00:25:10.08 --> 00:25:13.04
the extra procedures here's how you land you're floating down you don't know much control over

262
00:25:13.04 --> 00:25:20.16
your parachute so there's not a lot to learn technically it's not like a major skill set I mean

263
00:25:20.16 --> 00:25:25.60
it's a really pretty this way it's a three week school right it's not like it's not it's not a long

264
00:25:25.60 --> 00:25:31.20
intensive school about learning how to pack parachute or even how to maneuver yourself to the

265
00:25:31.20 --> 00:25:36.16
air because there's only so much you can do so what is it that's important about airborne school

266
00:25:36.16 --> 00:25:40.16
what's important about about airborne school is you're gonna overcome the fear of jumping out of a

267
00:25:40.16 --> 00:25:46.80
damn airplane that's important that's why an airborne you go go talk to the 80 second airborne

268
00:25:46.80 --> 00:25:51.92
division of the 101st airborne division those guys are awesome and they have that little thing that they've

269
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:58.48
all done that has put them they've been screened out a little bit because some people are going to

270
00:25:58.48 --> 00:26:03.44
be afraid so yes that's what you do you make people do hard scary things I mean in the

271
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:06.24
Seal teams it's the same thing what do they do you're gonna learn how to parachute then you're

272
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:09.76
gonna parachute at night then you're gonna parachute at night into the water then you're gonna

273
00:26:09.76 --> 00:26:16.16
jump out of a helicopter at night at you know 20 feet into the darkness and with a boat and you're

274
00:26:16.16 --> 00:26:20.000
gonna rig that thing up and you're gonna dive at night and you're gonna swim at night in the

275
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.64
open ocean like you're always just gonna go that scares some people some reason never really scared me

276
00:26:25.68 --> 00:26:33.60
I have no fear of sharks let me rephrase that I have no fear that a shark is randomly

277
00:26:33.60 --> 00:26:38.48
gonna bite me like if I was in the water never sharks I'd be scared yes and I know that there's

278
00:26:38.48 --> 00:26:42.80
sharks in the water said that you guys should be scared but I don't know I feel lucky yeah I feel like

279
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:46.72
sharks don't really want to eat they very much they'd rather eat like someone like you

280
00:26:46.72 --> 00:26:52.56
well I guess if you're on a surfboard I guess that increases the chances from what I

281
00:26:52.56 --> 00:26:57.44
understand yeah yeah because you look like a seal like I like a sea animal seal so that's what

282
00:26:57.44 --> 00:27:02.80
you do you put people in situations where they're gonna be afraid you know and this is something that

283
00:27:02.80 --> 00:27:08.64
I think everyone should do if you have a job that's gonna cost stress you want to put people

284
00:27:08.64 --> 00:27:14.40
in stressful situations so that's how you test that fear and again you're not gonna be able

285
00:27:14.40 --> 00:27:20.16
to remove the fear from people what you want to figure out is can they overcome the fear that's

286
00:27:20.16 --> 00:27:25.92
what you want to figure out what else you say no that they're organized never making attempt

287
00:27:27.20 --> 00:27:33.68
unless you unless you see they hope for victory so you got to convince if you're telling

288
00:27:33.68 --> 00:27:38.64
you guys like hey we're probably gonna lose you don't say that you say look it's gonna be hard

289
00:27:38.64 --> 00:27:42.88
but there's a chance we could take this you know what I mean you got to get them in that attitude

290
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:46.80
not the attitude of like oh we're just gonna lose we're just gonna be out here for no reason yeah

291
00:27:47.60 --> 00:27:56.64
don't let that happen yeah number four it is better to conquer the enemy with famine than with iron

292
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.40
in the victory of which fortune may do more than valiantness that one's pretty self-explanatory

293
00:28:06.40 --> 00:28:11.60
it's better defeat the enemy by hunger than steel you know it's better to let them starve than

294
00:28:11.60 --> 00:28:18.88
have to go and fight them and then he says in such a victory the fortune like you're luck counts

295
00:28:18.88 --> 00:28:25.60
more than valiantness which is cool understandable this is one of those things where

296
00:28:26.96 --> 00:28:31.44
he heard me say before the best victories are the victories where the person doesn't even know

297
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:36.56
that you're fighting them that's the best victory and then if you can if you can maintain your ego

298
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:41.60
after you win and you don't glow didn't ever even they ever register it yeah right they didn't know

299
00:28:41.60 --> 00:28:47.12
there enough they didn't know there enough that's what you want this is very similar but this this

300
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:52.80
part all throw a little back at it in such fortune victory counts more than valiantness

301
00:28:54.72 --> 00:28:57.60
yeah good fortune's gonna help but guess what we're gonna make our own luck

302
00:28:58.96 --> 00:29:03.28
right we're gonna make our own luck that's what we're gonna do we're gonna and we're gonna make

303
00:29:03.28 --> 00:29:08.32
bad luck for the enemy we're gonna dry up rivers we're gonna damn rivers so they can't grow food

304
00:29:09.04 --> 00:29:16.000
that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna cut off supply chains that's what we're gonna do

305
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.16
we're gonna make a we're gonna make fortune favor us number five no purpose is better than that

306
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:33.60
which is hidden from the enemy until you've executed it boom pretty straightforward no plan is

307
00:29:33.60 --> 00:29:39.68
better than that which you have concealed from the enemy until the time you execute it it's no doubt

308
00:29:42.96 --> 00:29:48.72
true in life true in business true in jiu jitsu that's what just essentially the element of

309
00:29:48.72 --> 00:29:53.28
supply of the surprise if you if you if you if your enemy doesn't know what you're gonna do

310
00:29:53.28 --> 00:29:57.60
yeah and then you're done and they go oh that was a nice arm walk yeah or wow you really took

311
00:29:57.60 --> 00:30:01.36
over that market share and I didn't see it coming yeah yeah if you don't see it coming that's

312
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:06.32
really it yeah they see it coming from a mile away it's like yeah you can still do that sometimes

313
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:12.32
deemed does that yeah but we yeah we talked about that but he does different things though like yeah

314
00:30:12.32 --> 00:30:17.92
yeah yeah he he like many many steps yeah yeah he'll tie up your defenses while it's on

315
00:30:17.92 --> 00:30:23.60
that when you when you see the incoming he ties up all your defenses like as if he gets close

316
00:30:26.16 --> 00:30:35.28
number six to know in the war how to understand occasion and to take it help if more than any

317
00:30:35.28 --> 00:30:42.40
other thing to know and war how to understand occasion and take it help if more than any other thing

318
00:30:42.40 --> 00:30:49.92
what does that mean that means you one of the best skills you can have is knowing how to recognize

319
00:30:49.92 --> 00:30:57.44
a good opportunity in war or in life and take advantage of that opportunity that is more beneficial

320
00:30:57.44 --> 00:31:02.72
than anything else and you know the biggest and most blatant example where you see this

321
00:31:03.36 --> 00:31:09.76
well your kids are not enough but with kids just kids kids have so much opportunity in life

322
00:31:09.76 --> 00:31:17.20
yeah and they just don't take and jump it like they should right yeah yeah I would that could

323
00:31:17.20 --> 00:31:22.72
see how that could be for sure but I think that's because they have hard time connecting now

324
00:31:22.72 --> 00:31:27.84
and then the future you know I guess that's the thing yeah there's no doubt that they have

325
00:31:28.64 --> 00:31:34.000
there's no doubt that they have that athletes real good athletes same thing they have all this

326
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.20
potential yeah anytime someone well not anytime oftentimes somebody that are some people

327
00:31:41.20 --> 00:31:46.88
that are given a gift yeah just given to them they don't have to work for it they don't want to take

328
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:50.56
advantage of it they don't see the opportunity they don't take advantage of the opportunity

329
00:31:50.56 --> 00:31:56.88
yeah that skill set is yeah yeah almost like you know when you give a kid a gift

330
00:31:56.88 --> 00:32:02.16
versus or money versus if they earn it you think you covered that away the way you're a kid

331
00:32:02.16 --> 00:32:06.96
yeah that's that's way covered away the way you're a kid yeah so when you earn it it's like you

332
00:32:06.96 --> 00:32:10.96
know the hard work sort of it takes and you kind of appreciate it and then whatever comes out of that

333
00:32:10.96 --> 00:32:16.88
but yeah if it's given to you you just you run the risk of squandering it for sure especially

334
00:32:16.88 --> 00:32:28.32
when the going kind of gets rough you know yeah no doubt next nature breed if few strong men

335
00:32:28.32 --> 00:32:39.60
the industry and the exercise make it many what does that mean that means you know nature makes

336
00:32:39.60 --> 00:32:49.84
very few strong brave men but hard work and training makes many boom it kind of work for it

337
00:32:50.96 --> 00:32:56.32
yeah you want people to be brave you want people to be have courage make them strong

338
00:32:56.32 --> 00:33:03.68
now make them work hard that will absolutely increase their bravery remember that question we

339
00:33:03.68 --> 00:33:09.36
got asked a while ago about how do I make my unit guys in military military how do I make them

340
00:33:10.24 --> 00:33:16.000
proud how I increase their level pride train hard they will get physically stronger they will get

341
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.88
mentally stronger and from that they will start to take pride in themselves and pride in themselves as a

342
00:33:22.88 --> 00:33:38.08
unit hey discipline may do more in war than fury figure need like yeah kind of like that one

343
00:33:38.08 --> 00:33:43.68
discipline counts more than fury in war discipline counts more than fury in life

344
00:33:43.68 --> 00:33:51.92
I'm not discounting emotions I'm not doing that because you can't because sometimes man

345
00:33:53.04 --> 00:33:57.76
people's emotions they get they will carry them through a really tough time period that's why

346
00:33:57.76 --> 00:34:00.96
in discipline it was freedom in the field manual I talk about how you got to use both

347
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:06.000
it's logic and you got to use emotions and when sometimes when emotionally it doesn't make any

348
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.36
sense or you're going to break emotionally you got to go with the logic of the situation like

349
00:34:09.36 --> 00:34:13.84
I got I got to drive through this and vice versa sometimes the logic is like this is makes no sense

350
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:21.04
whatsoever and it turns to the emotional side but discipline he says may do more and he's right

351
00:34:21.04 --> 00:34:24.72
it's not 100% it's like discipline because if you have people that are just discipline but they have no

352
00:34:24.72 --> 00:34:30.64
heart they have no emotion well how good are they they're not that good they're not they're not

353
00:34:30.64 --> 00:34:35.20
not as good as the person that has both there's not as good as the person that has discipline and a

354
00:34:35.20 --> 00:34:41.76
little bit of fury they can kind of get crazy when they need to but in MMA you see this you'll see

355
00:34:41.76 --> 00:34:46.56
someone when they're young and they'll lose some fights because they'll they'll sit someone down

356
00:34:46.56 --> 00:34:49.84
or whatever and then they'll just go crazy trying to catch them and they'll get caught in a triangle

357
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:58.72
mm you have to maintain your discipline even during the the actual battle you have to

358
00:34:58.72 --> 00:35:03.44
maintain your discipline you can't let the fury get a hold of you yeah too much

359
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:08.24
this is a plundered fury discipline fury yeah you know you watch the cyborg fight right

360
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:13.12
the reason why I'm sure a man didn't do this yes so this is what it seemed like it's fast

361
00:35:13.12 --> 00:35:18.88
but this is what it's looked like where cyborg landed like a solid one and a man in Nunes

362
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.76
as a response unleashed fury like some legit fury fury but it was discipline fury because when

363
00:35:27.76 --> 00:35:33.20
she started landing hard once she didn't like over commit it was like really balanced you know she

364
00:35:33.20 --> 00:35:38.08
looked great but there was some there was a lot of fury so there's a fury like it wasn't like

365
00:35:38.08 --> 00:35:43.60
all just oh my god you laid it like punch it there was there was fury but Tim Kennedy someone's like

366
00:35:43.60 --> 00:35:52.72
uh the UFC tweeted out like she's throwing haymakers and Tim Kennedy's like those aren't haymakers

367
00:35:52.72 --> 00:35:59.76
because every single one of them hit they were full punches from Amanda that were nailing cyborg

368
00:35:59.76 --> 00:36:05.36
right in the head yeah in most of the time like five times in a row you don't you don't normally

369
00:36:05.36 --> 00:36:13.84
see five punches land especially not punches that are thrown with that much fury yes yeah

370
00:36:13.84 --> 00:36:19.60
you can kind of tell when like you see like they're they're uh feet when they're you know third

371
00:36:19.60 --> 00:36:24.16
punch is like you could there's like a huge forward lean if they're haymakers there's like the

372
00:36:24.16 --> 00:36:29.60
huge forward lean and they usually pressing forward like fully but when they're like discipline

373
00:36:29.60 --> 00:36:33.60
there's like that you see you can see the balance like they'll back up just a little bit you know

374
00:36:33.60 --> 00:36:43.36
yeah it's good so good yeah so that's crazy discipline may do more than fury so you know what

375
00:36:43.36 --> 00:36:49.28
make sure you have some discipline in the life alright next one number nine when any apart from the

376
00:36:49.28 --> 00:36:58.000
enemy side for to come to serve the when they be faithful they shall be unto the always great

377
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.72
gains for that power of the adversaries are more diminished with the loss of them that run away

378
00:37:04.72 --> 00:37:12.08
then though of then those that be slain although that the name of a fugitive be to new friends

379
00:37:12.08 --> 00:37:19.44
suspected and old to odious to old odious so what is he talking about traders there three

380
00:37:19.44 --> 00:37:23.76
talk about so he said when any apart from the enemy side to come serve you so when when people

381
00:37:24.56 --> 00:37:29.20
leave the enemy and they come to serve with you they're gonna be more loyal

382
00:37:31.12 --> 00:37:39.36
and they're great they're a great acquisition and actually he's saying that people that leave

383
00:37:39.36 --> 00:37:44.24
the enemy and come to your side are more powerful for you than people that you've killed

384
00:37:46.32 --> 00:37:54.96
and they have more value the when they come aboard your team they're gonna be suspected you

385
00:37:54.96 --> 00:38:01.44
know the the old the your team is gonna look at him with like a cautious eye and the team that they

386
00:38:01.44 --> 00:38:07.36
left are gonna hate them yeah they're gonna hate them that was weird when social nitson was saying

387
00:38:07.36 --> 00:38:14.48
that when they would capture the Russian turn coat soldiers that were now fighting for the Nazis

388
00:38:15.28 --> 00:38:21.60
as soon as they spoke any Russian did kill him that was that was a pretty scary thought so this is

389
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:26.16
very accurate from that perspective yeah if you're a trader we're not even gonna give you a chance

390
00:38:26.16 --> 00:38:33.92
we're just gonna kill you yeah wait so who wait who'd so the Russians the Russians didn't kill him

391
00:38:33.92 --> 00:38:42.24
that no so there was a whole group of Russian soldiers that turned against Stalin and turned

392
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:48.72
against Russia and started fighting for the Nazis yeah and so when the Russians would capture

393
00:38:48.72 --> 00:38:54.64
those what they considered to be traders as soon as they heard a soldier speaking Russian they'd

394
00:38:54.64 --> 00:39:01.52
kill him but not these you mean they were they were Russian soldiers fighting for the Nazis

395
00:39:01.52 --> 00:39:08.48
was it vossal what was the guy's name so there was a German or sorry a Russian general that

396
00:39:08.48 --> 00:39:13.60
was the leader of that whole group the vossal army I think was the name yeah and so

397
00:39:15.28 --> 00:39:22.64
when the Russian Stalin's Russian actual red soldiers would capture these traders that were fighting

398
00:39:22.64 --> 00:39:30.08
against them now they would if they heard them speaking Russian did kill him so this is from that

399
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:37.28
perspective it's accurate yeah I wonder why they're more valuable you think because what because

400
00:39:37.28 --> 00:39:44.08
or loyal you said loyal right to well the the the Russian soldiers that were now fighting for the

401
00:39:44.08 --> 00:39:48.32
Nazis they would fight to the death because they knew that they were dead anyways they were captured

402
00:39:48.32 --> 00:39:54.80
yeah like if they got yeah so yeah they were they would fight even harder the thing that I'm not sure

403
00:39:54.80 --> 00:40:01.60
about this is well I I guess I agree with it I do agree with it when someone's a trader you're

404
00:40:01.60 --> 00:40:07.20
suspect of them right yes you know you're just you're just like you're you get your a trader I'm

405
00:40:07.20 --> 00:40:12.96
suspect to you so it's gonna take a little time for me to actually trust that you really came to

406
00:40:12.96 --> 00:40:17.44
my side yeah but I guess like when you think about just like how you said you know they know

407
00:40:17.44 --> 00:40:21.92
they're dead anyway kind of thing where it's like okay let's say mean you were enemies whatever and

408
00:40:21.92 --> 00:40:27.84
one of my guys goes to you and says hey I give up all all help you I give up you're like okay he

409
00:40:27.84 --> 00:40:32.96
gives up I get it and let's see what he has to offer kind of thing yeah but you're suspect yeah but

410
00:40:32.96 --> 00:40:40.000
you're suspect but let's say a guy in your team used to be on my team and I know that I'm pissed at

411
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.32
that guy yeah and then he gives up now to me to my guys like my guy CM or whatever and he's like

412
00:40:46.32 --> 00:40:51.60
okay I give up I'll help you oh no no you don't give up you're dead yeah so it's like that like how

413
00:40:51.60 --> 00:40:57.52
you say no they're dead anyway what the Russians did to the vossal soldiers yeah so you

414
00:40:57.52 --> 00:41:02.48
you traded okay cool you're dead and that makes sense right so that's probably why they have

415
00:41:02.48 --> 00:41:06.96
to be loyal because it's either loyal to your death you know they can't give up anymore if I

416
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:12.96
am not a trader I can give up and give me POWB whatever I can I can give up I had that option

417
00:41:12.96 --> 00:41:17.60
trader who already made the trade he doesn't have that option that's why he's loyal he has to be

418
00:41:17.60 --> 00:41:22.000
like yeah the men who he's gonna fight to the death yeah and it's interesting too that

419
00:41:22.72 --> 00:41:28.48
traders are you know in the business world because in the business world you know there's

420
00:41:28.48 --> 00:41:35.28
everyone's always recruiting there's limited number of the human capital limits in in the world

421
00:41:35.28 --> 00:41:42.000
and we can only get so many people that can do this job and if you have skills in that job you're

422
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.16
getting recruited all the time and so that's that hurts when they leave and that's why and

423
00:41:50.16 --> 00:41:56.48
and just to kind of close the loop on this when they leave almost all the time the reason that

424
00:41:56.48 --> 00:42:01.20
they're leaving is because of leadership well I should say lack of leadership inside the

425
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:07.84
organization so if you have a if you have a problem hanging on to people in your organization

426
00:42:07.84 --> 00:42:16.40
it's most likely a leadership problem not a comp problem not a midlife crisis problem for the

427
00:42:16.40 --> 00:42:21.92
employee it's a leadership problem because good good people will stay with good leaders and if

428
00:42:21.92 --> 00:42:25.92
there's not good leaders they're looking for another job they're looking for another way they're looking

429
00:42:25.92 --> 00:42:39.92
for another opportunity leadership leadership leadership gets on number ten better it is in

430
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:46.96
pitching the field to reserve behind the first front aid enough then to make the front bigger to

431
00:42:46.96 --> 00:42:58.88
disperse the soldiers what that saying is it's better to keep your reserves just behind the

432
00:42:58.88 --> 00:43:06.24
keep some reserves just behind the front lines rather than spread out your reserves and take on a

433
00:43:06.24 --> 00:43:12.48
bigger front trying hold more areas better to you know this is prioritize next keep your keep your

434
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:18.48
focus of effort even with your reserves keep folks of effort keep them consolidated so you can

435
00:43:18.48 --> 00:43:29.36
utilize them well next up number eleven he is difficulty overcome which can know his own

436
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:40.40
power and the same of the enemy okay let's that was almost like a Yoda type sure he is

437
00:43:40.40 --> 00:43:47.36
difficulty overcome so what we're saying there is it's hard to overcome someone who knows how to

438
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:52.88
recognize or knows and understands his own power and the power of the enemy so what does that mean

439
00:43:52.88 --> 00:43:59.20
know your strengths and weaknesses that's what it means yes since he says that right yes something about

440
00:43:59.20 --> 00:44:09.44
yes definitely number twelve the valiantness of the soldiers availeth more than the multitude

441
00:44:10.72 --> 00:44:17.68
sometimes the situation help with more than the valiantness okay so what we're talking about there is

442
00:44:17.68 --> 00:44:24.64
that the bravery of the soldiers is worth more than the number of soldiers you have make sense if you have

443
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:33.44
brave courageous soldiers they can take a lot more and they can do a lot more than people

444
00:44:33.44 --> 00:44:41.68
or soldiers that are afraid so you want brave soldiers and then it says the site what does it say

445
00:44:41.68 --> 00:44:46.64
that sometimes the situation help with more than the valiantness so even that what trump's the

446
00:44:46.64 --> 00:44:51.92
courageous of what trump's the bravery is what's the what's the terrain situation you know what's

447
00:44:51.92 --> 00:44:59.20
the environment that you're in what are the rules of the game what are the rules the game that

448
00:44:59.20 --> 00:45:05.12
you're playing because if you if you know the rules you're going to be in a much better situation

449
00:45:06.64 --> 00:45:12.64
the this happens in jjitsu right yes because rules are always a little bit different there's no unified

450
00:45:12.64 --> 00:45:18.88
set rules in jjitsu there's some close but there's no unified set rules and sometimes someone will

451
00:45:18.88 --> 00:45:22.40
lose simply because they don't know the rules yeah and then once you know the rules you got to

452
00:45:22.40 --> 00:45:28.80
train to the rules yes like ebi yes ebi you have those positions that you start of in if you're

453
00:45:28.80 --> 00:45:33.36
an overtime you start in spiderweb you start on the back right if you don't if you don't if you want

454
00:45:33.36 --> 00:45:37.36
you know those rules then you got to practice those positions so you can finish the remarks

455
00:45:37.36 --> 00:45:41.12
so you can finish from the back or if you can escape from either one of those two yeah if you don't

456
00:45:41.12 --> 00:45:48.80
know that and you don't practice it because like for instance I'm pretty good at things

457
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:56.88
finishing on arm lock pretty good at finishing an arm lock sure on the back I normally

458
00:45:56.88 --> 00:46:03.44
transition from the back to another position so I would if I was going to an ebi tournament I'd

459
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:09.44
have to go and focus on what that rule set is and make sure I know how to win from that position yeah

460
00:46:09.44 --> 00:46:17.20
yeah big one is the submission only versus points and so people like let's say they spend 10 years

461
00:46:17.20 --> 00:46:23.28
competing with points in the tournaments you know then they go to submission only with the guy who's

462
00:46:23.28 --> 00:46:28.64
only trains in submission only he's gonna out you know it's gonna have an advantage yeah

463
00:46:28.64 --> 00:46:32.80
in all these different yeah different ways because certain rules don't apply some do

464
00:46:34.24 --> 00:46:42.40
yeah and the terrain part man this is this is it took me a while to understand this in my

465
00:46:42.40 --> 00:46:50.08
navy career how important terrain is and now it's so obvious but when you're maneuvering on the

466
00:46:50.08 --> 00:46:54.72
battlefield if you know how to read terrain well you have a complete advantage over the enemy

467
00:46:54.72 --> 00:47:00.24
complete advantage over the enemy you should be paying attention to that terrain studying maps

468
00:47:00.24 --> 00:47:06.32
looking at it now they have all these you can you can simulate the earth right it's a Google

469
00:47:06.32 --> 00:47:11.92
maps like a high speed we can get down at i level and you can walk the terrain and really understand

470
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:16.24
what the visibility is like that's the kind of that's that's you should you gotta take advantage

471
00:47:16.24 --> 00:47:20.80
of those tools you got to understand the terrain you got to understand the terrain that you're

472
00:47:20.80 --> 00:47:26.80
going into in the business world you go gotta go into a company understanding what the situation is

473
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:31.52
there when you get hired into a new company you want to know the terrain you want to know who's

474
00:47:31.52 --> 00:47:37.68
got the clouds you know you want to know who the movers and shakers are you want to know what

475
00:47:37.68 --> 00:47:45.28
things are off limits in whatever you don't know who's buying like you know people they

476
00:47:45.28 --> 00:47:50.48
you know people we say this was a billion dollar industry right like that kind of stuff like

477
00:47:50.48 --> 00:47:56.16
oh is it you know how's the what's the need for your product i'm remembering because they want

478
00:47:56.16 --> 00:48:01.20
shark tank this is what they always ask what what was the what was this a particular product

479
00:48:01.20 --> 00:48:05.92
it's not an average everyone like pretty much that's one of the things like they ask or they say

480
00:48:05.92 --> 00:48:11.36
they'll be like oh yeah this is like a million how you know a million people own pets you know

481
00:48:11.36 --> 00:48:16.32
and all these pets need this you know so you see seems like so they kind of they got another terrain

482
00:48:16.32 --> 00:48:21.60
in that way yeah that's true there's data know how many people have pets then they don't know how many

483
00:48:21.60 --> 00:48:27.20
people gonna buy that shampoo you know so you gotta know that one do shark tank wait

484
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:30.96
maybe we should just do a leadership show about shark tank what people learn from shark tank

485
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:44.48
sure next up number 13 new and sudden thing make armies afraid slow and accustomed things

486
00:48:44.48 --> 00:48:52.48
be little regarded of them therefore make the army practice and to know with small fights

487
00:48:52.48 --> 00:49:01.84
a new enemy before they'll come to fight the field with him middle English coming at you

488
00:49:01.84 --> 00:49:09.20
so what what is that what basically what we're saying here's number one new and surprising

489
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:19.28
things frightened armies the new and surprising things frightened people so on the opposing to that

490
00:49:19.28 --> 00:49:27.04
customary and expected things they can handle so what do you do how do you how do you how do you

491
00:49:27.04 --> 00:49:35.68
you properly mitigate that therefore you practice and you fight small engagements to get them

492
00:49:35.68 --> 00:49:42.64
experienced before you go to battle on the big battlefield with them with the enemy that's what you

493
00:49:42.64 --> 00:49:49.60
do train hard don't dive right in get them used to the new technology that's what you do

494
00:49:51.28 --> 00:49:56.56
this is another good one with kids right you'll throw your kid into this scenario that they

495
00:49:56.56 --> 00:50:01.28
haven't been into before you give them a little taste of it well yeah this is this is exposure

496
00:50:01.28 --> 00:50:06.08
therapy once again I get asked on the warrior kid podcast I get asked every

497
00:50:06.08 --> 00:50:13.36
like every day I get at least one question from a kid that's I'm afraid of what do I do

498
00:50:14.40 --> 00:50:20.000
and I I I usually wait two or three podcasts before I answer the same question again because

499
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.28
it's kids they got to get the repetition they got to get the reps in but it's exposure therapy

500
00:50:25.28 --> 00:50:29.04
you're afraid of something cool do a little bit of it then do a little bit more and that's

501
00:50:29.04 --> 00:50:34.32
unknowingly what I did in the way the warrior kid won with him overcoming his fear of the

502
00:50:34.32 --> 00:50:38.72
water I didn't know that that was a real thing not until Jordan Peterson's like this is called

503
00:50:38.72 --> 00:50:43.52
exposure therapy yeah I guess I need to talk like Kermit from to imitate Jordan but

504
00:50:44.40 --> 00:50:53.20
but he's like yeah that's exposure therapy yeah okay next number 13 number one I

505
00:50:53.20 --> 00:51:02.000
went on the number 14 he that with disorder follow with the enemy after that he is broken

506
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:12.40
will do no other than to become of a conqueror a loser if you pursue a routed enemy in a

507
00:51:12.40 --> 00:51:18.24
disorganized manner victory will be lost and you'll become a loser keep it under control

508
00:51:18.24 --> 00:51:25.04
all the Amanda newness right sure she had the victory and the you ever seen that that one real

509
00:51:25.04 --> 00:51:31.52
quick clip and I forget who the fighter is that did it is UFC the guy takes a body shot

510
00:51:31.52 --> 00:51:36.88
any he kills over like he's about to like go down and the dude comes running in swinging

511
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:43.44
the dude that's killed over like he's hurt just fuck yeah he wasn't hurt he was just faking it

512
00:51:43.44 --> 00:51:49.92
yeah I think he was hurt talk about Scott yeah yeah maybe he was hurt but he wasn't hurt as bad as he

513
00:51:49.92 --> 00:51:55.36
right he's functional apparently he's much more like the dude out yeah it was the lesson

514
00:51:55.36 --> 00:52:00.56
his nickname is drog going on that it's interesting that that stuff doesn't happen more often

515
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:06.48
it's like a trick football plays yeah how come more trick football plays don't happen

516
00:52:06.48 --> 00:52:11.44
because they'd lose their trickery element of it and I'll sometimes there's a lot of risk involved

517
00:52:11.44 --> 00:52:17.12
there's more risk than like a traditional play a lot of times yeah yeah and it's like like the

518
00:52:17.12 --> 00:52:22.24
rope a don't remember that the rope a dope oh yeah yeah you essentially like act like you're

519
00:52:22.24 --> 00:52:27.52
kind of hurt or tired of whatever and then they punched them so far then you get them but yeah yeah

520
00:52:27.52 --> 00:52:34.88
yeah you gotta be careful on that kind of stuff so when you do have your enemy

521
00:52:36.72 --> 00:52:43.68
on the run don't go after them crazy keep it under control yeah there's a play in football

522
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:48.48
called the reverse right and I thought that because you just said why don't they run

523
00:52:48.48 --> 00:52:52.96
trickery you know I didn't play football yeah and when you see the trick plays

524
00:52:52.96 --> 00:52:58.48
then you think well that seemed to work pretty good why don't they do that stuff more often yeah

525
00:52:58.48 --> 00:53:04.000
okay so here's a common trick play right they the quarterback does a so sweep right

526
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.08
to the to the running back there runs the outside and then the running back oh he stops

527
00:53:10.08 --> 00:53:14.72
before he reaches line of skirmitch he stops and he throws the football not to a receiver but to

528
00:53:14.72 --> 00:53:19.12
the quarterback who ran a route on the other side of the field and because no it's going to

529
00:53:19.12 --> 00:53:23.12
come to the quarterback he's not a receiver you know and that was why it opened the past always

530
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:30.16
why it opened what's it called we called it passed back to the quarterback so good like

531
00:53:30.16 --> 00:53:34.80
three sweet pass back to the quarterback but I can see where there's risk in that one yes because

532
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:39.84
that's a running back so you gotta nail that throw which is really hard for running back

533
00:53:39.84 --> 00:53:46.48
typically but I'd say the the one that would always work is in pop Warner anyway it would always

534
00:53:46.48 --> 00:53:51.20
work is the reverse it's essentially like you do a sweet everyone's running this way to block

535
00:53:51.20 --> 00:53:55.68
for this running back everyone except for the one tight-end or the whiter's coming this way and

536
00:53:55.68 --> 00:54:00.16
the running back hands it off the him going this way so he's full speed running this way so everyone

537
00:54:00.16 --> 00:54:06.32
has to change direction to chase them and usually that side of fields wide open it works way

538
00:54:06.32 --> 00:54:11.76
better in pop Warner and younger teams because they don't like these these situations like

539
00:54:11.76 --> 00:54:14.72
they don't know they just see everyone running there and they just sort of go you know more

540
00:54:14.72 --> 00:54:20.08
than a professional they're gonna be like wait I shouldn't have just been you know but that was

541
00:54:20.08 --> 00:54:24.32
one I was like why don't we just always run the reverse because every time this is this team

542
00:54:24.32 --> 00:54:29.04
that we play it against they'd always run it and it always I understand why if you ran it every time

543
00:54:29.04 --> 00:54:35.52
well then then the regular reverse or the regular play would become the surprise but it seems like

544
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:39.92
it seems like you could keep people guessing a little bit more those trick plays always see

545
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:44.40
I always look at him how it's pretty creative and pretty good yeah yeah I

546
00:54:44.40 --> 00:54:51.12
think you see it like kind of like I said like when you go up in like skill like you're going to

547
00:54:51.12 --> 00:54:56.32
the pros or whatever trick plays don't work is good they have to be really advanced trick plays that's

548
00:54:56.32 --> 00:55:02.48
when you have you've seen like the trick play that like where they like almost walk off the field

549
00:55:02.48 --> 00:55:06.88
yeah and then they like walk over like there's something wrong with the ball or something like

550
00:55:06.88 --> 00:55:12.08
stand up and they'll be like no so they're wrong and then they just start running yeah so even that

551
00:55:12.08 --> 00:55:17.76
and then those can backfire too because they'll be like if all it takes is one defensive person

552
00:55:17.76 --> 00:55:21.84
to know that hey that ball is in play right now so they can just sort of walk over and hit it

553
00:55:21.84 --> 00:55:25.76
out of the hand grab it from whatever they want because no one's blocking them you know no one's like

554
00:55:25.76 --> 00:55:30.56
even it's kind of it's just risky check you get more people doing that they're going to be like oh

555
00:55:30.56 --> 00:55:38.64
they're hip to it and it wouldn't ever work yeah after a while number 15 he the prepare if not

556
00:55:38.64 --> 00:55:48.48
necessary visuals to live upon is overcome without iron so um whoever does not prepare food

557
00:55:48.48 --> 00:55:53.92
and provisions necessary to live is going to be overcome without any weapons at all so what does that

558
00:55:53.92 --> 00:55:59.36
mean take care of your people take care make sure you take care of your logistics logistics wins wars

559
00:55:59.36 --> 00:56:09.44
and people need to survive so do that number 16 he that trust if more in horsemen than in footmen

560
00:56:09.44 --> 00:56:15.76
or more in footmen than in horsemen must accommodate himself with the situation so in the ancient

561
00:56:15.76 --> 00:56:21.44
times you had cavalry on horses and you had the infantrymen on feet and he said if you prefer one over

562
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:33.60
the other then you have to put yourself in the right situation where it's advantageous so that that's

563
00:56:33.60 --> 00:56:38.96
why it's good to be well balanced and not really prefer one over the other but if you do then put

564
00:56:38.96 --> 00:56:44.96
yourself in a situation that's most advantageous to your style or preference of fighting

565
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:52.56
like but make sure you learn how to wrestle because if you don't know how to wrestle someone

566
00:56:52.56 --> 00:57:04.72
else is going to dictate you where that fight's going to go 17 when Valrite see if in the day

567
00:57:04.72 --> 00:57:17.12
there be coming any spy into the camp cause every man to go into his lodge okay so woo what we're

568
00:57:17.12 --> 00:57:21.28
saying is this pretty straightforward basic head count if you want to see if there's a spy in the camp

569
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:28.16
every time everyone to their place you know get ahead count no we deal 18 change purpose when

570
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:35.36
Val perceives that the enemy half for seen it was that mean if you if you think the enemy or if you

571
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:39.68
perceive that the enemy knows what you're doing then change your plan that's that's what that means

572
00:57:39.68 --> 00:57:46.08
pretty straightforward now where we don't do that or the reason most of the time we don't do that is

573
00:57:46.08 --> 00:57:51.20
because of our ego we got our plan and we're going to stick to it now this is a total

574
00:57:51.20 --> 00:58:01.28
this is why leadership is hard because there's a point where you're plan you got your plan and

575
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:06.48
if you stick to your plan you can it's going to work right and then there's a point where you

576
00:58:06.48 --> 00:58:10.88
stick in your plan you're sticking with the plan and it's going to fail because it's not working

577
00:58:10.88 --> 00:58:15.84
so as a leader it's only the hardest thing to do is leaders to recognize like you know what

578
00:58:16.48 --> 00:58:20.08
the plan that I came up with it's not going to be perfect but it's still going to work and we're

579
00:58:20.08 --> 00:58:26.16
going to go with it because to try and change the plan halfway through is really hard to do even if

580
00:58:26.16 --> 00:58:29.92
you rehearse the contingencies and now if you rehearse the contingencies properly you're

581
00:58:29.92 --> 00:58:34.32
probably going to be able to execute your new plan pretty easily but if you didn't it's going to be a

582
00:58:34.32 --> 00:58:38.88
problem so this is one of the hardest things for a leader to do is to pay enough attention and then

583
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:44.16
way the risk versus reward because if you're coming up with if you have your plan and you're

584
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:48.000
executing the plan and I'll put some changes it's not quite what you thought you decide you're going

585
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.08
to try and do something completely different what your change is that you make on the flyer

586
00:58:52.08 --> 00:58:55.84
going to cause as much confusion as what the enemy is doing and it's going to be a real problem

587
00:58:56.80 --> 00:59:03.92
however like this says if the enemy sees what you're doing and now the reacting to it in a proper way

588
00:59:03.92 --> 00:59:08.16
and your plan is no longer effective you have to be able to you have to be able to

589
00:59:08.96 --> 00:59:14.80
comprehend that and discern whether you should change or not and that's one of the hardest things for

590
00:59:14.80 --> 00:59:20.64
the hardest decisions for a leader to make as it's happening. What's worse than that is we have

591
00:59:20.64 --> 00:59:25.68
a long period of time when you start talking about strategic plans this is where ego gets more involved

592
00:59:25.68 --> 00:59:32.08
because when I have this plan and this is what we're going to do and I'm just going to stick with it

593
00:59:32.08 --> 00:59:38.32
and if it's not working I'm going to do it harder. So that's what you want to watch out for

594
00:59:38.32 --> 00:59:46.08
you know there's some of these companies being taken down by online companies right you

595
00:59:46.08 --> 00:59:50.40
gotta change your game plan you know you gotta adjust you gotta look at them and say okay what

596
00:59:50.40 --> 00:59:56.08
are they doing where are they going we don't blockbuster like I like I've said this before blockbuster

597
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.76
could have could have completely dominated Netflix but what did they do no we're just over here

598
01:00:01.76 --> 01:00:05.60
hey people are going to keep coming to our stores yeah you know there's a certain feeling that

599
01:00:05.60 --> 01:00:08.96
you get when you come into a store and you get to look at them browse with the movies it's

600
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:12.56
something like you get to pick up popcorn we're going to get popcorn at your house you know people

601
01:00:12.56 --> 01:00:17.84
going to want to come into these stores no actually they're not they already have popcorn if

602
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:24.72
their house Amazon delivered it yesterday in an hour by the way you're turning to an island and yet

603
01:00:24.72 --> 01:00:30.08
they had all the relationships with the movie places with the one of those movie companies called

604
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:34.96
what are the production companies what's more than brothers what is that yeah production studio

605
01:00:34.96 --> 01:00:38.24
yeah they all that studio they got the relationships with the studio they could have been like

606
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:43.12
hey we're going to start selling this stuff online yeah and they were saying well that doesn't

607
01:00:43.12 --> 01:00:47.12
make any sense because that it's going to be all jumbled up when it gets download again but it's

608
01:00:47.12 --> 01:00:51.12
going to get better we're just playing the long game yeah it's weird that blockbuster said they were

609
01:00:51.12 --> 01:00:56.08
thinking you know it's too hard to download a movie on the internet it's going to be jumbled up

610
01:00:56.08 --> 01:01:00.40
there's going to be buffering no one even knew what bothered Netflix invented buffering no

611
01:01:00.40 --> 01:01:06.88
buffering is just the internet situation yeah when it has to catch up with you remember jiffy five

612
01:01:06.88 --> 01:01:12.40
years ago there was buffering on all kinds of stuff but now there's hardly any buffering barely any

613
01:01:12.40 --> 01:01:16.80
buffering I bet my littleist daughter doesn't even know what buffering is she's there just streaming

614
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.32
I'm sure she knows what it is but she has never witnessed it yeah well then again you know

615
01:01:22.32 --> 01:01:27.52
you bad service somewhere you get some buffering they weren't wrong they I mean they were wrong

616
01:01:27.52 --> 01:01:33.28
block blockbuster but they just the whole idea of like people like coming into blockbuster and

617
01:01:33.28 --> 01:01:37.52
browsing the movies and buying the thing is that's true like we did like doing that yeah but it's

618
01:01:37.52 --> 01:01:42.16
because we didn't have a better option you know like when you go like even going to the store

619
01:01:42.16 --> 01:01:47.20
sometimes it's kind of cool and fun you know sometimes but most of the time at the end of the

620
01:01:47.20 --> 01:01:52.72
day I'd rather press a button than go to the store I'd rather press a button too every single time

621
01:01:52.72 --> 01:01:58.96
yeah and there's also that thing where you you're it's a positive feedback loop right it's an echo

622
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:04.72
chamber I like going to you know to those people in the in the sea suite of blockbuster like

623
01:02:04.72 --> 01:02:09.20
you know my wife loves going down and picking out a movie with the kids they love doing that you know

624
01:02:09.20 --> 01:02:12.96
there's someone's like yeah you know my kids love that too so I mean my teenage daughter likes

625
01:02:12.96 --> 01:02:16.56
doing it too with her friends and like you said this because there's no other option yeah your teenage

626
01:02:16.56 --> 01:02:20.48
daughter would be rather being a road alone and a room clicking on the next Netflix movie

627
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:29.36
yep pop in there pop corn that got delivered or yeah so if you if you are on a strategy it's not

628
01:02:29.36 --> 01:02:34.56
working you got to recognize that you need to change it note to self everyone in the leadership

629
01:02:34.56 --> 01:02:41.84
position pay attention to that one next up number 20 soldiers when they abide at home are maintained

630
01:02:41.84 --> 01:02:48.08
with fear and punishment after when they are led to the war with hope and with reward

631
01:02:48.08 --> 01:02:54.40
that what's insane is so when soldiers are confined to their quarters they're kept there by

632
01:02:54.40 --> 01:03:01.12
fear and punishment when they're led to war they're led by hope and reward you know fear for me

633
01:03:01.12 --> 01:03:08.88
is just not a good tool for a leader to use period I'm not saying you never this is I'm not saying

634
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:14.08
you should never use it right you there should be some element a little element of fear right

635
01:03:14.08 --> 01:03:21.20
let me ask you this to your kids have any fear of you at all because you seem real nice

636
01:03:21.20 --> 01:03:29.36
yeah they do yeah there's there's no healthy element yeah I mean I would say yeah healthy but

637
01:03:29.36 --> 01:03:35.36
I don't really know what the standard of healthy fear levels are but yeah we agree that there

638
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:40.80
is a healthy level of fear even with your kids yes your kids shouldn't just think that

639
01:03:40.80 --> 01:03:46.32
there's it's going to be no repercussions for anything that they do yeah your troops should also

640
01:03:46.32 --> 01:03:52.48
feel a healthy level of fear yeah and it's hard even use that word because they were

641
01:03:52.48 --> 01:03:58.72
to so negative yeah but there should at least be a level of like you know what we want to do that

642
01:03:58.72 --> 01:04:04.72
yeah no there's a line with jocco and you don't want to cross it there's a line with dad echo

643
01:04:04.72 --> 01:04:12.16
you see he's real nice and all cruiser I think I am a little bit too crazy though

644
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:22.000
so sometimes you do have to make sure people understand that if they cross the line there's

645
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.20
going to be a problem and my kids definitely understand if they cross the line there's going to be a problem

646
01:04:25.20 --> 01:04:30.32
yeah that makes yeah to real problems it doesn't surprise any keep some in check

647
01:04:30.32 --> 01:04:37.28
next up 20 and I'm pretty lenient I'm pretty cruiser you're actually surprisingly cruiser

648
01:04:37.28 --> 01:04:43.60
in lenient everyone thinks it would be the great Santini you probably never seen that movie

649
01:04:44.88 --> 01:04:50.40
but you don't want to raise your kids like that well you don't want to be all militant and

650
01:04:50.40 --> 01:04:56.72
impose discipline on your kids and make them number one reliant on your discipline

651
01:04:56.72 --> 01:05:02.72
instead of their discipline I don't want to you don't want anyone like that you don't want

652
01:05:02.72 --> 01:05:06.24
your team to be like that whether reliant on you barking at them to tell them what to do

653
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:09.76
you don't want that then they can't function for themselves you don't want your kids to be that

654
01:05:09.76 --> 01:05:14.08
way either your kids to think you know what I need to make a good decision I could

655
01:05:14.08 --> 01:05:17.76
slack off or I could do what I'm supposed to do I'm gonna do it I'm supposed to do because I

656
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:20.72
know it's gonna be beneficial in the end as opposed to I'm gonna do it I'm supposed to do

657
01:05:20.72 --> 01:05:24.88
only because I'm afraid that my dad's gonna yell at me or ground me or take away my computer

658
01:05:24.88 --> 01:05:31.92
or smash one of my favorite toys yeah yeah you don't you I mean the assumption I think

659
01:05:31.92 --> 01:05:37.44
anyway would be that you're like more drill sergeant yeah I'm not even drill sergeant I'm never

660
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.76
I know you know but I think it's like when you look at you or maybe with you just said like

661
01:05:43.76 --> 01:05:50.48
one or two sound bites and you're like all he's just there's recordings many recordings of when I

662
01:05:50.48 --> 01:05:58.08
used to debrief seal potins okay I'm gonna try and get some of those and what is it they're just

663
01:05:58.08 --> 01:06:05.28
well it's it's definitely I could see it's not drill sergeant E but it's definitely direct and

664
01:06:05.28 --> 01:06:10.32
can be pretty harsh yeah that's what I understand people would probably but but that was usually

665
01:06:10.32 --> 01:06:14.56
it only be that way if somebody really did something a grieges because most of the time

666
01:06:14.56 --> 01:06:18.08
maybe okay what do you think what do you think about over here debrief me on the you know what I mean

667
01:06:18.08 --> 01:06:23.68
so yeah and it's all contextual too like you know I guess it's kind of natural like let's say I

668
01:06:23.68 --> 01:06:28.72
heard that or anything and I heard that and be like okay he's real direct and real strict and

669
01:06:28.72 --> 01:06:32.80
like all this stuff so it's just natural to be like oh cuz he's that kind of guy you know

670
01:06:32.80 --> 01:06:38.80
rather than kind of the understand the nuance like okay he's talking to these people at this time yeah

671
01:06:38.80 --> 01:06:44.16
and then versus but then again then that it opens it up who knows and how you'd be so you just

672
01:06:44.16 --> 01:06:50.40
mind just sort of wants to just attach yeah what they have witnessed you know to everything yeah well

673
01:06:50.40 --> 01:06:57.60
even drill instructors are like drill instructors yeah I mean it's a it's a training methodology

674
01:06:57.60 --> 01:07:02.24
yeah there's a purpose for them in that way see and you know that because you've been around

675
01:07:02.24 --> 01:07:07.44
because these type of leader isn't doesn't function that type of leader is not good

676
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:16.56
that type of person isn't gonna function within a team yeah so you can't you just can't be that

677
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:22.96
way is there a level of intensity sure do I bring a level of intensity sometimes yes absolutely

678
01:07:24.24 --> 01:07:30.32
but that's not the way to go through life imposing discipline and fear into your team

679
01:07:30.32 --> 01:07:36.80
you'll end up with either one of two things a broken team that relies on you for their discipline

680
01:07:37.76 --> 01:07:43.92
or a team that mutes against you and comes up and kills you frags you in the as they did in the

681
01:07:43.92 --> 01:07:56.96
nom next number 21 good captains comment never to fight the field except necessity can strain them

682
01:07:57.68 --> 01:08:07.52
and occasion call them so what that's saying is good you know good captains good leaders never

683
01:08:07.52 --> 01:08:13.84
enter into the engagement unless it's completely necessary that's a that's a great

684
01:08:13.84 --> 01:08:18.64
point and this is one of those things where if you're in a leadership position you shouldn't be doing

685
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:22.96
the you shouldn't be shooting your gun at the enemy you should be observing your team shooting

686
01:08:22.96 --> 01:08:27.84
the gun and looking to see where the enemy is maneuvering too yeah this is a this is about

687
01:08:27.84 --> 01:08:35.92
detachment right here don't get in the mix state detached decentralized command let the team

688
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:41.92
maneuver let them understand what the commander's intended is and let them maneuver towards victory

689
01:08:41.92 --> 01:08:48.40
you stay back a little bit monitor dive in there does that apply to because you're the one who

690
01:08:48.40 --> 01:08:54.56
kind of said this example to me one time I forget it was on here or not but you're like um it was

691
01:08:54.56 --> 01:08:59.84
about you when your kids tying their shoes you know let's say like I don't know you're late for school

692
01:08:59.84 --> 01:09:04.40
or running later whatever and they're having a hard time tying the shoes you're like let them

693
01:09:04.40 --> 01:09:08.64
tie the shoes don't jump in and be like oh do it you know kind of I did say that and I've said

694
01:09:08.64 --> 01:09:13.60
it a bunch of times that's a real simple example that that's a little bit more towards the last

695
01:09:13.60 --> 01:09:17.76
question or towards the last discussion that we just got into I mean if you let your if you

696
01:09:17.76 --> 01:09:21.44
if you tie your shoes for your kids all time they don't know on time yeah and furthermore you literally

697
01:09:21.44 --> 01:09:26.000
are taking away their opportunity to learn some fine motorcycles at that moment this is not the same

698
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.60
as that this is this is on a broader perspective your team is doing your team is in a firefight

699
01:09:34.48 --> 01:09:37.68
and you pick up your gun you go on the front line you start shooting at the enemy well now

700
01:09:37.68 --> 01:09:42.000
who's leading right now is looking around yeah this is the same as you know you're in a business

701
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.84
situation and your team is trying to come up with a plan and they're arguing amongst themselves

702
01:09:47.84 --> 01:09:52.16
and you jump in there and start arguing too now you don't have a good perception of you should

703
01:09:52.16 --> 01:09:55.84
be just standing back listening to the various arguments take place I'm not talking about

704
01:09:55.84 --> 01:09:59.52
arguments where people are young and screaming I'm talking about a discussion where they're

705
01:09:59.52 --> 01:10:04.56
arguing different possible courses of action if you dive right into those and you start becoming

706
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:10.64
involved at point blank range you lose all your perspective so instead you step back you don't you

707
01:10:10.64 --> 01:10:16.88
don't you don't go into the field yeah you don't dive into the argument you step back and you

708
01:10:16.88 --> 01:10:23.04
watch the fight unfold and then as the fight unfolds you see the best options because you're

709
01:10:23.04 --> 01:10:30.80
at altitude and you're not at point blank range one foot from the enemy fire yeah this is just

710
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:41.76
detached decentralized command next up 22 cause that enemies cause that the enemies know not

711
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:50.88
how thou right order thy army to fight and in what so ever manner that thou or dane stint

712
01:10:51.84 --> 01:10:56.72
make that the first band be received of the second and the third

713
01:10:56.72 --> 01:11:04.32
middle English get something what we talking about here well cause your enemies know not so that

714
01:11:04.32 --> 01:11:10.80
means you don't want your enemies to understand how you're gonna organize your your army to fight

715
01:11:10.80 --> 01:11:15.04
that's what this is you you want a confusion you don't want them to know exactly what you're

716
01:11:15.04 --> 01:11:21.92
going to do and then the second part make it make that the first band maybe received the second

717
01:11:21.92 --> 01:11:25.60
and third I'm pretty sure not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure that that's just talking about

718
01:11:25.60 --> 01:11:30.24
mutually supporting positions so you want to set your team up so that they can support each other

719
01:11:32.40 --> 01:11:36.48
so confuse the enemy don't give up the plan and set your teams up so they can help each other

720
01:11:36.48 --> 01:11:42.56
once your tea once a team is alone and unsupportable they're alone try not to let that happen

721
01:11:45.28 --> 01:11:54.64
23 in the fight never occupy a battle to any other thing then to the same for which thou

722
01:11:54.64 --> 01:12:04.96
hast appointed it if thou will to make no disorder it's a good day it's it's modern English

723
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:10.32
appreciation it makes it hard to they spell even words that you know they spell them all

724
01:12:10.32 --> 01:12:14.64
different and just so you know you're looking at this I actually tightened up some of the

725
01:12:14.64 --> 01:12:18.96
spelling and made some of the spelling more modern because I just could write it it was harder to

726
01:12:18.96 --> 01:12:23.68
track man yeah it's harder to track again this this thing was interpreted from Italian in

727
01:12:23.68 --> 01:12:35.04
1560 by George White had was getting after the translation yeah so it's it's interesting and

728
01:12:35.04 --> 01:12:39.04
this is the same thing you know I said that when we did Shakespeare it'll need to do more Shakespeare

729
01:12:39.04 --> 01:12:43.04
but people think all I should just understand Shakespeare you're not been understand Shakespeare

730
01:12:43.04 --> 01:12:48.64
it's almost a different language so you need to actually break it down like we're doing with

731
01:12:48.64 --> 01:13:02.80
these various statements so what this one is saying is don't use a company don't use a

732
01:13:03.52 --> 01:13:10.16
don't use a unit for purpose other than what you've assigned it unless you want to cause disorder

733
01:13:11.28 --> 01:13:16.64
unless you want to cause chaos so you got your team they're assigned to do this let them do that now

734
01:13:16.64 --> 01:13:22.64
obviously that can be problematic so we need to mitigate that because there's times when

735
01:13:22.64 --> 01:13:29.92
team is going to have to do something that you don't want it to do and so I'll give you a little

736
01:13:29.92 --> 01:13:38.08
example when you're doing an assault on a target you have two elements the base element and the

737
01:13:38.08 --> 01:13:43.44
maneuver element the base element is going to stay in position they're going to sneak up on the target

738
01:13:43.44 --> 01:13:49.84
and then the maneuver element's going to sneak over to the flank and then the base element's

739
01:13:49.84 --> 01:13:55.84
going to start firing massive fire power out the target and then the maneuver element after a little bit

740
01:13:55.84 --> 01:14:01.52
will stand up and start to go through the target they shift fire off the target and then you

741
01:14:01.52 --> 01:14:12.08
clear the target so when I was a young kid in the grooms person so we would you know like let's do

742
01:14:12.08 --> 01:14:15.84
this yeah so we're going to hit this target we're going to do a fire and maneuver on this target

743
01:14:15.84 --> 01:14:21.44
base and maneuver so what we would do is say okay let's take all of our heavy machine guns

744
01:14:22.16 --> 01:14:28.56
and put them in the base element and then the guys with the little pea shooters the little M16 pea

745
01:14:28.56 --> 01:14:32.88
shooters all those guys will be on the assault because they're light and they'll be able to maneuver

746
01:14:32.88 --> 01:14:38.32
really quickly through the get to the target and then go through the target makes perfect sense

747
01:14:38.32 --> 01:14:43.44
and I remember the first time I presented this type of plan to one of the old guys from

748
01:14:43.44 --> 01:14:51.20
nom is like no don't do that why not master chief this way we have more fire power in our base

749
01:14:51.20 --> 01:14:57.44
and our maneuver guys can maneuver more quickly here's the problem when that maneuver element is

750
01:14:57.44 --> 01:15:02.56
going towards the target what happens if they get compromised and contacted and now they're there

751
01:15:02.56 --> 01:15:06.40
the ones that have to lay down their base they can't get up and move because they're being shot at

752
01:15:06.40 --> 01:15:12.88
so guess who has to move the base element has to move and they can't move very well if they're

753
01:15:12.88 --> 01:15:18.72
only getting a cover fire from little pea shooters so you keep your integrity of your squad

754
01:15:18.72 --> 01:15:25.84
and you utilize them that way and it's like so what you want to do in this situation is you want to

755
01:15:25.84 --> 01:15:31.76
make sure that your elements can are capable of doing each others jobs maybe not to the fullest

756
01:15:31.76 --> 01:15:37.28
extent but they at least need to be somewhat capable so maybe you put one machine gun and they expected

757
01:15:37.28 --> 01:15:41.28
one extra machine gun and they expected base element and now you only have a couple of machine guns

758
01:15:41.28 --> 01:15:48.48
in the maneuver element but you got them if you need them so I don't 100% agree with that

759
01:15:49.36 --> 01:15:54.24
that being said you definitely want to let people do the job that they were assigned to do

760
01:15:55.12 --> 01:16:00.08
make sense right trained them you've assigned it let's let's try and keep the plan as it's

761
01:16:00.08 --> 01:16:07.36
supposed to be to the best of our ability but we're thinking we're not black and white here

762
01:16:07.36 --> 01:16:17.60
yeah leadership is not easy you know another thing is when you establish your teams you try and

763
01:16:17.60 --> 01:16:23.52
use those teams for everything if you can and again this is a dichotomy because as much as you

764
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:28.40
want to keep your teams together you also have to train them to be split up and broken up and

765
01:16:28.40 --> 01:16:34.32
combined and missed massed all together and I would always do this with all my fire teams so the

766
01:16:34.32 --> 01:16:38.32
fire teams would stick together as much as humanly possible but guess what I would also train them

767
01:16:38.32 --> 01:16:41.60
that if they were all scrambled up someone would step up take lead and that'd be a new fire team

768
01:16:42.32 --> 01:16:55.76
and we'd start making stuff happen next up 24 the so-dean accidents with difficulty are remedied

769
01:16:55.76 --> 01:17:06.64
those that are fought upon with faculty I had to look up so-dean because I couldn't even

770
01:17:06.64 --> 01:17:12.24
get a clue on what that one was but it's some sort of lead or a ruler it's actually a ruler

771
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:21.44
and this is so he's saying the so-dean accidents the leadership accidents with difficulty are remedied

772
01:17:21.44 --> 01:17:28.48
are hard to fix when leadership screws up it's hard to fix those that are fought upon

773
01:17:29.76 --> 01:17:37.12
are with difficulty are remedied if you use your head quickly so yeah there's gonna be

774
01:17:37.12 --> 01:17:47.52
leadership problems and their hard to fix unless you think and think quickly how can you improve

775
01:17:47.52 --> 01:17:54.56
your speed of thinking you know you can do that practice practice so

776
01:17:58.40 --> 01:18:02.56
let's say get experience to break because experience is the other practice yeah it's

777
01:18:02.56 --> 01:18:08.32
experienced if I've seen something before it's I'm gonna know thousand times faster how I'm in

778
01:18:08.32 --> 01:18:13.60
a reactor yeah if I haven't seen it before I'd takes me a while just to comprehend what's in front of my

779
01:18:13.60 --> 01:18:23.76
face yeah so that's why when we train we train to throw things okay so first of all when we train

780
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:29.04
we want to throw things at people that different scenarios different things happening where they

781
01:18:29.04 --> 01:18:35.68
start to get pattern recognition oh I've seen this type of thing before on top of that you also

782
01:18:35.68 --> 01:18:43.28
want to train people what to do or how to react when they've never seen it before they've never seen

783
01:18:43.28 --> 01:18:49.36
anything like this before because if I show you let's say i'm training you for well I guess one

784
01:18:49.36 --> 01:18:54.80
one is we'll just use a jitter turn right I'm training you for a jitter situation it's right

785
01:18:54.80 --> 01:18:57.60
and I teach you how to defend this and I teach you how to defend that and I teach you how to

786
01:18:57.60 --> 01:18:59.92
defend that and I teach you how to defend this and I teach you how to defend that right I teach you

787
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:05.28
how to defend ten different things and you get pretty good at it I also have to teach you

788
01:19:06.40 --> 01:19:11.04
a broad concept of what to do and there's something that you don't recognize so

789
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:15.68
So hey, if the guy grabs your arm, I want you to pull your arm here.

790
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:19.44
Hey, if the guy starts to go for your neck, I want you to swim your arm, your hand underneath

791
01:19:19.44 --> 01:19:20.80
and tuck your chin.

792
01:19:20.80 --> 01:19:24.72
If the guy starts pulling towards your back, I want you to shift your leg up and so he can't

793
01:19:24.72 --> 01:19:25.72
maneuver around there.

794
01:19:25.72 --> 01:19:30.48
So I'm going to give you exact steps to execute.

795
01:19:30.48 --> 01:19:36.000
If you see these things, and then I'm going to say this, if he's doing something you don't

796
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.96
recognize, here's what I want you to do.

797
01:19:37.96 --> 01:19:41.76
I want you to tuck your elbows in, I want you to posture, and I want you to control those

798
01:19:41.76 --> 01:19:42.76
hips.

799
01:19:42.76 --> 01:19:44.36
Oh, okay.

800
01:19:44.36 --> 01:19:47.20
And then you'll start to be able to recognize what's going on, at least you're going

801
01:19:47.20 --> 01:19:48.20
to survive.

802
01:19:48.20 --> 01:19:49.20
Yeah.

803
01:19:49.20 --> 01:19:52.04
I want you to detach and step back and say, what's he attacking?

804
01:19:52.04 --> 01:19:53.52
Same thing with combat.

805
01:19:53.52 --> 01:19:56.76
I'm going to train you like, hey, if he does this, you do that.

806
01:19:56.76 --> 01:19:59.68
If he does that, you do this.

807
01:19:59.68 --> 01:20:05.12
If you have no idea what's happening, here's what I want you to do.

808
01:20:05.12 --> 01:20:08.60
Get into a 360 degree perimeter, listen, right?

809
01:20:08.60 --> 01:20:13.68
I mean, whatever that situation is going to call for if you don't know what's happening.

810
01:20:13.68 --> 01:20:15.88
Like if I don't know where I'm getting flanked from or if I don't know where I'm getting

811
01:20:15.88 --> 01:20:20.28
shot at from, hey, everyone take a knee, get cover.

812
01:20:20.28 --> 01:20:22.28
Don't just start shooting because that's going to cause confusion.

813
01:20:22.28 --> 01:20:24.16
It's also going to give away our position.

814
01:20:24.16 --> 01:20:28.32
So what we're going to do, when it goes into a 360 degree perimeter, we're going to hold

815
01:20:28.32 --> 01:20:32.16
what we got, we're going to listen.

816
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:35.56
That's our, that's our, if we don't recognize what's happening, that's what we're

817
01:20:35.56 --> 01:20:36.56
new.

818
01:20:36.56 --> 01:20:39.52
So we have standard operating procedures for things that we recognize and we actually

819
01:20:39.52 --> 01:20:41.92
also have something to do if we don't recognize.

820
01:20:41.92 --> 01:20:44.48
We have a procedure for non-recognition.

821
01:20:44.48 --> 01:20:45.48
Yeah.

822
01:20:45.48 --> 01:20:47.04
Which is important.

823
01:20:47.04 --> 01:20:51.48
It's kind of like, I mean, it's different, I guess, but it kind of maybe fits in

824
01:20:51.48 --> 01:20:54.72
with you know how people expect the unexpected kind of thing.

825
01:20:54.72 --> 01:20:56.28
So it kind of fits in this.

826
01:20:56.28 --> 01:21:00.36
You're essentially trained for unexpected stuff like that.

827
01:21:00.36 --> 01:21:03.56
And we say, I would say go, one, yes, that's the important part.

828
01:21:03.56 --> 01:21:05.40
It's not just to expect the unexpected.

829
01:21:05.40 --> 01:21:09.28
It's have a protocol for when something unexpected happens.

830
01:21:09.28 --> 01:21:10.28
Yeah.

831
01:21:10.28 --> 01:21:11.40
Here's what we're going to do.

832
01:21:11.40 --> 01:21:12.40
Yeah.

833
01:21:12.40 --> 01:21:15.16
Because a lot of times when something unexpected, I'm thinking to you, it's

834
01:21:15.16 --> 01:21:16.16
to you.

835
01:21:16.16 --> 01:21:18.60
Because that's on purpose.

836
01:21:18.60 --> 01:21:21.92
You know, like these guys with these weird games, we're tall flexible guys.

837
01:21:21.92 --> 01:21:22.92
They're like that.

838
01:21:22.92 --> 01:21:24.48
They have these weird games.

839
01:21:24.48 --> 01:21:28.84
And they'll do stuff that they know, or they kind of rely upon you not and have seen

840
01:21:28.84 --> 01:21:29.84
it before.

841
01:21:29.84 --> 01:21:35.96
So they can capitalize when you start to panic, you know, or when you can, you know,

842
01:21:35.96 --> 01:21:42.40
if let's say your arm is out here, like there's some leg locks that require you to kind

843
01:21:42.40 --> 01:21:45.20
of try to spin out of it and then they'll catch you with something else, right?

844
01:21:45.20 --> 01:21:46.60
It's kind of that.

845
01:21:46.60 --> 01:21:51.60
So if you have a protocol that's just like, I don't know, whatever, the protocol is

846
01:21:51.60 --> 01:21:52.96
safety protocol.

847
01:21:52.96 --> 01:21:59.32
You know, it not only keeps you safe, just statistically speaking, you know, chances are,

848
01:21:59.32 --> 01:22:01.72
it'll keep you safe, but it'll jam up their game.

849
01:22:01.72 --> 01:22:02.72
Yeah.

850
01:22:02.72 --> 01:22:06.96
Overall, you know, especially these people that they capitalize on you panic, and

851
01:22:06.96 --> 01:22:07.96
not knowing what to do.

852
01:22:07.96 --> 01:22:08.96
Yeah.

853
01:22:08.96 --> 01:22:11.20
You know, and you want to have some kind of a reset position.

854
01:22:11.20 --> 01:22:14.80
And I used to use this with fighters like, hey, here's your reset position.

855
01:22:14.80 --> 01:22:18.60
Like just get to hear because you're comfortable there, get them under control, control

856
01:22:18.60 --> 01:22:20.24
their hips, whatever.

857
01:22:20.24 --> 01:22:21.24
Combat, same thing.

858
01:22:21.24 --> 01:22:23.68
Oh, your, your, your, your everyone's confused.

859
01:22:23.68 --> 01:22:24.68
Everyone's mixed up.

860
01:22:24.68 --> 01:22:25.68
Guys are all over the place.

861
01:22:25.68 --> 01:22:27.88
Let's get to a reset position in a building.

862
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:28.88
Yeah.

863
01:22:28.88 --> 01:22:29.88
Everyone knows where we are.

864
01:22:29.88 --> 01:22:30.88
We get it control of ourselves.

865
01:22:30.88 --> 01:22:31.88
Yeah.

866
01:22:31.88 --> 01:22:32.88
Business.

867
01:22:32.88 --> 01:22:33.88
Same thing.

868
01:22:33.88 --> 01:22:36.12
We got, we got scenario that we don't know what's happening.

869
01:22:36.12 --> 01:22:38.12
You know what, general quarters.

870
01:22:38.12 --> 01:22:40.88
Like, hey, we're all going to go to our normal positions.

871
01:22:40.88 --> 01:22:43.96
We're going to stand by because we don't know what's happening right now.

872
01:22:43.96 --> 01:22:47.56
So you've got to have not just to expect the unexpected.

873
01:22:47.56 --> 01:22:52.16
You've got to have a protocol to follow when something is occurring that you don't understand

874
01:22:52.16 --> 01:22:53.88
yet.

875
01:22:53.88 --> 01:22:56.20
Some kind of a reset position.

876
01:22:56.20 --> 01:22:59.80
Note that in your world.

877
01:22:59.80 --> 01:23:00.80
Next up.

878
01:23:00.80 --> 01:23:07.40
Number 25, men, iron, money and bread be the strength of the war.

879
01:23:07.40 --> 01:23:15.16
But of these four, the first two be most necessary because men and iron find money and

880
01:23:15.16 --> 01:23:21.44
bread, but money and bread find not men and iron.

881
01:23:21.44 --> 01:23:25.32
Yeah, that one's pretty pretty, pretty self explanatory.

882
01:23:25.32 --> 01:23:29.16
Now let's go to a business perspective here.

883
01:23:29.16 --> 01:23:35.20
A business perspective here because this can help people make decisions in the business

884
01:23:35.20 --> 01:23:40.60
world when you're going to make expenditures.

885
01:23:40.60 --> 01:23:50.12
When you are going to invest in something in your company, it is important to assess whether

886
01:23:50.12 --> 01:23:58.52
or not you are investing in something that is going to help you build is going to help you

887
01:23:58.52 --> 01:24:02.88
grow or if you're investing in something that is not.

888
01:24:02.88 --> 01:24:11.12
So for instance, let's say, hey, we could either take 50,000 dollars and remodel our

889
01:24:11.12 --> 01:24:18.80
current office or we can take 50,000 dollars and we can rent this new sub office in an

890
01:24:18.80 --> 01:24:23.16
more area that we don't have any presence in.

891
01:24:23.16 --> 01:24:26.04
So which one is a better investment?

892
01:24:26.04 --> 01:24:28.80
We don't really need that remodel of our office.

893
01:24:28.80 --> 01:24:32.28
This other thing is going to help us actually grow.

894
01:24:32.28 --> 01:24:35.88
So make sure that the investment that you're making, the first thing you want to invest

895
01:24:35.88 --> 01:24:38.32
in is men and iron.

896
01:24:38.32 --> 01:24:40.60
You don't want to invest in money and bread.

897
01:24:40.60 --> 01:24:43.72
Money and bread is going to be gone.

898
01:24:43.72 --> 01:24:46.72
And it doesn't reproduce itself.

899
01:24:46.72 --> 01:24:51.48
Whereas men and steel is going to get you more of that bread iron in the long run or

900
01:24:51.48 --> 01:24:53.72
sorry, bread and money.

901
01:24:53.72 --> 01:24:58.72
Alright, number 26.

902
01:24:58.72 --> 01:25:06.68
The unarmed rich man is a booty to the poor soldier.

903
01:25:06.68 --> 01:25:07.68
What does that mean?

904
01:25:07.68 --> 01:25:10.40
It means that the unarmed rich man is the prize for the poor soldier.

905
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:11.40
That sort of means.

906
01:25:11.40 --> 01:25:14.80
It means it means be armed.

907
01:25:14.80 --> 01:25:19.84
And this is the last one.

908
01:25:19.84 --> 01:25:22.84
Number 27.

909
01:25:22.84 --> 01:25:30.88
A custom thy soldiers to despise delicate living and luxurious apparel.

910
01:25:30.88 --> 01:25:33.76
I like that one.

911
01:25:33.76 --> 01:25:34.76
What does that mean?

912
01:25:34.76 --> 01:25:40.76
Get your people, get your soldiers to despise delicate living.

913
01:25:40.76 --> 01:25:45.48
Spise comfort despise luxurious clothing.

914
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:46.48
That's what I'm talking about.

915
01:25:46.48 --> 01:25:48.08
They'll be better soldiers.

916
01:25:48.08 --> 01:25:51.08
They'll be better people.

917
01:25:51.08 --> 01:25:53.08
You feel like I'm talking to you right now?

918
01:25:53.08 --> 01:25:54.08
What?

919
01:25:54.08 --> 01:25:55.08
The connoisseur of comfort.

920
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:56.08
It's a comfort.

921
01:25:56.08 --> 01:25:57.92
You know, in my firing line right now.

922
01:25:57.92 --> 01:25:59.92
Yeah, I did it, man.

923
01:25:59.92 --> 01:26:02.92
Obviously, I can't disagree with that because dang.

924
01:26:02.92 --> 01:26:03.92
Let me.

925
01:26:03.92 --> 01:26:05.56
Yeah.

926
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:08.96
When you've been uncomfortable for extended period of time, doesn't not make you a better

927
01:26:08.96 --> 01:26:09.96
person.

928
01:26:09.96 --> 01:26:10.96
Yeah, it does.

929
01:26:10.96 --> 01:26:11.96
There we go.

930
01:26:11.96 --> 01:26:12.96
Yeah.

931
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:14.44
You know, the whole idea, it becomes a bullet.

932
01:26:14.44 --> 01:26:18.32
We've told me the story of you because I know it doesn't reign a lot here, but you

933
01:26:18.32 --> 01:26:21.000
used your kettlebells in the rain and the other day.

934
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.96
You've told me that story two times in a two days in a row now.

935
01:26:24.96 --> 01:26:25.96
Sure.

936
01:26:25.96 --> 01:26:26.96
Right?

937
01:26:26.96 --> 01:26:27.96
Yes.

938
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:32.96
Today you told me that even Jade, your brother came out was impressed by your determination.

939
01:26:32.96 --> 01:26:33.96
Come in.

940
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:35.96
So what is it?

941
01:26:35.96 --> 01:26:36.96
What is it about?

942
01:26:36.96 --> 01:26:42.44
Is that that made you feel compelled to tell me about it and be, you know, for lack of

943
01:26:42.44 --> 01:26:47.48
a better word, pretty damn proud that you went out in the rain and did a kettlebell

944
01:26:47.48 --> 01:26:49.48
workout in the cold.

945
01:26:49.48 --> 01:26:50.48
Yes.

946
01:26:50.48 --> 01:26:53.08
Well, yeah, it's strong.

947
01:26:53.08 --> 01:26:54.08
And how did you feel inside?

948
01:26:54.08 --> 01:26:55.08
Well, it's strong.

949
01:26:55.08 --> 01:26:56.08
When it was over.

950
01:26:56.08 --> 01:26:57.08
Feel better.

951
01:26:57.08 --> 01:26:58.08
Yeah.

952
01:26:58.08 --> 01:26:59.08
This is it.

953
01:26:59.08 --> 01:27:00.08
Well, yeah, it makes me feel stronger.

954
01:27:00.08 --> 01:27:01.08
I'm asking you real questions right now.

955
01:27:01.08 --> 01:27:02.64
It might seem like I'm joking, but it's actually real.

956
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:03.64
You know why?

957
01:27:03.64 --> 01:27:05.64
Because this is a little step for you.

958
01:27:05.64 --> 01:27:10.80
There's other people that are listening that would benefit from hearing how taking this

959
01:27:10.80 --> 01:27:17.48
little step away from comfort really truly made you mentally and physically better.

960
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:18.48
Go echo Charles.

961
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:19.48
Right.

962
01:27:19.48 --> 01:27:23.36
Well, the, well, what can I start on that one?

963
01:27:23.36 --> 01:27:24.36
Okay.

964
01:27:24.36 --> 01:27:25.36
So, okay, yes.

965
01:27:25.36 --> 01:27:28.52
I go outside out of workout planned.

966
01:27:28.52 --> 01:27:32.40
It's raining, raining kind of hard to do by the way.

967
01:27:32.40 --> 01:27:33.76
And it's kind of cold.

968
01:27:33.76 --> 01:27:36.52
You've got to wear like a lot of clothes.

969
01:27:36.52 --> 01:27:39.44
So yes, I go ahead and do the whole workout hard too.

970
01:27:39.44 --> 01:27:42.52
And yes, remember that it was like dang, that's some dedication, whatever.

971
01:27:42.52 --> 01:27:47.36
But yes, so the feeling is, yeah, that I'm actually strong now.

972
01:27:47.36 --> 01:27:51.52
It's like basically when you break down it's like now you're strong, you're not weak.

973
01:27:51.52 --> 01:27:56.28
So weak would be like just the little is thing will throw you off your plan.

974
01:27:56.28 --> 01:28:00.40
You know, the little thing because you can't, because you're so used to comfort where

975
01:28:00.40 --> 01:28:02.88
you're so used to like the clothing thing.

976
01:28:02.88 --> 01:28:04.68
I mean, yeah, that's kind of weird too.

977
01:28:04.68 --> 01:28:08.92
Like if you always got to be wearing like nice clothes otherwise, like you're kind of

978
01:28:08.92 --> 01:28:09.92
you don't go out or something.

979
01:28:09.92 --> 01:28:10.92
I don't know.

980
01:28:10.92 --> 01:28:13.52
But it's kind of the same, it seems like the same concept.

981
01:28:13.52 --> 01:28:17.68
But yeah, if you can endure that stuff, then how do you feel when you're done?

982
01:28:17.68 --> 01:28:18.68
Better.

983
01:28:18.68 --> 01:28:22.80
Did you feel better after a workout in the cold rain where you went and gone after it,

984
01:28:22.80 --> 01:28:27.88
then you would have had it better just normal 70 degrees in sunny so cal.

985
01:28:27.88 --> 01:28:29.32
Yeah, a little bit.

986
01:28:29.32 --> 01:28:35.88
But I feel like it's, it was just more of a psychological thing, which does help

987
01:28:35.88 --> 01:28:40.44
big time because now you know that rain, you just prove to yourself that rain cold,

988
01:28:40.44 --> 01:28:42.16
whatever is not an excuse.

989
01:28:42.16 --> 01:28:44.16
It seems like I will be you.

990
01:28:44.16 --> 01:28:48.16
30 years, raining cold, isn't it?

991
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:49.16
It's no more.

992
01:28:49.16 --> 01:28:50.16
No more.

993
01:28:50.16 --> 01:28:51.16
Well, here's the thing.

994
01:28:51.16 --> 01:28:52.44
It's going to battle.

995
01:28:52.44 --> 01:28:54.44
You know what's funny?

996
01:28:54.44 --> 01:28:55.44
Here's a good, here's a good expression.

997
01:28:55.44 --> 01:28:59.28
You said in the day, it was better, when it was raining.

998
01:28:59.28 --> 01:29:02.72
You know, we'd say good operating weather.

999
01:29:02.72 --> 01:29:06.04
But it was kind of, it's true.

1000
01:29:06.04 --> 01:29:10.76
It's definitely true because when it's raining and when it's cold, guess what?

1001
01:29:10.76 --> 01:29:15.08
The people that are, you know, on watch your enemy, guess what they're doing?

1002
01:29:15.08 --> 01:29:16.08
They're hiding.

1003
01:29:16.08 --> 01:29:17.56
They're all bundled up in warmth.

1004
01:29:17.56 --> 01:29:22.40
So that makes it easier for you, plus there's noise from the rain, which camouflages

1005
01:29:22.40 --> 01:29:28.96
the noise that you're making walking through the jay or the woods or whatever.

1006
01:29:28.96 --> 01:29:29.96
But that's always a good one.

1007
01:29:29.96 --> 01:29:36.80
Whenever it's crappy weather, I always say to myself, good operating weather.

1008
01:29:36.80 --> 01:29:37.80
Yeah.

1009
01:29:37.80 --> 01:29:38.80
Kind of smile.

1010
01:29:38.80 --> 01:29:42.16
But we used to say to each other, it's like, you can't complain about it.

1011
01:29:42.16 --> 01:29:47.48
You just look at your body, it's like when you, when the door of the, of the heelotruck,

1012
01:29:47.48 --> 01:29:51.44
you know, the heelotruck is, no, back in the day we didn't have a lot of money from

1013
01:29:51.44 --> 01:29:52.44
budget.

1014
01:29:52.44 --> 01:29:56.88
And so we'd pretend that we were in helicopters and we'd be in the back of big trucks and

1015
01:29:56.88 --> 01:30:01.24
just drive out in the middle of the desert, open up the heelotruck and open it up, open up

1016
01:30:01.24 --> 01:30:03.76
the door and we jump out like we just got out of the helicopter.

1017
01:30:03.76 --> 01:30:09.60
Little did we know that when the war actually came, we would be using vehicles.

1018
01:30:09.60 --> 01:30:11.000
We used vehicles all the time.

1019
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.60
We had rare, I rarely, rarely used helicopters and I rack in Afghanistan.

1020
01:30:17.60 --> 01:30:19.76
They used helicopters a lot more.

1021
01:30:19.76 --> 01:30:23.32
But for me and I rack, foot patrol and heelotrucks.

1022
01:30:23.32 --> 01:30:24.76
But we didn't have to call him heelotrucks anymore.

1023
01:30:24.76 --> 01:30:26.000
Now we just called him trucks.

1024
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Sure.

1025
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:35.16
But when you're in a heelotruck in 1994, and you get driven up into the wherever, and

1026
01:30:35.16 --> 01:30:42.32
that door of the heelotruck opens up and it's raining and it's cold.

1027
01:30:42.32 --> 01:30:47.36
And as you're getting out of the truck, your last moment to communicate out loud to everyone.

1028
01:30:47.36 --> 01:30:49.32
You hear someone go good operating mother.

1029
01:30:49.32 --> 01:30:52.60
And you're like, yeah, this is going to suck.

1030
01:30:52.60 --> 01:30:53.60
Yeah.

1031
01:30:53.60 --> 01:30:54.60
Yeah.

1032
01:30:54.60 --> 01:31:02.36
If you're used to being uncomfortable, right, or if you like despise comfort, however

1033
01:31:02.36 --> 01:31:03.36
you put it.

1034
01:31:03.36 --> 01:31:04.36
Yeah.

1035
01:31:04.36 --> 01:31:05.36
It's not me.

1036
01:31:05.36 --> 01:31:06.36
It's a Macie Valley set.

1037
01:31:06.36 --> 01:31:07.84
It's despise comfort.

1038
01:31:07.84 --> 01:31:09.84
Dispising comfort.

1039
01:31:09.84 --> 01:31:13.24
Essentially you're getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1040
01:31:13.24 --> 01:31:14.84
You know, they say that, right?

1041
01:31:14.84 --> 01:31:15.84
They do.

1042
01:31:15.84 --> 01:31:16.84
They do.

1043
01:31:16.84 --> 01:31:17.84
So yeah, that's what they're doing.

1044
01:31:17.84 --> 01:31:22.12
So that's why yeah, just basically at the end of the improves your chance of success.

1045
01:31:22.12 --> 01:31:26.88
So may a roadblocks of discomfort come about in the future.

1046
01:31:26.88 --> 01:31:27.88
That's what I'm in.

1047
01:31:27.88 --> 01:31:28.88
Indeed.

1048
01:31:28.88 --> 01:31:35.20
And I think that not only will the rejection of comfort make better soldiers, it'll make

1049
01:31:35.20 --> 01:31:36.68
better people.

1050
01:31:36.68 --> 01:31:46.20
So yes, as you said, get out of your comfort zone, impose discipline and discomfort on yourself

1051
01:31:46.20 --> 01:31:51.80
and you will become a better person.

1052
01:31:51.80 --> 01:31:56.56
And that wraps up Macie Valley for now.

1053
01:31:56.56 --> 01:32:01.56
But echo speaking of getting out of our comfort zone.

1054
01:32:01.56 --> 01:32:05.32
And this is going to be a little dichotomy here.

1055
01:32:05.32 --> 01:32:11.20
But getting out of our comfort zone to become better, what recommendations do you have

1056
01:32:11.20 --> 01:32:13.04
for us to make that happen?

1057
01:32:13.04 --> 01:32:14.68
Like I said, there's going to be a dichotomy here.

1058
01:32:14.68 --> 01:32:15.68
Okay.

1059
01:32:15.68 --> 01:32:17.08
Because what do we have?

1060
01:32:17.08 --> 01:32:20.16
Well, well, there's a lot of things you have.

1061
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:23.52
But yes, so being the kind of sort of comfort.

1062
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:28.08
And so you're kind of the kind of sort of discomfort really in a way.

1063
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:29.40
I don't know about that.

1064
01:32:29.40 --> 01:32:31.40
Here's the thing, no.

1065
01:32:31.40 --> 01:32:33.24
I don't think about it much though.

1066
01:32:33.24 --> 01:32:34.24
You know what I mean?

1067
01:32:34.24 --> 01:32:36.36
I'd have to be actively thinking about it.

1068
01:32:36.36 --> 01:32:37.36
About what discomfort.

1069
01:32:37.36 --> 01:32:38.36
Just about anything.

1070
01:32:38.36 --> 01:32:40.80
I'm just over here doing what I'm doing.

1071
01:32:40.80 --> 01:32:42.52
I don't know what I mean.

1072
01:32:42.52 --> 01:32:43.52
This comfort.

1073
01:32:43.52 --> 01:32:44.52
Just, I don't care.

1074
01:32:44.52 --> 01:32:45.52
I don't care.

1075
01:32:45.52 --> 01:32:49.12
There's that old Viking saying.

1076
01:32:49.12 --> 01:32:51.36
It's like the rain is cold.

1077
01:32:51.36 --> 01:32:57.000
And the old Viking says, how can the rain be cold?

1078
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.16
Right?

1079
01:32:58.16 --> 01:32:59.64
The rain's not cold.

1080
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:01.32
Yeah, but I don't know.

1081
01:33:01.32 --> 01:33:02.32
I don't care.

1082
01:33:02.32 --> 01:33:04.36
How can the rain be cold?

1083
01:33:04.36 --> 01:33:06.52
If it's cold, then it's cold.

1084
01:33:06.52 --> 01:33:07.52
No, it's cold to you.

1085
01:33:07.52 --> 01:33:08.52
And it hits you.

1086
01:33:08.52 --> 01:33:09.52
The rain itself has cold.

1087
01:33:09.52 --> 01:33:10.52
That's a plan.

1088
01:33:10.52 --> 01:33:11.52
That's a plan work.

1089
01:33:11.52 --> 01:33:12.52
That's a plan work.

1090
01:33:12.52 --> 01:33:13.52
Yeah.

1091
01:33:13.52 --> 01:33:15.52
That's another good thing to think of yourself.

1092
01:33:15.52 --> 01:33:17.000
Another good thing to think of yourself.

1093
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.04
You only get wet once.

1094
01:33:19.04 --> 01:33:20.04
Yeah.

1095
01:33:20.04 --> 01:33:21.04
I've talked about that before.

1096
01:33:21.04 --> 01:33:22.04
Yeah.

1097
01:33:22.04 --> 01:33:24.48
You're waiting to go across the river.

1098
01:33:24.48 --> 01:33:25.48
You're looking for the best spot.

1099
01:33:25.48 --> 01:33:27.68
You're like, oh, no, you just get wet.

1100
01:33:27.68 --> 01:33:29.12
You're waiting to get wet one time.

1101
01:33:29.12 --> 01:33:30.12
What's your wet?

1102
01:33:30.12 --> 01:33:31.12
You're wet, doesn't matter.

1103
01:33:31.12 --> 01:33:32.12
Yeah.

1104
01:33:32.12 --> 01:33:33.12
It's true.

1105
01:33:33.12 --> 01:33:34.12
So like, suck it up.

1106
01:33:34.12 --> 01:33:35.28
The comfort thing is it's all.

1107
01:33:35.28 --> 01:33:38.92
It's like context as a huge.

1108
01:33:38.92 --> 01:33:39.92
Has a lot to do with it.

1109
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:43.68
Remember how I told you that time where it's like, you know, sometimes you can just

1110
01:33:43.68 --> 01:33:46.36
fall asleep on the floor or in the beach.

1111
01:33:46.36 --> 01:33:47.36
I don't know.

1112
01:33:47.36 --> 01:33:50.96
But then sometimes you get in your couch or wherever.

1113
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:52.12
You just can't fall asleep.

1114
01:33:52.12 --> 01:33:53.12
Can't get comfortable.

1115
01:33:53.12 --> 01:33:54.12
You know?

1116
01:33:54.12 --> 01:33:55.12
Interesting.

1117
01:33:55.12 --> 01:33:58.40
Because you expect the comfort is what I'm saying.

1118
01:33:58.40 --> 01:34:02.92
But if you don't have any comfortable expectations, it's like you just be, you're

1119
01:34:02.92 --> 01:34:03.92
just comfortable.

1120
01:34:03.92 --> 01:34:06.40
It's almost like you're just appreciative for eating kind of comfort.

1121
01:34:06.40 --> 01:34:11.40
But if you expect mass comfort, it's like you can't get enough comfort, you know?

1122
01:34:11.40 --> 01:34:12.80
Because you just expect more.

1123
01:34:12.80 --> 01:34:13.80
It's weird.

1124
01:34:13.80 --> 01:34:18.28
Like, um, okay, so you know, you have experience with cold water.

1125
01:34:18.28 --> 01:34:19.28
Right.

1126
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:20.56
Getting in and going to hit the surf.

1127
01:34:20.56 --> 01:34:21.80
Whatever.

1128
01:34:21.80 --> 01:34:24.32
So when you're there, how hard is that?

1129
01:34:24.32 --> 01:34:25.32
It's not.

1130
01:34:25.32 --> 01:34:26.32
Not right.

1131
01:34:26.32 --> 01:34:27.68
It's just like we're just doing it.

1132
01:34:27.68 --> 01:34:28.68
Yeah, this is what we're doing.

1133
01:34:28.68 --> 01:34:30.04
This is we're doing whatever.

1134
01:34:30.04 --> 01:34:31.04
It's cold.

1135
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:32.04
It sucks.

1136
01:34:32.04 --> 01:34:33.04
Whatever.

1137
01:34:33.04 --> 01:34:36.64
Even if it's, but here's the thing, this is me keeping mind, but still I think

1138
01:34:36.64 --> 01:34:38.48
it holds true.

1139
01:34:38.48 --> 01:34:40.08
So I'm getting in the shower the other day.

1140
01:34:40.08 --> 01:34:41.08
It's cold here.

1141
01:34:41.08 --> 01:34:43.72
California weather is cool.

1142
01:34:43.72 --> 01:34:44.72
I'm going to let the peep.

1143
01:34:44.72 --> 01:34:48.96
Well, Pete's going to understand because this is probably having to him too.

1144
01:34:48.96 --> 01:34:52.28
So listening, you know how you cold, you know, like it's just sort of cold.

1145
01:34:52.28 --> 01:34:53.28
Right.

1146
01:34:53.28 --> 01:34:56.68
So I'm going to, um, but take a shower and you know, the kind of when you turn on the shower

1147
01:34:56.68 --> 01:34:58.68
is it's not just doesn't come out all warm.

1148
01:34:58.68 --> 01:34:59.68
It's got a week.

1149
01:34:59.68 --> 01:35:00.96
It takes a few seconds or whatever.

1150
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:03.32
So so I turn it on and hits me.

1151
01:35:03.32 --> 01:35:08.72
Oh, because you take warm showers.

1152
01:35:08.72 --> 01:35:10.72
That day, that's your warm shower.

1153
01:35:10.72 --> 01:35:11.72
Anywhere understood.

1154
01:35:11.72 --> 01:35:17.76
Anywhere the cold water like kind of hit me and I was, oh, there's no way I could bear

1155
01:35:17.76 --> 01:35:20.000
going underneath that shower like before it gets warm.

1156
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
No way.

1157
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.36
No way.

1158
01:35:22.36 --> 01:35:26.24
But then, and then whatever it heats up, but I'm thinking like, not like the fuck,

1159
01:35:26.24 --> 01:35:30.76
joccal guys going that cold surf like for a long time and so then I'm thinking, no, it's

1160
01:35:30.76 --> 01:35:33.48
totally in context, you know.

1161
01:35:33.48 --> 01:35:37.36
Like if I, let's say a minute before I walked in the shower, I was like, I'm like,

1162
01:35:37.36 --> 01:35:39.36
cold shower right now.

1163
01:35:39.36 --> 01:35:41.68
Doing it literally the same exact time.

1164
01:35:41.68 --> 01:35:43.68
I could do it.

1165
01:35:43.68 --> 01:35:44.68
It seems like.

1166
01:35:44.68 --> 01:35:46.68
So it's like a mindset kind of thing.

1167
01:35:46.68 --> 01:35:47.68
And check.

1168
01:35:47.68 --> 01:35:49.68
Even aside from the training, of course.

1169
01:35:49.68 --> 01:35:54.68
I would say this in the reason that I can't, I mean, it's just like blank.

1170
01:35:54.68 --> 01:35:56.68
No, it's not here.

1171
01:35:56.68 --> 01:35:59.68
Maybe it is, but no, I don't know.

1172
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:00.68
Think about this.

1173
01:36:00.68 --> 01:36:02.68
We get out of bed, right?

1174
01:36:02.68 --> 01:36:04.68
Well, that again, your routine's different.

1175
01:36:04.68 --> 01:36:06.68
But yeah, let's say you're just sort of going.

1176
01:36:06.68 --> 01:36:07.68
I have an actual ice bath.

1177
01:36:07.68 --> 01:36:09.68
Yeah, but that's different too.

1178
01:36:09.68 --> 01:36:11.68
So, but I think I spent a lot of time.

1179
01:36:11.68 --> 01:36:12.68
Okay.

1180
01:36:12.68 --> 01:36:13.68
But that's the one.

1181
01:36:13.68 --> 01:36:16.68
I'm saying like, what if you get out of no out of bed or you're just cruising at home,

1182
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:20.68
which you probably don't do, but let's say you were, and it was just cold.

1183
01:36:20.68 --> 01:36:23.68
Kind of like, I'm pretty cold right now.

1184
01:36:23.68 --> 01:36:25.68
I should put on a jacket right now.

1185
01:36:25.68 --> 01:36:27.68
Let's do whatever.

1186
01:36:27.68 --> 01:36:28.68
That's how cold it is right now.

1187
01:36:28.68 --> 01:36:30.68
Not freezing, but just I'm cold right now.

1188
01:36:30.68 --> 01:36:32.68
I'm comfortably cold.

1189
01:36:32.68 --> 01:36:37.68
And then let's say your son comes with a couple of ice water and dumps it on you.

1190
01:36:37.68 --> 01:36:38.68
Right?

1191
01:36:38.68 --> 01:36:39.68
Yeah.

1192
01:36:39.68 --> 01:36:40.68
How are you sneak up on me?

1193
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:44.68
So you're saying, okay, maybe didn't sneak up on you.

1194
01:36:44.68 --> 01:36:45.68
Maybe he's, I don't know.

1195
01:36:45.68 --> 01:36:47.68
But let's say he poured ice water on you.

1196
01:36:47.68 --> 01:36:48.68
Okay.

1197
01:36:48.68 --> 01:36:50.68
You're telling me that you're like whatever.

1198
01:36:50.68 --> 01:36:51.68
That wouldn't.

1199
01:36:51.68 --> 01:36:54.68
You'd be Viking like can be like, oh, like, I don't know.

1200
01:36:54.68 --> 01:36:55.68
It's not cold.

1201
01:36:55.68 --> 01:36:58.68
Well, I tell you if he was looking for a reaction for me.

1202
01:36:58.68 --> 01:37:00.68
I wouldn't get it right.

1203
01:37:00.68 --> 01:37:01.68
Okay.

1204
01:37:01.68 --> 01:37:02.68
Which I did, I did it.

1205
01:37:02.68 --> 01:37:04.68
There would be a grappling match happening real quick though.

1206
01:37:04.68 --> 01:37:05.68
Yeah.

1207
01:37:05.68 --> 01:37:06.68
So yeah, and I understand.

1208
01:37:06.68 --> 01:37:08.68
I'm not saying that it would be nothing or something.

1209
01:37:08.68 --> 01:37:10.68
I'm saying that those two experiences are different.

1210
01:37:10.68 --> 01:37:11.68
Okay.

1211
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:12.68
So I'm talking about the actual physical.

1212
01:37:12.68 --> 01:37:14.68
Yeah, of course it's called water in you.

1213
01:37:14.68 --> 01:37:15.68
Yeah.

1214
01:37:15.68 --> 01:37:16.68
Yeah.

1215
01:37:16.68 --> 01:37:17.68
But it's so it's not nothing.

1216
01:37:17.68 --> 01:37:18.68
But it's something.

1217
01:37:18.68 --> 01:37:22.68
But that it compared that experience to if he came up in the, hey,

1218
01:37:22.68 --> 01:37:24.68
Dad, I have this cup of cold water.

1219
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:25.68
It's kind of cold right now.

1220
01:37:25.68 --> 01:37:27.68
Do you think you can like endure this, right?

1221
01:37:27.68 --> 01:37:29.68
And you're like, oh, yeah, I can endure it.

1222
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:30.68
Do it.

1223
01:37:30.68 --> 01:37:31.68
And he did it.

1224
01:37:31.68 --> 01:37:33.68
I'm not saying that would be nothing or something.

1225
01:37:33.68 --> 01:37:35.68
I'm saying that those two experiences are different.

1226
01:37:35.68 --> 01:37:36.68
Okay.

1227
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:37.68
Yeah.

1228
01:37:37.68 --> 01:37:38.68
Same same.

1229
01:37:38.68 --> 01:37:40.68
So this is the, this is element of surprise.

1230
01:37:40.68 --> 01:37:41.68
Is all we're talking about.

1231
01:37:41.68 --> 01:37:42.68
One year is the surprise.

1232
01:37:42.68 --> 01:37:43.68
One you're not.

1233
01:37:43.68 --> 01:37:46.68
If you're surprised, it's going to throw you off a little bit.

1234
01:37:46.68 --> 01:37:47.68
Yeah.

1235
01:37:47.68 --> 01:37:48.68
If you're not surprised, you're brazed for it.

1236
01:37:48.68 --> 01:37:49.68
You're good to go.

1237
01:37:49.68 --> 01:37:49.68
Yeah.

1238
01:37:49.68 --> 01:37:54.68
I mean, if surprise is just one element of a different context where you don't necessarily

1239
01:37:54.68 --> 01:37:55.68
Okay.

1240
01:37:55.68 --> 01:37:57.68
So surprise and mental preparation.

1241
01:37:57.68 --> 01:38:00.68
Mental preparation is I think the overarching.

1242
01:38:00.68 --> 01:38:03.68
Because surprise would fall under the mental preparation.

1243
01:38:03.68 --> 01:38:04.68
I love going on.

1244
01:38:04.68 --> 01:38:05.68
Same same.

1245
01:38:05.68 --> 01:38:10.68
I'm telling you that shower experience kind of enlightened being a little bit anyway.

1246
01:38:10.68 --> 01:38:11.68
Okay.

1247
01:38:11.68 --> 01:38:13.68
Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1248
01:38:13.68 --> 01:38:15.68
That's a jujitsu thing too.

1249
01:38:15.68 --> 01:38:18.68
By the way, is that where you heard it mainly?

1250
01:38:18.68 --> 01:38:21.68
I don't, maybe that's where I first heard it.

1251
01:38:21.68 --> 01:38:22.68
Yeah.

1252
01:38:22.68 --> 01:38:23.68
Because that's a good thing to have.

1253
01:38:23.68 --> 01:38:24.68
Oh, yeah.

1254
01:38:24.68 --> 01:38:29.68
That's the backhanded compliment that Hicks and Grace, he told me when I rolled with him back

1255
01:38:29.68 --> 01:38:30.68
in the day.

1256
01:38:30.68 --> 01:38:31.68
What?

1257
01:38:31.68 --> 01:38:38.68
He goes, he said, you're very comfortable when you're in really bad positions.

1258
01:38:38.68 --> 01:38:40.68
And I was all happy.

1259
01:38:40.68 --> 01:38:41.68
Yeah.

1260
01:38:41.68 --> 01:38:42.68
There you go.

1261
01:38:42.68 --> 01:38:43.68
He was good at jujitsu.

1262
01:38:43.68 --> 01:38:44.68
Yes.

1263
01:38:44.68 --> 01:38:45.68
So.

1264
01:38:45.68 --> 01:38:46.68
Yeah.

1265
01:38:46.68 --> 01:38:47.68
That's what I heard too.

1266
01:38:47.68 --> 01:38:48.68
But yeah.

1267
01:38:48.68 --> 01:38:51.68
So that means, dude, you did two kind of really?

1268
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:53.68
That last strategy.

1269
01:38:53.68 --> 01:38:55.68
What do you call it rules general rule?

1270
01:38:55.68 --> 01:38:56.68
Yeah.

1271
01:38:56.68 --> 01:38:59.68
Is essentially despised delicate living?

1272
01:38:59.68 --> 01:39:01.68
No, it is not.

1273
01:39:01.68 --> 01:39:02.68
It's not delicate.

1274
01:39:02.68 --> 01:39:04.68
But it's not brutal.

1275
01:39:04.68 --> 01:39:06.68
Depends who you're all with.

1276
01:39:06.68 --> 01:39:07.68
Yeah, that's true.

1277
01:39:07.68 --> 01:39:08.68
Very true.

1278
01:39:08.68 --> 01:39:10.68
There was some blood on the mat last night.

1279
01:39:10.68 --> 01:39:12.68
Boy, I believe.

1280
01:39:12.68 --> 01:39:13.68
Anyway, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1281
01:39:13.68 --> 01:39:21.68
If we're not in jujitsu already, we might not agree on the different mindsets for cold and all that.

1282
01:39:21.68 --> 01:39:22.68
But we do agree.

1283
01:39:22.68 --> 01:39:23.68
Do some jujitsu.

1284
01:39:23.68 --> 01:39:24.68
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1285
01:39:24.68 --> 01:39:27.68
And when you do it, you're going to need a gear and what gear do you get?

1286
01:39:27.68 --> 01:39:30.68
None of the other thing that he's ever made.

1287
01:39:30.68 --> 01:39:35.68
100% in America from top to bottom, from origin, origin main dot com.

1288
01:39:35.68 --> 01:39:36.68
That's where you get them.

1289
01:39:36.68 --> 01:39:39.68
You get whatever you want on there.

1290
01:39:39.68 --> 01:39:40.68
And you can you garage cards.

1291
01:39:40.68 --> 01:39:41.68
So you can do no guiswell.

1292
01:39:41.68 --> 01:39:52.68
And then you can get t-shirts and hoodies, which you're comfortable, which are the antithesis of what we're talking about.

1293
01:39:52.68 --> 01:39:53.68
Yes.

1294
01:39:53.68 --> 01:40:09.68
Because you have claimed, and now this claim has been supported on a social media sites around the world that the origin jogger pants, which I don't wear, are universally the most comfortable pants of all time.

1295
01:40:09.68 --> 01:40:10.68
Yes.

1296
01:40:10.68 --> 01:40:11.68
Yeah.

1297
01:40:11.68 --> 01:40:15.68
Still, I mean, I went on searches like my son got a pair for Christmas.

1298
01:40:15.68 --> 01:40:19.68
Could you know when you're in my family, guess what you're getting for Christmas?

1299
01:40:19.68 --> 01:40:23.68
Yeah.

1300
01:40:23.68 --> 01:40:27.68
So he got a pair and I tried them on and he was like, you got to take them on.

1301
01:40:27.68 --> 01:40:29.68
They look as they just don't look.

1302
01:40:29.68 --> 01:40:32.68
Because you don't match, they just not, they're not me.

1303
01:40:32.68 --> 01:40:38.68
Yeah, because joggers as functional as they are, because they're super functional as far as jogging and running.

1304
01:40:38.68 --> 01:40:41.68
It's functional as they are, that's a style thing.

1305
01:40:41.68 --> 01:40:43.68
Like they're in style right now.

1306
01:40:43.68 --> 01:40:48.68
But that somehow related to skinny jeans, are they not?

1307
01:40:48.68 --> 01:40:51.68
So they're related, that's the look related.

1308
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:54.68
So you, yeah, you can't wear skinny jeans.

1309
01:40:54.68 --> 01:40:58.68
They used to issue, when I was at Seal Team 2, Seal Team 1 we didn't have it.

1310
01:40:58.68 --> 01:41:03.68
Seal Team 2, they issued us joggers, but this is back in the day.

1311
01:41:03.68 --> 01:41:07.68
They were basically like the same thing.

1312
01:41:07.68 --> 01:41:12.68
Because it was cold in the winter time and the guys would want to run with those things on.

1313
01:41:12.68 --> 01:41:14.68
But I didn't wear those either.

1314
01:41:14.68 --> 01:41:18.68
But everybody else can work. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they're outer, they weren't under the air.

1315
01:41:18.68 --> 01:41:22.68
We were wearing them like over your running shorts.

1316
01:41:22.68 --> 01:41:24.68
Oh, okay. Yeah. Cool. There you go.

1317
01:41:24.68 --> 01:41:29.68
Yeah. But these are these are probably going to be way more comfortable going from origin.

1318
01:41:29.68 --> 01:41:32.68
And they're made in America. By the way, I don't know if I mentioned that.

1319
01:41:32.68 --> 01:41:34.68
But yeah, those are good joggers.

1320
01:41:34.68 --> 01:41:36.68
Here's the thing, you despise comfort.

1321
01:41:36.68 --> 01:41:37.68
Well, I don't think you despise comfort.

1322
01:41:37.68 --> 01:41:39.68
Not as much as I should.

1323
01:41:39.68 --> 01:41:41.68
Yeah, okay, that makes sense to me.

1324
01:41:41.68 --> 01:41:45.68
Don't despise comfort. Just like I don't despise the rest between sets.

1325
01:41:45.68 --> 01:41:49.68
Because comfort is there for reason when you're kind of cold.

1326
01:41:49.68 --> 01:41:51.68
I guess that's what I was going to say earlier.

1327
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:55.68
You enjoy comfort more when you have discomfort.

1328
01:41:55.68 --> 01:42:00.68
Yes, right? Oh, you don't want to be the person that's constantly in a feather pillow

1329
01:42:00.68 --> 01:42:02.68
temperature controlled scenario.

1330
01:42:02.68 --> 01:42:07.68
You want to be in like the tough environment and then you're like, oh, this feels good now.

1331
01:42:07.68 --> 01:42:10.68
Yeah. Like when you get out of the one you've been surfing and it's cold.

1332
01:42:10.68 --> 01:42:13.68
I went surfing the other day with no wetsuit on.

1333
01:42:13.68 --> 01:42:15.68
And it's wintertime here, by the way.

1334
01:42:15.68 --> 01:42:20.68
But one of my two actually of my toes were nums.

1335
01:42:20.68 --> 01:42:21.68
Straight on your white.

1336
01:42:21.68 --> 01:42:23.68
How cold is that?

1337
01:42:23.68 --> 01:42:24.68
I mean, like what 55?

1338
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:25.68
Yeah, I feel like that.

1339
01:42:25.68 --> 01:42:27.68
I mean, I only went for like 45 minutes.

1340
01:42:27.68 --> 01:42:29.68
But yeah, I was cold when I got done.

1341
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:30.68
Yeah.

1342
01:42:30.68 --> 01:42:33.68
And then I went into jacuzzi.

1343
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:35.68
It felt good.

1344
01:42:35.68 --> 01:42:36.68
Yes.

1345
01:42:36.68 --> 01:42:38.68
So really not despise that comfort.

1346
01:42:38.68 --> 01:42:39.68
Yeah.

1347
01:42:39.68 --> 01:42:45.68
But it felt even better than if it was just a normal day and I wasn't didn't have a numb two toes.

1348
01:42:45.68 --> 01:42:46.68
Yeah.

1349
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:50.68
So really it's more about the ability to endure discomfort.

1350
01:42:50.68 --> 01:42:51.68
That's really what it is.

1351
01:42:51.68 --> 01:42:58.68
So the the last time you spend uncomfortable, the less you used to it, you'll be so the more like, you know,

1352
01:42:58.68 --> 01:43:01.68
the less capable you'll be of enduring it.

1353
01:43:01.68 --> 01:43:02.68
Yeah.

1354
01:43:02.68 --> 01:43:04.68
Kind of that's kind of the thing.

1355
01:43:04.68 --> 01:43:05.68
Yeah.

1356
01:43:05.68 --> 01:43:06.68
Jack, what they're going for?

1357
01:43:06.68 --> 01:43:07.68
Anyway,

1358
01:43:07.68 --> 01:43:11.68
to watch guards, t-shirts, joggers, supplements, supplements, of course.

1359
01:43:11.68 --> 01:43:16.68
Joint supplements, which have shaken out to be the most important supplements.

1360
01:43:16.68 --> 01:43:18.68
There are that it's true.

1361
01:43:18.68 --> 01:43:19.68
Or indeed.

1362
01:43:19.68 --> 01:43:24.68
For a semi to moderate to highly active person, that's it.

1363
01:43:24.68 --> 01:43:25.68
Yeah.

1364
01:43:25.68 --> 01:43:26.68
I know this firsthand.

1365
01:43:26.68 --> 01:43:27.68
Definitely.

1366
01:43:27.68 --> 01:43:29.68
So joint warfare,

1367
01:43:29.68 --> 01:43:30.68
krill oil.

1368
01:43:30.68 --> 01:43:33.68
Those are for your joints and for your whole life.

1369
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:36.68
Like the stuff that's in joint warfare.

1370
01:43:36.68 --> 01:43:39.68
To America, it has all kind.

1371
01:43:39.68 --> 01:43:42.68
It's not just like, yeah, it's good for your joints, but it's good for a little.

1372
01:43:42.68 --> 01:43:43.68
It's good for everything.

1373
01:43:43.68 --> 01:43:44.68
Yeah.

1374
01:43:44.68 --> 01:43:48.68
Which is as I was, you know, reading more about it.

1375
01:43:48.68 --> 01:43:50.68
Oh, no, there was an article that spring up.

1376
01:43:50.68 --> 01:43:51.68
That's what it was.

1377
01:43:51.68 --> 01:43:54.68
And I was like, wow, I didn't know that all this no wonder I feel so good.

1378
01:43:54.68 --> 01:43:55.68
Yeah.

1379
01:43:55.68 --> 01:43:58.68
Anyway, don't wear for a krill oil discipline.

1380
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:01.68
There's also, so discipline comes in lemon lime, which is tasty.

1381
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:04.68
There's also the new.

1382
01:44:04.68 --> 01:44:06.68
Chopper thunder.

1383
01:44:06.68 --> 01:44:07.68
Because I couldn't call it.

1384
01:44:07.68 --> 01:44:10.68
We couldn't call it peanut kaleada because that just not happening.

1385
01:44:10.68 --> 01:44:11.68
No, no, no.

1386
01:44:11.68 --> 01:44:13.68
That was just a big negative.

1387
01:44:13.68 --> 01:44:14.68
And then there's milk.

1388
01:44:14.68 --> 01:44:16.68
Of course.

1389
01:44:16.68 --> 01:44:18.68
Additional protein, additional protein.

1390
01:44:18.68 --> 01:44:20.68
That taste delicious.

1391
01:44:20.68 --> 01:44:21.68
That taste like a dessert.

1392
01:44:21.68 --> 01:44:22.68
A for real dessert though.

1393
01:44:22.68 --> 01:44:23.68
Yeah.

1394
01:44:23.68 --> 01:44:27.68
And if you have kids or if you just, well, if you have kids,

1395
01:44:27.68 --> 01:44:29.68
you get them warm your kid milk,

1396
01:44:29.68 --> 01:44:33.68
which is the best possible thing you can buy a child for food.

1397
01:44:33.68 --> 01:44:36.68
In my opinion, taste, well, I guess we give steak.

1398
01:44:36.68 --> 01:44:39.68
Sure, I think vegetables are good too.

1399
01:44:39.68 --> 01:44:41.68
I'd even like steak when I was a little kid.

1400
01:44:41.68 --> 01:44:42.68
Yeah, you like burgers.

1401
01:44:42.68 --> 01:44:43.68
Yeah, I like burgers.

1402
01:44:43.68 --> 01:44:46.68
But you're more refined now.

1403
01:44:46.68 --> 01:44:47.68
It's luxurious now.

1404
01:44:47.68 --> 01:44:48.68
Yeah, it's a while.

1405
01:44:48.68 --> 01:44:51.68
It's an acquired taste getting into the steak thing.

1406
01:44:51.68 --> 01:44:52.68
Huh, yeah.

1407
01:44:52.68 --> 01:44:53.68
Interesting.

1408
01:44:53.68 --> 01:44:54.68
Possibly learn how to cook it better.

1409
01:44:54.68 --> 01:44:55.68
Yeah.

1410
01:44:55.68 --> 01:44:57.68
So yeah, warrior kid milk.

1411
01:44:57.68 --> 01:45:01.68
And all that stuff from origin, you can get it origin main.com.

1412
01:45:01.68 --> 01:45:04.68
Also, jacos store.

1413
01:45:04.68 --> 01:45:06.68
It's called jacos store.

1414
01:45:06.68 --> 01:45:08.68
So go to jacos.com.

1415
01:45:08.68 --> 01:45:11.68
And this is where you can get shirts.

1416
01:45:11.68 --> 01:45:13.68
They represent the path.

1417
01:45:13.68 --> 01:45:15.68
I want to represent this clinical freedom.

1418
01:45:15.68 --> 01:45:17.68
This clinical freedom shirt.

1419
01:45:17.68 --> 01:45:19.68
Here, and this is what I realized this.

1420
01:45:19.68 --> 01:45:23.68
I know, I think maybe a little bit too much into it.

1421
01:45:23.68 --> 01:45:25.68
But this happened though.

1422
01:45:25.68 --> 01:45:28.68
When you wear a discipline equals freedom shirt to work out.

1423
01:45:28.68 --> 01:45:30.68
You like won't skip the workout.

1424
01:45:30.68 --> 01:45:32.68
You'll be more into the workout.

1425
01:45:32.68 --> 01:45:33.68
I noticed that.

1426
01:45:33.68 --> 01:45:34.68
Yeah.

1427
01:45:34.68 --> 01:45:36.68
Because you look at it and says discipline equals freedom.

1428
01:45:36.68 --> 01:45:39.68
You know, it's like your representing what it's actually saying.

1429
01:45:39.68 --> 01:45:44.68
It's not one of these deals where it's like, oh, a cool star on your shirt or something.

1430
01:45:44.68 --> 01:45:45.68
Which is cool.

1431
01:45:45.68 --> 01:45:48.68
There's people that have taken that idea to the next level and gotten the

1432
01:45:48.68 --> 01:45:51.68
Displonicals freedom tattoos.

1433
01:45:51.68 --> 01:45:53.68
See, same exact concept.

1434
01:45:53.68 --> 01:45:54.68
And yeah, man.

1435
01:45:54.68 --> 01:45:57.68
I've seen it in like one dude has the dysmicals freedom.

1436
01:45:57.68 --> 01:46:00.68
I think it's basically on the inside of his wrist.

1437
01:46:00.68 --> 01:46:02.68
Try eating a donut with that hand.

1438
01:46:02.68 --> 01:46:04.68
Oh, no, it's not exactly that.

1439
01:46:04.68 --> 01:46:05.68
There's no way.

1440
01:46:05.68 --> 01:46:06.68
That's exactly that.

1441
01:46:06.68 --> 01:46:08.68
If that happened, you'd be in serious violation.

1442
01:46:08.68 --> 01:46:09.68
Yeah.

1443
01:46:09.68 --> 01:46:10.68
Like you couldn't do it.

1444
01:46:10.68 --> 01:46:11.68
You'd feel it.

1445
01:46:11.68 --> 01:46:13.68
Like you'd be doing burpees for like 45 minutes.

1446
01:46:13.68 --> 01:46:14.68
Yeah.

1447
01:46:14.68 --> 01:46:14.68
After that.

1448
01:46:14.68 --> 01:46:15.68
Yeah.

1449
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:18.68
You see an eye posted a picture of the guy with it on the internet.

1450
01:46:18.68 --> 01:46:19.68
Yeah, that's not.

1451
01:46:19.68 --> 01:46:20.68
No.

1452
01:46:20.68 --> 01:46:21.68
There's one guy that has it on sub-sum.

1453
01:46:21.68 --> 01:46:23.68
You talking about the one guy that has it on the wrist.

1454
01:46:23.68 --> 01:46:24.68
Yeah, that's the one.

1455
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:25.68
It's the one that really has the stamp.

1456
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:26.68
Yeah.

1457
01:46:26.68 --> 01:46:27.68
That's the real call.

1458
01:46:27.68 --> 01:46:28.68
Yeah.

1459
01:46:28.68 --> 01:46:29.68
That's the one I took the picture.

1460
01:46:29.68 --> 01:46:30.68
But yeah, I saw that.

1461
01:46:30.68 --> 01:46:31.68
It was good.

1462
01:46:31.68 --> 01:46:32.68
See same exact concept, man.

1463
01:46:32.68 --> 01:46:33.68
Yeah.

1464
01:46:33.68 --> 01:46:36.68
Because yeah, you can't not represent now, you know, got the shirt on.

1465
01:46:36.68 --> 01:46:37.68
Boom, you got the tattoo now.

1466
01:46:37.68 --> 01:46:39.68
You can never not represent.

1467
01:46:39.68 --> 01:46:40.68
Or you're going to pay the price.

1468
01:46:40.68 --> 01:46:41.68
Yeah.

1469
01:46:41.68 --> 01:46:42.68
To yourself, by the way.

1470
01:46:42.68 --> 01:46:43.68
You know, so it's like a stamp.

1471
01:46:43.68 --> 01:46:44.68
I dig it, man.

1472
01:46:44.68 --> 01:46:45.68
I dig it respect.

1473
01:46:45.68 --> 01:46:48.68
Also, we get that tattoo.

1474
01:46:48.68 --> 01:46:51.68
I think you should only get that tattoo.

1475
01:46:51.68 --> 01:46:54.68
If you.

1476
01:46:54.68 --> 01:46:56.68
You need to commit first, right?

1477
01:46:56.68 --> 01:46:57.68
Yeah.

1478
01:46:57.68 --> 01:47:00.68
You commit first and then get the tattoo.

1479
01:47:00.68 --> 01:47:03.68
Don't think that just the tattoo is going to push you over the edge.

1480
01:47:03.68 --> 01:47:05.68
Even though, probably, well, you know, right?

1481
01:47:05.68 --> 01:47:08.68
But maybe that's not the best approach for tattoo decision making.

1482
01:47:08.68 --> 01:47:09.68
That's what you're saying.

1483
01:47:09.68 --> 01:47:17.68
Either way, yeah, anyway, it's called jockelstore.com, you know, the shirt and before you get the tattoo, get the t-shirt.

1484
01:47:17.68 --> 01:47:18.68
Get the shirt first.

1485
01:47:18.68 --> 01:47:19.68
Yeah.

1486
01:47:19.68 --> 01:47:20.68
Get a hat.

1487
01:47:20.68 --> 01:47:21.68
Get a hat.

1488
01:47:21.68 --> 01:47:25.68
There's a lot of cool stuff in your- in the game cool, then you can step it up a little bit more.

1489
01:47:25.68 --> 01:47:26.68
Cody's.

1490
01:47:26.68 --> 01:47:27.68
Yes.

1491
01:47:27.68 --> 01:47:28.68
Women's stuff.

1492
01:47:28.68 --> 01:47:30.68
I'm going to have some new stuff on there too.

1493
01:47:30.68 --> 01:47:31.68
You keep saying that.

1494
01:47:31.68 --> 01:47:33.68
I know, but, you know, I'm going to do it.

1495
01:47:33.68 --> 01:47:35.68
Meanwhile, is there patches right now?

1496
01:47:35.68 --> 01:47:36.68
We out of patches.

1497
01:47:36.68 --> 01:47:37.68
Oh, well.

1498
01:47:37.68 --> 01:47:38.68
I don't know.

1499
01:47:38.68 --> 01:47:40.68
Let me double check.

1500
01:47:40.68 --> 01:47:43.68
Let me check with the guy that's in charge of an tattoo.

1501
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:44.68
Oh, wait, that's you.

1502
01:47:46.68 --> 01:47:47.68
All right.

1503
01:47:47.68 --> 01:47:48.68
Well, rest assured.

1504
01:47:48.68 --> 01:47:49.68
Hey, good.

1505
01:47:49.68 --> 01:47:51.68
If you see something cool, get something.

1506
01:47:51.68 --> 01:47:53.68
If something sold out or something like that.

1507
01:47:53.68 --> 01:47:55.68
No, no, no, let me know.

1508
01:47:55.68 --> 01:47:56.68
I guess.

1509
01:47:56.68 --> 01:47:57.68
No, you know what?

1510
01:47:57.68 --> 01:47:58.68
It won't be.

1511
01:47:58.68 --> 01:47:59.68
Or it'll be on the way.

1512
01:47:59.68 --> 01:48:01.68
Either way, it's called jockelstore.com.

1513
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:02.68
A lot of cool stuff on there.

1514
01:48:02.68 --> 01:48:04.68
If you want something, you want to represent in the wild.

1515
01:48:04.68 --> 01:48:05.68
In the wild, that way.

1516
01:48:05.68 --> 01:48:06.68
Get something.

1517
01:48:06.68 --> 01:48:08.68
Also, jockel white tea.

1518
01:48:08.68 --> 01:48:11.68
On the store that we saw that on the store too, by the way,

1519
01:48:11.68 --> 01:48:12.68
in jockels.

1520
01:48:12.68 --> 01:48:13.68
But you can get this.

1521
01:48:13.68 --> 01:48:15.68
Yeah, it's good.

1522
01:48:15.68 --> 01:48:17.68
I'm going to get it from Amazon as well.

1523
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:18.68
Where else?

1524
01:48:18.68 --> 01:48:22.68
Guess what I'm drinking right now.

1525
01:48:22.68 --> 01:48:24.68
Jockel hot tea.

1526
01:48:24.68 --> 01:48:25.68
You know why comfortable?

1527
01:48:25.68 --> 01:48:26.68
Because it's a little bit cold.

1528
01:48:26.68 --> 01:48:27.68
I'm going to get the cow up.

1529
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:28.68
See?

1530
01:48:28.68 --> 01:48:29.68
Boss, it.

1531
01:48:29.68 --> 01:48:30.68
Hey, not not.

1532
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:31.68
And make it make it.

1533
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:32.68
Yeah, it makes sense.

1534
01:48:32.68 --> 01:48:34.68
You're no stranger to discomfort.

1535
01:48:34.68 --> 01:48:36.68
So I think you can't, you know, whatever.

1536
01:48:36.68 --> 01:48:38.68
But yeah, jockel white tea is one of those deals where

1537
01:48:38.68 --> 01:48:42.68
even if you don't like tea that much, you'll probably live in this.

1538
01:48:42.68 --> 01:48:43.68
It doesn't.

1539
01:48:43.68 --> 01:48:46.68
It tastes like tea, but it doesn't taste like tea.

1540
01:48:46.68 --> 01:48:48.68
Can I say that? Is that making any sense?

1541
01:48:48.68 --> 01:48:50.68
Yeah, you know, if you drink it, that makes it a codomy.

1542
01:48:50.68 --> 01:48:53.68
This is a kind of jockel white tea.

1543
01:48:53.68 --> 01:48:55.68
But there's no dichotomy in the factory.

1544
01:48:55.68 --> 01:48:58.68
There's a reason why I'm teaching the, the, the, the,

1545
01:48:58.68 --> 01:49:01.68
the jutsu class at the master and he used the word dichotomy and then

1546
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:02.68
everyone started laughing.

1547
01:49:02.68 --> 01:49:05.68
Yeah, because the way he says it is like directly,

1548
01:49:05.68 --> 01:49:07.68
he's directly mocking me.

1549
01:49:07.68 --> 01:49:09.68
Yeah, he's a newer dichotomy.

1550
01:49:09.68 --> 01:49:10.68
Yep.

1551
01:49:10.68 --> 01:49:11.68
So yeah.

1552
01:49:11.68 --> 01:49:14.68
So yeah, jocquity outstanding stuff.

1553
01:49:14.68 --> 01:49:16.68
Makes you dead, Lefa, it doesn't pounds.

1554
01:49:16.68 --> 01:49:17.68
But we already knew that.

1555
01:49:17.68 --> 01:49:18.68
Yeah, everyone knows that.

1556
01:49:18.68 --> 01:49:19.68
Yeah, yeah.

1557
01:49:19.68 --> 01:49:21.68
I mean, what do I dead left has increased a lot?

1558
01:49:21.68 --> 01:49:26.68
Yep. Also, it's in cans, which is good for me because

1559
01:49:26.68 --> 01:49:29.68
the whole brewing tea sequence.

1560
01:49:29.68 --> 01:49:30.68
Uncomfortable.

1561
01:49:30.68 --> 01:49:32.68
Is unveriant, comfortable for me, yes.

1562
01:49:32.68 --> 01:49:35.68
So, you know, cans seems more cool, but whatever, whatever you like.

1563
01:49:35.68 --> 01:49:39.68
Also, subscribe to this podcast, if you haven't already.

1564
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:41.68
Uh, on, you know, where are you listening to podcasts?

1565
01:49:41.68 --> 01:49:42.68
There it is.

1566
01:49:42.68 --> 01:49:44.68
I don't think we even need to say that anymore.

1567
01:49:44.68 --> 01:49:47.68
Okay, well, I've said that for like a year or maybe even three years

1568
01:49:47.68 --> 01:49:49.68
that we don't need to set a subscriber to the podcast.

1569
01:49:49.68 --> 01:49:52.68
But we do need to say subscribe to the Warrior Kid podcast.

1570
01:49:52.68 --> 01:49:53.68
Yeah.

1571
01:49:53.68 --> 01:49:54.68
Check it out.

1572
01:49:54.68 --> 01:49:55.68
Check it out.

1573
01:49:55.68 --> 01:49:59.68
Even if you aren't a kid, check it out.

1574
01:49:59.68 --> 01:50:02.68
I use a different voice in that podcast.

1575
01:50:02.68 --> 01:50:04.68
Dave Burke was talking about it.

1576
01:50:04.68 --> 01:50:05.68
Yep.

1577
01:50:05.68 --> 01:50:07.68
He's like, I even like that different.

1578
01:50:07.68 --> 01:50:09.68
I use this voice right here.

1579
01:50:09.68 --> 01:50:11.68
It's a little bit more aimed at kids.

1580
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:12.68
Yeah.

1581
01:50:12.68 --> 01:50:14.68
This is just the way I normally talk when I do.

1582
01:50:14.68 --> 01:50:16.68
Because I'm kind of Uncle Jake in that.

1583
01:50:16.68 --> 01:50:19.68
And Uncle Jake is a little bit more.

1584
01:50:19.68 --> 01:50:23.68
He's not he's well, not dorky, but he just doesn't have his little

1585
01:50:23.68 --> 01:50:24.68
little dark side.

1586
01:50:24.68 --> 01:50:25.68
Yeah.

1587
01:50:25.68 --> 01:50:26.68
Yeah.

1588
01:50:26.68 --> 01:50:28.68
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

1589
01:50:28.68 --> 01:50:29.68
The dark edge.

1590
01:50:29.68 --> 01:50:30.68
He's just good.

1591
01:50:30.68 --> 01:50:32.68
Like Uncle Jake is just good across the board.

1592
01:50:32.68 --> 01:50:33.68
Yeah.

1593
01:50:33.68 --> 01:50:34.68
You never know what I might have a little.

1594
01:50:34.68 --> 01:50:38.68
I might have a little issue with something and get kind of crazy on it.

1595
01:50:38.68 --> 01:50:39.68
Yeah.

1596
01:50:39.68 --> 01:50:40.68
Uncle Jake's not going to let that happen.

1597
01:50:40.68 --> 01:50:46.68
So check out the Warrior Kid podcast if you want to get some more information to your kids

1598
01:50:46.68 --> 01:50:49.68
about being on the path.

1599
01:50:49.68 --> 01:50:55.68
And you can hear me talk and tell stories in this voice from Uncle Jake.

1600
01:50:55.68 --> 01:50:56.68
Yeah.

1601
01:50:56.68 --> 01:51:01.68
Actually, something actually big exactly like how you sound on it was just good.

1602
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:03.68
And we're also yes, YouTube as well.

1603
01:51:03.68 --> 01:51:05.68
So we do have a YouTube channel if you didn't know that.

1604
01:51:05.68 --> 01:51:09.68
It does have the video version of this podcast and also little excerpts.

1605
01:51:09.68 --> 01:51:10.68
And enhanced excerpts.

1606
01:51:10.68 --> 01:51:13.68
By the way, I was noticing some of your recent excerpts.

1607
01:51:13.68 --> 01:51:16.68
You can't make excerpts that are 12 minutes long.

1608
01:51:16.68 --> 01:51:17.68
That's not an excerpts.

1609
01:51:17.68 --> 01:51:19.68
That's just like a video.

1610
01:51:19.68 --> 01:51:25.68
Well, technically that's not correct because an excerpt is just a part of time limit.

1611
01:51:25.68 --> 01:51:26.68
What do you think?

1612
01:51:26.68 --> 01:51:27.68
What do you think?

1613
01:51:27.68 --> 01:51:29.68
12 minutes is long, man.

1614
01:51:29.68 --> 01:51:30.68
I know.

1615
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:32.68
And sometimes I'm going to be 12 minutes.

1616
01:51:32.68 --> 01:51:35.68
There's no way that everything in that 12 minutes is important.

1617
01:51:35.68 --> 01:51:36.68
Kind.

1618
01:51:36.68 --> 01:51:37.68
Yeah.

1619
01:51:37.68 --> 01:51:38.68
That's true.

1620
01:51:38.68 --> 01:51:39.68
Get out of your editing scissors.

1621
01:51:39.68 --> 01:51:42.68
The pins on how you look at it though.

1622
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:45.68
Bro, these things are supposed to be an excerpt should be like, ah, you know what?

1623
01:51:45.68 --> 01:51:46.68
Boom.

1624
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:49.68
Two minutes and 28 seconds later, you're like, yeah, I got this.

1625
01:51:49.68 --> 01:51:50.68
Oh, I did it.

1626
01:51:50.68 --> 01:51:51.68
I agree.

1627
01:51:51.68 --> 01:51:52.68
But not a lot of times.

1628
01:51:52.68 --> 01:51:55.68
You want people to pull up and couch and peeven for a night.

1629
01:51:55.68 --> 01:51:56.68
Well, some of us watch this.

1630
01:51:56.68 --> 01:52:02.68
So, some of us are on the computer doing other stuff.

1631
01:52:02.68 --> 01:52:05.68
And then boom, there the excerpt comes up.

1632
01:52:05.68 --> 01:52:06.68
You know, about maybe a point.

1633
01:52:06.68 --> 01:52:10.68
Or maybe it's like, you say something in me disagreeing and then you say, well, this is this.

1634
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:12.68
And I'm saying, well, that's true, but what about this?

1635
01:52:12.68 --> 01:52:14.68
And you're like, okay, or whatever.

1636
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:17.68
You know, it's like a little, it's like a little conversation.

1637
01:52:17.68 --> 01:52:18.68
Yeah.

1638
01:52:18.68 --> 01:52:19.68
That's not too hours.

1639
01:52:19.68 --> 01:52:20.68
It's just saying.

1640
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:21.68
So, you know, it's presentable.

1641
01:52:21.68 --> 01:52:22.68
It's good.

1642
01:52:22.68 --> 01:52:23.68
Okay.

1643
01:52:23.68 --> 01:52:24.68
So, there's on the YouTube channel.

1644
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:26.68
There's long and short excerpts.

1645
01:52:26.68 --> 01:52:27.68
That's a good way to do it.

1646
01:52:27.68 --> 01:52:28.68
There's digestible.

1647
01:52:28.68 --> 01:52:33.68
And there's a little bit more like, you know, meal time.

1648
01:52:33.68 --> 01:52:40.68
Conversational, you know, because it's less about like the shortness and shareability.

1649
01:52:40.68 --> 01:52:43.68
That's necessarily it's more about like, hey, remember the shareability.

1650
01:52:43.68 --> 01:52:45.68
Oh, like, I can watch it.

1651
01:52:45.68 --> 01:52:46.68
Yeah.

1652
01:52:46.68 --> 01:52:47.68
It's like, okay.

1653
01:52:47.68 --> 01:52:50.68
It's like, yeah, they're more likely to watch the minute video than the 12 minute video.

1654
01:52:50.68 --> 01:52:58.68
But the 12 minutes, like, the kind of like, if you just want to hear about like this specific, like, topic that happened to take 12.

1655
01:52:58.68 --> 01:52:59.68
They're not all 12 minutes.

1656
01:52:59.68 --> 01:53:00.68
No, I'm like, one.

1657
01:53:00.68 --> 01:53:02.68
This may be like eight minutes though.

1658
01:53:02.68 --> 01:53:03.68
Maybe six.

1659
01:53:03.68 --> 01:53:04.68
Either way.

1660
01:53:04.68 --> 01:53:05.68
Yeah.

1661
01:53:05.68 --> 01:53:06.68
Psychological warfare too.

1662
01:53:06.68 --> 01:53:10.68
Speaking of little excerpts, those are just short.

1663
01:53:10.68 --> 01:53:11.68
Short.

1664
01:53:11.68 --> 01:53:16.68
One to two minutes of out of overcome some type of momentary weakness that you might have.

1665
01:53:16.68 --> 01:53:21.68
If you don't have a discipline equals freedom tattoo on your wrist, that's going to keep you in check.

1666
01:53:21.68 --> 01:53:25.68
This is another thing you can do prior to getting that tattoo.

1667
01:53:25.68 --> 01:53:31.68
You can just load up your psychological warfare on iTunes, Google Play and B3 platforms, whatever, and listen to those.

1668
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:36.68
Yes, which is, Jocco telling you how to overcome the weakness.

1669
01:53:36.68 --> 01:53:42.68
That is to that tattoo on your wrist, this little equals freedom is like the ultimate psychological warfare.

1670
01:53:42.68 --> 01:53:43.68
It is weapon.

1671
01:53:43.68 --> 01:53:44.68
It is weapon.

1672
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:45.68
Like, boom, discipline.

1673
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:48.68
Oh, what if you put discipline on one wrist and freedom on the other wrist?

1674
01:53:48.68 --> 01:53:50.68
I actually might do that.

1675
01:53:50.68 --> 01:53:51.68
That's pretty good.

1676
01:53:51.68 --> 01:53:52.68
That's pretty good.

1677
01:53:52.68 --> 01:53:53.68
That's pretty good.

1678
01:53:53.68 --> 01:54:03.68
At Origin, I've been talking to Pete, we're trying to buy a machine that can make sweat bands, wrist bands.

1679
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:04.68
Right.

1680
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:06.68
And then once we have that power, two things.

1681
01:54:06.68 --> 01:54:11.68
Number one, I'm going to make the best wrist bands because I will wrist bands every time I work out.

1682
01:54:11.68 --> 01:54:12.68
Yeah.

1683
01:54:12.68 --> 01:54:15.68
And, but there's no good wrist bands in the world.

1684
01:54:15.68 --> 01:54:18.68
There's none of them that meet the standards that I would like them to meet.

1685
01:54:18.68 --> 01:54:20.68
Why do you wear a wrist band?

1686
01:54:20.68 --> 01:54:21.68
Sweat primarily.

1687
01:54:21.68 --> 01:54:23.68
Oh, so it doesn't go on your wrist.

1688
01:54:23.68 --> 01:54:27.68
Because it's a little run right down my arms in my hands and I'm just dropping everything in its socks.

1689
01:54:27.68 --> 01:54:27.68
Yeah.

1690
01:54:27.68 --> 01:54:28.68
From here.

1691
01:54:28.68 --> 01:54:33.68
So, I'm going to make wrist bands that are super long.

1692
01:54:33.68 --> 01:54:35.68
Really, really.

1693
01:54:35.68 --> 01:54:41.68
Just, but I told Pete, we can put discipline on one and freedom on the other one.

1694
01:54:41.68 --> 01:54:42.68
Right.

1695
01:54:42.68 --> 01:54:43.68
And you can buy a little set.

1696
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:44.68
Yeah.

1697
01:54:44.68 --> 01:54:47.68
So, when you're just Pete's shopping for the machine right now.

1698
01:54:47.68 --> 01:54:48.68
Good.

1699
01:54:48.68 --> 01:54:49.68
Yeah.

1700
01:54:49.68 --> 01:54:50.68
Yes.

1701
01:54:50.68 --> 01:54:51.68
It can make socks.

1702
01:54:51.68 --> 01:54:52.68
Pete sent me a picture of a machine.

1703
01:54:52.68 --> 01:54:55.68
And he goes, what do you think this makes?

1704
01:54:55.68 --> 01:54:57.68
And I looked at it and I don't know.

1705
01:54:57.68 --> 01:55:04.68
I just kind of like logically it was sort of like a, you could see stuff 360 degrees around something else.

1706
01:55:04.68 --> 01:55:06.68
And I was like, I bet you, I said socks.

1707
01:55:06.68 --> 01:55:07.68
And he goes, day.

1708
01:55:07.68 --> 01:55:09.68
Oh, because I'm not eating it.

1709
01:55:09.68 --> 01:55:10.68
It's a good district.

1710
01:55:10.68 --> 01:55:11.68
Right.

1711
01:55:11.68 --> 01:55:12.68
But you can recognize it.

1712
01:55:12.68 --> 01:55:13.68
It was impressed with my logic.

1713
01:55:13.68 --> 01:55:14.68
Yeah.

1714
01:55:14.68 --> 01:55:17.68
You're dedu-sing deductive skills.

1715
01:55:17.68 --> 01:55:18.68
Yeah.

1716
01:55:18.68 --> 01:55:19.68
I'm scared.

1717
01:55:19.68 --> 01:55:20.68
I'm impressed too.

1718
01:55:20.68 --> 01:55:21.68
So you can be an impress.

1719
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:22.68

We got Mikey in the dragons, which is fully in stock.

1733
01:55:54.68 --> 01:55:55.68
Really?

1734
01:55:55.68 --> 01:55:56.68
Yeah.

1735
01:55:56.68 --> 01:55:57.68
It ran a little low.

1736
01:55:57.68 --> 01:55:59.68
We almost didn't make Christmas, but we made it.

1737
01:55:59.68 --> 01:56:00.68
Thank God.

1738
01:56:00.68 --> 01:56:01.68
Cool.

1739
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:07.68
Thanks to everyone on the team that helped us and all the printers around that printed us copies.

1740
01:56:07.68 --> 01:56:10.68
And we got a bunch of copies and everyone got them by Christmas.

1741
01:56:10.68 --> 01:56:11.68
That I know of.

1742

Everyone that's reached out on Twitter that said it's not here yet.

1743
01:56:13.68 --> 01:56:18.68
On December 19th or 13th was like, we still don't have it.

1744
01:56:18.68 --> 01:56:19.68
I ordered October.

1745
01:56:19.68 --> 01:56:21.68
I was like, it's coming to the police company.

1746
01:56:21.68 --> 01:56:28.68
And, uh, but as far as I know, everyone got them when they got them in time for Christmas.

Yeah.

1753
01:56:40.68 --> 01:56:41.68
I disagree with me.

1754
01:56:41.68 --> 01:56:42.68
No.

1755
01:56:42.68 --> 01:56:45.68
Well, I think just by nature, I'm like, we'll use it at claim.

1756
01:56:45.68 --> 01:56:46.68
Let me like refute it.

1757

Yeah.

I got pictures from John Bow's act today.

1787
01:57:30.68 --> 01:57:31.68
Vyatext.

1788
01:57:31.68 --> 01:57:32.68
You saw him right?

1789
01:57:32.68 --> 01:57:33.68
Witness.

1790
01:57:33.68 --> 01:57:33.68
Yeah.

1791
01:57:33.68 --> 01:57:34.68
How do you like him?

1792
01:57:34.68 --> 01:57:35.68
We like him a lot.

1793
01:57:35.68 --> 01:57:36.68
I showed.

1794
01:57:36.68 --> 01:57:37.68
I showed.

1795
01:57:37.68 --> 01:57:39.68
Danny Rinehart to my youngest daughter.

1796
01:57:39.68 --> 01:57:40.68
And I've been.

1797
01:57:40.68 --> 01:57:41.68
I've been.

1798
01:57:41.68 --> 01:57:45.68
I've been telling her about Danny Rinehart for a long time because Danny Rinehart does everything

1799
01:57:45.68 --> 01:57:49.68
perfect and Danny Rinehart does everything good and marks kind of jealous of him.

1800
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:53.68
And I sure and she was she's been she got all into the name.

1801
01:57:53.68 --> 01:57:54.68
Danny Rinehart.

1802
01:57:54.68 --> 01:57:55.68
Yeah.

1803
01:57:55.68 --> 01:57:56.68
She's an acquaintance.

1804
01:57:56.68 --> 01:57:57.68
Yeah.

1805
01:57:57.68 --> 01:57:58.68
She's already doesn't like him.

1806
01:57:58.68 --> 01:58:01.68
But the the interesting twist on the story is Danny Rinehart's actually a good kid.

1807
01:58:01.68 --> 01:58:02.68
Yeah.

1808
01:58:02.68 --> 01:58:07.68
And he just happens to be talented and he happens to work hard and he's actually nice.

1809
01:58:07.68 --> 01:58:09.68
But marks jealous.

1810
01:58:09.68 --> 01:58:14.68
So where you're kid three coming out in the spring and right now we got Warrior Kid

1811
01:58:14.68 --> 01:58:16.68
One and Warrior Kid do marks mission.

1812
01:58:16.68 --> 01:58:17.68
Also got this one.

1813
01:58:17.68 --> 01:58:20.68
He goes freedom field manual.

1814
01:58:20.68 --> 01:58:24.68
The manual for getting after it in life.

1815
01:58:24.68 --> 01:58:27.68
Super stoked on everyone that's posting pictures.

1816
01:58:27.68 --> 01:58:32.68
And I'm actually most stoked when somebody posts a picture that they've lost

1817
01:58:32.68 --> 01:58:40.68
160 to pounds in 14 months or whatever completely changed their lives.

1818
01:58:40.68 --> 01:58:41.68
Yeah.

1819
01:58:41.68 --> 01:58:42.68
Why discipline goes freedom?

1820
01:58:42.68 --> 01:58:46.68
So you can get that book for yourself.

1821
01:58:46.68 --> 01:58:49.68
That's also pre tattoo.

1822
01:58:49.68 --> 01:58:53.68
Maybe before you get tattoo you just leave this out on your coffee table.

1823
01:58:53.68 --> 01:58:54.68
Yeah.

1824
01:58:54.68 --> 01:58:56.68
You just have it there because it's looking at you.

1825
01:58:56.68 --> 01:58:57.68
That book is looking at you.

1826
01:58:57.68 --> 01:58:58.68
Yeah.

1827
01:58:58.68 --> 01:58:59.68
I got a stack of them in my room.

1828
01:58:59.68 --> 01:59:02.68
Oh yeah.

1829
01:59:02.68 --> 01:59:03.68
They keep you right on there.

1830
01:59:03.68 --> 01:59:06.68
So if you want the audio version it's on iTunes Amazon.

1831
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:09.68
Use a Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

1832
01:59:09.68 --> 01:59:10.68
Obviously extreme ownership.

1833
01:59:10.68 --> 01:59:16.68
The first book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin taking the lessons that we learned on the battlefield.

1834
01:59:16.68 --> 01:59:20.68
And explaining how they can be applied to your business and to your life.

1835
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:24.68
And that was the followed up that was followed up by the book that we just had come out

1836
01:59:24.68 --> 01:59:33.68
called the dichotomy of leadership and this is getting granular in how to apply those leadership principles into your world.

1837
01:59:33.68 --> 01:59:41.68
Also we have Escalon front, which is my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.

1838
01:59:41.68 --> 01:59:48.68
If you have any kind of problem in your organization, it is a leadership problem.

1839
01:59:48.68 --> 01:59:52.68
It is a leadership problem.

1840
01:59:52.68 --> 02:00:00.68
We will help get your leadership fixed, get them aligned, and get them working, and get the team functioning properly.

1841
02:00:00.68 --> 02:00:04.68
We also have a leadership conference that we do.

1842
02:00:04.68 --> 02:00:07.68
It's called the Master in 2019.

1843
02:00:07.68 --> 02:00:11.68
There are three masters, May 23rd and 24th in Chicago.

1844
02:00:11.68 --> 02:00:19.68
September 19th and 20th in Denver and December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.

1845
02:00:19.68 --> 02:00:25.68
Check out extremownership.com for the details and to register all of them that we have done have sold out.

1846
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:34.68
This is, and when I'm saying they sold out, this is when people call me up and say, or like, people that I know, say, hey, hey, I know in a little late,

1847
02:00:34.68 --> 02:00:39.68
just want to, can you just reserve three seats for me and these two other people that I work with?

1848
02:00:39.68 --> 02:00:44.68
And I'm like, actually, no, I can't. You cannot come.

1849
02:00:44.68 --> 02:00:52.68
Well, we'll just stand back. No, there's fire code to keep. Can't come. Everyone thinks you all just, you know, no, it's sold out.

1850
02:00:52.68 --> 02:01:00.68
So you can't come. The live podcasts we're doing, January 9th.

1851
02:01:00.68 --> 02:01:04.68
Sold out immediately. It's like, sorry.

1852
02:01:04.68 --> 02:01:07.68
Gotta be quick on those again.

1853
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:15.68
So there's that. Now we do have this. KF online. This is, this is the interactive training leadership training that we put together.

1854
02:01:15.68 --> 02:01:19.68
And, okay, so there's several places where this stemmed from.

1855
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:26.68
One of them is the master itself because guess what? The master is great foundational information.

1856
02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:33.68
It's a great foundational leadership instruction that you're going to get when you go.

1857
02:01:33.68 --> 02:01:41.68
Not even can make it to the master. So what we did is we took the content from the first, like, two monsters that we did.

1858
02:01:41.68 --> 02:01:45.68
And this is the fundamental principles from extreme ownership from the Academy leadership.

1859
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:56.68
We took those and put them into interactive online training so that people that couldn't make it to the master could still get that training.

1860
02:01:56.68 --> 02:02:05.68
We also did it because companies that we work with sometimes they have 10,000 employees, 20,000 employees, 100,000 employees.

1861
02:02:05.68 --> 02:02:11.68
And all the employees are not all in one place. They're all over the place. They're all over the country.

1862
02:02:11.68 --> 02:02:15.68
And they're all over the world. How are we going to train all those people?

1863
02:02:15.68 --> 02:02:19.68
What we needed to do is figure out a way to scale the training that we did.

1864
02:02:19.68 --> 02:02:27.68
There's many requests from the larger companies we work with to get the training to all their employees. How do we do that?

1865
02:02:27.68 --> 02:02:36.68
We had to scale it. So we put it online. And then once we put it online for companies, we figured, okay, let's get it out there for direct to consumers that want to take the training that can't come to the master.

1866
02:02:36.68 --> 02:02:41.68
What have you or they want to get reminded what they learned at the master. Same thing.

1867
02:02:41.68 --> 02:02:43.68
So that's online training.

1868
02:02:43.68 --> 02:02:56.68
To available now at eF online.com. Also, we've got EF Overwatch where we are taking leadership gaps in the civilian sector.

1869
02:02:56.68 --> 02:03:08.68
And we are filling those leadership gaps with trained and experienced and tested leaders from combat aviation and from the spec ops community.

1870
02:03:08.68 --> 02:03:19.68
Go to eF Overwatch.com, regardless of which side of that equation you're on, whether you're a company that needs leaders, whether you're a vet that's seeking a leadership position in a company.

1871
02:03:19.68 --> 02:03:26.68
Go to eF Overwatch.com and fill out the information that applies to you.

1872
02:03:26.68 --> 02:03:37.68
And if you want to continue this conversation with us, we can be found all up in the inner webs on Instagram, on Twitter and on the Facebook.

1873
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:53.68
Keep on. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and finally to all our military personnel out there. Thank you for protecting freedom around the world and to our folks in uniform here at home.

1874
02:03:53.68 --> 02:04:01.68
Police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, correction officers, board of patrol, all first responders.

1875
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:16.68
Thanks for protecting us and our families and to everyone else out there. Remember that discipline is stronger than fury.

1876
02:04:16.68 --> 02:04:23.68
You need a little bit of fury. You need a little bit of discipline. You need to combine those things.

1877
02:04:23.68 --> 02:04:36.68
But you take that discipline and you impose discipline upon yourself and reject and refuse delicate living and the luxuries that are available to you in life.

1878
02:04:36.68 --> 02:04:54.68
Instead get out of that comfort and make yourself better, faster, smarter and stronger by going out there day after day after day and getting after it.

1879
02:04:54.68 --> 02:05:07.68
Then until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
