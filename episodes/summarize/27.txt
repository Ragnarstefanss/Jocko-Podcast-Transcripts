And I'm assuming, I mean, given, you know, what I know about you guys is that that you're, you're pretty clear through what you say and what you do that you are supporting them and they are a part of you're like, you know, because some people, let's say, I don't know, just this is a hypothetical situation, but let's say a cop, right? Like that kind of thing where, you know, he kind of, in the back of his mind, he regards his family as something that should, I don't know, serve him while he does his, you know, real life in life, which is being amazing detected. And no one's going to be like 100% focused on that, you know, that situation or the, you know, you go, how you say, you said, I'm a Navy SEAL don't, you know, don't change me or whatever. I like if you're a fighter in the guy, you know, getting knocked out, seeing a guy you knocked out, you know, broken leg or something like that. And then going to the take down part of it, if you know the take down solid, even if you know like three or four really good ones and you're really good at them, that'll change your whole approach and your whole outlook on Judo. How, again, this is like nothing new, you know, but I feel like we're, a lot of us act like that that's simply not true. No, I mean, like, like, like, I was like, oh, I was typing on a computer. So if he just doesn't shell up all of a sudden, you know, I mean, you're, I'm assuming you're going to tell your wife, hey, I'm not going to, this is why, just like, are you saying, you're going to explain everything. But like if you know what life's voice sounds like, sounds like Batman. Yeah, that's a good one that I started to incorporate how you were saying, if I don't feel like it or if I feel like I'm starting to get burnt out, you'll, it's like that one last thing. And what doctors get is this sense of, okay, so not only the job, but it's almost like working on a car because you kind of know all the little working parts and you can fix them, use them together and boom, it works now, you know, kind of, so there's that element of thinking. but it can do it, you know, because it's like a, there might be a small gray area, you know, because they're like, oh, I don't really care that much about the outcome. So if even if I'm, if I don't feel like working out, I'll be like, you know, I'll go, I'll go and work out an easier work out, or I don't want to train GJT. We went out and hit our targets then we were driving back to our big base you know where we had good food and you know internet stuff like that. You know, that, obviously, like you say in that, I'm not going to be like, hey, I never realized that. I mean, you're still, it's like, it's not like you're going to get knocked out 100% of the time, probably not even 50% of the time. And so that for me, that's why I'm, I think that's kind of why I'm doing hard workouts because I'm doing hard workouts because I know that at the end of it, I'm going to be like, yeah, And as for you know, we're talking before the podcast started about how some people, if they're a little bit insecure, but they want to be a tough guy, they got to act like that. Because you have like people watch this TV, like if you, you know, can't remember lost. So it can't be substituted with, hey, you know, that you can't substitute your thinking in regards to this dead person with, you know, part of being part of my goal of my job, you know. And furthermore, I will tell you this, if you get to know the feeling of how you feel when you complete a hard workout, like you go, you know what? And unlike you, I feel like I feel like I don't know. I'm going to feel like a quality human being, like I didn't waste a little section of my life. But it's almost like most people, I don't say most people, but it's almost like people don't really understand that that's true. And so the point being, you know, how any mentions this, how it's like, oh, I'll just do it tomorrow or I'll just do it, you know, the New Year's resolution or whatever. It's like I don't know it's weird it happened so fast or something combined with the adrenaline you don't feel the destruction part of it you know. But I want to imagine it would really come to get you after everything comes down, like how he was saying he didn't even want to take a mouse out of the child dead mouse because it's a reminder in this calm environment, a reminder of just all that death, you know? And if I'll tell you and knowing some judo and especially knowing some judo moves that I feel like I'm pretty solid at, if you do it against the guy who doesn't really know that much judo, it's your choice whether you want to put him on his head or his back. And even if they know ultimately, they can't, they still for a day they might, you know, and it can go back, you know, so back and forth. And she was like, oh, I know, I know what you are. The camel back you know those those they're like thermuses they're like a 13. I mean, the people that are like this, these are people that are either have a big ego or maybe they know more than you. Like, um, you know, I don't know. Let's say you go into, I don't know, you know, party or everyday thing where you could find yourself in a situation where you got to get in a fight or defend yourself or your friend or whatever.
