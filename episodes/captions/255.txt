[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 255.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:09] And joining us again is Dave Burke.
[00:00:12] Good evening, Dave.
[00:00:13] Good evening.
[00:00:14] So we go on with guidelines for the leader and commander.
[00:00:21] And I think at this point, I'm not even sure that I'm just doing this purely out of my own joy.
[00:00:29] Having searched for this book for more than a decade, finally found a copy.
[00:00:35] And now I'm making everyone else enjoy it with me.
[00:00:41] We covered this book on 251, 252, 253, 254.
[00:00:47] But there's a reason.
[00:00:48] There's a reason to dig through the past two R roots, two My roots.
[00:00:56] The roots from this book, from a man that served in World War I, World War II, Korea, General
[00:01:01] Pruskark, Bruce Clark, who then overlap that service in Korea with Colonel David Hackworth
[00:01:07] who served in Korea and in Vietnam and who wrote the book about face.
[00:01:11] These are the lessons that I learned that I tried to pass on.
[00:01:16] And the DNA is so clear.
[00:01:19] It's so clear to read this book.
[00:01:25] And see that DNA to find the roots of knowledge and knowing it, we learn more.
[00:01:34] And that's the goal.
[00:01:36] The goal is to learn and improve and get better.
[00:01:40] So guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.
[00:01:46] Here we go.
[00:01:48] Back to the book.
[00:01:49] This next section, and I'll be honest with you.
[00:01:52] The last section, I liked it.
[00:01:54] There's some lessons that some takeaways for sure.
[00:01:58] This one I started getting.
[00:01:59] This one I had a good time with.
[00:02:03] And I was a little worried at first because the last section we were talking about was
[00:02:07] what's talking about training the individual soldier, which to me is like, okay, this
[00:02:11] what we're doing.
[00:02:12] We're talking about the individual soldier.
[00:02:13] I thought that might have been a little bit of a peak, a little bit of a peak where I started
[00:02:19] like this.
[00:02:20] But then I got to this section chapter 10, which is called training the unit.
[00:02:23] And I started saying, okay, which makes sense, right?
[00:02:28] Which makes sense.
[00:02:30] Because certainly there's going to be parallels.
[00:02:32] When you talk about training individual soldiers, but when you start talking about training
[00:02:35] teams and training units, this is where things really start to come to light from a leadership
[00:02:41] perspective.
[00:02:42] So important of unit training.
[00:02:45] The army's investment in the soldier pays off only when the unit is combat ready.
[00:02:50] So training develops combat ready units by welding skills, skilled individuals in the teams
[00:02:55] and combining teams into effective for tunes, companies and combined arms forces.
[00:03:01] It is my purpose in this chapter to highlight the application of principles and techniques
[00:03:05] that will contribute to improving a unit's combat readiness in less time at less cost, thus
[00:03:10] enabling the army to realize full measure from its investment in the soldier and as unit.
[00:03:17] So there you go.
[00:03:18] This is about training that team, getting them to work together.
[00:03:22] Theme of unit combat readiness.
[00:03:25] It has often been said that battles are fought by squads and platoons and one by teamwork
[00:03:31] of small units supported by fire.
[00:03:37] Combat power is inflicted on the enemy by fire and movement.
[00:03:41] There you go.
[00:03:42] Cover move.
[00:03:43] Welcome.
[00:03:44] It's been three paragraphs we're talking about.
[00:03:47] Cover move.
[00:03:48] This is why I started getting fired up.
[00:03:53] The purpose of movement is to get the fire in the most advantageous position to destroy
[00:03:59] the enemy.
[00:04:00] That's a good little thing to think about.
[00:04:03] That's why we cover and move.
[00:04:06] We cover and move to close with and destroy the enemy to get in an advantageous position to
[00:04:10] destroy the enemy.
[00:04:11] That's why we cover and move.
[00:04:12] One must remember however that gasoline, ammunition and other vital supplies are needed to
[00:04:16] sustain tactical operations.
[00:04:18] Accordingly, emphasis on small unit training should habitually stress teamwork to the
[00:04:23] point that tactical execution is accomplished with the same precision as dismounted drill
[00:04:28] that delivery of effective fire is as automatic as gun drill and that's supplied to the
[00:04:34] tactical unit is as responsive in battle as it is in Garrison.
[00:04:39] These battlefield reflections vividly point out the basic theme of small unit combat readiness.
[00:04:45] No small unit training should be undertaken in a vacuum.
[00:04:49] Why is he pointing this out?
[00:04:50] He's pointing this out because in the military it's very easy to silo yourself.
[00:04:56] It's very easy to say I want my platoon to be good so I'm going to go train my platoon.
[00:05:00] I want my company be good so I'm going to train my company.
[00:05:02] I want my battalion to be good so I'm just going to go train my battalion over here in
[00:05:05] a vacuum.
[00:05:07] If you're doing that you're wrong in any organization.
[00:05:11] If you're a sales person and you're not training alongside the operations people to make
[00:05:15] sure that you know how to communicate to them what you want and they know how to communicate
[00:05:21] to you what they can deliver.
[00:05:24] What about the IT group?
[00:05:25] Do they understand how to handle the threshold of emails that you're going to be getting?
[00:05:29] When you offer this new practice, all these things that need you need to work together.
[00:05:36] Sometimes it's because of internal competition as well.
[00:05:41] Wait that's why we wouldn't train together.
[00:05:43] Maybe or maybe but I think it's just like the straight up silos.
[00:05:51] You know what I'm saying?
[00:05:52] The straight up like hey this is my platoon I'm going to take care of my platoon.
[00:05:55] This is my division I'm going to take care of my platoon.
[00:05:56] This is my department I'm going to take care of my department.
[00:05:58] So like you're not thinking about necessarily the other guys or you're just like
[00:06:03] me and leave me alone.
[00:06:06] I think it could be either a real negative attitude but it could also be just a positive
[00:06:12] attitude that's like hey I'm going to train my platoon.
[00:06:14] That's what you're focused on.
[00:06:15] Yeah I'm going to train my platoon.
[00:06:16] Come here I'm going to train my platoon.
[00:06:18] We are going to be ready.
[00:06:20] Here's the problem you can be ready but if you can't call for fire correctly it doesn't
[00:06:23] matter if you've never coordinated with a QRF before it doesn't matter when that
[00:06:27] QRF is needed you don't know what you're doing.
[00:06:31] It happens in business too.
[00:06:33] Hey you know we're like I said we're the sales team.
[00:06:37] We don't care I'm not going to I don't need to train the the customer satisfaction group
[00:06:44] I don't need to train with them that's not my deal right.
[00:06:47] I don't care what happens when you know once I sell the product I don't care what happens
[00:06:51] oh really you should care what happens because if the client calls customer satisfaction
[00:06:57] it looks for a solution to a problem that they've got is they're implementing the thing
[00:07:00] that you just sold them and the solution isn't there guess what you're not getting good
[00:07:04] reviews and you're not going to sell anymore product to that company.
[00:07:08] Is the name customer satisfaction department is that it?
[00:07:12] Yeah yeah.
[00:07:13] Yeah we're sometimes they call it client implementation there's many many organizations
[00:07:17] that are set up in such a way that there's someone that sells the product and then there's
[00:07:20] someone that helps them implement the product and that's customer satisfaction.
[00:07:24] Could be customer satisfaction client satisfaction for some other names for a day if
[00:07:28] you can you think of any customer service tech support yeah stuff like that tech support
[00:07:32] that's a good one tech support you might think of like that's a broad based like hey I've
[00:07:37] had this computer for two years and now it's not working.
[00:07:41] What's all I'm talking about companies where you buy a new system of software for your
[00:07:47] organization like a solar panel.
[00:07:50] I guess home by a solar panel for your roof.
[00:07:55] Well let's say let's say you did that maybe you buy solar panels for your roof right
[00:08:00] and then great you're the salesman you sell them to me guess what you're done when you're
[00:08:04] done selling me my solar panels you're on trying to sell the next pair.
[00:08:07] So when I call because the installation I'm having a hard time with I call customer satisfaction
[00:08:13] it's Dave Dave picks up the phone hey I just ordered this thing and now he says well
[00:08:19] how many you know and I say look we're having trouble installing this it doesn't fit
[00:08:22] on my roof right and you say okay well how many panels did you get and what size are
[00:08:29] they and all of a sudden he realizes that he needs to give you feedback that listen if the
[00:08:35] roof is this angle fits a different way and so now you can sell the product better and
[00:08:41] that will keep people more satisfied you can also do a follow-up called me and say hey
[00:08:45] hey sir I'm really sorry when I measured your roof I thought it was this angle and so
[00:08:50] I I I told you this thing here's what we're gonna do we're actually to come out and pick
[00:08:53] up three of the panels that you're not gonna need anymore and I'm gonna you know I'm gonna
[00:08:57] give you a 10% rebate and we're also sending an installer out there to give you a hand
[00:09:02] and boom right now I'm taking care of we're all happy now we guess what I'm doing when somebody
[00:09:06] asked me oh you got solar panels what company and I say oh echoes solar panels is it a
[00:09:11] good company yeah you know it was a little rough but they got everything taken care of
[00:09:14] you should definitely call them you see what I'm going with us yeah fully in the
[00:09:18] world you just took me down the rabbit hole solar installation that was good
[00:09:23] maybe not the best example but you did good I'm over here to run with it yeah yeah
[00:09:27] yeah that's good we're here to make it happen what do you got but yeah because I
[00:09:30] you don't really think about that when you're at work you know where you kind of
[00:09:35] want to be the best worker in company sure you know but the customer like experience
[00:09:40] is kind of the whole deal you know you know how like man when you leave your review
[00:09:44] you're like great product bad customer service and that can be like well that sucks
[00:09:48] because I need some customer service kind of thing so it's kind of a downer you know
[00:09:51] yeah because we're not thinking everything's going to work perfect every single time right
[00:09:54] I'm not necessarily you seem to say but I'm saying like you know you have these elements
[00:09:58] of a product or service that are all to the customer it's like it's all the same thing
[00:10:05] I'm not going to go to this person just for one thing I'm going to go I mean as far as
[00:10:09] one quality of their product they're going to they'll get turned off by other
[00:10:14] departments so if you work there for your just focus on yours rather that affects you
[00:10:19] that's what general car is saying you have to interact with other people inside
[00:10:24] your organization and if you're not doing that you're wrong you're wrong fast forward a
[00:10:31] little training philosophy the basic the basic philosophy of successful training is
[00:10:34] that of obtaining superior results with average personnel god I love that
[00:10:41] with a reason or training is to take average people and make them exceptional superior results
[00:10:46] a unit to be truly outstanding should be excellent in all undertakings and activities
[00:10:52] commanders must know and understand that capabilities and limitations of personnel
[00:10:56] and set high and exacting standards of capabilities of the high ability of a group of
[00:11:02] units personnel this tends to give the low ability group a hopeless feeling because of
[00:11:08] having to compete against a standard which they cannot attain a unit satisfactory and all things
[00:11:14] is better than one outstanding in some excellent in others and unsatisfactory in a few
[00:11:23] that's a good thing to think about you know it's better to be good at a bunch I
[00:11:31] good at everything then outstanding at this one thing okay it's some other things in unsack
[00:11:36] in some final things
[00:11:41] next section fast forward a little bit emphasize fundamentals the basic difference between
[00:11:46] well trained unit and one that is not well trained is found in the attention paid to the
[00:11:50] fundamentals of marksmanship chemical biological and radiological warfare communications
[00:11:55] maintenance administration in all other arts and skills that contribute to making the unit
[00:11:59] combat ready in the shortest possible time a well trained soldier is the only foundation upon
[00:12:04] which effective combat ready units can be built when the soldier fails to demonstrate
[00:12:08] proficiency in individual skills the army's investment is wasted and the combat readiness of the
[00:12:14] unit is diminished each commander should approach his problems of combat readiness with a sense of
[00:12:21] wartime urgency there is no magic formula no sweatless solution to achieving a high state
[00:12:31] of combat readiness in a unit application the fundamentals enumerated below however will help
[00:12:36] so that by the way sweatless solution you've heard that before right that's that's that's hack
[00:12:42] well hack took that actual phrase and I was I had tried to find it in about face and of course
[00:12:49] that about faces 836 pages and I was like oh I know it's in here somewhere after I've
[00:12:53] I've done it on the podcast I've talked about the sweatless solution there is no sweatless solution
[00:12:58] we've covered that on the podcast you may have wondered where he got I was thought he made it up right
[00:13:02] of course we thought he made it up if you ever heard me say it maybe thought I made it up I didn't
[00:13:07] make it up neither do the hack there you go I believe the source is general clerk
[00:13:13] sweatless solution that's like that's that stuck with me for a long time still is with me really
[00:13:20] because sweat in part of it is yes because I had to admit to myself brother to me a lot of the time
[00:13:25] I'm looking for that sweatless this faith in the space I've been if you can go and get like
[00:13:31] you know the kind where okay the other day echo Charles going deep standby
[00:13:38] get some so I'm sitting on the couch right in big shocker there's a there's a so the remote control
[00:13:47] I have the kind where you know like the remote control for the cable and then for the volume
[00:13:51] they're two different okay so I got the one for the cable but I was like the volume one is
[00:13:59] like the volume one is somewhere else you know the kind you're looking around has to be close to you
[00:14:05] right because it's not like it's you know in the next room or something like that's not it
[00:14:08] doesn't have it's not gonna go far it's but it's around here somewhere right this is what we train for
[00:14:13] bro talking about this is a loose there so you know you kind of look around your little vicinity
[00:14:21] or whatever I'm not getting up though bro I'm already sitting down that might cause me to sweat a
[00:14:26] little bit but whatever so I'm looking around and I turn around and we have this ledge like behind
[00:14:31] the couch they're you know that ledge there and I look and it's behind me but it's the kind
[00:14:37] of incident this weird spot where I can't like I gotta stand up just if I want to stood up
[00:14:42] when I first saw it but I would have had the remote control enjoying some television at this
[00:14:46] point but I'm like trying to contort my body like all weird it was weird it was almost like I was
[00:14:51] putting more effort into my sweatless solution then actual energy would have been expanded if I went
[00:14:59] for the sweat solution the real one you know put it in just stand up for a second you know but I'm saying
[00:15:05] okay so the point the point the point the point is the point is bro I'm talking about hack or
[00:15:17] I'm talking about general Clark he served in World War World War 2 Korea and the
[00:15:21] current was a non-most decorated soldier you couldn't get your remote I could one I'm saying is
[00:15:30] sometimes we ask the people sometimes we put so much effort into looking for a sweatless solution
[00:15:38] okay seems like as a philosophy you know and how general Clark is saying subsequently hack
[00:15:45] worse subsequently Choco whether they're saying stop looking for the sweatless solution stop like straight up
[00:15:52] but just do the work stand up get through the remote control
[00:15:57] whatever this may be the apex of the echo Charles examples of just saying there's a lot of those
[00:16:06] you look like when you're vacuuming and you see the little thing it doesn't want to get sucked up by
[00:16:10] the vacuum just been no picking up you should and I don't want to do that so you're like
[00:16:15] kick it to try to get it loose you whatever I'm just saying these lessons are kind of everywhere
[00:16:21] when you think of it you don't say alright man general Clark would agree I mean I know he definitely
[00:16:29] would when he wasn't like on the line yeah of course fighting the Nazis yeah or fighting the
[00:16:36] communists yeah these guys didn't even have remote controls bro yeah excuse more counterice
[00:16:43] for I will be just trying to understand alright well there you go alright so back to the book
[00:16:51] he's talking about the things that you can you can do to keep a unit trained up number one
[00:16:55] do essential things first there's not enough time for the commander to do everything
[00:17:00] each commander will have to determine wisely what is essential and a sign response abilities for
[00:17:04] accomplishment he should spend the remaining time on near essentials this is especially true of
[00:17:09] training not essential should not take up required time required for essentials what do we call that
[00:17:15] we call that prioritize next year next thing do things right the first time
[00:17:23] the commander should not consider his unit ready for battle until it can carry out a plan well the first
[00:17:29] time to often commanders hold rehearsals of things their unit should be able to do well without
[00:17:34] rehearsal I like this because this is like a little bit you know there's this mantra in the
[00:17:40] games about you should do one foot one third planning one third gear prep one third rehearsal we
[00:17:46] put all this emphasis in the rehearsal which is awesome and I 100% believe that but you should
[00:17:51] there's things that you shouldn't have to rehearse right and that's what he said or something
[00:17:55] he just just know should have some some standard operating positions that you should know
[00:17:59] look are we gonna rehearse some yes we are but you should know you shouldn't need you should
[00:18:04] rehearse him you shouldn't have to rehearse but you should rehearse I rehearse everything
[00:18:11] this practice causes officers and men expecting a dry run or two to pay little attention to
[00:18:17] initial instructions and to make inadequate preparations there will be no dry runs in combat
[00:18:25] it is good to issue adequate instructions and hold officers and men to them the first time
[00:18:30] that's something that I wish I would have learned imagine saying hey look hey look I'm going to tell
[00:18:36] you guys this one time there we're going to go execute no rehearsals just to see just to just
[00:18:41] to get people in the mindset of paying attention and figuring out where your directions and your
[00:18:47] planning is a short fall because if I can't say okay Dave here's what we're going to do you're
[00:18:53] going to go in this building I'm going to go in this building you're going to take your squad
[00:18:56] you're going to move to here you're going to move to there does everyone understand all right we're
[00:18:58] going to go do it right now in this training exercise with no rehearsals that will show us the short
[00:19:06] falls of our planning and our communication it will also show the team short falls and when they
[00:19:13] don't know what to do they should raise their hand and say hey boss that doesn't make sense to me
[00:19:16] right now hold on a second let me hear that again I don't understand that part
[00:19:20] practice more than one thing at a time okay so wait a second are we going against prioritize
[00:19:31] next cue does that what's happening no actually whenever I see a unit practicing only one thing
[00:19:35] at a time I'd remember of the history paper my son brought home one day the grammar construction
[00:19:40] and spelling were not good this is very poor English I told him but daddy said I was only being tested
[00:19:46] in history sound training requires that many subjects be skillfully integrated and taught
[00:19:52] concurrently this is an excellent time saver in training and he goes through this and any what he's
[00:20:00] saying is look you gotta do multiple things at the same time and even though prioritize an
[00:20:04] execute when you got multiple problems and you can't try and solve them all at the same time that
[00:20:09] doesn't mean that you're gonna say hold on a second we need to move towards the target but we also
[00:20:17] need to make communications we can only do one at a time no there's things that you have to do concurrently
[00:20:24] and that can include hey we've got to move wounded people and we've got to fight a firefight if we
[00:20:30] only ever practice just getting in a firefight and just moving people how do we know how to do
[00:20:36] both those things at the same time which you may have to do so do you have to prioritize next
[00:20:41] you yes you do but guess what you also have to learn how to do things concurrently
[00:20:49] he says a paper integration and training schedule is not efficient so just like talking about
[00:20:54] it well you know if we have to do move a wounded guy while we're in a firefight well then
[00:21:00] we'll just do this xyz no you have to try it which is contradictory to rehearsals right
[00:21:06] no don't don't don't do rehearsals yes do rehearsals a commander should take every opportunity to
[00:21:14] exploit the effects of integrated training it is the key to accelerate intensified unit combat
[00:21:18] training in effect it increases the amount of available training time good eliminate the habit
[00:21:24] eliminate the administrative habit in training I'm convinced that all commanders should take maximum
[00:21:29] advantage of field training time to develop correct tactical practices and procedures we talked
[00:21:35] about that one last time practice dispersion concealment and can of camouflage the penalty for bad
[00:21:41] habits and passive measures in air defense or warrants special mentioned the day when American
[00:21:47] soldier could be relaxed about dispersion concealment and camouflage is in the past so how does this
[00:21:55] apply to everyday life and business train how you fight train how you fight know the status of
[00:22:03] men and equipment check up on those that are absentee from training practice maintenance in the field
[00:22:12] practice and he's got little sections about these each one of these practice sound troop leading
[00:22:17] procedures the subject of troop leading procedures and allied techniques requires increased emphasis
[00:22:23] on tactical exercises fundamentals found in field manuals and related publications are worthy of stress
[00:22:29] sound command procedures diligently practiced in all field training will form good habits in the unit
[00:22:35] commander form the checklist habit meticulous planning and reconnaissance are required to make sure
[00:22:45] that every minute in the field will be expanded profitably check this for this purpose are
[00:22:50] necessary command and staff tool just as they are for supervising and testing the conduct of training
[00:22:56] what do you got I got the same thing I keep thinking about every time I hear what he has to say he he keeps
[00:23:02] repeating fundamental sound realistic fundamentals these are the fundamental to the basic things all
[00:23:10] the basic things associated with their job and being good at those things and training in a real
[00:23:17] asexinereo there's a lot obviously general carcass talking about war he's recounting his experiences
[00:23:27] war I hear what he's saying is connecting it to war but the the application of these things as I keep
[00:23:34] hearing it in my head hearing what you're saying and thinking about the things I'm thinking about now
[00:23:38] if you are in the private sector anywhere the private sector unless you happen to be
[00:23:44] in one of the rare sectors that's not competitive and there are almost none if you are in the
[00:23:51] if you are in the American capitalist private sector you are at war your competitors
[00:23:59] don't want to share space with you they don't want to cooperate with you to to work in harmony
[00:24:04] to they want to run you over they want to take all of your clients all of your market share
[00:24:09] and all of your product they want to take all that from you and the way you are successful is the
[00:24:14] exact same things your people have to be trained on the fundamentals and everything that applies to
[00:24:19] them and the only way to do that is to find a way to train them realistically that replicates what
[00:24:24] they're going to deal with in the real war in their real world it's just kind of crazy how
[00:24:31] while it seems difficult to make the connection to his world the connection is so straightforward
[00:24:37] to any world that you're operating in you know I've broached this subject before and I'm sure
[00:24:43] there's got to be some kind of scientific or psychological experiment or whatever but the
[00:24:55] the improvement of your response from a time when you don't know what's going to happen and you
[00:25:05] haven't practiced it to a time when you do know what's going to happen you have practiced it
[00:25:09] is exponential is absolutely exponential and we see this all the time and that's not
[00:25:14] front when we roll play with people totally we put up someone in a role playing scenario
[00:25:18] and and they say we know I've got to go talk to this I'm going to talk to my subordinate leader who's
[00:25:22] got a giant ego and okay roll in there and just talk to him see how that goes it's going to be a
[00:25:29] disaster so you roll play and guess what the first time you roll play it's a disaster the second time
[00:25:34] it's 10 times better yeah and then the third time it's 15 times better and then the fourth time
[00:25:39] it's 17 times better but that first look that first look that you get when you know a little bit of
[00:25:46] what to expect man you are just you're you're exponentially more prepared for that situation
[00:25:54] and and we know when you're in a leadership position you're going to roll into a meeting where you've
[00:25:59] got to deliver some bad news to the troops you know what they're going to say you know there's
[00:26:04] eight responses you're going to get why not think through those things why not think through those things
[00:26:10] you're going to talk to a client that you've disappointed you've let down you've made a mistake
[00:26:13] you know they're going to have one of six different reactions why not work through those why not
[00:26:20] have a contingency plan for each one of those six things this will take you four minutes to do
[00:26:25] it'll take you and I four minutes to roll play may it'll take us five ten minutes to roll play
[00:26:30] the six different responses when I roll into you and I say hey Dave listen I know we promised you
[00:26:35] this product on this date we ran into some hiccups here's the mistakes that I made here's what
[00:26:41] we're going to try and do to resolve it you're only going to be able to say so many different
[00:26:45] things back to me and and depending on how I respond I could either salvage that relationship or
[00:26:50] I could destroy it so why would we not train to be prepared for this there's no reason there's no
[00:26:56] excuse for it it doesn't take a week to train for that situation takes ten minutes it does it takes
[00:27:02] ten minutes if your own brain is the only place where you consider the potential outcomes of that
[00:27:09] conversation you're going to miss so many things if I get one other person sit across for me
[00:27:15] to answer in any way that they want how I'm going to interact with them I actually now a reveal
[00:27:23] the well I didn't expect that I didn't see that coming I don't know what to say here
[00:27:27] and you also have to have the other person to just interact with you in a way that helps you anticipate
[00:27:33] a real response that you won't consider if you do it in your own brain which is a vacuum
[00:27:39] because what you can convince yourself is oh this isn't going to be that hard of a conversation I'm
[00:27:43] just going to say this he's going to say that and everything's going to be fine the role play
[00:27:47] winners we do to just to add one more thing to that when we do role play it usually comes right
[00:27:54] after we've done the initial training where we explain it he's and he talked about this that is
[00:28:00] that is paper training hey this is what we're going to do and it makes sense we think we understand
[00:28:05] it in our heads it resonates and we can explain these principles and we say okay let's roll
[00:28:10] model this the first role role play the first role play is always a disaster even when we just talked
[00:28:17] about it because on paper isn't enough it's not enough and three role plays later five minutes
[00:28:26] later they've gone from here to way up here and then they can actually go have that conversation
[00:28:31] in real life in real time with the real person that need to talk to you that five minutes of live
[00:28:36] realistic fundamental training is the difference this brings up another topic so I said hey look this
[00:28:45] this individual is only got to have six different responses right there's a seventh and the seventh
[00:28:51] is one that you didn't predict you didn't understand and you didn't think could come and guess what you can
[00:28:57] actually train your response for the thing that you just came that came completely out of left
[00:29:01] field and it might be as simple as when Dave if Dave says something to me that I had no anticipation
[00:29:08] and it doesn't make any sense to me what am I going to do you know what I'm going to do?
[00:29:12] I'm going to say if Dave says to me well I'll tell you what not only do we want our money back
[00:29:17] I want to I want to take you guys to court I didn't expect him to say that our relationship was not
[00:29:22] bad and I you know my response to him if I don't know what else to say I'm going to say
[00:29:30] Dave you know what I need to think about this for a minute let me just think about what you're saying
[00:29:35] because I want to make sure I understand that right there that right there is a response and it
[00:29:40] and if I'm prepared for it you know here's a funny one when it used to be back in the day and the
[00:29:45] deems when you would go to get your seal tried it you had it you should you got done with
[00:29:52] buds you went to a team you went through more training and then you were on probation for six
[00:29:56] months and then you had to go do an oral board for all the different departments and you had to go
[00:30:02] and program the radios and break down the weapons and build demolition charges and you know show
[00:30:08] how to put on a parachute rig and set up a diary you had to do all these different things
[00:30:11] and answer all these questions and one of the things that you learned was or you better have learned
[00:30:17] was when someone asked you a question that you don't know you better have a response for and the
[00:30:23] response is you know master chief I'm not exactly sure of the answer to that question but I know
[00:30:28] that it is in the dive manual that I can find down in the dive locker that's great that's
[00:30:33] that's a that's a response that the master chief says all right fair enough we'll go you better get
[00:30:38] you better start learning a little bit deeper but if you go oh oh oh is it 30 feet for 30 minutes
[00:30:47] no it's not 30 feet for 30 minutes you try and BS the master chief and you're going to end up
[00:30:53] getting your ass kicked so what you do is you and we did this we roleplayed the the oral board
[00:31:01] me and my friends that had showed up at sealed team one and we'd gone through this training
[00:31:04] and now we were getting ready for that all but we we crushed each other in those oral boards
[00:31:09] and one of the things that we figured out was which we got you know some of the senior guys said
[00:31:13] hey listen if you don't know the answer it's okay here's the response but rehearsing that and
[00:31:18] being ready for it is infinitely better than no rehearsal going there blind and get get smacked
[00:31:26] upside the head with something you didn't expect that you will talk yourself into that you've
[00:31:31] got to cover if you're doing this alone you'll tell yourself this isn't gonna be that hard I
[00:31:35] got this covered and you go in there solo you're gonna get crushed because you just you don't
[00:31:40] have that other person that to put you in a spot and go wow hang on a second training is important yes
[00:31:49] he breaks down here organization for unit training training plans
[00:31:54] comprehensible and workable plans are indispensable and should be formulated with consideration of the
[00:31:59] falling for essentials established training goals that's number one number two continuous evaluation
[00:32:07] this process must go on throughout the training cycle and as an integral part of it
[00:32:14] only by continuous evaluation can deficiencies be discovered early enough to make immediate
[00:32:19] correction possible number three testing closely related to evaluation is the more formal testing
[00:32:26] that is given to an individual or unit at the conclusion of a phase of training or block of
[00:32:30] instruction it's here that we determine whether our training goals have been met number four
[00:32:35] remedial training I must emphasize here the value of remedial or makeup training once event once a
[00:32:42] valuation in testing have identified the areas of deficiency remedial training must be used to correct them
[00:32:48] it should be an integral part of every training schedule of course the instruction will be designed to
[00:32:53] overcome specific weaknesses that have been exposed by the testing program and will have
[00:32:58] to be keyed to the specific needs of your unit it is essential however that remedial training
[00:33:03] be regularly scheduled gosh that makes sense so those are the four things established training goals
[00:33:10] continuous evaluation testing and remedial training what would that was their tests whether tests
[00:33:18] at each phase of top gun as you are going through the training yeah absolutely what was an example of
[00:33:25] a test the most common test that we give is that we'd want to make sure the students understood
[00:33:30] the mechanics of a system so how a missile system worked how the targeting system worked how the
[00:33:35] radar system worked you out we wanted to make sure they understood the mechanics of it
[00:33:39] before they use it in practical terms it probably isn't too much different than your experience
[00:33:45] of understanding how the radios worked before you were using them in the field right you have
[00:33:49] to understand hf propagation yeah you did you have to understand the i honest fear you you
[00:33:55] absolutely did because what happened is you're going to find yourself in a position and this is
[00:33:59] me I don't know I wasn't that position is if you're in a particular geography particular place
[00:34:04] and talking to a particular other person some radios going to work better than other radios
[00:34:09] this is true you might need to know hey you know what we're like in the bushes here in the
[00:34:13] in the wilderness so in the jungle this radio doesn't work here doesn't penetrate through this
[00:34:17] this thing so there's a million different examples of that if you get that out of order and you
[00:34:22] just work you you learn how to maneuver the system like my my my cursor moves at the here I
[00:34:27] move my my cursor on the display here and you don't actually know what's happening to the mechanics
[00:34:31] behind that you're going to start making mistakes inside in specific settings oh it work here
[00:34:38] so much work everywhere like no it doesn't work everywhere this environment is optimized here
[00:34:42] this environment it doesn't work at all and if all you know is the mechanics and not what's
[00:34:45] happening behind it you actually can't apply it when it matters the most you know what that made me
[00:34:50] think of the book Leadership Strategy and Tactics by me because it's I say an exact same thing
[00:34:57] but when I'm talking I compare I compare a leader to a woodworker and talk about the fact
[00:35:03] that you know when you're a leader you got to know the different tools but then you got a
[00:35:08] if you're a woodworker you've got to know the different tools and then you've got to know the
[00:35:11] different types of wood and then you've got to know how to apply those different types
[00:35:14] those different tools to different types of wood and then you've got to realize that even
[00:35:17] each individual piece of wood, a piece of pine is super soft,
[00:35:21] a piece of oak is super hard.
[00:35:22] You gotta use those tools differently
[00:35:24] with those different types of wood,
[00:35:26] and then on top of that,
[00:35:28] each individual piece of pine is different.
[00:35:31] It has a not, it has a rift, it has a cut,
[00:35:34] it has a split, and you gotta know how to deal with that.
[00:35:37] So you gotta understand the principles of the tools.
[00:35:42] I may regularly plagiarize the hell at that book,
[00:35:45] but I don't know where to go.
[00:35:46] Check.
[00:35:49] Talks about assignment of administrative tasks.
[00:35:51] He talks about when a unit is under strength.
[00:35:54] Reduce strengths must be offset
[00:35:57] by more efficient utilization of men and women.
[00:35:59] Now, you know, I gotta ask this question today,
[00:36:00] we've buy a client.
[00:36:01] Yeah, but we don't, we don't, we don't,
[00:36:03] we need more people.
[00:36:04] Guess what, everybody, everybody needs more people.
[00:36:08] We got visited by a senior ranking officer
[00:36:12] in the Seal Teams, what are we in the Rmadi?
[00:36:14] And at Lafelite's tell the story,
[00:36:16] the, you know, great, great officer, huge supporter,
[00:36:20] says, hey, what else do you need out here?
[00:36:23] Is there anything else you need?
[00:36:24] And I said, I need two more tasks units worth of men.
[00:36:27] You know, like we had enough missions to get everybody busy.
[00:36:32] But guess what, we didn't get anybody.
[00:36:33] We didn't, you know, like that's the way it works.
[00:36:37] Next little section in Jack Realism.
[00:36:40] The experienced commander knows that soldiers do
[00:36:44] and combat exactly what they have been taught
[00:36:46] and have practiced in training.
[00:36:47] Therefore, each training situation and problem
[00:36:50] must be as valid and realistic as possible
[00:36:52] with unreal or artificial aspects eliminated.
[00:36:56] Training must reflect as many of the conditions,
[00:36:59] scenes, noises and situations of the battlefield
[00:37:02] as ingenuity can conceive and safety rules will permit.
[00:37:07] And I remember, I remember I put on, we'd be doing,
[00:37:13] when I got back from my last plan,
[00:37:15] when we got back from Madi and I took over training,
[00:37:18] a few months into that, when you would put on your nods
[00:37:21] at night, you would, you might as well be in Iraq.
[00:37:24] You might as well have been in Iraq.
[00:37:26] We had, we had the, the speakers playing gun battles
[00:37:30] and called a prayer.
[00:37:31] We had tires burning.
[00:37:33] We had people dressed up like, you know, local Iraq.
[00:37:36] He said, it's in walking around.
[00:37:38] It was freaking awesome.
[00:37:40] It was freaking awesome.
[00:37:42] That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:37:46] Damn, I remember that.
[00:37:47] The first time we were rolling into the Moulab
[00:37:49] and it was early in the morning.
[00:37:51] It was, it was actually when the blue on blue happened
[00:37:54] in extreme ownership, but we were rolling in there.
[00:37:58] I remember rolling in like there's tires burning in the streets
[00:38:01] and yeah, I was like, okay,
[00:38:04] because what does that do that screws up your nods?
[00:38:06] And luckily the sun was coming up,
[00:38:08] but it was still dark outside,
[00:38:09] but I'm thinking these, these Mujahideen fighters,
[00:38:12] know what they're doing.
[00:38:13] These guys know what they're doing.
[00:38:15] They're, and then guess what?
[00:38:16] So it messes up your night vision,
[00:38:18] we understand that these burning fires
[00:38:19] and then the sun comes up.
[00:38:21] Well now there's just black, smoke everywhere.
[00:38:27] And you can gear and damn,
[00:38:29] to you that when I got back and I was running training,
[00:38:33] you rolled out of the street.
[00:38:34] We're burning tires.
[00:38:35] Your night vision is gonna be all jacked up
[00:38:37] and when you're done with the night vision being all jacked up
[00:38:39] and the sun comes up, guess what?
[00:38:41] It's gonna be black smoke everywhere.
[00:38:44] One of the best ways to emphasize realism
[00:38:47] is to assess personnel casualties
[00:38:50] for improper use of cover, or in the case of night exercise
[00:38:53] as vehicles can be knocked out for on off,
[00:38:55] rise to use of nights.
[00:38:56] What does that mean you're putting people down?
[00:38:58] This is like trade-et instructions.
[00:39:00] I might as well have written this for trade-et to use.
[00:39:04] This is exactly what we did.
[00:39:06] Oh, you're not saying to my cover, cool, you're dead.
[00:39:09] Oh, you're gonna move out, cross an open street
[00:39:11] without any cover fire, Roger that, you're dead,
[00:39:12] you're down, man.
[00:39:13] Now let's get this thing figured out.
[00:39:15] Oh, by the way, your buddy wants to come help you immediately
[00:39:17] without putting down suppressor fire, cool, he's dead too.
[00:39:19] Let's rock and roll, who wants to figure this out?
[00:39:21] Who wants to put the cover in cover, move?
[00:39:24] Dude, you're literally like,
[00:39:26] I wrote that thing down fundamental sound and realistic.
[00:39:28] Oh, cool, you're not applying the fundamentals?
[00:39:29] Good, you're dead.
[00:39:30] Oh, your tactics aren't sound?
[00:39:32] Cool, he's gone.
[00:39:32] Now what are you gonna do?
[00:39:33] I mean, I should have a track,
[00:39:35] or I should literally just be marking how many times he and you
[00:39:38] were referring back to the realism that's required.
[00:39:41] And the beauty of that, especially when you have experiences,
[00:39:44] it completely takes away the ammunition of,
[00:39:47] this would never happen.
[00:39:48] Or this is unrealistic, you know,
[00:39:50] them the, the, the, the, the unwindable scenarios,
[00:39:53] we go, well, this would never happen.
[00:39:54] Oh, really?
[00:39:55] Oh, cool, this would never happen.
[00:39:56] Watch this.
[00:39:57] Yeah.
[00:39:58] And the easier the training is,
[00:40:00] the more acclimated people get to things being easy.
[00:40:04] And the more unwilling they are to believe how difficult
[00:40:06] they can be.
[00:40:08] And when you're training is realistic,
[00:40:09] how many times have you told me
[00:40:10] and everybody the story of Seth's first firefighter,
[00:40:13] and the guys like, wow, how many firefighters have you been in?
[00:40:18] You must be, and he's like,
[00:40:20] it was my first one.
[00:40:21] That was my first one.
[00:40:22] That comes from fundamental sound, realistic training.
[00:40:24] Yeah. And putting that guy in position,
[00:40:26] I might not be in a, I don't know what this is.
[00:40:27] I can't recreate this scenario.
[00:40:28] I don't know exactly how it's gonna play out,
[00:40:30] but I do know what it's gonna be.
[00:40:32] I do understand how this is gonna reveal itself.
[00:40:34] And the only way to prepare for that is
[00:40:36] fundamental sound, realistic training,
[00:40:37] over and over and over again.
[00:40:43] Emphasis on night training.
[00:40:45] Self-sufficiency and confidence,
[00:40:47] our key factors in developing a unit's capability
[00:40:50] for night operations.
[00:40:51] And this was just, you know,
[00:40:53] not gonna spend a bunch of time on this because now
[00:40:55] we've got night vision, but what is more important?
[00:40:58] What do we talk about?
[00:40:59] Talk about night vision versus night night vision.
[00:41:01] What I'm talking about is, put your troops
[00:41:04] into hard training situations.
[00:41:06] That's what you need to do.
[00:41:08] Put your troops into the most difficult of situations
[00:41:11] because when you're used to fighting at night,
[00:41:12] even a pretty night vision,
[00:41:14] if you're used to fighting at night,
[00:41:16] number one, yes, you get used to it.
[00:41:17] Number two, fighting at the day becomes easy.
[00:41:21] It makes fighting at the day become easy.
[00:41:24] And it also gives you a potential advantage.
[00:41:26] If it just so happens that your competition
[00:41:28] isn't willing to put in the hard training at night,
[00:41:32] good, you're gonna dominate.
[00:41:35] It's the same thing here,
[00:41:36] Incoming weather training.
[00:41:38] I gotta read this one though, because it's funny.
[00:41:40] Adverse weather will inevitably be encountered
[00:41:43] and combat and will give rise to problems
[00:41:45] that can best be solved by experience.
[00:41:47] It will have an impact on a mobility,
[00:41:48] on maintenance of vehicle and equipment,
[00:41:50] on observation on the availability of tactical air support
[00:41:53] and in fact will hinder tactical operations
[00:41:55] in every conceivable way.
[00:41:57] Adverse weather conditions can be turned into
[00:41:59] an asset during battle, however.
[00:42:01] Boom, there you go.
[00:42:02] So we're already, look, bad weather, good.
[00:42:06] Commanders should take every advantage
[00:42:08] of training under such conditions.
[00:42:10] Troops who have mastered the problems
[00:42:12] of operating effectively in spite of the weather
[00:42:14] can turn low visibility, extreme height,
[00:42:17] biting cold or heavy rain into tactical advantage
[00:42:21] against an enemy not so well adapted
[00:42:23] to these adverse conditions.
[00:42:25] So that's everything you just said, and it's this,
[00:42:28] the solution of rainy day schedule is to put on the raincoat
[00:42:32] and take full advantage the adverse conditions
[00:42:34] for profitable field training and experience.
[00:42:38] Totally legit.
[00:42:39] You know what's fun in the in the teams?
[00:42:44] When there's giant waves like when a massive storm comes
[00:42:50] and there's massive just destroyer waves,
[00:42:54] it's like time to go out and do surf passage
[00:42:56] with the zodiacs and just get annihilated.
[00:42:58] It's so fun.
[00:43:00] I think that with bud students, oh, it's below.
[00:43:02] The waves are freaking just giant cool.
[00:43:03] Get your boats, you're going to do surf passage
[00:43:05] or sometimes get to get your swim in the teams.
[00:43:08] It was a hey, rig up the zodiacs.
[00:43:09] We're going to go get some experience and this stuff.
[00:43:11] That's which absolutely you have to do.
[00:43:13] If you're in the teams and there's big waves
[00:43:15] in Coronado or Virginia Beach
[00:43:18] and you're not getting shocked up to go get some,
[00:43:21] you're wrong, get your platoon together
[00:43:23] and get them out there and get them after it.
[00:43:27] Cross training for flexibility,
[00:43:28] cross training is vital to any organization.
[00:43:30] When your personnel are trained in several jobs,
[00:43:32] you have achieved depth and capability
[00:43:34] that may well split the difference
[00:43:36] between success and failure and combat.
[00:43:40] Of course, needless switching of personnel
[00:43:43] from one job to another is harmful.
[00:43:45] So cross train, but that doesn't mean you switch them
[00:43:47] completely.
[00:43:47] Training personnel and duties other than their primary
[00:43:50] MLS, however, will increase your peace time efficiency
[00:43:52] and subsequent combat effectiveness.
[00:43:54] It will also make the individual a more valuable asset
[00:43:57] to the Army increases pride in self confidence
[00:44:00] and may well help them qualify for promotion.
[00:44:02] But a little time spent cross training
[00:44:05] will be amply rewarded in the increased overall
[00:44:09] effectiveness of your unit.
[00:44:10] Everyone will benefit.
[00:44:12] Not the least of you is the commander.
[00:44:13] He's throw his that in there.
[00:44:14] Everyone's so nice.
[00:44:15] Got a little eat.
[00:44:15] Let's look south.
[00:44:17] Everyone's in the wild.
[00:44:19] We hear it.
[00:44:20] Got to be something driving this guy to do 45 years
[00:44:22] in the Army I reckon.
[00:44:24] But he likes that.
[00:44:26] Take care of the troops.
[00:44:27] Also, a little Benny.
[00:44:29] A little side Benny for the man.
[00:44:34] Chaining, chain of command, a good organization always has
[00:44:37] a smoothly functioning chain of command,
[00:44:39] a sound training program properly supervised
[00:44:41] can be the primary means of developing
[00:44:43] the proper functioning of the chain of command,
[00:44:46] which is also essential.
[00:44:46] And combat, a good commander will guide the development
[00:44:49] of his unit to ensure that subordinate
[00:44:50] commanders retain and use their authority and responsibility
[00:44:54] in any unit.
[00:44:55] The non-commissioner officer plays a leading role.
[00:44:57] That's your front line managers.
[00:44:59] He must be carefully instructed given responsibility
[00:45:01] in the held accountable.
[00:45:03] I frequently find squad beaters,
[00:45:05] ignoring their team leaders by issuing orders,
[00:45:09] giving fire commands and taking other actions
[00:45:11] directly with the individual members of the squad.
[00:45:14] Even worse, I found responsible officers
[00:45:16] who were condoning these mistakes.
[00:45:19] The squad leaders should use his team leaders
[00:45:21] to exercise control over the squad at all times.
[00:45:25] Commanders should supervise a soul battle drill
[00:45:28] and squad exercise to ensure that squad leaders
[00:45:30] understand and apply the principle of exercising command
[00:45:34] over the rifle squad through designated team leaders.
[00:45:37] So don't throw the chain of command.
[00:45:38] Let your subordinate leaders lead.
[00:45:43] Self-sufficiency and confidence confidence
[00:45:45] to fight semi-independently under conditions
[00:45:48] of decentralized control is developed by training exercises.
[00:45:53] Current concepts of warfare,
[00:45:55] visualizing greater dispersion on the battlefield.
[00:45:57] So we're more spread out, dictate the necessity
[00:45:59] for units to acquire self-confidence and self-sufficiency.
[00:46:03] These aspects can be developed in most tactical exercises
[00:46:06] and can be furthered through realistic use
[00:46:08] of active aggressor forces.
[00:46:14] Force on force training.
[00:46:16] That's what we want to do.
[00:46:18] Ranger type operations also instill confidence
[00:46:21] and show the need for self-sufficiency.
[00:46:24] When out of physical contact with friendly forces
[00:46:28] or beyond the range of mutual fire support,
[00:46:31] so we're not covering and moving anymore,
[00:46:33] the isolated unit becomes a problem.
[00:46:37] And our training commander should recognize
[00:46:39] the plight of the isolated unit,
[00:46:41] not by simulating it,
[00:46:43] but by actually demonstrating it.
[00:46:45] When the small unit is confronted
[00:46:47] with an isolated mission, confidence can always be instilled
[00:46:50] by ensuring that procedures are established
[00:46:52] for maintaining communications and for rallying
[00:46:54] to its support if required.
[00:46:57] Training should be aimed at developing integrated procedures
[00:47:01] for the employment of Army aviation
[00:47:03] and Air Force troop carrier troop movements
[00:47:05] for resupply and medical evacuation.
[00:47:07] So we have to learn to work independently,
[00:47:11] but we always have to be able to support each other.
[00:47:15] We're alone out on the battlefield, we die.
[00:47:17] You mean there's a balance there?
[00:47:18] There's a balance.
[00:47:19] There is a little dichotomy, but cover move.
[00:47:23] There's another doctrinal term that I love
[00:47:25] is supporting distance.
[00:47:27] I'm not allowed to be further away from Dave.
[00:47:30] If I can't defend Dave's position or cover for Dave
[00:47:35] because he's out of the range of my weapon systems,
[00:47:37] he's too far away.
[00:47:40] That's a perfect example of the cross-training
[00:47:41] he's talking about.
[00:47:42] I could be an infantryman.
[00:47:43] Do I need to be an expert on indirect fires?
[00:47:47] No, I probably don't need to know how to field strip every little,
[00:47:50] but you don't need to know how far that thing can shoot.
[00:47:52] Because if I get too far away from that supporting element
[00:47:55] and I go, well, the reason I got too far away
[00:47:57] is I didn't know how mortars worked.
[00:48:00] Cool, the outcome is your team gets annihilated.
[00:48:02] So do I need to know every single thing
[00:48:04] that the mortarple student commander knows?
[00:48:06] No, you don't, but you gotta know a little bit.
[00:48:08] You gotta know how you and you interact together.
[00:48:10] And so even that idea of cross-training is,
[00:48:12] if you don't have a sort of a functional understanding
[00:48:14] inside your company, use the example
[00:48:15] before of the salespeople and the customer satisfaction people.
[00:48:20] If you're a sales lead,
[00:48:22] and the only metric you measure for success
[00:48:24] is how much you sell,
[00:48:25] and you don't realize that in the return department,
[00:48:28] that number is the same, you're losing.
[00:48:30] You're losing because there's a piece that you don't,
[00:48:32] do you have to know everything they know?
[00:48:34] You don't, and actually you don't have time
[00:48:35] to know everything you know,
[00:48:36] but you gotta know enough.
[00:48:38] You gotta have enough understanding
[00:48:39] what's going on there to measure the success
[00:48:41] of the entire organization to include your team,
[00:48:44] and that requires a little bit of cross-training.
[00:48:45] And that is a perfect example of how come you need to know
[00:48:49] something about everybody.
[00:48:54] Small unit tactical exercises.
[00:48:56] Tactical exercises should be,
[00:48:58] as well prepared as training tests.
[00:48:59] As often as possible,
[00:49:00] the tactical situation for a field exercise
[00:49:02] should be laid in the framework of an echelon,
[00:49:05] one or two levels higher than participating unit.
[00:49:07] This is desirable to bring into play
[00:49:09] the necessary intelligence supply
[00:49:11] of evacuation in similar roles of supporting forces
[00:49:14] that have a bearing on the specific tactical operation.
[00:49:17] Don't confuse the squad leader however,
[00:49:19] by giving him everything that was
[00:49:21] in the battalion and company commanders orders.
[00:49:24] That's an interesting little point to bring up
[00:49:28] is that, well, they're saying that you need to test
[00:49:32] the subordinate unit, so you know,
[00:49:33] subordinate leadership unit, you can't just,
[00:49:35] and this is true in the SEAL teams,
[00:49:37] I can't test myself.
[00:49:39] If I'm relying on me as the platoon leader to test my platoon,
[00:49:44] it's very difficult to do that.
[00:49:46] Look, and it can happen,
[00:49:47] and there's some great platoon leaders that'll be able
[00:49:49] to do that, but there's platoon leaders that will,
[00:49:52] they'll pass every test for some reason with flying colors,
[00:49:55] because they're not really being tested.
[00:49:57] So it's good when you are utilizing the chain of command
[00:50:01] and some of the elements above to test the elements below.
[00:50:06] So that makes sense, again, he always emphasizes
[00:50:10] all exercises to be conducted under simulated combat conditions.
[00:50:13] I think we've covered that one enough.
[00:50:18] Despite limitations on our capabilities
[00:50:20] to conduct field exercises and combined arms training,
[00:50:23] I'm convinced that commanders can always
[00:50:24] devise ways and means of achieving essential training
[00:50:27] objectives. Now I'll give you an example that.
[00:50:30] We would want to have close air support
[00:50:34] in our urban environment for training.
[00:50:36] We'd want to have an AC 130 overhead.
[00:50:39] We'd want to have F-18s overhead.
[00:50:41] We'd want to have a Marine Corps fighter squadron
[00:50:43] ready to combat drop bombs for us.
[00:50:47] That doesn't always happen.
[00:50:48] In fact, it's very rare that we would get those live assets.
[00:50:52] So what would we do?
[00:50:53] We would either bring a pilot,
[00:50:55] or we'd bring a J-TAC, a person that was qualified to call,
[00:50:58] and we'd put them up on one of the buildings
[00:50:59] in our Mount Facility and we'd give them a radio.
[00:51:02] And look, it's almost the same thing.
[00:51:04] You know, you got a guy that understands how pilots talk
[00:51:07] and he imitates a pilot talking on the radio.
[00:51:10] And then we would put up simulated explosions to go off
[00:51:13] when they dropped the bomb in the right spot.
[00:51:15] We would blow something up and they'd get that.
[00:51:19] They'd get that satisfaction.
[00:51:21] Ha ha ha ha.
[00:51:22] In fact, there was a company we were using
[00:51:23] that had little model airplanes.
[00:51:26] They were actually big model airplanes,
[00:51:27] but the model airplanes would fly over
[00:51:30] and then explosions would happen.
[00:51:32] We kind of went the distance to fake the training realistic.
[00:51:35] Launching these, you know, F-18s that would come down
[00:51:38] and strafe the city and explosions would go off,
[00:51:42] pretty good, but that's a great way to do it.
[00:51:43] And what does it cost for me to give the radio
[00:51:46] to one of my J-TACs and stay at an building?
[00:51:49] It costs $0.00.
[00:51:51] What does it cost to get an F-18
[00:51:54] to give me, or a section of F-18s
[00:51:57] to give me a few hours of support
[00:51:59] because what, $100,000?
[00:52:03] Yeah.
[00:52:05] How much, how much fuel do you burn in an F-18?
[00:52:09] In an hour, 10,000 pounds?
[00:52:11] Ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:52:12] Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:52:14] Yes.
[00:52:15] Check.
[00:52:17] Check.
[00:52:18] Fffffffffffffff.
[00:52:19] Fffffffff.
[00:52:21] So there's always ways, figure ways out.
[00:52:24] Training exercise should be concluded with a critique
[00:52:27] to provide the basis for reviewing the action
[00:52:29] to indicate areas requiring additional training emphasis.
[00:52:32] Boom.
[00:52:33] Deep brief.
[00:52:34] Yes, we have to do that.
[00:52:37] The use of live ammunition is not authorized.
[00:52:39] When the use of live ammunition is not authorized
[00:52:43] or practical, or when it's used
[00:52:45] violate safety requirements, maximum utilization
[00:52:47] should be made of various simulators.
[00:52:49] Boom.
[00:52:50] Again, I basically couldn't rip that.
[00:52:52] You were a religious saint.
[00:52:53] Simulators can duplicate the sound of artillery
[00:52:55] machine gun smoke flash and most other effects
[00:52:58] associated with the noise and conditions of the battlefield,
[00:53:00] including just tires burning.
[00:53:04] Habitual use of aggressor in the field exercises
[00:53:09] is desirable to develop interest and realism.
[00:53:12] The training value to the unit functioning in an aggressor role
[00:53:16] should not be overlooked.
[00:53:18] The adherence to established tactical principles
[00:53:20] and techniques by the aggressor forces
[00:53:22] will aid the friendly force informing sound tackle
[00:53:25] hot habits.
[00:53:26] This is why we, in the sealed teams,
[00:53:29] picked up so much emphasis on force on force training
[00:53:33] using simunition or these high speed laser tag systems
[00:53:37] that we had.
[00:53:38] This is why.
[00:53:40] And that's basically all you guys did at Top Gun.
[00:53:43] It's 100% aggressor.
[00:53:46] And as an aggressor, what do you find at F-16?
[00:53:48] Yeah.
[00:53:52] How long does it take you to learn to fly at F-16?
[00:53:55] Not long.
[00:53:55] A couple months.
[00:53:56] If that part of it is not that hard.
[00:54:00] Are you worried when you go back to an F-18
[00:54:02] that you're going to have bad habits?
[00:54:04] There's something called negative transfer.
[00:54:06] So there's a couple of things that you got to pay attention to.
[00:54:09] You got to know that there are some differences
[00:54:11] that if you get those wrong, those can be really bad.
[00:54:13] But most of it transfers over pretty easily.
[00:54:16] The larger issue, like you were talking about.
[00:54:18] And my first real job at Top Gun was what's called
[00:54:22] the adversary officer.
[00:54:23] So my responsibility was to make sure
[00:54:25] that all the training scenarios that we developed
[00:54:27] at Top Gun on that same day.
[00:54:29] That's the good name to give some of the people
[00:54:30] that we work with.
[00:54:31] You're working with a company and you're like,
[00:54:34] oh, you know what?
[00:54:35] Maybe we'll just call you the adversarial officer.
[00:54:37] The adversarial officer.
[00:54:38] There's certainly people that we work with.
[00:54:40] We're thinking, man, go, you're working with a company.
[00:54:44] You think, hey, when I bring you into where I bring up
[00:54:48] your name, all I hear is like, bad things.
[00:54:51] This is not a good idea.
[00:54:53] What are you doing?
[00:54:54] What's going on over here?
[00:54:55] Are you the adversarial officer here?
[00:54:57] So sorry, cut you off.
[00:54:59] No, no, I just say, you know, we were talking about
[00:55:01] the challenge of that is the adversarial officer.
[00:55:03] Adversary officers job is to make sure
[00:55:06] that the training scenarios that we built
[00:55:08] on the adversary side.
[00:55:09] So the opposing force was realistic and reflected
[00:55:13] the capability of the enemy.
[00:55:14] So we provided real training for the blue students,
[00:55:18] for the friendly fighters going out to fight,
[00:55:20] because if they went out and fought an enemy
[00:55:22] that wasn't performing the way a real enemy would,
[00:55:24] they were going to be unprepared.
[00:55:26] We had an entire, you know, sell inside of Top Gun,
[00:55:29] designed just to learn and study enemy tactics
[00:55:33] to make our training more realistic.
[00:55:35] How, what is you have, did you have to fly the F-16
[00:55:37] a certain way to simulate?
[00:55:40] Normally, when we replicated a force on force.
[00:55:43] So there is something incremental training.
[00:55:45] So at the beginning of some phases of flight training,
[00:55:47] we limit the capability of the enemy aircraft
[00:55:50] to build, get some building blocks and fundamentals.
[00:55:53] But once we get to force on force training
[00:55:55] and most of Top Gun is straight up,
[00:55:56] just your best game, my best game as the adversary,
[00:56:00] I'm flying the F-16 to the Max performance capability.
[00:56:03] And how did the Max performance of the F-16
[00:56:07] compare to the Max performance of the SU-27
[00:56:10] or whichever close aircraft?
[00:56:12] So it's not exactly, but close.
[00:56:14] And better than a similar aircraft, F-18 against F-18,
[00:56:18] me trying to replicate a different airplane,
[00:56:21] like at the end of their machines.
[00:56:23] Now, a different machine, even if it doesn't fully replicate
[00:56:26] the enemy, it does things differently.
[00:56:28] And that alone is a really powerful tool
[00:56:30] to practice against, because it shows you things,
[00:56:33] oh, I can't do that on my machine.
[00:56:35] My machine won't do that this airplane can
[00:56:37] and have to have a tactic to respond to that.
[00:56:40] And my mistaken in that the early 90s
[00:56:42] when I went up to Fallen and I would go through
[00:56:45] some air wing training, would it be mistaken
[00:56:47] to think that they were aircraft up there besides the F-16
[00:56:50] that were acting as adversaries?
[00:56:51] No, I think you'd be correct.
[00:56:53] Did you have any other aircraft besides the F-16?
[00:56:57] What would you guys find?
[00:56:58] But what other adversary aircraft were available
[00:57:01] to your opposing force?
[00:57:03] Yeah, the ones that the Navy furnished,
[00:57:05] the most common ones for the Navy were the F-5
[00:57:08] and the F-16.
[00:57:09] But we also had contract air, so we had,
[00:57:12] you know, for F-5 freedom fighter?
[00:57:14] I, yes, you've got, absolutely,
[00:57:18] there was a squadron of F-5s in,
[00:57:22] as adversaries in Fallen,
[00:57:25] painted like enemy aircraft designed
[00:57:27] just to replicate an enemy threat.
[00:57:29] I remember those.
[00:57:30] Dude, absolutely.
[00:57:31] And did they have red stars on them?
[00:57:32] They totally did.
[00:57:33] I don't remember that.
[00:57:34] Absolutely.
[00:57:35] I actually, they might, they probably still have them.
[00:57:38] And we would outsource to, you know,
[00:57:40] we get the Air Force to come bring up some F-15s
[00:57:43] that to fly with us for a class.
[00:57:45] We get, you know, a contract company to fly,
[00:57:48] you know, French morageers and Israeli-Coffeeers,
[00:57:50] just whatever was out there to give you,
[00:57:53] the student, what we call a dissimilar look.
[00:57:57] F-18s against F-18s is not a great way
[00:57:59] to replicate real training.
[00:58:00] So you wanna give something that's different.
[00:58:02] Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse,
[00:58:04] but the fact that it's different
[00:58:06] creates much more realistic training.
[00:58:09] Well, why is it when I read about,
[00:58:12] like old school fighter and like test pilots?
[00:58:16] Like reading when we had Dan Patterson on,
[00:58:19] they're just getting in different aircraft.
[00:58:20] They're just flying out to Area 51,
[00:58:23] and just getting in random A-S and aircraft
[00:58:26] and just flying those things.
[00:58:28] Is that because those old school aircraft
[00:58:31] were more similar in terms of the way you fly them?
[00:58:34] No, man, I just think that those guys
[00:58:36] weren't afraid of anything.
[00:58:37] I'm like, I can fly that thing.
[00:58:38] I'm like, whatever.
[00:58:40] No, I think it was, you know,
[00:58:43] one of the coolest things that Dan Patterson talked about
[00:58:47] here on the podcast and just in general was the idea
[00:58:50] that hey, we need to go figure out how this stuff works.
[00:58:54] We need to get in these machines
[00:58:56] and figure out how they work.
[00:58:57] And if we don't, we're gonna go across to Vietnam
[00:59:01] and we're gonna lose,
[00:59:02] because we don't know how those machines work.
[00:59:04] And regulations and restrictions and safety.
[00:59:06] And all these things were forces,
[00:59:08] were counterweights to doing that.
[00:59:09] All the reasons not to doing.
[00:59:11] Was there a risk?
[00:59:12] Yeah, there's a ton of risk.
[00:59:13] That risk did not wait,
[00:59:15] did not wait going to Vietnam and losing.
[00:59:16] And they believed that.
[00:59:17] And they pushed hard against the institution
[00:59:20] to be able to do that.
[00:59:22] Yeah, and you know, the last podcast,
[00:59:24] we were talking about,
[00:59:26] I was talking about the 80s and the 90s.
[00:59:28] And look, when you're in,
[00:59:32] when it's the 80s and the 90s,
[00:59:33] and you've been tasked to do the best you can
[00:59:35] to maintain the spirit of going to war.
[00:59:39] But think of how hard the pushback is against pushing
[00:59:42] the envelope and training.
[00:59:43] When you're saying, listen,
[00:59:45] when you've got, we better push the envelope.
[00:59:47] Otherwise we're gonna go get killed in Vietnam.
[00:59:49] Yep.
[00:59:50] If it's 1994, it's like we better push the envelope.
[00:59:56] Otherwise, then they come back and you say,
[01:00:00] just hey, don't we push the envelope?
[01:00:01] Yeah.
[01:00:02] And it makes, you know, you're like,
[01:00:04] you know, go on it.
[01:00:05] Dude, that was a tough time.
[01:00:06] And if you look at kind of, are, are what we call
[01:00:10] the baseline adversary,
[01:00:11] if you think about countries that would be our adversaries
[01:00:13] now, China, Russia.
[01:00:15] Those countries were not a threat in 1994.
[01:00:18] They're really, the institution had a really hard time
[01:00:21] being convinced that we needed to train hard.
[01:00:25] It was really, it was a much harder cell.
[01:00:27] Now it's a very different environment.
[01:00:28] And you know, selling the training,
[01:00:31] the demonstrating why we need to do this is actually easier.
[01:00:34] Because back then, it was hard to make a compelling case
[01:00:38] why we needed to push the envelope for what?
[01:00:41] And when you guys would look at doing a mission back then,
[01:00:44] what were you thinking the big mission would be?
[01:00:48] The big mission in 1996, when you were thinking,
[01:00:52] all right, there may be a big mission
[01:00:55] that I need to be ready for.
[01:00:56] I mean, I guess we could look at the,
[01:00:58] the Boclins this time.
[01:00:59] Yeah, so the things in near memory were desert storm
[01:01:05] and multiple, you know, the coast of a former Yugoslavia,
[01:01:11] those there was enough of those in there.
[01:01:14] And there was always this, believe it or not,
[01:01:16] it held over there was always this specter of like,
[01:01:20] you know, great competition, you know, Russia and America,
[01:01:24] those type of things.
[01:01:25] So those are always there.
[01:01:26] And there was enough hold over from the kind of the Cold War
[01:01:31] era of leadership, which is the 80s
[01:01:32] and you know, very early 90s was,
[01:01:35] hey, this stuff all travels in sign waves
[01:01:37] and sooner or later, what's going to happen
[01:01:40] is that there are ability, which is obviously we know that.
[01:01:43] And so that specter of that was always there
[01:01:46] and the proliferation of their stuff all throughout Europe
[01:01:48] and, you know, great great work competition type stuff
[01:01:51] was always part of what we did.
[01:01:53] That makes sense and I guess it probably makes sense to think
[01:01:59] that what it was leaning towards in the teams
[01:02:03] back in those days and probably in, you know,
[01:02:06] in the greater ground troops, the ground forces
[01:02:10] was that these, this idea of like going into a sustained
[01:02:13] ground combat was really,
[01:02:16] that route was really, it seemed like a less likely thing
[01:02:19] all the time, less and less likely
[01:02:21] that we were gonna actually, hey, we're gonna,
[01:02:22] if you would have told me in 1995,
[01:02:26] hey, the US year, the frog men of the 2000s
[01:02:33] and the 2010s are gonna do deployment after deployment,
[01:02:37] after deployment after deployment, after deployment,
[01:02:39] to the desert and they're gonna be fighting
[01:02:42] in ground combat sustained for two decades.
[01:02:47] It would have been very, it would have been hard to predict.
[01:02:50] Yeah, but we trained, we trained and then we kept training.
[01:02:59] Next little section, testing a unit's proficiency,
[01:03:02] the chief objective of readiness training is to ensure
[01:03:04] that all units are maintained at a high rate
[01:03:06] of operational readiness throughout the year.
[01:03:08] That is that every unit is prepared to carry out
[01:03:11] its combat mission at any time.
[01:03:13] Operational readiness testing to determine
[01:03:15] your unit's operational,
[01:03:16] Teddy, operational readiness, you must provide testing.
[01:03:20] Any kind of talks about what to cover
[01:03:23] is a minimum amount.
[01:03:25] He talks about, you gotta, you know,
[01:03:27] these various abilities, the ability to rendezvous,
[01:03:29] the ability to shoot movement,
[01:03:30] come here, hey, all good.
[01:03:32] And he talks about, for best results,
[01:03:35] readiness test should be unannounced,
[01:03:37] which I totally agree with.
[01:03:40] These test should be practical demonstrations
[01:03:42] of how successfully a unit can be expected
[01:03:44] to execute all or any part of its emergency mission,
[01:03:48] totally get now.
[01:03:50] Here's where, here's where testing can concern me.
[01:03:57] When we do a test, we kind of have to give,
[01:04:01] hey, here's the task condition in standard, right?
[01:04:03] Here's what you're gonna be told to do,
[01:04:04] here's the standard, and here's what you need to do it, right?
[01:04:08] Or sorry, here's the task, right?
[01:04:10] This is what you have to do, here's the conditions
[01:04:11] of that task, and here's the standard that you have to meet.
[01:04:15] I was working with a government agency,
[01:04:20] and one of the tasks of this government agency
[01:04:24] was they had to be able to interdict vessels, small vessels.
[01:04:29] And so in order to interdict these vessels,
[01:04:32] they may have to disable the motor of that vessel.
[01:04:38] And so they had to be able to shoot a weapon
[01:04:42] from a moving vessel that they're in,
[01:04:45] add another moving vessel to disable an engine.
[01:04:49] Okay, got it.
[01:04:50] So over time that became a qualification
[01:04:53] that you had to get, and over time it became a test
[01:04:56] that you had to be able to successfully complete this test,
[01:05:00] in order to maintain this qualification to do it.
[01:05:02] And here's the thing.
[01:05:05] One of the guys that had this standard
[01:05:08] was telling me about the test,
[01:05:09] and he was complaining about the test.
[01:05:11] And what had happened was this test,
[01:05:13] the task condition in standards,
[01:05:16] were so controlled that there was no realism to it whatsoever.
[01:05:21] And it was okay, the target vessel will have
[01:05:26] a target on that vessel that is whatever,
[01:05:29] three feet by three feet,
[01:05:31] the vessel will be moving in XC state,
[01:05:35] which was no waves,
[01:05:36] they basically would do only do it
[01:05:38] if there was no waves happening whatsoever.
[01:05:40] And it will be moving at five knots,
[01:05:43] and the assault vessel will also be moving at five knots.
[01:05:47] The distance will be 14 feet,
[01:05:50] and it was just this whole thing.
[01:05:51] And so basically, it took zero skill to do it.
[01:05:54] It took zero skill,
[01:05:55] it was basically a 20 foot shot at a nice big target,
[01:06:00] and it didn't prove anything.
[01:06:02] With the reality of shooting an engine,
[01:06:04] to get an engine to go down on an outboard motor,
[01:06:06] it's a pretty tough thing, it's C state at night.
[01:06:08] There's a lot of things going on.
[01:06:09] And by the way, what weapons do you have?
[01:06:12] Because if you have, if you've got a laser on your weapon
[01:06:16] and it's at night, you've got night vision on,
[01:06:17] and you can train your laser on that
[01:06:19] and you're at a C state and you can keep it steady,
[01:06:20] you can fire a few rounds, cool.
[01:06:23] I worry about testing sometimes,
[01:06:26] because when you put tasks, conditions and standards,
[01:06:29] so that you can provide a test,
[01:06:30] oftentimes those restrict the environment
[01:06:34] and they make it canned.
[01:06:36] And when things become canned, you're not testing
[01:06:41] on what you want to test on.
[01:06:43] So I would always, you know,
[01:06:44] sort of have testing things, then I'd have the real test.
[01:06:48] You know, which is gonna be me, I'm,
[01:06:51] it's gonna be me, I'm, and that's what we wanna see.
[01:06:53] How do you handle the me, I'm?
[01:06:55] When you have night vision on and a laser,
[01:07:00] if you don't have night vision on, can you still see that laser?
[01:07:03] There's lasers that you can see,
[01:07:05] and there's lasers that you cannot see.
[01:07:07] So you could have a laser without night vision,
[01:07:10] that's a red laser, it's like what you see in the movies.
[01:07:12] Are you familiar with movies?
[01:07:14] Oh yeah, come on later, one.
[01:07:15] So you get laser where you, where you can see the little red dot?
[01:07:19] Yes sir.
[01:07:20] That's a visible laser.
[01:07:21] There's also IR lasers in for red lasers
[01:07:23] that you can't see without night vision on,
[01:07:25] but with night vision on, it's, it's actually insanely bright
[01:07:29] and clear.
[01:07:30] And then they have something that's an IR flood,
[01:07:33] which so you can actually are lighting up the entire target area
[01:07:36] with, so it's illuminated,
[01:07:38] and then there's a laser right in the center of it.
[01:07:41] And then you can see that without goggles.
[01:07:43] Nope, you need goggles.
[01:07:45] The equivalent to that would be just a regular flashlight,
[01:07:47] which we also have where you press a button
[01:07:49] and a flashlight comes on, and in the center
[01:07:51] of that flashlight there's a red laser.
[01:07:53] Gotcha.
[01:07:54] Okay, so I'll do it.
[01:07:55] Okay, you have all of that in your life.
[01:07:56] You have all that, you have all that on your weapon all the time.
[01:07:59] Oh dang, okay.
[01:08:00] So the whole deal.
[01:08:01] That's why when you see guys weapons now,
[01:08:03] it gets too hot, it's too hot.
[01:08:05] There's a lot of stuff going on on weapons.
[01:08:07] I did get better, you know,
[01:08:08] because all these little pieces are getting smaller
[01:08:10] and they're consolidating some of these pieces,
[01:08:12] so it's one piece instead of three different pieces.
[01:08:15] You know, now you can get like a grip
[01:08:18] that has a white light and a red laser in it.
[01:08:22] And the batteries.
[01:08:23] There was a time where you had the battery thing
[01:08:25] and then you had the laser thing
[01:08:26] and then you had a battery for the flashlight thing
[01:08:28] and you're gonna wires going all over the place.
[01:08:30] There's a total of gut check.
[01:08:31] Now it is, people are making stuff more square away.
[01:08:34] What about that one?
[01:08:36] You know, the ones that,
[01:08:38] like you could see the laser through the little lens
[01:08:41] almost kind of thing, you know?
[01:08:42] So that's like, or you can see the dots.
[01:08:43] You could see the dots.
[01:08:44] Yep, yep.
[01:08:45] That's just another type of system.
[01:08:47] And the enemy is not gonna be able to see that.
[01:08:50] But you guys don't have those.
[01:08:51] No, we have those too.
[01:08:52] On the deal.
[01:08:53] Okay.
[01:08:54] And the team's got everything.
[01:08:55] It's pretty awesome.
[01:08:55] Actually, what guys are doing now,
[01:08:57] that's really cool,
[01:08:58] because it's sort of getting next level,
[01:09:01] the way that the technology is just really getting
[01:09:06] so much better right now.
[01:09:07] High speed.
[01:09:08] Yeah, it's getting way more high speed
[01:09:09] and the guys systems are much better than they were,
[01:09:12] you know?
[01:09:13] I mean, the changes that took place
[01:09:18] from Vietnam to 1995 is tiny.
[01:09:25] Compared to the changes that took place last year.
[01:09:28] You know, this is exponentially better
[01:09:30] weapon systems.
[01:09:31] And not so much the weapon system,
[01:09:33] but the accoutrements that you put on the weapon systems
[01:09:37] are way better.
[01:09:39] I mean, I get kind of crazy when I'm watching
[01:09:42] like some of the new technologies coming out of the awesome,
[01:09:44] awesome to see.
[01:09:48] Next little section is, and by the way,
[01:09:51] just I skipped the, you were wondering, Dave,
[01:09:54] I told you I was gonna skip some stuff.
[01:09:56] The stuff that I skipped really goes into like,
[01:09:58] the details of each and every type of unit
[01:10:04] that you can be working with.
[01:10:05] And it goes into some very granular detail,
[01:10:08] good for a military leader,
[01:10:11] but a little bit too granular
[01:10:13] for general public consumption.
[01:10:15] And I haven't actually started the execution
[01:10:18] of publishing this thing on my own.
[01:10:20] I'm obviously gonna need to.
[01:10:21] This needs to be a jockel publishing book.
[01:10:24] So I gotta, I guess I gotta figure out the legality that.
[01:10:30] I think the legality is none.
[01:10:32] I think it's more than 50 years old,
[01:10:34] which means it's public domain.
[01:10:36] So I'll write a little forward to it.
[01:10:39] And we'll go from there.
[01:10:41] Go Dave.
[01:10:42] Yeah, I was writing a note that maybe I'll write the forward.
[01:10:45] The cool thing about the theme of this
[01:10:48] is that you've traced this back to the influence on you
[01:10:53] and the influence of the influencer on you.
[01:10:56] Well, there's now another layer here.
[01:10:58] Oh, one more layer deep of where we are all pulling this from,
[01:11:03] which is you recounting where you pulled it from.
[01:11:05] And now you're actually connected to where
[01:11:07] hack pulled it from.
[01:11:08] So, check.
[01:11:10] All right, sounds like the next jockel publishing book
[01:11:13] has been delineated.
[01:11:16] You know what's interesting?
[01:11:17] So the name of this and I brought this up already,
[01:11:19] but it's a stack poll publications.
[01:11:22] And by the way, stack poll publications, you're welcome,
[01:11:25] because I know I've read books from you that you publish.
[01:11:28] One of them I know is another clay pledge in St.
[01:11:31] Low, which we've covered a long time ago,
[01:11:32] to Glover John's which, by the way, is another connection
[01:11:35] back to Hackworth.
[01:11:37] And I talked about it.
[01:11:38] I'm pretty sure some copies of this clay
[01:11:42] pages in St. Low's sold.
[01:11:43] I wrote stack poll books in email.
[01:11:46] And said, hey, I'm here.
[01:11:47] Here's a book.
[01:11:48] I'm trying to find.
[01:11:49] I haven't been able to find it.
[01:11:52] I love to do something right-of-forward,
[01:11:56] you know, republish this thing, whatever.
[01:11:59] Never heard back from them, unfortunately.
[01:12:01] You know, I probably, I don't think I was persistent enough.
[01:12:04] I probably said I'm one, maybe two emails.
[01:12:06] So I probably should have done a better job
[01:12:08] and explain to them maybe better where I was coming from.
[01:12:12] Didn't do a good enough job, but hopefully,
[01:12:15] we'll do something with it.
[01:12:17] So back to this training for contingency operations.
[01:12:22] In addition to being prepared to execute combat missions
[01:12:25] as part of a combined force, units overseas
[01:12:27] must be trained and ready to perform a wide variety
[01:12:29] of contingency operations.
[01:12:30] It is not possible to identify all contingencies
[01:12:33] which may face Army unit stations overseas.
[01:12:36] Generally, a unit that is well trained
[01:12:37] for its basic combat mission will be capable
[01:12:41] of supporting contingency operations.
[01:12:43] Commanders must be aware, however,
[01:12:45] that their troops may be employed in areas
[01:12:47] where the weather and terrain differ greatly
[01:12:49] from that found in areas in which their station.
[01:12:52] Combat ready elements should be air transportable
[01:12:55] for movement on short, notice to potential trouble areas.
[01:12:57] They should be trained to quail civil disturbances,
[01:12:59] control riots, guard or recover critical installations,
[01:13:03] bolster civil authorities and police provide emergency relief
[01:13:08] from natural disasters and handle numerous other related tasks.
[01:13:13] And imagine Commander can visualize
[01:13:15] appropriate and feasible contingency missions for as unit
[01:13:18] and present it with appropriate training situations.
[01:13:20] Now, here's something that I'll throw in there.
[01:13:23] It says such training will provide variety
[01:13:26] but must be based on logical conditions.
[01:13:27] It'd be realistic.
[01:13:28] The thing that I'll throw in there is,
[01:13:31] since you don't know what these contingencies are,
[01:13:34] you have to train people on what to do
[01:13:36] and they don't know what to do.
[01:13:39] How do you assess a situation?
[01:13:41] How do you look at it?
[01:13:42] How do you look at it with an open mind?
[01:13:44] And that's one of the real benefits of I had
[01:13:48] of growing up in the seal teams is we've lacked doctrine.
[01:13:51] We have more now, man, when I grew,
[01:13:53] when I was got in the teams, there was no,
[01:13:55] there's almost no, there's all word amount.
[01:13:58] And so when you got told, hey, you're going to do this type
[01:14:01] of mission, you just got told word amount of how you're going
[01:14:04] to do it.
[01:14:04] And if it was a type of mission that no one had ever done
[01:14:06] before, we were going to sit there and make up how to do it.
[01:14:08] There was no book to refer to.
[01:14:10] We didn't, and we didn't have, I'll tell you what, we didn't have
[01:14:14] in 1995.
[01:14:18] No one ever said to me, hey, we're doing an assault.
[01:14:22] Here's the army manual of what they do.
[01:14:25] No one ever said that.
[01:14:26] I never saw an army manual in the teams in the 90s.
[01:14:33] It was all word amount.
[01:14:37] So you had to, you have to put people in situations
[01:14:40] where you go, hey, hey, they's a random mission figure out
[01:14:42] how you're going to do this.
[01:14:44] Figure out how you're going to do this.
[01:14:45] And then you see what they do.
[01:14:48] And there are protocols for what to do when you don't know
[01:14:50] what to do.
[01:14:55] Then it gets into this section right here, which is,
[01:14:59] I was like, oh, maybe I'll skip this.
[01:15:00] And then I read like four lines.
[01:15:01] I'm like, all right, this is freaking awesome.
[01:15:03] So guidelines for planning, brigade, and battalion attacks.
[01:15:12] Training, regardless of size of unit has but one purpose.
[01:15:18] That is to teach effectively the techniques of combat.
[01:15:22] The attack is the key to success.
[01:15:26] The defense is merely a temporary expedient
[01:15:29] to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere
[01:15:33] or to prepare for an attack at a future date.
[01:15:36] So the only reason you're going on defense
[01:15:38] is so that you can go back on the attack.
[01:15:40] That's the only reason you're going,
[01:15:42] everything is to attack.
[01:15:43] That's all you're doing.
[01:15:44] You're going to attack.
[01:15:45] Oh, we got to hesitate, cool.
[01:15:46] Where has dating so that we can attack later?
[01:15:49] That's what we're doing.
[01:15:50] We're going to attack.
[01:15:52] The consequences of having an attack
[01:15:54] grind to a halt are great.
[01:15:56] The effort required for it to bounce back is tremendous.
[01:15:59] Once an attack is launched,
[01:16:00] its momentum must be maintained until the objective
[01:16:03] or objectives are seized and secured.
[01:16:05] Battle losses received due to poor planning
[01:16:07] and faulty execution are inexcusable
[01:16:10] and will result in a loss of respect for and confidence
[01:16:13] in the commander.
[01:16:16] The best reputation a commander can have
[01:16:18] is that he accomplishes his missions with few losses.
[01:16:26] The end sought in planning and executing
[01:16:29] an attack is brought about by deliberate planning
[01:16:32] and violent execution.
[01:16:34] The opposite is fatal.
[01:16:38] Speed and planning is often needed,
[01:16:40] but haste should be avoided.
[01:16:44] Remember that in combat, there is no second opportunity
[01:16:46] and seldom opportunity for rehearsals.
[01:16:49] This deliberate planning is accomplished in five phases.
[01:16:53] Phase one, basic factors, principal factors,
[01:16:56] which must be considered by a commander
[01:16:58] in deliberate planning are mission.
[01:17:00] Enemy situation troops available, terrain and weather.
[01:17:04] This is something we all learn basic,
[01:17:06] mission enemy troops available, terrain and weather.
[01:17:08] Phase two, tentative plan of attack.
[01:17:12] How much time do I support it and I have
[01:17:14] for reconnaissance planning and the issuance of order?
[01:17:17] What general scheme and maneuver do I want to employ?
[01:17:19] What formations are feasible?
[01:17:20] What does the mobility of my command?
[01:17:22] How much dispersing can I achieve
[01:17:24] and still accomplish my mission with speed and violence?
[01:17:27] What supporting nuclear fires are planned for
[01:17:30] or are available to me and for adjacent units?
[01:17:35] We're not got to that.
[01:17:36] I'm thinking, wow.
[01:17:39] Wow.
[01:17:40] This is, I think this book is 1962, 1963.
[01:17:44] This is like it's on cold war.
[01:17:47] And we're thinking if I,
[01:17:49] if I'm gonna do an attack, you know what?
[01:17:50] We may bring in some tactical nukes.
[01:17:53] That's where we're at. So these guys are planning
[01:17:59] and thinking and thinking through using
[01:18:02] nuclear weapons on the battlefield.
[01:18:07] How can I employ my conventional fire support?
[01:18:09] That's a secondary thought by the way,
[01:18:11] my primary is going nuke.
[01:18:12] What logistical problems problems do I have?
[01:18:14] Can I support the operation logistically?
[01:18:16] What is the status of personnel and equipment?
[01:18:18] How can I best use my supporting elements to include armor?
[01:18:21] Per armor personnel carriers and helicopters?
[01:18:23] Our communication facilities at adequate.
[01:18:26] Can I communicate with my supporting units?
[01:18:27] Do their radio is net with mine?
[01:18:29] What flank security problems do I have?
[01:18:31] How can I best control the attack?
[01:18:33] From where?
[01:18:34] What control measures?
[01:18:36] What must I be ready to do next when I have seized
[01:18:38] and secured the objective?
[01:18:42] So that's that right there.
[01:18:43] That was the tentative plan of attack.
[01:18:47] And then it goes detail plan of attack,
[01:18:49] having analyzed these factors and having developed
[01:18:51] a tentative plan based on this analysis,
[01:18:53] the commanders ready to get down to details.
[01:18:55] These things must then be considered.
[01:18:57] What is the formation that we will be initially used?
[01:19:00] Mounted dismounted or by helicopter?
[01:19:02] What units will be in the initial attack?
[01:19:04] What units are being supporting or in reserve?
[01:19:08] What will constitute my base of fire?
[01:19:09] Because it's all covered move.
[01:19:11] We're going to have a base of fire,
[01:19:12] we're going to have an element maneuvering.
[01:19:15] We'll forward assembly areas or attack positions
[01:19:19] be used for my attacking troops.
[01:19:21] If so, where?
[01:19:22] When will my components of my fire support start?
[01:19:26] When will we ship fire and stop?
[01:19:27] How will I range for this to happen?
[01:19:29] How can I exploit the effects of my supporting nuclear fires?
[01:19:34] Oh, it's so crazy to think about.
[01:19:37] Yeah.
[01:19:42] From what position will each of my attacking elements
[01:19:45] start their attacking by fire and maneuver?
[01:19:49] Cover and move.
[01:19:52] This is the true line of departure
[01:19:54] and should be considered as such.
[01:19:55] That's an LD.
[01:19:58] There may be other courting lines or points in there.
[01:20:01] How and from what distance will I start a coordinated assault?
[01:20:04] What command signal and contingent will I use to start it?
[01:20:07] What reports will I expect from my subordinate units?
[01:20:10] What reports will I give to my superiors?
[01:20:12] With whom should I establish liaison?
[01:20:14] How when and where should I issue my attack order?
[01:20:18] What arrangements should I make for this?
[01:20:21] And then it gets into the war gaming.
[01:20:23] So the reason I'm going through this is like,
[01:20:24] think of the level of detail.
[01:20:25] Think of the, you know, I got that section of discipline
[01:20:28] equals freedom field man.
[01:20:28] Or I was like, question everything.
[01:20:30] This is it, man.
[01:20:31] What are we doing?
[01:20:33] How are we doing it?
[01:20:34] Having a checklist like this to think about
[01:20:36] before you conduct an operation?
[01:20:38] I don't care if you're at a business.
[01:20:39] I don't care if you're going to grocery store.
[01:20:41] Thinking about what you're going to be facing.
[01:20:44] This is a smart way to operate.
[01:20:50] Phase four, war gaming the plan.
[01:20:55] The commander now having come to a pretty firm idea
[01:20:57] of what he wants to do and how he wants to do it.
[01:20:59] Now war games it in his mind
[01:21:01] and ask himself the following questions.
[01:21:04] This is when you're trying to punch holes in your own plan
[01:21:07] to the maximum extent possible.
[01:21:08] Have I based my plan on knowledge,
[01:21:10] gain through active ground, map,
[01:21:13] and aerial reconnaissance and knowledge of the enemy situation?
[01:21:18] Have I analyzed the enemy defense thoroughly
[01:21:20] thereby locating and taking advantage of weaknesses
[01:21:23] in enemy disposition or terrain
[01:21:25] where the defender cannot use his weapons
[01:21:27] or obstacles to advantage?
[01:21:29] Have I given adequate consideration to terrain
[01:21:32] and whether one affects the have on the accomplishment
[01:21:34] of my mission?
[01:21:34] Have I planned for maximum exploitation
[01:21:37] of available nuclear fires?
[01:21:39] Have I considered troop safety in the planning
[01:21:42] of my nuclear fires and scheme of maneuver?
[01:21:45] Have I considered the use of armored personnel carriers?
[01:21:47] Have I considered the effects of nuclear weapons
[01:21:50] upon the terrain over which I am attacking?
[01:21:52] Blowdown contaminated areas, secondary fires.
[01:21:58] I didn't know what blowdown was.
[01:22:00] I had to look it up, guess where I went.
[01:22:01] I went to FM 100, attack 30 nuclear operations.
[01:22:06] What is it?
[01:22:07] Blowdown is when trees get blown down
[01:22:11] and they're splintered and they create just obstacles
[01:22:15] everywhere, they're very hard to move through.
[01:22:17] So you got to account for that in your assault.
[01:22:19] Got to account for the blowdown of the nuclear weapons
[01:22:22] you used to prep the area for assault?
[01:22:28] Man.
[01:22:30] Have I provided for full shock effect on the enemy?
[01:22:33] This comes from surprise tanks and strengths,
[01:22:35] attacks from several directions,
[01:22:37] simultaneously intensity of supporting fires
[01:22:39] during the assault and the speed of the assault
[01:22:41] by use of armored personnel carriers and helicopters.
[01:22:44] Does my plan provide for the waiting of the main effort?
[01:22:47] Have I used attacking units as a base of fire
[01:22:50] when I have artillery heavy weapons and mortars for this purpose?
[01:22:54] Isn't it crazy that everything is covered move?
[01:22:56] Everything is covered move.
[01:22:59] The use of tanks for this purpose is especially
[01:23:01] faulty if the tanks could be used in the attack role
[01:23:03] to close with the enemy and overrun them.
[01:23:06] Has the excessive use of attack troops as a base of fire
[01:23:11] as reserves or as reconnaissance and security elements
[01:23:14] cause me to have two little strength in the attack?
[01:23:18] Have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives?
[01:23:23] Which, I don't want to go back to number 10.
[01:23:26] Here.
[01:23:28] Have I used too much of the attack troops in the base of fire?
[01:23:33] So when you have, would be doing assaults,
[01:23:35] like let's say it's a basic seal platoon in the 90s.
[01:23:41] And we'd be doing an assault.
[01:23:43] And so you have a base of fire and then you have an assault element.
[01:23:46] And you could say, okay, squad one,
[01:23:50] you're going to be the base element squad two.
[01:23:51] You're going to be the assault element.
[01:23:54] So squad one, you're going to lay down this base of fire.
[01:23:57] And while you're laying down that base of fire,
[01:23:59] in comes the maneuver element, the assault element
[01:24:01] is going to move into position.
[01:24:03] And then they're going to start going through the target
[01:24:05] and then the base of fire is going to shift off the target.
[01:24:08] But they've suppressed the enemy fire
[01:24:09] and now you can go through pretty clean.
[01:24:11] So there's a tendency to think, well,
[01:24:13] you don't have to have this base of fire.
[01:24:14] Why don't I take my machine gunners from squad two
[01:24:19] and put them in the base element.
[01:24:21] So then they have massive fire power.
[01:24:23] And plus that means the assault element's a little bit lighter.
[01:24:25] They can move a little bit quicker.
[01:24:27] And we're good.
[01:24:29] And I remember sitting in a platoon brief
[01:24:31] and we were going to do that.
[01:24:33] And wasn't my plan. I was like a new guy.
[01:24:35] Literally a new guy.
[01:24:36] I was just sitting there going,
[01:24:38] okay, tell me what to do.
[01:24:40] And the plan got briefed.
[01:24:42] Hey, okay, this is how we're going to task organized
[01:24:45] for this assault.
[01:24:46] We're going to put all the machine gunners.
[01:24:48] So four machine gunners in the base element.
[01:24:51] And so we're going to have this massive fire power.
[01:24:53] And then these other guys, the point man from the squad one
[01:24:57] and the rear security from squad one
[01:24:59] and whatever one of the corpsmen from squad
[01:25:00] they're going to go down and they're going to go through the assault element.
[01:25:03] And so then the old master chief says,
[01:25:07] well, what if what if the assault element gets compromised?
[01:25:11] They got no machine guns.
[01:25:13] What if the base element wants the assault element gets compromised
[01:25:18] and starts to engage the target?
[01:25:20] What happens if now they have to go on the assault?
[01:25:23] And now the base of fire is weak from the former assault element.
[01:25:27] So what did that tell me?
[01:25:29] I remember sitting there thinking, okay, you got to be.
[01:25:31] That's a contingency.
[01:25:33] And what you're really doing is you're you're you're you're
[01:25:36] you're giving away so much tactical advantage because not only that,
[01:25:40] a seal puttune squad is meant to work a certain way.
[01:25:44] There's a reason it's designed that way.
[01:25:46] And all of a sudden you mix it all up.
[01:25:47] And now you're now with not really a seal squad anymore.
[01:25:49] They're no freaking machine gunners in it.
[01:25:52] What's a seal freaking squad without machine gunners?
[01:25:56] But you've taken those machine gunners away.
[01:25:59] And then you've overly burdened the other one with too many machine gunners.
[01:26:04] So that idea of hey, I'm going to make these adjustments for this particular situation.
[01:26:13] And if everything goes perfect, it's good.
[01:26:17] But if anything changes, it's bad.
[01:26:20] What are the chances things are going to go a little bit different?
[01:26:23] The chances are freaking too high.
[01:26:26] And you don't really gain that much.
[01:26:28] There's not really that much of a advantage anyways.
[01:26:31] So that that reminding me of that.
[01:26:34] Next, have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives, which distract from the attainment
[01:26:38] of the final objective?
[01:26:41] Intermediate objectives facilitate control and maintain direction.
[01:26:44] However, too many such objectives destroy flexibility and initiative and tend to slow up
[01:26:49] the attack.
[01:26:50] Man.
[01:26:53] Man, that's good.
[01:26:54] You know what's good about that?
[01:26:55] I like that because it's contrary to what we all
[01:26:57] say.
[01:26:58] I say, and I'm saying, we not, I'm not just talking about Esslope front.
[01:27:02] You know, people hate what?
[01:27:03] And it makes sense.
[01:27:04] We know it makes sense.
[01:27:05] Hey, we got this big project to do.
[01:27:06] Okay, let's figure out some intermediate steps that we have some short term goals.
[01:27:10] And we can move in that direction.
[01:27:11] And it feels good.
[01:27:12] We get gratification.
[01:27:13] We make sure we're on track.
[01:27:15] There's a big copy.
[01:27:16] Can we go too far with that?
[01:27:17] Yes, we absolutely can.
[01:27:20] Now all of a sudden, we've got goals that we're trying to achieve or doing reports on goals that
[01:27:23] don't even freaking matter.
[01:27:25] Don't let that happen.
[01:27:27] Have I determined the time and space factors of attacking units from the light into
[01:27:31] departure back to the assembly area?
[01:27:34] Have I set the stage for the assault?
[01:27:36] Have I set the light limited or the light into departure too far back?
[01:27:40] Have I used my forward air control or supporting artillery commander, supporting battery,
[01:27:45] mortar commander, engineer, put two meter, communications officer, assault, assault, gun
[01:27:49] put two meter, reconnaissance put two meter surgeon and my planning.
[01:27:54] And my staff in planning, checking and completing the detailed plans.
[01:27:58] And I'm kind of breezing through, but that one right there, I'm going to pause.
[01:28:02] So he names off all these different people, all these different professionals.
[01:28:07] And then he says, have I used them in planning, checking and completing the details of my
[01:28:13] plans?
[01:28:16] And the reason I want to focus on that, because a bunch of times he talks about, hey, I got
[01:28:19] to give my plan to have I give my plan clearly.
[01:28:21] And what he's saying here is it's not my plan.
[01:28:24] It's the plan of the artillery guy, the mortar guy, the engineer guy, the communications
[01:28:29] guy, the assault guy, the reconnaissance guy, the surgeon, and my staff, it's their plan.
[01:28:37] Have I used them to come up with this plan?
[01:28:41] And if I haven't, then I'm wrong.
[01:28:45] Have I considered the ammunition available to my fire support units?
[01:28:49] Are my supporting fires plans that there will be no laws during critical phase of the attack?
[01:28:52] Have I given consideration the use of nuclear fires?
[01:28:58] To time fire over my tanks, if the tanks are available to smoke, to having my infantry
[01:29:02] follow closely as supporting fires does my plan require holding up any elements during the
[01:29:06] attack to clear barriers or obstacles?
[01:29:09] Does my plan of attack for sea and provide for the next step in case of success, partial
[01:29:15] success, or failure?
[01:29:20] Is this planning?
[01:29:24] But think about that.
[01:29:25] Do I have a plan for success?
[01:29:28] Partial success or failure?
[01:29:29] Do I know what I'm going to do?
[01:29:31] Have I given some unit the mission of watching and securing my flanks?
[01:29:38] Have I ensured that after the seizure of the objective, my units have a detailed plan for
[01:29:43] consolidation, reorganization, and continuing the attacks that they will not rest on their
[01:29:47] goals thus exposing themselves to a surprise counter attack and losses from enemy fires or
[01:29:52] the loss of the initiative?
[01:29:58] Just imagine sitting down with your leadership as you assess something that you're going
[01:30:03] to do and trying to come up with this many holes to punch in your own plan.
[01:30:10] If you're not doing this, the holes don't get filled in.
[01:30:18] Having next phases of the attack order, having war game the plan in his mind and being
[01:30:25] satisfied as to his condition.
[01:30:27] I know I'll say this, it's not in his mind as far as I'm concerned.
[01:30:30] I'm getting the staff together.
[01:30:31] We're going to sit there.
[01:30:32] I'm going to have everyone beat this plan up.
[01:30:34] We're going to go through these questions.
[01:30:35] We're going to come up with more questions.
[01:30:37] Having worked game the plan in his mind and being satisfied as to his solution to commander
[01:30:41] then proceeds to the actual issuing of his order, it can be assumed that some time during
[01:30:45] the foregoing phases he has in addition considered the following.
[01:30:48] He's not even done considering yet.
[01:30:51] I must not take so much time in making my plans and announcing my orders that my subordinate
[01:30:58] have inadequate time before each hour.
[01:31:01] In case of doubt, I will send a staff officer forward to a subordinate commander rather
[01:31:04] than calling him back or hold my conference for issuing orders well for it.
[01:31:09] What does that mean?
[01:31:10] We're taking care of the frontline commander.
[01:31:12] Dude, hey, Dave, I know you're preparing for this right now, but I want you to come
[01:31:16] back to my location so I can brief you.
[01:31:18] No, I'll send a guy out to get you.
[01:31:21] Make sure you know what you need to know.
[01:31:25] In order to avoid misunderstandings and overlooking and important things, I must issue my orders
[01:31:31] in the standard sequence.
[01:31:33] I must make sure that every commander knows what he is to do and win.
[01:31:39] I must impress all with the need for vigorous execution of my plans.
[01:31:47] If the answers to all these are satisfactory, you and your units are off to a good start.
[01:31:54] Dude, what?
[01:31:57] What do you like about that?
[01:31:58] If you do all these things.
[01:32:00] Yeah.
[01:32:01] All these things.
[01:32:03] You're off to a good start.
[01:32:04] You're off to a good start.
[01:32:05] You made the first step in the right direction.
[01:32:08] Do not later second guess your decisions and change your orders.
[01:32:13] Now this is one to talk about at least a little bit.
[01:32:20] Are there times when you need to change your orders?
[01:32:22] Absolutely.
[01:32:23] Are there times when new intelligence comes to light and you say to yourself, you know what?
[01:32:27] The plan that I came up with is no longer optimal.
[01:32:30] I need to change it.
[01:32:31] Is that happened?
[01:32:32] Yes.
[01:32:35] Are there times where you, you, some micro change occurs on the battlefield and you decide
[01:32:43] to change plans that's already been rehearsed, fought through and everyone's been briefed.
[01:32:50] And now you're going to throw a curve ball in everybody.
[01:32:53] I can almost guarantee you that you should just, as we used to say in the teams, plan
[01:32:59] your dive and then dive your plan.
[01:33:01] Then you're diving dive so you come up with a plan and then go and execute your plan.
[01:33:05] When you start throwing curve balls and trying to change things on the fly, is actually
[01:33:11] evident, evident, hayford from Black Rifle Coffee.
[01:33:14] I was out doing some archery with him and we were talking about something he goes, yeah,
[01:33:20] yeah, we'll just figure it out under water.
[01:33:22] Which is, which is actually hilarious thing because when you're diving, obviously you can't
[01:33:26] talk, you can't figure anything out under water.
[01:33:28] And surprisingly, I'd never heard that expression before, but it's freaking awesome.
[01:33:32] It's freaking awesome.
[01:33:33] Hey, we'll just figure it out under water.
[01:33:35] Meaning if we let this go, we are screwed.
[01:33:39] We're screwed.
[01:33:40] So you don't want to figure things out under water.
[01:33:42] What you do is you dive your plan.
[01:33:44] This is such a, this is why leadership is hard because there are absolutely times where
[01:33:48] you go, you know what, bad plan.
[01:33:50] We need to change, we need to change it right now.
[01:33:52] We need to change the plan right now.
[01:33:55] That's fine.
[01:33:57] There's also times where you say, you know what, we're close.
[01:34:00] And what we will gain from trying to adjust this plan right now will be the adjustments.
[01:34:08] We'll be so hard to make it this juncture that it's going to counter any positives that
[01:34:12] will come from trying to change these plan right now.
[01:34:16] So you have to be careful of that.
[01:34:20] Don't harass the subordinate commanders while they are planning.
[01:34:24] Make sure you're there orders and getting ready to carry out their assignments.
[01:34:28] You and your staff should make such checks as are needed without violating this.
[01:34:32] So other of the frontline troops, once the attack starts, you can influence the battle
[01:34:36] by shifting of supporting fires maneuver and use of your reserves.
[01:34:39] You should be prepared to do this.
[01:34:41] You should now anticipate what may happen so that you will be at the critical spot at the
[01:34:47] critical time to give that command push necessary to keep the attack going.
[01:34:57] Commanders should make planning the attack a subject for schools and table exercises
[01:35:03] and tactical walks or rides for the appropriate officers.
[01:35:07] And man, I know you didn't get a chance to do EF battlefield, which we went out to get
[01:35:11] his bird.
[01:35:12] But that tactical walk that we tend to just, it's freaking awesome.
[01:35:16] It's awesome.
[01:35:19] Walking the battlefield and understanding the terrain and seeing it on the ground is absolutely
[01:35:25] phenomenal.
[01:35:26] Lessons learned are incredible.
[01:35:27] I'm going to have Jason and Steve on.
[01:35:30] We're going to talk about that.
[01:35:34] And this is really the last piece and we'll hold off for one more episode.
[01:35:41] One more one more episode for me to fulfill my own personal satisfaction in this book.
[01:35:51] A commander who prepares a checklist from these guidelines will have a great aid in time
[01:35:57] of pressure.
[01:35:58] He will enable him to plan thoroughly with speed instead of haste.
[01:36:06] So speed instead of haste.
[01:36:14] Do essential things first.
[01:36:16] Do things right the first time.
[01:36:19] Practice more than one thing at a time.
[01:36:25] So many just quotes to think about.
[01:36:29] I think one of the first quotes I sent you in a little picture.
[01:36:33] The attack is the key to success.
[01:36:36] The defense is merely a temporary expedient to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere, or to
[01:36:42] prepare for an attack at a future date.
[01:36:48] So many good quotes.
[01:36:49] And look, I'm not saying that you should blindly follow the thoughts and ideas in this
[01:36:58] book.
[01:36:59] And I would never say it.
[01:37:01] And we've gone back and forth and we've come to that areas where we disagree with what
[01:37:06] the general has to say.
[01:37:08] But I'll tell you what, add a minimum.
[01:37:09] You should consider them.
[01:37:13] You should consider.
[01:37:14] They could consider those thoughts.
[01:37:19] You should understand where they came from.
[01:37:21] You should understand what they meant.
[01:37:23] You should.
[01:37:24] I should keep them in front of mind because these are lessons that were written and blood.
[01:37:31] And they were proved on the battlefield.
[01:37:36] And they were meant as the book states, and you know what I'm saying here saying, hey,
[01:37:40] don't you don't follow blindly, guess what the book is called?
[01:37:43] The book is called guidelines.
[01:37:46] It's called guidelines.
[01:37:49] Guidelines are supposed to steer us.
[01:37:51] They're supposed to get us going in the right direction.
[01:37:55] They're not supposed to be followed blindly.
[01:37:58] They're not supposed to be obeyed with no deviation whatsoever.
[01:38:04] They're supposed to steer us.
[01:38:06] They're supposed to steer the people that we lead in the right direction.
[01:38:16] What do you think, Dave?
[01:38:20] It's kind of crazy, right?
[01:38:21] It's crazy.
[01:38:22] That I'm scribbling.
[01:38:24] I'm writing notes on this.
[01:38:26] I'm thinking about, I'm just thinking about, almost trying to put myself in general
[01:38:35] clerks shoes, as if I could do that.
[01:38:39] That's page after page, after page of what appears to be all this kind of a new shovel.
[01:38:46] These little details he's bringing out.
[01:38:49] But they're all things.
[01:38:50] Just like you just said, these are all things that he is probably seen over and over again.
[01:38:56] See the reason why teams don't succeed.
[01:39:01] I was trying to summarize what he was saying in my mind is, how much of your plan, how
[01:39:05] much of this thing that you've created, you build the strategy.
[01:39:08] This is what we're going to do.
[01:39:10] Then you build a plan.
[01:39:11] How much of that plan, as you go through these other phases, to test it and pressure,
[01:39:15] test it and consider the errors in it, how much of that is really based in reality?
[01:39:22] How much of is based in truth?
[01:39:24] How much is this what you're contributing?
[01:39:26] Your own brain thinking, this is all going to work out.
[01:39:28] My idea is brilliant.
[01:39:30] I know what's going to happen.
[01:39:31] I put it all together in my head.
[01:39:32] This is how I was going to play out this perfect scenario that I create.
[01:39:37] He's basically saying, don't do that.
[01:39:40] Bring in all these other people to annihilate and poke holes and dig and pick and pull
[01:39:47] every possible error and omission.
[01:39:49] All of the things you haven't done in your plan and in the same breath he's saying,
[01:39:57] and oh, by the way, we're going to stick to the plan.
[01:40:00] The reason we're going to stick to the plan is because actually it's not my plan anymore.
[01:40:03] It hasn't been my plan for a long time because always people came in and understand what
[01:40:07] we're trying to do, pick to the part and they're the ones are going to go execute.
[01:40:12] You talked about humility before.
[01:40:15] The humility of a leader to say, I built the strategy, but the plan, you know why you
[01:40:21] guys are all here to figure out everything wrong with it.
[01:40:25] So you can go execute when the scenario completely falls apart because there's no way I can
[01:40:28] predict what's going to happen.
[01:40:31] I mean, that is crazy.
[01:40:34] The application to that in life is, especially since this is a guideline.
[01:40:40] It is universal because that's what you need to do.
[01:40:43] I don't know the tactic, I don't know how the things are going to play out.
[01:40:46] I don't.
[01:40:48] But hearing what he's saying and the risk of creating it in your own mind and saying, this
[01:40:54] is what's going to go happen, go execute and setting your team up to fail for not being
[01:40:58] prepared for the thousands of contingencies that are absolutely going to happen with your
[01:41:02] plan.
[01:41:03] That finish was, and I know it's not the finish of the whole thing, but that finish was crazy.
[01:41:07] And then he likes to, he concludes with it.
[01:41:09] Oh, by the way, if you do all these things, you're after good start.
[01:41:12] You're off to a good start.
[01:41:13] Oh, that's that's man.
[01:41:14] I think I talked about it in the EF online.
[01:41:19] I think I might have even talked about the debrief podcast of planning with a negative attitude.
[01:41:25] Like, when you're coming up with a plan, you should be looking at that thing as a total
[01:41:29] pessimist.
[01:41:31] This isn't going to work.
[01:41:32] We're not going to have enough people.
[01:41:33] The enemy is going to be there.
[01:41:34] That's how you want to plan.
[01:41:36] And then the other thing you got to be careful of, you know, you just said thousands
[01:41:40] of contingencies.
[01:41:41] And there are thousands of contingencies.
[01:41:45] And there's no possible way you can plan for thousands of contingencies.
[01:41:50] What you can do is you can have decentralized command.
[01:41:55] You can have a plan that's adaptable.
[01:41:57] You can give people the freedom to maneuver, to adapt to those contingencies, which are
[01:42:02] unforeseen.
[01:42:05] As long as they understand why they're doing what they're doing and they understand what
[01:42:08] the intent of the operation is, they can make a thousand decisions that never even talk
[01:42:13] to you.
[01:42:14] Never talk to you one time.
[01:42:17] That's the goal.
[01:42:18] The plan has to be flexible enough.
[01:42:20] The command needs to be decentralized down to the lowest possible level.
[01:42:26] And as long as everybody understands what it is that we're trying to accomplish, they
[01:42:29] understand why they're doing what they're doing.
[01:42:31] They understand the intent of the operation.
[01:42:34] They can make a thousand decisions by themselves and get the mission done.
[01:42:44] That is a powerful thing to think about.
[01:42:47] So like I said, I think we got one more podcast with this book and it will be done and
[01:42:52] we'll get it out there to the world.
[01:42:54] We'll get some some version of it out there to the troops.
[01:42:59] And that way we can use this book to guide us.
[01:43:02] We'll steer us in the right direction.
[01:43:07] So echo Charles, speaking of steering us and guiding us in the right direction.
[01:43:17] Maybe we're not right direction.
[01:43:19] Maybe we're not right direction.
[01:43:20] We're not going to, when we need that remote.
[01:43:22] We're going to get up and we're going to do the right thing.
[01:43:25] We're going to get the sweat full.
[01:43:27] Yes.
[01:43:28] Solution or the solution with some sweat.
[01:43:29] We'll say.
[01:43:30] Yeah.
[01:43:31] Either way.
[01:43:32] Yes.
[01:43:33] So a path.
[01:43:34] Really?
[01:43:35] Direction.
[01:43:36] The path.
[01:43:37] Yes.
[01:43:38] She's actually.
[01:43:39] I'm not all that right now.
[01:43:41] But I'm going to set up.
[01:43:43] Okay.
[01:43:44] Yes.
[01:43:45] We're all on this path.
[01:43:47] And wise men once said path is not easy.
[01:43:54] The path is hard.
[01:43:57] Anyway.
[01:43:58] Okay. So on this path, we do need supplementation.
[01:44:02] Okay.
[01:44:03] And supplementation.
[01:44:04] And kind of you kind of forget about this where you know how like you probably will never
[01:44:10] have this problem.
[01:44:11] Maybe you do maybe not at all.
[01:44:12] But they broke maybe.
[01:44:13] So you know how like you're really used to taking.
[01:44:15] Okay.
[01:44:16] So I'm really used to taking discipline right before work comes.
[01:44:19] And if I start running low or run out panic.
[01:44:23] Yeah.
[01:44:24] Like, well, for lack of a better term, we'll say, yeah.
[01:44:28] But it's the kind like, right, if I run out, I don't know if I can work out.
[01:44:32] Of course, I'm not thinking that specifically, but that's the feeling I get, you know.
[01:44:36] But then I got to remind myself, no, no, this is all supplementation.
[01:44:39] It's help on this path.
[01:44:40] That's what all this stuff is.
[01:44:41] So just keep that in mind.
[01:44:43] Okay.
[01:44:44] All right.
[01:44:45] So anyway, with that and the reason I thought about that also another reason was this path is hard.
[01:44:52] Right.
[01:44:53] And like I just said, okay.
[01:44:54] So the other day, my wife got injured.
[01:44:56] Right.
[01:44:57] So I'm not sure if I can do it.
[01:44:58] I'm not sure if I can do it.
[01:44:59] I'm not sure, but I'm saying, I just, I don't want people worried about you.
[01:45:04] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:05] Correct.
[01:45:06] Yeah.
[01:45:07] Yeah.
[01:45:07] Some fractures on the feet, you know, whatever, you know, I had to slide in injuries that are not
[01:45:12] life changing in any negative way.
[01:45:13] For a very comfortable area.
[01:45:15] In convenience.
[01:45:17] But we're pushing through it.
[01:45:20] We're going to recover.
[01:45:21] We're going to shift some, some resources, right?
[01:45:23] Some sliding into various roles.
[01:45:25] Right.
[01:45:26] One of them is required a little bit earlier of a morning for me a lot earlier.
[01:45:31] Right.
[01:45:32] Right.
[01:45:33] Right.
[01:45:34] We were not going to go into those details, you know.
[01:45:37] But I wound out with, if I'm not mistaken, two hours of sleep, a little bit more than two
[01:45:42] hours.
[01:45:43] Like under three hours of sleep.
[01:45:44] Right.
[01:45:45] So of course, you know what that means.
[01:45:48] The workout becomes questionable.
[01:45:50] You see, I'm saying.
[01:45:52] But so I started thinking.
[01:45:54] And it has to do with what we're talking about last time where you kind of think about
[01:45:59] it like, what does it take to get this workout done?
[01:46:03] And my default is, well, obviously a long nap first.
[01:46:08] But let's say that's not available to us.
[01:46:10] When you rather just get it done, well, you know, I'd rather it be done for sure.
[01:46:16] But I don't know about the getting it part, you seem to say, when you're only on two,
[01:46:21] half hours sleep, whatever.
[01:46:22] Anyway, so I'm like, what would it take?
[01:46:24] Okay.
[01:46:25] So what if, and this is just going on, it might might.
[01:46:28] What would it be like, like, what's holding me back from actually just doing it?
[01:46:33] You know, like, what would, is there anything that would keep me from achieving that,
[01:46:38] you know, getting the workout done, some small, like such a small deal when I'm
[01:46:42] playing it out loud.
[01:46:43] But nonetheless.
[01:46:44] Yeah, I saw a video the other day of Joe Rogan and they had Joe Rogan, somebody
[01:46:49] was talking to him and they just were like, they were showing his face while the person
[01:46:53] was talking, he was thinking about like some other totally random, he wasn't paying attention.
[01:46:57] Is that how you're feeling right off the side?
[01:46:58] So just in that boat.
[01:46:59] I was just like, dude, what are you talking about?
[01:47:03] You're not trust me.
[01:47:04] Trust me.
[01:47:05] That's bringing home.
[01:47:06] It's going to have some of that.
[01:47:07] Bring it home.
[01:47:08] No, I'm telling you this, I have something to tell you.
[01:47:10] Okay.
[01:47:11] So I wind up just concluding that.
[01:47:16] I ended up concluding that, okay.
[01:47:19] Dave's got to look at the scary thing is Dave's face.
[01:47:23] He's going to rock in his face.
[01:47:24] He's really trying to stay with you.
[01:47:27] Yeah, he's staying with me because he knows that he's going to be able to use this.
[01:47:31] Okay.
[01:47:32] Let me get over here.
[01:47:33] All right.
[01:47:34] So anyway, I'm like, okay, technically there's nothing keeping me from getting
[01:47:39] this work up done, even though it seems like a real painful idea right now.
[01:47:43] Is there anything keeping you forgetting this story done?
[01:47:46] The actual content of the story.
[01:47:48] So Barry, you should incorporate this mindset into right now.
[01:47:51] Okay.
[01:47:52] I can finish it if I don't start it.
[01:47:54] Okay.
[01:47:55] Anyway, the answer ended up to be nothing aside from me very much not being in the mood
[01:48:02] to I had convinced myself that I need a certain amount of sleep to get a workout done
[01:48:06] on an individual level.
[01:48:07] It's not true.
[01:48:08] Not true.
[01:48:09] So it's kind of like, okay, it's kind of a form of realizing that you kind of have
[01:48:13] mental toughness in a way.
[01:48:15] Okay.
[01:48:16] Like realizing it, not invoking it, just realizing it and then you can use it.
[01:48:21] So I got the workout done.
[01:48:23] Okay.
[01:48:24] All right.
[01:48:25] What also what that did, what that did also is set the precedent.
[01:48:32] There I was.
[01:48:33] They did it was going nowhere.
[01:48:36] It set the precedent for it.
[01:48:38] If that happens again, you just automatically know.
[01:48:41] You seem saying, okay.
[01:48:42] Rather than trying to deep deep.
[01:48:43] You don't have to dig deep.
[01:48:44] You just gotta realize some stuff sometimes.
[01:48:47] This is what I'm saying.
[01:48:48] Roger.
[01:48:49] Anyway.
[01:48:50] So you can do the supplementation when you're doing these things, whether you're
[01:48:53] out of discipline or not, this is all supplementation.
[01:48:57] You do the workout, you take the supplementation.
[01:49:00] It's like you ever play that game super off-road.
[01:49:02] You play that game?
[01:49:03] No.
[01:49:04] No.
[01:49:05] It's like a game like you race, a truck.
[01:49:09] For real, it makes sense.
[01:49:10] You race in a truck and then if you win, you get credits where you can buy like acceleration
[01:49:16] or speed or traction or whatever.
[01:49:20] That's what every one of these supplements is.
[01:49:23] Okay.
[01:49:24] You seem saying, got the discipline for your mind, for your body, got
[01:49:27] won't for the protein, you know, all these things.
[01:49:30] So if you get them all, like you have the full decked out routine for the path,
[01:49:35] this is what I'm saying.
[01:49:36] So a bunch of things.
[01:49:37] Join warfare.
[01:49:38] Super cruel.
[01:49:39] Discipline.
[01:49:40] Vitamin B.
[01:49:42] Cold War.
[01:49:43] Malk.
[01:49:44] Yeah, but smashing Pumpkin Malk, which has to be just brought up because...
[01:49:49] Yeah, it's good.
[01:49:51] But you gotta include what Malk is, Malk is, though.
[01:49:55] Protein.
[01:49:56] Don't they really know that now?
[01:49:58] Kind of.
[01:49:59] I mean, this is the first lesson.
[01:50:00] You're so realistic.
[01:50:02] They know every time.
[01:50:04] I think you're actually incorrect on that.
[01:50:06] I think that, that your opinion is factually incorrect on that.
[01:50:09] I feel like there was a value there.
[01:50:11] Okay.
[01:50:12] Would there something value there or no?
[01:50:17] Do you think there was some value?
[01:50:20] Yes, I'm...
[01:50:21] I gotta be honest with you.
[01:50:23] I'm kind of over here thinking there's a little bit of a conflict in what you're saying.
[01:50:27] Okay.
[01:50:28] Because what I would think is, if I was on two hours of sleep, man, and like, look, the soon
[01:50:32] I'd get this...
[01:50:33] Soon I get in, the soon I get out, and you're in complete control of that situation.
[01:50:38] And it's kind of the situation we're in right now, I was like, bro, if there's anybody
[01:50:41] at all of getting through the support phase, it's you.
[01:50:45] Bro, you can jam through this.
[01:50:48] Well, much like you did that workout.
[01:50:50] Well, respectfully, I don't think this phase is the part you just jam through as it were.
[01:50:56] You know, this is important information.
[01:50:58] I don't know.
[01:50:59] I think it is.
[01:51:00] Do you think it is?
[01:51:01] Fair enough.
[01:51:02] All right. Well, it's not jam through it.
[01:51:03] I don't know.
[01:51:04] I don't know.
[01:51:05] Cool.
[01:51:05] Can we get through it?
[01:51:06] Thanks, everyone.
[01:51:07] That's about to press stop.
[01:51:08] Thank you for listening.
[01:51:11] Okay.
[01:51:12] All right.
[01:51:13] Thanks for the support.
[01:51:14] Okay.
[01:51:15] Look, Jock, if you want to be invited back onto the podcast, you can
[01:51:18] bear with me.
[01:51:19] Anyway, supplement joint stuff, joint warfare, super-cryl oil.
[01:51:23] This is for you joints.
[01:51:25] Vitamin D3, Cold War Immunity, also other benefits.
[01:51:30] Discipline, discipline, go for your mind, and your body everyday, take down one.
[01:51:35] It'll help you. Trust me. It'll help you.
[01:51:38] Energy drink, discipline, go RTD, energy drink, healthy, legitimately, factually healthy.
[01:51:44] Real energy, real energy, not like am I up for two hours and now we're looking for real energy.
[01:51:52] Clean energy.
[01:51:53] And this sounds kind of odd, but there's no poisonous elements in there.
[01:52:01] Yeah.
[01:52:02] So you need to have to say that until you look at some other energy.
[01:52:07] Things out there that do have places out there.
[01:52:10] That may or may not have places out there.
[01:52:12] Or things that can be considered poisonous.
[01:52:15] Yeah.
[01:52:16] So, you know, there is that. So it's a big deal.
[01:52:19] Boom, continuing on the list, MOC, dessert in the form of a protein.
[01:52:22] All kinds of flavors, including, but not limited to smashing pumpkin, which is inspired by pumpkin spice.
[01:52:30] Yeah. It is fall at the moment. Hey, listen, we just real quick.
[01:52:34] When you talked about maybe some other, let's call them energy drinks broadly.
[01:52:41] Right now we're experiencing some conflict.
[01:52:45] Some people might even say acts of war have been, have transpired in this category.
[01:52:54] So we may need to go, well, we will retow it.
[01:52:58] We are retaliating the best way. If you want to help retaliate, and you happen to at this time, when is it?
[01:53:06] If you're alive right now, if you're, it is November 2020.
[01:53:14] We are rolling, we are in wall wash stores in Florida.
[01:53:19] If you're there, and you want to help win the war that we are engaged in at this time, go to wall
[01:53:25] wall, in Florida, and you get yourself a bunch of jacquadissipling go to help us defeat the enemy.
[01:53:37] Thank you. You can also get a vitamin shop. If you're not in Florida, you can also get it at originmain.com.
[01:53:45] You can also get it. You can get it on Amazon. Straight up.
[01:53:49] Also, forgot to mention, Jacco White Tea, Tea Begs, and Cance, by the way. Again, this is supplementation.
[01:53:58] Right? You're on the path with or without this. Now you got the supplementation.
[01:54:02] You got the full decked out vehicle on the path. Good to go. You do all these things.
[01:54:09] You're off to a good start. Hey, hey, speaking of flavors, by the way, you mentioned smashing pumpkin.
[01:54:16] Yeah. We have another flavor that's been released into the wild. Yeah. Okay. Dave Burke. What's the new flavor?
[01:54:23] Why don't you tell us the discipline go? Yes.
[01:54:26] flavor. Afterburner Orange. And this is Dave Burke's signature flavor indeed it is.
[01:54:36] So, we this came from when you were a child. You liked to drink orange soda of some kind.
[01:54:42] We're not talking about brands. You have replicated that flavor.
[01:54:47] Now is it a little bit because discipline go traditionally is not Serapy sweet. Right?
[01:54:54] It's not sugar. It doesn't have that taste. So, did you is a lighter form of one of these former
[01:55:01] or an orange drinks that you use by design? It's actually supposed to kind of make you remember what it tastes like.
[01:55:06] Well, that is tasting like you're drinking a pile of sugar.
[01:55:10] Cool. And that's exactly what it does. It's a little more refreshing. It is refreshing. It is cleaner.
[01:55:15] But due to it is it is good. So, there you go. If you want to support well, if you want to support afterburner Orange,
[01:55:24] if you want to support Dave Burke. Good deal to yes, that's the one.
[01:55:28] Is it say good deal Dave on the can? It does. This is a good deal.
[01:55:32] Man, you're off to good start. It's cool that anyone can go back in time and witness the creation of the nickname good deal Dave.
[01:55:39] It's pretty, that's kind of cool. Very, very cool. I think it's kind of cool.
[01:55:44] All right. Sorry up. What else?
[01:55:46] Oh, I didn't jam through that man. It was really good. Thank you.
[01:55:49] Yeah. It kind of is my jam. It was one might say.

[01:59:36] Some people like to watch video rather than just audio.
[01:59:39] Maybe more immersive. You know, we got our smart TVs, projectors, whatever the case may be.
[01:59:44] Anyway, we do have a YouTube channel also some excerpts on there.
[01:59:48] If you need these messages in smaller, what do you say, doses?
[01:59:52] Mm.
[01:59:53] Not doses. That's not the correct word.
[01:59:55] It seems to work.
[01:59:56] Smaller.
[02:00:00] Cut up clips. Anyway, some excerpts on there.
[02:00:01] Anyway, this is work better than cut up.
[02:00:03] There you go. Boom. There you go. Those is according to Jockel.
[02:00:06] Anyway, yeah, it's on there. Real easy to find YouTube.
[02:00:08] There it is. Boom. YouTube channel subscribe on that one.
[02:00:12] Also psychological warfare. If you have any moments of weakness, two hours of sleep or otherwise.
[02:00:17] If you just in the mood to skip a workout.
[02:00:20] I got three hours of sleep last night.
[02:00:22] Yeah, but you don't count with this sleep thing.
[02:00:25] I said, I said, what I said.
[02:00:27] You're like, yeah, the end point.
[02:00:29] Here's the end.
[02:00:30] What's in Somni. Here's the end Somni.
[02:00:32] Here's what in Somni is like for me.
[02:00:35] My mind isn't a roller coaster.
[02:00:37] Well, I was a roller coaster, but I'm going down tracks.
[02:00:40] And every, like every thought I have, it's just a right turn left turn.
[02:00:44] And I'm just, I, it's just, my mind is just racing.
[02:00:48] Yeah.
[02:00:48] And I'm going this, thinking that, thinking another thing.
[02:00:50] And there's no possible way I can go to sleep.
[02:00:52] There's no possible way I can go to sleep.
[02:00:54] And so I was up into, around.
[02:00:57] It was like, it was like 1808.
[02:01:00] The last time I looked at the clock.
[02:01:02] Mm.
[02:01:03] And then the alarm clock went off.
[02:01:06] So like you fell asleep.
[02:01:08] Didn't realize you fell asleep in by the time.
[02:01:10] Yeah, so we're just somewhere after 1808.
[02:01:14] I fell asleep.
[02:01:17] And then the alarm clock went off.
[02:01:19] You got to have time.
[02:01:20] You got to have time.
[02:01:21] I'm going to get that.
[02:01:25] I'll get that sometimes that that's actually pretty good description.
[02:01:27] I'll get that sometimes.
[02:01:29] But not before I go to sleep, it'll be like,
[02:01:31] I'll wake up at not quote, I'm quote middle of the night.
[02:01:33] And that'll happen.
[02:01:35] And I can't go back sleep.
[02:01:37] And it gets to the point where I'm like, bro, I just got like 25 more minutes.
[02:01:40] I almost got up.
[02:01:42] I almost got up at midnight and just went to work out.
[02:01:44] I probably should have.
[02:01:45] In fact, I should have.
[02:01:46] But I can't think it's right there.
[02:01:48] Like maybe over the ground.
[02:01:49] Maybe around this next corner is.
[02:01:50] It'll be a little while.
[02:01:51] Maybe it's just there.
[02:01:52] Some waiting for it waiting for it.
[02:01:53] And the longer you're trying to wait for it, the harder it is to come around.
[02:01:56] So yeah, that's a debate for sure.
[02:01:59] And then I had a bad, no, I had a dream.
[02:02:01] I had a bad dream.
[02:02:03] I had a dream the other night.
[02:02:05] I'm in like somewhere, some foreign country.
[02:02:09] And something happens.
[02:02:13] And we like get the call like, hey, we got to go right now.
[02:02:16] And so I run to get my gear.
[02:02:18] I pick up my gear and my magazines are not loaded.
[02:02:21] And the helicopter's coming into like, take us to do whatever we got to do.
[02:02:24] There's guys in trouble.
[02:02:25] The helicopter comes in and I'm sitting there loading mags as fast as I can.
[02:02:29] And then I'm running.
[02:02:31] And I see the helicopter leaving with like my guys on board and it's leaving.
[02:02:36] And I missed it.
[02:02:37] Like they had to go.
[02:02:39] And, bro, I mean, I was just like feeling sick.
[02:02:42] And I woke up and it took me, you know, whatever.
[02:02:45] Ten seconds to realize that it didn't really happen.
[02:02:49] And so I had the worst feeling ever.
[02:02:51] And then five seconds later, I'm like super thankful.
[02:02:54] And then I'm bummed out again because it happened.
[02:02:57] You were brave.
[02:02:58] No, right, that makes sense.
[02:02:59] I was gonna like kind of tease you whatever.
[02:03:01] You're like, we're talking about.
[02:03:02] But I said I can dream.
[02:03:04] Not with that kind of stuff.
[02:03:05] Obviously, but it was with football games.
[02:03:06] Like I'm like trying to make it to the football game or whatever.
[02:03:09] And then I can like hear on the radio.
[02:03:11] It's like half time.
[02:03:12] You know, that's where you're into the first quarter.
[02:03:13] And I'm like, not even at the game yet.
[02:03:15] And it's like, you know, it's third quarter.
[02:03:17] And I get there in the game is like finishing.
[02:03:19] Two.
[02:03:20] We never would have anticipated in one million years that you had some kind of anxiety about being late for it.
[02:03:25] In the end.
[02:03:26] Yeah.
[02:03:27] Okay.
[02:03:28] Yeah.
[02:03:29] Well, hey, maybe there's some circular thing that kind of makes it all makes sense.
[02:03:38] You know, I don't know.
[02:03:39] No, no.
[02:03:41] Psychological warfare.
[02:03:42] I was going to, okay, we got to explain what it is.
[02:03:44] And again, back to the one.
[02:03:46] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:47] Some people there.
[02:03:48] Anyway, get to our sleep.
[02:03:49] Get eight hours.
