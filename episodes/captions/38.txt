00:02:28.56 --> 00:02:49.12 Good evening echo. Good evening. That's a poem. That's a poem called Infantry Colombs
00:02:49.12 --> 00:03:02.64 by Kippling. Who we've actually read before on the podcast. He was a British correspondent. He was an
00:03:02.64 --> 00:03:12.000 author. He was a poet. He was a patriot. A British patriot. And he was actually also critical of war
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.68 and paraphrased from a book by a guy named David Gilmore, the long recessional. The imperial life
00:03:23.68 --> 00:03:29.84 of Richard Kippling. Kippling was deeply critical of how the war was fought and by the way
00:03:29.84 --> 00:03:34.16 he's talking about World War One of how the war was fought by the British Army as opposed to the war
00:03:34.16 --> 00:03:42.48 itself, which is kind of like hackworth. Hackworth was more opposed to the way we were fighting
00:03:42.48 --> 00:03:50.64 in Vietnam than he was opposed to the actual war itself. And he complained as early. This is Kippling
00:03:50.64 --> 00:03:55.52 complain as early as October of 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now.
00:03:56.40 --> 00:04:02.56 And something must be wrong with the British Army. Kippling was shocked by the heavy losses
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:09.84 that the British Expeditionary Force had taken by the autumn of 1914 and blamed the entire pre-war
00:04:09.84 --> 00:04:17.36 generation of British politicians who he had argued failed to learn the lessons of the Boer War
00:04:18.40 --> 00:04:24.32 and as a result thousands and thousands of British soldiers were paying with their lives
00:04:24.32 --> 00:04:35.60 for failures in the fields. And so there's some definite complexities to Kippling and it
00:04:35.60 --> 00:04:40.56 actually goes a little bit further and deeper with these complexities and there's a reason I
00:04:40.56 --> 00:04:54.48 started off with that poem. And that poem it is pretty much attributed that the idea of that poem
00:04:54.48 --> 00:05:00.80 which is obviously about marching long distances and it's attributed to a series of forced
00:05:00.80 --> 00:05:10.48 marches that were led by in the Boer War which were led by field martial lord Frederick Roberts who
00:05:10.48 --> 00:05:17.76 led 60,000 men on forced marches during the second Boer War in South Africa. He led these forced
00:05:17.76 --> 00:05:22.80 marches that were almost a thousand miles, nine hundred and fifty miles from Cape Down to Transvaul.
00:05:24.08 --> 00:05:29.76 And so that's kind of where this this poem comes from about how madening it is to march
00:05:29.76 --> 00:05:36.08 and how hard it is. But the interesting the other interesting piece of this is that Lord
00:05:36.08 --> 00:05:43.20 Robert, Lord Roberts who led this march was actually personal friends with Kippling. They were
00:05:43.20 --> 00:05:53.36 close friends and Lord Roberts was commander and chief of the army during World War I.
00:05:53.36 --> 00:06:06.32 And at Kippling's request at Rutt your Kippling's request, Lord Roberts allowed Kippling's son
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:13.36 to be admitted to join the Irish guard he had some kind of a health problem. And so Kippling
00:06:13.36 --> 00:06:17.04 rid your Kippling called him up and said, hey my son's got a little health issue but he needs to
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:24.40 get in the game. And Lord Roberts worked it out, you know commander and chief of the army and got him
00:06:24.40 --> 00:06:32.000 him admitted to the Irish guard. It was actually his eyesight he had poor eyesight. And so the
00:06:34.08 --> 00:06:38.40 the horrible piece I guess of that is that as I've mentioned the first time
00:06:38.40 --> 00:06:48.48 we read a Kippling poem on here is that read your Kippling son John Kippling was killed
00:06:49.60 --> 00:06:58.32 at September of 1915 the battle allus were the British suffered 60,000 casualties
00:06:58.32 --> 00:07:10.64 in three weeks of fighting 60,000 casualties. His body was never identified and he is one of the
00:07:10.64 --> 00:07:20.24 20,000 British dead that are corrupt commemorated by the loose memorial. And while his body was never
00:07:20.24 --> 00:07:31.20 found there were accounts that he was last seen, the slogging through the mud blindly after a
00:07:32.48 --> 00:07:45.44 violent shell explosion had ripped off his face. And there's further connections and one of the lines
00:07:45.44 --> 00:07:51.92 in the poem is that there's no discharge in the war. And this is actually from the Bible.
00:07:52.96 --> 00:08:00.24 The Kleezy Astys 8-8 says there is no man that half power over the spirit to retain the spirit.
00:08:01.12 --> 00:08:07.36 Neither half he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war.
00:08:07.36 --> 00:08:16.48 So what he's saying there is no man half powers to power over the spirit to retain spirit. Meaning
00:08:16.48 --> 00:08:20.96 you can't keep your soul. When it's time for your soul to go you can't keep it.
00:08:22.72 --> 00:08:28.000 And then neither half he power over the day of death. Obviously you have no power to overcome death
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:39.52 and there is no discharge in that war. And that is that this ultimate struggle between life and death
00:08:40.24 --> 00:08:47.28 that war that we fight for life itself. There's no escape. You can't get out of it.
00:08:47.28 --> 00:08:59.76 There is no discharge from that war. And maybe a little heavy way to start the podcast.
00:09:01.36 --> 00:09:06.72 But that poem also has a special meaning to a certain group of people in the navy and those of you
00:09:06.72 --> 00:09:13.36 that know what I'm talking about there. You know what I'm talking about there. And it's a poem
00:09:13.36 --> 00:09:22.40 that I thought of often in my career, especially when I strapped on my gear and heived on an
00:09:22.40 --> 00:09:27.52 overloaded rucksack for a long patrol or march. And when you do that,
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:36.80 any soldier or military man will tell you this that when you do that, that is one of the most
00:09:36.80 --> 00:09:44.24 demanding parts of the job, the rock march, the long patrol, the hump, little walk,
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.36 the forced road march. And even though you're with a group of people when you do that,
00:09:54.40 --> 00:10:02.96 when you're marching, you're very much alone. You're alone with your thoughts and there's
00:10:02.96 --> 00:10:06.16 things that you got to think about. You got to think about your field of fire. You got to think
00:10:06.16 --> 00:10:10.16 about your navigation. You got to think about rally points. You got to think about headcount. You got
00:10:10.16 --> 00:10:14.72 to think about terrain feature. You got to think about the enemy and booby traps and Idees and all that stuff.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:27.76 But even with that, there's still a lot of empty space to fill up inside your head. And I recently
00:10:27.76 --> 00:10:39.04 took my kids out on patrol. And I guess to be grammatically correct, it was a hike in the civilian
00:10:39.04 --> 00:10:49.76 world. But in my mind, it was a patrol. It felt like a patrol. And you know, it's the same thing.
00:10:49.76 --> 00:10:54.16 I mean, it's actually you're moving from point A to point B. You set security when you get there.
00:10:54.16 --> 00:11:00.64 You set your layout point, which civilians call like a campsite. Then you sleep and then you wake up
00:11:00.64 --> 00:11:06.88 and then you do it again. And as I did that patrol, and since it had been a while since I had
00:11:06.88 --> 00:11:14.96 done a patrol and because I was also watching my kids on their first patrol, I got to kind of revisit
00:11:14.96 --> 00:11:27.76 my little relationship that I have with patrolling over the years. And also as I saw them suffer and
00:11:27.76 --> 00:11:36.72 learn through their first patrol. I got to think into everything that I learned over the years
00:11:36.72 --> 00:11:45.60 from patrolling. And in doing that, I realized how much patrolling had taught me. So I'm there
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:50.08 walking and I'm thinking about all these things that I learned because again, when you're
00:11:50.08 --> 00:11:54.56 patrolling, you got time. Even if you're thinking about navigation, you're thinking about all these things.
00:11:54.56 --> 00:11:59.36 It doesn't matter, even every piece of the job that you're focused on, it doesn't matter
00:11:59.36 --> 00:12:02.80 it's still space to fill. And that's what happened. You know, your mind starts to think about
00:12:02.80 --> 00:12:12.40 all these things. And it dawned on me how much patrolling and marching had taught me. And how it's
00:12:12.40 --> 00:12:17.52 really a fundamental component in everything that I did in the SEAL teams and the military.
00:12:19.20 --> 00:12:24.56 And like leadership, there are some fundamental principles that apply universally to so many
00:12:24.56 --> 00:12:32.16 things in life. And also just like leadership, there's a certain aspect of patrolling and navigation
00:12:33.12 --> 00:12:41.28 that is as much art as it is science. And the science, of course, is relatively easy to teach,
00:12:42.56 --> 00:12:52.48 but the art, as always, the art is hard to teach. And finally, with this this idea of navigation
00:12:52.48 --> 00:12:58.48 of moving from point A to point B, which includes plotting a course and picking way points along
00:12:58.48 --> 00:13:05.04 the way and identifying and avoiding obstacles and route and how to overcome unexpected obstacles
00:13:05.04 --> 00:13:10.48 and how and when and where to rest and everything else that navigation and patrolling includes
00:13:10.48 --> 00:13:22.000 and all those things are things that you face as you navigate life. And as you set goals as you
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.84 establish where you're going. So I wanted to take a closer look at
00:13:30.96 --> 00:13:39.04 land navigation and how it relates to leadership and life and in digging in, I looked at,
00:13:40.24 --> 00:13:45.92 I looked at some of the information out there, some of the field manuals. And
00:13:45.92 --> 00:13:56.16 it's, it's, I learned from people, right? And I didn't learn from a book. And as I went to
00:13:56.16 --> 00:14:01.28 the books, I was coping that I could find what I had learned from people, but but I didn't really
00:14:01.28 --> 00:14:09.28 find it. I found pieces of it, glimpses of it, but nothing like what I was taught by the guys that
00:14:09.28 --> 00:14:18.72 raised me in the seal teams. And you know, I looked up the Army FM 3-Tect25.26 map reading and land navigation.
00:14:19.44 --> 00:14:27.44 And it's a thorough document and it's very heavy on the scientific side, the actual technical
00:14:27.44 --> 00:14:32.48 skill of it, how to set declination in a compass and how to orient the map and what the contour
00:14:32.48 --> 00:14:36.96 line, all the basic tools are in there. And there's some good quotes. One of the quotes it said,
00:14:36.96 --> 00:14:43.44 today the complexities of tactical operations and deployment of troops are such that it is essential
00:14:43.44 --> 00:14:48.72 for all soldiers to be able to read and interpret their maps in order to move quickly and effectively
00:14:48.72 --> 00:14:52.88 on the battlefield. Okay, I can't argue with that. You got to know where you are and if you ever
00:14:52.88 --> 00:15:00.48 heard me say this, I always used to ask the young, the young seal officers, what's the most important
00:15:00.48 --> 00:15:05.28 piece of information you need on the battlefield. And they would say, where the bad guys are,
00:15:05.28 --> 00:15:09.36 or how many guys you have, or how many enemy there are, or anything like that. They'd have a
00:15:09.36 --> 00:15:14.48 bunch of different ideas. And I would say, no, no, no, no, no. The most important piece of information
00:15:14.48 --> 00:15:20.32 you can have on the battlefield is where you are. You got to know where you are. Otherwise nothing
00:15:20.32 --> 00:15:27.60 else matters. And then I looked at a book called The Last Hundred Yards, which we actually covered
00:15:27.60 --> 00:15:34.64 on this podcast, podcast number three. And it goes through a section which is describing, it's
00:15:34.64 --> 00:15:42.72 talking about GPS and how now we've got GPS's and the GPS's can be unreliable and you can't
00:15:42.72 --> 00:15:46.96 count on them and all this stuff. And that's kind of true. It was even more true when that book
00:15:46.96 --> 00:15:51.20 came out, which was in 1995 and there was less satellites in the sky and the GPS received
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:55.60 versus more and is good in the encryption methodology wasn't so dialed in yet. So the GPS is
00:15:55.60 --> 00:16:02.56 a were less accurate back then and they were also still pretty big. They were these big
00:16:02.56 --> 00:16:12.24 contraptions and even in 1993, 1994 the GPS is that I carried were big heavy things. Basically
00:16:12.24 --> 00:16:21.20 you had to assign a person to carry them. And now of course they're tiny. Everybody's got a GPS
00:16:21.20 --> 00:16:25.84 and you're on your iPhone or whatever smartphone you're using that or a thousand times better
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:32.08 than the one I used to carry on my back. And they're also very accurate and reliable now in the
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:40.96 military's come to rely heavily on them. Perhaps, perhaps a little too much. And I'm not going
00:16:40.96 --> 00:16:45.36 to be a guy that's like a stick in the mud that says hey don't evolve, don't learn anything
00:16:45.36 --> 00:16:51.76 because technology's awesome and you have to take advantage of it. But I also do think there's
00:16:51.76 --> 00:17:01.52 a need to remember the old ways. And I remember when GPS first came out and I was coming into the
00:17:01.52 --> 00:17:06.80 seal team and I had this thing. And I remember this, this officers, this officers, particularly
00:17:06.80 --> 00:17:12.96 said to me you know, hey all I need to do is we need to do is carry this thing and you know we'll
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:19.12 know exactly where we are at all times. And he hands me this you know 20 pound brick but big box
00:17:19.12 --> 00:17:25.44 thing. And I kind of said hey man all I need to do is carry this map and compass and I'll know exactly
00:17:25.44 --> 00:17:34.48 where I am at all times. It's called land navigation. I want to learn it. But nowadays the GPS is
00:17:34.48 --> 00:17:41.52 our awesome and we definitely rely heavily on them. But it is, it is piece of the last hundred yards
00:17:41.52 --> 00:17:49.52 that definitely emphasizes that you have to know how to land now, which is good. But like I said,
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:56.24 when I look through these books none of them gave me the same clear level of instruction that I learned
00:17:56.24 --> 00:18:07.44 about land navigation at patrolling when I first got into the teams back in the day. And again,
00:18:07.44 --> 00:18:12.16 these instructions and this methodology and some of these basic principles of patrolling and land
00:18:12.16 --> 00:18:19.76 nav they stuck with me and are really fundamental building blocks of how I ended up doing everything that I do.
00:18:21.52 --> 00:18:30.88 And they're really the basis of the attitude that I had that was very beneficial in leading
00:18:31.68 --> 00:18:39.20 me to having success in other areas, which was awesome. And so again here I am and taking my kids
00:18:39.20 --> 00:18:44.08 on their first patrol that made me realize this so clearly. And as I was thinking about it,
00:18:44.08 --> 00:18:49.84 I was like, I'm going to talk about this on the podcast. Because these are lessons that I learned
00:18:49.84 --> 00:18:54.24 that I actually forgot that I learned. You know what I mean? These are lessons that are so embedded
00:18:55.04 --> 00:18:58.88 that I forgot that I thought about them. But I think about them all the time. And then I'm seeing
00:18:58.88 --> 00:19:04.48 my kids do this. I'm thinking, oh yeah, they're there. They're learning this right now for the first
00:19:04.48 --> 00:19:13.76 time. And so to go through some of those things, some of those principles, the first one is planning.
00:19:15.04 --> 00:19:19.12 And you know, we, this gets, of course everyone knows you got to come up with a plan.
00:19:20.08 --> 00:19:27.84 But do in a detailed map study and identifying the obstacles that you're going to have to get around.
00:19:27.84 --> 00:19:32.24 And there's a couple different methods that you can use for land navigation. One of them is called
00:19:32.24 --> 00:19:37.52 dead reckoning. And dead reckoning means you get a compass bearing. From point A to point B is,
00:19:37.52 --> 00:19:42.32 you know, you're going to be traveling on 270 degrees. So you put your compass on 270 degrees
00:19:42.32 --> 00:19:48.88 and you march. You go straight line. Don't let anything take you off that line. Head down and go.
00:19:48.88 --> 00:19:54.40 And that's called dead reckoning. And that's obviously can be very problematic. Because if in
00:19:54.40 --> 00:19:58.80 between you and where you're going is a giant mountain or you know, a bunch of rivers or whatever
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:02.32 you're going to have to go through all those things and you're going to get worn out, you're
00:20:02.32 --> 00:20:08.88 tired, you might be not tactically advisable to go through those areas. And so the better form
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.72 is called terrain Nav or terrain association. And when you're doing that, you actually look at
00:20:16.72 --> 00:20:22.40 the map and you study what the ground is going to do. And so if there's a big mountain, you can
00:20:22.40 --> 00:20:26.000 screw around the bottom of the mountain and you get to the side of the mountain and there's a
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.56 ravine that's you can follow that ravine around till you get to a certain point on the ravine where
00:20:30.56 --> 00:20:35.44 it cuts far to the north and you can you can head any other direction towards your turn. So it's
00:20:35.44 --> 00:20:41.36 this, it's a method of really knowing the terrain that you're going to be on. And it's infinitely
00:20:41.36 --> 00:20:46.40 more effective than dead reckoning. So if you think about this from my perspective over you have
00:20:46.40 --> 00:20:50.40 a mission that you're trying to get done. Well, how are you going to get there? You know, how
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:57.20 are you going to get this mission done? Are you going to just put your head down and absorb any
00:20:57.20 --> 00:21:02.72 impact that you take and apply more pressure? Or are you going to be smart? Are you going to study
00:21:02.72 --> 00:21:09.12 the terrain and take a look and figure out the best way around those obstacles?
00:21:11.60 --> 00:21:19.04 Those dead reckoning and terrain association, the terrain association, you don't like, let's
00:21:19.04 --> 00:21:23.12 say go around the mountain and then try to get back on the dead reckoning course. You're just using
00:21:23.12 --> 00:21:27.68 the terrain. Your brain is the terrain level. You'll know when you do your map study,
00:21:28.56 --> 00:21:32.000 you'll know that you're going to go skirt around this mountain. You're going to go down a
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.96 ravine, then you're going to cut over by this open field. You're going to hold along the wood
00:21:36.96 --> 00:21:41.60 lines. When you get to the end of the wood line, there's going to be a fence. You're going to
00:21:41.60 --> 00:21:45.76 step over that fence once you get to the fence. You're going to follow the fence for, you know,
00:21:45.76 --> 00:21:53.44 until you hit another big terrain feature like another hill. Then you're going to follow the
00:21:53.44 --> 00:21:58.80 base of that hill until you get to a stream. You're going to know exactly where you're going the
00:21:58.80 --> 00:22:02.16 whole time. You're going to imagine how much more effective this is. You don't have to look at
00:22:02.16 --> 00:22:07.36 your compass. You are taking advantage. You're going to patrol in areas where you have a tactical
00:22:07.36 --> 00:22:13.36 advantage too. It's just a much, much better way to do things. A lot of times I think people
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:21.84 know they hear the big, the big Navy seal. Like, oh, we're just going to get it done.
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:26.08 Yes, they just stay on the course, right? Well, staying on the course means I'm going to reach my
00:22:26.08 --> 00:22:32.64 objective. It doesn't mean I'm going to power my head into the wall without thinking. So
00:22:33.84 --> 00:22:39.20 that's what terrain features do for you. And there's also some terrain features that are
00:22:39.20 --> 00:22:46.80 interesting. You can use reference points that keep you from going too far. So you can know,
00:22:46.80 --> 00:22:51.28 hey, if we hit this main highway, we went too far. We know we missed our target. We missed our turn.
00:22:51.28 --> 00:22:55.04 If we hit this river, we know we went too far. If we hit this ridge line, we know we hit
00:22:55.04 --> 00:23:00.24 too far. So you're going to set those up for you. And they're going to confirm where you are
00:23:01.12 --> 00:23:04.96 and also you're going to use those as reference points. So you're going to tell your whole team.
00:23:04.96 --> 00:23:11.60 So your whole team is going to know, hey, we made it this far. Oh, there's the big river that
00:23:11.60 --> 00:23:16.88 we're turning left at. Okay, we turned left. That's awesome. Next, we're going to hit is a wood bind.
00:23:16.88 --> 00:23:23.28 Oh, here's the wood bind. So everybody knows. And so imagine if you're, again, think about this
00:23:23.28 --> 00:23:28.88 outside the, the parameters of land navigation and patrolling. Think of it in a regular business
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:32.96 or any situation when you're trying to get a team to do something. If you lay out the course
00:23:32.96 --> 00:23:36.88 for them and you plot out what the obstacles are and you explain to people where they're going to be
00:23:36.88 --> 00:23:41.60 and how, how important it is that they need to get there and what we need to be looking out for.
00:23:41.60 --> 00:23:46.88 Imagine how the team feels. The team knows where they are. They understand where they are.
00:23:46.88 --> 00:23:50.48 When you're doing dead reckoning, the back of the, the guys in the back, they have no idea where
00:23:50.48 --> 00:23:54.40 they are. I've been that guy. I've been that guy in the back of the of a patrol and you just have
00:23:54.40 --> 00:23:58.40 no idea where you are. You have no idea how much further to go. You just got your head down.
00:23:58.40 --> 00:24:03.84 You're, you're slugging along with your weight and it's a nightmare. Whereas I've been on good
00:24:03.84 --> 00:24:07.76 patrols when I'm in the back, but we got a really good brief and I'm like, oh, there's that mountain.
00:24:07.76 --> 00:24:11.52 Oh, there's that ravine. Okay, where should be coming at that stream soon? Oh, yes, we're at the
00:24:11.52 --> 00:24:15.92 stream. So you know where you are and when you provide your team with that kind of clarity
00:24:15.92 --> 00:24:20.24 on the course that you're planning to take, it's going to make them so much more aware of what's
00:24:20.24 --> 00:24:24.08 happening and the more aware they are of what's happening. The better performance you're going to get from them.
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:32.24 Yeah. The other thing is as you're doing this, you do something called a pace count, which is
00:24:32.24 --> 00:24:38.48 your as you walk, you know how many paces it takes you to get 100 yards. And there's some
00:24:38.48 --> 00:24:42.56 Kentucky windages there as a walk when we're going uphill or downhill, you can, you can work
00:24:42.56 --> 00:24:47.12 out these different, but you can get pretty accurate. So you can know that, hey, when I take
00:24:47.12 --> 00:24:50.88 left, when my left foot hits the ground, on average, when I'm wearing a hundred pounds,
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:56.56 it's 86 paces from the average one hundred yards. So that's, that's, you'll know that. And so
00:24:56.56 --> 00:25:01.20 then what you're doing is you're constantly checking, it gives you another, it gives you another
00:25:01.20 --> 00:25:10.08 reference point because if we're supposed to hit, you know, a stream in 300 yards and I know we've
00:25:10.08 --> 00:25:15.28 marked 600 yards, something happened, time for me to stop. In fact, at 400 yards, I'm probably
00:25:15.28 --> 00:25:19.20 going to stop and say, okay, let's do a quick map study. So you want to double check these things
00:25:19.20 --> 00:25:23.36 in a business world. This could be some kind of a timeline that you set up. So you're like, hey,
00:25:23.36 --> 00:25:29.68 at, you know, 42 days, we should be here on this project. Oh, we're not there yet. Okay,
00:25:29.68 --> 00:25:36.32 what's the problem? What did we miss? Why aren't we getting it done? So that gives you two sort of
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:41.60 methodologies to confirm where you are, so you can triangulate your position, which is smart.
00:25:41.60 --> 00:25:46.32 Wait, when you call it Kentucky what? Kentucky windage. What does that mean? It's like the
00:25:46.32 --> 00:25:52.08 give or take? It's, you know, it's just, it comes from shooting. Okay, and you would normally
00:25:52.08 --> 00:25:58.64 dial in your site to get you specifically. Let's say you, you think 600 meters, but then there's a
00:25:58.64 --> 00:26:03.12 strong wind blowing. So maybe you're going to hold off to the left of the windy and Kentucky or something.
00:26:04.40 --> 00:26:10.16 I think it's just shooting. The, the, maybe the shooters in Kentucky had a, they made it. They
00:26:10.16 --> 00:26:15.84 were real accurate. So they had a whole little Kentucky wind got a commentate for that. Yeah, got you.
00:26:15.84 --> 00:26:21.36 Chicago windage. No. No. Well, because it's kind of windy, you know, so yeah, I see you're
00:26:21.36 --> 00:26:29.12 coming from, but no. It's, it's, it's Kentucky windage. It's my brozinho. Pretty dope. So,
00:26:30.80 --> 00:26:35.60 like I said in life, plan, study the route that you're going to go, think about the obstacles,
00:26:35.60 --> 00:26:40.08 how are you going to avoid them, what do your goals look like, what do your smaller goals look like,
00:26:40.08 --> 00:26:44.32 along the way, the little reference points. So you got some of you signs of the big project.
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:48.000 Okay, what are the little things? Or you got something in your life that you're trying to accomplish?
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.52 What are the little goals you're going to set for yourself to you and get to keep a reference point
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:56.000 along the way? And what's the timeline you're going to meet those on? Yep. That's how you stay on track.
00:26:57.04 --> 00:27:02.56 And you know what, we actually did. We did something called pace notes. And what pace notes were,
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:11.52 and I learned it for, for foot patrols. And we ended up using it even more when it came to vehicle
00:27:11.52 --> 00:27:16.48 patrols. And I realized that, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago or something, we started sending
00:27:16.48 --> 00:27:23.04 guys to a rally driving school. So I could learn how to drive rally racing cars. And that's,
00:27:23.04 --> 00:27:28.48 that's been the way they always done pace notes in rally racing. So you, so what's cool about it is
00:27:28.48 --> 00:27:32.32 when you do pace notes, you're writing down specifically, this is the terrain feature,
00:27:32.32 --> 00:27:35.52 this is what I'm seeing, this is how far away it is. This is the next terrain feature,
00:27:35.52 --> 00:27:39.20 this is what I'm going to see, this is how far away it is. So you can actually track that. Now,
00:27:39.20 --> 00:27:46.24 we got so detailed with that on vehicle mount patrols. We would actually just take the map and
00:27:46.24 --> 00:27:52.24 blow the map up so we'd see exactly what it looked like at that intersection or at that juncture or
00:27:52.24 --> 00:27:55.92 at that city block so we could see what the buildings look like so we'd be looking for it.
00:27:57.12 --> 00:28:01.84 So that's pace notes and it, and it, it's almost like a rehearsal, you know, it's almost like a rehearsal
00:28:01.84 --> 00:28:06.08 because you can, you can walk the whole team through and they can get a visualization of what
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:12.16 they're going to see and how it's going to look. And the other, the other piece is that I said,
00:28:12.16 --> 00:28:15.76 is you've got to share that plan and explain it to everybody so every time the same sheet.
00:28:16.88 --> 00:28:21.44 And, and I did this, what I explained to my kids, you know what I said, okay, here's what we're going
00:28:21.44 --> 00:28:24.64 to see. We're at this area here. We're going to go across some flat ground. We're going to start
00:28:24.64 --> 00:28:27.60 hitting some little terrain features here. It's going to go up and down and up and down. That's
00:28:27.60 --> 00:28:33.68 going to tell us that we're here. And, not only does it help them, no, it's going on, but now I'm talking
00:28:33.68 --> 00:28:37.92 through it. And that helps me because it helps to teach things because when you teach something,
00:28:37.92 --> 00:28:42.96 you become more proficient at it. That's one of the good things about teaching anything. You know,
00:28:42.96 --> 00:28:46.32 you want to get better at something, teach people how to do it. It makes you better. You want to teach
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:49.60 that arm lock or you want to get better at the arm lock, teach the arm lock, you'll notice all kinds
00:28:49.60 --> 00:28:53.52 little details about it. But it's so hard to teach. Like if you're not used to teaching,
00:28:53.52 --> 00:28:56.80 you should jump in there and teach because you're just used to doing it. And a lot of that stuff
00:28:56.80 --> 00:29:00.96 you just do without thinking about, okay, what exactly am I doing in this detail? You just do it.
00:29:00.96 --> 00:29:05.52 Let me, you know, muscle memory. And like, this is all these little factors that facilitate you
00:29:05.52 --> 00:29:09.52 doing something that you don't even think about. And then try to teach you, you're like, oh, you kind of
00:29:09.52 --> 00:29:13.12 do this. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, you know, you didn't even know what you're saying. You know,
00:29:13.12 --> 00:29:17.12 Greg Train always throws out little details. Like, oh, that's a good little right. Yeah. That I,
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:21.84 and he has something that I do, but once he points it out or teaches it, he'll be teaching
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:27.04 something basic that I know and I'm good at. Yeah. And he'll say, oh, yeah, I did. I put my foot on the
00:29:27.04 --> 00:29:31.76 hip here to stabilize this and I go, oh, I do that. But when you start thinking about it and you
00:29:31.76 --> 00:29:37.28 focus on it, it makes you that much better at it. And that's the same thing that's going to happen
00:29:37.28 --> 00:29:42.64 here. When you actually brief your team and tell them exactly what to expect. Now again, this doesn't
00:29:42.64 --> 00:29:45.36 mean that you're going to say, hey, this is what exactly how it's going to go because you got to
00:29:45.36 --> 00:29:49.28 give the caveat that, hey, this is our plan. I worried about how to deviate from this plan. And that's
00:29:49.28 --> 00:29:55.76 okay. We're ready to do that. We're adaptive. Yeah. But when you talk through it, it helps you and it helps them.
00:29:55.76 --> 00:30:02.16 Yeah. That's funny. Greg Train is a reason I ran into use like he's teaching whatever and then he
00:30:02.16 --> 00:30:06.40 just all of a sudden bus out. Hey, I'll teach him that move that you do. Now, it was pretty good at that
00:30:06.40 --> 00:30:12.000 move. I started teaching. It's like, it's like, it's a guard pass that I do sometime. And
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.84 Brian, teaching, I don't even know what I'm talking about. I'm like doing it all good, but
00:30:15.84 --> 00:30:21.36 and everyone's like, oh, all right, you know, I'm a poor teacher. Well, that's something you can
00:30:21.36 --> 00:30:27.04 work on, I guess, starting now, take over the podcast. I'm more comfortable avoiding it.
00:30:28.88 --> 00:30:36.96 Awesome. Now, now the next piece that I was thinking about on patrolling and that I saw my kids go
00:30:36.96 --> 00:30:42.96 through and that I went through as a young seal is you start questioning or you start going through
00:30:42.96 --> 00:30:49.20 this process. If what do I need to bring with me? What do I actually need to bring with me? Now,
00:30:49.20 --> 00:30:55.44 when you don't have to carry it, when you don't know what it means to carry it. Carry it. When I say
00:30:55.44 --> 00:31:01.36 carry, I mean, put it on your back and bear the weight of that item. When you don't have to do that,
00:31:01.36 --> 00:31:05.44 you want to carry everything. Yeah. I'll just carry everything, the warm sleeping bag and the
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:11.44 whisper light stove and the extra food and the comfort gear and all this stuff. That's what you do
00:31:11.44 --> 00:31:14.96 when you when you don't have to carry it, oh, you don't think about carrying it or you don't know what
00:31:14.96 --> 00:31:22.96 it feels like to carry it. But when you have to carry it, you get down to what you need real quick.
00:31:22.96 --> 00:31:31.92 To what you actually need real quick, totally limited on the food. You're not going to be. I never,
00:31:31.92 --> 00:31:38.56 I never heated a meal in the field. Unless it was like snow on the ground, a winter warfair scenario,
00:31:38.56 --> 00:31:45.20 never heated a meal in the ground. If it was never, never heated a meal because that means you had to
00:31:45.20 --> 00:31:51.76 bring a fuel and a whisper light and all this stuff. And I never, I was a radioman. So I had to already carry a
00:31:51.76 --> 00:31:56.88 radio and then I got used to that. So by the time I was an officer and I wasn't carrying a radio anymore,
00:31:56.88 --> 00:32:05.44 I said, I'm just going to be lighter than everybody else. Yeah. Comfort gear? No, we won't take that.
00:32:05.44 --> 00:32:11.84 And you need to get it. You need to bring enough comfort gear that you can actually sleep and survive.
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:17.04 I mean, you need to bring a ground pattern, whatever. But we used to say,
00:32:17.76 --> 00:32:21.68 little saying, let's travel light, freeze it night. That was my saying for sure, travel
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:29.04 life, freeze it night. And I'll tell you, I got my indoctrination to freezing at night and
00:32:29.04 --> 00:32:36.08 traveling light when I first checked into the team. I went to a comm school, communication school,
00:32:36.08 --> 00:32:40.48 a seal communications school. So you're going to be blown out of the radio in this yield teams.
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:46.88 And I had this, this old chief that was running the, uh, running the, running the training.
00:32:48.40 --> 00:32:52.88 And I was a fired up new guy. I didn't even have my tried it. So I was just brand new guy.
00:32:52.88 --> 00:32:56.72 Didn't even have my try knows at the team and they sent me to this school. And so this chief and I
00:32:56.72 --> 00:33:01.28 actually went with another new guy, who's, who's a great guy. And we went out there,
00:33:01.28 --> 00:33:05.28 told them, you guys, neither one of us had our try. It's we had graduated from Buds a couple months ago,
00:33:05.28 --> 00:33:10.96 or from airborne school, whatever. So we showed up at the winter time. And we show up in, and the
00:33:10.96 --> 00:33:18.16 end of this school, you go through a field training exercise. And it's, I want to say it's five days in
00:33:18.16 --> 00:33:22.000 the field. It's like Monday through Friday in the field or something along those lines.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.80 And you are basically doing the reconnaissance mission. And they give you really good targets to look at.
00:33:28.80 --> 00:33:31.60 And you're going to look at, and you're going to report back with all this information. And then you're
00:33:31.60 --> 00:33:37.12 going to move, they're going to move you every couple hours. They give you directions to a new point to move to.
00:33:37.12 --> 00:33:43.68 So we're doing, we're, we're getting ready for this FTX. And I'd never spent much time in the field.
00:33:43.68 --> 00:33:48.000 And the guy that's running the course, you know, he's having fun with the new guy. And he's like, hey,
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.40 well, Link. And I said, yes, chief, and he goes, you know what, you think you're hard to
00:33:52.40 --> 00:33:57.04 call him? I go, I'm trying to be hard, core. And he says, if you're really hard to call, you don't need
00:33:57.04 --> 00:34:02.80 a punch. You don't need a sleeping bag or a ground pad. You just go out there with a punch.
00:34:02.80 --> 00:34:10.88 I want a punch, a lighter. And I was like, okay, no problem. So sure enough, I go in the field of the
00:34:10.88 --> 00:34:17.52 punch, I want a punch, a lighter. And actually, actually, it was a bivisac, which is a Gore text. It's
00:34:17.52 --> 00:34:23.44 like a Gore text sleeping bag, just a thin Gore text shell. And a punch, a liner, which is something that's
00:34:23.44 --> 00:34:30.56 been around forever. And it's just a very thin, thin, like basically blanket. No, it's not even
00:34:30.56 --> 00:34:34.40 10. It's like a blanket. It's like a blanket. That's what it is. It's a liner. It's a very thin,
00:34:34.40 --> 00:34:40.64 it's yes, it's a very thin liner. It's what is the punch, a liner. And so I had those
00:34:40.64 --> 00:34:47.76 and the two things I had with me. And my buddy took the same. So we were like, oh, oh, that you
00:34:47.76 --> 00:34:53.76 need to be like, that's a hard core. Go, I'm hard core. How cold was it? Like, so we are going into
00:34:53.76 --> 00:34:58.16 the field. We're inserting in the field. And the sun is going like we inserted right at dusk,
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:04.40 as we're inserting in the field, it's raining. Right as we get on the ground, it turns to sleep.
00:35:04.40 --> 00:35:15.68 And then two hours into the night, it turns into snow. So we freeze. I mean, we freeze. We're just,
00:35:15.68 --> 00:35:21.92 we can't sleep. And the funny thing was was that we couldn't sleep. We literally couldn't sleep.
00:35:21.92 --> 00:35:26.80 It was too cold for us to sleep. And the guy had set it up. So you had to make a communications.
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:32.40 When you had to make communications, it was about every three or four hours. And so,
00:35:32.40 --> 00:35:36.96 and if you missed a communications window, if you missed it, that was, you know, you got,
00:35:36.96 --> 00:35:42.40 you grade went down or whatever you got points subtracted. So all the other guys who were
00:35:42.40 --> 00:35:46.88 experienced seals that knew how to live out in the field better than we did, they all were super comfortable.
00:35:48.32 --> 00:35:53.12 They all went out there and had sleeping bags, ground pads, and all that. And they slept through
00:35:53.12 --> 00:35:56.80 their com windows. At least some of them, they didn't sleep through all of them. Obviously, but occasionally
00:35:56.80 --> 00:36:02.40 it's sleep, they went after four days, three days, whatever. And so we were the only pair that made
00:36:02.40 --> 00:36:08.000 all of our com windows because we couldn't. Right? Good. You know, yeah, we'd just be standing up,
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.44 just standing up, standing by a tree, doing burpees. Just trying to, trying to survive. Yeah.
00:36:14.64 --> 00:36:20.56 So that was, that was one of the lessons on learning how to travel light freezing night.
00:36:20.56 --> 00:36:24.56 That was a little too much. I should, the thing I needed was a ground pad.
00:36:24.56 --> 00:36:29.84 Do you need a ground pad when you go in the field? So travel light freezing night is kind of like a warning
00:36:29.84 --> 00:36:36.000 or is that like, no, it's a deal. That's what you do. Oh, yeah. It was my methodology and it's a methodology of
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.04 a portion of guys in the military that are, that are on the, it would rather be on the hard side.
00:36:43.04 --> 00:36:47.44 Right. So I'm going to also all freeze at night so I can travel light freezing night.
00:36:47.44 --> 00:36:50.08 You're going to be more effective when you're, when you're lighter. Yeah.
00:36:50.08 --> 00:36:54.96 I mean, of course, if you're exhausted, that's why that's why there's got to be a balance there.
00:36:54.96 --> 00:36:59.36 We should have brought ground pads on that operation to that training operation for sure.
00:36:59.36 --> 00:37:05.36 Yeah. Because we're going to freeze. And like we got trench foot legit and the guy that was with me
00:37:05.36 --> 00:37:09.92 had legit trench foot when he got out. Like what is that like front bike? No, it's when your feet
00:37:09.92 --> 00:37:14.48 because this part of this, part of this training operation took place in, in like a swamp.
00:37:14.48 --> 00:37:21.36 Oh, dang. So it's freezing in the swamp and he got legit World War One style trench foot.
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:26.96 I had it too. My not as bad as him. But what is that? It's just your feet get numb and
00:37:26.96 --> 00:37:36.80 rodded and jacked up. Yeah. Good times. So, so again, how do we apply this to life? And I think
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:45.20 if you, if you look at what you want versus what you actually need. And imagine if you had to
00:37:45.20 --> 00:37:53.12 carry everything that you owned. Now, of course, that's not possible. But I think this is this whole
00:37:53.12 --> 00:37:59.68 like minimalist attitude that's that's kind of getting popular right now that it's getting popular
00:37:59.68 --> 00:38:03.84 in civilian world right now. But in the military, we've always valued that and that's one of the
00:38:03.84 --> 00:38:10.32 cool things about going away on deployment. For me, I always love this feeling when you went away
00:38:10.32 --> 00:38:16.08 on deployment. You could only take, and we as Seals took a lot of gear with us, but there's a limit.
00:38:16.08 --> 00:38:21.28 You took, you know, five or six kit bags, you know, five or six big, duffel bags basically
00:38:22.40 --> 00:38:27.60 filled with gear. And that's it. That's it. That's all your gear. That's all the gear you have. And so,
00:38:27.60 --> 00:38:33.52 honestly, to me, that that always felt good. That is what I got. This is everything I have. And,
00:38:33.52 --> 00:38:38.56 you know, as a young seal, that was basically you could fit all your gear in those six bags. And
00:38:38.56 --> 00:38:42.32 then everything you own in the civilian world, you could fit in two more bags. And we live that,
00:38:42.32 --> 00:38:46.56 like I live like that with my buddies back in the day. We live like that for a long time. Oh,
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:50.08 you, we can go to the point tomorrow. We can just put all of our stuff at home and get back. We can
00:38:50.08 --> 00:38:56.32 blow our stuff up a week. We ready to go. Yeah. Kind of like we're the military guys. You're kind of like
00:38:56.32 --> 00:39:03.92 the OG minimalist. Yeah. Back in the day. It's good. And we've got to teach Sarah this stuff. Yeah,
00:39:03.92 --> 00:39:08.96 well, people start to hold on to stuff. Especially the part where if, or when you carry it,
00:39:08.96 --> 00:39:12.96 you realize how much stuff, you know, that part where you're talking about, once you know the weight
00:39:12.96 --> 00:39:17.92 of your own stuff, you think twice before. Yeah, yeah. And it's really, really, it starts thinking about
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:21.60 the cost of that gear. And what does that mean over time? And how much of usage are you going to
00:39:21.60 --> 00:39:25.52 get out of it? Now, the thing that I hang on to, there's a couple of things that I'm a little bit of a
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:32.08 hoarder on. One of these T-shirts. Yeah, I'm not mad at them. Now, some people might be thinking,
00:39:32.08 --> 00:39:38.80 hey, Jocco, you wear the same freaking T-shirts. They're saying they which is true. Yeah. But I have,
00:39:38.80 --> 00:39:45.60 you know, old T-shirts that are just, I just, I just, I, because I wear my T-shirts a lot when I
00:39:45.60 --> 00:39:51.60 wear them. It's hard for me to part with them. Brad, better than that than shoot. You're like the, I have, I have,
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:55.76 I have a ton of old Jiu Jitsu T-shirts. Yeah. When I used to go to schools, I used to travel
00:39:55.76 --> 00:39:59.44 in a school. Yeah. Yeah. And they'd give me a T-shirt. Yeah. And I have all these old school
00:39:59.44 --> 00:40:02.72 T-shirts of schools that don't even exist or of schools that got really big or whatever,
00:40:03.44 --> 00:40:07.68 or just competitions that I did, you know, and you got those school T-shirts. Yeah. And I'm not,
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:12.64 I don't wear them anymore, but I can't. I was thinking, you know what I could do is inventory them,
00:40:12.64 --> 00:40:15.76 take pictures of them, and put them on the inner webs, and then throw them away.
00:40:16.32 --> 00:40:20.40 Wouldn't be, oh, like, like, like an archive. Yeah. Yeah. Because because there's some,
00:40:20.40 --> 00:40:24.64 it triggers memories that are, yeah. Yeah. It's like memory, be-lea. Yeah. It's basically smart cards.
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:30.88 Because you like to, it triggers the memory of those times of that event, or whatever.
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:33.52 Because otherwise you're not thinking about it. And there's a problem with that. I'll tell you,
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:39.36 I realize this from my experience growing up, you know, I grew up in New England, and I don't
00:40:39.36 --> 00:40:44.000 go home, didn't go home at all. They hardly ever go back to the town where I grew up.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.32 Mm-hmm. And the people that I know that are still there, they remember all this stuff.
00:40:48.88 --> 00:40:52.80 From when we were kids, they remember this event. That remember when this happened,
00:40:52.80 --> 00:40:57.52 and I honestly don't remember. I just don't remember it. Yeah.
00:40:57.52 --> 00:41:02.80 And I think the reason is because I went away from there, and I never went back,
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:07.12 and so I have nothing triggering those members. I don't see the school yard where the fight happened.
00:41:07.12 --> 00:41:11.68 And I don't see the road where the car flipped. I don't see that stuff.
00:41:11.68 --> 00:41:16.72 And so I don't remember it like they do. They're there all the time. Oh yeah, I remember when
00:41:16.72 --> 00:41:20.32 Little Johnny gave, you know, you know, it's like no, I actually don't remember that.
00:41:20.32 --> 00:41:23.60 So with some of this memory of Bilias, as you called it,
00:41:24.80 --> 00:41:28.88 if every time I look at it, I go, oh yeah, that was cool. Turned it. Well, that was cool.
00:41:28.88 --> 00:41:32.88 Training with those guys or whatever. So I have a bunch of just two teachers that I have an
00:41:32.88 --> 00:41:38.40 artifact getting apart. That's how. Partly, right. Yeah. I was taking them to the gym and framing them
00:41:38.40 --> 00:41:42.16 and hanging them up. You're a ghost. No, not you're a ghost. No, not you're a ghost. But they're
00:41:42.16 --> 00:41:46.08 old school teachers. They'd be cool to have those old students. And if you if you got my
00:41:46.08 --> 00:41:50.16 teacher, it's being T-shirts, Jeff and Glovers T-shirts and put them up there. That means sick.
00:41:50.16 --> 00:41:53.92 Yeah. Or you're on the other side of the poster. Remember best of the West? Remember that turn
00:41:53.92 --> 00:42:04.08 a bit. Yeah. That was a good one. It's just gone. Yeah. So that's it. You go through this checklist back
00:42:04.08 --> 00:42:08.000 to the subject here. You go through this checklist of what you actually need. And again, when you're
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.84 when you're in a business, you've got to look at what you what what do you need to complete this
00:42:11.84 --> 00:42:17.44 operation? What do you just want? Because it'd be nice to have and separate those things, separate
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:23.52 those things. You can actually put them in those categories. You know, need want nice to have,
00:42:23.52 --> 00:42:28.64 right? And then you go through. Okay. Let's let's concentrate on what we need first. And then we can see
00:42:28.64 --> 00:42:31.76 if there's anything that we want. And then by the way, if there's a nice to have, we can throw in
00:42:31.76 --> 00:42:38.40 their okay. Fine. But to go in there and just buy everything on that list or command everything on that
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:42.48 list, because you think you're going to need it? No wrong answer. Well, move. Yeah. And a lot of times
00:42:42.48 --> 00:42:48.08 people and of course, I'm not talking about maybe it or it does apply to business, but just in life
00:42:48.08 --> 00:42:54.48 what you need and what you want. You know, a lot of times what you want doesn't even facilitate
00:42:54.48 --> 00:42:59.04 what you need. You know, like you'd be like, oh, hey, I don't need faster internet, but I kind of
00:42:59.04 --> 00:43:03.12 want it. But the faster internet is going to facilitate my work. Well, let's say you do, you know,
00:43:03.12 --> 00:43:09.68 you need to do it. At least that's something sometimes people will get stuff that they want.
00:43:10.16 --> 00:43:15.68 That's just straight up no function. Yeah. Oh, yeah. For sure. Not my family.
00:43:15.68 --> 00:43:26.000 I know. I don't like things about function. I know. Like them. Don't like them. Um, okay. So,
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.04 so again, back to this, once you've decided on what you're going to bring or what you're going to
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:37.20 need, then time to start the operation. It's time to start this movement. And even when the
00:43:37.20 --> 00:43:42.24 start, you got to check confirm where you are, make sure you know, then you get started. And I had this
00:43:42.24 --> 00:43:46.48 first reminder when I did this little patrol with my kids because I just and I were going to go.
00:43:46.48 --> 00:43:50.08 It's a little trail. It's start walking. We started walking. I didn't keep a pace count.
00:43:51.44 --> 00:43:54.96 That's ridiculous. That's embarrassing to admit. Didn't keep a pace count. I know
00:43:54.96 --> 00:44:01.12 wasn't really paying attention. We were just kind of talking and having, yeah, we're just talking
00:44:01.12 --> 00:44:05.84 and moving and kind of getting used to it all and hey, how's your backpack feeling, all that stuff?
00:44:05.84 --> 00:44:11.12 And I'll also know, I go wait a second. Where are we? Where are we right now?
00:44:11.12 --> 00:44:15.36 Because I had told them that hey, we're going to be looking for the trail that goes up. And
00:44:16.24 --> 00:44:20.40 we talked through it. And we pulled out the map, and we started doing a little study. And my son was
00:44:20.40 --> 00:44:26.16 like immediately with, oh, we went too far. We missed it. I know what it's back there. And my daughter
00:44:26.16 --> 00:44:31.92 wouldn't commit either way. And I said, okay, let's do an assessment. And so we assessed and realized
00:44:31.92 --> 00:44:37.12 that we actually hadn't gone quite far enough. So we went a little bit further. But my point is that
00:44:37.12 --> 00:44:45.12 you got to check yourself. You got to check yourself and check your team consistently, not constantly.
00:44:45.12 --> 00:44:52.08 Right. That's micro management, but consistently. And you also have to watch out for target
00:44:52.08 --> 00:44:57.44 fixation, which is trying to go too fast. I go, you're just trying to get to that to the end
00:44:57.44 --> 00:45:03.76 point without going by your little waypoints along the way. That is a way to get yourself lost.
00:45:03.76 --> 00:45:09.68 Because you're driving and you're not looking for your reference points. And you'll lose the
00:45:09.68 --> 00:45:15.92 bubble. So you got to detach a little bit and stand back and pay attention and not be all crazy
00:45:15.92 --> 00:45:22.32 about that. You know, for you know, every 500 meters, maybe every, you do a quick check. Every
00:45:22.32 --> 00:45:31.92 thousand meters, you're going to do a little bit of more accurate study. And that's going to keep you
00:45:31.92 --> 00:45:37.60 and line. And if you are out of line, you're only going to be a little bit off track. You're not
00:45:37.60 --> 00:45:45.36 going to be 12 days of work or two hours of walking off track. Yeah, it makes perfect sense. Too
00:45:45.36 --> 00:45:50.08 especially going by all these reference points. The target fixation, you're just, you got one reference
00:45:50.08 --> 00:45:54.08 point. And it's probably not even that accurate because really just by the nature of the whole deal,
00:45:54.08 --> 00:45:58.08 the map, the one reference point that you do have is the furthest thing away. Literally.
00:45:58.08 --> 00:46:03.04 So you only have that one or for that. If you have all these other reference points, you get off track
00:46:03.04 --> 00:46:07.36 one step, two steps, three steps. You still got like a bunch of reference points. Just like,
00:46:07.36 --> 00:46:10.64 all right, let's backtrack all these reference points. You're good to do. There to support you.
00:46:10.64 --> 00:46:14.72 That's, that's how you do it. And that's again, that's when you're planning something with a team
00:46:14.72 --> 00:46:19.20 and a business. You got to have some reference points along the way. To help you get towards your goal.
00:46:19.20 --> 00:46:25.68 Yeah. Because your goal is far off in the distance. So you got to plan about how you're going to get there.
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:34.56 If you have a video or use photo shoppers, it has, this, when I first started, it has this history
00:46:35.68 --> 00:46:39.76 little box. So every movie, make it records it. That's pretty cool. Delete, delete, and then you
00:46:39.76 --> 00:46:46.16 have control at which is saved. But that's something else. But yeah, each one. So you can literally
00:46:46.16 --> 00:46:50.64 go, oh wait, it's reference point with every single move. That's awesome. So you can go up.
00:46:50.64 --> 00:46:56.16 Oh, let me go all the way back, you know, 25 moves to when I erase this little thing. Boop.
00:46:56.16 --> 00:47:00.64 Let me start from there. You know, you bring one thing back that's far up the chart. Yeah.
00:47:01.20 --> 00:47:05.84 Here's the only thing. It's like, but it's like a little, like a fork kind of. So like, let's say you go back
00:47:05.84 --> 00:47:11.84 in time essentially. You go back like five moves. And then you make a different move. It, that one
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:17.12 discourse. Yeah, it's gone. That's why in time travel. Yeah, exactly. It's time to time travel.
00:47:17.12 --> 00:47:23.92 All right. So when you get out on patrol now, um, disciplines paramount. Sure.
00:47:25.44 --> 00:47:29.44 For instance, you got to stay hydrated. You got to keep track of your gear. You got to keep track of your
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:34.40 pace count. You don't let your gear get out. You don't take out your gear. Like, oh, stop for seconds.
00:47:34.40 --> 00:47:39.68 I'm just going to pull everything out of my Bruxac and lay it all over the place. No, you got to keep it tight.
00:47:40.96 --> 00:47:47.04 You don't rush over obstacles. So for instance, oh, you know, there's a little log. And I got
00:47:47.04 --> 00:47:52.24 to see there's a log going across this trail. And I got to step over the log. Well, I step up on top of it.
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:56.48 And then I'm just going to jump off because I, it's a little easier. No, you don't just jump off because
00:47:56.48 --> 00:48:00.56 that's how you spray your ankle. That's how you blow out an E, which is, you know, what you're playing
00:48:00.56 --> 00:48:07.04 a basketball game or you're on the Jiu-Jitsu mat and you twist your ankle. Cool. Walk to the side,
00:48:07.04 --> 00:48:16.88 put some ice on it. Your, you know, 10 kilometers out in the middle of nowhere and one of your
00:48:16.88 --> 00:48:23.52 kids spraying an ankle. You're in trouble. Yeah. You're in trouble. And if you're out on patrol
00:48:23.52 --> 00:48:28.000 in a military situation and you get somebody that gets spraying ankle, you're even more
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.44 significant trouble. So you got to have the discipline to slow down, slow as moods, moods,
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:40.72 fast, watch your footing, watch for danger. Watch your field of fire. Pay attention to the first
00:48:40.72 --> 00:48:47.04 person that's in front of you and the person that's behind you. And that's how you're doing
00:48:47.04 --> 00:48:50.48 your communication. So you gotta keep your communication up the whole time. So again, you can go
00:48:50.48 --> 00:48:56.32 right to any business, any project that anyone's working on. It's all the same thing. You gotta be disciplined.
00:48:56.32 --> 00:49:01.28 You gotta keep track of things. You gotta keep your communication going between your team
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:06.80 members by passing whatever signals you gotta pass when you get to a layup point.
00:49:08.24 --> 00:49:12.64 When you're gonna actually stop and basically camp out, I hate saying that.
00:49:12.64 --> 00:49:15.84 Because in the in the in the in the sealed teams, it's derogatory to say,
00:49:15.84 --> 00:49:19.84 oh, right. It's kind of an upside. Yeah. Yeah. So you never want to have anybody say that.
00:49:19.84 --> 00:49:23.36 So I wouldn't let my when I won't control my kids. I was like, no, we're not camping. We're
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:28.48 in a layup point. But so you guys are camping out. No, we're not. So this,
00:49:28.48 --> 00:49:34.88 well, when you get to a layup point where you're gonna stop, you don't just flop down and turn into
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:42.88 a pile of crap. And this is true. Again, with a business situation, you reach one goal. You don't just
00:49:42.88 --> 00:49:50.24 like flop down and say, oh, we did it high five office party. No, you can you can order pizza,
00:49:50.24 --> 00:49:55.28 maybe, but you're not ordering booze. You know what I'm saying? You still got stuff to do. So you don't
00:49:55.28 --> 00:50:01.12 camp out. You have to remain tact or you have to remain disciplined. You have to quietly assume
00:50:01.12 --> 00:50:07.04 your security position. You got to then be quiet and make sure you are as alone as you think you are.
00:50:07.04 --> 00:50:10.32 Then you got to pick out some landmarks. Once you get to your little layup point,
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:14.72 you got to you got to make that your home. You know, you got to look at for some landmarks or some
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:21.20 somewhere where you know where you are. And then you confirm your position. You know, you take a
00:50:21.20 --> 00:50:26.64 triangulation with your compass, maybe even break out your GPS, get a little double confirmation.
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:32.24 And then once you've got everything set, then you can take a little breather. But what you don't do is
00:50:32.24 --> 00:50:38.24 get to the finish line and just flop down and we made it. You never want to do that. And the other
00:50:38.24 --> 00:50:42.64 piece, this is something I found about a lot while I was on this patrol with my with my two kids.
00:50:42.64 --> 00:50:50.88 I went with two out of the four kids. When that we kind of have a standard in most militarys do this,
00:50:50.88 --> 00:50:54.96 you're going to when you're when you're doing a patrol, you're going to move for 50 minutes.
00:50:54.96 --> 00:50:58.000 You're going to walk for 50 minutes and you're going to rest for 10. Then you walk for 15,
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.44 rest for 10. Walk for 15. That's kind of the standard. And I can tell you that if you aren't careful,
00:51:06.40 --> 00:51:13.28 it can be hard to start up again. And you get tired legs and you get sore shoulders and you get
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:20.40 hunger and you get thirsty and it's easy to let 10 minutes turn into 15 minutes and turn into 20
00:51:20.40 --> 00:51:27.44 minutes and turn into a half an hour. That can happen very, very easily. And this is the thing you
00:51:27.44 --> 00:51:38.40 gotta remember. While you are resting, you are getting no closer to your target. There is no progress
00:51:38.40 --> 00:51:47.84 that is being made. And by the way, the only person that is going to move you toward that target is you.
00:51:51.28 --> 00:51:55.04 You're the only person that's going to move you towards that target. You're not going to get
00:51:55.04 --> 00:51:59.76 carried. The target's not going to move to you. You are the only person that's going to move to the
00:51:59.76 --> 00:52:04.88 target. And if you don't move, you'll never get there. And the faster you get there, the better off,
00:52:04.88 --> 00:52:09.84 you're going to be. Now again, this doesn't mean that you're simply grinding yourself and your
00:52:09.84 --> 00:52:14.72 team into the dirt. There are rest periods involved there. You have 10 minutes of rest. You have 50 minutes
00:52:14.72 --> 00:52:23.36 of work. So I'm not talking about smashing your team. But you absolutely do have to drive your team
00:52:23.92 --> 00:52:31.68 because there will be no progress in the comfort zone. There will not. In the inside the comfort zone,
00:52:31.68 --> 00:52:40.40 there's no progress happening. There's nothing happening. And when you're patrolling with a rucksack
00:52:40.40 --> 00:52:45.84 on, it is not comfortable. It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable. It's not easy. And that is one
00:52:45.84 --> 00:52:52.80 of the things. That's why this discipline of keeping moving and continuing to push the pace is so
00:52:52.80 --> 00:53:01.20 powerful. And that's the same thing with any goal. Obviously, the correlation here is that any goal that
00:53:01.20 --> 00:53:09.44 you're going for, you have to keep moving toward it. You have to stay on the path. Do you have to
00:53:09.44 --> 00:53:18.72 rest? Yes. But you have to go. You have to go down that path. And that is another one of these
00:53:18.72 --> 00:53:25.36 principles and all these principles. They really applied everything that I did in my
00:53:25.36 --> 00:53:31.44 seal career. Regardless of what I was doing. The same things, planning well, setting goals,
00:53:31.44 --> 00:53:37.04 knowing what they looked like, staying disciplined on everything on every type of mission, on every
00:53:37.04 --> 00:53:46.08 task, every job. That is what I always did. I didn't take it easy. Did I rest? Sure. Of course,
00:53:46.08 --> 00:54:02.88 I rested. But did I cut corners? Did I take the easy way? Did I slack off? No. No, I did not. I held the line.
00:54:02.88 --> 00:54:14.08 Now, from a leadership perspective, all this talk of marching and patrolling made me think of a
00:54:15.28 --> 00:54:25.84 short story called The Beloved Captain, which I was recently introduced to by the wife of one of
00:54:25.84 --> 00:54:32.56 the finest leaders I've ever worked for. A guy named General Sean McFarlane, who was the
00:54:32.56 --> 00:54:38.80 Colonel at the time who was commanding the one one AD. The first brigade in the first armored division
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:46.56 otherwise known as the ready first during the Battle of Ramadi. And I recently saw General McFarlane's
00:54:46.56 --> 00:54:58.08 wife at a memorial event that we did for the 10 year anniversary of Mark Lee's death. She told me about
00:54:58.08 --> 00:55:06.48 this story. Again, it's called The Beloved Captain and it lays out some fundamental leadership
00:55:06.48 --> 00:55:14.40 principles. And when the General's wife told me that he kind of referred to this story himself
00:55:14.40 --> 00:55:23.04 for guidance, I figured maybe the kind of guidance we could all use. And the story is written by a
00:55:23.04 --> 00:55:34.000 guy named Donald Hanky, who served with the British Army in World War I, a volunteer who enlisted
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:44.40 at age 29. Despite having served as an officer when he was younger, he enlisted to go fight
00:55:44.40 --> 00:55:53.04 and he eventually regained his commission. And in both as a enlisted guy as an and as an officer,
00:55:53.04 --> 00:56:05.52 he fought on the front lines. And he wrote this story, which is called as I said, the Beloved Captain.
00:56:10.32 --> 00:56:16.40 He came in the early days when we were still at recruit drills under hot September sun,
00:56:16.40 --> 00:56:26.48 tall, erect, smiling. So we first saw him and so he remained to the end. At the start,
00:56:27.52 --> 00:56:32.64 he knew as little of soldiering as we did. He used to watch us being drilled by the sergeant,
00:56:32.64 --> 00:56:38.88 but his manner of watching was peculiar to his own. He never looked bored. He was learning just as
00:56:38.88 --> 00:56:46.32 much as we were. In fact, more, he was learning his job. And from the first he saw that his job was
00:56:46.32 --> 00:56:56.56 more than to give us the correct orders. His job was to lead us. So he watched and noted many things
00:56:56.56 --> 00:57:05.44 and never found the time hang on heavy, heavy on his hands. He watched our evolutions so as to
00:57:05.44 --> 00:57:10.56 learn to learn the correct orders. He watched for the right manner of command, the manner which
00:57:10.56 --> 00:57:15.44 secured the most prompt response to an order. And he watched every one of us for our individual
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:23.20 characteristics. We were his men. Already, he took an almost paternal interest in us. He noted the
00:57:23.20 --> 00:57:30.08 men who tried hard, but were naturally slow and awkward. He distinguished them from those who were
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:36.40 inattentive and bored. He marked down the keen and most efficient among us. Most of all,
00:57:36.40 --> 00:57:41.76 he studied those who were subject to moods, who were sulky one day and willing the next.
00:57:41.76 --> 00:57:50.000 These were the ones who were to turn the scale. If he could get these on his side, the battle would
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.20 be one. So here's this leader. Very important for him to learn about his men and know his men
00:57:59.84 --> 00:58:09.52 and study his men. We have heard this before. Back to the book. For the first few days, he just watched.
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:15.04 Then he started work. He picked out some of the most awkward ones and a company by a corporal
00:58:15.04 --> 00:58:21.68 marched them away by themselves. In generously, he explained that he did not know much himself yet.
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:27.84 But he thought that they might get on better if they drilled by themselves a bit and that if it
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:34.08 helped them and they helped him, they would soon learn. So there's some serious humility going on there.
00:58:34.08 --> 00:58:38.48 He's like, hey, I don't know that much. You guys don't know that much. Let's help each other.
00:58:38.48 --> 00:58:44.88 Let's build a little team here. His confidence was infectious. He looked at them and they looked at
00:58:44.88 --> 00:58:53.28 him and the men pulled themselves together and determined to do their best. So he formed relationships here.
00:58:55.92 --> 00:59:04.16 Their best surprised themselves. His patience was inexhaustible. His simplicity could not fail to be
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:11.92 understood. He's keeping them simple. So simple that they could not fail to be understood. His
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:18.96 keenness and optimism carried all with them. Very soon, the awkward squad found themselves
00:59:18.96 --> 00:59:24.000 awkward no longer. And soon after that, they ceased to be a squad and went back to the platoon.
00:59:24.56 --> 00:59:30.56 Then he started to drill the platoon with a sergeant standing by to point out his mistakes. Of course,
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:34.80 he made mistakes and when that happened, he never minded admitting it.
00:59:37.20 --> 00:59:42.56 Some extreme ownership going on. He would explain what mistakes he had made and try again.
00:59:43.28 --> 00:59:50.48 The result was that we began to take almost as much interest and pride in his progress as he did in
00:59:50.48 --> 00:59:59.12 ours. We were his men and he was our leader. We felt that he was a credit to us and we resolved to be a
00:59:59.12 --> 01:00:06.24 credit to him. There was a bond of mutual confidence and affection between us which grew stronger and
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:13.92 stronger as the months passed. He had a smile for almost everyone but we thought he had a different
01:00:13.92 --> 01:00:21.44 smile for us. We looked for it and were never disappointed. On parade, as long as we were trying,
01:00:21.44 --> 01:00:27.76 his smile encouraged us. Off parade if we passed him and saluted, his eyes looked straight into our own
01:00:27.76 --> 01:00:34.40 and his smile greeted us. It was a wonderful thing that smile of his. It was something worth
01:00:34.40 --> 01:00:42.64 living for when worth working for. It bucked one up when one was bored or tired. It seemed to make one
01:00:42.64 --> 01:00:49.04 look at things from a different point of view, a finer point of view, his point of view. There was
01:00:49.04 --> 01:00:58.64 nothing feeble or weak about it. It was not monotonous like the smile of sunny gym. It meant something.
01:00:59.52 --> 01:01:06.48 It meant that we were his men and that he was proud of us and sure that we were going to do
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:12.72 jolly well better than any of the other potuins and it made us determine that we would.
01:01:12.72 --> 01:01:24.24 When we failed him, when he was disappointed in us, he did not smile. He did not rage or curse.
01:01:25.52 --> 01:01:32.24 He just looked disappointed and that made us feel far more savage with ourselves than any amount of
01:01:32.24 --> 01:01:40.96 swearing would have done. Point we've talked about on here many times. That guy that's yelling and
01:01:40.96 --> 01:01:49.68 screaming, not getting respect. That has a lot to do. Probably everything to do. Also with remember
01:01:49.68 --> 01:01:56.96 who we were talking about, use the carrot nut to stick. That's basically on top of the bond or
01:01:56.96 --> 01:02:02.72 it could be a kind of the same thing. When they look for that approval, which we all do with our friends,
01:02:02.72 --> 01:02:09.36 especially, they're not looking to avoid him getting mad. They're looking to make them happy.
01:02:09.36 --> 01:02:15.20 Because of how that feels or how good that is. He doesn't have to get mad. He just has to
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:19.92 basically go to zero. He doesn't have to go negative 10 on him. He goes to zero or one. They're like
01:02:19.92 --> 01:02:25.92 dang. I bet I'm going to get back to that 10. Yeah. And it's just great language. He just looked
01:02:25.92 --> 01:02:32.48 disappointed and that made us feel far more savage with ourselves than any amount of swearing would have
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:42.32 done. And I had a boss like that one time. Our whole golden life was just to make him look good and
01:02:42.32 --> 01:02:51.92 have him say give us a smile and we're all fired up. Back to the book. He made us feel that we were
01:02:51.92 --> 01:02:55.60 not playing the game with him. This is if they messed up. He made us feel that we were not playing the
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:03.12 game by him. It was not what he said. He was never very good at talking. It was just how he looked.
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:09.44 And his look of displeasure and disappointment was a thing that we would do anything to avoid.
01:03:10.32 --> 01:03:18.80 The fact was that he had won his way into our affections. We loved him. And there isn't anything
01:03:18.80 --> 01:03:29.68 stronger than love when all said and done. He was humble too. If that is the right word and I think
01:03:29.68 --> 01:03:37.68 it is, no trouble of ours was too small for him to attend to. When we started root marches,
01:03:37.68 --> 01:03:44.08 for instance, and our feet were blistered and sore as they often were at first. You would have
01:03:44.08 --> 01:03:50.16 thought that they were his own feet from the trouble he took. Of course, after the march there
01:03:50.16 --> 01:03:56.96 was always an inspection of feet. That is routine. But with him, it was no mere routine. He came
01:03:56.96 --> 01:04:03.28 into our rooms and if anyone had a sore fit, foot, he would kneel down on the floor and look at it
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:10.000 as carefully as if he had been a doctor. Then he would prescribe and the remedies were ready at hand
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.16 being borne by the sergeant. If a blister had to be lanced, he would very likely lanced it himself
01:04:16.16 --> 01:04:21.52 then in there so as to make sure there was done with a clean needle and that no dirt was allowed to get in.
01:04:24.88 --> 01:04:32.40 There was no application about this, no striving after effect. There was simply that he felt that
01:04:32.40 --> 01:04:40.000 our feet were pretty important and that he knew that we were pretty careless. So he thought it best
01:04:41.44 --> 01:04:48.32 at the start to see to the matter himself. Nevertheless, there was an arise something almost
01:04:48.32 --> 01:04:55.92 religious about this care for our feet. It seemed to have a touch of the Christ about it and we loved
01:04:55.92 --> 01:05:04.16 and honored him the more. Literally getting down on his hands and knees and caring for the feet
01:05:04.16 --> 01:05:12.40 of his men. And you know, you can imagine the leaders that would see this as being beneath them
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:22.08 and maybe even thinking in some way that this would make them look bad. But you can see obviously
01:05:22.08 --> 01:05:32.16 he's comparing him to Jesus. So I think it was a, I think it had a good effect on the men.
01:05:35.12 --> 01:05:43.92 We knew that we should lose him. For one thing, we knew that he would be promoted. It was our
01:05:43.92 --> 01:05:51.28 great hope that someday he would command the company. Also, we knew that he would be killed.
01:05:52.96 --> 01:06:01.04 He was so amazingly unself-conscious. For that reason, we knew that he would be absolutely fearless.
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:08.96 He would be so keen on the job and hand and so anxious for his men that he would forget about his own
01:06:08.96 --> 01:06:16.88 danger. So it proved. He was a captain when we went out to the front. Whenever there was a tires
01:06:16.88 --> 01:06:24.16 and job to be done, he was there in charge. If ever there were a moment of danger, he was on the spot.
01:06:25.60 --> 01:06:31.04 If there were any particular part of the line where the shells were falling faster or the bombs
01:06:31.04 --> 01:06:37.52 dropping more thickly than in other parts, he was in it. It was not that he was conceited and
01:06:37.52 --> 01:06:44.32 imagined himself indispensable. It was just that he was so keen that the men should do their
01:06:44.32 --> 01:06:51.92 best and act worthy of the regiment. He knew that fellows hated turning out at night for fatigue
01:06:52.80 --> 01:06:58.48 when they were in a rest camp. He knew how tires in the long march there and back and digging in
01:06:58.48 --> 01:07:03.52 the dark for an unknown purpose were. He knew that the fellows would be inclined to growls and
01:07:03.52 --> 01:07:09.04 sure. So he thought that it was up to him to go and show them that he thought it was a job worth
01:07:09.04 --> 01:07:16.08 doing. And the fact that he was there put a new complexion on the matter altogether. No one would
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:23.44 sure if he was there. No one would grumble so much either. What was good enough for him was good enough for us.
01:07:23.44 --> 01:07:35.52 So you got to get out there and you have told stories about picking up brass and doing the
01:07:35.52 --> 01:07:44.56 taking the bad watches, all those things. And this is a exact commentary about that. Just because
01:07:44.56 --> 01:07:48.08 you're in a leadership position doesn't mean you don't get to do the hard stuff or you don't have to
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:55.36 do the hard stuff. It actually means you do the hard stuff. But I was talking to Jade. He did as
01:07:55.36 --> 01:08:02.72 ago. And, you know, he's the boss of his company and stuff. Man, that pretty much every word that's
01:08:02.72 --> 01:08:09.04 coming from that is like, man, it's reminding me of this where, like, this certain people in a group
01:08:09.04 --> 01:08:13.44 that can do that, that can go and like, you know, he'll wash your shoes and you don't, you don't
01:08:13.44 --> 01:08:18.56 automatically have that respect. And in some cases, you'll have less respect if like,
01:08:20.24 --> 01:08:23.92 sure, like they're kissing your butt and they don't have anything to look up to, you know, or,
01:08:23.92 --> 01:08:30.80 you know, these these kind of guys or whatever. But the point is as the leader or the boss or the
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:37.20 dad or whatever. Like everyone in the group is watching you. People are watching. So if you're like,
01:08:37.20 --> 01:08:44.40 you can be like, hey, you can make 10, 20, 50 great moves. And then, but let's say you just kind of
01:08:44.40 --> 01:08:48.64 come in late every day or something like that or like you're disappointed. Yeah, they're watching.
01:08:48.64 --> 01:08:53.12 So they're like, okay, I see that. And they're not being critical necessarily. They're just watching.
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:57.92 More odd thing. I'm sure you, I mean, they can go conscious or even subconscious. They could
01:08:57.92 --> 01:09:01.92 be, yeah, they could be getting critical. But man, they're watching. So when you're like,
01:09:01.92 --> 01:09:07.84 when, if they see slack off, they're like, uh, it's okay to slack off. Yeah, all right. Okay.
01:09:07.84 --> 01:09:11.84 Okay. Well, okay. That's what we're doing. You're needing, you know. Yeah. If you're from a leadership position,
01:09:11.84 --> 01:09:16.48 position, you're slacking. Your followers are going to slack. There's no doubt about it. Let there be no doubt.
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:21.52 How are you lose your temper or even even if like you think no one's paying attention. You're like,
01:09:22.24 --> 01:09:25.76 you know, your kid is cruising with you, whatever you're on the phone with. I don't know. The
01:09:25.76 --> 01:09:31.76 cable guy and, you know, how they schedule the, you know, in your matter, whatever. I'll be there between nine a
01:09:31.76 --> 01:09:37.68 a, m, and nine p, m. I may have the next there or something. And he loses your temper on the cable guy.
01:09:37.68 --> 01:09:41.68 He's watching. You're like, oh, okay. That's kind of how it is. Like, that's how we do it.
01:09:41.68 --> 01:09:47.20 Kind of thing, you know, prep people watching. So yeah, this guy, where he's doing the hard stuff,
01:09:47.20 --> 01:09:52.56 you know, the top level stuff, bottom light he's doing it all. People are watching it and they see it.
01:09:52.56 --> 01:09:56.16 So they're like, man, that's the way to roll. I mean, literally something that they didn't think
01:09:56.16 --> 01:10:02.16 would digging in and move moving at night and digging in, you know, for an unknown purpose, they,
01:10:02.16 --> 01:10:05.60 they, he knew that they weren't fired up. As soon as he showed up and started doing it, they all
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:09.52 realized, okay, if it's good enough for him. That's how we're rolling. It's good enough for us.
01:10:10.32 --> 01:10:16.56 They're back to the book. What was good enough for him was good enough for us. If it were not too much
01:10:16.56 --> 01:10:24.80 trouble for him to turn out, it was not too much trouble for us. He knew too how trying the nerves,
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:31.12 how trying to the nerves it is to sit in a trench and be sheldered. He knew what a temptation there is
01:10:31.12 --> 01:10:37.44 to move a bit farther down the trench and herd together in a bunch at what seems the safest end.
01:10:38.48 --> 01:10:45.12 He knew too the folly of doing it and that there, that it was not the thing to do, not done in
01:10:45.12 --> 01:10:52.16 the best regiments. So he went along to see that it did not happen to see that the men stuck to their
01:10:52.16 --> 01:10:57.68 posts and conquered their nerves. And as soon as we saw him, we forgot our own anxiety.
01:10:58.56 --> 01:11:05.12 It was a bit further down, sir. We are all right here, but don't you go exposing yourself.
01:11:05.84 --> 01:11:11.92 We didn't matter. We knew it then. We were just rank and file bound to take risks. The company
01:11:11.92 --> 01:11:17.76 would get along all right without us, but the captain, how was the company to get on without him?
01:11:18.96 --> 01:11:25.20 To see him was to catch his point of view to forget our personal anxieties and think only of
01:11:25.20 --> 01:11:32.40 the company and the regiment and honor. That's an interesting concept.
01:11:32.40 --> 01:11:41.60 Is that your, this leader's presence actually opened his troopers minds to what he saw?
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:52.72 That's awesome. There was not one of us, but would gladly have died for him.
01:11:53.68 --> 01:12:00.16 We longed for the chance to show him that. We weren't heroes. We never dreamed about getting the
01:12:00.16 --> 01:12:05.76 Victoria cross, but to save the captain, we would have earned it 10 times over.
01:12:06.56 --> 01:12:09.76 And never have cared a button whether we got it or not.
01:12:12.96 --> 01:12:21.12 We never got the chance. Worst luck. It was all the other way. We were holding some trenches,
01:12:21.12 --> 01:12:28.40 which were about as unhealthiest trenches could be. The boaches, which is a sling term for
01:12:28.40 --> 01:12:36.32 the Germans. The boaches were only a few yards away. And we're well supplied with trench mortars.
01:12:36.32 --> 01:12:41.28 We hadn't got any at the time. Bombs and air torpedoes were dropping round us all day.
01:12:41.84 --> 01:12:46.16 Of course, the captain was there. It seemed as if he could not keep away.
01:12:47.60 --> 01:12:51.60 A torpedo fell into the trench and buried some of our trap, chaps.
01:12:51.60 --> 01:12:59.04 The fellows next to them ran to dig them out. Of course, he was the first one.
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:06.80 Then came another torpedo in the same place. That was the end.
01:13:09.76 --> 01:13:18.96 But he lives. Somehow he lives. And we who knew him do not forget.
01:13:18.96 --> 01:13:25.84 We feel his eyes on us. We still work for that wonderful smile of his.
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:33.44 There are not many of the old lot left now, but I think those who went west have seen him.
01:13:34.88 --> 01:13:38.80 When they got to the other side, I think they were met.
01:13:40.64 --> 01:13:48.16 Someone said, well done, good and faithful servant. And as they knelt before, that gracious
01:13:48.16 --> 01:13:53.12 pierced figure, I reckon they saw nearby the captain's smile.
01:13:56.16 --> 01:14:01.68 Anyway, in that faith, let me die if death should come my way.
01:14:03.60 --> 01:14:08.48 And so, I think shall I die content.
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:29.12 And die he did. Donald Hanky, who wrote that story was badly wounded in the battle
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:39.04 leepers on July 30, 15 and after recovering from those wounds, he went back to the front, including action
01:14:39.04 --> 01:14:47.92 at the battle of the song. And later, preparing to go over the top at one, 30 in the afternoon,
01:14:47.92 --> 01:15:00.08 on October 12, 1916, Lieutenant Hanky, was reported to have told his men if wounded,
01:15:00.08 --> 01:15:10.24 blighty, if killed, resurrection. And blighty was a term that basically met million dollar
01:15:10.24 --> 01:15:15.44 wound, which we've talked about before on this podcast, the million dollar wound is
01:15:15.44 --> 01:15:20.08 how you get shot, it gets you off the front, but it doesn't kill you and it doesn't
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:25.60 mean you for life. It's a million dollar wound and the brits called that a blighty. And so,
01:15:25.60 --> 01:15:31.04 at one, 30 in the afternoon, October 12, as his guys are getting ready to go over the top, he tells
01:15:31.04 --> 01:15:38.64 his men, if wounded blighty, if killed, resurrection. So you boys have nothing to fear.
01:15:38.64 --> 01:15:50.96 Shortly thereafter, he was killed. He is said to have been buried near the spot where he fell
01:15:50.96 --> 01:16:06.48 although the grave was never found. But we do have his words. So let us heed those words
01:16:06.48 --> 01:16:18.000 as we try to lead others as well as he did as well as we can as well as the beloved captain.
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:37.28 With that, it's been some time since we've done some questions for the internet, so we can
01:16:37.28 --> 01:16:50.88 move to those questions. So it's good. After, after hearing a story like that,
01:16:52.16 --> 01:17:00.08 it's always tough for me to remember that when you hear one story like that,
01:17:00.08 --> 01:17:07.92 you've got to remember that there are thousands and thousands and thousands of stories like that
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:26.88 of war and of leadership and of sacrifice. And if we don't do our damnedest to learn from those lessons
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:35.92 and apply them, I question whether we even deserve to have this life.
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:44.96 Yeah, about this story, be lovey captain. Yes.
01:17:47.36 --> 01:17:52.40 Like that's such a clear demonstration on how to be, where these guys would follow this guy
01:17:52.40 --> 01:17:56.24 basically into fire. They could probably watch him walk into a pit of fire and they don't follow.
01:17:57.28 --> 01:18:03.52 They did. Yeah. Think about it. They did. That's a world war one was. Yeah. Stand up. Go
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:10.08 follow me. We're going to do this. Yeah. So if this guy's near presence can make
01:18:11.12 --> 01:18:16.88 these other guys follow him like that in these type of situations, like if more people would be
01:18:16.88 --> 01:18:23.84 like this guy, you know. In normal life, I mean, it'd be a breeze to have people, you know,
01:18:24.56 --> 01:18:31.04 listen to you and you guys get some stuff done and how much of the stuff that the beloved captain
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:38.80 does is counter-intuitive of what people think of a military guy. I mean, almost everything in there,
01:18:39.60 --> 01:18:46.32 he's admitting his mistakes. He's figuring out who's awkward admitting to them that he's kind of
01:18:46.32 --> 01:18:52.72 messed up to. He's getting down on his knees and basically being almost submissive to his
01:18:52.72 --> 01:18:59.28 man in order to make sure that they're healthy. He's taking all the hard jobs. He's smiling
01:18:59.28 --> 01:19:05.52 and developing these strong relationships with his men. Like every one of those things is almost
01:19:05.52 --> 01:19:12.72 counter to what people think a big tough military leader is. The drill sergeant, the drill sergeant
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:20.48 leader, like no. And so I see people in the civilian sector that end up in the same way. They think
01:19:20.48 --> 01:19:25.28 they think that that's how you lead because they've seen it in a movie. You know, that is not that
01:19:25.28 --> 01:19:35.36 that hyperaggressive mentality is ineffective with human beings. And actually, there's a question here
01:19:35.36 --> 01:19:39.84 where we'll probably talk about that some more. But that's why I always make it perfectly clear
01:19:39.84 --> 01:19:44.72 that I'm all about being aggressive. I'm all about being aggressive, but being aggressive towards
01:19:44.72 --> 01:19:49.60 your mission, not towards people. I mean, unless a person warrants aggressiveness, which does happen
01:19:49.60 --> 01:19:58.48 from time to time. That's called a fist fight. You know, far you noted where his mere presence
01:19:59.60 --> 01:20:06.32 kind of imp not imposed, but impacts their perspective, where it's like it's basically him walking
01:20:06.32 --> 01:20:11.84 in to whatever the situation. And them just kind of automatically, what's he seeing? Right. You know,
01:20:11.84 --> 01:20:16.40 they're so just kind of mean to him. Hey, let me move this weapon because he's a bad spot. Let me
01:20:16.40 --> 01:20:21.68 let me put it like this stuff up over here. That is completely right. Completely right. I was on a ship one
01:20:21.68 --> 01:20:27.76 time. And I thought I was about the commanding officer on a ship. There's something called the one
01:20:27.76 --> 01:20:32.16 MC, which is a basically loud speaker that goes throughout every portion of the ship. Everyone can
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:37.68 hear it. And this commanding officer gets on the one MC and he's going to make a speech, right?
01:20:37.68 --> 01:20:44.24 Because that's what commanding officer does sometimes. And he says, I thought he was going to make the
01:20:44.24 --> 01:20:48.000 most epic speech because he's not the most epic. But I thought he's going to say something pretty powerful.
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.92 Sure. He says, um, he says, hey, when you when when when you see a piece of trash on the ship,
01:20:55.92 --> 01:21:02.56 and when I see a piece of trash, I thought he was going to say, when I see a piece of trash, man, I go and pick it up.
01:21:03.60 --> 01:21:08.88 And he said he said something along the lines of when I see a piece of trash, I'm frustrated that
01:21:08.88 --> 01:21:14.08 nobody picked it up. And think about the the impact of those two statements, if he said what I thought he was
01:21:14.08 --> 01:21:19.44 going to say, which is, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the floor, I go over and I pick it up and
01:21:19.44 --> 01:21:24.80 put it away or throw it away. And then I make sure there's no other trash near it because I want this ship to
01:21:24.80 --> 01:21:31.52 shine. That's one thing. He said, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the ship, I get so frustrated
01:21:31.52 --> 01:21:36.88 that you aren't cleaning it up. And I was so let down that that that commanding officer said,
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:42.72 that's true. But to your point, if you know, it's like the reason I thought of that is because you
01:21:42.72 --> 01:21:50.24 can see when even when I'm been in the commander of a unit of some kind, and I would see when I
01:21:50.24 --> 01:21:55.44 walk in unexpected, there's like a change. You know, and it's not always, you know, sometimes I've seen
01:21:55.44 --> 01:22:00.08 it where guys, the commander walks in and it's people who do that because of fear, right? Yeah, that's
01:22:00.08 --> 01:22:04.96 not different. That's not what we're looking for. Yeah. You want to say, oh, the boss is here. I don't
01:22:04.96 --> 01:22:09.36 want him to see that this is going on. I don't know. This is we shouldn't be doing that. We should.
01:22:09.36 --> 01:22:13.76 And that's you're right. That is a real powerful, real powerful,
01:22:13.76 --> 01:22:21.52 thought that he puts in here about how when the boss comes around, when the commander comes around
01:22:21.52 --> 01:22:27.92 and you, and it actually provides the troopers, the ability to see what he's seeing and how powerful
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:33.12 that is. Well, in time, Jita, I forget what he had to do this thing where it's like it was like a
01:22:33.12 --> 01:22:38.16 tense thing. And he was just telling, he's talking to Sarah about it. And he's like, yeah, I'm going to
01:22:38.16 --> 01:22:42.000 leave like right after that because I don't want to have to face like some awkwardness or something
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.20 like that. And then I'm kind of once there are life-hours like, I'm going to tell Jockel that you're
01:22:47.20 --> 01:22:53.12 going to do that. And you're like, oh, like, you knew how's joking, but he was like, you know, kind of like,
01:22:53.12 --> 01:22:58.08 what would you think about that? You're not even in Swasberland. Obviously, but it's kind of like that thing.
01:22:58.08 --> 01:23:03.92 You know, like, it would like, you're watching remember, Commander? Yeah, it's not like, yeah,
01:23:03.92 --> 01:23:11.04 go ahead. The part, there's this part, right? Where the story behind Commander is one of his
01:23:11.04 --> 01:23:17.68 guys that he trained and stuff went rogue, went bad, came back and they thought he was dead and
01:23:17.68 --> 01:23:22.88 he comes back and he helps, you know, you know, you know, great, sorry. Yeah, but it's built. Anyway,
01:23:23.84 --> 01:23:29.20 so this bad guy now, he, you could still, you could tell he still has all this admiration for
01:23:29.20 --> 01:23:34.72 his name is John Matrix for Arnold. They have Arnold because he's like, he's walking around the
01:23:34.72 --> 01:23:39.44 compound that he's kind of like, you know, and all these guys are like talking tough and stuff.
01:23:39.44 --> 01:23:46.56 So he goes to the other boss that he's now working with. He's all, it's funny to hear your men talk
01:23:46.56 --> 01:23:51.28 tough, it makes me laugh. If Matrix was here, he'd laugh too. You know, kind of like he's,
01:23:51.28 --> 01:23:55.76 it's almost like him and Matrix run the same team still, you know, he knows how he would see that,
01:23:55.76 --> 01:24:06.32 you know, kind of that same thing. Presence. Awesome. So, wrapping that rough transition,
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:13.04 hmm. People want to support the podcasts. Are they going to do it? Echo Charles.
01:24:14.24 --> 01:24:23.76 Well, one way, the way I like to recommend one of the many is by supporting yourself at the same
01:24:23.76 --> 01:24:30.24 time on its supplements and where your bars on a dot com slash joc will get 10% off.
01:24:30.24 --> 01:24:39.92 Before this podcast, I'll make it short. Before this podcast, when I get a
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:49.52 a shrimp tech, I didn't get 10% off. Now you can get 10% off or if you shop at Amazon,
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:54.64 click through our websites is another way you can support podcasts. Click through our websites,
01:24:54.64 --> 01:25:01.92 Amazon link. Our website that's jocobotcast.com and jocostore.com. There's a little thing you can click on.
01:25:03.12 --> 01:25:07.68 Yep, and you can support that way. Because it's like, everything doesn't cost. No, it does not.
01:25:07.68 --> 01:25:16.48 It barely costs you time, barely. Really the thing is remembering to go there. Yeah. So that's kind of a thing.
01:25:16.48 --> 01:25:23.04 A good solution to that. Yes, which we do have now. A little trooper tool. Trooper tool is what it's called.
01:25:23.04 --> 01:25:29.52 It's this cool little thing. And it's on the website as well. It says trooper tool chrome extension.
01:25:29.52 --> 01:25:34.40 Boom. Click on it. Put a little icon on the top of your browser and it automatically
01:25:35.84 --> 01:25:42.88 affiliates your Amazon experience with us support passes. Passively. Passively. No,
01:25:43.76 --> 01:25:49.36 passively as opposed to passively. No, no, no, it's aggressive. Yes. But it's not.
01:25:49.36 --> 01:25:55.84 Yeah. Passively means you didn't do anything. It's not. We have we have troopers out there that are
01:25:55.84 --> 01:26:02.72 aggressively shopping on Amazon to support the podcast and I dig that. Yep. I'd rather sometimes.
01:26:05.04 --> 01:26:11.36 My friends on Twitter. They'll send me like a screenshot. Boom. Of their trooper tool or their
01:26:11.36 --> 01:26:19.36 little purchase. Like, yeah, bought this stuff tape. Here's my fan. It's a screenshot. No. Yeah.
01:26:19.36 --> 01:26:26.48 It really makes me feel empowered and I'm not joking. Well, this does help the podcast. Yeah.
01:26:26.48 --> 01:26:32.88 So fully appreciate it. Really. Subscribe to the podcast. Of course, I tunes and then on YouTube.
01:26:32.88 --> 01:26:38.16 As well. I'm slowly playing more videos. I'll put a few and keep putting more.
01:26:38.16 --> 01:26:45.76 So you're not just stuck watching the podcast, which is cool too. By the way, if you're into watching it
01:26:46.64 --> 01:26:51.36 and listening is sometimes like people will put it on their screen as they work out. You know? So they
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:55.68 can kind of watch lists in workout. Watch lists, you know, it's a good little formula. You know,
01:26:55.68 --> 01:27:01.28 yeah, YouTube is a good one as well. And of course, the jocquistor. If you like,
01:27:01.28 --> 01:27:07.52 you know, shirts and whatnot, coffee mug stickers, they're pretty cool. I've got some great feedback.
01:27:09.28 --> 01:27:18.96 One announcement. We have women's stuff coming out. In about what a week or two.
01:27:20.72 --> 01:27:29.44 So yeah. So all the female troopers. Yeah. Who have been pressuring strongly recommend. Yeah. We'll say
01:27:29.44 --> 01:27:35.52 consistently strongly recommending. Yeah. Yeah. They're good ones. I chose three colors.
01:27:35.52 --> 01:27:40.56 You're going to have to wait and see which ones they are. And when they do come out, give me more
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:47.12 feedback. I want to narrow it down to the stuff that we all want. So yeah, go do that.
01:27:47.12 --> 01:27:52.32 Talk of store.com. There's some cool stuff. If you like it, boom, get one or two or however many
01:27:52.32 --> 01:27:56.96 and that supports as well. And plus that means I don't have to buy my wife anything.
01:27:56.96 --> 01:28:00.08 Yeah. I'll just give it. Yeah. I'll send one. I don't have the
01:28:00.08 --> 01:28:05.68 podcast. That's actually one of the good reasons I like managing this stuff. I don't have to
01:28:05.68 --> 01:28:10.80 not that I really butchered that much anyway, but I have a bunch of shirts now. Plus maybe my daughter
01:28:10.80 --> 01:28:16.64 is too. Yeah. Perfect. That's a good. You know, do you go? Everybody's good to go. Are they regular
01:28:16.64 --> 01:28:21.36 are they the same design? Or is it something new? Uh, it's there. Yeah, they're more or less the same.
01:28:21.36 --> 01:28:25.04 But they're, you know, they're based at the Williams version. Okay. Well, what we got,
01:28:25.04 --> 01:28:30.40 I started with a discipline equals freedom. I might just do one for women because let's face it.
01:28:30.40 --> 01:28:36.24 Like we all get get after it in pretty much the same way except for everyone's in a while. Women
01:28:36.24 --> 01:28:42.96 get after it in a different way. Everyone's in a while. So it might be worth it to get them
01:28:42.96 --> 01:28:49.84 a little some different, some special. Just my opinion. Awesome. All right. There you go. That's always
01:28:49.84 --> 01:29:02.24 a support support that podcast, yeah. And with that question. It's a great one. I am a Marine
01:29:02.24 --> 01:29:09.44 Corps vet. Only four years. And I recently hired another Marine. He had a great reputation and a lot
01:29:09.44 --> 01:29:16.72 of experience as NCO leader, Gunny Sergeant. But he's not doing well in our company. He only seems to
01:29:16.72 --> 01:29:23.52 lead through fear slash authority. It isn't working. He has high standards, which I like, but he's
01:29:23.52 --> 01:29:29.52 not gaining the respect of his team or the rest of the company. What's going on? And how can I fix it?
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.12 This is kind of a classic case. And unfortunately, it's an unfortunate case too. And what we have
01:29:39.68 --> 01:29:46.000 here is an example of a guy that's probably pretty charismatic. He's probably pretty aggressive.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.08 He's probably pretty loud. He's probably pretty authoritative. He's probably pretty smart. He's
01:29:50.08 --> 01:29:57.20 probably physically impressive. In other words, he's probably got a lot of natural good leadership traits.
01:29:58.80 --> 01:30:06.96 And I surmise in a situation like this that this is a type of person that took the basics of
01:30:06.96 --> 01:30:13.20 what the military taught him and utilized it to lead. And so what he did was he used
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:20.24 imposed discipline. That's what guy used on him. And that's what he used. So it's the things that we
01:30:20.24 --> 01:30:26.80 just talked about. It's intimidation. It's the whole thing with maneuver warfare versus a
01:30:26.80 --> 01:30:35.60 tristion warfare that the military still teaches. Unfortunately, that the job of leaders is to
01:30:35.60 --> 01:30:41.52 obey orders and ensure orders are obeyed. Okay. That's that's what the military, unfortunately,
01:30:41.52 --> 01:30:45.76 in some cases teaches. And you can go through your career. And that's what you can kind of learn.
01:30:45.76 --> 01:30:51.84 Or you can have some good leadership inside the military that teaches you the better way, the way to
01:30:51.84 --> 01:31:01.68 actually lead. And so, but if you're raised that the way that your job as a leader is to obey
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:06.80 orders and ensure that orders are obeyed. If that's your job, how do you do that? Well, you do it through
01:31:06.80 --> 01:31:16.08 blunt force trauma. That's how you do it. And as I've said before, that does work for a time period.
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:22.80 It does get the job done. It's micro management. And fortunately or unfortunately, in the military,
01:31:22.80 --> 01:31:30.72 you've got people that rapidly cycle through leadership positions. And so it's not like you are
01:31:30.72 --> 01:31:36.000 permanently in charge of the same group of people. So you can kind of get away with it because you do
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.28 a work up and it doesn't work up a stressful and then you go on deployment to tool it's only six
01:31:39.28 --> 01:31:42.96 months long. And by the time you're done, everybody hates you, but it's okay. You're moving on to your
01:31:42.96 --> 01:31:51.20 next job. And so that's how people survive. And what really hurts about this is because they survive
01:31:51.20 --> 01:31:57.44 that leadership position. It actually reinforces that type of leadership behavior, which is not good.
01:31:57.44 --> 01:32:04.96 But what they do is, if let's say you do, it just an American kind of mindset of, hey,
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:14.24 if some is good, more is better. And so they take this, this attitude and they become more
01:32:14.24 --> 01:32:19.44 more aggressive. They impose more discipline. They raise this standards to a ridiculous level.
01:32:19.44 --> 01:32:27.04 Where it's no longer even sensible. Where things just become stupid. Like we used to say,
01:32:27.04 --> 01:32:30.48 so I don't know why they call this, but in the military, they call the push-up position,
01:32:30.48 --> 01:32:37.12 the front leaning rest. Front leaning rest. I don't know why. But then they also use the term
01:32:37.12 --> 01:32:43.28 forward leaning. Meaning, hey, we want to be ahead. We want to be ready for a new prepared. And I used to say,
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:49.92 let's not be so far forward leaning that we're in the leaning rest. Meaning that we're leaning
01:32:49.92 --> 01:32:54.56 so far forward that we're wasting our energy and getting tired. And so at a certain point,
01:32:54.56 --> 01:32:59.44 it can become super. An example this would be like a uniform inspections.
01:32:59.44 --> 01:33:03.28 Like, okay, you got to have a square-to-a uniform. You know, you got to be able to break out
01:33:03.28 --> 01:33:09.20 uniform, look sharp. Well, if you do that every day, you're wasting time because it's not the most
01:33:09.20 --> 01:33:14.08 important thing. It does have a level of importance somewhere on the hierarchy of important things.
01:33:14.08 --> 01:33:21.04 Not real high, but there's some people, if you're a strict military disciplinary in,
01:33:21.04 --> 01:33:24.000 you might think I need to have a uniform inspection every single day, because my guys are going to
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.64 look the best. And so you got a bunch of guys that not only are they wasting time prepping their
01:33:28.64 --> 01:33:33.52 uniform and paying for the uniform get dry cleaned. And they're actually using their uniform so
01:33:33.52 --> 01:33:38.88 much, they're dressed uniform so much that they're providing wear and tear on it. And so it's just,
01:33:38.88 --> 01:33:46.32 it's just stupid. Doesn't make any sense. So that's what they do. These leaders that have been
01:33:46.32 --> 01:33:51.76 raised like that, they start to do it even more. And it just defeats its own purpose. And most
01:33:51.76 --> 01:33:59.36 important is that these leaders start to stifle free thought from their subordinates.
01:34:00.72 --> 01:34:07.60 And eventually, and this is even more critical, eventually they begin to stifle free thought from their own
01:34:07.60 --> 01:34:16.16 brain. And that's likely what happened in a situation like this. And you know, you got a guy that
01:34:16.16 --> 01:34:21.04 again was raised in this attitude and he took that attitude and he amplified that attitude and that
01:34:21.04 --> 01:34:25.92 is how he was successful and he amplified it even more. And he ends up now he breaks out of the
01:34:25.92 --> 01:34:29.76 brain core. Well, now it's not just a six month appointment. You got to lead people for years and
01:34:29.76 --> 01:34:35.28 years and years and you got to go from different various projects and all these personalities and
01:34:35.28 --> 01:34:41.12 and it's a more sensitive environment because it's in the civilian sector and lives aren't necessarily
01:34:41.12 --> 01:34:49.92 it's stake. And so what do you need to do? What what you need him to do? So that I'm talking to the
01:34:49.92 --> 01:34:55.60 leader that asked this question, what what can you do to help? Well, what you need that former
01:34:55.60 --> 01:35:05.12 marine gun resurgence to do, what you need him to see is that the next level of leadership, the
01:35:05.12 --> 01:35:16.16 next progression along the spectrum of leadership is not more of all that. It's actually less.
01:35:16.16 --> 01:35:22.32 It's not more imposed discipline on your troops. It's actually less. It's the troops having
01:35:22.32 --> 01:35:30.64 free thought and self discipline and it is not you leading more. It is actually you leading less.
01:35:32.08 --> 01:35:38.80 It is not you taking more ownership is you taking less ownership and your troops taking more
01:35:38.80 --> 01:35:48.32 ownership. It is him giving guidance, giving commanders intent and then stepping back.
01:35:49.12 --> 01:35:56.08 It is him not being the focus because a lot of times when you're in a leadership position that can be
01:35:56.08 --> 01:36:02.32 an ego feeder and all of a sudden you want to be the center of attention you want to be in the spotlight
01:36:02.32 --> 01:36:10.08 but you don't want to be that. You want to be less of that and it and I'm telling you.
01:36:10.08 --> 01:36:15.28 So that's what you got to do. You got to open his eyes to what the next level of leadership looks
01:36:15.28 --> 01:36:20.08 like. He's never had that opened for him and I'm going to tell you right now it's going to be
01:36:20.08 --> 01:36:24.96 hard to get him there because there's a good chance that he's a hard person to coach because
01:36:24.96 --> 01:36:31.52 he's been successful with the techniques that he learned and he has experience and that
01:36:31.52 --> 01:36:38.40 experience has strengthened his resolve and his belief and his leadership technique.
01:36:39.52 --> 01:36:44.32 It's it's a tough situation. So you're likely going to have to take an indirect approach.
01:36:44.88 --> 01:36:52.96 And so for instance here's a good one. Hey I was wondering you know who's going to take your place
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:56.96 when it's you know when it's time for promotion who you're grooming to fill your shoes.
01:36:56.96 --> 01:37:06.16 Because guess what he's not grooming anybody. Or you ask him how much time he's spending looking
01:37:06.80 --> 01:37:12.48 up and out at what's going on strategic as opposed to down and in at his own little element.
01:37:14.72 --> 01:37:20.80 And the other thing that you could do is assign him some higher level projects that actually pull
01:37:20.80 --> 01:37:29.68 him out of the micro management weeds and maybe even put him on projects with people that don't
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:36.72 micro manage and good leaders that lead in a good way put him on some kind of project with them so he can
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:45.12 see what that looks like. And obviously these are just some suggestions of approaches because you're
01:37:45.12 --> 01:37:55.36 probably going to have to you'll have to adapt those and figure out exactly how to walk him through
01:37:56.56 --> 01:38:01.36 to the end state which the end state the commander's intent for me is you want to teach him what the
01:38:01.36 --> 01:38:10.56 next what the next level the next advancement of leadership skill for him is and it's something
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:23.60 that's the opposite of what he learned so good challenge yeah yeah that that leading from authority
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:31.52 thing and fear and authority it's almost like it's so black and white where when someone does that it's so
01:38:31.52 --> 01:38:38.08 clear it's very clear and it's very addictive person because there's immediate gratification I told you to
01:38:38.08 --> 01:38:45.28 do it and then the kids he worked yeah it kind of takes less work to a lot of the time
01:38:45.28 --> 01:38:49.60 totally takes less work you don't have to invest in relationships you don't do invest in
01:38:49.60 --> 01:38:56.32 in indirect approaches on things of course it takes less work it's it's real simple yeah you can
01:38:56.32 --> 01:39:01.12 kind of give into your temper sometimes too yeah your temper's a little bit of a tool with that
01:39:01.12 --> 01:39:07.20 kind of the problem is over time these that type of leadership doesn't work you want to be
01:39:07.20 --> 01:39:12.40 with the beloved captain who never lost his temper who never yelled at his men and yet who would
01:39:12.40 --> 01:39:24.88 follow him into the fires of hell yeah next question if you had a leader at work we did not
01:39:24.88 --> 01:39:32.40 respect and know as ineffective and you've communicated that team yet when they see you they try to
01:39:32.40 --> 01:39:38.56 shake your hand how would you react and how would you deny their hands shake offering
01:39:40.40 --> 01:39:47.92 appreciate the feedback so um okay this is just off the mark right I mean all I hope I hope
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:52.32 people realize that this is no it's okay I mean I understand the reason I put this in there just because
01:39:53.60 --> 01:39:59.20 this is what we talked about earlier where you think man I'm holding the line and I'm holding the
01:39:59.20 --> 01:40:03.36 line and this is my expectations of a leader and you don't fit it so I'm gonna number one I'm
01:40:03.36 --> 01:40:08.40 gonna tell you number two if you try and shake my hand you're not getting right so that's what we
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:14.16 call an adversary relationship and it's not what we want how let me ask you this how is this going
01:40:14.16 --> 01:40:18.48 to help your cause to have an air adversary relationship with your boss how does it help your
01:40:18.48 --> 01:40:25.44 cause is he gonna listen you more or less is he gonna support you more or less will he give you what
01:40:25.44 --> 01:40:34.16 you want more or less which one you won't shake his hand and and you think he's gonna support you
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:42.64 in any way no and furthermore is he if you have an adversary relationship with your boss is he
01:40:42.64 --> 01:40:47.76 more likely to promote you into position where you can have more control over decisions for the team
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:56.08 and for your own future what do you think the answer to that is negative all those answers are obvious
01:40:56.08 --> 01:41:07.44 this whole concept is wrong our job is to build a relationship with our boss and honestly we
01:41:07.44 --> 01:41:13.76 have everyone else for that matter that's what we're trying to do straight up disrespecting the boss
01:41:13.76 --> 01:41:23.44 or again anyone is not gonna help our cause it's gonna hurt it now this doesn't mean that we're
01:41:23.44 --> 01:41:29.20 kissing ass this doesn't mean that we're folding it doesn't mean that we're weak this is this is
01:41:29.20 --> 01:41:34.64 this is the this is the challenge for me to convince people that want to be strong leaders that this
01:41:34.64 --> 01:41:43.60 doesn't mean that you are weak it actually takes more strength to control your emotions it takes
01:41:43.60 --> 01:41:50.56 more strength to remain professional it takes more strength to focus on the long term win
01:41:50.56 --> 01:42:01.52 and not the short term frustration it takes more strength to keep your ego in check and I would say
01:42:01.52 --> 01:42:10.48 that this whole question is a good is it is an indicator to me I might need to check my own ego
01:42:11.52 --> 01:42:19.52 okay am I critical of my boss am I critical because of my boss because I'm a little bit jealous is that possible
01:42:20.32 --> 01:42:26.000 am I critical of my boss because I think I deserve the job more than they do
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.76 do I think that my boss got lucky or he's a brown noiser or he's favored some way that's
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:38.24 why he got it and I'm gonna be better about it and therefore I'm not gonna respect him
01:42:39.36 --> 01:42:46.72 all the loose right there ego talking right full on ego talking so you got to put the ego in check
01:42:46.72 --> 01:42:51.36 you got to support the boss and you got to support the team then that's the best way to support the
01:42:51.36 --> 01:42:58.48 boss and support the team and the obvious caveat to this is if the boss is doing something that's
01:42:58.48 --> 01:43:03.92 illegal or a moral or an ethical then fine yeah of course absolutely you can call them out
01:43:05.04 --> 01:43:10.16 you can deny his handshake you can report him up the chain of command or to the authorities
01:43:10.80 --> 01:43:16.56 because if you're part of what he's doing and you know it then you're complicit in the activities
01:43:16.56 --> 01:43:24.32 so you're at risk anyways and it's the right thing to do so obviously in those cases yeah
01:43:24.32 --> 01:43:31.52 you you can hold your ground but borrowing those extreme circumstances what you want to do with your
01:43:31.52 --> 01:43:36.32 boss is build the relationship and again it's not just your boss it's your peers it's your chain
01:43:36.32 --> 01:43:44.16 of command up and down you want to build those relationships instead of breaking them yeah
01:43:44.16 --> 01:43:50.88 yeah it seems it's still not funny it's interesting how when you lay it out and I'm sure a lot
01:43:50.88 --> 01:43:57.92 it may be even when it's listening to this just hearing this question out loud it seems obvious you know
01:43:57.92 --> 01:44:03.28 but really you try to think about yourself in this situation yeah where yeah you don't like this
01:44:03.28 --> 01:44:08.96 guy and maybe he said some stuff to offend you even and you don't respect him obviously so yeah
01:44:08.96 --> 01:44:14.000 like you don't want to shake this guy's hand like how you feel is a lot of times what dictates
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.84 your behavior you know towards people and just otherwise so when you're in the situation this
01:44:19.84 --> 01:44:26.40 is kind of like it's so hard to be like yeah I don't respect his whole methods I don't like any of
01:44:26.40 --> 01:44:30.96 this stuff he's gonna come shake my hand it's so hard to be like sure and and do what you're talking
01:44:30.96 --> 01:44:36.08 about it can be put your ego and check put your emotions and yeah put your attitude and check
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:42.000 and just go hey boss how's it going today you know everything's going good here yeah
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.32 so I appreciate the support you've been given us there's one decision you made I was kind of
01:44:46.32 --> 01:44:49.76 wondering about I'd love to get love to pick your brain on and some point oh really
01:44:50.80 --> 01:44:57.20 whereas if I just go I don't want to shake your hand I hate you I basically disrespect you and I hate
01:44:57.20 --> 01:45:01.36 you and I hate you and not what you do decision you made over here as long as you can listen to me there's
01:45:01.36 --> 01:45:06.64 no chance there's no chance you're gonna wait you're gonna lose the argument yeah me when I go in there
01:45:06.64 --> 01:45:10.48 when I say boss how's it going yes yeah no problem hey I want to think I want to pick your
01:45:10.48 --> 01:45:14.72 brain about the decision you made over here is you gonna listen to me got a better chance still
01:45:14.72 --> 01:45:18.96 might say no but guess what I'm fighting along or I'm gonna outlast him I'm gonna outwork him I'm
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:24.08 out maneuver him yeah my boss is gonna do what I want him to do I know and yeah you gotta keep
01:45:24.08 --> 01:45:28.88 that in mind man yeah because when you're in it when you lose that little about it because really
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:32.64 that's what it is when you're shaking your hand and you're like in your head you're like I hate
01:45:32.64 --> 01:45:37.04 you I don't want to shake your hand shaking get your hand out of my feet your whole existence of
01:45:37.04 --> 01:45:41.76 your hand front of my face is an insult that's what you're thinking so if you shake it you lost that
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:46.96 battle and that that's bad right there for you that's a real bad it's it's very very
01:45:47.60 --> 01:45:53.76 yeah immature when yeah it just feels right at the at the time yeah if you got your emotions get
01:45:53.76 --> 01:45:58.80 all crazy if you're not being strategic that's it if you're not thinking about winning yeah and
01:45:58.80 --> 01:46:03.60 by no means you're not playing the game correctly I know that's it but the point is I
01:46:03.60 --> 01:46:08.32 understand you feel it's good if we say it out loud it's like oh my gosh it's so clear you know
01:46:08.32 --> 01:46:13.76 how I'm always asking you know what you you you just indicated to me something very obvious
01:46:13.76 --> 01:46:20.96 is that over time you know over time you get to you okay you go for a hard workout and you get to
01:46:20.96 --> 01:46:25.12 you look forward to the feeling afterwards of that yeah I did this hard workout there's some
01:46:25.12 --> 01:46:30.64 door fins or whatever I'm gonna tell you at some point I developed some sort of attitude
01:46:30.64 --> 01:46:36.56 where when I when I control myself and I make a good strategic move if it feels just as good
01:46:36.56 --> 01:46:42.08 yeah it feels way better than the short term oh man I really told him no no wrong answer you
01:46:42.08 --> 01:46:47.12 lost you want the battle lost the work idiot that's what I feel like if I make that mistake
01:46:47.12 --> 01:46:51.52 that's absolutely correct they only you've could you condition yourself to the whole process you
01:46:51.52 --> 01:46:55.68 know because you probably went through it a few times tasted the fruits you know winning the
01:46:55.68 --> 01:47:01.60 lot but so it's just with experience that exactly right exactly right so and there's ways you
01:47:01.60 --> 01:47:07.60 can kind of do that to yourself like I do if like even if you have like an ultimately when
01:47:07.60 --> 01:47:12.32 when you boil kind of your whole way of thinking down when you do have an ego that you think is like
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:17.92 a functional ego but use that ego to win the long word so like kind of like what I did with
01:47:17.92 --> 01:47:22.32 getting mad it's like no one can like my like no one's gonna tell me I have a little self esteem
01:47:22.32 --> 01:47:28.16 because really you know anger and grace is usually because a little self esteem so in this case you
01:47:28.16 --> 01:47:33.76 could be like hey if you ever facilitate that adversarial relationship where you don't shake his hand
01:47:33.76 --> 01:47:40.24 or you're like you want to as he said you've communicated that to him you have leader that you
01:47:40.24 --> 01:47:45.84 don't respect and you know is ineffective and you told them okay so keep that when you say stuff
01:47:45.84 --> 01:47:50.08 like that consider that is like your weakness like just tell yourself that what it is
01:47:50.08 --> 01:47:55.44 say that's your weakness but forgetting a long word and for and for showing your cards that
01:47:55.44 --> 01:48:00.24 showing your question yes yeah just it's this little internal thing you tell yourself
01:48:00.24 --> 01:48:05.28 and then just like how you're saying where you feel dumb any of you if your ego can't handle that
01:48:05.28 --> 01:48:10.32 can't handle all that then go I'll go back to my point that I said this doesn't mean you're weak
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:15.84 it means that you are winning yeah well flip it around as far as what you tell yourself like
01:48:15.84 --> 01:48:20.000 you know it feels weak to lose a small battle I understand but flip it around and say hey say it
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.20 is no if you win it at the expense of the long that means your weak say that to yourself and it'll
01:48:25.20 --> 01:48:29.36 get easier you know if you're rushing yourself if you lose the long-term battle you're
01:48:29.36 --> 01:48:37.36 even more weak yes that's the big weakness for the big weakness all right next question
01:48:38.72 --> 01:48:46.16 for the pilot cast what would a jacco school for boys and girls eight to sixteen years old
01:48:46.16 --> 01:48:52.64 should this be interesting what would that look like schedule subjects physical education
01:48:52.64 --> 01:48:59.04 so first of all I would love to do this and it's seriously one day I would I may do this
01:48:59.04 --> 01:49:09.20 Lord of the fly yes I I actually really do relate to kids for some reason and I think a school
01:49:09.20 --> 01:49:14.40 I think I could develop a school that would be awesome and outstanding and would produce
01:49:14.40 --> 01:49:29.44 really stable strong mentally capable children for the world so and so I was so happy when I saw
01:49:29.44 --> 01:49:35.20 this question and I've actually looked and I've actually I've actually pondered the ideas of you know
01:49:35.20 --> 01:49:40.32 buying a buying a piece of property you know what it would cost maybe getting some investors together
01:49:40.32 --> 01:49:44.48 that we're gonna build a skype up literally I've actually looked for property which is something
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:49.68 I do all the time but I've looked for property and said okay this would probably work so like a
01:49:49.68 --> 01:49:54.56 like almost like an extension school like in the little oh no like an academy like a school that you
01:49:54.56 --> 01:50:01.20 go to and you and we we what we could probably do is do like a instead of a hey you're going to go
01:50:01.20 --> 01:50:10.64 here from six grade to graduation you go for like one year you go one year here you go back to
01:50:10.64 --> 01:50:13.84 your regular school after you've been in the school for a year you're going back to your regular
01:50:13.84 --> 01:50:19.20 school you're going to totally dominate you're going to be number one you're going to learn so much
01:50:19.20 --> 01:50:24.40 more it's just going to be awesome so we would need to bring we wouldn't need to bring these young
01:50:25.20 --> 01:50:30.64 these these children into the school for for the entire time because you know you could go
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:38.96 back out of the regular world and overlay what you learned at the academy and you would just
01:50:38.96 --> 01:50:48.08 dominate and so yeah maybe I'll end up doing that someday and this schedule I mean I didn't spend that
01:50:48.08 --> 01:50:53.28 much time on it it doesn't really even take that much time to figure out because you know what we're
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:59.76 doing we're waking up very early in the morning we're doing our hardcore PT some kind of sports variety
01:50:59.76 --> 01:51:04.88 of sports guess what we're playing every sport you know baseball basketball swimming football
01:51:04.88 --> 01:51:09.60 soccer wrestling judo boxing we're going to do a little bit of everything that's going to happen
01:51:09.60 --> 01:51:14.48 really I mean obviously we're getting up at 430 we are up before the sun gets up I mean that's the
01:51:14.48 --> 01:51:22.56 way it is and then we get the knowledge so we go into the classrooms the classrooms I would get
01:51:22.56 --> 01:51:29.52 instructors that were full on engaged in what they're doing just in the game that love their subject
01:51:29.52 --> 01:51:36.08 and that can relate it's the world and most important because I think this is what's lacking
01:51:36.08 --> 01:51:43.36 sometimes most important through all the different knowledge courses or all the basic knowledge there
01:51:43.36 --> 01:51:52.24 would be a common thread that connects them all together because that's what I think people are missing
01:51:52.24 --> 01:52:00.80 that a lot I think we miss that that underlying theme of a few our educational system but I think
01:52:00.80 --> 01:52:05.92 when you connect everything they're more powerful like when you connect math the science to history
01:52:05.92 --> 01:52:11.36 to English to foreign language and you connect those to art in music and you connect there's
01:52:11.36 --> 01:52:16.56 some there because there are all those things if you look at history all those things are connected
01:52:16.56 --> 01:52:20.56 they're all connected but we don't make the connections and when you don't connect things they're
01:52:20.56 --> 01:52:27.04 weaker so I would force or I wouldn't you would have to force it you don't have to force it I would
01:52:28.88 --> 01:52:38.32 I would foster that thread through everything so that everything made sense in a big picture
01:52:38.32 --> 01:52:44.64 and that way when you get granular you're tying it into this overlying theme of civilization and
01:52:44.64 --> 01:52:51.52 the movement of the way things go through civilization now I'll tell you another piece of this
01:52:53.04 --> 01:52:58.72 you would learn vocational skills at my school a hundred percent you would learn carpenter you
01:52:58.72 --> 01:53:04.32 would learn how to do electrical wiring you would learn plumbing you would learn automotive
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:10.32 and repair you would learn all those things and guess what are you going to take those courses like I
01:53:10.32 --> 01:53:14.80 said this this court this school would probably only be a year long that's fine because guess what
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:21.60 you know long it takes to learn basic carpenter not real long are you know you're skilled carpenter
01:53:21.60 --> 01:53:27.92 no but I'm not looking to build skilled carpeters are you going to be ready to rewire a giant building
01:53:27.92 --> 01:53:33.52 a commercial building no but could you rewire a house likely it doesn't take that much time to
01:53:33.52 --> 01:53:40.32 learn that you won't be skilled at it but you have the knowledge same thing with plumbing and
01:53:40.32 --> 01:53:44.88 like I said the automotive so I so you would learn those vocational skills because we have people
01:53:44.88 --> 01:53:52.80 in America right now that don't know any that stuff and that's jacked up yeah even like when I was
01:53:52.80 --> 01:53:58.40 young my dad used to make us change our own oil you can you can go anywhere it takes like in
01:53:58.40 --> 01:54:03.28 way or 50 minutes but he's like no you change your own oil you got to know what to do with the oil you know
01:54:03.28 --> 01:54:07.36 there's this little process you can't just be rolling around and change flat tire even now I
01:54:07.36 --> 01:54:11.76 have to play I don't I don't culture play for flat tire because so I hadn't got to flat tire in
01:54:11.76 --> 01:54:16.96 long time I got to flat tire one day and actually recently I didn't get any kind of flat tire so none
01:54:16.96 --> 01:54:21.52 of the less but I change in every time because when I first got it after not having a flat tire for a
01:54:21.52 --> 01:54:27.84 while I thought oh man do I even remember how to do this I of course I did I remember how to do
01:54:27.84 --> 01:54:33.20 it's not that hard just like I said so there are people who don't know they get a flat tire and
01:54:33.20 --> 01:54:36.40 they're they're lost they're lost they're lost they're yeah they only have triple air whatever
01:54:36.40 --> 01:54:43.44 sure they get saved but if they can do them themselves you know so at my school you would learn
01:54:43.44 --> 01:54:50.40 those vocational skills and then on top of that you'd learn basic survival skills
01:54:51.36 --> 01:54:57.52 little hunting little fishing little gardening and planting and how to grow things grow food
01:54:57.52 --> 01:55:04.48 and your basics water fire and shelter you learn those so you'd be able to survive in an environment
01:55:04.48 --> 01:55:12.08 in any situation obviously with all those survival skills and the vocational skills and even the
01:55:12.08 --> 01:55:22.08 classroom knowledge skills there would be a a system of team building where you're going to be
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:28.96 doing things together as a team not only for your classes but also cleaning the place working together
01:55:28.96 --> 01:55:33.28 as a team and that's what they do in military boot camps all you do clean they turn cleaning
01:55:33.28 --> 01:55:41.92 into like a team building exercise so we would do that people would be in simple uniforms you
01:55:41.92 --> 01:55:50.16 know nothing too fancy obviously the nighttime would be the study of the martial arts
01:55:50.16 --> 01:56:00.48 and you would learn the basics of jujitsu boxing, moitai and wrestling and that's what my
01:56:00.48 --> 01:56:05.84 school would be like and there'd be some real discipline there and there would be real achievement
01:56:05.84 --> 01:56:11.44 and I think that anybody that spent one year in that school right there would have a
01:56:12.80 --> 01:56:20.08 infinitely greater chance of success and domination in whatever they feel they chose to go into
01:56:20.08 --> 01:56:25.76 and when they went back to their school to their regular school you know it's funny at first at first
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:30.000 thought when I'm here I'm kind of picturing this stuff or whatever and I'm sure I'm not the only
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.12 one listening to this where you're like oh shoot that probably that's a hardcore school you know they
01:56:35.12 --> 01:56:39.84 got to be ready to to get but then you know you want to go well when you think about it you're
01:56:39.84 --> 01:56:46.40 probably wouldn't be that hardcore in fact it'd probably be kind of fun given your approach to you know
01:56:46.40 --> 01:56:52.08 teaching or in leading and stuff like that because man I remember when I it was like when I first
01:56:52.08 --> 01:56:55.92 met you I met you and you don't remember when I first met you but so I kind of knew you were
01:56:55.92 --> 01:57:01.36 whatever little bit this was back at the boxing club and you came in first time I saw your kids
01:57:01.36 --> 01:57:05.52 door like Thor and I think one of his systems I forget I don't know which one I forget they're
01:57:05.52 --> 01:57:11.44 just little kids and you'd brought them or whatever and they come in the door and they just start
01:57:11.44 --> 01:57:16.08 running around like this is a big playground right? Psychopath right? Yeah hitting the bags and doing
01:57:16.08 --> 01:57:20.88 all this stuff right and then you had this look on your face kind of like it's almost like you
01:57:20.88 --> 01:57:24.72 had control of the situation but you're just gonna let them be them kind of thing and I remember
01:57:24.72 --> 01:57:29.04 just kind of kind of looking at like all this is interesting I never seen Jockel and his kids you know
01:57:29.04 --> 01:57:33.44 so let me so it's kind of just watching so decentralized command it was really the
01:57:34.24 --> 01:57:41.52 matter of speaking it so um do you just started kind of going on and I think you might even been teaching
01:57:41.52 --> 01:57:48.88 I don't know you're involved in some way and they got loud real quick and it kind of was like
01:57:48.88 --> 01:57:53.92 for like a better term kind of distracting and you like kind of stop what you're doing you were like
01:57:54.72 --> 01:58:01.44 you could stop that like real mean and then I was like let me see like how they react you know I look
01:58:01.44 --> 01:58:05.92 and then they stop they look at you like just just for maybe almost two seconds they look
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:10.08 you look at each other like that and they just start laughing and they keep going and they like
01:58:10.08 --> 01:58:15.52 you kind of started laughing at the same day I was like oh I see like you're probably strict but
01:58:16.08 --> 01:58:20.32 just not that's their kids you know they're doing kids stuff we want they're not breaking
01:58:20.32 --> 01:58:25.04 nothing yeah so it was like it's almost like they knew and then they knew beyond that you know
01:58:25.04 --> 01:58:30.80 like they knew what was ultimately up that was interesting well you know maybe we can put this
01:58:30.80 --> 01:58:36.000 school together at some point I know there's a lot of people that would love to send their kids
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.80 to a school like this on every and I would obviously I would send all my kids to school like this tomorrow
01:58:42.80 --> 01:58:49.36 if it existed yeah one year of the academy that's what it's called the academy I think it would
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:56.24 have to be you know a big part of it and I'm sure this would probably I'm sure this would
01:58:56.24 --> 01:59:03.52 would be implemented in the whole system is how the teachers and instructors are treated
01:59:03.52 --> 01:59:09.20 for sure you know like because I think that's a lot of the time anyway like one of the
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:13.68 many issues you know one that one issues come up in education it's like how are the teachers
01:59:14.80 --> 01:59:22.08 regarded yeah in that situation yeah man yeah good sign me up okay next question
01:59:23.36 --> 01:59:28.000 I'm about to accept a position across the country after changing the IT field I work in
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.04 I've just been accepted from my first job and in this type of position with the amount of
01:59:33.04 --> 01:59:39.44 responsibility I'll have and I'm not or I'm having some issues and some hesitations on if I'll be good enough
01:59:39.44 --> 01:59:44.32 have you ever been in a position before were you tried to bite off more than you can chew professionally
01:59:45.68 --> 01:59:50.88 how do you approach it and is there ever a time where you think it's best to bow out and quit and if so
01:59:52.32 --> 01:59:57.92 how do you know when that point is so actually most people get
01:59:57.92 --> 02:00:03.28 hired into leadership positions they haven't been in before the seal teams is all about that you
02:00:03.28 --> 02:00:08.88 get promoted you do that leadership job and just as you're getting the hang of it you get promoted again
02:00:10.40 --> 02:00:16.08 so there's nothing abnormal about feeling that you aren't quite ready for a leadership position
02:00:16.80 --> 02:00:23.60 and the reason that some people fail when they get to these positions that they're not ready for
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:28.72 is because they're nervous that they're going to show that and so they try to hide it
02:00:29.92 --> 02:00:34.88 they're afraid to ask questions they're afraid to say they don't know so they end up looking
02:00:35.68 --> 02:00:46.000 scared and stupid which equates to looking incompetent and I mean even just with the beloved
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.28 captain they they actually kicked off there's a reason this guy included those statements in there
02:00:51.28 --> 02:00:57.60 that he asked questions and asked for guidance and admitted his mistakes there's a reason that he was
02:00:57.60 --> 02:01:09.12 beloved that is one of the reasons and so so so that's what you got to do is
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:14.40 be okay with it don't try and hide it now to bow out and quit I have not done that
02:01:14.40 --> 02:01:21.76 but there's no reason to because if I don't know how to do something I have no problem asking
02:01:21.76 --> 02:01:27.60 for help up and down the chain of command up and down the chain of command nothing wrong with that
02:01:29.52 --> 02:01:32.96 and I've said this before that what what you're feeling
02:01:35.28 --> 02:01:39.60 person that asked this question what you're feeling that you aren't good enough and that you don't
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:46.16 want to blow at those are actually signs of humility and it's okay those are good I've felt those
02:01:46.16 --> 02:01:52.32 feelings my whole career and I still feel them now and when I was in the suit teams I would over
02:01:52.32 --> 02:01:56.88 prepare for things and it wasn't because I thought I was going to dominate it was because I thought I was
02:01:56.88 --> 02:02:06.24 going to fall short and even I was telling you I prepared for the podcast all yesterday I thought I was
02:02:06.24 --> 02:02:11.04 good literally had printed out my notes woke up this morning worked out and I was like no I'm not
02:02:11.04 --> 02:02:16.96 ready I over prepared for this why because in my mind I'm feeling I'm going to blow it
02:02:18.72 --> 02:02:25.12 and I don't like that but there's a thing it's like a for real thing it's called imposter syndrome
02:02:25.12 --> 02:02:29.76 you're you're heard that no but it's this and I think you know what I think I think everyone has
02:02:29.76 --> 02:02:35.84 it and it's in whether a teeny tiny bit or a lot it's where it's basically you feel this you feel like
02:02:36.56 --> 02:02:41.12 I'm re-like on the inside like I'm really not this good you can be like champion of the world
02:02:41.12 --> 02:02:45.04 on the inside you're like this just a matter of time before they find me out you know I don't know
02:02:45.04 --> 02:02:50.24 I don't deserve to be here whatever that I wish more people would have that because there's a lot of
02:02:50.24 --> 02:02:55.28 people that I know that have been in leadership positions that feel that they have the divine right
02:02:55.28 --> 02:03:01.04 yeah to be there a lot of times if they'll have it they'll behave in that oh they absolutely do
02:03:01.44 --> 02:03:09.12 that's why they fail that's crazy so rehash as always bottom line be humble
02:03:09.84 --> 02:03:16.88 study and learn what you can ask questions and if you don't know something admit it now I had to
02:03:16.88 --> 02:03:27.92 make this note and I'm cautious to even say this but I do have to say it asking questions doesn't just
02:03:27.92 --> 02:03:37.68 mean putting your ignorance on clear display all the time okay when you ask questions make sure you
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:46.72 are asking thoughtful meaningful questions it in fact if you can find out the answer on your own
02:03:46.72 --> 02:03:50.40 do that if it's something that you can refer back to and you can look up and you can go back and you can
02:03:50.40 --> 02:03:54.32 check out the work chart you can see where that department is or you can find out who's run in that
02:03:54.32 --> 02:04:03.84 project without having to ask that question do that because contrary to popular belief there actually
02:04:03.84 --> 02:04:09.44 is in fact such a thing as a stupid question and you can get away with it sometimes so you don't
02:04:09.44 --> 02:04:20.08 need to be hyper paranoid about it but you also part of leadership is confidence and up and down
02:04:20.08 --> 02:04:24.56 so you gotta have some confidence and you people have to have some confidence in you and if
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:32.72 if you don't know anything and you can't figure it out for you can't figure out some portions of that
02:04:32.72 --> 02:04:37.92 on your own that's not a good sign because I just expect if you're gonna be in charge of me
02:04:37.92 --> 02:04:42.24 that you couldn't look that up you didn't you didn't review this before you came in here I know you
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:46.96 don't know my job but you should at least know what the requirements of my job are you shouldn't
02:04:46.96 --> 02:04:52.32 at least know what the outcomes at a strategic level of my job are right you see what I'm saying
02:04:52.32 --> 02:05:01.04 there's a difference so you don't have to go in there and be overly humble you don't have to go in
02:05:01.04 --> 02:05:12.88 there and be overtly blank wide open with what you don't know because again I was cautious to make
02:05:12.88 --> 02:05:17.44 this note because this doesn't I you should feel comfortable enough saying hey I don't know how to do this
02:05:17.44 --> 02:05:21.36 or hey can you explain that the way that works to me can you explain what this project you know
02:05:21.36 --> 02:05:26.16 what this project entails there's nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with that but
02:05:26.16 --> 02:05:34.72 if you go into a room and you accidentally ask a question of something that everybody legitimately
02:05:34.72 --> 02:05:42.96 should know you're gonna look stupid that's a mistake that's a mistake and so don't do that it's
02:05:42.96 --> 02:05:50.64 okay be humble ask questions but ask thoughtful questions meaning for questions that you don't know
02:05:50.64 --> 02:05:56.72 because it's it would be pretty difficult for you to know the answer yeah yeah it's I mean it
02:05:56.72 --> 02:06:01.28 kind of seems obvious when you say it out loud where you're not gonna know everything no so that
02:06:01.28 --> 02:06:07.44 makes sense but you gotta know something you gotta be there for reason you can't be like hey I don't
02:06:07.44 --> 02:06:10.96 know nothing I shouldn't be hearing you and that's another thing from the beloved captain where he
02:06:10.96 --> 02:06:16.88 says for a few days he didn't do anything yes what if you can observe for a few days you're probably
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:22.40 gonna answer a bunch of questions just for observation and taking notes and getting back and maybe
02:06:22.40 --> 02:06:30.08 conferring with your trusted agent or your senior enlisted guy or your your superintendent you
02:06:30.08 --> 02:06:36.80 can confer directly with them and keep that build that relationship while your garnering information
02:06:36.80 --> 02:06:45.84 mm-hmm yeah don't be that guy try not to yes yeah try not to
02:06:46.88 --> 02:06:54.80 jockel how do I take ownership of mixed messages to the people under me from the other leaders in my group
02:06:55.60 --> 02:07:01.68 pretty straightforward question I like it well first of all you have to address this straight up with
02:07:01.68 --> 02:07:07.04 the other leaders in your group because if you aren't aligned as a leadership team this is gonna
02:07:07.04 --> 02:07:12.16 hurt the cause it is absolutely gonna hurt the cause this is critical and it's gonna be hard
02:07:12.16 --> 02:07:17.60 and there are some things in your group that people do not agree on and that is why they are
02:07:17.60 --> 02:07:22.72 undermining the messaging or why they're giving out different messaging because they don't agree
02:07:22.72 --> 02:07:27.04 with it they don't have the courage to stand up and say hey I don't agree with this right here so
02:07:27.04 --> 02:07:30.32 let's do it a different way here's my thoughts they don't have the courage to that so what do they
02:07:30.32 --> 02:07:34.88 do they just sit back and then when it comes time to put out the word they put out the mixed messages
02:07:34.88 --> 02:07:40.32 and it's it's a bad situation and you actually have to lead here that's what you have to do and
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:47.44 it shouldn't actually be that hard because what you're asking for is something that anybody can tell
02:07:47.44 --> 02:07:52.96 is important so you know you said you say your leadership team you go hey guys our message to the
02:07:52.96 --> 02:07:58.16 troops needs to be aligned and right now it isn't we need to fix that is there anyone on your
02:07:58.16 --> 02:08:02.32 leadership team is gonna disagree with that no they won't that's not what they disagree with they
02:08:02.32 --> 02:08:07.36 everybody knows that the leadership team has to have an aligned message they have to be on the same
02:08:07.36 --> 02:08:14.64 sheet of music and that's what you need to do and and again it's gonna be a hard conversation
02:08:15.60 --> 02:08:20.64 it's gonna bring out that statement should bring out the conversation of what people don't
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:30.80 agree on and why they're sending messages now if you if you cannot get them aligned it is a
02:08:30.80 --> 02:08:40.72 serious problem but if you can't the best thing you can do is mitigate mitigate that to your team
02:08:41.36 --> 02:08:47.12 by becoming the trusted voice so so with your team you want to become the trusted voice now
02:08:47.12 --> 02:08:52.40 you doesn't mean that you're going to undermine your other leaders it's a echo came in here
02:08:52.40 --> 02:08:55.52 he doesn't know what he's talking about no no that's not what I'm talking about I'm never
02:08:56.64 --> 02:09:02.96 almost never talking about undermining another leader or a leadership team what I'm going to do
02:09:02.96 --> 02:09:08.96 though is I'm going to translate I'm gonna say hey guys our job on this I know echo said that here's
02:09:08.96 --> 02:09:15.28 our job here's here's what our focus needs to be here's the way this translates for us so I'm not
02:09:15.28 --> 02:09:21.44 disparaging you and I'm not even disagreeing with you I'm simply honing the message for my team
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:29.36 now you still even if you need to do that you're mitigating that as much as possible you
02:09:29.36 --> 02:09:36.48 still have to maintain the critical goal of getting your leadership team aligned and one other
02:09:36.48 --> 02:09:44.88 little tool to help make that happen is to present their words back to them and you said you know
02:09:44.88 --> 02:09:48.80 I wrote down what you said to the team this morning and I just wanted to go through that with you
02:09:48.80 --> 02:09:56.32 and break it down a little bit and then go through it line by line and have the hard conversations
02:09:56.32 --> 02:10:04.80 and make the tough decisions you've got to make the tough decisions and also give a little
02:10:04.80 --> 02:10:15.84 seed some points right be flexible but unify unify the message and there's a worse number
02:10:15.84 --> 02:10:20.40 worst case nearer but there are scenarios where echo and I cannot agree on the message and we
02:10:20.40 --> 02:10:26.40 got to go up the chain of command now I would never want to do that I would never ever want to say to my
02:10:26.40 --> 02:10:32.40 boss hey echo and I can agree you need to make the decision for us to me that's a total failure
02:10:32.40 --> 02:10:39.12 it's a failure in my leadership that I can't get us on the same sheet of music so I don't I can't even
02:10:39.12 --> 02:10:44.32 think of any time that I ever did that went to my boss and said hey boss I can't we you know I can't
02:10:44.32 --> 02:10:48.16 come to a come to a conclusion here with the other task you need to commander so I can't come to a
02:10:48.16 --> 02:10:53.44 conclusion with the other pertune commanders or I can't come to a conclusion with my squad about
02:10:53.44 --> 02:10:58.08 how we should do this I've never done that so you should be able to if you're right you'll win the
02:10:58.08 --> 02:11:01.84 argument and if you're wrong then you change your mind so it's not that it's not like this
02:11:01.84 --> 02:11:06.96 ultimate I like I'm saying I'm great I'm just saying if you're right then you'll win the argument
02:11:06.96 --> 02:11:12.32 and if you're wrong then you'll change your mind so it's not that hard so that's what happens
02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:17.84 needs to happen here with the leadership team we've got to find out who's right and people that are
02:11:17.84 --> 02:11:24.48 right need to convince that people that are wrong now you need to check your ego obviously
02:11:24.48 --> 02:11:29.04 cross the board every team everybody on the teams got to check the ego because a lot of people will
02:11:29.04 --> 02:11:35.84 be holding on to their idea because it's their idea and they love their idea because there's
02:11:35.84 --> 02:11:45.04 egotistical and that's how I would deal with mixed messages coming down the chain of command
02:11:45.76 --> 02:11:50.16 I'm gonna go ahead and just say it that that could have been one of the best lines I've ever heard
02:11:50.16 --> 02:11:56.16 if you're right you'll win the argument if you're wrong you'll change your mind that's a good
02:11:56.16 --> 02:12:01.20 that's a good one you just think that up I did just make it up yeah I mean I guess it's
02:12:01.20 --> 02:12:06.64 something that I've known but right that's what makes it so good because you kind of kind of
02:12:06.64 --> 02:12:11.36 seems like oh yeah you don't write but that's never the case but if you're being on the
02:12:11.36 --> 02:12:20.96 up and up there it is right there there you go echo likes that one we got time for about one more
02:12:21.52 --> 02:12:33.04 I don't see why not juggle you often talk about being on the path what path is that and where does it lead
02:12:33.04 --> 02:12:48.56 I guess the path well I can tell you what path I'm on and what path I strive to stay on
02:12:48.56 --> 02:13:00.24 and that is the war path that that's the path I'm on the war path of war
02:13:03.52 --> 02:13:11.84 because to me war path means moving toward a battle a fight towards war
02:13:11.84 --> 02:13:19.44 and that is what I am doing and that's what I've always been doing
02:13:21.20 --> 02:13:32.48 whether it was the actual war against our nations enemies or the war against my own weaknesses
02:13:32.48 --> 02:13:46.08 that is what I am doing preparing and sharpening my sword and honing my skills and maintaining
02:13:46.96 --> 02:13:59.36 the unmedicated daily discipline in all things and the war path is just that it's a path
02:13:59.36 --> 02:14:09.44 it's a route it leads somewhere and so you ask okay then where does it lead
02:14:11.44 --> 02:14:19.12 and yes yes it can lead to war and that's fine
02:14:19.12 --> 02:14:37.76 in fact I am waiting and I am ready because the war path is a war against weakness and so it leads to strength
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:50.24 it's a war against ignorance and so it leads to knowledge it's a war against confusion
02:14:52.80 --> 02:15:04.64 and so it delivers understanding and the path the war path leads to
02:15:04.64 --> 02:15:19.84 control and leads to ownership of your life and that to me is the war path the path of fire
02:15:20.64 --> 02:15:25.68 and adversity the path of blood and of sweat and of suffering
02:15:25.68 --> 02:15:39.60 the war path is the preeminent path of discipline which is why it leads to freedom
02:15:39.60 --> 02:15:55.12 and beyond that in the end the war path it leads to peace
02:15:58.64 --> 02:16:09.04 and I think that's all I've got for the night so thanks everyone out there for taking the time to
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:18.16 listen to this this little podcast we put together and if you like it then you want to support it
02:16:19.76 --> 02:16:27.60 echo and they do that if you're in the mood if you work out
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:33.76 and I heard this before but if you work out and you want supplements that actually work
02:16:33.76 --> 02:16:37.92 because supplement industry you probably know this bro they can put whatever they want
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:44.000 and there's no regulation yeah you can I don't know if it was a documentary it's something like
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.52 that word a guy just put chalk that's all it was chalk and there he was like hey look protein powder
02:16:49.52 --> 02:16:56.000 sell it and either he found there was like there was no regulation saying he couldn't do it technically
02:16:56.64 --> 02:17:01.68 anyway this is the whole one thing nonetheless if you want for real ones it's actually not a bad
02:17:01.68 --> 02:17:08.40 product idea we could make protein powder that you can use as chalk so you could be chalking up and
02:17:08.40 --> 02:17:15.76 then eating yeah good no yeah yeah maybe you get on it to make the protein powder chalk up
02:17:16.48 --> 02:17:22.80 yeah that's that's a little bit different from what I was kind of saying but nonetheless if you
02:17:22.80 --> 02:17:27.52 go to on it dot com slash juggle you can get 10% off their their supplements anyway my point
02:17:27.52 --> 02:17:32.80 being with that story is that their supplements are all like legit and you can even read like about
02:17:32.80 --> 02:17:38.32 it like their peel oil I said this before I feel like I said this before but you can see like how
02:17:38.32 --> 02:17:44.32 they harvest them they use like eco friendly boats like it's like it's basically the ones you want
02:17:44.32 --> 02:17:49.44 to go boats no like the engines are like eco friendly and you know like that kind of stuff
02:17:49.44 --> 02:17:54.72 anyway I was watching it you can get it dusted on there but yeah all legit warrior bars
02:17:54.72 --> 02:17:59.44 I feel like we haven't really talked about it in by the way I got asked by somebody on Twitter the
02:17:59.44 --> 02:18:03.84 other day what you know hey my joints are hurting what I take take roll oil that's it man take
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:10.56 roll oil yeah I've been using kerala oil for a really long time I'm 44 years old I'm almost 45
02:18:10.56 --> 02:18:19.60 years old actually and my joints are doing solid and knock on wood you know I had some joint pain
02:18:19.60 --> 02:18:26.64 in the past and when I started taking kerala oil I'm talking 10 maybe even longer years ago
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:34.96 the it's I definitely attributed to helping me and also also the one goes to me yeah
02:18:34.96 --> 02:18:43.20 so and that's saying a lot because your big you're a big guy 235 not exactly flexible
02:18:43.20 --> 02:18:52.56 I'm not the most flexible person and I do like that heavy duty stuff I mean get after it
02:18:52.56 --> 02:19:00.56 not as much as I want to and not as much as I should but I try I try to to work out hard
02:19:00.56 --> 02:19:08.64 I train to jitsu I surf I run I sprint I just do all kinds of activities and before
02:19:08.64 --> 02:19:15.36 up until several years ago I was in the military I was in the sealed teams and I was running around
02:19:15.36 --> 02:19:22.64 doing all that crap for my whole life and so yeah I would say order up some kerala oil
02:19:22.64 --> 02:19:29.04 but just saying just doing jitsu alone especially as much as you do it that alone old young whatever
02:19:29.60 --> 02:19:35.76 just doing and you're like my joints are fine if you're in that situation to about that alone yeah
02:19:35.76 --> 02:19:42.24 and and the kerala oil for sure and also I believe that working out period is very helpful
02:19:42.24 --> 02:19:48.96 in staying injury free because I always work out and therefore I'm always moving and therefore
02:19:48.96 --> 02:19:56.48 my joints are getting rusty you know but do both right do both yeah I do get injured you know
02:19:56.48 --> 02:20:03.60 I had the finger injury which is a better now pretty good right now I had I had my shoulder got
02:20:03.60 --> 02:20:08.16 tweaked a little bit yeah but that's the situation that's not me from rolling yeah and that's not
02:20:08.16 --> 02:20:13.12 the kind hey I should have took more krill oil yeah it's not that it's like when you wake up or when
02:20:13.12 --> 02:20:16.72 you when you're like hey I'm gonna go out you start working I don't know I got to warm up some more
02:20:16.72 --> 02:20:22.08 some more you know and I take just FYI I take three of the 500
02:20:23.28 --> 02:20:29.68 milligram would be capsules morning and three at night so that's a lot of thousand a day
02:20:29.68 --> 02:20:36.24 yeah dang well hey there you go then do that then I mean like I said you're a big tank that needs more

02:23:30.40 --> 02:23:35.28 something make it be important yeah at least something that I honestly think that you'll be
02:23:35.28 --> 02:23:40.56 interested yes yeah honestly I'm gonna put some thought into that so yeah there it is that's the
02:23:40.56 --> 02:23:49.36 list now in the very very near future like I'm talking maybe a week sure and it's by early
02:23:49.36 --> 02:23:57.12 September 2016 you will be able to order jockel like tea mama granted and you'll be able to order
02:23:57.12 --> 02:24:04.08 it from amazon which is good to go and I got my first batch in and it's not coming drinking a little
02:24:04.08 --> 02:24:10.80 bit of that stuff right now yeah and it's it definitely puts you in the zone
02:24:12.32 --> 02:24:18.96 low place I like to call the assault zone it gets you there so look for it this is you know if
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:24.24 you heard that first podcast with tempers and he was like what is this adrenaline field drink
02:24:24.24 --> 02:24:30.56 it was white tea and white tea is not loaded with caffeine there's other stuff in there there's magic
02:24:30.56 --> 02:24:38.000 in there there's antioxidants in there it tastes good and anyways so that's common you be able
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.20 to order it we're kind of wondering I'm kind of wanting to see if people want jockel white tea
02:24:43.20 --> 02:24:51.04 I think they do yeah and we will find out shortly I know I do yeah it's that's the interesting thing
02:24:52.32 --> 02:24:56.72 because you know like just kind of on the surface we're like a fuck what's jockel into
02:24:56.72 --> 02:25:03.68 it's not like you know something creates like something it looks like it sounds kind of delicate you know
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:09.36 white tea well when you see the can that it comes in it's not delicate it's not delicate it's weird
02:25:09.36 --> 02:25:13.20 because I was trying to think of where I discovered it and I actually don't know I actually can't
02:25:13.20 --> 02:25:20.32 remember how why drank it for the first time but when I started drinking I was like oh yeah this
02:25:20.32 --> 02:25:25.44 stuff feels good especially when you're under stress or there's a lack of sleep or
02:25:25.44 --> 02:25:33.92 you need to be mentally sharp it's the deal but you can mix white tea with it'll mess up the taste
02:25:33.92 --> 02:25:41.68 but you mix jockel white tea with elphabrine I've done it I've done it I've done it here in the podcast
02:25:42.32 --> 02:25:48.64 yeah it doesn't mess up the taste it tastes good dang all right well the white tea is is a
02:25:49.04 --> 02:25:55.20 it's not like this super harsh taste it's a it's a it's a not mild because you can taste it
02:25:55.20 --> 02:26:01.28 you can kind of feel it too light yeah it's a light but heavy it's a I don't even know how to describe it
02:26:01.92 --> 02:26:08.16 it's just not it's not a heavy taste yeah so you can mix it with a lot of stuff and you can like I
02:26:08.16 --> 02:26:13.44 said you can be able to get that on Amazon so you click through the get it on Amazon you can also go
02:26:13.44 --> 02:26:20.24 and get by the little book called extreme ownership when you're there yeah and you can get that anywhere

02:28:04.08 --> 02:28:10.88 but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna basically have a due to situation happening at the gym so the
02:28:10.88 --> 02:28:15.68 event is Thursday Friday so maybe it's gonna be Wednesday night if people come in early maybe it's

02:28:46.72 --> 02:28:52.40 we might not be able to do it Thursday night because it's a packed schedule doesn't end
02:28:52.40 --> 02:29:00.48 until late at night but either Wednesday night or probably probably once the monsters over because
02:29:01.36 --> 02:29:05.84 head into the monster I'm gonna be like yeah actually I think we're gonna I haven't event

02:29:38.56 --> 02:29:46.56 and they just let him in too of course yeah yeah also hey look I know that the monster is expensive
02:29:47.68 --> 02:29:52.40 and in this situation guess what it costs money to put it on it costs money for the hotel room
02:29:52.40 --> 02:29:59.36 the event the event room the food the AV equipment the security logistics all that stuff
02:29:59.36 --> 02:30:06.32 it costs money and the reason that we're investing in it is because we want it to be the best
02:30:06.32 --> 02:30:12.80 we want it to be the best event that you have ever been to that's what I want that's all
02:30:13.60 --> 02:30:20.64 and but that does cost money and so if you can't afford to come out to it you know what
