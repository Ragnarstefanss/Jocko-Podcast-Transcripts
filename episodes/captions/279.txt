[00:00:00] This is Jockel Pondcast number 279 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:06] echo. Good evening.
[00:00:10] Helicopter blades slashed through the hot sky. The roar of engines
[00:00:16] deafening as the pilot twisted and turned on our final approach.
[00:00:20] Crammed into the back with my man, I tried to keep my balance by
[00:00:24] tensing my legs and focusing my gaze on the machine gun and the helicopter's door.
[00:00:28] My kit was heavy on my shoulders and sweat poured into my eyes from under the rim of my helmet.
[00:00:34] My palms were wet as they gripped the rifle. I pulled the closer to my chest and prepared
[00:00:40] myself for what was to come. The airman behind the machine gun turned to me. His face was
[00:00:46] covered by a scarf and the dark visor of his helmet, but I knew what he it meant when he
[00:00:51] held up his index finger. I turned and shouted to my man, one minute, one minute to landing
[00:01:01] and whatever was waiting there for us. Looking into the eyes of my young soldiers, I saw
[00:01:09] steely resolve the hardness of the paratrooper flying into battle. I was closest to the rear door
[00:01:17] which was now winching fully open. There was no doubt my mind that I had to be the first one
[00:01:22] down the ramp. I had waited years for this moment and now was my time. I'd practiced it over and
[00:01:30] over again on grass fields, in mock-up structures and on the real things during exercises all over
[00:01:36] the world, but this was different. For the first time in my life, I was flying into war.
[00:01:43] Our mission was a simple one to kill or capture a Taliban bomb maker. A bomb maker called
[00:01:54] Hajji Mohamed infamous for making the improvised bombs that were responsible for the deaths of
[00:02:00] dozens of British and Allied soldiers. We'd spent a week pouring over maps and aerial photographs
[00:02:08] of the village in which he was thought to live. My platoon, number eight platoon, on attachment to
[00:02:14] a company of the third battalion of the parachute regiment, was given the honor of landing first,
[00:02:20] right in Hajji Mohamed's back garden. It was our task to surround his house. It was a dangerous
[00:02:28] mission, but as the second counted down and I looked out the rear of the door of the helicopter
[00:02:33] towards the dusty plains below, I felt the tremendous sensation of both trepidation and sheer
[00:02:38] excitement. It was a lot of responsibility to shoulder, but I wanted to carry it.
[00:02:46] The helicopter got closer to the ground, whipping the Afghan dust into the air until it was
[00:02:51] a thick cloud around us. Ten seconds shouted the airman, holding tightly to a rope. The door
[00:02:58] was now fully open. The ramp hit the floor with a clunk and a shutter went through the airframe
[00:03:04] as the wheels touch down. Everyone wobbled but kept their feet. They knew how important it was
[00:03:10] to stay upright and get off the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the hea- the
[00:03:14] the Taliban had spies everywhere, scouts that reported the movement of helicopters. Every second
[00:03:20] that we delayed detaining was a second for the enemy to train their weapons and kill those on the ramp.
[00:03:30] My self and my man picking up the call so that it rippled through the aircraft.
[00:03:36] And then we were running, greeting our teeth as though that would stop the bullets that may
[00:03:40] await us. My feet touch down on the Afghan soil and I breathed in the dirt as I ran through the
[00:03:46] cloud that the helicopters blades stirred up all around us. My rifle was up at eye level and I
[00:03:51] looked over my sights ready to snap shoot anyone that posed a threat to my men. My soldiers followed
[00:03:56] me. I felt like a giant leading them from a metal beast into the jaws of death.
[00:04:05] Except that when the helicopter lifted away and the dust settled, we were quite alone.
[00:04:10] Nobody home. Shit. I put someone my men into defensive positions and took others with me to
[00:04:20] search the house. This was still a dangerous time as the Taliban were not above booby trapping their own homes.
[00:04:28] Other than a few sacks of opium, the drug of choice in those parts we found nothing.
[00:04:34] I walked back outside and was shrugging off the disappointment of another quiet mission
[00:04:39] when a whip-like sound echoed across the fields followed immediately by a crack.
[00:04:46] It wasn't the noise you hear in the films. It was all together more visceral and unnerving.
[00:04:53] Incoming shouted my platoon sergeant. I shouted at the men to jump into a nearby ditch and
[00:04:57] return fire. They looked at me unbelieving. It was like being on an exercise on the salt's
[00:05:04] buried plain except the noises were not the dull simulator. We'd been accustomed to. These were
[00:05:10] real and violent. Somebody was shooting with the evident intention of killing us.
[00:05:19] 300 meters away, I saw the enemy moving in a line of trees. I took aim and fired.
[00:05:24] It was the start of a very long day. And that right there is an excerpt from a book called
[00:05:41] the Art of Exploration by a former British Army officer named Levison Wood who served in
[00:05:49] lead combat operations in Afghanistan. But who seemed to have found an equivalent level of
[00:05:56] excitement and danger as a writer for Tografer filmmaker and explorer. And we're lucky enough to
[00:06:05] have him on the show tonight to share some of his experiences with us. Levison, thanks for coming on, man.
[00:06:14] Thanks for having me. That's a good way to start this thing off. Bring back some memories, hey?
[00:06:21] For again, good way to kick it off. Before we jump into your your career in the army,
[00:06:29] let's let's start at the beginning. Let's start about, let's talk about your child's childhood and
[00:06:34] you grow up in England. Sure. Yeah. Stoke on Trent. That's it. Not many people have heard of it.
[00:06:41] And that's where you actually grew up. Yeah. So I was born and raised in a small village just outside
[00:06:48] of Stoke on Trent, right in the middle of England, sort of halfway between Manchester and Birmingham,
[00:06:52] kind of place that not many people sort of travel to. They just travel past it. And I think it was
[00:06:59] it was for that reason that I was always from a very young age curious about the outside world.
[00:07:04] I was very keen to get away from Stoke on Trent. It will always be home, but yeah, from up from
[00:07:10] a very early age, I was always excited by the prospect of traveling out into the big wide world.
[00:07:16] It was something that not many members of my family had done. But I always knew that there was
[00:07:22] more to life than the provincial sort of suburbs of my hometown and that's one inspired me.
[00:07:27] And Stoke on Trent, that's a city where you're in, I guess it was prior to the pits shutting
[00:07:33] down. You were in the pits or there's a giant pottery factory, right? Yeah. Isn't it famous for
[00:07:39] making pottery? Stoke on Trent is the heart of the British ceramic industry. It has been for
[00:07:45] for centuries. And sadly, you know, a lot of those industries, the mines and the pottery industry
[00:07:52] died a bit of a death through the mid-20th century. So there was a lot of unemployment. There was a lot
[00:07:56] of poverty in Stoke on Trent in the 80s when I grew up. And so there weren't that many opportunities.
[00:08:02] Not many people had the opportunities to travel very much. But I was very fortunate to be
[00:08:06] grown up in a family of teachers, both my parents were teachers. They encouraged this spirit
[00:08:11] of curiosity. And encouraged me to read a lot. So I read as a young star at all about history,
[00:08:17] geography, travels, all those stories of exploration of those very hairy men in the 19th century
[00:08:24] that went to the polls, living stone and shackle-turn and scot. And those are my heroes. So it
[00:08:30] was growing up, my dad read me a lot of books about exploration, Lawrence of Arabia, people like that.
[00:08:35] And so I think from about the age of seven or eight, I was determined to somehow follow in their
[00:08:41] footsteps, which wasn't exactly a very realistic sort of thing to go to my careers officer
[00:08:47] or say I want to be an explorer. But that's exactly what I did. And he sort of laughed at me and said,
[00:08:51] okay, well, let's see. Well, I'm kind of thinking you must have been even in a worse position than me.
[00:08:55] So when I was a little kid, you know, I like rock and roll music. And so when I started playing guitar
[00:09:00] and thinking, okay, I'm going to write some riffs. But it didn't take me very long to figure out that,
[00:09:06] hey, all the, you know, if Jimmy Page already wrote that riff and Tony, I owe me already wrote those riffs.
[00:09:11] So what am I going to do? How am I going to write better riffs than those guys? So you had to be even
[00:09:15] in a worse position because the way you would explode. Yeah, actually you can make up new riffs. That's possible.
[00:09:22] But you know, the most of the known world has been explored. Yeah. So you're, you're in a worse
[00:09:28] part than I was in. Well, my, you know, I grew up with those stories. But I was also encouraged by
[00:09:33] stories of my grandfather. My granddad was a soldier in in the British army. He served in
[00:09:40] India and Burma and the Far East, fighting against the Japanese. And he told me these stories,
[00:09:46] which felt whilst it was still a long time ago, actually to hear them firsthand, somebody who'd
[00:09:52] been to the jungles of India who'd been to the mountains of, of, of East Asia. That was like my
[00:09:58] blog for me as a kid who'd never really traveled beyond the confines of the United Kingdom. So that's what
[00:10:05] I wanted to do. I wanted to go and see, not necessarily go with my Pythelmit and sort of cocky
[00:10:08] shorts and with a big union flag. But but at the very least, to go and see with my own eyes, the
[00:10:14] the kind of places that very few people had had traveled to within my own social circle, really.
[00:10:20] So it started pretty humbly and I'm just going off backpacking and, you know, doing what a lot
[00:10:25] of youngsters do and and travel around the world on a tight budget. And that was what I was determined
[00:10:30] to do from from a very young age. Now, what was your relationship with your grandfather? How long
[00:10:35] was this he saw alive today? No, he's not. So he passed away when I was about 18. So, you know,
[00:10:40] but growing up it was like, say it was those really exciting stories and pretty gruesome stories.
[00:10:46] I know. Like if you were in Burma fight with the Japanese, good Lord. Yeah, and he was not only that,
[00:10:53] he was on pretty much one of the first ships into Japan. He was part of the occupying force in
[00:10:57] Japan. He was based in Hiroshima after they dropped the A-bomb. So some of his stories were just like,
[00:11:03] you know, crazy. Yeah. And what about your dad, did your dad, um, wasn't your dad in the army as
[00:11:09] well? So my dad was in the, he was a reservist. So, you know, throughout the 70s and 80s, you know, his
[00:11:15] period, it was, it was the Cold War. So he, you know, he likes to tell me he was off fighting the Russians
[00:11:20] and Germany, you know, it, it, it really, you know, realistically he was, he was out there.
[00:11:25] A lot of digging trenches on the plains of Germany, but obviously no, no actual fighting. But,
[00:11:30] but yeah, he always encouraged me to, to take an interest in the military. And, um, it was
[00:11:36] things like, you know, he was a cadet instructor and so on. So I remember growing up, you know,
[00:11:40] he'd sometimes bring his rifles back over and things like that. And, uh, as a kid, he'd give me a
[00:11:46] uniform and if I was, if I was a good, good kid, he'd give me an extra striped for, and if I was
[00:11:51] naughty, he'd hit, hit, hit, hit, what off my arm? So that's kind of, that was how I grew up. Yeah.
[00:11:56] And, what, when you, um, were you a, you're saying that you're reading all the time?
[00:12:00] Mm-hmm. Does that mean you were a good student?
[00:12:02] I was, I think I, I was always curious and, and that helps. I think that's a good stuff.
[00:12:06] You might be the first person on the podcast. That was a good thing.
[00:12:08] We ever had any good students on here?
[00:12:10] Everyone's never just bad students, myself included.
[00:12:14] So, so you were reading and you're doing pretty good in school. Your parents were,
[00:12:18] so both my parents were teachers as well. She'll, yeah.
[00:12:21] And, one was history, one was English, and, and people go, oh, that's right. And I was like,
[00:12:26] no, no, I didn't do it. I didn't do it in your homework. Um, were they teaching in your school?
[00:12:32] No, they weren't. Was your dad teaching in your school? No, no, no, no, so that, yeah, I think that helped.
[00:12:36] I don't think I would have liked having my teachers, my parents, as my own teachers.
[00:12:40] But, they, they got you on the reading path. And I, it must be, it must be something born.
[00:12:45] Like, you just must have been more naturally curious than me. I was like throwing rocks at my friends.
[00:12:50] No, I did that as well.
[00:12:52] Yeah, I mean, I think I, I was definitely a bit of a rebel. And I got a lot of trouble as a kid.
[00:12:58] I think I was just naturally inclined to, to be curious about history, particularly in that.
[00:13:03] It was, it was reading about, you know, the ancient Greeks, Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Vikings.
[00:13:09] It was those sort of exciting, quite, you know, quite masculine, manly stories that,
[00:13:13] that really inspired me to sort of take an interest. And, and I did from a, from an early age.
[00:13:18] And of course, it's, it's those sort of things that you read and then develop.
[00:13:23] I mean, one of the first books that my dad read to me was, was a children's version of the Odyssey.
[00:13:28] And I thought, you know, one day I'd love to go off on a ship and explore the world.
[00:13:32] You know, I mean, hopefully not lose all my men in the process. But, you know,
[00:13:36] but yeah, I definitely thank those, those early years for my, what I'm doing now.
[00:13:44] So, the weird thing about, well, one of the big differences about England and America is the schooling
[00:13:48] system and kind of the way you test to get into certain levels and my wife's a Brit.
[00:13:53] So I have some idea of it. But you, so you went to what, what, what,
[00:13:58] pain's Lee is that right? Pain's Lee Catholic School? That's where you went to.
[00:14:01] Yeah. So it was a non-fee paying. It was just an ordinary state school.
[00:14:07] But it was, you know, as a Catholic school, the Catholic schools were,
[00:14:10] we're not sometimes, you know, considered better in, in some ways.
[00:14:15] You know, a real bent-ward science. That wasn't my bag at all. But good teachers. And, um,
[00:14:21] it was one of those schools that that you can, you can flourish in with, with the right attitude.
[00:14:26] But, but also you can get a lot of trouble if you don't have the right attitude. And I, I sort of
[00:14:30] do both. What, what, what sport were you playing? Um, so I wouldn't say I was hugely into sports.
[00:14:37] I, I preferred, I was into athletics. I was a good runner as a kid. But I wasn't,
[00:14:42] wasn't really know for its team sports. And that kind of frustrated me in, in some ways,
[00:14:46] because, you know, I knew that I was kind of, sold on the idea of the army from probably the age of about
[00:14:53] 11 or 12 in fact. So I knew that I should probably be doing rugby or something like that. But
[00:14:58] it wasn't really unauthor in my school. So I had to be creative with, with what I was doing. So I took
[00:15:03] did a lot of personal fitness, did a lot of running, like I said. Um, I was interested in boxing
[00:15:07] from the ongagging that that's something that I took up. And, and that followed me into my
[00:15:11] army career as well. So what age, you start boxing now? Um, I mean, I was training from probably
[00:15:16] 15, 16. Um, when I went to university at 18, I was in the university club. And then, like I said,
[00:15:22] did it throughout the army as well. So I know you, you went on like, uh, this is, I don't know if
[00:15:28] Americans do this or not. They go like traveling. Yeah. That's what you all call it, right? My wife did it.
[00:15:35] Oh, traveling, right? And so, and so you did that, too. Like, in America, you graduate high school,
[00:15:40] then if you're either going in the military or getting a job or you're, you're going, there's no
[00:15:44] traveling mode. There's no traveling thing. Echo did you go traveling? No, sir. No. We're not going
[00:15:50] traveling for a year, but it's real normal. Oh, yeah. And it's something that is now. You know, when I,
[00:15:55] when I left school, it was 18 in 2001, um, yeah, I knew that I wanted to join the army. And I was
[00:16:04] sort of, I really wanted to go to Sandhurst and go in as an officer and done. But because of my
[00:16:09] background, I wasn't, you know, one of these posh private schools, I hadn't, you know,
[00:16:12] necessarily got the sports background. So I knew I needed to do something that would give me a bit of
[00:16:16] an edge. And it was, it was a joke drinking an Australian. Yeah. That's exactly that. But it, it was
[00:16:22] actually a stroke of, unfortunately, not. So when I was a kid, I was, I was doing every odd job
[00:16:26] going. I worked in factories. I was in shops. I would even flip burgers up with Donald's just to try
[00:16:30] and get some cash together. I flip burgers at Wendy's. So we go. Yeah. It's got to be a
[00:16:35] kind of a building still making of great military leadership, flipping burgers, get some.
[00:16:40] So I was doing all of that to try and earn a bit of bit of cash before going to university.
[00:16:44] And one of the jobs I was doing was working as a theme park, um, the place called Altantowers.
[00:16:49] And I think, you know, I was basically, I must be on one of the rides upside down and I lost my wallet,
[00:16:54] fell out my pocket and I was a bit upset because I had my entire weeks earnings but about five pounds
[00:16:58] in. So it's quite surprise. A couple of days later when the wallet was returned in the post.
[00:17:03] And not only was the five pounds still in there, but there was also a note from the person who would
[00:17:08] found the wallet. And it was actually signed off. There was a note saying, don't be such a,
[00:17:13] you know, I won't say the word. If it's just an asshole for losing your wallet, keep, keep
[00:17:18] better, sort of carry your belongings. It was signed off by a certain lieutenant.
[00:17:23] Day in the odd in the Royal Artillery. And I thought, oh, that's a nice, nice guy. I was
[00:17:28] not everyone who would return a wallet. And so I, you know, I did the right thing and wrote a
[00:17:33] thank you letter back. I feel like I know what I said. You're lesson is cost new five.
[00:17:39] That's mine. So I said it, but it, because I was already interested in the career and they
[00:17:43] always said, if you got any hints or tips on how to get into Sandhurst. And by return of post
[00:17:48] came back a six page essay with all of these really great tips. It was like, you know, go and
[00:17:54] learn how to read a map and use a compass. This is how many press ups you need to do to pass the
[00:17:59] fitness test. All this really useful advice. But the last sentence is something I'll never
[00:18:05] forget. But it could said above all travel dot dot dot, because at the end of the day, you'll have
[00:18:10] some great stories in the bar and the mess. So I took that to heart. So I decided based on that letter,
[00:18:16] which was all the, this serenity of the results of me losing my wallet, that I was going to go
[00:18:20] when, do what we call an Englander gap year, which is exactly what you say, go drinking Australia.
[00:18:26] So my, my, I told my dad and he said, what on earth is a gap year? This wasn't particularly
[00:18:30] popular, you know, that time. And I said it, you know, it's going to go find myself on the beaches
[00:18:34] of Thailand. And he said, well, if you do that, you can go get yourself a bloody job. So that's
[00:18:39] what I had to go and start earning more cash. And, but eventually, I did, I went away backpacking.
[00:18:44] And at the age of 18, you know, to literally just disappear off the first place I went traveling
[00:18:48] was actually in South Africa. I was just pretty, pretty dodgy, you know, in that time,
[00:18:53] which is in Bobway, which, which at the age of 18, it was the first time I'd had a gun pulled on me
[00:18:58] by a taxi driver who tried to rob me. So it was all really quite, you know, sort of, it teaches you
[00:19:05] a lot about independence. So what do you learn about how to handle getting a gun pulled on you
[00:19:09] by the taxi driver? Well, you can't just throw that out there. I think we're just going to let it
[00:19:13] ride. So, so I've been in the, so you're in the bar, so it's in Bobway. I was traveling, I've met
[00:19:17] this random Dutch dude who was much older than me. I was 18, this guy must have been 2930.
[00:19:23] He was backpacking as well. And we were on the same route. And we got off the train as
[00:19:29] place called Bulloeway. And we sort of got into a taxi and asked the price to whatever the,
[00:19:36] the next bus station. And he said it was going to be $40, which is in Bobway, has dollars. So,
[00:19:41] $40 is equivalent of about $2 US dollars. And we like, yeah, and it brought me. So we put our
[00:19:45] bags in the trunk of the car off again. And it was like two minutes round of corner. We thought,
[00:19:49] okay, we got out and he said okay, $40. We got the Zimbabwe dollars out and he said, no, no,
[00:19:55] you rest dollars, 40 US dollars. And we thought he was joking. And laughed at him. He said, no, no,
[00:20:00] police handling is Jack, it pulls out a piston, said 40 US dollars. And we're like, oh, shit,
[00:20:05] okay, well, I don't have 40 US dollars. I'm going to budget about $2 a day. So we said,
[00:20:10] okay, we'll pay, but let's get our bags out. And it was quite a busy crowded sort of car park.
[00:20:14] So we got our bags out the boot and this guy's Dutch guy, who's called it, you know,
[00:20:20] called a hefty fella. He said, okay, come over here and the taxidol, I'll be put his pistol
[00:20:25] in the car, he got out. So he's on the arm at the time. And this guy just sort of, as he got
[00:20:29] his bag on his back just headbutted this taxi driver, right? And then looked at me and said,
[00:20:35] fucking run. So I ran and we escaped. But this guy then we jumped in another taxidol, drive.
[00:20:41] So, but the original guy was chasing us through the streets of, of,
[00:20:45] a bullet-away. So I had my first, not only my first sort of gunpulled on me, but my first car
[00:20:49] chase at the age of 18, which is all pretty wild. But it was those early travels that sort of
[00:20:55] encouraged me to sort of, yeah, be careful, be independent minded and start to think about
[00:21:00] looking after myself. What are the chances that you made it back
[00:21:03] through the first year of travels? Well, well, after that experience, it was all fairly
[00:21:08] tell you, I have to say, but you know, getting joined in Australia. But it was no, it was great.
[00:21:12] And it was probably that first year of travel really that motivated me to want to do more.
[00:21:17] Because, you know, I popped from that, that one sort of moment, it was usual backpacking stuff.
[00:21:22] But throughout my time at university, I went to more and more challenging and interesting places.
[00:21:28] I went to, in my second year at university, I was studying history. And my particular interest
[00:21:34] was the history of travel writing. So I looked at Marco Polo and his travels. I was reading about
[00:21:39] the Hippitraele of the 1960s, the great pilgrimages, all the big overland journeys. So I tried
[00:21:46] to make all my studies around that. So in my summer leave, I would try and go to the place that I've
[00:21:52] been studying around. So after one particular module, bear in mind, this was in 2001, just after
[00:21:58] none 11, had happened. So there's a real focus on the Middle East. And that was a place that I was
[00:22:02] fascinated by because of the history. But also what was going on in the news at the time.
[00:22:08] So me and a buddy decided on some of that we were going to go and travel around the Middle East.
[00:22:12] This was in 2003. So it was a second year at university. The Iraq war was happening.
[00:22:20] And we said, okay, we're going to go to Egypt and just have a look around that we're going to
[00:22:23] Israel. And then when we were in Israel, there was a bomb went off in Jerusalem, caused the borders
[00:22:29] to shut. So what we plan to do was take a boat from the coast, from high-fer to Greece, and then
[00:22:35] go back back into Europe. That was all now not on the cards. My parents thought, I thought,
[00:22:41] maybe I might make Alex, we're actually on holiday in Greece at the time. Anyway, so they had no
[00:22:44] idea where we actually were. The only board that was open was to the East to Jordan. So we went to
[00:22:49] Jordan. And then we were in Jordan, another bomb went off, which meant that we were stuck in Jordan.
[00:22:53] The only board of the end was open. It was actually further east, which was to Iraq. So we took
[00:22:58] a taxi from the capital of Jordan, a man all the way to Baghdad at a cost of $20. This was,
[00:23:03] I was 21 at the time, or 20. And I was met by a national guardman on the border who said,
[00:23:10] to have joined by a gun. He said you're going to need it. Wait, you're going to go. This is 2003.
[00:23:16] And we got to Baghdad because it was the only route that was open.
[00:23:19] And we went in 2003, August. So the war is it's on? It's on. Yeah, combat operations are just
[00:23:25] finished, more or less. But before the main insurgency had begun, but stuff was definitely exploding around
[00:23:33] us at the time. And what part of this idea sounded smart to you? Well, we didn't have another option.
[00:23:40] We couldn't afford to fly home from Israel because we had their money. And we thought it would
[00:23:44] just be a bit of an exciting adventure. And so we made it to Baghdad, but then we stayed in the hotel
[00:23:49] Palestine. Oh, I know where that is. That's freaking crazy. We couldn't afford a night there because
[00:23:57] it was 100 bucks, which is a lot of money when you were a student. And so we thought, okay,
[00:24:01] this was just after somebody had just shot the top of the hotel because they thought there's an
[00:24:05] Iraqi assert in Surgeon. It was actually a camera crew. So we thought if we can sneak up the fire
[00:24:10] escape up the ladders, then we can just sleep amongst the rubble on the roof. So we did that.
[00:24:14] We got into the roof and then there happened to be a UK, a British film crew filming a newspiece
[00:24:20] on the roof and they said, you know, what are you idiots doing here? And we explained that we
[00:24:24] are sort of backpacking through the middle east. And this guy's, I don't remember if we were
[00:24:28] to get his name Martin Geisler, who's an ITN correspondence, said, look, you must be the first
[00:24:33] tourist in Iraq. Tell you what, if we can do a newspiece about you, we'll pay for your room.
[00:24:38] So we ended up staying for a week because we couldn't get, we couldn't get out of Iraq at this point.
[00:24:42] And eventually we managed to escape by hitching a ride with some former SAS mercenary security
[00:24:49] guys who were doing the route up to Crete, which was before Saddam Hussein had been captured.
[00:24:53] So we actually had an intercrete before Saddam whilst he was still down his little hole.
[00:24:58] So eventually long story short, we got out to Turkey and then eventually did find it.
[00:25:02] Final way back to Europe. Major amount of survivor bias on this whole thing. So anyone that's
[00:25:07] listening, you have to overcome this survivor bias, I'm going to recommend not particularly following
[00:25:14] this extreme level of let's just go for it. What are you carrying in your backpack?
[00:25:22] It's little as possible, you know, a shemag just so we could kind of blend in. We had to go to the
[00:25:26] local market to buy you sort of traditional how many liters is your backpack? Just a day sack.
[00:25:32] So we were talking about 20, 20 liters. You've got a 25 liter backpack. Yeah, that's it. That's it.
[00:25:37] And we even put that, you know those sort of plastic big bags, this sort of check check ones that
[00:25:43] people go to the market in it. Okay. Just so we didn't stand out and we bought those shiny
[00:25:49] shirts and black shoes that they were in the middle east so that we, you know, I'm quite
[00:25:53] sort of fairly dark in. So we could blend in and it worked and we were just sort of walking on
[00:25:58] the markets of back down and you know, it was fine. Do not try this at home. Do not try this.
[00:26:05] I did some of my parents still about sexual pleasure. So then you finally, so then you finally get out.
[00:26:10] How do you get back? You just hitch a ride with some wind. We hitched a ride. Contractors? Yeah,
[00:26:14] ride it to the untouch border and then we'll hitch the way home to the UK. How long is it to hitchhike these
[00:26:20] days? I actually, I was hitch out last week actually in the States. And you got picked up pretty
[00:26:27] fast. Yeah, it's fine. It depends where you are. But I, you know, I used to love it because it was
[00:26:32] a great way of meeting interesting people. And in fact, when I, it's also a great way to get
[00:26:38] kidding. It can happen. It can happen. But I think what my trips at taught me was you got
[00:26:44] out of a bit of faith in human nature. You have way more faith than human nature than I do. I've
[00:26:48] done too many, these five guests to be jumping in vehicles with random people. It's weird too
[00:26:53] because when I was a kid and I don't know, I guess I'm 10 years old as a new, maybe,
[00:26:58] yeah, something around 10 or 12. But when I was a kid hitchhiking was very normal. Yeah.
[00:27:02] You'd see it all the time. People, you know, you go get on the highway. Yeah. I hitchhike and there's
[00:27:05] no big deal. If I miss the school bus, we hitchhike. Yeah. You go on things like that. Yeah.
[00:27:09] But nowadays people, people are more scared. It's way more scared. And I guess that's part of
[00:27:13] that is just there's more news is more prevalent. Well, like when someone gets kidnapped and freaking
[00:27:17] raped and murdered, you know about it. Whereas in 1978, it was just no factor. No. In your mind,
[00:27:25] that didn't happen to people. You trusted human nature. Yeah. Yeah. And all this is taking place
[00:27:31] while you're going to college. So you're the worst. You have nodding him. That's right. Yeah. So I
[00:27:34] stood in history every summer we'd go off and do some crazy adventure. But it all kind of
[00:27:40] built up really to when I graduated in the summer of 2004. So I still desperate joined the army
[00:27:47] but I'd got the travel bucket at the stage. So I wanted to sort of do something even bigger and better.
[00:27:53] And because I've been studying about these overland journeys, I decided I should really
[00:27:58] do a bit do a really big one. And so I thought I'd want to actually hitchhike
[00:28:04] all the way to India following the ancient Silk Road and following the footsteps of sort of
[00:28:07] market polo. So I did. I hitchhiked from, I put my thumb up at notting them service station
[00:28:13] and five months later somehow made it to go or in India. And that was a wild journey because
[00:28:20] it went through all of Europe through Russia and through the Caucasus. I was in Chechnya.
[00:28:26] I went through Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan over the, you know, over the Kiber Pass and then
[00:28:34] and all of that, you know, I was fascinated by the stories of Victorian exploration,
[00:28:39] great game, particularly in Central Asia. Afghanistan was very much on my radar then because
[00:28:46] the Brachomia just sort of made deployments in Kabul. It hadn't, things hadn't really
[00:28:50] kicked off in the south yet at the stage but so it was probably a fairly, you know, safe as it gets
[00:28:55] an Afghanistan to go traveling there. But that was a journey I really really wanted to do and
[00:29:01] and so yeah, if I went and again very similar thing, I just went with a small day sack.
[00:29:07] I had no money, I had total of 500 pounds in my bank account. There was the all those left
[00:29:13] from my student loan and I thought I'll see how far I can get and it took five months. So I was
[00:29:18] just, you were eating? Well, a lot of 500 pounds feeds me for like a day and a half. It does,
[00:29:23] it does mean now. But the hell are you eating? So not very much, I was pretty skinny.
[00:29:29] So yeah, I was, I was just, I kind of, maybe I was a bit reckless but I was just really
[00:29:34] pulling my faith in human nature. So I hitchhiked the whole way. Usually whoever I was hitchhiking
[00:29:42] with, you know, I was 21 right. So people look, and when you tell them what you're doing,
[00:29:47] they think you're either mad or they feel sorry for you. And off the back of that, I got
[00:29:51] invicing to people's homes, you know, I met lots of girls that were here. But people look after you
[00:29:57] and often they would stuff $10 into your pocket on the way out or fill your bag with apples or
[00:30:02] whatever it might be. So I think actually came about with more than I started with. Okay, so I'm
[00:30:06] starting to think, I'm starting to feel like maybe things are different in life for you and me.
[00:30:13] I'm just saying, maybe you're a sweet looking guy and I'm not. The last time somebody tried to
[00:30:18] slip me $10 was never. You think I get invited into people's homes? That doesn't happen.
[00:30:25] So you're, you're living a charm to life. I'm over here. I feel like the world might have
[00:30:29] been against me this whole time. If I put my thumb out as you did, there's no one's going to pick
[00:30:36] me up. Zero. The percentage of people that picked me up is zero.
[00:30:40] Yeah, I wouldn't happen these days for me. I don't think. I think it's definitely a thing
[00:30:44] when you're younger. It's it's formal like it. To happen. I don't think I would. How many pairs of pants
[00:30:49] are you bringing with you? I went fully light scales. I like to use brand the pants of your wife.
[00:30:54] I had one pair of pants, a couple of shirts. That's it, really. It was great. The freedom,
[00:31:02] the liberation of it all. It was brilliant. I was just sleeping at the side of the road. I had
[00:31:07] one poncho. Sorry, I had a bivvy bag. I had a ground pad. I didn't even have a ground pad.
[00:31:13] I was just, if somebody didn't invite me into that home, I would just sleep on it. I mean,
[00:31:19] in Russia, I remember sleeping in the middle of this roundabout because it was a busy city.
[00:31:23] There was nowhere to stay. I couldn't speak a word of the language. I just found this roundabout.
[00:31:27] It was a really gray industrial area. It was quite cold. It was a roundabout. I saw some
[00:31:35] top-end plastic sheeting as a perfect. This was going to keep me dry because it was about to rain.
[00:31:41] Gunned this top-end. I heard some rustling. I thought I should have shittled some rats in there.
[00:31:46] I looked underneath. There was actually two other homeless people sleeping under this
[00:31:51] bag. It had to move from there. It was sort of experiences like that. I looked back and
[00:31:57] think, what I thought was like doing. At the time, it felt like it was a big ground adventure.
[00:32:04] Again, what did you eat? Whatever I can get my hands on. I was usually one meal a day.
[00:32:10] I tried to budget it so I had three dollars or whatever per day to spend on food. In a ran, I remember
[00:32:17] I ran out of money in a ran. I think I had five dollars left. I knew I needed to pay for a visa
[00:32:27] at the Afghan border. Not only had I had my money in a ran, but I was going into Afghanistan completely
[00:32:33] penniless. I had it like one traveler's check, but you can't change any sort of Western traveler's
[00:32:38] checks in a ran because there was a big embargo on all that stuff. I remember staying. I went to
[00:32:45] this small hotel in the middle of the desert and explained to this. The Iranians of lovely people,
[00:32:51] and they're very, very hospitable. Everyone else had looked after me, but in this particular place,
[00:32:55] there was more than the Russians that had let you sleep in the free place. What are our
[00:32:59] damn? That restored my faith in Russians because I'm like the Russians didn't help you. Come on.
[00:33:03] No, they did. Honestly, I was like, it was tough for a Russian than a lot of places.
[00:33:07] Thank you. It was definitely, you know, going across the border into Georgia was great because
[00:33:14] there was a start difference there. So you're rolling to wear it in Iran? Well, I mean, a place
[00:33:20] called Mashad, which is a big holy city on the near the Afghan border, nowhere to stay. And I found
[00:33:25] this one hotel, like a motel thing, and I explained to this guy, said, look, can I have a room? I've got
[00:33:31] five dollars, but I really need three dollars to get the Afghan stamp because it was that so much
[00:33:34] of gossip. He said, look, you can stay for free on my office floor and I said, if you got any food,
[00:33:39] he said, no, there's no food, but I noticed there was a wedding sort of party happening. He said,
[00:33:43] just going to help yourself to the leftovers. So score. You know, there's always a way, there's always
[00:33:48] a way. But yeah, I ended up in Afghanistan, literally, no money. But I knew I'd been told that the
[00:33:54] Afghans are pretty hospitable. And they were, I mean, it's to sort of hitchhike across the whole country
[00:33:59] through her rat. I went through the central mountains through Chadsharan, Bamiyan, and an end up in
[00:34:05] Kabul. How are you as a kind, being able to cash that traveler's check? How are you overcome
[00:34:09] in the language barrier? By hand signals. I mean, I had a pretty good bid at that stage. So
[00:34:17] the places that I was traveling to were ethnically tragic because I was, I'd got a pretty good
[00:34:21] town of the beard. Everyone thought I was a pastor and so they all, they all sort of kept the distance
[00:34:24] because they thought it was a Taliban. But as a result, they were quite, you know, they kind of looked
[00:34:29] after me and, yeah, it was fine. And then where did that trip end? That ended in India. So maybe
[00:34:37] it through Afghanistan, always be Pakistan and then finally made it to the beach and go where I
[00:34:42] sort of shaved the beard off and finally had a beard and celebrated still being alive.
[00:34:50] Once again, I'm over here, look, I got four kids. And my opinion is don't try this at home.
[00:34:56] I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you're telling me about it. I'm not encouraged you people to
[00:35:00] necessarily be the same. No, actually you wrote an entire book telling people to do this stuff. So
[00:35:06] I'm going to disagree with you. It comes with a disclaimer. All right, speaking the book,
[00:35:12] I'm going to go back to the book here for a second because at some point,
[00:35:19] well, before I jump into that, you, you, you, you get into Sanhurst. So what's the deal with Sanhurst?
[00:35:25] Sanhurst is not like West Point where you go there and you go to college for four years.
[00:35:29] No, Sanhurst is 12 months pretty much. That's 44 weeks. Spread over here.
[00:35:35] You, it tends to be mainly graduates, so people who've finished university,
[00:35:40] but there is, you know, it is open to people who haven't necessarily been to university.
[00:35:45] And you spend 12 months or then you commission into whichever regiments or call that you,
[00:35:50] that you choose to join. And how hard is it to get in the Sanhurst?
[00:35:54] Tough. Yeah, very tough. I started my application process. I think I was 17 when I went
[00:35:59] into the career's office with my dad. You then do the, what was then known as the Regimental,
[00:36:06] sorry, the RCB. Basically, the selection in Sanhurst, so you have to go to a place called West
[00:36:12] Bre where you do all these sort of command tasks, lots of interviews, mental arithmetic,
[00:36:18] all this sort of stuff where you're tested for your aptitude and your personality. A lot of
[00:36:22] it's about leadership, but showing that not necessarily having experience in leadership, but the
[00:36:27] potential to develop your leadership. Is there any other ways to get your commission
[00:36:32] besides going like in America, you can go to West Point or the Naval Academy or whatever,
[00:36:37] or you can go to ROTC, which is you go to college while you're taking classes about whatever
[00:36:42] branch you're going into, or you can do Officer Canada School. So there's, or you can be a
[00:36:47] prior and listed guy. Yep. And you can get commissioned. How does it work in England? So all offices
[00:36:52] have to go to Sanhurst. Even if you'd done O's, I was an O's, you see whilst at university, so I did
[00:36:56] three years there. Is it a different school for that army versus the Navy? Yes, so this three,
[00:37:01] so Sanhurst is for the Army, then you've got one down at Portsmouth Fort for the Navy,
[00:37:06] and then you've got Crown World, which is for the Royal Air Force. Yeah. But you're gonna go,
[00:37:12] if you're gonna get a commission, that's what you're doing. I want, yeah exactly, you've got to go
[00:37:15] Sanhurst. And so for me, it was quite, I'd heard about it, my dad had encouraged me, he didn't
[00:37:20] get into Sanhurst. He wanted to join his as a reservist back in the 70s, didn't work out for him.
[00:37:28] So I felt like I was, and my grandfather was, you know, he was an elicited private soldier,
[00:37:32] so there was no history of officership within my family, although I think there were five
[00:37:37] generations of soldiers previously, so we'd all served him one way or another. So to go to Sanhurst
[00:37:43] was a real privilege, but also a big challenge, because there was, it was quite a daunting prospect,
[00:37:48] you know, I was from a pretty normal background, and then suddenly I was in the same
[00:37:50] platoon as Prince Harry. So I was, you know, surrounded by a totally different type of people
[00:37:56] that I hadn't necessarily met before. Lots of people who'd been big in sports who'd gone to
[00:38:02] a very prestigious universities, but I could say it's about leadership and demonstrating the
[00:38:08] potential to be an officer. Now let's jump into the book.
[00:38:13] Um, I passed the Army's commissioning board, which meant I could join his officer and command
[00:38:20] men, something I found both exciting and daunting. A young officer's training takes place at the
[00:38:26] Royal Military Academy Sanhurst, and when I arrived there age 23, I still wasn't sure where I
[00:38:31] wanted to end up. After visiting as many units as they want to see where they might fit in,
[00:38:38] officer cadets can select two regiments to have interviews within their final term. So before you
[00:38:46] go to Sanhurst, you go and meet with various units to see which ones you like. Yeah, you do think
[00:38:51] cool is that? You do these sort of familiarization visits, and they can be as formal or informal as
[00:38:56] the regiment chooses. So, you know, a lot of the cavalry units, which are known to attract quite
[00:39:01] posh well to do officers, they just go on a drinking bench for a weekend. Over units, you know,
[00:39:06] the engineers or the artillery do slightly more, you know, craft-focused exercises. The
[00:39:12] powers I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't look into the powers at this stage. So I, I got to visit my
[00:39:17] local unit, the Stafford's, I looked at the Gurkers, and I went to look at the intelligence
[00:39:21] course. So you go, you basically go and have a look around, see if it's the right fit for you,
[00:39:26] and it's a two-way thing they might not like you, and so you don't come back.
[00:39:31] So now you show up at Sanhurst, back to the book Sanhurst was hard work, and the late nights,
[00:39:36] ironing my uniforms, the parades, and long-accadeping assay, academic assays were only part of it.
[00:39:41] There was a lot of running marching and being shouted at along with field exercises,
[00:39:45] rifle ranges, and blowing things up as well as learning the more subtle arts of our officership,
[00:39:50] fancy dinners, the intricacies of letter writing, and knowing the debrets guide to etiquette inside
[00:39:56] and out. It was an interesting and varied education, the debrets guide to etiquette.
[00:40:02] Yeah, I, I didn't know, this wasn't, I don't know what it is right now.
[00:40:06] So it's basically a manual of how to behave like a proper gentleman.
[00:40:11] Give us one example. Well, it's, you know, it's, I mean, the basics of, you know,
[00:40:15] if you're going to a seven-course meal, it's like which, which knife and fork do you start with first?
[00:40:20] Yeah. It's how to write, you know, if you're writing a letter to a member of the Royal Family,
[00:40:25] how do you address them? So when I, I would to officer candidate school, and this is only
[00:40:30] 13 weeks long. So you, but you do get etiquette training. I believe the only thing I remember,
[00:40:36] this is a weird thing to remember. Echo Charles take notes. This could be important.
[00:40:40] Because I, it surprised me. If you get a piece of food in your mouth that you didn't want in there,
[00:40:46] the proper way to get it out of your mouth is to put it back on the fork and put it down.
[00:40:52] So in other words, if you, if you're eating a piece of chicken and there's a bone in there,
[00:40:56] you don't pull it out with your, with your hand. You, you put it back on the fork and you put it down.
[00:41:03] Now I think it's a lot more subtle to, you know, put the hand up. My face grab that thing.
[00:41:08] I'm like, no, I'm never going to know what I just did. As opposed to spitting the food back on the fork.
[00:41:12] Right? That's kind of, yeah. But hey, that's the tradition. That, that the rules.
[00:41:16] But that, so in regards to that, what if, so it has to be something like a bone, like,
[00:41:24] hey, I, I'm a piece of gristle, you're eating this steak and there's a piece of gristle that ain't going down.
[00:41:29] Yeah. What are we going to do? Put the fork back next to your mouth. This is a legit look.
[00:41:33] I'm not, I'm not even following this protocol. Because I think that's a lot nastier.
[00:41:37] I'll clan destine move. You won't know what happened. But that gristle is coming into my hand.
[00:41:42] It's going to be somewhere on the ground. Make sense. But what if,
[00:41:46] and this might go outside of the scope of even what you're talking about, what if you eat some chicken,
[00:41:50] that's like dry or like, well, you know, some new food like an S-car go or something like this.
[00:41:55] And you're like, oh, first time. Did you start liking it? I don't like this at all. Do you spit the whole
[00:41:59] S-car go on the fork? Or we have to go. Well, I have to consult the Nebraska.
[00:42:05] Oh, you said that's a good bread guide for, I don't know what to do. I think you're in a tough spot.
[00:42:09] Yeah. I had that happen. I was, I don't like seafood. And I was with, I was in
[00:42:14] Sierra Leone. And I was, there was stuff going on down there. And I was with my commanding officer.
[00:42:24] And there was like I said, there were things going on. We were trying to figure things out.
[00:42:28] So we get invited. And I was like, it's a little sidekick guy. I was a priori and
[00:42:32] listen guy. But I was, had been commissioned as an officer. And he was just
[00:42:36] really taken care of me and showed me the ropes. And so he gets invited to go see the
[00:42:41] charge da fairs, which is the number two underneath the ambassador in the country. Unless there's
[00:42:47] no ambassador in which case they're, they're the, the bleed. And in this particular case, there was no
[00:42:51] ambassador. So this individual was the lead. So we roll up. And this isn't Sierra Leone. There's a
[00:42:56] freaking war going on there. The Ekomog versus all that craziness is happening in Liberia. It's just,
[00:43:02] it just mayhem down in Africa. So we roll up to this like really nice house and every there's
[00:43:08] servants in the whole nine yards. And the first thing they put in front of me is some kind of crazy
[00:43:13] like, just like, like, you mean like, no, it's like octopus shrimp and like raw fish all in one thing.
[00:43:22] Yeah. And I'm trying to do what I remembered from, you know, adequate, which is you eat whatever,
[00:43:28] you know, they're putting something front of you. They went the distance. And so on, I was just,
[00:43:32] I sucked it up, bro. I did it for the good of the mission for the good of the YouTube. All right.
[00:43:40] Little detour there back to the book. I also took a boxing. Everyone had to be part of a sports club
[00:43:45] at Sanhurst. And I wasn't into rugby or rowing boxing seemed like a decent choice.
[00:43:49] Initially, I hated the 430 AM starts. But as fitness started to, as the fitness started to impact on me
[00:43:56] and I felt myself improving. I came to relish the early morning alarm calls. Plus there was the
[00:44:01] added carrot of the annual fight night in which the most dedicated committed boxers were chosen
[00:44:06] to fight, watched by the whole academy as well as the string of generals, politicians, and VIP guests.
[00:44:13] I was incredibly proud to be chosen as one of those fighters. And on 9 November 2005, I stood in the
[00:44:18] ring surrounded by over 1,000 people face to face with officer candidate, Mortimer.
[00:44:25] I won the fight by knocking my opponent to the ground, but I'm not retelling the story to discuss
[00:44:30] the win. I had a huge respect for my opponent and the opportunity that came next to a road simply
[00:44:35] from having stood in the arena. After the fight, all the boxers were invited to the sergeant's
[00:44:41] mess. A club of sorts, where many of our training instructors lived. This was a huge honor because
[00:44:47] it was because this particular mess was usually out of bounds and the sergeants themselves were
[00:44:51] only seen in their context as authoritarian figures, all muscles, tattoos, and shaved heads.
[00:44:58] The fact that we privilege few were allowed into their private domain was viewed with absolute
[00:45:02] envy by the other cadets. The sergeants crowded round the fighters and congratulated us all
[00:45:08] on our performance, victors and defeated alike. As I finished my second pint of beer, I found another
[00:45:14] one thrust into my hand. Looking up, I saw it was capped and true it. The sandhurt representative
[00:45:20] of the parachute regiment. Congratulations, Wood, which regiment are you joining? He said,
[00:45:26] sternly, I hesitated momentarily before applying. I'm not sure sir. I was looking at the staffers
[00:45:32] or the int corp. So until. Saw that, he said, you should join the Paris. My look of surprise must have
[00:45:39] been quite apparent. The Paris were the most fearsome soldiers in the British Army. I'm not good enough
[00:45:45] to get in the Paris, I thought you needed to be a muscle bound machine to get in. It wasn't even
[00:45:50] all my radar. Sit down the captain barked. I sat on one of the little stools by the bar,
[00:45:54] beer still in hand. First two rounds of interviews have already been done. He told me,
[00:45:58] we had over a hundred applicants and now we're down to 20. I don't do this very often and I won't
[00:46:03] ask you twice, but do you want to interview? I sobered up pretty quickly. My entire future
[00:46:08] rested in the balance and all sorts of thoughts crossed my mind. What about the staffers? They
[00:46:14] seem like a nice enough bunch and the intelligence corp. They did some interesting, spy-related work.
[00:46:18] It could be a good start to my career, which would allow me to travel too. When it came to the
[00:46:22] Paris, there were a lot of unknowns. As a regiment, they are shrouded in mystery and are considered
[00:46:27] to be one of the countries if not the world's most elite military units. I didn't know what to
[00:46:31] expect and I didn't think I was capable of joining their ranks. The temptation was to play it safe
[00:46:36] and stick with a more achievable goal. I knew what I was getting into with the staffers.
[00:46:43] If I agreed to an interview with the Paris, I would automatically have to turn down one of the
[00:46:47] other options since you can only interview with two regiments and the Paris had the toughest selection
[00:46:52] of all just peaking the intelligence corp. If I turned down the staffers and failed the board
[00:46:58] for the others, I ran the risk of not getting any of my choices. I could end up being a blanket
[00:47:03] stacker in logistics corp for the rest of my career. The captain was staring at me.
[00:47:09] I'd like to interview Sir. I told him expecting that it would take place in the coming weeks.
[00:47:14] Nope. Captain Truitt launched into a formal interview right there at the bar,
[00:47:18] grilling me about my own motivations experiences, education and skills. On other 15 after another
[00:47:24] 15 minutes he stood up, shook my hand and told me to report to his office at 6 a.m. the next morning.
[00:47:29] And that's what I did hang over in all. I was fast tracked to the final eight and then at the
[00:47:35] last interview with a panel headed by some of the most senior figures in the British Army.
[00:47:39] I was offered a place in the Parisian Regiment. That's how I got into the Paris.
[00:47:52] Yeah. I mean, in hindsight it's those little moments isn't it?
[00:47:56] That can change your entire the course of your life and it was that drunken moment in a bar
[00:48:02] that boxing is what got me in and that's probably if I hadn't had joined the Paris,
[00:48:07] there's no way I would have been able to do half the stuff I've done since then.
[00:48:11] Let alone have the confidence to go and spend ten years exploring the world.
[00:48:16] So I'm glad I took it up and I'm glad I took the risk.
[00:48:21] And you made that decision and split you literally hadn't thought about the Paris at all.
[00:48:25] I haven't even been on my radar.
[00:48:28] And you fought maybe you weren't quite capable of doing it. Is that what kept it off your radar?
[00:48:34] I think until that point, I mentioned there the Staffordshire Regiment which was my local
[00:48:40] regiment and the intelligence corps which was very difficult to get into more from an intellectual
[00:48:46] capability. So I felt that in having the the ink corps that was going to that was quite a big
[00:48:52] risk. The Staffordshire was slightly more guaranteed in many respects. So the Paris, you know,
[00:48:57] like I say, I'm not the sort of biggest muscle bound guy in the world and looking around
[00:49:02] at some of the other guys that had been in the Paris, there's quite a there's quite an aggressive
[00:49:06] mentality to get in there and and like I said, there was a hundred applicants for only six
[00:49:11] places in the end. So no, it hadn't been on my radar but I think the boxing which had encouraged
[00:49:17] me to just have a bit more confidence is what did it for me. So at that and then the the
[00:49:22] probably the drinks I'd have for the in the bar at the time. If you were to say no, he'd
[00:49:27] hand it to another shot. Probably. Do you keep in touch with this guy? Yeah. He's got freaking
[00:49:32] change your life. He did. Yeah. He actually he sent me a message on LinkedIn the other day which
[00:49:36] is quite a coincidence because it's not heard from him for for quite a number of years and I
[00:49:40] mentioned that he was going to go in my book and he said, why? I said, well, actually so you
[00:49:44] were it was you that I can thank for all of all of what's happened. And then what about the guy
[00:49:49] that found your wallet? Naces guy ever. I've tried to track him down. I can't find him anyway.
[00:49:53] One day I'll send him a nice letter back. Yeah, it's just a good reminder to people to
[00:49:59] everybody. You know, you have the opportunity to like completely change people's lives and
[00:50:04] and just by doing something cool and nice and freaking those those guys. I mean, first of all,
[00:50:10] giving you your wallet back and your money, that's kind of crazy. But then just giving you all
[00:50:16] a six-page essay on how to move forward and and you know what's look not everyone's going to
[00:50:21] take you up on your advice, right? And you give people advice all the time and you might get sick of
[00:50:26] doing it and you think, well, it's not worth it. But you change one person's life and you're a
[00:50:30] perfect example of that of your world changing because these momentary decisions and momentary
[00:50:40] mentorship from people. It's unbelievable. It's awesome. I mean, let's get to the pair as a little bit,
[00:50:46] going back to the book to join the parachute regimen candidates must undergo a tough selection
[00:50:50] process called pre-paracute selection run by Pegasus company, which is usually referred to as
[00:50:57] Pico. Pico company. Yeah. Based at the Infantry Training Center in Cadric, North Yorkshire,
[00:51:05] after 21 weeks of training candidates are put through a test to design, to test the resilience and
[00:51:11] determination, including a 20 mile endurance, March, late in with a 16 kilogram pack and a rifle in
[00:51:18] under four hours and 10 minutes and intimidating assault course, which is what you guys call
[00:51:23] obstacle courses. How many of you do call them assault courses, too? Let's go with the Salt Sounds
[00:51:28] Way, Coulok. 17 meters above the ground called the train azium. And 60 seconds of milling.
[00:51:38] Milling arguably the flagship event of parachute selection is a boxing match between candidates
[00:51:44] of similar size and strength in which determination and aggression are awarded and dodging and blocking
[00:51:50] lose points. In short, it amounts to being punched hard in the head for a minute straight while
[00:51:57] trying to hit the other guy as much and as hard as possible. If either combatting sheds blood or
[00:52:02] knocked to the floor, the clock is paused, blood wiped off and about resumes. It is forbidden to aim at
[00:52:08] any part of the opponent's body besides the head and the winner is the most aggressive candidate.
[00:52:16] Milling is designed specifically to replicate, quote, the conditions of stress and personal
[00:52:22] qualities required in a combat situation and test quote determination and raw fighting spirit
[00:52:30] of the candidates. It is this raw spirit of controlled aggression that sets pairs apart from the
[00:52:35] rest of the army. Good times. Yeah. How do you go to YouTube on that?
[00:52:41] I just want to see Milling. It's pretty cool. It's freaking legit. It's freaking legit.
[00:52:46] Just go as hard as you can. It's such a huge audience. You're on a delta-rated aggression punching
[00:52:51] straight to the head. You can't back off. You can't turn away. If you turn away, that's you.
[00:52:55] If you screw you in tight career, it's all based on that worm movement, especially as an officer.
[00:52:59] If you show any weakness, if you if you cow her away, you won't get in the
[00:53:04] regiment. So you can have spent months doing all the other training. You can have passed all the
[00:53:08] interviews, done the test. I know guys that spent six months who were perfectly capable of doing
[00:53:13] everything else and then they were just a bit weak on the milling. That was them done.
[00:53:16] Do they actually fail? Yeah. And you're not in. And then you're not in. Then you'll get sent some
[00:53:20] more else. Did you have to like rearrange your brain from your boxing training to not
[00:53:28] you know, peri and slets very different. Yeah. Because I would think your instinct would be you'd be
[00:53:34] slipping and moving and head movement and everything that you've learned to be a good
[00:53:38] boxer. You have to throw out the win. And there's no training for milling. The only event that you do,
[00:53:43] you don't practice this at all. The first time most of the blocks actually mill is on their tests.
[00:53:48] So you're you're giving your gloves and you're told the rules and you just go ahead.
[00:53:54] I mean it's a great spectator's ball. Yeah, this is definitely a busy behavior for sure.
[00:53:58] It's everything like that the UFC wants. Right? Just punch each other as much as you possibly
[00:54:04] freaking hand. How often do you guys get knocked out? A lot. Yeah. Like it's every other one.
[00:54:10] This guy's going down. I mean it's it's pretty full on. I mean, especially the officers.
[00:54:13] Because you're in with the the enlisted guys as well. So there's probably, they're saying
[00:54:18] 90 enlisted guys and like I say six officers and they always with the officers. I mentioned in
[00:54:23] there that you're usually put up against the person of your own size and weight. Officers,
[00:54:27] that's not true. They put you up against the biggest guy out there. So I was up against this
[00:54:32] this huge guy and it's all you take your top soft. It's all done. You know, so you can really
[00:54:37] get the full the full experience. And I was up against this huge guy and I was absolutely terrified.
[00:54:44] Probably because I'd already had my boxing match show, you know, it's handhurt and which I'd
[00:54:48] once I was quite proud of myself undefeated one. One would win. And then to go milling where you're surrounded
[00:54:54] by not only your future brother officers, but also, you know, dozens of men that you will go on
[00:55:01] to command. They're all watching you. All their eyes are on you. So you know, you've got to put
[00:55:06] on a bit of an act, a brave face of course, but you don't want to lose. And thankfully I did win.
[00:55:12] And it was only afterwards. I mean, I was I got a lucky punch and not to be guy out, but it was only
[00:55:16] it was only afterwards that he came up to me. He'd much told me much bigger than me and he was
[00:55:21] like good fight. So he said, I'll be honest. I was terrified of sight. He's serious. Like I'm literally
[00:55:25] half your sight. He said, you were the same person. But, G-C, well, no, he just said, you're a parachute
[00:55:30] region officer. I was never going to win against that. And I think that it's the mindset
[00:55:34] is an mentality. And so he was bizarrely, it was nothing to do with physical presence. It was
[00:55:39] far more against, you know, it's just that what's going on in your mind. And for him, it was to
[00:55:43] be up against an officer was was was a big thing. Damn, they played that game in the seal. So
[00:55:50] you give the young e-dogs, it's shot at the title and gets off through that officer better. Hey,
[00:55:55] no, I was just going to bring it. The other cool thing is I was watching the videos. It's like
[00:56:01] basically the ring is formed from the crowd. Yeah. And it's small. What is it? It's probably looks like
[00:56:05] like you don't move it. You don't move your feet. You don't move your feet. You're just
[00:56:08] stay still. I got a good dive. How much did you wear at the? I was probably 80, 75 kilo, 80
[00:56:18] kilograms. Yeah. What are you challenging it? I'll leave now.
[00:56:25] Really. Going back to the book, nothing worth having comes easy. And we will need to work hard
[00:56:34] to achieve things that we want most out of life. Whether this is learning a new skill or advancement
[00:56:38] in our professional careers, we need to be prepared to stay the course and keep working to our
[00:56:42] goals. No matter which obstacles appear along the way, when I was on my way into the parachute
[00:56:46] regimen, I busped up to cataract for my pre parachute selection. At that point, I had no idea
[00:56:52] what the next 20 or so weeks would look like for me. All I knew was that they would be the most
[00:56:57] stressful demanding challenging of my life so far. But I had a goal in mind. I was determined to
[00:57:02] earn that purple buret at the end. The recognition of my achievement and my initiation into one of
[00:57:09] the world's elite fighting regiments. That level of drive is absolutely crucial. We can't give our
[00:57:15] all to anything if we're not motivated by the end result. And if we're not giving our all,
[00:57:21] we've no chance of sticking things through when the going gets tough. Over the first few weeks of
[00:57:25] selection, it was pretty clear that a lot of people didn't have what it took. Some couldn't handle
[00:57:30] the rigors of training and fell behind. Others decided that enough was enough and dropped out of
[00:57:34] their own accord midway through. I had my own moment. When I fought my time on selection was up.
[00:57:40] I came down with a shin injury that sent me back behind the rest of my cohort for a few days.
[00:57:46] I'm able to join in the rigorous drills and knowing that when I was back in action, things would
[00:57:50] be exponentially tougher for the time I'd missed. I'd wondered if this was worth it.
[00:57:56] I started thinking about what my life would be like if I failed selection. Probably not all that
[00:58:01] bad. I could probably go and reapply to one of the armies other more sedate regiments than what.
[00:58:08] Have a fairly average military career. Perhaps go on some go to some interesting places and do
[00:58:12] some interesting things. But nothing grabbed me about it. Even more so when I considered a life
[00:58:19] and career outside the army, having just passed out of sandhurst, I couldn't for a moment contemplate
[00:58:24] the prospect of a civilian life. All I wanted was that maroon beret. They kept appearing in front
[00:58:30] of me every time I closed my eyes in a way it would have taken some motivation to present myself to
[00:58:35] one of the officer's running selection and tell them that I wanted to drop out that I couldn't do it.
[00:58:40] But I had no desire to do anything besides recover, get back to training and persevere through
[00:58:45] the rest of selection. So that's what I did. I pushed myself harder than I'd previously thought
[00:58:49] possible. Quickly making up the ground, I'd lost on the rest of the cadets. I remember my
[00:58:55] fear of heights being pushed to the background when I tackled the transenium. My 60 seconds of
[00:59:02] milling past and such a blur, I can't remember them all. Besides an overwhelming need not to hurt
[00:59:08] the person I was paired with, but to prove to him and everyone looking on that I wasn't one
[00:59:13] for backing down whatever the circumstances. Perhaps I'm fortunate that I was born with this
[00:59:17] amount of grit and determination. It's not always a positive. I've been told many times that I'm
[00:59:23] a stuttered as a mule, but up there in the cold, wet, windy, cataract, these inner reserves of
[00:59:29] drive, vision, grit and resilience pulled me through and I got the beret I've been dreaming about.
[00:59:35] It's hard to think how different my life would have been without it.
[00:59:42] One of the reasons I wanted to read that little section was
[00:59:45] there's a point where you're doing a little bit of rationalization. Like, oh, you know,
[00:59:50] if I don't make it, you know, like, well, probably might not be that bad, you know, and I
[00:59:54] not to put up with this. I hear people rationalizing stuff all day long. It's matter of fact,
[00:59:59] there's a TV show echo truss. It's called lost and they basically take these people out
[01:00:05] in the middle of nowhere and buy yourself. I think it's called lost. No, it's called alone. Sorry,
[01:00:08] it's called alone. They go out and they put these people. My little daughter who's 10 at the time,
[01:00:14] she got really into it and we would watch it. And so you can quit at any time. You can
[01:00:19] keep your radio and send out a transponder and they come and get you. But you'd be listening to the
[01:00:25] people and you'd hear them start to rationalize. You know? And so I taught my daughter. I said,
[01:00:31] you know what they're doing right? They should be able to breath. Oh, he's rationalizing.
[01:00:34] You know, because you know, the guys just know it's a, you know, I like being out here and I love
[01:00:38] the nature, but you know, I really miss my family. You know, I realize that my family's more and I
[01:00:42] look at my little daughter go, what's he doing right now? Rationalizing. He's about to quit.
[01:00:47] So I like the fact that you started going down a little bit down that path of rationalization.
[01:00:52] And then you said, you know what? No. Doesn't work. I think, you know, we're all to the
[01:00:57] prone to it to to varying degrees. And when when things get really tough, you know, they're
[01:01:05] elements of doubt do have a tendency to creep in and you just have to fight them. You have to sort of
[01:01:09] try and look at your situation objectively and realize what you're doing. And that rationalization
[01:01:16] thankfully is is is is outrightly sort of castigated in the parachute regiment. And you're
[01:01:23] reminded stop rationalizing. And the instructors, it might sound like they're shouting at you,
[01:01:27] but what they're doing is just reminding you not to give up. So thankfully it's stamped out
[01:01:32] pretty quickly, but a lot of it's on your own shoulders. You know, nobody wants you to quit. You know,
[01:01:35] the, the unit needs officers that need soldiers. They don't want people to leave. They're not
[01:01:39] telling you to quit. They're telling you to not quit. But so it's down to you.
[01:01:44] And people do this with every freaking thing in everyday life all day long. Like that last rep
[01:01:51] or that donut that you're like, you know, I did work out. I did work out hard. And it's actually
[01:01:57] it's really good to board yourself. It's good to have a positive feedback. But I did work out hard
[01:02:03] yesterday. And yeah, I want to be said, I don't want to be in a grind all the time. You got to enjoy life.
[01:02:08] Yeah, right. Displaying, because freedom, how about the freedom part? Here's the freedom part.
[01:02:11] Leave it down. You can rationalize anything. You can literally rationalize anything. If you're
[01:02:16] if you're not freaking careful, you will rationalize stuff that's not good for you. So you, you get
[01:02:23] done with this train. Is the milling like the last final thing to close to the end? It's close to the end.
[01:02:28] I think, but the most important event of all is something called the log race. And basically,
[01:02:33] there's a big telegraph pole. I can't remember how much it weighs, but it's bloody heavy. And
[01:02:38] there's like eight, eight people on each log. And usually one or two officers on each log. And
[01:02:43] it's a race. So you've got four logs or however many. How many days is it, too? No, it's just
[01:02:48] it's one event. I think it's the second to last day or the final day. And it's basically you are.
[01:02:54] You'll set off. It's about, I think it's three miles or something like that. And it's a race between
[01:02:59] the different groups. But you've got to stay on the log. If you come off the logs and officer,
[01:03:02] that will stay with you for the rest of your career. I know generals who are in the 17
[01:03:08] is still reminded by their fellow officers that they came off the log in 1975. It happened. So
[01:03:14] you're made aware of this. So you used to, a couple of officers did come off the log. I stayed on it.
[01:03:19] There was only two people left on the log and this thing is bloody heavy. There's only two people left.
[01:03:23] Yeah. And so you're pretty much dragging this log up. So are you saying off the log? What do you mean?
[01:03:28] Like you start off? People just fall off and they just pass out. I mean, it's really heavy. You start with
[01:03:34] eight. You've got to, you know, like say two and a half or three miles on an off-road course. It's
[01:03:40] up these, you know, through through rivers and all this sort of stuff. And, uh, usually by the end of it,
[01:03:45] there's only like top couple of people left. Oh, really? Yeah. But there are other people still
[01:03:50] graduate. Uh, they do. But if you fail to events on P company out of the 20 or so events, then you're
[01:03:55] off the course. So when I was, I was later in instructor on P company, usually with the soldiers,
[01:04:01] at least with the recruits, there's only about 10 or 11% pass rate. So we'd start off with a
[01:04:06] platoon of 90 or 100 recruits and we'd pass out 10 or 15. So that's how it's off at this.
[01:04:13] Yeah. Yeah. And how long is the whole training 21 weeks? Uh, yeah. So if we're on a log
[01:04:20] and we're going and I've passed every event, but I, you know, don't carry the log. I've
[01:04:28] go to the side or whatever. Yeah. I can still be a pair of only few, as don't come off one of the other
[01:04:33] events. So if you fail, let's say the assault course of the train A'sium, which is the area of
[01:04:38] assault course where you've got a sort of jump across the high nets and things like that, then you'll
[01:04:41] be off the course. So you can, you can get all the way to the end of the, you know, the course.
[01:04:45] And if you come off, if you fail two of these events, that's you off, then you'll get sent to another
[01:04:49] regiment. Is there a time limit on the log? Uh, imagine if there's only two of you left.
[01:04:54] Like it takes some time. It takes, it takes a while. Yeah. It's staying on is most important and not just
[01:04:58] giving up. In the seal training, you carry a log. You spend a lot of time with a log. But you also
[01:05:05] spend a lot of time with a boat like these little boats that that used to be made out of
[01:05:10] rubberized canvas. So they were really heavy. They're a lot lighter now than they were a good
[01:05:15] injury. But what's interesting, so when I went through, you know, you're carrying the boat on your
[01:05:20] head a lot. And this is sort of why I thought you were saying, you carry the boat on your head a lot.
[01:05:24] And you know, if we're all in a boat crew and there's eight of us in the boat crew,
[01:05:30] it's possible to sort of like shrink your head down a little bit and release your posture a little
[01:05:37] bit and not have your head carrying any weight, which means that everyone else carrying the weight.
[01:05:41] So when I went through it was like a sort of like it was happening and you'd see someone doing it
[01:05:46] and it'd be like, you'd hear people yelling like in another boat. Get your brick and in another
[01:05:50] boat man. Well, they didn't have this, but they haven't now. They have, you can actually you get
[01:05:56] written up for what they call duck boat. So they'd be like Charles, you're ducking boat. And you can
[01:06:02] get like a damaret. They didn't actually call it. They didn't have a name for it when I went through.
[01:06:07] But now they have a freaking name for it because it's like, it's like you're coming off your
[01:06:13] walk. You're not with the team and that's not cool. Well, we have the same thing. I mean,
[01:06:18] because we have that there's a stretcher race. So the same sort of thing where you carry a stretcher
[01:06:21] for five miles that one. So you can get through to the, as certainly as an officer, it's more
[01:06:25] apparent. But if you can get through to the whole course, even if you stayed on all of the events,
[01:06:29] you can get what's called a stand-up fail, which is basically you're still standing up, but
[01:06:34] you're failed on your attitude or personality. So you can still get a booted off if they don't
[01:06:38] like you. Yeah, that's as it should be, right? Because there's some non-conifiable leadership
[01:06:45] policies that some people have or don't have. And if somebody gets someone that's looking
[01:06:49] out for themselves and just trying to step on everyone's back to get to the top, we don't want
[01:06:53] that guy on the team. Yeah. So you get done with that. And now you show up, you show up at the
[01:07:00] regimen. More or less, you're still going to do the infantry battle school. So there's three
[01:07:06] months in Breckin' in Wales where you then go and do, no apologies, that was first, P company,
[01:07:12] and then yeah, that was to the unit. Yeah. So I joined the unit in 2006 just as they, my three
[01:07:21] power of getting back from Afghanistan on the first tour. So it was a pretty, that was a pretty
[01:07:25] punchy tour as well. And so Europe just, you know, it was, you meet, it was new me, straight in charge
[01:07:30] of 30 more veterans, and that was quite daunting challenge. Yeah. What was your, what was your,
[01:07:36] what lessons did you learn from that? Um, well, I'll never forget the day I was, I took over my
[01:07:42] pertune. I met the guys and you know, you sort of towards its handhairs that you're going to have
[01:07:46] this sort of general Montgomery moment where you're sort of, you know, standing on a land Rover,
[01:07:49] sort of addressing your soldiers as they're all on parade. Doesn't really work like that. I sort of
[01:07:53] walked into the barracks and they were all like bed. Oh, could I speak to the guys? So they all
[01:07:58] came together and there was a corporal, a couple of cram tree, Chris Cram tree, big guy, and
[01:08:04] said, sir, can I tell you a joke? He said, yeah, go on. And he said, how many, um, sangin veterans? Does
[01:08:09] it take to change a light bulb? I don't know. He says, of course you don't know. So because you
[01:08:13] weren't fucking there. Oh, thanks. Welcome aboard. But it was, no, it was daunting. But, you know,
[01:08:21] I felt prepared, you know, sandhurst, the injury battle school, peak and it prepares you. It gives
[01:08:26] you that confidence, you know, milling, boxing, all that stuff. So whilst it was like, quite
[01:08:32] something, I'd already, I'd hitchhiked through it, I've got to start, you know, a couple of
[01:08:36] it, a couple of it, a couple of it. I think when some of the guys started learning some of my
[01:08:39] stories, they had a slightly more respectful, than they probably could have had. But it's
[01:08:44] a big challenge, you know, you've got to prove to you, man, they're not going to, they're not
[01:08:47] just going to follow you until they know you're not, you know, not a dick, basically. How long
[01:08:52] is it? Your, um, what's the training like now the guys come home? I'm sure they stand down for a
[01:08:57] little while and then they'd say we got to get ready to go back. So I think the turnaround was
[01:09:01] about 14 months before the next deployment. So there was a little bit of downtime. There was
[01:09:06] plenty of opportunity for the guys to get some rest and do things like adventure training.
[01:09:11] And I mean, there's the story in the book where, as a junior officer, the planning officer said,
[01:09:17] this is the kayak. What is the kayak on you? Oh well, go ahead. So basically the CEO said,
[01:09:24] like, all the new officers, so the six guys that we'd all just come out straight out of Sandears,
[01:09:28] you guys pick a sport each and then get all the guys to go and do something fun. So I said,
[01:09:34] okay, well, I was looking at sports and all my colleagues at, I would have pretty much chosen what
[01:09:38] they were, they're sort of chosen sports were. So somebody did soccer, football, somebody else did,
[01:09:46] you know, ran the rugby team. My only sport, of course, at that time was boxing, but three
[01:09:50] parrots already had very well-established boxing teams. So there's no way I could go and join that.
[01:09:55] So I was sort of scrambling around, thought, okay, well, I'll just do kayaking.
[01:09:59] It sounds like fun. You know, I had done a bit when I was a kid, so I'll do that.
[01:10:03] So I went into sort of, you know, as for volunteers, I got six or seven very unwilling volunteers
[01:10:10] from the soldiers because they'd rather be on leave, but they'd all been told they had to join
[01:10:14] one of these clubs as well. Now, that's when things started getting competitive because the
[01:10:18] parrots being the parrots, the commanding officer sort of then threw into the ring, he said,
[01:10:21] look, you've all got to apply for, whichever sport it is, apply for a competition and you've got
[01:10:26] to win it because you're parrots. So you were just thinking, we put together a kayak. It was
[01:10:30] better than fun. And we'll go out in the river and we'll have some fun and exactly.
[01:10:33] It'll be all good. You can probably travel. You see, you're always trying to find some scam to
[01:10:36] travel. Exactly. Yeah. But then he says, hey, I want competition. So, and I was based on
[01:10:42] place of colchester in Essex. Now, there's no sort of particular venue to go and learn kayaking
[01:10:49] in colchester, pop from the local canal system. Now, this is winter. So, I basically managed to get
[01:10:54] hold a bunch of these boats and we were out paddling in the frozen, dirty waters of Essex
[01:11:01] canals. Now, there's like shopping, probably floating in the water. There was like, you know,
[01:11:05] the homeless guys sort of taken a leak off the bridges, we were going under it. I mean,
[01:11:09] it was that kind of, it was pretty grim. And so the guys were not particularly inspired by this
[01:11:13] by this whole project. And I was trying to find a suitable competition to enter and that the
[01:11:18] main kayaking competition in the UK is basically a race. It's a hundred mile race along the
[01:11:25] tembs from a place called Henley to Westminster. It's called the Devises to Westminster race.
[01:11:32] But that wasn't until May, which was we were meant to be back in the training cycle
[01:11:35] plan. So, the other thing I think are, for find, it was over these two weekend, which was the
[01:11:39] army canoe polo championships, which was in a swimming pool, a pool in a town called Luldershop,
[01:11:45] which is the home of the parents. And so, I applied for this competition. They were like,
[01:11:51] yeah, we don't normally get power as applied, but find, turn up. So, after we, you know, we
[01:11:54] done like several weeks training the guys were just about competence in staying in the boats
[01:11:58] without falling out. But, you know, bile means none of them could do a proper escape of
[01:12:03] all at this stage. So, we turned up on, on Easter weekend. And the guys were all really annoyed
[01:12:08] because it was Easter weekend. They wanted to be a home with their families. And we found the
[01:12:12] swimming pool attendant that the guy was running the competition. He said, oh, you're
[01:12:15] didn't expect you to turn up. And we got now about to set right again the pool. And we
[01:12:20] look at that, where's all the other teams? There was a measure of like six other teams entering.
[01:12:23] He said, well, it's Easter. Obviously, nobody's bothered to do any people here. So, he said,
[01:12:26] well, what does that mean? He said, well, you've got the gold medal. So, out of all the teams that,
[01:12:31] in the Paris did all these sports, we were the only ones to actually win our competition.
[01:12:36] Obviously, we didn't need to tell anyone that nobody else had turned up. We'd won by default.
[01:12:39] But it goes to show, you know, if you, if you, you've got to be in it to win it. So, it's the
[01:12:44] speed. Now, you guys are going, do you know that you're preparing to go to Afghanistan?
[01:12:49] Yeah, we knew. We knew that. So, in the deployment was in the spring of 2008.
[01:12:55] Especially off the back of the first tour that they'd been involved with the Paris or the first of
[01:12:59] the whole British Army to go into Southern Afghanistan into Helmond and it was like I say, it was a,
[01:13:04] it was a very kinetic tour. There was, there was a lot of stories coming out of it. So, there's,
[01:13:09] there's a lot of things to live up to. So, yeah, so we deployed to Helmond and
[01:13:15] Canned Har and we were on something called the Regional Command Group South. So, we were basically
[01:13:20] the rapid response unit to go and fly in helicopters to wherever they needed us. And it was a pretty
[01:13:26] varied role. It was, it was interesting because we weren't in one of the four operating bases,
[01:13:30] like two parrots who were stuck in in one of these fobs for the whole six months. We were bouncing
[01:13:35] around all over the place. Which meant that we would, you know, one day we'd be doing a raid on
[01:13:40] the Taliban commander. Another day we'd be helping the local police builder. Police station,
[01:13:44] another time we'd be going out, clearing the opium. You know, so it was a really interesting,
[01:13:48] varied role. But it did mean that we all had to get our heads into this, you know, 360 degree battle
[01:13:54] space, hybrid warfare, noted two days were the same. And so it was, it was quite a complicated
[01:13:59] environment in which to operate. What did you turn over, where did you get a turn over from somebody
[01:14:03] when you showed up there? Yeah, we did. I think it was the role Marines who were in there before us.
[01:14:09] But the role itself of, of RC South was pretty undefined. So, it was pretty much whatever the brigade
[01:14:15] commander said we'd go do. So, it might be the first job that we did was in a place called Maywanda.
[01:14:21] We had to go and clear this, this town of any, any Taliban elements. I'd read about Maywanda
[01:14:28] from my, my days doing history. And this was a place that the British Army had been in in 1842.
[01:14:34] And it turns out we were stationed in the same fort as the British Army 150 years previously.
[01:14:39] So that was pretty, you know, interesting from somebody who'd studied the region.
[01:14:44] You go into some of your, some of the operations in here and some of the leadership really
[01:14:52] lessons that you learned, which are great lessons. I'm going to the book here. Once on operations
[01:14:57] in Zabul province in southern Afghanistan, my platoon was given the mission to search a village for a
[01:15:02] known terrorist recruiter. For the most part, this involved being invited by friendly women for
[01:15:07] tea, scanning their kitchens and gardens with metal detectors, and then being cursed and told
[01:15:12] the house belonged to an absent uncle. As we dug up room and removed caches of weapon. After
[01:15:17] walking around all day, we were low on the water and needed to get back to the helicopter pick-up
[01:15:21] point, which was five miles away across the desert. As we were leaving the village, I noticed a group of
[01:15:27] men huddled under, huddled around under the shade of a mulberry tree. They looked shifty and stared at
[01:15:33] us as we walked past. One of them wore a white turban and had coal around his eyes looking like a
[01:15:41] Taliban leader. I got the translator to say hello and ask their names, which he doly noted. I reported
[01:15:47] the names by radio to our intelligence cell and they said they were all clear, so we left the men
[01:15:53] and trek back across the desert to where my boss was waiting. By now, the whole platoon was exhausted
[01:15:59] and thirsty. We had not had time to eat all day and the temperature was over 50 degrees Celsius,
[01:16:06] which is like a hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit. One of the soldiers was beginning to wobble
[01:16:11] and I expected it might be heat exhaustion. Then to make matters worse, my boss came over.
[01:16:17] Left, you know that group of men in the village? Yes, well, the one in the white turban. The
[01:16:22] insell now says they want him in for questioning. What the hell? I reported his name on the radio
[01:16:29] and they said he was clear. I know they screwed up. So what now? Well, we've got two hours before
[01:16:35] your helicopter comes, go and get him. I shook my head. I had two hours and it was 10 miles, a 16
[01:16:42] kilometer round trip. In the paras, we have a well-known physical stamina test known as the 10
[01:16:47] Miler, which is a punishing speed march while carrying kit. They can be hard work at home in the rain,
[01:16:54] but out here in the desert, low on water, I knew it might be deadly. I looked at my man and could tell
[01:16:59] that half of them weren't up to it. They were exhausted, but orders were orders. I figured that I could
[01:17:04] do the job with 10 or 12 men, so half of the men could stay behind. I knew that in order to do so,
[01:17:10] I had to get them to buy into the vision and feel ownership. So instead of barking out an order,
[01:17:15] I gathered my section commanders around. I told them the situation and asked them what they thought
[01:17:21] were the best options. A lesson I learned early on is that even if you already know the answer
[01:17:27] asked the question, it makes people feel valued and part of the team and decision-making process.
[01:17:32] It doesn't matter who gets the credit for the decision and when you take your own ego out of the
[01:17:38] equation, it's amazing what happens. Sir, I have an idea, said the youngest corporal, why don't we
[01:17:45] leave half the men behind and take some of their water? I'm sure we can do the job with 10 or 12
[01:17:50] men. Men, that's a great idea. I said padding them on the back. He grin from ear to ear, and I made
[01:17:56] him the point man. I need 12 volunteers to come with me. I said the rest of you can stay here.
[01:18:00] The men looked at each other. The new would be one of the hardest tabs of their life,
[01:18:04] and that it would be dangerous because the Taliban now knew our strength and would have
[01:18:08] time to prepare an attack as they saw us walking back across the desert.
[01:18:12] Private Foster, one of the new soldiers put his hand up. I'll come sir. I need the exercise he
[01:18:16] joked. So Vester was next. Then another and another because we had a strong team bonded with trust.
[01:18:23] I had no shortage of volunteers. Even some of the men who I knew stood no chance of making
[01:18:27] it started to put their hands up because they felt ashamed, but I already had enough. We redistributed
[01:18:32] the water, gridded our teeth, and marched back across the desert to the village where we found the
[01:18:37] man in the white turban arrested him, and marched all the way back again being chased by an angry
[01:18:41] mob of Afghans. It was a hard slog, but one of the most determined team efforts I'd seen in my career.
[01:18:48] To top it off, we later found out that the man in the white turban was at the top of the regional
[01:18:53] most wanted list. That victory and a shared hardship cemented the bonds of the Paltoon even stronger.
[01:19:00] There was nothing that my men didn't think they could accomplish.
[01:19:07] legit, I get it. Often I'll get asked, you know, how can I get my team to buy into the plan?
[01:19:12] I was saying, but then come up with the plan.
[01:19:15] Simple as it. Let them come up with the plan. That's what you do.
[01:19:18] That's something you say you learned it. Where do you think you picked that up? Was it something
[01:19:24] that you saw the instructors doing at San Hurst? Is it what your sergeants ran thing?
[01:19:29] Ran things?
[01:19:30] I'll give you the honest answer. I was actually, I watched a series called Shop.
[01:19:35] I did if you've ever seen it. It was about, thanks so. It was basically about the war at the
[01:19:42] Peninsula War in the 19th century. It was basically a military drama series. It's often referred
[01:19:53] to a military circles because it was a fun war in the sense that it was in her. What's the name of
[01:19:58] this musical shop? Richard Shop. As an SHARP. So an America-We'd say,
[01:20:05] what you're saying right now sounds like SHARP. It's all good. I'm married to a Brit. I kind of understood it.
[01:20:10] So shop is a military officer. He's a commander in the rifles and basically often cited as a sort of
[01:20:20] figurehead in leadership. But I remember watching that as a kid and thinking, he does exactly the same.
[01:20:26] When did the series come out? Oh, it was back in the 1990s. This is an old series by a group
[01:20:30] watching shop. I think that was probably where I first saw that style of leadership. But again,
[01:20:35] of course, it was drilled into a soundhorses and in training to bring your team into the plan.
[01:20:42] If you've got a vision that's great, but you've got to get people to buy into it. I think empowering
[01:20:46] people, letting them take ownership of those ideas is the best way of doing that. Totally agree.
[01:20:55] Yeah, a lot of times even if you think you have the answer and you ask the team what they think,
[01:20:59] they're going to come up with the better answer than you had in the first place. Exactly.
[01:21:01] So it's like, why not just ask them? Yeah. And I think ego is often the downfall of a lot of leaders
[01:21:07] in some ways because it's when you, when you sort of, when you think that, because I'm the leader,
[01:21:12] I have to have the answer. That's when things go wrong, especially in the military context.
[01:21:15] Yeah, 100% 100%. That's a, that's a killer. Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
[01:21:25] So also pays to be lucky sometimes. Another little section back to the book. One day we were
[01:21:33] setting up a temporary encampment on the outskirts of a lush valley. I got the call from my
[01:21:38] commanding officer that a vehicle had been blown up a couple miles away and I was to take my
[01:21:42] puttune out on a rescue mission. Our armored cars had special tracks that could go over any kind of
[01:21:47] terrain. We drove them across the desert and up to the top of an escarbman where the location of
[01:21:52] the explosion had been reported. As we got closer, I looked through the front windscreen and could
[01:21:58] see the remains of a land rover blown to smithereens. I was expecting the worst as there should have
[01:22:05] been four soldiers inside. I called the team medic and told him to get ready to treat any
[01:22:11] surviving casualties. We stopped short by 50 meters in case there were any other bombs nearby. And when
[01:22:18] I got out of my vehicle to my absolute surprise and joy, I saw that all the men were fine. When the
[01:22:23] landmine had exploded, it had sent a shockwave through the car sending everyone in it flying out
[01:22:28] onto the ground. They were all alive and seemingly unharmed. I asked them if they were okay and a
[01:22:33] part from being dizzy and shaken. They not had been walked over to where I was standing.
[01:22:38] There was space in one of our three vehicles. So I put the men in the back of the car at the front
[01:22:42] telling the lead vehicle that we should reverse back out of the danger area because we might be in a
[01:22:47] mind field. It seemed like a sensible option. So that's what we did. Making sure that we stayed
[01:22:53] exactly in our own tracks until we were well clear of the flat plateau. At that point, my three
[01:22:58] vehicles needed to turn around so that we didn't get stuck in a bottleneck between two large cliffs.
[01:23:03] So the front vehicle did a three point turn and pushed around the other two so that it was now
[01:23:09] facing forward again in the lead. We all did the same and drove off down a track back towards the
[01:23:14] encampment and by now I was in vehicle number two where the commander should always be.
[01:23:21] Then just as we left the scraggie bolder field, there was an enormous explosion. And I felt the
[01:23:26] shockwave hit my own car. After a second of deafness and ringing in my ears, I looked through
[01:23:31] my windscreen to see a massive cloud of dust as it cleared. I realized what had happened.
[01:23:36] The point vehicle had driven over another mind. And to make matters worse, it was the same four
[01:23:42] soldiers who had been in the first explosion. I shouted down the radio telling everyone to stop exactly
[01:23:47] where they were. We're whilst I considered the situation. I could see bodies lying in the dirt next to
[01:23:52] the car, which had the front end rip off of it. Now I knew I had to show some real leadership.
[01:24:00] And there was only one thing for it. The metal detectors were in the car at the back and it
[01:24:04] would take them a good 10 minute to clear the path between the cars. Let alone get to the front where
[01:24:09] we might have had heavy casualties. I got out of the car, pulled out my bandet and began to crawl
[01:24:14] forward, stabbing the sand in front of me to check for mines. Luckily the car in front wasn't too far
[01:24:20] and I was able to cover the distance quickly. I reached the car and to my relief found that yet again
[01:24:26] by some miracle everyone was alive. And what's more uningered? One of the soldiers stood up,
[01:24:32] dusted himself off and looked at me stabbing around in the dirt. What are you doing, sir?
[01:24:36] He laughed. You won't find any Taliban down there. It was a lucky day. Made even lucky.
[01:24:41] You're as I was filling out the daily report back at camp when I found out that my team and the
[01:24:45] remaining vehicle had been tasked with denying the half blown up cars that meant going back to the
[01:24:50] site and blowing them up properly with explosives so the Taliban couldn't make use of them in the
[01:24:55] future. It was a simple task and I was told that I should remain behind with the other
[01:24:59] platoon commanders so that we could receive our orders for the next day. As the team were driving back,
[01:25:04] they too hit a land mine and the empty commander's seat where I normally would have been sitting
[01:25:12] was completely destroyed by the explosion. You can't be a leader unless you're willing to put
[01:25:17] your team ahead of yourself when circumstances call for it. This requires moral courage and integrity
[01:25:23] the building blocks not only of great leadership but of a fulfilled purposeful life.
[01:25:28] Just out there digging for mines. There's a lucky day, a very lucky day.
[01:25:37] And no one got in your seat, no one got in your vehicle commander seat.
[01:25:41] Yeah. That was a, yeah. I look back now and thank my lucky stars that, yeah, that was a very lucky day.
[01:25:50] What was the uptempo? So like how often were you guys running out and going out on missions?
[01:25:54] Well, because of the nature of the job, we were like I said doing different things. So we'd go
[01:26:00] out and clear a valley one day. We might be out for a week and we'd come back to Kandar. We were
[01:26:04] based in Kandar area based alongside the Canadians for the most part. Most of the Brits were
[01:26:09] either in Bastion or in, you know, one of the fobs. So it was quite, I mean, Kandar Harb,
[01:26:15] Erbase, you know, had a Timmy Horton's coffee and a pizza hut. It had a burger king. I mean,
[01:26:20] it's a bizarre, it's a experience. So you're out there getting blown at one minute and then you're
[01:26:25] in, you're in with the, with the remps as we all, you're like to call them another and it's such a
[01:26:30] bizarre thing to get your head around. But we weren't in that long, we'd stay for a few days.
[01:26:34] We'd regroup, we'd clean ourselves up and then we'd get back out there. And we did some really
[01:26:39] fascinating, you know, operations. We did, according to the news report, at least, we'd just
[01:26:44] want the biggest airborne assaults of the entire, of the entire war. We flew to, into the bull with,
[01:26:52] kind of how many shunooks, it was like, 10 shunooks with Apache support to do a full battalion level
[01:26:57] assault. And stuff like that when you've got, when you've got right at the varker, he's blaring
[01:27:02] out of the speakers. It was pretty energising to the saber least. Equally, you know, we'd be out there
[01:27:11] helping rebuild a school painter, painter police station in the next shows. It was quite, it was,
[01:27:17] it was challenging on different levels. It wasn't that we were getting as many fights,
[01:27:21] because actually the guys in the fobs were getting attacked every day. They weren't immortal every
[01:27:25] day. We'd often go for it for a week without fire shot in anger. So it wasn't necessarily the,
[01:27:33] the intensity of the fighting, certainly for my tour. It was more of the variety and the scale of
[01:27:38] what we were trying to achieve. How long was the deployment in total? Normally there's six months,
[01:27:42] I needed four months because I was at the end of my tour as a bazoon commander. So my replacement
[01:27:48] was sort of brought in and then I had to move onto another job. So that's when I went to be a,
[01:27:53] an infantry at the recruitment centre. I was then a directing staff sort of recruiting and training
[01:28:00] recruits back where I'd done my training before. And that's a historical deployment for,
[01:28:07] for the paras down there. I know I was doing just some reading about it.
[01:28:12] Yeah, had a corporal Brian bud. He was posh, he was the word of the Victoria Cross. Sounds like he just
[01:28:18] led a flanking maneuver against enemy Taliban fighters and it up being killed, but was able to
[01:28:25] suppress enough fire that the rest of his team could maneuver. There's another guy named
[01:28:29] Corporal Mark Wright awarded the George Cross. Pretty, I mean, just you read the story. It's
[01:28:40] unbelievable story, heartbreaking story, but there in a minefield, there's guys wounded.
[01:28:47] He's, as he's trying to get his guys out of this minefield, like what he's singing happy birthday to
[01:28:52] one of his friends. That's, you know, in a really bad way and he ends up dying wounds, but I mean,
[01:28:57] just a just of incredible bravery and upholding that tradition of the paras, you know, to this day.
[01:29:07] Awesome stuff. When you get back, I know you mentioned in the book that you were
[01:29:17] considering going to selection for the special forces. And then,
[01:29:24] well, that was the, that was the natural progression. Like I say, after the tour,
[01:29:30] it's considered the next step is, is most of the officers then go to back to Catric to then train the next
[01:29:37] baz of recruits. I mean, it wasn't my first choice. I didn't really want to go and be in the wind
[01:29:42] of the rain, training recruits. I would have loved to have spent more time in Afghanistan, but
[01:29:47] that's the way it goes. You know, in the army, so I was up in Catric. I'd say them on my morale
[01:29:52] was sort of flagging a little bit because I would actually, I wouldn't say I necessarily enjoyed
[01:29:58] Afghanistan. Well, I'd do, I live, yeah, I did quite enjoy some of it. But that's why I joined the army.
[01:30:04] And so I was there. I thought, okay, well, you know, a gov-especially forces selection, that will be the next
[01:30:10] thing. So, past all the initial tests and it was meant to be going on the full selection in January
[01:30:16] 2009. And I was at my peak fitness. I was good to go. And then I made the era of going to see my
[01:30:25] girlfriend in Mexico who had a ranch. And in a bout of silliness, I decided to get on the horse
[01:30:34] and do some rodeo on her ranch. The horse threw me over a six-foot war and I broke my leg
[01:30:39] a week before I was meant to be on selection. So, I had to sort of limp in back to the barracks and
[01:30:47] obviously I was told I couldn't do selection. Needless to say, and what was worse was all of the
[01:30:52] jobs for the next deploy, which was going to be happening in a few more months, had already been taken.
[01:30:57] So, it was a crux point in my career and I was like, well, okay, do I stay and then
[01:31:04] do a job that I don't enjoy for two years or do I look at this as an opportunity? And it was
[01:31:11] quite a pretty depressing time because I was desperate to get back out there and do what I
[01:31:15] loved the most. But equally, I didn't really fancy spending two years doing a desk job. That
[01:31:20] wasn't wise on the military at all. So, I rang up my, I said,
[01:31:25] they're not saying about those desk jobs, we just drove them out there. That's not even a thing.
[01:31:29] No, there's no recruiting poster that shows if officer sitting at a desk making a power
[01:31:34] point. Exactly. Yeah. Excellent job. So, I, after sort of really, you know, going through some
[01:31:44] heart-wrenching decision-making, I thought, you know what, I think now's the time to do something
[01:31:48] else. And actually in hindsight, it was because I left Hungary, it was because I left still
[01:31:53] hand-curing for a bit of adventure. And I didn't feel as though I'd done everything I wanted to do
[01:32:00] in, on that side of things that I'd probably, it gave me the impetus to do what came next.
[01:32:04] So, I left them by a twist of luck I suppose when I, because you have to usually give 12 months,
[01:32:11] notice when you leave the military. But when I rang up the army personnel, somebody hadn't
[01:32:16] filled out the paperwork properly. So, I meant that I could actually leave informants. And my boss
[01:32:22] at the time took a look, just take the time off, get yourself together. So, I was on full pay. And
[01:32:26] off I went. So, as soon as my leg was fixed, that was me on to whatever came next. I didn't
[01:32:30] really have a plan other than thinking to that. Other than thinking actually now is probably the
[01:32:37] time I can go back to that schoolboy dream of somehow becoming an explorer.
[01:32:42] Well, what point did you climb mirror peak? Yeah. So, that was in, that was again, that was just
[01:32:48] before I broke my leg, it was in October that year. So, I was, again, it bit of downtime,
[01:32:53] I was given the opportunity to do what, you know, as affectionate as adventure training in the
[01:32:58] army, but it's usually involves doing some hill walking in Wales. I wanted to do something
[01:33:02] a bit more exciting. So, I decided to organize a proper mountaineering exhibition to the Nepal
[01:33:07] Himalayas. So, I got together a bunch of the junior NCOs at Catric who were, you know, my training
[01:33:14] staff and said, let's go and climb a mountain. None of them had climbed a mountain before.
[01:33:18] But being Paris, they all sort of said this sounds like fun. It's three weeks off work. So,
[01:33:23] off we go. And that was my introduction to proper civilian style leadership in many ways,
[01:33:31] because it was, you know, we were not in uniform. We were doing a learning and new skill in a new
[01:33:37] environment. So, off we went and we went to Climera Peak, which is not a technical mountain,
[01:33:43] but it's six and a half thousand meters, which is what's that? That's like, I think it's about 21,000
[01:33:48] for 247 feet. Spot on. Good girl. So, it's a pretty high mountain and the air is thin up there,
[01:33:56] and you know, you can sort of have altitude sickness off, and it's a three-week expedition.
[01:34:01] And it was actually pretty demanding, especially for some of the guys who'd never
[01:34:05] been to that altitude before. And I'd been backpacking in Nepal and I'd done that sort of thing,
[01:34:09] but I'd never, never ever been to that sort of height. So, it was, it was a really interesting lesson
[01:34:15] in motivating soldiers who soldiers loved to complain at the best of times, especially when this
[01:34:21] is their vacation time. So, it was all fun and gamed until we got to sort of five thousand
[01:34:26] meters, so, 15,000 feet, and that's when things get really tough and cold.
[01:34:30] Yeah, you, you break it down really well. I'll go to the book here. After more than 10 days of
[01:34:36] hard trekking, we finally reached the snow line where the temperature is plummeted to minus 27 degrees.
[01:34:43] And with Gail Force winds making the setup of camp a dreadful prospect at least three of the
[01:34:48] others, and I were suffering severe headaches, dehydration, and very cold feet, as we tried
[01:34:52] unsuccessfully to sleep at 5,000 meters. On the summit day, we were greeted with clear conditions.
[01:34:59] But two of the local sherpas decided to remain with the tents in camp rather than the
[01:35:04] center to the top. I led the way with Jordie. I led the way with Jordie and our mountain guide Jason.
[01:35:10] We plotted through the flick snow tied together in case a crevasse opened up. It was punishing
[01:35:15] slow going into every step was hard earned with short gasping breaths. The summit came into view.
[01:35:21] A few hundred meters ahead, but there was no time to celebrate. As we stop for a short break,
[01:35:26] one of the soldiers approached me complaining that he couldn't feel his feet anymore.
[01:35:30] His boots had been on the tight side, and as a result, his toes were right up against the edge of
[01:35:35] the boot. As we'd been trained, I ordered him to remove his boots and socks, and I placed his
[01:35:40] bare toe inside my jacket right up in my armpit, where it would be able to warm up to body
[01:35:46] temperature naturally. As we waited, I saw another soldier shifting about. He told me his feet
[01:35:52] too were numb. And so after a while, I offered the same service to him, but before along my feet,
[01:35:57] we're also getting so cold, they were excruciating. We needed to move. So once we'd taken a rest,
[01:36:02] we pushed on another hundred meters to a crack. By then, just before the final push to the summit,
[01:36:08] disaster struck. A howling wind flared up the valley, followed immediately by a white blanket of
[01:36:13] cloud. I knew instantly that even if it was short lived, it would add time onto our exposure,
[01:36:18] which might mean the difference between someone keeping or losing their toes to frostbite.
[01:36:22] We had trekked for days and planned for months. No one wanted to give up.
[01:36:29] Boss, one of the soldiers shouted, shouted, we can make it. It's not far to go. 200 meters more.
[01:36:34] I looked up into the murky abyss of frozen air and then back at the faces of the two
[01:36:39] shivering soldiers. I was torn. From the looks around me, it was clear the overwhelming urge
[01:36:44] the group was to continue. These were all paratroopers. Men proud of their own hardiness and
[01:36:50] expecting it above all from me, their leader. But I knew that if I decided to continue,
[01:36:56] I was putting all our safety and danger and the fault would be mine alone for any consequences.
[01:37:03] We turned back. I shouted, now. I hauled the youngest of the crew to his feet and pointed
[01:37:08] down the slope back to where the camp, back to the camp where the shirt was weighted for us.
[01:37:13] The most headstrong of the soldiers muttered and shook his head. I didn't say anything or blame him.
[01:37:17] I was disappointed as he was. We all knew that our chance of conquering the mountain was gone
[01:37:23] at least for this expedition. Months of anticipation and weeks of physical training had gone
[01:37:27] to waste. As we got back to the tents and packed up the camp, we were all silent. It wasn't until
[01:37:33] hours later when we descended beyond the snow line and to a sheltered gully where the sun had
[01:37:38] warmed up the rocks that one of the senior soldiers approached me. You made the right call there,
[01:37:43] boss, otherwise we might have died or at the very least. We'd all be missing a few toes.
[01:37:50] As we carried it on down the trail, the disappointment that we felt that not achieving our aim
[01:37:55] seemed to dissipate and we were glad to have come down unscathed, having lived the fight another day.
[01:38:01] I had not wanted to make the decision to turn back. They felt like failure and I was worried
[01:38:06] about the impact it would have on my soldiers estimation of me. But as I discovered afterwards,
[01:38:12] even those who had wanted to continue at the time had a lot of respect for the decision in hindsight.
[01:38:19] Moreover, that defeat instilled a wonderful attitude in those eight soldiers after the expected
[01:38:24] banter and complaining that all soldiers are good at, every single one of them said that the trip
[01:38:29] was one of the highlights of their military career. What's more, many of them later became
[01:38:34] serious climbers and mountaineers and went back to summit Merra Peak.
[01:38:38] If I had made the popular decision that day rather than the right one, it could have been a very
[01:38:46] different story.
[01:38:50] Just another. And look, I usually say this in the beginning of these things. I'm obviously reading
[01:38:54] only like tiny sections of the book. You got to get the book. There's all kinds of lessons
[01:38:58] learned throughout this book about leadership, about discovery, about exploration. Just it's full of them.
[01:39:05] It's still good the book. But that's a good highlight, a good lesson learned, and this is now.
[01:39:10] And so that's sort of your intro to, well, maybe I can do it, maybe I can do something like this
[01:39:15] in this civilian world. Yeah. It was. And so when I left, when I managed to get out of the,
[01:39:20] um, out of the army, like I said, broke my leg, I was disappointed at not being able to do special
[01:39:26] forces selection, but I was still hungry. And that was the, that was the key ingredient because I was
[01:39:30] desperate to do something that I felt was worthwhile. Um, most most of my fellow officers who
[01:39:38] were who left the military, um, at the sort of rank of captain or junior major, they were sort of
[01:39:45] at the process of getting married, setting down and wanting something slightly more stable. You were
[01:39:49] just feeling distantable. And I was just getting water. So a lot of them went to work in London
[01:39:54] and finance or a consultancy, something with a cash. At that stage, I wasn't motivated by
[01:40:00] cash, you know, I just wanted to go and have adventures and approve things. And I was fine.
[01:40:04] You said, I'm going to go have adventure. Yeah, but some of us fun. So I thought there's got to
[01:40:11] be, there's got to be something in this. And so while I was kind of planning on wanting to bring
[01:40:14] together my passions of writing, of, I sort of had an amateur interest in photography, of course,
[01:40:20] travel was kind of at the heart of everything that I did. So I was planning and I was just
[01:40:25] into a friend of mine Tom Bogen, who was, um, and that's also also in the process of, of leaving the
[01:40:30] military. And we came at this idea of setting up some sort of a travel company taking people
[01:40:35] on adventures, expeditions. He saw a few months left to, before he left the military. So in the
[01:40:41] meantime, I volunteered for a, for a charity, a friend of mine had set up a charity in Africa,
[01:40:47] in Malawi. And what they really needed, all the know thing else, was vehicles. They needed a couple
[01:40:52] of ambulances. And so she was like, is there any way you can, you know, somehow, one, you're sitting
[01:40:57] around plotting an extra trip, why not you send me some ambulances, raise some money, or something
[01:41:01] like that. So I said, okay. But we're going to do this the fun way. So I, I basically got together
[01:41:06] a bunch of my friends, um, told them to take two months leave, whatever they were doing. And
[01:41:11] we're going to buy the ambulances on eBay and drive them to Malawi. 10,000 miles away. And that's
[01:41:18] what we did. I managed to raise probably up 50 grand, not a massive amount of money, but bought a
[01:41:22] couple of 20 year old land cruisers off the internet, painted them white, taught myself basic
[01:41:27] mechanics, stuck a flashing light on the top. And off we went. And we drove all the way through
[01:41:31] Europe through the Middle East, went through Syria, you know, all these crazy places and
[01:41:36] two months later went to, you know, finally delivered these ambulances to this little clinic in
[01:41:42] Malawi. And it was such a rewarding experience. I mean, it was a heck of a road trip, but it was, you
[01:41:48] know, it was for a good course. And these ambulances are still being used today to save lives. And
[01:41:52] there was something about that that really, I found really rewarding. And I thought, well, maybe
[01:41:57] if there's a way of commercializing this, I can turn this into a lifestyle. And that's what I did.
[01:42:02] So when Tom finally did leave the army, wind up setting up a company called Supercompers, which basically
[01:42:07] offered military style expeditions in some of the most remote places in the world to civilian
[01:42:13] clients. But with a very military thoughts, we're going from A to B, it's going to be tough.
[01:42:17] Everyone needs to get stuck in. Everyone needs to wash their own dishes. This is not a package
[01:42:21] tool. Let's go. So the first trip, the flagship trip we did was horse riding in Northern Afghanistan.
[01:42:26] Which in 2011 I think that was, I'm hoping to place called the Wakan corridor, which is completely
[01:42:32] unaffected by war and the Taliban. But it was, you know, it sold out. I can't believe it. So the
[01:42:38] how many people? It was only about 12 or so people. So it's small group trips. The next one we did was
[01:42:44] mounting climbing on the Iraq Iran border up in Kurdistan. And that was pretty special too. We're
[01:42:50] going to get across the hard desert in Sudan with camels. We rafed it down the Nile and south
[01:42:56] Sudan, watered across Malagascar, all these sorts of insane trips. But it was so popular. It wasn't
[01:43:02] long before we started getting the likes of Discovery Channel and National Geographic Calling.
[01:43:05] As I'm saying, look, we've seen these kind of trips that you can do. Can you take our journalists
[01:43:09] and our film crews. So that was a bit of a segue into the world of media. And before we knew it,
[01:43:13] we were taking these highly respected film crews and journalists and directors into Syria, Iraq, wherever
[01:43:20] you want it to go. And we met all sorts of people. I mean, I ended up doing sort of a security for
[01:43:25] George Clooney at one point. It was wild. But that was how it sort of led on to.
[01:43:30] Easy and actor or something or a politician. George Clooney. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was an average
[01:43:35] bit of by the Disney. Moving on. Yeah, Coach Ross. Yes, check.
[01:43:40] That was the movie you said. It was like, hey, yeah. At some point, I think it was 2010, you
[01:43:46] started writing your first book. Yes. And you write about it in this book. You write about
[01:43:53] writing your first book. And one of the things you say, you're like talking about the challenge
[01:43:57] of writing a book. And the quote that I liked was you said, are you really going to feel more inspired
[01:44:03] tomorrow? Or do you just need to be firm with yourself and get started? It's going to again,
[01:44:07] it's rationalization. Well, I really don't feel like writing to today. Maybe I can wait until tomorrow.
[01:44:12] So you started writing this book. And you go through your methods, you know, with some, you know,
[01:44:16] about how you lay it out and your very methodical about your writing. How that book, you know,
[01:44:25] what, what do publishers just jumped all over that one, huh? Sadly not. So this was when I was
[01:44:30] trying to set up a business. I was trying to have fun. I was trying to get over the fact that I
[01:44:33] left the army and wasn't, I hadn't quite achieved what we want to do. So I thought, okay, what
[01:44:37] I'm going to do is going to write about that trick that we discussed before when I hitchhiked to
[01:44:41] India. Because I thought it was interesting. Whether anyone else did was another matter. I wrote
[01:44:47] this book, 100,000 words, pitched it to agents, publishers, and basically got told to piss off at every
[01:44:55] turn. Nobody was interested. Nobody cares about your holidays. So it was quite disappointing.
[01:45:03] But I'd written 100,000 words. It was on my laptop. And I thought, okay, maybe this book's not good enough.
[01:45:10] But it's been a really useful learning curve. It's given me an introduction to writing and the process.
[01:45:16] And that inspired me to carry on. And I knew I needed to do something that was more impressive.
[01:45:22] Something that would get picked up. And that's how it led on to the bigger expeditions later on.
[01:45:30] So you were thinking, I've got to do cooler stuff. If I'm going to write a book about it and
[01:45:34] people are actually going to be interested. Exactly. What was the first step towards that?
[01:45:38] What was the trick that you said, all right, this is worth writing about?
[01:45:41] So like I say, I was doing a really harsh writing. I've got to understand. Well, no,
[01:45:47] none of those were big or bold enough. They were all cool trips. But they were too. They were still too
[01:45:51] weak. You know, trips. Oh, you said two weeks. Two weeks. Yeah, these were all like short trips
[01:45:55] that paying clients could come on. And whilst it was fun guiding trips for paying clients,
[01:46:00] it wasn't the kind of stuff that I could write about. But it was all, it was all leading in the
[01:46:05] directions. Well, you guys profitable. Quite the opposite. So I was, I was homeless. I spent three
[01:46:11] years. Oh, you've been homeless until I've worked here. No, but this was proper home. I had,
[01:46:17] I had basically whatever money I'd saved up from the army. I'd invested into this company with my
[01:46:21] buddy, which meant I didn't have any money for rent. So I was basically staying on friends floors
[01:46:28] for three years. But I also had a rule that I'd learned in India. I'd stayed at a good war at the
[01:46:34] the Golden Temple in India. And it's part of the Sikh religion to off-a-hospitality.
[01:46:39] But only for three days and three nights after that, you can move on. So I adopted this,
[01:46:44] I quite liked that because you don't want to like, you know, sort of burn your bridges or
[01:46:49] or outstage or welcome. So I adopted this mentality and I was pretty rigid with it. So for three
[01:46:53] years, I never spent more than three nights in one place. So I stayed with friends and even if they
[01:46:57] insisted, I stayed longer, I said, now I'm going to move on. So I kind of did the big rotation.
[01:47:02] Oh, my friends and London. But it did mean that there was a few occasions where there was gaps.
[01:47:06] So I slept on benches. I'll be honest. I slept outside and whatever it took. And it was a pretty
[01:47:13] tough experience because I was kind of living on one or two meals a day, maximum because that's
[01:47:17] all I could afford, especially in London. It's not cheap. And then I was surviving by going away
[01:47:22] on these short expeditions, where at least my expenses are paid for. You're stoked to go to Afghanistan
[01:47:26] and ride a horse so you can get a meal. Just suck you get fed. Yeah, for sure. And then,
[01:47:30] but whenever I was back in London for like a week or two weeks, I was poor. I had no money.
[01:47:34] What was the uptempo of these trips? How often are you going on those? A lot. You know, it would be
[01:47:39] a beer way for two or three weeks. Then back for a couple of weeks and a wave. So it was basically
[01:47:44] nine or ten months of the year. I was away. Why wasn't the company profitable? I mean, I would
[01:47:48] imagine your clientele must have been people with a lot of money and for them the difference between
[01:47:52] but how much sort of cost? If I wanted to go horseback riding and have Ganeshan, what were you going to
[01:47:56] charge about? Well, it's probably two or three thousand pounds, so five thousand dollars. Okay. So not
[01:48:01] super money. I mean, we were aiming at that high inclined talent, but at that stage, we just didn't
[01:48:05] have the contacts. We didn't know that those circles of people. So we were trying to hammer
[01:48:09] it the more midrange budgets. People who were adventurous who had a bit of cash, but not we're not
[01:48:13] talking billionaires here. We're talking, you know, people at work in the city. I mean, we had
[01:48:17] also people, teachers. I mean, people who just saved up all the earth to do that one particular trip.
[01:48:22] What about your buddy Todd? Tom. Tom. What about him? Where's he living? Well, he was married. So
[01:48:27] he sort of, you know, he'd already sort of managed to game self sorted. So he had to have some
[01:48:32] with a live on like me. So we were in slightly different places. But for me, it was like, you know,
[01:48:39] I was using all of these trips as an opportunity to learn the craft of riding to do more photography.
[01:48:43] So I'd go away and do this horse riding and Afghanistan takes some photographs and I'd try and sell them
[01:48:48] to, you know, lonely planet guidebooks or the newspapers, whatever it might be. So I was trying to build
[01:48:52] up a single piece of stuff. Really? Really baits on that? Yeah, what? It took a while. I mean, I was
[01:48:55] doing my first show of weddings and baby photos, but it all, it was all building up. But it was
[01:49:01] on one of these trips. I was out in South Sudan doing a making a film out there. It was a fishing
[01:49:08] show about a guy that was fishing for an hour per each in the middle of a war zone. The only
[01:49:13] one was he, he didn't really catch any fish, which doesn't make for a particularly good fishing show.
[01:49:19] And when we were back in Juba, which I don't know if you've been to Juba, but it's, it's,
[01:49:23] there's nothing there. I mean, it's, it, the world's news country at the time, South Sudan.
[01:49:27] It had about three miles of paved road in the entire country. I mean, even in the city centre,
[01:49:31] it was just like dirt, huts. So pretty rudimentary place. We were out there trying to make a
[01:49:35] show about fishing, but having not caught any fish. The whole thing was a bit of a disaster.
[01:49:39] Turns out that George Clooney was in town doing some of his humanitarian work. And he, he'd landed,
[01:49:46] we tried to get him on the show. We thought at least if we got George Clooney in the film, it's kind of
[01:49:49] a self, just for the, like, that he's in it. The only problem is that the camera man who was supposed
[01:49:55] to be filming George Clooney, because it was so star-struck, turns out halfway through the
[01:49:58] interview to God's press record. So that was a disaster as well. But we were out there. We,
[01:50:03] kind of, as a reputation with it within the film crew, we thought this, this whole thing's a
[01:50:08] complete mess, this shambles. And we're going to go back to Channel 4 who commissioned this thing
[01:50:12] with our reputation in tatters at this point. So they commissioned your company to film this?
[01:50:18] Wasn't my company. I was just freelance, health and safety guy. I was, you know,
[01:50:22] pot of secret compass, but we'd, you know, we'd basically sort of thought that. You got contracted out.
[01:50:26] Yeah. So, so Channel 4 is paying someone else to make this show. To make the show.
[01:50:30] And you're just a helper. I was a helper doing all the behind the scenes, logistics, safety,
[01:50:35] keeping people fed and more. And you recognize that this isn't going well. This guy hasn't caught
[01:50:40] the freaking fish yet. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't got a fish. George Clooney got a two.
[01:50:44] Show up. Yeah, exactly. I ended up having to be George Clooney's hand double,
[01:50:47] because they screwed up the first start of the interview. I mean, it was like,
[01:50:50] it was pretty bad. But that's how I met a guy called Neil. He was the second,
[01:50:55] he was the producer director on the show, second cameraman. And he said, look,
[01:51:00] look, you know, we could do this ourselves. Why don't we film one of your expeditions?
[01:51:06] You know, cut the crap. Let's go and do something cool. He said, if you got any ideas,
[01:51:10] and we were in South Sudan on the banks of the night. I was sort of looked left and right.
[01:51:13] So it's whopping great. Rick River, I said, well, I wonder if anyone's ever walked the length of
[01:51:16] the river Nile? And he said, well, I'd hardly doubt it. Because it's four or half thousand miles long.
[01:51:21] I'm full of war zones. So I said, well, let's do it. And so that's where the idea was born.
[01:51:26] And I decided I wanted to be the first person to walk the entire length of the river Nile.
[01:51:30] And I thought that's that's big enough and bold enough to write a book about and get published.
[01:51:35] So that was the plan. And that was the plan. That was back in 2012. And it took me about
[01:51:41] almost two years, only 18 months of planning, fundraising, trying to get TV interest,
[01:51:46] trying to get a publisher, all that sort of stuff. But I was determined that come up with out.
[01:51:50] Even if we don't get the support of TV or a book, I'm going to go and do this. And just by
[01:51:54] committing mentally, I think that's what did it. It was the confidence of then just walking into these
[01:52:00] meetings saying, screw you, even if you don't give me any money, I'm doing it. And I think people saw that
[01:52:05] and the sort of the, I guess the credibility of having been a power trooper that got people bought
[01:52:11] into this vision. And somehow, I managed to get a TV commission, a book publishing deal and everything
[01:52:16] else. And got the whole thing fully funded. And so if I went, took nine months, walked four and
[01:52:20] half thousand miles from Rwanda through Tanzania, through Uganda, South Sudan, all the way to the
[01:52:27] Mediterranean in Egypt. And that was a, that was a rough one. I mean, I know, in reading through this,
[01:52:35] you had one of the guys that was with you guy, Matt, Matt, Matthew, power.
[01:52:38] Yeah, Matthew, he was a journalist and yeah, he came out to write about me for a magazine
[01:52:47] and sadly passed away from Heathrow, on the way. And that was a real kick at the ass because,
[01:52:53] it brought it home that this was real. This wasn't just some trip away, stuff can go wrong
[01:52:59] and sadly does go wrong sometimes. But it really brought it home. And it made me really question
[01:53:04] the validity of this. You know, what was what I was doing right, you know, but you know, it happened
[01:53:10] and I thought, I've got to carry on to, I've got to finish this. There is legacy as much as anything
[01:53:16] else to make, if I give up now, then what was the whole point in any of it? So, so this was,
[01:53:24] so a TV crew is with you and they're filming? That's the whole time. No, I mean, the journey,
[01:53:29] at the time when I set off, I didn't know how long this would take. I'd anticipated about a year
[01:53:34] and you know, you can't afford to pay a crew for a 12-month to follow me around. So they came out
[01:53:39] four or five times for anywhere between three or four days in a week. So they were only on the ground,
[01:53:45] probably a total of about a month out of the nine months that I was on my own, all with local guides,
[01:53:51] you know, I was always trying to have a local person with me as an accompaniment, but places like Sudan,
[01:53:55] they couldn't even get in because they weren't issuing journalists visa. So I was on my own
[01:54:00] for like two months in Sudan. How many miles were you doing a day? So I started to do
[01:54:07] probably 10 miles a day in places like Rwando, where it's quite hilly, but when I was really into my
[01:54:14] stride in the desert in Sudan, I mean it was hot, it was sort of August, September time, with 120
[01:54:21] degrees in the desert, but probably averaging 45 to 50 kilometers, so 30 miles a day.
[01:54:30] And then this TV show, this is a TV show, better eventually. So as a veteran,
[01:54:35] no, it's a four-pot series walking the Nile, which then aired in the UK, and in the states and globally,
[01:54:42] and it was a huge success, far more than I'd ever anticipated. But it became a bestseller,
[01:54:47] and yeah, it changed my life, suddenly wasn't homeless anymore.
[01:54:54] When is it like on Netflix, where do you watch it? It was on Discovery Channel in the US,
[01:54:59] it was on Channel 4 in the UK, but you know, you can still find it on line here, still out there.
[01:55:04] Did you feel like these bastards that filmed it only came on this thing for like three weeks?
[01:55:08] Now's out there for nine months? Well, we all became friends and actually to this day, like Neil,
[01:55:13] who is the guy who originally inspired me to do this for TV. We're still, you know, best buddies,
[01:55:19] and I've now set up my own production company, so I make shows for other people and for myself as well,
[01:55:24] and he's on the team. So yeah, we all became very close, so I'm new tend to when you're in those sort of
[01:55:30] circumstances. I mean, we were in South Sudan, in the middle of a war zone, you know, it was,
[01:55:34] I mean, they weren't there at the time, it was just me, but, um,
[01:55:38] I was going to say, because you become close and then they're like, hey, I'm out. I'm back there.
[01:55:42] Two months, well, all the exciting things happened. All the exciting things happened where they
[01:55:46] weren't there. I mean, we were in a place called Bore. This was during the, um, just the, uh,
[01:55:50] the sort of, uh, there's big, big civil war happening in South Sudan. It was, um,
[01:55:55] they just got the new country, but there's still a lot of tribal fighting. I turned up in this
[01:55:58] town called Bore, uh, the same morning that 60 members of a tribe had been murdered inside a
[01:56:04] inside the United Nations refugee camp. Um, do it. The whole thing was kicking off. I found myself
[01:56:09] on top of a, you know, that this bombed out hotel with the rebels approaching on one side,
[01:56:14] you know, Tracer Firegown over heads. There was mortars landing nearby in the only alternative
[01:56:19] pop from watching the fire. It was climbing down the ladder into the river now, which was filled
[01:56:23] with crocodiles. So it was, it was a pretty hairy time. And lots of things, you know, like I said,
[01:56:28] counting and do go wrong, but turns out that makes for good TV. Then you, so you get done with that.
[01:56:37] You, you got a place to live now. You're kind of going in a different direction as far as
[01:56:43] fighting hands with. Uh, but now you got to start plotting on things. Like, are you thinking of
[01:56:48] yourself? All right, I got to one up myself. Well, it came pretty quickly, you know, the, the show
[01:56:54] was successful. Um, I was then asked, you know, literally a couple months later, where's next?
[01:56:59] And of course, people won't be going better. I thought, and I've just walked into the river
[01:57:03] and I'll be, what's bigger and better than that? So I thought, well, what I'm going to do is,
[01:57:07] I don't want to be a one hit wonder or a sort of flash the pan, I need to sort of think the
[01:57:12] long game. So I, I sort of squared it away in my mind, the kind of journeys that I want to do,
[01:57:19] the kind of places that I want to visit. And I wrote down sort of my values, the things that I will
[01:57:24] not move away from. And it was actually going back to my degree in my degree at university. I,
[01:57:30] I'm going to, I'm going to visit places that hold a genuine interest. Um, because at this stage,
[01:57:35] I was getting all sorts of offers to go build, you know, sort of log cabins in, in the woods in Alaska
[01:57:40] and do fishing shows and do cooking shows, all of which are great and interesting. But if I was to
[01:57:46] actually see this as a long term career, I need to sort of call my own niche. And so, um, I thought by
[01:57:52] doing journeys, either on foot or certainly at the slowest pace into places that I've got
[01:57:58] bit of a bad reputation, there's, there's an interesting way of shining a spotlight on places that
[01:58:03] really need it. So I thought, why not pick a geographical feature? I, the Himalayas,
[01:58:08] see in the next obvious choice, the biggest mountain range in the world, mountain Everest,
[01:58:12] and walk the length of that. So I thought I'm going to start at the place that plays very close to my
[01:58:17] heart. I've got my stand in the Pami amount in some walk all the way to the Tibetan plateau. And
[01:58:22] that was another journey of, two and a half or three thousand miles. And that took about six months
[01:58:26] as well. So that was the next big journey which happened 12 months later. And then ever since then,
[01:58:30] I've been doing one big journey pretty much every year since then. Are you going to sort, were you
[01:58:34] solo when you are in the aisle? Uh, well, like I said, I always have a local guide. They were,
[01:58:39] they would change over depending on which country I was in. So I was able to do the entire.
[01:58:43] What about the Himalayas, solo? Uh, again. Other than,
[01:58:46] local guide. Yeah, and the crew would fly out and meet me along the way to film what they thought
[01:58:51] with the bankers. And then, but it, you know, it's always the way that the most interesting
[01:58:56] stuff happens when you're on your own or in a very small crew, because the moment you've got a car,
[01:59:00] with the crew there, things are not quite the same. People sort of close a bit and they're not as
[01:59:05] open. So, a lot of the interesting stuff happens, you know, when you're unaccompanied,
[01:59:10] which is what happened when I was in Nepal and my car has, the one time, the irony of a walking
[01:59:16] expedition is the one time that I decided to get an attack that he, because I was told I couldn't
[01:59:22] camp in it in this particular village and I had to move on to the next. That was when I had
[01:59:25] a pretty big accident. Yeah, I talked a talkerously. You read about it in the book,
[01:59:28] I'll talk us through that one. So, it was, I'll never forget it. I was the 90th August, 2015. I was,
[01:59:36] I was in a town called Musicot with my local guide, Binod, and actually my brother who'd flown out
[01:59:42] to meet me a day before to join me for a week of what was his annual holiday. I know the story,
[01:59:49] so I think it's a bad and your brother. Yeah, cool. You're on classification? Yeah. So,
[01:59:54] so we're in the mountains and it was just, it was almost night time, it was getting dark and most of
[02:00:01] the time, you know, I'd already been walking for three months here. We just camp in villages or stay
[02:00:05] in locals houses, whatever it, whatever it took. But there was a mal-est interaction in this
[02:00:10] pot of Nepal, so the communists were taken over villages and they didn't take kindly to
[02:00:14] foreigners, because you know, they just said, and they weren't aggressive, they just said,
[02:00:18] look, you can't stay here, go to the town and then you can come back to my own car room,
[02:00:23] you walk, but you can't stay in this village because we're having an internal dispute. So we said
[02:00:28] fine, so we got a local taxi, got in it, drove over the mountain pass and just as we were
[02:00:32] going over the crest of the cliff, the brakes failed. So the car goes careering down this, this, this,
[02:00:40] this road and unable to slow down, hits the side of the wall and bounces straight off this,
[02:00:46] this cliff top. And when I say cliff top, it was, it was a huge fall, straight into the forest,
[02:00:52] below about 150 meters, which is what's that, 450 feet to the bottom of the gorge and somehow,
[02:01:00] again, thank you, Malakistan's. Do you ever see Belpaan? There were no seat belts in this car,
[02:01:04] I mean, it's a, I guess the inner bend is one part of the tension, there were her bags.
[02:01:08] What kind of car was it? It was a Mahindra Jeep, so it was a metal frame, thankfully, not some,
[02:01:13] not some cheap stuff, but it was, yeah, it was a straight off the edge and that was me, I thought
[02:01:18] this is a long, how long were you no brick, I'm rolling out the hill. I'm difficult to tell,
[02:01:23] I think probably 10 seconds, I mean, the driver was trying to bounce it against the wall to slow it down,
[02:01:28] but you can imagine these roads, it's just a dirt track, sheer, sheer sort of rock face on the one hand
[02:01:34] and then a drop off, no barriers, nothing like that, and it was just a completely pitch of pitch black
[02:01:39] middle of the night. And that was it, I thought I was a goner and it was almost
[02:01:45] comedic in the sense that it didn't, it literally flew off the edge and we were airborne for
[02:01:51] what felt like an eternity, it was probably just a few seconds, but it was the only part of the,
[02:01:58] the road side where there were no trees because it was forested this, this bank,
[02:02:02] but we went off the bit where there was obviously a river running through, so it just kept on going
[02:02:06] and when we finally did hit the deck, it bounced and rolled and probably rolled 10 times,
[02:02:11] always the bottom of the valley and somehow I stayed in the vehicle, the driver and this random
[02:02:17] other guy that he picked up a local had been thrown through the windscreen somewhere up on the mountain,
[02:02:23] we stayed in the car and yeah, made it always the bottom, at which point I thought I'd lost my
[02:02:30] arm because I couldn't feel it or see it, my money stick. When the car settles, yeah, when it finally
[02:02:36] settles, are you conscious of all time? What are you saying to your brother besides it,
[02:02:42] bro, I'm sorry. Well, it was, I can thank my brother because
[02:02:48] when I, when I sort of figured out where I was, I crawled out the car, thought I'd lost my arm,
[02:02:53] my first instinct was to go find my arm, you know, it's seen on the beach and saving
[02:02:57] private Ryan, where he's looking, he's looking like days and confused, that was me in this car,
[02:03:02] I couldn't find it, then I realized it was still attached, but I couldn't feel it, it was
[02:03:05] pointing the wrong way, it was completely, I mean you can see the scar there,
[02:03:10] I had to sort of snap it back into place, that's when the pain started and I think it was me
[02:03:14] screaming that woke my brother up and he was relatively un-ingered, I mean he'd been bashed around,
[02:03:21] but he hadn't got anything broken, so I couldn't move, I was in such pain, been odd, the guide,
[02:03:25] he was pretty much unconscious and Pete, my brother, he came over and, you know, he's done a
[02:03:34] few trips, but nothing like this, you know, he used working in finance, you know, he's sort of
[02:03:38] for, he's back in finance, you know, well, no, it's the interesting thing, whilst Pete rescued us,
[02:03:43] he went and shouted for help, luckily the sound of the car crashing had woken up some local
[02:03:48] villagers and my, they'd come to investigate, probably to go out and how I may be for
[02:03:53] enough locals to come to carriers out, but then they had to carriers and my, through the jungle,
[02:03:58] to the local village, well you weren't bleeding, I mean, I wasn't bleeding,
[02:04:03] but I was bleeding bleeding, like you weren't, like threatening blood, no, it was just my
[02:04:06] arm was just completely mangled, the driver sadly was in a very different position he'd broken,
[02:04:12] everything is body, it's neck, you know, he was somewhere at the mountains, that's going to
[02:04:16] find him, we were taken to a very small clinic in the local village, and when I say small
[02:04:20] owners like chicken running around the ward, this was basic stuff, but luckily they're, yes,
[02:04:25] they're qualified, it was basic, they were rolling the hospital and chickens, but they had more
[02:04:31] feet, thankfully, so that, you know, took away some of the pain, but yeah my brother, he
[02:04:36] coordinates the rescue, took three days though because it was the rainy season we couldn't get
[02:04:40] helicopter in the road to all washed away, so it took three days for helicopters to come, so
[02:04:45] it was a, it was a trying time, so the least, and I think my brother was possibly regretting his
[02:04:50] his holiday distillation, but yeah, he was a real trooper throughout the whole experience,
[02:04:56] and yeah, so that, that really disrupted the trip a little bit, but I had to fly back to the UK
[02:05:02] for surgery because they couldn't do it in count on due because it was just after the 2015 earthquake
[02:05:06] which had screwed all the hospitals, so I went back to the UK, had surgery for the fix my own,
[02:05:12] but then I couldn't give up, this was my, I'd chosen this, this was my career, I wasn't going to give
[02:05:16] up, so whatever it was, 45 days later I flew back out to Nepal, went back to the car, still there
[02:05:22] in the jungle, rusting over and carried on walking, from another three months, the TV show came out,
[02:05:30] yeah, they came out, they enjoyed that, they like they filmed me in the hospital,
[02:05:33] gave surgery at all, rest of it, and then this becomes another TV show and did you write another
[02:05:39] book about this? Yeah, wrote a book, yeah, called Walk in Himalayas, give it simple, and then they
[02:05:44] of course they said, what's next, so I had to come up with another one, you're paying yourself
[02:05:50] into a corner, Matt? Yeah, absolutely, so what was the next one? Walking the Americas, so I
[02:05:56] wanted to do something in Central America, I'd have this girl from this Mexican girlfriend,
[02:05:59] so I knew Mexico quite well, but I was fascinated by the ancient mine civilization, I wanted to go
[02:06:06] to see places like Honduras and got a Marlera in Colombia because I knew that I would have a bit of
[02:06:13] edge, and so I decided to walk from where the Spanish first landed in the U.C. temperature, give it a bit of
[02:06:20] historical context all the way to South America across the Daryngap, which is probably one of
[02:06:25] the most remote and fierce, most stretch of the jungle, anywhere in the world, so that was another
[02:06:30] six months, another two thousand miles of walking, again, lots of scrapes there as well. And this is the
[02:06:36] same thing, TV crews coming out joining you for four or five days here and there, wherever they think
[02:06:40] there's going to be the most, to mayhem, that's when they're showing up, you're carrying a freaking
[02:06:45] backpack with like a water bottle, and 50 bucks. Yeah, yeah, and off we went, and that was a
[02:06:55] really enjoyable journey because the guy that came with me might my guide for that one was actually
[02:07:00] a guy who had known for a number of years called Alberto, who was the guy that got me into photography
[02:07:04] in the first place and he'd lived in Mexico, he'd never walked anywhere in his life, anywhere,
[02:07:09] and he certainly wasn't a professional guide, he was a studio photographer, he was far more at home,
[02:07:13] sitting on yachts with supermodels, but he had just got divorced and was looking for an adventure,
[02:07:18] so I said, let me come with me, we're going to go and have some fun, and off we went and we walked
[02:07:22] for six months through all these random countries and we went through the ganglands in Honduras,
[02:07:28] met the cartels along the way, we sort of had meetings with all sorts of gangsters,
[02:07:35] it was, that was a wild trip as well. What about a GoPro? I, so I had this little flip camera,
[02:07:42] that you're the interesting thing is actually you'd think sometimes that it would be tricky
[02:07:46] to film in these places, but actually having a camera does open up conversations, people are like,
[02:07:52] oh hang on, I want my first graph taken, or I want you to, I want to tell you my story,
[02:07:56] and particularly in places that don't get many tourists, because if you go to touristy places,
[02:08:01] people aren't that interesting, get the photos taken or telling you their story, but if you go to
[02:08:06] Honduras, I mean there's one story from there, we were in a town called San Pedro Sula,
[02:08:12] which other than Ciada Twaras, I think was the murder capital of the world, this is where the two
[02:08:18] main cartels you've got, MS 13 and Barrio 18, these two rival gangs that do pretty bad things to
[02:08:24] each other are based, they've got their own neighbourhoods, and we wanted to walk straight through
[02:08:32] this city, and the only way to do so was to cross between these two ganglands, but of course the
[02:08:36] police and the army were like, look, we don't go in there, we can't rely on us for backing. So we
[02:08:41] asked around and Alberto was sort of doing all the translation and we eventually found this street
[02:08:45] pastor who said, look, I know the gang leaders are both of these guys, I can probably get you in
[02:08:50] if you want, so I'll ask the question, so he got his, he got two phones out actually, and he
[02:08:55] called the leaders of both gangs and had them on speaker phone next to each other, which is
[02:08:59] bizarre, both of these leaders were both in jail, right, because they were, and he got them,
[02:09:06] they were, and he got them both on speaker phone and said, look, I've got these two two
[02:09:10] gringoes, I mean he wasn't malbusters, and Mexican, but he called us both gringoes and said, look,
[02:09:14] they want to walk through your turf, you know, will you let them, and to my surprise,
[02:09:22] these both these leaders like, yeah, absolutely, you know, as long as you give a fair honest
[02:09:27] representation of our story, you want to tell you our story, and why we have these gangs,
[02:09:32] but he said, just give us twenty fryzers because we're just going to even clean up the graffiti
[02:09:35] and pick up the trash from the streets, they wanted to show the best side of their gang walls,
[02:09:39] and it was the most bizarre experience, but we went through these areas, escorted by these kids,
[02:09:44] ten, twelve year olds, we had covered in tattoos with pistols down there jeans,
[02:09:50] and they showed us the Castle O'Cuz, the Crazy House, where they taught each other,
[02:09:54] and they, they should, oh, this is where we killed, you know, this person, this is where we
[02:09:59] hung, it was like tragic stuff, but in the most surreal setting, and it was, it was a very bizarre
[02:10:05] experience to go and see that, and we saw a guy shot at the side of the street, you know, just in,
[02:10:10] just, yeah, from the gang walls, so, and, and I'm not into voyeurism, I don't go there to sort of
[02:10:16] glamorize any of this, it's trying to show what, you know, the, what the struggle is like for a
[02:10:22] lot of people living in these circumstances and, and not shy away from some of those really difficult
[02:10:27] but compelling stories. Now, did you, did you have a film crew there when you did that section?
[02:10:32] They, they had come out and, and we had a real struggle with the channel to, to sort of,
[02:10:37] allow us to go into these places, because, you know, imagine the lawyers back home,
[02:10:41] and I'm like, well, this is, this is too sketchy, we're not sure about this.
[02:10:44] Plus people with brains back home, they're broke.
[02:10:49] But, you know, I think a lot of it was down to the fact that we'd found this guy who,
[02:10:54] he wasn't a cowboy, he was like, you know, I live, I've lived in these, in, on this, on, in these
[02:10:58] neighborhoods, all my life and sort of the camera come, crew come through or not. So they kept, yeah,
[02:11:02] they came through, they did. So all that footage, and so what's that, what's that show God walk
[02:11:07] walking through? Walking the Americas. Yeah, walking the Americas. How many hours is one of these?
[02:11:12] The series, each one, I mean, the Nile was four episodes, four hours,
[02:11:17] Himalayas was five, I think, walking the Americas as five as well.
[02:11:21] Yeah. Okay, so now you get back from that and you've got to step it up again, right?
[02:11:27] Okay, so the next one. Basically, there's a way you're getting into.
[02:11:30] Going back to my original point of going back to places that I'd studied, my studies at university have
[02:11:35] mainly been about, you know, the Middle East, about places where the old British Empire had
[02:11:40] a legacy, all places in, you know, in the news now, current affairs, and obviously Russia,
[02:11:46] Iran were both pretty high up on the agenda. This was back in 2017, Putin sort of just getting
[02:11:52] reelected all the sort of stuff. So I wanted to go and explore that region more, the Caucasus,
[02:11:56] as a historical region, as fascinating. So I thought one at Doer Journey from Europe into Asia
[02:12:02] over the Caucasus mountains from Russia into Iran. We called that one, crossing the wild frontier.
[02:12:07] So we started on the Black Sea, finished on the Caspy and Sea, and going through places like
[02:12:11] Chechnya, Dajestan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and then finished in Iran. Getting travel permits to go into
[02:12:19] those places was actually quite tricky, but, you know, we had to apply to it to rush in the
[02:12:23] first thing they asked on your visa application is have you or have you ever served in a foreign
[02:12:27] military? So they dig deep into your background. But thankfully, they let me in the same with
[02:12:33] Iran. I mean, they're getting into Iran as a trick you want, because initially they would
[02:12:38] like know where we didn't, you know, especially from the UK, when we're not friends right now.
[02:12:45] Eventually through a contacts, I was told that I could meet a person from the Iranian embassy,
[02:12:51] but not at the embassy. It was just very mysterious lady who wouldn't give me her name,
[02:12:55] but Sunglass is met me in a cafe in South Kensington and London and said, what do you want?
[02:12:59] I said, there's a link to all my shows, go and see for yourself. I gave her a copy of my books,
[02:13:06] and she said, okay, I'll go and read them. And the next day, it was on the present, you know,
[02:13:12] the present sort of promise is desk of Iran and I got approved of visa. And I think what they liked
[02:13:18] is the fact that I'm not there to do on the propaganda, but I'm not showing away from the hard
[02:13:22] story's either, but I'm certainly not there to do investigative journalism to within a gender-based
[02:13:27] sort of approach. I'm there to show what life is like for normal people and they let me in.
[02:13:32] And so I did this amazing trip through places that you just don't get a fair understanding of,
[02:13:40] especially place like Chechnya. And that was a really, really fascinating journey. Thankfully,
[02:13:46] nothing went particularly wrong with that one. I just got a really great understanding of what
[02:13:49] the region was like. Yeah, and I think a lot. You know, a lot of times when people asked me
[02:13:55] and I was just asked this, I was getting interviewed the other day. And you know, people started asking
[02:14:00] about, well, the war in Iraq should we have been there and all this? Was it, is it the moral right
[02:14:06] thing to do? And a lot of times what I try and do in those situations is I try and bring things
[02:14:12] down to a very granular level of what it was like on the ground and what I like about
[02:14:15] what you're doing is you're going beat. I guess the word is beneath the politics. I don't know if
[02:14:23] that's going to sound right, but you're going beneath the political atmosphere to the actual
[02:14:30] other human beings that are living their lives, that are, you know, trying to earn a living,
[02:14:35] trying to raise their family, trying to build their future. And there's so much commonality that
[02:14:40] gets missed. And that's often what I also say about Iraq, you know, it's like I would kick in the door
[02:14:45] to a building and there'd be, you know, a family in there and they, that's trying to build a business
[02:14:51] of selling whatever dates and the moms, you know, trying to so stuff that she can sell in the neighborhood
[02:14:57] and the kids are wanting to play soccer and they're just normal people. And yet you can never
[02:15:03] you can never see that when it's all screened out by the political viewpoint. So what, what's
[02:15:08] this clicking from me now and I'm starting to understand is that you're going beneath that level
[02:15:15] and talking to the people on the ground and getting a real look and probably I'm assuming exposing
[02:15:21] all these commonalities that we have as human beings with other human beings.
[02:15:26] Yeah, and I mean, that was never an outright intention. It's just sort of happened throughout
[02:15:32] these journeys. Is, is trying to find out what does unite as an actually trying to find those human
[02:15:39] stories and then actually there's a lot of positivity and what I found is the sense of hospitality
[02:15:44] you know, has been overwhelming throughout and that I've seen that in some of the places that you
[02:15:49] wouldn't expect it. Yeah, and even even, you know, I start off joking in the early part of this,
[02:15:54] you know, I'll know and whoever invite me in their house and then as I'm sitting in a listening
[02:15:58] view talk and I've been to, I mean, obviously I've been all over the world and been to all kinds
[02:16:01] of different countries and it's the same thing when you actually when you actually get past that
[02:16:06] get but underneath that political vision that we have of a place, you know, I've had people
[02:16:12] treat me unbelievably well all over the world and that's why you have to get, you have to,
[02:16:19] you have to make those human connections with other people and you'll realize, oh yeah,
[02:16:23] they'll help you out. I mean, like you said, most people, they'll give you some water if you
[02:16:29] need some water, they'll pull over the side of the road and help you if you need it. That's absolutely.
[02:16:33] So that's that's a very enlightening. I'll never forget when I was on the Nile, this was back in 2014,
[02:16:40] I was in Sudan and it was, this was a bit with, there's no crew there, it was me with with a local
[02:16:46] guy called Moas and it was getting very hot. We couldn't carry enough water just to survive.
[02:16:51] So we had to go and buy some camels from the local market. Now I don't know how to keep a camel,
[02:16:56] you know, keep a camel going. So we thought we'd better employ a couple of bedwinne camel handlers
[02:17:00] to come with us. So for two months we tracked across the entire Sahara following the river Nile.
[02:17:05] There was one bed of the Nile where we had to go sort of slightly into the desert because there was
[02:17:10] some security issues by the Nile. So we were going through these villages and everyone was so hospital
[02:17:15] people with saying come in, have some of our water and it was almost, it was so overwhelming.
[02:17:21] We were getting slowed down because we needed to reach the Egyptian border before Ramadan because
[02:17:26] that was the basis for which these two camel handles. So we'll come with you but only for 50 days
[02:17:31] because we're going to get back to our families. So that was the deadline. That was the hard stop.
[02:17:36] So off we went and we were getting further and further behind schedule because of the hospitality
[02:17:42] because people say, I'm going to teach my kids English and this is not the other. So my two
[02:17:47] camel handlers were on the verge of revolt at this stage. So we're going to go home if you're going
[02:17:53] to mess around doing your city filming in this time. So we came to an agreement and said okay what
[02:17:58] would do is day on day off. One day we'll go through the villages where we'll meet people and talk
[02:18:02] and film and just you know, all that and then we'll do another day walking in the desert,
[02:18:07] avoiding the villages and camping out in the desert and there but we can come and walk around.
[02:18:11] But there was one occasion where we'd done this within the middle of the desert.
[02:18:16] But a mile away from the nearest village we set up our camp made a little fire and the local
[02:18:20] villages are mile away. Must have seen the flickering of the flames in the desert and wasn't long
[02:18:25] before a crowd of men came out to investigate the support of you doing. And we said, well we explained
[02:18:31] that we were trying to avoid their hospitality. The most polite terms possible and they said they
[02:18:35] were getting really upset by this. So I know you must come and we said no one guy stormed off.
[02:18:40] And he came back half an hour later. He carried a bed on his head and he said if you're not
[02:18:44] going to come into my house, my home is coming to you. And that I think really demonstrates the
[02:18:50] incredible hospitality. I can't remember. I can't ever imagine that happening back in London if
[02:18:54] a student he's my sort of fussy gun on the street. But it's moments like that that really do
[02:18:59] kind of restore your faith in humankind. But you still have to step it up a little bit. It seems
[02:19:06] like we're just getting more and more hostile environments. And so now it's like 2017, 2018,
[02:19:14] the freaking war and Iraq and Syria with ISIS is just flaring up. So of course you're like a
[02:19:22] moth drawn to the fire. So that's the next one, right? So I'd always been fascinated by the mid
[02:19:28] least. Like I mentioned before I in 2003 I was in Iraq. I like the way you kick these stories off
[02:19:35] with like I've always been fascinated with you know how sharp a shark's teeth could be.
[02:19:42] All right so you got this fascination with the Middle East. So I've been there in 2003 which is
[02:19:46] when I hitchhiked through Baghdad and all this you know. So I'd wanted to return to Iraq and wanted
[02:19:53] to see more of the region ever since and I actually in fact after the Nile I pitched the idea of
[02:19:58] doing a trip around the Arabian Peninsula to the powers that be within TV. And sadly they said no
[02:20:05] they said one it's probably too dangerous and two they didn't feel as though there was sufficient
[02:20:11] interest they said. In fact the word the exact words were that's just the realm of current
[02:20:16] fers and news. Nobody's interested in the Middle East as a destination. It was a place to
[02:20:20] to find out more about. And I thought that was just a disappointing answer. So you're on I'd
[02:20:24] pitched this you know after the Himalayas I pitched it again they said no it's to the Americas
[02:20:28] after that I pitched it again they said no again. And that just wound me up. So after the Russia to
[02:20:33] run expedition I was like I am doing the Middle East I want to go to Arabia come want me with or
[02:20:39] you. So I've pretty much you know got told no we're not doing it by by the TV company by the TV
[02:20:45] guys and then I said well I'm doing it which didn't get out well in TV land in the UK but I decided
[02:20:51] that was that problem. So I set up my introduction company to facilitate this. When you say TV people
[02:20:57] these are the channel. This is the channel. This is the channel. And your pitching is it multiple
[02:21:02] channels that your pitching to is. No this is just like straight up one of the top. It wasn't the
[02:21:06] museum it was it was it was channel 4. They but you know it then got syndicates now to discover
[02:21:13] channel and whoever wants to buy it internationally. So you're pitching to the people that have
[02:21:18] made your other shows. Hey let me do this one and they're like look no not happening and you
[02:21:24] just say all right cool I'm doing it anyways. Yeah so I went to I got sacked but I kind of they said
[02:21:30] okay well you're not working with us if that's the case so I said okay that's fine I'm going to
[02:21:33] go do it. So I set up my introduction company and basically self finance this expedition with a
[02:21:39] couple of mates my friend Dave and Simon who chipped in and going back to that thing about
[02:21:44] empowering people and bringing people on the team I said look if we all chip in the same amount of
[02:21:47] cash we'll take up the same amount of profit at the end of the day and they said okay and these
[02:21:52] guys who'd help me before on shows doing the health and safety and I got Neil my got my mate
[02:21:56] who's the director to come on board so we basically just club together and off we went and actually
[02:22:01] it freed up so many things because I was getting more and more frustrated with more and more
[02:22:07] restrictions and limitations on how things were produced and and actually I felt like my creative
[02:22:13] sort of my personal creative spirit was being somewhat suppressed a little bit so I said okay I'm
[02:22:18] going to give this a go what's the worst that can happen so we decided to go and just do this and
[02:22:23] the idea was to go and look at the Arabian Peninsula and all the countries that make that up
[02:22:31] in the same way not necessarily walking the whole route this time because there's a lot of
[02:22:36] empty empty stretch of desert where not much goes on but but certainly hitchhiking and traveling
[02:22:40] with locals so the plan was to start up on the Turkish border with with Syria up in
[02:22:46] Rajava and the Kurdish region and basically walk travel hitchhike whatever all the way around the
[02:22:52] entire Gulf and then finish up at Lebanon in the in the historic city of Biblos which is the
[02:22:57] oldest city in the world and revisit some of these places I've been to my earlier travels including
[02:23:03] Baghdad and to create a Mosul now of course this was in the height of the war against ISIS they
[02:23:08] still weren't defeated in Syria in Iraq so it was a pretty big challenge but doing it very
[02:23:15] light footprint it was only there was only ever three others traveling at once we it meant
[02:23:19] that we could actually go and achieve something that had never been done before which is actually
[02:23:22] travel through all these multiple countries so going through places like Syria we're embedded
[02:23:28] with the the Kurdish militia in Iraq we managed to join a group called the Hashtad the PMF
[02:23:36] the popular mobilisation forces who are sometimes the bad guys but these are the guys fighting
[02:23:41] against ISIS on this occasion but they're also Iranian backed militias I was embedded with them
[02:23:47] on the final awejya offensive which is the final battle against ISIS in Iraq on the front line
[02:23:53] I mean that was that was something else I mean it was it was an entire Afghan tour in three days
[02:23:59] I mean it was it was intense but now you guys are now you guys are the camera crew
[02:24:05] all the just the three of us yeah so now you got cameras rolling all the time and I watched
[02:24:09] some of your some of this stuff that's on YouTube I watch you rolling up to that offensive
[02:24:14] and the guys like all right lunch break and there's some you know having work with the Iraqi soldiers
[02:24:19] of bombs I was like I know what's going on there I know what that feels like yeah um but but
[02:24:26] like what was what was the proximity to the fighting that were you getting right in it?
[02:24:30] I know it was a it was kind of bizarre experience because we managed to hitch a life to the front line
[02:24:35] where these sort of that you know the the Iraqi volunteers these weren't the Iraqi army these
[02:24:40] were literally the guys too old or too young to join the join the military and they were fighting
[02:24:45] on their home turf they were fighting their neighbors so these were mainly sheer
[02:24:49] militia and fighters who volunteered mainly to come out of retirement to basically
[02:24:52] going you know kick ISIS off the of the land so we were rolling up not I mean they had about
[02:24:58] 12 main battle tanks but mostly these guys were in flip flops and Toyota pickups you know
[02:25:04] with it with a 50 km on the on the back and driving in a straight line no-tath no-tactic
[02:25:08] no strategy literally taxi to the front line so we got a taxi to the front line said drop us off here
[02:25:14] hitched ride on a tank just jumped on a tank and just drove the main the point vehicle was a bulldozer
[02:25:20] with this Iraqi dude with a cowboy hat absolutely crazy yes smoking a cigar as the bullets were
[02:25:27] pinging off the front of this bulldozer and it was just a straight line waiting to get ambushed and
[02:25:31] we got ambushed and you know you could see the black flags of ISIS in these villages and we just
[02:25:35] drive up to and spread out bond the shit out of it and then go in there and we were in the mix you
[02:25:40] know right on the front line filming everything and liberating these villages and capturing
[02:25:46] ISIS we caught three ISIS commanders and I've still got a f*** so we're on the flags at home actually
[02:25:50] that took with me but it was it was quite it it felt very important to an historical moment you
[02:25:57] know these when the villagers were liberating they caught the like the commander the ISIS
[02:26:01] fighters the women would come out they'd rip their burgers off and they were thanking these Iraqi
[02:26:06] volunteers for for rescue and some of these women hadn't been outside of their own compound for three
[02:26:11] years so it was it was a very powerful thing to it to be witnessed too yeah we had another guest on
[02:26:18] and covered another book on here Holly who's book only cry for the living and she
[02:26:25] interviewed a lot of those women and what they went through so you know liberation was the
[02:26:32] the understatement of the year for what was happening to the people inside those villages that were
[02:26:38] you know and cities that were run by ISIS did you what you you're not I know that you're you
[02:26:47] don't carry a weapon when you do this stuff you just wearing body armor we managed to pick up some
[02:26:53] body armor from a bill you know to bought something local shop and not off you go but yeah going through
[02:27:01] this sort of the urban fighting in place that shark out I mean we were emotional this is a week or two
[02:27:06] after it had been liberated for ISIS I mean there was there was still a lot of clear operations going on
[02:27:12] you've obviously got to be careful but you know I've been doing this for long enough to know what
[02:27:16] to do and what not to do but at the same time we wanted to we wanted to see what was going on
[02:27:20] because nobody was filming this you know the any news reports that were coming out were coming out
[02:27:23] from Baghdad or a bill that's very few people were getting onto the front line and actually seeing
[02:27:27] what life is like for on both sides you know and we we met these ISIS fighters we got a camera in the face
[02:27:32] and that that was quite rare so it was it was fascinating to to see what was going on and to see
[02:27:38] the reality of life and and these guys the the volunteers who were fighting they've been fighting
[02:27:42] solidly for three years so you mentioned that the lunch break coming literally in the middle of the battle
[02:27:46] that the truck turned up with with the chicken sandwiches on on the back and and people just
[02:27:52] stopped there like well the fight's not going anywhere everyone just sat down and and had the chicken
[02:27:57] sandwich and then carried on and it was it was a kind of bizarre experience but it was no different
[02:28:01] to be on exercise in social reclaiming with it with the British Army really.
[02:28:08] As you as you wrap up getting well like how how did you how did you decide it's time to move on
[02:28:14] was it when was it like my zool is now pretty much done was it what what made you decide all right
[02:28:19] we can we can move on now. So on the last day I mean we've been attached with these guys we'd
[02:28:24] seen Mosul we've been attached to the to the to the to the front line fighting units for a couple of days
[02:28:30] there was one guy I mean it kind of it all sunk in I mean one we'd we'd kind of got enough fighting
[02:28:35] footage and we didn't want this show to be entirely about the fighting but but two I meant this one guy
[02:28:40] we've been told we must meet him his name was Abutasine now Abutasine his nickname was the Hawkeye he was
[02:28:46] a rax most feared sniper he'd been fighting he was 65 years old he'd fought in every war since
[02:28:53] 1973 against the Israelis he'd fought in Bosnia and chicken year he'd fought in 91 and in the golf
[02:29:00] against you know the Americans he'd fought in 2003 against the British and Badgeroh he'd fought in 2007
[02:29:06] against you probably in in in Iraq in fulludioro and any come out of retirement to fight against
[02:29:14] ISIS. So yeah she had guy. He's a she had guy. Yeah and he was literally a rax most feared warrior I mean
[02:29:20] they'd been a booktrick about him and he was there fighting on his most bike with his big you know
[02:29:26] six foot sniper rifle and he agreed to speak to me he didn't normally do journalists interviews
[02:29:32] particularly not with with with Brits that's for sure but he agreed to speak to me sort of soldiers
[02:29:38] soldier when I sort of told him I was in the in the Paris and he said well I've you know
[02:29:42] probably killed some of your friends as long as you don't mind that and it was a big decision to
[02:29:46] have gone sit with this guy who had been my person and then be but and then be against my colleagues
[02:29:51] and friends but you kind of have to take that emotion out of it and it ultimately was in his
[02:29:58] country listening to his story and by the way now he was fighting against an enemy of
[02:30:03] often and yeah so he was British over on the American extent of and of humanity sure
[02:30:10] so we were centered around the campfire and he's a whole bit of story killed 400 odd people
[02:30:15] he was quite open about the fact that he was against you know others the coalition
[02:30:20] invading his country but we were on the right side of history this time around and he
[02:30:24] thought that what he was doing with the right thing which was to to rid his land of ISIS which
[02:30:29] he was convinced was a creation of the chaos of you know ten years of war and I think it was that moment
[02:30:37] I thought okay enough enough I've heard I've heard the story we should move on and it was probably
[02:30:41] about time actually because sadly seven days later he was himself killed by ISIS on that same battle
[02:30:47] on the last day of the war against ISIS so some sort of poetry in that but we left that behind
[02:30:54] and carried on the journey and continued around the Gulf and and like I said I didn't want
[02:31:00] this journey to be just about the conflict because that's what we associate so much with with the region
[02:31:05] but to then jump out of Iraq and then be in southern Iraq actually we were in the in amongst the
[02:31:10] the marshes around Nazarene Badrera you know this is the birthplace of civilisation god and
[02:31:15] of Eden and so on and to be in amongst the marsh Arabs I don't know if you served down there with
[02:31:21] these these these are very traditional tribes who literally you know live amongst the marshes in
[02:31:29] these in these ancient ways of living in the hot and called Mudhif and you know fishing and
[02:31:36] and farming buffalo I mean it's like going back to biblical times and it was that start contrast
[02:31:41] you know which was for me really really interesting and I wanted to give that balance and then
[02:31:46] to go from there into QA to then to do buy where you suddenly got these skyscrapers and
[02:31:52] Friday boozy brunches I wanted to show that whole spectrum of what life is like in in this region
[02:31:58] and it was some sort of really start contrast and to get your head into that and around that was
[02:32:02] was often quite difficult. I mean Dubai is just crazy it's crazy yeah like especially when you
[02:32:07] talk about that contrast between Mosul completely destroyed and you know just a living hell for
[02:32:13] everyone that's up there then you go to Dubai which is just I mean it's sort of a tomorrow yeah
[02:32:20] the entire city has been built for like 20 years or something like that and just everything is
[02:32:26] brand new and to the the highest standards of luxury in everything it's like
[02:32:32] you can't get more of a start contrast. It was a huge amount I mean I actually quite enjoyed
[02:32:37] going and it was a nice break having been in on this war zone for the first time. Yeah you probably
[02:32:41] got confused but you start like a bed. But that's what I wanted to show you I wanted to show
[02:32:47] these really start differences and this traditional way of life the beduined you know I studied
[02:32:52] all about Lawrence Arabia and the old sort of arabist explorers people like Wolf with
[02:32:57] Essageau who crossed the empty quarter and so to then go from there into a man which is a
[02:33:02] beautiful country you've got these amazing endless and dunes and very traditional way of life
[02:33:08] there and then it's Yemen again a country that was incredibly difficult to get into but we somehow
[02:33:14] managed it. It was yeah showed a fair representation. You get done with this trip and then you go
[02:33:22] back so how long is it take when you get done with the trip how long is it take for the production
[02:33:25] to have happened and then what did you do in this particular case did you now have to sell
[02:33:29] what you made? Well exactly yeah so with this one you know I got my own team on the case so we were
[02:33:35] editing on the go I mean we're kind of sending the rushes back and then we got an edit you know
[02:33:39] got an edit suite and we were doing it on the go so I think it ended up being
[02:33:43] then we got back from the trip in February March and it was on TV sort of two or three months later.
[02:33:48] Who did you go back to channel for them? They wouldn't take it. They were principal
[02:33:54] and they said principal little bit of the top to you but we sold it to discover a channel in the UK
[02:33:58] and then they're like what? And then it got shortlisted for a broadcast award so yeah that was
[02:34:05] that was a real sense of not just vindication but you know it was it was a very very good documentary
[02:34:11] and for me it took it back to the the organic authentic roots of what my journey's ultimately
[02:34:17] all and is that one also like four or five hours four or five shows yeah that one's five episodes as well.
[02:34:24] Were you profitable did you make money? It was just face just about didn't make that much money on it
[02:34:29] but it was worth it just because it set the ball very very high. So you get done with that one
[02:34:38] what how do you measure success on those in terms of I mean is it view like hey a YouTube video
[02:34:44] gets whatever a million views how are you judging success or if it's hitting the people right
[02:34:51] or is it just feedback from people telling you hey that was outstanding I never understood
[02:34:55] the Middle East like that now I do thank you is it how are you getting your your gratification?
[02:35:01] So for me the validation it's not just about ratings because obviously that's a lot to do with
[02:35:06] the the media landscape and the current politics of what's going on it's changed enormously just
[02:35:11] in the seven or eight years that I've been doing this you know in terms of TV what is you know
[02:35:16] it's changed enormously with the amount of streaming platforms out there the sheer you know
[02:35:23] just difference in demographics so people aren't watching TV live anymore they're watching on
[02:35:27] their laptop so watching on the mobile so and there's so many new new s-folds out there anyway so it's
[02:35:32] very difficult to sort of gauge in terms of ratings a lot of the stream pluffles don't even publish
[02:35:36] there viewing figures so I don't think for and that for me was never really as important as just
[02:35:42] doing what felt authentic and true to my own belief really and if there's a bit of feedback
[02:35:50] that's good and positive then great I mean you know of course when you go to controversial
[02:35:54] place you're going to get a bit of flack from different groups you know you didn't show my
[02:35:59] tribe and what we do or especially if you go to like the whole Israel Palestine question or if
[02:36:03] you're traveling in somewhere like Iran you know it's difficult it's difficult to tell everyone
[02:36:08] story you never gonna succeed in that but for me it was actually the slightly
[02:36:14] indirect feedback when when you get the head of a charity saying thank you you know we've been
[02:36:20] trying to put our country on the map for the last 20 years and just one of your episodes is
[02:36:26] double that revenue or something like that or you get individuals who call you and say you
[02:36:31] inspire me to quit my job in finance and you know go build a clinic in Nepal whatever it might
[02:36:37] be and as a result you know I've personally been asked to be an ambassador for probably hundreds
[02:36:43] of charities I'm currently ambassador for about 20 or so charities and it's things like that
[02:36:47] that make it all worthwhile for me so I'm not really that bother about the ratings obviously it's nice
[02:36:51] to get good feedback and it's nice to keep getting asked to do these journeys but it's hard now
[02:36:57] to do bigger and better when I feel as I've kind of done most of the journeys that I've
[02:37:02] really wanted to so I'm just trying to think about how do I diversify or stay true to my
[02:37:08] true to my sort of core beliefs but also to enjoy what I'm doing so I'm fun and yeah
[02:37:16] try and find something that's appropriate and useful. Did the so the next one was walking
[02:37:23] with the elephant says that right sure that coming after that came after yep so eventually they came
[02:37:27] back they came back with us sort of saying oh can you make another one for us so you kind of won
[02:37:32] strategic so I went in the end I guess in that way so yeah they came back and said we want to
[02:37:37] we want to do some eels and I've always been fascinated by conservation once again there he goes again
[02:37:43] he said that always been fascinated by conservation so I was wondering
[02:37:46] elephant's always been my thing when I was 10 years old I sort of I don't I've been begging
[02:37:54] my parents to take me to Kenya to go and see elephants and they couldn't afford it because
[02:37:58] they were teachers but eventually they did when I was I think I was 14 and it was my
[02:38:01] but I'm you know seeing Africa big skies the Savannah the wildlife so I had always wanted
[02:38:08] to try and incorporate a sort of an element of giving back in all my expressions so I always
[02:38:13] paired with the charity or or raising a shawl I'm a high net worth of which got a high high profile
[02:38:18] supporter for unicef so I do I do a bit of work with sort of children's charities along the way
[02:38:26] but conservation is it is something that I think is really important not just for the sake of
[02:38:31] animals but but habitats keeping wilderness areas wild and so I thought by going back to Africa
[02:38:38] particularly Botswana in this case and there's a real opportunity here to showcase what's happening
[02:38:45] in the natural world and by doing one of my sort of walks through a country but this time following
[02:38:51] her her developments on the ancient migration route there's a new way of telling this story
[02:38:56] so I was walking with her developments for 650 miles across Botswana all the way to the
[02:39:01] Occupang Hotel to how many often well there's 120,000 in Botswana how many were you are
[02:39:06] in the park and with them I mean it just dependent on the day really but we're getting pretty close to
[02:39:11] so pretty big groups like 10 or like 100 no it could be 30 50 yeah it's probably 50 was the
[02:39:16] maximum we saw it anyone did you get to my awesome of them you get to know some of the
[02:39:20] personalities yeah especially when they're flopping their ears and chasing after you
[02:39:25] but I mean it was a really really intense experience because you're when you're in an alien environment
[02:39:32] on the one hand that you're on your your on your guard the whole time you've got to watch out
[02:39:37] because at any time not just from the elephants but you know a snake like when you're
[02:39:41] when you're sort of out taking a dump as a snake might go and bite on the ass or whatever in my
[02:39:44] be you've got to be really careful we were camping the whole time staying inside the national parks
[02:39:50] we've got a very we we were sort of greeted with them by the Botswana government with with
[02:39:54] the outlustrous back because they said look you know not only encouraging tourism showcasing the
[02:39:58] Botswana such a tourism conservation success actually and and so we were able to camp inside
[02:40:05] these national parks and and really gets to know the wildlife but I'd say that as human beings coming
[02:40:11] from Africa that's what we're designed it we meant to be you know in that natural environment
[02:40:15] so it did feel like a very natural journey as well and that was that was the last big trip
[02:40:21] that you took that brings us up to current date pretty much that was in the summer of 2019
[02:40:26] last year doesn't count because of COVID so yeah that kind of brings us up to date on on this
[02:40:31] sort of big journey is ready so that's probably a pretty good place to stop other than to say so
[02:40:37] what the your latest book that's about to come out is the book that I've been referring back to
[02:40:42] some of but somewhat today the art of exploration so what what what made you decide you had
[02:40:46] need to get another because this is like what do we say was your ninth book this is my this is number
[02:40:51] nine and the last 12 months having been somewhat locked up as give me plenty of opportunity to
[02:40:58] reflect on some of the stories that I didn't put in my other books and I wanted to sort of
[02:41:04] I guess give some of the lessons that I've learned personally but not just that it lessons from
[02:41:09] other explorers from other key leaders and and reflect back on my time in the army as well so it
[02:41:16] really it's a bit of a summing up for me of the last sort of 10-15 years really of the lessons that
[02:41:22] I've learned and I've tried to put them into relevant themes and make them applicable and relevant
[02:41:27] to people in their daily life so it's not just me telling ten of my war stories this is
[02:41:31] some of the stories hopefully will all inspire people to hopefully you know integrate them into
[02:41:37] their own lives yeah I don't think I did a great job of what I selected to read in terms of the fact that
[02:41:41] you're you're you're you're kind of given your philosophy much throughout much of the book and
[02:41:48] you're explaining you know what lesson you learned but you know here's how I learned the lesson
[02:41:52] then you explain well this is what the lesson was and this is how you can apply it so it's a it's a
[02:41:56] it's a philosophical book as well not just like you said a book I read stories I read a lot of
[02:42:01] stories I like to read stories but and you know some of I said here's some of the leadership
[02:42:05] lessons you learned and I pointed out the the way that you lay those out so that people can and you
[02:42:10] it's not just about leadership though it's about decision making you got a whole section and
[02:42:14] they're about how you sort of lay out decision making based on your military education and what
[02:42:20] so there's all kinds of things that you can pull from this book and they're all rooted in what
[02:42:27] you've been through which is again that's where my all my books are just hey this is what I've
[02:42:31] been through and here's what I took away from it so you did this exact same thing and and anybody
[02:42:37] that's listening you're gonna you're gonna pull a lot of lessons out of this book I scratch the
[02:42:44] surface I let read less than 5% of this book on the air today so pick up the book it's freaking
[02:42:52] yeah I mean it's just just chalk as you would say in England it's chalk full of lessons learned
[02:42:58] where can people find you I know you got Levison Wood dot com what's Levison it's a family name right
[02:43:05] it's my that was my dad's name and his dad's name like it's just like on the fifth year
[02:43:12] but yeah no people can find out more about it on what I've got an Instagram page
[02:43:15] Levison dot wood I've got Twitter and yeah the new book is coming out in June in the UK
[02:43:22] and hopefully it will be out in the US shortly after yeah we need to get the pre order on Amazon
[02:43:28] yeah by the way yeah like you got about two weeks for today to make that happen to go uh echo
[02:43:35] Charles is any questions from anything else uh remember when you lost your wallet remember
[02:43:43] do you think if you didn't lose your wallet you would not have gone into the military when you think about it
[02:43:51] I think that you know when I lost my wallet the inspiration you know the main lesson that I learnt
[02:43:55] there was kind of told by this young lieutenant who found it was go-in travel and and perhaps if I
[02:44:01] hadn't have traveled if I hadn't have got those expert early experiences if I hadn't have
[02:44:05] had the gun pulled on me by the the guy in the taxi in Zimbabwe then maybe I wouldn't have enough
[02:44:12] stories to get me through the interviews that got me into the army so who knows I mean hindsight
[02:44:16] obviously a great thing but but yeah I think you know take opportunities when when they come
[02:44:22] come along say thank you to people you know you never know be courteous and it's it's you know
[02:44:30] writing back to that guy and just say thank you for handing all it back you know got me
[02:44:35] all those tips in the form of that six page essay so it's just little things like that it's just
[02:44:40] it's never passed by an opportunity and never passed by an opportunity to to be thankful and grateful
[02:44:45] and no matter how bad things get there's always an opportunity in that and so like when I wrote my
[02:44:50] leg and couldn't get in the special forces I now look back and join the dots and think actually
[02:44:54] it was that it was that well I thought was a low point actually was a real opportunity to go
[02:45:00] into something different yeah this crazy huh because on the surface you're like dang I lost my wallet
[02:45:06] because that sucks and I can't you lose your wallet oh man brutal and then yeah man it opens up this
[02:45:13] whole thing and it's like dang I'm kind of glad I did lose my wallet yeah of course at least I'm
[02:45:16] having a bit of faith that in every situation now whenever I'm feeling ah you know down at that
[02:45:21] that's gone really badly I'd remember myself all the times that the bad situations if you just
[02:45:25] view them right and have the right attitude then then you can turn defeat into victory and and I think
[02:45:32] that's what you got to remind yourself so when everything's really badly I try and just convince
[02:45:35] myself even if it's like a delusional that this is a great opportunity
[02:45:41] absolutely true man absolutely true well like I said probably a good place to wrap work
[02:45:46] approaching three hours right now thanks for joining us absolutely and and more important thanks
[02:45:53] for your service thanks your service to great Britain one of our maybe our most maybe our strongest
[02:46:02] ally not only for your service but your your fathers and your grandfather's I know I watched a
[02:46:08] video about your grandfather and it was just awesome that that that he was out there like you holding
[02:46:15] the line against tyranny and evil and thanks for sharing some of your stories I need you
[02:46:22] following me on like I said there's ten books I always try and prepare I couldn't read ten books
[02:46:28] get ready for this thing um to a ton of great stories and and the lessons that you you share
[02:46:34] and the experiences allow all of us to learn through your vicariously through your explorations of
[02:46:45] the world which you've made the best of I don't recommend them but I'm glad you did them and
[02:46:53] I'm glad we can take away those lessons bands awesome awesome to meet you man thanks for
[02:46:56] thank you so much thank you both and with that Levison Wood has left the building he left the building
[02:47:06] he wasn't he didn't have anything with him so he may be going I don't know he's going somewhere
[02:47:12] we don't know where he came in we don't know where he came from we don't know where he's going
[02:47:16] but he is out there all on the continual exploration with a pocket full of like
[02:47:24] you know two paper clips and as wallet that he found and we're good so awesome to have him
[02:47:34] on here for sure we were talking about exploration that's the name of his new book the art of
[02:47:40] exploration echo seems like exploration topic of the day can you recommend some ways we can
[02:47:49] explore getting better as humans for sure what he got so I think keeping ourselves capable
[02:47:59] good call really you know look we have a path the path is hard not all the time but it can be
[02:48:06] hard so I'm saying everyone's not a while we can deviate from that path but the best way to deviate
[02:48:11] from the path is when we explore if we explore as long as it's in the right direction don't slip off
[02:48:17] the path. I'm gonna go backwards keep moving forward anyway so while we're doing that we are improving
[02:48:25] ourselves we are working out there's certain fundamentals to the path we'll say for sure working out
[02:48:30] physical improvement capability strength the more I'd learn about strength and strength training
[02:48:39] or is this in training you know this kind of stuff the more benefits start to reveal themselves
[02:48:44] yep did you know strength training resistance training is the best thing for your cognitive
[02:48:52] capacity as you grow older yes yeah I did did I say that last time you did I remembered it why
[02:48:58] as I was out and for your immune system so you either like I think you hold vitamin D
[02:49:05] more efficiently or yes something with vitamin D where you can check you know anyway so
[02:49:11] stand the path in that way anyway through this path you might need supplementation yes all right
[02:49:16] chocolate supplements only the best kind by the way yeah you probably need unless you are just
[02:49:24] dedicating 24 hours a day for meal prep and you have your spare out shopping you're out harvesting
[02:49:31] your own meat you're out you're out in the garden pulling up carrots you know if that's what you're
[02:49:37] doing you can probably get away without supplementation look we we know that we don't we want to
[02:49:42] eat clean right if you're eating clean you don't need it the chances that are pretty small
[02:49:47] yeah very pretty small and again and there's a bigger picture going on as well and woo
[02:49:54] I have a huge advocate of garden I have a small little mini-chur garden not many things in there
[02:49:58] that's a tomato is in there either way it's not about my garden it's about efficiency
[02:50:03] apparently it is about good what kind of a little couple of rad it was just some tomatoes nonetheless
[02:50:12] you know if you if gardening is your thing then cool but for a lot of us if you dedicate all these hours
[02:50:19] daily weekly whatever meal prep or whatever it might become a little inefficient so supplementation
[02:50:26] might be kind of the jam as far as efficiency goes so good news supplementation for you very good news
[02:50:32] so what we got stuff for your joints stuff for protein stuff for cognitive health stuff for general health
[02:50:39] vitamin D3 joint warfare super cool got some more conditional protein called war
[02:50:47] cold war immunity
[02:50:50] that immunity sure all these things on jockel fuel the same punk milk yeah protein in the form of a
[02:50:59] dessert I authorized the next flavor of milk what is it one it's gonna be that banana cream oh yeah
[02:51:08] yeah no name yet no name yet look and it's hard to take banana cream and turn that into something
[02:51:14] tactical right so if anybody's got some ideas on banana cream like my my years are open yeah
[02:51:20] I'm ready for something cool you know about banana cream that's not what you got that's
[02:51:26] interesting because that's not like an obvious flavor but once you say you're like oh yeah that's
[02:51:32] a legitimate flavor yeah even okay so the pumpkin spice in my opinion this is just my opinion
[02:51:37] because kind of an obvious flavor in obvious flavor yes but and I'm like not that into it fine
[02:51:44] if that's my last flavor one would do not drink it no probably not but
[02:51:49] if when it comes to banana because I don't like pumpkin pie you know how certain people like
[02:51:53] really love pumpkin pie and that's it no but monopo I don't know anybody like that yeah I don't
[02:51:59] couple people really yes but are you sure bro are you exaggerating I think you know someone
[02:52:05] that old beats pumpkin pie it is not for your five you they won't eat keep high put it that's
[02:52:09] where you're at right okay so if I'm not mistaken I exaggerated a little bit but you know what I mean
[02:52:14] it's fine say that because there's not one single person on the planet that only eats just pumpkin
[02:52:22] by one hundred percent when the other prizes yes that yes or a pilgrim's pilgrims eat pumpkin pie that's
[02:52:28] all oh yeah I think they eat apple pie yeah they do anyway so cool the point is banana cream pie
[02:52:36] that is a legitimate one where it's like hey banana cream pie and then there's like everything else
[02:52:41] hmm I'm one of those people but dad's one of those people there you go be seated in a game in the
[02:52:46] game fully so banana cream milk like that's that's that's good no good flavor we also got the
[02:52:55] drinks I'm drinking one right now I check a lot of these drinks this one go in a can you can get it
[02:53:02] you can get it out wall wall if you're on the east coast and for a little while they were
[02:53:07] there was a little break pumping going on because the logistics train look logistics wins wars
[02:53:13] it took me a little bit of time to get that logistics train right now there's a hate can you pump
[02:53:17] the brakes a little bit guess what logistics train is a moving out of the tracks rolling the
[02:53:24] wall wall roll into wall wall clear out the shelves they didn't want me saying that for a little while

[02:54:16] it's a thing with us that's what I'm saying it's not a thing with anybody else I'm saying
[02:54:20] it actually there's no one else that said you know what oh we want our we want our energy drink
[02:54:24] to be healthy so we are going to go to the end degree and paste your eyes it so we don't have to put
[02:54:30] any chemicals in it yeah that's where we went who else is with us there oh look around you know
[02:54:34] who I see nobody yeah and you know it's not a thing it's a thing for us there's what I'm saying
[02:54:39] it is now so what and you're talking even from like a banking standpoint where it's like yeah
[02:54:43] we're not going to do that we're not going to do it we're just going to obviously good but as a human
[02:54:47] being I don't now I don't have to go hey I need some energy I'm going to pay the price a little bit
[02:54:54] but I need that energy right now say hey let's pay that price you know there's no sacrifice no
[02:54:59] sacrifice well pound it energy drink I don't I don't even need energy right now I just want
[02:55:03] to drink that energy drink and guess what I'm going to be more healthy afterwards
[02:55:08] when it comes down to it I'm going to be more healthy and I got my energy drink you done good
[02:55:14] you made up for your pumpkin pie station also at origin USA you can get American made
[02:55:23] stuff when I say stuff I mean jeans American made denim kind of a big deal it's a real big deal
[02:55:29] because you're probably thinking oh I you know I'm I'm supporting America I got these iconic
[02:55:34] American jeans and then you find out that your iconic American jeans are made in China
[02:55:39] yeah which is bad yeah get your American get your iconic American jeans made in America
[02:55:46] yeah it's kind of own in America sewn in America you're eight like a food or something
[02:55:53] and it says all natural then you find out wait it's not all natural though like I guess it's
[02:56:00] like they play all natural cheese puffs right come on bra it's like they play you you know
[02:56:05] the words like it's all natural given the fact that it's not all natural you seem saying
[02:56:10] it's almost like that where it's like yeah these iconic American jeans oh yeah
[02:56:16] right and yeah maybe they're like so it just depends on what you mean by all it depends on
[02:56:20] what you mean by natural depends on what you mean by iconic and it depends on what you mean by
[02:56:24] American but you're not playing that game over here origin USA or it USA is in the name
[02:56:31] there's no plan words there's nothing like that no trickery made no without compromise jeans boots
[02:56:39] rash guards t-shirts what what else you want yeah we got it yeah these I think it's a rash
[02:56:47] guards but yeah all good it's all including you think you're a retribution inclusive yes
[02:56:52] inclusive of the geese gee no gee we're with you very much so it's a for both also jocco is a door

[02:58:28] situation yeah at least don't put yourself in that situation yeah it's true maintain control yeah
[02:58:37] invest upfront so you can relax later that's why you leave a little bit early you leave a little bit
[02:58:44] early like like I was supposed to meet you here today right I left a little bit early why did I do that

[03:00:22] about missing any any designs or anything like that you can subscribe to this podcast there's a
[03:00:28] bunch of different places where it's hosted we also have jockel and ravling which I've been
[03:00:33] recording with Darrell Cooper we're going deep into some crazy subjects unraveling history and
[03:00:40] seen where how we got where we're at we have the grounded podcast we have the warrior kid podcast
[03:00:45] we also the the underground jockel underground dot com we're doing we're recording a little podcast
[03:00:53] there the reason that we're doing that is so that we don't have to have sponsors
[03:01:00] because why because we don't want sponsors because then they dictate what we can and can't do
[03:01:05] which we don't like we also don't want to have the platforms themselves be able to dictate what we can
[03:01:09] and cannot do now look we the platforms been good to us so far everyone's been okay with what we're
[03:01:15] doing that's fine what happens when they're not what happens when they decide they're just going
[03:01:20] to take a sort of injecting advertisements onto our podcast and when I say all I mean everyone
[03:01:26] all of our suit what do we do then we don't have control so we made we made the jockel underground
[03:01:35] podcast jockel underground dot com across a dollars and eighteen cents a month great way to support
[03:01:40] what we're doing if you can't look if you can't afford it we're look we are a podcast of the people
[03:01:47] that's why this podcast is free that's why this podcast doesn't have advertising other than
[03:01:52] what we're doing right now what you could have turned off 48 minutes ago before echo even started talking
[03:01:59] but if you can't afford it that's cool email assistance ad jockel underground dot com
[03:02:03] we'll still hook you up that's what we're here for we have a youtube channel where echo post videos
[03:02:08] and you can subscribe to that one also origin USA has a YouTube channel is that what it's called
[03:02:17] origin USA has a youtube channel yet technically at the end of the day but it's like a series you
[03:02:22] know like you know a youtube channel but it's a super general thing but there's just like a series
[03:02:29] you know that's an origin HD rads a series yeah that's what that's what you're talking about right
[03:02:34] yeah because origin HD is on the youtube channel of origin or in USA yeah well and echo makes a lot of
[03:02:41] those videos and the ones that are really good are usually the ones on the system directorals
[03:02:46] uh psychological warfare yeah to double tracks you know you need jockel to help you
[03:02:53] get past the moment a week this you're like kind of like a therapist in a way or what you call
[03:02:57] like a life coach yeah it's a life coach your life coach because you don't like a coach with a baseball
[03:03:02] bat essentially know the life coach is the the what you call the classic with a stereotypical
[03:03:09] situation is like hey I'm about to I don't you know I just quit smoking and it's like I feel
[03:03:14] like really feel like smoking it's really like you know on my mind to call your life coach and they
[03:03:20] tell you gently like why you shouldn't smoke or give you a turn so far and all this stuff so
[03:03:26] jocquads is on version of that which is called psychological warfare so it's recorded what you
[03:03:30] do is you get it's now but with tracks or jocquatels you hate don't skip that workout you've come
[03:03:35] this far you can do it it's kind of you need to make one of these that was very motivated by that
[03:03:42] jocquads in his way we'll just say also we got folks I can't have a foot type canvas dot
