00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.78
This is Jocco podcast number 200. With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:06.78 --> 00:00:08.78
I'm good evening.

3
00:00:10.78 --> 00:00:17.68
In the morning, after my swim, I sit down and have a cup of coffee and think,

4
00:00:17.68 --> 00:00:21.66
Jim, you're the luckiest guy in the world.

5
00:00:21.66 --> 00:00:32.66
And that is a quote from a man named James Sersley, a man who served his country.

6
00:00:33.94 --> 00:00:40.50
That's a soldier in the US Army. So he volunteered for the Army and then volunteered

7
00:00:40.74 --> 00:00:50.06
to go fight and Vietnam, a man who made incredible sacrifices and who faced incredible

8
00:00:50.06 --> 00:01:06.14
challenges. Challenges that would overwhelm most people. And yet he carried on. And he proved

9
00:01:06.14 --> 00:01:20.38
and is still proving that the human will is stronger than many of us ever realized. And

10
00:01:20.38 --> 00:01:32.78
if you have the right attitude, you can look at a harrowing situation and still call it

11
00:01:32.78 --> 00:01:41.02
lucky. And it is an honor to have this man with us tonight to talk about his experiences

12
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:49.66
and how he has overcome so much adversity. Mr. James Sersley, welcome to the show.

13
00:01:50.22 --> 00:01:56.78
Thank you. Great to be here. Jocco. Sir, honor to have you on. And I apologize that the fact

14
00:01:56.78 --> 00:02:01.90
that you had to travel all the way out here from Sunny Florida to Sunny San Diego, but I'm

15
00:02:01.90 --> 00:02:05.98
honored that you were able to make the trip. I'm honored to be here again. Thanks for asking.

16
00:02:05.98 --> 00:02:12.62
And I like to start at the beginning about, you know, just where you came from, where you grew

17
00:02:12.62 --> 00:02:17.90
up. And I think we're talking about Minnesota, right? We are. You somehow you cover up that

18
00:02:17.90 --> 00:02:23.66
accent pretty well. Well, I've been living in Florida since 1971, so I hope I get rid of some of

19
00:02:23.66 --> 00:02:28.46
that. So you grew up, what kind of was the family situation growing up? What's your, what

20
00:02:28.46 --> 00:02:32.94
did you dad do and whatnot? My dad was a barber in Rochester, Minnesota, and my mother for the

21
00:02:32.94 --> 00:02:39.18
most part was a mother in a housewife and worked a little bit apart time when I got into my teenage

22
00:02:39.18 --> 00:02:45.82
years, along with my older sister was also a couple years older than me. And what's Rochester,

23
00:02:45.82 --> 00:02:51.34
Minnesota like? Well, Rochester, Minnesota is home of the Mayo Clinic. So I mean, it's probably

24
00:02:51.34 --> 00:02:58.78
that's the biggest thing in town and IBM, but it's rural, south eastern corner in Minnesota. Just

25
00:02:58.78 --> 00:03:05.66
great, bunch of patriotic Americans is what I was accustomed to growing up. And your dad served,

26
00:03:05.66 --> 00:03:11.50
if I'm correct, your dad served in the Army Air Corps? He did. He was a radio operator on B-17s

27
00:03:11.50 --> 00:03:17.90
and B-24s during World War II. Now, how much did he talk about that when you grow it up?

28
00:03:17.90 --> 00:03:21.90
You know, not really a whole lot. I think the biggest thing that I experienced with him was he

29
00:03:21.90 --> 00:03:27.66
had a foot locker that he brought back home, and I can remember probably as a nine or 10 year old kid

30
00:03:27.66 --> 00:03:32.94
trying to put on that stuff and have the jacket drape all over me and the pants too big and huge

31
00:03:32.94 --> 00:03:37.58
boots and everything else. But he never really said too much about another than, you know,

32
00:03:37.58 --> 00:03:41.74
where he experienced training in different parts of the United States and that type of thing.

33
00:03:41.74 --> 00:03:50.22
But he was a B-17 radio operator and B-24s. And B-20s. So was he doing the missions into Europe?

34
00:03:50.22 --> 00:03:55.42
He did not do it in, in, never left the United States. Okay. Because when he, when he finished

35
00:03:55.42 --> 00:04:01.74
whatever training he had, they made him a trainer of other radio operators. He got it. So he was lucky.

36
00:04:01.74 --> 00:04:04.86
Well, yeah, otherwise there's a good chance you wouldn't even be here exactly.

37
00:04:05.98 --> 00:04:09.58
Yeah, those are the, those are the guys that we're doing. If you did 25 missions,

38
00:04:09.58 --> 00:04:13.50
you got to go home. But there wasn't too many people that got to go home.

39
00:04:16.06 --> 00:04:22.62
So when you were growing up, I mean, going to high school, what was it? What was your, what were you into?

40
00:04:22.62 --> 00:04:30.30
Growing up? Football, basketball, and based in girls. And that's your which one was the greatest priority.

41
00:04:31.90 --> 00:04:37.98
And were you any good? I mean, I was starting full back on a football team for three different,

42
00:04:37.98 --> 00:04:42.78
you know, sophomore junior and senior year. And probably go to go into college. But I wasn't

43
00:04:42.78 --> 00:04:48.62
exactly the greatest student in the world. So I did make myself eligible to go on to college.

44
00:04:48.62 --> 00:04:53.10
You were focused on studying female anatomy at this point instead of.

45
00:04:53.10 --> 00:04:59.58
That would be a good interpretation. So, so were you planning to go to college?

46
00:04:59.58 --> 00:05:01.74
Were you thinking about going to college? Were your parents,

47
00:05:01.74 --> 00:05:08.94
edge and you towards college? My parents really never said too much about that. My older sister

48
00:05:08.94 --> 00:05:15.50
was already two years into college at that point. My thing was if there had been a place where I could

49
00:05:15.50 --> 00:05:20.54
have gone to play football, but I didn't have to go to school. I'd have been the first one in line

50
00:05:20.54 --> 00:05:29.58
for that location. Yeah. And as I got closer to, you know, finish school in May of 1966,

51
00:05:29.58 --> 00:05:34.70
and as they got into September 66, I kind of thought about it. And I said, you know what I might

52
00:05:34.70 --> 00:05:41.02
do is I might just join the military. Do three years in the army come back home, use the GI

53
00:05:41.02 --> 00:05:46.38
bill and go to school wherever I wanted to. Because I knew the army would get me a GED just about

54
00:05:46.38 --> 00:05:52.22
us quick as I got in there. So that was kind of some of my thoughts when I, as they got ready to join

55
00:05:52.22 --> 00:05:57.74
the military. So what year were you set to graduate from high school? Is that 1967 or no?

56
00:05:57.74 --> 00:06:02.94
No, 1966. So May of 1966. So may of 1966 you started saying yourself, all right, when I get done,

57
00:06:02.94 --> 00:06:08.62
I'll just, I'll just join the army. Well, and I don't know if I even really did that. I mean,

58
00:06:08.62 --> 00:06:13.58
it's, it's probably been more simple than that. I don't know whether I was a forward enough

59
00:06:13.58 --> 00:06:20.30
thinker to actually be in that direction. I actually drove by the post office in downtown Rochester,

60
00:06:20.30 --> 00:06:26.06
Minnesota. There's one of those signs that were on a spring in a head uncle Sam, red, white,

61
00:06:26.06 --> 00:06:31.50
and blue and the big top hat. And his finger was pointed right at the windshield of my car.

62
00:06:31.50 --> 00:06:38.38
And it said uncle Sam needs you. And I circled the block when in and talk to the army recruiter,

63
00:06:38.38 --> 00:06:44.70
not really within a great intentions of joining, but just to kind of see what, what that process

64
00:06:44.70 --> 00:06:50.38
was all about. And what maybe I could do if I did join the army. When that recruiter saw you

65
00:06:50.38 --> 00:06:54.86
come through the door, he was thinking something completely different. He said, I got this guy.

66
00:06:54.86 --> 00:07:00.22
Well, yeah, they were probably tremendously in need of warm bodies at that point in time during the

67
00:07:00.22 --> 00:07:09.26
Vietnam era. So, so this is 1966. So how much were you aware of what was going on in Vietnam?

68
00:07:09.26 --> 00:07:14.62
At this time, how much were you watching the news? How much were you seeing as far as as far as

69
00:07:14.62 --> 00:07:22.38
the Vietnam War goes? Because it had definitely escalated by 1966. I mean, I had one of my friends

70
00:07:22.38 --> 00:07:31.10
who was a pilot in Vietnam, but he was in the Naval Academy. In 1965, they said they didn't even

71
00:07:31.10 --> 00:07:37.02
talk about Vietnam at the Naval Academy at all. It wasn't until they got close to the end of the

72
00:07:37.02 --> 00:07:43.42
senior year that they started going, oh, there's a war going on. But by 1966, it had absolutely escalated.

73
00:07:43.42 --> 00:07:47.50
And so what were your thoughts were you thinking, hey, this is if I go in,

74
00:07:48.30 --> 00:07:50.46
then I know what's going to happen. I know them to be going to war.

75
00:07:50.46 --> 00:07:56.46
I mean, there was some discussion with fellow classmates, and I went to a Perlky school,

76
00:07:56.46 --> 00:08:01.10
and there was a bigger public school that was there in town. And a lot of those guys were talking

77
00:08:01.10 --> 00:08:06.06
about, let's all go in on the buddy system, whether the Marine Corps, the Army, or something.

78
00:08:06.06 --> 00:08:09.82
And I didn't want to have anything to do with that. I mean, that was my answer to everybody

79
00:08:09.82 --> 00:08:15.82
that ever raised that proposition. But we were aware of what was going on and probably she'd pass

80
00:08:15.82 --> 00:08:20.30
through the living room, your parents had had the television on. You'd see it on the six o'clock

81
00:08:20.30 --> 00:08:25.58
with the 10 o'clock news. So you knew the respectivity going on, but it wasn't like it didn't

82
00:08:25.58 --> 00:08:30.46
scare me, but it also wasn't attracted to send me down to the Army recruiters.

83
00:08:31.10 --> 00:08:36.94
So after that first visit to the Army recruiter after you after Uncle Sam called you out as you drove

84
00:08:36.94 --> 00:08:43.58
down the street at what point. So you go to see him and how much longer was it before you sign

85
00:08:43.58 --> 00:08:48.62
the dotted line? Well, I went home and talked to my parents about it and it's kind of one of

86
00:08:48.62 --> 00:08:54.54
those things where I think they probably really focused on the news much more than I ever did.

87
00:08:54.54 --> 00:08:59.02
And I mean, the first thing that I mentioned about the possibility during the Army,

88
00:08:59.02 --> 00:09:04.78
my mother was in tears. I'm sure because of what you see on television. My dad having been

89
00:09:04.78 --> 00:09:09.74
former member of the military was not quite that way, but just said, hey, you know,

90
00:09:09.74 --> 00:09:13.82
there's the Navy, there's the Air Force, there's a lot of different possibilities. What

91
00:09:13.82 --> 00:09:19.34
did she give that some thought? And I just kind of told them if I did join what I thought I

92
00:09:19.34 --> 00:09:25.26
would want to do and that was to be like a mechanic that was something that I enjoyed doing on

93
00:09:25.26 --> 00:09:31.90
my own vehicles and motorcycles that we had. So I mean, I never thought about joining to be a combat

94
00:09:31.90 --> 00:09:39.18
soldier. And again, I probably gave myself about two weeks, had a little bit more discussion with my

95
00:09:39.18 --> 00:09:44.62
parents and that's probably when I decided to go down and join. Again, I was 18 years old, so it wasn't

96
00:09:44.62 --> 00:09:49.66
wasn't like I needed permission to join. I could have done it on my own. And that's basically what I did.

97
00:09:49.66 --> 00:09:55.34
So did you, you were in the cars then? Did you have your own car? I did. Did you have multiple cars?

98
00:09:55.34 --> 00:09:57.98
At two cars in a motorcycle? And what were they?

99
00:09:58.70 --> 00:10:04.46
A 1957 Chevy, a 1964 Chevy and a Yamaha 250 motorcycle?

100
00:10:04.46 --> 00:10:11.58
So you're at your girls that I mentioned girls? You did a little bit, yes.

101
00:10:13.18 --> 00:10:19.98
And nothing about the Navy, the Marine Corps, did they give you a contract in the Army where you

102
00:10:19.98 --> 00:10:22.70
were going to become a mechanic? Did they do that back then? They did.

103
00:10:23.42 --> 00:10:28.06
Okay, so you knew right away, hey, you're going to go in, when to make you a mechanic,

104
00:10:28.06 --> 00:10:33.74
and that sounds like a pretty good plan. Especially because I'm just thinking like when I

105
00:10:33.74 --> 00:10:41.10
joined the Navy, all other prospects in life didn't seem as cool as that. They didn't seem,

106
00:10:41.10 --> 00:10:45.26
you know, when you said you wish there was a place where you could just go and play football,

107
00:10:45.90 --> 00:10:50.94
well, I wanted a place where I could just go and play a commandil. And there was a place like that.

108
00:10:50.94 --> 00:10:56.30
It was called the Navy. And that's how I ended up joining. And it seems like, yeah, I don't know,

109
00:10:56.30 --> 00:11:00.14
I'm not saying I didn't have any other options, but it just seemed like such a good option for me.

110
00:11:00.14 --> 00:11:04.86
It's so simple and straightforward. And that's actually one of the things that I liked about the

111
00:11:04.86 --> 00:11:11.26
Navy was when I joined. Nothing else, none of my previous life mattered. It was just here you go.

112
00:11:11.26 --> 00:11:18.78
Here's what you have to do. So, so, did your mind shift at all about your decision when you

113
00:11:18.78 --> 00:11:25.58
showed up to boot camp? No, okay. And I think really because, you know, when I reflect on that now

114
00:11:25.58 --> 00:11:30.86
and look back, that there was a lot of guys who'd never left their home town, never done anything,

115
00:11:30.86 --> 00:11:35.18
when they got drafted and, and I don't know, what 40% of the people in my basic training,

116
00:11:35.18 --> 00:11:39.90
and it were probably drafted. Didn't want to be there and never had any intentions of being the military.

117
00:11:40.62 --> 00:11:45.26
It also scared the living crap out of them. I mean, the people that cried

118
00:11:45.90 --> 00:11:51.18
half the night all night in basic training, you know, they were away from home for the first time.

119
00:11:51.18 --> 00:11:56.62
They weren't physical type of people to start with and it was just extremely difficult to watch a

120
00:11:56.62 --> 00:12:02.46
lot of that while I went through basic training. So, where did you go to basic training?

121
00:12:02.46 --> 00:12:08.46
Fort Polk Louise and Anna. Now, we're most of the kids that you went through boot camp with.

122
00:12:08.46 --> 00:12:12.70
Did they send them where they kids that were from that area? Did you go to boot camp

123
00:12:12.70 --> 00:12:17.10
like regionally or was it people from all over the country? People from all over the country.

124
00:12:17.10 --> 00:12:21.66
I think you're induction and where you go for basic training in the army at that time,

125
00:12:21.66 --> 00:12:25.90
dependent on the timing of when you got drafted or when you joined.

126
00:12:25.90 --> 00:12:30.22
Could have been to Fort Stewart, Georgia. Think there were places out here in California where they

127
00:12:30.22 --> 00:12:36.70
actually had basic, Fort Lewis Washington had basic all over the place. Fort Dixon, New Jersey.

128
00:12:36.70 --> 00:12:40.78
So, you're in there with people that have been drafted. You said 40%.

129
00:12:40.78 --> 00:12:47.02
I think roughly at that time. And there's, I mean, this is where people start doing crazy

130
00:12:47.02 --> 00:12:52.30
things just to get out, like, you know, wet their bed or whatever sleepwalk and all this kind of

131
00:12:52.30 --> 00:12:56.38
things so they just would get out of their service. Did you see that kind of thing?

132
00:12:56.38 --> 00:13:03.18
We had three guys that actually went AWOL and stayed underneath one of those elevated

133
00:13:03.18 --> 00:13:08.38
wood frame World War II barracks for three days because even if they had got out from

134
00:13:08.38 --> 00:13:13.18
underneath the barracks, they wouldn't have known how to get out of Louisiana to get back where

135
00:13:13.18 --> 00:13:19.50
they were from. So people brought them food for three days and then they finally decided to surrender.

136
00:13:21.26 --> 00:13:25.50
And that's the other the interesting thing about. So this is 1960. This is still 1966.

137
00:13:26.62 --> 00:13:32.70
And so the anti-war movement wasn't in full swing yet. Was it as far as just

138
00:13:33.18 --> 00:13:37.18
open hippies in the streets and those kind of things? That wasn't really happening.

139
00:13:37.18 --> 00:13:43.42
And 66. Was it? No more like 68 and 69 is when it really got cranked up. So these kids that were coming

140
00:13:43.42 --> 00:13:49.34
in, they were just horrified about what was going to happen. And I don't know whether it was even

141
00:13:49.34 --> 00:13:54.54
a fear of going to Vietnam. If it was just a fear of being away from home, the physicality of

142
00:13:55.10 --> 00:14:00.14
of basic training and people screaming and hollering in your face and everything else. I mean,

143
00:14:00.14 --> 00:14:04.38
I think that's what scared of more than anything else. You know, that's one thing that

144
00:14:04.38 --> 00:14:10.46
they can never put back in the bottle is these days. Well, first of all, it's all volunteer.

145
00:14:10.46 --> 00:14:17.82
But second of all, we've seen when I joined the Navy, I had seen, you know, military bootcamp movies

146
00:14:17.82 --> 00:14:23.82
since I was born. I mean, we just knew every little trick and anticipated everything that was

147
00:14:23.82 --> 00:14:31.02
going to happen. And it seems like if you were a kid from wherever and you got drafted and you'd

148
00:14:31.02 --> 00:14:36.14
never left home and then you show up and you got some drill sergeant going nuts at your face.

149
00:14:36.14 --> 00:14:42.94
Yeah, that's totally different. That's a shock to the system.

150
00:14:44.30 --> 00:14:49.42
And that was before you could play that card, I guess, that they use now. You know, there's a time

151
00:14:49.42 --> 00:14:55.18
out card in a lot of different branches of the military where you can go for and make a phone call

152
00:14:55.18 --> 00:15:00.06
and call your congressman if you want. If you're being mistreated, you can call home and report it.

153
00:15:00.06 --> 00:15:04.70
Well, they used to say over there, we'll take you to the phone booth, but I'm not sure you'll ever

154
00:15:04.70 --> 00:15:13.02
make it back to the unit. So, but you were, you were an athlete, you were a three-sport athlete,

155
00:15:13.02 --> 00:15:20.06
you were used to working and so it wasn't a big deal for you to go through and you

156
00:15:20.06 --> 00:15:25.26
and you volunteered to do it. Right. So you get done with bootcamp and then what's next, you

157
00:15:25.26 --> 00:15:29.98
must have to go some kind of MOS school to learn your trade, right? I stayed at Fort Book,

158
00:15:29.98 --> 00:15:37.82
Louisiana for wheeled vehicle repair school. And that was another, I think, eight weeks or seven weeks.

159
00:15:38.54 --> 00:15:43.26
And then after that, they decided I was a pretty good mechanic. So they sent me to Fort

160
00:15:43.26 --> 00:15:49.50
Hill, Oklahoma for track vehicle repair school, which was everything that the Army owned that had a track

161
00:15:49.50 --> 00:15:55.98
on it, you know, self-propelled howitzers and armored personnel, carers, tanks, you name it, anything

162
00:15:55.98 --> 00:16:04.38
that had a track on it. Did you enjoy all that? I did. Like I have a nephew that he's just loves

163
00:16:04.38 --> 00:16:10.54
all kinds of big machinery, you know, he just anything that any caterpillar, any big piece of machinery

164
00:16:10.54 --> 00:16:16.94
he just loves it. And I could see him joining the Army to be a tank repairman. And then so how long

165
00:16:16.94 --> 00:16:24.86
is that school last? Another eight weeks. And at this point, are you, I mean, with the war going on,

166
00:16:24.86 --> 00:16:31.50
are you starting to be more aware of possibilities of where you could end up? Well, you would hear

167
00:16:31.50 --> 00:16:36.86
people talking about it. And some of the people that I took the track vehicle school with were people

168
00:16:36.86 --> 00:16:42.06
that had been in the military for a year, year and a half, two years, Robert E. Five, or some of

169
00:16:42.06 --> 00:16:47.74
them actually even E. Six, who had had the wheel part of it, but never the track part. And I think

170
00:16:47.74 --> 00:16:53.82
they were kind of merging those two M. O. S. So that's why they were training in both, both categories.

171
00:16:53.82 --> 00:16:58.22
Did you have any guys in those schools that had already been to Vietnam? We did not, not

172
00:16:58.22 --> 00:17:03.82
any of those schools, but I did. My first assignment was to the 24th Infantry Division in Germany,

173
00:17:03.82 --> 00:17:08.78
and there were Vietnam veterans in our unit in Germany. So you wrap up your school and that's your first

174
00:17:08.78 --> 00:17:17.10
your first permanent duty is over in Germany. And you show up there, which has got to be a good time.

175
00:17:17.10 --> 00:17:24.14
I mean, it's pretty nice. So are we in the 67 yet? Yep, we're in 67. So 1967, how old are you?

176
00:17:25.34 --> 00:17:28.62
19 19 years old, and you get stationed in Weren, Germany?

177
00:17:28.62 --> 00:17:34.30
Oh, it's good. Did you, did you drink any beer while you were there? A little bit.

178
00:17:37.10 --> 00:17:41.82
I think everything right outside the gate, just like the military bases here in in this country,

179
00:17:41.82 --> 00:17:49.50
all the pubs are right outside the gate. And your 19 years old, you got more, you're the richest

180
00:17:49.50 --> 00:17:53.34
human being in the world, because you got that. What are you to E3?

181
00:17:53.34 --> 00:18:01.66
$97 a month is what it paid when I joined here. I quit $150 a week job to get $97 a month,

182
00:18:01.66 --> 00:18:06.46
but I got all the closing free food I wanted. Yeah, I was looking at one of my

183
00:18:06.46 --> 00:18:11.42
paystubs the other day when I first joined the Navy, and it was, I want to say it was like $700,

184
00:18:11.42 --> 00:18:17.34
a month or $642 a month, and I was looking at it going dang. They really, they got me pretty good

185
00:18:17.34 --> 00:18:25.50
in the day for a month. But you're in Germany, and what's your job there? I mean, you're working

186
00:18:25.50 --> 00:18:29.74
on tracks like you were supposed to. That's what you're doing. Well, I did a little bit of that,

187
00:18:29.74 --> 00:18:34.30
and what the assignment of do was run the TI-based technical inspection on all the vehicles,

188
00:18:34.30 --> 00:18:38.70
you know, you know, having been around the military, every vehicle, I step a logbook,

189
00:18:38.70 --> 00:18:44.22
all the logbooks have to be up to date with repairs and maintenance on them. So my job was to

190
00:18:45.02 --> 00:18:49.42
sort of fair it out. What needed to be done, making sure the driver took care of it, and if not,

191
00:18:49.42 --> 00:18:53.98
then we sent the rest over with a work order over to the regular mechanics, and they replaced

192
00:18:53.98 --> 00:18:59.42
or fixed something that was damaged at that point. Now, are you doing any time in the field at this point?

193
00:18:59.42 --> 00:19:04.86
We used to go to Graffin, Vera, Holon, Felt's, Wild Fleckin, and do training out that way.

194
00:19:04.86 --> 00:19:11.26
So you'd go out and do a big exercise, and when you do those exercises, would you be a,

195
00:19:11.26 --> 00:19:16.46
would you be one of the crew on any of the tracks, or would you be standing by to repair them?

196
00:19:16.46 --> 00:19:22.30
Only standing by to repair them, because the motor pool was battalion, motor pool, and it was big enough

197
00:19:22.30 --> 00:19:32.46
that you had the full contingent of mechanics, welders, and everything else. And then how long did you

198
00:19:32.46 --> 00:19:39.02
spend in Germany? I spent about eight months in Germany before a volunteer to go to Vietnam.

199
00:19:39.82 --> 00:19:47.18
Now, at this point, you said you did have guys that had been in Vietnam, and they were with you,

200
00:19:47.18 --> 00:19:52.06
and what were they? What was the feedback they were giving you? Well, I mean, they were negative about it.

201
00:19:52.06 --> 00:19:56.94
They weren't trying to make it overly scary. I think they were realistic and honest about it.

202
00:19:56.94 --> 00:20:02.54
But I think one of the things that when I look back at that now, they were okay, and they were alive.

203
00:20:03.50 --> 00:20:09.82
So, you know, maybe it's really not that bad. Yeah. But I mean, if it had been somebody that had been

204
00:20:09.82 --> 00:20:15.42
seriously injured, maybe going, maybe I need to think about this a little bit more. Yeah.

205
00:20:15.42 --> 00:20:21.66
I mean, I was kind of determined to go in the reason that I was, because I felt like when I was

206
00:20:21.66 --> 00:20:31.10
in Germany, I felt like I had a civilian job with a green uniform. I didn't figure I was being

207
00:20:31.10 --> 00:20:39.74
utilized or I was using myself to the best of my ability. I joined because I wanted to make some kind of

208
00:20:39.74 --> 00:20:45.02
a contribution. You know, what, you know, what in a John Wayne kind of story or anything that big?

209
00:20:45.02 --> 00:20:51.42
But I just didn't feel like I was accomplishing that there in the first surgeon talked to me about

210
00:20:51.42 --> 00:20:54.94
it and said, you know, you need to think about this. I'm going to give you three or four days.

211
00:20:54.94 --> 00:20:59.58
Talk to some of the guys that have been in Vietnam. Because I mean, I think he'd been,

212
00:20:59.58 --> 00:21:03.58
and it wasn't anything you just wanted to rubber stamp and put you on a plane and send you back

213
00:21:03.58 --> 00:21:07.82
and get you ready to go. He was really a genuine kind of person who felt like, hey,

214
00:21:08.46 --> 00:21:12.46
make sure this is what you want before we actually sign the paper work and send you on.

215
00:21:13.42 --> 00:21:18.70
Yeah, there's also different people have different experiences in war. And I know,

216
00:21:18.70 --> 00:21:24.86
in Iraq, there was places in Iraq where the living conditions were better than most than much of

217
00:21:24.86 --> 00:21:31.26
the living conditions that I experienced in my normal life in America. And then you go 10 miles away

218
00:21:31.26 --> 00:21:36.70
or sometimes even three miles from that point and you're outside at some forward operating base.

219
00:21:36.70 --> 00:21:41.74
And it's really dangerous and really hard living conditions. And it just depends on where you are.

220
00:21:41.74 --> 00:21:46.46
And I think the other thing you were just talking about, I think they call it survivors bias,

221
00:21:46.46 --> 00:21:51.34
which is the only people that we get to talk to. Like, it happens with businesses.

222
00:21:51.34 --> 00:21:54.78
You know, someone says, oh, I did this with my business and that's why I'm a multi-millionaire

223
00:21:54.78 --> 00:21:58.78
now and says everyone says, well, that must work. So I'll do it. What you don't get to talk to is all the

224
00:21:58.78 --> 00:22:02.94
people that they tried that and it failed. So yeah, from your perspective, you're here and from

225
00:22:02.94 --> 00:22:07.26
guys that were in Vietnam. And like you said, they, I don't want to say they had a good time, but it

226
00:22:07.26 --> 00:22:13.82
wasn't that bad. Because they were coming back to be able to tell you about it. So you thought about it

227
00:22:13.82 --> 00:22:18.22
for a few days. What were you seeing on the news at this point? You didn't see a much news at all when

228
00:22:18.22 --> 00:22:23.66
I was in Germany. I mean, I don't know whether I ever watched a television all the while I was there.

229
00:22:25.42 --> 00:22:33.10
And were there, were there any like Intel reports, were there casualty reports? Were you seeing?

230
00:22:33.10 --> 00:22:39.18
I got to remember for me and Iraq, I was always paying attention to how many, how many people

231
00:22:39.18 --> 00:22:45.18
were getting killed every month. I mean, I tracked that all time and you'd see those numbers creeping

232
00:22:45.18 --> 00:22:50.30
up and they crept up and they crept up and I paid attention to that. Was that something that

233
00:22:50.30 --> 00:22:57.82
you were looking at thinking, well, hey, that could be me? Never saw any or never heard any reports

234
00:22:57.82 --> 00:23:02.78
of that at all. I mean, I think there were, there was information shared that people were

235
00:23:02.78 --> 00:23:09.02
dying in Vietnam, but there wasn't any statistical paperwork that actually would bear out all those

236
00:23:09.02 --> 00:23:15.74
numbers. So you talked to the first sergeant. He tells you give it a few days. You give it a few

237
00:23:15.74 --> 00:23:23.26
days and you say, yep, I'm still in. I want to go do this. Did you, when you go volunteer, what do they

238
00:23:23.26 --> 00:23:27.10
do? Are they assigning you to a specific unit? Are they just shipping you off to Vietnam and you're

239
00:23:27.10 --> 00:23:33.58
going to sign when you get there? That's what happens. Your replacement troop. So basically, I think

240
00:23:33.58 --> 00:23:40.62
when Vietnam first got started, whole units went to Vietnam. But as time went on, everybody became

241
00:23:40.62 --> 00:23:45.74
a replacement troop. Somebody would rotate out tomorrow. Another guy would come in. Three days later,

242
00:23:45.74 --> 00:23:49.90
another guy would rotate month, you know what I mean? I just went on that way all the while I was in

243
00:23:49.90 --> 00:23:56.14
country. So how long do they give you to prepare? Did you anything different to prepare? You just

244
00:23:56.14 --> 00:24:01.02
how long did it take from the time you said, hey, I want to go, yep, and then how long was it before

245
00:24:01.02 --> 00:24:07.66
you left? It was about two weeks before I actually got orders that came down from Battalion or Brigade.

246
00:24:08.62 --> 00:24:14.30
Went home on a 30-day leave back to Minnesota during the month of February of 1968. And then

247
00:24:14.30 --> 00:24:23.50
I reported to Fort Lewis Washington on the last couple days of February, 68 was in country by March

248
00:24:23.50 --> 00:24:30.70
the first, 68. Did you fly over on civilian aircraft? I did. With studiouss and

249
00:24:30.70 --> 00:24:35.90
threat of airlines, if I remember correctly, which is not even an existence anymore. What was it called?

250
00:24:35.90 --> 00:24:43.98
Brand of brand of airlines. And that was, what about saying goodbye to your parents? Was your

251
00:24:43.98 --> 00:24:48.54
dad nervous with your mom a disaster? She used already sad when you joined the army in the first place.

252
00:24:48.54 --> 00:24:55.18
It was pretty hard on my mom. And I think it was difficult for my dad to, because I'm sure they

253
00:24:55.18 --> 00:25:00.78
probably both thought I was just absolutely crazy for volunteering to go. I mean, I could have stayed in

254
00:25:00.78 --> 00:25:07.34
Germany ran out my three years and got out of the military, but I just couldn't see myself doing that.

255
00:25:07.34 --> 00:25:17.90
So it was difficult for. So civilian flight, you get over there. You know, again talking about movies

256
00:25:17.90 --> 00:25:23.98
and we all see the movies and you know, I watched all those Vietnam War movies growing up and

257
00:25:23.98 --> 00:25:32.46
you, they always have the iconic scenes of the new guys in their fresh camouflage uniforms,

258
00:25:32.46 --> 00:25:38.70
getting off the bird and there's the hardened veterans that are head and home after year a combat

259
00:25:38.70 --> 00:25:44.30
and they look like they've been through year combat. Did you, did you see that? I did.

260
00:25:44.30 --> 00:25:49.90
Yeah, they were actually loading planes on the same location that we were off loading. So just exactly

261
00:25:49.90 --> 00:25:56.30
like you described is what took place. Anybody talked to you about anything? Anybody say anything to you?

262
00:25:56.30 --> 00:26:01.42
Um, I mean, usually they're kind of giving you just a thumbs up and they're great big smile on their

263
00:26:01.42 --> 00:26:06.46
face because they know they're loading the bird and going home. So they're happy to be getting out of

264
00:26:06.46 --> 00:26:10.30
there. And the attitude with the guys that you were with, you know, you already talked about the

265
00:26:10.30 --> 00:26:15.26
draftees and boot camp that are freaking out. Was there any guys now that are heading to Vietnam

266
00:26:15.26 --> 00:26:20.14
and there and some of those guys probably just got out of advancing for chetrini or whatever

267
00:26:20.14 --> 00:26:26.54
the and have been in the army for whatever for months. Yeah, four months and then maybe a

268
00:26:26.54 --> 00:26:31.82
30 day leave at home and on their way to Vietnam. And again, that same kind of situation

269
00:26:32.62 --> 00:26:37.34
and I think they're whether you join the army or you got drafted. I think they're still that

270
00:26:37.34 --> 00:26:43.02
fear even though that's what you signed up for if you enlisted. There's that fear of the unknown

271
00:26:43.42 --> 00:26:48.94
that you've gotten off this plane and what's going to happen next. It's weird because

272
00:26:51.18 --> 00:26:56.22
there's the I think a lot of this your attitude goes a long way because

273
00:26:58.06 --> 00:27:02.94
there's definitely people and times and myself included where I would think there's nothing's

274
00:27:02.94 --> 00:27:07.98
going to happen to me. Like it'll happen to anyone else. I've talked about this before like I always

275
00:27:07.98 --> 00:27:13.50
feel if I'm on a commercial airline and it blows up in the sky that I'm going to live.

276
00:27:13.50 --> 00:27:18.46
I'm going to I'm going to grab a seat cushion or something. I'm going to figure it out.

277
00:27:18.46 --> 00:27:25.02
So there's that kind of stupid ignorance that that I know I had, especially when I was younger,

278
00:27:25.02 --> 00:27:29.34
like nothing was ever going to happen to me. And I would see that in my guys, you know when I was

279
00:27:29.34 --> 00:27:34.38
old, I didn't go to war until I was you know older and I saw some of the guys that you could tell

280
00:27:34.38 --> 00:27:40.22
they didn't think anything was going to happen to them and I had other guys where you would swear

281
00:27:40.22 --> 00:27:47.02
in their mind they had a target on the back of their head every step that they took. And so you get a

282
00:27:47.02 --> 00:27:52.54
drastic difference between people's attitudes. Did you see that between did you see that with

283
00:27:52.54 --> 00:27:57.66
different guys and what did you think yourself? I did see that same thing. I don't think that's

284
00:27:57.66 --> 00:28:04.14
changed any from Vietnam to the generation that served in Iraq or Afghanistan. I think that

285
00:28:04.14 --> 00:28:11.02
mixture in that percentage is probably still the same all the time. Certainly a lot of people who

286
00:28:11.02 --> 00:28:15.90
had a certain Emma West but maybe they had some other kind of a job in the states would say,

287
00:28:15.90 --> 00:28:21.18
well I might be a Levin Bravo which is a grunt but I'm not going to have to do that because I was

288
00:28:21.18 --> 00:28:26.14
the company armor and I'll be I'll be running you know distributing weapons and stuff like that

289
00:28:26.14 --> 00:28:31.26
but you'd see them out in the field some pain later they'd be humpin the bush with the 65 pound

290
00:28:31.26 --> 00:28:38.54
pack on their back. So I mean I think there was a certain fear but a certain courage is well too

291
00:28:38.54 --> 00:28:43.42
that I think most of the people that I ever served with displayed and I think even the guys that

292
00:28:43.42 --> 00:28:50.30
got drafted came to the resolve that you know look at I'm here I met as well make the best of this.

293
00:28:50.30 --> 00:28:55.34
There's no sense of complaining or whining unless just go ahead and get our year ran get my

294
00:28:55.34 --> 00:29:00.22
two years in in the military and get it over with and I can go home. So I mean I've always said that

295
00:29:00.22 --> 00:29:06.70
the people that I served with were tremendously courageous and extremely brave individuals.

296
00:29:06.70 --> 00:29:11.74
I never saw anything that I would ever be afraid to serve alongside of that person.

297
00:29:11.74 --> 00:29:15.66
Yeah that's powerful that's the American that's the American serviceman right there

298
00:29:16.46 --> 00:29:23.34
because even when I was talking about guys that I knew that would and I had friends that would

299
00:29:23.34 --> 00:29:29.90
verbally you know they'd say I don't know feeling good about tonight man they would say that stuff.

300
00:29:29.90 --> 00:29:34.86
Yeah and guess what they'd get on their gear and they'd go out night after night and I actually

301
00:29:34.86 --> 00:29:39.82
have to give them more credit because sometimes I think well I'm not I think I'm going to be fine

302
00:29:39.82 --> 00:29:45.10
but it doesn't take me that much courage to overcome that and here's a guy that has that feeling

303
00:29:45.10 --> 00:29:49.82
night after night but like you said every time night after night they're getting their gear on

304
00:29:49.82 --> 00:29:56.70
they're going out and doing their job. How did you get assigned? So now you show up this is just

305
00:29:56.70 --> 00:30:04.54
this is like this is what the army has the reputation of the big army hey you're a piece

306
00:30:04.54 --> 00:30:08.94
you're a piece you're a you're a cog in the machine you give them your I mean how how

307
00:30:08.94 --> 00:30:15.02
did that process work? Well you get to be an army you do a three day in-country orientation

308
00:30:15.02 --> 00:30:20.78
where they teach you all about snakes and bamboo vipers and all that crazy stuff and whatnot to

309
00:30:20.78 --> 00:30:27.02
do and punchy snakes and all that and then I'm sure that while you're there they're working on

310
00:30:27.02 --> 00:30:32.78
who needs a track vehicle mechanic or who needs infantrymen whichever the case may be and

311
00:30:32.78 --> 00:30:37.90
they just put me on a plane and flew me up to the night or actually to flew me to Tulae on that one

312
00:30:37.90 --> 00:30:42.86
and then helicopter and me to Elzie baldie out in the middle of nowhere and that's how I got to the

313
00:30:42.86 --> 00:30:48.94
unit I served with. Now as you're getting further and further away from civilization did the

314
00:30:48.94 --> 00:30:53.74
hair on the back of your neck start to stand up straighter? Well I'm probably a little bit on the

315
00:30:53.74 --> 00:31:00.38
crazy side and I think the curiosity factor I was okay with you know I mean I'm like you're talking

316
00:31:00.38 --> 00:31:06.30
about I've never felt like I'm not going to say I've never felt fear but I've always just been

317
00:31:06.30 --> 00:31:13.02
excited about what's going to happen next. I never worried when I was in-country about dying that

318
00:31:13.02 --> 00:31:19.02
thought never crossed my mind. I just felt like if I did what I knew to do and use the the

319
00:31:20.06 --> 00:31:24.54
experiences that I had and everything else in a plight of the way you're supposed to I was going to be okay.

320
00:31:25.18 --> 00:31:32.06
So you're rolling into Elzie baldie? Where about some Vietnam was that? That's in the I-Core area

321
00:31:32.06 --> 00:31:39.50
closer up to the DMZ. There's about 17 kilometers southwest of Deney. And so is it a pretty remote location

322
00:31:39.50 --> 00:31:46.14
then? Called the Quasan Valley is our area of operation I mean a lot of the I-Core and that area

323
00:31:46.14 --> 00:31:53.10
especially in 68 and 69. And how big how big was that was the forward operating base that you were

324
00:31:53.10 --> 00:31:58.86
staying? How big was it? Not very big I mean battalion headquarters. So it's all in headquarters.

325
00:31:58.86 --> 00:32:05.82
And then so you check in there you land on your airplane you land on the helicopter. Get out of the

326
00:32:05.82 --> 00:32:16.14
helicopter and then what happens? Well I go to Eptroops company headquarters report to the first sergeant

327
00:32:16.14 --> 00:32:24.14
telling who I am and what I am and the first sergeant called everybody's son. He said son. I told him

328
00:32:24.14 --> 00:32:29.26
I was a track vehicle mechanic and feet point me in the direction the motor pool I'd go report to the

329
00:32:29.26 --> 00:32:36.70
motor sergeant. He said son. We really don't have a motor pool here in Vietnam. He said there is a guy

330
00:32:36.70 --> 00:32:42.06
that runs the maintenance department. He's spec 5 so and so. And he said you can you'll see him

331
00:32:42.06 --> 00:32:49.02
at Chaud a night but you'll be at machine gunner on a 1-1-3-A-1 and we'll make sure you get a toolbox.

332
00:32:49.02 --> 00:32:52.46
So if anything goes wrong while you're out there that's your job to fix them.

333
00:32:52.46 --> 00:33:02.38
So there's the wake up call. The uh you know I fought in the battle our body in 2006 and

334
00:33:03.18 --> 00:33:11.58
you know what vehicle we use for casualty evacuation 113's. Yep the exact same vehicle. So that's

335
00:33:11.58 --> 00:33:17.34
where you got assigned. You got assigned to a 113 which is an armored personnel carrier made out of

336
00:33:17.34 --> 00:33:24.94
aluminum if I'm correct. I'm not sure probably wouldn't be bit surprised though and they're very

337
00:33:24.94 --> 00:33:29.98
they're like they're basically a box with tracks that's basically what they look like exactly.

338
00:33:29.98 --> 00:33:34.94
It is a box with tracks on them. They're not huge and not as big as a tank. How many people you

339
00:33:34.94 --> 00:33:40.78
think they hold maybe? You could probably put 80 or 10 on the inside. Yeah we used to are joke about

340
00:33:40.78 --> 00:33:43.98
armored personnel carriers. What's how many people can you fit into them one more?

341
00:33:43.98 --> 00:33:51.02
Uh so that's where you get assigned. So now you realize okay there's no motor pool here.

342
00:33:51.02 --> 00:33:56.14
There's no that's not happening. He says you're gonna be a machine gunner on one of these

343
00:33:56.14 --> 00:34:01.58
113's. So you check in who are you checking in with now?

344
00:34:01.58 --> 00:34:07.74
Are you well when when my unit my platoon was out in the field and they came back in for

345
00:34:07.74 --> 00:34:14.14
child that night that's when I was introduced to the L.T. and the platoon sergeant and then I don't know

346
00:34:14.14 --> 00:34:18.46
they just picked a track that was short one guy and that's the one I went to. And how many how many

347
00:34:18.46 --> 00:34:24.86
tracks do you have in your platoon? Nine. Wow that's a pretty big bulltune. Well it's 18m60

348
00:34:24.86 --> 00:34:32.54
machine guns nine 50 caliber and one 106 recoilless rifle so it's a lot of fire. Yeah that's that's

349
00:34:32.54 --> 00:34:39.02
serious business. I didn't think they had that many in one platoon. Then so then okay so now you

350
00:34:39.02 --> 00:34:45.66
settle in and what kind of what kind of missions were you guys doing? Well hey when I originally

351
00:34:45.66 --> 00:34:50.46
got in country they called him search and destroy and then I think somebody in Washington decided

352
00:34:50.46 --> 00:34:56.46
we need to change it to search and clear. It didn't sound quite as disastrous if you called it search

353
00:34:56.46 --> 00:35:01.98
and clear but the mission was exactly the same thing. You still went out, checked all the villages,

354
00:35:01.98 --> 00:35:06.86
checked all the people anybody that was out working in the fields looking for cashes or rice,

355
00:35:06.86 --> 00:35:11.74
looking for weapons that were hidden in different villages, net type of thing. Sometimes you'd have

356
00:35:11.74 --> 00:35:16.86
intelligence reports that would send you somewhere or maybe they had some information that there was

357
00:35:16.86 --> 00:35:23.58
something bad going on. Sometimes it was there sometimes it wasn't. The area of operation that I actually

358
00:35:23.58 --> 00:35:30.30
worked in was exactly the same one. Me lie was in my area of operation. We called it the pink

359
00:35:30.30 --> 00:35:38.06
bill on our map and I think Lieutenant Kelly's thing had happened three weeks or four weeks after I

360
00:35:38.06 --> 00:35:44.30
got in country or something like in third week and March or maybe around the first of April you

361
00:35:44.30 --> 00:35:50.46
you're familiar with that. But you guys did you guys hear anything about it?

362
00:35:51.82 --> 00:35:58.78
I think we heard a little bit about it but communication back then was not the same as it is today.

363
00:35:58.78 --> 00:36:03.18
I mean obviously nobody had cell phones or anything like that. You didn't have pictures or any

364
00:36:03.18 --> 00:36:09.50
information. We just knew there was a lot of people in that village and it was a sizeable village

365
00:36:09.50 --> 00:36:14.46
for as remote as it was. Most of them were just all rice farmers that were out there so all they

366
00:36:14.46 --> 00:36:19.98
do was harvest rice and carry it to market. But we'd been through there a number of different times

367
00:36:19.98 --> 00:36:26.06
before and after the actual meal I massacre. And I think the thing that was interesting about

368
00:36:26.06 --> 00:36:31.74
Vietnam was for villagers. If I used an interpreter to ask somebody a question in a village

369
00:36:31.74 --> 00:36:36.86
about what they rather have the NVA in charge or where they rather have the Americans or the

370
00:36:36.86 --> 00:36:43.42
South Vietnamese military in charge and they were really always reluctant to answer that question

371
00:36:43.42 --> 00:36:50.78
because I don't think there was a good answer they could give me. If they answered at one

372
00:36:50.78 --> 00:36:57.50
way it kind of meant they were Vietnamese NVA sympathizers and if the injured at the other way

373
00:36:57.50 --> 00:37:01.26
then that meant they were totally opposed and they would support us but we know that wasn't the

374
00:37:01.26 --> 00:37:06.86
way it happened either. They were just trying to go rice and stay alive. So I mean if we would leave

375
00:37:06.86 --> 00:37:10.94
them alone and the NVA would leave them alone they'd be the happiest people on the face of the earth

376
00:37:10.94 --> 00:37:16.62
but it didn't happen that way. We didn't abuse them but the NVA abused them all the time not only

377
00:37:16.62 --> 00:37:24.46
for the rice but for shelter and everything else. How what was your opt-empo like and so how long

378
00:37:24.46 --> 00:37:31.66
would you go out on a mission for? I mean probably a standard time is about 20 to 22 days at a time

379
00:37:31.66 --> 00:37:37.90
and then we get re-supplied in the field with shinux for fuel and for water and food and everything.

380
00:37:37.90 --> 00:37:42.30
So this forward operating base that you were out that you were out of when that

381
00:37:42.30 --> 00:37:47.26
potteen came back they'd been out for a long time they'd been out for and on that particular

382
00:37:47.26 --> 00:37:51.74
one I don't know but I would have to guess they probably were at least a two week period of time

383
00:37:51.74 --> 00:37:56.30
once you went out and you started through the area of operation usually didn't come back until

384
00:37:56.30 --> 00:38:02.46
you covered the whole thing. But you guys are living do you have death mounts with you or is

385
00:38:02.46 --> 00:38:09.42
everyone on is everyone in the potoon traveling inside the track and sleeping inside the track

386
00:38:09.42 --> 00:38:16.86
and you got water I mean what's like the daily routine like? Well you get up and fix breakfast

387
00:38:16.86 --> 00:38:23.10
you know fix some coffee or some sea rations and you know easy to carry it because your armored

388
00:38:23.10 --> 00:38:29.74
personnel carriers wait didn't make a lot of different stuff we'd have somebody would fix this

389
00:38:29.74 --> 00:38:33.90
somebody would fix the coffee we'd all kind of share the meal together because you didn't have any

390
00:38:33.90 --> 00:38:40.30
food that came out to the field very often and we just sit down maybe the night before that

391
00:38:40.30 --> 00:38:45.50
morning with the L.T. and go over what the daily operation was and follow up with a myler

392
00:38:45.50 --> 00:38:50.46
cover on the map sheet and a grease pencil and you know go through the checkpoints throughout the

393
00:38:50.46 --> 00:38:57.02
course of the day you know if you faced any any difficulties you you know just faced it had on return

394
00:38:57.02 --> 00:39:03.34
fire called in artillery maybe you'd get a call an infantry unit to be pinned down nice

395
00:39:03.34 --> 00:39:08.22
part of about being armored personnel carriers you could move real fast lay down a lot of

396
00:39:08.22 --> 00:39:13.98
suppressing fire and let them back out and save them we did that from Marines as well as

397
00:39:13.98 --> 00:39:22.30
United States Army so then um and then this is just what you do this is just the day in

398
00:39:22.30 --> 00:39:27.50
day out all day every day and you're during the night time you you stay you know you stay on

399
00:39:27.50 --> 00:39:31.98
watch but you're in a perimeter somehow and circle up just like wagon trains and an old

400
00:39:31.98 --> 00:39:39.34
western television program like John Wayne in the guys and and then everybody would stay up on

401
00:39:39.34 --> 00:39:44.46
the track there'd be two hours segments from 10 to midnight on down to 6 o'clock in the morning

402
00:39:44.46 --> 00:39:49.74
you'd rotate every two hours and you just be you know you'd have clay mors out and set up your

403
00:39:49.74 --> 00:39:55.34
perimeter defense and everything you'd call in dead cons so that you had positions available for

404
00:39:55.34 --> 00:40:00.86
local artillery could drop stuff real quick if you needed to have it now it seems like it would

405
00:40:00.86 --> 00:40:10.38
not be a great move for the the conner for the NVA to attack you know this you guys I mean

406
00:40:11.26 --> 00:40:17.90
how how often did they attack never well I was there but I think the the big thing is

407
00:40:17.90 --> 00:40:23.50
is is that one of the things you have going for you is you have the speed of movement

408
00:40:23.50 --> 00:40:27.98
that you could travel with an armored personnel carrier so there really wasn't any way that

409
00:40:27.98 --> 00:40:36.62
they could pattern you and go set up in front of you or follow you fast enough to be even if they

410
00:40:36.62 --> 00:40:41.50
probably walk through the night to get you which might have been possible but it never happened

411
00:40:41.50 --> 00:40:46.06
I just don't think they ever tried to do that when they had enough infantry units and Marines

412
00:40:46.06 --> 00:40:51.02
that were in the area and they were walking slower and their movement was slower that's who they

413
00:40:51.02 --> 00:40:58.94
would set up on and then you guys would utilize your firepower to go help out if some infantry unit

414
00:40:58.94 --> 00:41:04.06
called for help you guys were rolling and and laid down the thunder which you guys most certainly

415
00:41:04.06 --> 00:41:10.70
had that weapons package is no is no joke right there wow wow well when you talked about it before

416
00:41:10.70 --> 00:41:17.90
when we rode two machine gunners the hatch was always open on an APC and two machine gunners said

417
00:41:17.90 --> 00:41:24.06
on on the back on that hatch with the guns out to the right and left of course the the turret

418
00:41:24.06 --> 00:41:31.82
was in the center with a 50 caliber and you never got down inside I mean it only if maybe if you were

419
00:41:31.82 --> 00:41:38.38
taking fire you'd get down and get behind the the the M60 but you stayed up on top all the time

420
00:41:38.38 --> 00:41:42.54
because I guess if you were ever going to hit a land mine which is you know something that happened

421
00:41:42.54 --> 00:41:48.22
quite often you didn't want to be down inside with stuff exploding from from that explosion

422
00:41:48.22 --> 00:41:53.66
you wanted to be on the top and maybe get blown clear but so that was out was at the biggest

423
00:41:53.66 --> 00:41:59.50
threat to the tracks was getting hit in some kind of land mine or an RPG rocket from a woodland

424
00:42:00.78 --> 00:42:07.90
the yeah I mean obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan really I mean I can really only talk about

425
00:42:07.90 --> 00:42:14.14
Iraq from my experience but yeah the obviously the roadside bombs were what what they what they did

426
00:42:14.14 --> 00:42:20.14
that was what they did and they did it well and you know the the bigger vehicles that we got

427
00:42:20.78 --> 00:42:26.62
the bigger bombs they built and so when it started my first deployment we were in humvies with

428
00:42:26.62 --> 00:42:31.26
we didn't have we literally didn't have doors on our humvies we actually turned the seats

429
00:42:31.26 --> 00:42:35.98
to face outboard so that we could present our weapon and that we could present our front

430
00:42:35.98 --> 00:42:42.14
plate of our of our body armor and then eventually we put we welded doors together and put

431
00:42:42.14 --> 00:42:46.62
steel doors on and then by the time I got back to Iraq we had armored humvies and then

432
00:42:46.62 --> 00:42:52.54
after that came the big giant of mine resistant vehicles and the whole time the enemy just kept

433
00:42:52.54 --> 00:42:59.66
building bigger and bigger and bigger bombs but we were always we were oftentimes not always but

434
00:42:59.66 --> 00:43:05.66
we were oftentimes channelized on roads because of bridges or because of because of just being

435
00:43:05.66 --> 00:43:13.02
in the city whereas you guys did you guys you guys with tracks in the jungle or you know you guys

436
00:43:13.02 --> 00:43:18.06
could just go wherever you want to do is that right pretty much so the biggest thing that we had to

437
00:43:18.06 --> 00:43:22.54
do and I mean that was the number one thing in part of the training with you drove where you were

438
00:43:22.54 --> 00:43:29.98
commanding a track was you never take the same stream crossing twice you you track the vehicle

439
00:43:29.98 --> 00:43:35.90
right directly in front of you you never get outside of the lead tracks tracks in the ground and we'd

440
00:43:35.90 --> 00:43:41.02
stay in the patties or around the patties as much as possible because it weren't very likely

441
00:43:41.02 --> 00:43:46.06
to put a landmine in the rice patties it would be on the road or the edge of the road or maybe

442
00:43:46.06 --> 00:43:52.46
on a rice petty pike that we never never went in that direction very often either and what was your

443
00:43:52.46 --> 00:43:58.70
leadership like you know your your young lieutenant platoon commander what was he like what was your

444
00:43:58.70 --> 00:44:03.66
platoon sergeant like what did what was your interaction with those guys like and even your vehicle

445
00:44:03.66 --> 00:44:11.34
so who was in charge of of your track was he was a young E5 probably 21 or 22 years old at that time

446
00:44:12.22 --> 00:44:19.02
and the leadership in my platoon the platoon leader was was a great first lieutenant and I mean it was

447
00:44:19.02 --> 00:44:23.10
one of those things that I learned very early on the best thing that I could do for the first three

448
00:44:23.10 --> 00:44:29.18
or four months was just shut up and listen and watch what was going on and follow the lead of the

449
00:44:29.18 --> 00:44:34.46
people that really knew what was going on the platoon sergeant was that same kind of a person

450
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:41.34
the different with the platoon sergeant was that he was probably in his 30s he was married he had

451
00:44:41.34 --> 00:44:49.34
children back home so I don't think it was as easy for him to be a strong leader and a strong

452
00:44:49.34 --> 00:44:58.46
decision maker because I think that was on his mind a lot the L.T. was not that way and everybody

453
00:44:58.46 --> 00:45:05.02
that we served with was not that way I don't know if I know anybody else that I served with

454
00:45:05.02 --> 00:45:11.02
for 10 and a half months that was married other than most of the platoon sergeants or the first

455
00:45:11.02 --> 00:45:16.62
sergeant so they have that in the back of their mind they're thinking about you can sense that

456
00:45:16.62 --> 00:45:23.74
there may be leaning a little bit towards trying to stay alive and trying to take less risk and

457
00:45:23.74 --> 00:45:30.38
you know to all that works is that's not always the best person to have for a leader if you're not

458
00:45:30.38 --> 00:45:38.46
tuned in 24-7 while you're there you're in trouble you know that's the only way to survive you

459
00:45:38.46 --> 00:45:45.10
have to be conscious of every fly that lands on on your food you know what I mean you're just you just

460
00:45:45.10 --> 00:45:50.30
get that heightened sense of awareness that it's probably lucky you can even go to sleep when you

461
00:45:50.30 --> 00:45:56.22
lay down at night because you're the adrenaline is pumps so much all day long yeah something else

462
00:45:56.22 --> 00:46:04.70
that I always felt and I don't know from right or wrong but I always felt that if you were thinking

463
00:46:04.70 --> 00:46:12.62
about other things like family that was going to make you less aggressive and as far as I can tell

464
00:46:12.62 --> 00:46:20.38
if you're aggression if you're not aggressive on the battlefield that has a higher probability

465
00:46:20.38 --> 00:46:28.14
of getting you killed than if you're aggressive I think that hesitation is a bad thing and

466
00:46:28.14 --> 00:46:31.98
I'm looking at saying and I used to try and make this clear all the time and I'm talking about

467
00:46:31.98 --> 00:46:35.26
you know being hyper aggressive and running to your death that's not what I'm talking about but

468
00:46:35.82 --> 00:46:41.10
if there's something going on and you're nervous about making a move that's not a good thing

469
00:46:41.10 --> 00:46:46.46
to have happening and it would make when I would have guys that I could see you were

470
00:46:47.58 --> 00:46:52.62
thinking about other things it would make me nervous that they were going to hesitate when they

471
00:46:52.62 --> 00:46:59.18
needed to move or needed to make something happen. I agree a hundred percent because we experience

472
00:46:59.18 --> 00:47:04.62
a lot of that and the only thing I would do when I got to a position where it was an E5 or eventually

473
00:47:04.62 --> 00:47:12.30
became an E6 was to identify those people and try to utilize them in some spot where they weren't

474
00:47:12.30 --> 00:47:17.42
going to get anybody else killed. That wasn't always real easy to do short of actually sending

475
00:47:17.42 --> 00:47:22.38
him back to the rear area and not let him come out and out in the field with us but if you were

476
00:47:22.38 --> 00:47:28.62
short of people you didn't have that option very often either so you were an E4 when you got in

477
00:47:28.62 --> 00:47:36.54
country and then you got promoted to E5 right did that change your position in the in the track

478
00:47:36.54 --> 00:47:44.38
at all it took me off the machine gun and put me behind the 50. That's good did you

479
00:47:45.42 --> 00:47:50.14
and then did you eventually make E6 I did and did that change your position again at some point

480
00:47:50.14 --> 00:47:55.42
did you become like the vehicle commander I became what was called the field for a surge with the

481
00:47:55.42 --> 00:48:01.74
called six alpha in the in the army I was on the command track out in the field with the company

482
00:48:01.74 --> 00:48:07.34
commander and then two other machine gunners on our track so you did you leave your

483
00:48:07.34 --> 00:48:13.18
platoon to go and be with the company commander I did and what's your what's your job when you're

484
00:48:13.18 --> 00:48:20.14
in that position well basically everything you do for the daily operation you're kind of in charge

485
00:48:20.14 --> 00:48:25.90
over overseeing everything you're you know because keep in mind now we've got not just my third

486
00:48:25.90 --> 00:48:31.74
platoon out there but the second and the first might be with us or they might be off on an operation

487
00:48:31.74 --> 00:48:35.82
of their own sometimes two platoons that go out together and we wanted to go a different

488
00:48:35.82 --> 00:48:41.66
direction so you had to be cognizant of where everybody was all the time and what they were doing

489
00:48:41.66 --> 00:48:46.86
and any difficulties that they were having and it was a brand new company commander who did not

490
00:48:46.86 --> 00:48:54.14
have any Vietnam experience so then it was almost like having to train the CO once he got there so

491
00:48:55.02 --> 00:49:00.78
I think the fact that I got assigned to that track was what the first sergeant felt enough confidence in

492
00:49:00.78 --> 00:49:08.38
me that I could do that and not be a jerk to him or not worry about him being a captain versus me being

493
00:49:08.38 --> 00:49:15.02
any six I mean that part never bothered me anyway you know man never picked much attention to that

494
00:49:15.02 --> 00:49:21.26
so how long had you been in Vietnam when you got moved to that assignment? I had been in country

495
00:49:23.10 --> 00:49:29.58
about eight and a half months so that was that's like perfect then you got a you know year

496
00:49:29.58 --> 00:49:34.94
experience and the the company commander didn't have any experience I know I always had a

497
00:49:35.50 --> 00:49:43.10
I had a special vehicle we in a Humvee the vehicle commander sits in the in the basically the front

498
00:49:43.10 --> 00:49:47.66
right passenger seat and you know you're the one that's supposed to be kind of directing the vehicle and

499
00:49:47.66 --> 00:49:51.98
and I would always have to do other things because I was either an assault force commander,

500
00:49:51.98 --> 00:49:58.62
a ground force commander, whatever so I always had I always took the best smartest driver so that I didn't

501
00:49:58.62 --> 00:50:04.46
have to do worry about him you know and it's kind of the same relationship you know he knew that

502
00:50:04.46 --> 00:50:09.58
hey he needed to handle all the stuff going on with the vehicle but that's um that's like the way the

503
00:50:09.58 --> 00:50:14.70
military does things the military does things like that right there where they take the the new

504
00:50:14.70 --> 00:50:19.58
company commander that doesn't have any experience and they give him a guy that can help

505
00:50:20.70 --> 00:50:26.78
advise him in a you know positive way to make sure he doesn't for lack of a better word

506
00:50:26.78 --> 00:50:35.82
screw anything up. I thought it was a very enjoyable process because I mean I didn't intend to be a

507
00:50:35.82 --> 00:50:44.30
career soldier so I mean I just knew that I had X number of time amount of time days months whatever it

508
00:50:44.30 --> 00:50:51.02
was but I've just always felt like if I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do it to the best of my ability.

509
00:50:51.66 --> 00:50:57.74
I'm sure I didn't have all the answers but I also knew who to to talk to who'd still been around

510
00:50:57.74 --> 00:51:04.22
even longer than I had some guys who had extended been there 14 15 months already you know and

511
00:51:04.22 --> 00:51:10.62
a great deal more experience than I did I would ask I'm not afraid to get information from somebody. I mean that's

512
00:51:11.42 --> 00:51:16.70
that's that knowledge could save a lot of people's lives and that's a big part of what I felt like

513
00:51:16.70 --> 00:51:22.38
I was responsible for now I'm responsible for the whole company which is you know I don't know

514
00:51:22.38 --> 00:51:30.78
210 people I guess at that point. Now you mentioned that the the the the enemy was not outright openly

515
00:51:30.78 --> 00:51:38.78
attacking you but you guys were responding what was the casualty rate for F troop while you were there.

516
00:51:43.42 --> 00:51:50.30
I mean just in terms of how often were you guys taking casualties and I know I looked there's

517
00:51:50.30 --> 00:51:57.18
a really good website that you guys have from F troop and Vietnam and it in why the numbers are

518
00:51:57.18 --> 00:52:06.70
down in 1967 so before you showed up there was there was four people from from F troop that were

519
00:52:06.70 --> 00:52:13.82
killed in action in 1968 so the year that you were there that number went up five times

520
00:52:14.46 --> 00:52:22.14
these were and according to that document it said that there was 20 20 men killed in action in

521
00:52:22.14 --> 00:52:30.14
1968 so that is some heavy contact I mean that's more than 10 percent that's more than 10 percent

522
00:52:30.14 --> 00:52:35.42
that's not that's not counting wounded in action that's all killed in action so even though you said

523
00:52:35.42 --> 00:52:40.38
the enemy wasn't attacking you very often you guys must have been in some significant enemy

524
00:52:40.38 --> 00:52:46.14
contacts to be taken those those kind of casualties. Well and I think most of those that I'm familiar

525
00:52:46.14 --> 00:52:53.66
with were all landmines and they were landmines for people on the vehicles were at blue the M1-1-3

526
00:52:53.66 --> 00:53:01.02
to pieces. I mean the reason we had a new company commander in the fall of 68 was because the

527
00:53:01.02 --> 00:53:07.10
company commander had directed a new driver to do a stream crossing that we knew you shouldn't

528
00:53:07.10 --> 00:53:13.42
cross a second or third time and it blew they hit a 500 pounder and I mean it just killed all

529
00:53:13.42 --> 00:53:19.18
four people on the track and it blew the the captain off he was riding on the driver's hatch

530
00:53:19.18 --> 00:53:24.70
that was open blew him clear but injured him seriously that's why we ended up with a new company

531
00:53:24.70 --> 00:53:30.94
commander and then Jim Stark he was from San Jose, California was a real good friend of mine

532
00:53:30.94 --> 00:53:37.34
was killed in April of 1968 shortly after you know like six weeks after I got in country but

533
00:53:37.34 --> 00:53:43.02
he was just one of those guys that love girls and played sports so immediately became a

534
00:53:43.02 --> 00:53:50.70
great friend. That's one of the horrible things about the one one three and it's really the same

535
00:53:50.70 --> 00:53:56.06
thing with a humvee they built those things to have a low profile because when you're talking

536
00:53:56.06 --> 00:54:01.34
about tank battles what you want to have is you want to have a low profile so that you can hide

537
00:54:01.34 --> 00:54:06.70
behind you can take the vehicle and you can you can sink it into a depression you can get behind

538
00:54:06.70 --> 00:54:12.94
some kind of a terrain feature and not get shot at. The problem with designing vehicles with

539
00:54:12.94 --> 00:54:19.02
an extremely low profile is that they have no ground clearance and so when there's a landmine

540
00:54:20.30 --> 00:54:27.26
underneath them it just it just just wrecks those vehicles and that's why the new vehicles the

541
00:54:27.26 --> 00:54:33.98
mine resistant vehicles their super tall off the ground they have these big V shaped holes that literally

542
00:54:33.98 --> 00:54:40.30
deflects some of the power of the bombs at the enemy plants so that's one of the problems with

543
00:54:40.30 --> 00:54:45.42
these one one three is there's not much ground clearance on them and so when they get hit with a

544
00:54:45.42 --> 00:54:52.86
with a mine it does catastrophic damage often and so that was what you you guys that was the major

545
00:54:54.38 --> 00:54:59.42
threat from the enemy was was hitting these these bombs. Yeah and I would have to guess I mean I

546
00:54:59.42 --> 00:55:05.74
had never heard that number before that we lost 28 in 1968 but I would have to guess it may be two

547
00:55:05.74 --> 00:55:10.86
or three of those might have been small arms fire and the rest were all from their vehicles being

548
00:55:10.86 --> 00:55:23.26
blowing up. How did that grade on your nerves? The the landmine explosions? Yeah. Well again you still

549
00:55:23.26 --> 00:55:29.18
just do everything to the best of your ability you have to track that vehicle in front of you.

550
00:55:29.18 --> 00:55:36.30
Now obviously if you're the lead track and that changes periodically but you're in greater

551
00:55:36.30 --> 00:55:40.46
jeopardy that you could hit something because there's no way in the world that you can't

552
00:55:41.26 --> 00:55:45.90
hang a wound and do you know mind detectors and stuff you're out the middle of nowhere you

553
00:55:45.90 --> 00:55:50.94
probably get shot off the track trying to run detectors and you would just run through it but

554
00:55:50.94 --> 00:56:00.38
in most of ours were not that kind of explosion they were more bad choices by people who thought

555
00:56:00.38 --> 00:56:07.82
this time it's going to be okay and you just can't do things that way it's never going to be

556
00:56:07.82 --> 00:56:14.06
okay it's always going to be bad and if you think that direction you'll usually be safe 90

557
00:56:14.06 --> 00:56:20.62
percent of the time and like I say when the captain made that decision my best friend from

558
00:56:20.62 --> 00:56:26.46
Marks that she texted Chris Wendler was his driver and Chris would have never

559
00:56:26.46 --> 00:56:32.46
crossed that stream as his driver but he had a replacement because Chris was back home in

560
00:56:32.46 --> 00:56:40.22
Texas on a 30 day extension leave and I mean I've asked Chris that question over all the years

561
00:56:40.22 --> 00:56:45.90
of you know would you have crossed it he said but captain Davis probably would have listened to me

562
00:56:45.90 --> 00:56:51.10
but he probably wouldn't listen to anybody else because Chris had a great deal of experience driving

563
00:56:51.10 --> 00:56:55.82
for it that's one of the misconceptions about the military and it's really one of the

564
00:56:55.82 --> 00:57:04.06
misconceptions about leadership is is the last thing that I want as a leader is to have a bunch

565
00:57:04.06 --> 00:57:09.50
of yes men that are just going to do what I tell them to do because I told them to do it I want

566
00:57:09.50 --> 00:57:13.18
people that are going to say hey Jock I don't know if that's the best idea or hey that we should

567
00:57:13.18 --> 00:57:17.50
do this a different way and and people don't think that that's going to happen in the military

568
00:57:17.50 --> 00:57:22.06
that's what you want you want that kind of environment inside the military and the good thing

569
00:57:22.06 --> 00:57:26.54
is that way when I would make a call and guys would execute I knew it was a good call because

570
00:57:26.54 --> 00:57:30.30
no one gave me any pushback because believe me I had a relationship with my guys if I was saying

571
00:57:30.30 --> 00:57:35.74
tell them to do something stupid they'd say hey boss we need to we need to put go go on hold

572
00:57:35.74 --> 00:57:41.34
right now and figure this out there's got to be a better way so that's the way that that's how

573
00:57:41.34 --> 00:57:44.62
I that's how I make good decisions not because I'm great it's because I got a bunch of great

574
00:57:44.62 --> 00:57:48.62
guys working for me that are going to tell me hey that's not the right call and that's a classic

575
00:57:48.62 --> 00:57:55.26
example right there you know if if Chris who had the experience and had the the the the the where

576
00:57:55.26 --> 00:57:59.82
we're fall to say hey boss we don't want to cross right there it's not a good call let's just go

577
00:57:59.82 --> 00:58:06.54
10 meters down mix it up a little bit that's the kind of thing where that that would save lives

578
00:58:06.54 --> 00:58:10.22
and the other thing that you just talked about this is another thing that people get really surprised

579
00:58:10.22 --> 00:58:17.82
about is even because we work I work with a lot of companies and businesses and people say well you

580
00:58:17.82 --> 00:58:25.82
know my guys get complacent with things because you know there's there's it's not combat so people

581
00:58:25.82 --> 00:58:32.38
get complacent I always have to explain people get complacent in combat too you go on you go on

582
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:39.34
your 14th patrol on a row in a row and nothing's happened for the last 13 patrols and you think

583
00:58:39.34 --> 00:58:45.10
oh you know we can we can cross here or we don't need to we need to pack extra ammo or I don't

584
00:58:45.10 --> 00:58:50.70
need to carry that extra radio battery because I have a needed yet and we cut those corners when you

585
00:58:50.70 --> 00:58:57.50
get complacent that's when these horrible things happen you cannot get complacent and all those

586
00:58:58.22 --> 00:59:04.54
all those service men out there right now service men and women don't cut corners don't do it you

587
00:59:04.54 --> 00:59:10.78
got to hold the line and if you see people cutting corners call them out one of the biggest

588
00:59:10.78 --> 00:59:16.14
things that some of the infantry units used to do is get complacent and not put claim wars out

589
00:59:16.14 --> 00:59:21.90
when they set up for the night and just like you mentioned it might have worked 12 or 13 times before

590
00:59:21.90 --> 00:59:27.10
but the one time you decide you're going to leave it in your pack that's exactly when Charlie

591
00:59:27.10 --> 00:59:32.70
decides to come through the perimeter not that he knew but you weren't prepared you know that's

592
00:59:32.70 --> 00:59:38.78
that's the guaranteed way to get attacked don't set up claim wars every time you set up claim

593
00:59:38.78 --> 00:59:42.78
wars in your prepared and everyone standard watch correctly that's how you don't get attacked

594
00:59:42.78 --> 00:59:48.38
the minute that someone slacks off yeah that's that's what that's what sent you going sideways now

595
00:59:48.38 --> 00:59:54.62
you mentioned the draftees that pretty much when you were there once you guys were in country once

596
00:59:54.62 --> 00:59:59.50
you were doing your job did you could you even tell the difference between who's a draftee

597
00:59:59.50 --> 01:00:03.58
and who wasn't only if you would ask him if that was the case because there was no other

598
01:00:03.58 --> 01:00:09.90
identification anybody but you know again I say this because in ten and a half months period of

599
01:00:09.90 --> 01:00:14.46
time they were still the most courageous and brave people that I've ever served with I think they

600
01:00:14.46 --> 01:00:20.54
resolved all that draft stuff and I don't want to be here before they got in country or right

601
01:00:20.54 --> 01:00:25.66
after they got in country because they were they were not complacent at all once once I started

602
01:00:25.66 --> 01:00:32.86
to work with them yeah I had a retired general who is who is what a David hackworth's

603
01:00:35.34 --> 01:00:40.38
company commanders and Vietnam and I asked him about the draftees and he said he couldn't tell

604
01:00:40.38 --> 01:00:45.98
who is a draftee and who wasn't and and I always you know I hear a lot of people ask me about

605
01:00:46.78 --> 01:00:50.86
again the skating into the business world people ask me about what it's like to or you know how

606
01:00:50.86 --> 01:00:58.30
how do you handle these millennials and I always bring up people like hackworth who says

607
01:00:58.30 --> 01:01:02.86
who hackworth said he loved his draftees I mean I don't think you need a harger workforce

608
01:01:02.86 --> 01:01:07.26
to deal with and someone that was drafted to Vietnam that doesn't believe in the war that doesn't

609
01:01:07.26 --> 01:01:12.30
want to be there and who can lose their life doing this job okay I get it the millennial might

610
01:01:12.30 --> 01:01:16.62
like looking at his phone or whatever but that's still as a completely different deal but if you have

611
01:01:16.62 --> 01:01:22.86
good leadership and you explain to them why it's important and you get them involved and give

612
01:01:22.86 --> 01:01:28.86
them ownership they'll step up and you're the you're another example of someone looking at me

613
01:01:28.86 --> 01:01:35.26
and saying hey the draftees if they knew it was going on we couldn't tell who is who and that's

614
01:01:35.26 --> 01:01:41.58
again a testament not only to good leadership but it's a testament to to American soldier and what

615
01:01:41.58 --> 01:01:50.46
we do here when you you you said you got shifted into that new job with the company commander

616
01:01:51.10 --> 01:01:57.10
at eight and a half months at are you starting you know and we said this a little bit

617
01:01:58.22 --> 01:02:03.90
not as much as you guys not as much as I hear about it in Vietnam but we might have had this creep into

618
01:02:03.90 --> 01:02:09.98
our head a little bit of the idea of you know you got short time and it's almost time to go home

619
01:02:09.98 --> 01:02:15.18
and and did that start creeping into your mind at all at eight and a half months there was that

620
01:02:15.18 --> 01:02:20.06
too far away where you're not even thinking about it yet I honestly never gave it any thought at all

621
01:02:20.06 --> 01:02:25.02
I mean I knew when my rotation date was but a lot of guys actually made what was called a short time

622
01:02:25.02 --> 01:02:32.86
calendar that's a bad idea never never never did that at all so you just every day was a new day

623
01:02:32.86 --> 01:02:37.82
you're going to do your best job and if you're doing what you're doing that's the best you can do

624
01:02:37.82 --> 01:02:43.66
and that's one more thing I wanted to say this because again we got young folks in the military out there

625
01:02:44.06 --> 01:02:49.18
when I was talking about hey some people are afraid some people are in a afraid some people think it's

626
01:02:49.18 --> 01:02:54.06
gonna happen them some people think it'll never happen them look wherever you are on that spectrum

627
01:02:54.70 --> 01:03:00.46
what what I can say is this there's things that you can control there's things that you can't control

628
01:03:01.26 --> 01:03:07.18
and as you're going into combat before you're going to combat train hard be prepared

629
01:03:07.18 --> 01:03:12.70
know your weapon systems know your immediate action drills then that's that's the best you can do

630
01:03:12.70 --> 01:03:18.46
you've done everything you can to take control over what you can control once you're in combat there's

631
01:03:18.46 --> 01:03:23.98
some things that you're not going to be able to control and if you worry about those things it's

632
01:03:23.98 --> 01:03:30.06
actually a set it actually negatively impact you if you're worried about things that you can't

633
01:03:30.06 --> 01:03:33.66
control if you're worried about what's going on at home if you're worried about mate all those things

634
01:03:33.66 --> 01:03:37.82
they're gonna take away your aggressiveness take take away your awareness take away your attention

635
01:03:38.22 --> 01:03:43.58
those things are gonna drag you in the wrong direction so don't worry about the things that you

636
01:03:43.58 --> 01:03:49.82
can't control it's okay to be afraid too like hey if you're if you're scared guess what it's normal

637
01:03:49.82 --> 01:03:54.06
you're going into a hard situation it's normal you're gonna be you're gonna feel that you're going to

638
01:03:54.06 --> 01:03:59.50
feel your gut's gonna feel uh what do they say butterflies in your stomach that's normal it's okay

639
01:03:59.50 --> 01:04:05.42
it's no big deal that's what people feel it's you don't need to think your your weak because you're

640
01:04:05.42 --> 01:04:10.22
feeling that you're just going into survival mode you got butterflies in your stomach because

641
01:04:10.22 --> 01:04:13.82
your blood's drawn away from there because you want to focus on other things it's a positive thing

642
01:04:14.86 --> 01:04:19.58
so don't worry about those things you can't control focus on what you can control and if you're

643
01:04:19.58 --> 01:04:24.14
if you're feeling a little bit afraid good that means your your mind isn't the right place you're

644
01:04:24.14 --> 01:04:30.22
aware and you're in a hyper sensory mode so you can survive out on the battlefield that's what's going on

645
01:04:32.22 --> 01:04:40.94
um what was the what was going on with the mission where you got wounded

646
01:04:42.78 --> 01:04:48.94
we've been out on a searching clear for that whole day I mean probably it'd been out in the field

647
01:04:48.94 --> 01:04:55.18
for six or seven days at that point I had picked the night longer position we set up that evening

648
01:04:55.18 --> 01:05:00.54
about five to six o'clock we were supposed to get resupply and get get hotchow that night brought

649
01:05:00.54 --> 01:05:07.58
up by helicopter and so what I was doing was once the platoon's got set up on the perimeter

650
01:05:07.58 --> 01:05:13.90
and our command track was in the center of the circle I went out to check the um clay morson

651
01:05:13.90 --> 01:05:18.54
all the perimeter defense to make sure that everybody put out what I mean because I just did that

652
01:05:18.54 --> 01:05:24.22
before I don't know whether that was my responsibility as in my new position but I probably

653
01:05:24.22 --> 01:05:29.10
slept much better knowing that I had checked it and that's when I stepped on a landmine was

654
01:05:29.10 --> 01:05:35.34
checking the perimeter and what do you remember about stepping on a landmine? I don't remember it

655
01:05:35.34 --> 01:05:41.10
blowing I remember going up in the air and I remember coming back down I never lost consciousness

656
01:05:41.10 --> 01:05:47.02
um you know from the from the explosion but when I laid on my back and the medic came over and I

657
01:05:47.02 --> 01:05:52.22
known the medic for seven or eight months and and tears were running down his face and he was

658
01:05:52.22 --> 01:05:58.62
telling me I was going to be okay I knew it wasn't real good. Not what you want to hear from the

659
01:05:58.62 --> 01:06:04.54
medic on it at what point so that was so then what happens? You're well I mean I I laid there

660
01:06:04.54 --> 01:06:08.62
for a little bit while he's trying to do stuff the interesting thing that happened with my

661
01:06:08.62 --> 01:06:14.78
my explosion was all powder there was no shrapnel to it whatsoever must just been a bag of

662
01:06:14.78 --> 01:06:21.42
H.E. you know so when it blew it actually blew in a gigantic ball of flame and it partially

663
01:06:21.42 --> 01:06:26.94
caught a rise my arteries that were exposed and probably actually saved my life at the same time

664
01:06:26.94 --> 01:06:32.46
the dampy tated both of my legs and my arm because I didn't lose consciousness and he wasn't

665
01:06:32.46 --> 01:06:37.74
forced to do turn against and all kinds of other stuff to try to save me so you know whatever time

666
01:06:37.74 --> 01:06:42.22
I spent on the ground then dust off helicopter and about a 12 minute ride to the 95th of the

667
01:06:42.22 --> 01:06:46.78
back and that's kind of the way that one worked. He didn't even put turnic hits on you.

668
01:06:46.78 --> 01:06:51.26
Didn't have to do so you lost both legs you lost your arm you didn't put turnic hits on anything.

669
01:06:51.26 --> 01:06:55.26
Right that's crazy. Is it burn shut? Wow. Yeah.

670
01:06:56.30 --> 01:07:01.42
Hey do you we burned anywhere else on your body? Some you know done my chest and under this

671
01:07:01.42 --> 01:07:07.18
arm because most of the blast came up the left hand side that's what saved my right arm I guess.

672
01:07:07.18 --> 01:07:12.30
Did you where were you wearing a flat jacket? No. Did you how often were you guys wearing flat jackets?

673
01:07:12.30 --> 01:07:17.90
When you were on the track and rolling but just don't walk around generally didn't you know you

674
01:07:17.90 --> 01:07:23.50
wouldn't even you'd roll up your pant legs because it was so hot you'd just wear a t-shirt

675
01:07:23.50 --> 01:07:29.10
and carry your weapon. So 12 minute flight and where did they take you?

676
01:07:29.10 --> 01:07:34.54
The 95th of the back and the knee back hospital and were you still conscious at this point?

677
01:07:34.54 --> 01:07:38.78
No, I lost consciousness on the flight because I knew I went into shock as I felt like I was

678
01:07:38.78 --> 01:07:45.34
going to freeze to death soon as the chopper lifted off and then I remember maybe a little bit of

679
01:07:45.34 --> 01:07:50.62
consciousness when I first got to the 95th of the back don't know exactly what they did there but

680
01:07:50.62 --> 01:07:54.46
it was a real slow night so it wasn't like there was a lot of casualties and they didn't have

681
01:07:54.46 --> 01:07:58.78
to triage you never know how that might work out either if they have to pick and choose who they're

682
01:07:58.78 --> 01:08:03.58
going to work on so they just took me right in and you know got me right up on the table to

683
01:08:03.58 --> 01:08:07.98
begin with and went to work. Did you know did you know while you were conscious that you lost

684
01:08:07.98 --> 01:08:13.10
your legs and your arm? The only thing I remember when I was laying on my back out in the field after

685
01:08:13.10 --> 01:08:20.22
the explosion was I reached down with my good arm and I could touch this stump as long enough that

686
01:08:20.22 --> 01:08:25.26
if I'm laying on my back I can probably touch it but not all the way to the end so I felt like I

687
01:08:25.26 --> 01:08:30.30
still had this leg. I couldn't reach the other side I didn't know how badly damaged all of this

688
01:08:30.30 --> 01:08:37.02
was didn't know that till I actually got to Japan quite some time after you know the evac

689
01:08:37.02 --> 01:08:43.82
hospital and a bunch of surgeries in Japan so when they when you so when you lose conscious they put

690
01:08:43.82 --> 01:08:49.66
you in a medically induced coma. They didn't do that when I was at the 95th of back in

691
01:08:49.66 --> 01:08:56.70
denang but they did it shortly after I got to the 106 general in Yokohama Japan and I was unconscious

692
01:08:56.70 --> 01:09:06.54
from the 14th of January of 69 to the 15th of February of 69 31 days 31 days that's a medically

693
01:09:06.54 --> 01:09:14.94
induced coma and then you wake up and you're in Japan and what kind of a shock was that when you

694
01:09:14.94 --> 01:09:20.46
woke up? Well I mean I really didn't know for sure exactly where I was when I woke up but you

695
01:09:20.46 --> 01:09:24.70
know I mean it doesn't take you too long to figure out because the nurses are all coming around

696
01:09:24.70 --> 01:09:29.90
and they would actually straight up ask you do you know where you are you know so if you didn't they tell

697
01:09:29.90 --> 01:09:39.10
you and you know that was more for me to spend five weeks there was highly unusual. Normally

698
01:09:39.10 --> 01:09:45.66
all you did was come through the 106 or campzam in Japan for the army and they'd stabilize

699
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:50.14
make sure you're going to be strong enough to make the trip back across specific to get to

700
01:09:50.14 --> 01:09:56.38
back to the states and I think they just once they got started with me and on any surgeries I think

701
01:09:56.38 --> 01:10:01.50
somebody just made a decision let's just do all of them right here let's not worry about waiting

702
01:10:02.06 --> 01:10:05.98
while we've got him in the position that we have him and let's just keep him there and go in

703
01:10:05.98 --> 01:10:11.58
and not a surgery so I mean I'm actually probably pretty fortunate that they did and then you know

704
01:10:11.58 --> 01:10:17.26
like a week after I came out of the coma they tried to feed you regular food but I'll guarantee

705
01:10:17.26 --> 01:10:23.02
that when you have an eaten for five weeks nothing looks real good it doesn't taste very good either so

706
01:10:23.02 --> 01:10:30.86
but I did regain enough strength to make the trip back across specific went to landed in

707
01:10:30.86 --> 01:10:36.46
California at Travis Air Force Base in California and spent the night and then went on to

708
01:10:37.42 --> 01:10:43.18
fit Simmons General Hospital in a Rara Colorado. It's right did the rest of my rehab for another nine

709
01:10:43.18 --> 01:10:48.86
months so when you when you figure out that you know you lost both your legs you lost your arm

710
01:10:48.86 --> 01:10:54.30
what what are you thinking at this point? I mean there's a lot of stuff when I when I got back

711
01:10:54.30 --> 01:11:00.86
to the states I actually got sick whether an airborne thing or whatever it was and I mean I was

712
01:11:00.86 --> 01:11:05.10
to the point where not only could I not eat whole food but I couldn't even really drink

713
01:11:05.74 --> 01:11:11.66
hardly any liquid it wouldn't stay down either so they kind of estimate I went from 220 pounds

714
01:11:11.66 --> 01:11:18.06
before the explosion to about 150 after the explosion and then from the time they put me on the

715
01:11:18.06 --> 01:11:23.50
plane in Japan and suddenly back to the states they figure out probably weighed about 135 pounds

716
01:11:24.06 --> 01:11:29.90
and then after I got sick at fits Simmons until like you know actually started being able to eat again

717
01:11:29.90 --> 01:11:38.22
I waited about 95 or 98 pounds so I think did they share some photos with you? I did I saw something

718
01:11:38.22 --> 01:11:45.58
and that that one is kind of a scary I mean it's kind of a Auschwitz like looking photograph

719
01:11:45.58 --> 01:11:52.14
I guess is the way I describe it right? Yeah and when you were going through that are you thinking

720
01:11:53.34 --> 01:12:01.34
I mean is it is it that you can't hold your food down is it that your you don't have an appetite

721
01:12:01.34 --> 01:12:08.06
I think you're probably a combination of a lot of things but they think I had some sort of

722
01:12:09.10 --> 01:12:16.22
virus or something that you know because I'd really only been back to the states for 30 days

723
01:12:16.22 --> 01:12:21.26
and almost a two-year period of time something that I picked up some or could have even been in the

724
01:12:21.26 --> 01:12:27.34
hospital in Japan because I mean I ate food for a week in Japan before I got on the flight back to

725
01:12:27.34 --> 01:12:33.02
the states and when I got back to fits Simmons I would just sick I mean I couldn't horrible sick

726
01:12:33.98 --> 01:12:40.62
enough to lose like 40 more pounds and that's that's that's crazy now did you get like the

727
01:12:40.62 --> 01:12:48.22
Phantom pain and your limbs and stuff for the first five years it's really pretty bad I mean it

728
01:12:48.22 --> 01:12:52.86
because it's like you still feel like you have those limbs like you feel like you need to scratch

729
01:12:52.86 --> 01:12:58.06
behind your knee or scratch you know your hand is itching that type of thing it's almost like you're

730
01:12:58.06 --> 01:13:03.50
bald up in a fist where your fingernails are pushed into your hand type of thing and little by

731
01:13:03.50 --> 01:13:09.74
little I think is those nerve endings received from the surgery and the amputations a lot of that

732
01:13:09.74 --> 01:13:15.34
relaxes and changes I don't get that at all anymore but I mean it's been 50 years now so

733
01:13:15.34 --> 01:13:23.42
so when you get to the fits Simmons Army Medical Center to start your rehab I mean at this point

734
01:13:24.30 --> 01:13:32.06
then it must have been not too many guys that were in worship than you are at 90 pounds and sick

735
01:13:32.06 --> 01:13:38.62
and missing three limbs I mean you must have been in comparatively and the reason I say that is because

736
01:13:38.62 --> 01:13:42.70
you know with the moderate advances with combat trauma and how quickly we can matter

737
01:13:42.70 --> 01:13:48.70
back guys off the battlefield and we get guys that are in horrible suffering horrible wounds but they're

738
01:13:48.70 --> 01:13:54.54
able to survive because the medical advancement that we have but for you it was like a miracle

739
01:13:54.54 --> 01:14:00.54
through the the type of blast I mean because if that would have been any other type of blast the chances

740
01:14:00.54 --> 01:14:07.10
of you being alive are very slim so when you got there I'm like what would the other guys think it

741
01:14:07.10 --> 01:14:12.38
mean I mean there was two other triple amputees that were already at fits Simmons at the time

742
01:14:13.02 --> 01:14:20.14
the orthopedic words were full of single leg and double leg amputations because I mean that's exactly

743
01:14:20.14 --> 01:14:25.18
what they're placing via now I'm all the time not much different than a rack and Afghanistan

744
01:14:25.18 --> 01:14:31.18
we're watching a lot of young guys come back with multiple amputations so I mean I think you

745
01:14:31.18 --> 01:14:37.74
you cared for one another is where you got your support I mean the hospital staff did everything

746
01:14:37.74 --> 01:14:43.58
they possibly could they were incredible doctors nurses you know aids whatever it was

747
01:14:44.22 --> 01:14:49.98
but actually another triple amputee was more beneficial to my survival someone who'd been there

748
01:14:49.98 --> 01:14:54.78
for two months three months or four months before I got hurt you know and then you could at least

749
01:14:54.78 --> 01:14:59.10
you could emulate and say you look at this guy can make it I can make it I'm not sure what I'm

750
01:14:59.10 --> 01:15:02.70
going to do with the rest of my life but I think I'm going to be okay I'm going to be alive

751
01:15:04.06 --> 01:15:10.70
and then how long how long was that rehab at fits Simmons that was nine months total

752
01:15:10.70 --> 01:15:18.22
because I got discharge from the military on the 22nd of November 1969 and that's occupational therapy

753
01:15:18.22 --> 01:15:25.26
working with a prosthetic arm making sure that you can use it and function with it I had prosthetic legs

754
01:15:25.26 --> 01:15:31.42
walked in the parallel bars but but not a it's not anything you're going to use the rest of your

755
01:15:31.42 --> 01:15:37.74
life and even if you fast forward today's modern limbs with computers and everything else

756
01:15:37.74 --> 01:15:44.38
it still wouldn't work for a triple amputee in in my condition and you wouldn't be able to function

757
01:15:45.02 --> 01:15:50.22
the same way that I do today to be able to get out and go and do things and be aggressive

758
01:15:50.22 --> 01:15:56.70
if you had to worry about trying to put those things on deal with them all day long worry about

759
01:15:56.70 --> 01:16:02.22
falling somewhere not being able to get back up so I mean it was a real easy decision for me and

760
01:16:02.22 --> 01:16:08.78
like October early November 69 that we'll just put those in a trunk someplace and have great

761
01:16:08.78 --> 01:16:14.38
memories about walking in the parallel bars so you were done with rehab at nine months

762
01:16:14.38 --> 01:16:21.34
well really once you heal and if you're not going to do anything further with prosthetic legs

763
01:16:21.90 --> 01:16:26.86
and they need a bed because you're still killing and injuring a lot of people in Vietnam in November

764
01:16:26.86 --> 01:16:35.34
1969 you know you got to move on something's got to happen so 1969 this is this is at the height

765
01:16:35.34 --> 01:16:45.66
of like anti-war protests and woodstock was in woodstock was in August of 1969 are you paying

766
01:16:45.66 --> 01:16:49.50
attention to that is that entering your world at all or we're we're watching it on the

767
01:16:49.50 --> 01:16:54.30
ward in the day room and probably just getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment out of it because

768
01:16:54.30 --> 01:17:00.30
we're all sitting around we're all Vietnam combat soldiers you know on the ward so you know

769
01:17:00.30 --> 01:17:06.78
you know I think some people actually talk but maybe we should go to woodstock I don't think anybody did though

770
01:17:07.66 --> 01:17:14.94
but did you feel like like I know that our treatment from the wars from the wars that we've been

771
01:17:14.94 --> 01:17:20.38
in the last couple decades you know we've had great treatment from for the most part we've had

772
01:17:20.38 --> 01:17:27.34
incredibly incredible treatment from not just from well from from people from normal citizens you know

773
01:17:27.34 --> 01:17:31.66
that it's thank you for your service it's thank you for what you did regardless of whatever

774
01:17:31.66 --> 01:17:35.82
their political beliefs are as well it's like most people say hey we know that you were doing

775
01:17:35.82 --> 01:17:42.06
your job and and that's thank you did you feel mattered did you feel did you feel like it was

776
01:17:42.06 --> 01:17:47.42
did you get the negative feedback that we often hear about from Vietnam bets I never got any of

777
01:17:47.42 --> 01:17:53.42
the negative personally I know a lot of people who did and most of that was people who came back

778
01:17:53.42 --> 01:17:59.66
uningered we got off of that same transport a travel-sair force base or or up at Fort Lewis

779
01:17:59.66 --> 01:18:05.74
Washington moved to a civilian aircraft most of them would change out of their military clothing

780
01:18:05.74 --> 01:18:11.66
in the civilian clothing so that they couldn't be recognized or wouldn't be readily identified

781
01:18:11.66 --> 01:18:16.54
as being returning from Vietnam the only thing that I ever really experienced that I didn't

782
01:18:16.54 --> 01:18:21.82
know this until after I got to fit Simmons was lawrear force base used to be right in downtown

783
01:18:21.82 --> 01:18:26.54
Denver and that's normally where the transport would have brought me would have been to lawreary

784
01:18:26.54 --> 01:18:32.38
but because they were having protesters outside the gate at lawrear force base they landed in

785
01:18:32.38 --> 01:18:37.66
an old world war two-feel called Buckley Field outside of Denver and the protesters never knew

786
01:18:37.66 --> 01:18:42.62
where that was at so then they'd load you on the on the hospital bus and take you right to the

787
01:18:42.62 --> 01:18:48.38
hospital luckily the protesters weren't smart enough to figure that out so you get done with this

788
01:18:48.38 --> 01:18:53.82
you get discharged from the army that's it and now we go and now and now what's your what's your plan

789
01:18:53.82 --> 01:19:00.86
now didn't have the famous idea we should get tell you I'd really thought that went out in a big

790
01:19:00.86 --> 01:19:08.54
way but I mean I think you're you're kind of still in a form of survival mode at that point you know

791
01:19:08.54 --> 01:19:17.50
to mean each each new experience I mean getting in and out of the shower getting on and off

792
01:19:17.50 --> 01:19:26.38
of a commode feeding yourself putting clothes on wondering if you're gonna be able to drive again

793
01:19:26.38 --> 01:19:32.54
are the things that are paramount in your mind at that point because you know what it takes to

794
01:19:32.54 --> 01:19:38.78
do stuff out there in the world and I mean I would I would go to physical therapy I'd go to

795
01:19:38.78 --> 01:19:45.66
occupational therapy I'd come back to the ward and I'd be thinking about things and my my

796
01:19:45.66 --> 01:19:52.70
Catholic upbringing and in Minnesota and the Bible and things that take place I'm waiting for

797
01:19:53.50 --> 01:20:00.14
something outside my hospital ward window like a burning busher of bolt a lightning and there's

798
01:20:00.14 --> 01:20:05.02
going to be a revelation gymsurcely this is what you're going to do for the rest of your life

799
01:20:05.90 --> 01:20:11.42
it never happened it didn't come so you know now I'm still praying

800
01:20:11.42 --> 01:20:17.98
but I'm actually getting angry with God at this point because I'm not getting any answers

801
01:20:19.02 --> 01:20:23.58
and maybe's answering things but I'm not smart enough to recognize it I don't know

802
01:20:24.46 --> 01:20:29.98
but I think what I actually did at that point which I think is my survival and what allowed

803
01:20:29.98 --> 01:20:36.62
me to move forward with my life was I surrendered I just said I said to God here's the deal

804
01:20:36.62 --> 01:20:44.38
your job is to take care of a vision or things that you have in store for me for the rest of my

805
01:20:44.38 --> 01:20:51.82
life my job is to do occupational therapy physical therapy and maybe as new guys come in my

806
01:20:51.82 --> 01:20:57.10
job has helped inspire them to realize that they're still going to be a life beyond the

807
01:20:57.10 --> 01:21:03.34
injuries you've sustained and I mean it's not like you did that one day in the next day it was perfect

808
01:21:03.34 --> 01:21:08.30
you know it was still a process every day you'd have to kind of go through that little bit of

809
01:21:08.30 --> 01:21:14.22
surrender all the time until you finally just came to the conclusion that if you just relax

810
01:21:15.02 --> 01:21:20.46
do what you're supposed to do everything else is going to be okay in a truly turned out that way

811
01:21:21.74 --> 01:21:26.94
so that when you're going to occupational therapy is that when you're are you still at

812
01:21:26.94 --> 01:21:32.78
fit Simmons when you're talking about that right and so now you're helping people out you get this

813
01:21:32.78 --> 01:21:38.54
kind of point in your life where you say okay I'm going to do my part and I'm going to let God

814
01:21:38.54 --> 01:21:43.42
handle his part I'm not going to worry about what he's going to do with me I'm going to do what

815
01:21:43.42 --> 01:21:49.34
I'm supposed to do right now you do that for nine months when you get done at fit Simmons

816
01:21:49.34 --> 01:21:56.54
where do you go and when back home to Rochester Minnesota and stayed at my parents' house

817
01:21:56.54 --> 01:22:03.90
and I remember specifically the chief of physical medicine said to my mom when they were there

818
01:22:03.90 --> 01:22:09.58
said now whatever you do when you get him home I don't want you to wait on him all the time because

819
01:22:09.58 --> 01:22:14.94
that's the worst thing you can possibly do and you know they're explaining that to your mother

820
01:22:14.94 --> 01:22:20.70
and you're 21 years old and she knows this guy's full of shit because I'm going to go home and

821
01:22:20.70 --> 01:22:27.18
just bathe him like he was two years old so I sat on the couch for I mean not every day but

822
01:22:27.18 --> 01:22:31.26
on the couch and I tell her to bring me the remote and change the channel and give me a

823
01:22:31.26 --> 01:22:36.14
Pepsi and do all that kind of stuff and finally about 30 days in it I said something to her

824
01:22:36.14 --> 01:22:41.82
one day and she said why don't you get off your story ass and get it yourself and I said mom

825
01:22:41.82 --> 01:22:47.74
I just can't believe it took you 30 days to give me that response you're you're melted as long as

826
01:22:47.74 --> 01:22:52.14
you're here I said well I I don't know if you knew it mom but I overheard the chief of physical

827
01:22:52.14 --> 01:22:59.02
medicine tell you that so I had to use it so then once so you're living at home and what

828
01:22:59.02 --> 01:23:07.82
did that what did that look like it's kind of a scary experience because you're going back to

829
01:23:08.86 --> 01:23:14.14
an able-bodied world even though the male clinics there in Rochester Minnesota there's still

830
01:23:14.14 --> 01:23:21.82
streets don't have curb cuts buildings are not level to the ground every building doesn't have

831
01:23:21.82 --> 01:23:27.98
an elevator to get you to the second floor the Americas would disability act didn't come into

832
01:23:27.98 --> 01:23:33.42
play into the late 70s or early 80s so I mean it wasn't like anybody had to do anything to

833
01:23:33.42 --> 01:23:41.74
accommodate disabled people there were not a lot of disabled people on the street out in public

834
01:23:41.74 --> 01:23:47.98
either working or going to school or anything else they had there was a system off to the side

835
01:23:47.98 --> 01:23:54.14
I think for disabled people but I think the Vietnam veterans came back and were were vocal

836
01:23:54.14 --> 01:24:01.26
and pushy and just decided we weren't willing to accept that as being the standard and that's not

837
01:24:01.26 --> 01:24:06.94
what I want to do for the rest of my life so primarily I came back and I started junior college

838
01:24:06.94 --> 01:24:13.02
and then at least when you're in school there's vet groups at school so you had that sharing again

839
01:24:13.02 --> 01:24:17.66
I mean if I had difficult getting from one location or another I could holler at somebody they'd

840
01:24:17.66 --> 01:24:24.22
give me a push to my next class or carry books and I'd push whatever so I mean little by little you

841
01:24:24.22 --> 01:24:30.30
realized you got to swallow a little bit of pride and you may need that help at times if you're

842
01:24:30.30 --> 01:24:34.86
going to get back into civilian life if you're going to be part of it and if you want to join the

843
01:24:34.86 --> 01:24:40.38
human race that's what you're going to have to do is accept some help and some guidance along the way so

844
01:24:41.02 --> 01:24:47.26
that's what I did and little by little that just gets better every day and every week and every

845
01:24:47.26 --> 01:24:52.78
years so you see what did you start studying in school well I wanted to be a CPA

846
01:24:53.34 --> 01:24:58.86
until I actually got to all those big long ledger sheets and I said oh my god really

847
01:24:59.74 --> 01:25:04.70
I don't want to do this for the rest of my life so just I just changed the general business

848
01:25:04.70 --> 01:25:12.46
general business and then you graduate from junior college graduate from junior college

849
01:25:13.10 --> 01:25:18.70
went to what's now called the University of Central Florida was called FTU at the time

850
01:25:18.70 --> 01:25:25.90
continued towards the business degree but did not finish and get a degree but I finished

851
01:25:25.90 --> 01:25:31.74
about halfway through my senior year and then I went to work and what you go to work doing

852
01:25:31.74 --> 01:25:37.90
well I've been a real estate agent for 40 years in Florida and then I'm also a real estate investor

853
01:25:37.90 --> 01:25:45.50
and I have a small roofing company so straight from school you you must have started to delve

854
01:25:45.50 --> 01:25:51.50
into real estate before you decided you're going to leave school I had actually the guy I knew

855
01:25:51.50 --> 01:25:56.38
the guy real well that on the real estate company and he had asked me because they had a van

856
01:25:56.38 --> 01:26:03.10
a lot of people with wheelchairs use we would carry his real estate signs out the bigger ones

857
01:26:03.10 --> 01:26:07.90
and smaller ones and I would I would drive and he would put up the signs he was fairly new in the

858
01:26:07.90 --> 01:26:13.90
business too so I think that just sort of got me excited about what he was doing and I would he would

859
01:26:13.90 --> 01:26:18.22
say you need to go get your real estate license and said yeah when was the last time you bought a

860
01:26:18.22 --> 01:26:22.46
house from a guy in a wheelchair missing two legs in an army go add don't worry about it they'll

861
01:26:22.46 --> 01:26:29.10
never even notice I mean that's just the kind of guy he was it sounds like he was absolutely

862
01:26:30.94 --> 01:26:36.62
it doesn't take arms and a leg to explain to people that this thing is about through

863
01:26:36.62 --> 01:26:41.10
him central air and heat three bedrooms and all that kind of stuff usually most people are

864
01:26:41.10 --> 01:26:46.30
pretty intelligent lesser blind and they can't see it they can pretty well figure out what it is

865
01:26:46.94 --> 01:26:51.50
my pointing those things out doesn't make them want to buy it what it is and where it is

866
01:26:51.50 --> 01:26:57.42
is usually why they buy it and that was is that is that what you ended up doing for your whole

867
01:26:57.42 --> 01:27:01.74
career you said you've been doing it for four or you did it for 40 years or I got my real estate

868
01:27:01.74 --> 01:27:09.74
license in 1978 and then courses is part of selling things deals come along that are worth owning

869
01:27:10.30 --> 01:27:14.86
so I would buy him kept him for rental property and still have all those today

870
01:27:14.86 --> 01:27:22.70
nice moves I gotta ask you this because you know a lot of a lot of vets listen to this

871
01:27:24.06 --> 01:27:32.06
what did you see in terms of alcohol and drugs especially when you were in rehab when you're coming

872
01:27:32.06 --> 01:27:40.14
out of rehab what did you see what was your attitude how did you avoid going down the path of

873
01:27:40.14 --> 01:27:48.14
where people end up you know either addicted alcohol or addicted to drugs you know and that's a kind

874
01:27:48.14 --> 01:27:52.54
of a good question because there was a lot of that there were a lot of guys especially alcohol because

875
01:27:52.54 --> 01:27:58.54
you could just go off the base and and go someplace in the evening the drugs I think they were

876
01:27:58.54 --> 01:28:05.74
a little less likely to give you more than you actually needed during the Vietnam era that was my

877
01:28:05.74 --> 01:28:13.66
experience and my father was an alcoholic so I'm sure probably in the back of my mind the use of it

878
01:28:13.66 --> 01:28:20.78
or abuse of it was probably something I was conscious of all the time but that never really looked like

879
01:28:20.78 --> 01:28:27.34
that was a great alternative path I mean I thought that was fairly easy to recognize that

880
01:28:27.34 --> 01:28:33.58
that wasn't good and and I'm not critical of anyone that chose that because everybody's

881
01:28:33.58 --> 01:28:38.46
psyche and the way they're handling things at that time the difficulties you're going through

882
01:28:38.46 --> 01:28:43.66
or just being out in public missing two legs in a room maybe you need to be high to do that

883
01:28:44.22 --> 01:28:48.14
I never felt that way I didn't feel like I needed to explain anything to anybody

884
01:28:48.62 --> 01:28:54.78
had to put on any particular performance or airstone make people accept me if you didn't accept me

885
01:28:54.78 --> 01:28:59.82
I'm okay with that too you know what I mean that was fine because I'm just going to do

886
01:28:59.82 --> 01:29:06.46
what I need to do for my survival and for me to move forward and I had a lot of support from family

887
01:29:06.46 --> 01:29:13.26
and friends that allowed me to be that way man I wish I could spread that word to

888
01:29:13.98 --> 01:29:18.70
basically everyone you know not to worry about one other people I'd thank you what you're supposed to do

889
01:29:21.10 --> 01:29:26.78
at what point did you I what point did you did you link up with the with the DAV

890
01:29:26.78 --> 01:29:32.70
well the DAV initially gave me what they call a complementary membership all Vietnam

891
01:29:32.70 --> 01:29:40.62
era veterans that were injured got that that was in 1970 and then I moved from Minnesota to Florida

892
01:29:40.62 --> 01:29:48.38
in March of 1971 and my wife at the time said what are you going to do about that membership in the DAV

893
01:29:48.38 --> 01:29:54.14
and I said you know I really hadn't given it much thought I was busy with with the job that I'd

894
01:29:54.14 --> 01:29:59.90
moved there for and I know she looked it up I think when time said well there's a chapter in

895
01:29:59.90 --> 01:30:06.70
Sanford so I actually started going welcome me with open arms it was a nice friendly group of people

896
01:30:06.70 --> 01:30:14.38
and I mean it it was a great great great great relationship with them and I needed that so maybe

897
01:30:14.38 --> 01:30:21.90
she was even smarter than I was to recognize that it's nice to be able to go back and associate

898
01:30:21.90 --> 01:30:28.30
with other disabled veterans because you're actually there to lift that person up and bring them

899
01:30:28.30 --> 01:30:33.34
along and they're there to do the same thing for you you can be an inspiration great not maybe

900
01:30:33.34 --> 01:30:39.58
you can be inspired by somebody that's there so that's my initial strong involvement on the

901
01:30:39.58 --> 01:30:47.34
local chapter level was in Sanford Florida Seminal chapter 30 and then just stayed involved constantly

902
01:30:47.34 --> 01:30:53.10
I mean you know we're 50 years this year DAV is going to celebrate their 100th anniversary

903
01:30:53.10 --> 01:30:59.02
I'm going to celebrate my 50th anniversary being a member of the DAV now you mentioned that

904
01:30:59.66 --> 01:31:04.94
in that whole thing that you had begun married at some point where here was that I got married in

905
01:31:04.94 --> 01:31:14.14
February 1970 to a young lady that I met in the community of Denver, Colorado so that was that was

906
01:31:14.14 --> 01:31:20.94
while you were at Fitt Simmons no I was home okay matter when I was at Fitt Simmons got married back

907
01:31:20.94 --> 01:31:26.62
in Rochester Minnesota got it and then did you you did you ended up having kids with her two children

908
01:31:26.62 --> 01:31:37.02
two two boys we're now 44 or 45 and 43 years old that's awesome then you moved up through the ranks

909
01:31:37.02 --> 01:31:42.38
of the DAV correct well I did a lot of stuff in the local chapter then I got involved on the

910
01:31:42.38 --> 01:31:47.34
department level which is what we call our state organizations became an officer in the state

911
01:31:48.06 --> 01:31:54.38
went through all the chairs and became you know a department commander and then obviously people who had

912
01:31:54.38 --> 01:32:01.74
been in the national organization before recognize it maybe I could be a national officer asked me if I

913
01:32:01.74 --> 01:32:07.90
would consider doing that so in 1999 I initially got elected to what we call the fourth junior

914
01:32:07.90 --> 01:32:15.26
vice commander the beginning of your working your way up to be a national commander so now we're talking

915
01:32:15.26 --> 01:32:28.38
1999 where were you on on September 11th 2001 I was home in a popga and what did that when you saw that

916
01:32:29.42 --> 01:32:33.42
I mean obviously you must have heard the word drums like everybody else what were what were you thinking

917
01:32:33.42 --> 01:32:39.50
I mean almost unbelievable to begin with that could ever happen here on American soil

918
01:32:40.38 --> 01:32:45.74
and then I don't know where I was originally but then my wife had hollered to me and

919
01:32:45.74 --> 01:32:50.46
and the plane was at the second building by the time I got front of the television and I mean

920
01:32:51.42 --> 01:32:57.50
we knew it was real I mean it's it's a shock to think that anything like that can happen in two buildings full of

921
01:32:57.50 --> 01:33:05.26
people just unbelievable now did you immediately I mean we were in an afghanistan

922
01:33:06.30 --> 01:33:11.26
bi October when you think in yourself where there's war there's gonna be wounded

923
01:33:12.38 --> 01:33:19.82
and the DAV and year you know you talked about how much it helped you to meet somebody that was a triple

924
01:33:19.82 --> 01:33:25.26
ampute two months before you three months before you they didn't even have much experience with it

925
01:33:25.26 --> 01:33:30.78
but it was enough to make you say okay if they can make it I can make it did you think to yourself

926
01:33:31.42 --> 01:33:36.94
here we go again I don't know whether I ever came to that conclusion that early on

927
01:33:37.50 --> 01:33:41.10
but as you know it didn't take long before we started getting wounded back

928
01:33:41.98 --> 01:33:49.34
and as long as I was a national officer I always asked if I could go up to DC and spend a day or two

929
01:33:49.34 --> 01:33:54.70
so I could go through wall to read and spend time visiting young men and women coming back from

930
01:33:54.70 --> 01:34:01.42
Iraq and Afghanistan so I look forward to having that opportunity to do that and one of the

931
01:34:01.42 --> 01:34:08.22
guys I mean this is fast forwarding some but a young man came back at injured in September of 2004

932
01:34:08.78 --> 01:34:14.22
and he was also a triple ampute he lost both legs and an arm and you because of the hip

933
01:34:14.22 --> 01:34:20.14
a law as you had to go through and get permission to visit people in the hospital well he had originally

934
01:34:20.14 --> 01:34:26.22
been on our list and then he'd scratched the DAV off of that because they were kind of getting

935
01:34:26.22 --> 01:34:32.46
tired of politicians just coming into in photo ops with seriously injured vets so he kind of thought

936
01:34:32.46 --> 01:34:37.90
that's what it was well we were visiting another young guy there was a single leg amputee on the

937
01:34:39.66 --> 01:34:45.98
physical therapy ward and he was in a bed maybe 15 feet away so he called the officer over that

938
01:34:45.98 --> 01:34:51.74
was with us and said who the hell's that guy said well that's the guy was going to come to visit

939
01:34:51.74 --> 01:34:57.98
and goes oh hell I'll see him you know because we were we were one in the same so my wife was with

940
01:34:57.98 --> 01:35:02.38
me on that trip as well too so we went over to the bed when we finished with this first young man

941
01:35:02.94 --> 01:35:07.74
and talked you're a little bit and it's not a matter that you're going to be doing any great

942
01:35:07.74 --> 01:35:15.02
wonderful pep talk it's kind of just more a matter of explaining I'm just exactly like you were

943
01:35:15.02 --> 01:35:22.78
I've been in that bed it was back in in you know 1969 I've been through a lot of difficulties but

944
01:35:22.78 --> 01:35:28.54
you're going to be okay you're alive his mother and his fiance were standing at the end of the bed

945
01:35:28.54 --> 01:35:34.30
and my wife was talking to them and I truly believe that she was probably more inspirational and

946
01:35:34.30 --> 01:35:41.98
more informative to them than I ever was with him in that one initial meeting he'd after we'd

947
01:35:41.98 --> 01:35:47.90
have to see each other multiple times as he started to grow a little bit and get out of bed and get

948
01:35:47.90 --> 01:35:54.46
into a wheelchair where he pretty well understands he is going to be okay it is going to be better

949
01:35:54.46 --> 01:36:00.30
and today which is I don't know how many years ago is that 25 or something maybe more than that

950
01:36:00.30 --> 01:36:07.82
he's college educated got a wife two children hugely successful and you know I could probably

951
01:36:07.82 --> 01:36:12.86
say well part of that was my inspiration but I think part of that was the grit he was raised with

952
01:36:12.86 --> 01:36:18.06
the kid from Michigan as well too he was probably going to be okay no matter what happened but

953
01:36:18.06 --> 01:36:25.18
you know to see him do that makes me feel extremely good that younger generation is picking up on

954
01:36:25.18 --> 01:36:30.54
that and they're moving forward and getting along with their lives as well too yeah no that's

955
01:36:30.54 --> 01:36:39.02
yeah that's that's unbelievable I mean obviously you might not feel like you may feel like

956
01:36:39.02 --> 01:36:44.86
you would have done it anyways but you know anything that you do in life when you see that someone

957
01:36:44.86 --> 01:36:49.90
else has done it and and you know it's possible I mean that's so much of the battle right there

958
01:36:49.90 --> 01:36:55.02
is just knowing that something can be done and for someone to look at you and see that you got

959
01:36:55.02 --> 01:37:02.30
kids and you got wife and you got business and you got damn apartment complexes and whatnot and

960
01:37:02.30 --> 01:37:10.06
you carry you carry on for someone that's however old 19 20 23 years old and say okay I've been

961
01:37:10.06 --> 01:37:17.90
putting this rough spot but I can but I can do this he did it if he did it I can do it that's a

962
01:37:17.90 --> 01:37:30.62
man that's that's that's worth it's weight and gold is there anything that that we can do to help

963
01:37:30.62 --> 01:37:38.78
out the the DAV anything that just people that are listening to the show that that recognize the

964
01:37:38.78 --> 01:37:44.06
the benefits that that the DAV provides what's the best thing for people to do to support it

965
01:37:44.06 --> 01:37:48.38
well I mean I think there's a lot of different things in their local community there's

966
01:37:48.38 --> 01:37:54.78
opportunities at local chapters there's a department level donations to our national organization

967
01:37:54.78 --> 01:38:00.94
that allow us to continue to do great things every single day I think the numbers we're talking

968
01:38:00.94 --> 01:38:08.78
about right now is we provide service to over a million veterans every single year and it may not

969
01:38:08.78 --> 01:38:13.98
be the same service of service work when the claims representation it might be transportation

970
01:38:13.98 --> 01:38:18.94
to and from VA medical centers for guys that don't have a way to get there for their doctors

971
01:38:18.94 --> 01:38:25.74
appointments they might we might be volunteers and hospitals we can use help in all those areas

972
01:38:25.74 --> 01:38:36.06
from the American public so the the website is DAV.org they're actually quite high speed on their

973
01:38:36.06 --> 01:38:43.66
social media they have Twitter which is at DAV HQ they have Instagram which is also at DAV

974
01:38:43.66 --> 01:38:51.10
HQ and then they have Facebook which is just at DAV and anyone can get on there they have

975
01:38:51.10 --> 01:38:56.14
pretty good you know it's pretty simple to figure out how you can help how you can volunteer

976
01:38:56.14 --> 01:39:03.98
how you can donate to that to that awesome cause and you know I started off this podcast with

977
01:39:03.98 --> 01:39:11.02
a quote from you when you were talking about how lucky you were and and even just before we before

978
01:39:11.02 --> 01:39:17.66
we pressed record today you were you were explaining you were just saying to me you know you've

979
01:39:17.66 --> 01:39:25.74
had this life that you wouldn't trade any part of it and I think anybody that's that's listening

980
01:39:27.02 --> 01:39:34.22
to you seeing you talk here you talk to have that attitude and maintain that attitude that is

981
01:39:34.22 --> 01:39:39.26
that is the most powerful thing that a person can have for you to be in the situation that you

982
01:39:39.26 --> 01:39:49.98
were in 90 pounds lost both your legs lost your arm and to get up and move forward I mean that

983
01:39:49.98 --> 01:39:57.10
that mentality is it's it's it's unbelievable it's it's it's it's miraculous and it's and it's

984
01:39:57.10 --> 01:40:08.62
it's inspirational when you look back now do you ever feel do you feel like this was the way it was

985
01:40:08.62 --> 01:40:16.78
meant to be well I think because of my faith in God I believe that nothing happens to you that

986
01:40:16.78 --> 01:40:23.82
that he doesn't think you can handle that's the way I prayed my entire life is it is not I don't

987
01:40:23.82 --> 01:40:28.78
praise so that I wake up tomorrow morning and I've got two legs in an arm I pray that I have the

988
01:40:28.78 --> 01:40:34.14
same opportunity tomorrow that I had today or maybe maybe something more I can do tomorrow not

989
01:40:34.14 --> 01:40:41.02
so much but I'm asking for something so I think really truly the best thing that I can say is

990
01:40:41.02 --> 01:40:49.34
my injury is from the neck down but my ability to continue on is from the neck up it's it's the

991
01:40:49.34 --> 01:40:56.22
way you think and what you want to do is again from the neck up if somebody said well how in the

992
01:40:56.22 --> 01:41:02.62
world can you have a a roofing company well that's really easy I don't get on the roof you

993
01:41:02.62 --> 01:41:08.14
mean that doesn't look like that be a whole lot of fun it's easier for me to get customers do the

994
01:41:08.14 --> 01:41:15.42
estimates and do the money part of it and and hire people that do the work so but I never looked at

995
01:41:15.42 --> 01:41:20.70
that said well you can't do that if you're missing two legs in arm sure you can you can do anything

996
01:41:20.70 --> 01:41:26.46
if you're missing two legs in arm anybody out there are DAV members or anybody that sustain any

997
01:41:26.46 --> 01:41:32.06
form of an injury that wants to give up I'm just here to tell you you don't need to give up don't

998
01:41:32.06 --> 01:41:39.74
ever give up there's a challenge out they're just accept a challenge and move forward well I don't

999
01:41:39.74 --> 01:41:48.06
think I have anything else to say after that you got anything else that's the floor is yours

1000
01:41:49.26 --> 01:41:53.98
I just want to thank you again I know we did it the beginning of the podcast but thank you

1001
01:41:53.98 --> 01:42:02.54
for the opportunity for allowing DAV and meet a commissar representative to be on the program with you I hope

1002
01:42:02.54 --> 01:42:07.42
we got millions of people out there that heard the podcast or will hear it in the future and that

1003
01:42:07.42 --> 01:42:11.98
they'll remember that the DAV is if they're a veteran it's there for them and their family and

1004
01:42:11.98 --> 01:42:16.54
dependents if they're a member of the American public that would just like to reach out and do

1005
01:42:16.54 --> 01:42:23.26
something to help their fellow disabled veterans you can get all the DAV.org just like you mentioned

1006
01:42:23.26 --> 01:42:27.42
before we would welcome the opportunity you would come to us and offer to help.

1007
01:42:28.86 --> 01:42:36.14
Well I'm sure that folks will definitely do that and I know you're thinking me for having you out

1008
01:42:36.14 --> 01:42:43.10
here but this is it's absolutely honor for me to be able to sit here and talk with you and thank you

on the show and thank you for everything thank you Jack will appreciate it and with that

1015
01:43:30.78 --> 01:43:42.14
Mr. Sersley has left the building how does that man not change your attitude about just about

1016
01:43:42.14 --> 01:43:46.94
everything that you do all the day to day basis yeah oh yeah big time and he said something

1017
01:43:47.58 --> 01:43:54.14
that kind of this is real small but I was like it's different when you're talking about um how

1018
01:43:54.14 --> 01:43:59.66
or when he was talking about how he didn't drink and do that and his that's all call it so

1019
01:43:59.66 --> 01:44:04.78
that's like that's not just oh yeah I just didn't but the way he said it was this he was like

1020
01:44:06.14 --> 01:44:11.66
I knew that that wasn't a path I was going to go go down right but then he said and I want to kind

1021
01:44:11.66 --> 01:44:16.86
of let I'm paraphrasing obviously I want to let everyone know that you don't you don't have to give up

1022
01:44:16.86 --> 01:44:21.02
or something he said he didn't say don't give up like a bit this big thing it's like he said

1023
01:44:21.02 --> 01:44:26.78
you don't need to give up do kind of thing because it when my mind anyway it seemed like

1024
01:44:26.78 --> 01:44:33.90
like like giving up seems like such a viable option you know yeah for sure and these like oh no

1025
01:44:33.90 --> 01:44:37.50
you don't need to do that you don't need to do that like kind of like no you can actually do this

1026
01:44:37.50 --> 01:44:43.58
other thing kind of thing like he made it sound so casual what almost like hey it's almost like

1027
01:44:43.58 --> 01:44:49.74
he he reversed it all the way back down to the bare decision making of it you know rather than like

1028
01:44:49.74 --> 01:44:54.70
oh there's hard battle or whatever it's hard battle 100% but that's not what he was focusing on

1029
01:44:54.70 --> 01:44:59.18
the way he said it that's what it sounded like you know like all men that's kind of an interesting sort

1030
01:44:59.18 --> 01:45:05.98
of way to present it yeah you don't need to give up sometimes we stop record to you because you

1031
01:45:05.98 --> 01:45:12.94
just told a really cool story about the fact that his first sergeant was telling him hey

1032
01:45:14.06 --> 01:45:20.14
if you stay in you get a $10,000 realness component and a brand new Corvette which you can order

1033
01:45:20.14 --> 01:45:28.54
here we'll get delivered to your house for $5,500 and you know what he said hey hey listen

1034
01:45:28.54 --> 01:45:35.98
for sergeant there's people here trying to kill me if I'm good so well by my own Corvette when

1035
01:45:35.98 --> 01:45:42.54
I get home so you know and that's when you when you hear a guy like him you just realize that

1036
01:45:42.54 --> 01:45:51.58
there's so much more that we're capable of overcoming and and he's singing he's lucky and it's just

1037
01:45:52.14 --> 01:45:59.10
if he's lucky to be here we're all lucky to be here and what we need to do is make sure we take

1038
01:45:59.10 --> 01:46:07.10
advantage of the opportunities that we have getting our attitude straight

1039
01:46:07.10 --> 01:46:14.22
being on the path staying on the path so echo Charles speaking to the path yes what can we do

1040
01:46:14.86 --> 01:46:24.14
well as we always talk about first two just two we can do two we're at victory MMA in the main

1041
01:46:24.14 --> 01:46:31.66
where we call this corridor we call it a corridor we're in the kind of lounge this is the lounge area

1042
01:46:31.66 --> 01:46:36.54
oddly enough I have to admit that I have a lounge area in my gym right instead of having more

1043
01:46:36.54 --> 01:46:41.98
squat racks still in case you got a lounge area yeah this is the echo Charles lounge area

1044
01:46:41.98 --> 01:46:46.38
I prefer to call it the recovery area okay so anyways we got nice couches

1058
01:48:15.90 --> 01:48:21.18
them yeah it's not a good idea join warfare cruel oil combo my suggestion recommendation

1059
01:48:21.18 --> 01:48:26.06
strong repetition recommendation uh one more thing we've got right now so we have discipline

1060
01:48:26.06 --> 01:48:33.58
in a powder form and it's sort of like a pre mission cognitive and physical enhancement

1061
01:48:33.58 --> 01:48:41.02
so we just came out with a new flavor the new flavor is called jaccopommer it's 50% iced tea

1062
01:48:41.02 --> 01:48:48.94
50% lemonade and it's really really really good it's in fact it's all I'm drinking right now

1063
01:48:48.94 --> 01:48:55.82
unless I'm having a discipline going to can wait so the the one you have the jaccopommer that's

1064
01:48:55.82 --> 01:49:01.50
the powder one yeah it's not just when go it's discipline yes and discipline go in a can

1065
01:49:01.50 --> 01:49:07.98
jaccopommer is coming okay we're gonna cover all the bases we also got dac savage

1066
01:49:07.98 --> 01:49:16.46
what is that that's another quote of Myers decoda Myers custom what no no no wait better

1067
01:49:16.46 --> 01:49:25.58
a signature signature signature from decoda what flavor the flavor is called cherry vanilla

1068
01:49:25.58 --> 01:49:32.46
which if you know anything about flavors that's basically a doctor pepper what okay so it's

1069
01:49:32.46 --> 01:49:40.54
sedax savage is the name of the flavor yes discipline from decoda Myers that tastes like

1070
01:49:40.54 --> 01:49:46.30
doctor pepper decoda Myers signature signature flavor yeah signature flavor so anyways I'm coming

1071
01:49:46.30 --> 01:49:52.70
out to the next and we all got milk for your protein or you can call it protein or you can just

1072
01:49:52.70 --> 01:49:56.94
call it dessert dessert I do prefer to call dessert because that's basically what it tastes like

1073
01:49:57.74 --> 01:50:04.46
do would you ever and and this thought flashed in my head last night almost almost not going to

1074
01:50:04.46 --> 01:50:07.98
admit it but I'm gonna tell you because you know I've known you for a long time so it trust you

1075
01:50:08.86 --> 01:50:14.78
so I had a little thing of leftover rocky road ice cream not for me it was it was my son's birthday

1076
01:50:14.78 --> 01:50:20.22
a while back and so far my wife did not want to get my bunch of you know sugar well there was

1077
01:50:20.22 --> 01:50:25.58
a lot left we didn't eat that much but so I busted it out left him on the counter can I eat

1078
01:50:25.58 --> 01:50:31.02
some and sort of forgot about it in my whatever it melted oh but it's in the what he called I don't

1079
01:50:31.02 --> 01:50:36.54
know if it's a pint the be the one but you have to figure the half count yeah coming in hot so I'm

1080
01:50:36.54 --> 01:50:44.30
like all right whatever so for milk shit involuntary milk shit so I'm pounding this rocky road ice

1081
01:50:44.30 --> 01:50:50.22
cream milkshake out of the container by the way it's nighttime nobody saw but I'm pounding

1082
01:50:50.22 --> 01:50:54.06
Martian there's a little marshmallows in there little nuts what's in rockerwood like almond or

1083
01:50:54.06 --> 01:51:00.70
no almond or walnut yeah we're doing it some kind of nuts yeah nuts yeah and marshmallow

1084
01:51:00.70 --> 01:51:06.78
yeah and all soft now anyway it's not bad it was good did you put milk in there but I'm thinking

1085
01:51:06.78 --> 01:51:12.30
no it didn't see I could but it would sort of what it did but what if you put marshmallows and nuts

1086
01:51:12.30 --> 01:51:17.34
in mock you could do that it'd kind of be the same thing I don't like marshmallows by the way yeah

1087
01:51:17.34 --> 01:51:22.94
I don't either I don't like marshmallows I don't like any marshmallows except let's face it

1088
01:51:22.94 --> 01:51:27.90
whatever those kinds of marshmallows are that are in lucky charms right right right right right

1089
01:51:27.90 --> 01:51:32.62
oh yeah those things when I was a kid I was I was all about those lucky charms and the crazy thing

1090
01:51:32.62 --> 01:51:38.54
is it was just normal you just Saturday morning this is a thing you used to be a thing cartoons

1091
01:51:38.54 --> 01:51:42.54
Saturday morning that's what that's what kids did yeah those lucky charms marshmallows are

1092
01:51:42.54 --> 01:51:47.66
so they're kind of odd because like I mean I guess hey if you dig on my dig it but those the dehydrated

1093
01:51:47.66 --> 01:51:51.82
ones when you eat them you get the you know that like nails against the chalkboard feeling on the

1094
01:51:51.82 --> 01:51:55.42
Chomp those dehydrated mushrooms you know I would probably I probably haven't had any of that since I was

1095
01:51:55.42 --> 01:51:59.66
in Iraq it's really the last time I had some lucky charms like there was some box in the

1096
01:51:59.66 --> 01:52:05.58
whatever yeah I don't know man I was like you can't dig it so cinnamon toast cr- I think

1097
01:52:05.58 --> 01:52:09.42
that cinnamon toast crunch back and then I think that was like the weakness cereal one oh you know

1098
01:52:09.42 --> 01:52:13.66
this is bad but it's I think we might have just gotten off track because we're talking about lucky

1099
01:52:13.66 --> 01:52:17.10
charms and cinnamon crunch yeah that is not on the path that's what we're talking about yeah

1100
01:52:17.10 --> 01:52:22.54
smoke additional protein taste delicious and for kids instead of feeding your kids cereal or

1101
01:52:22.54 --> 01:52:27.10
rocky road ice cream give if you would have told your son heck that's your birthday here's a

1102

1208
02:03:25.10 --> 02:03:33.02
with such men and women who have given so much and yet they continue to give and to all the other

1209
02:03:33.02 --> 02:03:38.22
veterans out there to those that have served and those that are serving and those that are holding

1210
02:03:38.22 --> 02:03:46.78
the line as we speak thanks to each one of you for fighting for our freedom and to our police and

1211
02:03:46.78 --> 02:03:52.46
law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers

1212
02:03:52.46 --> 02:04:00.62
and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders each of you work so hard and give

so much to keep us safe here at home so thanks to all of you as well for your service and to everyone

1214
02:04:07.90 --> 02:04:16.22
else out there you just heard another example of what the human will is capable of

1215
02:04:16.22 --> 02:04:27.50
and even when facing the most unimaginable challenges even when ripped apart by a bomb

1216
02:04:27.50 --> 02:04:38.06
the will to live and the will to fight and the will to overcome is unstoppable and what that

1217
02:04:38.06 --> 02:04:54.30
makes me wonder what are we capable of what are we capable of if we summoned the kind of will that

1218
02:04:54.30 --> 02:05:06.14
Jim certainly has are we doing everything right now that we are capable of doing are we reaching

1219
02:05:06.14 --> 02:05:22.30
our potential how much more could we do how much more could we do there's only one way to find out

1220
02:05:22.30 --> 02:05:28.70
and that is to step up into the breach to put yourself out there every day and do everything you

1221
02:05:28.70 --> 02:05:44.62
possibly can to get after it and until next time this is echo and jacco out
