00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.72
This is Jocco podcast, number 13, with Echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:14.72 --> 00:00:29.96
This is extracted from US Army FM-3106-2.11, combined arms operations in urban terrain.

3
00:00:29.96 --> 00:00:39.96
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the people of Chechnya began to seek full independence.

4
00:00:39.96 --> 00:00:48.96
By 1994, Chechnya had fallen into civil war between pro-independence and pro-Russian factions.

5
00:00:48.96 --> 00:00:56.80
In December 1994, Russia sent 40,000 troops into Chechnya to restore Russian primacy over the breakaway

6
00:00:56.80 --> 00:00:57.80
republic.

7
00:00:57.80 --> 00:01:05.80
At attack was launched by 6,000 mechanized troops against the Chechnya capital of Grosni.

8
00:01:05.80 --> 00:01:18.80
Instead of the anticipated light resistance, Russian forces encountered heavy resistance from the Chechnya's armed with massive amounts of anti-tank weapons.

9
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:30.80
The Russians were repulsed with shockingly high losses. It took them another two months of heavy fighting and changing their tactics before they were able to capture Grosni.

10
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:46.80
Between January and May 1995, Russian losses in Chechnya were approximately 2,800 killed, 10,000 wounded, and over 500 missing or captured.

11
00:01:46.80 --> 00:01:53.80
The Chechnya casualties were also high, especially among non-combatants.

12
00:01:53.80 --> 00:02:07.80
This war is a major and cautionary episode in military history. The large scale lessons of Chechnya lie in these areas.

13
00:02:07.80 --> 00:02:25.80
It showed again the limited effectiveness of heavy weaponry in urban terrain and by extension the crucial importance of well-trained, well-led, well-equipped and highly motivated infantry.

14
00:02:25.80 --> 00:02:39.80
It proved again that a society-judged primitive or chaotic by Western standards can still generate a tremendous fighting spirit and very effective military discipline.

15
00:02:39.80 --> 00:02:45.80
This is not a new lesson.

16
00:02:45.80 --> 00:02:59.80
It's a little introduction to the focus for today, and that's this Soviet attack on Chechnya, the Breakaway Republic.

17
00:02:59.80 --> 00:03:12.80
It's just urban combat. That's what I found it very fascinating. I remember at the first time I started to...

18
00:03:12.80 --> 00:03:20.80
The first significant moment when I remembered hearing about the lessons learned from Chechnya.

19
00:03:20.80 --> 00:03:34.80
You watch it, we all watched it. I was in the military at the time. But the first time I remember hearing about the lessons learned was actually when I was going through Officer Candidate School in 1998.

20
00:03:34.80 --> 00:03:56.80
For whatever reason, one of the Marine Corps drill instructors had put this series of lessons learned of the Russian military up on the wall. And this is something I talk about occasionally is that the lesson that I remembered seeing there was that it was when they stopped shaving.

21
00:03:56.80 --> 00:04:07.80
When the Russian troops stopped shaving, it was like the beginning of the end. Discipline fell apart, morale fell apart, and everything turned into a disaster. There weren't a bunch of other lessons.

22
00:04:07.80 --> 00:04:18.80
I've looked for that specific document, and I haven't been able to find it. I don't know what the specific document was that said that, but I found others that are close to that.

23
00:04:18.80 --> 00:04:37.80
But what's interesting is that now, and this field manual, this Army Field Manual, that I'm reading from, was actually published in 2002. So we had definitely looked at this war, and it was brutal.

24
00:04:37.80 --> 00:05:04.80
And if you want to go into some dark places, you can go into some dark places, because this is one of the first, it definitely is one of the first where you had information warfare happening, meaning there was propaganda coming out, home made propaganda, you can see it on YouTube, especially from the Cheshire side of just brutal, brutal behavior.

25
00:05:04.80 --> 00:05:14.80
And they were doing that purposely to strike fear into the hearts of the Russian soldiers, and they were effective in doing that. They did do that.

26
00:05:14.80 --> 00:05:23.80
Yeah, it's crazy how they make those videos, just available to everybody. They do. It is crazy.

27
00:05:23.80 --> 00:05:44.80
So as we dig into this a little bit, this is still from within the FM-3106, but they're quoting lessons learned from the world turned upside down, military lessons of the Cheshire war by Mr. Anatol Leaven.

28
00:05:44.80 --> 00:05:54.80
And he said, it cannot be emphasized too strongly, therefore, that the key to success in urban warfare is good infantry.

29
00:05:54.80 --> 00:06:11.80
And the key to good infantry, rather than good weaponry, is a traditional mixture of training, leadership qualities and NGOs and junior grade officers and morale in applying readiness to take casualties.

30
00:06:11.80 --> 00:06:26.80
So this is classic, this is what we, this is what Romadi was all about as well. You know, good infantry, which they absolutely had great NCO leadership, which they absolutely had, the junior officers were outstanding.

31
00:06:26.80 --> 00:06:40.80
The morale, which he says the morale is already missed to take casualties, and you know, that's one of the things that no doubt about it Colonel Sean McFarlane, that was running the brigade.

32
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:50.80
He had to overcome that fear that many people had, which was when you push into these enemy control territories, you are going to take casualties.

33
00:06:50.80 --> 00:07:08.80
It is going to happen, you cannot avoid it, and that's something that we seals had to deal with as well, because seals had been in, had been in Iraq for three years at this point, and not had any seals killed in action.

34
00:07:08.80 --> 00:07:22.80
So this idea that we're going to push into this heavy urban fighting meant to us, we were going to, we were going to take casualties at some point.

35
00:07:22.80 --> 00:07:41.80
The US, back to the book, the US will not always have the ability to pick and choose its wars, and the key reason, Cheshne is that there will always be military actions in which a determined infantryman will remain the greatest asset.

36
00:07:41.80 --> 00:08:03.80
And that is very near-endured my heart, knowing that it's not the technology, the drones, it's not the aircraft, it's the infantryman, it's the soldier that makes the difference, and the leader, the leaders of those soldiers that make the difference.

37
00:08:03.80 --> 00:08:17.80
Now, here was the Marine Corps analysis. First of all strategic lessons, military operations alone cannot solve deep-seated political problems.

38
00:08:17.80 --> 00:08:45.80
Okay, military commanders need clear policy guidance from which they could work steadily and logically. Confusion generated by missing or conflicting policy guidance is made worse by poorly defined lines of command and control. So those first two messages right there are all about clear guidance.

39
00:08:45.80 --> 00:08:56.80
And this happens all the time in the business world where you don't see clear guidance making it all the way down to the front lines of the Jena Command.

40
00:08:56.80 --> 00:09:20.80
Russian senior command lacked continuity and was plagued by too much senior leadership involvement at the lower operational level.

41
00:09:20.80 --> 00:09:30.80
When Russian security operations began achieving results, the Cheshien started attacking targets within Russia.

42
00:09:30.80 --> 00:09:40.80
It was difficult to unite police and military units into a single cohesive force.

43
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:52.80
Distinct tactical advantages accrue to the side with less concern for the safety of the civilian population. That is something that we absolutely dealt with in Ramadi.

44
00:09:52.80 --> 00:10:12.80
Again, it's that the distinct tactical advantage accrue to the side with less concern for the safety of the civilian population. This was of utmost concern to every soldier and marine on the ground in Ramadi was trying to protect the civilian population.

45
00:10:12.80 --> 00:10:27.80
And of course, the alkyd and surgeons that we are facing did not care and all about the civilian population or any their buildings or any their their lives or children or women or anything else.

46
00:10:27.80 --> 00:10:48.80
What we are talking about civilian casualties and property destruction declined as casualties among Russian forces rose. So initially the Russians were also concerned about civilian casualties, but as they started taking casualties got worse and worse.

47
00:10:48.80 --> 00:11:00.80
Here are some operational lessons. Having well developed military doctrine for urban warfare is not enough in and of itself.

48
00:11:00.80 --> 00:11:03.80
Got to have that creativity.

49
00:11:03.80 --> 00:11:16.80
The doctrine does not answer everything. Situation oriented training would have improved Russian military effectiveness and we're going to talk about that later today, but situation oriented training.

50
00:11:16.80 --> 00:11:32.80
And that is when you put yourself in situations and you make people have to think it's not about executing pretty plan moves. It's just like in martial arts. It's not about being able to do a cada and do a movement.

51
00:11:32.80 --> 00:11:43.80
That's not what it's about. It's about reacting to another free thinking human being and in this case a group of free thinking human beings. How do you react in those situations?

52
00:11:43.80 --> 00:11:50.80
And there are specific situations as well. Right. Like those situations like in Gigi to do situational training that would be like okay here half guard.

53
00:11:50.80 --> 00:11:59.80
If you get on top, you know you start all over. If you, you know, tap the guy would start all over in half guard. Start all over in half guard.

54
00:11:59.80 --> 00:12:08.80
In adequate training in the most basic maneuver and combat skills inhibited Russian operations.

55
00:12:08.80 --> 00:12:23.80
So you've got to be trained up in the basics, no doubt about it. Urban combat is extremely manpower intensive and produces significant attrition of men and material among the attackers.

56
00:12:23.80 --> 00:12:40.80
Overwhelming firepower can make up for organizational and tactical deficiencies in the short run. If one is willing to disregard collateral damage. So yeah, you can just bomb bomb the crap out of places.

57
00:12:40.80 --> 00:12:51.80
And you can make up for your tactical and organizational problems in the short run. If you don't care about a collateral damage, you know, this is we, we, we don't do that.

58
00:12:51.80 --> 00:12:57.80
We as Americans don't do that. You care about collateral damage.

59
00:12:57.80 --> 00:13:10.80
The sudden requirement to deploy to Cheshania coupled with the unique supply problems posed by the weather and the urban environment overwhelmed the already fragile Russian military logistics system.

60
00:13:10.80 --> 00:13:18.80
And these are just bullet points. By the way, if the sounds still did the way I'm reading it, I'm just reading bullet after bullet.

61
00:13:18.80 --> 00:13:27.80
The lack of high quality intelligence made operations more difficult and dangerous on the Russian forces.

62
00:13:27.80 --> 00:13:37.80
The geometry and perspectives of urban combat are very different from combat in the open. Urban combat is much more vertically oriented.

63
00:13:37.80 --> 00:13:59.80
In, in the desert, you do have elevation. You know, you have hills, mountains, whatever. So there is some vertically oriented things that you have to deal with, but an urban combat every, you know, every foot can be separated by 10 stores, you know, and so it is a 360 degree environment.

64
00:13:59.80 --> 00:14:14.80
You get subterranean situations. You have basements. You have sellers. You have underground sewers and pipes and things tunnels that go from building to building. So it's a 360 degree environment for sure.

65
00:14:14.80 --> 00:14:24.80
Fratricide was a serious and continuing problem throughout the campaign in Cheshania because it was difficult to tell friend from fo.

66
00:14:24.80 --> 00:14:33.80
That's friendly fire. That's friendly fire. And this is, you know, obviously in our book.

67
00:14:33.80 --> 00:14:45.80
I start off, I mean, the first chapter is about a fratricide that happens. So obviously we learned this, you know, in the most horrible way.

68
00:14:45.80 --> 00:14:57.80
And anybody that's been in hardcore urban combat and again, I'm not talking about doing an operation with let's say one unit against a bad guy in an urban environment.

69
00:14:57.80 --> 00:15:13.80
I'm talking about urban combat where you have multiple units all over the place friendly units in buildings on roads and their mixed in. There's no way can help with their mixed in with enemy.

70
00:15:13.80 --> 00:15:26.80
And it becomes very, very challenging. Standard Russian military unit configurations were inappropriate for urban combat.

71
00:15:26.80 --> 00:15:39.80
For going peacetime maintenance is a false economy. So there's something to think about going peacetime maintenance for good when you say, you know what, there's nothing going on right now.

72
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:50.80
We'll just kind of slack off. You know what, I don't need to train in the off season. Right. I don't need to prepare right now. Guess what you do. You do need to prepare right now.

73
00:15:50.80 --> 00:15:55.80
It's, it's a lie to think you're going to get away with it.

74
00:15:55.80 --> 00:16:06.80
The potential of special forces for urban operations was never realized in Cheshania. Well, we realized it in Ramadi for sure and how to work it.

75
00:16:06.80 --> 00:16:15.80
Nature of cities tends to channel combat operations along narrow lanes of activity. That's just a dummy. That's what they're called roads.

76
00:16:15.80 --> 00:16:27.80
And just like when you're in downtown San Diego, in the gas lamp district, guess what things are channeled along to long narrow long narrow lanes of activity. It's called a road.

77
00:16:27.80 --> 00:16:31.80
That's kind of an obvious one.

78
00:16:31.80 --> 00:16:34.80
Tactical lessons.

79
00:16:34.80 --> 00:16:42.80
Communication security is essential even against relatively primitive enemies. And this is what the Russians found out was that the the Cheshians,

80
00:16:42.80 --> 00:16:51.80
Many of whom spoke Russian, they were listening to radio calls. Listen to radio commands. They would, they would actually get on the radio and give false commands.

81
00:16:51.80 --> 00:17:03.80
So it was it was just a nightmare for them. Now in America, we have very highly sophisticated encryption systems. So this is really no factor for us.

82
00:17:03.80 --> 00:17:16.80
Night fighting was the single most difficult operation in Cheshania for infantry forces. Again, this is something that we are very good at. We being America.

83
00:17:16.80 --> 00:17:22.80
We are awesome at fighting at night. We have incredible capability on our night vision. We do it all the time.

84
00:17:22.80 --> 00:17:28.80
And actually that's that's worth mentioning the reason that we're good at it because we do it all the time. We train it all the time.

85
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:39.80
We do it all the time. And which is used to be in living in that way. We're used to living in that green world of night vision.

86
00:17:39.80 --> 00:17:47.80
Tanks and APCs cannot operate in cities without extensive dismounted infantry support.

87
00:17:47.80 --> 00:17:58.80
Now in Ramadi, they absolutely operated and they operated with a phenomenal success, but they did have an infantry support.

88
00:17:58.80 --> 00:18:08.80
Usually very close by. Although they were, they did push and do incredible operations on their own as well.

89
00:18:08.80 --> 00:18:17.80
Forces operating in cities need special equipment, not usually found in the Russian T O E, which is the basically the table of organization of equipment.

90
00:18:17.80 --> 00:18:23.80
The list of normal things that they had. Lightweight ladders were invaluable for assaulting infantry.

91
00:18:23.80 --> 00:18:31.80
This is all my first deployment to Iraq. We actually, we just built little ladders. We built little two by four ladders because there's walls all over the place.

92
00:18:31.80 --> 00:18:38.80
So we just have ladders, have them hooked on to hum these. When we eat them, we just pop them off.

93
00:18:38.80 --> 00:18:42.80
Yep, there was a spare one. We'll see by force.

94
00:18:42.80 --> 00:18:50.80
Train snipers were essential, but in short supply. We had plenty of snipers.

95
00:18:50.80 --> 00:18:57.80
Obscurants are especially useful when fighting in cities smoke grenades. And other ways of blocking vision.

96
00:18:57.80 --> 00:19:05.80
That's one of those things when when I was a kid in the SEAL teams and we would burn like, hey, you got a flow smoke and then once you fill the smoke, you can run away.

97
00:19:05.80 --> 00:19:10.80
And it almost seems like a joke almost.

98
00:19:10.80 --> 00:19:13.80
I mean, that almost sounds funny when I say that like Batman.

99
00:19:13.80 --> 00:19:18.80
Yeah, it's almost like Batman or James Bond. We've got little smoke button. It's freaking real.

100
00:19:18.80 --> 00:19:25.80
It's real. Like you flow that smoke out. You let that smoke start to pour out and then all of a sudden you can get out of there.

101
00:19:25.80 --> 00:19:33.80
And it's again, it's one of those things that it almost seems like a joke when you first hear about it when you're a kid.

102
00:19:33.80 --> 00:19:38.80
You're like, wait, really? That's a real thing. Really? No, that's a real thing.

103
00:19:38.80 --> 00:19:39.80
Yeah.

104
00:19:39.80 --> 00:19:43.80
Recovering damaged armored vehicles is especially difficult in cities.

105
00:19:43.80 --> 00:19:52.80
We absolutely learned that the insurgents took out dozens of tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles and homies.

106
00:19:52.80 --> 00:20:00.80
And it was always very difficult for the engineers to get in there and get those things out of there.

107
00:20:00.80 --> 00:20:16.80
A failure of small unit leadership, especially at the NCO level, was a primary cause of Russian tactical failures in Grasney.

108
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:24.80
So when you hear me say leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, that is what I am talking about.

109
00:20:24.80 --> 00:20:27.80
That is exactly what I am talking about.

110
00:20:27.80 --> 00:20:34.80
And it's the same thing in businesses. It's the same thing in teams and it's the same thing in life.

111
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:41.80
When we talk about leadership, we're not just talking about the overall person in jars, we're talking about leadership at every level.

112
00:20:41.80 --> 00:20:49.80
Both sides employed commercial off the shelf technologies for military purposes.

113
00:20:49.80 --> 00:20:51.80
Be ready for that.

114
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:59.80
In Ramadi, the enemy absolutely used, you know, Motorola, Waki-Takis, they had Motorola base stations set up.

115
00:20:59.80 --> 00:21:01.80
I mean, they were, they were using it.

116
00:21:01.80 --> 00:21:18.80
Tactical communications proved very difficult in Grasney. Again, you can't change the laws of physics and radio waves cannot punch through more than, you know, a couple to three buildings.

117
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:25.80
So once you get a couple to three buildings away, you're not going to be able to talk to the other units.

118
00:21:25.80 --> 00:21:40.80
You know, maybe four or five buildings. And the only way to do this is get on the rooftops. And so, you know, I was almost always on a rooftop because I was, you know, my main role was usually to make communications with the various troops that were out there army and my guys.

119
00:21:40.80 --> 00:21:47.80
And so I was almost always on a rooftop with a big old antenna sticking off my shoulder.

120
00:21:47.80 --> 00:21:56.80
And that's when, you know, when one of the guys needed to talk to me, they needed to go to the rooftop and they'd catch me.

121
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:02.80
The cabs of supplied trucks must be armored, no doubt about that.

122
00:22:02.80 --> 00:22:21.80
The bunker-busting weapons are invaluable for urban combat. This is something that we used a ton of was the Carl Gustav 84 millimeter. Big thunder.

123
00:22:21.80 --> 00:22:41.80
Helicopters are not well-suited for urban combat. And there's no doubt about that one. Again, in Ramadi, we found that any time helicopters came into Ramadi, they received so much small arms fire that they left immediately.

124
00:22:41.80 --> 00:22:47.80
It was just too hot for them to go into these situations.

125
00:22:47.80 --> 00:22:52.80
When a helicopter comes in, what does it take to take down a helicopter?

126
00:22:52.80 --> 00:22:57.80
I mean, you could take one round, right? It's almost like a human body. There's some sort of stuff.

127
00:22:57.80 --> 00:23:00.80
Oh, you could in the right spot. You could take it out.

128
00:23:00.80 --> 00:23:14.80
But, so it's really hard to put like an absolute on that. But, you know, generally, they can take some punishment, especially the Apache's, which are pretty well armored.

129
00:23:14.80 --> 00:23:24.80
But, they're not well armored enough to get in there, do what they would want to do. So they ended up just taking so many rounds that they could stay.

130
00:23:24.80 --> 00:23:28.80
Yeah, like if you hit in that little that rear propeller.

131
00:23:28.80 --> 00:23:36.80
Yeah, maybe. You hit it in the weak spot. There's going to be issues, which I won't talk about.

132
00:23:36.80 --> 00:23:46.80
All right, now we, that was the Marine Corps analysis. And again, this is all from the same manual. But I'm going to go into this. So they covered what the Marine Corps analysis had.

133
00:23:46.80 --> 00:23:53.80
And now this is the US Army infantry school analysis is Russian Army lessons learned from the battle of gravity.

134
00:23:53.80 --> 00:24:01.80
You need to culturally orient your forces so you don't end up being your own worst enemy simply out of cultural in ignorance.

135
00:24:01.80 --> 00:24:16.80
Many times Russian soldiers made serious cultural errors in dealing with the Cheshien civilians. Once insulted or mistreated, the Cheshien's became active fighters or at least supported the active fighters.

136
00:24:16.80 --> 00:24:30.80
Russians admit they underestimated they if the effective religion on the conflict. So you got to know your enemy. And you got to know your friends. And this is something that they definitely.

137
00:24:30.80 --> 00:24:45.80
They definitely make that important in the US military that you know you got to understand the local culture. And there was a true hero named Travis Patrickwin who we will have to do a show on at some point.

138
00:24:45.80 --> 00:25:10.80
But Travis Patrickwin was with us over in Iraq in Ramadi. And he was just incredibly smart guy. And a former SF guy he was then he became a captain the army. And he spoke Arabic. And he's the guy really that started saying, look,

139
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:24.80
we got to do to make friends with these locals. And he ended up producing this this actually pretty famous PowerPoint brief that just had a bunch of stick figures of hey, this is the local guy.

140
00:25:24.80 --> 00:25:37.80
This is what he sees you as this is what you see him as, but this is what he really is and this is what you know and it was a great a great document, a very simple document.

141
00:25:37.80 --> 00:25:44.80
Brilliant in its simplicity in the way it explained and it ended up being circulated all of the place.

142
00:25:44.80 --> 00:25:57.80
And that was written by a guy named Travis Patrickwin who's just again hilarious guy, very nice guy. And really had a vision of.

143
00:25:57.80 --> 00:26:13.80
The whole understanding of the Arabic culture, the tribal culture, the shakes that were there in Ramadi. And he did an amazing job moving that whole scene.

144
00:26:13.80 --> 00:26:26.80
And that whole piece of the battle, he did an amazing job moving us forward and making sure that we were culturally oriented to understand the locals.

145
00:26:26.80 --> 00:26:43.80
And unfortunately, after we left Ramadi and they were still there, Captain Patrickwin, Travis Patrickwin was in a vehicle.

146
00:26:43.80 --> 00:26:50.80
I think he was heading south on a road called sunset and he had an ID and he was killed in action.

147
00:26:50.80 --> 00:26:59.80
And it was a tragic loss of an incredible, not only incredible soldier, but just an incredible human.

148
00:26:59.80 --> 00:27:12.80
Some day we'll go to some more depth about Travis Patrickwin because he really had a huge impact.

149
00:27:12.80 --> 00:27:18.80
Next bullet point, you need some way of sorting out combatants from non-combatants.

150
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:28.80
The Russians were forced to resort to searching the pockets of civilians from military equipment and to sniffing them for the smell of gunpowder and gun oil.

151
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:36.80
This is crude and not very reliable. Train dogs were used to detect the smell of gunpowder or explosives, but were not always effective.

152
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:44.80
Nevertheless, especially train dogs probably the best way to determine if a person has been using explosives or firing a weapon recently.

153
00:27:44.80 --> 00:27:51.80
What was good for us was working alongside the Iraqi soldiers, they could tell.

154
00:27:51.80 --> 00:27:54.80
They could tell where people were from, they could tell where their accent was from, they could tell.

155
00:27:54.80 --> 00:27:56.80
But a couple questions, who could tell?

156
00:27:56.80 --> 00:28:03.80
The Iraqi soldiers, when we went and speak to some random Iraqi civilians, they could tell.

157
00:28:03.80 --> 00:28:05.80
I wouldn't be able to tell in a million years.

158
00:28:05.80 --> 00:28:13.80
Just like if you took an Iraqi and transplanted them here and put them in a room with a guy from New Jersey and a guy from Southern California and a guy from Georgia.

159
00:28:13.80 --> 00:28:16.80
They wouldn't be able to tell where any of these people were from.

160
00:28:16.80 --> 00:28:21.80
But any American could talk to any of those three people and immediately know where they were from.

161
00:28:21.80 --> 00:28:24.80
So we used the Iraqi soldiers to help us with that.

162
00:28:24.80 --> 00:28:26.80
And they're also our interpreters.

163
00:28:26.80 --> 00:28:35.80
We had interpreters that had were fluent in the language and generally came from either Iraq or some other Arab-speaking country.

164
00:28:35.80 --> 00:28:42.80
And so they had the same knowledge and they could do the same thing.

165
00:28:42.80 --> 00:28:47.80
The psychological impact of high-intensity urban combat is so intense.

166
00:28:47.80 --> 00:28:54.80
Units should maintain a large reserve that will allow them to rotate units in and out of combat.

167
00:28:54.80 --> 00:28:58.80
If a commander does this, he can preserve a unit for a long time.

168
00:28:58.80 --> 00:29:04.80
If he doesn't, once it gets used up, it cannot be rebuilt.

169
00:29:04.80 --> 00:29:19.80
So that statement about the psychological impact of high-intensity urban combat.

170
00:29:19.80 --> 00:29:24.80
And there's so many little things that make this true.

171
00:29:24.80 --> 00:29:27.80
You know, I already talked about the 360 degree threat.

172
00:29:27.80 --> 00:29:28.80
There's the ID.

173
00:29:28.80 --> 00:29:31.80
There's the civilian populace.

174
00:29:31.80 --> 00:29:44.80
There's the close-in fighting. There's all these things that make urban combat the most intense kind of combat, psychologically.

175
00:29:44.80 --> 00:30:00.80
And you have to be careful with your troops to make sure that you give them enough time out of the fight that they can maintain along deployment in that sort of intensity.

176
00:30:00.80 --> 00:30:10.80
And the Russians did not always do a very good job of that.

177
00:30:10.80 --> 00:30:15.80
Next bullet. Training and discipline are paramount.

178
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:19.80
You can accomplish nothing without them.

179
00:30:19.80 --> 00:30:24.80
You may need to do the training in the combat zone.

180
00:30:24.80 --> 00:30:33.80
discipline must be demanded. Once it begins to slip, the results are disastrous.

181
00:30:41.80 --> 00:30:47.80
That is something I believe in across the board.

182
00:30:47.80 --> 00:30:54.80
I think you mentioned that before, too, I may have mentioned that a few times. There it is again.

183
00:30:54.80 --> 00:30:56.80
Training and discipline are paramount.

184
00:30:56.80 --> 00:30:59.80
Discipline must be demanded.

185
00:30:59.80 --> 00:31:03.80
Once it begins to slip, the results are disastrous.

186
00:31:03.80 --> 00:31:10.80
You have to hold the line on the discipline. You have to.

187
00:31:10.80 --> 00:31:17.80
The Russians were surprised and embarrassed at the degree to which the Cheshins exploited the use of cellphones,

188
00:31:17.80 --> 00:31:25.80
Motorola Radeos improvised TV stations, lightweight video cameras and the internet to win the information war.

189
00:31:25.80 --> 00:31:41.80
The Russians admitted that they lost control of the information coming out of Grasdy early in the operation and never regained it.

190
00:31:41.80 --> 00:31:48.80
As expected, the Russians reiterated the need for large numbers of trained infantrymen.

191
00:31:48.80 --> 00:31:57.80
They said that some tasks such as conducting a log pack, logistics, operations could only be conducted by infantrymen.

192
00:31:57.80 --> 00:32:06.80
The logistical unit soldiers were hopelessly in net that basic military skills such as permanent defense, establishing security overwatch and so forth,

193
00:32:06.80 --> 00:32:10.80
and thereby felt easy prey to the Cheshins.

194
00:32:10.80 --> 00:32:22.80
So that's something that our troops in America have really done an outstanding job of adapting to the logistics,

195
00:32:22.80 --> 00:32:26.80
support people being combat ready.

196
00:32:26.80 --> 00:32:37.80
Because every time you're, if you're a supply guy in the Army and you've got to bring whatever it is, water, food, ammunition from Baghdad to Ramadi,

197
00:32:37.80 --> 00:32:40.80
that means you're doing a combat patrol.

198
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:42.80
That means you could likely get attacked.

199
00:32:42.80 --> 00:32:55.80
And so America did a really good job of getting their folks trained up to run these convoys and, you know, the logistics teams that supplied the war fighters, the frontline troops,

200
00:32:55.80 --> 00:32:58.80
they came under all kinds of attacks and did an outstanding job.

201
00:32:58.80 --> 00:33:05.80
So all of you folks that are listening that were running those logistics convoys, thank you.

202
00:33:05.80 --> 00:33:14.80
And you did an outstanding job and another huge risk every time you rolled out the front gate.

203
00:33:14.80 --> 00:33:21.80
Next bullet, they found that boundaries between units were still tactical weak points,

204
00:33:21.80 --> 00:33:27.80
but that it wasn't just horizontal boundaries that they had to worry about.

205
00:33:27.80 --> 00:33:34.80
In some cases, the Cheshins held the third floor in above, while the Russians held the first two floors and sometimes the roof.

206
00:33:34.80 --> 00:33:40.80
If a unit holding the second floor, a evacuated parts of it without telling the unit on the ground floor,

207
00:33:40.80 --> 00:33:46.80
the Cheshins would move troops in and attack the ground for unit through the ceiling.

208
00:33:46.80 --> 00:33:53.80
Often this resulted in Fraturside as the ground floor unit responded with uncontrolled fire through all of the ceilings,

209
00:33:53.80 --> 00:33:59.80
including the ones below that section of the building still occupied by the Russians.

210
00:33:59.80 --> 00:34:08.80
Entire battles were fought through floors, ceilings, and walls without visual contact.

211
00:34:08.80 --> 00:34:10.80
That's gotta be scary, right?

212
00:34:10.80 --> 00:34:13.80
Yeah.

213
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:16.80
Ambushes were common.

214
00:34:16.80 --> 00:34:23.80
Sometimes they actually had three tiers. Cheshins would be underground on the ground floor and on the roof.

215
00:34:23.80 --> 00:34:28.80
Each group had a different task in the ambush.

216
00:34:28.80 --> 00:34:42.80
The most common response by the Cheshins to the increasingly powerful Russian indirect aerial indirect aerial firepower was hugging the Russian unit.

217
00:34:42.80 --> 00:34:50.80
The hugging tactics caused the Russians to, sorry, if the hugging tactic caused the Russians to cease artillery and airfires,

218
00:34:50.80 --> 00:34:55.80
it became a man to man fight and the Cheshins were well equipped to win it.

219
00:34:55.80 --> 00:35:02.80
If they didn't cease the supporting fires, the Russian units suffered just as much as the Cheshins fighters did,

220
00:35:02.80 --> 00:35:11.80
sometimes even more, and the morale effect was much worse on the Russians.

221
00:35:11.80 --> 00:35:14.80
So there's...

222
00:35:14.80 --> 00:35:16.80
I mean, it's very simple.

223
00:35:16.80 --> 00:35:24.80
Oh, if the enemy is going to use, or if the Russians are going to use big bombs and big artillery and big bombs from the sky to defeat us,

224
00:35:24.80 --> 00:35:31.80
we'll just get so close in. We'll just close the distance and be so close that if you want to drop bombs, you're going to kill your own people.

225
00:35:31.80 --> 00:35:32.80
Yeah.

226
00:35:36.80 --> 00:35:47.80
Both the physical and mental health of the Russian units began to decline almost immediately upon initiation of high intensity combat.

227
00:35:47.80 --> 00:35:56.80
In less than a month, almost 20% of the Russian soldiers were suffering from viral hepatitis, which is a very serious,

228
00:35:56.80 --> 00:35:59.80
depillating with slow recovery.

229
00:35:59.80 --> 00:36:06.80
Most had chronic diarrhea and upper reps' retory infections that turned to pneumonia easily.

230
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:13.80
This was blamed on the breakdown of logistical support that meant units had a drink contaminated water.

231
00:36:13.80 --> 00:36:20.80
Units sanitary discipline broke down almost completely.

232
00:36:20.80 --> 00:36:26.80
So that discipline, like I said, it starts with the shaving and the next thing you're not boiling the water,

233
00:36:26.80 --> 00:36:31.80
the next thing you know you're sick and the next thing you're crapping all over the place and the next thing you know other people you're making other people sick,

234
00:36:31.80 --> 00:36:34.80
and it starts with the discipline.

235
00:36:34.80 --> 00:36:43.80
According to a survey of over 1,300 troops, this is a Russian troops,

236
00:36:43.80 --> 00:36:50.80
made immediately after the fighting, about 72% had some sort of psychological disorder.

237
00:36:50.80 --> 00:36:55.80
Almost 75% had an exaggerated startle response.

238
00:36:55.80 --> 00:36:59.80
That's like when there's a loud noise in the shutter from it.

239
00:36:59.80 --> 00:37:05.80
About 75% had an exaggerated startle response.

240
00:37:05.80 --> 00:37:14.80
28% had what was described as neuromotional and almost 10% had acute emotional reactions.

241
00:37:14.80 --> 00:37:21.80
The Russians recommended two psychophysiologists, one psychopharmacologist,

242
00:37:21.80 --> 00:37:29.80
one psychiatrist and one medical psychologist at each US core-sized unit.

243
00:37:29.80 --> 00:37:33.80
That's a huge recommendation for mental health.

244
00:37:33.80 --> 00:37:38.80
Although they're experiencing Afghanistan prepared them somewhat from the physical health problems,

245
00:37:38.80 --> 00:37:42.80
they were not prepared for this level of mental health treatment.

246
00:37:42.80 --> 00:37:50.80
Many permanent combat stressed casualties resulted from soldiers not being provided proper immediate treatment.

247
00:37:50.80 --> 00:38:04.80
Again, this boils down to how harsh that urban combat is, and they were not ready for it.

248
00:38:04.80 --> 00:38:14.80
They were not ready for the psychological damage that that urban combat does to the soldiers' mind.

249
00:38:14.80 --> 00:38:20.80
Now it gets in the head and you've got the startle response and the emotional acute reactions.

250
00:38:20.80 --> 00:38:22.80
It's a nightmare.

251
00:38:22.80 --> 00:38:23.80
It's a nightmare.

252
00:38:23.80 --> 00:38:28.80
That acute emotional reactions, that's like what they'll break down.

253
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:29.80
Breaking down.

254
00:38:29.80 --> 00:38:30.80
Breaking down.

255
00:38:34.80 --> 00:38:40.80
Chesions weren't afraid of tanks or BMPs and BMPs, like a Bradley fighting vehicle.

256
00:38:40.80 --> 00:38:46.80
It's basically an armored personnel character carrier for the most part with a big gun on top.

257
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:53.80
They assigned groups of RPG gunners to fire valleys at the lead and trail vehicles.

258
00:38:53.80 --> 00:38:57.80
Once these were destroyed, others were picked off one by one.

259
00:38:57.80 --> 00:39:00.80
Oh, this is battle-growsy, some facts.

260
00:39:00.80 --> 00:39:05.80
The Russian forces lost 20 of 26 tanks.

261
00:39:05.80 --> 00:39:12.80
102 of 120 BMPs in the first three days of fighting.

262
00:39:12.80 --> 00:39:13.80
Yeah.

263
00:39:13.80 --> 00:39:19.80
So imagine you've got a convoy of 12 vehicles with a tank in the tank and the tank in the back,

264
00:39:19.80 --> 00:39:22.80
and the Chesions take out the front and back.

265
00:39:22.80 --> 00:39:24.80
So now we're now guess what you're stuck.

266
00:39:24.80 --> 00:39:27.80
And then they just sit there and pick off the rest of the vehicles.

267
00:39:27.80 --> 00:39:40.80
Check, this is also important. Chesions chose firing positions high enough or low enough to stay out of the fields of fire of the tank and BMP weapons.

268
00:39:40.80 --> 00:39:52.80
So you know the angle of fire can only go so high and so low, so they just stay out of those two angles.

269
00:39:52.80 --> 00:40:03.80
Russian conscript infantry sometimes refused to dismount and often died in their BMP without ever firing a shot.

270
00:40:03.80 --> 00:40:04.80
So this is a nightmare.

271
00:40:04.80 --> 00:40:13.80
Your vehicle gets hit and if you know anything, when your vehicle gets hit or like your convoy gets hit, get out.

272
00:40:13.80 --> 00:40:19.80
In other words, if the vehicle can't move, because it's trapped by other vehicles or a trap by the road or it's trapped by whatever,

273
00:40:19.80 --> 00:40:24.80
get out of the vehicle, get out of the vehicle and take down a building, get out of the vehicle and move to cover, get out.

274
00:40:24.80 --> 00:40:30.80
But get out of the vehicle, the vehicles just a bullet magnet at that point and an RPG magnet.

275
00:40:30.80 --> 00:40:33.80
So just get out of there.

276
00:40:33.80 --> 00:40:40.80
Russian elite infantry did much better but didn't coordinate well with armored vehicles initially.

277
00:40:40.80 --> 00:40:45.80
So I can tell you that we coordinated with the armored vehicles beautifully.

278
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:53.80
And we loved them. We loved the US Army armor that we work with.

279
00:40:53.80 --> 00:41:04.80
Absolutely loved them and we coordinated with them and we worked together with them in a beautiful manner.

280
00:41:04.80 --> 00:41:08.80
Cheshins were brutish, especially with prisoners.

281
00:41:08.80 --> 00:41:15.80
Some reports say the Russians were no better but most say that the Cheshins were the worst of the two sides.

282
00:41:15.80 --> 00:41:24.80
Whoever was at fault, the battle degenerated quickly to one of no-quarter-ass, none-given.

283
00:41:24.80 --> 00:41:32.80
Russian wounded and dead were hung upside down in the windows of defended Cheshins positions.

284
00:41:32.80 --> 00:41:37.80
Russians had to shoot at the bodies to engage the Cheshins.

285
00:41:37.80 --> 00:41:46.80
Russian prisoners were decapatated and at night their heads were placed on stakes beside the roads leading into the city,

286
00:41:46.80 --> 00:41:59.80
over which Russian replacements and reinforcements had to travel.

287
00:41:59.80 --> 00:42:07.80
So you don't think that in this day and age, that's something you read about in the history books.

288
00:42:07.80 --> 00:42:10.80
You remember from the history books but there it is.

289
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:20.80
This is 1994, 1995, 1996, heads on stakes.

290
00:42:20.80 --> 00:42:28.80
Both Russian and Cheshins dead were routinely booby trapped.

291
00:42:28.80 --> 00:42:34.80
The Russians were not surprised by the ferocity and brutality of the Cheshins.

292
00:42:34.80 --> 00:42:42.80
But they were surprised by the sophistication of the Cheshins' use of booby traps and mines.

293
00:42:42.80 --> 00:42:54.80
Cheshins mined and booby trapped everything, showing excellent insight into the actions and reactions of the average Russian soldier.

294
00:42:54.80 --> 00:42:59.80
Mine and booby trap awareness was hard to maintain.

295
00:42:59.80 --> 00:43:04.80
As you look at this more, they booby trapped anything.

296
00:43:04.80 --> 00:43:09.80
They talked about how they showed insight into the actions and reactions of the average Russian soldier.

297
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:11.80
They knew what would attract them.

298
00:43:11.80 --> 00:43:15.80
They knew what they couldn't keep their hands off of and that's what they booby trapped.

299
00:43:15.80 --> 00:43:26.80
Some old shiny objects, some little something that looked expensive or something that looked worthwhile, it would booby trapped.

300
00:43:26.80 --> 00:43:37.80
Now, that kind of wraps up that first book but I pulled out some other little articles that I thought had some good information.

301
00:43:37.80 --> 00:43:48.80
This one here's Russian tactical lessons learned from fighting Cheshins' separatists by Timothy L. Thomas.

302
00:43:48.80 --> 00:43:52.80
This section.

303
00:43:52.80 --> 00:44:01.80
With regard to general ambush guidance, Coslov offered the following.

304
00:44:01.80 --> 00:44:10.80
First and foremost, mobilize your will, knowledge and experience no matter how difficult this may be.

305
00:44:10.80 --> 00:44:23.80
In order to re-establish command and control, repulse the enemy attack, seize the initiative and report the situation.

306
00:44:23.80 --> 00:44:40.80
That is a powerful statement. And it's a powerful statement on how to react to any situation. First and foremost, mobilize your will.

307
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:46.80
I love envisioning the will as like a military unit.

308
00:44:46.80 --> 00:44:56.80
First and foremost, mobilize your will. Bring it to bear wake up will, it's time to get it on.

309
00:44:56.80 --> 00:45:03.80
Yeah, in college and football, they'd say, well, I heard this other police is doing this, but they'd say buckle up in guard your grill.

310
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:07.80
What was it buckle up in guard your grill?

311
00:45:07.80 --> 00:45:11.80
Yeah, it's like, you know, get ready to go.

312
00:45:11.80 --> 00:45:18.80
Mobilize your will, your knowledge and experience no matter how difficult this may be.

313
00:45:18.80 --> 00:45:24.80
In order to re-establish command and control.

314
00:45:24.80 --> 00:45:26.80
So you've lost it.

315
00:45:26.80 --> 00:45:34.80
Saying mobilize your will, re-establish command and control, repulse the enemy attack, seize the initiative, and report the situation.

316
00:45:34.80 --> 00:45:38.80
Has some damn good advice.

317
00:45:38.80 --> 00:45:48.80
More psychological support also was a training area for improvement.

318
00:45:48.80 --> 00:45:58.80
A particular concern here were the mood swings that were observed among Russian servicemen during combat.

319
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:07.80
So you've seen these drastic mood swings and so much of this was psychological on the Russians.

320
00:46:07.80 --> 00:46:09.80
And Russians are hard people.

321
00:46:09.80 --> 00:46:13.80
I mean, we're not talking about soft people. These are Russians.

322
00:46:13.80 --> 00:46:17.80
I mean, Russians are hard people.

323
00:46:17.80 --> 00:46:23.80
The end result of such training would be to improve the servicemen's fighting spirit.

324
00:46:23.80 --> 00:46:34.80
Use of common sense and rationale to overcome confusion, the ability to act boldly, actively and decisively in battle, and the ability to achieve one's assigned goal.

325
00:46:34.80 --> 00:46:42.80
Again, this is talking about training the mind to think, to use common sense and this.

326
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:44.80
What you want to do with all your people.

327
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:52.80
I'm care what business you're in, whether you're in a war, whether you're in business, whether you're in some kind of team.

328
00:46:52.80 --> 00:46:57.80
Train the mind to use common sense.

329
00:46:57.80 --> 00:47:06.80
Train the mind for the ability to act boldly and decisively.

330
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:15.80
Got to train the mind to get free your mind.

331
00:47:15.80 --> 00:47:26.80
Now, that same article pulled out Russian lesson learned from Spetsnots, GRU reconnaissance point of view.

332
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:39.80
And the authors were K, Nickton, and S, Cosloff.

333
00:47:39.80 --> 00:47:45.80
They called this one section the Commandments for Serviceman and Cheshna.

334
00:47:45.80 --> 00:47:52.80
And what they actually were was cultural, tips on cultural sensitivities for Russian soldiers, and they are as follows.

335
00:47:52.80 --> 00:48:02.80
And I read through these, this is a directive on how to treat other human beings that you're dealing with.

336
00:48:02.80 --> 00:48:08.80
Cheshna, Russian, American, subordinate superior doesn't matter.

337
00:48:08.80 --> 00:48:10.80
What was the title of that again?

338
00:48:10.80 --> 00:48:15.80
Tips on cultural sensitivities for Russian soldiers.

339
00:48:15.80 --> 00:48:19.80
One, always maintain your authority among the local populace.

340
00:48:19.80 --> 00:48:29.80
The Cheshins are very critical of people who try to create a false authority for themselves.

341
00:48:29.80 --> 00:48:37.80
A soul-culled patronizing attitude towards others usually afflix those who cannot gain authority through other means.

342
00:48:37.80 --> 00:48:39.80
We talk about this all the time.

343
00:48:39.80 --> 00:48:43.80
You don't run around throwing your rank out.

344
00:48:43.80 --> 00:48:50.80
Make you look like a jackass.

345
00:48:50.80 --> 00:48:57.80
Next, avoid unwanted confiscations and unlawful requisitions of food and property.

346
00:48:57.80 --> 00:49:01.80
That one makes pretty easy sense. Don't steal from people.

347
00:49:01.80 --> 00:49:04.80
Next one, be fair.

348
00:49:04.80 --> 00:49:08.80
Every local inhabit must be dealt with firmly but fairly.

349
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:17.80
Injustice gives rise to negative attitude in any person.

350
00:49:17.80 --> 00:49:21.80
So be fair.

351
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:26.80
Reward a Cheshna who performs his assigned task well.

352
00:49:26.80 --> 00:49:35.80
To accomplish a task that you need to get accomplished, choose the most authoritative person among the local inhabitants and get him to carry out the task.

353
00:49:35.80 --> 00:49:44.80
If he does the job right and does it correctly, you should reward the elder by giving him additional authority and by giving some kind of gift.

354
00:49:44.80 --> 00:49:48.80
Reward your people when they do a good job.

355
00:49:48.80 --> 00:49:52.80
What's all we're saying here?

356
00:49:52.80 --> 00:49:58.80
When dealing with Cheshins, display a sense of calm and self-worth.

357
00:49:58.80 --> 00:50:06.80
You will achieve more through this than through screaming obscenities. Never beat a Cheshins.

358
00:50:06.80 --> 00:50:13.80
And it goes on to say, Cheshins are a proud people with a very intense sense of pride in self-worth.

359
00:50:13.80 --> 00:50:21.80
Therefore, you will achieve nothing by humiliating them, by screaming at them, and by abusing them.

360
00:50:21.80 --> 00:50:26.80
You will only in bitter them.

361
00:50:26.80 --> 00:50:30.80
Right? This is how you treat other people.

362
00:50:30.80 --> 00:50:42.80
And it goes on to say, even in casual conversation, do not give orders and do not use profanity that you might normally use as interjections.

363
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:52.80
So this idea of your own and screaming, you think you're going to do what you want to do, doesn't work.

364
00:50:52.80 --> 00:50:59.80
Next, respect Cheshins, women, girls, old men and children as if they were Russians.

365
00:50:59.80 --> 00:51:09.80
Always remember that Cheshins respect a manly qualities, therefore never permit any disrespect or vulgarity with regard to their women.

366
00:51:09.80 --> 00:51:19.80
Never allow yourself to curse a defences people in revenge for the outrageous of militants against Russian women, old men and children.

367
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:26.80
So keep yourself in check and make sure you're not blaming people for something that somebody else did.

368
00:51:31.80 --> 00:51:34.80
Study and be respectful of national traditions.

369
00:51:34.80 --> 00:51:40.80
The more you know about the Cheshins, national traditions, the more you will understand their behavior.

370
00:51:40.80 --> 00:51:44.80
That means you will be able to predict their actions.

371
00:51:44.80 --> 00:51:53.80
At the same time a person that respects the local traditions will be respected himself, G, what a novel idea.

372
00:51:53.80 --> 00:51:59.80
Know who you're dealing with. Respect what they do.

373
00:51:59.80 --> 00:52:17.80
Always remember that the above mentioned commandments apply to the fullest extends to possible to local inhabitants, and they do not apply at all to the militants.

374
00:52:17.80 --> 00:52:23.80
Never forget you and a region where there are insurgents against whom you are at war.

375
00:52:23.80 --> 00:52:30.80
Therefore you can never be certain that the person with whom you are speaking is not helping the militants.

376
00:52:30.80 --> 00:52:44.80
Under conditions of guerrilla warfare is better to turn down an invitation to someone's home and risk offending the host than it is to take advantage of his hospitality and ending up being an easy catch for insurgents.

377
00:52:44.80 --> 00:52:59.80
Again, I think those were just like rules on how to treat other human beings in the world and be successful with it.

378
00:52:59.80 --> 00:53:05.80
Now we get to another little excerpt that I found.

379
00:53:05.80 --> 00:53:16.80
And this is from Soldat Udachi, which is basically to magazine. It's almost like a soldier of fortune magazine.

380
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:25.80
And these were some of the rules for a soldier and a zone of armed conflict.

381
00:53:25.80 --> 00:53:31.80
Fighters can be anywhere opposing his peaceful citizens in the daytime and changing into killers at night.

382
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:37.80
Don't accept someone's friendly just because they speak Russian and where came a flash close.

383
00:53:37.80 --> 00:53:43.80
This is perhaps my favorite one right here. You don't get a second chance in wartime.

384
00:53:43.80 --> 00:53:51.80
Never lose the feeling of danger or of the strength of the spirit of the Russian soldier.

385
00:53:51.80 --> 00:53:59.80
Never leave a base without the commanders permission in the field. Never touch bright or expensive objects as they may be mined.

386
00:53:59.80 --> 00:54:06.80
In the mountains, whoever is higher is stronger.

387
00:54:06.80 --> 00:54:12.80
Take the high ground or the high ground is going to take you.

388
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:20.80
Pay attention to the flanks as the basic maneuver of the insurgents is to get around your back and envelop your force.

389
00:54:20.80 --> 00:54:23.80
Always check your flanks.

390
00:54:23.80 --> 00:54:39.80
I'm going to burn through some of these now. These are tactical observations from the Grosni combat experience by Brett C. Jenkinson, who is a major in the US Army.

391
00:54:39.80 --> 00:54:44.80
You are really good article worth checking out. Google it.

392
00:54:44.80 --> 00:54:49.80
But I broke down some of these.

393
00:54:49.80 --> 00:54:53.80
Cheshien lessons learned. This is from the Cheshien side.

394
00:54:53.80 --> 00:54:57.80
Hit and run tactics confused the Russian units.

395
00:54:57.80 --> 00:55:02.80
Targeting Russian radio operators destroyed Russian command control.

396
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:09.80
Small units provided good mobility and more effective basic maneuver unit.

397
00:55:09.80 --> 00:55:22.80
Hugging, which we already talked about, which was staying 50 to 250 meters of the enemy was the most effective way to avoid enemy artillery, mortars or close air support.

398
00:55:22.80 --> 00:55:28.80
Synchronized ambushes confused the enemy to the point that he did not know where to shoot back.

399
00:55:28.80 --> 00:55:37.80
As a result, Russian units would start fire fights between themselves.

400
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:46.80
Destroying the lead and train vehicles and then each vehicle in between could easily isolate Russian armored columns.

401
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:57.80
Shooting enemy soldiers in the legs caused snipers to engage other soldiers trying to evacuate the wounded.

402
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:06.80
An on leadership, a loosely organized unit that allowed greater freedom of action was effective to defend Grosni.

403
00:56:06.80 --> 00:56:10.80
Little bit of freedom on the battlefield goes a long way.

404
00:56:10.80 --> 00:56:15.80
Now the Russian lessons learned training and preparation are the most important thing in winning battles.

405
00:56:15.80 --> 00:56:21.80
Urban combat training must be longer than days or weeks to be effective.

406
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:27.80
Urban combat maneuver must be tailored to fit the enemy situation.

407
00:56:27.80 --> 00:56:35.80
Task organizing to small squad sized combined assault groups worked better than large units.

408
00:56:35.80 --> 00:56:44.80
Russians underestimated the Cheshire and will to fight.

409
00:56:44.80 --> 00:57:03.80
Lessons learned from successful tactics should be integrated into follow-on missions to be successful one must adapt quicker than the enemy.

410
00:57:03.80 --> 00:57:11.80
For the leadership perspective, again, this is the Russians adapted less as learned from previous urban battles, provide proved invaluable.

411
00:57:11.80 --> 00:57:15.80
The greatest challenge to leadership was maintaining morale.

412
00:57:15.80 --> 00:57:21.80
High casually rates destroyed the already low morale of combat units.

413
00:57:21.80 --> 00:57:30.80
Another challenge to morale was the Russian soldiers fear of enemy mistreatment if captured.

414
00:57:30.80 --> 00:57:39.80
This is an important one of failure to justify the nature of Russian military intervention in Cheshire resulted in low morale.

415
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:49.80
So the troops on the ground not knowing and not understanding why they were there, not understanding the strategic and important or the vision hurt their morale big time.

416
00:57:49.80 --> 00:58:04.80
Now, I have a couple of excerpts here from this is from an article that was in the LA Times January 13, 1995 by Sony Fron.

417
00:58:04.80 --> 00:58:09.80
Captured Russian soldiers paint bleak picture of Cheshire and conditions.

418
00:58:09.80 --> 00:58:21.80
So this is Grasnia, Grasnia, Russia, Russian troop morale is so low, conditions are so poor and losses are so heavy that the Russian attempt to take Grasnia is floundering.

419
00:58:21.80 --> 00:58:27.80
Two Russian soldiers captured in the capital of the Breakaway Republic of Cheshire said Thursday.

420
00:58:27.80 --> 00:58:32.80
The soldiers are against this war and so are a commanders.

421
00:58:32.80 --> 00:58:41.80
Said Alexia, 20-year-old junior sergeant was called, while trying to steal food from an empty house and growls and after you've gone five days without a solid meal.

422
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:43.80
We are forced to fight.

423
00:58:43.80 --> 00:58:48.80
The two soldiers said Russian positions had frequently been bombed by Russian war planes.

424
00:58:48.80 --> 00:58:58.80
Many soldiers had been killed by friendly fire from the Russian side and constant vehicle breakdowns made it impossible for them to pick up their dead and wounded.

425
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:07.80
And this is, I haven't found the book yet, I'm sure I will.

426
00:59:07.80 --> 00:59:14.80
The book that takes you into the battle onto the ground because I've been talking all the strategic stuff and generally I don't like to do that.

427
00:59:14.80 --> 00:59:18.80
I want to hear from the person on the ground.

428
00:59:18.80 --> 00:59:27.80
And this is where you start to get it. You start to see what the Russians, what the front line troopers were thinking and what it was like for them.

429
00:59:27.80 --> 00:59:33.80
And here you had him saying that many soldiers have been killed by friendly fire from the Russian side.

430
00:59:33.80 --> 00:59:40.80
Constant vehicle breakdowns made it impossible for the pick up their dead and wounded.

431
00:59:40.80 --> 00:59:45.80
In a company that had a hundred men, now they're only fifty left.

432
00:59:45.80 --> 00:59:52.80
In our battalion out of 350 men over 250 had been killed.

433
00:59:52.80 --> 01:00:02.80
The soldiers account syndicate that the new official figures putting the Russian military death toll at 394 soldiers are vastly understated.

434
01:00:02.80 --> 01:00:07.80
Cheshand sources put the Russian casualties at about 3,000 dead.

435
01:00:07.80 --> 01:00:10.80
These Russians are worse than fascists.

436
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:17.80
Said, Gregory A. Smirnaugh 50, whose beloved territory was decapitated by the rocket.

437
01:00:17.80 --> 01:00:22.80
For young guys have been killed in our street, they weren't fighters, they weren't against anyone.

438
01:00:22.80 --> 01:00:30.80
I apologize for what Russia is doing here, Smirnaugh said, I'm embarrassed by my country in front of the whole world.

439
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:37.80
A month after President Boris Hieltson promised the Russian public that law-enor would be restored in Cheshania,

440
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:41.80
and that the illegal armed formations in Grasni would quickly be disarmed.

441
01:00:41.80 --> 01:00:46.80
It was unclear whether Russian forces could soon break through the fierce Cheshand resistance.

442
01:00:46.80 --> 01:00:56.80
I don't think they can take the city, said one Cheshand fighter, they can destroy it, but they can't capture it.

443
01:00:56.80 --> 01:01:03.80
The two Russian prisoners who had entered Grasni on December 20 looked exhausted, filthy, and frightened.

444
01:01:03.80 --> 01:01:13.80
If their condition is typical of the rest of the enemy, it is not surprising that the Russians have not yet attempted another all-out of infantry assault on Grasni.

445
01:01:13.80 --> 01:01:20.80
Frankly, there is no discipline, no anything in the military now the prisoner said.

446
01:01:20.80 --> 01:01:28.80
The soldiers are weakened, they haven't washed for a long time, they are hungry and unshaven.

447
01:01:28.80 --> 01:01:38.80
Even a soldier, when he wants to describe how bad things have gotten, he says that the soldiers are dirty, hungry and unshaven.

448
01:01:38.80 --> 01:01:44.80
There were times where more of us were getting killed by our own people than by the Cheshands.

449
01:01:44.80 --> 01:01:53.80
We don't even have time to pick up our dead just no time where either fighting the Cheshand or our own air force is bombing us.

450
01:01:53.80 --> 01:02:02.80
The prisoner added that they've been ordered to kill everybody from kids to old people, not just Cheshands, but also Russians.

451
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:05.80
This is a nightmare.

452
01:02:05.80 --> 01:02:13.80
The two soldiers said they went to a house in northeast Grasni neighborhood to look for food because they hadn't had a proper meal for five days.

453
01:02:13.80 --> 01:02:20.80
They'd been surviving on dry rations that were never enough and were delivered to their positions, irregularly.

454
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:30.80
As the prisoner spoke, Cheshand fighters gathered around them to listen upon hearing the Russians admit that they had broken to the house and one man shouted angrily, looters.

455
01:02:30.80 --> 01:02:37.80
All we wanted was something to eat, muttered the prisoner.

456
01:02:37.80 --> 01:02:52.80
Now, we gotta remember we've got a, you know, this is the Soviet Union, this is Russia, so they have their own media and I found this article.

457
01:02:52.80 --> 01:02:59.80
And I shouldn't be laughing because it's horrible, but this is the Moscow Times talking about the other story of Grasni.

458
01:02:59.80 --> 01:03:06.80
The city of Grasni is cold and dirty again. This is some kind of a state approved message.

459
01:03:06.80 --> 01:03:13.80
There is no water and no electricity at night. The streets are illuminated only by distant fires sparked by Russian-shelling and occasional flares.

460
01:03:13.80 --> 01:03:21.80
Here is full of sound constantly pumping of artillery shells, the screams of God missiles, and a crackle of machine gun fire.

461
01:03:21.80 --> 01:03:29.80
The only source of heat in the burned out basements of Grasni are from home-made furnaces that Russian soldiers had fashioned from bricks of destroyed buildings.

462
01:03:29.80 --> 01:03:36.80
At night officers and soldiers huddled around them, their faces dirty and covered with sweats since they really have water with which to wash it.

463
01:03:36.80 --> 01:03:44.80
It almost looks like they are wearing the kind of camouflage paint that is the issued to soldiers in western armies.

464
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:54.80
These men are by and large, normal decent people. They believe that they are doing their duty in Cheshna. That's a little bit contrary to what we just heard from the prisoners.

465
01:03:54.80 --> 01:04:01.80
Of course, now the prisoners, those guys are in a derests situation too, because they might get their heads chopped off at any moment.

466
01:04:01.80 --> 01:04:08.80
So they're probably making the case the best they can that, hey, you know, we're not in the sport of Russia, they're just trying to stay alive.

467
01:04:08.80 --> 01:04:17.80
They insist that back to the article, they insist that they do not intentionally attack peaceful civilians, but are instead waging battle against an organized and pedulous enemy.

468
01:04:17.80 --> 01:04:25.80
The conscripts who are risking their lives in Cheshna might as well be considered volunteers.

469
01:04:25.80 --> 01:04:35.80
This is the paper, you know, saying that these poor guys that are fighting, they should be considered volunteers, even though they're conscripts that are being forced to fight there, they might as well be considered volunteers.

470
01:04:35.80 --> 01:04:45.80
Russia is not declared a war or martial law, so nothing threatens visitors except the moral condemnation of the comrades they leave behind.

471
01:04:45.80 --> 01:04:54.80
The army's morale has been steadily improving, as it becomes more experienced and street fighting.

472
01:04:54.80 --> 01:05:05.80
Again, there's countless documented cases of the morale completely falling apart and being one of the premier causes of the loss of the battle.

473
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:14.80
It's casualty rate is falling and is able to inflict increasing punishment on the Cheshna fighters. The military is confident of victory.

474
01:05:14.80 --> 01:05:20.80
Among these soldiers, you hear a different opinion about the war than what you read in Moscow.

475
01:05:20.80 --> 01:05:26.80
Many reports in the media about Cheshna campaign are obviously biased against the military.

476
01:05:26.80 --> 01:05:36.80
Some may even be censored. When I was in Cheshna on January 22, a crew from Russian television was in Grasnese shooting report for the evening news program.

477
01:05:36.80 --> 01:05:42.80
The report included graphic footage of the bodies of Russian soldiers who had been mutilated by the Cheshians.

478
01:05:42.80 --> 01:05:47.80
However, the host of the program refused to air it without even seeing it.

479
01:05:47.80 --> 01:05:51.80
Of course, only a fraction of the Russian army is fighting in Cheshna.

480
01:05:51.80 --> 01:05:57.80
But they've been sent here from virtually every military district in the country.

481
01:05:57.80 --> 01:06:04.80
Eventually, they were returned to their bases and tell their stories to the rest of their comrades and arms.

482
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:15.80
And those soldiers will put a lot more stock in what the Cheshna veterans have to say than they will in any press reports or human rights activists.

483
01:06:15.80 --> 01:06:23.80
So there's the official Russian version.

484
01:06:23.80 --> 01:06:27.80
Brutal.

485
01:06:27.80 --> 01:06:31.80
In your experiences that ever happened here.

486
01:06:31.80 --> 01:06:33.80
Like you saw here, stuff in the media and you're like,

487
01:06:33.80 --> 01:06:35.80
Dang, that's not how happened.

488
01:06:35.80 --> 01:06:37.80
It definitely happens here.

489
01:06:37.80 --> 01:06:39.80
There's no doubt about it.

490
01:06:39.80 --> 01:06:46.80
The way that the media portrays things is very wrong, you know, often very wrong.

491
01:06:46.80 --> 01:06:59.80
I think one of the classics that I've been telling lately are talking about lately is that they never portray the Iraqi people as normal human beings that just want to live normal lives.

492
01:06:59.80 --> 01:07:06.80
They never portray the Iraqi people like that when that's what they are.

493
01:07:06.80 --> 01:07:10.80
Yeah.

494
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:16.80
The vast majority of Iraqi people are normal people that want to have a job raised their kids, let their kids go to school and prove their lives do better.

495
01:07:16.80 --> 01:07:20.80
That's what the vast majority of Iraqi people who want.

496
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:34.80
But you know, when, when's the last time you saw an American family on the news that was going to the store to go grocery shopping and then come home and and do some yard work in the afternoon.

497
01:07:34.80 --> 01:07:36.80
No, they don't show that because it's not news.

498
01:07:36.80 --> 01:07:38.80
That's the same thing in Iraq.

499
01:07:38.80 --> 01:07:40.80
They don't show that.

500
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:42.80
Yeah.

501
01:07:42.80 --> 01:07:47.80
So we always get this impression that, you know, that everyone in Iraq is some kind of militant.

502
01:07:47.80 --> 01:07:48.80
Right.

503
01:07:48.80 --> 01:07:51.80
Whether it's tired of us being here, it's not true.

504
01:07:51.80 --> 01:07:53.80
Not true at all.

505
01:07:53.80 --> 01:07:57.80
So that's one of the biggest points I can think of where the media can just do.

506
01:07:57.80 --> 01:07:59.80
To they just get it wrong.

507
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:04.80
And it really leaves people in America thinking, well, God, why are we there?

508
01:08:04.80 --> 01:08:05.80
Yeah.

509
01:08:05.80 --> 01:08:08.80
It's so crazy that we would do, you know, why they don't want us there?

510
01:08:08.80 --> 01:08:09.80
No, actually they do want us there.

511
01:08:09.80 --> 01:08:11.80
But you don't show those people.

512
01:08:11.80 --> 01:08:13.80
You show the protesters because that's news.

513
01:08:13.80 --> 01:08:14.80
Yeah.

514
01:08:14.80 --> 01:08:18.80
It's not news to get interviewed someone that says, yeah, it's great having the Americans here hopefully they can maintain the peace.

515
01:08:18.80 --> 01:08:19.80
That's not news.

516
01:08:19.80 --> 01:08:20.80
Yeah, isn't that crazy?

517
01:08:20.80 --> 01:08:22.80
Oh, it's sure that's not news.

518
01:08:22.80 --> 01:08:24.80
And that kind of makes sense.

519
01:08:24.80 --> 01:08:26.80
You know, why would you report on an American family?

520
01:08:26.80 --> 01:08:29.80
You just, you know, the dad went to work.

521
01:08:29.80 --> 01:08:30.80
You want to report on that because that's not news.

522
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:31.80
So that makes sense.

523
01:08:31.80 --> 01:08:39.80
But the fact that you're not reporting every day stuff is essentially changing the accurate message into a message that's inaccurate.

524
01:08:39.80 --> 01:08:41.80
The that's something, you know.

525
01:08:41.80 --> 01:08:42.80
Yeah, it is.

526
01:08:42.80 --> 01:08:43.80
It is.

527
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:46.80
It's, it's horrible.

528
01:08:46.80 --> 01:08:49.80
It's horrible to see.

529
01:08:49.80 --> 01:08:52.80
This is just another little section.

530
01:08:52.80 --> 01:09:00.80
Russian counter insurgency operation in Cheshneapart 1 winning the battle losing the war by Matthew and

531
01:09:00.80 --> 01:09:09.80
Janko RPG and sniper fire focused on exposed Russian troops.

532
01:09:09.80 --> 01:09:18.80
Small groups of 10 to 20 Cheshneapfighters moved in non-abildings and the surrounding mountains to engage heavily armed and armored Russian troops.

533
01:09:18.80 --> 01:09:22.80
The Cheshneap teams were attacking shifts.

534
01:09:22.80 --> 01:09:28.80
Some attacking, while the others rested, so that a force of no more than 50 held entire battalions at bay,

535
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:37.80
bottled necked in the narrow streets and cities, or the treacherous defiles of the mountains.

536
01:09:37.80 --> 01:09:44.80
The Cheshneutalyzation of information and space and their highly sophisticated networking allowed them a tremendous advantage in terms of physical combat,

537
01:09:44.80 --> 01:09:50.80
and even more important advantage in terms of psychological impact on their enemy.

538
01:09:50.80 --> 01:09:56.80
Rather than a group of rag tag and surgeon fighters fueled by hatred and national fanaticism,

539
01:09:56.80 --> 01:10:03.80
the Cheshnefiders were highly trained, disciplined, well-equipped, and knowledgeable of the terrain.

540
01:10:03.80 --> 01:10:11.80
From the individual up through the army level, the Cheshneutalyzation held the advantage in all but air power and fire support.

541
01:10:11.80 --> 01:10:14.80
We already talked about how they overcame that.

542
01:10:14.80 --> 01:10:26.80
The Cheshnefiders proved better trained, equipped to technically skilled and fed and demonstrated remarkably higher morale and motivation in addition to an intimate knowledge of the hazardous terrain.

543
01:10:26.80 --> 01:10:34.80
It's just incredible how over and over again they point out on both sides how big of a factor morale is.

544
01:10:34.80 --> 01:10:43.80
So if you're in a leadership position, whether you're working with a team, whether you're working with a company, whether you're working with a business, morale is so important,

545
01:10:43.80 --> 01:10:46.80
and you have to pay attention to it.

546
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:53.80
Yeah, it seems that kind of etiquland or something seems like morale is kind of this extra thing.

547
01:10:53.80 --> 01:11:01.80
Oh, what you don't feel good, you know, business business, you know, you don't feel good about it, but that's kind of the fuel, you know,

548
01:11:01.80 --> 01:11:07.80
the fuel, it's, I even do it. Yeah, I wouldn't say it's the fuel, I'd say it's the fire.

549
01:11:07.80 --> 01:11:10.80
You go, right? Right? Yeah.

550
01:11:10.80 --> 01:11:17.80
Throughout the first Cheshneutalyzation War, Cheshnefiders, many of them former Soviet soldiers with combat experience in Afghanistan,

551
01:11:17.80 --> 01:11:21.80
dug into the hills and fought a defensive and fierce war of attrition with the Russian troops,

552
01:11:21.80 --> 01:11:25.80
not unlike their former Afghani counterparts.

553
01:11:25.80 --> 01:11:30.80
Although both sides engage in acts of brutality to weaken the enemies resolved the fight.

554
01:11:30.80 --> 01:11:38.80
Cheshnefiders far out did their Russian counterparts in these grisly psychological tactics.

555
01:11:38.80 --> 01:11:45.80
They hung Russian wounded upside down, wounded and dead upside down in the windows and defensive positions.

556
01:11:45.80 --> 01:11:51.80
For example, forcing the Russians to fire at their combat comrades in order to engage the rebels.

557
01:11:51.80 --> 01:11:55.80
Clearly, that's the second time we've talked about that. Clearly, that had a huge impact.

558
01:11:55.80 --> 01:12:00.80
And you can't even imagine what that does to you psychologically when you want to shoot at the enemy.

559
01:12:00.80 --> 01:12:05.80
You got a shoot at one of your brothers who's either wounded.

560
01:12:05.80 --> 01:12:08.80
I mean, he might be dead, he's possibly just wounded.

561
01:12:08.80 --> 01:12:13.80
Yeah. And either way, he's just right there. You got a shoot at, yeah.

562
01:12:13.80 --> 01:12:20.80
Both Russian and Cheshneutalyzation dead were routinely booby trapped by the Cheshneuts who showed sophisticated insight

563
01:12:20.80 --> 01:12:27.80
into the likely actions to react to the average Russian soldiers we already talked about that.

564
01:12:27.80 --> 01:12:33.80
In addition, Cheshnefiders used dirty tactics collectively learned from dozens of asymmetrical guerrilla conflicts before,

565
01:12:33.80 --> 01:12:39.80
such as instructing snipers to aim for the legs of Russian troops injuring, but not incapacitating them

566
01:12:39.80 --> 01:12:45.80
and then shooting free range at the subsequent rescue parties that were sure to come.

567
01:12:45.80 --> 01:12:52.80
Some snipers aimed specifically at the groin, dealing a crippling and humiliating wound,

568
01:12:52.80 --> 01:12:58.80
and a humiliating wound that resulted in a slow, painful death.

569
01:12:58.80 --> 01:13:05.80
And we experienced this in Iraq too, where in part of it was like room or mill,

570
01:13:05.80 --> 01:13:12.80
where there's people who'd say, oh man, because I remember in Felusia there was a sniper that shot a couple of guys in the groin.

571
01:13:12.80 --> 01:13:17.80
And then one person got shot in the groin in Ramadi.

572
01:13:17.80 --> 01:13:20.80
And I just remember if we could all go there, go there, this is what they did.

573
01:13:20.80 --> 01:13:23.80
It's psychological attack.

574
01:13:23.80 --> 01:13:33.80
Cheshneuts routinely dressed in Russian uniforms to gain access to bases and used these opportunities to launch surprise attacks from behind enemy lines.

575
01:13:33.80 --> 01:13:39.80
Each Cheshneuts took seriously the notion that the center of gravity in the war was no longer the enemy's army,

576
01:13:39.80 --> 01:13:42.80
but rather the enemy's people.

577
01:13:42.80 --> 01:13:45.80
Tactics were devised to attack the psyche of the Russians,

578
01:13:45.80 --> 01:13:51.80
aimed at creating a constant level, high level of psychological stress on the Russian servicemen

579
01:13:51.80 --> 01:13:53.80
to undermine their morale.

580
01:13:53.80 --> 01:14:03.80
So the Cheshneuts were attacking them, a attacking them, doing things that were attacking them psychologically.

581
01:14:03.80 --> 01:14:11.80
Hardened by a united sense of purpose in driving out the invader, the Cheshneuts troops terrified and terrorized the Russian troops,

582
01:14:11.80 --> 01:14:15.80
slowly bleeding out the morale and willingness to fight.

583
01:14:15.80 --> 01:14:24.80
The Russian troops, many still in their teens, were woefully unprepared and untrained in comparison.

584
01:14:24.80 --> 01:14:32.80
The result of such a disparity in morale and military expectations had tragic consequences.

585
01:14:32.80 --> 01:14:40.80
According to one Russian participant, the men on the ground, shaken and angered by their losses,

586
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:44.80
were just taking it out on anyone they found.

587
01:14:44.80 --> 01:14:51.80
There was revenge in the air for those comrades who had been killed, and now you end up with.

588
01:14:51.80 --> 01:14:58.80
So the Russian troops get so frustrated, they're so psychologically damaged that there's going out and taking it out on the local Cheshneuts,

589
01:14:58.80 --> 01:15:03.80
which are some of these Russian, some of these people are good Russians.

590
01:15:03.80 --> 01:15:08.80
And they're taking it out on them, they're taking it out on anyone that could be an insurgent, and now what happens.

591
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:13.80
Now everyone starts turning against you. It's a nightmare.

592
01:15:13.80 --> 01:15:20.80
Without recourse to set peace, conventional battle, the Cheshneutians and Cheshneuts had argumentally arguably achieved the

593
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:29.80
act me of skill by subduing their enemy largely before the fighting began. At the same time, the Russians,

594
01:15:29.80 --> 01:15:39.80
with their vast superiority and military firepower, failed to use it, to tactical and strategic advantage.

595
01:15:39.80 --> 01:15:47.80
By employing air and space power, thoughtlessly or unimaginably, the Russians' power was less effective,

596
01:15:47.80 --> 01:15:52.80
or even disastrously impotent.

597
01:15:52.80 --> 01:15:58.80
So a lack of imagination, a lack of creativity.

598
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:04.80
Brutal, brutal war, and a lot of lessons learned.

599
01:16:04.80 --> 01:16:09.80
And I can tell you that there's a lot of lessons that were learned by those Russians on the ground,

600
01:16:09.80 --> 01:16:22.80
that were absolutely implemented by American forces in, I know in Romadi, absolutely the amount of similarities for that urban combat,

601
01:16:22.80 --> 01:16:30.80
and the things that we watched out for, because of the sacrifices made by the Russian soldiers,

602
01:16:30.80 --> 01:16:41.80
I'd say, how do you jump back and I'm glad that we were able to take away some lessons and take those to the battlefield in Romadi,

603
01:16:41.80 --> 01:16:48.80
and do things like protect the local populace, and do things like understand their culture.

604
01:16:48.80 --> 01:16:57.80
And do things like not take out our aggression on the local populace, which only turns the local populace against you.

605
01:16:57.80 --> 01:17:09.80
And it was that professionalism of the US military, of the US army soldiers, of the US Marines, that professionalism,

606
01:17:09.80 --> 01:17:15.80
to maintain that discipline throughout the battle.

607
01:17:15.80 --> 01:17:26.80
That was actually absolutely critical in bringing about the victory.

608
01:17:26.80 --> 01:17:41.80
It's crazy how all these strategies and tactics are, it's all the same, the patent, book, all the books, these messages are, it's all the same.

609
01:17:41.80 --> 01:17:42.80
It's crazy.

610
01:17:42.80 --> 01:17:44.80
It is, it is all the same.

611
01:17:44.80 --> 01:17:48.80
It is crazy how similar they are, and when they just completely line up.

612
01:17:48.80 --> 01:17:58.80
And again, it's amazing how the tactics from the battlefield reflect the tactics in business,

613
01:17:58.80 --> 01:18:02.80
and reflect the tactics in human life.

614
01:18:02.80 --> 01:18:10.80
Yeah, you know, which kind of gave me eerie feeling, what is one you talked about, the Cheshnean rebels,

615
01:18:10.80 --> 01:18:16.80
that there were the rebels, right, and some Cheshnean rebels, they attacked the Russian morale.

616
01:18:16.80 --> 01:18:23.80
Right, so what gave me eerie feeling is that's what you get with like, guys who abuse their girlfriend or their wife.

617
01:18:23.80 --> 01:18:24.80
That's what they do.

618
01:18:24.80 --> 01:18:25.80
They attack them morale.

619
01:18:25.80 --> 01:18:26.80
Yes.

620
01:18:26.80 --> 01:18:26.80
Yes.

621
01:18:26.80 --> 01:18:30.80
No idea, give me that feeling, but it's like so.

622
01:18:30.80 --> 01:18:35.80
It's because you gave you that eerie feeling because you understand how devastating it is.

623
01:18:35.80 --> 01:18:39.80
Yes, you know, and it's not exactly, yeah, that's a perfect way to put it.

624
01:18:39.80 --> 01:18:44.80
Because it's not this thing where it's different than chopping off the guys' heads and putting it on on stakes.

625
01:18:44.80 --> 01:18:46.80
That's something for sure, but it's way different.

626
01:18:46.80 --> 01:18:52.80
It's on this weird, like kind of covert level, but still so devastating.

627
01:18:52.80 --> 01:18:59.80
So it's weird where it's, it's, it's bad when you, you see a guy doing that to like, to a girl.

628
01:18:59.80 --> 01:19:01.80
Yeah, so it's, it's, it's horrible.

629
01:19:01.80 --> 01:19:08.80
And also, and you mentioned this earlier, the morale piece is something that gets ignored so often.

630
01:19:08.80 --> 01:19:12.80
Yeah, especially in the business world, where people just, they're morale,

631
01:19:12.80 --> 01:19:15.80
they're morale, they'll take a beating, the market's bad, all these things.

632
01:19:15.80 --> 01:19:20.80
And if you don't prop up that morale and you don't protect them around, you don't defend them around.

633
01:19:20.80 --> 01:19:22.80
You don't strengthen them around.

634
01:19:22.80 --> 01:19:25.80
That's when you get what's what happened to the Russian soldiers.

635
01:19:25.80 --> 01:19:27.80
The morale fell apart.

636
01:19:27.80 --> 01:19:37.80
Yeah, and a lot of times, if the morale is not like in a company or something, the leader, if he's bad, he'll kind of blame them.

637
01:19:37.80 --> 01:19:38.80
Like, you guys have bad attitudes.

638
01:19:38.80 --> 01:19:41.80
You know, we're trying to do some business here and you guys have bad attitudes.

639
01:19:41.80 --> 01:19:44.80
But it's, you know, yeah, that's how it's going to be opposite there.

640
01:19:44.80 --> 01:19:51.80
Leader that's not taking ownership of the situation, which is why ownership is so important.

641
01:19:51.80 --> 01:19:57.80
Because the minute you start blaming, I mean, you're just, you're just putting an ale on the coffin.

642
01:19:57.80 --> 01:20:03.80
When you start blaming people for bad morale, you know, it's, it's the, hey, the beatings will continue until morale improves.

643
01:20:03.80 --> 01:20:04.80
Right.

644
01:20:04.80 --> 01:20:05.80
Yeah, exactly.

645
01:20:05.80 --> 01:20:06.80
Yeah, it doesn't work.

646
01:20:06.80 --> 01:20:07.80
Yeah.

647
01:20:07.80 --> 01:20:09.80
You know, the beatings do not improve morale.

648
01:20:09.80 --> 01:20:19.80
That's, that's, would you say, kind of at the top of your head, would you say that that's more common than not that just that whole thing where, you know, just to blame people in general.

649
01:20:19.80 --> 01:20:20.80
Oh, absolutely.

650
01:20:20.80 --> 01:20:21.80
Absolutely.

651
01:20:21.80 --> 01:20:22.80
Absolutely.

652
01:20:22.80 --> 01:20:27.80
I mean, it is absolutely a very common problem in leadership.

653
01:20:27.80 --> 01:20:27.80
Yeah.

654
01:20:27.80 --> 01:20:31.80
That's, that's why our book is done really well because people say, oh, man.

655
01:20:31.80 --> 01:20:32.80
Yeah.

656
01:20:32.80 --> 01:20:33.80
I do that.

657
01:20:33.80 --> 01:20:34.80
Oh, I can't believe I do that.

658
01:20:34.80 --> 01:20:37.80
Yeah, because we never hear any of this stuff like growing up,

659
01:20:37.80 --> 01:20:42.80
you know, you say, okay, don't blame, but it's, it's not like a real strong message that you're saying growing up.

660
01:20:42.80 --> 01:20:43.80
I know, I wasn't.

661
01:20:43.80 --> 01:20:54.80
I don't think that that people have isolated and focused on ownership at this level.

662
01:20:54.80 --> 01:20:57.80
I think that's why the, I think that's why the book is done very well.

663
01:20:57.80 --> 01:20:58.80
Yeah.

664
01:20:58.80 --> 01:21:03.80
I think that's why people continue to contact me and say, hey, that you guys, thank you for writing this book.

665
01:21:03.80 --> 01:21:04.80
It's changed away.

666
01:21:04.80 --> 01:21:05.80
I look at everything.

667
01:21:05.80 --> 01:21:07.80
It's changed the way I've done my business.

668
01:21:07.80 --> 01:21:14.80
It's changed the way I'm treating my wife, changed my family, it's changed my outlook on my physical failings.

669
01:21:14.80 --> 01:21:20.80
So, so when you take ownership to that high level and that intensity and you call it extreme ownership,

670
01:21:20.80 --> 01:21:22.80
yeah, I think it, I think it has a huge impact.

671
01:21:22.80 --> 01:21:28.80
And I think that we are the first people that have said, you know, what this needs to be the focus.

672
01:21:28.80 --> 01:21:29.80
Right.

673
01:21:29.80 --> 01:21:30.80
This is the game changer.

674
01:21:30.80 --> 01:21:34.80
This is the fundamental principle in life that is going to turn you.

675
01:21:34.80 --> 01:21:37.80
From failure to success.

676
01:21:37.80 --> 01:21:43.80
It's not when you say, hey, this person didn't help me and this person went against me and this person sabotaged me.

677
01:21:43.80 --> 01:21:45.80
That's great, but it doesn't matter.

678
01:21:45.80 --> 01:21:51.80
When you take ownership of everything, somebody sabotaging me, I got to say, oh, I got to figure out how to stop him.

679
01:21:51.80 --> 01:21:52.80
Yeah.

680
01:21:52.80 --> 01:21:59.80
And it's just so when you, when you kind of know that or you kind of get wind to that, it almost seems so obvious.

681
01:21:59.80 --> 01:22:00.80
Yeah.

682
01:22:00.80 --> 01:22:02.80
Well, well, well, I think if I'm going to blame someone,

683
01:22:02.80 --> 01:22:05.80
so no, of course they're going to blame me back.

684
01:22:05.80 --> 01:22:09.80
If I get belligerent towards someone, of course, like a belligerent back, but you don't.

685
01:22:09.80 --> 01:22:16.80
And you already knew that really if you're asked, but it's almost like you don't think if I take ownership.

686
01:22:16.80 --> 01:22:18.80
Everyone else is going to start taking ownership.

687
01:22:18.80 --> 01:22:26.80
I don't, you know, you don't really think about that that much, even though after you know it, it seems real obvious.

688
01:22:26.80 --> 01:22:28.80
These things are simple, but not easy.

689
01:22:28.80 --> 01:22:32.80
They really are. And ownership.

690
01:22:32.80 --> 01:22:40.80
When you take ownership of problems, when you take ownership of your life and when you don't have anybody else to blame, it hurts.

691
01:22:40.80 --> 01:22:41.80
Yeah.

692
01:22:41.80 --> 01:22:42.80
It hurts.

693
01:22:42.80 --> 01:22:44.80
It hurts the ego.

694
01:22:44.80 --> 01:22:45.80
It hurts the mind.

695
01:22:45.80 --> 01:22:46.80
It hurts.

696
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:50.80
So people, even though it's really easy, I'm going to take ownership of everything.

697
01:22:50.80 --> 01:22:51.80
It's hard to do.

698
01:22:51.80 --> 01:22:55.80
It's difficult for people to do.

699
01:22:55.80 --> 01:23:05.80
And when they do do it, when they do step across that line and they do take ownership, they absolutely see things turn around.

700
01:23:05.80 --> 01:23:14.80
And I've heard that, you know, I mean, thankfully for the internet, thankfully for Twitter and Facebook and all these things, people hit me up every single day.

701
01:23:14.80 --> 01:23:16.80
And say, either, hey, this changed my life.

702
01:23:16.80 --> 01:23:21.80
But sometimes it's just something minor, you know, they'll say, had some issues that work today.

703
01:23:21.80 --> 01:23:22.80
Tilt-conorship, oval.

704
01:23:22.80 --> 01:23:23.80
Problem solved.

705
01:23:23.80 --> 01:23:27.80
So like, okay, that's great. Well, what was that person to done a month ago before they read the book?

706
01:23:27.80 --> 01:23:28.80
It would have blamed somebody else.

707
01:23:28.80 --> 01:23:29.80
It would have shifted the problem.

708
01:23:29.80 --> 01:23:31.80
You know, they would have ignored it.

709
01:23:31.80 --> 01:23:32.80
They would have cast blame somewhere else.

710
01:23:32.80 --> 01:23:34.80
And they wouldn't have solved the problem.

711
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:39.80
So when you take ownership, it allows you to then solve the problem.

712
01:23:39.80 --> 01:23:46.80
So that's what you got to do.

713
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:52.80
So now it is time for questions from the interwebs.

714
01:23:52.80 --> 01:23:54.80
Yeah.

715
01:23:54.80 --> 01:24:00.80
We actually have a current event question, which technically has never happened.

716
01:24:00.80 --> 01:24:02.80
Well, I would say it's not.

717
01:24:02.80 --> 01:24:06.80
I'll explain why it's not a current event once you ask a question.

718
01:24:06.80 --> 01:24:07.80
Right.

719
01:24:07.80 --> 01:24:08.80
Because it's not.

720
01:24:08.80 --> 01:24:10.80
Yeah, it is.

721
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:11.80
All right.

722
01:24:11.80 --> 01:24:20.80
What are your thoughts on the Conomograegor versus Nate Diaz fight and the Holly Home versus Misha Tate fight?

723
01:24:20.80 --> 01:24:24.80
Yeah, you have seen 196 this past weekend.

724
01:24:24.80 --> 01:24:27.80
Women's been to Mwate Championship on the home.

725
01:24:27.80 --> 01:24:31.80
Prisma Shatee and then it's like a super fight.

726
01:24:31.80 --> 01:24:32.80
Right.

727
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:32.80
Yeah.

728
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:32.80
Yeah.

729
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:37.80
Super fight and ideas and kind of a Gregor who's a champ at 145.

730
01:24:37.80 --> 01:24:43.80
And here's why this is not a current event's question to me.

731
01:24:43.80 --> 01:24:46.80
Because this is just a question about fighting.

732
01:24:46.80 --> 01:24:47.80
It really is.

733
01:24:47.80 --> 01:24:52.80
Because and you could say this at any time, these were good examples.

734
01:24:52.80 --> 01:24:57.80
And we'll be talking about these examples in one year, five years.

735
01:24:57.80 --> 01:25:00.80
And there's other fights that are similar examples.

736
01:25:00.80 --> 01:25:05.80
Holly Home who is a world class kickboxer and boxer.

737
01:25:05.80 --> 01:25:06.80
Yeah.

738
01:25:06.80 --> 01:25:08.80
And a very good mixed martial artists.

739
01:25:08.80 --> 01:25:11.80
However, not that great at jujitsu.

740
01:25:11.80 --> 01:25:15.80
Not horrible, not trying to bag on her because she is awesome.

741
01:25:15.80 --> 01:25:17.80
And a smart fighter too.

742
01:25:17.80 --> 01:25:20.80
Very smart with a great coach, great corner.

743
01:25:20.80 --> 01:25:28.80
She lost a Misha Tate who is definitely not as good of a striker, but who is better on the ground.

744
01:25:28.80 --> 01:25:29.80
Mm-hmm.

745
01:25:29.80 --> 01:25:30.80
Yeah.

746
01:25:30.80 --> 01:25:32.80
And she's real well around his face.

747
01:25:32.80 --> 01:25:34.80
She's extremely well around it.

748
01:25:34.80 --> 01:25:35.80
Yeah.

749
01:25:35.80 --> 01:25:36.80
She's extremely well around it.

750
01:25:36.80 --> 01:25:40.80
And she's also gotten beat twice by Ronda Rousy.

751
01:25:40.80 --> 01:25:48.80
And the strategy in those fights that she had was awful in the Misha Tate run to us.

752
01:25:48.80 --> 01:25:49.80
Yeah.

753
01:25:49.80 --> 01:25:54.80
For some reason, Misha kept clenching and grabbing and trying to take the fight to the ground against Ronda,

754
01:25:54.80 --> 01:25:57.80
which was just super cheap, clearly a better striker.

755
01:25:57.80 --> 01:25:58.80
So I don't know.

756
01:25:58.80 --> 01:26:01.80
I think that might change the next time they fight.

757
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:07.80
Misha will hopefully have a smarter game plan than trying to grapple with Ronda.

758
01:26:07.80 --> 01:26:09.80
There's no reason for it.

759
01:26:09.80 --> 01:26:10.80
Yeah.

760
01:26:10.80 --> 01:26:11.80
She's a better striker.

761
01:26:11.80 --> 01:26:12.80
She needs to take advantage of it.

762
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:13.80
Yeah.

763
01:26:13.80 --> 01:26:18.80
On the other hand, with Holly Holmes, she does get the grappling going.

764
01:26:18.80 --> 01:26:19.80
Yes.

765
01:26:19.80 --> 01:26:20.80
And not easy.

766
01:26:20.80 --> 01:26:22.80
You know, Holly Holmes is good at avoiding the take down.

767
01:26:22.80 --> 01:26:24.80
I'll send him to the ground.

768
01:26:24.80 --> 01:26:25.80
Yeah.

769
01:26:25.80 --> 01:26:26.80
Man, so good.

770
01:26:26.80 --> 01:26:28.80
But yeah, finally does it in the fifth rush.

771
01:26:28.80 --> 01:26:29.80
He had her.

772
01:26:29.80 --> 01:26:31.80
I think the end of the second round.

773
01:26:31.80 --> 01:26:32.80
Yeah.

774
01:26:32.80 --> 01:26:35.80
But, you know, the time ran out.

775
01:26:35.80 --> 01:26:40.80
And then, yeah, managed to end in the fifth round managed to get it to the ground.

776
01:26:40.80 --> 01:26:43.80
And immediately finish.

777
01:26:43.80 --> 01:26:44.80
Yeah.

778
01:26:44.80 --> 01:26:45.80
I mean, she managed.

779
01:26:45.80 --> 01:26:49.80
And it's key that you said that she managed to like get it to the ground.

780
01:26:49.80 --> 01:26:51.80
Because it wasn't a beautiful take down or anything.

781
01:26:51.80 --> 01:26:53.80
She got in on her finally.

782
01:26:53.80 --> 01:26:55.80
She had gotten stuff a couple times.

783
01:26:55.80 --> 01:26:56.80
It was.

784
01:26:56.80 --> 01:26:59.80
Holly was doing a really good job of keeping her at bay.

785
01:26:59.80 --> 01:27:01.80
And Holly was obviously scared.

786
01:27:01.80 --> 01:27:04.80
Because even the second round she got once it was on the ground,

787
01:27:04.80 --> 01:27:07.80
she got a combination by Misha.

788
01:27:07.80 --> 01:27:12.80
And then Holly didn't want to go to the ground with her again.

789
01:27:12.80 --> 01:27:14.80
But then she let her get in.

790
01:27:14.80 --> 01:27:19.80
And then like you said, Misha just forced that thing kind of drag it in an ugly way.

791
01:27:19.80 --> 01:27:21.80
Just kind of make got it to the ground.

792
01:27:21.80 --> 01:27:22.80
And once she got the ground, she got her back.

793
01:27:22.80 --> 01:27:24.80
And then once she got her back, she got her back.

794
01:27:24.80 --> 01:27:26.80
She got the choking.

795
01:27:26.80 --> 01:27:28.80
Once she got the choking.

796
01:27:28.80 --> 01:27:30.80
Holly kind of tried to flip her off.

797
01:27:30.80 --> 01:27:33.80
And.

798
01:27:33.80 --> 01:27:35.80
Even that was a little bit of a mistake.

799
01:27:35.80 --> 01:27:37.80
If Holly would have just like stood and shook her off.

800
01:27:37.80 --> 01:27:38.80
Yeah.

801
01:27:38.80 --> 01:27:39.80
Like a really good experience.

802
01:27:39.80 --> 01:27:42.80
Did you do play or might do?

803
01:27:42.80 --> 01:27:45.80
Which didn't she flipped her over and landed on her back.

804
01:27:45.80 --> 01:27:48.80
And then Misha had the the choking deep.

805
01:27:48.80 --> 01:27:50.80
And finished her and Misha's a tough.

806
01:27:50.80 --> 01:27:52.80
I mean Misha's been in some scraps before.

807
01:27:52.80 --> 01:27:54.80
She is a scrappy tough.

808
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:55.80
She's got a big heart.

809
01:27:55.80 --> 01:27:57.80
She fights with a lot of heart.

810
01:27:57.80 --> 01:27:58.80
I give her I give her some props.

811
01:27:58.80 --> 01:27:59.80
I mean, so does Holly.

812
01:27:59.80 --> 01:28:00.80
Of course.

813
01:28:00.80 --> 01:28:01.80
I mean, Holly went to sleep.

814
01:28:01.80 --> 01:28:02.80
She didn't even tap.

815
01:28:02.80 --> 01:28:03.80
She was like, what?

816
01:28:03.80 --> 01:28:04.80
No, I'm not tapping.

817
01:28:04.80 --> 01:28:05.80
Yeah.

818
01:28:05.80 --> 01:28:07.80
And you could see her instinctively started throwing.

819
01:28:07.80 --> 01:28:08.80
Yeah.

820
01:28:08.80 --> 01:28:09.80
That's the only punch is at the end.

821
01:28:09.80 --> 01:28:12.80
I mean, into the air, in the different direction.

822
01:28:12.80 --> 01:28:13.80
Because that's her.

823
01:28:13.80 --> 01:28:14.80
That's her training.

824
01:28:14.80 --> 01:28:15.80
Yeah.

825
01:28:15.80 --> 01:28:16.80
Yeah.

826
01:28:16.80 --> 01:28:17.80
That's crazy.

827
01:28:17.80 --> 01:28:18.80
How you see that all the time.

828
01:28:18.80 --> 01:28:19.80
Even when guys get knocked out.

829
01:28:19.80 --> 01:28:20.80
You ever see guys getting knocked out.

830
01:28:20.80 --> 01:28:21.80
And then start grappling.

831
01:28:21.80 --> 01:28:22.80
Yeah.

832
01:28:22.80 --> 01:28:23.80
With their eyes.

833
01:28:23.80 --> 01:28:23.80
For sure.

834
01:28:23.80 --> 01:28:24.80
With the wrath.

835
01:28:24.80 --> 01:28:25.80
For sure.

836
01:28:25.80 --> 01:28:26.80
Like that.

837
01:28:26.80 --> 01:28:27.80
Just kind of un-unconsciously doing it.

838
01:28:27.80 --> 01:28:28.80
Yeah.

839
01:28:28.80 --> 01:28:29.80
It's kind of a kind of compliment.

840
01:28:29.80 --> 01:28:30.80
Oh, it's a.

841
01:28:30.80 --> 01:28:31.80
Yeah.

842
01:28:31.80 --> 01:28:32.80
So a lot of that.

843
01:28:32.80 --> 01:28:34.80
She's throwing punches at the air.

844
01:28:34.80 --> 01:28:35.80
Yeah.

845
01:28:35.80 --> 01:28:37.80
Even though she's asleep.

846
01:28:37.80 --> 01:28:38.80
Yeah.

847
01:28:38.80 --> 01:28:39.80
So yeah.

848
01:28:39.80 --> 01:28:42.80
So in this case, straight up.

849
01:28:42.80 --> 01:28:43.80
Yeah.

850
01:28:43.80 --> 01:28:44.80
Did you do two works?

851
01:28:44.80 --> 01:28:45.80
Right?

852
01:28:45.80 --> 01:28:46.80
Yes.

853
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:47.80
Okay.

854
01:28:47.80 --> 01:28:53.80
We'll talk about to give us a debrief on the Gregor Diaz fight.

855
01:28:53.80 --> 01:28:54.80
See, that's well.

856
01:28:54.80 --> 01:28:56.80
I think it was.

857
01:28:56.80 --> 01:28:58.80
There is a lot of components.

858
01:28:58.80 --> 01:28:59.80
I think to that.

859
01:28:59.80 --> 01:29:00.80
I think.

860
01:29:00.80 --> 01:29:01.80
I think that.

861
01:29:01.80 --> 01:29:03.80
It just gives us the outlook of what happened.

862
01:29:03.80 --> 01:29:04.80
What?

863
01:29:04.80 --> 01:29:05.80
Just.

864
01:29:05.80 --> 01:29:06.80
Okay.

865
01:29:06.80 --> 01:29:07.80
Yeah.

866
01:29:07.80 --> 01:29:10.80
They fought at 170 and Nadeez is either 1-55 or.

867
01:29:10.80 --> 01:29:11.80
I think sometimes.

868
01:29:11.80 --> 01:29:12.80
He's fought.

869
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:14.80
He's fought at 170 before.

870
01:29:14.80 --> 01:29:15.80
Yeah.

871
01:29:15.80 --> 01:29:16.80
But he's.

872
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:19.80
But he's his normal weight for fighting is 155.

873
01:29:19.80 --> 01:29:20.80
So.

874
01:29:20.80 --> 01:29:21.80
So.

875
01:29:21.80 --> 01:29:22.80
Gregor's normal weight for fighting is 145.

876
01:29:22.80 --> 01:29:24.80
So he came up 10 pounds.

877
01:29:24.80 --> 01:29:27.80
But due to the late nature of the.

878
01:29:27.80 --> 01:29:30.80
And he was about they actually ended up fighting at 170.

879
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:31.80
Yeah.

880
01:29:31.80 --> 01:29:32.80
Yeah.

881
01:29:32.80 --> 01:29:34.80
So they fight and it was it was a little battle.

882
01:29:34.80 --> 01:29:37.80
And I think from what I saw.

883
01:29:37.80 --> 01:29:38.80
He was.

884
01:29:38.80 --> 01:29:40.80
It was close.

885
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:41.80
But I think.

886
01:29:41.80 --> 01:29:43.80
Conemma Gregor.

887
01:29:43.80 --> 01:29:45.80
Conem like some solid ones.

888
01:29:45.80 --> 01:29:46.80
Conem.

889
01:29:46.80 --> 01:29:47.80
Couple solid ones.

890
01:29:47.80 --> 01:29:48.80
Yeah.

891
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:49.80
Yeah.

892
01:29:49.80 --> 01:29:50.80
And then.

893
01:29:50.80 --> 01:29:51.80
Then yeah.

894
01:29:51.80 --> 01:29:52.80
Shifted.

895
01:29:52.80 --> 01:29:54.80
And then Nate started catching him and jimmy him up.

896
01:29:54.80 --> 01:29:59.80
And I think that's really what did it because he started beating him up.

897
01:29:59.80 --> 01:30:01.80
And then Conemma went for a take down.

898
01:30:01.80 --> 01:30:05.80
And that's what you typically what you do when you go for that take down the way he did.

899
01:30:05.80 --> 01:30:07.80
That's when you get beat up and you go for the clenched.

900
01:30:07.80 --> 01:30:09.80
You know, that's what boy getting beat up.

901
01:30:09.80 --> 01:30:10.80
Yes.

902
01:30:10.80 --> 01:30:11.80
Even in boxing they do that.

903
01:30:11.80 --> 01:30:12.80
You know, you get beat up.

904
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:12.80
You go for the.

905
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:14.80
So that was kind of what that kind of was.

906
01:30:14.80 --> 01:30:17.80
And in MMA you just go for the take down.

907
01:30:17.80 --> 01:30:18.80
That's kind of where it is.

908
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:19.80
So he did.

909
01:30:19.80 --> 01:30:22.80
And that's the thing that here comes the jujitsu right where he.

910
01:30:22.80 --> 01:30:25.80
And he is.

911
01:30:25.80 --> 01:30:28.80
So the reality is.

912
01:30:28.80 --> 01:30:30.80
Conemma Gregor couldn't.

913
01:30:30.80 --> 01:30:33.80
That wasn't an option for him where sure he went for the take down.

914
01:30:33.80 --> 01:30:37.80
But going to take down is even worse now because Nate did is is one of the.

915
01:30:37.80 --> 01:30:40.80
He's a really good jujitsu guy really good.

916
01:30:40.80 --> 01:30:43.80
So and kind of a Gregory still working on his jujitsu.

917
01:30:43.80 --> 01:30:48.80
Good from what I hear whatever but not like Nate is Nate is like levels above him.

918
01:30:48.80 --> 01:30:49.80
Absolutely.

919
01:30:49.80 --> 01:30:51.80
So it goes to the ground and it really shows.

920
01:30:51.80 --> 01:30:54.80
And he is kind of kind of beat up a little bit and in days.

921
01:30:54.80 --> 01:31:00.80
Now he's on the ground he has to do jujitsu now, which is that's a double double strike.

922
01:31:00.80 --> 01:31:07.80
I'm so of course he you know he takes a couple more shots and then Nate choked him up pretty pretty quick.

923
01:31:07.80 --> 01:31:09.80
Yeah, I bought him that jujitsu skill.

924
01:31:09.80 --> 01:31:12.80
And and one thing that Dia's is point now.

925
01:31:12.80 --> 01:31:16.80
But a week when they were getting interviewed and everything he says that, you know, he I've been

926
01:31:16.80 --> 01:31:21.80
or training partners in you look who I'm rolling with and look who he is rolling with. He's rolling with his brother Nick.

927
01:31:21.80 --> 01:31:24.80
He's rolling with Jake Shields who's at beast on the ground.

928
01:31:24.80 --> 01:31:29.80
I mean he's rolling with all those little badass wrestlers to he's got.

929
01:31:29.80 --> 01:31:33.80
Yeah, you got grown up there. I mean these guys are getting after it.

930
01:31:33.80 --> 01:31:34.80
You know what I mean?

931
01:31:34.80 --> 01:31:34.80
Yeah.

932
01:31:34.80 --> 01:31:35.80
And so.

933
01:31:35.80 --> 01:31:38.80
Uh, who's I mean I don't know.

934
01:31:38.80 --> 01:31:40.80
I mean he trained with Gunner or what's.

935
01:31:40.80 --> 01:31:47.80
Yeah, I mean he's going to do it.

936
01:31:47.80 --> 01:31:48.80
Yeah.

937
01:31:48.80 --> 01:31:50.80
But the thing is about the jujitsu and about the training.

938
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:55.80
The guys that you're training with all the time, that's the guy that you train with every day.

939
01:31:55.80 --> 01:31:56.80
That's what makes you good.

940
01:31:56.80 --> 01:32:00.80
Not the guy that comes out for a two week camp or a four week camp or six week camp.

941
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:02.80
That does not make you good at jujitsu.

942
01:32:02.80 --> 01:32:06.80
My sharpener one or two things, but it's not the life.

943
01:32:06.80 --> 01:32:11.80
It's not the deep daily grind with the with the masters.

944
01:32:11.80 --> 01:32:14.80
You know, that's what makes you really good.

945
01:32:14.80 --> 01:32:15.80
Yeah.

946
01:32:15.80 --> 01:32:18.80
So I think that.

947
01:32:18.80 --> 01:32:21.80
Like I said, I mean it's it's definitely.

948
01:32:21.80 --> 01:32:25.80
Showed that you're jujitsu definitely works.

949
01:32:25.80 --> 01:32:29.80
Uh, and it also shows you how.

950
01:32:29.80 --> 01:32:33.80
Hard it is to get good at how much harder it is to get good at.

951
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:36.80
At Shiregmeenie Misha.

952
01:32:36.80 --> 01:32:39.80
No, she was not dominating, but she was surviving on the stand up.

953
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:40.80
You know what I mean?

954
01:32:40.80 --> 01:32:42.80
And it's a world class strike.

955
01:32:42.80 --> 01:32:45.80
I mean, she's she's definitely a better striker.

956
01:32:45.80 --> 01:32:47.80
Then Misha Tate is a grappler.

957
01:32:47.80 --> 01:32:52.80
I mean, Misha Tate doesn't have any tremendous accolades as a grappler.

958
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:56.80
She's a high level MMA grappler, but she's not a world champion grappler.

959
01:32:56.80 --> 01:32:57.80
Right.

960
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:01.80
And yet, you know, she was able to hang because

961
01:33:01.80 --> 01:33:11.80
striking is a for the most part from a fought perspective is a linear fought pattern of throwing strikes in another human.

962
01:33:11.80 --> 01:33:15.80
Grappling is way infinitely more complex infinitely.

963
01:33:15.80 --> 01:33:17.80
It's infinitely more complex.

964
01:33:17.80 --> 01:33:18.80
Yeah.

965
01:33:18.80 --> 01:33:21.80
And so you have to learn it earlier.

966
01:33:21.80 --> 01:33:26.80
And if you want to.

967
01:33:26.80 --> 01:33:31.80
And it makes something up. I mean, because striking striking has an element of luck to it.

968
01:33:31.80 --> 01:33:34.80
Yeah. I don't care what you say is striking has, I mean,

969
01:33:34.80 --> 01:33:38.80
when a when two MMA fighters go on the cage, there's not a guy that says, hey,

970
01:33:38.80 --> 01:33:40.80
I can definitely knock this guy out.

971
01:33:40.80 --> 01:33:42.80
There's absolutely luck.

972
01:33:42.80 --> 01:33:45.80
There's knockouts or sell them even in boxing.

973
01:33:45.80 --> 01:33:47.80
Yeah, where the whole object is a punchy other guy.

974
01:33:47.80 --> 01:33:51.80
And they had not come out when I was a rear naked choke is a rear naked choke.

975
01:33:51.80 --> 01:33:51.80
Yeah.

976
01:33:51.80 --> 01:33:54.60
You know, it's a renegade joke.

977
01:33:54.60 --> 01:34:00.60
It is a very, very assured weapon

978
01:34:00.60 --> 01:34:03.08
to be utilizing in those situations.

979
01:34:03.08 --> 01:34:04.96
I remember one time I was talking to Hannah,

980
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:06.28
Hannah Gracie.

981
01:34:06.28 --> 01:34:08.44
He just made a real small short comparison

982
01:34:08.44 --> 01:34:09.64
to I think it was boxing.

983
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:14.36
He said, the average person can walk into a boxing gym

984
01:34:14.36 --> 01:34:17.12
and rock someone and knock him out.

985
01:34:17.12 --> 01:34:18.68
He used the word he and rock someone.

986
01:34:18.68 --> 01:34:21.20
If he just swings for the fences, right?

987
01:34:21.20 --> 01:34:23.04
And that is possible.

988
01:34:23.04 --> 01:34:25.60
But Jiu Jitsu, when you can't really do that,

989
01:34:25.60 --> 01:34:29.04
you can't really a new guy come in as a white belt

990
01:34:29.04 --> 01:34:32.12
and just go real hard and say somehow catch someone.

991
01:34:32.12 --> 01:34:34.68
Yeah, and this is one of these submissions.

992
01:34:34.68 --> 01:34:37.28
So yeah, and once you learn that,

993
01:34:37.28 --> 01:34:39.68
you and the other guy doesn't know it

994
01:34:39.68 --> 01:34:41.68
and he hasn't learned it or hasn't learned it,

995
01:34:41.68 --> 01:34:44.000
even close to how much you've learned it.

996
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.68
It's that, it's that easy, really.

997
01:34:46.68 --> 01:34:49.32
It's the, and really the best way to say it is,

998
01:34:49.32 --> 01:34:52.12
you have that much control over the fight you do.

999
01:34:52.12 --> 01:34:55.64
Now, the thing is I don't wanna make like all of a sudden,

1000
01:34:57.24 --> 01:35:00.24
Jiu Jitsu by itself is the all powerful thing,

1001
01:35:00.24 --> 01:35:04.92
because you can't discount the dozens and dozens

1002
01:35:04.92 --> 01:35:08.16
and dozens of Jiu Jitsu people

1003
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:09.32
that have been beaten in MMA.

1004
01:35:09.32 --> 01:35:10.32
They've been beaten down.

1005
01:35:10.32 --> 01:35:11.76
They've been knocked out that have been,

1006
01:35:11.76 --> 01:35:13.28
they're shot stuff.

1007
01:35:13.28 --> 01:35:18.28
So there's no doubt about that, but it's,

1008
01:35:21.84 --> 01:35:26.84
it is definitely the skill that you have to have

1009
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.52
in this day and age for mixed martial arts for sure.

1010
01:35:31.52 --> 01:35:34.28
I mean, without it, you could beat.

1011
01:35:34.28 --> 01:35:36.20
And without it, you would you have as you have C1

1012
01:35:36.20 --> 01:35:37.20
and you have C2.

1013
01:35:37.20 --> 01:35:39.56
And Jiu Jitsu just beats the other martial arts,

1014
01:35:39.56 --> 01:35:41.56
whether it's wrestling or it's boxing, it doesn't matter.

1015
01:35:41.56 --> 01:35:46.56
You know, but you do have to train everything.

1016
01:35:46.56 --> 01:35:49.32
I mean, and Jiu Jitsu takes the longest to learn,

1017
01:35:49.32 --> 01:35:51.12
there's the most to learn, so you should start with it,

1018
01:35:51.12 --> 01:35:52.72
but you gotta know how to wrestle.

1019
01:35:52.72 --> 01:35:54.24
You know, you gotta know Moitai.

1020
01:35:57.04 --> 01:35:58.16
And that's the way it is.

1021
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:00.44
Yeah, and when you have that much of a discrepancy

1022
01:36:00.44 --> 01:36:04.48
between like a certain element of people's game,

1023
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:09.20
like in, and I think Jiu Jitsu tends to be the more prevalent,

1024
01:36:09.20 --> 01:36:11.000
because a lot of times people would be like,

1025
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.40
oh, well, certain guys, let's say like a chocolate

1026
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:16.52
or a clay guida, they're like, hey, these aren't,

1027
01:36:16.52 --> 01:36:18.84
well, actually, we'll just say chocolate del.

1028
01:36:18.84 --> 01:36:20.52
He's not necessarily a Jiu Jitsu Black belt,

1029
01:36:20.52 --> 01:36:21.48
and he was championing whatever,

1030
01:36:21.48 --> 01:36:23.64
but the thing is he had wrestling background,

1031
01:36:23.64 --> 01:36:26.24
so he had grappling, but he knew about Jiu Jitsu.

1032
01:36:26.24 --> 01:36:27.08
Yeah, for sure.

1033
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:29.92
He knew about like where the arm bar comes from,

1034
01:36:29.92 --> 01:36:31.76
where the jokes come from, how to defend the joke,

1035
01:36:31.76 --> 01:36:33.60
how to dig in all these things.

1036
01:36:33.60 --> 01:36:37.36
So knowing Jiu Jitsu saying like you need to know Jiu Jitsu

1037
01:36:37.36 --> 01:36:40.04
doesn't necessarily mean you gotta be a black belt in Jiu Jitsu,

1038
01:36:40.04 --> 01:36:42.80
or you have to have the slickest sharpest submissions

1039
01:36:42.80 --> 01:36:43.88
necessarily.

1040
01:36:43.88 --> 01:36:45.88
You just have to know Jiu Jitsu,

1041
01:36:45.88 --> 01:36:49.08
and if you don't know it or know very little,

1042
01:36:49.08 --> 01:36:53.60
you, I'd say the chances of you getting exposed is really high.

1043
01:36:53.60 --> 01:36:54.44
Yeah.

1044
01:36:55.80 --> 01:36:56.64
I agree with you.

1045
01:36:56.64 --> 01:36:59.64
And I think these just so happened last night

1046
01:36:59.64 --> 01:37:02.76
that those fights exemplified that.

1047
01:37:02.76 --> 01:37:06.000
I agree with you.

1048
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.60
Gotta know the Jiu Jitsu.

1049
01:37:08.80 --> 01:37:10.68
As I was listening to your recent podcast,

1050
01:37:10.68 --> 01:37:13.64
I thought that of a few topics you could discuss,

1051
01:37:13.64 --> 01:37:16.64
that would be good and helpful for your young guys.

1052
01:37:16.64 --> 01:37:19.08
I wanna join the military and go special ups.

1053
01:37:20.28 --> 01:37:22.72
I know that buds and other training

1054
01:37:22.72 --> 01:37:26.16
are just baseline entry level schools,

1055
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:28.12
but in my experience,

1056
01:37:28.12 --> 01:37:30.88
those stories are what get guys excited and fired up.

1057
01:37:30.88 --> 01:37:35.88
So, you know, guy wants to hear about buds stories

1058
01:37:35.88 --> 01:37:40.88
and what it's like going through those stories.

1059
01:37:40.88 --> 01:37:42.76
Through those types of training

1060
01:37:42.76 --> 01:37:45.28
because it gets people excited and fired up.

1061
01:37:45.28 --> 01:37:51.20
Well, there's actually kind of a reason

1062
01:37:51.20 --> 01:37:56.000
why I don't sit around and talk about buds,

1063
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.20
which is basic seal,

1064
01:37:57.20 --> 01:37:58.44
basic underwater demolitions,

1065
01:37:58.44 --> 01:37:59.28
you know, training.

1066
01:37:59.28 --> 01:38:00.20
There's reason I don't sit around

1067
01:38:00.20 --> 01:38:01.80
and talk about it a bunch.

1068
01:38:02.88 --> 01:38:07.64
One of those reasons is because buds is not the seal teams.

1069
01:38:07.64 --> 01:38:09.64
At all, and it doesn't mean anything.

1070
01:38:09.64 --> 01:38:12.60
And I try and say that as often as I can,

1071
01:38:12.60 --> 01:38:14.92
because I don't want people to get the impression

1072
01:38:14.92 --> 01:38:19.92
that the seal teams is the little initial training

1073
01:38:21.44 --> 01:38:24.72
that is barely even a fraction of your career

1074
01:38:24.72 --> 01:38:25.72
in the seal teams.

1075
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:27.84
And it has nothing to do with what you actually do

1076
01:38:27.84 --> 01:38:30.44
when you get in the seal teams.

1077
01:38:30.44 --> 01:38:33.12
I also don't want,

1078
01:38:34.12 --> 01:38:35.08
and this is an intentional,

1079
01:38:35.08 --> 01:38:36.76
this is more a response to the question,

1080
01:38:36.76 --> 01:38:41.16
but I don't tell stories to get guys fired up

1081
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:43.80
to join the military about buds

1082
01:38:43.80 --> 01:38:45.36
because that isn't what the seal teams is.

1083
01:38:45.36 --> 01:38:47.44
That's not what an SF ODA team is.

1084
01:38:47.44 --> 01:38:49.88
That's not what Ranger Battalion is.

1085
01:38:49.88 --> 01:38:54.60
Ranger Battalion and SF is not the selection course

1086
01:38:54.60 --> 01:38:56.64
to that you go through to get into them.

1087
01:38:56.64 --> 01:38:58.60
That's not what the job is.

1088
01:38:58.60 --> 01:39:02.96
And you shouldn't be joining the military

1089
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:05.52
and shouldn't be trying to get into special operations

1090
01:39:05.52 --> 01:39:07.64
because you want to do that training.

1091
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:10.64
You should do the training

1092
01:39:10.64 --> 01:39:12.32
because you want to do the job.

1093
01:39:14.32 --> 01:39:18.88
You want to do the actual job of being in special operations

1094
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:21.40
and being in special forces and being in the Rangers

1095
01:39:21.40 --> 01:39:23.96
and being in Marsock and being in the seal teams.

1096
01:39:23.96 --> 01:39:26.20
You just want to do that job.

1097
01:39:29.44 --> 01:39:33.000
And if you want to do that job,

1098
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.76
what it really boils down to

1099
01:39:35.76 --> 01:39:37.80
isn't running or rocking or pull ups

1100
01:39:37.80 --> 01:39:39.40
or swimming or any of that crap,

1101
01:39:39.40 --> 01:39:42.04
it boils down to whether you have the two wheels

1102
01:39:42.04 --> 01:39:45.68
that I talk about that war is determined by.

1103
01:39:49.56 --> 01:39:53.72
And that is the will to kill

1104
01:39:53.72 --> 01:39:56.80
because that is the entire premise of your job.

1105
01:39:57.80 --> 01:40:00.56
If you're in the military at all,

1106
01:40:01.96 --> 01:40:06.96
you may be somehow supporting that.

1107
01:40:07.72 --> 01:40:09.04
If you're in the military,

1108
01:40:09.04 --> 01:40:11.96
but the ultimate goal of the military

1109
01:40:11.96 --> 01:40:14.24
is to kill the bad guys.

1110
01:40:15.40 --> 01:40:17.68
And if you're going to be in special operations,

1111
01:40:17.68 --> 01:40:19.96
you're going to be on the tip of the spear of that.

1112
01:40:20.88 --> 01:40:23.04
So you absolutely have to make sure

1113
01:40:23.04 --> 01:40:25.20
that you have the will to kill.

1114
01:40:28.44 --> 01:40:30.88
And you also, obviously,

1115
01:40:30.88 --> 01:40:33.08
if you're going to join special operations

1116
01:40:33.08 --> 01:40:35.12
or you want to be in the seal teams,

1117
01:40:36.88 --> 01:40:40.56
you have to have the will to die.

1118
01:40:41.72 --> 01:40:45.40
Not that you want to die, not that you want to be a martyr,

1119
01:40:45.40 --> 01:40:49.36
not that you're freaking suicidal or anything like that.

1120
01:40:49.36 --> 01:40:51.92
But you absolutely have to make sure

1121
01:40:51.92 --> 01:40:56.92
that you have the williness to die.

1122
01:40:58.80 --> 01:41:00.48
And I would say put your life on the line,

1123
01:41:00.48 --> 01:41:01.84
but no, I'm going beyond that.

1124
01:41:01.84 --> 01:41:04.44
I'm talking about the williness to die.

1125
01:41:07.72 --> 01:41:10.16
Because if you join special operations

1126
01:41:10.16 --> 01:41:12.12
or you join the seal teams,

1127
01:41:13.20 --> 01:41:15.88
or you join any of the combat arms

1128
01:41:15.88 --> 01:41:18.04
in the army or in the Marine Corps,

1129
01:41:18.04 --> 01:41:23.04
you will be asked to put your life on the line.

1130
01:41:27.04 --> 01:41:30.04
And you've got to be ready to do that.

1131
01:41:32.20 --> 01:41:34.20
You've got to have that will.

1132
01:41:35.36 --> 01:41:38.24
You've got to be ready to make that commitment.

1133
01:41:42.96 --> 01:41:44.88
And I mean, the training,

1134
01:41:44.88 --> 01:41:49.88
if you have that will to kill and you have that will to die,

1135
01:41:51.24 --> 01:41:54.60
the training, Ron, Swim, DuPoosh,

1136
01:41:54.60 --> 01:41:55.56
upstupal, upstupal, upstip,

1137
01:41:55.56 --> 01:41:57.76
upstip, rope, climb, to do flutter kicks.

1138
01:41:58.76 --> 01:42:04.24
All that stuff is the easy part.

1139
01:42:08.64 --> 01:42:10.96
And so if you're sitting there and you see

1140
01:42:10.96 --> 01:42:13.52
seal training on TV and you think,

1141
01:42:13.52 --> 01:42:15.000
oh, that'd be cool.

1142
01:42:16.52 --> 01:42:19.84
Don't think about that as what being a seal is

1143
01:42:19.84 --> 01:42:21.40
because it is not.

1144
01:42:23.08 --> 01:42:24.64
That is just the selection.

1145
01:42:25.64 --> 01:42:27.92
It's just the weeding out of the week.

1146
01:42:31.84 --> 01:42:33.32
If you want to be a seal,

1147
01:42:33.32 --> 01:42:35.56
means you want to be a commando.

1148
01:42:35.56 --> 01:42:37.76
Means you want to go into arms away.

1149
01:42:37.76 --> 01:42:40.000
It means you want to meet the enemy

1150
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
on the field of battle.

1151
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.32
That's what being a seal is.

1152
01:42:52.84 --> 01:42:56.20
And that's why I really don't sit around

1153
01:42:56.20 --> 01:42:57.76
and tell bud stories.

1154
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:06.80
I don't think I have too much more to say about that one.

1155
01:43:06.80 --> 01:43:07.76
I'm sure at some point,

1156
01:43:07.76 --> 01:43:10.000
I mean, there's funny things that happen in Buds.

1157
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.04
I mean, of course, but there's just compared to

1158
01:43:13.04 --> 01:43:14.20
what happens in a seal.

1159
01:43:14.20 --> 01:43:15.76
But two and there's just no big deal.

1160
01:43:15.76 --> 01:43:16.60
Yeah.

1161
01:43:17.80 --> 01:43:18.80
Yeah, that's interesting.

1162
01:43:18.80 --> 01:43:21.20
You put it, don't, don't do it.

1163
01:43:21.20 --> 01:43:22.84
Because you want to go through that training.

1164
01:43:22.84 --> 01:43:23.84
Yeah.

1165
01:43:23.84 --> 01:43:24.64
Do it too.

1166
01:43:24.64 --> 01:43:25.40
You want to do it, Joe.

1167
01:43:25.40 --> 01:43:26.28
Yeah.

1168
01:43:26.28 --> 01:43:28.16
That's a big, that's a big mistake.

1169
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:30.24
Maybe I can help some people out that are out there

1170
01:43:30.24 --> 01:43:32.48
right now thinking, oh, I'd really like to go through that training.

1171
01:43:33.60 --> 01:43:36.16
No, don't do it to go through the training.

1172
01:43:36.16 --> 01:43:38.88
Go do it because you want to do that job.

1173
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:45.72
Is it true they take a pin and they stick it in your skin

1174
01:43:45.72 --> 01:43:48.36
and clip it on your skin.

1175
01:43:48.36 --> 01:43:49.48
Did you do that?

1176
01:43:49.48 --> 01:43:50.96
Well, when you get your try done,

1177
01:43:50.96 --> 01:43:55.80
yeah, it has like three little prongs that go out the back of it

1178
01:43:55.80 --> 01:43:58.12
to stick it under your uniform.

1179
01:43:58.12 --> 01:43:59.40
And when you get your try done, yeah,

1180
01:43:59.40 --> 01:44:01.000
they put it like into your skin.

1181
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:01.52
Yeah.

1182
01:44:01.52 --> 01:44:03.20
It's like you're standing there with no shirt.

1183
01:44:03.20 --> 01:44:05.64
They're like, oh, like they're in and then they punch it in.

1184
01:44:05.64 --> 01:44:08.60
And then everybody, when I went, when I got my try,

1185
01:44:08.60 --> 01:44:12.36
I didn't the whole team lined up and everyone punch you right in the chest

1186
01:44:12.36 --> 01:44:13.20
until you just bleed.

1187
01:44:13.20 --> 01:44:14.88
Never learn a big bruise on your chest.

1188
01:44:18.88 --> 01:44:20.64
Next question.

1189
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:24.92
Do you have experience with people telling you that you're too intense?

1190
01:44:29.76 --> 01:44:33.88
Or that you need to work on not being so upfront and straightforward?

1191
01:44:33.88 --> 01:44:37.24
Sometimes it's called working on your how.

1192
01:44:37.24 --> 01:44:41.64
I think it would be great to hear how you could apply this using extreme ownership.

1193
01:44:41.64 --> 01:44:45.000
In the business world, there is a big push on diversity,

1194
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.40
which is wonderful.

1195
01:44:46.40 --> 01:44:51.80
But often it comes with also diversifying away from intensity

1196
01:44:51.80 --> 01:44:53.84
and male aggression, quote unquote.

1197
01:44:53.84 --> 01:44:54.72
I'd love your thoughts.

1198
01:44:58.36 --> 01:45:02.60
Well, this is, it's kind of interesting to get this question.

1199
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:05.56
It's kind of strange to get this question because all the time,

1200
01:45:05.56 --> 01:45:11.72
when I talk about leadership, I talk about how often do you hear me say,

1201
01:45:11.72 --> 01:45:14.96
take the indirect approach to something?

1202
01:45:14.96 --> 01:45:18.12
I always talk about the indirect approach,

1203
01:45:18.12 --> 01:45:22.88
because the direct approach is not due to the direct approach

1204
01:45:22.88 --> 01:45:26.64
is beating your head and punching someone in the face.

1205
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:29.48
So I'm always talking about using the indirect approach.

1206
01:45:29.48 --> 01:45:36.48
So it's very nature indirect is not straightforward.

1207
01:45:37.60 --> 01:45:40.60
It's not intense.

1208
01:45:40.60 --> 01:45:44.12
So no, I don't have people telling me I'm too intense

1209
01:45:44.12 --> 01:45:45.44
or I'm too straightforward.

1210
01:45:45.44 --> 01:45:47.16
Why don't I have them telling me that?

1211
01:45:47.16 --> 01:45:48.12
Because I'm not.

1212
01:45:50.60 --> 01:45:51.44
I'm not.

1213
01:45:51.44 --> 01:45:53.04
And I'm not saying that I'm not intense.

1214
01:45:53.04 --> 01:45:55.08
I'm not saying that I'm not straightforward.

1215
01:45:55.08 --> 01:46:00.84
But I'm very, very careful not to go too far with either.

1216
01:46:00.84 --> 01:46:04.04
This is like a fighter that's swinging too hard

1217
01:46:04.04 --> 01:46:06.52
or being too predictable or just will stand and trade

1218
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:09.08
and take damage.

1219
01:46:09.08 --> 01:46:11.68
And do damage.

1220
01:46:11.68 --> 01:46:13.08
That's the direct approach.

1221
01:46:13.08 --> 01:46:16.12
The direct approach is I punch you in the face and you punch me

1222
01:46:16.12 --> 01:46:19.88
in the face and we play a war of attrition.

1223
01:46:19.88 --> 01:46:24.52
I don't want to enter into a war of attrition.

1224
01:46:24.52 --> 01:46:27.48
I do not want to enter into a war of attrition.

1225
01:46:27.48 --> 01:46:30.20
I want to use a maneuver warfare.

1226
01:46:30.20 --> 01:46:31.64
I want to move.

1227
01:46:31.64 --> 01:46:36.88
I want to slip unseen into the weak areas

1228
01:46:36.88 --> 01:46:39.48
and set my bombs and have them go off.

1229
01:46:42.28 --> 01:46:44.20
So I just got this ass this the other night

1230
01:46:44.20 --> 01:46:46.20
by a relatively new client of mine.

1231
01:46:46.20 --> 01:46:48.60
You know, are you going to get in their faces

1232
01:46:48.60 --> 01:46:51.44
and getting the faces of the leadership

1233
01:46:51.44 --> 01:46:53.64
and don't straight up that they need to get their act together.

1234
01:46:53.64 --> 01:46:56.16
And you could see that this person was very excited

1235
01:46:56.16 --> 01:46:58.32
by that idea.

1236
01:46:58.32 --> 01:47:00.24
And it was one of the senior leaders in that.

1237
01:47:00.24 --> 01:47:01.08
That was that.

1238
01:47:01.08 --> 01:47:03.12
You had this idea that I was going to come in

1239
01:47:03.12 --> 01:47:07.88
and just get in their faces and tell them how screwed up they were.

1240
01:47:07.88 --> 01:47:12.88
And I said, no, I likely will not do that.

1241
01:47:14.64 --> 01:47:15.96
And then I said, tell them, I said, look,

1242
01:47:15.96 --> 01:47:17.56
what if I told you that you were all screwed up

1243
01:47:17.56 --> 01:47:19.000
and you were a failure at your job

1244
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.60
and you do your weak leader?

1245
01:47:20.60 --> 01:47:25.60
What would you then be feel like you really wanted to listen to me?

1246
01:47:27.76 --> 01:47:30.88
What would you, would you be open to my suggestions

1247
01:47:30.88 --> 01:47:31.72
at that point?

1248
01:47:31.72 --> 01:47:34.000
Do you think I'd be an efficient coach?

1249
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Do you think I would even appear as an intelligent human being?

1250
01:47:39.56 --> 01:47:42.60
If the best I could do to coach you

1251
01:47:42.60 --> 01:47:45.24
was to tell you that you sucked as a leader

1252
01:47:45.24 --> 01:47:46.72
and you were a failure at your job

1253
01:47:46.72 --> 01:47:48.000
and you're screwing everything up.

1254
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And obviously the answers were no, no, no, of course not.

1255
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I would be a horrible coach.

1256
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.80
I would be a horrible leader myself

1257
01:47:58.80 --> 01:48:01.20
if that's what I resorted to.

1258
01:48:02.80 --> 01:48:06.48
And most importantly, if I want you to change

1259
01:48:07.48 --> 01:48:11.96
and the way I'm trying to get you to train

1260
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:15.32
is by being abusive

1261
01:48:15.32 --> 01:48:19.72
and begging you to send up your defenses

1262
01:48:19.72 --> 01:48:22.88
and not listen to me, what the hell good am I doing?

1263
01:48:23.88 --> 01:48:28.88
Why would I do anything that's going to inhibit my goal?

1264
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:30.84
Which my goal is to get you to change,

1265
01:48:30.84 --> 01:48:32.48
get you to be a better leader?

1266
01:48:34.08 --> 01:48:36.36
So if I slap you in the face

1267
01:48:38.20 --> 01:48:41.84
with aggression or with straight forwardness

1268
01:48:41.84 --> 01:48:45.84
that makes you defensive, how does that help me?

1269
01:48:48.44 --> 01:48:50.20
The answer is it doesn't, now again,

1270
01:48:50.20 --> 01:48:51.88
that doesn't mean that I'm never straight forward

1271
01:48:51.88 --> 01:48:53.80
and then I'm never aggressive

1272
01:48:53.80 --> 01:48:56.76
but I calculate those moments.

1273
01:48:59.72 --> 01:49:02.44
I calculate those moments.

1274
01:49:02.44 --> 01:49:07.44
There's a reason why we sugarcoat medicine

1275
01:49:07.44 --> 01:49:08.60
for a little children.

1276
01:49:09.92 --> 01:49:10.76
Right?

1277
01:49:10.76 --> 01:49:12.44
There is, why is it?

1278
01:49:12.44 --> 01:49:14.44
So they take it.

1279
01:49:14.44 --> 01:49:17.000
It's so they take it into their system.

1280
01:49:18.76 --> 01:49:21.80
And it's the same thing with adults.

1281
01:49:21.80 --> 01:49:23.92
And people say don't sugarcoat it don't,

1282
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:26.40
you know, just tell me how it is, they don't mean it.

1283
01:49:29.04 --> 01:49:30.84
They want it sugarcoded

1284
01:49:32.20 --> 01:49:35.12
because they want to accept it into their body.

1285
01:49:35.12 --> 01:49:40.12
It's just like you, Jitsu, you need to use Jitsu,

1286
01:49:40.12 --> 01:49:44.12
you need to set things up, you need to manipulate.

1287
01:49:45.68 --> 01:49:48.48
To get people to do what you want to do,

1288
01:49:48.48 --> 01:49:51.48
especially if it has to do with them changing themselves.

1289
01:49:53.16 --> 01:49:55.88
One of the worst ways to get someone to change

1290
01:49:55.88 --> 01:49:58.76
is by telling them exactly how you want them to change.

1291
01:49:59.96 --> 01:50:01.44
I mean, of course, there's a situation

1292
01:50:01.44 --> 01:50:02.92
we have this beautiful relationship

1293
01:50:02.92 --> 01:50:04.56
and you've built it with someone you have this

1294
01:50:04.56 --> 01:50:07.44
intimate trust with another human being.

1295
01:50:08.44 --> 01:50:11.36
I don't think I have that with anybody.

1296
01:50:13.20 --> 01:50:15.52
But there have been situations in my life where I've had,

1297
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:17.60
oh, just complete, utter trust with,

1298
01:50:17.60 --> 01:50:19.20
you know, maybe there's three or four people

1299
01:50:19.20 --> 01:50:21.72
that I have that with in my whole life

1300
01:50:21.72 --> 01:50:23.52
that I can just say, listen man, here's the deal.

1301
01:50:24.52 --> 01:50:26.08
Don't get defensive, here's what's going on,

1302
01:50:26.08 --> 01:50:28.16
here's what you need to do adjust.

1303
01:50:28.16 --> 01:50:31.56
Very few people, do you have that relationship in life?

1304
01:50:31.56 --> 01:50:32.56
So you gotta use that nuance and that maneuver warfare.

1305
01:50:43.84 --> 01:50:45.20
And it's the same thing with aggression.

1306
01:50:45.20 --> 01:50:48.28
It's the same thing that we just read in this article.

1307
01:50:48.28 --> 01:50:50.32
Don't yell at the Cheshire people,

1308
01:50:50.32 --> 01:50:52.92
you're not going to be able to get what you want from them.

1309
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.36
And like I said, it doesn't just apply to those people

1310
01:50:56.36 --> 01:50:58.12
and applies to all people.

1311
01:50:58.12 --> 01:51:03.12
You gotta bring people in and you gotta manipulate them

1312
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:05.32
and I know that again, that has negative connotations

1313
01:51:05.32 --> 01:51:07.56
but it's what you're doing, you're trying to get someone

1314
01:51:07.56 --> 01:51:09.68
to think a different way, that's manipulation.

1315
01:51:09.68 --> 01:51:11.36
You call it, influence, you call whatever you want,

1316
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:13.24
but that's what you're trying to do.

1317
01:51:13.24 --> 01:51:15.28
And the most difficult way to manipulate someone

1318
01:51:15.28 --> 01:51:17.60
is to slap them in the face with aggression.

1319
01:51:21.56 --> 01:51:24.76
So there's a little dichotomy here, of course,

1320
01:51:24.76 --> 01:51:28.52
because I would say the default mode has to be aggressive,

1321
01:51:29.64 --> 01:51:33.84
but I don't mean necessarily overtly aggressive.

1322
01:51:33.84 --> 01:51:36.88
It means that you're aggressively forcing things

1323
01:51:36.88 --> 01:51:39.52
to go in your direction.

1324
01:51:39.52 --> 01:51:41.56
Through every means necessary,

1325
01:51:41.56 --> 01:51:45.000
through overt and covert and client-design.

1326
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
And honestly, the preferred method of all is covert.

1327
01:51:50.76 --> 01:51:53.04
The preferred method for me to get echoed

1328
01:51:53.04 --> 01:51:56.32
and do something different is for echoed

1329
01:51:56.32 --> 01:51:59.76
to never even think I had an opinion on it.

1330
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:02.60
It's for me just to sneak in there,

1331
01:52:02.60 --> 01:52:06.76
behind enemy lines, plant the seeds,

1332
01:52:06.76 --> 01:52:10.08
and let them grow and let echo come to the conclusion

1333
01:52:11.36 --> 01:52:13.08
that you're gonna change the way you're doing something,

1334
01:52:13.08 --> 01:52:16.84
you're gonna think differently about something.

1335
01:52:16.84 --> 01:52:21.84
That's leadership, that's real leadership.

1336
01:52:25.12 --> 01:52:28.96
So that's what you gotta work on.

1337
01:52:30.28 --> 01:52:34.56
If somebody is telling you you're two and 10s

1338
01:52:34.56 --> 01:52:38.40
and you're two aggressive, guess what, you are.

1339
01:52:38.40 --> 01:52:43.40
You're giving away your greatest weapon.

1340
01:52:48.12 --> 01:52:50.48
You're advertising your attack.

1341
01:52:51.84 --> 01:52:56.12
Surprise is one of the most key components

1342
01:52:57.36 --> 01:52:58.20
in a battle.

1343
01:52:59.20 --> 01:53:02.76
And when you tell people aggressively

1344
01:53:02.76 --> 01:53:08.76
and overtly what you're doing,

1345
01:53:08.76 --> 01:53:10.44
you're giving up that element.

1346
01:53:10.44 --> 01:53:12.08
Don't do it.

1347
01:53:12.08 --> 01:53:17.72
I'm asking you not to be a manipulative person

1348
01:53:17.72 --> 01:53:22.72
behind the scenes with weird plans.

1349
01:53:27.96 --> 01:53:29.92
But that is what I'm asking you to do.

1350
01:53:29.92 --> 01:53:33.76
That's is what I'm asking you to do,

1351
01:53:33.76 --> 01:53:36.16
because that is how you get things done.

1352
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:38.32
That is how you get into people's minds.

1353
01:53:38.32 --> 01:53:40.24
That is how you lead.

1354
01:53:43.56 --> 01:53:48.24
Not by yelling, not by being overly aggressive,

1355
01:53:48.24 --> 01:53:52.28
not by being so intense that people don't want to listen

1356
01:53:52.28 --> 01:53:55.48
to you, because intensity is a form of emotion, right?

1357
01:53:55.48 --> 01:53:59.36
And the minute you come across as an emotional intense maniac,

1358
01:53:59.36 --> 01:54:02.60
people are questioning already your validity.

1359
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:05.84
This guy should two intense.

1360
01:54:05.84 --> 01:54:07.36
Don't be that guy.

1361
01:54:09.36 --> 01:54:14.36
Manipulate influence, be clandestine, covert,

1362
01:54:16.24 --> 01:54:19.28
and that is how you win.

1363
01:54:22.12 --> 01:54:24.56
The reason that I was kind of laughing,

1364
01:54:25.80 --> 01:54:27.36
was reading this question is,

1365
01:54:27.36 --> 01:54:30.76
that it kind of makes sense from someone

1366
01:54:30.76 --> 01:54:31.92
who's kind of from the outside.

1367
01:54:31.92 --> 01:54:35.16
And the main times when me personally,

1368
01:54:35.16 --> 01:54:39.16
where I would view you as being intense or aggressive

1369
01:54:39.16 --> 01:54:43.96
or is like when you're just talking about something,

1370
01:54:43.96 --> 01:54:46.28
you're never doing it towards anybody.

1371
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:48.60
You'll never lose it.

1372
01:54:48.60 --> 01:54:53.60
I've never, then I've known you since 06, I think,

1373
01:54:53.60 --> 01:54:56.60
something like that.

1374
01:54:56.60 --> 01:54:59.28
Yeah, and I've never seen you lose your temper,

1375
01:54:59.28 --> 01:55:00.12
get mad.

1376
01:55:00.12 --> 01:55:01.96
I mean, kind of one time,

1377
01:55:01.96 --> 01:55:03.76
this one I was talking to,

1378
01:55:03.76 --> 01:55:04.56
lay for about it.

1379
01:55:04.56 --> 01:55:06.36
We've never really seen you get mad,

1380
01:55:06.36 --> 01:55:08.28
but maybe one or two times.

1381
01:55:08.28 --> 01:55:11.16
You have this aggressive and intense persona,

1382
01:55:11.16 --> 01:55:12.000
for sure.

1383
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.24
And when you talk about things for sure,

1384
01:55:14.24 --> 01:55:16.36
but yeah, when you're dealing with people,

1385
01:55:16.36 --> 01:55:23.36
it's real basically the way you'd want to be engaged.

1386
01:55:23.36 --> 01:55:24.60
You know, another human.

1387
01:55:24.60 --> 01:55:24.96
Yeah.

1388
01:55:24.96 --> 01:55:25.96
Yeah.

1389
01:55:25.96 --> 01:55:26.80
It's just,

1390
01:55:26.80 --> 01:55:29.48
who wants to have somebody get aggressive with them.

1391
01:55:29.48 --> 01:55:32.44
It's never, it never, the only time it works,

1392
01:55:32.44 --> 01:55:34.36
like if you're handling a prisoner,

1393
01:55:34.36 --> 01:55:37.56
like literally, if I'm handling a prisoner,

1394
01:55:37.56 --> 01:55:39.60
I'll be aggressive with them.

1395
01:55:39.60 --> 01:55:39.96
Yeah.

1396
01:55:39.96 --> 01:55:43.28
If I'm trying to get command of a,

1397
01:55:43.28 --> 01:55:47.08
of a chaotic situation, and there's a,

1398
01:55:47.08 --> 01:55:49.84
there's another aggressor in the situation,

1399
01:55:49.84 --> 01:55:52.92
I might have to be more aggressive than that person.

1400
01:55:52.92 --> 01:55:57.84
But any normal situation dealing with human beings,

1401
01:55:57.84 --> 01:56:01.84
aggression isn't a attribute.

1402
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:07.40
It's a negative because all it does is make people defensive.

1403
01:56:07.40 --> 01:56:08.36
Now listen,

1404
01:56:08.36 --> 01:56:12.72
it doesn't mean that you're sitting back

1405
01:56:12.72 --> 01:56:17.16
in your shirking and shriveling up, no.

1406
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:19.92
But it means that you're finding the balance

1407
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:22.16
with another person and you're,

1408
01:56:22.16 --> 01:56:25.96
you're working with them and conversing with them

1409
01:56:25.96 --> 01:56:29.60
to bring them along into your way of thinking.

1410
01:56:29.60 --> 01:56:30.60
Yeah.

1411
01:56:30.60 --> 01:56:32.84
That's what it is.

1412
01:56:32.84 --> 01:56:37.84
And you know, when somebody asks me a question like this,

1413
01:56:39.32 --> 01:56:43.84
it really signifies to me that,

1414
01:56:45.16 --> 01:56:48.84
it makes me nervous because I think to myself,

1415
01:56:48.84 --> 01:56:50.48
I say this all the time.

1416
01:56:50.48 --> 01:56:52.36
I mean, I say use the indirect approach,

1417
01:56:52.36 --> 01:56:54.48
don't, you know, get people's defenses up.

1418
01:56:54.48 --> 01:56:55.64
I say this all the time.

1419
01:56:55.64 --> 01:56:58.56
And yet someone can still come back and say,

1420
01:56:58.56 --> 01:57:01.64
you know, people are telling me I'm being too aggressive.

1421
01:57:01.64 --> 01:57:03.76
Like they're not even taking ownership of the fact

1422
01:57:03.76 --> 01:57:05.52
that they're being too aggressive, right?

1423
01:57:05.52 --> 01:57:08.64
It's like the other people are weak.

1424
01:57:08.64 --> 01:57:11.000
And therefore, since they're weak,

1425
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.24
they think I'm too aggressive.

1426
01:57:12.24 --> 01:57:14.64
I can't believe how pathetic they are.

1427
01:57:14.64 --> 01:57:15.48
Yeah.

1428
01:57:15.48 --> 01:57:16.32
That's the reality.

1429
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:18.20
That's what's going through someone like this mind.

1430
01:57:18.20 --> 01:57:22.68
Like sometimes it's called working on your how.

1431
01:57:22.68 --> 01:57:24.04
You know, he's kind of saying,

1432
01:57:24.04 --> 01:57:26.40
oh, they've got a euphemism for it.

1433
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:29.000
And in the business world,

1434
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.52
there's a big push on diversity,

1435
01:57:30.52 --> 01:57:33.48
but it comes with diversifying away from intensity

1436
01:57:33.48 --> 01:57:35.92
and male aggression.

1437
01:57:35.92 --> 01:57:40.96
I mean, you can guarantee what this guy thought I was going to say.

1438
01:57:40.96 --> 01:57:43.28
Like, no, you've got to just stay the path.

1439
01:57:43.28 --> 01:57:44.84
You've got to, if people can't take it,

1440
01:57:44.84 --> 01:57:46.04
you've got to crush them.

1441
01:57:46.04 --> 01:57:48.28
No, actually, that's a complete wrong answer.

1442
01:57:48.28 --> 01:57:49.12
Yeah.

1443
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:53.88
If people can't take it, it's because you are being too aggressive.

1444
01:57:53.88 --> 01:57:55.32
Yeah, the way you're giving it is wrong.

1445
01:57:55.32 --> 01:57:56.76
The way you're giving it is wrong.

1446
01:57:56.76 --> 01:57:57.88
The way you're giving it is wrong.

1447
01:57:57.88 --> 01:58:01.32
So that aggression needs to be channeled

1448
01:58:01.32 --> 01:58:03.48
in such a way that it's being utilized

1449
01:58:03.48 --> 01:58:07.60
to further the goal, to further the goal.

1450
01:58:07.60 --> 01:58:11.84
And you know who you get aggressive with yourself.

1451
01:58:13.16 --> 01:58:15.88
You get aggressive with yourself.

1452
01:58:15.88 --> 01:58:17.48
That's who I get aggressive with.

1453
01:58:17.48 --> 01:58:19.40
You don't want to be straightforward with.

1454
01:58:19.40 --> 01:58:21.72
I'm straightforward with myself.

1455
01:58:21.72 --> 01:58:23.88
That's who I'm straightforward with.

1456
01:58:23.88 --> 01:58:28.16
I'm the one guy that I'm allowed to get aggressive with,

1457
01:58:28.16 --> 01:58:31.32
to be straightforward with, to put things in,

1458
01:58:31.32 --> 01:58:33.84
to not sugarcoat anything.

1459
01:58:33.84 --> 01:58:36.12
I'm allowed to do that with me.

1460
01:58:37.60 --> 01:58:40.20
But I'm not allowed to do it with another human

1461
01:58:40.20 --> 01:58:43.72
because it's not an effective way of leadership.

1462
01:58:43.72 --> 01:58:45.12
It just is not.

1463
01:58:48.80 --> 01:58:50.80
Yeah, it's funny.

1464
01:58:50.80 --> 01:58:52.000
It's funny, I like.

1465
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.96
That's absolutely true.

1466
01:58:53.96 --> 01:58:56.24
And with you what I said is absolutely true.

1467
01:58:56.24 --> 01:59:01.96
I don't think I've ever seen you get mad at someone else.

1468
01:59:01.96 --> 01:59:05.68
But at the same time, and I pick a lot of people

1469
01:59:05.68 --> 01:59:10.20
who may not know you good, but have experience being around you.

1470
01:59:10.20 --> 01:59:12.84
They all feel, I would say that they all feel the same way.

1471
01:59:12.84 --> 01:59:16.52
And that is that, yeah, I fucking juggle school or whatever.

1472
01:59:16.52 --> 01:59:19.80
But if he were to like lose his temper on me,

1473
01:59:19.80 --> 01:59:22.16
he probably died.

1474
01:59:22.16 --> 01:59:24.000
Yeah, good.

1475
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.12
Good.

1476
01:59:26.12 --> 01:59:27.36
And they're right.

1477
01:59:27.36 --> 01:59:29.76
Like I'm glad I'm not losing my temper on school.

1478
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:32.24
Yeah, that will be good at all.

1479
01:59:32.24 --> 01:59:33.16
That'd be bad.

1480
01:59:33.16 --> 01:59:36.96
I have, you know, that would not be good for people.

1481
01:59:36.96 --> 01:59:38.72
Oh, no, I don't think so.

1482
01:59:41.36 --> 01:59:42.96
That's that they caught me though.

1483
01:59:42.96 --> 01:59:47.40
That is that sense of safety, yet the sense of impending doom

1484
01:59:47.40 --> 01:59:48.92
is there at the same time.

1485
01:59:48.92 --> 01:59:49.92
Yeah.

1486
01:59:51.92 --> 01:59:56.08
Yeah, and, and, and I think it, I think it does genuinely

1487
01:59:56.08 --> 01:59:57.56
surprise people.

1488
01:59:57.56 --> 02:00:02.16
Yeah, because I look like a serial killer.

1489
02:00:02.16 --> 02:00:04.04
I'm a big guy, whatever.

1490
02:00:04.04 --> 02:00:09.60
And they expect that that I'm going to be aggressive

1491
02:00:09.60 --> 02:00:10.92
and implementing this.

1492
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:13.84
And you know, you've got to get your shit together.

1493
02:00:13.84 --> 02:00:14.68
Right?

1494
02:00:14.68 --> 02:00:17.24
But it's just not, it's just an effective way of leadership.

1495
02:00:17.24 --> 02:00:20.32
If that was, if that was leadership, leadership would be easy.

1496
02:00:20.32 --> 02:00:21.32
It would be easy, right?

1497
02:00:21.32 --> 02:00:22.32
I'm just going to yell at everyone.

1498
02:00:22.32 --> 02:00:24.32
They're going to do what I say.

1499
02:00:24.32 --> 02:00:27.68
You know, I'm just going to yell at everyone and then they'll do what

1500
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:28.68
I say.

1501
02:00:28.68 --> 02:00:30.20
That just does not work.

1502
02:00:30.20 --> 02:00:32.96
Yeah, it's crazy though, because just the way you talk a lot of

1503
02:00:32.96 --> 02:00:33.96
the times, not all the time.

1504
02:00:33.96 --> 02:00:36.52
But just the way, maybe it's like just how you saw it.

1505
02:00:36.52 --> 02:00:37.52
I don't know.

1506
02:00:37.52 --> 02:00:38.52
Your voice, I don't know.

1507
02:00:38.52 --> 02:00:41.56
It's probably everything really is you do sound intense, even though

1508
02:00:41.56 --> 02:00:44.72
you're not being intense, you know, you just kind of seem that way.

1509
02:00:44.72 --> 02:00:46.12
For all these reasons, of course.

1510
02:00:46.12 --> 02:00:49.32
So it's like you said earlier, when I'm talking about something that I

1511
02:00:49.32 --> 02:00:54.12
care about, yes, I am definitely going to be intense about it, especially

1512
02:00:54.12 --> 02:00:56.28
when it's something that is impactful to me.

1513
02:00:56.28 --> 02:00:57.28
Yeah.

1514
02:00:57.28 --> 02:01:01.24
And something that means something to me and to me, leadership does mean a lot

1515
02:01:01.24 --> 02:01:02.24
to me.

1516
02:01:02.24 --> 02:01:08.20
And trying to help people lead is an important thing to me.

1517
02:01:08.20 --> 02:01:09.32
I enjoy it.

1518
02:01:09.32 --> 02:01:10.76
And I like to see people succeed.

1519
02:01:10.76 --> 02:01:15.04
So therefore when I talk about it, sometimes I get a little bit fired up.

1520
02:01:15.04 --> 02:01:17.48
And I get intense with what I'm saying.

1521
02:01:17.48 --> 02:01:19.16
That isn't scary.

1522
02:01:19.16 --> 02:01:21.76
That just kind of, it's like indirectly scary.

1523
02:01:21.76 --> 02:01:23.48
So it's not, let me scare you.

1524
02:01:23.48 --> 02:01:25.20
OK, I'll just use word, scary.

1525
02:01:25.20 --> 02:01:26.28
It's indirectly scary.

1526
02:01:26.28 --> 02:01:28.72
When you do it, it's like, oh, I'm not scared of what you're doing.

1527
02:01:28.72 --> 02:01:30.20
But you kind of can imagine.

1528
02:01:30.20 --> 02:01:31.36
And you're like, all right.

1529
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:34.24
What if, you know, you're kind of like, you're

1530
02:01:34.24 --> 02:01:37.64
like this raging hurricane that when it comes by, it turns into

1531
02:01:37.64 --> 02:01:40.04
like a warm gentle breeze.

1532
02:01:40.04 --> 02:01:40.64
You know what I mean?

1533
02:01:40.64 --> 02:01:43.40
You kind of like.

1534
02:01:43.40 --> 02:01:46.76
And maybe that's probably part of the advantage.

1535
02:01:46.76 --> 02:01:47.20
Yeah.

1536
02:01:47.20 --> 02:01:49.84
Part of the advantage is people, you know, I said this.

1537
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:50.76
I think it was Tim Ferriss.

1538
02:01:50.76 --> 02:01:56.08
I said this to, you know, people are surprised when I can sit there

1539
02:01:56.08 --> 02:01:57.88
and have a conversation with them.

1540
02:01:57.88 --> 02:02:00.48
And I'm not aggressive with them.

1541
02:02:00.48 --> 02:02:04.40
And my mind is open to what they're saying.

1542
02:02:04.40 --> 02:02:05.40
Yeah.

1543
02:02:05.40 --> 02:02:07.40
That's part of the game.

1544
02:02:07.40 --> 02:02:08.40
Yeah.

1545
02:02:08.40 --> 02:02:11.40
All right.

1546
02:02:11.40 --> 02:02:13.40
Next question.

1547
02:02:13.40 --> 02:02:17.40
Okay, juggle.

1548
02:02:17.40 --> 02:02:20.40
You're reaction to Marsoc, right?

1549
02:02:20.40 --> 02:02:21.40
Marsoc.

1550
02:02:21.40 --> 02:02:22.40
Marsoc.

1551
02:02:22.40 --> 02:02:23.40
M.R.

1552
02:02:23.40 --> 02:02:25.40
S.O.C.

1553
02:02:25.40 --> 02:02:28.40
Performing Marine Corps Special Operations Command.

1554
02:02:28.40 --> 02:02:29.40
Yeah.

1555
02:02:29.40 --> 02:02:32.40
So that's a new thing.

1556
02:02:32.40 --> 02:02:35.40
So, and this is the question that he's asking.

1557
02:02:35.40 --> 02:02:38.84
Well, Marines think there's seals now.

1558
02:02:38.84 --> 02:02:46.64
Or yeah, we should have been Marines all along.

1559
02:02:46.64 --> 02:02:51.04
So this is a question about, like I said, the Marine Corps Special Operations Command.

1560
02:02:51.04 --> 02:02:59.84
It was formed in, I don't know, 2005, 2006 maybe.

1561
02:02:59.84 --> 02:03:05.36
And if you don't know, the Army has its own Special Operations Group.

1562
02:03:05.36 --> 02:03:08.80
The Navy has its own Special Operations Group.

1563
02:03:08.80 --> 02:03:11.60
The Air Force has its own Special Operations Group.

1564
02:03:11.60 --> 02:03:13.40
And the Marine Corps did not.

1565
02:03:13.40 --> 02:03:14.40
What is Force Recon?

1566
02:03:14.40 --> 02:03:15.40
Have you ever heard of it?

1567
02:03:15.40 --> 02:03:16.40
Yeah.

1568
02:03:16.40 --> 02:03:20.92
Force Recon was a part of the Marine Corps, but it wasn't broken off.

1569
02:03:20.92 --> 02:03:24.48
And it didn't get the extra money and the extra funding and it didn't fall into the chain

1570
02:03:24.48 --> 02:03:29.40
of command of Special Operations.

1571
02:03:29.40 --> 02:03:31.96
And so when they made Marsoc, it did.

1572
02:03:31.96 --> 02:03:38.08
So now they took a bunch of Force Recon guys and put them into a group and have their

1573
02:03:38.08 --> 02:03:39.20
own funding and everything else.

1574
02:03:39.20 --> 02:03:46.28
So the bottom line is on this is that the Marine Corps is awesome.

1575
02:03:46.28 --> 02:03:47.72
And I love the Marine Corps.

1576
02:03:47.72 --> 02:03:50.08
And I think that this was long overdue.

1577
02:03:50.08 --> 02:04:01.92
I think that the Marine Corps as a whole is likely the most key thing to do is to

1578
02:04:01.92 --> 02:04:04.36
make a bowl fighting unit.

1579
02:04:04.36 --> 02:04:06.40
The world is ever known to be honest with you.

1580
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:13.56
I mean, maybe the in addition the airborne divisions from the Army are also just highly

1581
02:04:13.56 --> 02:04:15.44
capable.

1582
02:04:15.44 --> 02:04:21.16
But the Marine Corps with its air ground sea, it's got command and control, it's got integrated

1583
02:04:21.16 --> 02:04:23.40
intelligence, it's got everything.

1584
02:04:23.40 --> 02:04:24.84
And it can use it all together.

1585
02:04:24.84 --> 02:04:33.60
And so that makes it just an extremely effective and efficient fighting force.

1586
02:04:33.60 --> 02:04:36.52
And they are highly disciplined, they are highly motivated.

1587
02:04:36.52 --> 02:04:38.96
There's an incredible aspreet of corps.

1588
02:04:38.96 --> 02:04:44.08
So for me, this was long overdue.

1589
02:04:44.08 --> 02:04:54.80
And I think that I actually did a turnover with the initial kind of Marsoc group in 2004.

1590
02:04:54.80 --> 02:04:56.56
And back that.

1591
02:04:56.56 --> 02:05:00.68
And I'd work with the Marine Corps on I had more work with force recon on multiple deployments

1592
02:05:00.68 --> 02:05:03.12
when I was a younger seal.

1593
02:05:03.12 --> 02:05:09.08
And they took a bunch of those guys a bunch of just legendary force recon guys and put them

1594
02:05:09.08 --> 02:05:12.96
into this first Marsoc company.

1595
02:05:12.96 --> 02:05:14.56
And they were awesome.

1596
02:05:14.56 --> 02:05:17.76
Awesome warriors, awesome guys.

1597
02:05:17.76 --> 02:05:22.76
And I think I actually have one thing that that's a huge benefit to them is in the Marine

1598
02:05:22.76 --> 02:05:24.80
Corps, you're in the Marine Corps.

1599
02:05:24.80 --> 02:05:27.44
So every Marine Corps, every Marine is a rifleman.

1600
02:05:27.44 --> 02:05:33.32
They have the opportunity to work with big conventional infantry companies and platoons

1601
02:05:33.32 --> 02:05:34.32
and battalion.

1602
02:05:34.32 --> 02:05:38.20
So their guys will be very experienced.

1603
02:05:38.20 --> 02:05:43.60
And I think that they are going to be, I mean, I think that the Marine Corps special

1604
02:05:43.60 --> 02:05:50.40
operations command is going to be an extremely capable force in the future.

1605
02:05:50.40 --> 02:06:02.44
And I am glad to say the least that they will be defending our country and freedom around

1606
02:06:02.44 --> 02:06:06.08
the world for many, many years to come.

1607
02:06:06.08 --> 02:06:11.76
Yeah, that kind of goes along with what you were saying, or a lot of these points that

1608
02:06:11.76 --> 02:06:15.48
these books make about how the discipline and the training are so paramount.

1609
02:06:15.48 --> 02:06:20.36
You know, in success, now you have yet another division that's going to get some solid

1610
02:06:20.36 --> 02:06:22.36
training, you know, yeah, for sure.

1611
02:06:22.36 --> 02:06:25.92
There's no doubt the Marine Corps will put these guys through outstanding training.

1612
02:06:25.92 --> 02:06:26.92
Yeah.

1613
02:06:26.92 --> 02:06:37.24
Next question, do you consider shooting a martial art and how is your firearms training

1614
02:06:37.24 --> 02:06:40.08
been like or unlike martial arts training?

1615
02:06:40.08 --> 02:06:47.56
Well, shooting is absolutely a martial art.

1616
02:06:47.56 --> 02:06:52.52
I mean, maybe not the way people picture martial arts nowadays, because when you picture

1617
02:06:52.52 --> 02:06:57.40
martial art, people picture, you know, a guy with a guy doing karate.

1618
02:06:57.40 --> 02:06:58.40
That's right.

1619
02:06:58.40 --> 02:06:59.40
That's the generic picture.

1620
02:06:59.40 --> 02:07:02.24
To me, that's not martial arts, actually.

1621
02:07:02.24 --> 02:07:05.96
To me, martial arts is the art of war.

1622
02:07:05.96 --> 02:07:11.48
The individual warrior skills that it takes.

1623
02:07:11.48 --> 02:07:16.24
And firearms are absolutely a martial art because it's something that you train.

1624
02:07:16.24 --> 02:07:17.96
It's something that you get good at.

1625
02:07:17.96 --> 02:07:22.16
It's something that you need to maintain your skill at.

1626
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:25.48
And it is absolutely a martial art.

1627
02:07:25.48 --> 02:07:32.48
And to me, it's another piece of the puzzle.

1628
02:07:32.48 --> 02:07:36.04
It's another thing that you shouldn't, you need to know how to do.

1629
02:07:36.04 --> 02:07:43.20
And just like tactics that go along with shooting are an important part of being a warrior,

1630
02:07:43.20 --> 02:07:44.48
you need to not shoot.

1631
02:07:44.48 --> 02:07:51.88
The training is very similar in my mind to martial arts training.

1632
02:07:51.88 --> 02:07:56.64
In that it takes, you know, repetition, you have to know what the basics are.

1633
02:07:56.64 --> 02:07:58.20
You have to repeat those basics.

1634
02:07:58.20 --> 02:08:01.20
And then you get more advanced.

1635
02:08:01.20 --> 02:08:10.52
And it's about movement and getting efficient with your movement.

1636
02:08:10.52 --> 02:08:16.20
And then you want to train it very similar to the way that you train mixed martial arts

1637
02:08:16.20 --> 02:08:17.56
or martial arts in general.

1638
02:08:17.56 --> 02:08:20.48
And that is, you're going to have different threat levels and how you're going to deal with

1639
02:08:20.48 --> 02:08:21.48
them.

1640
02:08:21.48 --> 02:08:22.68
And you want to deal with your weak side.

1641
02:08:22.68 --> 02:08:28.28
You know, you can shoot with your offhand in various environments in the low light, in

1642
02:08:28.28 --> 02:08:32.28
the dark, in the rain, and you want to mix it up.

1643
02:08:32.28 --> 02:08:33.28
So you're used to all of it.

1644
02:08:33.28 --> 02:08:35.44
You want to be used to people at close range.

1645
02:08:35.44 --> 02:08:39.16
You want to be used to people at further range.

1646
02:08:39.16 --> 02:08:46.16
And then once you get all those mechanical skills down, then you want to train your mind

1647
02:08:46.16 --> 02:08:47.72
around this thing.

1648
02:08:47.72 --> 02:08:55.96
You want to train your mind around this skill so that your mind knows how to utilize this

1649
02:08:55.96 --> 02:08:58.28
skill when things are unexpected.

1650
02:08:58.28 --> 02:09:02.20
And when there's chaos and when there's mayhem going on.

1651
02:09:02.20 --> 02:09:07.44
And that's one of the things that I really like about the simulation training or paint

1652
02:09:07.44 --> 02:09:16.16
ball training or laser tag training is it allows you to have somebody else shoot back

1653
02:09:16.16 --> 02:09:22.92
it to you, which is just like just like rolling in GJT or sparring more Thai or sparring

1654
02:09:22.92 --> 02:09:27.40
MMA is you have to react to the person it's no longer just a cata.

1655
02:09:27.40 --> 02:09:34.80
It's no longer just shooting paper targets that don't shoot back and don't move.

1656
02:09:34.80 --> 02:09:40.52
So I love to take it once you've got the skills down and then you learn you've got the

1657
02:09:40.52 --> 02:09:47.16
fundamentals down and then you take the advanced fundamentals and then you begin to train

1658
02:09:47.16 --> 02:09:49.56
to simulate combat.

1659
02:09:49.56 --> 02:09:58.40
And this is I'll tell you, I have these laser tag guns for my son.

1660
02:09:58.40 --> 02:10:03.28
And I just got two of them at first but that escalated very quickly because they were

1661
02:10:03.28 --> 02:10:04.28
awesome.

1662
02:10:04.28 --> 02:10:10.28
There are these little nerf laser tag guns and you could shoot each other at I don't

1663
02:10:10.28 --> 02:10:17.20
know maybe a hundred meters which is a pretty good shot as like a pistol.

1664
02:10:17.20 --> 02:10:21.72
And so when I got these and it seems I got two of them and I realized how good they

1665
02:10:21.72 --> 02:10:22.72
were.

1666
02:10:22.72 --> 02:10:25.60
I bought two more so I could go against my son and his friends and they could go against

1667
02:10:25.60 --> 02:10:30.36
each other and I taught my son like all the basic military maneuvers that he would

1668
02:10:30.36 --> 02:10:31.36
need to know.

1669
02:10:31.36 --> 02:10:39.000
And this is when he was maybe eight years old and we would play this game all the time

1670
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.24
you know.

1671
02:10:40.24 --> 02:10:42.12
And so I taught him out of cover and move.

1672
02:10:42.12 --> 02:10:43.72
I taught him how to get elevated positions.

1673
02:10:43.72 --> 02:10:48.92
I taught him how to do individual movement techniques where you don't show your face at

1674
02:10:48.92 --> 02:10:54.16
the same spot like twice and row every time you get up you move a little bit.

1675
02:10:54.16 --> 02:10:58.80
And he realized that that's how you win in these little games and they're real those

1676
02:10:58.80 --> 02:11:00.76
are the real tactics.

1677
02:11:00.76 --> 02:11:05.64
And so I had a speaking of speaking of the Marine Corps.

1678
02:11:05.64 --> 02:11:19.48
I had a friend that was came over to the house one time and he was you know a Marine and

1679
02:11:19.48 --> 02:11:22.68
we got in the conversation and all of a sudden you know my son comes out with the laser

1680
02:11:22.68 --> 02:11:28.92
tag guns and my son's like oh you know do you want to go and the guys like you know

1681
02:11:28.92 --> 02:11:31.52
yeah of course let's do it.

1682
02:11:31.52 --> 02:11:36.84
So my son looks at him and says indoor or outdoor and he all of a sudden you could see

1683
02:11:36.84 --> 02:11:40.80
there was something going on and the guy goes out to or outdoor.

1684
02:11:40.80 --> 02:11:45.24
So my son you you press the button on the thing and it counts down for 10 seconds and

1685
02:11:45.24 --> 02:11:46.24
then it's on.

1686
02:11:46.24 --> 02:11:48.72
So wait so you go fight and cover or something like that.

1687
02:11:48.72 --> 02:11:53.28
So yeah so 10 seconds my son hits the thing my son takes off out the door.

1688
02:11:53.28 --> 02:11:58.12
So I'm watching a guy and I got this guy's doomed because you know you're going against

1689
02:11:58.12 --> 02:12:01.20
a train shooting the killer.

1690
02:12:01.20 --> 02:12:06.80
So the guy comes out and and it's dark right but the guy comes out of the door and

1691
02:12:06.80 --> 02:12:10.12
I'm watching me he's kind of grouched a little bit and all of a sudden his gun because

1692
02:12:10.12 --> 02:12:14.32
it all is in this one system it's all takes place inside the gun you don't wear

1693
02:12:14.32 --> 02:12:17.60
a helmet you don't wear anything you actually are shooting the other person's gun.

1694
02:12:17.60 --> 02:12:23.80
I want to shot when you when you get shot it goes and shakes and the red light flashes.

1695
02:12:23.80 --> 02:12:29.28
So he walks out and sure enough my son had run around the block gotten into that related

1696
02:12:29.28 --> 02:12:34.52
position and as soon as he came walking out my son sort of drilling him and the guy's like

1697
02:12:34.52 --> 02:12:38.60
he freezes it's interesting like he freezes he doesn't even think to myself oh I'll

1698
02:12:38.60 --> 02:12:44.08
take cover no he just froze and got drilled and then as soon as it's he stand there he's

1699
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:48.16
kind of looking around looking around looking around finally he sees my son he starts

1700
02:12:48.16 --> 02:12:53.76
to point the weapon up towards my son my son just disappears and then the guys

1701
02:12:53.76 --> 02:12:59.16
start to kind of walking over in that direction and then 15 seconds later my son pops

1702
02:12:59.16 --> 02:13:03.32
up on his flank and drills him again from behind another fence and the whole the wall

1703
02:13:03.32 --> 02:13:07.84
and anyways he ends up killing him and then the guys okay let's go again and my son

1704
02:13:07.84 --> 02:13:14.20
beat him like three times in a row and it's because he had the basic the basic skills

1705
02:13:14.20 --> 02:13:19.84
basic infantryman skills is what it was you know he would shoot and then move and

1706
02:13:19.84 --> 02:13:26.64
that's what it boils down to so that kind of thing is is very important in as

1707
02:13:26.64 --> 02:13:32.72
far as being a martial art and you should train you know that's another thing

1708
02:13:32.72 --> 02:13:37.76
you know I said this to Sam Harris when I was on his podcast you know yeah

1709
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:43.04
maybe there's a no chance because you live in a in the bubble and you live in a

1710
02:13:43.04 --> 02:13:45.92
great neighborhood and you're well protecting you have a long system your

1711
02:13:45.92 --> 02:13:50.36
house and all that and maybe you're never gonna have a problem and that's great

1712
02:13:50.36 --> 02:13:53.88
I mean there's always a chance I would never believe that you're never gonna have

1713
02:13:53.88 --> 02:13:57.32
a problem but there's always a chance that somebody's gonna confront you that's

1714
02:13:57.32 --> 02:14:02.84
evil is gonna enter your world and you want to be ready for that now if that

1715
02:14:02.84 --> 02:14:08.68
makes me sound paranoid okay let's just say you're not paranoid and you don't

1716
02:14:08.68 --> 02:14:15.20
think it's ever gonna happen but it is still highly valuable to train in these

1717
02:14:15.20 --> 02:14:19.56
situations because they make you a better person they make you sharper they

1718
02:14:19.56 --> 02:14:24.92
make you smarter they make you more prepared if something does happen it's just

1719
02:14:24.92 --> 02:14:29.32
good to know this stuff and it makes you a better person more reliable it's a real

1720
02:14:29.32 --> 02:14:36.68
skill set you know I was was kind of bummed out about basketball or football or

1721
02:14:36.68 --> 02:14:40.96
baseball because those are the there are life skills involved in my not

1722
02:14:40.96 --> 02:14:46.20
saying that but the skill itself of throwing the baseball of shooting a

1723
02:14:46.20 --> 02:14:53.76
basketball of throwing a football is not as valuable as a skill as number one

1724
02:14:53.76 --> 02:15:00.48
a martial artist you know moly tie boxing wrestling GJ2 because those are real

1725
02:15:00.48 --> 02:15:07.92
applicable to life 100% and this is the same thing with shooting a gut I mean

1726
02:15:07.92 --> 02:15:11.88
that is a real applicable skill that you may need at some point in your life and

1727
02:15:11.88 --> 02:15:22.20
you should have it you know what supplements do you and echo take what supplements

1728
02:15:22.20 --> 02:15:27.28
do you take well my number one supplement is steak

1729
02:15:27.28 --> 02:15:36.32
steak yes beautiful steak that's the number one well there there are a couple

1730
02:15:36.32 --> 02:15:41.000
things that I take number one I take krill oil I've taken it every day for

1731
02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:49.20
probably ten years maybe a little bit longer and I take glucose

1732
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:57.52
mean and I've taken that every day for ten plus years I got I had when my

1733
02:15:57.52 --> 02:16:03.20
shoulder was bothering me many years ago and someone said hey take krill oil

1734
02:16:03.20 --> 02:16:08.56
take glucose mean and I said actually know what it wasn't krill oil it was

1735
02:16:08.56 --> 02:16:13.44
official all the time but at the same time I just started taking both and within a

1736
02:16:13.44 --> 02:16:17.16
short period of time my shoulder got better and it had been a nagging nine

1737
02:16:17.16 --> 02:16:22.40
month injury so I don't know which one of those two did it but I'm never gonna

1738
02:16:22.40 --> 02:16:29.48
find out if someone was gonna take them both yeah you know I eat a lot of

1739
02:16:29.48 --> 02:16:34.52
coconut oil whenever I get the chance I like dipping things in coconut oil

1740
02:16:34.52 --> 02:16:39.76
coconut oil is if you get a taste for it it's a really nice tasting thing yeah

1741
02:16:39.76 --> 02:16:46.36
yeah so that's that's the supplements that I take you know one thing that's been

1742
02:16:46.36 --> 02:16:52.72
really cool is is picking up a sponsorship from on it for the podcast you

1743
02:16:52.72 --> 02:16:59.000
know from Joe who's obviously been a big supporter he's actually the reason

1744
02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.12
that we're sitting here right now because Joe Rogan I mean Tim Ferriss had the

1745
02:17:02.12 --> 02:17:05.72
same thing with Joe Rogan said you need to have your own podcast and I said okay

1746
02:17:05.72 --> 02:17:12.48
here we are and he was you know real supportive so I definitely like

1747
02:17:12.48 --> 02:17:19.52
supporting him his company with on it but what's great is they make good quality

1748
02:17:19.52 --> 02:17:26.56
stuff and it's real simple yeah it's funny and I didn't really tell you about this

1749
02:17:26.56 --> 02:17:33.32
but if you go on on the on it on it on it website you can get stuck on there

1750
02:17:33.32 --> 02:17:37.16
for a long time just reading all the stuff about it you know like that the

1751
02:17:37.16 --> 02:17:41.72
krill oil was one and I know about krill oil from long time and they're

1752
02:17:41.72 --> 02:17:45.20
krill or like these little they're like little shrimp basically teeny

1753
02:17:45.20 --> 02:17:50.40
tanger you know so teeny tiny shrimp yeah for lack of that away putting it but

1754
02:17:50.40 --> 02:17:54.32
how they get it is like it's all eco friendly where it doesn't destroy the or

1755
02:17:54.32 --> 02:17:59.36
affect the ecosystem even the big ship the vessel that they used to to

1756
02:17:59.36 --> 02:18:04.68
to harvest the the krill is like low emissions specifically certified like

1757
02:18:04.68 --> 02:18:08.12
dang it's real in-depthing you get stuck on this real interesting too because

1758
02:18:08.12 --> 02:18:11.04
they tell you like what are the benefits you know how do they know that these

1759
02:18:11.04 --> 02:18:15.80
benefits are there because you can't just say hey take this little cure this you

1760
02:18:15.80 --> 02:18:20.68
can't just do that you got to go through this process yeah to be honest over

1761
02:18:20.68 --> 02:18:24.28
the krill oil I don't know maybe like seven years ago or something at some point

1762
02:18:24.28 --> 02:18:28.92
I went from fish oil to krill oil yeah apparently they're fun and it's like

1763
02:18:28.92 --> 02:18:32.72
little bit better some I think it's a lot better yeah wouldn't well at least

1764
02:18:32.72 --> 02:18:38.72
when you read about it but to me people ask me you know oh what do you do you

1765
02:18:38.72 --> 02:18:45.16
know because I'm 44 years old old man right but I don't feel 44 yeah I feel

1766
02:18:45.16 --> 02:18:50.16
24 you don't feel 44 yeah I feel I feel 24 and actually

1767
02:18:50.16 --> 02:18:55.28
the thing that originally turned me on to fish oil was there was a guy that

1768
02:18:55.28 --> 02:19:05.76
was a badass guy and he was 54 but he was a competitive power lifter when

1769
02:19:05.76 --> 02:19:10.12
he was younger and he was in really good shape and this is probably when I was

1770
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:13.72
what was I at that that's 15 years ago or something like that I was like 30

1771
02:19:13.72 --> 02:19:19.48
years old and this guy looked young and healthy and I said you know hey well

1772
02:19:19.48 --> 02:19:23.56
what do you do like what your main thing to keep you so young and healthy and

1773
02:19:23.56 --> 02:19:30.32
he said I take fish oil every day okay cool let's try that yeah I will get on

1774
02:19:30.32 --> 02:19:37.60
board that train yeah so yeah to be honest for some today and no no

1775
02:19:37.60 --> 02:19:41.56
krill oil we'll get you some krill right on thank you yeah and you get

1776
02:19:41.56 --> 02:19:49.16
krill oil at on a dot com yeah the on a back slash jacco that's right forward

1777
02:19:49.16 --> 02:19:52.92
slash anything I don't know what it is forward slash jacco actually I put it

1778
02:19:52.92 --> 02:19:56.68
on the on the website on both websites the jacco store website and the

1779
02:19:56.68 --> 02:20:03.52
jacco podcast website so sweet yeah and oh and they give us a discount so or so

1780
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:09.04
on it is giving our listeners a discount like 10% my people and what I did

1781
02:20:09.04 --> 02:20:12.96
find out on it regardless of whatever discount you get they you have free

1782
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:18.08
shipping on everything except I want to say that the big oh I don't know

1783
02:20:18.08 --> 02:20:21.20
it's done cattle bells yeah but everything else like something you get free

1784
02:20:21.20 --> 02:20:24.88
shipping also which is kind of seems like a small deal and doing the

1785
02:20:24.88 --> 02:20:29.20
cuz I've sold things online and stuff before like insurance and that's

1786
02:20:29.20 --> 02:20:33.76
the none of the stuff is here and of course I bought things online but and

1787
02:20:33.76 --> 02:20:37.52
when you see that free shipping oh no it's just something it seems small real

1788
02:20:37.52 --> 02:20:40.80
like legit yeah you you kind of feel it you know what I mean

1789
02:20:40.80 --> 02:20:45.20
people probably want to know what supplements you take people mainly

1790
02:20:45.20 --> 02:20:48.24
would ask me that in college it's when everyone wants to hear what's

1791
02:20:48.24 --> 02:20:51.60
something because they think for some reason that supplements give you big

1792
02:20:51.60 --> 02:20:54.96
muscles or something they don't they don't think about that whole working out

1793
02:20:54.96 --> 02:20:59.36
yeah the whole working out thing I mean yeah that was secondary

1794
02:21:00.40 --> 02:21:05.52
but yeah and then in jacco they care less about muscles there they'll be like

1795
02:21:05.52 --> 02:21:09.28
you know it's actually you get kind of tease sometimes in jacco if you have big

1796
02:21:09.28 --> 02:21:14.40
muscles it's weird you don't get teased but you lose credit for your skills

1797
02:21:14.40 --> 02:21:17.76
yes on your side yeah that too but you kind of do get

1798
02:21:17.76 --> 02:21:23.44
every person ever roll with you know you get done rolling they're like man you're strong

1799
02:21:23.44 --> 02:21:30.40
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're weak I've been training for 20 years too by the way

1800
02:21:30.40 --> 02:21:37.44
yeah that's nothing to do with us yeah I take the only supplement I take

1801
02:21:38.72 --> 02:21:45.60
alpha brain the instant one oh the instant alpha and I do take a pre workout which is

1802
02:21:45.60 --> 02:21:50.32
I mean I'm gonna be honest I don't know if I should take a pre workout pre workout is just

1803
02:21:50.32 --> 02:21:52.96
you know what that is right you just like a little powder it's like is a

1804
02:21:52.96 --> 02:22:01.44
stimulant it's caffeine in it typically in n02 nitric nitric oxide it basically makes

1805
02:22:01.44 --> 02:22:05.60
your it basil dilate to you so your vessels get dilated so it

1806
02:22:05.60 --> 02:22:09.92
you get more of a pompe gives you energy it's just like it's basically stimulant

1807
02:22:09.92 --> 02:22:14.80
energy so you know if you're not in the mood for working out but I found this little

1808
02:22:14.80 --> 02:22:20.32
sweet sweet little combo you put alpha brain instant with it or just with coffee

1809
02:22:20.32 --> 02:22:24.64
drink some coffee in the alpha brain instant it hits you at the same time but

1810
02:22:24.64 --> 02:22:32.24
if you didn't want to work out you'll want to work out with that check but yeah so yeah

1811
02:22:32.24 --> 02:22:36.64
that's it that's pretty much it it's funny because a lot of people they think that if you

1812
02:22:36.64 --> 02:22:40.16
take protein powder it'll make your muscles big like it'll help you get big muscles

1813
02:22:40.16 --> 02:22:49.12
but no like if you take your favorite supplement which is steak just eat normal you know

1814
02:22:49.12 --> 02:22:52.64
and if you're working out you're gonna eat a little bit more that's how you get big

1815
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:57.20
muscles work out good and have the correct workout for muscles which is different kind of

1816
02:22:57.20 --> 02:23:01.68
work out then if you want to you know get conditioning or something like that and then eat it

1817
02:23:01.68 --> 02:23:06.24
enough that's what you got to do and eat right after you work out I mean you got to do that too I think

1818
02:23:06.24 --> 02:23:13.20
no actually I think I don't you go and somebody actually somebody put on Twitter that

1819
02:23:13.20 --> 02:23:20.64
I was right there's like some about you're not testosterone release or HGH there's some kind of

1820
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.24
something happening your system will research that one yeah yeah I don't want to have an

1821
02:23:26.24 --> 02:23:33.68
uneducated argument right now yeah at all so you're looking at them call it bro science

1822
02:23:33.68 --> 02:23:40.000
yeah exactly I'm going down the bro science road right now that would be wrong but yes to answer

1823
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.16
the question supplements that's like in every day supplement too I'll bring it by the way

1824
02:23:47.20 --> 02:23:55.92
and and a pre workout and oh no from stream tech and I've been taken even before we started

1825
02:23:55.92 --> 02:24:01.92
this podcast I took shoot no I remember you were in all fired up for the shoot tag yeah yeah

1826
02:24:01.92 --> 02:24:09.60
because it gave you the cardio yes that you'd win miss yeah so as we we have to kind of explain to people that you know

1827
02:24:11.84 --> 02:24:17.92
I don't need more I'm saying more I'm just saying echo in the past right I think it's safe to

1828
02:24:17.92 --> 02:24:23.28
say I don't feel uncomfortable by saying there was a little bit of a cardio deficit that would be

1829
02:24:23.28 --> 02:24:30.08
reached very quick I'll echo Charles on the mat so more accurately being tired was more of an issue

1830
02:24:30.08 --> 02:24:34.08
for me like dealing with being tired you know certain people will get tired but they just don't care

1831
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:37.28
like Dan Henderson like you'll get tired but yeah I'll just keep fighting you sco

1832
02:24:37.28 --> 02:24:44.08
see I didn't have that no those opposite so yeah so I so when I take the stream tech sport you

1833
02:24:44.08 --> 02:24:49.84
could feel I could feel like it's like you almost like you'd expect to get more tired than you

1834
02:24:49.84 --> 02:24:54.88
really are that's what I felt so yeah I was taking that before but that's in specific cases only

1835
02:24:54.88 --> 02:24:59.60
with jujitsu like if I'm doing like conditioning like now like a matconner something I won't take

1836
02:24:59.60 --> 02:25:03.92
it because you don't want to give yourself the extra edge yeah it's like it seems like if I'm

1837
02:25:03.92 --> 02:25:12.48
free just for conditioning it's kind of like I want to do the mat yeah yeah yeah that's it that's

1838
02:25:12.48 --> 02:25:18.64
all the supplements right there I will take the krill oil though for sure because that's gonna help me

1839
02:25:20.08 --> 02:25:27.20
last question juggle I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on leading others to a strong finish in both

1840
02:25:27.20 --> 02:25:34.56
a deployment and in the civilian life this is this is something that I saw

1841
02:25:37.12 --> 02:25:41.76
in combat even on my first deployment to Iraq and it's something that I tried to train

1842
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:50.80
out of people and that was a tendency to relax once a target was secure or the vehicles were loaded

1843
02:25:50.80 --> 02:26:00.72
and we were leaving the target area people would have a tendency to let their guard down

1844
02:26:03.28 --> 02:26:14.88
but you can't let your guard down then or ever really and in training when I was running training

1845
02:26:14.88 --> 02:26:23.52
we always hit the platoon's hard on target but we always we always hit him even harder after they

1846
02:26:23.52 --> 02:26:31.44
left the target once they were patroling back to base and their mind hit already gone home and then

1847
02:26:31.44 --> 02:26:39.36
turned off and that's when we bring it to him be hit him from multiple angles with all kinds of

1848
02:26:39.36 --> 02:26:53.04
man because I wanted to instill into them I wanted to instill that attitude the muscle memory

1849
02:26:55.20 --> 02:27:05.28
to always keep going and always stay focused because that's the mentality that you have to have

1850
02:27:05.28 --> 02:27:15.76
is that it's never finished it is never finished you always have to do more another mission

1851
02:27:15.76 --> 02:27:28.32
another task another goal and have that attitude that the enemy is always watching and waiting

1852
02:27:28.32 --> 02:27:40.40
and looking and studying you for that moment of weakness looking for you to exhale put your weapon

1853
02:27:40.40 --> 02:28:00.08
down and close your eyes that's when they attack so my rule is don't be finished be starting be

1854
02:28:00.08 --> 02:28:13.60
ready be attacking be relentless let the enemy stop let the enemy rest let the enemy finish but you

1855
02:28:16.08 --> 02:28:25.92
don't finish don't stop don't rest not until the enemy is completely destroyed

1856
02:28:25.92 --> 02:28:41.84
and even then even then when the enemy is gone that's when you turn that focus inward

1857
02:28:41.84 --> 02:28:50.48
on yourself and you take the opportunity not to rest but as always you take that

1858
02:28:50.48 --> 02:29:04.48
opportunity to make yourself better faster smarter stronger and with those goals nothing

1859
02:29:04.48 --> 02:29:20.08
is ever finished so thanks to everybody for tuning in to the podcast and listening to it
