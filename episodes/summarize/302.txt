i'm going i'm not going to say a damn word about how how you should maneuver this platoon because he was right i had i had a brigade lead and the other story is command sergeant major uh... crisp capillary was my command sergeant major when i commanded twenty-eighth infantry division uh he used to say uh as he would go out and talk to the leaders and coach and mentor leaders he would he would say leaders could stop things from getting screwed up just by the fact that they were there just by their mere presence uh so you know that's why it's so important again you know for for leaders to get out there because people are going to do the right thing and adhere to those standards when they know to leader is is there uh i was uh down in florida uh a while back doing some leadership training for a sheriff's department down there and one of the the deputy sheriff's was speaking to a group of corporals and he told the story how in the in the in the jail there uh how uh some deputies that should have been in the kitchen watching the prisoners do what they were doing uh you know cooking the meal uh just neglected to be there as they should and things really got out of hand and his point was just because the sergeant wasn't going down and checking to make sure those deputies were doing the right thing they you know the human beings are just decided hey you know this must be that important because nobody's checking on us so we're not going to be doing the right thing and so his point was again just by the mere fact of a leader being present they're going to fix things just by being there this is a reminds me of of another chapter in the book here chapter 11 an organization's personality say in 1985 i took command of an infantry company in the 28th infantry division Pennsylvania National Guard the infantry company i commanded was designated alpha company second battalion hundred and ninth infantry and the unit had an authorized strength of 144 soldiers i was honored to have an opportunity to lead the commission officers non-commission officers and soldiers assigned to the outfit i remembered reading an army leadership manual earlier in the in my career before taking this command in the manual there was a statement i will never forget it's at a military unit and any organization for that matter takes on the personality of its leader when reading that statement as a young inexperienced leader i doubted it and again you know all in line would hit the ground running you know a lot of people say don't volunteer for anything right you know I think that's a big mistake tell me you you you you got a volunteer to take on those tough things and and when you do that you know a couple of benefits first of all nobody's gonna expect you to succeed if you're just starting it you're you know out in your career you know you're not gonna have high expectations if you're just starting out and so by tackling those tough things gaining that experience you know it's just like you know in the military you know a second lieutenant army to lowest ranking commissioned officer you're expecting a second lieutenant to make a mistake you know I think it was like the second year lumbarty was the head coach he was just chewing Bart Star out relentlessly during this practice and you know talk about moral courage after practice Bart Star goes to Coach lumbarty's office and he goes hey coach can I talk to privately for a few minutes coach says yeah sure what's up and Star says to him he goes coach he goes I don't want you ever chewing me out in front of the team again said I'm the quarterback I'm leading this team he goes if they see you chewing me out the way you were chewing me out he goes I'm not going to be able to lead this team effectively in the lumbarty light bulb an often said any realized he could not treat everybody exactly the same way you know so he never chewed Bart Star out in front of the team again because he realized that what Star said was exactly correct you know he couldn't lead the team effectively if he was going to be treated like that and so again just just some great lessons we could learn from from from past leaders and you know I just tried I think we all tried to do our best when we hear these lessons to try to apply them if we could you know that's when you when you get a guy like Vincent Barty in the reputation that he has and he's humble enough to think oh if he if he can be humble in that situation and maybe less than one of his subordinates and say oh he's right oh he goes you know people are going to be watching to see are you react the first time somebody makes an honest mistake by demonstrating initiative and that was a little you know some good counsel from him so again leaders again to to develop and cultivate this trust and organization they put something out there now they really have to pay attention to make sure that they you know they they walk that the talk there and and and and do what they said they're going to do because people are going to be watching nobody's going to be leaving nobody's going to believe that written word until they actually see an action fast forward here you've talking about some of the internal attributes says if leaders cannot get in touch with their own feelings they will have difficulty understanding the feelings of others leaders must practice self awareness and mindfulness once one develops self-worth and you talk about I'm I'm fast forward a little bit you talk about journaling is a good technique like writing down what your thoughts what your feelings are so that you get some perspective on them I'm going to fast forward a little bit um once one develop self awareness one can then become better at controlling emotions followers look to leaders to be able to get things get stable when things get chaotic controlling ones emotions has many personal organizational and societal benefits I remember when I was young I was a young inexperienced leader I acted out in front of a group of my followers showing great displeasure not with them or maybe it was even some senior leader who was coaching me but said you know there's three things a commander could do to positively impact the battle once it begins he said the commanders use of fires you know close air support and direct fire the use of the reserves you know because usually the commander retains the authority of when to use his reserve and the third thing is personal presence on the battlefield and he said those are the three things a commander could do to influence the battle once it begins and and that always stuck to me stuck with me especially that notion of the personal presence on the battlefield and just having that personal presence there which help I think you know soldiers in battle or in a civilian sector you know employees in an organization realize that hey this leaders out with us sharing the load sharing the danger you know sharing what's coming our way and and you know they kind of get bolstered by that whole notion well I can attest to that I remember seeing you out on the battlefield the body looking over and say well there's the brigade commander I Roger that I guess he's I guess he's not sitting back in the talk all the time he's out here with the troops like you said seeing what's happening understanding what's happening and taking that risk I mean if you were in Ramadi and you were out in the city you were at risk and IEDs and and roadside bombs and RPGs and and machine guns don't they don't care what your name is they don't care what your rank is when I when I talk about vulnerability uh and we are to talk a little bit about the first part it's about uh having the courage to leave your comfort zone allowing yourself to be vulnerable to try something maybe you haven't tried before something that's a little bit hard but the other um aspects of vulnerability is putting yourself out there and exposing yourself to your followers and I'll tell you what I mean by that one way to expose yourself to your followers and I I think this is a helpful technique is sharing stories with your followers about times maybe when you tried something and you failed you know or or you made a mistake and uh the reason I think that's important is because you know followers look at at a leader the thing man they're in this position of leadership everything they touch in life must you know must have turned a goal they probably never made any mistakes so they want to be in this position of leadership and we know nothing could be farther from the truth so by by explaining to your followers how hey you know I've I've tried and I've failed sometimes and I've made mistakes and this is how is it able to overcome these mistakes that that inspires uh those followers and then the the other piece about vulnerability is having the humility to ask people on your team fast forward a little bit identify your core values to develop strong character you must take the time to figure out what you stand for and what your core values really are this came to light for me many years ago I attended a dinner at which the speaker gave an impassion talk about his own personal core values the next day as I was still thinking about what I heard I realized if someone asked me what my personal core values were I would not be able to give an answer sure I had values I tried to be an ethical person but to that point I never took the time to think long and hard about exactly what I stood for and my principles I never took the time to consider what values were most important to me important you know the other thing about values if if you don't understand what your own personal core values are when you make personal decisions or when it comes a time for you to make a personal decision about something I really believe you have to factor your your personal core values into decisions you make so if you don't have those core values articulated in your own mind how are you going to factor them in your decision and the same with organizations you know organizations many organizations have organizational values but when the leadership team gets together with the CEO and they're in the you know they're going through this decision making process how many of them actually factor the organizational values into the decision that they're making which I I would think I would just guess many don't even think about their values when they're making a business decision which is crazy to think about you know the the more you get down there you know I call it muddy muddy boots leadership they're more to get down there talk to the troops you know whether it be militarious civilian then you're able to develop that trust too because you're right the first time you go down and ask somebody hey how's it going they're not going to be totally honest with you if they don't know you but the more they get used to seeing you come around and and just having a rapport and see that you're hey normal guy and you really do want the best for the organization they're going to loosen up until later truth also don't burn your sources you know don't don't go back and say hey echo I need to talk to you John Gronsky said you were a tyrant and all that's not you're never going to get any information again and and then you know when you get it out there you know you've got to you've got to share it in a an multitude of ways you know when you're speaking to people one-on-one you've got a communicate that vision you're speaking to a group of 500 you've got to communicate the vision through email through your website through whatever you know social media means you might want to use but the vision then has to be consistent you know can't be a new flavor of the month or a new vision of the quarter you know like you said visions could change but but people have to know that you're expecting tomorrow to be a better day than today and who doesn't want to be around a leader who believes that tomorrow is going to be better than today you know because you know we want to move forward and and that that's what I mean by by positive energy and like we talked about earlier in the podcast here you have to have an action plan a believable action plan you know if you want to be known as as a as a positive leader because people aren't going to to follow you if they just think you're glad handing everything and you really don't have a plan to back it up that's important you know I did try to get out there a lot not because I had any type of you know courage to speak of but just because I felt it was necessary to do and the other thing for any military leader listening to this and and really it applies to business leaders too I would encourage my staff to get out there and and the reason I encourage my staff to get out there is because I felt it was important for my staff to also gain ground truth if if if the staff was gaining with they thought was to truth from reading reports they were missing about 80% of what was happening so although I know you know in the military a lot of times especially in operations like that the staff needs to be back doing staff work I always encourage them that hey they they did have to make time to actually get out there talk to troops see areas with their own eyes and again just a history from lesson hurt and force 28th infantry division fighting in the hurt and forest in in November 1944 the battle of Schmidt was a devastating time for the 28th infantry division in about four days over 6,000 casualties and one thing that was written about that period is it's said that general code to who is a division commander at the time most reports I read said he never even went as far forward as one of his regimental command posts and the staff did not go forward either not and we can make a decision so that's important stuff fast forward a little bit you know let's get a chapter in here called keeping your feet on the ground which is about humility you say I worked for an arrogant leader before it was not any fun all of us who work for this man felt our opinions were not valued he was the kind of guy who said things like when I want your opinion I'll tell you what it is stereotypical military but not actual military we believe we were not respected and we felt more like objects rather than we were part of the team the results are initiative imagination and creativity were stifled as you could imagine the leader failed again this is a this is one of those false images of military leadership does it happen yes it does happen and here's something else let's say about this you want to know what it does happen more often in the military and one of the reason it happens more often in the military is because in the military you're only in command for two years generally speaking so most of the enlisted guys you work in for a jerk or an arrogant person it takes them three months or three to six months ago hey this guy really is arrogant then at six months are like the path is kind of a routine it essentially is and this is important as with a routine where if you have a routine there's way way way less opportunity to make to have like oh like a decision making conundrum right because the routine the decision you have already made before part of the routine while you're not angry hang on through emotional departure exactly the question because you haven't had a freaking fish save a few hours either way if you're angry even you already know because dinner's soon or you know when the dinner is seem saying if you have a routine or lunch or but we'll back with whatever you're about to eat whatever you're almost almost all right take you off the path here's the here's what Ronald does he he just waits he waits for the people with no routine or an or he'll slide into your routine but a lot of times for people like me in this case where the little the little crack in the routine he's right there he's like no I realized how hard that that was for him and and again I think that the you know the lesson for anybody out here listening is hey you know you could be you know you could be a jackass you know if you want to be and not be approachable and you know my way or the highway I'm the boss you know who are you to tell me what to do we're giving me advice and it's you know like you said you don't have to worry about the buying if they came up with that I go into every meeting with my subordinates when I was in a pool tune when I was a task in a commander right now in the business world I walk into a meeting with my people my goals to use their plan that's my goal I don't want to use whatever I'm coming up with I want to use theirs and if you have that goal at the beginning that's going to lead you to the best possible place and look like you said if their plan is dumb which which you know you get to people come up with some dumb plans occasionally but occasionally some people come up with some dumb ideas that's okay ask them some earnest questions and they're going to see that their plan is the reality of their plan which is dumb but it has everything to do with winning a championship you know and exactly what you said you know you might have a win here there if you're not character based but if you want to be a champion if you want to have long term success you got to be a character based leader at least that's where I believe um another sub headline here is know your job and do your job and this I might might know that I took on this one it is there is such a thing as a stupid question and when we explain the you people always say oh there's no such thing as a stupid question if you show up to a job so they didn't realize that the call trail through the hurt and forest which they were sending Sherman tank down Sherman tank is eight and a half feet wide the call trail was nine feet wide I mean it was not a good you know means you know MSR means supply route or or good route of any sort for those tanks to be going along and so to lessen there is because the commander didn't get out on the battlefield because the staff didn't get out there they were relying on maps they didn't get the full understanding of what that hurt and forest area was was like so again for any civilian leader any military leader absolutely important not only to get out there yourself but to get your your staff the ones that you depend on to advise you to get out there as well you know there's another piece of this when when you are the leader and you what you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to be detached you're not supposed to go out there and get in the firefighter not supposed to go out there and and run the marketing meeting or meet with the client necessarily or get and start manufacturing stuff on the line you're supposed to go out and look do you do you maybe do a couple moves on the manufacturing line to make sure you understand what's happening and so he introduces him he can see that the kid's kind of floating around not making the best decisions and so he says hey warriors live by a code and I point out you know the Marine Corps values the the the Ranger code the I just point out the you know the ancient you know the Samurai code the Viking gods I'm not putting them all in the book and say hey you need to make your own code and the kid ends up writing his own code and the uncle approves it this warrior kid code and then eventually I wrote another book called the code the evaluation of protocols which literally has like a code saying hey as an adult you still need a code you still need to figure out what it is you're trying to do what he trying to do with your life and if again if you have this code in place what I did is I went around to representative sampling of soldiers who were part of that brigade I would talk to a PFC that had like a year in Norm you know I would talk to a major who had may or may be 16-17 years in the army and every and a few folks in between there I mean 3000 soldiers can't talk to all of them and say hey where do you want to see this brigade go and the question I would ask them I would say hey you know if you fell asleep for five years and woke up five years from now what would you want to see this brigade look like then you know and the funny thing is whether it was a soldier low rank one year experience or higher ranking officer with 17 years experience Humvee there's some dismounts going into a building that is they believed in surgeons were in and an insurgent fires an RPG a rock repelligernade at at this uparmer Humvee that Georgian's in his end and and just like wings it you know the slight damage to the Humvee he gets knocked down out of the the gunners hatch gets back up there he sees that insurgents are pinning down these dismounts that are out there so he jumps down into the driver's compartment drives that uparmer Humvee between where the insurgents are firing and these dismounts that were pinned down gets back up into the gunners compartment and lays down suppress the fire on these insurgents allowing these dismounts to the disengage and then continue to mission all this after suffering these wounds in that attack back in the fall now how many you know how many people would you know leave Remoddy with with you know honorable wounds like he did and then fight to get back over there and and that taught me that whether you lead an organization of eight hundred or you lead an organization of eight the leadership challenges are there you know it doesn't it doesn't get any easier or harder depending on the number of people you lead you know you still got those challenges the the folks on your team are still expecting you to be a good leader a positive influence on them and as I mentioned in the book I'm just glad this this guy had the the personal courage to come up and and tell me about it because it was really it was really life changing for me because that really got me on a journey to really study what trust is all about and not only how to cultivate trust but also how to repair trust if if you unfortunately break it you know and no no you know uh a friend of mine lend me a rella he graduated from west point in like nineteen fifty eight or something uh retired as a colonel and the army he wrote this book uh about character and in the book he would go and interview different leaders who were known to be character based leaders and one of the people he interviewed was coach Krishewski coach K from Duke and uh in the in this interview he was doing with coach K you know lend lends to coach K like what this character have to do with winning a basketball game and coach K's answer was you know character has absolutely nothing at all to do with winning a basketball game and you say hey what's the name of this vehicle how far can this gun shoot how many rounds can we get a if you're asking questions that you should have done some research and know when you showed up you're wrong if you show up to a manufacturer to run a manufacturing plant and you show up and say hey what is it we're making or how many employees do we have or who's in charge of the day shift if you're asking questions that a little bit of research could have answered that you didn't do a good job prepare you don't you so know your job that's my part of know your job there is stupid questions don't show up your first day and ask stupid questions that you should have known if you're taking an ounce of effort to to figure out what was happening you know you're but nobody should expect somebody to kind of sit us down and tell us about hey these these are the things you really got to look out for that that's that realistic that's just just not going to happen know it is not uh chapter 18 this one's always a big topic getting buy in Napoleon used a technique to obtain buy in it was the same technique used by the union general who commanded the army of the platomic at Gettysburg general meat meat was a disciple of Napoleon the technique was called a war council on July 2nd 1863 mead brought his lieutenant into his makeshift headquarters at the lifester house he had in a agenda that evening the council had to provide their recommendations on one of three courses of action mead would have to decide one the union army should leave the battlefield to the union army should stay in fight and offensive battle three the union army should stay and fight a defensive battle mead began by asking his lower ranking and least experienced lieutenant to voice their opinions first he used this method because he knew if the more senior officer spoke first more junior officers in terms of rank reputation or experience might feel too intimidated to disagree after all this was by design a hierarchical organization mead knew he had to get the lower ranking leaders to speak first in order to get their unvarnished thoughts after everyone spoke mead decided the union would stay in fight a defensive battle the rest as they say is history the union army was victorious and won the battle and would go on to win the war although would take another bloody two years before the Confederate army laid down their arms I when when people asked me this question how do you get people to buy into the plan I say let them come up with a plan you don't have to worry about buying anymore you don't have to worry about you came up with it hey could I have a minute could I talk to you and you know leader is you know checking their phone while you're talking to them or they're you know tapping something on the keyboard or they're their computer while you're talking to them or you're talking to them they're looking off at somebody else you know it's kind of like wow is this guy really listening to me yeah um fast forward a little bit chapter 25 iron sharpens iron as iron sharpens iron so one person sharpens another proverbs 27 17 and this is right in line with what you were just talking about demonstrate initiative and attribute I felt strongly about was initiative at every level of leadership throughout the division and this is again this is when you were in a you know leadership position this was a result of my combat experience in Romadi Iraq I saw during my time in Romadi how it was essential that junior leaders demonstrated initiative in order to get ahead of the decision making loop of our enemies I believed if we did not encourage initiative in steady state operations at training exercise subordinate leaders would not display the necessary level of initiative when in combat I put out written guidance and I continually reinforced stating I believe demonstrating high levels of initiative was worth the risk of making honest mistakes so this is exactly what you were just talking about if you've got a team that's not making decisions you're you're you're the problem and the way you the way you instilled that culture inside your division when you were division commander was by talking about it by putting out written guidance by demonstrating it you know as a leader I found you know give the task give the purpose but don't give the how you know give the what and the why but not the how and usually you know those people who work for us are going to figure out a better way to do with them we would have figured out it's really easy to understand those all this is never going to work all we're screwed all this is horrible you we all know people like that and it seems easier to identify maybe I shouldn't use the word hard to understand it can be hard to understand hard to identify someone that has positive energy it's really easy to there's more people it seems that have negative energy and occasionally it gets someone that's just got super positive and and then you'll remember that and you'll remember how they're you know what their response was when something was going wrong and how they took it and they look around back I don't think leaders should treat everybody on the on the team equally you got and when I say that this one I mean by it you got to get to know the the people on your team everybody's a little bit different so you got to really get to know what makes them tick and and what's going to motivate certain people as opposed to motivating others everybody kind of wanted the same thing they wanted to be well trained so if we had a deploy we'd be able to do our jobs successfully and that ended up essentially what what what the vision was so what it taught me and this goes for any business leader out there trying to develop a vision for their organization and many organizations are working distributed now you know with the pandemic and everything else it's try to get you know when I say shared vision try to get a representative sample if you could of where people would like to see it go and ultimately use the leader like you said you you've got a broader view of everything but again you don't know what a life experience that person had so asking people their opinion we talk about respect I think one of the best ways you could show somebody on your team that you respect them is by asking their opinion could you imagine working for somebody for ten years and you've never had that person you worked for ever ask you for your opinion I mean you know how how could that make you feel good and and how could that make you feel that that leader of yours respect you man you never even asked me what I thought you know and then what you have to look for as a leader is you have to make sure that things are going in the right direction and the test that you should put on yourself is like it the basically the momentum is the momentum that we're going in correct because the momentum could be wrong and the momentum could be right and if the momentum is right cool you can just get out of the way if the momentum is wrong that's we're going to have to step in and stop it and and one of the places where you see this is well in combat when things lag you know you get an element that's not moving as quickly as they're supposed to move they're lagging they're moving too slow and they don't even realize that they can't realize it because they're doing it you can come in and say hey we got to step it up and then you're going to get crushed because you lack the humility and you're not being vulnerable enough to say hey I actually don't know so up and down the chain command just like you said no one expects the leader to know everything as a leader we think everyone expresses know everything hey you know like you know I don't know how much food there's gonna be here or whatever so you know grab something this was like cool and I know you've written about this because I've read it but having the humility to ask people on your team what they think and how they would do something and then having the humility to follow through with their recommendation when you see it's a good recommendation that should be followed and and again not just having that attitude that hey I'm the leader you've only got two years on the job what could you possibly know you know more than I and it's like no in fact there are so few catastrophic events that can actually happen that there's almost nothing that you can catastrophize with me you're going to get through just about everything that's kind of like the whole thing if everything is a priority nothing is a priority exactly you know you you really got to be clear about what the priorities are and then get everybody working toward achieving those you know probably maybe two or three priorities so things that are really important prioritize an execute I believe I believe that's the word um I want to close out with one last section here um you know jacco i think you putting that emphasis on code and in in that book is one of the best things you've ever done because if you want to keep people on an ethical path one of the guardrails to to stay on that ethical path is by actually writing down what your own personal code is and then that will help you stay grounded and help you stay on that path that that's just a great technique to use to keep somebody you know staying within those limits because how many times have we seen CEO CEOs governors you know stray ethically off the path president and you know that that really taught me that you know it's it's kind of like being a parent you know kids aren't looking for friends they're looking for parents you know and and supportants aren't looking for for buddies they're looking for followers that think of count on
