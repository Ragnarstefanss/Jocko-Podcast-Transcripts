So we asked around and Alberto was sort of doing all the translation and we eventually found this street pastor who said, look, I know the gang leaders are both of these guys, I can probably get you in if you want, so I'll ask the question, so he got his, he got two phones out actually, and he called the leaders of both gangs and had them on speaker phone next to each other, which is bizarre, both of these leaders were both in jail, right, because they were, and he got them, they were, and he got them both on speaker phone and said, look, I've got these two two gringoes, I mean he wasn't malbusters, and Mexican, but he called us both gringoes and said, look, they want to walk through your turf, you know, will you let them, and to my surprise, these both these leaders like, yeah, absolutely, you know, as long as you give a fair honest representation of our story, you want to tell you our story, and why we have these gangs, but he said, just give us twenty fryzers because we're just going to even clean up the graffiti and pick up the trash from the streets, they wanted to show the best side of their gang walls, and it was the most bizarre experience, but we went through these areas, escorted by these kids, ten, twelve year olds, we had covered in tattoos with pistols down there jeans, and they showed us the Castle O'Cuz, the Crazy House, where they taught each other, and they, they should, oh, this is where we killed, you know, this person, this is where we hung, it was like tragic stuff, but in the most surreal setting, and it was, it was a very bizarre experience to go and see that, and we saw a guy shot at the side of the street, you know, just in, just, yeah, from the gang walls, so, and, and I'm not into voyeurism, I don't go there to sort of glamorize any of this, it's trying to show what, you know, the, what the struggle is like for a lot of people living in these circumstances and, and not shy away from some of those really difficult but compelling stories. and I think it was me screaming that woke my brother up and he was relatively un-ingered, I mean he'd been bashed around, but he hadn't got anything broken, so I couldn't move, I was in such pain, been odd, the guide, he was pretty much unconscious and Pete, my brother, he came over and, you know, he's done a few trips, but nothing like this, you know, he used working in finance, you know, he's sort of for, he's back in finance, you know, well, no, it's the interesting thing, whilst Pete rescued us, he went and shouted for help, luckily the sound of the car crashing had woken up some local villagers and my, they'd come to investigate, probably to go out and how I may be for enough locals to come to carriers out, but then they had to carriers and my, through the jungle, to the local village, well you weren't bleeding, I mean, I wasn't bleeding, but I was bleeding bleeding, like you weren't, like threatening blood, no, it was just my arm was just completely mangled, the driver sadly was in a very different position he'd broken, everything is body, it's neck, you know, he was somewhere at the mountains, that's going to find him, we were taken to a very small clinic in the local village, and when I say small owners like chicken running around the ward, this was basic stuff, but luckily they're, yes, they're qualified, it was basic, they were rolling the hospital and chickens, but they had more feet, thankfully, so that, you know, took away some of the pain, but I mean you know of course when you go to controversial place you're going to get a bit of flack from different groups you know you didn't show my tribe and what we do or especially if you go to like the whole Israel Palestine question or if you're traveling in somewhere like Iran you know it's difficult it's difficult to tell everyone story you never gonna succeed in that but for me it was actually the slightly indirect feedback when when you get the head of a charity saying thank you you know we've been trying to put our country on the map for the last 20 years and just one of your episodes is double that revenue or something like that or you get individuals who call you and say you inspire me to quit my job in finance and you know go build a clinic in Nepal whatever it might be and as a result you know I've personally been asked to be an ambassador for probably hundreds of charities I'm currently ambassador for about 20 or so charities and it's things like that that make it all worthwhile for me yeah either way get on the shirt it's called the shirt locker new shirt

seen where how we got where we're at we have the grounded podcast we have the warrior kid podcast we also the the underground jockel underground dot com we're doing we're recording a little podcast there the reason that we're doing that is so that we don't have to have sponsors because why because we don't want sponsors because then they dictate what we can and can't do which we don't like we also don't want to have the platforms themselves be able to dictate what we can and cannot do now look we the platforms been good to us so far everyone's been okay with what we're doing that's fine what happens when they're not what happens when they decide they're just going to take a sort of injecting advertisements onto our podcast and when I say all I mean everyone all of our suit what do we do then we don't have control so we made we made the jockel underground podcast jockel underground dot com across a dollars and eighteen cents a month great way to support what we're doing if you can't look if you can't afford it we're look we are a podcast of the people that's why this podcast is free that's why this podcast doesn't have advertising other than what we're doing right now what

done that you've seen what you've seen don't stay in the same spot do like levison wood does literally and metaphorically go out go go see go do go live go explore and until next time this is echo and juggle out you're eight like a food or something and it says all natural then you find out wait it's not all natural though like I guess it's like they play all natural cheese puffs right come on bra it's like they play you you know the words like it's all natural given the fact that it's not all natural you seem saying it's almost like that where it's like I, so I had this little flip camera, that you're the interesting thing is actually you'd think sometimes that it would be tricky to film in these places, but actually having a camera does open up conversations, people are like, oh hang on, I want my first graph taken, or I want you to, I want to tell you my story, and particularly in places that don't get many tourists, because if you go to touristy places, people aren't that interesting, get the photos taken or telling you their story, but if you go to Honduras, I mean there's one story from there, we were in a town called San Pedro Sula, which other than Ciada Twaras, I think was the murder capital of the world, this is where the two main cartels you've got, MS 13 and Barrio 18, these two rival gangs that do pretty bad things to each other are based, they've got their own neighbourhoods, and we wanted to walk straight through this city, and the only way to do so was to cross between these two ganglands, but of course the police and the army were like, look, we don't go in there, we can't rely on us for backing. so now you got cameras rolling all the time and I watched some of your some of this stuff that's on YouTube I watch you rolling up to that offensive and the guys like all right lunch break and there's some you know having work with the Iraqi soldiers of bombs I was like I know what's going on there I know what that feels like yeah like you got about two weeks for today to make that happen to go uh echo Charles is any questions from anything else uh remember when you lost your wallet remember do you think if you didn't lose your wallet you would not have gone into the military when you think about it I think that you know when I lost my wallet the inspiration you know the main lesson that I learnt there was kind of told by this young lieutenant who found it was go-in travel and and perhaps if I hadn't have traveled if I hadn't have got those expert early experiences if I hadn't have had the gun pulled on me by the the guy in the taxi in Zimbabwe then maybe I wouldn't have enough stories to get me through the interviews that got me into the army so who knows I mean hindsight obviously a great thing but yeah I think you know take opportunities when when they come come along say thank you to people you know you never know be courteous and it's it's you know writing back to that guy and just say thank you for handing all it back you know got me all those tips in the form of that six page essay but you know a snake like when you're when you're sort of out taking a dump as a snake might go and bite on the ass or whatever in my be you've got to be really careful we were camping the whole time staying inside the national parks we've got a very we we were sort of greeted with them by the Botswana government with with the outlustrous back because they said look you know not only encouraging tourism showcasing the Botswana such a tourism conservation success actually and and so we were able to camp inside these national parks and and really gets to know the wildlife but if you can't afford it that's cool email assistance ad jockel underground dot com we'll still hook you up that's what we're here for we have a youtube channel where echo post videos and you can subscribe to that one also origin USA has a YouTube channel is that what it's called origin USA has a youtube channel yet

series Yeah, and even even, you know, I start off joking in the early part of this, you know, I'll know and whoever invite me in their house and then as I'm sitting in a listening view talk and I've been to, I mean, obviously I've been all over the world and been to all kinds of different countries and it's the same thing when you actually when you actually get past that get but underneath that political vision that we have of a place, you know, I've had people treat me unbelievably well all over the world and that's why you have to get, you have to, you have to make those human connections

have him on here for sure we were talking about exploration that's the name of his new book the art of exploration echo seems like exploration topic of the day can you recommend some ways we can explore getting better as humans for sure what he got so I think keeping ourselves capable good call really you know look we have a path the path is hard not all the time but we left that behind and carried on the journey and continued around the Gulf and and like I said I didn't want this journey to be just about the conflict because that's what we associate so much with with the region but to then jump out of Iraq and then be in southern Iraq actually we were in the in amongst the the marshes around Nazarene Badrera you know this is the birthplace of civilisation god and of Eden and so on and to be in amongst the marsh Arabs I don't know if you served down there with these these these are very traditional tribes who literally you know live amongst the marshes in these in these ancient ways of living in the hot and called Mudhif and you know fishing and and farming buffalo And the first thing they put in front of me is some kind of crazy like, just like, like, you mean like, no, it's like octopus shrimp and like raw fish all in one thing. so he may be going I don't know he's going somewhere we don't know where he came in we don't know where he came from we don't know where he's going we had another guest on and covered another book on here Holly who's book only cry for the living and she interviewed a lot of those women and what they went through so you know liberation was the the understatement of the year for what was happening to the people inside those villages that were you know and cities that were run by ISIS did you what you you're not I know that you're you don't carry a weapon when you do this stuff you just wearing body armor we managed to pick up some body armor from a bill you know to bought something local shop and not off you go I know it was a it was kind of bizarre experience because we managed to hitch a life to the front line where these sort of that you know the the Iraqi volunteers these weren't the Iraqi army these were literally the guys too old or too young to join the join the military and they were fighting on their home turf they were fighting their neighbors so these were mainly sheer militia and fighters who volunteered mainly to come out of retirement to basically going you know kick ISIS off the of the land You know, because you know, the guys just know it's a, you know, I like being out here Like, oh, you know, if I don't make it, you know, like, well, probably might not be that bad, you know, and I not to put up with this. and off we went, and that was a really enjoyable journey because the guy that came with me might my guide for that one was actually a guy who had known for a number of years called Alberto, who was the guy that got me into photography in the first place and he'd lived in Mexico, he'd never walked anywhere in his life, anywhere, and he certainly wasn't a professional guide, he was a studio photographer, he was far more at home, sitting on yachts with supermodels, but he had just got divorced and was looking for an adventure, so I said, let me come with me, we're going to go and have some fun, and off we went and we walked for six months through all these random countries and we went through the ganglands in Honduras, met the cartels along the way, we sort of had meetings with all sorts of gangsters, it was, that was a wild trip as well. And that's often what I also say about Iraq, you know, it's like I would kick in the door to a building and there'd be, you know, a family in there and they, that's trying to build a business of selling whatever dates and the moms, you know, trying to so stuff that she can sell in the neighborhood and the kids are wanting to play soccer and they're just normal people. But it's a big challenge, you know, you've got to prove to you, man, they're not going to, they're not just going to follow you until they know you're not, you know, not a dick, basically. But what if, and this might go outside of the scope of even what you're talking about, what if you eat some chicken, that's like dry or like, well, you know, some new food like an S-car go or something like this. and it's like I feel like really feel like smoking it's really like you know on my mind to call your life coach but at the same time we wanted to we wanted to see what was going on because nobody was filming this you know the any news reports that were coming out were coming out from Baghdad or a bill that's very few people were getting onto the front line and actually seeing what life is like for on both sides you know yeah to double tracks you know you need jockel to help you get past the moment a week this you're like kind of like a therapist in a way or what you call like a life coach But, you know, I think a lot of it was down to the fact that we'd found this guy who, he wasn't a cowboy, he was like, you know, I live, I've lived in these, in, on this, on, in these neighborhoods, all my life and sort of the camera come, crew come through or not. I met the guys and you know, you sort of towards its handhairs that you're going to have this sort of general Montgomery moment where you're sort of, you know, standing on a land Rover, sort of addressing your soldiers as they're all on parade. and I think that's what you got to remind yourself so when everything's really badly I try and just convince myself even if it's like a delusional that this is a great opportunity absolutely true man absolutely true well like I said probably a good place to wrap work approaching three hours right now thanks for joining us absolutely and and more important thanks for your service thanks your service to great Britain one of our maybe our most maybe our strongest ally not only for your service but your your fathers and your grandfather's I mean they'd been a booktrick about him and he was there fighting on his most bike with his big you know six foot sniper rifle and he agreed to speak to me he didn't normally do journalists interviews particularly not with with with Brits that's for sure but he agreed to speak to me sort of soldiers soldier when I sort of told him I was in the in the Paris and he said well I've you know probably killed some of your friends as long as you don't mind that Well, it was, I can thank my brother because when I, when I sort of figured out where I was, I crawled out the car, thought I'd lost my arm, my first instinct was to go find my arm, you know, it's seen on the beach and saving private Ryan, where he's looking, he's looking like days and confused, that was me in this car, I couldn't find it, then I realized it was still attached, but I couldn't feel it, it was pointing the wrong way, it was completely, I mean you can see the scar there, I had to sort of snap it back into place, that's when the pain started I know I watched a video about your grandfather and it was just awesome that that that he was out there like you holding the line against tyranny and evil and thanks for sharing some of your stories I need you following me on like I said there's ten books I always try and prepare I couldn't read ten books get ready for this thing um to a ton of great stories and and the lessons that you you share and the experiences allow all of us to learn through your vicariously through your explorations of the world which you've made the best of I don't recommend them But that's what I wanted to show you I wanted to show these really start differences and this traditional way of life the beduined you know I studied all about Lawrence Arabia and the old sort of arabist explorers people like Wolf with Essageau who crossed the empty quarter and so to then go from there into a man which is a beautiful country you've got these amazing endless and dunes and very traditional way of life there So the Paris, you know, like I say, I'm not the sort of biggest muscle bound guy in the world and looking around at some of the other guys that had been in the Paris, there's quite a there's quite an aggressive mentality to get in there and and like I said, there was a hundred applicants for only six places in the end. yeah you probably need unless you are just dedicating 24 hours a day for meal prep and you have your spare out shopping you're out harvesting your own meat you're out you're out in the garden pulling up carrots you know if that's what you're doing you can probably get away without supplementation look we we know that we don't we want to eat clean right if you're eating clean you don't need it the chances that are pretty small it was only there was only ever three others traveling at once we it meant that we could actually go and achieve something that had never been done before which is actually travel through all these multiple countries so going through places like Syria we're embedded with the the Kurdish militia in Iraq we managed to join a group called the Hashtad the PMF the popular mobilisation forces who are sometimes the bad guys but these are the guys fighting against ISIS on this occasion but they're also Iranian backed militias I was embedded with them on the final awejya offensive which is the final battle against ISIS in Iraq on the front line I mean that was that was something else I mean it was it was an entire Afghan tour in three days I mean it was it was intense but now you guys are now you guys are the camera crew all the just the three of us Well, it's, you know, it's, I mean, the basics of, you know, if you're going to a seven-course meal, it's like which, which knife and fork do you start with first? I mean, they're getting into Iran as a trick you want, because initially they would like know where we didn't, you know, especially from the UK, when we're not friends right now. Going back to my original point of going back to places that I'd studied, my studies at university have mainly been about, you know, the Middle East, about places where the old British Empire had a legacy, all places in, you know, in the news now, current affairs, and obviously Russia, Iran were both pretty high up on the agenda. So, I, after sort of really, you know, going through some heart-wrenching decision-making, I thought, you know what, I think now's the time to do something else. I don't know if that's going to sound right, but you're going beneath the political atmosphere to the actual other human beings that are living their lives, that are, you know, trying to earn a living, trying to raise their family, trying to build their future. and we we met these ISIS fighters we got a camera in the face and that that was quite rare so it was it was fascinating to to see what was going on and to see the reality of life and and these guys the the volunteers who were fighting they've been fighting solidly for three years so you mentioned that the lunch break coming literally in the middle of the battle that the truck turned up with with the chicken sandwiches on on the back and and people just stopped there like well the fight's not going anywhere everyone just sat down and and had the chicken sandwich and then carried on and it was it was a kind of bizarre experience I'm ready for something cool you know about banana cream that's not what you got that's interesting because that's not like an obvious flavor but once you say you're like You know, what was what I was doing right, you know, but you know, it happened I mean, we were in South Sudan, in the middle of a war zone, you know, it was, I mean, they weren't there at the time, it was just me, but, um, I was going to say, because you become close and then they're like, hey, I'm out. so it is a new art form of writing and it's in a book called final spin which is coming out if you want to get the first adish better order it now leadership strategy and tactics the code the evaluation of protocol discipline goes freedom field manual way of the warrior kid one two three and four my key in the dragons about face I wrote the forward on the new one and of course extreme ownership and that economy of leadership I have a leadership consultancy called echelon front we saw problems through leadership you go to echelon front dot com if you want me and my team to come and work with your company that's what we do we have eF online online training leadership you can get it anywhere you can get on your phone we're on there all the time we're doing live Q&A's we've got a bunch of courses to take it's freaking no probably not but if when it comes to banana because I don't like pumpkin pie you know how certain people like really love pumpkin pie and that's it no it's kind of you need to make one of these that was very motivated by that jocquads in his way we'll just say also we got folks I can't have a foot type canvas dot com decoder my are making cool stuff to hang on your wall we got a bunch of books look all the books I talked about today uh by levison wood the latest one that should be available for pre-order right now it's called the art of exploration that's when I was reading out of today we got final spin which is a look it's a novel because it's not specifically true maybe they're like so it just depends on what you mean by all it depends on what you mean by natural depends on what you mean by iconic and it depends on what you mean by American but you're not playing that game over here origin USA or it USA is in the name there's no plan words there's nothing like that no trickery made no without compromise jeans boots rash guards t-shirts what what else you want So he, you know, he likes to tell me he was off fighting the Russians and Germany, you know, it, it, it really, you know, realistically he was, he was out there. yes sir you have battlefield this is learning lessons as we walk historical battlefield just did recently did get his bird we're planning others in the future again go do go to echelonfront dot com look for events on there if you want to come and meet us you don't have dinner you want to walk the battlefield you want to do Q&A face to face we look for to see you know at those if you want to help service members active and retired their families gold star families check out marklies mom momily she has a charity organization helping out all these groups all over the place if you want to donate or get involved to go to America's mighty warriors dot org and you know it's not a thing it's a thing for us there's what I'm saying it is now so what and you're talking even from like a banking standpoint where it's like And you know, if we're all in a boat crew and there's eight of us in the boat crew, it's possible to sort of like shrink your head down a little bit and release your posture a little bit and not have your head carrying any weight, which means that everyone else carrying the weight. it's a life coach your life coach because you don't like a coach with a baseball bat essentially know the life coach is the the what you call the classic with a stereotypical situation is like but I just need three seats I can't I can't help you sometimes in the SEAL teams I would tell guys like hey this if you do if you make this mistake I can't help you you want to do something like look you do some dumb stuff I got you if you do something at this level of stupidity I can't there's literally nothing I can do don't be doing dumb shit So I know you, you went on like, uh, this is, I don't know if Americans do this or not. And so she was like, is there any way you can, you know, somehow, one, you're sitting around plotting an extra trip, why not you send me some ambulances, raise some money, or something like that. And we drove all the way through Europe through the Middle East, went through Syria, you know, all these crazy places and two months later went to, you know, finally delivered these ambulances to this little clinic in Malawi. but I need that energy right now say hey let's pay that price you know there's no sacrifice no sacrifice well pound it energy drink I don't I don't even need energy right now I just want to drink that energy drink and guess what I'm going to be more healthy afterwards when it comes down to it I'm going to be more healthy I like the way you kick these stories off with like I've always been fascinated with you know how sharp a shark's teeth could be. Walking the Americas, so I wanted to do something in Central America, I'd have this girl from this Mexican girlfriend, so I knew Mexico quite well, but I was fascinated by the ancient mine civilization, I wanted to go to see places like Honduras and got a Marlera in Colombia because I knew that I would have a bit of edge, and so I decided to walk from where the Spanish first landed in the U.C. temperature, give it a bit of historical context all the way to South America across the Daryngap, which is probably one of the most remote and fierce, most stretch of the jungle, anywhere in the world, so that was another six months, another two thousand miles of walking, again, lots of scrapes there as well. and you know you could see the black flags of ISIS in these villages and we just drive up to and spread out bond the shit out of it and then go in there and we were in the mix you know right on the front line filming everything and liberating these villages and capturing ISIS we caught three ISIS commanders and I've still got a f*** And that was it, I thought I was a goner and it was almost comedic in the sense that it didn't, it literally flew off the edge and we were airborne for what felt like an eternity, it was probably just a few seconds, but it was the only part of the, the road side where there were no trees because it was forested this, this bank, but we went off the bit where there was obviously a river running through, so it just kept on going and when we finally did hit the deck, it bounced and rolled and probably rolled 10 times, always the bottom of the valley and somehow I stayed in the vehicle, the driver and this random other guy that he picked up a local had been thrown through the windscreen somewhere up on the mountain, we stayed in the car and the entire city has been built for like 20 years or something like that and just everything is brand new and to the the highest standards of luxury in everything it's like you can't get more of a start contrast. There was like, you know, the homeless guys sort of taken a leak off the bridges, we were going under it. it's a it's a philosophical book as well not just like you said a book I read stories I read a lot of stories I like to read stories So for me the validation it's not just about ratings because obviously that's a lot to do with the the media landscape and the current politics of what's going on it's changed enormously just in the seven or eight years that I've been doing this you know in terms of TV what is you know I'm going to give this a go what's the worst that can happen so we decided to go and just do this and the idea was to go and look at the Arabian Peninsula and all the countries that make that up in the same way not necessarily walking the whole route this time because there's a lot of empty empty stretch of desert where not much goes on but but certainly hitchhiking and traveling with locals so the plan was to start up on the Turkish border with with Syria up in Rajava and the Kurdish region and basically walk travel hitchhike whatever all the way around the entire Gulf and then finish up at Lebanon in the in the historic city of Biblos which is the oldest city in the world and revisit some of these places I've been to my earlier travels including Baghdad and to create a Mosul now of course this was in the height of the war against ISIS they still weren't defeated in Syria in Iraq so it was a pretty big challenge but doing it very light footprint Like that last rep or that donut that you're like, you know, I did work out.
