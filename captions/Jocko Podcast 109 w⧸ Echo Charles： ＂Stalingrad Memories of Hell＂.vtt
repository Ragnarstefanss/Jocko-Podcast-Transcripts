00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 109 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
1 September 1942, the Army in the field.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Comrade fighters, commanders, and political workers, heroic defenders of Stalin-Grod.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The bitter fighting for the city of Stalin-Grod has been raging for months. The Germans have lost hundreds of tanks and planes.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Hitler's brutalized hordes are advancing towards Stalin-Grod and the Volga over mountains of dead bodies of their own men and officers.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Our Bolshevik party, our nation, our great country, have given us the task not to let the enemy reach the Volga to defend the city of Stalin-Grod.

7
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The defensive Stalin-Grod is of decisive importance for the whole Soviet front.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Without sparing our strength and with scorn for death, we shall defy the Germans the way to the Volga and not give up Stalin-Grod.

9
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Each one of us must bear in mind that the capture of Stalin-Grod by the Germans and their advance to the Volga will give our enemies new strength and weaken our own forces.

10
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Not one step back.

11
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The war council expects unlimited courage, tenacity, and heroism in the fight with the on-rushing enemy from all the fighters, commanders, and political workers from all the defenders of Stalin-Grod.

12
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The enemy must and will be smashed on the approaches to Stalin-Grod.

13
00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Forward against the enemy, up into the unremitting battle comrades for Stalin-Grod for our great country, death to the German invader.

14
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So that is a clearly a note from the general on the ground.

15
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The member of the war council of the Stalin-Grod and southwest front lieutenant general, Khrushchev, sent to the troops, obviously, that were preparing to defend Stalin-Grod.

16
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now, there was another commander in the field by the name of Paulus, and he sent a note to Hitler on 23 November 1942, my fear.

17
00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Since receipt of your radio message of evening 22-1-1 events have come thick and fast, we have not succeeded in closing the pocket to the southwest and west, impending enemy penetrations begin to emerge there.

18
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Ammunition in fuel are coming to an end.

19
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Numerous batteries and tanks have shot themselves dry. A timely and adequate supply is impossible. The army will shortly be destroyed unless a concentration of forces succeeds in totally defeating the enemy attacking from the south and west.

20
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:40.000
For this, we must immediately withdraw all forces from Stalin-Grod and strong detachments from the northern front. Un avoidable sequel must then be a breakout towards the southwest since eastern and northern front can no longer be held with such weak forces.

21
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In this case, we will lose much material, but the majority of the valuable combatants and at least a part of the material will be preserved.

22
00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I retain full responsibility for this message, even if I add that commanding general's heights, strecker, cube, jackmill, von sidelets all share this evaluation of the situation.

23
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Based on the situation, I again request freedom of action.

24
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I will highlight my fear, signed Paulus. The Russians were effective in surrounding the Germans. The Germans, 6th Army, is a matter of fact, 250 to 300,000 men fully surrounded by the Russians.

25
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Here's what Hitler wrote back. 6 Army has been temporarily encircled by Russian forces. I intend to concentrate the army in the area, Stalin-Grod north,

26
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Kutduban Hill 137 Hill 135, Mere Novka, Zabenko, Solid-Grad South. The army may rest assured that I will do everything to bring supplies to it accordingly and relieve it in time.

27
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I know the brave 6 Army and its commander in chief, and I am sure it will do its duty. Signed 8-Auf Hitler.

28
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So, and we'll get into this Hitler over and over again, is asked if the troops on the ground can try to escape from Stalin-Grad and over and over again, he says, no, you cannot leave, you will fight to the last bullet.

29
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And on the 30th January 1943, Herman Goring, who is the Nazi Reichs Marshall of the entire German Reichs, so he's this senior military man of the entire German army from 1940 until the end of the war.

30
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And even though Stalin-Grad had not fallen yet, he gave this speech about their sacrifice of these German soldiers.

31
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And he gave it, you know, it was obviously heard on the radio, etc. And it spread, and actually the soldiers on the ground in Stalin-Grad.

32
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The German soldiers heard this speech. And again, we'll get more to what the reactions were, but I'm going to read that part of that speech right now.

33
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It made one shutter, but Stalin had enormous masses at his disposal, and used old men, women and children, and did not bother about supplies or sufficient food or transport. The Russians used the whip or the bullet.

34
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The Germans alone could resist and could wrestle with such an adversary, everything depended on them.

35
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
With the greatest respect to other nations, the Germans are the only ones in Europe in a position to break Russia and destroy Bolshevism.

36
00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Of all the terrific battles, the battle for Stalin-Grad stood out like a gigantic monument, which would one day be regarded as the greatest and most heroic battle in German history.

37
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So he's referring to this in the past tense once again. This hasn't been, this hadn't finished yet, but he's referring to it like it's in the past tense, because for all practical purposes, it was.

38
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Back to the document, every German soldier would come to pronounce the word, Stalin-Grad, with holy awe and remember that it was there that Germany set the seal of final victory,

39
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:47.000
because people that fought like that must win. Germany has now become the guarantor of European freedom, culture and life, but for the fighters of Stalin-Grad, the Russians might have obtained their objective. Now they are too late.

40
00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The defenders of Stalin-Grad had obeyed the law, which everyone must obey the law to die for Germany. This law was not only binding on soldiers, but on the whole German nation.

41
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The nation must not question whether it's stand at Stalin-Grad has been necessary or not. The law had ordered them to do so. So here it's in, don't question,

42
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:24.000
don't question this sacrifice of 250,000 men, don't question it. It was of no concern to the German soldier whether he died at Stalin-Grad in the African desert or Norway.

43
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
He always sacrificed himself, so that his nation might live.

44
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:46.000
In hours, when some people perhaps tried to install morbid and slie thoughts into your brains, then we must always look at the fear, their shining and greatest example.

45
00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:00.000
They could believe that the Almighty had led this man a godsent man to pass through innumerable dangers and become greater and greater, all for nothing.

46
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That provenance had given them this man who had made them into the strongest nation in the world.

47
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:20.000
These are guarantees that justify our belief in victory. So we're talking about Hitler here, by the way, as a godsent man.

48
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The difficult times are really less tested and people prove their worth in hard trials. I, the commander in chief of the Lufroffta, suffered exceptionally when I heard of the results of the bombings.

49
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And although I did my best to prevent it from happening, it must be recognized as unavoidable and must not influence our will for resistance.

50
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And I know a tremendous heroic song from a match without equal that was called the Battle of the Neblones.

51
00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:04.000
They too stood in a hall of fire and fire, quenching their thirst with their own blood, but fought and fought to the last.

52
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Such a fight is raging there today, because a people who can fight like that must win.

53
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And before these men, a millennia, previous, their stood in a small, gorgeous, Greece and infinitely brave and daring man with his 300.

54
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Leonites stood with 300 Spartans from a tribe known for its bravery and boldness. And an overwhelmingly numerical superior enemy attacked and attacked again and again, even then it was a rush from the Asian east against the Nordic people.

55
00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Huge numbers of men were available to Zerxes, but the 300 men did not waver or falter fighting a losing battle, hopeless but not meaningless.

56
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And then the last man fell. And in this bottleneck, there is a sentence.

57
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Wanderer, if you come to Sparta report that you had seen us lying here as the law commanded.

58
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They were 300 men, my comrades, and millennia have passed, but today that battle that sacrifice still counts as the greatest example of heroic soldiering.

59
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And today this fight is there. The sacrifice is there in Stalingrad. And one day it will be said if you go to Germany.

60
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Tell them you have seen us lying in Stalingrad as the law commanded us to protect the security of our people.

61
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And as I said, those were the words of Herman Goring, who is the senior officer of the German military at that time.

62
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And those words were his words. And of course, his words were lies.

63
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And all of them were lies, and no one knew that better than the men on the ground in and around the Russian city of Stalingrad.

64
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Nearly 1500 miles away from Berlin, freezing, starving, surrounded, low on ammunition, lacking medical supplies, and lacking cold weather gear, and lacking any kind of real leadership.

65
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And also served in a nation that lacked the moral high ground.

66
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:06.000
As a matter of fact, their nation's leaders lacked any kind of morality at all, and this is clear in the aggression that they unleashed in the world and the atrocities that they committed mass murder of millions of people.

67
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it's clear that they had no morality whatsoever based on how they treated their own soldiers.

68
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Who, like many soldiers, were men that were fighting not for political powers or for political ideals created in an ivory tower thousands of miles away from them.

69
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But for the ideals of a soldier himself, duty and courage and honor, that's what soldiers fight for, and the ultimate thing that they fight for.

70
00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:03.000
As we have heard time and time again is for their brothers on the line with them to their left and to their right.

71
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And one of those men was named Johakeem Weater.

72
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
He was an intelligence officer in the eighth core of the German six army.

73
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And he wrote about his experiences in a book called Stalin Grad, Memories of Hell, where he recalls what he and other German soldiers went through physically mentally and spiritually.

74
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:59.000
As they were abandoned by their leaders, as they were abandoned by life, and as they were abandoned by hope itself.

75
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Let's go to the book.

76
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Again, this is Johakeem Weater.

77
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And the book is called Stalin Grad Memories of Hell.

78
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000
After meticulous preparations of gigantic proportions, the Russians with their overwhelming, superior armor and cavalry forces attacking, like lightning from the north and the following day from the east.

79
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And the press to our entire sixth army into an iron vice.

80
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Within three days, the encircling ring was closed at Colach on the Dan and on the Don and constantly reinforced.

81
00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And we stared at our situation maps on which menacing thick red lines of encirclement and arrows showed the enemy attacks, penetrations and directions of advance. We had never imagined a catastrophe of such proportions to be possible.

82
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:20.000
The mighty wedges of the Russian armored columns could not be stopped and a myriad of highly mobile cavalry troops increased the model and confusion in the rear of the bloody rent front of the army.

83
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Obviously, I skipped a little bit moving into this point, but at this point they're completely surrounded, like I said, cut off and the Russians are applying the pressure.

84
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The enemy appeared to be systematically invading our blows and to be withdrawing into the depths of Russia.

85
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So this is going, he's kind of reflecting back on how they ended up there and he says that he says the enemy appeared to be systematically invading our blows and to be withdrawing into the depths of Russia.

86
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000
This is what the Russians do. That's what they didn't Napoleon in 1812 and they're doing it again here.

87
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And he back to the book, taking as a whole, this was a master piece of general staff thinking, today I'm convinced that those withdrawals of what Russian forces during the summer of 1942 were an outstanding enactment of traditional war Russian war tactics.

88
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So Hitler got lowered in and they didn't pay attention. They didn't reflect on history. And as we all, as most people know, this was also Hitler opening another front and trying to fight on multiple fronts at the same time, which goes against a certain law of combat called prioritizing execute.

89
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And then he said, you know, you're going to have to focus your forces on your most important thing and then move on Hitler gets a F on prioritizing execute.

90
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Back to the book, it had now come to pass.

91
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
We were actually caught in a trap. How will we to get out?

92
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:10.000
This situation in the pocket, he refers to this area as the pocket. This is the pocket of Russian soldiers.

93
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:24.000
So that's by the way, that's how you end up in these situations. And the Germans absolutely believe their own propaganda that they were the best soldiers and that they were the master race and that these bullshifix couldn't fight them.

94
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:40.000
When you believe that, you think you can march right into the Stonegrunt. And take it. The wind is not going to bother you. Admittedly, an eerie memory arose within me and intensified my apprehensive unrest with each passing day.

95
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:58.000
It was the memory of several fanatical statements that Hitler had recently made in public speeches. The German soldier he said, now stood on the Volka and no power on earth could make him leave the Supreme War Lord, that's a reference to Hitler.

96
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:12.000
He's got an encodes. The Supreme War Lord had emphatically committed himself, he had prophesized and demanded that Stalin grunt be relentlessly attacked and taken.

97
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Presumptuous terms, he had even sworn before God and history never again to relinquish on this conquest, presenting it as already achieved with such an attitude as this on the part of the Supreme War Lord was giving up the Volga and retreating conceivable at all.

98
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So Hitler had painted himself into a corner with a paintbrush of arrogance and an ended up in this situation where he's saying no more never going to leave.

99
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And he does not.

100
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Back to the book, the fate of more than a quarter million human beings were decided over such a distance so that the fear of headquarters is 2000 miles, 2000 kilometers, it's like 1500 miles distant away.

101
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And they're making decisions. This is called micro management. By the way, this is called micro management. This is not decentralized command.

102
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:20.000
This is the fourth law of combat from the book called Extreme Ownership. Hitler gets an F on decentralized command. He's micro managing his troops that are 1500 miles away.

103
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:39.000
The fate of more than a quarter million human beings was decided over such a distance from there hit the repeatedly addressed orders and appeals directly to Stalin to the Stalin-Grad army, which had been removed from under the command of army group, and reassigned to the newly formed army group, Don, and then Don, D.O. and is a river.

104
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Now, everybody knew that they needed to perform a military maneuver referred to as a breakout, which means you picture your inner circle, you're surrounded by troops. You pick one part of that circle of the people that are surrounded you and you attack and you break through.

105
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:08.000
It sounds like what it is. It's a breakout. Everybody knew that they needed a breakout. They're like, hey, we're surrounded. We need fuel. We need water. We need food. We don't have any of that. We need to break out.

106
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And so, everyone was kind of prepared to do that. Back to the book. Our army still deposed about 130 combat ready tanks and about the same number of armored scout cars and other armored vehicles.

107
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:29.000
In other words, we still had a powerful motorized units available. Everywhere people were waiting for the relieving signal for the breakout.

108
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:43.000
With fluttering hearts, we followed the preparations that were taking place mainly in the western sector of the army. In anticipation of the expected operation, the order had been given to destroy all superfluous material.

109
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Everywhere damaged guns, tanks, and trucks useless communication and engineering equipment, huge amounts of clothing, files, and paper even food were being consigned to flames. So they all think that they're going to break out.

110
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:09.000
They're assuming, look, we're going to break out. This is the only solution right now. Where surrounded, we need to attack one area and get out of here. So they start going, okay, before we leave, we're going to burn this fuel, we're going to burn this food. We're not going to leave anything for the Russians.

111
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Back to the book, according to the decision by army command that retreat from Stalingrad was to begin on 26 November.

112
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.000
We did not entertain the slightest doubt that this supreme command must be convinced of its necessity. We counted firmly on its being carried out.

113
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I will never forget how stunned we all were. The agitation, yes, the petrifying horror that befell us, especially among the higher ranks of our staff, went on 24 November.

114
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:50.000
The message came in from army that Hitler had forbidden the planned breakout and finally ordered the Stalingrad army to temporarily take up a position of all around defense.

115
00:22:50.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So it was says no, you're not leaving. Oh, you're surrounded. By the way, they're surrounded by a force of about a million Russian soldiers, but but it's more than that because they're surrounded by the country of Russia.

116
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Back to the book, the fatal radio message from the distant fear headquarters had come like a stroke of lightning.

117
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
For bidding the plan with draw of our northern front, the detachment of our forces from Stalingrad and thereby the hope for the breakout.

118
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
This decision by the supreme command was just as heavy a blow for the staff at the army as it was for us.

119
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We were unable to satisfy ourselves as to why all the reports, adminsions and requests for our responsible of our responsible higher staffs who were best able to judge the events and all the dangers they entailed had not been successful.

120
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
So this is something that Paton said, the commander on the ground is always right.

121
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Meaning if you're sitting in an ivory tower somewhere, there's a guy on the ground. He's right and you're wrong.

122
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:07.000
He's on the ground. He knows what's happening. Now, could we come up with some exceptions to this? Absolutely. You have better intelligence of what's happening. You maybe know some.

123
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:17.000
You maybe have overhead coverage or you get you get air reports or you have in these days you have satellites looking at things. So yeah, there's situations where you might know a little bit more.

124
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:29.000
But the default thought process should be the guy on the ground is has a better situation awareness than I do. I'm going to go with their call. And here's Hitler saying no.

125
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Now general policy who's the commander of all the all the German soldiers.

126
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:45.000
General Paul is back to the book. General Paul is addressed himself directly to Hitler with a very serious and responsible evaluation of the situation in this momentous radio message.

127
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:59.000
He had adamantly stressed that the fact that all his senior commanding generals shared the conviction that because it would be impossible to adequately supply the army in time. It would shortly be destroyed unless a concentration of all available forces were succeeded and

128
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:15.000
to divide decisively beating the enemy attacking from the west in the south. So not just one general that saying this every but every user there's there's there's 250 300 thousand Germans there's a lot of senior military people all of them

129
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:29.000
are saying we need to leave Hitler says no. Why does Hitler's just that like no you got you guys don't leave because we're Germans we fight to the death it's arrogance.

130
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:43.000
It's absolutely partially arrogance that he thinks no will hold out. We're just going to support us. We'll just build this all out and I think he's being stubborn.

131
00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:03.000
He made a call kind of thing and then they're like hey this calls no good we're going to do this. He's going to be the call. He goes I mean we obviously Hitler hasn't probably want to dig his egos of any human being ever and he's in full effect.

132
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Even though he had left no doubt that in his view the decision promising salvation lane and immediate breakout in the end he too this talking about Paulus in the end he too submitted and obeyed

133
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:26.000
for him in order wasn't order in spite of everything. All that remained to us was to hope for rescue operation from the outside. I will say this actually

134
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:38.000
There's some books that parts of this book that I'm not going to cover because we just don't have time. There's that guy that gave that speech going to be getting he had also told Hitler.

135
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Hey, no worry we can resupply he was the before taking over all the German military forces he was in charge of the German air force the Luftwaffe.

136
00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:01.000
And he said look we can resupply these guys don't worry about it don't worry and I he probably said that at a time when it didn't look like they're going to get completely surrounded you know yeah we'll resupply don't worry about

137
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And we'll get into some of the numbers on what they said they could do but that's another reason why Hitler Hitler thought oh we can resupply he also had people on the ground he's surrounded by Yesman

138
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:24.000
So no one wants to disagree with the boss man in this case eight all Hitler by saying so when he says look can't we resupply them yes yes we can resupply him from the air and also he was saying hey can't someone instead of them

139
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Breaking out and going toward back towards Germany why don't we have some German troops go towards them and break into them that way we can open up some supply lines so when he gets told when he when he offered that solution he got told yes we can do it

140
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Yes, we can do it so he surrounded by Yesman and you know how he ended up surrounded by Yesman he's ego

141
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:54.000
I don't want I don't like to get told oh you're gonna tell me no you're fired yeah get someone in here that's gonna tell me that they can do what I'm saying and then that person's gonna get promoted and then you get surrounded by people that want to get promoted

142
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Check

143
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Proceeding on

144
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And there was one

145
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:17.000
General that really made it made a significant effort here we go back to the book initially General Von Sidelitz was dumbfounded stunned

146
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:25.000
He accepted the order but in his heart he rejected it particularly since he was painfully aware that his own were hands were tied

147
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:36.72
Not until the following day 25 November 1942 did General Von Sidelitz react to Hitler's orders and his reaction was as much filled with a sense of responsibility as it was

148
00:28:36.72 --> 00:28:47.000
Temperamental addressed the army command it took the form of a detailed evaluation of the situation that core commander had had his chief of staff prepare

149
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
It's surmised once again all the arguments against the solid army digging in and urged the breaking out of the ring immediately

150
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:08.000
So what's cool about this book they actually have this actual document this guy wrote if you ever heard me talking to podcast about getting all your ducks in a row and like hey if my boss tells me no cool

151
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I'm gonna I'm gonna get all the information I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna make a bullet proof argument

152
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.20
My boss is going to agree with because you can't my my arguments gonna be ball proof because I'm right and if I wasn't right then I wouldn't

153
00:29:21.20 --> 00:29:28.000
I wouldn't go this far right I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put my my reputation on the line

154
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.80
Arguing something that I don't truly believe is right you know all from us. Okay. Well, you know what he could be right

155
00:29:32.80 --> 00:29:38.000
So you know what I'm gonna try and execute to my best of my ability in this case sidelets is like no

156
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.70
It's not no and and he says okay, I'm gonna perform I'm gonna put together this thing they have the document inside this book

157
00:29:44.70 --> 00:29:48.60
I would read it, but it's long it's it's so detailed that it would take too much time

158
00:29:48.60 --> 00:29:53.30
But it lays out every little detail of why they need to break out and not an emotion

159
00:29:53.30 --> 00:29:55.30
That's what's beautiful about not an emotional way

160
00:29:55.30 --> 00:29:59.20
How maybe I just need to check myself because maybe more emotion was needed but

161
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.90
Generally if you come across as really emotional hit the wood think all you well a boss would think oh

162
00:30:04.90 --> 00:30:08.50
You're just emotional about the ZECO use emotional buddy you just need to calm down

163
00:30:09.50 --> 00:30:14.88
Carry out the orders so he didn't he he played the role or he he used the strategy of just calm

164
00:30:15.54 --> 00:30:22.000
This is what's going on this one needs to change or this is what we need to do and if we don't it's gonna be catastrophic

165
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Back to the book in the emergency situation

166
00:30:27.46 --> 00:30:30.20
Intensified by the okay agent okay. She's

167
00:30:30.20 --> 00:30:36.06
Oberkommando day aator, so which is the supreme high command of the German army

168
00:30:36.68 --> 00:30:43.74
General von sidelitz demanded from the commander and chief of the army that he act immediately against orders and other words against Hitler

169
00:30:43.74 --> 00:30:46.72
So so sidelitz when sidelitz got told no he's like no listen

170
00:30:46.72 --> 00:30:47.72
We need to do it anyways

171
00:30:47.96 --> 00:30:51.18
That's how passionate so now he's starting to get a little bit emotional and passionate

172
00:30:51.18 --> 00:30:55.40
He declared it to be an imperative duty to the army and to the German people to

173
00:30:55.40 --> 00:31:02.44
obey the dictates of conscience and to seize the freedom of action that had been forbidden in order to prevent threatening

174
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.80
catastrophe the memo was passed on by army command

175
00:31:06.04 --> 00:31:08.04
But had no effect whatsoever

176
00:31:10.52 --> 00:31:15.12
And so they had to suffer the additional pain that in the final analysis

177
00:31:15.12 --> 00:31:19.24
They could but give in and fulfill the bitter

178
00:31:19.24 --> 00:31:29.84
Soldiers do duty to obey against their own better insight now I will tell you that as Napoleon said if you execute a plan that you know is wrong

179
00:31:29.84 --> 00:31:33.64
You are culpable for executing it and these guys

180
00:31:34.56 --> 00:31:36.56
They would not stand up against Hitler

181
00:31:39.64 --> 00:31:44.68
Back to the book where you're all deeply disturbed and full of despair and in our hearts even outraged

182
00:31:44.68 --> 00:31:50.48
What was being demanded of us non-ly contradicted all military experience it went against every

183
00:31:50.68 --> 00:31:58.12
Soldierly feeling and robbed of us any hope of any hope of being able to save ourselves by breaking out under our own power

184
00:31:59.96 --> 00:32:06.08
In the last week of November when the formations that had been heavily damaged during the initial retreat were hastily and with

185
00:32:06.28 --> 00:32:12.30
Great difficulty establishing themselves on a new main line of resistance army issued a grave

186
00:32:12.30 --> 00:32:20.34
Order of the day I can still remember the exact wording. It started six army has been surrounded. This is not your fault

187
00:32:22.54 --> 00:32:28.74
As always you have fought bravely and tenetiously up to the moment the enemy had you by the neck

188
00:32:29.70 --> 00:32:32.90
It went on to point out that the hard fighting suffering and deprivations

189
00:32:33.06 --> 00:32:39.22
That would still be demanded of the troops and which they would have to endure for a time in hunger and frost

190
00:32:39.22 --> 00:32:46.38
Trusting in the help from outside that had been so definitely promised so Hitler did say how I'm gonna send help from the outside. Don't worry about it. You stay put

191
00:32:47.22 --> 00:32:51.62
Finally mentioned was made of the relief operation to which Hitler had personally committed himself

192
00:32:53.22 --> 00:32:58.50
Psychologically clever and calculating the appeal ended with the encouraging words promising

193
00:32:58.78 --> 00:33:03.66
Consolation and salvation hold on the fear will get you out

194
00:33:03.66 --> 00:33:13.46
This final sentence appealing so strongly to emotion which injected a new tone into the previously factual and sober language of military orders

195
00:33:13.46 --> 00:33:15.96
gave rise to discussions among our staff

196
00:33:16.86 --> 00:33:26.22
It made me realize on top of all that it already happened how great the sacrifice was going to be that would be demanded of the troops

197
00:33:30.90 --> 00:33:32.58
By the way

198
00:33:32.58 --> 00:33:34.58
These guys traveled there and

199
00:33:35.38 --> 00:33:37.38
Had a really hard time of it

200
00:33:37.94 --> 00:33:44.22
They know how hard it was for them to get there and now they're being told that the people that are gonna

201
00:33:44.50 --> 00:33:50.88
The way that they're gonna get saved is by someone else coming behind them to help them going through the same

202
00:33:51.42 --> 00:33:54.42
hardships that they barely got there so

203
00:33:55.02 --> 00:33:57.02
They're they're

204
00:33:57.42 --> 00:34:00.50
Outlook isn't good. Yeah, it's a jellish yeah, they're doubtful

205
00:34:00.50 --> 00:34:04.88
Back to the book a large number of the soldiers who had been in constant exhaustion

206
00:34:05.22 --> 00:34:12.50
Exhausting action in the front line for two years without leave without having been home to see their loved ones

207
00:34:13.22 --> 00:34:17.54
So a lot of these guys, so they had actually survived a winter early on

208
00:34:17.94 --> 00:34:24.58
They had survived a winter as they pushed into German as they put it to push to Russia and now they're waiting for another one

209
00:34:24.74 --> 00:34:28.82
But these soldiers have been fighting for two straight years hard fighting

210
00:34:28.82 --> 00:34:34.78
Back to the book naturally the troops were not in a position to appreciate the full extent of the suffering and deprivation

211
00:34:34.78 --> 00:34:40.46
They were about to face they knew nothing of the difficult problems of the overall supply situation

212
00:34:40.46 --> 00:34:46.38
So again, this guy is working at the headquarters, meaning he's you know with the commanders and the leadership

213
00:34:46.38 --> 00:34:52.66
So he's tracking all the logistics of the situation the front line soldier doesn't know the front line soldier expects how you they're gonna bring me bullets

214
00:34:52.66 --> 00:34:53.86
They're gonna bring me food

215
00:34:53.86 --> 00:34:58.62
He realizes because he sees what's actually happening that that's gonna be a real problem

216
00:35:00.42 --> 00:35:05.98
They had no inkling of the countless worries that lay so heavily and depressantly on the higher staffs

217
00:35:06.70 --> 00:35:13.80
Nor at first where they aware that that at one stroke the encirclement had made it impossible to complete

218
00:35:14.30 --> 00:35:21.78
Preparations for winter positions out there in the supply depose of the army lay tens of thousands of fur coats

219
00:35:21.78 --> 00:35:29.66
Warm stockings protective head gear and other items of winter clothing which could now no longer reach the encircled forces

220
00:35:30.06 --> 00:35:38.14
For the most part the men remained completely in adequately supplied with winter gear and exposed to the murderous frost

221
00:35:38.86 --> 00:35:41.94
So the thousands and thousands of warm weather gear

222
00:35:43.46 --> 00:35:46.46
Or I should say cold weather gear and now they're gonna get nothing

223
00:35:46.46 --> 00:35:54.06
They're cut off back the book we calculated that our own army whose total strength before the encirclement had been about

224
00:35:54.54 --> 00:35:56.78
330,000 men now numbered about

225
00:35:57.42 --> 00:36:00.22
280,000 so they're already short 50,000 killed

226
00:36:03.10 --> 00:36:08.30
We the staff the officers in the staff departments also pinned our hopes on the relief operation

227
00:36:08.30 --> 00:36:14.06
Which was being prepared no one even considered that Hitler would be ready to abandon the outstandingly proven

228
00:36:14.06 --> 00:36:19.50
Sixth Army on the Vulcan throw it to the wolves so these guys are even I said that even though I said they weren't hopeful

229
00:36:19.50 --> 00:36:22.86
They're also thinking there's no way that Hitler is gonna leave

230
00:36:24.38 --> 00:36:27.58
300,000 soldiers out here. There's no way

231
00:36:29.18 --> 00:36:33.98
Back to the book he was bound to find ways and means to rectify the devilist situation

232
00:36:34.10 --> 00:36:40.74
They're even starry eyed dreamers not however among the older and more experienced who maintain that the fur would not only get us out

233
00:36:40.74 --> 00:36:48.02
But it probably already conceived a plan to turn our apparent defeat into a glorious triumph by encircling all the enemies armies that are surrounding us

234
00:36:51.30 --> 00:36:58.50
None of these dreamers and believers and miracles who kept their who kept servicing here and there until the very end had a clear idea of what was implied

235
00:36:58.50 --> 00:37:06.78
By the fact that German soldiers were simultaneously fighting on the north Cape and the bay of disgue in the front of Leningrad and viewers

236
00:37:06.78 --> 00:37:10.46
on in the caucus in Crete and in North Africa

237
00:37:11.66 --> 00:37:14.66
So again, disguise fighting fronts all over the place and

238
00:37:17.26 --> 00:37:25.74
The and the staff officers the leadership knew how thinly spread the German army was the front line troops in you know

239
00:37:25.74 --> 00:37:27.74
They didn't make sense of that

240
00:37:28.94 --> 00:37:33.98
During the weeks of December the fighting strength the army was deteriorating at a horrendous pace

241
00:37:33.98 --> 00:37:38.46
The blame for this lay mainly in the in the inadequate air lift

242
00:37:39.46 --> 00:37:47.66
Here a catastrophic picture was slowly emerging in order to be able to maintain its ability to live and fight our army had initially

243
00:37:47.78 --> 00:37:48.38
requested

244
00:37:48.38 --> 00:37:51.38
750 tons of supplies per day

245
00:37:53.70 --> 00:37:56.10
Later reducing this to 500 tons per day

246
00:37:57.22 --> 00:38:02.62
the J.U. 52 cargo aircraft had about a two ton load the

247
00:38:02.62 --> 00:38:09.70
Want the HE111 fighter bomber had held about 1.5 tons

248
00:38:10.62 --> 00:38:13.34
So this is gonna require like

249
00:38:14.26 --> 00:38:17.34
2000 aircraft to be able to make this happen

250
00:38:18.58 --> 00:38:26.70
What are they end up with back the book they only brought in 80 to 120 tons of the required supplies in other words

251
00:38:26.70 --> 00:38:29.10
Not more than one fifth of the amount needed

252
00:38:29.10 --> 00:38:36.66
Purely and simply this meant a daily deficit of 10,000 kilograms of bread and a fatal

253
00:38:36.66 --> 00:38:40.58
Under supply of desperately needed fuel and ammunition

254
00:38:41.38 --> 00:38:43.38
So you're gonna one fifth of what they need now

255
00:38:44.38 --> 00:38:47.58
We have to be careful because that's a little statistic that we're thrown out there

256
00:38:48.22 --> 00:38:50.94
Right like oh we're getting one fifth of what we need

257
00:38:50.94 --> 00:38:57.94
But I'll think of a human being in what you need as a human being just food and you cut that down to one fifth of what you need

258
00:38:57.94 --> 00:39:01.74
You know you need 2,500 calories a day you're gonna get 500

259
00:39:03.14 --> 00:39:10.42
That's what we're talking about yeah, you need and by the way you're fighting and you're gonna you're being attacked so you need

260
00:39:12.10 --> 00:39:14.10
1000 bullets a day

261
00:39:14.22 --> 00:39:17.74
Right you need a thousand bullets a day you're getting 120 bullets

262
00:39:18.66 --> 00:39:22.50
It's it's their things are not looking good

263
00:39:22.50 --> 00:39:24.50
But

264
00:39:26.54 --> 00:39:32.66
Back to the book the sunset soon after lunch and by 1,400 to 1,500 hours

265
00:39:32.66 --> 00:39:38.38
It was already dark so this is now we're talking Russian winter by 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon. It's dark

266
00:39:40.50 --> 00:39:46.26
And every day this two reminded us to supp depressing the here in the desolation of the snow brump

267
00:39:46.26 --> 00:39:50.02
Snowbound step of the enormous distance that separated us from home

268
00:39:50.02 --> 00:39:58.78
Where we not all the living and the dead long buried in a gigantic mass grave

269
00:39:59.86 --> 00:40:04.14
Faults like this occasionally befell me when I return from various sectors of the front

270
00:40:04.42 --> 00:40:10.86
Where in my role as liaison officer I had been sent on specific assignments to gather urgently needed information

271
00:40:12.30 --> 00:40:16.78
There on the heights above the the infamous Rochaka Valley

272
00:40:16.78 --> 00:40:28.38
The men of our divisions lay in desperate battle demanding bloody sacrifice there in the trenches and foxholes and the snow the soldiers were dying of exhaustion and cold

273
00:40:29.26 --> 00:40:33.34
Because they're steadily shrinking rations of bread and other food issued

274
00:40:33.78 --> 00:40:40.82
Food issued were no longer sufficient to provide the physical stamina needed to combat frost and sickness

275
00:40:40.82 --> 00:40:50.46
So they're starving to death. They're starving death in the freezing death and they're they're being attacked and killed by the Russians with no ammo with no ammo

276
00:40:52.66 --> 00:40:54.66
One day in the second week of December

277
00:40:55.30 --> 00:41:04.02
The staff's first heard the news that the army group Don under field marshal van mainstein von Mainstein had begun the long hope

278
00:41:04.50 --> 00:41:07.34
Relief for the long hope for relief operation

279
00:41:07.34 --> 00:41:13.18
Soon the good news that also reached the troops the words gave new impetus everywhere

280
00:41:13.18 --> 00:41:19.38
Particularly on the hard pressed western perimeter of the pocket spread like lightning mains that manstein is coming

281
00:41:20.34 --> 00:41:24.90
The already dying hopes burst further new new courage

282
00:41:25.14 --> 00:41:32.74
Happy expectations a new spirit of initiative began to blossom the sufferings and sacrifices to date had not been in vain after all

283
00:41:32.74 --> 00:41:37.90
Salvation was now back ining what the fear had promised he was bound to deliver

284
00:41:38.74 --> 00:41:41.24
So they get word bandstimes coming

285
00:41:42.62 --> 00:41:51.18
This is this this is good if everything went well they thought the hour of all relief could just coincide with Christmas

286
00:41:54.34 --> 00:41:59.74
The motorized groups and strong tank units being led by Colonel General Hoff

287
00:41:59.74 --> 00:42:05.000
Elements of which had been brought in from France and great haste had begun their relief offensive

288
00:42:05.34 --> 00:42:08.70
Hoff spearhead tanks were only 50 kilometers away

289
00:42:09.34 --> 00:42:11.34
Hold on we're coming

290
00:42:11.90 --> 00:42:20.26
Said one of the encouraging radio messages which spread like wire fire amongst the western edge of the pocket so they're in radio communication 50 kilometers and

291
00:42:21.70 --> 00:42:24.90
And this well respected

292
00:42:24.90 --> 00:42:29.94
Leader Hoff he's on the way any time hold on we're coming

293
00:42:31.18 --> 00:42:34.82
Do you ever that isn't that like a jinx right there?

294
00:42:34.94 --> 00:42:40.98
You know what I mean like do you ever celebrate something you've been inside your head you celebrate something a little bit before you should

295
00:42:41.26 --> 00:42:48.02
Don't ever do that am I super stitious cuz I believe that way if you think that that's how it truly works

296
00:42:48.82 --> 00:42:52.78
But I think I think it's super stitious

297
00:42:52.78 --> 00:42:56.50
But I also think there's some psychology behind yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

298
00:42:56.50 --> 00:43:00.82
Yeah, we're especially if you realize if you just realize oh, I just celebrated early right there

299
00:43:00.82 --> 00:43:04.50
So it's gonna make you uneasy there's something like a I feel like that guy

300
00:43:05.26 --> 00:43:09.34
That guy got a certain level of satisfaction just by saying like don't worry

301
00:43:09.34 --> 00:43:17.66
We're coming like he had this moment of glory. That's glorious. They'd be able to say yeah, don't worry. We're coming. Yeah, it's a glorious thing to be able to say

302
00:43:19.30 --> 00:43:20.30
any

303
00:43:20.30 --> 00:43:21.30
took that

304
00:43:21.30 --> 00:43:23.70
He took the easy money right there

305
00:43:24.38 --> 00:43:27.74
Psychologically instead of being like hey, we're not there yet when you'd be ready

306
00:43:27.74 --> 00:43:31.54
Right, right, I don't know if you know what we're talking about where we are yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

307
00:43:31.74 --> 00:43:35.66
Finished strong right kind of thing. It's like the guy who's running the touchdown right

308
00:43:35.66 --> 00:43:40.50
He's right you celebrate it's the 30 yard line right the 25 we put the hand out. Who was that?

309
00:43:40.50 --> 00:43:41.62
There's like a classic

310
00:43:41.62 --> 00:43:45.38
And the guy creeps up behind them. Hey, you know what this guy was name Leon

311
00:43:45.38 --> 00:43:50.62
Let he played for the I want to say Dallas Cowboys he was like a

312
00:43:52.26 --> 00:43:56.66
Like a deep around the way of year I want to say 90s me

313
00:43:56.66 --> 00:44:00.70
How many other Dallas Cowboys players can you remember the name up from the 90s?

314
00:44:01.94 --> 00:44:05.80
Can you remember a lot of them? Like a handful just let the quarter Leo

315
00:44:05.80 --> 00:44:12.18
Remember him he's he's infamous. It's like for this I mean for a guy, you know, he's a defensive like line man or something

316
00:44:12.18 --> 00:44:18.86
Recoveres a firm will runs it in for the touchdown and he's he's doing he's not even doing putting the above his head

317
00:44:18.86 --> 00:44:20.78
He's putting it on the side kind of like celebrating

318
00:44:21.06 --> 00:44:26.34
It's home and I think they stripped them and recovered it. I think if I'm not mistaken

319
00:44:26.34 --> 00:44:32.22
Yeah, I was psychologically you can't stop you got a finished strong easy money. You got to finish sprint through the finish

320
00:44:32.22 --> 00:44:36.86
Like or that like races like a hundred meter dash, you know the guys like or the 200 meter

321
00:44:36.86 --> 00:44:40.70
And he's like yeah, I want it. I know the real hungry guy gets it

322
00:44:40.70 --> 00:44:45.34
You know right there. So that's half half takes the easy money. Tang can be doing it off

323
00:44:45.74 --> 00:44:50.26
Back to the book in the sure knowledge that before us was the last chance for our salvation

324
00:44:50.26 --> 00:44:53.82
We feverously awaited the decisive hour with a feeling of confidence

325
00:44:54.46 --> 00:44:57.46
The orders we expected could not be delayed much longer

326
00:44:59.26 --> 00:45:02.62
But all too soon our hopes would be bitterly disappointed

327
00:45:02.78 --> 00:45:10.10
Alarming messages began to came in rapidly attacking Russian tank forces were embroiling the relieving army and heavy fighting

328
00:45:10.10 --> 00:45:20.94
We're slowing the advance and finally leading in connection with the Russian offensive group operations west of the dawn to a serious crisis for the entire army group

329
00:45:22.54 --> 00:45:27.46
One of the attacks hit Colonel General Hoff who is hastening towards us in

330
00:45:28.22 --> 00:45:31.02
fearful tension and delay mounting an agitation

331
00:45:31.02 --> 00:45:37.58
We read the messages we were receiving from the far distant German air reconnaissance and radio surveillance units

332
00:45:37.58 --> 00:45:39.58
Soon these brought news of disaster

333
00:45:41.30 --> 00:45:49.74
The relief operation had began to run down Hoffs forces in turn threatened with being surrounded were finally forced to retreat

334
00:45:51.02 --> 00:45:58.74
The front fell back hundreds of kilometers and the encircled Stalin-Grad army on the Volga was left to its fate

335
00:45:58.74 --> 00:46:08.94
Only much later was I to learn of tragic details of the events and circumstances that had sealed the fate of the encircled army at this point

336
00:46:08.94 --> 00:46:14.82
I did not know then that Hitler was still in no way prepared to give up Stalin-Grad in the Volga

337
00:46:15.30 --> 00:46:17.30
that for the second time and

338
00:46:17.54 --> 00:46:23.84
After the dramatic conflicts and the conflicts that he's talking about is between him between Hitler and the people of the his advisors

339
00:46:23.84 --> 00:46:33.34
He had explicitly forbidden the breakout of the six army against the will of his chief of staff and an opposition to the demands of the army group done

340
00:46:37.52 --> 00:46:42.36
So Hitler leaves them abends them

341
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:46.60
Back to the book among the circle of our closer comrades

342
00:46:46.60 --> 00:46:53.36
We no longer entertained any illusions about the bleakness of our situation the German front had with drawn a great distance away

343
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:59.52
And for the time being there would be no new thought a new thought of a new relief operation

344
00:47:01.40 --> 00:47:06.24
Would the German front be able to hold out for several more weeks?

345
00:47:06.96 --> 00:47:08.96
It was hardly to be expected

346
00:47:09.76 --> 00:47:10.56
hunger

347
00:47:10.56 --> 00:47:15.16
Frost and sickness were cutting terribly into its waning strength and

348
00:47:15.16 --> 00:47:22.80
Death was reaping an an uncanny harvest and not only on the fire spewing iron ring around the pocket

349
00:47:23.80 --> 00:47:28.64
And even the conditions for a great saving breakout operation scarcely existed any longer

350
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:35.92
In such an event the army would only be able to remain a mobile for a few kilometers because of the lack of fuel

351
00:47:35.92 --> 00:47:44.68
And if Stalin gruddled were to be given up what then would happen to the growing army of wounded sick and exhausted men?

352
00:47:45.40 --> 00:47:47.40
Did the okay age

353
00:47:47.40 --> 00:47:49.68
Intent to give up the vulga at all?

354
00:47:50.56 --> 00:47:55.44
The measures ordered so far seemed to point the opposite way once again

355
00:47:55.44 --> 00:48:04.60
I was often forced to recall Hitler's fanatical war words about the German soldier on the vulga about Stalin grudd and each time

356
00:48:04.60 --> 00:48:07.56
An icy unease crept through my bones

357
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:16.08
Maybe yes, maybe we were supposed to hold on to the bitter end to stay put and fight to the last bullet

358
00:48:17.52 --> 00:48:22.92
On the dark horizon the outlines of a terrible disaster began to emerge

359
00:48:26.16 --> 00:48:28.16
Christmas Eve approached

360
00:48:28.16 --> 00:48:35.16
All the visible and invisible wounds which the cruel events had caused burned even more painfully on this night

361
00:48:35.16 --> 00:48:46.68
The atmosphere was depressed memories of former Christmas celebrations with their blissful shimmer only dimly illuminated our harsh reality as from a world-born gone

362
00:48:46.68 --> 00:48:58.64
The well-loved Christmas carols sounded in low melancholy sadness so

363
00:48:59.64 --> 00:49:04.24
Hope is pretty much vanquished at this point not completely because he's still in May

364
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:10.84
He's still saying maybe maybe they're just gonna leave us here and fight to the last man which is a crazy thought because I'm gonna say this number again

365
00:49:11.84 --> 00:49:14.84
250 to 300,000 soldiers

366
00:49:14.84 --> 00:49:20.000
Hmm, this isn't like hey you've got 18 guys fight to last man. It's the Alamo, right?

367
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
This isn't that

368
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
This is because that

369
00:49:24.16 --> 00:49:32.40
That might have you know that that's not gonna have a strategic impact on the situation you lose 300,000

370
00:49:33.48 --> 00:49:39.64
Combat veterans which which you know hard combat hardened veterans this is gonna have a strategic implication

371
00:49:39.64 --> 00:49:42.64
I mean of course every soldier

372
00:49:42.64 --> 00:49:45.64
That dies is is a

373
00:49:46.32 --> 00:49:51.24
Epic event in that soldier's life obviously and their family and everything else

374
00:49:53.16 --> 00:49:55.92
But when you start talking about leaving

375
00:49:57.16 --> 00:50:00.16
300,000 people to die for nothing

376
00:50:01.36 --> 00:50:07.92
It's he still can't quite get that he's still not quite there. He sees it on the horizon. He's not quite there though

377
00:50:07.92 --> 00:50:11.44
Back to the book the new year had arrived

378
00:50:13.80 --> 00:50:19.08
Jangling frost lay over Stalin brought over the Stalin-Drog pocket and breathe its icy deadly breath

379
00:50:19.84 --> 00:50:27.56
The sharp wind blew through the joints of doors and windows and in the bunkers and from the floors the cold crept up to one's knees

380
00:50:28.44 --> 00:50:34.76
The daily casualty reports from our divisions that increasingly reported losses other than by enemy action

381
00:50:34.76 --> 00:50:37.44
Represented a shattering balance on the death sheet

382
00:50:38.84 --> 00:50:44.48
So what he's saying there is like yeah people are dying from combat, but even more people are dying just from cold and starvation

383
00:50:45.92 --> 00:50:48.08
Again the Russians furiously attacked

384
00:50:48.92 --> 00:50:54.28
Several sectors of our perimeter what did we have left to oppose these powerful Russian elite troops

385
00:50:54.28 --> 00:51:00.88
Who were protected from the frost and had a full stomach not to mention their numerous tanks guns rocket launchers and mortars

386
00:51:00.88 --> 00:51:05.88
Only small numbers of heavy weapons with insufficient strictly rationed ammunition

387
00:51:06.96 --> 00:51:08.96
It's all we had

388
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:11.44
Only a machiated men

389
00:51:11.44 --> 00:51:19.64
Exhausted by hunger among whom the fighting the cold and spreading diseases were taking of daily frightening toll

390
00:51:21.72 --> 00:51:24.08
How much longer could the perimeter withstand the pressure?

391
00:51:24.08 --> 00:51:31.04
It did not escape our attention that the Russians appeared to be concentrating in front of our sector and preparation for a major blow

392
00:51:31.88 --> 00:51:39.80
The last saw sad possibility grew even clearer on the dark horizon the fate of our destruction by a shattering offensive

393
00:51:40.40 --> 00:51:42.40
breaking over our heads

394
00:51:46.32 --> 00:51:50.76
So again, it's interesting that this guy's well two things I should point out number one

395
00:51:50.76 --> 00:51:57.36
It's interesting that this guy's perspective because he's in the staff and so he sees more of what's happening from the general officers

396
00:51:57.88 --> 00:52:04.28
But let's also make note that he's not in the front lines and he's so he has it relatively good

397
00:52:04.92 --> 00:52:05.92
meaning

398
00:52:05.92 --> 00:52:10.52
these protected by the by the rush from the Russians by some distance. I mean he's still getting more to

399
00:52:11.28 --> 00:52:13.04
etc. So getting artillery

400
00:52:13.04 --> 00:52:20.04
But he's not he's not I with the Russians like the guys like the soldiers on the front lines that are sitting in a little slit trench in the ground

401
00:52:20.04 --> 00:52:22.04
in the tundra

402
00:52:22.80 --> 00:52:28.64
One of the things that he sees is a meeting here. We go back to the book an important meeting of the general staff took place at our core

403
00:52:28.80 --> 00:52:34.76
Which the commander in chief of the army general Paul is attended with his chief of staff the serious reserved

404
00:52:34.88 --> 00:52:40.76
Expression of the tall figure with the head of a scientist reflected something of a burden of responsibility that press down

405
00:52:41.20 --> 00:52:43.70
Tormentingly on the shoulders of this man

406
00:52:43.70 --> 00:52:50.94
Who is the last time I was to see our army commander in the pocket as far as I can remember he never visited our core again

407
00:52:53.42 --> 00:53:03.02
I soon learned of the outcome of the meeting and the grave words of our general staff officers left no doubt about the consequences of the orders that had been issued in the meantime

408
00:53:03.02 --> 00:53:12.44
They dealt with the mobilization of the last reserves of the sixth army the encircled forces would a hold on and fight to the last

409
00:53:14.06 --> 00:53:18.98
For this purpose the formation of fortress battalions was to be prepared and executed as quickly as possible

410
00:53:18.98 --> 00:53:27.38
All remaining reserves of able-bodied men were to be collected and used as infantry members of the Luftwaffe ground personnel and anti-aircraft

411
00:53:27.38 --> 00:53:38.18
Troops gunners who no longer had guns, pans or grenadiers, engineers, truck drivers, clerical staffs, re-election law and supply personnel or once again to be ruthlessly combed out

412
00:53:39.26 --> 00:53:45.14
The order amounted to the virtual dissolution of the re-election law services and clearly demonstrated that the

413
00:53:45.14 --> 00:53:51.70
Emovalized army was doomed to stay put and fight to the last man and the last bullet

414
00:53:52.58 --> 00:53:54.58
So there you go

415
00:53:54.58 --> 00:54:00.10
Everyone's gonna fight cooks supply people you're all gonna be coming for treatment now

416
00:54:00.10 --> 00:54:07.86
And this clearly indicates to a to a weater that that means they're not going anywhere and they're gonna stay there and they're gonna fight the last man

417
00:54:10.46 --> 00:54:13.86
Back to the book we felt that we had already been written off by the higher-ups

418
00:54:14.74 --> 00:54:21.90
And all that remained for us was to perform a heroic a futile gesture to ensure the fulfillment of a the historic mission

419
00:54:21.90 --> 00:54:26.14
And he's got quotes around that of the army of stalling rat on the vulga

420
00:54:26.94 --> 00:54:34.10
The troops were again given the cheering radio message which the fewer and supreme war lord had sent at the turn of the year

421
00:54:34.42 --> 00:54:38.06
Six army has my promise that everything is being done to get it out

422
00:54:39.46 --> 00:54:42.42
But we now view this not just without

423
00:54:43.34 --> 00:54:45.34
But as downright deception

424
00:54:46.34 --> 00:54:48.34
So I don't believe it, learn anymore

425
00:54:48.34 --> 00:54:55.86
They used to just doubt him now now they think he's deceiving him and again this is not there's no small group people

426
00:54:58.86 --> 00:55:03.06
Back to the book the bread ration was reduced to 50 grams per day

427
00:55:04.02 --> 00:55:07.54
ringing cold knowing hunger creeping illness enemy fire

428
00:55:08.26 --> 00:55:09.62
combined

429
00:55:09.62 --> 00:55:12.58
in an indesoluble offensive pact

430
00:55:12.58 --> 00:55:20.42
Disentery and typhoid fever had appeared as uncanny guests and the plague of life increased from day to day

431
00:55:21.94 --> 00:55:28.74
Death danced as murder as a wrong no back and forth throughout the pocket his head quarters were the numerous places of suffering

432
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:33.94
Disparer the dressing stations and field hospitals that filled to overflowing alarmingly

433
00:55:33.94 --> 00:55:38.34
But he also felt at home on the lines day and night so death is everywhere

434
00:55:38.34 --> 00:55:43.70
And isn't weird you know you think like just being sick you would tell me you were sick a couple days ago

435
00:55:44.26 --> 00:55:46.66
common cool but yeah, and you think about

436
00:55:47.94 --> 00:55:54.14
What being sick does to you and now this is your being sick and it doesn't matter like there's no mercy

437
00:55:54.54 --> 00:55:56.54
Yeah, you're there's no mercy

438
00:55:57.18 --> 00:56:02.50
Back to the back during back the book during 50 days that pocket battle lasted so far

439
00:56:02.50 --> 00:56:07.54
He and he's talking about death he had already cleaned out horribly among the men of the army

440
00:56:08.02 --> 00:56:11.14
About one third of its manpower was gone

441
00:56:11.74 --> 00:56:18.82
Of the more than 300,000 men who were present at the time of the Russian breakthrough about 200,000 were probably still alive

442
00:56:18.82 --> 00:56:29.06
And how many of these enduring and hoping fighting and suffering human beings had death not already marked on his own?

443
00:56:33.54 --> 00:56:38.50
News that we could no longer count on any relief before spring was really shattering

444
00:56:38.58 --> 00:56:43.82
There was nothing more to be done saved a hang on and endure the horror

445
00:56:43.82 --> 00:56:50.70
Now we get a little opportunity here

446
00:56:51.74 --> 00:56:58.62
Here we go there was a surrender proposal sent to our encircled army by the Soviet Supreme Command

447
00:56:58.62 --> 00:57:06.46
The document was addressed to Paulus who had been promoted to Colonel General and to all the officers and men of the German forces fighting its dollar and Rod

448
00:57:06.46 --> 00:57:08.22
It was signed by

449
00:57:08.22 --> 00:57:10.22
Colonel General of the artillery

450
00:57:10.22 --> 00:57:17.90
We've worn Varonov and by the commander and chief of the forces of the Don front

451
00:57:18.62 --> 00:57:21.42
Lieutenant General Rokus Vinsky

452
00:57:22.70 --> 00:57:27.98
Who had now obviously been put in so charge of all the forces surrounding us

453
00:57:28.94 --> 00:57:34.38
The proposal began with a short factual and largely correct evaluation of our situation

454
00:57:34.38 --> 00:57:39.42
In particular it stressed the catastrophic state of supply of our troops who were suffering from hunger

455
00:57:39.42 --> 00:57:44.78
Cold and sickness lack of winter clothing and terribly insanity conditions

456
00:57:45.50 --> 00:57:49.74
Realistic possibilities of breaking the encircling ring no longer existed

457
00:57:50.62 --> 00:57:54.30
Any further resistance and such a hopeless situation had to be senseless

458
00:57:54.62 --> 00:58:01.58
Therefore in order to avoid further unnecessary shedding of blood the red army was proposing a number of terms

459
00:58:02.78 --> 00:58:07.10
The document ended with a reference directed to the commander and chief of Stalin-Grad army

460
00:58:07.10 --> 00:58:15.02
Pointing out that in the event of refusal the forces of the red army and air force would be obliged to destroy the pocket for which he

461
00:58:15.26 --> 00:58:18.78
Colonel General Paulus would bear the responsibility

462
00:58:21.02 --> 00:58:25.02
There's still got 200,000 people and

463
00:58:26.78 --> 00:58:29.74
You get an offer you get 24 hours to

464
00:58:31.42 --> 00:58:33.42
Respond

465
00:58:33.42 --> 00:58:35.42
Basically surrender everybody

466
00:58:35.42 --> 00:58:38.06
Yeah, everybody's gonna surrender yeah and and

467
00:58:39.02 --> 00:58:43.34
They weren't sure how they were gonna get treated. I mean they were fairly confident wasn't be treated good

468
00:58:46.94 --> 00:58:49.34
I don't know though man it's all the disinterior

469
00:58:49.34 --> 00:58:52.30
That's not treated very good either. That's not treating you very good at all

470
00:58:55.18 --> 00:59:01.34
Back to the book we soon received various orders directives and messages whose burden was that the surrender

471
00:59:02.46 --> 00:59:04.46
Was out of the question

472
00:59:04.46 --> 00:59:10.70
The commander and chief had passed the Russian ultimatum onto the fear of headquarters and asked for freedom of action for all of

473
00:59:10.94 --> 00:59:15.26
Enjualities in immediate reply hit the red personally for bidon surrender

474
00:59:16.30 --> 00:59:19.18
And Paulus had rejected in writing the proposal the

475
00:59:20.06 --> 00:59:22.06
Soviet command

476
00:59:22.86 --> 00:59:24.86
The troops were not informed

477
00:59:24.86 --> 00:59:31.18
Not to be informed in detail, but from now on they were ordered to fire without warning on flags of truth

478
00:59:31.18 --> 00:59:36.46
Of truth appearing near the front lines this instruction from army

479
00:59:36.70 --> 00:59:40.94
Which we received by radio was especially revealing as to the intentions of leadership

480
00:59:42.14 --> 00:59:47.26
In our staff it was received with rejection and objection because it was a clear breach of international law

481
00:59:47.26 --> 00:59:50.06
So they don't get told like hey we're not surrounding what they get told is

482
00:59:51.50 --> 00:59:57.18
If you see anyone with flags of truth shoot them immediately which is basically saying we're not surrendering

483
00:59:57.18 --> 01:00:06.46
Back to the book I was reminded again of Hitler's high-sounding words about the invincibility of the German soldier for whom nothing must be seen to be impossible

484
01:00:06.78 --> 01:00:14.14
The very thought of capitulation must be an irreconcilable must be irreconcilable with the prestige of the supreme warlord

485
01:00:14.14 --> 01:00:17.66
He puts that in quotes every time I don't call it out every time but he does

486
01:00:19.18 --> 01:00:25.82
He's sort of mocking Hitler with that in his speech and Munich shortly before our encirclement he had

487
01:00:25.82 --> 01:00:35.18
Had he not solemnly sworn you may rest assured I repeat this with full responsibility before God and history that we shall never again leave

488
01:00:35.18 --> 01:00:37.18
Stalin-Grad never again

489
01:00:38.30 --> 01:00:42.54
For life or death we were committed to the cheerless don step

490
01:00:43.82 --> 01:00:46.30
Here our fate must come falter

491
01:00:47.10 --> 01:00:52.22
The most terrible weeks were still before us and during those icy days in January the fearful

492
01:00:52.22 --> 01:00:55.82
Premonition of what was to come descended upon us like a lead weight

493
01:00:57.74 --> 01:01:03.34
On the morning of 10 January 1943 exactly 24 hours after the ultimatum had expired

494
01:01:04.14 --> 01:01:09.98
The Russian began the destruction of the pocket with the hellish artillery barrage

495
01:01:11.26 --> 01:01:17.42
It was the answer to the rejection of the surrender proposal up up front among the staff

496
01:01:17.42 --> 01:01:25.50
On the line I again entered the atmosphere of tension excitement nervousness and despair the situation was partially unclear and confused the

497
01:01:25.50 --> 01:01:29.66
Caterphe the catastrophe did indeed appear to be unavoidable

498
01:01:31.10 --> 01:01:40.86
Into this helpless situation orders from army came in time and time again defend hold clear up the situation fight to the last bullet

499
01:01:40.86 --> 01:01:48.86
From their desks 2000 kilometers away and he puts in parentheses and exclamation point

500
01:01:49.90 --> 01:01:51.90
the okay age

501
01:01:52.06 --> 01:02:02.78
Together with the constantly interfering fear her fear or headquarters for bade any independent withdrawal from endangered from endangered sectors of the perimeter

502
01:02:02.78 --> 01:02:12.94
And army which had to meticulously justify itself for any change in the front line caused by the pressure of circumstances obeyed

503
01:02:13.10 --> 01:02:21.18
So this classic it's micro management not decentralized command. They're even saying look if you're if your perimeter is gonna collapse don't fall back just die

504
01:02:21.18 --> 01:02:31.50
Which is ridiculous because it doesn't help the situation because now there's a hole and now more more enemy are gonna come through the hole and we're gonna have people behind us

505
01:02:32.62 --> 01:02:37.42
It's like full on kind of what you're talking about last week maybe before last week

506
01:02:37.58 --> 01:02:42.86
It's like do it because I said so kind of think like this no really he is gonna die. There's no reason to do it no strategic reason

507
01:02:42.86 --> 01:02:44.86
No tactical reason obviously

508
01:02:44.86 --> 01:02:51.50
Let's do it because I said so die whatever. Yeah, the army core

509
01:02:52.38 --> 01:03:00.06
Divisions and regiments obeyed often with bitter criticism with open or hidden reservations flaring up or knuckling under

510
01:03:00.86 --> 01:03:02.86
but they obeyed

511
01:03:03.10 --> 01:03:09.02
And the suffering and dying of troops in the trenches and foxholes in the icy step-o-bade

512
01:03:09.02 --> 01:03:16.62
Giving their all in the natural fulfillment of their duty or an apathy and silent despair

513
01:03:18.70 --> 01:03:21.42
The higher leadership did not stand with recognition

514
01:03:22.30 --> 01:03:28.54
Promotions decorations and metals rain down on mass on the fighting suffering doomed men

515
01:03:29.98 --> 01:03:35.74
But what purpose did this huge monstrous commitment and dedication of human being serve

516
01:03:35.74 --> 01:03:43.02
in the face of the increasingly health military helplessness and the daily worsening human

517
01:03:43.02 --> 01:03:51.82
Plight I was becoming more and more depressed by the torturing question of the why of this sacrifice of most precious blood this

518
01:03:51.82 --> 01:03:53.82
Pitalist dying

519
01:03:54.86 --> 01:03:59.90
Was it not only for the sake of of a prestige that a military supreme command

520
01:03:59.90 --> 01:04:10.14
Thousands of kilometers removed mercilessly wish to maintain then for whom the price in many thousands of human lives did not appear to be too high

521
01:04:12.06 --> 01:04:17.82
This question haunted me and would not leave me until the final sorrowful ending

522
01:04:21.34 --> 01:04:23.34
So he's asking why

523
01:04:23.34 --> 01:04:32.86
They start to collapse from the perimeter of the pocket in towards the city of Stalingrad

524
01:04:33.98 --> 01:04:38.38
Because they were kind of pushed out around it surrounding it and now they're starting to fall back to it

525
01:04:38.38 --> 01:04:45.98
Where they at least have some coverage back to the book the withdrawal of the troops finally turned into a full-fledged flight into which further

526
01:04:45.98 --> 01:04:49.10
Formations and combat groups of various divisions were drawn

527
01:04:49.10 --> 01:05:01.26
Whole units cease to exist in this confusion in the sector of our neighbor to our left this fate also put an end to a whole division

528
01:05:02.22 --> 01:05:07.42
That had long been under our command and in the end had burned out like a slag heap

529
01:05:07.42 --> 01:05:19.02
I saw its distraught general now a commander without troops wandering around in a bunker desperately seeking a new assignment

530
01:05:21.74 --> 01:05:26.62
So he just lost 20,000 men he's walking around saying one of my supposed to do now

531
01:05:27.66 --> 01:05:34.06
Back to the book and this desperate withdrawal was being carried out in icy cold weather and

532
01:05:34.06 --> 01:05:38.70
Piddlest snowstorms at 30 degrees sent to grade below zero

533
01:05:39.74 --> 01:05:41.74
That's negative 22

534
01:05:46.38 --> 01:05:53.50
At 30 degrees below zero the remnant of the regiments that had shrunk to combat groups and the suffering

535
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:59.42
Hards of their shadow of other shattered units moved over the empty white steps staggering crowds

536
01:05:59.42 --> 01:06:05.34
Dragging stracking crowds of lost lightly wounded and frostbitten soldiers with them

537
01:06:06.46 --> 01:06:15.90
How many of those that so far had been spared enemy fire succumbed there to exhaustion and over exertion to the strains of hunger and to the cold

538
01:06:16.86 --> 01:06:23.42
Inumerable men fell by the wayside and were soon mercifully covered over by the snow

539
01:06:23.42 --> 01:06:27.82
And this was no longer an authorized withdrawal

540
01:06:28.70 --> 01:06:35.90
The recoil of the front was now taking place despite standing orders to hold and maintain position at all costs and

541
01:06:36.06 --> 01:06:39.74
Despite the line of resistance laid down by the okay age

542
01:06:40.86 --> 01:06:43.90
So they finally did break and they finally said you know what

543
01:06:45.02 --> 01:06:49.74
Survival this is about survival and we're not staying here anymore. We're gonna try and get back

544
01:06:51.02 --> 01:06:53.02
Fall back

545
01:06:53.02 --> 01:06:57.66
The psychological ability of the troops to resist had now also been eroded

546
01:06:58.94 --> 01:07:02.70
There could no longer be any doubt about our fate

547
01:07:04.14 --> 01:07:08.86
After the enemy had begun as decisive attack bent on destruction and our

548
01:07:08.94 --> 01:07:14.94
Disillusion was in full progress. It was too late for a last departure attempt to break out to the west

549
01:07:16.06 --> 01:07:21.42
Help from outside could no longer be considered more devastating even than the enemies weapons

550
01:07:21.42 --> 01:07:29.66
Where hunger exhaustion cold and illness of all kinds among the soldiers who had not been adequately fed for so many long weeks

551
01:07:30.46 --> 01:07:36.70
With the advent of the incredible indescribable strains of daily retreats the situation had deteriorated

552
01:07:37.34 --> 01:07:38.86
catastrophically

553
01:07:38.86 --> 01:07:42.38
We were lacking in food weapons rest warmth

554
01:07:43.42 --> 01:07:44.70
hope

555
01:07:44.70 --> 01:07:48.62
In short, we were lacking in all the vital conditions for fighting

556
01:07:48.62 --> 01:07:55.18
Since the long rejection of the surrender proposal the troops had again survived a long terrible week of

557
01:07:55.18 --> 01:08:02.14
Tenacious defensive fighting retreat and flight there by tying down superior enemy forces in their area

558
01:08:03.34 --> 01:08:05.98
Now after the loss of our life support base

559
01:08:06.22 --> 01:08:12.46
Petomnik airfield on January 16th the time really seemed to have come to stop fighting

560
01:08:13.26 --> 01:08:15.66
The airlift temporarily ceased altogether

561
01:08:15.66 --> 01:08:23.58
No more food and ammunition came in the wounded in sick could no longer be flown out and so

562
01:08:23.98 --> 01:08:25.66
That's where they're getting their supplies into

563
01:08:26.14 --> 01:08:31.18
Petomnik airfield and that's actually where this guy was for a large chunk of this battle

564
01:08:31.18 --> 01:08:35.66
It's now gone so now they even you know before they were only getting one fifth of what they needed

565
01:08:36.22 --> 01:08:38.22
Well now they're getting zero

566
01:08:38.22 --> 01:08:45.10
By now every day that the fighting was prolonged was costing thousands of human lives

567
01:08:45.74 --> 01:08:50.46
There was no more time to be lost and we waited for something to happen like me in

568
01:08:50.46 --> 01:08:56.22
Newmirable comrades and brothers in fate probably clung to the same secret hope but nothing happened

569
01:08:57.42 --> 01:08:59.42
And tragedy took its course

570
01:09:02.06 --> 01:09:08.06
The Russians by using their storm troops during the initial days of the offensive it would probably have been very easy for them

571
01:09:08.06 --> 01:09:11.58
To make a further effort and liquidate the pocket relatively quickly

572
01:09:13.02 --> 01:09:18.70
But they no longer needed to make such a highly costly attempt time was on their side

573
01:09:19.26 --> 01:09:25.26
By bearing down on our tenacious defense with a crushing attack our enemy had won its penetration into the pocket

574
01:09:26.06 --> 01:09:31.34
Now he was no longer in a hurry and no longer appeared to consider his victim to be very dangerous

575
01:09:32.06 --> 01:09:37.74
The battle that had begun in the meantime was merely a question of finishing off a wounded game already marked

576
01:09:37.74 --> 01:09:39.74
For death

577
01:09:39.98 --> 01:09:44.14
For some time already the Russians had dictated the course of events

578
01:09:45.58 --> 01:09:49.58
The date of our final end depended on their will alone

579
01:09:53.26 --> 01:10:02.30
The stations of the cross of an army of 200,000 soldiers particularly because of the slow helpless death of such a vast number of human beings

580
01:10:02.30 --> 01:10:07.98
Made anything seen before with the exception of verb done pale by comparison

581
01:10:09.34 --> 01:10:17.82
A part of the entire German nation was sentenced to death here and by this its vital substance was dangerously under attack

582
01:10:19.50 --> 01:10:23.02
The moral effect of these events touched the whole nation

583
01:10:24.54 --> 01:10:30.78
In the midst of the general destruction of the army there were thousands of individual tragedies

584
01:10:30.78 --> 01:10:36.86
whose localities of horror were the numerous collection points for the sick and wounded

585
01:10:38.06 --> 01:10:48.14
whole convoys of mostly open trucks overloaded with their pitiful freight of freezing wounded groaning sick and dying move deeper into the pocket

586
01:10:50.78 --> 01:10:53.50
From the second half of January until the bitter end

587
01:10:53.50 --> 01:11:00.78
The harsh suffering of the fighting soldiers continued by day and night

588
01:11:01.10 --> 01:11:05.34
After eight evil weeks of indescribable torture and deprivations

589
01:11:05.50 --> 01:11:09.18
They were now plunged into a veritable hell of hopelessness and destruction

590
01:11:10.94 --> 01:11:19.74
Time and again it was fight resist hold to the end then disengage with draw turn back and dig in again for defense in the snow and stonally

591
01:11:19.74 --> 01:11:26.54
Harg frozen earth time and again there were heavy losses panic and flight and then never ending use the struggle

592
01:11:27.02 --> 01:11:29.02
Struggle against hunger and cold

593
01:11:30.06 --> 01:11:33.02
Among the staffs there was an unending tension

594
01:11:33.34 --> 01:11:39.10
Proplexity and despair and feverish activity leadership was still to be seen

595
01:11:39.74 --> 01:11:43.02
From the higher-head commands came continual orders

596
01:11:43.18 --> 01:11:46.14
Directives questions add munitions threats

597
01:11:46.14 --> 01:11:53.66
Criticism opposition and misgivings were not lacking at the lower levels, but for the time being the mechanisms of command still function

598
01:11:53.66 --> 01:11:56.30
So despite all this and even though they're having this this

599
01:11:57.50 --> 01:12:01.82
Hastie would draw that's going against orders. There still are

600
01:12:02.30 --> 01:12:04.78
Direction coming out. There's till people being disciplined

601
01:12:08.06 --> 01:12:14.06
In the midst of the general suffering and dying we helplessly watch the catastrophe and of destruction approaching us

602
01:12:14.06 --> 01:12:16.06
mercilessly and inexorably

603
01:12:17.90 --> 01:12:23.58
The terrible human tragedy that was nearing its climax was finally commented commented upon by the war

604
01:12:23.98 --> 01:12:27.42
News broadcasted home in the pretty and spirited words

605
01:12:28.22 --> 01:12:30.62
Equate in stonel and grad

606
01:12:30.62 --> 01:12:42.70
Sixth Army is attaching immortal honor to its banners by its heroic and self-sacrificing battle against crushing odds

607
01:12:45.34 --> 01:12:52.62
Many of my comrades had mentally written themselves off intentions to commit suicide were voiced with increasing frequency

608
01:12:52.62 --> 01:12:58.30
Others had given their valuables and wedding rings to be to the wounded being flown out I

609
01:13:00.70 --> 01:13:07.74
Myself had been had so far been at pain to prepare my relatives for the catastrophe by means of sparse hints

610
01:13:08.62 --> 01:13:13.42
Now I felt the need to send home open word of farewell and gratitude

611
01:13:13.42 --> 01:13:22.46
The letter was hard to write in my ears once more rang rang the last goodbye my wife and

612
01:13:22.46 --> 01:13:29.98
Employingly and besiegingly called down the telephone line to Kiev on a spring evening of last year before the seemingly

613
01:13:30.62 --> 01:13:33.82
Endless space of Russian planes had swallowed me up

614
01:13:36.54 --> 01:13:38.54
Now all would soon be over

615
01:13:38.54 --> 01:13:43.98
When I sealed the letter I was gripped by a specially deep despair

616
01:13:45.50 --> 01:13:52.06
I felt as though I were suddenly looking into an abyss of suffering and hopelessness towards which our whole nation was

617
01:13:52.06 --> 01:13:56.30
Reeling as if the events in stalin grad were a preview of an

618
01:13:56.62 --> 01:13:59.74
Immeasurable disaster that was to break upon Germany

619
01:13:59.74 --> 01:14:09.10
The general of this division division had a nervous breakdown and was no longer fit for command

620
01:14:09.10 --> 01:14:14.22
His hopes of being flown out with the badly wounded and second not been fulfilled

621
01:14:14.62 --> 01:14:17.90
He now had to share the fate of his soldiers to the bitter end

622
01:14:18.30 --> 01:14:25.10
This general who a short time before was a commander of a division had carried the responsibility from many thousands of men

623
01:14:25.10 --> 01:14:30.14
Was once more a mere human being trembling for his life

624
01:14:31.90 --> 01:14:37.18
Then did his questions not reveal the same fear that secretly tormented all of us

625
01:14:38.78 --> 01:14:43.10
We made one another realize that the impending military

626
01:14:43.42 --> 01:14:51.02
Cretastrophe was also a political catastrophe the result of presumptuous beliefs and actions that had long

627
01:14:51.02 --> 01:14:56.78
Shaken the healthy foundations of our intellectual cultural and national life

628
01:14:59.02 --> 01:15:06.78
Had the power that we served as citizens and soldiers bent its knee before the law that was rooted in the code of ethics

629
01:15:08.14 --> 01:15:19.26
Or rather had not a new gospel of violence been proclaimed and introduced that in a fatal reversal of all values had ceased to differentiate

630
01:15:19.26 --> 01:15:21.26
Between right and wrong

631
01:15:25.02 --> 01:15:30.62
So these guys are realizing what's coming around what's coming around?

632
01:15:30.62 --> 01:15:35.26
He's realizing that the path that they went down as a country was wrong

633
01:15:38.62 --> 01:15:46.06
Back to the book by means of destructive battle against the universal educational and cultural powers of

634
01:15:46.06 --> 01:15:53.82
Classic antiquity humanism and Christianity and anti intellectual political religion of power

635
01:15:55.10 --> 01:16:02.38
Had successfully extracted the German people from the best of the commonly held European body of human thought and

636
01:16:02.62 --> 01:16:07.74
thereby also out of any commitment to the objective concepts of truth

637
01:16:08.54 --> 01:16:10.54
Compassion and justice

638
01:16:11.98 --> 01:16:14.62
Is that is that his conclusion like

639
01:16:14.62 --> 01:16:22.62
During this events or yes during these events he's realizing what what's happening?

640
01:16:22.94 --> 01:16:24.94
Is that they were wrong

641
01:16:26.14 --> 01:16:29.02
And they went I mean the thing that's crazy about

642
01:16:29.90 --> 01:16:34.78
Nazi Germany is how fast that transition took place like the talking 10 years

643
01:16:35.34 --> 01:16:38.54
What the rise of the Nazis rise the Nazis or they're they're they're

644
01:16:39.50 --> 01:16:41.58
Yeah, the rise of the Nazis straight up

645
01:16:41.58 --> 01:16:48.22
1933 they started now 1943 so or 10 years and you have a completely different viewpoint of the world

646
01:16:51.18 --> 01:16:53.82
That's okay, I mean and it's not they're going against

647
01:16:54.38 --> 01:16:57.10
They see what like they're going against the traditional values

648
01:16:57.66 --> 01:17:00.78
They're going against hey, you know they're going against the Christian values

649
01:17:00.78 --> 01:17:04.38
They're going against the cultural values they're going against the national values

650
01:17:04.38 --> 01:17:13.50
They're going against them. Yeah, it's I wonder how much of it is that you know like the soldiers and that even the people in the Nazi party

651
01:17:13.50 --> 01:17:20.30
I wonder how much of it is like denial, you know, you know where it's you know how like you're signed on to like some leader during the during the time being yeah

652
01:17:20.30 --> 01:17:23.34
Yeah, or you saying right now how much of this denial no no no no

653
01:17:23.74 --> 01:17:26.94
During during the last you know, it's like remember rap and egg egg

654
01:17:26.94 --> 01:17:32.06
You remember that there was one of the nicest guys one of the guys who made the biggest sacrifice was a was a straight-up actual Nazi

655
01:17:32.06 --> 01:17:38.22
And you made massive sacrifice until queued risk to save as many people as he could by the way not white people not

656
01:17:38.22 --> 01:17:40.22
Ariens, but but Chinese

657
01:17:40.86 --> 01:17:42.86
So so there's a guy that

658
01:17:42.86 --> 01:17:46.22
You know was more related to the traditional

659
01:17:47.26 --> 01:17:49.26
Christian intellectual

660
01:17:51.02 --> 01:17:57.34
Values right and yet okay the people that are in charge of the country is Nazi so I guess that makes me an Nazi

661
01:17:57.34 --> 01:18:01.98
Yeah, and here we go and so and these guys war situation because their soldiers

662
01:18:02.54 --> 01:18:04.94
So now they're fighting for that evil force

663
01:18:05.66 --> 01:18:12.46
And like you said there's some denial you also get caught up and clearly the Germans got caught up in the nationalism

664
01:18:12.46 --> 01:18:19.18
They got caught up hitler was a great orator and a very moving speaker and they got caught up in that and they were in a very depressed economy

665
01:18:19.18 --> 01:18:24.54
So those things all kind of came to it they'd been in their mind screwed over in World War one and

666
01:18:24.54 --> 01:18:31.10
You know defeated and then treated badly and you know there's this whole thing about Hitler's mustache

667
01:18:31.10 --> 01:18:33.10
You know Hitler's got the funny mustache and

668
01:18:34.38 --> 01:18:37.50
There's some debate on on how much of this is

669
01:18:38.22 --> 01:18:42.54
Actually true, but whether it's true or not as a little bit it doesn't really matter

670
01:18:43.58 --> 01:18:49.42
Because what it represents so the deal was that Hitler's mustache if you wanted to have a mustache during World War one

671
01:18:49.58 --> 01:18:52.94
Because of wearing a gas mask you had to cut your mustache like that

672
01:18:52.94 --> 01:18:58.30
Mm-hmm Hitler still wore his mustache like that it was like a constant symbol that

673
01:18:58.62 --> 01:19:04.54
He remembered he remembered because he was in World War one and he was wounded in World War one and

674
01:19:04.86 --> 01:19:09.66
Through even despite all that insane sacrifice they didn't win and

675
01:19:10.38 --> 01:19:15.18
They didn't like the way they got treated by the treated Versailles and so they had that angst

676
01:19:15.18 --> 01:19:19.50
They had the economic angst they had all those angst built up and hit look came along and was

677
01:19:19.50 --> 01:19:25.90
Ready to let them focus on something else and and now what what

678
01:19:26.54 --> 01:19:33.26
Weedor is realizing here is like yeah, he had us focus on something else all right and what he helped how to focus on wasn't good. It was evil

679
01:19:35.10 --> 01:19:37.10
This is

680
01:19:37.26 --> 01:19:39.26
crude

681
01:19:39.82 --> 01:19:41.82
Analogy

682
01:19:42.46 --> 01:19:47.26
You ought to training day. I have watched training day, but that's kind of the same thing when you watch because

683
01:19:47.26 --> 01:19:53.42
Jinway because the new he's the trainee by the way when I see a movie I see it like one time in an airplane and I know

684
01:19:53.42 --> 01:19:56.06
Yeah, yeah, so I'm not I'm not gonna be fully familiar with

685
01:19:56.78 --> 01:20:01.74
Comparing the rise of Nazi journaling enough that's millions of people to the movie training

686
01:20:02.94 --> 01:20:07.34
And this is total speculation is just what we're talking about as far as like you know people

687
01:20:07.34 --> 01:20:11.34
They're signed on hey, I'm German, you know, it's cool and you know world German work

688
01:20:11.34 --> 01:20:16.30
You know solidarity we're doing and then kind of the Nazi party starts rising starts giving these sort of

689
01:20:16.30 --> 01:20:23.18
Certain types of influence and they're like oh all right cool. I mean, I wasn't really thinking that but all right we're still Germans

690
01:20:23.18 --> 01:20:27.18
We're cool and it starts escalating and slowly it's like okay, so you can't turn back

691
01:20:27.66 --> 01:20:32.14
That's what happens training game right yeah, like he he signed on he signed on and he's like dang

692
01:20:32.14 --> 01:20:36.78
He's like I don't know about all this, but all right. Hey, I'm signed on to the cause and after awhile

693
01:20:36.78 --> 01:20:38.78
Which is the same point that this guy got?

694
01:20:38.78 --> 01:20:46.22
I'm got to where it's like man. Okay. You guys pushed it too much man. I can't sign on to this and then you reflect back on all the vitally

695
01:20:46.22 --> 01:20:49.18
Ships you don't like you start to slip

696
01:20:50.38 --> 01:20:54.86
You start to slip when you don't hold the line. Yeah, things that's what happens yeah, and

697
01:20:56.14 --> 01:20:59.42
That's what makes leadership hard that's what makes life hard

698
01:20:59.98 --> 01:21:04.86
Yeah, it's really easy to get tempted to go down these trails these paths

699
01:21:05.58 --> 01:21:08.30
That are not what you should be doing

700
01:21:08.78 --> 01:21:13.90
Right and like I you got a kind of in mintment. It's hard because in the in the beginning like

701
01:21:13.90 --> 01:21:19.66
You know, you're you're going on a path you're already signed on right and you see one teeny tiny violation

702
01:21:19.90 --> 01:21:23.82
And it's like what am I gonna do like make this big stink about this teeny tiny violation?

703
01:21:23.82 --> 01:21:29.02
Yeah, sure, then you keep going and then you'd already made that exception

704
01:21:29.02 --> 01:21:33.34
Yeah, time goes on is what you can do bring that little thing again. Psychologically what

705
01:21:35.26 --> 01:21:37.26
Denzel Washington

706
01:21:37.26 --> 01:21:44.46
He's he's he doesn't introduce he's gonna straight to level eight violation right? He just gets little yeah little violation

707
01:21:44.46 --> 01:21:48.26
To 20 feet down the pit a little bit of abuse there, but hey, we're fighting bad

708
01:21:48.78 --> 01:21:51.98
It's a bad call good and then like a little like what what you know

709
01:21:52.54 --> 01:21:55.58
Yeah exactly right and that's that's what that's what Hitler did yeah

710
01:21:55.66 --> 01:21:59.18
That's what Hitler started with like hey, you know, we don't want to have this happening

711
01:21:59.58 --> 01:22:03.74
Yeah, we gotta keep these things in check. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look we're gonna at least we're gonna

712
01:22:03.74 --> 01:22:08.62
Put the Jews in a neighborhood right we'll put them in a separate neighborhood that way. They're not amongst us right?

713
01:22:08.86 --> 01:22:11.02
Put them over there. You know and that's okay

714
01:22:11.02 --> 01:22:12.78
You know what we're actually not gonna win them. We're gonna move them somewhere else

715
01:22:13.02 --> 01:22:18.86
We're gonna work camp okay, and then you just right you slowly escalating for your murdering two six million people

716
01:22:20.30 --> 01:22:25.90
And then all of a sudden what you're not signing on all of a sudden. Yeah, and a thing and you're like

717
01:22:25.90 --> 01:22:29.66
Damn, oh, it's a sign on to some of the stuff earlier, but I had let it go. I'm trapped

718
01:22:29.66 --> 01:22:33.98
You know, yeah, I'm not your trapped and that's where he is right now and he's trapped facing his death

719
01:22:35.74 --> 01:22:38.94
And recognize yeah recognizing that

720
01:22:40.30 --> 01:22:42.30
Yeah, successfully

721
01:22:42.30 --> 01:22:48.38
Extracted the German people from the best of the commonly held European body of human thought like you

722
01:22:48.62 --> 01:22:52.86
Same exactly what you just said success successively. It's just a little bit of a time

723
01:22:52.86 --> 01:22:59.66
of it back to the book all of us who were a uniform were entangled in a fabric of

724
01:22:59.90 --> 01:23:03.90
Developments and circumstances that we certainly had not sought or desired

725
01:23:05.02 --> 01:23:07.02
Now let's not make any excuses

726
01:23:08.14 --> 01:23:10.14
Let's not make any excuses

727
01:23:11.26 --> 01:23:14.46
But we see how it kind of happened as you just said

728
01:23:15.82 --> 01:23:21.26
We surely could not believe that our employment here in Stalingrad was part of a noble legitimate battle for

729
01:23:21.26 --> 01:23:23.26
German in interests

730
01:23:23.26 --> 01:23:30.62
painfully we felt that the soldierly virtues of bravery commitment loyalty no beatings to duty in the objective sense

731
01:23:30.94 --> 01:23:33.42
We're being despicably misused

732
01:23:34.78 --> 01:23:42.22
This deep in the tragedy of cruel events in which we now would have to atone for much that we had never wanted

733
01:23:44.38 --> 01:23:46.38
So yeah

734
01:23:47.42 --> 01:23:49.42
That's

735
01:23:49.42 --> 01:23:51.42
You know I've heard that argument sometimes

736
01:23:52.22 --> 01:24:00.38
If you well you're gonna kill but there's a bad regime and you're gonna go and you're gonna attack the regime and then some of the people that are just there by chance

737
01:24:00.94 --> 01:24:02.94
You know you hear that argument well

738
01:24:03.10 --> 01:24:05.58
They're allowing that regime to exist

739
01:24:05.90 --> 01:24:10.22
Now that's a tough argument to have because you got some of you for them to

740
01:24:10.78 --> 01:24:12.30
Rebell could mean death

741
01:24:12.30 --> 01:24:17.82
So they don't get they don't rebel and so they end up in a bad situation that's a tough one

742
01:24:17.82 --> 01:24:20.86
Yeah, but somebody asked me the other day

743
01:24:23.34 --> 01:24:25.34
Yeah, it's a long those lines

744
01:24:26.22 --> 01:24:30.06
You know some long winded questioning on Twitter about what would you do if you were in a

745
01:24:31.02 --> 01:24:37.82
In you know inside of a state that was Bob all you know repressive and etc. etc. No, this is a go-on word answer rebellion

746
01:24:38.46 --> 01:24:40.46
Now what I have the

747
01:24:40.46 --> 01:24:48.06
Mentality that I have right now if I grow up in one of those repressive states probably now I probably just want to survive and get some more bread. Yeah, right?

748
01:24:48.62 --> 01:24:54.54
I might not just be thinking hey there's there's something more important than me and that's freedom

749
01:24:55.50 --> 01:24:56.62
And

750
01:24:56.62 --> 01:25:02.38
This maybe I wouldn't think that maybe I just be thinking hey I want some maybe I can get an extra 20 grams of bread

751
01:25:03.18 --> 01:25:05.18
No, no

752
01:25:06.46 --> 01:25:09.50
All right back to the book in this is good in

753
01:25:09.50 --> 01:25:11.50
The proximity of death

754
01:25:12.70 --> 01:25:15.66
Things appeared in their true light and proper order

755
01:25:16.54 --> 01:25:23.98
In such a situation the Bible speaks to us with an insistence and clarity the like of which we had never felt

756
01:25:23.98 --> 01:25:33.34
They're understood before the fear and misery at the edge of our existence had given us a religious experience who strength giving power

757
01:25:33.82 --> 01:25:35.82
bound us together

758
01:25:35.82 --> 01:25:42.06
So he's starting to see relative there's no atheist and a foxhole guess what?

759
01:25:44.30 --> 01:25:46.62
According to weater that's a very accurate statement

760
01:25:48.14 --> 01:25:54.86
Among my favorite books in the little private library I had taken with me to the eastern front was a copy of Marcus Araleus's

761
01:25:55.42 --> 01:25:57.42
self observations

762
01:25:58.86 --> 01:25:59.42
I

763
01:25:59.42 --> 01:26:02.22
To had often found support and comfort in it

764
01:26:02.22 --> 01:26:09.50
It had contributed markedly to completing my equipment for war by serving me as a suit of armor that

765
01:26:09.50 --> 01:26:15.18
Protected me from all two frequent warnings by events and giving me an inner

766
01:26:16.14 --> 01:26:18.14
equanimity

767
01:26:18.38 --> 01:26:20.38
Now this book to

768
01:26:21.02 --> 01:26:24.06
Like several others had become meaningless

769
01:26:25.10 --> 01:26:28.14
The wisdom of the world the wisdom of the world

770
01:26:28.14 --> 01:26:32.14
With its merely human temporal comfort had failed

771
01:26:33.18 --> 01:26:35.50
It did not penetrate into the

772
01:26:36.38 --> 01:26:43.66
Ultimate and most profound and could no longer stand firm in the terrible shock and helplessness whose mercy I felt

773
01:26:43.98 --> 01:26:49.74
Myself to be in in extreme distress with the ground shaking underfoot and

774
01:26:49.82 --> 01:26:56.30
Amenacing a bits of nothingness seeming to open before me. There was only one last support

775
01:26:56.30 --> 01:26:59.66
The comforting strength of the Christian belief

776
01:27:02.14 --> 01:27:07.82
Perhaps we could pass some of this comfort and support on to other comrades who bewildered were

777
01:27:07.82 --> 01:27:09.82
Reeling toward the abyss

778
01:27:10.54 --> 01:27:16.14
In their desperation faced with the destruction of a whole world of concepts and in a view of the senseless

779
01:27:16.14 --> 01:27:24.54
Senselessness of the catastrophe many a soldier on the staffs as well as within the fighting troops had reached for his pistol to put an end to his life

780
01:27:26.14 --> 01:27:32.14
There was no way back and no escape other disguise their secret fear and inner feelings of emptiness

781
01:27:32.14 --> 01:27:37.58
Behind a contrived soldierly stance or even deliberately assumed to the cast of

782
01:27:38.70 --> 01:27:40.70
Mind of a lanks neck

783
01:27:40.70 --> 01:27:46.78
Which is like these guys were these old school German mercenaries that were

784
01:27:47.74 --> 01:27:53.26
Super hardcore if they themselves were doomed to go under they would at least sell their skin

785
01:27:53.26 --> 01:27:58.70
So dearly to the end and take as many Russians with them as they could now that's interesting he's he's

786
01:27:59.42 --> 01:28:02.06
projecting on these soldiers

787
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:06.22
That you know that they're disguising their secret fear

788
01:28:06.22 --> 01:28:11.10
You know what I'm telling you right now that some of those Nazi German soldiers they were

789
01:28:11.90 --> 01:28:14.86
They were getting after it right they weren't they weren't

790
01:28:15.42 --> 01:28:20.14
hiding their their secret fear by acting tough they were ready to die for the fear

791
01:28:20.94 --> 01:28:25.74
So let's not just paint with a broad brush there in my opinion

792
01:28:28.86 --> 01:28:34.06
If we agreed that suicide was out of the question for religious and ethical reasons

793
01:28:34.06 --> 01:28:40.06
As normal we human beings caught up in error and guilt there was nothing left to

794
01:28:40.54 --> 01:28:45.34
To us put to drink the cup of suffering to the last bitter drags

795
01:28:49.50 --> 01:28:50.70
Yeah

796
01:28:50.70 --> 01:28:55.42
In the meantime something unbelievable to happen and made quickly made the rounds our quartermaster

797
01:28:55.42 --> 01:29:00.06
A still young general staff officer had suddenly disappeared his driver who had taken to the

798
01:29:00.06 --> 01:29:05.10
Gumrak air base had waited in vain for his return the lieutenant Colonel was missing

799
01:29:05.26 --> 01:29:11.98
He had silently left Stalin-Grad left the Stalin-Grad pocket the zone of death and destruction on his own initiative

800
01:29:12.62 --> 01:29:17.50
Probably is a mixture of nerves fear cowardice and the vain hope then in the general confusion

801
01:29:17.50 --> 01:29:21.58
He might be able to fly out and save his life that attempted him to desert

802
01:29:22.46 --> 01:29:27.58
The commanding general had made increase by radio the deserting staff officer had shown up at army group

803
01:29:27.58 --> 01:29:31.58
Plaming the flow now on official assignment from the core on matters of supply

804
01:29:32.62 --> 01:29:39.90
Our general was wild with indignation and rage to declare that he would have the criminal flown back into the pocket and shot before our eyes

805
01:29:41.26 --> 01:29:47.10
We were all deeply depressed and and with and anticipated with horror the terrible scene that had been announced

806
01:29:47.42 --> 01:29:54.46
And which we were spared to our relief our quartermaster was shot outside the pocket on the spot where in his fatal weakness

807
01:29:54.46 --> 01:30:01.18
He had hoped to find a door to freedom in life so again even though I just talked about some of the Nazis being

808
01:30:01.90 --> 01:30:06.54
Committed to the end there was many of them that were just trying to get the hell out of there

809
01:30:10.38 --> 01:30:13.82
Back to the book our commanding general spoke openly of the impending collapse

810
01:30:14.06 --> 01:30:19.02
Occusingly and with bitterness and secret anger he pointed out that it was not our fault

811
01:30:19.02 --> 01:30:25.34
We had gotten into this deviless situation of a catastrophe from which there was no longer means of escape. Okay

812
01:30:26.70 --> 01:30:31.58
Here he is the commanding general is now saying hey look. This is not our fault

813
01:30:33.10 --> 01:30:38.54
So clear he's obviously not taking any ownership of this, but okay, so it's only asking this

814
01:30:40.14 --> 01:30:44.22
Okay, Jocco what would it how would it help him if he was to take ownership of it right now?

815
01:30:44.62 --> 01:30:46.86
Right if he was to say hey, this is my fault

816
01:30:46.86 --> 01:30:50.70
Would it help him could it could if you say hey look this is my fault. This is why this happened

817
01:30:51.34 --> 01:30:53.34
Would that help him right now

818
01:30:54.22 --> 01:30:57.98
No, you're right it wouldn't help them what did have helped him a

819
01:30:58.54 --> 01:31:02.46
Month or two months ago if he said to himself look we're in the situation

820
01:31:02.46 --> 01:31:07.26
I need to take ownership of it and get it fixed what it have helped them you're damn right it would of

821
01:31:07.42 --> 01:31:12.70
He was saying you know what Hitler might not tell might be telling us not to break out guess what Hitler's not here

822
01:31:12.70 --> 01:31:18.94
We're gonna break out I'll go get shot for defying his orders. That's fine. I'll save all of you

823
01:31:19.42 --> 01:31:23.50
That's that's where ownership would have come in but what he said was like wait wait

824
01:31:23.50 --> 01:31:27.10
We're assigned to our fate. I talk about this all the time just because the boss tells you

825
01:31:27.58 --> 01:31:31.50
Or doesn't give you this support that you need or gives you a bad order that doesn't give you the excuse

826
01:31:31.74 --> 01:31:35.90
You can't put the ownership on the boss and you're the one in charge you take ownership of it

827
01:31:35.90 --> 01:31:37.90
You get the problem solved he didn't do that

828
01:31:37.90 --> 01:31:46.78
So he he's not I don't want to say allow to say it's not our fault, but he okay him saying it's not our fault

829
01:31:48.46 --> 01:31:53.74
Is a kind of a different circumstance? Why because they're past the point of no return because they're doomed already

830
01:31:54.46 --> 01:31:56.46
Yes, because they don't have any

831
01:31:56.46 --> 01:31:59.66
You know take responsibility and then take responsibility for the

832
01:32:00.54 --> 01:32:04.22
Fixing the mistakes there is no fixing mistakes anymore. That's why if I was him

833
01:32:04.22 --> 01:32:08.14
Yeah, I would have said hey guys. It's not your fault that you're here. This is my fault

834
01:32:08.62 --> 01:32:15.18
I should have made a moonover. I should have stood up to the boss. I didn't here's what we're gonna do now defend ourselves the best of our ability

835
01:32:15.58 --> 01:32:19.74
right, right, so then that would still give the guys some

836
01:32:20.94 --> 01:32:23.42
Breathing room right some psychological breathing room

837
01:32:24.54 --> 01:32:29.50
They fought hard they did their best. It's my fault. I should have I should have held you guys do something different and I didn't

838
01:32:29.50 --> 01:32:34.94
Here's what we're gonna do now the fact that he that these that he wasn't taking ownership earlier

839
01:32:35.58 --> 01:32:37.58
the fact that he's able to blame now

840
01:32:38.30 --> 01:32:42.30
Means he was able to blame earlier and if you're but the minute you start blaming you're not solving anything

841
01:32:42.30 --> 01:32:44.30
You're not getting things done. There you go

842
01:32:44.86 --> 01:32:46.86
Yeah

843
01:32:47.66 --> 01:32:53.50
Back to the book, but he left no doubt that together we still had a task to perform naming to namely to fulfill our

844
01:32:53.50 --> 01:32:59.26
Soldiers, we were soldially due to duty to the last moment. You know, beating into the orders from above we were defend our perimeter

845
01:32:59.74 --> 01:33:05.18
Fighting shoulder to shoulder with our carbines to the last bullet from his words we could surmise that he was

846
01:33:05.42 --> 01:33:11.02
Stanchly determined to go down like a captain with his ship and not to survive the downfall of his troops

847
01:33:11.34 --> 01:33:20.14
On equivocally he pointed out that the commandments of the traditional ethical code of the soldier now demand at our ultimate sacrifice without

848
01:33:20.14 --> 01:33:22.14
Demur

849
01:33:25.82 --> 01:33:32.78
Now at this point he's supposed to go out and do a do like a reconnaissance of the lines and see what's going on

850
01:33:34.06 --> 01:33:38.78
And when he's up there here's what he sees in freezing cold and wild snow for your flurry

851
01:33:38.78 --> 01:33:43.90
Zyrode across the desolate battlefield on a motorcycle together with a sergeant of the military police

852
01:33:44.14 --> 01:33:46.46
We soon reach the road of catastrophic

853
01:33:46.46 --> 01:33:55.58
We soon reach the road of catastrophe arising dark gray against the backdrop of a snow bound step marked by all kinds of abandoned rubbish

854
01:33:55.58 --> 01:34:02.46
Half-covered cadavers of horses and wrecked vehicles scattered pieces of equipment crates destroyed weapons

855
01:34:02.86 --> 01:34:06.38
The disperse the starving the freezing the sick

856
01:34:06.70 --> 01:34:14.54
But all those still fit for fighting had only one objective to which they were attaching their last glimmering as of hope and this objective was stolen

857
01:34:14.54 --> 01:34:19.90
Grot in the protective walls of the sellers of the ruins. They might still be able to find some warmth

858
01:34:20.46 --> 01:34:28.86
Food rest sleep and salvation and so they streamed by the remains of the shattered and decimated formation

859
01:34:29.34 --> 01:34:37.42
Trains and re-election on services with vehicles that were slowly being dragged and pushed by wounded sick and frost bitten men

860
01:34:37.42 --> 01:34:46.78
There were a macheted figures among them muffled in coats, rags, pitiful rags, painfully dragging themselves forward

861
01:34:46.78 --> 01:34:54.46
Leaning on sticks and hobbling all along the frozen feet wrapped in whispers of straw and strips of blankets

862
01:34:55.66 --> 01:35:04.22
Drifting along through the snowstorm this was the wreck of the six-th Army that had advanced to the vulga during the summer so confident of victory

863
01:35:04.22 --> 01:35:11.66
Men from all over Germany doomed to destruction in a far-off land mutely enduring their suffering

864
01:35:12.22 --> 01:35:14.22
Tottered in pitiful drove

865
01:35:14.62 --> 01:35:17.18
Drills through the murderous eastern winter

866
01:35:17.90 --> 01:35:23.82
These were the same soldiers who had formally marched through the large parts of Europe's as proud conquerors

867
01:35:23.82 --> 01:35:34.22
Now the enemy was at their backs and death lurked everywhere

868
01:35:36.62 --> 01:35:44.14
There's an interesting piece that I don't go into too much but this guy had written a paper

869
01:35:44.14 --> 01:35:46.14
and presented it up the chain of command

870
01:35:46.14 --> 01:35:55.74
with talking about what happened in Napoleon and he got kind of told like hey that's not going to happen

871
01:35:55.74 --> 01:36:01.18
us back to the book the events of 1812 seemed to be repeating themselves after all once again the

872
01:36:01.18 --> 01:36:06.62
Uncanny Russian space was swallowing many tens of thousands of human beings despite Napoleon's

873
01:36:06.62 --> 01:36:12.78
Experience the basic elements of geography and meteorology had again been ignored to a frightening degree

874
01:36:12.78 --> 01:36:21.98
On top of that the modern superstition that with the help of machines and motors the impossible could be accomplished and the dangers of space overcome

875
01:36:21.98 --> 01:36:24.38
had also contributed to our downfall

876
01:36:25.26 --> 01:36:34.14
And in a fatal pact with the overestimation of mechanized means of war had stood the misapprehension of the limits of human strength and possibilities

877
01:36:36.06 --> 01:36:38.06
Yeah repeat

878
01:36:38.06 --> 01:36:43.82
Yeah, you think that one another one of those classic lines that's not gonna happen us. Oh, yeah, that's like it feels like yeah

879
01:36:43.82 --> 01:36:47.90
You know, that's a classic mistake. It's called the ego called lack of humility

880
01:36:49.50 --> 01:36:53.82
Don't want to happen us happen to Napoleon one of the greatest you know military leaders of all time

881
01:36:53.82 --> 01:37:00.46
But it won't happen us because we have some cars we got some tanks or whatever but by the way tanks tank fuel

882
01:37:00.94 --> 01:37:02.94
Where's that fuel gonna come from

883
01:37:02.94 --> 01:37:08.78
I mean at least a horse can eat at peace a hey right sure you know

884
01:37:10.78 --> 01:37:12.78
There's no

885
01:37:12.78 --> 01:37:14.78
Exxon station out there on the steps

886
01:37:17.18 --> 01:37:21.66
Back to the book together with several wounded we dragged ourselves on words until exhausted and shattered

887
01:37:21.66 --> 01:37:26.54
We finally reached the ruins of rubble of Northern Stalingrod City area so now he's actually

888
01:37:27.26 --> 01:37:29.58
Was retreating back to Stalingrod itself

889
01:37:29.58 --> 01:37:33.90
What trails did fate still hold and store for us?

890
01:37:34.70 --> 01:37:39.82
Death whom I'd faced more often and closely in recent days than ever before was still refusing me

891
01:37:40.22 --> 01:37:45.10
But as trusted companion for many weeks hunger was tormenting me with tenacious power

892
01:37:45.10 --> 01:37:47.74
Soly making me ripe for the end and

893
01:37:48.30 --> 01:37:56.54
Frost the third murderer in the trio had also bitten me by now as the constant stabbing pains and some of my limbs warned me

894
01:37:56.54 --> 01:38:05.42
Separated from our staff our group of officers found shelter in a dark dirty cellar while our men went to ground in a neighboring pile of rubber rubble

895
01:38:06.54 --> 01:38:09.66
This was to be the end of our flight and our last quarters

896
01:38:12.86 --> 01:38:15.42
The army had once again addressed itself to

897
01:38:16.14 --> 01:38:22.62
okay, H and pointing adamantly to the catastrophic situation had asked for immediate permission to surrender

898
01:38:22.62 --> 01:38:28.30
Which might possibly prevent still complete dissolution

899
01:38:29.90 --> 01:38:32.14
Disolution and total disaster

900
01:38:33.18 --> 01:38:35.90
Hey, Lersancer had been a steely no

901
01:38:37.66 --> 01:38:46.22
For bid surrender Hitler had radiot into the pocket on 25 January the army will hold its position to the last man and bullet

902
01:38:46.22 --> 01:38:51.74
Imagine being that freezing hungry

903
01:38:52.54 --> 01:38:57.82
Tortured by the enemy at your back and you got some guy in a

904
01:38:59.26 --> 01:39:01.26
It a nice

905
01:39:02.38 --> 01:39:04.38
Drediculous

906
01:39:05.66 --> 01:39:10.86
It's one thing to be like yeah, we're going to the last one to last bullet and it's this big war

907
01:39:10.86 --> 01:39:17.26
But it lasts and you know, I don't know week not even a week. You know like the that one big last stand

908
01:39:17.26 --> 01:39:20.54
And we're going to fight to the death that's one thing and I did it and that's you know

909
01:39:21.10 --> 01:39:28.14
But just weeks and weeks and weeks of just slowly dying of starvation and sickness and that's way different

910
01:39:28.46 --> 01:39:30.14
It's way different to try to

911
01:39:30.78 --> 01:39:38.78
Fight till the last man and the last bullet in that scenario. Yeah, especially because they they all kind of know that there's no strategic

912
01:39:38.78 --> 01:39:40.78
Advantage to what they're doing

913
01:39:44.46 --> 01:39:51.82
Back to the book Colonel General Paulus and his chief of staff who's fanatic will to hold out was well known among the staffs

914
01:39:52.30 --> 01:39:54.62
Relentlessly held on to their fatal decision

915
01:39:55.18 --> 01:40:02.70
On their part many generals and their staffs remain the executioners of the orders of destruction under the sorry circumstances for fighting

916
01:40:03.02 --> 01:40:05.02
Suffering and dying continued

917
01:40:05.02 --> 01:40:13.18
Torcheringly and terribly after the splitting of the pocket the death agony of the army continued for a further week

918
01:40:15.10 --> 01:40:20.62
In the general dissolution and catastrophe it was every man for himself

919
01:40:21.98 --> 01:40:28.38
More and more order and discipline broke down here and there and the sellers the still able body didn't combat

920
01:40:28.38 --> 01:40:38.54
Were the hit among the second wounded cases of uncomrarotterly conduct theft of provisions refusal to obey orders and open mute knee-mounted

921
01:40:41.74 --> 01:40:43.74
The little late

922
01:40:44.06 --> 01:40:52.86
The elementary drive of self preservation no longer allowed the question of right or wrong to be raised and the same way that the differences

923
01:40:52.86 --> 01:41:00.70
Between the front line and rear line S. and the rear echelon were being erased so were the differences in rank and position

924
01:41:01.82 --> 01:41:07.08
In the final days summary law was imposed in stollongrad with drastic punishments for any crime

925
01:41:07.48 --> 01:41:16.54
Looters were to be shot within 24 hours hundreds of German soldiers who had become weak in their misery thus became victims of German bullets

926
01:41:16.54 --> 01:41:21.98
One could no longer generally speak of courageous and heroic fighting

927
01:41:23.10 --> 01:41:29.66
Certainly here and there there were individual deeds of courage personal initiative and noble self self sacrifice

928
01:41:30.30 --> 01:41:32.30
But by and large

929
01:41:32.54 --> 01:41:37.42
Only a mute submission to the inescapable fate remained to the bitter end

930
01:41:37.42 --> 01:41:44.78
It was rather the silent heroism of acceptance of suffering and submitting

931
01:41:49.18 --> 01:41:58.94
Not the picture that gets painted very often now at this point at this point right now in this battle is when they hear that speech

932
01:41:59.98 --> 01:42:05.90
That goering said talking about this great sacrifice and how they fought so well and how they'll be remembered

933
01:42:05.90 --> 01:42:07.90
forever

934
01:42:07.90 --> 01:42:10.90
and compared them to lianides and the

935
01:42:11.46 --> 01:42:13.90
300 Spartans at thermopoli. It's just

936
01:42:15.66 --> 01:42:17.66
And here's what these guys thought

937
01:42:19.90 --> 01:42:29.10
With overexaggerated feverish pathos this see the speaker recalled the heroic example of the last of the Goths and in the end the historical

938
01:42:29.10 --> 01:42:36.70
So famous sacrifice of the Spartan heroes at thermopoli who had not fault faltered or given ground until the last fighter had fallen

939
01:42:37.74 --> 01:42:42.38
And so it was at Stalin grad just like lianides in his loyal men in the Greek defile

940
01:42:42.86 --> 01:42:49.74
So with the German heroes lie on the vulga as the law of honor and conduct in war commanded them to do for Germany

941
01:42:49.74 --> 01:43:01.74
During this speech full of empty phrases and lies that out did itself in his sterical glorification and praises the demeanor of the deeply

942
01:43:01.74 --> 01:43:05.42
Delusioned and incensed audience became more and more hostile

943
01:43:06.78 --> 01:43:13.74
The glances gestures and words all around unmistakably showed the rage that was growing in people's souls

944
01:43:13.74 --> 01:43:21.10
Whoever might still have trusted in the promise of help from the outside now had to recognize with growing horror that at home

945
01:43:21.10 --> 01:43:26.38
Where relatives still hope for a union the warriors of Stalin grad had finally been written off

946
01:43:27.82 --> 01:43:32.22
We felt that we had heard our own funeral oration before it's time

947
01:43:33.66 --> 01:43:42.46
The disgusting adulation of the tortures dying of our army and the deceit for glorification of conditions that were against all laws of humanity

948
01:43:42.46 --> 01:43:44.94
filled me with indignition and

949
01:43:46.06 --> 01:43:48.06
Revolution

950
01:43:48.46 --> 01:43:55.98
Must not going go onings words have pierced the hearts of our loved ones at home like daggers and rob them of all hope now that they had been

951
01:43:55.98 --> 01:44:01.62
Fknown in the most anxious fears of art for our lives at home. We had been declared dead

952
01:44:01.62 --> 01:44:11.22
The heroization and mythical glorification of our stolen grad army was supposed to conceal the sad truth

953
01:44:12.74 --> 01:44:21.54
For a long time now the heroic tale of the German soldier on the vulga had become an irresponsible mass dying ordered from on high

954
01:44:23.62 --> 01:44:31.06
The pathetic propaganda of glorification was obviously intended to distract from the catastrophic consequences

955
01:44:31.06 --> 01:44:38.50
of a criminally amateurist leadership of war and to prevent the question of blame from even arising

956
01:44:44.74 --> 01:44:48.18
So you pretty much see how these guys felt at the end

957
01:44:51.38 --> 01:44:57.70
And now you might think you might think that there's a disconnect between

958
01:44:57.70 --> 01:45:05.78
Hitler, like hate, we're proud we're fighting to the end and this is the way the Germans are and this is the way we are we're superior

959
01:45:07.30 --> 01:45:10.34
And that the guys in the ground now they'll just beat down and so maybe they're just

960
01:45:10.98 --> 01:45:14.34
Maybe they're just weak right and they're just giving up you might think that

961
01:45:15.54 --> 01:45:20.74
You might think that here's this will give you a little indication that that's the wrong thought

962
01:45:20.74 --> 01:45:28.74
On the one February the news spread among us that Paulus had capitulated with his staff

963
01:45:29.46 --> 01:45:34.74
And the two southern segments of the pocket and gone into captivity. So the leader just surrendered

964
01:45:37.22 --> 01:45:39.46
At the last moment he had been promoted to field marshal

965
01:45:40.34 --> 01:45:43.62
This promotion in the hour of the final catastrophe was grow test

966
01:45:43.94 --> 01:45:47.14
It was simply a gesture of thanks from above and a goodbye

967
01:45:47.14 --> 01:45:50.34
So Hitler thought Paulus was gonna die

968
01:45:51.78 --> 01:45:53.78
Well he didn't

969
01:45:55.38 --> 01:45:57.38
Paulus surrendered

970
01:45:57.86 --> 01:46:03.54
But the unhappy field marshal did not set the example of heroism expected of him from the top

971
01:46:03.86 --> 01:46:10.02
The German papers broad cast later broad cast later tried to spread the impression the style of going

972
01:46:10.02 --> 01:46:15.14
Speech that in the face of overwhelming superiority the field marshal had burned his secret papers

973
01:46:15.14 --> 01:46:18.82
And that the generals lying behind their machine guns had fought to the end

974
01:46:20.18 --> 01:46:25.94
Furthermore after the catastrophe German magazines lied to the German people with faked pictures

975
01:46:26.02 --> 01:46:28.02
So showing such heroic scenes

976
01:46:29.22 --> 01:46:31.70
But the truth of the matter was something quite else

977
01:46:31.94 --> 01:46:38.50
We calculated that more than 15 generals and their staff said gone into captivity from the southern and central pockets

978
01:46:39.06 --> 01:46:43.70
Soon mosque soon the mosque our radio gave details of numbers and names

979
01:46:43.70 --> 01:46:50.18
I was only to learn later that some of these generals had gone into captivity with neatly packed suitcases and

980
01:46:50.58 --> 01:46:52.58
Plentiful baggage

981
01:46:52.98 --> 01:47:00.50
They simply stopped fighting and gave themselves up to the victor without any further consideration for the fate of the remaining battle groups

982
01:47:00.58 --> 01:47:07.30
The last request of the field marshal had been that the Russians should treat him as a private citizen

983
01:47:07.30 --> 01:47:13.38
With this he had resigned the official role he had formally played in the military political

984
01:47:13.94 --> 01:47:19.14
Interest of the Supreme Commander and as a broken man laid down as marshal ship

985
01:47:20.58 --> 01:47:27.22
He was driven away in a closed car and no longer needed to see the appalling misery of his sacrifice to army

986
01:47:32.02 --> 01:47:35.78
So there's no disconnect the troops on the ground were right

987
01:47:35.78 --> 01:47:40.58
These leaders were liars weak and

988
01:47:43.62 --> 01:47:45.62
They had no problem

989
01:47:48.10 --> 01:47:50.58
Persuing glory with someone else's ass

990
01:47:51.38 --> 01:47:53.38
But they weren't ready to do with their own

991
01:47:53.38 --> 01:48:03.46
Deep down inside I had increasingly begun to oppose certain military concepts of obedience

992
01:48:03.46 --> 01:48:10.42
Honor and discipline like those that had been manifesting themselves to the end in the measures taken by our command

993
01:48:12.50 --> 01:48:17.70
Was this only the so this is this week? We went through all this and he's like only now

994
01:48:17.70 --> 01:48:23.14
He's starting to oppose some of some of his his military concepts of obedience

995
01:48:24.42 --> 01:48:32.66
If this was an American the Americans are rebellious by nature like we don't you know if you're leading us down the wrong path

996
01:48:32.66 --> 01:48:36.42
We stand up and say like no you're not gonna do that stop no

997
01:48:38.42 --> 01:48:40.42
He's you know here going well

998
01:48:40.42 --> 01:48:47.86
They've done all this and only now am I starting to question these things and even questions his question back to the book

999
01:48:47.86 --> 01:48:57.86
Was this only the revolt of my selfish instinct for self preservation was an only an unsolgedly stance fear or cowardice at a time when things had become bitterly serious

1000
01:48:58.90 --> 01:49:01.38
Precisely at this point. I again remember the awkward

1001
01:49:02.02 --> 01:49:03.22
Deeply

1002
01:49:03.22 --> 01:49:09.70
Attraining thoughts and feelings with which I'd ask myself at the beginning of the war why and for whom must you make this sacrifice?

1003
01:49:11.94 --> 01:49:15.38
The same questions that had never really taken root rose again before me

1004
01:49:16.10 --> 01:49:21.70
Jagannically and applicable to the whole army was there really a noble high

1005
01:49:22.02 --> 01:49:26.82
Holy objective at stake here in Salon grad in our and in our battle and

1006
01:49:26.82 --> 01:49:33.78
And ethically justified goal which could be served by ultimate human human test of giving one's life

1007
01:49:35.22 --> 01:49:44.26
Did soldierly honor and obedience to orders really justify this demand so casually made of us that we hold out for this lost cause

1008
01:49:44.42 --> 01:49:47.54
This excess of suffering and dying was this

1009
01:49:47.54 --> 01:49:58.18
Immeasurable sacrifice really decisive for the outcome of the war and could it serve our country and our people?

1010
01:50:00.66 --> 01:50:04.42
This is what this is we want to know why we talk about the wild the time there it is

1011
01:50:05.46 --> 01:50:10.82
Now he should have been asking that question a long time ago and he said he started to in the beginning

1012
01:50:10.82 --> 01:50:14.66
He started to ask that question but he didn't go through with it. You know why because they were winning

1013
01:50:14.66 --> 01:50:22.02
They were winning. It's easy. Don't only need no why what I could go out there you know beat this country beat that country

1014
01:50:22.50 --> 01:50:24.50
Lowly that country. It's pretty easy

1015
01:50:24.98 --> 01:50:26.98
Not getting tested

1016
01:50:26.98 --> 01:50:31.86
Back to the book a foreboding I had long held grew into a terrible certainty

1017
01:50:32.10 --> 01:50:39.06
What was happening here in Salon grad was a tragic senseless self sacrifice a scarcely credible betrayal of the final

1018
01:50:39.06 --> 01:50:41.22
Commitment and devotion of brave soldiers

1019
01:50:41.22 --> 01:50:47.94
Our innocent trust had been misused in the most despicable manner by those responsible for the catastrophe

1020
01:50:48.34 --> 01:50:51.54
We had been betrayed let us stray and condemned

1021
01:50:53.22 --> 01:51:01.14
The men of Stalingrad were dying in betrayed belief and in betrayed trust in my heart the bitter feeling of and all for nothing

1022
01:51:01.70 --> 01:51:03.70
Became ever more torturing

1023
01:51:04.58 --> 01:51:09.30
In my soul arose again the whole of the disaster of the war itself

1024
01:51:09.30 --> 01:51:16.42
More clearly and ever I appreciated the full measure of misery and wretchedness of the other countries in Europe

1025
01:51:16.42 --> 01:51:23.86
To which German soldiers and German arms had brought boundless misfortunes or he's reflecting and he's looking around saying look what we did all these other countries

1026
01:51:24.98 --> 01:51:32.50
Had we not so far the victors been all too prone to close our eyes and our hearts and to forget that always and everywhere

1027
01:51:32.74 --> 01:51:37.62
The issues were living human beings their possessions and their happiness

1028
01:51:37.62 --> 01:51:42.66
So like you said he turned blind eye he rolled through all these countries he did all that evil

1029
01:51:44.74 --> 01:51:49.14
Probably only a few among us had entertained the thought of the suffer of the thought

1030
01:51:50.74 --> 01:51:57.62
That the suffering and dying being caused by our sorry profession of war would one day be inflicted upon us

1031
01:51:59.22 --> 01:52:05.14
We had carried our total war into one region of Europe after another and thereby

1032
01:52:05.14 --> 01:52:08.82
Destructively interfered with the destinies of foreign nations

1033
01:52:10.50 --> 01:52:13.78
far too little we had asked the reason why

1034
01:52:15.06 --> 01:52:19.70
Then the cestides and justifications for what was happening or reflected on the

1035
01:52:19.94 --> 01:52:24.02
Immerserability of our political responsibility that these entailed

1036
01:52:25.30 --> 01:52:31.30
Misery and death had been initiated by us and now we were inexorably

1037
01:52:31.30 --> 01:52:39.22
Coming home to roost they were inexorably coming home to roost the step on the dawn and the vulga

1038
01:52:39.78 --> 01:52:42.90
Head drunk streams of precious human blood

1039
01:52:44.82 --> 01:52:50.66
The Russians were certainly also making cruelly high blood sacrifices in the murderous battle of Stalin

1040
01:52:50.66 --> 01:52:56.58
God, but they who were defending their country against a foreign aggressor knew better than

1041
01:52:56.58 --> 01:53:02.50
We why they were risking their lives so yeah the Russians they're fighting they're dying for sure

1042
01:53:02.50 --> 01:53:06.10
But they know that they're defending their homeland. It's a lot easier for them to understand

1043
01:53:08.18 --> 01:53:11.62
Many officers and commanders now began to oppose the insane orders

1044
01:53:12.50 --> 01:53:20.26
Aminating from the fear ahead quarters and being passed on by army command by this they had they began to reject the long eroded military

1045
01:53:20.42 --> 01:53:24.34
Concepts of honor and discipline to which the army leadership had clung until the end

1046
01:53:24.34 --> 01:53:31.22
In the unconditional obedience such such as was fadely being upheld here in Stalin, God

1047
01:53:31.54 --> 01:53:36.10
There was no longer a soldierly stance, but rather a lack of responsibility

1048
01:53:39.30 --> 01:53:43.86
To say that one more time this idea that unconditional obedience

1049
01:53:45.22 --> 01:53:47.22
Was was

1050
01:53:47.22 --> 01:53:53.46
Was not seen right now as a soldierly stance but a lack of responsibility because you are responsible

1051
01:53:53.46 --> 01:53:59.14
To do something if if you're getting bad orders you're responsible for not obeying them

1052
01:53:59.14 --> 01:54:03.54
And you know I get asked this question all the time not all the time, but you know sometimes

1053
01:54:03.94 --> 01:54:05.54
People say what if you got it?

1054
01:54:05.54 --> 01:54:08.42
We know what did you do if you ever got told something that you didn't believe it?

1055
01:54:08.42 --> 01:54:09.62
I was like well

1056
01:54:09.62 --> 01:54:11.62
We were home the same page like

1057
01:54:12.26 --> 01:54:16.98
It's not like we were getting told to do things that were immoral unethical

1058
01:54:17.62 --> 01:54:20.66
You know they weren't saying hey go burn this village with women and children in it

1059
01:54:20.66 --> 01:54:24.90
We weren't getting those orders he don't I mean we weren't getting told to do things that

1060
01:54:27.30 --> 01:54:33.38
That weren't that I didn't agree with that my guys didn't agree with and then that's the way the milk like are there

1061
01:54:34.02 --> 01:54:38.50
Other pockets where things happen? Yeah, absolutely that's what that's the horrors of war

1062
01:54:40.58 --> 01:54:44.82
But if we got told to do things that we didn't think we should do we were to said no not doing it

1063
01:54:44.82 --> 01:54:46.82
Hmm

1064
01:54:48.90 --> 01:54:50.90
This was open mutiny

1065
01:54:51.22 --> 01:54:56.26
So they've gotten to the point now finally since there were no more errors from the center towards the end many

1066
01:54:56.26 --> 01:55:00.34
Responsible commanders and unit leaders on the line acted on their own initiative and in a

1067
01:55:00.34 --> 01:55:02.90
Devar to stop the senseless shedding of blood

1068
01:55:03.46 --> 01:55:10.58
Many desperate stolen grout warriors in the end sought away out by suicide or by voluntary by a voluntary soldiers death

1069
01:55:10.58 --> 01:55:18.98
We learned of two general suit streams whose extreme resolution had been shattering won the commander of a division from Dresden had shot himself

1070
01:55:18.98 --> 01:55:23.62
After having ordered his son a young lieutenant to report to him to save farewell

1071
01:55:24.82 --> 01:55:31.14
The other the commander of a division from lower Saxony whose tactical emblem was a four leaf cloven was known

1072
01:55:31.14 --> 01:55:39.78
Therefore as the lucky division who did not want to survive the downfall of his men had been killed on the front line while standing erect and firing his weapon

1073
01:55:48.42 --> 01:55:54.74
The last pockets of resistance what was left about six shattered divisions and the remnant of other

1074
01:55:54.74 --> 01:56:01.94
Formations that had mean while been left to their fate by the resignation of the army command now had to bear the whole burden of the concentrated

1075
01:56:01.94 --> 01:56:04.74
Erotax artillery and mortar fire

1076
01:56:08.58 --> 01:56:16.26
It was not only the fear of the coming end the hunger clawing at my intestines and the pain from my frozen limbs that turned the last

1077
01:56:16.42 --> 01:56:20.98
Seemingly endless hours in the stolen grout pocket into the torches of hell for me

1078
01:56:20.98 --> 01:56:24.02
The proximity of death

1079
01:56:25.06 --> 01:56:32.02
Torred the last obscuring veils from my eyes and brought fruits of long years of individual experience as

1080
01:56:32.18 --> 01:56:36.74
Observations tormenting feelings and thoughts into an instant maturity

1081
01:56:38.58 --> 01:56:43.62
Now on the very edge of being war in its for us

1082
01:56:43.62 --> 01:56:52.18
Most terrible form became the inexorable revealer of all things

1083
01:56:53.94 --> 01:56:59.30
He's going through like spiritual awakening as he faces death in my minds

1084
01:56:59.30 --> 01:57:04.82
I the horrible experiences and pictures of destruction that would not leave me in peace by day or night

1085
01:57:05.14 --> 01:57:07.14
We're strong together in a bloody chain

1086
01:57:07.14 --> 01:57:13.62
Experience as an impression stretching far into the past that suddenly awoke in my sharp and memory

1087
01:57:13.62 --> 01:57:17.54
I discovered to be logically connected links of this fatal chain

1088
01:57:18.82 --> 01:57:23.22
What had formerly always caused me to have nasty premonitions and apprehensions

1089
01:57:23.62 --> 01:57:25.46
What had always disquited me?

1090
01:57:25.46 --> 01:57:32.50
I now suddenly had to recognize as having been the warning of a fatal fundamental evil

1091
01:57:32.50 --> 01:57:37.46
The dimensions of which I had fought not fought possible

1092
01:57:46.26 --> 01:57:47.54
Now

1093
01:57:47.54 --> 01:57:50.26
faced with the eminently impending catastrophe

1094
01:57:50.74 --> 01:57:57.54
Requestion about the sense of what was happening it played me so often during the war seized me again with cruel force

1095
01:57:57.54 --> 01:58:04.58
Hundreds of thousands of flowering human lives were suddenly being senselessly snuffed out here in Stalingrad

1096
01:58:05.46 --> 01:58:17.06
What an immeasurable wealth of human happiness human plans hopes talents fertile possibilities for the future were there by being destroyed forever

1097
01:58:18.42 --> 01:58:20.10
The criminal

1098
01:58:20.10 --> 01:58:26.82
Insanity of an irresponsible war management with its superstitious belief in technology and its

1099
01:58:26.82 --> 01:58:35.46
Under lack of feeling for the life value and dignity of man and here prepared for us a hell on earth

1100
01:58:41.30 --> 01:58:46.02
How could the long-eroded concepts of honor, duty, obedience, soldier,

1101
01:58:46.02 --> 01:58:50.18
Lehair wisdom figure any longer into our feelings thoughts and actions

1102
01:58:50.18 --> 01:59:00.82
To stay alive to be reunited once again with our loved ones at home this burning desire was now the drive behind all thoughts and actions

1103
01:59:02.34 --> 01:59:04.34
Gradually

1104
01:59:04.34 --> 01:59:12.50
We had a customer ourselves to the to the idea of surrendering at the first opportunity and going into Russian captivity

1105
01:59:12.50 --> 01:59:21.22
In the end I basically had only one wish to stay alive and healthy and going to captivity unwinded

1106
01:59:22.50 --> 01:59:24.50
So that's it goes into captivity

1107
01:59:26.18 --> 01:59:28.18
You know after going through a

1108
01:59:29.46 --> 01:59:33.54
I don't know if you want to call it a spiritual awakening of recognizing that his whole life

1109
01:59:34.50 --> 01:59:36.10
had been

1110
01:59:36.10 --> 01:59:46.02
Doing something evil yeah in the it's it's pretty anti climatic how it happens

1111
01:59:47.06 --> 01:59:50.10
How they get how they end up in captivity

1112
01:59:51.30 --> 01:59:55.54
Back to the book in the early minutes of captivity. I felt an easing tension and and relief

1113
01:59:56.58 --> 02:00:02.58
In the end the insecurity of our situation between life and death had weighed down on all of us like lead

1114
02:00:02.58 --> 02:00:10.34
What first attracted my attention so now they're captured what first attracted my attention imagine this

1115
02:00:11.54 --> 02:00:14.50
Was the fresh healthy appearance of the victors?

1116
02:00:15.46 --> 02:00:18.98
They're simple enviable winter clothing and good weapons

1117
02:00:18.98 --> 02:00:23.70
Sun sub machine guns everywhere and the uniform picture of sheep skins

1118
02:00:24.10 --> 02:00:29.22
Patted jackets felt boots and fur caps with broad earmuffs swinging up and down

1119
02:00:29.22 --> 02:00:38.82
The warmly bundled up well merged and splendidly equipped men of the red army with their chunky mostly red sheet faces

1120
02:00:39.30 --> 02:00:43.22
Formed a stark contrast to our death-free pale filthy

1121
02:00:43.54 --> 02:00:49.70
Bearded and freezing figures of misery who hung exhausted and sick and they're makes shift winter clothing

1122
02:00:50.02 --> 02:00:56.90
Consisting of all kinds of fur's blanket scarfs field gray head gear wounds and inadequate foot gear

1123
02:00:56.90 --> 02:01:07.54
This sudden meeting and comparison at once showed me how low we had sunk and how little we had been prepared for this murderous battle

1124
02:01:10.82 --> 02:01:14.50
Then the Soviets kind of the Russians kind of have their

1125
02:01:15.62 --> 02:01:19.30
Shots at him fritzy fascist Hitler kaput

1126
02:01:19.30 --> 02:01:26.90
They alternated threats and obviously dreadful curses and contemptuous spit

1127
02:01:27.86 --> 02:01:37.30
Like raging wolfs, vengeful soldiers from the rear echelons fell on the helpless victims time and time again to steal personal baggage and event their spleen

1128
02:01:39.22 --> 02:01:43.78
So now they're captured and the the Russians start to kind of sing and dance and and

1129
02:01:45.38 --> 02:01:47.38
sing and old folk songs

1130
02:01:47.38 --> 02:01:56.50
Back to the book all the noise and exuberance surrounding me formed a shrieking contrast to the inner and outer state which I found myself

1131
02:01:57.70 --> 02:02:04.02
Torn for my circle of comrades left to myself and my emotions in the midst of the joyful dancing and singing

1132
02:02:04.02 --> 02:02:08.50
Victors with whom no contact could be established in my inner heart

1133
02:02:08.50 --> 02:02:12.10
I felt abandoned and without hope totally depressed

1134
02:02:12.10 --> 02:02:19.22
Upluted cut off from home sunk far away subjugated to a foreign will pitously

1135
02:02:19.78 --> 02:02:20.82
Pityously

1136
02:02:20.82 --> 02:02:23.78
thrown to the mercy of an unknown powers

1137
02:02:25.22 --> 02:02:31.62
To be dependent on the whim of the victor constantly watched menacingly surrounded by barbed wire and guns

1138
02:02:32.10 --> 02:02:36.26
forced to relinquish any kind of external freedom captivity men

1139
02:02:36.90 --> 02:02:39.30
an unknown form of

1140
02:02:39.70 --> 02:02:41.30
human submission

1141
02:02:41.30 --> 02:02:43.30
and humiliation

1142
02:02:47.14 --> 02:02:57.46
It is a bounty for us human beings that a merciful hand covers the future from our eyes with an impenetrable veil

1143
02:02:58.82 --> 02:03:00.82
That's a really great line

1144
02:03:01.78 --> 02:03:06.50
Had I known then that I was destined for more than seven

1145
02:03:06.50 --> 02:03:15.38
Comfortless years devoid of love and filled with previously unknown mental and physical tortures and fearful uncertainties

1146
02:03:15.54 --> 02:03:17.30
On the borderline of life

1147
02:03:17.54 --> 02:03:24.26
I never would have found the strength to stand the sufferings of the initial hard months of captivity

1148
02:03:25.54 --> 02:03:29.78
He's saying if you would have known what the future held seven years he's about to be in captivity for

1149
02:03:32.90 --> 02:03:34.90
He wouldn't have even made it through

1150
02:03:34.90 --> 02:03:36.90
He would have given up

1151
02:03:39.14 --> 02:03:41.14
and

1152
02:03:41.14 --> 02:03:43.14
he doesn't

1153
02:03:42.98 --> 02:03:45.70
Talk in this book about what that

1154
02:03:47.38 --> 02:03:49.38
In prison was like

1155
02:03:50.02 --> 02:03:52.66
But he does give what I think

1156
02:03:53.78 --> 02:03:58.18
Is a combination of how we survived it and what he learned from it going back to the book

1157
02:03:58.90 --> 02:04:00.42
time and again

1158
02:04:00.42 --> 02:04:11.94
I was soothingly distracted from my tormenting thoughts and dark visions by the wonders of the brightly shining star filled winter sky that appeared to be so close to the touch

1159
02:04:12.98 --> 02:04:16.58
It constantly drew my eyes upwards as if by magical force

1160
02:04:17.78 --> 02:04:25.22
What it so far appeared to me as the downfall of a world come loose at the seams and a catastrophe without bounds

1161
02:04:25.22 --> 02:04:29.54
Suddenly took on measurable dimensions I

1162
02:04:30.82 --> 02:04:34.90
Regained my equilibrium and found my way back to myself

1163
02:04:36.50 --> 02:04:42.98
Or I had felt earlier that chaos was swallowing me up now calm and peace was flowing into my

1164
02:04:43.14 --> 02:04:45.14
Disquited heart

1165
02:04:45.14 --> 02:04:54.90
The reconciling effect came from the vast order and harmony that the sparkling mass of bright stars with their eternal walls of the universe

1166
02:04:55.46 --> 02:04:57.46
brought back to my attention a new

1167
02:05:00.58 --> 02:05:06.34
The consolation that the stars sank into my soul was strange and hardly to be grasped by the intellect

1168
02:05:07.78 --> 02:05:12.58
It seemed to me as if my personal fate within the framework of events on earth

1169
02:05:12.58 --> 02:05:17.86
Was secretly included within the vast all embracing order of the cosmos

1170
02:05:20.02 --> 02:05:23.70
For the mass of survivors who had escaped from the hell of Stalin-Grad

1171
02:05:24.42 --> 02:05:27.86
The aftermath of the tragedy lasted only for a short while

1172
02:05:29.38 --> 02:05:33.94
They died in their tens of thousands during the early months of captivity

1173
02:05:35.14 --> 02:05:37.14
Hunger and deprivation

1174
02:05:37.14 --> 02:05:41.22
Frost and sickness had already made them a sure prey for death

1175
02:05:41.22 --> 02:05:43.22
Even before the fighting stopped

1176
02:05:44.82 --> 02:05:49.94
With the columns of prisoners death also came to the various camps of reception

1177
02:05:50.10 --> 02:05:53.38
We're terrible epidemics raged everywhere

1178
02:05:54.58 --> 02:05:57.46
An exact accounting of the victims of Stalin-Grad

1179
02:05:58.18 --> 02:06:03.06
According to numbers dates and individual fates will never be made

1180
02:06:03.06 --> 02:06:11.22
The few that were allowed to begin a new life at home and in freedom after long years of captivity

1181
02:06:11.54 --> 02:06:18.10
Will always have to ask themselves how they can justify the deaths of the others by their own existence

1182
02:06:18.98 --> 02:06:22.90
How they can uphold and fulfill the legacy of their dead comrades

1183
02:06:24.50 --> 02:06:32.42
But all Germany must also loyally remember its many many sons that lie at rest in the distant Russian step

1184
02:06:32.42 --> 02:06:38.42
And try today and in the future to understand their unforgettable sacrifice

1185
02:06:40.34 --> 02:06:45.94
The innumerable mounds of soldiers graves and Stalin-Grad have long disappeared

1186
02:06:47.22 --> 02:06:52.90
The cemeteries were leviled soon after the battle and partially converted to soccer fields

1187
02:06:54.82 --> 02:06:58.50
Nothing is left of the army of simple gray crosses

1188
02:06:58.50 --> 02:07:05.38
But it is as if a great invisible cross were rising

1189
02:07:06.34 --> 02:07:08.34
There on the vulga

1190
02:07:08.74 --> 02:07:14.42
Casting its shadow over our nation and addressing penetrating

1191
02:07:15.38 --> 02:07:17.38
Admonishing words

1192
02:07:18.90 --> 02:07:20.90
To all of our hearts

1193
02:07:20.90 --> 02:07:27.94
And that

1194
02:07:30.98 --> 02:07:33.94
Closes out this book with

1195
02:07:37.62 --> 02:07:38.82
Some

1196
02:07:41.38 --> 02:07:47.38
penetrating and admonishing words for us because there's a lot of warnings

1197
02:07:47.38 --> 02:07:51.06
In this book warnings that

1198
02:07:53.54 --> 02:07:55.78
We must pay attention to

1199
02:07:59.70 --> 02:08:01.86
And if we don't pay attention to them then who will?

1200
02:08:04.10 --> 02:08:08.18
Warnings the lessons here first of all as a nation

1201
02:08:08.18 --> 02:08:15.14
As a culture we have to look at the way things fell apart in Germany

1202
02:08:17.46 --> 02:08:24.10
Or maybe you look at the way things came together slowly like we talked about the traditional values were

1203
02:08:25.06 --> 02:08:33.06
We're moved aside and they were replaced with these new values values that allegedly protected the German citizens

1204
02:08:33.06 --> 02:08:39.22
They were values that were going to make the world a better place

1205
02:08:41.86 --> 02:08:44.90
And he uses this term this political religion

1206
02:08:47.06 --> 02:08:48.26
That's a powerful thought

1207
02:08:50.58 --> 02:08:59.22
Political religion took hold and then he used that term presumptuous beliefs that countered the foundation

1208
02:08:59.22 --> 02:09:07.70
Of their existing cultures and beliefs so there's some arrogance involved that we have people that aren't even listening to the counter arguments

1209
02:09:10.26 --> 02:09:14.58
I think we have to be careful

1210
02:09:16.18 --> 02:09:18.18
not to abandon

1211
02:09:18.18 --> 02:09:28.10
The structures of the past in some kind of a race to move to the future because the future it hasn't been tested

1212
02:09:29.62 --> 02:09:35.14
By thousands and thousands of years of human evolution and I understand

1213
02:09:37.62 --> 02:09:39.62
That we

1214
02:09:40.74 --> 02:09:42.34
I'm not saying we don't progress

1215
02:09:42.34 --> 02:09:48.50
If I'm not saying we don't evolve but I'm saying you don't bow down and you don't submit

1216
02:09:52.98 --> 02:10:04.90
You got to think about the direction that we're heading and as citizens as people we have to have the courage to stand up before we reach the event horizon from which there's no return

1217
02:10:04.90 --> 02:10:10.74
So now on a smaller level

1218
02:10:11.94 --> 02:10:18.74
Lessons from this book as a as a person in business or in the military or in any team as a subordinate

1219
02:10:19.46 --> 02:10:20.98
And we're all subordinate to someone

1220
02:10:22.82 --> 02:10:27.30
We have to question our leaders and and I say that all the time

1221
02:10:29.46 --> 02:10:33.94
If we don't agree with a plan or don't agree with a tactic you got a question your leadership and you got to

1222
02:10:33.94 --> 02:10:40.98
Raise your hand, but if we know that the intent of our leadership is malevolent

1223
02:10:43.78 --> 02:10:49.14
Or it's gonna cause suffering human suffering on a grand scale or on a minor scale

1224
02:10:51.70 --> 02:10:53.70
You have to

1225
02:10:54.26 --> 02:10:59.54
We have to say no and do what is right no matter the consequence

1226
02:10:59.54 --> 02:11:04.98
No matter the consequence

1227
02:11:08.58 --> 02:11:10.58
And

1228
02:11:10.58 --> 02:11:12.58
You know finally

1229
02:11:13.22 --> 02:11:15.22
For us as

1230
02:11:15.86 --> 02:11:17.86
Individuals

1231
02:11:20.10 --> 02:11:23.06
We gotta remember that we are in charge of our own lives

1232
02:11:23.06 --> 02:11:29.54
We are leading our own lives and where are you leading yourself

1233
02:11:32.82 --> 02:11:38.02
What are you doing that you know you shouldn't be doing why are you doing that?

1234
02:11:40.18 --> 02:11:43.22
What catastrophe are you heading toward?

1235
02:11:43.22 --> 02:11:55.46
You don't have to be heading towards that catastrophe you have the opportunity to prevent catastrophe in your own life

1236
02:11:55.46 --> 02:12:00.50
But in order to do that once again you have to stand up you have to do the right thing

1237
02:12:03.86 --> 02:12:06.50
You have to be uncomfortable

1238
02:12:06.50 --> 02:12:13.46
You have to impose the discipline on your own life

1239
02:12:14.50 --> 02:12:23.38
So you don't have something else imposed something bad in post so you don't have a catastrophe imposed on your own life

1240
02:12:28.42 --> 02:12:33.30
Because when we avoid the discomfort and when we avoid the discipline and when we avoid

1241
02:12:33.30 --> 02:12:42.18
Doing what we know is the right thing to do that's when you end up in a personal catastrophe in your own personal hell in your own personal

1242
02:12:42.66 --> 02:12:44.66
Stalin grud

1243
02:12:48.74 --> 02:12:50.74
You have to do

1244
02:12:51.46 --> 02:12:55.30
The hard thing the thing you know is right and

1245
02:12:55.30 --> 02:13:01.86
And you know what is right and you know what you are supposed to do

1246
02:13:04.50 --> 02:13:06.50
So do it and

1247
02:13:07.38 --> 02:13:11.14
Avoid going down a path

1248
02:13:13.38 --> 02:13:15.38
That leads

1249
02:13:17.62 --> 02:13:19.62
To your own personal hell

1250
02:13:21.06 --> 02:13:23.06
And instead

1251
02:13:23.06 --> 02:13:25.94
Get on the path that leads

1252
02:13:28.66 --> 02:13:30.66
To freedom

1253
02:13:32.02 --> 02:13:34.02
And I think

1254
02:13:34.98 --> 02:13:41.38
That's all I've got for tonight's so echo speaking of doing the right thing sure

1255
02:13:42.58 --> 02:13:44.58
Maybe you could give us some ideas

1256
02:13:45.86 --> 02:13:47.86
on how

1257
02:13:47.86 --> 02:13:53.14
We can you know continue down the right path doing what we know we're supposed to do

1258
02:13:54.50 --> 02:13:56.50
Sure

1259
02:13:56.98 --> 02:14:04.50
The part where you said you know you're less likely to raise any questions or you're more likely to turn a blind eye

1260
02:14:04.98 --> 02:14:06.50
When you're winning

1261
02:14:06.50 --> 02:14:08.50
Remember you said that

1262
02:14:08.50 --> 02:14:10.74
Like on the one year see boiler room

1263
02:14:10.74 --> 02:14:12.74
I mean, no, no, you're right

1264
02:14:12.74 --> 02:14:17.94
You see that weather yeah, so the guys there's a part where he's in that they're waiting to go to a party

1265
02:14:18.50 --> 02:14:24.02
Something you know they're they're selling stocks right and they're like garbage stocks or whatever inflating them

1266
02:14:24.34 --> 02:14:27.54
Yeah, they're like yeah, there's some so pump a dump

1267
02:14:28.18 --> 02:14:30.98
Yeah, and so they're in the car

1268
02:14:31.62 --> 02:14:35.54
Going to some party and he's like hey, it was what's it Giovanni group that whatever that

1269
02:14:35.54 --> 02:14:42.26
Disney's name's there. He's like hey, do you ever wonder how how we get these big commissions on these you know

1270
02:14:42.26 --> 02:14:46.82
So I mean he's like that's the wrong question to ask you know he's like wait what do you mean he's like

1271
02:14:47.14 --> 02:14:50.74
He's like just just don't ask that question basics. He said don't ask that question

1272
02:14:50.74 --> 02:14:52.26
It was don't you like the way things are going

1273
02:14:52.26 --> 02:14:59.14
He's like yeah, but I do I do but don't you ever wonder he's like no I like being a millionaire same exact thing when you're winning

1274
02:14:59.14 --> 02:15:01.14
It's easy to turn the blind eye

1275
02:15:02.82 --> 02:15:05.78
Good point yeah, man, so I mean I guess that can apply

1276
02:15:05.78 --> 02:15:09.46
Well, yeah, you know it's it's interesting that you point that out and I think that

1277
02:15:09.46 --> 02:15:13.78
Um like on a personal level, right? Let's say you're doing really good

1278
02:15:13.78 --> 02:15:18.90
Yeah, it's then it can be tricky for people to do the right thing. Yeah, too because that's why we see like these

1279
02:15:19.94 --> 02:15:24.02
Celebrity like movie stars or celebrity athletes or whatever

1280
02:15:24.42 --> 02:15:28.66
Man, they do some dumb stuff right they do some dumps like they're winning

1281
02:15:28.66 --> 02:15:31.94
They're thinking they're good. They're good. They do whatever they want yeah, they make their wrong choice

1282
02:15:32.50 --> 02:15:37.38
Yeah, even they're on the evening news doing dumb stuff that ruins them yeah

1283
02:15:37.38 --> 02:15:45.46
And then their own personal style grud. Yeah, yeah, yeah, even yeah with money too, you know, you know like and celebrity types and you know

1284
02:15:45.46 --> 02:15:47.46
Athlete who even just people people

1285
02:15:47.46 --> 02:15:51.06
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they're business blows up or whatever

1286
02:15:52.02 --> 02:15:56.58
Yeah, I guess any any any type of winning we could look at yeah

1287
02:15:56.58 --> 02:15:58.58
It doesn't mean you're necessarily doing the right thing

1288
02:15:58.58 --> 02:16:01.54
Yeah, it's harder my point is and I think you're saying the same thing

1289
02:16:01.54 --> 02:16:03.54
Yes, it can be harder. Yeah

1290
02:16:03.86 --> 02:16:06.90
Did do the right thing when you're winning because you just think you're yeah

1291
02:16:06.90 --> 02:16:11.86
Good to go you get arrogant. Yeah. Yeah. Let's not let's not put breaks on this training here

1292
02:16:11.86 --> 02:16:13.62
Just let it all fly kind of thing

1293
02:16:13.62 --> 02:16:19.38
Yeah, and then when the train kind of loses momentum mean while all those those things that you've been ignoring they're still there

1294
02:16:19.70 --> 02:16:21.78
Hey, you know, look at your empty bank account

1295
02:16:21.78 --> 02:16:26.58
You spent all that money you're supposed to keep before you made budget you know our money you were budgeting

1296
02:16:26.58 --> 02:16:31.06
Right you're budgeting you're surviving your budgeting you're doing the sort of making all this money started spanning all this money

1297
02:16:31.46 --> 02:16:33.46
Well the money stopped coming in your budget

1298
02:16:33.46 --> 02:16:35.46
God

1299
02:16:35.46 --> 02:16:38.74
See that's what happens sometimes you can't happen. Yeah

1300
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.38
Also pain now or pay later. I remember that one. That was a good one that you said

1301
02:16:44.82 --> 02:16:49.86
Yeah, did I say that yeah paying now or pay later? We're I think we're talking about like working out or something

1302
02:16:49.86 --> 02:16:53.22
Oh, yeah, I was like I didn't say today though. No, no, no, no, no, yeah

1303
02:16:53.22 --> 02:16:55.46
Yeah, pay now or pay later for sure stuff with me

1304
02:16:55.94 --> 02:16:58.74
nonetheless support yeah for sure 100%

1305
02:16:59.30 --> 02:17:01.30
good way to

1306
02:17:01.30 --> 02:17:06.66
Avoid going down your personal and I don't know maybe does maybe doesn't nonetheless have you in the mood to support you don't have

1307
02:17:06.66 --> 02:17:10.10
In your own personal style and rock yeah, right, but I don't know why

1308
02:17:10.82 --> 02:17:16.98
Supporting would like prevent that you know, yeah, no, no, we got preaching pretty deep for

1309
02:17:17.46 --> 02:17:20.50
But nonetheless, you don't know you don't have any a version to reach a date

1310
02:17:21.70 --> 02:17:25.46
You're reaching deep today. This one is too much style and grog training day

1311
02:17:25.46 --> 02:17:32.58
No, no, those were conceptually they were the same thing they were I know the compare it's you know

1312
02:17:33.86 --> 02:17:39.70
Most of these world most of these like lessons I think I feel like they're kind of everywhere

1313
02:17:39.70 --> 02:17:44.98
Yeah, of course, and you know you talk about these heavy wars and heavy like events and then you know in my mind

1314
02:17:44.98 --> 02:17:46.98
I'm thinking training

1315
02:17:49.22 --> 02:17:54.10
You know what the you know the idea still hates the same there's I think there's people out there

1316
02:17:54.10 --> 02:18:01.62
In various states of mind sure and I think that you know your perspective helps them maybe get

1317
02:18:02.50 --> 02:18:07.70
Maybe see some of them saying because maybe I'm I'm heading them from the wrong angle so yeah, you're coming in from training day

1318
02:18:08.26 --> 02:18:15.62
Movies and yeah, actually and then come to think about it these concepts right here today when you're saying you know

1319
02:18:16.10 --> 02:18:19.78
You know when it's going to take for example when it's going good it's easy to turn the blind

1320
02:18:19.78 --> 02:18:25.46
Isn't that kind of a lot of movies how it is it's like the guy does real good and he's just kind of going and

1321
02:18:26.26 --> 02:18:28.74
He messes up in one way or another

1322
02:18:28.74 --> 02:18:33.62
Yeah, I think there's a talk by Kurt Vonnegut and I've seen you on YouTube

1323
02:18:33.62 --> 02:18:35.94
I think it's Kurt Vonnegut. He's a teaching a class

1324
02:18:35.94 --> 02:18:37.38
You know Kurt Vonnegut is yeah

1325
02:18:37.38 --> 02:18:43.06
He's teaching some class like he just guessed teaching in some class pretty awesome, but he's talking about like there's four

1326
02:18:43.86 --> 02:18:46.66
Plot lines and they're all pretty much this. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool

1327
02:18:46.66 --> 02:18:51.30
But that's one of your you have nothing and then you get everything yeah

1328
02:18:51.30 --> 02:18:57.02
I think I abuse it kind of there's then there's you have nothing you get everything you lose everything and then you get everything back

1329
02:18:57.02 --> 02:19:01.98
He's just got these it's like I forget them all, but yeah, yeah, they're common

1330
02:19:03.62 --> 02:19:08.68
Common story line yeah, they must be kind of I mean they must be right based on real life like like

1331
02:19:08.68 --> 02:19:18.06
Term like scenarios that you go through well, I think it's why it's like come back story. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1332
02:19:18.06 --> 02:19:21.82
Your dog store under dog. Yeah, triumphant. Yeah, that's all

1333
02:19:22.30 --> 02:19:24.30
On the last of year in the mood to support

1334
02:19:26.10 --> 02:19:29.98
And you know between your movie watching Escapades

1335
02:19:30.82 --> 02:19:36.20
Is that the correct word escapades? Yeah, yeah, I don't recommend it. I recommend you read

1336
02:19:36.20 --> 02:19:39.40
You know whatever train day maybe we'll get you there

1337
02:19:40.52 --> 02:19:42.62
That's a good I thought anyway nonetheless

1338
02:19:43.24 --> 02:19:48.28
Origin made isn't it weird that like training day is this movie that call how much the cost to make training day?

1339
02:19:48.28 --> 02:19:51.94
I don't know 50 million dollars and like you can go to the library and get stolen by the book

1340
02:19:52.84 --> 02:19:55.70
For nothing literally nothing. Yeah, or you can buy it

1341
02:19:56.40 --> 02:20:02.80
You can buy it on Amazon for I think this book costs like a dollar because it's used

1342
02:20:02.80 --> 02:20:09.52
But it's just kind of a strange dichotomy there. It's interesting for sure and you know

1343
02:20:09.52 --> 02:20:12.000
Obviously we can go into why which one is better for you?

1344
02:20:12.40 --> 02:20:15.44
I'm gonna go ahead and say that's telling me what's better for you than training day. Oh

1345
02:20:15.44 --> 02:20:18.36
It depends on what you get out of it, you know, you know, I like I mean

1346
02:20:18.36 --> 02:20:22.04
That's actually people would ask me how do you read to get the most out of it?

1347
02:20:22.44 --> 02:20:26.94
Out of a book. How do you? Well, I read it while I'm reading it. I lied it. Oh, yeah

1348
02:20:26.94 --> 02:20:30.08
Jordan B. Peterson. I was watching something that you had to say don't highlight anything

1349
02:20:30.08 --> 02:20:37.64
Yeah, this is the this I have a major disagreement with Jordan B. Peterson. I'm not highlighting full

1350
02:20:38.28 --> 02:20:39.28
But

1351
02:20:39.28 --> 02:20:48.40
Anyway, so I go through I highlight what hits me and then I go back and reread it and then I have the red pen to circle the important really

1352
02:20:48.40 --> 02:20:51.72
That's what I do to on the Kindle it you can choose your

1353
02:20:51.72 --> 02:20:58.96
Your color of highlighter. So the yellow is general highlighting and then the orange. Yeah, that's not it

1354
02:21:00.36 --> 02:21:04.24
Nonetheless, all right. Well, how about this we'll talk about some jujitsu geese

1355
02:21:05.72 --> 02:21:07.40
Because people asked me yeah

1356
02:21:07.92 --> 02:21:13.60
What geese should I get you get origin geese? That's it. In America from the threats from the cotton

1357
02:21:14.08 --> 02:21:16.08
As always say as we all know

1358
02:21:16.08 --> 02:21:21.66
Being a mayor to the shirt dirt to the shirt. Have you said that field to finish? No, I just was up there

1359
02:21:21.66 --> 02:21:25.80
I was just up at the factory with Pete. Oh, yeah, I caught the Facebook like I don't know my head

1360
02:21:25.80 --> 02:21:28.04
I'm a my dirt to this show is that to you right?

1361
02:21:28.04 --> 02:21:30.44
I think it might be just like yeah

1362
02:21:31.08 --> 02:21:36.72
To shirt might be field to finish hands in daylight hands in daylight

1363
02:21:38.08 --> 02:21:42.72
But yeah, it makes some good stuff especially geese in America like I said

1364
02:21:43.28 --> 02:21:45.28
good

1365
02:21:45.28 --> 02:21:48.32
In jujitsu, you know, I have a few geese

1366
02:21:48.96 --> 02:21:53.28
If you geese, I don't need use any of them except the origin ones. Go to originmain.com

1367
02:21:53.28 --> 02:21:59.64
That's where you can get your geese for jujitsu. They also have rash cards compression gear right and that's for jujitsu

1368
02:21:59.64 --> 02:22:00.64
I think

1369
02:22:00.64 --> 02:22:02.32
primarily

1370
02:22:02.32 --> 02:22:09.24
But you can use it for other stuff of course. Yeah, indeed big tent also

1371
02:22:09.24 --> 02:22:16.04

Five o'clock in the afternoon he's looking back at it. I hold on. Be right back and take some joy of warfare

1386
02:23:17.08 --> 02:23:22.92
So he's that like he's at the threshold. Yeah, he's like that kind of he's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's uh

1387
02:23:22.92 --> 02:23:25.80
Yeah, and that's actually it's interesting because you know you can see

1388
02:23:27.24 --> 02:23:30.84
What's selling and what's cool is you can see during warfare

1389
02:23:30.84 --> 02:23:35.32
Crilloil like what's awesome about is it to repeat customers of people that order it

1390
02:23:35.32 --> 02:23:39.88
Yeah, then they order it again and then they order it again. Yeah, because you don't order it if you're not feeling it

1391
02:23:39.88 --> 02:23:42.20
Yeah, that's what I'm that's how I am with the krilloil yeah

1392
02:23:42.20 --> 02:23:46.84
100% like if you like offer get and I'll be like you know like oh, I'll take it later

1393
02:23:46.84 --> 02:23:48.84
I don't forget and yeah, you know

1394
02:23:48.84 --> 02:23:51.96
You're just you have don't you have a morning routine

1395
02:23:51.96 --> 02:23:56.84
I don't whatever and that's the thing that's the thing doesn't include just wake up boom boom

1396
02:23:56.84 --> 02:24:02.68
For me medicine cabinet opened my all my stuff is right there. No, and not to go to deep to deep into my routine

1397
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.52
But during the week it's you know wake up and then there's like my daughters for and half

1398
02:24:08.52 --> 02:24:12.68
She has school so there's that situation going on this is not this does not

1399
02:24:13.40 --> 02:24:18.68
In your fear with you getting up and taking some pills for before you brush your teeth kind of not see

1400
02:24:18.68 --> 02:24:23.16
That's the thing the routine doesn't allow for me to take them before I've actually it's part

1401
02:24:23.16 --> 02:24:27.72
It's the routine it's the routine for the other team because for me after you got it you got it

1402
02:24:27.72 --> 02:24:31.72
You got to take the pills before you brush your teeth because when you brush your teeth you got the strong

1403
02:24:31.72 --> 02:24:37.16
Men in there that makes the water like too cold in your teeth. Yes, and I like that. I think it's more refreshing

1404
02:24:37.16 --> 02:24:38.04
I don't see

1405
02:24:38.04 --> 02:24:40.04
Maybe I need to harden up a little bit

1406
02:24:40.04 --> 02:24:40.84
Maybe

1407
02:24:40.84 --> 02:24:43.32
Yeah, probably none the last sometimes I forget

1408
02:24:43.96 --> 02:24:49.08
three four and you if you forget for like four days and you're still working out of whatever you'll feel it

1409
02:24:49.48 --> 02:24:52.44

Level seven panic I forgot my krill oil bring me some yeah, like you know

1414
02:25:07.40 --> 02:25:11.16

Resents also join warfare that's for your joints maintain your body structure while you're working out good golf because it does

1419
02:25:34.52 --> 02:25:41.96
Disappeate I don't want to use word dissipate, but what do you call degenerate degenerate? Sure after time when you when you go hard in the pain

1420
02:25:42.84 --> 02:25:44.44
It does

1421
02:25:44.44 --> 02:25:47.64
Unless like I said they got compression gear geese rush guards all the stuff hoodies

1422
02:25:47.64 --> 02:25:55.96
Which may or may not be the most comfortable hoodies and pants by the way the sweatpants joggers apparently joggers

1423
02:25:55.96 --> 02:26:02.68
Yeah, so the other day I'm like okay I'm exporting some special effect that I did so I'm like shoot when when you export it's like

1424
02:26:04.76 --> 02:26:09.08
You can't really use that program, you know you can express me it's a long story, but so I'm like okay

1425
02:26:09.08 --> 02:26:12.12
I'm off my computer for you know it's gonna take like 10 minutes a big effect

1426
02:26:12.52 --> 02:26:15.16
So I got land the couch and have the whole origin

1427
02:26:15.16 --> 02:26:21.000
Outfit on for whatever reason just kind of happened to I land the couch and I'm like dang

1428
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.64
I don't think I felt this comfortable in a long time

1429
02:26:23.64 --> 02:26:26.20
But it was everything and let's come that's that's pretty bold

1430
02:26:26.20 --> 02:26:31.32
Stay there because you are a long experience level of comfort come. I mean comfort seeker

1431
02:26:31.32 --> 02:26:33.32
Yes, 100% and I evaluate

1432
02:26:34.04 --> 02:26:36.92
You evaluate various comfort levels. Yeah, this is high

1433
02:26:38.68 --> 02:26:43.56
There will been one of the highest I get it. It was everything. It was a couch. It was the time of day

1434
02:26:43.56 --> 02:26:45.56
It was the fact that I didn't really care around

1435
02:26:45.56 --> 02:26:47.40
You know that I lived with one of my

1436
02:26:47.96 --> 02:26:53.58
Seal buddies for many years. We were kind of just just just young dumb

1437
02:26:54.28 --> 02:26:59.56
From man we had this yellow couch that was like 14 feet long

1438
02:26:59.64 --> 02:27:02.04
You did it was just kind of dull. It was like

1439
02:27:02.92 --> 02:27:04.92
Maybe five feet deep

1440
02:27:05.72 --> 02:27:08.92
It was like a bed no realistically it was like five feet deep

1441
02:27:08.92 --> 02:27:13.88
What's one of you through the back curtains off it was five feet deep and it was probably 12

1442
02:27:14.52 --> 02:27:19.000
12 feet long and where was this in your apartment? Yeah, it was gold

1443
02:27:19.72 --> 02:27:21.72
It was the old felt

1444
02:27:21.72 --> 02:27:23.72
But we got it from some

1445
02:27:23.72 --> 02:27:27.24
Shop yeah, that's the can you have in like a lounge we did something all ours for

1446
02:27:28.76 --> 02:27:32.64
We had one like that at UH in the in the football lounge. Yeah, it was like it wasn't most

1447
02:27:32.64 --> 02:27:36.36
God, you know that couch you were looking at tomato my house. You're like, that's a nice couch

1448
02:27:36.36 --> 02:27:38.68
This thing that couch out there all nice

1449
02:27:39.24 --> 02:27:43.72
Doesn't even come close to the comfort of the old gold couch yet. I think it was the deal

1450
02:27:44.20 --> 02:27:45.72
yet weird how like

1451
02:27:46.20 --> 02:27:50.84
Ugly like couches will be the most functionally comfortable

1452
02:27:51.48 --> 02:27:54.52
We had this one my wife forst us to give away and

1453
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.48
Cuz it was outside it got phased out slowly

1454
02:27:57.48 --> 02:27:59.80
You know how you get a new couch and you're like okay, what do we do there?

1455
02:27:59.80 --> 02:28:02.44
Well, I'm not gonna give it away because it's too comfortable

1456
02:28:02.44 --> 02:28:07.08
We've had it for so long and it's like in good shape. Oh, and then we get another couch for the you know for the side there

1457
02:28:07.08 --> 02:28:09.08
Oh, we know we do this so it ends up outside

1458
02:28:09.24 --> 02:28:12.80
You know anyone's gonna be a couch outside. It's like it's kind of you know

1459
02:28:12.80 --> 02:28:15.000
Doesn't doesn't look good blah blah blah

1460
02:28:15.72 --> 02:28:19.20
Give it away, but it was the most comfortable couch. I think we actually know the new one

1461
02:28:21.20 --> 02:28:22.70
Nonetheless

1462
02:28:22.70 --> 02:28:28.62
Back to origin go to origin main dot com. That's it. That's where you get it and you can get the discipline there, too

1463
02:28:28.62 --> 02:28:37.22
Yeah, yeah, yeah the discipline big done the pre workout the pre mission the pre mission yeah

1464
02:28:37.22 --> 02:28:43.06
Since it it to me I take it before I work out see I don't I take it before I do jitsu

1465
02:28:43.06 --> 02:28:47.58
Yeah, I take it before I have to do a podcast or take it before I have to do

1466
02:28:48.38 --> 02:28:52.54
Like an look I speak in event where I need to do my brain has to be firing

1467
02:28:52.54 --> 02:28:58.46
Yeah, yeah, could you think it before bed? I mean I know it has a little bit caffeine but like I have and

1468
02:29:01.06 --> 02:29:05.78
I think you can I don't think I'd strongly recommend it especially if you're caffeine sensitive like I

1469
02:29:05.78 --> 02:29:12.04
Yeah, but you drink your nine monster energy drinks a day you can drink whatever you want from

1470
02:29:12.70 --> 02:29:16.90
Jocco White tea because there's a lot left caffeine well that you figure the distance

1471
02:29:16.90 --> 02:29:22.50
She saw a lot of people you know a lot of people hit me if you used jocco white tea to ween off of full strength coffee. Yeah

1472
02:29:22.50 --> 02:29:26.06
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because they don't want to be on that coffee, but there's enough

1473
02:29:26.34 --> 02:29:29.74
Can I feel a little something to ween off? It's like methadone

1474
02:29:30.58 --> 02:29:31.98
Get an off heroin

1475
02:29:31.98 --> 02:29:37.18
So you might want to try that you know the jocco white and you want to have coffee breath anymore. Yeah, because no one likes that

1476
02:29:37.54 --> 02:29:40.22
Yeah, it's really not like methadone, but

1477
02:29:40.22 --> 02:29:47.96
Since the the pre workout pre mission has a cognitive enhancers you figure you know when you sleep

1478
02:29:47.96 --> 02:29:51.42
That's like the best part of your brain or go for the best time for your brain to recover

1479
02:29:51.42 --> 02:29:57.04
Maybe that's a little something. I don't recommend it cuz like I said, but you never know could be could be something

1480
02:29:57.04 --> 02:30:00.06
I wouldn't drink it before I go to bed. Maybe when you wake up

1481
02:30:00.78 --> 02:30:06.14
Yeah, but I don't drink when I wake up. I'll drink because I don't drink it for I don't drink any kind of pre workout for

1482
02:30:06.14 --> 02:30:10.34
Before I work out before I lift weights before I do a metcon

1483
02:30:10.34 --> 02:30:13.86
I don't yeah, yeah, I should I don't know and you know you should I mean

1484
02:30:14.18 --> 02:30:17.22
One of the reasons because I don't like everything. I think my stomach when I'm working out

1485
02:30:17.42 --> 02:30:20.50
Yeah, but those pre workouts is like yeah, I know there's like really anything

1486
02:30:20.50 --> 02:30:24.50
No, it's just like doing water. Yeah, yeah, I'll maybe I'll try it. Yeah, yeah

1487
02:30:24.90 --> 02:30:28.38
Tell me report back, please. Okay. We'll do yesterday also

1488
02:30:29.30 --> 02:30:31.30
Speak to work you know

1489
02:30:31.30 --> 02:30:36.40
I get my kettlebells from on it on it comes last drop. Let's read get them kettlebells the

1490
02:30:37.42 --> 02:30:42.72
Designer way you don't have to get the designer ones. I know I always see the designer ones get the designer ones and I'm still saying it

1491
02:30:42.72 --> 02:30:44.06
Well big time

1492
02:30:44.06 --> 02:30:48.06
So you don't have to like I don't want to get the number ones, but nonetheless on it

1493
02:30:48.06 --> 02:30:51.42
They have other cool workout stuff you want your workout to be creative

1494
02:30:54.74 --> 02:30:59.18
Telling you like you know the you know the mace right? Yeah one of those I have I do yeah

1495
02:30:59.18 --> 02:31:01.94
You've done like a workout with a mace. Yeah, yeah

1496
02:31:01.94 --> 02:31:05.90
I incorporate them my name for I've got two mace exercises

1497
02:31:05.90 --> 02:31:11.74
One of them is called like I have notes in my notebook on what my workout sure and I have like barbarian smash

1498
02:31:12.42 --> 02:31:15.74
That's the word no, no, no, that's the movement of the movement

1499
02:31:15.74 --> 02:31:20.48
Okay, I think you made up them and then one's like a battle act swing sure so yeah, yeah

1500
02:31:20.48 --> 02:31:24.04
You can do this with the mace. Yeah, and the mace is heavy though

1501
02:31:24.04 --> 02:31:31.68
Well, like the various is 20 pounds. Yeah, that's heavy. Oh, yeah, do you have you 20 pounds? That's you

1502
02:31:31.68 --> 02:31:33.68
How much base ball bat way?

1503
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:34.68
I don't know

1504
02:31:34.68 --> 02:31:40.76
I don't know a couple pounds. Yeah, and then you can put his all 16 ounce weight the other day for the end of your bat when you're getting warmed up

1505
02:31:40.76 --> 02:31:47.000
A mace is 20 pounds. Yes, it's really heavy and the to me very careful actually

1506
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:53.88
Yeah big time because you don't drop that back that much weight on a on a mace with that weird because the 20-pond dumbbell

1507
02:31:53.88 --> 02:31:56.36
You think out that's a 20 but that's not even part of the workout

1508
02:31:56.36 --> 02:32:01.52
I don't warm up with 20 pounds in any exercise kind of attitude and then you're like so do it

1509
02:32:01.52 --> 02:32:06.84
So light then you pick up that mace and you're like this is like the heavy stick I've ever been to hell before sure

1510
02:32:06.84 --> 02:32:08.84

echelon the front echelons the people in the front lines, and that's why we named the organization

1611
02:39:50.60 --> 02:39:53.08
echelon front because there's a lot of people that talk about leadership

1612
02:39:53.08 --> 02:39:55.56
But they're talking about it from the rear echelon from the back

1613
