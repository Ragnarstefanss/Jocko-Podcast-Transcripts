Like I was just saying like some people and this is true with fighters some fighters don't like Striking they don't like to get hit specifically no one minds punching people some people like it Some people like they they truly like to punch someone else in the head Some people are good with it most people are good with it because it feels good Some people don't like to get hit they really don't like that Some people don't like to get smashed on the ground they get claustrophobic right then like that Like your whole thing right now is like it's just jujitsu and Or think of it as like just this complete learning experience Of course but forget about the boxing because anytime like that's how that's what's gonna Happened when you keep that boxing on your mind or the keep boxing on your mind You're like for why am I doing this when I could be doing boxing which was like bad ass anyway, you know kind of thing But just forget about it but I was just feeling this or you know It's just you know any time there's not like a full on 100% full speed apology towards someone like don't mention The reasons why you felt that way don't mention you kind of justification on why you went there with your mind Whatever it's all just like this what it did this all like terrible and whatever You have you know 25 over 25 years experience Train very strong and big by the way like compared to like a normal duty to guy like you're a big you're a Think that's huge Played you did to player big strong experience know what to do know what not to do all that doesn't mean anything I think that's for that moment. Whatever that's kind of like the guy who says like hey This is how I am taking it or leave it kind of thing like if they're you know like those people They're like you just make it my arm there Gordon Ryan did not do that to someone that didn't know I know only that's the funny because that's those those those are the Hicks in stories You know like Hicks and would be like I'm gonna every all of you 14 black belts And then if you don't like it still Didn't don't train like I there was one guy on social media that like kept coming back to me like I know I hate you get to you Yes, that's the freedom part of cruising The time is like a it can be kind of like a balloon you know with like little leaks in it where you know Yeah, Mark Mark learned some new lessons I'll read some excerpts from it on the podcast in the coming months just you know some little Tastes of Mark's mission extreme ownership of course That is the book that wrote in my brother, Dave Babin Combat leadership for business in life How to take ownership which I talked a little bit about today Just when he goes freedom the field manual How to get after it Mentally physically Get some if you want the audio version of that it is not unautable it is on MP3 iTunes Amazon music Google play another MP3 platforms Eshalon fun is our leadership consulting company I had a guy Talking to a potential client company was like hey can you help us Establish a cultural leadership inside of our company I'm like that is what that's what we do so if you need help with leadership at your company Reach out to us. We train leadership pragmatically Tools You will be you will this is pretty cool you will be a better leader when you come out of the monster you will be 100% I don't know if you'll be a hundred percent better of leader you will have a hundred percent chance or a hundred percent chance of becoming a better leader how much I am not a hundred percent sure on that figure But you will definitely be a better leader and when we got done I think I've talked about this before but we got done in Austin And we are at GJ2 Well, you're teaching GJ2 and I was like this is such a good deal To get the information that comes at the monster to Have that opportunity to learn these lessons from the battlefield that you can then take and apply to your business and your life And on top of that like the icing on the cake is is going to GJ2 and getting an introduction to that He's the commander of lightning six his Anglico team and I got a picture of us in Ramadi together on a rooftop and we're both asleep I don't even know what it was taken, but it's pretty awesome and it shows you like Like you know what's your awesome is like we're both asleep we both have all of our gear on sitting but I'm saying that can is apologizing when you apologize to someone you know Like someone's like hey, hey look look mean you had a disagreement escalated whatever then the next time like hey man. I will Because it's this if someone I dig it as far as like doing it it feels like it does feel like like a humble kind of approach But that that is kind of how juditsu is you know unless it's like some that's huge giant like football player Just spashing and riding away the whole time if you're it's something engaging you that's kind of how it is where you're like Yeah for sure Okay, I would say this try this if you in this situation this is what I would do Try to forget about but like when you're like okay, I'm gonna go jujitsu today Forget about boxing as a concept forget about kickbox forget about it like don't don't think about that so it doesn't just leak through the little things that you have to do when you allow it to I think it was you that originally talked about this how much work people get done before like vacation Like they know what are going on vacation I don't know what everything done do that every day. Yeah, like you know, I call I show to play man I'm sorry will you forgive me like no Like that's this is a little too much. that I just like let leak away right there Hey, if that was part of my schedule if I needed to check these things for sure I could have like if that was on some sort of a schedule or if I If I chose to do that at a specific time I would have got that 10 minutes back somehow like that 10 minutes when the leak to it It's like do you please forgive me please forgive me like what kind of a Dick doesn't forgive someone you know It's kind of like that But if I think about it, and I've talked about this before, like, all the people that I've introduced jjitsu over the years, I think I have, like, maybe four blockbelts of people that I fully like they started jjitsu because of me. So it says like like when I was flying and I don't know why I wasn't like we were going to die. and they'll say it'll be similar to this Where it will be like like I'm trying to take extreme ownership, but you know something like this happens but anything else is gonna be knockoffs and you know kind of find that everyone's in a while There'd be where if you care if you care I dig it because to me if if someone was wearing it's a jocco thing You would understand they're like hey good evening or something like that I'd be done. Just like man you just said you're dumb kind of thing You know what else is funny as to you hear people make excuses like But instead of taking the blame instead of taking owning the excuse Yeah, so there's no eat There's no bigger excuse that gets used more common at least for like a long term goal like a like hey. I think this is actually pretty straightforward if you've got someone that's doing a better job leading then Let him lead let him lead give him some room learn from them support them the best you can and the best way you can most likely support them is by getting out of the way And letting them do what they're doing and then get them the support that they need and what this is going to give you The benefit of is now you can instead of looking Down and in and managing your team you can look up and out and forward and see what is going on in the future and Prep the battlefield and in the future or prep the next market area or look for recruiting or you can move you can lead you can actually lead And Let that you know Young buck handle the things that are going on tack pre gone about for right now You just say this to the to the seal leadership. It's good and it's like I said I mean I had my shoulder Where I couldn't do muscle ups for like six months and then when we came out with the first like experimental But yeah that one do origin main.com Real good also an origin main like I was gonna say is geese for all the people who have been asked in Dave Burke today called me today About geese like what up with the geese I mean my gear and all this stuff you've been doing no wait was even question He was actually asking more and I agree and I think that if you That it did say it really depends on who you are but to me that was the the big time appeal and Still is the legitimate appeal of Juditsu where you know like people even now they'll be like hey, but this martial arts is superior because this and that but it's still is beneficial though feels like it is for That's what it feels like that's why I'm saying that's what it feels like to you and me and to the people that we hang out with And it like, Juditsu seems like a chore for him because you know what else he's getting beat up, you know, if he hasn't just getting into it now. so I for whatever reason I'm thinking to myself I wonder if they were watching me like oh another person it take to do his phone and they're kind of just had that thought, you know That I thought about how to wait There that was like a good maybe 10 minutes. Yeah, and this and these are one of those ones that is kind of like man I wish I would it it would have saved me a lot of pain in the past now, you know like if you're joined So just holding them. Do you think that sometimes Like this you know how some people will At like at the monsters people will say they'll ask you this I mean you can have fun We do that too like we we call it playing tag where you're like you're like touching the person you're you're I'm like man I've been training for a really long time and I'm a grown man in good physical condition Relatively strong and he can Cold me in a position where I cannot do anything and I can actually do that to him too not as clearly not as often But like we he's got he's got three physicians. so it's almost like Maybe not but it's almost like Like let's say I did something You're kind of the guy who, like, you know, like the iconic picture of the guy fanning the other guy. I think you were the one who kind of told me where you're like you should you should like plan kind of everything You got to go just plan it all and get it done and then the rest of that time is all is But if Most of the time if you're like okay, I'm gonna schedule all these things and I'm gonna boom boom again All done then it's almost like you're shifting your time And you tell me like I don't really like you did so it's like why? Yeah, so I feel like if I was one of the Don't like you don't want one of the team guys on the teams thinking that I think I wouldn't think that So you know especially you have like three four things But all those like little in between times if you can add them all up, but sure So he's actually said that before like a couple times and every single time it made me if you way better like Even the I mean of course the truth will set you free. So girls they prefer like landmarks and you know, like the voice on the thing. And this school's for anything by the way, if you are successful, especially if they're all, if they're kind of similar like in this case where he's like, okay, martial arts, right? Well, it must have been a miscommunication just like I said because this is what it was It's like okay when you go out for the camera from across sight And the guy streams is arm you want to get his arm behind his back bend his arm basically in behind his back That's what he said and that's the move he's had shown to me before and it's one of his things his tricks So he's just I want to show this thing I think he's like you know, Jock was got a good defense here, so you gotta be ready if the guy does this They require like landmarks got kind of guide them like okay make a right. I was like after awhile I'm like okay, can you defend yourself against you know I take down can you get up from the bottom? Because it's like, you know, you start to roll like I, you've heard of them. I forget it was what he was like, he's like now I was a full on, you know, first date roll. and I'm thankful about that shoulder injuries are worse than elbow elbows like they heal you know and even this one I can do like I'm It'll be fine. That's like when you dream about it, you know how like you're dreaming. Yeah I think that's the thing you know how like guys in the UFC that'll that'll happen sometimes where they're super good at jujitsu He's just like a miscommunity, you know like And I'm like, thinking, they're like, hey, this is the way to act right. I'm a seed of the cotton That's it you do the cotton all the way up to the gear you wearing people like when you say cotton Sure, and they like when you say important important oh yeah, you like you handle you take this, you know you got this one kind of thing Yeah, it's like um we'll back to the thing when you're like If you don't like Juditsu, if you don't think you like, maybe you, what do you think of this rule? You're like hey when it was time when I failed at Nav you were just like I got this here.
