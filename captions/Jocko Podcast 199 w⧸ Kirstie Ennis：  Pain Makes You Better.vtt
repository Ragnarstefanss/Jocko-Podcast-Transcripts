00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.60
This is Jocopodcast number 199 with echo Charles and me, Jocob Willing. Good evening, I go good evening.

2
00:00:11.92 --> 00:00:18.88
I have not been on this earth long, but I've been through more than most wood in the lifetime.

3
00:00:20.16 --> 00:00:26.80
I served six years in the United States Marine Corps as a helicopter door gunner and airframes mechanic.

4
00:00:26.80 --> 00:00:33.92
On my last deployment to Afghanistan, I was involved in a helicopter crash.

5
00:00:35.92 --> 00:00:41.20
June 23, 2012 was the defining moment in my life.

6
00:00:43.44 --> 00:00:48.32
I suffered a traumatic brain injury, severe facial trauma,

7
00:00:48.32 --> 00:00:57.36
a left leg above the knee, amputation, damaged my cervical spine, and damaged my upper arms.

8
00:01:01.76 --> 00:01:08.80
I remember screaming with tears rolling down my face when they said they were taking my leg above the knee.

9
00:01:08.80 --> 00:01:21.68
I thought it was all over. That all of my dreams returned in the nightmares.

10
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:40.24
I have it on repeat in my head, a scream encompassing terror, pain, and fear of what my life might become.

11
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:58.16
Those are the words and thoughts of a wounded warrior, a Marine Corps sergeant, a third generation

12
00:01:58.16 --> 00:02:08.80
Marine, whose mother and father were both Marines. In this case, this particular

13
00:02:08.80 --> 00:02:15.12
Marine was able to take that fear, that fear of a new life of a different life,

14
00:02:15.92 --> 00:02:25.92
of what life might become with those devastating injuries suffered, and turn that new life into one of

15
00:02:27.76 --> 00:02:35.60
overcoming struggle, a life of facing new challenges and a life of leading the way

16
00:02:35.60 --> 00:02:46.48
and showing the path for anyone that faces challenges and struggles in any walk of life.

17
00:02:49.12 --> 00:02:55.04
As this Marine proves, you are never out of the fight, and it is an honor to have this Marine

18
00:02:55.04 --> 00:03:06.80
with us on the podcast tonight. I'm a Marine by the name of Kirstie, Anis Kirstie. Welcome to the podcast.

19
00:03:06.80 --> 00:03:14.24
Thank you, you're having me. I dug a little deep on your blogs and Facebook to assemble some

20
00:03:14.24 --> 00:03:19.92
things, because I like to read what people write, because I think that's the best pathway to figure

21
00:03:19.92 --> 00:03:26.80
out what they're thinking at that time. You got some pretty incredible statements on there.

22
00:03:26.80 --> 00:03:35.04
I was able to go through them and assemble them. Let's start off talking about where you came from,

23
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.12
because I think that's always a good place to start. One thing that you're writing,

24
00:03:39.12 --> 00:03:43.04
I found this, which I thought was just, I just had to bring this up.

25
00:03:45.36 --> 00:03:49.28
I'm that guy, somebody is going to go through all your social media stuff.

26
00:03:49.28 --> 00:03:54.96
That's me. So here we go. This is what you said about your childhood. I was a jerk as a child.

27
00:03:54.96 --> 00:03:59.12
My mom and dad would just love to tell you stories about me dismantling my window alarm

28
00:03:59.12 --> 00:04:04.48
to sneak out, disconnecting phone lines, so my principal wouldn't call home, or maybe even bringing

29
00:04:04.48 --> 00:04:09.68
stink bombs into school. So there's, we're getting an indication, kind of a view into what you were

30
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:15.12
like as a kid. Where was it? Where did all this take place? Oh, man. Also, with both my parents

31
00:04:15.12 --> 00:04:19.68
being in the Marine Corps, we bounced all over the place. But after my mom and my dad got out,

32
00:04:19.68 --> 00:04:26.16
we went back to the Panhandle of Florida. I spent most of my middle school and high school years there,

33
00:04:26.16 --> 00:04:31.68
and I was just an absolute terrorist. I mean, I gave my parents a run for their money.

34
00:04:31.68 --> 00:04:36.16
I mean, I look back now and I actually feel really, really bad about it. I'm terrified of kids

35
00:04:36.16 --> 00:04:41.36
of my own because I know payback is going to be a pitch. But yeah, I mean, I was just always

36
00:04:41.36 --> 00:04:46.80
way too smart for my own good. My school was a joke. Athletics were never really hard. I didn't,

37
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:51.44
it wasn't challenged. So yeah, I was just always up to, to know good. Nothing like malicious.

38
00:04:52.48 --> 00:04:57.04
But yeah, how is a little misgivier? The most malicious thing was stink bombs in school.

39
00:04:57.04 --> 00:05:02.80
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. We don't know what the statute of limitations is, so we're not going to go

40
00:05:02.80 --> 00:05:08.56
there. Yes. Exactly. What, um, you mentioned athletics a little bit, what sports did you play?

41
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:12.16
So growing up, I did a bunch of team sports. I mean, everything from softball to volleyball

42
00:05:12.16 --> 00:05:17.20
and everything in between, actually like a lot of the individual extreme sports that I'm doing now,

43
00:05:17.20 --> 00:05:22.48
never even did a music hit. Everything was obviously very southern and team-related.

44
00:05:23.20 --> 00:05:29.04
So were you good at, were you good athlete? I liked the thing, so. Yeah. I mean, but again,

45
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:33.68
I never really was challenged. It was just, I was okay with, you know, being good, but not really

46
00:05:33.68 --> 00:05:38.80
having to try that hard at it. So. And that was your high school career. I mean, you played sports.

47
00:05:38.80 --> 00:05:46.80
At what point did you go from the, the stink unit bomber into saying you're going to join the

48
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:51.04
Marine Corps? Yeah. Well, so I actually was doing with my high school curriculum at the time I was 15.

49
00:05:51.04 --> 00:05:57.36
So I started doing college classes at the time, Pensacola Junior College. And yeah, I got my

50
00:05:57.36 --> 00:06:04.32
two degree and again, were you just hyper motivated to get done with high school or? Yeah. And just bored.

51
00:06:04.32 --> 00:06:07.68
I was really bored and I mean, I'm sure you're familiar with Pensacola. There's, like,

52
00:06:07.68 --> 00:06:12.96
especially the surrounding towns. There's just not a lot there. So, yeah, just wanted to be done with it

53
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:18.72
and get the heck out and never look back. And then you enlisted, how old were you when you enlisted?

54
00:06:18.72 --> 00:06:23.20
17. Did your parents had to sign the paperwork? How did your parents

55
00:06:23.20 --> 00:06:28.80
two Marines feel about you going in the Marine Corps? So my mom was like, good,

56
00:06:28.80 --> 00:06:33.84
good, right, it signed immediately. I wanted nothing more to do with me. I was out. My dad was pretty

57
00:06:33.84 --> 00:06:38.24
pissed though. He really wanted me to finish that last two years of college before I went

58
00:06:38.24 --> 00:06:42.64
up to the Marine Corps. And so he came home. He was, he was working on the pipeline at the time.

59
00:06:42.64 --> 00:06:46.88
Came home like a bad out of hell. And it was like, you know, argued with me the whole nine.

60
00:06:46.88 --> 00:06:50.56
And I just lied to my teeth and told him that I would do a dust job to give him a sign. I was like,

61
00:06:50.56 --> 00:06:54.56
look dude, you can sign the papers now or you can wait eight months. I'm going to sign him many ways

62
00:06:54.56 --> 00:06:59.76
myself. So he finally buckled. He trusted me, which that was a bad idea when I was 17.

63
00:07:01.04 --> 00:07:07.60
It's so strange when you look back. And I got, I got a son right now that's 16. And I'm thinking, wow,

64
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.28
like, it, you grow up so much between the ages of 16, 17 and like, even 22 and then 22, 25,

65
00:07:17.28 --> 00:07:21.92
like, you don't know a lot when you're 17 years old. That's the bottom line. So I don't.

66
00:07:22.72 --> 00:07:29.12
But you, I mean, I will say this. Both your parents been Marines. One thing that's kind of cool is

67
00:07:29.12 --> 00:07:33.52
they at least knew what was going to happen. I mean, if you, if your parents didn't have any

68
00:07:33.52 --> 00:07:38.24
experience, they probably would have completely freaked out. But you at least know what the Marine

69
00:07:38.24 --> 00:07:43.84
Corps is. You know that it's, you know that it does what it does and it does it well. You know,

70
00:07:43.84 --> 00:07:52.08
the Marine Corps puts kids from every background, every walk of life, onto the path of being a

71
00:07:52.08 --> 00:07:58.24
Marine, which is a square-to-way thing to be in my opinion. Absolutely. How much of a shocker was

72
00:07:58.24 --> 00:08:04.08
it when you, how much longer was it until you went to boot camp? I went a few short months after that.

73
00:08:04.64 --> 00:08:09.52
Originally, I was going to try and hold out and it actually weight a little bit before my 18th birthday.

74
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:14.96
But again, I got that little two-degree from Pensacola Junior College and had a little bit of

75
00:08:14.96 --> 00:08:23.04
free time started to get in trouble again. So it was just time to leave. How much of a shock was it

76
00:08:23.04 --> 00:08:29.36
for you checking into boot camp? You know, it's funny. I'll tell a quick story about my family or my

77
00:08:29.36 --> 00:08:33.28
parents because it's my hands down favorite story. But mom dad got married at 18,

78
00:08:33.28 --> 00:08:39.68
lived on a bar beach in Florida. Dad joins the Marine Corps right afterwards. Eight years later,

79
00:08:39.68 --> 00:08:45.12
I'm already born. We're living on 29 poms in California and my mom comes home and tells my dad,

80
00:08:45.12 --> 00:08:50.64
you know, I think these female Marines are pretty badass. Dad looks at moms as I'll never be married

81
00:08:50.64 --> 00:08:55.20
to a female Marine. Mom looks at him, turns around leaves, gets an age waiver and joins the Marine

82
00:08:55.20 --> 00:09:02.32
Corps. So like my earliest memory is actually, you know, my mom walking across the parade deck.

83
00:09:02.32 --> 00:09:06.16
Like so how old is your mom when she elucidated the Marine Corps? She would have been 26,

84
00:09:06.16 --> 00:09:11.36
27. Yeah, that's the Marine Corps doesn't take people out of that old. That's like an ancient

85
00:09:11.36 --> 00:09:17.28
dinosaur in the Marine Corps to go to the home boot camp. Yeah, in boot camp they all called her mom.

86
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:21.84
How long did your dad end up doing the Marine Corps? I'm using for nine years.

87
00:09:21.84 --> 00:09:27.04
And then what about your mom? She just did four. Part of it was a spite thing I think and then

88
00:09:27.04 --> 00:09:31.20
part of it, you know, she wanted to do it. I think she would live in regret if she didn't do it.

89
00:09:31.20 --> 00:09:38.48
Especially if her husband told her now. So that's the last five he did not. You knew where that

90
00:09:38.48 --> 00:09:44.72
was going. So so you check into the boot camp? Was it was it a shock to your sister? Did you

91
00:09:45.76 --> 00:09:49.28
be with your mom and dad both of these Marine Corps? Had they kind of

92
00:09:49.28 --> 00:09:54.000
given you a heads up, did you understand what you were getting into? And how much did it still shock you?

93
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.04
Yeah, well I so I kid you not like I idolized my parents. You know, I just loved the fact that

94
00:09:59.04 --> 00:10:02.72
they got up every morning, put the uniform on and did something bigger than themselves.

95
00:10:02.72 --> 00:10:07.28
So I mean my favorite movie, I mean I got off the bus and watched documentaries on Marine Corps

96
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:12.24
boot camp. You know, my Barbies were dressed and dressed blues. My favorite t-shirt was my mom's

97
00:10:12.24 --> 00:10:17.20
US Marine kind of thing. So I was very well educated and versed on what boot camp would consist of.

98
00:10:17.20 --> 00:10:22.80
And of course I heard all the stories from everybody. But I loved boot camp. I made it way harder

99
00:10:22.80 --> 00:10:27.60
on myself than I hated too, because I was again 17 years old and just a little shit. I you know,

100
00:10:27.60 --> 00:10:33.68
they'd say yell and I whispered just being just going to pain. But as far as like the physical

101
00:10:33.68 --> 00:10:38.64
aspect of it, you know, I just reminded myself like I'm getting to play for 13 weeks. Like

102
00:10:38.64 --> 00:10:43.68
where else do you get paid to run and throw grenades and you know, do the obstacle course?

103
00:10:44.88 --> 00:10:48.56
The was there anything you had trouble with in Marine Corps boot camp?

104
00:10:49.44 --> 00:10:53.44
I honestly I just had a head and issue just like I said breaking down my attitude.

105
00:10:53.44 --> 00:10:58.48
My attitude was you know, I wanted to say why do everything. And so that was when I say the

106
00:10:58.48 --> 00:11:02.24
hard part. Again, it was just yeah, keeping my head in the right place.

107
00:11:04.48 --> 00:11:09.44
And then how did you end up becoming like what was the process for you picking your MOS?

108
00:11:12.08 --> 00:11:16.32
Well, I wanted again, wanted something to challenge myself. You know, I didn't want to do

109
00:11:16.32 --> 00:11:22.72
supplier admin and I wanted to deploy. When I actually walked out of my class that I was in when I was 17,

110
00:11:22.72 --> 00:11:27.04
I very vividly remember looking around this chemistry lab and being like, he won't do it.

111
00:11:27.04 --> 00:11:30.72
She can't do it. There's no way in hell, he'll you know, he'll deploy or any of that. And

112
00:11:31.28 --> 00:11:35.76
obviously very terrible and judgmental of me. But I mean, that was the catalyst. I mean, that inspired

113
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:40.64
me to walk out of that Kim Lab and go to the recruiter's office. What year was this? 2008.

114
00:11:40.64 --> 00:11:45.84
Oh, so you fall on new that you were going to go to unemployment to our acting Afghanistan.

115
00:11:45.84 --> 00:11:50.000
If you got a some kind of a job that would put you in the field in some way. Exactly.

116
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.64
Yeah. And I wanted that. I mean, I growing up, I would like for for a long time, some of my family

117
00:11:54.64 --> 00:11:58.24
was like, oh, God, she's going to be a social worker. Because I just always loved like,

118
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:02.16
I was the bully that beat up the bully. You know, I love protecting the kids that, you know,

119
00:12:02.16 --> 00:12:06.72
couldn't or wouldn't protect themselves. So yeah, when I went to the recruiter's office,

120
00:12:06.72 --> 00:12:10.32
I was like, you just got to give me something where I feel like I'm living that higher purpose.

121
00:12:10.32 --> 00:12:14.32
Or I know exactly without a doubt, you know, what my role in the grand scheme is.

122
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:17.04
So yeah, and I went into the recruiter's office. I was like,

123
00:12:17.04 --> 00:12:22.08
from you, whatever you got. And then of course, the Azva, I had the scores to do whatever. And

124
00:12:22.08 --> 00:12:26.16
I knew nothing about aviation, but that's, that's what I went for.

125
00:12:27.12 --> 00:12:31.60
To become a, to become an airframe mechanic. That was the first step. See,

126
00:12:31.60 --> 00:12:34.64
and where is it? Isn't that school in Pensacola? It is.

127
00:12:34.64 --> 00:12:37.04
I'm looking to imagine how much trouble I got in again.

128
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:43.60
When were you, do you remember September 11th?

129
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:50.24
Yeah, I was in fifth grade, Mrs. Todd's class at WH Road in Milton, Florida.

130
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:52.56
How much understanding did you have in what was happening?

131
00:12:52.56 --> 00:12:54.24
Were you parents selling the Marine Corps at the time?

132
00:12:54.96 --> 00:12:59.52
No, but my dad was actually working on the outskirts of New York City.

133
00:13:00.96 --> 00:13:03.76
And so I remember my mom picking me up. I mean,

134
00:13:04.88 --> 00:13:07.60
honestly, she was just petrified. She thought she was going to get,

135
00:13:08.40 --> 00:13:11.28
you know, stop lost. She thought she was going to get called back and she didn't know what to do.

136
00:13:11.28 --> 00:13:15.20
My dad's working in New York and you know, we're down in Florida. And I just remember laying

137
00:13:15.20 --> 00:13:20.08
on the carpet in front of a TV that wasn't even on a stand under this big blue jean,

138
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:24.96
blanket, and just sitting there and crying and waiting to hear from my dad and figure out what's

139
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:32.16
going on. So yeah, I mean, obviously very emotional. And then as you, I mean, going back a little

140
00:13:32.16 --> 00:13:37.20
bit, but when you're doing the Marine Corps, your parents absolutely know that in the Marine Corps,

141
00:13:37.20 --> 00:13:42.24
after September 11th, if you were in the Marine Corps, there was a really good chance you were

142
00:13:42.24 --> 00:13:49.52
going to Iraq or Afghanistan. And when what year was it you enlisted 2008? Yeah.

143
00:13:51.28 --> 00:13:55.04
So you go to Airframes School, how long is that school last? It's only a few months really,

144
00:13:55.04 --> 00:14:01.60
but it was hard to get classed up into it. But I was in the A school for like four months down there

145
00:14:01.60 --> 00:14:07.44
and then C-school over a new river for a couple of months. New river, what, where's that? It's

146
00:14:07.44 --> 00:14:12.48
right outside of the Lysun. Okay. And this is, you know, just for people that don't,

147
00:14:13.68 --> 00:14:18.24
for people that don't know too much about the military, I mean, the military is a massive

148
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:25.52
organization that basically encompasses all of everything that happens in the world. So yes,

149
00:14:25.52 --> 00:14:30.16
you see Marines flying helicopters, but there's a Marine that knows how to work on that

150
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:32.96
helicopter, there's a Marine that knows how to fix that helicopters and Marine that knows how to

151
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:37.44
fuel that helicopters, Marines that know how to work on the electronics and there, and then there's

152
00:14:37.44 --> 00:14:42.32
people that know how to land it. There's, there's people that do everything and then there's people that

153
00:14:42.96 --> 00:14:47.60
supply the people that are doing all those things with the gear that they need and there's

154
00:14:47.60 --> 00:14:53.36
Marines that are in charge of edge can so there's this whole world inside of the military inside

155
00:14:53.36 --> 00:14:59.92
the Marine Corps. So, and you have to have it all in order in order to go forward and fight wars.

156
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:07.12
There has to be all these different logistical support elements and equipment elements. I mean,

157
00:15:07.12 --> 00:15:10.72
it's just, it's just this massive machine and the army has the same thing and the navy obviously

158
00:15:10.72 --> 00:15:15.92
has the same thing with ships and planes and everything else. So, but what's cool is when you join

159
00:15:15.92 --> 00:15:20.000
the service as they used to say when I was a kid, do they still say that? Oh,

160
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.12
I'll just go and join the service. I always felt like I was in a World War II and somebody asked me,

161
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:30.08
hey, how's it being, how's it run in the service going? So, when you join the service,

162
00:15:32.08 --> 00:15:36.08
when you join the service, they give you some kind of a job and some kind of an education. So,

163
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:41.68
that's what you were doing learning how to work on on the on the 53, right? That's your,

164
00:15:41.68 --> 00:15:47.84
is it specific to the 53? Yeah. So, you're learning specifically how to work on a specific aircraft

165
00:15:47.84 --> 00:15:54.000
that is used by the Marine Corps called the, what is the MH53? What's the Marine Corps version

166
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.64
called? The CH 53. Big, awesome bird, powerful, massive bird helicopter that can hold

167
00:16:03.68 --> 00:16:11.28
40 Marines. I'm gonna say. I'd have memorized all that stuff. So, my memories get in shady speaking

168
00:16:11.28 --> 00:16:17.92
of senior citizen over here. So, then where do you get stationed when you get done with these schools?

169
00:16:17.92 --> 00:16:23.28
My first situation was Miramar, actually. Oh, okay. Okay, really a good plane. Yeah.

170
00:16:23.68 --> 00:16:29.36
A little bit better than 29 pounds. A little bit better. So, and then what's your day-to-day life

171
00:16:29.36 --> 00:16:34.88
when you are, are you attached to a squadron? Is that what's going on? Yeah, so my first unit was

172
00:16:34.88 --> 00:16:41.84
having marine helicopter squadron 465. And to be totally honest, the Airframe shop didn't really

173
00:16:41.84 --> 00:16:46.96
want me there right off the bat. You know, throwing a female into a shop of all dudes, you're adding

174
00:16:46.96 --> 00:16:52.16
a pretty interesting dynamic. So, it was really a matter of, I had to prove myself, how to wear a

175
00:16:52.16 --> 00:16:57.20
chip on my shoulder and keep my head down. Again, gotten to my fair share of trouble as an 18-year-old

176
00:16:57.20 --> 00:17:04.72
in San Diego. I worked my way out of that, does to be compared. When I first got in the Navy and

177
00:17:04.72 --> 00:17:12.000
got to San Diego, there was a rule. The drinking age was 21 in California, but the drinking age on

178
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.04
base was 18. So, like, yeah, you could do as kids that just had never drank before, just wrecking

179
00:17:19.04 --> 00:17:24.80
themselves. There was such a disaster. At some point, luckily, they changed it. So, you're in there,

180
00:17:24.80 --> 00:17:29.92
you're the first female you said that that was with this group. Yeah, and very, very long time,

181
00:17:29.92 --> 00:17:36.24
I've ever been. And then, I mean, that's when you're a new guy checking in. Anyways, it's going to be

182
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:41.44
you're going to get, you're going to get, I guess, hazed is the politically incorrect work, right?

183
00:17:41.44 --> 00:17:45.60
We're not, because you're not allowed to haze, but you're going to get, is Razz okay? Is that the same thing?

184
00:17:45.60 --> 00:17:48.88
You're going to get Razz, you're going to get hassled, but when you're checking in somewhere,

185
00:17:49.92 --> 00:17:54.96
when you check in, are you guys already looking, are you already seeing a deployment ahead of you?

186
00:17:54.96 --> 00:17:59.36
So, when you check in on the, okay, we're going on deployment at this time? Right when I got there, I actually

187
00:17:59.36 --> 00:18:03.92
consider myself to have been getting lucky, because they were just leaving for a mu. So, I lucked out and

188
00:18:03.92 --> 00:18:09.92
missed the mu, and got to stick around, stick back, and actually learn my job, and become,

189
00:18:09.92 --> 00:18:13.60
become proficient in that, and then when the next cycle came around half of us went on a mu,

190
00:18:13.60 --> 00:18:18.56
then half of us went to Afghanistan, and I was lucky enough to go to Afghanistan. And then what was that

191
00:18:18.56 --> 00:18:23.60
deployment, when you were heading on that deployment, were you, what was your, what were your nerves,

192
00:18:23.60 --> 00:18:28.96
like, were you just like a typical 18 year old marine that's just fired up to go and get

193
00:18:28.96 --> 00:18:35.20
after it? Oh, I was super excited, honestly. Yeah, I mean, I was just ready to go. I mean,

194
00:18:35.20 --> 00:18:39.52
I think my bags were packed weeks in advance, but, and I don't even think the nerves kicked in about

195
00:18:39.52 --> 00:18:45.76
any of it up until you're starting to land, and you're doing your laps, that's when I got nervous.

196
00:18:46.32 --> 00:18:49.60
So, how did you, how did you guys get there? How did you guys deploy there?

197
00:18:50.32 --> 00:18:55.44
So, we came in on a segment 30. Okay, and the bird, the year helicopters were already there,

198
00:18:55.44 --> 00:19:02.48
yep. And so you were replacing basically replacing the group. Yep, exactly. And so you show up on the ground,

199
00:19:02.88 --> 00:19:05.84
and what was the day-to-day? What was your mission there? What were you doing?

200
00:19:06.64 --> 00:19:12.64
A day-to-day life. My first and second deployments were very different. The first one was, you know,

201
00:19:12.64 --> 00:19:18.08
super like maintenance, maintenance, and all the time. I mean, it was everything. I was usually

202
00:19:18.08 --> 00:19:22.000
night shift, but yeah, I mean, it was everything from doing the hydraulics to riveting,

203
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.92
welding, composite repair, you know, battle damage assessments, stuff like that. You know,

204
00:19:27.92 --> 00:19:31.60
they trusted me enough to go out and do those jobs by myself, but not really enough to,

205
00:19:32.40 --> 00:19:36.88
to come outside of the wire or do anything like that. What was the optimal like, how often were

206
00:19:36.88 --> 00:19:42.08
the birds flying? Were they flying like every single day, all day? Every single day. I mean,

207
00:19:42.08 --> 00:19:47.84
oftentimes we'd send out seven or eight flights. And again, you know, birds don't fly out

208
00:19:47.84 --> 00:19:52.40
their single ship, so we need to have 14 aircraft down and have an adult do turn around some daily

209
00:19:52.40 --> 00:19:57.20
inspections to get them out the next day or even five, six hours later. And Marine Corps usually

210
00:19:57.20 --> 00:20:01.52
deploys for six months, was it a typical kind of six month deployment? Yep, seven.

211
00:20:02.24 --> 00:20:05.76
Seven month deployment, because there's a little bit on the beginning a little bit on the end.

212
00:20:06.32 --> 00:20:08.64
Were you, what was, were you getting sleep?

213
00:20:10.16 --> 00:20:16.48
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I had, I had, it was weird. I mean, I bet I know means,

214
00:20:16.48 --> 00:20:21.44
we're doing any of the things that you guys were doing. And I very much so loved the fact that

215
00:20:21.44 --> 00:20:25.60
my job was directly supporting the guys in the ground. I had such pride in that and I knew that

216
00:20:25.60 --> 00:20:29.60
if I didn't do my job, then again, like, you guys weren't going to be able to do your job.

217
00:20:29.60 --> 00:20:34.88
So I had a huge pride in that, but I did. I mean, I loved everything about being out there.

218
00:20:35.68 --> 00:20:39.52
You know, I love the, in my mind, simplicity of it, you know, you don't worry about how

219
00:20:39.52 --> 00:20:41.52
your hair is going to look. You don't worry about what you're going to wear, what you're going to

220
00:20:41.52 --> 00:20:45.60
eat. You know, you just worry about keeping birds up, stay in a lie, keeping your guys alive,

221
00:20:45.60 --> 00:20:50.96
and coming home safe. So to me, it was a very routine. I mean, even though your days are varied

222
00:20:50.96 --> 00:20:54.32
between, you know, what your maintenance schedule or what your flight schedule looks like,

223
00:20:54.32 --> 00:20:59.20
it's, I mean, it's pretty freaking straightforward. Yeah. And, and that's one of the things that I

224
00:20:59.20 --> 00:21:03.92
love always loved about deployment was you all have done nothing else in the world matters,

225
00:21:03.92 --> 00:21:07.76
except for this thing that you're doing. You're doing your job, whatever that job may be,

226
00:21:07.76 --> 00:21:13.44
whether it's fixed in a helicopter or going out on patrol, that's what your life is. And

227
00:21:13.44 --> 00:21:19.84
like you said, there, there are lives to stick. I mean, with your job, you know, everyone's relying

228
00:21:19.84 --> 00:21:24.64
on those helicopters. Everyone's relying on those helicopters to do what they need to do to provide

229
00:21:24.64 --> 00:21:31.68
extract insert helicopter, casualty evacuation. I mean, it's absolutely critical in every single

230
00:21:31.68 --> 00:21:36.72
person that it plays a role in making sure that those things do what they're supposed to do. It's like,

231
00:21:36.72 --> 00:21:41.52
yeah, it's absolutely critical. And that becomes your whole life. That becomes your whole focus. And it's,

232
00:21:41.52 --> 00:21:49.36
it feels good in my opinion when you have that much focus and clarity in your life.

233
00:21:49.36 --> 00:21:53.28
Yeah. No, I mean, I loved it. I mean, that's why I had three months between deployments,

234
00:21:53.28 --> 00:21:58.40
four months between deployments. So you come home from that first deployment and what gave you

235
00:21:58.40 --> 00:22:02.64
because normally the Marine court takes what 12 months to 18 months between deployments for

236
00:22:03.84 --> 00:22:08.56
whatever unit, somehow you end up going switching to another unit, what happened here?

237
00:22:08.56 --> 00:22:14.08
Yeah. So towards the end of, well, towards the second half of that first deployment in May of

238
00:22:14.08 --> 00:22:18.64
about 2011, my former gunnerry sergeant, Richard, when he said, hey, you know, I want you to come

239
00:22:18.64 --> 00:22:23.44
back to Afghanistan with my unit. What do you think? Initially, I was like, get bent and do. There's

240
00:22:23.44 --> 00:22:29.92
no way I'm coming back here. Like, I need a break. But sure enough, got home August 2011. You know,

241
00:22:29.92 --> 00:22:36.24
what I'm leaving with family and then in June, or excuse me, in September 2011 was down in K-bay.

242
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:42.40
I won't complain about that with heavy marine helicopter scrogen 362. And then we were right back

243
00:22:42.40 --> 00:22:48.000
in Afghanistan. Yeah. Jen, end of January 2012. And then what did that deployment look like?

244
00:22:48.88 --> 00:22:53.12
That's when I actually was able to step up and, you know, could be proud of those

245
00:22:53.12 --> 00:22:57.12
combat action wings. And that's when I was actually, you know, a 50-calber machine gunner, aerial

246
00:22:57.12 --> 00:23:01.44
door gunner. And again, you know, I'm still trying to rentures and maintaining the aircraft that I'm

247
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:08.88
playing on. But to me, I was in my opinion, I was feeling a much bigger purpose. You know, again,

248
00:23:08.88 --> 00:23:12.16
the things that you were just rattling off, whether it's, you know, sitting there on trapstand

249
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:16.56
by waiting for a metavacter get called in or an insertion or extraction. You know, you're just,

250
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.76
in my opinion, it was just way more high speed, low drag. So you're still doing your maintenance job.

251
00:23:23.76 --> 00:23:32.000
Yeah. And then your, your other job is when they launch some of the times they would need a

252
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
door gunner and they put you on the 50-cal. Yeah. Well, I mean, so it's a routine thing. So it

253
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.88
probably every other day. And once every three days I'd be flying. Okay. Yeah. So it was just like

254
00:23:40.88 --> 00:23:45.60
here, your schedule for flights these days. Yeah. And, and then what kind of missions were you

255
00:23:45.60 --> 00:23:50.000
guys supporting? It could be a broad spectrum of things. Yeah. I mean, some days it would be just your

256
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.44
generic like, resupplies or your drop-in-off mail, other times, you know, you're doing everything

257
00:23:55.44 --> 00:24:00.40
from drug grades to yeah, I mean, my favorites were the insertions and extractions for sure.

258
00:24:01.52 --> 00:24:07.20
And did you already knew how to shoot a 50-cal, but did they fan you up further once you

259
00:24:07.20 --> 00:24:11.68
started doing it from the heel? Oh yeah. I mean, I loved it. They got you dialed in. Yeah, because

260
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:17.60
the 50-cal is such a beautiful piece of machinery. Well, it was funny too. Well, man,

261
00:24:17.60 --> 00:24:22.64
when I first decided that I wanted to pick at my wings, like that was even more of a battle than

262
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:28.16
you know, even just being a maintainer. Like nobody wants to see a 5-3-blond lady, you know,

263
00:24:28.16 --> 00:24:32.16
drag in their knuckles and turn and rents as long as I had the dudes. And then now she steps up

264
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:35.84
and says she wants to do speed reloads with 85 pound cans and they start looking at you a little

265
00:24:35.84 --> 00:24:42.000
funny. So again, proving myself all over again, but I mean, I loved it. Like even when you go pick

266
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.92
up, you know, the boys from one seven or two five are something they'd just be looking at you.

267
00:24:45.92 --> 00:24:50.48
So funny with a little blonde ponytail hanging out the back of the flight helmet. I mean, I just

268
00:24:50.48 --> 00:24:56.08
yeah, I loved it. And then what? So every third day you're going out the other days you're working

269
00:24:56.80 --> 00:25:02.08
and the missions that you're supporting are everything. Everything. I mean, we would work with

270
00:25:02.08 --> 00:25:06.16
the Marines, we'd work with the Australians, we'd work with the Brits. I mean, the Georgians would work

271
00:25:06.16 --> 00:25:12.64
with everybody. How hot was the AOs that you were working in? Like, what was the threat level? How did

272
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:17.60
you feel? Did you feel? Were you ever at a point where like, oh yeah, we know we're going out,

273
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:23.60
we're no we're going to get contacted or was it the enemy was pretty tame in the areas you were going

274
00:25:23.60 --> 00:25:28.24
into? It was going to hit and mess. I would go back and forth. I mean, you mentioned the 53 earlier.

275
00:25:28.24 --> 00:25:33.36
I mean, we're a huge bumblebee. We're a huge target as it is. You know, certain areas, you know,

276
00:25:33.36 --> 00:25:39.04
Lashcarga, you know, I'm Lisa Kloan, all of that, like sure those areas, like for lack of better

277
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:43.68
terms. Yeah, I mean, you'd you'd pucker, like I mean, it's very real. I mean, other times, you know,

278
00:25:43.68 --> 00:25:53.60
going on a Dwyer, not so bad. And then the the did you start feeling any any like stress or were

279
00:25:53.60 --> 00:26:00.96
you like just in the zone? Well, it's weird. Like, I never really thought about getting hurt.

280
00:26:00.96 --> 00:26:05.20
Ever. I mean, I don't know if maybe it was a young mentality, but I mean, every day when I'd go pick

281
00:26:05.20 --> 00:26:10.08
up my bloodshit and you know, grab the gear and run out of the bird, it was, I mean, crashing or

282
00:26:10.08 --> 00:26:14.64
getting shut down or any of those things like never even crossed my mind. It was just,

283
00:26:14.64 --> 00:26:19.36
I'm going to go out there and do my job. And quite frankly, I mean, flying over, you know,

284
00:26:19.36 --> 00:26:24.88
anywhere, saying in or any of those areas, the greens on like Afghanistan is beautiful. Like,

285
00:26:24.88 --> 00:26:29.28
if you're not getting shot at, you're not terrified. Like, I mean, I loved it. I mean, it's

286
00:26:29.28 --> 00:26:33.52
just a stunning country. And then even just like the interaction that you get with some of the people,

287
00:26:33.52 --> 00:26:43.04
I mean, it's pretty special. Sometimes. So then you never expected, you never thought about it.

288
00:26:43.04 --> 00:26:45.52
You never thought about it. You never thought about getting blown out of the sky. You never thought

289
00:26:45.52 --> 00:26:51.76
about it any of this stuff. And then all of a sudden, let's talk about June 23rd, 2012. So

290
00:26:51.76 --> 00:26:56.56
what's the mission where you're going out on? So we were actually doing a resupply and then we were

291
00:26:56.56 --> 00:27:01.04
dropping off three space available army medics. And then we were going out bound to do an extraction

292
00:27:01.04 --> 00:27:05.84
of Marines. So a little bit of everything. I mean, that's pretty common. You just bundle it all together

293
00:27:05.84 --> 00:27:10.80
and try to meet the schedules that everybody needs. But I mean, honestly, it should have been fairly

294
00:27:10.80 --> 00:27:16.000
routine. So we were making our way to now Zad. And there's a little bit of stuff going on. Like,

295
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.08
we were getting spotlighted. So it's common out in Afghanistan where basically they try to

296
00:27:20.08 --> 00:27:24.32
bloom out the hull of the copper, so the pads can't see anyways. But they would basically signal

297
00:27:24.32 --> 00:27:27.52
to the next stations all the way out to wherever we were going. So they could figure out where we were

298
00:27:27.52 --> 00:27:34.72
landing. We were in route to now Zad and unfortunately never made it to who now Zad. We were supposed

299
00:27:34.72 --> 00:27:40.16
to be dropping off those three army medics and everything from ammo to mail and everything in between.

300
00:27:40.72 --> 00:27:46.40
And yeah, the last things that I remember was a pilot or my excuse me, my tail gunner calling

301
00:27:46.40 --> 00:27:53.76
for power. For the pilots to level the nose of the aircraft up are off. And pilot came over

302
00:27:53.76 --> 00:27:57.20
comms and said he wasn't getting the desired outputs. And the next thing, you know, we came

303
00:27:57.20 --> 00:28:04.32
nose up and then rolled left and being on the left gun night vision goggles down. It was weird.

304
00:28:04.32 --> 00:28:08.72
I just counted. Like, just like normally, like as a as a door gunner, you're the eyes and the

305
00:28:08.72 --> 00:28:12.72
ears for the pilot. So when you're landing, especially a big piece of machinery like that,

306
00:28:12.72 --> 00:28:17.52
it's 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 means on deck. And that's all I did. And then we hit the ground.

307
00:28:19.44 --> 00:28:22.72
You know, there's a lot more embellished stories out there. But yeah, not that bad.

308
00:28:22.72 --> 00:28:29.12
You remember all that stuff? Yeah. That's what I remember. There's a lot that I was knocked out.

309
00:28:30.24 --> 00:28:34.40
The assumption is the barrel of my 50 cow, which obviously sticks way up the side of the helicopter,

310
00:28:34.40 --> 00:28:39.20
hit the ground before I did and came up in through my face. So it has some pretty,

311
00:28:39.20 --> 00:28:43.92
pretty severe damage to my face and then my right front a lube. But yeah, I'm going to listen

312
00:28:43.92 --> 00:28:46.96
in out. Did you ever piece together with the pilots like what happened?

313
00:28:46.96 --> 00:28:54.48
I think I made in my opinion, you just choked. I mean, there was pressure. I mean, it was,

314
00:28:54.48 --> 00:28:59.76
you know, brown-out circumstances. We were being spotted. There was smaller stuff going on around

315
00:28:59.76 --> 00:29:06.56
us. Nothing that was a real threat to us by any means. But, you know, actually, my last memory of

316
00:29:06.56 --> 00:29:12.16
being an afghanist and on camp bastions, it'll make shit possible. I once had his name, but

317
00:29:12.16 --> 00:29:18.56
was the pilot sitting by my bedside and just sitting there and crying. And then I found out later

318
00:29:18.56 --> 00:29:24.32
that he actually deal with. So, and there's a lot of guilt there. I mean, I've forgiven the situation

319
00:29:24.32 --> 00:29:32.96
for sure. But yeah. So, the hero crashes and you're knocked out. What's your first memory

320
00:29:33.52 --> 00:29:39.04
of after being knocked out? So everybody, like my pilots were screaming for my tail gunner,

321
00:29:39.04 --> 00:29:46.64
and who, I mean, I just idolized this dude. And they couldn't find him. They couldn't get a reaction

322
00:29:46.64 --> 00:29:50.64
from him at first. So, I started screaming. Like, I'm hearing all this going on. And it's not real.

323
00:29:50.64 --> 00:29:55.12
I wasn't in pain. I wasn't in shock. I wasn't crying. It was just like, holy shit. Find my tail

324
00:29:55.12 --> 00:30:01.12
gunner. And I don't know the details of what exactly happened or how exactly it happened.

325
00:30:01.12 --> 00:30:05.36
But he ended up going at the back and hitting the river rocks before we actually hit the ground.

326
00:30:05.36 --> 00:30:09.28
I don't know if he was coming off of his gunner's belt to get to one of the three available seats

327
00:30:09.28 --> 00:30:14.08
on the other side of the aircraft or what he was doing. But he went up the back. And so I just

328
00:30:14.08 --> 00:30:19.28
started screaming to get a reaction, likely over time. They got a reaction from him. And like,

329
00:30:20.48 --> 00:30:25.12
all of it was just pure freaking chaos. But I remember like rolling my tongue around my mouth.

330
00:30:25.12 --> 00:30:28.88
Because I couldn't breathe out of my nose. And then we're no teeth. Everything was shattered.

331
00:30:28.88 --> 00:30:34.88
There's just like a big hole. And then it was just gurgling. Because I couldn't breathe out of my mouth.

332
00:30:34.88 --> 00:30:39.68
And one of the army medics actually crawled all over all of these trials that we had and got

333
00:30:39.68 --> 00:30:45.36
in my face. And I remember reading his patch. And he was just doing my face trying to keep me

334
00:30:45.36 --> 00:30:50.24
basically out of shock. And then they called in. It says, when my favorite story is so I hope second

335
00:30:50.24 --> 00:30:56.16
I'm Italian fifth moon is listening. But they called two five out of Nazad to come out and provide

336
00:30:56.16 --> 00:31:02.32
security. And obviously, you know, help with stripping everything down. And when they called it in,

337
00:31:02.32 --> 00:31:08.08
um, whoever said it, you know, said, you know, the female gunner that on impact. Because it couldn't

338
00:31:08.08 --> 00:31:13.36
get a response for me. Long search for it. They come out, you know, put me in the other craft or

339
00:31:13.36 --> 00:31:18.80
lead aircraft along with my tail gunner. And there's the crew and get us out of there and back to

340
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:24.48
camp bastion. Well, long search for it all fast for a little bit. Um, second time fifth marines

341
00:31:24.48 --> 00:31:28.32
ended up shooting these pistol rounds underwater when they, when that's done, they blew

342
00:31:28.32 --> 00:31:32.96
them out into flowers. And they got them back to me in this little wooden case and said for

343
00:31:32.96 --> 00:31:37.92
what, um, flowers that I don't ever die just like you. Um, but yeah, I mean, every single one of

344
00:31:37.92 --> 00:31:41.92
those dudes now to this day, like they laughed early, we didn't think it was true. I really bullshit.

345
00:31:41.92 --> 00:31:49.84
There's not a female on that aircraft. So, it was the, whenever I think of a helicopter crashing,

346
00:31:49.84 --> 00:31:57.60
I think of it exploding and being on fire. So, how did it not? Was it, what did it survive kind of

347
00:31:57.60 --> 00:32:07.60
intact? No. Okay. So, it was just, you know, so I actually have a little bit of, um, I, there was a

348
00:32:07.60 --> 00:32:11.92
g-boss out right outside and now is that. So, I have actually seen what happened when we hit the ground.

349
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:16.16
So, when we hit the ground, the transition, the transition came off and of course, like the

350
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:22.80
tailpile and everything just went flying. Um, the rotors and all of that. Um, but I mean, it wasn't

351
00:32:22.80 --> 00:32:27.12
salvageable. I mean, they just took the guns and a couple of other things off of it and then they just

352
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:34.16
blow it up. And you were the worst injury, worst casualty on the heel, right? Yes. And that's

353
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:39.36
probably because, like you said, you were the door gunner on the, on the left side and on the left side.

354
00:32:39.36 --> 00:32:43.52
And to be totally honest, probably just because of my size. I mean, my 50 cow on a gal 21

355
00:32:43.52 --> 00:32:49.36
mill, you know, sits up. Damn, no, my chest on me. So, you've got some pictures on your,

356
00:32:49.36 --> 00:32:57.76
I think it's your Facebook of your face and it's freaking crazy. I was like, holy, I mean, it is,

357
00:32:57.76 --> 00:33:05.20
it's like fully exposed. Like, your, your, your, your, your, your, her bad, yeah, bad. And um,

358
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.92
so, so what then once your next memory, once your next memory, did they put you in a induced

359
00:33:09.92 --> 00:33:15.12
coma? What they do with you? No, they didn't give me any medicine. Oh, piss me off. I saw

360
00:33:15.12 --> 00:33:23.84
so much pain. Does I woke back up, um, in round two camp, bastion. And this dude, calm stock. He was

361
00:33:23.84 --> 00:33:30.48
the, the new left door gunner on the other aircraft. He bent on next to me. And he just basically told me

362
00:33:30.48 --> 00:33:34.48
he's like, don't close your fucking eyes because you're not going to open him again. And um,

363
00:33:34.48 --> 00:33:39.36
my tail gunner, my old gunner, he's sergeant. It was actually laying next to me because we were just

364
00:33:39.36 --> 00:33:43.60
laying on the floorboard of the aircraft. And he kept throwing his arm over my face to keep from

365
00:33:43.60 --> 00:33:48.16
getting hydraulic and fluid and stuff. All in my open wounds and whatnot. And so I'm laying there

366
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:52.000
and I'm trying not to cry. I'm panicking that like I'm going to die of that same little sister

367
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.28
because I have no idea what's going on. Like I was numb. I knew I was hurt, but I didn't really,

368
00:33:57.28 --> 00:34:01.60
I was weird. I couldn't feel anything. And then I just kept staring at this blue cabin over

369
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:05.76
headlight and thinking I wasn't going to die of that same little sister. What about your leg? Did

370
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:10.16
you, did you, what do you aware that your leg was jacked up? I was well aware that I was jacked up

371
00:34:10.16 --> 00:34:14.24
because that was, I mean, I wasn't paying like that's the only thing that actually hurt.

372
00:34:14.24 --> 00:34:20.96
For whatever reason, like I could feel that in nothing else. Yeah, that was just, that was pretty brutal.

373
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:26.72
But yeah, then they got me back to camp bastion. And I remember thinking like,

374
00:34:28.08 --> 00:34:31.04
that's fucking fine. Like they're just going to sew me back up. And I'm going to go right back to this.

375
00:34:31.04 --> 00:34:35.60
Like out were almost on our way out. We're going to, you know, go home and August. It's totally fine.

376
00:34:35.60 --> 00:34:40.96
And then my gunnery sergeant, the one who asked me to go on that deployment. My sergeant

377
00:34:40.96 --> 00:34:46.08
major at the time walked in and they were looking at me and they're both crying and just staring at me.

378
00:34:46.08 --> 00:34:53.04
I'm like, oh shit. This is, this is not good. And I think that's when I realized like I was going home.

379
00:34:54.72 --> 00:35:00.40
And yeah, I mean, I was devastated. I think that was the hardest part of any of it was just having to leave

380
00:35:00.40 --> 00:35:04.96
everybody behind. I mean, even once I left camp bastion, you know, they said me to candle hard,

381
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:10.56
Germany, D.C. and then I made it back to San Diego. And I had been, I had just been combat

382
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:18.56
meritoriously promoted to sergeant. And then... When you're getting the whole evacuation to Germany,

383
00:35:18.56 --> 00:35:23.20
are people meeting with you? Are you starting to get a glimpse or are feeling for what's going on?

384
00:35:23.20 --> 00:35:32.56
Yes, and no. I mean, I knew what was going on. I didn't quite understand obviously the whole process.

385
00:35:32.56 --> 00:35:37.12
But I was pissed off and I wasn't really letting anyone help or explain to me anything.

386
00:35:38.72 --> 00:35:43.20
Actually, it didn't really help the situation. Sorry, Mom. But when I was in, it would have

387
00:35:43.20 --> 00:35:48.48
been Germany or candle hard. They finally let me call home because of course my CEO gets a

388
00:35:48.48 --> 00:35:53.60
hold of my parents and my dad answers the phone well. Eventually I can call home. But I can't talk

389
00:35:53.60 --> 00:36:00.08
because there's no genre or anything. So I'm trying to tell my mom like I'm coming home and my mom

390
00:36:00.08 --> 00:36:03.68
starts laughing at me and she's like, you know, baby girl, I can understand you must be on some

391
00:36:03.68 --> 00:36:09.12
really good drugs and I get pissed. I do mom and I hang up the phone on her. And then I don't talk

392
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:14.40
to anybody. Like I'm not mad. And then, you know, they're loading me up, like, and pissed off

393
00:36:14.40 --> 00:36:20.72
at my mom. I'm anger that I'm even my dudes. Like, I'm just, I'm just a shitshow. And then they

394
00:36:20.72 --> 00:36:25.52
load me up to actually, they don't have me and do. They don't have me sedated or anything. They

395
00:36:25.52 --> 00:36:29.84
load me up in Germany to send me to DC. Why don't they have you induced? Is it because you had

396
00:36:29.84 --> 00:36:33.44
brain trauma or something? Yeah. So they wouldn't give me anything for pain right off the bat,

397
00:36:33.44 --> 00:36:40.08
especially because of the head trauma. But yeah. So then from Germany, somebody that was just in a

398
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:45.52
helicopter crash, they don't put them to sleep for a flight from Germany to DC. And so then I'm on this

399
00:36:45.52 --> 00:36:48.72
thing. Like, they have me strapped down to a gurney. There's a bunch of other dudes with like,

400
00:36:48.72 --> 00:36:52.88
they'll legs blown off. People sitting on the sides of the aircraft, like just staring at me as I'm

401
00:36:52.88 --> 00:36:59.12
losing my mind. My lungs are sticking together. So it can't breathe. I mean, it was, it was a terrible

402
00:36:59.12 --> 00:37:04.80
terrible journey back. Let's put it that way. But I think once I made it to DC and they, you know,

403
00:37:04.80 --> 00:37:08.32
they're carrying us all off on the stretchers and stuff like that. And, you know, there's American

404
00:37:08.32 --> 00:37:12.96
flags and supporters and people out there, you know, telling you that it's going to be okay. I

405
00:37:12.96 --> 00:37:19.68
think in that moment, like, I realized that I was going to be okay. But it still didn't quite.

406
00:37:19.68 --> 00:37:24.88
I think I was scared of what was going happen. You know, basically that I wouldn't be able to stay in.

407
00:37:25.84 --> 00:37:29.92
That was the fear. That was the fear. The fear that you couldn't, you wouldn't be able to stay in

408
00:37:29.92 --> 00:37:33.12
the Marine Corps. How long had you been in for at this point? Four years.

409
00:37:33.12 --> 00:37:40.000
Just made sergeant. Yep. Were your parents waiting for you when you got to DC?

410
00:37:40.72 --> 00:37:45.76
No, they're waiting for me in San Diego. So it was hard for them to decide, you know, of course,

411
00:37:45.76 --> 00:37:50.72
both Marines being our both parents being Marines. It's not a ton of money floating around my family.

412
00:37:50.72 --> 00:37:55.52
So they, you know, we need to do a wait to figure out if I was going to be a poly trauma in DC,

413
00:37:55.52 --> 00:38:00.000
our poly trauma in San Diego. So as soon as we got word that I was going to go to San Diego,

414
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.84
that's when they like sold everything in the house. You know, we loaded up in the car and

415
00:38:03.84 --> 00:38:07.44
are they loaded up in the car and they made it out of San Diego. Did they actually sell their house?

416
00:38:07.44 --> 00:38:13.52
No, they did everything in it, literally everything in it. And we're, they down and forward to

417
00:38:13.52 --> 00:38:17.68
still. Yeah. So they sold everything that they had to float up. How long were you in DC for?

418
00:38:17.68 --> 00:38:22.88
Not too long. I mean, I maybe a handful of days, four, five days. And then straight to Balbo.

419
00:38:24.40 --> 00:38:28.32
And what do you think in at this point in terms of the level of your injuries? Have you seen

420
00:38:28.32 --> 00:38:31.68
yourself in a mirror yet? Because if I would have seen the picture that you posted,

421
00:38:32.80 --> 00:38:37.92
that would have hit me pretty damn hard. Well, so that's actually why they took those pictures.

422
00:38:37.92 --> 00:38:40.80
So it was actually really cute when when I got what was in San Cue.

423
00:38:40.80 --> 00:38:44.64
I don't know what's cute about this. You had a hole in your face. No.

424
00:38:45.44 --> 00:38:51.60
So when they wheeled me in, again, this little makeshift hospital tent. There was actually a

425
00:38:51.60 --> 00:38:56.64
British plastic surgeon that was volunteering or time. This little suy, she was old, like an old

426
00:38:56.64 --> 00:39:01.20
lady. And she looked at everybody in there and was like, no one touch her. I'm so in her back up.

427
00:39:01.20 --> 00:39:07.12
So it was, you know, as far as my face goes. And so she took those pictures. And when I finally

428
00:39:07.12 --> 00:39:12.000
came to after she sewed my face up initially, she was like, I don't want you to freak out when you

429
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.20
see this. Like, this is what we started with. And so that's where those pictures actually came from.

430
00:39:18.48 --> 00:39:25.76
No, that's their savage. Yeah. But so you saw those pretty quickly. Yeah. But then you got to see

431
00:39:25.76 --> 00:39:29.68
she did a damn good job. Yeah. I mean, it's like a miracle. She was a miracle or something.

432
00:39:29.68 --> 00:39:34.16
Lady. I'm just so thankful. A corpsman didn't touch me. My team was being a human eye.

433
00:39:34.16 --> 00:39:38.40
You had to had a E3 corpsman. Yeah, that would have been better. That would have not been good.

434
00:39:39.20 --> 00:39:43.20
No offense to E3 corpsman. They're doing their best. But, you know, obviously,

435
00:39:43.20 --> 00:39:48.88
a some experienced plastic surgeon is going to do a better job. Yeah. I was out of rough.

436
00:39:48.88 --> 00:39:52.40
So, so that's good. How about your leg? When are you feeling in your leg?

437
00:39:52.40 --> 00:39:58.72
So, my leg, I knew was a bad deal from the get go. So, they had no body would touch it. No one

438
00:39:58.72 --> 00:40:04.88
overseas, he would even was willing to mess with that. What had happened to it? So, when we hit

439
00:40:04.88 --> 00:40:10.72
the ground, there's a bone in the middle of your foot called a tailist. It snapped and shot everything

440
00:40:10.72 --> 00:40:13.76
up. So, damn, it's just the heel and up through like my tip to have been everything.

441
00:40:15.20 --> 00:40:19.52
Something, I don't know what it was. I mean, obviously, they have steel to a boot. So, we fly in and

442
00:40:19.52 --> 00:40:24.32
all of that. But, yeah, something was underneath it with enough force that it broke everything

443
00:40:24.32 --> 00:40:32.40
upward and pushed everything up. And, what does it look like on the outside? Is it like a compound

444
00:40:32.40 --> 00:40:37.84
fractures at all internal damage? No, I mean, it was all internal damage. I mean,

445
00:40:37.84 --> 00:40:42.000
everything. I mean, there was no, from my leg, there was no blood. Did it seem, because it

446
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.56
seems to me that that would, like if I had that happen, like, oh, it hurts a lot, but it's all

447
00:40:46.56 --> 00:40:51.60
there. There's no blood. I'm going to be good. That would be my opinion, because I'm kind of,

448
00:40:52.24 --> 00:40:57.76
I always think I'm going to survive everything. Yeah, no, I hear it. No, like, well, I think what

449
00:40:57.76 --> 00:41:01.52
worried me was, like I said, the fact that everybody was looking at it and being like,

450
00:41:02.32 --> 00:41:05.92
we're not going to do anything about it. And nobody did anything about it for like a week,

451
00:41:05.92 --> 00:41:10.88
ten days. And then, finally, someone came in and said, well, this is what your deal is,

452
00:41:10.88 --> 00:41:15.84
because of the damage that has been caused. You've disrupted all of the blood flow to those bones.

453
00:41:15.84 --> 00:41:20.80
So those bones are going to have a vast enough process, and they're all going to die. And I opted

454
00:41:20.80 --> 00:41:25.60
for the doctors to not cut it off right away. I told them, like, look, let's fix my spine.

455
00:41:25.60 --> 00:41:30.40
Let's fix my face. Let's fix my fucking brain. And then, making a worry about my leg. And

456
00:41:31.60 --> 00:41:37.12
so let's go through that order. The face, they sew you up, did a great job with that.

457
00:41:38.08 --> 00:41:42.32
Your brain. So you got knocked out. You got, I mean, you got,

458
00:41:42.32 --> 00:41:47.92
wailed on. Your head got wailed on in this accident. What do you got? You get headaches?

459
00:41:47.92 --> 00:41:51.44
Is your memory? What, what would the symptoms that you noticed out of the gate?

460
00:41:53.12 --> 00:41:56.48
The biggest thing, right? I mean, currently, the biggest thing is still my memory. Like, I mean,

461
00:41:56.48 --> 00:42:00.48
I have solid chunks of it. And I like made a really conscious effort and thank God for,

462
00:42:00.48 --> 00:42:07.04
again, my mom, my sister and my dad for really working with me for that stuff. But for a while,

463
00:42:07.04 --> 00:42:11.76
I mean, it was, I mean, everything. The biggest thing was being able to control my mood. I had a

464
00:42:11.76 --> 00:42:16.80
real issue with mood stabilization. There was just like a constant anxiety no matter what. And then

465
00:42:16.80 --> 00:42:21.44
I couldn't sleep. So of course, all of those things together on top of like word recognition

466
00:42:21.44 --> 00:42:25.76
and word retrieval and being able to communicate effectively with doctors or your parents or friends,

467
00:42:25.76 --> 00:42:30.56
like what you need. That was the hardest part. And then like, I don't know if you've ever been

468
00:42:30.56 --> 00:42:36.64
down to Valbo, but I mean, they had this whole building for their patients to live. And so I lived in,

469
00:42:36.64 --> 00:42:41.52
I mean, it was just like a little bedroom. Like a little tiny condo thing. But I could go into the

470
00:42:41.52 --> 00:42:45.92
bathroom and just not know what the hell was going on. Like I had to be reminded that if I'm in the

471
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:52.08
bathroom, I'm taking a shower, but she might take the washing my hands. So like I had to have a very

472
00:42:52.08 --> 00:42:55.68
specific routine to be able to like get all pistons firing.

473
00:42:58.48 --> 00:43:05.12
Is that, did you, did you notice progress over time? Oh yeah. So you could you see the progress?

474
00:43:05.12 --> 00:43:09.52
I guess is what I'm asking. Or were you just like, what is this not getting any better?

475
00:43:09.52 --> 00:43:15.68
The first year, I really, really struggled because you get frustrated. You compare yourself to

476
00:43:15.68 --> 00:43:21.52
how you were, whether that's physically, mentally or emotionally. It's just, if it's not one thing,

477
00:43:21.52 --> 00:43:27.36
it's another. So I was the first year was really, really difficult, but once I made it over that hump,

478
00:43:27.36 --> 00:43:31.84
I mean, I'm pretty broad to say that it's been like, and I've tried like hell. I've given this

479
00:43:31.84 --> 00:43:37.84
everything that I have that has been like on a constant upswing at this point. I mean, I still

480
00:43:37.84 --> 00:43:42.000
would have speech therapy to this day, but I mean, that helps with everything from cognitive to,

481
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.76
again, just the verbal stuff too. But I mean, it's, it's work. How about the cervical spine? What,

482
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:54.72
like, what was the, what you feeling numbness in your body parts or anything like that? Like, I had,

483
00:43:54.72 --> 00:44:00.16
I had neck surgery because I hurt my spine. And like I had woke up one day and I, in the middle

484
00:44:00.16 --> 00:44:04.96
night, I couldn't move my right arm. Like, it would not move, which isn't really scary thing. And,

485
00:44:04.96 --> 00:44:09.84
you know, eventually it all came back, but what, what was your cervical spine injury? Did you break

486
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:16.40
vertebrae? So there was herelin fractures in my C2C3 and C4. And then just from the, so like,

487
00:44:16.40 --> 00:44:21.52
being in the air craft, there are these, I mean, there are tethers. I mean, they go around your ribcage

488
00:44:21.52 --> 00:44:25.60
and tether you to the floor board, so you don't go flying anywhere, or should it hollow copper crash or something

489
00:44:25.60 --> 00:44:30.88
happened. And so when we hit the ground, it was like the hollow cup, it went one way and I went the other.

490
00:44:30.88 --> 00:44:38.08
And so it kind of just like, I guess, be severe, whip last. Beggah, whip last. Yeah. And so then my,

491
00:44:38.72 --> 00:44:44.48
C2C3 and C4 did what's called stepping. So they were basically, say exact, one was out of place.

492
00:44:44.48 --> 00:44:51.36
So that was for that way. Did, but it didn't, did it affect your spinal cord at all? No. No.

493
00:44:51.36 --> 00:44:58.88
I, I like to gain a millimetres right there too. And I, that was scary. Let me just put it that way. And I mean,

494
00:44:58.88 --> 00:45:03.28
I, I didn't know what to do in that moment either because now you're playing with, again,

495
00:45:03.28 --> 00:45:07.92
no offense to millimetres. And I'm super thankful that I am where I am today. But now you're looking at this

496
00:45:07.92 --> 00:45:12.24
situation where it's like, is it that bad to fix it? You know, do you let them go on and do surgery or

497
00:45:12.24 --> 00:45:18.24
do you let it heal on its own? Do you live your life in a cease-bying for the next year or two? And so yeah,

498
00:45:18.24 --> 00:45:23.28
I mean, that's just a huge gamble with all of it. So what called did you make? I lived in a cease-bying

499
00:45:23.28 --> 00:45:28.72
for a long time. So you lived in a dang, that big thing that you wear around your neck? So yeah, you're not

500
00:45:28.72 --> 00:45:34.08
turning it and you're not moving your shoulders around your neck. You're doing nothing. Yeah.

501
00:45:35.44 --> 00:45:40.80
And then, you know, obviously, damage to the arms, the head drum will also like mess up the back side of my

502
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:44.40
right eye. Of course, you're your drum. You're going to get blown out and all that good stuff and how

503
00:45:44.40 --> 00:45:48.96
look up your crash. But the hardest part for me, I know, I think all two of them people look at me.

504
00:45:48.96 --> 00:45:53.28
Like, oh, God, she's missing her left leg that has to be terrible. But the reality is if I didn't

505
00:45:53.28 --> 00:45:58.16
keep my head in my heart in the right place, then nothing else was going to get better. So fixing,

506
00:45:58.16 --> 00:46:03.44
fixing my brain and fixing what I had going on emotionally. That was the hard part.

507
00:46:04.48 --> 00:46:10.32
So you're in the hospital for like, how long are you in the hospital for? Two years.

508
00:46:10.32 --> 00:46:20.56
Two years from 2012 to 2014. When you're when you're going through one of the things that you

509
00:46:20.56 --> 00:46:27.20
talk about is you're going through your anniversary, is it called an anniversary? You're a live day,

510
00:46:28.64 --> 00:46:34.64
a year after. And you got to a point where you're like, I don't know if I can do this.

511
00:46:34.64 --> 00:46:45.92
Yeah. So I think my doctors and my leadership, if you will, I had a lot of people come into my

512
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:50.40
hospital room and sit there and tell me, I wanted to go to the drill field so bad, so freaking bad.

513
00:46:51.60 --> 00:46:58.08
So I had all of these people coming. I even had the CG of MCRD come over and say,

514
00:46:58.08 --> 00:47:01.44
you're going to be the first drill instructor that's an MPT and you're going to go right back

515
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:06.24
into the fight and this, that and the other and on one hand, I used that to really push myself

516
00:47:06.24 --> 00:47:10.56
physically to get better, but on the other hand, I think it messed that misled me quite a bit.

517
00:47:11.44 --> 00:47:17.60
So when I got word after my second med board that I was unfit for duty,

518
00:47:17.60 --> 00:47:23.44
two to the injuries, I lost it. That's when I knew that I had one more shot at staying in the

519
00:47:23.44 --> 00:47:28.08
Marine Corps and it wasn't going to ever be to fly again. I was going to be the desk job that I

520
00:47:28.08 --> 00:47:34.56
really didn't want from the get-go and even still, I mean that wasn't even promised. So I don't know.

521
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:39.12
I deal with injuries in specific the main leg that's not getting better. Obviously,

522
00:47:39.12 --> 00:47:43.76
still processing a ton of stuff and then finding out that this, the one thing that I really

523
00:47:43.76 --> 00:47:48.88
loved at that point in time, my purpose, was now getting pulled out from underneath my feet.

524
00:47:50.72 --> 00:47:56.32
Yeah, I mean, I guess you, you have to hit rock bottom, you know, to be able to rebuild everything

525
00:47:56.32 --> 00:48:06.72
and I truly did. You got a couple of things in here that that you wrote about just like your,

526
00:48:06.72 --> 00:48:11.12
your mom, your dad. He said, my dad's been one of my best friends and biggest friends since day one.

527
00:48:11.12 --> 00:48:17.28
He's given me tough love after injury, but also motivated me in ways to continue creating and chasing

528
00:48:17.28 --> 00:48:23.36
dreams. I'm alive and well. Thanks to my family. I appreciate you being as stubborn as I am, Dad.

529
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:29.68
You, you, you, uh, talk about your mom. He said, my mom used to look at me sitting in my wheelchair

530
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:38.24
and say, do it your damn self. That right there has got to be for a parent and I got four

531
00:48:38.24 --> 00:48:44.40
kids, but the temptation for parents always is to try and just take give your kids everything that

532
00:48:44.40 --> 00:48:50.40
you can to help them. And that, I've said many times, actually, hurts your kid and here's an example,

533
00:48:50.40 --> 00:48:56.48
not of a child, but of hit of your mom talking to a 20, whatever three-year-old woman

534
00:48:57.92 --> 00:49:04.40
and saying, you got to do this yourself. That has to leave a mark. Yeah, I am. I mean, I'm not a

535
00:49:04.40 --> 00:49:10.24
parent, so I don't, I don't totally get that, you know, that side of things, but I mean, my dad,

536
00:49:11.60 --> 00:49:17.60
again, one of the things, I mean, I'll get into the nitty-goody of it because I'm transparent,

537
00:49:17.60 --> 00:49:22.32
but so on, June 23, 2012, like, if you're going to kill yourself, you're not going to,

538
00:49:22.32 --> 00:49:28.000
you're not going to tell anybody. You're just going to go off and do it. And so I went down to

539
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.88
the Blife River and had some friends with me because we're going to celebrate and all this stuff.

540
00:49:32.88 --> 00:49:38.96
And then I decided that I'm over it, like, I don't want to be doing it anymore. Do what I need to do,

541
00:49:38.96 --> 00:49:44.08
and I'm going to walk myself out into the Blife River and drive myself disappear and no one's

542
00:49:44.08 --> 00:49:48.24
going to have to deal with me or my problems. I'm not going to be a burden anymore.

543
00:49:50.08 --> 00:49:55.84
Long search for it. I'm lucky that I woke up the next day. It's surrounded by people that did save

544
00:49:55.84 --> 00:50:05.12
me and my dad came to me and crying. My dad doesn't cry. My dad's this big tattoo dude. That's

545
00:50:05.12 --> 00:50:09.68
some of my scary sometimes. And he said, you've got to be shit in me. You know, the enemy couldn't kill

546
00:50:09.68 --> 00:50:14.40
you. You made it home. Now you're going to do it for him. And that's the moment I realized that I was

547
00:50:14.40 --> 00:50:18.96
being selfish. Some moment that I realized that I had a lot more to live for and that I had a lot to be

548
00:50:18.96 --> 00:50:26.80
grateful for. So then I decided that I was going to turn my life around. But I mean, I don't know

549
00:50:27.92 --> 00:50:33.20
what that's like for my dad. Especially like he's always been hard on me. He's always been the

550
00:50:33.20 --> 00:50:38.16
one to really set those standards for me. I mean, pun intended like he's the reason that I hold,

551
00:50:38.16 --> 00:50:43.12
you know, he holds my foot to the fire for me. And even to this day, like he doesn't do interviews.

552
00:50:43.12 --> 00:50:49.28
You know, I'm constantly like doing media stuff here and there. But, you know, one day he was asked,

553
00:50:49.28 --> 00:50:53.52
you know, are you proud of your daughter? And he's like, well, yeah, I'm proud of her. But the moment

554
00:50:53.52 --> 00:50:58.32
she stops paying it forward, she deserves it. I'll take it away. And I have lived my life like that.

555
00:50:58.32 --> 00:51:03.76
You know, those little one liners, it's sometimes look at my dad and I'm like, oh, like, thanks.

556
00:51:03.76 --> 00:51:08.40
But you know, like I hang on to those. And I mean, he really is. He's the one that holds me accountable

557
00:51:08.40 --> 00:51:11.76
like through and through through all of it. And then my mom, God love her.

558
00:51:11.76 --> 00:51:18.80
Toffers lady, I know. Because again, even like raising me. But then for her to like, I mean, I could see it.

559
00:51:18.80 --> 00:51:21.84
Even those moments when she's telling me to do it myself, like there's tears in her eyes. Like she

560
00:51:21.84 --> 00:51:25.84
wants to do it for me. But she knows the moment that she steps in and, and, you know,

561
00:51:25.84 --> 00:51:29.04
cuddles the situation. I'm not going to be independent. You know, I'm not going to move past these

562
00:51:29.04 --> 00:51:35.84
injuries and live a healthy, happy life. So I mean, I can't imagine the internal, like, turmoil that

563
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:43.52
you go through and I'm going to start the battle. And for you to go through this, like, actual 180 degree

564
00:51:43.52 --> 00:51:52.08
transition from, I don't want to live anymore to, I want to live the best life I possibly can.

565
00:51:53.36 --> 00:51:57.68
Well, how long did that transition take? This is like a couple days that you went,

566
00:51:57.68 --> 00:52:03.12
got there. When your dad said those words to you, you just said, you know what? I'm wrong.

567
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.96
And I need to get on the right path. That's it. He said, I mean, I think I think in that moment, I

568
00:52:11.60 --> 00:52:17.12
throw whatever reason. I mean, I'll never understand it. But for whatever reason, at that time,

569
00:52:17.12 --> 00:52:21.44
God spared me twice. And I'm not even a religious person. But God spared me twice. So obviously,

570
00:52:21.44 --> 00:52:28.48
there's a reason that I'm still here. Somebody is something cut me here. And then the dude that I,

571
00:52:28.48 --> 00:52:32.16
you know, was just back to the admire the most coming to me and saying that, like, I mean,

572
00:52:32.16 --> 00:52:37.60
that just destroyed me. I mean, as if I couldn't get any lower, you know, him saying that I was like,

573
00:52:37.60 --> 00:52:43.68
you know what? You decide. Like, I can't control the Holocaust or crash. I can't control what

574
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:48.000
this crazy vicious world threw out me. I can't control that. But what I can't control is how I'm

575
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.20
going to respond. And it is. I mean, I, I wholeheartedly believe as a choice.

576
00:52:55.92 --> 00:53:02.08
When you were not to dwell in the subject too long, but, you know, the lot of people that listen to

577
00:53:02.08 --> 00:53:09.04
this podcast are people that served and people that end up in some rough spots. When you were

578
00:53:09.04 --> 00:53:15.68
descending into that place mentally, how long did that take? I mean, is it something that you woke

579
00:53:15.68 --> 00:53:20.80
up one day and said, I'm sick of this or is it was like just the grind that beat you down over time.

580
00:53:20.80 --> 00:53:26.000
We said, look, this is just not worth it right now. I was the grind. I mean, it's not, I mean,

581
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
it's not an instant thing. I mean, again, don't get me wrong. I'm not the person that walked

582
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.96
trying to talk to about it. Like, you know, I wasn't screaming for attention. I was just going to

583
00:53:32.96 --> 00:53:38.56
go and do it. But I mean, it was just one of those things where it felt like nothing was ever getting

584
00:53:38.56 --> 00:53:43.20
better. You know, it was just digging this whole digging this grave, you know, deeper and deeper.

585
00:53:43.20 --> 00:53:50.08
You know, I asked you about the progress of your injury. That was like actually a really personal

586
00:53:50.08 --> 00:53:59.68
question for me because I'm the type of person. If I notice 0.001% improvement is something, I'm like,

587
00:53:59.68 --> 00:54:05.04
oh, there you go. See? I'm not right. This is going to get better. And when I don't have that happening,

588
00:54:05.04 --> 00:54:10.40
that's that's like, when I don't have that happening, I, it's like, when I don't notice any

589
00:54:10.40 --> 00:54:14.80
improvement, I, I start feeling like, oh, no, like I can see, I'm on the wrong path right now. This is

590
00:54:14.80 --> 00:54:19.20
not going to get better. It's kind of like how I felt with with my neck, my neck, I've jacked up all

591
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:22.80
of this and I can't move my arm all sudden. You know, it's going to get better. It's going to get better.

592
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:32.24
It's not getting better. And yeah, that's the grind thing of like, hey, this is getting worse.

593
00:54:32.24 --> 00:54:37.60
And it's not going to get better. And for me, like, now when I look at like, I never recovered

594
00:54:37.60 --> 00:54:42.88
the strength that I have in my, in my right tricep and my right pack. Like, I got some of it back,

595
00:54:42.88 --> 00:54:47.44
but not all of it. And it's okay. At some point, I just was like, okay, cool. That's the way it is.

596
00:54:47.44 --> 00:54:53.20
And I think that happens to people where you have to, you have to look at the situation and say,

597
00:54:53.20 --> 00:54:56.64
well, it's what you just said, listen, I can't control that. I can't control what happened.

598
00:54:56.64 --> 00:54:58.80
I can't control what happened. I can't control what happened. This helicopter crash.

599
00:54:58.80 --> 00:55:04.88
What happened happened? What are we going to do now? And I got that. I was actually getting some

600
00:55:04.88 --> 00:55:11.68
social media responses about it. Just someone is talking about, so I mean, my buddy,

601
00:55:11.68 --> 00:55:14.96
life, who is on the seal teams with, we wrote a book called Extreme Ownership and it's like,

602
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:18.96
you take ownership of everything in your world. Right? And there's people that will say,

603
00:55:20.32 --> 00:55:24.16
oh, if you get cancer, how you're going to take ownership of that, how is that? Because, yeah,

604
00:55:24.16 --> 00:55:26.88
when something goes wrong, it's my fault. That's, that's the way I look at things. Right?

605
00:55:26.88 --> 00:55:30.72
When something goes wrong, it's my fault. That's the way I look at everything. If something's

606
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:38.32
not going the way it should be, it's my fault. So how do you take ownership if you get cancer?

607
00:55:38.32 --> 00:55:42.80
Like how do you take ownership of that? And the answer is, you don't take ownership

608
00:55:42.80 --> 00:55:48.88
for getting cancer. That's not, that's not, but you take ownership for how you're going to react to it.

609
00:55:48.88 --> 00:55:53.92
You take ownership for your response. You can't take ownership. Look, the hellow crashed.

610
00:55:53.92 --> 00:55:57.60
What, for whatever reason, it could be a million different things that that he'll crash to. He'll

611
00:55:57.60 --> 00:56:03.28
crash. You, okay, what do you do? You can't take ownership of that crash. What you take ownership

612
00:56:03.28 --> 00:56:08.56
of is your response to that, your response to your injuries. And that's to me is the most powerful

613
00:56:08.56 --> 00:56:14.80
thing that a person has because that gives you some level of control over circumstances that are

614
00:56:14.80 --> 00:56:21.44
truly beyond your control. Yep. I mean, I've said it from pretty much since June 23rd,

615
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:25.60
to 2013, you know, the right actions follow the right perspectives. I mean, I could sit here

616
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:31.20
and I could bitch about everything that I've lost. I could bitch about, you know, lost memory,

617
00:56:31.20 --> 00:56:34.72
a lost leg, a lost military career, a lost years of my life, you know, to the hospital and to

618
00:56:34.72 --> 00:56:39.36
recovery, where I can look at what I've gained. How does not happen? I wouldn't be sitting here with you.

619
00:56:39.36 --> 00:56:43.68
I wouldn't be doing the things that I'm doing. I wouldn't be living this very different purpose

620
00:56:43.68 --> 00:56:48.24
on a totally different platform than I was before. So I can take it with a grain of salt.

621
00:56:48.24 --> 00:56:51.84
Look at it as a blessing and a curse, one that I, my curse that I wouldn't wish on.

622
00:56:51.84 --> 00:56:56.24
Anyone, my own were said to me, and then, you know, I can just keep going about my day.

623
00:56:57.12 --> 00:57:03.84
It's just, it's that. At what point? So, so now, your two years in the hospital. So,

624
00:57:03.84 --> 00:57:09.92
2014, you get out of the hospital and you start living. Is that when you get medically retired?

625
00:57:09.92 --> 00:57:16.16
Yeah. May 2014. May 2014, you get out. And what are you doing? You get out? What's your,

626
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:20.56
what are you, what are you moving to? Are you living in San Diego at this time? Yeah.

627
00:57:21.76 --> 00:57:24.16
Living in OB. Oh yeah.

628
00:57:26.96 --> 00:57:33.76
No, so there is two, so I mean, I got it growing up again, that academic thing and that, that athletic thing.

629
00:57:34.72 --> 00:57:38.24
I didn't struggle with it. And now I find myself in this position, getting out of the ring

630
00:57:38.24 --> 00:57:42.000
core. I'm like, I'm not the same person that I knew physically and I'm definitely not the

631
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.48
same person I knew mentally. But I really wanted to finish my first masters. And while I was still

632
00:57:48.48 --> 00:57:51.44
in, the doctors looked at me and they were like, there's no way that we're going to prove you

633
00:57:51.44 --> 00:57:54.80
for tuition assistance or any of that. Like, you're going to fail your classes. There's no way.

634
00:57:54.80 --> 00:57:58.48
Are you serious? Yeah. Well, so I went to my speech therapist and said, hey, can you download

635
00:57:58.48 --> 00:58:02.24
this program, read and write gold onto my computer? I'm going to figure this out. Like, I'm going

636
00:58:02.24 --> 00:58:08.56
to finish this last year. My masters ended up getting that masters in psychology with a sea average.

637
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:14.08
So barely. But I was like determined to prove those doctors wrong. And every single one of

638
00:58:14.08 --> 00:58:17.76
them kept telling me, if you don't use it, you're going to lose it. Like, you have to continue

639
00:58:17.76 --> 00:58:22.08
training and rewiring your brain. So then I just, I didn't stop. I just kept going to school

640
00:58:22.08 --> 00:58:26.48
like the moment that I got out, I was just kept going. And obviously, I used this post in 11G.

641
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:30.08
I built on the integrated back in up scholarship. So I did school like,

642
00:58:31.44 --> 00:58:35.84
wholeheartedly. So this is 2014. You get out of the hospital. You're like diving into

643
00:58:35.84 --> 00:58:40.88
school hardcore. You keep talking about going to speech therapy. And I've been listening

644
00:58:40.88 --> 00:58:45.76
really intently trying to figure out why you need speech therapy. And I found nothing so far.

645
00:58:46.48 --> 00:58:51.20
Super articulate, you know, nailing every word, pronouncing, pronouncing everything.

646
00:58:51.92 --> 00:58:58.40
Awesome. So what was like your lowest point for speech? Was it because the damage had been done to your

647
00:58:58.40 --> 00:59:06.48
jaw? Was it your brain damage? Or was it just both? And how bad was it? Was it a point where, you know,

648
00:59:06.48 --> 00:59:10.08
you weren't able to carry on a conversation? Yeah. So in the very beginning. Because that's

649
00:59:10.08 --> 00:59:15.12
face it right now. You're doing a damn good job. Thank you. No, so in the very beginning, it really

650
00:59:15.12 --> 00:59:20.56
was. It was getting my brain to fire to be able to express myself to again, to retrieve the

651
00:59:20.56 --> 00:59:26.88
words that I was actually looking for. Now it's more of like nerve and all of that, the trauma,

652
00:59:26.88 --> 00:59:30.72
like the physical trauma. Now it's like, I was trying not to point it out. But like, ours and

653
00:59:30.72 --> 00:59:37.20
S's, I'll try to avoid that. But yeah, you just said both of them perfectly. The sound.

654
00:59:38.16 --> 00:59:44.48
You make, but yeah, like actually when I was trying to say rewiring, just now, there's a lot of effort

655
00:59:44.48 --> 00:59:50.64
into that. But yeah. But so like the head trauma that was, that was one thing that I really

656
00:59:50.64 --> 00:59:54.40
focused on. And then around that time, I actually started competing in snowboarding.

657
00:59:54.40 --> 01:00:02.16
So you got your bad leg. Bad brain. You got your bad leg, bad brain. Good band, by the way.

658
01:00:02.16 --> 01:00:07.52
And you and you, or society's cool, like, like, we're going to start snowboarding.

659
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:13.36
You're going to get your food from Florida. Yes. Yes. Okay. Where did that come from?

660
01:00:13.36 --> 01:00:18.08
Yeah. No, so there's an organization that came into my hospital room when I was actually

661
01:00:18.08 --> 01:00:23.04
still living at the hospital. I'm in still active duty. And they came in. They just said,

662
01:00:23.04 --> 01:00:27.52
how do you feel about learning a winter sport? And this was in the end of 2013. And I was just

663
01:00:27.52 --> 01:00:33.68
like, you know, anything. Just give me out of the hospital. Well, again, me being me. My doctors

664
01:00:33.68 --> 01:00:37.68
cleared me to Sitsky. But then when I showed up in Breck and I had Colorado, no one asked me

665
01:00:37.68 --> 01:00:41.60
for a medical clearance or anything. And I'm like, well, shit. So nobody looks cool.

666
01:00:41.60 --> 01:00:46.40
I'm going to try that one instead. And I ended up picking it up really quickly. And I loved it.

667
01:00:47.04 --> 01:00:50.72
And you know, it's just one of those things that reminds you of your independence and resiliency.

668
01:00:50.72 --> 01:00:56.32
And, you know, no one can do it for you. So I just kept with it. And what was it like on your bad leg?

669
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:01.28
I mean, it was painful. I mean, and I had a, I have, I had like a little, this weird

670
01:01:01.28 --> 01:01:06.72
caviar, like carbon fiber contraption that basically took all of the weight off of my

671
01:01:06.72 --> 01:01:11.12
lower limb and put it all into my knee at the time. So I mean, I had a little bit of help. But I mean,

672
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:15.84
it was, I mean, it was painful, but it was worth it. I mean, I mean, I wasn't stopping. I mean,

673
01:01:15.84 --> 01:01:23.28
I was still dealing with surgeries. I mean, gosh, I was having a surgery once every age of 12 weeks.

674
01:01:23.28 --> 01:01:27.68
And then having the recovery. And so I mean, I was sneak away from Balboa and go to Big Bear.

675
01:01:27.68 --> 01:01:29.68
And go see you have issues.

676
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:34.56
The deal were most of the surgeries on your leg or were they on everything?

677
01:01:35.20 --> 01:01:40.24
Yeah, yeah, my leg. So between between my leg and my face, that's where the majority of them

678
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:47.60
came from, but 44 now. They told you out of the gate that a bunch of your bones were going to die

679
01:01:47.60 --> 01:01:58.48
in your leg. And they were right. And, and at some point, like, um, you're, you're, are they

680
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:02.80
giving you the protection like, hey, this isn't, this isn't going to last. Yep. I mean,

681
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:07.92
toward the end of my efforts, if you will, um, I mean, they were coming in. They're like,

682
01:02:07.92 --> 01:02:10.80
this is a Christopher Columbus surgery at this point. Like, we're going to go in and we're going to

683
01:02:10.80 --> 01:02:15.20
try and do whether it was bone crafting or neuro decompression or whatever, what it was like,

684
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:19.36
we don't even know we're going to find any more. Um, and finally I came to terms with it. And so

685
01:02:19.36 --> 01:02:25.04
do you know what you can have it? Um, was that before or after you did the walk in England? So my walk

686
01:02:25.04 --> 01:02:32.48
was my son to my leg. Okay. That was so, so you decided, I got this bad leg. I got brain damage.

687
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:36.40
I got everything else going on, but I'm going to go walk a thousand miles. Yes.

688
01:02:36.40 --> 01:02:43.76
In the United Kingdom. How, how that come about? Um, and so actually there was a couple of

689
01:02:45.20 --> 01:02:49.28
older marines that was that were was working for an organization called Bob Wooder Foundation.

690
01:02:49.28 --> 01:02:53.60
And they heard about this event called Walking With The Glunded that, you know, they've done

691
01:02:53.60 --> 01:02:57.84
everything from the North Pole and the South Pole. And it was kind of just like this pilot idea.

692
01:02:57.84 --> 01:03:01.76
Um, and they were just looking for people stupid enough to walk a thousand miles and share enough

693
01:03:01.76 --> 01:03:06.24
one of them smee. Um, but knows that they came up and they were just like, hey, we're thinking

694
01:03:06.24 --> 01:03:10.56
about sponsoring this event. That's going to raise money for American and British soldiers that

695
01:03:10.56 --> 01:03:16.16
are dealing with specifically right injuries had trauma in, you know, invisible injuries of all

696
01:03:16.16 --> 01:03:20.88
sorts. And in the moment I was just like, you know what, the legs come in off anyways. I don't care

697
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:27.84
if I trash it. Um, so let's do this thousand miles and then literally seven days after I got home,

698
01:03:27.84 --> 01:03:32.96
they got my leg off. The thousand miles that you walk, you were with at some point you were with

699
01:03:32.96 --> 01:03:39.60
Prince Harry. Yep. And he's a legit dude. He is a legit dude. I will give him that. I won't give

700
01:03:39.60 --> 01:03:45.44
many other couples. I mean, he, he, well, he's at least legit that he, you know, he, he served. I mean,

701
01:03:45.44 --> 01:03:50.88
he, he fought NAFTA and I stand on the feet. Was he in Iraq? I don't, I don't understand. But yeah,

702
01:03:50.88 --> 01:03:54.32
and there's some pretty cool stuff of him. There's a cool, there's a cool little video

703
01:03:54.32 --> 01:03:59.76
someone's interviewing him and then like the alarm sound to me runs off to go get some. Yep. And so

704
01:03:59.76 --> 01:04:05.28
that was cool. And you had some, some interaction with him? Yeah. Um, so my personal spin on that

705
01:04:05.28 --> 01:04:10.56
thousand miles. Like, of course, I was over there to raise awareness and fundraise. But I made 25

706
01:04:10.56 --> 01:04:15.36
memorial dog tags for Marine's who either never came home or they killed themselves and we got back home.

707
01:04:15.36 --> 01:04:19.68
And I carried each one for 40 miles to the poem and left them all across England's Gotland and

708
01:04:19.68 --> 01:04:24.08
Wales with the intention that a stranger would find them in honor of our fallen. You know, we, we

709
01:04:24.08 --> 01:04:30.40
we should blood together. We deserve to heal or, you know, men wounds together if you want. And he

710
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:37.36
actually helped me lay a few of my dog tags. And then I left the final one with him at Buckingham

711
01:04:37.36 --> 01:04:42.88
Palace and then on what's their better and stay, he carried it to the Senate our for me. So again,

712
01:04:42.88 --> 01:04:47.52
he really has a great dude. His, his hearts in the right place for sure. And that was one of your

713
01:04:47.52 --> 01:04:54.64
friends TJ's at that the final dog tags. So actually that's pretty sad story actually. So there

714
01:04:54.64 --> 01:05:00.000
were two gentlemen that were in the hospital with me. They were blown up 10 days before I got hurt.

715
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.12
So they were with one seven. And of course, you know, me being the 33 unit, we were doing constantly

716
01:05:05.12 --> 01:05:10.88
doing stuff with those guys, you know, insertions and extractions and stuff. And the two gentlemen

717
01:05:10.88 --> 01:05:15.28
that were with one seven, you know, we went through all of our coveries together and TJ was actually

718
01:05:15.28 --> 01:05:22.56
one of, um, was the guy that passed away when they lost their legs. Um, so I didn't, I never knew him.

719
01:05:22.56 --> 01:05:29.28
He was never really a friend. It was more so for them. And this, yeah, has, has wife.

720
01:05:32.80 --> 01:05:40.88
So then you get done with that walking a thousand miles and you come back to San Diego and

721
01:05:40.88 --> 01:05:51.52
pre-planned, you get back in your leg. Okay. This, this, my, my foot is gonna die and let's move forward.

722
01:05:51.52 --> 01:06:02.24
Let's get rid of it. There's a, um, like a video like mini documentary about you. It's done by

723
01:06:02.24 --> 01:06:08.48
my, my calls, my calls, and which is, um, some kind of a magazine. It's a weird fit for me, but yeah.

724
01:06:08.48 --> 01:06:15.20
Anyway, as I watch this video and man, um, there's, there's a video of you and you're walking

725
01:06:15.20 --> 01:06:21.36
on the beach and your barefoot walking on the beach. You're walking on ocean beach by the way.

726
01:06:22.56 --> 01:06:27.20
And there's the pier in the background and you're like saying, yeah, you know, I'm walking on the beach

727
01:06:27.20 --> 01:06:30.88
because I'm not going to be able to do this anymore. I'm not going to be able to feel the sand

728
01:06:30.88 --> 01:06:41.60
on my, on my foot anymore. That has gotta be the, the hardest decision that you've had to make it.

729
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:48.88
I mean, for a person, right? Like you have at least this, like, I mean, I, the same, I mean,

730
01:06:48.88 --> 01:06:55.76
I surf and like I live by the beach. I love the ocean and walking barefoot on the sand is like

731
01:06:55.76 --> 01:07:02.72
totally a thing that is real. Like it's the best thing. And I'm sitting there thinking you'd

732
01:07:02.72 --> 01:07:09.12
been living in OB at the time and crazy that you're sitting there saying, yep, I'm going to,

733
01:07:09.12 --> 01:07:13.36
I'm going to walk on the sand for the last time right now. This is it. This is the last time I

734
01:07:13.36 --> 01:07:18.88
get to feel the sand between my toes. So the last time I get to wait around in this water.

735
01:07:18.88 --> 01:07:28.000
Yep. I was one of those things where it's like, the equality life. I was living a life that

736
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.16
I, you know, I wasn't happy with as far as like living a life of constant recovery,

737
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:36.88
pain, a lot of drugs. I mean, I'd be lying. If I told you, I was like,

738
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.92
sober when I did the thousand mile walk. There was a lot of medication falls in that.

739
01:07:41.92 --> 01:07:46.56
But, you know, like, I just wanted those things. I was ready to close that chapter and just move

740
01:07:46.56 --> 01:07:50.88
forward. You know, there's, there's a lot of things that I wanted to do with my life or that I am doing.

741
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:57.28
And still want to do with my life. And the thing is also important to note is they were going to,

742
01:07:57.84 --> 01:08:05.36
they're going to take your foot, your shin, leave your tib, fib, which I can't fully express this,

743
01:08:05.36 --> 01:08:11.44
but I do know from friends that have had above the knee and below the knee amputation. The

744
01:08:11.44 --> 01:08:18.08
difference between above the knee amputation and below the knee amputation is absolutely massive.

745
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:24.96
The amount of articulation that you have in your knee is just it is incredible compared to

746
01:08:24.96 --> 01:08:31.04
when you lose your knee. Yeah. I mean, I'll never bitch about being an amputee. I'm thankful that

747
01:08:31.04 --> 01:08:42.16
I'm alive. But I would do anything to get my knee back. Well, the initial surgery, they do what they said

748
01:08:42.16 --> 01:08:48.000
they're going to do. They, whatever, made way up your calf or somewhere they leave, they leave enough knee.

749
01:08:48.64 --> 01:08:53.44
And this was right around, was this right around Thanksgiving? Yep. So right around Thanksgiving,

750
01:08:53.92 --> 01:08:59.60
you get this initial surgery. And for you, it's going to be liberating because you're not

751
01:08:59.60 --> 01:09:04.24
going to have to worry about this pain. You can get the feet that will work better than your foot.

752
01:09:04.24 --> 01:09:06.96
That's what it boils down to. I guess that's when I was talking about like all this stuff about

753
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:13.76
the sand and getting all crazy with that. The bottom line is you were thinking, hey, that's great

754
01:09:13.76 --> 01:09:25.52
feeling, but I'm actually able to be better off with the different varieties of prosthetic feet and

755
01:09:25.52 --> 01:09:30.000
ankles and all the stuff that they can give you. I mean, there's many people that have deployed

756
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.04
after they've gotten a below the knee surgery. I don't know how many people have above,

757
01:09:35.04 --> 01:09:39.12
but I'm sure there has been some, but it's a lot different. It's a lot different.

758
01:09:41.20 --> 01:09:50.40
So you get that surgery and it was, I guess it was a bad surgery. There was an infection.

759
01:09:50.40 --> 01:09:55.28
Is what happens? Yeah. I mean, again, one could see for another one, but yeah, that was definitely

760
01:09:55.28 --> 01:10:01.92
some malpractice on that one. But yeah, instead of using staples, they used stitches and I

761
01:10:01.92 --> 01:10:05.68
ever put a looped back on. There was a number of things. I was trying away from the emergency room

762
01:10:05.68 --> 01:10:11.20
three times. I'm going to tell them that it was fine. And then finally, you know, I mean, it was bad.

763
01:10:11.20 --> 01:10:19.20
I mean, it was really, really bad. And they finally, there was actually a doctor from scripts.

764
01:10:19.20 --> 01:10:23.92
That was like filling in for one of the doctors out in the ER at Pau Boa. And she saw my leg and

765
01:10:23.92 --> 01:10:27.44
she was like, oh, hell, no. Like, take every, but like, don't even put her in x-rays. Like,

766
01:10:27.44 --> 01:10:31.36
take everybody out of the OR. Like, I'm going in with her. And then it up, cutting out

767
01:10:32.40 --> 01:10:37.60
the room half of my knee. They left my patella. And then they went back in and they said that that

768
01:10:37.60 --> 01:10:41.76
was enough. And they took her on patella and made it in a bubb-n-e. So they

769
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:56.24
gave a team cut my, my favorite. There's a note from you. December 20th, 2015, that I am awake

770
01:10:56.24 --> 01:11:01.20
and out of surgery for today. I lost a lot of muscle due to infection. Unless I have a Christmas

771
01:11:01.20 --> 01:11:06.72
miracle, they'll be taking my knee tomorrow. These are the times it's easy to give up.

772
01:11:06.72 --> 01:11:17.04
December 23rd, 2015 update. The infection almost killed me. It was eating the muscles in my leg.

773
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:26.56
They saved my life plain and simple. I am an above the knee amputee, but I am healthier now. Still fighting

774
01:11:26.56 --> 01:11:32.24
the infection in more surgery. 10 a.m. which could make me a hip dysardic.

775
01:11:32.24 --> 01:11:40.000
Which could be worse, but nothing I can't beat. They're, they are trying their best.

776
01:11:41.60 --> 01:11:46.16
Said they've never seen anything so bad as to what was going on in my leg. I know I can beat this.

777
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:48.80
I just hope they don't have to go too high on this limb.

778
01:11:50.48 --> 01:11:53.76
Menelian emotionally, this is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with.

779
01:11:55.60 --> 01:11:57.28
I am terrified.

780
01:11:57.28 --> 01:12:07.44
When they came in and said that they might take my hip, I didn't want them to wake me back up.

781
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:14.24
They do not bring me out of that surgery room. Keep me asleep. You take, I mean,

782
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.64
God love and could also anybody that's sitting in a bucket and has to live their life as a

783
01:12:20.64 --> 01:12:31.44
hip dysardic. That news was awful. I didn't think I was going to have the courage to keep going.

784
01:12:33.28 --> 01:12:34.88
I didn't want to keep going at that point.

785
01:12:37.44 --> 01:12:40.88
In the beginning of that, when you were reading and I was sitting, God, I was full shit.

786
01:12:40.88 --> 01:12:42.56
I'm just telling everybody that it's going to be okay.

787
01:12:42.56 --> 01:12:48.96
I'm glad that I at least finished that with I'm terrified because it's honest. It's true.

788
01:12:51.84 --> 01:13:02.08
December 24th, 2015. This is the next day. Christmas Eve. I am alive. I'm happy.

789
01:13:02.08 --> 01:13:05.60
I don't know anything about good news about my leg and it looks great. Being in above the

790
01:13:05.60 --> 01:13:12.40
knee amputee will be challenging at first and all I can say is bring it on. On another note, I am

791
01:13:12.40 --> 01:13:19.12
very sick and will be for quite some time. They found three bacterial infections, including Mersea.

792
01:13:20.40 --> 01:13:25.76
They also found blood caught in my arm. They put a pick line in. This is a light threatening

793
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:34.64
matter, so I'll need to lay low for a while. Please keep praying. I got this. We got this.

794
01:13:43.04 --> 01:13:43.92
Craziness.

795
01:13:47.52 --> 01:13:52.56
Yep. Your parents were living here at this time? No. So you were who you with?

796
01:13:52.56 --> 01:14:02.08
I was living with my boyfriend at the time. My mom was living with us. She was around.

797
01:14:02.08 --> 01:14:10.40
It was the craziest thing. We all knew my life was just rotting. That's just what it was doing.

798
01:14:11.76 --> 01:14:16.96
My mom would go with me. You are. We would get turned away. My boyfriend at the time had gone

799
01:14:16.96 --> 01:14:22.000
back to Florida to drive with my little sister out because it was coming up on the holidays and stuff.

800
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:30.24
When he was in Florida with her, you need to get your family here because we don't know if

801
01:14:30.24 --> 01:14:35.36
you're going to pull through this one. My dad's flying in from being on the pipeline. They're

802
01:14:35.36 --> 01:14:48.72
rushing driving across the country through the night to get back. It was bad.

803
01:14:50.08 --> 01:14:59.68
You eventually recovered from this. Good Lord. How long has it take to fight off these triple

804
01:14:59.68 --> 01:15:06.48
bacteria infections and whatnot? I ended up getting out of the hospital. It would have been very late

805
01:15:06.48 --> 01:15:12.96
January, early February. I was there for at least another month, five six weeks. During that five

806
01:15:12.96 --> 01:15:17.92
six weeks, is that when you started doing rehab to get fitted for a prosthetic, did that happen that

807
01:15:17.92 --> 01:15:25.20
fast? So they actually sort of fitting me when my staples came out. So yeah, so would have been

808
01:15:25.20 --> 01:15:29.76
probably the week before I got out of the hospital. Then I hit the ground run with that.

809
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:34.72
Which is no big surprise at this point. I don't want my leg and I want to get the freak out of here.

810
01:15:34.72 --> 01:15:40.88
So. Then what happens then? So now what was that rehab process? You're trying to learn to walk

811
01:15:40.88 --> 01:15:45.84
again and all this stuff? Yeah. So your supposed to go to physical therapy and go to gate training

812
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:52.48
and sit through six weeks, birth of training on this like, learning how to walk. They let

813
01:15:52.48 --> 01:15:58.64
me go after two weeks. So I took my leg on after two weeks and just like, I mean, this is,

814
01:15:58.64 --> 01:16:03.52
this is it. And I'm going to actually have these videos of my mom watching me for walk for the first

815
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:08.56
time and of course it was very emotional and whatnot, but it was like it didn't skip a beat.

816
01:16:08.56 --> 01:16:13.20
He gave me two weeks and I was going to figure it out. And then where'd you go when you got

817
01:16:13.20 --> 01:16:16.96
release from the hospital? Did you stay in San Diego? Yeah, I stayed in San Diego for quite some time.

818
01:16:16.96 --> 01:16:23.36
Then I ended up going up to Temecula for a little while and then bouncing back and forth,

819
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:28.000
got back on my snowboard and so I was spending the winters in Colorado and going back

820
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:35.76
your in California. What is it like snowboarding? No. Oh, it is weird. No, it's, I don't know.

821
01:16:35.76 --> 01:16:39.92
I mean, I don't know any, like, I can't remember what it's like anymore to like snowboard with

822
01:16:39.92 --> 01:16:46.72
two legs or a busted up leg. I don't know. I mean, it's again, like I just got back on a board

823
01:16:46.72 --> 01:16:54.40
and just rode. I mean, of course I wiped down. I hurt quite a bit. But yeah, I've got some, you know,

824
01:16:54.40 --> 01:17:01.76
again, just didn't skip a beat. And at this point, like, okay, so that cosmopolitan video was made

825
01:17:02.72 --> 01:17:08.80
around this time, right? So you're starting to get some kind of notoriety. Is that the right word?

826
01:17:08.80 --> 01:17:13.76
Wait, is notoriety bad? No, I don't know. I don't know. You seem like the type of person that

827
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:18.16
wouldn't want to be called famous, but you're starting to get some some recognition. Right?

828
01:17:18.16 --> 01:17:24.80
People are starting to sort of hear what you've gone through and start to be interested in the story.

829
01:17:24.80 --> 01:17:30.32
Right? So this is all happening to at this time, which is weird. It was very, very weird.

830
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:33.60
I mean, I'm not like, when I think of any of the things that I've done at this point,

831
01:17:33.60 --> 01:17:36.72
it's like, you don't want to be celebrated. You don't want the attention for doing what you

832
01:17:36.72 --> 01:17:40.16
want to do and living your life. How you want to live it. Like, I wasn't doing anything

833
01:17:40.16 --> 01:17:43.84
miraculous. I'm just like, I want to live. I want to move forward with my life. I want to be here

834
01:17:43.84 --> 01:17:49.44
for my family. And then even now, it's, I just like helping people. I'm like, you know, I mean,

835
01:17:49.44 --> 01:17:57.20
so yeah. So you get the cosmopolitan thing. You're, you go and you, you go and do a job as a

836
01:17:57.20 --> 01:18:03.20
stunt woman in a movie. What's that all about? I just, Philan Voids, you know,

837
01:18:04.08 --> 01:18:07.92
adrenaline seeking, I guess, trying to fill that. What is Jesus' stunt woman?

838
01:18:07.92 --> 01:18:13.12
Um, so everything from Gaurc crashes to explosions, to pyro. Did anyone notify you that

839
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:20.72
this makes you are your head? There was a couple times. But yeah, no, you're like, I'll

840
01:18:20.72 --> 01:18:26.72
crank up the speech therapy and just do more stunts. That's it. Yeah. All my guns on.

841
01:18:26.72 --> 01:18:32.16
Heck, what did you, uh, what you were in a movie with Mark Wahlberg? Is that right? Yeah.

842
01:18:32.16 --> 01:18:36.24
That's the biggest one. It's a Patriots day. And what do you do in that movie? Get the one up.

843
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:41.12
You're like, I got experience at this. Yeah. Check this out. Yeah. Like, get blown up. Get

844
01:18:41.12 --> 01:18:45.36
carried around on stretchers. Luzilim, followed by wheelchair at one's at one point.

845
01:18:46.08 --> 01:18:52.48
Bunch of different scenes. Yeah. Um, okay. So, so you got that going on. You got the, the

846
01:18:52.48 --> 01:18:59.44
people magazine body image hero, which is what, what does that mean? Well, when I was

847
01:19:00.64 --> 01:19:04.000
in this whole process, I mean, even from the get go with the face, like the interest in my face,

848
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.56
um, you know, I didn't, and the doctor saw me all the stuff about my leg. I didn't really

849
01:19:09.36 --> 01:19:13.76
care if I was going to be able to get up and run again, or any of that, like, as a young woman, you know,

850
01:19:13.76 --> 01:19:17.52
all I cared about was who's looking at me differently? Can I wear heels? Can I wear a dress? Is anybody

851
01:19:17.52 --> 01:19:22.64
going to find me attractive enough to have a family one day? Like, really worried about the self-esteem

852
01:19:22.64 --> 01:19:28.32
stuff. Um, and so like, moving forward, I just decided that I was going to own my differences,

853
01:19:28.32 --> 01:19:32.08
that I was going to like be proud of the scars that I wore because they told my stories. They think,

854
01:19:32.08 --> 01:19:37.60
I mean, in my opinion, they make me look pretty tough too, but um, but no, like, I wanted to show

855
01:19:37.60 --> 01:19:44.56
people that it was okay to me. It's street cred. Exactly. Yeah. But that's like, I just wanted

856
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:48.72
to show people that it was okay, you know, like, you don't have to be the cookie cutter, you know,

857
01:19:48.72 --> 01:19:53.44
definition of what beautiful is. And I don't want to say the cheesy, like, you know, beauty comes

858
01:19:53.44 --> 01:19:57.52
from within, but I like, I wanted to show people that it was, I mean, it was beautiful to be strong.

859
01:19:57.52 --> 01:20:02.88
It was, you know, it was beautiful to have drive and have well and to, to not fail. I mean,

860
01:20:02.88 --> 01:20:09.52
to give it a all. And so that that's, that's what the people magazine, things of what they

861
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:15.36
interview you and take a bunch of pictures of you and all that. And now, again, I'm just, I'm just

862
01:20:15.36 --> 01:20:21.20
kind of have to trace the fact that people are starting to follow you and and recognize that you're

863
01:20:21.20 --> 01:20:27.44
a, um, that you have a very interesting story and inspiring story. Yeah. As these things are happening,

864
01:20:27.44 --> 01:20:33.20
because the reason I kind of have to say that is because then you like do other things at the same

865
01:20:33.20 --> 01:20:38.24
time, like getting stunt women and getting crashed and blown up and stuff like that. And at some

866
01:20:38.24 --> 01:20:42.48
point, you got your master's degree in business administration, right? And this is still just

867
01:20:42.48 --> 01:20:50.88
approved to people that you can still mentally go. Yes. And yes. But on the other, I think the other

868
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:56.48
side is that to like, even right now when I do eventually finish this doctor, like I'm terrified

869
01:20:56.48 --> 01:21:00.64
of what I'm going to do with that time. I'm like, oh my god, I love structure. I'm so, you

870
01:21:00.64 --> 01:21:04.88
mumbled filling the void. The other is like a couple minutes ago, you're like, I'm filling the

871
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:10.08
void. So what you're saying is you have to be busy. You have to have something to focus on,

872
01:21:10.08 --> 01:21:15.12
something to do exactly. Okay. That starts to explain some things. Yes. Because at some point,

873
01:21:16.08 --> 01:21:21.36
you decided that you were going to put another thing on your list of things to get done,

874
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:29.76
and it's climb the seven summits. Right. So the highest peak on either the seven continents.

875
01:21:30.96 --> 01:21:35.36
It was one of the things that hasn't been done by a female above the knee amputee, I can't speak

876
01:21:35.36 --> 01:21:41.52
for the men. But yeah, I decided that I needed something. You know, I lost the 2016 snowboarding season

877
01:21:41.52 --> 01:21:47.68
due to the last revision surgery to my amputated side. And so I was like, well, I can't do any

878
01:21:47.68 --> 01:21:54.08
high impact sport. So what else can I do in the mountains? And you might want to check with

879
01:21:54.08 --> 01:22:00.56
you, you're like, this is the thing mountain here, not a high impact sport. Okay. We went up

880
01:22:00.56 --> 01:22:07.68
the set up a little coaching situation here. Because I'm not sure. So check it out. So the idea,

881
01:22:07.68 --> 01:22:11.60
you get the idea, you must just say, okay, what kind of do that's super, super hard? Yeah.

882
01:22:12.64 --> 01:22:16.48
You start with Kilimanjaro, is that the first one? Yep. And how that go?

883
01:22:17.44 --> 01:22:21.76
It was amazing. Actually, it was insane. Because we were up and down in four and a half days,

884
01:22:21.76 --> 01:22:28.000
which Kilimanjaro stands 19,000, 241 feet. So for me to make my way up and make it my way back down,

885
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.52
that quickly was without a control. But it was one of those things where it was, I mean,

886
01:22:35.20 --> 01:22:40.64
in a sick way, like, just like I was addicted to school, I sort of get addicted to that suffering,

887
01:22:40.64 --> 01:22:44.88
because like you suffer in your miserable, for days on end. But then once you make it to your goal,

888
01:22:44.88 --> 01:22:50.24
it's that much sweeter. And so, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like a weird hunger from more

889
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:55.92
that I wasn't really like finding any worlds. And then, I mean, I mean, we ended up raising like

890
01:22:55.92 --> 01:23:02.000
$150,000 for clean water for the East Tanzanians with that climb. So now it's like, I have the personal

891
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
side of things. And then I have this other purpose that I was already, you know, felt like I was missing

892
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.88
by not having any Marine Corps. And then from there, that's when I everything took. So which one came

893
01:23:10.88 --> 01:23:17.84
next? Carstens. And carstens. I was looking at that one. This is in Indonesia. How tall is it?

894
01:23:18.64 --> 01:23:25.20
Just over 16,000 feet. And it looked to me like the getting there was half the battle. Yeah. So,

895
01:23:25.20 --> 01:23:29.92
honestly, I mean, carstens is an interesting mountain, because it's notorious for being the most

896
01:23:29.92 --> 01:23:36.32
hostile and technical invertant, really versatile. But I mean, it's a 72 mile trek into the base of

897
01:23:36.32 --> 01:23:42.64
this rock face. So yeah, it's just, I mean, it's honestly low impact. Right back, it's a low impact scenario.

898
01:23:42.64 --> 01:23:49.04
It's 72 miles. Yeah. But I mean, even just getting out there. And I mean, the people that you

899
01:23:49.04 --> 01:23:53.84
encounter, the Donnie and the Money tribes, like, I mean, that was just an experience in itself.

900
01:23:53.84 --> 01:23:59.12
I mean, the local indigenous tribes came through and like ransacked and destroyed all over

901
01:23:59.12 --> 01:24:04.64
camps and stole our passports while we're like, up, 15,000 feet watching them. Did they teach you

902
01:24:04.64 --> 01:24:09.68
them? Yeah, that's very awesome stuff. You got to leave me a little couple of people back.

903
01:24:09.68 --> 01:24:16.48
That's a curdy on that stuff. Yeah. So it's 72 mile hike in. Yeah. Now, some of my friends that are

904
01:24:16.48 --> 01:24:24.32
amputees, it's not like your your prosthetic just is this clean, easy fit and it's all good to go.

905
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:31.84
That thing, that thing gets all kinds of issues. I was thinking about, I sweat a lot. If I was

906
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:36.56
wearing the prosthetic, you have, they would have to put drain holes on the bottom of it. Do they have

907
01:24:36.56 --> 01:24:41.20
drain holes? Nope. But they see them. I would feel that thing up with sweat.

908
01:24:41.20 --> 01:24:45.92
But we'll go back. I'll send you a link later to my Everest, like mini documentary and I'm

909
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:50.000
going to tank top when everybody else is in like these big, poppy summits. It's I run so hot and

910
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.04
I'll let I miss you my leg and so I fill your paint on that. So you're doing these lawn. You do

911
01:24:55.04 --> 01:25:02.16
that and you make it to the to the top of car stands, right? Yeah. You launch at some point,

912
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:07.44
I guess you wanted to put your business administrative degree to work. So you launched a T-shirt

913
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:15.92
company called Headcase. What inspired that? It will. So I'm an avid hunter. I believe in

914
01:25:16.80 --> 01:25:21.60
the things that I consume. They need to die at my hands. I don't like eating things that are

915
01:25:21.60 --> 01:25:26.000
bred to die. So it was really involved in the outward industry as far as mountain hunting and

916
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.12
the likes of that nature. And if you walked into my house now, it is full of taxidermy specifically

917
01:25:31.12 --> 01:25:37.60
schools. And so there you have it. So a lot of it was joining forces with my buddy Nevada who

918
01:25:37.60 --> 01:25:42.88
carved schools for living now and using his artwork and in schools, you know, the head case and

919
01:25:42.88 --> 01:25:48.88
the outdoors. When you, at what point did you, did you grow up as a hunter? I mean, we did little

920
01:25:48.88 --> 01:25:53.12
stuff, you know, white tail and hogs and stuff like that growing up, but none of the stuff that I'm

921
01:25:53.12 --> 01:26:00.16
doing now. And when did that start? In this whole freaking crazy scenario you've got on folding.

922
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:05.04
You know, I, so we were talking about like loss and gain earlier. And again, my biggest

923
01:26:05.04 --> 01:26:09.28
perspective, like biggest gain has been my perspective on life. And so I started to appreciate,

924
01:26:09.28 --> 01:26:14.48
started to appreciate just the cycle. And so that's when I really started to look into,

925
01:26:15.12 --> 01:26:18.96
okay, well, what's going on in the outdoors? What am I actually putting into my body, A,

926
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:24.000
and then also just, you know, conservation efforts. And, and then, yeah, I'm being able to

927
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:31.12
provide for my family, like in the most natural way possible. And yeah, I mean, hunting is not about death.

928
01:26:31.12 --> 01:26:34.40
It's about living. What, what, you, when did you go on your first hunt?

929
01:26:35.52 --> 01:26:40.24
Oh, man, growing up? No, no, like you're, you're more recent hunting career.

930
01:26:41.44 --> 01:26:46.32
Probably, 2013. Okay. So you got right right into it. 2014 somewhere there, yeah.

931
01:26:46.32 --> 01:26:53.04
And by the way, anyone doesn't know hunting is not easy. And you, I mean, involves,

932
01:26:54.08 --> 01:27:00.56
it involves, that's why when you're talking about 72 mile hike in, I mean, hunting takes a lot of,

933
01:27:00.56 --> 01:27:07.36
look, I just went on a hunt. And I think we were averaging, like, I think we average, like 10, 10,

934
01:27:07.36 --> 01:27:12.72
or 12 miles a day. It's like, eight to 12 miles a day. You know, you're putting out up and down,

935
01:27:12.72 --> 01:27:17.68
hills and it's, it's hard work. And I'm doing, I'm out there doing it with two legs,

936
01:27:17.68 --> 01:27:25.20
by the way. So, okay. So, you start your t-shirt thing. And then you go for your first little,

937
01:27:25.20 --> 01:27:31.28
kind of, uh, little, what would you call it? Little recon, a little recon of Everest,

938
01:27:31.28 --> 01:27:37.20
to base camp. Yes. That was just, let's get a look at this thing. Let's see what's up.

939
01:27:37.20 --> 01:27:43.84
Yeah, I mean, how inspiring was that? We like, oh, exactly like that actually.

940
01:27:43.84 --> 01:27:47.92
Right. I could imagine that would be, if you have that in your mind and you get there in your

941
01:27:47.92 --> 01:27:53.36
thaw bottom, you're like, let's do this. Yes. And I was losing it. I mean, obviously, just very

942
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:58.24
emotional together. But, you know, there's several, like, there's Hoot and Holleron and several

943
01:27:58.24 --> 01:28:03.92
of bombs and tears and, you know, everything. But no, I mean, the moment, like, three days into the

944
01:28:03.92 --> 01:28:08.08
actual, like, base camp track, I saw Everest for the first time and I just knew, like,

945
01:28:08.88 --> 01:28:14.000
that's it. I'm going to do it. And so, so that was just getting, getting a feel for it,

946
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.08
yeah. Getting to know people, getting to kind of see how the system would run, who'd you go,

947
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:22.48
like, what brought, how'd you get on that trip? Um, so actually, you're not like walking down

948
01:28:22.48 --> 01:28:27.52
to the, the travel, what are those people called? Travel agent. Travel agent. Travel agent.

949
01:28:27.52 --> 01:28:33.36
Yeah, book me to base camp one way. So, actually, this check by the name of a haily web that I met

950
01:28:33.36 --> 01:28:38.64
on my thousand mile walk. Um, she's, she was the local mountain guide over there and she hit me

951
01:28:38.64 --> 01:28:43.84
up out of nowhere. I'm just like, hey, I'm going to, you know, guide a base camp track to Everest.

952
01:28:43.84 --> 01:28:47.28
You want to come and I'm like, well, actually, yes. Because I needed to decide if I'm going to

953
01:28:47.28 --> 01:28:52.08
climb from the north side or the south side, you know, down the road. And so, yeah, I mean,

954
01:28:52.08 --> 01:28:56.16
I went down there in absolutely fell in love with Nepal and the people and just their way of life

955
01:28:56.16 --> 01:29:02.24
in their culture. Okay. So, you get done with that. At some point, you open a hair salon? Yes.

956
01:29:02.24 --> 01:29:07.28
I hear an ocean side for a little ways up in a ocean side. Right on, is that so old there?

957
01:29:07.28 --> 01:29:11.60
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's during really well. Um, well, so, so a little backstory to all of these

958
01:29:11.60 --> 01:29:14.96
random little things that I'm doing. Yeah, because you are doing some random stuff at this point.

959
01:29:14.96 --> 01:29:19.20
And I want me to look, it can be a really fresh man here. No, so when I woke up in the hospital in

960
01:29:19.20 --> 01:29:24.000
2015, I looked around the room and told myself that whoever was in that hospital room with me,

961
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.20
that they would never work for anybody else over again. That, like, if they were willing to

962
01:29:27.20 --> 01:29:32.48
sacrifice their time, you know, their personal lives remain to make sure that I was okay. That,

963
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:36.32
you know, I was going to help them live out their dreams, they help keep me alive. So,

964
01:29:37.12 --> 01:29:42.16
my best friend Christine is actually my business partner in that. So, she's the head

965
01:29:42.16 --> 01:29:48.56
haunched down there. I'm just the CFO slash investor. So, if we're, if we're an O side, that's it.

966
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:54.24
And we need a haircut. Where do we go? Chapter one here and body lab. Chapter one here and body.

967
01:29:54.24 --> 01:29:58.96
Do you give high entice there? No, they won't do it. Dang it. What about all the

968
01:29:58.96 --> 01:30:02.72
you see earlier you said like, was it three five you said I hope three five is listening to this?

969
01:30:02.72 --> 01:30:08.24
Two five. You said I hope two five and in my mind two five is listening to this. Once there are so many

970
01:30:08.24 --> 01:30:15.20
Marines listening to this right now that if you don't get a pair of clippers at at at the place up an

971
01:30:15.20 --> 01:30:23.76
O side, you know, let's make it happen. Okay, so you get that going on and then February,

972
01:30:23.76 --> 01:30:28.32
you start you go back to climbing. So, November was you went to Everspace Camp Trek.

973
01:30:29.04 --> 01:30:35.68
You do the hair salon thing February, you go to, I could go to a go to a taxi. You go to

974
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:44.24
Ecuador for a colto taxi. And this is a summit attempt. Right. But you didn't make it.

975
01:30:44.24 --> 01:30:51.12
Nope. Well, yeah, turn around at like 18,500. And what is it? How much further did you have to go?

976
01:30:51.12 --> 01:31:01.12
Oh, another 1500 vertical? What was it? Just altitude and moving slow. My climbing partner had a headache.

977
01:31:02.96 --> 01:31:07.44
We were about to hit this like really long traverse section and like with my prosthetic if the

978
01:31:07.44 --> 01:31:13.44
high side is on my left side or my prosthetic side, I cannot move well. So with her being light,

979
01:31:13.44 --> 01:31:17.28
had I had having a headache and me already being a little unsighty in the feed just was,

980
01:31:17.28 --> 01:31:21.76
didn't make sense. Yeah, to make a smart call. Yep. And you kind of talked about that in some of

981
01:31:21.76 --> 01:31:28.72
your blogs just about like making a good decision, which the mountains are littered with bodies of people

982
01:31:28.72 --> 01:31:34.56
that get summit fever and they're going to go for it and they don't make it. Exactly. And that's

983
01:31:34.56 --> 01:31:37.52
one of those things where it's like if someone's climbing with me and something happened,

984
01:31:37.52 --> 01:31:42.40
like I wouldn't be able to live with myself. So yeah, I mean the mountains are not going anywhere.

985
01:31:42.40 --> 01:31:47.12
And if that one does, it's going to be another one. So. So you get done with that one.

986
01:31:47.12 --> 01:31:53.76
Some lessons learned and then you go to, you then you go to try Denali. Yeah, Denali is a mean,

987
01:31:53.76 --> 01:32:01.20
main mountain. Yeah, so go out to Denali and spend literally a month, the whole entire month of

988
01:32:01.20 --> 01:32:09.12
June 2018 on Denali and we made it up to 14,000 feet, we're pinned for 17 days. Now going up,

989
01:32:09.12 --> 01:32:13.28
now going down. We were scalping food and fuel from people as they were like making their way

990
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:17.52
down. We were trying to be stubborn and right out this terrible terrible. I mean, what would really be

991
01:32:17.52 --> 01:32:23.20
a 717 days and like you would sleep for 90 minutes and you get out of your tent for 90 minutes

992
01:32:23.20 --> 01:32:30.32
and dig your tent out. I think I could sleep. That's like you can do for 17 days. 17 days.

993
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:36.96
Do you, do you, do you, does your body a try so bad in 17 days? Like I think about like,

994
01:32:37.76 --> 01:32:42.88
I work out all the time, but occasionally, okay, so here's an example. We just had an event called

995
01:32:42.88 --> 01:32:48.48
the mustard in Denvercala, Rodo. If I would have known you, you would have been there for

996
01:32:48.48 --> 01:32:52.64
another one of what have been awesome. So like during that week, it's kind of hard to do my normal

997
01:32:52.64 --> 01:32:57.60
workout routine. It's a little bit lighter than normal. And then from that, I came home for one day.

998
01:32:57.60 --> 01:33:02.24
I got one workout and then I went hunting in Utah and I didn't work out there other than

999
01:33:02.24 --> 01:33:06.72
humping up and out. But I can imagine if all you're doing is sitting in a tent and then getting

1000
01:33:06.72 --> 01:33:10.88
out every 90 minutes and digging out. And then if you think at the end of that, you're going to have

1001
01:33:10.88 --> 01:33:18.000
to go and walk up that freaking mountain. Yeah, that seems like a, yeah, I mean, I mean, yeah,

1002
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.48
I mean, your body just attributes anyways. But of course, being an altitude, like you're just

1003
01:33:22.48 --> 01:33:27.28
withering away as it is. And up there, limited food, limited supplies. Like you're not going to

1004
01:33:27.28 --> 01:33:31.44
sit there and just be shoveling all sorts of stuff in your face. So, but it was hard. And then out there

1005
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:36.80
in Denon, like you can't just go for a hike or any of that. Like there are so many crevasses

1006
01:33:36.80 --> 01:33:40.08
that everything that you have to do, you have to have your technical gear be on a rope.

1007
01:33:40.08 --> 01:33:44.88
So, I mean, you were literally confined to your tent and to very, very small, like little

1008
01:33:44.88 --> 01:33:50.72
living space. What was the avalanche threat? Well, luckily, we were far enough for many slabs.

1009
01:33:50.72 --> 01:33:53.20
I mean, we're really just kind of hanging out there. At that point, you're just worried about

1010
01:33:53.20 --> 01:33:57.92
being very alive because you slept too long. Okay, knowing, I don't know you well, but at least

1011
01:33:57.92 --> 01:34:01.68
sitting through this podcast and realizing that you need to be doing something at all times.

1012
01:34:01.68 --> 01:34:07.36
What, what the hell was your mindset after day 12? I was terrible. I honestly,

1013
01:34:07.36 --> 01:34:12.24
any claim, like the hardest part of my tent time, like I could not sit still. And so yeah,

1014
01:34:12.24 --> 01:34:17.60
I mean, you bring anything with you, bring a book to you, whatever. Yes, and no. So, on Denon,

1015
01:34:17.60 --> 01:34:21.60
it's illegal to have any sharpness or any help because it's part of the National Park Service. So,

1016
01:34:21.60 --> 01:34:26.24
I mean, you have to drag a 50 pounds lead and carry a 50 pounds lead. So, you're interested.

1017
01:34:26.24 --> 01:34:32.08
I hear that. So, yeah, I mean, we both neglect at one point. That.

1018
01:34:33.92 --> 01:34:36.40
Okay, so then you get eventually you get weathered off that climb.

1019
01:34:36.40 --> 01:34:40.80
Yeah, well, so we had a very short weather window. We ended up making it up to again,

1020
01:34:40.80 --> 01:34:48.24
18,200, 300. Same climbing partner that I was actually on Kodapaxi with. I was moving a little

1021
01:34:48.24 --> 01:34:53.76
bit slow. This section called the Autobahn. And, you know, the weather was rolling on quick.

1022
01:34:53.76 --> 01:34:58.08
She wasn't feeling too hot. Just, you know, just wasn't going to happen then. So, I made the

1023
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:04.72
cold to turn around and come down. So, you, so now the next thing that you're looking at is the

1024
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:09.28
opportunity to do Everest again. That's where you were up. So, you come down from Denali and now

1025
01:35:09.28 --> 01:35:14.88
it's now it's Everest, go time. Yes, and now so I did Elbrist, the highest point in Europe over in

1026
01:35:14.88 --> 01:35:20.32
Russia. Okay. So, I did Denali in June 2018 or it's time to get in June 2018. Elbrist,

1027
01:35:20.32 --> 01:35:26.32
the highest point in Europe in September 2018. And then I went down to South America and Argentina.

1028
01:35:26.88 --> 01:35:32.24
January 2019, crushed that one. So, then I decided I was ready for Everest.

1029
01:35:32.24 --> 01:35:38.000
Okay. Now, you decide you're ready for Everest. Is there still, is that because you've been

1030
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.96
hiking in the mountains so much you've been doing so much that you're feeling like you're conditioning

1031
01:35:40.96 --> 01:35:47.28
is good or is it like, is it like when you fight in MMA or you run a triathlon where when you get

1032
01:35:47.28 --> 01:35:52.96
done you okay at a recover a little bit? Yeah, I mean, it is, but like for me especially, I mean,

1033
01:35:52.96 --> 01:35:57.04
for any mountaineer, it's like building box. Like, each of these mountains, A Humbles you, but then

1034
01:35:57.04 --> 01:36:02.72
teaches you something different. So, whether you know, you know, Kilimanjaro for example was my

1035
01:36:02.72 --> 01:36:06.000
first full exposure to endurance. So to speak, you know, especially the altitude,

1036
01:36:06.56 --> 01:36:10.24
Cursed ends with super technical. So that's a totally different skill set. Denali, winter,

1037
01:36:10.24 --> 01:36:15.68
camping, glacier, travel, Elbrist, patients for myself and people, hacking, Kaguah,

1038
01:36:15.68 --> 01:36:18.48
it's the highest mountain outside of the hill. Kind of rushed over that one pretty quick.

1039
01:36:18.48 --> 01:36:22.48
Yeah, what Elbrist? No, patients for people. People? Oh, yeah.

1040
01:36:22.48 --> 01:36:29.76
Yeah, that's yeah. Working on this home. And then yeah, Ack and Kaguah is known as the mountain of

1041
01:36:29.76 --> 01:36:35.36
death. It's the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas and down in Argentina and that one really taught

1042
01:36:35.36 --> 01:36:41.12
me just how my body is going to react to that kind of altitude to big mountains. Then how did it react?

1043
01:36:41.12 --> 01:36:49.20
Totally fine. It's weird. So I run super hot, because of losing the leg. And then I don't

1044
01:36:49.20 --> 01:36:53.76
right now, knock on wood. I don't really suffer from any like altitude side effects. I can

1045
01:36:53.76 --> 01:36:58.32
don't have the headaches. I don't have a hard time breathing. So once I confirmed that, I was like,

1046
01:36:58.32 --> 01:37:04.08
all right, let's go. The only issue that really ever kind of comes up is my residual limb

1047
01:37:04.08 --> 01:37:08.72
swells inside of the carbon fiber socket. So that can be kind of risky.

1048
01:37:10.72 --> 01:37:15.20
And that can be risky because you won't be able to get it off. Got cut off circulation.

1049
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:19.04
Okay, so you cut off circulation. And then you then you have a real problem. Yes.

1050
01:37:21.04 --> 01:37:26.56
Okay, well, did you have to do any more prep? So when you when you're not looking at Everest,

1051
01:37:27.20 --> 01:37:31.12
you're doing your feeling like you're in pretty good shape for it physically.

1052
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:36.40
And then it's okay, let's get all my gear together, which now you know pretty well,

1053
01:37:36.40 --> 01:37:40.80
because you've done these other climbs. Your feeling like your gear list is pretty straightforward.

1054
01:37:40.80 --> 01:37:48.72
Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about Everest. So you get to, you get there, you get to

1055
01:37:48.72 --> 01:37:54.80
base camp. What's that like? How freaking pumped are you at this point? I was jazzed. I mean,

1056
01:37:54.80 --> 01:37:59.20
more than it was crazy too, just because I mean, obviously, you know, I've been out there already.

1057
01:37:59.20 --> 01:38:04.08
So I mean, all of these memories are coming back up. And I mean, you're just in total all

1058
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:09.44
walking out in the Himalayas. Like, you do not matter. Nothing about you matters out there. So

1059
01:38:09.44 --> 01:38:14.80
like, I mean, it's a it's a world when you when you're first cruising in to Everest Base Camp

1060
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:19.68
and just into the Kumbu region of Nepal. But like making it into base camp, it was interesting

1061
01:38:19.68 --> 01:38:24.56
because there were so many people like waiting for me there. Like so many people either they saw me

1062
01:38:24.56 --> 01:38:28.96
on the base camp track. They've been watching my career, whatever. Like they were just so stoked

1063
01:38:28.96 --> 01:38:32.24
to have me there. And that just meant so much to me because it was like, you know what,

1064
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:37.12
I knew this was big. In my mind, this is big, but not as big as like whatever,

1065
01:38:37.12 --> 01:38:41.44
but yeah, things that as I guess, and like it made me realize that I was impacting a lot more

1066
01:38:41.44 --> 01:38:46.48
people. And then of course there was like the nasaer and from, you know, from time to time that

1067
01:38:46.48 --> 01:38:50.16
tell me, oh, you're not going to make it above camp 2 as in above the NPPTA. And of course,

1068
01:38:50.16 --> 01:38:56.16
that just feels my fire. But no, I mean, base camp special place, just because it's like this

1069
01:38:56.16 --> 01:39:01.04
huge, obviously, tent city, but there are people from all over the world with the same

1070
01:39:01.04 --> 01:39:07.12
coin goal of getting to the highest point in the world. How long how many days were you at base camp

1071
01:39:07.12 --> 01:39:15.36
for? Um, geez. So what have been in two or three weeks? So it's like two or three weeks at base camp.

1072
01:39:15.36 --> 01:39:19.20
And then, do you do those little excursions where you go up for a little bit and come back down?

1073
01:39:19.20 --> 01:39:26.48
Yeah. Yeah. Well, so there's the kumbu ice fall, which is realistically probably the most

1074
01:39:26.48 --> 01:39:31.60
dangerous part of Everest, at least as far as climbing goes. And it's just because the ground's

1075
01:39:31.60 --> 01:39:37.04
constantly shifting. Obviously, I mean, the name tells you all like ice falls, there's avalanches.

1076
01:39:37.04 --> 01:39:41.92
It's just crazy. And so we would go up there and we'd like test my prosthetics and the ladders.

1077
01:39:41.92 --> 01:39:47.20
We'd, you know, obviously go across, you know, move along the fixed lines. We'd went up to camp 1 and

1078
01:39:47.20 --> 01:39:54.80
we, you know, came all the way back down. And after doing that, I actually made the decision that I

1079
01:39:54.80 --> 01:40:03.68
wasn't going to come below camp 1 again. So climb high and slip low a couple of times and then finally

1080
01:40:04.56 --> 01:40:09.92
my team left me at camp 1 and everybody else went back down. And I see it, I see it at camp 1 for

1081
01:40:09.92 --> 01:40:16.000
above 20,000 feet for almost four weeks. And your decision to do that was just to get better

1082
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.72
acclimated or to avoid the kumbu ice fall or you just, because I can't move fast through that stuff.

1083
01:40:20.72 --> 01:40:25.84
And then not, yeah, I just, I knew that going up and down through that, like that's just another

1084
01:40:25.84 --> 01:40:32.56
variable and more risk. I know for a fact that I can withstand 20,000 feet. So it was really just kind of,

1085
01:40:32.56 --> 01:40:37.92
you know, weighing the pros and cons of both. And in my opinion, like again, if something happened to me,

1086
01:40:37.92 --> 01:40:42.96
when I'm sitting in the middle of this valley at 20,000 feet, then it's just me. I mean, I was out there by myself

1087
01:40:42.96 --> 01:40:49.44
in a tent. And there's no one. But if I was in the kumbu and there's my team and then another 20

1088
01:40:49.44 --> 01:40:55.20
people who are also like doing the same thing and in something happens and I don't know, that's just a huge

1089
01:40:55.20 --> 01:40:59.68
cross-to-bear. So I'd rather be solo and something happened than go back to the kumbu.

1090
01:41:00.48 --> 01:41:07.36
How many people are on your team? So we had two locals. My buddy's Robin Chris and then a couple of

1091
01:41:07.36 --> 01:41:13.28
archie's me two Americans, Robin Chris, then two locals. That's the team right there. Who are Robin

1092
01:41:13.28 --> 01:41:18.48
Chris? So Chris is actually, I do that's climbed with me a few times. He'd actually did Albrist

1093
01:41:18.48 --> 01:41:26.48
in Akhenko with me and then Rob, and he's a stud. He was my cinematographer for Ferdinalli. And then

1094
01:41:26.48 --> 01:41:31.04
I decided that he's just, I mean, he's a mountain goat. So I was like, you know, I want you to be a part

1095
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:36.48
of my team, obviously, because you can handle things when it hits the fan. But also, like, you're

1096
01:41:36.48 --> 01:41:44.96
going to film this far. So at what point, so you get to camp two, you spend four weeks or no,

1097
01:41:44.96 --> 01:41:49.52
it's a camp one you spent four weeks at. I just spent four weeks above 20,000 feet. Okay,

1098
01:41:49.52 --> 01:41:53.60
got it. And then at what point is the decision point? Like, okay, it's our go time.

1099
01:41:54.48 --> 01:42:01.28
So it would have been, we get word, I mean, it's all a weather game out there. So we get word that

1100
01:42:01.28 --> 01:42:05.36
there's a really nice weather window. And it's long, there's not a cloud in the sky, the wind's

1101
01:42:05.36 --> 01:42:13.92
perfect. And then we get word that about 250 of the 330 climbers are going to be trying for

1102
01:42:13.92 --> 01:42:20.88
that same weather window. And I just went back and I thought about things. And my biggest fear

1103
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:26.40
on what I'm climbing isn't dying. You know, my biggest fear is getting frostbite and losing more of

1104
01:42:27.60 --> 01:42:33.52
my, you know, already very short limb. So I sat there and I reflected and said, you know what,

1105
01:42:33.52 --> 01:42:38.72
I can't get stuck in that line. A, because like what happens if my client partners run out of oxygen,

1106
01:42:38.72 --> 01:42:42.80
there are no options, there's no going up or down. Like, I run the risk of losing, you know,

1107
01:42:42.80 --> 01:42:48.96
somebody that I care deeply about. Obviously, there's the risk of frostbite. I run warm. I have

1108
01:42:48.96 --> 01:42:53.36
an elevated heart rate because of my injuries. So I'm using more oxygen. Like, there was just

1109
01:42:53.36 --> 01:42:57.12
too much. There was too much to like deal with other people. And not only that, but what happens if

1110
01:42:57.12 --> 01:43:02.08
I get stuck behind somebody too. In my world, like, if you're on my team and we're climbing

1111
01:43:02.08 --> 01:43:06.72
together, like, you go at my pace. And some days I haul ass. Some days I'm moving a little bit slower

1112
01:43:06.72 --> 01:43:12.40
because of my leg. So me and the team decided that we were going to do is called threading the

1113
01:43:12.40 --> 01:43:19.04
needle and go for a much shorter weather window. And we didn't even know if the ropes are going

1114
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:23.92
to be fixed to the top. Right. So this is prior to this big window. You guys said, well, there's a

1115
01:43:23.92 --> 01:43:27.28
shorter window that's going to last however many days and we're going to go for it then. Yep.

1116
01:43:27.84 --> 01:43:34.64
We decided that we're going to go. We were one of the first teams did push. So. And then, and then

1117
01:43:37.20 --> 01:43:41.36
so you go up from camp two to camp three and then you stay camp three. How long do you say

1118
01:43:41.36 --> 01:43:46.88
there for? Just tonight. And then camp three to camp four another night. Yep. And then you sleep for

1119
01:43:46.88 --> 01:43:53.28
like three hours. I can't for and then you push the summit. So it goes camp four camp five. You just

1120
01:43:53.28 --> 01:43:59.68
there's no camp five. There's no camp six. So you went from straight from camp four

1121
01:44:01.04 --> 01:44:09.84
to and you guys made it to Hillary step. Yep. So so we made it as a so sound. We made it to

1122
01:44:09.84 --> 01:44:16.40
200 meters away from the summit. Okay. I should be really freaking proud actually. Like I should

1123
01:44:16.40 --> 01:44:22.08
say that a little more enthusiastically. But yeah, no, I mean we made it to the south summit. So I'm

1124
01:44:22.08 --> 01:44:27.60
obviously super proud of that. But yeah, it was a little disheartening to see it. I could throw a rock

1125
01:44:27.60 --> 01:44:33.92
at it. And that's um yeah, I mean when you look at those pictures when you see and Hillary step

1126
01:44:33.92 --> 01:44:42.64
has changed I think in 2015 it changed from like this big kind of a like a 10 meter like 12 meter

1127
01:44:42.64 --> 01:44:47.44
something rock. And now it's like a little bit. It looks like something happened to it. Yeah.

1128
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:54.16
Earth greater something. And so but that's where you guys made it to. And once again, you faced with

1129
01:44:54.16 --> 01:45:01.92
this tough decision to make of like, do we press and go? And it's a huge risk. I had a friend

1130
01:45:01.92 --> 01:45:10.000
that tried to climb Everest and he was a total stud. And he was like, I mean a total stud. And

1131
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:19.68
he was like, yeah, you know, every step is a freaking nightmare. Like it is so hard. It's like you

1132
01:45:19.68 --> 01:45:26.000
can't describe how hard it is. Because people think, hey, you were 200 meters. Come on. Yeah,

1133
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.64
you got right. Yeah. No, I mean when it was bizarre too. So actually like at the moment when we were

1134
01:45:32.64 --> 01:45:40.88
going to turn around or we did turn around, I was above everybody by I don't know 20 yards maybe.

1135
01:45:41.60 --> 01:45:45.36
And so the local Sherpa actually made his way up to me at the anchor and said,

1136
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:50.32
they're out of oxygen. You and I can keep going up to the summit.

1137
01:45:50.32 --> 01:45:55.52
Um, you know, are we can turn around? And so I'm like, I'm looking at them.

1138
01:45:57.36 --> 01:46:03.20
Our entire like summit push was rough. I mean, it was in just total insanity. And I just remember

1139
01:46:03.20 --> 01:46:08.64
looking at them and both of the thing having this look of just exhaustion and just fear.

1140
01:46:09.36 --> 01:46:13.44
I'm like, no, I'm not doing this. Okay. There's that doesn't mean that much to me, you know.

1141
01:46:13.44 --> 01:46:16.72
Would they have sat there and waited for you to come back because they don't have a sharper

1142
01:46:16.72 --> 01:46:20.24
or they just turn around and go. They would just turn around and go, but that's even, I mean, that's even more

1143
01:46:20.24 --> 01:46:23.60
dangerous too. Yeah. Because then I have no oxygen. I have, you don't even know how it gets out.

1144
01:46:23.60 --> 01:46:29.12
It's like, versus yeah. I guess is a bad situation. And so I'm not only that, but like, why would I only go up with one

1145
01:46:29.12 --> 01:46:34.000
shirt, but that I don't really even know. You know, so it's like, I was just in the end. And it was so

1146
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.40
strange too. I think I think about the summertime because if you would have seen my reaction to turn around on

1147
01:46:38.40 --> 01:46:43.76
Denali, I was pissed. Like I practically shoved this camera back in Rob's face. I'm like,

1148
01:46:43.76 --> 01:46:48.64
angry that, you know, that it's all fallen apart. And then that's after 17 days is sitting

1149
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:56.72
very rare. I'm starving. But then I mean this time, like I just looked down at Rob and was like,

1150
01:46:56.72 --> 01:47:01.12
no, I was at total peace with this situation. I mean, took you wrong. I could have loved to

1151
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:05.36
sum it, but I just, and I also wouldn't have felt right. Like, I mean, I have been through so much

1152
01:47:05.36 --> 01:47:10.48
with those two dudes for two months at this point, on Everest. Like, yeah, later. Yes, yeah, I'm not

1153
01:47:10.48 --> 01:47:18.96
like a summit now. I mean, I just couldn't do it. Um, yeah. Then, and coming down is not it. It's not like

1154
01:47:18.96 --> 01:47:25.20
once you turn around. Okay. Now we're good. Oh, no. Once you turn around, it's still a nightmare. That's where

1155
01:47:25.20 --> 01:47:29.76
everyone dies is on the way down because they, they, like you said earlier, they get summit fever and they

1156
01:47:29.76 --> 01:47:33.92
exhaust everything that they have to get up to the top. And they just lay down and go to sleep on the

1157
01:47:33.92 --> 01:47:38.88
on the way down. They're done. Um, and it was, I mean, especially for me, like with the prosthetic,

1158
01:47:38.88 --> 01:47:43.92
they're going up. I have a technique. I mean, it just tons of right leg lunges and tricep dips

1159
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:48.24
and, I mean, it's intense, but on the way down, there's no technique. It's just forward and

1160
01:47:48.24 --> 01:47:52.80
meant to them. Like, the best thing that I can do for myself is know how to fall down. Um,

1161
01:47:53.52 --> 01:47:58.40
so yeah, I mean, because you fall a lot when you're coming down. I mean, I better know how to fall.

1162
01:47:58.40 --> 01:48:01.92
This is a little bit of a day's off when you're coming down.

1163
01:48:02.64 --> 01:48:07.68
That leaves a better not a catch myself. Do you, do you change legs for coming down? No, I don't.

1164
01:48:07.68 --> 01:48:11.84
And is that because it's impractical? Is that because it doesn't make any difference?

1165
01:48:11.84 --> 01:48:15.60
There's a making a difference. No. Yeah. I mean, so they actually, the only thing out there right now

1166
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:21.68
for people like me are the, for us to be able to climb the way that I'm climbing is the feet that

1167
01:48:21.68 --> 01:48:27.04
I make, I make them myself. So there's not many options to change of anyways.

1168
01:48:29.36 --> 01:48:34.24
Okay. And you get down your at peace with a decision. How long did the weather hold for?

1169
01:48:34.24 --> 01:48:41.04
Oh, quite some time actually for days. Okay. I mean, which was of course, I mean, that's

1170
01:48:41.04 --> 01:48:45.76
sad for me because I'm sitting here watching these people go up, but I mean, your bodies are so

1171
01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:51.60
trash after being at, you know, 26, 27, 28,000 feet for so long. Like, and if you're out of oxygen,

1172
01:48:51.60 --> 01:48:57.44
you're out of oxygen, like, at that point, you're pretty much tapped. Um, and so I mean, even after

1173
01:48:57.44 --> 01:49:03.12
we made it back down to base camp, I mean, coming down like through camp 3 and 2, like, I was

1174
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:08.32
so at peace with everything because I'm watching these zoos of people come up. Yeah. I mean,

1175
01:49:08.32 --> 01:49:12.40
hundreds of people, and in that moment I was like, you know what, you did the right thing. You're not

1176
01:49:12.40 --> 01:49:15.92
one of the ants. You're not one of the minions. Like, you were savior smart. I mean,

1177
01:49:15.92 --> 01:49:19.44
I'd be wrong, like, when I got back down to base camp, but definitely, I was like, do you have

1178
01:49:19.44 --> 01:49:23.92
any to do another attempt? Like, what's up? But I mean, just the weather wasn't going to hold

1179
01:49:23.92 --> 01:49:30.40
that anyways. So yeah, the, he image is coming back from the Everest this year of the lines of

1180
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:38.08
people has been crazy to say. Yeah. Literally, the entire like ridge to the summit is one way

1181
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:42.80
traffic jam. Yeah. And to me, that's not what Mal and Irina is, you know, like, in my opinion,

1182
01:49:42.80 --> 01:49:49.04
like that totally discredits, but what all it should be, um, you know, I'm glad that I was out there

1183
01:49:49.04 --> 01:49:55.36
with me and my thoughts and literally two other people. Okay, four kind of a trip up. But yeah,

1184
01:49:55.36 --> 01:50:00.000
you write, you, you covered all this in a really good detail on your, on your blog, which is,

1185
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:08.16
which is cool. Uh, you get done. You come back, you acclimate. At what point did you go back and

1186
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:15.68
and go to Cordo Poxy again? I was month. So you just did. Yeah. And this time?

1187
01:50:16.24 --> 01:50:20.16
Yeah, it was successful. Successful. Yeah. I'm crushing you. You got up there. And

1188
01:50:22.32 --> 01:50:26.56
now you're here. What, what did you come to San Diego for? Because we've been trying to do this podcast for

1189
01:50:26.56 --> 01:50:31.68
a while. No. And finally, and I was, I, I looked at your social media. Because I, I didn't know

1190
01:50:31.68 --> 01:50:35.36
why you were coming out here. And then I put two and two together with your social media. Really,

1191
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:41.36
it's why you're coming out here. Yeah. I'm a way you're here for. I'm actually only in San Diego.

1192
01:50:41.36 --> 01:50:47.20
Very briefly. I am headed down to Mexico to race the North 500. Explain with it in the

1193
01:50:47.20 --> 01:50:54.56
North 500 days. It is pretty extreme off road race. And we're actually at me and a sweet friend of mine are actually

1194
01:50:55.44 --> 01:51:02.80
racing and a rebuilt flyer vehicle. I'm a military vehicle. It's like a light strike vehicle.

1195
01:51:02.80 --> 01:51:06.72
Right. I was pretty sweet. But for the miles, what kind of support do you get on that?

1196
01:51:06.72 --> 01:51:12.96
I'm very none. So it's a, we have a pick crew, which is really one deed in a field truck that

1197
01:51:12.96 --> 01:51:16.64
can kind of chase us down. But if you break down, I mean, you're going to be stuck there for hours.

1198
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:21.76
So. So you better hope your machine's running good. Yes, correct. And that's the next

1199
01:51:23.44 --> 01:51:29.44
damn adventure on your list is that. Yeah. How long is it take to get that done?

1200
01:51:29.44 --> 01:51:33.68
I only do it. I mean, you race them. And it's a consistent thing. So you'll, you're race today.

1201
01:51:33.68 --> 01:51:40.000
I'll be back in San Diego on Sunday back in Colorado, Sunday night to hustle and work my tail off.

1202
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.08
And yeah. What are you working your tail off when you get back? Everything from speaking

1203
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:49.36
gigs to the real estate team that I do with my mom. I'm opening a CrossFit gym up here in

1204
01:51:49.36 --> 01:51:55.36
Vista, um, dabbling with a bunch. But I'm going to work my work until Thanksgiving that I'm

1205
01:51:55.36 --> 01:51:59.84
going to take some time off. Yeah. So those are the things that you've got on on on on the

1206
01:51:59.84 --> 01:52:06.56
schedule right now, opening a gym real estate ski season is going to start. Yes. And I can't wait.

1207
01:52:06.56 --> 01:52:11.12
So you'll be up there. Where do you usually snowboard out? All over like throwing

1208
01:52:11.12 --> 01:52:16.64
for Gbelly. So it has been snowmass. Yep. And you live up in that area as well, right? Yes.

1209
01:52:16.64 --> 01:52:24.72
Very lucky. Check. I mean, so we're kind of up to date right now. I wanted to cover one more

1210
01:52:24.72 --> 01:52:31.20
little chunk of writing before we actually close it out. Could you get some really cool writing?

1211
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.76
Thank you. So here we go. I had joined the Marine Corps to serve people.

1212
01:52:35.76 --> 01:52:40.96
Then in a mere 23 years old, I was looking to repurpose myself. Now at 27 years old,

1213
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:45.84
I'm still serving people just in a different capacity. Nothing about my injuries has been easy.

1214
01:52:46.64 --> 01:52:52.000
But what I'm thankful for, regardless of the pain and grief are the people and experiences

1215
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.12
that have come my way. Four years ago, I was petrified of what my life may become.

1216
01:52:58.16 --> 01:53:04.08
Now I couldn't be more proud. I fought for it. I worked for it harder than you can ever dream of.

1217
01:53:04.08 --> 01:53:11.68
But I didn't get here alone. Family friends, believers, everyone who is there from the start. Thank you.

1218
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.88
Appreciate all of your days. Even when you're writing in the rain. In the beginning of my recovery,

1219
01:53:20.88 --> 01:53:29.36
I struggled a lot and it made me a biter and sometimes mean person. How disabled do I have to make

1220
01:53:29.36 --> 01:53:36.48
myself feel before I give up? How much easier would this be had I done it on two legs?

1221
01:53:38.64 --> 01:53:45.12
My heart hurt in a way that then I couldn't even tell when I was hurting the people around me.

1222
01:53:45.12 --> 01:53:52.16
Family included. Not that it's an excuse, but no that if I caused you any pain,

1223
01:53:52.16 --> 01:54:00.80
I'm sorry. I'm not perfect. No one like claim to be. Realistically none of us ever will be.

1224
01:54:02.56 --> 01:54:07.28
It's all about the progress over perfection and taking steps in the right direction.

1225
01:54:08.40 --> 01:54:14.000
The last couple of years, I've been working on me as a whole. I've been focusing on the person.

1226
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.28
I want to be and recognizing a lot about the person I was. I've tried to surround myself with people

1227
01:54:19.28 --> 01:54:26.64
who wish the best for others and build them up. Not break them down. I've stepped away from the

1228
01:54:26.64 --> 01:54:36.72
toxic people that had a negative hold on me. If someone has wronged you, forgive them. Unshackle

1229
01:54:36.72 --> 01:54:45.04
yourself from that pain. I started living my life for others, not for myself and life is so much

1230
01:54:45.04 --> 01:54:54.80
sweeter that way. The truth is I'm doing more now than I ever did on two legs. I've been surrounded

1231
01:54:54.80 --> 01:55:03.52
by people who keep me inspired and keep me looking onward and upward. Now I can't stop.

1232
01:55:05.20 --> 01:55:12.40
I have suffered loss. That's no secret. But look at all I've gained. How the low points

1233
01:55:12.40 --> 01:55:17.84
had the low points in my life not happened. I would not have had the amazing friendships or

1234
01:55:17.84 --> 01:55:28.000
experiences I do. I'm thankful for the highs and the lows. Life has a funny way of putting us

1235
01:55:29.12 --> 01:55:41.52
exactly where we are meant to be. Well, Curse the I think that it seems that you have been to put exactly

1236
01:55:41.52 --> 01:55:50.56
where you are supposed to be on this path, living this amazing life and inspiring so many other

1237
01:55:50.56 --> 01:55:57.04
people. Where can people find you? Yeah, I mean everyone can follow along on of course social media,

1238
01:55:57.04 --> 01:56:02.08
Facebook and Instagram, just my name, Curse the Ns. But if you're interested in any of these blogs

1239
01:56:02.08 --> 01:56:06.96
or the writing, they're all up on my foundation's website. So, Curse the Ns Foundation.org.

1240
01:56:06.96 --> 01:56:10.96
Are you sure it's not Curse the Ns Foundation.com?

1241
01:56:10.96 --> 01:56:19.52
It's both. Okay. Just checking. So, you know, one of us. Awesome. Awesome. So, you are really cool stuff

1242
01:56:19.52 --> 01:56:25.12
that you post on that. The detailed description of your climbing are really, really cool.

1243
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:30.56
Is that documentary posted that you were talking about? No, yeah. Okay. So, we'll be waiting for that.

1244
01:56:30.56 --> 01:56:38.000
Let me know. So, I can repost it. No, awesome. Just awesome to talk to you. I know that we,

1245
01:56:38.56 --> 01:56:43.20
we try and stay on the path around here. You know, the path, the righteous path. Yes, sir.

1246
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:49.68
Yeah, Coach, I'll speak another righteous path. Yeah. Curse the leading from the front. What can we do

1247
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:55.28
ourselves to kind of move down the path? You know, Rob is speaking. Plany can. Plany stuff.

1248
01:56:55.28 --> 01:57:02.72
Um, but first, there it is. But first, well, you know, like throughout the story,

1249
01:57:03.68 --> 01:57:07.44
you know, there's little pockets of maybe like, oh wait, well, you know, small detail. So,

1250
01:57:07.44 --> 01:57:12.80
you said the pilot was D.O.R. What does D.O.R mean? Drop on request. Oh, thank.

1251
01:57:12.80 --> 01:57:19.44
Meaning I don't want to do this anymore. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Also, I thought, you know,

1252
01:57:19.44 --> 01:57:24.32
that we mentioned like how you'd have, um, like challenges with your memory. Like just going to the

1253
01:57:24.32 --> 01:57:27.92
bathroom, like hey, why am I here kind of think? Yep. You've watched the movie Momental?

1254
01:57:27.92 --> 01:57:31.44
Oh, my goodness. No, but you were the second person at the time of that in two days. Yeah,

1255
01:57:31.44 --> 01:57:35.76
I should definitely watch that movie. It's very cool. Yeah. So, it's the guy, you know what it's about

1256
01:57:35.76 --> 01:57:42.80
the end. It's about this guy. Lannard. He doesn't like to be called Lannian. Anyway, he has short-term

1257
01:57:42.80 --> 01:57:48.16
memory loss, right? So he can't make new memories. He has long-term and so he can do like

1258
01:57:48.16 --> 01:57:52.40
habitual stuff. You know, stuff that I guess he uses a different part of your brain. So like habitual

1259
01:57:52.40 --> 01:57:56.72
stuff, driving a car like that kind of stuff you can do. And he has his long-term memory, like he knows

1260
01:57:56.72 --> 01:58:01.20
about his wife and his who he is and stuff. But he can't, he basically he goes to the bathroom,

1261
01:58:01.20 --> 01:58:08.32
like why am I here? Yeah. So he has all these tattoos kind of like you except his are like notes,

1262
01:58:08.32 --> 01:58:13.04
you know, like, like, yourself. Yeah, but they're everywhere, you know. And then he takes these polaroids

1263
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:17.84
of the people. So it's like, oh, yeah, I know you, you know, and then it's really good and it

1264
01:58:17.84 --> 01:58:22.88
goes backwards. The movie goes backwards. So you don't it's like you follow along with them.

1265
01:58:22.88 --> 01:58:26.72
You know. So it's like, oh, how did he get there? And you don't know, you know, he'll just wake up

1266
01:58:26.72 --> 01:58:32.40
in the room with an empty bottle. I'll be like, I don't know. It's like naked, you know, like that kind.

1267
01:58:32.40 --> 01:58:35.60
And you're like, oh, I didn't that have you, you know, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1268
01:58:35.60 --> 01:58:42.16
That's what you remind me of the whole bathroom thing. But as far as the path goes,

1269
01:58:42.16 --> 01:58:50.64
we're doing you to do what it starts. You ever try your energy to do to surprise me because isn't

1270
01:58:50.64 --> 01:58:57.68
it interesting? You snowboard. I don't know how to snowboard. And these may or may not apply to you

1271
01:58:57.68 --> 01:59:03.12
because you're different. I think, but I don't know how to snowboard. I probably couldn't climb

1272
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.20
I can barely climb my driveway. You're talking about everything, all these things. I don't have

1273
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:17.68
a hair salon. You don't say. Yeah. Many reasons. And I have two legs, you know, and I don't know.

1274
01:59:17.68 --> 01:59:23.60
It seems like, you know, like when you say, okay, it depends on how you react to like all these things.

1275
01:59:23.60 --> 01:59:27.92
It's like your reaction is like you chose to go for like these huge reactions.

1276
01:59:28.64 --> 01:59:34.32
It's not like this weird, impossible thing, you know. It's like, if you have everything kind of

1277
01:59:34.32 --> 01:59:40.48
in front of you, you're less likely to have that big reaction. You mean if everything is

1278
01:59:40.48 --> 01:59:45.20
almost easy for you to achieve, you'd have a less of a probability of trying to make it happen. Yeah.

1279
01:59:45.20 --> 01:59:51.04
And then as a certain, I guess with you, you were kind of always like that, right?

1280
01:59:51.04 --> 01:59:55.92
Yeah. Yeah. You're like, okay, I'm going to make things happen in this.

1281
01:59:56.72 --> 02:00:03.20
Maybe extra ordinary way. You know, good or bad, or, you know, mischievous or whatever,

1282
02:00:03.20 --> 02:00:08.000
like you can, you kind of started with that. So I guess in the big picture kind of makes sense.

1283
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:11.68
You know, but then from the outside, you kind of look in, but yeah, like you know how you say it,

1284
02:00:11.68 --> 02:00:18.16
or you've talked about this before, where if you're handed everything, yeah, you know, like you won't go

1285
02:00:19.84 --> 02:00:25.92
case important. What are the chances that you would be attempting to summon Everest if you

1286
02:00:25.92 --> 02:00:32.40
got out of the Marine Corps after six years? And you know what I mean? Like it's just, you have these challenges

1287
02:00:32.40 --> 02:00:38.48
and because it's like because they're hard and even harder than normal, that you want to do

1288
02:00:38.48 --> 02:00:43.60
them even more. Yes, no exactly. That's kind of what you're saying. Yeah. Well, I think too, like,

1289
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:48.32
I'm like an obnoxious thinking competitive person, but not necessarily with other people.

1290
02:00:48.32 --> 02:00:52.000
And it's just, I look at what I did yesterday and I say, okay, well, what can I do a little bit more?

1291
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.12
Whether that's something physical or mental or whatever? But then also like, honestly, I mean,

1292
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:01.20
I'm not the fastest person out there. I struggle my way up. I'm not perfect out in the mountains

1293
02:01:01.20 --> 02:01:05.76
or anything that I'm doing. But I really do. I hope that there's somebody out there watching

1294
02:01:05.76 --> 02:01:10.16
me and they said to health cursey, I can do it better than her. And then I hope that they try.

1295
02:01:10.16 --> 02:01:14.80
I mean, that's what it's about. You know, like, I want some to see it. Do it.

1296
02:01:14.80 --> 02:01:19.76
Kind of goes to show. Also, you talk better than me too, by the way. So there's that.

1297
02:01:21.12 --> 02:01:27.04
Yeah, multiple brain damage, fear, the. Nothing happened to my jaw. Yeah.

1298
02:01:27.04 --> 02:01:31.76
And then you talk way better than me. So like I said, it goes to show anyway. You did too.

1299
02:01:31.76 --> 02:01:36.88
Oh, you've done due to the two. So are you currently doing due to two? No, I was training for a little bit

1300
02:01:36.88 --> 02:01:41.28
of the night. And then I really fell in love with MMA and then just boxing. Yeah, yeah.

1301
02:01:41.28 --> 02:01:45.28
Yeah, yeah. We're good with all the above, actually. Yeah. We just like, we just like that you

1302
02:01:45.28 --> 02:01:51.76
scrap. Yes. Fighting in general is good. Well, I mean, I think when I started training as when I

1303
02:01:51.76 --> 02:01:56.16
realized, like, I'm an anger little person. And it's good to get it out. I like it.

1304
02:01:56.16 --> 02:01:58.16
And then you elbow. I'm just saying. Yeah.

1305
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:03.76
And then you. That's good. Well, these are all elements of the path included on the path. So

1306
02:02:04.48 --> 02:02:08.56
as far as jujitsu goes, if you do geek, you need a geek. If you do geek. Yeah.

1307
02:02:08.96 --> 02:02:13.92
Which you show hand in hand. I think you should, you can do one or the other. I guess, but

1308
02:02:13.92 --> 02:02:19.20
ideally geek, no geek both. Well, what are you trying to get to is we have a company. We make

1309
02:02:19.20 --> 02:02:25.28
jujitsu geese. We make rash guards. We make t-shirts. Sure. And we make them all in America, which is

1310
02:02:26.08 --> 02:02:32.24
awesome from the dirt to the shirt, from the dirt to the shirt, from the cotton to the from the seed to the

1311
02:02:32.24 --> 02:02:39.84
bee. All made. And we're actually making jeans to make it. Yeah. American. Yeah. American.

1312
02:02:39.84 --> 02:02:46.40
Yeah. Don't dare to. Yeah. Jocca doesn't like fashion or fashion. Don't think you're right. The

1313
02:02:46.40 --> 02:02:52.72
both. I think I'm a fashion or a fashion. I wasn't a aesthetic. Uh, like that's why you

1314
02:02:52.72 --> 02:02:59.44
know about cosmopolitan. So cosmopolitan. It's like the if you think magazines, what do you think

1315
02:02:59.44 --> 02:03:03.92
people time. Do you think that's more polished? You're too magazine. And you just

1316
02:03:03.92 --> 02:03:09.36
make it. Yeah. But. Cosmopolitan magazines anymore. No, that's why they're out there making videos.

1317
02:03:09.36 --> 02:03:14.56
Cosmopolitan. They're out there making videos because they know no one's reading a magazine. It's

1318
02:03:14.56 --> 02:03:19.20
for you. You know what? I will tell you. I used to be a sucker for. I'm talking maybe

1319
02:03:19.84 --> 02:03:27.20
even even up to eight years ago. If I was in the airport, I'd like walk through this shop and see

1320
02:03:27.20 --> 02:03:32.80
like a magazine. Right? I don't know if it was a gun magazine. I don't know if it was a car magazine.

1321
02:03:32.80 --> 02:03:37.68
I don't know if it was a outdoor magazine. But like one of those magazines, I'd say, oh, you know,

1322
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:44.16
I got a flight. Hey, I'll read this magazine eight years ago. I may have bought. I would, there was

1323
02:03:44.16 --> 02:03:50.72
a 70% chance that I'd see a magazine. It looked kind of cool. And I'd get the magazine. Right now,

1324
02:03:50.72 --> 02:03:56.64
there is a zero percent chance of getting a paper magazine. Yeah. Zero percent. Yeah. That's, I mean,

1325
02:03:56.64 --> 02:04:00.80
I guess one, what do you call it? The people who like they learn they yearning for the past,

1326
02:04:00.80 --> 02:04:03.28
what is it? What is it? What is it? Kind of person. A person that yearns for the past.

1327
02:04:03.28 --> 02:04:07.76
Anyway, there's a word for that kind of person anyway. So it may be that part of me,

1328
02:04:07.76 --> 02:04:12.40
maybe still likes. Get you to that speech. See, see, get things working. I'm so

1329
02:04:12.40 --> 02:04:18.000
over to my word recollection. See, I can't, you understand what I'm saying. Anyway,

1330
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.40
people who are nostalgic like that, they like the physical magazine. I'm one of those people. Yeah.

1331
02:04:22.40 --> 02:04:26.64
But here's the thing, which, I mean, I'm, you probably realize this, you have your phone. So like,

1332
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:30.56
yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm a person. You can read,

1333
02:04:30.56 --> 02:04:34.48
you know, all the stuff that you read or whatever, you're that is what I'm saying. You don't need

1334
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:38.16
the physical magazine anymore. And then you got to lug around a physical magazine. You're done with

1335
02:04:38.16 --> 02:04:42.08
what I'm saying. That's why I'm saying no one's reading the magazine anymore. Even me. And I

1336
02:04:42.08 --> 02:04:46.56
used to buy them. Yeah, but that's why. That's why. But that's something. But that doesn't

1337
02:04:46.56 --> 02:04:52.40
explain. Do you get magazines? No. I think the back cookbooks. But that's not a magazine. No.

1338
02:04:52.40 --> 02:04:58.16
Oh, there's a cook. We call a week all a cookbook magazine. I'm a cook magazine. Oh, yeah,

1339
02:04:58.16 --> 02:05:03.52
I like the magazine. Yeah, like, we don't know. It's a black-to-cooking. You like to cook? I do. Yes.

1340
02:05:03.52 --> 02:05:12.88
Uh, you're as lit up right there. I love to go. You love to eat. Yes. Both. Yes. I love to eat.

1341
02:05:14.80 --> 02:05:20.72
It's not that I don't love to cook or even really like to do it. I just maybe not that great at it.

1342
02:05:20.72 --> 02:05:27.28
You like to do that. I can do it. I can make a good salad. Yeah. Funny. I can make a good steak. So

1343
02:05:27.28 --> 02:05:33.84
anyways, origin USA origin main.com. If you want any of this stuff, we also have supplements.

1344
02:05:34.72 --> 02:05:38.40
You've been drinking some chocolate, chocolate, white tea over there. Yeah, what you're verdict.

1345
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:41.60
I'm a fan. I think it's great. You got a big smile on your face. Yeah.

1346
02:05:41.60 --> 02:05:44.88
More than you had earlier. I think it. I think it not only gives you an 8,000 pound

1347
02:05:44.88 --> 02:05:49.84
deadlift. It will make you smile on you. Well, in a way, it kind of is misleading because when you

1348
02:05:49.84 --> 02:05:54.40
look at the can, there's no like, high-biscuits or pomegranate, like fruity,

1349
02:05:54.40 --> 02:05:58.88
tartare and so the magic image. Yeah. That's right. I'm not going to joke.

1350
02:05:58.88 --> 02:06:04.16
It's tactical. It looks kind of tactically, seems ain't like it. But then when you drink it certified

1351
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:08.72
organic, goiny and very light, very refreshing, seems same. So it's like a thing. So like when you

1352
02:06:08.72 --> 02:06:13.20
drink it, you're pleasantly surprised. I think on a subconscious level. Yeah, so we've got to

1353
02:06:13.20 --> 02:06:18.000
bunch of different things and one thing I do have to say is we got, so I make this a little drink.

1354
02:06:19.04 --> 02:06:23.52
It's called discipline and there's a powder form. And we just came out with a powder form.

1355
02:06:23.52 --> 02:06:29.28
that's called jockel. Do you like do you like Arnold Palmer's? I do. Okay, so I'm I like I love them.

1356
02:06:30.40 --> 02:06:34.56
I said I made that right there. It's called jockel Palmer. That's hilarious. Yeah, well, I

1357
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:42.72
ran a lot. We did away with it for with it for, but yeah, so anyways, it tastes so good. It tastes like

1358
02:06:42.72 --> 02:06:48.08
the best Arnold Palmer that you get from, you know, the restaurant Arnold Palmer's when they do a good job.

1359
02:06:48.08 --> 02:06:54.80
Oh, good job. Okay, you go. Oh, you say Arnold Palmer and they just they just do a good job. And you're like, yes

1360
02:06:55.36 --> 02:07:00.08
This is kind of what it's like. So anyways, that's available and a bunch of other supplements.

1361
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:02.08
Mulk, joint warfare,

1362
02:07:02.96 --> 02:07:07.84
krill krill, super, super, krill, oil. Yeah, that's for your kids.

1363
02:07:07.84 --> 02:07:12.88
Mulk, for your kid. For your kid. For when your kids need something good to eat.

1364
02:07:12.88 --> 02:07:21.36
And instead of giving them level nine cheetos. Yeah. No, don't get them that. So yeah, you can get that.

1365
02:07:21.36 --> 02:07:28.88
Yeah, all in origin, main.com. It should be and.org apparently because actually that's smart

1366
02:07:28.88 --> 02:07:33.36
when you do the dot org and the dot com. So, and you know, when you go and go daddy and they tell you,

1367
02:07:33.36 --> 02:07:39.44
hey, you want to buy the dot org, the dot net, the dot, uh, dot TV dot whatever dot biz, you know, all this stuff or

1368
02:07:39.44 --> 02:07:43.92
whatever, you say yes, if you have a good name, you say yes to all of those. That's a good strategy.

1369
02:07:43.92 --> 02:07:48.56
Yes. See, way ahead of the camera. Like it. She's not for there. Just get them. And then the last

1370
02:07:48.56 --> 02:07:56.08
origin, main.com. That's the go to as we can get this good stuff. Yeah. Also, we have a store. It's called

1371
02:07:56.08 --> 02:08:02.72
Jocco store. See, you're probably going to kind of figure out real together. Yeah. You know, it's

1372
02:08:02.72 --> 02:08:10.64
an end. So, Jocco Palmer is not a genius name. I know. It's a name as a result of lack of

1373
02:08:10.64 --> 02:08:15.36
genius. Okay. You're like, Arnold Palmer. There's genius. There's a good boy. There's genius in

1374
02:08:15.36 --> 02:08:21.68
some. Let me some credit. Actually, that is true. Nonetheless, so if Joc once an online store was

1375
02:08:21.68 --> 02:08:26.88
going to go bottom line is I'm so unoriginal that I just, starting with this podcast, I just said,

1376
02:08:26.88 --> 02:08:31.68
we'll just call it Jocco podcast and now it's like sort of just everything. Yeah. Hey, we need

1377
02:08:31.68 --> 02:08:36.000
a online store. What do we call it? We don't do it that way. No, no, no. Because now you look back,

1378
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:43.12
if, if like four years ago, someone would say, okay, you're going to name all your stuff.

1379
02:08:43.12 --> 02:08:47.52
Jocco. I would've been like, no, that's, that's dumb. Yeah. But it didn't happen like that.

1380
02:08:47.52 --> 02:08:51.84
It happened like a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, next thing you know, you got Jocco

1381
02:08:51.84 --> 02:08:58.88
publishing. What? How did that even happen? The thing is a big picture, long game. It does make sense.

1382
02:08:58.88 --> 02:09:02.80
Yeah. No, no. Actually smart. I think you, the genius in simplicity, I think,

1383
02:09:02.80 --> 02:09:07.28
disapplies here. So nonetheless, JoccoStore.com is where you can get your shirts and

1384
02:09:07.28 --> 02:09:11.76
rash guards tank to all these stuff while you're representing on the path, disciplining equals freedom.

1385
02:09:12.72 --> 02:09:17.84
There's, I haven't really talked about this too much, but a guy, okay, so we got a t-shirt

1386
02:09:17.84 --> 02:09:23.20
that says discipline equals freedom in it. I don't want to say it's iconic, but there's only one

1387
02:09:23.20 --> 02:09:30.000
place in the world that you can get this t-shirt. This dude just got arrested in somewhere in his mugshot

1388
02:09:30.72 --> 02:09:35.60
is him. He's wearing a discipline equals freedom t-shirt. And he's sporting this thing.

1389
02:09:35.60 --> 02:09:40.72
Yeah. And what he did was apparently there was some kind of altercation and he beat up two people

1390
02:09:40.72 --> 02:09:44.64
and then dropped them off somewhere. Like out there, how? Yeah. Because what I think there were like

1391
02:09:44.64 --> 02:09:49.52
rugby players or something like, here's the thing. So when he, when I saw that article, you sent me that article.

1392
02:09:49.52 --> 02:09:55.36
He wasn't as much as it was his court appeared. Yeah. So he wears the destroyer actively went

1393
02:09:55.36 --> 02:10:00.000
to court. It wasn't like he got rolled up and then he just, he even courted. This is what he decided

1394
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.96
to wear to court. He's representing on the path. On the path. What serious? Because a lot of people

1395
02:10:04.96 --> 02:10:08.80
were like, oh, he's not on the path. Obviously he's getting arrested and rolled up. You were kind of like,

1396
02:10:08.80 --> 02:10:14.08
no, no, no, read a little bit more. I said, hey, we all represent the path in our own way. And this

1397
02:10:14.08 --> 02:10:20.96
guy is no different. So basically as far as the article goes, what I got from it was, okay,

1398
02:10:20.96 --> 02:10:25.52
him and his other friends who he probably found annoying at the time, they were drinking.

1399
02:10:28.32 --> 02:10:32.96
Some argument ensued in the car. He beat them both up. Real bad.

1400
02:10:33.76 --> 02:10:37.44
Okay. I don't know if it was in the car before that. That's where it gets a little bit of like

1401
02:10:37.44 --> 02:10:41.84
if you're friends, you can't beat them up real bad. Wait, wait, wait, what is real bad if you

1402
02:10:41.84 --> 02:10:46.72
insist? Well, they said they will, okay. And then the guys who got beat up, they were saying,

1403
02:10:46.72 --> 02:10:50.72
oh, I'm like, what are you threatening injuries or maybe they're lawyer or somebody was saying, oh,

1404
02:10:50.72 --> 02:10:55.04
my gosh, I'm critical. And then the medical professionals, they were like,

1405
02:10:56.16 --> 02:11:01.36
whatever they got beat up. They caught a beat down from the discipline he calls freedom guy. That's what

1406
02:11:01.36 --> 02:11:05.68
happened. Okay. Acting annoying and dropped. That's what I'm then he dropped him off at their house.

1407
02:11:05.68 --> 02:11:10.72
Okay. At this point, I will not issue and approved or disapproved. I'm remaining neutral

1408
02:11:10.72 --> 02:11:16.000
at this time until further evidence comes forth and I can make a decision whether these actions were

1409
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.96
approved or disapproved. Yeah. Agreed. But like I say, we all represent about in our own way.

1410
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:30.96
Unless he got that shirt, whether this means anything or not to us, even though it does,

1411
02:11:30.96 --> 02:11:36.24
he got it from jockelstore.com. So he can get and it's not just kind of crazy. There's other ones.

1412
02:11:36.24 --> 02:11:41.04
Is this beat? Because a little while ago in UFC, there was a guy wearing the shirt and like a bunch of people.

1413
02:11:42.08 --> 02:11:46.64
So now we're sort of this is headline news. Yeah, your means to it. Well, my brother text

1414
02:11:46.64 --> 02:11:52.88
me is like, hey, your your mainstream now. You know, listen to this. Speaking of tangents. So

1415
02:11:53.92 --> 02:12:03.20
my uncles were both used car salesmen and there was a crime that happened in the town where

1416
02:12:03.20 --> 02:12:08.40
one of my uncles was a used car salesman and at the crime scene, it was close to his used car

1417
02:12:08.40 --> 02:12:15.68
locked and in the picture that they took of the crime scene in the background, you could see the

1418
02:12:15.68 --> 02:12:21.92
sign for his, you know, VIX used cars. You could see in the background in the sign on the front page

1419
02:12:22.64 --> 02:12:28.80
and my uncle, because my uncles are hilarious. They cut it out. They sent it to my mom and he

1420
02:12:28.80 --> 02:12:33.76
would, you might uncle cut out the picture sent it to my mom and said, I told you I would make it

1421
02:12:33.76 --> 02:12:39.52
big time. And he might even want to come from here. So there you go. So we kind of, you know,

1422
02:12:40.80 --> 02:12:47.36
it's not nothing. We made that. Oh, it's not nothing. Yes. Yeah, we made the news. We're in criminal justice.

1423
02:12:47.36 --> 02:12:51.60
You know, that's where ever you go. It's just, it's just all happening. All right, real quick.

1424
02:12:51.60 --> 02:12:55.52
Subscribe to the podcast if you don't subscribe to this podcast. Echo doesn't think you subscribe to it

1425
02:12:55.52 --> 02:13:01.04
at this point. It proves echo wrong by subscribing to it. Don't forget about the warrior kid podcast.

1426
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.56
That's for your, it's for your children. And if you're a parent, it's very, very useful. Don't tell

1427
02:13:08.56 --> 02:13:14.08
anyone, don't tell your kids that you want to keep your kids thinking that this is like a little bit

1428
02:13:14.08 --> 02:13:19.20
unrelated to your thought process. Yeah, because that way, they don't do the little rebel thing,

1429
02:13:19.20 --> 02:13:24.24
like some people who sit in that this table right now, which is actually all of us. Yeah, so

1430
02:13:24.24 --> 02:13:29.92
check that out. Don't forget about the warrior kid soap, Irish Oaks Ranch.com, young Aiden,

1431
02:13:29.92 --> 02:13:38.80
making soap from goat milk, all natural, so that everyone in the world can stay clean.

1432
02:13:38.80 --> 02:13:45.20
Stay clean. We also have a YouTube channel. You want to see. Speaking of staying clean. Hold on.

1433
02:13:45.20 --> 02:13:53.04
Can I say something? Of course. Before we, we're, we're waiting for you downstairs and the front

1434
02:13:53.04 --> 02:13:56.80
desk roll at the gym. So the studio is at the gym for those of you. No, no, that's got to

1435
02:13:56.80 --> 02:14:03.92
Victor, a gym called Victory MMA in San Diego, California. The studio is in the gym. We were downstairs.

1436
02:14:03.92 --> 02:14:08.72
We were waiting for her courtesy to show up. And the front desk roll goes, hey,

1437
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:12.40
Jockel, I got a phone call someone wants to know where to train. Do you get to in this city?

1438
02:14:12.40 --> 02:14:15.36
In some city. Then I'm not going to say in case the point, however, you know,

1439
02:14:15.36 --> 02:14:22.64
privacy act or whatever. So, he's a front desk roll. Because says, what should I tell him? And I said,

1440
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:28.000
whoa, here, give me the phone. And I like pulled up and I go, hey, man, what's going on?

1441
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.64
And he's like, Jockel, I was like, hey, bro, what's happening? I hear you're looking at

1442
02:14:32.64 --> 02:14:36.40
training your Jitsu in your city. And I pulled out Google Maps. I was like, hey, there's a cool place

1443
02:14:36.40 --> 02:14:39.52
here. There's a bunch of good places. Yeah, you're good to go. And he's like, he's like, hey, man,

1444
02:14:39.52 --> 02:14:47.76
he goes, I was on Crystal Mf for seven years. He goes, I started listening to your podcast. I'm

1445
02:14:47.76 --> 02:14:54.88
clean. My family's back in order. My job is back in order. Please keep doing what you're doing.

1446
02:14:54.88 --> 02:15:01.68
I'm starting to train Jitsu. And I was like, bro, see you, I'll keep doing what I'm doing. You stay

1447
02:15:01.68 --> 02:15:09.36
on the path and stay clean. So right on to you out there, you know who you are. Now I'm not saying

1448
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:13.20
if you call victory MMA in fitness, that I'm going to answer because I'm not. I was probably the first time

1449
02:15:13.20 --> 02:15:20.16
I've talked on the phone here in a year. Yeah. So also, that's not to be confused with you using

1450
02:15:20.96 --> 02:15:26.32
trooper soap or Jockel soap. I'm going to rehabilitate your drugs. It will not help your

1451
02:15:26.32 --> 02:15:30.16
crystal method and fed me to have it. It might, but that's not the thing. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.

1452
02:15:30.16 --> 02:15:33.92
You can't claim it, but there's little triggers that you could have that could make you want to stay

1453
02:15:33.92 --> 02:15:39.60
clean. Maybe that soap, goat soap, it's bottom of them. You could be super stoked with that.

1454
02:15:39.60 --> 02:15:44.56
Psychological Warfare, you can get that from iTunes, Google Play. If you need that little

1455
02:15:45.84 --> 02:15:50.64
couple words, maybe get you on the path and don't forget that we have a YouTube channel.

1456
02:15:50.64 --> 02:15:55.36
Yeah, if you want to know now, you can see. If you want to know, I was going to say or I was saying

1457
02:15:55.36 --> 02:16:00.80
if you want to see what Christy looks like. Hey, before before you check and see what Christy looks like.

1458
02:16:00.80 --> 02:16:07.04
Now, first you should go and see where's that picture posted of you with your freaking face.

1459
02:16:07.04 --> 02:16:12.40
It's on Instagram and Facebook. Ripped open. Yeah, I'm going to fit my face through the

1460
02:16:12.40 --> 02:16:16.72
lower right side of my face. You can see tea is that teeth you can see in there. You can see like white

1461
02:16:16.72 --> 02:16:20.80
stuff. It's too little teeth. Like my jaw was shattered and just unhinged so it's just

1462
02:16:20.80 --> 02:16:25.04
kind of like hanging there. Is it the kind of picture on Instagram and the kind where it's like

1463
02:16:25.04 --> 02:16:29.60
blurred out with the eyeball with the cross over it where you got to click properly. You know,

1464
02:16:29.60 --> 02:16:35.28
I would guess it is. I don't think so. I don't think so. I bet if you repost it, if you repost it,

1465
02:16:35.28 --> 02:16:40.64
you'll be like they'll they'll tell what's that called blurred out. Like a sensor for approval.

1466
02:16:40.64 --> 02:16:45.84
Something. Yeah. Dang. Do it. Well, yeah. Then now you can see what you currently

1467
02:16:45.84 --> 02:16:50.80
looks like in black and white by the way, but you're just saying you know, in black and white. It's available on the YouTube channel.

1468
02:16:52.72 --> 02:16:57.12
When people meet me, they go, oh, you're in color. That's what I think they say and you know,

1469
02:16:57.12 --> 02:17:02.000
let's say, say to me, you're shorter than I thought you would do. I get it all the time,

1470
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:09.12
do you? I'm 5. 11 and they're like, oh, you're not as tall. Well, I shouldn't say everyone says that to me,

1471
02:17:09.12 --> 02:17:14.72
but like I would say 10% of people. See, you know, 5% of people say, say, you're not shorter than I

1472
02:17:14.72 --> 02:17:18.88
thought you were going to be. And I say, oh, cool. They said it about you too. I will. That's that's

1473
02:17:18.88 --> 02:17:27.20
interesting because you know what people tell me? You're way bigger than me. That's for obvious reasons.

1474
02:17:28.08 --> 02:17:33.84

feedback that I'm getting. Quite a bit. So you may want to judge for yourself, Mikey and the dragons.

1495
02:19:45.04 --> 02:19:52.56
training interactive online. EF online dot com. We got the master coming up in Sydney, Australia.

1496
02:19:52.56 --> 02:19:58.40
By the way, have you been, Australia? I have. Did you love Australia? I love it. Where were you

1497
02:19:58.40 --> 02:20:08.24
in Australia? I went to Brisee, too. I was, it was so awesome. I loved it. It was so awesome.

1498
02:20:08.80 --> 02:20:14.08
And so we're doing a big event down there and definitely looking forward to it's in Sydney. It's

1499
02:20:14.08 --> 02:20:18.24
December, fourth and fifth. Here's the thing. Some people think, oh, it's not going to sell out.

1500
02:20:18.24 --> 02:20:23.60
If you're thinking that, you're not correct. You're not correct because every event that we've

1501
02:20:23.60 --> 02:20:27.84
done has sold out. Some people have said, well, are you going to go to Brisbane? Are you going to go to

1502
02:20:27.84 --> 02:20:34.96
Perth? The answer is no. We are not a rock band on tour. We're not hitting every city in Australia.

1503
02:20:34.96 --> 02:20:39.28
We're not, we're not hitting every city in America. We're doing, we do one or two. This is probably,

1504
02:20:39.28 --> 02:20:47.52
we probably won't go back to Australia for five years. That's one of my guess is right now. We

1505
02:20:47.52 --> 02:20:52.08
probably won't go back to Australia for five years because we'll do Europe, then we'll do Asia.

1506
02:20:52.08 --> 02:20:57.92
So, like you see what I'm saying. So if you're, if you're in Australia or you're New Zealand

1507
02:20:57.92 --> 02:21:03.92
or you're somewhere in that area of the world and you want to come to a monster, come to the one

1508
02:21:03.92 --> 02:21:08.88
that is taking place December, fourth and fifth. We also have a year of Overwatch for

1509
02:21:10.80 --> 02:21:17.04
veterans that are looking to be placed into companies that need leadership. Go to EF

1510
02:21:17.04 --> 02:21:26.96
Overwatch.com and on top of all that, if you just feel like you haven't gotten enough right now,

1511
02:21:26.96 --> 02:21:31.04
you haven't gotten enough of me. If you hadn't gotten enough of Echo, you haven't gotten enough of

1512
02:21:31.04 --> 02:21:38.80
Kirstie yet. Cool. This conversation will continue on the social media into webs on Twitter,

1513
02:21:38.80 --> 02:21:50.16
on Instagram and on that. Kirstie is first of all Kirstie NSfoundation.org and.com.

1514
02:21:52.56 --> 02:22:03.44
Kirstie Instagram, Kirstie underscore NS Twitter, Kirstie NS and it's KIRST. IE and then NS

1515
02:22:03.44 --> 02:22:11.68
KIRST. And Echo is Atacle Charles and I am at Jockel Willink. Echo, do you have anything else?

1516
02:22:11.68 --> 02:22:14.72
No, sir. No, ma'am. Good to see you. Good to meet you.

1517
02:22:14.72 --> 02:22:19.36
Like, why does things for having me? Kirstie, any closing thoughts for you?

1518
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.40
Yeah. I mean, I just want people to realize that me climbing all of these big,

1519
02:22:24.40 --> 02:22:28.56
you know, ridiculous mountains all over the world. It's more than it just being about me.

1520
02:22:28.56 --> 02:22:32.80
You know, I'm doing it for the people that need to hope, you know, somebody that needs inspiration

1521
02:22:32.80 --> 02:22:37.28
or even just the non-believers really waiting for me to prove them wrong. And even more,

1522
02:22:37.28 --> 02:22:41.60
so like I'm doing this with heart and passion and purpose. And you know, even for example,

1523
02:22:41.60 --> 02:22:48.64
like when I was out and Everest, I mean, in my organization helped establish the first ever wheelchair

1524
02:22:48.64 --> 02:22:53.92
program over in Nepal for 25 APT orphans. You know, when we were just down on Ecuador, we actually had

1525
02:22:53.92 --> 02:22:58.80
seven amputees standing on top of Kota Paxi. So, you know, this really is, it's just about

1526
02:22:58.80 --> 02:23:03.84
paying it forward and helping, you know, get the adaptive community into the outdoors and hopefully

1527
02:23:03.84 --> 02:23:08.08
encouraging, you know, other people regardless of whatever you're adversity that you're facing,

1528
02:23:08.08 --> 02:23:12.08
you know, to go outside and, you know, and find what really sets your heart on fire.

1529
02:23:12.88 --> 02:23:18.000
It's been a legit honor to sit down with you to meet with you. And I definitely,

1530
02:23:18.88 --> 02:23:23.68
absolutely thank you for coming on the show. I know it's a scary time commitment.

1531
02:23:23.68 --> 02:23:28.40
Especially when I tell you it's got my beef, you know, we've done podcasts that are four or five

1532
02:23:28.40 --> 02:23:33.60
hours long, but so it's awesome. And it's awesome for me to have the opportunity to share your

1533
02:23:33.60 --> 02:23:39.28
story and it's honored to be able to do that. So thank you for coming on. More important than that,

1534
02:23:39.28 --> 02:23:46.08
thank you for your service and your sacrifice and the Marine Corps. On top of that, thank you for

1535
02:23:46.08 --> 02:23:51.84
your continued service today with what you're doing with your foundation. And on top of that,

1536
02:23:51.84 --> 02:24:01.76
but what you do every day to show the rest of us the path and set an example for for everybody.

1537
02:24:02.72 --> 02:24:05.36
So thank you for all that and the rest of the service members out there.

1538
02:24:06.40 --> 02:24:10.88
Worldwide, currently serving or who have served.

1539
02:24:12.56 --> 02:24:17.92
Thank you for your service and your sacrifice and thanks for keeping us free and here at home to our

1540
02:24:17.92 --> 02:24:23.92
police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,

1541
02:24:23.92 --> 02:24:27.04
board of patrol, secret service. All the first responders that there are,

1542
02:24:28.88 --> 02:24:35.20
thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and to everyone else out there.

1543
02:24:38.48 --> 02:24:47.68
We all suffer losses. We all are going to have highs and lows in our

1544
02:24:47.68 --> 02:24:56.40
lives. We can all be petrified of what the future may hold and we can all have set backs and doubts

1545
02:24:56.40 --> 02:25:07.12
and pain. That's what's going to happen in life. But if you can look at someone like

1546
02:25:07.12 --> 02:25:16.80
Christy and you can follow her lead and you fight for it and you work for it and you work through it.

1547
02:25:16.80 --> 02:25:22.72
Those losses and those setbacks and that pain will make you better.

1548
02:25:25.92 --> 02:25:29.44
So as Christy said, appreciate the days.

1549
02:25:29.44 --> 02:25:39.60
Every day, then get on the path and stay on the path by getting out there and getting after it.

1550
02:25:39.60 --> 02:26:04.08
And until next time, this is Christy and us and echo and jocco out.
