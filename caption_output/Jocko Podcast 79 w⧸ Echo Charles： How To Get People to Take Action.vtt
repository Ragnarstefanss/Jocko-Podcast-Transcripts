00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 79.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And it has been a little while since we were able to hammer out some Q&A.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Sure, questions from the interwebs.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And so, here we are.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Number 79, let's answer some questions from the interwebs.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What do you got?

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Cool, go.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
First question.

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Jockel, wait.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.76
Should we spend a bunch of time with a bunch of fluff and talk about nonsense or should we get

14
00:00:34.76 --> 00:00:35.76
to the questions?

15
00:00:35.76 --> 00:00:40.48
What about 27 minutes worth of advertisements?

16
00:00:40.48 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's get to the questions.

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Rock and roll.

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I am a vascular surgeon training resident.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How do you apply decentralized command when your team changes every one to three months?

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Yeah, solid question.

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.56
And with something like that, what we need to do is we need to get an standard operating

22
00:00:59.56 --> 00:01:05.16
procedure in place with clear documentation, some kind of a qualification and approval

23
00:01:05.16 --> 00:01:09.000
process and then a monitoring system in place.

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.60
So the reason I can kind of, the reason that's pretty easy transition from you to make mentally

25
00:01:14.60 --> 00:01:19.28
is because we would have to do this kind of thing sometimes in the sealed teams.

26
00:01:19.28 --> 00:01:24.84
When you get, for instance, your overseas on deployment in a war zone and you get some

27
00:01:24.84 --> 00:01:30.24
guys that show up to work halfway through the deployment or two months into deployment or

28
00:01:30.24 --> 00:01:32.08
three weeks before deployment ends.

29
00:01:32.08 --> 00:01:35.32
You get some guys that show up their seals, right?

30
00:01:35.32 --> 00:01:39.24
So they, they, they, they understand the fundamental concepts, but you haven't worked with

31
00:01:39.24 --> 00:01:41.24
them specifically before.

32
00:01:41.24 --> 00:01:43.44
They haven't worked with the platoon before.

33
00:01:43.44 --> 00:01:46.72
They don't know the area of operations that you're in specifically.

34
00:01:46.72 --> 00:01:50.12
They don't know what kind of mission specifically you're conducting and where the intel is

35
00:01:50.12 --> 00:01:51.12
coming from.

36
00:01:51.12 --> 00:01:56.92
They don't know anything other than the fundamental knowledge of being a seal.

37
00:01:56.92 --> 00:01:59.40
But as far as that particular job goes, they don't know too much.

38
00:01:59.40 --> 00:02:05.72
So what you have to do is you have to run them through a bunch of familiarization stuff

39
00:02:05.72 --> 00:02:09.36
very quickly about the gun trucks and how your home visa set up.

40
00:02:09.36 --> 00:02:13.28
You've got to make sure that you can get on a 50 count on a Mark 48 and a Mark 19 and

41
00:02:13.28 --> 00:02:17.56
understand our cruiser of weapons and how we operate them because our cruiser of weapons

42
00:02:17.56 --> 00:02:22.04
by the way, a lot of times we most of the time operate our cruiser of weapons alone.

43
00:02:22.04 --> 00:02:24.76
So they got to make sure they can do this humvies, right?

44
00:02:24.76 --> 00:02:28.36
A lot of the older guys and the sealed themes before the war started, they wouldn't know

45
00:02:28.36 --> 00:02:29.76
how to operate a humvie.

46
00:02:29.76 --> 00:02:31.12
So you had to make sure they knew how to do that.

47
00:02:31.12 --> 00:02:32.44
They had to understand the mission.

48
00:02:32.44 --> 00:02:33.44
Why we were doing the mission?

49
00:02:33.44 --> 00:02:34.44
What was important about it?

50
00:02:34.44 --> 00:02:35.44
What was the commander's intent?

51
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:38.44
They had to know the rules of engagement.

52
00:02:38.44 --> 00:02:40.88
Because the military will take a guy that lands in country and they'll give him like

53
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:45.20
a 30 minute brief to welcome it in country and 30 seconds of it will be a rules of engagement

54
00:02:45.20 --> 00:02:47.44
brief and they won't really understand it.

55
00:02:47.44 --> 00:02:48.84
So you got to make sure they understand that.

56
00:02:48.84 --> 00:02:52.000
You got to win the last time they did med training, medical training.

57
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.72
Wends the last time they did that has been like 12 years since they put on a turn of

58
00:02:54.72 --> 00:02:55.72
kit.

59
00:02:55.72 --> 00:02:56.72
Okay, not good.

60
00:02:56.72 --> 00:02:58.16
We got to get him from the U.S. on that.

61
00:02:58.16 --> 00:03:01.80
How they're going to stop the bleeding, the different ID threats that are out there because

62
00:03:01.80 --> 00:03:03.44
the ID threats change all the time.

63
00:03:03.44 --> 00:03:07.12
What kind of trigger mechanisms are being used and what kind of identifying marks are for

64
00:03:07.12 --> 00:03:08.12
ID.

65
00:03:08.12 --> 00:03:09.12
So it's all this stuff.

66
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:13.16
The list goes on and on and so you have to develop some kind of a standard operating procedure.

67
00:03:13.16 --> 00:03:15.40
Hey, when a guy shows up, this is what we need to do with them.

68
00:03:15.40 --> 00:03:17.08
Boom, they need to go through this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

69
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:23.80
this little checklist you put together and then if the person's a leader, maybe you

70
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:28.20
got to go and do a couple of left seat rights, he rides with them.

71
00:03:28.20 --> 00:03:31.36
So does that make did, did, did do other people use that terminology, left seat rights

72
00:03:31.36 --> 00:03:32.36
it?

73
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:33.36
Not that I know.

74
00:03:33.36 --> 00:03:39.32
Okay, so if I was the Patoon Commander and you were coming in to take over for me,

75
00:03:39.32 --> 00:03:42.84
we would plan a mission together and I would be in charge of the mission.

76
00:03:42.84 --> 00:03:44.32
So I'd be in the driver's seat.

77
00:03:44.32 --> 00:03:45.84
Oh, like a pilot copilot.

78
00:03:45.84 --> 00:03:46.84
Yes.

79
00:03:46.84 --> 00:03:51.04
So you'd be watching and you'd be in the passenger seat and I would be running everything

80
00:03:51.04 --> 00:03:55.20
and then maybe we do that a couple times and you're just watching me and then we switch

81
00:03:55.20 --> 00:03:58.16
seats, you get the driver's seats, but I'm still there watching and telling you to move

82
00:03:58.16 --> 00:04:01.24
a little left, to move a little right and then eventually you got it and then I'm going

83
00:04:01.24 --> 00:04:02.48
to leave, go on.

84
00:04:02.48 --> 00:04:03.48
So yeah.

85
00:04:03.48 --> 00:04:06.28
So maybe if the person's a leader, you got to do two or three or four options or whatever

86
00:04:06.28 --> 00:04:08.72
to get them a good turnover.

87
00:04:08.72 --> 00:04:14.76
So now in all these situations or if it's not a full on turnover because that you're going to

88
00:04:14.76 --> 00:04:19.80
walk away from, but if it's just a, you've got some other group, small entity or people

89
00:04:19.80 --> 00:04:25.20
that are coming in, you're not going to be able to give them that full 100% decentralized

90
00:04:25.20 --> 00:04:26.44
command, right?

91
00:04:26.44 --> 00:04:31.52
You're still going to have to keep a little bit more watch on them because you're not

92
00:04:31.52 --> 00:04:35.84
going to build up the full level of trusts and one to three months, that's just not possible.

93
00:04:35.84 --> 00:04:44.72
So there will be a little bit of limitations, but you can definitely, you can definitely

94
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:48.88
move pretty far down the path and one other thing that's going to help, I said document

95
00:04:48.88 --> 00:04:58.52
and it's very smart to put together a document with very clear roles and responsibilities

96
00:04:58.52 --> 00:05:02.76
and expectation and then not just give them the document and say hey, read this letter.

97
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:06.20
No, no, no, you sit down and go over every single thing with them.

98
00:05:06.20 --> 00:05:09.56
So what you're trying to do is you're trying to condense this timeline of building trust

99
00:05:09.56 --> 00:05:13.80
into the shortest possible time and one of the ways you do that is by condensing everything

100
00:05:13.80 --> 00:05:18.64
into a simple clear concise format, written format, go through, talk it with them so they

101
00:05:18.64 --> 00:05:21.12
understand it and get to do it very clearly.

102
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:25.04
When I was in task in a bruiser, I didn't lay anything like that out for the platoon commanders,

103
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:29.76
for life and the adult platoon commander and say, here's the brawls and I did that over

104
00:05:29.76 --> 00:05:33.72
a long period of time, over a year work up now that, now within a few months, they kind

105
00:05:33.72 --> 00:05:38.12
of knew what the deal was, but if I would have, if that would have been my normal job

106
00:05:38.12 --> 00:05:41.84
and I would have been getting a new platoon commanders every three months, every time they

107
00:05:41.84 --> 00:05:43.40
came in, I'll be like, are you a new platoon commander?

108
00:05:43.40 --> 00:05:44.44
So this is what a platoon commander does.

109
00:05:44.44 --> 00:05:47.20
This is the rules and rules and responsibilities.

110
00:05:47.20 --> 00:05:50.72
This is the expectations that I have for you.

111
00:05:50.72 --> 00:05:54.08
This is when you call me, this is when you make a decision on your own, lay all that stuff

112
00:05:54.08 --> 00:05:59.36
perfectly clear and that way I could more quickly develop a sense of decentralized command.

113
00:05:59.36 --> 00:06:02.84
Now again, it's not going to be full decentralized command.

114
00:06:02.84 --> 00:06:04.24
You're not going to lose a lot of money, run with it.

115
00:06:04.24 --> 00:06:08.32
They've only been to you for three months and, you know, I don't know what the timeline

116
00:06:08.32 --> 00:06:13.60
is to, for a vascular surgeon to get total trust in their subordinate vascular surgeons or

117
00:06:13.60 --> 00:06:19.60
their subordinate team members, but I'm sure it takes longer than one to three months.

118
00:06:19.60 --> 00:06:21.88
So how much can you condense the timeline?

119
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:23.28
What can you do to condense it?

120
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:25.28
Why don't you get a condense as much as you can?

121
00:06:25.28 --> 00:06:29.80
You're still going to have to do a little bit more monitoring than you would normally do.

122
00:06:29.80 --> 00:06:31.60
But it is still going to be beneficial.

123
00:06:31.60 --> 00:06:36.20
It's going to be beneficial for them and it will be beneficial for you to operate as much

124
00:06:36.20 --> 00:06:40.44
as you can in the decentralized methodology.

125
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:44.08
So when you say condense the timeline, that's for the procedure.

126
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:47.36
No, it's condense the timeline to build trust.

127
00:06:47.36 --> 00:06:48.36
Oh, actually.

128
00:06:48.36 --> 00:06:51.56
So I want to, decentralized command is about trust, right?

129
00:06:51.56 --> 00:06:54.92
If I trust you and you trust me, it goes up and down.

130
00:06:54.92 --> 00:06:58.28
If I'm in charge and I trust you, that means you're going to go out and you know what to

131
00:06:58.28 --> 00:06:59.28
do.

132
00:06:59.28 --> 00:07:03.56
And when you're out there, you know you trust that I am going to cover for you and I'm

133
00:07:03.56 --> 00:07:05.32
going to trust the decisions that you make.

134
00:07:05.32 --> 00:07:07.56
So decentralized command is about trust.

135
00:07:07.56 --> 00:07:10.56
In order to have trust, we have to have understanding.

136
00:07:10.56 --> 00:07:13.20
And in order to understand things, we have to work together.

137
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:17.20
So what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to condense the timeline that it takes us to build

138
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:18.20
trust.

139
00:07:18.20 --> 00:07:19.20
And how do I do that?

140
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:22.36
I just have been very direct and lay things out in a very simple clear concise format

141
00:07:22.36 --> 00:07:23.96
so that you can understand it.

142
00:07:23.96 --> 00:07:24.96
Gotcha.

143
00:07:24.96 --> 00:07:25.96
Very quickly.

144
00:07:25.96 --> 00:07:26.96
That's my goal.

145
00:07:26.96 --> 00:07:27.96
Makes sense.

146
00:07:27.96 --> 00:07:31.68
Next question.

147
00:07:31.68 --> 00:07:36.84
Then and how is the right way to skip the chain of command when you feel like your direct

148
00:07:36.84 --> 00:07:40.96
superior is a part of the problem.

149
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:42.44
Big one.

150
00:07:42.44 --> 00:07:52.68
Big one because this is very, very problematic and skipping the chain of command is a last

151
00:07:52.68 --> 00:07:55.20
resort.

152
00:07:55.20 --> 00:07:56.20
It is a last resort.

153
00:07:56.20 --> 00:07:57.20
Why is it a last resort?

154
00:07:57.20 --> 00:08:00.000
Because when you skip the chain of command, you're breaking the trust I just talked about

155
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.20
your breaking it.

156
00:08:01.20 --> 00:08:05.12
The relationship that you've been building, you're damaging it.

157
00:08:05.12 --> 00:08:06.12
It's not good.

158
00:08:06.12 --> 00:08:08.92
Sometimes it's un-salvigible, by the way.

159
00:08:08.92 --> 00:08:12.12
Sometimes when you skip the chain of command, you will never be able to recover from

160
00:08:12.12 --> 00:08:13.12
that.

161
00:08:13.12 --> 00:08:18.04
Now, of course, if there's something that your media spirit is doing, that's illegal or

162
00:08:18.04 --> 00:08:26.12
immoral or unethical, if that's the case, then it's actually your duty to go above them in

163
00:08:26.12 --> 00:08:27.12
the chain of command.

164
00:08:27.12 --> 00:08:30.56
Now, do you still first report it to them and say, hey, what you did is wrong, we're not

165
00:08:30.56 --> 00:08:31.56
going to do that.

166
00:08:31.56 --> 00:08:35.88
Yes, you should tell them first unless it's going to cause you to get in some horrible

167
00:08:35.88 --> 00:08:37.28
situation.

168
00:08:37.28 --> 00:08:41.12
Now, this is an interesting thing that I thought about.

169
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:46.52
Let's say you and I are working together and you're my boss.

170
00:08:46.52 --> 00:08:53.12
And you let's say you're doing something that's immoral, illegal, unethical, right?

171
00:08:53.12 --> 00:08:55.64
And I watch you do it.

172
00:08:55.64 --> 00:08:57.12
And I see you leaning towards it.

173
00:08:57.12 --> 00:09:00.28
I'm like, oh, I think he's going to do something that's illegal right here.

174
00:09:00.28 --> 00:09:01.96
And I don't want to say anything.

175
00:09:01.96 --> 00:09:03.80
And then I watch you do it.

176
00:09:03.80 --> 00:09:05.12
And then I run up the chain of command report.

177
00:09:05.12 --> 00:09:08.36
You can bust you, right?

178
00:09:08.36 --> 00:09:10.36
You got to be careful with that.

179
00:09:10.36 --> 00:09:17.96
And I think when you work for someone or when someone works for you, you need to lay it right

180
00:09:17.96 --> 00:09:19.20
out of the gate.

181
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:21.16
Hey, this is where I stand.

182
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:27.64
I'm not going to cover for you if you do some stupid illegal things.

183
00:09:27.64 --> 00:09:32.36
You don't wait for them to do it and then drop the hammer on them.

184
00:09:32.36 --> 00:09:34.000
Maybe I'm being overly fair.

185
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.36
Maybe we should be all out to get people that are doing something that they shouldn't

186
00:09:39.36 --> 00:09:40.76
be doing part of the problem.

187
00:09:40.76 --> 00:09:46.24
Yeah, I believe that's my belief.

188
00:09:46.24 --> 00:09:49.000
When I meet you and I say, hey, what's going on?

189
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.56
And you make a little crack.

190
00:09:51.56 --> 00:09:53.84
You make a little joke.

191
00:09:53.84 --> 00:09:55.92
You say, well, you know, it's not like the business.

192
00:09:55.92 --> 00:09:59.96
Like the customers can really see that money.

193
00:09:59.96 --> 00:10:01.36
You know, let's say you're going to skin money.

194
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:02.36
So, right, right?

195
00:10:02.36 --> 00:10:03.36
Yeah, that's what you got.

196
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:05.64
And you make a little joke like that.

197
00:10:05.64 --> 00:10:08.08
And what you're doing is testing the waters with me.

198
00:10:08.08 --> 00:10:10.24
You're testing my ethical moral stuff.

199
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:12.44
And I'm going to say, yeah, there's no way they would ever know.

200
00:10:12.44 --> 00:10:15.24
And besides, we pretty much work for it anyways, right?

201
00:10:15.24 --> 00:10:17.44
You're going to see if you're going to get that reaction.

202
00:10:17.44 --> 00:10:20.52
So, you know, we just, you know, sometimes we get to get a little charge of the

203
00:10:20.52 --> 00:10:22.16
lexter on that install, right?

204
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:25.16
Maybe we're maybe we're some kind of installers at a house.

205
00:10:25.16 --> 00:10:28.60
Yeah, you know, I usually throw a little up charge on here.

206
00:10:28.60 --> 00:10:32.60
They never know if that's type of wall, whatever, right?

207
00:10:32.60 --> 00:10:34.08
You throw that test at me.

208
00:10:34.08 --> 00:10:35.56
It's my duty.

209
00:10:35.56 --> 00:10:39.68
If I'm the type of person that's going to report you for scimming money from the

210
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:43.52
customers, then I should tell you like, man, that's not going to go, no.

211
00:10:43.52 --> 00:10:44.52
Yeah.

212
00:10:44.52 --> 00:10:46.52
No, those customers, you know, here's my view.

213
00:10:46.52 --> 00:10:49.72
Is those customers that we're out there trying to do this install for?

214
00:10:49.72 --> 00:10:52.64
They had to work hard for that money and I don't want to be taken up from them.

215
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:54.04
Now you kind of know.

216
00:10:54.04 --> 00:10:56.84
You better not be doing that in front of me.

217
00:10:56.84 --> 00:11:01.16
As opposed to me smiling and going along with your joke, and then three months later,

218
00:11:01.16 --> 00:11:05.08
I report, you know, I turn over report to the boss man.

219
00:11:05.08 --> 00:11:06.08
Yeah.

220
00:11:06.08 --> 00:11:07.92
So, I don't think that's very ethical evil.

221
00:11:07.92 --> 00:11:09.64
Yeah, it's kind of like a mislead you.

222
00:11:09.64 --> 00:11:11.64
It's a little bit of a backstab.

223
00:11:11.64 --> 00:11:12.64
Yeah.

224
00:11:12.64 --> 00:11:14.04
Now, are there cases?

225
00:11:14.04 --> 00:11:17.96
Of course, where somebody's doing something that's just outrageously unethical and you

226
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:20.24
didn't know about it or something?

227
00:11:20.24 --> 00:11:21.24
You pretty much know, though.

228
00:11:21.24 --> 00:11:23.44
You can tell when people are doing shady things.

229
00:11:23.44 --> 00:11:24.44
Yeah.

230
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:27.88
So, so I think that that is something, okay.

231
00:11:27.88 --> 00:11:33.48
So let me, let me, let me close this thought or at least make a point of this thought.

232
00:11:33.48 --> 00:11:36.84
My point of this thought is it's the same thing that happens a lot when people don't like

233
00:11:36.84 --> 00:11:39.04
to have hard conversations.

234
00:11:39.04 --> 00:11:44.32
So it's an easy conversation when you say, you know, those customers never know where

235
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:48.56
their money goes and it's only 12 bucks of thing and it's no big deal.

236
00:11:48.56 --> 00:11:53.12
The easiest thing for me to do is to smile and say, yeah.

237
00:11:53.12 --> 00:11:54.12
Right.

238
00:11:54.12 --> 00:11:55.12
That's the easiest.

239
00:11:55.12 --> 00:11:57.12
And that's not that big of a deal.

240
00:11:57.12 --> 00:11:58.12
Right.

241
00:11:58.12 --> 00:11:59.12
It gets so much harder.

242
00:11:59.12 --> 00:12:03.72
The further we go down that road, it gets harder and harder and harder because then

243
00:12:03.72 --> 00:12:07.68
you start saying, hey, you know, it's only, you know, we've been to gaming like 12 bucks.

244
00:12:07.68 --> 00:12:08.68
Guess what?

245
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:14.12
They never notice this other charge either and I can get them for $62.

246
00:12:14.12 --> 00:12:16.28
And then all of a sudden it's a harder conversation.

247
00:12:16.28 --> 00:12:18.60
So have the hard conversation earlier.

248
00:12:18.60 --> 00:12:22.92
It'll make it easier for you.

249
00:12:22.92 --> 00:12:31.36
So that being said, now how do we escalate above you and the chain of command?

250
00:12:31.36 --> 00:12:33.88
First of all, my goal is to not escalate above you and the chain of command.

251
00:12:33.88 --> 00:12:38.76
My goal is to actually raise the situation to you and bring it up to you and say, hey,

252
00:12:38.76 --> 00:12:42.36
echo, you know, the way we've been doing this job, you know, I think we should do it

253
00:12:42.36 --> 00:12:43.36
a different way.

254
00:12:43.36 --> 00:12:46.64
I think there's a better way to treat the customer whatever the thing is, better way

255
00:12:46.64 --> 00:12:48.68
to attack this target, whatever the thing is.

256
00:12:48.68 --> 00:12:50.24
And I'm going to have that conversation with you.

257
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:55.28
I'm going to make two, three, four, five times to try and get you to listen to me.

258
00:12:55.28 --> 00:12:58.64
Now, if the conversation doesn't work, I'm going to escalate it even further.

259
00:12:58.64 --> 00:12:59.64
You know what I'm going to do?

260
00:12:59.64 --> 00:13:02.28
I'm going to actually do a little right up on the right of point paper.

261
00:13:02.28 --> 00:13:05.44
I'm going to say, echo, I was listening to thinking about what we're doing, how we're

262
00:13:05.44 --> 00:13:09.48
hitting this target or how we're loading out our guys or whatever.

263
00:13:09.48 --> 00:13:10.48
And I'm going to write you a point paper.

264
00:13:10.48 --> 00:13:15.60
I'm going to lay it out for you to land what my plan is, what the cost benefits are,

265
00:13:15.60 --> 00:13:18.48
and make that very clear to you.

266
00:13:18.48 --> 00:13:25.24
So that way, I'm giving you every ample opportunity to listen to what I'm saying.

267
00:13:25.24 --> 00:13:31.16
And I'm probably even going to say, hey, maybe we should run this by the boss to see what

268
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:32.16
they think.

269
00:13:32.16 --> 00:13:35.04
Because if you just keep disagreeing with me and I say, you know, could I, you might

270
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:37.88
if I bring this to the boss and see what he thinks?

271
00:13:37.88 --> 00:13:39.64
Now what are you going to say to that?

272
00:13:39.64 --> 00:13:43.56
Most of the media are not going to be happy, but I'm giving you a heads up, because I'm

273
00:13:43.56 --> 00:13:45.80
just trying to play open.

274
00:13:45.80 --> 00:13:48.76
And it kind of doesn't it kind of make them reflect too?

275
00:13:48.76 --> 00:13:51.76
It's like, hey, I'm going to, you know, bring some by their will.

276
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:53.68
One of them say, no, don't bring that to the boss.

277
00:13:53.68 --> 00:13:57.72
It's kind of like, it makes it real overt that they're not doing crap.

278
00:13:57.72 --> 00:13:58.72
Yeah.

279
00:13:58.72 --> 00:14:03.92
So, yeah, you say, and you might get a boss, you might get a boss, because yeah, bring

280
00:14:03.92 --> 00:14:04.92
it to him.

281
00:14:04.92 --> 00:14:05.92
He's going to say the same thing.

282
00:14:05.92 --> 00:14:06.92
I'm telling you.

283
00:14:06.92 --> 00:14:07.92
And then you go, maybe I'm wrong.

284
00:14:07.92 --> 00:14:09.52
Yeah, I'm wrong about this procedure.

285
00:14:09.52 --> 00:14:12.04
Or maybe I'm wrong about how we're going to attack this target.

286
00:14:12.04 --> 00:14:16.80
But it is, and also this is a hard conversation to have.

287
00:14:16.80 --> 00:14:20.56
The hard conversation says someone, man, can we just bring this to the boss or?

288
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:25.36
And again, I'm not saying, you say, I'm going to bring this to the boss.

289
00:14:25.36 --> 00:14:28.36
No, you say, hey, would you mind if I got his opinion?

290
00:14:28.36 --> 00:14:31.88
Would you mind if I see what she said about this?

291
00:14:31.88 --> 00:14:36.76
And that way, we're not saying, I'm going to the boss.

292
00:14:36.76 --> 00:14:37.92
So, I'm going to love your head.

293
00:14:37.92 --> 00:14:38.92
You can't stop me.

294
00:14:38.92 --> 00:14:40.68
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

295
00:14:40.68 --> 00:14:43.52
So, there's that.

296
00:14:43.52 --> 00:14:48.16
The other thing that you can, so that's sort of a direct approach with your media boss,

297
00:14:48.16 --> 00:14:50.76
which starts by the way with an indirect approach, being like, hey, I go.

298
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:52.48
You know, it's not the way we're hitting these targets.

299
00:14:52.48 --> 00:14:53.48
Wouldn't it be smart?

300
00:14:53.48 --> 00:14:55.80
Maybe if we hit him from over here, do you think that would work?

301
00:14:55.80 --> 00:14:57.08
And now we're just open up the conversation.

302
00:14:57.08 --> 00:14:58.08
So we've done that.

303
00:14:58.08 --> 00:15:00.92
I can also go indirect with your boss, right?

304
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:05.44
So your direct boss, who is now two up above me and the chain of credit, I can go indirect

305
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:07.32
with him at the water fountain.

306
00:15:07.32 --> 00:15:08.32
Right?

307
00:15:08.32 --> 00:15:09.32
Yeah.

308
00:15:09.32 --> 00:15:10.96
Hey, oh, yeah.

309
00:15:10.96 --> 00:15:11.44
Thanks, Paul.

310
00:15:11.44 --> 00:15:12.44
See everything's going great.

311
00:15:12.44 --> 00:15:13.44
Yeah, doing a great job.

312
00:15:13.44 --> 00:15:14.72
Yeah, I'm on Ecos team.

313
00:15:14.72 --> 00:15:16.64
Yeah, yeah, no, it's really good.

314
00:15:16.64 --> 00:15:17.64
It's good.

315
00:15:17.64 --> 00:15:18.64
It's a tough mission.

316
00:15:18.64 --> 00:15:20.24
But, you know, we're always exploring new ways to do it.

317
00:15:20.24 --> 00:15:21.88
You know, we're looking at some other ops.

318
00:15:21.88 --> 00:15:25.36
I was thinking of on another way to hit those targets too, kind of like coming in from this

319
00:15:25.36 --> 00:15:26.36
direction.

320
00:15:26.36 --> 00:15:27.36
Oh.

321
00:15:27.36 --> 00:15:30.08
That's why I did was just drop a little, plant a little seeds, you know?

322
00:15:30.08 --> 00:15:33.28
I have that conversation come up and I'm just going to, that's what I'm going to do.

323
00:15:33.28 --> 00:15:37.80
Plant a little seeds and try and get them to maybe.

324
00:15:37.80 --> 00:15:39.88
I don't know, sounds like a really good idea.

325
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:40.88
What did Echo think of that?

326
00:15:40.88 --> 00:15:45.28
I, you know, actually, I haven't talked to Echo about it in full detail, but I will.

327
00:15:45.28 --> 00:15:50.16
Not going to have any name in that boss asked me about this and he was mentioned, you

328
00:15:50.16 --> 00:15:53.36
know, I mentioned this other way of doing it and he thought it might be a good idea and I just

329
00:15:53.36 --> 00:15:55.56
want to give you heads up in case he says anything.

330
00:15:55.56 --> 00:15:57.60
I didn't really have a chance, you know, whatever.

331
00:15:57.60 --> 00:15:59.96
So we're just playing the game a little bit.

332
00:15:59.96 --> 00:16:00.96
That's good.

333
00:16:00.96 --> 00:16:01.96
That's good.

334
00:16:01.96 --> 00:16:04.32
That line, I just want to give you the heads up.

335
00:16:04.32 --> 00:16:07.44
I feel like that's like real good when someone says it.

336
00:16:07.44 --> 00:16:14.20
It is, however, it also gets, it's also a way of saying, hey, I rounded you out.

337
00:16:14.20 --> 00:16:16.20
I ratted you out.

338
00:16:16.20 --> 00:16:20.16
Depending on what it's followed with, it's like, hey, I just want to give you heads up.

339
00:16:20.16 --> 00:16:23.88
The boss, you know, asked me about this and I didn't know how to respond.

340
00:16:23.88 --> 00:16:26.08
So I said this and he was coming talk to you.

341
00:16:26.08 --> 00:16:27.68
I just wanted to give you heads up.

342
00:16:27.68 --> 00:16:28.68
That's different.

343
00:16:28.68 --> 00:16:30.88
I just to give you heads up, I talked to the boss earlier today.

344
00:16:30.88 --> 00:16:32.16
I told him what your deal is.

345
00:16:32.16 --> 00:16:34.16
It's kind of like that.

346
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:36.16
That's not a good for you.

347
00:16:36.16 --> 00:16:39.68
So yeah, there's all kinds of shade to gray there as well.

348
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:42.40
And you know, I worked for for a while.

349
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:43.68
I was the Admiral's aide.

350
00:16:43.68 --> 00:16:50.48
And so I worked for a really great guy, great Admiral, who I had a really good relationship

351
00:16:50.48 --> 00:16:51.92
with, you know.

352
00:16:51.92 --> 00:16:55.88
And if I needed something, he was going to give it to me.

353
00:16:55.88 --> 00:16:59.88
And so when I was a tasking to commander, which is what job I went to immediately when I

354
00:16:59.88 --> 00:17:08.64
got done working for the Admiral, I literally had a direct line to the Admiral because I had

355
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:10.48
his cell phone number.

356
00:17:10.48 --> 00:17:12.12
I had his office number.

357
00:17:12.12 --> 00:17:18.12
And if I wanted to call him, he wanted to talk to me because we were friends.

358
00:17:18.12 --> 00:17:22.12
But that doesn't mean that I went to him and you know, did all kinds of, you know, I

359
00:17:22.12 --> 00:17:23.12
didn't do that.

360
00:17:23.12 --> 00:17:26.40
No, I never took advantage of that at all.

361
00:17:26.40 --> 00:17:28.52
And was always professional.

362
00:17:28.52 --> 00:17:35.92
But there is this little story where it's odd as this might sound where you're getting

363
00:17:35.92 --> 00:17:38.20
ready to go into plumbing.

364
00:17:38.20 --> 00:17:43.40
And we needed a, what's called a large format color printer.

365
00:17:43.40 --> 00:17:48.40
And it prints out big pieces of paper, large format.

366
00:17:48.40 --> 00:17:50.32
And you need it because you need to make battle maps.

367
00:17:50.32 --> 00:17:54.12
And you need a good one because when you are in an operation every single guy in the

368
00:17:54.12 --> 00:18:00.000
Patuna as a map, so you could have, you might need 810, 1215, 30.

369
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.76
You might need 30 color laminated maps to go out on the mission.

370
00:18:04.76 --> 00:18:06.32
And for whatever reason, I think we had one.

371
00:18:06.32 --> 00:18:08.64
It was kind of crappy.

372
00:18:08.64 --> 00:18:13.000
And the boss, the Admiral, you know, I talked to him before I was going on a plumbing.

373
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.36
I don't know if he called me or I ran into him or whatever.

374
00:18:16.36 --> 00:18:17.80
And he's the Admiral and charge everything.

375
00:18:17.80 --> 00:18:19.60
And he's just, you know, getting a feel for what's going on.

376
00:18:19.60 --> 00:18:23.40
And he says, you know, hey, you have everything you need for the plumbing because he

377
00:18:23.40 --> 00:18:26.76
knew I was leaving in a couple of days or a couple of weeks.

378
00:18:26.76 --> 00:18:28.84
And I said, yeah, you know, sir, we're, we're good to go.

379
00:18:28.84 --> 00:18:31.92
You know, I'm only, right now, believing that I'm just waiting on a printer.

380
00:18:31.92 --> 00:18:35.20
You've got to get one of his large format printers for battle maps, but I, that were,

381
00:18:35.20 --> 00:18:38.20
we're rocking and rolling.

382
00:18:38.20 --> 00:18:45.20
And like that afternoon, I got back to my office and the Commodore.

383
00:18:45.20 --> 00:18:50.14
So now it's two bosses above my immediate boss at the Seal team and one guy below the

384
00:18:50.14 --> 00:18:51.14
Admiral.

385
00:18:51.14 --> 00:18:53.26
We don't have like a message for me.

386
00:18:53.26 --> 00:18:56.14
He was like, hey, and luckily I was friends with him.

387
00:18:56.14 --> 00:18:58.78
He was a, I guess you need a printer.

388
00:18:58.78 --> 00:19:01.18
Let me know what kind of things were you.

389
00:19:01.18 --> 00:19:02.58
He's like, thanks for the heads up.

390
00:19:02.58 --> 00:19:03.78
And I was like, hey, sorry, sir.

391
00:19:03.78 --> 00:19:06.58
I just saw him in the Quiky Mart or whatever.

392
00:19:06.58 --> 00:19:10.98
But yeah, you know, you, you got to, you got to, you don't want to abuse that stuff at

393
00:19:10.98 --> 00:19:11.98
all.

394
00:19:11.98 --> 00:19:15.38
And you got to get to be smart about it.

395
00:19:15.38 --> 00:19:19.42
And it's always, as I'm telling you, it's always, it's, it's not good to skip the chain

396
00:19:19.42 --> 00:19:20.42
of command.

397
00:19:20.42 --> 00:19:23.70
It's not going to, it generally is not going to benefit you.

398
00:19:23.70 --> 00:19:25.78
It generally going to put you in a bad situation.

399
00:19:25.78 --> 00:19:29.34
It's going to give you less leverage with your immediate boss.

400
00:19:29.34 --> 00:19:35.46
Because if I went above the chain command on you, even with you get redirected by our

401
00:19:35.46 --> 00:19:37.66
boss, you are pissed.

402
00:19:37.66 --> 00:19:38.90
Yeah.

403
00:19:38.90 --> 00:19:41.42
And you're going to, you're going to sabotage.

404
00:19:41.42 --> 00:19:44.74
Yeah, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, really, it's a version of going behind

405
00:19:44.74 --> 00:19:45.74
someone's back.

406
00:19:45.74 --> 00:19:46.74
Oh, for sure.

407
00:19:46.74 --> 00:19:47.74
It is.

408
00:19:47.74 --> 00:19:50.38
And it almost even feels like, even if you tell them, it's,

409
00:19:50.38 --> 00:19:52.22
it feels like, oh, you're going to pop my hand.

410
00:19:52.22 --> 00:19:53.22
Yeah, it's going to be behind that.

411
00:19:53.22 --> 00:19:57.02
It's a, it's a really, it's a tough one.

412
00:19:57.02 --> 00:19:59.74
You got to, you got to use caution with that one.

413
00:19:59.74 --> 00:20:02.50
And also, I'll tell you what else it is.

414
00:20:02.50 --> 00:20:08.38
It's, it's an easy, it's, it appears to be the easy way out.

415
00:20:08.38 --> 00:20:11.02
Like, if you're not listening to me, I'm going to go above the chain of command.

416
00:20:11.02 --> 00:20:16.78
Instead of me influencing you, explaining to you, writing point papers to you, building a

417
00:20:16.78 --> 00:20:18.58
relationship with you so that you trust me.

418
00:20:18.58 --> 00:20:22.34
Instead of doing all those things that take time and effort intact, I'm just going to skip

419
00:20:22.34 --> 00:20:23.62
the chain of command until your boss.

420
00:20:23.62 --> 00:20:26.30
That's, that's another negative about it.

421
00:20:26.30 --> 00:20:27.30
It's a cop out.

422
00:20:27.30 --> 00:20:28.82
You shouldn't need to do it.

423
00:20:28.82 --> 00:20:31.90
I can't, like that printer story I just told.

424
00:20:31.90 --> 00:20:35.74
Like, other than that, I'll be going above the chain of command.

425
00:20:35.74 --> 00:20:37.02
And that was almost a comical thing.

426
00:20:37.02 --> 00:20:41.90
Like I said, I was friends with the comador too, who always took great care of me and was laughing

427
00:20:41.90 --> 00:20:42.90
when he left the message.

428
00:20:42.90 --> 00:20:44.10
I go, thanks for the heads up.

429
00:20:44.10 --> 00:20:45.58
You know, he wasn't mad when he said that.

430
00:20:45.58 --> 00:20:48.50
He was, you know, he was laughing because here I was getting ready to play

431
00:20:48.50 --> 00:20:50.74
to Iraq and what I want is a printer.

432
00:20:50.74 --> 00:20:55.22
That's what we need, which can tell you how dialed in we were and how much great gear

433
00:20:55.22 --> 00:20:58.18
we had because the only thing that was left that we needed was a printer.

434
00:20:58.18 --> 00:20:59.54
You know, that's what I was at.

435
00:20:59.54 --> 00:21:02.38
I got all the, everything we needed, but I needed a printer.

436
00:21:02.38 --> 00:21:04.42
So you went above his head and I get it.

437
00:21:04.42 --> 00:21:05.42
Yeah.

438
00:21:05.42 --> 00:21:09.74
But you got to, you know, other than that, it's really hard for me to think of other times

439
00:21:09.74 --> 00:21:13.58
in my naval career where I went above someone in the chain of command.

440
00:21:13.58 --> 00:21:14.58
It just didn't happen.

441
00:21:14.58 --> 00:21:17.38
You know, I'm going to take the time to build a relationship with my immediate boss and

442
00:21:17.38 --> 00:21:18.86
they're going to do what I want them to do.

443
00:21:18.86 --> 00:21:20.86
They're going to give me what I want them to give me.

444
00:21:20.86 --> 00:21:23.46
They're going to support me the way I need to get supported.

445
00:21:23.46 --> 00:21:25.30
That's what I'm going to do.

446
00:21:25.30 --> 00:21:27.46
That's leading up the chain of command.

447
00:21:27.46 --> 00:21:29.86
Skipping the chain of command isn't really leadership.

448
00:21:29.86 --> 00:21:30.86
So try not to do it.

449
00:21:30.86 --> 00:21:35.30
Kind of like when you're kid in your, you got to deal with your older brother or something,

450
00:21:35.30 --> 00:21:38.30
but instead of dealing with him, you go and tattle on him or something like that.

451
00:21:38.30 --> 00:21:39.30
Yeah.

452
00:21:39.30 --> 00:21:40.30
I feel.

453
00:21:40.30 --> 00:21:42.86
Yeah, no, it's the same similar thing.

454
00:21:42.86 --> 00:21:44.86
Not that my little brother tattled on me ever.

455
00:21:44.86 --> 00:21:46.66
And it's like, yeah.

456
00:21:46.66 --> 00:21:51.22
Interesting how you, and it seems like this is the common theme to how you're, uh, like

457
00:21:51.22 --> 00:21:55.98
you want to try the most and the best you can to deal with it yourself, like the

458
00:21:55.98 --> 00:21:56.98
most for sure.

459
00:21:56.98 --> 00:21:57.98
Like from the beginning.

460
00:21:57.98 --> 00:21:58.98
Oh, I don't know.

461
00:21:58.98 --> 00:22:01.78
I mean, just like how you were saying how like if you got to fire someone, you

462
00:22:01.78 --> 00:22:05.02
know, where you want to get to the point where you're dealing with it in the beginning.

463
00:22:05.02 --> 00:22:06.02
Yes.

464
00:22:06.02 --> 00:22:08.54
Like you can't like just let them do the wrong thing.

465
00:22:08.54 --> 00:22:09.90
You be like, yeah, that's cool.

466
00:22:09.90 --> 00:22:11.06
Let them do it for years.

467
00:22:11.06 --> 00:22:13.66
And then be like, you know what, you're fired because of all these wrong things.

468
00:22:13.66 --> 00:22:14.66
You didn't even bring it.

469
00:22:14.66 --> 00:22:19.62
Think about this too, like on the on ethical things, you, you might be, again, I'm going

470
00:22:19.62 --> 00:22:25.46
to walk a fine line here, but you might not recognize.

471
00:22:25.46 --> 00:22:27.86
You might not recognize that what you're doing is on ethical.

472
00:22:27.86 --> 00:22:31.26
You might be like, hey, jocco, you know what I do is I just, I always hit everyone with

473
00:22:31.26 --> 00:22:36.30
this little extra $12 charge, you know, no big deal, no one ever notices it.

474
00:22:36.30 --> 00:22:37.78
And, you know, we're working hard.

475
00:22:37.78 --> 00:22:43.14
And you might just, hey, man, it gives you food for your kids and you're working on a bunch

476
00:22:43.14 --> 00:22:46.78
of rich people's houses, so they can afford 12 bucks.

477
00:22:46.78 --> 00:22:47.78
And it's not that big of a deal to you.

478
00:22:47.78 --> 00:22:50.06
And maybe somebody that you started working for did the same thing.

479
00:22:50.06 --> 00:22:52.06
And that's kind of just a standard operating procedure.

480
00:22:52.06 --> 00:22:54.06
Where's the house like, man, you know what?

481
00:22:54.06 --> 00:22:58.94
That's not good, you know, that's actually, it might not seem like a big deal, but you're

482
00:22:58.94 --> 00:22:59.94
taking money.

483
00:22:59.94 --> 00:23:03.66
You know, you know, like, put money on your table, give you feed your kids and take

484
00:23:03.66 --> 00:23:07.46
money off their table, you know, and whether they're rich or not, money is money.

485
00:23:07.46 --> 00:23:10.22
And I don't think, I don't feel like we should be doing it.

486
00:23:10.22 --> 00:23:14.66
You know what I mean, I can might awaken you and get your ethics back on track and you

487
00:23:14.66 --> 00:23:17.78
might be a good dude because so just because someone was skimming some money doesn't mean

488
00:23:17.78 --> 00:23:19.50
they're horrible person, right?

489
00:23:19.50 --> 00:23:22.74
It means that they went down the wrong path.

490
00:23:22.74 --> 00:23:25.82
It just because someone goes down the wrong path doesn't mean they can come back.

491
00:23:25.82 --> 00:23:28.38
They doesn't mean they cannot come back to the right path.

492
00:23:28.38 --> 00:23:33.26
Man, if I was, if I was, you know, executed every time I did something that was stupid

493
00:23:33.26 --> 00:23:36.06
or bad or, you know, I shouldn't have done.

494
00:23:36.06 --> 00:23:38.94
I would die a thousand deaths by now, right?

495
00:23:38.94 --> 00:23:41.14
We grow up and we learn these things.

496
00:23:41.14 --> 00:23:43.70
We become better people, but we only become better people.

497
00:23:43.70 --> 00:23:44.70
We only learn these things.

498
00:23:44.70 --> 00:23:46.02
If somebody teaches them to us, yeah.

499
00:23:46.02 --> 00:23:50.66
Now we can learn the hard way, which is, you know, all the sudden someone looks at you

500
00:23:50.66 --> 00:23:51.66
and goes away.

501
00:23:51.66 --> 00:23:52.66
What's this charge for 12 bucks?

502
00:23:52.66 --> 00:23:55.26
And then they pull up all your receipts for the last five years you've been working

503
00:23:55.26 --> 00:23:56.26
here.

504
00:23:56.26 --> 00:23:58.34
And then they realize you've stolen money from the company and stolen money from these

505
00:23:58.34 --> 00:24:03.50
customers and they're going to prosecute you because stealing over X amount of dollars

506
00:24:03.50 --> 00:24:04.50
is a felony.

507
00:24:04.50 --> 00:24:05.50
You know what I mean?

508
00:24:05.50 --> 00:24:08.50
So then you learn your lesson, but that's not the lesson we want to learn.

509
00:24:08.50 --> 00:24:12.74
So having those tough conversations like you're talking about having them upfront and

510
00:24:12.74 --> 00:24:16.62
whether it's your, rewrite, whether it's counseling somebody, whether it's dealing with, you

511
00:24:16.62 --> 00:24:21.70
know, my boss, who I want to tell, like, hey, I think there's a better way to do this.

512
00:24:21.70 --> 00:24:25.62
Any of those, the earlier you do them, the easier they are to have.

513
00:24:25.62 --> 00:24:29.50
And the longer you wait to do them, the harder they get.

514
00:24:29.50 --> 00:24:30.50
Yeah.

515
00:24:30.50 --> 00:24:34.62
So also to it's just an overall help.

516
00:24:34.62 --> 00:24:38.74
Like, I don't know, it's hard to not draw the analogy, not the analogy, but the comparison

517
00:24:38.74 --> 00:24:45.26
between like your boss and subordinates type situation and parenting kids, you know, like

518
00:24:45.26 --> 00:24:46.46
for sure.

519
00:24:46.46 --> 00:24:50.38
Just like are you saying sometimes people don't know necessarily that it's unethical or they

520
00:24:50.38 --> 00:24:52.26
don't know what's that unethical or something like that.

521
00:24:52.26 --> 00:24:53.26
That's that's it.

522
00:24:53.26 --> 00:24:55.82
I mean, in my situation with kids, like they don't know.

523
00:24:55.82 --> 00:24:58.06
Essentially, they don't know better, you know?

524
00:24:58.06 --> 00:24:59.06
Like, I don't know.

525
00:24:59.06 --> 00:25:01.86
You take a permanent pen and you draw all over the walls.

526
00:25:01.86 --> 00:25:03.34
You're four or five years old.

527
00:25:03.34 --> 00:25:07.14
And you're like, yeah, sure, I've been drawing on paper this whole time.

528
00:25:07.14 --> 00:25:11.02
So there's no reason for me to think sure I should draw on the walls, but there's really

529
00:25:11.02 --> 00:25:12.58
nothing to tell me not to do.

530
00:25:12.58 --> 00:25:13.58
So they do it.

531
00:25:13.58 --> 00:25:16.02
And then they go get like beat or something.

532
00:25:16.02 --> 00:25:18.90
That or just yell that or something, something, something, some punishment.

533
00:25:18.90 --> 00:25:20.06
Straight up punishment.

534
00:25:20.06 --> 00:25:22.30
Instead of, you know, okay, you didn't know that.

535
00:25:22.30 --> 00:25:23.30
You have to know this.

536
00:25:23.30 --> 00:25:24.58
You know, it's like that kind of stuff.

537
00:25:24.58 --> 00:25:26.86
Bro, I got to, I got to tell the story.

538
00:25:26.86 --> 00:25:29.94
We were, I was going through Officer Canada at school.

539
00:25:29.94 --> 00:25:32.10
And there's a manual and you're going through Officer Canada at school.

540
00:25:32.10 --> 00:25:33.10
I can't remember what it's.

541
00:25:33.10 --> 00:25:34.78
All the rules of Officer Canada is going.

542
00:25:34.78 --> 00:25:37.58
Everything you, this, our uniform supposed to be, this is the way you're locked, supposed

543
00:25:37.58 --> 00:25:38.58
to be.

544
00:25:38.58 --> 00:25:41.50
These are the way you stand, line it, the chow hall, all the, every single rule is in this

545
00:25:41.50 --> 00:25:42.50
book.

546
00:25:42.50 --> 00:25:43.50
And I figured what it's called.

547
00:25:43.50 --> 00:25:45.22
So you live by the code of this book.

548
00:25:45.22 --> 00:25:47.70
And it's very specific rules.

549
00:25:47.70 --> 00:25:53.70
And there was a kid who was going through Officer Canada at school with us.

550
00:25:53.70 --> 00:25:57.58
And he was from another country.

551
00:25:57.58 --> 00:26:00.74
He'd been raised into the country and became an American citizen.

552
00:26:00.74 --> 00:26:05.30
And he was from another country and grew up in a really poor, you know, a really poor

553
00:26:05.30 --> 00:26:06.30
kid.

554
00:26:06.30 --> 00:26:07.30
So good for him.

555
00:26:07.30 --> 00:26:10.02
I mean, he had achieved incredible amount of finishing college going to Officer

556
00:26:10.02 --> 00:26:11.02
Canada at school.

557
00:26:11.02 --> 00:26:12.02
It was awesome.

558
00:26:12.02 --> 00:26:17.70
But he had some habits from growing up in the third world that were a little bit different

559
00:26:17.70 --> 00:26:21.06
for, you know, for Americans.

560
00:26:21.06 --> 00:26:26.06
And one of the things that he would do is he would urinate in the shower.

561
00:26:26.06 --> 00:26:29.70
And not just while he was taking a shower, but when you come back from a class or something,

562
00:26:29.70 --> 00:26:33.06
you know, you'd everyone have to go to the bathroom at the same time.

563
00:26:33.06 --> 00:26:36.66
And so, you know, guys would go in and he filled up the urinals and then there's nowhere

564
00:26:36.66 --> 00:26:37.66
to piss.

565
00:26:37.66 --> 00:26:38.66
So what are you going to do?

566
00:26:38.66 --> 00:26:40.18
Oh, he would just go in the shower and it's a big open shower.

567
00:26:40.18 --> 00:26:42.02
He'd just go in there and piss right in the drain like it was nothing.

568
00:26:42.02 --> 00:26:43.02
Toylet, show.

569
00:26:43.02 --> 00:26:44.02
Yeah, show or whatever.

570
00:26:44.02 --> 00:26:48.26
And one of the American kids, and I'm calling kids.

571
00:26:48.26 --> 00:26:52.26
These guys are all, you know, actually we had a, but some of them were new kids fresh out

572
00:26:52.26 --> 00:26:53.26
of college.

573
00:26:53.26 --> 00:26:57.66
The kid, the kid that was urinating in the shower was fresh out of college.

574
00:26:57.66 --> 00:27:01.58
And one of the older guys who was like me was a prioron listed guy, he came to me and

575
00:27:01.58 --> 00:27:05.38
he said, hey, man, this kid's urinating in the shower.

576
00:27:05.38 --> 00:27:07.38
Like all the time.

577
00:27:07.38 --> 00:27:10.14
And I said, I said, okay, we know, run the water.

578
00:27:10.14 --> 00:27:13.54
He's like, man, I gotta get the, he's like, I've, you know, my squads and charge to cleaning

579
00:27:13.54 --> 00:27:14.54
the showers.

580
00:27:14.54 --> 00:27:17.74
And so these are my guys on the ground, cleaning up his piss.

581
00:27:17.74 --> 00:27:19.02
Is it in cool?

582
00:27:19.02 --> 00:27:20.02
And I was like, all right, cool.

583
00:27:20.02 --> 00:27:21.18
I'll talk to him.

584
00:27:21.18 --> 00:27:25.90
So I went, I said, hey, man, that's a, you know, officer candidate, whatever, can I talk

585
00:27:25.90 --> 00:27:26.90
to you for a second?

586
00:27:26.90 --> 00:27:27.90
He goes, yeah, and he comes in my room.

587
00:27:27.90 --> 00:27:32.30
As a guy, man, you, you know, you're, you're, you're pissing in the shower, just wait

588
00:27:32.30 --> 00:27:33.98
for a toilet.

589
00:27:33.98 --> 00:27:36.82
And he looked at me like I was telling him that he shouldn't breathe air.

590
00:27:36.82 --> 00:27:37.82
Right?

591
00:27:37.82 --> 00:27:39.18
He was like, well, why?

592
00:27:39.18 --> 00:27:42.78
And I said, I said, we'll know because, you know, you're, you're pissing where everyone

593
00:27:42.78 --> 00:27:45.54
walks around and, and he goes, yeah, but they'll water to drain.

594
00:27:45.54 --> 00:27:46.78
It's just all the pipes.

595
00:27:46.78 --> 00:27:51.54
And he goes, and I said, no, it's, it's not, just, just don't do it.

596
00:27:51.54 --> 00:27:53.14
And he goes, it's not in the rule book.

597
00:27:53.14 --> 00:27:54.14
It's what he said to me.

598
00:27:54.14 --> 00:27:55.14
And I go, what do you mean?

599
00:27:55.14 --> 00:27:56.14
The, the, the, the name, the manual.

600
00:27:56.14 --> 00:27:58.70
He goes, it doesn't say in there that you can't piss in the showers.

601
00:27:58.70 --> 00:28:00.70
I was like, well, doesn't say you get piss on my floor.

602
00:28:00.70 --> 00:28:03.06
I don't, or my bed, but I don't want you doing that.

603
00:28:03.06 --> 00:28:04.06
But it was interesting.

604
00:28:04.06 --> 00:28:08.70
My point is that his viewpoint was like, this was totally normal.

605
00:28:08.70 --> 00:28:11.42
And he, and he was a great kid and it's hard worker.

606
00:28:11.42 --> 00:28:13.26
But for him, he was just like, what are you talking about?

607
00:28:13.26 --> 00:28:14.58
Why wouldn't I piss in the shower?

608
00:28:14.58 --> 00:28:16.22
All the, all the pissers are taken.

609
00:28:16.22 --> 00:28:17.58
I'm going to go piss in the shower.

610
00:28:17.58 --> 00:28:18.58
Well, next question.

611
00:28:18.58 --> 00:28:19.58
Let's move on.

612
00:28:19.58 --> 00:28:20.58
I got work to do.

613
00:28:20.58 --> 00:28:25.10
And so I had to explain to him, hey, man, listen, it's, it's a little different.

614
00:28:25.10 --> 00:28:27.82
And people that are cleaning the showers don't want to be,

615
00:28:27.82 --> 00:28:30.46
they're on their hands and he's in, in your piss.

616
00:28:30.46 --> 00:28:33.74
Yeah. So he said, okay, and he, he listened to me.

617
00:28:33.74 --> 00:28:34.58
Mm-hm.

618
00:28:34.58 --> 00:28:37.30
And, but I could see that he listened to me, but he didn't,

619
00:28:37.30 --> 00:28:38.42
100% agree with me.

620
00:28:38.42 --> 00:28:39.42
Right.

621
00:28:39.42 --> 00:28:42.50
He was like, okay, you know, he, he kind of did that, you know?

622
00:28:42.50 --> 00:28:45.18
And it was one of those, where I, I'm trying to explain to him the why,

623
00:28:45.18 --> 00:28:49.38
but it just, it's like you're saying, he literally didn't understand

624
00:28:49.38 --> 00:28:54.66
that that was not acceptable from a hygienic point, hygienic.

625
00:28:54.66 --> 00:28:56.02
Is that right? hygienic.

626
00:28:56.02 --> 00:29:01.66
hygienic from a hygienic point from a, you know, a moral, or a morale point of the,

627
00:29:04.10 --> 00:29:04.66
Oh, yeah.

628
00:29:04.66 --> 00:29:06.10
The morale, they're cleaning up.

629
00:29:06.10 --> 00:29:06.94
So yeah.

630
00:29:06.94 --> 00:29:08.46
That was, that was good times.

631
00:29:08.46 --> 00:29:11.94
You know, we've seen that, um, sign felt, you watch sign felt there.

632
00:29:11.94 --> 00:29:12.86
You know what that is, right?

633
00:29:12.86 --> 00:29:13.54
I know it's not a sign.

634
00:29:13.54 --> 00:29:14.58
I know it's not a sign.

635
00:29:14.58 --> 00:29:15.78
That's what they talk about.

636
00:29:15.78 --> 00:29:16.58
Yeah.

637
00:29:16.58 --> 00:29:17.74
It gets caught.

638
00:29:17.74 --> 00:29:21.54
When they guys get caught, taking a leak in the shower at the gym.

639
00:29:21.54 --> 00:29:23.26
You know, the gym takes shower.

640
00:29:23.26 --> 00:29:27.06
And then it's like, you know, they catch you and they, you're ostracized.

641
00:29:27.06 --> 00:29:31.78
Basically, I think Dave and took his man out of no, but he was like, hey, you

642
00:29:31.78 --> 00:29:35.34
believe this, there, whatever, you know, they're, they're mad at me for, you know, pissing

643
00:29:35.34 --> 00:29:36.34
in the shower at the gym.

644
00:29:36.34 --> 00:29:40.66
And he's like, why, why are you confused that they're mad at you, kind of thing?

645
00:29:40.66 --> 00:29:42.06
And he's like, it's all pipes.

646
00:29:42.06 --> 00:29:43.06
It's a little grueling.

647
00:29:43.06 --> 00:29:44.34
You know, he's trying to defend it.

648
00:29:44.34 --> 00:29:48.82
And you can kind of see where in a small team, tiny way, if you don't think about it.

649
00:29:48.82 --> 00:29:49.82
Yeah.

650
00:29:49.82 --> 00:29:50.82
Why not?

651
00:29:50.82 --> 00:29:51.82
It's going down the drain.

652
00:29:51.82 --> 00:29:52.82
You're not pissing on the, on the people.

653
00:29:52.82 --> 00:29:55.06
Hey, I was deployed on a ship.

654
00:29:55.06 --> 00:29:56.26
And I was in off, there was an ensign.

655
00:29:56.26 --> 00:30:01.30
So I just moved up from the, from the troop birthing where I used to be with the elisted

656
00:30:01.30 --> 00:30:02.30
spine.

657
00:30:02.30 --> 00:30:03.86
So at least a proudly call ourselves.

658
00:30:03.86 --> 00:30:09.02
I was on, I was up in the, in the officer area in the, when they call those, they're

659
00:30:09.02 --> 00:30:10.02
the officer country.

660
00:30:10.02 --> 00:30:11.86
So they have a little signs, officer country.

661
00:30:11.86 --> 00:30:13.34
You know, no enlisted allowed.

662
00:30:13.34 --> 00:30:14.34
You lead us.

663
00:30:14.34 --> 00:30:15.34
Yeah, totally lead us.

664
00:30:15.34 --> 00:30:20.06
So I'm in there and I'm living with, we actually had four other seals, seal officers in

665
00:30:20.06 --> 00:30:21.06
this room.

666
00:30:21.06 --> 00:30:25.14
It won the seal officers that would sink in the room, but no bathroom.

667
00:30:25.14 --> 00:30:28.10
So you just had a sink, you brush your teeth, shave, whatever, but if you wanted the

668
00:30:28.10 --> 00:30:31.70
bathroom, you could go down the hallway where the showers and the pissers were.

669
00:30:31.70 --> 00:30:37.94
And so one night, I'm, you know, I'm like, get stirred awake by some noise.

670
00:30:37.94 --> 00:30:44.10
And I see one of my fellow officers is pissing in the sink, right, in the sink.

671
00:30:44.10 --> 00:30:48.38
And, you know, I, I was like, hey man, what are you doing?

672
00:30:48.38 --> 00:30:52.70
He's like, oh my walkin' all the way to the, down to the bathroom.

673
00:30:52.70 --> 00:30:55.06
I was like, yeah, yeah, actually, yes, you are.

674
00:30:55.06 --> 00:30:57.06
That's why I brushed my teeth.

675
00:30:57.06 --> 00:30:58.06
Holmes.

676
00:30:58.06 --> 00:30:59.78
And he, and he was the same way.

677
00:30:59.78 --> 00:31:02.26
He was kind of surprised, like, what's wrong with you?

678
00:31:02.26 --> 00:31:03.26
Yeah.

679
00:31:03.26 --> 00:31:06.22
It's just piss and it's the same pipes, but like, no, do me a favor.

680
00:31:06.22 --> 00:31:07.58
Just walk on down there.

681
00:31:07.58 --> 00:31:13.90
What if he, you're in a didn't sink regularly, but every single time when he was done,

682
00:31:13.90 --> 00:31:16.86
he scrubbed the sink with like, light-hawn stuff.

683
00:31:16.86 --> 00:31:19.22
It's all psychological on that one.

684
00:31:19.22 --> 00:31:22.14
Well, it's not just psychological, but that doesn't even make it worth it.

685
00:31:22.14 --> 00:31:23.62
Now, you might as well walk down there.

686
00:31:23.62 --> 00:31:26.42
Right, I, I dig it, but like, what if that was just his thing?

687
00:31:26.42 --> 00:31:28.38
I mean, well, how would you feel about it?

688
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:29.50
Don't piss in my sink.

689
00:31:29.50 --> 00:31:30.50
Yeah, right?

690
00:31:30.50 --> 00:31:35.22
It's like, it's like a, what do you call like, customary almost, for reasons, of course.

691
00:31:35.22 --> 00:31:36.94
Yeah, the reasons don't piss you by sink.

692
00:31:36.94 --> 00:31:38.46
You gotta think about it.

693
00:31:38.46 --> 00:31:42.98
Actually in college, we play football and we did like a nice facility too at UH,

694
00:31:42.98 --> 00:31:46.14
but the showers were like guys who do it all the time.

695
00:31:46.14 --> 00:31:51.14
And, but the showers were shaped different where, like, let's say you're facing the shower,

696
00:31:51.14 --> 00:31:52.14
right?

697
00:31:52.14 --> 00:31:54.06
Or you're facing the wall.

698
00:31:54.06 --> 00:31:55.78
At the bottom of the wall was like a gutter.

699
00:31:55.78 --> 00:31:56.78
True, true.

700
00:31:56.78 --> 00:31:57.78
It trance.

701
00:31:57.78 --> 00:31:58.78
Yeah, so it went down.

702
00:31:58.78 --> 00:32:02.98
So if you did and one guy's would even go, you weren't ever standing in it.

703
00:32:02.98 --> 00:32:06.66
So if you're standing in it, that's like, obvious, you know?

704
00:32:06.66 --> 00:32:10.46
But guys who do it, and when I first saw it, I was like, dang, you're just openly doing

705
00:32:10.46 --> 00:32:11.46
it.

706
00:32:11.46 --> 00:32:14.82
Like, one of those guy actually mentions this name before I'm like, I mentioned because pissing

707
00:32:14.82 --> 00:32:19.94
shower, but he's like talking to me while he's pissing in the shower.

708
00:32:19.94 --> 00:32:21.58
Almost like it was a straight up toilet.

709
00:32:21.58 --> 00:32:22.58
It was like the same.

710
00:32:22.58 --> 00:32:26.50
He's like, yeah, I'll talk to him and I'm like, all right, that's how.

711
00:32:26.50 --> 00:32:30.90
So again, it's more like the ethics of the culture almost.

712
00:32:30.90 --> 00:32:31.90
It's what it seemed like.

713
00:32:31.90 --> 00:32:34.14
Yeah, what it seems like to me is don't piss in my sink.

714
00:32:34.14 --> 00:32:35.14
I agree.

715
00:32:35.14 --> 00:32:36.14
Oh, yeah, the sink is different.

716
00:32:36.14 --> 00:32:37.14
It doesn't go different.

717
00:32:37.14 --> 00:32:38.14
It's a different ball game.

718
00:32:38.14 --> 00:32:41.98
Yeah, shower, okay, understood, right?

719
00:32:41.98 --> 00:32:43.34
Like you said, it goes down the drain.

720
00:32:43.34 --> 00:32:45.94
And there's water flowing all over it.

721
00:32:45.94 --> 00:32:48.58
Yeah, you're washing off any washing off.

722
00:32:48.58 --> 00:32:51.14
There's soap coming over it, but you know what?

723
00:32:51.14 --> 00:32:55.86
I got a good idea, just as a general overall rule, pissing the toilet.

724
00:32:55.86 --> 00:32:56.86
Yeah, try the toilet.

725
00:32:56.86 --> 00:32:58.58
Yeah, so we better do that one.

726
00:32:58.58 --> 00:33:02.18
Yeah, the same way, and probably not going to brush your teeth in the toilet.

727
00:33:02.18 --> 00:33:03.18
Yeah, you wouldn't do that.

728
00:33:03.18 --> 00:33:07.06
But the sink is now, if you want to brush your teeth in the toilet, have that.

729
00:33:07.06 --> 00:33:08.06
I won't be mad at you.

730
00:33:08.06 --> 00:33:09.42
I'll be mad at you, bro.

731
00:33:09.42 --> 00:33:12.82
I don't know if I can hang out with you as much or whatever.

732
00:33:12.82 --> 00:33:14.46
But yeah, I understand.

733
00:33:14.46 --> 00:33:15.46
It makes sense.

734
00:33:15.46 --> 00:33:16.46
And it's going to bother you.

735
00:33:16.46 --> 00:33:17.46
It's going to bother you.

736
00:33:17.46 --> 00:33:18.86
I'm talking about skipping the chain of command.

737
00:33:18.86 --> 00:33:19.66
Oh, yeah, that's right.

738
00:33:19.66 --> 00:33:22.22
Because the guy at OCS, Austria-Canard, it's cool.

739
00:33:22.22 --> 00:33:23.46
Yeah, you've got his into the shower.

740
00:33:23.46 --> 00:33:24.46
Got a lot of them up.

741
00:33:24.46 --> 00:33:26.22
You've got to have the hard conversations.

742
00:33:26.22 --> 00:33:27.54
I wonder what happened to him.

743
00:33:27.54 --> 00:33:28.22
He was a hard boy.

744
00:33:28.22 --> 00:33:30.74
Where we see him?

745
00:33:30.74 --> 00:33:38.30
Somewhere like Vietnam, or Louser, something.

746
00:33:38.30 --> 00:33:40.18
Maybe Thailand.

747
00:33:40.18 --> 00:33:45.22
But some Asian, Asian country, Southeast Asian country, hard worker and smart.

748
00:33:45.22 --> 00:33:51.70
Yeah, I would say my opinion about taking a leaking shower is you shouldn't do it.

749
00:33:51.70 --> 00:33:56.58
But if like this guy who's like, oh, that's normal, that doesn't totally surprise me though.

750
00:33:56.58 --> 00:33:58.30
Yeah, no, it doesn't surprise me.

751
00:33:58.30 --> 00:34:00.10
But make sense that guys didn't like it though.

752
00:34:00.10 --> 00:34:01.10
For sure.

753
00:34:01.10 --> 00:34:04.10
Next question.

754
00:34:04.10 --> 00:34:07.10
And don't skip the chain of command if you can avoid it.

755
00:34:07.10 --> 00:34:10.90
Yeah, by the way, yeah, don't forget either.

756
00:34:10.90 --> 00:34:12.14
Yeah, that's it.

757
00:34:12.14 --> 00:34:15.82
Anything going behind someone's back, it just, like, how you say it, it's like, sometimes

758
00:34:15.82 --> 00:34:16.82
you can't repair that.

759
00:34:16.82 --> 00:34:18.82
Yeah, that's hard to repair.

760
00:34:18.82 --> 00:34:19.82
Oh, man.

761
00:34:19.82 --> 00:34:23.02
Hard to repair.

762
00:34:23.02 --> 00:34:24.02
Hello.

763
00:34:24.02 --> 00:34:29.42
How do you rank your longevity in your priorities?

764
00:34:29.42 --> 00:34:33.10
Long jeopardy, this is talking about staying alive for as long as possible.

765
00:34:33.10 --> 00:34:35.18
And of course, I mean, I want to live.

766
00:34:35.18 --> 00:34:36.66
Oh, like how to get revenge.

767
00:34:36.66 --> 00:34:40.02
Yeah, that how do I personally, that's the way it was quick.

768
00:34:40.02 --> 00:34:41.46
The question is actually directed at me.

769
00:34:41.46 --> 00:34:43.10
Jockel will in question for the podcast.

770
00:34:43.10 --> 00:34:45.54
How do you rank your longevity in your priorities?

771
00:34:45.54 --> 00:34:48.74
Long jeopardy being how long you're going to live for.

772
00:34:48.74 --> 00:34:54.26
And for me, I mean, obviously, long jeopardy has some level of importance.

773
00:34:54.26 --> 00:34:57.90
I do want to live for a little while longer.

774
00:34:57.90 --> 00:35:06.26
But and I think that generally my lifestyle and my focus on health and fitness in

775
00:35:06.26 --> 00:35:12.18
Broadway, align with living for a little longer.

776
00:35:12.18 --> 00:35:15.66
So, you know, working out and all that stuff is good.

777
00:35:15.66 --> 00:35:18.90
But there's also an extreme, and I don't know if you know this, I don't know how much

778
00:35:18.90 --> 00:35:22.90
you know about this, or if you've ever read about it, but there's an extreme side of

779
00:35:22.90 --> 00:35:30.78
longevity of trying, if you're goal in life was to live as long as possible, there's

780
00:35:30.78 --> 00:35:32.38
an extreme version of that.

781
00:35:32.38 --> 00:35:33.38
Do you know about this?

782
00:35:33.38 --> 00:35:34.38
I don't know.

783
00:35:34.38 --> 00:35:35.38
How so?

784
00:35:35.38 --> 00:35:40.14
One of the biggest things is you do calorie restriction.

785
00:35:40.14 --> 00:35:41.62
Massive calorie restriction.

786
00:35:41.62 --> 00:35:45.18
You're talking like massive calorie restriction.

787
00:35:45.18 --> 00:35:47.06
And that's one of them.

788
00:35:47.06 --> 00:35:52.82
And believe it or not, you do extremely low levels of physical activity.

789
00:35:52.82 --> 00:35:53.82
Right?

790
00:35:53.82 --> 00:36:00.70
You basically, if your goal was to live as long as possible, you would want to live basically

791
00:36:00.70 --> 00:36:02.74
in a bubble.

792
00:36:02.74 --> 00:36:04.30
And do nothing.

793
00:36:04.30 --> 00:36:09.58
But eat very little and just lay there.

794
00:36:09.58 --> 00:36:11.98
No, Gitu.

795
00:36:11.98 --> 00:36:13.62
And no surfing.

796
00:36:13.62 --> 00:36:14.90
No lifting heavy weights.

797
00:36:14.90 --> 00:36:16.26
None of that stuff.

798
00:36:16.26 --> 00:36:22.78
Now when you're in that mode of longevity, pure longevity, you are not prepared for anything

799
00:36:22.78 --> 00:36:24.34
in the actual world.

800
00:36:24.34 --> 00:36:25.34
Right?

801
00:36:25.34 --> 00:36:29.78
Because your heart can only beat so many times.

802
00:36:29.78 --> 00:36:35.70
And if the less you use it, the longer it's going to be lasting.

803
00:36:35.70 --> 00:36:37.70
But and I'm sure I have that not quite right.

804
00:36:37.70 --> 00:36:41.86
But the problem is if you're not in good shape when you get surprised, your heart can't

805
00:36:41.86 --> 00:36:42.86
handle.

806
00:36:42.86 --> 00:36:43.86
That's the kind of people that I've heard it.

807
00:36:43.86 --> 00:36:46.58
The heart can't handle all this madness when it comes.

808
00:36:46.58 --> 00:36:48.54
So I'm not going there.

809
00:36:48.54 --> 00:36:56.34
It's not worth it for me to live my whole life as a sedentary person half starved and completely

810
00:36:56.34 --> 00:37:00.50
unprepared for anything to happen to me outside of my bubble is not happening.

811
00:37:00.50 --> 00:37:03.22
I'm not going to live that way.

812
00:37:03.22 --> 00:37:05.22
So where does it rank in my priorities?

813
00:37:05.22 --> 00:37:07.86
I think it's an important thing.

814
00:37:07.86 --> 00:37:13.42
But I think my general lifestyle aligns with enough that I don't think about it as much.

815
00:37:13.42 --> 00:37:20.14
And I think overall living life is more important to me than just living.

816
00:37:20.14 --> 00:37:21.14
Yeah.

817
00:37:21.14 --> 00:37:24.06
So let's get a live life.

818
00:37:24.06 --> 00:37:31.06
But if magic, like a magic wizard guy says, I'm the gatekeeper of your whole life, whatever

819
00:37:31.06 --> 00:37:32.62
your life in this situation.

820
00:37:32.62 --> 00:37:33.62
He's a grim repurp.

821
00:37:33.62 --> 00:37:34.62
That's what he was.

822
00:37:34.62 --> 00:37:40.06
And he said, I know when you're going to die, you can't help it.

823
00:37:40.06 --> 00:37:43.14
I just know the future, whatever.

824
00:37:43.14 --> 00:37:47.34
I will give you 20 extra years.

825
00:37:47.34 --> 00:37:50.42
Right now, you're, you know, 40 something years old.

826
00:37:50.42 --> 00:37:53.34
The day you're going to die, whenever that is, I can't tell you that.

827
00:37:53.34 --> 00:37:55.38
Maybe 90, maybe 80, whatever.

828
00:37:55.38 --> 00:38:01.50
But I'll give you 20 more years of fully functional life.

829
00:38:01.50 --> 00:38:03.34
But you've got to stop things you did to right now.

830
00:38:03.34 --> 00:38:05.06
You can never do it ever again.

831
00:38:05.06 --> 00:38:07.62
I probably choke him out.

832
00:38:07.62 --> 00:38:08.62
Next question.

833
00:38:08.62 --> 00:38:10.74
But otherwise, you'd be just as functional.

834
00:38:10.74 --> 00:38:15.82
You can lift, you can surf, you can, you know, you can get after it in every other way.

835
00:38:15.82 --> 00:38:16.82
Just no Gigiitu.

836
00:38:16.82 --> 00:38:18.82
I know martial arts in anyway.

837
00:38:18.82 --> 00:38:19.82
Oh, you know what?

838
00:38:19.82 --> 00:38:22.58
I would double leg them.

839
00:38:22.58 --> 00:38:26.38
And then I would pass his guard and then I would choke him up.

840
00:38:26.38 --> 00:38:27.38
Yeah.

841
00:38:27.38 --> 00:38:28.38
Yeah.

842
00:38:28.38 --> 00:38:29.38
Makes sense.

843
00:38:29.38 --> 00:38:33.86
And I take his sickle and I'd free the world.

844
00:38:33.86 --> 00:38:36.82
So a Gigiitu free life is not life.

845
00:38:36.82 --> 00:38:39.58
That's what you're saying.

846
00:38:39.58 --> 00:38:44.02
I think the minute you start restraining yourself from doing things that you want to do,

847
00:38:44.02 --> 00:38:46.90
you need to take serious considerations in what you're doing.

848
00:38:46.90 --> 00:38:47.90
Yeah.

849
00:38:47.90 --> 00:38:52.14
I also think that hypothetical questions like that are completely ridiculous.

850
00:38:52.14 --> 00:38:53.14
No, they're not.

851
00:38:53.14 --> 00:38:54.74
They're mental exercise.

852
00:38:54.74 --> 00:38:56.14
So that's why.

853
00:38:56.14 --> 00:38:59.62
And then in that case, I will stay with my first answer.

854
00:38:59.62 --> 00:39:00.62
Yeah.

855
00:39:00.62 --> 00:39:01.62
I agree.

856
00:39:01.62 --> 00:39:04.62
If the grim reaper came to me and maybe an offer, I would double leg him.

857
00:39:04.62 --> 00:39:06.98
I would take him down and I would choke him out.

858
00:39:06.98 --> 00:39:07.98
There you go.

859
00:39:07.98 --> 00:39:08.98
I might kill him.

860
00:39:08.98 --> 00:39:09.98
Yeah.

861
00:39:09.98 --> 00:39:10.98
I might kill him.

862
00:39:10.98 --> 00:39:11.98
There you go.

863
00:39:11.98 --> 00:39:12.98
See?

864
00:39:12.98 --> 00:39:13.98
Boom.

865
00:39:13.98 --> 00:39:14.98
And you can't do that without you.

866
00:39:14.98 --> 00:39:15.98
Just do so.

867
00:39:15.98 --> 00:39:16.98
As far as the double leg and choking someone up.

868
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:21.62
So back to your, how you say, you know, the longevity thing.

869
00:39:21.62 --> 00:39:24.46
I didn't know about that actually.

870
00:39:24.46 --> 00:39:27.62
And it makes sense because that's a lot of things.

871
00:39:27.62 --> 00:39:31.18
Like if you want to be the safest you possibly can in life, right?

872
00:39:31.18 --> 00:39:32.18
Same thing.

873
00:39:32.18 --> 00:39:36.22
You're just going to live in a bubble with no threats of any disease, sterilized bubble,

874
00:39:36.22 --> 00:39:40.82
no murders, no car accidents, no nothing, never drive, never do anything.

875
00:39:40.82 --> 00:39:41.82
The same thing.

876
00:39:41.82 --> 00:39:42.82
You'll be so safe.

877
00:39:42.82 --> 00:39:44.38
You'll be the safest person in the world.

878
00:39:44.38 --> 00:39:45.38
Really.

879
00:39:45.38 --> 00:39:51.10
But as far as quote unquote, living life, you know, you go one day out in the wild.

880
00:39:51.10 --> 00:39:52.42
Oh, you're dead.

881
00:39:52.42 --> 00:39:53.42
Same thing.

882
00:39:53.42 --> 00:39:58.58
Like if you restrict all your calories, no hard physical activity, no son, you know,

883
00:39:58.58 --> 00:40:00.38
all this stuff.

884
00:40:00.38 --> 00:40:04.26
The moment you go to everyday life, which is physical in some, less, less, less

885
00:40:04.26 --> 00:40:05.26
way.

886
00:40:05.26 --> 00:40:06.26
Right.

887
00:40:06.26 --> 00:40:07.26
But still physical, they're son.

888
00:40:07.26 --> 00:40:08.26
There's, when you go out, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're

889
00:40:08.26 --> 00:40:09.26
son, right?

890
00:40:09.26 --> 00:40:10.26
So it's like all or nothing.

891
00:40:10.26 --> 00:40:11.26
Yeah.

892
00:40:11.26 --> 00:40:12.74
Take vitamin D pills.

893
00:40:12.74 --> 00:40:13.74
Yeah.

894
00:40:13.74 --> 00:40:17.10
The, the other thing is with calorie restriction is I think, and, you know, I'm reading

895
00:40:17.10 --> 00:40:18.42
about this stuff all the time.

896
00:40:18.42 --> 00:40:22.50
And, but you can get a lot of those benefits by doing some intermittent fast test

897
00:40:22.50 --> 00:40:23.50
for sure.

898
00:40:23.50 --> 00:40:24.50
Yeah.

899
00:40:24.50 --> 00:40:25.50
And you will feel good on the intermittent fasting.

900
00:40:25.50 --> 00:40:26.50
Yeah.

901
00:40:26.50 --> 00:40:28.86
24, 48, 72 hours.

902
00:40:28.86 --> 00:40:30.30
That's the most I've done.

903
00:40:30.30 --> 00:40:31.30
Say no.

904
00:40:31.30 --> 00:40:33.10
And maybe I'll do some more in the future.

905
00:40:33.10 --> 00:40:36.18
Tim Ferris did like seven days.

906
00:40:36.18 --> 00:40:37.18
Okay.

907
00:40:37.18 --> 00:40:40.82
Or actually, you know, I don't know, man.

908
00:40:40.82 --> 00:40:41.82
Yeah.

909
00:40:41.82 --> 00:40:42.82
Yeah.

910
00:40:42.82 --> 00:40:45.06
But and see, and that's, that almost goes into whole, honestly.

911
00:40:45.06 --> 00:40:48.38
When I did 72 hours, the last time I did it, I did the same thing.

912
00:40:48.38 --> 00:40:49.38
I've done it a couple times now.

913
00:40:49.38 --> 00:40:50.38
Every time I feel fine.

914
00:40:50.38 --> 00:40:51.38
Yeah.

915
00:40:51.38 --> 00:40:53.38
I don't feel any of this stuff that people talk about.

916
00:40:53.38 --> 00:40:54.38
Yeah.

917
00:40:54.38 --> 00:40:55.38
Well, yeah.

918
00:40:55.38 --> 00:40:58.38
So, no, I mean, it's, this is almost, you know, I feel hungry for a little while.

919
00:40:58.38 --> 00:40:59.38
Yeah.

920
00:40:59.38 --> 00:41:01.38
But I do, I wasn't like, oh God.

921
00:41:01.38 --> 00:41:02.38
Right.

922
00:41:02.38 --> 00:41:03.38
I wasn't going to die.

923
00:41:03.38 --> 00:41:04.38
No.

924
00:41:04.38 --> 00:41:05.38
Yeah, you were.

925
00:41:05.38 --> 00:41:06.38
No.

926
00:41:06.38 --> 00:41:08.38
But you're talking about a whole different thing.

927
00:41:08.38 --> 00:41:12.38
But I don't know what, people are going to say, people are going to ask on the

928
00:41:12.38 --> 00:41:15.38
interwebs to talk more about intermittent fasting.

929
00:41:15.38 --> 00:41:16.38
No.

930
00:41:16.38 --> 00:41:17.38
Don't ask me.

931
00:41:17.38 --> 00:41:19.38
There's like actual research out there.

932
00:41:19.38 --> 00:41:20.38
Yeah.

933
00:41:20.38 --> 00:41:21.38
Go and Google it.

934
00:41:21.38 --> 00:41:23.38
Look up in the last minute fasting and read about it.

935
00:41:23.38 --> 00:41:24.38
Don't ask me.

936
00:41:24.38 --> 00:41:25.38
I'm the wrong person to ask.

937
00:41:25.38 --> 00:41:26.38
Yeah.

938
00:41:26.38 --> 00:41:27.38
Ask smart people.

939
00:41:27.38 --> 00:41:28.38
Yeah.

940
00:41:28.38 --> 00:41:31.38
And again, the interminute fact, like if you're talking about this,

941
00:41:31.38 --> 00:41:34.38
like, you just brought him to like 10,000 questions on Twitter.

942
00:41:34.38 --> 00:41:35.38
Oh, yeah.

943
00:41:35.38 --> 00:41:36.38
Because it's true.

944
00:41:36.38 --> 00:41:40.38
Don't ask me Google it and look at these really good research papers.

945
00:41:40.38 --> 00:41:42.38
There's all kinds of stuff coming out about it right now.

946
00:41:42.38 --> 00:41:44.38
Now, what's weird about the internet.

947
00:41:44.38 --> 00:41:49.38
And science in general is in, you know, there's a one article that says,

948
00:41:49.38 --> 00:41:50.38
it's great.

949
00:41:50.38 --> 00:41:52.38
You can find two more articles that say it's horrible.

950
00:41:52.38 --> 00:41:54.38
You can find three more articles.

951
00:41:54.38 --> 00:41:56.38
So you can always counter everything.

952
00:41:56.38 --> 00:41:57.38
Yeah.

953
00:41:57.38 --> 00:42:02.38
I mean, that's not a but necessarily about science in general.

954
00:42:02.38 --> 00:42:05.38
It's more about a specific person's viewpoint.

955
00:42:05.38 --> 00:42:06.38
Well, yeah.

956
00:42:06.38 --> 00:42:07.38
Based on what they've done.

957
00:42:07.38 --> 00:42:08.38
Yeah, for sure.

958
00:42:08.38 --> 00:42:09.38
I've done that for sure.

959
00:42:09.38 --> 00:42:13.38
And especially with diet and health, it's so ambiguous.

960
00:42:13.38 --> 00:42:15.38
And so adaptable and stuff like that.

961
00:42:15.38 --> 00:42:18.38
So, but if you're talking about fasting, that's that's,

962
00:42:18.38 --> 00:42:20.38
you talk about something different.

963
00:42:20.38 --> 00:42:23.38
Like, you know, people fast for a specific reason,

964
00:42:23.38 --> 00:42:26.38
or even a kind of a general reason, but it's like,

965
00:42:26.38 --> 00:42:30.38
fasting alone isn't going to make you achieve whatever it is you're doing.

966
00:42:30.38 --> 00:42:32.38
You know, it's a complete, just like lifting,

967
00:42:32.38 --> 00:42:34.38
like with lifting, you need nutrition.

968
00:42:34.38 --> 00:42:35.38
You need rest.

969
00:42:35.38 --> 00:42:37.38
You need all this stuff for a specific results.

970
00:42:37.38 --> 00:42:38.38
And then there's all kinds of different lifting.

971
00:42:38.38 --> 00:42:40.38
You know, so you can't just be like,

972
00:42:40.38 --> 00:42:41.38
oh, yeah, I want bigger muscle.

973
00:42:41.38 --> 00:42:43.38
So I'm just going to lift that's it.

974
00:42:43.38 --> 00:42:44.38
No nutrition.

975
00:42:44.38 --> 00:42:45.38
I'm not going to eat it all.

976
00:42:45.38 --> 00:42:46.38
Or no rest.

977
00:42:46.38 --> 00:42:47.38
I'm not going to rest at all.

978
00:42:47.38 --> 00:42:54.38
So the point there is when you go trying to live as long as you possibly can,

979
00:42:54.38 --> 00:42:57.38
it's like you have to, like, that has to be the objective.

980
00:42:57.38 --> 00:43:00.38
Just to live everything else is not the window.

981
00:43:00.38 --> 00:43:04.38
So you, yeah, I don't, I agree with you.

982
00:43:04.38 --> 00:43:07.38
I don't think that that's living necessarily.

983
00:43:07.38 --> 00:43:10.38
I don't think there's too many people that are just on the full-on,

984
00:43:10.38 --> 00:43:11.38
the longevity gig.

985
00:43:11.38 --> 00:43:12.38
Yeah.

986
00:43:12.38 --> 00:43:13.38
But there are some?

987
00:43:13.38 --> 00:43:14.38
Yeah, I know.

988
00:43:14.38 --> 00:43:15.38
I know one.

989
00:43:15.38 --> 00:43:17.38
I'm not going to mention his name.

990
00:43:17.38 --> 00:43:20.38
Jack, I guess it's a bit your little secret.

991
00:43:20.38 --> 00:43:22.38
Next question.

992
00:43:22.38 --> 00:43:27.38
Similar question.

993
00:43:27.38 --> 00:43:28.38
Yeah.

994
00:43:28.38 --> 00:43:29.38
Jacko.

995
00:43:29.38 --> 00:43:35.38
Prioritizing execute is it wrong to sacrifice health in short term to accomplish work objectives,

996
00:43:35.38 --> 00:43:38.38
and how would you make up the time lost?

997
00:43:38.38 --> 00:43:40.38
So yeah, absolutely.

998
00:43:40.38 --> 00:43:44.38
Sometimes you have to sacrifice workouts for health and health for work objectives.

999
00:43:44.38 --> 00:43:50.38
There's no doubt that's life and work in many respects is life.

1000
00:43:50.38 --> 00:43:53.38
And that's kind of another topic.

1001
00:43:53.38 --> 00:43:55.38
But try and love what you're doing.

1002
00:43:55.38 --> 00:43:59.38
Try and enjoy your job if you don't because if you enjoy your job,

1003
00:43:59.38 --> 00:44:03.38
then work is life is an okay thing.

1004
00:44:03.38 --> 00:44:07.38
If you hate your job, then work is life is not a good situation to be in.

1005
00:44:07.38 --> 00:44:11.38
So try and get into things and do something that you enjoy doing.

1006
00:44:11.38 --> 00:44:15.38
And if you don't enjoy it, you know, find some kind of an exit strategy.

1007
00:44:15.38 --> 00:44:17.38
But that's another topic.

1008
00:44:17.38 --> 00:44:23.38
Going back to this topic is it okay or is it wrong to sacrifice your health and the short term

1009
00:44:23.38 --> 00:44:26.38
to accomplish long term work objectives?

1010
00:44:26.38 --> 00:44:30.38
And yeah, even in the SEAL teams, we did that all kinds of times.

1011
00:44:30.38 --> 00:44:36.38
A lot, whether it was in training or for mission where our priority or our mission or our training,

1012
00:44:36.38 --> 00:44:42.38
takes priority over workouts and over eating healthy and over everything.

1013
00:44:42.38 --> 00:44:47.38
So there's times where that you're just 100% focused on some kind of mission.

1014
00:44:47.38 --> 00:44:49.38
And that's what you're going to do.

1015
00:44:49.38 --> 00:44:51.38
And that's okay.

1016
00:44:51.38 --> 00:44:53.38
That's what we did in the SEAL teams and that's what everyone does.

1017
00:44:53.38 --> 00:44:55.38
And it's, and when you get done with that,

1018
00:44:55.38 --> 00:44:56.38
how do you make up for last time?

1019
00:44:56.38 --> 00:45:01.38
You do some hard workouts and maybe you go eat super clean or you fast for a little while.

1020
00:45:01.38 --> 00:45:02.38
Or whatever it is that get you back on track.

1021
00:45:02.38 --> 00:45:04.38
You just get yourself back on track.

1022
00:45:04.38 --> 00:45:07.38
What you have to watch out for is a pattern.

1023
00:45:07.38 --> 00:45:19.38
A long term pattern where work takes precedent over health for multiple weeks, right?

1024
00:45:19.38 --> 00:45:22.38
Multiple weeks and months.

1025
00:45:22.38 --> 00:45:23.38
Right?

1026
00:45:23.38 --> 00:45:25.38
If you're talking about months, we're in a bad situation.

1027
00:45:25.38 --> 00:45:28.38
Like if you go week two weeks where you just were crazy and work,

1028
00:45:28.38 --> 00:45:30.38
it was crazy and you know, you know, you know,

1029
00:45:30.38 --> 00:45:33.38
you know, your health took a little to went down a couple of notches on the priority.

1030
00:45:33.38 --> 00:45:35.38
And a couple of weeks goes by and you cook for them.

1031
00:45:35.38 --> 00:45:39.38
I'm glad I've got through that and the the hard season's over or the whatever.

1032
00:45:39.38 --> 00:45:42.38
You know, you know, people in the finance world and tax season.

1033
00:45:42.38 --> 00:45:45.38
They're just busting their ass for two, three, four straight weeks.

1034
00:45:45.38 --> 00:45:47.38
It's really hard.

1035
00:45:47.38 --> 00:45:51.38
It's understandable and, you know, retail people around Christmas time.

1036
00:45:51.38 --> 00:45:53.38
They're, you know, everyone's got their little sick things.

1037
00:45:53.38 --> 00:45:57.38
Real estate people in the springtime and the summer starts rolling around their work.

1038
00:45:57.38 --> 00:46:00.38
It's, it's, it's, they're sick, local things.

1039
00:46:00.38 --> 00:46:05.38
And that's cool. You work hard for two, three weeks where you just have to get after it.

1040
00:46:05.38 --> 00:46:11.38
But when that starts turning into months and in multiple weeks and then months and then

1041
00:46:11.38 --> 00:46:17.38
secular months of your health is taking the back seat, we have an issue now.

1042
00:46:17.38 --> 00:46:28.38
That being said, there are not too many jobs that consume 23 and a half hours a day of your time.

1043
00:46:28.38 --> 00:46:31.38
They're just not that many jobs that do that.

1044
00:46:31.38 --> 00:46:37.38
Now what, and what you might be facing here is you might be blaming your job for you being lazy.

1045
00:46:37.38 --> 00:46:41.38
That, that can be happening. That's a strong possibility actually.

1046
00:46:41.38 --> 00:46:46.38
Because you can make time for a 20 minute workout, right?

1047
00:46:46.38 --> 00:46:48.38
20 minute workout, right?

1048
00:46:48.38 --> 00:46:50.38
20 minute workout. Like that.

1049
00:46:50.38 --> 00:46:55.38
If you get 20 minutes, you get in a shake it out a little bit and you do, you know, a couple hundred

1050
00:46:55.38 --> 00:47:01.38
minutes. Go as hard as you can. You just got to work out that took you 10, 15, 20 minutes, right?

1051
00:47:01.38 --> 00:47:05.38
Well, yeah, longer than that for me, but yeah, you see what I'm saying, though.

1052
00:47:05.38 --> 00:47:09.38
I do, yeah, fully. You do, and then if you can do that, if you sprint, if you do 10

1053
00:47:09.38 --> 00:47:15.38
sprints, right? Doesn't take you much time. You do go, go knock out three, four, five sets of pull ups.

1054
00:47:15.38 --> 00:47:19.38
Go knock out a couple hundred pull ups. How long does that take?

1055
00:47:19.38 --> 00:47:22.38
It doesn't take that long. Right?

1056
00:47:22.38 --> 00:47:28.38
You take 15 minutes. You're done. So then maybe at night, you just roll up there.

1057
00:47:28.38 --> 00:47:32.38
You grab your kettlebone. You knock out some swings. It takes you seven minutes.

1058
00:47:32.38 --> 00:47:36.38
We're not talking about a bunch of times. So are we being lazy?

1059
00:47:36.38 --> 00:47:40.38
Because we're not carving out 15, 20 minutes, half an hour.

1060
00:47:40.38 --> 00:47:43.38
You know, a lot of people ask me about what the workouts I do when I'm on the road.

1061
00:47:43.38 --> 00:47:47.38
A lot of times when I'm on the road, I fly into a city. I get there 11 o'clock at night.

1062
00:47:47.38 --> 00:47:50.38
The next time I'm next to am working with a company in eight o'clock in the morning.

1063
00:47:50.38 --> 00:47:54.38
And so my schedule is tight. Why am I in the hotel room? The hotel room?

1064
00:47:54.38 --> 00:47:56.38
Do you have some sucks for one thing?

1065
00:47:56.38 --> 00:47:59.38
And I'm going to bang something out quickly.

1066
00:47:59.38 --> 00:48:02.38
You know, it's not going to be an hour workout.

1067
00:48:02.38 --> 00:48:04.38
No, it's going to be like 20 minutes sometimes.

1068
00:48:04.38 --> 00:48:08.38
Now sometimes if I have a little extra time, maybe I'm not meeting with the company until lunch.

1069
00:48:08.38 --> 00:48:11.38
Cool. I'm going to have a nice long workout, of course.

1070
00:48:11.38 --> 00:48:16.38
But if it's, I'm due to meet with a CEO for breakfast at seven o'clock.

1071
00:48:16.38 --> 00:48:21.38
It's going to be a quick hardcore 12 minute workout.

1072
00:48:21.38 --> 00:48:24.38
And that's cool. So you've got to carve that out.

1073
00:48:24.38 --> 00:48:34.38
And this is so, you know, make sure that it's the job that's doing this to you and not you that's doing this to you.

1074
00:48:34.38 --> 00:48:40.38
Yeah. So if it is your job, truly,

1075
00:48:40.38 --> 00:48:48.38
your job is the thing that's making you unhealthy, then you've got to fix it. Now what you have going for you is that company's want you to be healthy.

1076
00:48:48.38 --> 00:48:55.38
Right. Companies understand the benefit of having healthy employees, not just from a productivity standpoint,

1077
00:48:55.38 --> 00:48:57.38
but from like an insurance viewpoint.

1078
00:48:57.38 --> 00:49:06.38
We, if we got a, you know, we've got a health coverage for our employees and all of our employees are sick and and lame and lazy and we're having to pay their medical bills.

1079
00:49:06.38 --> 00:49:13.38
And they can't work. It's problematic. So what you do is you step up and you say, hey, you know what, we don't have a health and wellness program. I want to run it.

1080
00:49:13.38 --> 00:49:19.38
We need a little gym. Oh, you, it's going to cost money. Yes, it's going to cost money. We're going to save you money and productivity.

1081
00:49:19.38 --> 00:49:28.38
I'm going to save you money and insurance. I'm going to write a point paper on that. I'm going to win that one all day long. We're going to, we're going to put a gym in the lounge.

1082
00:49:28.38 --> 00:49:34.38
And we're going to put, we're going to put some mats in the donor room. You know what I'm saying? So we're going to, we're going to do it.

1083
00:49:34.38 --> 00:49:44.38
Well, I think LinkedIn has a GG to room. You mean LinkedIn? I think I saw a picture of they have a GG to room. Good idea. Yeah, you didn't even have to pay me to work there.

1084
00:49:44.38 --> 00:49:55.38
So you got your GG to room. Oh, I remember. Yeah. So get so, so go, you know, step up your company. I can not guarantee your company wants you to be healthy.

1085
00:49:55.38 --> 00:50:04.38
So step up, maybe take leadership role and forming the health and wellness program for your company. Get it.

1086
00:50:04.38 --> 00:50:13.38
Funny, my brother's company. You know it. Rackmop. He, they don't have a, they don't have a, you know, a mat and obviously in the office.

1087
00:50:13.38 --> 00:50:24.38
But yet, yeah, but working. It's funny though. He'll like he'll do this. He'll encourage people to go to GG to, you know, to the point where they have rash guards even.

1088
00:50:24.38 --> 00:50:32.38
Yeah, we have a pretty good representation from frag now about the gym. Yeah. You know, I call everyone from frag mom that trains. You know, and I nicknamed them all of them frag mob.

1089
00:50:32.38 --> 00:50:35.38
Everyone from frag mob. That's a nice. Oh, that's their actual name.

1090
00:50:35.38 --> 00:50:36.38
I mean, frag mob.

1091
00:50:36.38 --> 00:50:39.38
I can't even imagine anymore. No, you're name is frag mob.

1092
00:50:39.38 --> 00:50:48.38
Yeah. So, but that's good because it becomes this culture that kind of catches on. You know, where, and this is just, you can be kind of anything crossfit or even spin, I don't know, whatever.

1093
00:50:48.38 --> 00:50:56.38
But, do you just as kind of good because it's one of those ones that you can kind of come and talk about it and, you know, it's hooked you out. Are you choked me out kind of thing? You can choke your boss if he's there.

1094
00:50:56.38 --> 00:50:58.38
Yeah, it's like that kind of stuff. It's real fun.

1095
00:50:58.38 --> 00:51:11.38
And they even have like rat, like I said, rash guards, the rash guards like if you work for frag mob, it'll say staff on the back. It'll have like, you know, they do like, and you know, development stuff like that.

1096
00:51:11.38 --> 00:51:24.38
So the staff one will be, um, what does it have on the sleeves like digital or circuitry? Yeah. And then the other one says, we'll say security. That's like, you know, friends of the friends or the friends or the friends.

1097
00:51:24.38 --> 00:51:27.38
But it's never going to be between the hardware and the software rash guards.

1098
00:51:27.38 --> 00:51:36.38
Right, right. That's what I mean. That's exactly what it is. So the soft guys who actually work for frag mob have the software rash guards. That has like circuitry on the design and then the hardware.

1099
00:51:36.38 --> 00:51:46.38
Oh, no, sorry, the software is a little zero in one. Yes, the code. Yes, exactly. And the security guys who work anyway, nonetheless, that's kind of.

1100
00:51:46.38 --> 00:52:05.38
That's like a good, because that's not really an official program in frag mob or in a company. It's just it's kind of the influential element of the culture, you know, where it's like, and you know, my brother, he, he pushed that, you know, not kind of overtly, I guess, but it's more it was like, you guys have to do this.

1101
00:52:05.38 --> 00:52:14.38
Like, hey, you should come down. I'll give you a rash guarding. Okay, cool. And guys, and it was funny. There's a time there's a bunch of frag mob doing there. Just going interesting. But yeah, that helps.

1102
00:52:14.38 --> 00:52:26.38
That's not for sure. Now, the thing is, if none of that works, if you if your company is just dragging you down and and you've checked and double checked and triple checked your own discipline or lack of discipline.

1103
00:52:26.38 --> 00:52:36.38
And you realize that it's the work that is bringing down your health. In that case, you got to follow the procedure. You got to find an exit strategy. Create an exit strategy.

1104
00:52:36.38 --> 00:52:45.38
Save up your money. Line things up. Get the ducks and row in the next queue. Because your health is going to be more important than everything else.

1105
00:52:45.38 --> 00:52:55.38
Yeah, been everything else. All that money you could possibly make. If you got a sacrifice a year and a half, two years and you're going to grind it out like an investment bank or the chills up on Wall Street is going to grind for two years.

1106
00:52:55.38 --> 00:53:04.38
And their health is going to suffer. But they've got to go on at the end of that. Hey, understood. You sometimes you got to do, but you got to at the end of that two, three years.

1107
00:53:04.38 --> 00:53:11.38
If you're not there and you're not where you want to be and you're starting to decline and health, they're going to get some stuff you won't be able to recover from.

1108
00:53:11.38 --> 00:53:14.38
So make your make your decision.

1109
00:53:14.38 --> 00:53:24.38
Then you call up with an exit strategy and move on. Do something else. Yeah, and health health and even like fitness is.

1110
00:53:24.38 --> 00:53:37.38
Is this thing is called systemic versus direct, you know, as far as being beneficial. So exercise is like one of the few things in your little hierarchy of like needs or whatever.

1111
00:53:37.38 --> 00:53:49.38
That affects everything else. Like if you if you're unhealthy person versus a healthy person, the healthy person will be better at everything else. He'll be better making money. He'll be better at all relationships.

1112
00:53:49.38 --> 00:53:55.38
He'll be better obviously health wise in and of itself. I mean, obviously if you've got some guy that's brilliant.

1113
00:53:55.38 --> 00:54:08.38
And really out of shape versus a guy that's an idiot who's in great shape. The brilliant person's probably going to make more money and you do better in the long run. I mean, we're talking. You have to put them on a level in the lecture.

1114
00:54:08.38 --> 00:54:12.38
Yeah, you're talking about the same person. Oh, yeah, then for sure for sure.

1115
00:54:12.38 --> 00:54:14.38
But the healthier person was going to win.

1116
00:54:14.38 --> 00:54:26.38
So and compare that to the directly like people would be like, hey, making money is important. So it's more important than health. But he's thinking, making money doesn't improve your health.

1117
00:54:26.38 --> 00:54:35.38
Making money doesn't necessarily improve friendship or romantic relationships necessarily. In fact, a lot of times it damages them a lot of the times health doesn't damage anything. It improves everything. There's not

1118
00:54:35.38 --> 00:54:45.38
anything that I can think of anyway that health makes worse. Yeah, or being more fit makes worse get healthy stay healthy. Yeah, stay on the program. You know what?

1119
00:54:45.38 --> 00:54:53.38
And it's one of those things to men. Those like working out when you're on the road. That's a big one. Right. It's hard to like get a solid workout on the road because you're busy or whatever.

1120
00:54:53.38 --> 00:55:03.38
But there's this is going to sound crazy. But when you think about it's not not crazy, but sound kind of unrealistic where Kate. So this would have been doing recently when we went to New York for the monster and like all these.

1121
00:55:03.38 --> 00:55:13.38
Before I go, I'll research due to gyms and fitness gyms where I can work out because like you said the hotel gym is like, if you don't have anything else in you, but you still have time. Okay. Good.

1122
00:55:13.38 --> 00:55:21.38
But a research where are the gyms and prepare like, okay, how long is it going to take me to get there, work out, get back all the stuff and then you fit it in your schedule.

1123
00:55:21.38 --> 00:55:27.38
And here's the thing, if you don't want to fit in your schedule, then don't work out. Then if then health is not for you then.

1124
00:55:27.38 --> 00:55:37.38
But if you're like, oh, you're asking, you know, this kind of question where, you know, is it wrong to sacrifice health and all this stuff? That means you're concerned about health.

1125
00:55:37.38 --> 00:55:40.38
Then be concerned about health. You can fit it in.

1126
00:55:40.38 --> 00:55:45.38
It's the surprise what you can fit in. Just like you don't have to get that good of a workout, but you're fitting it in.

1127
00:55:45.38 --> 00:55:50.38
But here's the thing, you can fit in a good workout. You just gotta make room for that. You got to plan it.

1128
00:55:50.38 --> 00:55:58.38
And then the logical went to like, if I'm going to speak somewhere, it had a minimum. I'll do a couple hundred burpees before I go.

1129
00:55:58.38 --> 00:56:02.38
When I wake up, that just gets the blood flow and you're ready rocking all.

1130
00:56:02.38 --> 00:56:03.38
Yeah.

1131
00:56:03.38 --> 00:56:06.38
But at the master, there was no break in the program.

1132
00:56:06.38 --> 00:56:14.38
I went to 24 fitness rolled a hard one at hand. So it's in the middle of the master, which wasn't hard necessarily, but there's a lot of roles in there.

1133
00:56:14.38 --> 00:56:24.38
And so man, it was, there was no break in the program. But the point is because I knew that that was, I made time exactly right. It was important.

1134
00:56:24.38 --> 00:56:30.38
And I don't want to say it's important. Like it's the number one priority. I'm saying it's part of the, the whole, what I'm doing.

1135
00:56:30.38 --> 00:56:34.38
If it's not part of what you're doing, then don't be healthy. Then don't make it part of what you're doing.

1136
00:56:34.38 --> 00:56:38.38
I vote against you on that one. I say, make time be healthy.

1137
00:56:38.38 --> 00:56:41.38
Yeah, I think so too. That's my opinion. But I'm saying it helped you.

1138
00:56:41.38 --> 00:56:46.38
I don't exactly. You know what I'm saying? Like, you're saying if I don't have time, my job is so whatever.

1139
00:56:46.38 --> 00:56:51.38
Hey, if you straight up, don't have time. Think you don't have time. Help is not for you. You chose everything else over help.

1140
00:56:51.38 --> 00:56:52.38
And that's up to you.

1141
00:56:52.38 --> 00:56:56.38
I'm going to go ahead and go on and let me hear that most people you can make time.

1142
00:56:56.38 --> 00:56:59.38
That's the point. That's my wake up half hour earlier.

1143
00:56:59.38 --> 00:57:02.38
Yeah, because you know, you know, when you really don't have time.

1144
00:57:02.38 --> 00:57:09.38
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like one time, I don't know two or three months ago, we were, we came in.

1145
00:57:09.38 --> 00:57:15.38
And we skipped jujitsu to record the podcast. And I was like, man, we skipped jujitsu to record the podcast.

1146
00:57:15.38 --> 00:57:18.38
Right. It was like, we didn't do that. We weren't going to get out of flight.

1147
00:57:18.38 --> 00:57:21.38
And after noon. And we just had to do it.

1148
00:57:21.38 --> 00:57:24.38
And so yeah, occasionally that those things happen.

1149
00:57:24.38 --> 00:57:30.38
Yeah, so consider that. Right. So it's either skipped jujitsu one day and get the podcast out.

1150
00:57:30.38 --> 00:57:36.38
Or don't we could ease, we could have chosen trained jujitsu. Don't do the podcast.

1151
00:57:36.38 --> 00:57:40.38
But at that point given all the circumstances, the podcast at one day.

1152
00:57:40.38 --> 00:57:45.38
It's keeping jujitsu one day is my part in for that one day because it's not like we're giving up jujitsu completely for this.

1153
00:57:45.38 --> 00:57:50.38
It's not that actually holding the line with the podcast exactly right. And that was important that day,

1154
00:57:50.38 --> 00:57:55.38
because we're kind of faced with that thing. What do you give up? So what that's the question. What do you give up?

1155
00:57:55.38 --> 00:58:01.38
Do you give up watching a movie and room service? Do you give that up? Give that up?

1156
00:58:01.38 --> 00:58:04.38
Yes, give that up. Like I said, hey, if you don't have time, I got a hotel.

1157
00:58:04.38 --> 00:58:09.38
I don't even turn on the TV. Yeah, I don't even turn on TV because I don't have TV at home.

1158
00:58:09.38 --> 00:58:14.38
And so I don't know a year or two ago, I went to some hotel and I've turned on the TV.

1159
00:58:14.38 --> 00:58:18.38
And next thing I know, you know an hour and a half went by.

1160
00:58:18.38 --> 00:58:20.38
And I was watching some movie from 1986.

1161
00:58:20.38 --> 00:58:23.38
Do you think you've got to be kidding me? Turn it off.

1162
00:58:23.38 --> 00:58:26.38
You know what I always do? I hang my chalk bag on the TV.

1163
00:58:26.38 --> 00:58:29.38
That's my standard operating seizure.

1164
00:58:29.38 --> 00:58:32.38
I hang my chalk. Because you know, they're all the thin TVs.

1165
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:35.38
When you travel, when I travel, so you bring your chalk bag.

1166
00:58:35.38 --> 00:58:38.38
Yes, I bring chalk bag. I bring sweat bands from my wrist.

1167
00:58:38.38 --> 00:58:41.38
Because I sweat. I bring a chalk bag. I bring my little notebook.

1168
00:58:41.38 --> 00:58:47.38
I bring a mobility, wad, ball to do some mobility work.

1169
00:58:47.38 --> 00:58:53.38
And I bring some one-inch tubular nylon that I use to stretch.

1170
00:58:53.38 --> 00:58:55.38
Oh, that's what I bring. You're good to be originally.

1171
00:58:55.38 --> 00:58:58.38
Like when we went to the monster, I brought rings with me.

1172
00:58:58.38 --> 00:58:59.38
Yes, that's good.

1173
00:58:59.38 --> 00:59:02.38
Because I knew I was going to be on a tight timeline and knew it was going to have to,

1174
00:59:02.38 --> 00:59:04.38
you know, get some workouts done.

1175
00:59:04.38 --> 00:59:06.38
And I traveled a little bit heavier.

1176
00:59:06.38 --> 00:59:10.38
Because I normally travel really light, but I had an extra bag.

1177
00:59:10.38 --> 00:59:11.38
So then, rings.

1178
00:59:11.38 --> 00:59:14.38
No factor. You were there for a while too.

1179
00:59:14.38 --> 00:59:14.38
Yeah.

1180
00:59:14.38 --> 00:59:15.38
A couple weeks.

1181
00:59:15.38 --> 00:59:19.38
Yeah, I was in Austria and then came back to New York and then from New York to Texas.

1182
00:59:19.38 --> 00:59:20.38
So there's a road trip.

1183
00:59:20.38 --> 00:59:21.38
Yeah.

1184
00:59:21.38 --> 00:59:23.38
Thanks, see. And you made it happen.

1185
00:59:23.38 --> 00:59:26.38
And you're busier than the normal person in my opinion.

1186
00:59:26.38 --> 00:59:27.38
Kind of busy.

1187
00:59:27.38 --> 00:59:29.38
Yeah.

1188
00:59:29.38 --> 00:59:33.38
But again, man, I think you know how that old saying.

1189
00:59:33.38 --> 00:59:35.38
I think I don't know. You might have said,

1190
00:59:35.38 --> 00:59:37.38
I don't know where I saw it.

1191
00:59:37.38 --> 00:59:41.38
But it's like, there is no free time or spare time or you know,

1192
00:59:41.38 --> 00:59:42.38
work that there's just time.

1193
00:59:42.38 --> 00:59:43.38
You know, it's one of those things.

1194
00:59:43.38 --> 00:59:44.38
Oh, do you like time that is wrong?

1195
00:59:44.38 --> 00:59:45.38
That's a wrong.

1196
00:59:45.38 --> 00:59:45.38
Yeah.

1197
00:59:45.38 --> 00:59:46.38
So it's like time.

1198
00:59:46.38 --> 00:59:48.38
So there's no spare time. There's no free time.

1199
00:59:48.38 --> 00:59:49.38
There's just life time.

1200
00:59:49.38 --> 00:59:50.38
Just time.

1201
00:59:50.38 --> 00:59:50.38
Yeah.

1202
00:59:50.38 --> 00:59:51.38
So you better just get on it.

1203
00:59:51.38 --> 00:59:53.38
So unless you're like Peter a tear,

1204
00:59:53.38 --> 00:59:55.38
remember when he was talking about what Peter a tear was talking about.

1205
00:59:55.38 --> 00:59:57.38
Like there was no time.

1206
00:59:57.38 --> 00:59:58.38
You're just working the whole time.

1207
00:59:58.38 --> 00:59:59.38
Like you can't even sleep.

1208
00:59:59.38 --> 01:00:00.38
Oh, yeah.

1209
01:00:00.38 --> 01:00:01.38
When he's at Med School.

1210
01:00:01.38 --> 01:00:01.38
Yeah.

1211
01:00:01.38 --> 01:00:03.38
So if you're in that situation,

1212
01:00:03.38 --> 01:00:04.38
then that makes sense.

1213
01:00:04.38 --> 01:00:05.38
You're not going to be like,

1214
01:00:05.38 --> 01:00:08.38
Okay, I'm not doing this part of my Med Med program.

1215
01:00:08.38 --> 01:00:12.38
You're pulling on the side of the road to a park to fall asleep for an hour.

1216
01:00:12.38 --> 01:00:13.38
Because you had slept the nine days.

1217
01:00:13.38 --> 01:00:14.38
Yeah.

1218
01:00:14.38 --> 01:00:16.38
So there are exceptions for sure.

1219
01:00:16.38 --> 01:00:21.38
But again, like if you're doing room service or you're watching the game

1220
01:00:21.38 --> 01:00:24.38
or you're stopping at the bar or doing anything.

1221
01:00:24.38 --> 01:00:26.38
I'm not even saying necessarily destructive things.

1222
01:00:26.38 --> 01:00:30.38
I'm just saying things that don't aren't conducive to your quote unquote work.

1223
01:00:30.38 --> 01:00:33.38
That's keeping you so busy or whatever that are essential.

1224
01:00:33.38 --> 01:00:34.38
If you're doing these other things,

1225
01:00:34.38 --> 01:00:36.38
then there's where you can make time.

1226
01:00:36.38 --> 01:00:40.38
How can one ever have time if you don't take time?

1227
01:00:40.38 --> 01:00:41.38
I like it.

1228
01:00:44.38 --> 01:00:45.38
Next question.

1229
01:00:47.38 --> 01:00:50.38
My wife and kids are quick to anger.

1230
01:00:50.38 --> 01:00:52.38
Sometimes it's explosive.

1231
01:00:52.38 --> 01:00:55.38
Like the Moab mother of all bombs.

1232
01:00:55.38 --> 01:00:58.38
Other times it's a slow grinding war of attrition.

1233
01:00:58.38 --> 01:01:00.38
Being a student of your podcast,

1234
01:01:00.38 --> 01:01:05.38
I've learned the worst strategy is to directly attack their fortified emotional position.

1235
01:01:05.38 --> 01:01:09.38
Seems like this is a good opportunity to employ the flanking maneuver.

1236
01:01:09.38 --> 01:01:14.38
How do I effectively flank their anger without appearing weak?

1237
01:01:14.38 --> 01:01:16.38
Okay, first of all, flank yourself.

1238
01:01:16.38 --> 01:01:19.38
Because that appearing weak thing, that's pretty much in your head.

1239
01:01:19.38 --> 01:01:20.38
Really?

1240
01:01:20.38 --> 01:01:25.38
Well, generally in your head, and that's the first thing you need to do is that's your ego talking when you don't want to.

1241
01:01:25.38 --> 01:01:27.38
When you don't want to.

1242
01:01:27.38 --> 01:01:30.38
When they hit you with something that they're angry at,

1243
01:01:30.38 --> 01:01:32.38
the thing that's hitting back is ego.

1244
01:01:32.38 --> 01:01:33.38
That's what's hitting back.

1245
01:01:33.38 --> 01:01:36.38
So first thing you gotta do is okay, I'm gonna check my ego right now.

1246
01:01:36.38 --> 01:01:38.38
Because I'm gonna win the long war.

1247
01:01:38.38 --> 01:01:44.38
In fact, you have to be careful when you stay calm when everyone else is angry.

1248
01:01:44.38 --> 01:01:49.38
You have to actually be careful not to come across as a loof or you're not going to be a good person.

1249
01:01:49.38 --> 01:01:51.38
Or you know arrogant.

1250
01:01:51.38 --> 01:01:52.38
Yeah, yeah.

1251
01:01:52.38 --> 01:02:00.38
When people are getting mad, okay, okay, for instance, if your wife is super mad about something and you show no emotions and you don't come at it all, they get madder.

1252
01:02:00.38 --> 01:02:01.38
So that's the right.

1253
01:02:01.38 --> 01:02:03.38
Yeah, you don't even care about this.

1254
01:02:03.38 --> 01:02:08.38
Yeah, so no, no, so you gotta give a little bit, you know, I'll tell you now.

1255
01:02:08.38 --> 01:02:12.38
You know, the little bit of, hey, I get it, right?

1256
01:02:12.38 --> 01:02:15.38
But then which one do is absorb them?

1257
01:02:15.38 --> 01:02:22.38
Oh, they want to get mad, cool, absorb, take the screaming, give the head nod of understanding in a,

1258
01:02:22.38 --> 01:02:30.38
only marginally emotional way that pretty much communicates that, I understand you're mad and I'm listening, and I hear you.

1259
01:02:30.38 --> 01:02:33.38
You know, I get it and let them get it out of their system.

1260
01:02:33.38 --> 01:02:36.38
Just let them get it out of their system, then let them calm down.

1261
01:02:36.38 --> 01:02:43.38
And then after you've given them the time to kind of calm down and settle down.

1262
01:02:43.38 --> 01:02:47.38
And I mean, it's longer than you think.

1263
01:02:47.38 --> 01:02:49.38
It's longer than you think.

1264
01:02:49.38 --> 01:02:56.38
Let them let, let, when you think they're calm, weight, an extra 45 minutes.

1265
01:02:56.38 --> 01:03:00.38
If not two hours, probably two hours, because they're not calm.

1266
01:03:00.38 --> 01:03:02.38
They just stop screaming, right?

1267
01:03:02.38 --> 01:03:03.38
They're not calm.

1268
01:03:03.38 --> 01:03:10.38
So, and then what you do is, and then what's to use your kind of take it on yourself, you're going to own it, right?

1269
01:03:10.38 --> 01:03:14.38
And you say something like, hey, you know, that thing that made you mad, I want to make sure it doesn't happen again.

1270
01:03:14.38 --> 01:03:18.38
You know, what can I do better to make sure that you don't get mad about that, right?

1271
01:03:18.38 --> 01:03:20.38
You take, you take ownership of that.

1272
01:03:20.38 --> 01:03:23.38
What do I need to do adjust?

1273
01:03:23.38 --> 01:03:27.38
And what exactly is it that, that, that, that, that, that frustrated, what is it that frustrated?

1274
01:03:27.38 --> 01:03:29.38
What is it that frustrated you, what can I do to stop it?

1275
01:03:29.38 --> 01:03:33.38
Maybe it wasn't me, maybe you're mad at the printer, but you know, how can we fix that?

1276
01:03:33.38 --> 01:03:38.38
Because I don't want you to, and then you know, so you have that kind of conversation.

1277
01:03:38.38 --> 01:03:46.38
And you know, you're going to slide something tactfully, and they're tactfully, because again, you're still dealing with like, you know,

1278
01:03:46.38 --> 01:03:50.38
Proposable flare-ups, and there he goes after me.

1279
01:03:50.38 --> 01:03:55.38
So, you know, but you say something like, you know, we both know that nobody benefits when people lose their temper, right?

1280
01:03:55.38 --> 01:04:01.38
I mean, we got to be careful, you know, no one, it's not, it doesn't do us any good when people lose their temper.

1281
01:04:01.38 --> 01:04:02.38
Everyone knows that, right?

1282
01:04:02.38 --> 01:04:04.38
So you slide those things in there, you're giving that kind of like,

1283
01:04:04.38 --> 01:04:08.38
little, little, mini lecture indirectly about what's happened.

1284
01:04:08.38 --> 01:04:12.38
And then when you have other conversations, now we're in just a normal day-to-day thing.

1285
01:04:12.38 --> 01:04:15.38
You drop things about temper, you know, you talk about temper, be it?

1286
01:04:15.38 --> 01:04:19.38
Well, you know, it's a weakness, and it's no one makes good decisions when they have them.

1287
01:04:19.38 --> 01:04:20.38
Then those are temper, everything.

1288
01:04:20.38 --> 01:04:23.38
So some of the dumbest things I've ever done was when I love, you know, everyone knows that, but you know,

1289
01:04:23.38 --> 01:04:27.38
you say you start sliding those things in there that it's bad for your decision-making.

1290
01:04:27.38 --> 01:04:32.38
It's bad for relationships, it's bad for your health, it's bad for life.

1291
01:04:32.38 --> 01:04:36.38
And again, you're not directly saying these things. You're subliminally saying,

1292
01:04:36.38 --> 01:04:41.38
you know, it's man, I remember one time I lost some of those dumbest things I ever did when I lost my temper.

1293
01:04:41.38 --> 01:04:46.38
When I kicked the wall and I broke my toe and I put a hole in the wall and the landlord came.

1294
01:04:46.38 --> 01:04:50.38
That's when I hit when I lose my temper.

1295
01:04:50.38 --> 01:04:56.38
And you start getting them in the, you're even thinking about it over time.

1296
01:04:56.38 --> 01:04:58.38
And this is the thing, it's a long war.

1297
01:04:58.38 --> 01:05:14.38
And there's going to be relapses along the way, but you got to just hold the line, keep it steady, absorb, and then flank gently to get them to start self recognizing,

1298
01:05:14.38 --> 01:05:17.38
whether at and what their temper does to them.

1299
01:05:17.38 --> 01:05:19.38
Temper is crazy.

1300
01:05:19.38 --> 01:05:24.38
Yeah, when you see people lose their temper, it's, it's a total loss control.

1301
01:05:24.38 --> 01:05:28.38
And it's, it doesn't do anybody any good.

1302
01:05:28.38 --> 01:05:32.38
And when you see someone that really loses their temper, you're like,

1303
01:05:32.38 --> 01:05:33.38
what a wrong.

1304
01:05:33.38 --> 01:05:35.38
Yeah, I'm on.

1305
01:05:35.38 --> 01:05:36.38
Yeah.

1306
01:05:36.38 --> 01:05:38.38
And when I was a kid, nice to lose my temper.

1307
01:05:38.38 --> 01:05:41.38
And at some point I just realized, I forget what it was.

1308
01:05:41.38 --> 01:05:43.38
I forget what made me think of it.

1309
01:05:43.38 --> 01:05:48.38
Something my dad said to me, there's something about, you know, something along those lines of like,

1310
01:05:48.38 --> 01:05:51.38
I'm, you lose your temper. It's like a little baby.

1311
01:05:51.38 --> 01:05:54.38
Oh, loss of control.

1312
01:05:54.38 --> 01:05:57.38
Okay, so you, when you realized it, that's because of that.

1313
01:05:57.38 --> 01:05:59.38
Yeah, it's a dead set to me.

1314
01:05:59.38 --> 01:06:03.38
Something along the lines of like, you know, I think he was referring to an athlete or something.

1315
01:06:03.38 --> 01:06:06.38
Someone that just had no emotions and how that was impressive.

1316
01:06:06.38 --> 01:06:07.38
Yeah.

1317
01:06:07.38 --> 01:06:10.38
And I was like, hmm, that is impressive.

1318
01:06:10.38 --> 01:06:11.38
Massive control.

1319
01:06:11.38 --> 01:06:12.38
Yeah.

1320
01:06:12.38 --> 01:06:14.38
One's nothing is going to make me mad.

1321
01:06:14.38 --> 01:06:15.38
Yeah.

1322
01:06:15.38 --> 01:06:17.38
Doesn't matter what's going on around me.

1323
01:06:17.38 --> 01:06:18.38
Yeah.

1324
01:06:18.38 --> 01:06:20.38
Yeah, it is like a baby, you know.

1325
01:06:20.38 --> 01:06:24.38
Like babies, they cry and they, whatever, because they don't know how to talk.

1326
01:06:24.38 --> 01:06:28.38
So if they knew how to talk and control everything, they just be like, hey, I'm cold.

1327
01:06:28.38 --> 01:06:30.38
Or hey, I'm hungry.

1328
01:06:30.38 --> 01:06:31.38
But they don't know how to talk.

1329
01:06:31.38 --> 01:06:33.38
So why do adults go crazy and cry?

1330
01:06:33.38 --> 01:06:34.38
Because they're babies.

1331
01:06:34.38 --> 01:06:35.38
Because they don't know how to talk.

1332
01:06:35.38 --> 01:06:37.38
If they, if they cry for every little thing, their babies.

1333
01:06:37.38 --> 01:06:38.38
Yeah, they don't know how to talk.

1334
01:06:38.38 --> 01:06:40.38
I said, actually, you know what?

1335
01:06:40.38 --> 01:06:45.38
Under any depends, it depends how much control and all these little variables.

1336
01:06:45.38 --> 01:06:46.38
But it's like the front part of your brain.

1337
01:06:46.38 --> 01:06:48.38
That's a decision making like the conscious like, oh, okay.

1338
01:06:48.38 --> 01:06:51.38
I'm going to make this this this conscious decision, right?

1339
01:06:51.38 --> 01:06:53.38
Which is the last part of your brain to develop that way.

1340
01:06:53.38 --> 01:06:55.38
And it's the conscious decision making.

1341
01:06:55.38 --> 01:06:57.38
Get a front, the front, the front, the right.

1342
01:06:57.38 --> 01:06:59.38
Or text, you know, something like this.

1343
01:06:59.38 --> 01:07:03.38
And it happens and it fully develops around age 25, by the way.

1344
01:07:03.38 --> 01:07:06.38
So if you're 24, 23, 22, 21, and all.

1345
01:07:06.38 --> 01:07:09.38
And so it puts simply it's like, okay, my actions now,

1346
01:07:09.38 --> 01:07:11.38
how do they affect the future, you know.

1347
01:07:11.38 --> 01:07:16.38
So in one way or another, it's going to be kind of surrounded on that little premise.

1348
01:07:16.38 --> 01:07:17.38
Small little press.

1349
01:07:17.38 --> 01:07:20.38
So otherwise you're just going to straight auto mode.

1350
01:07:20.38 --> 01:07:25.38
However, you're, however you feel that's going to influence not going to totally control,

1351
01:07:25.38 --> 01:07:27.38
but that's the thing that's going to influence your behaviors.

1352
01:07:27.38 --> 01:07:32.38
So times of stress, your frontal cortex start to shut down a little bit.

1353
01:07:32.38 --> 01:07:34.38
Hunger, shut down a little bit.

1354
01:07:34.38 --> 01:07:38.38
Uph, hormonal situations for guys and girls.

1355
01:07:38.38 --> 01:07:39.38
Also you lose your temper more.

1356
01:07:39.38 --> 01:07:41.38
That's where anger becomes from.

1357
01:07:41.38 --> 01:07:44.38
Hanging is one of them, you know, and it's like all these things.

1358
01:07:44.38 --> 01:07:48.38
But the loss of like all this stuff where your decisions just aren't that dope.

1359
01:07:48.38 --> 01:07:53.38
And so when I say hormonal, like that's why you get right rage.

1360
01:07:53.38 --> 01:07:56.38
You know, because like guys are throwing steroids.

1361
01:07:56.38 --> 01:07:59.38
That's their hormones are up or girls.

1362
01:07:59.38 --> 01:08:04.38
PMS in, it's like a real, you know, pre-menstrual syndrome.

1363
01:08:04.38 --> 01:08:06.38
It's like real, their hormones are all.

1364
01:08:06.38 --> 01:08:09.38
I don't know one time my wife started when she was pregnant.

1365
01:08:09.38 --> 01:08:12.38
She started crying during an AT&T commercial.

1366
01:08:12.38 --> 01:08:14.38
Maggulajek.

1367
01:08:14.38 --> 01:08:16.38
So no, no, no.

1368
01:08:16.38 --> 01:08:18.38
Oh my god, it's wrong with her.

1369
01:08:18.38 --> 01:08:20.38
Some of those are kind of sad.

1370
01:08:20.38 --> 01:08:21.38
They're emotional.

1371
01:08:21.38 --> 01:08:23.38
Nonetheless, so why were you crying during Hawaii Five O'Reilly?

1372
01:08:23.38 --> 01:08:24.38
Oh, man.

1373
01:08:24.38 --> 01:08:29.38
I'm telling you, they're trying to make it deep, man.

1374
01:08:29.38 --> 01:08:31.38
That show you're watching, not easy.

1375
01:08:31.38 --> 01:08:36.38
Anyway, nonetheless, it's back to losing your temper and stuff.

1376
01:08:36.38 --> 01:08:38.38
It is a weak thing.

1377
01:08:38.38 --> 01:08:41.38
So it's kind of obvious, especially from the outside to see that,

1378
01:08:41.38 --> 01:08:43.38
but losing your temper is not cool.

1379
01:08:43.38 --> 01:08:45.38
And a lot of people, they think it's cool because it feels good.

1380
01:08:45.38 --> 01:08:46.38
Yeah, that was good.

1381
01:08:46.38 --> 01:08:48.38
And when you're a little kid, you respect it.

1382
01:08:48.38 --> 01:08:49.38
You see someone losing your temper?

1383
01:08:49.38 --> 01:08:50.38
You scare my gut.

1384
01:08:50.38 --> 01:08:51.38
Yeah, how are you?

1385
01:08:51.38 --> 01:08:53.38
It's how you're turning into Superman, right?

1386
01:08:53.38 --> 01:08:54.38
Yeah, in a way.

1387
01:08:54.38 --> 01:08:56.38
It's mean, he's scared.

1388
01:08:56.38 --> 01:08:58.38
But right, you're not feared by you look stupid.

1389
01:08:58.38 --> 01:08:59.38
Yeah, you look dumb.

1390
01:08:59.38 --> 01:09:01.38
Yeah, so that's the message to convey to your kids.

1391
01:09:01.38 --> 01:09:03.38
Yeah, losing your temper is stupid.

1392
01:09:03.38 --> 01:09:06.38
Yeah, and man, some people there, they,

1393
01:09:06.38 --> 01:09:08.38
you could tell they say that stuff with a little bit of pride.

1394
01:09:08.38 --> 01:09:11.38
And let's just mean my temper going to be like, my temper is going to get me in trouble.

1395
01:09:11.38 --> 01:09:13.38
And they're all like, yeah, you're not proud.

1396
01:09:13.38 --> 01:09:14.38
I'm a hothead, man.

1397
01:09:14.38 --> 01:09:16.38
That's like, don't mean that should be the guy.

1398
01:09:16.38 --> 01:09:18.38
Yeah, I know you, I wish I didn't.

1399
01:09:18.38 --> 01:09:20.38
That should be, if you say, I just have a temper,

1400
01:09:20.38 --> 01:09:22.38
that should be the equivalent of you saying,

1401
01:09:22.38 --> 01:09:24.38
I don't know how to read.

1402
01:09:24.38 --> 01:09:26.38
It should be that, hey, nothing wrong with it.

1403
01:09:26.38 --> 01:09:28.38
You can get past it and, you know, whatever,

1404
01:09:28.38 --> 01:09:30.38
I'm not going to judge you for it, but it's not good.

1405
01:09:30.38 --> 01:09:32.38
It's not a good state to be in.

1406
01:09:32.38 --> 01:09:34.38
Do you, someone who can't control your temper.

1407
01:09:34.38 --> 01:09:36.38
Just like it's not a good state to be in as a grown adult,

1408
01:09:36.38 --> 01:09:40.38
to not not to read no judgment, but just solve that problem.

1409
01:09:40.38 --> 01:09:41.38
That's it.

1410
01:09:41.38 --> 01:09:46.38
Be, if you're having, like, if your kids have a temper,

1411
01:09:46.38 --> 01:09:50.38
and they're easy to anger, it's because chances are,

1412
01:09:50.38 --> 01:09:53.38
I don't know, everybody, of course, but chances are,

1413
01:09:53.38 --> 01:09:55.38
they got it from the parents.

1414
01:09:55.38 --> 01:09:57.38
Keep in mind, you're one of those parents.

1415
01:09:57.38 --> 01:10:01.38
I'm not saying, I'm not saying that you have a temper.

1416
01:10:01.38 --> 01:10:05.38
I'm not saying you don't, but I am saying, sure.

1417
01:10:05.38 --> 01:10:06.38
You can't have a temper.

1418
01:10:06.38 --> 01:10:07.38
You're wife as a temper.

1419
01:10:07.38 --> 01:10:09.38
You got it really, honestly,

1420
01:10:09.38 --> 01:10:11.38
evaluate, do I have the temper?

1421
01:10:11.38 --> 01:10:12.38
And understand that.

1422
01:10:12.38 --> 01:10:16.38
Because the kids, they're just these little seeds of beings.

1423
01:10:16.38 --> 01:10:18.38
We're like, hey, how do I act?

1424
01:10:18.38 --> 01:10:19.38
I don't know how to act.

1425
01:10:19.38 --> 01:10:21.38
I'll act out, you know, just how I'm going to cry.

1426
01:10:21.38 --> 01:10:22.38
This is my default.

1427
01:10:22.38 --> 01:10:24.38
I'm just going to cry when something's wrong.

1428
01:10:24.38 --> 01:10:26.38
So you're saying if the parents have a temper and show that,

1429
01:10:26.38 --> 01:10:27.38
and act that way, the kids will learn it.

1430
01:10:27.38 --> 01:10:28.38
You're going to learn it.

1431
01:10:28.38 --> 01:10:31.38
So there's something like genetic, though.

1432
01:10:31.38 --> 01:10:32.38
I, well, maybe I guess it could.

1433
01:10:32.38 --> 01:10:34.38
We don't know if it's genetic or not, but there's some,

1434
01:10:34.38 --> 01:10:38.38
we know the father has a bad temper, and then the kid has a bad temper.

1435
01:10:38.38 --> 01:10:40.38
Yeah, but there's no temper gene.

1436
01:10:40.38 --> 01:10:45.38
So what it is is there's a genetic situation for sure that you're more apt

1437
01:10:45.38 --> 01:10:50.38
to not be able to control certain parts of, or not not be able to control,

1438
01:10:50.38 --> 01:10:52.38
but control less.

1439
01:10:52.38 --> 01:10:56.38
You know, certain parts of your brain or chemistry is going to make you lean towards

1440
01:10:56.38 --> 01:11:00.38
certain types of behavior, like impulsive behavior or something like that.

1441
01:11:00.38 --> 01:11:02.38
There is that for sure.

1442
01:11:02.38 --> 01:11:06.38
But again, man, when you're kid, you're just looking for,

1443
01:11:06.38 --> 01:11:07.38
how do I act?

1444
01:11:07.38 --> 01:11:08.38
I don't know.

1445
01:11:08.38 --> 01:11:09.38
I'm growing up.

1446
01:11:09.38 --> 01:11:10.38
I don't even know how to act.

1447
01:11:10.38 --> 01:11:12.38
So the first thing you're going to look at is the people,

1448
01:11:12.38 --> 01:11:14.38
what the authority figures in front of you.

1449
01:11:14.38 --> 01:11:15.38
The parents.

1450
01:11:15.38 --> 01:11:16.38
If the parents aren't there, who are they looking to?

1451
01:11:16.38 --> 01:11:19.38
I don't know the guy next door, the guy in TV, the guy up the street,

1452
01:11:19.38 --> 01:11:21.38
the guy in the music video, whoever.

1453
01:11:21.38 --> 01:11:23.38
I don't know whoever's doing better than me.

1454
01:11:23.38 --> 01:11:24.38
That's it.

1455
01:11:24.38 --> 01:11:29.38
So if you're the parent, and you're losing your temper all the time,

1456
01:11:29.38 --> 01:11:30.38
kids can lose their temper.

1457
01:11:30.38 --> 01:11:32.38
That's how what they're going to learn how to act.

1458
01:11:32.38 --> 01:11:34.38
So point there is.

1459
01:11:34.38 --> 01:11:40.38
If you lose your temper or if your kids are losing your temper,

1460
01:11:40.38 --> 01:11:46.38
we start with yourself because you know the guy in.

1461
01:11:46.38 --> 01:11:49.38
You know the guy in there's certain things that's real easy to see when someone else

1462
01:11:49.38 --> 01:11:50.38
does it?

1463
01:11:50.38 --> 01:11:51.38
Yeah, most things.

1464
01:11:51.38 --> 01:11:54.38
But yeah, but it's really, yeah, you simply don't see it.

1465
01:11:54.38 --> 01:11:56.38
Sounds like this guy here that asks this question.

1466
01:11:56.38 --> 01:11:58.38
He's saying his wife loses his temper.

1467
01:11:58.38 --> 01:12:02.38
And that could be where the kid is getting the modeling from.

1468
01:12:02.38 --> 01:12:03.38
Right.

1469
01:12:03.38 --> 01:12:04.38
And he's saying he doesn't.

1470
01:12:04.38 --> 01:12:06.38
Now is there a chance that he does too?

1471
01:12:06.38 --> 01:12:07.38
I guess so.

1472
01:12:07.38 --> 01:12:09.38
But it sounds like he's pretty together and he's saying,

1473
01:12:09.38 --> 01:12:11.38
look, I just need to get him to calm down.

1474
01:12:11.38 --> 01:12:11.38
Right.

1475
01:12:11.38 --> 01:12:13.38
So yeah.

1476
01:12:13.38 --> 01:12:16.38
In this situation, I'd say it's probably the wife who's losing her temper

1477
01:12:16.38 --> 01:12:19.38
and then the kid is imitating or modeling.

1478
01:12:19.38 --> 01:12:21.38
And then we have this scenario happening.

1479
01:12:21.38 --> 01:12:22.38
Yeah.

1480
01:12:22.38 --> 01:12:24.38
So what we need to do is explain to everyone in the family that.

1481
01:12:24.38 --> 01:12:25.38
It's not good.

1482
01:12:25.38 --> 01:12:26.38
We're not losing our temper anymore.

1483
01:12:26.38 --> 01:12:27.38
Yeah.

1484
01:12:27.38 --> 01:12:30.38
And the reason I say it to is again, I'm not saying he does lose his temper.

1485
01:12:30.38 --> 01:12:34.38
But I am saying that it is a possibility that because if let's say

1486
01:12:34.38 --> 01:12:37.38
me and your husband and wife and you lose your temper.

1487
01:12:37.38 --> 01:12:39.38
I won't just gross.

1488
01:12:39.38 --> 01:12:40.38
Yeah.

1489
01:12:40.38 --> 01:12:42.38
But we're in a little bit like that.

1490
01:12:42.38 --> 01:12:45.38
Just look at me and my wife.

1491
01:12:45.38 --> 01:12:46.38
Okay.

1492
01:12:46.38 --> 01:12:49.38
If she loses the temper, her temper.

1493
01:12:49.38 --> 01:12:54.38
And I'm taking the direct approach, right?

1494
01:12:54.38 --> 01:12:55.38
Yeah.

1495
01:12:55.38 --> 01:12:56.38
Which I understand now.

1496
01:12:56.38 --> 01:12:58.38
I'm going to lose my temper back.

1497
01:12:58.38 --> 01:12:59.38
I'm going to go fire.

1498
01:12:59.38 --> 01:13:00.38
I'm going to fire with fire.

1499
01:13:00.38 --> 01:13:01.38
You raise your voice.

1500
01:13:01.38 --> 01:13:02.38
I'm going to raise my voice.

1501
01:13:02.38 --> 01:13:03.38
The kids over there in the corner.

1502
01:13:03.38 --> 01:13:04.38
How do I act?

1503
01:13:04.38 --> 01:13:05.38
That's how I act right there.

1504
01:13:05.38 --> 01:13:06.38
That's a possibility.

1505
01:13:06.38 --> 01:13:08.38
And kids will become anti-social.

1506
01:13:08.38 --> 01:13:09.38
That's the thing.

1507
01:13:09.38 --> 01:13:10.38
Goes on.

1508
01:13:10.38 --> 01:13:11.38
It's one of the things.

1509
01:13:11.38 --> 01:13:12.38
One of the many things.

1510
01:13:12.38 --> 01:13:13.38
Anti-social.

1511
01:13:13.38 --> 01:13:16.38
I told you about that book called Mind Games.

1512
01:13:16.38 --> 01:13:17.38
Small little book.

1513
01:13:17.38 --> 01:13:19.38
Forget the author.

1514
01:13:19.38 --> 01:13:25.38
It's like pretty clearly and concisely laid out if you have angry issues.

1515
01:13:25.38 --> 01:13:26.38
Like what up with that?

1516
01:13:26.38 --> 01:13:27.38
It's integrative.

1517
01:13:27.38 --> 01:13:28.38
Change my whole life.

1518
01:13:28.38 --> 01:13:29.38
Low self-esteem.

1519
01:13:29.38 --> 01:13:32.38
Next question.

1520
01:13:32.38 --> 01:13:33.38
Next question.

1521
01:13:33.38 --> 01:13:34.38
Unless you want to go on.

1522
01:13:34.38 --> 01:13:35.38
No.

1523
01:13:35.38 --> 01:13:36.38
Next question.

1524
01:13:36.38 --> 01:13:37.38
Okay.

1525
01:13:37.38 --> 01:13:47.38
Joko will take tactics to flank slash shift a ferocious analyzer from paralysis to go.

1526
01:13:47.38 --> 01:13:50.38
Meaning something over things.

1527
01:13:50.38 --> 01:13:51.38
Yeah.

1528
01:13:51.38 --> 01:13:52.38
It's over things.

1529
01:13:52.38 --> 01:13:53.38
Has the taste of landing and planning and planning and planning?

1530
01:13:53.38 --> 01:13:55.38
Well, there's a couple of things here.

1531
01:13:55.38 --> 01:13:58.38
The person is above you or below you in the chain of command.

1532
01:13:58.38 --> 01:14:01.38
So if they're below you in the chain of command, you explain to them.

1533
01:14:01.38 --> 01:14:03.38
You say, look, we don't need perfection.

1534
01:14:03.38 --> 01:14:04.38
We're not going to have 100% solution.

1535
01:14:04.38 --> 01:14:06.38
We don't have 100% of the information.

1536
01:14:06.38 --> 01:14:08.38
That's a good enough solution.

1537
01:14:08.38 --> 01:14:09.38
We need to move forward.

1538
01:14:09.38 --> 01:14:10.38
Let's execute.

1539
01:14:10.38 --> 01:14:11.38
And you know what?

1540
01:14:11.38 --> 01:14:12.38
I'll take everything.

1541
01:14:12.38 --> 01:14:13.38
Things go wrong.

1542
01:14:13.38 --> 01:14:14.38
Don't worry about it.

1543
01:14:14.38 --> 01:14:15.38
I'll take responsibility for it.

1544
01:14:15.38 --> 01:14:16.38
I'm not going to blame you.

1545
01:14:16.38 --> 01:14:17.38
That's a good leader.

1546
01:14:17.38 --> 01:14:18.38
So that's what you're going to do if you're there.

1547
01:14:18.38 --> 01:14:20.38
Below you in the chain of command.

1548
01:14:20.38 --> 01:14:24.38
If they're above you in the chain of command, yes, what?

1549
01:14:24.38 --> 01:14:25.38
Same thing.

1550
01:14:25.38 --> 01:14:29.38
You're going to tell the same thing like, hey, boss, we don't need perfection here.

1551
01:14:29.38 --> 01:14:31.38
Look, boss, we're not going to get all the information.

1552
01:14:31.38 --> 01:14:33.38
We need, we're not going to get 100% solution.

1553
01:14:33.38 --> 01:14:35.38
We've got a 90% solution.

1554
01:14:35.38 --> 01:14:37.38
And let's go for it.

1555
01:14:37.38 --> 01:14:40.38
And if things do go wrong, you can blame me.

1556
01:14:40.38 --> 01:14:41.38
I don't care.

1557
01:14:41.38 --> 01:14:42.38
So boom.

1558
01:14:42.38 --> 01:14:46.34
Whether they're above you or below you in the chain of command, you might change your

1559
01:14:46.34 --> 01:14:50.34
tact or your furniture a little bit, but it's the same same overall concept.

1560
01:14:50.34 --> 01:14:52.54
You've got to get them to understand that we don't need perfection.

1561
01:14:52.54 --> 01:14:54.02
We need to move forward.

1562
01:14:54.02 --> 01:14:57.22
And the other thing is you explain the cost of not moving.

1563
01:14:57.22 --> 01:15:02.54
The cost of staying still, the cost of being reactive and set of proactive, in basically

1564
01:15:02.54 --> 01:15:04.70
the cost of not being aggressive.

1565
01:15:04.70 --> 01:15:06.78
Because that's what we're talking about as a lack of aggression.

1566
01:15:06.78 --> 01:15:07.98
And so what does that look like?

1567
01:15:07.98 --> 01:15:15.14
Will you explain to them that the longer we sit, the better position the enemy gets into?

1568
01:15:15.14 --> 01:15:22.30
If a longer we wait, the less we know about what is actually happening.

1569
01:15:22.30 --> 01:15:23.46
Think about that one.

1570
01:15:23.46 --> 01:15:26.90
The more you sit here and you're planning, the less we know what's going on out there.

1571
01:15:26.90 --> 01:15:28.06
The things are happening.

1572
01:15:28.06 --> 01:15:29.06
They're changing.

1573
01:15:29.06 --> 01:15:30.06
They're evolving.

1574
01:15:30.06 --> 01:15:31.46
The enemy is maneuvering.

1575
01:15:31.46 --> 01:15:34.74
There's developments on the battlefield or in the marketplace and you don't even know

1576
01:15:34.74 --> 01:15:37.66
because you're sitting in the planning space.

1577
01:15:37.66 --> 01:15:43.34
The longer we wait, the less time we have to recover if something does go wrong.

1578
01:15:43.34 --> 01:15:50.70
So if we sit here and plan for 47 days and on the 48th day we start to execute and something

1579
01:15:50.70 --> 01:15:55.58
goes wrong, we're not going to make the 50 day mark because we spend all that time planning.

1580
01:15:55.58 --> 01:15:58.78
So the longer that you're sitting around, the less time you have to recover and adapt

1581
01:15:58.78 --> 01:15:59.78
than adjust.

1582
01:15:59.78 --> 01:16:04.30
And the longer that you wait while you're doing planning, the less relevant your plan

1583
01:16:04.30 --> 01:16:06.86
actually becomes.

1584
01:16:06.86 --> 01:16:10.10
So that's what you need to make people understand.

1585
01:16:10.10 --> 01:16:17.10
And then there's people that are just habitual and chronic ferocious analyzers and those

1586
01:16:17.10 --> 01:16:21.02
of the people you've got to watch, but you've got to continually just get through their head

1587
01:16:21.02 --> 01:16:24.42
that the more we sit, the more the enemy maneuvers.

1588
01:16:24.42 --> 01:16:28.78
And if we let them maneuver on us anymore, we're going to get killed.

1589
01:16:28.78 --> 01:16:29.78
That's it.

1590
01:16:29.78 --> 01:16:30.78
Pretty easy.

1591
01:16:30.78 --> 01:16:31.78
It's not easy.

1592
01:16:31.78 --> 01:16:32.78
It's a simple concept.

1593
01:16:32.78 --> 01:16:34.30
It's hard to get people out of their own heads.

1594
01:16:34.30 --> 01:16:40.02
Just like this, like everything else, it's hard for the ferocious analyzer to record

1595
01:16:40.02 --> 01:16:41.02
nice themselves.

1596
01:16:41.02 --> 01:16:43.94
As that, they think they're doing a good job.

1597
01:16:43.94 --> 01:16:47.94
They think they're actually being thorough and you're a wild man, you're a cowboy.

1598
01:16:47.94 --> 01:16:48.94
Are you crazy?

1599
01:16:48.94 --> 01:16:50.94
No, I'm not crazy.

1600
01:16:50.94 --> 01:16:54.66
Every one time my first deployment to Iraq, they said, hey John, this is after I've

1601
01:16:54.66 --> 01:16:58.74
been there for a while and they wanted for some reason they wanted to know the minimum

1602
01:16:58.74 --> 01:17:01.70
requirements for us to go out on an operation.

1603
01:17:01.70 --> 01:17:06.86
And I said, I just need a vicinity of the target and of radio frequency to talk to the

1604
01:17:06.86 --> 01:17:09.70
local conventional units there.

1605
01:17:09.70 --> 01:17:12.06
And they were like, well, don't you need air support, but you can't say all these other

1606
01:17:12.06 --> 01:17:14.66
things, I was like, no, we'll figure it out.

1607
01:17:14.66 --> 01:17:16.30
Just send us.

1608
01:17:16.30 --> 01:17:17.30
Yeah.

1609
01:17:17.30 --> 01:17:18.30
We'll go.

1610
01:17:18.30 --> 01:17:20.98
And there was other things that we would do as we'd move to a target.

1611
01:17:20.98 --> 01:17:24.22
We'd align things up and we'd be good.

1612
01:17:24.22 --> 01:17:27.38
But sometimes people wanted to plan out every last detail.

1613
01:17:27.38 --> 01:17:28.38
And that doesn't work.

1614
01:17:28.38 --> 01:17:30.22
The details are not going to stay the same.

1615
01:17:30.22 --> 01:17:32.82
The things that you're planning on are going to change.

1616
01:17:32.82 --> 01:17:35.82
So don't sit there and plan every last detail because it's not going to help you.

1617
01:17:35.82 --> 01:17:38.22
Man, that's actually a pretty good plan.

1618
01:17:38.22 --> 01:17:42.30
I don't even thought about how you say if you spend too much time planning, you know,

1619
01:17:42.30 --> 01:17:44.10
and then you jump in the game all late.

1620
01:17:44.10 --> 01:17:46.14
It's like, dang, you have no time to make any adjustments.

1621
01:17:46.14 --> 01:17:47.14
Carry out.

1622
01:17:47.14 --> 01:17:49.38
You better go perfect because that's all.

1623
01:17:49.38 --> 01:17:50.62
That's the one shot you got at it.

1624
01:17:50.62 --> 01:17:51.62
Guess what?

1625
01:17:51.62 --> 01:17:54.02
It's not going to go perfect because things don't go perfect.

1626
01:17:54.02 --> 01:17:55.22
Things are not going to go perfect.

1627
01:17:55.22 --> 01:17:56.22
Not going to happen.

1628
01:17:56.22 --> 01:17:59.74
No such thing as flawless execution, Dave Burke just wrote an article that was on business

1629
01:17:59.74 --> 01:18:00.74
insider.

1630
01:18:00.74 --> 01:18:03.54
So what it was, like, for all this execution doesn't happen.

1631
01:18:03.54 --> 01:18:04.54
Yeah.

1632
01:18:04.54 --> 01:18:12.62
That top gun senior instructor for three years, he knows about flying and he knows how hard

1633
01:18:12.62 --> 01:18:16.34
they worked towards flawless execution, but it didn't exist.

1634
01:18:16.34 --> 01:18:22.06
The flawless execution was analyzing their mistakes, seeing what they can improve upon.

1635
01:18:22.06 --> 01:18:24.26
That was the flawless execution for them.

1636
01:18:24.26 --> 01:18:27.06
It wasn't the actual act of flawless execution.

1637
01:18:27.06 --> 01:18:30.14
That you know what they had for all this debriefing.

1638
01:18:30.14 --> 01:18:32.62
Flawless analyzation of what they did wrong.

1639
01:18:32.62 --> 01:18:33.62
Yeah.

1640
01:18:33.62 --> 01:18:34.62
It's going to be perfect option.

1641
01:18:34.62 --> 01:18:35.62
It doesn't go such thing.

1642
01:18:35.62 --> 01:18:36.62
Doesn't happen.

1643
01:18:36.62 --> 01:18:37.62
Yeah.

1644
01:18:37.62 --> 01:18:39.98
So if you're sitting and planning that, trying to make that happen, it's not going to work

1645
01:18:39.98 --> 01:18:40.98
for you.

1646
01:18:40.98 --> 01:18:41.98
Yeah.

1647
01:18:41.98 --> 01:18:42.98
So don't do it.

1648
01:18:42.98 --> 01:18:43.98
Just jump.

1649
01:18:43.98 --> 01:18:45.98
Just go.

1650
01:18:45.98 --> 01:18:47.98
Next question.

1651
01:18:47.98 --> 01:18:49.98
Joko got a question.

1652
01:18:49.98 --> 01:18:51.46
He actually wrote that.

1653
01:18:51.46 --> 01:18:52.46
Yeah, he did.

1654
01:18:52.46 --> 01:18:54.18
He's fully in the game.

1655
01:18:54.18 --> 01:18:56.46
He got a question.

1656
01:18:56.46 --> 01:19:01.42
How would you do with a team member who tries to take all the responsibility, but cannot

1657
01:19:01.42 --> 01:19:04.30
do his good job as others?

1658
01:19:04.30 --> 01:19:10.06
I don't know if it's sincere, helpfulness or desire of power.

1659
01:19:10.06 --> 01:19:11.06
These are four power.

1660
01:19:11.06 --> 01:19:12.06
Ooh.

1661
01:19:12.06 --> 01:19:13.46
See, there's a little twist on that one.

1662
01:19:13.46 --> 01:19:14.46
Yeah.

1663
01:19:14.46 --> 01:19:16.34
That little twist that puts them all on that question right there.

1664
01:19:16.34 --> 01:19:19.78
So you got a guy that's trying to take all this responsibility for everything.

1665
01:19:19.78 --> 01:19:21.38
And how really is good is he should be?

1666
01:19:21.38 --> 01:19:22.38
Do he in that position?

1667
01:19:22.38 --> 01:19:23.98
But trying to take responsibility.

1668
01:19:23.98 --> 01:19:29.42
And yet the person that's got the question, he doesn't know if it's sincere, trying

1669
01:19:29.42 --> 01:19:32.50
to just help out the team or a desire for power.

1670
01:19:32.50 --> 01:19:37.34
So is it helpfulness or is it their quest for power?

1671
01:19:37.34 --> 01:19:38.34
Where are they coming from?

1672
01:19:38.34 --> 01:19:40.30
How do we figure that out?

1673
01:19:40.30 --> 01:19:47.02
Well, for one thing, if someone is truly trying to help the team, they will have an open

1674
01:19:47.02 --> 01:19:53.94
mind to support and suggestion and help from other people, they'll be open to that.

1675
01:19:53.94 --> 01:19:56.74
Because they're just trying to do the best for the team.

1676
01:19:56.74 --> 01:20:03.06
If they're trying to take or maintain power, which as we know is driven by ego, there

1677
01:20:03.06 --> 01:20:05.46
you don't want help.

1678
01:20:05.46 --> 01:20:07.94
And they don't want suggestions from people either.

1679
01:20:07.94 --> 01:20:10.02
They're just going to do it my way.

1680
01:20:10.02 --> 01:20:11.02
I got this.

1681
01:20:11.02 --> 01:20:12.02
No, it's mine.

1682
01:20:12.02 --> 01:20:14.26
So that's the difference.

1683
01:20:14.26 --> 01:20:16.94
So there's going to be two different ways that I'm going to handle with this situation.

1684
01:20:16.94 --> 01:20:20.14
So for a person that's actually trying to help and trying to do a good job, I'm going to

1685
01:20:20.14 --> 01:20:21.30
bolster them up.

1686
01:20:21.30 --> 01:20:22.62
I love it.

1687
01:20:22.62 --> 01:20:24.30
The fact that they have some shortfalls, that's okay.

1688
01:20:24.30 --> 01:20:26.90
I'm going to give them some support.

1689
01:20:26.90 --> 01:20:32.26
I'm going to put some people on their team that can help cover some of those shortfalls.

1690
01:20:32.26 --> 01:20:40.98
I'm going to try and set them up to win and learn and be educated while they are winning.

1691
01:20:40.98 --> 01:20:46.82
And if they're humble, which I'm assuming that they are because they have this attitude

1692
01:20:46.82 --> 01:20:51.10
that they're trying to help out everyone, then while I'm doing this whole process, of

1693
01:20:51.10 --> 01:20:56.06
course, coach them and I'm going to give them suggestions and I'm turning to someone

1694
01:20:56.06 --> 01:20:58.94
that can do a good job in that situation.

1695
01:20:58.94 --> 01:21:00.34
So that's pretty easy.

1696
01:21:00.34 --> 01:21:02.74
You've got somebody that wants to take ownership of your responsibility and they're doing

1697
01:21:02.74 --> 01:21:03.74
it for the right reasons.

1698
01:21:03.74 --> 01:21:05.66
Boom, let's help them out with support them.

1699
01:21:05.66 --> 01:21:06.66
Let's get them training.

1700
01:21:06.66 --> 01:21:07.82
Let's get them knowledge and let's get them up to speed.

1701
01:21:07.82 --> 01:21:09.14
We've got a upcoming leader.

1702
01:21:09.14 --> 01:21:11.82
I dig it.

1703
01:21:11.82 --> 01:21:17.82
If it's an ego driven person, and they are maneuvering for the power.

1704
01:21:17.82 --> 01:21:21.74
Well, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to let them get humbled by the experience.

1705
01:21:21.74 --> 01:21:24.98
Because remember, it's stated that they're not as good as they could be at this job.

1706
01:21:24.98 --> 01:21:28.18
They're not particularly good at what they're trying to take control over.

1707
01:21:28.18 --> 01:21:29.18
So that's fine.

1708
01:21:29.18 --> 01:21:30.94
I'm going to let them get humbled by it.

1709
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:32.58
Now I'm going to assess the rest.

1710
01:21:32.58 --> 01:21:36.18
So I'm going to make sure that no one's going to get hurt or no one's going to get killed.

1711
01:21:36.18 --> 01:21:39.74
We're not going to fail a mission or in the business world.

1712
01:21:39.74 --> 01:21:41.78
Make sure they're not going to lose millions of dollars.

1713
01:21:41.78 --> 01:21:42.78
We're not going to suffer.

1714
01:21:42.78 --> 01:21:44.82
Come to some kind of a strategic setback.

1715
01:21:44.82 --> 01:21:49.90
But I am going to let them fail a little bit and let them see that they're not as good

1716
01:21:49.90 --> 01:21:51.54
as they think they are.

1717
01:21:51.54 --> 01:21:54.98
I'm going to let them learn about humility.

1718
01:21:54.98 --> 01:21:55.98
Right.

1719
01:21:55.98 --> 01:21:57.54
I'm going to let them learn about humility.

1720
01:21:57.54 --> 01:22:03.34
Now, if they learn, if they are humbled by that and they realize that they're not as good

1721
01:22:03.34 --> 01:22:06.34
as they realize that they're not ready to control everything and they realize that

1722
01:22:06.34 --> 01:22:07.34
they need help.

1723
01:22:07.34 --> 01:22:11.94
If they learn from it and they don't just cast blame, then they'll become a much better

1724
01:22:11.94 --> 01:22:13.26
leader.

1725
01:22:13.26 --> 01:22:16.14
You will actually help them by letting them get humbled.

1726
01:22:16.14 --> 01:22:25.50
If they just get done and they just cast blame, then we see them fail.

1727
01:22:25.50 --> 01:22:28.38
And now we have legitimate reason to say, look, I can't put you in charge.

1728
01:22:28.38 --> 01:22:29.38
You just failed.

1729
01:22:29.38 --> 01:22:32.02
I can't allow this to happen again.

1730
01:22:32.02 --> 01:22:36.86
So that's how I would basically handle that situation.

1731
01:22:36.86 --> 01:22:42.26
Now, of course, there's all different kind of gradations of those realities.

1732
01:22:42.26 --> 01:22:45.10
And the answer will be somewhat scaled as well.

1733
01:22:45.10 --> 01:22:46.66
So, you do that's what you do.

1734
01:22:46.66 --> 01:22:47.66
You scale the answer.

1735
01:22:47.66 --> 01:22:49.94
Maybe you can first of all, a little bit of help, but you're going to let them stumble a

1736
01:22:49.94 --> 01:22:50.94
little bit.

1737
01:22:50.94 --> 01:22:53.82
You know, maybe you're not going to give them any help at all.

1738
01:22:53.82 --> 01:22:55.62
You're going to fall and fight on their face.

1739
01:22:55.62 --> 01:22:58.66
Maybe you're going to bolster them up a lot, but you're still going to talk to them and

1740
01:22:58.66 --> 01:23:02.82
say, hey, listen, you need to step back and get more in the weeds on some of the lower

1741
01:23:02.82 --> 01:23:04.86
level stuff, because you're not ready to manage this yet.

1742
01:23:04.86 --> 01:23:11.30
You know, so it's cool, but that's my basic overall concept of where I would be going with

1743
01:23:11.30 --> 01:23:12.30
that.

1744
01:23:12.30 --> 01:23:19.94
Do you find that, like, even with the expression extreme ownership or, in this case,

1745
01:23:19.94 --> 01:23:28.54
paid with all the responsibility, do you find that not people get confused, but, you know,

1746
01:23:28.54 --> 01:23:30.54
yeah, like people will kind of get confused.

1747
01:23:30.54 --> 01:23:34.38
You know how you say, okay, take responsibility, because it seems like anyway, from what

1748
01:23:34.38 --> 01:23:38.02
I told think I told Anderson with extreme ownership is here.

1749
01:23:38.02 --> 01:23:41.54
I like it, I like where I come from.

1750
01:23:41.54 --> 01:23:49.94
You take responsibility for the mistakes and the solution.

1751
01:23:49.94 --> 01:23:52.30
Yes, that is a dream ownership.

1752
01:23:52.30 --> 01:23:56.54
So, and then, but then it, from what I heard, like sometimes when people ask questions,

1753
01:23:56.54 --> 01:24:01.06
it'll kind of, but this one's kind of ambiguous, but sometimes people ask it, ask a question

1754
01:24:01.06 --> 01:24:06.98
or make a statement comment, whatever, in terms of take responsibility or take ownership

1755
01:24:06.98 --> 01:24:14.14
of, like, not of the problems or the solutions, but like before the mission, like, this

1756
01:24:14.14 --> 01:24:15.14
is my mission.

1757
01:24:15.14 --> 01:24:20.02
Yes, this is my, you can overstep, you can be, you can use too much extreme ownership,

1758
01:24:20.02 --> 01:24:24.70
you can say, hey, this is my mission, I'll tell you how to do it.

1759
01:24:24.70 --> 01:24:25.70
Now, you know, I'm pushing for me.

1760
01:24:25.70 --> 01:24:26.70
No, I'm pushing for me.

1761
01:24:26.70 --> 01:24:27.70
You can follow me.

1762
01:24:27.70 --> 01:24:28.70
Yep.

1763
01:24:28.70 --> 01:24:29.98
And by the way, I'm taking all the credit, too.

1764
01:24:29.98 --> 01:24:32.22
And we get back, which is actually equally wrong.

1765
01:24:32.22 --> 01:24:33.22
Right.

1766
01:24:33.22 --> 01:24:34.22
Right.

1767
01:24:34.22 --> 01:24:38.38
I will echo, I'm in charge of this, but hey, man, I want you to come up with a good

1768
01:24:38.38 --> 01:24:39.38
plan.

1769
01:24:39.38 --> 01:24:40.38
I think you've got a great insight.

1770
01:24:40.38 --> 01:24:41.38
I think you know the terrain better than me.

1771
01:24:41.38 --> 01:24:42.66
Can you come up with a good plan?

1772
01:24:42.66 --> 01:24:44.30
And then we get backwards.

1773
01:24:44.30 --> 01:24:46.86
If it's a successful mission, I'm like, hey, guys, everyone look what Echo did and I

1774
01:24:46.86 --> 01:24:50.06
tell the Command Officer, Echo ran this great operation.

1775
01:24:50.06 --> 01:24:51.78
I think he's ready to step up and leadership.

1776
01:24:51.78 --> 01:24:53.82
He really did a superb job.

1777
01:24:53.82 --> 01:24:56.26
If it fails, what am I doing?

1778
01:24:56.26 --> 01:24:57.26
Pointing the finger echo?

1779
01:24:57.26 --> 01:24:59.98
No, I'm coming back and saying, hey, boss, here's a mission failure.

1780
01:24:59.98 --> 01:25:01.30
These are mistakes I made.

1781
01:25:01.30 --> 01:25:02.30
Here's what I did wrong.

1782
01:25:02.30 --> 01:25:03.58
Here's what I'm gonna fix next time.

1783
01:25:03.58 --> 01:25:04.58
Real symbols.

1784
01:25:04.58 --> 01:25:11.74
So would you say, in a nutshell, extreme ownership applies to problems and the solutions

1785
01:25:11.74 --> 01:25:13.50
to those problems and that's all.

1786
01:25:13.50 --> 01:25:15.66
No, it applies to everything.

1787
01:25:15.66 --> 01:25:19.30
It applies to everything because even when I say, hey, Echo, I want you to come

1788
01:25:19.30 --> 01:25:20.82
up with a plan for this.

1789
01:25:20.82 --> 01:25:22.90
You come back and brief me with a plan.

1790
01:25:22.90 --> 01:25:24.86
I still take ownership of the plan.

1791
01:25:24.86 --> 01:25:28.02
It's your plan, but I go through it and I say, okay, this looks like a good move.

1792
01:25:28.02 --> 01:25:29.02
Hey, Echo.

1793
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:30.02
I'm looking at this right here.

1794
01:25:30.02 --> 01:25:31.78
I don't know if this is the best way to execute this.

1795
01:25:31.78 --> 01:25:32.78
Right.

1796
01:25:32.78 --> 01:25:35.62
I'm not taking ownership of it.

1797
01:25:35.62 --> 01:25:40.10
That I'm pulling it away from you, but I'm definitely gonna make sure we win.

1798
01:25:40.10 --> 01:25:45.42
That's the thing that drives me crazy sometimes with leaders is they don't realize it,

1799
01:25:45.42 --> 01:25:46.66
but they're making excuses.

1800
01:25:46.66 --> 01:25:50.06
Because they'll say, oh, you know, I let, I'm decentralized command.

1801
01:25:50.06 --> 01:25:51.70
So I can't control everything.

1802
01:25:51.70 --> 01:25:53.94
No, actually, you are responsible for everything.

1803
01:25:53.94 --> 01:25:57.26
And if I got three teams out there and you're one of the team leaders and I come to you

1804
01:25:57.26 --> 01:25:59.94
and say, hey, Echo, here's the plan I want you to execute.

1805
01:25:59.94 --> 01:26:01.54
I still have to look at the plan.

1806
01:26:01.54 --> 01:26:04.38
I still have to make sure that I agree with what you do and have to make sure you're not

1807
01:26:04.38 --> 01:26:06.18
doing something that doesn't make sense.

1808
01:26:06.18 --> 01:26:08.46
So I, yes, I do have ownership of the plan.

1809
01:26:08.46 --> 01:26:09.46
Yeah.

1810
01:26:09.46 --> 01:26:10.46
Absolutely.

1811
01:26:10.46 --> 01:26:12.46
Like it's your family members and things.

1812
01:26:12.46 --> 01:26:13.46
Yeah.

1813
01:26:13.46 --> 01:26:15.46
No, that plan is like it's, I love it like a son.

1814
01:26:15.46 --> 01:26:16.86
Yeah, the plan is the plan.

1815
01:26:16.86 --> 01:26:18.26
You came up with the plan.

1816
01:26:18.26 --> 01:26:19.26
You created it.

1817
01:26:19.26 --> 01:26:20.26
It's my grand kit.

1818
01:26:20.26 --> 01:26:21.26
Yeah, right.

1819
01:26:21.26 --> 01:26:24.98
So it's yours, but I'm still gonna take responsibility and ownership.

1820
01:26:24.98 --> 01:26:25.98
Gotcha.

1821
01:26:25.98 --> 01:26:29.86
But where people, it's when your ego starts flaring up and I start saying, no, it's my plan.

1822
01:26:29.86 --> 01:26:31.26
And where do you, my way?

1823
01:26:31.26 --> 01:26:32.26
Yeah, we have issues.

1824
01:26:32.26 --> 01:26:33.26
Yeah.

1825
01:26:33.26 --> 01:26:37.02
But yeah, the ownership doesn't stop and it just doesn't stop.

1826
01:26:37.02 --> 01:26:38.82
When you're in a leadership position, it doesn't stop.

1827
01:26:38.82 --> 01:26:40.66
When everything, I put down the chain of command.

1828
01:26:40.66 --> 01:26:41.82
It's hard to do.

1829
01:26:41.82 --> 01:26:42.98
It's hard on your ego.

1830
01:26:42.98 --> 01:26:43.98
For sure.

1831
01:26:43.98 --> 01:26:44.98
Yeah.

1832
01:26:44.98 --> 01:26:47.66
Because it kind of seems in a way countering to, I guess if you understand the,

1833
01:26:47.66 --> 01:26:52.22
the little subtle dynamics of it because you know how like, if the plan fails, boom, that's

1834
01:26:52.22 --> 01:26:54.34
one, the extreme ownership is really gonna show it's it.

1835
01:26:54.34 --> 01:27:00.14
But if it's the super successful flawless plan, it doesn't, it's more covert.

1836
01:27:00.14 --> 01:27:03.46
It's more internal because you gotta give the credit for everyone else.

1837
01:27:03.46 --> 01:27:07.58
Everyone will, will sit there and go, oh, Jocco's, you know, he's, he's given the credit

1838
01:27:07.58 --> 01:27:08.82
to echo for the operation.

1839
01:27:08.82 --> 01:27:11.38
You, we won't show up as extreme ownership.

1840
01:27:11.38 --> 01:27:12.38
For sure.

1841
01:27:12.38 --> 01:27:13.38
It'll be harder to see.

1842
01:27:13.38 --> 01:27:14.38
Yeah.

1843
01:27:14.38 --> 01:27:18.94
And people will say, dang, people know that I was in charge, right?

1844
01:27:18.94 --> 01:27:19.94
They don't have me over all of this.

1845
01:27:19.94 --> 01:27:21.46
So I'm still gonna get some credit.

1846
01:27:21.46 --> 01:27:22.46
Right.

1847
01:27:22.46 --> 01:27:23.46
It's more covert.

1848
01:27:23.46 --> 01:27:24.46
But it's way more covert.

1849
01:27:24.46 --> 01:27:25.46
And it's better.

1850
01:27:25.46 --> 01:27:26.46
It's better.

1851
01:27:26.46 --> 01:27:27.46
Right.

1852
01:27:27.46 --> 01:27:28.46
That's the hard thing.

1853
01:27:28.46 --> 01:27:29.46
And they say, that's what's so hard for people to realize.

1854
01:27:29.46 --> 01:27:34.70
They want so bad to raise their hand and say, yes, it was me, it was my, it was my operation.

1855
01:27:34.70 --> 01:27:35.70
But it doesn't help you.

1856
01:27:35.70 --> 01:27:36.98
It doesn't help you.

1857
01:27:36.98 --> 01:27:39.06
It feels good for like half a second.

1858
01:27:39.06 --> 01:27:42.30
And then you realize you just deflated yourself.

1859
01:27:42.30 --> 01:27:46.46
Is that kind of like when you make a donation to charity, but you want like everyone

1860
01:27:46.46 --> 01:27:47.46
to know that you did it.

1861
01:27:47.46 --> 01:27:48.46
It's kind of like that.

1862
01:27:48.46 --> 01:27:49.98
Yeah, I guess it's similar to that.

1863
01:27:49.98 --> 01:27:50.98
Similar concept, right?

1864
01:27:50.98 --> 01:27:53.98
Like in a weird kind of profound way.

1865
01:27:53.98 --> 01:27:54.98
Thanks question.

1866
01:27:54.98 --> 01:27:56.98
I guess we'll just move on to next question.

1867
01:27:56.98 --> 01:27:59.98
That's the profoundness of your last statement.

1868
01:27:59.98 --> 01:28:03.98
Just, you know, on a certain level, it's the same thing.

1869
01:28:03.98 --> 01:28:09.66
Because you did something good, you know, or you are something good or whatever.

1870
01:28:09.66 --> 01:28:13.30
But it's like saying, I'm the most humble guy in the world.

1871
01:28:13.30 --> 01:28:15.34
You know, I'm just super down here.

1872
01:28:15.34 --> 01:28:17.06
Here's the other thing about this.

1873
01:28:17.06 --> 01:28:24.54
When I give you the credit for success, not only do I win covertly in that you look

1874
01:28:24.54 --> 01:28:26.94
in me and go, man, he gave me a couple corrections.

1875
01:28:26.94 --> 01:28:27.94
That worked critical of this operation.

1876
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:29.42
And he's not even saying anything.

1877
01:28:29.42 --> 01:28:33.38
So you have even more respect for me, which means you're going to work harder for me in

1878
01:28:33.38 --> 01:28:34.38
the future.

1879
01:28:34.38 --> 01:28:36.70
You're going to do even more and we're going to look even better.

1880
01:28:36.70 --> 01:28:41.82
So I am going to ultimately win because my team is going to be kicking so much ass all

1881
01:28:41.82 --> 01:28:43.70
over the globe.

1882
01:28:43.70 --> 01:28:48.10
And people are saying, wow, you know, these guys are just winning everywhere they go.

1883
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:50.06
And so it's very, very positive.

1884
01:28:50.06 --> 01:28:56.02
Whereas if I took that credit from you on that first stop operation and I took it from you,

1885
01:28:56.02 --> 01:28:57.86
how hard are you working on that next one?

1886
01:28:57.86 --> 01:28:59.02
Not as hard.

1887
01:28:59.02 --> 01:29:00.02
Not as hard.

1888
01:29:00.02 --> 01:29:01.90
You know, maybe you're a great guy.

1889
01:29:01.90 --> 01:29:02.90
Maybe you're a great guy.

1890
01:29:02.90 --> 01:29:07.30
But you're just a great guy, but you're still not going to go that extra little edge.

1891
01:29:07.30 --> 01:29:09.78
You're not going to do it because you're not going to get credit and you're not going

1892
01:29:09.78 --> 01:29:12.82
to do it because you don't care that much about making me look good.

1893
01:29:12.82 --> 01:29:17.42
As you would if I was taking care of you, there's nothing better than having guys that

1894
01:29:17.42 --> 01:29:18.42
you're taking care of.

1895
01:29:18.42 --> 01:29:20.50
They know you're taking care of them.

1896
01:29:20.50 --> 01:29:21.90
And they're going to do anything for you.

1897
01:29:21.90 --> 01:29:22.90
But they're going to do anything.

1898
01:29:22.90 --> 01:29:26.18
And you'll do anything for them.

1899
01:29:26.18 --> 01:29:27.18
It's a mutual thing.

1900
01:29:27.18 --> 01:29:28.18
It's real.

1901
01:29:28.18 --> 01:29:29.18
It's a real thing.

1902
01:29:29.18 --> 01:29:34.30
It's like they can get the keeps on getting ready.

1903
01:29:34.30 --> 01:29:35.30
It is.

1904
01:29:35.30 --> 01:29:36.30
It's powerful too.

1905
01:29:36.30 --> 01:29:38.22
That's why the book's been so popular.

1906
01:29:38.22 --> 01:29:45.82
And it's why the book's been so popular because when you break it down and people see what

1907
01:29:45.82 --> 01:29:48.66
it does, they realize how powerful it is.

1908
01:29:48.66 --> 01:29:54.14
And it's also another reason that the book is so popular is because we put it in a very

1909
01:29:54.14 --> 01:29:55.78
clear way.

1910
01:29:55.78 --> 01:29:57.90
And it's easier to understand.

1911
01:29:57.90 --> 01:30:01.82
It doesn't make it easier to execute, but it makes it easier to understand.

1912
01:30:01.82 --> 01:30:02.82
For sure.

1913
01:30:02.82 --> 01:30:03.82
Yeah.

1914
01:30:03.82 --> 01:30:04.82
It's crazy too.

1915
01:30:04.82 --> 01:30:08.26
And someone said, I might have been someone at the master.

1916
01:30:08.26 --> 01:30:09.26
I don't know.

1917
01:30:09.26 --> 01:30:10.42
Could have very little been on Twitter.

1918
01:30:10.42 --> 01:30:11.42
I don't know.

1919
01:30:11.42 --> 01:30:14.90
But, oh, someone was saying how it's so interesting.

1920
01:30:14.90 --> 01:30:19.42
They started to realize that it applies to their relationship with their husband or

1921
01:30:19.42 --> 01:30:20.42
wife.

1922
01:30:20.42 --> 01:30:22.42
I appreciate that.

1923
01:30:22.42 --> 01:30:26.26
And I always kind of look at all this stuff as primarily that.

1924
01:30:26.26 --> 01:30:27.26
Because I mean, who do I?

1925
01:30:27.26 --> 01:30:29.06
Especially now, who do I work with?

1926
01:30:29.06 --> 01:30:30.06
You.

1927
01:30:30.06 --> 01:30:31.06
Yeah.

1928
01:30:31.06 --> 01:30:34.34
I don't have to like, I don't go through these extreme ownership struggles.

1929
01:30:34.34 --> 01:30:35.66
You know, with you.

1930
01:30:35.66 --> 01:30:36.66
So it's more, you know.

1931
01:30:36.66 --> 01:30:39.78
So to me, everything I've just applied is to like your relationship with your wife.

1932
01:30:39.78 --> 01:30:40.78
My wife.

1933
01:30:40.78 --> 01:30:41.78
Whatever.

1934
01:30:41.78 --> 01:30:43.10
So and it all translates.

1935
01:30:43.10 --> 01:30:44.10
All of it.

1936
01:30:44.10 --> 01:30:44.86
It does.

1937
01:30:44.86 --> 01:30:47.02
You take ownership of stuff.

1938
01:30:47.02 --> 01:30:50.46
It's when you take ownership of stuff, then you can control the outcome.

1939
01:30:50.46 --> 01:30:51.46
Yeah, it's crazy.

1940
01:30:51.46 --> 01:30:53.42
No, no, no, no, you don't get anywhere.

1941
01:30:53.42 --> 01:30:54.42
Yeah.

1942
01:30:54.42 --> 01:31:00.70
And that, you know, you have a, I don't know, disagreement, any, any ripples in the water

1943
01:31:00.70 --> 01:31:04.42
where the instinct is to point fingers, you know.

1944
01:31:04.42 --> 01:31:07.66
But when you even know what other person is really in the grand scheme of things, you're

1945
01:31:07.66 --> 01:31:08.66
both to blame.

1946
01:31:08.66 --> 01:31:09.66
I know that.

1947
01:31:09.66 --> 01:31:13.18
But they do have their huge role in the issue.

1948
01:31:13.18 --> 01:31:14.18
Yeah.

1949
01:31:14.18 --> 01:31:15.18
Don't do that.

1950
01:31:15.18 --> 01:31:16.54
Don't even pay attention to that.

1951
01:31:16.54 --> 01:31:20.18
All you've got to do is shine the light on your own things and say, don't.

1952
01:31:20.18 --> 01:31:24.82
I mean, and, how you say, don't be, don't like be hard in yourself, you know, like

1953
01:31:24.82 --> 01:31:26.22
that kind of like the kind of like I suck.

1954
01:31:26.22 --> 01:31:27.22
I suck.

1955
01:31:27.22 --> 01:31:28.22
It's not that.

1956
01:31:28.22 --> 01:31:29.22
It's like what I do.

1957
01:31:29.22 --> 01:31:30.22
What I do.

1958
01:31:30.22 --> 01:31:31.22
This is what I do.

1959
01:31:31.22 --> 01:31:32.22
Exactly right.

1960
01:31:32.22 --> 01:31:35.30
So what's interesting is, and you said it from the beginning, but it is interesting to just

1961
01:31:35.30 --> 01:31:36.86
watch it play out.

1962
01:31:36.86 --> 01:31:41.50
So it's almost fun, but it's more just real interesting where when you do it and you just

1963
01:31:41.50 --> 01:31:42.90
keep doing it, you always do it.

1964
01:31:42.90 --> 01:31:43.90
That's the thing.

1965
01:31:43.90 --> 01:31:45.90
You just watch how the other person just changes.

1966
01:31:45.90 --> 01:31:46.90
Yeah.

1967
01:31:46.90 --> 01:31:48.26
And just becomes kind of the same thing.

1968
01:31:48.26 --> 01:31:51.10
And before you know it, like the ripples in the water are pretty much gone.

1969
01:31:51.10 --> 01:31:52.10
Yeah.

1970
01:31:52.10 --> 01:31:56.66
And what's you need someone in the team has got to start doing it.

1971
01:31:56.66 --> 01:31:58.18
That's one of the hardest things.

1972
01:31:58.18 --> 01:31:59.18
Yeah.

1973
01:31:59.18 --> 01:32:04.78
Occasionally, we'll work with a company where everyone's like, oh, yeah, extreme ownership.

1974
01:32:04.78 --> 01:32:07.02
No one is actually doing it.

1975
01:32:07.02 --> 01:32:10.62
When no one is actually doing it, and all they're saying is like, I wish that guy

1976
01:32:10.62 --> 01:32:11.62
you had extreme ownership.

1977
01:32:11.62 --> 01:32:12.62
And that guy should have extreme ownership.

1978
01:32:12.62 --> 01:32:14.62
And I don't see anyone else taking ownership.

1979
01:32:14.62 --> 01:32:18.34
And hey, I haven't seen anyone else taking ownership.

1980
01:32:18.34 --> 01:32:21.26
Therefore, how can I take ownership?

1981
01:32:21.26 --> 01:32:25.46
You know, we send out when we work with a company, we'll send out surveys, you know,

1982
01:32:25.46 --> 01:32:30.38
pre-class surveys, and then post, because we'll do a number of sessions.

1983
01:32:30.38 --> 01:32:34.94
So we'll send out to the leadership team that we're working with, how's it going?

1984
01:32:34.94 --> 01:32:39.38
And we'll send out a week later, two weeks later, three weeks later, four weeks later.

1985
01:32:39.38 --> 01:32:44.50
Sometimes when you get a team where no one is taking ownership, and literally you hear

1986
01:32:44.50 --> 01:32:47.98
people say, well, the boss isn't taking ownership.

1987
01:32:47.98 --> 01:32:49.70
So how can I take ownership?

1988
01:32:49.70 --> 01:32:54.98
If the boss isn't even taking ownership, they don't realize that when your boss isn't

1989
01:32:54.98 --> 01:33:03.10
taking ownership, it is an opportunity for you to take ownership and to excel and to gain

1990
01:33:03.10 --> 01:33:10.02
respect and trust and power and power, which is a good thing because you're doing things

1991
01:33:10.02 --> 01:33:11.02
for the good of the team.

1992
01:33:11.02 --> 01:33:12.66
So you want to have power.

1993
01:33:12.66 --> 01:33:13.66
But I want to have power.

1994
01:33:13.66 --> 01:33:17.98
When I'm a team leader, I absolutely want to have power.

1995
01:33:17.98 --> 01:33:21.94
And the reason I want to have power, so I can distribute it properly amongst my team.

1996
01:33:21.94 --> 01:33:25.42
And I can utilize it so we can be successful in our mission.

1997
01:33:25.42 --> 01:33:30.78
So when you have your CEO isn't taking ownership, awesome.

1998
01:33:30.78 --> 01:33:35.18
I'm going to take ownership and when the rest, if the CEO is truly not taking ownership,

1999
01:33:35.18 --> 01:33:40.82
and I do, everyone else looks at me and they start to elevate my position.

2000
01:33:40.82 --> 01:33:44.22
The CEO becomes irrelevant because all he's doing is sitting around point fingers.

2001
01:33:44.22 --> 01:33:46.38
I'm taking ownership of things and solving them.

2002
01:33:46.38 --> 01:33:48.82
I'm actually going to end up in a superior position.

2003
01:33:48.82 --> 01:33:55.26
Now, I might not get promoted to CEO today or tomorrow or in two years.

2004
01:33:55.26 --> 01:34:01.98
But when this information gets back to the board or to the directors or whoever, they realize

2005
01:34:01.98 --> 01:34:05.98
that there's one person that's mutually respected by everybody and that's you because you

2006
01:34:05.98 --> 01:34:07.50
took ownership.

2007
01:34:07.50 --> 01:34:09.82
And when you take ownership, you solve problems.

2008
01:34:09.82 --> 01:34:12.58
And when you solve problems, you win.

2009
01:34:12.58 --> 01:34:15.18
But somebody has got to start it.

2010
01:34:15.18 --> 01:34:16.38
And it's hard.

2011
01:34:16.38 --> 01:34:19.34
Sometimes in some situations, you get the, what's that?

2012
01:34:19.34 --> 01:34:21.62
Where did you like the caustic environment?

2013
01:34:21.62 --> 01:34:22.62
Right, toxic.

2014
01:34:22.62 --> 01:34:29.02
Invinement, where everyone's just so, so defensive about everything.

2015
01:34:29.02 --> 01:34:30.02
And it's difficult.

2016
01:34:30.02 --> 01:34:32.06
Those are the difficult situations to work with.

2017
01:34:32.06 --> 01:34:39.54
You and all it takes is the transition of one human, one person in that team to step up

2018
01:34:39.54 --> 01:34:41.90
and say, you know what?

2019
01:34:41.90 --> 01:34:44.22
This stuff that's going wrong is my fault.

2020
01:34:44.22 --> 01:34:46.38
CEO's don't worry about him.

2021
01:34:46.38 --> 01:34:48.02
He's got enough problems.

2022
01:34:48.02 --> 01:34:53.78
He's got to deal with the, he's got to deal with the shareholders meeting.

2023
01:34:53.78 --> 01:34:55.50
We don't, we need to protect him.

2024
01:34:55.50 --> 01:34:56.50
Yeah.

2025
01:34:56.50 --> 01:34:57.50
You know what?

2026
01:34:57.50 --> 01:35:00.70
This is my fault that this happens and here's what we're going to do to fix it.

2027
01:35:00.70 --> 01:35:02.26
Here's what I'm going to do.

2028
01:35:02.26 --> 01:35:04.10
And that just changes the attitudes.

2029
01:35:04.10 --> 01:35:07.38
And of course, you're going to have two or three people in that defensive toxic environment

2030
01:35:07.38 --> 01:35:08.38
that are going to look at him.

2031
01:35:08.38 --> 01:35:09.38
Go, yeah, this is right.

2032
01:35:09.38 --> 01:35:10.38
It is your fault.

2033
01:35:10.38 --> 01:35:11.38
You know what you say to that?

2034
01:35:11.38 --> 01:35:12.38
Yes.

2035
01:35:12.38 --> 01:35:13.38
You're right.

2036
01:35:13.38 --> 01:35:14.38
It is.

2037
01:35:14.38 --> 01:35:15.38
It is my fault.

2038
01:35:15.38 --> 01:35:16.38
And here's what I'm going to do.

2039
01:35:16.38 --> 01:35:18.26
You need to change.

2040
01:35:18.26 --> 01:35:20.46
But it's hard to be that person to take that first step.

2041
01:35:20.46 --> 01:35:22.58
And then you got to keep that going.

2042
01:35:22.58 --> 01:35:25.14
But again, man, after a little bit, you see the guy next to you.

2043
01:35:25.14 --> 01:35:26.14
He's starting to do it.

2044
01:35:26.14 --> 01:35:27.14
Then the guy next to you.

2045
01:35:27.14 --> 01:35:28.94
No, it's in extreme ownership.

2046
01:35:28.94 --> 01:35:30.66
The book, it's pointed out.

2047
01:35:30.66 --> 01:35:34.90
But it's not super crystal clear that when I was taking blame for the blue on blue that happened

2048
01:35:34.90 --> 01:35:36.54
everyone else was too.

2049
01:35:36.54 --> 01:35:38.26
You know, those guys were saying, hey, it was my fault.

2050
01:35:38.26 --> 01:35:39.26
I did this.

2051
01:35:39.26 --> 01:35:40.26
It was my fault.

2052
01:35:40.26 --> 01:35:41.26
I did this.

2053
01:35:41.26 --> 01:35:45.78
And that was because that wasn't the first time these guys had seen or heard ownership.

2054
01:35:45.78 --> 01:35:48.66
You know, when we were going through training and something was screwed up, I'd be like, hey,

2055
01:35:48.66 --> 01:35:49.66
this is my fault.

2056
01:35:49.66 --> 01:35:50.66
That's what it is.

2057
01:35:50.66 --> 01:35:52.10
And so everyone had that really good attitude.

2058
01:35:52.10 --> 01:35:53.10
Yeah.

2059
01:35:53.10 --> 01:35:54.62
So that happens in the company.

2060
01:35:54.62 --> 01:35:56.14
So what you're saying, it does.

2061
01:35:56.14 --> 01:35:59.54
That's one of the best things about this idea, this principle of extreme ownership

2062
01:35:59.54 --> 01:36:01.70
is it spreads throughout the company.

2063
01:36:01.70 --> 01:36:07.38
And will you get people on the team that will not take ownership of things?

2064
01:36:07.38 --> 01:36:09.66
Yes, of course you will.

2065
01:36:09.66 --> 01:36:11.50
You will get that person.

2066
01:36:11.50 --> 01:36:14.46
And eventually they will either leave.

2067
01:36:14.46 --> 01:36:15.86
Or you will fire them.

2068
01:36:15.86 --> 01:36:18.02
One of the two things will happen because when you have a person, you got the whole

2069
01:36:18.02 --> 01:36:19.02
team is going nuts.

2070
01:36:19.02 --> 01:36:20.02
My fault.

2071
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:22.70
And eventually everyone's, oh, you, oh, that's not your responsibility.

2072
01:36:22.70 --> 01:36:23.70
Cool.

2073
01:36:23.70 --> 01:36:24.70
I'll take that.

2074
01:36:24.70 --> 01:36:25.70
Oh, echo, you can't handle that.

2075
01:36:25.70 --> 01:36:26.70
That's not your fault.

2076
01:36:26.70 --> 01:36:27.70
Okay, then I'll take it and fix it.

2077
01:36:27.70 --> 01:36:28.98
Oh, echo, you can't handle that either.

2078
01:36:28.98 --> 01:36:29.98
It's not your fault.

2079
01:36:29.98 --> 01:36:30.98
Okay, I'll take that and fix it.

2080
01:36:30.98 --> 01:36:32.34
Eventually you don't have a job anymore.

2081
01:36:32.34 --> 01:36:35.70
So if you want to take ownership of things, including problems, I will take ownership

2082
01:36:35.70 --> 01:36:38.70
of all them and I'll eventually take your job in your world and it'll be mine.

2083
01:36:38.70 --> 01:36:39.70
It's phased right out.

2084
01:36:39.70 --> 01:36:41.18
It's phased you right out.

2085
01:36:41.18 --> 01:36:43.18
Like you weren't even there.

2086
01:36:43.18 --> 01:36:44.74
So it's going to happen.

2087
01:36:44.74 --> 01:36:49.30
So yes, it's a powerful, powerful tool.

2088
01:36:49.30 --> 01:36:54.86
And the other thing is, you see, like you see politicians do it all the time.

2089
01:36:54.86 --> 01:36:57.10
They don't take ownership when they make a mistake.

2090
01:36:57.10 --> 01:37:01.06
And when they do, it's sort of this lip service of, it was my fault.

2091
01:37:01.06 --> 01:37:02.42
It was my fault that this happened.

2092
01:37:02.42 --> 01:37:05.58
But, right, right, right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2093
01:37:05.58 --> 01:37:09.22
and all anyone hears is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2094
01:37:09.22 --> 01:37:13.30
And as soon as you say but, and then you make a bunch of excuses that's all anybody hears.

2095
01:37:13.30 --> 01:37:15.70
And there's just, it's so weak.

2096
01:37:15.70 --> 01:37:18.10
It's so weak to do that.

2097
01:37:18.10 --> 01:37:22.42
And it sounds, when you like you said, when you get used to hearing it, when you get used

2098
01:37:22.42 --> 01:37:27.14
to hearing people take ownership of things, when somebody doesn't, it sounds like Satan

2099
01:37:27.14 --> 01:37:30.98
is screaming out of their mouth and just horrible.

2100
01:37:30.98 --> 01:37:31.98
It sounds awful.

2101
01:37:31.98 --> 01:37:36.54
It's like a, it's like a cacophony of this.

2102
01:37:36.54 --> 01:37:39.74
Hey, you just sickness, right?

2103
01:37:39.74 --> 01:37:40.74
That's what it is.

2104
01:37:40.74 --> 01:37:42.22
Yeah, it stands out for sure.

2105
01:37:42.22 --> 01:37:46.62
You know, when we got the moster, it's like, I was talking about how when you start

2106
01:37:46.62 --> 01:37:50.50
taking ownership of things.

2107
01:37:50.50 --> 01:37:55.86
When you start having this attitude, when you feel yourself about to make a mistake

2108
01:37:55.86 --> 01:37:58.14
of it, and so I'm going to blame on someone.

2109
01:37:58.14 --> 01:37:59.86
Like you feel like you're just going to throw up in your mouth.

2110
01:37:59.86 --> 01:38:03.18
I think it's like your, it's like vomit is coming out of your mouth.

2111
01:38:03.18 --> 01:38:04.74
And then you just throw it back down.

2112
01:38:04.74 --> 01:38:07.50
Because you don't want to let that puke out onto the floor.

2113
01:38:07.50 --> 01:38:08.78
And that everyone see it.

2114
01:38:08.78 --> 01:38:09.78
Yep, it's not allowed.

2115
01:38:09.78 --> 01:38:11.74
That's all it is when you blame everyone else.

2116
01:38:11.74 --> 01:38:12.58
It's all it is.

2117
01:38:12.58 --> 01:38:18.66
It happens all the time and it's so, it's, it's, it's, it's like the other thing I

2118
01:38:18.66 --> 01:38:26.82
talk about with, with stepping back and how you step back off the line and how much visibility

2119
01:38:26.82 --> 01:38:27.82
you have.

2120
01:38:27.82 --> 01:38:32.54
As soon as you step back off the firing line, as soon as you just elevate yourself six inches

2121
01:38:32.54 --> 01:38:34.70
above what's happening, it's the same thing.

2122
01:38:34.70 --> 01:38:37.06
When you start to take ownership, it's like the change.

2123
01:38:37.06 --> 01:38:39.22
It's just this little change.

2124
01:38:39.22 --> 01:38:43.70
But it just completely changes the dynamic of what is going on in your business and in

2125
01:38:43.70 --> 01:38:45.34
your life in your life.

2126
01:38:45.34 --> 01:38:48.42
Because it's the same thing in life when people are blaming everyone else.

2127
01:38:48.42 --> 01:38:54.14
They're blaming the market and their blame in their parents and their blame in the debt

2128
01:38:54.14 --> 01:38:58.66
that they built up and they're blaming the car that broke their blaming everything else

2129
01:38:58.66 --> 01:38:59.66
that's going on.

2130
01:38:59.66 --> 01:39:00.66
Yep.

2131
01:39:00.66 --> 01:39:03.46
And when you, when all you, and everything, when nothing is your fault, what are you going

2132
01:39:03.46 --> 01:39:04.46
to fix?

2133
01:39:04.46 --> 01:39:05.46
If you're not going to fix anything.

2134
01:39:05.46 --> 01:39:06.46
Where does it go?

2135
01:39:06.46 --> 01:39:07.46
Okay.

2136
01:39:07.46 --> 01:39:09.10
These are some mistakes that I made.

2137
01:39:09.10 --> 01:39:13.30
And here's what I'm going to do to fix them.

2138
01:39:13.30 --> 01:39:20.06
That's the paradigm change and that's where you start getting on the right path.

2139
01:39:20.06 --> 01:39:22.06
The muster, your line, at the muster.

2140
01:39:22.06 --> 01:39:24.86
I included it in the video.

2141
01:39:24.86 --> 01:39:26.22
Favorite line, I think.

2142
01:39:26.22 --> 01:39:30.22
Says, sure, I'll take the blame and I don't care.

2143
01:39:30.22 --> 01:39:34.46
I have a mission to accomplish and I gotta get the problem solved.

2144
01:39:34.46 --> 01:39:35.46
Yeah.

2145
01:39:35.46 --> 01:39:36.46
That's what it was.

2146
01:39:36.46 --> 01:39:37.46
Yeah.

2147
01:39:37.46 --> 01:39:38.46
That's part of my opinion.

2148
01:39:38.46 --> 01:39:41.58
Yeah, I will take the blame and I don't care.

2149
01:39:41.58 --> 01:39:42.58
I don't care.

2150
01:39:42.58 --> 01:39:43.58
Bring it.

2151
01:39:43.58 --> 01:39:45.58
Bring it.

2152
01:39:45.58 --> 01:39:46.58
Jocco.

2153
01:39:46.58 --> 01:39:48.58
We got time for one more.

2154
01:39:48.58 --> 01:39:49.58
Yes.

2155
01:39:49.58 --> 01:39:53.26
I think we do.

2156
01:39:53.26 --> 01:39:59.18
Jocco on the Joe Rogan experience ever last from House of Pain was on.

2157
01:39:59.18 --> 01:40:04.10
Last was explaining how it wasn't in shape and Joe played the good video form.

2158
01:40:04.10 --> 01:40:08.98
Ever last said it is inspiring but it didn't always work.

2159
01:40:08.98 --> 01:40:13.94
And the example he gave was a sick daughter who had lung disease that the doctors can't

2160
01:40:13.94 --> 01:40:15.42
explain.

2161
01:40:15.42 --> 01:40:16.90
I wondered the same thing.

2162
01:40:16.90 --> 01:40:18.78
How was a sick child?

2163
01:40:18.78 --> 01:40:19.78
Good.

2164
01:40:19.78 --> 01:40:29.14
You know, I saw that episode as well and it's definitely a...

2165
01:40:29.14 --> 01:40:32.58
hard question.

2166
01:40:32.58 --> 01:40:40.90
And actually to quote a song, a great song, by Ever last.

2167
01:40:40.90 --> 01:40:53.18
And I haven't walked a mile in his shoes and I've been extremely lucky and blessed with

2168
01:40:53.18 --> 01:41:07.26
the health of my family, my wife and my children and I am so thankful for that.

2169
01:41:07.26 --> 01:41:20.02
But I have been around disease and I have been around death and of course to say there is

2170
01:41:20.02 --> 01:41:33.34
something good about death and disease is impossible to do to hell with disease to hell with

2171
01:41:33.34 --> 01:41:42.02
cancer and ALS and heart disease and all the rest of them.

2172
01:41:42.02 --> 01:41:52.34
To hell with them all and death to hell with death.

2173
01:41:52.34 --> 01:42:06.26
I have nothing good to say about disease or death curse them both.

2174
01:42:06.26 --> 01:42:17.30
But then what is that where I'm supposed to focus?

2175
01:42:17.30 --> 01:42:28.82
Am I too latch on to death and disease and ride with them down to the depths of despair?

2176
01:42:28.82 --> 01:42:35.22
Let's say no.

2177
01:42:35.22 --> 01:42:38.22
I will not ride with them.

2178
01:42:38.22 --> 01:42:47.62
I will not go down their evil path.

2179
01:42:47.62 --> 01:43:00.42
Instead, because I cannot find good in their vile darkness, the vile darkness of disease

2180
01:43:00.42 --> 01:43:05.86
and of death, I will not feed their fire.

2181
01:43:05.86 --> 01:43:10.50
I won't feed their egos instead.

2182
01:43:10.50 --> 01:43:16.90
I'm going to look elsewhere.

2183
01:43:16.90 --> 01:43:25.02
I will look to life and light and I will find good in those places.

2184
01:43:25.02 --> 01:43:29.86
I'll find good in every moment I get.

2185
01:43:29.86 --> 01:43:32.02
I'll find good in every breath.

2186
01:43:32.02 --> 01:43:42.22
I'll find good making memories and holding them dear.

2187
01:43:42.22 --> 01:43:53.54
I'll find good in knowing that I will learn from this horrible experience.

2188
01:43:53.54 --> 01:44:00.66
At everything that I'm going through all the pain and suffering and darkness, it'll make

2189
01:44:00.66 --> 01:44:10.30
the light brighter and stronger and more powerful.

2190
01:44:10.30 --> 01:44:19.90
More powerful than disease and more powerful than death.

2191
01:44:19.90 --> 01:44:35.82
So cry and scream and shake your fists at the sky and curse death and curse disease and

2192
01:44:35.82 --> 01:44:40.78
shout to the world that life isn't fair.

2193
01:44:40.78 --> 01:44:42.82
And that this is not deserved.

2194
01:44:42.82 --> 01:44:49.86
Not for me, not for my child, not for my friend, my spouse, my brother, my sister.

2195
01:44:49.86 --> 01:44:56.50
Not for anyone.

2196
01:44:56.50 --> 01:45:12.90
And then book up and breathe and all that darkness and all that evil.

2197
01:45:12.90 --> 01:45:18.58
Let it all go.

2198
01:45:18.58 --> 01:45:29.86
And when it creeps back again, let it go again.

2199
01:45:29.86 --> 01:45:34.18
Let it go.

2200
01:45:34.18 --> 01:45:49.70
I'm looking forward toward the light, toward life, toward the future.

2201
01:45:49.70 --> 01:46:04.14
And of the past, let the memories, the sacred memories let those flourish in grow.

2202
01:46:04.14 --> 01:46:26.90
And expunge the darkness from your world and replace it all with good.

2203
01:46:26.90 --> 01:46:40.82
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2204
01:46:40.82 --> 01:46:41.82
The Ruffling.

2205
01:46:41.82 --> 01:46:54.74
Yeah, I think it's like, I think that that, like that outlook on it is important because

2206
01:46:54.74 --> 01:47:00.62
that's not just easy to do, especially man, and me, probably I've been lucky.

2207
01:47:00.62 --> 01:47:05.66
My daughter had a staff infection in her lymph nodes in the hospital for a week, and after

2208
01:47:05.66 --> 01:47:06.66
them like that.

2209
01:47:06.66 --> 01:47:10.94
And you have the viewpoint, you're lucky that that happened.

2210
01:47:10.94 --> 01:47:16.10
When you go to a children's ward and you see kids that are just suffering from horrible

2211
01:47:16.10 --> 01:47:17.50
diseases, it's awful.

2212
01:47:17.50 --> 01:47:18.50
You feel lucky.

2213
01:47:18.50 --> 01:47:20.10
Exactly as you should.

2214
01:47:20.10 --> 01:47:22.82
They were lucky to have this.

2215
01:47:22.82 --> 01:47:34.34
And in that moment when we're in the hospital, you're scared, you're sad, scared for them.

2216
01:47:34.34 --> 01:47:41.94
But I think that just even hearing that is like, it does help.

2217
01:47:41.94 --> 01:47:51.30
Yeah, and it's one of the things that when you talk about the reaction you have and the

2218
01:47:51.30 --> 01:47:59.66
fact that it's okay to like scream and shake your fist at the sky that's okay for

2219
01:47:59.66 --> 01:48:01.38
that.

2220
01:48:01.38 --> 01:48:06.18
And then I'm saying that you've got to let it go, but at the same time, everyone's

2221
01:48:06.18 --> 01:48:10.74
got to realize that like you let it go, it's coming back.

2222
01:48:10.74 --> 01:48:14.58
It's coming back and it'll sneak up on you again.

2223
01:48:14.58 --> 01:48:16.30
And then you kind of do it again.

2224
01:48:16.30 --> 01:48:26.66
You've got to go through that, you've got to scream and curse the evil that it is.

2225
01:48:26.66 --> 01:48:30.34
And then you've got to let it go again and you're going to go through that cycle over and

2226
01:48:30.34 --> 01:48:31.66
over again.

2227
01:48:31.66 --> 01:48:36.82
But what you can't do is you can't not go through the cycle, you can't just get trapped

2228
01:48:36.82 --> 01:48:39.98
in the screaming and the suffering and the pain.

2229
01:48:39.98 --> 01:48:41.86
You can't get trapped there and it's really hard.

2230
01:48:41.86 --> 01:48:49.82
And I noticed that when I had my friends get killed overseas, I realized when we'd

2231
01:48:49.82 --> 01:48:54.26
be home and like everything would be normal, like maybe it would be out having some beers

2232
01:48:54.26 --> 01:48:58.06
with the boys or we'd be doing something and all of a sudden like you just get hit with

2233
01:48:58.06 --> 01:48:59.74
this wave of sadness.

2234
01:48:59.74 --> 01:49:05.90
And it would kind of just almost instantly I'd be like breaking down a bit, like ready

2235
01:49:05.90 --> 01:49:07.78
to cry or crying.

2236
01:49:07.78 --> 01:49:13.02
And then three minutes later, I'm like out of it, you know, I just had to get rid of it.

2237
01:49:13.02 --> 01:49:17.58
I just had to explain this sadness.

2238
01:49:17.58 --> 01:49:23.42
But what you can't do is you just can't get caught in those cycles and I think that's

2239
01:49:23.42 --> 01:49:24.82
what happens to people and again.

2240
01:49:24.82 --> 01:49:29.78
I haven't walked a mile in those shoes.

2241
01:49:29.78 --> 01:49:32.86
But what I have seen is I know that it's hard.

2242
01:49:32.86 --> 01:49:39.70
I know that it's hard breaking, but you can't let it break everything.

2243
01:49:39.70 --> 01:49:42.02
You have to try and hold it together.

2244
01:49:42.02 --> 01:49:47.98
Yeah, it's like part of the going through, I know this on low level, I guess I understand

2245
01:49:47.98 --> 01:49:48.98
it's like a little bit.

2246
01:49:48.98 --> 01:49:53.42
Part of the feeling that you get is like, what do I do?

2247
01:49:53.42 --> 01:49:58.62
I feel like I can't do anything and then that provides these feelings, you know.

2248
01:49:58.62 --> 01:50:03.42
But if you start to understand what it is that you do have to do and one of those things

2249
01:50:03.42 --> 01:50:07.14
is essentially like understand it that yeah, it's going on.

2250
01:50:07.14 --> 01:50:12.22
Don't try to block it or escape, do some escapeous activity or whatever.

2251
01:50:12.22 --> 01:50:18.86
Just know and understand that it's going on and then on top of that, on top of it, your job

2252
01:50:18.86 --> 01:50:21.02
is to be strong, you know.

2253
01:50:21.02 --> 01:50:24.86
You know, that's another thing that I've noticed, especially in it happens with anybody,

2254
01:50:24.86 --> 01:50:31.22
but with some of my seal friends that have been in these horrible situations is they're

2255
01:50:31.22 --> 01:50:38.38
alpha guys that are used to being in control of everything and used to being able to control

2256
01:50:38.38 --> 01:50:44.94
the outcome and you can't control the outcome.

2257
01:50:44.94 --> 01:50:47.26
And then what do you do?

2258
01:50:47.26 --> 01:50:54.30
Well, it's like we learned from Charlie Plum, it's like we learned from Bill Reader.

2259
01:50:54.30 --> 01:50:58.02
You can't control that thing.

2260
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:04.98
The only thing you can control is your own attitude, your own view of what's happening.

2261
01:51:04.98 --> 01:51:09.82
And if you control your attitude and you make your attitude the best possible attitude

2262
01:51:09.82 --> 01:51:11.46
it can be, that's the best you're going to do.

2263
01:51:11.46 --> 01:51:18.90
And again, I wish there was some, I don't have some miracle solution to these situations.

2264
01:51:18.90 --> 01:51:22.42
No one does if we had the miracle, these problems wouldn't happen.

2265
01:51:22.42 --> 01:51:25.10
These horrible things wouldn't happen.

2266
01:51:25.10 --> 01:51:27.50
So what can we actually control?

2267
01:51:27.50 --> 01:51:35.62
Well, what we'll keep, control is our own view of it, our own assessment, our own attitude.

2268
01:51:35.62 --> 01:51:41.38
And that sounds such like a trite word, but our own attitude of what's happening and

2269
01:51:41.38 --> 01:51:44.06
make that as good as we can.

2270
01:51:44.06 --> 01:51:47.50
And are there going to be points where your attitude turns completely dark and negative

2271
01:51:47.50 --> 01:51:48.66
of course there are?

2272
01:51:48.66 --> 01:51:50.54
How can you not?

2273
01:51:50.54 --> 01:51:54.86
And don't let it be permanent.

2274
01:51:54.86 --> 01:51:58.78
Don't let it be permanent for the sake of the situation, for the sake of the person you

2275
01:51:58.78 --> 01:52:00.50
care about.

2276
01:52:00.50 --> 01:52:03.82
They don't want you to live like that.

2277
01:52:03.82 --> 01:52:09.90
So don't, and again, it's going to be sick, sickle curve from what I've seen, it's going

2278
01:52:09.90 --> 01:52:11.38
to be cyclical in nature.

2279
01:52:11.38 --> 01:52:19.26
The way it happens, the way people deal with these horrible emotions is they go down and

2280
01:52:19.26 --> 01:52:24.94
they come up and then they go down and they come up and when they go down, when your emotions

2281
01:52:24.94 --> 01:52:33.14
go down and when you get dragged into the mindset of loss, then I think the best thing to

2282
01:52:33.14 --> 01:52:34.46
do is just embrace it.

2283
01:52:34.46 --> 01:52:40.46
Grab it and say, yeah, like I said, shake your fist at the sky and scream.

2284
01:52:40.46 --> 01:52:46.54
And then let it out, get it out and then pick it back up and say to yourself, okay, that

2285
01:52:46.54 --> 01:52:47.78
was horrible.

2286
01:52:47.78 --> 01:52:53.62
That's darkness, that's evil, that I couldn't control what can I control and how can

2287
01:52:53.62 --> 01:52:58.82
I have the best possible view and what can I learn from all this that's going to make

2288
01:52:58.82 --> 01:53:04.66
me a better person with a better life to live the best I can in their memories.

2289
01:53:04.66 --> 01:53:13.14
You didn't, man, man, man, man when you're in the situation, especially with work,

2290
01:53:13.14 --> 01:53:17.50
you know, where your daughter's like, you know, in the hospital or whatever, and you're

2291
01:53:17.50 --> 01:53:19.86
like, yeah, I haven't worked out this whole week.

2292
01:53:19.86 --> 01:53:20.86
Yeah.

2293
01:53:20.86 --> 01:53:22.98
It's like who cares about work out to your daughters in the hospital?

2294
01:53:22.98 --> 01:53:23.98
Yeah.

2295
01:53:23.98 --> 01:53:24.98
You know, you didn't make it to your daughter.

2296
01:53:24.98 --> 01:53:27.34
You don't care about your daughter anymore.

2297
01:53:27.34 --> 01:53:29.58
You just care about this one thing, you know.

2298
01:53:29.58 --> 01:53:34.90
But again, just like how you said, it's like, so it's like this big burden in life.

2299
01:53:34.90 --> 01:53:40.30
Because really, you know, a lot of time your kids are like, all you have really, it feels

2300
01:53:40.30 --> 01:53:41.30
like.

2301
01:53:41.30 --> 01:53:43.66
So if you don't have them, who cares about your daughter?

2302
01:53:43.66 --> 01:53:44.66
Who cares about working out?

2303
01:53:44.66 --> 01:53:45.66
I don't have anything.

2304
01:53:45.66 --> 01:53:48.54
You know, there's no reason to even do them really.

2305
01:53:48.54 --> 01:53:54.86
But aside from the fact is, there is more like two-year life.

2306
01:53:54.86 --> 01:54:01.66
And in fact, the more your whole life beside them is for them, you know.

2307
01:54:01.66 --> 01:54:03.98
So you gotta keep that.

2308
01:54:03.98 --> 01:54:04.98
I think.

2309
01:54:04.98 --> 01:54:06.98
Yeah, no doubt.

2310
01:54:06.98 --> 01:54:07.98
Yeah.

2311
01:54:07.98 --> 01:54:14.46
And I think that's always an important thing to remember is that,

2312
01:54:14.46 --> 01:54:31.06
if you surrender to all that bad evil darkness, that's the legacy, that's the example,

2313
01:54:31.06 --> 01:54:33.46
that's what you're showing.

2314
01:54:33.46 --> 01:54:49.38
As opposed to showing the legacy and showing the example of not giving up, of moving forward,

2315
01:54:49.38 --> 01:54:58.46
of driving on and doing the best you can with life and with the things that are good.

2316
01:54:58.46 --> 01:55:11.46
And again, having the attitude to control the things you can control and put them in the best possible light that you can.

2317
01:55:11.46 --> 01:55:15.06
Yeah, and it's a spectrum, you know.

2318
01:55:15.06 --> 01:55:21.26
I mean, it kind of puts into perspective in my opinion.

2319
01:55:21.26 --> 01:55:26.34
Why you should do the best you can when things are going good.

2320
01:55:26.34 --> 01:55:27.34
Yeah.

2321
01:55:27.34 --> 01:55:28.78
Because they're not always going to go good.

2322
01:55:28.78 --> 01:55:29.78
Yeah.

2323
01:55:29.78 --> 01:55:32.78
Just my opinion.

2324
01:55:32.78 --> 01:55:41.26
Anyway, speaking of doing the best you can, you look, working out, we know, obvious,

2325
01:55:41.26 --> 01:55:43.46
obvious, workout.

2326
01:55:43.46 --> 01:55:44.82
Work out hard too.

2327
01:55:44.82 --> 01:55:49.18
You know, I mean, maybe not every single day working out hard, but work out hard.

2328
01:55:49.18 --> 01:55:51.58
When you do work out hard, you might need some supplementation.

2329
01:55:51.58 --> 01:55:53.58
I think I wasn't a supplement guy.

2330
01:55:53.58 --> 01:55:54.90
I wasn't before.

2331
01:55:54.90 --> 01:55:55.90
You know this, right?

2332
01:55:55.90 --> 01:55:56.90
Right.

2333
01:55:56.90 --> 01:55:57.90
I might have mentioned it.

2334
01:55:57.90 --> 01:56:01.54
Everyone else.

2335
01:56:01.54 --> 01:56:03.22
But now I am a supplement guy.

2336
01:56:03.22 --> 01:56:07.14
Happy to say, not the kind of supplement guy who's like, hey, take this power gainer.

2337
01:56:07.14 --> 01:56:10.94
Hey, what kind of protein powder you take, but even though I'm not against protein powder,

2338
01:56:10.94 --> 01:56:11.94
I don't take in.

2339
01:56:11.94 --> 01:56:16.54
But nonetheless, you know what I'm talking about.

2340
01:56:16.54 --> 01:56:18.90
Grill oil.

2341
01:56:18.90 --> 01:56:21.26
I'm going to say to my father and law is named his Ross.

2342
01:56:21.26 --> 01:56:24.66
I'm sorry for not heating all of you.

2343
01:56:24.66 --> 01:56:27.02
Heading his just advice.

2344
01:56:27.02 --> 01:56:29.42
Can you heat advice or is it just warning advice?

2345
01:56:29.42 --> 01:56:30.42
Okay.

2346
01:56:30.42 --> 01:56:32.86
So you can heat warnings and advice.

2347
01:56:32.86 --> 01:56:34.94
I should have heated Ross's advice.

2348
01:56:34.94 --> 01:56:37.06
My father and law.

2349
01:56:37.06 --> 01:56:40.22
About to grill oil.

2350
01:56:40.22 --> 01:56:44.14
Eventually, Jocca turned me back onto it or further onto it.

2351
01:56:44.14 --> 01:56:45.14
So I'm on it now.

2352
01:56:45.14 --> 01:56:46.74
I think, um, we have it.

2353
01:56:46.74 --> 01:56:48.78
Literally on it on it.

2354
01:56:48.78 --> 01:56:50.02
Con intended.

2355
01:56:50.02 --> 01:56:51.02
Yeah.

2356
01:56:51.02 --> 01:56:54.34
On it is the company if you didn't know already.

2357
01:56:54.34 --> 01:57:00.02
I get Jocca gets krill oil from on it on it.

2358
01:57:00.02 --> 01:57:04.10
If you want 10% off all these supplements, which are what?

2359
01:57:04.10 --> 01:57:08.78
Shroom tech, case room tech, good for oxygen uptake is what it is.

2360
01:57:08.78 --> 01:57:13.70
So when you're doing these hardcore metcons, jiu-jitsu, your body takes up the oxygen

2361
01:57:13.70 --> 01:57:15.86
easier more efficiently.

2362
01:57:15.86 --> 01:57:18.06
Quarter steps, mushroom.

2363
01:57:18.06 --> 01:57:21.14
Just some science for you right there.

2364
01:57:21.14 --> 01:57:22.38
Strong bone that helped me.

2365
01:57:22.38 --> 01:57:26.78
I had this, um, and I kind of wanted to report this before, but I want to take too much

2366
01:57:26.78 --> 01:57:27.78
time.

2367
01:57:27.78 --> 01:57:29.26
And the jiu-jitsu still kind of out on it.

2368
01:57:29.26 --> 01:57:32.78
But so I had this tendonitis kind of situation.

2369
01:57:32.78 --> 01:57:33.78
And it's weird.

2370
01:57:33.78 --> 01:57:34.78
It wasn't in like a normal place.

2371
01:57:34.78 --> 01:57:37.22
Like in your elbow, it was in my deltoid muscle.

2372
01:57:37.22 --> 01:57:42.62
Where it inserts into the humorous bone, which is your bone under your bicep.

2373
01:57:42.62 --> 01:57:44.42
And it was like tendonitis.

2374
01:57:44.42 --> 01:57:46.26
And it's like, you know the kind of like, I'm not injured.

2375
01:57:46.26 --> 01:57:49.06
I'm not out, but I warm up more and rub on it.

2376
01:57:49.06 --> 01:57:50.06
You know all this stuff.

2377
01:57:50.06 --> 01:57:52.46
I'm not going to take days off if I'm not injured.

2378
01:57:52.46 --> 01:57:54.10
So Brad, this thing wasn't going to get better.

2379
01:57:54.10 --> 01:57:55.50
That's the thing about tendonitis.

2380
01:57:55.50 --> 01:57:58.14
Like if you keep lifting hard on it, it just simply won't go away.

2381
01:57:58.14 --> 01:58:01.10
It's the whole reason that's tendonitis because you're lifting hard on it.

2382
01:58:01.10 --> 01:58:02.10
You know?

2383
01:58:02.10 --> 01:58:03.10
And Brad, this thing's not going away.

2384
01:58:03.10 --> 01:58:06.46
I'm just going to have to live with it or wait for, you know, the time where I don't

2385
01:58:06.46 --> 01:58:07.82
know how to skip workouts, whatever.

2386
01:58:07.82 --> 01:58:09.10
But I'm on the strong bone.

2387
01:58:09.10 --> 01:58:10.42
I'm like, I'm like, I'm strong bone.

2388
01:58:10.42 --> 01:58:11.42
Let's see what up.

2389
01:58:11.42 --> 01:58:14.06
You know, do your thing.

2390
01:58:14.06 --> 01:58:18.78
I'm not saying it was because of the strong bone, but nonetheless, the tendonitis, it's not

2391
01:58:18.78 --> 01:58:19.78
completely gone.

2392
01:58:19.78 --> 01:58:21.98
I'm beyond the studio, but it's pretty much gone.

2393
01:58:21.98 --> 01:58:24.18
I'm warming up normal.

2394
01:58:24.18 --> 01:58:25.82
I'm a believer of the strong bone.

2395
01:58:25.82 --> 01:58:27.34
Thanks for turning me on to that.

2396
01:58:27.34 --> 01:58:28.34
Check.

2397
01:58:28.34 --> 01:58:29.34
Jockle.

2398
01:58:29.34 --> 01:58:30.34
You know what?

2399
01:58:30.34 --> 01:58:31.34
Going there.

2400
01:58:31.34 --> 01:58:35.14
There's a lot of good stuff for a lot of good things from supplements and this workout

2401
01:58:35.14 --> 01:58:36.66
stuff on there too.

2402
01:58:36.66 --> 01:58:42.86
So I already had weights and a gym membership.

2403
01:58:42.86 --> 01:58:45.70
But when you go on there, you see the stuff that they have, you're going to get some

2404
01:58:45.70 --> 01:58:46.70
of that too.

2405
01:58:46.70 --> 01:58:51.02
Not normal, like kettlebells, you know, there's all the cool ones.

2406
01:58:51.02 --> 01:58:53.26
And there's info too on this stuff.

2407
01:58:53.26 --> 01:58:58.42
I understand that a lot of people, a lot of us, we want more info than just, oh, Jockle

2408
01:58:58.42 --> 01:58:59.42
takes it.

2409
01:58:59.42 --> 01:59:00.98
So I'm going to take it.

2410
01:59:00.98 --> 01:59:01.98
Some of us are like that.

2411
01:59:01.98 --> 01:59:03.26
Anyway, we need more info.

2412
01:59:03.26 --> 01:59:07.10
So there's info on the website.

2413
01:59:07.10 --> 01:59:12.18
Be careful, you can get stuck on there because it's real interesting and in depth, by the way.

2414
01:59:12.18 --> 01:59:13.62
So just be careful with that.

2415
01:59:13.62 --> 01:59:15.90
Anyway, on it.com slash Jockle.

2416
01:59:15.90 --> 01:59:17.42
I recommend the krill oil.

2417
01:59:17.42 --> 01:59:18.42
Big time.

2418
01:59:18.42 --> 01:59:20.46
To me, if you're not on the krill oil, you're behind.

2419
01:59:20.46 --> 01:59:22.66
You're like a good one to two steps behind.

2420
01:59:22.66 --> 01:59:23.94
Like steps, steps.

2421
01:59:23.94 --> 01:59:25.74
Not like a half step.

2422
01:59:25.74 --> 01:59:27.62
Like your behind.

2423
01:59:27.62 --> 01:59:34.10
If I had a twin brother, which I do, you give us a five year period to your period.

2424
01:59:34.10 --> 01:59:35.18
I'm on krill oil.

2425
01:59:35.18 --> 01:59:36.58
He's not on krill oil.

2426
01:59:36.58 --> 01:59:39.18
We do the same exact workout program, same lifestyle.

2427
01:59:39.18 --> 01:59:40.30
I'm way ahead of him.

2428
01:59:40.30 --> 01:59:41.30
Where ahead of him.

2429
01:59:41.30 --> 01:59:42.30
When we're functional.

2430
01:59:42.30 --> 01:59:43.30
This is factual.

2431
01:59:43.30 --> 01:59:46.06
This is my hypothesis.

2432
01:59:46.06 --> 01:59:47.06
Okay.

2433
01:59:47.06 --> 01:59:48.06
Is J.

2434
01:59:48.06 --> 01:59:49.06
Is J.

2435
01:59:49.06 --> 01:59:51.94
I don't, yeah, he's on krill oil, but he don't have that same.

2436
01:59:51.94 --> 01:59:53.82
He doesn't get after it physically.

2437
01:59:53.82 --> 01:59:56.02
As much as I do.

2438
01:59:56.02 --> 02:00:00.70
So it's hard to have that for a basis for comparison for the krill oil.

2439
02:00:00.70 --> 02:00:02.14
Nonetheless, good stuff on there.

2440
02:00:02.14 --> 02:00:06.06
The good thing about on it, I can say this with pretty much absolutely certainty at this

2441
02:00:06.06 --> 02:00:07.74
point, is that it's the good one.

2442
02:00:07.74 --> 02:00:12.78
It's good stuff because supplements in general.

2443
02:00:12.78 --> 02:00:16.90
I don't want to mention any store names, but when you go in the meathead, buddy builder

2444
02:00:16.90 --> 02:00:20.62
store, a lot of those supplements are their whack.

2445
02:00:20.62 --> 02:00:24.86
They just have sparkly labels and stuff in their junk.

2446
02:00:24.86 --> 02:00:26.94
On it is not like that.

2447
02:00:26.94 --> 02:00:28.34
Get 10% off.

2448
02:00:28.34 --> 02:00:32.70
If you want 10% off, go on it.com slash jockel.

2449
02:00:32.70 --> 02:00:35.18
That's a good way to support this podcast as well.

2450
02:00:35.18 --> 02:00:38.18
Another good way to support my opinion.

2451
02:00:38.18 --> 02:00:44.78
What's interesting is get your review books on here and sometimes actually a lot of times

2452
02:00:44.78 --> 02:00:49.94
when you have the guests, you actually have their book and you read their book to them.

2453
02:00:49.94 --> 02:00:56.10
Yeah, which is like a, with a really, that was, and I think I'm probably talked about this.

2454
02:00:56.10 --> 02:00:58.38
But when we had jodimitic, this is the first time it happened.

2455
02:00:58.38 --> 02:01:03.98
And jodi came on and you know, I had this book and I was like, okay, well, should I have

2456
02:01:03.98 --> 02:01:09.62
him read this or should I read this or I just wasn't quite sure.

2457
02:01:09.62 --> 02:01:14.90
And it seemed like the common sense answer would be jodi read this section of your book.

2458
02:01:14.90 --> 02:01:15.90
Right?

2459
02:01:15.90 --> 02:01:18.14
I was kind of like the common sense answer and then you could talk about it.

2460
02:01:18.14 --> 02:01:22.26
And for some reason, my gut told me, don't know.

2461
02:01:22.26 --> 02:01:23.26
Jockel read it.

2462
02:01:23.26 --> 02:01:24.26
I read it.

2463
02:01:24.26 --> 02:01:25.26
Yeah.

2464
02:01:25.26 --> 02:01:26.26
Right.

2465
02:01:26.26 --> 02:01:32.30
And as soon as we got, you know, probably, I don't know halfway through it.

2466
02:01:32.30 --> 02:01:36.62
What he said, you know, something like man here and you read this is like crazy.

2467
02:01:36.62 --> 02:01:37.62
Yeah.

2468
02:01:37.62 --> 02:01:44.66
And it's true when you hear someone else read something to you, it's different.

2469
02:01:44.66 --> 02:01:45.66
Yeah.

2470
02:01:45.66 --> 02:01:46.66
It's different.

2471
02:01:46.66 --> 02:01:50.26
So that's what I've done every time since, you know, when we had Colonel read her

2472
02:01:50.26 --> 02:01:52.26
on here and he said the same thing.

2473
02:01:52.26 --> 02:01:53.26
It's the same thing.

2474
02:01:53.26 --> 02:01:56.62
No, it's hard when he's like, he's saying the most unemotional way.

2475
02:01:56.62 --> 02:02:01.86
He's like, when you're reading this to me, it's extremely emotional for me to hear.

2476
02:02:01.86 --> 02:02:08.18
You know, but it's in and same thing with Captain Plum, you know, same thing.

2477
02:02:08.18 --> 02:02:10.18
And man, you know, yeah.

2478
02:02:10.18 --> 02:02:11.18
Yeah.

2479
02:02:11.18 --> 02:02:13.22
So it's really interesting.

2480
02:02:13.22 --> 02:02:14.22
The way that works.

2481
02:02:14.22 --> 02:02:20.78
And it's definitely it's unbelievable to have the author sitting there and to have my spin.

2482
02:02:20.78 --> 02:02:21.78
Yeah.

2483
02:02:21.78 --> 02:02:22.90
Because that's what it is, right?

2484
02:02:22.90 --> 02:02:26.18
It's the way I hear it.

2485
02:02:26.18 --> 02:02:33.10
And for them to hear the way I hear it, it hits them from a different angle.

2486
02:02:33.10 --> 02:02:34.10
Yeah.

2487
02:02:34.10 --> 02:02:35.10
Right.

2488
02:02:35.10 --> 02:02:38.30
So I think that's where the interesting, powerful part comes from.

2489
02:02:38.30 --> 02:02:40.78
And it's very interesting.

2490
02:02:40.78 --> 02:02:42.50
And essentially, you know, watch it.

2491
02:02:42.50 --> 02:02:46.34
Because, you know, you're a little bit different than a typical person just reading a book.

2492
02:02:46.34 --> 02:02:52.02
You know, so you really get the, to me is what it feels like is like, that's kind

2493
02:02:52.02 --> 02:02:54.02
of how the book is supposed to feel.

2494
02:02:54.02 --> 02:02:56.14
You know, like when you read it, I would ever.

2495
02:02:56.14 --> 02:02:59.14
So, you know, the point is like, I think a lot of people feel that.

2496
02:02:59.14 --> 02:03:01.26
So, you know, they say, oh, I want to go get this book.

2497
02:03:01.26 --> 02:03:02.82
But they're like, oh, what was that book?

2498
02:03:02.82 --> 02:03:03.82
And I kind of rewind it.

2499
02:03:03.82 --> 02:03:04.82
So anyway, you don't have to do that.

2500
02:03:04.82 --> 02:03:06.66
Just go on our website, talk aboutcast.com.

2501
02:03:06.66 --> 02:03:08.62
There's a section on the top books.

2502
02:03:08.62 --> 02:03:09.62
Boom.

2503
02:03:09.62 --> 02:03:10.62
There they are.

2504
02:03:10.62 --> 02:03:11.94
All the books by episode.

2505
02:03:11.94 --> 02:03:12.94
Boom.

2506
02:03:12.94 --> 02:03:13.94
You can get them.

2507
02:03:13.94 --> 02:03:17.06
And when you buy your books through there, support the podcast as well.

2508
02:03:17.06 --> 02:03:18.06
So boom.

2509
02:03:18.06 --> 02:03:19.06
Double, double.

2510
02:03:19.06 --> 02:03:20.06
Edge.

2511
02:03:20.06 --> 02:03:21.06
Double gravitational.

2512
02:03:21.06 --> 02:03:22.06
Double.

2513
02:03:22.06 --> 02:03:24.06
It looks like it's a two-prong.

2514
02:03:24.06 --> 02:03:28.10
Now what if you just hear what if you weren't getting a book, you were getting like duct tape?

2515
02:03:28.10 --> 02:03:29.10
Anything.

2516
02:03:29.10 --> 02:03:30.10
Yeah.

2517
02:03:30.10 --> 02:03:31.10
So that's the thing.

2518
02:03:31.10 --> 02:03:32.10
Yeah, it's there.

2519
02:03:32.10 --> 02:03:33.10
Our Amazon click through situations.

2520
02:03:33.10 --> 02:03:35.30
So yeah, even if before you do your shopping, boom, just click through.

2521
02:03:35.30 --> 02:03:37.78
We've got banners, Amazon manners all up on there.

2522
02:03:37.78 --> 02:03:38.78
Click there.

2523
02:03:38.78 --> 02:03:39.98
But most people, they do the books.

2524
02:03:39.98 --> 02:03:42.18
You know, but yeah, if you're doing your shopping as well, do you see that?

2525
02:03:42.18 --> 02:03:43.78
You look at golf clubs.

2526
02:03:43.78 --> 02:03:44.78
Golf clubs, whatever you like.

2527
02:03:44.78 --> 02:03:45.78
You look at cameras.

2528
02:03:45.78 --> 02:03:46.98
Some people don't seem pretty cool.

2529
02:03:46.98 --> 02:03:50.82
I take a high dollar items, which is very impactful.

2530
02:03:50.82 --> 02:03:56.34
And in the low ticket items, low or cost items, you might not think it's a big deal.

2531
02:03:56.34 --> 02:03:58.18
But then when a bunch of people do it, it is a big deal.

2532
02:03:58.18 --> 02:03:59.66
And it's very, very helpful.

2533
02:03:59.66 --> 02:04:00.66
Yeah.

2534
02:04:00.66 --> 02:04:01.66
To the podcast.

2535
02:04:01.66 --> 02:04:02.66
Yep.

2536
02:04:02.66 --> 02:04:04.38
Good way to support the Amazon click through.

2537
02:04:04.38 --> 02:04:05.38
Boom.

2538
02:04:05.38 --> 02:04:10.18
Also, good way to support this podcast is to subscribe.

2539
02:04:10.18 --> 02:04:11.18
Seems obvious.

2540
02:04:11.18 --> 02:04:12.54
I know.

2541
02:04:12.54 --> 02:04:18.94
But you know, if you haven't subscribed on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher.

2542
02:04:18.94 --> 02:04:20.34
What's the other one that I keep missing?

2543
02:04:20.34 --> 02:04:21.34
I don't know.

2544
02:04:21.34 --> 02:04:22.34
Hey man, whatever podcast.

2545
02:04:22.34 --> 02:04:24.34
Those are my favorites that I post.

2546
02:04:24.34 --> 02:04:25.90
Well, I'm supposed to say something about SoundCloud.

2547
02:04:25.90 --> 02:04:26.90
I got to look into it.

2548
02:04:26.90 --> 02:04:29.58
I don't think that that's a subscribe podcast situation.

2549
02:04:29.58 --> 02:04:30.58
I don't know.

2550
02:04:30.58 --> 02:04:31.58
They're just audio.

2551
02:04:31.58 --> 02:04:32.90
I don't know either, especially, even say anything.

2552
02:04:32.90 --> 02:04:34.22
But nonetheless, I look into it.

2553
02:04:34.22 --> 02:04:37.74
If in fact, people are committed to the sound, cloud situation.

2554
02:04:37.74 --> 02:04:40.10
Anyway, subscribe if you haven't already.

2555
02:04:40.10 --> 02:04:41.10
Also YouTube.

2556
02:04:41.10 --> 02:04:46.50
If you want or are interested in the video version of this podcast, it's been on their

2557
02:04:46.50 --> 02:04:48.66
sense number seven.

2558
02:04:48.66 --> 02:04:50.30
I think seven was.

2559
02:04:50.30 --> 02:04:51.98
Was the first video episode we did?

2560
02:04:51.98 --> 02:04:55.58
The other ones are on there, but they're just audio with the picture of your head.

2561
02:04:55.58 --> 02:04:56.58
Not in your head.

2562
02:04:56.58 --> 02:04:58.58
Yeah, that's up in the spotlight.

2563
02:04:58.58 --> 02:04:59.58
It's face it.

2564
02:04:59.58 --> 02:05:01.22
But yeah, if you're interested in that, go into YouTube.

2565
02:05:01.22 --> 02:05:03.02
The two videos from back then, I do.

2566
02:05:03.02 --> 02:05:04.02
Kind of.

2567
02:05:04.02 --> 02:05:05.02
I'm so bummed out.

2568
02:05:05.02 --> 02:05:06.02
We don't have it.

2569
02:05:06.02 --> 02:05:08.82
Yeah, the closest you have is like a picture of me trying to, what was that?

2570
02:05:08.82 --> 02:05:09.82
All is the app.

2571
02:05:09.82 --> 02:05:10.82
Apparoscope.

2572
02:05:10.82 --> 02:05:11.82
Yeah, yeah.

2573
02:05:11.82 --> 02:05:12.82
That's one we did live on.

2574
02:05:12.82 --> 02:05:13.82
Paroscope.

2575
02:05:13.82 --> 02:05:14.82
We tried.

2576
02:05:14.82 --> 02:05:15.82
No, we did.

2577
02:05:15.82 --> 02:05:16.82
We did it live on.

2578
02:05:16.82 --> 02:05:17.82
Paroscope.

2579
02:05:17.82 --> 02:05:18.82
Huh.

2580
02:05:18.82 --> 02:05:19.82
Yeah.

2581
02:05:19.82 --> 02:05:20.82
That's the last video.

2582
02:05:20.82 --> 02:05:21.82
I know.

2583
02:05:21.82 --> 02:05:24.62
Nonetheless, video, that's the point there.

2584
02:05:24.62 --> 02:05:30.46
If you want to see, you know, I guess what we look like, if you don't know, I feel like

2585
02:05:30.46 --> 02:05:31.46
the guess.

2586
02:05:31.46 --> 02:05:32.46
That's where the value comes in.

2587
02:05:32.46 --> 02:05:34.06
For like the sea of like the gas.

2588
02:05:34.06 --> 02:05:35.06
Right.

2589
02:05:35.06 --> 02:05:36.06
The hero.

2590
02:05:36.06 --> 02:05:37.06
The hero.

2591
02:05:37.06 --> 02:05:38.06
Yeah.

2592
02:05:38.06 --> 02:05:39.06
Right.

2593
02:05:39.06 --> 02:05:40.06
Yeah.

2594
02:05:40.06 --> 02:05:42.46
That's a good one too, because he's like his story, man.

2595
02:05:42.46 --> 02:05:43.46
It's fun.

2596
02:05:43.46 --> 02:05:45.46
He acts things out a little bit as he sits.

2597
02:05:45.46 --> 02:05:46.46
Yeah.

2598
02:05:46.46 --> 02:05:49.22
But in this real mellow kind of nonchalant badass way, you know?

2599
02:05:49.22 --> 02:05:50.22
That's real good.

2600
02:05:50.22 --> 02:05:52.66
But yeah, YouTube, subscribe to that one.

2601
02:05:52.66 --> 02:05:56.22
If you like also, yeah, it's the video version of the podcast.

2602
02:05:56.22 --> 02:05:57.22
Yes.

2603
02:05:57.22 --> 02:06:02.10
But I will take a little excerpts and we'll post those as well.

2604
02:06:02.10 --> 02:06:07.10
So you can, you know, if you're like, if you're into sharing little lessons with your

2605
02:06:07.10 --> 02:06:09.02
friends or coworkers, whatever you can do that.

2606
02:06:09.02 --> 02:06:10.70
So you don't have to share the whole podcast.

2607
02:06:10.70 --> 02:06:13.54
I'll put some other stuff on their interesting stuff.

2608
02:06:13.54 --> 02:06:16.02
I think we'll think of some other stuff.

2609
02:06:16.02 --> 02:06:17.74
Just in relation to it.

2610
02:06:17.74 --> 02:06:20.02
We've been spitballing about some stuff.

2611
02:06:20.02 --> 02:06:24.02
Anyway, if you want to see what that is, yeah, going YouTube, it's not like YouTube

2612
02:06:24.02 --> 02:06:26.66
costs money or does it?

2613
02:06:26.66 --> 02:06:27.66
No, it doesn't.

2614
02:06:27.66 --> 02:06:28.66
It's free.

2615
02:06:28.66 --> 02:06:29.66
YouTube read costs money.

2616
02:06:29.66 --> 02:06:30.66
Yeah.

2617
02:06:30.66 --> 02:06:31.66
We're not dealing with YouTube read.

2618
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:32.66
We're not doing it.

2619
02:06:32.66 --> 02:06:34.66
No, no, no, no.

2620
02:06:34.66 --> 02:06:35.66
Charge for content.

2621
02:06:35.66 --> 02:06:37.30
No, no, no, we're not going to do that.

2622
02:06:37.30 --> 02:06:38.30
No, no, no.

2623
02:06:38.30 --> 02:06:39.30
But I was thinking about getting YouTube read.

2624
02:06:39.30 --> 02:06:40.30
Oh, right.

2625
02:06:40.30 --> 02:06:41.66
Yeah, that's a whole other thing for sure.

2626
02:06:41.66 --> 02:06:43.30
But yeah, YouTube subscribe.

2627
02:06:43.30 --> 02:06:44.30
You're going to support that way.

2628
02:06:44.30 --> 02:06:45.30
That's cool.

2629
02:06:45.30 --> 02:06:47.50
Also, Jocco has a store.

2630
02:06:47.50 --> 02:06:49.78
It's called JoccoStore.

2631
02:06:49.78 --> 02:06:50.98
JoccoStore.com.

2632
02:06:50.98 --> 02:06:54.78
So this keeps forgetting everybody's name, but very clever guy.

2633
02:06:54.78 --> 02:06:58.26
So yeah, this was like, and then I went through it.

2634
02:06:58.26 --> 02:06:59.26
I was like, dang, I'm so bad.

2635
02:06:59.26 --> 02:07:00.66
I was like, oh, it's not a high coup.

2636
02:07:00.66 --> 02:07:02.82
Because you wasted the JoccoStore.

2637
02:07:02.82 --> 02:07:03.82
Yeah.

2638
02:07:03.82 --> 02:07:04.82
So why don't you change it?

2639
02:07:04.82 --> 02:07:05.82
So it's a high coup.

2640
02:07:05.82 --> 02:07:08.26
Because it might, yeah, I guess.

2641
02:07:08.26 --> 02:07:10.06
Okay, here we go.

2642
02:07:10.06 --> 02:07:15.46
Also, Jocco has a store.

2643
02:07:15.46 --> 02:07:18.46
It's called the JoccoStore.

2644
02:07:18.46 --> 02:07:19.46
JoccoStore.com.

2645
02:07:19.46 --> 02:07:21.46
Boom, there's a high coup.

2646
02:07:21.46 --> 02:07:23.78
Then the last JoccoStore.com, that's where you can get.

2647
02:07:23.78 --> 02:07:32.10
If you want shirts, rash cards, who it is?

2648
02:07:32.10 --> 02:07:34.86
Some patches, velcro, regulation size, and color.

2649
02:07:34.86 --> 02:07:36.42
Some women stuff on there.

2650
02:07:36.42 --> 02:07:40.78
Anyway, the point there is, if you like t-shirts, you want to represent, get a shirt.

2651
02:07:40.78 --> 02:07:42.58
Boom, good support.

2652
02:07:42.58 --> 02:07:43.58
They're good shirts, too.

2653
02:07:43.58 --> 02:07:44.58
They're not the free thing.

2654
02:07:44.58 --> 02:07:47.02
Put on, get after t-shirt.

2655
02:07:47.02 --> 02:07:48.02
Yeah.

2656
02:07:48.02 --> 02:07:49.66
Do you get a little bit?

2657
02:07:49.66 --> 02:07:51.34
Yeah, you want to get after it more.

2658
02:07:51.34 --> 02:07:54.66
And actually, that actually sounds kind of funny.

2659
02:07:54.66 --> 02:07:56.46
But when you think about it, it's super obvious.

2660
02:07:56.46 --> 02:08:02.34
So like, you know, like, I mean, it's a litter, it's a litterer.

2661
02:08:02.34 --> 02:08:03.34
Literature.

2662
02:08:03.34 --> 02:08:04.34
Thing.

2663
02:08:04.34 --> 02:08:06.26
There's a literature thing.

2664
02:08:06.26 --> 02:08:07.66
It's called something.

2665
02:08:07.66 --> 02:08:10.66
It's called something like the dressing of the warrior.

2666
02:08:10.66 --> 02:08:11.66
Yeah, yeah.

2667
02:08:11.66 --> 02:08:12.82
And you'll see in movies, they do movies.

2668
02:08:12.82 --> 02:08:14.54
We should have got putting his boots on.

2669
02:08:14.54 --> 02:08:17.74
And his gear on and putting his sword and his picking up his shield.

2670
02:08:17.74 --> 02:08:19.30
That's dawning his helmet.

2671
02:08:19.30 --> 02:08:25.46
They do it everywhere from night movies to gladiator movies to soldier movies in the modern

2672
02:08:25.46 --> 02:08:26.46
day.

2673
02:08:26.46 --> 02:08:29.22
You'll see these scenes while they do it in literature, too.

2674
02:08:29.22 --> 02:08:33.10
So there's a little something that there's a little reality that like, I'll tell you

2675
02:08:33.10 --> 02:08:37.74
what used to get me was flipping down, so night vision goggles, you wear them on your

2676
02:08:37.74 --> 02:08:38.74
helmet.

2677
02:08:38.74 --> 02:08:43.38
And they flip up when the lights are on when you're, you know, you're getting ready to

2678
02:08:43.38 --> 02:08:44.38
go.

2679
02:08:44.38 --> 02:08:45.38
Yeah.

2680
02:08:45.38 --> 02:08:50.98
It flipped down your nods and for me, like that was just game so game on.

2681
02:08:50.98 --> 02:08:53.62
It's so game on when you flip down those nods.

2682
02:08:53.62 --> 02:08:57.46
And so when we even got back from my last deployment, I'm working training and we'd

2683
02:08:57.46 --> 02:09:01.74
go, we'd still be on night vision, we'd go out at night to observe the troops and run the

2684
02:09:01.74 --> 02:09:03.66
opposing forces and all that.

2685
02:09:03.66 --> 02:09:09.30
But I get out on the target area and flip down my nods and I'd go in a full combat mode.

2686
02:09:09.30 --> 02:09:10.30
It's just so good.

2687
02:09:10.30 --> 02:09:12.70
So I think sometimes you put on the gear.

2688
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:15.54
You sort of feel like something.

2689
02:09:15.54 --> 02:09:16.54
Yeah.

2690
02:09:16.54 --> 02:09:21.60
Well, I think it was gladiator that movie when they're like, I don't know, it's like the

2691
02:09:21.60 --> 02:09:23.38
emperor or something came up.

2692
02:09:23.38 --> 02:09:27.22
And then there was like the small act of defiance from the gladiator guy and that all the guards

2693
02:09:27.22 --> 02:09:30.38
behind them, they all flipped down the thing and boom, we're ready to go real quick.

2694
02:09:30.38 --> 02:09:32.58
I think it's gladiator probably might have been something else.

2695
02:09:32.58 --> 02:09:36.86
Nonetheless, yeah, the modern version of that right with these like, and it did happen

2696
02:09:36.86 --> 02:09:39.98
to me when the, with the first shirts came in, the dislinicals freedom.

2697
02:09:39.98 --> 02:09:44.06
I was like, oh, the shirts are in that put it on and I wanted to like go work out in it.

2698
02:09:44.06 --> 02:09:47.58
You know, and they make sense when you get a new rash guard is like, where you get a

2699
02:09:47.58 --> 02:09:51.22
new gear, something like, oh, can't wait to go practice in my new geek kind of thing.

2700
02:09:51.22 --> 02:09:53.22
One of the little kids get new shoes.

2701
02:09:53.22 --> 02:09:54.66
Yeah, they got to get your right faster.

2702
02:09:54.66 --> 02:09:57.98
Yeah, and football, one we split in, pop Warner football.

2703
02:09:57.98 --> 02:09:59.42
We'd get the new shoes for the season.

2704
02:09:59.42 --> 02:10:01.42
I can't wait to go to practice practice super hard.

2705
02:10:01.42 --> 02:10:02.42
And so it sucks.

2706
02:10:02.42 --> 02:10:07.18
Especially as a little kid, but you just want to when you get that new stuff, nonetheless.

2707
02:10:07.18 --> 02:10:09.54
So like I said, jockels door.com.

2708
02:10:09.54 --> 02:10:11.42
Get yourself a new shirt.

2709
02:10:11.42 --> 02:10:13.14
You get the one that says get after it.

2710
02:10:13.14 --> 02:10:15.58
Guess what you're going to really want to do.

2711
02:10:15.58 --> 02:10:17.14
Get after it.

2712
02:10:17.14 --> 02:10:19.14
Some other ones on there.

2713
02:10:19.14 --> 02:10:20.14
Pretty cool.

2714
02:10:20.14 --> 02:10:21.14
I think.

2715
02:10:21.14 --> 02:10:22.14
And the good, their quality shirts.

2716
02:10:22.14 --> 02:10:23.14
That's in my opinion.

2717
02:10:23.14 --> 02:10:26.46
That's even more important than what it says on them.

2718
02:10:26.46 --> 02:10:27.46
Because they're wearable.

2719
02:10:27.46 --> 02:10:32.46
I can print like, yeah, jockels cool saying, so on a junk shirt.

2720
02:10:32.46 --> 02:10:35.42
You wear it one time you're like, all right, you know, maybe I'll wear that again.

2721
02:10:35.42 --> 02:10:36.42
But it's not very wearable.

2722
02:10:36.42 --> 02:10:37.86
I don't look that good in it.

2723
02:10:37.86 --> 02:10:39.54
It's not the case with these ones.

2724
02:10:39.54 --> 02:10:40.54
These ones look good.

2725
02:10:40.54 --> 02:10:43.46
I've had multiple people say it's my favorite shirt to wear.

2726
02:10:43.46 --> 02:10:50.18
Because I look good in that kind of occasion with the first round of travel mugs.

2727
02:10:50.18 --> 02:10:51.58
The silver ones.

2728
02:10:51.58 --> 02:10:52.58
Oh, yeah.

2729
02:10:52.58 --> 02:10:57.18
Like they were not as high quality as what we went to.

2730
02:10:57.18 --> 02:10:58.18
Yeah.

2731
02:10:58.18 --> 02:10:59.78
They said, they said, just put in cool freedom.

2732
02:10:59.78 --> 02:11:00.78
Yeah.

2733
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:03.18
In the silver mugs, they said, just put in cool freedom.

2734
02:11:03.18 --> 02:11:05.98
They looked pretty cool.

2735
02:11:05.98 --> 02:11:08.50
But we needed higher quality.

2736
02:11:08.50 --> 02:11:09.50
Yeah.

2737
02:11:09.50 --> 02:11:10.50
Yeah.

2738
02:11:10.50 --> 02:11:11.50
So yeah, essentially the same thing.

2739
02:11:11.50 --> 02:11:12.50
You get the mug.

2740
02:11:12.50 --> 02:11:13.50
You're like cool.

2741
02:11:13.50 --> 02:11:14.50
I can't even try again.

2742
02:11:14.50 --> 02:11:21.70
This is going to be a whole cup covered straight up.

2743
02:11:21.70 --> 02:11:22.70
It did with me.

2744
02:11:22.70 --> 02:11:24.26
And I didn't even expect that.

2745
02:11:24.26 --> 02:11:26.38
But yeah, 30 ounces.

2746
02:11:26.38 --> 02:11:28.30
And if it's in your cup holder in your car, too.

2747
02:11:28.30 --> 02:11:29.70
What's the black on black?

2748
02:11:29.70 --> 02:11:30.70
Black on black on black.

2749
02:11:30.70 --> 02:11:32.58
Dispunicles freedom.

2750
02:11:32.58 --> 02:11:35.10
No one can see it except for you.

2751
02:11:35.10 --> 02:11:36.50
Well, the owner.

2752
02:11:36.50 --> 02:11:37.50
No, you can see it.

2753
02:11:37.50 --> 02:11:38.94
Here's a good thing about it.

2754
02:11:38.94 --> 02:11:39.94
It's black.

2755
02:11:39.94 --> 02:11:40.74
It's easy to see.

2756
02:11:40.74 --> 02:11:41.34
Look at it.

2757
02:11:41.34 --> 02:11:42.06
It's black.

2758
02:11:42.06 --> 02:11:42.90
It's not shiny.

2759
02:11:42.90 --> 02:11:43.74
It's black.

2760
02:11:43.74 --> 02:11:44.74
It's black.

2761
02:11:44.74 --> 02:11:45.74
It's shiny black.

2762
02:11:45.74 --> 02:11:47.74
And then yeah, then the logo and stuff is shiny black.

2763
02:11:47.74 --> 02:11:49.62
So people have to look a little extra hard to see it.

2764
02:11:49.62 --> 02:11:50.62
Yeah.

2765
02:11:50.62 --> 02:11:51.90
But there's a subtle T2 at that.

2766
02:11:51.90 --> 02:11:52.90
Yeah.

2767
02:11:52.90 --> 02:11:53.90
It's powerful.

2768
02:11:53.90 --> 02:11:54.90
It's for you.

2769
02:11:54.90 --> 02:11:55.90
It looks dope.

2770
02:11:55.90 --> 02:11:56.90
They called it murdered out.

2771
02:11:56.90 --> 02:11:58.34
And the car is black with black ribs.

2772
02:11:58.34 --> 02:11:59.34
You know what?

2773
02:11:59.34 --> 02:12:00.34
It looks good.

2774
02:12:00.34 --> 02:12:01.34
And it's double insulated.

2775
02:12:01.34 --> 02:12:02.34
It's that double insulated stuff.

2776
02:12:02.34 --> 02:12:03.34
What is called?

2777
02:12:03.34 --> 02:12:04.34
Yeah.

2778
02:12:04.34 --> 02:12:05.98
You put ice water in there.

2779
02:12:05.98 --> 02:12:06.98
You leave it overnight.

2780
02:12:06.98 --> 02:12:08.98
Next morning, still you still have ice water.

2781
02:12:08.98 --> 02:12:10.06
Even if it's a hot night.

2782
02:12:10.06 --> 02:12:11.46
Even if it's a hot day outside.

2783
02:12:11.46 --> 02:12:12.46
It's amazing.

2784
02:12:12.46 --> 02:12:13.46
It's amazing.

2785
02:12:13.46 --> 02:12:15.14
I love my name, my car.

2786
02:12:15.14 --> 02:12:16.14
You know, you go into it.

2787
02:12:16.14 --> 02:12:17.14
Where did I go?

2788
02:12:17.14 --> 02:12:18.14
Your grocery store?

2789
02:12:18.14 --> 02:12:19.14
No.

2790
02:12:19.14 --> 02:12:20.54
You spend a lot of time in the grocery store.

2791
02:12:20.54 --> 02:12:21.54
No.

2792
02:12:21.54 --> 02:12:22.54
No.

2793
02:12:22.54 --> 02:12:23.54
No.

2794
02:12:23.54 --> 02:12:24.54
No.

2795
02:12:24.54 --> 02:12:26.18
I was coming back from somewhere, left it in my car.

2796
02:12:26.18 --> 02:12:27.34
With it, it was just ice.

2797
02:12:27.34 --> 02:12:28.98
I drank all the water.

2798
02:12:28.98 --> 02:12:32.14
And left it in my car.

2799
02:12:32.14 --> 02:12:34.74
It came out later that evening.

2800
02:12:34.74 --> 02:12:36.02
But I still have a car.

2801
02:12:36.02 --> 02:12:37.02
That's it.

2802
02:12:37.02 --> 02:12:38.02
It's amazing.

2803
02:12:38.02 --> 02:12:39.02
It's a miracle.

2804
02:12:39.02 --> 02:12:40.02
Anyway, those are good high quality.

2805
02:12:40.02 --> 02:12:41.02
PPA free.

2806
02:12:41.02 --> 02:12:42.02
All that stuff.

2807
02:12:42.02 --> 02:12:45.90
Anyway, drop us a start.com if you didn't know already.

2808
02:12:45.90 --> 02:12:50.02
Also, good way to support yourself and this podcast.

2809
02:12:50.02 --> 02:12:51.02
By happens.

2810
02:12:51.02 --> 02:12:54.54
It is psychological warfare is what it's called.

2811
02:12:54.54 --> 02:12:58.70
If you know what that is, it's an album with tracks of Jockel telling you how to get

2812
02:12:58.70 --> 02:13:04.58
through your moments of weakness in the event of you having a moment of weakness, getting

2813
02:13:04.58 --> 02:13:08.50
up early, procrastinating, even being created.

2814
02:13:08.50 --> 02:13:09.58
It's like for everything.

2815
02:13:09.58 --> 02:13:10.58
Being creative.

2816
02:13:10.58 --> 02:13:16.10
Like how can you get talked out of writer's block?

2817
02:13:16.10 --> 02:13:17.82
How can you get talked out of that?

2818
02:13:17.82 --> 02:13:18.82
It's weird, right?

2819
02:13:18.82 --> 02:13:22.22
You will be talked out of writer's block and write into creativity.

2820
02:13:22.22 --> 02:13:23.22
Yes, exactly.

2821
02:13:23.22 --> 02:13:24.22
And same thing with workouts.

2822
02:13:24.22 --> 02:13:28.66
Anyway, for all the little moments of weakness that you might have,

2823
02:13:28.66 --> 02:13:30.02
don't worry, Jockel's there.

2824
02:13:30.02 --> 02:13:31.02
Get it.

2825
02:13:31.02 --> 02:13:32.02
Psychological warfare.

2826
02:13:32.02 --> 02:13:33.62
You can even buy the individual tracks, too.

2827
02:13:33.62 --> 02:13:36.94
Let's say you're like, just, no, but that's not as good of a deal.

2828
02:13:36.94 --> 02:13:39.78
But I mean, really, nine, nine cents.

2829
02:13:39.78 --> 02:13:40.78
Yes, it is a good deal.

2830
02:13:40.78 --> 02:13:41.78
It's a great deal.

2831
02:13:41.78 --> 02:13:44.98
Regardless, in my opinion, because, okay, my whole thing wasn't the wake up early.

2832
02:13:44.98 --> 02:13:47.42
It was going from not working out to work in hot.

2833
02:13:47.42 --> 02:13:49.54
It's like, okay, I gotta work out today.

2834
02:13:49.54 --> 02:13:50.54
But I'm on the computer.

2835
02:13:50.54 --> 02:13:51.54
I'm doing something.

2836
02:13:51.54 --> 02:13:53.34
I'm like, this is important to me.

2837
02:13:53.34 --> 02:13:54.34
Exactly.

2838
02:13:54.34 --> 02:13:55.58
I should really focus on my craft.

2839
02:13:55.58 --> 02:13:56.58
Yeah.

2840
02:13:56.58 --> 02:13:57.58
Yeah.

2841
02:13:57.58 --> 02:13:59.46
The workout day becomes a rest day.

2842
02:13:59.46 --> 02:14:04.34
You know, in prompt two, you know, kind of, and that was kind of my thing.

2843
02:14:04.34 --> 02:14:08.74
But so there's a track for that, you know?

2844
02:14:08.74 --> 02:14:12.58
So if all I need is really that track, the diet thing, I'm not, you know, that weak

2845
02:14:12.58 --> 02:14:14.14
when it comes to the diet stuff.

2846
02:14:14.14 --> 02:14:15.74
So you know, so maybe I don't need it.

2847
02:14:15.74 --> 02:14:16.98
But I'm not saying to do that.

2848
02:14:16.98 --> 02:14:18.62
I'm saying, there's that option.

2849
02:14:18.62 --> 02:14:19.62
So you get to want it.

2850
02:14:19.62 --> 02:14:20.62
It's on iTunes.

2851
02:14:20.62 --> 02:14:24.02
It's on Amazon Music.

2852
02:14:24.02 --> 02:14:25.02
Google Play.

2853
02:14:25.02 --> 02:14:26.02
Google Play.

2854
02:14:26.02 --> 02:14:27.34
Pretty much anywhere where they sell music.

2855
02:14:27.34 --> 02:14:28.34
Google Play.

2856
02:14:28.34 --> 02:14:29.34
Online MP3's.

2857
02:14:29.34 --> 02:14:30.34
Boom.

2858
02:14:30.34 --> 02:14:31.34
It's on there.

2859
02:14:31.34 --> 02:14:32.34
It's called like people that want alarm clocks.

2860
02:14:32.34 --> 02:14:33.34
People that want alarm clocks.

2861
02:14:33.34 --> 02:14:34.34
People that want an alarm clock.

2862
02:14:34.34 --> 02:14:35.34
Oh, a ringtone.

2863
02:14:35.34 --> 02:14:36.34
Yeah.

2864
02:14:36.34 --> 02:14:37.34
Just put it.

2865
02:14:37.34 --> 02:14:38.34
No, no.

2866
02:14:38.34 --> 02:14:39.34
A alarm clock.

2867
02:14:39.34 --> 02:14:40.34
If you want to wake up.

2868
02:14:40.34 --> 02:14:42.34
Did like someone telling you to get up.

2869
02:14:42.34 --> 02:14:44.34
And that someone's going to get your hot couple.

2870
02:14:44.34 --> 02:14:45.34
Yes.

2871
02:14:45.34 --> 02:14:46.34
People want me to do something like that.

2872
02:14:46.34 --> 02:14:47.34
But I'm like, we already did it.

2873
02:14:47.34 --> 02:14:49.34
That's one of the reasons why we did this cycle.

2874
02:14:49.34 --> 02:14:50.34
It's a warfare.

2875
02:14:50.34 --> 02:14:51.34
Yeah.

2876
02:14:51.34 --> 02:14:54.34
So yeah, you download that specific file to your phone and then you, yeah, you'll play.

2877
02:14:54.34 --> 02:14:55.34
Make it do.

2878
02:14:55.34 --> 02:14:56.34
Yeah.

2879
02:14:56.34 --> 02:14:57.34
Yeah.

2880
02:14:57.34 --> 02:14:59.34
So the logical warfare, juggle willing.

2881
02:14:59.34 --> 02:15:04.22
You can also get juggle white tea on Amazon.

2882
02:15:04.22 --> 02:15:07.98
And people ask if I ever drink energy drinks.

2883
02:15:07.98 --> 02:15:09.62
And the answer is yes.

2884
02:15:09.62 --> 02:15:11.62
A drink juggle white tea.

2885
02:15:11.62 --> 02:15:13.62
It's my energy drink.

2886
02:15:13.62 --> 02:15:14.62
Sure.

2887
02:15:14.62 --> 02:15:16.62
No need any other energy drinks.

2888
02:15:16.62 --> 02:15:19.78
That actually sap your energy.

2889
02:15:19.78 --> 02:15:23.30
Once their crash hits you.

2890
02:15:23.30 --> 02:15:24.30
Talk away to you.

2891
02:15:24.30 --> 02:15:25.30
That's not going to happen.

2892
02:15:25.30 --> 02:15:26.30
You'll be going strong.

2893
02:15:26.30 --> 02:15:27.80
Way the warrior kid.

2894
02:15:27.80 --> 02:15:29.54
The book.

2895
02:15:29.54 --> 02:15:34.26
I wish I had when I was a kid that shows kids the path.

2896
02:15:34.26 --> 02:15:39.82
You can get that book as well as for adults that we need to get on the path.

2897
02:15:39.82 --> 02:15:42.58
There's another book coming out October 20, 2017.

2898
02:15:42.58 --> 02:15:44.66
Discipline equals freedom field manual.

2899
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:45.66
It's the path.

2900
02:15:45.66 --> 02:15:47.34
That's it.

2901
02:15:47.34 --> 02:15:48.34
Extreme ownership.

2902
02:15:48.34 --> 02:15:53.14
Of course, combat leadership from the battlefield and translated into strategies and

2903
02:15:53.14 --> 02:15:56.98
tactics that can be applied in any leadership situation.

2904
02:15:56.98 --> 02:15:58.98
Extreme ownership.

2905
02:15:58.98 --> 02:16:04.14
Get it and then get it.

2906
02:16:04.14 --> 02:16:10.54
Also, you can also get echelon front leadership and management consulting into your company.

2907

And you got me.

2911
02:16:16.50 --> 02:16:20.54
You can contact us at info at echelonfront.com.

2912
02:16:20.54 --> 02:16:25.90
Of course, the master leadership conference, but not your normal conference.

2913
02:16:25.90 --> 02:16:27.90
It's not your normal conference.

2914
02:16:27.90 --> 02:16:31.58
So don't whatever you're vision of a conference is I've spoken at a bunch of conferences.

2915
02:16:31.58 --> 02:16:33.30
That conference, it's not that.

2916
02:16:33.30 --> 02:16:34.30
It's different.

2917
02:16:34.30 --> 02:16:35.30
It's different.

2918
02:16:35.30 --> 02:16:38.94
The normal conference, you're waiting for the break and then you're going to disappear

2919
02:16:38.94 --> 02:16:41.30
to your hotel room for like 45 minutes.

2920
02:16:41.30 --> 02:16:42.50
Waiting for the happy hour.

2921
02:16:42.50 --> 02:16:43.50
All that other stuff.

2922
02:16:43.50 --> 02:16:45.86
That's not what we're doing here.

2923
02:16:45.86 --> 02:16:49.06
The conference at the master.

2924
02:16:49.06 --> 02:16:51.58
The master starts today at clock in the morning.

2925
02:16:51.58 --> 02:16:54.02
Everyone's there at 7 o'clock in the morning.

2926
02:16:54.02 --> 02:16:58.78
After we get done with PT, everyone's there at 7 o'clock in the morning, including all

2927
02:16:58.78 --> 02:17:01.54
of us, we're hanging out.

2928
02:17:01.54 --> 02:17:03.66
When we started at 8 o'clock, we started at 8 o'clock.

2929
02:17:03.66 --> 02:17:04.74
Boom, it's go time.

2930
02:17:04.74 --> 02:17:09.30
So it's not just your typical conference thing.

2931
02:17:09.30 --> 02:17:12.50
We get after it knowledge, interaction, solving problems.

2932
02:17:12.50 --> 02:17:14.26
We go and we go hard.

2933
02:17:14.26 --> 02:17:15.62
I just peaked out the microphone.

2934
02:17:15.62 --> 02:17:16.62
I don't do that normally.

2935
02:17:16.62 --> 02:17:18.62
But we go and we go hard.

2936
02:17:18.62 --> 02:17:24.94
Next one is an August, or sorry, an Austin, Texas, July 13th and 14th at the Omni Barton

2937
02:17:24.94 --> 02:17:32.70
Crink Resort, which only has 300 people, where over halfway sold out right now.

2938
02:17:32.70 --> 02:17:34.86
Register quickly.

2939
02:17:34.86 --> 02:17:39.70
If you can't make that, you can come to San Diego, September 14th and 15th for

2940
02:17:39.70 --> 02:17:41.70
Master 004.

2941
02:17:41.70 --> 02:17:45.06
We look forward to seeing you there.

2942
02:17:45.06 --> 02:17:51.22
And until we do see you there, if you want to talk to us, you can find us drifting about

2943
02:17:51.22 --> 02:17:59.62
inside the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on that face-y bull.

2944
02:17:59.62 --> 02:18:06.26
Echo is at Echo Charles, and I am at Jocca Willink and as always, to the military personnel

2945
02:18:06.26 --> 02:18:10.02
deployed all over the world.

2946
02:18:10.02 --> 02:18:18.38
Thanks for everything that you do for us, to the police, firefighters, EMTs, first responders,

2947
02:18:18.38 --> 02:18:24.62
thanks for keeping us safe and make sure you stay safe as well to everyone else that's

2948
02:18:24.62 --> 02:18:26.82
listening.

2949
02:18:26.82 --> 02:18:29.22
Thank you for listening.

2950
02:18:29.22 --> 02:18:30.22
Thank you for supporting.

2951
02:18:30.22 --> 02:18:34.02
Thank you for spreading the word.

2952
02:18:34.02 --> 02:18:36.14
Thank you for getting up early.

2953
02:18:36.14 --> 02:18:40.62
And thanks for working harder than your enemy.

2954
02:18:40.62 --> 02:18:48.70
And as Echo said earlier, thanks for taking advantage of when times are good because

2955
02:18:48.70 --> 02:18:55.54
times will not always be good.

2956
02:18:55.54 --> 02:19:00.90
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

2957
02:19:00.90 --> 02:19:09.86
See another episode of Echo, an 833 infection patient.

2958
02:19:09.86 --> 02:19:14.54
Hello!

2959
02:19:14.54 --> 02:19:23.30
Now.
