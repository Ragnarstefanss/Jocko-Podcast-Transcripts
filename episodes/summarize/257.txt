but we had gone through a large portion of special forces training together back at four brag it's through training that you really get to know someone I knew I could always count on Jason for help there were times I felt like I was a fish out of water coming over from the air force the army but Jason took the time to help me whenever I got hung up on one ever part of training I was stuck with Jason was someone I looked up to I admired how everything was easy for him he was smart and great shape a super dad to his kids and amazing husband to his wife but just two months into his first deployment as a green beret he was dead in the past I had heard about guys from a different battalion or unit dying and I rack her Afghanistan but this was the first time I knew someone personally death in combat was not just something I saw in the news now it was personal Jason was my friend and this was the ugly reality of war I tried my best not to think about Jason's death too much which was difficult I knew full well that Afghanistan was not the place to mourn the death of friends there would be plenty of time back in the states to think about that and try to come to terms with it I still had a job to do to make sure no one on my team stepped on an IED and a promise to fulfill to myself I would do whatever it took to make sure my teammates returned with to their families in one piece in 2010 though Afghanistan was not getting safer and the real fighting had yet to begin how long did you guys been on deployment for at that point so when Jason was killed I think we both got in the country at the same time and so that would be two months and how long are you how long were your deployments at this point um they were they varied but most of them were nine months at that at that point so you're only two months into a nine month deployment you've already your your battalions lost a bunch of guys your companies how did guys wounded and killed that your friend gets killed go and back to the book when summer was coming to a close my team along with other ODAs from our company was tasked with entering Choo-Too Valley I say that right yep from different locations and clearing out the Taliban to a central point which would send the bastards running for the mountains working against us however was the fact that this was not a covert mission everyone up and down the valley knew we were coming which gave the Taliban ample time to place IEDs and prepare for us so you go you talk through some of the planning and finally you guys go to execute this mission the date was September 10th 2010 each of us was carrying a different equipment carrying different equipment for the mission besides my body armor and amphal rifle I was toting a 60 pound assault pack on my back filled with ammunition demolition material food water extra batteries and whatever else I would need for three days my average fighting weight was 200 pounds but with body armor weapons ammo and my assault pack I probably took the scales at 280 280s being generous and you know the discussions still going on a few seconds later the Afghan commandos tugged on my shirt sleeve to get my attention again the men are heading this way we need to do something because I don't think these are villagers from the area he said I went back to my team sergeant was more direct we need to get out of here we have fighting age males moving in our direction I'm grabbing my guys and getting into positions to move out the team sergeant not not it fuck this he said I'm done to go she ate with these guys let's move out he had barely finished this sentence when the first shot was by my head with the all two familiar zip followed by a crack we were immediately in the fight for our lives rounds were coming in all round from automatic machine gunfire series of RPG explosions took us by total surprise everything turned into total chaos in an instant everything was happening so fast it was impossible for the human brain to comprehend it instinctively I knew I was sprinting for cover but for a split second I felt frozen in pandemonium of everything happening around me while my brain scrambled to make sense of the attacks ferocity now I was moving quickly screaming instructions and returning fired an enemy I could not see round sprayed everywhere hitting compound walls like a garden hose watering down a dusty road just then I heard a grunt as if you was hurt that was that's one of your afghans but for some reason it didn't occur to me that he could have been hit I darted toward a ditch that paralleled the dirt road running through the village after diving for cover I peered out cautiously but I couldn't see any of my guys or where we were taking fire from bullets were telling up dirt all around me as we tried to stay as low as possible then I noticed that three commandos in the ditch ten meters from my position had drawn the attention of a towel band machine gun crew that had zeroed in on them I waved for the three afghans to move to my position which would give them more cover but they were too scared to move I knew that if they didn't get their asses in gear and start moving they were gonna die I don't know what possessed me but I climbed out from my ditch and sprinted to their position praying to God that my adaptive leg would hold up I reached the first commando and grabbed the very first thing that I could get a hold of his hair I yanked him out up and pulled him back to my ditch holding the other two would follow they did as we ran dust kicked up and more rounds impacted around us I slid into the ditch like I was licking out a triple you know it's not like you're warm cuddly there either now no the uh just beat down we just we're not under the water and that was good as the days turned into weeks our bodies are breaking down so I pressed on as we near the end the final major obstacle in my way was along rut march we weren't supposed to know the distance of the final trek but every selection class got the scoop from the guys are gone before we would be going 25 to 30 miles turned out you guys went more than 25 to 30 miles again I'm jumping you you give some really cool information and that's why people should get the book fast foreign a little bit after hitting the finish line we gathered in a large conference hall to hear who got selected and who didn't I could barely put one foot in front of the other but at least I walked in under my own power those left standing after the dust cleared look like they had spent years as POWs most of the guys hobbled and limp their way into the conference hall beaten down and on edge as I took my seat my tired head was filled with questions will all this physical and mental effort be for nothing did I give it the best I could do I have what they are looking for after a wait that seemed like days the selection cadre entered the hall to call off the roster numbers of the guys selected I was roster number 049 out of 185 as you went down the list he reached those in the 40s I held my breath and closed my eyes roster number 049 selected I melted into my chairs the reef spread over my body out of 185 only 50 or so men were selected a little more than one out of every four I was one of them so finally you get the call from Ben let's move out guys we slowly charged our way toward the village of sar-tutu in the distance sar-tutu is made up of several mud-hut compounds in my group was tasked with clearing one of the sections keeping strict noise and like discipline we scan the hillside and the riverbank for any movement I kept my thumb on my weapon safety selector reddish switch to engage to kill the enemy taking fire from the Taliban was a risk we all knew as possible but the more likely scenario was experiencing a catastrophic ied explosion resulting in the loss of limbs and broken bodies all the team members were fully aware that one wrong step could change their lives forever my job was to make sure that did not happen these insidious bombs could be hidden anywhere buried in the ground hung in trees stashed in cooking pots inside the carcasses of that animals within car trunks are under clothing with the infamous strap-on suicide vests while they might have been built with fertilizer and discarded spare parts and look like a junior high school shop class project i never underestimated the lethality of these homemade bombs all i took was a handful all it took was a handful of high explosives a few inches of copper wire in a battery that nation could be triggered by compression the weight of a soldier or vehicle passing over the explosive charge remote control with cell phones or an electrical circuit from a distance the Taliban were limited only by their imagination which was limitless when it came to killing Americans moving up we intercepted a radio transmission from the Taliban indicating that they knew we were on the move and could see us at first the news made my heart race my palms got sweaty as my arm as my eyes darted around looking for anything slightly abnormal i felt i was starting to see things that really weren't there were my eyes playing tricks on me or my ears it seemed like i was curing all sorts of things when we stopped to get our bearings the guys called this hypervintulence hypervigilance and told me that when danger was imminent your senses rose up several notches to high alert status fueling the high percent activity was an overwhelming desire to stay alive the village was deserted when we entered one thing every sf guy knew you know you're in the bottom of your your in the bottom of the ninth just like you said so it's like you need to you need you need to do some management expectation here because like start thinking about other things start you know what are you gonna do with your life out of the military and stuff like that yep uh which ends up in a pretty quick divorce and at this point you you you write this in the book I needed a win a big win I was never the type to give up but with two blown marriages a failed attempt to become a navy seal and a feeling that I hadn't found my calling in life I was just settling and letting life run me ragged I needed to reset my failures with a major victory that was when I decided that there would be no more losing it was time to start winning again at the time the air force was overmaned in certain jobs ammo being one of them the army had a shortage of soldiers in certain career fields so the air force was offering a direct transfer to the army one thing my dad had told me years earlier kept nagging me if you don't try you'll never know and if you never know it's because you didn't try the answer was clear I wasn't going to live a life of regrets even if the high risk of failure was there after clearing my head I decided to jump head first eyes closed into the unknown that's you know you want to talk about there being a plan the fact that the air force was overmaned and the army would just do a direct transfer and now he could sit back and relish his golden month moments and wonderful memories because he had lived life to the fullest so there you go son I wish I would have done this or that statements are a prison of misery for the mind you want to go through life and be perfectly content with the life you've lived you want to do everything there is to be done right or wrong you do it and never regret a decision you made this from a man who'd been off to war fought for his life seen the world given life taken life loved and had his heart broken he had made mistakes taken chances and failed and succeeded many times good or bad I can sit back and reminisce on my life and feel good about it he said when God tells me it's my time to go home I will leave this earth fulfilled because I've done it all and I want you to feel the same way so let me leave you with this thought what kind of old man do you want to be son freaking good guidance from the from from pops you know and that's that's hard to come back from you know what I really like about what you just said I really like the fact that you just because you know everyone talks about lifestyle in like a positive thing like let's a Gigi to lifestyle it's a healthy lifestyle i so maybe came aware of the pain it was solely creeping in like a snake squeezing his victim to death i reached down from my left leg and wiggled it leg was still there bloody but still there when i tried to move my right leg however the pain was unbearable waving the sand and dust away with my hands to get a better view i could see my right combat boot was bent at a weird 90 degree angle it was like my combat boot made a T at the end of my leg the didn't seem possible that my leather boot could be twisted like that so i grabbed my right leg behind my right knee and lifted to get a better look as i raised my right leg up a tad my right foot flopped off to the side of my leg so when uh we'll we'll go back to the book here for the first time in my life I experienced a major setback becoming part of an elite unit with something I wanted with every inch of my being but I couldn't make the cut which prompted a series of questions why did I fail why wasn't I good enough how come my body broke down was I that weak I had no answers and I came up with every every poor me excuse in the book you'd think that for a guy who is raised the way I was excuses would be the last thing on my mind but they were my crutch I slowly but steadily turned myself into a victim if only I didn't grow up in a broken family if only the world and everyone in it weren't against me that just wasn't about buds but me not making it through brought my buried demons to the surface so even at this point you know you don't make it through buds and you kind of blame all these you know hate so because I was raised this way I hadn't used you know my death my mom wasn't around and you kind of make those excuses for yourself and there was a couple people that surprised me when they quit there was one guy in my bloods class that was like a he had gone to buds before he was in E5 he was probably like 25 or 26 years old which seemed pretty freaking old to me and like mature because I was still like not you know I don't think it all he's got this stuff off and if you let that if you if you if you continually do that if you continually to kind of shun and turn your back on everything that is a challenge you know like you could have done this like you know being in this freaking special operations you know after you after you didn't make it through buds you'd be like so I basically I had all of these notes I're not notes, but I had all these pages of my life 500 and some odd and I had a couple you know I had reorganized it to kind of like the organization in the book and had a couple people like Frankie and Mike read it and they were like This is me like it. i'll pull one little quote you say so i'm out of patrol trying to find i.e. my damn metal detector wasn't working so i closed my eyes and stomped around to clear the root boom found one mission success you say here i've been to germany many times during my military career but this time it felt different because i was fresh off the battlefield to Afghanistan i finally felt safe from the aircraft landed no longer a dangerous part of the world i could finally relax or so i thought what i didn't know is it now i'd have plenty of time to actually think about everything that had happened to me i would also have time to cry over my friends who didn't make it home alive the ones placed into coffins for the one way flight to dover air force base in Delaware a grim trip the no one wants to take out of time to think about the families torn apart because of war either because they lost a loved one or their soldier was coming home with a mangled body never to be the same again that was my situation as well i knew i was never going to be the same again all right um again jumping ahead here where you end up at broke army medical center he's like I'm not even gonna justify that question with an answer It's kind of like that you kind of feel that only because you know though, but he was a thing that's a good question But all these are good question and also it's a good question because the chances that You go through the effort to make actually make something and spend the time in effort and money to make something that's Actually good for you the chances of that are rare. but you know you can catch yourself and it's I think it's funny what is drop foot like it's like it's like it's like the nerve that makes you lift up your foot gets damaged and so your foot just kind of has done And you know you you again, it's really good because in this book you go through some of the details of what's happening when you come home from deployment you know You have that kind of What is it little empty feeling that we get something like that and you're trying to fill it up you're trying to figure out You know what this is how how to adjust back to being in Florida or wherever you're gonna be So you're doing You're doing the path which is easily available to us when we come home which is drinking fighting causing problems we had cleared another 15 meters of path when I saw movement in an open field near the first compound I turned to Abe and Abe is one of your guys that you had with you one of your one of your afghans that you had with you and that was when it all hell broke out before Abe could respond the night was lit up by a barrage of gunfire coming from the compounds outer wall first it was a zip zip zip followed by the crack of 762 caliber rounds flying past our heads these rounds which rip holes in the darkness looked like a laser light show with tracer streaking across the night sky next came an explosion from an RPG being fired at us then more automatic fire we'd walk directly into an ambush shit with my heart beating out of my chest I hit the ground and started returning fire the Taliban the Taliban had set up a complex ambush ambush and the trip wire IED was supposed to start the whole thing off one of their pk machine guns let out a burst of 20 meters a burst of fire 20 meters from our position a distance so close that it was almost like I could grab the flame coming out of the end of the barrel jawede Abe and booze molla how do you say that best bezzmula bismula jump into the ditch well cahan I'm what whenever I talk of that some people especially when people get out I'm like when you get out of the when you get out of the military you need a new mission you need to have something else to focus on but what's weird about this is you are in the military but the mission that you had whatever that mission was it like wasn't bringing you the satisfaction you didn't feel like it was what you should be doing you know you knew that you had more to offer and so you're traveling around you're looking for you're looking for the mission and you just couldn't find it and it did and it wasn't until i stepped on that iED that i was actually able to get control of my life again what are the biggest things you thought what was what was like the core issue that you were running from what like was pent up in you that made you that you think like steered you in these directions where you would be being a tear people down like what do you think made Maybe we could and we don't need to but yes little excerpts you want to share with your friend bull me show the excerpt all good And let's face the fact some of the excerpts have explosions have fire have smoke have all kinds of things that echo Lakers lasers just those kind of things if you're into that kind of stuff Which one of the people that are speaking on this podcast right now is into Maybe you too YouTube channel look at that one um is subscribe if you want to also Psychological or for if you know what that is that's an album attracts of jockel helping you through moments of weakness If they may arise in your life, which I think from most of us they do from time to time So boom, check just check that out and and if you want some visual representation of that then you can go to flipside canvas.com but I'm good man I answered I couldn't believe what it just happened how big of a bomb was that 500 pounds brother used a big one man and I'm still alive I thought I had come away without a scratch until I felt warm liquid coming out of my ears from the monstrous blast damn that was close there was no time to worry about my the ear drip because I had no idea if the enemy was still moving around or all tapped out I took a moment to shake the cobwebs out of my head then I checked on my guys to ensure they were good after everyone was accounted for un-injured I had my guys fall back to the closest position which was 20 meters behind us once we were back with the main element our jatac called in another strike which would ensure that if anyone was still moving in the compound they were sure to be dead damn that's uh that's freaking psycho crazy right there dropping a 500 pound bomb at 20 meters like I said that's and someone goes over to disarm it and they step on something else to get blown up yep the decoys the decoys are nasty super nasty and that that goes back to that you know that saying that we've all had and I guarantee you guys probably said it in remodie was where there's one there's five you know you know where there's one there could be ten or what but where there's one there's gonna be secondary because when that guy hits one of them then the rescue teams gonna come in and they're gonna start hitting the secondarys or we're gonna use one as a decoy
