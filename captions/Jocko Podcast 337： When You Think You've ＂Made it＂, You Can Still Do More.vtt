1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.20
This is Jockelpontcast number 337 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.

2
00:00:05.20 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening, Jockel.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.20
We had planned to take down an insurgent cell known to be located in three or four buildings

4
00:00:14.20 --> 00:00:17.40
in a village overrun with SUNY extremists.

5
00:00:17.40 --> 00:00:23.52
I was one of the four seals on the outskirts making sure the area was clear before establishing

6
00:00:23.52 --> 00:00:26.20
the command and control position.

7
00:00:26.20 --> 00:00:34.92
Suddenly, through my grainy green night vision goggles, I saw a family, a mom, a dad, a

8
00:00:34.92 --> 00:00:41.76
ten-year-old kid, and a baby sleeping outside a shack on a two-foot high platform.

9
00:00:41.76 --> 00:00:46.64
This wasn't entirely unusual given the middle of the night heat and I rack families off

10
00:00:46.64 --> 00:00:49.32
and slept outside.

11
00:00:49.32 --> 00:00:53.60
But something about this situation felt off to me.

12
00:00:53.60 --> 00:00:56.48
I saw the father start to reach for something.

13
00:00:56.48 --> 00:00:58.64
Instinct told me this was bad.

14
00:00:58.64 --> 00:01:04.44
I spoke firmly and clearly to the guy behind me calling his name, Joel, Joel, Joel, so he

15
00:01:04.44 --> 00:01:10.20
would know that I was about to make a move and cover me.

16
00:01:10.20 --> 00:01:15.92
And I held the Iraqi man in my crosshairs, ready to shoot him at any moment as I rushed

17
00:01:15.92 --> 00:01:23.20
as fast as I could toward him before he could grab what did turn out to be a weapon.

18
00:01:23.20 --> 00:01:28.16
He was reaching for an AK rifle, just as I put my foot on his arm so he wouldn't be able

19
00:01:28.16 --> 00:01:32.36
to point the weapon at me or any of my teammates.

20
00:01:32.36 --> 00:01:37.52
Then I quickly put my muzzle on his chest and subdued him and it listed Joel's help

21
00:01:37.52 --> 00:01:41.56
to properly detain him with flex cuffs.

22
00:01:41.56 --> 00:01:44.08
I could have shot him at any time.

23
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:49.52
But as I first approached him, I didn't know for sure that he was armed and my instant

24
00:01:49.52 --> 00:01:54.44
and instinctive calculation made me confident that I would be fast enough to get him before

25
00:01:54.44 --> 00:02:00.80
he could take a shot at me or anyone else if he did have a weapon.

26
00:02:00.80 --> 00:02:06.04
It turned out that the AK was fully loaded and he had three magazines.

27
00:02:06.04 --> 00:02:11.24
And after we got him cuffed, his family under our control and our target secured, we

28
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:16.76
realized through our interrogation process that he was in fact the number two most wanted

29
00:02:16.76 --> 00:02:23.88
enemy in Western Iraq at the time.

30
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:31.000
So that right there is an excerpt from a book called Never Enough which was written

31
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.56
by Mike Hayes who is a retired seal officer who served 20 years in the teams which included

32
00:02:39.56 --> 00:02:47.60
tours at team 4 team 8 team 10 and also a tour as the commanding officer of seal team

33
00:02:47.60 --> 00:02:48.60
2.

34
00:02:48.60 --> 00:02:54.24
And it is career he deployed to South America, Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan.

35
00:02:54.24 --> 00:03:00.16
He also served in the White House as part of the National Security Council under both

36
00:03:00.16 --> 00:03:04.08
George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

37
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:12.20
I actually did serve with him for a short time in Germany when he was the operations officer

38
00:03:12.20 --> 00:03:19.000
and we are lucky enough to have him here with us tonight to discuss some of his experiences

39
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.04
and lessons learned.

40
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:23.44
Mike, thanks for joining us, man.

41
00:03:23.44 --> 00:03:25.44
Jocco, great to see you, brother.

42
00:03:25.44 --> 00:03:27.08
Great to be here.

43
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:34.04
Yeah, we haven't hung out much since we were playing combat water polo in Germany.

44
00:03:34.04 --> 00:03:41.04
Which was circa 1998 and you were stationed at Unit 2.

45
00:03:41.04 --> 00:03:42.04
Were you the officer?

46
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:46.04
I was the assistant officer but close enough.

47
00:03:46.04 --> 00:03:50.04
Okay, so you were the assistant, oh that's right, seal, exo.

48
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:52.16
You were the assistant officer.

49
00:03:52.16 --> 00:03:54.24
So that you know that made me right as an engine.

50
00:03:54.24 --> 00:03:57.24
I was like the assistant assistant, the officer.

51
00:03:57.24 --> 00:03:59.80
So we would have these games, these water polo games.

52
00:03:59.80 --> 00:04:01.48
Did you actually play water polo?

53
00:04:01.48 --> 00:04:07.68
I didn't play in college but man alive combat water polo with you was one of my best memories.

54
00:04:07.68 --> 00:04:13.48
I obviously sucked at water polo but I was good at jiu-jitsu even then and I used to

55
00:04:13.48 --> 00:04:18.88
more for me it was more just water jiu-jitsu especially against the guys that actually

56
00:04:18.88 --> 00:04:20.40
could play water polo.

57
00:04:20.40 --> 00:04:23.52
The good and there were some guys that played water polo in college.

58
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:25.08
I don't know if you remember that.

59
00:04:25.08 --> 00:04:26.08
Yeah.

60
00:04:26.08 --> 00:04:30.76
There were a couple guys that really needed to get taken out of the game or at least mitigated

61
00:04:30.76 --> 00:04:31.76
as much as possible.

62
00:04:31.76 --> 00:04:35.12
Yeah, I don't have either for people listening the rules.

63
00:04:35.12 --> 00:04:36.64
There's just really one rule.

64
00:04:36.64 --> 00:04:40.16
If you let go of the ball, you're supposed to let go of the person.

65
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:45.44
So it was intense and I always did my best to be on your team.

66
00:04:45.44 --> 00:04:50.84
All right, all right, let's get right into it.

67
00:04:50.84 --> 00:04:55.08
Let's talk about you and let's talk about where you grew up.

68
00:04:55.08 --> 00:04:56.08
Where'd you grew up?

69
00:04:56.08 --> 00:04:57.08
You're in New England, right?

70
00:04:57.08 --> 00:05:00.72
Yeah, well dad was in an AV so bounced around a good bit but from ninth to ninth.

71
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:02.40
Great on, ports with Rhode Island.

72
00:05:02.40 --> 00:05:03.76
What did your dad do in the Navy?

73
00:05:03.76 --> 00:05:08.48
He was a combination of submariner out of college and then supply officer.

74
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:10.64
So kind of a joint career there.

75
00:05:10.64 --> 00:05:11.72
And how long did he do?

76
00:05:11.72 --> 00:05:14.48
He did 20 years, 23 years or something like that.

77
00:05:14.48 --> 00:05:16.08
Answer you were all over the place.

78
00:05:16.08 --> 00:05:19.36
I was until ninth grade.

79
00:05:19.36 --> 00:05:21.08
Where were you up until ninth grade?

80
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:27.30
I lived in mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, Glam, you know, just a couple places around the

81
00:05:27.30 --> 00:05:30.68
US and then just really happy to set up.

82
00:05:30.68 --> 00:05:33.98
I was just a little down in ninth grade onward and call the biggest little state of Rhode

83
00:05:33.98 --> 00:05:35.98
Island home.

84
00:05:35.98 --> 00:05:36.98
How long you and Glam for?

85
00:05:36.98 --> 00:05:37.98
What grade?

86
00:05:37.98 --> 00:05:38.98
Seventh and eighth grade.

87
00:05:38.98 --> 00:05:40.98
Was that pretty bad?

88
00:05:40.98 --> 00:05:41.98
What year was this now?

89
00:05:41.98 --> 00:05:43.68
That was 83 to 85.

90
00:05:43.68 --> 00:05:48.28
So Glam was remote, a 83, 84.

91
00:05:48.28 --> 00:05:52.92
We get the Super Bowl mailed to us like four weeks after it happened.

92
00:05:52.92 --> 00:05:58.50
Because I went to Glam in 1992, 93 when they finally, when they started sending seals

93
00:05:58.50 --> 00:06:05.26
there on deployment and it was, I mean, you were not really connected.

94
00:06:05.26 --> 00:06:06.78
I mean, there's no internet or anything.

95
00:06:06.78 --> 00:06:09.70
So everything took a while to show up there.

96
00:06:09.70 --> 00:06:14.98
It was a very educational part of my growing up.

97
00:06:14.98 --> 00:06:17.26
You know, there's the simplicity.

98
00:06:17.26 --> 00:06:23.06
It was awesome, but at the same time, you definitely give up some of the amenities of modern

99
00:06:23.06 --> 00:06:24.06
life.

100
00:06:24.06 --> 00:06:26.02
Did you go to school out in town or did you go to school on base?

101
00:06:26.02 --> 00:06:30.78
Want to a private Catholic junior high school high school?

102
00:06:30.78 --> 00:06:31.78
Okay.

103
00:06:31.78 --> 00:06:32.78
Seventh and eighth grade.

104
00:06:32.78 --> 00:06:36.82
So you didn't get the crap beat out of you by the loaks?

105
00:06:36.82 --> 00:06:37.82
Oh, no, I did.

106
00:06:37.82 --> 00:06:41.30
Of course I did.

107
00:06:41.30 --> 00:06:46.10
I got a friend that was at S.D.V. in Hawaii, but he grew up in Hawaii.

108
00:06:46.10 --> 00:06:49.78
He was actually at Team 3 as well, but he said it was so, it was rough.

109
00:06:49.78 --> 00:06:52.06
Man, growing up, he was a highly kid in Hawaii.

110
00:06:52.06 --> 00:06:53.78
He said it was rough, man.

111
00:06:53.78 --> 00:06:54.78
Echo Charles commentary.

112
00:06:54.78 --> 00:06:55.78
Yes sir.

113
00:06:55.78 --> 00:06:56.78
Rough.

114
00:06:56.78 --> 00:06:57.78
Rough for the howly kids.

115
00:06:57.78 --> 00:06:58.78
I can't be a defense.

116
00:06:58.78 --> 00:06:59.78
It really depends.

117
00:06:59.78 --> 00:07:04.26
Well, this particular guy who's a great guy.

118
00:07:04.26 --> 00:07:09.58
Where I think he might have been claiming a lot of it had to do with him being howly.

119
00:07:09.58 --> 00:07:14.06
I think it may have also had to do with his mouth, which was rather large.

120
00:07:14.06 --> 00:07:15.86
That is typically the case.

121
00:07:15.86 --> 00:07:16.86
Yeah.

122
00:07:16.86 --> 00:07:19.22
Oh, classic.

123
00:07:19.22 --> 00:07:23.78
So you know, you mentioned that your dad was in the Navy, but you have a section here

124
00:07:23.78 --> 00:07:27.30
about your grandfather as well, and I'm just going to go to the book here and read this

125
00:07:27.30 --> 00:07:29.70
because it's a pretty awesome piece of history.

126
00:07:29.70 --> 00:07:34.50
You say, my grandfather graduated from the Naval Academy in 1940 and was nursing a hangover

127
00:07:34.50 --> 00:07:40.98
in a bungalow on the Pearl Harbor Naval Base, the morning of December 7, 1941, when the

128
00:07:40.98 --> 00:07:43.26
Japanese began bombing.

129
00:07:43.26 --> 00:07:47.78
He was with seven others at the time, and when he heard the first wave of something going

130
00:07:47.78 --> 00:07:53.66
on, he knew he needed to get in his Jeep and go toward the harbor back to his ship.

131
00:07:53.66 --> 00:07:55.38
One of the others would go with him.

132
00:07:55.38 --> 00:07:58.06
They all believed they were safe or where they were.

133
00:07:58.06 --> 00:08:02.74
He told me the scariest part was heading toward the ship, driving past the marine guarding

134
00:08:02.74 --> 00:08:08.18
the gate at 45 miles an hour without stopping, worrying the guard would shoot him.

135
00:08:08.18 --> 00:08:11.78
My grandfather made it to a ship and manned his battle station.

136
00:08:11.78 --> 00:08:15.94
He was on board that ship for the third wave of attacks and tended to many of the wounded

137
00:08:15.94 --> 00:08:17.26
that day.

138
00:08:17.26 --> 00:08:21.62
In the wake of the bombing, he realized that he didn't want to spend his career on the ground

139
00:08:21.62 --> 00:08:23.26
or at sea.

140
00:08:23.26 --> 00:08:24.82
He'd tell me this story.

141
00:08:24.82 --> 00:08:29.42
He would point up with the sky and say he wanted to be up there.

142
00:08:29.42 --> 00:08:34.70
He put in a transfer to become a pilot and after flight school as a World War II rage

143
00:08:34.70 --> 00:08:39.90
to cross the Pacific, he ended up stationed in the illusion islands doing long-range bombing

144
00:08:39.90 --> 00:08:44.94
missions from the outermost islands and helping to attack strategic sites in northern

145
00:08:44.94 --> 00:08:46.18
Japan.

146
00:08:46.18 --> 00:08:53.18
He took over as the commanding officer of his 35 plane bombing squadron at age 26 after

147
00:08:53.18 --> 00:08:58.30
his own commanding officer was shot down and he later served as a test pilot for the Navy's

148
00:08:58.30 --> 00:09:03.14
first helicopters and the commanding officer of the Navy's first helicopters squadron during

149
00:09:03.14 --> 00:09:05.34
the Korean War.

150
00:09:05.34 --> 00:09:09.82
He ended his career as a professor of naval science at Holy Cross and commanding officer

151
00:09:09.82 --> 00:09:13.46
of the school's ROTC training unit.

152
00:09:13.46 --> 00:09:18.94
He taught me about causes greater than self what it means to serve and how to keep pushing

153
00:09:18.94 --> 00:09:22.86
yourself to get better.

154
00:09:22.86 --> 00:09:24.58
No offense, bro.

155
00:09:24.58 --> 00:09:27.94
But if anyone should have written a book, it sounds like it would be the granddad.

156
00:09:27.94 --> 00:09:29.94
I agree.

157
00:09:29.94 --> 00:09:30.94
Larger than life.

158
00:09:30.94 --> 00:09:35.18
He's a real, like absolute hero.

159
00:09:35.18 --> 00:09:39.46
I was blessed to be able to grow up around a person that didn't say what do you want to be

160
00:09:39.46 --> 00:09:40.46
when you grow up.

161
00:09:40.46 --> 00:09:43.10
He would always say who do you want to be.

162
00:09:43.10 --> 00:09:48.90
There are a few of us on the nation and on the planet that know what it's like to set

163
00:09:48.90 --> 00:09:52.86
your personal desire and a suit aside and assume risk for the nation.

164
00:09:52.86 --> 00:09:57.30
I grew up with the stories of my grandfather who did that quite regularly and it was always

165
00:09:57.30 --> 00:10:03.86
inspirational and I'm really thankful it unquestionably made it in a delible mark on who I am.

166
00:10:03.86 --> 00:10:09.58
So he was the commander of the ROTC unit at Holy Cross.

167
00:10:09.58 --> 00:10:14.90
That's awesome to thank you had a guy that did all that.

168
00:10:14.90 --> 00:10:17.62
Did he fight in the Korean War when he was of a helicopter pilot?

169
00:10:17.62 --> 00:10:21.50
So he was actually here at North Island, California.

170
00:10:21.50 --> 00:10:26.82
As HU1 was the unit name and I just remember it because I can still see a lot of his

171
00:10:26.82 --> 00:10:31.22
plaques that he out in his walls which are almost memorized in my brain.

172
00:10:31.22 --> 00:10:36.26
But in Korea what the Navy would do is put a couple helicopters out on some of the frigates

173
00:10:36.26 --> 00:10:40.06
and the ships and then use that to go fly search and rescue.

174
00:10:40.06 --> 00:10:44.90
So he like those of us who in leadership positions in combat, he didn't have to get

175
00:10:44.90 --> 00:10:46.86
into the cockpit and go fly.

176
00:10:46.86 --> 00:10:50.62
Every time he went to visit the troops and there was something that happened, he said

177
00:10:50.62 --> 00:10:55.78
told the young JG to step aside and he was going to fly this one and I'll never forget

178
00:10:55.78 --> 00:11:02.30
one great story that he told from Korea about being shot at quite heavily going into

179
00:11:02.30 --> 00:11:07.14
rescue a pilot and just very calmly looking at his copilot and after this copilot was

180
00:11:07.14 --> 00:11:12.50
freaking out a bit and saying, sir there's shoot net us, shoot net us and of course I'm sure

181
00:11:12.50 --> 00:11:21.46
my grandfather just ice in his veins just sudson, we're at war, that's their paragative.

182
00:11:21.46 --> 00:11:28.02
I was on a go on an operation as my first deployment to Iraq and we're driving in a

183
00:11:28.02 --> 00:11:31.22
convoy and we're heading south of Baghdad and it was a long transit.

184
00:11:31.22 --> 00:11:33.50
We were going down the net job as a matter of fact.

185
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:37.82
So it's a long haul, few hours, maybe like four or five hours.

186
00:11:37.82 --> 00:11:44.06
We get ambushed and a couple RPGs, some small arms firing, the RPGs missed us, one of them

187
00:11:44.06 --> 00:11:47.58
went over and I'm in vehicle two and it was a long convoy.

188
00:11:47.58 --> 00:11:52.70
We had some vehicle, another type of vehicle in the middle so we probably had six vehicles.

189
00:11:52.70 --> 00:11:59.82
So the and you know we're driving blackout and it's at night and we so we get so my vehicle

190
00:11:59.82 --> 00:12:05.82
we make it, nothing happens to us at all and then we see I the first thing I saw was

191
00:12:05.82 --> 00:12:10.54
I was looking kind of outboard and I just see an explosion which the first thing that I saw

192
00:12:10.54 --> 00:12:14.46
I saw a couple of tracers but then I saw an explosion which was an RPG that went high and then

193
00:12:14.46 --> 00:12:19.10
another one went low and we just you know kept driving.

194
00:12:19.10 --> 00:12:26.94
I think I think you know pushed through is the typical call whenever and then by the tune

195
00:12:26.94 --> 00:12:31.74
chief who's a freak a great guy but he was in vehicle six so he's the one that got to like

196
00:12:31.74 --> 00:12:35.66
watch the RPGs near missing all this stuff and he comes up on the radio and he

197
00:12:35.66 --> 00:12:42.30
goes he's like hey sir you we just got ambushed back here we took smart PG and some had some

198
00:12:42.30 --> 00:12:49.98
it's freaking small arms and I came up on the radio and I went Roger and he got a big kick out of

199
00:12:49.98 --> 00:12:57.18
that maybe I should have been more understanding at the time but yeah got to try and stay calm.

200
00:12:57.18 --> 00:12:59.42
Sometimes empathy works and sometimes it doesn't right?

201
00:12:59.42 --> 00:13:07.02
So you're growing up you do your high school years in Rhode Island what sports were you doing?

202
00:13:07.02 --> 00:13:12.94
Did you play sports? Yeah you saw Krabaskyball baseball you know was very you know average at all

203
00:13:12.94 --> 00:13:16.54
three in a town that was or in a state that wasn't exactly competitive either so.

204
00:13:18.62 --> 00:13:21.82
That's that's a harsh statement about poor old road highway.

205
00:13:23.18 --> 00:13:26.30
And so you're just a decent athlete I mean how tall are you?

206
00:13:26.30 --> 00:13:29.98
Six four and you didn't play did you where you go to basketball?

207
00:13:29.98 --> 00:13:34.22
I was you know I was decent but in college all my friends were on the varsity team and I was like man

208
00:13:34.22 --> 00:13:38.30
I can't hold a candle to these guys and what about grades were you studying hard?

209
00:13:38.30 --> 00:13:40.46
I was a good student in high school.

210
00:13:41.50 --> 00:13:46.70
Were you what kind of music were you listening to? Oh gosh wow that's a great question so mid 80s

211
00:13:46.70 --> 00:13:52.54
I was like you know rush a little quiet riot maybe what else would that have been you know

212
00:13:52.54 --> 00:13:56.62
that that that that pretty much dates it you'd quiet riot.

213
00:13:57.74 --> 00:13:59.18
Was that come on field in the ways?

214
00:13:59.18 --> 00:14:02.86
Is that and why and or is that twisted sister?

215
00:14:02.86 --> 00:14:07.66
Man that's not my hair metal bands and then since your

216
00:14:07.66 --> 00:14:14.14
since your grandfather worked at Holy Cross you went to Holy Cross was that pre pre or damed or how

217
00:14:14.14 --> 00:14:18.94
that happened my family has a long history with Holy Cross my great grandfather is in the varsity

218
00:14:18.94 --> 00:14:26.54
Hall of Fame class in 1910 and and so you know my grandfather there's a lot of relatives who

219
00:14:26.54 --> 00:14:31.98
have been there so no one ever pushed the navy or Holy Cross or anything on me it was more of just

220
00:14:31.98 --> 00:14:37.50
a hayson here's what's out there there's this thing called a four year ROTC scholarship and

221
00:14:37.50 --> 00:14:43.02
you know I just love for you to be familiar with it and you know I'll never forget my grandfather

222
00:14:43.02 --> 00:14:47.90
and dad put me in the car like summer of junior year in high school and driving me up to

223
00:14:47.90 --> 00:14:53.26
Holy Cross and and actually meeting the major who is in charge of the unit at the time and

224
00:14:53.26 --> 00:14:58.06
that was a guy who to this day is a great friend of mine Joe Dunford later became the chairman of

225
00:14:58.06 --> 00:15:03.26
the joint chiefs' staff so you know Holy Cross has as a as a story to institution with a lot of

226
00:15:03.26 --> 00:15:10.62
history and I was it was a no-brainer for me. Then you show up there and you're instantly you're

227
00:15:10.62 --> 00:15:14.86
you're you take an ROTC scholarship out of the gate I do you know they're paying for college

228
00:15:14.86 --> 00:15:20.30
everything that's pretty good deal yeah at the time I was just thinking to myself as the oldest of four

229
00:15:20.30 --> 00:15:25.90
this is a great chance to not burn any cash and save money from my younger three siblings to be able

230
00:15:25.90 --> 00:15:30.78
to go to college and you know it's it I thought I'd do four years of some sort of a supply officer

231
00:15:30.78 --> 00:15:35.42
and get out or you know be have great leadership experience for four years and then you recall we

232
00:15:35.42 --> 00:15:40.86
invaded Panama in 89 there was a guy named John Conner's who was killed on the Patea Runway.

233
00:15:40.86 --> 00:15:47.02
John was a Worcester poly tech graduate but Holy Cross ROTC so my first exposure to the seal teams

234
00:15:47.02 --> 00:15:52.54
was the memorial service in the chapel at Holy Cross where the the seal community came together

235
00:15:52.54 --> 00:15:57.42
and remembered John Conner's and that left it real mark on me but freshman year dude I was

236
00:15:58.14 --> 00:16:03.34
six four and I don't know about 105 pounds I'm not an auditor but I was there was no way at that age

237
00:16:03.34 --> 00:16:08.38
I even thought about myself being capable of going through seal training but then later on as the

238
00:16:08.38 --> 00:16:12.62
years progressed and I I went from one pushups to one and a half or something like that you know then

239
00:16:12.62 --> 00:16:19.90
then I I I went to many buds and then became was was that your first sort of knowledge of the

240
00:16:19.90 --> 00:16:25.82
seal teams yeah first was when Panama happened yeah because Panama definitely influenced me as well

241
00:16:25.82 --> 00:16:31.66
because I fought to myself wait there's a war going on as far as I was concerned there's a war going on

242
00:16:31.66 --> 00:16:37.66
and I was thinking to myself how is this happening and I'm not there and how do I get there

243
00:16:37.66 --> 00:16:45.02
ASAP and that's why I do in the Navy well you know for me it was not what went through my head at that time

244
00:16:45.02 --> 00:16:50.22
for me it was more of like a beef come familiar with it and said it aside for a couple years and you know

245
00:16:50.22 --> 00:16:55.18
an ROTC you spend a week in the summer with the pilot it's a week with the you know the submariners

246
00:16:55.18 --> 00:16:59.10
and the surface guys and you try to figure out what do you want to be when you grow up and you know

247
00:16:59.10 --> 00:17:04.78
I had a great aviation crew as I flew in an A6 off of the USS Saratoga and it was right after top

248
00:17:04.78 --> 00:17:08.86
gun came out so there's like 92 issue or something and I was like you know partying like a rock star

249
00:17:08.86 --> 00:17:12.78
and thought I'm gonna go be a pilot this is freaking awesome then I went to three weeks of many

250
00:17:12.78 --> 00:17:18.94
buds and became perversely attracted with that challenge is so holy cross have you ever been

251
00:17:18.94 --> 00:17:25.26
a Notre Dame before I have you know so Notre Dame I've been there a few times and it you know like

252
00:17:25.26 --> 00:17:30.38
the females aren't allowed in the male dorms and you have for the if they are they got to be out of

253
00:17:30.38 --> 00:17:36.30
there by 10 o'clock at night like it's pretty strict from a college aged person perspective it's

254
00:17:36.30 --> 00:17:41.98
holy cross like that as well it's not as strict the there were you know at this point maybe

255
00:17:41.98 --> 00:17:47.50
I'm gonna guess roughly 10 or 15 Jesuit priests on as as professors when I was in college it's

256
00:17:47.50 --> 00:17:53.10
less now but you know there was some that would would go out and enjoy a glass of wine or more

257
00:17:53.10 --> 00:17:58.30
for but they disappear around 10 o'clock at night and but it was it was a it was there's a great

258
00:17:58.30 --> 00:18:04.62
relationship between you know the the student body and the faculty so now you're saying that you did

259
00:18:04.62 --> 00:18:09.66
summer cruises and for those people that don't know this is when you're going to college you're in

260
00:18:09.66 --> 00:18:16.70
ROTC the Navy will take young college kids and send them out to get a little taste of the different

261
00:18:16.70 --> 00:18:21.02
parts of the Navy so did you do a ship one just a straight-up ship or do I did for a day

262
00:18:21.66 --> 00:18:26.70
and I was like this ain't me you know so uh that's all it took on the war that wasn't hard

263
00:18:26.70 --> 00:18:31.98
we did you we did you actually go like on to a ship somewhere that was on deployment or what was that

264
00:18:31.98 --> 00:18:38.54
you know I think what we did was got helicopter from Norfolk over to some frigate for 36 hours or something

265
00:18:38.54 --> 00:18:43.42
it was thank God it wasn't longer and then what and then what year was that after your first year

266
00:18:43.42 --> 00:18:49.18
91-nish 92-ish yeah then when did you do the pilot thing what year was between junior and senior year

267
00:18:49.18 --> 00:18:54.14
okay so in between your junior year senior junior year and your senior year you get the full on

268
00:18:54.14 --> 00:19:01.10
top gun experience I did and then the full on buds and experience after that so that was

269
00:19:01.10 --> 00:19:05.02
in the same summer same summer that was an optional three week thing and I thought you know in order

270
00:19:05.02 --> 00:19:08.70
to really figure out do I want to be a pilot or do I want to be a seal I've got to go do this many

271
00:19:08.70 --> 00:19:14.78
buds thing and they took 32 kids out of college for that program what year was the mini buds

272
00:19:14.78 --> 00:19:21.98
it was the summer of 92 so you show up to mini buds and what are they doing this is three weeks long

273
00:19:21.98 --> 00:19:26.78
it was a legit they they legit three week one week of each other three phases of training and

274
00:19:26.78 --> 00:19:29.26
you know when you're going through it you're like how does this compare with the real thing

275
00:19:30.46 --> 00:19:36.54
it was after going through the real thing I look back and say we got a legit full treatment for each of

276
00:19:36.54 --> 00:19:41.50
the three weeks and I think nowadays they use that sort of it's called something else now I think

277
00:19:41.50 --> 00:19:47.26
it's called seal officer assessment and selection and it's it's something like mini buds but

278
00:19:47.26 --> 00:19:51.82
it's sort of the selection and how they're going to figure out who gets to go was it like that

279
00:19:51.82 --> 00:19:58.70
for for you guys I they definitely was we came out with like grades out of the 32 you know like

280
00:19:58.70 --> 00:20:03.90
not grades as an academic but like just an all around score of how you did and and you know

281
00:20:03.90 --> 00:20:08.38
I remember having a pretty high number and thought I think I'll be probably this will stand

282
00:20:08.38 --> 00:20:13.90
me pretty well if I applied to to circle back and go to buds and history has it I did and they took

283
00:20:13.90 --> 00:20:19.18
16 guys out of ROTC my year 16 guys out of the academy so there are 32 officers taken into the

284
00:20:19.18 --> 00:20:23.34
program and as you know I don't know the number maybe 15 of those made it through ultimately or

285
00:20:23.34 --> 00:20:30.38
something like that there's only quid quitters and mini buds oh yeah there was fun it's just like

286
00:20:30.38 --> 00:20:36.94
okay don't let the door hit you the asshole the way out you know and so this is now 1993 that you

287
00:20:36.94 --> 00:20:44.30
graduate from Holy Cross and you get your you get selected I mean the selection process for officers

288
00:20:44.30 --> 00:20:50.86
now is totally insane I mean it's insane back then but with all the hype around seals and all that

289
00:20:50.86 --> 00:20:58.62
it's just ridiculous but still taken 16 from ROTC and 16 from the Naval Academy that's slim pickins

290
00:20:59.66 --> 00:21:04.54
it was tough and the hard thing as a rising senior in needing to make a life decision was that

291
00:21:04.54 --> 00:21:09.58
I knew that if I applied for buds I would not get my number two choice of pilot because

292
00:21:09.58 --> 00:21:15.82
once you work through and they take the washouts who they don't pick for seal training all the pilot slots

293
00:21:15.82 --> 00:21:20.94
are gone so it was a little bit of a gamble a lot of a gamble but like anything in life go for what you want

294
00:21:21.58 --> 00:21:27.26
and then you would have been on that ship that you didn't write very much and then you show up

295
00:21:27.26 --> 00:21:34.70
to what what buds cost for you 192 so you show up for buds class 192 how prepared were you you think

296
00:21:34.70 --> 00:21:40.14
I was very prepared I wasn't far from the most gifted physical athlete you know I

297
00:21:40.14 --> 00:21:44.54
I mean friends that did you know showed up and did 50 pull ups and I you know struggle with my you know

298
00:21:44.54 --> 00:21:50.70
eight and a quarter you know it was like that but you know 64 230 at a time I like all I ran real fast

299
00:21:50.70 --> 00:21:55.58
because it's one like a fish the O course was no trouble for me pull ups where my my downfall but you know

300
00:21:55.58 --> 00:22:02.22
I came in feeling pretty strong was there any was there anything that really challenged you

301
00:22:02.22 --> 00:22:09.18
for me it really was the pull ups it but never to the point where I wasn't a joke around about

302
00:22:09.18 --> 00:22:14.30
the eight and a quarter but I just you know I just I was there for reason you know if

303
00:22:14.30 --> 00:22:19.90
if something's worth doing it's worth overdoing and I prepared as well as I could and I just took

304
00:22:19.90 --> 00:22:24.46
it really seriously when I went through and kind of limited my my drinking when I was going through

305
00:22:24.46 --> 00:22:29.34
buds at age 21 everybody's drinking like a fish I was pretty serious about recovery and and

306
00:22:29.34 --> 00:22:35.34
just knew I needed every advantage I could possibly help myself with when I went through

307
00:22:35.34 --> 00:22:40.54
about that and leave the barracks really yeah like I was a total nerd I would sharpen my knife

308
00:22:40.54 --> 00:22:46.46
and polish my boots like all weekend long and I didn't even think about the recovery aspect I think

309
00:22:46.46 --> 00:22:51.50
that's a new thing like the idea of recovery I don't know I didn't really have that I didn't really

310
00:22:51.50 --> 00:22:55.18
think of that you didn't have guys walking around with those big jug the gallon jugs of water

311
00:22:55.18 --> 00:23:00.22
like that that that was the thing in our our time just pump the fluids after the after the

312
00:23:00.22 --> 00:23:04.94
day and for the weekend yeah I didn't really have too much of that now I've always thought that if you

313
00:23:04.94 --> 00:23:10.14
were if you couldn't do pull ups you're gonna have a problem with the O course and it seems like

314
00:23:10.14 --> 00:23:15.26
you had problems with Paul so you still didn't have a problem with the O course too and I'm I honestly

315
00:23:15.26 --> 00:23:20.38
I flew through though I was always top five in the of course and you socked it pull ups that's

316
00:23:20.38 --> 00:23:26.22
really bizarre I mean it's just a different type of strength pulling just a little bit

317
00:23:26.22 --> 00:23:30.70
laterally sometimes you know it's just that dead overhead up and down for pull ups is a little

318
00:23:30.70 --> 00:23:34.70
different than like rope climb where you're at that a little bit of an angle how were you good at

319
00:23:34.70 --> 00:23:40.22
rope climbs too yeah yeah it's really good that's we must just have some weird genetic anomaly where

320
00:23:40.22 --> 00:23:45.90
pull ups are hard because that's crazy right to be able to do their O course in a top five position

321
00:23:45.90 --> 00:23:51.50
and be socket pull ups that seems crazy yeah I mean I can't explain it I could just tell you what

322
00:23:51.50 --> 00:23:57.18
I experienced yeah well the cool thing about sucking at pull ups is you probably won't fail

323
00:23:57.18 --> 00:24:01.10
buds because you socket pull ups right you can fail you can get drop from buds for running you

324
00:24:01.10 --> 00:24:05.82
can drop get drop from buds from swimming you can get drop from buds for the O course but for

325
00:24:05.82 --> 00:24:12.94
pull ups you might get you know T is basically by the instructors during a PT but yeah no it's

326
00:24:12.94 --> 00:24:20.86
you're not going to get dropped yeah no it's it's very true it's very true how many how many people

327
00:24:20.86 --> 00:24:25.66
quit how many did you start with how many people quit we started with 120 and 19 graduated

328
00:24:27.50 --> 00:24:34.86
started with 120 and 19 graduated what were you did anybody quit that you were like dang what

329
00:24:34.86 --> 00:24:40.62
how's that oh hell yeah you know you you got guys that look like you walking on on day one

330
00:24:40.62 --> 00:24:47.58
and you're like man what am I doing here but you know guys just drop like flies and you know my

331
00:24:48.22 --> 00:24:51.58
you remember in the beginning they they assigned swim buddies you just throw people in the pool and

332
00:24:51.58 --> 00:24:57.02
go swim you know a mile or half mile I can't remember what you was but it was just swim as fast as

333
00:24:57.02 --> 00:25:01.74
you can and with 120 guys in the pool you're crawling all over each other and just doing and then they

334
00:25:01.74 --> 00:25:05.34
just pair up you know number one and number two or swim pair one number three and number four or

335
00:25:05.34 --> 00:25:10.54
swim pair two and so on so myself and Chris Cassidy were swim pair one and so Chris and I like

336
00:25:10.54 --> 00:25:16.06
life long friends from you know day one of Buds and and the two of us just we're always had this

337
00:25:16.86 --> 00:25:23.34
fun healthy sense of talking trash at each other and you know he ended up as the honor man for the

338
00:25:23.34 --> 00:25:28.06
class and I I years later went back to Buds and I told him that I pulled all the records and

339
00:25:28.06 --> 00:25:32.30
recalculated the math and at this point he was an astronaut of course you know and and I said hey I

340
00:25:32.30 --> 00:25:35.90
just got some bad news for you I'm having your name taken off the plaque and my name's going up

341
00:25:38.94 --> 00:25:43.90
so so but nothing really challenged you made it through one shot one shot I know honestly no major injuries

342
00:25:43.90 --> 00:25:48.86
or anything like that it was like that or nothing so I really can honestly say I never thought about

343
00:25:48.86 --> 00:25:52.94
quitting and I never it was hard just like the rest of us but just power straight through yeah

344
00:25:54.14 --> 00:26:00.22
so then you get assigned to so it's now 1994 and 94 and you get to assign to team four

345
00:26:00.22 --> 00:26:06.94
did you speak did you speak Spanish prior to that I was almost a double major in Spanish so good

346
00:26:06.94 --> 00:26:12.54
good in the books but never real at that point in life not a lot of practical Spanish because that was

347
00:26:13.26 --> 00:26:17.42
when we were coming up if you spoke Spanish you were going to team four pretty much guaranteed

348
00:26:19.90 --> 00:26:24.94
so being a new guy at the team and I have a good new guy story from your book here

349
00:26:24.94 --> 00:26:30.38
and we'll go to the book it says another story again from my time as a brand new seal

350
00:26:30.94 --> 00:26:36.86
the Navy needed four of us to test out some new equipment I was volunteers to take part in the

351
00:26:36.86 --> 00:26:42.94
exercise they took us in a boat two or three miles offshore dropped us in the water and told us to

352
00:26:42.94 --> 00:26:47.66
swim to the beach stay for a few minutes and then swim back to the boat together it turned out

353
00:26:47.66 --> 00:26:53.74
that conditions were unexpectedly harsh 40 knot winds nearly eight foot high waves and the four of us

354
00:26:53.74 --> 00:27:00.14
immediately lost each other unable to see more than a few feet in front of us man that's scary

355
00:27:00.14 --> 00:27:06.14
in its own right I swam for what felt like hours before I finally got to the beach and once I was there

356
00:27:06.14 --> 00:27:11.66
I could not see my teammates I waited and waited but there was simply no sign of them

357
00:27:12.30 --> 00:27:16.54
I figured maybe I'd miss them maybe I'd gotten slowed down by the waves maybe they'd already

358
00:27:16.54 --> 00:27:21.02
made their way back so I got back in the water and tried to return to the boat even though I couldn't

359
00:27:21.02 --> 00:27:27.34
see it in my mind I had to complete the assigned mission at all costs just keep going this is what a

360
00:27:27.34 --> 00:27:33.02
seal has to do I couldn't find my way back to the boat because the harsh conditions I was using

361
00:27:33.02 --> 00:27:38.86
myself a range of compass to do my best to swim a straight line of bearing to the planned link up point

362
00:27:39.74 --> 00:27:45.58
but it didn't work I realized I must have drifted much more than I expected I couldn't see

363
00:27:45.58 --> 00:27:51.18
back to the beach either for a few hours I was basically lost at sea worrying the other three more

364
00:27:51.18 --> 00:27:57.98
experience seals would think I was a total screw up I'd broken a fin strap and at one point I was

365
00:27:57.98 --> 00:28:05.26
startled okay scared when I was moved about 10 feet in the water bumped hard by a massive sea mammal

366
00:28:05.26 --> 00:28:09.98
I imagine that no one would ever find my body and everyone in the seals would think I must not

367
00:28:09.98 --> 00:28:14.78
a bit been a good swimmer despite entering buds training with one of the fastest swim times in the

368
00:28:14.78 --> 00:28:20.46
history the program and along with my swim buddy Chris Cassidy coming seconds away from the fastest

369
00:28:20.46 --> 00:28:26.94
ever two mile swim in buds finally the boat found me and picked me up and I was quickly

370
00:28:27.66 --> 00:28:35.50
exerated for being stupid enough to make the swim back out to sea my three teammates had ended

371
00:28:35.50 --> 00:28:41.10
up down the beach from where the current had taken me just a bit too far away from me to see them

372
00:28:41.10 --> 00:28:45.58
and they stayed on the beach until the boat came for them knowing conditions were too miserable

373
00:28:45.58 --> 00:28:51.42
to even attempt to head back I'd put myself at risk for a training exercise because I can

374
00:28:51.42 --> 00:28:56.62
fuse doing the hard thing with doing the right thing my decision was far too risky to make

375
00:28:56.62 --> 00:29:02.30
sense even as a confident and capable swimmer there's so many little lessons in that one right

376
00:29:02.30 --> 00:29:06.22
there that little story and by the way so your book is filled with a bunch of lessons and obviously I'm

377
00:29:06.22 --> 00:29:12.94
just reading excerpts from it and this chapter was choosing the hard path and doing the hard thing

378
00:29:13.66 --> 00:29:20.38
and of course everything's a dichotomy and you can do things where you go too hard but I can't

379
00:29:20.38 --> 00:29:24.54
even imagine you with your silver ranger which is for those of you that don't know it's a little

380
00:29:24.54 --> 00:29:29.18
compass that used to navigate on the land and you they you probably had it with you for like E&D or

381
00:29:29.18 --> 00:29:35.18
some whatever and you actually pulled this thing out you're trying to swim a bearing which is literally

382
00:29:35.18 --> 00:29:41.42
impossible to do my distance totally ridiculous and what I what I love about this is this is so true

383
00:29:42.38 --> 00:29:46.54
the main thing you're worried about you're lost at sea for hours you're getting pushed around

384
00:29:46.54 --> 00:29:52.06
by sea animals the main thing you're worried about is looking like a loser for you to keep it

385
00:29:52.06 --> 00:29:58.62
if you bad team guy that's exactly right you know I still vividly remember being you know

386
00:29:58.62 --> 00:30:02.46
pushed this you know eight or ten feet or so in the water and just thinking okay this is going to

387
00:30:02.46 --> 00:30:07.26
be the end but the worst thing is people are just gonna think I was a terrible swimmer and it's just

388
00:30:07.26 --> 00:30:12.54
not what you want stop and look you want I'm like no I'm a good swimmer please don't think that you know

389
00:30:12.54 --> 00:30:15.90
so yeah there's a million lessons in there you know it's you know this well when you when you're

390
00:30:15.90 --> 00:30:20.86
right a book if you if you if you're the president of your own fan club by definition you don't have

391
00:30:20.86 --> 00:30:27.02
a book you know and and so sharing these things where we you know that didn't make good decisions or

392
00:30:27.02 --> 00:30:31.58
or in retrospect we're we're actually stupid I think that's where the learning is and that's what I try

393
00:30:31.58 --> 00:30:38.78
to do in the book you you as a new guy meaning this is the universal you me you all of us as new

394
00:30:38.78 --> 00:30:47.26
guys pet you do some dumb dumb things and this is a classic example of like this is all the other

395
00:30:47.26 --> 00:30:50.94
guys that were experienced like hey we're not swimming back out are you kidding me well all

396
00:30:50.94 --> 00:30:56.54
die and you of course hey that's what the mission is we're gonna go and do it well a little bit

397
00:30:56.54 --> 00:31:00.06
too it's an interesting thing I'd be interested in your perspective on this but you know

398
00:31:00.06 --> 00:31:07.02
growing up in the teams before 9-11 it was mission mission mission at all costs post 9-11 our

399
00:31:07.02 --> 00:31:12.30
community got much better at saying you know what there's new information let's incorporate new

400
00:31:12.30 --> 00:31:17.42
information what's going on let's think about risk is the risk worth the reward and constantly

401
00:31:17.42 --> 00:31:23.74
reassessing that risk you know it's it's uh it became okay to turn around on a mission in our

402
00:31:23.74 --> 00:31:27.98
raccara Afghanistan and say hey you know what the risk profile just change massively we'll come back

403
00:31:27.98 --> 00:31:31.98
another right for these this group of terrorists there's this risk is not worth assuming and let's

404
00:31:31.98 --> 00:31:35.98
not do the mission and and when I was growing up and when you were growing up we'd be

405
00:31:35.98 --> 00:31:42.30
excoriated for not doing the mission yeah later on we were held up as smart yeah um well there's

406
00:31:42.30 --> 00:31:47.98
there's a big difference you know when we were coming up before the war started we were literally

407
00:31:47.98 --> 00:31:53.90
training for the big mission singular like hey you're gonna do this one mission we didn't know what it

408
00:31:53.90 --> 00:31:58.78
was but that's what we were training for and yeah there was no way it didn't even seem like a

409
00:31:58.78 --> 00:32:05.18
feasible idea that you would turn around on a mission or not complete the mission and then yeah obviously

410
00:32:05.18 --> 00:32:10.14
as the war kicked off and once we started to get combat experience for our generation it was like oh

411
00:32:10.14 --> 00:32:14.38
this doesn't make any sense oh the risk is too high oh the enemy has what we're not going to

412
00:32:14.38 --> 00:32:20.78
get them then and yeah uh that's something that we had to learn just as our forefathers had to

413
00:32:20.78 --> 00:32:26.14
learn and it's unfortunately one of those lessons that it it's almost like we well we had to

414
00:32:26.14 --> 00:32:30.38
relearn it you know uh I wrote about this in leadership strategy in tactics we used to set up

415
00:32:30.38 --> 00:32:37.18
this training scenario in in Mount or South where everyone would call it the urban training where

416
00:32:37.18 --> 00:32:41.50
the guys would be clearing like down a building down a hallway and there'd be we'd have a

417
00:32:41.50 --> 00:32:45.74
barricaded shooter at the end of the hallway and everybody that ended the hallway would get riddled

418
00:32:45.74 --> 00:32:53.02
with paintball and get put down and you'd see unfortunately just about every leader would fall victim

419
00:32:53.02 --> 00:32:57.26
this two more guys go they get mode down two more guys go they get mode down two more guys go they

420
00:32:57.26 --> 00:33:02.46
get mode down and and then you know finally after you know three quarters of the tasking is laying

421
00:33:02.46 --> 00:33:06.78
dead in the hallway we'd say hey man take a step back and think about what's happening what are you

422
00:33:06.78 --> 00:33:11.02
doing it does this make any sense and they would have that's what they have to do is they'd have to

423
00:33:11.02 --> 00:33:16.94
learn to detach and take a step back and go oh this is obviously bad and I shouldn't continue to do

424
00:33:16.94 --> 00:33:23.42
this so yeah that's definitely a lesson that we learned and that we had then to pass on to the

425
00:33:23.42 --> 00:33:31.50
next generation of seals to to make sure they understand that quitting is an option and you know

426
00:33:31.50 --> 00:33:35.90
you don't quit from a strategic perspective but with whatever tactic I'm using right now is

427
00:33:35.90 --> 00:33:39.66
going to cost us lives or get people killed or doesn't make any sense I got no problem saying

428
00:33:39.66 --> 00:33:44.70
up I was wrong this is bad move we're not doing it anymore totally agree and it's a lot of

429
00:33:44.70 --> 00:33:49.02
people ask me how does your business career now that have been retired for ten years and help

430
00:33:49.82 --> 00:33:58.06
run the operations for VMware really large software company the applicability is the exact same

431
00:33:58.54 --> 00:34:03.50
it's hey we have a certain amount of you know capital to invest do we invest it in in place

432
00:34:03.50 --> 00:34:08.22
a or place b or c and and and wait a minute you know what we're getting feedback from the market that

433
00:34:08.22 --> 00:34:12.14
that our original choice wasn't quite right are you going to keep trying to invest your way through

434
00:34:12.14 --> 00:34:16.78
and throw bad money after a good money after bad a bad path no you're going to make a decision

435
00:34:16.78 --> 00:34:21.98
some costs or some let's go try something different and and quickly dynamically assess and so

436
00:34:21.98 --> 00:34:27.66
the parallels between business and the seals are and the military writ larger are really really

437
00:34:27.66 --> 00:34:33.18
perfect yeah I often end up talking to companies and that's the exact example all uses

438
00:34:33.18 --> 00:34:39.42
hey we tried this marketing campaign it's not we're not getting the ROI we expected let's put

439
00:34:39.42 --> 00:34:43.98
more money into it okay and they still don't get the ROI we're expected okay let's put even more

440
00:34:43.98 --> 00:34:49.10
money it's the same thing as sending guys down the hallway to get shot up awesome so

441
00:34:50.38 --> 00:34:56.70
you so you get to team four that's kind of an example of team four what else was going on a team

442
00:34:56.70 --> 00:35:02.14
four when you got there do you get you get put right into a pollton I was relatively quick and maybe

443
00:35:02.14 --> 00:35:07.18
six months or so of kind of like schools and individual time but yeah did you go to so you

444
00:35:07.18 --> 00:35:13.74
went through STT at the team or was it at the team okay so your team is running STT was at a good

445
00:35:13.74 --> 00:35:18.62
course of instruction it was it was good you don't know what you don't know if that age and that

446
00:35:18.62 --> 00:35:24.70
that time in life you know but everything was learning at that point learning what to do sometimes

447
00:35:24.70 --> 00:35:31.26
learning what not to do you know we we but a immediate exposure to what was going on I remember

448
00:35:31.26 --> 00:35:38.30
in demolition training being at four AP Hill one range over from us there were four Marines that

449
00:35:38.30 --> 00:35:44.54
were in a demolition accident and basically vaporized and it was terrible and so what was the

450
00:35:44.54 --> 00:35:49.98
accident there was something called a Meekleek charge it was like a line charge and these it

451
00:35:49.98 --> 00:35:53.90
went low order and they you know collected all the C4 and put it in a pile and then went to

452
00:35:53.90 --> 00:35:59.58
burn it but forgot that there was this little thing called a booster in the C4 and so when they

453
00:35:59.58 --> 00:36:04.78
went because you can burn C4 as everybody as as you know but not everybody necessarily does and

454
00:36:04.78 --> 00:36:10.46
in that cause it to go high order and so you know right away we're exposed to you know real

455
00:36:10.46 --> 00:36:16.38
situations and so lots of like like you know a lot of the the biggest learning comes from the

456
00:36:16.38 --> 00:36:23.34
hardest situations what uh what schools did you go to as a new guy officer well you know it's funny

457
00:36:23.34 --> 00:36:27.82
one of my greatest friends in life war in Nicarcin was the operations chief and as a brand new

458
00:36:27.82 --> 00:36:30.94
incident I remember walking in and saying all right chief Nick the only question I have is do I

459
00:36:30.94 --> 00:36:35.26
go to free fall and then sniper or sniper then free fall and he's like shut up new guy you got

460
00:36:35.26 --> 00:36:40.78
some dog and ponies for you so you know so I was you know hitting the road doing you know dog and

461
00:36:40.78 --> 00:36:45.82
pony shows and all kinds of stuff but you know I went to you know the time it wasn't like you could

462
00:36:45.82 --> 00:36:49.50
get right into free fall school so it took me three or four years to be able to get there and so I

463
00:36:49.50 --> 00:36:53.74
I don't even my schools were so unremarkable at that time that I don't even remember what they were

464
00:36:53.74 --> 00:36:57.66
yeah I know it's a new guy I got sent to like well I was a very lucky that I got sent to the

465
00:36:57.66 --> 00:37:03.10
calm school on the east coast which was awesome but other than that it was like demo driver school

466
00:37:03.10 --> 00:37:08.94
just a few years after you chain up the trailer to the vehicle just complete new guys schools

467
00:37:08.94 --> 00:37:13.74
yeah yeah and then you get full new petune assistant to a commander yep assistant platoon commander

468
00:37:14.38 --> 00:37:20.86
and uh how's your work up you you do you do in a six month to uh what you do you know you're doing

469
00:37:20.86 --> 00:37:25.74
a six month appointment at this time team for deploys to South America yeah it was it deployment was

470
00:37:25.74 --> 00:37:30.86
two Panama and then from there just a lot of what J.S. joint combined exchanges for training where we

471
00:37:30.86 --> 00:37:36.94
we bounced around and you know we trained you know a Salvador you know Chilee Peru just the local

472
00:37:37.90 --> 00:37:45.74
operational forces that were similar to ours and um and it was just a big you know a big bunch of fun

473
00:37:45.74 --> 00:37:51.58
it's just it there just wasn't wasn't there were no real real stuff going on but uh lots of learning

474
00:37:51.58 --> 00:37:56.06
how was how was your you know what what what what would you feel like as a as a new guy officer if

475
00:37:56.06 --> 00:38:00.86
you were talking to yourself when you were younger you're talking to a young uh uh and senator lieutenant

476
00:38:00.86 --> 00:38:05.34
J.G. that's wrong into a platoon right now what what would your what would your advice be?

477
00:38:06.06 --> 00:38:11.66
look I think one of the things that that young officers always wrestle with is how to walk the line

478
00:38:11.66 --> 00:38:17.26
between being a leader when a leader is needed to step forward but at the same time really have the

479
00:38:17.26 --> 00:38:21.50
humility that a lot of other people know a lot of things that you don't know and to me that's what

480
00:38:21.50 --> 00:38:27.74
makes the team special is is when you think about how you make decisions and who makes decisions

481
00:38:27.74 --> 00:38:33.66
we just grow up with that just built into who we are and and and and that's really uh you know

482
00:38:33.66 --> 00:38:39.10
the the the thing you test is when do I step forward and say all right guys shut up lock it on we're

483
00:38:39.10 --> 00:38:44.54
going this direction and when do you kind of step back like like like you you a spouse in a lot of

484
00:38:44.54 --> 00:38:53.18
your work is leading from the rear is okay yeah no one ever expects the the seal leader to say

485
00:38:53.18 --> 00:38:56.70
hey lead from the rear right yeah are there times you got to lead from the front yes absolutely

486
00:38:56.70 --> 00:38:59.90
if you're doing something that dangerous or something that's horrible or something that's even

487
00:38:59.90 --> 00:39:06.22
monotonous sometimes you got to step up and say all right I got this but yeah well if I if I

488
00:39:06.22 --> 00:39:11.98
have the opportunity and someone on my platoon or my team wants to step up and lead no problem go for it

489
00:39:11.98 --> 00:39:18.14
I like to say I like to try and lead with minimum force required right well you know we I think

490
00:39:18.14 --> 00:39:21.90
there are a couple great points here first of all I always say the L and seal stands for lazy all right

491
00:39:21.90 --> 00:39:27.82
and and like we we find the easiest path to go achieve the goal because that gives you more time effort

492
00:39:27.82 --> 00:39:32.54
and energy for the next problem or let's you rest and recover for the next problem but you know

493
00:39:32.54 --> 00:39:38.06
it's like in business we're always thinking about succession planning and the only way you're

494
00:39:38.06 --> 00:39:42.30
going to get your second line ready to be the first line is if the first line can take a step back

495
00:39:42.30 --> 00:39:45.58
and let the second line be the first line so the only thing you need to do if you're in the

496
00:39:45.58 --> 00:39:49.34
leadership position and what I what I try to do now I think it's one thing I do decently

497
00:39:49.34 --> 00:39:53.98
is to step back and let other people make the decisions and only weigh in if and when needed

498
00:39:54.86 --> 00:39:59.50
most importantly it's the process does the process to make decisions make sense is it thinking about

499
00:39:59.50 --> 00:40:03.74
like the seals are a meritocracy as you know is who cares where the idea comes from you get all the

500
00:40:03.74 --> 00:40:07.98
ideas on the table you find the best idea and the best idea wins and that's the way you're going to

501
00:40:07.98 --> 00:40:13.26
go do the mission and that's exactly the way we we need to operate and often do operate in business

502
00:40:13.26 --> 00:40:17.98
yeah and and of course this doesn't mean you let the second string you know run off the cliff

503
00:40:17.98 --> 00:40:22.30
but you can let them bump into the guardrails and get a little dinged up and they're going to learn

504
00:40:22.30 --> 00:40:27.74
from that put some bondo on there and they'll be all right but a lot of times people are paranoid they

505
00:40:27.74 --> 00:40:31.90
don't want to take any risk at all and think that oh you you're gonna make a mistake it's like hey

506
00:40:31.90 --> 00:40:34.78
yeah they're gonna make mistakes and that's how they're gonna learn it comes down to comfort in

507
00:40:34.78 --> 00:40:40.54
your role right I mean it's it's if if I describe careers in three phases the first phase is getting

508
00:40:40.54 --> 00:40:45.66
really good at something whatever it is doctor lawyer seal whatever the second phase is trying to

509
00:40:45.66 --> 00:40:49.66
show the world you're really damn good at what you've chosen and that third phase which many people

510
00:40:49.66 --> 00:40:55.50
don't get to is being so confident that you are good that you no longer need to prove it to anybody

511
00:40:55.50 --> 00:41:00.70
and that's what lets you step back I think when I see in the business world the people the

512
00:41:00.70 --> 00:41:07.82
leaders who don't step back what I see is oftentimes a lack of a lack of confidence that

513
00:41:08.30 --> 00:41:13.66
that that makes the person feel like if they're not in front of the room making the decision

514
00:41:14.22 --> 00:41:19.34
then then they're not seen as the one in charge and so it's really I think a failure of leadership

515
00:41:19.34 --> 00:41:26.70
when you can't step back yeah I had one of the things I used to teach the jails was you have nothing

516
00:41:26.70 --> 00:41:32.86
to prove but everything to prove and the nothing to prove part is hey I don't care how we build this

517
00:41:32.86 --> 00:41:39.82
palette I don't care you know I don't care who goes on this operation I don't care what route we take

518
00:41:39.82 --> 00:41:44.62
in like there's a bunch of little decisions that are gonna get made that if your poll tune makes them

519
00:41:44.62 --> 00:41:49.10
it's perfectly fine and you don't need to prove well my way of getting to the target would be

520
00:41:49.10 --> 00:41:53.42
a little bit more efficient than yours or my way of building with my gutter feet wet yeah just like

521
00:41:53.42 --> 00:41:59.50
all these little things where sometimes that insecure junior leader feels like they need to prove

522
00:41:59.50 --> 00:42:03.74
to everyone that they're in charge and you don't you have nothing to prove you're actually

523
00:42:03.74 --> 00:42:08.38
in charge you're defacting in charge and that's fine you don't need to prove it what you do

524
00:42:08.38 --> 00:42:11.98
need to prove is that you're gonna listen that you're gonna pay attention that you're gonna

525
00:42:11.98 --> 00:42:16.54
make the right decisions at the right time that when it is time to weigh in you're gonna do

526
00:42:16.54 --> 00:42:23.90
something smart not something rash so yeah all good things to think about uh speaking of

527
00:42:25.02 --> 00:42:32.38
not being rash here's a little scenario you talk about in the book my platoon was once training

528
00:42:32.38 --> 00:42:37.18
at the al-tahama I'm gonna say that al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama

529
00:42:37.18 --> 00:42:43.66
river in Georgia and we had an enthusiastic seal named Max we were carrying kayaks with a good

530
00:42:43.66 --> 00:42:47.98
amount of gear inside trying to find the most convenient way to transport guns, paddles and

531
00:42:47.98 --> 00:42:53.18
sensitive reconnaissance equipment that had to stay dry as we waited through the shallow water

532
00:42:53.18 --> 00:42:58.38
suddenly Max very calmly stopped and said to me Mr. Hayes there's a gator on my leg

533
00:43:00.30 --> 00:43:05.66
his calmed and demeanor in the face of such on the alarming statement caused me to doubt him

534
00:43:05.66 --> 00:43:11.10
until he lifted his leg out of the water and I saw three to four foot baby alligator had indeed

535
00:43:11.10 --> 00:43:17.10
added indeed latched around his knee Max to his extreme credit did not overreact he stayed calm

536
00:43:17.10 --> 00:43:21.82
certainly calmer than I would have been and took deep breaths until the alligator decided to open

537
00:43:21.82 --> 00:43:28.30
his mouth and let go Max was unharmed other than for bite mark two scars many of our enemies

538
00:43:28.86 --> 00:43:34.38
are not as cooperative as that baby alligator ended up being which is why our reactions to situations

539
00:43:34.38 --> 00:43:40.14
are so important the smartest seal isn't the one with the greatest wrong intelligence it's the one who has

540
00:43:40.14 --> 00:43:47.02
the best and quickest reaction to the problem the seal who can quickly assess and decide the best

541
00:43:47.02 --> 00:43:52.38
course of action is the one I want on my team not the seal who gets emotional and let's his

542
00:43:52.38 --> 00:43:59.50
feelings or his fears get in the way of pure rationality I said in chapter one that I would take

543
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:06.06
someone with hunger over someone with greater ability every time I'd also take someone who reacts

544
00:44:06.06 --> 00:44:13.50
well over someone with greater raw intelligence you want both intelligence and control but in the

545
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:19.18
stressful moments control matters a lot I would love to find people who are smart enough to predict

546
00:44:19.18 --> 00:44:25.98
the future but I haven't come across many of them so I need people who react well no matter what

547
00:44:25.98 --> 00:44:32.94
the future turns out to hold no matter the context the importance of having good controlled reactions

548
00:44:32.94 --> 00:44:42.86
to surprising situations can never be overstated so there you go freaking gator chops on your leg

549
00:44:43.98 --> 00:44:47.26
yeah you know you know the saying you don't have to out swim your buddy you just have to

550
00:44:47.26 --> 00:44:51.42
obviously you don't have to out swim the shark you just have to out swim your buddy so you know

551
00:44:51.42 --> 00:44:56.70
it's like should I go on a dry land and get away from this guy I remember that situation very

552
00:44:56.70 --> 00:45:02.14
well but in all sincerity it is the expression calm breeds calm excitement breeds excitement

553
00:45:02.14 --> 00:45:07.66
you've been shot at and rocketed enough to know that anytime you're not calm you are just

554
00:45:07.66 --> 00:45:15.66
using a motion that could be used to solve the problem yeah do you think that the that buds

555
00:45:15.66 --> 00:45:22.22
weeds out some of that it's a good question I think to some degree but not perfectly

556
00:45:22.22 --> 00:45:25.26
yeah it's definitely not perfect because I know you and I both have seen plenty of

557
00:45:25.26 --> 00:45:31.74
good like this guy max is a great example of like the calm cool collected seal that you want

558
00:45:31.74 --> 00:45:36.38
in your platoon either in charge of your platoon or wanting your machine gun or your platoon

559
00:45:36.38 --> 00:45:41.34
having a guy like that is awesome having somebody that's just loses their mind is

560
00:45:41.34 --> 00:45:45.98
absolutely horrible I think that's one of those traits that you can learn no I'm sure you're

561
00:45:45.98 --> 00:45:50.86
asked a similar question that I am frequently which is talked to me about what's innate

562
00:45:50.86 --> 00:45:55.50
leadership what are you born with and what can you train through time no I think that calm is a

563
00:45:55.50 --> 00:46:01.42
thing that you can learn and train through time do you agree a hundred percent and you know I

564
00:46:01.42 --> 00:46:05.58
got really lucky in that the last tour that I did was run and trade it out on the west coast and so

565
00:46:05.58 --> 00:46:11.34
I got to run this freaking leadership laboratory which was I honestly think it might have been

566
00:46:12.46 --> 00:46:17.82
the greatest leadership laboratory that's ever existed in the world I thought I think uh

567
00:46:17.82 --> 00:46:24.38
just to be able to put these guys in these stressful situations with so much on the line and

568
00:46:24.38 --> 00:46:28.54
look it wasn't life or death no so I guess combat isn't even better leadership laboratory except

569
00:46:28.54 --> 00:46:34.06
for and combat you can't take a guy and put him through iteration after iteration after iteration

570
00:46:34.06 --> 00:46:38.54
because he's dead if he's bad so you can't really it's not a laboratory it's a real world test

571
00:46:38.54 --> 00:46:44.06
is combat a better real world test then then going through training yes it is but the training

572
00:46:44.06 --> 00:46:52.46
that we had was really crazy good it was realistic it was hard and you would see guys develop these

573
00:46:52.46 --> 00:46:56.94
traits you would watch guys you'd see them and you'd put them into situation and they've

574
00:46:56.94 --> 00:47:01.10
lose their mind or they'd start getting getting panic or they'd start freaking out about

575
00:47:01.10 --> 00:47:05.02
something and you'd see everything would fall apart they're both who moved fall apart

576
00:47:05.82 --> 00:47:09.90
and then maybe you know the next time you said you know you say you're debrief from hey listen man

577
00:47:09.90 --> 00:47:14.14
when you start yelling and screaming on the radio no one's listening to you anymore it's not

578
00:47:14.14 --> 00:47:19.18
getting through anybody they can't make sense of what you're saying you need to calm down you need

579
00:47:19.18 --> 00:47:22.78
to think about what you're gonna say simple clearing exercise language so you breathe from on that

580
00:47:22.78 --> 00:47:27.66
and then the next time maybe they start getting excited you go hey man hey Fred come here take a wrap off

581
00:47:28.22 --> 00:47:30.62
think about what you're gonna say what are you gonna tell your pertune to do I'm gonna tell

582
00:47:30.62 --> 00:47:34.70
to get oh no hold on what are you gonna tell me do I'm gonna tell them to get hold on what are you

583
00:47:34.70 --> 00:47:40.54
telling them to do I'm gonna tell them to move to building 34 okay now come up on the radio and just say that or just

584
00:47:40.54 --> 00:47:46.30
yell it just just put the word out and they need to see the guy do it and you could see that they

585
00:47:46.30 --> 00:47:51.50
would learn so yes you can absolutely learn this stuff as long as you're humble enough to

586
00:47:52.30 --> 00:47:57.58
as long as you're humble enough to take criticism and and assess yourself so there was a bunch of

587
00:47:57.58 --> 00:48:02.22
things that that you can improve that look there's some things that you can't improve that right

588
00:48:02.22 --> 00:48:07.74
there's some genetic things that you have that you can't improve um this is another thing I wrote

589
00:48:07.74 --> 00:48:12.22
about leadership strategy tax set a guy coming through he's a tasky to commander super smart guy

590
00:48:12.78 --> 00:48:20.38
good tactician the voice of a mouse right so when it came time to put out word you know like

591
00:48:20.38 --> 00:48:26.14
to tell everyone what was going on he just didn't have the couldn't project his voice at all

592
00:48:26.14 --> 00:48:30.78
and so I'm talking to him like hey man listen you gotta start you gotta start putting the word out

593
00:48:30.78 --> 00:48:35.90
and in my mind I'm thinking you know maybe this is just maybe I'm just super biased towards being

594
00:48:35.90 --> 00:48:41.10
loud because I have a loud voice maybe I'm just biased and so I'm watching him and I can see he's

595
00:48:41.10 --> 00:48:46.38
trying to put out word no one can hear it's a problem so I say hey man if you don't start

596
00:48:47.42 --> 00:48:52.06
up being your volume people can't hear you I don't even know if you can do this job

597
00:48:52.06 --> 00:48:57.18
which is a real like horrible thing to tell someone this guy's a tasky to commander he's been

598
00:48:57.18 --> 00:49:01.34
in the teams for 12 or 15 years or something this has seen your guy and now I'm telling him how you

599
00:49:01.34 --> 00:49:09.82
can't do this and then the next iteration I'm watching him and he's got to make the call and he

600
00:49:09.82 --> 00:49:15.10
grabs like big mouth bill it is put to one of the tunes is like hey bill tell everyone he

601
00:49:15.10 --> 00:49:21.18
get to building 34 now and I was like oh cool problem solved so you've got to you've got some

602
00:49:21.18 --> 00:49:25.42
things that you can't get better at you know some people aren't articulate talking in front of a

603
00:49:25.42 --> 00:49:29.82
crowd okay cool hey echo you're good in front of a crowd you put the word out to the troops or

604
00:49:29.82 --> 00:49:34.22
some people can't simplify a problem so it's like hey Mike I'm having a hard time getting through this

605
00:49:34.22 --> 00:49:38.06
can you simplify this thing so I'm gonna can understand it so there's some things that you're

606
00:49:38.06 --> 00:49:43.50
gonna naturally not gonna be great at put your leadership team together where you got some people

607
00:49:43.50 --> 00:49:46.46
that are good at that and then be humble enough to say you know what Mike's a lot better at

608
00:49:46.46 --> 00:49:49.82
simplifying things that I am and that goes a lot more articulate than I am so I'm gonna have

609
00:49:49.82 --> 00:49:53.10
Mike figure out the problem and I'm gonna have echo talk about it and we're gonna be good to go

610
00:49:53.10 --> 00:49:58.86
I'm gonna sit back and just try and get these guys what they need so there are things that you

611
00:49:58.86 --> 00:50:01.50
can not get better at you can you can you can you can you can you improve them a little bit but you

612
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:06.30
might not become an expert out of but there's there's definitely some things that you can

613
00:50:06.30 --> 00:50:10.94
absolutely improve on and being calm and being able to detach and take a step back is

614
00:50:11.58 --> 00:50:17.74
most certainly most certainly one of them so that was your system between command I was

615
00:50:17.74 --> 00:50:22.46
at anything else I was you got one story on that deployment about kind of getting help it was this

616
00:50:22.46 --> 00:50:30.22
when you got held up at gunpoint yeah talk us through that so 1996 we were the squad in in

617
00:50:30.22 --> 00:50:35.90
Peru squads eight seals so it's myself and in seven guys and you know we were just training

618
00:50:35.90 --> 00:50:42.70
the proven seals nothing crazy and the I will say that in those days the leader of the shining

619
00:50:42.70 --> 00:50:48.22
path Cendero Lumino so which was a terrorist organization was in jail about a mile or less

620
00:50:48.22 --> 00:50:54.94
in a mile from the Peruvian seals compound so we were likely you know watched or people knew

621
00:50:54.94 --> 00:51:01.10
that there was somebody in country helping the Peruvian seals but myself and my LPO stayed back in

622
00:51:01.10 --> 00:51:06.30
Lima for just a day while the rest of the guys flew forward to a Kidos Peru which was deep in

623
00:51:06.30 --> 00:51:12.70
the jungles of the Amazon and and we just literally out to dinner one night driving back from dinner

624
00:51:12.70 --> 00:51:20.62
unarmed and two cop cars pinned us in really really quickly jumped out with three or four guys

625
00:51:20.62 --> 00:51:26.38
armed you know rifles and you know basically open the door held me a gunpoint threatened me with

626
00:51:26.38 --> 00:51:31.50
execution and and they drove us around and basically interrogated us asked us a bunch of

627
00:51:32.06 --> 00:51:36.38
questions that nobody ever really wants to answer you know how you want to be tortured how you want to be

628
00:51:36.38 --> 00:51:41.58
executed how you want to die you know and and and a lot of worse things than that I had a

629
00:51:41.58 --> 00:51:45.58
point where I could have jumped out of the car that might my LPO can need him was in the back

630
00:51:46.22 --> 00:51:51.10
of the sesuvias in the middle seats and I could have jumped out when the car was going 40 years

631
00:51:51.10 --> 00:51:57.26
so saved myself and I very very vividly remember I can never ever jump out of this car because I

632
00:51:57.26 --> 00:52:03.42
couldn't live with myself if I bailed on Ken and I lived and they killed him just not who I wanted

633
00:52:03.42 --> 00:52:07.74
it back to the migrant fathers and who do you want to be so you know we learned never bail on your

634
00:52:07.74 --> 00:52:13.18
swim buddy and I was not I was fortunate after that incident because I could answer really

635
00:52:13.18 --> 00:52:18.22
really truthfully knowing that in a life and death situation that I would not bail on my swim buddy

636
00:52:18.22 --> 00:52:24.94
so it was a a lot of learning at a young age how do you get out of that scenario you know I did

637
00:52:24.94 --> 00:52:32.78
what I what I would have wanted victims to do if I were in the other role don't look at the victim

638
00:52:32.78 --> 00:52:36.78
so we can't identify or excuse me don't look at the assailants so that we can't identify them

639
00:52:36.78 --> 00:52:42.46
and the threat goes down and and just be compliant and answer to our previous part of the conversation

640
00:52:42.46 --> 00:52:48.78
around calm I was so overcome these you would never think that I was even 1% remotely worried about

641
00:52:48.78 --> 00:52:53.66
the situation I was in I in Spanish I was like hey where economists were desk workers we work at the

642
00:52:53.66 --> 00:52:57.90
at the embassy and you know we were just out to dinner these things happen all the time if we get it you

643
00:52:57.90 --> 00:53:03.74
guys need the car take the car we have insurance go take it it's all that's all you and and just

644
00:53:03.74 --> 00:53:08.30
really totally mellow answer these questions and I think these guys just figured out these guys

645
00:53:08.30 --> 00:53:13.42
aren't a threat these guys these guys can't possibly be seals so so so they drove us around

646
00:53:13.42 --> 00:53:17.34
and after the interrogation of about an hour they brought us out of the car gun point now is like

647
00:53:17.34 --> 00:53:21.02
okay there's the point where they either pull the trigger they don't myself and Ken just kept

648
00:53:21.02 --> 00:53:26.06
walking because I remember very vividly thinking hey a 10 foot shot is harder than a 0 foot shot

649
00:53:26.62 --> 00:53:30.46
you know maybe they'll miss an organ and so I just quickly put space between me and the

650
00:53:30.46 --> 00:53:34.14
guy who had a gun and at the point he just I wasn't looking backwards so I can't tell you what

651
00:53:34.14 --> 00:53:39.34
he was doing I was just ready to be shot and and they they never pulled the trigger

652
00:53:41.90 --> 00:53:47.50
that doesn't sound like a very nice last day in the in the city of there I have not been back to

653
00:53:47.50 --> 00:53:54.14
Lima and so that's what you did on that deployment you travel around this is pre 911 you're

654
00:53:54.14 --> 00:54:01.10
traveling around your training other forces and and then what happens after that after that

655
00:54:01.10 --> 00:54:06.86
tour is that that's when you go to Germany went to a DLI for learning German for nine months

656
00:54:07.66 --> 00:54:12.86
then ended up you know just going over to Germany oh you went to DLI first I did yeah

657
00:54:13.82 --> 00:54:19.98
so you speak three languages then well you can't tell what the count no I'm still working on English

658
00:54:19.98 --> 00:54:28.06
so you go to DLI and then you come over to Germany this is where I meet you 97 98

659
00:54:28.06 --> 00:54:34.22
98 because I went I basically got done with OCS I showed up at Sealtime 2 and immediately went over there

660
00:54:35.66 --> 00:54:44.38
and it was the Master Chief there who was one of my platoon chiefs and apparently the conversation

661
00:54:44.38 --> 00:54:49.82
went the the commander over there or or an ops officer said hey we need like a we need someone to

662
00:54:49.82 --> 00:54:56.06
come and help out with with ops and they were sending their sending this ensin and they're saying

663
00:54:56.06 --> 00:54:59.90
who the the cus are sending us team 2 sent us a damn ensin like what good is this guy going to do and

664
00:54:59.90 --> 00:55:05.90
then then the Master Chief sees my name and goes away to second I know this guy so you say that name again

665
00:55:05.90 --> 00:55:12.62
ensin will link we want this guy over here that's so sure enough I showed up and we played water polo

666
00:55:13.58 --> 00:55:17.66
yeah I don't know what what we did beside that if in all truth we probably filled out some

667
00:55:17.66 --> 00:55:23.34
forms and almost like in the almost the pre computer days you know so I don't know what in the world

668
00:55:23.34 --> 00:55:28.54
we possibly we weren't delete and email in those days well I'll tell you a funny story we went to

669
00:55:28.54 --> 00:55:36.38
we did some big joint exercise and the the skipper at the time he's like all right jokko you're

670
00:55:36.38 --> 00:55:41.74
going to go forward and we're going to you're going to run the the tech cooperation center and like

671
00:55:41.74 --> 00:55:47.02
you know these days we think of a tech cooperation center you know we're talking plasma TV's

672
00:55:47.02 --> 00:55:52.38
in satellite links and internet you're talking you know like a star track look in scenario

673
00:55:52.94 --> 00:55:59.10
I shit you not we went on this mission and I fit this quote tactical operation center into

674
00:55:59.10 --> 00:56:03.74
one single rock sack I had like a sack for seventy seven hundred dollars something I had a bunch

675
00:56:03.74 --> 00:56:08.54
of maps I had some like I thought I was square away because I had you know like some overlays for the

676
00:56:08.54 --> 00:56:16.54
maps and then how much the world changed between that time so this is 1998 what I literally had the

677
00:56:16.54 --> 00:56:20.86
tactical operation I mean this isn't a big exercise a big giant joint exercise that was taking place all

678
00:56:20.86 --> 00:56:25.74
over Europe and I had a little you know we had a little the the seals there had a little roll

679
00:56:25.74 --> 00:56:30.94
in this exercise but it was a big exercise a lot of stuff going on and I literally had the entire

680
00:56:30.94 --> 00:56:39.18
tactical operation center set in in my rock sack that's that's scary that's some good times right there

681
00:56:40.62 --> 00:56:45.02
so then how how long you how long you spend in Germany for two years and that was the

682
00:56:45.02 --> 00:56:49.82
Bosnia coast of Odez and so there was some good learning there too and and I I felt like

683
00:56:50.54 --> 00:56:56.38
I would be a better platoon commander if I went overseas at a role like that for two years and

684
00:56:56.38 --> 00:57:00.86
honestly those two years really set me up to be in my in my opinion a much better platoon

685
00:57:00.86 --> 00:57:07.18
commander when I got to seal teammate in 99 yeah and and just kind of had some epic leadership over

686
00:57:07.18 --> 00:57:13.58
there too the unit that you were at I mean those leaders are just incredible leadership over there

687
00:57:13.58 --> 00:57:22.46
incredible really strong Rick smother's yeah yeah just great guys that awesome times um

688
00:57:22.46 --> 00:57:26.54
any major so it's through when you say all there's there's lessons that I learned or the

689
00:57:26.54 --> 00:57:31.82
things that I got from that deployment I mean is it just learning what it's like from the other

690
00:57:31.82 --> 00:57:37.90
side when you're on deployment yeah it's it's some taking a look at a seal platoon and saying

691
00:57:37.90 --> 00:57:43.50
what is the effective employment of a seal platoon when you're in the platoon you're a little

692
00:57:43.50 --> 00:57:49.90
bit I don't want to say biased you're you have a narrow view you know and so understanding the

693
00:57:49.90 --> 00:57:55.66
difference between what success and you know and I wouldn't say failure but like some average

694
00:57:55.66 --> 00:58:01.82
performance is was really important to me because you know hearing having the opportunity at a

695
00:58:01.82 --> 00:58:07.82
a young age at a junior seniority to see the senior leadership say hey that was really awesome

696
00:58:07.82 --> 00:58:13.90
or what the hell are those guys doing just those statements themselves carried value I was um

697
00:58:15.02 --> 00:58:21.10
in training sell at seal team one so I was like an E5 and I went on my first trip

698
00:58:21.10 --> 00:58:26.86
where I was kind of like the trip lead and it was to floored a to hurl but field floored a

699
00:58:26.86 --> 00:58:31.50
and we put a platoon out in the field for a recon and whatever and like they they flew down

700
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:34.62
there went right in the field they might have even jumped into the field but anyways they go

701
00:58:34.62 --> 00:58:37.58
down there they go right in the field and of course I was there on the ad von getting the target

702
00:58:37.58 --> 00:58:43.10
set up and all this stuff and then they get done with the operation and we pull them out of the

703
00:58:43.10 --> 00:58:49.90
field and now they've got whatever it is three days in four wall and beach for a while and I'm like

704
00:58:49.90 --> 00:58:57.18
for it was the first time that I saw a platoon from the outside and I was like oh my god this is

705
00:58:57.18 --> 00:59:03.74
going to be a problem like there's no way he's got you're going to get through three days of

706
00:59:03.74 --> 00:59:08.14
liberty here we this is going to be crazy and I remember that was the first time I was

707
00:59:08.14 --> 00:59:11.98
not in a platoon because we're in a platoon you don't you just like oh we can go out now cool

708
00:59:11.98 --> 00:59:17.18
oh we're done with our op cool we're going to go out and do whatever we want in whatever we are

709
00:59:17.58 --> 00:59:22.30
and that was like the first time I saw it from the outside and it was a good learning lesson for me

710
00:59:22.30 --> 00:59:27.02
yeah you know like we often see now it's you don't know what you don't know and so how do you

711
00:59:27.82 --> 00:59:32.78
take things from that unknown unknown quadrant and make them known I like whether it's the seals or

712
00:59:32.78 --> 00:59:38.14
in business all of the risk and all of the opportunity is in that unknown unknown quadrant so how do you

713
00:59:38.14 --> 00:59:43.02
get into that and identify and pull it back out so we didn't realize it in those days but that's what we were

714
00:59:43.02 --> 00:59:53.82
doing yeah it's uh if you that's another lesson another uh should say a reiteration of the lesson

715
00:59:53.82 --> 00:59:58.78
of to take a step back and see something because when you're in that platoon you don't you don't

716
00:59:58.78 --> 01:00:02.94
you've been on the plymet before you knew what it was like to go on the plymet but you were in a

717
01:00:02.94 --> 01:00:08.46
platoon and so you don't like know the perspective of not being in the platoon and not understanding

718
01:00:08.46 --> 01:00:13.42
what that looks like from the outside and not understanding what it looks like when there's some

719
01:00:13.42 --> 01:00:19.26
kind of an incident and how much that disrupts everyone and how much it hurts our reputation as seals

720
01:00:19.90 --> 01:00:23.10
you know that's something you know when you're in a siope to and someone gets in trouble you're like oh

721
01:00:23.10 --> 01:00:29.34
Fred got in trouble you don't think about it from you know what is the fleet think of that what is that army

722
01:00:29.34 --> 01:00:33.50
commander that's there think of those things you just don't well at least I didn't I had you know

723
01:00:33.50 --> 01:00:40.54
him as young dumb and well just young dumb I guess you're definitely just that yeah um

724
01:00:41.50 --> 01:00:46.70
so you wrap up there you wrap up there and then where you go seal teammate took over as a platoon commander

725
01:00:46.70 --> 01:00:55.50
and um did work up and then deployed down to a possible so what what year is it now so 99 I moved back

726
01:00:55.50 --> 01:01:03.42
to Virginia Beach and take over as a platoon commander and when you get there how how you how you feeling

727
01:01:03.42 --> 01:01:07.82
how you feeling to get your platoon do it so great it's like finally like I'm ready you know it's

728
01:01:07.82 --> 01:01:12.62
it's been a year of like put me in coach and then you're finally in and it's just off to the races

729
01:01:12.62 --> 01:01:18.38
and just you know it's you remember the feeling well I'm sure it's it's um it's everything it's

730
01:01:18.38 --> 01:01:23.74
cracked up to be in more and so you said you this is that teammate yeah and so now you guys are

731
01:01:24.54 --> 01:01:32.06
basically fighting to try and get to go back to you com yep and go to co-savo Bosnia whatever's

732
01:01:32.06 --> 01:01:37.50
happening in that theater because that's the only showing time but we we made it back and you know we

733
01:01:37.50 --> 01:01:43.82
did a deployment there where we were doing you know small four or six man special reconnaissance

734
01:01:43.82 --> 01:01:50.94
missions and you know we go out on three or four day ops and then we stand QRF for three or four

735
01:01:50.94 --> 01:01:56.54
days while another sister part of the you know would go out and then and then we'd have three or four

736
01:01:56.54 --> 01:02:01.58
days off so we were actually in quite a regular predictable cycle while we were overseas

737
01:02:01.58 --> 01:02:08.22
you talk a little bit about one of these operations here in the book here we go I was in

738
01:02:08.22 --> 01:02:12.62
co-savo in 1999 in the middle of winter leading a small surveillance team in the mountains

739
01:02:12.62 --> 01:02:17.74
just a few hundred meters from the Serbian border freezing cold temperatures the darkness of night

740
01:02:17.74 --> 01:02:24.70
howling winds and both co-savar Serbian and Albanian armies somewhere in that same snowy terrain

741
01:02:24.70 --> 01:02:30.30
weapons ready looking for an enemy to fight as we suffered through the elements the sun

742
01:02:30.30 --> 01:02:36.30
soon to rise we knew we needed to find a place to rest and hide for the daylight hours from our

743
01:02:36.30 --> 01:02:41.18
vantage point halfway up the side of a mountain struggling to maintain our balance on the steeply

744
01:02:41.18 --> 01:02:47.02
sloping ground we could see a natural line of drift below railroad tracks a 10 foot wide patch

745
01:02:47.02 --> 01:02:52.54
of flat ground a path that could that would have called out to anyone as the comfortable place

746
01:02:52.54 --> 01:02:58.30
we should naturally set up camp of course we wanted to move down there I remember a young guy and

747
01:02:58.30 --> 01:03:04.54
our team in credulous that we could even be out in this kind of weather humans can't survive in this

748
01:03:04.54 --> 01:03:11.18
he said it's miserable the temptation to head down toward the easier path and the more comfortable

749
01:03:11.18 --> 01:03:16.14
sight was real but if it was calling out to us we knew it would be calling out to anyone who

750
01:03:16.14 --> 01:03:22.06
happened to be coming that way going down there would make us more visible more vulnerable and

751
01:03:22.06 --> 01:03:28.54
more likely to run into trouble so we set up camp a couple hundred year meters up the steeply

752
01:03:28.54 --> 01:03:34.06
angled slope and sure enough within an hour and just a short time before sunrise what looked like

753
01:03:34.06 --> 01:03:40.70
the entire Albanian army marched straight down that natural line of drift had we been camped there

754
01:03:40.70 --> 01:03:47.74
they would have found us for sure doing the uncomfortable exhausting thing the hard thing saved us

755
01:03:47.74 --> 01:03:55.34
that day so those are the type of operations you were doing yeah you're a great reader by the way

756
01:03:56.70 --> 01:04:04.06
yes did you did you guys do winter warfare in your workup we did and this was after I guess

757
01:04:04.06 --> 01:04:10.14
teammate or sorry team two had sort of given up the the the the the the the the rock they had on winter

758
01:04:10.14 --> 01:04:15.50
warfare they they did and you know it was all of you know four or six weeks or something like that

759
01:04:15.50 --> 01:04:21.58
in the Colorado what are they 13,000 or 14,000 mean foot peaks and so we did you know slept in snow caves

760
01:04:21.58 --> 01:04:27.02
and attempted to get good at telemark but certainly get good at that snow-showing and we did all the

761
01:04:27.02 --> 01:04:31.82
winter workup and and it really paid off because those operations in Kosovo were sometimes really

762
01:04:31.82 --> 01:04:36.78
miserable from a weather perspective and and then on that particular passage you just read I mean

763
01:04:36.78 --> 01:04:40.94
I just very vividly remember thinking like if we would have given in and done the easy thing there

764
01:04:40.94 --> 01:04:46.30
we we probably would not have survived we at a minimum would have been captured and interrogated

765
01:04:49.02 --> 01:04:55.82
that so you you did us full six month appointment down in that AO yes and you're doing pretty much

766
01:04:55.82 --> 01:05:01.02
three days on in the field three days on a QRF and then three days off yes with four stage

767
01:05:01.02 --> 01:05:05.18
of QRF and sleep in a home beef for three days or you know just be at the ready to go help

768
01:05:05.18 --> 01:05:09.98
whoever is in the field maybe you know ten or so kilometers or whatever it might be from the

769
01:05:09.98 --> 01:05:19.10
main element anyone ever get contacted we did on one operation it actually was the quick story is

770
01:05:19.10 --> 01:05:26.54
that we observed and arms transfer recall we were enforcing the date and piece of chords and and and we saw

771
01:05:27.10 --> 01:05:29.82
Russian forces handing weapons to

772
01:05:31.58 --> 01:05:37.66
Serbians which is not the date and piece of chords and this is early early in the day of no

773
01:05:37.66 --> 01:05:45.50
light you know no light cameras and near real time sat calm sending it back so we we got pictures

774
01:05:46.14 --> 01:05:52.46
and to documented the whole thing and then we weren't set up to do any sort of offensive

775
01:05:52.46 --> 01:05:56.46
operations you know we had a whatever 80 pound packs for three days and you know as many ham

776
01:05:56.46 --> 01:06:03.42
sandwiches as you could stuff in your backpack but the the there was a nearby army special forces

777
01:06:03.42 --> 01:06:07.34
house that that could get out get out and get underway we called them in they went and looked through

778
01:06:07.34 --> 01:06:13.74
the the building where the transfer had happened and I mean I just assumed that that meant we would

779
01:06:13.74 --> 01:06:19.66
be our mission would be over you know the age old saying if you assume if you think you've been

780
01:06:19.66 --> 01:06:24.46
compromised assume you have and if you have expel and this was a leadership thing I got put

781
01:06:24.46 --> 01:06:28.86
against the army major at the time who was in charge of the the soxie the special operations

782
01:06:28.86 --> 01:06:35.18
command and control element said Charlie Mike and continue mission and I was never remember

783
01:06:35.18 --> 01:06:38.94
over computer kind of getting in a little bit of an argument with him saying hey here's what we

784
01:06:38.94 --> 01:06:43.74
do in the seals this means we're over ultimately talked about it with a couple of us the six of

785
01:06:43.74 --> 01:06:48.30
us that were in the field said a boy's what do we think here is this is let we have time to talk

786
01:06:48.30 --> 01:06:52.22
this through and and everybody said you know what it's let's let's let's just continue mission

787
01:06:52.22 --> 01:06:56.46
let's not make this an issue we don't feel that threatened so so we just catch everyone up here

788
01:06:56.46 --> 01:07:01.18
so you're in the field you see this weapons transfer and you're you do this you you tell the story

789
01:07:01.18 --> 01:07:06.14
in the book with with great detail and it's an awesome story but you're you're in the field you're

790
01:07:06.14 --> 01:07:12.94
doing a reconnaissance you see this weapons transfer take place and it's illegal and it shouldn't

791
01:07:12.94 --> 01:07:17.50
be happening and you actually get photographs of it and you push those up over satcom which but

792
01:07:17.50 --> 01:07:22.30
this is not like the movies this is this is a legit effort to get that done and very cool that

793
01:07:22.30 --> 01:07:26.78
you guys were able to pull that off you get photographs of this weapons transfer taking place

794
01:07:27.50 --> 01:07:31.26
and then you send that up the chain of command and what the chain of command does is push

795
01:07:31.26 --> 01:07:38.30
his special forces group out to go inspect the area which clearly anyone with

796
01:07:39.26 --> 01:07:44.94
any sort of tactical sense is going to go oh we just did a weapons transfer and now the

797
01:07:44.94 --> 01:07:50.86
US military's there there's someone watching and so your thought is okay once the green

798
01:07:50.86 --> 01:07:55.50
berets go and inspect that site we need to get that out of here well you get told by the chain

799
01:07:55.50 --> 01:07:59.58
of command no you're not leaving you're gonna stay eyes on and this is where you have the

800
01:07:59.58 --> 01:08:04.94
discussion hold on a second what do you mean stay here and so that's where you're on so what's

801
01:08:04.94 --> 01:08:12.54
the decision so we we stayed and then not a few hours later we were being you know actively hunted by

802
01:08:12.54 --> 01:08:17.66
we counted 19 armed individuals looking through this treeline and trying to figure out where we were

803
01:08:17.66 --> 01:08:26.06
and you know we were set up with two OP's observation posts and then one CP command post so so

804
01:08:26.06 --> 01:08:30.94
two six people in the field two two and two I was in the command post with my my radioman

805
01:08:30.94 --> 01:08:35.42
and I did not have eyes on I was back a bit and then there's in one of the command in one of the

806
01:08:35.42 --> 01:08:43.42
observation posts Chad Wilkinson who you know rest in peace hero you had Sarah Wilkinson

807
01:08:43.42 --> 01:08:48.30
and I don't know another amazing American hero on your your show recently just you know one of my

808
01:08:48.30 --> 01:08:54.54
life long friends and basically radio back to me it's at hey boss we got to make a decision here

809
01:08:54.54 --> 01:08:59.50
we're there's somebody coming down the treeline and we either need to you know take them out

810
01:08:59.50 --> 01:09:05.74
or fall back and I just said listen Chad here's the deal if you you take him out just know that

811
01:09:05.74 --> 01:09:10.46
we're gonna have you already know this well 18 other people hunting us even more actively but do

812
01:09:10.46 --> 01:09:16.14
whatever you think is right and I'm behind you and and he ultimately with one of the guys he was

813
01:09:16.14 --> 01:09:22.22
with pulled back took eyes off didn't shoot and to this day I think that was one of the greatest

814
01:09:22.22 --> 01:09:27.50
decisions ever because we the six of us got back together and then we just worked our way out of a

815
01:09:27.50 --> 01:09:33.18
really tricky problem I remember two or three times having my weapon in hand coming off safe

816
01:09:33.18 --> 01:09:39.74
finger on the trigger with like an Albanian you know insurgent if you will walking feet from me

817
01:09:39.74 --> 01:09:45.26
and saying okay please don't let me have to shoot this guy because it'll be a bad day and we made it out

818
01:09:45.26 --> 01:09:53.26
we ultimately made it out yeah and this is like I said and it's hard for people to really

819
01:09:53.26 --> 01:09:58.30
it might be hard for people to comprehend this this is pre 9 11 so you're out there doing real

820
01:09:58.94 --> 01:10:04.62
operations before the war kicks off and getting yourself into leadership situations and

821
01:10:04.62 --> 01:10:12.78
learning a lot and really being pretty being pretty lucky in that situation for sure

822
01:10:14.78 --> 01:10:20.70
so you could done with that deployment and then what do you do next well I screen to go to

823
01:10:20.70 --> 01:10:26.54
seal team six and as you know they take only a handful of officers every year and I screen positive

824
01:10:26.54 --> 01:10:30.54
I needed to come back from deployment just a couple of weeks early to go to what they call green

825
01:10:30.54 --> 01:10:34.54
team and my commanding officer said Mike you can't come home early you can apply again

826
01:10:34.54 --> 01:10:40.38
next year and I just remember being so disappointed and and I came home and I was like you know what

827
01:10:40.38 --> 01:10:45.98
forget this I'm I just don't see a future in the seals for me after this and and that's right around

828
01:10:45.98 --> 01:10:50.38
that was literally the time when we started deploying again as two platoons going overseas and

829
01:10:50.38 --> 01:10:55.02
they said Mike I got a different job for you stay here at seal team eight be in charge of two seal

830
01:10:55.02 --> 01:11:00.94
platoons and I had a hard decision to make because I just wanted to go to development group and

831
01:11:00.94 --> 01:11:05.98
and be the best of the best and and in those days like that's where you went if you really wanted to

832
01:11:05.98 --> 01:11:12.22
you know be in the mix the regular teams weren't in the mix nearly as much and I just

833
01:11:12.86 --> 01:11:19.10
ultimately you know like many times in life don't don't overreact and stay calm and think about

834
01:11:19.10 --> 01:11:24.70
what's the best thing and and to this day I'm I look back at that decision as Mike Mike

835
01:11:24.70 --> 01:11:28.46
as as incredibly fortuitous because my life wouldn't have paned out the way it did and so

836
01:11:28.46 --> 01:11:33.42
you know nine eleven happened and all of us in the teams had way more work than we ever would have

837
01:11:33.42 --> 01:11:37.98
wanted and so life works out you don't always think it does in the moment when you get really

838
01:11:37.98 --> 01:11:42.54
frustrated with a decision that's not breaking your way but when you zoom out over time things usually

839
01:11:42.54 --> 01:11:49.26
work out where were you in September 11th happened I was on the pull-up bars at seal team eight

840
01:11:51.26 --> 01:11:57.26
handful of us just doing a command PT and just really just never forget the moment

841
01:11:57.26 --> 01:12:03.34
so at this point were you a task unit commander this was yeah I was a in charge of two

842
01:12:03.34 --> 01:12:08.38
seal platoons and we were in them in our work up we weren't close to being deployed overseas but

843
01:12:08.38 --> 01:12:12.78
like everything we were scrambling and I actually remember there were questions like who knows

844
01:12:12.78 --> 01:12:16.62
how to operate singer missiles this is when there are planes in the sky nobody knew what was going on

845
01:12:16.62 --> 01:12:23.98
and and we were getting ready to go you know you are basically protect the ships and just

846
01:12:23.98 --> 01:12:28.62
homeland defense if you will if that's what it took so we ended up not doing any of that but just

847
01:12:28.62 --> 01:12:34.06
watching on TV just like everybody else but but as you know that that infamous day really changed

848
01:12:34.06 --> 01:12:37.98
all of our future and then where did you go on deployment when you so now did you take that task

849
01:12:37.98 --> 01:12:46.54
unit on deployment we we did and and we went over to Germany in Europe at the European command and we were

850
01:12:46.54 --> 01:12:54.62
we were really ready to go and didn't get put into the mix early on so it again a little bit

851
01:12:54.62 --> 01:12:59.02
disappointing and I said to myself what in the world I'm sitting here as a task unit commander

852
01:12:59.74 --> 01:13:05.26
ready to serve the nation and we have forces at the ready but but we're in the wrong theater

853
01:13:05.26 --> 01:13:09.58
and there was talk about every day there was talk about pulling us from Europe over at

854
01:13:09.58 --> 01:13:14.78
you calm over to set calm to help out it didn't happen and again I said all right you know what

855
01:13:14.78 --> 01:13:19.58
if this is the way that things are going to break I applied for the the Paul Mill Fellowship the

856
01:13:19.58 --> 01:13:23.90
political military fellowship no seal had ever been picked for two years of fully funded grad school

857
01:13:24.46 --> 01:13:28.54
and I said all right I'm at the stage of life where I need to to think about other things and

858
01:13:28.54 --> 01:13:32.70
I thought let me just put my name in the hat here and I was the lucky squirrel that was picked and

859
01:13:32.70 --> 01:13:38.06
I got two years of fully funded grad school and then went to to grad school in Cambridge mass

860
01:13:38.06 --> 01:13:44.30
for for two years from 0 3 to 0 5 so the whole early phase of the war I was largely an observer

861
01:13:45.18 --> 01:13:51.98
when you there's a I asked often about this especially from young seal leaders right now

862
01:13:53.18 --> 01:13:58.70
because you know every seal joins this well you hope that every seal joins the teams because they

863
01:13:58.70 --> 01:14:04.14
want to go to war and then there's no wars going on how was it so you're in a task unit you

864
01:14:04.14 --> 01:14:09.50
got a fully capable task unit you've September 11th has happened when when is this deployment to

865
01:14:09.50 --> 01:14:17.02
you come um like 2001 so that would have been yeah oh one it was oh one yeah so you go on to

866
01:14:17.02 --> 01:14:24.62
appointment oh one oh two and you've got a bunch of hungry frog men and they're sitting around in Europe

867
01:14:24.62 --> 01:14:30.46
it's exactly right what's the what what did you do to try and keep your your forces focused on

868
01:14:30.46 --> 01:14:39.02
the mission at hand pull ups yeah that's a rough one that was a rough one as well I've

869
01:14:39.02 --> 01:14:44.46
I've told many young seals that I was in the seal teams for 13 years before I ever shot my weapon

870
01:14:44.46 --> 01:14:48.86
at the enemy and you don't know and all you can do is keep going keep doing what

871
01:14:48.86 --> 01:14:52.22
workups and keep going on deployment keep training that's the best thing you can do is keep

872
01:14:52.22 --> 01:14:56.70
don't workups keep going on deployment keep trying to get better and they're the the

873
01:14:56.70 --> 01:15:03.34
naysets gonna call at some point totally great so you are you think and maybe once you get

874
01:15:03.34 --> 01:15:06.94
done with that deployment sounds like you're also the new young frog man that's pretty fast

875
01:15:06.94 --> 01:15:13.42
off and not going to war so you apply to go to school you go up you get you think you're going

876
01:15:13.42 --> 01:15:18.46
to get out after that or you're incurred three your obligation so at that point I had

877
01:15:18.46 --> 01:15:22.30
done on a twelve or so years in but I was like I I wanted to finish twenty years with a master's

878
01:15:22.30 --> 01:15:27.34
degree and so you know the Kennedy School of Government was a really good path you know being the first

879
01:15:27.34 --> 01:15:32.22
seal for this program I thought great I applied at Harvard Business School and then the detail

880
01:15:32.22 --> 01:15:36.70
it was like way that's a little too far off the reservation you can do a master's in public policy

881
01:15:37.26 --> 01:15:43.74
at the Kennedy School and I applied there and and got in so that was um that took me from 03 to 05

882
01:15:43.74 --> 01:15:49.26
and then as you know a date burn in every seals head is June 28 2005 I had orders to seal

883
01:15:49.26 --> 01:15:54.22
team 10 all the guys on the other helicopter were all teammates from seal team 8 and uh and I

884
01:15:54.22 --> 01:15:59.34
went overseas right away and took over for for Eric Christians and God rest him and uh and basically

885
01:15:59.34 --> 01:16:10.62
took over for the guys who were in who weren't shot down on June 28 2005 so so so so so so

886
01:16:12.06 --> 01:16:16.06
that shot that shot that that that shit happened um I don't know what to better what to say

887
01:16:16.06 --> 01:16:23.02
it and you are the guy that goes then to team 10 and you go on deployment and you take over

888
01:16:23.74 --> 01:16:28.62
for Christiansen yep I'd already been a task unit commander and I was like so privileged to be

889
01:16:28.62 --> 01:16:33.98
able to do it again I you know I felt like my calling was to help all the guys who were um

890
01:16:34.86 --> 01:16:41.18
who lived through that who really had a hard a really hard day you write in the book about some of the

891
01:16:41.18 --> 01:16:48.94
things that you implemented to try and help guys out from uh I guess a psychological and

892
01:16:48.94 --> 01:16:55.66
spiritual perspective talk us a little talk us through that a little bit not only um what you did

893
01:16:55.66 --> 01:17:01.26
but also what made you what gave you the awareness you know this is pretty early on in the war

894
01:17:01.98 --> 01:17:08.14
and you seem to be so you seem to somehow be instinctively or intuitively know that

895
01:17:08.14 --> 01:17:12.94
guys who are going to need some help yeah I think look I'd like to say in life I just have

896
01:17:12.94 --> 01:17:16.54
varying levels of ignorance on everything and some things I'm a little less ignorant on but this

897
01:17:16.54 --> 01:17:22.46
was definitely one of them uh I I in talking to the guys I realized that this isn't a problem we're

898
01:17:22.46 --> 01:17:27.82
going to solve alone kind of your voice example for the the the sweety voice guy or real here you know

899
01:17:27.82 --> 01:17:32.86
and so uh no what you're good at no what you're not good at no how to bring in teammates that that are

900
01:17:32.86 --> 01:17:38.22
better at things than you and and and so we I asked to have a psychologist and a chaplain come out

901
01:17:39.10 --> 01:17:43.66
and uh took everybody in the platoon aside and I said listen I've had one on one conversations

902
01:17:43.66 --> 01:17:47.18
with every single one of you you are all struggling with things in different different different

903
01:17:47.18 --> 01:17:52.94
things and in different ways I will never talk about any of our conversations with anybody else it's

904
01:17:52.94 --> 01:17:59.02
not it's not for public knowledge but but here's the deal um I I want every single one of you to

905
01:17:59.02 --> 01:18:03.90
spend at least five minutes with a chaplain and five minutes with a psych it's it was very counter-cultural

906
01:18:03.90 --> 01:18:10.78
at the time you know all we did and I was growing either strength or perceived strength and this

907
01:18:10.78 --> 01:18:16.86
was kind of like weakness and it could be perceived as weakness clearly not but um but in those

908
01:18:16.86 --> 01:18:21.26
days could be perceived as weakness and you know we we had the you know the guys who would you know

909
01:18:21.26 --> 01:18:25.82
beat their chest and say no fing way am I talking to the chaplain and blah blah blah and I was just like

910
01:18:25.82 --> 01:18:30.06
okay the way to get through this is make everybody do it and there'll be no stigma for who did

911
01:18:30.06 --> 01:18:36.86
who didn't talk and and there wasn't a single person who didn't talk less than several hours

912
01:18:36.86 --> 01:18:41.58
to each of the psych and the chaplain we had to extend them there for a couple weeks and and really

913
01:18:41.58 --> 01:18:45.82
I think set the foundation for a couple things number one is for each of those guys in their own

914
01:18:45.82 --> 01:18:51.10
lives as they dealt with you know the post-traumatic stress of of doing the body recoveries

915
01:18:51.10 --> 01:18:54.62
from the downhill a copter and and putting their buddies and bags and bringing them home

916
01:18:54.62 --> 01:18:59.90
which which clearly isn't easy and just the extreme loss of teammates and such it was the

917
01:18:59.90 --> 01:19:06.30
first-year-old mass casualty that the seal had in the modern era and so I just felt like it was

918
01:19:06.30 --> 01:19:12.06
a no-brainer to me to bring in to bring in help and then I ultimately as I return from that

919
01:19:12.06 --> 01:19:17.90
deployment made a real push to get a psychologist on the staff and to begin the era of of really

920
01:19:17.90 --> 01:19:24.46
saying asking for help is a sign of strength not weakness. Yeah you definitely get some credit

921
01:19:24.46 --> 01:19:32.54
for some foresight there because yeah that's that that culture that we have in the seal teams of like

922
01:19:32.54 --> 01:19:39.26
just suck it up just deal with it and that's just the way it's going to be for you to sort of

923
01:19:39.26 --> 01:19:46.94
see beyond that that's definitely that's an admirable move right there. We're just here to help each other

924
01:19:46.94 --> 01:19:58.86
um so you guys get done with that deployment and come home and and now what do you do now

925
01:19:58.86 --> 01:20:04.30
now are you the ops officer at 1010 or so. This is the era where the ops officer at a team became

926
01:20:04.86 --> 01:20:10.62
an O4 so I'd already been an ops officer is an O3 I became the ops officer as an O4 so

927
01:20:10.62 --> 01:20:14.78
this is why my career has been it was awesome I just spent that seal teams my whole life I never did

928
01:20:14.78 --> 01:20:19.50
a boat unit tour I never did an STV tour I just was in this perfect storm of always seal team

929
01:20:19.50 --> 01:20:23.98
seal team seal team so now I'm an ops officer again I already know how to do the job pretty decently

930
01:20:24.78 --> 01:20:33.02
we uh and that's really you know O5 all the way through late O7 which included a six month

931
01:20:33.02 --> 01:20:38.22
deployment as as the deputy commander for Soto Fwest and Onbar which you know very well I was I think

932
01:20:38.22 --> 01:20:45.26
one I was like a couple months after you is when I got there and um and so just you know some

933
01:20:45.26 --> 01:20:50.78
augmentations I got to get out to theater a couple times during the work up for a month we were

934
01:20:50.78 --> 01:20:58.30
really aggressively augmenting guys forward as you recall so so you guys roll out to Iraq and what

935
01:20:58.30 --> 01:21:06.30
2007 you take the team is going on deployment yeah it was um spring of O7 and this is this is when

936
01:21:06.30 --> 01:21:11.66
Jason Redmond's out with guys Redmond's when he got wounded and the other guys with him got wounded

937
01:21:12.46 --> 01:21:18.46
what was that deployment like from your perspective? That's where all my like it was

938
01:21:20.22 --> 01:21:24.86
night after night of stopping bad think people from doing bad things to good people you know we were

939
01:21:24.86 --> 01:21:31.34
literally like vampire hours one cycle of darkness operations you know as soon as the the the

940
01:21:31.34 --> 01:21:37.58
sun goes down that think about you know you very your operation do you leave the FoB at 1030 pm or 1145 pm you

941
01:21:37.58 --> 01:21:42.14
know it's like and and you remember these days really well but just one cycle of darkness you get back

942
01:21:42.14 --> 01:21:47.42
before sunrise you know you you lay down around six in the morning and you get back up at 10 a.m.

943
01:21:47.42 --> 01:21:52.70
and you rinse and repeat it was a really high up tempo and in Soto Fwest we had about I want to say

944
01:21:52.70 --> 01:21:58.22
about 15 or maybe 18 kind of outstations throughout the onbar province and so there's always something

945
01:21:58.22 --> 01:22:04.62
going on somewhere and I'll say I was I was really fortunate it was team 10 and team 7 came together

946
01:22:04.62 --> 01:22:13.34
we we so the CO team 7 was the CO of the the of onbar and I was the deputy commander and you know

947
01:22:13.34 --> 01:22:18.54
really privileged just a quick aside I one of my one of my favorite most memorable memorable

948
01:22:18.54 --> 01:22:24.30
buds instructors mark cramped and just beat the hell out of us and and and and used to do berm

949
01:22:24.30 --> 01:22:28.70
sprints and and just would get out there and lead from the front and I was just always so impressed

950
01:22:28.70 --> 01:22:34.06
with this man back in 93 when I went through training on this deployment in 2007 marks the command

951
01:22:34.06 --> 01:22:39.34
master chief for Sealtime 7 and one of my some of my greatest days when mark and I strap hang

952
01:22:39.34 --> 01:22:43.58
and go out on operations and literally the two of us you know two guys who didn't have to go on

953
01:22:43.58 --> 01:22:48.62
the operations going out every third night and it was just super meaningful for me and that's why

954
01:22:48.62 --> 01:22:56.22
you know as I I visited Coronado yesterday so one of the the way I started my workout was going

955
01:22:56.22 --> 01:23:03.02
to the very berm where where mark used to make us do those berm sprints and I just had some quiet

956
01:23:03.02 --> 01:23:07.90
time all by myself and just you know spoken my head to mark and you know just paid a huge tribute

957
01:23:07.90 --> 01:23:15.10
to him just yesterday and made myself super effing miserable and you know it's it's this is this is

958
01:23:15.10 --> 01:23:19.10
the weight that we all carry you know so for those you know mark marked by suicide about three

959
01:23:19.10 --> 01:23:26.70
weeks ago just before Easter this couple weeks ago yeah a guy that I never saw him without a smile on

960
01:23:26.70 --> 01:23:32.06
his face in my whole career never saw him without a smile on his face with a great attitude

961
01:23:32.06 --> 01:23:41.90
looking to help everybody just just just pure positivity and just shut the shocking I don't know

962
01:23:41.90 --> 01:23:50.86
how to explain it. Where you guys were you guys working with I Rackies was every element out there

963
01:23:50.86 --> 01:23:55.74
working with I Rackies. We were but you know as well as I do it was a lot of it was window dressing

964
01:23:56.30 --> 01:24:01.10
you know hey guys we got to start building these guys up we got to take you know six or 12

965
01:24:01.10 --> 01:24:06.54
I Rackies with a son the mission and it was early in the days of actually you know really

966
01:24:06.54 --> 01:24:12.94
committing to trying to build the Iraqi army. We tried we tried to build the Iraqi army and

967
01:24:13.98 --> 01:24:20.30
we would take them out and it was definitely the one of the biggest challenges was trying to work

968
01:24:20.30 --> 01:24:24.78
with the Iraqi army especially at that time and that's why it was very it was very rewarding when

969
01:24:24.78 --> 01:24:32.86
they pushed into the middle later in 2017, 1819 and the Iraqi did a lot of the fighting and they

970
01:24:32.86 --> 01:24:38.86
made incredible sacrifices which you know at the time when when I was there in 2006 you wouldn't

971
01:24:38.86 --> 01:24:46.14
anticipate them stepping up many of them stepping up at all you know there's if there was a few

972
01:24:46.14 --> 01:24:50.54
brave Iraqi soldiers for sure but a lot of them you would think about they're not going to be able to

973
01:24:50.54 --> 01:24:56.06
ever do this for themselves. Yeah well for us I mean so I got sprint that deployment started I think

974
01:24:56.06 --> 01:25:01.74
was March of O seven and I recall the peak of the insurgency by using the metric of attacks on

975
01:25:01.74 --> 01:25:05.66
Americans which we know is a flawed metric when you have more Americans or more attacks on Americans but

976
01:25:05.66 --> 01:25:12.54
the um but the there were the way to to kind of quantify it is my first 30 days in theater in

977
01:25:12.54 --> 01:25:20.06
Felusia we lost 35 Marines from the greater Felusia area and and so it was just night after night

978
01:25:20.06 --> 01:25:26.06
it we didn't we were in the real early innings of of being able to actually confidently take

979
01:25:26.06 --> 01:25:30.46
a lot of Iraqis out on operations and let them take the risk for their own nation.

980
01:25:32.94 --> 01:25:38.38
Where'd you bring back from that deployment for lessons learned? Wow that's a great question I think

981
01:25:38.38 --> 01:25:47.34
the the main thing is sustained operations the importance of of efficiency and making sure that that

982
01:25:48.38 --> 01:25:53.58
that you don't have seals or special forces doing things that don't take seals to do.

983
01:25:53.58 --> 01:25:58.78
You know when I grew up there was a little bit of an attitude in coming out of buds that's like

984
01:25:58.78 --> 01:26:03.58
I'm a seal you're not you know there's there's the seals and there's the non seals at the team and I

985
01:26:03.58 --> 01:26:08.70
think the you I know you live this way also the faster you learn that an integrated team

986
01:26:09.26 --> 01:26:13.82
is what it needs what it takes to be successful the faster your trajectories to success these are

987
01:26:13.82 --> 01:26:17.98
things that weren't learned quite as quickly in the early days but in that deployment all of the

988
01:26:17.98 --> 01:26:23.02
younger guys that that were able to hand off you know the Iraqis the the the the insurgents that they

989
01:26:23.74 --> 01:26:27.74
took off a target and hand them to somebody else to interrogate them and you know there's a lot of

990
01:26:27.74 --> 01:26:31.50
people that can ask questions in interrogate you don't have to be a seal to have that skill or

991
01:26:31.50 --> 01:26:36.46
intelligence analyst or whatever the case may be and so I think we got really good at saying what's the

992
01:26:36.46 --> 01:26:41.02
part of the job that just takes a seal to do what's that comparative advantage and then how do you

993
01:26:41.02 --> 01:26:48.78
hire people for everything else yeah you know I tell this to leaders all the time do you should

994
01:26:48.78 --> 01:26:53.02
be doing things that only you can do and if someone else can do it you're in a leadership position

995
01:26:53.02 --> 01:26:57.58
let's someone else do it and if there's no one else can do it cool then that's an indication that

996
01:26:57.58 --> 01:27:02.86
maybe you should start training someone to do that other thing that you only at this time can do

997
01:27:03.42 --> 01:27:06.30
because as long as you're the only person that can do a job that's what you're going to be doing

998
01:27:06.30 --> 01:27:12.54
that job and that's that should be your goal not to be doing the same thing forever and if you're

999
01:27:12.54 --> 01:27:16.14
doing that job that means you're looking down and in instead of being able to look up and out

1000
01:27:16.14 --> 01:27:20.62
and see what the next horizon's going to be see what the next market's going to be see where we

1001
01:27:20.62 --> 01:27:27.10
can maneuver to those are all things we need to look at um you could done with that deployment

1002
01:27:27.10 --> 01:27:31.50
and this is this one you went to the White House yeah I finished three years basically of run

1003
01:27:31.50 --> 01:27:37.42
and pretty hard as the exo so the the ops officer and then fleeted up as the exo at Sealteen

1004
01:27:37.42 --> 01:27:42.78
10 did you deploy again with the XO I did and where did you go on that oh sorry that was the

1005
01:27:42.78 --> 01:27:48.30
Iraq deployment okay got that that was that was got it so so I did two deployments one as like the

1006
01:27:48.70 --> 01:27:55.18
right out of grad school got it and then the exo's Sealteen Iraq deployment though um so come back

1007
01:27:55.18 --> 01:27:59.18
and and for for everybody listening we're really good about succession planning and the Seals

1008
01:27:59.18 --> 01:28:03.50
you know you once you're in the seat a seat for two or three years you're thinking how you have

1009
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:08.86
to get out of your seat and make room for the next guy and we do these diversity tours I was

1010
01:28:08.86 --> 01:28:13.50
fortunate my first diversity tour was you know graduate school for two years in Cambridge mass

1011
01:28:14.14 --> 01:28:18.46
and it was time for me to get out of my chair as the exo is Sealteen 10 and I applied for the White

1012
01:28:18.46 --> 01:28:26.06
House Fellowship it's a non military program it is a great leadership public service program

1013
01:28:26.06 --> 01:28:30.14
I threw you know that's a through my name and the hat it's quite an extensive application for us

1014
01:28:30.70 --> 01:28:36.70
and ultimately was picked the their thousands of applicants the nation picks 14 to be White House

1015
01:28:36.70 --> 01:28:42.22
Fellows every year and I got placed as the director for defense policy and strategy for Bush

1016
01:28:42.22 --> 01:28:46.70
so literally report to the national security adviser who reports to the president like day seven

1017
01:28:46.70 --> 01:28:51.82
I'm running my first meetings in the White House situation room it like the who is a lot of steep learning

1018
01:28:51.82 --> 01:28:56.46
walking around pretending like you know how to you're wearing a washing in DC you know I'm like you

1019
01:28:56.46 --> 01:29:01.74
know dumb team guy all of a sudden thrown in the policy world but you got speaking of

1020
01:29:01.74 --> 01:29:06.54
getting this job in the selection process you got a cool thing in here that that talks about that a

1021
01:29:06.54 --> 01:29:11.50
little bit going back to the book my interviewer sat me down and asked a bunch of questions a bunch

1022
01:29:11.50 --> 01:29:16.94
of introductory questions then stared at me with intensity and said Mike what do you know about the

1023
01:29:16.94 --> 01:29:24.06
start treaty I took a breath looked at him and said with dead pan seriousness I know how to spell it

1024
01:29:25.18 --> 01:29:30.62
honestly I didn't know anything about our nation's nuclear treaties not a bit but what I did

1025
01:29:30.62 --> 01:29:35.66
know and I told him this too was how to get the right people into a room and how to run the decision

1026
01:29:35.66 --> 01:29:42.14
making process I knew how to figure out what motivated people how to get them to generate ideas

1027
01:29:42.14 --> 01:29:48.14
how to cooperate and ultimately how to leave the room with the best possible outcome I wasn't

1028
01:29:48.14 --> 01:29:54.78
afraid to admit that I didn't know a thing about nuclear policy and I think that's what got me the job

1029
01:29:55.10 --> 01:30:00.38
being humble enough to admit that being humble enough to admit what you don't know but still

1030
01:30:00.38 --> 01:30:05.58
confident enough to explain where you can add value is a balance that's often hard to strike

1031
01:30:06.30 --> 01:30:11.58
but you need to recognize that it's a strength not a weakness to know what's beyond your knowledge

1032
01:30:11.58 --> 01:30:17.10
or understanding at any point in time instead of pretending otherwise I walk into any room and

1033
01:30:17.10 --> 01:30:22.14
always assume that people in it are smarter than I am faster than I am and more agile than I am

1034
01:30:22.14 --> 01:30:30.86
that way I can never be wrong I never assume I have the idea I have an idea maybe it's the best one

1035
01:30:30.86 --> 01:30:35.66
or maybe it's not but honestly it shouldn't even matter because our job in any room is to find

1036
01:30:35.66 --> 01:30:41.10
the best answer for the problem we're working on no matter who's answer it is we have to listen to

1037
01:30:41.10 --> 01:30:47.10
each other and really hear each other and the best way to do that is to walk into the room knowing

1038
01:30:47.10 --> 01:30:54.38
there's no doubt that everyone in there has something useful to say so that's how you ended up with

1039
01:30:54.38 --> 01:31:00.30
that job not by being this not by being the smartest guy about nuclear treaties but by saying hey

1040
01:31:00.30 --> 01:31:05.82
look I don't know everything about that but I can help make a decision it's it's exactly what you

1041
01:31:05.82 --> 01:31:10.06
talk about in extreme ownership it's it's the exact same way we've grown up in the seals and

1042
01:31:10.06 --> 01:31:16.78
just espousing that for sure so you're working at the White House so what's this job what's the

1043
01:31:16.78 --> 01:31:21.34
first job that you get when when you get there as a White House fellow what's the first job well

1044
01:31:21.34 --> 01:31:26.06
the White House Fellowship is has kind of like three legs of the stool as an active White House

1045
01:31:26.06 --> 01:31:31.34
fellow you're you're wearing a suit to work every day it's not a it's not a uniform job

1046
01:31:31.34 --> 01:31:38.54
and so the program has places you in a full-time job throughout the year and some people opt

1047
01:31:38.54 --> 01:31:44.38
into a job that's a little bit more a little bit more fellow E meaning you don't have really

1048
01:31:44.38 --> 01:31:48.38
that many obligations you're there to learn you just get to observe and I'm like you know I

1049
01:31:48.38 --> 01:31:52.94
want to really get in the mix you know so I had opportunities at department of commerce and I

1050
01:31:52.94 --> 01:31:56.94
had opportunities at National Security Council and so I thought do I go deeper in something I

1051
01:31:56.94 --> 01:32:02.38
know National Security do I go to commerce and learn something new and ultimately you can't pass up the

1052
01:32:02.38 --> 01:32:08.62
the the role where you're going to be in the West Wing and be just in the mix with the nation's

1053
01:32:08.62 --> 01:32:15.34
hardest problems and so that so so with that the Fellows also get together though a couple of times

1054
01:32:15.34 --> 01:32:21.50
a week and you listen to you know cabinet secretaries the Vice President the the President and

1055
01:32:21.50 --> 01:32:27.10
and so on and just ask them questions and you learn it's all off the record and 14 Fellows plus

1056
01:32:27.10 --> 01:32:32.06
the President or 14 Fellows plus the Vice President and it's just a tremendous program but you're

1057
01:32:32.06 --> 01:32:38.86
really if you pick a job that is a real a job with real responsibilities it's a hard year.

1058
01:32:40.70 --> 01:32:46.78
When you see the news now and I mean I guess it's just like seeing like a movie about like a military

1059
01:32:46.78 --> 01:32:50.62
movie how you and I will watch a military movie and it's like oh that would never have an oh that's

1060
01:32:50.62 --> 01:32:56.22
another thing how is it for you now you look you look at what's happening in the White House and you

1061
01:32:56.22 --> 01:33:00.94
know all these inner workings of what's going on behind the scenes what does it what it give us a

1062
01:33:00.94 --> 01:33:05.34
little glimpse of what it's like going on behind the scenes. Yeah you know I think the real thing

1063
01:33:05.34 --> 01:33:11.02
that is not sexy is process but process is what accelerates outcomes and so when you think about

1064
01:33:11.02 --> 01:33:17.26
it there are 17 acres of the White House but there are but Jillians of different decisions that

1065
01:33:17.26 --> 01:33:22.62
need to be made and so not everybody can bring their decision to the top of the house and so at my

1066
01:33:22.62 --> 01:33:29.90
level I ran a certain meeting in the in the White House situation room and it's it's simple it's a

1067
01:33:29.90 --> 01:33:37.10
binary outcome you know with it's either we agree in which case national policy is made or if not

1068
01:33:37.10 --> 01:33:42.22
then we we sus out what is what are the different stakeholders think what is the department of

1069
01:33:42.22 --> 01:33:47.42
state or department of defense or energy or the intel community think and and why can't we compromise

1070
01:33:47.42 --> 01:33:52.78
and so by definition only the harder issues are bubbling up to then a deputies committee meeting where

1071
01:33:52.78 --> 01:33:57.66
the number two runs it again binary outcome at a deputies committee meeting they either agree

1072
01:33:57.66 --> 01:34:01.98
and make policy or not and then it becomes a principles committee meeting where you have the national

1073
01:34:01.98 --> 01:34:07.18
security adviser chairing it and you've got the sec death the sec state all of the the number

1074
01:34:07.18 --> 01:34:12.62
ones of all the departments and agencies around the table again binary outcome agree or not

1075
01:34:12.62 --> 01:34:18.62
if agree great policy made if not that's going to the president and so by definition you've created

1076
01:34:18.62 --> 01:34:24.86
a system where you get volume and flow but only but only the hardest things are making it to the top

1077
01:34:24.86 --> 01:34:31.34
sometimes that runs well sometimes that doesn't run well and so as I sit back you know I think about

1078
01:34:31.34 --> 01:34:35.98
you know how are things working are they working like they can or should as soon as decisions

1079
01:34:35.98 --> 01:34:44.14
get made outside of that process you you you you actually diminish the probability of the best

1080
01:34:44.14 --> 01:34:48.70
possible decision getting made because you know as well as I do if not everybody's at the table

1081
01:34:48.70 --> 01:34:52.38
and you make a decision you've kind of alienated a bunch of stakeholders and you don't get

1082
01:34:52.38 --> 01:34:57.42
everybody rolling in the same direction so that's kind of the lens that I look at at Washington DC

1083
01:34:57.42 --> 01:35:02.86
and you know I think sometimes we're we're way more broken than we should be but other times

1084
01:35:02.86 --> 01:35:07.66
I think you know it's it's you've seen the smartest mine solve some of the really hardest problems we have

1085
01:35:07.66 --> 01:35:13.10
we have a lot to be proud of and we have a lot to work on in this in this nation so what which meeting

1086
01:35:13.10 --> 01:35:18.38
is it that you would run you said well every of all these meetings which which one where you which

1087
01:35:18.38 --> 01:35:24.30
level of meetings would you run so every administration changes the name a little bit just because

1088
01:35:24.30 --> 01:35:29.26
they need to you know put the their own stamp on on what it's called but a policy coordinating committee

1089
01:35:29.98 --> 01:35:34.86
was what it was called in the Bush administration as an example a PCC I think it was if I'm I'm

1090
01:35:34.86 --> 01:35:38.94
I didn't even be wrong on that but a three three letter acronym that was you know something that

1091
01:35:38.94 --> 01:35:43.34
changes but but but but the point is I'd be at the head of the table and you'd have basically

1092
01:35:43.34 --> 01:35:50.30
assistant secretary level people or you know roughly two three star-ish generals from the

1093
01:35:50.78 --> 01:35:54.38
from the Department of Defense you know just whoever this day called there was for the

1094
01:35:54.38 --> 01:35:59.42
particular issue some people from under secretary defense and the policy shop sitting there and

1095
01:35:59.42 --> 01:36:04.38
and look I'm not trying to glorify myself or be the president of fan club I'm a guy who ran the

1096
01:36:04.38 --> 01:36:08.46
process but the thing is that's that's the role if you can run the process really well

1097
01:36:08.46 --> 01:36:14.06
then it makes the nation run well you know and you know you know I've been often asked

1098
01:36:14.06 --> 01:36:18.30
a little bit of a segue here but you know hey as we got out of Afghanistan what went wrong

1099
01:36:18.30 --> 01:36:23.74
the thing that went wrong was policy process broke down who are we bringing home we didn't

1100
01:36:23.74 --> 01:36:27.82
have a question answer to that question and so that caused a lot of chaos and a little a lot of

1101
01:36:27.82 --> 01:36:33.10
people rush to an airport hoping to get onto a flight you know so anyways that that's just one

1102
01:36:33.10 --> 01:36:39.50
example of the how policy the the engine and the machine should work how many hours a day

1103
01:36:39.50 --> 01:36:45.42
are you working in those long hours that was you know I'd get in it you know I always get my

1104
01:36:45.42 --> 01:36:50.94
workout in the morning I honestly got there you know 737 eight clocks and like that but but it was

1105
01:36:50.94 --> 01:36:56.14
home at 10 o'clock on a lot of nights and then a lot of times you know paying attention to the

1106
01:36:56.14 --> 01:37:04.38
blackberry I'll date myself oh 708 oh nine time frame and in fact I remember very well one night

1107
01:37:04.38 --> 01:37:09.10
at three in the morning the blackberry just buzzing nonstop which usually didn't wake me up but it

1108
01:37:09.10 --> 01:37:14.94
did this night and that's where the guy captain Richard Phillips got uh got uh taken hi it was

1109
01:37:14.94 --> 01:37:21.42
hijacked on the mayor's gallabama and then I called a friend of mine Chris Demensick who was at

1110
01:37:21.42 --> 01:37:26.46
at at team six and said hey man a million layers between you and me but you gotta go start

1111
01:37:26.46 --> 01:37:31.18
looking at this right now and and you know hours later I'm in my suit in the basement of the

1112
01:37:31.18 --> 01:37:36.54
Pentagon and the NMCC the National Military Command Center and just trying to work the problem and

1113
01:37:36.54 --> 01:37:42.78
and ultimately ran that I ran that whole thing from the the national security council and

1114
01:37:42.78 --> 01:37:46.94
one of the cooler things was you know running these meetings and you know President Obama

1115
01:37:46.94 --> 01:37:50.94
would walk in and there's only about only about four or five six of us kind of running this this

1116
01:37:50.94 --> 01:37:56.14
this situation and when the whole thing was done President Obama wrote a really nice note

1117
01:37:56.14 --> 01:38:02.22
on White House Stationary Mike great job on the Somalia situation you made a family very

1118
01:38:02.22 --> 01:38:08.70
happy at Easter Baroque. Yeah that's pretty cool. Yeah you have a little little section here

1119
01:38:08.70 --> 01:38:13.66
that thought was pretty cool talking about that as this is going down you get these you get these

1120
01:38:13.66 --> 01:38:19.02
uh text or whatever the the Blackberry's buzzing you say I called the Pentagon and a one star

1121
01:38:19.02 --> 01:38:23.42
animal who is on duty told me that his guidance was not to prepare any options to deal with

1122
01:38:23.42 --> 01:38:29.74
the situation. I responded with something I said only twice in my two years in my position at the

1123
01:38:29.74 --> 01:38:36.54
National Security Council. quote Sir please take this as direction from the White House and quote

1124
01:38:37.34 --> 01:38:41.98
I told him that the Department of Defense needed to prepare military options to rescue the crew

1125
01:38:41.98 --> 01:38:46.54
and keep the pirate capers from selling Captain Phillips to Al Shabbab or another terrorist

1126
01:38:46.54 --> 01:38:52.70
organization. The only question I said to the Admiral is how fast can you have options back to

1127
01:38:52.70 --> 01:38:57.58
the National Security Council. By the afternoon my biggest worry had become real. The pirates had left

1128
01:38:57.58 --> 01:39:02.22
the ship putting the crew putting the crew out of danger but they had taken Captain Phillips with them

1129
01:39:02.22 --> 01:39:07.42
and were holding him hostage on a lifeboat heading toward shore fortunately by that point

1130
01:39:07.42 --> 01:39:11.90
the Department of Defense had done what it does best and was giving the National Security Council

1131
01:39:11.90 --> 01:39:17.90
and the President real options to address a really hard problem. My friend my friend Scott

1132
01:39:17.90 --> 01:39:22.78
commander of the entire task force being deployed for the mission and Chris a leader of the

1133
01:39:22.78 --> 01:39:27.98
tactical response itself arrived on scene halfway around the globe in a matter of hours after the

1134
01:39:27.98 --> 01:39:32.94
mission was launched they inverted a crisis on Easter Sunday as they shot three pirates with three

1135
01:39:32.94 --> 01:39:37.50
rounds in the dark and night while both their ship and the pirates lifeboat rocked up and down

1136
01:39:37.50 --> 01:39:42.94
on the swells of the open ocean. Scott Chris and their snipers were the true heroes of that day.

1137
01:39:45.10 --> 01:39:48.38
It's no different than third phase of Buds. Do you remember when we're thinking

1138
01:39:48.38 --> 01:39:51.90
we're we're we're told think about what can go wrong on your mission.

1139
01:39:52.62 --> 01:39:56.22
Yeah. Think forward what are all the things that can happen? So it's not like I was

1140
01:39:56.22 --> 01:39:59.82
anybody special in the White House. I was just doing what I grew up with and the seal teams

1141
01:39:59.82 --> 01:40:03.74
it's the same thing you or any other you know seal leader would have done which is hey this

1142
01:40:03.74 --> 01:40:07.82
can actually go bad and here's how it can go bad and we're going to prepare for the worst case not

1143
01:40:07.82 --> 01:40:12.78
the best case. Have you been to the UDTCL Museum and Fort Pierce Florida? Not lately but but I have

1144
01:40:12.78 --> 01:40:15.82
they have they have the lifeboat there. Yeah. I don't know if you know that you have to

1145
01:40:15.82 --> 01:40:21.66
welcome myself. Yeah that's pretty awesome. That's pretty awesome. Group doing pretty awesome stuff there.

1146
01:40:23.98 --> 01:40:28.38
So that's so that's this White House fellow position and you that's an interesting

1147
01:40:28.38 --> 01:40:33.34
going from George W. Bush to Barack Obama. What do you notice about those two leaders?

1148
01:40:34.86 --> 01:40:41.90
First of all great governors of people and great leaders in different ways. You know the

1149
01:40:44.14 --> 01:40:48.94
the press has a certain view and a certain lens on things and having been on the inside

1150
01:40:48.94 --> 01:40:53.26
I'll just it's really obvious statement but just don't believe everything you see you read.

1151
01:40:53.26 --> 01:40:57.58
So that was another great set of lessons that what came out of that two years in Washington DC

1152
01:40:57.58 --> 01:41:01.66
for me the White House fellowship was supposed to only be a year but after that Captain Phillips

1153
01:41:01.66 --> 01:41:05.98
thing President Obama said hey can you stay my whole administration. So I stayed at state a second

1154
01:41:05.98 --> 01:41:14.30
year and continued in my role but you know the at really at the end of the day it was about

1155
01:41:16.22 --> 01:41:21.90
about seeing an administration in year seven and a half is a lot different than an administration in

1156
01:41:21.90 --> 01:41:26.70
minute one and so people can think about oh the right and the left. For sure that can there's

1157
01:41:26.70 --> 01:41:31.50
of course policy differences not as many national security ironically once you get briefed up

1158
01:41:31.50 --> 01:41:36.86
and you're really like in the T the TSS CI top secret sensitive apartment information of like

1159
01:41:36.86 --> 01:41:42.54
what's happening in the world politics actually causes the the opinions to narrow a good bit because

1160
01:41:42.54 --> 01:41:47.66
there's only so many solutions to the national security problems but the the thing I would say is

1161
01:41:48.38 --> 01:41:55.18
setting aside right and left issues it's really an energy you know you're seeing the third or

1162
01:41:55.18 --> 01:41:58.94
fourth person in the role at year seven and a half of an administration and you're seeing somebody

1163
01:41:58.94 --> 01:42:04.14
else on minute one who's got incredible energy and they're just happy to be they're happy to be there.

1164
01:42:04.14 --> 01:42:08.22
They might not know where the lights which is are for the first few weeks but but it's um but that's

1165
01:42:08.22 --> 01:42:16.94
the beauty of the the permanent staff that that kind of works as part of the institution in DC

1166
01:42:17.50 --> 01:42:22.38
and I've always felt you know people will complain that nothing ever changes

1167
01:42:22.38 --> 01:42:28.94
well there's some positivity to things being hard to change in our government.

1168
01:42:28.94 --> 01:42:34.14
Would you say that's an accurate assessment? A 300% like I don't want the government to be at the

1169
01:42:34.14 --> 01:42:39.10
whim of whoever's in charge to just whip it one way or the other. No I think our nation's four

1170
01:42:39.10 --> 01:42:44.38
fathers made it easy to kind of bump down the the the highway but not to get off the road.

1171
01:42:46.78 --> 01:42:51.26
Awesome hard so you wrap that up and and while you're there is this when you figure out that

1172
01:42:51.26 --> 01:42:56.46
you're gonna go to a sealed team to as the CEO. It is and you know it's handling Afghanistan policy as well

1173
01:42:56.46 --> 01:43:01.50
and Scott Moore was the detailer the Scott that you just referred to in the in the previous

1174
01:43:01.50 --> 01:43:05.42
passage and he said hey Mike you're gonna you're gonna take over sealed team too can you get yourself

1175
01:43:05.42 --> 01:43:09.82
out of the White House like we can't pull you out like you're the only one who's gonna have to you know and of

1176
01:43:09.82 --> 01:43:16.62
course that after two years I was ready for my next challenge and ultimately got permission to leave and

1177
01:43:16.62 --> 01:43:22.54
I said I've got a great opportunity of and I knew I'd be deploying back to Afghanistan because

1178
01:43:23.26 --> 01:43:28.70
as you well know the naval special war for community doesn't frequently get real estate to own

1179
01:43:29.26 --> 01:43:35.10
and so we had southeast of Afghanistan and it was a great opportunity to not just take a

1180
01:43:35.10 --> 01:43:40.30
sealed team overseas but to integrate a bunch of you know green berets a bunch of you know

1181
01:43:40.30 --> 01:43:46.54
you know infantry from the army and just every single aspect of of what the what the nation's

1182
01:43:46.54 --> 01:43:53.90
Department of Defense really is. Yeah what's that what a huge what a huge step for the community

1183
01:43:53.90 --> 01:43:59.18
you know I was talking to animal Richards and and those guys that had this sort of vision that we

1184
01:43:59.18 --> 01:44:05.02
should be deploying in that in that even with the idea that we should be deploying like that like

1185
01:44:05.02 --> 01:44:11.90
as a team CEO deploying overseas like that was those guys came up with this idea and thankfully

1186
01:44:11.90 --> 01:44:16.22
they came up with it before September 11th it they kind of it wasn't there yet I mean what was

1187
01:44:16.22 --> 01:44:22.38
remember vision 2000 like that that was them trying to formulate this idea but yeah this is an

1188
01:44:22.38 --> 01:44:29.02
example of how well that actually worked the opportunities that we're there. Yeah so so awesome

1189
01:44:29.02 --> 01:44:33.02
and so exciting as a commander of a sealed team to be able to bring your whole team overseas to one

1190
01:44:33.02 --> 01:44:38.94
to one effort and to make a meaningful impact. Yeah I mean for just so everybody knows for

1191
01:44:39.90 --> 01:44:44.86
pretty much for the entire history the sealed teams it was going to be one season two z's

1192
01:44:44.86 --> 01:44:50.62
a platoon going here maybe a couple platoon's going there and that was what they did in Vietnam it was

1193
01:44:50.62 --> 01:44:56.06
like one or two platoons at a time deploying the sealed team commander was pack and coronado or back

1194
01:44:56.06 --> 01:45:02.06
in Virginia Beach and they were just kind of watching and and then to have this idea that actually a

1195
01:45:02.06 --> 01:45:07.26
sealed team the whole team should be able to deploy and then the team should be able to take on

1196
01:45:07.26 --> 01:45:12.62
other assets and utilize those assets I mean it's we got to be very thankful for those senior

1197
01:45:12.62 --> 01:45:17.74
leaders that came up with that plan for sure totally agree and I would say that you were you

1198
01:45:17.74 --> 01:45:24.78
were definitely a benefactor of those things couldn't be couldn't be more accurate so so appreciative.

1199
01:45:24.78 --> 01:45:28.94
So you show up at a team what was your attitude coming back to the team? Oh fired up man to

1200
01:45:28.94 --> 01:45:34.38
like get out of the White House and we're in a suit every day for two years I was ready for some sand and

1201
01:45:34.38 --> 01:45:41.90
in surf zone. You show up and the work up anything particular that you guys focused on during the

1202
01:45:41.90 --> 01:45:46.38
work up. Well you know we of course knowing it's a real benefit to also know you're

1203
01:45:46.38 --> 01:45:51.82
really preparing for Afghanistan and you get to not prepare for a bunch of different things and

1204
01:45:51.82 --> 01:45:56.22
so we minimize you know hate to say this but we minimize diving we had to make hard decisions like

1205
01:45:56.22 --> 01:45:59.90
we're not going to be diving in Afghanistan let's not go spend three weeks diving it just doesn't

1206
01:45:59.90 --> 01:46:05.18
make sense and and yes it kind of moved us away from our roots a little bit but that was that was

1207
01:46:05.98 --> 01:46:11.74
that's what commanders do is you make the those types of decisions and so for me I was really moved

1208
01:46:11.74 --> 01:46:17.42
when I went overseas I went to Afghanistan to spend a couple weeks out in theater early on in command

1209
01:46:18.06 --> 01:46:24.38
and you know I was there when we lost three seals in a helicopter crash out in Zabl province

1210
01:46:24.38 --> 01:46:32.30
and of course terrible terrible incident you know being there really left of serious mark on me

1211
01:46:32.30 --> 01:46:36.38
I mean of course you know I'd been exposed to everything already in my career but when you really

1212
01:46:36.78 --> 01:46:43.42
feel that you feel that you are the owner of the risk of the whole team it's a different feeling

1213
01:46:43.42 --> 01:46:48.06
there's a I used to think when I was second in charge of a seal team that it wouldn't really be

1214
01:46:48.06 --> 01:46:55.74
that different to be overall in charge I couldn't have been more wrong so when I when a senior leadership

1215
01:46:55.74 --> 01:47:03.10
team from from seal team to did our advanced reconnaissance if you will we came home on a

1216
01:47:03.10 --> 01:47:10.62
meta-vac where I'll never forget there was a young man who was blown up in an IED who was really

1217
01:47:10.62 --> 01:47:15.42
just being flown to Germany just so he could pass away in Germany next to his wife he was in a coma

1218
01:47:15.42 --> 01:47:20.46
and I'll never forget like a you know six or eight hour flight just spending it next to this whole

1219
01:47:20.46 --> 01:47:25.66
guy just my hand on him talking to him and just some army trooper who I don't even don't even know

1220
01:47:25.66 --> 01:47:31.58
his name but like when you're really around that I got back to the states and I I already worked hard

1221
01:47:31.58 --> 01:47:38.70
but I worked like it really stepped up the like this is real like I will bring all my guys home

1222
01:47:38.70 --> 01:47:52.06
and and and we'll do everything we can yeah those we we experience that going getting to

1223
01:47:52.06 --> 01:47:56.54
a body like as soon as we get there there's there's soldiers and Marines get killed just about

1224
01:47:56.54 --> 01:48:01.42
every day and and we would go to those services whenever we could but it was out of the gate we were

1225
01:48:01.42 --> 01:48:08.78
hating two three services in a row and it's a wake up called everybody to the recognition of

1226
01:48:09.34 --> 01:48:13.82
what's going on out in that battlefield every single day which which you know you could hear it going

1227
01:48:13.82 --> 01:48:17.66
on you could see it going on you could see vehicles you could see guys getting cows are backed out

1228
01:48:18.38 --> 01:48:25.18
we were given blood whenever we could get blood like just that heavy reality of going to these scenarios

1229
01:48:25.18 --> 01:48:36.94
um you guys you guys finish your work up you go on that that pre-depollement and now you got your

1230
01:48:36.94 --> 01:48:41.26
platoon your your team over there your whole team never mind just the platoon now you got the whole

1231
01:48:41.26 --> 01:48:47.90
team and it's not just your team that's you got SF guys you've got you've got an entire like force here

1232
01:48:48.46 --> 01:48:53.90
it sounds like from the book you you had a little bit of a rough relationship with the conventional

1233
01:48:53.90 --> 01:49:00.78
commander that was there initially with the one who was right next to me in Terran Coutt this guy just

1234
01:49:00.78 --> 01:49:06.14
didn't want to get out and put his force at risk to go do great things and you know as well as I do

1235
01:49:06.14 --> 01:49:13.34
you just you just don't respect people that don't want to do their job so uh that being said

1236
01:49:14.62 --> 01:49:19.82
your your determined and you're gonna go make things happen you got some you got your you got your

1237
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:31.42
pltunes your teams your forces still out there still getting after it but you got to know when it's

1238
01:49:31.42 --> 01:49:37.10
time to not get after it got to know when it's time to push back you got a thing here that's a

1239
01:49:37.10 --> 01:49:41.26
really good lesson and it's a really good lesson and you do this in the book you counter it to the time

1240
01:49:41.26 --> 01:49:48.78
with when the major told you in Kosovo was a Kosovo to stay out in the field and you go you know

1241
01:49:48.78 --> 01:49:53.18
what we're just gonna stay out in the field like you told us you know well that that seems like the

1242
01:49:53.18 --> 01:49:58.46
right call right now there's a little bit different here um going to the book to ensure civilian

1243
01:49:58.46 --> 01:50:04.22
casualties where's limited is possible and that the innocent afghan civilians wouldn't turn against

1244
01:50:04.22 --> 01:50:10.46
our forces the military set up a policy called boots on the ground battled damage assessment

1245
01:50:11.02 --> 01:50:18.06
this meant that after every bomb we dropped we were we were required to physically go to the site

1246
01:50:18.06 --> 01:50:24.14
to confirm that no civilians had been killed the theory a smart theory was that knowing we would have

1247
01:50:24.14 --> 01:50:29.42
to acknowledge civilian casualties would make it less likely that there would be any civilian

1248
01:50:29.42 --> 01:50:35.90
casualties a talented team of army green berets within my command had intelligence at one point

1249
01:50:35.90 --> 01:50:41.26
that there were approximately 10 Taliban members gathered together at three in the morning

1250
01:50:41.26 --> 01:50:47.58
in an area no civilian would ever go and certainly not at that time the team used

1251
01:50:47.58 --> 01:50:53.42
surveillance techniques to view the site and we knew as a certainty that there were no civilians there

1252
01:50:54.30 --> 01:50:59.82
they asked me for permission to drop a bomb from an unmanned aircraft and following the decision

1253
01:50:59.82 --> 01:51:06.46
making process I'd put in place I granted it they went ahead and eight of the Taliban fighters

1254
01:51:06.46 --> 01:51:12.30
were killed an army colonel from the commanding general staff in afghanistan called and asked

1255
01:51:12.30 --> 01:51:18.54
my watch officer for our BDA report and my watch officer explained that we didn't have one that it

1256
01:51:18.54 --> 01:51:25.42
was simply too much risk for not a good enough reason the road to the site was too dangerous to travel

1257
01:51:25.42 --> 01:51:31.10
and we knew there were no civilians present and to ask anyone on my team to go down this isolated

1258
01:51:31.10 --> 01:51:37.50
path in the middle of the night was an unnecessary risk to their lives and one it made no sense to take

1259
01:51:37.50 --> 01:51:44.62
I got on the phone with the carnal and we went back and forth this is the policy but the policy

1260
01:51:44.62 --> 01:51:50.14
in this case makes no sense to achieve an already known outcome I will not take unnecessary risk

1261
01:51:50.14 --> 01:51:55.98
that my men will die there are consequences in the military for not following the orders of a

1262
01:51:55.98 --> 01:52:02.22
superior truth is the lack of organizational flexibility is a huge problem for the military on the

1263
01:52:02.22 --> 01:52:07.90
ground we were living a never agile enough kind of life but in terms of the larger hierarchy the

1264
01:52:07.90 --> 01:52:13.18
structure had its weaknesses I could have been fired and sent home from the appointment as an

1265
01:52:13.18 --> 01:52:20.38
in subordinate but in that moment I couldn't I couldn't just blindly follow the policy I had to

1266
01:52:20.38 --> 01:52:26.38
act consistently with my values and make a judgment and subsequent decision that I was going to be

1267
01:52:26.38 --> 01:52:33.26
able to live with if the worst happened the carnal said that since I wouldn't comply he was going

1268
01:52:33.26 --> 01:52:38.78
to report my noncompliance to his boss the commanding general in Afghanistan and that he would

1269
01:52:38.78 --> 01:52:45.66
ask his peer in charge of our Afghan partner force to order his men to unilaterally inspect the site

1270
01:52:45.66 --> 01:52:53.26
instead I urged him not to do that but that decision was out of my hands 12 Afghan soldiers drove

1271
01:52:53.26 --> 01:52:59.58
down that isolated road in three vehicles to make their assessment of the bomb site the first two

1272
01:52:59.58 --> 01:53:05.74
trucks hit an IED and three V8 people in those two vehicles were killed with others seriously wounded

1273
01:53:06.86 --> 01:53:11.98
soon after I flew by helicopter to the outstation where the green beret turned team was stationed

1274
01:53:11.98 --> 01:53:17.26
sat with them and told them how incredibly proud I was of their amazing bravery their remarkable

1275
01:53:17.26 --> 01:53:22.38
work they did night after danger snite it was one of the more emotional moments in my life

1276
01:53:22.38 --> 01:53:26.94
as we started our meeting silence fell over the room and one of the guys on the team opened

1277
01:53:26.94 --> 01:53:32.78
by looking me square in the eyes and quietly but resolutely thanking me he knew that the

1278
01:53:32.78 --> 01:53:37.66
easier decision would have been caving to the pressure from above and deviating from my beliefs

1279
01:53:38.22 --> 01:53:42.54
and we all knew that would have meant some of the men in this room would have died

1280
01:53:43.58 --> 01:53:48.86
the green beret had no idea that his words made my throat almost closed as I choked up

1281
01:53:48.86 --> 01:53:55.34
and how hard I had to fight off tears I was simply overwhelmed by the real life impact by the

1282
01:53:55.34 --> 01:54:00.30
reality of the situation the overwhelming magnitude of these kind of decisions made under the

1283
01:54:00.30 --> 01:54:06.06
pressure of intense nightly combat take a toll on people that's difficult to understand for those

1284
01:54:06.06 --> 01:54:11.42
who haven't experienced it now with the benefit of several years of hindsight and the time

1285
01:54:11.42 --> 01:54:16.78
to fully reflect on those past events I haven't even even greater belief in the importance of

1286
01:54:16.78 --> 01:54:25.26
process your own process and a values based decision making process can no exaggeration save

1287
01:54:25.26 --> 01:54:42.22
people's lives yeah um a point I like to bring up in situations like this is if you're in a

1288
01:54:42.22 --> 01:54:49.58
leadership position and someone below you in the chain of command is refusing to do something

1289
01:54:49.58 --> 01:54:57.34
or pushing back that hard you should probably listen to them and this is a situation I mean

1290
01:54:57.34 --> 01:55:04.06
when as I was reading this as soon as I saw you know it go to oh he's gonna order someone else

1291
01:55:04.06 --> 01:55:08.46
to address those I already knew the outcome because I know you're not pushing back

1292
01:55:08.46 --> 01:55:17.10
for no reason you're pushing back for good reason it might be hard for people to understand

1293
01:55:17.10 --> 01:55:21.90
that kind of pressure that you're under to kind of concede and just go with what you're being told

1294
01:55:21.90 --> 01:55:26.86
to do there's times in life you gotta just put it on the table and say be ready for the

1295
01:55:26.86 --> 01:55:33.26
outcome be ready to be fired you always hear pick your battles this was unquestionably one of them

1296
01:55:33.26 --> 01:55:39.34
and this is why you are in command and this is why that's is everything that you've trained to do

1297
01:55:39.34 --> 01:55:44.86
at that point in life is for that it's for a moment like that it's to have confidence in yourself

1298
01:55:44.86 --> 01:55:49.66
that you're that you're right and to not take that unnecessary risk I still get you know emotional

1299
01:55:49.66 --> 01:55:57.50
as you were reading it I haven't you know I you know I sit back and I can very tactily feel

1300
01:55:57.50 --> 01:56:03.98
sitting in that room in the silence and me looking at all these guys and really knowing that

1301
01:56:03.98 --> 01:56:09.50
that me having the backbone saved you know several of their lives and not not be able to look at

1302
01:56:09.50 --> 01:56:15.26
which guy wasn't there or which guy you know it would have been but it's just the weight of combat

1303
01:56:15.26 --> 01:56:20.70
gets really hard over time and and there's certain moments like that where you just say to yourself

1304
01:56:20.70 --> 01:56:31.10
this shit is real how long was this deployment that was ten months that's a long deployment

1305
01:56:31.10 --> 01:56:36.14
for seals it is what was there was was were we correcting a deployment cycle or something like that

1306
01:56:36.14 --> 01:56:40.22
was it one of those things what happened we were just trying to stretch our forces more get more out of

1307
01:56:40.22 --> 01:56:45.58
the forces we had so lengthen it out a bit and and then you could put more people on the battlefield

1308
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:52.62
and that it was not more complicated than that sometimes NSW's had to kind of make adjustments

1309
01:56:52.62 --> 01:56:57.82
and extend someone and cut someone else short but it wasn't that hard we're just trying to

1310
01:56:57.82 --> 01:57:04.06
know it was it was a line with the you know there were a line with the command leadership structure

1311
01:57:04.06 --> 01:57:09.50
for the joint special operations task force throughout Afghanistan there were you know five

1312
01:57:09.50 --> 01:57:14.22
different regions if you will so I was southeast but there was also you know obviously south and west

1313
01:57:14.22 --> 01:57:20.54
and that was the cycle that the that the special operations community was on and so if the

1314
01:57:20.54 --> 01:57:25.10
seals wanted to you know play the game and have the the battle space you just had to

1315
01:57:25.10 --> 01:57:29.90
acquiesce and do the ten months you can't get off cycle with the rest of the rest of the force but

1316
01:57:29.90 --> 01:57:38.78
yeah decisions like that very frequently and literally life and death what was your kind of

1317
01:57:38.78 --> 01:57:44.06
battle rhythm your your personal battle rhythm during that deployment like what what time are you

1318
01:57:44.06 --> 01:57:48.22
going to sleep what time are you waking up is there any rhythm jaco i had no rhythm you know i had

1319
01:57:48.22 --> 01:57:53.50
a red light my ceiling that was anytime there was it was a tick troops in contact you know my

1320
01:57:53.50 --> 01:57:59.58
my bedroom was about a thirty yard sprint down this like you know plywood palace kind of hallway

1321
01:57:59.58 --> 01:58:06.38
to get to the the the the the the the operation center the the the antithesis of the the

1322
01:58:06.38 --> 01:58:10.30
talking a rucksack that you talk about at the beginning you know we had the we had the plasma

1323
01:58:10.30 --> 01:58:14.86
TVs and the terrain mapping and the unmanned aerial vehicle feeds and everything and and you know

1324
01:58:14.86 --> 01:58:20.54
you you would just get the the the calls that you know you you hear the the crazy machine gun

1325
01:58:20.54 --> 01:58:25.18
fire coming in over the over the satellite radio and you hear one of your your key leaders whose

1326
01:58:25.18 --> 01:58:29.42
voices you know immediately even though they're not saying their name on the on the on the sat calm radio

1327
01:58:29.42 --> 01:58:35.10
and they're just calmly saying what they need it's a it's a I need a 500 pound jdm drop like yesterday

1328
01:58:35.10 --> 01:58:41.82
on this particular location and and and I was the one to make the decisions on when we drop

1329
01:58:41.82 --> 01:58:46.14
bombs and when we didn't and when operations we went on what we didn't and so because I had I don't

1330
01:58:46.14 --> 01:58:50.94
know is roughly 25 different outstations throughout the southeast and sometimes literally I think

1331
01:58:50.94 --> 01:58:57.10
the five six seven different elements in a ticket a time I was I was just I was just on

1332
01:58:57.98 --> 01:59:02.46
did you were you the approval for yeah I was the approval for air yeah

1333
01:59:02.46 --> 01:59:08.94
yeah so you're busy yeah I mean we I don't know I don't think I've ever said this number

1334
01:59:08.94 --> 01:59:15.82
publicly but it's it's not you know a secret but we had over 1100 air to ground drops over 10

1335
01:59:15.82 --> 01:59:19.90
months and I'm in proud to say we didn't harm anybody we shouldn't harm there were times that we

1336
01:59:19.90 --> 01:59:25.02
that we said no it wasn't a lot but but you know the mostly the leadership in the field new

1337
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:29.58
when not to ask for something but occasionally there were times it came up when when I said no and

1338
01:59:29.58 --> 01:59:34.46
I just wasn't comfortable with something and so the the other thing that's interesting when

1339
01:59:34.46 --> 01:59:38.22
you ask about the battle rhythm though is that it was also important to me to go out on some

1340
01:59:38.22 --> 01:59:42.86
of the operations with the guys and I didn't go out quite as frequently as I did in Iraq but I

1341
01:59:42.86 --> 01:59:47.02
still got out maybe once a week or something like that and I didn't do that in the beginning of

1342
01:59:47.02 --> 01:59:52.46
the deployment because I wanted is the the staff to kind of see the the judgment the decision making

1343
01:59:52.46 --> 01:59:59.50
etc but I did an incredible excel rocky Russell and who I would super supreme confidence in so I

1344
01:59:59.50 --> 02:00:04.78
I'd go out on an operation and be with the the the Afghan commandos in a seal platoon for I don't know

1345
02:00:04.78 --> 02:00:09.74
a day and a half two days at times and that's a that's a tough decision also because as soon as you

1346
02:00:09.74 --> 02:00:15.10
swing and go on one operation with one unit dude you don't know what's happening with the other 24

1347
02:00:16.46 --> 02:00:20.46
so that takes an element of like confidence and trust but of course as you know it makes you a

1348
02:00:20.46 --> 02:00:24.94
better leader because it helps you understand and maintain perspective and frankly just to share

1349
02:00:24.94 --> 02:00:30.78
the same risk as the guys you know and and as of whatever I'm 51 now is a 41-ish year old

1350
02:00:30.78 --> 02:00:37.82
seal team commander you know that deployment we got shot at and rocketed and the the I cut one of

1351
02:00:37.82 --> 02:00:45.02
my guys legs off on that deployment and just wanted to have this. There was somebody in an IED who

1352
02:00:45.02 --> 02:00:52.86
was blown up and we had a mass casualty situation and so you know it was it was we had you know doctors

1353
02:00:52.86 --> 02:00:56.54
but they were busy and you know I was kind of under it wasn't like I did it on my own the doctor

1354
02:00:56.54 --> 02:01:01.34
kind of said hey okay do this do this do this and cut this and you know go and and because it was a

1355
02:01:01.34 --> 02:01:07.34
it was an all hands on deck kind of thing in the in our in our in our headquarters at the

1356
02:01:08.94 --> 02:01:14.62
it was kind of like the mass unit if you will you know oh so you had you had casualties come into your

1357
02:01:14.62 --> 02:01:21.66
location yep and it was a mass casualty yeah it was yeah and so you were there freaking they were like

1358
02:01:21.66 --> 02:01:27.10
scrubbed up getting it getting it on I don't even think we scrubbed it I mean we you know we we did

1359
02:01:27.10 --> 02:01:32.94
it I don't remember perfectly but I just remember we didn't I met this guy at the helicopter who

1360
02:01:32.94 --> 02:01:38.46
had three turnicots on and one of them was had come loose and yet arterial bleeding coming from

1361
02:01:38.46 --> 02:01:43.90
the middle of his leg that was missing and I had to you know reach in and hold pressure on arterial

1362
02:01:43.90 --> 02:01:47.98
bleeder and take him from the helicopter and get him all the way into the get him all the way into

1363
02:01:47.98 --> 02:01:53.58
the medical unit and there was another guy who was I mean blown up beyond recognition but I mean

1364
02:01:53.58 --> 02:01:59.26
I knew who was of course but I mean it was just it was really really bad and and then it was just

1365
02:01:59.26 --> 02:02:05.26
there were only a handful of seals in the in the the headquarters at the moment and you know

1366
02:02:05.26 --> 02:02:10.22
the the tick was gone and so it was that was taken care of and so it was just all hands on deck

1367
02:02:10.22 --> 02:02:14.30
and dealing with the medical situation and that was one night but there were several nights where

1368
02:02:14.30 --> 02:02:20.46
we had overwhelming number of of people who were shot up or blown up that we were taking care of

1369
02:02:23.58 --> 02:02:28.06
but somehow from your seal team from seal team too you guys made it through that deployment

1370
02:02:28.06 --> 02:02:31.42
without losing anyone no one was killed in action yeah

1371
02:02:31.42 --> 02:02:43.26
any other any other thing to wrap up on that deployment I think it's really the main it really is

1372
02:02:43.26 --> 02:02:55.58
the inexplicable pace and and dedication that our entire entire department of defense has

1373
02:02:55.58 --> 02:03:01.82
is is really remarkable you know it's you just get humbled every day to see how hard people

1374
02:03:01.82 --> 02:03:08.54
work in the u.s. your conditions and you know both seals and green braise and and non-seals

1375
02:03:08.54 --> 02:03:14.62
and non-green braise out in these hinterlands literally just not showering for months on and

1376
02:03:14.62 --> 02:03:20.46
only eating the food that helicopters drop into them and just really putting country and others

1377
02:03:20.46 --> 02:03:27.18
before self I just was constantly humbled to to be part of an organization with such great

1378
02:03:27.18 --> 02:03:40.54
great Americans so you get home from that deployment and I'm gonna go to the book here

1379
02:03:41.58 --> 02:03:47.18
I'd been home from Afghanistan just for just a few weeks when I found out that my replacement

1380
02:03:47.18 --> 02:03:53.26
as commander of the special operations task force who had taken over my team

1381
02:03:54.46 --> 02:03:59.98
finished when my team finished its deployment had decided to take his own life shooting himself

1382
02:03:59.98 --> 02:04:04.30
with his pistol in his room in the bed I had slept in for the previous 10 months

1383
02:04:06.70 --> 02:04:13.74
I was shocked and devastated he and I were good friends former roommates but classmates 20 years earlier

1384
02:04:13.74 --> 02:04:20.30
we had come up the ranks together before we each got married and started our families we shared a

1385
02:04:20.30 --> 02:04:27.50
house in Virginia Beach for three years we were inseparable in those days we had bonded over

1386
02:04:27.50 --> 02:04:33.42
our mutual frustration at the pull-up bar during buds training one Saturday morning after we both failed

1387
02:04:33.42 --> 02:04:39.58
the day before to come him anywhere close to matching the 15 to 20 pull-ups our fellow trainees were

1388
02:04:39.58 --> 02:04:44.30
able to do we decided to go find a pull-up bar to practice on far away from the buds compound

1389
02:04:44.30 --> 02:04:48.94
we're no one would stumble upon us despite a full night's sleep we were still struggling

1390
02:04:48.94 --> 02:04:54.78
as we fought as we each fought through our fourth pull-up I can still see his face and here the

1391
02:04:54.78 --> 02:05:01.34
chuckle in his voice as he turned to me and said world's finest right here he was loyal

1392
02:05:01.34 --> 02:05:07.98
genuine a man who could find humor in absolutely anything another time in training we were so

1393
02:05:07.98 --> 02:05:12.70
cold on a boat ride back to the compound after an icy swim that we found ourselves fighting

1394
02:05:12.70 --> 02:05:19.26
over where to place one rubber fin that was shielding very small parts of us from the 49 winds

1395
02:05:19.98 --> 02:05:27.66
there we were two grown adults seal trainees fighting over a tiny rubber fin to help make us a tiny bit

1396
02:05:27.66 --> 02:05:33.98
warmer and we and just a little drop less miserable we stopped for a moment and realized what we

1397
02:05:33.98 --> 02:05:40.30
were fighting over and we both just broke out in hysterical laughter it seemed like we were always laughing

1398
02:05:40.30 --> 02:05:46.22
back then when I was deployed he would check in on my family and when he was deployed I would check

1399
02:05:46.22 --> 02:05:52.86
in on his I would say that I trusted him with my life except that it was so much more than that

1400
02:05:52.86 --> 02:05:58.06
as seals we have no choice but to trust everyone on our team with our life every minute of

1401
02:05:58.06 --> 02:06:04.14
every day on the battlefield but when you bond with someone it's not so much about trusting them

1402
02:06:04.14 --> 02:06:09.02
with your life it's about wanting them to be there in the trenches with you feeling better

1403
02:06:09.02 --> 02:06:15.10
because you know they're right alongside you he was so much more than a fellow seal he was a friend

1404
02:06:15.10 --> 02:06:30.62
a teammate a brother a shiny example of the bravery a human being can exhibit

1405
02:06:30.62 --> 02:06:52.70
you know you talk about the pressure and the pace and the battle rhythm or lack of rhythm

1406
02:06:52.70 --> 02:07:02.46
and the lives it's stake and it's it's it's hard to describe what that feels like

1407
02:07:06.46 --> 02:07:11.42
and it's hard to it's hard to describe what it feels like I guess it's all I can say

1408
02:07:13.34 --> 02:07:17.02
but man this was this was just a travesty and a shock

1409
02:07:17.02 --> 02:07:26.38
to have the the commander on the ground who would just take in your place someone you grew up

1410
02:07:26.38 --> 02:07:31.82
within the team somebody I was at team two with I mean just freaking good good mug

1411
02:07:31.82 --> 02:07:48.70
it's it's so hard to understand yeah this one hurt they all hurt some of them hit closer to home

1412
02:07:48.70 --> 02:07:53.82
than others you know as I know you've experienced too and you know this is this is the

1413
02:07:54.46 --> 02:07:59.90
thing I was talking about and not describing well enough before but it's the

1414
02:07:59.90 --> 02:08:09.50
it's the weight that people carry it's the it's the not not always knowing the weight that

1415
02:08:09.50 --> 02:08:18.30
people carry and yeah this that was a tough one for me you talk a little bit in the book

1416
02:08:20.70 --> 02:08:25.34
you know I mean obviously we all have the we all go through the you know what could I have

1417
02:08:25.34 --> 02:08:29.02
done differently maybe I could have said this or seen that or done this or done that

1418
02:08:31.26 --> 02:08:37.98
is there anything as you look back is there any pattern did you have any indication

1419
02:08:37.98 --> 02:08:43.42
I mean you did a turnover I was looking um I was looking at there's an article in the New York

1420
02:08:43.42 --> 02:08:47.98
times about this and there's a there's a there's a situation that you describe in the book where

1421
02:08:48.54 --> 02:08:55.18
I guess the local afghans had gifted you some kind of a you know ceremonial head garment

1422
02:08:55.18 --> 02:09:00.78
of some kind and he was with you and they kind of ceremonially gave him as well the same thing and

1423
02:09:01.50 --> 02:09:05.18
and it's it's it's I don't know if you've seen this I'm sure you have but there's so you

1424
02:09:05.18 --> 02:09:10.06
write about that in the book and there's a picture in the New York Times of of you in that there's

1425
02:09:10.06 --> 02:09:15.34
the picture of when that happened and it for me was very tough to look at because I read it and I kind

1426
02:09:15.34 --> 02:09:20.38
of imagined it and you know then then then I then I go on the New York Times I'm reading this article

1427
02:09:20.38 --> 02:09:26.46
and I think oh there's the picture there's exactly what Mike was talking about um is there anything

1428
02:09:26.46 --> 02:09:32.30
that you look at that you think we need to do a better job of looking out out for?

1429
02:09:33.50 --> 02:09:38.78
Yeah well I mean let's start that with me right I think that you know we've grown up saying

1430
02:09:39.82 --> 02:09:45.34
look we can always go blame the world at everything but guys like you and me grow up starting with

1431
02:09:45.34 --> 02:09:50.22
ourselves and say what could I have done better and so when I look back at at this particular

1432
02:09:50.22 --> 02:09:55.90
situation I've recalled very vividly on a Friday afternoon to a clock in the afternoon or so at a

1433
02:09:55.90 --> 02:10:01.42
team picking up the red line and trying to dial him and just check on him and see how he's doing

1434
02:10:02.06 --> 02:10:06.06
and there was a new policy where you needed a four digit pin or something like that and I was like

1435
02:10:06.06 --> 02:10:09.66
oh the convict guys have already gone home I'm not going to bug them on a Friday afternoon and

1436
02:10:09.66 --> 02:10:15.66
make them make my phone work I'll just call call overseas on Monday. Well that Saturday is when

1437
02:10:15.66 --> 02:10:21.02
when he took his own life and I sometimes look back and say you know did I did I did I do enough and I

1438
02:10:22.14 --> 02:10:28.46
certainly wrestle with that and it leads me to a lesson that I talk about which is

1439
02:10:29.82 --> 02:10:35.58
not seeing intrusive as a bad thing you know it's it's a good thing to be intrusive in people's lives

1440
02:10:35.98 --> 02:10:41.42
and to ask the question of like hey really how are you really doing have you ever considered

1441
02:10:41.42 --> 02:10:46.62
harm to self is a hard question to ask and it's a little bit embarrassing sometimes to ask it

1442
02:10:47.18 --> 02:10:54.54
but I'll take 99 embarrassing for the one yes I miss that here and I won't miss that again and since then

1443
02:10:54.54 --> 02:11:00.62
since that happened I've had plenty of yeses where I've been able to to step in and it helped

1444
02:11:01.74 --> 02:11:08.46
I certainly wish I could have helped more in the past. When you guys are doing a turnover the turnover

1445
02:11:08.46 --> 02:11:13.58
I mean just to to so I really understand this is like just the commander of the team. It's the

1446
02:11:13.58 --> 02:11:19.50
commander of team but also the turnover this is for a lack of a better word this is like the most intimate

1447
02:11:20.46 --> 02:11:24.86
intellectual exchange you're gonna have with another human being in your life hey I've been on the ground

1448
02:11:25.58 --> 02:11:33.82
I've been fighting these troops we've been at war I'm gonna give you everything I can to help you do the

1449
02:11:33.82 --> 02:11:40.86
job I mean this is as close as you're gonna intellectually transfer information between two people

1450
02:11:40.86 --> 02:11:48.94
and then plus on top of that you guys are brothers from buds and I mean as you're doing this is it is there

1451
02:11:48.94 --> 02:11:54.86
any there's nothing there's no you know Jaco have never said this publicly the there's just one

1452
02:11:54.86 --> 02:11:59.58
shred of little thing when I play back in my mind you know we didn't lose any Americans and in my last

1453
02:11:59.58 --> 02:12:09.18
you know session with the leadership I celebrated that but the incoming team was also there and

1454
02:12:09.18 --> 02:12:14.22
my friend you know pulled me aside afterwards and said hey that was you know really rough for us to

1455
02:12:14.22 --> 02:12:21.82
set the bar to expect that we're not gonna lose anybody and and it turns out that that the leader

1456
02:12:21.82 --> 02:12:28.06
from the East Coast seal teams had also pulled my friend aside and said hey listen just do the same

1457
02:12:28.06 --> 02:12:33.50
thing Mike did just bring everybody home and and he had lost four guys in his first month and so I think that

1458
02:12:33.50 --> 02:12:40.86
pressure of losing people and you know it's it's it just it didn't it didn't add up so I mean I don't say

1459
02:12:40.86 --> 02:12:46.06
that's the cause but it's certainly unquestionably a contributor.

1460
02:12:48.94 --> 02:12:55.26
Yeah yeah I actually remember turning over with the guys that took over for us in a

1461
02:12:55.26 --> 02:13:00.22
modding I told them well because I had lost guys and I'm like it was a whole I remember thinking

1462
02:13:00.22 --> 02:13:06.62
myself am I gonna say this yes I am you guys are gonna take casualties like you there's a 100

1463
02:13:06.62 --> 02:13:10.54
percent chance you're gonna take casualties there's a 100 percent certainty that you're gonna take

1464
02:13:10.54 --> 02:13:18.14
casualties and I mean I've talked to guys since then that were in that group then that task

1465
02:13:18.14 --> 02:13:23.66
unit that relieved us and they were like that was the wake up call for them was holy shit like

1466
02:13:23.66 --> 02:13:28.22
we got our we got the seal team commander of the task unit telling us we are a 100 percent

1467
02:13:28.22 --> 02:13:38.78
certain gonna take casualties yeah but all you can do is look at wake up calls as fuel for

1468
02:13:38.78 --> 02:13:42.86
improvement in the future yeah right and and that's how we you know both of us live our lives

1469
02:13:42.86 --> 02:13:47.18
this way now is we do carry inexplicable weight and it's we're just here to make everybody

1470
02:13:47.18 --> 02:13:52.30
else's lives better and and and what do we how do we make the the families who've

1471
02:13:52.30 --> 02:13:58.22
born the cost lighter and better and how do we help the nation better learning from the things

1472
02:13:58.22 --> 02:14:04.62
that we've learned you want one of the really heartbreaking things in the book that you write

1473
02:14:04.62 --> 02:14:12.30
about was you're you're going to I guess were you part of the k-co team no I was home um you know

1474
02:14:12.30 --> 02:14:17.34
on post-applement leave but but in in Virginia Beach and so being such a family friend we were we were

1475
02:14:17.34 --> 02:14:22.14
of course you know we were one of some of the few in the house yeah and you're talking about

1476
02:14:22.14 --> 02:14:28.30
on your way to let you know his wife and his family know what had happened you you you you

1477
02:14:28.30 --> 02:14:33.98
call this a child psychologist and you you asked uh you said do we tell his daughter now the truth

1478
02:14:33.98 --> 02:14:37.66
of what happened or do we wait until she's older so she can better understand it and the

1479
02:14:37.66 --> 02:14:45.82
psychologist says you have no choice but to tell the truth now tough stuff I mean I'll never

1480
02:14:45.82 --> 02:14:52.78
forget being in the house with my wife and daughter and I mean this merits a super quick story it's

1481
02:14:52.78 --> 02:14:57.50
you know when I was overseas of course their family was checking on my wife and daughter and

1482
02:14:58.14 --> 02:15:04.94
one of the things before I came home it was that my daughter made uh deployment box that had

1483
02:15:04.94 --> 02:15:12.54
10 months worth of note cards written out to her friend my my friends daughter and they said things like

1484
02:15:12.54 --> 02:15:17.02
when you miss your dad going to his closet take out a shirt of his put it on and pretend it's a hug

1485
02:15:18.06 --> 02:15:22.70
you know notes like that they say here's how you're gonna get through the deployment and so then

1486
02:15:22.70 --> 02:15:28.06
you know just a month later or so me being there and seeing the deployment box that she had

1487
02:15:28.06 --> 02:15:32.54
told me about which neither my wife nor I gave her the direction to go do that that was her

1488
02:15:32.54 --> 02:15:37.26
entirely on her own and um sometimes you know the the the the kids and the wives and the spouses

1489
02:15:37.26 --> 02:15:43.58
never get enough credit for for as strong as they are but being in that room and I'll still never

1490
02:15:43.58 --> 02:15:49.10
forget her screams you know he said he'd come home and and then more importantly like my daughter

1491
02:15:49.10 --> 02:15:54.30
being there and and consoling her friend who had just lost her dad it's these are these are

1492
02:15:54.30 --> 02:15:58.86
weighty things man make sure you grow up fast

1493
02:15:58.86 --> 02:16:06.54
how much longer after that did you decide you're gonna you're gonna retire

1494
02:16:08.94 --> 02:16:15.18
I was really close at that point I was weighing it pros and cons in my head that's not what

1495
02:16:15.18 --> 02:16:22.30
influenced me in any way I um I made I actually frankly can't recall if it was how soon after

1496
02:16:22.30 --> 02:16:28.78
that I made the decision but you know it ultimately was about continuing to make a difference and

1497
02:16:28.78 --> 02:16:33.18
and I was I was at year 20 and after being commanding off sort of a team I just felt like there's

1498
02:16:33.18 --> 02:16:38.14
so much more to do in life and while it's awesome to be a seal and I'd already been privileged

1499
02:16:38.14 --> 02:16:42.14
to run meetings in the situation room and like what am I gonna do like another six years and

1500
02:16:42.14 --> 02:16:47.02
return to attend the meetings that I've already run you know so I was like let me just pivot and go

1501
02:16:47.02 --> 02:16:52.38
spend a chapter of my life in the in the private sector which I'm 10 years into now and have been

1502
02:16:52.38 --> 02:17:00.14
really fortunate and learn a ton and and at some point in my life I'll return in some capacity to

1503
02:17:00.14 --> 02:17:04.94
serve this nation and I'm not sure what what former fashion that will take I really have no idea

1504
02:17:04.94 --> 02:17:10.30
I just know that when you're open to service it will find you and the ways we serve now are genuinely

1505
02:17:10.30 --> 02:17:13.74
doing things like writing books and trying to make a difference for gold star communities and

1506
02:17:13.74 --> 02:17:21.98
just continuing to elevate the conversation. How was your transition when you retired? I know people

1507
02:17:21.98 --> 02:17:28.06
asked me that time that question a lot and and I always give the advice of like hey when you get out

1508
02:17:28.06 --> 02:17:33.66
you need a new mission because you've been on mission of super hyper focused on this one thing

1509
02:17:33.66 --> 02:17:38.30
for your whole life for everything from how to freaking put your web gear together in the most

1510
02:17:38.30 --> 02:17:42.54
efficient ways your magazines are on the right place for an off hand draw like all those little

1511
02:17:42.54 --> 02:17:47.02
things that we are focused on for 20 years and then you get you go up through the ranks we're

1512
02:17:47.02 --> 02:17:50.86
now you're focused on how can my platoon do this better how can my task do this better for you

1513
02:17:50.86 --> 02:17:56.22
it's how can I do this better for my team how can I better support them and then one day in one

1514
02:17:56.22 --> 02:18:02.94
day you clean out your locker your a civilian and I always tell guys hey man you gotta find a new

1515
02:18:02.94 --> 02:18:07.58
mission and it sounds like you got all mission pretty quick when you got out did you did you already

1516
02:18:07.58 --> 02:18:14.38
have that did you already have job set up when you retired yeah I did I was again I've been

1517
02:18:14.38 --> 02:18:18.38
very fortunate because I had exposure that that few people are privileged to have whether it was

1518
02:18:18.38 --> 02:18:24.54
the White House Fellows program or two years of of a pretty reputable graduate school and so you

1519
02:18:24.54 --> 02:18:32.14
know I I didn't know what I would do when I made the decision to retire but I I had a lot of

1520
02:18:32.14 --> 02:18:39.66
conversations to try to go find that thing I had great mentors and in ultimately you know had

1521
02:18:39.66 --> 02:18:44.46
had offers at Goldman Sachs and at JPMorgan and at Bridgewater the hedge fund where I ultimately

1522
02:18:44.46 --> 02:18:49.66
went good good really good front of mine Dave McCormack who actually just ran for Senate in Pennsylvania

1523
02:18:50.86 --> 02:18:54.86
was in the Bush administration the the Treasury wall I was at the National Security Council

1524
02:18:54.86 --> 02:19:00.94
but Dave is a a a good really good human and really good friend and just asked him for some advice and

1525
02:19:00.94 --> 02:19:07.50
and and he ultimately created another option that I wasn't trying to create and I jumped into

1526
02:19:07.50 --> 02:19:11.42
to Bridgewater with him and in a couple of other really great leaders and learned to turn there

1527
02:19:11.42 --> 02:19:17.34
and that was my first chapter so look it's really it can when you look in the rear view mirror

1528
02:19:17.34 --> 02:19:22.14
with transition you can say oh it must have been really easy no way man it's super freaking hard

1529
02:19:22.14 --> 02:19:27.10
like because we're all planners you know in the teams we're not like we're not letting life just

1530
02:19:27.10 --> 02:19:32.78
happen to us we're planning life and this is an element of time when you're like it takes patience

1531
02:19:32.78 --> 02:19:38.22
to for the plan to come together it's not like you can plan harder and create things to happen

1532
02:19:38.22 --> 02:19:43.18
in 12 hours and and man I'm bad at a lot of things but patience is definitely one of my weeks

1533
02:19:43.18 --> 02:19:51.02
weeks spots you have this this section which I think kind of wraps up some of your transition here

1534
02:19:51.90 --> 02:19:55.98
you say this I hear the question all the time how did you manage to move from the military to the

1535
02:19:55.98 --> 02:20:01.66
government to the private sector when those arenas are so different from each other my answer is

1536
02:20:01.66 --> 02:20:06.14
to premise the challenge or challenge the premise of this question of course there are different

1537
02:20:06.14 --> 02:20:11.90
different details different specifics but the truth is in my experience all high stakes organizations

1538
02:20:11.90 --> 02:20:18.22
and all high stakes decisions are pretty much the same the concrete knowledge you need is the

1539
02:20:18.22 --> 02:20:24.06
easy part anyone can learn that but the details don't matter if you don't have the right process

1540
02:20:24.06 --> 02:20:28.94
and if you do have the right process you can go anywhere it's why strong leaders are able to jump

1541
02:20:28.94 --> 02:20:36.62
from one industry to another one organization to another so that's what you did apply to your

1542
02:20:36.62 --> 02:20:42.06
your decision making process your your lessons learned from the military you applied to the

1543
02:20:42.06 --> 02:20:49.50
government sector I guess and then to the to the civilian sector so you did bridge water for a few

1544
02:20:49.50 --> 02:20:56.30
years and then you ended up actually entering the another business right with with cognizant

1545
02:20:56.30 --> 02:21:01.66
yep and then what was that experience like well first all bridge water is a phenomenal place four

1546
02:21:01.66 --> 02:21:09.02
years it is it is a crucible of of of talent that is all trying to be more talented and do great

1547
02:21:09.02 --> 02:21:13.98
things in in markets and in ultimately how to manage the company so that they can outperform in

1548
02:21:13.98 --> 02:21:18.54
markets and the mission is very simply to figure out what's going on in the world and how to

1549
02:21:18.54 --> 02:21:25.34
how to capitalize on that for for their own investors you know police retirements and teacher

1550
02:21:25.34 --> 02:21:30.06
retirements and you know sovereign wealth funds and things like that so I like the mission of

1551
02:21:30.06 --> 02:21:36.86
figure out what's going on in the world right it's a large thing yeah it was so that they do quite well

1552
02:21:36.86 --> 02:21:42.30
over their bridge water very well and and so but but after you know four years or so three and

1553
02:21:42.30 --> 02:21:46.62
half four years I was ready to pivot and a really good front of mine started a company called

1554
02:21:46.62 --> 02:21:51.74
cognizant he spun them out of uh done in Brad Street twenty-fut at the time twenty-five years ago

1555
02:21:51.74 --> 02:21:56.46
and twenty-five years prior and then they had an activist investor take a billion six position

1556
02:21:56.46 --> 02:21:59.98
in the stock and start agitating and and I just call them and said hey man here's what you need

1557
02:21:59.98 --> 02:22:03.74
to be thinking about just this this and this and that the other thing and you might just come

1558
02:22:03.74 --> 02:22:07.74
help me come help me run the company and I was like I'd never been at a large public company and I was like

1559
02:22:07.74 --> 02:22:12.54
look let me bet on myself this is risky I'm not sure I'm gonna be great at this but I'm gonna go

1560
02:22:12.54 --> 02:22:17.98
figure it out and it it's what you just read in the book and and honestly I think I did very well there

1561
02:22:17.98 --> 02:22:25.34
and and I've continued to you know pivot I'm now running global operations and transformation and

1562
02:22:25.34 --> 02:22:34.06
and uh security and real estate etc for for VMware it's a large software company and with with

1563
02:22:34.06 --> 02:22:39.74
very public news right now about a potential acquisition or an acquisition again very public

1564
02:22:39.74 --> 02:22:44.86
knowledge and and VMware is an awesome organization in so many different ways and and just bringing

1565
02:22:44.86 --> 02:22:51.34
the same exact you know skill set if you will to VMware but with some of the knowledge that you

1566
02:22:51.34 --> 02:22:56.14
that I've learned along the way the ten years so it's a combination of specific knowledge but also

1567
02:22:56.78 --> 02:23:02.22
you know the the management skill of seeing forests and trees but definitely both.

1568
02:23:02.94 --> 02:23:07.02
Yeah we've been my company excellent funds been working with VMware we've worked with VMware

1569
02:23:07.02 --> 02:23:12.54
decent amount but the fun thing is for me the first time I worked with him was telling him hey

1570
02:23:12.54 --> 02:23:19.02
I used to carry VMware stuff in the field and hook it up to my satellite radio and make

1571
02:23:19.02 --> 02:23:22.70
columns and they were all pretty stoked and they got a good veteran community there really

1572
02:23:22.70 --> 02:23:30.06
VMware so awesome company. Well you know and I forgot to mention the I know that the team thought

1573
02:23:30.06 --> 02:23:37.82
incredibly highly of your and and Eshelon front's leadership and instruction and motivation and

1574
02:23:37.82 --> 02:23:42.46
inspiration everything that you are that you espouse has made a huge positive impact on people and

1575
02:23:42.46 --> 02:23:46.22
whenever that that finished up I think it was about a week ago or something like one of them was

1576
02:23:46.22 --> 02:23:50.46
the most recent was about a week ago I got eat multiple emails saying hey this guy's awesome

1577
02:23:50.46 --> 02:23:54.30
everything from like people who know that we know each other and others like hey you ever heard of this

1578
02:23:54.30 --> 02:24:00.78
willing guy you know like yeah yeah I heard of right on so you got that going on in the

1579
02:24:00.78 --> 02:24:06.46
Civilian sector that that chief digital transformation officer and at the me in the meantime you

1580
02:24:06.46 --> 02:24:13.58
know you mentioned giving back and you are giving back and one of the things that you're doing

1581
02:24:13.58 --> 02:24:18.86
which is incredible is this book that we've been reading through today this book which is called

1582
02:24:18.86 --> 02:24:26.70
Never Enough you've taken all the profits from this book all the profits from this book and you are

1583
02:24:26.70 --> 02:24:35.02
very specifically giving the profits to gold star families and very specifically in order to pay off

1584
02:24:35.02 --> 02:24:42.78
their mortgages and this is you know home ownership is not only the American dream but it's also

1585
02:24:43.98 --> 02:24:48.06
the American nightmare when you've got a mortgage to pay or when you don't have a place to live

1586
02:24:48.06 --> 02:24:53.42
free if that comes under pressure there's just there's just a you know your home is your castle

1587
02:24:54.06 --> 02:24:58.46
and so this idea and I'm not sure quite how you can't you probably can't have a conclusion the way

1588
02:24:58.46 --> 02:25:04.46
I just spoke through which is listen if there's anything we could give a gold star family the best

1589
02:25:04.46 --> 02:25:11.66
thing we can give them in terms of security and peace of mind is to say hey you can you don't have

1590
02:25:11.66 --> 02:25:16.62
to worry about where you're going to live forever and so that's what you're doing with this and you

1591
02:25:16.62 --> 02:25:20.62
know it's funny I was asking you well like is there a website we can put out or anything you're like

1592
02:25:20.62 --> 02:25:25.66
nope it's not it's it's you're you're you even want to spend money on a website you you're like

1593
02:25:25.66 --> 02:25:32.38
a hundred percent it all goes to buying these houses for gold star families and I personally know

1594
02:25:32.38 --> 02:25:38.38
some of the people that you've done this for again I can't imagine a better gift to give a gold star

1595
02:25:38.38 --> 02:25:44.78
family then the absolute peace of mind of here's a place for you to live and security for the

1596
02:25:44.78 --> 02:25:50.06
rest of your life how did you get to that how did you get to that goal well it's thanks for sharing

1597
02:25:50.06 --> 02:25:54.46
that I really appreciate that because that is really you know multiple goals with never enough one

1598
02:25:54.46 --> 02:25:59.10
is to elevate the conversation but a very very tangible one is to literally pay off more pages like

1599
02:25:59.10 --> 02:26:05.98
you describe and just from seeing firsthand the situations where you know the the government doesn't

1600
02:26:05.98 --> 02:26:11.50
really cover nearly as much as as you would expect in in a situation where there's somebody killed

1601
02:26:11.50 --> 02:26:18.06
an action or who dies by suicide and I just felt like there's a gap in the community there's plenty

1602
02:26:18.06 --> 02:26:24.22
of fishing trips and mental health about like all very very good things but the most fundamental

1603
02:26:24.22 --> 02:26:29.42
thing is for these families not to feel the pressure of needing to move from the communities that

1604
02:26:29.42 --> 02:26:36.14
have hugged them for the previous one or 15 years of their lives and if you could you imagine being

1605
02:26:36.14 --> 02:26:41.74
a gold star widow all of a sudden not that any of none of them make that choice nobody wants that

1606
02:26:41.74 --> 02:26:48.78
title and and being pressure to leave your community like it's unfathomable to me and so I

1607
02:26:48.78 --> 02:26:54.14
just really was fired up that we don't do more and so at this point we very very confidentially

1608
02:26:54.14 --> 02:27:01.58
paid off six mortgages and I'm on a drive to do more and ultimately alleviate this burden for

1609
02:27:01.58 --> 02:27:05.98
for really every one of these families that has experienced this and I wish we could wave

1610
02:27:05.98 --> 02:27:12.62
a magic wand and do all of them all at once but look it's it's it's it's really what drives me

1611
02:27:12.62 --> 02:27:18.46
in one of the ways that that I try to not I mean that I am giving back and if people want to help

1612
02:27:18.46 --> 02:27:23.90
that cause I was real simple going by this book that's just that's how you help this cause hey look

1613
02:27:23.90 --> 02:27:28.30
when you get awesome lessons cool we get some cool stories yes you will but you will you'll be

1614
02:27:28.30 --> 02:27:34.54
able to help out these gold star families so freaking outstanding you're also you're also involved

1615
02:27:34.54 --> 02:27:39.74
with the national Medal of Honor Museum so so tell me what's going on with that yeah great we

1616
02:27:39.74 --> 02:27:46.30
I'm on the board of a museum that the nation hasn't built so about four years ago I got asked to

1617
02:27:46.30 --> 02:27:50.70
give somebody some advice there was something that was a small local effort in South Carolina

1618
02:27:50.70 --> 02:27:56.30
long story short they this person asked me to join the board I said you know like all of us are

1619
02:27:56.30 --> 02:28:03.02
too busy don't have time excuse blah blah blah blah blah and and then for personal reasons

1620
02:28:03.02 --> 02:28:09.10
after sharing a story back and forth I said okay you've got me I'll join the board on one condition

1621
02:28:09.74 --> 02:28:13.66
we get to fire everybody who's on the board and we're gonna make this thing go national

1622
02:28:13.66 --> 02:28:18.06
so we raised at this point a hundred and sixty five million dollars we've got about sixty

1623
02:28:18.06 --> 02:28:23.90
million more to go we took us three years but we worked through a concept to city selection

1624
02:28:23.90 --> 02:28:28.54
New York City offered us governor's island and Washington DC offered us a spot in the mall

1625
02:28:29.66 --> 02:28:34.54
we ultimately did a bake-off between those plus Denver in our LinkedIn Texas we chose our

1626
02:28:34.54 --> 02:28:39.18
LinkedIn Texas we're building the museum right next to AT&T Stadium we've got an incredible board

1627
02:28:39.18 --> 02:28:44.94
we've got all of the ex presidents with the exception of of president Trump mostly from a timing

1628
02:28:44.94 --> 02:28:51.90
perspective you know we're we're we have great momentum this is irreversible at this point

1629
02:28:51.90 --> 02:28:56.94
of course not surprisingly the the CEO of the museum is my swim buddy that we've talked about

1630
02:28:56.94 --> 02:29:02.94
Chris Cassidy he's a phenomenal American you know seal astronaut and now CEO of this museum

1631
02:29:02.94 --> 02:29:08.30
and what we're really doing with this is we're on a mission to inspire America we will we will

1632
02:29:08.30 --> 02:29:15.10
take the lessons that the metal of honor recipients have that that they espouse the character

1633
02:29:15.10 --> 02:29:21.34
the values etc and and talk about that to make the nation greater and and the vision is for

1634
02:29:21.34 --> 02:29:26.14
you know some young kid to see the brits LeBinsky and what he did and learn about his

1635
02:29:26.14 --> 02:29:30.30
character values or you know strike brits name and replace it with any recipient and say

1636
02:29:31.02 --> 02:29:36.30
how do I you know I'm seeing this little third third grade situation develop a I see a girl

1637
02:29:36.30 --> 02:29:42.22
being bullied on the school yard how do I step in and go make this situation right that is what we

1638
02:29:42.22 --> 02:29:48.06
we want to stop that or school shootings or or having the bravery the courage to step in during

1639
02:29:48.06 --> 02:29:52.94
a school shooting and and stop the shooting from happening or just to make the make our nation

1640
02:29:52.94 --> 02:29:59.58
stronger and better and the the premise is really to inspire America we will open in about a year and a

1641
02:29:59.58 --> 02:30:04.94
half what we haven't to completely determine our opening date but this will be one of the nations

1642
02:30:04.94 --> 02:30:10.78
if not them I should say the the premier museum for the nation that will tell the stories of the

1643
02:30:10.78 --> 02:30:18.06
roughly 3500 recipients and 64 living recipients many of them many of whom you personally know and

1644
02:30:18.06 --> 02:30:23.58
and just get their stories out there yeah that's that's just awesome I mean just the idea of

1645
02:30:24.30 --> 02:30:31.58
giving people examples to read about and to be introduced to that they can try and follow in their

1646
02:30:31.58 --> 02:30:38.62
footsteps at least be inspired by and yeah that's just that's just phenomenal I mean while

1647
02:30:38.62 --> 02:30:42.14
I look on maybe a couple you I guess it was maybe a year and a half two years ago you you

1648
02:30:42.14 --> 02:30:49.18
okay show me a text hey you know we're looking for a CEO of this of this the metal vanner

1649
02:30:49.18 --> 02:30:53.34
museum thing if you know anybody let me know and I was like I racked my brain a little bit

1650
02:30:53.34 --> 02:30:57.26
mom I definitely couldn't give you I couldn't have given you a candidate to do this crispy

1651
02:30:57.26 --> 02:31:03.90
so that's that's that's an awesome guy to to to take the to take the lead on that and so

1652
02:31:03.90 --> 02:31:08.62
did they did they start construction already yes was that when you were you doing the ground

1653
02:31:08.62 --> 02:31:13.58
breaking ceremony when we were both yes pass weeks right this each other in the hotel by whatever

1654
02:31:13.58 --> 02:31:17.74
an hour or something March 25th is Congressional Medal of Honor Day that's the day we broke

1655
02:31:17.74 --> 02:31:25.02
around we had president Bush we had just we we had a lot like 17 or 18 of the living recipients there

1656
02:31:25.02 --> 02:31:31.74
and yes that's when we we came like minutes from linking up with each other well that's awesome

1657
02:31:31.74 --> 02:31:38.70
um does that bring us up to date on your life right now yeah absolutely I mean look I

1658
02:31:40.06 --> 02:31:45.18
life is busy I can't sit still just like you can't it's all about giving back and and I really

1659
02:31:45.18 --> 02:31:51.58
do appreciate for everybody out there just never pushing never enough I promise you it's it won't

1660
02:31:51.58 --> 02:31:57.58
disappoint it's it's it's not been extreme ownership and therefore you can buy it a lot cheaper on Amazon

1661
02:31:57.58 --> 02:32:04.54
so you but really do you appreciate that great support and if people people want to find you

1662
02:32:04.54 --> 02:32:12.30
you have a website which is this is my case dot com you have Instagram which is this is dot my case

1663
02:32:13.10 --> 02:32:19.90
you have Twitter which is this is my case and Facebook the real my case yeah so I don't know

1664
02:32:19.90 --> 02:32:25.34
about you social media was foreign to me about a year ago but you know it's like like the disconfort

1665
02:32:25.34 --> 02:32:32.06
leaning into discomfort it's it's it's part of the new the new us yeah it's definitely a very strange

1666
02:32:32.06 --> 02:32:39.82
thing to go from zero social media and also being anti social media which we were absolutely

1667
02:32:39.82 --> 02:32:47.50
had to be well you kidding me um but yeah it was I guess it was a combination it was it was

1668
02:32:47.50 --> 02:32:54.94
life babbins wife Jenna who was like you got to get on social media I'm like no I think

1669
02:32:54.94 --> 02:33:00.62
life life it makes me now you know where I'm like no we don't need it not doing it and then Jamie

1670
02:33:00.62 --> 02:33:06.22
who who's the CEO of one of my companies is like you should really do this I'm like I don't think

1671
02:33:06.22 --> 02:33:10.54
we need to and then Tim Ferris who said dude you better get on Twitter or your nitty it I was like

1672
02:33:10.54 --> 02:33:15.02
all right time there's a bunch of people that are telling me to do this what's real I have to say

1673
02:33:15.02 --> 02:33:20.22
you know it's really funny is of course I follow you and when you show the 404 30 wakeups

1674
02:33:20.22 --> 02:33:24.38
I keep saying to myself I'm gonna get the exact same watch and set it for one minute earlier

1675
02:33:24.38 --> 02:33:28.30
than you and take my picture and just show that my I'm a minute earlier than you every single

1676
02:33:28.30 --> 02:33:31.98
morning but I just haven't had the energy to actually pull it off. Yeah there's there's been

1677
02:33:31.98 --> 02:33:36.62
some campaigns on that I know Andy's dump for a while was he forget if he was waking up earlier

1678
02:33:37.34 --> 02:33:41.02
or he was doing something something like that there's also a whole host to people that

1679
02:33:41.02 --> 02:33:47.50
you know show their their watch at 1042 in front of a box of donuts and you know just got after it

1680
02:33:48.70 --> 02:33:53.58
but yeah so that's where the people can find you echo you got any questions oh yeah real quick

1681
02:33:53.58 --> 02:33:58.30
the no the fellowship program or your job at the White House how often do you see the president

1682
02:33:59.58 --> 02:34:05.58
it depends on what role you're in the fellows get together a couple times during the year with the

1683
02:34:05.58 --> 02:34:12.62
president and and have these candid off the record conversations and then if you're in a role

1684
02:34:12.62 --> 02:34:16.22
like I was at the National Security Council sometimes it was three times in a week and then

1685
02:34:16.22 --> 02:34:20.62
it'd be a month without seeing the president so a little bit varied depending on what was going on

1686
02:34:20.62 --> 02:34:27.10
in the world. That's your rush yep that was easy one that's throwing softballs looking for the

1687
02:34:27.10 --> 02:34:31.58
high and inside fastball from my control. That's just the only thing that you can eat what you'll

1688
02:34:31.58 --> 02:34:39.98
know. Sorry for taking it easy for me. Awesome. Mike any closing thoughts? No just extreme appreciation

1689
02:34:39.98 --> 02:34:46.78
I think that's maybe the next extreme appreciation besides extreme ownership but just so appreciate

1690
02:34:46.78 --> 02:34:53.42
you and and all of our our community and the the nation for helping elevate the conversation

1691
02:34:53.42 --> 02:34:57.50
and just recognizing that you know while we were in the service we're ultimately all here to

1692
02:34:57.50 --> 02:35:01.90
serve each other and it takes different forms and fashions and I just encourage people to get off

1693
02:35:01.90 --> 02:35:06.70
the sideline and serve in whatever way makes the most sense to everybody listening and just

1694
02:35:06.70 --> 02:35:12.14
great appreciation for being here. Jocco it's a real um special day for me to be able to be

1695
02:35:12.14 --> 02:35:16.30
shocking when we go from you know water polo and kill in each other are you killing me in the

1696
02:35:16.30 --> 02:35:21.18
pool and then and this many years later seeing where we both are in life it's it's fun.

1697
02:35:21.74 --> 02:35:27.26
Kind of crazy man well speaking of service thanks for your service to the country

1698
02:35:27.26 --> 02:35:34.06
to the nation to the teams for what you've for what you've done in your past and for what you're

1699
02:35:34.06 --> 02:35:38.86
doing today not only the civilian sector but more important for what you're doing today to take

1700
02:35:38.86 --> 02:35:43.98
care of the families of our fallen teammates so thanks for coming out man sorry to because

1701
02:35:43.98 --> 02:35:49.74
so while to get this together but appreciate it man. All good brothers my pleasure thank you Jocco

1702
02:35:49.74 --> 02:35:58.14
thank you I could Charles and with that my case has left the building I go Charles yes sir

1703
02:35:59.34 --> 02:36:05.02
key takeaways what do you got to go it's the one key takeaways kind of a reminder something that I guess

1704
02:36:05.98 --> 02:36:11.66
yeah yeah I guess you talk about this but anyway he said on a few occasions process can save life

1705
02:36:12.30 --> 02:36:18.62
the process because and it's one of those things where I'm personally I think I fall victim to this a

1706
02:36:18.62 --> 02:36:27.10
lot of the time where I kind of I'm not used to having for lack of a living term or where like you

1707
02:36:27.10 --> 02:36:33.74
know there I don't have any many I guess I do have some processes in place but sometimes I can put

1708
02:36:33.74 --> 02:36:38.30
it this I can get distracted you can get the process I'm going to take joint warfare dude yeah

1709
02:36:38.30 --> 02:36:44.22
I'm not saying I have all the processes for all things for sure but I get distracted from the process

1710
02:36:44.22 --> 02:36:51.42
kind of easy even though I know that if I stick to the process the chances of success go way up

1711
02:36:51.82 --> 02:36:57.18
exponentially and I think that's kind of like and I think about myself and I think how generally

1712
02:36:57.18 --> 02:37:01.90
speaking this can be the case where if you allow that to happen like whether be because of stress

1713
02:37:01.90 --> 02:37:07.02
because of you know just whatever kind of distraction or whatever that's that's how it works

1714
02:37:07.02 --> 02:37:12.30
where if you just stick to the process you can keep yourself out of a lot of trouble even in like

1715
02:37:12.30 --> 02:37:19.02
hectic kind of situation yeah and the dichotomy is sometimes you gotta get outside the process

1716
02:37:19.02 --> 02:37:25.26
gotta be flexible you know it's people literally say think outside the box yeah so you got to

1717
02:37:25.26 --> 02:37:30.54
know index with when it's say the sex of the process and when the yeah making adjustment yeah

1718
02:37:30.54 --> 02:37:36.22
like the process can be somewhat flexible but the process is the process for a reason yeah it's like

1719
02:37:36.22 --> 02:37:41.26
okay so think of it in terms like jiu-jitsu for example like when things start to get you know

1720
02:37:41.26 --> 02:37:46.22
let's say I'm rolling with you yeah and you know you start turning up the heat on me all of a sudden

1721
02:37:46.22 --> 02:37:52.14
for whatever reason that's going on in your head I can't get all panicky and start going off

1722
02:37:53.02 --> 02:37:57.66
natural like instinct I gotta stick to the technique yeah seems saying sure I can turn on my

1723
02:37:57.66 --> 02:38:02.38
urgency but I stick to the process which is the technique to get ideas stick to what you've learned

1724
02:38:02.38 --> 02:38:07.26
like that can stuff that's that's a version of the process yep but there's also a situation where

1725
02:38:07.26 --> 02:38:13.34
you might have to do something that's against the process a little bit jiffy-glover jiffy-glover will

1726
02:38:13.34 --> 02:38:19.10
do some wild things yeah but if they're not it well I'm gonna get I can't read just mine yeah but

1727
02:38:19.10 --> 02:38:24.86
I will say this the stuff the creative stuff that he does is all within the realm of jiu-jitsu that he's

1728
02:38:24.86 --> 02:38:30.86
either learned or experimented no no because nowhere in jiu-jitsu does say like oh turn your back

1729
02:38:30.86 --> 02:38:36.06
nowhere and it doesn't say that anywhere well that's his idea now I would say this and

1730
02:38:36.06 --> 02:38:39.58
I'm not saying you're wrong necessarily but this is what I'm what about Pete the Greek

1731
02:38:39.58 --> 02:38:43.74
going for wrist all the time okay so let's say that's still jiu-jitsu because what I'm saying

1732
02:38:43.74 --> 02:38:48.54
so think of this I mean I'm talking about my focus on the rest I'm put it this way they're not

1733
02:38:48.54 --> 02:38:53.26
doing this on rest lock they don't do that they don't do that because they get distracted or

1734
02:38:53.26 --> 02:38:59.02
taking out of their game they do that voluntarily as part of the game yeah seems saying outside

1735
02:38:59.02 --> 02:39:03.26
the process though is all I'm saying maybe that is within their process maybe they're

1736
02:39:03.26 --> 02:39:09.82
probably telling you like no there's no process in jiu-jitsu seven years ago that said hey

1737
02:39:10.06 --> 02:39:15.66
turn your back on the person on the person there's no no no one said that do you predict

1738
02:39:15.66 --> 02:39:19.98
Jeffy Glover just did it I know you can't read just mine or Pete the Greek or anyone for that matter

1739
02:39:19.98 --> 02:39:23.98
but would you say yes or no would you say that turning his back

1740
02:39:24.86 --> 02:39:27.42
done out of creativity do you think that's part of his process

1741
02:39:27.42 --> 02:39:33.66
I didn't say it wasn't part of his process as they part of the process

1742
02:39:34.70 --> 02:39:40.06
all right so because you said trust love process and what I'm saying is okay your process

1743
02:39:40.06 --> 02:39:44.14
and how about that okay trust your process hey if there's a process in place I'm saying

1744
02:39:44.14 --> 02:39:50.78
if there's a process in place go ahead trust it yep to a significant degree to a significant degree okay

1745
02:39:50.78 --> 02:39:54.46
and what I mean what I mean we can say what I mean and you just

1746
02:39:54.46 --> 02:39:59.98
I'm saying don't get distracted meaning don't go on like if you start going all crazy hard

1747
02:40:00.54 --> 02:40:05.02
is it beneficial for me to involuntarily go all crazy hard back yeah like that's trying to

1748
02:40:05.02 --> 02:40:09.18
go kind of quite a fire is all they're like involuntarily and what's that like this well

1749
02:40:09.18 --> 02:40:14.46
you're making it you're making me get all specific over here with though and his and all this other stuff

1750
02:40:14.46 --> 02:40:22.06
on process right on yeah no point now right on no okay

1751
02:40:22.06 --> 02:40:27.66
I'm trying to I'm trying to trust the process myself and you trying to make a point I'm trying

1752
02:40:27.66 --> 02:40:33.42
not to ridicule it too hard yes there is process that's why we have standard operating procedures

1753
02:40:33.42 --> 02:40:36.94
right and you gotta stay within those standard operating procedures to your point

1754
02:40:38.22 --> 02:40:43.58
a lot of that time yeah but you can't get stuck in them so what complacency distraction panic

1755
02:40:43.58 --> 02:40:47.58
these are all things that can make you deviate from the process yeah and then which kind of

1756
02:40:47.58 --> 02:40:53.18
goes along to my secondary thing take away which is how and you guys but you can say this a lot

1757
02:40:53.18 --> 02:40:58.46
all the time too it's like staying calm and really making it a point to stay calm which kind

1758
02:40:58.46 --> 02:41:04.14
it can be rolled into the process right not only is it part of the process potentially it helps you

1759
02:41:04.14 --> 02:41:08.78
stick to the process one should be all right so we're sticking to the process speaking to

1760
02:41:08.78 --> 02:41:13.82
sticking to the process get yourself a subscription to a joint warfare let's say super curl yeah

02:46:14.86 --> 02:46:20.94
someone go a girl goes out to a party and there's another girl there and they were in the same dress

1815
02:46:20.94 --> 02:46:25.42
yes and it's drama man this is drama man or as my daughters would call it you know what that is this tea

1816
02:46:25.42 --> 02:46:32.30
what a tea no it's just tea it's tea it's tea is a meme of like someone drinking tea and it's

1817
02:46:32.30 --> 02:46:38.86
sort of like drama so you can say that's tea you see you're not called up no you don't you

1818
02:46:38.86 --> 02:46:43.50
don't you don't hit like me I don't see the correlation to tea in drama it comes from a meme

1819
02:46:44.54 --> 02:46:51.50
where someone's drinking tea oh yeah covered the frogs drinking tea and it represents drama

1820
02:46:51.50 --> 02:46:57.34
okay it's pretty sure the meat I don't know I think you might be right but maybe the

1821
02:46:57.34 --> 02:47:04.06
root so I'm the frog is drinking tea and he said it all the meme will always say something something

1822
02:47:04.06 --> 02:47:10.70
but that's not a my business there and drinking tea so so you will get let's say a

1823
02:47:10.70 --> 02:47:15.50
what group is this millennial no it's lower than millennial what's not lower but what's

1824
02:47:15.50 --> 02:47:21.82
younger than millennial I think it's Z so Jen Z I think with L say oh and they won't say tell me the

1825
02:47:21.82 --> 02:47:28.54
gossip you'll say tell me the tea do you not know this I this is news to me yes okay

1826
02:47:28.54 --> 02:47:35.50
oh absolutely I did not that's good that's good cool oh so yeah so there they go yeah if you

1827
02:47:35.50 --> 02:47:40.54
want the tea get a good tea show right you're saying you're saying one girl show up to the

1828
02:47:40.54 --> 02:47:45.74
body and somebody's wearing the same outfit yeah that's some tea for your do this drama right so when

1829
02:47:45.74 --> 02:47:49.50
you get we when you're part of the Charlotte locker no one's showing up with the same t-shirt as you

1830
02:47:49.50 --> 02:47:55.02
well actually technically if they do you kind of like dot you're kind of down yeah no tea well here's

1831
02:47:55.02 --> 02:48:00.70
the thing it's kind of cool the tea scenario with my girl over the small country when you do that

1832
02:48:00.70 --> 02:48:05.42

1834
02:48:12.78 --> 02:48:19.18
the same location is opposite with males it's opposite okay that's like the thing this is why you

1835
02:48:19.18 --> 02:48:23.98
