00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.16 This is Jockel Podcast number 54.
00:00:06.16 --> 00:00:10.32 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:11.72 Good evening, I go.
00:00:11.72 --> 00:00:15.40 Good evening.
00:00:15.40 --> 00:00:20.28 uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
00:00:20.28 --> 00:00:24.48 You got some Shakespeare right there.
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:28.88 You got some Henry IV part two.
00:00:28.88 --> 00:00:41.60 And that play is a play that came just prior to Henry V, the hero, the warrior, the leader
00:00:41.60 --> 00:00:47.76 of that few, that happy few, that band of brothers.
00:00:47.76 --> 00:00:58.84 Well, his dad, Henry IV, was having a rough time in the kingdom facing rebellion.
00:00:58.84 --> 00:01:06.96 And there's a point in the play where he, the old man, Henry IV, he can't sleep.
00:01:06.96 --> 00:01:12.56 Can't sleep because the pressure, the pressure and the weight of being a leader.
00:01:12.56 --> 00:01:18.16 And it's a great, it's a great chunk of the play.
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:20.000 And it starts with that line.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.28 On easy lies the head that wears a crown.
00:01:23.28 --> 00:01:28.48 And it actually doesn't start with that line, that's the last line.
00:01:28.48 --> 00:01:30.12 It starts off a little different.
00:01:30.12 --> 00:01:32.96 It starts off here.
00:01:32.96 --> 00:01:41.88 How many thousand of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep?
00:01:41.88 --> 00:01:45.40 So he's saying, hey, out there, you know, there's thousands and thousands of my subjects.
00:01:45.40 --> 00:01:51.84 They're out there asleep in right now.
00:01:51.84 --> 00:02:00.76 So sleep, oh, gentle sleep, nature's soft nurse, how have I frightened me?
00:02:00.76 --> 00:02:10.28 That thou will, that thou no more will weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in
00:02:10.28 --> 00:02:12.56 forgetfulness.
00:02:12.56 --> 00:02:14.12 So he's talking to sleep.
00:02:14.12 --> 00:02:16.92 Sleep is like a, like a god to him at this point.
00:02:16.92 --> 00:02:18.92 And he said, what did I do to scare you off?
00:02:18.92 --> 00:02:22.84 What do I do? What can you bring me that goodness?
00:02:22.84 --> 00:02:26.40 Wait down my eyes.
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:30.36 Going back, why rather sleep?
00:02:30.36 --> 00:02:38.60 Myest thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching the and hushed with buzzing
00:02:38.60 --> 00:02:42.52 night flies to thy slumber?
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:50.86 And in perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with
00:02:50.86 --> 00:02:54.96 sound of sweetest melody.
00:02:54.96 --> 00:02:56.52 So he's asking sleep.
00:02:56.52 --> 00:02:57.76 He's saying, look, sleep.
00:02:57.76 --> 00:02:58.76 You're there.
00:02:58.76 --> 00:03:04.12 You're there hanging out with the smoky filthy houses and hovels and people are sleeping
00:03:04.12 --> 00:03:08.36 on boards and to low people are sleeping.
00:03:08.36 --> 00:03:13.52 Those situations, it's insects buzzing around their heads.
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:15.36 You sleep's all there.
00:03:15.36 --> 00:03:17.16 Taking care of those people.
00:03:17.16 --> 00:03:24.68 But sleep doesn't come to him in the most beautiful in the most luxurious, astate rooms,
00:03:24.68 --> 00:03:27.64 where there's a little gentle music playing.
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:28.64 No bugs flying around.
00:03:28.64 --> 00:03:33.52 It's a gentle music playing.
00:03:33.52 --> 00:03:42.72 Back to the play, oh thou doggard, why lieest thou with the vile in loen some beds and
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:50.88 leaveest thy kingly couch, a watch case, or a common larym bell.
00:03:50.88 --> 00:03:57.76 So same, same subject he's saying, look, why do you doggard, so dogg meaning sleeping?
00:03:57.76 --> 00:04:04.36 Don't worry, why are you hanging around the nastiest beds, but you know, this beautiful
00:04:04.36 --> 00:04:06.16 bed, you don't come near it.
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:14.08 You leave it vacant, like a watch tower, like a bell tower.
00:04:14.08 --> 00:04:21.20 Will thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the ship boys eyes?
00:04:21.20 --> 00:04:26.28 So now he's talking to start talking about even a sailor at sea.
00:04:26.28 --> 00:04:33.12 High up on a mast, right, a giddy mast.
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:40.56 You seal up the ship boys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude, imperious
00:04:40.56 --> 00:04:42.04 surge.
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:48.36 And in the visitation of winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous
00:04:48.36 --> 00:04:55.32 heads and hanging them with deafening clamor in the slippery clouds that with the
00:04:55.32 --> 00:05:01.16 early death itself awakes.
00:05:01.16 --> 00:05:07.80 So he's saying this sailor, there's a sailor at sea who's getting punished by the storm
00:05:07.80 --> 00:05:14.12 and the thunder is cropping and the ship is bounding back and forth.
00:05:14.12 --> 00:05:15.12 But guess what?
00:05:15.12 --> 00:05:16.80 He gets to fall asleep.
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:22.28 He goes to sleep, no problem.
00:05:22.28 --> 00:05:31.52 It's thou oparsal sleep, give thy repose to the wet sea boy in an hour so rude and in
00:05:31.52 --> 00:05:41.28 the calmest and most stillest night with all appliances and means to boot the night to a
00:05:41.28 --> 00:05:43.96 king.
00:05:43.96 --> 00:05:50.72 So he's saying again, in an hour so rude storms mayhem at sea.
00:05:50.72 --> 00:05:53.88 He gives the, he gives the sailor sleep.
00:05:53.88 --> 00:06:04.000 But in this calmest and most stillest night with every available luxury to boot, yet
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.44 sleep is denied to the king.
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:19.32 And then he says, then happy low lie down, uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
00:06:19.32 --> 00:06:24.08 So then happy low lie down, he's saying, look, low by low, he means the peasants.
00:06:24.08 --> 00:06:33.40 He's like, all right, then you happy happy low, you peasants lie down, lie down, sleep.
00:06:33.40 --> 00:06:37.08 That's what you get.
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:41.32 But uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
00:06:41.32 --> 00:06:45.32 The leader doesn't get to rest.
00:06:45.32 --> 00:06:46.60 The leader doesn't get to sleep.
00:06:46.60 --> 00:06:53.60 And that's another example of what we know and that is that leadership is hard.
00:06:53.60 --> 00:07:03.24 It's a heavy burden, it's hard business and it's part science and part art.
00:07:03.24 --> 00:07:08.36 And part of it is natural ability and part of it is learned and the book that we're going
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:12.24 to dive into today, it isn't Shakespeare.
00:07:12.24 --> 00:07:21.36 That's actually a military manual, military manual written by SLA Marshall, but guided
00:07:21.36 --> 00:07:26.92 by George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
00:07:26.92 --> 00:07:29.84 This book was written just after World War II.
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:35.32 Now, if you remember Hackworth, if you read about face, Hackworth talks about Marshall,
00:07:35.32 --> 00:07:42.20 SLA Marshall and he did some writing in Vietnam that Hackworth was a little bit
00:07:42.20 --> 00:07:43.68 not impressed with.
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:49.68 And there's certainly some controversy about SLA Marshall and some of the things that he wrote
00:07:49.68 --> 00:07:53.80 in some of the things that he said that he lived through, there's some controversy,
00:07:53.80 --> 00:07:58.52 if not proven fact that he fabricated some stuff.
00:07:58.52 --> 00:08:03.72 But I think you're going to find as we dive into this book, that from a leadership perspective,
00:08:03.72 --> 00:08:07.48 the experiences that he did bring back from World War I, the experiences that he got from
00:08:07.48 --> 00:08:11.20 Eisenhower and from the other Marshall.
00:08:11.20 --> 00:08:17.60 I think it's a really good reflection in a good look at some leadership lessons learned
00:08:17.60 --> 00:08:19.32 that we can take something from.
00:08:19.32 --> 00:08:26.68 Now, the book is actually called the Armed Forces Officer, very simple title, and the
00:08:26.68 --> 00:08:31.60 version that I'm going through, because this book is still in publication, the version that
00:08:31.60 --> 00:08:38.44 I'm going through is from 1950, 1950 version.
00:08:38.44 --> 00:08:43.48 Like I said, it's written in just after World War II, obviously, so the lessons are fresh.
00:08:43.48 --> 00:08:51.40 And I guess that the new version has been cleaned up or something.
00:08:51.40 --> 00:08:56.96 There's, I guess that the 1950s version isn't fully politically correct.
00:08:56.96 --> 00:09:00.80 I don't know because to be frank, I haven't read the new version, because I got the old
00:09:00.80 --> 00:09:01.80 version.
00:09:01.80 --> 00:09:03.84 I want the real deal.
00:09:03.84 --> 00:09:08.40 And I don't find anything offensive in this one, so maybe someone else will.
00:09:08.40 --> 00:09:14.48 I guess there's some things that might be a little bit borderline, but yeah, I'm not,
00:09:14.48 --> 00:09:16.16 I'm not really feeling it.
00:09:16.16 --> 00:09:19.32 And this book was given me a long time ago by a friend of mine that said, you might
00:09:19.32 --> 00:09:20.84 like this.
00:09:20.84 --> 00:09:24.64 And he specifically said, this boy, they'll make this one anymore.
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:25.64 But guess what?
00:09:25.64 --> 00:09:27.04 Everyone's in love because they do.
00:09:27.04 --> 00:09:28.84 They brought it back.
00:09:28.84 --> 00:09:30.28 They brought it back.
00:09:30.28 --> 00:09:38.36 So the book is the Armed Forces Officer, and it really goes into how to lead, how to lead.
00:09:38.36 --> 00:09:40.88 So go into the book.
00:09:40.88 --> 00:09:48.44 To call forth great loyalty and other people and to harness it to any noble undertaking, one
00:09:48.44 --> 00:09:54.76 must first be sensible of their finer instincts and feelings.
00:09:54.76 --> 00:10:02.64 Certainly, these things at least are among the gentle qualities which are desired in every
00:10:02.64 --> 00:10:04.60 military officer of the United States.
00:10:04.60 --> 00:10:10.04 So here's some basic things that the officers, the military are supposed to have.
00:10:10.04 --> 00:10:12.60 One, strong belief in human rights.
00:10:12.60 --> 00:10:16.84 Two, respect for the dignity of every other person.
00:10:16.84 --> 00:10:23.88 Three, the golden rule attitude toward one's daily associates.
00:10:23.88 --> 00:10:28.88 Four, an abiding interest in all aspects of human welfare.
00:10:28.88 --> 00:10:37.60 Five, a willingness to deal with every man as considerably as if he were a blood relative.
00:10:37.60 --> 00:10:40.12 So pretty simple rules.
00:10:40.12 --> 00:10:41.84 Respect other people.
00:10:41.84 --> 00:10:45.48 The golden rule, you know, treat people how you want to be treated yourself.
00:10:45.48 --> 00:10:48.12 These are the basis what they're saying, you need to be.
00:10:48.12 --> 00:10:51.84 And again, let's not actually, I was going to go into this, but they're going to go into
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:52.84 themselves.
00:10:52.84 --> 00:10:53.84 Here we go.
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:54.84 Back to the book.
00:10:54.84 --> 00:10:59.48 The epitome of strength, not of softness.
00:10:59.48 --> 00:11:06.32 They marked a man who's capable of pursuing a great purpose consistently in spite of temptations.
00:11:06.32 --> 00:11:13.64 He who possesses them will all the more surely be regarded as a man among men.
00:11:13.64 --> 00:11:15.36 Take any crowd of new recruits.
00:11:15.36 --> 00:11:19.68 The greater number of them during their first few days in service will use more profanity
00:11:19.68 --> 00:11:20.68 and obscenity.
00:11:20.68 --> 00:11:24.56 Let's talk more about women and boast more about drinking than they have ever done in their
00:11:24.56 --> 00:11:30.12 lives because of the mistaken idea that this is the quick way to get a reputation for being
00:11:30.12 --> 00:11:32.92 a hard-boiled.
00:11:32.92 --> 00:11:38.92 But at the same time, the one or two men among them who stay decent, talk moderately
00:11:38.92 --> 00:11:46.48 and walk the line of duty will uniquely receive the infinite respect of the others.
00:11:46.48 --> 00:11:50.20 It never fails to happen.
00:11:50.20 --> 00:11:53.56 So little contrary to what we might think.
00:11:53.56 --> 00:11:56.000 And there's definitely, when you get the military and you're going through boot camp,
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.56 there's all kinds of people act in tough guys.
00:11:58.56 --> 00:12:01.52 All kinds of people act in tough guys.
00:12:01.52 --> 00:12:06.32 And that happens to see one thing that happens in boot camp.
00:12:06.32 --> 00:12:11.56 I bet I met more potential professional athletes when I was going through.
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:15.28 When I was going through boot camp, everyone was, I was about to go in the NFL.
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:17.96 I was about to be a pro baseball player.
00:12:17.96 --> 00:12:21.48 I don't know why, but they end up in the military.
00:12:21.48 --> 00:12:23.48 Yeah, it is interesting.
00:12:23.48 --> 00:12:26.48 That kind of like the guy who's 500 in the streets.
00:12:26.48 --> 00:12:27.48 Yeah.
00:12:27.48 --> 00:12:28.48 They come to the MMA gym.
00:12:28.48 --> 00:12:31.68 That guy doesn't work out too well.
00:12:31.68 --> 00:12:37.08 Alright, and obviously I'm abridging this book a little bit, skipping through.
00:12:37.08 --> 00:12:42.40 Here we go back to the book, Men Be Get Good Will in Other Men by Giving It.
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:47.16 They develop courage and they're following mainly as a reflection of the courage, which
00:12:47.16 --> 00:12:50.48 they show in their own action.
00:12:50.48 --> 00:12:56.16 These two qualities of mind and heart are the essence of sound, officer ship.
00:12:56.16 --> 00:13:02.52 One is of little avail without the other and either helps to sustain the other.
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:10.28 So you got goodwill and you got courage and they help each other and they sustain each other.
00:13:10.28 --> 00:13:15.68 Back to the book, as to which is the stronger force in its impact upon the masses of men.
00:13:15.68 --> 00:13:21.28 No truth is more certain than the words once written by William James.
00:13:21.28 --> 00:13:26.76 Evident, though the shortcomings of a man may be, if he is ready to give up his life
00:13:26.76 --> 00:13:30.24 for a cause, we forgive him everything.
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:35.48 However inferior he may be to ourselves and other respects, if we cling to life while
00:13:35.48 --> 00:13:40.88 he throws it away like a flower, we bow to his superiority.
00:13:40.88 --> 00:13:46.04 So I guess courage gets the stronger nod out of that situation.
00:13:46.04 --> 00:13:51.44 Back to the book, Peter Roosevelt once said, if he had a son who refrained from any worthwhile
00:13:51.44 --> 00:13:57.88 action because of the fear of hurt to himself, he would disown him.
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:02.40 Soon after his return to civilian life, General Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke of the
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:06.44 worthy worth whileness of living dangerously.
00:14:06.44 --> 00:14:12.32 On officer of the United States armed forces cannot go far wrong if he holds these ideas.
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:17.52 It is not the suitable profession for those who believe only in digging in and nursing a soft
00:14:17.52 --> 00:14:21.16 snap until death comes at a ripe old age.
00:14:21.16 --> 00:14:24.76 Who risks nothing gains nothing.
00:14:24.76 --> 00:14:31.76 Nor should there be any room in it for professional smugness, small jellacies and undue
00:14:31.76 --> 00:14:36.40 concern about privilege.
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:40.48 So you can't be hiding all the time.
00:14:40.48 --> 00:14:44.64 You got to step up, you got to lead, you got to take some risk, you got to leave dangerously.
00:14:44.64 --> 00:14:49.36 Now of course, young troopers out there, especially guys out on the battlefield, this doesn't
00:14:49.36 --> 00:14:50.84 mean running to your death.
00:14:50.84 --> 00:14:54.08 That's not what it means.
00:14:54.08 --> 00:14:58.40 You will take risk in business world, you'll take risk.
00:14:58.40 --> 00:15:00.48 In the military, you'll take risk.
00:15:00.48 --> 00:15:07.08 If you do either in business or in a military, you take risk stupidly, you'll die or you'll
00:15:07.08 --> 00:15:09.08 lose all your money.
00:15:09.08 --> 00:15:12.36 Neither one of those is good.
00:15:12.36 --> 00:15:18.20 But that doesn't mean you hide and doesn't mean you take no risk and you shy away.
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:23.76 Now the next part, when he's talking about small jellacies and undue concern about privilege,
00:15:23.76 --> 00:15:27.44 this eats people up and destroys people.
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:31.60 And that light here we go back to the book towards services other than his own.
00:15:31.60 --> 00:15:39.32 Any officer is expected to have both a comradly feeling and an imaginative interest.
00:15:39.32 --> 00:15:45.36 Any army officer is a better man for having studied the works of Admiral Mayhand and familiar
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:49.24 lies himself with the modern navy from first-hand experience.
00:15:49.24 --> 00:15:54.08 Those who lead sea going forces can enlarge their own capacities by knowing more rather
00:15:54.08 --> 00:15:58.48 than less about the nature of the air and ground establishments.
00:15:58.48 --> 00:16:03.56 The sub-mariner can always learn something useful to his own work by mingling with airmen.
00:16:03.56 --> 00:16:08.36 The airmen becomes a better officer as he grows in qualified knowledge of ground and
00:16:08.36 --> 00:16:10.60 sea fighting.
00:16:10.60 --> 00:16:12.44 So you've got to learn.
00:16:12.44 --> 00:16:14.000 Working with other industries?
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.64 Learn about those industries.
00:16:15.64 --> 00:16:17.20 Learn as much as you can.
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:21.96 Don't just stay in your own little world because your comfort lesson would happen to
00:16:21.96 --> 00:16:22.96 a lot of us.
00:16:22.96 --> 00:16:25.44 You get comfortable in your own world so that's what you want to stay in.
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:27.08 You don't want to look bad.
00:16:27.08 --> 00:16:28.28 You don't want to appear to be ignorant.
00:16:28.28 --> 00:16:34.28 And Admiral Mayhand is kind of the, well, he was a civil war Admiral as a matter of fact,
00:16:34.28 --> 00:16:40.32 but wrote a book called The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, which the Germans and
00:16:40.32 --> 00:16:43.56 the Japanese both utilized against the whole world, too.
00:16:43.56 --> 00:16:47.60 So a little bit of a little bit of a risk there, but it's also something that guided the
00:16:47.60 --> 00:16:52.64 fought and the building of the modern US Navy.
00:16:52.64 --> 00:16:57.60 Now we talk a little bit about what life is like in the military back to the book.
00:16:57.60 --> 00:17:01.76 The military way is a long, hard road.
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:05.28 And it makes extraordinary requirements of every individual.
00:17:05.28 --> 00:17:11.04 In war, particularly it puts stresses upon men such as they have not known elsewhere.
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:16.64 And the temptation to get out from under would be irresistible if their spirits had not
00:17:16.64 --> 00:17:19.64 been tempered to the ordeal.
00:17:19.64 --> 00:17:20.80 So you got to be ready for the hardest.
00:17:20.80 --> 00:17:24.84 You got to do things in your life that get you ready for the hardness back to the book.
00:17:24.84 --> 00:17:28.52 If nothing but fear, and this is what we're getting to some leadership, if nothing but
00:17:28.52 --> 00:17:35.40 fear of punishments were dependent upon to hold men to the line during extreme trial,
00:17:35.40 --> 00:17:42.80 the result would be wholesale, mutiny, and a situation altogether beyond the control of leadership.
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:45.84 So if the only thing, the only reason that your people are following you because it's
00:17:45.84 --> 00:17:53.28 because of fear of punishment, when the going gets hard, that's not going to work.
00:17:53.28 --> 00:18:00.32 So it must be true that it is the out, that is out of the impact of ideals.
00:18:00.32 --> 00:18:05.32 Out of the impact of ideals, mainly that men develop the strength to face situations,
00:18:05.32 --> 00:18:10.64 which would be normal to run away, which it would be normal to run away.
00:18:10.64 --> 00:18:16.40 So during the normal routine of peace, members of the armed services are expected to respond
00:18:16.40 --> 00:18:21.72 to situations that are more extensive, more complex, then take longer to reach fulfillment
00:18:21.72 --> 00:18:25.88 than the situations to which the majority of men instinctively respond.
00:18:25.88 --> 00:18:29.96 So things in the military take a long time in your big part of that in a peace time,
00:18:29.96 --> 00:18:33.92 big bureaucratic machine, it can be really challenging.
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:40.16 Even the length of the enlistment period looks like a slow march up a 60 mile grade.
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:44.36 The motion is slow, duty frequently, monotonous.
00:18:44.36 --> 00:18:49.84 It is all too easy for the individual to worry about his own insignificance and to feel
00:18:49.84 --> 00:18:53.52 that he has become lost in the crowd.
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:57.000 Now this is something that I hear a lot about on social media.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.96 More people send me messages on this or Facebook messages, I guess, when they feel like
00:19:03.96 --> 00:19:07.36 they're caught in a rut, you know, they're doing their job, they don't really like it.
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:09.000 What should I do?
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.48 And I think this next little section applies to that back to the book, what is the main
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:16.52 test of human character?
00:19:16.52 --> 00:19:24.28 Probably it is this, that a man will know how to be patient in the midst of hard circumstance
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:30.04 and can continue to be personally effective while living through whatever discouragements
00:19:30.04 --> 00:19:34.32 beset him and his companions.
00:19:34.32 --> 00:19:35.88 Can you drive on?
00:19:35.88 --> 00:19:36.88 That's what it's asking.
00:19:36.88 --> 00:19:38.88 Those are the job that you don't like?
00:19:38.88 --> 00:19:39.88 Good.
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:40.88 Good.
00:19:40.88 --> 00:19:42.16 It's a little test.
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:47.12 Now, if you're in a situation that you don't like, you drive on in that situation and
00:19:47.12 --> 00:19:49.32 also you figure out what your exit is going to be.
00:19:49.32 --> 00:19:51.76 Because you don't want to go through life miserable.
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:55.08 You figure out, you start saving your money, you start getting on another education,
00:19:55.08 --> 00:19:57.40 you figure out how to do the job, you get yourself promoted, you do what you've got to
00:19:57.40 --> 00:19:58.40 do.
00:19:58.40 --> 00:20:02.88 But don't let that monotonous job that you're not into that date, don't let that bird
00:20:02.88 --> 00:20:03.88 you down.
00:20:03.88 --> 00:20:04.88 Yeah.
00:20:04.88 --> 00:20:08.88 You drive on in life.
00:20:08.88 --> 00:20:12.88 You don't necessarily have to drive on and keep doing that job.
00:20:12.88 --> 00:20:18.88 You drive on as opposed to, oh, start complaining or going to some thing where you get
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:23.88 self-destruct, ever you see some kind of escapees out later, something like that.
00:20:23.88 --> 00:20:28.28 But I'll tell you, you drive on, you have other options, right?
00:20:28.28 --> 00:20:29.88 You work those other options.
00:20:29.88 --> 00:20:32.88 But whatever it is that your job is and you kick acid that job.
00:20:32.88 --> 00:20:33.88 That's what you do.
00:20:33.88 --> 00:20:36.88 The minute you start slack and you're going backwards, don't do it.
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:38.88 It's not going to be what benefit are you going to get from that.
00:20:38.88 --> 00:20:39.88 You're going to get zero benefit.
00:20:39.88 --> 00:20:41.88 You're going to work your eight hours a day.
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:44.88 You're going to make your $12 an hour.
00:20:44.88 --> 00:20:46.88 Are you going to do it in a slack way?
00:20:46.88 --> 00:20:47.88 Yeah.
00:20:47.88 --> 00:20:49.88 Or are you going to do it in an awesome way?
00:20:49.88 --> 00:20:50.88 Right.
00:20:50.88 --> 00:20:52.88 You know, I'm going to do it in an awesome way.
00:20:52.88 --> 00:20:53.88 Yeah.
00:20:53.88 --> 00:20:54.88 And that's what's going to get you promoted.
00:20:54.88 --> 00:20:55.88 That's what's going to get you.
00:20:55.88 --> 00:20:57.88 That's what's going to get you taking care of.
00:20:57.88 --> 00:20:58.88 In the long run.
00:20:58.88 --> 00:21:02.88 If you, or you, you, like you say this a lot, where you, like you're going to get
00:21:02.88 --> 00:21:05.88 out where you, like even if you're going to do something, even if you don't enjoy, you still
00:21:05.88 --> 00:21:06.88 you do it just the best you can.
00:21:06.88 --> 00:21:08.88 You said that like from the beginning.
00:21:08.88 --> 00:21:15.88 And for someone like me when I look at it like that, of course it sounds like
00:21:15.88 --> 00:21:16.88 good idea.
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:17.88 Do it that way.
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:19.88 But after you do it, you kind of think back.
00:21:19.88 --> 00:21:20.88 And I've done both.
00:21:20.88 --> 00:21:22.88 I've done it where I'm like, well, I hate doing this.
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:26.88 So I'm just going to basically go through the motions until it's finally done.
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:29.88 You know, and I can be relieved or whatever.
00:21:29.88 --> 00:21:34.88 But when you think back of like, hey, remember when I was doing whatever it is that job or
00:21:34.88 --> 00:21:40.88 whatever, when you look back, you kind of have this fulfillment that you did it the best
00:21:40.88 --> 00:21:41.88 you get.
00:21:41.88 --> 00:21:44.88 You never look back and be like, dang, I'm glad I've phoned it in.
00:21:44.88 --> 00:21:47.88 You know, you're always, you're going even if you didn't like it.
00:21:47.88 --> 00:21:51.88 Like you, you're always satisfied that that, yeah, I did it the best that I could.
00:21:51.88 --> 00:21:52.88 So do it.
00:21:52.88 --> 00:21:53.88 Yeah.
00:21:53.88 --> 00:21:55.88 Do it the best you can.
00:21:55.88 --> 00:21:59.88 Now, here's a couple of the lists in this book. Here's another one.
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:06.88 This is the one that's talking about the simple virtues that provide a firm foundation.
00:22:06.88 --> 00:22:08.88 So here we go.
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:10.88 One, a man has honor.
00:22:10.88 --> 00:22:18.88 If he holds himself to a course of conduct because of a conviction that it is in the general interest,
00:22:18.88 --> 00:22:24.88 even though he is well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or
00:22:24.88 --> 00:22:25.88 grave physical risk.
00:22:25.88 --> 00:22:28.88 So when he says general interest, he's talking about like the team.
00:22:28.88 --> 00:22:33.88 So you're going to hold that conviction, even if it's good for the team, you're going to hold that course.
00:22:33.88 --> 00:22:40.88 Even if you're well aware that it may lead to inconvenience, personal loss, humiliation or grave physical risk.
00:22:40.88 --> 00:22:41.88 Boom.
00:22:41.88 --> 00:22:42.88 That's what honor is.
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:44.88 You know, here, honor laid out that well.
00:22:44.88 --> 00:22:45.88 Very often.
00:22:45.88 --> 00:22:47.88 He has veracity.
00:22:47.88 --> 00:22:53.88 If having studied a question to the limit of his ability, he says and believes what he thinks to be true.
00:22:53.88 --> 00:23:01.88 Even though it would be the path of least resistance to deceive others and himself.
00:23:01.88 --> 00:23:04.88 So this is kind of in the same vein.
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:09.88 If you look at something and maybe you don't agree with it, but the easiest thing to do is just be agree with it.
00:23:09.88 --> 00:23:10.88 No, you don't do that.
00:23:10.88 --> 00:23:13.88 You step on saying, no, I don't agree with this.
00:23:13.88 --> 00:23:15.88 Now we could go into detail on that.
00:23:15.88 --> 00:23:22.88 In the time is when you, when you do want to maybe not be the most truthful person in the world.
00:23:22.88 --> 00:23:28.88 For instance, we've talked about this before when your wife is making chicken and it's dry.
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:29.88 Right?
00:23:29.88 --> 00:23:35.88 It might not be the best thing to tell her the amount of water that you're going to need to drink.
00:23:35.88 --> 00:23:42.88 So, but in real things and important things, tell the truth.
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:43.88 Back to the book.
00:23:43.88 --> 00:23:44.88 Number three, he has justice.
00:23:44.88 --> 00:23:51.88 If he acknowledges the interests of all concerned in any particular transaction, rather than serving his own apparent.
00:23:51.88 --> 00:23:53.88 And his own apparent interest.
00:23:53.88 --> 00:23:55.88 Look out for others.
00:23:55.88 --> 00:23:57.88 Number four, he has graciousness.
00:23:57.88 --> 00:24:05.88 If he acts and speaks forthrightly, agrees warmly, disagree fairly and respectfully.
00:24:05.88 --> 00:24:08.88 Participates enthusiastically.
00:24:08.88 --> 00:24:12.88 Refrains from harboring grudges.
00:24:12.88 --> 00:24:19.88 Takes his reverses in stride and does not complain or ask for help in the face of trifling.
00:24:19.88 --> 00:24:23.88 Calamities.
00:24:23.88 --> 00:24:25.88 Those are just solid.
00:24:25.88 --> 00:24:26.88 Those are just solid.
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:27.88 I would say this though.
00:24:27.88 --> 00:24:29.88 Sometimes you got to ask for help.
00:24:29.88 --> 00:24:30.88 Right?
00:24:30.88 --> 00:24:32.88 That's one thing that I wouldn't work with businesses.
00:24:32.88 --> 00:24:37.88 There'll be somebody that's, you know, I'm the extreme ownership and I'm an own this.
00:24:37.88 --> 00:24:40.88 And all of a sudden you realize, hey, you're own in that, but you're not going to be successful at it.
00:24:40.88 --> 00:24:42.88 Because that's too much for you.
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:43.88 You need help.
00:24:43.88 --> 00:24:45.88 You need to, you need to put your ego in check.
00:24:45.88 --> 00:24:48.88 And you need to be able to raise your hand and say, look, I need some help on this.
00:24:48.88 --> 00:24:49.88 I don't have this covered.
00:24:49.88 --> 00:24:50.88 This is too much for me.
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:51.88 I want to expect in this.
00:24:51.88 --> 00:24:52.88 Here's my hands in the air.
00:24:52.88 --> 00:24:53.88 Let me, let me get some help.
00:24:53.88 --> 00:24:56.88 Sometimes seems like it's not necessarily even ego.
00:24:56.88 --> 00:24:59.88 It's more like, oh, I guess it in a way to ego, but it's more like, shoot.
00:24:59.88 --> 00:25:04.88 I don't want to be the guy who has to be dependent on somebody or something like that.
00:25:04.88 --> 00:25:05.88 Like, you know, which is what?
00:25:05.88 --> 00:25:06.88 Extreme ownership.
00:25:06.88 --> 00:25:07.88 Which is ego.
00:25:07.88 --> 00:25:10.88 Actually, if you're the guy that doesn't want to be dependent on other people, that's probably
00:25:10.88 --> 00:25:11.88 ego.
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:16.88 But you are, I think what you're trying to say is that I don't want to be the guy that has to ask for help.
00:25:16.88 --> 00:25:17.88 I want to be the guy that carries my own load.
00:25:17.88 --> 00:25:18.88 Like, you know what?
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:20.88 I'd see this on seal patrols.
00:25:20.88 --> 00:25:27.88 A couple times in my career where guys were overloaded and they didn't want to ask for help.
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:28.88 Right.
00:25:28.88 --> 00:25:29.88 I got this.
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:30.88 Because it's humiliating.
00:25:30.88 --> 00:25:34.88 You know, hey, can you carry my ammunition or hey, can you carry my radio?
00:25:34.88 --> 00:25:35.88 Yeah.
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:36.88 Can you carry my weapon?
00:25:36.88 --> 00:25:39.88 That's, I've seen it happen.
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:42.88 I've carried some extra weapons from time to time.
00:25:42.88 --> 00:25:44.88 It's a bummer, you know?
00:25:44.88 --> 00:25:46.88 And you know what?
00:25:46.88 --> 00:25:47.88 You take the weapon?
00:25:47.88 --> 00:25:50.88 Hey, man, okay, get the water in you.
00:25:50.88 --> 00:25:51.88 You know?
00:25:51.88 --> 00:25:52.88 But that's what you're talking about.
00:25:52.88 --> 00:25:53.88 People don't want to be that guy.
00:25:53.88 --> 00:26:00.88 But what's going to be worse if they don't take a load off and they get heat casualty
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:01.88 and now they're down.
00:26:01.88 --> 00:26:03.88 Well, now we're now I've got to carry him.
00:26:03.88 --> 00:26:05.88 Not this is weapon.
00:26:05.88 --> 00:26:06.88 Which is a bad thing.
00:26:06.88 --> 00:26:07.88 We don't have him anymore.
00:26:07.88 --> 00:26:08.88 Yeah.
00:26:08.88 --> 00:26:09.88 Yeah.
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:10.88 And he can't take a fight.
00:26:10.88 --> 00:26:12.88 He can't even do anything.
00:26:12.88 --> 00:26:16.68 As opposed to the other guy who doesn't know the difference between needing help and
00:26:16.68 --> 00:26:17.68 wanting help.
00:26:17.68 --> 00:26:18.68 Yeah.
00:26:18.68 --> 00:26:19.68 And he knows just like, well help me.
00:26:19.68 --> 00:26:20.68 Yeah.
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:21.68 Because he don't want to work.
00:26:21.68 --> 00:26:24.68 I had a guy who had we were on a long patrol.
00:26:24.68 --> 00:26:27.68 This is back in the day, back in the day.
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:29.68 This is pre-war.
00:26:29.68 --> 00:26:32.68 And my radio meant, because I was a radio man when I was in the city.
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:34.68 And now it wasn't a radio man.
00:26:34.68 --> 00:26:37.68 I was an officer and we were on a long patrol.
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:39.68 And my radio man was going down.
00:26:39.68 --> 00:26:41.68 Like he was, didn't have enough water.
00:26:41.68 --> 00:26:42.68 He was dehydrated.
00:26:42.68 --> 00:26:44.68 And so he was bummed.
00:26:44.68 --> 00:26:48.68 He couldn't keep up with this anymore.
00:26:48.68 --> 00:26:50.68 And I said, OK, let me get you radio.
00:26:50.68 --> 00:26:52.68 So I'm taking a 20 pound radio off his back.
00:26:52.68 --> 00:26:53.68 Put him in my back.
00:26:53.68 --> 00:26:55.68 And I'm carrying it for a little bit, I don't know.
00:26:55.68 --> 00:26:56.68 A half a day.
00:26:56.68 --> 00:26:59.68 And then we get to a, like, a layup point.
00:26:59.68 --> 00:27:01.68 So this is where we're going to first civilian.
00:27:01.68 --> 00:27:03.68 This is where we're going to camp out for the night.
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:07.68 And when we get there, we get a resupply of water and, you know,
00:27:07.68 --> 00:27:08.68 gate or gate or whatever.
00:27:08.68 --> 00:27:11.68 So all of a sudden now everyone's rehydrated.
00:27:11.68 --> 00:27:13.68 And while we're in there, we got to make a community
00:27:13.68 --> 00:27:16.68 and we got to make a communications hit to, you know,
00:27:16.68 --> 00:27:19.68 got to call headquarters and say, hey, this is our location.
00:27:19.68 --> 00:27:25.68 So he comes and takes the radio out of my, out of my backpack.
00:27:25.68 --> 00:27:26.68 You know, it comes over and hit the radio.
00:27:26.68 --> 00:27:27.68 So I can make this communication.
00:27:27.68 --> 00:27:29.68 I go, yeah, cool, open up my bag.
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:30.68 Give it to him.
00:27:30.68 --> 00:27:33.68 And, you know, he makes the radio communications.
00:27:33.68 --> 00:27:36.68 And I'm out doing, like, a reconnaissance of the area to find out what
00:27:36.68 --> 00:27:38.68 wrote we're going to take.
00:27:38.68 --> 00:27:41.68 Anyways, I thought, you know, not his rehydrated.
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:44.68 He's going to take that radio and, you know, we'll be back in the back of the game.
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:49.68 So I come back and when I get back, the radio was sitting on my rock set.
00:27:49.68 --> 00:27:51.68 Oh, my god.
00:27:51.68 --> 00:27:52.68 Oh, my god.
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:53.68 Oh, no.
00:27:53.68 --> 00:27:54.68 But you know what I did?
00:27:54.68 --> 00:27:55.68 Put it back in my rock set.
00:27:55.68 --> 00:27:56.68 I'm scared of it.
00:27:56.68 --> 00:27:57.68 Yeah, you just gotta do it.
00:27:57.68 --> 00:27:59.68 But yeah, so you, you don't want to be that guy.
00:27:59.68 --> 00:28:00.68 Yeah.
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:02.68 Once you get rehydrated, man, get your way back on.
00:28:02.68 --> 00:28:03.68 Yeah.
00:28:03.68 --> 00:28:07.68 That difference between needing help and a one.
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:08.68 Yeah.
00:28:08.68 --> 00:28:09.68 And he did need help.
00:28:09.68 --> 00:28:10.68 Yeah.
00:28:10.68 --> 00:28:13.68 But once the gate of raids come in, you know, you're going to go.
00:28:13.68 --> 00:28:14.68 Yeah.
00:28:14.68 --> 00:28:16.68 You did take that radio back.
00:28:16.68 --> 00:28:21.68 I was, I was a chuckling inside when I saw that radio been placed back on top of my
00:28:21.68 --> 00:28:24.68 Ronin side, but just placed on the, yeah, you got it from here.
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:25.68 Yeah, you put it back in.
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:26.68 Thanks.
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:27.68 And we'll be all good here.
00:28:27.68 --> 00:28:28.68 Awesome.
00:28:28.68 --> 00:28:31.68 Good times and the teams.
00:28:31.68 --> 00:28:35.68 And the last one here, he has integrity.
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:39.68 If his interest in the good of the service is at all times greater than
00:28:39.68 --> 00:28:40.68 his personal pride.
00:28:40.68 --> 00:28:46.68 And when he holds himself to the same line of duty when unobserved as he would follow
00:28:46.68 --> 00:28:50.68 if all his superiors were present.
00:28:50.68 --> 00:28:51.68 This is the classic.
00:28:51.68 --> 00:28:54.68 What do you do when you're not people on a look at me?
00:28:54.68 --> 00:28:58.68 Here's another point.
00:28:58.68 --> 00:29:08.68 The cause of much of the friction in administrative machinery is that at all levels, there are individuals who insist on standing
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:09.68 in their own light.
00:29:09.68 --> 00:29:12.68 Now, this is a term that I actually had to look up standing in your own light.
00:29:12.68 --> 00:29:13.68 It means getting your own way.
00:29:13.68 --> 00:29:17.68 It means you're preventing your, you're preventing your, you're preventing your own success.
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:21.68 And he uses the term of lunch in here, standing in your own light.
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:22.68 This is important.
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:26.68 They believe that there is some special magic.
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:28.68 Some quick springboard to success.
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:37.68 They mistakenly think that it can be won by bootlicking, apple polishing, yesing higher
00:29:37.68 --> 00:29:44.68 authority, playing office politics, throwing weight around, ducking the issue, striving for cheap popularity,
00:29:44.68 --> 00:29:50.68 courting publicity, or seeking any and all means of grabbing the spotlight.
00:29:50.68 --> 00:29:51.68 So this is the guy.
00:29:51.68 --> 00:29:55.68 Everybody that's listening to this podcast right now knows who I'm talking about.
00:29:55.68 --> 00:30:02.68 That guy, that guy that's just always trying to kiss everyone's ass and make himself look good.
00:30:02.68 --> 00:30:05.68 And that's, you know, that's a shortcut, right?
00:30:05.68 --> 00:30:09.68 Marshall saying is a, is a shortcut or a springboard.
00:30:09.68 --> 00:30:12.68 You think it's a quick springboard.
00:30:12.68 --> 00:30:18.68 Back to the book, any one of this set of tricks may enable a man to carry the ball forward, a yard or two,
00:30:18.68 --> 00:30:21.68 in some special situation.
00:30:21.68 --> 00:30:27.68 But at least this comment can be made without qualification of the men who have risen to supreme heights in the fighting
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:32.68 establishment of the United States and have had their greatness proclaimed by their fellow
00:30:32.68 --> 00:30:38.68 countrymen. There is not one career which provides any warrant for the conclusion that there is a special
00:30:38.68 --> 00:30:43.68 shortcut known only to this smart operators.
00:30:43.68 --> 00:30:50.68 Too enough, a few men have gained fairly high rank by dint of what late Mr. Justice Holmes called the
00:30:50.68 --> 00:30:56.68 instinct for the jugular, a feeling of wind to jump and wear to press and how to slash in order to achieve
00:30:56.68 --> 00:31:00.68 somewhat predatory personal ends.
00:31:00.68 --> 00:31:05.68 That will occasionally happen in any walk-a life. And I say this all the time, I've said this on this podcast.
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:09.68 But if you got that guy that we're talking about, sometimes they're going to get a better recommendation.
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:13.68 You, but sometimes they're going to get, they're going to get that promotion that you were wanting and you,
00:31:13.68 --> 00:31:17.68 you just, you just held the line and were a good person. That person took the credit for something and no one really
00:31:17.68 --> 00:31:19.68 realized next thing, you know, they get the promotion.
00:31:19.68 --> 00:31:25.68 But I agree with what's being said here, that does happen sometimes in every walk of life, but in the long run,
00:31:25.68 --> 00:31:27.68 that person's going down.
00:31:27.68 --> 00:31:32.68 That person's going down in the long run. And the more you kind of depend on that sort of thing,
00:31:32.68 --> 00:31:38.68 the less likely for any kind of success. And you absolutely, yeah, yeah.
00:31:38.68 --> 00:31:45.68 And he says here, but from Washington, Wayne and Jones down to Eisenhower, Van Degriff and
00:31:45.68 --> 00:31:52.68 Nimitz, the best, the men best loved by the American people for their military successes were also the men with
00:31:52.68 --> 00:31:59.68 greatness of soul.
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:05.68 During World War II, there were quite a few higher commanders relieved in our forces, because
00:32:05.68 --> 00:32:10.68 it was judged for one reason or another that they had failed in battle. So relieved means you got fired.
00:32:10.68 --> 00:32:16.68 Of the total number, there were a few who took a reduction in rank, went willingly to a lower post
00:32:16.68 --> 00:32:23.68 in a fighting command. Other, no complaint kept their chins up, worked courageously and sympathetically with their commands,
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:28.68 and provided an example of manhood that all who saw them will never forget.
00:32:28.68 --> 00:32:32.68 So if you get, I get asked this, I've got, I've got, been asked this a couple times. I got demoted.
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:38.68 Or sometimes not demoted, but I got passed over, you know, someone else got promoted instead of me, what should I do?
00:32:38.68 --> 00:32:41.68 Get after it. That's what these guys did.
00:32:41.68 --> 00:32:44.68 That's what these guys did. Hey, screwed up. You know what? Check.
00:32:44.68 --> 00:32:49.68 All right, cool. Let's, let's, here's what I messed up. That was my fault. I'm ready to rock and roll. You put me down.
00:32:49.68 --> 00:32:53.68 Put me in charge of less people. I got it. I'm going to do well.
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:59.68 Though their names need not be mentioned, they were imprinted with the real virtue of the services,
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:03.68 even more deeply than many of their colleagues who had no blemishes on their records.
00:33:03.68 --> 00:33:06.68 Their character had met the ultimate test.
00:33:06.68 --> 00:33:12.68 The men who had the privilege of working close to them realized this and the supply,
00:33:12.68 --> 00:33:17.68 the supply, my effect of his personal influence helped strengthen the resolve of many others.
00:33:17.68 --> 00:33:21.68 So it's actually inspirational to people around you when they see that.
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:27.68 And there's been many guys that I'm known that it bounced back for some kind of, from some kind of, you know, career problem.
00:33:27.68 --> 00:33:31.68 They mess something up. They got, they got fired.
00:33:31.68 --> 00:33:35.68 And they take it. They be humble about it. And they come back and turn it around.
00:33:35.68 --> 00:33:41.68 The person that complains and thinks that they're a victim, not going to work out for them.
00:33:41.68 --> 00:33:44.68 That's an, in the civilian sector and in the military sector.
00:33:44.68 --> 00:33:46.68 Now,
00:33:46.68 --> 00:33:50.68 Let's start talking a little bit about being a recruit.
00:33:50.68 --> 00:33:57.68 And the kind of the mental training, the mindset training that happens as a recruit to the book,
00:33:57.68 --> 00:34:00.68 his perseverance and the care of weapons,
00:34:00.68 --> 00:34:03.68 in keeping his living quarters orderly,
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:07.68 and in doing his full share of work is best ensured,
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:17.68 not through fear of punishments, but by stimulating his belief that any other way of going is unworthy of a member of a fighting service.
00:34:17.68 --> 00:34:28.68 Precision in personal habits, precision in drill and precision in daily living are the high road to that kind of discipline,
00:34:28.68 --> 00:34:36.68 which best ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.
00:34:36.68 --> 00:34:41.68 I can tell you,
00:34:41.68 --> 00:34:43.68 Yeah,
00:34:43.68 --> 00:34:44.68 You know,
00:34:44.68 --> 00:34:49.68 it's just, it's basically he's talking about the, the unmedicated daily discipline and all things.
00:34:49.68 --> 00:34:50.68 That's what it is.
00:34:50.68 --> 00:34:55.68 And that ensures cool and collected thought and unity of action on the field of battle.
00:34:55.68 --> 00:34:57.68 Like I'm not going to say about that other than yes,
00:34:57.68 --> 00:34:59.68 Amen.
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:03.68 Here's another little section.
00:35:03.68 --> 00:35:06.68 When men are well led,
00:35:06.68 --> 00:35:13.68 they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.
00:35:13.68 --> 00:35:15.68 Let's think about that.
00:35:15.68 --> 00:35:17.68 When men are well led,
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:24.68 they become fully receptive to the whole body of ideas which their leaders see fit to put before them.
00:35:24.68 --> 00:35:28.68 So what we're talking about here is when somebody's a good leader,
00:35:28.68 --> 00:35:30.68 the the troopers around them,
00:35:30.68 --> 00:35:32.68 the people that are working for them,
00:35:32.68 --> 00:35:36.68 they start to believe the whole body everything,
00:35:36.68 --> 00:35:37.68 right?
00:35:37.68 --> 00:35:39.68 They start to believe everything that you're saying.
00:35:39.68 --> 00:35:41.68 And that's powerful.
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:42.68 That's obviously powerful.
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:46.68 Yeah, it kind of goes back to like what you're saying about like if you're,
00:35:46.68 --> 00:35:48.68 if they fear your punishment,
00:35:48.68 --> 00:35:49.68 that's how you lead you know,
00:35:49.68 --> 00:35:50.68 I'm just,
00:35:50.68 --> 00:35:51.68 and they fear the punishment.
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:54.68 So they're going to do enough to not get punished,
00:35:54.68 --> 00:35:57.68 but they won't do anything that they don't have to.
00:35:57.68 --> 00:35:58.68 Yeah.
00:35:58.68 --> 00:36:00.68 So it's only what they have to do.
00:36:00.68 --> 00:36:02.68 So you won't get people doing their best.
00:36:02.68 --> 00:36:04.68 You know, I mean, so.
00:36:04.68 --> 00:36:05.68 Yeah.
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:05.68 Yeah.
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:08.68 And that that punishment piece that I kind of breathed through is,
00:36:08.68 --> 00:36:10.68 is not through fear of punishments,
00:36:10.68 --> 00:36:13.68 but by stimulating is belief that any other way.
00:36:13.68 --> 00:36:15.68 So that's 100% right.
00:36:15.68 --> 00:36:16.68 And we just, you know, I say at all time,
00:36:16.68 --> 00:36:17.68 if you,
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:17.68 if you,
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:17.68 if you're,
00:36:17.68 --> 00:36:19.68 if you're doing what you told them to do just because they're afraid of you,
00:36:19.68 --> 00:36:20.68 sure,
00:36:20.68 --> 00:36:21.68 you can get,
00:36:21.68 --> 00:36:22.68 that's going to work for a little while,
00:36:22.68 --> 00:36:22.68 you know,
00:36:22.68 --> 00:36:23.68 oh,
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:23.68 I'll fire you.
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:24.68 Okay.
00:36:24.68 --> 00:36:25.68 What's that person doing when we get to him,
00:36:25.68 --> 00:36:26.68 putting his,
00:36:26.68 --> 00:36:28.68 putting his resume on monster.com,
00:36:28.68 --> 00:36:29.68 looking for another job.
00:36:29.68 --> 00:36:30.68 So that's not to get fired.
00:36:30.68 --> 00:36:31.68 If you're not doing it,
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:32.68 but that's not to get fired is,
00:36:32.68 --> 00:36:33.68 is.
00:36:34.68 --> 00:36:35.68 Alright.
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:36.68 Going back to the book,
00:36:36.68 --> 00:36:37.68 Vowage has been said before,
00:36:37.68 --> 00:36:39.68 even so it can be said again.
00:36:39.68 --> 00:36:43.68 It is paramount and overriding responsibility of every officer to take care of his men before,
00:36:43.68 --> 00:36:45.68 caring for himself.
00:36:45.68 --> 00:36:50.68 Yet many junior officers do not seem to understand that steadfast,
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:54.68 steadfast fidelity to it is required,
00:36:54.68 --> 00:36:56.68 not lip service.
00:36:56.68 --> 00:36:58.68 And of this,
00:36:58.68 --> 00:37:00.68 as Admiral Mahan would say,
00:37:00.68 --> 00:37:01.68 man would say,
00:37:01.68 --> 00:37:03.68 comes much evil.
00:37:03.68 --> 00:37:07.68 The loyalty of men simply cannot be commanded
00:37:07.68 --> 00:37:08.68 when they become
00:37:08.68 --> 00:37:12.68 in biddered by selfish action.
00:37:12.68 --> 00:37:13.68 So a minute,
00:37:13.68 --> 00:37:16.68 your troops see that you're being selfish,
00:37:16.68 --> 00:37:17.68 or you're doing this for yourself.
00:37:17.68 --> 00:37:19.68 That's the beginning of,
00:37:19.68 --> 00:37:20.68 but what he says,
00:37:20.68 --> 00:37:23.68 Admiral Mahan says much evil.
00:37:23.68 --> 00:37:25.68 He says evil comes from that.
00:37:25.68 --> 00:37:26.68 When you start acting selfishly as a leader,
00:37:26.68 --> 00:37:27.68 evil comes from that.
00:37:27.68 --> 00:37:29.68 If an officer is on a tour with an enlisted man,
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:30.68 he takes care of the man,
00:37:30.68 --> 00:37:31.68 he takes care of the man,
00:37:31.68 --> 00:37:33.68 he takes care that the man is accommodated as to food,
00:37:33.68 --> 00:37:34.68 shelter medical treatment,
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:38.68 or other prime needs before satisfying his own wants.
00:37:38.68 --> 00:37:40.68 If that means that the last meal,
00:37:40.68 --> 00:37:42.68 or the last bed is gone,
00:37:42.68 --> 00:37:44.68 his duty is to get along the hard way,
00:37:44.68 --> 00:37:46.68 boom.
00:37:46.68 --> 00:37:48.68 Take care of your people.
00:37:48.68 --> 00:38:02.68 Now, again, this is written in 1950,
00:38:02.68 --> 00:38:04.68 but even in 1950,
00:38:04.68 --> 00:38:06.68 you might think this is the hard post-war of the war.
00:38:06.68 --> 00:38:09.68 Two, chapter eight is actually called
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:12.68 getting along with people.
00:38:12.68 --> 00:38:13.68 Boom.
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:15.68 Now, here's a real,
00:38:15.68 --> 00:38:17.68 some of this stuff is so simple.
00:38:17.68 --> 00:38:18.68 So obvious.
00:38:18.68 --> 00:38:21.68 It's so simple and so obvious that they had to write a book about it,
00:38:21.68 --> 00:38:23.68 so that people could do it because we all failed to do it.
00:38:23.68 --> 00:38:24.68 So here we go.
00:38:24.68 --> 00:38:26.68 If you like people,
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:30.68 if you seek contact with them rather than hiding yourself in a corner,
00:38:30.68 --> 00:38:33.68 if you study your fellow men sympathetically,
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:39.68 if you try consistently to contribute to something to this success and happiness,
00:38:39.68 --> 00:38:42.68 or contribute something to their success and happiness,
00:38:42.68 --> 00:38:46.68 if you are reasonably generous with your thoughts and your time,
00:38:46.68 --> 00:38:50.68 if you have a partial reserve with everyone,
00:38:50.68 --> 00:38:54.68 but a seeming reserve with no one.
00:38:54.68 --> 00:39:00.68 If you work to be interesting rather than spend to be a good fellow,
00:39:00.68 --> 00:39:02.68 you will get along with your sub-erears,
00:39:02.68 --> 00:39:03.68 your sub-ordinates,
00:39:03.68 --> 00:39:05.68 your orderly, your roommate,
00:39:05.68 --> 00:39:07.68 and the human race.
00:39:07.68 --> 00:39:08.68 That's it.
00:39:08.68 --> 00:39:09.68 That's all you got.
00:39:09.68 --> 00:39:10.68 If you want to get along with everybody,
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:12.68 now one of the ones that I,
00:39:12.68 --> 00:39:13.68 you know,
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:14.68 these are all pretty obvious,
00:39:14.68 --> 00:39:15.68 but one of the ones,
00:39:15.68 --> 00:39:18.68 if you have a partial reserve with everyone,
00:39:18.68 --> 00:39:21.68 but a seeming reserve with no one.
00:39:21.68 --> 00:39:24.68 So what that means is you're not just flying off the handle.
00:39:24.68 --> 00:39:26.68 You're just reserved a little bit.
00:39:26.68 --> 00:39:28.68 You're just, you show restraint,
00:39:28.68 --> 00:39:31.68 but the restraint doesn't come across as a loophonist,
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:32.68 right?
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:33.68 It's not so much,
00:39:33.68 --> 00:39:33.68 you know,
00:39:33.68 --> 00:39:34.68 if I come into a room,
00:39:34.68 --> 00:39:35.68 and I'm going to show restraint,
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:37.68 so I'm not going to say hi to you,
00:39:37.68 --> 00:39:40.68 I'm going to come across as a loof and you're not going to like me.
00:39:40.68 --> 00:39:41.68 But if I,
00:39:41.68 --> 00:39:44.68 but if I was a walkin' to go echo my brother, give me a hug.
00:39:44.68 --> 00:39:46.68 Well, you're not going to like me either.
00:39:46.68 --> 00:39:47.68 Well I,
00:39:47.68 --> 00:39:47.68 well I,
00:39:47.68 --> 00:39:49.68 well you're one of the few people.
00:39:49.68 --> 00:39:50.68 Well that's the Hawaiian in you.
00:39:50.68 --> 00:39:51.68 A lohospiro.
00:39:51.68 --> 00:39:52.68 Let's hear it.
00:39:52.68 --> 00:39:53.68 You know?
00:39:53.68 --> 00:39:54.68 So,
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:55.68 so it's,
00:39:55.68 --> 00:39:58.68 it's that measured reserve that measure restraint,
00:39:58.68 --> 00:40:00.68 that balance is a little bit back out of me there.
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:01.68 So I gotta find the good,
00:40:01.68 --> 00:40:03.68 good spot in the middle.
00:40:03.68 --> 00:40:05.68 Again,
00:40:05.68 --> 00:40:07.68 getting along with people,
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:08.68 back to the book,
00:40:08.68 --> 00:40:13.84 scores of thousands, precepts, and platitudes have been written for the guidance of personal
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:15.92 conduct.
00:40:15.92 --> 00:40:21.64 The odd part is that, despite all of this labor, most of the frictions in modern society
00:40:21.64 --> 00:40:25.96 arise from the individuals feeling of inferiority.
00:40:25.96 --> 00:40:34.32 His false pride, his vanity, his unwillingness to yield space to any other man.
00:40:34.32 --> 00:40:36.44 Unwillingness to yield space to any of them.
00:40:36.44 --> 00:40:41.84 And I get hit on this one a lot because, again, because of my personality can be a little
00:40:41.84 --> 00:40:43.000 bit forceful.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.56 People think I'm just no compromise.
00:40:45.56 --> 00:40:47.16 My way or the highway.
00:40:47.16 --> 00:40:48.40 And this is what they're talking about.
00:40:48.40 --> 00:40:49.72 I'm not like that.
00:40:49.72 --> 00:40:51.80 I'm open to suggestions.
00:40:51.80 --> 00:40:53.84 I'm willing to say, you know what, that's a better idea.
00:40:53.84 --> 00:40:54.84 Or you know what?
00:40:54.84 --> 00:40:55.84 I like your idea.
00:40:55.84 --> 00:40:57.04 Could we make this adjustment to it?
00:40:57.04 --> 00:41:01.24 Or yes, I can change my idea to fit with what you're saying, because it makes sense.
00:41:01.24 --> 00:41:05.12 People that don't do that have unwillingness to yield space to any other man.
00:41:05.12 --> 00:41:13.16 And continuing on and his consequent urge to throw his own weight around.
00:41:13.16 --> 00:41:14.32 Right?
00:41:14.32 --> 00:41:17.56 These are just ways to not get along with people and speaking of ways to get not
00:41:17.56 --> 00:41:18.88 get along with people.
00:41:18.88 --> 00:41:21.56 Here's the 13 mistakes.
00:41:21.56 --> 00:41:23.04 The 13 mistakes.
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:27.64 This is from the United States Coast Guard magazine.
00:41:27.64 --> 00:41:28.64 13 pitfalls.
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:29.64 Here we go.
00:41:29.64 --> 00:41:35.000 One to attempt to set up your own personal, to attempt to set up your own standard of
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.76 right and wrong.
00:41:37.76 --> 00:41:46.16 To try to measure the enjoyment of others by your own, to expect uniformity of opinions in
00:41:46.16 --> 00:41:51.20 the world, to fail to make allowance for inexperience.
00:41:51.20 --> 00:41:53.12 It's a good one.
00:41:53.12 --> 00:42:02.32 To endeavor to mold all dispositions alike, not to yield on an important trifles, same
00:42:02.32 --> 00:42:03.32 thing we just heard.
00:42:03.32 --> 00:42:08.16 The things that don't matter who cares, let the guys do what they're going to do on
00:42:08.16 --> 00:42:10.32 that.
00:42:10.32 --> 00:42:14.16 To look for perfection in our own actions.
00:42:14.16 --> 00:42:19.88 To worry ourselves and others about what can't be remedied.
00:42:19.88 --> 00:42:22.28 Why you worried about that can't change it?
00:42:22.28 --> 00:42:23.68 Let's not worry about it.
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:27.16 Let's just move on.
00:42:27.16 --> 00:42:33.76 Here's a big one, not to help everybody, wherever, however, whenever we can.
00:42:33.76 --> 00:42:34.76 That's a big ask.
00:42:34.76 --> 00:42:36.40 That's a big request.
00:42:36.40 --> 00:42:38.84 Now, you know what I want you to do in your life?
00:42:38.84 --> 00:42:43.24 Help everybody, however, wherever and whenever you can.
00:42:43.24 --> 00:42:44.24 That's asking a lot.
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:47.56 That's a big one.
00:42:47.56 --> 00:42:51.48 To consider impossible what we cannot ourselves perform.
00:42:51.48 --> 00:42:54.40 I can't even do that.
00:42:54.40 --> 00:43:00.64 To believe only what our finite minds can grasp.
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:06.36 Must say that one again, to believe only what our finite minds can grasp.
00:43:06.36 --> 00:43:07.88 That's humility.
00:43:07.88 --> 00:43:11.28 To recognize that you don't understand everything in the world.
00:43:11.28 --> 00:43:13.92 I don't understand everything in the world.
00:43:13.92 --> 00:43:15.80 It's okay.
00:43:15.80 --> 00:43:17.60 There's things beyond my comprehension.
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:18.80 That's okay.
00:43:18.80 --> 00:43:21.88 You got to admit to that.
00:43:21.88 --> 00:43:27.88 You got to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.
00:43:27.88 --> 00:43:38.28 To estimate by some outside quality when it is that within, which makes the man.
00:43:38.28 --> 00:43:41.48 So, very simple.
00:43:41.48 --> 00:43:48.000 Interesting how you can make allowances for our according to the 13 things.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.68 You can make allowances for inexperience.
00:43:50.68 --> 00:43:52.96 But not the weakness of others.
00:43:52.96 --> 00:43:56.16 No, it says not to make.
00:43:56.16 --> 00:43:57.16 This would be a mistake.
00:43:57.16 --> 00:44:00.08 It would be a mistake not to make allowances for the weaknesses of others.
00:44:00.08 --> 00:44:01.60 Also, he said, okay, next to like.
00:44:01.60 --> 00:44:06.80 You got to just say, this guy's, you know, I got to make allowances.
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:07.80 Flex a little bit.
00:44:07.80 --> 00:44:14.04 He's got to fight off the handle.
00:44:14.04 --> 00:44:15.04 Back to the book.
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:21.96 I used to say that when any officer has the inexcusable fault that he takes snap judgment
00:44:21.96 --> 00:44:28.16 on his own men, he will not be any different in his relations with all other people.
00:44:28.16 --> 00:44:31.36 And we'll stand in his own light for the duration of his career again.
00:44:31.36 --> 00:44:32.48 There's that term.
00:44:32.48 --> 00:44:40.56 If you're making snap judgments of people, you're not going to do them justice.
00:44:40.56 --> 00:44:43.72 And that's something that I always very careful about because I've talked about it before
00:44:43.72 --> 00:44:44.96 in the SEAL teams.
00:44:44.96 --> 00:44:47.84 Your reputation is very, very important.
00:44:47.84 --> 00:44:53.16 And everybody that's done something stupid in the SEAL teams, every single person knows it.
00:44:53.16 --> 00:44:59.04 I mean, at a high level of stupidity, if you do something really stupid, everybody knows
00:44:59.04 --> 00:45:00.04 about it.
00:45:00.04 --> 00:45:02.88 And then minor stupid things, a lot of people will know about it.
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:06.12 And so you develop a reputation over time.
00:45:06.12 --> 00:45:11.88 And it's very easy to fall in that category of all iron disguise, you know, kind of a
00:45:11.88 --> 00:45:15.08 turd or whatever, and not give them a chance.
00:45:15.08 --> 00:45:18.12 But I always, I always try to give people a chance and say, okay, let me see what this
00:45:18.12 --> 00:45:19.60 guy's really like.
00:45:19.60 --> 00:45:21.88 And I guess I would take a little personal challenge if it was a guy that was going
00:45:21.88 --> 00:45:24.04 to be working for me.
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:25.80 Let's see if I can make this guy rock and roll.
00:45:25.80 --> 00:45:30.000 You know, let me see if I can make this guy into a solid seal.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000 Can't always pull it off.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.16 But sometimes you can't just need that second chance.
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:38.72 Some people go too far with the mistakes that they made, don't they don't get a second
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:41.72 chance?
00:45:41.72 --> 00:45:43.56 Okay, we've talked about this before.
00:45:43.56 --> 00:45:45.04 Let's talk about it again.
00:45:45.04 --> 00:45:46.04 Here we go.
00:45:46.04 --> 00:45:51.72 The man who will not listen never develops whits enough to distinguish between a bore and
00:45:51.72 --> 00:45:56.68 a sage and therefore cannot pick the best company.
00:45:56.68 --> 00:46:03.16 The vacant stare, the drifting of eyes from the speaker to a window or a picture or a passing
00:46:03.16 --> 00:46:10.64 blonde, though greatly tempting in the midst of long discourse are taken only as signs of
00:46:10.64 --> 00:46:12.96 inattention.
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:17.28 Many young officer called to the carpet for some trivial business as managed to square
00:46:17.28 --> 00:46:22.04 himself with his commander just by looking straight and talking straight in the few moments
00:46:22.04 --> 00:46:24.40 that decided his future.
00:46:24.40 --> 00:46:27.60 So I guess this might be something that didn't make the politically correct version.
00:46:27.60 --> 00:46:31.96 If your eyes are wandering on a passing blonde, why do I have this conversation?
00:46:31.96 --> 00:46:37.000 So that might be one of those things where they changed that for the 2007 edition.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000 Like what?
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000 Like that's show, show vines.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.84 It's a good show vines, stick.
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:43.64 It's a blonde, it didn't say girl.
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:47.52 Okay, well maybe good point, maybe it's like racial.
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:49.52 Anti brown hair to people.
00:46:49.52 --> 00:46:50.52 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:50.52 --> 00:46:53.36 Too bad.
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:54.72 And this is important, though.
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:57.80 You go into talking to your in trouble.
00:46:57.80 --> 00:47:01.16 You get there, look straight and talk straight for a few minutes with the boss.
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:02.44 Hey, this boss is what happened.
00:47:02.44 --> 00:47:04.56 This is what I did, this is mistakes I made.
00:47:04.56 --> 00:47:09.68 That's got infinitely better chance of you recovering from that situation as when you
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:10.68 go in there.
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:13.08 Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
00:47:13.08 --> 00:47:14.16 Don't be that guy.
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:17.92 Don't be that guy.
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:22.56 Elsewhere in the book, a great deal has been said about the importance of the voice and
00:47:22.56 --> 00:47:25.76 of developing ones, powers of conversation.
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:31.60 Not a great deal needs to be added there, but there's no excuse for the officer who talks
00:47:31.60 --> 00:47:35.52 so that others must strain to hear what he is saying.
00:47:35.52 --> 00:47:40.52 Unless he is suffering from Laryn Jydus, it is simple enough to keep the chin up and let
00:47:40.52 --> 00:47:42.56 the words roll out.
00:47:42.56 --> 00:47:47.80 Many persons have the bad habit of letting the voice drop at the end of a sentence.
00:47:47.80 --> 00:47:54.80 The effect on the other party is like watching a man run away from a fight.
00:47:54.80 --> 00:47:57.84 Notice I said fight really loud because I didn't want to be the guy that was dropping
00:47:57.84 --> 00:47:58.84 off on the end of a sentence.
00:47:58.84 --> 00:47:59.84 Right.
00:47:59.84 --> 00:48:05.24 What about speaking and how you speak and speaking clearly and not mumbling and not fading
00:48:05.24 --> 00:48:08.68 off on the end of your words?
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:12.48 This thing is a gold-minded book actually.
00:48:12.48 --> 00:48:16.92 This should be issued to 13 year olds nationwide in my opinion.
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:20.84 Maybe we could start a campaign to make that happen.
00:48:20.84 --> 00:48:21.84 Good.
00:48:21.84 --> 00:48:23.20 Back to the book.
00:48:23.20 --> 00:48:27.76 Carefulness in the little things count much.
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:31.92 And develop an aversion to the individual who cannot remember their names.
00:48:31.92 --> 00:48:33.96 Their titles or their stations.
00:48:33.96 --> 00:48:39.28 But they will warm to the person who remembers and they will overlook most of his other
00:48:39.28 --> 00:48:41.28 shortcomings.
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.56 Likewise, they are won by any words of appreciation or of interest in what they're doing.
00:48:46.56 --> 00:48:49.84 So again, how we get along with other people?
00:48:49.84 --> 00:48:50.84 Remember their name.
00:48:50.84 --> 00:48:52.52 I know about it and that's hard.
00:48:52.52 --> 00:48:54.44 You know, that's hard.
00:48:54.44 --> 00:48:55.44 There's tricks for that.
00:48:55.44 --> 00:48:56.44 Yeah.
00:48:56.44 --> 00:48:58.000 See, you need tricks for it even.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.68 I mean, I'm nothing everyone needs, but I'm just saying it.
00:49:01.68 --> 00:49:03.68 It's understood that that's hard.
00:49:03.68 --> 00:49:07.68 And there's tricks out there because people know that that can be hard.
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:09.08 And they also know that it's impactful.
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:10.08 Yeah.
00:49:10.08 --> 00:49:11.08 It's impactful.
00:49:11.08 --> 00:49:12.08 Hammer.
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:15.28 But you forget a guy's name literally two seconds after each of us.
00:49:15.28 --> 00:49:19.000 Unless you make it a point to command yourself to remember it.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000 Right.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000 That's tricky.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000 Yeah.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000 It's tricky.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.76 I knew a guy that was a really good leader.
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:28.88 And he would go into a room of 25 people.
00:49:28.88 --> 00:49:31.000 And he would go over the top.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.04 And when he got done, he would say, I know all your names now.
00:49:34.04 --> 00:49:35.04 Yeah.
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:36.04 You go name every single one of them.
00:49:36.04 --> 00:49:37.04 Yeah, Henry does that sometimes.
00:49:37.04 --> 00:49:38.04 It's pretty interesting.
00:49:38.04 --> 00:49:39.04 Yeah.
00:49:39.04 --> 00:49:40.04 That's legit.
00:49:40.04 --> 00:49:41.84 I bet Henry's got some little trick to do it.
00:49:41.84 --> 00:49:42.84 Yeah.
00:49:42.84 --> 00:49:45.48 You remember, you know, your name is Echo.
00:49:45.48 --> 00:49:46.48 Cool.
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:48.52 I look at you and I see big E on your face.
00:49:48.52 --> 00:49:49.52 Right.
00:49:49.52 --> 00:49:50.52 Right.
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:51.52 Now I'm amazing.
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:52.52 Yeah.
00:49:52.52 --> 00:49:53.52 Yeah.
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:54.52 That's interesting.
00:49:54.52 --> 00:49:56.32 I want to remember one guy.
00:49:56.32 --> 00:49:58.68 I'm going to make it a point to remember this guy's name.
00:49:58.68 --> 00:49:59.96 He'll be like, hey, my name's John.
00:49:59.96 --> 00:50:04.000 You'd be like, hey, Josh, but you'll forget it quick sometimes.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.56 It's weird, man.
00:50:05.56 --> 00:50:06.56 Not good.
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:07.56 Got to remember those names.
00:50:07.56 --> 00:50:08.56 Got to lock them in.
00:50:08.56 --> 00:50:11.32 I think if you take a certain amount of pride in doing that,
00:50:11.32 --> 00:50:12.32 I think that helps a lot.
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:13.32 Step number one.
00:50:13.32 --> 00:50:14.32 Yeah.
00:50:14.32 --> 00:50:15.52 Take pride in your job.
00:50:15.52 --> 00:50:16.52 Okay.
00:50:16.52 --> 00:50:17.52 I'm going to try that.
00:50:17.52 --> 00:50:18.52 Now this is interesting.
00:50:18.52 --> 00:50:20.52 A little dig here.
00:50:20.52 --> 00:50:23.16 It's actually kind of funny.
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:26.36 He's basically going back and saying that all this information about getting along
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:27.36 with other people.
00:50:27.36 --> 00:50:31.40 He's saying he's kind of recapping the whole thing to close it out.
00:50:31.40 --> 00:50:32.40 Back to the book.
00:50:32.40 --> 00:50:34.84 It isn't lengthy advice which is needed on this subject.
00:50:34.84 --> 00:50:39.28 Since a man commissioned is considered to have graduated from at least the kindergarten
00:50:39.28 --> 00:50:41.08 of good manners.
00:50:41.08 --> 00:50:47.000 What counts is simply caring about it and not to be ingratiating to other people,
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.64 but for the sake of one's own dignity and self-respect.
00:50:51.64 --> 00:50:56.60 One of the oracles on winning friends and influencing people have said it in those
00:50:56.60 --> 00:50:57.88 few words.
00:50:57.88 --> 00:51:01.36 And if they had, there would have been no books to sell.
00:51:01.36 --> 00:51:07.40 So there's a little shot, little shot on winning friends and influencing people.
00:51:07.40 --> 00:51:09.04 Wait, when was that one right then?
00:51:09.04 --> 00:51:10.04 Oh, that was written.
00:51:10.04 --> 00:51:12.28 I don't know where the date dates, but that's written a long time ago.
00:51:12.28 --> 00:51:13.28 Dang.
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:14.28 Yeah.
00:51:14.28 --> 00:51:15.28 Some of you have time to read that.
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:16.28 No, that's turn of the century.
00:51:16.28 --> 00:51:17.28 Fold school.
00:51:17.28 --> 00:51:18.28 Yeah.
00:51:18.28 --> 00:51:20.28 Old school.
00:51:20.28 --> 00:51:24.68 Talking about, no, we're going to leader leaders and leadership.
00:51:24.68 --> 00:51:27.72 And what type of men are leaders?
00:51:27.72 --> 00:51:32.40 Those who come forward to fill these same places and to command them with equal or greater
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:36.04 authority and competence will not be plastered saints.
00:51:36.04 --> 00:51:40.28 So if you remember in the beginning, he goes on this thing about how you're not going
00:51:40.28 --> 00:51:43.16 to swear and you're going to be not going to talk about women.
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:45.80 He's given some leeway now to that.
00:51:45.80 --> 00:51:51.48 Saying they're not going to be plastered saints laden with all human virtue, spotless and
00:51:51.48 --> 00:51:59.40 character and fit to be anointed with a Superman legend by some future person weems.
00:51:59.40 --> 00:52:05.32 They will be men with a human quality and a strong belief in the United States and the goodness
00:52:05.32 --> 00:52:08.76 of a free society.
00:52:08.76 --> 00:52:14.64 They will have some of the average man's faults and maybe a few of his vices.
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:20.76 But certainly they will possess the qualities of courage, creative intelligence and physical
00:52:20.76 --> 00:52:27.20 fitness in more than average measure.
00:52:27.20 --> 00:52:32.40 So again, it's not quite as strict as he laid out in the beginning.
00:52:32.40 --> 00:52:36.84 Yeah, because it's like, remember I'm trying, you watch training day?
00:52:36.84 --> 00:52:39.28 Remember that Denzel and I saw a part of it.
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:44.60 Yeah, so there's a little concept is in there where he said, you got to have a
00:52:44.60 --> 00:52:47.80 little dirt on you so they can trust you.
00:52:47.80 --> 00:52:48.80 Okay.
00:52:48.80 --> 00:52:53.64 So basically, if you speak clean, well, yeah, there's all kinds of heroes that are not
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:54.64 squeaky clean.
00:52:54.64 --> 00:52:58.04 Well, in all kinds of leaders that Denzel, I would say there's more heroes that aren't
00:52:58.04 --> 00:52:59.04 squeaky clean.
00:52:59.04 --> 00:53:02.32 Yeah, there are real purpose plenty of leaders that aren't squeaky clean and they're
00:53:02.32 --> 00:53:03.32 great leaders.
00:53:03.32 --> 00:53:04.32 Yeah.
00:53:04.32 --> 00:53:06.16 And that's what they're given that up in this book.
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:08.32 It's saying look, not going to be a plaster saint.
00:53:08.32 --> 00:53:09.32 It'll be a person.
00:53:09.32 --> 00:53:10.32 Gonna have faults.
00:53:10.32 --> 00:53:12.92 But if we can say, gonna have vices, gonna have dirt.
00:53:12.92 --> 00:53:13.92 Yeah.
00:53:13.92 --> 00:53:17.76 For the record, the training day guys were all cropped.
00:53:17.76 --> 00:53:19.96 That's a little bit of an experience.
00:53:19.96 --> 00:53:20.96 Yeah.
00:53:20.96 --> 00:53:22.76 They had a little too much dirt.
00:53:22.76 --> 00:53:23.76 Yeah, exactly.
00:53:23.76 --> 00:53:29.20 All right, so now we're talking about Grant, General Grant, Civil War General, and
00:53:29.20 --> 00:53:32.64 beset by human failings.
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:34.84 He could not look impressive.
00:53:34.84 --> 00:53:39.72 Average though he wasn't many things, there was nothing average about the strong
00:53:39.72 --> 00:53:45.64 way in which he took hold, applying massive common sense to the complex problems of the
00:53:45.64 --> 00:53:47.48 field.
00:53:47.48 --> 00:53:50.24 That is why he is worth close regard.
00:53:50.24 --> 00:53:56.68 His virtues as a military leader were of the simpler sort, which plain men may understand
00:53:56.68 --> 00:53:58.36 and hope to emulate.
00:53:58.36 --> 00:54:00.40 He was direct in manner.
00:54:00.40 --> 00:54:01.96 He never intrigued.
00:54:01.96 --> 00:54:03.52 His speech was homely.
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:04.92 He was approachable.
00:54:04.92 --> 00:54:07.84 His mind never deviated from the object.
00:54:07.84 --> 00:54:13.48 Though a stubborn man, he was always willing to listen to his subordinates.
00:54:13.48 --> 00:54:14.84 And I love this one right here.
00:54:14.84 --> 00:54:18.40 He never adhered to a plan, obsnitely.
00:54:18.40 --> 00:54:23.20 But nothing could induce him to forsake the idea behind the plan.
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:25.24 So look, I'm not going to say, here's my idea.
00:54:25.24 --> 00:54:27.68 And I'm going to hold that idea because it's good.
00:54:27.68 --> 00:54:30.16 But the plan that's going to get us there, I'm not going to have to worry about that.
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:32.32 I'm not going to hold onto that.
00:54:32.32 --> 00:54:35.88 And let it drag me into the ground.
00:54:35.88 --> 00:54:45.08 Back to the book in the military services, though there are niches for the pad down.
00:54:45.08 --> 00:54:50.12 Character is at all times at least as vital as intellect.
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:58.58 So padant is like overly educated types in area where you get padented, right?
00:54:58.58 --> 00:55:05.86 And the main rewards go to him who can make other men feel toughened as well as elevated.
00:55:05.86 --> 00:55:09.70 Here's some trade tier, quiet resolution.
00:55:09.70 --> 00:55:12.18 The hardyhood to take risks.
00:55:12.18 --> 00:55:18.30 The will to take full responsibility for decisions.
00:55:18.30 --> 00:55:22.42 The readiness to share its rewards with subordinates.
00:55:22.42 --> 00:55:26.94 This is obviously extreme ownership and part of extreme ownership is when you something
00:55:26.94 --> 00:55:28.98 goes well, you don't own that part.
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:31.78 You give that away.
00:55:31.78 --> 00:55:38.38 And the key thing is to take the blame when things go adversely boom.
00:55:38.38 --> 00:55:45.94 The nerve to survive storm and disappointment and to face towards each new day with the
00:55:45.94 --> 00:55:48.70 score sheet wiped clean.
00:55:48.70 --> 00:55:56.50 Neither dwelling on one successes nor accepting discouragement from one's failures.
00:55:56.50 --> 00:55:58.70 Like I said, this book should be issued to 13 year olds.
00:55:58.70 --> 00:56:00.90 Yeah, that was a really good book.
00:56:00.90 --> 00:56:05.54 I figured you dig this one.
00:56:05.54 --> 00:56:07.74 I used a lot of highlight around this one.
00:56:07.74 --> 00:56:09.34 I've had this book for a long time.
00:56:09.34 --> 00:56:10.62 I couldn't, it's funny.
00:56:10.62 --> 00:56:14.70 When I read it this time, I hadn't read it in so long that it was almost like I was reading
00:56:14.70 --> 00:56:15.70 it again.
00:56:15.70 --> 00:56:18.02 I pretty much it forgot most of it.
00:56:18.02 --> 00:56:23.70 And a lot of it, I subconsciously, we've been probably part of my game for a long time.
00:56:23.70 --> 00:56:25.14 I can't tell, though.
00:56:25.14 --> 00:56:31.62 I can't tell what I just, what I buried and what was a seed that grew.
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:34.74 Probably there's some ideas in here that were seeds of my thought.
00:56:34.74 --> 00:56:37.70 Yeah, I would imagine so that that's not the kind of book where it's like, oh yeah,
00:56:37.70 --> 00:56:39.42 let me memorize all this.
00:56:39.42 --> 00:56:40.70 It's more like, oh, shoot, I got it.
00:56:40.70 --> 00:56:42.98 I got it kind of in Jess.
00:56:42.98 --> 00:56:45.90 Yes, and here's the straight-up truth.
00:56:45.90 --> 00:56:49.58 When somebody gave me this book, I probably read 10 pages of it and said, oh, this is pretty
00:56:49.58 --> 00:56:50.58 cool.
00:56:50.58 --> 00:56:53.94 Put it in my locker and then went out and worked out and forgot about it for the next 15
00:56:53.94 --> 00:56:54.94 years.
00:56:54.94 --> 00:57:04.22 So it's not, I didn't, you know, this current jacco will call it where I kind of overlay
00:57:04.22 --> 00:57:08.94 and bring in, it's like a jiu-jitsu when you're going to jiu-jitsu.
00:57:08.94 --> 00:57:13.70 If you're a brown belt, I'm purple, the black belt and jiu-jitsu.
00:57:13.70 --> 00:57:17.02 Somebody can show you a move and you can assimilate it really quickly and you go, oh yeah,
00:57:17.02 --> 00:57:18.86 I need to do this.
00:57:18.86 --> 00:57:22.70 Well, I was a white belt before in this stuff.
00:57:22.70 --> 00:57:27.66 So when I'd read it, it kind of made sense, but it was, it was didn't make as much
00:57:27.66 --> 00:57:32.50 sense as that when I read this stuff now, it's like I totally understand it at a deeper
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:33.50 level.
00:57:33.50 --> 00:57:41.06 And so it's way more impactful for me.
00:57:41.06 --> 00:57:44.62 People always ask me about this one as well, back to the book, to speak of the importance
00:57:44.62 --> 00:57:49.10 of a sense of humor would be unavailing.
00:57:49.10 --> 00:57:55.90 If it were not that what cramped so many men isn't that they are by nature humorless,
00:57:55.90 --> 00:58:02.78 but that they are hesitant to exercise what humor they possess.
00:58:02.78 --> 00:58:07.82 Within the military profession, it is as unwise to let the muscles go soft and to spare
00:58:07.82 --> 00:58:11.74 the mind, the strain of original thinking.
00:58:11.74 --> 00:58:15.50 Great humor has always been in the military tradition.
00:58:15.50 --> 00:58:18.34 People ask, for some reason people ask me about humor a lot.
00:58:18.34 --> 00:58:22.02 It's not good for an author, or it's not good for a leader to tell to.
00:58:22.02 --> 00:58:23.02 And yes, it is.
00:58:23.02 --> 00:58:26.66 And that's why I always, whenever there's something funny in the war books that we read,
00:58:26.66 --> 00:58:28.70 I always try and capture that.
00:58:28.70 --> 00:58:32.22 So then people realize that these guys are out there and they keep that sense of humor going
00:58:32.22 --> 00:58:33.22 all the time.
00:58:33.22 --> 00:58:34.22 Yeah.
00:58:34.22 --> 00:58:36.38 And I guess that doesn't really necessarily mean.
00:58:36.38 --> 00:58:37.78 Telling jokes all the time.
00:58:37.78 --> 00:58:39.50 No, just like levity.
00:58:39.50 --> 00:58:41.14 Yeah, I feel that's funny.
00:58:41.14 --> 00:58:42.14 I'm going to, you know.
00:58:42.14 --> 00:58:47.74 Yeah, yeah, just having a good time making light of these miserable situations for sure.
00:58:47.74 --> 00:58:48.74 Hmm.
00:58:48.74 --> 00:58:58.22 Said Admiral, this is going into the next chapter, which is called main springs of leadership.
00:58:58.22 --> 00:59:02.86 Said Admiral, forest, p-shermon, chief of naval operations.
00:59:02.86 --> 00:59:07.02 I concur that we can take average good men.
00:59:07.02 --> 00:59:13.18 And by proper training, developing them the essential initiative, constant confidence,
00:59:13.18 --> 00:59:17.06 and magnetism, which are necessary in leadership.
00:59:17.06 --> 00:59:22.46 I believe that these qualities are present in the average man to a degree that he can be
00:59:22.46 --> 00:59:27.90 made a good leader if his native qualities are properly developed.
00:59:27.90 --> 00:59:32.78 Whether or not he becomes a great leader depends upon whether or not he possesses that extra
00:59:32.78 --> 00:59:40.10 initiative, magnetism, moral courage and force, which makes the difference between the average
00:59:40.10 --> 00:59:43.46 man and the above average man.
00:59:43.46 --> 00:59:48.86 The general CBKates, common down to the Marine Corps, leadership is intangible, hard to
00:59:48.86 --> 00:59:51.22 measure and difficult to describe.
00:59:51.22 --> 00:59:56.66 Its qualities would seem to stem from many factors, but certainly they must include a measure
00:59:56.66 --> 00:59:59.54 of inherent ability to control and direct.
00:59:59.54 --> 01:00:06.74 Self-confidence based on expert knowledge, initiative, loyalty, pride, and sense of responsibility.
01:00:06.74 --> 01:00:12.66 Inherinability obviously cannot be instilled, but that which is latent or dormant can be
01:00:12.66 --> 01:00:15.06 developed.
01:00:15.06 --> 01:00:17.54 Other ingredients can be acquired.
01:00:17.54 --> 01:00:25.22 They are not easily taught or easily learned, but leaders can be and can be and are made.
01:00:25.22 --> 01:00:32.18 The average good man in our service is and must be considered a potential leader.
01:00:32.18 --> 01:00:33.98 So there you go to that question.
01:00:33.98 --> 01:00:38.38 It's the same answer that I give, basically all the time when people ask me if leaders
01:00:38.38 --> 01:00:42.94 are born or made, there's the answer from these two guys they agree with me or I'll
01:00:42.94 --> 01:00:45.50 say I agree with them since they're senior to me.
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:49.06 But look, you got certain traits.
01:00:49.06 --> 01:00:52.74 You can take, I always say look, you can take someone that's an okay leader and make
01:00:52.74 --> 01:00:53.74 them a better leader.
01:00:53.74 --> 01:00:56.74 You can take a good leader and make them an outstanding leader and outstanding leader.
01:00:56.74 --> 01:01:00.86 You can make them epic leader because you can improve these things.
01:01:00.86 --> 01:01:02.98 You can learn about these things.
01:01:02.98 --> 01:01:06.54 The one person that you can't make any better is the person that's not humble.
01:01:06.54 --> 01:01:10.38 They're not going to get any better because they can't be coached because standing in his
01:01:10.38 --> 01:01:12.42 own light, because he's standing in his own light.
01:01:12.42 --> 01:01:20.14 Maybe we'll bring that back in and bring that back back to the book and before I go
01:01:20.14 --> 01:01:21.98 back to the book.
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:25.86 This is another thing I get asked about a lot is people ask me because they know that
01:01:25.86 --> 01:01:27.86 I work a lot.
01:01:27.86 --> 01:01:29.86 They know that I get after it.
01:01:29.86 --> 01:01:30.86 Right?
01:01:30.86 --> 01:01:35.22 And they ask me about, you know, how do you, how do you do with your family?
01:01:35.22 --> 01:01:39.66 You got a family because I got four children and a wife and a goldfish.
01:01:39.66 --> 01:01:40.66 Okay.
01:01:40.66 --> 01:01:44.46 So, I sickle.
01:01:44.46 --> 01:01:45.46 That's the name.
01:01:45.46 --> 01:01:46.46 That's the name.
01:01:46.46 --> 01:01:47.46 Right?
01:01:47.46 --> 01:01:49.62 So, I got to give, you know, to the family, right?
01:01:49.62 --> 01:01:52.26 So people say, how do you, how do you balance?
01:01:52.26 --> 01:01:53.26 So here we go.
01:01:53.26 --> 01:01:54.26 Back to the book.
01:01:54.26 --> 01:02:01.70 Personal advancement within any worthwhile system requires some sacrifice of leisure and more
01:02:01.70 --> 01:02:08.50 careful attention to the better organization of ones working routine.
01:02:08.50 --> 01:02:16.42 But that does not entail heroic self-sacrifice or forfeiting of any of life's truly enduring
01:02:16.42 --> 01:02:18.42 rewards.
01:02:18.42 --> 01:02:23.06 It means putting the completion of work ahead of golf.
01:02:23.06 --> 01:02:25.06 Yeah.
01:02:25.06 --> 01:02:31.66 So, so often you see people that you're just, I'm not going to work my way.
01:02:31.66 --> 01:02:32.66 Myself to death.
01:02:32.66 --> 01:02:33.66 Okay.
01:02:33.66 --> 01:02:34.66 Are you going to play golf to death?
01:02:34.66 --> 01:02:36.66 Because that's apparently what you're trying to do here.
01:02:36.66 --> 01:02:37.66 Right?
01:02:37.66 --> 01:02:39.66 But yeah, you got to find balance.
01:02:39.66 --> 01:02:43.82 You got to find balance, especially when he's talking about life's true and enduring rewards.
01:02:43.82 --> 01:02:52.10 That's talking about your family and the things that you achieve outside of the work world.
01:02:52.10 --> 01:02:53.10 Abbey dimnet.
01:02:53.10 --> 01:03:04.42 Abbey dimnet was a priest, a priest in wrote a book called The Art of Thinking.
01:03:04.42 --> 01:03:05.70 And he's quoted here in this book.
01:03:05.70 --> 01:03:13.46 He said, concentration is supposed to be exceptional only because people do not try and
01:03:13.46 --> 01:03:21.70 in this as so many things starve within an inch of plenty.
01:03:21.70 --> 01:03:22.70 You're almost there.
01:03:22.70 --> 01:03:23.70 Almost there.
01:03:23.70 --> 01:03:29.70 Almost got plenty, but you're starting to death.
01:03:29.70 --> 01:03:30.70 Right there.
01:03:30.70 --> 01:03:31.70 We're in an inch.
01:03:31.70 --> 01:03:32.70 Why?
01:03:32.70 --> 01:03:33.70 Because you failed to concentrate.
01:03:33.70 --> 01:03:34.70 You failed to focus.
01:03:34.70 --> 01:03:39.70 And that's what happens.
01:03:39.70 --> 01:03:41.70 Oh, and well, this is just awesome.
01:03:41.70 --> 01:03:42.70 Here we go.
01:03:42.70 --> 01:03:49.70 There is, of course, that commonest of excuses for rejecting the difficult and taking life
01:03:49.70 --> 01:03:50.70 easy.
01:03:50.70 --> 01:03:53.70 I haven't time.
01:03:53.70 --> 01:03:59.82 But for the man who keeps his mind on the object, there is always time.
01:03:59.82 --> 01:04:01.42 Figure it out.
01:04:01.42 --> 01:04:06.82 About us in the service as daily, we see busy men who somehow manage to find time for whatever
01:04:06.82 --> 01:04:09.18 is worth doing.
01:04:09.18 --> 01:04:15.62 While at the adjoining desks, our others with abundant leisure who can't find time for
01:04:15.62 --> 01:04:17.82 anything.
01:04:17.82 --> 01:04:24.82 And something important requires doing is usually the busy man who gets the call.
01:04:24.82 --> 01:04:28.46 Time got time for that, huh?
01:04:28.46 --> 01:04:29.46 There's always time.
01:04:29.46 --> 01:04:30.46 Yeah.
01:04:30.46 --> 01:04:31.46 Always time.
01:04:31.46 --> 01:04:36.98 And how can you ever have time if you don't take time?
01:04:36.98 --> 01:04:39.26 That sounds cool, but I don't know what it means.
01:04:39.26 --> 01:04:40.26 Expand.
01:04:40.26 --> 01:04:41.26 Oh, who has time?
01:04:41.26 --> 01:04:44.82 Ah, but how can you ever have time if you don't take time?
01:04:44.82 --> 01:04:45.82 Oh, so you're going to take out.
01:04:45.82 --> 01:04:46.82 Okay.
01:04:46.82 --> 01:04:47.66 Okay.
01:04:47.66 --> 01:04:48.66 So, is that where it's from?
01:04:48.66 --> 01:04:51.66 The mate, like part two or something like that.
01:04:51.66 --> 01:04:53.66 Did some, there was a part two to that movie?
01:04:53.66 --> 01:04:56.66 I think there was like a part three too.
01:04:56.66 --> 01:04:58.14 Anyway, that was a good one.
01:04:58.14 --> 01:04:59.14 It's true though.
01:04:59.14 --> 01:05:04.66 You know how like, guys will be like, hey, I want to get in like really good shape or something
01:05:04.66 --> 01:05:05.66 like this.
01:05:05.66 --> 01:05:06.66 I want to get like real strong or whatever.
01:05:06.66 --> 01:05:07.66 I was like, okay.
01:05:07.66 --> 01:05:08.66 You have to work out like this.
01:05:08.66 --> 01:05:12.66 I don't have like time to both, then you don't have time then.
01:05:12.66 --> 01:05:13.66 You then you can't get in shape.
01:05:13.66 --> 01:05:16.66 It's like saying I don't have the inclination.
01:05:16.66 --> 01:05:18.66 It's more or less the same thing.
01:05:18.66 --> 01:05:19.66 I don't have the time.
01:05:19.66 --> 01:05:30.66 Yeah, I was with one of my buddies and we were counseling someone and my buddy said,
01:05:30.66 --> 01:05:32.66 you don't care about this.
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:36.66 Then the guy says, no, no, I do care.
01:05:36.66 --> 01:05:38.66 And he said, well, why can't you show up on time?
01:05:38.66 --> 01:05:41.66 If you cared, you would show up on time.
01:05:41.66 --> 01:05:42.66 And K's closed.
01:05:42.66 --> 01:05:43.66 You're fired.
01:05:43.66 --> 01:05:44.66 That was that.
01:05:44.66 --> 01:05:45.66 I was like, well, you know what?
01:05:45.66 --> 01:05:47.66 Let's just stop talking because we're done.
01:05:47.66 --> 01:05:48.66 We're done.
01:05:48.66 --> 01:05:49.66 That's 100% accurate.
01:05:49.66 --> 01:05:50.66 So old true.
01:05:50.66 --> 01:05:54.66 So, as you probably know, I come from a long line of lately.
01:05:54.66 --> 01:05:56.66 Yes, we've discussed that before.
01:05:56.66 --> 01:05:59.66 So I kind of analyzed it.
01:05:59.66 --> 01:06:01.66 Where there was a time where I felt like,
01:06:01.66 --> 01:06:02.66 I just, I don't know.
01:06:02.66 --> 01:06:04.66 I just can't be on.
01:06:04.66 --> 01:06:07.66 It's like, it's like almost like this like a mentor physical black almost.
01:06:07.66 --> 01:06:08.66 That's what I felt like.
01:06:08.66 --> 01:06:10.66 But then.
01:06:10.66 --> 01:06:11.66 Okay.
01:06:11.66 --> 01:06:13.66 Really analyzed.
01:06:13.66 --> 01:06:16.66 When you really realized that you were just lazy.
01:06:16.66 --> 01:06:17.66 No, I'm not lazy.
01:06:17.66 --> 01:06:18.66 It wasn't important.
01:06:18.66 --> 01:06:19.66 Just like what you're saying.
01:06:19.66 --> 01:06:22.66 And this is what, so let's say work for example.
01:06:22.66 --> 01:06:24.66 I was late literally more times than I was on time.
01:06:24.66 --> 01:06:25.66 At work.
01:06:25.66 --> 01:06:26.66 I was so many times.
01:06:26.66 --> 01:06:28.66 Well, I did a good enough job.
01:06:28.66 --> 01:06:29.66 I would have fired you.
01:06:29.66 --> 01:06:31.66 And then rehired you so I could fire you.
01:06:31.66 --> 01:06:32.66 You started to take pleasure.
01:06:32.66 --> 01:06:34.66 You probably would have been a good idea.
01:06:34.66 --> 01:06:35.66 Nonetheless.
01:06:35.66 --> 01:06:37.66 So when I analyzed it, I was like,
01:06:37.66 --> 01:06:38.66 Why am I late?
01:06:38.66 --> 01:06:41.66 Why don't I get prepared the night before?
01:06:41.66 --> 01:06:44.66 Whatever it takes to be on time every single time.
01:06:44.66 --> 01:06:46.66 And just like, it's not important.
01:06:46.66 --> 01:06:51.66 Like, why would I spend my off work time preparing to go be at work?
01:06:51.66 --> 01:06:52.66 Yeah.
01:06:52.66 --> 01:06:57.66 I should be resting or that's my off time watching a little bit more television.
01:06:57.66 --> 01:06:59.66 TV or yeah, whatever.
01:06:59.66 --> 01:07:00.66 Not working.
01:07:00.66 --> 01:07:02.66 I can squeeze in another episode of this program.
01:07:02.66 --> 01:07:03.66 Exactly right.
01:07:03.66 --> 01:07:04.66 Not working.
01:07:04.66 --> 01:07:07.66 Why should I spend off work time doing work stuff?
01:07:07.66 --> 01:07:09.66 Like, I'm not getting paid or kind of thing.
01:07:09.66 --> 01:07:10.66 You know, it's not important.
01:07:10.66 --> 01:07:15.66 And that's going back to what this whole book starting off with the attitude of trying to do good job all the time.
01:07:15.66 --> 01:07:17.66 And actually somebody brought that up.
01:07:17.66 --> 01:07:18.66 It's somebody sent me a direct message.
01:07:18.66 --> 01:07:20.66 And this was a great point that I didn't think about.
01:07:20.66 --> 01:07:23.66 We got asked another question on the podcast about,
01:07:23.66 --> 01:07:27.66 Hey, if you're getting told to go to a meeting that you're not going to get paid for.
01:07:27.66 --> 01:07:29.66 Remember that conversation?
01:07:29.66 --> 01:07:32.66 This guy wrote me and said, Hey, you know, legally that that's illegal.
01:07:32.66 --> 01:07:38.66 If you're on an hourly wage, so that's a great point that I didn't think of it from a HR perspective.
01:07:38.66 --> 01:07:41.66 But that's a good point. Now you got people that you're breaking a law.
01:07:41.66 --> 01:07:45.66 So I kind of assume that these guys were not being specifically compensated,
01:07:45.66 --> 01:07:49.66 but that they were maybe salary employees that they were.
01:07:49.66 --> 01:07:50.66 But I could be wrong.
01:07:50.66 --> 01:07:55.66 And if those people are hourly, now you got to go to the boss and say, Hey, boss,
01:07:55.66 --> 01:08:01.66 I want to get this meeting going, but what you're doing to us and what you're doing to these guys is illegal.
01:08:01.66 --> 01:08:02.66 Yeah.
01:08:02.66 --> 01:08:07.66 You know, maybe the manager a lot of times managers are salaryed and the workers are hourly.
01:08:07.66 --> 01:08:10.66 So he would need to go look, I'll come to the meeting because I'm on salary. It's all good with me.
01:08:10.66 --> 01:08:11.66 I'm here to win.
01:08:11.66 --> 01:08:14.66 But the guys, I can't bring him in here unless you want to be looking at a,
01:08:14.66 --> 01:08:17.66 at a labor lawsuit, you in the game for that boss, because I'm not.
01:08:17.66 --> 01:08:20.66 That's going to cost our company money. It's going to make us look bad.
01:08:20.66 --> 01:08:22.66 Let's, let's do this another way.
01:08:22.66 --> 01:08:22.66 Yeah.
01:08:22.66 --> 01:08:23.66 Boom.
01:08:23.66 --> 01:08:27.66 But that is a different element to the whole, like the point as far as what you're talking.
01:08:27.66 --> 01:08:31.66 We're what you're talking about, like it's something like not important versus if you're in person.
01:08:31.66 --> 01:08:34.66 Like it doesn't necessarily go for just work that's why.
01:08:34.66 --> 01:08:39.66 It goes for anything, like if you're late to anything, like if you, if you, like this podcast,
01:08:39.66 --> 01:08:41.66 I'm rolling in late every single time.
01:08:41.66 --> 01:08:46.66 It's obviously because being on time is not important and that leads into this podcast.
01:08:46.66 --> 01:08:50.66 And one way or another, what we're about to do isn't important enough.
01:08:50.66 --> 01:08:53.66 That's why you're on time because it is important to you.
01:08:53.66 --> 01:08:54.66 There you go.
01:08:54.66 --> 01:08:55.66 Boom.
01:08:55.66 --> 01:08:56.66 Because it's important to me to you.
01:08:56.66 --> 01:09:03.66 And I will spend off my quote and quote free time doing stuff to prepare for, you know, the on time.
01:09:03.66 --> 01:09:04.66 It's stuff.
01:09:04.66 --> 01:09:05.66 We're got it's good.
01:09:05.66 --> 01:09:07.66 And you seem to say otherwise you'd be getting fired.
01:09:07.66 --> 01:09:09.66 I'm just using this as a hype.
01:09:09.66 --> 01:09:11.66 Give me another echo Charles.
01:09:11.66 --> 01:09:13.66 You're going to throw the right one.
01:09:13.66 --> 01:09:15.66 You don't even know the difference.
01:09:15.66 --> 01:09:16.66 Yeah.
01:09:16.66 --> 01:09:17.66 Good.
01:09:17.66 --> 01:09:18.66 Although he probably genetically has the same problem.
01:09:18.66 --> 01:09:19.66 Yeah.
01:09:19.66 --> 01:09:21.66 I told you we come from a long line.
01:09:21.66 --> 01:09:24.66 Now he knows the importance of, you know.
01:09:24.66 --> 01:09:27.66 And it's a, and it's a sign of disrespect, too, by the way.
01:09:27.66 --> 01:09:28.66 Yes.
01:09:28.66 --> 01:09:32.66 It's like saying not only do I not think what we're, what we've planned to do or agreed to do.
01:09:32.66 --> 01:09:33.66 And all this time stuff.
01:09:33.66 --> 01:09:36.66 Not only do I not think that's important.
01:09:36.66 --> 01:09:39.66 I don't respect how much you think it's important.
01:09:39.66 --> 01:09:41.66 That's what we respect my time.
01:09:41.66 --> 01:09:42.66 Nope.
01:09:42.66 --> 01:09:43.66 Not at all.
01:09:43.66 --> 01:09:44.66 Not at all.
01:09:44.66 --> 01:09:45.66 The on time.
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:46.66 Well.
01:09:46.66 --> 01:09:47.66 And make time.
01:09:47.66 --> 01:09:48.66 Take time.
01:09:48.66 --> 01:09:53.66 If, yeah, if you want to have time, you got to take care.
01:09:53.66 --> 01:09:54.66 Yeah.
01:09:54.66 --> 01:10:00.66 And that's what's so like about this guy's actually making fun of people that say I haven't got time.
01:10:00.66 --> 01:10:09.66 Because for the man who keeps his mind on the object there is always time.
01:10:09.66 --> 01:10:16.66 Next section says, much is conveyed in, in few words, in Army field forces brief on practical
01:10:16.66 --> 01:10:18.66 concepts of leadership.
01:10:18.66 --> 01:10:25.66 It is stressed therein that the preeminent quality, which all great commanders have owned
01:10:25.66 --> 01:10:31.16 common is a posiveness of manner and viewpoint.
01:10:31.16 --> 01:10:39.78 The power to concentrate on means to a given end to the exclusion of exaggerated fears of the
01:10:39.78 --> 01:10:45.34 obstacles which lie afroarch the course.
01:10:45.34 --> 01:10:47.66 Every word of that should be underscored.
01:10:47.66 --> 01:10:53.66 And above all, what it says about the need for affirmative thinking and concentrating on how things
01:10:53.66 --> 01:10:54.66 can be done.
01:10:54.66 --> 01:10:55.66 This is the part.
01:10:55.66 --> 01:10:56.66 You always hear about this.
01:10:56.66 --> 01:10:58.66 You always hear about this person.
01:10:58.66 --> 01:11:02.66 The person that says, when you go to them and say, hey, can we do this?
01:11:02.66 --> 01:11:04.66 They're always looking for a way to say no.
01:11:04.66 --> 01:11:08.10 A reason why something can happen instead of, no, we can do that.
01:11:08.10 --> 01:11:09.10 We can make that happen.
01:11:09.10 --> 01:11:10.74 We can figure out a way.
01:11:10.74 --> 01:11:14.66 That's what we're looking for.
01:11:14.66 --> 01:11:16.66 Next section.
01:11:16.66 --> 01:11:25.02 Those in this section is actually the same topic of what this podcast is the topic of and
01:11:25.02 --> 01:11:29.06 that is human nature.
01:11:29.06 --> 01:11:33.94 Those who had the chance to study American men under the terrible rigor of Japanese and
01:11:33.94 --> 01:11:41.34 prison during World War II gave an analysis that in certain of the prisoners, character
01:11:41.34 --> 01:11:47.02 insanity with it, held fast against every circumstance.
01:11:47.02 --> 01:11:53.98 In others, some of whom had been well educated and came from gentle homes, the brute instinct
01:11:53.98 --> 01:12:00.38 was as uppermost as in an east African cannibal.
01:12:00.38 --> 01:12:04.02 And when they say brute instinct, that's the person that just loses and goes to the animal
01:12:04.02 --> 01:12:07.22 instincts.
01:12:07.22 --> 01:12:14.42 Some such crucibles as these even more than from the remittance stresses of combat and war
01:12:14.42 --> 01:12:19.86 comes the clearest light on the inner nature of man in so far as it needs to be understood
01:12:19.86 --> 01:12:25.54 by the officer who may someday lead a force into battle.
01:12:25.54 --> 01:12:33.10 Human nature.
01:12:33.10 --> 01:12:39.18 One of the things that he says about human nature in here is good will and weakness, maybe
01:12:39.18 --> 01:12:44.78 combined in one man, bad will and strength in another.
01:12:44.78 --> 01:12:49.18 High moral leading can lift the first man to excel himself.
01:12:49.18 --> 01:12:52.18 It will not reform the other.
01:12:52.18 --> 01:12:59.26 But there is no other sensible rule, then that all men will be approached with trust and
01:12:59.26 --> 01:13:06.26 treated his trust trustworthy until proved otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.
01:13:06.26 --> 01:13:08.70 So he's thrown out the trust.
01:13:08.70 --> 01:13:09.70 He's a little bit of an option.
01:13:09.70 --> 01:13:10.70 I've talked about it.
01:13:10.70 --> 01:13:13.86 I actually, I should take that back.
01:13:13.86 --> 01:13:17.18 Remember one time on the podcast, I said, look, I don't have a high expectation of people
01:13:17.18 --> 01:13:18.18 when I meet him.
01:13:18.18 --> 01:13:21.30 And I hold that true to this day.
01:13:21.30 --> 01:13:24.26 But I don't straight up not trust them as a human.
01:13:24.26 --> 01:13:25.26 Yeah.
01:13:25.26 --> 01:13:26.26 There's a difference there.
01:13:26.26 --> 01:13:27.26 I think there's a difference.
01:13:27.26 --> 01:13:28.26 I think I feel that way.
01:13:28.26 --> 01:13:32.98 There is a, yeah, and it's not an obvious difference, but it's like the difference between
01:13:32.98 --> 01:13:35.14 I don't have an high expectation of somebody.
01:13:35.14 --> 01:13:37.98 And versus I have a low expectation of person.
01:13:37.98 --> 01:13:38.98 Got it.
01:13:38.98 --> 01:13:39.98 Somebody.
01:13:39.98 --> 01:13:41.98 So it does sound the same.
01:13:41.98 --> 01:13:42.98 It sounds the same.
01:13:42.98 --> 01:13:45.98 It's not an expectation than what kind of expectation do you have?
01:13:45.98 --> 01:13:46.98 No.
01:13:46.98 --> 01:13:47.98 No.
01:13:47.98 --> 01:13:48.98 Maybe just a neutral one.
01:13:48.98 --> 01:13:49.98 Right.
01:13:49.98 --> 01:13:51.70 Like I'm not going to put any expectations.
01:13:51.70 --> 01:13:56.06 I'm not expecting you to do a bunch of hero, I don't have any expectations.
01:13:56.06 --> 01:13:57.06 Just neutral.
01:13:57.06 --> 01:14:00.26 I come in with a neutral attitude on that one.
01:14:00.26 --> 01:14:01.26 Yeah.
01:14:01.26 --> 01:14:06.22 Back to the book, Men do not achieve a great solidarity or preserve it simply by being
01:14:06.22 --> 01:14:08.02 together.
01:14:08.02 --> 01:14:14.30 Their mutual bonds are forged only by doing together, that which they have been convinced
01:14:14.30 --> 01:14:17.22 is constructive.
01:14:17.22 --> 01:14:23.34 The absence of a common purpose is the chief source of unhappiness in any collection
01:14:23.34 --> 01:14:25.62 of individuals.
01:14:25.62 --> 01:14:32.34 Talking it and the common standard of justice, which is one of its chief agents, men become
01:14:32.34 --> 01:14:39.58 more and more separate units, each fighting for his own rights.
01:14:39.58 --> 01:14:41.46 This is why you got to have that common purpose.
01:14:41.46 --> 01:14:43.38 This is why that commander's intent is so important.
01:14:43.38 --> 01:14:47.42 This is why it's important that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing.
01:14:47.42 --> 01:14:51.70 They have to understand the strategic goal that you're trying to meet as a company, as
01:14:51.70 --> 01:14:55.58 a business, as a team, as a platoon.
01:14:55.58 --> 01:15:00.34 And that's a person and like a lot of people, they go into straight up depression.
01:15:00.34 --> 01:15:03.66 Because I mean, if they don't see the big goal, if they don't see a purpose in their
01:15:03.66 --> 01:15:08.82 life, that is true.
01:15:08.82 --> 01:15:18.70 Back to the book, whatever his rank, it is impossible for any man to lead if he is himself
01:15:18.70 --> 01:15:21.18 running behind.
01:15:21.18 --> 01:15:26.98 This bespeaks the need of constant study, the constant use of one's personal powers and
01:15:26.98 --> 01:15:30.42 the exercise of the imagination.
01:15:30.42 --> 01:15:36.66 As men advance, that which was good soon ceases to be good simply because something
01:15:36.66 --> 01:15:37.98 better is possible.
01:15:37.98 --> 01:15:40.10 You got to evolve.
01:15:40.10 --> 01:15:45.42 You got to continue to evolve, you got to continue to improve yourself.
01:15:45.42 --> 01:15:51.10 History confirms, and a study of the workings of the human mind supports one proposition
01:15:51.10 --> 01:15:57.34 which many of the great captains of war have accepted as a truism.
01:15:57.34 --> 01:15:59.66 There are no bad troops.
01:15:59.66 --> 01:16:03.02 There are only bad leaders.
01:16:03.02 --> 01:16:05.02 Yeah.
01:16:05.02 --> 01:16:06.02 Interesting.
01:16:06.02 --> 01:16:11.90 It's here Napoleon said, Napoleon said there's no bad kernels, only bad regiments.
01:16:11.90 --> 01:16:14.42 Hackworth said the same thing.
01:16:14.42 --> 01:16:15.42 No bad team.
01:16:15.42 --> 01:16:20.50 I think he said no bad troops, only bad officers in the book that Laefan, I wrote, no bad
01:16:20.50 --> 01:16:21.82 teams, only bad leaders.
01:16:21.82 --> 01:16:30.82 So very common and very true stands the test of time.
01:16:30.82 --> 01:16:34.38 You know, there's a reason why Napoleon fought that.
01:16:34.38 --> 01:16:37.42 There's a reason why SLA Marshall said that.
01:16:37.42 --> 01:16:39.10 There's a reason why Hackworth said that.
01:16:39.10 --> 01:16:41.42 There's a reason why Laefan, I put that in the book.
01:16:41.42 --> 01:16:42.90 Because that is true.
01:16:42.90 --> 01:16:47.38 In the minute you, if you're in a leadership position, the minute that you accept that fact
01:16:47.38 --> 01:16:50.10 is the minute you step forward as becoming a better leader.
01:16:50.10 --> 01:16:53.82 Because as soon as you're blaming it on other people, you're just not going to make
01:16:53.82 --> 01:16:54.82 it bad.
01:16:54.82 --> 01:16:55.82 Oh my team sucks.
01:16:55.82 --> 01:16:56.82 You suck.
01:16:56.82 --> 01:16:57.82 Right.
01:16:57.82 --> 01:16:58.82 So it's lit.
01:16:58.82 --> 01:17:03.82 I don't know if you call this irony or what, but no bad team is only bad leaders.
01:17:03.82 --> 01:17:05.66 So if you're like, wait, that's not true.
01:17:05.66 --> 01:17:06.66 Oh, guess what?
01:17:06.66 --> 01:17:07.66 You're bad leader.
01:17:07.66 --> 01:17:08.66 Yeah.
01:17:08.66 --> 01:17:11.66 It's a good ticket catch 22.
01:17:11.66 --> 01:17:12.66 Yeah, yeah.
01:17:12.66 --> 01:17:17.58 What's good for the goose is good for the, again, actually, I don't think that's it.
01:17:17.58 --> 01:17:19.58 Alright, this is awesome.
01:17:19.58 --> 01:17:21.82 Here we go, back to the book.
01:17:21.82 --> 01:17:26.38 And this, actually, this section here has gone to group nature.
01:17:26.38 --> 01:17:29.38 So you've gone from human nature to group nature.
01:17:29.38 --> 01:17:36.52 Back to the book, among the commonest of experiences in war is to witness troops doing
01:17:36.52 --> 01:17:43.82 nothing or worse doing the wrong thing without one commanding voice being raised to give
01:17:43.82 --> 01:17:45.78 them direction.
01:17:45.78 --> 01:17:52.90 Such circumstance any man who has the nerve and presence to step forward and give them an
01:17:52.90 --> 01:17:59.70 intelligent order in a manner indicating that he expects to be obeyed will be accepted
01:17:59.70 --> 01:18:02.98 as a leader and will be given their support.
01:18:02.98 --> 01:18:04.54 Did you hear that?
01:18:04.54 --> 01:18:05.54 That's all it is.
01:18:05.54 --> 01:18:06.54 Who's going to step up?
01:18:06.54 --> 01:18:10.94 Who's going to have the nerve and the presence to step up and give an intelligent
01:18:10.94 --> 01:18:14.54 order that you believe in and that you believe will be followed on?
01:18:14.54 --> 01:18:17.82 I did you expect to be obeyed, you'll be obeyed.
01:18:17.82 --> 01:18:21.30 So again, I hear all these people say, well, you know, the senior position, therefore
01:18:21.30 --> 01:18:22.86 I can't do anything wrong.
01:18:22.86 --> 01:18:24.26 Actually, you can.
01:18:24.26 --> 01:18:28.06 Step up and lead.
01:18:28.06 --> 01:18:32.54 Back to the book for this reason, under the conditions of modern battle, the coherence of any
01:18:32.54 --> 01:18:40.62 military body comes not only of men being articulate all down the line, but of building
01:18:40.62 --> 01:18:45.18 up the dynamic power in each individual.
01:18:45.18 --> 01:18:50.54 It is a thoroughly sound exercise in any unit to give every man a chance to take charge
01:18:50.54 --> 01:18:55.70 and give orders in drill or other limited exercises once he has learned what the orders
01:18:55.70 --> 01:18:57.66 mean.
01:18:57.66 --> 01:19:03.62 By the same token, it is good practice for the junior leader to displace a file.
01:19:03.62 --> 01:19:08.10 That means just one of the guys to displace a file in a training exercise and become
01:19:08.10 --> 01:19:13.06 commanded for a time to sharpen his own perspective.
01:19:13.06 --> 01:19:20.26 So it's good for the junior guys to step up into leadership positions and lead.
01:19:20.26 --> 01:19:23.82 It's good for the leaders to go and be one of the boys in the cartoon.
01:19:23.82 --> 01:19:28.10 I got really lucky because I was a prior, I'm a prior and listed guy, I'm a mustang
01:19:28.10 --> 01:19:29.10 officer.
01:19:29.10 --> 01:19:33.94 So I spent my first eight years in the suit teams as a guy in the, I was one of the
01:19:33.94 --> 01:19:34.94 files.
01:19:34.94 --> 01:19:38.26 So I knew what it was like when a leader didn't tell you what was going on, I knew
01:19:38.26 --> 01:19:41.18 what it was like when you had a good leader.
01:19:41.18 --> 01:19:46.18 So when I stepped up into those leadership positions, I knew at least what not to do.
01:19:46.18 --> 01:19:48.54 And I knew what I would try and do to be a good leader.
01:19:48.54 --> 01:19:51.54 It's like the curse of knowledge.
01:19:51.54 --> 01:19:55.34 Like you don't curse the knowledge just when you can't see it from some inexperienced
01:19:55.34 --> 01:19:57.54 person's point of view.
01:19:57.54 --> 01:20:00.18 And so you don't really have that.
01:20:00.18 --> 01:20:01.18 Because you've been the inexperienced.
01:20:01.18 --> 01:20:02.58 You can just draw on those memories.
01:20:02.58 --> 01:20:05.78 You know, I have that perspective that full I know what is nice to do.
01:20:05.78 --> 01:20:10.46 I don't want to worst things in your at the end of a 16 man seal, put you in patrolling
01:20:10.46 --> 01:20:12.82 through the night and you just have no idea where you are.
01:20:12.82 --> 01:20:14.46 You have no idea how far the target is away.
01:20:14.46 --> 01:20:15.82 You have no idea when you're going to stop.
01:20:15.82 --> 01:20:16.82 You have no idea of anything.
01:20:16.82 --> 01:20:23.30 You're just rocking like a miserable boots, boots, boots.
01:20:23.30 --> 01:20:26.02 That's what you're getting the zone of.
01:20:26.02 --> 01:20:27.26 It's just the worst.
01:20:27.26 --> 01:20:30.90 So when I was a platoon commander, I was a squad leader.
01:20:30.90 --> 01:20:36.06 But I tried with everything I had to make sure everyone knew what's going on all the time.
01:20:36.06 --> 01:20:38.94 Because I never wanted my guys to be thinking, what is happening?
01:20:38.94 --> 01:20:39.94 What are we doing?
01:20:39.94 --> 01:20:45.22 Yeah, that's good.
01:20:45.22 --> 01:20:49.74 Progress comes of making the most of our strengths rather than looking for ways to repair
01:20:49.74 --> 01:20:51.34 weaknesses.
01:20:51.34 --> 01:20:54.10 This is true in things both large and small.
01:20:54.10 --> 01:20:59.54 The platoon leader who permits himself to be be deviled by the file who won't or can't
01:20:59.54 --> 01:21:05.22 keep step cannot do justice to the ambitions of the 10 strongest men beneath him.
01:21:05.22 --> 01:21:11.06 Upon whom the life of the formation would depend common emergency.
01:21:11.06 --> 01:21:16.62 To nourish and encourage the top rather than to concentrate effort and exhaust nerves and
01:21:16.62 --> 01:21:22.74 trying to correct a few least likely prospects is the healthy way of growth within military
01:21:22.74 --> 01:21:24.62 organization.
01:21:24.62 --> 01:21:27.34 Take care of your top people, put your photo, focus and energy them.
01:21:27.34 --> 01:21:30.94 And I was going to give some time to the guys that are struggling, trying to help them
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:31.94 out.
01:21:31.94 --> 01:21:33.26 But let's not focus on them.
01:21:33.26 --> 01:21:35.18 They're not going to make a break you.
01:21:35.18 --> 01:21:37.30 So it's leaders that you want to develop.
01:21:37.30 --> 01:21:40.22 You got a good seed that's starting to grow.
01:21:40.22 --> 01:21:42.22 Water that seed.
01:21:42.22 --> 01:21:44.18 Don't worry about that thing over there in the corner.
01:21:44.18 --> 01:21:49.18 That's not doing anything.
01:21:49.18 --> 01:21:51.82 It is a good, this is classic.
01:21:51.82 --> 01:21:58.34 It is a sign of a good level of discipline in command when orders are given and faithfully
01:21:58.34 --> 01:22:00.62 carried out.
01:22:00.62 --> 01:22:07.62 But it is a sign of a vastly superior condition when the men are prepared to demand those
01:22:07.62 --> 01:22:12.62 orders which they know the situation requires if it is to be helped.
01:22:12.62 --> 01:22:17.26 No competent subordinate sits around waiting for someone else to give impulse to movement
01:22:17.26 --> 01:22:21.74 if he senses if his senses tell him that things are going to pot.
01:22:21.74 --> 01:22:27.18 Either suggest a course of action to his superior or ask authority to execute it on his
01:22:27.18 --> 01:22:36.22 own or in the more desperate circumstances of the battlefield gives orders on his own initiative.
01:22:36.22 --> 01:22:38.54 Descentualized command.
01:22:38.54 --> 01:22:39.90 Everybody's a leader.
01:22:39.90 --> 01:22:44.74 Everybody steps up and makes things happen.
01:22:44.74 --> 01:22:48.50 Back to the book, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was thinking on these things when he said
01:22:48.50 --> 01:22:49.82 during World War II.
01:22:49.82 --> 01:22:55.42 There is among the massive individuals who carry rifles in war, a great amount of ingenuity
01:22:55.42 --> 01:22:57.30 and efficiency.
01:22:57.30 --> 01:23:02.78 If men can talk naturally to their officers, the product of their resourcefulness becomes
01:23:02.78 --> 01:23:06.62 available to all.
01:23:06.62 --> 01:23:09.50 So as long as you can, as long as you're guys feel comfortable talking to you, you're
01:23:09.50 --> 01:23:14.82 going to have access to all their ideas and all their ingenuity back to the book, but
01:23:14.82 --> 01:23:20.10 the art of open communication requires both receiving and ending and the besetting
01:23:20.10 --> 01:23:26.06 problems to get officers to talk naturally to men.
01:23:26.06 --> 01:23:30.58 Develop the relationships with the troops is what you got to do.
01:23:30.58 --> 01:23:39.02 Another section here at all training, all training at all levels has a dual object to
01:23:39.02 --> 01:23:45.70 develop us all as leaders of men and as followers of leaders.
01:23:45.70 --> 01:23:46.70 dichotomy.
01:23:46.70 --> 01:23:47.70 Got to be a leader.
01:23:47.70 --> 01:23:48.70 Got to be a follower.
01:23:48.70 --> 01:23:50.70 It's like your Twitter thing.
01:23:50.70 --> 01:23:53.10 You're Twitter by a leader follower.
01:23:53.10 --> 01:23:54.10 Oh, beaker listener.
01:23:54.10 --> 01:23:55.10 Let it dichotomy.
01:23:55.10 --> 01:23:56.10 Right, or reader?
01:23:56.10 --> 01:23:57.10 Right, or reader, yeah.
01:23:57.10 --> 01:23:58.10 Exactly.
01:23:58.10 --> 01:24:02.90 That is, that is, there's a dichotomy there.
01:24:02.90 --> 01:24:09.90 To the book, the paralysis which comes of fear can be lifted only through the resumption
01:24:09.90 --> 01:24:14.90 of action, which will again give individuals the feeling of organization.
01:24:14.90 --> 01:24:15.94 So this is interesting.
01:24:15.94 --> 01:24:26.90 We remember that Joe Owen, when he was in Korea, in the coldest war, in colder than hell,
01:24:26.90 --> 01:24:28.54 he's freezing.
01:24:28.54 --> 01:24:29.90 And there's shooting starts.
01:24:29.90 --> 01:24:32.58 And he's got his own procedure of how he's going to overcome the fear.
01:24:32.58 --> 01:24:33.58 He's going to do, he's going to take action.
01:24:33.58 --> 01:24:35.78 And it's something that I've said on here a bunch of times here.
01:24:35.78 --> 01:24:36.78 You're afraid of something?
01:24:36.78 --> 01:24:37.78 Take action.
01:24:37.78 --> 01:24:38.78 Step into it.
01:24:38.78 --> 01:24:43.14 So what this is saying is the same thing, but not on an individual level, but on a group
01:24:43.14 --> 01:24:44.14 level.
01:24:44.14 --> 01:24:45.42 Because we're talking about group nature here.
01:24:45.42 --> 01:24:48.66 And it's the same thing as you do with an individual.
01:24:48.66 --> 01:24:49.66 You do it the group.
01:24:49.66 --> 01:24:50.66 So listen to this again.
01:24:50.66 --> 01:24:56.34 The paralysis, which comes of fear, can be lifted only through the resumption of action, which
01:24:56.34 --> 01:25:01.46 will again give the individuals feeling of organization.
01:25:01.46 --> 01:25:06.78 This does not mean ordering a bayonet charge or firing a volley at such and such a clock.
01:25:06.78 --> 01:25:12.46 It may mean only padding one man on the back, talking it up to a couple of others, sending
01:25:12.46 --> 01:25:19.46 someone out to find a flank or turning one's self to dig in, while passing the word
01:25:19.46 --> 01:25:22.42 to others to do likewise.
01:25:22.42 --> 01:25:27.78 This is action in the realist sense of the term.
01:25:27.78 --> 01:25:34.78 Re-invigorating men toward the faking of many small actions develops the possibility
01:25:34.78 --> 01:25:37.54 of large and decisive action.
01:25:37.54 --> 01:25:44.42 The unit must first find itself before doing an effective job of finding the enemy out
01:25:44.42 --> 01:25:51.22 of those acts, which are incidental to the establishing of an order, the leader reaffirms
01:25:51.22 --> 01:25:53.42 his own power of decision.
01:25:53.42 --> 01:25:56.02 So those are beautiful advice.
01:25:56.02 --> 01:26:00.50 Just like you do with yourself, you're afraid of something, take action, step into it.
01:26:00.50 --> 01:26:03.02 You got your group and everyone started to get scared and overwhelmed.
01:26:03.02 --> 01:26:04.02 Let's take some action.
01:26:04.02 --> 01:26:05.02 Hey guys, dig in.
01:26:05.02 --> 01:26:07.78 Hey guys, online.
01:26:07.78 --> 01:26:11.46 Whatever that order is going to be, that's that for it may not solve the problem, but it
01:26:11.46 --> 01:26:16.90 regains your stability as a team.
01:26:16.90 --> 01:26:23.10 Now you can move forward.
01:26:23.10 --> 01:26:29.26 This next section is subtitled environment.
01:26:29.26 --> 01:26:34.58 Back to the book, it is only to the man who is burned with unnecessary and exaggerated
01:26:34.58 --> 01:26:42.86 fear, fears, and who mistakes for fancy security, the privilege of sitting quietly in one
01:26:42.86 --> 01:26:50.10 place that the uprooting which comes with war is demoralizing.
01:26:50.10 --> 01:26:55.34 The natural officer sees it as an hour of opportunity.
01:26:55.34 --> 01:27:01.62 And though he may not like anything else about war, he at least relishes the strong feeling
01:27:01.62 --> 01:27:08.54 of personal contention which always develop develops when there are many openings inviting
01:27:08.54 --> 01:27:10.70 many men.
01:27:10.70 --> 01:27:17.78 As a world war to commander expressed it, during war, the ball is always kicking around
01:27:17.78 --> 01:27:25.58 loose in the middle of the field and any man who has the will may pick it up and run
01:27:25.58 --> 01:27:30.10 with it.
01:27:30.10 --> 01:27:35.70 That's true by life so many opportunities out there who's going to pick it up and run
01:27:35.70 --> 01:27:39.50 with it becomes the question.
01:27:39.50 --> 01:27:45.42 Now we get into touching back a little bit onto some discipline.
01:27:45.42 --> 01:27:51.30 Back to the book, when men are given absolute freedom, with no compulsion upon them but
01:27:51.30 --> 01:27:59.32 to eat and sleep as with a group of South Sea savages, there can be no strong uniting
01:27:59.32 --> 01:28:06.38 bond between them.
01:28:06.38 --> 01:28:08.74 Absolute freedom doesn't get you what you want.
01:28:08.74 --> 01:28:11.74 There's got to be a counter to that and that counter is discipline.
01:28:11.74 --> 01:28:15.82 I suppose that's another politically incorrect thing that we've run into the book a couple
01:28:15.82 --> 01:28:19.46 times the South Sea savages.
01:28:19.46 --> 01:28:23.22 Who's the technically probably natives from the South Sea?
01:28:23.22 --> 01:28:24.22 Oh, yes.
01:28:24.22 --> 01:28:27.22 In fact, that is who it is.
01:28:27.22 --> 01:28:29.30 Okay, all right, there you go.
01:28:29.30 --> 01:28:34.22 No offense intended.
01:28:34.22 --> 01:28:39.90 Back to the book, in officership there is simply no substitute for personal reconnaissance.
01:28:39.90 --> 01:28:44.86 Do or any other technique that in the long run will have half its value.
01:28:44.86 --> 01:28:47.94 So when he's talking about personal reconnaissance here, he's not talking about going to
01:28:47.94 --> 01:28:50.98 reconniscence of an enemy position.
01:28:50.98 --> 01:28:58.46 He's talking about going down and reconnaissance doing reconnaissance within your own element,
01:28:58.46 --> 01:28:59.46 talking to your people.
01:28:59.46 --> 01:29:01.46 What he's talking about here.
01:29:01.46 --> 01:29:04.86 He's talking about that habit of personal reconnaissance.
01:29:04.86 --> 01:29:11.46 Once formed, the habit of getting down to the roots of organization, of seeing with
01:29:11.46 --> 01:29:17.50 one's own eyes what is taking place, of measuring it against one's own scale of values,
01:29:17.50 --> 01:29:22.66 of ordering such changes as our needed and of following through to make certain that
01:29:22.66 --> 01:29:28.86 the changes are made becomes the main spring of all efficient command action.
01:29:28.86 --> 01:29:32.34 In battle, there is no other way to be sure.
01:29:32.34 --> 01:29:38.58 In training, there is no better way to move towards self assurance.
01:29:38.58 --> 01:29:43.30 So get down there, get in the weed, sometimes see what's going on in the front lines, talk
01:29:43.30 --> 01:29:50.02 to your people.
01:29:50.02 --> 01:29:52.26 This section talks about the mission.
01:29:52.26 --> 01:29:57.66 When an order is given, what are the responsibilities of the man who receives it?
01:29:57.66 --> 01:30:03.30 In sequence, these, to be certain that he understands what is required, to examine and
01:30:03.30 --> 01:30:10.94 organize his resources as promptly as possible, to inform his subordinates upon these points,
01:30:10.94 --> 01:30:17.82 to execute the order without waste of time or means, to call for support if events prove
01:30:17.82 --> 01:30:23.50 that his means are inadequate, to fill up the spaces in the orders if there are developments
01:30:23.50 --> 01:30:26.86 which had not been anticipated.
01:30:26.86 --> 01:30:32.50 When the detail is complete, to prepare to go on to something else.
01:30:32.50 --> 01:30:37.86 Straight forward, Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Morgan, who planned the invasion of Normandy,
01:30:37.86 --> 01:30:42.30 put the matter this way, when setting out on any enterprise.
01:30:42.30 --> 01:30:46.42 It is well, it is as well to ask oneself three questions.
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:49.30 To whom is one responsible?
01:30:49.30 --> 01:30:55.34 For what precisely is one responsible, what are the means that disposable at disposal
01:30:55.34 --> 01:30:58.74 for discharging this responsibility?
01:30:58.74 --> 01:31:01.94 Nothing so warms the heart of a superior.
01:31:01.94 --> 01:31:08.14 As that, on giving an order, he sees his subordinates salute and say, yes, sir, then about
01:31:08.14 --> 01:31:15.66 face and proceed to carry it out to the hilt without faltering or looking back.
01:31:15.66 --> 01:31:20.66 This is the kind of a man that a commander will choose to have with him every time and that
01:31:20.66 --> 01:31:24.14 he will recommend for first advancement.
01:31:24.14 --> 01:31:30.90 On the other hand, clarification of the object is not only a right but a duty and it cuts
01:31:30.90 --> 01:31:32.30 both ways.
01:31:32.30 --> 01:31:38.42 So if you don't understand, you have the duty to ask for clarification.
01:31:38.42 --> 01:31:44.66 Orders are not always clear and no superior is on firm ground when he is inpatient of questions
01:31:44.66 --> 01:31:48.78 which are to the point or resentful of the man who asks him.
01:31:48.78 --> 01:31:50.22 I say this all the time.
01:31:50.22 --> 01:31:54.86 If your subordinates say, why are we doing this and you get angry, you're wrong.
01:31:54.86 --> 01:31:58.70 You should be happy that your subordinates ask him why.
01:31:58.70 --> 01:32:03.82 But it is natural that he will be doubtful of the man who's words show either that he
01:32:03.82 --> 01:32:08.98 hasn't heard or is concerned mainly with the relevancies.
01:32:08.98 --> 01:32:15.30 The cultivation of the habit of careful, concentrated listening and of collected thought
01:32:15.30 --> 01:32:24.06 and reading into any problem is principle, portal to successful officership.
01:32:24.06 --> 01:32:28.34 From the pen of general, Eisenhower comes these words.
01:32:28.34 --> 01:32:35.46 The commander's success will be measured more by his ability to lead than by his adherence
01:32:35.46 --> 01:32:39.54 to fixed notions.
01:32:39.54 --> 01:32:46.74 Thus, in the conduct of operations not less than in the execution of orders, it is necessary
01:32:46.74 --> 01:32:51.38 that the mind remain plastic and impressionable.
01:32:51.38 --> 01:32:57.98 Again, the idea of the military man is this person that can't change and is close-minded.
01:32:57.98 --> 01:32:58.98 It's wrong.
01:32:58.98 --> 01:33:01.86 Now there are military leaders like that.
01:33:01.86 --> 01:33:02.86 And it's unfortunate.
01:33:02.86 --> 01:33:03.86 They're not good.
01:33:03.86 --> 01:33:06.14 You got to have the flexible mind.
01:33:06.14 --> 01:33:07.74 You got to have the plastic mind.
01:33:07.74 --> 01:33:14.66 Obedience is not the product of fear, but of understanding and understanding is based
01:33:14.66 --> 01:33:15.66 on knowledge.
01:33:15.66 --> 01:33:17.78 So you got to make sure that your troops understand what's going on.
01:33:17.78 --> 01:33:18.78 So they know what's going on.
01:33:18.78 --> 01:33:25.06 So they can obey properly, not out of fear.
01:33:25.06 --> 01:33:32.46 To grasp the spirit of orders is not less important than to accept them cheerfully and
01:33:32.46 --> 01:33:36.46 keep faith with the contract.
01:33:36.46 --> 01:33:41.86 But the letter of an instruction does not relieve him who receives it from the obligation
01:33:41.86 --> 01:33:45.18 to exercise common sense.
01:33:45.18 --> 01:33:46.98 You get told to do something you still got to do.
01:33:46.98 --> 01:33:48.86 You still got to hold common sense.
01:33:48.86 --> 01:33:54.54 In the Carolina Manuvers of 1941, a soldier stood at a road intersection for three days
01:33:54.54 --> 01:33:58.42 and nights directing civilian traffic simply because the man who put him there had
01:33:58.42 --> 01:34:00.62 forgotten all about it.
01:34:00.62 --> 01:34:05.10 Though he was praised at the time, he was hardly a shining example of the hold up to
01:34:05.10 --> 01:34:22.90 the troops moving into the next chapter, which the name of the chapter is discipline.
01:34:22.90 --> 01:34:25.86 This is, you're going to recognize this one.
01:34:25.86 --> 01:34:32.90 Once a man condones remisses his own belief in discipline begins to wither.
01:34:32.90 --> 01:34:39.18 The officer who tolerate slackness in the dress of his men soon ceases to tend his own
01:34:39.18 --> 01:34:41.18 appearance.
01:34:41.18 --> 01:34:45.58 And if he is not called to account, his sloppy habits will shortly begin to inflict
01:34:45.58 --> 01:34:48.18 his superior.
01:34:48.18 --> 01:34:50.78 There's only one correct way to wear the uniform.
01:34:50.78 --> 01:34:55.38 When any deviations and dress are condoned within the services, the way is open to the
01:34:55.38 --> 01:34:59.94 destruction of all uniformity and unity.
01:34:59.94 --> 01:35:03.50 It's not what you preach.
01:35:03.50 --> 01:35:07.78 You condoned remisses.
01:35:07.78 --> 01:35:08.78 You're opening.
01:35:08.78 --> 01:35:11.30 Now, this might be a little bit extreme.
01:35:11.30 --> 01:35:15.26 When he says that when you're out of uniform, you allow these units of the way is open
01:35:15.26 --> 01:35:18.06 to the destruction of all uniformity and unity.
01:35:18.06 --> 01:35:20.70 I'm not sure I 100% agree with that.
01:35:20.70 --> 01:35:25.50 And I was always very pro uniform and making sure that guys were square to wear in their
01:35:25.50 --> 01:35:26.50 uniforms.
01:35:26.50 --> 01:35:34.74 With the most stringent in the seal teams, in the seal teams, is not uniforms are not real
01:35:34.74 --> 01:35:38.18 good at wearing uniforms and looking good uniforms and being square to wear uniforms.
01:35:38.18 --> 01:35:42.34 So it's kind of hard for me to agree that that opens up the way for the destruction of all
01:35:42.34 --> 01:35:43.82 uniformity.
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:48.94 But the lesson here is more about the uniforms.
01:35:48.94 --> 01:35:51.26 It's more about just, it's not what you preach.
01:35:51.26 --> 01:35:52.26 It's what you dollar it.
01:35:52.26 --> 01:35:54.26 Yeah, that's slippery slope situation.
01:35:54.26 --> 01:35:55.26 Yes, it is.
01:35:55.26 --> 01:36:00.78 Well, opening the ways it necessarily ensuring something true.
01:36:00.78 --> 01:36:01.78 True.
01:36:01.78 --> 01:36:02.78 True.
01:36:02.78 --> 01:36:04.38 I'll give it to you.
01:36:04.38 --> 01:36:06.78 You get me on the technicality sometimes, that's fine.
01:36:06.78 --> 01:36:09.54 Okay, with that, I'm plastic in my mind.
01:36:09.54 --> 01:36:14.30 I can accept that plastic, you know, some people say plastic like, oh, that guys,
01:36:14.30 --> 01:36:16.74 but plastic, meaning like he's fake or something like that.
01:36:16.74 --> 01:36:17.74 Oh, yeah.
01:36:17.74 --> 01:36:18.74 This is for like plasticity.
01:36:18.74 --> 01:36:20.74 Yes, absolutely.
01:36:20.74 --> 01:36:26.02 In the 1950 before plastic was everything that we used.
01:36:26.02 --> 01:36:31.10 I used to have this theory that anything that was made of metal was better.
01:36:31.10 --> 01:36:32.38 It just made everything of metal.
01:36:32.38 --> 01:36:34.90 I wanted to make everything that was made metal.
01:36:34.90 --> 01:36:35.90 Right.
01:36:35.90 --> 01:36:36.90 Don't they say stuff?
01:36:36.90 --> 01:36:39.18 That's the same thing about like food and bacon.
01:36:39.18 --> 01:36:40.18 Like anything bacon is better.
01:36:40.18 --> 01:36:41.18 Similar.
01:36:41.18 --> 01:36:42.18 Similar.
01:36:42.18 --> 01:36:43.18 It would be correct.
01:36:43.18 --> 01:36:44.18 Yeah.
01:36:44.18 --> 01:36:45.18 It can's good.
01:36:45.18 --> 01:36:47.18 Yeah.
01:36:47.18 --> 01:36:48.18 Back to the book.
01:36:48.18 --> 01:36:49.50 No leader ever fails his men.
01:36:49.50 --> 01:36:55.82 No, they fail him who leads them in respect for the discipline of life.
01:36:55.82 --> 01:37:01.26 Between these two things, discipline in itself and a personal faith in the military value
01:37:01.26 --> 01:37:08.50 of discipline lies all the difference between military maturity and mediocrity.
01:37:08.50 --> 01:37:16.86 A salute from an unwilling man is as meaningless as the moving of a leaf on a tree.
01:37:16.86 --> 01:37:21.50 It is a sign only that the subject has been caught by a gust of wind.
01:37:21.50 --> 01:37:25.78 But a salute from the man who takes pride in the gesture because he feels privileged
01:37:25.78 --> 01:37:30.78 to wear the uniform of the United States having found the service good is the epitome
01:37:30.78 --> 01:37:39.26 of military virtue.
01:37:39.26 --> 01:37:46.78 Until man are severely tried, there is no conclusive test of their discipline nor proof.
01:37:46.78 --> 01:37:54.30 That their training at arms is satisfying a legitimate military end.
01:37:54.30 --> 01:37:58.86 Military forces remain relatively undisciplined until physically toughened and mentally
01:37:58.86 --> 01:38:01.90 conditioned to unusual exertion.
01:38:01.90 --> 01:38:04.90 Consider the road march.
01:38:04.90 --> 01:38:11.34 No body of men could possibly enjoy the dust, the heat, the blistered foot and the aching
01:38:11.34 --> 01:38:17.74 back, but a hard road marching is necessary if a sound foundation is to be built under
01:38:17.74 --> 01:38:25.66 the discipline of fighting forces, particularly those whose labors are in the field.
01:38:25.66 --> 01:38:27.78 And the gain comes quickly.
01:38:27.78 --> 01:38:32.82 The rise in spirits within any organization which is always to be observed after they
01:38:32.82 --> 01:38:37.74 rebound from a hard march does not come essentially from the feeling of relief that the
01:38:37.74 --> 01:38:46.66 strain is passed but rather from the satisfaction that a goal has been crossed.
01:38:46.66 --> 01:38:51.38 It must be accepted that discipline does not break down under the strain of placing a
01:38:51.38 --> 01:38:54.62 testing demand upon the individual.
01:38:54.62 --> 01:39:00.86 It is slough and not activity that destroys discipline.
01:39:00.86 --> 01:39:03.46 Think about that one.
01:39:03.46 --> 01:39:07.70 Although it is not the strain, it is not the pressure that you put that breaks down the
01:39:07.70 --> 01:39:11.94 discipline, it is the laziness, it is the slough that breaks discipline.
01:39:11.94 --> 01:39:17.22 Troops can endure hard going when it serves an understandable end.
01:39:17.22 --> 01:39:19.54 This is what they will boast about.
01:39:19.54 --> 01:39:23.74 Mainly when the fatigue is ended, a large part of training is necessarily directed toward
01:39:23.74 --> 01:39:28.02 conditioning them for unusual hardship and privation.
01:39:28.02 --> 01:39:33.14 They can take it and stride, but no power on earth can reconcile them to what common sense
01:39:33.14 --> 01:39:37.94 tells them is unnecessary hardship which might have been avoided by greater intelligence
01:39:37.94 --> 01:39:40.46 in their superiors.
01:39:40.46 --> 01:39:43.66 If you are telling people to do something, they realize that there is an easier way to do
01:39:43.66 --> 01:39:45.02 it.
01:39:45.02 --> 01:39:50.58 They are going to be angry when they are overloaded, they know it.
01:39:50.58 --> 01:39:55.58 When they are required to form a parade two hours ahead of time because their commander got
01:39:55.58 --> 01:40:00.90 over anxious or didn't know how to write an order, again, they know it.
01:40:00.90 --> 01:40:04.94 They are perfectly right if they go sour because this kind of thing happens a little too
01:40:04.94 --> 01:40:09.46 often within the command.
01:40:09.46 --> 01:40:17.26 Within our system, that discipline is nearest perfect which assures to the individual, the
01:40:17.26 --> 01:40:22.78 greatest freedom of thought and action.
01:40:22.78 --> 01:40:29.82 While at all times promoting his feeling of responsibility toward the group, the red,
01:40:29.82 --> 01:40:35.18 do you hear about the greatest form of discipline is the one that gives the greatest freedom
01:40:35.18 --> 01:40:36.94 of thought and action?
01:40:36.94 --> 01:40:37.94 That's what we want.
01:40:37.94 --> 01:40:44.70 We want the discipline to equal freedom.
01:40:44.70 --> 01:40:50.18 That's interesting his take on like when you go through some hard stuff, the satisfaction
01:40:50.18 --> 01:40:51.46 isn't that it's over.
01:40:51.46 --> 01:40:54.46 It's the fact that you did that absolutely.
01:40:54.46 --> 01:40:58.14 Yeah, it's like, you know, I told you, it might hold sleep.
01:40:58.14 --> 01:41:03.22 I mean, we'll use to be it worth if I didn't get my half hours done for the day.
01:41:03.22 --> 01:41:07.54 But so now let's say I get two hours sleep.
01:41:07.54 --> 01:41:10.34 And I'm like, hey, I'm gonna still do this work.
01:41:10.34 --> 01:41:13.38 I would do whatever this condition is something hard.
01:41:13.38 --> 01:41:14.38 Sure, it's gonna be hard.
01:41:14.38 --> 01:41:15.38 Sure, I'm not looking forward to it.
01:41:15.38 --> 01:41:19.62 But yeah, the satisfaction is afterwards all you can go to, how it's at it, you're gonna
01:41:19.62 --> 01:41:20.62 have something to brag about.
01:41:20.62 --> 01:41:22.58 If there's something like that, that's true.
01:41:22.58 --> 01:41:26.22 You go and tell your friends, hey, I did this way only to hours sleep.
01:41:26.22 --> 01:41:27.22 Got it.
01:41:27.22 --> 01:41:30.54 Yeah, you do kind of have that feeling like you want to brag about it.
01:41:30.54 --> 01:41:31.54 No doubt.
01:41:31.54 --> 01:41:32.90 Like I did some hard stuff.
01:41:32.90 --> 01:41:35.18 You know, we shouldn't be surprised.
01:41:35.18 --> 01:41:39.78 We're kind of getting excited when these things completely make sense.
01:41:39.78 --> 01:41:46.34 These are, these are generals that knew and understand human nature.
01:41:46.34 --> 01:41:50.70 And these are things that we look at and we learn and we've experienced.
01:41:50.70 --> 01:41:52.10 So it shouldn't come as a surprise.
01:41:52.10 --> 01:41:53.10 Yeah, I know.
01:41:53.10 --> 01:41:54.10 It's crazy.
01:41:54.10 --> 01:41:58.14 It's like tunnel vision, you know, where it'll happen and you almost like you don't
01:41:58.14 --> 01:41:59.34 even realize it'll happen.
01:41:59.34 --> 01:42:00.34 Everyone does that.
01:42:00.34 --> 01:42:01.34 Everyone does something for hard.
01:42:01.34 --> 01:42:02.34 For sure.
01:42:02.34 --> 01:42:04.78 Get through hard work day, did something under these circumstances.
01:42:04.78 --> 01:42:05.78 That they hate.
01:42:05.78 --> 01:42:07.50 They might even be complaining about it.
01:42:07.50 --> 01:42:10.18 Like, oh, this was going on so such a stressful day.
01:42:10.18 --> 01:42:13.82 But when you get it actually done, you brag about it.
01:42:13.82 --> 01:42:16.58 At the very least, you feel like you want to brag about it.
01:42:16.58 --> 01:42:21.50 And keep that good person that, you know, keep that up.
01:42:21.50 --> 01:42:22.98 Now there's some counter to that.
01:42:22.98 --> 01:42:23.98 Here we go.
01:42:23.98 --> 01:42:29.30 Back to the book, if the man is cramped by monotonous routine or made to feel that he
01:42:29.30 --> 01:42:34.90 cannot move unless an order is barked, he cannot develop these qualities and he will never
01:42:34.90 --> 01:42:36.22 come forward as a junior leader.
01:42:36.22 --> 01:42:40.98 So if you put too much discipline on somebody, they're going to your crept their leadership
01:42:40.98 --> 01:42:41.98 up capabilities.
01:42:41.98 --> 01:42:45.02 Say that all the time.
01:42:45.02 --> 01:42:50.94 In the words of dupeque, who saw so deeply into the hearts of fighting men, if one does
01:42:50.94 --> 01:43:00.18 not wish bonds broken, one should make them elastic and thereby strengthen them.
01:43:00.18 --> 01:43:02.18 That's a guy.
01:43:02.18 --> 01:43:05.26 He wrote a thing called the battle studies.
01:43:05.26 --> 01:43:11.26 Well, actually, he didn't finish writing it because he got killed in action, fighting
01:43:11.26 --> 01:43:14.46 fighting.
01:43:14.46 --> 01:43:20.62 Napoleon, he was French, fighting again in the, say fighting the Russians.
01:43:20.62 --> 01:43:28.50 But yet another great quote from him that I wrote down, nothing can be, nothing can wisely
01:43:28.50 --> 01:43:36.94 be prescribed in any army without exact knowledge of the fundamental instrument of man
01:43:36.94 --> 01:43:42.82 and the state of mind, his morale at the instant of combat.
01:43:42.82 --> 01:43:48.26 So to peak is a guy that really started looking at the mentality of guys.
01:43:48.26 --> 01:43:52.74 We might have to get it.
01:43:52.74 --> 01:43:55.38 We might have to dive into him at some point.
01:43:55.38 --> 01:44:00.70 Now, speaking of morale, the next section is about morale.
01:44:00.70 --> 01:44:03.70 A word war to blue jacket said it this way.
01:44:03.70 --> 01:44:07.26 Blue jacket's turn for Navy guys said it this way.
01:44:07.26 --> 01:44:13.38 Morales when your hands and feet keep working when your head says it can't be done.
01:44:13.38 --> 01:44:18.34 The handiest beginning is to consider morale and conjunction with discipline.
01:44:18.34 --> 01:44:23.38 Since in military service, their opposite sides of the same coin, when one is present,
01:44:23.38 --> 01:44:28.10 the other will also be there.
01:44:28.10 --> 01:44:30.50 Moral and discipline.
01:44:30.50 --> 01:44:34.22 Moral and discipline, they go together.
01:44:34.22 --> 01:44:35.50 This is a familiar story.
01:44:35.50 --> 01:44:39.14 It was repeated by the United States forces in World War II during the Normandy had
01:44:39.14 --> 01:44:44.22 road fighting and the invasions of the Central Pacific atolls.
01:44:44.22 --> 01:44:49.46 Troops had to learn the hard way how to hit, how to survive, in moving through jungle
01:44:49.46 --> 01:44:52.22 or cross mountains in the desert.
01:44:52.22 --> 01:44:58.26 When that happened, the only disciplinary residue which mattered was obedience to orders.
01:44:58.26 --> 01:45:05.02 The movements they had learned by rope were of less value than the spiritual bond between
01:45:05.02 --> 01:45:08.02 one man and another.
01:45:08.02 --> 01:45:12.26 The most valuable lesson was that of mutual support.
01:45:12.26 --> 01:45:15.26 So, this is awesome.
01:45:15.26 --> 01:45:19.78 The moves, the battle moves that they learned, that they trained, that were hard and put
01:45:19.78 --> 01:45:22.58 them through this hard, getting ready to deploy overseas.
01:45:22.58 --> 01:45:24.98 When they got overseas, they were fighting in a hedger, they never did that before, they're
01:45:24.98 --> 01:45:26.86 fighting in a mountain, they never did that before.
01:45:26.86 --> 01:45:30.78 So they had to take these drills that they had learned and kind of throw them out the window.
01:45:30.78 --> 01:45:35.74 So all they had left and the most valuable thing of all that training wasn't to move
01:45:35.74 --> 01:45:40.46 in themselves, it was the spiritual bond between these men.
01:45:40.46 --> 01:45:43.98 That was more important than the tactical maneuvers, was the fact that they did hard training
01:45:43.98 --> 01:45:49.98 together and they worked together and they knew each other and had that spiritual bond.
01:45:49.98 --> 01:45:54.58 Back to the book, in its essentials discipline is not measured according to how a man
01:45:54.58 --> 01:46:00.06 keeps step in a drill yard or whether he salutes it just the right angle.
01:46:00.06 --> 01:46:07.66 The test is how well he willingly responds to his superior in all vital matters and finally,
01:46:07.66 --> 01:46:12.70 whether he stands or runs when his life is at stake.
01:46:12.70 --> 01:46:17.98 History makes this clear, there are countless examples of successful military forces
01:46:17.98 --> 01:46:23.26 which had almost no discipline when measured by the usual yard sticks.
01:46:23.26 --> 01:46:31.30 It had a high battle morale, productive of the kind of discipline which beats the enemy in battle.
01:46:31.30 --> 01:46:33.62 So that's another little dichotomy, you know, they've talked about it.
01:46:33.62 --> 01:46:38.26 You might not be the most disciplined on the parade field, but if you've got that bond
01:46:38.26 --> 01:46:44.46 and you've got that discipline bond, you can still come up with the victory.
01:46:44.46 --> 01:46:46.46 This is important.
01:46:46.46 --> 01:46:52.26 Back to the book, man is able to recognize a right and reasonable discipline as such, even though
01:46:52.26 --> 01:46:59.26 it causes him personal inconvenience because he's acquired a sense of military values.
01:46:59.26 --> 01:47:10.14 But if it is either unduly harsh or unnecessarily lacks, he likewise knows it and
01:47:10.14 --> 01:47:16.14 wears it as a hair shirt to the undoing of his morale.
01:47:16.14 --> 01:47:23.02 So the man, like the group, can be hurt by being pushed beyond sensible limits, his spirit
01:47:23.02 --> 01:47:25.86 will suffer even more sorely.
01:47:25.86 --> 01:47:30.94 If no real test is put upon his abilities and moral powers.
01:47:30.94 --> 01:47:35.58 The greater his intelligence, the stronger will be his resentment.
01:47:35.58 --> 01:47:37.30 That is the law of nature.
01:47:37.30 --> 01:47:43.06 The enlightened mind has always the greatest measure of self-discipline, but it also has
01:47:43.06 --> 01:47:49.38 a higher sense of what constitutes justice, fair play and a reasonable requirement in the
01:47:49.38 --> 01:47:52.42 performance of duty.
01:47:52.42 --> 01:48:02.46 If denied these things, he will come to hold his chief, his job and himself in contempt.
01:48:02.46 --> 01:48:05.18 So if you get the if you're a military leader or if you're a civilian leader and you get
01:48:05.18 --> 01:48:08.70 the idea, okay, Jockel, talking about discipline, discipline's key, so you're going to come
01:48:08.70 --> 01:48:14.58 in and just throw discipline on your people and burden them with this heavy realm of discipline,
01:48:14.58 --> 01:48:19.22 it's not going to work out because everyone knows that it's unjust unfair.
01:48:19.22 --> 01:48:21.50 Unnecessary.
01:48:21.50 --> 01:48:25.50 We don't want that unnecessary discipline, but we embrace women.
01:48:25.50 --> 01:48:29.62 I will believe that we deep inside, we embrace the hardcore discipline if it makes sense
01:48:29.62 --> 01:48:36.50 and has meaning.
01:48:36.50 --> 01:48:41.70 Admiral Ben Moril has stated a formula in understanding terms by his explanation of what
01:48:41.70 --> 01:48:46.74 made the CB's notable for competence and devotion to duty during World War II.
01:48:46.74 --> 01:48:51.38 What he said is this, we used artisans to do the work for which they had been trained in civilian
01:48:51.38 --> 01:48:53.10 life.
01:48:53.10 --> 01:48:56.06 They were well led by officers who spoke their language.
01:48:56.06 --> 01:49:01.18 We made them feel that they were playing an important part in a great adventure and thus
01:49:01.18 --> 01:49:04.30 they achieved a high standard of morale.
01:49:04.30 --> 01:49:10.50 The elements underscored by Admiral Moril deserve special note, saddest faction in a work
01:49:10.50 --> 01:49:16.62 program, mutual confidence between leaders and ranks conviction that all together were striving
01:49:16.62 --> 01:49:19.82 for something more important than themselves.
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:27.42 Talk about the CB's, the construction battines and the Navy that do engineering work overseas
01:49:27.42 --> 01:49:33.10 and I actually had CB's with us in a remedy that were awesome, awesome guys that didn't
01:49:33.10 --> 01:49:38.62 everything for us, they kept everything going, kept everything running, kept everything working,
01:49:38.62 --> 01:49:45.10 built everything that we used awesome guys and every CB I've ever worked with has been
01:49:45.10 --> 01:49:48.06 just a beast, they have that attitude.
01:49:48.06 --> 01:49:52.82 They know they're gonna, their motto is can't do and believe me when you tell them to
01:49:52.82 --> 01:49:58.82 do something, they're 100% into that motto right there, they're gonna make it happen.
01:49:58.82 --> 01:50:01.58 Here we go back to the book, talking about Moril.
01:50:01.58 --> 01:50:06.78 Training conditions are in combat, the mental ills and the resulting morale, moral and
01:50:06.78 --> 01:50:12.62 physical deterioration which sometimes be set military forces cannot be cured simply
01:50:12.62 --> 01:50:16.38 by the intensification of disciplinary methods.
01:50:16.38 --> 01:50:18.42 Can't just turn it up.
01:50:18.42 --> 01:50:24.42 It is true that the signs of recovery will sometimes attend the installation of a more rigid
01:50:24.42 --> 01:50:27.18 or less rigid discipline.
01:50:27.18 --> 01:50:29.70 You can't just go up or down.
01:50:29.70 --> 01:50:35.02 The onset is in fact usually due to the collateral influence of an increased confidence
01:50:35.02 --> 01:50:42.58 in the command, whereby men are made to feel that their own fortunes are on the mend.
01:50:42.58 --> 01:50:48.62 Then discipline and morale are together revitalized almost as if by throwing an electric
01:50:48.62 --> 01:50:51.02 switch.
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:56.14 In Army history there's no better example of the working of this principle than the
01:50:56.14 --> 01:51:00.38 work of Brigadier General Paul B. Malone.
01:51:00.38 --> 01:51:03.62 He took over, this is World War I, 1919.
01:51:03.62 --> 01:51:08.38 He took over a command where slackness and indiscipline were general.
01:51:08.38 --> 01:51:12.38 The men were suffering terrible privation and too many of their officers were indifferent
01:51:12.38 --> 01:51:14.26 to their needs.
01:51:14.26 --> 01:51:18.06 Many of them had been battle casualties, some had been discharged from hospitals before
01:51:18.06 --> 01:51:21.50 their wounds were healed, the mess was abominable.
01:51:21.50 --> 01:51:26.34 The camp was short of firewood and other supply, in freezing weather, men were sleeping
01:51:26.34 --> 01:51:30.18 on the ground with only a pair of blankets of peace.
01:51:30.18 --> 01:51:36.46 The death toll from influenza pneumonia and the aggravation of battle wounds rose daily.
01:51:36.46 --> 01:51:43.30 The spare and resentment over these conditions began to express itself in semi-violent form.
01:51:43.30 --> 01:51:47.78 Every fresh breath of discipline was counted with harassing punishments until an air of
01:51:47.78 --> 01:51:52.22 wretched stagnation hung over the whole camp.
01:51:52.22 --> 01:51:54.94 General purging visited the base.
01:51:54.94 --> 01:51:59.02 The men refused to form for him.
01:51:59.02 --> 01:52:02.98 The men were through the generals coming in the men were not going to form up for him.
01:52:02.98 --> 01:52:07.26 When he tried to address them at a mass meeting they wouldn't hear him out.
01:52:07.26 --> 01:52:12.42 Instead of taking any action against the men he sent for general Malone.
01:52:12.42 --> 01:52:16.10 The new commander arrived without any instructions except to determine what was wrong and
01:52:16.10 --> 01:52:17.58 correct it.
01:52:17.58 --> 01:52:23.94 It's sogently instinct he recognized that the indiscipline of the camp was an effect
01:52:23.94 --> 01:52:26.46 and not a cause.
01:52:26.46 --> 01:52:30.46 But even as he gave orders for leaving the physical distress of the men he demanded
01:52:30.46 --> 01:52:32.58 that they returned to orderly habits.
01:52:32.58 --> 01:52:35.94 He walked around the areas already on his orders.
01:52:35.94 --> 01:52:39.22 On his orders duckboards were being laid throughout the mud.
01:52:39.22 --> 01:52:42.66 And the whole physical setup was in a process of reorganization.
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:48.10 The men, grown listless from weeks of mistreatment, paid no heed.
01:52:48.10 --> 01:52:49.10 Get on your feet.
01:52:49.10 --> 01:52:50.10 I'm your general.
01:52:50.10 --> 01:52:54.26 I respect you but I want your respect to where his words.
01:52:54.26 --> 01:52:56.90 They restored the whole situation.
01:52:56.90 --> 01:53:01.74 The first impact of this one man on the camp that was never forgotten by anyone who saw
01:53:01.74 --> 01:53:03.38 it.
01:53:03.38 --> 01:53:09.34 It is a point to remember, a firm hold at the beginning pays tenfold dividend of the
01:53:09.34 --> 01:53:11.62 timid approach.
01:53:11.62 --> 01:53:14.58 World by a show of firmness later on.
01:53:14.58 --> 01:53:20.10 Within 48 hours the physical condition of the camp was showing improvement and 60,000 men
01:53:20.10 --> 01:53:25.14 were again doing their duty and bearing themselves in a military manner.
01:53:25.14 --> 01:53:32.58 The lessons from this one incident stand out like beams from a search light battery.
01:53:32.58 --> 01:53:37.06 Leadership.
01:53:37.06 --> 01:53:43.58 One man is able to accomplish a miracle by an active will accompanied by good works.
01:53:43.58 --> 01:53:48.94 The morale of the force flows from self-discipline of the commander.
01:53:48.94 --> 01:53:58.06 And in turn the discipline of the force is reestablished by the upsurge of its moral power.
01:53:58.06 --> 01:54:02.06 Another example here, when the redeployment period which followed World War II threatened
01:54:02.06 --> 01:54:06.46 to complete collapse to the morale of the general military establishment, the remedy
01:54:06.46 --> 01:54:13.46 attempted by some unit leaders was to relax discipline and the work requirement all around.
01:54:13.46 --> 01:54:17.58 Other officers met this crisis by improving the conditions of work, setting an example
01:54:17.58 --> 01:54:22.42 which proved to the men that they believed in its importance and paying sensuous attention
01:54:22.42 --> 01:54:25.98 to the personal problems of those within the unit.
01:54:25.98 --> 01:54:31.06 They found that they could still get superior performance in the midst of chaos, organic
01:54:31.06 --> 01:54:35.98 strength materializes in the same way on the field of war.
01:54:35.98 --> 01:54:42.14 However, adverse the general situation, men will stick to the one man who knows what he wants
01:54:42.14 --> 01:54:51.26 to do and welcomes them to a full share in the enterprise.
01:54:51.26 --> 01:54:54.90 Leadership, leadership and leadership.
01:54:54.90 --> 01:55:00.94 Most important thing on the battlefield.
01:55:00.94 --> 01:55:06.46 In the words of Colonel G. F. R. Henderson, it is the leader who reckons with the human
01:55:06.46 --> 01:55:12.50 nature of his troops and of the enemy rather than with their mere physical attributes,
01:55:12.50 --> 01:55:17.98 numbers, armament and the like who can hope to follow in Napoleon's footsteps.
01:55:17.98 --> 01:55:20.50 Got to know your people, got to know human nature.
01:55:20.50 --> 01:55:22.50 Got to know human nature.
01:55:22.50 --> 01:55:25.78 It's more important than physical, more important than people you got.
01:55:25.78 --> 01:55:32.78 More important than their weapons, human nature.
01:55:32.78 --> 01:55:37.86 There are a few governing principles and before considering their application in detail,
01:55:37.86 --> 01:55:40.78 we should first think about the file.
01:55:40.78 --> 01:55:43.54 So now we're talking about a guy, a troop, a soldier.
01:55:43.54 --> 01:55:45.54 He is a man.
01:55:45.54 --> 01:55:49.46 He expects to be treated as an adult, not a school boy.
01:55:49.46 --> 01:55:50.70 He has rights.
01:55:50.70 --> 01:55:55.74 They must be made known to him and thereafter respected.
01:55:55.74 --> 01:55:57.58 He has ambition.
01:55:57.58 --> 01:55:59.74 It must be stirred.
01:55:59.74 --> 01:56:02.34 He has a belief in fair play.
01:56:02.34 --> 01:56:04.98 It must be honored.
01:56:04.98 --> 01:56:07.78 He has the need of comrade ship.
01:56:07.78 --> 01:56:10.26 It must be supplied.
01:56:10.26 --> 01:56:12.78 He has imagination.
01:56:12.78 --> 01:56:14.50 It must be stimulated.
01:56:14.50 --> 01:56:17.06 He has a personal sense of dignity.
01:56:17.06 --> 01:56:20.74 It must not be broken down.
01:56:20.74 --> 01:56:23.06 He has pride.
01:56:23.06 --> 01:56:28.46 It can be satisfied and made the bedrock of his character once he gains assurance that
01:56:28.46 --> 01:56:35.50 he is playing a useful and respected part in a superior and successful organization.
01:56:35.50 --> 01:56:40.18 To give men working as a group, the feeling of great accomplishment together is the
01:56:40.18 --> 01:56:45.14 acne of inspired leadership.
01:56:45.14 --> 01:56:48.70 You could basically, if you're going into a leadership position, just read that to yourself
01:56:48.70 --> 01:56:50.70 every morning.
01:56:50.70 --> 01:56:54.22 Just what your support and what they are.
01:56:54.22 --> 01:56:58.46 A man, be treated as adult, not a school boy.
01:56:58.46 --> 01:57:04.30 Those are just so important the way you view your troops.
01:57:04.30 --> 01:57:06.30 Some people have a hard time with that.
01:57:06.30 --> 01:57:12.10 Some people have a hard time with that.
01:57:12.10 --> 01:57:17.46 Next section is called knowing your job.
01:57:17.46 --> 01:57:25.30 In one of his little known passages, Robert Lewis Stevenson, Dr. Jackalomester Hyde,
01:57:25.30 --> 01:57:31.18 and the perfect portrait of the man who finally failed in everything because he never
01:57:31.18 --> 01:57:33.78 learned how to take hold of his work.
01:57:33.78 --> 01:57:35.46 It goes like this.
01:57:35.46 --> 01:57:39.78 His career was one of Unbroken Shame.
01:57:39.78 --> 01:57:41.30 He did not drink.
01:57:41.30 --> 01:57:42.82 He was exactly honest.
01:57:42.82 --> 01:57:45.66 He was never rude to his employers.
01:57:45.66 --> 01:57:48.94 He was everywhere discharged.
01:57:48.94 --> 01:57:54.78 Bringing no interest to his duties, he brought no attention.
01:57:54.78 --> 01:58:01.22 His day was a tissue of things neglected and things done a mess.
01:58:01.22 --> 01:58:06.74 And from place to place and from town to town, he carried the character of one thoroughly
01:58:06.74 --> 01:58:10.54 incompetent.
01:58:10.54 --> 01:58:11.70 That's how we started this conversation.
01:58:11.70 --> 01:58:15.02 Today we started talking about doing your job.
01:58:15.02 --> 01:58:17.58 Now this is important.
01:58:17.58 --> 01:58:23.70 Just as a rough approximation, any officers work week should comprise about 50% execution
01:58:23.70 --> 01:58:30.10 and the other half study if he is to make the best use of his force.
01:58:30.10 --> 01:58:35.82 The woods are loaded with go-getters who claim they are men of action and therefore have
01:58:35.82 --> 01:58:38.06 no need of books.
01:58:38.06 --> 01:58:40.10 We're talking about studying.
01:58:40.10 --> 01:58:43.46 We're talking about reading and studying.
01:58:43.46 --> 01:58:50.26 These guys that say that there's no need for books, they are of the same bone and marrow
01:58:50.26 --> 01:58:55.30 as the drone who is always counseling half-speed.
01:58:55.30 --> 01:58:56.50 Don't sweat.
01:58:56.50 --> 01:58:57.74 Just get by.
01:58:57.74 --> 01:58:59.42 Extra work means short life.
01:58:59.42 --> 01:59:03.14 You're better off if they don't notice you.
01:59:03.14 --> 01:59:06.18 This chant can be heard by anyone who cares to listen.
01:59:06.18 --> 01:59:11.26 It's the old American invitation and mediocrity.
01:59:11.26 --> 01:59:14.78 But not always them is to be found in books.
01:59:14.78 --> 01:59:18.86 And at no time is this more true than when one is breaking in.
01:59:18.86 --> 01:59:26.34 What is expected of any novice in any field is that he will ask questions.
01:59:26.34 --> 01:59:30.90 Smart ones if possible, but if not, then questions of all kinds until he learns that there
01:59:30.90 --> 01:59:35.26 is no such item as revely oil.
01:59:35.26 --> 01:59:39.70 And that skirmish line doesn't come on spools.
01:59:39.70 --> 01:59:43.26 So revely oil, revely is when you wake up in the morning.
01:59:43.26 --> 01:59:46.26 And revely oil is something that doesn't actually exist.
01:59:46.26 --> 01:59:49.30 But you'd say to a new guy, we need to get some revely oil for tomorrow.
01:59:49.30 --> 01:59:50.74 Can you go down to supply and get it for me?
01:59:50.74 --> 01:59:55.90 Or skirmish line to skirmish line is when you get online to engage the enemy.
01:59:55.90 --> 01:59:57.94 Get online and put your guns in the same direction.
01:59:57.94 --> 01:59:59.94 That's called a skirmish line.
01:59:59.94 --> 02:00:02.26 Well, he said, hey, we need a spool, a skirmish line.
02:00:02.26 --> 02:00:05.58 Echo, can you run down to the supply department and get us a roller skirmish line?
02:00:05.58 --> 02:00:07.54 That's kind of like little practical jokes.
02:00:07.54 --> 02:00:09.66 But his point is, here, people ask me to solve them.
02:00:09.66 --> 02:00:10.66 Well, you know, I just checked in.
02:00:10.66 --> 02:00:11.66 I'm just taking over as leader.
02:00:11.66 --> 02:00:12.86 I'm just, you know, I'm a new officer.
02:00:12.86 --> 02:00:13.86 I'm getting commissioned.
02:00:13.86 --> 02:00:14.86 What should I do?
02:00:14.86 --> 02:00:15.86 How should I lead?
02:00:15.86 --> 02:00:16.86 Ask questions.
02:00:16.86 --> 02:00:17.50 There's nothing wrong with it.
02:00:17.50 --> 02:00:21.30 There's nothing wrong with it.
02:00:21.30 --> 02:00:22.30 Back to the book.
02:00:22.30 --> 02:00:30.38 Wisdom begins at the point of understanding that there is nothing shameful about ignorance.
02:00:30.38 --> 02:00:35.70 It is shameful only when a man would rather remain in that state than cultivate other
02:00:35.70 --> 02:00:37.46 men's knowledge.
02:00:37.46 --> 02:00:42.78 There is never any reason why he should hesitate for his better to be embarrassed from seeking
02:00:42.78 --> 02:00:51.06 counsel than to be found short for not having sought it.
02:00:51.06 --> 02:00:56.78 Ideally, any officer should be able to do the work of any man under him.
02:00:56.78 --> 02:01:03.34 However, it is obviously absurd to expect that any officer could know more about radio repair
02:01:03.34 --> 02:01:04.66 than his repairman.
02:01:04.66 --> 02:01:13.30 For about mapping than his cartographical section, more about moving parts than a gunsmith,
02:01:13.30 --> 02:01:20.38 more about radar than a specialist in electronics, and more about cipher than a cryptographer.
02:01:20.38 --> 02:01:24.74 The distinction lies in the difference between the power to do a thing well and that of
02:01:24.74 --> 02:01:28.26 being able to judge when it is done well.
02:01:28.26 --> 02:01:33.34 A man can say a book is bad, though not knowing how to write one himself provided he
02:01:33.34 --> 02:01:39.58 is a student of literature, though he is never laid in egg he can pass fair judgment
02:01:39.58 --> 02:01:42.94 on an omelet.
02:01:42.94 --> 02:01:46.70 So this is another thing, you know, you're not going to know everything as a leader.
02:01:46.70 --> 02:01:52.66 You know, that I know as much about sniper, sniping as my sniper did I even know close.
02:01:52.66 --> 02:01:56.90 You know, that I know as much about, just like he said, I was much about the radio, is
02:01:56.90 --> 02:01:57.90 my radio-mended?
02:01:57.90 --> 02:02:01.78 No, no, close to what they knew.
02:02:01.78 --> 02:02:05.46 You don't need to know everything, but you have to have an understanding of it.
02:02:05.46 --> 02:02:12.98 And you have to at least be able to understand that something is being done right or wrong.
02:02:12.98 --> 02:02:14.10 This is another good point.
02:02:14.10 --> 02:02:19.30 We can ponder the words of William Hazlet, a man who shrinks from a collision with his
02:02:19.30 --> 02:02:23.90 equals of superiors will soon sink below himself.
02:02:23.90 --> 02:02:30.58 We improve by trying our strength with others, not by showing it off.
02:02:30.58 --> 02:02:33.78 So you can't be afraid to bring stuff up to your superiors.
02:02:33.78 --> 02:02:34.78 Do you got to be respectful?
02:02:34.78 --> 02:02:36.70 Yes, you do.
02:02:36.70 --> 02:02:41.82 But instead of just being a yes man, don't be that.
02:02:41.82 --> 02:02:48.26 Now this next section.
02:02:48.26 --> 02:02:52.58 It's called writing and speaking.
02:02:52.58 --> 02:02:57.90 Other things being equal a superior rating will invariably be given to the officer who
02:02:57.90 --> 02:03:03.50 is preserved in his studies of the art of self-expression.
02:03:03.50 --> 02:03:07.82 While his colleague who attaches little importance to what may be achieved through working
02:03:07.82 --> 02:03:12.22 with the language will be marked for mediocrity.
02:03:12.22 --> 02:03:17.78 So we're talking about reading and speaking, writing and speaking.
02:03:17.78 --> 02:03:25.38 As the British statesman does Rayleigh put it, men govern with words.
02:03:25.38 --> 02:03:31.78 Within the military establishment command is exercised through what is said, which commands
02:03:31.78 --> 02:03:39.50 attention and understanding and through what is written, which directs, explains, interprets
02:03:39.50 --> 02:03:42.02 or informs.
02:03:42.02 --> 02:03:49.94 Battles are one through the ability of men to express concrete ideas in clear and unmistakable
02:03:49.94 --> 02:03:54.90 language.
02:03:54.90 --> 02:03:59.26 Battles are one through clear and unmistakable language.
02:03:59.26 --> 02:04:01.22 That's how battles are one.
02:04:01.22 --> 02:04:05.86 Back to the book, all administration is carried forward along the chain of command by the
02:04:05.86 --> 02:04:12.50 power of men to make their thoughts articulate and available to others.
02:04:12.50 --> 02:04:19.06 There is no way under the sun that this basic condition can be altered.
02:04:19.06 --> 02:04:23.18 Once the point is granted, any officer should be ready to accept its corollary.
02:04:23.18 --> 02:04:28.66 That superior qualification in the use of language both as to the written and the spoken
02:04:28.66 --> 02:04:34.58 word is more essential to military leadership than knowledge of the whole technique of weapons
02:04:34.58 --> 02:04:38.38 handling.
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:43.18 So when people ask me why I studied English in college, this is why I studied English
02:04:43.18 --> 02:04:47.78 in college.
02:04:47.78 --> 02:04:53.78 Some men will take refuge in the excuse offered by the great majority.
02:04:53.78 --> 02:04:59.62 I'm just a simple fighting file with no gift for writing or speaking.
02:04:59.62 --> 02:05:05.86 That is the mark of an officer who has no ambition to properly qualify himself and is seeking
02:05:05.86 --> 02:05:11.14 to justify his own laziness.
02:05:11.14 --> 02:05:16.22 And the reason he's saying that is because he thinks that you can become a good writer.
02:05:16.22 --> 02:05:19.82 Back to the book, writers are self-made.
02:05:19.82 --> 02:05:25.74 But it is a reasonable speculation that history might never have heard of the greater number
02:05:25.74 --> 02:05:27.66 of these men.
02:05:27.66 --> 02:05:38.14 Had they not worked sedulously to become proficient with the pen as well as with the sword.
02:05:38.14 --> 02:05:43.86 Men who command words to serve their thoughts and feelings are well on their way to
02:05:43.86 --> 02:05:47.22 commanding men to serve their purposes.
02:05:47.22 --> 02:05:54.86 All senior commanders respect the junior who has a faculty for thinking and idea through
02:05:54.86 --> 02:05:59.38 and then expressing it comprehensively and clear, unvarnished phases.
02:05:59.38 --> 02:06:06.26 So your young young leader out there, young trooper, think about improving your method
02:06:06.26 --> 02:06:12.58 of thought, think about making your speech more clear.
02:06:12.58 --> 02:06:18.94 Many men who has the brain to qualify for commission can make of himself a competent writer.
02:06:18.94 --> 02:06:23.26 Because of natural limitations, he may never excel in this art, but if he has had average
02:06:23.26 --> 02:06:27.78 schooling, knows how to open a dictionary, can find his way to the library and is willing
02:06:27.78 --> 02:06:33.26 to commit himself to long study and practice, particularly in non-duty hours, and will
02:06:33.26 --> 02:06:38.66 finally free himself from the superstition that writing is a game only for specialists.
02:06:38.66 --> 02:06:44.06 He can acquire all the skill that is necessary to further his advance within the military
02:06:44.06 --> 02:06:46.50 profession.
02:06:46.50 --> 02:06:51.78 But where should work begin, how about a little practical advice?
02:06:51.78 --> 02:06:56.98 The only way to learn to write is to write.
02:06:56.98 --> 02:06:58.26 That's it.
02:06:58.26 --> 02:07:05.10 There's no other secret, other than hard, unremitting practice.
02:07:05.10 --> 02:07:10.34 Most writers at the start are mentally muscle bound and poorly coordinated.
02:07:10.34 --> 02:07:13.06 They have thoughts in their head.
02:07:13.06 --> 02:07:18.06 They think they can develop them clearly, but when they try to apply a largely dormant
02:07:18.06 --> 02:07:24.38 vocabulary to the expression of these thoughts, the result is stiff and self-conscious.
02:07:24.38 --> 02:07:25.94 Self-conscious.
02:07:25.94 --> 02:07:33.30 The only cure for this is constant mental exercise with one's pen or over one's type
02:07:33.30 --> 02:07:35.90 writer.
02:07:35.90 --> 02:07:41.98 The discipline, through which one learns to write adds substance to thought, whereby one's
02:07:41.98 --> 02:07:46.46 ideas are given body and connection.
02:07:46.46 --> 02:07:52.22 Such common faults as worreness over statement, faulty sentence structure and weak
02:07:52.22 --> 02:08:00.10 use of words are gradually corrected with their passing confidence grows.
02:08:00.10 --> 02:08:05.54 This does not mean however that the task becomes easy.
02:08:05.54 --> 02:08:08.02 So you can get better this game.
02:08:08.02 --> 02:08:09.02 You just got to practice.
02:08:09.02 --> 02:08:10.26 Kind of like getting better at pull ups.
02:08:10.26 --> 02:08:11.26 I get better at pull ups.
02:08:11.26 --> 02:08:12.26 Do pull ups.
02:08:12.26 --> 02:08:13.26 Do pull ups.
02:08:13.26 --> 02:08:14.26 Now this is interesting.
02:08:14.26 --> 02:08:18.54 Speaking of reading and or speaking of writing, now we get into reading a little bit
02:08:18.54 --> 02:08:20.10 here.
02:08:20.10 --> 02:08:22.50 This is good.
02:08:22.50 --> 02:08:26.90 It is a good habit to underscore passages and books which have contributed something
02:08:26.90 --> 02:08:29.58 vital to one's own thought.
02:08:29.58 --> 02:08:32.42 Break out the high lighters.
02:08:32.42 --> 02:08:37.74 I kind of laughed when I read that because I have a lot of high lighters.
02:08:37.74 --> 02:08:40.50 I think you went winchester on a couple of days.
02:08:40.50 --> 02:08:44.30 Yeah, that's right.
02:08:44.30 --> 02:08:47.98 Now this is talking about going back to writing again as a practical matter is better to concentrate
02:08:47.98 --> 02:08:53.30 on a few elementary rules of thumb, such as our contained in the following list, then
02:08:53.30 --> 02:09:00.18 to bog down attempting to heed everything that the pendants have said about how to become a writer.
02:09:00.18 --> 02:09:05.06 So here's some advice on writing and you'll notice that these are good advice on life.
02:09:05.06 --> 02:09:10.98 The more simply a thing is said, the more powerfully it influences those who read.
02:09:10.98 --> 02:09:14.34 Plain words make strong writing.
02:09:14.34 --> 02:09:19.54 There is always one best word to convey a thought or a feeling, to accept the weaker
02:09:19.54 --> 02:09:27.26 substitute rather than to search for the right word will deprive any writing of force.
02:09:27.26 --> 02:09:32.78 Economy of words in the great composition.
02:09:32.78 --> 02:09:38.02 In all writing but in military writing particularly, there is no excuse for vague terminology
02:09:38.02 --> 02:09:44.62 or phrases which do not convey an exact expression of what was done or what is intended.
02:09:44.62 --> 02:09:49.70 And just think about how you communicate with your subordinates and think about these rules.
02:09:49.70 --> 02:09:52.98 So impactful.
02:09:52.98 --> 02:09:53.98 This is a good one.
02:09:53.98 --> 02:09:57.70 It is better at all times to reign in.
02:09:57.70 --> 02:10:02.42 The strength of military writing like the soundness of military operations does not gain
02:10:02.42 --> 02:10:06.26 through overstatement and artificial coloring.
02:10:06.26 --> 02:10:12.14 The bigger the subject, the less it needs in pro-eatery.
02:10:12.14 --> 02:10:19.42 Now, it's going to start talking here, go from talking about writing to talk about speaking.
02:10:19.42 --> 02:10:24.86 A majority of the world's most gifted writers would in all probability be dumbstruck
02:10:24.86 --> 02:10:27.66 if put before an audience.
02:10:27.66 --> 02:10:34.06 Though dealing confidently with ideas, they lack the confidence when dealing with people.
02:10:34.06 --> 02:10:40.30 The military officer has need of both talents and as to where the accent should be placed
02:10:40.30 --> 02:10:46.58 to this probably more important that he should speak well than his writing prose should
02:10:46.58 --> 02:10:49.86 be polished.
02:10:49.86 --> 02:10:54.50 A unit commander may permit a clerk or a subordinate to do the greater part of his paperwork,
02:10:54.50 --> 02:10:58.82 either because his own time is taken with other duties or because he is awkward at it.
02:10:58.82 --> 02:11:04.02 But if he permits any other voice to dominate the councils of the organization, he soon
02:11:04.02 --> 02:11:09.10 ceases to exercise moral authority over it.
02:11:09.10 --> 02:11:12.78 So you gotta be confident in your speaking.
02:11:12.78 --> 02:11:16.70 A little bit more important than the writing because you can have your guys do some writing.
02:11:16.70 --> 02:11:17.70 Yeah, I'll sign it.
02:11:17.70 --> 02:11:19.70 Looks good to me.
02:11:19.70 --> 02:11:24.38 This guy, one of the bosses I had.
02:11:24.38 --> 02:11:29.54 So he'd always misuse words, almost to the point where you know how some comedians will
02:11:29.54 --> 02:11:30.94 do that, like he'll misuse.
02:11:30.94 --> 02:11:35.46 He notch does that a lot of time, but this guy would for real do it.
02:11:35.46 --> 02:11:41.34 But you know what it was, is you know how the guy who's, they want to try to sound smart
02:11:41.34 --> 02:11:44.70 basically and got a good idea.
02:11:44.70 --> 02:11:48.02 Like, so he would use the word like irregardless.
02:11:48.02 --> 02:11:50.82 He would say irregardless, this is a supposed to regardless.
02:11:50.82 --> 02:11:55.42 And then there's another one that it's so funny because it was so counterproductive because
02:11:55.42 --> 02:11:58.78 when he would talk and we'd all be holding in our laughter and I'd work with this other
02:11:58.78 --> 02:11:59.78 guy.
02:11:59.78 --> 02:12:03.38 He was a kind of relentless jokes, you know, when you're gone.
02:12:03.38 --> 02:12:07.94 So if you did something and in this case you'd misuse words or when he leaves brother jokes
02:12:07.94 --> 02:12:09.46 would come and it'd be just so funny.
02:12:09.46 --> 02:12:13.18 But nonetheless he would use behoof, you know, behoof.
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:14.18 It would behoof.
02:12:14.18 --> 02:12:15.54 Yeah, here's a behoof.
02:12:15.54 --> 02:12:20.18 I think it is behoof, but you're right, because that's what I thought anyway, that's
02:12:20.18 --> 02:12:21.18 a whole lot of thing.
02:12:21.18 --> 02:12:22.82 But anyway, behoof then.
02:12:22.82 --> 02:12:24.58 So he would misuse that word.
02:12:24.58 --> 02:12:29.34 He would, he thought it meant what, he thought it meant baffling.
02:12:29.34 --> 02:12:33.26 Like, you know what really behoves me is that they do it this way.
02:12:33.26 --> 02:12:35.78 And then he keep doing it, you know.
02:12:35.78 --> 02:12:41.10 And so anyway, the point there is where you kind of, you got to know how to talk, right?
02:12:41.10 --> 02:12:46.82 So, and in this case, this was, this wasn't like some high levels like speeches he was
02:12:46.82 --> 02:12:48.62 making or addressed the game.
02:12:48.62 --> 02:12:50.78 It was just like normal stuff.
02:12:50.78 --> 02:12:56.74 So right, I thought that that was kind of critical in the way we regarded him as a part.
02:12:56.74 --> 02:13:01.78 That was one of the major things where we can't even take this guy seriously.
02:13:01.78 --> 02:13:04.02 Yeah, because he be hoofs me with everything.
02:13:04.02 --> 02:13:06.02 He was really be hoofing.
02:13:06.02 --> 02:13:09.02 He was like, oh, you're wrong usage.
02:13:09.02 --> 02:13:10.02 It's okay, people.
02:13:10.02 --> 02:13:11.02 Yeah, it's not okay.
02:13:11.02 --> 02:13:17.30 I guess the point there, a Nora separate point is learn the words, be free, start trying
02:13:17.30 --> 02:13:19.54 to throw them out, I guess.
02:13:19.54 --> 02:13:20.70 And that goes, that would be your scene.
02:13:20.70 --> 02:13:25.86 That would be very, yeah, that would be who, what you're saying about, it's better to
02:13:25.86 --> 02:13:32.18 seek the knowledge and be embarrassed because you got to seek to rather than get it called
02:13:32.18 --> 02:13:34.18 out when you don't know it or whatever.
02:13:34.18 --> 02:13:38.82 Anyway, the opportunity was to.
02:13:38.82 --> 02:13:45.26 Back to the book, the matter of nerve is a main element in speaking.
02:13:45.26 --> 02:13:49.86 When an officer is ill at ease, fidgety and not to the point, the vote of his command for
02:13:49.86 --> 02:13:53.26 the time being is no confidence.
02:13:53.26 --> 02:13:56.98 And so long as he remains that way, they will not change.
02:13:56.98 --> 02:14:02.18 No matter though, his good will shines for through another acts.
02:14:02.18 --> 02:14:06.62 So that's what you just said, if someone's jacked up when they're trying to talk to you
02:14:06.62 --> 02:14:09.18 and talk to the group, your vote is no confidence.
02:14:09.18 --> 02:14:13.02 Yeah, that's a constant vote.
02:14:13.02 --> 02:14:17.58 As for this is a good, back to the book.
02:14:17.58 --> 02:14:23.10 As for how an officer should talk to his men, his manner in tone should be no different
02:14:23.10 --> 02:14:27.82 than if he were addressing his fellow officers or for that matter, a group of the intellectual
02:14:27.82 --> 02:14:31.42 and political peers from any walk of life.
02:14:31.42 --> 02:14:34.22 If he is stuffy, he will not succeed.
02:14:34.22 --> 02:14:40.62 If he affects a superior manner, that is a mark of his inferiority.
02:14:40.62 --> 02:14:46.70 If he is patronizing and talks to grown men as a teacher might talk to a class of adolescence,
02:14:46.70 --> 02:14:52.58 the rug figuratively will be pulled out from under him.
02:14:52.58 --> 02:14:56.58 His audience will put down what put him down as a chump.
02:14:56.58 --> 02:15:00.94 It is curiously the case that the junior officer who can't get the right pitch when he
02:15:00.94 --> 02:15:06.50 talks to the ranks will also be out of tune when he talks to his superiors.
02:15:06.50 --> 02:15:13.18 This failing is a sign mainly that he needs practice in the school of human nature.
02:15:13.18 --> 02:15:22.74 I listening a little more carefully to other men, he may find himself in time, attain maturity.
02:15:22.74 --> 02:15:26.94 Another good way to get better at speaking is by listening.
02:15:26.94 --> 02:15:31.50 No doubt.
02:15:31.50 --> 02:15:36.94 When you're speaking sometimes you're instructing in one of the pieces here is called the
02:15:36.94 --> 02:15:41.94 Art of Instruction because you spend so much time when you're in a leadership position.
02:15:41.94 --> 02:15:44.82 You're instructing people whether you realize you're instructing people.
02:15:44.82 --> 02:15:46.46 Here's the rules that they say to follow.
02:15:46.46 --> 02:15:47.86 Keep it simple.
02:15:47.86 --> 02:15:54.14 Have one main object, stay on the course, remain cheerful, be enthusiastic, put it out
02:15:54.14 --> 02:16:02.46 as if the ideas were as interesting and novel to you as to your audience.
02:16:02.46 --> 02:16:06.02 This is a story which really doesn't know what has to do with instruction, but it's
02:16:06.02 --> 02:16:10.34 cool stories from the reading anyways because it's just badass.
02:16:10.34 --> 02:16:15.26 In World War I, the American major, named now long forgotten was given the task of making
02:16:15.26 --> 02:16:21.94 the rounds and talking to all combat formations and convincing them that the future was bright.
02:16:21.94 --> 02:16:22.94 No boy scout Aaron.
02:16:22.94 --> 02:16:24.98 So you imagine your world war one.
02:16:24.98 --> 02:16:26.98 We've talked about that.
02:16:26.98 --> 02:16:32.66 It's a nightmare in his job as to go around and ensure people that the future is bright.
02:16:32.66 --> 02:16:36.78 But wherever he went, morale was lifted by his words.
02:16:36.78 --> 02:16:41.58 And substance, in substance, what he said was this.
02:16:41.58 --> 02:16:46.54 None of us cares about making a living with any individuals who wants every break his own
02:16:46.54 --> 02:16:47.54 way.
02:16:47.54 --> 02:16:52.78 But when the odds are even, the gamble is worth any good man's time.
02:16:52.78 --> 02:16:55.46 So let's look at the proportion.
02:16:55.46 --> 02:16:58.42 You now have one chance and two.
02:16:58.42 --> 02:17:01.02 You may go overseas or you may not.
02:17:01.02 --> 02:17:02.34 Suppose you do.
02:17:02.34 --> 02:17:03.94 You still have one chance and two.
02:17:03.94 --> 02:17:06.42 You may go to the front or you may not.
02:17:06.42 --> 02:17:09.86 If you don't, you'll see a foreign country at Uncle Sam's expense.
02:17:09.86 --> 02:17:16.50 If you do, you'll find out about war, which is the toughest chance of them all.
02:17:16.50 --> 02:17:21.10 But up there, on the front, you still have one chance and two.
02:17:21.10 --> 02:17:24.26 You may get hit or you may not.
02:17:24.26 --> 02:17:29.86 If you breeze through it, you'll be a better man for all the rest of your life.
02:17:29.86 --> 02:17:34.66 And if you get hit, you still have one chance and two.
02:17:34.66 --> 02:17:41.02 You may get a small wound and become a hero to your friends and family.
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:46.26 Or there is always the last chance that it may take you out all together.
02:17:46.26 --> 02:17:52.30 And while that is a little rugged, it is at least worth remembering that very few people
02:17:52.30 --> 02:17:56.74 seem to get out of this life alive.
02:17:56.74 --> 02:17:58.62 Classic.
02:17:58.62 --> 02:18:02.10 Classic.
02:18:02.10 --> 02:18:10.02 Now talking about reading Napoleon once said that the point that a trouble with books
02:18:10.02 --> 02:18:14.58 is that one must read so many bad ones to find something really good.
02:18:14.58 --> 02:18:15.58 True enough.
02:18:15.58 --> 02:18:20.46 But even so, there are perfectly practical ways to advance rapidly without undue-waste
02:18:20.46 --> 02:18:21.86 emotion.
02:18:21.86 --> 02:18:25.46 Consider this, among one's superiors, there are always discriminating men who have
02:18:25.46 --> 02:18:30.42 adopted a few good books after reading many, many bad ones.
02:18:30.42 --> 02:18:37.02 And they say that a text is worthwhile, it deserves reading and careful study.
02:18:37.02 --> 02:18:41.38 So, what books did somebody you respect read?
02:18:41.38 --> 02:18:43.14 They said it's good book, read it.
02:18:43.14 --> 02:18:52.30 Now you gotta be careful because the well-read man need not have more than a dozen books
02:18:52.30 --> 02:18:55.42 in his home provided that they all count with him.
02:18:55.42 --> 02:18:59.78 And he continues to pull over them and ponder the weight of what is said.
02:18:59.78 --> 02:19:05.98 On the other hand, the ignorant man is frequently marked by his bookshelf stocked with titles
02:19:05.98 --> 02:19:11.46 not one of which suggests that he has any professional discernment.
02:19:11.46 --> 02:19:17.06 Now I can tell you right now, I'm building a library of books that's kind of crazy
02:19:17.06 --> 02:19:23.50 because every time somebody hits me up on social media and says, hey, you gotta shout
02:19:23.50 --> 02:19:24.50 this book.
02:19:24.50 --> 02:19:27.66 I used to go on Amazon and kind of look at read reviews now.
02:19:27.66 --> 02:19:28.66 I just wore a grit.
02:19:28.66 --> 02:19:33.62 I mean, basically order it because I don't have time and it's hard to tell from the reviews
02:19:33.62 --> 02:19:34.94 and it takes much time.
02:19:34.94 --> 02:19:37.22 It's easier just to push click by now.
02:19:37.22 --> 02:19:38.22 Yeah.
02:19:38.22 --> 02:19:41.34 Amazon, I'm clicking through the Jockel Podcast Store website.
02:19:41.34 --> 02:19:45.22 So we're giving back to the podcast.
02:19:45.22 --> 02:19:49.18 But the thing is, a lot of people might think this book is great.
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:53.86 All this to be a great book, but it doesn't quite work.
02:19:53.86 --> 02:19:57.70 So I'm probably getting, I'd say one out of every five books that I ordered to
02:19:57.70 --> 02:20:00.46 say, yeah, this one's this one's game.
02:20:00.46 --> 02:20:01.46 Yeah.
02:20:01.46 --> 02:20:06.90 What he's saying there about the difference between somebody who was a huge stock
02:20:06.90 --> 02:20:11.78 of books is he's saying like a variety of different books that doesn't, it's
02:20:11.78 --> 02:20:14.62 something but not indicating any kind of expertise or something.
02:20:14.62 --> 02:20:17.86 It just says he just shows that he doesn't have any discernment.
02:20:17.86 --> 02:20:19.26 This guy just buying a bunch of books.
02:20:19.26 --> 02:20:20.54 He might not know anything about him.
02:20:20.54 --> 02:20:23.26 It doesn't mean it don't touch a book by its cover.
02:20:23.26 --> 02:20:24.26 Pond intended.
02:20:24.26 --> 02:20:25.78 You know, just because this guy's got a bunch of books.
02:20:25.78 --> 02:20:30.30 It doesn't mean that he's read them all doesn't mean that he actually, they're all
02:20:30.30 --> 02:20:31.30 great books.
02:20:31.30 --> 02:20:32.30 Really?
02:20:32.30 --> 02:20:34.34 I can tell you right now, they're not long-grain books in the world.
02:20:34.34 --> 02:20:35.34 Yeah.
02:20:35.34 --> 02:20:36.34 A lot of books are not good.
02:20:36.34 --> 02:20:38.42 And you shouldn't waste your time reading them.
02:20:38.42 --> 02:20:42.62 But if you walked into a guy that was smart that you were speculated 12 books, I would
02:20:42.62 --> 02:20:44.30 just write them all down and go buy them all.
02:20:44.30 --> 02:20:45.30 Yeah.
02:20:45.30 --> 02:20:47.06 And you're probably going to be 10 for 12 for 12.
02:20:47.06 --> 02:20:48.06 Yeah.
02:20:48.06 --> 02:20:49.22 Or at least 10 for 12.
02:20:49.22 --> 02:20:54.30 Whereas if I go into your room and you've got 570 books in there, yeah.
02:20:54.30 --> 02:20:56.06 These are all great books.
02:20:56.06 --> 02:20:57.26 There's something wrong with your discernment.
02:20:57.26 --> 02:20:59.06 You don't know what a good book is.
02:20:59.06 --> 02:21:00.06 Yeah.
02:21:00.06 --> 02:21:01.54 So get some discernment.
02:21:01.54 --> 02:21:03.54 Or I'm just trying to make like I read so much.
02:21:03.54 --> 02:21:09.26 You're going to make 570 books.
02:21:09.26 --> 02:21:15.30 This section, your relationships with your men.
02:21:15.30 --> 02:21:16.30 And I had to break.
02:21:16.30 --> 02:21:17.50 I had to say this part.
02:21:17.50 --> 02:21:22.22 And officers not expected to appear all wise to those who serve under him.
02:21:22.22 --> 02:21:24.98 So often guys feel that pressure that they think they should know everything.
02:21:24.98 --> 02:21:25.98 Yeah.
02:21:25.98 --> 02:21:26.98 Oh my gosh.
02:21:26.98 --> 02:21:27.98 I don't know if I admit that.
02:21:27.98 --> 02:21:28.98 I don't know this.
02:21:28.98 --> 02:21:29.98 I'm going to look bad.
02:21:29.98 --> 02:21:34.46 Bluffing ones away through a question when ignorant of the answer is full-hardy business.
02:21:34.46 --> 02:21:35.66 I'm sorry, but I don't know.
02:21:35.66 --> 02:21:39.06 It's just as appropriate from an officer's lips is from any other.
02:21:39.06 --> 02:21:44.22 And it helps a little more to add, but I'll find out.
02:21:44.22 --> 02:21:47.46 Rank should be used to serve one's subordinates.
02:21:47.46 --> 02:21:51.82 It should never be flaunted or used to get the upper hand of a subordinate any situation
02:21:51.82 --> 02:21:59.42 safe where he has already discredited himself in an unusually ugly or unseemingly manner.
02:21:59.42 --> 02:22:03.46 When suggestions from any subordinate are adopted, the credits should be passed on to him
02:22:03.46 --> 02:22:05.10 publicly.
02:22:05.10 --> 02:22:10.14 When a subordinate is made a mistake, but not from any lack of good will, it is common
02:22:10.14 --> 02:22:15.90 sense to take the rap for him rather than make him suffer doubly for his error.
02:22:15.90 --> 02:22:20.18 An officer should not issue orders which he cannot enforce.
02:22:20.18 --> 02:22:25.82 He should be as good as his word at all times and in any circumstance.
02:22:25.82 --> 02:22:29.18 He should promise nothing which he cannot make stick.
02:22:29.18 --> 02:22:33.82 An officer should not work looking over his men's shoulders, checking on every detail of what
02:22:33.82 --> 02:22:40.02 they're doing and calling them to account at every furlong past.
02:22:40.02 --> 02:22:46.54 This made and lead attitude corrode confidence and destroys initiatives so don't micromanage.
02:22:46.54 --> 02:22:52.34 On the other hand, contact is necessary at all times, particularly when men are doing long-term
02:22:52.34 --> 02:22:55.78 work or operating in a detachment at a remote point.
02:22:55.78 --> 02:22:59.38 They will become discouraged and will lose their sense of direction unless their superior
02:22:59.38 --> 02:23:02.22 looks in on them periodically.
02:23:02.22 --> 02:23:08.14 Ask them whether he can be of any help and so doing gets them to open up the discussion
02:23:08.14 --> 02:23:11.26 and the problem.
02:23:11.26 --> 02:23:16.06 The Navy says this is another good one right here.
02:23:16.06 --> 02:23:21.78 The Navy says it isn't courtesy to change the set of the sale within 30 minutes after
02:23:21.78 --> 02:23:23.78 the relief of watch.
02:23:23.78 --> 02:23:28.50 Applied to command job this means that it is a mistake for an officer on taking a new
02:23:28.50 --> 02:23:32.38 post to order sweeping changes affecting the other men.
02:23:32.38 --> 02:23:37.14 In the belief that this will give a reputation for action and firmness.
02:23:37.14 --> 02:23:43.46 The studying of the situation is the overture of the setting of it.
02:23:43.46 --> 02:23:49.18 The story is told of Curtis E. Lamay of the Air Force taking over the 21st bomber
02:23:49.18 --> 02:23:51.46 command and the Mariana's.
02:23:51.46 --> 02:23:57.42 He faced the worried staff officers of his predecessor and said quietly, you're all
02:23:57.42 --> 02:23:58.42 staying put.
02:23:58.42 --> 02:24:03.62 I assume you know your jobs or you wouldn't be here.
02:24:03.62 --> 02:24:04.62 Pretty simple.
02:24:04.62 --> 02:24:06.62 Then people always ask, come into a new year.
02:24:06.62 --> 02:24:08.18 What do I do when I take over?
02:24:08.18 --> 02:24:09.18 Relax.
02:24:09.18 --> 02:24:10.18 Be humble.
02:24:10.18 --> 02:24:11.18 Listen.
02:24:11.18 --> 02:24:12.18 Observe.
02:24:12.18 --> 02:24:13.18 Don't need to jump in there and change the set of the sale.
02:24:13.18 --> 02:24:14.18 All right, echo's gone now.
02:24:14.18 --> 02:24:15.18 I'm in charge.
02:24:15.18 --> 02:24:16.18 Change everything.
02:24:16.18 --> 02:24:20.22 No, wrong answer.
02:24:20.22 --> 02:24:25.06 This next section, your men's moral and physical welfare.
02:24:25.06 --> 02:24:30.10 When men are moral, the moral power which binds them together and fits them for high
02:24:30.10 --> 02:24:37.18 action is given its main chance for success.
02:24:37.18 --> 02:24:40.02 Now listen to these.
02:24:40.02 --> 02:24:45.74 To be temperate and all things, to be content and refrain from loose living of any sort
02:24:45.74 --> 02:24:48.26 are acts of the will.
02:24:48.26 --> 02:24:54.58 They require self-denial and are forgoing of that which may be more attractive in favor
02:24:54.58 --> 02:24:58.58 of the thing which should be done.
02:24:58.58 --> 02:25:02.18 Granted there are few individuals who are so thin blooded that they never feel tempted to
02:25:02.18 --> 02:25:05.18 digress morally.
02:25:05.18 --> 02:25:07.18 Men in the majority are not like that.
02:25:07.18 --> 02:25:09.30 So there's some guys that just on the straight narrow.
02:25:09.30 --> 02:25:14.58 They're so thin blooded that they just get no temptations.
02:25:14.58 --> 02:25:16.94 Most men, they get temptations.
02:25:16.94 --> 02:25:22.78 What they were now in the name of self-discipline at the cost of a considerably and considerable
02:25:22.78 --> 02:25:28.98 interest, they endeavored to compensate by gains in their personal character.
02:25:28.98 --> 02:25:36.98 Making that grade isn't easy, but no one who is anyone has yet said that it isn't worthwhile.
02:25:36.98 --> 02:25:41.50 In the armed services they're an old saying that an officer without character is more useless
02:25:41.50 --> 02:25:44.34 than a ship with no bottom.
02:25:44.34 --> 02:25:51.10 In summing up the strength of will, which enables a man to lead a clean life is no different
02:25:51.10 --> 02:25:57.86 than the strength of purpose which fits him to follow a hard line of duty.
02:25:57.86 --> 02:25:59.54 There are exceptions to every rule.
02:25:59.54 --> 02:26:05.06 Many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.
02:26:05.06 --> 02:26:11.06 But even though he had an uncorcoable weakness for drinking women, his resolution had
02:26:11.06 --> 02:26:18.74 to become steeled along some other line or he would have been no good when the payoff came.
02:26:18.74 --> 02:26:24.90 So this is saying that the strength of will that it takes to stay strong in all these
02:26:24.90 --> 02:26:31.98 situations, all these temptations that will is real and that can transfer over.
02:26:31.98 --> 02:26:38.46 Now I can tell you that this one is there's all the militaries filled.
02:26:38.46 --> 02:26:42.22 He says many a lovable rounder has proved himself to be a first class fighting man.
02:26:42.22 --> 02:26:48.50 Of course, guys, they're bad ass guys throughout the ages that were even Henry the
02:26:48.50 --> 02:26:51.02 fifth out of wild man reputation.
02:26:51.02 --> 02:26:56.50 Going back to Shakespeare.
02:26:56.50 --> 02:27:04.74 So, but he's saying that these staying on the straight narrow enforces your will is what
02:27:04.74 --> 02:27:05.74 he's saying.
02:27:05.74 --> 02:27:09.66 Back to the book, putting aside for the moment the question of the vices and regarding
02:27:09.66 --> 02:27:15.10 only the gain to moral power, which comes of bodily exercise and physical condition.
02:27:15.10 --> 02:27:18.58 So he's talked about vices, okay, we got it.
02:27:18.58 --> 02:27:20.58 Stay clean.
02:27:20.58 --> 02:27:21.94 Stay clean is what he's saying.
02:27:21.94 --> 02:27:27.74 But now he's saying there's something else or something called exercise and physical conditioning.
02:27:27.74 --> 02:27:31.94 It should be self-evident that the process which builds the muscle must also train and
02:27:31.94 --> 02:27:33.54 alert the mind.
02:27:33.54 --> 02:27:36.02 How could it be otherwise?
02:27:36.02 --> 02:27:43.46 Every physical act must have as its origin, a mental impulse, conscious or unconscious.
02:27:43.46 --> 02:27:50.66 Thus, in training a man to master his muscles, we also help him to master his brain.
02:27:50.66 --> 02:27:56.02 He comes out of physical training not only better condition to move, but better prepared
02:27:56.02 --> 02:28:02.90 to think about how and why he is moving, which is true mobility.
02:28:02.90 --> 02:28:04.90 So you want to strengthen your will?
02:28:04.90 --> 02:28:05.90 Yes.
02:28:05.90 --> 02:28:06.90 Stay clean.
02:28:06.90 --> 02:28:12.10 Stay on the moral path and then get your physical conditioning on because that's going
02:28:12.10 --> 02:28:15.94 to make you mentally tougher.
02:28:15.94 --> 02:28:19.50 Back to the book in the United States service, we are tending to forget because of the
02:28:19.50 --> 02:28:26.14 effective motorization that the higher value of the discipline of the road march in other
02:28:26.14 --> 02:28:30.10 days wasn't that it hardened the muscles.
02:28:30.10 --> 02:28:37.58 But that short of combat, it was the best method of separating the men from the boys.
02:28:37.58 --> 02:28:41.94 This is true today, despite all the new conditions imposed by technological changes.
02:28:41.94 --> 02:28:47.34 A hard road march is the most satisfactory training test of the moral strength of the
02:28:47.34 --> 02:28:50.18 individual man.
02:28:50.18 --> 02:28:55.62 At the same time, to sensibly overload men, for road marching hurts them in two ways.
02:28:55.62 --> 02:28:58.26 So there's a dichotomy to everything.
02:28:58.26 --> 02:29:00.58 So you can hurt them with the road march.
02:29:00.58 --> 02:29:01.58 Here's the two ways.
02:29:01.58 --> 02:29:07.62 It weakens their faith in the sense of the command, thereby impairing morale, and it breaks
02:29:07.62 --> 02:29:09.38 down their muscle and tendon.
02:29:09.38 --> 02:29:11.58 So you overload them, you're going to crush them, you're going to break them, and you're
02:29:11.58 --> 02:29:14.14 going to ruin their spirit.
02:29:14.14 --> 02:29:18.30 There is another not infrequent cause of breakdown.
02:29:18.30 --> 02:29:23.38 The leader who makes the mistake of thinking that every man's limit is the same as his
02:29:23.38 --> 02:29:26.22 own.
02:29:26.22 --> 02:29:29.50 So you, oh, I can do this.
02:29:29.50 --> 02:29:32.06 I can dump in 20 miles or 20 clicks.
02:29:32.06 --> 02:29:35.14 Everyone can do it, wrong answer.
02:29:35.14 --> 02:29:39.90 When an officer does this kind of thing thoughtlessly, he shows himself to be an incompetent
02:29:39.90 --> 02:29:41.90 observer of men.
02:29:41.90 --> 02:29:47.14 He does it to show off he deserves to be given 10 days in the electric chair.
02:29:47.14 --> 02:29:49.42 Hey, there you go.
02:29:49.42 --> 02:29:51.14 Get me electric chair, 10 days.
02:29:51.14 --> 02:29:54.18 That's like how many times do you die in 10 days in the electric chair?
02:29:54.18 --> 02:29:55.34 No, a lot.
02:29:55.34 --> 02:29:56.34 But don't show off.
02:29:56.34 --> 02:29:57.34 It's the point.
02:29:57.34 --> 02:29:58.34 Yeah.
02:29:58.34 --> 02:30:00.46 Otherwise you're going in the electric chair for 10 days.
02:30:00.46 --> 02:30:05.42 But isn't that like an old classic thing in the movie where it's usually to combat
02:30:05.42 --> 02:30:07.66 like a situation where the guys are complaining.
02:30:07.66 --> 02:30:09.74 You know, all of this is unrealistic.
02:30:09.74 --> 02:30:12.02 I don't know, obstacle course.
02:30:12.02 --> 02:30:13.02 Yeah.
02:30:13.02 --> 02:30:15.86 And then the drill sergeant or whoever.
02:30:15.86 --> 02:30:16.86 He does it.
02:30:16.86 --> 02:30:18.30 You know, he's like the older guy.
02:30:18.30 --> 02:30:19.70 Well, yeah, he's proving that look.
02:30:19.70 --> 02:30:21.82 I'm not asking you do anything that I wouldn't do myself.
02:30:21.82 --> 02:30:22.82 Yeah.
02:30:22.82 --> 02:30:23.82 That's all that that is.
02:30:23.82 --> 02:30:24.82 Right.
02:30:24.82 --> 02:30:27.62 But in a way, he's like, hey, I can do it.
02:30:27.62 --> 02:30:28.98 So you should be able to do it.
02:30:28.98 --> 02:30:29.98 That's true.
02:30:29.98 --> 02:30:30.98 Guess what?
02:30:30.98 --> 02:30:33.34 A young recruit should be able to do it.
02:30:33.34 --> 02:30:35.46 Oh, what's it?
02:30:35.46 --> 02:30:36.78 Otherwise you're not reaching the standards.
02:30:36.78 --> 02:30:38.18 We've got to have standards.
02:30:38.18 --> 02:30:39.18 Yeah.
02:30:39.18 --> 02:30:43.30 But if you were saying, hey, you should be able to do this with one on a time behind
02:30:43.30 --> 02:30:44.30 your back like I can.
02:30:44.30 --> 02:30:45.30 Could have been a big wrong.
02:30:45.30 --> 02:30:46.30 Yeah.
02:30:46.30 --> 02:30:47.30 You see the difference, sir?
02:30:47.30 --> 02:30:48.30 Oh, yeah.
02:30:48.30 --> 02:30:49.30 Because I make sure, because otherwise you can get me on the tech
02:30:49.30 --> 02:30:50.30 Picallity.
02:30:50.30 --> 02:30:52.50 Don't want that to happen over here.
02:30:52.50 --> 02:30:57.74 Speaking of athletic accomplishments in the nature of things, the officer who's
02:30:57.74 --> 02:31:02.74 been an athlete can fit himself into this part of the program with little difficulty and with
02:31:02.74 --> 02:31:07.54 great credit provided he acts with moderation that it here is suggested.
02:31:07.54 --> 02:31:11.50 By the same token, the officer who has shunned sports in school either because he didn't
02:31:11.50 --> 02:31:15.34 have the size or coordination or it's more interested in something else will frequently
02:31:15.34 --> 02:31:20.34 have an understandable hesitation about trying to play the lead hand in anything which
02:31:20.34 --> 02:31:22.34 he thinks will make him look bad.
02:31:22.34 --> 02:31:28.50 Just talking about the benefits of the sports.
02:31:28.50 --> 02:31:34.22 If he has not kept himself in good physical shape, his nerves will not be able to stand
02:31:34.22 --> 02:31:39.10 the strain of combat to say nothing of his legs.
02:31:39.10 --> 02:31:43.42 It can be said again and again, the highest form of physical training that an officer
02:31:43.42 --> 02:31:47.74 can undergo is the physical conditioning of his own men.
02:31:47.74 --> 02:31:51.98 Nothing else can give him more faith in his own ability to stay the course and nothing
02:31:51.98 --> 02:31:57.02 else is likely to give him a firm or feeling of solidarity with his men.
02:31:57.02 --> 02:32:01.78 Study and an active thirst for wider professional knowledge have their place in an officer's
02:32:01.78 --> 02:32:07.70 scheme of things but there is something about the experience of bodily competition of
02:32:07.70 --> 02:32:13.58 joining with and leading men in strunuous physical exercise which uniquely invigorates
02:32:13.58 --> 02:32:17.02 one spirit with the confidence I can do this.
02:32:17.02 --> 02:32:18.18 I can lead.
02:32:18.18 --> 02:32:22.94 I can command.
02:32:22.94 --> 02:32:26.22 The body and minor connected everybody.
02:32:26.22 --> 02:32:29.30 No it.
02:32:29.30 --> 02:32:33.62 Back to the book, the really good thing about the gain and moral force deriving from
02:32:33.62 --> 02:32:39.18 all forms of physical training is that it is an unconscious gain.
02:32:39.18 --> 02:32:45.54 Willpower, determination, mental poise and muscle control all march hand in hand with
02:32:45.54 --> 02:32:48.50 the general health and well-being of the man.
02:32:48.50 --> 02:32:54.62 With results not less decisive under training conditions than on the field of battle.
02:32:54.62 --> 02:32:58.86 A man who develops correct posture and begins to fill out his body so that he looks
02:32:58.86 --> 02:33:03.38 the part of a fighter will take greater pride in wearing of the uniform.
02:33:03.38 --> 02:33:09.50 In doing so, he will take greater care to conduct himself morally that he will not disgrace
02:33:09.50 --> 02:33:10.50 it.
02:33:10.50 --> 02:33:16.90 He will gain confidence as he acquires a confident and determined bearing.
02:33:16.90 --> 02:33:21.70 The same presence and the physical strength which contributes to it will help carry him
02:33:21.70 --> 02:33:24.98 through the hour of danger.
02:33:24.98 --> 02:33:30.50 The strength of will is partly of the mind and partly of the body.
02:33:30.50 --> 02:33:38.70 In combat fatigue will be down men as quickly as any other condition for fatigue inevitably
02:33:38.70 --> 02:33:41.78 carries fear with it.
02:33:41.78 --> 02:33:45.22 Tired men are afraid.
02:33:45.22 --> 02:33:49.50 There is no quicker way to lose a battle than to lose it on the road for lack of preliminary
02:33:49.50 --> 02:33:56.18 hardening intrups such a condition cannot be redeemed by the resolve of a commander who insists
02:33:56.18 --> 02:34:01.82 on driving troops and extra mile beyond their general level of physical endurance.
02:34:01.82 --> 02:34:05.34 So if you got guys that aren't ready, just because you're fired up doesn't mean it's
02:34:05.34 --> 02:34:06.34 going to work.
02:34:06.34 --> 02:34:07.62 You can't push them hard now.
02:34:07.62 --> 02:34:08.62 Here's what happens.
02:34:08.62 --> 02:34:13.66 Extremes of this sort make men rebellious and hateful of the command and thus strike
02:34:13.66 --> 02:34:20.66 a tactical efficiency from two directions at once for when men resent a commander they will
02:34:20.66 --> 02:34:30.70 not fight as willingly for him and when their bodies are spent, their nerves are gone.
02:34:30.70 --> 02:34:33.42 Physical conditioning.
02:34:33.42 --> 02:34:35.98 Now on top of that we got the physical conditioning.
02:34:35.98 --> 02:34:43.38 You also have to keep your people informed in war in the absence of information,
02:34:43.38 --> 02:34:50.06 natural promptings alternate between unresening fears that the worst is likely to happen
02:34:50.06 --> 02:34:54.78 and a wispful thought that all danger is remote.
02:34:54.78 --> 02:34:59.94 Either impulse is a barrier to the growth of that condition of alert confidence which
02:34:59.94 --> 02:35:05.26 comes to men when they have a realization of their own strength and a reasonably clear
02:35:05.26 --> 02:35:10.66 concept of the general situation.
02:35:10.66 --> 02:35:13.50 You've got to keep your people informed as well as talking about earlier being at the
02:35:13.50 --> 02:35:18.10 end of a poll tune.
02:35:18.10 --> 02:35:21.78 Next section is about counseling your men.
02:35:21.78 --> 02:35:26.62 Nothing more unfortunate can happen to an officer than to come to be regarded by his
02:35:26.62 --> 02:35:29.50 support and says unapproachable.
02:35:29.50 --> 02:35:35.66 For such a reputation itulates him from the main problems of the command, responsibility
02:35:35.66 --> 02:35:37.98 as well as its chief rewards.
02:35:37.98 --> 02:35:41.34 Now, how do you become approachable?
02:35:41.34 --> 02:35:47.10 The two formal manner, the overrigid attitude, the disposition to deal with any human
02:35:47.10 --> 02:35:52.74 problem by the numbers as if it were one more act in an organizational routine can have
02:35:52.74 --> 02:35:56.22 a chilling effect upon men.
02:35:56.22 --> 02:36:00.18 So that idea that you're just going to be by the book on everything that's not going
02:36:00.18 --> 02:36:03.34 to make you approachable.
02:36:03.34 --> 02:36:07.94 That being said, back to the book, it is not necessary that an officer wet nurse is
02:36:07.94 --> 02:36:11.90 men in order to serve well in the role of counsel.
02:36:11.90 --> 02:36:16.98 His door should be open, but he's not play the part either of father, confessor, or
02:36:16.98 --> 02:36:19.78 of a hotel greeter.
02:36:19.78 --> 02:36:24.54 Neither great solony or a fusedness are called for, but mainly serious attention to the
02:36:24.54 --> 02:36:28.14 problem and then straightforward advice or decision.
02:36:28.14 --> 02:36:32.66 According to the nature of the case and provided that from his own knowledge and experience,
02:36:32.66 --> 02:36:36.10 he feels qualified to give it.
02:36:36.10 --> 02:36:41.38 If not, it is wiser to defer than to offer a half-baked opinion.
02:36:41.38 --> 02:36:43.42 So that's okay if you don't know.
02:36:43.42 --> 02:36:44.42 Hey look, I don't know.
02:36:44.42 --> 02:36:46.06 I'm done with this before.
02:36:46.06 --> 02:36:50.26 Maybe you should go talk to Echo, he deals with these computers all the time, come
02:36:50.26 --> 02:36:55.54 to me with your computer problems.
02:36:55.54 --> 02:36:59.94 Back to the book, World War II officers had to abide by this standard dealing with
02:36:59.94 --> 02:37:05.06 the general malaise which rose out of redeployment.
02:37:05.06 --> 02:37:09.26 When a man came forward and said that he couldn't take it anymore and the commander knew
02:37:09.26 --> 02:37:14.46 that he'd always been a highly, doodiful individual, it became the commander's job to attempt
02:37:14.46 --> 02:37:16.34 to get the man home.
02:37:16.34 --> 02:37:21.66 But when a second man came forward with the same story and the record showed that he'd always
02:37:21.66 --> 02:37:26.70 shirked his work, the question was whether he should be given the final chance to shirk
02:37:26.70 --> 02:37:28.66 it again.
02:37:28.66 --> 02:37:32.58 The favor of the first man meant furthering discipline.
02:37:32.58 --> 02:37:36.34 His comrades recognized it as a fair deal.
02:37:36.34 --> 02:37:41.78 To turn back the second man was equally constructive to the same end.
02:37:41.78 --> 02:37:43.22 So those are just classic.
02:37:43.22 --> 02:37:45.42 We've seen that in just about every book we read.
02:37:45.42 --> 02:37:48.38 With some guy World War II, we saw a bunch of it.
02:37:48.38 --> 02:37:51.50 Some guy would just lose it and we even saw the Korean, some of the Korean books we've
02:37:51.50 --> 02:37:52.50 covered.
02:37:52.50 --> 02:37:53.50 The guy loses it.
02:37:53.50 --> 02:37:54.50 But they're a good guy.
02:37:54.50 --> 02:37:55.50 Remember the guy walked around and asleep in the back.
02:37:55.50 --> 02:37:57.70 Look, we're just going to take care of this guy.
02:37:57.70 --> 02:37:58.70 He's been a good guy.
02:37:58.70 --> 02:37:59.70 We'll get him off the front.
02:37:59.70 --> 02:38:01.02 He's got a few days left.
02:38:01.02 --> 02:38:06.42 But then when you get a guy that's weak and scared and doesn't man up and do his duty, and
02:38:06.42 --> 02:38:08.98 he wants to go home, they're not giving that guy the slack.
02:38:08.98 --> 02:38:14.86 Doesn't deserve it, didn't earn it.
02:38:14.86 --> 02:38:16.06 Now this is interesting.
02:38:16.06 --> 02:38:22.58 There are officers who hold every subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to advance
02:38:22.58 --> 02:38:24.06 their personal fortunes.
02:38:24.06 --> 02:38:27.02 So this is what we're talking about here is, and this happens a lot in the military.
02:38:27.02 --> 02:38:31.58 It happens in every business I work with where you got people that are being moved around.
02:38:31.58 --> 02:38:33.06 So like, oh, echo works.
02:38:33.06 --> 02:38:34.70 You got this guy Billy that works for you.
02:38:34.70 --> 02:38:36.82 Hey, I need Billy to help me with this project.
02:38:36.82 --> 02:38:37.82 What do you say?
02:38:37.82 --> 02:38:39.06 No, you can't have him.
02:38:39.06 --> 02:38:40.06 He's my guy.
02:38:40.06 --> 02:38:41.06 What are you working on right now?
02:38:41.06 --> 02:38:42.06 I got some projects coming up.
02:38:42.06 --> 02:38:43.06 I need him right now.
02:38:43.06 --> 02:38:44.06 Don't say I have a project.
02:38:44.06 --> 02:38:45.06 You know what I'm saying?
02:38:45.06 --> 02:38:49.10 Some people go into that mode where they hold everyone like a Grim Death.
02:38:49.10 --> 02:38:53.86 They're officers who hold every able subordinate like Grim Death, seeing no better way to
02:38:53.86 --> 02:38:56.22 advance their personal fortunes.
02:38:56.22 --> 02:39:03.18 This is a sign of moral weakness, not of strength, and it is inevitable fruit.
02:39:03.18 --> 02:39:07.58 And it's inevitable fruit is discontent within the organization.
02:39:07.58 --> 02:39:13.14 The sign of superiority in any officer at whatever level is his confidence that he can make
02:39:13.14 --> 02:39:18.94 another good man to fill any vacancy.
02:39:18.94 --> 02:39:21.54 The other time I don't like that is when somebody, you know, if you're going to give
02:39:21.54 --> 02:39:25.42 me Billy and it's actually a promotion for Billy, it's like a step up, but you don't
02:39:25.42 --> 02:39:26.42 want to give me any of these.
02:39:26.42 --> 02:39:29.86 You're hurting him because you're trying to help yourself.
02:39:29.86 --> 02:39:30.86 No, give the guy up.
02:39:30.86 --> 02:39:31.86 Find somebody else new.
02:39:31.86 --> 02:39:32.86 Find a better person.
02:39:32.86 --> 02:39:34.58 Find somebody who's going to mold and make better.
02:39:34.58 --> 02:39:36.86 Yeah, that happened to me before.
02:39:36.86 --> 02:39:38.86 Were you the guy?
02:39:38.86 --> 02:39:40.26 Were you the guy?
02:39:40.26 --> 02:39:42.26 The guy that got didn't get promoted?
02:39:42.26 --> 02:39:43.26 Correct.
02:39:43.26 --> 02:39:44.86 Somebody held onto you.
02:39:44.86 --> 02:39:51.42 Yeah, and it was less about if I did or didn't get promoted, it was that he was just
02:39:51.42 --> 02:39:52.42 holding on.
02:39:52.42 --> 02:39:55.62 Where, you know, took kind of negating any chance of that.
02:39:55.62 --> 02:39:56.62 It was clear.
02:39:56.62 --> 02:39:58.34 He actually even told me to.
02:39:58.34 --> 02:40:01.34 Well, that was at least straightforward of him.
02:40:01.34 --> 02:40:02.34 Yeah.
02:40:02.34 --> 02:40:03.34 Not good.
02:40:03.34 --> 02:40:07.70 How that work out for you for your morale?
02:40:07.70 --> 02:40:08.70 It didn't help.
02:40:08.70 --> 02:40:12.18 What are the other way?
02:40:12.18 --> 02:40:13.18 Back to the book.
02:40:13.18 --> 02:40:17.66 Some of the ableist commanders in our service have abided by this rule.
02:40:17.66 --> 02:40:21.66 They never denied the man who had a legitimate reason for transfer.
02:40:21.66 --> 02:40:28.90 And they never shuffled off their lemons and gold bricks under a false label.
02:40:28.90 --> 02:40:31.30 So that does another thing that happened in businesses.
02:40:31.30 --> 02:40:33.50 Hey, you got Billy, he'd Billy's a bum.
02:40:33.50 --> 02:40:36.26 And I say, hey, echo, I need a guy over here to help me with this.
02:40:36.26 --> 02:40:37.50 Oh, yeah, you can have Billy.
02:40:37.50 --> 02:40:38.50 Great guy.
02:40:38.50 --> 02:40:39.50 Yeah.
02:40:39.50 --> 02:40:40.50 You can be Billy, he's a disaster.
02:40:40.50 --> 02:40:41.90 That's a gold brick.
02:40:41.90 --> 02:40:45.90 It's a lie.
02:40:45.90 --> 02:40:51.14 Here's a few common sense rules which when followed will enable any officer to play
02:40:51.14 --> 02:40:54.26 his part more effectively in the counseling of men.
02:40:54.26 --> 02:40:58.10 And excess of expression is a failing.
02:40:58.10 --> 02:41:03.62 So when you give away your facial expression, looks all that's a failing.
02:41:03.62 --> 02:41:08.86 To listen well is the prelude toward pondering carefully and speaking wisely.
02:41:08.86 --> 02:41:12.26 Listen, got to listen.
02:41:12.26 --> 02:41:18.90 To refuse with kindness is more winning than to acquiesce ungratiously.
02:41:18.90 --> 02:41:21.50 That's a good one.
02:41:21.50 --> 02:41:24.62 Just anyone I don't think it's going to be rather than all right.
02:41:24.62 --> 02:41:25.62 Yeah.
02:41:25.62 --> 02:41:27.86 That's something you've got to deal with with your wife.
02:41:27.86 --> 02:41:29.26 Your wife wants to go do something.
02:41:29.26 --> 02:41:31.82 If you'd be better to say, you know what I'm thinking?
02:41:31.82 --> 02:41:32.90 All right, let's not do that tonight.
02:41:32.90 --> 02:41:35.06 Let's do this other thing instead.
02:41:35.06 --> 02:41:36.38 As opposed to all right, fine.
02:41:36.38 --> 02:41:39.94 We'll go to your friend's house.
02:41:39.94 --> 02:41:41.38 Don't want to do that.
02:41:41.38 --> 02:41:43.42 Yeah, I feel like a dick when you get there.
02:41:43.42 --> 02:41:44.66 Yeah.
02:41:44.66 --> 02:41:50.74 To note another man's mood and become congenial to it is the surest way to engage
02:41:50.74 --> 02:41:53.30 his confidence.
02:41:53.30 --> 02:41:59.98 Decisions which are holy of the heart and not of the mind will ultimately do hurt
02:41:59.98 --> 02:42:02.98 to both places.
02:42:02.98 --> 02:42:03.98 Use your logic.
02:42:03.98 --> 02:42:06.14 Don't get emotional.
02:42:06.14 --> 02:42:09.98 No man will talk freely if met by silence.
02:42:09.98 --> 02:42:17.18 But an intelligent question encourages frankness above all else.
02:42:17.18 --> 02:42:22.78 When a man loses possession of himself, it is the more reason that the other should
02:42:22.78 --> 02:42:28.30 tighten his reserve legit.
02:42:28.30 --> 02:42:29.38 This is a good one.
02:42:29.38 --> 02:42:38.54 To express pity for a man does not serve to restore him and put him above pity.
02:42:38.54 --> 02:42:43.82 And a man is so burdened by a personal problem that it shuts out all else.
02:42:43.82 --> 02:42:47.78 He must be led to something else.
02:42:47.78 --> 02:42:53.82 And the last one here, impudent tactics can undo the wise strategy.
02:42:53.82 --> 02:42:57.18 And that happens at every level that happens in a ward, happens in business.
02:42:57.18 --> 02:43:03.14 Got a great strategy, but the guys on the ground are really not doing it tactically well.
02:43:03.14 --> 02:43:07.50 Doesn't matter the strategy you're going to fail.
02:43:07.50 --> 02:43:14.30 The encountering like all else in military life has a combat purpose.
02:43:14.30 --> 02:43:19.38 Other things being equal, the tactical unity of men working together in combat will
02:43:19.38 --> 02:43:25.58 be in ratio to their knowledge and sympathetic understanding of each other.
02:43:25.58 --> 02:43:31.34 Whatever the cause, aloofness, on the part of the officer can only produce a further
02:43:31.34 --> 02:43:42.62 withdrawal on that part of the man, aloofness.
02:43:42.62 --> 02:43:50.94 Now the last section of this book was really devastating on my highlighter.
02:43:50.94 --> 02:43:56.14 It's called Americans in combat.
02:43:56.14 --> 02:44:00.66 The command and control of men in combat can be mastered by junior leaders of American forces
02:44:00.66 --> 02:44:04.90 short of actual experience under enemy fire.
02:44:04.90 --> 02:44:09.70 It is altogether possible for a young officer as first time in battle to be in total possession
02:44:09.70 --> 02:44:15.90 of his faculties and moving by instinct to do the right thing provided that he has made
02:44:15.90 --> 02:44:20.62 the most of his training opportunities.
02:44:20.62 --> 02:44:26.26 Exercise in the maneuvering of men is only an elementary introduction to this educational
02:44:26.26 --> 02:44:27.50 process.
02:44:27.50 --> 02:44:33.54 The basic requirement is continuing study first of the nature of men, second of the techniques
02:44:33.54 --> 02:44:40.70 which produce unified action and last of the history of past operations which are covered
02:44:40.70 --> 02:44:42.94 by an abundant literature.
02:44:42.94 --> 02:44:45.74 That's how you got to get ready for combat.
02:44:45.74 --> 02:44:47.54 Those things right there.
02:44:47.54 --> 02:44:52.10 Now there are a few simple and fundamental propositions which the armed services subscribe
02:44:52.10 --> 02:44:58.66 in saying to officer corps what may be expected of the average man of the United States under
02:44:58.66 --> 02:45:01.10 battle conditions.
02:45:01.10 --> 02:45:07.22 Generally speaking they have held true of Americans in times past from Lexington to Okinawa.
02:45:07.22 --> 02:45:13.04 The fighting establishment builds its discipline, training, code of conduct and public
02:45:13.04 --> 02:45:19.30 policy around these ideas believing that what served yesterday will also be the one best
02:45:19.30 --> 02:45:21.30 way tomorrow.
02:45:21.30 --> 02:45:26.50 And for so long as our traditions and our system of freedom survives, these propositions
02:45:26.50 --> 02:45:34.66 are when led with courage and intelligence and American will fight as willingly as and
02:45:34.66 --> 02:45:39.30 as efficiently as any fighter in world history.
02:45:39.30 --> 02:45:41.86 I can occur with that.
02:45:41.86 --> 02:45:46.66 His keenness and endurance and war will be in proportion to the zeal and inspiration
02:45:46.66 --> 02:45:49.46 of his leadership.
02:45:49.46 --> 02:45:56.82 He is resourceful and imaginative and the best results will always flow from encouraging
02:45:56.82 --> 02:46:02.54 him to use his brain along with his spirit.
02:46:02.54 --> 02:46:08.42 Under combat conditions he will reserve his greatest loyalty for the officer who is most
02:46:08.42 --> 02:46:15.46 resourceful in the tactical employment of his forces and most careful to avoid unnecessary
02:46:15.46 --> 02:46:18.22 losses.
02:46:18.22 --> 02:46:22.34 So the soldiers going to know if you're throwing bodies away they're going to know it.
02:46:22.34 --> 02:46:23.74 The same thing in the business world.
02:46:23.74 --> 02:46:28.94 I've worked with a lot of companies where they do their utmost to let's say there's a
02:46:28.94 --> 02:46:34.10 downturn in the market and they're going to fire some people and they do their best
02:46:34.10 --> 02:46:35.74 to mitigate that.
02:46:35.74 --> 02:46:37.26 That develops loyalty.
02:46:37.26 --> 02:46:40.46 That makes them fight harder when the market turns back around.
02:46:40.46 --> 02:46:44.26 Now sometimes that can be a problem because people try and be so loyal that they'd run
02:46:44.26 --> 02:46:45.46 their business in the ground.
02:46:45.46 --> 02:46:50.18 And they fail.
02:46:50.18 --> 02:46:55.70 Back to the book except on a Hollywood lot there is no such thing as an American fighter
02:46:55.70 --> 02:46:57.46 type.
02:46:57.46 --> 02:47:03.14 Our best-month men come in all colors, shapes and sizes.
02:47:03.14 --> 02:47:10.18 They appear from every section of the nation including the territories.
02:47:10.18 --> 02:47:16.54 In battle, Americans do not tend to fluctuate between emotional extremes in complete
02:47:16.54 --> 02:47:22.42 rejection one day and exaltation the next according to the changes in the situation.
02:47:22.42 --> 02:47:27.58 They continue on the whole on a fairly even kill when a going is tough and when things
02:47:27.58 --> 02:47:30.50 are breaking their way.
02:47:30.50 --> 02:47:36.62 Even when heavily shocked by battle losses they tend to bound back quickly.
02:47:36.62 --> 02:47:43.50 Though their griping is incestant, their natural outlook is on the optimistic side and
02:47:43.50 --> 02:47:52.06 they react unfavorably to the officer who looks eternally on the dark side.
02:47:52.06 --> 02:47:58.66 Next, during battle American officers are not expected either to drive their men or to be
02:47:58.66 --> 02:48:02.06 forever in the van as if praying to be shot.
02:48:02.06 --> 02:48:07.18 So the van is like on the front lines, the front of your formation.
02:48:07.18 --> 02:48:13.30 So long as they are with their men taking the same chances as their men and showing a firm
02:48:13.30 --> 02:48:19.34 grasp of the situation and of the line of action which should be followed, the men will
02:48:19.34 --> 02:48:22.30 go forward.
02:48:22.30 --> 02:48:28.78 In any situation of extreme pressure or more exhaustion where men cannot otherwise be rallied
02:48:28.78 --> 02:48:36.22 and led forward, officers are expected to do the actual physical act of leading such as
02:48:36.22 --> 02:48:42.46 performing as first scout or point, even though this means taking over what would normally
02:48:42.46 --> 02:48:45.70 be an enlisted man's function.
02:48:45.70 --> 02:48:52.30 The normal next, the normal, grigarius American is not at his best when playing alone
02:48:52.30 --> 02:48:56.26 handed or tactically isolated part in battle.
02:48:56.26 --> 02:49:00.18 He is not a comacosio or a one-man torpedo.
02:49:00.18 --> 02:49:05.58 Consequently, the best tactical results obtained from those dispositions and methods which
02:49:05.58 --> 02:49:10.98 link the power of one man to that of another.
02:49:10.98 --> 02:49:16.02 Men who feel strange with their unit, having been carelessly received by it and indifantly
02:49:16.02 --> 02:49:22.06 handled will rarely, if ever, fight strongly and courageously.
02:49:22.06 --> 02:49:28.54 And if treated with common decency and respect, they will perform like men.
02:49:28.54 --> 02:49:31.34 So that's just talking when you check in somewhere.
02:49:31.34 --> 02:49:34.34 If you're in a military and you get somebody that checks in, take care of them.
02:49:34.34 --> 02:49:35.34 Welcome.
02:49:35.34 --> 02:49:37.06 If you're to company in somebody checks in, take care of them.
02:49:37.06 --> 02:49:43.70 Welcome, show them around to sign a mentor, get them in the game.
02:49:43.70 --> 02:49:51.86 To lie to American troops to cover up a blundering combat rarely serves any valid purpose.
02:49:51.86 --> 02:49:57.78 They have a good sense of combat and an uncanny instinct for ferooding out the truth when
02:49:57.78 --> 02:50:01.10 anything goes wrong tactically.
02:50:01.10 --> 02:50:09.30 They will excuse mistakes, but they will not forgive being treated like children.
02:50:09.30 --> 02:50:14.90 Basic leadership.
02:50:14.90 --> 02:50:16.10 Good one here.
02:50:16.10 --> 02:50:21.90 And spit and polish are laid on so heavily that they become onerous.
02:50:21.90 --> 02:50:27.22 And the ranks cannot see any legitimate connection between the requirements and the development
02:50:27.22 --> 02:50:30.98 of an attitude which will serve a clear fighting purpose.
02:50:30.98 --> 02:50:36.86 It is to be questioned that the exaction serves any good object, whatever.
02:50:36.86 --> 02:50:39.54 So again, I'm like leaning in the sealed teams.
02:50:39.54 --> 02:50:47.50 I'm probably the extreme level of military bearing and uniformity, but I'm definitely not
02:50:47.50 --> 02:50:49.86 a believer that you got everything.
02:50:49.86 --> 02:50:53.46 Every single thing spit and polish all day long.
02:50:53.46 --> 02:50:57.22 And they're saying clearly here that if you go so far in that direction and people don't
02:50:57.22 --> 02:50:59.50 make any sense of it, it's not going to be good.
02:50:59.50 --> 02:51:03.98 I mean, even picture, you know, hack worth was like Mr. Spit and polish.
02:51:03.98 --> 02:51:05.66 Look at pictures of hack worth and Vietnam.
02:51:05.66 --> 02:51:10.66 You wouldn't even wear a rank.
02:51:10.66 --> 02:51:13.90 He makes one of the guys from that come into the camp that look like they're in parade
02:51:13.90 --> 02:51:16.18 ground uniforms.
02:51:16.18 --> 02:51:26.70 I saw a quote, like yesterday, said a spotless house is the sign of a wasted life, which
02:51:26.70 --> 02:51:33.86 when I saw it, I tend to disagree with a lot because it basically takes one kind of perspective
02:51:33.86 --> 02:51:37.70 and makes it into this thing.
02:51:37.70 --> 02:51:44.46 But with this one, I was like, well, or it means you clean your house all the time.
02:51:44.46 --> 02:51:46.46 That's where you know, maybe you're disciplined.
02:51:46.46 --> 02:51:49.46 You clean your stuff, including your house.
02:51:49.46 --> 02:51:50.46 I don't know.
02:51:50.46 --> 02:51:51.46 Maybe take care of your house.
02:51:51.46 --> 02:51:52.98 Maybe you're a clean person.
02:51:52.98 --> 02:51:54.86 That's not a waste of life by the way.
02:51:54.86 --> 02:52:00.42 Yeah, I think that's an extreme statement, but I think the underlying message is, hey,
02:52:00.42 --> 02:52:01.42 live a little.
02:52:01.42 --> 02:52:03.82 It's basically, yeah, in a way, it's kind of the
02:52:03.82 --> 02:52:05.90 message there is kind of what you're saying.
02:52:05.90 --> 02:52:09.74 If you take it literally, yeah, that could you could go too far down that road.
02:52:09.74 --> 02:52:13.26 But just take it as a message.
02:52:13.26 --> 02:52:15.10 I think the message is fairly clear.
02:52:15.10 --> 02:52:16.78 And I, I get some more to agree with that.
02:52:16.78 --> 02:52:20.38 Yeah, like you spent your whole life making sure everything in your house is clean.
02:52:20.38 --> 02:52:26.70 Yeah, you know, they say also, like the highly polished samurai sword that's never been
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:33.70 used in battle is a lot less valuable to me than the switchblade knife that's rusty from
02:52:33.70 --> 02:52:34.70 blood.
02:52:34.70 --> 02:52:35.70 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:52:35.70 --> 02:52:37.70 K-bar that's rusty from blood.
02:52:37.70 --> 02:52:38.70 Yeah.
02:52:38.70 --> 02:52:39.70 Yeah.
02:52:39.70 --> 02:52:42.82 Next one.
02:52:42.82 --> 02:52:48.10 On the other hand, because standards of discipline and courtesy are designed for the
02:52:48.10 --> 02:52:53.22 express purpose of furthering control under the extraordinary frictions and presions of
02:52:53.22 --> 02:53:01.10 the battlefield, their maintenance under combat conditions is as necessary as during training.
02:53:01.10 --> 02:53:07.42 This and respect are the marks of military alertness, no matter how trying the circumstances.
02:53:07.42 --> 02:53:12.70 But courtesy starts at the top in the dealing of any officer with his subordinates and in
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:17.34 the decent regard for their loyalty, intelligence and manhood.
02:53:17.34 --> 02:53:23.30 So even though you can't be over-discipline, you've to go to have the discipline.
02:53:23.30 --> 02:53:29.30 Next though Americans enjoy relatively about to fall.
02:53:29.30 --> 02:53:35.62 Even luxurious standard of living in their home environment, they do not have to be pampered,
02:53:35.62 --> 02:53:42.62 spoon fed, or overfilled with every comfort and convenience to keep them steadfast and
02:53:42.62 --> 02:53:45.22 devoted once war comes.
02:53:45.22 --> 02:53:49.94 They are by nature rugged men and in the field they will respond most perfectly when
02:53:49.94 --> 02:53:53.90 called on to play a rugged part.
02:53:53.90 --> 02:53:59.26 Soft handling will soften even the best men.
02:53:59.26 --> 02:54:04.42 But even the weak man will develop a new vigor and confidence in the face of necessary
02:54:04.42 --> 02:54:12.02 hardship if moved by a leadership which is courageously making the best of a bad situation.
02:54:12.02 --> 02:54:14.62 It's just awesome.
02:54:14.62 --> 02:54:22.42 Soft handling will soften even the best men and the weak man will come around for a necessary
02:54:22.42 --> 02:54:23.42 hardship.
02:54:23.42 --> 02:54:26.22 You notice they put that word in their nest and not just being them up for no reason.
02:54:26.22 --> 02:54:30.70 They gotta see why it is.
02:54:30.70 --> 02:54:35.58 Next, extravagance and wastefulness is somewhat rooted in the American character because
02:54:35.58 --> 02:54:37.46 of our mode of life.
02:54:37.46 --> 02:54:42.26 When our men enter the military service, there's a strong holdover from their civilian
02:54:42.26 --> 02:54:43.26 habits.
02:54:43.26 --> 02:54:47.06 Even under fighting conditions, they tend to be wasteful of drinking water, food, munition,
02:54:47.06 --> 02:54:51.86 and other vital supply when such things are made to accessible.
02:54:51.86 --> 02:54:56.78 They tend to throw them away rather than conserve them in the general interests.
02:54:56.78 --> 02:54:59.82 This is a distinct weakness during combat.
02:54:59.82 --> 02:55:05.82 When conservation of all supplies, the touchstone of success, the regulating of all supply
02:55:05.82 --> 02:55:15.62 and the preventing of waste in any form is the prime obligation of every officer.
02:55:15.62 --> 02:55:19.62 Be frugal.
02:55:19.62 --> 02:55:22.50 Next, under the conditions of battle.
02:55:22.50 --> 02:55:27.70 Any extra work, exercise, maneuver, or marching, which does not serve a clear and direct
02:55:27.70 --> 02:55:31.30 operational purpose is unjustifiable.
02:55:31.30 --> 02:55:36.78 The supreme object is to keep men as physically fresh and mentally alert as possible.
02:55:36.78 --> 02:55:41.38 Tired men take fright and are half whipped before the battle opens.
02:55:41.38 --> 02:55:44.70 War now officers cannot make clear decisions.
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:50.18 The conservation of men's powers, not the exhaustion thereof, is the successful way of
02:55:50.18 --> 02:55:56.18 operations.
02:55:56.18 --> 02:56:02.70 Next, when forces are committed to combat, it is vital that not one unnecessary pound
02:56:02.70 --> 02:56:06.14 be put on any man's back.
02:56:06.14 --> 02:56:11.14 Lightness of foot is the key to speed of movement and the increase of fire power.
02:56:11.14 --> 02:56:16.10 And judging of these things, every officer's thoughts should be on the optimistic side.
02:56:16.10 --> 02:56:19.88 It is better to take the chance that men will manage to get by on a little less than to
02:56:19.88 --> 02:56:27.34 overload them through over cautious reckoning of every possible contingency thereby destroying
02:56:27.34 --> 02:56:31.70 their power to do anything effectively.
02:56:31.70 --> 02:56:33.10 Every pound counts.
02:56:33.10 --> 02:56:40.10 They used to when I was at a team two, they had winter warfare plethora and so you'd be up burning
02:56:40.10 --> 02:56:47.18 calories on skis and those guys were so anal about making their gear as light as possible
02:56:47.18 --> 02:56:48.18 was pretty impressive.
02:56:48.18 --> 02:56:51.42 So, you know when you got a backpack or something and it's got straps, you know, that
02:56:51.42 --> 02:56:53.70 you can loosen up or tighten up.
02:56:53.70 --> 02:56:59.70 They would through the whole backpack, they would cut off any excess strap would be gone.
02:56:59.70 --> 02:57:07.14 Just get everything as light as possible.
02:57:07.14 --> 02:57:10.30 It's kind of a good strategy to follow when you travel.
02:57:10.30 --> 02:57:14.30 You know, you know, you know, how like you know what the funny thing is, too, is I've
02:57:14.30 --> 02:57:15.30 got this now.
02:57:15.30 --> 02:57:16.30 I've got this pretty down.
02:57:16.30 --> 02:57:19.82 What I'm like, you know what if I don't have this, if I don't bring this and I need
02:57:19.82 --> 02:57:21.14 it, I'm just going to buy it.
02:57:21.14 --> 02:57:22.82 But go to a wherever and buy it.
02:57:22.82 --> 02:57:23.82 No factor.
02:57:23.82 --> 02:57:30.82 No.
02:57:30.82 --> 02:57:33.82 Yeah.
02:57:33.82 --> 02:57:30.82 And because there's kind of those two like schools that thought, I don't know, whatever, two ways to think about it.
02:57:30.82 --> 02:57:32.10 Where the person is like, I might need it.
02:57:32.10 --> 02:57:33.10 So I'm going to bring it.
02:57:33.10 --> 02:57:38.38 Another person is like, if I can't think of a specific time that I'm going to need this on the
02:57:38.38 --> 02:57:39.90 strip, I'm not going to bring it.
02:57:39.90 --> 02:57:43.90 And just like how you say it, if I need it, I'll buy it there.
02:57:43.90 --> 02:57:45.90 Travel light for you tonight.
02:57:45.90 --> 02:57:47.90 Yeah, that's all right.
02:57:47.90 --> 02:57:48.90 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:57:48.90 --> 02:57:50.90 It's all over the level.
02:57:50.90 --> 02:57:56.54 Just unity of action develops from fullness of information.
02:57:56.54 --> 02:58:02.34 In combat, all ranks have to know what is being done and why it is being done.
02:58:02.34 --> 02:58:07.18 If confusion is to be kept to a minimum, this holds true in all types of operations
02:58:07.18 --> 02:58:11.14 or whatever the service.
02:58:11.14 --> 02:58:16.54 However, a surplus of information clouds the mind and may sometimes depress the spirit.
02:58:16.54 --> 02:58:17.54 We can take one example.
02:58:17.54 --> 02:58:22.66 Commander might be confronted by a complex situation and a solution may be a continuing
02:58:22.66 --> 02:58:25.62 operation in three distinct phases.
02:58:25.62 --> 02:58:29.98 It would be advisable that all hands be told the complete detail of phase A, but it might
02:58:29.98 --> 02:58:35.06 be equally sensible that his subordinates only his subordinates who are closest to him be made
02:58:35.06 --> 02:58:38.66 fully informed about phase B and phase C.
02:58:38.66 --> 02:58:43.34 All plans and combat are subject to modification as to circumstances dictate.
02:58:43.34 --> 02:58:44.58 This being the case.
02:58:44.58 --> 02:58:46.66 It is not better.
02:58:46.66 --> 02:58:53.90 It is better not to model the men by filling their minds with a seemingly conflict of ideas.
02:58:53.90 --> 02:58:55.62 A conflict in ideas.
02:58:55.62 --> 02:59:00.18 More important still, if the grand object seems too vast and formidable, even the
02:59:00.18 --> 02:59:04.26 first step toward it may appear doubly difficult.
02:59:04.26 --> 02:59:10.50 Fulness of information does not void the other principle that one thing at a time carefully
02:59:10.50 --> 02:59:18.78 organized all down the line is the surest way, prioritizing execute.
02:59:18.78 --> 02:59:24.34 There is no next, there is no excuse for malingering or cowardice during battle.
02:59:24.34 --> 02:59:30.34 Is the task of leadership to stop it by whatever means would seem to be the surest cure
02:59:30.34 --> 02:59:38.18 always making certain that in doing so it will not make a matter worse.
02:59:38.18 --> 02:59:39.34 Next.
02:59:39.34 --> 02:59:44.54 The armed services recognize that there are occasional individual school nervous and spiritual
02:59:44.54 --> 02:59:49.98 makeup may be such that they are road rapidly and may suffer complete breakdown under combat
02:59:49.98 --> 02:59:51.70 conditions.
02:59:51.70 --> 02:59:58.42 They still may be a holy loyal and conscientious men capable of doing duty elsewhere.
02:59:58.42 --> 02:59:59.78 Men are not alike.
02:59:59.78 --> 03:00:05.02 In some, however, willing the spirit, the flesh may be too weak.
03:00:05.02 --> 03:00:13.34 The punish, degrade or in any way, humiliate such men is not more cruel than ignorant.
03:00:13.34 --> 03:00:17.94 When the good faith of any individual has been repeatedly demonstrated in the earlier service,
03:00:17.94 --> 03:00:22.62 he deserves the benefit of the doubt from his superior pending study of his case by medical
03:00:22.62 --> 03:00:23.62 authority.
03:00:23.62 --> 03:00:28.26 But if the man has been a bad actor consistently, his officers were wanted in proceeding
03:00:28.26 --> 03:00:33.90 on the assumption that his combat failure is just one more grave moral dereliction.
03:00:33.90 --> 03:00:39.66 The failed to take proper action against such a man can only work unusual hardship on the
03:00:39.66 --> 03:00:45.14 majority trying to do the duty.
03:00:45.14 --> 03:00:46.14 Next.
03:00:46.14 --> 03:00:50.78 The United States abides by the laws of war.
03:00:50.78 --> 03:00:57.82 Its armed forces in dealing with all other peoples are expected to comply with the laws of
03:00:57.82 --> 03:01:01.74 war in the spirit and to the letter.
03:01:01.74 --> 03:01:06.62 In waging war, we do not terrorize helpless non-combatants.
03:01:06.62 --> 03:01:12.98 If it is within our power to avoid doing so, want in killing, torture, cruelty, or the
03:01:12.98 --> 03:01:19.30 working of unusual and unnecessary hardship on enemy prisoners or populations is not justified
03:01:19.30 --> 03:01:22.38 under any circumstance.
03:01:22.38 --> 03:01:28.78 Likewise, respect for the reign of law as that term is understood by the United States's
03:01:28.78 --> 03:01:33.86 expected to follow the flag wherever it goes.
03:01:33.86 --> 03:01:40.10 Piliging, looting, and other excesses are as a moral as unmoorled where Americans are operating
03:01:40.10 --> 03:01:46.30 under military law as they are living together under civil code.
03:01:46.30 --> 03:01:50.98 Nonetheless, some men in the American services will loot and destroy properly unless
03:01:50.98 --> 03:01:54.54 they are restrained by fear of punishment.
03:01:54.54 --> 03:01:58.06 War loses violence and disorder.
03:01:58.06 --> 03:02:02.82 The inflames, passions and makes it relatively easy for the individual to get away with
03:02:02.82 --> 03:02:05.70 unlawful actions.
03:02:05.70 --> 03:02:11.06 But it does not lessen the gravity of his offense or make it less necessary that constituted
03:02:11.06 --> 03:02:14.14 authority put him down.
03:02:14.14 --> 03:02:21.02 The main safeguard against lawlessness and who lunagonism in any armed body is the integrity
03:02:21.02 --> 03:02:23.86 of its officers.
03:02:23.86 --> 03:02:29.98 And men know that their commander is absolutely opposed to such excesses and will take
03:02:29.98 --> 03:02:36.78 forceful action to repress any breach of discipline they will conform.
03:02:36.78 --> 03:02:44.26 But when an officer winks at any degradation by his men, it is no different than if he had
03:02:44.26 --> 03:02:47.38 committed the act.
03:02:47.38 --> 03:02:51.94 Remember that one, young leaders out there on the battlefield.
03:02:51.94 --> 03:02:56.06 An officer winks at any degradation of his men.
03:02:56.06 --> 03:02:58.62 There's no different than if he had committed the act.
03:02:58.62 --> 03:03:04.70 And if you hold the discipline, if you hold the discipline, they will conform.
03:03:04.70 --> 03:03:10.38 If they know where you fall, where you stand, I should say, if they know where you stand,
03:03:10.38 --> 03:03:14.26 they will conform.
03:03:14.26 --> 03:03:20.02 Next, on the field of sport, Americans always talking up to keep nerve steady and to generate
03:03:20.02 --> 03:03:21.74 confidence.
03:03:21.74 --> 03:03:25.94 The need is even greater on the field of war and the same treatment will have no less
03:03:25.94 --> 03:03:26.94 effect.
03:03:26.94 --> 03:03:31.30 When men are afraid, they go silent.
03:03:31.30 --> 03:03:35.98 Silence of itself further intensifies the fear.
03:03:35.98 --> 03:03:42.06 The resumption of speech is the beginning of thoughtful, collected action.
03:03:42.06 --> 03:03:47.50 For self-evidently, two or more men cannot join strength and work intelligently together
03:03:47.50 --> 03:03:50.02 until they know one another's thoughts.
03:03:50.02 --> 03:03:57.02 Once a importantly, all training is an exercise in getting men to open up and become articulate,
03:03:57.02 --> 03:04:06.94 articulate even as it is a process in conditioning them physically to move strongly together.
03:04:06.94 --> 03:04:14.98 Once again, step and even talking is action that starts to dispeel fear.
03:04:14.98 --> 03:04:19.50 Next, inspection is more important in the face of the enemy than during training because
03:04:19.50 --> 03:04:25.38 a found piece of a found piece may mean a lost battle and overlooked sick man may infect
03:04:25.38 --> 03:04:29.90 a fortress and a misled message can cost a war.
03:04:29.90 --> 03:04:35.30 In virtue of his position, every junior leader is an inspector and the obligation to make
03:04:35.30 --> 03:04:42.94 certain that his force at all times is inspection proof is unremitting.
03:04:42.94 --> 03:04:49.70 And the last one I'm going to read to close out this book is here in battle crisis.
03:04:49.70 --> 03:04:56.66 A majority of Americans present present will respond to any man who has the will and the
03:04:56.66 --> 03:05:01.54 brains to give them a clear, intelligent order.
03:05:01.54 --> 03:05:07.62 They will follow the lowest ranking man present if he obviously knows what he is doing
03:05:07.62 --> 03:05:13.14 and is morally the master of the situation.
03:05:13.14 --> 03:05:26.82 But they will not obey a chuckle head if he has nothing in his favor but his rank.
03:05:26.82 --> 03:05:35.50 And that's it for this book and I think that closing statement.
03:05:35.50 --> 03:05:39.06 Don't be a chuckle head.
03:05:39.06 --> 03:05:44.54 Don't be a chuckle head and this is talked about earlier that they will follow the lowest
03:05:44.54 --> 03:05:45.54 man.
03:05:45.54 --> 03:05:51.46 The lowest-making ranking man present if he knows what he is doing and is morally the master
03:05:51.46 --> 03:05:58.02 of the situation and can give a clear, intelligent order.
03:05:58.02 --> 03:06:01.62 And I think the rest of you know if you're a chuckle head people are going to listen to
03:06:01.62 --> 03:06:04.46 you just because of your rank and talk about that all the time.
03:06:04.46 --> 03:06:08.90 You shouldn't use your rank.
03:06:08.90 --> 03:06:17.92 And I think this book actually gives some pretty obvious ways to avoid being a chuckle
03:06:17.92 --> 03:06:18.92 head.
03:06:18.92 --> 03:06:28.98 Be humble, become, educate yourself, work out hard, physical, physicality is important.
03:06:28.98 --> 03:06:32.66 It's all the stuff, same stuff that we talk about all the time.
03:06:32.66 --> 03:06:35.42 And again, these are universal.
03:06:35.42 --> 03:06:36.82 And I know we got a lot of listeners that are over.
03:06:36.82 --> 03:06:43.14 See, this stuff is supplying to Americans for this applies basically worldwide at least
03:06:43.14 --> 03:06:46.62 Western world.
03:06:46.62 --> 03:06:48.18 And they've stood the test a time.
03:06:48.18 --> 03:06:50.78 They work today.
03:06:50.78 --> 03:06:53.54 So follow them.
03:06:53.54 --> 03:06:57.98 And cold blind.
03:06:57.98 --> 03:07:04.22 And lead with this lead and everything you do and start by leading yourself with these
03:07:04.22 --> 03:07:15.42 principles because if you can't, there's no way that you can lead others if you can't
03:07:15.42 --> 03:07:18.66 lead yourself.
03:07:18.66 --> 03:07:23.46 And I'll tell you where little over the three-hour mark right now.
03:07:23.46 --> 03:07:28.54 So it doesn't look like we're going to be doing Q&A this episode.
03:07:28.54 --> 03:07:32.98 So if anyone is out, they're still listening at this point.
03:07:32.98 --> 03:07:37.46 And they want to know how to support the podcast.
03:07:37.46 --> 03:07:39.22 Echo, tell them how to do it.
03:07:39.22 --> 03:07:42.82 Well, there's a few ways.
03:07:42.82 --> 03:07:48.10 Yeah, so let's start with the, a lot of times I feel like I'm, it's just like kind of
03:07:48.10 --> 03:07:49.10 repetitive.
03:07:49.10 --> 03:07:50.22 Well, it is repetitive.
03:07:50.22 --> 03:07:51.22 Yeah.
03:07:51.22 --> 03:07:55.46 We've already had people listening for three plus hours at this point.
03:07:55.46 --> 03:07:57.30 We can feel free to move quickly, I think.
03:07:57.30 --> 03:07:58.30 Yeah, I think so.
03:07:58.30 --> 03:07:59.58 But here's the thing though.
03:07:59.58 --> 03:08:00.58 Oh, there's a butt.
03:08:00.58 --> 03:08:02.54 I did, yeah, I did more thinking.
03:08:02.54 --> 03:08:08.34 Where what if this is the first time somebody was listening or maybe the second time
03:08:08.34 --> 03:08:10.14 won't be as repetitive.
03:08:10.14 --> 03:08:15.86 Okay, but if it's person that they're going to listen to other ones, sure to go back.
03:08:15.86 --> 03:08:18.34 Yep.
03:08:18.34 --> 03:08:19.74 And they can listen to one of those episodes.
03:08:19.74 --> 03:08:21.14 That's an hour and a half.
03:08:21.14 --> 03:08:23.54 And they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to listen to a little bit more.
03:08:23.54 --> 03:08:28.78 But right now, if we go long right now, they may not listen at all.
03:08:28.78 --> 03:08:29.78 Yeah.
03:08:29.78 --> 03:08:30.62 Now, some people say, what do it's fun?
03:08:30.62 --> 03:08:31.62 We like that.
03:08:31.62 --> 03:08:32.62 No.
03:08:32.62 --> 03:08:33.62 No.
03:08:33.62 --> 03:08:34.62 Nothing is fun after three hours.
03:08:34.62 --> 03:08:35.62 I don't know.
03:08:35.62 --> 03:08:36.62 I went long.
03:08:36.62 --> 03:08:38.54 Well, there's so much good information in this book though.
03:08:38.54 --> 03:08:39.38 I went long.
03:08:39.38 --> 03:08:40.38 I'm sorry.
03:08:40.38 --> 03:08:42.90 But I'm not really sorry.
03:08:42.90 --> 03:08:43.90 There's a good information.
03:08:43.90 --> 03:08:44.90 Yeah, that's the game.
03:08:44.90 --> 03:08:45.90 It's good.
03:08:45.90 --> 03:08:48.50 But I think we could proceed quickly.
03:08:48.50 --> 03:08:49.50 That's what I think.
03:08:49.50 --> 03:08:50.50 Yeah, sure.
03:08:50.50 --> 03:08:51.50 I know no banter.
03:08:51.50 --> 03:08:53.26 You know, I know you got things you want to talk about.
03:08:53.26 --> 03:08:54.26 I'm not even in it.
03:08:54.26 --> 03:08:55.26 With the stuff.
03:08:55.26 --> 03:08:56.26 I'm going to avoid the banter.
03:08:56.26 --> 03:09:01.74 The key here is really to, okay, look, I could, okay, we'll go into it on it.
03:09:01.74 --> 03:09:06.86 Supplementation, you know, sometimes, hey, I don't need supplements.
03:09:06.86 --> 03:09:10.66 I have a great diet or I'm just not into it just in general.
03:09:10.66 --> 03:09:17.06 I have to successfully convey the importance of supplementation or at the very least the
03:09:17.06 --> 03:09:18.06 value.
03:09:18.06 --> 03:09:19.06 Go ahead.
03:09:19.06 --> 03:09:21.06 So I'm not going to banter with you.
03:09:21.06 --> 03:09:24.18 I'm just going to go ahead and get after it right here.
03:09:24.18 --> 03:09:26.98 This far as late because you can, you know, all right.
03:09:26.98 --> 03:09:32.06 You know, for a chocolate real quick, on it supplements, if you didn't already know,
03:09:32.06 --> 03:09:38.02 krill oil or EDC, okay, our EDC, every day consumption of supplements, essential krill
03:09:38.02 --> 03:09:40.54 oil for your joints.
03:09:40.54 --> 03:09:43.06 And this is good because this is the legit one.
03:09:43.06 --> 03:09:47.94 It's not the one where they kill a bunch of krill, grind them up and then sell it to you.
03:09:47.94 --> 03:09:51.14 It's like the real deal that helps you.
03:09:51.14 --> 03:09:56.30 I could tell you the story about how it helped me, but let's do the other, listen to the
03:09:56.30 --> 03:09:58.86 other 52 podcasts if you want to hear that story.
03:09:58.86 --> 03:10:04.94 Yeah, just understand if you're going for results on it supplements, krill oil, EDC, krill
03:10:04.94 --> 03:10:10.38 oil, alpha brain, shrimp tech, warrior bars, even though those aren't really supplements,
03:10:10.38 --> 03:10:11.94 they're like, but you do eat them every day.
03:10:11.94 --> 03:10:14.86 Yeah, every day consumption.
03:10:14.86 --> 03:10:17.50 And I got the, the pre-workout.
03:10:17.50 --> 03:10:18.50 How was that?
03:10:18.50 --> 03:10:19.50 Good.
03:10:19.50 --> 03:10:20.50 I'm going to give it a shot.
03:10:20.50 --> 03:10:22.06 Non-stimulate, by the way.
03:10:22.06 --> 03:10:24.06 So that's not a gittery.
03:10:24.06 --> 03:10:25.42 Yeah, nothing like this.
03:10:25.42 --> 03:10:29.58 And it's, um, it's like there's like earth grown ingredients in there as well.
03:10:29.58 --> 03:10:30.58 Good.
03:10:30.58 --> 03:10:31.58 It's actually tastes good.
03:10:31.58 --> 03:10:34.22 You know, so on it calls things earth grown ingredients.
03:10:34.22 --> 03:10:36.14 I'm just going to like know it sounds cool.
03:10:36.14 --> 03:10:37.14 Where else are they grown?
03:10:37.14 --> 03:10:38.14 Space?
03:10:38.14 --> 03:10:42.02 And when it's the cooler, if they grow, it's space or subterranean or something, what's
03:10:42.02 --> 03:10:43.02 up?
03:10:43.02 --> 03:10:44.02 Why are they trying to make it sound cool?
03:10:44.02 --> 03:10:45.02 So what's good stuff?
03:10:45.02 --> 03:10:46.02 How would they say that?
03:10:46.02 --> 03:10:47.02 Well, the answer is grown.
03:10:47.02 --> 03:10:49.78 The answer to that is lab grown.
03:10:49.78 --> 03:10:53.70 If you can roast stuff in the lab or just concoct it, you know, chemically and
03:10:53.70 --> 03:10:54.70 a lab quiet.
03:10:54.70 --> 03:10:57.42 So I'm just saying that's the differentiator.
03:10:57.42 --> 03:10:58.42 You win.
03:10:58.42 --> 03:10:59.42 Which is good.
03:10:59.42 --> 03:11:00.42 You win.
03:11:00.42 --> 03:11:01.42 Earth grown is actually cool.
03:11:01.42 --> 03:11:02.42 It's just a sound cool.
03:11:02.42 --> 03:11:03.42 Okay.
03:11:03.42 --> 03:11:04.90 And if there's any more questions.
03:11:04.90 --> 03:11:05.90 I was thinking space grown.
03:11:05.90 --> 03:11:09.58 I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking, move base alpha.
03:11:09.58 --> 03:11:10.58 Yeah.
03:11:10.58 --> 03:11:13.74 And if you can indicate the benefits of anything moon grown, I'm sure that they would
03:11:13.74 --> 03:11:15.30 provide that on the website or whatever.
03:11:15.30 --> 03:11:16.30 That's what I get it for me.
03:11:16.30 --> 03:11:19.74 Anyway, alpha brain is proven as well.
03:11:19.74 --> 03:11:24.34 That's the thing with neutropics, neutropicic to the help of your brain.
03:11:24.34 --> 03:11:27.34 A lot of times people will be like, ah, that's a placebo thing.
03:11:27.34 --> 03:11:30.42 They went through the real test to prove that it works.
03:11:30.42 --> 03:11:34.06 Proven scientifically, fact that it's dope.
03:11:34.06 --> 03:11:38.78 Anyway, on a dot com slash jockel, get 10% off if you want 10% off.
03:11:38.78 --> 03:11:42.02 If you don't want 10% off, just go on a dot com.
03:11:42.02 --> 03:11:43.02 Pay full price.
03:11:43.02 --> 03:11:44.02 Boom.
03:11:44.02 --> 03:11:45.02 Support everybody.
03:11:45.02 --> 03:11:46.02 Everything.
03:11:46.02 --> 03:11:47.02 Actually, not supporting anybody.
03:11:47.02 --> 03:11:48.50 And you're definitely not supporting us.
03:11:48.50 --> 03:11:50.50 If you don't do that, let's go.
03:11:50.50 --> 03:11:56.02 Well, technically it is because it's like you're still getting your supplements.
03:11:56.02 --> 03:11:59.70 You know, you're still getting supplementation.
03:11:59.70 --> 03:12:00.70 We're just not getting the credit.
03:12:00.70 --> 03:12:06.54 So just like if like you donate to a cause and you put anonymous in the thing.
03:12:06.54 --> 03:12:08.34 And then you donate another 10% same thing.
03:12:08.34 --> 03:12:10.34 To him saying anyway.
03:12:10.34 --> 03:12:11.94 I'm going to just let this one go.
03:12:11.94 --> 03:12:12.94 That's a good way.
03:12:12.94 --> 03:12:15.98 Because I realize I'm guilty for making these things longer.
03:12:15.98 --> 03:12:16.98 Because I'm interjecting.
03:12:16.98 --> 03:12:17.98 I should just be quiet.
03:12:17.98 --> 03:12:18.98 Yes, just be quiet.
03:12:18.98 --> 03:12:21.98 Well, it's your podcast.
03:12:21.98 --> 03:12:22.98 So you say whatever you like right here.
03:12:22.98 --> 03:12:23.98 It's all our podcasts.
03:12:23.98 --> 03:12:24.98 Come on.
03:12:24.98 --> 03:12:28.58 So on it is one of the ways to support to wrap it up.
03:12:28.58 --> 03:12:31.98 On the dot com slash jockel, get 10% off.
03:12:31.98 --> 03:12:32.98 Help.

03:12:33.98 --> 03:12:34.98 Just trust me.
03:12:34.98 --> 03:12:35.98 They're good.
03:12:35.98 --> 03:12:38.98 Another good way.
03:12:38.98 --> 03:12:39.98 Christmas is almost here, man.
03:12:39.98 --> 03:12:40.98 It's like what?
03:12:40.98 --> 03:12:41.98 Four, three, four days.
03:12:41.98 --> 03:12:43.98 Something like that.
03:12:43.98 --> 03:12:44.98 Something like that.
03:12:44.98 --> 03:12:47.98 If you shop in Amazon, click through the website.
03:12:47.98 --> 03:12:49.98 That's a good way to support.
03:12:49.98 --> 03:12:54.98 Click through the website that's called jockelstore.com or call jockelpodcast.com.
03:12:54.98 --> 03:12:55.98 Yeah.
03:12:55.98 --> 03:12:56.98 Could it.
03:12:56.98 --> 03:12:57.98 That's the website.
03:12:57.98 --> 03:12:58.98 You got to click through.
03:12:58.98 --> 03:12:59.98 Correct.
03:12:59.98 --> 03:13:00.98 Yes.
03:13:00.98 --> 03:13:01.98 Jockelpodcast.com.
03:13:01.98 --> 03:13:03.98 Over on the side is Amazon little banner.
03:13:03.98 --> 03:13:07.98 Click on that one before you do your image like Amazon shopping for Christmas or whatever.
03:13:07.98 --> 03:13:09.98 Or buying any one of these books that the jockel talks about.
03:13:09.98 --> 03:13:13.98 On the jockel store, you got to go on the menu item support.
03:13:13.98 --> 03:13:14.98 And then I'll take you to the page with the bad.
03:13:14.98 --> 03:13:15.98 Yeah.
03:13:15.98 --> 03:13:20.98 Speaking of which podcast 100, as we talked about when Tim was on this podcast.
03:13:20.98 --> 03:13:21.98 Tim Ferris was on this podcast.
03:13:21.98 --> 03:13:27.98 We're going to do Musashi for podcast 100 because it's a big big big book.
03:13:27.98 --> 03:13:28.98 Correct.
03:13:28.98 --> 03:13:30.98 We need to get it on the podcast.
03:13:30.98 --> 03:13:32.98 So that will be on the website.
03:13:32.98 --> 03:13:34.98 So you can buy that book now because it's the thick book.
03:13:34.98 --> 03:13:36.98 And we're going to do it for podcast 100.
03:13:36.98 --> 03:13:37.98 Right.
03:13:37.98 --> 03:13:38.98 You can click through.
03:13:38.98 --> 03:13:42.98 The other thing is that's beneficial about these ways of supporting the podcast.
03:13:42.98 --> 03:13:45.98 No advertisements on the podcast.
03:13:45.98 --> 03:13:49.98 Except for this here, which I guess could be considered an advertisement.
03:13:49.98 --> 03:13:54.98 But I don't want to have the analpha commercial break.
03:13:54.98 --> 03:13:55.98 Yeah.
03:13:55.98 --> 03:13:56.98 We would like to present.
03:13:56.98 --> 03:13:57.98 Yeah.
03:13:57.98 --> 03:13:58.98 Don't.
03:13:58.98 --> 03:13:59.98 Something that doesn't matter.
03:13:59.98 --> 03:14:01.98 Are you tired of sleeping?
03:14:01.98 --> 03:14:02.98 Right.
03:14:02.98 --> 03:14:03.98 You know that kind of stuff.
03:14:03.98 --> 03:14:04.98 Yeah.
03:14:04.98 --> 03:14:05.98 So yeah.
03:14:05.98 --> 03:14:06.98 The Amazon clicked.
03:14:06.98 --> 03:14:07.98 That's a good one.
03:14:07.98 --> 03:14:08.98 That's like because it doesn't cost you nothing.
03:14:08.98 --> 03:14:09.98 It's like super easy.
03:14:09.98 --> 03:14:14.98 And it's like you're kind of just in the whole game of just, you know, reinforcements support.
03:14:14.98 --> 03:14:18.98 Amazon click through the website for you shopping.
03:14:18.98 --> 03:14:19.98 Boom.
03:14:19.98 --> 03:14:21.98 You can also subscribe to the podcast.
03:14:21.98 --> 03:14:23.98 And that seems obvious.
03:14:23.98 --> 03:14:28.98 But sometimes you know, back to this, you know, you talk about this sometimes.
03:14:28.98 --> 03:14:29.98 Amazon.
03:14:29.98 --> 03:14:32.98 So you can click through Amazon.
03:14:32.98 --> 03:14:33.98 Right.
03:14:33.98 --> 03:14:35.98 Let's say you're going to buy something that's not expensive.
03:14:35.98 --> 03:14:37.98 Like a bunch of pens.
03:14:37.98 --> 03:14:38.98 Sure.
03:14:38.98 --> 03:14:42.98 You might think, oh man, I'm just going to go directly to Amazon because that's no big deal.
03:14:42.98 --> 03:14:43.98 Right.
03:14:43.98 --> 03:14:45.98 We don't need to support the podcast on this purchase.
03:14:45.98 --> 03:14:46.98 Right.
03:14:46.98 --> 03:14:47.98 There's two problems with that.
03:14:47.98 --> 03:14:54.98 Number one, if no one bought their duct tape without clicking through, we wouldn't get any of the benefit of having the site there.
03:14:54.98 --> 03:14:56.98 The other thing is.
03:14:56.98 --> 03:15:00.98 You got to exercise daily discipline in all things.
03:15:00.98 --> 03:15:01.98 That doesn't.
03:15:01.98 --> 03:15:04.98 If you get my point is that if you get in the habit of doing it, then you'll be in the habit.
03:15:04.98 --> 03:15:07.98 Otherwise, if you only do it sometimes, then the time you go out and buy.
03:15:07.98 --> 03:15:09.98 A lawn mower.
03:15:09.98 --> 03:15:15.98 Then you know, or somebody bought a set of golf clubs and remember that guy, he says, I just bought some golf clubs.
03:15:15.98 --> 03:15:18.98 Like a $1,000 set of golf clubs clubs.
03:15:18.98 --> 03:15:19.98 He clicked through.
03:15:19.98 --> 03:15:21.98 You know, so that definitely supports the podcast.
03:15:21.98 --> 03:15:22.98 Yeah.
03:15:22.98 --> 03:15:25.98 But it's because he had the discipline, the the.
03:15:25.98 --> 03:15:27.98 Reen forced.
03:15:27.98 --> 03:15:29.98 Reiteration of doing it all the time.
03:15:29.98 --> 03:15:31.98 So it's doing it just do it all the time.
03:15:31.98 --> 03:15:32.98 That's my recommendation.
03:15:32.98 --> 03:15:33.98 Yeah.
03:15:33.98 --> 03:15:34.98 It is true man.
03:15:34.98 --> 03:15:37.98 That's kind of the key is like to remember to do it.
03:15:37.98 --> 03:15:39.98 And here's the and everyone's duct tape counts.
03:15:39.98 --> 03:15:40.98 Yeah.
03:15:40.98 --> 03:15:43.98 And the end here's the thing like you're under no obligation to do that.
03:15:43.98 --> 03:15:48.98 I'm just saying, most times you be like, hey, I want to support podcasts.
03:15:48.98 --> 03:15:51.98 It's cool because, you know.
03:15:51.98 --> 03:15:55.98 But at the time of, you know, hey, and you might duct tape, I go, I do it.
03:15:55.98 --> 03:15:58.98 I buy the duct tape and it's like, oh, I forgot.
03:15:58.98 --> 03:15:59.98 Yeah.
03:15:59.98 --> 03:16:01.98 You know, just to kind of avoid that kind of situation.
03:16:01.98 --> 03:16:04.98 If you have it in your mind, that's really the key is to remember to do it.
03:16:04.98 --> 03:16:06.98 Then you're living with the guilt.
03:16:06.98 --> 03:16:07.98 No man.
03:16:07.98 --> 03:16:09.98 Barely can go on.
03:16:09.98 --> 03:16:10.98 Anyway, yeah.
03:16:10.98 --> 03:16:15.98 So yeah, do that or subscribe to the podcast or and subscribe to the podcast.
03:16:15.98 --> 03:16:16.98 I should say.
03:16:16.98 --> 03:16:17.98 Yeah.
03:16:17.98 --> 03:16:18.98 It seems obvious on iTunes.
03:16:18.98 --> 03:16:19.98 You subscribe, but I don't know if you haven't already.
03:16:19.98 --> 03:16:20.98 Subscribe.
03:16:20.98 --> 03:16:22.98 That's a good way to support and leave a review.
03:16:22.98 --> 03:16:23.98 If.
03:16:23.98 --> 03:16:25.98 If you're compelled to.
03:16:25.98 --> 03:16:27.98 Those reviews are pretty dope.
03:16:27.98 --> 03:16:28.98 By the way.
03:16:28.98 --> 03:16:33.98 I'm subscribed on YouTube. We are along with the podcast and video format.
03:16:33.98 --> 03:16:35.98 We'll do some excerpts.
03:16:35.98 --> 03:16:39.98 Stuff you can share with people that they don't, they don't have to commit to three hours.
03:16:39.98 --> 03:16:43.98 And, you know, however long the case may be to listen to the whole podcast.
03:16:43.98 --> 03:16:48.98 And just listen to the, you know, three minute, one minute, five minute even, you know, things about.
03:16:48.98 --> 03:16:50.98 Whatever case maybe.
03:16:50.98 --> 03:16:52.98 But whatever little excerpts, you know.
03:16:52.98 --> 03:16:54.98 I think those are beneficial.
03:16:54.98 --> 03:16:55.98 I think.
03:16:55.98 --> 03:16:58.98 When people share that kind with me.
03:16:58.98 --> 03:17:01.98 I think you can learn a lot.
03:17:01.98 --> 03:17:02.98 Prischer.
03:17:02.98 --> 03:17:05.98 I think there's, you know, a lot to be said for it.
03:17:05.98 --> 03:17:06.98 But they're going to give you a.
03:17:06.98 --> 03:17:07.98 Or.
03:17:07.98 --> 03:17:09.98 We have a store.
03:17:09.98 --> 03:17:10.98 Jockel has a store.
03:17:10.98 --> 03:17:11.98 It's called.
03:17:11.98 --> 03:17:12.98 So now you say, I have a store.
03:17:12.98 --> 03:17:13.98 We have a store.
03:17:13.98 --> 03:17:14.98 Not my store.
03:17:14.98 --> 03:17:16.98 Yeah, but if I say,
03:17:16.98 --> 03:17:17.98 Jockel has a store.
03:17:17.98 --> 03:17:19.98 It's called Jockel store.
03:17:19.98 --> 03:17:20.98 Okay.
03:17:20.98 --> 03:17:21.98 Sounds kind of cooler.
03:17:21.98 --> 03:17:22.98 Okay.
03:17:22.98 --> 03:17:23.98 And original name too.
03:17:23.98 --> 03:17:24.98 Yeah.
03:17:24.98 --> 03:17:27.98 So I was trying to do that, but can you interrupt your, but that's cool.
03:17:27.98 --> 03:17:29.98 There's some cool shirts on there.
03:17:29.98 --> 03:17:30.98 Some layers on the shirts.
03:17:30.98 --> 03:17:32.98 I'm going to let you look.
03:17:32.98 --> 03:17:36.98 I'm going to let you see the layers on your own.
03:17:36.98 --> 03:17:38.98 So go to jockelstore.com.
03:17:38.98 --> 03:17:41.98 See if you can find the layers on the shirts.
03:17:41.98 --> 03:17:46.98 I'm not saying to buy a shirt or a tank top or a hoodie or a star.
03:17:46.98 --> 03:17:48.98 I'm not saying to buy one.
03:17:48.98 --> 03:17:51.98 But if you feel compelled to buy one because you think they're cool, the layers hit you.
03:17:51.98 --> 03:17:53.98 They resonate with you.
03:17:53.98 --> 03:17:55.98 I don't like the word resonates.
03:17:55.98 --> 03:17:56.98 Use it anyway.
03:17:56.98 --> 03:17:58.98 If they resonate, get a shirt.
03:17:58.98 --> 03:18:01.98 That's a good way to support.
03:18:01.98 --> 03:18:03.98 Some patches too.
03:18:03.98 --> 03:18:07.98 You know the ones that with the Velcro, the regulation.

03:18:11.98 --> 03:18:14.98 We have a lot of military and law enforcement that wanted.
03:18:14.98 --> 03:18:15.98 Yeah.
03:18:15.98 --> 03:18:16.98 Regulation size.
03:18:16.98 --> 03:18:17.98 Yeah.
03:18:17.98 --> 03:18:18.98 Second one.
03:18:18.98 --> 03:18:19.98 In the field.
03:18:19.98 --> 03:18:19.98 Yeah.
03:18:19.98 --> 03:18:21.98 As they're crushing evil in the world.
03:18:21.98 --> 03:18:22.98 Yeah.
03:18:22.98 --> 03:18:23.98 They're on there too.
03:18:23.98 --> 03:18:25.98 And whatever else, you think it's cool.
03:18:25.98 --> 03:18:26.98 I'm going to redo the mugs.
03:18:26.98 --> 03:18:29.98 They're going to be like a special like one.
03:18:29.98 --> 03:18:31.98 Like a super high quality one.
03:18:31.98 --> 03:18:32.98 The travel mugs.
03:18:32.98 --> 03:18:33.98 Yeah.
03:18:33.98 --> 03:18:34.98 And then yeah.
03:18:34.98 --> 03:18:35.98 There you go.
03:18:35.98 --> 03:18:38.98 And then a psychological warfare.
03:18:38.98 --> 03:18:39.98 See that was a done.
03:18:39.98 --> 03:18:40.98 That turned out good.
03:18:40.98 --> 03:18:41.98 It did.
03:18:41.98 --> 03:18:42.98 I'm going to tell you that.
03:18:42.98 --> 03:18:46.98 I was listening to your explanation of what psychological warfare was.
03:18:46.98 --> 03:18:47.98 You need to listen to it.
03:18:47.98 --> 03:18:49.98 It is unclear.
03:18:49.98 --> 03:18:50.98 You told the story.
03:18:50.98 --> 03:18:53.98 But it was like, you know how we're talking to each other right now.
03:18:53.98 --> 03:18:54.98 Yeah.
03:18:54.98 --> 03:18:55.98 And you were telling you, kind of telling me the story.
03:18:55.98 --> 03:18:56.98 Right.
03:18:56.98 --> 03:18:57.98 But I know a bunch about it.
03:18:57.98 --> 03:18:58.98 Yeah.
03:18:58.98 --> 03:18:59.98 So when I listened to it, I said, you know what?
03:18:59.98 --> 03:19:01.98 People that aren't that don't know what this is.
03:19:01.98 --> 03:19:03.98 Are going to wonder what this is.
03:19:03.98 --> 03:19:09.98 Echo ask me some questions about what I'm thinking about in certain situations of weaknesses.
03:19:09.98 --> 03:19:10.98 Right.
03:19:10.98 --> 03:19:12.98 Certain situations of weaknesses.
03:19:12.98 --> 03:19:13.98 And he asked me a couple of minutes.
03:19:13.98 --> 03:19:15.98 And I kind of told him, like, off the cuff.
03:19:15.98 --> 03:19:17.98 Oh, I think about this and this.
03:19:17.98 --> 03:19:19.98 And he's kind of got that looking as face when I know he's.
03:19:19.98 --> 03:19:21.98 I know he's thinking of something.
03:19:21.98 --> 03:19:23.98 So I said, oh, he's thinking of something.
03:19:23.98 --> 03:19:27.98 And then the next day, you know, hey, we got to do record these.
03:19:27.98 --> 03:19:31.98 So he, we came up with some more questions that Echo is like, oh, this is a good one.
03:19:31.98 --> 03:19:32.98 This is a good one.
03:19:32.98 --> 03:19:33.98 Came up with the questions.
03:19:33.98 --> 03:19:39.98 And then I wrote down the answers and I read him into a microphone.
03:19:39.98 --> 03:19:42.98 We recorded it because that's what Echo does.
03:19:42.98 --> 03:19:48.98 And then he said, hey, I'm going to make this into because people ask for ring tones.
03:19:48.98 --> 03:19:53.98 They want to be able to awake to, because they want to feel the wake to me.
03:19:53.98 --> 03:19:55.98 A lot of rocks to stuff.
03:19:55.98 --> 03:20:00.98 So he said, I'm going to put these on iTunes and put them for sale.
03:20:00.98 --> 03:20:02.98 And I said, oh, well, if that's what you think.
03:20:02.98 --> 03:20:07.98 So he, the album is called, so it's an album of clips.
03:20:07.98 --> 03:20:09.98 They're like two or three minutes long.
03:20:09.98 --> 03:20:12.98 They're from there for a cup.
03:20:12.98 --> 03:20:15.98 They're for psychological warfare against moments of weakness.
03:20:15.98 --> 03:20:16.98 Yes.
03:20:16.98 --> 03:20:19.98 And we're in the most one with a weakness come when you want to get up in the morning.
03:20:19.98 --> 03:20:23.98 So there's, there's actually, because I know that's a hard one for people.
03:20:23.98 --> 03:20:28.98 There's three psychological attacks against the weakness of not getting out of bed in the morning.
03:20:28.98 --> 03:20:31.98 There's psychological warfare against wanted to eat bad food.
03:20:31.98 --> 03:20:34.98 There's psychological warfare against procrastination.
03:20:34.98 --> 03:20:39.98 Just moments of weakness are covered in the psychological warfare album.
03:20:39.98 --> 03:20:40.98 Very well covered.
03:20:40.98 --> 03:20:42.98 And it's for sale in iTunes.
03:20:42.98 --> 03:20:47.98 And you've got a search for juggle willing or psychological warfare.
03:20:47.98 --> 03:20:52.98 It's a little bit hard to find because of the way iTunes is laid out because it's in spoken word.
03:20:52.98 --> 03:20:54.98 But that doesn't drop down under music anyways.
03:20:54.98 --> 03:20:55.98 It's kind of hard to find.
03:20:55.98 --> 03:20:57.98 But it is on there.
03:20:57.98 --> 03:21:02.98 And that is, in fact, another way to support the podcast because it is for sale.
03:21:02.98 --> 03:21:04.98 Because people want to support the podcast.
03:21:04.98 --> 03:21:08.98 And so they say, hey, how can we support the podcast?
03:21:08.98 --> 03:21:12.98 And you know, we used to say people say, oh, do you have this thing where you can donate money?
03:21:12.98 --> 03:21:13.98 We'll just give you money.
03:21:13.98 --> 03:21:15.98 Oh, I don't want you just to give me money.
03:21:15.98 --> 03:21:17.98 I want to give you something.
03:21:17.98 --> 03:21:18.98 If you, you just don't give me money.
03:21:18.98 --> 03:21:20.98 I'm not going to take it.
03:21:20.98 --> 03:21:23.98 Well, well, there's been a public couple of people that have given money, which is awesome.
03:21:23.98 --> 03:21:24.98 We appreciate it.
03:21:24.98 --> 03:21:29.98 But for the general, for my general conscience, right?
03:21:29.98 --> 03:21:31.98 Recipercation.
03:21:31.98 --> 03:21:32.98 Want to give you something back.
03:21:32.98 --> 03:21:33.98 So here's what we give you.
03:21:33.98 --> 03:21:37.98 You give us money for the iTunes album.
03:21:37.98 --> 03:21:38.98 You get something back.
03:21:38.98 --> 03:21:42.98 And you know what you get back discipline in MP3 format.
03:21:42.98 --> 03:21:43.98 That's what you get.
03:21:43.98 --> 03:21:44.98 So check it out.
03:21:44.98 --> 03:21:45.98 They're pretty, they're funny.
03:21:45.98 --> 03:21:48.98 They're no screaming, but they're getting after it.
03:21:48.98 --> 03:21:49.98 And the feedback that I've gotten is awesome.
03:21:49.98 --> 03:21:50.98 Like everyone comes to it or so.
03:21:50.98 --> 03:21:52.98 They're like, yeah, I've been out a bit every time.
03:21:52.98 --> 03:21:53.98 Yeah.
03:21:53.98 --> 03:21:56.98 I, I over, you know, I didn't procrastinate on this project.
03:21:56.98 --> 03:21:57.98 I'm going to do that.
03:21:57.98 --> 03:22:01.98 Debbie said, I got this project done a week early because I didn't want to procrastinate.
03:22:01.98 --> 03:22:04.98 You know, but two side notes to that one.
03:22:04.98 --> 03:22:09.98 So if you're going to do the alarm clock thing, this is the last time.
03:22:09.98 --> 03:22:13.98 Clear it with your, whoever you're sleeping with your wife or whatever.
03:22:13.98 --> 03:22:17.98 Just make sure they have the heads up because if they hear it, they're going to flip out.
03:22:17.98 --> 03:22:19.98 Yeah, and they won't flip out because I'm going crazy.
03:22:19.98 --> 03:22:22.98 They'll flip out because all of a sudden there's a man in the real talking.
03:22:22.98 --> 03:22:23.98 Yeah.
03:22:23.98 --> 03:22:24.98 That's enough to freak so bad.
03:22:24.98 --> 03:22:25.98 Okay.
03:22:25.98 --> 03:22:26.98 You got, you know, one.
03:22:26.98 --> 03:22:27.98 Yeah.
03:22:27.98 --> 03:22:28.98 Yeah.
03:22:28.98 --> 03:22:29.98 It's a kind of go over it.
03:22:29.98 --> 03:22:30.98 You know, go over the plan.
03:22:30.98 --> 03:22:31.98 You don't want to freak people out.
03:22:31.98 --> 03:22:32.98 Yeah.
03:22:32.98 --> 03:22:34.98 You're significant other were reaching for their side arm.
03:22:34.98 --> 03:22:35.98 Yeah.
03:22:35.98 --> 03:22:36.98 You don't know.
03:22:36.98 --> 03:22:38.98 Put in laser on around the room searching.
03:22:38.98 --> 03:22:40.98 And a second side note.
03:22:40.98 --> 03:22:43.98 Good feedback for sure.
03:22:43.98 --> 03:22:46.98 But it's been, I look at the stats sometimes.
03:22:46.98 --> 03:22:48.98 It's been number one.
03:22:48.98 --> 03:22:51.98 And spoken word category on iTunes.
03:22:51.98 --> 03:22:52.98 Number one.
03:22:52.98 --> 03:22:53.98 That's pretty good.
03:22:53.98 --> 03:22:56.98 There's some other good people on that list, but it's been number one.
03:22:56.98 --> 03:22:57.98 That's awesome.
03:22:57.98 --> 03:22:59.98 I think since I put, we put it on there.
03:22:59.98 --> 03:23:03.98 Anyway, well, thank you everyone. Yeah, everyone that's picking that up.
03:23:03.98 --> 03:23:04.98 Thank you.
03:23:04.98 --> 03:23:05.98 Appreciate that.
03:23:05.98 --> 03:23:06.98 It's awesome.
03:23:06.98 --> 03:23:09.98 But yeah, those are, yeah, solid ways to support.
03:23:09.98 --> 03:23:15.98 Couple other ways that you can support this one is you can get some juggle white tea.
03:23:15.98 --> 03:23:16.98 It's probably great.
03:23:16.98 --> 03:23:17.98 It's probably great.
03:23:17.98 --> 03:23:18.98 It's probably great.
03:23:18.98 --> 03:23:19.98 It's great.
03:23:19.98 --> 03:23:20.98 Can get some of that stuff.
03:23:20.98 --> 03:23:24.98 If you haven't gotten it and you think I don't like tea.
03:23:24.98 --> 03:23:26.98 You're wrong.
03:23:26.98 --> 03:23:31.98 Because you haven't tried this tea because it tastes, it doesn't taste, I'm telling you, it doesn't taste.
03:23:31.98 --> 03:23:32.98 I don't know what it tastes like.
03:23:32.98 --> 03:23:33.98 You know what it tastes like?
03:23:33.98 --> 03:23:34.98 It tastes like what it tastes like.
03:23:34.98 --> 03:23:36.98 There's nothing else that you compare to.
03:23:36.98 --> 03:23:38.98 It just tastes good, really good.
03:23:38.98 --> 03:23:41.98 And it's got a little bit of caffeine in it.
03:23:41.98 --> 03:23:44.98 You can actually drink it before you go to bed if you need to.
03:23:44.98 --> 03:23:45.98 You won't, and won't keep you up.
03:23:45.98 --> 03:23:47.98 It's not that kind of caffeine.
03:23:47.98 --> 03:23:48.98 It's different kinds of things.
03:23:48.98 --> 03:23:50.98 It's earth-grown caffeine.
03:23:50.98 --> 03:23:54.98 It's kind of caffeine that there's not a lot in there.
03:23:54.98 --> 03:23:56.98 It's got antioxidants in there.
03:23:56.98 --> 03:23:57.98 And it tastes really good.
03:23:57.98 --> 03:24:03.98 And you can have it pre-work out post-work out pre-meal, post-meal, pre-bed after bed during bed.
03:24:03.98 --> 03:24:05.98 You can get it out of it whenever you want.
03:24:05.98 --> 03:24:07.98 So that's the chocolate white tea.
03:24:07.98 --> 03:24:08.98 You can get that.
03:24:08.98 --> 03:24:10.98 And by the way, it's now been in stock.
03:24:10.98 --> 03:24:13.98 I'm going on like three or four or five days.
03:24:13.98 --> 03:24:14.98 It's in stock now.
03:24:14.98 --> 03:24:15.98 We've got a better system.
03:24:15.98 --> 03:24:16.98 We might have another fay.
03:24:16.98 --> 03:24:18.98 And I got some stuff on the horizon.
03:24:18.98 --> 03:24:20.98 There might be a little dip in the system.
03:24:20.98 --> 03:24:23.98 But it's in stock in the tin.
03:24:23.98 --> 03:24:25.98 The luxurious tin?

03:24:30.98 --> 03:24:31.98 But reload.
03:24:31.98 --> 03:24:32.98 Reload.
03:24:32.98 --> 03:24:33.98 And then you can get a mug.
03:24:33.98 --> 03:24:34.98 You can get a mug, by the way.
03:24:34.98 --> 03:24:35.98 The mug.
03:24:35.98 --> 03:24:37.98 It'll tell you what to do.
03:24:37.98 --> 03:24:38.98 It'll tell you what to do.
03:24:38.98 --> 03:24:39.98 Every single time.
03:24:39.98 --> 03:24:40.98 They won't tell you to do.
03:24:40.98 --> 03:24:41.98 It's good after it.
03:24:41.98 --> 03:24:44.98 To get that mug on their chocolate proved.
03:24:44.98 --> 03:24:46.98 And then extreme ownership.
03:24:46.98 --> 03:24:47.98 The book, Christmas.
03:24:47.98 --> 03:24:51.98 Why not get it for every single person you've ever known in your life?
03:24:51.98 --> 03:24:52.98 You might as well.
03:24:52.98 --> 03:24:53.98 No.
03:24:53.98 --> 03:24:54.98 Extreme ownership.
03:24:54.98 --> 03:24:59.98 If you listen to the podcast and kind of like what we talk about here, the book, extreme ownership.
03:24:59.98 --> 03:25:00.98 It's about the same thing.
03:25:00.98 --> 03:25:02.98 It's about combat leadership.
03:25:02.98 --> 03:25:04.98 Also speaking of extreme ownership.
03:25:04.98 --> 03:25:10.98 Again, New York City may fourth and fifth.

03:25:22.98 --> 03:25:26.98 We're going deep on combat leadership.
03:25:26.98 --> 03:25:31.98 Which means we're going deep on all leadership because the principles do not change.
03:25:31.98 --> 03:25:32.98 That's cool.

03:26:41.98 --> 03:26:45.98 Extremeownership.com, real original.
03:26:45.98 --> 03:26:46.98 We thought of that one.
03:26:46.98 --> 03:26:51.98 And we look forward to seeing you guys there in the meantime.
03:26:51.98 --> 03:26:55.98 If you want to kind of kick it with us,
03:26:55.98 --> 03:27:01.98 we are kicking it ourselves on the interwebs on Twitter,
03:27:01.98 --> 03:27:04.98 on Instagram as well.
03:27:04.98 --> 03:27:06.98 And also we're going to be on that one.
03:27:06.98 --> 03:27:07.98 That face book.
03:27:07.98 --> 03:27:11.98 We're going to be there.
03:27:11.98 --> 03:27:18.98 Echo is at echel Charles and I am at Jocquillic.
03:27:18.98 --> 03:27:22.98 And finally,
03:27:22.98 --> 03:27:26.98 go out there and execute.
03:27:26.98 --> 03:27:30.98 And we talk a lot about a lot of different subjects on this podcast.
03:27:30.98 --> 03:27:34.98 And we hear from incredible leaders and the lessons that we learned today.
03:27:34.98 --> 03:27:41.98 Lessons that were learned and lessons that are written in blood.
03:27:41.98 --> 03:27:45.98 But those lessons are meaningless.
03:27:45.98 --> 03:27:50.98 They're meaningless if you don't execute on them.
03:27:50.98 --> 03:27:53.98 If you listen without doing,
03:27:53.98 --> 03:27:56.98 you might as well not even waste your time.
03:27:56.98 --> 03:27:58.98 Just keep being arrogant,
03:27:58.98 --> 03:28:00.98 wasting your time not being productive,
03:28:00.98 --> 03:28:03.98 and not living up to your potential.
03:28:03.98 --> 03:28:13.98 Just keep wasting your life if you're not going to execute on what we learned.
03:28:13.98 --> 03:28:16.98 But if you listen,
03:28:16.98 --> 03:28:19.98 and then you go and you do,
03:28:19.98 --> 03:28:21.98 then stay on it.
03:28:21.98 --> 03:28:25.98 And remember also that the rewards don't come easy.
03:28:25.98 --> 03:28:30.98 Don't count on any glory.
03:28:30.98 --> 03:28:40.98 Just hold the line and stay on the path so that you know.
03:28:40.98 --> 03:28:49.98 So that you know that you are in the game 100%.
03:28:49.98 --> 03:28:58.98 And that you know that you are getting after it.
03:28:58.98 --> 03:29:01.98 So until next time,
03:29:01.98 --> 03:29:05.98 this is echo and juggle.
03:29:05.98 --> 03:29:32.98 Out.
