00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56 This is Jocco podcast number 46 with echo Charles and me,
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:11.28 Jocco Willick. Good evening echo. Good evening.
00:00:14.80 --> 00:00:20.88 There is a little survival instinct.
00:00:22.16 --> 00:00:25.36 It's very subtle.
00:00:25.36 --> 00:00:33.36 But I would notice it sometimes in a combat situation.
00:00:34.96 --> 00:00:44.16 When guys are thinking that enemy fire at any time could open up and kill them,
00:00:44.16 --> 00:00:48.96 you'd see some guys subconsciously.
00:00:48.96 --> 00:00:54.56 They just, they just try and make themselves a little bit of a smaller target.
00:00:54.56 --> 00:01:02.56 They just kind of slouch their backs down a little bit and they just kind of bow their head just a tad.
00:01:04.16 --> 00:01:06.56 It's not a bad thing to do.
00:01:06.56 --> 00:01:12.16 I don't think guys actually think about it. I don't think they consciously do it.
00:01:12.16 --> 00:01:14.56 I think it just kind of happens.
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:20.56 It can happen when you think you could get shot at any moment.
00:01:20.56 --> 00:01:27.76 It's likely a good instinct to have.
00:01:30.72 --> 00:01:38.48 And when we first got to Ramadi, we were out on patrol and I saw one of my guys
00:01:39.28 --> 00:01:44.56 on a real patrol. My first time seeing this particular guy on a real patrol.
00:01:44.56 --> 00:01:53.52 And it was in the Malab district of Ramadi, which was just an enemy controlled,
00:01:53.52 --> 00:02:00.56 cesspool of violence with threats everywhere.
00:02:00.56 --> 00:02:10.000 And as I saw this guy, he was standing straight up.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.32 Just standing straight up as head was held high.
00:02:14.32 --> 00:02:18.48 As a weapon was at the ready, he was scanning.
00:02:20.64 --> 00:02:21.44 He was hunting.
00:02:23.20 --> 00:02:30.000 There was no slouching his back. There was no lowering of his head. There was no fear
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.80 a parent on his face or in his posture. He was just boldly facing the threat.
00:02:36.80 --> 00:02:40.56 Standing tall.
00:02:44.96 --> 00:02:52.08 Now you've heard me talk about some of my guys in tasking at Bruser
00:02:54.08 --> 00:02:54.96 that I worried about.
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:05.12 I just some of the guys that I thought that they basically had too much courage,
00:03:05.12 --> 00:03:11.68 too much bravery. And it just didn't seem like that kind of attitude
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:23.20 was survivable day after day after day after bloody day in Ramadi.
00:03:23.20 --> 00:03:38.16 But somehow some way through some divine providence, this particular brave soul did survive,
00:03:38.16 --> 00:03:46.80 and actually thrived in that environment, in the battle of Ramadi with tasking at Bruser.
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:53.92 Now tasking at Bruser was made up of two seal potoons, Charlie Potoon and Delta Potoon.
00:03:54.56 --> 00:03:56.40 Charlie Potoon we've talked about before.
00:03:57.92 --> 00:04:02.16 Lave Fabon was the Potoon commander, Tony Afradi, who's been on the podcast.
00:04:03.20 --> 00:04:10.96 BTF Tony, he was the Potoon chief and the lead sniper for Charlie Potoon was Chris Kyle.
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:20.48 And in the other Potoon, Delta Potoon, where Andrew Paul, who's also been on the podcast,
00:04:21.52 --> 00:04:30.32 he was the assistant Potoon commander and the point man and sniper, the lead point man and lead
00:04:30.32 --> 00:04:39.28 sniper for Delta Potoon was that guy was the guy that I just described walking through the literal
00:04:39.28 --> 00:04:46.16 valley of death with his head held high.
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:59.60 And his name is Jeremiah De Nell, also known as JP De Nell. That's what I always called him.
00:05:01.20 --> 00:05:05.92 And we have him as a guest on the podcast tonight. Now,
00:05:05.92 --> 00:05:15.04 when JP was in tasking at Bruser, he was a kid. When we were in work up, I think he was 22 years old.
00:05:16.24 --> 00:05:25.68 When we deployed he was 23 years old and I love JP. He was like a brother and to be quite honest,
00:05:25.68 --> 00:05:33.60 really he's like a little brother to me. And I loved his aggressiveness and when we were going through
00:05:33.60 --> 00:05:38.80 work up, he would just just straight up execute anything I told him to do. Anything.
00:05:40.32 --> 00:05:46.000 Like a like a hyper aggressive Terminator robot. I would look at him and say, JP take that room or
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.64 JP get on that high ground or JP get those prisoners out of here and he would just get after it
00:05:50.64 --> 00:05:54.72 and make it happen and just destroy or outmaneuver anything that was in his way.
00:05:57.36 --> 00:06:03.12 One time we were going through Mount Training, which is urban warfare. So we're in a kind of
00:06:03.12 --> 00:06:08.16 fake city with buildings and all this and there was a building across the street and we were taking
00:06:08.16 --> 00:06:12.64 massive paintball fire again. It's just training but we're getting shot up with paintball.
00:06:14.08 --> 00:06:17.20 And in my mind I'm thinking, okay, where if this is real we're getting killed.
00:06:18.48 --> 00:06:22.40 And I know that we need to get aggressive to stop this and say, I'm kind of give the command of,
00:06:22.40 --> 00:06:25.92 hey, we need to hit that building across the street and it like as the last word is coming out of
00:06:25.92 --> 00:06:29.12 my mouth. I see JP just bust out of the door the building we're in.
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:36.32 Just go running across the street with his gun blazing. Just caveman smashed through the door
00:06:36.32 --> 00:06:42.000 of the target building. Do you go in there and I just see muzzle flashes. He's just machine gunning people.
00:06:43.84 --> 00:06:53.68 And I thought to myself, okay, JP can bring it at least he can bring it during training
00:06:53.68 --> 00:07:03.60 because courage against paintball in training is actually not that big of a deal at all. In fact,
00:07:03.60 --> 00:07:07.84 it's borderline meaningless but it is an indication.
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:15.28 Now courage in sustained combat is another thing.
00:07:15.28 --> 00:07:26.000 And JP proved himself as a true warrior over and over and over again during the battle
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:35.20 of Ramadi. And I'm honored to have my brother JP to know on the podcast today.
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:48.56 JP, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me here. And we have to start with trying to understand
00:07:50.08 --> 00:07:58.32 where you come from. How much time do we have? Where you grew up and in all that.
00:07:58.32 --> 00:08:06.40 And it's pretty cool. I know your mom and dad and I've actually grappled against your dad.
00:08:08.08 --> 00:08:13.36 20 of his highlights. He loves that. He talks about it all the time. He has a long, strong,
00:08:13.36 --> 00:08:24.80 man, scary strong. Yeah. Like, and how old is he now? He is 54, 55. No kidding. Yeah.
00:08:24.80 --> 00:08:29.68 So 10 years ago, he was my age. Yeah. So when I grappled with him, he was my age. Yeah.
00:08:29.68 --> 00:08:35.04 And I thought he was all old. No. And right now, if you called me old, I'd be pissed. Yeah, I know you would be.
00:08:35.04 --> 00:08:39.28 So Mr. Vanilla, I apologize. I thought you were old back in the day. No. He grabbed the
00:08:39.28 --> 00:08:45.12 hold of my head and you were a must. I am right now. Oh, that's crazy, isn't it? Yeah. Sorry.
00:08:45.12 --> 00:08:52.08 Yeah, no, that's true. So tell us about where you come from. What was like growing up?
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:57.76 All that stuff. How did my parents are awesome? Very hard workers.
00:08:59.44 --> 00:09:06.16 You grew up tied on money. My dad did construction and framing in the 80s and my mom taught
00:09:06.16 --> 00:09:14.80 step aerobics not a lot of money there. But they constantly worked for our family. It was awesome.
00:09:14.80 --> 00:09:20.56 Now we, every Sunday we were at church, you know, not having a lot of money. You go out and do stuff.
00:09:20.56 --> 00:09:25.76 We'd go for, for drives. You know, that's what we did. Our family would go for drives. And just go,
00:09:25.76 --> 00:09:29.76 you know, see the, you know, we're in Northern California, Sacramento within 20 minutes.
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:33.44 He can be in the foot hills and it's just beautiful. We go to my grandparents' property.
00:09:34.72 --> 00:09:39.76 You know, my dad's parents were a very big part of our life as well. Growing up,
00:09:39.76 --> 00:09:46.000 grandfather's old world, or two of that was on the destroyer. On a destroyer, my grandmother's
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.28 amazing woman, you know, wakes up every morning, still at 5 a.m. to pray for everybody in the family.
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:56.56 They have five acres up in the foot hills, the pasture, the horses. So for kids, there's awesome.
00:09:58.48 --> 00:10:03.52 You know, brother and sister. My parents, you know, they didn't wait for having kids, you know,
00:10:03.52 --> 00:10:09.04 I had me and then, you know, I think it was like 15 or now 17 months later. My brother comes
00:10:09.04 --> 00:10:14.16 then 17 months later, I thought my sister comes. So, you know, our dad and you know, I've
00:10:14.16 --> 00:10:19.52 kept the rich twins. They call that. Yeah. It was like boom, boom, boom.
00:10:20.72 --> 00:10:25.44 Yeah, awesome. You know, my brother and my sister, like two of my closest best friends, still, you know,
00:10:26.96 --> 00:10:32.08 we just always used to grow up playing Navy Seals, you know, and, you know, where'd you get
00:10:32.08 --> 00:10:38.80 okay, so going into the next question, which, which I am always curious is, how did you hear about
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:47.12 the teams? Actually, my brother saw something on TV. There's some special about the forming of the
00:10:47.12 --> 00:10:53.12 seals and the, you know, JFK's speech and all this stuff, and he had my parents record it.
00:10:53.12 --> 00:10:59.92 And we would watch that every morning that we could, you know, we're young, you know, trying to
00:10:59.92 --> 00:11:05.36 go to school with my brother's popnet and the VCR. And so every weekend, we definitely watched it,
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:10.64 and then we would, you know, dress up in camis and pan our faces and stuff that we got from
00:11:10.64 --> 00:11:16.88 old Army Navy surplus store or just from garage sales and we would go play Navy Seals, you know,
00:11:16.88 --> 00:11:22.24 and we got to my grandparents as like a haven, you know, and it's funny. Now, like, I didn't know
00:11:22.24 --> 00:11:28.40 what I was doing, but I used to like do make up little guilly suits. And I would have my parents
00:11:28.40 --> 00:11:32.96 dropped me off at the front entrance of my grandparents property. I'd wait until I got up to the
00:11:32.96 --> 00:11:36.56 house and I'd say, hey, I want, I want to see if you can see me sneaking up there. I would try to
00:11:36.56 --> 00:11:43.76 stock up to my grandparents house. You're training this. I mean, yeah. And yeah, so that, you know,
00:11:43.76 --> 00:11:47.52 it was a really good life. You know, all my, all my aunts and uncles and cousins, you know,
00:11:47.52 --> 00:11:54.000 we're all really close and just really close family, you know, my uncle, my cousin's uncles,
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.60 he was a cop, back where we grew up and, you know, he's still serving the community. He's a
00:11:59.60 --> 00:12:05.28 legit badass. And, you know, so I was surrounded by a lot of good people that didn't know anything
00:12:05.28 --> 00:12:10.88 other than working hard. Like you just have to work hard. There's no excuses for that. There's no handouts,
00:12:10.88 --> 00:12:16.56 like you've just got to get after it. And that's just kind of how I learned about the teams. And,
00:12:16.56 --> 00:12:20.56 you know, as you get older in high school, you kind of forget about that stuff. But yeah, it was
00:12:20.56 --> 00:12:25.28 pretty good solid based. Great life. Did you win list right out of high school? Yeah. Yeah, I was in,
00:12:25.28 --> 00:12:30.72 um, missing year of high school. Uh, weren't you breaking leg or have some weirds?
00:12:30.72 --> 00:12:36.000 I had my, I broke my hand. Broken hand. Yeah, so my hand was in a cast. How'd you do that?
00:12:37.28 --> 00:12:43.76 Well, I had to get to get to the best thing that you do. You sold this story of this kind of, uh,
00:12:44.96 --> 00:12:51.04 you know, picture perfect childhood with all this goodness around you. But just,
00:12:51.04 --> 00:12:55.60 I'll just going to straight up tell people. JP might crack a few people once in a while if they
00:12:55.60 --> 00:13:00.64 need it. What he was a young kid. Yeah. Definitely definitely never went out looking for it and
00:13:00.64 --> 00:13:06.000 starting it. But if it was there, I, you know, like, anyways, we're at a party with my buddies. And,
00:13:07.20 --> 00:13:10.16 no, actually, we're just like kind of hanging out the house and, I don't know,
00:13:10.16 --> 00:13:15.20 I happen some guys like show it up the orange. Anyway, it's gotten a fight, broke my hand. Um,
00:13:15.20 --> 00:13:20.08 don't, you know, like a smart young man. Don't go to the hospital that night. My hands like
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:25.12 ballooning up. Well, you know, the next day we're going to go whitewater rafting. So I mean,
00:13:25.12 --> 00:13:30.000 I can't not do that with all my friends. So I just put my hand in the river the whole time.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.84 Because I'm like, that's like ice right? I get home. I thought my mom was going to just beat me.
00:13:35.84 --> 00:13:41.28 She's a short little, just thin athletic woman. And I was just like terrified of the
00:13:41.28 --> 00:13:46.000 fridge. She's going to do some step aerobics on your head. Yes. Exactly. She was going to get after it.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.48 Um, and so I go, you know, so she's like, yeah, we're going to the hospital. So we go there and they're like,
00:13:52.48 --> 00:13:59.20 yeah, you broke her knuckle, this bone, and fractured the wrist. I'm like, okay. So I get in a cast.
00:13:59.20 --> 00:14:05.20 Of course, my dad's pissed off, you know, and, um, he's just like, you know, just,
00:14:05.20 --> 00:14:09.44 he's my senior year. I'm getting close to graduation. And there was no talk of college.
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:15.44 I played water polo. My senior year in one of the J.C.s or my coach at, hey,
00:14:15.44 --> 00:14:20.32 you know, if you go to this J.C., you see Davis, you know, you could be going over and playing over there.
00:14:20.32 --> 00:14:25.52 I just knew college wasn't what I wanted to do. At the time, it just wasn't for me. I wasn't going to waste time
00:14:25.52 --> 00:14:31.92 more money doing something I just wasn't driven to do. And, um, you know, my dad's like, what are you going to do?
00:14:31.92 --> 00:14:35.36 What are you going to do with your life? And I was like, I don't know, probably be a white water rafting guy
00:14:35.36 --> 00:14:39.92 and live up up in the mountains. He's like, what are you going to do with your life? You're like,
00:14:39.92 --> 00:14:46.08 not there on with that, but you know, he's like, no, like, you're, no. And, uh, because one of my best friends
00:14:46.08 --> 00:14:51.36 did that, and, uh, which is just cool, which is a lifestyle, but it seems cool, yeah, it would be great for the
00:14:51.36 --> 00:14:56.88 soul, right? And, um, so anyways, my dad was like, what about the military? Like, what about being a Navy
00:14:56.88 --> 00:15:02.16 seal? You always talk about it. And, at the time, all I could think about was just like the regular
00:15:02.16 --> 00:15:06.40 fleet Navy recruiters that would come to high school. And this was pre 9-11, so nobody's really
00:15:06.40 --> 00:15:10.72 very motivated. And, you know, they, they would come to the high school, but they never really
00:15:10.72 --> 00:15:16.48 engaged with the students or anything. So I was like, uh, that's the Navy. I don't know.
00:15:17.92 --> 00:15:23.68 I'll go to work that next day, and because I'm in a cast, I had me at the front register.
00:15:23.68 --> 00:15:28.96 And for the first time ever, I noticed across the street is a Navy recruiting office.
00:15:28.96 --> 00:15:31.84 I was like, oh, I'll go in there. So I went in there and of course, I was like, oh, what are you
00:15:31.84 --> 00:15:35.04 going to do with a while? What are you here for? I was like, I was thinking about joining the Navy,
00:15:35.04 --> 00:15:41.28 you want to be a Navy seal? They all start laughing. I was like, check. I would pass. Like, I was like,
00:15:41.28 --> 00:15:47.28 real mad. I thought, well, you know, all the seal wannabes have to talk to pedda after so and so.
00:15:47.28 --> 00:15:52.32 And, yeah, do you mean you said the seal wannabes? I was fired up. And then you guys,
00:15:52.32 --> 00:15:56.64 and we can't do anything with your cast on. Am I right? Roger that. They're like, you know, if you
00:15:56.64 --> 00:16:00.72 want to come talk to them, he'll be on Thursday, he'll be on Tuesday. He'll be on Tuesday.
00:16:00.72 --> 00:16:06.08 Okay. So I go, go back to work. I'm just staring at the Navy recruiting office a whole time. Just
00:16:06.08 --> 00:16:12.96 just doing. So I'm like, I'm in good shape. You know, like I'm very good athlete. Like, I can do this.
00:16:12.96 --> 00:16:19.52 Go back home and tell my dad my dad's okay. How's work? I'm like, good. I was like, I'm joined the Navy.
00:16:19.52 --> 00:16:24.000 And I can't go do anything for boot camp with this cast on. Like, I don't know, like, you know,
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.24 my mind, I'm like, I'm leaving for boot camp tomorrow. So I'm like that, right? And so he's like,
00:16:28.24 --> 00:16:31.92 cool, go start the bathtub. Start soaking it. I'll get some tools out of the garage.
00:16:31.92 --> 00:16:38.16 And so my dad comes in there and he has like some like sheet metal shears and something
00:16:38.16 --> 00:16:44.32 out, a saws off. Yeah. And we just got out there and we cut off my cast. Dude, I thought my mom
00:16:44.32 --> 00:16:49.20 was going to beat my dad. Like, she was like, what? Of course, I was like, yeah, I'm joined the Navy.
00:16:49.20 --> 00:16:54.56 I'm going to go be a Navy seal. So I'll sudden I cut off my cast and now her baby boy is leaving to,
00:16:54.56 --> 00:17:01.36 you know, go join the military and she's my poor mom. You know, and so I go back on Thursday. I walk
00:17:01.36 --> 00:17:05.84 in. They look at me. They look at my cast not being there. They're like, you need to talk to
00:17:05.84 --> 00:17:10.48 petty officer's son. So, like, all right, Roger that. And so I just started the rest of the process.
00:17:10.48 --> 00:17:17.68 And, you know, a lot of rehab, my parents had a cafe. They sold that. So,
00:17:18.48 --> 00:17:22.32 maybe my dad could do construction together to spend as much time together as possible.
00:17:22.32 --> 00:17:27.60 And my mom was able to spend time with her mom that was passing away. And that's how I rehabed my hand.
00:17:27.60 --> 00:17:33.44 And my dad would actually wrap my hand up in some of my old kickboxing raps and boxing raps.
00:17:33.44 --> 00:17:37.28 Tape it up. And then we would tape the hammer to my hand. I couldn't grip it.
00:17:37.28 --> 00:17:40.88 I like I could not grip anything. And, you know, that's why he did. Because I see my old
00:17:40.88 --> 00:17:45.92 bag go to work with a cast on and he would have to tape tools to his cast to work.
00:17:45.92 --> 00:17:51.20 I mean, your dad's not the kind of guy that's going to let broken limbs stop him from getting a good
00:17:51.20 --> 00:17:55.04 day's work and just tape that tool to your body and make something happen.
00:17:55.76 --> 00:18:00.40 So, that's what he did with me. And it was awesome. And he knew, like, I wanted to go to
00:18:00.40 --> 00:18:06.88 buds and I was going to go to buds. And so, he would push me to my absolute limit every day at work.
00:18:06.88 --> 00:18:11.68 Like, I mean, every day meant, I mean, I would be pissed sometimes borderline crimes. I
00:18:11.68 --> 00:18:16.88 so mad, not like tears of like, you know, pain or whatever. I was so mad at him. And he'd see it.
00:18:16.88 --> 00:18:21.52 And he'd throw it back a little bit and he'd make, you know, some days like, I'd come in
00:18:21.52 --> 00:18:27.68 to work on over sometimes. And he would be like, hey, I need to go read a 90 pound jack hammer.
00:18:27.68 --> 00:18:32.000 There was no need for a 90 pound jack hammer. Yes, there is. He's a jack hammer. You're brain.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.40 That's exactly it. And so for eight hours, I would be jack hammering concrete with a 90 pound jack
00:18:38.40 --> 00:18:43.84 hammer while he was doing what he's doing. And then, I mean, it was awesome, though. I mean, he
00:18:43.84 --> 00:18:49.36 would push me to the absolute limit in my mom and him. Or awesome, with communications and helping
00:18:49.36 --> 00:18:54.32 me out with stuff. And it was good. And so then I went, I left September 5, 2001.
00:18:55.12 --> 00:19:01.92 Had a seal contract. I was in buds. I was in boot camp when 9-11 happened. And, you know,
00:19:01.92 --> 00:19:06.96 it was just weird. I was so pissed. Did they tell you guys about it? Yeah, we were all locked down.
00:19:07.60 --> 00:19:12.08 And they were like, hey, the nation's been attacked. You need to get us more info and we're like.
00:19:12.08 --> 00:19:18.56 What? Of course, you have all the week-minded people in there that start crying. Like, I'm 18, right?
00:19:18.56 --> 00:19:24.72 Like, barely 18. And there's just grown men crying. I didn't show it up for this. I'm like,
00:19:25.60 --> 00:19:28.72 I'm getting fired up, like, you need to shut up. So down, like, I'm just like,
00:19:28.72 --> 00:19:33.20 he's looking for a battle accident at this point. Yeah, I'm like, how do I go to bud right now? Do I have
00:19:33.20 --> 00:19:37.28 to finish boot camp? Can I just go, you know? But yeah, so I was in boot camp when I leveled up.
00:19:37.28 --> 00:19:44.24 And then I always felt like, I didn't feel like I knew that being a Navy SEAL is what I needed to do.
00:19:44.24 --> 00:19:49.44 What I wanted to do is what God wanted me to do. And just everything just fell into place.
00:19:49.44 --> 00:19:56.08 You know, it was pretty awesome. So then you go to buds. You went to buds right around the same
00:19:56.08 --> 00:20:01.84 time as late for an Andrew Paul. I was one class behind them. They were class 241. I was class 242.
00:20:01.84 --> 00:20:07.12 And then you, but you ended up in SQT with those guys. Yeah. Yeah. All this is, which is the,
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:12.40 which is like the training after you get through the basics, seal training buds, which is where
00:20:12.40 --> 00:20:17.12 you do pushups and all that stuff and do pull ups and you have a boat on your head and all that
00:20:17.12 --> 00:20:20.32 stuff and bunch of people quit. Then you go to something a little bit more advanced.
00:20:20.96 --> 00:20:26.40 Called SQT where you actually learned some SEAL skills. Yeah. And then you check into a team.
00:20:26.40 --> 00:20:32.96 And then you get, so you check into team three. Yep. Check into team three. And knock out your first
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:37.68 between as a new guy. What was that like? It was, it was good. It was cool. You know, I checked into
00:20:37.68 --> 00:20:42.32 team three and you know, it was like, okay, we need some volunteers. We're going to a driving school.
00:20:42.32 --> 00:20:47.52 It's an off-road, hummer racing and navigation school. I was like, how do I get my hand up fast enough
00:20:47.52 --> 00:20:53.20 for that? And it's just worked out great. Like I literally checked into the team. The team's ridiculous.
00:20:53.20 --> 00:20:58.96 It is. I mean, you're 18 years old. Either like everyone said you'd off-road racing school
00:20:59.20 --> 00:21:03.36 for free or you'd bunch of money to go there by the way. So you can buy good meals. Yeah. You're going to go
00:21:03.36 --> 00:21:07.84 for a month. Two weeks straight is going to be off-road driving racing and two weeks going to be
00:21:07.84 --> 00:21:13.20 navigation. I was like, I literally just, yeah, I just come back from Kodiak Alaskan. We were doing
00:21:13.20 --> 00:21:16.96 our cold weather training. So I was up there. I was gone for a month, come back,
00:21:16.96 --> 00:21:23.12 legitimately for a couple of days. And you know, I grow from other times, I call you back. I'm so happy.
00:21:23.12 --> 00:21:29.92 And then I'll say, I was like, I'm waving tomorrow. And I mean, I was just like, I was just happy.
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:34.08 You know, I was like, yes, this is awesome. This is legit. I'm in the teams. Like I'm getting to do stuff.
00:21:34.08 --> 00:21:40.24 You know, and I went out there. There was a freaking war going on. Yeah. I just wanted to be
00:21:40.24 --> 00:21:47.44 as well equipped as possible. And one of my good-brows, Derek Benson, he was killed on
00:21:47.44 --> 00:21:53.44 extortion 17. He's from Northern California as well. And he was one of both class ahead of me.
00:21:53.44 --> 00:21:58.96 So he had checked in the team of a team three prior to me. We both went to that driving school together.
00:21:58.96 --> 00:22:03.92 And that's where we just became like best friends. You know, so it was awesome. It was a good time
00:22:03.92 --> 00:22:08.96 out there. You know, learned a lot. And you know, there's an older team guys out there too. You know,
00:22:08.96 --> 00:22:14.96 that I got actually interact with. And you know, just guys not from my platoon. So they weren't so hard
00:22:14.96 --> 00:22:19.20 on me because I was a new guy for the same time. Like I was just learning the balance of the teams.
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:25.36 Because I'm overly nice and social. And I like to talk to everybody and be everybody's friend.
00:22:25.36 --> 00:22:29.68 And when you're a new guy in the sealed teams, that's usually not the best thing. When you're like,
00:22:29.68 --> 00:22:34.56 hey, how are you doing? Buddy? You know, they're like shut up. Like, or like, why are you talking to
00:22:34.56 --> 00:22:39.28 me? And I'm like, because we're going to be friends. Like, we're going to war together. Let's be friends.
00:22:39.28 --> 00:22:47.28 You know, so, you know, but it was cool. You know, and then, um, come back and, um, then all of a sudden,
00:22:47.28 --> 00:22:52.96 we're headed out on our first trip. And we're headed out to Shaws to do shooting school. And, um,
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:57.76 I mean, we're getting ready to fly out there. And I just see the big huge native American dude.
00:22:57.76 --> 00:23:03.12 I'm like, I hope he's in my platoon. You know, I mean, I'm just like, you're drawn to like just
00:23:03.12 --> 00:23:09.28 awesome warrior looking guys, right? And he's just very stoic and just so I was like, dude, I really
00:23:09.28 --> 00:23:15.52 hope he's in my platoon. And he was, it's my boy Steve Chiro. You know, he lives out in Vegas. And, um,
00:23:15.52 --> 00:23:19.52 you know, he's, he's, he's an awesome old guy to have in the platoon. You know, and then
00:23:19.52 --> 00:23:24.88 rest of the other guys in the platoon, um, you know, they're still active. Dude, he's like, I'm not going
00:23:24.88 --> 00:23:31.68 to drop their names. Um, you know, my boy Pepper, this is Nick name. He was like the perfect old guy to have.
00:23:31.68 --> 00:23:37.44 Because he was so hard on you. Like, you were just waiting for him to whip your ass. But he also
00:23:37.44 --> 00:23:42.56 mentored and guided you. And actually taught you stuff, you know, and it wasn't just, I'm not
00:23:42.56 --> 00:23:45.84 hammering you because you're a new guy. He's like, I'm a hammering you because you're a new guy. But
00:23:45.84 --> 00:23:52.80 show you what you need to be doing and why what you did was wrong. Um, so I was fired up, super
00:23:52.80 --> 00:23:58.08 fired up. So we go out to the chas, you know, your first trip super overwhelming. You know,
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:02.40 your soul and nervous said it isn't they even told us, okay, this is usually a trip where you
00:24:02.40 --> 00:24:06.000 want it to be halfway or towards the end so you can get a solid grass from what you're doing and
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.36 grow. Um, but we got after it was awesome. Like I said, although, you know, the older guys, um,
00:24:11.36 --> 00:24:18.000 we're solid, uh, we had a really weak LPO and, um, he actually got fired on that trip. So I was a little
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.48 just, you know, concerning to me at first, Mike. Okay. That's for the LPO. And then he's a complete
00:24:24.48 --> 00:24:33.84 third. That's one of the, uh, myths of definitely of the seal teams is when you come in and you think
00:24:33.84 --> 00:24:40.16 every guy is a hard combat warrior and then you get in and you look at some guys and you go wait a second.
00:24:40.16 --> 00:24:44.000 That's not that's not who that's not who I was thinking I was going to be working with. Yeah.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.20 And of course on the other end of the spectrum, you meet guys where like I want to be like that guy.
00:24:48.08 --> 00:24:53.84 So so you guys, you guys wrap through that work up and go in your first deployment. How is that
00:24:53.84 --> 00:24:57.20 first deployment of you, which I wrapped in your first deployment, right? Um, yeah. Well, for the second
00:24:57.20 --> 00:25:04.24 hour, first half went to Gwam, which was just heartening. You know, Mike too. It was a war going on.
00:25:04.24 --> 00:25:08.88 Let's go to war. How cool you're going to go to Gwam. But, you know, it's part of the, you know,
00:25:08.88 --> 00:25:12.08 it's just part of the, you know, part of the mission. Part of the mission. One of the, you know,
00:25:12.08 --> 00:25:17.52 yeah, again, military people deploy all over the world all the time to maintain stability
00:25:17.52 --> 00:25:24.64 in that includes all units of the military, even special operations. So seals. Sometimes you get
00:25:24.64 --> 00:25:32.08 deployed to places where there's no, you know, really visible threat. Yeah. And it's not what seals
00:25:32.08 --> 00:25:36.80 generally want to do. Yeah. So we did training, we crossed trainers, couple different countries.
00:25:37.92 --> 00:25:43.76 You know, some other pertinent went to the PI, we were in Gwam. You know, we went to Thailand to work
00:25:43.76 --> 00:25:48.48 with the Thai seals for nine days and I mean, it was cool getting to see how other countries do stuff.
00:25:48.48 --> 00:25:54.48 And now that I look back at it, it did give me a much bigger picture, you know, overview of
00:25:54.48 --> 00:26:01.20 stuff. But at the time, like, I'm not even 21, like I just want to get after it, you know, and
00:26:01.20 --> 00:26:06.56 uh, I didn't, uh, for the first half, but then we ripped and we got our act. I'm like, yes, going
00:26:06.56 --> 00:26:11.28 our act. Well, I knew what we were headed over there to do. I was hoping there would be, you know,
00:26:11.28 --> 00:26:17.12 they'd be able to do a lot of different stuff and in up doing personal security, um, for some higher
00:26:17.12 --> 00:26:21.92 dignitaries over there during the elections. And I mean, it was cool. You know, what you're looking
00:26:21.92 --> 00:26:25.92 back now, you look at what you did and you put that on your resume, people like, what, wow, you did that.
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:30.64 I'm, to me, I was thinking, you know, it sucked, you know, but it didn't. It was also very,
00:26:30.64 --> 00:26:36.32 it was a very good learning experience. Um, and it was part of the mission. In the problem is,
00:26:36.32 --> 00:26:43.28 when they had a gap in that protection, you know, some team guys came to do it and team guys
00:26:43.28 --> 00:26:47.36 do what they do and they just knocked it out of the park. So I guess what? Team guys now have the
00:26:47.36 --> 00:26:52.48 mission for that. And um, but it was cool. You know, we worked with, uh, some different units, some
00:26:52.48 --> 00:26:57.52 Marines and Army guys and they were phenomenal over there as well. And I was, it was awesome to
00:26:57.52 --> 00:27:01.36 learn from them. You know, guys I've been on there, you know, a couple deployments already and the
00:27:01.36 --> 00:27:08.96 wars hasn't really really kicked off and um, that was good. Um, yeah, or, and then our chief got fired.
00:27:08.96 --> 00:27:17.04 It was just like, chiefies. Um, but I had shared with saw like our OIC, AYC, who became our
00:27:17.04 --> 00:27:24.16 the Delta Bulltune Commander, saw the dudes, you know, and so we just had to weed out some of the
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:32.24 E-coins right on. And that's the nature of that mission, you know, is defense and I don't want to
00:27:32.24 --> 00:27:37.76 be on defense ever, right? I won't be on offense. So where I want to be. So it's a tough, it was a tough
00:27:37.76 --> 00:27:43.52 mission for the guys to meant to, I mean, of course, you, you never know this from their, from their
00:27:43.52 --> 00:27:48.56 professionalism, but no one was saying jumping up and down saying, hey, great, we, we had to be on defense.
00:27:48.56 --> 00:27:55.20 Yeah, all the time for a long period of time. And the fact that the guys did perform so well and
00:27:55.20 --> 00:28:00.16 that we kept the mission again, like you said, we kept the mission because we did a good job,
00:28:00.16 --> 00:28:03.84 not that we were jumping up and down excited about doing it because we don't even be on defense.
00:28:03.84 --> 00:28:09.36 We want to be on offense. Yeah, absolutely. Um, yeah, I look back on my, you know, some of the
00:28:09.36 --> 00:28:15.76 thing, and I did get to do a pretty cool thing there. Um, and then, I mean, we've, we've got to
00:28:15.76 --> 00:28:20.48 see all of our rack, you know, I got to go up to Northern Iraq up in Kurdistan. Oh, yeah, because
00:28:20.48 --> 00:28:25.76 those dignitaries were traveled around. Well, he was Kurdish and he was from, uh, from Northern Iraq,
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:31.20 and it was, it was gorgeous up there. Yeah. Well, we actually stood, you know, so I had a little
00:28:31.20 --> 00:28:36.48 come to Jesus talk with, um, one of older guys, you know, he was just kind of real in me back in
00:28:36.48 --> 00:28:41.04 because I, I wasn't very happy. I was pissed that other guys were out doing direct actions,
00:28:41.04 --> 00:28:45.84 DAs, and I want to be doing that, and you know, my boy pepper, you know, he talked to me,
00:28:45.84 --> 00:28:50.48 he sat me down, he was like, man, this is a big picture thing, you know, and this is part of it.
00:28:50.48 --> 00:28:54.96 He's like, and you're a new guy. He's like, I know you want to get out there. I know you're
00:28:54.96 --> 00:29:00.24 aggressive, but it's a good deal, you know, like, yes, it's not the ideal thing that we want to do.
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:05.92 He's like, but this is not a bad deal. You know, we're in civilian clothes and fully armored
00:29:05.92 --> 00:29:10.88 SUVs, you know, getting a trial around this guy. And he just was like, you just need a change in
00:29:10.88 --> 00:29:15.04 mindset, you know, and he's like, you need to stay focused because after this deployment,
00:29:15.04 --> 00:29:18.16 it might be something completely different, you know, and he's like, just stay the core,
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:23.76 stay focused and, you know, get the mission done. And it was awesome talk. I needed that, you know,
00:29:23.76 --> 00:29:26.80 I just needed that guidance and mentorship, because I was young, you know, for sure.
00:29:26.80 --> 00:29:30.96 Pepper's the older guy, he had a good amount of experience, and, you know, he just,
00:29:30.96 --> 00:29:36.56 you just knew what I needed to hear. And, you know, rough me up a little bit and continue to
00:29:36.56 --> 00:29:42.88 comment, it was good. It was awesome. Learned a lot from it. So yeah. So you get back from that deployment.
00:29:42.88 --> 00:29:48.16 Yep. And this is when you start, you, this is when we formed up, and we started working together.
00:29:48.16 --> 00:29:55.36 Yes, sir. And T U bruiser. Yep. Again, you went to come back from, or, or come back from
00:29:55.36 --> 00:29:59.36 deployment, and then all of a sudden, I was like, hey, we, we need snipers. I'm like, how fast
00:29:59.36 --> 00:30:06.16 I can get over this one, you know. And, uh, literally gone, like again within a week. And, uh,
00:30:06.16 --> 00:30:11.68 went through the NSW short course, which, you know, we didn't get our snipers certificates from that,
00:30:11.68 --> 00:30:16.64 because we didn't do everything, but I didn't care. You're giving me sniper guns. You're, you know,
00:30:16.64 --> 00:30:20.64 I know how to use them. They're dope. Then I get a kill savages. Okay, you know.
00:30:21.84 --> 00:30:26.08 You know what's crazy is, remember when they used to try and they had rules about how much we
00:30:26.08 --> 00:30:30.40 could be gone from home. Yeah. For those days. Oh, we violated it. And it's, it was for, yes, we
00:30:30.40 --> 00:30:35.76 violated it, violated it, violated them. But then young guys and the teams and a lot of old guys, too,
00:30:35.76 --> 00:30:38.96 they literally are raising their hand for everything. Like, oh, yeah, get me out of here, man. Oh,
00:30:38.96 --> 00:30:42.08 you're going to send me that school. Oh, you're going to send me on another deployment. And it's
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:45.52 weird because there's some people that, you know, a guy that's married has a family that they're,
00:30:45.52 --> 00:30:49.92 they don't want to do that anymore. And they shouldn't have to. But they blanket apply the rules
00:30:49.92 --> 00:30:54.16 across the board, everybody. Because I'll tell you what, when you're 19 years old and you're in the
00:30:54.16 --> 00:30:58.88 Sequel teams, you don't want to be at home any night of the week. You want to be either on
00:30:58.88 --> 00:31:03.04 deployment or getting trained and getting after it. That's what's awesome. Yeah. But they, they
00:31:03.04 --> 00:31:09.76 blanket those rules, which is a bummer. Yeah. I mean, I was just fired up and to go, they're going to
00:31:09.76 --> 00:31:15.36 start for school. Yeah. And I like because, um, you know, it's a big deal. It's a huge deal to get to go
00:31:15.36 --> 00:31:20.16 to start a school. And one of the older guys in the Poutoon, he's still active in the teams,
00:31:20.16 --> 00:31:23.84 I don't want to say his name, but he's one of my real good buddies and I really looked up to him.
00:31:23.84 --> 00:31:28.64 We did an awesome mission together on that first deployment. And I know you're talking about,
00:31:28.64 --> 00:31:35.12 yeah, he's one of my favorite guys. The Badger. Yeah. The Badger. And, um, you know, he's just,
00:31:36.88 --> 00:31:40.56 this is an awesome guy. He was a sniper. You know, he would always talk to me about little
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.12 things. And I was just, even before I went, he was like, teaching me stuff and he's like, yeah,
00:31:45.12 --> 00:31:49.28 you know, this is this. So, I don't know if you had to say him, he going there or what, but I went,
00:31:49.28 --> 00:31:53.84 I was super excited. And then also Chris, you know, Chris was a big influence as well. He's,
00:31:53.84 --> 00:31:58.48 you know, he's a successful sniper on that his second deployment. I first, I'm a loser. Yeah,
00:31:58.48 --> 00:32:01.92 and you're just hearing about what he's doing in a solution. I was like, please, please, Lord.
00:32:01.92 --> 00:32:06.32 Like, I just want to do this so badly. And you hear Chris, you know, tell stories and hear
00:32:06.32 --> 00:32:11.12 other people telling stories about Chris. You know, and I, I even had a buddy who was back from
00:32:11.12 --> 00:32:16.32 Sacramento, who's a Marine, who he was a Marine officer in charge of Chris and those guys over there.
00:32:16.32 --> 00:32:22.40 So he's telling me stories that we're just like, I was like, what? You know, I do this is awesome.
00:32:22.40 --> 00:32:28.16 And so, you guys got, we got to the short course. It was, it was legit. It was in the summer
00:32:28.16 --> 00:32:32.24 out in the mountains and desert doing everything. Guys are blocking out on their stocks because
00:32:32.24 --> 00:32:37.68 it's 120 degrees and you're trying to do a four hour stock in a gilly suit. And, but, uh,
00:32:37.68 --> 00:32:42.72 which was awesome because it prepared us for a Romadi. It's like, dude, the worst stuff, you know,
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:48.64 you're just, okay, you know, and, you know, how to great time and structures are pretty solid, you know,
00:32:48.64 --> 00:32:53.68 and, um, then all of a sudden it was like, because we had a condensed work up. You know,
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:58.72 they're like, hey, we got to get gone. So normally, what, you would take 18 months,
00:32:58.72 --> 00:33:05.60 we had a condensed into 11 months. And, you know, all of a sudden, then we're headed out to
00:33:06.48 --> 00:33:11.76 our desert journey facility for our first trip. Yeah. And that's where we met for the first
00:33:11.76 --> 00:33:17.92 met. Yeah. I heard about this guy, Jock. And guys were fired up because we were like,
00:33:17.92 --> 00:33:24.88 dude, this guy is fired up. He's just, you know, I think it was just, you know, this bigger,
00:33:24.88 --> 00:33:30.48 stoic guy that was professional, who had a good amount of experience than teams and who just
00:33:30.48 --> 00:33:36.80 wanted to get in the fight. I was like, yes, this is what we need. You know, it was pretty apparent
00:33:36.80 --> 00:33:41.36 when I first met you that you wanted to get in the fight, too. Yeah, I might have been bandaged up.
00:33:41.36 --> 00:33:48.32 A little bit from smashing out a car window. Yeah. But, you know, yeah, some idiots downtown.
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.72 It's like, what were you saying that was saying to you when I saw that? So when you saw it,
00:33:55.36 --> 00:33:59.52 yeah, you're like, hey, I'm Jocko. I was like, I'm JP. I know you are. I was like, like,
00:33:59.52 --> 00:34:04.000 that, you know, it's kind of like, okay. And you're like, so what's up with the wrist?
00:34:04.56 --> 00:34:09.04 I was like, I got a couple stitches. And you're like, from what? It was like,
00:34:09.04 --> 00:34:13.12 you know, smash out a car window with my elbow and I got caught. He's like, oh,
00:34:13.84 --> 00:34:17.84 you're going to stop doing that stupid shit. Like, yeah, he's like, you need to be training here with the guys
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:22.64 and with us and focused on work up. And he's like, if you want to fight, we fight. You know,
00:34:22.64 --> 00:34:29.04 I was like, Roger that, sir. And I was like, I'm going to go workout. So I'm going to walk into the gym.
00:34:29.04 --> 00:34:33.84 You know, I just changed out the bandages. I had stitches and staples in my arm and I had all
00:34:33.84 --> 00:34:39.84 bandaged up and trying to get after us. I was going to go workout. And there I see the silver back
00:34:39.84 --> 00:34:45.44 gorilla. It was awesome. It was good. You know, just, and you just set the president, you know,
00:34:45.44 --> 00:34:50.40 you set the tone for, hey, yeah, it's cool to be aggressive and want to fight and get after it. But
00:34:50.40 --> 00:34:56.000 you do it in the right place and the right time and don't forget, you know, at the end of the day,
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.96 we're going to work to kill bad guys. That's the number one focus. And it was just like,
00:35:00.96 --> 00:35:07.12 that just kind of really opened up my eyes. So it was cool. Yeah, and that work up was,
00:35:08.48 --> 00:35:15.20 that work up was awesome. It was so excited. It was so much fun. I mean, just just the energy there.
00:35:15.20 --> 00:35:19.28 I mean, everyone was ready to get after it. And you, you drove it and all of us, you know,
00:35:19.28 --> 00:35:25.28 I remember you coming up to me when we're in between Iads and you're like, hey, every time,
00:35:25.28 --> 00:35:29.28 like, someone gets to door, I want you to be the dude that's as loud as possible. You told me to
00:35:29.28 --> 00:35:34.56 go put to tape J. P on the back of my helmet. I always wanted to be able to find you. And,
00:35:34.56 --> 00:35:40.24 you know, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but oh no, I did. I mean, that's a legit right there. So,
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:44.48 hey, I'll tell you right now. I say this all the time. Well, I should, I shouldn't be sad.
00:35:45.20 --> 00:35:51.12 Say I say this all the time. But there's people that have certain qualities, right? Certain qualities,
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:58.88 whether they're leadership qualities, whether they're skills at art or at speaking or at basketball,
00:35:58.88 --> 00:36:04.40 right? People have certain qualities. So, you had a good ability. You had a great ability to get
00:36:04.40 --> 00:36:09.04 command of something and make something happen very quickly, right? And that's, it's a because you're
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:13.44 allowed, you're allowed number one, number two, you're aggressive. Number three, you can take whatever
00:36:13.44 --> 00:36:18.48 that problem is and like get it into some quick words. You can simplify it into something quickly and
00:36:18.48 --> 00:36:24.08 say it. And as soon as I saw that you could do that, because we have to get people to perform
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:30.32 fairly complex things in chaotic situations. But when I saw that you had that skill,
00:36:30.96 --> 00:36:35.92 I said, okay, he's a guy that I can utilize and that his Petune Commander can utilize and that
00:36:35.92 --> 00:36:40.56 that the whole troop can utilize to handle such certain situations when there's some chaos going on
00:36:40.56 --> 00:36:43.92 and something needs to be straightened up. So, what I want you to do is take some rigors tape and
00:36:43.92 --> 00:36:48.16 I want you to write J.P. on your helmet. So, whenever I'm looking around on my night vision or
00:36:48.16 --> 00:36:51.68 or during the daytime and I see you just see a bunch of helmets that look the same. Now, I know it's
00:36:51.68 --> 00:36:56.32 J.P. When I see him coming like, oh, J.P. Make this happen right here. And J.P. can make it happen right there.
00:36:56.32 --> 00:37:02.32 I still have that helmet with the tape. I'm sitting in my garage on the shelf. That's all.
00:37:02.32 --> 00:37:12.72 That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. So, we get, we get obviously orders two weeks prior to
00:37:12.72 --> 00:37:16.08 deployment that we're going to our body. We had thought we were going somewhere else. We thought
00:37:16.08 --> 00:37:19.76 we were going to back dad. We thought we're going to have kind of a cookie cutter deployment of
00:37:19.76 --> 00:37:25.36 what the teams have been doing for a few years. And we find out two weeks before deployment that
00:37:25.36 --> 00:37:32.40 we're going to our body. And, wait, how did you find out? Then I call, do I? Did the Delta soon
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:35.52 come in? Did the chief call you? How did you find out we were going to our body? Because you guys were all
00:37:35.52 --> 00:37:40.96 on leave. You remember? I don't, I don't think they even told us to talk about that about it.
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:43.84 I mean, because they did all the interviews. They did all the interviews. What was going on?
00:37:43.84 --> 00:37:47.44 Yeah, they did all the interviews. Yeah, they did all the interviews. I don't think they told us
00:37:47.44 --> 00:37:55.04 about it until I told the leaders. Yeah. And, as it hey guys, stand by to get some.
00:37:55.04 --> 00:37:58.72 Yeah. Yeah, because I remember we found out we were on leave. We came home.
00:37:59.52 --> 00:38:04.80 Came back to San Diego and we're getting a roll out. That's when we found out where we're going.
00:38:05.36 --> 00:38:11.20 And we're getting right in. We had all our families. We had our families, you know,
00:38:11.20 --> 00:38:16.40 the day we're shipping off to say goodbye. And there's a couple of guys like reading, like news reports
00:38:16.40 --> 00:38:20.88 and articles about the area we're going to. And I'm like trying to like pull them all the way.
00:38:20.88 --> 00:38:25.44 So she doesn't hear this, you know what I mean? And my dad's just like listening, like getting fired up.
00:38:25.44 --> 00:38:31.68 He's like, yes. You know, my dad, you know, you could tell as a father, he's very excited for me.
00:38:31.68 --> 00:38:37.68 My mom's terrified and nervous. But my dad was nervous as well. Rightfully so, you know,
00:38:37.68 --> 00:38:42.40 like your son's going off to war and combat, but he was just, it was just mixing emotions for him.
00:38:42.40 --> 00:38:47.36 And so he was trying to hide like the nervousness by saying, when are you leaving?
00:38:47.36 --> 00:38:50.40 Come on, we've been waiting. It's about time for you to go. One of my dad here.
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:58.000 He's just remembered when I got told, when they said the, when the commanding officer brought me in,
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.76 and he's trying to sell to me, going to Ramadi instead of going to Baghdad, he's like
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:11.36 proposing it as like, hey, you know, this could be good. And inside, I'm like, oh my God, I'm like still.
00:39:11.36 --> 00:39:16.40 And I remembered, I bargained for something. There's something that I said, well,
00:39:16.40 --> 00:39:20.64 well, we want this. If we can do this, then we can make it happen. I think it was gear or some kind of
00:39:20.64 --> 00:39:26.80 gear swap we did. But anyways, I remember them trying to sell it to me. And I knew I was in such a
00:39:26.80 --> 00:39:31.76 good position because it's like someone trying to sell you free money. You know what I mean?
00:39:31.76 --> 00:39:36.000 I was like, oh, you want to screw the money? Okay. Let me think about that for a second.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.04 And inside, I'm going, don't blow it. Just act cool. Yeah. How careful. Those get too excited. Just,
00:39:41.04 --> 00:39:45.20 you know, maybe you might be able to leverage something, just relax inside. Like, okay, you know,
00:39:45.20 --> 00:39:48.72 I think we can make it happen. I need a little bit of this. I might need a couple more support
00:39:48.72 --> 00:39:53.84 personnel out there to give us a hand getting acclimated and getting the turnover done. But if I can get
00:39:53.84 --> 00:39:59.28 five or six more personas, I'm just gathering logistics support for my troop. And that's what I was
00:39:59.28 --> 00:40:05.36 bargaining for. I was gathering logistics support for the troop getting more C. B's to come help us.
00:40:05.36 --> 00:40:10.000 And more intel guys. Like, as long as we can have this and that. And he's like, yeah, I'll talk to them.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.28 We'll see if we can make it happen. And it happened. Yeah. The C.O. is awesome. Solid dude. Yeah.
00:40:19.28 --> 00:40:25.04 Yeah. So I remember, yeah, because I got in trouble when I went home on leave during Christmas
00:40:25.04 --> 00:40:32.56 time. Am I seeing some kind of a pattern of trouble here? Or, you know, if you want to say that,
00:40:32.56 --> 00:40:36.88 you know what, but I just want to my best friend. I didn't have the outlets. One of my best friends
00:40:36.88 --> 00:40:43.28 in the Silti when I was younger, right? We were the same way. We were maniacs. And one time he got
00:40:43.28 --> 00:40:50.72 in a really big trouble. And the, the platoon commander, who's one of my favorite guys in the guy that
00:40:50.72 --> 00:40:55.76 inspired me to go the officer route because he was a priori and listed guy and he was an awesome guy.
00:40:55.76 --> 00:41:02.24 He was made the platoon awesome for us. That guy. So I'm thinking he's going to, he must be so angry
00:41:02.24 --> 00:41:08.64 at my buddy that got in big trouble. Like borderline international incident. And I kind of said,
00:41:08.64 --> 00:41:14.48 hey, you know, are you mad at him for what happened or what do you think of this? And he goes,
00:41:14.48 --> 00:41:22.24 he said something along the lines of, he's a warrior. You can't stop these things from happening.
00:41:22.24 --> 00:41:28.56 It's, it's in your guys' blood. We have to just deal with it the best we can. Yeah, and you,
00:41:28.56 --> 00:41:32.64 you guys did, you know, that's what I was always, that's what was always my attitude. You know,
00:41:32.64 --> 00:41:38.56 I look back now I'm 33 and I'm like man, but you know, you learn from your mistakes. And he makes
00:41:38.56 --> 00:41:42.96 you don't, you know, pay them again. I got, you know, I got, I was up in Reno, I got arrested for,
00:41:42.96 --> 00:41:46.72 you know, like older guys started to fight with me and my friends. And I was with non-team guy
00:41:46.72 --> 00:41:52.000 friends. They're super passive guys. And he's an older, like much bigger guy, you know, and
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.08 you know, it was coming out, you had a bottle on his hand. There's just, you know, anyways,
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:02.48 do some damage to him. He ends up in the hospital for a long time. I get rolled up, I get arrested.
00:42:02.48 --> 00:42:05.76 I go there, they're looking to my wallet, they're like security clients,
00:42:05.76 --> 00:42:11.04 still team 3 and I'm like, yeah, and the cop goes, why didn't you tell me this?
00:42:11.04 --> 00:42:14.40 When we're out there, he's like, I would have dropped you off around the corner.
00:42:14.40 --> 00:42:18.24 I was like, well, I didn't want, you know, I'm not going to try to pull that card. I made him a
00:42:18.24 --> 00:42:23.68 stake. He's like, well, you're here now. So we have to deal with it. So I go home. I remember I,
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:29.68 and I tell the LPO about it, it's like, we got to tell Chief and Chief's like, are we going to
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:34.96 still the LIC? We got to go tell the Command Mass Chief, Command Mass Chief, you know, an
00:42:34.96 --> 00:42:40.72 awesome Mass Chief was press on and bro. Too phenomenal. I mean, just couldn't get better,
00:42:40.72 --> 00:42:44.48 higher- than-lessed leaders ever, right? So of course, you know, they're here in the story,
00:42:44.48 --> 00:42:49.36 and they kind of like give me the rundown. You know, Mass Chief press on goes,
00:42:49.36 --> 00:42:54.24 but you think you're the first team guy to get a rest of your fighting? Let me tell you some stories.
00:42:54.24 --> 00:42:57.44 He just kind of, he's like, hey, we just got, we got to fix this. You know what I mean? He's like,
00:42:57.44 --> 00:43:02.64 obviously there's clearly self-defense, and he's like, whatever you need from us. That was good.
00:43:02.64 --> 00:43:07.52 Cool, whatever. What I do is I make the mistake is I go back home on Christmas leaves shortly
00:43:07.52 --> 00:43:13.52 after that, and I got to wet and reckless. So not a DUI, but you know, whatever, close enough,
00:43:13.52 --> 00:43:20.32 I was an idiot, and, you know, I'm super mad. You know, I'm only 22, you know, I'm not even 23 yet.
00:43:20.32 --> 00:43:27.36 And, you know, we were crushing the work up, so it was, I was built, I felt even better about life,
00:43:27.36 --> 00:43:31.04 and everything, I was like that, and we know we're going to war, and you know, I just made
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:36.32 a mistake, and you know, pay the consequences, you know, I'd come home, and I'm like, oh,
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:42.16 what do I do? I'm like, they're going to kill me. I was like, I'm possibly not going to
00:43:42.16 --> 00:43:47.36 deploy. And I remember I broke down, like I just broke down emotionally. I'm like, I just threw
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:53.52 everything away, you know, like, for what, you know, and I was really upset, and I went and told
00:43:54.08 --> 00:43:59.36 the Badger, you know, about it first, I was like, I need some advice. And I was like, you know,
00:43:59.36 --> 00:44:02.64 I think I can take leave and take care of this on my own, and everything, he goes,
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:08.16 yeah, I think we can, he's like, but if not, you know, it's a big risk, you know,
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:14.24 he's like dude, we have solid leadership right now. Now's the time that you just get your
00:44:14.24 --> 00:44:18.72 book kicked for this, and just deal with it, you know, he's like, dude, just take what comes out
00:44:18.72 --> 00:44:24.64 you. I'm like, I broke, you know, I was like sick to my stomach, I was like, oh, I don't know how
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:29.76 this could turn out. We go to the LPL, he's like, you boo boo, I'm like, right, you have
00:44:29.76 --> 00:44:37.04 to get rid of that, go to chief, chief, same thing, go, LIC, I was Andrew Paul, Andrew Paul,
00:44:37.04 --> 00:44:42.88 like, JP, really. Like, he was just, what hurt is how disappointed everyone is disappointed,
00:44:42.88 --> 00:44:49.20 like you're better than that. And I was, you know, and then so we go back over there to go talk
00:44:49.20 --> 00:44:56.08 to Master Chief Yardboro and press on, and I was just like, I was so ashamed. Like, I was just,
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:00.96 you know, I just got the chills, I was just, I was disgusted myself, you know. So, you know,
00:45:00.96 --> 00:45:05.68 they got through and they're like, all right, well, I'm gonna have a chief, chief, you're bored.
00:45:05.68 --> 00:45:11.68 So if you go to keep your tried and stay in the teams, I was just like, try not to throw up
00:45:11.68 --> 00:45:15.44 like you're dead in there, I'm like, go back to the between space. Like, how do you even
00:45:15.44 --> 00:45:19.28 function the rest of the day after that? Like, I was like, someone looking at the bathroom,
00:45:19.28 --> 00:45:23.36 I'm like, maybe we shouldn't have that best, you know, maybe I was like, dude,
00:45:23.36 --> 00:45:30.48 anyways, um, on social short, they, uh, I had the chief's review board, and luckily,
00:45:31.36 --> 00:45:36.40 they were doing remodeling over the compound. So I was two rooms over, but the ceilings were open
00:45:36.40 --> 00:45:41.12 and vaulted. So I could hear them all talking about me beforehand. And of course, you had a bunch of,
00:45:41.12 --> 00:45:44.48 like, it was all the cheese in the command. And you know, there was some cheese there that,
00:45:44.48 --> 00:45:48.56 you know, were support person now. They're like, screw this kid, let's move a ball. Like,
00:45:48.56 --> 00:45:54.56 you know, a lot, and then like, your bro goes, hold up. Like, the kids are good, kid. I was with
00:45:54.56 --> 00:46:00.72 him at SKT, you know, he made a mistake. And so, like, remember him taking my back because he's like,
00:46:00.72 --> 00:46:05.28 oh, really? Let's get ready. And he starts pulling up like, other guys that had made my
00:46:05.28 --> 00:46:09.12 stakes, he's like, what about when you did this? And what about when you did that? He's like,
00:46:09.12 --> 00:46:13.68 no, he's good. And press on, he's like, nope, we're keeping them. We're going to crush him,
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:18.96 but we're keeping them. So I go in there and luckily I had heard that. And so I went in there and just,
00:46:18.96 --> 00:46:24.000 you know, face the man and, you know, the whole rest of work up, I know, it was on restriction.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.96 Yeah, we're on the road. We're awesome trips. We're going to Vegas for a work trip. And guess who
00:46:28.96 --> 00:46:34.56 has a curfew? Did you ever curfew during that? I don't. I do remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Like,
00:46:34.56 --> 00:46:37.76 if I was to go get out food, I had to be back with it in a certain time frame. They're like,
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:41.60 oh, wait, actually, guess what? They serve food here. So you don't need to leave the building.
00:46:41.60 --> 00:46:46.16 You can get room service because you don't need to be sitting down at the tables. I'm like,
00:46:46.96 --> 00:46:51.12 you know, but whatever. I think it's good that you had that kind of sense of fear in there. I mean,
00:46:51.12 --> 00:46:56.80 just looking back, I can tell you right now, you could have like, you could have committed
00:46:56.80 --> 00:47:01.44 a broad series of crimes against humanity. And I would have still taken you on the foot.
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:08.08 And I basically told, bro, that for sure, like, hey, I don't give a shit. Yeah. You know,
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:13.84 it's just, it was very lucky in blast. We were blessed to have, you know, good leaders like you
00:47:13.84 --> 00:47:18.96 and bro and press on in those guys that were just like, hey, man, guys make mistakes. We're going to,
00:47:18.96 --> 00:47:22.48 we're going to fix it. You know, it's not like you guys are like, oh, no big deal. You're like,
00:47:22.48 --> 00:47:26.80 oh, cool. You got to learn. You got to learn from it, you know, and you know, I definitely learned from it.
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:32.000 And the C.O. was super cool. And the C.O. stood by what you guys stood. And that said a lot to me about
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.36 him as a leader as well because he trusted you guys as judge. And I remember he comes out like,
00:47:37.36 --> 00:47:40.40 towards the inner part of the point that we're going to be getting it. We've been getting it the
00:47:40.40 --> 00:47:45.12 whole time. He's like, man, really glad I listened to them and kept you around. Like, so it was this
00:47:45.12 --> 00:47:49.84 awesome. I kind of turned around because it was basically you guys were like, hey, we're going to hold it
00:47:49.84 --> 00:47:55.92 worth that. And we'll see how he does on the point. And when he comes back, we'll hammer him and if we need to.
00:47:55.92 --> 00:48:03.76 So yeah. All right. So we go on the point that. Yep. And like you said, like, people are reading the
00:48:03.76 --> 00:48:08.40 newspaper. I mean, I knew because I was reading all the intel. I mean, I was totally read in and
00:48:08.40 --> 00:48:14.88 was trying to explain to you guys and telling you guys, staying by to get some. We show up there and
00:48:15.84 --> 00:48:22.24 do some, do some, you know, basically the forces almost instantly divided into five different teams.
00:48:22.24 --> 00:48:29.68 And we end up doing big operation over an eastern Romadi. And that kind of set the tone and
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:35.04 carved out a little space for a certain crew. And actually, in the retirement speech that I gave,
00:48:35.04 --> 00:48:39.68 you know, I talk about, hey, we're going to send some guys over here. If you want to go volunteer,
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:43.36 you got to put your name on this list. And of course, everyone put the name on the list,
00:48:43.36 --> 00:48:49.20 which made it go back to the original plan, which was the Delta Plunk Tune Commander saying,
00:48:49.20 --> 00:48:53.92 you know, these are the guys who take I need whatever. Eight guys, I'll take these guys. And,
00:48:53.92 --> 00:48:58.48 you know, had a little make sure that we weren't making anything too unbalanced. But obviously,
00:48:58.48 --> 00:49:05.28 obviously, he wanted you with him. And so you guys roll out to
00:49:06.80 --> 00:49:12.56 correct it or with the first the 506 band brothers. Yeah, those guys are phenomenal. Yeah,
00:49:12.56 --> 00:49:24.88 love those guys. Talk about full metal jacket. A blown out old school. I think it's old school
00:49:24.88 --> 00:49:30.32 or like a university university. All the universities just completely blown out like walls. I mean,
00:49:30.32 --> 00:49:34.40 there's more bags of sand than concrete. I think they're holding the place up.
00:49:35.44 --> 00:49:40.56 You know, with Army Marines live with us in there. And I always show up. Or just like,
00:49:40.56 --> 00:49:46.80 yeah, we for when I went there for that big first kickoff. Yeah, that place was just dirt floors,
00:49:47.52 --> 00:49:53.52 mosquitoes everywhere, bugs everywhere. Yeah. I don't even think there was AC. No, there was,
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:59.84 it was like one dangling light in every room. Yeah. That was hard living. But that was all one big
00:49:59.84 --> 00:50:04.40 room. They had like thick, they had like a sheet of plywood that divided the big room that
00:50:04.40 --> 00:50:09.68 we all ended up eventually like building our own rooms into. Yeah. I remember getting over there and,
00:50:09.68 --> 00:50:17.84 you know, guys, I was so fired up. Yes, I'm in it. Like this is horrible. It's horrible because
00:50:17.84 --> 00:50:21.44 there's a fight going on right here. You know what I mean? Like the nice built up basis. There's
00:50:21.44 --> 00:50:26.64 not a fight there. Where it's like horrible? You know, there's a fight. I was just super excited.
00:50:26.64 --> 00:50:30.72 Yeah, Craig and I were always awesome. And there was guys with the first the 506. That place was
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:36.000 getting mortar every day. That place was getting attacked every day. I mean, remember when we first went
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.80 there and it was like, I said, um, guys, like, can we can we go up on the walls? Can I just
00:50:40.80 --> 00:50:46.16 my first go up on the walls and like defend? And I was like, um, yes. And we did. Yeah, you guys went
00:50:46.16 --> 00:50:50.40 up and started whacking people all the time. Yeah, it was awesome. You didn't even have to leave
00:50:50.40 --> 00:50:55.60 base to kill guys. Yeah. That what kind of a joy is that right there? It's like the best Christmas
00:50:55.60 --> 00:50:59.52 present ever. But it was also the same times like if you want to go grab a child, you have to be
00:50:59.52 --> 00:51:04.64 in full body armor, helmet and your gun because you've got to constantly attack. There's a couple
00:51:04.64 --> 00:51:09.68 times to hear. Do, do, do, and you just hear the incoming mortars and you're sprinting to try to
00:51:09.68 --> 00:51:13.44 either get, you're like, when you're in the middle, you're like, do I go back? Do I go to the
00:51:13.44 --> 00:51:17.44 childhood or are they aiming for our building this time? You know, I remember there was one time
00:51:17.44 --> 00:51:25.44 I was going out to take a shower. This is just a no. Just make one and go. And um, this is a complete
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.80 had my angels god thing and we come back from it up and guys are smoked right? And the most
00:51:32.80 --> 00:51:37.28 guys are just like, I'm just going to get in the bed like my baby wipe shower and just lay down.
00:51:37.84 --> 00:51:41.36 I just wanted to actually just go take a shower right? And so the army guys are awesome. They
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:46.08 gave us the code so we could use it on our times when we came back, you know, instead of the standard
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:51.44 schedule of the army shower time. So I go out there and get to the shower tent and like,
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.40 forgot my lufus sponge. You know, so I can actually try to like wash with my soap and
00:51:56.40 --> 00:52:02.40 our car and cord JP Denel in combat. You know what you got to bring to combat with you?
00:52:02.40 --> 00:52:06.40 Guffing your lufus sponge. That's what I'm talking about. You got to clean the body.
00:52:07.60 --> 00:52:14.56 So anyway, I cycle back and um, as I'm walking back up the steps to get into the thing,
00:52:14.56 --> 00:52:20.40 shower tent gets hit by three mortars. Oh yeah, just showing gone like I was like,
00:52:22.40 --> 00:52:26.000 okay, that was the shower tent that was like 20 meters from full metal jacket, right?
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.92 Yeah, I legitimately was just like in there and I was like, I remember I was like, I'll just put the
00:52:31.92 --> 00:52:37.28 soap in my hands and I was like, nope, that was complete. I had my angels, you know, god was like,
00:52:37.28 --> 00:52:42.08 no, you need to get out of here. And so I walked back and I literally taken the last step like
00:52:42.08 --> 00:52:50.72 into that little dark hallway and I was like, okay, where's my baby wife? So I can
00:52:50.72 --> 00:52:54.80 have to go get some baby and that's what was so crazy. It was like something like that. It was just like,
00:52:54.80 --> 00:53:00.64 okay, shit, I'm pissed. You know, and so baby wife's up and until we get that fix,
00:53:00.64 --> 00:53:05.12 we're doing bottle water shower. You know, you poke holes in the top of a water bottle and
00:53:05.12 --> 00:53:09.76 your buddy squeezes it over you and that's how we shower. Yeah. Yeah. It was awesome.
00:53:09.76 --> 00:53:17.44 Yeah. And that's another thing. The, the, the army guys for the first of the 506. I mean,
00:53:17.44 --> 00:53:21.68 obviously they're living that way too. But every day you'd see them, they're always in the square
00:53:21.68 --> 00:53:26.72 away uniforms, always, you know, shaving every day. No slack. No fucking slack whatsoever.
00:53:26.72 --> 00:53:31.76 Yeah. The first of the 506. And that was the attitude that you guys went over with. Yeah.
00:53:31.76 --> 00:53:35.28 We know. Actually, I made sure our guys had shaved heads because I was the acting
00:53:35.28 --> 00:53:42.48 LPO. The badger was the acting chief. And we, I mean, we rocked the army cam. Yeah. We put
00:53:42.48 --> 00:53:47.60 you guys in the army cam. We camis and we all had shaved heads and we shaved every day. You know,
00:53:47.60 --> 00:53:53.20 we just looked like the army. I mean, because who cares about haircut and a shave? You know,
00:53:53.20 --> 00:53:57.44 unless I needed to have a beard, which I mean, I have a red beard. So who am I blending in with
00:53:57.44 --> 00:54:03.52 Russians or Irish? You know, I mean, like, I'm in Iraq. You know, I'm in like a bright blue eyes and a red beard.
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:08.40 Oh, it must be a local. Oh, like, so being attacked by leopard. Yeah.
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:14.64 Chewing it. That's a giant tattooed leopard cons. And so, you know, we just shaved heads and got
00:54:14.64 --> 00:54:21.76 after it. And I mean, you know, like why? It doesn't matter. That doesn't make you a less
00:54:21.76 --> 00:54:26.24 effective, you know, either way. You know, and you could tell that, you know, you could flip side that.
00:54:26.24 --> 00:54:30.64 The other way is like, hey, well, if I'm long hair and beard, what does that matter? It really doesn't.
00:54:30.64 --> 00:54:36.08 But it's the army's battle space. And we respected and loved those guys. They were phenomenal
00:54:36.08 --> 00:54:41.44 guys to work for. So why are we going to do something that is just to pass them off? You know,
00:54:41.44 --> 00:54:45.52 why? Who cares? Like, so we just shaved and, you know, how to keep their heads shaved,
00:54:45.52 --> 00:54:50.08 which is awesome, actually, because your, your helmet stuck to that like a little broo-up hat.
00:54:50.08 --> 00:54:54.96 And I didn't move around a lot. And, you know, and then the Marines that were with this
00:54:54.96 --> 00:54:59.04 Anglical guys, those phenomenal guys, you know, they started doing the same thing. They were shaving
00:54:59.04 --> 00:55:04.24 their heads and my boy Nick Hobbs, you know, he was with us. He's out. He's an awesome stud
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:09.28 Marine. And, you know, we always joke about he's like, man, like, he's, I just remember like this,
00:55:09.28 --> 00:55:13.44 we all like just would hang out in our free time. And he's like, you come really close with somebody
00:55:13.44 --> 00:55:17.84 when they're standing in there like boxer breeds and you're having to pour water over them
00:55:17.84 --> 00:55:23.04 for them to shower. And we're up on the rooftop right? Like doing bottles of water shower. And it's just
00:55:23.04 --> 00:55:30.80 just funny man, like I miss those days. Yeah. Yeah. And just so everybody knows now, I mean,
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:36.56 just to kind of give an overview if you don't know what the, what the overall operations that
00:55:36.56 --> 00:55:41.92 were taking place were pushing in the camp carregador, which we've been talking about, which is
00:55:41.92 --> 00:55:47.36 where this building full metal jacket was was on Eastern Ramadi. And the first the 506 was
00:55:47.36 --> 00:55:52.16 responsible for the Eastern Carter Ramadi, the really the southeast, turned in some other sections,
00:55:52.16 --> 00:55:59.28 but where the seal platoon was or the seal squad now is basically a smaller group as a
00:55:59.28 --> 00:56:04.24 work and was inside this area called the Malab district. And as the first the 506 would do
00:56:04.24 --> 00:56:10.000 big clearance operations. You guys would go out and primarily do sniper over watch. Although you,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.60 of course, you did, you did all their stuff, you did clearances and all that, but the primary
00:56:13.60 --> 00:56:18.80 mission, thank God you went to sniper school because you were the lead sniper and you did a lot of
00:56:18.80 --> 00:56:24.08 sniper work over there. Yeah, it was awesome. We got just right place right time, you know,
00:56:24.08 --> 00:56:30.88 it was just a thought I can really explain. Yeah. Now we worked to get work and we, you know,
00:56:30.88 --> 00:56:36.64 we pushed the envelope constantly, but we were no better than anybody over there, just we were
00:56:36.64 --> 00:56:41.52 just hungry, you know, we wanted it so bad. And I remember when we showed up there,
00:56:41.52 --> 00:56:48.56 the Colonel, you know, won't say his name, but he was awesome, you know, I mean,
00:56:48.56 --> 00:56:54.64 I was she was running for president. Absolutely. I would vote for him and obviously I would vote
00:56:54.64 --> 00:56:59.68 for him instantly. Yeah. He was just unbelievable. Go to campaign trail. Yeah, I can a heartbeat.
00:56:59.68 --> 00:57:06.000 No doubt. No doubt. Anyways, awesome guy and, you know, you talk about communication from
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.24 leadership. You talk about a guy that say his name, by the way. He's a general now. He, it's,
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:16.88 it's very obvious who it is, the commander of the first the 506 during the battle of Ramadi.
00:57:16.88 --> 00:57:23.84 Okay. A guy by the name of Ronald Clark. Ron Clark was just unbelievable leader and,
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:32.56 yeah, just an unbelievable leader. Ron Clark 2020. Yeah. But, awesome, awesome guy, but he,
00:57:32.56 --> 00:57:37.76 you know, he had the ability to communicate with us where we wanted to help him. Of course.
00:57:37.76 --> 00:57:42.80 And he was just like, hey, guys, I need help, you know, that's one thing I learned later on
00:57:42.80 --> 00:57:46.72 a life is like, when I was doing sales, I'm like, people don't want to be helped, but they want to
00:57:46.72 --> 00:57:50.88 help. And he knew that, you know, and so he's like, guys, I need help. We're losing guys every day.
00:57:50.88 --> 00:57:55.20 This is what we're going on. Hey, here's your R always. Please go get some. And we're like,
00:57:56.40 --> 00:58:01.68 yes, like this is it. And we had that connection with them. And, you know, just being able to go out and
00:58:01.68 --> 00:58:08.64 work for them was phenomenal. Yeah. And just, just awesome. I mean, the Delta Poutine Commander
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:17.28 formed such a good relationship with those guys and was, and you know, my relationship with him.
00:58:17.28 --> 00:58:27.20 Yeah. I mean, he was just solid dude and wanted to get after it. Yes, wanted to get after it
00:58:27.20 --> 00:58:34.96 as much as humanly possible. Yeah. And then some and then a little bit more, yeah, and with a little bit more on top of that.
00:58:34.96 --> 00:58:41.44 Right. So yeah, it was great. Great combination. And you actually, you did a lot of those operations too. So yeah,
00:58:41.44 --> 00:58:46.48 kind of the standard, we called standard. It wasn't that standard at the time. They time presence
00:58:46.48 --> 00:58:52.32 which rolls get some. No, and when I did that, I cared the mark 46. Oh, five, five, six belt
00:58:52.32 --> 00:58:57.20 fed action. And it was awesome. You know, you have two on a round of the gun. And I threw another 800
00:58:57.20 --> 00:59:04.56 rounds on my front. I had another 200 in the back. So 12 on a round with body armor, grenades,
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:08.000 smokes, water. And that's when I was, when I said that story to the beginning, he's like,
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.16 one of those first big operations we did out there. And that's where that's where that's from.
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:17.60 That's where that memory's from to see you walk and you're being okay. Guess all those way that he
00:59:17.60 --> 00:59:21.92 acted during training with paintball. He's gonna act the same way right here with his life on the
00:59:21.92 --> 00:59:26.80 line. Either walk, it was cool because I either walked a point or rear security because I was
00:59:26.80 --> 00:59:30.80 a machine gunner. You know, and you want a machine gun up front and you want one on the back
00:59:30.80 --> 00:59:35.28 because they're coming from the rear. I just remember that, you know, first push that you were
00:59:35.28 --> 00:59:41.92 talking about the first real firefighter got into just cut these dudes at half. And it was awesome.
00:59:42.80 --> 00:59:48.08 And, you know, everything that Colonel told us was gonna happen happened. Hey, usually within this
00:59:48.08 --> 00:59:52.48 amount of time, friend, they start coming out. Here's what they do. They come around the corner,
00:59:52.48 --> 00:59:56.32 then they distract you and they do this. And this is when they attack happens. And like,
00:59:57.04 --> 01:00:01.84 like, luck work. I mean, these savages were just coming out as exactly how we were told it was
01:00:01.84 --> 01:00:06.32 gonna come out as. Yeah. And that I think that helped us gain even more respect for the army that
01:00:06.32 --> 01:00:10.24 we worked for because they could have just been like, hey, go get some, but they're like, hey,
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:14.88 go get someone come back. So you can continue getting something. Yeah, know that the turnover
01:00:14.88 --> 01:00:18.64 that we would get from those guys was phenomenal. And the professionalism that they had like what
01:00:18.64 --> 01:00:25.76 you're talking about, like the Charlie Company commander, crazy Joe. Yeah. And he was freaking awesome.
01:00:26.40 --> 01:00:30.40 And one of the things that he would do, and this is when I said, oh, he this guy is all the next level.
01:00:30.40 --> 01:00:35.12 He's doing something that I never even thought of every time he went on patrol in the Malab.
01:00:35.12 --> 01:00:39.68 He was recording it. He was video recording it. And then he'd come back and review every street
01:00:39.68 --> 01:00:46.000 corner, every building, every signpost. He knew everything about it. You know, that city. He took his job
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000 like so seriously down. It was, it was phenomenal. I remember the Delta Poutine commander had told me
01:00:52.64 --> 01:00:59.28 that he was doing that or we knew that. And it really emphasized us to, hey, we need to know
01:00:59.28 --> 01:01:05.68 this area just as well. And I mean, it didn't take long. I'm not trying to be cocky or anything,
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:10.88 but within a couple weeks, like I didn't need my map. Like I knew that city. You know, I mean,
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:14.64 like, now I had the map on me too. So if I needed to look at it and be like, oh, I'm at this building.
01:01:14.64 --> 01:01:20.32 Hey, we're pushing over here. So I can scan real quick and go. But like I knew exactly where
01:01:20.32 --> 01:01:25.12 I was at all times because I, those guys did. And we needed to know that you can't have a delay in
01:01:25.12 --> 01:01:29.68 communication when you're in a firefight, you know, or, you know, or guys are down, you know,
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:36.48 and there's just, and I went, you know, just, I heard it over the radio and Cowie got shot. Just,
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:42.96 like, I'll never forget that, you know. And knowing exactly where they're at. And there's a
01:01:42.96 --> 01:01:46.80 little confusion leaving. And I was like, no, we need to go this way. I would generally just
01:01:46.80 --> 01:01:52.16 start running that way, you know, because you just hear Mikey opening up and the badgers trying
01:01:52.16 --> 01:01:56.32 to pull him out. You just, your boys are in a firefight and you just don't know what's going to happen.
01:01:56.32 --> 01:02:01.28 And we're trying to get there as fast as we could and it was just like, we got, I mean, we
01:02:01.28 --> 01:02:06.48 legitimately got there as fast as we could. And it was because we knew we had to be prepared, you know.
01:02:06.48 --> 01:02:11.04 And could you imagine if we didn't know where exactly they were or where we were and you're
01:02:11.04 --> 01:02:14.40 sitting there like, trying to listen to a map, you know, read a map when you hear your boy
01:02:14.40 --> 01:02:19.44 over the radio, like, have been shot and shot and you just hear huge machine gun just going off
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:25.60 and you're just like, like, but the boys were with, that's between commander, the breath,
01:02:25.60 --> 01:02:29.44 JP, where we, you know, he knew we were out, but he's like, hey, where do we need to go? You know,
01:02:29.44 --> 01:02:33.68 exactly. And you know, because he's a, he could have gotten us there, but he wanted me to
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:37.28 guess there because I was, no, that's the point. He could write all the things. He doesn't need to be
01:02:37.28 --> 01:02:41.84 worried about that because he's working too radio, trying to get in cat, you know, he's got to
01:02:41.84 --> 01:02:46.24 figure out, like, hey, let's get some tanks in here to mow the city down to get our boy out
01:02:46.24 --> 01:02:50.64 and get them to the hospital, you know, and so the story that JP's talking about right there
01:02:50.64 --> 01:02:54.88 is like, that's first significant gazzle that we had. We had some other guys get fragged a little bit,
01:02:54.88 --> 01:03:01.84 but that was the first one, uh, Kawi, yeah, and Kawi got shot and uh, about losses like, they were
01:03:01.84 --> 01:03:11.28 able to save it now. He's a stud, yeah, still, you know, but uh, she was, she is, or lepros don't
01:03:11.28 --> 01:03:17.68 lose their spots. Yeah, no doubt. He's still warrior inside and out, solid. Yeah, he's a guy that
01:03:17.68 --> 01:03:21.68 tells the story about where, like, when I want to see him in Charlie Medseries all morphed
01:03:21.68 --> 01:03:28.40 up, we rolled in there and I like went to shake his hand, like a bro handshake and in like when
01:03:28.40 --> 01:03:34.24 I grabbed, he reached up, he grabbed my hand and he like pulls me down, right? And he, and he, and he's like,
01:03:34.24 --> 01:03:42.56 in my ear, and he goes, let me stay. Oh yeah, he was, I'm like, I'm like, hey bro, you're about to lose your life.
01:03:42.56 --> 01:03:46.88 I, I didn't tell him that, but I was like, hey bro, let's make sure you get healed up and
01:03:46.88 --> 01:03:53.12 I think you're gonna have to leave. And he's like, just, he's like, let me stay because I don't care.
01:03:53.12 --> 01:03:58.64 I'll, I'll, I'll all, all clean, you know, but this let me stay. And I was like, bro, we're uh,
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:04.000 it's just going healed up. If you have to go, go, go, heal up, we'll bring it back. And of course
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.52 he and he'll up fast enough because it was pretty jacked up. He got a armor piercing round. It's like the
01:04:07.52 --> 01:04:12.32 entered like down by his knee and exited up by his growing. Yeah, they hit the femur right. Yeah,
01:04:12.32 --> 01:04:17.04 just travel. I mean, he's nasty. He's lucky. He has like, absolutely. He's a legitimate lucky. So
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.60 I've got to get him on the podcast. I'm done. His whole life is awesome. All right. Well, you know what,
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:28.72 you know what, I was thinking there's one more up that I was thinking of besides the kind of urban
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:34.32 sniper operations you were doing. Yeah, and presence patrols. You need to cool up that was a little
01:04:34.32 --> 01:04:40.000 bit more like, late for an hour is talking about how, oh, you know what, you know, it's not like
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.60 you're seeing the movies because with these sniper overwatch positions, we'd have a bunch of people with us.
01:04:43.60 --> 01:04:49.12 You know, we have 20, 15, 20, 10, 30 people. You have a lot of people to be in these buildings and
01:04:49.12 --> 01:04:54.16 hold security and all that. It was as in the movies they always portray like two guys out in the middle of
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:59.12 nowhere. And we always go, yeah, no, that's not that realistic. But you guys actually did go and
01:04:59.12 --> 01:05:08.56 all that. Yeah, we did. It was fun. It was pretty awesome. Yeah, so up in northern Sofia, we're getting
01:05:08.56 --> 01:05:13.28 just hammered by mortars, you know, just constantly. We knew that's where they're coming from.
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:22.80 So we get dropped off a little outstation north of, you know, the Milab district and we just did a
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:28.48 patrol. It was a long patrol up there. And remember, you know, we're, you know, hugging the river,
01:05:28.48 --> 01:05:34.40 trying to stay as close to the river as we can. It's, you know, you go from the drive to dead city to
01:05:34.40 --> 01:05:41.76 this lush vegetation and you're trying to patrol through that. I'm just like, oh, dude, hands, like,
01:05:41.76 --> 01:05:47.76 all the guys in Vietnam, all those guys like just got off to it. Like, I've always respected them. But
01:05:47.76 --> 01:05:53.92 that just brought a new level of respect. Like, we have night vision. They didn't. They're nice and
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:57.68 tired. You know, I was just like, and it is, it is hard for everyone to understand that that area
01:05:57.68 --> 01:06:03.84 north of Ramadi that was like well, irrigated by the river by the refugees. Yeah, it looked like
01:06:03.84 --> 01:06:09.84 Vietnam. Yeah. They had palm trees. It had like patties and dikes and all that stuff. It looked like
01:06:09.84 --> 01:06:15.84 Vietnam. Yeah. And Laf we're talking about the other days. Like, there was like the bull pulling a
01:06:15.84 --> 01:06:21.68 plow type situation straight up. Look like Vietnam. Yeah. It was crazy. So anyways, we go up there
01:06:21.68 --> 01:06:30.32 and mad, it was, we had dogs that were following us. So I can't say his name is still in, but he always
01:06:30.32 --> 01:06:39.92 he carried a suppressed MP5 with subsonic rounds. So he was our dog killer. And that was pretty funny.
01:06:39.92 --> 01:06:47.76 And so he just, you know, these are bad savage dogs. And so we're getting up there, you know,
01:06:47.76 --> 01:06:53.60 barking given away our location. So we, you know, handle them, we keep going. And we get set up at night,
01:06:53.60 --> 01:06:58.56 you know, we get all OPs set up and, you know, we're right on the river. Like, that's around the river
01:06:58.56 --> 01:07:02.72 because we, you know, if we need the boats to come in support us, they can come in. We can get fast.
01:07:02.72 --> 01:07:11.52 That's extra out of there. And, you know, so I mean the badger, we, you know, we have changed out into all of our stuff.
01:07:11.52 --> 01:07:18.24 You know, like we're, we're caring gear for like three or four days, right? Like, it's almost physically impossible to carry that much water.
01:07:18.24 --> 01:07:25.60 Like, and all your ammo and everything else like that. And so we get it done and we change out,
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:31.12 get on our guillotine suits. And I just remember like thinking like, dude, this is like, yes, it's it.
01:07:31.12 --> 01:07:35.76 Like, you see like the ambient light coming in through the trees where we're all like hidden and
01:07:35.76 --> 01:07:41.44 veged up in the guys who set their perimeter. We're in our, we're in our guillotine suits. And we just,
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:45.60 boom, and one of the other guys like to use awesome, you know, guys are there and we're turning around.
01:07:45.60 --> 01:07:50.64 He goes, and you go to gone. Like you just disappeared in the dark and, you know, we wouldn't
01:07:50.64 --> 01:07:57.28 got set up, you know. And like I said, you know, the badger was, you know, he was a sniper before,
01:07:57.28 --> 01:08:01.84 you know, so I learned a lot from him. And but this time we both had a good amount of experience of
01:08:01.84 --> 01:08:07.92 actually on the gun and whatnot. And so he was, you know, no, no ego with them. You know, he was just so like
01:08:07.92 --> 01:08:11.60 easy back. He's like, man, this is what we're going to do. What do you think? I'm like, yeah, let's do it.
01:08:11.60 --> 01:08:15.12 And then there's a, I'm like, hey, maybe we should change up that. He's like, all right, yeah, let's do that.
01:08:15.12 --> 01:08:23.12 And so we end up veging up in this area that I mean, it was the only the opportunity for where we had to be,
01:08:23.12 --> 01:08:29.52 wasn't ideal, you know. We legitimately were on the other side of these bushes out in the open.
01:08:29.52 --> 01:08:36.08 It was like thick bushes around us. So we could wedge up and blend in, but we were out there by ourselves.
01:08:36.08 --> 01:08:40.16 And we knew that. And we had after we did a recon, we told the guys, okay, this is the only place we can go.
01:08:40.16 --> 01:08:45.20 This is what you really like the only place we can go to be able to, you know, get these guys. And so our
01:08:45.20 --> 01:08:49.60 contingency is if something happened, we're going to have to wait a while before the guys could actually
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:54.48 move to a position to provide cover fire and, you know, everything else like that. And we're like,
01:08:54.48 --> 01:08:59.60 all right, cool, you know, not a big deal. Yeah. And so like, cool, we have our pistols and sniper rifles,
01:08:59.60 --> 01:09:04.40 you know what I mean? And so we go off, we get veged up, we, you know, help veging each other, get ourselves
01:09:04.40 --> 01:09:09.28 into position, raffles are laying like kind of underneath the, the drag bags, which are veged up.
01:09:09.28 --> 01:09:14.000 And we had our pistols out just because I mean, there's, I don't know, people can't see us right now,
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.28 but there's the distance from me to you. We had people walking past us. And it was just one of those things.
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:24.64 So three, four, five meters away. Yeah, five meters. There's, there's people walking by. Yeah,
01:09:24.64 --> 01:09:28.64 just walking by us. And we're out there, you know, all throughout the night, the day, you know,
01:09:28.64 --> 01:09:33.12 it's one of those things. We're like, I have to pee. You know, you're not trying to drink too much water.
01:09:33.12 --> 01:09:38.32 You don't have to use it by the same time. You're like, it's hot. So I need to luckily, since it is that hot,
01:09:38.32 --> 01:09:42.56 you're in a gilly suit, you're sweat most of it out anyways, but, you know, cold time to add a piece.
01:09:42.56 --> 01:09:48.80 So you like slightly roll over, dig a hole, relieve yourself, cover back up, and lay back on top of it,
01:09:48.80 --> 01:09:56.000 you know, and it was good though. You know, we actually got, got mordered at that position.
01:09:56.72 --> 01:10:04.24 And we, we got lucky. You know, we definitely had our angels there because, you know, it messed up
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:10.96 our radios temporarily. And everything around us was just kind of tore up. Look, all the bushes
01:10:10.96 --> 01:10:16.16 and everything. And we didn't get hit by one thing. And, you know, it was just like, hey, what
01:10:16.16 --> 01:10:22.48 would we do? Do we stay here? Do we move them? Well, our radios rejected up. So, you know, luckily,
01:10:22.48 --> 01:10:26.96 you know, they didn't move us, you know, it's starting to lay down, cover fire while we're trying
01:10:26.96 --> 01:10:32.08 to move back to them. So we just waited a little bit, make sure like we weren't trying to get
01:10:32.08 --> 01:10:37.12 suckered out, you know, ambushed or anything. And then we just slowly made our way back to the
01:10:37.12 --> 01:10:41.52 group. We told what happened. I mean, dude, me and him were pretty jacked up from that. Like, we're
01:10:41.52 --> 01:10:47.68 thrown up like just the blast and everything else. Like, 120s, you think? I did honest, I have no idea.
01:10:47.68 --> 01:10:52.72 There's a couple of them. But like, if they rocked you that hard, then they were big. We were throwing
01:10:52.72 --> 01:11:00.24 up the whole patrol back. Oh, and we were all throwing up. We evolved, we were all tabled in our
01:11:00.24 --> 01:11:05.60 urine and stool after that. And it was just, I mean, I was, but you know, whatever. I mean,
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:12.32 we got the guys and, you know, we called in counter stuff and we came back and everyone was happy
01:11:12.32 --> 01:11:16.56 because they didn't get more the base thing getting harder for a while. So I remember after that,
01:11:16.56 --> 01:11:22.64 the laundry guys, you know, these guys were like doing a laundry. Like, they're so stoked that we did
01:11:22.64 --> 01:11:27.60 that. We're like, man, we were stoked. We got to do that, you know, the name, that's awesome.
01:11:27.60 --> 01:11:32.16 They would come and like, come and pick up our laundry for us and we're like, dude, oh, we're good.
01:11:32.16 --> 01:11:37.84 Like, this is awkward. Like, you know, I mean, like, you know, go pick up your boys, laundry. Like,
01:11:37.84 --> 01:11:41.44 we're, we're good. But it was, it was really cool to be able to do that. You know, something completely
01:11:41.44 --> 01:11:47.04 outside the box that we hadn't been doing the whole time. So we were able to go from, and it just came
01:11:47.04 --> 01:11:51.60 from good planning. We had, like I said, we had solid leadership. So we had a good plans in place.
01:11:51.60 --> 01:12:00.000 Yeah. Yeah. And it was the amount of sustained combat operations for the whole past,
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.56 it was was, was damn. It was an incredible opt-up. Yeah. It was just like, up, up, up, up,
01:12:08.56 --> 01:12:14.08 every day to one unit, two unit, three elements going out for us. It's all the time. Yeah.
01:12:14.08 --> 01:12:30.48 So we start getting towards the end of this deployment. And obviously, Mark got killed on August 2nd.
01:12:30.48 --> 01:12:45.76 And, and then September 29th, Mike, you get killed. Yeah. And we're, I mean, we're,
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:53.52 we're not done operating by any stretch because we get a bunch more operations. But it was definitely winding
01:12:53.52 --> 01:13:01.84 down at that point. Yeah. We had to start thinking about redeployment. Yeah. And, uh, I mean,
01:13:01.84 --> 01:13:07.20 we're all packed up. I remember because we weren't out at, uh, at a regular anymore. Yeah. We had
01:13:07.20 --> 01:13:11.60 guys that were, you were one of the guys that had come back from Craig Doris. We started trying to
01:13:11.60 --> 01:13:16.72 filter guys back. I was solid. So mad at it. Come back. You know, I think about every day when I
01:13:16.72 --> 01:13:22.56 filled this finger, because like, you know, I cut my finger down to the bone. And, uh, they actually had to
01:13:22.56 --> 01:13:27.36 cause back me out, uh, to go get surgery on my finger because I thought I was going to lose it. Because
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.08 we tried to work on it across the street at the aid station, which those guys are phenomenal,
01:13:32.08 --> 01:13:37.12 combat medics over there. And when they were like, dude, we need a bird for you. You're going to lose your
01:13:37.12 --> 01:13:43.52 finger, um, the multiple-tune commander and the badger were like, dude, we out. Yeah, absolutely.
01:13:43.52 --> 01:13:48.88 You know, so I went back, wrapped some gear. And, um, yeah, I feel that every day.
01:13:53.76 --> 01:13:59.12 Well, just hard, um, like that was the only op I wasn't on. You know, every time we went out,
01:13:59.12 --> 01:14:03.04 I was set a group prayer for the guys. It didn't matter if it was like, hey, we have to go
01:14:03.04 --> 01:14:07.44 right now. The hospital didn't come under or the badger or somewhere to that, hey, we got to get
01:14:07.44 --> 01:14:12.56 JP real quick. And I'd say a group prayer and we'd roll. And that was the only one that I wasn't
01:14:12.56 --> 01:14:19.12 a part of. And, uh, you know, my IQ was my ADUP Gunner. You know, he was always next me when I was
01:14:19.12 --> 01:14:25.12 doing my sniper overwatches. And he was next me when I was rocking point, you know, because you need
01:14:25.12 --> 01:14:29.20 to ADUP Gunner. And JP might have gotten a little crazy towards the last half of the deployment and
01:14:29.20 --> 01:14:35.92 started to walk in point with 300 win mag. And my IQ was there. And I wasn't there, you know. And
01:14:35.92 --> 01:14:47.68 I don't know. So, well, the good news is you got to go home with them. Yes, yeah, got to
01:14:48.40 --> 01:14:59.36 escort his body home. Which was, unlike anything else, you know, you're like, cool. You know,
01:14:59.36 --> 01:15:04.16 you get to be a part of that. But also the same time, you like, this is really shitty to be a part
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:09.28 of, you know what I mean? I don't know. It was like, yeah, I wanted to be there and make sure everything
01:15:09.28 --> 01:15:17.76 went well. And I just remember us flying back and just just staring at the flag over his coffin,
01:15:17.76 --> 01:15:23.52 you know. And some guys would, you know, lay next to the casket. We lean up against it.
01:15:23.52 --> 01:15:36.80 Yeah, it was just getting bring him home was important to be a part of that. But, you know,
01:15:36.80 --> 01:15:43.76 everybody felt so much guilt. And we all try to keep each other accountable on that. You know,
01:15:43.76 --> 01:15:51.92 it's like, amen. This is a war. You know, Mike, you saved a lot of lives. You know. And we made an impact
01:15:51.92 --> 01:15:59.92 over there. And so it wasn't like it was for nothing. And what he did, I mean, the guy's lives that he
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:07.44 saved, they all now have families and kids, you know, a couple of them had kids. Mike had the
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:15.44 easy out. And just like he always did, he never took the easy road. He took the harder road. The road
01:16:15.44 --> 01:16:21.36 that would actually make a difference. And this time was a life of those, of those guys around him.
01:16:21.36 --> 01:16:31.12 And it was just the ride back. I mean, you just think about all that. And yeah, it was also kind of a
01:16:31.12 --> 01:16:36.64 blur as well. You know, like I remember, you know, just like just rubbing the flag, you know.
01:16:39.68 --> 01:16:44.40 The flag's always been very important to me. I remember graduating how we can just sing the
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:51.60 flag fly and then you hear it in the national anthem. And just sing it over one of your boy's
01:16:52.32 --> 01:16:59.12 caskets was just brought a new level of connection and love for that amazing flag that we have.
01:17:00.40 --> 01:17:07.52 And I sure, I just out there. I just would just rub the flag, just rub it, you know, because I had
01:17:07.52 --> 01:17:12.96 flags that I carried with me on every deployment, every mission. I still do that sometimes. Like my
01:17:12.96 --> 01:17:18.48 wife Amanda will just I'll be doing something and I'll find a flag and I'll just kind of rub it.
01:17:19.04 --> 01:17:23.36 And she's like she knows, you know, she's like that's like my little trigger, you know, I'm just
01:17:23.36 --> 01:17:30.32 my trigger point. I'm just, I just started thinking about things again. And you know, I've taught my kids
01:17:31.60 --> 01:17:39.68 Aiden, Korra and Nola to love and respect the flag. Like whenever they see a flag, they're like
01:17:39.68 --> 01:17:44.88 Daddy, Daddy, it's your favorite thing. Daddy is Daddy's favorite thing, you know, they love
01:17:44.88 --> 01:17:50.08 getting American flag t-shirts and shorts. They saw some American flag cowboy boots. Of course,
01:17:50.08 --> 01:17:57.52 my daughters want those now. And I've been honest with my kids, you know, my boy Aiden, I call my
01:17:57.52 --> 01:18:04.40 bonus boy. He's my stepson, I love him just like mine. You know, he asked me about the flag and
01:18:04.40 --> 01:18:09.20 why is it so important to me. And I told him, I'm like, you know, it was it's been draped over a lot of
01:18:09.20 --> 01:18:15.12 caskets of my buddies that didn't make it home that were killed overseas. He's such a special kid.
01:18:15.12 --> 01:18:22.88 He was just like, that makes sense. And, you know, he just he's a flag and I explained to him why
01:18:22.88 --> 01:18:28.16 flags at half mass. And he's even said, hey, I'm sorry, that flags at half mass. I can't
01:18:28.16 --> 01:18:33.52 he doesn't know why, but he knows something happened. And he knows what it does to me and guys like you,
01:18:33.52 --> 01:18:39.52 whatever, the flags at half mass something horrible has happened. And he knows that. You know, and so
01:18:40.40 --> 01:18:49.92 I just remember, you know, we, I think he went to bestead Bethesda and then we continued on to San Diego.
01:18:51.52 --> 01:18:56.88 And just tried to mentally reset for a couple of days, you know, your back in San Diego.
01:18:56.88 --> 01:19:05.92 So it's awesome, but it just didn't, you know, because you knew you're waiting to receive your
01:19:05.92 --> 01:19:11.84 one of your boys' bodies, you know. So it didn't matter where we were. It didn't matter where
01:19:11.84 --> 01:19:20.000 in San Diego. Like, we didn't want to be in San Diego. We want to be back overseas, still, you know.
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:32.48 And when we went to Habanía to put him on the bird. And
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:57.20 he was open. Yeah. And we were just finally in by. And I remember you were ahead of me. We're
01:19:57.20 --> 01:20:03.84 walking into like a mil van. It wasn't like a one way thing. It was a cold mil van. It's a cold mil van.
01:20:04.64 --> 01:20:12.000 And you were ahead of me. You were one, you're literally right ahead of me. And you walked in.
01:20:13.04 --> 01:20:18.72 And you know, you, you, you know, you took your last look at Mikey, you put your hand on the
01:20:18.72 --> 01:20:26.000 on the casket. And you turned around and I was right, you know, we were just looking at each other.
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:48.96 And when I saw your face, the looking your face, I was, I felt super worried
01:20:48.96 --> 01:21:00.40 about you because I could tell that you were tore up. And I said to myself, hey, man,
01:21:01.20 --> 01:21:05.76 Jaco, you need to get your fucking game together right now and be strong.
01:21:05.76 --> 01:21:17.44 And you were. And that's what we needed. And guys like the Delta Platoon Commander,
01:21:19.20 --> 01:21:23.52 super, super strong for us. But you saw them. I mean, everybody's hurting, you know, it was,
01:21:24.24 --> 01:21:28.72 you know, that deployment you can't not be close with somebody, you know, and especially someone
01:21:28.72 --> 01:21:35.28 like Mikey, man, like he, he knows I liked my sleep. And so he would make sure I didn't get my sleep.
01:21:36.08 --> 01:21:42.48 Just because Mikey didn't sleep. And we were, you know, we were everyone's right next to each other.
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:45.60 You know, I was back in this corner, he was over in this other corner. There's a sheet of
01:21:45.60 --> 01:21:50.96 plywood between the two of us. And you know, he was always like, what's up homes? He's like,
01:21:50.96 --> 01:21:58.88 okay, homes is sleeping. I'm like, yeah, I'm trying to homes. He's like, he's like cool. He'd open up the
01:21:58.88 --> 01:22:04.88 tarp, you know, the little candy, you know, tarp that I had over for my door and just come in and
01:22:04.88 --> 01:22:10.64 sound the edge of the bed. I'm like, what's up, buddy? He's like, nothing. Just want, you know,
01:22:10.64 --> 01:22:15.44 he just talked about family stuff and you could tell that was always on his mind. You know,
01:22:15.44 --> 01:22:22.08 and he's like, hey, you want to watch the newest episode of thirsty traveler? All right,
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:27.92 that means a thirsty traveler. I was like, no, but I'm awake. So I guess we're going to watch
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:32.000 the thirsty traveler because there's a couple times where I play a cable. I'm trying to sleep,
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.80 like, just go do your own thing, you know what I mean? And he had a little hole that he carved into
01:22:36.80 --> 01:22:43.28 the plywood between our rooms. And he would crack Kim lights and push them through. They'd fall
01:22:43.28 --> 01:22:47.92 right next to where I was sleeping. You know, I'm like, I'm going to sprinkle this guy,
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:53.36 but it was my boy, my key, you know? Like, it was my boy. You know, we were close in the
01:22:53.36 --> 01:23:00.40 work up. And then obviously, you know, we should ride three bikes together. And anyway, so deployment
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:05.20 he was just fun. I just, I say all that said, is he did that with everybody? Yeah. It was hard
01:23:05.20 --> 01:23:10.64 not to be close to him. It was, you know, there's a different connection when you're at,
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:16.40 when you're legitimately at in war with your boys. You know, that's why all the army and marine
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:21.68 guys that we've served with, like, in time I see, I still see some of them once in a while. I randomly
01:23:21.68 --> 01:23:27.28 ran into one of them up in Ohio. And I was just like, dude. And I just, I was up there on a
01:23:27.28 --> 01:23:31.04 cell strip and I just ditched myself, same guys. You know, because I wanted to hang out with them,
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:35.92 you know, I just, and there's been other trips where I, same thing, another one, my boy Nick
01:23:35.92 --> 01:23:40.000 Hobbs, you know, ran into him. I was with my cell steam and I was like, come on, you know, it's just,
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.60 just that connection is just, it's hard to explain. I mean, you guys know how it is doing
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:47.92 you just to combat sports where you're wrong with guys and you, you legitimately, you're helping
01:23:47.92 --> 01:23:51.76 guys cut weight and just all this stuff. Like, there's that bond in that connection.
01:23:52.80 --> 01:23:58.000 Take that times up by a thousand and then add some more and that's the connection you get with
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.56 these boys and calm that. So it's just real hard. I mean, in part of it is, that's just who I am.
01:24:04.56 --> 01:24:09.76 Like, I, I remember my heart and my sleeve. I just connect and attach to people very closely and,
01:24:09.76 --> 01:24:15.92 you know, my key is just, it was, it was really hard and that's the look that I saw in your face.
01:24:16.48 --> 01:24:21.04 That's the look that I saw in your face. I was like, and I know, I mean, obviously, I know what
01:24:21.04 --> 01:24:26.56 kind of personality you have. I knew what kind of personality you have and I saw that look of
01:24:26.56 --> 01:24:31.12 devastation. And it was the first time because we'd been together. I mean, we, we were, we heard the news.
01:24:31.12 --> 01:24:35.36 We, you know, but it was the first time that I saw your, your look, where it was almost like that
01:24:35.36 --> 01:24:41.20 was the first time that you really realized that Mike, he was gone. That was it. Yeah. I'm right
01:24:41.20 --> 01:24:49.44 around. But no, I'm the look in your face. I was like, okay, he is, he is devastated right now.
01:24:49.44 --> 01:24:56.56 And that's what I thought to myself. And again, I mean, I, I don't, I saw you as my little brother.
01:24:56.56 --> 01:25:02.56 I mean, for sure, I don't mean that in any kind of derogatory way in any sense. But I literally saw
01:25:02.56 --> 01:25:08.08 you as like my blood, little brother. Yeah. And so to see you just devastated like that.
01:25:08.48 --> 01:25:12.96 And I knew that you were looking at me like, well, okay, what's Jocco gonna do? And I knew that
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:18.40 I knew what I had to do was I had to show like, listen, this is what we do. This is who we are.
01:25:18.96 --> 01:25:25.52 Get your shit together, Jocco. And, and handle this. And, not saying I didn't, you know,
01:25:25.52 --> 01:25:33.52 I'm not saying I was a robot. But I knew that I had to maintain strength. You have to
01:25:33.52 --> 01:25:40.40 define that so that you guys could go, all right, we're gonna be okay. What have we, what's been
01:25:41.44 --> 01:25:47.76 pounded in termine since, but when the fight, like, if you're gonna fight, when the fight,
01:25:47.76 --> 01:25:52.48 when the fire fight, right? And right then that our fight was, you had to keep the guys together.
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:56.72 You know, that's why I thought it was self-adbuddied, right? You get shot, you get hurt,
01:25:56.72 --> 01:26:00.56 you take care of yourselves because if you're in a firefight, your boys are going to win the
01:26:00.56 --> 01:26:06.56 firefight first before they can take care of you. That's just part of it. That's how we operate.
01:26:06.56 --> 01:26:13.12 And you had to do that. You know, I mean, that you're in that highest leadership position,
01:26:14.32 --> 01:26:18.48 you just, and the same thing, like, I had to get myself together, you know, just because
01:26:18.48 --> 01:26:23.36 other guys in the boutune, like, I thought, I really felt like they looked up to me as well. And,
01:26:23.36 --> 01:26:27.12 you know, especially after that deployment, you know, I just, you had to keep yourself together, you know,
01:26:28.48 --> 01:26:33.44 I was just, it's just a weird, weird situation, you know, I was first time I ever experienced that,
01:26:33.44 --> 01:26:36.48 you know, at that level. So,
01:26:39.28 --> 01:26:47.04 no, and then, you know, obviously, Mike is feeling what you were at. I obviously wasn't there
01:26:47.04 --> 01:26:52.08 because like you said, we were still, you know, most of us were still in Iraq. Yeah. And had to
01:26:52.08 --> 01:26:57.12 had to finish out the deployment and do the turnover with the guys that were coming in from team five.
01:26:58.24 --> 01:27:04.40 And, you know, that was another thing was just, you know, I mean, I talked about all the time, like,
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:08.96 even when we were talking prior to recording today, you know, I was like, hey, this is,
01:27:09.84 --> 01:27:15.68 this is kind of blurry to me. Like, I was asking you who went home with you. I mean, I was, like,
01:27:15.68 --> 01:27:20.08 okay, you know, these guys are gone. Okay, here's what I got to do that and focus on the next thing. I, like,
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:25.84 couldn't get dragged down or think about that anymore because I had to, like you said, I had to do my
01:27:25.84 --> 01:27:32.64 work, I had to do my job. And, you know, I think that's the good thing is for guys that were
01:27:32.64 --> 01:27:36.24 able to go to the funeral and everything. It's like, you get to get to get that, like,
01:27:36.24 --> 01:27:40.16 bit of closure. Yeah. Well, a lot of, you know, the guys that were still over there, we were just,
01:27:40.16 --> 01:27:44.96 we didn't get that. You know, until we got home, yeah, we got home. And, you know, get to go see
01:27:44.96 --> 01:27:51.92 Mike, he's grave and, and meet with his family and get to know his family and get to be together,
01:27:51.92 --> 01:27:57.44 again, as a, as a trooping. So, all those things are kind of how you, you, you, you go from that
01:27:57.44 --> 01:28:04.40 anguish. Yeah. Well, I should say for me, the buried anguish of, you know, that you have to vary
01:28:04.40 --> 01:28:11.04 on deployment when you get home, you go, okay. Now, we can get this stuff out and discuss it. And at least,
01:28:11.04 --> 01:28:15.20 maybe not discuss it. I don't need to say anything to you, JP. I don't need to talk to you about it.
01:28:15.20 --> 01:28:22.24 You know, I know, but we can, we can settle it, you know, and I think when guys don't do that,
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:28.24 when guys don't think about it, when they keep it buried all the time, that's when it can be
01:28:28.24 --> 01:28:34.08 really problematic is, you know, you, you got to, you got to, you got to face the fact and you
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:40.000 got to be okay with it, eventually that, hey, this is what happened. Yeah. And, you know, when we're
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.72 talking about like, who's, I guess you could say, you know, who's to blame? And I told this to
01:28:47.68 --> 01:28:53.28 multiple people. Matter of fact, I told everybody, you want to blame somebody? You blame the
01:28:53.28 --> 01:28:58.16 fucking moust. Yeah. They're the ones that did this. Absolutely. Yeah. That's what happened. Yeah.
01:28:58.16 --> 01:29:02.40 And what we're going to do is concl more of them. Continue to go kill more of them. Yeah.
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:16.08 Yeah. So that deployment obviously was a, was a, was a game changer for us, for a huge impact
01:29:16.08 --> 01:29:22.56 on our lives and, and, you know, everything really that we're doing to this day. And you,
01:29:22.56 --> 01:29:28.72 you got home, I moved over to, you know, take over the training command there. You started another
01:29:28.72 --> 01:29:36.000 work up, but you got hurt. Yeah. So, you know, I was just, the desert, a smoked, you know, just,
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.08 you know, come home flat deployment, you know, initially just still kind of messed up. We're not
01:29:40.08 --> 01:29:44.72 still kind of, I was messed up with the whole Mikey thing. I remember I went and told Yarbara
01:29:44.72 --> 01:29:51.92 was a cat. I just want to go pick on like just let me reset. He's like, okay. And then he, he knows.
01:29:51.92 --> 01:29:56.16 And he knows me. He's like, all right, cool. Yeah. Roger that knowing that's not what he's going to
01:29:56.16 --> 01:30:02.96 do. And I'm driving back up to Sacramento on leave. He's like, hey, I know you said you want to go to
01:30:02.96 --> 01:30:09.36 pick on, but yeah, we need to get after it again. So you're going to go that rack again. Or
01:30:09.36 --> 01:30:14.16 our possibly have cast hand. I was like, get Roger that. Yeah, I don't even know why I said that.
01:30:14.16 --> 01:30:18.32 You know, like it was just as long as things were just like, you know, no good to be
01:30:18.32 --> 01:30:23.84 pick on. Go to Thailand. Stay in Delta, too. No, they switched it all up. So I remember that, but they
01:30:23.84 --> 01:30:30.88 were so surprised that stayed there. Yeah. So no, I was going to be. I'll for a problem too.
01:30:30.88 --> 01:30:37.44 So after our deployment with TU Ruser, they took it instead of keeping it together, because
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:42.16 there was all this experience in this two-partons instead of keeping it together, they just split
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:46.64 everybody apart in a different pattern. So other patterns would have these guys in their
01:30:46.64 --> 01:30:51.12 patterns with a ton of combat experience. Guided pest. Yeah, everyone was pest. Like, super
01:30:51.12 --> 01:30:59.44 pest. Yeah. So we start work up. And my shoulder out of joint, all right, one.
01:30:59.44 --> 01:31:03.12 I was a bad one. Not like I'd done that multiple times before. Like, I mean, we're out at
01:31:03.12 --> 01:31:08.40 Nylon. You know, doing our desert warfare, getting it on. And my shoulder came out and I just
01:31:08.40 --> 01:31:13.68 relocate the shoulder. And you know, so I cut off a little bit and keep going. And this was a bad one.
01:31:13.68 --> 01:31:18.48 And so, ended up having to have surgery. That's all right, cool. You know, you have surgery. You'll
01:31:18.48 --> 01:31:23.20 miss a little bit of work up. But, you know, we'll catch it up and we'll get going. And when I had surgery,
01:31:23.20 --> 01:31:28.88 they punctured my break on nerve or did some damage to it. So I would actually drop stuff.
01:31:29.76 --> 01:31:35.04 And, um, that can't be an activity. You put it on when you're dropping stuff. You know, randomly,
01:31:35.92 --> 01:31:39.84 because I was at rehab. And I just, I couldn't grab on to stuff or I would just drop stuff.
01:31:40.48 --> 01:31:47.04 So then they pulled me. And I went to Buds. Um, for a little bit as an endoc Instructor.
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:55.28 And, um, a good time over there. Learned a lot about, you know, just professionalism and,
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.52 you know, things change and evolve and, you know, um, so when I was a trade-up with you guys,
01:32:02.08 --> 01:32:08.64 and, um, you and, uh, Z, you guys pulled me over there. And it was awesome. You know,
01:32:08.64 --> 01:32:14.16 stepped into, uh, assaults. And then we're doing all the CCC and Error warfare training. And
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:20.80 trade-it was awesome. You know, I'm working for you again, which is, I'm like, yes, we're getting
01:32:20.80 --> 01:32:26.96 after as it should be. Yes, absolutely. And, um, I learned a lot at trade-it about
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:32.88 good leadership and bad leadership. You know, there's some guys that trade it, um, that
01:32:32.88 --> 01:32:38.80 hadn't really done anything. And, Jocco was pushing those guys out of there. Not in a bad way,
01:32:38.80 --> 01:32:44.000 but just like, hey man, like, you're not gonna, you know, the war's really being gone on for a while.
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.60 Training, you know, combat is getting intense. Training needs to be intense. And it needs to come
01:32:49.60 --> 01:32:55.20 from guys that actually have experience. Or are willing to listen to the guys that have the experience
01:32:55.20 --> 01:33:01.36 and apply that, you know. And so you really shaped and changed the platform of training for all the
01:33:01.36 --> 01:33:05.92 West Coast seal teams. And so I was super proud to be a part of that. And, um, I learned a lot
01:33:05.92 --> 01:33:11.20 about leadership and growth. You know, I learned good bosses and bad bosses. And, um, actually
01:33:11.20 --> 01:33:15.36 ended up becoming the LPO for, for, for, out. Well, I guess it's now called South, you know,
01:33:15.36 --> 01:33:19.44 Siren, all the urban warfare training for a year. And that was awesome. I got to learn
01:33:19.44 --> 01:33:24.48 actually how to work with guys and actually manage guys, you know, effectively like, and, um,
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:30.16 which, it's funny, you know, you get on the outside and you're like, man, what you're doing
01:33:30.16 --> 01:33:33.84 the outside is no big deal, you know, compared to the teams where you're like, and charge with like
01:33:33.84 --> 01:33:39.36 100 plus role players and 17 instructors and logistics for travel and hotel and make sure all the
01:33:39.36 --> 01:33:43.76 training is set up and managing the guys that Nubi talking with the other units that we're talking
01:33:43.76 --> 01:33:51.28 to and at this time, I'm still only 24, you know, maybe 25, I don't think that goes 25.
01:33:51.28 --> 01:33:57.36 Oh, no, it was 25, you know. And maybe. And, uh, so I just learned a lot about that and, um,
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.16 that was pretty cool. And then, uh, I spent a lot of time at CCC, which every good team guy loves,
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:12.48 or urban warfare, land warfare, and CCC, you know, and, um, you know, I had some really good bosses over there
01:34:12.48 --> 01:34:20.32 as well. And my boy, Chuckie, he still ends all, respect his name as well. We actually lived together
01:34:20.32 --> 01:34:28.24 and I worked for him. And that was a huge lesson of, you know, which we all have in the teams
01:34:28.24 --> 01:34:32.80 is balancing personal and professional because the teams are very tight, you know, you go out and
01:34:32.80 --> 01:34:37.68 drinking with your bosses, hang out with them and then, uh, work the next day. But different when
01:34:37.68 --> 01:34:44.96 you're living with somebody. And, um, man, I was late for work when they were on the road. And I was
01:34:44.96 --> 01:34:49.76 like, I came out and run a little late. He's like, better not be late, you know. Something's long
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:56.72 of those lines. So I get there. Like a minute late, right? Dude, I had a bomb like restriction.
01:34:58.32 --> 01:35:02.32 Not like really fallen restriction like military thanks about it, but it was like,
01:35:02.32 --> 01:35:08.48 he was like, yeah, he's got to do this. The base I was, uh, or go to you guy where I got to do all the
01:35:08.48 --> 01:35:14.24 work, you know. And, and it was good though, you know, he is, I expected that of him. Like I knew,
01:35:14.24 --> 01:35:19.52 like I made a mistake. I got to pay the man and he, you know, I put him in a heart position,
01:35:19.52 --> 01:35:25.04 you know, which was unfair to him. And, you know, you can't be doing that to your boys, you know,
01:35:25.04 --> 01:35:28.80 like you can't take advantage of like, oh, my buddies, my boss, I can do this. No, my buddies,
01:35:28.80 --> 01:35:35.36 my boss, I'm going to work even harder for him. And, you know, that's what, yeah, I was again,
01:35:35.36 --> 01:35:39.76 well upset with myself. And, yeah, there's a couple of times like he had asked me down and we just
01:35:39.76 --> 01:35:44.56 talk, he said, come in, you know, he can't be doing this stuff. He need to be focused on this. And,
01:35:44.56 --> 01:35:49.52 he really helped with my professional development, you know, really helped him, helped me learn a lot
01:35:49.52 --> 01:35:55.36 of stuff that I was able to apply to the outside and be successful. And, you know, he's still a great
01:35:55.36 --> 01:36:01.76 friend of mine. He's got a beautiful family and it's just, it's awesome seeing him grow over the years.
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:06.64 It's still kicking ass into the team. He's a legit boss. Like the guy,
01:36:06.64 --> 01:36:10.72 top of the guy is like, I really want to work for him, you know, and so I just took a lot of the
01:36:10.72 --> 01:36:15.36 stuff that I learned from him and I've applied it to the outside and it's been awesome.
01:36:15.36 --> 01:36:20.88 And you, I mean, you ended up on your outside because you made this decision to, to get out.
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:28.000 Yeah. And I'm a Quitter. Yeah, the joke is in the seal teams. If, you know, no matter what you've
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.68 done or how long you've been in for, if you ever get out of the seal teams, you're a Quitter.
01:36:32.80 --> 01:36:40.08 So, that's what they tell you. So, you decide to get out a bit, pretty much based on your
01:36:40.08 --> 01:36:47.36 family, right? Yeah, I got out. You know, I'd already had a failed marriage. You know, I have a son,
01:36:47.36 --> 01:36:54.32 a tear and California that I'll ever get to see because his mom is awesome. And, um, you know,
01:36:54.32 --> 01:37:01.60 I'm at Amanda and just, I mean, she's the love of my life. She's amazing. She deals with me and
01:37:01.60 --> 01:37:07.60 deals with me very well. I give her big props for that. Absolutely. Nice work Amanda. Yeah, she's, you know,
01:37:08.32 --> 01:37:13.28 you watched me be 300, you know, the queen. Yeah, that's her, right, 100%. You know,
01:37:13.28 --> 01:37:19.52 and, um, you know, she was going to move to San Diego with, uh, with Adon. I was super fired up
01:37:19.52 --> 01:37:25.76 about that and then, uh, she was pregnant. I'm like, okay, cool. I'm still still, still happening and then
01:37:25.76 --> 01:37:31.28 pregnant with twins. She's like, er, nope. I'm not leaving a mom and my support group.
01:37:32.40 --> 01:37:37.20 I remember I was so mad and it caused a lot of issues because I held onto that anger longer than I
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:42.88 should have. You know, and, um, I just so angry and upset, but now that I look at it, you know,
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:47.92 she's a small town Mississippi girl. Yeah. I mean, she'd gorgeous, you know, she's awesome,
01:37:48.32 --> 01:37:52.64 but she's a small town girl and, you know, sometimes we're back home, she'll be driving, just like,
01:37:52.64 --> 01:37:56.32 how you can drive, you know, because she doesn't want to drive in the traffic on, you know, the road,
01:37:56.32 --> 01:38:02.32 the main road. I think about that. I'm like, that's like no traffic here in San Diego. So it
01:38:02.32 --> 01:38:06.80 wouldn't have been fair. And then all of a sudden, it's like, for me to expect her to move to San Diego
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:12.48 with Aiden and, hey, you know, I'm taking him away from his dad, so that wasn't really fair.
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:19.36 Yeah. And I could relate to that. And, you know, her parents are awesome. So then also in
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:24.64 her friends, you know, she should get support group and it's like, you know, I was just like, man,
01:38:25.44 --> 01:38:30.16 and a couple of things didn't work out when I had screened, you know, I had another surgery
01:38:30.16 --> 01:38:34.08 when I was out. Yeah, I just took it as, hey, you know, this is maybe the time I need to move on.
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:38.16 It's a good chapter in my life. An amazing chapter that I'll never forget and it's very important
01:38:38.16 --> 01:38:45.04 who helped mold me as a man. But I absolutely was not going, I was not going to be there for
01:38:45.76 --> 01:38:51.04 Amanda and the kids, you know. And so I got out and there's a lot of guys are upset about that in the
01:38:51.04 --> 01:38:58.16 teams, you know, and don't be. Yeah, you and a couple of other guys. A couple of guys are still active,
01:38:58.16 --> 01:39:04.64 you know, but, um, it's like I got out and, um, there's a rough transition. You go from
01:39:05.36 --> 01:39:12.16 I'm born and raised in Sacramento, California and lived in San Diego, my whole life or I mean,
01:39:12.16 --> 01:39:17.44 I'm sorry, lived in San Diego the whole time in the Navy. And then I'm in North Mississippi.
01:39:19.68 --> 01:39:26.96 Yeah, awesome. Just I just, man, you talk about culture shock. It's cool to go visit, you know,
01:39:26.96 --> 01:39:31.68 I used to always love when we go out there for work, but you're leaving after two weeks. And now
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:36.48 all of a sudden I'm living there. And it was just nothing bad with the South or where I live. It just
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:44.80 for me, it was a huge change. And I go from being a seal to now I'm doing sales at a financial job,
01:39:44.80 --> 01:39:50.32 a financial company, which of course I get after it because you have to provide for your family,
01:39:50.32 --> 01:39:56.40 but just the transition and I made the mistake of not reaching out to people and asking and helping,
01:39:56.40 --> 01:40:01.04 you know, maybe like, um, one of my boys is still in, Lowe's, you know,
01:40:01.04 --> 01:40:05.44 goodbye his little nickname. I did reach out to him a couple of times and he was real solid.
01:40:05.44 --> 01:40:11.36 He would reach out to me. But I came out and how you doing? How was J.P. really doing? You know,
01:40:11.36 --> 01:40:15.12 and I talked about stuff, he was like, man, that's not good, bro. Like we need to, you know,
01:40:15.12 --> 01:40:18.40 whatever. And there's times where he's like, all right, well, you know, you just know what you need to
01:40:18.40 --> 01:40:23.20 do. And, you know, Chuck E. Same thing, Chuck E would reach out to me as well and he'd come out there
01:40:23.20 --> 01:40:27.04 for training and he'd come over and hang out with the family and the kids, you know, he's my boy, you know.
01:40:28.16 --> 01:40:34.80 And so I found a gym and a new MMA gym was opened up like right around the corner from the house.
01:40:34.80 --> 01:40:41.92 And I was like, boom, yes, you know what I mean? And came really close with a couple of guys,
01:40:42.64 --> 01:40:47.68 Jake and Zach under what they're actually from Union City, same city, Aaron Vaughn was born and raised in.
01:40:47.68 --> 01:40:54.000 So they already knew about him and I didn't tell him what I did, you know, they had no idea what I did.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.56 And so, yeah, they're like, you know, city, I was like, oh, I know Aaron Vaughn and they're like,
01:40:59.76 --> 01:41:03.12 how, how do you know, Aaron Vaughn? I'm like, are you so working together like,
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.60 what do you mean you're so worked with them? You know, and I told him like, what, oh, cool.
01:41:08.24 --> 01:41:14.32 And, you know, a couple other fighters from a gym, Joe Pass, Andy and Teddy, like just bump voice,
01:41:14.32 --> 01:41:19.84 you know, like out there, they became like, they became my team guy buddies out there, like they're cut from the same cloth as us,
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:24.64 you know, and just down to earth guys that, with Jimmy, always, they have my back out there. And they,
01:41:25.36 --> 01:41:31.84 it was weird because I never really explained much to them about my time and the teams, but they knew us having a hard time transitioning.
01:41:32.24 --> 01:41:36.000 And they were just there for me, you know, they just there at the gym, they'd push me to my limits,
01:41:36.56 --> 01:41:40.88 you know, they're like, hey, you're gonna start fighting. I'm like, awesome. You know, and so, you know,
01:41:40.88 --> 01:41:48.48 have seven amateur MMA fights and just a challenge of cutting weight and just training with the boys and sparring him.
01:41:49.12 --> 01:41:54.08 You know, I do it as a stress reliever, which is funny, you know, because like you watch some of my YouTube videos
01:41:54.40 --> 01:42:00.72 and the analysis is like, yeah, and Jeremiah Patrick says he trains as a stress reliever. That's unique.
01:42:01.12 --> 01:42:04.56 Like they don't know how to like, you know, they don't have a reaction because everyone else is like,
01:42:04.56 --> 01:42:10.40 I want to be the next USC champion and I had a horrible life and I hate my parents and I'm just, you know,
01:42:10.40 --> 01:42:16.16 I'm like, yeah, I have an awesome life. I make really good money and I just want to have a little
01:42:16.16 --> 01:42:22.16 stress reliever, you know, it's funny, you know, like, you know, I wasn't fighting to turn pro because I need to make money.
01:42:22.16 --> 01:42:27.52 I was just like, there's a lot of stress reliever. And it was being around guys that were like
01:42:27.52 --> 01:42:33.28 mind is fighting. Yes, there's fighting is fun. And sometimes when you can't get a machine gun to fight with,
01:42:33.28 --> 01:42:39.36 it's fun to fight with your fist. Yeah. And it's fun. You know, it's it's in your, it's in your
01:42:39.36 --> 01:42:45.92 parts party or instinct as a human. Yeah. No, it should be. Well, yeah, it's not. Yeah. I guess,
01:42:45.92 --> 01:42:50.48 I guess for some people it's not, but for the people that I know it's part of their instinct as a human
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:54.40 is you should be able to defend yourself. You want to be able to fight, you know, you should.
01:42:54.40 --> 01:42:59.20 I mean, you watch little kids, little six year old seven year old kids after you bring any random
01:42:59.20 --> 01:43:05.36 six year old or seven year old boy into a jujitsu place and put them on a room with padded walls and
01:43:05.36 --> 01:43:09.04 padded floor and you say do whatever you want they're going to end up attacking each other. That's the
01:43:09.04 --> 01:43:14.80 way it works. That was my daughter's like, I got on my jujitsu two weeks before they turned three.
01:43:14.80 --> 01:43:20.88 Nice. As most of the owners of German, Joel, he's a former team one guy. He's a part owner of the
01:43:20.88 --> 01:43:26.40 gym. He's a five time world champion. And I believe it's ghee four time world champion, no ghee.
01:43:26.40 --> 01:43:31.36 I don't think he's had one point scored on him in the last five years. Yes, I saw it. Just bringing
01:43:31.36 --> 01:43:38.32 the team guy reputation into jujitsu world. You know, that's it. Just tell us it. Joel,
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:44.80 Gingery. I don't know. Team one. He's so solid. How old is he's 50 something? How
01:43:44.80 --> 01:43:50.24 how do I know him? He must have been the teams are the same. I mean, I was at team one for like eight
01:43:50.24 --> 01:43:55.68 years. Maybe it's when you went to the East Coast. I don't know. Anyway, super solid guy. I remember
01:43:55.68 --> 01:44:01.20 you when you started when you started fighting. Yeah. And you were like, I'm going to fight. You
01:44:01.20 --> 01:44:06.32 know, because you said me text too. Yeah. You said me a text like, I'm going to, I'm starting to train.
01:44:06.32 --> 01:44:10.72 And then like a month later you're like, dude, I'm I'm getting into it. And then a month later you're like,
01:44:10.72 --> 01:44:14.64 bro, I can't believe I did train with you all the time. Because you guys are trained in this
01:44:14.64 --> 01:44:19.76 list. But like, I'll train with anybody any time. And you would train with me like once a month
01:44:19.76 --> 01:44:25.28 when you could have been training with me seven days a week. I was furious. I was, I was, I was laughing
01:44:25.28 --> 01:44:30.000 inside and I was also pissed and I was like, I tell people that. Oh my god. So I basically
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.44 could have been doing a Jitu since 2005. Yeah. Jocco. Yeah. And people like, what? I'm like, I could have,
01:44:37.44 --> 01:44:43.28 but you know, I just, I guess I never really got the like the taste like I like to stand. I don't know.
01:44:43.28 --> 01:44:47.68 I'm an idiot. That's why I did an episode. You know, actually, and then get yourself, you called yourself
01:44:47.68 --> 01:44:52.56 an idiot when you were talking about your youth before. And I realized that when I bring
01:44:53.12 --> 01:44:58.32 team guys on here, when they talk about like their past, the term idiot comes up all the time. I know
01:44:58.32 --> 01:45:04.000 I do it all by my calls and idiot. Yeah. And Tony's like, I was an idiot. It's just like classic,
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.40 you know. You know, I mean, like, and then when I tell people like, yeah, you know, since 2005,
01:45:08.40 --> 01:45:12.40 Jocco could have been rolling in training all the time. And then when you opened your gym,
01:45:12.40 --> 01:45:17.76 you know, guys like echo and his brother and do you list her and you know, I was there. But I was
01:45:17.76 --> 01:45:23.76 always doing the stand up stuff. And I was doing Jitu just to do Jitu. I didn't do anything
01:45:23.76 --> 01:45:29.28 in the M. A. Stuff, you know. Now look back at it. Just like, Jitu made me get upset about it. Sometimes,
01:45:29.28 --> 01:45:34.80 I'll tell people like, yeah, and they're like, you're an idiot. You know, like, like, Jocco,
01:45:34.80 --> 01:45:40.96 Dean Lister, and you know, like, just whatever. I mean, hey, everything happens for a reason. I mean,
01:45:40.96 --> 01:45:45.76 I've done pretty well so far. I'm six and one. And, you know, the guys out there are solid.
01:45:45.76 --> 01:45:48.96 Yeah, solid. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I was a week straight last night.
01:45:48.96 --> 01:45:54.80 Yeah, I had done anything like 60 months. Yeah. Yeah. That, that injury went into my last fight.
01:45:55.36 --> 01:46:00.40 You know, my coaches were like, down pulling you. And Joel, dude, he's such a legit badass. Just
01:46:00.40 --> 01:46:05.04 tough. Like, people are terrified of him. But he has the other side that people don't realize
01:46:05.04 --> 01:46:09.68 team guys have where he's like, hey, I'm pulling you from this fight. Like, I can't let you get hurt.
01:46:09.68 --> 01:46:13.92 You know, like the nurturing, like, you got to take care of your boys. Because I went into it with
01:46:13.92 --> 01:46:20.56 a facial fracture from here, done to hear all these teeth are still numb from it. I deviated
01:46:20.56 --> 01:46:26.08 septum crush sinuses and a herniated disc in my neck. What'd you do getting to fight with a bear?
01:46:26.80 --> 01:46:31.92 Yeah, sparring Teddy Holder. Oh, you know, knocked out Chago Silva. Yeah, that's one of my boys in
01:46:31.92 --> 01:46:37.68 Andy, Yuruk, Bellator fighter. I mean, Zach, all these guys. I mean, just they get after it, you know.
01:46:37.92 --> 01:46:43.60 And, um, yeah, I hope they get after a little bit less of your sparring sessions for now on. Yeah, we learned
01:46:43.60 --> 01:46:48.72 that well, and also it was pretty, that's an old school man. I'm telling you now, that is old school.
01:46:48.72 --> 01:46:52.88 You don't need to spar like that. No, we know that. And, you know, in the guys have changed up.
01:46:52.88 --> 01:46:56.88 Yeah, so legitimately changed up because guys were getting knocked out and fights. And, you know,
01:46:56.88 --> 01:47:00.24 we could talk that could be a whole none the podcast, but they get really changed it up.
01:47:01.36 --> 01:47:07.12 And so, but I, you know, when I got the call for that fight, I thought not to
01:47:07.12 --> 01:47:15.52 close before that with this guy, a tough, tough guy. You know, ours was like a grudge match.
01:47:15.52 --> 01:47:19.68 You know, everyone thought we hated each other. And, you know, we just, do we sold so many tickets
01:47:19.68 --> 01:47:23.44 or is insane? Like we each sold over 110 tickets. So you're like, you're like the
01:47:23.44 --> 01:47:27.20 Conner McGregor of Amateur of fighting. The Conner McGregor, Amateur of fighting in the mid-South.
01:47:27.20 --> 01:47:31.84 Yeah, mid-South things. It's like the next big thing. And that's like, you know, and so
01:47:31.84 --> 01:47:38.16 it's something you guys mean that guy Danny Shell, good guy. You know, he's awesome. Dude,
01:47:38.16 --> 01:47:42.56 he really is a really good guy. You know, I mean, we just, we'd get after it on social media just
01:47:42.56 --> 01:47:48.32 to, you know, just because we're born, I guess. But it came down, you know, we had a tough fight,
01:47:48.32 --> 01:47:52.56 you know what I mean? And, you know, I mean, it was, it was awesome. Like you watch it. We're just
01:47:52.56 --> 01:47:59.84 waiting for it. I thought anywhere between 172.205. My first fight, we're going to
01:47:59.84 --> 01:48:06.96 run that right now. Uh, 2015. Yeah. Um, not nice. You, you're not a good two-fifth. I tried to be gentle over
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:12.32 here. No, that's fine. You don't have to. You know, but my first pass. Yeah, exactly. Hey,
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:16.88 you used to walk around like in the in the in the in the in the bruiser, you were like 185. No,
01:48:16.88 --> 01:48:22.64 like that was my heaviest. Like I couldn't break 185. Like I was trying to like do like all the body
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:26.80 building lives. Yeah. Like get his biggest I could. I could never break 185. And then my dad's
01:48:26.80 --> 01:48:32.32 like dude wait until you get your 30s. Like whatever. He's like, oh, okay. Because your body is
01:48:32.32 --> 01:48:35.92 a little legitimately done. Everything mine has that every aging command. And then yeah,
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:42.64 get big. But my first fight fought at 205. But I only weighed 190. Um, because I was going to fight
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:50.08 at 185 for my first fight. But, um, that's why I know him. I don't go by Jeremiah now on like social media
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:55.12 because guys started googling Jeremiah to know, you know, I test fight against Justin and Jerry
01:48:55.12 --> 01:48:58.16 with the whole Chris Kyle thing and whatnot. So you google Jeremiah to know, there's a bunch of
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:03.36 Navy seals up out there. And so I checked that's why I checked my Facebook page to Jeremiah Patrick
01:49:03.36 --> 01:49:07.84 just because you know, fighters would look that up. I'd like to my coaches were like, they didn't
01:49:07.84 --> 01:49:13.12 want to tell me. I knew there's something weird with Jake and Zach and my dad. Like I knew there
01:49:13.12 --> 01:49:18.64 was something going on. My fighter backed out. Oh, and then they're trying to find like another fighter.
01:49:18.64 --> 01:49:24.16 And then he backed out. I think it was like two or three guys. I had sold on my first fight
01:49:24.16 --> 01:49:30.08 over a hundred tickets also. Like I'd fed I'd people flying in from California driving out like
01:49:30.08 --> 01:49:34.80 like drive for East Coast West Coast, Washington, you know, my ant and alcohol flying out. It's like
01:49:34.80 --> 01:49:39.28 first amateur fight. This is ridiculous, right? Should have just traveled somewhere where this better
01:49:39.28 --> 01:49:47.20 be a good show. Exactly. Well, for Washington. So yeah, exactly. You know, and um, I remember
01:49:47.20 --> 01:49:51.92 telling my buddy Jake, I'm like, dude, I don't care if it's a heavyweight. Get me a fight. Like I
01:49:51.92 --> 01:49:57.04 can't not fight, you know, I mean, like I will find. So I found some good he had a good amount of
01:49:57.04 --> 01:50:04.40 fights already and like he cut down to two or five and I weighed in with your flip flops. Like cut off
01:50:04.40 --> 01:50:09.76 can't be sure. It's all my stuff. My pocket is at 1901. And um, that was awesome. It's good. Good
01:50:09.76 --> 01:50:15.60 to go first fight. Um, got myself way too amped up for it. You know, I should have just gone in.
01:50:15.60 --> 01:50:20.72 That one's on video, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I sent you everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was
01:50:20.72 --> 01:50:28.56 looking at that fight and I'm like, yes, this is the JP that's extremely amped right. Yeah.
01:50:28.56 --> 01:50:34.24 Yeah. Yeah. The finish him in the second fight. Uh, second round. Um, TKO and the second fight.
01:50:34.24 --> 01:50:41.52 Finch that guy on the first round. Uh, third fight. Which was hilarious. I had me as the main event
01:50:41.52 --> 01:50:46.24 on this card for the third fight. That's it. You're getting yourself in a hundred tickets. I know.
01:50:46.24 --> 01:50:51.20 You know, yeah. We're pretty in the main event. Yeah. That's, yeah. Not good for adding just
01:50:51.20 --> 01:50:55.76 unneeded stress. Well, you know what? You know what? No kidding. Like in watching your
01:50:55.76 --> 01:51:00.80 fights and everything. You do have the, I mean, you have this anyways, but you, you have like a level
01:51:00.80 --> 01:51:07.36 of charisma that makes people want to watch you fight because you're just fired up and you have a
01:51:07.36 --> 01:51:11.92 good level charisma. It's like, you know, you're like, I compared you to Connor McGregor jokingly.
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:16.96 Yeah. But it's a reality. If you watch some of your fights, it's like, yeah, Gekke's in the mid-South
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:22.16 people going, I want to go watch Jeremiah Dell get after it. Punch him in the fight. Yeah. Like
01:51:22.16 --> 01:51:27.04 this. He should come watch him fights in the South. It's always the tickets, man. I think I can
01:51:27.04 --> 01:51:32.64 get you a ticket, bro. But, you know, the so the fights have been awesome. Uh, my fourth fight, I lost.
01:51:33.92 --> 01:51:38.80 I actually went into that fight ahead. I was in the hospital or the doctors in and out of the doctors,
01:51:38.80 --> 01:51:45.36 almost hospital, like the week prior. Uh, I was cutting out a 170 again also with hand foot mouth
01:51:45.36 --> 01:51:50.08 disease. Is that, is that your method of cutting weight? Get your self-hand foot mouth disease.
01:51:50.08 --> 01:51:55.84 Dude, I would not recommend it at all. Uh, I had to take this medicine to numb my mouth and
01:51:55.84 --> 01:52:00.80 throughout just to drink water. So it did help with cutting weight, except for it was horrible.
01:52:00.80 --> 01:52:07.12 Amanda was legitimately taking care of me like everything. And she's helped. So she preps all my meals,
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:11.20 you know, come home for the jam and she, you know, we get out. I mean, are you, you think you're
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:17.92 gonna fight again? Yes. You know, you got to heal up. But yeah, it's been good. Yeah, I've
01:52:17.92 --> 01:52:22.48 looked, I mean, you and you also had a rough, rough, little rough patch with Amanda, right?
01:52:23.28 --> 01:52:30.40 Yeah, yeah, we did. Um, you know, I owe emotional thinking about that sometimes just,
01:52:32.32 --> 01:52:36.08 you know, we're so lucky. What we have. We got a second chance, you know, we actually
01:52:36.08 --> 01:52:42.72 fallen how to divorce, moved out. I had my own house, you know, she was doing her own thing. I was doing
01:52:42.72 --> 01:52:49.20 my own thing. And, um, you know, I just came down a lot of communication, which when I really look
01:52:49.20 --> 01:52:56.16 at it and we both look at it and we were both just being selfish, which, like, I, I tried to think
01:52:56.16 --> 01:53:01.76 that's not me. And with Amanda, like, that's not her. You talk about somebody who's not selfish,
01:53:01.76 --> 01:53:09.44 I hate that's her, like, to an extent, but we just, I don't know. Yeah, well, it's bizarre too. And
01:53:09.44 --> 01:53:18.24 because you, you are, I mean, in the teams, you are obviously extremely selfless. And, but I see
01:53:18.24 --> 01:53:25.60 how these things happen. For whatever reason, with your team guy, bros, it's like, I'll do anything
01:53:25.60 --> 01:53:29.84 for you. And I've had situations with you where I've been like, hey, I need this right now and
01:53:29.84 --> 01:53:34.40 you've been like, I'll be there in three minutes and 30 seconds. And I'm like, okay, cool. You know,
01:53:34.40 --> 01:53:41.76 and, and, but for some reason, guys don't always, guys and girls both don't always do the best
01:53:41.76 --> 01:53:48.80 job of translating that selflessness into that relationship at home. So it happens, but I'm glad that
01:53:48.80 --> 01:53:54.24 you guys were able to kind of, yeah, I'm able to do that. Yeah, like I said, you know, about a year,
01:53:54.24 --> 01:54:00.08 you know, we're doing our own thing. And, you know, we just kept getting drawn back to each other and
01:54:00.08 --> 01:54:06.80 it was a kids. And everyone says, oh, my kids are so smart. Our daughters and Aiden are
01:54:06.80 --> 01:54:12.08 incredibly intelligent. Like, you know, my daughters will be five in January. So this time,
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:16.24 for them, you know, they're, they're, they're three, you know, and they know what's going on.
01:54:16.24 --> 01:54:20.48 You know, and they're trying to be like, hey, you know, you know, my daughter knows, like,
01:54:20.48 --> 01:54:24.80 well, you know, daddy, if you and mommy didn't argue so much, maybe we could all live together.
01:54:26.80 --> 01:54:33.44 And to hear that from your kids, you know, I was just like, it was rough. It was really hard.
01:54:34.08 --> 01:54:39.92 And you do anything for your kids, you know? So what do you think is the key element that made you go?
01:54:39.92 --> 01:54:45.28 You know what, Jack asks idiot, you need to get in the game here and make this work. Like, what?
01:54:45.28 --> 01:54:50.72 And then what method did you use? Where you said, okay, next time that she does this,
01:54:50.72 --> 01:54:54.64 I'm going to counter instead of attacking or instead of getting defensive, I'm just going to be like,
01:54:54.64 --> 01:55:00.40 all right. So what made me get back in the game is I still loved her. Like, I was just,
01:55:00.40 --> 01:55:05.12 I'm still, you know, head over heels and love with her. And head over and heel and love with
01:55:05.12 --> 01:55:09.92 my kids. And I didn't want somebody else raised my kids and Aiden, you know, like, I would still
01:55:09.92 --> 01:55:15.12 pick him up and take him to school. You know, even though, you know, okay. So there's a pretty
01:55:15.12 --> 01:55:21.20 clear answer, then what did you have to change to make it work when you went back when you said,
01:55:21.20 --> 01:55:27.44 hey, I'm going to, the zoo, in your own mind, what did you do differently? That's made it successful.
01:55:27.44 --> 01:55:33.20 We put each other first, boom. And we learned to communicate, you know, and I was sitting in
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:38.88 Amanda, you know, I don't know. We both just had like this come to Jesus with somebody, like,
01:55:38.88 --> 01:55:44.80 I can't remember who I was talking to. I don't know who she was talking to. And, you know,
01:55:44.80 --> 01:55:48.48 she's crafty. She's smart. She knows how to deal with me. You're right. So she calls.
01:55:49.28 --> 01:55:54.40 And she knows it's my weekend. It's all obviously she's calling me to talk to the kids. And she's like,
01:55:54.40 --> 01:55:57.92 hey, can I talk to the girls? My, yeah, absolutely. I'm sorry, put on a speaker phone. She's like,
01:55:57.92 --> 01:56:02.48 hey, girls, a lot of you. Hey, girls, do you want daddy to pick me up for a church? So we can all go
01:56:02.48 --> 01:56:09.52 together. Do that was so pissed. And the chorus, the girls, like, yeah, she was like, I was like,
01:56:09.52 --> 01:56:14.88 cool, hey, outside and five minutes, or I'm driving. Still going to keep driving. You know,
01:56:14.88 --> 01:56:20.40 she's waiting outside in this dress. Looks stunning. Just, I was like, all right. And that was at the
01:56:20.40 --> 01:56:24.80 beginning, you know, and then we just learned to communicate with each other and we, we put each other
01:56:24.80 --> 01:56:29.68 first and you know, cover and move exactly. Maybe a lot of cover moves. There's a lot of cover
01:56:29.68 --> 01:56:35.44 move. And we legitimately have to put each other first. Instead of, you know, just doing it as a team,
01:56:35.44 --> 01:56:39.12 like my focus. And I'm, I don't do this all the time on it. Try to act like we have this
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:44.32 perfect relationship and everything's phenomenal now. But we legitimately try to put each other first
01:56:44.32 --> 01:56:49.52 and almost everything that we do to try to take care of each other. And out of all the arguments that
01:56:49.52 --> 01:56:54.80 we've ever had or anybody else has ever had with their significant other, it was because it was too
01:56:54.80 --> 01:57:00.000 complicated. Something was complicated and messed up. And so we just had to simplify things.
01:57:01.36 --> 01:57:07.04 Let's just go ahead to, you know, law combat number two, exactly. We got one covered. Yeah,
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:10.72 cover move. Keep things simple. Cover move. Keep things simple. Yeah. And I know what you're
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:14.80 talking about. You know what that is. That's when you, when you take a look at this argument that you're
01:57:14.80 --> 01:57:19.84 in and you go wait a second. What are we arguing about right now? Oh, we're arguing because I put my
01:57:19.84 --> 01:57:26.48 spaghetti in the microwave before you did. You know what? I'm sorry. Yeah, I'll let you have this
01:57:26.48 --> 01:57:31.12 spaghetti first. Let's simplify because because that little thing of who's using the microwave
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:35.84 first, all the sudden spirals into you, you know, a major blowout if you're not careful. It's
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:41.28 over something stupid. I mean, she's an alpha female. I'm an alpha male. So of course,
01:57:41.28 --> 01:57:45.04 we're just like at times we just want to challenge you Tyler, but then we're like,
01:57:46.32 --> 01:57:51.20 no, this is stupid. Yeah. I had an idea instead of challenging each other. Why don't we work together
01:57:51.20 --> 01:57:55.28 and start with the world? I know. That's all. Well, that's our plan right now. We're doing it.
01:57:56.56 --> 01:58:02.72 And then, you know, I mean, and then just legitimately figuring out what it was priorities in our life.
01:58:02.72 --> 01:58:07.76 Like we just had to be so we could be on the same page. Echo, priority or time is execute.
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:14.56 Boo. Boo. Boo. Yeah. Look at that. And I was, I've talked a couple of different people about this.
01:58:14.56 --> 01:58:18.56 You know, you know, it's awesome that you're saying this because I've heard a bunch of times from
01:58:18.56 --> 01:58:23.12 people that'm like, oh, extreme ownership saved our marriage. But I've never, I've always said,
01:58:23.12 --> 01:58:27.44 cool, thanks. But I've never said like, explain that to me. Yeah. But now you're explaining to me. Yeah.
01:58:27.44 --> 01:58:32.24 And it, it absolutely does. I mean, I always thought they focused on the ownership part,
01:58:32.24 --> 01:58:37.20 meaning, oh, don't worry. Hey, I'm going to take ownership of this. I'm going to, I made a mistake.
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:41.84 Here's where I'm going to do to fix it. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Yeah. I always thought that that's just what
01:58:41.84 --> 01:58:46.000 they were talking about. But you're going ahead and applying other laws of combat to your marriage and
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.32 making things happen. Yeah. Pretty legit. Yeah. I mean, and, you know, Amanda's the one that, you know,
01:58:51.28 --> 01:58:55.44 just recognize a lot of these, these shortfalls that we're having and would just
01:58:56.40 --> 01:59:00.96 communicate with me and she'd like, hey, if you're upset with me over something, I probably didn't
01:59:00.96 --> 01:59:07.84 mean to do that on purpose. So just let me know. That's good. And so that's simple. Yeah. And so,
01:59:07.84 --> 01:59:14.000 as far as us prioritizing things like we just, you know, and we still, we need to get like an actual
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.64 fall on detailed detailed game plan for what we're doing. But we realized what was important and
01:59:18.64 --> 01:59:23.68 what wasn't important. And some of these certain things like the things that truly weren't
01:59:23.68 --> 01:59:29.28 important, like I don't think twice about it and she doesn't either. And we just focused on
01:59:29.28 --> 01:59:35.44 our goals for her business, my business, raising our kids the right way, trying to be involved in
01:59:35.44 --> 01:59:40.24 the church as much as possible, trying to give back to others like those are our priorities,
01:59:40.24 --> 01:59:45.04 not the stupid like, well, you said you're coming home at 10, but you stayed out drinking while
01:59:45.04 --> 01:59:51.20 with your girlfriend until 11. Who cares? She came home to me. She was relaxing with her girlfriend
01:59:51.20 --> 01:59:55.60 while since I've been gone for three weeks for work. Like, she should have stayed out all night
01:59:55.60 --> 01:59:59.12 and just relax. You know what I mean? Like, hey, how does sleep over at your friend's house?
01:59:59.12 --> 02:00:02.72 So you don't have to wake up to the kids three times during the night. That's what I should have done,
02:00:02.72 --> 02:00:07.44 you know? And she's done the same with me, you know? Like, I was a couple of times where I'm just like
02:00:07.44 --> 02:00:11.60 super stressed out or whatever and she's like, okay, you know, what do we need to do? Like, what do you
02:00:11.60 --> 02:00:16.24 need, she's like, you know what? You need to go workout. I'm like, yeah, but we need to go do this right now.
02:00:16.24 --> 02:00:22.16 And she's like, no, what we need to do is you need to go workout and I can handle this. That's awesome.
02:00:22.16 --> 02:00:25.84 And it's just been awesome. You know, night and day like, I think about it like, dude,
02:00:26.72 --> 02:00:32.24 she's such a hard worker, you know, and she runs everything and then she'll make sure I have a
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:38.000 cup of coffee like on the nightstand like next me in the morning. So I went up, you know, and it's just like,
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:42.08 you woke up early to go do that. So now like, I'll try to like do stuff for her or whatever.
02:00:42.08 --> 02:00:48.48 Dude, it's just one awesome one upsmanship. Yeah of kind acts. Right. I don't know. I hope my wife
02:00:48.48 --> 02:00:53.84 doesn't start that game with me. I'll lose. It's it's hard though with her because she is,
02:00:53.84 --> 02:00:58.56 she's so thoughtful and crafty like all of a sudden like, you know, I don't know, she's,
02:00:58.56 --> 02:01:01.84 it's awesome. So life's been good. You know, it's really turned around. I mean, there's a real
02:01:01.84 --> 02:01:08.96 dark time. I'm not gonna lie. Like, there was the divorce was rough, you know, and there's some other
02:01:08.96 --> 02:01:15.92 times before that that was real rough. You know, I was, I was drink a lot, taking painkillers,
02:01:15.92 --> 02:01:19.68 just because I had injuries. Yeah. But I was like, oh, I have an injury so I can take this
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:24.32 painkiller. Oh, I can take two to three and drink at the same time. I was just trying to
02:01:24.32 --> 02:01:28.56 numb a lot of stuff that was going on, which is not the path to ghost, not the path to all.
02:01:28.56 --> 02:01:34.56 I wouldn't, we know that. And, you know, one of the things, I mean, there's so many things I'm
02:01:34.56 --> 02:01:38.72 pretty sure that I made to help me through, but I remember when I went to the VA because I was having
02:01:38.72 --> 02:01:44.64 a little hard time sleeping and just my body was all on a whack. Turns out I had like, my body wasn't
02:01:44.64 --> 02:01:49.20 producing testosterone anymore. I didn't know that, right? Oh, so I didn't know that, but
02:01:49.20 --> 02:01:54.88 so I go to the VA. I come home with like a bag of like no kidding, like eight different meds
02:01:54.88 --> 02:02:00.96 that they want to me to start taking. I was like, okay. So I take it first time. Like, oh my,
02:02:00.96 --> 02:02:06.64 like, she had like, get me out of bed for me to go to work because I was like a zombie. And it started
02:02:06.64 --> 02:02:11.52 then, like the second day and then that stuff started becoming really addicting. Like, I wanted
02:02:11.52 --> 02:02:18.40 that like numb feeling and she was just like, you're not the same person, like quick, like she
02:02:18.40 --> 02:02:25.12 recognized it. And we got off, like I was able, and I wasn't even on that stuff for like a full week.
02:02:25.12 --> 02:02:30.08 And it was so hard for me not to take it. Like, she had to straight up like how I mean,
02:02:30.08 --> 02:02:34.56 D-talk, like, I'm not saying D-talk's in a bad way, like somebody who's like, but it was bad,
02:02:34.56 --> 02:02:39.44 you know, and she identified that right away. That's the thing. And it was just like, oh, I know.
02:02:39.44 --> 02:02:43.68 And it was just like, nope, like we're flushing this. Like, this is gone. Like, we'll figure something
02:02:43.68 --> 02:02:48.08 else that. And she's always been the one to, you know, figure something else that and make make sure
02:02:48.08 --> 02:02:52.96 we work as a team on it. So it's been awesome, man. She's amazing. That is awesome. Where does this,
02:02:52.96 --> 02:02:56.64 where does all this leave you right now? What do you got going on right now? So, um,
02:02:56.64 --> 02:03:00.64 sorry, my own company called Never Settle Consulting. You know, I did sales in financial
02:03:00.64 --> 02:03:06.16 company for a while. Uh, a lot of good relationships. My sales team was awesome. Uh,
02:03:06.16 --> 02:03:11.12 but I want to do my own thing. Um, I wanted a little more fulfillment. It was taking a time away
02:03:11.12 --> 02:03:16.72 from me being able to do what I wanted to do to be able to grow and, you know, spend more time with my family.
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.48 Um, because I had a second chance, you know, a second chance with Amanda and with my kids and I,
02:03:22.48 --> 02:03:28.32 I wanted to do something that fulfilled me that would help us grow. You know, so I started
02:03:28.32 --> 02:03:33.84 never settle consulting teaching tactics, combatants, and shooting to law enforcement,
02:03:33.84 --> 02:03:38.80 uh, trying to work out some stuff with some smaller military units and groups and, uh,
02:03:38.80 --> 02:03:45.36 for private civilian groups as well and, uh, able to incorporate leadership and sales team building events
02:03:45.36 --> 02:03:50.08 into that, you know, just doing what I love. Like, what I'm, um, decently good at, you know, as
02:03:50.08 --> 02:03:54.80 well. And so, how do a couple of buddies who's that, hey, I need a second instructor for this,
02:03:55.44 --> 02:03:59.92 you know, so I helped teach a long-range shooting course for NRR outdoors and then taught a
02:03:59.92 --> 02:04:06.32 carbine course for them as well. Um, so it's, it's been good, you know, it ties up and down. You know,
02:04:06.32 --> 02:04:11.04 I've worked with a couple clients that I thought was going to be a long-term thing and it didn't, but,
02:04:11.04 --> 02:04:15.28 hey, it's business, you're out on your own, you learn your lessons, you just keep moving forward them.
02:04:16.08 --> 02:04:19.68 You know, a lot of people like, why, why never settle? Like, they're like, I get it. It's awesome.
02:04:19.68 --> 02:04:23.84 And I was like, well, I just miss being in the sealed teams. You know, I miss being around guys that
02:04:23.84 --> 02:04:31.44 for the most part, legitimately, did not settle with average or, you know, a mediocre lifestyle.
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:35.68 Like, you just didn't happen. You know, you're always constantly driving and pushing you
02:04:35.68 --> 02:04:40.96 each other to be better, to be stronger, to be faster, to be smarter, you know, I remember multiple
02:04:40.96 --> 02:04:45.20 times like you would come in to, hey, if you ever heard this website, I'm like, no, you're like,
02:04:45.20 --> 02:04:50.32 you need to start reading it every morning. I'm like, okay, so I go in and I'd print off the articles
02:04:50.32 --> 02:04:54.000 and I read them and highlight them and chocolate later on. He's like, hey, you hear about this? Like,
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.52 yeah, actually, boom. Yeah, and so, you know, I just miss being around that, you know, and that's not
02:04:59.52 --> 02:05:05.20 in the, for the most part, you don't find that in civilian life outside, you know, in business. You don't.
02:05:05.84 --> 02:05:10.56 And I really wanted to be able to have an impact, like I want to work with veterans that have
02:05:10.56 --> 02:05:16.64 issues that are going through problems. I want to give back to law enforcement, you know, because
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:23.68 they have a hard job, man, and they're underfunded, they're under trained. And I just, I wanted
02:05:23.68 --> 02:05:29.12 to give back, you know, and I enjoy that. I like doing that stuff. And it gives me freedom to be able
02:05:29.12 --> 02:05:32.96 to choose, you know, to help out with different projects and help people, and, you know, a man has
02:05:32.96 --> 02:05:38.40 been super supportive, and, you know, the other logo of Navarretutals, win the fight.
02:05:39.12 --> 02:05:44.24 No matter what, you just win the fight, and it's not a physical thing. It's life is a fight.
02:05:44.24 --> 02:05:49.68 We all go through our fights. We just have to establish what we want, like you talk about,
02:05:49.68 --> 02:05:53.92 the commanders intent. Like, if you don't have your own commanders intent for you and your family,
02:05:53.92 --> 02:05:58.000 you're screwed. You're going to wander around, and you're just going to waste your life away.
02:05:58.56 --> 02:06:04.24 And so I just, you know, and then under it is, in Latin, you know, signed met to,
02:06:04.24 --> 02:06:09.68 which means without fear. You know, fear is the opposite of faith. Like you read about Mikey, you know,
02:06:09.68 --> 02:06:18.64 you know, fear is no match for my faith. And I believe that. And I want others to believe that.
02:06:18.64 --> 02:06:23.04 I don't think a lot of people out there believe that. And if we can paint that message, and
02:06:23.60 --> 02:06:27.12 I would love, you know, for my company to be more of like a lifestyle, you know,
02:06:27.68 --> 02:06:32.64 and did some do went and got my logo tattooed on his calf. Because he's like, I wanted to be a
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:36.48 reminder, and he would incorporate his kids names into the tattoo. He's like, dude, it's a daily
02:06:36.48 --> 02:06:40.80 reminder for me, not just settle for average and just get after it. And I'm like, all right,
02:06:40.80 --> 02:06:45.12 I'm doing something right. Hopefully, you know, and so Amanda's super supportive of it, you know,
02:06:45.12 --> 02:06:49.36 and she's just doing everything to help me out with it. And you know, she has her business, and she's
02:06:49.36 --> 02:06:55.12 still takes a time to help me grow mine. So it's awesome. And just helping people figure out what they
02:06:55.12 --> 02:06:59.04 want in life. Like, because I don't think a lot of people will take the time to establish that.
02:06:59.60 --> 02:07:04.96 And, you know, I think if we can help that, and if we can help veterans,
02:07:04.96 --> 02:07:11.04 and if we can help the youth, figure out what they want out of life and where they need to go,
02:07:11.44 --> 02:07:15.84 but I think, you know, we can actually make an impact in this nation. And that's important right now.
02:07:17.04 --> 02:07:22.72 Yeah, there's no doubt about that. And I guess that kind of brings us up to speed for this
02:07:23.76 --> 02:07:31.12 or up to present day with with where JPEs at right now been a pretty good chunk of time.
02:07:31.12 --> 02:07:37.28 And it's probably about good for tonight. And obviously,
02:07:38.72 --> 02:07:44.88 thanks for coming on the podcast. I mean, one of the, one of the best things for me about this podcast
02:07:45.60 --> 02:07:50.08 is that there's heroes like you that people don't know about. And those heroes from the past
02:07:50.08 --> 02:07:56.48 that people don't know about and being able to bring heroes like yourself and heroes from the past
02:07:56.48 --> 02:08:03.60 till the present time and let people know and introduce that there's warriors in the past.
02:08:03.60 --> 02:08:07.52 You need to know about and there's warriors walking with us today that you need to know about.
02:08:08.40 --> 02:08:12.56 And that's one of my favorite things about the podcast is having the opportunity to do that.
02:08:13.68 --> 02:08:18.32 And if, if you like listening to this podcast, we'll guess what?
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:24.08 I believe echo Charles can tell you how to support the podcast. I have a question.
02:08:24.08 --> 02:08:27.84 Oh, man. Here we go. Hot sea. Why are you going to find you like that?
02:08:27.84 --> 02:08:37.04 I remember, um, I actually, the day I met you long time ago before I actually knew you real good.
02:08:38.64 --> 02:08:40.32 You don't be real good now. Was that new?
02:08:40.32 --> 02:08:41.84 Yeah. Oh, so big.
02:08:43.28 --> 02:08:47.76 But like you, you always, and actually listening to you now, like you kind of, I kind of realized,
02:08:47.76 --> 02:08:51.68 like you live in the moment a lot. Yeah. Yes. Like I remember we were sitting at this
02:08:51.68 --> 02:08:55.04 when we had sushi that night. Yeah. First time at May, you're like, what was that? Like, oh,
02:08:55.04 --> 02:08:57.76 it's just seven or something. 2007. Yeah. Yeah.
02:08:59.12 --> 02:09:03.28 And I remember you and you had another guy with you. I'm about to get it. Yeah, my buddy, um,
02:09:04.24 --> 02:09:08.64 cart. Yeah. And I remember, um, we're all talking about what I, you know, everyone's talking.
02:09:08.64 --> 02:09:12.88 And I hear you kind of on the side you're like, like, this is good, man. You know,
02:09:12.88 --> 02:09:17.20 in sushi with good people, you know, we're doing, you know, kind of like you're totally,
02:09:17.20 --> 02:09:20.64 it's like you're explaining to him, but you're explaining to yourself, like, what, what
02:09:20.64 --> 02:09:25.12 am I experiencing right now? And how good is this? How cool is this? Yeah. Almost like you
02:09:25.12 --> 02:09:28.72 had this stuff coming up and you're, but you're living in that moment. Yeah. There's just like,
02:09:28.72 --> 02:09:33.60 just like with the stories. Oh, like, you mentioned like the, and you saw the ambient light coming
02:09:33.60 --> 02:09:38.16 down. This is awesome. This is awesome. Yeah. What, like, why is that do you think? Or, I mean,
02:09:38.16 --> 02:09:43.44 is there a specific reason to you? Because a lot of people not like that. You know, like,
02:09:43.44 --> 02:09:47.20 there'll be like, oh, we're about to do this. I'm excited or that thing happened and that's,
02:09:47.20 --> 02:09:51.28 that's whack or whatever. Yeah. And they don't really, you know what I mean? I've always been like that,
02:09:52.32 --> 02:09:59.12 you know, my parents taught us to enjoy what you have. You know, it doesn't have to be material stuff,
02:09:59.12 --> 02:10:04.40 just enjoy the life that you have. And I've also always realized that people haven't a lot worse.
02:10:04.40 --> 02:10:08.24 And then after two deployments, you know, because I met you after my second deployment,
02:10:08.88 --> 02:10:15.12 like I'd seen the worst. Like, I'd seen evil firsthand. I'd seen actual oppression, not what some
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:21.76 of these idiots are talking about right now. You know, I'd seen, you know, kids with underwear on
02:10:21.76 --> 02:10:28.48 and sandals in the streets. And that's all they had. I've seen, you know, women holding their kids
02:10:28.48 --> 02:10:35.76 crying. You know, I've seen guys use kids as human shields because they're cowards. And
02:10:36.64 --> 02:10:42.56 I'm getting to sit and enjoy sushi in San Diego, California with my best friend, Curtis, from
02:10:42.56 --> 02:10:48.000 high school and a new group of guys that I met, you know, through other team guys. And I'm like,
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.80 man, life is good. We were with the kicknuts by the way. Oh, okay. That's making a
02:10:52.80 --> 02:10:58.80 little difference. Yeah. I'm about cast. Yeah. Solid dude. Thank you. Try to rip a tree out of the
02:10:58.80 --> 02:11:05.36 ground once. Probably. He did. Someone convinced and then he could he couldn't pull a tree out of
02:11:05.36 --> 02:11:09.76 the ground. So he tried. Yeah, Jeremy, probably tried it. Come in some of that. I think you're right on that.
02:11:09.76 --> 02:11:16.24 Yeah. Yeah. Really. Also the second thing, what did they find out? Why you, you had like, you weren't
02:11:16.24 --> 02:11:23.12 pretty pretty. Yeah. Just the, the Batutary gland. I'm the sacram, my Batutary gland was damaged and
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:28.24 just you're pretty bad. From the, from the blast or something. Yeah, from from that blast and just
02:11:28.24 --> 02:11:32.32 multiple other like explosions and blasts overseas. I mean, we used breaching charges that open
02:11:32.32 --> 02:11:36.72 up doors. You know, you were hearing a gunfight in the machine gun is legitimately going on
02:11:36.72 --> 02:11:40.88 to bring this your head. That's providing like, crushing that. There's times after gunfights,
02:11:40.88 --> 02:11:45.28 like I felt like I was just drunk. Yeah. And I felt like I was drunk just because I was just out of
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:51.28 it. And so just that much and then just combat sports and other stuff like that. And so, um,
02:11:51.28 --> 02:11:56.40 you know, when an anophiling got me to go to the VA to get my levels tested, you know, normal male
02:11:56.40 --> 02:12:04.56 or supposed to be between 600 to 900. I was 81. Yeah. That was bad. And they were just like,
02:12:04.56 --> 02:12:09.12 how, like, they called. I didn't answer my phone because I was at work. And I was on the
02:12:09.12 --> 02:12:12.56 alone or something like that. And they called a man that like, he needs to come back in right away.
02:12:12.56 --> 02:12:17.04 So, of course, they freak my wife out, right? She thinks I'm dying or something like that. Like
02:12:17.76 --> 02:12:24.08 and then so I go and I get it retested again. It was 87. And they're like, are you on steroids right now?
02:12:24.08 --> 02:12:29.68 I'm like, look at me. Like a monster. Now, granted, like when I was younger, you know, I'd
02:12:29.68 --> 02:12:33.84 take in some real strong supplements from like max muscle in different places like that that how
02:12:33.84 --> 02:12:40.48 I'm available. And I'm sure that mine have had an effect, but you know, I don't know. I mean,
02:12:40.48 --> 02:12:45.12 I know. I know. I like, I try to like get, you know, so, oh, not some of them is like, you know,
02:12:45.12 --> 02:12:49.76 because Jocker used to joke is like, JP just wants to be 205 pounds walking around. Yeah,
02:12:49.76 --> 02:12:54.80 nothing wrong with that. Oh, no, I wish I could get down to two of them. But, you know,
02:12:54.80 --> 02:12:58.08 um, so yeah, my levels were really messed up. And they're like, how do you even get out of that? How
02:12:58.08 --> 02:13:03.84 you do this, and this, I'm like, um, oh, I have a family I have to provide for. I really don't have
02:13:03.84 --> 02:13:08.96 another option. So just gotta get out there and get after it. We call that BTA just BTF and
02:13:08.96 --> 02:13:14.32 throughout the day. Yeah, that's crazy. And that's another part. Remember how we talk about where
02:13:15.28 --> 02:13:19.36 that's the part that you don't really hear that much about. Just those little detail like that you say
02:13:19.36 --> 02:13:23.04 in a gunfight if the machine gun is right here. And it hits you. Kind of like someone's hitting
02:13:23.04 --> 02:13:29.52 you physically. You know, it's a shock to your system. Yeah. I mean, I've been, uh, I was actually going
02:13:29.52 --> 02:13:34.40 through some videos and I'll try to get you guys some of these daily day where I'm laying down
02:13:34.40 --> 02:13:40.64 on the sniper rifle and we're in a big firefight and they come and straddle over me to start
02:13:40.64 --> 02:13:47.28 firing off rockets. And I'm getting that blast coming down just crushing me. You know, and then
02:13:47.28 --> 02:13:52.80 my key, you know, right next to me, the A-Dab gun is like, uh, I'm just like, oh my goodness,
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:57.20 I'm like, like, me coloring grants or Christmas next year is something like, yeah. By the way,
02:13:57.20 --> 02:14:02.24 when you fire a rocket in training, you put on two levels of ear protection. I had none.
02:14:04.40 --> 02:14:09.52 You don't need your prone combat. Your ears naturally squeeze. It's pretty awesome.
02:14:10.80 --> 02:14:16.56 Yeah. Yeah. I remember, um, one of my friends went who went through sniper school too. He
02:14:16.56 --> 02:14:21.60 talked about the, um, I think it was like the 50 kelp. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, brother,
02:14:21.60 --> 02:14:25.92 thing is like, just shooting it is like you're getting punched in the face. Oh, yeah. Just shooting
02:14:25.92 --> 02:14:31.60 it. Yeah. Well, I mean, considering we mount those to the tops of hummers and if you don't have
02:14:31.60 --> 02:14:36.72 your foot on the break and it's in part, it'll move the vehicle and even that, and you see a vehicle
02:14:36.72 --> 02:14:43.04 going to do, like just moving like, and you know, I was also a lead driver. So there's times
02:14:43.04 --> 02:14:46.80 where the machine, like 50 cows right over us in the front, like the barrels like sticking out and
02:14:46.80 --> 02:14:51.60 you're getting that blast, you know, like, oh, I mean, it's just put it's part of it. You know what I mean?
02:14:51.60 --> 02:14:56.48 Like I would not change any of that. Yeah. For crazy. I felt like those details like to, to someone
02:14:56.48 --> 02:15:00.88 who hasn't met, that's kind of a big deal. Because you watch movies and the guy shooting and
02:15:00.88 --> 02:15:04.56 like, reaching across the guy shooting the guy in the street corner and all this stuff. And then
02:15:04.56 --> 02:15:09.68 if you know those details, you're like, whoa, whoa, you skipped over this whole big kind of element
02:15:09.68 --> 02:15:14.32 of this situation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I just, some of you're spec, you know, the guys that are
02:15:14.32 --> 02:15:19.84 still on the team. So you know, I just did under 12 years in the Navy. I didn't, I didn't do my
02:15:19.84 --> 02:15:27.04 full time. You look at these guys. I do 20, 22, 25 years. Like, I'm just like, do the hats off to those
02:15:27.04 --> 02:15:31.68 guys, you know? And like the guys that are still, same guys that I deployed with. You know, it's
02:15:31.68 --> 02:15:37.04 weird me talking about it. Like, I didn't think special, like, as a team we did something special.
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:40.24 Yeah. And those guys are still in the fight. You know, they're still deploying, they're still doing
02:15:40.24 --> 02:15:45.12 workups. You know, they're battling divorces. They're, you know, dealing with new babies being born and,
02:15:45.12 --> 02:15:51.20 you know, taking care of their wives and your family. And it's just, like, just so much respect to those guys.
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:56.24 And then you know, you look at all the other branches that we surf with. And with those guys, just
02:15:56.24 --> 02:16:01.76 do 18 month appointments. 18 month appointments. 18 month appointments. Hey, you get to go home for
02:16:01.76 --> 02:16:06.08 two weeks halfway through. Yeah. Guys are going home to like their families move out. Yeah.
02:16:06.08 --> 02:16:12.000 Just go on. Like, not all but I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, a couple of guys came
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.56 home and they came back and from all leaving. I was like, how was it? Is like, oh my wife and
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:22.64 kids are gone? I don't know where you're my stuff is. I'm like, so Jack, do you want to hug? I don't know
02:16:22.64 --> 02:16:28.40 to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it is, you know, JP and I were talking about that earlier. Like,
02:16:28.40 --> 02:16:37.92 like, we're visible. Well, I'm definitely visible. And I was telling JP, like, you will now be
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:42.88 visible. More visible. I mean, he's been maintained a pretty low profile and trying to, yeah, because
02:16:42.88 --> 02:16:48.08 if you're fighting has a little bit of profile, but like, you know, you're going to be more visible.
02:16:48.08 --> 02:16:55.60 And when you get visible, people automatically think that you're special in some way. And like,
02:16:55.60 --> 02:17:01.20 I'm telling you, there's nothing special here. Definitely not for me because, you know, like,
02:17:01.20 --> 02:17:06.56 like, I did 20 years in the Navy, but okay, great. There's guys that do 30 years that guys that do
02:17:06.56 --> 02:17:11.76 14 different deployments. There's guys that, you know, get wounded. And then you like JP just said,
02:17:11.76 --> 02:17:18.72 you branch that out to all the services. And you know, I'm another guy and we're just other guys
02:17:18.72 --> 02:17:25.52 where we have a little bit of a of a higher profile. But that's not due to our, you know, anything
02:17:25.52 --> 02:17:30.24 special that we did just just with a way thing shook out of the end. So I always want to make that
02:17:30.24 --> 02:17:35.28 clear. And like law enforcement, they're doing it every day. Like my uncle. I was telling you about,
02:17:35.28 --> 02:17:40.32 like, every day. Now we do a work up. And then we just go get after for six months and come on to
02:17:40.32 --> 02:17:45.92 work up, go get after it. But he's like legitimately getting after it every day for 15 plus years.
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:53.76 You know, like it's a 23 year deployment. Yeah, to a combat. Yeah. With limited resources, limited support,
02:17:53.76 --> 02:18:00.16 and then the training, limited training and in an, a hostile environment on both the criminal
02:18:00.16 --> 02:18:05.12 side and actually oftentimes on the civil side, you know, people that are, you know,
02:18:05.12 --> 02:18:13.20 lash out at police officers from that whole other angle now. So yeah, unfortunate.
02:18:15.20 --> 02:18:16.80 You done with your questions, Mr. Charles.
02:18:16.80 --> 02:18:25.44 Oh, for now. Okay. But I do have good news though. You do. My career oil came in. Oh,
02:18:25.44 --> 02:18:30.40 got that. That's good news. That is good news. We are happy about that. You take a
02:18:30.40 --> 02:18:36.16 real one. I take shark cartilage. Sure. Is that the same thing? No, that's like what,
02:18:36.16 --> 02:18:41.92 glucose. No, it's good for your dormitory. My, my dad got me on it, but I'll, I'll get on what you

02:19:00.24 --> 02:19:05.28 down to support the podcast, yeah, chain of yours, because you're here, yeah, go on it dot com slash

02:19:13.12 --> 02:19:18.48 one asked me, uh, this is, night yesterday, day before like, they're like, hey, I know, I know,
02:19:18.48 --> 02:19:22.72 you know, you guys are done with on it and all that stuff. But is that the only supplements
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:29.68 you take for real? That's like, yeah, that is. Creole oil, alpha brain sometimes,
02:19:29.68 --> 02:19:35.04 shrimp tech. Warrior bars, too, but I don't know if that's a supplement. Anyway, those are
02:19:35.04 --> 02:19:41.04 so good. Yeah, definitely supplements. Your, your, your need food and take. Yeah, yeah,
02:19:41.04 --> 02:19:46.80 big time tasty. But yeah, you can support that way. If you're in the mood to also the Amazon,
02:19:46.80 --> 02:19:50.72 if you, this kind of, I'm, I'm just trying to analyze the whole Amazon thing. Like, how, how does
02:19:50.72 --> 02:19:54.72 that kind of fit in the whole, I mean, we kind of know how, but okay, so you click through when you
02:19:54.72 --> 02:19:59.36 do your shopping on Amazon, you click through for you to your shopping. Through the website,
02:19:59.36 --> 02:20:06.72 not a jackbuck, as.com or jocostor.com. So, I'm, you support that way, but so how does this fit in?
02:20:06.72 --> 02:20:12.80 Right. So it's kind of like, okay, we're here putting out this message, right? And people who
02:20:12.80 --> 02:20:16.08 like, click through, they buy shirts or something like that, they're kind of like the backup,
02:20:16.08 --> 02:20:20.48 kind of like the reinforcement, you know? They're actually the full on supporting mechanism,
02:20:20.48 --> 02:20:24.32 never mind the backup. Yeah, so they're all in the field. Right.
02:20:24.32 --> 02:20:28.16 Battle field. So, back up is that's a bad one. That's like, they're like the reinforcement,
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:32.000 you know? They're the full on support mechanism. They're the reinforcement. Yes, the
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:38.24 reinforcement. Yes, very good. Very good. And yeah, I'm, and so, so the Amazon click through,
02:20:38.24 --> 02:20:44.08 that's a good one. Good way to support this podcast support. And of course, subscribe, right?
02:20:44.08 --> 02:20:49.04 Yes. Yeah, I used it. Yeah, you did use it. So, I should, I'm getting asked this a lot, right?
02:20:49.04 --> 02:20:53.76 Yeah. And I'm not, I was going to lay out there. So podcast, you bought, where is that come from?
02:20:53.76 --> 02:20:59.60 Yeah. The really quick story. Here's where it comes from. Mm-hmm. There's a guy whose name is
02:20:59.60 --> 02:21:04.000 Hennach Lardach. Hennach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach Lardach.
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.76 Just for clearing. Okay, for clearing. But those of us that speak with a fake Portuguese accent
02:21:09.76 --> 02:21:13.52 from time to time would just say, Hennach. Right. Right. Yeah, that's the right way. So anyways,
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:23.04 there's a video production company called Flexpoint videos, which is, which is Echo Charles's company,
02:21:23.04 --> 02:21:33.04 and they did a series that starred this Brazilian Gittizu master, Hennach Lardach. And my son
02:21:33.92 --> 02:21:41.84 actually was very into the Hennach program. And they're, in, being into the program,
02:21:41.84 --> 02:21:49.20 he started to adapt his own fake Brazilian Portuguese accent. Yes. And since he speaks no Portuguese
02:21:49.20 --> 02:22:00.08 whatsoever, he just simply does the, the pigeon of it. And he adds words or, or parts to words
02:22:00.08 --> 02:22:06.72 that he thinks in his mind sound like they might be Portuguese. So one day he said to me in a
02:22:06.72 --> 02:22:16.40 broken, imitated fake Portuguese accent. He said, that, are you going to record that podcast Shiboha?
02:22:16.40 --> 02:22:24.32 Ah. And I said, yes, I am. And then that is where it came from. It doesn't mean anything.
02:22:24.88 --> 02:22:33.84 It doesn't have any spelling. It's just my 13 year old son with his comedic vibe going on.
02:22:33.84 --> 02:22:40.72 Yeah. So he, and so, but he, where he, how he got that from, or what he got that from is
02:22:40.72 --> 02:22:47.36 podcast, that's like the podcast. And then Paul Ha and Boa, this two things. Right. Right.
02:22:47.36 --> 02:22:52.40 Paul Ha is like this expression. It's like, it means something specific, but it's, it's ultimately
02:22:52.40 --> 02:22:57.60 it's an expression. But ultimately, let's be clear here. It's also a very bad word. Yes, yes.
02:22:57.60 --> 02:23:04.40 It's like the worst swear word. It's a very bad swear word in Portuguese. Yeah, that's
02:23:04.40 --> 02:23:11.12 Paul Ha. Yeah. It's like slang. It's, it's a mix. Yeah. So there's that then there's Boa, which means good.
02:23:11.12 --> 02:23:16.40 Oh, I mean it's good. Exactly. So, you know, your son's thing, I don't know if it was
02:23:16.40 --> 02:23:21.04 Paul Ha or Boa, I'm assuming, Paul Ha because Henato says, Paul Ha all the time. Yeah.
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:25.20 So that's what he says. Boy, from time to time. Yeah. And my son, when he says it,
02:23:25.60 --> 02:23:31.36 it's podcast Shiboha. Yeah. So I'm not 100% sure. Yeah. But that's where it came from. Yeah.
02:23:31.36 --> 02:23:35.52 When we got a listen to that podcast Shiboha right here. Yeah. That's what we're going to do.
02:23:36.08 --> 02:23:41.20 That's crazy what our kids say. Yes. It's indeed. And still when you think of it, that's still
02:23:41.20 --> 02:23:46.80 kind of an ambiguous explanation. Really. So where does that leave us? You know, like, okay. So what is
02:23:46.80 --> 02:23:53.44 him? The thing is is, I don't know. Although, I guess it does mean that we're talking about this
02:23:53.44 --> 02:24:00.64 particular. Yeah. We're excited about it. Yes, we are. There it is. Oh. So
02:24:00.64 --> 02:24:06.48 back to the support thing. You know, subscribe if you haven't already. That's a good way to stay
02:24:06.48 --> 02:24:12.32 in the game. You know, when the new one comes out, just pull on your phone. Listen, ready. I know I am.
02:24:13.68 --> 02:24:20.48 Me too. And I'm on it. YouTube channel, video coming out. I think I'm going to do a more of a comedy
02:24:20.48 --> 02:24:24.48 video. See how that goes over. Well, won't go over well with me, obviously.
02:24:24.48 --> 02:24:32.24 Yeah. Hey, we've got the the heavy podcast that everybody loves it and let's get after it.
02:24:32.24 --> 02:24:36.24 And let's crush people and let's do the darkness and you're going to do a comedy video. Is that where we're going
02:24:36.24 --> 02:24:41.44 with this? Yeah. All right. Just the CL goes over. We'll trust that judgment. I guess.
02:24:42.64 --> 02:24:48.64 Let the troopers decide on that one. Yeah. Also, jocco store. That's where, you know, we
02:24:48.64 --> 02:24:54.96 sling these shirts. But it's less about selling shirts. It's more about, hey, if you want to support the podcast,
02:24:54.96 --> 02:24:59.68 you want to wear cool shirt with multiple layers. By the way, I talk about the layers, but let's just say,
02:24:59.68 --> 02:25:05.60 I don't want to go into a big thing about the layers. But there's more to it than just the saying,
02:25:05.60 --> 02:25:09.04 you know, discipline equals free. And what does that even mean? It sounds cool. What does that mean?
02:25:09.04 --> 02:25:13.36 Anyway, there's a meaning darkness doesn't meaning and all the shirts have. Of course, the
02:25:13.36 --> 02:25:19.04 meaning behind the t-shirt that says, the one that you're wearing with it just says jocco podcast. That's just
02:25:19.04 --> 02:25:24.48 the name. Well, if you look on the back, you can see the meaning. Oh, there you go. What are you going to find
02:25:24.48 --> 02:25:30.000 about? That's the layers I'm talking about. You know, women stuff coming out, take tops are already
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.76 out, but the women's t-shirts are coming out as well. Just going to give all the girls or the women
02:25:35.76 --> 02:25:40.64 and a small update. Some girls with some women are at the mustard. They certainly are. Asking
02:25:40.64 --> 02:25:48.72 about some stuff, I told enforce. That's some new patches. The two, the three by two, so they can
02:25:48.72 --> 02:25:56.16 fit on the standard Velcro situation. And I think, and there's like a tan color, right? It's like the
02:25:56.16 --> 02:26:02.80 official color that's good for the troopers that are going out. The desert. I'm right. That's FDE,
02:26:02.80 --> 02:26:10.000 federal dark earth. Yeah. Good, because I was trying to Google that and find out and there's a bunch of
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:17.28 them. Yeah, FDE. I got the new sig 320 in. So sick. And of course, I had to get one for Amanda.
02:26:18.48 --> 02:26:26.88 So each have sig 320 compact FDE. Yeah. Actually, that's coincidentally really helpful. I was
02:26:26.88 --> 02:26:33.36 looking for a long time for that. Awesome. Yeah. Rascar's a good two. Look at them. Multiple layers
02:26:33.36 --> 02:26:39.60 like I said. Just trust me on that. And that, those, by the way, it's just support if you're in the
02:26:39.60 --> 02:26:45.36 market. You can also support the podcast by buying some darker YT. Yes. If you want to
02:26:46.24 --> 02:26:56.000 just improve every single aspect of your life. No, if you want to get some tea, you can get it. If you
02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.72 don't think you like tea, you probably will like this tea because even though it's technically
02:27:00.72 --> 02:27:07.44 tea, it doesn't actually even taste like tea. It tastes like a nectar that you need to try.
02:27:08.16 --> 02:27:13.20 I can't explain it. I agree with that. I did a lot of last couple of days. Yeah. And the
02:27:13.20 --> 02:27:20.24 mustard and man, I was awesome. It's tasty. And plus as we know from the Amazon
02:27:20.24 --> 02:27:31.28 reviews, it is added. There's a guy who deadlift went from 400 pounds to 8,000 pounds. That's a
02:27:31.28 --> 02:27:40.32 7,600 pound increase. In your deadlift. And so that's right there. Again, that's good to go.
02:27:40.32 --> 02:27:48.000 So get yourself some Amazon tea. Also when you're on Amazon, you can pick up, you can get yourself
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.60 a copy of a book called Extreme Ownership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin. And the thing is,
02:27:53.60 --> 02:27:59.84 if you have a copy, that's cool. Get a couple more. You want to have them on standby because sometimes
02:27:59.84 --> 02:28:03.28 you're just dealing with someone at work and all of a sudden you realize that they're not taking
02:28:03.28 --> 02:28:07.76 ownership of something. It's no problem. You're not stressed out. You're just reaching your
02:28:07.76 --> 02:28:12.000 desk and you grab a copy. You go, hey, one to take a quick look at this right here. Up the chain
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.24 command down the chain of command. Now when you do that, now will be you're going to make their life better
02:28:18.24 --> 02:28:21.60 because they're going to be able to figure some stuff out. You're also going to make your life easier
02:28:21.60 --> 02:28:30.16 because now you're surrounding personnel are in the game. And you're taking extreme ownership
02:28:30.16 --> 02:28:34.08 in and of it. So that's actually because we're making it. Not like a lot of people. That's the question.
02:28:34.08 --> 02:28:37.44 That is deep. No, because that's the question people have there be like, hey, what do I do when
02:28:37.44 --> 02:28:41.28 my colleague is not taking extreme ownership? You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah. See,
02:28:41.28 --> 02:28:46.16 the just the near nature of you saying, hey, you're not taking extreme ownership. That's you're not
02:28:46.16 --> 02:28:52.40 taking extreme ownership. So now you're only at your saying, hey, I recognize this situation of you
02:28:52.40 --> 02:28:57.60 doing and not doing certain things. Let me take action. What can I do to take extreme ownership
02:28:57.60 --> 02:29:04.08 over this situation? But it's true. That is true. That is true. Also, you know, as you are on Amazon,
02:29:04.08 --> 02:29:12.56 just just nod your head a little bit and say thanks to Brady Lanter, Brady Trooper, who has been
02:29:13.04 --> 02:29:20.48 the backside support to the podcast. She bohaha with all kinds of stuff. So shout out to Brady for
02:29:21.68 --> 02:29:26.88 getting after it. Technically, he's getting after it technically. Technically.
02:29:26.88 --> 02:29:30.88 I think they end up going to do it. Now you just talked about the mustard too. We just had to
02:29:30.88 --> 02:29:37.68 mustard and San Diego, California. It was freaking awesome. Yes. It was really cool. We had a bunch of
02:29:37.68 --> 02:29:44.000 people there. The guy that helped run the event and they met, he's going to run an event for
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:50.08 20 something years. And he came up to me two hours into the event. You know, this is after people
02:29:50.08 --> 02:29:54.24 were peating at 445 in the morning. This is after everyone was in their seats at 0800,
02:29:54.24 --> 02:29:58.56 ready standing by to get after it. No stragglers. Like, like, when I say no stragglers, I mean,
02:29:58.56 --> 02:30:05.28 no stragglers. 0 350 people boom in their seats, ready to rock and roll. He came out to me.
02:30:05.28 --> 02:30:10.56 During the first little break and he says, I've actually never seen anything like this. We're
02:30:10.56 --> 02:30:16.80 an entire conference is so just on board in the game and getting after it. He said, never seen this
02:30:16.80 --> 02:30:27.20 in any kind of conference. And so major prep. And yeah, come down. The schedule says, hey,
02:30:27.20 --> 02:30:32.08 echo, film some stuff. Right. That's the thing. Kind of the loose order. Commanders in.
02:30:32.08 --> 02:30:38.24 And look at this schedule. Hey, four of optional. Optional 445 workout and okay, I'm
02:30:38.24 --> 02:30:43.04 beyond it. So I'm not used to the 445. It's cool. Don't get it wrong. But I'm not just not used
02:30:43.04 --> 02:30:49.04 to 445 filming work workouts, whatever. Being awake. So I'm like, you know what I'm going to do?
02:30:49.04 --> 02:30:52.96 I'm going to go. I'm going to show up on time. I'm going to show up ahead of time. But really,
02:30:52.96 --> 02:30:58.000 though, optional, really first day. Let's face it. How many people are really going to be at this
02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:04.000 thing? Maybe 25 or 30. I'm thinking. And pan traveling to 20. Yeah, I mean, yeah, we had guys from
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.80 UK, you know, five different countries were represented 42 different states like it was insane.
02:31:10.80 --> 02:31:16.64 So they were all over. Yeah. There's no way. I was like, I was even, I'm not a morning person.
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:21.04 Like you. Like I'm usually got that's up and told two or three working on stuff. Yeah. So I was like,
02:31:21.04 --> 02:31:24.32 I'm going to get up. I was like, yeah, I'm here with Jock on life. I mean, that's all. I've got to
02:31:24.32 --> 02:31:29.12 get after it. I was like, I'm going to be pissed. There's like five people out there. Yeah, I'm thinking
02:31:29.12 --> 02:31:35.60 10. I'm 20. It would be solid. But I pulled right. And I'm ahead of time. By the way, I'm pulling
02:31:35.60 --> 02:31:42.000 up like 428, you know, 429. I come around on the corner and I see a straight up riot. Like,
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:48.08 not rioting. But like the type of crowd that's like, you know, in a protest or something. Which
02:31:48.08 --> 02:31:53.20 guy stretching, you know, I'm like, dang. So I go at a park lake on the side. I come and you guys
02:31:53.20 --> 02:31:57.20 already had worked out. Yeah. Yeah. So what people would lay for. I read. Yeah. What lay for
02:31:57.20 --> 02:32:04.96 I do is we went. I said, hey, life, we might get contingency is there's a 150 people. We're not
02:32:04.96 --> 02:32:09.84 going to be able to direct this thing if we're doing it. We need to get leadership position. So we
02:32:09.84 --> 02:32:15.36 need to go work out before the 04445 must work out. We need to go work out before that. Optional
02:32:15.36 --> 02:32:21.52 then. So we went and hit it before. And it's a pretty hard core workout. One of those workouts
02:32:21.52 --> 02:32:27.28 where it can suck as much as you want the suck. And of course, we wanted to suck that. So we were
02:32:27.28 --> 02:32:31.28 dripping with sweat. We come walking over. And it's the same thing for us. We are walking back
02:32:31.28 --> 02:32:36.32 from the workout area, which was down by the San Diego Convention Center. We're walking back to the
02:32:36.32 --> 02:32:42.24 hotel. We're in a little jog. We turn the corner. Now we're really close. We start walking. And we see
02:32:42.24 --> 02:32:48.40 the same thing. We see like all these people. And it was, you know, 250 or 300 people are
02:32:48.40 --> 02:32:54.80 ready to rock and roll at four. It's only 428. It's not even us. It's nighttime. It's not even
02:32:54.80 --> 02:33:00.000 nighttime. It's not nighttime. It's straight up nighttime. So we got after it. And that was a good
02:33:00.72 --> 02:33:07.60 representation of the attitude that was at the master. And the other funny thing was people kept
02:33:07.60 --> 02:33:11.44 it. When people asked questions, they'd say, oh, I just got promoted in this new position.
02:33:11.44 --> 02:33:16.16 And this is going on. And then someone else said, you know, I just got promoted three times
02:33:16.16 --> 02:33:20.40 in the last six months. And I want to know. And so you're thinking, okay, all these people are
02:33:20.40 --> 02:33:26.96 just fast-tracked. They're in the game. They're on it. It's just, it was, it was really an awesome event.
02:33:26.96 --> 02:33:33.36 Great job with the video, Eko Charles made some really killer videos for that. And it was awesome.
02:33:33.36 --> 02:33:38.32 Those videos were awesome. Like very captivating. You know, me sitting there in the crowd.
02:33:38.32 --> 02:33:42.56 Yeah. It was just like, other than the couple of times, I had to get up and the first
02:33:42.56 --> 02:33:47.12 test stood in the back, first sat in the back, and I had to get up and I'd pace. Because I was
02:33:47.12 --> 02:33:51.20 just like so connected. It was just brought me back, you know, or just emotional connection. And
02:33:51.20 --> 02:33:54.96 you know, everyone else in the same thing. And the second day I'm sitting up in front row. I was like,
02:33:54.96 --> 02:33:59.36 I can't stand up in pace right now. But just everyone, you just watch other people and just
02:33:59.36 --> 02:34:05.84 do great job. Those videos were insane man. You were in one of them. I know. I had the
02:34:05.84 --> 02:34:11.52 doctor's mask on, so nobody recommended it. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody asked me about it. They're like,
02:34:12.80 --> 02:34:19.44 pretty blonde in the gown and twins, babies and my get-up. Yeah, that's right. That's the rough transition
02:34:19.44 --> 02:34:26.08 video. Yeah. So the rough transition, Tristan video that Eko made is the person holding the baby.
02:34:26.08 --> 02:34:33.12 The baby. The babies. Yeah. That's JP, right, Jerry. So there's a little layer right there.
02:34:33.12 --> 02:34:37.20 Is there a little enough? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Yeah. If you're kind of on the
02:34:37.20 --> 02:34:40.64 inside, you're going to see them. You're going to recognize them. That's kind of the fun part. One of
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:48.64 the many fun parts. Awesome. And also, so if you like what we're talking about here, and you want to
02:34:48.64 --> 02:34:53.68 continue, maybe you didn't get enough of this today. You want to keep talking to us. You can actually

02:37:10.72 --> 02:37:16.16 thanks for everything you've ever done for me, brother. I appreciate above and beyond anything I could
02:37:16.16 --> 02:37:23.76 have ever hoped for the kind of performance and the kind of the kind of attitude and the
02:37:23.76 --> 02:37:31.92 bravery and the courage always. Thank you. Thank you. Always. Thank you.
02:37:34.72 --> 02:37:41.68 And you know, the other day when we were at the master, we were in that big ground. And we had kind
02:37:41.68 --> 02:37:45.68 of, we kind of turned the corner and we were getting to the area where we were going to start the
02:37:45.68 --> 02:37:51.44 work out thing. And I knew I was so obsessed real quick. I said, I'm going to need some help
02:37:51.44 --> 02:37:56.32 getting some organization stuff going on here. And we really didn't have a plan for 300 people, right?
02:37:56.32 --> 02:38:02.000 We had a plan for 30 or 40 people. Wait, different. And so I'm sitting there and I'm going into,
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:06.56 okay, what am I going to do? Got a prioritize next. I need some help. And it's just dark, you know,
02:38:06.56 --> 02:38:14.64 dark four o'clock in the morning. So, I just yell out, I go, J.P. And instantly, I hear some distance
02:38:14.64 --> 02:38:19.76 away I hear. Yes, sir. And I look up where that came from and I see J.P. And he like made
02:38:19.76 --> 02:38:25.44 quick eye contact when you're seeing moving, you know, down the stairs, he's coming to me. And in that
02:38:25.44 --> 02:38:35.36 split second, that split second, I remembered all the times that I had called your name. And I had
02:38:35.36 --> 02:38:45.20 asked you to do what needed to be done. You always stepped up without question, without, without regard
02:38:45.20 --> 02:38:52.80 for your safety or for your own security. You always stepped up just with your, the mission,
02:38:53.76 --> 02:39:04.40 and the team and your brothers in mind. Always putting others before yourself, but so many others
02:39:04.40 --> 02:39:19.36 in our task unit did. Mark and Mikey and Ryan and like the many soldiers and marines did
02:39:20.08 --> 02:39:28.24 in the battle of Ramadi and in the rest of Iraq and in Afghanistan and on battlefields all over
02:39:28.24 --> 02:39:42.96 the world throughout history, putting others before themselves with their heads held high.
02:39:42.96 --> 02:40:01.92 And everyone else that is out there listening, think about that. Think about putting the mission
02:40:01.92 --> 02:40:18.88 before your own needs. Think about putting others before yourself and think about walking through the
02:40:18.88 --> 02:40:28.48 world with all the threats and challenges in front of you. Think about walking through the daily
02:40:28.48 --> 02:40:41.76 battles that you face with your back straight and your head held high facing the threat,
02:40:44.24 --> 02:40:54.24 facing the fear, scanning for what is next so you can engage and get after it.
02:40:54.24 --> 02:41:10.16 So until next time, this is echo and jocco and my brother J. P. Denell out.
