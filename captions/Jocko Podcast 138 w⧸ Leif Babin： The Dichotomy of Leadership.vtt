00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.64
This is Jockel Podcast number 138.

2
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:08.84
With echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.

3
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:09.84
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:12.84
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.84 --> 00:00:18.64
Sir, the young seal whispered in a faint voice.

6
00:00:18.64 --> 00:00:20.68
Come here.

7
00:00:20.68 --> 00:00:24.84
Our hands were clasped in hand shake.

8
00:00:24.84 --> 00:00:30.72
On a formal handshake like two businessmen, but palm to palm with thumbs wrapped around

9
00:00:30.72 --> 00:00:38.68
the back of the hand like an arm wrestling contest, a handshake of brotherhood.

10
00:00:38.68 --> 00:00:41.72
The young seal was feeling the morphine.

11
00:00:41.72 --> 00:00:45.20
I saw it as eyes, but he was still there.

12
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:48.68
Still conscious and aware.

13
00:00:48.68 --> 00:00:58.20
He was everything a young man should be smart, brave, athletic, funny, loyal and tough.

14
00:00:58.20 --> 00:01:03.16
He had been shot in the leg about a half an hour before.

15
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:08.64
I found out later that Mikey Montsour, a young seal machine gunner, had run out into heavy

16
00:01:08.64 --> 00:01:14.84
enemy gunfire and drag this seal out of a war torn street in the Malab district in the city

17
00:01:14.84 --> 00:01:20.96
of Ramadi, the violent heart of the insurgency in Iraq.

18
00:01:20.96 --> 00:01:27.52
The wounded seal now lay on a gurney and Charlie Medd, the camp Ramadi field hospital

19
00:01:27.52 --> 00:01:32.52
where US military surgical teams worked furiously to save the lives of gravely wounded

20
00:01:32.52 --> 00:01:36.76
troops almost every day.

21
00:01:36.76 --> 00:01:45.36
The bullet, a mammoth armor piercing 7.62 by 54 millimeter round with a steel core, had entered

22
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:51.32
his leg at the lower thigh, ripped the part flesh and bone inside his leg and exited in

23
00:01:51.32 --> 00:01:56.72
his upper thigh close to the groin.

24
00:01:56.72 --> 00:02:02.48
It was hard to say if he would keep his leg from the looks of the wound.

25
00:02:02.48 --> 00:02:05.88
My guess was no.

26
00:02:05.88 --> 00:02:09.60
He would lose it.

27
00:02:09.60 --> 00:02:15.68
The wounded seals grip on my hand tightened and he pulled me in, drawing me just inches

28
00:02:15.68 --> 00:02:18.20
from his face.

29
00:02:18.20 --> 00:02:24.04
I could tell he wanted to say something to me so I turned and put my ear to his next to his

30
00:02:24.04 --> 00:02:26.40
mouth.

31
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:30.16
I wasn't sure what to expect.

32
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:35.48
Was he scared or angry or depressed that he might lose his leg?

33
00:02:35.48 --> 00:02:37.88
Was he nervous about what might happen next?

34
00:02:37.88 --> 00:02:42.12
Was he confused?

35
00:02:42.12 --> 00:02:50.40
He took a breath and then whispered, sir, let me stay.

36
00:02:50.40 --> 00:02:51.40
Let me stay.

37
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:53.16
Please don't make me go home.

38
00:02:53.16 --> 00:02:54.16
I'll do anything.

39
00:02:54.16 --> 00:02:55.72
I'll sweep up around the camp.

40
00:02:55.72 --> 00:02:57.04
I can heal here.

41
00:02:57.04 --> 00:02:58.04
Please.

42
00:02:58.04 --> 00:02:59.04
Please.

43
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:04.72
Please stay with the task unit.

44
00:03:04.72 --> 00:03:07.52
There you go.

45
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:15.08
Not scared, not angry, not depressed that he might lose his leg.

46
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:21.40
Only concerned that he might have to leave our task unit.

47
00:03:21.40 --> 00:03:23.72
Task unit bruiser.

48
00:03:23.72 --> 00:03:25.32
Our task unit.

49
00:03:25.32 --> 00:03:28.16
Our lives.

50
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:33.08
This seal was our first significant casualty.

51
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:36.84
We had had guys catch some frag on previous operations.

52
00:03:36.84 --> 00:03:40.40
We had had some very close calls.

53
00:03:40.40 --> 00:03:45.44
This was the first seal wounded from task unit bruiser whose life would be forever changed

54
00:03:45.44 --> 00:03:49.92
by a grave combat injury.

55
00:03:49.92 --> 00:03:54.16
Even if he kept his leg, the damage was so substantial that it didn't seem possible

56
00:03:54.16 --> 00:04:02.64
he would ever fully regain the extraordinary athleticism he had displayed previously.

57
00:04:02.64 --> 00:04:07.28
And yet this seal was only concerned that he would let me down.

58
00:04:07.28 --> 00:04:16.60
Let the task unit down, let his platoon and his team down.

59
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:20.48
This was a man.

60
00:04:20.48 --> 00:04:26.08
This was a true friend of brother.

61
00:04:26.08 --> 00:04:29.000
This was a hero.

62
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.88
Young, brave, and without question, more concerned for his friends than for his own life.

63
00:04:41.88 --> 00:04:45.12
I was moved.

64
00:04:45.12 --> 00:04:47.88
I felt tears wailing up in my eyes.

65
00:04:47.88 --> 00:04:55.16
I fought them back, then I swallowed the lump in my throat.

66
00:04:55.16 --> 00:04:59.64
This was no time to break down.

67
00:04:59.64 --> 00:05:05.20
I was supposed to be the leader.

68
00:05:05.20 --> 00:05:15.24
And he needed me to be strong.

69
00:05:15.24 --> 00:05:26.08
And that right there is from the opening chapter of a book called The Dicotomy of Leadership,

70
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:28.92
which is actually a new book.

71
00:05:28.92 --> 00:05:38.08
And it was written by me and my brother, Lave Babin, and Lave has been on this podcast

72
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:39.24
before.

73
00:05:39.24 --> 00:05:41.56
We wrote extreme ownership together.

74
00:05:41.56 --> 00:05:46.96
We obviously served in task unit, bruiser together.

75
00:05:46.96 --> 00:05:49.24
And he was on this podcast.

76
00:05:49.24 --> 00:05:50.80
He was the first guest.

77
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:54.96
He's been the guest the most times.

78
00:05:54.96 --> 00:05:55.96
He was on 11.

79
00:05:55.96 --> 00:05:58.80
He was on 34, 65, and 11, 14.

80
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:05.44
If you want to go get some background on Lave, but I'm glad to say that he is actually back

81
00:06:05.44 --> 00:06:07.44
here with us again.

82
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:09.72
It's a Lave Babin.

83
00:06:09.72 --> 00:06:10.72
Welcome back.

84
00:06:10.72 --> 00:06:11.72
It's going to be back.

85
00:06:11.72 --> 00:06:13.20
Thanks for having me on.

86
00:06:13.20 --> 00:06:14.72
Yeah, right home, man.

87
00:06:14.72 --> 00:06:21.24
And it's good to have you back because we're done writing and editing this book, which

88
00:06:21.24 --> 00:06:22.24
feels good.

89
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:23.24
It does feel good.

90
00:06:23.24 --> 00:06:27.04
It's been a lot of work, but it's been awesome, too.

91
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:29.64
And to be able to tell this kind of stories, I can just read.

92
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:35.80
And even though I've read that now a hundred times, it just takes me immediately back

93
00:06:35.80 --> 00:06:38.36
to that situation.

94
00:06:38.36 --> 00:06:41.60
And it's just extraordinary.

95
00:06:41.60 --> 00:06:45.88
We were able to work with some incredible, incredible seals like that young man.

96
00:06:45.88 --> 00:06:49.60
Yeah, no doubt about it.

97
00:06:49.60 --> 00:06:52.84
It's weird when you're writing a book.

98
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:55.28
And then you're rereading it and rereading it.

99
00:06:55.28 --> 00:07:02.56
And like you said, every time I would be reading these sections, you just get that, you

100
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:04.36
just can't help but go back there.

101
00:07:04.36 --> 00:07:05.68
You just can't help but go back there.

102
00:07:05.68 --> 00:07:07.88
And this was definitely there were some parts of this book.

103
00:07:07.88 --> 00:07:14.40
And I was writing that were definitely hard to write and even hard to edit.

104
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:16.72
You know, this, this being wonderful.

105
00:07:16.72 --> 00:07:22.28
And I'm glad that we're able to share the stories of guys like that.

106
00:07:22.28 --> 00:07:28.12
And that particular individual, which I don't talk about this in the book, but he kept

107
00:07:28.12 --> 00:07:30.04
his leg, thank God.

108
00:07:30.04 --> 00:07:37.84
And he kept getting after it for years and years.

109
00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:41.44
And he kept training Jiu Jitsu and he's a total stud maybe sometime.

110
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:43.68
He'll come on the podcast, who knows?

111
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:46.68
But what a great guy.

112
00:07:46.68 --> 00:07:56.08
Now you also kind of kicked off the book with what I thought was a solid way to kick it off.

113
00:07:56.08 --> 00:07:58.08
And you should go into that.

114
00:07:58.08 --> 00:08:02.24
I know we were trying to pick out some good sections here, but I thought the opener that

115
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:06.92
you put in, which you opened with the phrase that we've been using quite a bit lately.

116
00:08:06.92 --> 00:08:16.40
But kick off that introduction to the book, dichotomy leadership.

117
00:08:16.40 --> 00:08:17.68
Stand by to get some.

118
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:22.08
Said someone over the inner squad radio and the calm demeanor, you might expect a

119
00:08:22.08 --> 00:08:27.48
bit of a flight attendant telling airline passengers to stow their tray tables for landing.

120
00:08:27.48 --> 00:08:30.32
The street and front of us had emptied of people.

121
00:08:30.32 --> 00:08:34.16
Like magic, the local citizens had all suddenly disappeared.

122
00:08:34.16 --> 00:08:35.88
And we knew what that meant.

123
00:08:35.88 --> 00:08:38.16
Enemy attack was imminent.

124
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:42.04
The hair on the back of my neck stood at rigid attention.

125
00:08:42.04 --> 00:08:46.72
After many eviscious gunfighting Romadi, standby to get some was a running joke that

126
00:08:46.72 --> 00:08:49.96
eased attention right when we knew trouble was coming.

127
00:08:49.96 --> 00:08:54.60
The more nonchalantly it could be said, under the diarist of circumstances, the funnier

128
00:08:54.60 --> 00:08:56.56
it was.

129
00:08:56.56 --> 00:09:01.000
It was broad daylight as our patrol of seals and Iraqi soldiers made its way on foot

130
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.56
down the narrow city street, bordered by high concrete walls on both sides.

131
00:09:06.56 --> 00:09:09.32
Suddenly the world exploded.

132
00:09:09.32 --> 00:09:14.24
Dozens of bullets snap to the air, each with a sharp, supersonic crack, and smashed into

133
00:09:14.24 --> 00:09:17.72
the concrete wall next to me with thunderous impact.

134
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:20.000
The yards of concrete flew everywhere.

135
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.84
The heavy valleys of incoming fire sounded like multiple jack-hammers simultaneously

136
00:09:24.84 --> 00:09:28.84
chewing up the street and the walls all around us.

137
00:09:28.84 --> 00:09:32.12
We had walked right into an enemy bus saw.

138
00:09:32.12 --> 00:09:35.96
In surgeon fighters hit us from multiple directions with belt fed machine guns.

139
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:38.64
I couldn't see them or where they were shooting from.

140
00:09:38.64 --> 00:09:44.28
But the number of enemy bullets flying to the air around us was crazy.

141
00:09:44.28 --> 00:09:48.68
There was no place to hide, with high walls on both sides, the narrow south center of

142
00:09:48.68 --> 00:09:51.20
a mighty street provided no cover.

143
00:09:51.20 --> 00:09:55.72
The only thing between us and the enemy machine guns was a single parked car on the

144
00:09:55.72 --> 00:10:01.04
side of the road some distance up the block and the typical trash thrown about.

145
00:10:01.04 --> 00:10:03.56
The patrol was in a dual column formation.

146
00:10:03.56 --> 00:10:08.04
Each column split on opposite sides of the street, hookered close to the walls.

147
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:11.12
There was nothing to get behind that could protect us from bullets.

148
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:15.76
But we did have something on our side, devastating firepower.

149
00:10:15.76 --> 00:10:20.04
We fully expected a firefighter on every patrol into this enemy hill neighborhood and

150
00:10:20.04 --> 00:10:21.76
we rolled in heavy.

151
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:26.72
Each squad of eight seals packed at least four belt fed machine guns to suppress any enemy

152
00:10:26.72 --> 00:10:28.64
attack we encountered.

153
00:10:28.64 --> 00:10:33.52
When we came under fire, our immediate response with violent and overwhelming gunfire provided

154
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:35.04
the only answer.

155
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:36.96
Cover and move.

156
00:10:36.96 --> 00:10:40.72
Having learned through the humbling experience of months of urban combat, task unit

157
00:10:40.72 --> 00:10:45.28
rooser had had plenty of practice in this fundamental gun fighting principle.

158
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:50.40
Within nanoseconds, the seals with a big machine guns up front, unleash the most ruthless

159
00:10:50.40 --> 00:10:53.44
and lethal barrage of fire you can imagine.

160
00:10:53.44 --> 00:11:01.24
Despite the intensity and violence of the closer urban combat, I couldn't help but smile.

161
00:11:01.24 --> 00:11:02.24
Couldn't help but smile.

162
00:11:02.24 --> 00:11:06.56
Yeah, that's we've said this before, but obviously guys that have been too war usually

163
00:11:06.56 --> 00:11:09.64
that's the best thing in their life and the best experiences they've found in their lives

164
00:11:09.64 --> 00:11:15.96
and it gives you that type of feeling right there of where you can't help but smile.

165
00:11:15.96 --> 00:11:20.04
Then as I just talked about it and as we both know, it's also the worst days of our lives

166
00:11:20.04 --> 00:11:26.80
are also there and we know that people in the military all feel most of them feel the same

167
00:11:26.80 --> 00:11:33.16
way that you have your best days and your worst days there.

168
00:11:33.16 --> 00:11:36.32
It's interesting.

169
00:11:36.32 --> 00:11:41.72
Over and move, it always comes back to cover and move in these gun fights and you know

170
00:11:41.72 --> 00:11:46.92
a client we were working with recently and you know remember he switched around, cover

171
00:11:46.92 --> 00:11:53.04
and move and made it a second and put simple first and it's like well there's a reason

172
00:11:53.04 --> 00:11:57.000
why that exists that way cover move is first because if you're not working together

173
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.88
there's a team there's nothing to even keep simple.

174
00:11:59.88 --> 00:12:00.88
That's not happening.

175
00:12:00.88 --> 00:12:07.76
You need to start off with cover move teamwork is critical and obviously we just read a

176
00:12:07.76 --> 00:12:13.44
couple of sort of war story-ish type things but like extreme ownership this book's kind

177
00:12:13.44 --> 00:12:15.000
of set up the same way as extreme ownership.

178
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.68
I mean, oh, not kind of it is set up the same way as extreme ownership which is a story

179
00:12:21.68 --> 00:12:29.32
about combat that reveals a principle and then actually state what the principle is and

180
00:12:29.32 --> 00:12:36.56
then we use a business example that shows how this principle applies in civilian life and

181
00:12:36.56 --> 00:12:37.56
usually in the business world.

182
00:12:37.56 --> 00:12:42.24
In fact, always in the business world that's those examples that we use although we could

183
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:48.44
probably do another book that was about how these principles apply to your under nine

184
00:12:48.44 --> 00:12:55.88
year old soccer team or your relationship with your spouse or your relationship with your

185
00:12:55.88 --> 00:13:02.68
teenage daughters to of them or your relationship with your teenage son or one of them

186
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:07.24
or your relationship with your nine year old daughter or your what do you got three

187
00:13:07.24 --> 00:13:09.08
and four and three and a two year old.

188
00:13:09.08 --> 00:13:10.52
Yeah, get some absolutely.

189
00:13:10.52 --> 00:13:13.28
It could absolutely apply to any of those situations.

190
00:13:13.28 --> 00:13:18.68
I think that was that was was amazing about extreme ownership to see how people apply

191
00:13:18.68 --> 00:13:22.96
that in so many aspects of their lives and now I think with the economy leadership it's

192
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:23.96
exactly the same thing.

193
00:13:23.96 --> 00:13:24.96
Yeah.

194
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:28.04
And it applies across all aspects of a professional and personal life.

195
00:13:28.04 --> 00:13:31.64
Well, it was your two because when when you know when I got out of the teams like I

196
00:13:31.64 --> 00:13:36.16
didn't understand I didn't understand the broad application of what we knew.

197
00:13:36.16 --> 00:13:39.40
I didn't I mean when I started working with civilian companies then it's like oh well this

198
00:13:39.40 --> 00:13:42.08
is your problem you don't keep things simple enough or this is your problem you don't

199
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:46.40
have decentralized commands so you're trying to control all the decision make it's but as soon

200
00:13:46.40 --> 00:13:50.32
as we realized and I realized it was like oh it applies to this company what about

201
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:53.88
this company and okay what about this company and you just realize okay and that's when

202
00:13:53.88 --> 00:13:58.52
I started just seeing it everywhere and and I think yeah exactly right the dichotomy

203
00:13:58.52 --> 00:14:05.76
leadership is the same way and it well like I said it's not just a book of war stories

204
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:11.96
the point of the book is to make people better leaders is to give them leadership tools

205
00:14:11.96 --> 00:14:18.56
including me including you like when you write stuff down you understand it better and

206
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:23.12
so you know part of writing these books is like okay how can I capture these lessons

207
00:14:23.12 --> 00:14:28.28
for myself and of course it's nice that other people can grab them then and look through

208
00:14:28.28 --> 00:14:32.96
them but like I said it's not it's not just about war stories but to make people better

209
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:38.92
leaders and I think I think we covered that pretty well in sort of in the intro of the

210
00:14:38.92 --> 00:14:44.32
book and just a couple paragraphs and you should hit that part that we talked about earlier

211
00:14:44.32 --> 00:14:50.96
where it just kind of gives the overall the overall view or the the high level view of the

212
00:14:50.96 --> 00:14:55.92
topic of the book every behavior or characteristic carried out by a leader can be taken

213
00:14:55.92 --> 00:15:01.68
too far leaders can become too extreme and upset the balance required to effectively lead

214
00:15:01.68 --> 00:15:07.68
a team when balance is lost leadership suffers and the teens performance rapidly declines

215
00:15:07.68 --> 00:15:13.04
even the fundamental principles of combat leadership and extreme ownership can get out

216
00:15:13.04 --> 00:15:18.32
of balance a leader can cover and move too much and step on the toes of other leaders

217
00:15:18.32 --> 00:15:22.96
departments or divisions a plan can be too simple and failed to cover likely

218
00:15:22.96 --> 00:15:28.000
the contingencies a team could go too far with prioritizing execute resulting in target

219
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.12
fixation and loss of situational awareness on newly emerging problems and threats even

220
00:15:34.12 --> 00:15:38.84
destabilize command can be taken too far when too much autonomy is given to support

221
00:15:38.84 --> 00:15:43.84
leaders who then don't fully understand strategic goals and how to execute and support

222
00:15:43.84 --> 00:15:49.44
those goals and this idea continues on but just about everything a leader does leaders must

223
00:15:49.44 --> 00:15:53.92
be close with their people but not too close that it becomes a problem they must hold

224
00:15:53.92 --> 00:15:59.28
the line with discipline but they must not become tyrannical a leader can even become too

225
00:15:59.28 --> 00:16:04.40
extreme with extreme ownership when a leader takes so much ownership of everything in his

226
00:16:04.40 --> 00:16:08.40
or her world that members of the team feel there's nothing left for which they can take

227
00:16:08.40 --> 00:16:14.56
ownership when this happens team members will execute only at the boss's specific direction

228
00:16:14.56 --> 00:16:20.000
without any route ownership or buy in themselves resulting in a team far less capable

229
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.76
of overcoming obstacles and accomplish in the mission therefore balance and leadership

230
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:32.08
is crucial to victory you can't say that one enough and you literally can't say that one

231
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:38.88
enough I would think so when you have the same word to many time on times on a page it's

232
00:16:38.88 --> 00:16:43.52
it's not good writing right it's not good use the same word over and over again so

233
00:16:43.52 --> 00:16:47.76
I remember there was times where we would have the word balance like nine times in a paragraph

234
00:16:47.76 --> 00:16:51.76
but there's it's like hey there's no real other way to say what we're trying to say you got

235
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:56.48
a balance these things and it's interesting too as as as you're reading that I'm just thinking

236
00:16:56.48 --> 00:17:01.68
of all the different situations we've been in in the last few years with echelon front

237
00:17:01.68 --> 00:17:07.28
where we've seen every single one of these things you know the person that comes up

238
00:17:07.28 --> 00:17:11.04
hey we want to keep this plan simple and then they don't think of any contingencies or hey

239
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:14.16
I'm just trying to cover and move and that means I'm going to do the job for them and

240
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:17.92
all of a sudden they're making everyone mad because they're stepping on everyone toes I mean

241
00:17:17.92 --> 00:17:22.000
decentralized command we're no one knows what's going on because it's okay I'm our hands off

242
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
leader I'm using decentralized command but boss what in God's name you actually want us to do

243
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.72
so all these things are we've lived we've lived film now and it became really evident

244
00:17:34.72 --> 00:17:38.16
even though we have you know it's the last chapter the last chapter in extreme ownership is the

245
00:17:38.16 --> 00:17:43.44
dichotomy leadership and discipline equals freedom and you know we put it in there because we knew

246
00:17:43.44 --> 00:17:49.52
it was important but now after working with more people over the past few years it's become so obvious

247
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.04
that this is like such a critical the being able to balance balance balance balance I

248
00:17:55.04 --> 00:18:00.48
use that word nine times in every paragraph because that's what you have to do if you're a leader

249
00:18:00.48 --> 00:18:06.000
and and we talk about this too and the opening of in the opening of the book and you know in

250
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.76
the opening of dichotomy leadership we talk about how one of the problems with the book

251
00:18:11.76 --> 00:18:16.64
extreme ownership is the title extreme ownership because it made everyone just want to get

252
00:18:16.64 --> 00:18:21.60
extraordinary with everything I'm going to be super extreme and so that means you know what I'm

253
00:18:21.60 --> 00:18:25.84
going to do but get extreme on our own everything and we that was one of the earliest things that I

254
00:18:25.84 --> 00:18:30.80
started noticing was people that took so much ownership so on the leader I'm in charge and I take

255
00:18:30.80 --> 00:18:35.04
so much ownership of everything that everyone below me in the chain of command there's nothing

256
00:18:35.04 --> 00:18:38.72
left for them to own and and all of a sudden they're just feeling like hey they're just along

257
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:42.24
for the ride and they're just going to do what they're told to do and all their initiatives gone and

258
00:18:42.24 --> 00:18:47.28
they don't they don't even have they don't they don't it's not that they don't believe but they

259
00:18:47.28 --> 00:18:51.28
just think okay well it's going to do it what we're told so it's not their plan and so they're going

260
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:56.16
to do the best their ability but it's not theirs they don't own it so all those things that you

261
00:18:56.16 --> 00:19:01.84
just talked about are our things that we've we've now seen and there are things that I struggle with

262
00:19:01.84 --> 00:19:04.80
you know I think there's there are things that you struggle I think we each of us struggle with them

263
00:19:04.80 --> 00:19:09.28
it's the hardest part about leadership and as we've seen that over and over again that you know

264
00:19:09.28 --> 00:19:15.36
that brief introduction that we gave it in chapter 12 of extreme ownership you know introduce the

265
00:19:15.36 --> 00:19:20.000
concept but this dives so much deeper into those challenges and I think that's what what I

266
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.16
know about this book is it answers the the questions to that that we get most often about

267
00:19:26.16 --> 00:19:31.28
about how to balance that because that's the hardest part and it's so difficult to do and I

268
00:19:31.28 --> 00:19:35.84
remember it our first master there was a question about you know can you take you know can

269
00:19:35.84 --> 00:19:40.16
extreme ownership go too far I actually answer the question well I think if you're properly

270
00:19:40.16 --> 00:19:45.68
understanding what extreme ownership means no but you actually answer that as I was like yes

271
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:50.16
you can take too much ownership and I think that's what people take that is well I've got to do

272
00:19:50.16 --> 00:19:54.40
everything like no you you're responsible for everything that's what extreme ownership means but

273
00:19:54.40 --> 00:19:58.32
certainly you can you can absolutely take too much ownership where no one's doing anything and I

274
00:19:58.32 --> 00:20:03.36
think we explained that pretty well in this book and this this book was written just like

275
00:20:03.36 --> 00:20:08.32
extreme ownership that economy leadership was written to help leaders as a reference manual and

276
00:20:08.32 --> 00:20:13.20
and if it's something that you know if I see pages like we see so many cops of extreme ownership

277
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:16.64
I mean I want to see pages that are underlined that are highlighted they're tab that are

278
00:20:16.64 --> 00:20:21.60
they're utilized by leaders and and if we've done that and this is a manual that helps

279
00:20:22.08 --> 00:20:26.64
leaders lead better and be better people and lead better teams that then this will have

280
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:30.96
a accomplishes mission you know what's cool is is I think it's very similar to the fact that

281
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:36.40
with extreme ownership right with that attitude with that attitude when you get in that mindset

282
00:20:36.40 --> 00:20:42.08
you start seeing it everywhere and you start when someone makes an excuse you recognize

283
00:20:42.08 --> 00:20:47.68
me that you go that's an excuse like echo is giving you a hard time about your your lack of a

284
00:20:47.68 --> 00:20:53.92
haircut and and you know you were you were saying that I was my fault and we're laughing about it right

285
00:20:54.32 --> 00:20:58.80
and and of course I was I was like well you know I should have told you you know there's

286
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:03.20
gonna be a timeline and you need to get haircut before but you know we're joking about it but

287
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:08.24
in the same time that we're joking about it the fact that like you brought that echo that up

288
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:12.88
is a real thing and for us to be sitting here joking about it means that we actually think about it

289
00:21:12.88 --> 00:21:18.96
we actually every time you know you know laves making it a joke and excuse like oh juggling he's

290
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:25.60
it's like we all know and it's it's it's a it's a it's syncs in and it becomes really like for

291
00:21:25.60 --> 00:21:32.80
someone to make an actual excuse becomes really really hard and I think for me that's one thing that

292
00:21:32.80 --> 00:21:38.88
I've benefited over the last few years of seeing other people what you it's it becomes when you're

293
00:21:38.88 --> 00:21:43.68
aware of it when you're aware of it the balance becomes much much easier to see and that's what

294
00:21:43.68 --> 00:21:47.84
I think is gonna be very helpful about this book is people won't know that they're out of balance

295
00:21:47.84 --> 00:21:51.84
that's the biggest problem a big problem is they don't know they're thinking my my guys are

296
00:21:51.84 --> 00:21:55.92
taking any initiative what's wrong with them and it's like well your micro managing them you've

297
00:21:55.92 --> 00:22:00.40
gone too far in that direction you've gone too far in controlling everything that they do they think

298
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:04.32
that that's they think that if you want them to do something that you're gonna tell them to do it

299
00:22:04.32 --> 00:22:08.16
and other than that they're gonna sit there and stand by a wait for orders and it's like no

300
00:22:08.80 --> 00:22:14.08
so and you if you don't understand that you can be out of balance then you won't recognize that

301
00:22:14.08 --> 00:22:19.44
but if you know hey my guys aren't taking in any initiative I wonder what's wrong with them

302
00:22:20.56 --> 00:22:25.76
well actually maybe it's me maybe it's me and maybe I am micro managing them so much

303
00:22:25.76 --> 00:22:31.12
that I've beaten the initiative out of them so what I need to do is back off a little bit and

304
00:22:31.12 --> 00:22:35.44
we'll give them some leeway and give them some ownership of what they're doing and let them

305
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:39.44
make some decisions down there and if if you do that then you start seeing it come back and you

306
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:43.12
start seeing them take initiative and you feel good and that's a you know one of the chapters in

307
00:22:43.12 --> 00:22:48.08
the book is actually that right there where I talk about my first deployment to Iraq where I first

308
00:22:48.08 --> 00:22:54.72
got to Iraq my first time in combat I was just basically wanted to own everything because that was

309
00:22:54.72 --> 00:22:58.16
my last my personal idea I come to take ownership of this and then I realized my guys

310
00:22:58.16 --> 00:23:01.36
I'm not gonna all the you know they're not really taking the initiative I wanted to take

311
00:23:01.36 --> 00:23:07.52
well why is that it's because I'm micro managing them and finally luckily we got over a

312
00:23:07.52 --> 00:23:12.64
wound with operations we had so many operations to conduct and I was like I can't manage all these

313
00:23:12.64 --> 00:23:17.92
I can't oversee everything that's happening and I had to cut the guys loose and as soon as I

314
00:23:17.92 --> 00:23:21.28
caught a loose and said hey you got this and you got that and you got the other thing the guys

315
00:23:21.28 --> 00:23:25.44
just started stepping up and running everything like I knew like like of course they could because

316
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:30.48
they're freaking highly capable guys and they started kicking ass and I realized like oh I don't

317
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:34.88
even barely even need to be here right barely even need to be here whereas in the beginning I

318
00:23:34.88 --> 00:23:39.60
thought oh this is all I'll if I wasn't for me you know and I'm only talking about a period of a

319
00:23:39.60 --> 00:23:44.24
few weeks of me trying to micro manage everything so I think what's gonna be beneficial about this

320
00:23:44.24 --> 00:23:50.88
book is that people will see how they can get out of balance and and they'll also see that that

321
00:23:50.88 --> 00:23:58.48
balance pertains to just about everything and every trait that you have that's positive as a

322
00:23:58.48 --> 00:24:03.76
leader you can overdue and you can turn it into a negative trait if you go too far

323
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:09.52
see you're going to watch out for that you can definitely got to watch out for that it's easy

324
00:24:09.52 --> 00:24:14.08
for us to see you know we always talk about the attachment attachment so important and for us with you

325
00:24:14.08 --> 00:24:17.12
know throughout coming to Ashland front it's worth working with these leaders and working with these

326
00:24:17.12 --> 00:24:23.76
companies you you can see it you know it just it just stands out so obvious that someone is you know

327
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:27.20
they're trying to cover move by helping another department and yet they're stepping on people's

328
00:24:27.20 --> 00:24:31.60
toes and they're pissing people off and you know like why are you you're trying to do my job and make

329
00:24:31.60 --> 00:24:35.92
me look bad and they get there like well I'm trying to cover move just like you don't me

330
00:24:35.92 --> 00:24:40.08
I'm just trying to help you and then you're saying well you have to be careful about that you have to

331
00:24:40.08 --> 00:24:45.52
balance it so once you know it is the absolute most common problem we see all the time and even

332
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:50.16
for you know folks that have read extreme ownership you know three or four you know multiple times

333
00:24:50.16 --> 00:24:54.48
that that are really trying hard to be better leaders they struggle with that and this is

334
00:24:55.20 --> 00:25:00.24
something to help them and help leaders everywhere and you know and we wrote the book too so that

335
00:25:00.24 --> 00:25:06.08
it could be read it's a follow on certainly a sequel you gave me a chance to correct that

336
00:25:06.08 --> 00:25:10.24
yeah why would you say what do you say on the you were talking about jaws to your dog

337
00:25:10.24 --> 00:25:15.52
yeah podcast one fourteen and I said it's not a sequel it's a standalone book but it absolutely

338
00:25:15.52 --> 00:25:20.80
is a sequel I'm a follow on book it expands on the concepts however we did write it so that that it

339
00:25:20.80 --> 00:25:25.20
is a standalone book and you can read you can read you can read if you have if you can read

340
00:25:25.20 --> 00:25:29.52
dichotomy without having red extreme ownership you'll certainly understand it and be able to

341
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:36.96
play yeah but you'd understand the concepts better if you read extreme ownership first no question

342
00:25:36.96 --> 00:25:43.76
and then you jump into dichotomy which yeah like you said can you read it alone sure you can

343
00:25:43.76 --> 00:25:49.20
I guess there's echo we need like some kind of a movie reference here like yeah I'm thinking

344
00:25:49.20 --> 00:25:56.40
term could you see Terminator two yes on its own right but you will you will get more out of it

345
00:25:56.40 --> 00:26:01.04
if you saw Terminator one first yeah correct same with around see look at me just nailing

346
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:06.24
the right year nailing yeah so rambo right first blood part two same deal where you could watch

347
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:11.92
just rambo and be pretty pretty happy about it hold on now my problem with that is we know that

348
00:26:11.92 --> 00:26:19.44
Terminator two is equivalent in quality to Terminator one correct correct correct yeah right

349
00:26:19.44 --> 00:26:27.04
may I think so okay two is awesome except are we saying that we say that Rambo two which I don't

350
00:26:27.04 --> 00:26:31.84
even think I've seen first blood part two yeah I don't is are we saying that's the same level of

351
00:26:31.84 --> 00:26:36.80
quality is Rambo for one you get to be careful there that's what I think we're actually

352
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:43.36
I mean I'm not saying that's really jaws two which jaws one which is a masterpiece right

353
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:49.84
masterpiece jaws jaws one jaws time called jaws one she's called jaws right jaws two

354
00:26:49.84 --> 00:26:56.16
problematic we got issues so what I'm saying is we're more like the Terminator scenario

355
00:26:56.16 --> 00:27:00.96
got you or aliens I was gonna say aliens is an aliens right you can totally watch that movie

356
00:27:00.96 --> 00:27:04.96
stand alone but obviously gives you some more context if you watch the first one but I think the

357
00:27:04.96 --> 00:27:09.76
second one's actually better yeah then the first one do you feel like do you feel like dichotomies better

358
00:27:09.76 --> 00:27:16.16
I actually do I actually do feel I feel it's better I mean I'm interested to hear what readers think

359
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:23.52
about it but I I think that it's more useful and applicable to to leaders I mean we have three

360
00:27:23.52 --> 00:27:31.12
years additional leadership experience and not only evaluating our experiences in combat and in

361
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:37.60
the seal teens but but now working with hundreds of leaders and I mean really we're talking

362
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:42.000
in you know a couple a hundred plus companies that we've worked with in that time

363
00:27:43.12 --> 00:27:46.64
easily you know between just you mean you probably not that's not even counting some of the other

364
00:27:46.64 --> 00:27:52.96
members of our team so we've seen this in in a whole lot of different scenarios and I think

365
00:27:52.96 --> 00:27:58.56
it really addresses the it's a direct application to the problems that we see so I'm pretty all

366
00:27:58.56 --> 00:28:02.64
for one I'm looking forward to to readers feedback on was it easier for you to write

367
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:10.96
yes yeah I mean for me it definitely was and I say easier just because we we well we became

368
00:28:10.96 --> 00:28:17.04
better writers as we wrote extreme ownership extreme ownership the first version that we did

369
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:23.60
extreme ownership was in the third person and I forget why we even did that but we was about

370
00:28:23.60 --> 00:28:29.68
these two guys named life in jacco it was about I think I kind of forget I think it was a recommendation

371
00:28:29.68 --> 00:28:34.32
that came to us from the literature the publisher whatever and we know then we finally had to say

372
00:28:34.32 --> 00:28:38.88
yeah we're not doing that yeah you know that friend of yours that talks about themselves

373
00:28:38.88 --> 00:28:44.08
in the third person that you make fun of yeah we're not going to do that yeah so and it's weird

374
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:49.20
because there's the book there's there's a couple books I've done in the podcast clay pages

375
00:28:49.20 --> 00:28:54.40
is the St. Lowe by Glover Johns who's the guy for that you know hack worth wrote about

376
00:28:54.40 --> 00:28:59.76
he wrote the book clay pages that clay pages as they say Lowe and it's in the third person

377
00:28:59.76 --> 00:29:05.36
about a guy named major johns and it's him and he writes a thing in the beginning and says hey

378
00:29:05.36 --> 00:29:09.28
I didn't feel comfortable talking about myself so I did a wrote it this way it's like okay

379
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:13.36
and the the only thing I would say that's cool about it you could you could kind of give an outside

380
00:29:13.36 --> 00:29:18.64
view but the thing that's not cool about it is you couldn't be I was thinking this right now which is

381
00:29:18.64 --> 00:29:23.76
kind of what I want to hear and that's why I normally cover books that are first person

382
00:29:23.76 --> 00:29:28.08
people that actually experience it but he's a guy that did a couple other people I've

383
00:29:28.08 --> 00:29:33.44
when you're when you're Glover Johns though and you're your David Hackworth CDADD you can

384
00:29:33.44 --> 00:29:39.52
know you can do whatever you want to do it you want for sure now that's another part that's

385
00:29:40.24 --> 00:29:48.24
again you know we've we've in this book we set it up the same way with combat story principle

386
00:29:48.24 --> 00:29:55.76
followed by a business example but one thing that I think and this is feedback that that we both

387
00:29:55.76 --> 00:30:02.40
got that I certainly got was that for what for because the consequences are so high in combat it

388
00:30:02.40 --> 00:30:09.12
makes the principle very clear and even though people might know well I've never been in combat

389
00:30:09.12 --> 00:30:14.96
but they understand that if we're not working together as a team doing cover move we will die

390
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:20.08
and so when they understand that they go okay now that means if I'm not working with the other

391
00:30:20.08 --> 00:30:24.16
department then we're gonna lose money or we're not gonna complete our mission or we're not

392
00:30:24.16 --> 00:30:30.72
gonna take market share yes so I think one of the strongest points of of extreme ownership that we

393
00:30:30.72 --> 00:30:39.12
did again is the combat stories to to sort of introduce the principles and plus it's cool to hear cool

394
00:30:39.12 --> 00:30:45.68
stories like that but one of them I think chapter three another another one that we pulled out

395
00:30:45.68 --> 00:30:50.72
that said it'd be good to sort of cover this one real quick is you opened up chapter three

396
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:57.12
with a little a little bit of get some I guess we could say and get that one man I want to I want

397
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:03.68
to hear that one I want to hear the Texas Batman get crazy in in Ramadi in 2006 this is bringing

398
00:31:03.68 --> 00:31:10.48
back some awesome memories here bright orange tracer streaked like laser beams just a few feet

399
00:31:10.48 --> 00:31:16.88
over our heads each supersonic bullet zipping past with a thunderous crack holy shit I thought

400
00:31:16.88 --> 00:31:22.24
as we quickly duck down behind the roof wall those are friendly shooting at us I looked over at Dave

401
00:31:22.24 --> 00:31:27.92
Burke who crouched down nearby like the other seals on the roof with us we tried to stay low enough

402
00:31:27.92 --> 00:31:32.88
not to get our head shot off Dave looked back at me and shook his head with a smile mixed humor

403
00:31:32.88 --> 00:31:38.48
and concern that's not cool they've said the understatement of the year Dave Burke was a

404
00:31:38.48 --> 00:31:43.84
US Marine Corps major a fighter pilot by trade he had been the lead instructor at the legendary

405
00:31:43.84 --> 00:31:49.44
US Navy fighter weapon school better known as top gun Dave had left the cockpit behind a volunteer

406
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:54.80
to serve on the ground as a forward air controller in the most dangerous place in Iraq Ramadi

407
00:31:55.36 --> 00:32:00.88
he led a supporting arms liaison team or salt attached to the US Marine Corps fifth air

408
00:32:00.88 --> 00:32:06.40
naval gun fire liaison company Dave and his twelve Marines from salt six a company Charlie

409
00:32:06.40 --> 00:32:11.84
Batoon to coordinate with the aircraft supporting this operation in the skies overhead they patrolled

410
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:18.24
him with us on foot to spearhead the operation ahead of the US Army and Iraqi Army units a US tank

411
00:32:18.24 --> 00:32:24.32
200 yards away had fired a burst from its heavy machine gun directly over our position it was

412
00:32:24.32 --> 00:32:31.04
friendly fire a blue on blue in US military parlance to be killed or horribly wounded by enemy fire

413
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:37.92
was one thing to be killed by our own american forces was something much worse that was way too close

414
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:42.64
for comfort I thought in the seconds following as a crouches lowest possible behind the low

415
00:32:42.64 --> 00:32:48.80
concrete wall that was our only means of cover we had to shut that down immediately and alert the tank

416
00:32:48.80 --> 00:32:56.000
that we were friendly forces to do so I had to contact the specific tank commander directly via radio

417
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.40
and tell them to cease fire the tanks heavy machine gun was a 50 caliber M2 Browning

418
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:09.20
known as the Maadouce it packed a hell of a punch and US military service since 1933 it

419
00:33:09.20 --> 00:33:14.72
improvement its deadly effectiveness in every american war since World War I each massive

420
00:33:14.72 --> 00:33:20.000
round could take a man's head clean off or remove the bulk of his chest cavity it could also

421
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.28
punch right through concrete walls like the one we were hiding behind we had just received a fully

422
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:30.48
automatic burst of probably a dozen rounds in a matter of seconds if I didn't shut down the fire

423
00:33:30.48 --> 00:33:35.92
immediately and let the US tank know we were friendly it could mean horrible wounds in death for a

424
00:33:35.92 --> 00:33:44.32
number of us blue on blue it's even an extreme ownership we talked there's three episodes of blue on

425
00:33:44.32 --> 00:33:51.68
blue potential or blue the app with with Chris potentially shooting the american trooper that was in a

426
00:33:51.68 --> 00:33:59.84
in a building the Bradley getting ready to light up stoneers guys and also the blue on blue

427
00:33:59.84 --> 00:34:06.88
that the book starts off with there's it's interesting and a reality of war that we talk about

428
00:34:06.88 --> 00:34:14.40
blue on blue a lot in that urban environment the other thing I noticed is did I don't mean to

429
00:34:14.40 --> 00:34:21.12
accuse you here like you know on this in this format but each massive round could take a man's head

430
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:26.24
clean off is that not just jacked from clean eastwood right there come on man that's 44

431
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:33.04
magnum that's dirty hairy right I can either confirm to that you look at you there's uh

432
00:34:33.04 --> 00:34:39.68
that did you consult with echo for you know party writing here and the echo echo and I we see

433
00:34:39.68 --> 00:34:44.08
out of the movie quotes there was a little there was a use of parlance in there too that

434
00:34:44.08 --> 00:34:49.52
uh in the parlance in the parlance on our times you threw a little little big libowski in there

435
00:34:50.08 --> 00:34:54.40
that we had previously looked out that was a crazy situation and we were I thought we'd done

436
00:34:54.40 --> 00:34:59.36
everything what was so crazy about that situation for us is I thought we'd done everything in our

437
00:34:59.36 --> 00:35:04.96
power to mitigate the risk of that and let everybody know where we were a marked our position you know

438
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:11.44
talking coordinate with people and and to still get shot at by friendlies you know they uh

439
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:16.64
that was that was crazy David I was looking at you like man this this is good this isn't good at all

440
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:21.60
so it was it was a I was a foam of that radio trying to get and and talk to them immediately

441
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:27.68
and thank God as we talked about on previous podcasts you'd come down on us to be able to use

442
00:35:28.80 --> 00:35:32.24
to be able to learn how to use those radios ourselves and not just rely on the radio and

443
00:35:32.64 --> 00:35:37.84
and I was able to swap over and and make direct cops that take and and get them to cease fire

444
00:35:38.40 --> 00:35:42.56
and that's one of the things that I like completely held the line on and and you know and you

445
00:35:42.56 --> 00:35:47.12
talk about in the book how there's some other things where I allowed a little bit of slack and you actually

446
00:35:47.12 --> 00:35:55.52
you actually kind of capture that in a couple pages later that I pulled up here it's a middle of page

447
00:35:55.52 --> 00:36:03.28
76 punch through that little section right there and I think it's a it's a good good kind of

448
00:36:03.28 --> 00:36:07.92
captures what we're talking about in terms of and you were saying this to me early earlier today you're like

449
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:13.36
everyone thinks jocca would just be like okay you're gonna shut up do what I tell you to do and it's like

450
00:36:13.36 --> 00:36:18.72
well actually there's some things I'm gonna tell you that but there's something it's gonna

451
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:24.48
there's gonna be a balance well you actually you never said you shut up and do do us do what I tell you to do

452
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:30.48
right I'm sure you probably wanted to but many many times yeah and still do I'm I'm sure

453
00:36:30.48 --> 00:36:36.64
often but there is it's not effective it's never effective to do that and I think so many leaders

454
00:36:36.64 --> 00:36:40.08
that want to just you know why won't they just do what I tell them to do it's it's people get really

455
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:44.48
frustrated by that but obviously there you got to hold a line you absolutely have to hold a line you know

456
00:36:44.48 --> 00:36:48.56
and if you'd have a linen on us being able to learn how to use a radio I mean that could have

457
00:36:48.56 --> 00:36:53.36
cost lives right there another verse around comes to the roof wall are we take a main gun

458
00:36:53.36 --> 00:36:58.80
round now you're talking the the cannon on the tank the 120 millimeter main gun round you know

459
00:36:58.80 --> 00:37:03.12
just smash through both sides of walls you know it would it would have been absolute catastrophic

460
00:37:03.12 --> 00:37:06.48
those guys think you know they're under attack they're shooting back at what they think is

461
00:37:06.48 --> 00:37:11.68
enemy that didn't realize it and it's not like they were they were not ready to use those main

462
00:37:11.68 --> 00:37:16.16
gun rounds if they had to they were they were putting some buildings down over there for sure

463
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:19.60
and that's and that's the hard part right is that you've got to hold a line and there's standards

464
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:24.32
that can't be compromised and you've got to you're failing your team and your fan is a leader if you're

465
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:31.04
not keeping those standards uh high and making sure the team achieves them and yet also you can't

466
00:37:31.04 --> 00:37:36.000
be the unrelenting task master the slave driver that just smash his people down is this

467
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.20
shut up and do it a take yeah this is something that I bring up a lot when I'm working with companies

468
00:37:39.20 --> 00:37:47.12
is like do you actually want people to do it to do whatever you don't do and the the immediate

469
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:50.64
answers like well yeah I just want everyone to shut up and do what I tell them to do well the

470
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:56.56
actual answer is no you don't want that if you're a good leader what you want is if I tell

471
00:37:56.56 --> 00:38:03.28
life hey go take that building over there and you say to me no and I say why not you say well

472
00:38:03.28 --> 00:38:08.000
there's an idea in the front yard and we'll all get killed if we go there I'm going okay thank you

473
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.40
now as opposed to you you're you're just going to blindly do whatever I tell you to do well then

474
00:38:12.40 --> 00:38:17.20
that's going to be problematic so there's a balance in this too and and that's something that we

475
00:38:17.20 --> 00:38:20.88
talk about all the time but to surround you don't want to surround yourself with the S-men you

476
00:38:20.88 --> 00:38:26.48
don't want to surround yourself with the S-men and we I've seen plenty of companies where the

477
00:38:26.48 --> 00:38:31.76
boss man has surrounded himself with the S-men and they yes themselves into the grave because

478
00:38:31.76 --> 00:38:35.76
there the everyone's just a green oh yep we'll do that that sounds like a great plan boss oh yeah

479
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:40.32
yes boss that sounds like a great plan boss and and the next thing you know someone along the

480
00:38:40.32 --> 00:38:45.36
line should have said hey boss that doesn't make any sense hey boss like oh we got a good

481
00:38:45.36 --> 00:38:49.68
relationship with these people over here but you know what they're raising their price a little bit

482
00:38:49.68 --> 00:38:55.76
we don't want to work with them anymore okay well let's think about that you know that that that's

483
00:38:55.76 --> 00:39:00.48
one of our biggest suppliers do we really want to mix our relationship with our biggest supplier

484
00:39:00.48 --> 00:39:04.000
does that make sense well you know they're getting in our face now a yes man will be like that's

485
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.88
right boss we don't take no crap from no one who's through those guys but maybe you want someone

486
00:39:08.88 --> 00:39:13.36
below you in the chain of commences hey boss let's think about this that's our biggest supplier

487
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:18.56
if we cut them off and demand goes up we won't be able to service our customers that could be

488
00:39:18.56 --> 00:39:24.32
problematic wouldn't you agree how but we negotiate with them so there's my point is you don't just

489
00:39:24.32 --> 00:39:28.24
want people you don't want to be surrounded by yes man you want people are going to question

490
00:39:28.24 --> 00:39:32.16
you you want people are going to be that's why like you so much life because you you question

491
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:37.12
you you have no problem question you would have said it's all good push you back yeah the

492
00:39:37.12 --> 00:39:45.76
humble not passive but I I've never never been passive but I think this this here page 76 that's a

493
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:51.60
good that's a good little wait a capture what we're talking about as our reflected upon joccos

494
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:56.24
demonstration of a leader's responsibility to ensure standards are maintained I thought about

495
00:39:56.24 --> 00:40:00.56
the times of my career when I failed to do so as a young leader I knew there were times we

496
00:40:00.56 --> 00:40:05.36
needed to improve our performance do another run to the kill house where we practice close quarters

497
00:40:05.36 --> 00:40:11.20
combat or add an additional rehearsal to ensure we were fully prepared yet in those moments

498
00:40:11.20 --> 00:40:16.24
I sometimes hadn't held the line I hadn't pushed the team hard enough any additional work

499
00:40:16.24 --> 00:40:20.40
assigned to the team was going to get pushback and generate complaints and there were times

500
00:40:20.40 --> 00:40:26.000
when I let things slide confusing the idea of taking care of your people with allowing them not

501
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.88
to work as hard but in the end that resulted in mediocre performance and the team never got better

502
00:40:32.88 --> 00:40:38.64
never held each other accountable this was a failure of leadership my leadership I also

503
00:40:38.64 --> 00:40:43.92
recognized the dichotomy there were other times when I was overbearing I insisted on doing things

504
00:40:43.92 --> 00:40:49.12
a certain way because it was my way or harped on trivial matters that were strategically

505
00:40:49.12 --> 00:40:55.20
unimportant thinking I was doing right by holding the line it caused unnecessary friction

506
00:40:55.20 --> 00:41:01.44
stifled growth and inhibited junior leaders on the team from stepping up it prevented us from functioning

507
00:41:01.44 --> 00:41:06.96
properly with effective decentralized command I had seen and worked for numerous leaders throughout my

508
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:12.32
navy career who had been overbearing and it wasn't the way I wanted to lead some of them imposed

509
00:41:12.32 --> 00:41:18.08
harsh discipline screened at their people and crushed them morale of the team no one wanted to follow

510
00:41:18.08 --> 00:41:24.000
them they might accomplish an immediate task but in the long run the team's growth was smothered

511
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.68
often their negative example stood starkly in my mind I never want to be a leader like that

512
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:38.40
there you go the tyrannical leader that's run around screaming at everyone and and like you just

513
00:41:38.40 --> 00:41:43.84
said they'll get some little tasks accomplished and they actually think that what's horrible is

514
00:41:43.84 --> 00:41:48.96
they get some little task accomplished because they screamed in yelled and it reinforces that behavior

515
00:41:48.96 --> 00:41:53.44
and so they become even more tyrannical and yell and scream even more and they never see the fact

516
00:41:53.44 --> 00:41:58.64
that acting that way it'll get you a little short term thing done but you'll never get everything

517
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:02.72
you can out of people you never get everything you can out of somebody that you've beaten in

518
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:07.36
this mission you're they're not going to perform to their fullest potential and capability and

519
00:42:07.36 --> 00:42:11.20
that's just where you're going to be that's just where you're going to be the other thing

520
00:42:13.20 --> 00:42:20.40
it takes this is this is one of those things like if you've got something that's hard to do right

521
00:42:20.40 --> 00:42:26.32
you've got something that the team has gone to do that's hard to do and you're wishy-washy about it

522
00:42:26.32 --> 00:42:30.80
you know it's the right thing to do but you're wishy-washy about how you approach the team with doing it

523
00:42:32.72 --> 00:42:36.08
it's not going to happen it's just not going to happen I'm reading another book right now

524
00:42:36.08 --> 00:42:42.000
by a guy that was in Vietnam with Hacworth and he's saying just he would just lay down the

525
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.36
law like Hacworth is like no we're doing this this is what we're going to do this is how it's going to be

526
00:42:45.36 --> 00:42:53.44
and that's that's what it is you know I've got so many examples from my career but I'll tell you

527
00:42:53.44 --> 00:43:00.48
really kind of a lame one but it's it's worth telling so back good noon dude guess what we used to

528
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:04.80
do in the teams we used to drink beer a lot of it and that was kind of like hey you know we're

529
00:43:04.80 --> 00:43:11.36
we're in the steels you know we're beer drink and frog men and that's cool and I was in a

530
00:43:11.36 --> 00:43:18.08
seal platoon where we drink a lot even more than a normal seal platoon which is what you

531
00:43:18.08 --> 00:43:23.04
know what you put you in the running for a lot and this is back in the 90s there's no

532
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:28.56
we're going on and I've said this before kind of the way that we proved ourselves because there's

533
00:43:28.56 --> 00:43:32.32
a certain level of sacrifice you have to make to prove to your teammates that you're like you're

534
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:36.80
willing to sacrifice well one of the ways that you can sacrifice is you can just drink a lot

535
00:43:36.80 --> 00:43:41.76
and prove that you can go all night go hard and still get up the next day and so I was in a

536
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:47.44
seal platoon where we drank a lot just about everyone in the chain of command except for the the

537
00:43:47.44 --> 00:43:53.20
commander the OIC but everyone else you know we drank hard and you know we we've partied in whatever

538
00:43:54.40 --> 00:44:00.08
and we were a ship board we were an argue platoon so we were deploying on board a ship

539
00:44:00.08 --> 00:44:08.16
and when we were getting ready to deploy on the ship it was kind of like oh well you know we'll

540
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:11.52
just because you're not allowed to drink any alcohol on the ship you're not allowed to have

541
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:16.000
any alcohol you're not allowed drinking alcohol you after 90 days it's see you can get a beer day

542
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.40
they give 45 or 45 or back when I was in the sea get you get one beer 45 days so they gave us

543
00:44:24.40 --> 00:44:30.40
it two beers but I will say they gave us fosters so they were big oil cans right but you're

544
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:36.32
living large yeah I did two two beer days in one deployment anyways you're not allowed other

545
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:42.000
than that you're not allowed to drink that's the rules and so I think it wasn't like we openly

546
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.32
discussed like how we gonna smuggle beer or maybe we did a little bit but our bosses came down

547
00:44:46.32 --> 00:44:51.36
to like yeah well there's no drinking on no drinking on the ship and we were like okay those

548
00:44:51.36 --> 00:44:56.08
little they just came down and put the rules down like hey no drinking on the ship and I had

549
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:02.88
respect for my off my platoon commander at the time had respect for my platoon chief at the time

550
00:45:03.60 --> 00:45:08.08
and they came down and said yeah well there's no drinking on ship so don't even think about it

551
00:45:08.08 --> 00:45:11.92
we're like okay cool that's the lock came down and we just got on board we just got on board with it

552
00:45:12.80 --> 00:45:19.44
whereas if it would have been well you know a little bit of wishy washing us us young E3's E4's

553
00:45:19.44 --> 00:45:24.32
and E5's if they would have been remotely wishy washing we didn't like oh cool you guys go drink

554
00:45:24.32 --> 00:45:28.08
whatever you want just don't let us see it or whatever and that would have been bad because eventually

555
00:45:28.08 --> 00:45:33.60
guess what you put a bunch of seals on a ship with with booze and you leave them on there for

556
00:45:33.60 --> 00:45:37.84
multiple days it's see months it's see well they're gonna have an incident of some kind they're

557
00:45:37.84 --> 00:45:41.52
gonna get a fight they're gonna throw up somewhere they're gonna you know some just dumb stuff

558
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:47.52
it's gonna get to the highest level of attention it's gonna be a total disaster so the idea of

559
00:45:47.52 --> 00:45:51.68
actually just stepping up and holding the line and I'll tell you what I learned as a leader

560
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:58.40
is it's liberating to do that it's liberating to say hey look here's the rules and and you know

561
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:02.80
I did this with the fact of when we got back to our body we got to our body and they told us

562
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:06.64
we had to work with Iraqi soldiers and everyone was kind of him and it honed about having to work with Iraqi

563
00:46:06.64 --> 00:46:12.72
soldiers and I told you guys don't even submit a concept of operations without Iraqi soldiers don't even

564
00:46:12.72 --> 00:46:19.12
submit it because we're not doing it and you guys were like okay got it yeah it is super liberating

565
00:46:19.12 --> 00:46:24.24
I think that's the you know one of the things that that I you know that I learned from you as we

566
00:46:24.24 --> 00:46:29.28
started working together I mean and I talked to be about this all the time I talked about on the podcast

567
00:46:29.28 --> 00:46:34.48
before but it was the kind of things that you know you probably should be doing but for whatever

568
00:46:34.48 --> 00:46:38.88
reason you are and and you know for you could just put it perspective for me like it's very black and

569
00:46:38.88 --> 00:46:42.80
why not like no if you're not if you're not holding the line on these things that are important

570
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:46.08
and pushing your team to perform with the highest standard or make it sure they're not going to do

571
00:46:46.08 --> 00:46:50.72
something it's going to get them in trouble or cause massive issues not only for us but for the entire

572
00:46:50.72 --> 00:46:55.60
you know not on for our unit but the entire seal teams then then that's you're failing them as a

573
00:46:55.60 --> 00:47:00.32
leader you you've got to hold the line on that stuff you've got to and and it is very liberating

574
00:47:00.32 --> 00:47:05.44
to say oh check okay that's the way it is and I think that ambiguity is very frustrating for people

575
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:08.56
but they don't know what's right you don't know what's wrong they can get away with stuff

576
00:47:08.56 --> 00:47:12.40
yeah that's what I was going to say but the people below you and the chain of command they

577
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:16.24
get frustrated because they're like what was that mean and they're going to push it to the envelope

578
00:47:16.24 --> 00:47:20.32
but they just got got away with it over here but that guy didn't you know I mean that's yeah those are

579
00:47:20.32 --> 00:47:24.000
the kind of things where there needs to there's got to be a standard you got to hold that standard and

580
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
it's I it the team is so much better off when you do that and certainly bruiser absolutely was

581
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.20
and and this is one of those things where then people think well juggle always holds the line and

582
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.08
there would be no slack whatsoever right no fucking slack right that's how we roll and it's like

583
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:47.68
hmm actually there is slack and there's times where you give slack I mean I mean I always talk about

584
00:47:47.68 --> 00:47:52.24
and we always talk about how I was super strict about uniforms right like hey we're going to

585
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:55.92
wear uniforms no patches all this stuff right we talk about that stuff all the time but when someone

586
00:47:55.92 --> 00:48:01.20
wasn't when we when we were when we were in our camp I didn't care what you wore if you were

587
00:48:01.20 --> 00:48:06.16
going to be interacting with the army of the Marine Corps I didn't care what you wore at all I mean

588
00:48:06.16 --> 00:48:10.24
I barely put on a shirt when we were on bed right I mean I'd be sitting in the tactical operations

589
00:48:10.24 --> 00:48:16.96
that are let me flip flops yeah flip flops and that's it yeah it brown t-shirt and sometimes yeah

590
00:48:16.96 --> 00:48:22.64
sometimes and and so I didn't I'm not holding line I'm not getting crazy because guess what that's

591
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.96
not important if I would have been running around policing up people's uniforms inside of our camp

592
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:36.96
which was just us man I would have wasted a bunch of leadership capital and frustrated everyone

593
00:48:36.96 --> 00:48:44.16
and then guess what when I tell them hey you got to learn how to program your radio that is that is

594
00:48:44.16 --> 00:48:49.04
explained with the same importance as hey you got to blouse your boots when you're inside our camp

595
00:48:49.04 --> 00:48:54.48
that's the wrong message to send so that's why this that's why I wrote this book because this is

596
00:48:54.48 --> 00:48:58.64
about balance you've got to be able to balance when to hold the line what's important what's

597
00:48:58.64 --> 00:49:03.28
worth holding line for and what things do you go okay you know what you know what lathe you

598
00:49:03.28 --> 00:49:07.92
guys want to do it that way that's cool go do it and that's what you need to learn that balance

599
00:49:08.72 --> 00:49:17.36
that balance is hard it's hard to do I think that again I think the awareness of it I think the

600
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:24.80
awareness of it and I don't really know when I recognize the awareness of it I mean I know

601
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:30.96
like when when Flynn Flynn puts up the slides of like the juggle breathe from back in the day

602
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:35.92
I talked about the dichotomy leadership back then I'm surprised I even knew what dichotomy meant

603
00:49:37.12 --> 00:49:41.68
I literally forgot what I'm looking for the brief I looked at I remember what I'm talking about

604
00:49:41.68 --> 00:49:47.36
but it's one of those things I recognized it I saw it and I could definitely see it but

605
00:49:48.40 --> 00:49:52.56
now and just the more we work with companies even when I was in the teams the more I was working with

606
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:58.24
the see-up tune you'd see when a guy was like here's a good example you know when a guy talks too much

607
00:49:58.24 --> 00:50:02.40
when you have a leader that just talks all the time just doesn't stop he always has something

608
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:07.84
else he he won't let anyone else get the last word it's always that guy's people stop listening to

609
00:50:07.84 --> 00:50:12.32
him because he's talking all the time and it's like hey I got a good idea well why don't you be

610
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:18.56
quiet for a little while and I hated to have to tell that to somebody because they get super self-conscious

611
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:22.48
but you know I'm usually phrased it a different way like hey you should you should let your

612
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:26.40
guys run a little bit you know let them let them get the last word and let it's going to give

613
00:50:26.40 --> 00:50:30.24
them more ownership of what you're doing if when they get done saying and that's how we're going

614
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:35.28
to do it tonight and then this guy chimes in and you know what when we do it that way and you're

615
00:50:35.28 --> 00:50:41.36
like oh you don't need to say it again you think you don't need to double tap guys would say this

616
00:50:41.36 --> 00:50:46.80
debriefing I'm going to double tap that but that's already been tapped don't double tap it

617
00:50:46.80 --> 00:50:50.72
we're going to triple tap this thing we used to have a symbol if you can't see this here listen

618
00:50:50.72 --> 00:50:56.08
we put our two whatever two pea signs and touch your thumbs together and it's like four legs

619
00:50:56.08 --> 00:51:00.56
sticking up in the air that's a dead horse that's the symbol for dead horse bro you don't need to

620
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:06.72
say this again it's dead horse quit beating it to death wait what is double what is tap double tap

621
00:51:06.72 --> 00:51:10.72
double tap well when you shoot a target you shoot it once and then what you normally do is you shoot

622
00:51:10.72 --> 00:51:15.76
a twice boom boom and so it's called a double tap so go back a fast mobile so if I was

623
00:51:15.76 --> 00:51:22.72
doing briefing you and and I was like echo you know you need to keep your shop groups a little bit

624
00:51:22.72 --> 00:51:28.32
tighter on the next run cool you got it and I said well the double tap on that you know you really

625
00:51:28.32 --> 00:51:31.36
need to work on the shop yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

626
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:36.32
I'm saying the same thing kind of like I second that notion it kind of thing it is but if you said that

627
00:51:36.32 --> 00:51:43.12
if you said I second that you could leave it there right but if you said I second that because you

628
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:47.36
really need to tighten up your groups because your groups are a little bit dispersed around the

629
00:51:47.36 --> 00:51:50.16
target area and that's going to be bad we all know it's bad bro we all know it's bad bro

630
00:51:50.16 --> 00:51:57.68
you know we all know it's thing thing office space TPS report yeah I understand clear now and

631
00:51:58.72 --> 00:52:05.76
now all that being said so it's cool I think again having the combat stories let some of these things

632
00:52:05.76 --> 00:52:10.32
sign and that's a good example right there you're talking first person what you're actually thinking

633
00:52:10.32 --> 00:52:19.04
which I think is powerful but it's good also to to outline the principles and that's what we did

634
00:52:19.04 --> 00:52:23.92
so here's one of the principles we outlined and this is an important one because

635
00:52:25.12 --> 00:52:29.04
man we got because we talk about being aggressive as a matter of fact we have T shirts it's a

636
00:52:29.04 --> 00:52:33.60
default aggressive right like we're not playing around being aggressive and what does that mean

637
00:52:33.60 --> 00:52:40.000
that means that we get some people in the in the military and in the civilian sector that we say

638
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.88
D default mode aggressive they go default mode aggressive and they don't know when to stop they get

639
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:49.68
reckless they get careless they go too hard and so going back to the book here

640
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:58.000
problems aren't going to solve themselves a leader must get aggressive and take action to solve

641
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:04.16
the problems and implement a solution being too passive and waiting for a solution to appear

642
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:09.76
often enables the problem to escalate and get out of control the enemy isn't going to back off

643
00:53:09.76 --> 00:53:18.24
the leader must get aggressive and put the enemy in check the good deal isn't going to deliver

644
00:53:18.24 --> 00:53:25.44
itself to a company the leader has to go out and make a good deal happen changes and new

645
00:53:25.44 --> 00:53:31.44
methodologies in a team are going to implement themselves leaders need to aggressively implement them

646
00:53:32.08 --> 00:53:37.44
and aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader default aggressive

647
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:45.28
this means that the best leaders the best teams don't wait to act instead understanding the

648
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:50.96
strategic vision or commanders intent they aggressively execute to overcome obstacles

649
00:53:50.96 --> 00:53:57.44
capitalize on immediate opportunities accomplish the mission and win rather than

650
00:53:57.44 --> 00:54:03.28
passively waiting to be told what to do default aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways

651
00:54:03.28 --> 00:54:08.32
to further the strategic mission they understand the commanders intent and where they have authority

652
00:54:08.32 --> 00:54:14.96
to do so they execute for decisions that are beyond their pay grade or above their authority

653
00:54:14.96 --> 00:54:19.76
default aggressive leaders still make a recommendation of the chain of command to solve

654
00:54:19.76 --> 00:54:26.48
problems and execute key tasks to achieve strategic victory in seal platoons and task units

655
00:54:26.48 --> 00:54:32.40
we expect this from leaders at every level right down to the front line trooper in charge of just

656
00:54:32.40 --> 00:54:39.68
himself and his small piece of the mission but this mentality is crucial to any leader in any

657
00:54:39.68 --> 00:54:48.16
team or organization it is just as critical to success in business as on the battlefield

658
00:54:48.72 --> 00:54:57.60
aggressive means proactive but it doesn't mean that leaders can get angry lose their temper or be

659
00:54:57.60 --> 00:55:04.72
aggressive toward their people a leader must always deal professionally with subordinates on the team

660
00:55:04.72 --> 00:55:09.92
peers leaders up the chain of command customers or clients and personnel and supporting roles

661
00:55:09.92 --> 00:55:17.52
outside the immediate team speaking angrily to others is ineffective losing your temper is a sign

662
00:55:17.52 --> 00:55:24.56
of weakness the aggression that wins on the battlefield in business or in life is directed not

663
00:55:24.56 --> 00:55:32.48
toward people but toward solving problems achieving goals and accomplishing the mission it is also

664
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:39.20
critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to make sure that risks have been

665
00:55:39.20 --> 00:55:47.44
assessed and mitigated the dichotomy with the default aggressive mindset is that sometimes

666
00:55:47.44 --> 00:55:56.72
hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so that he or she can react properly to it

667
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:02.88
rather than immediately respond to enemy fire sometimes the prudent decision is to wait and see how

668
00:56:02.88 --> 00:56:10.48
it develops is it a simple reconnaissance by fire is it a faint by the enemy meant to distract from the

669
00:56:10.48 --> 00:56:15.92
real attack is the enemy simply trying to lure you into a confined area where they have a

670
00:56:15.92 --> 00:56:23.20
superior force waiting to ambush a careful moment of consideration might reveal the enemies true

671
00:56:23.20 --> 00:56:30.64
intentions to be overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless that can lead the

672
00:56:30.64 --> 00:56:37.44
team into a disaster and put the greater mission in peril to disregard prudent counsel when someone

673
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:44.80
with experience urges caution to dismiss significant threats or to fail to plan for likely contingencies

674
00:56:44.80 --> 00:56:53.68
is foolhardy it is bad leadership a chief contributing factor to recklessness comes from what military

675
00:56:53.68 --> 00:57:00.88
historians have long referred to as the disease of victory this disease takes place when a few

676
00:57:00.88 --> 00:57:07.28
battlefield successes producing overconfidence in a team's own tactical prowess while underestimating

677
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:14.16
the capabilities of its enemy or competitor this is a problem not just for combat leaders but for

678
00:57:14.16 --> 00:57:21.20
leaders and teams anywhere in any arena throughout the business world and the civilian sector it is

679
00:57:21.20 --> 00:57:29.36
a leaders duty to fight against this disease so that the team despite its success never gets complacent

680
00:57:30.56 --> 00:57:37.12
the risking any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards of mission success

681
00:57:37.12 --> 00:57:46.16
and of course to counter that thought the cost of inaction must be weighed as well as aggressive

682
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:53.28
as leaders must be leaders must be cautious that they are not running to their deaths simply because

683
00:57:53.28 --> 00:58:01.28
it is their instinct to take action that I caught a me between aggression and caution must be balanced

684
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:12.24
so be aggressive but never reckless so there's a principle principle laid out and then of

685
00:58:12.24 --> 00:58:19.12
course it's followed up with a business example of which there are manifold of businesses where

686
00:58:19.76 --> 00:58:25.76
the business gets too aggressive they start getting properties to put more stores into and they build

687
00:58:25.76 --> 00:58:29.44
up all this rent that they got to pay every month the next thing you know they have a down

688
00:58:29.44 --> 00:58:33.92
month and they got real estate bills to pay or they start hiring a ton of people because they

689
00:58:33.92 --> 00:58:37.84
get a super aggressive and that's you know kind of where this story leads to is we're bringing

690
00:58:37.84 --> 00:58:40.96
going to bring in all these people because we think this future success is coming and the next thing

691
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:46.56
you know your overhead is so huge because you got overly aggressive you end up with problems

692
00:58:47.84 --> 00:58:52.72
that is hard too that's so hard because that is absolutely in my nature is to

693
00:58:53.36 --> 00:58:57.04
and I think and to and so many people that resonate with extreme ownership that come to the

694
00:58:57.04 --> 00:59:01.84
monsters that I mean we've got default aggressive leaders that want to go dominate the universe

695
00:59:01.84 --> 00:59:05.84
and you've got to really you've got to really take a step back in the touch and think okay

696
00:59:05.84 --> 00:59:10.08
what am I not thinking about what I'm not seeing how my planning for those contingencies we

697
00:59:10.08 --> 00:59:15.20
just talked about you know a situation today you know with a client where you know they

698
00:59:15.20 --> 00:59:20.40
when things are going really well that's when you've got to be looking at what what what's

699
00:59:20.40 --> 00:59:24.88
what's about to go wrong and I haven't seen yet you know what I'm not planning for so

700
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.68
it is very very difficult to balance this is a leader but you absolutely have to balance that you

701
00:59:29.68 --> 00:59:33.84
have to be aggressive you have to maneuver you know so many people get you know the the

702
00:59:33.84 --> 00:59:38.80
paralysis to analysis you know people talk about don't want to make it make a decision until

703
00:59:38.80 --> 00:59:44.000
you know the solution is right there and it's 100% guarantee nothing is ever 100% guarantee

704
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.52
and by that time that's you know that's even close to being that you know the your

705
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:51.20
competition's already maneuvered on the battlefield you're going to get wiped out and killed

706
00:59:51.20 --> 00:59:55.04
you know in the business world you know you're going to get you're going to get crushed by

707
00:59:55.04 --> 01:00:00.56
your competition and so you and yet being aggressive and also being prudent so that you're not

708
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:05.04
falling in the traps not running to your death not sending your team up for total disaster

709
01:00:05.04 --> 01:00:11.44
and it's it's the only the only answer to this the only answer to this is you have to be balanced

710
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:17.92
that's the only answer because if you go too far in one direction you know if you get super aggressive

711
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:22.96
and you take too much risk and you'll get wiped out if you don't do anything and you sit there

712
01:00:22.96 --> 01:00:28.40
you're going to get wiped out you have to you have to balance these two all the time and

713
01:00:29.28 --> 01:00:35.68
yeah you're right this is something that it's something that we see all the time and I saw

714
01:00:35.68 --> 01:00:40.80
you know training seal platoons you get the guy that's super hyper aggressive and every time

715
01:00:40.80 --> 01:00:45.36
there's something going on there hey let's send a fire team over there and okay you send

716
01:00:45.36 --> 01:00:48.80
a fire team over there and then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team over there okay

717
01:00:48.80 --> 01:00:51.60
then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team next thing you know you're ever

718
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:56.40
a patoon left okay so that was good you got everyone killed because you were hyper aggressive

719
01:00:56.40 --> 01:01:00.000
the other end of the spectrum is what we're not sure where the fire's coming from so we're going to

720
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.60
sit here and wait okay well while you're not shooting at the enemy the enemy is maneuvering

721
01:01:05.60 --> 01:01:09.44
and they are getting high ground and they are getting a superior position and this is the exact

722
01:01:09.44 --> 01:01:15.12
same thing in the business world where I mean the the example of like hey we got to grow and so

723
01:01:15.12 --> 01:01:20.40
the aggressive leader the overly aggressive the hyper aggressive leader will grow too fast

724
01:01:20.40 --> 01:01:27.76
and all of a sudden has overhead that's too much and can't afford to go on but at the same time

725
01:01:27.76 --> 01:01:32.96
you get a you get a company that's not that's not aggressive enough and they should be entering

726
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:38.96
another another line of operation they should be putting they should be entering another market

727
01:01:39.52 --> 01:01:44.32
you know we were talking about this morning while we were working out block blockbuster

728
01:01:44.32 --> 01:01:49.92
and blackberry right blockbuster and blackberry who would have thought that blockbuster which was

729
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:53.76
there was a blockbuster on every street corner there was a block blackberry and everyone's pocket

730
01:01:54.48 --> 01:01:58.72
and they owned something like 80 something percent of the market share that they're done

731
01:01:59.36 --> 01:02:04.24
now are you telling me that someone that was default aggressive would have said you know what

732
01:02:04.88 --> 01:02:09.04
we need to figure out how to you know what these these these movies might be able to come on the

733
01:02:09.04 --> 01:02:13.76
internet in fact there's streaming video let's get into that market and of course they would

734
01:02:13.76 --> 01:02:18.08
have the capital they would have the infrastructure they would have the people and they could

735
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:22.72
they would have been able to make that happen they had relationships with with the with the

736
01:02:23.76 --> 01:02:27.04
with the big Hollywood studios right they were getting sent those movies they had

737
01:02:27.04 --> 01:02:31.76
relationships they could have done that but they were sitting there going we were you're going to

738
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:38.16
come rent these videos for 499 you got to get that VHS tape up in here right if that's the way it's

739
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:42.24
got to be and same thing with blackberry they're thinking on loans gonna leave us because we got the

740
01:02:42.24 --> 01:02:48.08
little thing with the keyboard on it and we're set and meanwhile they're they're both done

741
01:02:48.80 --> 01:02:54.56
done lack of aggressive lack of foresight lack of planning and and for me it's really just lack

742
01:02:54.56 --> 01:02:59.60
of being aggressive aggressively looking around now we could go the other way and we could look at

743
01:02:59.60 --> 01:03:05.76
look at companies that put so much capital out there that they run out of money and they go

744
01:03:05.76 --> 01:03:12.000
they go down to so what do you have to do you have to balance you have to balance such which

745
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.68
you have to do you know one more thing I think we do one more thing from this from this book

746
01:03:19.12 --> 01:03:24.16
just you and this is short little piece we were talking about earlier and it kind of relates

747
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:28.88
to what and I think the reason we were talking about because it was kind of related in the disease

748
01:03:28.88 --> 01:03:35.20
of victory you had that little chunk again we do the we do the applications of business so people can see

749
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:41.20
really directly how these principles in combat and the principal correlates to the civilian

750
01:03:41.20 --> 01:03:51.04
sector but you had a good one just a couple paragraphs on 84 about your kind of a stereotypical fire

751
01:03:51.04 --> 01:03:59.20
up extreme ownership boss that's going to come in there and make stuff happen I thought this was a good one go

752
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:05.60
I've read a lot about patent the executive vice president said with pride referring to general

753
01:04:05.60 --> 01:04:10.96
George S. Paton Jr the famous U.S. Army general who's exploits in World War II were legendary

754
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:15.60
I love that you reference patent in your presentation I want exactly the kind of discipline

755
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:20.56
organization around here that patent expected we need people who carry out orders not

756
01:04:20.56 --> 01:04:26.32
question them I could tell right away that the executive vice president had no previous military

757
01:04:26.32 --> 01:04:31.60
experience he clearly misunderstood how effective leaders in the military led their teams it was not

758
01:04:31.60 --> 01:04:37.92
through rigid authoritarianism do this because I said so or you'll be punished sure there were

759
01:04:37.92 --> 01:04:45.28
those the military who tried to lead like that but it was never effective so there you go and I know

760
01:04:45.28 --> 01:04:50.96
you and I both and the rest of the team has dealt with guys that they they have that vision of

761
01:04:50.96 --> 01:04:54.40
this military leadership and usually it's guys that weren't the military and you know I like to

762
01:04:54.40 --> 01:05:00.40
draw a line and maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong about this I think well and and from what I know

763
01:05:00.96 --> 01:05:09.60
from military history when you go back to conscripts when you when you get to the conscripts those

764
01:05:09.60 --> 01:05:14.000
guys are beaten until they are doing what they you know what they're told to do and we've we've

765
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.88
covered some great examples of that on this podcast of situations where it's like oh you know

766
01:05:18.88 --> 01:05:22.40
what you know how we're going to lead we're going to lead through tyranny and we're going to lead through

767
01:05:22.40 --> 01:05:28.72
punishment and we're going to lead through rigid discipline rigid discipline which obviously everyone

768
01:05:28.72 --> 01:05:33.36
knows I'm a fan of discipline but when you're leading guys and the reason that they're following

769
01:05:33.36 --> 01:05:40.96
your orders is because they fear being beaten or fear being shot that but shot by you you know

770
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:47.44
punished by you if that's why they're again it's the same situation where if that's why they're doing it

771
01:05:47.44 --> 01:05:54.64
you're never going to get the true optimal work and effort out of those people ever and even

772
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:59.60
from from history I mean if you read Alexander the Great right or Julia Caesar who's a great

773
01:05:59.60 --> 01:06:04.80
example and they had conscripts but his men loved him and admired him and held him in tremendous

774
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:10.72
regards because he he rewarded them he gave them credit he he explained well high I mean he was he was a guy

775
01:06:10.72 --> 01:06:17.28
who was always put himself at the forefront of of where the fighting was and you know much more

776
01:06:17.28 --> 01:06:22.64
so than just a political leader like many of the Roman the Roman leaders so just a phenomenal leader

777
01:06:22.64 --> 01:06:27.92
on the battlefield and so even even then you're the most effective leaders are always going to be

778
01:06:27.92 --> 01:06:32.000
they're always going to try to get the team on board with a mission help them understand why they're

779
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.04
doing it put it put a greater purpose in their mind and I think so often as you said before

780
01:06:37.04 --> 01:06:41.36
you know leader leader like that this was this was a aggressive leader great you know great

781
01:06:41.36 --> 01:06:45.28
person who wanted to dominate the universe and and make things happen love extreme ownership

782
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:49.44
and yet is is struggling to see that because they think they're leading like you would lead

783
01:06:49.44 --> 01:06:54.08
they look at they look at a picture jockel like this is what jockel would do it's just crush everyone

784
01:06:54.08 --> 01:06:58.24
and tell them to do it because I said and and as you've explained it doesn't work it doesn't work that

785
01:06:58.24 --> 01:07:03.92
way it's never effective and that's why that's why I'm proud of this book and I think it'd be so

786
01:07:03.92 --> 01:07:08.64
useful to leaders to see you can't do that if you do that you're not ever going to be a success

787
01:07:08.64 --> 01:07:14.40
was you could be if you actually get the team on board explain why to them and and tie that to the

788
01:07:14.40 --> 01:07:18.96
bigger purpose of of what you're trying to accomplish in the world yeah yeah I think that's

789
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:25.76
all true I think the book will be helpful to people so yeah that caught a new leadership it's coming

790
01:07:25.76 --> 01:07:30.80
out September 25th if you want to if you want to get some you can get some of that we got some

791
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:39.52
Q&A we got some questions to discuss here how does jump right into it number one what are

792
01:07:39.52 --> 01:07:45.52
speaking of that this is this is falling together quite nicely question number one what are things

793
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:53.12
to look for when you're debating whether to raise your voice or yell due to those under you being lazy

794
01:07:53.12 --> 01:07:58.80
or unmotivated y'all talk a lot about the importance of self control and not just losing it

795
01:07:59.60 --> 01:08:04.64
but would you say there's a time and place for raising the intensity while still being respectful

796
01:08:04.64 --> 01:08:10.80
towards your guys so there you go yellin and scream it gets them sometimes you gotta just drop the hammer

797
01:08:12.48 --> 01:08:17.76
jocco yelled and scream it us all the time like I've I've talked about on this you know I think on the

798
01:08:17.76 --> 01:08:23.28
podcast we started talking about all the time and the number of times at jocco screamed and yelled at me

799
01:08:24.40 --> 01:08:28.56
zero zero times in all the years that we worked together and and I know I gave him

800
01:08:29.12 --> 01:08:34.24
at least dozens maybe hundreds of opportunities that we want to probably done that and he didn't

801
01:08:34.24 --> 01:08:40.40
do that because he realized it it wasn't effective so now listen there there is there is a time where

802
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:45.20
you know if there's a major safety issue going on you're trying to get people's attention and you

803
01:08:45.20 --> 01:08:49.28
want people to cease fire or you need to rally the truth where you got to raise your voice and

804
01:08:49.28 --> 01:08:53.28
get people's attention and I think that's you can't be afraid to do that as a little bit. There's

805
01:08:53.28 --> 01:08:57.04
certainly times where I say hey life get get those bodies lined up over there or stuff like that I mean

806
01:08:57.04 --> 01:09:02.40
for sure that's is that yelling well yeah I'm definitely raising my voice and using a loud voice but

807
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:10.80
I'm not doing it whatever with anger it's just hey you got to hear me and so and also you know

808
01:09:10.80 --> 01:09:14.96
there is time where you've got to you've got to pick up the intensity in your voice so that people

809
01:09:14.96 --> 01:09:19.76
realize there's something important happening right there's just enough now you don't want to

810
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:25.84
yell and scream and get all crazy but to be like hey I need vehicles here now like that is different

811
01:09:25.84 --> 01:09:29.76
then hey can you get the vehicles over here now right those are two different things and you

812
01:09:30.32 --> 01:09:35.84
I would react differently if I heard those two voices so yes now to go back and this vehicle

813
01:09:35.84 --> 01:09:39.84
over you now no one now we're creating a whole panic situation but that that's a great point too

814
01:09:39.84 --> 01:09:45.92
right and it's it's the kind of you know never cry wolf you know sorry so when when you're if you're

815
01:09:45.92 --> 01:09:50.16
yelling all the time how do you do vehicles over here right now when there's nothing at stake and it's

816
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:55.60
no big deal and it's just a routine movement you know then when you do that and you really need it

817
01:09:56.16 --> 01:10:00.64
then no one's paying attention they think oh it's just life yelling again into the radio so

818
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:07.20
so I think that's another reason why I actually have seen Jaco raised his voice on one occasion

819
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:13.92
yeah and when there was a series issue that needed to be addressed and you needed to get the

820
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:18.96
person's attention to show just how serious of a situation it was and it got everybody's attention

821
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:22.64
yeah it got everybody's attention right away because you never did that and when you did do it

822
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:28.24
it was like oh man yeah and I was always tell that to leaders like being on the radio and this

823
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:31.92
good goes for being in a meeting right if you go to a meeting if you're in charge of a meeting

824
01:10:31.92 --> 01:10:36.16
and you talk the whole time and then you have something important to say at the end well that's great

825
01:10:36.16 --> 01:10:41.12
but it's not as impactful as when you say very few things during the meeting and then at the end you

826
01:10:41.12 --> 01:10:47.04
say hey guys listen up here's what's going on with us and everyone pays attention so I've said this

827
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:52.80
before the last you talk the more people listen and that goes true here the more you yell the last

828
01:10:52.80 --> 01:10:58.16
people listen and it takes away the opportunity if you ever do have to yell it's going to have

829
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:04.72
zero impact so my blanket statement is you should hardly ever have to raise your voice and

830
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:14.08
it should just barely ever happen next question it's a long one can you explain

831
01:11:15.04 --> 01:11:21.52
more how you managed working with the local Iraqi troops general matters who I hold in the

832
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:27.04
highest extreme a steam said something to the effect that if you are doing anything that negatively

833
01:11:27.04 --> 01:11:32.24
impacts relations with allied forces you are of more used to the enemy than you are to the

834
01:11:32.24 --> 01:11:38.40
your team this makes it quite obvious that he believes that full cooperation with allied forces

835
01:11:38.40 --> 01:11:44.16
is key to attaining victory it is a well established fact that most of the Iraqi forces were

836
01:11:44.16 --> 01:11:51.36
incompetent to the point of posing danger to US troops so what steps did you take to ensure success

837
01:11:51.36 --> 01:12:00.72
when working with them well obviously relations with your allies are critical it's cover move

838
01:12:00.72 --> 01:12:05.60
ready you got to work together as a team and if you're working against each other that's absolutely

839
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:13.28
catastrophic I think for us with Iraqi troops you know again we talked about how that was

840
01:12:13.28 --> 01:12:17.92
liberating right for for you know the big pushback was always like we want to do just seal

841
01:12:17.92 --> 01:12:23.36
you don't matter what race we call just seals or just Americans you know just like NATO ally

842
01:12:23.36 --> 01:12:30.96
forces and not work with with Iraqi troops and you know when you said that right away attack

843
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:35.36
that's good listen don't even put up a concept of operations we have a connoisse we call it

844
01:12:35.36 --> 01:12:40.16
which is the approval for the plan that doesn't have Iraqi troops on it okay got it we're going

845
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:44.32
to figure out a way to make that happen so that was the lime was drawn we knew we had to do that

846
01:12:44.32 --> 01:12:48.40
and we knew it was also important I mean because you explained that we talked about it we we thought

847
01:12:48.40 --> 01:12:53.76
through that but obviously we had to take some steps to mitigate that so I think there were

848
01:12:55.04 --> 01:12:59.52
again this is a dichotomy it's you got to be balanced there were I saw units who thought

849
01:13:00.40 --> 01:13:05.44
and we gave some examples even extreme ownership certainly and we talk about regular

850
01:13:05.44 --> 01:13:09.68
about where you you see a unit that would take two or four Americans in a bunch of Iraqis and

851
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:13.44
try to go into really bad area like man you look you're not going to be able to count on those

852
01:13:13.44 --> 01:13:17.84
Iraqis in the middle of a gunfight when they're overwhelmed you better have enough Americans

853
01:13:17.84 --> 01:13:22.88
here to have you back so so they were asking too much of of the Iraqis and then their other

854
01:13:22.88 --> 01:13:25.52
units that didn't want to do you know didn't want to have any Iraqis with them didn't want

855
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:30.88
any relationship with them and I had some stern talking to you know talking to some of my guys

856
01:13:30.88 --> 01:13:35.12
who wouldn't what weren't treating our Iraqi soldiers with respect I threatened one of my

857
01:13:35.12 --> 01:13:39.52
guys who was going to have to go sleep in the Iraqis so just barracks if you didn't go shake their hand

858
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:44.96
I think you know in that time individual who's a great guy I think that was the last threat

859
01:13:44.96 --> 01:13:50.48
you had to make him submit to you I think I was serious the president I'm totally serious

860
01:13:50.48 --> 01:13:56.88
I'm serious so and we all what props to props to SF guys, mid teams that go out there and they do they

861
01:13:56.88 --> 01:14:02.08
live they eat you know even even having to code a mile in here he did two meals a day out of three

862
01:14:02.08 --> 01:14:08.48
with with his afghan soldiers that's that's awesome and you know what I liked about this

863
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:16.16
question was the way that that it relates to to the civilian sector because you know what I talk

864
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:21.28
about a lot a lot of times I talk about how my relationship with my boss regardless of who my boss

865
01:14:21.28 --> 01:14:25.44
was regardless of my boss was great or my boss was horrible my relationship was always the same

866
01:14:25.44 --> 01:14:29.84
I was going to have this great I was going to build relationship where they trusted me they gave me

867
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:33.28
what I needed to do my job and then they let me do my job that's the relationship I always had with all my

868
01:14:33.28 --> 01:14:41.76
bosses right but I I that same methodology and concept can absolutely be applied to other

869
01:14:41.76 --> 01:14:46.40
organizations that you're supposed to work with so whether it's the army whether it's the

870
01:14:46.40 --> 01:14:53.68
Marine Corps whether it's the Iraqi soldiers whether it's the MPs whether it's the I the the intel

871
01:14:53.68 --> 01:14:58.88
people that the intel organization that you're working with no matter what the organization you can

872
01:14:58.88 --> 01:15:04.16
build a relationship again might you love that organization no you might not and where I see this all

873
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:07.76
the time it well we see it all the time now is with businesses because guess what there's no

874
01:15:07.76 --> 01:15:12.56
business that's stand on the worship center is very few that are completely vertically integrated

875
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:17.36
businesses I mean like an origin right we don't we we're pretty vertically integrated but guess

876
01:15:17.36 --> 01:15:21.84
what we don't grow the cotton like we don't do that we don't grow cotton but guess what we have a

877
01:15:21.84 --> 01:15:26.16
good relationship with the people that grow cotton we have a good relationship with the people at

878
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:32.40
stain the cotton or sorry die the cotton so we build those relationships with those other people now

879
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:38.000
I work with businesses where there's a supplier that they don't like so guess what they

880
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.52
form a hostile relationship with this whole company a whole company what could does that do them

881
01:15:43.52 --> 01:15:48.24
it doesn't do them any good at all what it means is they have no personal relationships they

882
01:15:48.24 --> 01:15:53.28
they form that antagonistic relationship with a whole other organization and it's almost impossible to

883
01:15:53.28 --> 01:15:59.68
overcome so now this is something where if you don't explain that culture throughout your team they're

884
01:15:59.68 --> 01:16:03.52
going to treat that other team horribly and so if you're waiting on supplies if you're on a construction

885
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:08.16
site and you're waiting for materials to be delivered and you don't have a good relationship with

886
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:14.16
the people that deliver the drywall and now the drywall's run late for whatever reason and you call

887
01:16:14.16 --> 01:16:20.32
you you fly off the handle or whatever you're you're not going to get that drywall any earlier

888
01:16:20.32 --> 01:16:26.16
it's not happening heavy ever you know when I call customer service right customer service I

889
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:30.56
learned this when I was working for the animal working for the animals aid I'd call up we didn't

890
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:38.16
we travel a lot and I'd have to call up whatever delta or American whoever and I'd be trying to get

891
01:16:38.16 --> 01:16:44.40
whatever seats on an aircraft or something or a flight that was full or whatever get him an upgrade

892
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:50.80
whatever and you know that's a hey how you doing that's always a I always start off with the

893
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:54.72
with the because they're gone American airline how can I help you and they're mad right they're just

894
01:16:54.72 --> 01:17:02.48
mad to start with like how to get their mad whatever you know airline whatever car rental service

895
01:17:02.48 --> 01:17:07.28
whatever restaurant like people are just mad they're care they're mad they don't know who you are

896
01:17:07.28 --> 01:17:11.28
well they actually they've just talked to probably you know the last 25 people of screen

897
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:16.48
screen in the island that's awful so you know you you call them and say hey how's it going and

898
01:17:16.48 --> 01:17:21.84
you know I always I had little head little micro jokes that I would make with the airlines

899
01:17:21.84 --> 01:17:26.16
that I used them with all of them all the time but one of them was I'd say they'd say well

900
01:17:26.16 --> 01:17:30.80
do you need to sit next to your boss and I'd say you know what I'd honestly appreciate it

901
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:34.16
if you put me as far away from it and they'd laugh and then they'd try and hook me up even

902
01:17:34.16 --> 01:17:38.32
though my boss was a great guy and I'd sit with them all day but just it was a funny thing and it

903
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:43.44
humanized me with them they thought I was that some poor sorry bastard that had to travel

904
01:17:43.44 --> 01:17:47.92
with his boss and then they were trying to take care of me it was like awesome so I would get the

905
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:54.000
hookups I remember one time I went up and I had a conversation on the phone with someone and then

906
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.40
of course this is different because it was live but I had a conversation like no can't get

907
01:17:56.40 --> 01:18:00.24
you on that flight and then I went up to the counter and I was like hey how you doing I'm trying

908
01:18:00.24 --> 01:18:03.84
to get me in my boss and it's on this flight and we're trying to get there and and he's acting

909
01:18:03.84 --> 01:18:08.40
like this gross like well what do you know do you need to go to him like well look if we don't get there

910
01:18:08.88 --> 01:18:13.92
here's the deal if you can just get my boss on that's great if if neither one of us get

911
01:18:13.92 --> 01:18:20.56
get on this flight it's been nice knowing you because I'm screwed and she just started laughing

912
01:18:20.56 --> 01:18:24.40
and again humanized it and then it's like all of a sudden she's like oh guess what we're going

913
01:18:24.40 --> 01:18:27.76
to we're going to bump some of these or whatever and she's making room and we're on the flight

914
01:18:28.32 --> 01:18:33.20
so don't develop this antagonistic relationship with another organization

915
01:18:33.20 --> 01:18:38.08
with Iraqi soldiers like is it great working with Iraqi soldiers? No it sucks it's hard

916
01:18:38.88 --> 01:18:43.84
but guess what that's what we have to do and I'll tell you something else strategically

917
01:18:45.28 --> 01:18:51.76
the Iraqi soldiers that are descendants of the guys that we train I mean maybe not I'm saying training

918
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.76
or or training descendants right the guys that we trained trained to guys who just went and

919
01:18:57.76 --> 01:19:03.12
fought back and got Ramadi back from ISIS and got Mazul back from ISIS those are the guys

920
01:19:03.12 --> 01:19:05.84
that went in there and did the bulk of the fight did they get supported by Americans yes did

921
01:19:05.84 --> 01:19:11.04
Americans do a kick-ass job of doing massive fire support yes but the guys that were moving from street

922
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:16.64
to street those were majority Iraqi soldiers did they have special ops guys with them yes but

923
01:19:16.64 --> 01:19:20.000
it was a majority of the people that were moving through the streets where Iraqi soldiers

924
01:19:20.64 --> 01:19:26.40
and there's no way possible that wouldn't have happened if American coalition forces

925
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:32.96
over the last whatever it was 10 years 12 years would have taken those guys and made them work

926
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:38.40
and done the the type of partner missions that we did with them so it was and when I said again

927
01:19:38.40 --> 01:19:44.000
when I say we are not talking about us the the seal teams I'm talking about everyone everyone made

928
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.52
this concerted effort and it ended up being a great call because when those guys went out to

929
01:19:50.64 --> 01:19:54.32
to finally have to fight to take these cities back they were able to do it

930
01:19:54.32 --> 01:19:59.36
not totally by themselves but they were able to do it they did it and that's a vast improvement

931
01:19:59.36 --> 01:20:04.08
if we were to send if we would have sent the Iraqi troops as they were when we were in

932
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:10.96
Ramadi into Mazul they would have gotten decimated so it's a credit to the US military it's a

933
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:14.96
credit to the Iraqi military that they have now gotten up to speed where they can push forward

934
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:19.20
and it's a credit to the US military and other coalition forces that worked with them to get them

935
01:20:19.20 --> 01:20:26.16
up to speed and what that all boils back to is forming relationships with the people that you

936
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:30.88
are dependent on not just the people but the organizations that's all it's in.

937
01:20:32.24 --> 01:20:38.64
Yeah I think they we learn less and it's let's do let's use them for their tricks and that's

938
01:20:38.64 --> 01:20:43.76
what we learn in Ramadi we put them in situations where they could succeed we took enough

939
01:20:43.76 --> 01:20:49.28
Americans where we could actually succeed and help them succeed and of course we put some

940
01:20:50.40 --> 01:20:54.56
some efforts to mitigate rest too with with all we always said armed guys the oil head guys

941
01:20:54.56 --> 01:20:58.96
looking around we always with presented a hard target if one of those guys decided that they wanted

942
01:20:58.96 --> 01:21:04.88
to start batting for the other team and we were in a position to handle those problems and we never had

943
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:09.68
any issues as a result but that's what you have to do is it's all about building coalitions and

944
01:21:09.68 --> 01:21:14.16
using people's strengths and complimenting those strengths and working with the team it's

945
01:21:14.16 --> 01:21:18.56
cover move if you don't do that you're going to you're going to fail and to all you people at the

946
01:21:18.56 --> 01:21:24.08
airlines thank you thank you for taking care of me over the years appreciate it next question

947
01:21:25.20 --> 01:21:34.40
jocco lathe and echo your opinion has been solicited on this leadership question right here

948
01:21:34.40 --> 01:21:40.000
so we'll see how that works out a good leader ensures his team understands what their goals are

949
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.64
and why they are performing tasks but how do you balance doing this with not being the leader that

950
01:21:46.64 --> 01:21:51.52
talks so much that the team stops listening we do we just cover this for a long period of time pretty

951
01:21:51.52 --> 01:21:57.04
much it didn't we I guess we can leave it at this echo do you agree with what we said earlier

952
01:21:57.04 --> 01:22:02.64
or do you have a different opinion about talking too much and mind you you've said a lot today

953
01:22:02.64 --> 01:22:06.80
so don't be you know don't get crazy over it will stop listening

954
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:16.80
the guy who talks too much no yeah less is more hundred percent go I like it

955
01:22:17.52 --> 01:22:22.56
I will say it musters when echo's echo's words to the audience

956
01:22:23.52 --> 01:22:27.84
he always gives an epic speech with we have solicited probably the greatest applause of

957
01:22:27.84 --> 01:22:35.60
everyone yeah I guess to dig into this a little bit of how to balance that with being a leader

958
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:39.28
that talks too much I think you got to pay attention to what the reactions are you're getting

959
01:22:39.28 --> 01:22:44.32
for people right you got to pay attention to the reactions you're getting for people if the people are not

960
01:22:45.68 --> 01:22:52.000
totally actively listening to you right if they're not actively listening to you if they're

961
01:22:52.56 --> 01:22:56.48
taking notes if they're looking at their phone or not taking notes but if they're looking at their phone

962
01:22:56.48 --> 01:23:03.20
or whatever then you're you're talking too much keep it short keep concise and people will listen to

963
01:23:03.20 --> 01:23:10.80
you more also that when you say you got to pay attention to yourself that's like a deep one it's

964
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:14.32
like you just said it really simply like I just pay attention to yourself I mean you didn't

965
01:23:14.32 --> 01:23:18.40
say like that but that's what it's telling that's the hardest part right there because a lot of

966
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:22.88
times like hey me and life are talking and later it's looking at his phone I'm not thinking

967
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:27.20
hey I'm talking too much I'm saying what I'm saying it's not interesting enough so I need so I need to say

968
01:23:27.20 --> 01:23:32.40
some more cool stuff or I need to be more of this or more of that because I'm losing them kind of thing

969
01:23:32.40 --> 01:23:38.48
like if I'm losing you the intuitive thought is not to to completely disconnect and stop talking that's

970
01:23:38.48 --> 01:23:43.36
not the intuitive thought seems like when you're in a situation you got to pay attention to that

971
01:23:43.36 --> 01:23:48.08
kind of stuff on yourself jocca does this all the time what do I do like buses phone out and

972
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:53.52
start so yeah I don't even know whatever actually you know what okay I guess our conversation you know

973
01:23:53.52 --> 01:24:00.000
you know I do that to Dean and Dean Mr so Dean Dean is oh yeah this is a really important

974
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.40
stuff we're talking about here is like yeah no what Dean does always he it makes him mad right he's

975
01:24:04.40 --> 01:24:10.96
got the he's got the pet peeve so Dean will be telling something and so you're doing a purpose to get

976
01:24:10.96 --> 01:24:17.60
a excuse no sometimes he's saying some rambling stuff right and I've got stuff going on Dean

977
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:22.16
come on I know you're listening to this bro but sometimes he'll be saying something to me and all

978
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:27.92
of the sudden I'll like look around up and and now I realize I'll just be watching people do

979
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:31.60
do you just because we're normally on the map what this happens so he's telling me something like

980
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:36.48
looking at the eyes and he's like you know in the ancient bubble bubble boy he'll be telling me

981
01:24:36.48 --> 01:24:42.000
about the Peloponnesian more something or whatever and and as I'm listening to him I'll kind of

982
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.96
look and I'll start looking at someone that's training or looking at someone and he'll like attack

983
01:24:46.96 --> 01:24:53.12
me he went through a period where he would just attack me and like take me down and just start

984
01:24:53.12 --> 01:24:59.36
you know going psycho on me so that got me tuned up I got me tuned up where I tried to give Dean

985
01:24:59.36 --> 01:25:03.92
some more attention yeah I like that yeah I think that's uh I think that's a good

986
01:25:03.92 --> 01:25:07.92
cause that's what you feel like when he starts doing that sort of the brats you what you're doing

987
01:25:07.92 --> 01:25:12.000
you know well the thing is though and I think you're in the same boat late for where I know

988
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.36
you kind of know now like in everyday life with other people you might think I mean intuitively

989
01:25:17.36 --> 01:25:22.000
anyway like on losing them or whatever but you can tell with him if he starts doing that stuff you're like

990
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.20
okay he's the most stop or yeah move on or something but it's all because you know the same

991
01:25:27.20 --> 01:25:34.56
as I listen if you can give me 35 more seconds we'll be honest and if you can move on to whatever you need to

992
01:25:34.56 --> 01:25:39.12
bad character or something that I have where I can do that sometimes I'm done listening to you

993
01:25:39.92 --> 01:25:46.16
so wrap it up of course you see all the time yeah just your one time asmba system all right

994
01:25:46.16 --> 01:25:55.36
next question for life this is a guy who have he won you know what all right life

995
01:25:55.36 --> 01:26:03.68
in and out burger or what a burger dude I do not want to go there man that is too much

996
01:26:04.32 --> 01:26:13.20
that's like double rainbow too much right this is uh I gotta I gotta tell you look obviously

997
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:17.52
I'm from Texas water burgers are all over the place and water burgers are awesome you can't

998
01:26:17.52 --> 01:26:22.64
go wrong with the water burger um in and out is uh it's pretty tough to be though it's uh there's

999
01:26:22.64 --> 01:26:27.68
something special about the internet I used to have you know over Pacific Beach I had a storage unit

1000
01:26:27.68 --> 01:26:33.44
over there and there's like my storage unit was like right in and up or a hill those are good burgers

1001
01:26:36.96 --> 01:26:42.32
the uh my storage unit was it would like kick the exhaust or like right back up into

1002
01:26:42.32 --> 01:26:48.48
and so so like the exhaust blasting in your face you know from like 25 yards 30 yards away

1003
01:26:48.48 --> 01:26:54.000
as I'm like there at my storage unit on the server for whatever and I was like double double we're

1004
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.56
getting some double double so yeah internet is awesome it's it's tough to beat I'm a huge fan

1005
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:04.56
internet I will say this though where's the meat man come on those burgers you gotta put

1006
01:27:04.56 --> 01:27:09.60
what a burger you gotta a lot more more patty yeah well apparently you're not a working in the triple triple

1007
01:27:09.60 --> 01:27:16.24
that's what we need quadruple quadruple yeah that's what we got there my my kids after they

1008
01:27:16.24 --> 01:27:22.32
would cut weight for wrestling season I spent more money in an out burger during wrestling season

1009
01:27:22.32 --> 01:27:26.32
because after they cut weight and then they rest all day and then you're going home and all they

1010
01:27:26.32 --> 01:27:32.08
want to do is go in an out burger in an out burger yeah it's it cutting weight for me is the

1011
01:27:32.08 --> 01:27:36.40
very I mean playing football is like maybe one of these big and fabulous plastic and this is

1012
01:27:36.40 --> 01:27:42.64
crush food yeah check all right speaking of well like a speaking of combat sports

1013
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:51.52
next question six this is your jitz of question should instructors not teach white belts

1014
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:59.04
aka lathe babbin david berk and jp to nail that's cold blood it's a good deal to you that is

1015
01:27:59.04 --> 01:28:08.000
good deal to you they should instructors not teach white belts certain techniques or should

1016
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.56
why they shouldn't do them be explained but still expose the white belts to techniques

1017
01:28:14.56 --> 01:28:19.12
set the white belts recognize them so there's some techniques that you don't get taught very often

1018
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:26.40
as a white belt for instance a heel look I believe that it is good to not teach people a

1019
01:28:26.40 --> 01:28:33.76
teach white belts to do heel hooks because the for example heel hooks can be very dangerous

1020
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:39.36
the reason that they're dangerous because they don't hurt a lot before they injure you and so white belts

1021
01:28:39.36 --> 01:28:46.48
who are by nature completely insane and going crazy and going nuts and so when they get a

1022
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:49.68
hold of something they just go as hard as they can and by the way they're usually going against the

1023
01:28:49.68 --> 01:28:51.84
white belt that's the only reason they're getting anything on them because they're going

1024
01:28:51.84 --> 01:28:55.28
against white belt and that other white belt's going completely insane and he's not going to tap

1025
01:28:55.28 --> 01:29:03.60
and so what happens you get the triple triple lindi right ACL MCL PCL tear game over

1026
01:29:03.60 --> 01:29:07.92
this guy's never trained in jjitsu again or this guy's not trained in jjitsu for two years or

1027
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:17.36
whatever so is it smart to not teach them yes it is however dichotomy balance should you just

1028
01:29:17.36 --> 01:29:22.40
never show them what they are no you should you should explain to them hey this is what the move is this is

1029
01:29:22.40 --> 01:29:26.96
this is why we don't teach them this is why we don't teach them because you can get hurt

1030
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:29.68
and when you get a little bit more advanced and you learn to relax a little bit more we'll teach

1031
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:34.72
you some of these these techniques that are slightly more dangerous do you know he's freaks out because

1032
01:29:36.16 --> 01:29:42.64
saying that a heel hook is more dangerous than a then a comira I mean if you ask me what I want

1033
01:29:42.64 --> 01:29:47.20
to have somebody just go berserk on a cus cumira on me or a heel hook I'd probably pick the heel

1034
01:29:47.20 --> 01:29:53.28
hook right because then you you still have shoulder mobility whereas cumira that's that's just

1035
01:29:53.28 --> 01:29:57.52
if someone goes nuts on a cumira and just rip your arm up your shoulder apart what would you

1036
01:29:57.52 --> 01:30:04.48
rather have yeah I'm thinking to put all day long so but for some reason it's kind of a rough choice

1037
01:30:04.48 --> 01:30:09.04
there that is a rough choice that is a rough choice that's not a choice you want to be making

1038
01:30:09.04 --> 01:30:13.84
because either one of them's not good but I think you can do a better job of replacing the knee

1039
01:30:13.84 --> 01:30:19.92
and getting the knee squared away then you can the shoulder there's no the shoulders tough but for

1040
01:30:19.92 --> 01:30:24.32
some reason the cumira is everyone you're learning cumira day one right day three you're learning

1041
01:30:24.32 --> 01:30:30.72
cumira and you could definitely trash someone shoulder but it hurts it does hurt been that's

1042
01:30:30.72 --> 01:30:35.36
beneficial yeah I need the shoulders gonna have a way more flexibility than your little your knee

1043
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:40.32
twisting joint you like that's that you can't be like hey I'm so I'm gonna let you get some

1044
01:30:40.32 --> 01:30:46.32
jump double jump to your knees of bone and you actually right show you guys who can you

1045
01:30:46.32 --> 01:30:51.68
shoulder you know just varying levels of shoulder flexibility and then that also goes for like the

1046
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:57.12
pain tolerance as well knees last way less from from a wide bill perspective there's so much

1047
01:30:57.12 --> 01:31:02.000
to to learn I mean it's you know and the more I train the more I realize how little I actually

1048
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:08.24
know and how much more there is that I mean why I would I would I would I would rather focus on you know

1049
01:31:09.12 --> 01:31:14.80
on the more the more foundational aspects of the game and until I can get those a little bit better

1050
01:31:14.80 --> 01:31:18.72
I think that makes a lot of sense to me I think you might be the bull white belt right now of the

1051
01:31:18.72 --> 01:31:26.40
world so in the in the navy the ensin which is the lowest ranking ensin at a ship or a seal

1052
01:31:26.40 --> 01:31:32.56
team he gets called the bull ensin which means he's been the junior guy for the longest amount of

1053
01:31:32.56 --> 01:31:37.36
time and you've been trained she's your footer quite some would you well you start training with me

1054
01:31:37.36 --> 01:31:44.24
in 2005 right yep can you train before me with Fabio I train a few times okay so you've been trained

1055
01:31:44.24 --> 01:31:53.04
since oh three oh four that's been a long time bro most of that's 14 years most of that 14 years

1056
01:31:53.60 --> 01:31:58.16
I'd say I've been seriously training for you know probably probably like back at it you know

1057
01:31:58.16 --> 01:32:03.60
pretty consistently you know multiple times a week for year and a half okay so yours year in

1058
01:32:03.60 --> 01:32:08.32
the zone you're in the zone you be getting that blue belt you at some point Todd White down in Texas

1059
01:32:08.32 --> 01:32:13.28
I'm gonna crack it out possibly I don't know maybe you're not ready though I'll make my dad wait

1060
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.80
Todd White I'm definitely not ready he's the good you going no you got nothing you got nothing

1061
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:27.12
check so yeah that's I think the deal same thing with same thing uh the other problem with teaching

1062
01:32:27.12 --> 01:32:32.000
a person for instance he'll hooks is then they think that that's the solution to the guard

1063
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:40.08
and it's not the solution to the guard it's a solution to the guard it's a one possible one one

1064
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:45.36
one small possible one a solution there's many many more and there's others as you said

1065
01:32:45.36 --> 01:32:53.44
life that are more fundamental so it's that's my that's my answer yeah that thing um how you say

1066
01:32:53.44 --> 01:32:59.68
the like let them know what it is yeah and well when you consider an actual typical White belt class

1067
01:32:59.68 --> 01:33:04.40
they hook it's probably not gonna be introduced in any significant capacity yeah at all like no one's

1068
01:33:04.40 --> 01:33:09.92
gonna choose to spend time in a White belt class to teach a hill yeah typically is not gonna happen

1069
01:33:09.92 --> 01:33:14.32
but like the control thing right like you know you get a even a good blue belt is been in for a

1070
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:19.20
long time per belt up purple belt and up they're gonna know the control on a hill hook like if I

1071
01:33:19.20 --> 01:33:24.80
you know purple belt doesn't heal hook on you the risk of you getting injured unless you don't

1072
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:29.20
tap or something like that is pretty low it's gonna be pretty low because they know that control of just

1073
01:33:29.20 --> 01:33:33.44
their whole body and you don't know you should tap exactly right yeah so the White belt they don't

1074
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:39.84
even have control very important they don't have control or they have a lot less control in everything

1075
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:45.36
by the way there's a strong possibility there's a strong person but that's with everything like

1076
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:52.32
even on a defending a take down it's like so odd a couple as a blue belt I heal hook to a friend of mine

1077
01:33:52.32 --> 01:34:01.92
and I heard him and I didn't it wasn't even he was he was a no nothing right and we're going and

1078
01:34:01.92 --> 01:34:07.52
I just started learning hill hooks and I put a hill hook on him and we were overseas and I put a hill

1079
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:12.08
hook on him and he wasn't tapping and I was kind of like well that's weird you know why is

1080
01:34:12.08 --> 01:34:16.08
he tapping so I went a little bit harder and then all of a sudden there was a little pop and I let

1081
01:34:16.08 --> 01:34:23.12
go and I was like and yeah but you know he was a seal and so he was like all this is gonna work on me

1082
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:27.84
he doesn't hurt and all of a sudden so I I wasn't going nuts because like I said I was a blue belt

1083
01:34:27.84 --> 01:34:35.92
I was in pretty good control but even I didn't realize at that time oh this will injure him before it will

1084
01:34:36.72 --> 01:34:42.88
cause pain which is a bad thing to have yeah these kids I mean he's guys if they're

1085
01:34:42.88 --> 01:34:48.48
no one has control over anything by the way any any other moves and they're doing hill hooks as a

1086
01:34:48.48 --> 01:34:52.72
normal thing like oh yeah we do we got taught this and stuff and it's effective you know like a

1087
01:34:52.72 --> 01:34:57.84
lot of submissions and hill hooks and a lot of foot locks are one of those ones where you to gain

1088
01:34:57.84 --> 01:35:03.28
the position to go for that submission you have to work a lot less than like an arm bar where you

1089
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:07.52
have to actually pass someone's guard and you know getting even side control but a lot of times get

1090
01:35:07.52 --> 01:35:11.60
to the you know you got to work more to get into the position with hill hooks not not not so much

1091
01:35:11.60 --> 01:35:17.84
like that so if you know yeah you can just throw it out there and you throw in the lack of control yeah

1092
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:26.48
man so you increase the chance for injury for sure all right next question I am a 66 year old

1093
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:35.12
police chief and CrossFit athlete is your muster doable for me absolutely there'll be plenty of

1094
01:35:35.12 --> 01:35:42.24
people who are in your age group and there's no question that you should come and join us for

1095
01:35:42.24 --> 01:35:47.44
monster get after if you're your police chief across for athlete you can more more than get after

1096
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:54.64
with the the 445 club workouts are voluntary we usually have I mean we probably have what you know 80

1097
01:35:54.64 --> 01:35:59.68
85% of our participation I mean is massive but they're they're designed so that really anybody can

1098
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:04.48
do we have people with top level athletes down to you know folks who look like the private

1099
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:09.36
men of the gym hold on yeah we have the fact you started to get so I remember one guy that was

1100
01:36:09.36 --> 01:36:13.76
I'm heading in for doubled knee surgery in a week and so I'm just and he was an older guy you know

1101
01:36:13.76 --> 01:36:19.44
then had been out of the gym for a bit and he was out there like you said that the the workouts are

1102
01:36:19.44 --> 01:36:26.72
scaleable to the individual that's participating in the in the event and so we at all every level

1103
01:36:26.72 --> 01:36:30.72
you can come to the monster in any literally in any physical condition you can come to the

1104
01:36:30.72 --> 01:36:41.36
monster and you can you can get after it with us next question I find meetings of greater than

1105
01:36:42.24 --> 01:36:51.28
or equal to eight people far less productive than smaller groups even with structured action

1106
01:36:51.28 --> 01:37:03.12
oriented agenda is there a maximum amount of people you'd involve in a strategic or tactical planning group

1107
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:06.80
I don't think I don't think there is a maximum amount I think it just has to be controlled

1108
01:37:06.80 --> 01:37:11.20
and you've got to have you've got to have some decentralized command or people understand if there's

1109
01:37:11.20 --> 01:37:16.96
just a bunch of people that meeting and everyone's kind of speaking in turn and talking over

1110
01:37:16.96 --> 01:37:19.44
each other you're not going to get anything done so you got to have there's got to be one

1111
01:37:19.44 --> 01:37:24.48
leader who's run that there's got to be some some you know some other subordinate leaders that

1112
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:29.52
and one person has got to drive that meeting and make sure that when someone starts going

1113
01:37:29.52 --> 01:37:34.80
in down a rabbit hole okay you guys have a sidebar conversation afterward let's keep this meeting

1114
01:37:34.80 --> 01:37:40.48
focused and let's and ultimately the decision maker who can focus the team on a single course of action

1115
01:37:40.48 --> 01:37:45.20
get her by behind them I agree and there's certainly times where you can bring too many people

1116
01:37:45.20 --> 01:37:48.96
into trying to figure something out I mean that can certainly happen and we we have the good idea

1117
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:52.24
fairies that keep coming around with their good ideas and cause I don't know what if we did this

1118
01:37:52.24 --> 01:37:56.48
I wonder if we did that there's also an interesting dynamic that you just pointed out that ties into a

1119
01:37:56.48 --> 01:38:02.32
question that we had earlier or something that we were talking about earlier which is okay so let's

1120
01:38:02.32 --> 01:38:08.32
say we have a meeting and there's 15 people in that meeting if the leader of that meeting then

1121
01:38:08.32 --> 01:38:17.60
we'll say steps down into the position of being the the director of the meeting itself

1122
01:38:18.80 --> 01:38:22.96
he guess what he's doing all the time he's talking he's pulling things he's get and what he's doing

1123
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:27.44
while he's doing that is he's getting in the weeds of what's going on so as he's getting in the weeds

1124
01:38:27.44 --> 01:38:32.96
of what's going on he's losing this strategic vision and so if there's 20 people in a meeting

1125
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:36.08
and you as the leader are going okay what do you think what do you think what do you think

1126
01:38:36.08 --> 01:38:41.84
and hey no let's get it focused when you're doing all that traffic copying you're actually

1127
01:38:41.84 --> 01:38:46.32
losing your strategic altitude you're not going to be able to see and make a good clear decision

1128
01:38:46.32 --> 01:38:53.76
so if there's 30 40 50 people in a meeting and you as the leader get down in the weeds

1129
01:38:53.76 --> 01:38:58.40
and get down in the trenches and you start throwing down with everyone well it's not going to take

1130
01:38:58.40 --> 01:39:02.96
very long well you're just you're just one of the troops and you don't see anything where is if you

1131
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:08.32
let let one of the other leaders let one of the subordinate leaders let them step up let them start to

1132
01:39:08.32 --> 01:39:12.88
do their thing let them do the direction of the meeting you might even tell them hey run this meeting

1133
01:39:12.88 --> 01:39:17.92
I would do that I'd be like hey you run this meeting and then you let them get in there and the

1134
01:39:17.92 --> 01:39:22.40
trenches and let them try and sort out ideas and they're mind gets filled with a bunch of crap and meanwhile

1135
01:39:22.40 --> 01:39:27.52
you're in the meeting you're just not running it so there's a big difference between running the meeting

1136
01:39:27.52 --> 01:39:32.56
and overseeing the meeting or being in the meeting or being a leading leader of the meeting so

1137
01:39:32.56 --> 01:39:37.20
if we're going through a kill house or if we're going if we're going through a kill house that's a

1138
01:39:37.20 --> 01:39:40.72
good example which is the you know the room with the building with a bunch of rooms and it if

1139
01:39:41.36 --> 01:39:47.60
as the leader you don't say hey I'm gonna run this kill house I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

1140
01:39:47.60 --> 01:39:51.20
direct the movement through the kill house because then guess what you're doing you're directing

1141
01:39:51.20 --> 01:39:56.72
the movement through the kill house what you want to do is take a step back and say hey you

1142
01:39:56.72 --> 01:40:03.52
third, fourth, fifth in the chain of command you run this kill house you run the train and now

1143
01:40:03.52 --> 01:40:08.000
that guy goes okay cool I got it and now while he's running the train doing the work you're

1144
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.80
step back and out too you can see what's going on you can hear the frustration you can hear

1145
01:40:12.80 --> 01:40:18.32
shots fired you know where people are moving then you become you're the real leader so

1146
01:40:18.32 --> 01:40:22.64
same thing in a meeting the dynamics of the meeting or you get more than 10 people 15 people

1147
01:40:22.64 --> 01:40:26.48
and what you're doing is you're down there directing traffic it's gonna be really problematic

1148
01:40:26.48 --> 01:40:33.20
for you if you have a meeting with 15 or 20 people and you tell someone else to direct the meeting

1149
01:40:33.20 --> 01:40:38.96
and run the meeting and you take a step up and you simply observe you're gonna have a better time

1150
01:40:41.04 --> 01:40:45.52
feeling like the meeting is effective and you will get the benefit of hearing all these different

1151
01:40:45.52 --> 01:40:50.16
voices which is good which is good to hear all these different opinions and voices and be able to pick

1152
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:55.28
through and sort through and that's gonna give you more benefit than you know what I get there's

1153
01:40:55.28 --> 01:40:58.96
two it's going on this meeting only give me two people and we'll make the decisions well there's

1154
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:04.40
some people number number the six person that person had a good input right the 12 person might

1155
01:41:04.40 --> 01:41:09.68
had some good input so again is there balance yes are there certain decisions that you kind of

1156
01:41:09.68 --> 01:41:16.56
need to take and really dive down in with a small group absolutely but is it good sometimes to let

1157
01:41:16.56 --> 01:41:21.44
things air out and let someone run a meeting and you listen and you learn kind of what the overall

1158
01:41:21.44 --> 01:41:27.68
atmosphere is in the situation are absolutely that's my answer I think it's a great one it helps

1159
01:41:27.68 --> 01:41:32.16
people it helps people listen to you as well right I mean when if you're the boss and you're just

1160
01:41:32.16 --> 01:41:35.52
sitting back and you're not saying anything and then all of a sudden you're like hey guys we're

1161
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:40.16
getting way off topic here this is what we need to do here's the direction we need to go got it everyone's

1162
01:41:40.16 --> 01:41:45.12
you know back on track whereas if you're in the middle of it then yeah people are just automatically

1163
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:47.84
you know kind of doing there I'm sure we said this before and I know we talked about it really

1164
01:41:47.84 --> 01:41:52.64
to be like when I would say something on the radio and task unit bruiser when I would say like a

1165
01:41:52.64 --> 01:41:59.60
legitimate thing man it would happen if I got on and said everyone get the building 34 now people would

1166
01:41:59.60 --> 01:42:04.16
go and one of my favorite things to do one of my favorite conversations to have on the radio

1167
01:42:04.16 --> 01:42:10.64
with with either you or stoner was like I remember you'd be like you'd say hey Jocco we got another

1168
01:42:10.64 --> 01:42:15.20
mover where I want to take down building 34 and I'd come up and go do it that was all I'd ever

1169
01:42:15.20 --> 01:42:21.28
said be like do it and I just like go because I'm not trying to talk right I got these guys got

1170
01:42:21.28 --> 01:42:26.40
their situation tandled hey he's going outside of something that we planned hey Jocco want to

1171
01:42:26.40 --> 01:42:32.64
build a move to building 34 and take that thing down do it not well why do you want to do that you

1172
01:42:32.64 --> 01:42:35.84
know why he wants to do it because he's got a good reason he's not asking me that because it's a

1173
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:40.24
fantasy that he thinks it's going to be cool no there's a reason and he'll explain that to me later

1174
01:42:40.24 --> 01:42:44.48
and if it was something where he's like I want to you know start doing jumping jacks out here

1175
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:49.36
then I might ask why because that doesn't make my sense to me but to say hey we're hitting

1176
01:42:49.36 --> 01:42:54.96
building 34 as well what if we were doing burpees with that make more sense that makes a little

1177
01:42:54.96 --> 01:43:01.20
more sense little more sense than jumping jacks look that that actually worked it worked for us

1178
01:43:01.20 --> 01:43:05.84
when you when you said some of the radio like got it we're good like it the decision made

1179
01:43:05.84 --> 01:43:12.96
everyone's on board and I think it's it's something that you've got to you've got to focus on

1180
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:16.64
with like when a leader talks it should matter and and I think you can be you got to be really

1181
01:43:16.64 --> 01:43:21.68
careful about that and I've certainly been a chief violator that of like going off a two to

1182
01:43:21.68 --> 01:43:26.64
too many different directions but that you did extremely well at Tassian bruiser and it works

1183
01:43:26.64 --> 01:43:30.88
and every later should be very Congress of them yeah the last you talked the more people listen

1184
01:43:30.88 --> 01:43:42.40
all right next in a in a middle management position what's the best way to support the company

1185
01:43:42.40 --> 01:43:50.08
and leadership you work for while still showing your fellow workers they are supported and appreciated

1186
01:43:51.12 --> 01:43:56.16
I work in surgery at a large hospital within even larger corporation

1187
01:43:58.72 --> 01:44:03.12
this is one of those things and I remember saying I'm sure I got this from hackworth but it's one of

1188
01:44:03.12 --> 01:44:08.48
those things that I've said so many times I actually probably forget to even give credit to hackworth

1189
01:44:08.48 --> 01:44:13.12
but you know when problems little problems would arise up the chain of command and I'd be like

1190
01:44:13.12 --> 01:44:19.36
everyone hates the echelon of command above them right that's the way it is like and that's just

1191
01:44:19.36 --> 01:44:23.52
the way it is that's the way it is it's always they don't get it so they don't understand

1192
01:44:24.56 --> 01:44:29.60
unless you get somebody that really knows how to explain and communicate down the chain of

1193
01:44:29.60 --> 01:44:33.52
commands that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing that's what this is that's

1194
01:44:33.52 --> 01:44:38.08
exactly what this is like if it what's the best way to support the company leadership it's to

1195
01:44:38.08 --> 01:44:43.60
take what the company and the leadership of the company says and translate it to the troops

1196
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:49.84
in a way that they understand and that means something to them right so you go to a big meeting

1197
01:44:50.88 --> 01:44:57.04
and you know like let's say in all hands meeting for a company and and the CEO is saying

1198
01:44:58.64 --> 01:45:03.68
hey we made you know we made 87 million dollars last year profit and if all the front line

1199
01:45:03.68 --> 01:45:12.64
troops are in there they're like well that's cool but I didn't see that reflected in my pay

1200
01:45:12.64 --> 01:45:18.000
check by the way you gave me a $4 raise over the last three years how about some of that 87

1201
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.40
million kick it down to the people so that's problematic because we aren't explaining hey good that's

1202
01:45:24.40 --> 01:45:29.12
it that literally that statement right there will actually make people mad the the the the CEO's

1203
01:45:29.12 --> 01:45:33.12
thinking everyone's gonna love me because I'm telling how profitable we are as a company all

1204
01:45:33.12 --> 01:45:36.56
everyone's thinking as a little bit why can't you afford to buy me that piece of gear that we

1205
01:45:36.56 --> 01:45:41.76
need on the front lines what's your problem that's so you actually think you're helping but you're

1206
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:46.16
actually hurting unless you can explain to people look we made this much profit here's how it's

1207
01:45:46.16 --> 01:45:51.68
gonna benefit us as a company and you as a front line troop by us making this much money it means

1208
01:45:51.68 --> 01:45:55.36
we can grow these areas it means we can bring on more people that means everyone in this room right

1209
01:45:55.36 --> 01:45:59.92
now in the next three years you're gonna have an opportunity to be in a leadership position that's

1210
01:45:59.92 --> 01:46:03.20
why I'm talking about that's why we're trying to grow that's why we're trying to do better by the way

1211
01:46:03.84 --> 01:46:07.76
as we this is snowballing even more because now we're putting more money into advertising we've got

1212
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:11.20
whole advertising campaign that's going out we've invested a bunch of money in that and it's gonna

1213
01:46:11.20 --> 01:46:15.76
bring us more business and that means the jobs that you think might not be stable your job if you

1214
01:46:15.76 --> 01:46:21.44
don't think it's stable it just got stable because we have the capital to get this machine moving

1215
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:28.40
even faster so when you do that when you explain to the troops why something's happening it makes

1216
01:46:28.40 --> 01:46:35.36
them understand and it shows your people hey you're supporting are there times where you should push back

1217
01:46:35.36 --> 01:46:40.64
yes there are and if something makes no sense whatsoever you should raise your hand it's hey

1218
01:46:40.64 --> 01:46:44.80
let me let me let me run this up the chain of command let me run this up the chain of command and

1219
01:46:44.80 --> 01:46:49.12
explain why this is in a good idea and that way you can go and when you get the reason because they'll

1220
01:46:49.12 --> 01:46:53.44
be a reason and it might not be the best reason but it'll be a reason and you go back to troops and

1221
01:46:53.44 --> 01:46:57.52
say hey here's why this is going on this is what's happening this is the decision they made

1222
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:02.72
and you know what we're gonna do our best to execute it because that's what we do we make things happen

1223
01:47:02.72 --> 01:47:08.88
we're gonna get it done boom and we got a great we've got a great depiction of that in

1224
01:47:08.88 --> 01:47:13.92
and talking about being humble not passive and pushing back where it matters in the deck out of

1225
01:47:13.92 --> 01:47:18.88
me leadership that's that whole section is talking exactly about that it's a very hard thing

1226
01:47:18.88 --> 01:47:23.20
you know for people and that the the basis of this question though is the us versus them right front

1227
01:47:23.20 --> 01:47:29.28
lines versus corporate headquarters and you've got to defeat that if you're a good leader you

1228
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:34.24
got to recognize look we're all the same team we can't do what we need to do without having the

1229
01:47:34.24 --> 01:47:41.76
support and you know the resources and the approvals a plans from the corporate headquarters you know

1230
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:47.36
and corporate headquarters it oftentimes so not only are is there frustration up the chain there's

1231
01:47:47.36 --> 01:47:50.88
also frustration down the chain you hear that all the time like will the front lines it will

1232
01:47:50.88 --> 01:47:55.44
really get it they don't get it over there well listen from the front lines is where the actual

1233
01:47:55.44 --> 01:48:00.24
mission gets one lost yeah so you you've got to you might want to have them on board with the

1234
01:48:00.24 --> 01:48:04.08
big example so you got to make sure that you know that it's got to if you want to successful team

1235
01:48:04.08 --> 01:48:10.72
you you can't have us versus them ever to get on board for the big win yeah the full metal jacket

1236
01:48:10.72 --> 01:48:15.60
right what's your problem son once you get on board for the big win and and you think oh well

1237
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:19.20
if i'm the general and i'm telling this young guy that's got a peace sign on this helmet

1238
01:48:19.20 --> 01:48:24.40
that represents the dichotomy maybe that's where i learn the word dichotomy from that represents the

1239
01:48:24.40 --> 01:48:29.52
dichotomy of what does he say that dichotomy again he says the duality of duality of man yeah

1240
01:48:29.52 --> 01:48:34.24
you're right that represents the duality of man what did you take that thing off and get on board

1241
01:48:34.24 --> 01:48:39.04
for the big win and that's such a great line from that move join the team son get on board for the

1242
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:42.64
big win that's such a great line from that movie because that's exactly what we're talking about

1243
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:48.000
that does absolutely nothing for that front line soldier that goes okay you're saying that

1244
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.76
and i'm literally bearing people right now in this situation and so for you saying that to me means

1245
01:48:53.76 --> 01:48:58.64
nothing in fact it shows how completely freaking out a touch you are and so they did a great job

1246
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:03.12
in that movie of representing that through one single line it won't just get on board for the

1247
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:13.20
big win it's like no actually why don't you lead how does that sound so communicate up and down

1248
01:49:13.20 --> 01:49:19.76
jinnic man make sure people know why and tie in why it matters to them next question

1249
01:49:22.40 --> 01:49:27.68
in extreme ownership you talk about being close with the team but not so close that they forget

1250
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:34.64
who's in charge or that the good of the team suffers how do you overcome the isolation of leadership

1251
01:49:34.64 --> 01:49:44.88
what strategies did or do you employ to avoid the isolation becoming an issue this is an example

1252
01:49:44.88 --> 01:49:51.20
of i'm gonna take this to the extreme hey i'm not gonna be too close to my people guess what i'm

1253
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:55.68
not talking to them right i'm not gonna speak to them i'm gonna i'm gonna maintain a distance

1254
01:49:55.68 --> 01:50:00.000
i'm gonna and it's it's obviously not true it's obviously not true and i think you know

1255
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:07.60
the the relations that you and me and Seth and the that we all had was clearly uh this right

1256
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:13.28
i wasn't alone i wasn't isolated as the leader because we were all bros and hanging out and

1257
01:50:13.28 --> 01:50:17.92
now didn't start off like that no you know i as we always talk about like i come across a hack

1258
01:50:17.92 --> 01:50:21.84
worth style of like hey we're not gonna joke around for at least whatever six to eight weeks to make

1259
01:50:21.84 --> 01:50:28.000
sure that these dudes are good to go and that that they understand where i'm coming from and and

1260
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.96
that's cool but once we get through that okay like then it's like open up a little bit then it's like

1261
01:50:32.96 --> 01:50:36.32
open up a little bit more and then it's up a little bit more so that you're not isolated at the

1262
01:50:36.32 --> 01:50:41.44
top because not only is it important that you're not isolated that's like that's like a marginal thing

1263
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:48.24
what's more important is what i talked about earlier is if you if life can't come to me and say

1264
01:50:48.24 --> 01:50:53.84
hey man hey i don't agree with this plan or more importantly hey jockel here's what's going on

1265
01:50:53.84 --> 01:50:57.60
with the troops right now here's what's going on with the mentality here's what's going on with the

1266
01:50:57.60 --> 01:51:05.20
morale if he can't knock on my door and say that to me then that's a real problem because now um you

1267
01:51:05.20 --> 01:51:11.28
know i'm i'm in the dark on what's happening inside inside with the troops which is problematic

1268
01:51:12.56 --> 01:51:17.20
yeah i think it's this to me sounds like uh i was thinking about this question and

1269
01:51:17.20 --> 01:51:21.36
it sounds to me like uh maybe a junior leader that was promoted at the chain because that's where

1270
01:51:21.36 --> 01:51:24.96
you really feel like when i go from you know the assistant buto commander where i'm like kind of one

1271
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:30.80
of the boys and i'm you know where we can you know it's kind of uh i can kind of play interference

1272
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:35.52
with it with the officer and charge and the buto commander now so i get promoted it's you recognize

1273
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:39.92
instantly there's a little bit of difference you've got to maybe kind of distance yourself a slightly

1274
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:43.92
from where you were previously in recognized when you took over charlie buto and i was the

1275
01:51:43.92 --> 01:51:48.56
buto commander when did you realize you needed to transition from being one of the boys until

1276
01:51:48.56 --> 01:51:53.76
being the o i seen that there was that the gap was going to open up a little bit was it as soon as

1277
01:51:53.76 --> 01:51:58.72
you took over it was pretty quick because i've been to buds uh and uh seal qualification training

1278
01:51:58.72 --> 01:52:03.12
you know as future advanced training with uh with several guys uh and i knew these guys very well

1279
01:52:03.12 --> 01:52:08.16
and you know i think we had a big house party hanging out you know having a good time and and

1280
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:12.08
uh everybody's over at my house and all of a sudden I realized some i did all the time you know

1281
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:16.24
as an assistant to the new commander and all of a sudden uh we're in it work you know the next

1282
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:21.36
week and i got to uh make some some tough calls and we got to get you know drive the standards

1283
01:52:21.36 --> 01:52:26.08
a little bit higher where we're at and they're supposed back and you realize like okay when it's

1284
01:52:26.08 --> 01:52:29.52
when it's time to give some people some bad news or say hey we're not doing as good as we should

1285
01:52:29.52 --> 01:52:34.16
we need to fix that and they kind of give you the leg hey bro you know what are you doing

1286
01:52:34.16 --> 01:52:37.76
Friday you know like then it's then you're like okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to distance

1287
01:52:37.76 --> 01:52:43.20
a little bit but the the isolation you should never be isolated i think that's one thing that

1288
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:48.24
you know i remember coming into your office and uh i'm coming in hang out all the time in your

1289
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:52.88
office you know you you you come in hang out in the between space i mean i've come you know we

1290
01:52:52.88 --> 01:52:57.12
we'd see each other in the gym we're like we're always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk

1291
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:02.56
and and um it was even even when you know Seth's known was all we're across the the other side of

1292
01:53:02.56 --> 01:53:05.76
the city i mean you know we'd still connect with him and talk to him with the phone and what's

1293
01:53:05.76 --> 01:53:12.24
well yeah well i talked about time on the uh and dvt yeah you guys you guys talk right

1294
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:16.32
but but haven't but even even you know yeah we'd always we he came by like we'd always

1295
01:53:16.32 --> 01:53:20.16
try to try to get together and talk to each other and catch up with us in the chow haul or

1296
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:25.60
our uh you know in in the between space and you know gas like i've ever told you would come

1297
01:53:25.60 --> 01:53:30.96
with our ad come in i'd walk in and i'd see the wind plan written up on chowco's whiteboard

1298
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:35.04
the task in it roser or Tony had written down all the things that we needed to do to wind and

1299
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:41.60
rabadi which were pretty harsh yes true but probably on the probably on the level like gangas

1300
01:53:41.60 --> 01:53:46.48
common certainly had a great news that gangas common wind plan which you know what hey man but

1301
01:53:46.48 --> 01:53:50.24
we are as it's marron we are we are joking laughing about that this is the relationship juggle had

1302
01:53:50.24 --> 01:53:54.64
you know not only with me but with with with other leaders in the task unit and uh and i think you

1303
01:53:54.64 --> 01:53:58.32
have to have that i mean you you've got to have a you've got to have a relationship with your people

1304
01:53:58.32 --> 01:54:02.40
um you can't think that i can't talk to anyone i can't interact with anyone i think this you're

1305
01:54:02.40 --> 01:54:07.44
gonna be unsuccessful leader um you know if if uh you try to roll that way it's just not gonna

1306
01:54:07.44 --> 01:54:13.44
work yeah i think where you might feel what might feel like a isolation which is definitely true

1307
01:54:13.44 --> 01:54:18.40
and this is the burden of command right like guess what you your friends with life your friends

1308
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:23.76
with Seth your friends with Tony your friends with these guys but at the same time like oh the burden

1309
01:54:23.76 --> 01:54:30.16
of command is on you and it's gonna be it's gonna be you you're gonna you're gonna bear that right

1310
01:54:30.16 --> 01:54:33.52
in your cartoon it's like hey you got your assistant to two commands you got your

1311
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:40.32
patron chief you got your LPO but when something goes wrong if something goes wrong if you

1312
01:54:41.12 --> 01:54:45.84
if there's a bat if something happens on a mission it goes bad i'm not talking i'm not i'm not

1313
01:54:45.84 --> 01:54:51.52
looking at the assistant platoon commander i'm i'm looking at you that's the burden of command that's

1314
01:54:51.52 --> 01:54:56.08
so that thing yeah that's the there's one man that stands on the carpet right that's that's the

1315
01:54:56.08 --> 01:55:01.28
way it works and sometimes being one man that's that's a little bit of a nice lady feeling

1316
01:55:01.28 --> 01:55:06.16
and to help help you understand our leading petty officer charlotte batoon awesome awesome amazing

1317
01:55:06.16 --> 01:55:10.72
CEO love the guy and uh help he could be on here one of these days but after the debut

1318
01:55:10.72 --> 01:55:17.36
year is retirement comes one one of these days but uh he was i'm at we were we were up in

1319
01:55:17.36 --> 01:55:26.32
navaa training and uh we took a couple days to go snowboarding which was an awesome good deal and

1320
01:55:26.32 --> 01:55:31.68
he like we're in the vanny looks around he like sees me he's like i'm not the senior guy in charge

1321
01:55:32.96 --> 01:55:37.04
and uh so he's screaming a laugh and about how awesome it is to nong be the senior guy because he

1322
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:42.000
knows the burden of command is now with me and now with him if uh guys get trouble or do something

1323
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.80
we should have done yeah yeah which is while you're in toho guys getting in trouble and doing

1324
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:55.20
stuff stupid it's probably a fairly likely thing to have at highly valuable that's one of my

1325
01:55:55.20 --> 01:56:01.28
favorite trips that I did multiple times yeah so that's it man build relationships and at the same

1326
01:56:01.28 --> 01:56:06.08
time you are when you're in charge you're in charge and there's a little bit of uh that's called

1327
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:17.04
the burner command embrace it and we got time for one more question here you go in life and

1328
01:56:17.04 --> 01:56:22.16
jocos opinion you've been excluded from this one echo troughs they don't want your opinion

1329
01:56:24.32 --> 01:56:32.16
what has changed or what point do you find you need to emphasize more from when you wrote

1330
01:56:32.16 --> 01:56:37.68
extreme ownership to now well this is a softball question that I selected he said all the

1331
01:56:37.68 --> 01:56:42.56
easy ones well yeah I think the answer to this one's pretty obvious that's why we wrote the book

1332
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:49.68
that kind of a leadership I mean this is uh this is what we had needed to emphasize more and just as

1333
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:54.08
you know you talked about this when we were talking about jaws to you know whether now you know the

1334
01:56:54.08 --> 01:56:57.92
sequel is gonna be as good and you know we had we had pressured a right a book he's trying

1335
01:56:57.92 --> 01:57:02.40
to be very well like hey guys you're right in the book we didn't want to write in the book until we

1336
01:57:02.40 --> 01:57:07.20
actually had something useful to write about that would impact leaders for the better help them be

1337
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:12.56
better people better leaders lead better teams lead better lives and and that's what this is type

1338
01:57:12.56 --> 01:57:17.76
the decadent leadership answers uh the most difficult challenges and and obstacles that we see

1339
01:57:17.76 --> 01:57:23.04
leaders face and I think that three years you know one thing that is your motion did for us is

1340
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:28.32
I mean our company blew up as a result echelon front we were able to work with so many more leaders and

1341
01:57:28.32 --> 01:57:34.08
so many more companies and we got to see this over and over and over and over and over again and

1342
01:57:34.08 --> 01:57:40.56
and this uh this is capturing those those issues uh that that we saw uh and then the solutions

1343
01:57:40.56 --> 01:57:45.12
to solve most problems to leadership yeah I think it's gonna be pretty evident I think it was cool

1344
01:57:45.12 --> 01:57:52.96
how it revealed itself as the subject matter of the next book I mean we we like you

1345
01:57:52.96 --> 01:57:58.24
said business blew up yes we were busy we weren't really sitting there going okay watch the next

1346
01:57:58.24 --> 01:58:03.44
book we read about watch the next book be about we actually we didn't even think of we weren't

1347
01:58:03.44 --> 01:58:09.92
even thinking about it and then as we started saying you know people don't understand this as well

1348
01:58:09.92 --> 01:58:16.80
hey we we should have added more chapters about the dichotomy we and it's like over time all

1349
01:58:16.80 --> 01:58:22.72
of us on it became very it became completely blatantly obvious that what people needed help with

1350
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:29.60
was this most difficult thing which is achieving the balance of all the different dichotomies

1351
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:36.80
of leadership and that's why we wrote the dichotomy leadership gets on right on well or

1352
01:58:36.80 --> 01:58:42.40
just hitting that two hour mark which means we only have two hours for echo to talk about support

1353
01:58:42.40 --> 01:58:50.24
you said echo was a school for that last question but I want to know what your answer is echo

1354
01:58:50.24 --> 01:58:55.84
from uh oh yeah what you've learned since extreme ownership comes out since the podcast is launched

1355
01:58:55.84 --> 01:59:02.88
okay so the the main thing that sticks out main thing is that is what people seem to ask you all

1356
01:59:02.88 --> 01:59:07.36
the time is what do I do when other people aren't taking extreme ownership and here's thing when

1357
01:59:07.36 --> 01:59:11.36
you're outside and listening you're like a high see what you know it's almost like a funny

1358
01:59:11.36 --> 01:59:15.60
question right because like what what do you call that like ironic right kind of or they're like what

1359
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:20.40
do you do when other people but it's you the one supposed to you know so that's it but the reason

1360
01:59:20.40 --> 01:59:25.12
that that significant is because when you're in the situation that's exactly what it feels like you

1361
01:59:25.12 --> 01:59:31.20
can't like really see it seems to me so you got a detach which kind of kind of shed more even more

1362
01:59:31.20 --> 01:59:38.96
light on the uh the importance of detaching right so it kind of feeds into itself but so yeah when

1363
01:59:38.96 --> 01:59:45.36
you're in the situation and you have to essentially take ownership when the other person should

1364
01:59:45.36 --> 01:59:50.000
be taking ownership but actually in your mind the other person hey you need to take responsibility

1365
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.36
for this that's the time you gotta take responsibility of it yeah it's hard to like it's hard to

1366
01:59:55.36 --> 01:59:59.60
really grasp that in the beginning I thought well that was pretty cool recently we got an email

1367
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:07.12
from a guy that's overseas running a company and he he listened to Dave Burke and and Neil did

1368
02:00:07.12 --> 02:00:12.16
yeah good deal Dave and I think it's a great example to say can you take ownership of the weather

1369
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:15.36
right because the obvious answer is no I can't take ownership of the weather and I talk about this

1370
02:00:15.36 --> 02:00:19.36
on that podcast is like well actually you can yeah because you can come over contingency plans you can

1371
02:00:19.36 --> 02:00:25.44
come up with you can stage your force forward closer and so anyways this guy in his company

1372
02:00:25.44 --> 02:00:31.84
it's a software type company and implementation company and they piggyback on a big giant you know

1373
02:00:31.84 --> 02:00:37.04
one of the biggest companies in the world and that biggest company in the world one of the biggest

1374
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:44.40
companies in the world made some errors and it messed up their platform and they went to their

1375
02:00:44.40 --> 02:00:50.40
clients and hey the platform got messed up it was the big guys they did this this and this wrong

1376
02:00:50.40 --> 02:00:57.12
and the people were like oh well okay you know I guess and then he went home and he listened to

1377
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:03.52
that podcast and he went I screwed up because that's hey the biggest company in the world is still

1378
02:01:03.52 --> 02:01:10.08
easier to control than the weather right and so he went back to the company and he went back to the

1379
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:15.84
his client and said you know what it wasn't their fault it was our fault it was my fault

1380
02:01:15.84 --> 02:01:21.36
here's some things I'm gonna put in place so that this never happens again and all of a sudden

1381
02:01:21.36 --> 02:01:26.80
the attitude completely changes and the client is super happy and is all of his team also because

1382
02:01:26.80 --> 02:01:30.16
what does that do to your team when you blame when you blame the weather your team just goes okay

1383
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:35.04
we got a permanent excuse now whether wasn't good c's were too big when was too high cloud

1384
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:38.72
cover was too low whatever the case maybe you got a permanent excuse now because you can't control

1385
02:01:38.72 --> 02:01:45.68
the weather actually wrong wrong we they control the weather we we will set up our missions we will

1386
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:49.76
set up our contingencies that no matter what the weather does where you do a conference the mission

1387
02:01:49.76 --> 02:01:54.96
no matter what our big whatever wouldn't no matter what the big platform that we rely on no matter

1388
02:01:54.96 --> 02:01:59.84
what happens with them we're gonna be in control that's how we roll get some that feedback was

1389
02:01:59.84 --> 02:02:03.60
phenomenal and here you know saying that his client was like I've never seen anyone handle a

1390
02:02:03.60 --> 02:02:07.60
problem I guess before you guys have done an amazing job and it's it's another example of how

1391
02:02:08.56 --> 02:02:13.76
you're you're scared to take ownership and yet by taking ownership you're building trust

1392
02:02:13.76 --> 02:02:17.84
you're building trust and you win it when when you take ownership and you actually get the problem

1393
02:02:17.84 --> 02:02:25.52
solve going for speaking of ownership and taking ownership maybe I could take ownership but you know

1394
02:02:25.52 --> 02:02:34.000
support sure be happy to how to support you know people's selves sells the path really that's what

1395
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.44
we're supporting the path right right on the path you're on the path all right if you're not on the path

1396
02:02:39.44 --> 02:02:45.52
I'm well actually somebody requested a picture of just a sign that said please stay on the path yeah that's

1397
02:02:45.52 --> 02:02:52.24
good yeah yeah exactly right and I was gonna say if you're not on the path we're not talking to you but if you're not on the path

1398
02:02:52.24 --> 02:02:59.44
I'm I think we're talking to equally maybe more so I want to say more so but really if you're on the path

1399
02:02:59.44 --> 02:03:04.16
when I'm talking to you super loud too so each I think I don't know maybe we'll think about that

1400
02:03:04.16 --> 02:03:15.84
more later we'll go into origin right our company origin main dot com geese rash guard for

1401
02:03:15.84 --> 02:03:21.60
jujitsu lathe talked about jujitsu earlier awesome stuff yeah origin makes the best stuff it's uh

1402
02:03:21.60 --> 02:03:28.40
I've got I think I have like five different you you have the first origin guy I ever

1403
02:03:28.40 --> 02:03:34.72
touched was yours I never echo you as well yeah interesting and I was like dang yeah it was

1404
02:03:34.72 --> 02:03:41.52
it was it the mustard and yeah and the real when you see the weave like on the origin geese they're pattern

1405
02:03:41.52 --> 02:03:46.40
there you can understand you're gonna get so do you have do you have currently do you have any

1406
02:03:46.40 --> 02:03:51.76
other geese that are not origin I have three geese I have one non origin geese okay two origin

1407
02:03:51.76 --> 02:03:58.08
go put that on took put that on and and he says like is a threat put that on see what happens

1408
02:03:58.08 --> 02:04:02.08
boy you would have an emserious could I put on mine I was like oh should I keep this or

1409
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:06.32
no I put on you know one of my old house like bro I can't I can't wear this like it doesn't

1410
02:04:06.32 --> 02:04:12.80
it's not great don't it those geese I even even at the at the white belt level I can totally tell

1411
02:04:12.80 --> 02:04:17.68
that I roll better in my origin geese oh yes that's that's a whole button well I said that's

1412
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:22.24
what they felt good he's rolling bad I'm telling you no but there's someone about like the it

1413
02:04:22.24 --> 02:04:27.84
it actually has give to my shoulders I can move in a way that like I with my other geese it's

1414
02:04:27.84 --> 02:04:32.72
it's really tight I can't move and I feel like I don't I actually I seem to be more

1415
02:04:32.72 --> 02:04:38.08
personal and what percentage of increased performance do you achieve wearing an origin

1416
02:04:38.08 --> 02:04:43.92
at least 9% at least thank you no good I actually that is a good point because I had a geese

1417
02:04:43.92 --> 02:04:47.92
like my second geese ever and I was like hey that one looks cool because it had like cool designs

1418
02:04:47.92 --> 02:04:51.92
on it or whatever and it was like thick material for some reason I thought that beefy thick

1419
02:04:51.92 --> 02:04:58.56
material look cool so I got it and it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna name the name of the brand

1420
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:03.92
so doesn't matter but um yeah when I'm rolling it it feels like more claustrophobic like with

1421
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:08.96
which we know you have an issue with like did before yeah back in the old days yeah did I

1422
02:05:08.96 --> 02:05:13.28
carry you across the fact I think you were a country that took you to the cure of my class I was rolling

1423
02:05:13.28 --> 02:05:18.96
Andy and we were on with the geese and I was trying to do like a crazy whatever

1424
02:05:20.40 --> 02:05:25.44
lapel not lapel what's the what's the down here like the bottom part of the jacket yeah this is

1425
02:05:25.44 --> 02:05:30.64
so I had Andy and I was trying I was almost just working something and I couldn't I didn't have

1426
02:05:30.64 --> 02:05:37.68
enough jacket out and I was like I was pratoon like I'm an average and make you a thing for you

1427
02:05:37.68 --> 02:05:42.08
but it was the where for him to wear him to wear him to wear a ball with yes exactly and then he was

1428
02:05:42.08 --> 02:05:46.80
doing you know how people drag your jacket and they get between your leg on a single you know what I mean

1429
02:05:46.80 --> 02:05:53.12
just and he's doing he's like that's his game right now and I told him I'm gonna make I have

1430
02:05:53.12 --> 02:05:57.92
origin make a geek from the fence corner so you can grab it so we're gonna rest Taylor tier we

1431
02:05:57.92 --> 02:06:02.56
gotta do it but that makes sense though if you roll better like if you're feeling like you're

1432
02:06:02.56 --> 02:06:06.32
kind of straight check I'm not saying other brands feel like straight check I'm not saying that but I'm

1433
02:06:06.32 --> 02:06:11.36
saying if you have a specific feeling while you're rolling and it's impulsively you're

1434
02:06:11.36 --> 02:06:15.92
the fit of it makes all the troops from it and if you forget like it's not very flexible it's

1435
02:06:15.92 --> 02:06:20.32
it's awesome and it definitely improves your game and it helps you and you look good by the way

1436
02:06:20.32 --> 02:06:26.40
said no also speaking of looking good and feeling good and comfort they do have joggers and

1437
02:06:26.40 --> 02:06:31.84
t-shirts and whatnot most comfortable joggers still today in my experience which is means a lot

1438
02:06:31.84 --> 02:06:36.40
are you getting jogger to wear this jogger? I think joggers yeah even though this is going to be the

1439
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:43.60
undisputed champion of comfort according to kind of sorry and and rash guards I wear I wear

1440
02:06:44.32 --> 02:06:49.68
the rash guard when I'm working out some days the days I wear it when I'm working out it's long

1441
02:06:49.68 --> 02:06:54.000
sleeve is when I'm doing a lot of stuff on the rings so my arms don't get all chafed up which is a

1442
02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:01.68
comfort move if you break it down just saying yeah well let me finish that let's say the results

1443
02:07:01.68 --> 02:07:07.76
of not having the rash guard imp or impedes or gets in the way of your functionality or something

1444
02:07:07.76 --> 02:07:13.28
like this you know you know how like like some people who wear straps or they'll wear

1445
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:20.16
I don't know what it oh like some of the 10 of full power lifting suit yeah yeah yeah like

1446
02:07:20.16 --> 02:07:26.16
full thing yeah but that's more of like in it I don't know it's someone else has to put your belt on

1447
02:07:26.16 --> 02:07:30.16
you you know what I'm saying when you're like heaving there's two or three people trying to

1448
02:07:30.16 --> 02:07:34.56
heav the belt in a position yeah yeah I guess no I'm thinking more because like

1449
02:07:34.56 --> 02:07:39.12
compare that to your rash guard scenario right it's like something something that's going to like

1450
02:07:39.84 --> 02:07:43.60
you know people wear those things on their hands so they don't get blisters right so the blisters

1451
02:07:43.60 --> 02:07:48.80
sure you could power through it but if it was measurable what it get in the way of the performance

1452
02:07:48.80 --> 02:07:54.40
the blister if you do rip a call us which sometimes people post rip call us and and I get it like

1453
02:07:54.40 --> 02:07:58.08
you got a good workout in but guess what your tomorrow's workout is not going to be as good

1454
02:07:58.08 --> 02:08:01.84
especially if you think tomorrow the dead list with the rip call us from pull ups

1455
02:08:01.84 --> 02:08:06.16
it's a bad thing you need to go back for some may it's a make sure you don't let this

1456
02:08:06.16 --> 02:08:11.84
call us it's a good question is I'm stoked you got after it but I'm not stoked in the next

1457
02:08:11.84 --> 02:08:16.80
day when you're like not being able to yeah so let's say they work gloves or in your case you

1458
02:08:16.80 --> 02:08:22.16
wear the rash guards is that technically for comfort or is it for you know if you're a state

1459
02:08:22.16 --> 02:08:28.48
functionality yeah yeah yeah I don't I don't know if I could see fit to say that I've witnessed you

1460
02:08:28.48 --> 02:08:35.92
do anything for comfort as far as getting after it goes okay let's go on yeah keep note yeah

1461
02:08:35.92 --> 02:08:40.56
we'll keep looking for now and also what supplements the jacquoise supplements jacquoise

1462
02:08:40.56 --> 02:08:47.60
let's up let's see we got joint warfare we got acrylic oil we got discipline

1463
02:08:47.60 --> 02:08:53.44
joint warfare and krill oils for your joints and now surprisingly alternate fact

1464
02:08:56.56 --> 02:09:03.20
curcumin is also good for your brain function apparently which I could use all the help I can get

1465
02:09:04.48 --> 02:09:10.24
you sure I just I just got an order in a new new replacement order in for some krill oil

1466
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:15.44
and join warfers yeah wait you're on the discipline trainer now I'm on the discipline train

1467
02:09:15.44 --> 02:09:19.68
I get it this moment I see you got some discipline right at this moment unfortunately I lost

1468
02:09:19.68 --> 02:09:24.96
discipline earlier yeah do this is weird lack of discipline yeah yeah like he he he he made

1469
02:09:24.96 --> 02:09:29.52
discipline and then he lost his discipline I mixed up a huge bottle of discipline of jacquoise house

1470
02:09:29.52 --> 02:09:33.92
and then as we were leaving the come here I'm like what the hell did I do with it I was like

1471
02:09:33.92 --> 02:09:38.56
wait where is your discipline I think your dog is probably getting after it now just like

1472
02:09:38.56 --> 02:09:44.88
a level 19 but you got a back though I see so that's good yeah mulk can't forget about the mulk

1473
02:09:46.16 --> 02:09:50.96
which is the tastiest of all tasties best so this is comfort so you this is a comfort yeah

1474
02:09:50.96 --> 02:09:56.000
yes it's a good is true and I'll be honest with you now maybe I burn myself out of meant

1475
02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.36
but I've been going I've been going Richter on TV yeah and then I haven't tried these yet I

1476
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:04.56
will only have I've got metchak with jacquoise yet that I will go get some out of your

1477
02:10:04.56 --> 02:10:09.28
bit so that you're okay so the chocolate or the peanut butter chocolate comes in right

1478
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:13.28
oh big hype we're talking about it when's it coming it's supposed to come in this one week

1479
02:10:13.28 --> 02:10:17.44
it took what if you days later whatever big hype comes in everyone's fired up I'm one of those people

1480
02:10:18.16 --> 02:10:23.52
so I'm like boom so I'm pounding uh chocolate peanut butter now pounding it mulk train full

1481
02:10:23.52 --> 02:10:29.76
speed double mulk train it so after a while I'm pounding the peanut butter you know one and

1482
02:10:29.76 --> 02:10:35.12
then I look and I still have that mint one one day I go in I'm gonna make it I see the mint one

1483
02:10:35.12 --> 02:10:38.96
and the mint one it looked like it was looking at me like what did you forget about me you know like

1484
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:45.20
I was cheating on the mint like I'd left the mint you know so I put the mint one back in and

1485
02:10:45.20 --> 02:10:54.48
I was reminded that that is my favorite one yeah yeah I but they taste good yeah see it's kind of like

1486
02:10:54.48 --> 02:11:01.12
it's kind of like um it's it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous that you can just completely eat that

1487
02:11:01.12 --> 02:11:06.48
and just enjoy it yeah my son has been posted I've been re-threading it someone's been posting like

1488
02:11:06.48 --> 02:11:12.40
mulk recipes oh yeah and it are all these different ideas I haven't tried any of them yet because

1489
02:11:12.40 --> 02:11:17.44
I just that's not my thing what do we just put it straight in milk oh no I just put it milk but this

1490
02:11:17.44 --> 02:11:25.20
guy is creating like like cookies ball cookies all kinds of crazy mulk conventions and they look good

1491
02:11:25.20 --> 02:11:31.20
and he's saying they taste good so I don't know I'll give him a try what you do is or what I

1492
02:11:31.20 --> 02:11:38.16
wound up doing is because peanut butter is like in my opinion undiable thing in life peanut butter

1493
02:11:38.16 --> 02:11:44.32
the flavor so the mint chocolate does so I put the peanut butter it's actual peanut butter

1494
02:11:44.32 --> 02:11:48.48
sometimes you can mix one scoop one scoop you know peanut butter chocolate and the mint chocolate

1495
02:11:48.48 --> 02:11:53.36
cool but you've done that oh yeah I'm not all dead that's like crossing the streams and ghost

1496
02:11:53.36 --> 02:11:58.000
busters oh yeah and you know that's how they want the movie that's how they defeated the bed

1497
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.72
that they crosses street so yeah the cream shall stand out of there she do is you put

1498
02:12:05.52 --> 02:12:12.80
peanut butter with the milk one that's do that report back okay if you want hey would at this time

jocco has a store it's called jocco store and this is where you can get a peril a peril school right

1502
02:12:34.32 --> 02:12:39.92
yeah fashion is not not cool okay we're in a fashion okay cool a peril but if you want to

1503
02:12:39.92 --> 02:12:46.08

1504
02:12:46.08 --> 02:12:51.68
accept the term national jocco doesn't it yeah oh good you look good though I think I don't know

1505
02:12:51.68 --> 02:12:55.60
that's a matter of opinion but if you want to represent that's where you can get shirts rash cards

1506
02:12:56.40 --> 02:13:06.24
hats joccer hats namely joccer hat or flex fit where you at joccer hat see there you go dang

1507
02:13:06.24 --> 02:13:10.88
when the flex fit oh yeah interesting I'm not against it I'm not gonna report back

1508
02:13:11.52 --> 02:13:18.48
I want to know what sells more trucker hat or or flex fit that's an interesting question

1509
02:13:18.48 --> 02:13:24.96
I'll find out what you're doing on that and also got a long comment about hoodies a guy from

1510
02:13:24.96 --> 02:13:32.80
Michigan that works construction said hey jocco just let you know in Michigan we do need

1511
02:13:32.80 --> 02:13:39.12
like wait hoodies oh boom so now I can look everything I've ever said has been disproven now this is

1512
02:13:39.12 --> 02:13:44.48
one man's opinion yes you know well here's the thing about that when you kind of did take a

1513
02:13:44.48 --> 02:13:49.12
step back it's like you you just went extreme you weren't wrong you just went extreme that's all

1514
02:13:49.12 --> 02:13:56.72
you know you don't have to do the balance so this guy in Michigan he had the balance because he

1515
02:13:56.72 --> 02:14:00.88
knows the extreme he knows about the value of the thing who he's in Michigan I gotta say for the

1516
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:04.56
folks in Michigan though like being up there in North Dakota doing to work like when you go to

1517
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:09.12
Alaska and you you know it's like pretty cool out and you got your jacket on he's looking

1518
02:14:09.12 --> 02:14:13.68
on there's dudes like T-shirts just hanging out that's where it was it's all relative yeah so

1519
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:18.64
here's like two like in Maine just where I just where I have he sweatshirt all day long I mean

1520
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:23.28
all winter long maybe I've occasionally got to throw on some kind of a parka and you know what a

1521
02:14:23.28 --> 02:14:29.04
park is being from Hawaii not sounds yeah so what you do with your car right on the

1522
02:14:29.04 --> 02:14:34.32
Chalker hat flex foot debate out like flex foot I think is great I like flex flex foot hats

1523
02:14:34.32 --> 02:14:41.12
but I will say I got a large melon and being able to adjust is important no particularly when

1524
02:14:41.12 --> 02:14:45.36
you're fishing and you're rolling out and your hat gets blown off and it's then it's so

1525
02:14:45.36 --> 02:14:51.52
can what are they like the largest melon I've ever seen on a human there was a guy on the special

1526
02:14:51.52 --> 02:14:59.44
boat teams who was a great dude he was a big I'll just say Polynesian maybe he was Filipino maybe

1527
02:14:59.44 --> 02:15:03.52
he was Polynesian I don't know but he was something like that right Pacific Islander I guess

1528
02:15:04.48 --> 02:15:09.52
he's head was so big okay you know a protect helmet you know a protect helmet it's a

1529
02:15:09.52 --> 02:15:15.36
protect bike helmet he had one of those for for riding in the boat for like doing operations where

1530
02:15:15.36 --> 02:15:23.28
you got to wear helmet he had one of those and he had all the foam inside of it all of it was gone

1531
02:15:23.84 --> 02:15:29.20
and we still had to like basically grease up his head get that thing on this and it would be

1532
02:15:29.20 --> 02:15:34.88
it was crazy how big his head was huge and he was a great dude but he had a huge head

1533
02:15:34.88 --> 02:15:38.64
he had no protection he just had a little thin he only wore that thing because it was a part of

1534
02:15:38.64 --> 02:15:42.72
the rules right Pacific Islander yeah he could have just called he could have looked I don't need

1535
02:15:42.72 --> 02:15:48.80
to helmet my freaking head helmet knife into thick get away from me I get away from the stupid

1536
02:15:48.80 --> 02:15:54.40
helmet on people all right so he would need the flex fit you know a lot of flex in that fit

1537
02:15:54.40 --> 02:15:58.72
he need a lot of flex in that fit I don't think the truck would fit nonetheless anyway like I said

1538
02:15:58.72 --> 02:16:04.24
jockel store dot com so we can get all this cool my opinion cool stuff so when you made a

1539
02:16:04.24 --> 02:16:10.16
lot of stuff too new stuff is on there yeah jockel white tea there's a shirt so my brother has a

1540
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:16.24
Pepsi shirt and a garbage or a garbage pale kids yes you know the little cards they're like so

1541
02:16:17.52 --> 02:16:25.20
my twin brother jay he has a garbage pale kid shirt and you'd think as an adult you're like all right

1542
02:16:25.20 --> 02:16:31.52
but it kind of you know it's kind of cool it's cool shirt and then you get it your Pepsi shirt like

1543
02:16:31.52 --> 02:16:35.52
even if you don't drink pepper it just looks cool right so we got a jockel white tea shirt

1544
02:16:35.52 --> 02:16:41.12
so that was not I thought I actually gave you credit in my mind for having an original cool

1545
02:16:41.12 --> 02:16:44.48
because I thought I didn't think it look pretty cool it's yeah and the thing is it does the

1546
02:16:44.48 --> 02:16:49.20
the fact is that concept is a very cool concept I didn't do it because hey Pepsi do it so let's do it

1547
02:16:49.20 --> 02:16:53.52
that's not why I did it let's think that that that concept is cool right oh you don't jockel white

1548
02:16:53.52 --> 02:17:00.24
tea let me get the shirt and it's a tea shirt we call those layers anyway yes some new stuff on there

1549
02:17:00.24 --> 02:17:08.40
oh check out check also good way to support is to subscribe to the podcast if you have

1550
02:17:08.40 --> 02:17:14.08
an already on iTunes Google Play Stitcher you know wherever you where you listen to your podcast

1551
02:17:14.08 --> 02:17:19.20
just subscribe that's a good way to support leave a review and you know you want your kids to listen

1552
02:17:19.20 --> 02:17:24.08
to this podcast but you know you can't because sometimes it's completely inappropriate but for that

1553
02:17:24.08 --> 02:17:30.000
reason we have the warrior kid podcast and that's questions from Uncle Jake or for Uncle Jake

1554
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:37.20
and so you can get that one to the YouTube we also have a YouTube channel that you can subscribe to

1555
02:17:37.20 --> 02:17:41.68
hey subscribe you know what let's not do this you never watch a YouTube video and they

1556
02:17:41.68 --> 02:17:46.08
end at the end it goes please subscribe and click whatever right click we're not going to do that

1557
02:17:46.08 --> 02:17:50.08
yeah we're not going to do that when you think about it and I don't want to go into a whole

1558
02:17:50.08 --> 02:17:56.96
deep thing here but it seems like as a consumer right that's it is an audience member of

1559
02:17:56.96 --> 02:18:02.96
you or a video is whatever you and it does defeat the whole purpose of clicking like right when you

1560
02:18:02.96 --> 02:18:06.88
like let me ask you how many people do you think get the end of a YouTube video or it says click

1561
02:18:06.88 --> 02:18:10.96
subscribe now to watch more awesome videos how many people does that convince push them over the

1562
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:17.68
edge and they just can't stop that I don't know but from what I've read before it's like they

1563
02:18:17.68 --> 02:18:23.36
recommend that like that you do that as a content creator is what they call it they say yeah

1564
02:18:23.36 --> 02:18:27.36
hey just ask because people do it kind of thing it's kind of like hey you can't get it if you don't

1565
02:18:27.36 --> 02:18:33.68
ask but it does kind of give you this kind of underlying feeling of like you're asking me to do

1566
02:18:33.68 --> 02:18:39.36
something that's made to be organic it's made to be if you like this video you press like that's

1567
02:18:39.36 --> 02:18:44.72
what that thing is made for and now you're asking me to violate that whole reason that it's made

1568
02:18:44.72 --> 02:18:49.92
so you want me to do it like favor like you like I was watching your video because I thought we were

1569
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:55.04
just cool I thought we were just having a little moment right a little two minute and 30 second

1570
02:18:55.04 --> 02:18:59.36
moments and then I get to the end of it and now you're coming out saying that I need to do this to

1571
02:18:59.36 --> 02:19:05.92
do that this was now I see what it was it was a setup and I'm not saying that's what people are

1572
02:19:05.92 --> 02:19:10.24
doing I'm not saying that's what you're doing if you're doing that I'm just saying as a consumer

1573
02:19:10.24 --> 02:19:15.60
or as a viewer that's what it kind of feels like well we'll try to avoid that try to do it by just

1574
02:19:15.60 --> 02:19:20.24
saying hey on this podcast go there and subscribe to it that way you won't get bothered with a little

1575
02:19:20.24 --> 02:19:25.04
thing from echo at the end that says please click subscribe to watch more videos from echo

1576
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:30.72
child i still hear let's put it this way the most the most i'll show you say accurate for like a

1577
02:19:30.72 --> 02:19:39.36
better term way to put it if you didn't know that we have a youtube channel we do if you didn't know

1578
02:19:39.36 --> 02:19:45.20
you could subscribe to it boom now you do if you want to subscribe you can but that goes without saying

1579
02:19:45.20 --> 02:19:52.48
obviously same thing with the like i like it that's a youtube that's you too grab to it yeah

1580
02:19:52.48 --> 02:19:59.04
true also if you're working out you want to switch it up and talk about on it so on it dot com slash

1585
02:20:21.36 --> 02:20:26.72
tracks we're working on number two right now so we'll make that happen and i'm getting some good

1586
02:20:26.72 --> 02:20:35.44
requests via the interwebs about what should be on there so iTunes Google Play MP3 platforms you can

1587
02:20:35.44 --> 02:20:43.12
get that psychological warfare album with tracks but what is that for them we're not going to let

1588
02:20:43.12 --> 02:20:46.80
you say it everybody knows what it's for what's it for don't you know what it's for yes it

1589
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:51.28
knows what it's for it's to combat those moments of weakness that we all have i'm going to make a

1590
02:20:51.28 --> 02:20:59.12
cycle of track about how to not say something that has been said what do you do yeah some

1591
02:20:59.12 --> 02:21:04.96
of course that's something that's not been said yeah beat a dead horse yeah i'm just saying if they if this is the first time they

1592
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:08.48
they heard it they're going to be like what is that psychological warfare i know what regular

1593
02:21:08.48 --> 02:21:13.44
the traditional psychological warfare is it's kind of like if i kept saying hey jockel white

1594
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:17.44
tea oh you know what you can you can deadlift 8000 pounds and i kept saying that over and over again

1595
02:21:17.84 --> 02:21:21.68
and never stop saying it that'd be kind of like what you're doing yeah but so it seems like it

1596
02:21:21.68 --> 02:21:27.12
from your perspective but from the perspective someone just tuning in not just turning it over 130

1597
02:21:27.12 --> 02:21:31.20
podcasts the here's the thing they started where if they did they'll go listen to another one they'll

1598
02:21:31.20 --> 02:21:35.20
hear it eventually though and then they'll start to hear it over and over again but for i'm saying

1599
02:21:35.20 --> 02:21:42.24
as an individual count which means more in my opinion okay i think it'll be said all the match yeah that's

1600
02:21:42.24 --> 02:21:49.60
right now no we're getting that's it i like it don't get the amazons cans you can get cans people

1601
02:21:49.60 --> 02:21:55.92
don't know this you can get cans of jockel white tea it's stop drinking other energy drinks that are

1602
02:21:55.92 --> 02:22:00.40
filled with sugar and other crap and get yourself jockel white tea this so you know how there's

1603
02:22:00.40 --> 02:22:05.52
these pre-workouts yeah right you know pre-workout uh thing is right it's like super like it's

1604
02:22:06.16 --> 02:22:12.88
i don't know a pre-workout sorry but i know a pre-workout sorry you know what i'm talking about right

1605
02:22:12.88 --> 02:22:18.88
the one they have like a bunch of caffeine whatever the label is real shiny a lot of the time

1606
02:22:18.88 --> 02:22:21.92
you know what i'm talking about oh you know what you mean with ones that have a light label that's really

1607
02:22:21.92 --> 02:22:26.96
shite yeah i never got a light label but i don't know a lot of that yeah all right so let me ask you this

1608
02:22:28.32 --> 02:22:32.96
if i have a jockel white tea in a can yeah it's cold yeah right very refreshing

1609
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.44
and then i put some of that energy uh pre-workout in it since it doesn't have that much caffeine

1610
02:22:39.44 --> 02:22:44.48
and i was maybe looking for some caffeine if i put that pre-workout stuff in the in the jockel white tea

1611
02:22:45.36 --> 02:22:49.68
how much of a violation is that on a skill from one to ten i don't think it's a violation but

1612
02:22:49.68 --> 02:22:54.000
i would just use discipline you can put discipline in jockel white tea but that's just another

1613
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.20
micro dose of caffeine though i don't want caffeine but i would record right oi tea that's the thing

1614
02:22:59.20 --> 02:23:04.000
sure there's tastes got jammed up there's 60 milligrams of caffeine in jockel white tea can't

1615
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:09.84
that's that's enough let's say hypothetically again hypothetically one was looking for more than

1616
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:21.04
60 milligrams get get Greek fire okay so you know Greek fire us yeah or Greek fire from origin

1617
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:28.80
which has caffeine in it it's like a it's like a fat burner right so if you get that that's just

1618
02:23:28.80 --> 02:23:34.000
caffeine in it and it'll get you it'll get you what you need all right so the violation level four

1619
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.96
yes sure i i drink a lot of coffee and a lot of caffeine and yeah that's jockel white tea's got

1620
02:23:40.96 --> 02:23:44.96
plenty of caffeine for me it's a legit i'll tell you what i like about it with a cans of it would

1621
02:23:44.96 --> 02:23:50.56
take care well it's been crazy hot and Texas summer yeah and just just pull it with freezing cold

1622
02:23:50.56 --> 02:23:55.60
one out of the if i'm out of the jockel my truck that's you know 125 degrees from sitting out of the

1623
02:23:55.60 --> 02:24:01.52
sun and crack up in a super cold roll around the road it's pretty legit you're still alive my

1624
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:05.04
low i got to make it you know i got to make is i got to make something that like this that you

1625
02:24:05.04 --> 02:24:09.92
can drink before you go to bed at night oh yeah just because because i can't i mean i want

1626
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:14.64
some of them since seven or eight o'clock at night and i think i'm gonna crack one open but then

1627
02:24:14.64 --> 02:24:21.44
i think now then i'll be all fired up all night yeah yeah what like you put some sort of um

1628
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:26.64
because there's like you know tea what he called the tea that you brew before bed makes you smell

1629
02:24:26.64 --> 02:24:31.92
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of that yeah yeah kind of a male tea oh wow you know what we got

1630
02:24:31.92 --> 02:24:37.76
situation here let me comment in strong for the tea you made your you made your bread no

1631
02:24:37.76 --> 02:24:41.04
tell me you don't know all about tea i didn't know about what is it camera meal

1632
02:24:41.04 --> 02:24:47.12
yeah look at you yeah so you could take that apology right you could you could call it

1633
02:24:47.12 --> 02:24:51.60
so we could on jockel can a meal tea oh you know you could call it that if you want yeah

1634
02:24:51.60 --> 02:24:55.04
i would probably just call it like well i'll figure something out but i will do that

1635
02:24:55.04 --> 02:24:59.08
because I do need something at night, warm, hot in the summertime,

1636
02:24:59.08 --> 02:25:02.80
or hot in the wintertime, but you could drink a cold that's tasty.

1637
02:25:02.80 --> 02:25:06.40
Because that's the thing about the, the jokalway tea is the taste is good.

1638
02:25:06.40 --> 02:25:08.40
Like we had this, I thought we were going with this,

1639
02:25:08.40 --> 02:25:14.76
if you had a can of jokalway tea and a can of the most sweet,

1640
02:25:14.76 --> 02:25:19.08
like, like, doctored up thing that's supposed to taste delicious,

1641
02:25:19.08 --> 02:25:19.92
which would you pick?

1642
02:25:19.92 --> 02:25:23.04
I picked jokalway tea all day long because the taste is, you know,

1643
02:25:23.04 --> 02:25:26.12
when you, you know when you realize that gatorade,

1644
02:25:26.12 --> 02:25:28.56
no offense against gatorade, no, a little bit of offense-gure.

1645
02:25:28.56 --> 02:25:31.36
You know when you realize that gatorade doesn't actually

1646
02:25:31.36 --> 02:25:35.48
quench your thirst, like when you're, I don't know,

1647
02:25:35.48 --> 02:25:38.60
I think I was 20, right?

1648
02:25:38.60 --> 02:25:40.32
And I was real thirsty and I drank a gatorade,

1649
02:25:40.32 --> 02:25:41.56
and I was like, why am I still thirsty?

1650
02:25:41.56 --> 02:25:42.56
Yeah, yeah.

1651
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:44.68
That because there's syrup in there or whatever,

1652
02:25:44.68 --> 02:25:46.08
doesn't work good.

1653
02:25:46.08 --> 02:25:47.52
Jokalway tea, you get that quench.

1654
02:25:47.52 --> 02:25:49.48
Not like it, that's a quench, go on.

1655
02:25:49.48 --> 02:25:53.60
Well, this for back to the, or the pre workout mix

1656
02:25:53.60 --> 02:25:57.76
in the tea scenario, this person that we're talking about

1657
02:25:57.76 --> 02:26:01.64
didn't finish it because it did jump up the whole tea scenario.

1658
02:26:01.64 --> 02:26:02.48
Okay.

1659
02:26:02.48 --> 02:26:03.20
It was like a theory.

1660
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:03.66
Very cool.

1661
02:26:03.66 --> 02:26:05.70
Check.

1662
02:26:05.70 --> 02:26:07.88
There it is, boom.

1663
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:09.64
Jokalway tea, outstanding.

1664
02:26:09.64 --> 02:26:12.68
Hey, books, we got way of the warrior kid books,

1665
02:26:12.68 --> 02:26:15.40
way of the warrior kid, and Mark's mission.

1666
02:26:15.40 --> 02:26:18.88
Those are good books for kids to read.

1667
02:26:18.88 --> 02:26:21.16
Just talking to a teacher out in the gym,

1668
02:26:21.16 --> 02:26:23.88
teaching the book, eighth grade, if you're wondering

1669
02:26:23.88 --> 02:26:26.08
about how old is an eighth grader?

1670
02:26:26.08 --> 02:26:28.12
11, 12, 11, 12.

1671
02:26:28.12 --> 02:26:29.12
Yes.

1672
02:26:29.12 --> 02:26:31.20
So 11, 12 year old, definitely in the same team.

1673
02:26:31.20 --> 02:26:34.68
Sometimes when I meet someone and their kid is eight

1674
02:26:34.68 --> 02:26:37.40
or 10, I just think your kids in the zone.

1675
02:26:37.40 --> 02:26:40.48
And they did get so way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.

1676
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:43.96
I just started reading the way the warrior kid to my son.

1677
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:45.16
Does he get a history, right?

1678
02:26:45.16 --> 02:26:46.96
Is he getting it?

1679
02:26:46.96 --> 02:26:48.84
We got about 30 pages into it.

1680
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:49.64
He was so fired up.

1681
02:26:49.64 --> 02:26:52.56
And he wanted to go out and disobey all of a sudden.

1682
02:26:52.56 --> 02:26:53.08
It's funny.

1683
02:26:53.08 --> 02:26:54.36
They get certain parts.

1684
02:26:54.36 --> 02:26:55.20
Right.

1685
02:26:55.20 --> 02:26:59.08
The grander kind of messages may not compute quite yet,

1686
02:26:59.08 --> 02:27:00.44
but they'll get certain parts.

1687
02:27:00.44 --> 02:27:02.48
So they'll like when this part comes.

1688
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:03.32
Yeah.

1689
02:27:03.32 --> 02:27:04.16
It's keep doing it.

1690
02:27:04.16 --> 02:27:05.24
Stoke to the feedback on that one.

1691
02:27:05.24 --> 02:27:08.08
Also, just funnacles freedom field manual.

1692
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:11.04
It's a manual about how to get after it.

1693
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:13.52
And the audio version is not unautable.

1694
02:27:13.52 --> 02:27:15.76
It's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play,

1695
02:27:15.76 --> 02:27:17.56
and other MP3 platforms.

1696
02:27:17.56 --> 02:27:19.64
So you can make it a specifically.

1697
02:27:19.64 --> 02:27:20.64
We did that.

1698
02:27:20.64 --> 02:27:20.84
Yeah.

1699
02:27:20.84 --> 02:27:22.40
Maybe took a little financial hit.

1700
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:26.28
Whatever, want people to be able to use it as an alarm clock

1701
02:27:26.28 --> 02:27:28.40
in their phone or a ringtone.

1702
02:27:28.40 --> 02:27:30.36
So that's what you can do there.

1703
02:27:30.36 --> 02:27:34.08
Those are a few books.

1704
02:27:34.08 --> 02:27:37.88
Then we got the McGutt Extreme Ownership, obviously,

1705
02:27:37.88 --> 02:27:40.32
which Jack went out for three years now.

1706
02:27:40.32 --> 02:27:42.04
We have a new addition out.

1707
02:27:42.04 --> 02:27:44.88
And of course, that caught me a leadership,

1708
02:27:44.88 --> 02:27:46.80
which we were just talking about.

1709
02:27:46.80 --> 02:27:49.64
And that's for it's available now for pre-order.

1710
02:27:49.64 --> 02:27:51.48
It'll be released September 25th.

1711
02:27:51.48 --> 02:27:52.56
Super excited about that.

1712
02:27:52.56 --> 02:27:55.52
Looking forward to all your readers out there

1713
02:27:55.52 --> 02:27:57.32
providing some feedback on that.

1714
02:27:57.32 --> 02:28:01.16
And I hope this is at least as useful to you

1715
02:28:01.16 --> 02:28:03.28
in your life's professional and personal lives

1716
02:28:03.28 --> 02:28:04.28
as Extreme Ownership.

1717
02:28:04.28 --> 02:28:08.72
So go get some dichotomy leadership, find the balance.

1718
02:28:08.72 --> 02:28:13.08
You also, Dave, talk to me about the difference

1719
02:28:13.08 --> 02:28:18.68
between first edition and let's say fifth edition of a book,

1720
02:28:18.68 --> 02:28:21.12
which would you rather have?

1721
02:28:21.12 --> 02:28:24.12
Which would I rather have?

1722
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:25.80
Yeah.

1723
02:28:25.80 --> 02:28:27.32
I'd have to go with the first edition.

1724
02:28:27.32 --> 02:28:28.32
That's right.

1725
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:29.52
That's sort of a standard.

1726
02:28:29.52 --> 02:28:30.32
Yeah, it's the standard.

1727
02:28:30.32 --> 02:28:31.72
Is there anyone running around going, man?

1728
02:28:31.72 --> 02:28:32.92
I wish I had the night to this.

1729
02:28:32.92 --> 02:28:36.04
Yeah, can't wait for that fourth edition.

1730
02:28:36.04 --> 02:28:37.88
That is pretty cool with Extreme Ownership,

1731
02:28:37.88 --> 02:28:41.88
with people still come up to us and have,

1732
02:28:41.88 --> 02:28:44.20
with the, and the original paper,

1733
02:28:44.20 --> 02:28:47.28
this was printed on was not very good for Extreme Ownership.

1734
02:28:47.28 --> 02:28:49.32
It doesn't have the,

1735
02:28:49.32 --> 02:28:51.24
and it doesn't have the number one New York Times best set

1736
02:28:51.24 --> 02:28:52.08
across the top.

1737
02:28:52.08 --> 02:28:54.24
So every once we still see some of those,

1738
02:28:54.24 --> 02:28:55.16
you know, like, wow, that's a,

1739
02:28:55.16 --> 02:28:57.12
that was a first printing run.

1740
02:28:57.12 --> 02:28:58.12
I just, it's pretty cool.

1741
02:28:58.12 --> 02:28:59.12
I just did that the other day.

1742
02:28:59.12 --> 02:29:03.08
So a girl came up and I was signing her first edition.

1743
02:29:03.08 --> 02:29:06.60
And there's four editions that you could possibly have.

1744
02:29:06.60 --> 02:29:07.44
There's more than that.

1745
02:29:07.44 --> 02:29:09.76
But the first one that came out is white,

1746
02:29:09.76 --> 02:29:11.000
and there's no stick around.

1747
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.16
As soon as that made New York Times best set,

1748
02:29:13.16 --> 02:29:14.20
they went and got stickers.

1749
02:29:14.20 --> 02:29:15.56
It says number one New York Times best set,

1750
02:29:15.56 --> 02:29:16.24
and they put them everywhere,

1751
02:29:16.24 --> 02:29:18.80
because it's an advertising gig, right?

1752
02:29:18.80 --> 02:29:22.96
But there's, so the people that got the first 10,000 copies,

1753
02:29:22.96 --> 02:29:25.000
it's just a plain first dish.

1754
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.16
So I know there's people.

1755
02:29:28.16 --> 02:29:30.44
And then you got, then they got the stickers on it.

1756
02:29:30.44 --> 02:29:31.88
So you're still early.

1757
02:29:31.88 --> 02:29:33.80
Then you got the one that actually has printed

1758
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:36.28
on the cover, number one New York Times best set,

1759
02:29:36.28 --> 02:29:39.60
and then finally we get to the fourth,

1760
02:29:39.60 --> 02:29:43.000
the fourth version, which is the black cover,

1761
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.84
back in black, which is,

1762
02:29:44.84 --> 02:29:46.20
we have to say that one's pretty cool.

1763
02:29:46.20 --> 02:29:47.04
It's cool.

1764
02:29:47.04 --> 02:29:47.88
It's a different color.

1765
02:29:47.88 --> 02:29:49.20
It's a different avenue.

1766
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:50.04
It's coolness.

1767
02:29:50.04 --> 02:29:51.08
Yeah, it's a different avenue of coolness.

1768
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:53.48
But still the first edition,

1769
02:29:53.48 --> 02:29:54.96
we always like the first edition.

1770
02:29:54.96 --> 02:29:58.76
And if you, so my point is, if you want the first edition,

1771
02:29:58.76 --> 02:30:01.16
you got to order it pre.

1772
02:30:01.16 --> 02:30:03.000
Otherwise you're going to get some other,

1773
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.88
you'll get one that says something else on it,

1774
02:30:04.88 --> 02:30:07.08
be all different and we'll know.

1775
02:30:07.08 --> 02:30:07.92
What do you mean?

1776
02:30:07.92 --> 02:30:09.000
I'll just, I'll just be,

1777
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.20
I'll show you what we just signed up.

1778
02:30:10.20 --> 02:30:11.04
Yeah.

1779
02:30:11.04 --> 02:30:11.88
That's cool.

1780
02:30:11.88 --> 02:30:13.48
I'm glad you got in the game, eventually.

1781
02:30:13.48 --> 02:30:15.60
Ha ha.

1782
02:30:15.60 --> 02:30:18.52
Oh, no, I'm gonna appreciate it.

1783
02:30:18.52 --> 02:30:21.12
That's the long front.

1784
02:30:21.12 --> 02:30:23.28
If you're interested in coming and bringing us in,

1785
02:30:23.28 --> 02:30:25.28
talk to your leadership team,

1786
02:30:25.28 --> 02:30:27.88
your frontline troops, your mid-level managers,

1787
02:30:27.88 --> 02:30:29.96
whatever it may be, that's what we do with that

1788
02:30:29.96 --> 02:30:32.68
long front is we solve problems through leadership.

1789
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:33.68
Everything that we wrote about,

1790
02:30:33.68 --> 02:30:35.80
extreme ownership, all the things that we just talked about

1791
02:30:35.80 --> 02:30:37.20
from dichotomy leadership,

1792
02:30:37.20 --> 02:30:38.64
is what we do.

1793
02:30:38.64 --> 02:30:39.84
It's me and Jaco.

1794
02:30:39.84 --> 02:30:43.000
We launched this company going on seven years now,

1795
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.84
and we worked with a lot of company sense.

1796
02:30:44.84 --> 02:30:47.04
And now, in addition, we've got,

1797
02:30:47.04 --> 02:30:49.20

02:30:53.08 --> 02:30:55.68
and we just picked up a new member of our team,

1801
02:30:55.68 --> 02:30:57.76

02:31:08.76 --> 02:31:13.76
Also, we got the Muster, which is two days leadership,

1807
02:31:15.56 --> 02:31:18.12
conference seminar gathering,

1808
02:31:18.12 --> 02:31:18.96
that's what I'm talking about.

1809
02:31:18.96 --> 02:31:21.12
It's a leadership master, that's what it is.

1810
02:31:21.12 --> 02:31:24.60
October 17th, 18th, up in San Francisco,

1811
02:31:24.60 --> 02:31:26.16
all the other ones have sold out,

1812
02:31:26.16 --> 02:31:27.28
this is the sixth monster,

1813
02:31:27.28 --> 02:31:29.60
they've also sold out, this one's gonna sell out,

1814
02:31:29.60 --> 02:31:30.60
even earlier actually.

1815
02:31:30.60 --> 02:31:31.44
I think so.

1816
02:31:31.44 --> 02:31:33.24
We're way ahead of schedule,

1817
02:31:33.24 --> 02:31:35.64
you wanna come to it extremownership.com,

1818
02:31:35.64 --> 02:31:37.16
you can come to the Muster.

1819
02:31:38.28 --> 02:31:42.24
And then also for our military law enforcement,

1820
02:31:42.24 --> 02:31:44.92
firefighters, Border Patrol,

1821
02:31:44.92 --> 02:31:48.12
Paramedics, first responders, anybody in uniform,

1822
02:31:48.12 --> 02:31:52.52
we're launching our first ever first responder, military,

1823
02:31:52.52 --> 02:31:56.84
uniform wearing focused leadership gathering.

1824
02:31:56.84 --> 02:31:58.88
And this is, we're calling the roll call, roll call,

1825
02:31:58.88 --> 02:32:01.68
here's their one, first ever is gonna happen,

1826
02:32:01.68 --> 02:32:04.24
September 21st in Dallas.

1827
02:32:04.24 --> 02:32:06.72
And this thing is, it was by request,

1828
02:32:06.72 --> 02:32:10.000
we worked with so many different first responders,

1829
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.24
and fire departments and law enforcement groups

1830
02:32:14.24 --> 02:32:17.48
and police departments, federal, state, local.

1831
02:32:17.48 --> 02:32:22.000
We were worked with all levels of these groups.

1832
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.68
And we've had so many folks say,

1833
02:32:23.68 --> 02:32:28.68
hey, can we have a focus leadership conference just for us?

1834
02:32:28.68 --> 02:32:29.76
And that's what this is.

1835
02:32:29.76 --> 02:32:33.44
So we've got several hundred people already signed up for this thing.

1836
02:32:33.44 --> 02:32:34.76
This is for you guys.

1837
02:32:34.76 --> 02:32:35.44
This is for all you, all you,

1838
02:32:35.44 --> 02:32:36.88
all you, you, lissor, that are interesting this.

1839
02:32:36.88 --> 02:32:38.44
We try to make it at a price point.

1840
02:32:38.44 --> 02:32:40.80
That was much more affordable than the Muster,

1841
02:32:40.80 --> 02:32:43.60
so that we could, we could have as many folks attend

1842
02:32:43.60 --> 02:32:45.24
as could come.

1843
02:32:45.24 --> 02:32:46.68
And we hope you come from far,

1844
02:32:46.68 --> 02:32:48.56
might be there gonna be talking about the importance

1845
02:32:48.56 --> 02:32:51.56
of training, the importance of dealing with what you deal

1846
02:32:51.56 --> 02:32:53.88
with every day and driving those standards

1847
02:32:53.88 --> 02:32:58.12
and pushing your team and leading up the chain,

1848
02:32:58.12 --> 02:33:03.12
as well as all those kind of specific law enforcement,

1849
02:33:03.64 --> 02:33:07.44
firefighter, first responder, military focused issues,

1850
02:33:07.44 --> 02:33:08.92
that we can really dive into.

1851
02:33:08.92 --> 02:33:10.44
We don't have to talk about the business leader stuff

1852
02:33:10.44 --> 02:33:12.36
because this is for you guys, that's what it's for.

1853
02:33:12.36 --> 02:33:13.76
So if you're interested in that,

1854
02:33:13.76 --> 02:33:15.28
if you're on the fence, if you're thinking about it,

1855
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:20.28
come join us for a roll call at Dallas September 21st.

1856
02:33:21.36 --> 02:33:24.000
And of course, you've heard on this podcast,

1857
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.32
we launched a new company, a subsidiary company,

1858
02:33:28.32 --> 02:33:31.08
to Esslon Front, it's called Esslon Front Overwatch,

1859
02:33:31.08 --> 02:33:33.24
our EF Overwatch.

1860
02:33:33.24 --> 02:33:38.08
And you can check that out at EFOverWatch.com.

1861
02:33:38.08 --> 02:33:40.84
It's a great company designed to,

1862
02:33:42.12 --> 02:33:44.76
one of the biggest things that we see

1863
02:33:44.76 --> 02:33:46.56
from the companies who work with is people ask us,

1864
02:33:46.56 --> 02:33:48.48
where can we get people like you?

1865
02:33:48.48 --> 02:33:51.84
Where can we get folks from a mindset of extreme ownership?

1866
02:33:51.84 --> 02:33:54.92
And so we started that in the Special Operations world

1867
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:59.12
and the goal of Overwatch is to take special operations,

1868
02:33:59.12 --> 02:34:01.92
veterans and combat aviator veterans

1869
02:34:01.92 --> 02:34:04.80
and place them in companies with,

1870
02:34:06.60 --> 02:34:09.04
place them in companies who are looking for people

1871
02:34:09.04 --> 02:34:10.40
with that mindset.

1872
02:34:10.40 --> 02:34:13.20
And EFOverWatch is,

1873
02:34:13.20 --> 02:34:14.60
is some I'm super excited about,

1874
02:34:14.60 --> 02:34:16.68
we have a massive demand signal right now,

1875
02:34:16.68 --> 02:34:18.20
frankly, we have a lot more clients

1876
02:34:18.20 --> 02:34:19.36
that are reaching out these companies

1877
02:34:19.36 --> 02:34:24.36
that are seeking folks to place and offer them job opportunities.

1878
02:34:24.96 --> 02:34:26.000
And we have a lot more clients

1879
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.28
than we have on the candidate side.

1880
02:34:27.28 --> 02:34:30.24
So if you're a Special Operator

1881
02:34:30.24 --> 02:34:32.64
and you're about to be retired

1882
02:34:32.64 --> 02:34:35.52
or leaving just leaving the military

1883
02:34:35.52 --> 02:34:37.12
or I've left even a few years ago

1884
02:34:37.12 --> 02:34:39.32
or on the combat aviation side,

1885
02:34:39.32 --> 02:34:43.82
go to eFOverWatch.com, fill out the application there

1886
02:34:43.82 --> 02:34:45.12
and start the paperwork

1887
02:34:45.12 --> 02:34:48.48
because we got, there's an awesome opportunity

1888
02:34:48.48 --> 02:34:50.84
here for some great companies

1889
02:34:50.84 --> 02:34:53.000
with some great leadership positions

1890
02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.96
and some promising promotion opportunities

1891
02:34:55.96 --> 02:34:58.16
and some companies that exhibit extreme ownership

1892
02:34:58.16 --> 02:34:59.92
that have that as part of their culture.

1893
02:34:59.92 --> 02:35:02.000
So don't miss out on those opportunities,

1894
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.48

a lot of massive opportunity out there.

1899

and supporting this podcast

1921
02:36:07.44 --> 02:36:10.24
especially to those people

1922
02:36:10.24 --> 02:36:12.92
that make this podcast possible.

1923
02:36:14.48 --> 02:36:16.76
The people that make this podcast possible.

1924
02:36:17.64 --> 02:36:20.08
And it's not some long list of sponsors

1925
02:36:20.08 --> 02:36:22.24
that people that make this podcast possible

1926
02:36:22.24 --> 02:36:26.12
is our military or police law enforcement,

1927
02:36:26.12 --> 02:36:27.48
firefighters, border patrol,

1928
02:36:27.48 --> 02:36:29.60
paramedics, other first responders.

1929
02:36:29.60 --> 02:36:33.12
Without you protecting us from evil abroad

1930
02:36:33.12 --> 02:36:35.84
and keeping us safe here at home,

1931
02:36:35.84 --> 02:36:38.80
we wouldn't be able to do what we do.

1932
02:36:38.80 --> 02:36:42.36
So thank you for doing what you do

1933
02:36:43.36 --> 02:36:46.72
and to everyone else out there

1934
02:36:46.72 --> 02:36:49.20
whether you are making something

1935
02:36:49.20 --> 02:36:50.68
or baking something,

1936
02:36:50.68 --> 02:36:54.48
whether you're serving food or serving warrants,

1937
02:36:54.48 --> 02:36:56.32
whether you work in a bank

1938
02:36:56.32 --> 02:36:58.04
or you build banks.

1939
02:36:58.04 --> 02:37:00.28
If you wear a suit and tie

1940
02:37:00.28 --> 02:37:03.24
or you wear coveralls and a hard hat

1941
02:37:03.24 --> 02:37:06.84
no matter who you are and what you do

1942
02:37:06.84 --> 02:37:09.64
do it to the best of your ability.

1943
02:37:09.64 --> 02:37:13.40
Take pride in your work and be the best you can

1944
02:37:13.40 --> 02:37:15.20
but at the same time,

1945
02:37:16.48 --> 02:37:17.72
stay balanced.

1946
02:37:18.72 --> 02:37:21.16
Be aggressive but not reckless.

1947
02:37:21.16 --> 02:37:24.44
Take ownership but empower your team.

1948
02:37:24.44 --> 02:37:26.76
Be humble but not passive.

1949
02:37:28.08 --> 02:37:29.20
Be disciplined.

1950
02:37:30.24 --> 02:37:31.44
But be free.

1951
02:37:32.44 --> 02:37:34.76
Balance that I caught a meter ship

1952
02:37:34.76 --> 02:37:37.40
and the dichotomies of life

1953
02:37:37.40 --> 02:37:39.52
and as you do that,

1954
02:37:40.72 --> 02:37:42.04
keep getting after it.

1955
02:37:43.04 --> 02:37:45.48
And until next time,

1956
02:37:45.48 --> 02:37:48.28
this is life and echo and jockel.

1957
02:37:48.28 --> 02:38:05.40
Out.
