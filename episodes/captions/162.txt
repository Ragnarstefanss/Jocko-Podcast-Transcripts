00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocobodgast number 162 with echo Charles and me, Jocobo-Willink. Good evening,
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.56 echo. Good evening. On the 22nd of April 2008, two marine battalions, the first battalion
00:00:19.56 --> 00:00:25.32 ninth Marines, the walking dead from Vietnam fame, and the second battalion eighth
00:00:25.32 --> 00:00:35.48 Marines were switching out in Ramadi, Iraq. One battalion going home in a few days, and
00:00:35.48 --> 00:00:45.56 the other just starting its seven-month tour. Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:54.000 Corporal Jordan Herger, 22 and 20 years old, respectively, one from each battalion. They
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.44 were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate to an outpost that contained a
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:08.16 makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines. The same broken down Ram shackled building was
00:01:08.16 --> 00:01:16.44 also home to a hundred Iraqi police. They were my men in this fight against the terrorist
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:27.60 in Ramadi. Yale was a dirt poor mixed race kid from Virginia, with a wife and a daughter
00:01:27.60 --> 00:01:38.000 and a mother and a sister who lived with them, and he supported them as well on $13,000 a year.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000 Herger was a middle-class white kid from Long Island. The two of them were from two
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.60 completely different worlds in our country. Not good, not bad, just different. Had they
00:01:55.60 --> 00:02:01.36 not join the Marine Corps, they would never have known each other. They would never have
00:02:01.36 --> 00:02:08.000 even understood that multiple America's exists simultaneously, depending on your education
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.64 level, your families income status, maybe, but they were Marines. They were combat Marines.
00:02:18.64 --> 00:02:24.72 And because of this bond, they were brothers as close as if they were born to the same
00:02:24.72 --> 00:02:34.44 woman. The mission orders they received from the sergeant, their squad leader, I am sure
00:02:34.44 --> 00:02:42.80 when something like this. Okay, you two clowns. Stand this post and let no unauthorized
00:02:42.80 --> 00:02:51.16 personnel or vehicles pass. You clear on that? I'm also sure that Yale and herder than
00:02:51.16 --> 00:02:57.56 rolled their eyes and said in unison something like, yes, sergeant, we got it. We know
00:02:57.56 --> 00:03:04.12 what we're doing. With just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words
00:03:04.12 --> 00:03:13.48 no kidding sweetheart, we know what we're doing. They then relieved the two other Marines
00:03:13.48 --> 00:03:21.80 on watch who turns out we're probably the two luckiest Marines on Earth that day. And they
00:03:21.80 --> 00:03:28.48 assumed they're post at the entry control point at joint security station, NASA in the
00:03:28.48 --> 00:03:37.76 Soviet District of Ramadi, Iraq. A few minutes later, a large blue truck turned down the
00:03:37.76 --> 00:03:45.92 alleyway. The alleyway was no more than 100 yards in length and sped its way through the
00:03:45.92 --> 00:03:55.36 serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were
00:03:55.36 --> 00:04:05.60 posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. If you know what combat is like,
00:04:05.60 --> 00:04:14.88 you know what I'm talking about when I say catastrophically. 24 brick masonry houses were damaged
00:04:14.88 --> 00:04:24.96 or destroyed by the blast. A mask 100 yards away collapsed. The trucks engine came to
00:04:24.96 --> 00:04:35.44 rest 200 meters away knocking most of a building down before it stopped. Our EOD guys, our explosive
00:04:35.44 --> 00:04:43.84 guys, wrecking the blast was made of at least 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died.
00:04:45.84 --> 00:04:51.76 And because these two young infantry men didn't have it in their DNA to run from danger,
00:04:51.76 --> 00:05:04.56 150 men, 50 US Marines and 100 Iraqis were saved. When I read the situation report about the
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:08.48 incident a few hours after it happened, I called the regimental commander and I asked him
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:18.80 for details of what had happened. It seemed different to me. Unfortunately, Marines dying or being
00:05:18.80 --> 00:05:29.12 seriously wounded is common in combat. We expect Marines and for that matter soldiers, sailors,
00:05:29.12 --> 00:05:37.44 airmen and co-scardsmen regardless of rank or MOS to do their duty to stand their ground and do their
00:05:37.44 --> 00:05:49.76 duty and to die if that's what the mission requires. The regimental commander had just returned
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:55.44 from the site and he agreed with me, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event.
00:05:55.44 --> 00:06:03.68 Just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened
00:06:03.68 --> 00:06:09.68 and then to recognize and decorate these two young Marines and acknowledge their bravery,
00:06:09.68 --> 00:06:15.92 I'd have to do it myself. Because I understood that the bureaucrats back in Washington
00:06:15.92 --> 00:06:23.52 would never accept Iraqi statements for what had taken place. If getting these Marines properly
00:06:23.52 --> 00:06:34.72 awarded had any chance at all, it had to come under my signature as a general officer.
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:40.64 So I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half dozen Iraqi police,
00:06:41.60 --> 00:06:49.20 all of whom told the same story. They said the blue truck turned down into the alley
00:06:49.20 --> 00:06:54.000 and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine jersey walls.
00:06:56.56 --> 00:07:03.60 They all said they knew immediately what was going on, particularly as the Marines began to fire.
00:07:06.24 --> 00:07:17.12 The Iraqi police all began firing as well. Then to a man, they ran for safety just prior to the
00:07:17.12 --> 00:07:26.40 explosion. They all survived. Many were injured, some seriously injured.
00:07:30.80 --> 00:07:37.36 One of the Iraqis said to me that they had all run from the danger like any normal man would
00:07:37.36 --> 00:07:45.60 to save his own life. What he didn't know until then, what he learned that very day,
00:07:47.12 --> 00:07:48.96 was that Americans are not normal.
00:07:52.24 --> 00:07:58.64 With tears wailing up, he said, sir, in the name of God, no sane man would have stood there and done
00:07:58.64 --> 00:08:13.12 what they'd done. No sane man. They saved all of us. What we didn't know at the time,
00:08:14.48 --> 00:08:20.32 and what I didn't know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later, after I wrote a summary
00:08:20.32 --> 00:08:26.48 of this bravery and submitted it and submitted them both Yale and Herger for the Navy crosses,
00:08:26.48 --> 00:08:31.20 which is the number two award from Marines and sailors in combat.
00:08:32.96 --> 00:08:39.28 What I didn't know was that one of our security cameras that we had at the location,
00:08:39.92 --> 00:08:44.40 that was damaged initially in the blast, had called everything.
00:08:47.60 --> 00:08:51.20 It had happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it to me.
00:08:51.20 --> 00:08:58.48 It took exactly six seconds by that recording from when the truck entered the alley
00:08:59.04 --> 00:09:04.000 until it exploded. Six seconds.
00:09:08.48 --> 00:09:17.36 And you can watch, and I did watch many, many times on this recording, the last six seconds of their
00:09:17.36 --> 00:09:27.52 young lives. When it first started, I suppose it took a second or so for the Marines to
00:09:27.52 --> 00:09:35.36 separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on. They had no time to talk it over.
00:09:37.20 --> 00:09:41.92 Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant had told them to do
00:09:41.92 --> 00:09:46.32 only a few minutes before, let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.
00:09:50.72 --> 00:09:54.72 At that point in the recording, the two Marines had about five seconds left to live.
00:09:58.64 --> 00:10:03.20 It took maybe another two seconds for the two jarheads to raise their weapons,
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:05.36 take game and open fire on the truck.
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:11.92 By this time, the truck was halfway through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time.
00:10:14.88 --> 00:10:20.32 Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi policemen, some of whom had fired their AKs,
00:10:20.32 --> 00:10:23.04 now scattering like the normal and rational men they were.
00:10:24.24 --> 00:10:26.72 Some running right past the Marines.
00:10:26.72 --> 00:10:34.08 The two Marines had about three seconds left to live.
00:10:38.24 --> 00:10:45.28 For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines weapons firing nonstop.
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:52.40 The trucks windshield exploded into shards of glass as their rounds took it apart
00:10:52.40 --> 00:10:57.84 and undoubtedly tore into the body of this terrorist that was trying to kill their brothers.
00:11:01.36 --> 00:11:06.48 On the way of the danger at the time, the other Marines and Iraqi soldiers in the barracks
00:11:07.20 --> 00:11:12.24 could take comfort in the fact that two Marines were on watch and would die before they ran.
00:11:12.24 --> 00:11:21.68 The recording shows the truck co-reening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines.
00:11:25.44 --> 00:11:30.80 In all of this instantaneous violence, Yale and Herder never hesitated.
00:11:34.08 --> 00:11:35.36 They never stepped back.
00:11:37.28 --> 00:11:39.84 They never even started to step back.
00:11:39.84 --> 00:11:41.68 They never even shifted their weight.
00:11:44.40 --> 00:11:49.92 With their feet spread shoulder with the part, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could.
00:11:55.52 --> 00:11:57.36 They only had one second left to live.
00:12:02.48 --> 00:12:03.68 Then the truck explodes.
00:12:03.68 --> 00:12:14.48 The camera goes blank and the two young men go to their god.
00:12:22.80 --> 00:12:23.52 Six seconds.
00:12:27.28 --> 00:12:29.44 Not enough time to think about their families,
00:12:29.44 --> 00:12:36.88 their country, their flag, for about their lives, or their deaths.
00:12:39.76 --> 00:12:47.28 But more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty
00:12:50.56 --> 00:12:51.60 into eternity.
00:12:51.60 --> 00:13:08.96 That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world, tonight for you.
00:13:08.96 --> 00:13:34.48 And that was a speech that was given by Marine Corps, General Kelly, and he gave the speech to
00:13:34.48 --> 00:13:43.76 Gold Star families. These are families who have lost a service member, killed in action.
00:13:45.52 --> 00:13:50.08 And he gave that speech on February 21st, 2014.
00:13:53.84 --> 00:13:58.16 And General Kelly was obviously speaking from the heart.
00:13:58.16 --> 00:14:07.92 Not only was he the commanding General in charge of those Marines,
00:14:13.20 --> 00:14:17.12 but he also understands loss on a very personal level.
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:25.44 Because on November 9th, 2010, General Kelly's oldest son,
00:14:25.44 --> 00:14:33.12 first lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action.
00:14:34.24 --> 00:14:36.80 By landmine, while he was on patrol,
00:14:38.08 --> 00:14:41.60 leading upiltoon of Marines in Afghanistan.
00:14:41.60 --> 00:14:54.24 And that story of those two Marines is
00:14:57.12 --> 00:15:06.24 yet another example of the dedication and the devotion of the Marines.
00:15:06.24 --> 00:15:15.28 And we know full well that there is example after example,
00:15:15.28 --> 00:15:18.32 after example from all our branches of service.
00:15:23.44 --> 00:15:27.12 Examples of sacrifice.
00:15:27.12 --> 00:15:39.28 And you can think about those six seconds.
00:15:46.32 --> 00:15:51.52 Six seconds, we throw those away all the time.
00:15:51.52 --> 00:15:59.60 We can waste hours and days. We can even waste weeks.
00:16:02.48 --> 00:16:05.36 As if we have an endless supply.
00:16:10.32 --> 00:16:10.88 But we don't.
00:16:10.88 --> 00:16:20.40 But if you were giving six seconds to live,
00:16:23.20 --> 00:16:24.24 what would fill your mind?
00:16:28.96 --> 00:16:30.08 Would you be okay with that?
00:16:33.52 --> 00:16:37.04 Would you nod your head and think, okay?
00:16:37.04 --> 00:16:40.08 It's time.
00:16:46.08 --> 00:16:47.68 Or would you be filled with regret?
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:55.52 In those last moments, would you think about what you should have done?
00:16:55.52 --> 00:17:06.16 What you should have said? Who you should have been?
00:17:11.76 --> 00:17:25.36 And in the end, would you realize that there's no reason ever to waste six seconds of your
00:17:25.36 --> 00:17:29.20 life?
00:17:35.28 --> 00:17:36.88 That is one lesson.
00:17:39.28 --> 00:17:42.64 We can take away from General Kelly's speech.
00:17:42.64 --> 00:17:51.92 Six seconds can be an eternity.
00:17:55.60 --> 00:17:58.16 Another lesson we can take away from this speech.
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:05.76 And from it's author knowing that General Kelly had lost his son is that we have to move forward.
00:18:05.76 --> 00:18:13.92 We have to move on. And this isn't to say, don't feel anything.
00:18:15.76 --> 00:18:18.40 Because that's wrong. And that is not what we are doing.
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.84 I mean, who can fathom the pain that General Kelly felt at the loss of his eldest son?
00:18:29.84 --> 00:18:39.04 As his eldest son pursued a career that was no doubt inspired by the General himself.
00:18:45.28 --> 00:18:48.56 But he moved on. He drove on.
00:18:48.56 --> 00:18:56.56 I was talking to a friend of mine.
00:19:00.08 --> 00:19:03.68 And we were talking about survivors guilt,
00:19:06.80 --> 00:19:10.32 which is something that we all feel on some level
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:14.16 when we're in the military.
00:19:14.16 --> 00:19:21.52 And sometimes I think people feel as if there's something wrong with them
00:19:23.36 --> 00:19:28.56 or they feel like they're weak because they let their emotions get a hold of them sometimes.
00:19:31.76 --> 00:19:34.000 And I could see my friend stealing that.
00:19:35.68 --> 00:19:42.16 And I told them about an interview that I did with Colonel Tom Fife on this podcast.
00:19:42.16 --> 00:19:48.72 He was an army officer that had served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:51.20 He had gotten a purple heart in all three wars.
00:19:53.52 --> 00:20:02.32 And I explained to my friend that as Colonel Fife and I were discussing the men that he lost in Vietnam,
00:20:05.36 --> 00:20:06.64 Colonel Fife got choked up.
00:20:06.64 --> 00:20:12.64 Despite the fact that 51 years had passed since he lost those men.
00:20:17.04 --> 00:20:21.84 51 years, but he's still got emotional.
00:20:25.44 --> 00:20:29.44 Why is that?
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:31.04 It's because we care about our men.
00:20:31.04 --> 00:20:33.44 Because we're not going to be able to do that.
00:20:33.44 --> 00:20:38.000 Why is that? It's because we care about our men because we care about each other.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.96 And it's because while we hear that time heals all wounds, time does not remove the scars.
00:20:46.96 --> 00:20:49.76 They are going to be there and they are going to hurt.
00:20:53.04 --> 00:20:53.84 And that's okay.
00:20:58.24 --> 00:20:59.84 And that's normal.
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:03.12 It's normal to feel the pain and it's normal to feel the guilt.
00:21:03.12 --> 00:21:07.28 And I think that's one of the hardest things for vets that I talked to
00:21:08.88 --> 00:21:11.20 is that they don't think that this is normal.
00:21:15.84 --> 00:21:18.64 But I am telling you, it is normal.
00:21:20.56 --> 00:21:22.40 Every vet that I've talked to,
00:21:22.40 --> 00:21:30.32 from World War II, Vietnam, the guys that have served,
00:21:30.32 --> 00:21:33.12 and I rack in Afghanistan, everyone feels it.
00:21:35.92 --> 00:21:37.84 It's part of the deal. It's part of the job.
00:21:40.40 --> 00:21:42.64 It's part of the aftermath of war.
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:45.20 It's always existed.
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:51.84 And if you're feeling that,
00:21:55.68 --> 00:21:59.04 then you should know that you are not alone.
00:22:07.12 --> 00:22:11.12 What else do we learn from this speech?
00:22:11.12 --> 00:22:24.80 Well, another thing opens up a whole box, a whole Pandora's box of lessons learned.
00:22:24.80 --> 00:22:32.72 We're talking about urban combat and how fast things can unfold there.
00:22:32.72 --> 00:22:35.76 Urban combat is exceptionally stressful.
00:22:35.76 --> 00:22:41.52 The space-time continuum in urban combat is very compressed.
00:22:41.52 --> 00:22:46.000 The threats are 360 degrees. The enemy can be 500 meters away,
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.36 but they can also be 5 meters away.
00:22:50.16 --> 00:22:54.000 And one of the ways that we can mitigate that stress
00:22:54.80 --> 00:22:59.52 and thereby mitigate casualties and thereby mitigate the guilt
00:22:59.52 --> 00:23:07.28 that we all carry is by knowing and understanding that form of combat
00:23:07.28 --> 00:23:08.40 to the best of our ability.
00:23:11.76 --> 00:23:16.08 And as always, history has much to teach us.
00:23:19.36 --> 00:23:23.12 And I want to go now to a direct source.
00:23:23.12 --> 00:23:29.36 The leadership from Charlie I-5.
00:23:31.12 --> 00:23:34.000 Charlie Company, first battalion, fifth Marines,
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.96 Charlie I-5 fought in the Battle of Waysity.
00:23:38.72 --> 00:23:41.68 A brutal battle that took place during the TET offensive,
00:23:41.68 --> 00:23:47.12 Vietnam 1968, the battle lasted from January 30th to March 4th.
00:23:47.12 --> 00:23:52.40 It included 11 Arvin battalions for US Army Battalions,
00:23:52.40 --> 00:23:56.24 three US Marine Corps battalions, support from the Air Force,
00:23:57.84 --> 00:24:02.000 and they were fighting against the strength of about 10 enemy battalions.
00:24:02.88 --> 00:24:05.52 It was a massive battle and way,
00:24:07.44 --> 00:24:08.48 was a built-up city.
00:24:10.32 --> 00:24:14.32 It had a population of almost 150,000 people.
00:24:14.32 --> 00:24:20.88 It had typical urban terrain and also some unique terrain like the Citadel,
00:24:20.88 --> 00:24:23.68 which was a massive walled portion of the city.
00:24:25.44 --> 00:24:30.56 By the time it was over, the enemy had lost thousands of men killed,
00:24:30.56 --> 00:24:36.32 the South Vietnamese, had lost 452 men in America,
00:24:36.32 --> 00:24:46.000 suffered 216 men killed in action and 1,584 wounded in action.
00:24:46.80 --> 00:24:49.12 And here are some quotes from an interview
00:24:51.36 --> 00:24:55.36 from the digital journalist with a guy by the name of John Olson,
00:24:55.36 --> 00:24:58.16 an army combat photographer who is in
00:24:59.76 --> 00:25:04.16 way during this battle. He said, I was in way for five days.
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:08.32 I'd been in Vietnam for one year at this time.
00:25:09.68 --> 00:25:12.72 I'd seen a lot of battles and I thought I was pretty experienced,
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:14.80 but I'd never seen anything like way.
00:25:17.12 --> 00:25:20.72 There was tremendous bravery, a lot of dead.
00:25:22.80 --> 00:25:26.72 There was a situation in way where we had Marines in a courtyard.
00:25:26.72 --> 00:25:30.64 They had been moving from house to house and transitioning across this courtyard.
00:25:30.64 --> 00:25:33.36 They had rocketed.
00:25:35.20 --> 00:25:36.48 A lot of them were wounded.
00:25:37.76 --> 00:25:41.68 There was no radio contact. We were pinned down and in pretty bad shape.
00:25:43.20 --> 00:25:47.60 We had an element that eventually came into a leave us and had had a priest.
00:25:47.60 --> 00:25:51.36 And he gave last rights to the dead and he was a very generous priest.
00:25:53.36 --> 00:25:57.84 He offered to give the last rights to any of us that wanted them dead, wounded,
00:25:57.84 --> 00:26:00.72 or not scratched at that point.
00:26:02.56 --> 00:26:06.000 In context, it was such a horrific battle with such horrific images.
00:26:07.68 --> 00:26:08.48 Way was different.
00:26:10.56 --> 00:26:13.92 There were tremendous casualties and no way to treat them,
00:26:13.92 --> 00:26:15.28 no way to get them taken out.
00:26:18.08 --> 00:26:20.96 There were reports and as shown in this image,
00:26:20.96 --> 00:26:23.28 there was a Marine who was badly wounded.
00:26:23.28 --> 00:26:25.28 So badly he couldn't be treated.
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:28.72 Then he was zipped up in a body bag while he was still alive.
00:26:34.48 --> 00:26:35.52 That's what way was like.
00:26:37.60 --> 00:26:41.60 I was in way for five days and we were under heavy fire all the time.
00:26:43.84 --> 00:26:48.80 One of my favorite quotes was a journalist asking a Marine how many times he had been wounded in
00:26:48.80 --> 00:26:56.96 way and he said today sir.
00:26:59.44 --> 00:27:09.84 So it was a brutal battle and there was just incredible heroism and sacrifice and of course there
00:27:09.84 --> 00:27:10.88 were many lessons learned.
00:27:13.52 --> 00:27:18.56 And while the lessons focus on urban combat and they focus on the battle ways
00:27:18.56 --> 00:27:25.28 city, I think as you hear some of these lessons learned you'll see they apply broadly
00:27:26.40 --> 00:27:33.36 to leadership as a whole and as we know if we understand the way we can see it in all things.
00:27:34.16 --> 00:27:36.24 So let's go to this document.
00:27:36.24 --> 00:27:48.64 Lessons learned Charlie won five operation ways city 31 January 1968 to five March 1968.
00:27:48.96 --> 00:27:53.36 Even under the best of circumstances street fighting is a bloody business.
00:27:54.80 --> 00:27:59.92 This was in the end the ultimate lesson learned by the United States Marine Corps personnel
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:05.84 who participated in this historical battle, considered by many to be the bloodiest of the Vietnam War.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000 The Marine forces involved in Operation Way City lost 142 Marines killed an action during the
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.68 monthlong battle including the initial fierce clashes involving primarily fighting throughout the
00:28:19.68 --> 00:28:25.68 southern sections of the city and the climactic full-scale battles inside the Citadel fortress itself.
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:32.24 Hundreds more Marines were wounded and had to be met a fact on both sides of the river.
00:28:32.24 --> 00:28:36.48 Enemy casualties estimates range well into the thousands.
00:28:38.96 --> 00:28:43.60 Although Operation Way City will long be remembered as an overwhelming victory over the best
00:28:43.60 --> 00:28:47.76 conventional forces the enemy could throw at us and although the fifth Marines
00:28:47.76 --> 00:28:52.40 overcame very unfavorable odds and ultimately triumphed in the finest traditions of
00:28:52.40 --> 00:28:57.28 Marines in combat in truth this battle was a very close thing.
00:28:59.36 --> 00:29:07.12 At the squad, platoon and company levels, casualty rates were very severe as high as 75% or more
00:29:07.12 --> 00:29:14.40 in some units. This was especially true during the first day of day or two of each units
00:29:14.40 --> 00:29:24.96 initially experienced in full-scale urban combat. There's an important piece right there.
00:29:24.96 --> 00:29:31.12 During the first day or two of a unit going into combat, what does that mean? That means
00:29:31.12 --> 00:29:37.04 then that first day or two day or two you are learning a ton. That also means
00:29:37.04 --> 00:29:44.96 that if you can find out and figure out how to simulate that combat before you enter into those
00:29:44.96 --> 00:29:53.52 situations you'll be able to overcome or at least mitigate some of those initial shock
00:29:54.96 --> 00:29:58.40 things that happen that shock your system and you're not ready for them.
00:29:58.40 --> 00:30:04.08 And I talk about this with doing Jiu Jitsu for instance for females, right?
00:30:04.08 --> 00:30:11.68 If you're a female that wants to learn self-defense and you start training Jiu Jitsu.
00:30:11.68 --> 00:30:17.44 If you don't train Jiu Jitsu and some guy grabs a hold of you, you're in shock.
00:30:17.44 --> 00:30:21.28 You're not used to it. You have to contend with that
00:30:22.16 --> 00:30:27.52 something that you're on a costume too. If you train Jiu Jitsu, guess what? You have guys
00:30:27.52 --> 00:30:30.72 grabbing you every single day. They're grabbing you. They're grinding on you. They're trying to
00:30:30.72 --> 00:30:37.44 move you. You don't have to overcome that. Same thing with combat. The closer you can get to
00:30:38.40 --> 00:30:42.56 simulating what you're going to face in combat, the better you're going to do in combat.
00:30:42.56 --> 00:30:47.36 And you don't have to learn these horrible lessons your first entry. And you know, you and I've
00:30:47.36 --> 00:30:53.20 talked about this too. If you get, if let's say I learned a new move in Jiu Jitsu and I did it to you.
00:30:53.20 --> 00:31:01.28 You, you, I'd catch you. And then I show it to you. And now I'm saying I can't barely catch you anymore.
00:31:01.28 --> 00:31:05.68 Right? That's all it took. All it takes is you knowing and understanding. And it's the same
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:10.24 thing when we talk with businesses. And we do, we do roleplaying exercises as a leader.
00:31:10.24 --> 00:31:14.16 Yeah. And how do you talk? How do you tell someone that they need to improve their performance?
00:31:14.16 --> 00:31:17.92 You do a couple roleplays and you get good at their objections that they're going to give you
00:31:17.92 --> 00:31:22.56 where the reactions that they're going to have, you can get better. If you wait until the real thing,
00:31:24.08 --> 00:31:29.44 you're not doing yourself any favors. Yeah. It's kind of like an ambush, right? Like an
00:31:29.44 --> 00:31:35.68 ambush is so effective. But if you know the ambush is coming, exactly. It's not even effective at all.
00:31:35.68 --> 00:31:41.28 Yeah. And once you've been ambushed, like I imagine, I mean, it happens all the time. Any,
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:46.88 any time you, you know and understand what's going to happen, you're infinitely more equipped to handle
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:52.64 that thing. Yeah. As opposed to, I have no idea what's happening. And I'm going to go and figure it out
00:31:52.64 --> 00:32:01.44 on the fly. Yeah. So experience is the best, but guess what? Experience is expensive. It takes a lot of
00:32:01.44 --> 00:32:06.000 time. So what you have to do is you have to train. Yeah. That's what you have to do. What if the only
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.72 time you, what if you wanted to get good at street fighting? And the only time that you got to
00:32:10.72 --> 00:32:15.92 practice was when you got on a street fight. Yeah. Even if you literally went out every day and got
00:32:15.92 --> 00:32:19.52 in a street fight, two things would happen. Number one, you get arrested. But number two, you get all
00:32:19.52 --> 00:32:25.52 the first street fight, you might pick the wrong person and die. Yes. That is true. Right? Yeah.
00:32:27.36 --> 00:32:30.96 So what you want to do is you want to get into a training environment. Yes. And then you want to get
00:32:30.96 --> 00:32:36.72 yourself skilled. Yeah. Same thing with the military, same thing with fighting, same thing with
00:32:36.72 --> 00:32:40.56 shooting, same thing with business, anything that you're doing. It's another thing. I see like
00:32:40.56 --> 00:32:43.44 business people. There's business people that have been through, let's say, been through an
00:32:43.44 --> 00:32:50.08 acquisition before. They know what to expect their anticipating what's going on. And it makes them
00:32:50.08 --> 00:32:56.24 that better at forcing what's going to happen and mitigating the risk to it. How do you, if you
00:32:56.24 --> 00:33:01.84 can't go through the acquisition, what do you do? Read about them. You know, the interview people
00:33:01.84 --> 00:33:05.68 learn about them, figure out what to expect, but how you're someone on your team that has been
00:33:05.68 --> 00:33:13.68 through an acquisition before. So you get can capitalize on their experience. Yeah. It's crazy. I guess
00:33:13.68 --> 00:33:18.48 when you think about it, not crazy, but it's interesting. So you know, like sports teams, for example,
00:33:18.48 --> 00:33:25.04 like a, well, I guess football, say football for an example, you practice for like five or six days
00:33:25.60 --> 00:33:31.04 just practice practice practice practice. Two, sometimes more hours every single day, you know,
00:33:31.04 --> 00:33:36.72 maybe a day off, maybe. And then yeah, for one game. So it's like there's training, then there's
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:40.64 performance kind of thing. And they go kind of hand in hand, like you got a performance training,
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:46.64 and then you know, the game or whatever that you learned stuff during the game too. But it's,
00:33:46.64 --> 00:33:53.52 it's interesting where one game is predicated on so much training, so much training, but then
00:33:53.52 --> 00:33:59.20 when you go to work, it's like you kind of expect to have gone or they expect to or whatever,
00:33:59.20 --> 00:34:05.76 the expectation is that you went through your training already. And then they'll add sprinkles of training.
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:09.36 But you're talking about like a work, just normal work. Yeah, when you go to work. Yeah. Yeah.
00:34:09.36 --> 00:34:11.84 Yeah. All right. So everyone's from all you'll have a good. Well, that's,
00:34:12.80 --> 00:34:18.40 quite honestly, that's one of the recent Esslon, Esslon front is doing well because people are realizing
00:34:18.40 --> 00:34:22.48 that if you want your leaders to know how to lead, you actually have to train them how to lead. And
00:34:22.48 --> 00:34:28.96 that you can actually do that. Yeah. So that's one of the reasons that it's Esslon front
00:34:28.96 --> 00:34:37.52 is in such high demand because we can actually train your leaders to handle these situations that
00:34:37.52 --> 00:34:41.52 they're coming up against. And when you do that, you have this massive advantage. Yeah.
00:34:41.52 --> 00:34:46.72 And we see the companies that we work with, they, they, their, their performance just improves
00:34:47.36 --> 00:34:52.40 immensely because their leaders are working together and learning how to lead. And it's the most
00:34:52.40 --> 00:34:57.28 powerful thing you can have. Yeah. It's, it's weird because I, you know, I'm kind of behind the scenes
00:34:57.28 --> 00:35:01.52 guy with Esslon front and I see like, you know, any video that's been done, I probably seen it,
00:35:01.52 --> 00:35:07.20 you know, and I'm around, you know, all the time. So essentially, I'm getting the course too,
00:35:07.20 --> 00:35:13.60 you know. And it's interesting where I think probably in a lot of cases, I probably
00:35:13.60 --> 00:35:18.96 am more trained in it than most people, even most people companies that you work with or whatever,
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:22.96 because I'm kind of getting it second hand and listening because it applies to everyday life,
00:35:22.96 --> 00:35:27.52 you know, like this whole deal. It's not just work. It isn't. In fact, for me, I mean, yeah,
00:35:27.52 --> 00:35:34.64 it applies to my quote unquote work, but it applies to like family stuff, you know, wife stuff.
00:35:34.64 --> 00:35:39.44 And the big thing, this is the big thing, this is a big difference. You know the material,
00:35:40.16 --> 00:35:44.64 you, but you because of your position, you use it on your family, but you know,
00:35:44.64 --> 00:35:49.68 you use it in a work environment. And therefore, you get to learn the technique, but you don't
00:35:49.68 --> 00:35:55.12 get to roll, you don't get to spar. And here's the thing, when we work with companies,
00:35:55.12 --> 00:35:58.000 it's not like, oh, here's this information, and then they go apply it perfectly.
00:35:58.88 --> 00:36:02.72 No, they come back and say, hey, this didn't work. Yeah, I went and talked to Guy and he said,
00:36:02.72 --> 00:36:06.88 that's like, oh, okay, cool. Yeah, here's how you got to overcome that. So there's,
00:36:06.88 --> 00:36:12.32 you got to get the initial information. Yes, but you still have to apply it. Even if you train
00:36:12.32 --> 00:36:19.20 a group for combat, as much as you possibly can, they're still going to have a certain delta
00:36:19.20 --> 00:36:24.88 that they're going to need to rise to when the real failure. And so we see that with companies,
00:36:24.88 --> 00:36:31.20 we see that with individual leaders that are part of companies where they're, and I show up,
00:36:31.20 --> 00:36:34.80 sometimes, you know, there's some people out there that are just straight up in the game.
00:36:35.52 --> 00:36:40.56 And they're in the game before I even show up, like it's the icing on the cake,
00:36:40.56 --> 00:36:45.68 and even people that have red extreme ownership, 10 times they've red dichotomy of leadership,
00:36:45.68 --> 00:36:51.76 12 times they've listened to every single podcast, and they'll still ask questions about things,
00:36:52.32 --> 00:36:57.60 because they haven't quite put it together. Yeah, but like they haven't mapped it perfectly on
00:36:57.60 --> 00:37:02.24 their situation. Right. And just like I said, like it takes, it takes, like, okay, how you say,
00:37:02.80 --> 00:37:07.04 I don't really get to spar. I do get to spar, but they're real easy. Yeah. Super easy for an
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:12.40 person. What do I got? I got you. I got my wife, you know, you know, just coming to easy sparring
00:37:12.40 --> 00:37:16.64 partner, technically, yeah, for this stuff. It is. I mean, technically, you're the easiest one
00:37:16.64 --> 00:37:20.48 partner, because you're just like, you're doing the same thing. Yeah. And also, it's like,
00:37:20.48 --> 00:37:26.72 there's no friction. I mean, very little friction, maybe on some level. But that's a song.
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:34.48 But the, you know, these people at work when they apply it, when you don't, when you have a
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:38.96 whether it be a corporate job or whatever, you know, anytime where you have bigger teams, different
00:37:38.96 --> 00:37:44.08 personalities, you know, you care about, yes, on different levels. It's like, it takes way more. It takes
00:37:44.08 --> 00:37:51.12 more effort and more time on the mat. You know, people to get proficient to where you look at a situation.
00:37:51.12 --> 00:37:53.28 You go, oh, here's what this, here's the problem. Going to hear this guys, you go,
00:37:53.28 --> 00:37:56.08 you go, you go, you go to a little control, minimize, I just leave a little bit and let him have
00:37:56.08 --> 00:37:59.84 some more control. And that'll make him feel better and they'll do a better job. Like, it takes a
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:05.68 little bit of experience to get to that point. Yeah. And, and, you know, a lot of times, like I said,
00:38:05.68 --> 00:38:11.28 when we go and work with a company that this fully in the game, and they'll be bad, they'll be nailing
00:38:11.28 --> 00:38:14.96 nine out of ten things. And then they'll be one more thing that they need a little adjustment on,
00:38:14.96 --> 00:38:19.92 and they make that adjustment and they go, oh, yeah, you know, and everything makes sense. So
00:38:20.64 --> 00:38:29.44 training is how you get good. Don't waste your time getting beat up in street fights in order to learn.
00:38:29.44 --> 00:38:38.16 It doesn't make sense. All right, moving on. The ultimate success of this operation could have
00:38:38.16 --> 00:38:46.08 been significantly improved in our opinion by several factors, including one, improved less restrictive
00:38:46.08 --> 00:38:50.48 rules of engagement, including situational flexibility down to the platoon level. This is something
00:38:50.48 --> 00:38:58.24 we hear about all the time. Here's the deal. But what that really means is decentralized command,
00:38:58.24 --> 00:39:03.28 you need to trust your troops. You need to explain to them what is important and what is not.
00:39:03.28 --> 00:39:09.68 Rules of engagement to tell someone you cannot do this. What I'm saying, if I say echo,
00:39:10.80 --> 00:39:17.60 you cannot shoot at this type of building. If I tell you that, what I'm telling you is,
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:21.44 I don't trust you to make a good decision based on the information I give you. If I was to say,
00:39:21.44 --> 00:39:28.80 listen, some of these buildings that are marked with a star, those buildings are historical buildings
00:39:28.80 --> 00:39:34.80 that will cause the civilian populace to get angry at us. So don't shoot at them.
00:39:35.92 --> 00:39:41.20 If I say that to you and I say, tell you, explain to you why it's important. And then I say,
00:39:41.20 --> 00:39:45.76 hey, look, then again, remember you're in the field, you need to protect your men,
00:39:46.64 --> 00:39:50.80 and you say, God it. And now you go in the field and if you're a good leader and you trust me,
00:39:50.80 --> 00:39:55.12 and I trust you, and I've explained the commanders intent well, and you understand the strategic impact
00:39:55.84 --> 00:40:01.44 of disobeying or of going outside the rules that are not the rules, but the direction that I've given you,
00:40:02.16 --> 00:40:06.80 then you understand that? That's great. And you'll make a good decision because what that decision
00:40:06.80 --> 00:40:11.92 might entail is you're getting shot at from one of these buildings. And now you have to take it down.
00:40:11.92 --> 00:40:17.36 If I don't trust you to make that decision, what do I do? I put strict rules of engagement on you.
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:26.08 And now you can't do something. And that is not decentralized command. And it's not generally good.
00:40:26.08 --> 00:40:30.16 Do you have to put some broad rules in place? Yes, you absolutely do. But you have to make sure
00:40:30.16 --> 00:40:34.40 that the people on the ground understand that those rules can be bent if they have to and they
00:40:34.40 --> 00:40:40.88 have to have the authority in the leeway to do that. Next, two, improved communication of intelligence
00:40:40.88 --> 00:40:46.000 information to all levels of command. Of course, communicate communication is one of those things. And again,
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.12 I feel I always feel when we go to work with a company. It's one of the first things I have to ask
00:40:51.12 --> 00:40:55.76 is what are your methodology of communication through your company? How do you communicate with
00:40:55.76 --> 00:40:59.60 your front line trips? How do you communicate with your middle-level managers? How do your middle-level
00:40:59.60 --> 00:41:04.64 managers and your front line troops communicate with you? Because sometimes the front line troops might
00:41:04.64 --> 00:41:08.56 see something out on the battlefield that you don't see because you're up in the ivory tower.
00:41:09.76 --> 00:41:14.72 And how do they communicate that back to you? Do you have a methodology? Oftentimes,
00:41:14.72 --> 00:41:20.72 communication is ineffective or they don't have procedures around. They don't have protocols on
00:41:20.72 --> 00:41:25.68 how to communicate. That's bad. So communication up and down the chain of command,
00:41:26.56 --> 00:41:31.60 simple, clear and concise. That's the way it's got to be. Three, acquisition of improved intelligence
00:41:31.60 --> 00:41:37.44 data in particular concerning the disposition and size of enemy forces. That's cool. That's a
00:41:37.44 --> 00:41:45.28 little bit of a universal fantasy for military people that we want great intelligence. We want
00:41:45.28 --> 00:41:51.36 to know the enemy is. If we knew where the enemy is, our job is to be a lot easier. Yeah. So that's a
00:41:51.36 --> 00:41:56.08 universal fantasy. And we should always strive to achieve that fantasy, but it's very difficult to get to.
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:00.80 But then they go to this, reconnaissance and small unit probes to fix enemy positions are critical.
00:42:00.80 --> 00:42:05.28 What that means is when you want intelligence, go get it. Go find it.
00:42:05.28 --> 00:42:13.44 Gather the intel yourself as much as you can. For improved supporting fire plan access to our
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:18.40 artillery naval gunfire, direct fire from armored vehicles and air support should be judiciously
00:42:18.40 --> 00:42:24.88 employed. Duploied. So where does that mean we need to cover? We need to cover from big guns.
00:42:24.88 --> 00:42:31.60 Covered move. Five significantly increased training for urban conflict, street fighting,
00:42:31.60 --> 00:42:37.84 practice and preparation. I think we just covered that training is always paramount.
00:42:38.56 --> 00:42:44.40 Six deployment of available chemical weapons in this case tear gas for offensive operations
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:50.000 during early stages of the operation. These guys use tear gas and it worked well.
00:42:51.84 --> 00:42:58.80 The North Vietnamese army had didn't have gas masks and they didn't like it.
00:42:58.80 --> 00:43:06.08 Yeah, no. Of course, you know there's people when you say chemical weapons, what do we think of?
00:43:06.08 --> 00:43:10.56 We think a mustard gas. There's other, you know there's nerve agents in nerve gas. That's what
00:43:10.56 --> 00:43:16.08 people generally think of when you think of chemical weapons. But chemical weapons are also
00:43:17.04 --> 00:43:22.24 tear gas. And tear gas can be very effective. There's also some people that can just be
00:43:22.24 --> 00:43:36.16 ETF through tear gas. Continuing. Seven improved dissemination of operational plan details down
00:43:36.16 --> 00:43:46.80 to the fire team level. Fire team leaders. These fire team that leaders. If the fire team leaders
00:43:46.80 --> 00:43:49.68 and you're talking about someone that's in charge of foreguys or six guys or something like that,
00:43:49.68 --> 00:43:55.12 really small little element. If those people understand what you're trying to accomplish as a team,
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.28 that means they can execute at their level and make things happen. They can move the ball in the
00:44:01.28 --> 00:44:06.08 right direction. If they don't know where they're supposed to be going, guess what? They can't help you.
00:44:07.04 --> 00:44:14.40 They can't help you. So broad guidance needs to be given. It needs to be updated. People need to
00:44:14.40 --> 00:44:18.96 understand, hey, we're trying to move forward. We're trying to take this area. We're trying to move
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:26.24 across this line. Everyone needs to understand that. If they don't understand that, they're actually
00:44:26.24 --> 00:44:32.16 no good to you. If you go to fire team leader out on the flank somewhere that has no idea that you're
00:44:32.16 --> 00:44:37.60 trying to move forward or move east or west or north, that person is just sitting there waiting
00:44:37.60 --> 00:44:43.12 for you to tell them what to do. They're almost worthless. So, and this also means if you're
00:44:43.12 --> 00:44:47.04 a fire team leader, and you don't know if you're supposed to be going north of east or west or whatever,
00:44:47.04 --> 00:44:50.72 you should be raising your hand and saying, hey, what are we doing? Tell me what we're doing.
00:44:53.76 --> 00:44:59.84 Continuing on the other side of the scale, small unit experience, individual marine determination,
00:44:59.84 --> 00:45:05.04 the buddy system, the quick learning capacity of Marines under combat conditions,
00:45:05.04 --> 00:45:11.36 the combined leadership officers, staff, and CEOs, and NCOs of one five at all levels, and the
00:45:11.36 --> 00:45:16.08 ultimate ability to coordinate fire support and execute street fighting tactics under heavy fire
00:45:16.08 --> 00:45:21.44 were factors that won this pivotal battle despite incredible odds, high casualty rates,
00:45:21.44 --> 00:45:30.24 and the resulting turnover of officers and NCOs. So, it comes down to your individual
00:45:30.24 --> 00:45:39.04 Marines and your front line leadership that make these things happen. Which, no doubt, the military,
00:45:39.04 --> 00:45:44.32 the US military is awesome in their front line leadership and their front line troops.
00:45:45.04 --> 00:45:51.84 They make so many things happen. Even in many cases, despite poor leadership, you just have great
00:45:51.84 --> 00:45:56.24 front line leadership. I mean, I would say that a lot, you know, you get a platoon that had
00:45:56.24 --> 00:46:01.52 kind of a marginal, and if not, maybe even a bad platoon commander, but you just get some guys
00:46:01.52 --> 00:46:07.20 in that platoon that are awesome. The platoon would be awesome. As long as the leader was humble enough
00:46:07.20 --> 00:46:12.000 to take guidance. If the leader wasn't humble enough to take guidance, they would fail,
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000 because he would just drag everyone in his terrible ways down. If he had the common sense to say,
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.12 you know what I'm going to listen to these guys? I'm going to let them kind of run with it.
00:46:21.12 --> 00:46:28.000 Patoon would do fine. Continuing on, certainly using 2020 perspective of hindsight,
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.56 this battle could have been decided even more timely and decisive fashion reducing friendly
00:46:32.56 --> 00:46:36.64 casualty rates in the process by paying attention to the fundamentals of planning Marine
00:46:36.64 --> 00:46:43.12 operations. Proper prior planning prevents piss-pour performance, and they actually edited out piss
00:46:44.40 --> 00:46:52.72 because they're squared away Marines. Yeah, got to come up with a good plan and had they done
00:46:52.72 --> 00:47:01.44 that better. This is a typical situation. Hindsight's always 2020. And I always avoid becoming a
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:11.92 armchair post-game critic. In the military. I mean, I'll criticize someone like a fighter in the
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:19.84 UFC or whatever, but when it comes to military operations, it's really easy to sit back and
00:47:19.84 --> 00:47:25.92 throw darts and say, well, you know, I would have done this. You weren't there. You didn't see it.
00:47:25.92 --> 00:47:30.80 I didn't see it. I wasn't in the situation. I have all the facts now they didn't have those facts.
00:47:30.80 --> 00:47:37.92 Yeah. Most very cautious about hooking darts into the past. And you deal with that
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:44.08 situation. You kind of use it. You actually do. You use this as, even when you say you can sit back
00:47:44.08 --> 00:47:50.72 and be a tactical genius. I would ever say yes. If I make a video, you can sit back and be like,
00:47:51.28 --> 00:47:58.16 look at these like 10 mistakes or 10 things or whatever. Meanwhile, there's like a thousand elements.
00:47:58.16 --> 00:48:04.24 So, 990 elements have that to be created well and work and all this stuff. And then you can just
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:07.68 be like, yeah, those, because essentially, those are created for you. You know, you don't have to
00:48:07.68 --> 00:48:12.48 create those things. All you have to do is poke holes in the tent. Yeah. I can focus instead of having
00:48:12.48 --> 00:48:17.44 to focus on a thousand things. I can take a broader look and see the 10 things that you screwed up.
00:48:17.44 --> 00:48:22.24 Yeah, or one thing. Or all of that. No, no, no, in my case, like, probably just one. Maybe two.
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:27.28 All right. The following details regarding the lessons learned from Operation Wasted
00:48:27.28 --> 00:48:31.84 are offered from the former members of Charlie Company, First Battalion Fifth Marine Regiment,
00:48:31.84 --> 00:48:36.16 First Marine Division, who served in combat during Operation Wasted City and who were directly
00:48:36.16 --> 00:48:41.84 involved in the battle with NVA forces inside the Citadel fortress from 13 February 1968 through
00:48:41.84 --> 00:48:49.28 five March 1968. Situation terrain. There is an infinite variety of possible landscapes that
00:48:49.28 --> 00:48:54.56 may be confronted by a Marine force given the mission of attacking an enemy force in urban terrain.
00:48:54.56 --> 00:49:03.20 Infinite variety of possible landscapes. What does that remind me of? That reminds me of
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:11.28 life itself. Hmm. When the tent offensive broke out on 31 January 1968 and conventional
00:49:11.28 --> 00:49:16.72 NVA forces overran major sections of the largest cities in South Vietnam, Marine forces were
00:49:16.72 --> 00:49:22.64 literally knee deep in rice patties in jungle mud. Since first establishing a beach head in
00:49:22.64 --> 00:49:28.72 1965, Marines had been assigned the mission of conducting a counter insurgency, a rural conflict,
00:49:28.72 --> 00:49:35.36 fighting for the most part of guerrilla army. The tent offensive changed all of that and for the
00:49:35.36 --> 00:49:41.92 first time since the height of the Korean War in 1954, Marines found themselves with a mission that
00:49:41.92 --> 00:49:53.36 involved urban combat. You have to be able to never turn your back on something. I had a fighter
00:49:53.36 --> 00:50:02.48 I was training for a fight and I was like, hey, let's do some groundwork. You know, with you on the
00:50:02.48 --> 00:50:10.64 bottom and the dude was strong. It wasn't a good wrestler. Well, let me say a decent wrestler, but not
00:50:10.64 --> 00:50:16.48 by any stretch, you know, not a competitive college wrestler or anything like that, but solid, strong,
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:23.68 very strong. I said, hey, man, let's put you on the bottom and the response was, I'm not going to
00:50:23.68 --> 00:50:31.20 be on the bottom. Good. Yeah. Hey, well, even if you don't think you're going to be on the bottom,
00:50:31.20 --> 00:50:36.32 let's train for the unlikely event that you happen to end up on the bottom because it's a fight
00:50:36.32 --> 00:50:42.40 and anything can happen. I don't need to. I'm not going to be on the bottom. So we can tell where
00:50:42.40 --> 00:50:46.96 the story is going. Yeah. You went to his fight and fought and was on the bottom basically the
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:50.96 whole fight. It was a free round fight. It was on the bottom on this whole time. So it was horrible.
00:50:50.96 --> 00:50:58.64 Yeah. And why? Because you can't, you can't neglect one part of the possibilities that can unfold.
00:50:59.20 --> 00:51:05.12 And even even for us, when we would get ready to deploy to Iraq, we're going to Iraq,
00:51:05.12 --> 00:51:10.56 we're literally going to a desert and going to be in the middle of the desert. And we would still
00:51:10.56 --> 00:51:16.72 do dive operations. We'd still do maritime operations while we were getting ready to deploy. Why?
00:51:16.72 --> 00:51:20.32 Because we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know whether what next war is going to break out.
00:51:21.12 --> 00:51:30.56 So just don't neglect anything. And I'll tell you what else. If you're good at a variety of things,
00:51:30.56 --> 00:51:37.60 you will be better at everything. So if all we knew how to do is enter rooms. What happens when
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:43.92 when we enter a building instead of being a bunch of rooms is a giant warehouse. So it needs to be
00:51:43.92 --> 00:51:48.96 clear. Like, you got to think about these things. But the more flexible you are, the more capabilities
00:51:48.96 --> 00:51:53.20 you have, that's what I'm looking for. The more capabilities you have, the more flexibility you have.
00:51:53.20 --> 00:52:04.16 So learn different skill sets. Don't neglect things. Continuing on preparing to remove an enemy
00:52:04.16 --> 00:52:09.04 battalion that is captured a 40-story skyscraper, a college campus is much different than
00:52:09.04 --> 00:52:13.92 always a much different mission than getting the enemy squad out of a house school or church in a
00:52:13.92 --> 00:52:20.000 small town. The common factor in all these variations, however, is that in all cases, in urban combat
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.96 structures dominate the terrain. Studying and assessing terrain is a fundamental issue for marine
00:52:26.96 --> 00:52:36.24 commanders when planning mission. This idea of terrain is so important. The way the advantage
00:52:36.24 --> 00:52:44.88 that terrain gives you is, I don't know what to compare it to in other in anything else. If you
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:52.72 understand terrain, you can dominate. It's like trying to do due to a not understanding arm position.
00:52:53.44 --> 00:52:57.20 Like, where that you need underhooks. If you're going against people, I don't understand
00:52:57.20 --> 00:53:01.84 unhooks, you will destroy them. If you're going to get someone that doesn't understand
00:53:02.72 --> 00:53:06.88 where to position their hands, where to position their arms, you will destroy them. If you're
00:53:06.88 --> 00:53:10.96 going against someone that doesn't understand how to utilize a terrain, you will destroy them.
00:53:10.96 --> 00:53:16.000 If you don't know how to utilize the terrain, you will get destroyed. And by the way, that doesn't
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.04 matter if you're in the city or in rural environment, doesn't matter where you are.
00:53:24.24 --> 00:53:28.16 Studying and assessing terrain is a fundamental issue from marine commanders when planning missions.
00:53:28.16 --> 00:53:32.48 This is even more critical in planning house-to-house combat operations. Building materials
00:53:32.48 --> 00:53:37.20 very worldwide and their ability to provide small arms cover to a very high degree.
00:53:37.20 --> 00:53:41.76 Through the use of reconnaissance and intelligence, we recommend conducting a serious assessment
00:53:41.76 --> 00:53:46.000 of each building or structure that is within your unit's area of operations.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.48 Because tactics involved in taking each objective, building, structure, etc.
00:53:51.04 --> 00:53:56.16 Maybe different in each case. A small wood frame house may offer the illusion of cover
00:53:56.16 --> 00:54:01.28 from small arms, fire, but little else. In some places, walls are paper thin.
00:54:01.28 --> 00:54:05.52 Even houses that use some form of plaster or concrete construction can prove to be
00:54:05.52 --> 00:54:15.28 unexpectedly porous and at the worst possible times. This is something to consider all the time.
00:54:16.80 --> 00:54:20.24 Things are not always what they seem. That's what's important there.
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:25.68 Things are not always what they seem. You think you're hiding behind a wall and now you're safe.
00:54:25.68 --> 00:54:32.64 No, bullets will go right through it. Continuing, know the basic layout of a structure as
00:54:32.64 --> 00:54:38.80 much as possible before entry. This is something that I would say our standard operating procedures
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:44.48 in the US military now are so good that we don't really need to know the layout of a structure.
00:54:45.28 --> 00:54:51.76 We're going to go in and be able to handle whatever the structure, however the structure is laid out.
00:54:51.76 --> 00:55:00.72 That's what we do. If you don't train to enter rooms regularly and you don't train to enter buildings
00:55:00.72 --> 00:55:05.04 and you don't train to be able to contend with all these varieties of things that you could face,
00:55:05.04 --> 00:55:09.52 you won't be able to. If you try and say, okay, we need to know what the building looks like inside
00:55:09.52 --> 00:55:14.32 before you go in there that's a horrible idea. It's not going to happen. And by the way, when you go
00:55:14.32 --> 00:55:18.000 in there, the first thing you're going to come across is a barricade. When you can't go down the hallway
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.64 and you've got to go through these other rooms that you weren't expecting. Continuing, approaching
00:55:24.64 --> 00:55:29.68 structure with an entry plan and a search plan and make sure each member of the fire team in
00:55:29.68 --> 00:55:34.72 squad is well versed in these plans. What I say instead of that, it's not plans. These are standard operating
00:55:34.72 --> 00:55:38.24 procedures. You develop standard operating procedures so you know what to do when you end
00:55:38.24 --> 00:55:44.40 rebuilding and so does everyone on the team. Establish voice codes and commands and communicate
00:55:44.40 --> 00:55:50.40 regularly with each other. Yes. Consider entry ways, existing doors and windows to be extremely
00:55:50.40 --> 00:55:55.28 dangerous, likely locations for Ruby traps and to be avoided if at all possible. Wherever possible,
00:55:55.28 --> 00:56:00.40 blow entry holes using satchel charges or rockets. Once the entry plan is finalized and understood,
00:56:00.40 --> 00:56:07.36 it must be executed with fierce determination. Be prepared for anything and be ready to improvise.
00:56:08.96 --> 00:56:14.08 Be systematic and check everything basements sewer, access, add-X rooftop trash cans,
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:18.56 thoroughly before establishing that the objective is secure. So what I want the most important
00:56:18.56 --> 00:56:25.12 things I take away from that is that the existing entry ways you got to consider them dangerous.
00:56:26.48 --> 00:56:33.36 How do we translate that into life? What that means is these well-established patterns are exactly
00:56:33.36 --> 00:56:40.88 that and I'm not saying you can't ever use a pattern that someone else used but you at least at a
00:56:40.88 --> 00:56:46.48 minimum have to be aware of the fact that when you're doing something, when you're using a path
00:56:46.48 --> 00:56:55.76 that someone else is already gone down, it's a known path. So you can't expect to be able to surprise
00:56:55.76 --> 00:56:59.76 your competitor when you're doing something that's always been done the same way. Go to.
00:56:59.76 --> 00:57:05.28 Think of how you can approach things in a different manner and if in fact that manner might be
00:57:05.28 --> 00:57:10.24 better. Sometimes you look at things from a different angle and you realize that the reason that
00:57:10.24 --> 00:57:14.88 everyone does it this way is because that's the best possible way and to make some huge
00:57:14.88 --> 00:57:20.08 hurty lean effort to try and do something to just to be different sometimes that's the wrong answer.
00:57:20.08 --> 00:57:27.68 I get that but consider it. Yeah a lot of times those the sweet and like certain industries are
00:57:27.68 --> 00:57:33.12 like this but I'm gonna name them but they're so used to doing it a certain way because that's
00:57:33.12 --> 00:57:37.92 sort of like what they learned. Yeah it's all for sure. It's almost like as an industry they don't
00:57:37.92 --> 00:57:43.04 think of like what why they're doing it that way. Well yeah that's why that's why there's been
00:57:43.04 --> 00:57:49.36 so many disruptors right in the last few years. I mean you can look at any of these
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:54.48 disruptors companies that are come out of nowhere that you know you can look at the
00:57:54.48 --> 00:58:00.88 ride sharing applications. If you were a taxi driver you were thinking okay how can we get more
00:58:00.88 --> 00:58:06.40 dispatchers how can I hire more cars. These you know these ride sharing people said oh we're not
00:58:06.40 --> 00:58:15.20 gonna own any cars. Same with Airbnb right we're not gonna build a hotel we're gonna use a random
00:58:15.20 --> 00:58:20.80 people's houses and put you in there that's looking at it from a completely different angle.
00:58:21.92 --> 00:58:26.24 Seeing a problem and coming up with a completely different solution if you looked at a city and said oh
00:58:26.24 --> 00:58:30.80 wow there's no rooms in that city there's no hotel rooms in that city where am I gonna put
00:58:30.80 --> 00:58:36.80 everyone okay well let's do whatever one else does. We'll build a building and we'll put rooms in there
00:58:36.80 --> 00:58:41.28 and we'll staff the building and we'll put a restaurant. That's what you do. That's what's been done.
00:58:41.84 --> 00:58:47.36 Guess what? Someone else looked at that and said you know there's nowhere to stay in that city
00:58:48.32 --> 00:58:53.52 but some people might have empty rooms in their house. Let's let's see if we can access those.
00:58:53.52 --> 00:58:57.68 Yeah boom there you go. Yeah I wonder how it was that where the guy would want to look at you
00:58:57.68 --> 00:59:03.12 like hey shoot I can't find a hotel room when I go to San Francisco and then the friend was like hey
00:59:03.12 --> 00:59:08.08 just come say with me. And then when he stayed with them he was like you know next time you come
00:59:08.08 --> 00:59:12.56 if you can't find a hotel room you can always stay with me. But I call yeah hey I'm not the only one
00:59:12.56 --> 00:59:17.84 right away I'm coming up here I'm coming up on you know my company's pay me come up here so
00:59:17.84 --> 00:59:21.84 I can get them you know they'll give me money for the room so maybe I could just pay you. Yeah
00:59:21.84 --> 00:59:27.44 and you go oh cool we're kind of kind of getting a little help us kick back for the company. Yeah cool and
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:33.04 then the next thing you know hey I bet other cities have I know a guy down the road he has room
00:59:33.04 --> 00:59:37.84 because really you so if you have any co-workers or no and if you know anybody you know that guy too
00:59:37.84 --> 00:59:45.36 oh simple as that yeah simple as that but it's looking at it from a different angle
00:59:45.36 --> 00:59:51.84 so look at things from a different angle then what you come up you know fierce determination
00:59:51.84 --> 00:59:56.88 fierce determination is always good yeah makes sense there are dichotomy it's a fierce determination
00:59:56.88 --> 01:00:02.80 yes there is can you have someone that's two fierce lead determination. First lead determined yes you can
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:14.88 yes you can they don't know when to stop me next the other aspect of urban terrain are the
01:00:14.88 --> 01:00:20.08 spaces between building streets alleys and other pathways are normal routes for humans and therefore
01:00:20.08 --> 01:00:28.56 must be suspected to be under observation and possible enemy firing lanes whenever possible
01:00:28.56 --> 01:00:34.24 take the most difficult route from house to house same thing we just talked about look for a different path
01:00:36.08 --> 01:00:41.60 established and then and there's obviously there's a dichotomy to that because if you're constantly
01:00:41.60 --> 01:00:45.84 just taking a hard road all the time you might not make any progress it's also bad.
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:50.80 establishing advanced a plan of what to do and the event non-combatants are found in urban zones
01:00:51.92 --> 01:00:55.60 and from marking buildings that have been cleared it's kind of crazy that they didn't have
01:00:55.60 --> 01:01:02.24 an idea of how they were going to mark buildings that were cleared. Continuing make absolutely
01:01:02.24 --> 01:01:07.28 sure that your Marines are aware that while inside of building being secured they are at risk
01:01:07.28 --> 01:01:14.64 from both within and without always assume that every room of every floor in each and every house
01:01:14.64 --> 01:01:20.24 contains enemy soldiers always move very quickly when moving in front of windows or
01:01:20.24 --> 01:01:25.44 doorways always know where enemy positions may be in buildings that are adjacent to yours
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:31.92 as in all marine operations watching your buddies back watch your buddies back and run as fast as
01:01:31.92 --> 01:01:41.04 possible when traversing open ground can't let your guard down. Can't let your guard down.
01:01:43.04 --> 01:01:49.36 Where do you let your guard down? Yeah. Can't tell you. It's probably a pretty broad area.
01:01:50.24 --> 01:01:57.76 100% of my life. Is there any time where you feel like hey I need to get my guard up?
01:01:57.76 --> 01:02:03.92 This is probably an easier question for you. You're not just running around hyper paranoid like I am.
01:02:03.92 --> 01:02:11.28 Yeah. Yeah. What? In life? You mean or in GG2? Like everything? Yeah. Like oh,
01:02:11.28 --> 01:02:18.000 I don't know. It put it this way my guard's always up but it's only kind of up. I think you know it's like a
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.40 25% and it flak kind of fluctuates from moment to moment. Luxuates up from like zero.
01:02:24.40 --> 01:02:30.72 It stays at 25 sometimes it goes up to like 30. Yeah. Certain scenarios. Yeah. Check.
01:02:30.72 --> 01:02:35.60 Multiple story structures present in even greater challenge in single story buildings in medium-sized
01:02:35.60 --> 01:02:40.56 village or town or small city that is dominated by one two and three story buildings be very
01:02:40.56 --> 01:02:45.20 particular about the taller buildings which are naturally used by the enemy as high ground.
01:02:46.72 --> 01:02:51.76 If possible make entry to taller multi-level buildings via the roof and works systematically
01:02:51.76 --> 01:02:58.56 and thoroughly downward always look for the high ground. So is that the thing you know because
01:02:58.56 --> 01:03:06.08 yeah the high ground kind of seems simple straightforward or whatever but is there like a
01:03:06.08 --> 01:03:13.68 blueprint like a simple blueprint for like I remember you told me a story where your son was talking
01:03:13.68 --> 01:03:18.64 with like a neighbor or something who had I don't know if you want to Vietnam or something like
01:03:18.64 --> 01:03:22.72 he was in using the military whatever and you get and they played like laser tag or something
01:03:22.72 --> 01:03:29.52 and you sound like whooped him because he knew like something. Well yeah my son knew some fundamental
01:03:29.52 --> 01:03:35.36 tactics. His own energy younger so he wasn't really up to speed yet he was like seven or six
01:03:36.08 --> 01:03:40.16 but you know not up to us. We started you know he was he was already through I think
01:03:41.04 --> 01:03:44.000 I think it was through level seven of my tactical course
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.36 um yeah he's probably around level seven. What tactical course just I have like some tactical lessons
01:03:51.36 --> 01:03:57.28 that I run you know what I mean that you run like as a father or as a what like echelon front
01:03:57.28 --> 01:04:01.52 has a tactical course like what do you know I have tactical concepts that I teach.
01:04:01.52 --> 01:04:07.20 How do you teach? Well I can't teach me nothing. You know you're all being over there 25%
01:04:08.56 --> 01:04:13.28 because you know that's just the standard you know if you know so there's certain things you have to learn
01:04:13.28 --> 01:04:19.20 in order to be attacked to be proficient and I my son had learned like I'd gone through seven of the
01:04:19.84 --> 01:04:28.56 courses to understand the tactical things and there was a friend of my wife's friend came over.
01:04:28.56 --> 01:04:36.40 He yes he was prior uh Marine actually he was active duty Marine and yes my son challenged him to a
01:04:36.40 --> 01:04:44.24 laser tag competition and yes my son was victorious three times in a row and in the
01:04:44.24 --> 01:04:48.96 he just did simple fundamental tactics and it wasn't even team at sporters one on one.
01:04:49.68 --> 01:04:56.000 So how do you defeat someone one on one? Well you maneuver very quickly you don't fire from the
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.52 same same position multiple times you get the high ground because you like he knew if you get
01:05:03.52 --> 01:05:10.000 onto my garage roof which had access with a ladder you're gonna be able to defend that position
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.60 very thoroughly and the person that's below you because all you have to do when you're on the
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:19.36 garage roof is dark and you're hidden it's a parapet roof so you're all you if there's a deck up
01:05:19.36 --> 01:05:23.84 there yeah there's one access point how are you gonna beat me you don't have grenades with the
01:05:23.84 --> 01:05:30.08 late you don't laser grenades so I have the high ground yeah I'm seven years old or six years old
01:05:30.08 --> 01:05:35.28 I have the high ground I have a laser weapon you're trying to attack me you're gonna die yeah and then
01:05:35.28 --> 01:05:40.96 the next round when you're trying to get up on that thing I'm not there anymore yeah I'm in the alley
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:47.12 way up the alley way up behind the fence higher still higher still so the high ground is kind of like
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:54.48 the golden go through yeah interesting you know when the first time I found out that the high ground
01:05:54.48 --> 01:06:00.48 is the spot to be where when I watch the movie called the rock you're watching a song Connor in
01:06:00.48 --> 01:06:05.36 Nickle's Gate where the Navy seals come up you know they got to go to Alcatraz they come up through
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:10.16 the wherever the dream there's something like this yeah and they get you know boom they're
01:06:10.16 --> 01:06:16.40 sort of surprised by the I think they're Marines yeah the Terry they're mercenaries at this point
01:06:16.40 --> 01:06:22.96 but nonetheless or Patriots depend. Patriots right exactly right yeah and he was like hey your
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:28.24 guys just surrounded it from an elevated position yeah it's kind of like this is a no-brainer you
01:06:28.24 --> 01:06:34.64 know this kind of thing like that's a thing yeah and it is a thing you know how and they and they
01:06:34.64 --> 01:06:43.44 killed them all yeah except for Nicholas Cage he didn't die that's that's chemical agent by the way
01:06:43.44 --> 01:06:48.88 right Vx guys that's that's what I was gonna say yeah but you know that was a real or you
01:06:48.88 --> 01:06:54.64 all right yeah let's face it's president just dive deep right into that I was gonna let me know
01:06:54.64 --> 01:07:01.44 this little pearl the little pearl balls they're kind of yeah interesting back to the book
01:07:03.28 --> 01:07:08.40 the mission assigned to Marine forces during Operation Away City was to remove enemy forces that
01:07:08.40 --> 01:07:14.000 it captured major sections of the ancient imperial capital of way during the surprise and VA offensive
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000 that was quickly dubbed the Tad Offensive due to the historic listen closely due to the historic
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.52 aspect of many of the buildings in way the usage of heavy weapons was significantly restricted
01:07:25.52 --> 01:07:31.84 during the initial days of fighting on both sides of the river as friendly casualties mounted
01:07:31.84 --> 01:07:38.08 and as initial estimates of the size of the enemy force in a way city area was significantly
01:07:38.08 --> 01:07:45.92 increased fire restrictions were ultimately lifted so they didn't want to damage these historical
01:07:45.92 --> 01:07:50.40 buildings and so they said hey don't don't use 50 cal don't use group whatever whatever
01:07:51.60 --> 01:07:57.68 weapons they said they couldn't use and then eventually when the casualties got so bad they said
01:07:57.68 --> 01:08:04.80 okay go ahead and do what you got to do I say rip the bandade off right if you're gonna go
01:08:04.80 --> 01:08:14.000 you go if you're gonna go go don't play around that's a good lesson America learns over and
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.04 over and over again if you're gonna go to war go to win your number one priority over everything
01:08:19.04 --> 01:08:23.28 else should be doing and by the way if they would have done that I guarantee this city would have
01:08:23.28 --> 01:08:28.96 been a better shape at the end because the enemy is gonna drag this thing out and it's gonna take
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:34.96 longer than you're gonna have to end up destroying every single building that's there yeah make sense they
01:08:34.96 --> 01:08:40.48 continue in our respectful opinion our ability to successfully complete the mission was initially
01:08:40.48 --> 01:08:46.16 severely impacted by the rules of engagement again this is a lack of trust up and down the chain
01:08:46.16 --> 01:08:51.36 equipment if I have to impose strict rules of engagement on my people I haven't trained them well
01:08:51.36 --> 01:08:56.64 enough I don't trust them they don't trust me they don't understand the strategic mission
01:08:56.64 --> 01:09:05.36 and we have a real problem continuing although it is understood that mission and rules
01:09:05.36 --> 01:09:09.92 engagement are not the exclusive responsibility of marine leadership at the cartoon company
01:09:09.92 --> 01:09:15.04 battalion or even regimental level it is strongly recommended that every effort is made at
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:21.20 every level in the chain of command to ensure that balance has been achieved between the demands
01:09:21.20 --> 01:09:26.08 of the mission and the effect of the rules of engagement on the ability of the command to
01:09:26.08 --> 01:09:35.20 perform the mission successfully yes you do have to have balance but what you really should have
01:09:35.20 --> 01:09:43.44 is trust and understanding of the situation so that people don't need to be constrained by rules
01:09:45.84 --> 01:09:50.32 if I have if my leaders understand what I want them to do
01:09:50.32 --> 01:09:55.92 and they understand the constraints and they understand the mission and they understand the
01:09:55.92 --> 01:10:01.84 impact they don't need any rules at all they just need to get told to go yeah I think about
01:10:01.84 --> 01:10:08.80 like certain laws where if this is going to be the law the land that this law applies to
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:12.16 everybody same thing with rules of engagement where they got it because they kind of got
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:18.96 applied to everyone right in a certain way so that's why they wind up being so strict or they can
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:24.80 and I'm thinking about laws too where there's certain groups or individuals that's like man
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:29.68 that law kind of shouldn't apply to me because I know better you know but where like you know
01:10:29.68 --> 01:10:34.64 like the guy who's like okay on quiet is this red light right this is or this stop light
01:10:34.64 --> 01:10:41.60 not quite where the cross road of that stop light is a dirt road and on both and if you turn
01:10:41.60 --> 01:10:45.92 in the dirt road either direction there's a gate that's always closed it's only click hope that
01:10:45.92 --> 01:10:50.32 it's for like cane trucks and stuff or it was I don't know what it is down but and the cane
01:10:50.32 --> 01:10:54.08 truck guys have the key to the gate there's big long get you can't even turn in there but there's
01:10:54.08 --> 01:11:00.80 still a stop light right so it's never red because it only turns green when the kid but
01:11:00.80 --> 01:11:04.80 everyone's gonna all be red and the gate will be closed you know you know that sort of happens
01:11:05.52 --> 01:11:09.52 and here's the thing you can see the gate's quote no truck is coming even if a truck was
01:11:09.52 --> 01:11:14.16 coming like they got a stop that opened the gate whatever should you stay at that red stop light
01:11:14.16 --> 01:11:20.88 or can you just blow through the light you would think any responsible adult should have
01:11:21.76 --> 01:11:27.60 the authority or whatever to see that and just go through the light right but the rules got
01:11:27.60 --> 01:11:31.92 applied everybody that's the thing has to apply to everyone what about the new driver who's like
01:11:32.56 --> 01:11:40.80 they can discern quite as well where a safe red light running situation versus a not so safe red
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:45.52 light running situation and then there's a spectrum you know so when these rules get put in place
01:11:45.52 --> 01:11:52.40 they gotta apply to everybody the lowest common denominator person and unfortunately these highest
01:11:52.40 --> 01:11:59.60 higher denominational people gotta apply to them too because you know you can't just go down
01:11:59.60 --> 01:12:03.76 the line and be like okay this rule applies to you but kind of kind of you know just maybe 30
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:09.28 percent this rule applies to him 100 percent of course and him too you 1 percent because you're
01:12:09.28 --> 01:12:13.84 this elite dude so you can you know you have ultimate like you know it's hard to do that
01:12:13.84 --> 01:12:17.76 especially when you do a like a bunch of people so that's why that can be a pain and that sometimes
01:12:18.48 --> 01:12:21.92 you seem to say you're apparently that's been bothered you for quite some well
01:12:21.92 --> 01:12:27.36 how long you live in America for or on this main land like think about like the court system
01:12:27.36 --> 01:12:31.76 or like you know yeah no well rules will get put in place for sure
01:12:31.76 --> 01:12:40.24 because people don't trust the subordinates that have to fall the rule right you tell your kids
01:12:40.24 --> 01:12:44.40 you're not allowed to go in the yard because the pools out there right what you're really saying
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:49.20 is I don't trust that you're not going to go in the pool or I don't trust that you're that you can
01:12:49.20 --> 01:12:52.48 swim all enough if you're a good leader you'll be like okay we got it we need to work on this you
01:12:52.48 --> 01:12:56.16 can understand the dangers that's a little bit of a weird thing to talk about because drum and
01:12:56.16 --> 01:12:59.52 a pool for a little kid you obviously have to air towards the side of safety that's probably not
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:05.20 the best example but if you tell your kid no one's allowed to come okay I'm going on a trip
01:13:05.20 --> 01:13:11.36 Friday night no one come over to the house those are the rules right you know if my kids
01:13:11.36 --> 01:13:14.48 actually understood what I really meant is like hey if you want to have a couple kids over
01:13:14.48 --> 01:13:19.84 that's cool don't get crazy don't eat my food no weird stay away from the milk no weirdos no
01:13:19.84 --> 01:13:23.76 you know if they understood all that which actually that's what my kids were like okay
01:13:23.76 --> 01:13:27.76 got a couple kids coming over it's all good yeah if they broke the trust
01:13:27.76 --> 01:13:34.48 then things might be different then I have to go and implement rules yeah but on top of that
01:13:34.48 --> 01:13:38.24 you're to you're talking about like your kids or like you know in the military if you're dealing
01:13:38.24 --> 01:13:43.92 with like one unit or one little group of people but if the rules of engagement or in your
01:13:43.92 --> 01:13:48.40 case like the rule of people coming over what if what if it didn't just apply to your kids what
01:13:48.40 --> 01:13:53.60 if it applied to the whole block or the whole town or whatever so it's like just to keep everyone safe
01:13:53.60 --> 01:13:59.04 we got to set this is the standard which is why we don't want communism because they just make
01:13:59.04 --> 01:14:04.56 rules that are blank it over everyone well that's how laws are even here you know like the gun laws
01:14:04.56 --> 01:14:07.84 consider the gun laws first they're like hey we need background check but the good rules
01:14:07.84 --> 01:14:12.24 got to apply to everyone you know you can't like discriminate kind of thing you they have to
01:14:12.24 --> 01:14:17.92 apply to everybody so it's like man well yeah that's the gun rules are a perfect example
01:14:17.92 --> 01:14:25.36 because they don't trust the the people everyone yeah certain people yeah oh everyone just can't
01:14:25.36 --> 01:14:31.20 have a gun you have to get a background check okay fair enough why but then it goes then it continues
01:14:31.20 --> 01:14:34.80 see that's that's where that's where you run into progress where so much debate about gun laws
01:14:34.80 --> 01:14:39.60 because pretty much everyone says hey I get it you should probably get some kind of a background
01:14:39.60 --> 01:14:44.48 check before you get a firearm everyone goes hmm okay I don't want somebody that's been
01:14:44.48 --> 01:14:48.72 I don't want somebody that's a felon or a violent criminal to be able to get a gun cool I agree with
01:14:48.72 --> 01:14:54.80 that the problem is where does it stop and and then the problem on top of that is
01:14:55.52 --> 01:15:02.80 because of the where does it stop because of the slippery slope thing the people that don't want
01:15:02.80 --> 01:15:07.28 any gun laws they just say we don't want any like every single you know well we think we're
01:15:07.28 --> 01:15:13.76 the background check should be an extra three days no way yeah and meanwhile on the other side
01:15:14.80 --> 01:15:20.32 people are saying every single thing that they can do to restrict firearms from being
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:27.28 had by anybody they try and move it there so both sides are just take an extreme position
01:15:27.28 --> 01:15:33.76 and no one will actually have a normal logical conversation about what's going on yeah it's just
01:15:33.76 --> 01:15:39.44 and even when you do men it is you're like in screaming yes and that and from the polar polarised
01:15:39.44 --> 01:15:44.56 positions yeah and a lot of times even if you're in that in the moment like you can step back and see
01:15:44.56 --> 01:15:48.64 that when that happens when people are just like hey you're just defending your position just
01:15:48.64 --> 01:15:52.08 just kind of blindly or whatever you can see that happen I'm not saying like it's so terrible
01:15:52.08 --> 01:15:58.80 and it's natural I get it but even if you can have like a civilized discussion it's still hard
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:06.32 because it's based on people yeah because people get because like for me I should absolutely
01:16:07.04 --> 01:16:14.000 be able to have whatever guns I want right that's that's the way I feel I feel that I should
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.96 be able to and I yes you can check my background you can see if I am a felon or a violent criminal
01:16:20.96 --> 01:16:26.000 you can see that I'm not okay you should be able to I should be able to get whatever guns I want
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.96 and but there's some people that think hey you know but as strong as I feel about that as
01:16:32.96 --> 01:16:38.80 strong as I feel like I should be able to what get whatever guns I want if someone says oh well
01:16:40.24 --> 01:16:44.88 then you agree that everyone should be able to get every gun they want to know actually I don't
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:51.52 agree with that I think that there's some people that don't need guns I can say that I can say
01:16:51.52 --> 01:16:58.72 that without without thinking without saying oh well jocco believes in gun control for everyone it's
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:05.92 like no I just said what I believed so the rules are about trust and you have to figure out where
01:17:05.92 --> 01:17:11.12 the trust lies with everyone and you have to figure out what the minimum amount of trust is that
01:17:11.12 --> 01:17:16.56 you can overlay on people everywhere and that's where that's why governing a giant country is so
01:17:16.56 --> 01:17:21.36 hard and depending on where you live to because depending on where you live you have different needs
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.48 you have different like there's some people that live yeah there's the culture's different but
01:17:26.48 --> 01:17:31.84 depending on where you live like if you live in a state where there's predatory animals
01:17:32.48 --> 01:17:37.60 and you live out in the bush somewhere you're you're damn right you need guns if you live in a
01:17:37.60 --> 01:17:41.60 state where there's predatory animals that are human beings that will break in your house and
01:17:41.60 --> 01:17:48.32 kill you guess what you also need to be able to protect your family that's good to go you know
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:56.40 somebody asked me their days like is is is is actually Tim is actually Tim Ferris who's asking me if
01:17:56.40 --> 01:18:03.44 Pepper spray is good home defense I'm like Pepper spray is good home defense against a person that
01:18:03.44 --> 01:18:09.12 isn't carrying a weapon I said but if someone's breaking into your house or coming to attack you
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:14.32 are they not going to have a weapon do are they following some kind of a rules of engagement where
01:18:14.32 --> 01:18:20.08 they're I'm going on a basic being a tonight I'm only going to bring you know I'm only going to
01:18:20.08 --> 01:18:25.92 bring my my pillow to hit people I know they're asking your house to kill you or they're breaking
01:18:25.92 --> 01:18:30.88 your house to to assault your family yeah whatever they're breaking in your house to they shouldn't
01:18:30.88 --> 01:18:34.72 be breaking in your house and they're probably going to be able to defend themselves because they
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:37.76 don't want to get caught so what do they do to protect your family so as they got a knife or
01:18:37.76 --> 01:18:43.36 they got on whatever they got to go in the name so Pepper spray great the problem with Pepper spray is
01:18:43.36 --> 01:18:47.84 you don't you don't they're not following rules of engagement there's a rules of engagement
01:18:47.84 --> 01:18:53.36 yeah that's a good question too but like Pepper spray why would you use like think of a
01:18:53.36 --> 01:18:58.08 real scenario where you would use Pepper spray as a as a human the girl I get it because you have
01:18:58.08 --> 01:19:02.24 valuable goods regardless of where you go you know you can be at the post stuff you still got those
01:19:02.24 --> 01:19:08.32 valuable goods that that predators might want as a girl but let's say okay I'm too far as or
01:19:08.32 --> 01:19:12.96 I'm you know I'm me or whatever why when would I use the Pepper spray realistic I'm sure
01:19:12.96 --> 01:19:18.96 I think I'm just asking that because it's a legitimate question because if someone says look I'm
01:19:18.96 --> 01:19:22.32 not really comfortable with guns but if someone wants comes into my house I want to be able to defend
01:19:22.32 --> 01:19:27.76 myself I'm going to get Pepper spray and the the real quick answer is like yeah okay cool yeah
01:19:27.76 --> 01:19:31.84 better than not it makes you go oh that kind of makes sense right at least you got something
01:19:32.40 --> 01:19:37.60 the reality is the person's coming to your house it's Pepper spray is great as long as they don't have
01:19:37.60 --> 01:19:43.84 a knife yeah as long as they don't have a gun in which case the Pepper spray is doing you know good
01:19:43.84 --> 01:19:48.16 yeah because you Pepper spray me and I have a knife I'm going to grab a hold of you I'm going to
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:53.68 come and cut your head off right in a situation that you you got to use the Pepper spray so like
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:57.92 if someone's like burglarizing you and you turn on the light and they scatter you don't need the
01:19:57.92 --> 01:20:01.92 Pepper spray for that kind of situation you know Pepper spray is for someone who like whoa yeah but
01:20:01.92 --> 01:20:06.64 you don't know that they're gonna scatter yeah just like you don't know if they have a gun or not
01:20:06.64 --> 01:20:12.16 yes yeah yeah and if you're prowling around in someone's house you're going to be in a
01:20:12.16 --> 01:20:18.16 serious situation yeah I think you should be yeah you're going to be in real bad situation yeah so
01:20:18.16 --> 01:20:23.28 that's what rules are and rules of engagement so going back we're trying to bring this back rules
01:20:23.28 --> 01:20:28.08 of engagement that's exactly that's exactly why rules of engagement can be tricky but they shouldn't
01:20:28.08 --> 01:20:33.60 be if you train your people well if the people understand what the strategic mission if they
01:20:33.60 --> 01:20:36.80 understand what the parameters you put the parameters in there and they're loosening off that people
01:20:36.80 --> 01:20:42.32 can maneuver inside those parameters then occasionally they got to call you up and say hey I
01:20:42.32 --> 01:20:46.96 had to break the rules and you say oh what happened and they explained it to you go okay good call yeah
01:20:46.96 --> 01:20:57.76 yeah people need to understand that continuing on urban combat is nearly always conducted at
01:20:57.76 --> 01:21:01.84 very close quarters it is not uncommon to have opposing forces fighting from positions a few
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:07.20 dozen meters apart most of the fighting is done from a distance between 50 and 500 meters due to this
01:21:07.20 --> 01:21:13.20 close in nature it is critical to know where the enemy is and how they are deployed again this is a
01:21:13.20 --> 01:21:19.92 fantasy like knowing where the enemy is and how they're deployed is really hard to do even when
01:21:19.92 --> 01:21:26.72 you have even when you have overhead coverage looking in the city I'll tell you an example I was
01:21:26.72 --> 01:21:34.56 watching my guys out on a mission I was watching on a UAV feed so we're watching we're watching
01:21:35.36 --> 01:21:41.52 and looking for enemy and all of a sudden we see weird activities of vehicle the vehicle stops
01:21:41.52 --> 01:21:47.20 the vehicle kind of moves a little bit stops again guys get out they look around open up the trunk
01:21:48.16 --> 01:21:53.12 and now we're totally focused like oh these guys are getting ready to attack open up the trunk
01:21:53.60 --> 01:21:57.68 and as they're starting to pull stuff out of the trunk my guys get hit from a different spot
01:21:57.68 --> 01:22:01.60 that we weren't looking because you can't see everything especially in a city because think of it
01:22:01.60 --> 01:22:07.76 with buildings as soon as you go off angle a little bit you can't see the street anymore because it's
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:13.28 down in the building so we actually are totally focused on this one thing and maneuvering the
01:22:13.28 --> 01:22:20.16 the air asset to look at these people in a car and as as they're as we're monitoring these
01:22:20.16 --> 01:22:25.92 guys these suspected enemy personnel I'll send my guys get shot at from somewhere else and we
01:22:25.92 --> 01:22:33.68 completely miss it and we continue to watch these guys and they pull out a jack and a tire and they
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:38.56 lift up the car and they change the tire and they leave but like you just normal but it looked
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:42.64 very suspect so to think that you're ever gonna know where the enemy is and how they're
01:22:43.20 --> 01:22:47.92 deployed is very very challenging at best you do the best it doesn't mean you don't try
01:22:47.92 --> 01:22:51.68 you definitely try but you you don't get all that information you just don't get it
01:22:51.68 --> 01:22:59.12 hey those UAVs how high are those depends on the UAV so like can they see them like can
01:22:59.12 --> 01:23:04.48 people see them or are they just depends on the UAV and like I don't know what the classification
01:23:04.48 --> 01:23:08.72 of all that stuff is so I'm not talking about it good I don't know what the I just know that
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:12.64 they go a different heights I'll leave it at that yeah well because on the internet you can see
01:23:12.64 --> 01:23:16.48 those you know those videos every once in a while they feel just have them yeah then it's like
01:23:16.48 --> 01:23:21.60 dang those guys don't even see that or you know I don't know if they do or don't go to optics too
01:23:22.24 --> 01:23:26.88 like real good optics I mean just imagine you know the optics that we have in the civilian sector
01:23:26.88 --> 01:23:31.28 yeah even those are good enough to be pretty amazing yeah so
01:23:33.36 --> 01:23:36.80 talk about knowing where the enemy is this lesson was learned a hard way during the initial
01:23:36.80 --> 01:23:40.48 stages of the battle inside the Citadel during the first two major clashes between
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:45.12 marine and NVA forces on the morning of 13 February 1968 the enemy surprised us and
01:23:45.12 --> 01:23:51.28 reaped significant damages very quickly this is because we weren't exactly sure where they were
01:23:51.28 --> 01:23:58.80 although the the arvine which the south-eutomy's army had been in several major battles inside the
01:23:58.80 --> 01:24:04.48 Citadel I don't recall receiving any intelligence attributed to them regarding the enemy's
01:24:04.48 --> 01:24:09.04 exact location further to my knowledge no marine recon unit was sent to check out the situation
01:24:09.04 --> 01:24:16.08 before attacking on the morning of the 13th so that's rough and I'll tell you one thing that
01:24:16.08 --> 01:24:21.76 from my mind where's the enemy the enemy's everywhere that you have to approach things as if the enemy
01:24:21.76 --> 01:24:26.40 can be anywhere and the only way you can know that they're not where they're not everywhere is when you
01:24:26.40 --> 01:24:32.72 take something down and you secure it that's when you're not there then you move on we recommend that
01:24:32.72 --> 01:24:37.68 all intelligence assets recon units and surveillance devices that can be made available are deployed
01:24:37.68 --> 01:24:42.40 in a significant effort to fix the exact location of enemy soldiers and units again this is
01:24:42.40 --> 01:24:48.32 you can see where this is coming out of this for these guys they must have been completely outflanked all the
01:24:48.32 --> 01:24:53.52 time where they were thinking where is the enemy we need to know where the enemy is and it's a really
01:24:53.52 --> 01:24:59.52 hard to know that the enemy can bat who knows where his enemy is hiding experiences this
01:24:59.52 --> 01:25:04.72 experiences a decided advantage in surprise and the deployment of firepower of course
01:25:06.08 --> 01:25:10.000 now again this doesn't like I'm saying it's hard to have definitely doesn't mean you
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000 mitigate it doesn't mean you don't put up UAV so you can see maneuver doesn't mean you don't
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.68 gather intelligence doesn't mean people shouldn't report back and and explain where they
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:25.12 think the enemy is so we at least have an estimate hmm continuing the combat urban combat tactics
01:25:25.12 --> 01:25:31.44 the tragedy of urban conflict is that the battlefield for each firefight is a neighborhood each objective
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:36.48 taken is someone's home or a school or church or some other structure that has value and
01:25:36.48 --> 01:25:42.96 more or less significant meaning to its inhabitants considering the possibilities it is not difficult
01:25:42.96 --> 01:25:48.16 to imagine tank battles across mall parking lots mortar fire hitting a church a hospital
01:25:48.16 --> 01:25:54.24 community center heavy small arms fire fights between homes and artillery barrage on a school yard
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:01.12 while these images may be grist for the mills of Hollywood when we think about them in relevance to
01:26:01.12 --> 01:26:08.08 our homes and our neighborhood schools and churches the tragedy is somehow increased however
01:26:08.08 --> 01:26:15.60 it is our collective belief that the life of one marine is more precious than 10 100 homes
01:26:15.60 --> 01:26:21.28 schools churches shrines shopping malls or any other building known demand
01:26:23.28 --> 01:26:28.72 therefore all efforts should be made using any and all weaponry available to stun the enemy and
01:26:28.72 --> 01:26:35.20 support marine advances through the use of supporting arms and without regard to damage to buildings
01:26:37.20 --> 01:26:43.04 so clearly the whole idea that this started off with of the rules and engagement that we're
01:26:43.04 --> 01:26:48.88 restricting heavy firepower because the historical nature of the city a if you don't want
01:26:48.88 --> 01:26:58.48 historical buildings destroyed don't have a war and if you think we should save a building
01:26:58.48 --> 01:27:06.48 and that's gonna cost the life of one of our brothers not happening continuing at the same time
01:27:06.48 --> 01:27:12.72 the use of heavy weaponry and urban combat is an assuredly two-edged sword as our many assets in
01:27:12.72 --> 01:27:20.56 modern warfare rubble can be nearly as effective as a building for protecting enemy firing positions
01:27:20.56 --> 01:27:24.64 further artillery and other flat trajectory weapons may be somewhat restricted by the
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:29.12 height of buildings and their distance from each other in many cases mortars although smaller
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:37.60 in caliber were superior because of their higher trajectory so interestingly indirect fire
01:27:39.28 --> 01:27:45.76 indirect fire taking the indirect approach is often better than the flat trajectory
01:27:45.76 --> 01:27:50.48 I'm gonna shoot through your front door no we're gonna lob in some rounds on you so so we think about
01:27:50.48 --> 01:27:55.60 that when we're dealing with people punching them in the face is not as good as coming from an
01:27:55.60 --> 01:28:00.24 indirect position where they don't quite see where it's coming from but it still gives them a little
01:28:00.24 --> 01:28:07.60 crack and it's even to the point where he says the even though they're smaller in caliber so even though
01:28:08.80 --> 01:28:13.28 somebody does something that you want to straighten them out on when you hear them in the face
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:18.08 we know what the reaction is they get defensive all that things when we come from from a flank
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:24.56 or indirect fire it's smaller caliber not even as it's doesn't hate as hard but it's more effective
01:28:24.56 --> 01:28:33.28 yeah just more effective in the rectifier all day long continuing supporting arms supporting arms
01:28:33.28 --> 01:28:36.88 the most effective our most effective prior to danger close to minimize the potential of
01:28:36.88 --> 01:28:42.08 friendly casualties and maximize preparatory fires to support the infantry's attack during
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:46.24 operation way city the most effective indirect fire during danger close was from an
01:28:46.24 --> 01:28:51.28 eight inch gun we recommend that the supporting access of fire be perpendicular as well as parallel
01:28:51.28 --> 01:28:56.40 finally in the event as in the case of operation way city that due to political considerations
01:28:56.40 --> 01:29:02.24 that proper preparatory fires would not be allowed that a variety of artillery fires such a
01:29:02.24 --> 01:29:07.84 smoke delayed fuses high angle can be incorporated with the infantry's attack combined arms
01:29:07.84 --> 01:29:16.16 training for urban combat as critical it's covered move that's what supporting arms
01:29:16.16 --> 01:29:21.60 do they lay down cover so you can maneuver it other advantage of preparatory firing
01:29:21.60 --> 01:29:26.24 include the destruction over the camouflage of enemy positions the psychological shock factor
01:29:26.24 --> 01:29:30.16 against enemy troops and the fact that heavy weapons can create new avenues of attack and
01:29:30.16 --> 01:29:38.40 egress for armored vehicles pretty straightforward one of the most effective aspects of
01:29:38.40 --> 01:29:45.12 supporting arms during the battle of way were the killer teams that evolved the M48 tank and the
01:29:45.12 --> 01:29:51.76 antos and the antos is like a it's it's actually a pretty crazy looking machine it's got
01:29:51.76 --> 01:29:58.40 160 16 millimeter like cannons on it and it's got six of them and they're kind of like sticky now
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:02.24 and it's a light armored vehicle it's like a tank anti tank vehicle but um
01:30:03.36 --> 01:30:07.36 antos were pair up and maneuver together as a team this would allow either the tank or the
01:30:07.36 --> 01:30:14.48 antos to maneuver into a good fire position where while the other covered cover move.
01:30:14.48 --> 01:30:20.000 Thank you further the devastating fire power put out by the 90 millimeter tank cannon and the
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.48 six one oh six is of the antos turned out to be extremely beneficial because their capabilities
01:30:24.48 --> 01:30:30.88 to deliver pinpoint fire power armored vehicles can provide many benefits to the infantry
01:30:30.88 --> 01:30:38.08 engaged in urban combat as they provide some cover from enemy small arms fire however armored vehicles
01:30:38.08 --> 01:30:43.84 can also become rocket magnets producing casualties for infantry troops in close proximity.
01:30:43.84 --> 01:30:49.04 The enemy's gonna see that target and they're gonna like it.
01:30:50.16 --> 01:30:55.84 Yeah and there's advantages to having that power but there's also disadvantages so you have to
01:30:55.84 --> 01:30:59.12 always weigh those things out as a leader you have to pay attention to those things.
01:30:59.12 --> 01:31:03.28 As a leader you have to think of every advantage that you have there's gonna be some
01:31:03.84 --> 01:31:07.04 negative to it there's gonna be some disadvantage when you bring an advantage to table there's
01:31:07.04 --> 01:31:12.48 gonna be some disadvantage. And you get to right if you're gonna be super flexible you're not that strong.
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:16.72 Yeah if you're gonna be super strong you're not that flexible. Your cardio doesn't last very long.
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:21.92 Right so there's gonna be advantages and disadvantages that come with each asset that you have.
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:26.16 So you have to think you're gonna go for full ox that's cool you're giving up position.
01:31:26.88 --> 01:31:30.16 There's all kinds of things you have to weigh those out and as a leader you have to look at.
01:31:30.16 --> 01:31:32.88 Don't get wrapped around the positives of something.
01:31:32.88 --> 01:31:37.92 Great just the positives. There's not just positives for for really anything.
01:31:37.92 --> 01:31:42.96 Yeah there's nothing that's just straight positives across the board. I guess right?
01:31:43.68 --> 01:31:46.40 I'm sure we could think of something. Yeah and I'm sure you could.
01:31:50.16 --> 01:31:55.52 Continue other than instances of harassment and introduction fires buildings that are hit by heavy weapons
01:31:55.52 --> 01:32:01.92 should be attacked immediately. This is good. Buildings that are hit by heavy weapons should be attacked immediately.
01:32:01.92 --> 01:32:07.68 Don't hesitate. You catch people off guard don't hesitate. Don't hesitate. This happens
01:32:07.68 --> 01:32:13.76 this happens in everything. We get a good position or something and advantage just happens and we
01:32:13.76 --> 01:32:18.32 hesitate instead of taking advantage of the advantage. We go, oh god of here. Yeah.
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:22.80 And then then we let it go. It happens in business too. We get to a situation.
01:32:23.68 --> 01:32:29.52 Oh we finally get the we finally get our competitor to make a mistake.
01:32:29.52 --> 01:32:38.16 Or we get an advantage position and we celebrate instead of just finishing the job. Yeah. Which is a big bad thing to do.
01:32:41.84 --> 01:32:45.68 Remember that when calling and fire missions you can request splash so you're friendly
01:32:45.68 --> 01:32:49.76 troops have time to take cover immediately prior to impact. These guys were calling bombs right
01:32:49.76 --> 01:32:55.60 on top of a lot. In daytime operations the use of covering smoke is often helpful when
01:32:55.60 --> 01:33:03.84 Marines pass the attack across open areas. As was learned during Operation Ways City even with
01:33:03.84 --> 01:33:08.48 proper support of heavy weapons which was ultimately provided to the Marines we faced hard
01:33:08.48 --> 01:33:13.76 core north for Vietnamese army troops who fought from prepared positions and moved to secondary
01:33:13.76 --> 01:33:20.56 positions fought again and finally very reluctantly died. In the capture of each room, each floor,
01:33:20.56 --> 01:33:26.40 each rooftop each building each street. It was ultimately the Marine riflemen who won the battle.
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:38.40 It's as a leader. As a leader, do you always have to remember that line right there?
01:33:39.44 --> 01:33:43.04 In the capture of each room each floor, each rooftop each building each street. It was
01:33:43.04 --> 01:33:52.16 ultimately the Marine riflemen who won the battle. As a leader, if you think that all you need to
01:33:52.16 --> 01:33:58.96 do is make a good decision and then you're going to win your wrong. The folks on the front line
01:33:58.96 --> 01:34:04.16 have to truly understand what is happening and there are the ones that are going to carry the day.
01:34:05.20 --> 01:34:09.76 And you could come up with a best battle plan ever. You could come up with a best strategic business
01:34:09.76 --> 01:34:14.64 plan ever and if you don't have folks that are engaged and willing and are going to take the
01:34:14.64 --> 01:34:20.24 fight to the enemy and are going to win that foothold. They're going to enter that room.
01:34:21.36 --> 01:34:25.92 They're going to go out and sell into whatever industry you're trying to get into.
01:34:25.92 --> 01:34:31.44 If you don't have people that you trust that are trained that are ready that are prepared,
01:34:31.44 --> 01:34:40.48 if you don't have them, best battle plan in the world isn't going to work. It's critical for
01:34:40.48 --> 01:34:44.96 infantry units. No both the capabilities as well as the limitations of supporting arms.
01:34:47.92 --> 01:34:50.96 Know your limitations. This is again, there's positives and there's negatives.
01:34:54.64 --> 01:34:58.64 Another aspect of supporting arms, limitations has to do with helicopter support.
01:34:58.64 --> 01:35:03.04 Urban terrain is not very forgiving to helicopters that may be forced to make an emergency landing.
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:07.12 Helicopter pilots might be reluctant to fly over urban terrain.
01:35:09.68 --> 01:35:10.72 Know these things.
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:18.72 One very tragic aspect of using supporting arms in urban combat is that the likelihood of civilian
01:35:18.72 --> 01:35:25.12 casualties is very high. In at least two situations that we are aware of, the NVA used civilians as
01:35:25.12 --> 01:35:32.08 screens for their infantry troops and fire missions were of necessity called in on those positions.
01:35:35.28 --> 01:35:48.88 So, no, expect, pre-discuss these things, let your troops understand, put them in role
01:35:48.88 --> 01:35:54.08 place in areas where they have to make a decision on what's happening. It's better to think through it 20 times
01:35:54.72 --> 01:35:59.36 and make 20 mistakes while we're doing some kind of a role-play scenario.
01:36:00.64 --> 01:36:04.80 Then it is to have to make that decision for the first time. When you're on the battlefield
01:36:04.80 --> 01:36:07.28 you can't discuss. You can't debrief.
01:36:07.28 --> 01:36:12.88 Yeah. Not to mention the stress that's going to kind of. Yeah, absolutely.
01:36:12.88 --> 01:36:19.92 Use of chemical weapons during one five's battle inside the Citadel fortress which was kicked off
01:36:19.92 --> 01:36:25.52 on 13 February 1968. The battalion progressed at total of four blocks along our avenue of attack
01:36:25.52 --> 01:36:30.08 and head secured at total of 16 city blocks within our assigned area of operations after nearly
01:36:30.08 --> 01:36:35.92 two weeks of heavy street fighting and after suffering nearly 50% casualties at the hands of a
01:36:35.92 --> 01:36:41.92 well-prepared determined force of NVA soldiers, a force that finally estimated that was finally
01:36:41.92 --> 01:36:46.08 estimated to be nearly 11,000 strong in the waste in the waste city area of operations.
01:36:47.04 --> 01:36:53.84 On February 25, 1968, Marines from Charlie Company shot off three E8 gas launchers,
01:36:55.04 --> 01:37:00.24 caring about 40 CS gas grenades toward the enemy's last known position. The next morning,
01:37:00.24 --> 01:37:05.36 one five took control of the remaining 12 city blocks in about three hours without a single
01:37:05.36 --> 01:37:11.20 casualty because the NVA was not equipped to deal with teargrass attack and was forced to withdraw.
01:37:13.12 --> 01:37:16.000 So we're going from 50% casualties to zero.
01:37:21.44 --> 01:37:26.96 Taking a different approach, utilizing weapons that no one was used to utilizing.
01:37:28.24 --> 01:37:32.80 The enemy who had never had not seen, they even have gas masks. They just had to get out of there
01:37:32.80 --> 01:37:40.16 and that E8 gas launcher, it's like a suitcase looking thing and it's got eight tubes that have
01:37:40.16 --> 01:37:46.08 eight rounds at each and them and it fires them like five seconds apart. So we're talking a lot of gas.
01:37:47.60 --> 01:37:52.48 Especially they shot off three of them. You don't want none of that.
01:37:55.68 --> 01:37:58.88 No one can ever be certain that the use of chemical weapons would have made a difference in the
01:37:58.88 --> 01:38:04.16 initial stages of the battle, but many of the veterans of that battle have often wondered what
01:38:04.16 --> 01:38:08.96 might have happened if the E8s had been deployed in the early stages of the battle. We recommend
01:38:08.96 --> 01:38:13.36 the judicious use of chemical weapons such as tear gases, etc. for combat operations.
01:38:15.84 --> 01:38:20.08 A administration planning and preparation, the inherent complexities of urban combat are such
01:38:20.08 --> 01:38:25.92 that special attention needs to be paid toward planning and preparations, training, training,
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:33.52 practice makes perfect. A coordinated marine attack on an enemy held position in an
01:38:33.52 --> 01:38:40.08 town or city can be equated to an intricate opera or Broadway production, although the stakes are a bit higher.
01:38:42.48 --> 01:38:46.88 Entry techniques, room search and clearing techniques, voice commands indicating movement or
01:38:46.88 --> 01:38:51.36 progress, fire discipline, the use of grenades, rocket supporting fires, communications,
01:38:51.36 --> 01:38:56.24 all of these must be rehearsed and improved until they are second nature.
01:39:01.12 --> 01:39:08.48 Second nature. I was talking to you the other day. You were saying something about
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:18.56 my guillotine choke that it was there quickly. Yes. Yeah. And I was saying it's second. It's I should
01:39:18.56 --> 01:39:25.12 have said it's second nature because what I did tell you is sometimes I become aware like we'll be
01:39:25.12 --> 01:39:28.72 rolling and all of a sudden I'll be like, oh I've got a guillotine right now. Yeah. I didn't even
01:39:29.36 --> 01:39:35.12 this way just showed up there with zero fought whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. That's how you need to be.
01:39:37.20 --> 01:39:42.32 If I have to think about putting a guillotine on someone, then that means they have time to think about
01:39:42.32 --> 01:39:47.20 defending. Right. If I didn't even think about it, it just happened. Just sort of. Yeah. And
01:39:47.20 --> 01:39:52.16 didn't. Not to split hairs. It's less about the guillotine specifically. It's just about your
01:39:52.16 --> 01:39:56.72 like what do you call a head control. You know, you know, you get that chin strap. Oh yeah. It's that
01:39:56.72 --> 01:40:02.32 where that just arrives. And then sure it'll become a guillotine for sure. Or a cobra or one of these
01:40:02.32 --> 01:40:08.80 other treacherous moves. Good. You like the implement from time to time. Yeah. But yeah. It's like
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:14.48 your head. Well, I feel like I feel like it's second nature from my head to just land in there.
01:40:14.48 --> 01:40:20.96 That's what it feels like for sure. But obviously it's your thing. Oh no. But that's the way we want to
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:28.000 train. That's the way we want to train. And I would say I'll add to this that what we want to train
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.16 is we want to train for chaos. We want to train from mayhem. We want to train for the enemy to do
01:40:32.16 --> 01:40:35.68 things. We're not expecting. That's the way we want to train for. Because when you train for things
01:40:35.68 --> 01:40:41.12 that the enemy is not expecting the enemy do, you actually get good at reacting to it. You know,
01:40:41.12 --> 01:40:49.52 you can get good at scrambling. Yeah. Injutsu. Yeah. You can get good at ending up in positions that are
01:40:49.52 --> 01:40:54.08 beneficial. If you know, conscious thought. But because you've scrambled enough that now you just
01:40:54.08 --> 01:40:57.36 know what you're looking for. These little things are going to happen. I'm going to get the underhook.
01:40:57.36 --> 01:41:01.12 I'm going to get my hips in the right spot. I'm going to move my head over here. That's what we want to
01:41:01.12 --> 01:41:09.76 do. Yeah. Like the almost cliche saying to get comfortable being uncomfortable. So kind of thing,
01:41:09.76 --> 01:41:14.64 you know, it's like, yeah, you train yourself to be uncomfortable or to be trained in being uncomfortable.
01:41:14.64 --> 01:41:18.88 You can just deal better. But I'm trying to get something. I'm trying to reach a different point here.
01:41:18.88 --> 01:41:30.16 My point is this. If I let's say, let's say, here's, there's a through Z situations I can put you
01:41:30.16 --> 01:41:36.88 in. And they're all different. If I train you for A and B all the time, when I throw
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:48.72 F at you, you're lost. If I throw Q at you, you're lost. If I train you, so I get you good at A and B.
01:41:48.72 --> 01:41:54.48 But then I start training you at DS or thrown you at F. I start throwing you at M. You will start to
01:41:54.48 --> 01:42:02.000 realize that even in these disparate scenarios, there are some commonalities. And there are some
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.68 base positions that you can go to that will allow you the time to assess and make decisions.
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:18.56 All right. So you can, you can get good at chaos. That's what I'm saying. You can get good at chaos.
01:42:21.68 --> 01:42:27.52 You can get good at it. You can say, oh, when I see things happening that I don't understand,
01:42:27.52 --> 01:42:33.76 here's what I need to do. I need to find a good covered position, hopefully elevated where I can
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:40.16 look around. I need to figure out where my troops are. I need to do it very quickly. I need to
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:48.40 identify a prominent terrain feature that I can move all of us to in a rapid manner so that I can
01:42:48.40 --> 01:42:54.16 get controlled situation right there. Now with those things that I just said, hey, I'm going to
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:58.56 get into position where I can look around. I'm going to try and figure out where my people are.
01:42:58.56 --> 01:43:03.92 I'm going to look for a prominent terrain feature that I can utilize as a stronghold. Guess what I just
01:43:03.92 --> 01:43:10.96 solved for just about any scenario that unfolds that I don't understand. I have a plan. I have a plan
01:43:10.96 --> 01:43:18.96 that I can actually implement against any situation. Think about that. So, oh, if I get a contact
01:43:18.96 --> 01:43:24.08 front, I have a plan. Oh, we start getting a shot up from the front and we're in an open ground
01:43:24.08 --> 01:43:30.64 I have a plan. It's a standard operating procedure. Oh, I start getting shot up from the front and
01:43:30.64 --> 01:43:35.20 we're in close terrain. I have a plan. There's a specific immediate action drill we're going to
01:43:35.20 --> 01:43:42.24 perform. Oh, wait a second. I'm getting shot at. I'm not sure where it is. I hear screaming. I know
01:43:42.24 --> 01:43:47.12 that we're getting hit from multiple locations. What do I need to do? I have an immediate action for
01:43:47.12 --> 01:43:51.68 that too. I'm going to find cover. I'm going to look around. I'm going to try and figure out where
01:43:51.68 --> 01:43:56.32 my troops are and I'm going to look for a prominent terrain feature that we can move towards.
01:43:56.32 --> 01:44:03.44 Yeah. There. Now the sun, the chaos isn't really chaos. Right. Now the sun, I have a plan.
01:44:03.44 --> 01:44:07.60 Yeah, it's a kind of a kind of chaos. And I can actually apply that plan to almost any scenario.
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:14.48 So, the more that you train people for things that they don't expect and don't understand,
01:44:14.48 --> 01:44:23.52 the better they will get it dealing with those things. Yeah. And that's very positive. Yeah.
01:44:22.56 --> 01:44:32.16 Moving on. Further, all plans must be communicated and rehearsed at each level of command
01:44:32.16 --> 01:44:38.24 from the fire team to the company and above. It sounds like these guys did not have good decentralized
01:44:38.24 --> 01:44:43.60 command in terms of actually knowing what the overall plan was because it sounds like the fire teams were
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:49.20 there, even the putty and the fire team levels were a little bit lost at points. In particular,
01:44:49.20 --> 01:44:53.20 putty and commanders, putty and sergeants and squad leaders and fire team leaders must be aware
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:58.16 of each man's assignment. This should include who goes into a structure first, who covers.
01:44:59.04 --> 01:45:07.44 Cover move. Nowadays, because we've done in the US military, we've done so much urban combat
01:45:07.44 --> 01:45:15.52 in the last, what has it been 17 years? Every military unit in the US military, they
01:45:16.32 --> 01:45:22.08 can take down a structure and they do it well. And they do it off of standard operating procedures,
01:45:22.08 --> 01:45:29.28 not off of a specific plan of who goes where. Continue on hand in arm signals as well as
01:45:29.28 --> 01:45:39.92 vote commands should be established and practiced. And the last section is called command and
01:45:39.92 --> 01:45:47.92 control. In full-scale urban conflict, especially in situations where enemy dispositions are not
01:45:47.92 --> 01:45:54.40 well known, initial contact with the enemy can be a unexpected b at very close range and see
01:45:54.40 --> 01:46:01.28 massively devastating. Command and control, the basic Marines connection to his leadership can
01:46:01.28 --> 01:46:09.28 disappear in the blink of an eye. During Operation Wacety, Charlie won five lost all of its officers
01:46:09.28 --> 01:46:15.28 except for two. Sergeant's became platoon commanders, PFCs were squad leaders.
01:46:17.12 --> 01:46:22.08 In urban combat, it would not be at all surprising to find PFCs as platoon commanders, given the
01:46:22.08 --> 01:46:28.96 potentially high casualty rates. The critical factor for unit survival in these situations is that
01:46:28.96 --> 01:46:35.92 units ability to immediately determine the enemy's position and to return a high volume of sustained
01:46:35.92 --> 01:46:41.92 fire on those positions, allowing maneuverability despite the situation with the chain of command.
01:46:42.64 --> 01:46:47.76 Two, critical things there. Covenant move is one and decentralized command is two.
01:46:47.76 --> 01:46:54.48 That's what they're talking about. You need to be able to put down high, heavy volume of sustained
01:46:54.48 --> 01:46:59.60 fire on positions so that you can maneuver. And at the same time, you need to be able to do that
01:46:59.60 --> 01:47:08.000 regardless of the situation with the chain of command, decentralized command. During the first day
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.96 of one-fives involvement in Operation Wacety, Alpha Company lost its CO, its Exo, and much of the company
01:47:16.96 --> 01:47:22.32 CP Group. Of necessity, Alpha was pulled back to the battalion rear-freer reorganization.
01:47:22.32 --> 01:47:28.64 We'll also have a few leaders effectively eliminated an entire company. This also delayed the
01:47:28.64 --> 01:47:35.20 battalion's attack, blunting our initiatives. You gotta have a plan if people go down,
01:47:35.20 --> 01:47:38.72 who's taken over. That's gotta be, that's gotta be ready.
01:47:38.72 --> 01:47:48.16 The individual marine who is under heavy enemy fire from very close range, who may now be
01:47:48.16 --> 01:47:53.92 cut off from his team and or squad leader needs to have been thoroughly informed of communications
01:47:53.92 --> 01:47:58.48 codes, lines of departures, lines of stoppage, friendly unit dispositions, and the ability to
01:47:58.48 --> 01:48:04.96 call and supporting fires in conduct, contingency plans. What does that mean? That means the
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:13.44 troops need to understand what is happening. In short, in urban conflict situations, command and
01:48:13.44 --> 01:48:21.04 control needs to be understood at every level down to the basic marine. Based on our experiences
01:48:21.04 --> 01:48:30.88 during Operation Wacety, expect the unexpected, expect chaos and plan for all possibilities,
01:48:30.88 --> 01:48:38.72 and it signed Scott Nelson 1st Lieutenant Commanding Officer Charlie 1-5, Nick War 2nd Lieutenant

01:49:00.08 --> 01:49:20.48 Police Stoke to be born with that. This document, which is now
01:49:20.48 --> 01:49:30.88 well it's 50 years old, 1968, and there's still less as learned in this that applied to
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.08 really apply to everything. Apply to life, apply to urban combat, apply to business,
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:46.48 apply to leadership. So, there you have it, and of course, when we see the way,
01:49:46.48 --> 01:49:55.20 broadly, we can recognize it more, we can see it in more things, and it makes us more effective
01:49:55.20 --> 01:50:04.24 leaders regardless of the battlefield that we're on. So, read, and appreciate the lessons of the past,
01:50:04.24 --> 01:50:16.48 and echo, speaking of the way. I know, I know, due to it's sort of beneficial, sort of helpful
01:50:16.48 --> 01:50:22.72 in allowing us to understand the way more clearly and perhaps even more broadly. I don't know
01:50:22.72 --> 01:50:27.92 if you have any recommendations of how we can sort of get in the game. Yeah, and staying in the game.
01:50:27.92 --> 01:50:36.24 Yeah, it's fun. You mentioned G2 is like a way to recognize things. Like it's so,
01:50:36.24 --> 01:50:42.24 it's such a metaphor, even teaser word metaphor seems like it's like detail. It's like it is life
01:50:42.24 --> 01:50:47.36 in so many ways. Like all even this thing that I'm listening to. Yeah. Read. I'm like, oh yeah,
01:50:47.36 --> 01:50:52.000 I do just, every single one, I just don't want to bore everyone with okay, more G2 stuff.
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:57.28 Like I said, great to set up that on the judo podcast that we did. I was talking about the fact
01:50:57.28 --> 01:51:06.32 that I have to give credit some credit to G2 for sort of revealing to me the thread that
01:51:06.32 --> 01:51:13.60 tied all these things together as JP was in town. Sure. And we were rolling G2 yesterday. And I was
01:51:13.60 --> 01:51:20.48 thinking as like, actually when we were done, I was thinking, man, when we were in Ramadi
01:51:20.48 --> 01:51:29.60 12 years ago, I was a black belt in G2. Like it was beneficial for me then to a
01:51:29.60 --> 01:51:34.32 been a black belt in G2, not because I wasn't going out and grappling against the enemy.
01:51:35.12 --> 01:51:44.56 But I had already started to connect some of these dots. And it's very, very helpful in life.
01:51:44.56 --> 01:51:57.36 Yeah. It's also helpful because it is a physical representation that you can feel and you can see.
01:51:59.12 --> 01:52:04.56 It's not a theory. Yeah. There's theory behind it. But it's not a theory. It's happening to you.
01:52:05.36 --> 01:52:08.64 And therefore when it happens to you, you have something physical, something concrete,
01:52:08.64 --> 01:52:14.80 something that you actually experienced on a physical level. And if you, and that allows you to
01:52:14.80 --> 01:52:24.24 understand it metaphorically better. Yeah. Like when you get caught when someone's trying to choke
01:52:24.24 --> 01:52:28.48 you and then pull them down and walk you and you just got flanked. That just happened to you.
01:52:28.48 --> 01:52:37.04 It's not metaphorical. You truly understand what it feels like to get flanked. If I explain to you,
01:52:37.04 --> 01:52:40.72 hey, when I'm telling you this thing over here and then I come out you from another angle,
01:52:40.72 --> 01:52:46.96 you understand it. You're just starting to grasp the concept. But it didn't happen to you.
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:52.88 But when I'm trying to choke you and you go for the defense and then boom, you get our
01:52:52.88 --> 01:52:58.000 mocked and you didn't see it coming at all, you feel a flank, you feel the effectiveness of
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.28 it in real time. In real time. Yeah. And that's why it's very beneficial to train some of that
01:53:05.28 --> 01:53:13.84 you too. Oh yeah. Feel experience. Yeah. The laws of combat. Mm-hmm. Feel them. Yeah.
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:20.72 You'll have a better comprehension of them. Yeah. And that sounds like a profound level to like that's
01:53:20.72 --> 01:53:26.24 like a that's good if you can keep that in mind. And then you can go on the other side of the
01:53:26.24 --> 01:53:32.24 spectrum where it's like, see you just fighting with your friends with no consequence. You know,
01:53:32.24 --> 01:53:37.12 where I think a lot of the time. What does that mean? Like if mean if you go, hey, let's go
01:53:37.12 --> 01:53:41.20 train right now. What we're going to do when you say let's go train, sure we might go over some
01:53:41.20 --> 01:53:46.80 oh, oh, we're fighting but without real consequences. We don't lose friendship, we don't get injured,
01:53:46.80 --> 01:53:53.04 we don't get you know, wrestle that stuff. But we get to like fight, you know, I don't that's also good.
01:53:53.04 --> 01:54:00.72 Yeah. So in here's the thing like there's other thing like some people in I think we most people
01:54:00.72 --> 01:54:08.32 like we like fighting but we don't want to like fight people. Like I don't want to fight everyone,
01:54:08.32 --> 01:54:15.68 you know? Well because then you can get arrested. Well, sir most people like I said,
01:54:15.68 --> 01:54:19.52 we don't want to just fight you know because there's all kinds of different reasons or whatever.
01:54:19.52 --> 01:54:26.16 But when you can just when you have the opportunity to to fight someone with no consequence,
01:54:26.16 --> 01:54:32.64 just to see how it would go. You know like if you you know these huge, huge men, you know
01:54:32.64 --> 01:54:36.56 guys who are like seven feet tall four and you're probably just huge and strong men and stuff like that.
01:54:37.44 --> 01:54:41.60 You don't want to necessarily fight them but you're like, I wonder how that would be like
01:54:41.60 --> 01:54:47.52 roll with to fight with that guy. You know, when you do your Jitsu you get that. You get that opportunity
01:54:47.52 --> 01:54:51.52 straight up. You want to try to fight this. I wonder how many people out there wondering,
01:54:51.52 --> 01:54:55.76 I want to be a fight juggle. I just say I would beat them up not to say I wouldn't, but I
01:54:55.76 --> 01:55:01.76 wonder how it would be that it's a lot of people show up at the gym and that's exactly why.
01:55:01.76 --> 01:55:05.20 That's the point. If anything is it doesn't matter if their white belts are black belts.
01:55:05.20 --> 01:55:10.000 Yeah, they still like, they can't ever want to see how that experiences you know.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.12 They usually smile. Yeah, fully and really when it comes down to it, I mean unless you're
01:55:15.12 --> 01:55:18.96 trying to hurt someone you know and there's a bunch of different ways to hurt someone if you want
01:55:18.96 --> 01:55:22.56 to hurt them because you don't like them or you think they should you know they deserve it or all this
01:55:22.56 --> 01:55:27.12 stuff. It's not about that. It can be about that for sure, but that's not ultimately what it is.
01:55:27.12 --> 01:55:34.40 It's more about like I wonder I wonder how it beat a fight that person. And then when you start to
01:55:34.40 --> 01:55:39.44 learn more and more and more you just you really just enjoy that activity like quite get to fight. Like
01:55:39.44 --> 01:55:43.60 right now if I wanted to, if you had the time or whatever, mean you we could go we could go fight
01:55:43.60 --> 01:55:48.40 right now. Yeah. And it'd be like in a good safe way. You know, it's wrapped this up then.
01:55:48.40 --> 01:55:57.36 That's the way to do it. Anyway, okay. All right, back to the path. That's the path in
01:55:57.36 --> 01:56:02.72 appropriate part of the path by the way. Yeah. You wouldn't be you without you, just I would
01:56:02.72 --> 01:56:08.40 not be. You wouldn't even be like happy, especially if you knew I wouldn't be happy at all.
01:56:08.40 --> 01:56:18.56 Yeah, especially if I knew, but on top of that I wouldn't have connected things that I
01:56:18.56 --> 01:56:28.32 that you did so connected for me. Yeah, there's something else. I would not be who I am.
01:56:28.32 --> 01:56:33.60 I'm going to straight up say. Yes. I would not be who I am without you, just you. Yeah. And you
01:56:33.60 --> 01:56:38.40 wouldn't be who you would not be on this podcast without your tips. No. I couldn't even talk to you.
01:56:38.40 --> 01:56:43.68 I mean, believe me, it's a stretch anyway. It's a stretch anyway. But without your tips,
01:56:43.68 --> 01:56:47.44 you'll have to at least do something, right? Without that, if you talk about TV shows,
01:56:47.44 --> 01:56:52.24 I'd be like, well, yeah, I'd be like muting your microphone or something. Yeah, I mean, see,
01:56:52.24 --> 01:56:56.80 so did you? Hey, it's a life-saver. So you're insane. Yeah. You get you into all kind of different things.
01:56:56.80 --> 01:57:03.04 But yeah, you know, and even if you're trying to like, it's staying the path. Okay. I'm dragging it.
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:08.08 I dig it, man. But it's important. When you're when you're trying to get on the path, stay on the path.
01:57:08.08 --> 01:57:14.96 Be, be on the path. It's only fitting. For real. It's only fitting. Okay. Let's say,
01:57:14.96 --> 01:57:21.04 okay, let's say you have weapons training. Sweet. Let's say you can drive a car really well.
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:28.08 Cool. You can hunt. You can you're capable. You can, you know, all this stuff, right? But
01:57:29.12 --> 01:57:36.16 if you're stripped away of like your tools, oh, then what? You know, man on man. Yeah, just
01:57:36.16 --> 01:57:40.56 if you don't have the jujitsu. And this is, yeah, and this is more of just a real general, like,
01:57:40.56 --> 01:57:48.24 way to look at it. So it's like, you ever watch men in black? Yeah, I can't really remember to watch about it.
01:57:48.24 --> 01:57:53.68 This might not even be the movie, but it's a movie with one of the, it's like this big,
01:57:53.68 --> 01:57:57.92 rope creature, right? And then they find out it's just a suit and in the inside, there's just this
01:57:57.92 --> 01:58:03.44 little worm type person thing, you know, that kind of, you know. Oh, seriously, if I didn't
01:58:03.44 --> 01:58:09.44 knew jujitsu, I would just be like a little worm. Yeah, you would. Yeah, big. You know, strong
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:14.16 guy or whatever. But then like, if all your tools were taken away, what do you left with kind of
01:58:14.16 --> 01:58:21.28 thing? Isn't it weird when you meet people that are that? Like, they're like big, yeah, maybe
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:27.92 even they're strong, maybe even they are aggressive. Yeah. But they don't have, they don't have a skill.
01:58:27.92 --> 01:58:30.80 They don't have the skill. Right. That's kind of a bummer. That's essentially,
01:58:30.80 --> 01:58:34.56 now here's this, here's the situation that people might be listening and think, okay, well,
01:58:34.56 --> 01:58:38.32 let's say you're in the situation when you don't have the skill. You have two options.
01:58:38.32 --> 01:58:45.20 Option one is the easy path, which is I'm just never going to get that skill. I'm never going
01:58:45.20 --> 01:58:48.48 to go near jujitsu. I'm never going to get in a confrontation with anybody because I don't want
01:58:48.48 --> 01:58:58.96 to be proven to myself that I'm a worm inside of a suit. Or you can take the hard path, which is
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:08.40 even though I'm 37 years old, I'm bummed that I missed out on the, you know, I took me a while,
01:59:08.40 --> 01:59:12.48 but you know what, I'm going to go figure this out. I'm going to go at least learn some of it.
01:59:12.48 --> 01:59:18.16 I'm going to at least learn some of it. I would take that. Oh, yeah. Even though I know it's hard,
01:59:18.88 --> 01:59:22.48 because people, you know, when you're, when you get older, you don't want to try something new.
01:59:22.48 --> 01:59:29.92 Right. Even though it's proven that learning something new is completely beneficial for your
01:59:29.92 --> 01:59:40.64 mental and physical health. Yeah. Yeah. And I, yeah, it's not all like pleasurable roses and stuff.
01:59:40.64 --> 01:59:46.80 Oh, no. There's some, there's some struggle in there. But tell me about it. There's, there's,
01:59:46.80 --> 01:59:52.000 there I had a minister. I was, I was in turtle position. Dean Lister is the shoulders healing
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:59.04 back up. I was in turtle position mount and side control for 22 minutes the other day. And that's a
01:59:59.04 --> 02:00:05.36 struggle. And also he was pushing my face into the mat and saying what color is the mat.
02:00:08.72 --> 02:00:14.48 See, like, you see what I'm saying? Well, was that fun? The answer is no. No, that's high level struggle.
02:00:14.48 --> 02:00:18.56 Yeah. Because the typical person you're going to do, that's not going to happen to you. So that's,
02:00:18.56 --> 02:00:22.56 that's like the struggle. That's the last one. That's going to get some of that has a personal
02:00:23.44 --> 02:00:30.000 vendetta on your existence. Yeah. Dean has on mind. Yeah. I think it's a CD called Kill Jocko does indeed.
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.60 Yeah. Factually nonetheless. All right. There's going to be some struggle in there. You get a
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:38.08 but you jump in there. Just like everything when you learn golf, there's going to be a struggle. No.
02:00:38.08 --> 02:00:43.28 You're going to miss that whole sometimes. Right. No. Thanks for coming struggle. Yeah. But on a
02:00:43.28 --> 02:00:48.72 professional and fundamental level, it's all the same struggle right here. And then last, you're going to
02:00:48.72 --> 02:00:52.88 need to get you. And when you get your gear, you're going to go to originmate.com, get an origin
02:00:52.88 --> 02:00:59.04 gear. It's the best kind of made in America from the cotton grown in America, loomed or weave woven
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:09.36 woven in America, assembled, sewn stitched, presented, enjoyed, utilized, utilized in America.
02:01:09.36 --> 02:01:13.92 I actually can be utilized wherever, but nonetheless, I mean in America, and they are factually
02:01:13.92 --> 02:01:19.84 no, not my opinion sounds like an opinion, but it's factually they're factually the best firm in the world.
02:01:19.84 --> 02:01:26.88 Yeah. What's cool is the guise are awesome, but there's a problem.
02:01:27.68 --> 02:01:30.80 What's the problem? The problem is you can't wear a ghee to the store.
02:01:32.72 --> 02:01:36.64 No. No. You can't wear a ghee to the restaurant. No, no, you're in it.
02:01:36.64 --> 02:01:41.12 And yet you wear the origin pants and you think, man, I wouldn't mind, you know, they had a pocket.
02:01:41.12 --> 02:01:44.72 I would roll out, right? Yeah. Especially if you get the black ones. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
02:01:44.72 --> 02:01:50.96 You know, it's not, it's not crazy to think, hey, maybe I'll just kind of roll out to the store
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:56.88 or maybe go take my wife out for dinner. No. Yeah. But that's okay. Because guess what we got now.
02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:05.68 Denom, origin jeans, dig it. Yeah. So those are common. Yeah, that's not quite out yet, but I got mine.
02:02:05.68 --> 02:02:11.28 Yeah, I don't have mine and you know it. I'm just texting Pete, right? I don't want to buy an
02:02:11.28 --> 02:02:14.64 ain't on pizza. He's busy, man. He does a lot. And I don't want to, I don't want to,
02:02:15.68 --> 02:02:20.80 my personal interest start to create roadblock or speed bumps in this whole thing.
02:02:20.80 --> 02:02:24.88 Don't. But I do want those jeans though. That's the thing. So I got a balance.
02:02:24.88 --> 02:02:30.08 It's the little dichotomy. My personal interest and the interest of Pete in his discourse.
02:02:30.08 --> 02:02:36.56 Unless I will have them, we will have them when do they come out then? Jocker in the process of coming out right now.
02:02:36.56 --> 02:02:42.88 Yeah. Yeah. The material. We are cutting the material. Now we're so in the material.
02:02:42.88 --> 02:02:48.88 Yeah, it's interesting because I don't really get excited about jeans or I don't get it like new jeans coming out.
02:02:48.88 --> 02:02:54.48 Or new iPhone car. I don't get excited about that kind of stuff, but for some reason I'm kind of excited about what I'm going to tell you
02:02:54.48 --> 02:03:03.76 why I'm a little bit excited about it. Because of this, jeans are American. Right? Jeans represent America.
02:03:03.76 --> 02:03:09.60 Let's face it. If you wanted to draw a stereotypical American human, they'd be wearing a pair of jeans.
02:03:09.60 --> 02:03:15.20 Yeah. Here's the problem. Jeans were made in America. Jeans were invented in America. Jeans became
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:23.12 famous in America. And then we sold our soul and put them overseas. Let them get manufactured overseas.
02:03:23.12 --> 02:03:31.92 Something that shouldn't have happened. And so to bring it back to America, does that feel good? Indeed. Yes it does.
02:03:31.92 --> 02:03:39.60 Yeah, man. Makes sense. I dig it. So yeah. That's the soul. Other clothes or teachers and stuff
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:44.64 more, and if you can get even if you don't want jeans, you can get joggers right now.
02:03:44.64 --> 02:03:48.32 Yeah, man. If you can't get me a great company. Supplements to Joint Warfare,
02:03:48.32 --> 02:03:57.60 Curoloyal Discipline, Discipline Go. Discipline Go. So when I work, sometimes I have to work for
02:03:57.60 --> 02:04:04.48 two three straight hours without any interruptions. Yeah. Yeah. You see what I'm saying.
02:04:05.12 --> 02:04:09.60 So I would be drinking discipline and all of a sudden I'm an hour and 40 minutes in and guess what?
02:04:09.60 --> 02:04:13.84 I got to hit the head. That's not a risk for you. So that's why we made Discipline Go.
02:04:13.84 --> 02:04:20.56 Discipline Go is just a pill. So it's called a capsule. Capsule. And it's got the, uh, it's got the
02:04:20.56 --> 02:04:27.60 goodness in it. And we also have coming the Discipline Go in a can. Yeah. Yeah, that's like a,
02:04:27.60 --> 02:04:32.48 if you had it yet. Yes. And that's, that's where you have the one where, like where was that?
02:04:32.48 --> 02:04:36.32 Did you, that gave you one in New York when we were in the New York. Yeah, I had one before that though.
02:04:36.32 --> 02:04:40.72 That's a couple. They sent me some. Yes. Good. I got more coming today.
02:04:40.72 --> 02:04:47.28 Hopefully it'll be here. But, um, yeah. So that'll be coming. Of course we got milk.
02:04:48.32 --> 02:04:54.48 Which apparently Dr. Luke hates mint chocolate chip passionately. Yeah. And it's a herd. I'm going off the
02:04:54.48 --> 02:04:59.44 other day. Like, why would you want anything that tastes like toothpaste? Mint just toothpaste. Yeah.
02:04:59.44 --> 02:05:02.80 So we have a little disagreement. We'll have to settle on on the map. But he's just going with
02:05:02.80 --> 02:05:08.64 peanut butter vanilla girl or something. And that's good. And don't forget about the warrior kid
02:05:08.64 --> 02:05:16.64 milk. No kidding. Yeah. It tastes like strawberry. Nestle's strawberry quick. That's what it tastes like.
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:21.92 Yeah. Can I say that? Is that legal? Yes. Okay. Whether it's legal or not. I can say it. I did
02:05:21.92 --> 02:05:28.96 say it. And it's tastes exactly like, and I'm using that. Exactly like strawberry Nestle's quick.
02:05:28.96 --> 02:05:35.52 But it has no sugar. It's got awesome protein. And it will make your kid into the next
02:05:35.52 --> 02:05:44.96 year. But this is something illegal right now. The next square away after. No, there you go.
02:05:44.96 --> 02:05:50.08 Smart. Yes. That's what the name names. You can do it. But so that's a word of
02:05:50.08 --> 02:05:54.40 main. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good. Yeah. That's a good. All my people, all my people up at
02:05:54.40 --> 02:06:02.16 origin that are working. Every day, someone, cotton, stitching, moving, shipping and making pretty much
02:06:02.16 --> 02:06:08.000 getting after it. Yeah. Big time. Also, we have a store called Jocco store. You know, stuff,
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:13.68 a little bit more formulated for representing the path itself. You know, a little bit skewed.
02:06:13.68 --> 02:06:17.76 But some good stuff on there. Some new stuff on there too. By the way. Oh, really? Yeah. They,
02:06:18.32 --> 02:06:24.56 the trailer travel mug. Okay. Kind of new. Good. I'm putting a hoodie up there. The black
02:06:24.56 --> 02:06:32.48 on black. Hmm. I like that. It's subtle. Heavy. Okay. Oh, heavy. Yes. Is it legit heavy? Legit heavy.
02:06:32.48 --> 02:06:37.92 Legit like it's the head. Is it a heavy? Yes. Heavy is one. An existence. I'm sorry to say no. But
02:06:37.92 --> 02:06:43.84 there has one that you've ever made. Yes. Okay. It's it's. I want to do this to be heavier to
02:06:43.84 --> 02:06:48.000 run the original. Yeah. It's black on black. All right. You got it. Two of them. No,
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.52 less good stuff on their rash cards on there too. For you, Jitsu. For you, Jitsu. Representing the path
02:06:53.52 --> 02:07:00.56 big time on now and also you can do other stuff with rash cards as well. But, um, yeah. Some good stuff
02:07:00.56 --> 02:07:07.60 on there. If you want to represent support, stand the path. That's where you go jockels door.com. Here's
02:07:07.60 --> 02:07:12.48 the thing about getting new stuff to and this is this is where this is where six year old echo
02:07:12.48 --> 02:07:16.88 brain comes out. Yeah. And there's a straight up. But it's still a place. It's still a pilot. If
02:07:16.88 --> 02:07:21.20 this dawns on me from time to time, especially when it hits me, when you get like a new
02:07:21.20 --> 02:07:24.96 thing, right? I've talked about this for when you get a new rash. You are six years old.
02:07:24.96 --> 02:07:28.96 Brow. You don't even act. You laugh. You know what I think? I think you think the same thing.
02:07:28.96 --> 02:07:33.68 I think you feel the same way. You won't necessarily admit it, especially not to me. But I think
02:07:33.68 --> 02:07:38.72 I think you feel the same way. Okay. If you got a new thing, you think of something that that
02:07:38.72 --> 02:07:43.28 excites me to get new. Oh, you keep doing what you're doing. I'll think of something over here.
02:07:43.28 --> 02:07:48.88 We'll think surfboard, think whatever. And then less there you go. So if you get a new rash card, a new
02:07:48.88 --> 02:07:57.04 ghee, even new socks sometimes. New shoe. I've gotten new socks. It's like 1843. I got
02:07:57.04 --> 02:08:01.60 guy. I get the socks from on it. I get fired up. Nonetheless, you get something new. Get a rash
02:08:01.60 --> 02:08:06.16 card. This is good after it. If you don't have one already, you will be looking for a
02:08:06.16 --> 02:08:11.20 going to do you do that much more. And that's the good thing about like these things that
02:08:11.20 --> 02:08:21.04 it never excites. It's 100% correct. Try it. Actually, I would say for anyone who has like,
02:08:21.04 --> 02:08:26.72 you know, sure to whatever they felt it. Oh, that's what I, that's how I predict. No, I, I, I
02:08:26.72 --> 02:08:33.52 understand what you're saying. And it actually is true when people, when you get that, you know,
02:08:33.52 --> 02:08:41.60 that's the classic, the classic scene from literature. Sure. Where is the, I think it's like the
02:08:41.60 --> 02:08:46.88 dawning of the uniform of the warrior. Yeah. And they do in movies too, the collage. They know
02:08:46.88 --> 02:08:52.24 the heroes put in his put on and then he's put his web gear on. And even just when people see,
02:08:52.88 --> 02:08:57.92 you know, the superheroes secret thing opens up and all this gears. Oh, yeah.
02:08:57.92 --> 02:09:06.32 Tell us all fire. Yes. Like the, the old that that's going to that chest in his or like in,
02:09:06.32 --> 02:09:11.76 in Mike in the dragons, you know when he's open opening up the chest and filled with war gear.
02:09:11.76 --> 02:09:17.68 Yeah. You know, I ruined that little fire. That's why I understand. Exactly. There we go.
02:09:17.68 --> 02:09:23.28 Same deal. Anyway, jockelstore.com. You want to represent on the path. Get fired up about
02:09:23.28 --> 02:09:32.32 stuff. There you go. See something like grab something. Also, jockel wake tea. We're still doing that.
02:09:32.32 --> 02:09:36.40 I'm still doing that big time because I was never a tea person. I mean, I'm saying that's that's
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:41.04 saying something because I was never a tea person. But guess what? Look at me, tea person. Oh,
02:09:41.04 --> 02:09:45.28 kind of I only drink this tea, but you know, I'm into it. You're a jockel white tea person.
02:09:45.28 --> 02:09:51.52 A big time. How's that deadlift? Huge. 800 pounds actually. You know, I've been sticking
02:09:51.52 --> 02:09:56.24 with it. Hey, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't iTunes Google Play Stitcher,
02:09:56.24 --> 02:10:01.84 it'll leave reviews so I can read them. Yeah, if you want, if you don't want, then don't
02:10:01.84 --> 02:10:08.96 what? Also, where are you, kid podcast? Subscribe to that. I was on a podcast yesterday and they asked
02:10:08.96 --> 02:10:14.000 me to say subscribe to their podcast. Yeah. And I said, I don't even ask people to subscribe to my podcast.
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.12 And I was like, well, actually, I got to say you know, and now I just did. Yeah. Maybe it's,
02:10:19.12 --> 02:10:23.36 you know, yeah, I actually, you and I had this discussion many times. I was like, why do we need to
02:10:23.36 --> 02:10:27.44 do you? You're like, well, people need to subscribe. Maybe they haven't subscribed. I mean, we're
02:10:27.44 --> 02:10:35.36 162 podcasts deep. That's got to be four, 500 hours of listening. You don't think someone hit
02:10:35.36 --> 02:10:41.44 subscribe yet. Well, I agree with you, Philly. So, we can we cut this out now? We, yeah, you wrote this
02:10:41.44 --> 02:10:49.04 by the way. But yeah, of course we can. Well, this is a carryover. Yeah, carryover. Oh, yeah,
02:10:49.04 --> 02:10:54.56 look, it's us doing what we talked about before earlier today about doing things like,
02:10:55.52 --> 02:11:00.88 because that's just how, you know, we got to think. Got to think. Why do we want to waste
02:11:00.88 --> 02:11:05.44 five seconds of someone's time telling him? You know, it just sounds kind of like, what is it? Like,
02:11:05.44 --> 02:11:08.80 what? Like, what? Like, what? It's redundant. There's nothing. It's kind of like, um, you think
02:11:08.80 --> 02:11:14.96 everyone, do you think anyone ever got to this point three hours deep into the podcast and you were
02:11:14.96 --> 02:11:20.48 I said and subscribe and they reach down to their like, they're just all my stuff. Yeah, oh, shoot.
02:11:20.48 --> 02:11:23.12 I can do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:26.000 let me tell you what you might forget. You might forget to subscribe with a warrior,
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.88 kid podcast because it's not coming out quite as consistently at this time. But it is
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.52 a great podcast for you or for your kids to listen to to get them on the path. Yeah.
02:11:38.16 --> 02:11:42.72 They can also, if you have kids, that's a good one. Oh, if you have kids, it's definitely a good one.
02:11:42.72 --> 02:11:47.28 If you don't have kids, it's not a bad one. Yeah, you can learn some real fundamental.
02:11:47.92 --> 02:11:53.04 Those are lessons that you kind of forget to, you know, that's what I think.
02:11:53.04 --> 02:11:57.52 Also, you get to warrior, kid, self, Irish Oaks Ranch.com. Got young, aid, and warrior, kid.
02:12:00.48 --> 02:12:05.76 Making soap. Yeah, interesting. Having his own business. Yeah, throw them some support.
02:12:06.48 --> 02:12:11.60 Whatever, Irish Oaks Ranch.com. Real soap, too. By the way, yeah, this like,
02:12:11.60 --> 02:12:18.16 ooh, let me buy the soap. Kit online and put my flavor in there and sell it. You can do that.
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:21.76 Oh, I didn't know you could do that. How that do you even know that? I, you know,
02:12:21.76 --> 02:12:23.84 yeah, I know, I've got to get into warrior knowledge.
02:12:25.52 --> 02:12:31.12 But the less, alright, don't forget about YouTube. And that's where you can see Echo's legit videos.
02:12:31.12 --> 02:12:34.64 And when you get to watch the video, make sure you get to the right.
02:12:36.08 --> 02:12:40.16 Nonetheless, we do have a YouTube channel. That's the point. That is the point. Because, you know, if you like the
02:12:40.16 --> 02:12:44.72 video version or you didn't know there was a video version, you can leave comments there, too.
02:12:44.72 --> 02:12:49.76 Yeah. I read them. I read YouTube comments. Even though Joe Rogan tells me not to.
02:12:50.40 --> 02:12:54.80 Yeah, because you do, that's a slippery slope because if a comment comes and it like,
02:12:54.80 --> 02:13:00.56 it's like, what's the worst can comment is the kind that's true or kind of true that like,
02:13:01.36 --> 02:13:06.64 just like, are you saying like, it won't, it's not a hard time. It's a indirect fire. It's an indirect
02:13:06.64 --> 02:13:10.32 fire, but more effective like, you know, in your neck or something. You know, it's like, that kind of,
02:13:10.32 --> 02:13:15.76 it has to be a little bit true. I actually, I think I've told you this before, but I was one night,
02:13:15.76 --> 02:13:22.16 I was reading YouTube comments to my oldest dog or about me. Because they were, and I forget it was,
02:13:22.16 --> 02:13:27.68 it wasn't our podcast. It was, it was a different podcast to podcasts that maybe people weren't as
02:13:27.68 --> 02:13:34.80 much on board with the programs. They had a lot of really colorful things to see. So, I think just
02:13:34.80 --> 02:13:39.44 Joe Rogan saying to you, like, don't read them and this is why he doesn't say that. He just,
02:13:39.44 --> 02:13:44.16 he doesn't say like, hey, hey, John, don't know. He's like, oh, you can't read the YouTube comments.
02:13:44.16 --> 02:13:48.56 Right. He'll say it like that. Yes, and that's what I mean. So, you're just knowing that allows you to
02:13:48.56 --> 02:13:52.80 go in and, and know, like, okay, you can read them and you just got to know that that's a successful,
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:57.36 but it's pretty much now when Jordan Peterson, like, says he reads it, but like, they impact him.
02:13:57.36 --> 02:14:02.16 Yes, he just didn't know. He didn't. No, Joe Rogan needs to tell him that you got to tell him,
02:14:02.16 --> 02:14:06.56 hey, that's like that's got a normal comment section as well. I'm saying it's not like on Instagram
02:14:06.56 --> 02:14:11.20 where it's like, hey, you know, it's like, it's just different. The dynamic, bro, are you to make these
02:14:11.20 --> 02:14:15.84 videos? You know this, but are you to make these videos like a, you know, parodies of like Darth Vader
02:14:15.84 --> 02:14:20.88 goes on dates and then I made this one, of course. You put those on my channel on our channel,
02:14:20.88 --> 02:14:25.36 on our channel. People still watch. I mean, they're funny. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I'm in Jeff
02:14:25.36 --> 02:14:32.16 with, but I made this one, uh, bikini light saber battle. Yeah. It's like, you know, um, glory in them.
02:14:32.16 --> 02:14:37.12 They're just fighting with light sabers at the beach or whatever. And, well, you know, people
02:14:37.12 --> 02:14:42.24 watch them, but man, I look at the comments on that man. It's like, people, I think someone wanted
02:14:42.24 --> 02:14:46.80 me to die. He said whoever made this should die. Like literally said that. I was like,
02:14:46.80 --> 02:14:50.80 hey, what was they hating about it? What were they hating about? That it was dumb.
02:14:50.80 --> 02:14:56.000 Oh, okay. Which it is, by the way. Yeah, it's like two girls. They're mad at something.
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.88 And they've got something dumb. Then they fight lightsaber and then like,
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:05.28 she won the girl kills the other one and then like spider man comes out. Is basically all the
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:10.88 props that I had at my house. It's like, let me make a video. Yeah. So it was like, you know, it was dumb
02:15:10.88 --> 02:15:15.52 for sure. But, bro, you don't have to say that. Concoments like, I got to die now because it's dumb.
02:15:15.52 --> 02:15:20.80 You know, the point of the point is, yeah, you got to kind of know that that's not a normal
02:15:20.80 --> 02:15:26.56 comments. Yeah. You too, there. But, you know, I get to get in a statement out of it. It's pretty fun.
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:31.36 Also, you got psychological warfare that's on iTunes, Google Play and B3 platforms. And that is a
02:15:32.08 --> 02:15:36.72 album with tracks about how to overcome various stages of weakness that you might occur
02:15:36.72 --> 02:15:40.08 that might occur during your day. That's all we're going to say about that one. It's good. That's
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:46.08 very concise. Yeah. It's jockel though, by the way, on the track. So that's something. Also, on it,
02:15:46.80 --> 02:15:52.24 on it.com slash jockel. This is where I get all my kettlebells and socks, like I mentioned. It seems
02:15:52.24 --> 02:15:56.64 odd like why we just get socks from on it because they're freaking dope. But you ever look at the
02:15:56.64 --> 02:16:01.68 socks on it. They're freaking good. Yeah. Really good. You want to flex on the water pattern.
02:16:01.68 --> 02:16:10.08 I got all of them. So weird flex, but okay. Yeah. No, when you want to flex at the with, uh,
02:16:10.48 --> 02:16:16.24 at the people at the TSA. I keep, I keep wanting to use the term flex like in its modern way.
02:16:16.24 --> 02:16:22.72 Because my kids use it. Yeah. And I keep wanting to use it. Yeah. Keep trying, man. Yeah. I think
02:16:22.72 --> 02:16:27.76 you're doing pretty good. But no, I haven't really appropriately used it yet. Well, you used weird
02:16:27.76 --> 02:16:33.36 flex, but okay. On to me, not about me. Like you're saying about someone else. No, but you're
02:16:33.36 --> 02:16:37.84 seeing too. No, because KT had a video that was called that. Oh, it's called weird flex,
02:16:37.84 --> 02:16:42.48 but okay. And that's when I realized it was a thing. That that that that's an actual thing.
02:16:42.48 --> 02:16:47.28 Yeah. Weird flex, but okay. No, you told me it was a thing. Yeah. It was like this. Yeah.
02:16:47.28 --> 02:16:50.40 I don't use it. I want to use it. But it's sort of humble brag, right?
02:16:51.04 --> 02:16:55.60 Like we're flex, almost. Yeah. It's like you're bringing about something kind of weird to brag
02:16:55.60 --> 02:16:59.84 about, but cool man. Dude, dude, dude. You did kind of thing. Oh, that's what the
02:16:59.84 --> 02:17:06.000 answer case this video was. Weird flex what okay was about he was in a, he's in a movie
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.56 and he was kind of like flexing. He was in a movie. Yeah. And he was like, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
02:17:10.56 --> 02:17:16.32 Yeah. Yeah. He was all fired up. Yeah. Be more like, hey, like, I can turn my eyelids inside
02:17:16.32 --> 02:17:24.000 out. Okay. We are flex. Okay. I think his flex was a little
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.04 funny. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you see what I'm saying. That's the answer. Nonetheless, on it,
02:17:29.04 --> 02:17:35.20 this is where you get your fitness stuff. You know how we're, we all have home gyms. Most of us. Yeah.
02:17:35.20 --> 02:17:38.40 And you know, you want to dig you on somewhere kennel bells, you know, some jump ropes,
02:17:38.40 --> 02:17:43.84 battle ropes, like stuff, more good stuff to keep you on the path, keep you on shape. That's where
02:17:43.84 --> 02:17:49.28 you go on it dot. If you, if you want to hit your mind and shape, you're brain in shape,
02:17:49.28 --> 02:17:54.56 then you should read if you want to read some books that I wrote, then cool. You can read Mikey
02:17:54.56 --> 02:18:02.24 in the dragons. Best children's book ever for children under the age of six voted by me and you.
02:18:02.24 --> 02:18:08.64 Yeah. And our children and our children actually someone asked my daughter, my middle daughter,
02:18:08.64 --> 02:18:14.000 the other day, what's your favorite book of your dad's? And she said Mikey in the dragons.
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.92 Interesting. Yeah. My daughter didn't, we didn't have any kind of official like,
02:18:17.92 --> 02:18:23.12 oh, what's the best one? But the one that she always reaches for pushes for is where the warrior
02:18:23.12 --> 02:18:27.84 kid to. Yeah. She likes marks mission. Yeah. So there's that. So there's Mikey in the dragons.
02:18:27.84 --> 02:18:33.12 There's way the warrior kid to marks mission. There's way the court warrior kid. One,
02:18:33.84 --> 02:18:39.44 we just call way the warrior kid. Soon to be way the warrior kid three writing is complete.
02:18:39.44 --> 02:18:45.20 John Bowzeck is knee deep in the art right now. And that will be coming out in the spring.
02:18:45.20 --> 02:18:51.36 I'm going to get it on Amazon for pre-order as early as I possibly can so we don't have another
02:18:51.36 --> 02:18:56.64 scenario like we had with Mikey in the dragons where we bought you all bought a lot of them.
02:18:57.44 --> 02:19:03.12 And I didn't have them on hand. Let's say, digging everybody, everybody by Christa. So
02:19:03.12 --> 02:19:07.52 look for that one way the warrior kid three will be coming out. And then of course we got
02:19:07.52 --> 02:19:13.52 discipline equals freedom field manual, which is awesome to see that impact people.
02:19:13.52 --> 02:19:20.32 And it's also a good gift to give to people that maybe need a little help. Yeah. Just kind of
02:19:20.32 --> 02:19:24.80 just stay in the direction extreme ownership and that I got to me a leadership. Those are the
02:19:24.80 --> 02:19:29.92 leadership books that I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin. And they will help you
02:19:31.20 --> 02:19:38.88 with your organization and in your business and in your life lead. And when also we got Ashland

02:19:46.32 --> 02:19:54.000 Flynn, Cochrane, Mike's Rally, Mike Bima. There's a picture that echoes into. He's randomly
02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:01.28 in the picture on the website. Yeah, but he's not one of the leadership instructors. He is one
02:20:01.28 --> 02:20:10.40 of the leadership instructor, Filmers. Right. Hey man, I'm on the website. So that's really all.
02:20:10.40 --> 02:20:15.84 So what we do is we solve problems through leadership. Go to Ashlandfront.com for that. We also have

02:20:51.84 --> 02:20:57.36 we put together. Talk us about nine months to film, put together design. It's me in the rest of the

02:21:53.20 --> 02:22:01.92 interwebs on Twitter on Instagram and on Facebook. Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Jock
02:22:01.92 --> 02:22:11.52 Willink. And of course, thanks to all of our military personnel around the world who stand
02:22:11.52 --> 02:22:20.32 their ground to protect us. And also thank you to our police and law enforcement, the firefighters,
02:22:20.32 --> 02:22:26.24 the paramedics and EMTs, the correctional officers, the folks on board of patrol and all the
02:22:26.24 --> 02:22:37.04 first responders who stand their ground here at home to protect us. And everyone else, I always say
02:22:37.04 --> 02:22:52.48 that time is short. But most of us have more than six seconds. The six seconds that Corp.
02:22:52.48 --> 02:23:01.92 Jonathan Yale and Lance Corp. Jordan Hurger had to make the ultimate decision and the ultimate
02:23:01.92 --> 02:23:13.68 sacrifice they could have had more time. Had they run away. But they sacrificed it all.
02:23:17.52 --> 02:23:23.92 They gave up their time, but we still have time to time. They gave us.
02:23:23.92 --> 02:23:35.20 So don't waste it. Not six minutes of it, not six seconds of it, not one second of it,
02:23:35.20 --> 02:23:42.000 none of it. Get out there every second of every day. And get after it.
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:51.76 Good. Good until next time. This is echo and jockel. Out.
