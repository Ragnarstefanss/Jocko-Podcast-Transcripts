but was even worse than the fact there was hard work we were not prepared now we had wasted it took us another six hours to get everything deregged so we were not planning the way we should have been planning because we were running around like idiots wasting time wasting time orders issued by subordinates should not be mere repetition of those from higher authority with additions of their own new orders are clearer and more satisfactory as a rule is desirable to keep contemplated operation secrets long as possible and to confine knowledge they're of to new to a few staff officers and senior commanders however upon entry into action no unit should be endowed as to what the commander wants to do whenever knowledge of his intentions is necessary to ensure the cooperation of units engaged the commander does not hesitate to disclose them to all concerned ignorance of his intentions may often lead to inactivity on the port on the part of subordinates commanders intent is the actual thing that you lead with it's the most important piece of information of all of it and when we work with companies all the time there's this phrase that people know it's like if you ever hear yourself or the people around you saying you don't need to know that just do your job man the likely heard of success is basically zero check it is impossible to prescribe detailed forms of orders to fit every tactical situation to attempt to do so would result in rigid form and a routine style of expression which would not be in accord with the in accord with the tactical requirements presented by the diverse situations that arise in war you don't know what's going to happen that circles back i think to the first sentence you read and war is like you can't script the answer you don't know what's going to happen to the extent practical however it has been found efficient and convenient to classify combat orders according to their purpose and scope of for some of these to adopt a standard sequence of composition this makes for the ease of understanding a voice of omissions and ready reference their programmed to rebel against you they have to otherwise they'll be living at home when they're 38 years old you don't want that you want them to rebel against you but when they look outside for guidance you want them to find the right guidance there's Uncle Jake standing at a rigid parade rest ready to put out the word and if you're a parent you've now know and you're listening you now know you have those resources available to you because if you're like most parents when your kid rebels you know what most of us do we squash that which is the worst thing you can do personally first of all a way further and now you can say hey look I understand and now you've got some other you got some flanking maneuvers you can implement and have them because they're going to think they're figuring it out on their own which in some ways they are but the reason they're even getting there in the first place is because of you that's legit so way the warrior kid one two and three the first one's called way the warrior kid the second one's marks mission the third one is way the warrior kid through where there's a will got Mikey in the dragons how you gonna like just had this when I was on a field on this guy had he had called in the last time and had a kid on the way he was super freaked out and scared and he was like what should I do but you know he's just getting after it so stay clean irishoaxmanst.com youtube channel there's a youtube channel you can subscribe to you can see what Dave Burke looks like you can see what I look like you can see us laughing and carrying on you can see our expressions you can see what we look like when we're talking about kernel pogue my new arch enemy in the world and you can see echoes completely overly enhanced videos where things are blowing up it's the worst over use of special effects while they're being smashed while they're being smashed things are exploding but a lot of people like them including echo psychological warfare if you need that little a little shot in the brain if you need it you can get it from psychological war for an iTunes MP3 platforms of all kinds flipside canvas dot com that's Dakota Myers company and he's making shot in the arm that you can hang on the wall that's what it is a shot in the arm that you can hang on the wall so you wake up every morning you can see something that says discipline equals freedom I got some books the next book to come out is called leadership strategy and tactics field manual you can preorder it right now if you want the first edition I was talking to my publisher the other day and we're talking about what to do I said listen my people are there they want the first edition life is a war right it is a war that's what it is at least at a minimum it's a metaphor for war it's a fight and there are people out there and there are things out there that are trying to take you down there is friction and there are obstacles and there is complacency and you might think when I say life's war you like well not really but check this out listen to me in this situation that you're in your life is at stake your life is actually at stake right now what you do with your life is at stake you are fighting for your life every day the way that you live it the mark that you're going to leave the legacy that you're going to leave the people that you help the people that you help people that you can help move forward the people that are weak that you can make stronger all that is going to come back to you that is your life and your life is at stake right now every day almost as if you are at war so don't sit back and be on the defense and allow life to happen to you don't do that instead go on the offense every day by getting up and getting after it and until next time this is Dave Burke and Jocco out yes like you got to let him run his thing tell him what he needs and then give him all the time in the world you can't get let him go lead orders must be clear and explicit and as brief as as is consistent with clarity short sentences are easily understood you know they're like hey kernel kernel poke do you mind if we just say that short sentences are easy to understand because some of the guys might not get that and he's like whoa I'd like to talk to you about that for a while clarity is more important in technique the more urgent the situation the greater the need for consciousness for conciseness in the order think about that the more urgent the situation the greater the need for conciseness in the order think it was Mark Twain that said I wanted to write you a short note but again we're talking it's a little bit homing pigeon fish you know not not readily applicable as leaders but the but the leadership principles other than that one sentence that we pointed out other than that one sentence it's almost it doesn't change and it's very similar to the true inferior which is very similar to everything that we talk about all the time good leadership requires understanding people good leadership means you have to care about your men you have to as the book says show a constant concern for their comfort and welfare how about you make that a priority as a leader you can't unnecessarily tax the endurance of the troops discipline is the main cohesive force in a unit good morale cannot be improvised and and finally through offensive action through offensive action the commander exercises his initiative preserve his freedom of action and imposes his will on the enemy that's what we need to do is go on the offense on all fronts don't wait for orders don't wait for the intel to be perfect and if you have to be on the defense don't stay there look for that moment in time where you can flip this scenario go on the offense take ground move forward and impose your will on the enemy jitsu train you jitsu how many things you will be able to relate to jitsu is infinite it's going to make you better leader it's going to make you a better boss it's going to make you better follower it's going to make you a better dad make you better mom make you better human being and any it hopefully get your kids doing it too it's going to help them even more get them in the game and you'll be calibrated and then of course there's the two books that I wrote with my brother-lave babin extreme ownership and the dichotomy leadership talking about all the things that we've been talking about today leadership how to lead what to look out for how to overcome those obstacles we have Ashland front which is our leadership consultancy and what we do is self-problems through leadership all of your problems are leadership problems that's what we do Dave Burke got him got Andrew Paul who's on last time it's it's it's all of us that's what we do we do do it 24 hours a day seven days a week we are working with companies and then on top of that we have EF online which is it's interactive training online where you can learn the leadership principles that we talk about look the books are are great the podcast is a great come to the master all these things are good none of them work alone jeans the I'm going to call I think the name of the jeans is going to be May Kong 68 because if you don't know this the Vietnam Seals my forefathers the people that gave me everything I have today in the May Kong Delta of Vietnam the fatigues that we were that the seals were issued weren't durable enough for the operations that they were doing so they wore blue jeans and so May Kong 68 jeans and also we got boots we got origin boots they're awesome handmade in main check them out they're ready for pre-order right now so order some yeah hang on that it's not going to destroy the company if you're the leader that if you can have these limited recognized you're the one that covers all these little detailed points your people are tuning you out they're tuning you out and actually what's going to happen is they're going to miss the important things so you just need to say just the important things and i wrote tack one which is the operational turns and graphics which in the seal teams when the war kicked off we were not we didn't know what we were doing like in terms of operational terms and graphics we just kind of drew arrows and like made it obvious to the guys in the platoon like hey move there bad guys there we didn't we didn't realize that there was an actual an actual language that was utilized throughout all i remember when i was trying to convince people that we entire military yeah jitsu if you need you jitsu ghee then get one from a place called origin origin main dot com where we're not just up there selling geese what we're doing is up there bringing manufacturing back to America that's what we're doing that's where belongs highest quality it supports this podcast if you like this podcast go to origin and get something that supports the podcast but more important like I said it supports the United States of America it supports the community up there that's what we're doing so origin main you can get t-shirts you can get joggers which I personally don't wear but I got to I'm going to say hoodies and jeans by the way jeans best jeans ever do you everywhere the other day she is she had a right a little letter all the kids in the started school they had a right a little bio about themselves and kind of put it up in the wall to introduce themselves to the class and inside that biography it was talking about things that are important to you what do you think you like she used the phrase discipline she used the phrase ownership she said good people don't make excuses I didn't even know she wrote it So, you know, it was like, I think we got to write little notes to him, like little little comments, you know what I mean? and you're like now that I've thought about it that's the perfect ratio is just the least amount of things you can say to pass the peran information and then stop talking and if it's the the only way to compel your people to do it is that the risk is total destruction then the one in a million times that actually it could be total destruction they actually don't respond the way they need to they don't care because you've been saying that this could crush us this could destroy us like the one time that's that's true they've filtered you out years ago hey I don't get this I don't think this is right that's the best leadership you can have I want my guys to go hey hang on I don't understand this that's the best feedback I could possibly get which is them saying timeout I don't understand we need to keep talking about this as opposed to one of two things the sort of this blind loyalty whether just do whatever I say because there's no way I've got it all right or worse they think this guy's an idiot And if I was going to take away something from this that long section there if I'm a leader at a business or a key leader in an organization, the takeaway for me is it may feel like you at the top of the workshop needs to talk to most give the most information actually what you should do is the time that you should maximize is your subordinate leaders going to figure out what they need to do to support your overall mission. sorry we can't put people at risk because they want to come to the master that's not the way it works so if you want to come we're looking forward to coming down to Australia and getting after it with y'all and of course we have EF overwatch now which is we're taking proven leaders from the spec ops community the combat aviation community and we're placing them into companies that need to implement all these leadership principles that we're talking about you don't need somebody that knows your industry what you need is someone that knows how to lead they'll figure out your industry trust me they they know how to adapt and overcome they will get there and get in the game if you want that go to eF overwatch dot com and they go and they go do that and then problem solved totally any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to what is necessary to obtain an intelligent cooperation from the subordinates I'm reading that one again any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to what is necessary to obtain intelligent cooperation from the subordinates there's a little bit there's a little argument about that one because the the poll kernel poll was like they don't you need to tell what to do you tell what to do and the other guys like listen you need to give them some information on why this is happening so I can read your review and be a entertained or be informed about your critique points so that's good echo seems to think people don't subscribe so maybe it's hard to get people to subscribe to a podcast because they think it fills up their phone or something I don't know but anyways if you don't subscribe subscribe also check out the warrior kid podcast we are working always to try and get more warrior kid podcast done because I know parents are mad at me when I don't release them and then we have another store called jocquist or where you can get rash guards t-shirts hats hoodies whatever a bunch of stuff on there if you want to as echo troll says if you want to represent while you're on the path he seems to think that gets the the message across he could be right we know he might be right there's some evidence out there I saw on twitter the other day I posted something that his wife said hey you got a birthday coming up is or anything you want and his answer was we have a store it's called jocquist or and that was his answer to his wife said it's get out there that is legit jocquist This room in this room, there was some pug, some rear echelon dude that was sitting there going, hey, you know, the bottom line though, I understand that we want, you know, people got to understand. yeah one parting thought you're going through the books anytime I'm on the podcast which is completely awesome I get a lot of hits on social media asking me about the eminently qualified human being a project mm-hmm let me 74 174 one 74 podcast 174 let me tell you why you don't have that yet is because I simply haven't done a good enough job getting it done it is close but I am not doing my job we are getting very close that is coming out soon I will I will finish that project and I will get that done what about the app we are we finished an awesome beta test thank you for all of you out there that were dialed in on that we are close on that as well and what you're going to see pretty soon is the app getting released and hopefully a digital version of that well we've we've actually we actually see we had a little mission creep right little mission creep because as I'm looking at it I'm thinking hey this is cool this is awesome but guess what there's some protocols that we could give people to be grew so now we've got some protocols in there for kind of standard operating procedures for things that go down in your life and they're really good jeans Dave I cannot remember the last time of origins and I know that's you just wear shorts all the time when I lived in Virginia my criteria for shorts is it had to be below freezing so when you get a gig in New York City in January and you're flying out there what are you wearing on the point shorts really shorts at a national unfront t-shirt or a origin main t-shirt I might bring a hoodie if I think it's going to be chilly check so a hundred percent you're wearing shorts one hundred percent now here's here's one I look at a little caveat you know no no one's gonna know what that means actually everyone in NATO forces knows what that means the only people that don't know is the 16 guys in your seal platoon how about we get on board with what everyone else in the military is doing uh check And I think that was really the crux of what that last statement was trying to say is like, listen, you're going to have a platoon chief, a platoon sergeant, whatever, a company first sergeant, a chief operating officer or chief operations officer that's going to give you advice. no you you you you want to give yourself as many advantages as possible get on EF online dot com and learn these leadership principles deeper more granular leadership is a skill it requires reps reps after reps after reps musters an awesome rep this podcast is an awesome rep the books are awesome reps EF online gives you an unlimited number of reps to go get and you need to get reps when you're learning leadership period speaking to the master the next one we're doing is in Sydney Australia the other two sold out Chicago sold out Denver sold out Sydney's going to sell out extreme ownership dot com if you want to come and when it sells out there's no caveats Denver was sold out
