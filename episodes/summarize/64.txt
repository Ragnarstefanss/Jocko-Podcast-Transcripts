But so that learning curve was fast, but then it, but I also to kind of emphasize what you're saying and I look at it, when you said, you know, your first like platoon, you know, like 20% and then your second platoon, you know, for me, because I have four kids, it's very similar to what you learn with kids. Some of them are like, hey, for myself, you know, kind of like what you were saying like, I feel like I, I can't do it. And so the, you know, like I put my officer package in, but let's say like 20% of me was like, you know what, this is just a means to it So yeah, if you don't know, it's, you know, when you have moments of weakness, if you're what, getting up early in the morning, tired, tired, on a press, news or whatever, or you're going to, you know, you're about to work out, but you'll skip the workout because you're not feeling like it. But I mean, it was, I mean, I looked at these guys who had been in SEALs for like five, six, seven, eight years or there was like a Vietnam vet walking around like you're just, I just wanted to breathe the same air as those people. You know, it's weird to you as an, and I, you know, for guys that like you and I that are full on institutionalized in the military, it's almost like, when I was in, I didn't understand other options. You know, uh, so I went through the last, you know, the troop commander from that troop was like, hey, we're, you're going to come over. You know, that you talk about that mental judo thing, which, again, this is one that's going to be hard for civilians to understand how much, you know, it's like a bureaucratic force that exists in the military and really you have to be, you have to be able to to navigate through that. And so for us, all of a sudden, in a very quick learning curve, you know, you spend two weeks on deployment, you had more combat experience than, you know, than anybody else in the sealtains at that time, you know, other than the guys that were deployed right before you, but you had that's how quick the learning curve was. Like, I don't know how many times you have to go and not only present the brief that like talked to the guy who's going to say yes or no and develop that relationship. It is, it is like, for most guys that come in on a high school, because we're in your high school, you know, even if you're working at Wendy's, yeah, like I did, you're only making whatever 425 an hour in that amount. But you know, I know I could tell you exactly what rolled you for filled, you know, as a leader, but I don't know where you would have broken out on an orc chart. But yeah, that like you said no doctorate, then finally we had, you know, the trade at East Coast West Coast and, you know, sharing information and coming together and lessons learned and all that stuff that I think largely professionalize the force from a paperwork perspective, but has impact on the battlefield as well, too. I mean the platoons would count or like, you know, the SEA would be like, hey, we failed in warfare where you come out to Nalum with us for the ORE. I mean, it's awesome when guys that were experienced would come through like yourself, you're just so good to have guys like you coming through, especially because you were super experienced, really good tactically and super humble. I mean, like, where, I mean, where the, I did 20 years, one of my buddies is like, I said, hey, man, yeah, It wasn't like you were out there like, no, you were like, oh, this is awesome training. And history, just, like, like you said, the Vietnam guys, like they were just timed out. My body, like my ankle, I almost had to medit back my self out a couple of times, like roll my ankle extremely bad on an offset patrol in, like laying on target with my foot up in the air. And so we all realize, you know what, you're going to have to use that battery and keep track of how long you're using it for, because you don't want it to fail, but you're going to get, you know, 12 or 15 or 25 uses out of this thing. I know, I know we haven't really seen a bunch of each other in the last few years, but I think it's been like five years. I would say somebody commented, because I said the other day on, I, I forget, I don't know if we had someone on the podcast, but I was saying that, like, when I'm flying in an aircraft in a commercial airliner, I think if this thing crashes, I'm going to live. You know, it's from, like I said, going from conceptual shooting at paper targets and training hard and realistic to to be in on a two-way range for the first time. It's good waves, but like when you're 150 pounds, you know, in your 17, 18 years old, I've just really wasn't into, you know, fighting for waves. Like, ever, I've heard you say before, and I know we have the same position, like the default move should be aggressive, drive forward, not away. You know, when you look at the various reasons that a person could choose from, why you said like, you know what, I'm not done. I'm, like, at the 18 year mark, I told one of my close friends, I'm like, yeah, man, I'm, I'm going to retire at 20. You know, I'm like, yes, like I'm so happy to hear that. Yeah, it like we were going back and forth over text, I think took off like wildfire. Because friends, you know, other guys that we both know that I've talked to, they have, you know, various reasons. There's the ways that you got to play, you know, mental judo, you know, and interacting with people and to see these young guys who had no experience and afraid to, afraid to not probably the best word, but has it tended to make decisions.
