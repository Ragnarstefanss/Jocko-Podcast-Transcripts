[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 22 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick.
[00:00:08] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:11] Good evening.
[00:00:14] And I would say that it is a good evening.
[00:00:18] Because we are free.
[00:00:24] We are free.
[00:00:29] And I talk about that all the time.
[00:00:34] You hear me say discipline equals freedom.
[00:00:36] You hear me say free your mind.
[00:00:40] And here in America and in places around the world that have the ability to be listening to
[00:00:46] this podcast.
[00:00:49] A lot of times we take freedom for granted.
[00:00:58] And we all want freedom.
[00:01:00] We want the ability to move around and go where we want to go.
[00:01:07] But more importantly, we want freedom of the mind and freedom of the heart.
[00:01:16] And those things sound abstract.
[00:01:21] They seem like things that cannot be taken away.
[00:01:24] We don't even know what that means to have them taken away.
[00:01:29] Because of the way we live and how we were raised.
[00:01:35] To think what you want to think and believe what you want to believe.
[00:01:43] To be who you want to be.
[00:01:48] To have and to exercise the freedom to question.
[00:01:55] To question everything.
[00:02:01] That's freedom.
[00:02:07] And there are parts of the world where none of those freedoms exist.
[00:02:18] In worse, there's parts of the world where any chance of free thought is exterminated
[00:02:27] from childhood.
[00:02:32] Will, broken, dreams extinguished.
[00:02:44] That's controlled.
[00:02:53] So let's go to a place where that is the reality.
[00:03:03] And again, I'm going to point this out.
[00:03:05] This is not a dystopian movie or some post-apocalyptic novel.
[00:03:12] This is real.
[00:03:13] Real life with real people.
[00:03:27] Red is reserved for the lettering of the propaganda signs.
[00:03:34] The Korean language uses a unique alphabet made up of circles and lines.
[00:03:41] The red letters leap out of the grey landscape with urgency.
[00:03:47] They march across the fields, preside over the granite cliffs of the mountains, punctuate
[00:03:53] the main roads like my-litch markers, and dance on top of railroad stations and other public
[00:03:59] buildings.
[00:04:05] They say things like this.
[00:04:08] We have nothing to envy in the world.
[00:04:14] If the party decides we do.
[00:04:21] Long live Kim Il-sung.
[00:04:26] Let's live our own way.
[00:04:31] We will do as the party tells us.
[00:04:40] We will do as the party tells us.
[00:04:47] And like I said, this isn't a book.
[00:04:52] This is real.
[00:04:54] This is North Korea.
[00:04:56] This is a story of horror and of slavery and of brainwashing.
[00:05:05] And it's also a story of choices.
[00:05:11] Story of freedom.
[00:05:13] And it's also a story of the strength of the human will.
[00:05:20] This is a book that is called Nothing to envy.
[00:05:25] It's a story of the ordinary lives in North Korea.
[00:05:29] It's by Barbara Demick or Demick.
[00:05:44] It traces a bunch of people that defected who Barbara Demick was able to interview once
[00:05:51] they left North Korea.
[00:05:54] But it traces their lives and what their lives were like.
[00:06:00] And one of the characters, and again, I want to call the character one of the people.
[00:06:04] That's in the book.
[00:06:05] His name, Miran.
[00:06:07] And going to the book here, Miran's father was a POW.
[00:06:11] And it talks about that Miran's father never talked about being a POW.
[00:06:16] But there is another fellow POW who wrote a memoir.
[00:06:21] And in his memoir, and I'm going to the book here, he said that men were housed in
[00:06:26] squalid camps where they were not permitted to bathe or brush their teeth.
[00:06:32] Their hair became infested with ice untreated wounds swarmed with maggots.
[00:06:37] They were fed one meal of rice and salt water a day.
[00:06:44] Under the name, construction unit of the interior department, new POW camps had been built
[00:06:50] near the mines.
[00:06:53] Colmining in North Korea was not only dirty but exceedingly dangerous, since the mines frequently
[00:06:59] collapsed or caught fire.
[00:07:03] And that same former POW wrote, the life of a POW was worth less than a fly.
[00:07:11] Every day we walked into the mines I shuddered with fear.
[00:07:17] Like a cow walking to the slaughterhouse, I never knew if I would emerge alive.
[00:07:29] So if you don't know anything about anything, the leader in North Korea at this time,
[00:07:37] the most opposed war is Kim Il Sung.
[00:07:47] Is in charge of North Korea.
[00:07:52] But at this time, I'm going to the book.
[00:07:54] After the war, Kim Il Sung made his first order of business to weed out foe from friend.
[00:08:01] He started at the top with potential rivals for leadership.
[00:08:04] He disposed of many of his comrades and arms who had led the struggle from Manchuria
[00:08:10] to unseat the Japanese occupiers.
[00:08:13] He ordered the arrest of the founding members of the Communist Party in South Korea.
[00:08:18] They had been invaluable during the war, now that they'd served their purpose, they could
[00:08:23] be discarded.
[00:08:25] Throughout the 1950s, many more were purged and what was increasingly coming to resemble
[00:08:30] an ancient Chinese empire with Kim Il Sung, the unchallenged master of the realm.
[00:08:38] Kim Il Sung then turned his attention to ordinary people.
[00:08:45] In 1958, he ordered up an elaborate project to classify all North Koreans by their political
[00:08:51] reliability and viciously seeking to reorganize an entire human population.
[00:08:58] The North Koreans were methodical to a fault.
[00:09:02] Each person was put through eight background checks.
[00:09:06] Your song, Bun, as the rating was called, took into account the backgrounds of your parents,
[00:09:12] grandparents, and even second cousins.
[00:09:16] The loyalty surveys were carried out in various phases with inspiring names.
[00:09:22] Intensive guidance by the Central Party was the first announced phase.
[00:09:27] The classifications became more refined in subsequent phases, such as the understanding
[00:09:34] people project between 1972 and 1974.
[00:09:41] Those things to me, they all sound like just bad movie plots.
[00:09:50] The intensive guidance by the Central Party, that's something you don't want to mess with.
[00:10:03] Here's how they would be.
[00:10:05] Here's what life was like.
[00:10:07] A little bit of life.
[00:10:08] People would be closely watched by their neighbors.
[00:10:12] North Koreans are organized into what are called in Minbong.
[00:10:16] Literally, people's groups.
[00:10:18] The cooperatives of 20 or so families whose job it is to keep tabs on one another and
[00:10:24] run the neighborhood.
[00:10:25] The Inminbong have an elected leader, usually a middle-aged woman who reports anything suspicious
[00:10:32] to higher ranking authorities.
[00:10:34] It was almost impossible for a North Korean of low rank to improve his status.
[00:10:44] Now we talked about this character or sorry, the person, Miran, that's being talked about.
[00:10:51] And she talks about her father.
[00:10:56] Here's what she says about her father.
[00:10:58] Miran often found her father's Pacifici maddening.
[00:11:03] Only later did she understand this was a survival mechanism.
[00:11:08] It was as though he had hammered down his own personality to avoid drawing undue attention
[00:11:13] to himself.
[00:11:16] Among the thousands of former South Korean soldiers who tried to assimilate into North Korean
[00:11:21] society, many slipped up.
[00:11:23] Miran's mother later told her that four of her father's buddies in the mines, fellow
[00:11:30] South Koreans, had been executed for minor infractions.
[00:11:34] Their bodies dumped in mass graves.
[00:11:38] Being a member of the hostile class meant you would never get the benefit of a doubt.
[00:11:43] While sarcastic inflection when referring to Kim Il-sung or an astrologer remark about South
[00:11:48] Korea could get you in serious trouble, it was especially taboo to talk about the Korean war
[00:11:55] and who started it.
[00:11:57] In the official histories, and there was nothing but official history in North Korea, it was
[00:12:04] the South Korean army that invaded, acting on orders from the Americans.
[00:12:10] Not the North Korean army storming across the 38th parallel.
[00:12:15] Anybody who remembered what really happened on June 25th, 1950 knew it was wise to keep
[00:12:21] one's mouth shut.
[00:12:25] So even history.
[00:12:30] Even facts that you learned that the country learned were just lies.
[00:12:38] New Rand didn't have any particular artistic or athletic talent, but like her older sisters
[00:12:44] did, but she was a good student and she was beautiful.
[00:12:48] When she was 15 years old, her school was visited by a team of serious looking men and
[00:12:52] women in somber suits.
[00:12:55] These were aqua members of the fifth division of the Central Workers' Party, recruiter
[00:13:01] recruiters who scoured the country looking for young women to serve on the personal staff
[00:13:07] of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.
[00:13:11] If selected, the girls would be sent off to military-style training camp before being
[00:13:17] assigned to one of the leadership's many residences around the country.
[00:13:23] North Korean girls her age didn't know what a conq vine was.
[00:13:28] Only that whatever you might do to serve the leadership would be a tremendous honor.
[00:13:35] If the smartest and prettiest girls would be selected, I think we can all imagine what
[00:13:44] that looks like twisted men in seats of power, praying on the entire nations for young girls
[00:14:02] disturbing.
[00:14:04] Now another character in the book, and I keep using that term character, you hear that?
[00:14:11] Even me, I'm sitting here trying to tell everyone, hey, remember these are people, but
[00:14:14] I'm calling them characters.
[00:14:15] These aren't characters in the book, these are people.
[00:14:20] And this person was named Mrs. Song and Mrs. Song, what's interesting about Mrs. Song is,
[00:14:28] she's a true believer.
[00:14:30] She's a true believer, and you're going to hear some of this, but these folks that are
[00:14:34] raised in North Korea, they just believe that they believe the propaganda, they believe
[00:14:40] that North Korea's the best place on earth and that everyone else is suffering and that
[00:14:46] because of their great leader, their lives are better than anyone else in the world.
[00:14:51] And she truly believes that.
[00:14:54] And here's kind of what her attitude.
[00:14:55] Here's what her life was like and her attitude was like.
[00:14:58] Mrs. Song usually went to work with one baby strap to her back and one or two daughters
[00:15:03] dragging along behind her.
[00:15:05] Her children basically grew up at the daycare center.
[00:15:08] She was supposed to work eight hours with a lunch break and a nap in the middle of her shift.
[00:15:13] After work, she had to spend several more hours in ideological training in the factories
[00:15:18] auditorium.
[00:15:20] One day, the lecture might be about the struggle against US imperialism.
[00:15:24] On other time, it might be about Kim Il-Sung's exploits, actual or exaggerating, fighting
[00:15:30] the Japanese during World War II.
[00:15:33] She had to write essays on the latest pronouncements of the Workers' Party.
[00:15:37] By the time she got home, it would be 1030 p.m.
[00:15:41] She would do her housework and cooking, then get up before dawn to prepare herself and
[00:15:45] her family for the day ahead before leaving home around 7 a.m.
[00:15:49] She seldom slept more than five hours.
[00:15:52] Some days were harder than others.
[00:15:54] On Wednesday mornings, she had to report to work early for mandatory meetings of the
[00:15:58] socialist women's federation.
[00:16:01] Friday night, she stayed especially late for self-criticism.
[00:16:05] In these sessions, members of her work unit, the department to which she was assigned,
[00:16:10] would stand up and reveal to the group anything they had done wrong.
[00:16:14] Mrs. Song would usually say, in all sincerity, sincerity, that she feared she wasn't working
[00:16:21] hard enough.
[00:16:24] Mrs. Song believed what she said.
[00:16:27] All those years of sleep deprivation, all those lectures and self-criticisms, the very
[00:16:32] same tools used in brainwashing or interrogations had wiped out any possibility of resistance.
[00:16:40] She had been molded into Kim Il-Sung's improved human beings.
[00:16:49] While Song's goal wasn't merely to build a new country, he wanted to build better people
[00:16:56] to reshape human nature.
[00:17:02] Once in power, Kim Il-Sung retooled the ideas developed during his time as an anti-Japanese
[00:17:09] guerrilla fighter, as instruments into instruments of social control.
[00:17:17] He instructed North Koreans that their power as human beings came from subsuming their
[00:17:23] individual will to that of the collective.
[00:17:29] The collective couldn't go off willy, nearly doing whatever the people chose through
[00:17:32] some democratic process.
[00:17:35] The people had to follow an absolute supreme leader without question.
[00:17:42] That leader of course was Kim Il-Sung himself.
[00:17:52] So they're being told through multiple channels, through every instrument available newspapers,
[00:18:02] radio, television, all controlled by the state.
[00:18:06] And through all these, they're being told that they have to submit their individual will
[00:18:13] and perform at the will of the collective.
[00:18:21] And you know, you will hear me refer to, for me, the most important piece of humanity
[00:18:33] is the individual, an individual freedom.
[00:18:39] And obviously this attitude is the opposite of individual freedom.
[00:18:47] And also you got to remember from a leadership perspective, the way you maximize a team's
[00:18:54] effort isn't through a supreme authority trying to control everything.
[00:18:59] It doesn't work.
[00:19:01] That's why we have a little something called decentralized command.
[00:19:05] I want my frontline leaders to think.
[00:19:07] I want my frontline troops to understand what they're trying to make happen and use their
[00:19:12] free will to make it happen, use their own brain to make it happen.
[00:19:16] So if you're in a leadership position and you realize that you're trying to control everything
[00:19:20] yourself, you're not getting the most effective performance from your team.
[00:19:27] And we're going to see this on a grand scale.
[00:19:30] And you know, we do see it on the grand scale when governments try to control humans.
[00:19:37] It doesn't work.
[00:19:42] Now it might seem crazy that you would buy into this propaganda.
[00:19:48] And here's a paragraph in the statement about that, back to the book.
[00:19:54] We laugh at the excesses of propaganda and the gollability of the people.
[00:20:00] So consider that their indoctrination began in their infancy.
[00:20:05] During 14 hour days spent in factory daycare centers.
[00:20:10] That for the subsequent 50 years every song, film, newspaper article and billboard was
[00:20:16] helped was designed to deify Kim Il Sung.
[00:20:22] That the country was hermetically sealed to keep out anything that might might cast doubt
[00:20:27] on Kim Il Sung's divinity.
[00:20:31] Who could possibly resist?
[00:20:33] Are you not just being told that this guy is the leader you've been told he's God.
[00:20:43] In 1972 on the occasion of his 60th birthday, a traditional milestone in Korean culture,
[00:20:49] the workers party began distributing lapel pins of Kim Il Sung.
[00:20:54] More along the entire population was required to wear them on the left breast over the
[00:20:59] heart.
[00:21:01] In Mrs. Sung's home, as in every other, a framed portrait of Kim Il Sung hung on an otherwise
[00:21:08] bare wall.
[00:21:11] People were not permitted to put anything else on that wall, not even pictures of their blood
[00:21:16] relatives.
[00:21:20] The children were never to forget that they owed everything to the national leadership.
[00:21:26] North Korean children, they didn't celebrate their own birthdays, but those of Kim Il Sung
[00:21:31] on April 15th and Kim Jong Il on February 16th.
[00:21:38] When the time came, the children lined up in front of the portraits to express their gratitude.
[00:21:44] In Unison, they would bend from the waist, bowing deeply with feeling.
[00:21:50] Thank you dear father Kim Il Sung, the children repeated as their mother looked on with satisfaction.
[00:22:01] Televisions and radios in North Korea are preset, so they can receive only official government
[00:22:07] channels.
[00:22:09] Still, the programming was relatively entertaining.
[00:22:13] Besides the usual speeches of Kim Il Sung, on a typical weeknight, you might have sports,
[00:22:18] concerts, television dramas, and movies produced by Kim Il, Kim Jong Il's film studio.
[00:22:25] On weekends, you might get a Russian movie as a special treat.
[00:22:30] The newspapers would occasionally run feature stories about heroic children who ratted
[00:22:36] out their parents.
[00:22:38] To be denounced by a neighbor for bowed mathing, the regime was nothing extraordinary.
[00:22:45] I'm starting to get a little feeling for what we've got going on here.
[00:22:53] Now what happens when the government tries to control everything and you take the freedom
[00:22:59] of the people away, communism, obviously, and things are not as productive as
[00:23:08] they could be.
[00:23:10] That's what happens when there's no individual drive to succeed because if you're a farmer,
[00:23:17] once you plant your food, it's just going to get taken away by the government and redistributed.
[00:23:23] So what's your drive to grow the right amount of food or more food?
[00:23:27] There is none, because it's all just going to be taken away anyways.
[00:23:30] It's like they're all they avoid punishment, so they do the minimum, you know, rather
[00:23:36] than the opposite, when they strive for the maximum, that means they're focused on what
[00:23:41] can be, you know, rather than avoiding what can be.
[00:23:44] Yes.
[00:23:45] And so now this is again, I'm breezing through chunks of this book to get to some of the highlights.
[00:23:54] So now we're into the 80s and we're starting to run out of food.
[00:24:07] Kim Jong-il, who by the 1980s was increasingly assuming his father's duties offered
[00:24:14] on the spot guidance to address the country's woes, father and son were experts in absolutely
[00:24:20] everything, be it geology or farming.
[00:24:24] Kim Jong-il's onsite instructions and his warm benevolence are bringing about a great
[00:24:30] advance in goat breeding and output of dairy products.
[00:24:35] The Korean Central News Agency, Opine, after Kim Jong-il visited a goat farm near Chong
[00:24:41] Ginn.
[00:24:42] So that's the kind of headlines in the news.
[00:24:48] One day he would decree that the country sits switch from rice to potatoes for its staple
[00:24:52] food, the next he would decide that raising ostriches was the cure for North Korea's food
[00:24:57] surdaged shortage.
[00:24:59] The country lurched from one hair-brained scheme to another.
[00:25:06] So the fact of the matter is that even if this guy was a brilliant oasis brilliant farmer,
[00:25:11] he's not taking into account the various terrain and the different climates that are in
[00:25:15] the area and who can get what done.
[00:25:18] Whereas if you let the free market decide what can be grown and let individuals decide
[00:25:24] and let freedom guide people, things work, things find a way.
[00:25:35] The control does not work and you'll see that here back to the book.
[00:25:45] Soon the country was sucked into a vicious death spiral.
[00:25:49] Without cheap fuel oil and raw material, it couldn't keep the factories running, which meant
[00:25:55] it had nothing to export.
[00:25:57] With no exports, there was no hard currency and without hard currency, fuel imports fell
[00:26:03] even further.
[00:26:06] And the electricity stopped.
[00:26:09] The coal mines couldn't operate without electricity because they required electric pumps
[00:26:13] to siphon water.
[00:26:15] The shortage of coal worsened the electricity shortage.
[00:26:20] The electricity shortage further lowered agricultural output.
[00:26:24] Even the collective farms could not operate properly without electricity.
[00:26:29] It had never been easy to e-gout enough harvest from North Korea's hard-scravel terrain
[00:26:34] for a population of 23 million and the agricultural techniques developed to boost the output
[00:26:39] relied on electrically powered artificial irrigation systems and on chemical fertilizers
[00:26:45] and pesticides produced it factories that were now closed for lack of fuel and raw materials.
[00:26:53] North Korea started running out of food and as people went hungry, they didn't have the energy
[00:26:58] to work and so output plunged further.
[00:27:02] The economy was in a free fall.
[00:27:06] North Korea was the last play on earth where virtually all staples are grown on collective
[00:27:11] farms.
[00:27:13] The state confiscates the entire harvest and then gives a portion back to the farmer.
[00:27:18] But as harvest whithered in the early 1990s, the farmers themselves were going hungry
[00:27:24] and began stashing some of the harvest away.
[00:27:27] There were stories from the countryside of roofs that collapsed under the weight of grain
[00:27:32] hidden away in the eaves.
[00:27:34] The farmers also neglected the collective fields for their private kitchen gardens next
[00:27:40] to their houses or small steep plots that carved out of the side of uncultivated mountain
[00:27:46] slopes.
[00:27:48] Driving through the countryside, you could see clearly the contrast between private gardens
[00:27:53] bursting with vegetables, bean poles, soaring skyward, vines drooping with pumpkins next
[00:27:59] to the collective fields with their stunted haphazard rows of corn that had been planted
[00:28:06] by so-called volunteers doing their patriotic duty.
[00:28:13] Case in point.
[00:28:18] Koreans like to think to themselves as tough and so they are.
[00:28:23] The propaganda machine launched a new campaign, playing up Korean pride by recalling
[00:28:28] a fable from 1938 to 1939 in which Kim Il Sung commanded a small band of anti-Japanese guerrillas
[00:28:36] fighting against thousands of enemies in 20 degrees below zero, braving through a heavy snowfall
[00:28:42] and starvation, the red flag fluttering in front of the rank.
[00:28:47] The arduous march, as they called it, would later become a metaphor for the famine.
[00:28:58] And here's one of the statements that they would make no force on earth can bar the
[00:29:03] Korean people from making an onward march for victory and the revolutionary spirit of the
[00:29:09] arduous march.
[00:29:13] And the D.P.R.K. will always remain a powerful nation.
[00:29:20] Democratic people's Republic of Korea.
[00:29:25] Also people are starving.
[00:29:32] And the government is saying, yeah, we're going to drive on.
[00:29:35] It's a tough road, but we're going to make it.
[00:29:39] And during hunger became part of one's patriotic duty.
[00:29:43] Billboards went up in Pyongyang, touting the new slogan, let's eat two meals a day.
[00:29:51] North Korean television ran a documentary about a man who's stomach burst.
[00:29:55] It was claimed from eating too much rice.
[00:29:59] In any case, the food shortage was temporary.
[00:30:03] Agricultural officials, quoted in the newspapers, reported that bumper crops of rice
[00:30:08] were expected in the next harvest.
[00:30:11] When the foreign press reported on food shortages in the north in 1992, the North Korean
[00:30:18] news service was indignant.
[00:30:22] And here's what the North Korean news service had to say.
[00:30:25] The state supplies the people with food at a cheap price so that the people do not know
[00:30:31] how much rice costs.
[00:30:33] This is the reality of the northern half of Korea.
[00:30:37] All people live a happy life without any worries about food in our land.
[00:30:44] People are starving and the government is lying.
[00:30:49] If North Koreans pause to contemplate the obvious inconsistencies and lies in what they
[00:30:54] were told, they would find themselves in a dangerous place.
[00:30:58] They didn't have a choice.
[00:31:01] They couldn't flee their country, depose of their leadership, speak out or protest.
[00:31:07] In order to fit in, the average citizen had to discipline himself not to think too much.
[00:31:16] Then there was the natural human survival instinct to be optimistic.
[00:31:23] Like German Jews in the early 1930s who told themselves it couldn't get any worse, the
[00:31:27] North Koreans deceive themselves.
[00:31:29] They thought it was temporary.
[00:31:32] Things would get better.
[00:31:33] The hungry stomach shouldn't believe a lie, but somehow it did.
[00:31:40] Along with the new propaganda campaign, the regime stepped up at extensive network of
[00:31:45] domestic surveillance.
[00:31:47] The more there was to complain about the more important it was to ensure that nobody did.
[00:32:02] Now, at this point further in the book, Miran has gone off the college to become a teacher.
[00:32:10] And she shows up there.
[00:32:14] And this is what she deals with.
[00:32:16] The food in the cafeteria was even worse.
[00:32:20] North Korea was starting.
[00:32:21] It's, let's eat two meals a day campaign.
[00:32:25] But the school took a step further and offered only one meal.
[00:32:29] The thin soup made of salt, water, and dried turn-up leaves.
[00:32:34] The cafeteria would sometimes add a spoon of rice and corn that had been cooked for hours
[00:32:40] to pump up the grains.
[00:32:44] The girls and college began getting sick.
[00:32:48] One of Miran's roommates was so malnourished that the skin was flaking off of her face.
[00:32:55] She dropped out of school and others followed.
[00:33:07] Now during the, during the middle of this, Kim Il-sung dies.
[00:33:21] And it's crazy to hear how the people reacted.
[00:33:28] And so I'm going to start off with this announcement that was made.
[00:33:33] And this is long, a little bit of a long announcement.
[00:33:38] But just to get the tone of it is worth it.
[00:33:42] Here we go.
[00:33:43] The central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the central military commission
[00:33:47] of the party, the National Defense Commission, the Central People's Committee, and the
[00:33:51] administration council of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, report to the entire
[00:33:56] people of the country with deepest grief that the great leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung, General
[00:34:03] Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and President of the Democratic
[00:34:11] People's Republic of Korea passed away from a sudden attack of Il-nus at 2am.
[00:34:18] Our respected fatherly leader, who has devoted his whole life to the popular masses, calls
[00:34:26] of independence and engaged himself entirely as an energetic activities for the prosperity
[00:34:33] of the motherland and the happiness of the people, for the reunification of the country and
[00:34:39] independence of the world till the last moments of his life departed from us to our greatest
[00:34:48] sorrow.
[00:34:55] Very disturbing.
[00:34:58] And what's crazy is you hear all these bureaucratic names.
[00:35:01] That's what's crazy about it.
[00:35:02] So these government organizations picking away at the people.
[00:35:13] And here's some of the reactions the morning that went through and people like Mrs.
[00:35:21] Song who is a true believer.
[00:35:23] This is how they felt.
[00:35:25] The old women wailed.
[00:35:30] How could you leave us so suddenly the men screamed?
[00:35:33] Those waiting in line would jump up and down, pound their heads, collapse into theatrical
[00:35:38] spoons, rip their clothes and pound their fists at the air in futile rage.
[00:35:45] The men wept copiously as the women.
[00:35:49] The hystronics of the grief took on a competitive quality.
[00:35:54] Who could weep the loudest?
[00:35:55] Who was most distraught?
[00:35:58] The mourners were eggdone by the TV news which broadcast hours and hours of people wailing
[00:36:05] grown men with tears rolling down their cheeks banging their heads on trees, sailors banging
[00:36:10] their heads against the mass of their ships, pilots weeping in the cockpit and so on.
[00:36:16] These scenes were interspersed with footage of lightning and pouring rain.
[00:36:22] It looked like Armageddon.
[00:36:26] Our country is enveloped in the deepest sorrow in the 5,000 year history of the Korean nation
[00:36:33] in tone and an answer on television.
[00:36:40] And they had these little myths that they threw out there like this one.
[00:36:43] Here's an official release.
[00:36:45] When the great martial died, thousands of cranes descended from heaven to fetch him.
[00:36:52] The birds couldn't take him because they saw that North Koreans cried and screamed and
[00:36:57] pummeled their chests, pulled their hair and pounded the ground.
[00:37:04] They couldn't let him go.
[00:37:12] Nonetheless, despite the heroic efforts of the grand martial, the famine continued.
[00:37:27] Here we go to another person in the book whose name is Dr. Kim, a woman doctor in North
[00:37:36] Korea.
[00:37:37] In the pediatric world, Dr. Kim noticed that her patients were exhibiting peculiar symptoms.
[00:37:45] The children she treated born in the late 1980s and early 1990s were surprisingly smaller,
[00:37:52] even smaller than she'd been as the tiniest kid in her elementary school class.
[00:37:57] Now their upper arms were so skinny she couldn't circle them with her thumb and forefingers.
[00:38:04] Their muscle tone was weak.
[00:38:06] It was a syndrome known as a wasting where the starved body eats away at its own muscle
[00:38:12] tissue.
[00:38:14] Children came in for constipation that was so acute they were dulled over and pain, screaming.
[00:38:21] The problem was with the food.
[00:38:24] How's lives had started to pick weeds and wild grasses to add to their soup to create
[00:38:29] an illusion of vegetables?
[00:38:32] One was increasingly the staple again instead of rice, but people were adding leaves, husks,
[00:38:38] stems, and cobs to make it go further.
[00:38:42] That was okay for adults, but it couldn't be digested by the tendered stomachs of children.
[00:38:51] The babies were in the worst shapes.
[00:38:54] Their mothers themselves, undernourished, didn't produce enough breast milk for them.
[00:39:00] The beef formula was non-existent and milk was rare.
[00:39:06] In the past, mothers who couldn't produce enough breast milk would feed their babies a water
[00:39:10] down, congee made from cooked rice, but now most of them couldn't afford rice either.
[00:39:23] Here's Dr. Kim talking about the toddlers.
[00:39:28] They would look at me with accusing eyes.
[00:39:31] Even four-year-olds knew they were dying, and that I wasn't doing anything to help them.
[00:39:38] Dr. Kim told me years later, all I was capable of doing was to cry with their mothers
[00:39:43] and their bodies afterwards.
[00:39:48] Dr. Kim hadn't been a doctor long enough to have erected the protective wall that would
[00:39:53] insulate her from the suffering around her.
[00:39:57] The children's pain was her pain.
[00:40:01] Years later, when I asked her if she remembered any of the children who had died on her
[00:40:07] watch, she answered sharply, I remember all of them.
[00:40:18] Now me ran, has graduated from college and she's an actual school teacher.
[00:40:25] And actually, requirement of school teachers was that they need to know how to play the
[00:40:30] accordion, which is like a transportable instrument.
[00:40:33] So therefore, it's considered to be a good thing because you could carry it on a march.
[00:40:38] So all school teachers had to play the accordion of these.
[00:40:41] They sang songs like this, and they would sing it with the class.
[00:40:48] Our father, we have nothing to envy in the world.
[00:40:53] Our house is within the embrace of the workers' party.
[00:40:57] We are all brothers and sisters.
[00:41:00] Even if a sea of fire comes towards us, sweet children do not need to be afraid.
[00:41:06] Our father is here.
[00:41:09] We have nothing to envy in this world.
[00:41:14] Another one of the songs that they'd sang, where have we gone?
[00:41:18] We've gone to the forest.
[00:41:20] Where are we going? We're going over the hills.
[00:41:23] What are we going to do?
[00:41:25] We are going to kill Japanese soldiers.
[00:41:31] And another classic that was taught in the music class is called Shoot the Yankee Bastards.
[00:41:38] Our enemies are the American bastards who are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland,
[00:41:44] with guns that I make with my own hands, I will shoot them, bang, bang, bang, that idea of
[00:41:51] nothing to envy in the world.
[00:41:55] And again, as you read through this book, you hear the people saying that they believed
[00:42:00] wholeheartedly that they had nothing to envy in the world, that this dismal life of starvation
[00:42:07] or near starvation was as good as it gets.
[00:42:15] And here's what the hunger would look like in school according to Miran.
[00:42:19] Each child was supposed to bring from home a bundle of firewood for the furnace in the
[00:42:23] school basement, but many had trouble carrying it.
[00:42:28] Their big heads, rolled on top of Scrawney Necks.
[00:42:32] Their delicate rib cages protruded over their waist so small that she could encircle them
[00:42:36] with her hands.
[00:42:39] Some of them were starting to swell in the stomach.
[00:42:41] It was all becoming clear to her, Miran remembered seeing a photograph of a famine victim
[00:42:46] in Somalia with a protruding stomach.
[00:42:48] Although she didn't know the medical terminology, she remembered from her teachers'
[00:42:53] college course on nutrition that was caused by severe protein deficiency.
[00:42:59] Miran also noticed that the children's black hair was getting lighter, more copper-toned.
[00:43:06] It was always the same progression.
[00:43:09] First the family wouldn't be able to send the quota of firewood.
[00:43:13] Then the lunch bag would disappear.
[00:43:16] Then the childhood stopped participating in class and would sleep through recess.
[00:43:21] Then without explanation, the childhood stopped coming to school.
[00:43:26] Over three years in Roman and the kindergarten dropped from 50 students to 15.
[00:43:34] What happened to all those children?
[00:43:38] Miran didn't pry too deeply for fear, the answer she didn't want to hear.
[00:43:44] A decade later, when Miran was a mother herself, trying to lose her post-pagnancy weight
[00:43:54] through aerobics, this period of her life waited like a stone on her conscience.
[00:44:01] She often felt sick over what she did and didn't do to help the young students.
[00:44:07] How could she have eaten so well herself when they were starving?
[00:44:12] Is axiomatic that one death is a tragedy, a thousand a statistic?
[00:44:17] So it was for Miran.
[00:44:20] What she didn't realize is that in her, there's that her indifference was an acquired
[00:44:25] survival skill.
[00:44:27] In order to get through the 1990s alive, one had to suppress any impulse to share food.
[00:44:35] To avoid going insane, one had to learn to stop caring.
[00:44:40] In time, Miran would learn how to walk around a dead body on the street without paying
[00:44:44] much attention.
[00:44:46] She could pass a five-year-old on the verge of death without feeling obliged to help.
[00:44:53] If she wasn't going to share food with her favorite pupil, she certainly wasn't going
[00:44:57] to help a perfect stranger.
[00:45:01] And here's some...
[00:45:02] I guess I would say thoughts on a famine or realities of a famine.
[00:45:12] In a famine, people don't necessarily starve to death.
[00:45:17] Often some other ailment gets them first.
[00:45:21] Chronic malnutrition impairs the body's ability to battle infection and the hungry become
[00:45:26] increasingly susceptible to tuberculosis and typhoid.
[00:45:32] The starved body is too weak to metabolize antibiotics, even if they're available.
[00:45:38] And normally curable illnesses suddenly become fatal.
[00:45:44] Wild fluctuations of body chemistry can trigger strokes and heart attacks.
[00:45:50] People die from eating substitute foods that their bodies can't digest.
[00:45:55] The situation can be a sneaky killer that disguises itself under bland statistics of increased
[00:46:01] child mortality or decreased life expectancy.
[00:46:06] It leaves behind only circumstantial evidence of excess morality, excess mortality, statistics
[00:46:15] that show a higher than normal death during a certain period.
[00:46:20] Yet another gratuitous cruelty.
[00:46:24] The killer, famine, targets the most innocent.
[00:46:28] The people who'd never steal food lie, cheat, break the law, or betray a friend.
[00:46:35] It was a phenomenon that the Italian writer Primo Levi identified after merging from Auschwitz.
[00:46:42] When he wrote that he and his fellow survivors never wanted to see another one again,
[00:46:48] one another again after the war because they had all done something of which they were ashamed.
[00:46:54] As Mrs. Song would observe a decade later when she thought back on all the people she knew
[00:46:59] who died during those years, it was the simple and kind-hearted people who did what they
[00:47:06] were told they were the first to die.
[00:47:19] By 1998, an estimated 600,000 to 2 million North Koreans had died as a result of the famine,
[00:47:27] as much as 10% of the population.
[00:47:31] By the end of 1998, the worst of the famine was over, not necessarily because anything
[00:47:37] had improved, but as Mrs. Song later surmised because there were fewer mouths to feed.
[00:47:44] Everybody who was going to die was already dead.
[00:47:50] Now that's how the famine wrapped up, but to go a little bit in depth of what it was
[00:47:57] like once the famine was raging, people became homeless, which was strange because in North
[00:48:05] Korea they never had a problem with homelessness because if you wanted food, you needed to
[00:48:08] live in your home because the government would allegedly bring you food.
[00:48:11] Well once they weren't bringing food anymore, there was no reason to stay at home.
[00:48:14] So now you had people going out trying to survive.
[00:48:19] And this talks a little bit about that, especially for the children.
[00:48:25] It was a dangerous life that children couldn't sleep without worrying that somebody perhaps
[00:48:29] another gang member would steal what little they had.
[00:48:33] There were strange stories going around about adults who prayed on children, not just
[00:48:38] for sex, but for food.
[00:48:41] Hayak was told about people who had drugged children, killed them, and butcher them
[00:48:47] from meat.
[00:48:51] Behind the station near the railroad tracks were vendors who cooked up soup and noodles over
[00:48:57] small burners.
[00:48:59] And it was said that the gray chunks of meat floating in the broth were human flesh.
[00:49:07] The story's gotten more and more horrific.
[00:49:10] Supposedly one father went so insane with hunger that he ate his own baby.
[00:49:17] A market woman was said to have been arrested for selling soup made from human bones.
[00:49:23] For my interviews with the defectors, it does appear that there were cases in which people
[00:49:29] were arrested and executed for cannibalism.
[00:49:36] What did our wonderful leaders do during this?
[00:49:43] What did the leaders know about the people who started black markets and started growing
[00:49:49] these gardens and selling what they could to get people started to try and survive through
[00:49:56] exercising their personal freedoms.
[00:50:02] And here's one of the ways that they're here's their comments about this.
[00:50:06] This is coming from Kim Jong-il as well as any of the world's strong men.
[00:50:13] He understood perfectly the cliche that an absolute-dist regime needs absolute power.
[00:50:20] Everything good in life was to be bequeathed by the government.
[00:50:25] He couldn't tolerate people going off to gather their own food or buying rice with their
[00:50:30] own money.
[00:50:34] Having people to solve the food problem on their own only increases the number of farmers
[00:50:38] markets and pedellers.
[00:50:40] In addition, this creates egoism among the people and the base of the party's class may
[00:50:46] come to collapse.
[00:50:51] So he's trying to stop people from solving the problems themselves which they have the
[00:50:57] capability to do and they don't talk about it too deeply here but they go into the
[00:51:01] massive black market that was started and there was people that were surviving or people that were
[00:51:06] doing that that were figuring out a way to make money.
[00:51:13] And Kim Jong-il retaliated against that free market excessively to try and stop it.
[00:51:20] It was better that people die of starvation than they have the freedom to try and let their
[00:51:29] get their family to survive.
[00:51:32] And here's an example of what they did with one man that was trying to get money so his
[00:51:41] family could survive back to the book.
[00:51:44] The man was accused of climbing electric poles and cutting copper wire to sell.
[00:51:50] The theft caused extensive damage to the nation's property and was done with the intention
[00:51:54] to damage our social system. It was an act of treason that aided the enemies of the socialist
[00:52:00] state. The prosecutor read his voice bellowing through the scratchy speakers.
[00:52:07] Then a man acting as a sort of lawyer for the accused spoke, although he offered no defense.
[00:52:13] I have determined that what the prosecutor says is true.
[00:52:17] The accused is the hereby sentence to death and the sentence will be carried out immediately
[00:52:24] to create a third man. The condemned man was bound to a wooden stake at the eyes,
[00:52:32] the chest, and the legs. The firing squad would aim to sever the ropes in order.
[00:52:41] Three bullets in each location, nine in total, top to bottom.
[00:52:48] First, the lifeless head would slump over so that the body would crumple in an orderly heap
[00:52:53] at the foot of the stake.
[00:52:56] Neat and efficient. It would look like the condemned man was bowing in death
[00:53:03] as if to apologize.
[00:53:05] A murmur went through the crowd who thought the execution was excessive punishment for a minor
[00:53:13] theft. The electric lines weren't working anyways. The few meters of copper wiring the man
[00:53:20] had stolen probably had gotten him no more than a few bags of rice.
[00:53:25] A pity. He has a younger sister, somebody said, two sisters said another.
[00:53:30] The man's parents must be dead. Clearly, he knew nobody would influence to intervene on his
[00:53:38] behalf. He probably had a poor class background as well, maybe he was the son of a minor.
[00:53:48] The shots rang out. Head chest legs. The head burst open like a water balloon.
[00:53:58] Blood spurred out over the dirt almost spilling onto the feet of the crowd.
[00:54:04] What do people do to stop this? You have rebellion in the world. You have people turned against
[00:54:29] the government in the world. But in North Korea, that did not happen.
[00:54:39] And here's why the level of repression in North Korea was so great that no organized resistance could take
[00:54:46] root. Any anti-regime activity would have terrible consequences for the protester, his immediate family,
[00:54:56] and all other known relatives. Under a system that sought to stamp out tainted blood for
[00:55:04] three generations, the punishment would extend to parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters,
[00:55:11] nieces, nephews, and cousins. A lot of people felt if you had to give one life,
[00:55:19] you would give it to get rid of this terrible regime. But here, you are not the only one getting
[00:55:27] punished. Your whole family would go through hell. So with the fact that they're going to,
[00:55:40] if you protest, they're going to kill everybody. So there was no protest. So now the only thing you can
[00:55:51] possibly think of doing is escaping. And it goes through the various people in the book and
[00:56:04] how they escaped. But I thought what was interesting, in fact, the most interesting sort of mental
[00:56:11] transition to make was from Mrs. Song, and again, she was referred to as the true believer.
[00:56:19] And her daughter had escaped and made it actually to South Korea. And her daughter arranged to have
[00:56:30] Mrs. Song visit China. But she visited China sort of against the rules thinking that she was
[00:56:38] going to go back to North Korea. Because she truly believed that North Korea was the better place.
[00:56:47] She believed that South Korea was the enemy and it was evil. And so she spends, but she does go to
[00:56:55] China. And she spends some time in China. And when she's in China, she's staying in a house
[00:57:02] that her daughter set up for her to stay in and they have TV. And they have microwave oven,
[00:57:08] and they have dishwasher. And they have a rice cooker, which is miraculous to her. I mean,
[00:57:15] she's talking about it. She's saying, at a certain time, the light would come on and it would
[00:57:20] make a trip. And that means the rice was now being cooked. And by the way, at this time, they didn't
[00:57:25] have rice in North Korea. So there's this thing that just automatically cooks up your rice in the morning.
[00:57:32] And it was that combination of things that broke her. Because when she first saw that stuff,
[00:57:37] she said, oh, this is imperialistic. You know, this is capitalism. It's evil. They're trying to buy
[00:57:41] us and slay us with their capitalism. That's what she'd been convinced her whole life.
[00:57:46] And then she has the realization. And I'm going to close with this because after this, it goes
[00:57:57] through the stories of how they escaped and whatnot. But this realization, this moment in time
[00:58:05] when her mind becomes free. And here's how it goes. How much they all, how much had they all missed,
[00:58:17] herself, her daughters locked away in North Korea, working themselves to death for what?
[00:58:26] We will do what the party tells us. We will die for the general. We have nothing to envy.
[00:58:39] She had believed it all and wasted her life or maybe not. Was it really over?
[00:58:56] She was 57 years old, still in good health. This was her wake-up call.
[00:59:05] She was ready to go. So I ask, what is your wake-up call? What is enslaving you?
[00:59:25] What is controlling your thoughts? Is it the television set feeding your mind images of what life should be?
[00:59:45] Is it the internet drawing you in and controlling your time?
[00:59:50] Is it drugs or alcohol numbing your brain and diminishing your desires? Or is it weakness?
[01:00:07] A lack of discipline that prevents you from accomplishing what you want to accomplish.
[01:00:13] And I'm not saying that you have to rebel. I'm not saying that there aren't things in life
[01:00:25] that we just have to do. There are. But what I am saying is ask questions.
[01:00:34] Don't believe everything that you're told and don't follow the path just because it's there.
[01:00:46] Don't get in line just because other people are.
[01:00:50] Get up and wake up and be conscious of what is reaping into your mind.
[01:01:05] What's getting in there? What are you letting in there? What is forcing itself in there?
[01:01:10] And what does it want you to do? You have only one life.
[01:01:28] So don't waste it. Being controlled by someone else.
[01:01:35] That's one of those things. It's everywhere. You can easily be controlled by stuff.
[01:01:44] Like a big one is hate to harp on parents. But your parents. So nobody's perfect.
[01:01:53] So all your imperfections or a lot of your imperfections will be passed onto your kids just because
[01:01:58] you don't know any better. Like that Mrs. Song Lady. She just believed it. She didn't know any better.
[01:02:03] And so you can end up passing these things down like certain traditions or just methodologies of raising kids
[01:02:12] that you might hear otherwise. But that's your thing. You know that you believed it. It crept in your mind because
[01:02:20] your parents, their parents. And you don't ask questions. And you don't ask questions. You're just like, hey, that's how I was raised.
[01:02:26] You passed it on. Meanwhile, you're doing the wrong thing all the time. That's what happens when you don't ask questions.
[01:02:33] That's what happens when you don't ask questions. That's what happens when you believe authority all the time.
[01:02:41] And hey, this might come across as some people are sitting there saying, wait a second.
[01:02:44] Jocca won't you win the military for 20 years? Your damn right, that was. And
[01:02:50] there was a definitely I was a rebellious kid. And when I was in the military, I was always a
[01:02:58] question to everything that we did and why we did it. So and I think that's one of the things that helped me
[01:03:06] get to a leadership position and become a decent leader was the fact that I didn't just take everyone's word for it.
[01:03:12] And say, oh, yeah, that's what we're going to do. Okay. Right. No, you know what, we're actually going to change the strategy.
[01:03:16] We're going to change the tactics. What why was taught is an working right now. We're going to do it differently.
[01:03:23] Yeah, and we did that all the time. Yeah, but this is a broader scale. This is a broader scale.
[01:03:30] This is life. Not just in the book, but life in general. Life in general, like what are you doing?
[01:03:38] Where are you getting your direction from? Yeah. Who is, who's got a hold of your steering wheel?
[01:03:44] Yeah. Yeah. And that's make sure it's you that's got a hold of your steering wheel.
[01:03:52] Yeah, and that's one of those things where it's tough because you got a balance it as well.
[01:03:55] You know, so if you're just rolling around saying, hey, nothing's true until I figure it out.
[01:04:00] It's kind of like, you know, you got to consider the opportunity cost where some people, you got it,
[01:04:04] you know, you got to consider their credibility and then you got to kind of just go with it. And again,
[01:04:09] this is just kind of demonstrating like there's a balance there. Yeah, but just like, are you saying if something,
[01:04:16] if it's not working and someone presents you with some alternative, don't just be like, hey,
[01:04:22] I've done it this way. So, you know, leave me alone type of thing. You know, ask those questions and listen to them.
[01:04:29] You know, Shenzhen, sorry, you might find a little improved method and doing some stuff.
[01:04:34] Yeah, or you might find out that you've been sucked into a trap, you know,
[01:04:37] you don't want to be in. No, you've got to free your mind. You've got to free your mind.
[01:04:43] You've got to get out of that box out of that cage. You know, think of that. You know, I meet people now.
[01:04:52] And it's so bizarre because because I've traveled a lot and I've walked with a lot of different kind of people,
[01:05:03] you know, from all different walks of life. And I meet people sometimes,
[01:05:10] and I think to myself, man, this guy's pretty awesome. He's got all this, you know,
[01:05:14] I don't know what this person's goal is. And sometimes I'll ask like, you know, what do you want to do?
[01:05:19] I'm like, what do you, hey, how many some kid or what you want to do? And some people say,
[01:05:26] you know, well, I want to do, you know, I think they're, I think they're going to come out with this giant
[01:05:32] dream. And they come out with like a, um, little mediocre idea. And I, and I, and I haven't done this yet.
[01:05:46] I've talked to five people in the last six months that I thought we're going to tell me about their dream
[01:05:55] and that I was going to be like in shock. And I was going to be impressed and say, yeah, that's what I'm
[01:06:02] talking about, brother, go get it. And instead, I had to bite my tongue because they were telling
[01:06:11] me their dream, but it wasn't big enough. It wasn't big enough. It wasn't, it was too realistic.
[01:06:18] You know, you know, now you meet some people sometimes and they tell me their dream, and I go,
[01:06:22] man, you ain't got a chance of that. You need to, you need to tone that down. You need to get a grip.
[01:06:27] Right. These people are like, you can achieve anything you want. No, actually, you can't achieve anything
[01:06:32] you want. If you could achieve anything you want, you know, everyone would be sitting on a yacht or doing
[01:06:39] whatever big bad ass thing that they want to do. It depends the way you mean by can't, though. But yeah,
[01:06:45] yeah, it's true. I mean can't. That's what I mean. These, these people that are like you can do
[01:06:53] whatever you want. No, actually, there's limitations to that. All people are not created equal.
[01:06:59] Some people are smarter than other people. Some people are better athletes than other people.
[01:07:04] Hey, reality. Now, what can you hear the question isn't that the question is, what can you do?
[01:07:13] With what you've got? What can you do? And I'd much rather, I love to hear people over shooting.
[01:07:24] But don't trap yourself in a box where you're like, well, I'll be happy if I can do this.
[01:07:32] And there's the other part of this is it's sort of like North Korea. There's people that are
[01:07:37] trapped in a paradigm in their head of the world. They think that the world is this thing that they
[01:07:44] live in. They think that the world is this small, this small place, the people that they know.
[01:07:52] And the atmosphere that they live inside. And it's really, really small.
[01:08:01] And I think to myself, man, you got to get out. And I'll tell you a part of this came when I
[01:08:07] got out of the military. Because my whole life, the only guys I knew were seals. I mean, that's just
[01:08:13] who I knew. And so when I got out and I started meeting other people. And I especially started
[01:08:18] working with big business and started meeting really not just successful in terms of financial
[01:08:26] people. But people that had really done something. And I started realizing that there was a whole
[01:08:32] other level, not a higher level. But there's just another world. Like in the seal teams, oh, well,
[01:08:38] you know, I did, I did my seal opportunity to silk to commander. You know, you do these certain,
[01:08:43] I did task in a commander. You do these things. And that's what you do. And it's awesome.
[01:08:48] And that's a whole world. But there's other worlds. And I'm ever telling one of my
[01:08:54] seal buddies, we were out surfing. And this is after I'd been out for like two years. I had this
[01:08:59] exact conversation with them. I said, hey, man, like we were talking, we're out there surfing for an hour.
[01:09:05] And for 58 minutes, we're talking about the seal teams, the seal teams, the seal teams, the
[01:09:09] seal teams. And then I said, hey, man, the seal teams is awesome. But just so you know,
[01:09:18] there's other things in the world. And it's stuff that I'm saying, my mind was in North Korea.
[01:09:24] My mind was just seal team. And I'll tell you what, I'm glad it was because it made my life very
[01:09:31] simple. And I still, you know, obviously, I love the seal teams more than anything. But there are
[01:09:38] other worlds out there. And you can do other things in the world. And so now when I meet people in different
[01:09:44] environments and different jobs and each little, each little environment that I poke my head into,
[01:09:54] because we work in different industries all over different, you know, manufacturing and gas oil,
[01:10:01] and financial. And then all their own little worlds. And sometimes people are trapped in those
[01:10:07] worlds. And I just want to say, man, free your mind, free your mind and see what else is out there.
[01:10:15] Yeah, kind of like what you and Tim, Tim Kennedy, we're talking about. How you guys, you guys are
[01:10:22] in examples, people who have seen the really, really bad parts of the world and the really,
[01:10:28] really good parts of the world. Because you guys travel all over and you live in San Diego,
[01:10:32] which is, you know, arguably one of the one of the best places to live. So you have that expanded view.
[01:10:36] Meanwhile, some people, they only go on vacation when they travel. So they have, although a
[01:10:42] real positive and really nice view, but it's really narrow. Or other people who only lived in
[01:10:48] bad places, just like people who grew up in a real negative household, when they go out into the
[01:10:52] world, just their beginning view of the world is negative. Like money is just so hard to come by,
[01:10:58] because when they grew up, their parents were complaining about the rent and bills are piling
[01:11:02] off and all this stuff. So that's their attitude when they go out. And then that's how they kind of
[01:11:06] take on the world. Man, I know this and this is kind of a different thing, same subject, same subject.
[01:11:11] But I had a friend in high school and this people, I grew up in quite smiling and why. So
[01:11:18] some people straight up have their whole life haven't been off of quite. And no less the mainland.
[01:11:24] The mainland is this fantasy world place where Disney land is and Hollywood and all this stuff.
[01:11:29] So I had a friend, one of my good friends, he moved to the mainland, but it was just a small
[01:11:35] teeny tiny town, just a small is quite. So I remember one time where what state was the downed
[01:11:40] Colorado, Colorado, he moved to Pueblo, he's called. So I remember we were just having a
[01:11:46] conversation later and I was like, hey, yeah, let's go to Las Vegas, a lot of white people
[01:11:50] go to Las Vegas and I was like, let's go to Las Vegas or whatever, I was like, when do you
[01:11:54] what do you do? You run into car, he was like, I would never drive in Las Vegas. I would never drive
[01:12:00] in Las Vegas because it's too crazy. You know, there's freeways, there's no freeway on
[01:12:04] quite on a wall there, there's a highway, but and he a grown adult. So it is true.
[01:12:13] Can't even drive, you know, so that's like an example, that's how narrow his whole view was
[01:12:17] world, his whole world and that extended to his driving skill. You know, this was just
[01:12:23] the sohactic on a freeway highway Las Vegas, even, I don't even know how crazy that is. I mean,
[01:12:29] that's not a crazy place to drive really, you know, come here to like, I don't know, I would
[01:12:33] buy whatever, yeah, or so to LA, man, hit the 405 North on a Thursday afternoon.
[01:12:42] Yeah, there's no doubt there's so much out there and if you stay comfortable in your world,
[01:12:48] you can get used, you can get comfortable starving in North Korea. Yeah, that's what the scary
[01:12:53] thing is. That's the point that I think I'm trying to make is don't be comfortable because what you
[01:12:59] think is awesome right now, there could be so much more, you know, if you can envision and
[01:13:08] pay attention to what's going on in the rest of the world and break out of that paradigm that you're
[01:13:14] in and see that you can fly, you can fly around the world, you can do it. You know, don't get
[01:13:27] trapped in free your mind. Yeah. All right, let's get to some questions from the interwebs,
[01:13:36] in a web, speaking of interwebs, if you like supplements, good supplements, which I think we both
[01:13:43] recommend, right, as far as supplements go, get on it supplements and then we are sponsored
[01:13:52] as it so happens by on it. But I would say get on it supplements anyway because I was taking them
[01:13:57] even before we're sponsored by on it. On it dot com slash jockel and get 10% off. Get your
[01:14:04] krull oil supplements. Get your alpha brain. Yeah, krull oil and krill oil is anything for your
[01:14:10] joints is critical because like when you even even when I was young, when you live hard, when you
[01:14:15] get after it, working out. So, okay, so if you gain strength, right, which of course we all kind
[01:14:24] of want to do or whatever, you don't have to put a whatever on the end. We just all want to.
[01:14:30] Period. Jeremy, that's not to speak for everyone, but I think it's safe to assume that yes,
[01:14:35] we're getting straight strength. But when you have a higher capacity for strength, a lot of times
[01:14:39] your muscles will just want to fire real hard. So what that can end up with is this weird
[01:14:45] stiffness, you know, so you're going to end like it's like you've got to it's almost like you've got
[01:14:49] a warm up in life. It's almost like that feeling, you know. So it's like yeah, you're strong. You're
[01:14:54] about to carry like the whole blow of groceries in and you can do that. It may be you know,
[01:15:01] you're road agrocy. You've got to come up. I'm just saying every day stuff. And you can you can
[01:15:06] get after it doing that, but you kind of got a warm up, you know, it's kind of like,
[01:15:09] kind of do you have any groceries you have? A lot, man. Get after it in the store out of the store.
[01:15:16] So anyway, so the point being like when you have stuff like for your joints or you don't take
[01:15:22] care of your joints. See, I would have told this totally differently. I like if you want to jack
[01:15:26] big steel, you want to do GG-Jitsu, you want to jump off things, you want to throw stuff around,
[01:15:31] get some creloys, so you stay healthy. Yeah, that groceries. No, but I'm saying no, it's it's
[01:15:37] it seems kind of productive because I've experienced this where I'm like, yeah, but then I kind of
[01:15:43] got to like do twists, you know, and then I'm strong, you know, then I'm ready to do it. Or if I'm like
[01:15:50] kind of stupid, it's kind of cold out and then I go to live, I'm like dang, I can live a lot of
[01:15:53] weights, but why on this first set, I can't even lift anything. You need to grow. I'm just saying
[01:15:58] your joints got to be like good to go. That was all in your inspiration. Right, it's absolutely
[01:16:05] true. I'm telling you, if you take that to a heart, well, you already take real oils. Yeah,
[01:16:11] yeah, anyway, yeah, on it.com slash jockel, get 10% off. You happy you did. And if you want to support

[01:16:31] People have been a few people mentioned that like the link doesn't work or whatever and I found
[01:16:38] out through one of the the true pursuer in the know. Sometimes you have ad blockers on your browser
[01:16:45] and they're activated, which is a good thing, by the way. It's good to, you know, because sometimes
[01:16:50] they can malware can get back anyway. Yeah, because it's an actual code and it works in, in, in the
[01:16:56] same ways. Don't talk too much. Yeah, anyway, so deactivated, you know, you're going to get past it.
[01:17:03] There it is, or if you want to buy some shirts, which jockels hit and or name on it, go to jockelstore.com.
[01:17:10] That's, it's cool way to represent. Anyway, yep, there it is. All right, let's get it first question.
[01:17:17] In any questions, okay, first question. How do you continue to change your jitsu when hurt or injured?
[01:17:24] Be the same thing with whatever kind of injury I got and whatever I'm going to do, I'm going to do
[01:17:29] what I can. You know, now one thing you do have to do is you have to let yourself rest enough that
[01:17:35] you can heal. Because sometimes they get the spring ankle and instead of lasting one month, it lasts
[01:17:40] 18 months, no kidding. If you push, if you just won't let it heal, the thing is not going to heal.
[01:17:46] So you have to let things heal. Now, but you can go through all kinds of positions, you can work
[01:17:55] different transitions, but sometimes you get an injury and if you're a jitsu person, you know what I'm
[01:18:00] talking about. Like, you get a weird injury that you can't do certain movements. Yeah, like,
[01:18:05] guy, I'll have a hurt back, can't get on top. I can't be on top. I can't. So you just practice your
[01:18:09] guard or you have a hurt, you know, groin muscle. So you can't hold any guard. You have to work
[01:18:16] like side control only. Okay, cool. Escape side control or be inside control. So you can definitely
[01:18:23] do those things. You just figure out what movements you can do. You figure out what training
[01:18:27] partners aren't going to go psychopathic on you and just hurt you even worse. So that's important.
[01:18:34] You know, just being in class and you're learning some new technique, you know, I find if
[01:18:38] I cannot roll, when I'm in class, I'll like pay a little bit more attention to what
[01:18:43] the instruction is being given because I know I can't roll. So I know all I'm going to get out of
[01:18:47] this is what I'm going to learn right here from Jeffy Glover or Dean List. And so I will be like
[01:18:53] paying extra special attention. Yeah, that's good. And then I'll tell you, this is something like
[01:19:00] I wear me pads when I roll. And I think that they prevent some injuries from happening. And I just
[01:19:05] made a transition in my life where I used to wear extra large pads. Neaparine knee pads,
[01:19:13] knee-uprene knee pads like knee-uprene. There were some sprays. Yeah, it's not like braces though.
[01:19:17] There's nothing bracing there. Just like a piece of knee-uprene. Yeah, yeah. But I recently
[01:19:22] like two weeks ago, I went, I used to wear extra large and I went to large because they felt
[01:19:27] a little bit stutter and I just got medium and I got some pretty big legs and I got medium and
[01:19:32] they're like really compressing my knees and keeping it all together and they feel really good.
[01:19:38] So maybe just over that legs are sized down to the compression and the same thing like when I
[01:19:43] have heard elbow, I'll put a elbow pad on. So wrap up whatever you can and just keep training.
[01:19:50] And warm up a little bit. Yeah, you know, I didn't use to. I do now. I'll do a
[01:19:58] five-minute round where I'm not trying to kill the person. I'm hoping that the person's not going
[01:20:03] to try to kill me. Although you and I had a little incident the other day we did a little excited
[01:20:07] in that first round. Yes. Just to clarify, when you say knee pads, elbow pads, they're not like
[01:20:14] the kind soccer. No, they're knee-prain. They're just a knee-up like a wetsuit, like a knee-uprene
[01:20:19] knee-prain. A6. Yeah. Clif-kene. Wrestling knee pads. That's what they are. That's what they're called.
[01:20:25] And they're generally made in knee-uprene. Gotcha. Yeah. So a lot of this, the training part of
[01:20:31] everything, that's a big deal. If you choose to train when you're injured, because, man, I can't sit
[01:20:36] here and say train when you're injured and I might even say, don't train, just learn like how you
[01:20:41] say, if you want to show up, because you got the ball. Yeah, you know, you can't just not show up on
[01:20:47] the mats. You know, the mats, even if you're not rolling, it's like, that's a good place to be.
[01:20:51] It's face it for most of us. And you sit in on a class or just do the instruction part of it,
[01:20:59] you know, and do the movements, because you're not going full speed, you know, rolling,
[01:21:02] do the movements that you can and you can pick up a lot, man. In fact, when you, especially,
[01:21:06] you know, how you say, we're learning from Dean, Jeff and mostly instructors here. They're
[01:21:10] really good. Even if you learn one little detail. Even if you know, I know this card pass.
[01:21:15] You know, he added that one little detail to him. Dang, I've been training for all these years
[01:21:19] and I just learned that one. You can always add something. The aim, I think, that's, that's a big deal.
[01:21:25] Show up and be there and you will learn. It's like I was talking to Greg one time,
[01:21:30] long time ago. He was like, we were talking about, hey, so if someone asks you, how long have you
[01:21:34] been training? But let's say you started training 10 years ago. But then you trained for a year.
[01:21:38] You took off a year and then you went back, but you were only training a little bit. You know,
[01:21:42] so how long have you been training? Really? How do you count it and all that anyway? So he was like,
[01:21:46] he didn't go too deep into it, but he was like, no, man, if you started 10 years ago,
[01:21:50] you've been training for 10 years. Because if you start training for a year, even if you take a year off,
[01:21:55] when you see something, you hear something, someone's talking about something. You're picking all that up,
[01:22:00] because you have the context of you know, you know. So your, your brain is similar to the
[01:22:04] into your system and you're fine, even if you're not training. Yep, exactly right. So if you're injured,
[01:22:08] just keep that going. That's a weird thing to do though. There's a little ego situation. If you're like,
[01:22:14] well, I've been training for 13 years, meaning I started 13 years ago, but I took a lot of time off
[01:22:22] it. So you might catch me. Right. Yes. Yeah. That's basically what they're saying. So just tell people
[01:22:27] like I've been training for 13 years. Yeah. You cannot make that kind of a war. You know what?
[01:22:33] Let's see how good I am. Yeah. You know, if in fact get it. Yeah, because I think it's
[01:22:38] coming getting so automatic for the person like, like, if you're at, if you ask me, how long have you been
[01:22:45] training? It's automatic for me to try to justify my skill with my number of how long. You know,
[01:22:50] even though the guy asking typically is just asking for conversation, he's not training
[01:22:54] evaluate how good you're really when I ask the wrong size. There's no, but you're different.
[01:22:59] Hello, you've been training for what's cool. But you're different. You compete.
[01:23:04] Well, I was talking to Keenan about that. Like, how do you do it? And they're kind of
[01:23:10] cycle, though. They'll be like, it's Matt hours. That's how you say it. You do you train for
[01:23:14] 10,000 hours. You do that's how long you've been training. I don't know if you're the series or not,
[01:23:18] but that's the one way I look at that. Yeah. I don't know. I don't feel the same way as you though.
[01:23:26] I don't feel what I definitely do. And I'll tell you what, like if I've said this before,
[01:23:30] if my back is tight, nothing better for your back than you do. Yeah. You next little sword,
[01:23:36] you do too. Yeah. Shoulders my little stretch. You do it. No, you, I'm not saying go out there.
[01:23:42] You can be able to kill it. You're going to be able to go like this. You're super hard crazy
[01:23:45] rounds. Not gonna work. Yeah. Yeah. Just be careful. How'd they be here? Yeah.
[01:23:51] Yeah, I am not a doctor. And probably if people listen to me, as if I was a doctor,
[01:23:59] their health would be deteriorating quickly. Yeah. It'd be in question. Yeah. Sure. From time to time.
[01:24:04] Don't sleep eat me train injured. Go. That's my attitude.
[01:24:12] All right. Next question. How crucial is knowing the personality type,
[01:24:18] introvert, extrovert of your colleagues in combat business or choosing an MLS, which is occupation?
[01:24:25] Yeah. How crucial is it to know the personalities of people?
[01:24:33] It's really crucial. Knowing and understanding people is critical in every aspect of life.
[01:24:43] And that being said, the most important part of knowing people is knowing that you really can't
[01:24:52] know people, not 100%. I hear people talk about personality types and there's these tests and
[01:24:59] these categories and stuff like that. And honestly, I've never been familiar with that.
[01:25:06] But you can put people in different categories. But for me, when you put person in a category,
[01:25:14] by themselves, that's only 50% of the situation. The other 50% is the other people that they're
[01:25:22] working with. So I want to know not just what type of personality they have,
[01:25:30] because that's a, like I said, that's half of the equation. The other half is how do they interact
[01:25:36] with other people and other people's personalities? How do they handle slackers? How do they handle
[01:25:44] overachievers? How do they handle loud mouths? How do they handle submissive people? How do they handle
[01:25:49] aggressive people? Those are all different personality traits. I want to know, I want to see how
[01:25:53] people are going to handle other personalities. And then I want to also know how they're going to handle
[01:25:57] certain situations. Pressure, conflict, authority, responsibility. I mean, I want to know
[01:26:06] not just what their personalities, but how they're going to react. Because you can get people that are
[01:26:12] a really easy example is people that are super aggressive, but they fold under pressure. And you can
[01:26:16] get people that are super passive that fold under pressure. And vice versa, you can get someone
[01:26:21] that's super quiet and humble and under pressure. They're just strong. So that's what I want to know.
[01:26:29] I don't care what kind of person now do you have? I mean, I do to an extent, but I want to know how
[01:26:35] it interoperates with the world, with the people and with the situations that you're going to face.
[01:26:41] And how do you do that? You do that by observing them while they're dealing with other people
[01:26:44] and while they're dealing with pressure situations. That's just a reality. And you can't,
[01:26:51] you can have an idea. You know, I won't say that you won't be able to predict it, but you'll get
[01:26:57] surprised. Sometimes you get surprised. A lot of person that you think is all tough and they fold
[01:27:03] or people, person that you think is weak and they're strong. So you will get fooled sometimes.
[01:27:07] A lot of times you're, you know, you're probably right 60% of the time, 70% of the time. Yeah,
[01:27:12] big one is also how they react when stuff goes bad. Like when stuff doesn't go their way.
[01:27:19] Yeah, you know, and that's a spectrum too, but you can meet someone and or things are going
[01:27:25] good. You're hiring new people with growth or whatever, whatever your situation. And it's like
[01:27:29] saying this guy, so I'm so glad I heard this guy, but when something goes wrong, they self-destruct.
[01:27:33] There's something like that. Man, yeah, that's, I think, a critical component.
[01:27:36] And so I, you know, the simple answer is that there's, there's so many different variables.
[01:27:44] So many different nuances that what you want to do is you want to know your people.
[01:27:49] Yeah. You want to build relationships with your people so you know them so you understand them.
[01:27:53] That's what you want to do. Yeah. The R word relationships.
[01:28:00] Yeah, that's what you need. That's how you get to know your people. And that's how you
[01:28:05] lead them correctly. Next question. In regards to subordinate leadership, how do you begin to
[01:28:15] change the culture slash school of thought of an industry or a company?
[01:28:24] You know, I'm not sure if they mean in regards to how do you change your subordinate
[01:28:28] leaderships or if you are subordinate. I'm not sure what which one of those it is, but
[01:28:33] regardless, it doesn't matter because guess what I'm going to do. I'm going to lead. That's what
[01:28:38] I'm going to do. Whether I'm on whether I'm the subordinate guy or the superior guy, I'm going to
[01:28:44] lead. Oh, we're going to, I want to change things and make them a certain way cool. I'm going to do those
[01:28:49] things. I'm going to make those things happen. That's how you do it. And if you're doing the right
[01:28:55] things for the right reasons, your message is going to spread. You know, how many bad
[01:29:01] school platoons I was in? I'm in zero. You know why? Because me and my buddies, we always had a good
[01:29:09] attitude. We always had the right attitude and that spread to the other people that were with us.
[01:29:17] Now, there's a red flag that you can get for yourself. And this is frustration. When you
[01:29:27] start saying yourself, which I'm not saying this necessarily, but this kind of question is coming
[01:29:33] from somebody that wants changed to happen, but it's not happening. So they're getting frustrated
[01:29:37] and they're thinking, they are not bored. They don't care. They aren't professional. They're not motivated
[01:29:43] like me. They don't have a good attitude. So there's a lot of blame going on right there. So this
[01:29:53] isn't about them, though. It's about you. And it's about leading from any level in the chain of command.
[01:30:03] If you're leading, if you're doing the right things, forward the right reasons, that's going to
[01:30:10] spread. So when the classic example I talk about it all the time is if your exercise in the
[01:30:15] extreme ownership, if you're saying, you know what? I got this. There was some stake made. It was my fault.
[01:30:19] That spreads. If you're humble, that spreads. If you have an open mind, that spreads.
[01:30:32] If you're being aggressive, not again, not aggressive towards other people, but if you're being
[01:30:36] aggressive in pursuit of your goal, that spreads. You know what doesn't spread is when you're
[01:30:44] aggressive at people. Oh, I'll actually, it does spread, but it's negative. You know what doesn't
[01:30:50] spread? It doesn't spread when you're trying to get people to do things because it's going to
[01:30:53] make you look good. That doesn't spread. You can't get people to behave better because you want to
[01:31:00] look good. It doesn't work. People see right through that. Oh, he wants to look good. You know what I'm
[01:31:06] going to do? Sabotage. Now the other thing I've been saying lately, because people are
[01:31:17] surprised or whatever, or not surprised, but they're concerned. They don't see how it's going to
[01:31:24] work so fast. And I say, you know what, it's not going to work fast. It's got to be, and here's the
[01:31:29] word. It's got to be a campaign. It's got to be a campaign. It's not like World War II was not one
[01:31:36] battle. World War I was not one battle. It's a campaign to win in Europe. It's a campaign to win
[01:31:43] in the Pacific. It takes battle after battle, after battle. And guess what, you don't win them all.
[01:31:49] You lose some of them. And so you're going to, on this campaign, you're going to win and you're
[01:31:53] going to lose. But you got to have the persistence and the patience and the persuasiveness to continue.
[01:32:01] And another piece of this is, you are best off if you go indirect and not be like, hey, you need to
[01:32:17] act like me. No. People don't like that. You need to just act how you're acting. And if you're doing it,
[01:32:26] like I said, the right things for the right reasons, people are going to see you and they're going to follow.
[01:32:36] So that's how you begin to change the school of thought. Yeah, that genuineness, like,
[01:32:43] tends to show itself or that, like, if you're not genuine, it tends to show itself. You know,
[01:32:47] just because of the dynamics of any of your words. That's what my words do. It just,
[01:32:51] straight shows itself. So when you're doing it for the right reasons, like you can't help but
[01:32:55] expose that, you know, that will be exposed. So yeah, people will sign on sign right on. And then
[01:33:00] you end up gaining, like, how you say, it's a campaign. It's like, you'll gain a little bit of
[01:33:04] ground. You might win this guy over. Like, hey, wait, that's, you know, that's a cool way of doing it or
[01:33:08] you know, whatever the group is. And you make these small little steps. You kind of hold that
[01:33:14] ground. And yeah, before you know it, it's kind of dang the whole culture of this, I don't know
[01:33:17] office or whatever. It's kind of changing. You know, it just, that happens. It's true. I've seen it happen.
[01:33:26] Next question.
[01:33:29] Jocco Echo, how do you work with people who overthink things?
[01:33:37] The classic overthinker. What does that mean? The overthinkers? They won't pick up this pan right
[01:33:44] here because they look at and say, hmm, I wonder what the way to that pan is. And if I should pick
[01:33:50] it up right now because I'm also thinking about saying something and what if I drop the pan
[01:33:54] while I'm trying to say something that makes a noise on the desk that disrupts from the flow of my
[01:33:58] sentence. And then the whole flow of my sentence is disrupted, which means my train of thought will
[01:34:03] be disrupted. Now I can't, we're finished when I was going to say that's an overthinker. So that's
[01:34:08] first of all, now you can just imagine applying that thought pattern to an actual project that you're working on.
[01:34:14] Right, right. Not a good scenario or you're trying to apply it to a combat situation that you're in.
[01:34:18] Or you're trying to apply it to a relationship that you're in. You start overthinking. Well,
[01:34:23] I see this and she might think that. Right. Yeah. They mean that. Yeah. That little book.
[01:34:27] But yes, yes. Yeah. That's true. Okay. That's an overthinker. So quit thinking so much. You're overthinking
[01:34:34] it. So here's what I do when someone's overthinking where I got someone that's like a like a
[01:34:39] chronic overthinker. I'm gonna, I'm gonna funnel them into the right mindset with questions and
[01:34:49] I'll give you some real easy questions to ask that'll make this happen. Things like, hey, we mean by that
[01:34:57] or like, can you explain that again? And you're getting them to explain it in a simpler way.
[01:35:01] Okay. Or you say, you know, hey, so hold on. So what's the actual goal? Do we try to get done here?
[01:35:08] Because again, they're putting layers upon layers of complexity on top of things that don't
[01:35:13] deserve it. So what exactly are we trying to do? And again, you're just kind of playing dumb a
[01:35:19] little bit and asking questions. And then if you can't get to them, if you can't quite get them to
[01:35:26] simplify it, then you say, oh, okay. So we're trying to do this very simple statement. So
[01:35:33] so that way they start subconsciously being coached and being taught to simplify things as much as
[01:35:41] they can in their head. And you know, another thing I've been saying lately, when I'm out
[01:35:48] working with people is I used to not really understand why people are drawn to this complexity
[01:35:56] but I actually think I understand now. And I think it has something to do with the fact that
[01:36:03] if I come up with a plan and it's super complex and super crazy and you don't understand it,
[01:36:08] then I must be smarter than you, right? Yeah. Right? I came up with something that's so genius and so
[01:36:16] complicated that you don't even understand it. I understand it. I understand it. Yeah, like what you
[01:36:22] do in it, right? And by the way, you know the only way you're going to understand it if I
[01:36:27] is if I break it down for you because you don't get it. So it's an ego trip and it's completely wrong.
[01:36:34] Because the fact of the matter is if I'm trying to get you to do something and you don't understand it,
[01:36:38] I'm a loser. I'm failing as a leader. So you, you, you got to try and get people to understand
[01:36:48] that simplicity beats complexity every single time and overthinking things is a failure in ability
[01:36:56] to simplify. So another thing and this is more kind of about planning and this is something I used
[01:37:03] to talk about in the SEAL teams and I call it 6% advantage over the enemy. And what this was was
[01:37:11] let's say you have a target building that you're going off of or going after you're going to
[01:37:15] go take down a target building in the middle of wherever the middle of the desert. And you basically
[01:37:19] come up with a plan that you're going to use your standard operating procedures. You're all going
[01:37:23] to get online or you're going to at least set up a base in a maneuver element. It's very simple. Two
[01:37:28] elements, one element is going to hold cover and the other one is going to move through the target.
[01:37:32] Cover and move. It's a simple as it gets. That's great. So you come up with a plan that's your plan.
[01:37:37] And then as you're looking at the imagery or you're looking at the map, you notice that there is an
[01:37:42] outhouse. 150 meters away from the house. So now what you do is you go, you know what?
[01:37:51] Because there's that outhouse there. You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to take another
[01:37:54] team of our guys. We're going to break them off from the main assault force. We're going to put them
[01:37:58] over there. And that's what they're going to be in case the guys in the outhouse bubble. So what
[01:38:04] you've done is you've separated your units. You've increased your communication problems. You've
[01:38:09] sacrificed your fields of fire. You disaggregated your fire power. You've diminished your unity
[01:38:15] of command. You've broke from your standard operating procedures. You've given up your real
[01:38:20] tactical advantage that you have for the chance. The chance that this guy at two o'clock in the
[01:38:28] morning when you hit the target is in the outhouse and not in his home. Is it worth that? No.
[01:38:34] So don't overthink it. We're hitting this target. You know what? Cool. He buys on that thing.
[01:38:41] No big deal. But don't give up your tactical advantage because you overthought the situation.
[01:38:48] Go with what you know. And another piece of that is a lot of times when people get super
[01:38:58] detailed like that and planning. They're actually planning things, planning on things that
[01:39:03] can't be known. So why would we make a plan for something that can't be known?
[01:39:11] I got a better idea instead of making a plan for something that can't be known. Make a plan. That's
[01:39:16] adaptable. You want your plan to be adaptable. And you know how you have the best adaptability
[01:39:23] for instance on the battlefield that you have the most control over your guys so that you can
[01:39:26] move them maneuver them quickly and how do you do that by having good unity of command and how
[01:39:31] do that by keeping your guys for the most part together. The many you start spreading them out all over
[01:39:37] the place and something changes. Something unknown that unexpected happens. Now you got to
[01:39:43] real everyone back in and try and get them to change the formation of their assault. It becomes
[01:39:50] very very complex. So if you set up your plan so that it's adaptable to changing situations,
[01:40:00] then you're going to be good to go. Same thing in business. Do you know what the market's going to
[01:40:08] do? No. We have predictors. Yes. Do we know them? No. Do you know what your competitor is going to do?
[01:40:16] No. Do you know what your consumers are going to do? No. Do we have intelligence? Of course we
[01:40:23] do. Do we have metrics? Of course we do but we don't know things. So keep your plans adaptable.
[01:40:30] So you can make adjustments when you need to. As opposed to overthinking things and creating
[01:40:39] specific branch plans for a possibility of something that might occur in the future or might not.
[01:40:45] Don't overthink it people. Sometimes people who underthink things. Sometimes they tend to say,
[01:40:59] hey, why do you overthink things when you're just normally thinking about something? Like you're thinking about
[01:41:06] something. Oh, so you're familiar. Yeah. So there's obviously you have to think about things. Right.
[01:41:11] And yes, you should be caution of someone cautious of someone that's just constantly saying,
[01:41:17] man, you're overthinking this. Right. That's been three minutes planning. Yeah. Watch out for that guy.
[01:41:25] Yeah. That's why you have one the word open overthinking comes up. Understand what that means.
[01:41:33] But I feel like your example is sound. Juggle. What do you think of Greg Jackson?
[01:41:44] That M. M. F. Famous M. M. Coach criticizing John Jones on his recent powerlifting and muscle
[01:41:50] gain. Yeah. So if you didn't see this if you're into M. M. M. May it all, they caught Greg Jackson on the
[01:41:58] mic after John Jones's recent fight saying, you know, basically, hey, I told you so. He's too big.
[01:42:06] He's all that powerlifting. And I've talked about Greg Jackson before and nothing but respect for
[01:42:14] Greg Jackson. Not only is he an outstanding coach and a great tactician, he's also just super humble guy
[01:42:22] who has built a really cool gym and built a lot of champions. So his record speeds for itself.
[01:42:32] So I'm not going to second guess, you know, what he's saying about a fighter that he's worked with
[01:42:37] since day one. And I think really it boils down to this sort of definition of perfection. If you've
[01:42:44] ever heard this definition of the definition of perfection is when you have nothing more to add
[01:42:49] and nothing more to take away. You've got it where it needs to be. And they use this with design,
[01:42:57] you know, design of whatever furniture of iPhones of, you know, anything, buildings.
[01:43:04] When you've got everything that needs to be there and you can't take anything away, that's the
[01:43:09] that's perfection. They say this about writing too. And you look at someone that writes really well
[01:43:14] every sentence you look at that sentence, you can't take away a word and you can't add a word.
[01:43:21] And that's perfection. And I think that is what Greg Jackson is trying to do with Johnny Bones Jones.
[01:43:28] Get him in that physical status where you don't want to add anything and you don't want to take
[01:43:35] anything away. So what they may have done according to Greg Jackson is they may have added a little
[01:43:42] too much muscle because of course you've got to have some muscle because it gives you strength
[01:43:49] that's in the explosiveness. But at the same time, muscle requires oxygen. And so you can actually
[01:43:59] get too big to where it's affecting your cardio. So I think that's all Greg Jackson was talking
[01:44:05] about it. And I think that's the balance that I'm always looking for. You know, I want to be
[01:44:10] big and strong enough, but I want to have endurance. That's what I'm trying to do. You know,
[01:44:15] and I try and find that balance by doing both strength work and endurance work. That's
[01:44:20] and when I say endurance, I mean muscular endurance. I don't mean marathon running because I don't
[01:44:23] run marathon's. Metcon. Metcon's, baby. So that's what I think he's talking about. And
[01:44:30] you know, like I said, respect for Greg Jackson and I'm sure that he had a
[01:44:36] he's got a good hand along why he's saying that. Yeah, fully. And when you, I do know a little
[01:44:42] about a little bit about this where, um, so if you gain some a bunch of muscle, fast like a
[01:44:50] short period of period of time, you can have a way harder time dealing with, you know, the
[01:44:54] drawbacks of that muscle. And that is endurance. That's the main thing. And at the same time, this
[01:45:01] doesn't have much to do with this particular situation. But if you gain muscle real fast, you
[01:45:05] can lose it. You have the potential to lose it real fast. But at the same time, you
[01:45:10] vice versa. If you cultivate this, you know, muscular body build, whatever, um, over time,
[01:45:17] like let's say you started lifting at 15 years old and you're, you know, 35 years old now.
[01:45:22] And you've always been muscular. Your body will have a, easier time holding onto that
[01:45:28] one for sure. If you stop like lifting for even a year, or if you stop lifting for a long time
[01:45:33] and then you get back to lifting, it'll, it'll jump right back up as far as your muscular,
[01:45:37] muscular muscularity. So, in regards to endurance, no matter what, bigger muscles require
[01:45:46] more oxygen, more fuel. So it's harder to get that endurance out when you have big muscles,
[01:45:52] just in general. But you're going to have the potential to gain that endurance way more if you've
[01:45:57] had muscle for a long time. So you do these big jumps in muscle gain, man, that endurance is going
[01:46:02] to suffer. It's going to be really hard to build up that endurance really hard. I'm not saying
[01:46:06] impossible, but it's just really, really hard. Yeah. So yeah, that is a dangerous thing, not dangerous,
[01:46:12] but it's, it's a, it's risky thing to do when, you know, I'm going to jump back into the fighting
[01:46:17] situation and I'm huge now. You know, I got that endurance weight stuff around that one. And,
[01:46:23] you know, obviously, or apparently it did there. Like, we, uh, maybe do one more
[01:46:31] here. Okay. Jockel, do you ever feel like Cicophys pushing a rock up a hill, only to watch it
[01:46:39] roll back down again and have to do it again. How do you overcome that? Do I ever feel like Cicophys?
[01:46:51] Yeah. Of course I do. I mean, I do. And I'll tell you, I've, I've thought about this and I've
[01:47:08] been waiting for people to start saying like, oh, you put another picture of the sweat and
[01:47:13] of a squat rack really, but I don't know if they understand. I've been getting on that squat
[01:47:25] rack and grinding it out for 25 years. And I'm not bored with it yet. It might seem like that's an
[01:47:40] unwindable battle, but really to me, it's not about winning. It's the battle itself. It's the struggle.
[01:47:56] It's the daily test. That's what life's about. Not just physically, but mentally.
[01:48:04] Getting that rock to the top of the mountain. That's not what my goal is.
[01:48:15] My goal actually is pushing the rock because pushing the rock
[01:48:22] pushes me. That makes me tougher. That makes me harder mentally and physically.
[01:48:37] It gives me much more than I give it. I want a struggle. I want a grinding claw and scratch.
[01:48:46] I want a digging and I want a push. And I don't want it to end. If I ever got the rock to the top
[01:48:56] of the mountain and it stayed there, I'd push it back down myself. I don't want to rest and
[01:49:07] I don't want a coast. And then I want to reach a point in my life where I say, that's it. I've done enough.
[01:49:19] I'm not going to give any more. I'm not going to push anymore.
[01:49:27] No. No.
[01:49:30] That relentless cycle of day to day challenges. They are madening to me. They don't frustrate
[01:49:42] me. They inspire me. Inspire me to drive and push more and to push harder.
[01:49:53] That's what that rock does to me.
[01:49:55] So why I say dig in and get to push and I think that's all I've got for tonight.

[01:52:29] made an effort to get like the quality shirts. Is that why they're sold out so much? Yeah, see in the
[01:52:36] big part of the world complaining about you. Yeah, I know and here's the thing I can't buy
[01:52:41] 5000 shirts because where am I going to put them right now, you know. So we it's a long story, but so
[01:52:47] yeah, sorry, I'm getting them. I'm getting them and I'm going to improve on that too, by the way.
