[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 274 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, I
[00:00:06] go. Good evening. All right. So the last podcast, 273 we were with Anthony Herbert, Tony Herbert,
[00:00:14] also known as and we started off his journey from a kid growing up in Pennsylvania. So if you
[00:00:22] haven't listened to podcast 273, go listen to that right now. He tried to join the Marines at
[00:00:28] 2014, 14 years old credit. Eventually doing the Army at 17, off to the Korean War, went from
[00:00:37] private to master sergeant, all kinds of heroic actions, suffered all kinds of wounds, shot, hit
[00:00:45] with frag, white phosphorus burns, and also bayoneted multiple times, including one bayonet
[00:00:53] stab that broke off in his chest. He in the Korean War served as a platoon leader, even
[00:01:03] though he was just a young and listed guy, and eventually at the end of that podcast and at
[00:01:09] the end of that part of his life, he was pulled off the battlefield, one of the most decorated
[00:01:13] soldiers of the war sent on a marat. It was basically a maral tour. And first we got flown back
[00:01:21] to the White House, met President Truman. And then basically went to London and Antwerp and Brussels
[00:01:27] and the Hague and all the other European allies that were fighting alongside America in the Korean War.
[00:01:34] Along the way, he met Mrs. Elinor Roosevelt. She encouraged him to go to college. He kind of agreed.
[00:01:42] One of the quotes he says in the book is he agreed because he was already the youngest master
[00:01:46] sergeant in the Army and he said, what am I going to do? Sit around the enlisted man's club,
[00:01:49] telling stories about Korea. So he was sort of not not over it, but he realized that he had
[00:01:55] kind of done what he was going to do. So he ends up getting assigned as an ROTC instructor at a high
[00:02:02] school in Denver because he liked to ski. Goes to the third Ranger class that ever happened.
[00:02:12] He was in. He ends up getting married to his hometown sweetheart, Mary Grace. Starts going
[00:02:18] to college or he gets out of the Army then starts going to college at the University of Pittsburgh.
[00:02:23] While he's there, he writes a book called Conquest to Know where, which was his first book about
[00:02:29] the Korean War, which he later rewrote, which we covered. When it was rewritten, it was called
[00:02:33] the Making of the Soldier. That was podcast 273 for the most part. Worked at a steel mill at night
[00:02:40] while he was going to college and then eventually commissioned as an officer in the Pennsylvania
[00:02:46] National Guard shot out to the two to eight iron soldiers. All right. So so then he goes to
[00:02:53] the knees back kind of in the Army and he gets some warnings at the Army's different now.
[00:02:59] You know, the war is over. Both the good people got out. We just left with people that shouldn't
[00:03:05] even be in the Army that he got those kind of warnings. But he stayed in. He loves being a soldier.
[00:03:11] He wants to be a soldier. Goes to the basic army infantry course. When's nine out of 10
[00:03:16] awards there, including the leadership trophy, which is the leadership trophy is awarded by
[00:03:24] the other students. Like the other students select who deserves this leadership trophy,
[00:03:29] then he gets assigned as a Ranger instructor and he starts, he starts in the mountain phase. And so
[00:03:41] today we're going to be reading. So the first book that we covered, we covered a little bit. So
[00:03:45] he's written two books. Like I see written three one was conquest and nowhere. That one got rewritten
[00:03:50] as the making of a soldier. That was the bulk of what we read last time. This time we're going to
[00:03:54] read from his second book primarily and it's just called Soldier. Just called Soldier. And lots of
[00:04:02] lessons learned. But as I mentioned in the first podcast in 273, there's some serious lessons
[00:04:10] learned about life and things get really crazy when he goes to Vietnam as a battalion commander.
[00:04:21] And we will get there. All right. So here we go. Going to the book, Soldier written by
[00:04:29] Anthony B. Herbert. And he says this teaching young men, the essentials of mountain climbing, combat,
[00:04:35] and survival was more of a learning experience for me. Then for them, I began discovering things
[00:04:39] about the resources in me as well as the way the army was moving. I was an alternate instructor at
[00:04:45] first, assigned to teach cliff descents on suspension traverses. I took it seriously. It was dangerous
[00:04:52] business if you didn't. The ropes to be used for traverses, which were one inch in diameter and
[00:04:57] 900 feet long, cost the army about $300 each. I had set up two of the traverses on a 60 foot
[00:05:05] cliff the day before a new class was to begin. And that afternoon, I went out to inspect the ropes.
[00:05:12] One of the criteria for determining the quality of the kind of rope that was the present was the
[00:05:17] presence of a tiny colored strand running all the way through its core. I inspected the first
[00:05:25] traverse and found the strand. But the second rope didn't have it, which meant that I simply couldn't
[00:05:32] approve its use. The strand was an indication that the machines used to put the hemp together
[00:05:37] into a strong enough cord had worked the way they were supposed to. If the strand wasn't there,
[00:05:42] something had gone wrong and the rope might be faulty. I went back to my quarters and wrote an unsatisfactory
[00:05:48] report on the rope and then went to the chief instructor and told them of my findings.
[00:05:53] The army paid good money for that rope and you want to throw it away, he argued,
[00:05:56] we're not going to do that Herbert. I explained what I had found or rather what I had not found.
[00:06:02] Strand shmanned, he said, you go out there and test it again by going down the traverse. If it holds,
[00:06:08] if it holds you, it's okay. This is kind of a strange safety check, right? Go ahead and risk your
[00:06:15] life to see if it's going to work. I returned to the cliff and went down the traverse. So he does it.
[00:06:20] It held. It was supposed to be sturdy enough to support a Jeep. I went back and told the captain
[00:06:25] and he ordered me conduct the class the next day using the rope. I filed the unsatisfactory
[00:06:30] report and went to bed. The next morning, as we stood at the top of the cliff, I ordered the
[00:06:34] class into two lines. The captain nodded his approval from nearby. One group would use the
[00:06:38] traverse made of the rope, I'd inspect it and proved. The other would be would use the traverse
[00:06:42] of the rope, I'd inspect it and reject it. A young corporal in the second group stepped off.
[00:06:48] The rope snapped and he fell 60 feet to the rocks below. I went down quickly on the other
[00:06:56] traverse. His body was so broken. It almost crumbled in my hands as I lifted him into a Jeep
[00:07:01] and sent him to the hospital. The captain had seen what happened. He left the scene running up
[00:07:06] over the hill. The students were nervous. They said, they weren't going through with it.
[00:07:12] I made them a little speech on courage and reminded them that they'd all known that
[00:07:16] Ranger training included risks. It seemed to work. We spent the rest of the morning learning how to
[00:07:20] use the traverse. There were no further accidents and at lunchtime I went back to base where
[00:07:25] Colonel Bierley and the captain asked me how the kid who fell was going to be. He'll be dead on a
[00:07:32] arrival, I said, don't say that. The captain said, you can't say that. How the hell do you know?
[00:07:37] Because I'm the one who put him on that Jeep for the hospital. He'll be dead on arrival.
[00:07:42] The phone rang. It was a hospital calling and the captain came back to Bierley and me with a
[00:07:49] strange look on his face. The hospital says he was dead on arrival. He reported. It was quiet in the
[00:07:55] office. Finally, the captain said, I was responsible for the accident. I realized that sir
[00:08:03] and I'll stand whatever comes from it. I said, you're responsible. You know he said,
[00:08:08] you're the one who's responsible. I know sir. I know. I answered.
[00:08:16] So I'm sure it's pretty obvious why I decided to pull out that particular quote because
[00:08:23] that is 100% accurate. Obviously he's taking ownership for what happened, but it's not just lip
[00:08:31] service. If you don't think something is right and you execute it, it's on you. It's on you.
[00:08:41] A little bit more from Ranger School and this book, look, this book is
[00:08:49] four, almost 500 pages long. And obviously I'm not reading the whole thing. There is so much good
[00:08:55] information and I'm just, I tried to parse it down to some key points along the way, but this is a
[00:09:03] book that is packed filled with knowledge. And I tried to bring out as much of that as I could,
[00:09:11] some of the war stories that I don't even go into. There's all kinds of combat scenarios that
[00:09:17] I don't even go into. Just an incredible book. Fast forward a little bit here. I didn't develop any
[00:09:23] really sophisticated theories about teaching and I still haven't. What seemed to be important was that
[00:09:29] the teacher know what he was talking about and be able to show as well as tell. One of the
[00:09:34] fouls he's an army training these days is that kind of experience is no longer part of the
[00:09:40] tradition. Kids are taught combat techniques by men who, through no fault of their own, of course,
[00:09:46] have never spent a moment in combat. And we wonder how it is that we turn out soldiers like Cali.
[00:09:52] Talk about Lieutenant Cali, Meal I Masker. What seemed most important then and still does
[00:10:00] was that the students realize that the army and war are not really games at all, even though they
[00:10:05] might seem that way at times, especially when you hear someone of the barroom tales,
[00:10:11] or when you hear some of the barroom tales of the way it was at Inchon, where that night in the
[00:10:15] Meekong Delta. I saw so many army teachers who were trying to make up for the times when they had
[00:10:23] been down at the bottom of the heap, when they had been the ones taking orders. They played games
[00:10:29] with their men, building their egos with nitpicking orders that produced nothing but descent
[00:10:36] and ranker among the men. So often I found it that way in the military, the rules and the rags
[00:10:43] and the juvenile coverups and the children's games that had nothing to do with creating a system of
[00:10:49] discipline or building soldiers. It was simply an ego game. Again, I think it's quite obvious,
[00:10:58] well, why I, you know, I'm talking about this. This is something that we all have to watch out for.
[00:11:05] You get put in that position of authority. You got to watch out. You got to watch out. Some good
[00:11:11] opportunity for you to pump up your ego. Make them do some stupid stuff that doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:17] And we'll do that all day long. If you like your ego run the show, that's what you're doing. And by the
[00:11:22] way, it creates what he say, descent amongst the troops. All right. So what he does in the next
[00:11:32] kind of stages of the books, he gets stationed in Germany, he kind of creates this provisional
[00:11:38] ranger, puttune, he becomes the commander of the provisional ranger, puttune,
[00:11:43] 1962 he gets promoted to captain. He's deployed to Africa. He's deployed to the, well, the
[00:11:50] Congo in Africa, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, the Persian Gulf deployed to Bahrain, all in the
[00:11:55] 60s. And there's all kinds of good stories in the book about these different situations that he's in.
[00:12:03] He's doing some kind of clandestine type operations. He's, it's just a, you know, borderline,
[00:12:11] spies, scenarios going down, working with the CIA, interacting with the CIA, intelligent services,
[00:12:19] and this kind of stuff. So he does all that. 1966 goes back to being a ranger instructor.
[00:12:26] It starts working towards his master's degree in psychology, gets his degree in 1968, gets off
[00:12:31] for the slot at war college. But of course he doesn't want to go to war college, not yet.
[00:12:36] Anyways, he wants to go to Vietnam. And the bunch of reasons, obviously, he has always felt that he
[00:12:43] wants to be a combat leader. And he sees an opportunity to lead. He also has never worked with
[00:12:51] helicopters at the level they were used in Vietnam. So, so he said quote, I wanted to know I wanted
[00:13:00] to go. I wanted to see I wanted to fight. Ask his chain to command. Hey, can I please go to Vietnam?
[00:13:07] And he does. He ends up getting orders to Vietnam. He wants to be a battalion commander,
[00:13:11] because by this time he's been promoted a few more times. He wants to be a battalion commander.
[00:13:17] He doesn't show up immediately in Vietnam as a battalion commander. He has to pay his dues first.
[00:13:22] And the way he pays his dues is my becoming the Inspector General of the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
[00:13:31] So Inspector General, what's an Inspector General? The Inspector General,
[00:13:37] their mission, Inspector General mission is to quote, provide impartial objective and unbiased advice and
[00:13:43] oversight to the army through relevant timely and thorough inspections and assistance investigations
[00:13:49] and training to promote and enable stewardship, accountability, integrity and efficiency.
[00:13:57] Also good order and discipline and enhanced total army readiness. That's what an IG of you ever heard
[00:14:03] that term before IG Inspector General. Yes, you have. Where'd you hear it? What movie?
[00:14:12] I don't remember. You might have been like mash or something like this. Okay,
[00:14:16] okay, I was trying to think of a good way to explain all those things and have you ever seen
[00:14:23] police movies where they have the internal affairs? Well, yeah, that's kind of the, I think that's a good
[00:14:28] comparison. Right? It's somebody that's kind of inspecting us like our team. Yeah, it's not, it's not
[00:14:35] hey, we're out inspecting, look what the bad guys are doing. We're looking at what we're doing as
[00:14:38] good guys. We're making sure we're doing the right things. Internal affairs always, it's
[00:14:42] or they came off as kind of like that wasn't a good thing when internal affairs is involved.
[00:14:49] It's kind of like they're investigating some some bad stuff. Yeah, something went something bad happen.
[00:14:54] Yeah, Inspector General comes out and I just hits me as something more like, hey, we're almost
[00:14:59] like a compliance officer like kind of like, hey, just to make sure everyone's kind of doing the right
[00:15:07] thing. It's not like it seems like they're kind of on your side still. Okay. No. Well,
[00:15:14] straight on that phrase. If you're doing the right things they're on your side. If you're doing
[00:15:17] the wrong things just like internal affairs. If you were doing all the right things and internal
[00:15:21] affairs came along, you'd be like, oh, cool, they're here to keep people straight. If you were
[00:15:25] if you were a criminal or you were, if you were corrupt, right? Well, training day, your favorite
[00:15:32] movie. Yes sir. But is there internal affairs in training day? No. So there should have been.
[00:15:39] Right? You got there should have been someone tracking, hey, what's going on? Where's this money going?
[00:15:44] Where's this, you know, what are these reports? Why aren't they? Yeah, like in the whole scenario for
[00:15:48] sure, but probably not in the movie for the given that particular storyline, but yeah, yeah, overall for sure.
[00:15:54] Yeah, that's that guy. What's Denzel Washington's character name in that movie? Do you know,
[00:16:00] Alonzu? Okay. Alonzu would be a not a big fan of internal affairs. Most of all, although he was,
[00:16:06] he was such a mover and so manipulative. He might have had some internal affairs people that were on his side.
[00:16:12] Yeah, he kind of did imply that not internal affairs necessarily, but kind of like he had some people
[00:16:16] on the inside kind of backing his moves when they were talking about getting drug tested. There you go.
[00:16:22] There you go. So that's what that's what the IG is. And looking, I was in the Navy for 20 years.
[00:16:27] Obviously, I saw some IG inspections go down or the IG would get called in like maybe someone's
[00:16:36] some ammunition goes missing for an extent. It's not the kind of thing where something happens one time
[00:16:43] and you know, the command would just kind of handle that. But if there's some kind of an ongoing problem,
[00:16:49] the I maybe someone's falsifying travel claims or something like that. Yeah, okay. So we're bringing in the IG
[00:16:56] who's going to give an unbiased look because, you know, maybe the commanders wrapped up in it or whatever.
[00:17:02] Yeah. So okay. So they're not just sort of around all the time or nothing like that. They call them in the first.
[00:17:08] It's called in the other place they could get used is let's say you work for me and I'm a tyrannical jerk.
[00:17:14] You could then reach out to the IG. Check. So you could reach out to the IG sort of through a anonymous.
[00:17:25] You know, let me email or something and say, hey, this guy, Jocco is verbally and physically abusive.
[00:17:35] That's a good tip. Two, two his subordinates. So there you go.
[00:17:41] So this guy shows up as the IG now. Now, like you said, it seems like they would be on our side.
[00:17:49] Right? Yeah. That was my misinterpretation though. I thought Inspector General sort of like just
[00:17:54] another guy who's there or another department kind of that's there all the time. That's kind of like, oh,
[00:17:59] hey, by the way, guys, you guys are kind of slacking over here. So let's tighten that up. We're all good kind of a thing.
[00:18:04] So if you were doing the right things, the right reasons you'd have no reason to fear the IG.
[00:18:09] But if you were doing some things that were shady, you might you might not be very welcoming or you might be scared of them.
[00:18:16] Yeah. And the IG is obviously it's a weird role to play, right? Because you're looking at your team
[00:18:24] and you're sort of a, you can end up in a situation where you're accusing your team of doing things
[00:18:29] that are wrong. So it's weird dynamic. And so he shows up as the IG for this brigade. And
[00:18:38] and this is the thing about Anthony Herbert. He seems like a very, what's the word here? He's like a
[00:18:55] straight shooter, right? Let's straight shooter that kind of a little bit of black and white,
[00:19:00] little bit of like, hey, right and wrong, good or bad, good or evil, he seems like he's got that kind of
[00:19:07] a personality. And actually you can go watch some of his interview. There's interviews of him on YouTube.
[00:19:14] And you can see some of them. But you're going to start to see that. And that's sort of in the first one
[00:19:21] that we when I did cover the beginning of this book just to talk about his upbringing. You know,
[00:19:27] he's a church going guy. He's, so he's a, he's kind of, he's kind of a, he's very straightforward.
[00:19:35] And right or wrong. That's what the personality comes across for the most part to me. And so this IG,
[00:19:47] you know, he's going to kind of, he kind of comes out of the gate swinging. He kind of comes
[00:19:52] out of the gate swinging. And here we go. He's checking into this guy. He's checking in with
[00:19:56] this guy who's a, who's the lieutenant colonel, who they call the mayor of on K, you know,
[00:20:02] some, some outpost over there in Vietnam. The guy is the commander of the brigade support battalion.
[00:20:07] So he's checking in. And the guys saying, you know, I can get you this. I can get you that.
[00:20:13] But then he says, I, I expect some cooperation from you in return. He added, like what I asked.
[00:20:21] Well, like talking things over before they go to the general he replied, most things never even
[00:20:28] have to reach his ears if you and I cooperate. You know, Herbert, sort of run things ourselves,
[00:20:32] trust each other, get along and keep it all in the family. See where this is going? I stared at him
[00:20:40] and said he had to be joking. I realized almost instantly he was not. I'm supposed to be an IG.
[00:20:47] I said he seemed not to have heard launching and said into a lengthy recitation of his immense
[00:20:53] responsibilities as the man in charge of the barrack, the brigade's rear area headquarters.
[00:20:58] Everything at on K was under his purview. He said men slept where he told them to sleep and
[00:21:03] took their meal wherever he assigned them and enjoyed themselves in his clubs and theaters and bought
[00:21:09] from his post exchange. It suddenly dawned on me that here was a senior lieutenant colonel,
[00:21:15] supposedly a professional soldier who was bragging about his job as a building officer, a task
[00:21:20] generally reserved for a second lieutenant in the states and usually for a not-to-keen second
[00:21:25] lieutenant at that. He rambled on and on about the scope of his influence and I tried hard to look
[00:21:30] interested and concerned. Finally he stopped. It was my turn. Look, Colonel, I understand your position
[00:21:38] and if you'll just assign me a room and a mess, I'll be glad to cooperate. I said he smiled
[00:21:43] and relaxed in his chair. But you have to understand my position too, I added. Now he was staring.
[00:21:48] I'm an IG. So I work for the commander who, by the way, is General Allen, not you. Since I work
[00:21:57] for the general, I'll report to the general and if that isn't a satisfactory arrangement for you,
[00:22:03] well then you can talk it over with the general and maybe the two of you can work something out more
[00:22:06] suitable. His jawline straighten noticeably. In the meantime, if you're finished, I have a lot of work to do.
[00:22:13] I concluded he looked ill. Is there anything wrong? I asked rising from the bed. No, not at all.
[00:22:20] He said rather gloomly, also rising. I have some things to do myself. I nodded open the door
[00:22:25] to the outer room and he left. The place was quiet until the sergeant spoke. You just made an
[00:22:31] enemy, sir. He said from his desk, a real danger, sent me. I walked into the outer room. Real
[00:22:37] dangerous, real dangerous, real real dangerous. I repeated smiling slightly. Yes, sir. He's okay, sir.
[00:22:46] He said, sheepously when he noticed my grin, no kidding, sir. He's really bad news.
[00:22:52] I took some papers from his desk and looked at him. So am I, serge. I asked. I said, and I'm not
[00:22:58] kidding either. You see where this is going, right? So you can see where this is going. He's forming
[00:23:12] antagonistic relationship with a guy right out of the gate. I talked about this on EF online the other
[00:23:20] day. We talked about, take the high ground of the high ground will take you. But when you're all in the
[00:23:27] high ground, you have to be careful that you don't, that you don't launch attacks on other people
[00:23:40] from a position where you feel like you're superior to everybody else. You are in a superior position.
[00:23:50] This is known, right? You when you're on the high ground, you're in a superior position. But let me
[00:23:54] tell you this, when you start to launch attacks with the attitude that you're superior, you're
[00:23:59] giving up some of the high ground. So and this is what's really a hard line to walk in this
[00:24:07] book. And as I try and talk through, so I'm not going to do a good job of it. But just because you're right
[00:24:15] doesn't mean you're right. And you're going to see this over and over again. I mean this guy is a
[00:24:20] like morally at least he appears to be and again there's some controversy around that everything we're
[00:24:24] talking about. He certainly appears if you read the words that he writes in this book. He certainly
[00:24:30] appears to be a morally upstanding human being that and look at what he did, look at his heroic
[00:24:37] actions from the last podcast, what he did in the Korean War. This guy is willing to sacrifice
[00:24:43] for his brothers in arms. He's an incredible soldier and you're going to see how much his men,
[00:24:51] how much his men love than revered him, which is awesome. But he's on that high ground and he's
[00:25:00] this is this is what he's doing. He's on the high ground and he's looking down on others from the
[00:25:05] high ground. And when you do that, they don't like it. People don't like it. Doesn't feel good.
[00:25:14] Yeah, that's interesting. What would you, how did you just put it? Like you just because you're
[00:25:20] right doesn't mean you're right. Doesn't mean you're right. Yeah, so there's got to be a better way
[00:25:24] to say that. It's like just because you're right doesn't mean you should smack people in the
[00:25:30] person. If it doesn't mean other people are going to think that you're right. Yeah, just because you're right doesn't mean you're right or
[00:25:35] what you said actually does sound kind of cool. I feel like that should be the quote. I used to
[00:25:42] like get into little debates, whatever, with my brother. I think I told you this before where
[00:25:47] you know, he is. Yeah, kind of where. There's no. We understand getting debates with your brother. Yeah,
[00:25:52] he's down for the cause and it goes hard. But anyway, so we'd we'd give him to these things,
[00:26:00] you know, sometimes against my will or whatever. And so finally I came to the conclusion,
[00:26:04] they said, hey, what you're saying is like right is right, but what you're doing is wrong.
[00:26:08] Yeah. Like I see what you're saying and you're saying all the correct stuff, there's all
[00:26:11] true stuff, it's all factual and all this stuff. But what you're doing right now is wrong. Like you can't
[00:26:15] like force people into debates. You can't like. So it's kind of the same concept essentially.
[00:26:19] You know, where it's like, yeah, this guy is taking the he's doing the right thing. You know,
[00:26:23] he's he's right. He's doing the right thing. But what you're doing kind of right now in a big and
[00:26:27] essentially in a bigger picture, there's just a bigger picture in play. Yep. And look, there's a,
[00:26:31] there's there's things that are universally morally wrong. So there are things like that. Well,
[00:26:38] almost universally morally wrong. There's things that you can say that that that is not correct.
[00:26:45] That is not right. That should not happen. When he starts, he's getting into some of this stuff
[00:26:51] early on. Look, you're right, Colonel Herbert, you're right, but you're, you're not going to
[00:27:00] make this easy. And if you, and if you, if you run around just slapping people from the high ground,
[00:27:09] what you're doing is you're, you're, you have to get off the high ground to slap people. You're
[00:27:13] coming down off the high ground to slap people. And what we're going to see how this unfolds.
[00:27:22] Fast forward a little bit. Within a few weeks, I realized that the desk sergeant had been worth
[00:27:27] listening to. He had a peg, pound for pound. The brigade was garbage. Discipline was laxed. The
[00:27:32] troops were slavingly disrespectful and sluggish. Mentally, as well as physically, it was obvious that
[00:27:38] on K, it was obvious that in on K, at least there were no match for either the Vietcong or the
[00:27:44] North Vietnamese regulars. As the sergeant said, they preferred pot to the one. But marijuana was
[00:27:50] only an expression of deeper, more serious failure. At on K, the troops wore what they damn well
[00:27:55] wanted to wear, including beads and bracelets. They cap their teeth with different colors, red,
[00:28:01] blue and gold. And they called the hierarchy motherfuckers and printed fucked the green machine
[00:28:06] on their jackets and hats. Some of them wore earrings, a few sported nose rings, and the battle
[00:28:12] flag of the Confederacy flew for many of the bunkers. The sergeant was right about nobody giving a
[00:28:19] damn to, almost everyone looked the other way. On K was a staff and headquarters post crammed with
[00:28:25] chair-borne commando types. In any other war, it would have been ridiculous, but not in Vietnam.
[00:28:33] Every careerist who could re-do his way was over there drawing combat pay while the citizens
[00:28:40] back home were getting blood for the bill. The troops knew best what to call it, a humbug.
[00:28:47] The 173rd was the largest brigade in Vietnam with over 10,000 men attached to it. It was according
[00:28:54] to the manual, a combat brigade with absolutely no dead weight. But it was a humbug. There were
[00:29:01] five so-called combat battalions in the brigade and not one of them had more than 600 physically
[00:29:06] present for duty. Out of a total of 10,000 men, there were no more than 3,000 at the battalion level,
[00:29:13] which means that some 7,000 were assigned to support roles. Stayed houses, pizza huts, clubs,
[00:29:20] headquarters, the general's mess, artillery, engineers, etc. Even among the approximately 3,000
[00:29:26] at the combat battalion level, not all were looking, not all were out looking with their rifles.
[00:29:33] Somewhere, of course, but the battalions had their own rear areas, just like the brigade,
[00:29:38] with their own stay-couses and their own clubs. Each battalion was composed of five companies.
[00:29:43] One of them, a makeshift out-out fit responsible for heavy weapons, which left four companies
[00:29:49] for walking. No company in the battalion of brigade had more than 75 men physically present and
[00:29:55] ready to go, thus each battalion fielded about 300 combat troopers. Except that each battalion
[00:30:01] assigned one company to guard its base of operations each day, that left the maximum of 225
[00:30:07] man available for the field. Or 1,125 on the brigade basis, and that would have been on a good
[00:30:14] day with everybody out and everybody with a rifle, but everybody didn't carry a rifle.
[00:30:19] Some totaled radios, some stayed back and typed, some worked in company supply, some were
[00:30:25] fireflies, the daily helicopter resupply lifts, and some were just planes screwed off. So on an
[00:30:31] average day, the 173rd airborne brigade could feel a proxmily 800 men. If all of its battalions were out,
[00:30:39] in the year I was in the brigade, all the battalions were never out simultaneously. We feel less
[00:30:45] than 800 out of 10,000 troops in the brigade. On a country-wide basis, it meant that out of 500,000 men,
[00:30:53] we had there at the peak of our involvement, less than 50,000 were engaged in the business of fighting
[00:30:58] in the field. And that figure applies only if all the other outfits were doing as well as the
[00:31:03] 173rd. As General West Morlin, like to say, the 173rd was the cream of the whole crop.
[00:31:09] It wasn't that our kids didn't fight well in the field. It was just that so damn few of them
[00:31:13] ever got there. We had a 500,000 man army, fielding less than one infantry division in
[00:31:19] dead in World War II or in Korea. On paper, we were hell on wheels. The report's on a column for it
[00:31:26] in the field. And on paper, it was 98% or more every day. I've filed those reports myself and they
[00:31:34] looked truly magnificent. All the guys at the stay-couse in the field, all the guys at the club
[00:31:40] in the field. The General's orderlies in the field, the lifeguards at Esther William Swimming Pool
[00:31:46] in the field. Stunning, absolutely stunning, and from time to time, I found myself and
[00:31:52] climbed to go along with it. It was so mesmerizing that when I later took over,
[00:31:56] but telling myself, I added another column to my reporting procedure just to keep things straight.
[00:32:03] As in the grass, I called the new column. It was no joke. It was necessary.
[00:32:08] And as in the grass, means you're actually in the field. You can see this guy, he's going hard in the
[00:32:17] paint. And again, I'm reading from the book. I'm not, these, I don't, we're going to get to sort
[00:32:27] of some of the pushback against this stuff, but we have to take him for what he's saying.
[00:32:32] Well, we have to, let me refer to it. We have to listen to what he's saying. He goes on here.
[00:32:41] I soon discovered that almost all the problems at any level of the brigade were either the
[00:32:45] director or indirect result of piss poor leadership. Being an IG, so you kind of, he's got this attitude
[00:32:52] and he's the IG. What, as you can be making friends, what's your prediction?
[00:32:57] Being an IG is an extremely educational experience. I was spending about twenty nights a month
[00:33:04] with assing the grass troops, blending him as well as I could, taking every opportunity afforded
[00:33:11] me to discuss tactics. I found that one of the best ways to get to know any particular outfit
[00:33:15] was to accompany its men on an ambush. Generally, they were disgrace. So this is interesting.
[00:33:20] I guarantee, and I don't, you know, I don't use that word very often. He shows up as the IG
[00:33:25] and what does he do? He starts going in the field all the time with the troops. Because he's that kind
[00:33:29] of bro. You know, he's that kind of brother that's just like, oh, I'll be in the army. We got troops.
[00:33:34] I'm going in the field. So that's what he starts doing. And as you're going out on patrol,
[00:33:38] well, this is what he finds. The fault was obvious poor leadership and more specific
[00:33:43] absentee leadership. Few of the ambush patrols, I accompanied included a senior or non-commissioned
[00:33:49] officer. The enlisted men at humped all day long and carried their load. And then at night,
[00:33:54] they were expected to stay awake and cut it again the next day. They took their sleep where and
[00:33:58] when they could get it on patrol and for what most and for the most part, the company commanders
[00:34:03] didn't know what the hell was going on or worse just didn't care. It was their fault. But the
[00:34:07] real culprits were at the higher level, battalion commanders who rode out the procedures,
[00:34:11] almost verbatim from the fort-bending operations and training handbook, passed them down to their
[00:34:16] subordinates and let it go at that. They were covered. The procedures had no relationship to the
[00:34:23] realities of combat. And you got to remember the Colonel that originally told me about this book,
[00:34:31] this guy is the same kind of vein as Hacworth. He's coming at you. And he loves being a soldier
[00:34:40] and he loves his soldiers. But he's got no love for the upper chain of command. You can, as you can see,
[00:34:47] a field standards, which apply to combat conditions are important. And those were the criteria I
[00:34:54] applied as I walked through B company's area and then he's getting into like actually being out there.
[00:34:58] A good soldier wears even the most ragged deer well. Even in the field, he is trim,
[00:35:04] neat and tight with pockets buttoned and no loose or hanging straps or webbing. He does not wear
[00:35:09] sunglasses. He keeps a clean face and clean weapon and clean ammunition. These kids didn't cut it.
[00:35:14] The reason I could only conclude was poor leadership. Leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield.
[00:35:21] Good or bad. It was strictly a matter of leadership. He's talking about going on patrol with a
[00:35:25] couple different companies. Take the contrast I found between B company and C company. It was the
[00:35:32] same battalion, same area of operations with approximately the same number of troops in the same
[00:35:35] kind of mission. Yeah, while B company was a mess, C company was struck strategic tough and ready around the
[00:35:43] clock. They were airborne man all the way. One night I went along in a pertune size patrol
[00:35:48] commanded by a young lieutenant. It was like clockwork, like beautiful Swiss clockwork. We moved quietly,
[00:35:54] paused for a silent C rap meal and drifted off further into the brush to set up shop. Nobody
[00:35:58] smoked nobody talked Charlie company in a lieutenant Webster or hunters. And as I sat tight against
[00:36:03] a palm tree that night I felt good about being out there with them. They had a purpose. Just before
[00:36:08] dawn Webster received orders. This is such a good lesson. Just before dawn Webster received orders
[00:36:15] to drift back to base. About 12 miles away. Helicopters were unavailable. He was told. So orders
[00:36:22] were to foot it back and bring along the mermaids. The thermal food containers that weighed about
[00:36:27] 30 pounds of work clumsy as hell to carry. Webster stared at me in the early morning light.
[00:36:32] It's stupid. He said, but it's an order I replied playing at straight. He looked at me steadily
[00:36:38] and then made up his mind. Yeah, he said, well fuck them. We're not carrying no goddamn cans back
[00:36:44] through the bush. He turned to his radio man. Pass the word to get rid of the garbage cans and
[00:36:49] all. We're going to take a hike so keep it light and don't leave anything for Charlie.
[00:36:53] The radio man turned to leave and Webster stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
[00:36:56] The first fucking noise somebody gets it in the mouth. He warned and then turned to me.
[00:37:02] I'll take the gig and the asked chewing. Webster had a real outfit because he was a real leader.
[00:37:08] He had a good reputation and he earned an even larger one by the time we left. The captain
[00:37:13] and B company and Webster and C company both at the same raw material. Yeah, one was running a
[00:37:19] sloppy sad ass show that couldn't cut it. The other was commanding a tough tight combat ready
[00:37:24] and combat able outfit. The difference was leadership. So there you go. That's a freaking classic
[00:37:33] case of you get told do something stupid. What's the good leader do? Now he could have had that
[00:37:39] argument. Maybe he said, hey, you really don't want me to carry this stuff. That's just a big pain in
[00:37:44] the ass and he says, you know what? There's a kernel here. Fuck it. We're not doing that. That
[00:37:48] doesn't make sense. He says this. If a legitimate study is made of that war, most Americans will
[00:38:01] be stundled learn that we killed the hell of a lot of our own people. Once again, a failure
[00:38:05] directly traceable the poor leadership. All that took was the sound of a booby trap or the
[00:38:10] sighting of movement and we were prone to just open up to fire to the jungle and brush in every
[00:38:14] direction without any idea of who might be on the right or left or behind or ahead. We did it
[00:38:20] over and over again to ourselves. Here's an example he gives. Once again, we had killed one of our own
[00:38:30] and this particular case he had caused his own death that was said. He was a young lieutenant out on
[00:38:36] his first patrol. According to the report, he had set up the ambush and then left its perimeter
[00:38:42] to establish security, which was completely asked backwards but nevertheless the way he had been
[00:38:48] trained by the US Army. When I was in Ranger School at Fort Benning, I had seen the examples
[00:38:55] set dozens of times without any criticism. Training bullshit. We had too many damn academics.
[00:39:04] We trained not only with blank ammunition but with blank attitudes as well, using instructors who
[00:39:09] had gone through the same kind of blank training men who in their wildest dreams could not relate
[00:39:14] to a real combat patrol because it never meant part of their own experience. The Army claimed
[00:39:19] the instructors were combat veterans and some no doubt were but most had merely been in combat
[00:39:25] zones. Because of that kind of training, the young lieutenant was dead. The report detailed how he had
[00:39:32] gone out from the patrol's main body to position the outpost people himself just as he had been
[00:39:38] taught and then headed back through the deep jungle and at night alone toward his main group.
[00:39:45] In the daylight moving through brush his heart at night, it's a formidable task.
[00:39:50] When his men heard movement to their rear, the report related, they called him on the radio.
[00:39:58] At least he had enough sense to take it along. So they got an ambush set up. He goes to
[00:40:03] set some security out now. He's walking back and the guys that are in the ambush here noise.
[00:40:10] So they call him up and say, hey, you know, we hear noise behind us. And what does the lieutenant say?
[00:40:16] He says, Kremum and they did. He was dropped in his tracks.
[00:40:20] Schooled, trained, ranger, airborne and he had ordered his own execution.
[00:40:27] I tried to console myself by thinking that anybody so goddamn ignorant deserved to die,
[00:40:32] but it didn't work. I knew he had been trained by guys like me, not me personally, but by senior
[00:40:39] personnel like me. It was our fault. I tried to imagine myself doing what he had done
[00:40:46] even several years earlier and I couldn't. He was worse than untrained. He was badly trained.
[00:40:52] He had no business being out there in charge on his first patrol and his battalion commander couldn't
[00:40:57] be held blameless either. It was sickening. We were the healthiest, wealthiest, supposedly best
[00:41:04] trained soldiers in the world. Our army had the finest raw material of any country. We had the
[00:41:09] equipment and the experience to do better. We fought like a bunch of amateurs. I shoved my coffee
[00:41:14] aside and looked around the talk. There were white cloths and flowers on the tables and paintings
[00:41:20] on the walls. It was ludicrous. I grabbed a chopper back to on K and on the way, constructed the
[00:41:26] rest of the night, that night's pitiful drama. The dead lieutenant was from a little town in
[00:41:32] Pennsylvania, not far from where I had grown up. A telegram would soon arrive and the middle-aged
[00:41:37] mother would collapse on the couch in the living room while the father tried to console her through
[00:41:42] his own tears. I imagine myself walking into the room and standing at the end of the couch,
[00:41:48] looking down on them and saying that I had killed their kid. The vision passed and I was grateful
[00:41:55] that he wasn't one of my men and I wouldn't have to explain it even to myself.
[00:42:07] We had much, much, too much. Whatever the reason was, the nature of war, the difference in the
[00:42:12] attitudes and the personnel, the abundance was overwhelming. The red cross, for instance, came
[00:42:17] up with 15,000 individual Christmas packages for the 10,000 men of the 173rd. He's kind of going
[00:42:24] on a rant here about just what that giant logistical and rear echelon footprint was like,
[00:42:33] Sergeant Renn, the motel, they have a motel, the motel manager told me and booth that the tab for
[00:42:39] the brigade's entertainment ran close to $200,000 a month. So there's all this stuff is going on
[00:42:47] and look, he counts for a lot of this stuff that he's investigating with the IG. There's stealing
[00:42:52] going on, there's fraud going on, there's rape going on, sexual harassment, sexual assaults,
[00:43:00] and murder, and prisoner abuse, people going awall, there's all kinds of criminal behavior happening.
[00:43:09] He goes into this one. The records of the stay counts and pizza hut were equally shocking.
[00:43:15] Tons of meat were unaccounted for along with thousands of pre-fixed pizzas and truckloads of
[00:43:19] liquor and beer. Three years later Congress would be pulling the covers off what would become known
[00:43:24] as the club scandals. It would involve generals at the very top and the very top Sergeant of the
[00:43:30] whole army, Sergeant Major Woolrich, whom General Westmoreland himself had handpicked as the
[00:43:36] US Army's first top kick, even then the army would be trying to sweep it under the rug.
[00:43:43] It was in our brigade that the investigation which led to the scandal started our investigation
[00:43:47] launched at General Allen's request. The lines were being drawn and the IG shop was no longer
[00:43:54] sluffed off in dinner conversations. It'd become a power and I'd become for some of my comrades and
[00:44:00] arms the enemy. Fast forward a little bit. He's looking, he's, remember, he went there as the
[00:44:14] IG but he's supposed to get a battalion and become a battalion commander eventually. It would be
[00:44:19] the third battalion and I would get it in April. He said this would necessitate an extension of
[00:44:23] my tour so I could get in my six months minimum of command time. But it would be worth the
[00:44:29] extension he said. The present commander of the third battalion would have six months in by April,
[00:44:33] which was another anomaly of the Vietnam War. It mattered not that a commander was doing a great
[00:44:38] job or a crappy job. Six months was the magic number. Officer's got their tickets punched in
[00:44:44] six months and then got the hell out to some other assignment to work on another credit or get
[00:44:49] their another coupon certified. General West Morland had said it a long time before when I was
[00:44:54] a major that the Russians were very envious of the way our officer corps was getting tremendous
[00:44:59] combat experience in Vietnam and even then I knew it was bullshit. It takes a commander a couple
[00:45:06] months to become acclimated to his responsibility, a couple more to get going and then he's gone. It was
[00:45:10] crazy. Besides we were losing in Vietnam. A fact which the US Army officer corps seemed not to want
[00:45:17] to recognize. It would have been better to have fought the whole goddamn war with a hundred honest
[00:45:22] to God commanders than a thousand of the half-ass combat leader types we were producing.
[00:45:27] Whatever gave the notion we could build a better mouse trap in six months. It was a pipe dream
[00:45:33] and what was worse was that the leaders quote the quote leaders we were grinding out
[00:45:39] would be not an asset but a detriment in a big war should one come. Then they would be considered
[00:45:47] experts and the delusion would cost us plenty. So you go there, you're a Italian commander for six
[00:45:56] months, get your box checked and then you're out. And by the way now all of a sudden you're a
[00:46:02] Italian commander. So that means what you say is gold. Another thing he's got to deal with.
[00:46:13] Fracking. Fracking the deliberate attack on a non-com or an officer by an enlisted man or
[00:46:21] men was not unknown in the 173. One sergeant over in the signal section had made the mistake of
[00:46:27] raising hell with a trooper about the cleanliness of his area. The man wired to claim or mine
[00:46:32] outside the sergeants room aimed it right through the wall of the switch at the switchboard
[00:46:37] went to a phone and called his victim. The sergeant lost both legs. There was a fracking in second
[00:46:45] battalion too with seven wounded. They tried to get Nicholson with explosives and on another
[00:46:51] occasion they tried to blow up his tactile operation center. One of the men in second battalion
[00:46:56] had reportedly blown himself the bits with a claim or mine but my investigation failed to corroborate
[00:47:01] this. It had been in his hands. So here's a guy with a claim or mine in his hands. That was
[00:47:07] certain but there were two men in nearby bunker handering the candling the controls of the mine
[00:47:12] went off. The victim had left the bunker to retrieve the mine at the request of the other two
[00:47:17] and somehow they said the circuit had been completed. I wasn't a real detective but even though
[00:47:24] two company commander Swarr it was accidental I did sign my report with a recommendation that the
[00:47:31] criminal investigation division checked into it they never did.
[00:47:37] Fourth battalion had a genuine insurrection. Herb Matsuo, the executive the battalion executive officer told
[00:47:44] me an old Colonel living in an air condition trailer to become sort of a father figure for the
[00:47:49] riff raff in the battalion. No kidding, Tony, Herb said he's actually pulled all the freaks in
[00:47:55] around him and made a personal bodyguard outfit with weapons and all and the old geezers
[00:48:00] dumb enough to believe they're responding to him. The Colonel called his men the Mafioso.
[00:48:06] They're going to cause serious trouble, Tony. They're the worst kind of people we have over here.
[00:48:11] They're killers and I'm not joking. You better get worded general island before it's too late. I think
[00:48:20] I'm maybe kind of confused. So, fragging is a term where it's what it means is you got an officer
[00:48:30] or you've got a senior enlisted person that you don't like and you kill him.
[00:48:34] That's a thing. There you go. There's two examples. They put it in movies in Platoon. You've
[00:48:44] seen Platoon, right? No. What? I don't hear anything. Are you serious? I am serious. I have never
[00:48:50] seen Platoon. Well, go assignment. Go watch Platoon. Yeah, okay. So, okay, okay, it's a movies.
[00:48:59] Uh, yeah, there's a lot of things in movies, but it's seen. That seems really weird. Obviously,
[00:49:05] that doesn't happen. Nowties. Well, you'd certainly hope not. Yeah, I mean, I've, I've never heard
[00:49:11] of a crazy case of fragging now, but yes, in Vietnam, it absolutely. Like, there's, there you go.
[00:49:16] There's cases up right there. So, so, imagine this. You are a young 21-year-old, 19-year-old,
[00:49:26] 18-year-old person. You don't believe in this war. You don't like it. You don't want to die.
[00:49:32] And in comes, you know, Lieutenant Rambo, that's like, we're going to go out. We're going to take
[00:49:38] the fight to the enemy. And you think you can get killed. Yeah. And he's going to charge you with
[00:49:43] being a coward or whatever. Yeah. You're killing people. That's what's happening over there. So,
[00:49:49] you're going out on a combat operation. You get into a firefight. Oh, Lieutenant,
[00:49:54] young Lieutenant happens to get shot. Yeah. I guess I'm training day technically that's what he did
[00:50:00] or was trying to do where it's like, yeah, you know, we're going to see if this guy's going to
[00:50:04] play ball with us in our, in our group. He doesn't. And then he sets him up to get killed. Yeah,
[00:50:11] that's a, well, yeah, that's a fragging. It tries to do it anyway. Yeah, it's a real thing.
[00:50:16] It's a real thing. There's another, he's doing an investigation of a company that got
[00:50:26] creamed. He said, so this company like took massive casualties and he's talking through it.
[00:50:33] What had happened with, uh, he's about to talk through with General Allen. It had been marijuana.
[00:50:41] I took it back to Allen and he didn't like it one bit. The company had been creamed and there was an
[00:50:46] single dead enemy. I suggested that we write it up as a lesson. The learned one that even a
[00:50:51] knit wit trooper could understand no one individual had been at fault. I reasoned it had been marijuana.
[00:50:57] And as bad as that was, it would serve as a valuable purpose. It would serve a valuable purpose as a
[00:51:01] combat lesson for the living. Marijuana and guns don't miss mix. The general was staring at me when I
[00:51:09] finished. You must be mad. I said, sir, do you realize what you're asking he said, walking over to his
[00:51:15] window for another glance at those goddamn flowers? He's got flowers like panel planted outside of his
[00:51:20] window. Sir, can you imagine what you've just suggested? Those were American kids. Two captains
[00:51:26] in a hell of a lot of American kids are dead. He threw up his hands and discussed and shot sat down
[00:51:31] at his desk and you want me to tell higher headquarters and their families that they were on dope.
[00:51:36] Not dope sir, marijuana. And we don't have to say that everyone was on it. Just point out that
[00:51:41] the reason they had had their asses creamed. He stood up again. I'll have to think about it.
[00:51:49] For the time being, just keep it to yourself. Understand? I stood up. I understand sir. He sat back
[00:51:53] down again and I will consider it. Later I read about A company's fate in the stars and stripes
[00:52:00] and in our own brigade newspaper, the sky's soldier. The two accounts were nearly identical. The company
[00:52:06] had put up one hell of a fight but it had been overrun by a numerically superior force at a substantial
[00:52:12] cost to the enemy. It was one more glorious chapter in the glorious history of the 173rd
[00:52:18] Eric born brigade. The official accounts of that night on the hill were a goddamn discredited to
[00:52:23] every mother's son who fought worth a lick and Vietnam. The general no doubt believed it saved some
[00:52:28] face. I never mentioned it again. So you know you get like this is Matt Mass coverups right?
[00:52:41] And no lessons learned by the way. So that lesson learned doesn't get passed on anybody.
[00:52:48] The story of A company's heroism and gallantry was published about the same day. The lieutenant
[00:52:53] Colonel Joseph Ross Franklin joined the brigade as a replacement as the deputy commander. Franklin
[00:52:59] had graduated from West Point 1949. One of the distinguished service cross in Korea. His head was
[00:53:05] completely hairless. He shaved it. He looked like a badass combat commander. He was impressive. No doubt
[00:53:13] and his teeth sparkled. They say he's a breath of fresh air. Abbott remarked. So here comes this
[00:53:19] guy Franklin and I think he's the most decorated officer from his class at West Point. This guy
[00:53:30] Franklin and that's from Korea. And so you think you know if you were decorated highly decorated
[00:53:40] veteran from Korea and I was a decorated highly decorated veteran from Korea there's a good chance
[00:53:44] that you and I could meet and be like hey bro right on right like we could just be you know have this
[00:53:49] kind of unified past right sure what else could happen. You'll a little bit threaten some competition
[00:53:56] you should have some ego scenarios right we could have that competition between you and me and I
[00:54:00] think I'm a little bit braver than you my my medals are a little bit made of whatever yeah.
[00:54:06] Well unfortunately no it's it didn't and it gonna be growing out.
[00:54:11] Yeah.
[00:54:16] Here we go. How about a briefing he finally suggested and don't pull any punches Herbert.
[00:54:23] When I finished he had one question where that bad huh? Where worse sir but you'll see it for yourself
[00:54:29] and it's not because the caliber of the troops either. We have the finest top sergeants I have
[00:54:34] ever known in the army and we have the healthiest toughest privates you can find anywhere.
[00:54:38] But the worst general he said not really I said Allen is okay. Then leadership sir I said
[00:54:47] and then he not then as he nodded I related every last air ride scene in the brigade.
[00:54:51] When I finished I attributed them all directly to lack of leadership. How do you mean that Herbert
[00:54:57] Franklin asked? It was precisely what I wanted him to ask. The troops are ragged asked because they
[00:55:04] have no one to emulate that they respect. Men are dying because leaders don't care enough to lead.
[00:55:09] It is an Allen in particular although he's included but the real problem is that a much lower level
[00:55:14] at the level of the battalions and the companies. If I followed regulations I'd be recommending
[00:55:19] courts Marshall for every last battalion commander I've seen in this brigade and I've seen them all.
[00:55:23] They write policy books have their men initial them and then try and correct any value
[00:55:27] violations they after they occur. Nobody leads by example. They command from 1500 feet up in a chopper
[00:55:34] then and they wear spit-shined boots like they're on parade while their men hump through the bush
[00:55:40] with their asses half out of their trousers. Everybody plans big but nobody sees two of
[00:55:46] it but that their plans are carried out. Our lieutenant colonels fight their battalions on paper
[00:55:50] as if they were chest pieces on a board. That's Herbert. The office was definitely quiet until he spoke.
[00:56:01] What do you recommend Herbert? Well since you asked kick a couple battalion commanders in the
[00:56:07] ass get them out of their birds and onto the ground make them spend a few nights out with their
[00:56:11] units and don't permit them the right to transfer the men they consider bad news force them to
[00:56:16] get off their asses and lead and then we'll have a brigade. That's exactly why I'm here Herbert.
[00:56:22] He said sir to lead. He said that's why the brigade is getting a new general to lead. General
[00:56:27] Pierce's damn sick of Allen and his entire hajpodge. He walked to the door.
[00:56:33] Things are about to change Herbert for the better. He stepped out into the darkness. I slipped the
[00:56:38] files back in the cabinet and sat down for a moment to think about it. Maybe he was going to make
[00:56:42] a difference I'm used. Maybe as Abbott had told me frankly it would be a breath of fresh air.
[00:56:48] So off to good start. We did a little bit of growing out. Yeah.
[00:56:57] Then we have Brigadier General. John W. Barnes took over the 173rd thus making a complete change
[00:57:03] command. That as Abbott said was supposed to be it bring a breath of fresh air to that part of
[00:57:09] you. So then things start to go sideways. There's a little incident that goes down the next day.
[00:57:20] I was summoned to LZ English by Franklin the new deputy commander of the brigade.
[00:57:26] You're a no good disloyal son of a bitch he said for openers. What are you talking about? I asked
[00:57:32] you insulted one of my battalion commanders. When a year battalion commanders are repeated.
[00:57:37] Yes, God damn it. Wanna mind? No sense in trying to lie out of it either because your ass is
[00:57:41] going to swing. I was dumbfounded until he finally explained that he had heard about the call from
[00:57:46] Northern to General Allen and Northern to said you suggested that call Franklin said you did it without
[00:57:51] permission. What do you think I should have done? I asked to come to me. That's what for what
[00:57:56] reason? Because I'm the commander. That's why he said and all along I thought General Barnes was the
[00:58:01] new top man in the brigade. My eyes were wide but I tried to keep the emotion out of my voice.
[00:58:05] I knew damn well I was treading on very thin ice. You sir are not my commander. The general is.
[00:58:12] You can tell it's just like a bad move. He exploded and the breath of fresh air was gone forever.
[00:58:20] I was he said again a no good son of a bitch and a disloyal liar. I had continued true. I had
[00:58:27] he continued trying to sink angel and others in the brigade for my personal gain as the IG.
[00:58:32] General Barnes stepped out of his trailer and Franklin hailed him. General do you know
[00:58:36] what this Colonel of yours did he said? Shubbing his finger into my chest. The illegally warned
[00:58:42] General Allen of an investigation we had talked about. So things are going sideways.
[00:58:49] Yeah and that it was sort of the re I didn't even cover the thing that he did because it was
[00:59:04] like it was almost nothing. I called the Ednor Thinkton who had been Allen's aid. It was now in his
[00:59:11] new job and asked him if he had heard about the investigation. Is it General and Trouble? No that's
[00:59:16] what he did. He like basically gave a heads up and but it was like a little bit outside the chain
[00:59:22] of command so General or sorry Colonel Franklin freaks out. Fast forward a little bit.
[00:59:32] He is in Hawaii with on leave with his wife Mary Grace. Mary Grace finally asked him about
[00:59:41] Vietnam. A royal screw up I said your anti war Tony Herbert. No that's not what I mean. I mean I'm
[00:59:49] just disgusted by what I've seen happening to the army I said she looked puzzled. I had already told
[00:59:53] her about getting batying command and though she knew it meant that I would be more vulnerable
[00:59:59] to injure your death than I was and as an IG she took it as I had as she'd always taken my career.
[01:00:05] She was proud she said but now she looked bewildered as I talked about some of the things I had
[01:00:10] seen. This war is not only killing our people it's ruining our army the whole damn show is run
[01:00:16] without leaders and we're losing really losing. We talked the rest of the afternoon and finally she asked
[01:00:22] about what would happen when my Vietnam tour was finished. Wait till you hear this I said grinning
[01:00:27] you're gonna quit she said throwing some sand my way right Colonel Herbert wrong Mrs. Herbert.
[01:00:33] I've got orders for the command and command and General Staff College at 11 worth. All Tony that's great
[01:00:38] and after that I'm gonna try and finish my doctorate maybe then I can really contribute something to the army.
[01:00:49] Fast forward a little bit I kissed Mary Grayson lay back in bed staring out at the ocean
[01:00:52] through the glass doors at the end of our room. I thought about them all night and about the years
[01:00:57] that had passed and the things that had happened to all of us. Now is 1968 and I was 38 years old I
[01:01:04] had a wife and daughter and I had killed one hell of a lot of people and watched a lot more
[01:01:09] suffer and cry and die and now Maul is gone and Pa and sister Irene.
[01:01:17] You are what you are you dumbass Lithuanian. I thought that night is the moon illuminated the far
[01:01:22] end of the room you are what you are and what you always wanted to be a soldier.
[01:01:37] Get back to Vietnam and I'm just going through so much of this book what I'm just skipping so much
[01:01:48] there's so much detail in here about all these different things that he's dealing with. These relationships
[01:01:53] that he has with Colonel Franklin and General Barnes and how these things are just going sideways and
[01:02:02] he gets this one point take a look take a look at this and please read it all before your
[01:02:06] comment. Ray said handing me a file folder the investigation had been handled by major
[01:02:12] Henry Boyer the executive officer of second battalion. I flipped the cover sheet and turned to the
[01:02:17] first page of three inch by five inch color photographs dared to me. It was a picture of a
[01:02:21] Vietnamese male lying on his back and what appeared to be a shell creator. His face had been blown away
[01:02:28] in guilt beneath the picture was engraved piece on earth from the peacemakers.
[01:02:33] Sea company 173rd airborne brigade or something that affect. I glanced at Ray.
[01:02:37] Sea company of second battalion he he he he company of second battalion he said. I turned the
[01:02:42] page and read it through well he said I put it down on his desk it's a cover up your damn right it's a
[01:02:48] cover up and little old Paul here is not going to be caught in the middle. You know what Franklin
[01:02:53] wants he asked without waiting for me to answer Franklin wants it swept under the rug.
[01:02:58] They're exactly 50 cards out like that and he wants them gathered and covered.
[01:03:03] And what if that's not possible? Well then I guess we just have to put the burden on Christ.
[01:03:07] He said referring to Captain Christ the company officer of sea company. So like it's just big
[01:03:15] cover up is going on. Make this go away no one everyone's worried about their career.
[01:03:28] All right through through all this chaos
[01:03:34] and he's he's been the IG at the 173rd and you don't think he's going to get a battalion
[01:03:43] because he's kind of created these bad relationships but he ends up getting tasks getting
[01:03:49] awarded getting task getting charged with taking over second battalion.
[01:03:56] So he's going to be working for the guy that has hated him as the IG.
[01:03:59] Mm-hmm. As I walked back to my sack that night I decided to use the next 24 hours prep time.
[01:04:06] I wanted to work out the second battalion in my mind. I laid down and began and in the
[01:04:10] states you might be able to go in and take your time with changes but not in Vietnam.
[01:04:13] In the states you could look around for a bit and maybe take a couple of weeks before
[01:04:16] actually making a change but in Vietnam it was a different story. Take your time in Vietnam
[01:04:21] and men died or lost legs or arms or eyes. So I had already been looking and thanks to my
[01:04:27] opportunities as an IG and and coachers help I knew about as much as anybody could know about
[01:04:34] the second battalion and it all blew down to one primary conclusion. Like the entire brigade
[01:04:39] the second battalion was fat in every area except combat. The solution was to trim.
[01:04:47] He goes on about how he's going to get rid of people or move people into more combat rules
[01:04:53] because there's all these people that are not doing combat. Fast forward a little bit. I didn't
[01:05:00] like the way Nicholson had handled the men who were on the way home. Frequently they would come
[01:05:06] back to the rear as much as 30 days before they were scheduled to depart. That was a bunch of crap.
[01:05:12] I had learned my lesson in Korea. Rotation had been established and tigers became plussies.
[01:05:17] So what are you talking about there and we cover that in the lost podcast?
[01:05:23] In World War II when you went on deployment for the war you went on deployment for the war.
[01:05:28] You were going to get to go home when the war was over. In Korea is when they started hey you're
[01:05:32] going to deploy for six little a year. You're going to deploy for a year and then you get to go home.
[01:05:37] Well what does that do? Well according to him it turns tigers into plussies.
[01:05:41] They had hung back and played it safe until they until we wise up and came up with a new policy.
[01:05:49] He who fought up front went home up front. I didn't have the authority to establish that policy
[01:05:55] in Vietnam but I did have the authority to decide who came back to the rear and win.
[01:06:00] I could make sure that a man kept his ass in the grass until seven days before his departure
[01:06:04] day and I was determined that the battalion would start rewarding achievement rather than failure.
[01:06:13] Under Nicholson the last battalion commander. If a guy wrapped a sergeant in the mouth or if he
[01:06:18] refused to fight he came back to the rear sat on his ass waiting drinking, seeing shows,
[01:06:24] smoking pot and screwing everything that wago downtown until he was court-martialed or given an
[01:06:30] article 15 at which point he would pay a small fine for his vacation of several weeks or months.
[01:06:36] Then he went back to his unit and did it again. But not with me. Every mother's son was going to
[01:06:41] hump it and carry his share of the load just like the few already out there.
[01:06:48] There were others so that's that's the secondary consequences that you got to think about or
[01:06:53] unintended consequences that you got to think about. Hey if echo Charles punches his platoon sergeant
[01:06:59] what we're going to send him back to the rear and what's he going to do through. Get drunk.
[01:07:04] You know smoke pot. Get a vacation. Have to pay a small amount of money and you come back right
[01:07:09] out and do it again because you don't want to fight you. We're actually giving you what you want.
[01:07:13] Yes kind of like the kid, the teenager with the with the video he has like he gets punished and sent
[01:07:20] to his room but then in his room is like video games and magazines and all this stuff is phone
[01:07:25] internet, yeah all this stuff. So he'll go you know when things get tough in real life you know go
[01:07:32] mo the lawn out on a whatever he'll act up get sent to his room. Yeah. Yeah. That's why the punishment,
[01:07:39] the modern day punishment with kids with teenagers is phone. Yeah. Take away your phone. Yeah.
[01:07:46] It's brutal. My kids like if I say that to my kids they're like, what?
[01:07:50] Right. Squarsimal way quick. You're seeing Ozark. I have not seen it. Okay. So it's like anyway
[01:07:57] I don't go too deep into it but basically they're they're put over simplifying it. They're running
[01:08:02] from these the drug cartels. So they're trying to leave. They're trying to disappear. And so it's like
[01:08:11] two kids. One is 12 one is like I don't know 16 17. Like girl and then the two parents. So
[01:08:18] the parents are like, hey we gotta go. We're changing our identities and all this stuff. So here
[01:08:22] give me your phone. The girl just starts flipping out. And it's kind of one of those things where,
[01:08:27] yeah man like some, especially kids while it depends on who you are but a lot of times kids are
[01:08:32] so attached to that phone. Oh yeah. Like it's such a big deal. It's the social thing like you know when
[01:08:37] I was a kid you know you would get grounded. Right. What you meant you couldn't see your friends.
[01:08:44] Yeah. You couldn't see your girlfriend. You couldn't see your bros like you were grounded.
[01:08:50] Well nowadays you like you said you can send the room but you're still gonna hang out with your friends
[01:08:54] because you're gonna be on snap. Chaps. Right. That's what's gonna be happening. Yeah. So
[01:09:00] sending them to a room doesn't really it's not really grounding them. The way you've ground them is
[01:09:03] you gotta get that device. Get that phone. There's so many kids that are mad at me right now.
[01:09:08] I'll put that this one. Hey what's article 15? It's if I'm your commander and you do something wrong.
[01:09:20] Then you can be punished under the uniform code of military justice.
[01:09:27] The UCMJ article 15. Article 15 means that I can dock your pay. I can reduce your rank like I can apply
[01:09:37] punishment to you. Now you have to opt. You can you can say you can accept
[01:09:45] you can accept the UCMJ or you can say I want a court martial in which case you're gonna get
[01:09:50] a lawyer. You're gonna get a jury and all that kind of stuff. So article 15 is going to be lesser.
[01:09:55] It's a little bit of a gamble sometimes depending on what you did and because you could say
[01:10:04] if I'm your boss and you did something wrong, people might be telling you just do just take
[01:10:09] just take article 15 and you know, Joc was pretty lenient. You know he's pretty or people might be like
[01:10:13] you don't want to do UCMJ. You don't want to go article 15 with Joc or he crazy.
[01:10:18] He's gonna he's gonna fill my bucket. So it's kind of like what like a
[01:10:21] I guess not like a plea bargain then because you know not like a plea bargain. It's just
[01:10:27] accepting your fate with what your boss is gonna your boss has the authority article 15
[01:10:34] UCMJ to say okay echo Charles he stole a piece of gear from the platoon. We're kicking them out
[01:10:41] of the platoon. Well he's gonna go to UCMJ. So you go to you go to me on your boss and I say okay
[01:10:48] you stole gear. We're taking your try and you have to pay back the money. I'm bossing you down in
[01:10:53] rank and you're gonna go to the break for 30 days. There you go. Now you could let's say you didn't you
[01:10:59] thought you didn't steal it and you you want to make a case you could say I request court Marshall
[01:11:04] in which case and how are we gonna court Marshall now you get a lawyer that says well he's he was just
[01:11:08] borrowing that gear right and everyone knows that that you're lying. So that's the kind of similarity
[01:11:14] to going to trial. You know all guys like no I'll take this. So in that case it is. Except for
[01:11:21] you don't necessarily know what the bargain is. Right so it's not like a plea bargain. It's
[01:11:25] just like a blind. Just a little bit of blind. It's a little bit of blind but it's sort of is
[01:11:32] a little bit of like hey look I know I kind of did this I'm throwing myself at the mercy of the court.
[01:11:37] Hey boss I screwed up I'm sorry hit me yeah like pleading guilty essentially you know my
[01:11:45] inner kind of way because the you know that you're kind of yep it's up to the judge I was like okay
[01:11:49] you're putting it in your phone your kind of that kind of stuff out the mercy the court.
[01:11:53] That's the 15. What is forgive me by the way I'm demediating what didn't you and I've heard this
[01:11:59] here you guys say this all the time taking your tried and what does that mean you're not in
[01:12:02] maybe see anymore. Yeah just straight up you can't get it back. You can't go through the whole deal.
[01:12:06] Yep. Yep. That's kind of everything right? Not kind of. That's everything but you're still in the
[01:12:14] name you though. You can still be in the name you know but that's not your jam if you're a seal typically.
[01:12:18] Yeah it's not your jam I remember there was a guy that stole a pair of sunglasses from
[01:12:26] like another guy. Yep. They had his they had a capins mask the next day for a little
[01:12:36] article 15 took his bird he was gone like that how's it always pretty new guy because if you
[01:12:43] are a thief in the team's yeah it's brutal you you are gonna get you are gonna get crushed like you
[01:12:50] will get there's there's you can leave anything out in the seal teams you can leave a freaking
[01:12:55] diamond uh uh in crusted knife yeah and no one will touch it in the team. You don't know we don't
[01:13:03] steal anything in the team's. Yeah and that makes sense I mean especially like such when you're like a
[01:13:09] cohesive or supposed to be cohesive team you know. Oh yeah you're gonna steal something yeah that's
[01:13:15] like nuts. He's still still still he sunglasses too I mean day. Oh I know especially when you
[01:13:21] get issued sunglasses hey supply guy I need new sunglasses and I don't even know what all the
[01:13:26] circumstances were behind it because let's face it we all have Oakley's back. Yeah
[01:13:31] can you do we're all wearing the same sunglasses so I don't know if I do had some engraving on there
[01:13:36] or scratch his name into it whatever but man this guy was gone and that makes even less sense when
[01:13:41] you think about it because it's not like you're not gonna wear him when you're gonna do just
[01:13:44] steal him and put him in your house under your pillow or something like this you're gonna be wearing
[01:13:48] them around. Who knows maybe there was other things that I didn't know about I was a new guy I didn't
[01:13:52] know anything there's like hey don't steal shit I'm like cool god it's not like we're not stealing
[01:13:59] in the zoo things if freaking pissed me off on time when I went to my first ship board deployment
[01:14:04] and a guy stole I had my gear out and a guy stole a knife. They wasn't from my
[01:14:12] petune but it's just somebody on the ship maybe it was a marine maybe it was a navy guy I don't know
[01:14:16] oh you didn't find them no we never found them but same thing like what's this guy gonna do he's
[01:14:20] gonna hide that knife and then take it home and put it under his pillow like he's not gonna be
[01:14:26] able to use it because we'll see him and then we'll throw him off the ship. Yeah man yeah and that makes
[01:14:33] it even here about a guy stealing from someone else on the team it's like bro yeah you're
[01:14:38] known to mess around that guy anymore the probably had a guy's name I forget his name
[01:14:42] he stole a video game systems like a super Nintendo or something like that from one of the
[01:14:47] guys in the dorms on the football team both of them and they were like it was weird because yeah my
[01:14:53] friend the name's Dave he's the one who got it stolen from he was like looking around for
[01:14:59] he's like you know you're just confused it's not like something kind of steal your whole video
[01:15:03] okay I do your dorm room and he lives in the same dorm too so it's like it's like what do you
[01:15:07] set it up for doors down that's what I'm saying so it was just gone so he was confused and then
[01:15:12] after what's like no someone stole this you know so they you know they went through the thing and
[01:15:17] they were like dusting for prints which was like you know that doesn't matter because everyone
[01:15:20] comes in and out of the dorm so it just doesn't didn't even matter but I think Davey was suspicious
[01:15:25] of this guy I don't know if he became suspicious or he was already suspicious so he was so
[01:15:30] he was so he was so he went to his room and just was like you know what I'm gonna get to the
[01:15:37] bottom of this thing and he was like asking him he was like what are you talking about on that
[01:15:41] or whatever became his big thing and then he looked and in the dorms there's these beds right
[01:15:46] the beds are like that and you can like take there's like a drawer under the bed and all this stuff
[01:15:50] right you know everything got a fit uh got a fit in the door so he pulled out the drawer of the bed
[01:15:58] and like took you know you can take out the drawer so he unhooked it and like took it out and
[01:16:03] blown there it was Davey did that Davey did that too yeah the guys it was a call out essentially but
[01:16:09] you know when you call somebody out you better get the stuff because you know look dumb you
[01:16:13] must have been super suspect then yeah he was like because that's weird too imagine accusing someone
[01:16:19] right yeah but also you can kind of tell oh yeah I am looking at someone you can tell yeah and consider
[01:16:27] it's really not all the freaking lies yeah and usually but and consider even I mean I'm sure
[01:16:33] it's like this in the military too where you kind of consider who could or had the opportunity or
[01:16:39] whatever and if they did what would they have done it's like oh they could keep it in front of
[01:16:43] you if they can practice the other day and I come all of them on my shit's gone exactly right yeah
[01:16:48] so I think there's that kind of going on as well and then we had some circumstantial evidence
[01:16:53] then he read his face and probably so they arrest them straight up everyone was like oh my
[01:16:58] I can't believe this even happened like why would you do that it just wasn't computing for a lot of us
[01:17:04] and boom they arrested me using jail so this guy I remember his name I don't want to call him
[01:17:08] out to me but he uh so he calls the coach like you know you know when you're in college let's face it
[01:17:14] like you get into some sort of thing you say hey coach I'm in this thing like what can we do to
[01:17:19] sort of you know I hope to work it out so he calls the coach and he's like hey this is what
[01:17:25] happened I mean jail I think you need to get bail out because he didn't live in Hawaii he was from the
[01:17:29] from the mainland so it's like you know it's hard because anyway he calls the coach and the coach
[01:17:35] you know he's disturbing those rod in there okay that's what I like to do I gotta say
[01:17:41] that's what I like to do yeah don't like thieves no don't be stealing don't steal
[01:17:48] otherwise you're gonna get UCMJ article 15 alright
[01:17:52] um going back to the book here there were other things running through my mind that night
[01:17:58] tactics for instance the infantry maximum was just a slogan and I wanted it to be in practice
[01:18:05] find them fix them fight them and finish them but it simply wasn't being used I wanted to change
[01:18:12] that find them use reconnaissance and intelligence the reconnaissance platoon is being used as a special
[01:18:17] ambush unit rather than for reconnaissance the battalion had to have eyes and ears it's area of
[01:18:22] operations was bordered on the east by the south china scene and on the what south china c
[01:18:27] and on the west by string of mountains running north and south from those ridges a trooper with
[01:18:31] binoculars could see in most cases all the way to the sea but it wasn't being used fix them fire
[01:18:38] and maneuver one pins them down with fire while the other runs up around the rocks and comes in
[01:18:44] from the flanker from the behind fire maneuver have always been the key to infantry success
[01:18:54] but in Vietnam we were just calling in artillery and backing off the way the next day we would
[01:19:00] go and pick up the pieces in generally there weren't any except for the women and kids who hadn't
[01:19:04] had the sense to make it out of the area fight them close with and destroy the enemy the military
[01:19:08] enemy killed them or capture them but and emphasize prisoners because they give information
[01:19:13] that leads to more prisoners dead men are just dead men capture them if possible but if not
[01:19:19] finish them off for good i lay there in my sack that night trying to put it all together in my mind
[01:19:24] where i had been and what i had done and how i got to where i was at that very moment in time
[01:19:29] and space i was alive i decided because of two things sheer luck and not forgetting i attributed
[01:19:36] to nothing else but i knew that the presence of mine had a great deal to do with one's fortunes
[01:19:42] i also knew there were some things beyond anybody's control they just happened regardless of
[01:19:47] planning or preparation or skill or courage or cowardice i went to sleep thinking about all that
[01:19:52] the next day i poured over my batalion plans again and when i hit the sack the next night
[01:19:57] i knew i was ready as i'd ever been i slept well so i'm gonna jump through some of this
[01:20:07] stuff right now this is where he starts he takes over the batalion he starts squaring things away he starts
[01:20:12] going on operations he's still having it's not an overnight process not like the batalion oh there's
[01:20:19] new commander like we're good to go now everything's perfect it's not like that um and as he's
[01:20:25] starting to dig into the he's going on some ops he's starting to dig into trying to find out how to get the
[01:20:30] he get the platoon's moving in the right direction um he's got he sits down to talk to one of one of
[01:20:39] these latinits he's talking to the sleutannet and the lieutenant kind of he this lieutenant doesn't want
[01:20:44] to go in the field doesn't want to go in the field and he's trying to figure out why and the
[01:20:49] lieutenant says you know not with this particular leader and he says why not and he's kind of
[01:20:55] doesn't want to say anything he's finally says tell me and he and then he says he opened up he had been a
[01:21:00] platoon leader and his group had police up a detainee from a village that had reported the details to
[01:21:05] a CEO over the company net the platoon had began to tie up the the detainee for extraction
[01:21:11] when the co called back the lieutenant told me the co said what they had out there was a kia
[01:21:18] a dead dink a body count of one to which the lieutenant replied that he did not have a dead person but a
[01:21:24] detainee and reasonably good health so he says no what we have is a dead dink killed trying to get
[01:21:32] away the lieutenant continued so what did you say I asked well I told him the guy might be a civilian
[01:21:39] and what did he say he said that wasn't hardly possible because once he's dead he's a dink
[01:21:46] which in fact was about the only way it was played in Vietnam regardless of what a person might have
[01:21:51] been before he was killed afterwards he was a dink very very damn few people ever reported
[01:21:58] killing a civilian regardless of how unavoidable the death might have been and very damn few dead
[01:22:03] civilians failed to be included in body counts it was time to stop the lieutenant though before
[01:22:09] his narrative went beyond the point of no return I held up my hand hold you do you understand
[01:22:15] did that make sense because I know I jumped in the story so basically this young lieutenant is there
[01:22:19] they have a detainee that they've captured and he calls his company commander and says hey company commander
[01:22:25] I got a I got a captured individual I got a detainee you know what do you want me to do
[01:22:30] and the the commanding officer calls back and says you don't have a detainee you have a killed an action
[01:22:37] and you know that the the term dink obviously this is a slur and but it it doesn't just mean it means
[01:22:44] enemy that's what they're saying if you kill someone they're enemy with so he's he implying that you
[01:22:51] should he should kill him yep yeah and he's about that's what he's he's about to get to that part
[01:22:56] and and Colonel Herbert says hold on and he he says hold it I cautioned him sir look before you get too
[01:23:03] far there are some other questions but first you have to realize that if you say what I think you may be
[01:23:07] going to say I'm gonna have to report it therefore it's only fair in fact by the regulation in
[01:23:13] fact it's required by regulations and the UCMJ that I make you aware of your rights do you understand
[01:23:19] yes sir well then let me ask you this do you understand your rights under article 31 yes sir I do well
[01:23:25] let me go over them again for you anyways you don't have to say anything anything that you say can be
[01:23:31] used in court you can stop right now or or you can continue or you can have a military council right
[01:23:36] here while you do talk if you wish and that's an that's it in a nutshell now do you want to go on
[01:23:42] since I've gone this far for Christ's sake lieutenant at least think before you answer my next question okay
[01:23:49] okay was the execution in fact carried out yes sir it was now lieutenant here comes the big one
[01:23:57] and let me stay it again that you neither have to answer nor you expected to answer just because I'm your commander
[01:24:03] if it's going to incriminate you I want you to understand that part for sure do you yes sir I do
[01:24:09] all right then who actually did the killing he started to answer and then stop the abruptly
[01:24:16] abruptly sir I prefer not to answer that one right now if it's okay with you that's your
[01:24:20] prerogative you keep this to yourself until I get back to you do you want to put it in writing
[01:24:25] I think that I think I'd better do that good he said I said handing him a pad bring it back
[01:24:31] when you finished and forget about going out and see company right now it can wait so obviously bad situation
[01:24:49] he starts to run it up the chain a command who's that include Franklin what does Franklin say
[01:24:55] what the hell kind of commander are you he asked it's none of your business what occurred before
[01:24:59] you assumed command I'll back it up with an investigation I said there'll be no investigation
[01:25:08] says Franklin it's required sir I got damn it Herbert I'll handle it I said I'll handle it and I will
[01:25:15] if anything is done it will be done with the general's approval and it will be done by me can you
[01:25:20] understand that much I understand sir do you want to statement from major boyer I want nothing
[01:25:26] until I'm ready which means I don't want anyone discussing it either
[01:25:33] that
[01:25:43] so while he's dealing with all this and while he's continuing to create friction and again there's
[01:25:49] so much of this and there's so much in this book so many good lessons here's here's a lesson
[01:25:55] he's talking about planning and how he planned because he's still leading troops he's still
[01:25:59] they're still doing all kinds of operations he says this to his troops I want you all to come
[01:26:05] up with the plans and recommendations I told them and I meant it hell I didn't profess to be an
[01:26:11] expert in anything and by the way if you're a leader just write this whole thing down I didn't
[01:26:16] profess to be an expert in anything I was the dumb son of a fine coal miner and I could use
[01:26:22] all the help I could get if anybody came up with a brainstorm I damn sure wanted to hear about it
[01:26:29] and that includes suggestions for a commander raid on Hanauoi from Doctali I concluded
[01:26:35] I really wanted to listen to them because if a man makes a contribution to a plan he has a material
[01:26:42] interest in making it succeed so the trick is to forget about taking credit for ideas and to persuade
[01:26:49] others that they are their own take notes I talk about that very thing all the time
[01:27:04] he also says I thought out everything and tried not to waste words or time frequently may have
[01:27:10] appeared to have been spur of the moment response but it was generally prepared even though they were
[01:27:15] volunteers as all paratroopers are the grunts were different the grunts were by nature different
[01:27:22] they were not career men in the same sense that officers and most of the senior NCOs were
[01:27:26] career men and they were not sensitive to opportunities for promotion or self a grand
[01:27:31] diesmen but because individuals are aggressive and competitive by nature the grunts did require an
[01:27:37] opportunity to express those instincts or in a word a chance to operate I knew the grunt hell I was
[01:27:44] one of them promoted grunt to be sure but still a grunt I'd been an enlisted man over half my entire
[01:27:50] career I had fought as one and been wounded as one and I understood what made a grunt tick because
[01:27:55] I knew what made me tick I'd also been fortunate enough to gather enough psychological insight
[01:28:02] to comprehend them and myself even more deeply and thoroughly at the same time gaining enough military
[01:28:08] experience to recognize that they were the best raw material in the world they were bigger and
[01:28:13] healthier and more intelligent and better educated than any soldier the US army had ever had the
[01:28:18] opportunity to use before and they were superior to any soldier any other country was getting
[01:28:25] even with our training shortcomings and there were by god plentiful the grunts and Vietnam were
[01:28:31] still the best trained men around as well as the best fed and best equipped more over I think I
[01:28:37] recognize something that must have slipped by most of the brass including Westmoreland and later Abrams
[01:28:43] that the length of the hair on a man's head wasn't nearly as important as the caliber of the
[01:28:47] brain inside I knew that the grunt was a man just like me and that he was entitled to the same
[01:28:57] respect I myself demanded his dignity was sacred it could never be changed the commander could
[01:29:06] scream and rant and rage and curse like a sailor but he could never encroach on the troopers dignity.
[01:29:14] If the leader attacks his troopers dignity the trooper has but two alternatives to fold up
[01:29:19] roll over and die or strike back I was determined to follow the pattern that had worked for me in the
[01:29:25] past to allow my men to make at least as many of the same kind of mistakes as I had made and god
[01:29:31] knows I had made my share and more to deal with them honestly to to express admiration respect love
[01:29:38] patriotism and my own conviction that he represented with all my faults with all its faults the
[01:29:45] greatest country in the history of civilization and the mightiest combat arm this universe ever
[01:29:50] assembled under a single power to persuade him that it not really been equipment and mass production
[01:29:56] in a one world war one world war two in Korea for us but rather blood guts courage know how and a
[01:30:04] steadfast devotion to a cause.
[01:30:16] Respect to your people.
[01:30:17] I laid out the strategy for my battalion it was some lousy war when a piddling battalion commander
[01:30:28] had to lay out a master strategy but that's the way it was hell nobody else laid out anything
[01:30:32] for these men either from a national or an international perspective I ordered to them to give them
[01:30:38] some kind of purpose and a reason at the battalion level at least got to know why you're doing
[01:30:43] and what you're doing and he's saying they're not even hearing that fast forward a little bit
[01:30:51] in fact the whole damn US army in Vietnam was crazy the generals west moreland Abrams pierced
[01:30:57] Ross and depue Richardson you will ramsey and the rest were all working on the premise that
[01:31:05] they were the best in that whatever problems we were having were the fault of the commanders at
[01:31:09] lower levels.
[01:31:15] Bullshit.
[01:31:17] The major leadership problem in Vietnam was the generals and the rest of the senior officer
[01:31:22] corps the colonels the lieutenant colonels and the majors the captains the tenets and list
[01:31:27] men weren't to blame the generals were has bins or never bends from world war two vintage
[01:31:32] who had paper images built up by the public information people so again you know we're we're
[01:31:46] reading this book and really he's placing the blame on everybody else which is not good
[01:31:54] but he's telling what it looks like from his perspective.
[01:31:57] He says about those generals they walked and talked like leaders in war ribbons and
[01:32:03] uniform so it was only reasonable that back in Washington they were regarded as leaders and we're
[01:32:07] listened to.
[01:32:10] If you were in the military you must be a great leader right we still have that anybody that was
[01:32:16] in the military must be a great leader.
[01:32:18] So I wish it was true it's not always true unfortunately.
[01:32:31] Again he wasn't just talking he's guys not just a talker this guy is not when he's talking
[01:32:39] smack about these other leaders he's not just talking smack and and say no they're not leading
[01:32:44] he's leading he's actually leading there's all kinds of stories in here here's one I cross the
[01:32:50] yard there out on the mission across the yard to the bunker and nail myself up against it's
[01:32:53] outer-redge.
[01:32:54] Chewhoe I shouted using the name of the program we had set up for leniency and return for immediate
[01:32:59] unresisting surrender.
[01:33:01] Chewhoe as always there was no response I waited then stepped back and fired two quick rounds
[01:33:06] into the sandbags around the doorway then stepping back against the wall I lifted a grenade
[01:33:10] from my belt the old woman on the porch screamed and there was one hell of a scuffling inside the
[01:33:15] bronzer bunker.
[01:33:17] They tripped all over each other coming out hands first two hoi two hoi me two hoi two hoi they
[01:33:23] were shouting I figured you were I mumbled to myself there were three of them two in
[01:33:27] khakis and the wounded guy stripped down to his shorts.
[01:33:31] I nudged them toward warden keep them covered I said I'll get the bunker I'll get it
[01:33:35] searched midi said trotting across toward me God dammit keep that group covered I shouted I'll get
[01:33:41] the damn damned bunker we all get paid by the same people.
[01:33:46] I don't think it was bravado it was just that I had learned years before that if you wanted to be
[01:33:51] followed then you had to get your house out and lead by setting the example.
[01:33:56] If I expected other people to go down inside bunkers and holes after the enemy then I had better
[01:34:00] be ready to do it myself this time it was my turn I kept my rifle in front.
[01:34:09] Someone shouted grenade and the others hit the dirt I dropped them one knee holding my head down
[01:34:14] low in front of my shoulders I saw the guy break out of the bushing out of the bush with another
[01:34:19] grenade in his hands I squeezed twice on the trigger and watched the rounds slam his two is chest
[01:34:23] driving him up against one of the palms bouncing him off into the bushes two of our men had been hit
[01:34:28] by the explosion I didn't remember even hearing their grenade detonate except vaguely perhaps that's
[01:34:34] how unimportant grenades were for me at least I'd seen them all over the world and had used
[01:34:39] them and had them used against me over and over I did not respect them as a weapon they were charges
[01:34:46] they blew up and out lay one an arms length stay down flat and the worst you would do
[01:34:52] was give you a concussion run and you got some shrapnel in your ass watch him I said and turn to
[01:34:58] the ray that grenade came from the building you take that side and I'll take this one I turned the
[01:35:03] muzzle of the M16 west and followed it around the building I heard the ray fire just then a grenade
[01:35:10] exploded and I got the building just in time to see the ray kicking away the reads and dragging
[01:35:15] the body from between the false walls the guy had been wedged into a section about the size of a bird
[01:35:21] cage the red nudged the bloody the bloody body with his foot a loser sir he said quietly gently
[01:35:27] with that same catch in his voice that you hear in the movies just before tears a god damn loser
[01:35:32] dink he rolled it over gently the guy had been a real trooper and he had tried to do just as he
[01:35:38] had been told just as so many of our kids had been told and would have tried had they been in his place
[01:35:45] uncle hoe would never even know the poor bastard was dead nor would he have given a shit if he had
[01:35:50] known like those on our side he was just another statistic we left him there in the dirt
[01:36:04] we started back down the trail at a truck and outright run was out of the question because
[01:36:10] more than likely if you broke out of the bush running you were a dead ass even at our speed it was
[01:36:15] more than a few seconds before we reach a large grassy clearing the american lieutenant
[01:36:19] the advisor was on my left as we entered the clearing and the rest of were standing around in
[01:36:26] no particular formation across the clearing I saw one man a Vietnamese holding the young girl's
[01:36:33] hair with his left hand bending her head back bearing her throat his right arm was around her neck
[01:36:41] and a knife in his right hand was dug deeply into her flesh beneath and to the left of her
[01:36:47] softfrogus all he had to do was pull and she was gone one of the children was hanging onto her
[01:36:55] pajamas screaming and the other child's face was being steadily squashed into the sand by the foot
[01:37:02] of another Vietnamese soldier the child was suffocating I shoved the american lieutenant out of the way
[01:37:09] and shouted something staring at the guy with the knife in the girls throat he was staring at me too
[01:37:19] these Vietnamese these are South Vietnamese soldiers and this the first person that he pushed out of the
[01:37:24] way was a was an american advisor so he comes on this scene in this in this clearing and there's
[01:37:35] an american lieutenant he pushes that guy out of the way and these Vietnamese soldiers that the american
[01:37:40] lieutenant was an advisor to all this is happening so these are these are South Vietnamese soldiers
[01:37:45] with the with the young girls we have pulled them to hold the knife to this young girls throat so
[01:37:50] this is a ally so this Vietnamese soldiers staring at herber with the knife to the girls throat
[01:38:01] back to the book with great ease he pulled the blade across her blood spirited and gushed down
[01:38:09] the front of her pajamas and she dropped to the darkening sand pulling the child with her it took
[01:38:14] no more than a second from the instant he moved the knife until she crumpled in a lifeless
[01:38:19] heat per baby still screaming still plying at her legs her killer jumped back in the group of
[01:38:24] Vietnamese pulling with him the guy who'd been suffocating the child I should have shot them on the
[01:38:29] spot while I could still identify them the rest of the detainees were lined up against the bushes
[01:38:35] four of the men were already dead lying off in the grass to my right with their heads blown away
[01:38:40] a Vietnamese soldier was parading up and down in front of the survivors waving a pistol
[01:38:46] I noticed that one of the four dead men was the stud we had captured in the hut
[01:38:52] I felt myself go empty something dreamed from me in that moment that you that I have yet to replace
[01:38:58] you dumb son of a bitch I screamed grabbing the american lieutenant by the by his shirt
[01:39:03] in that instant I was only a flick away from killing him it passed I calmed and turned him loose
[01:39:10] just what the hell did you let happen here lieutenant he was only an advisor he said
[01:39:15] there they were only doing a job they knew their business guerrillas weren't protected under the
[01:39:21] Geneva Accords they were following orders oh god I thought a big badass to american
[01:39:28] who had never killed anyone in combat or captured a single prisoner legitimately had played hell
[01:39:32] with these poor devils big badass to all american boy god I was frustrated I raised my hand to
[01:39:38] slap him clear across the area I lowered it you get all your scrap together and then get the hell
[01:39:44] out of here I screamed at him so I have a job I glanced down at the four dead men and over to the
[01:39:49] woman's body not anymore you don't lieutenant he was staring at me with what seemed to be disbelief
[01:39:54] I moved his near to him as possible without touching now get your people out of here out of here
[01:39:59] I said quietly and calmly you're finished here the rest of this like the charges will take care
[01:40:06] back at base so he witnesses this this this this atrocity and gets back to base
[01:40:17] runs it up the chain of command tells to frankly Franklin frankly Franklin he tells Franklin what happens
[01:40:31] Franklin finally asked what had happened and I told him every last sword detail right down to the blood
[01:40:35] leaping from the girls throat Herbert you're a goddamn liar he said I sure to my wasn't lying there are other
[01:40:41] witnesses sir then you're exaggerating he said did the american did the lieutenant take part yes sir
[01:40:49] he was in charge he had assumed responsibility from sergeant warden but did you see him do any killing
[01:40:57] no sir I didn't then you're a goddamn liar there were no US personnel involved he said god
[01:41:02] damn it Herbert you're always coming in with these wild-ass exaggerated stories trying to make trouble
[01:41:07] what the hell is wrong with you you're getting carried away maybe you're getting too old
[01:41:24] a day or two so so they start going through and this is what's really interesting about this book is they have
[01:41:30] like the the actual documents from this guy Warden I started in first class Warden
[01:41:38] during the period of 14 February that's Valentine's Day 1969 was a platoon sergeant for so he explains
[01:41:44] what he saw happen and you can get this book and read those documents then this happens a
[01:41:54] day or two after the St. Valentine's Day massacre which we just read about a black trooper named white
[01:42:00] refused to go into the field and offered his refusal loud and clear out in the battalion street where he
[01:42:06] could be heard by one and all you're going out white just like everybody else I told him
[01:42:12] like hell I am you son of a bitch I ain't fighting for no whiteies right white
[01:42:18] you're going to fight for your country or for your dollars or for anything else you can think of
[01:42:23] but by god you're going like hell I am he said taking off his glasses and slamming them against the
[01:42:29] ground they were unbroken he stepped on them and ground them into tiny pieces now you bastard he said
[01:42:34] I ain't going because I can't see I shrugged and laughed at him so I'll have you put on a
[01:42:41] listing post guys with that eyes always do better at night you dumb son of a bitch he laughed you
[01:42:46] don't understand you send me out there and I'll dessert know you won't white because out there baby
[01:42:52] ain't back here you leave the guys out there and you're on your own I tapped them on the chest
[01:42:58] but listen I'll tell you what I'll do you go a wall out there and make it back here and I'll give you a
[01:43:03] bronze star and even if you don't I'll see to it that you get a purple heart out there when you're on
[01:43:09] your own your anybody's and everybody's meet if Vc or NVA don't get you the locals will you are
[01:43:18] money and they're all bounty hunters I'll cut out as soon as I get back then know you won't
[01:43:23] because you either straighten out here either straight now out out there or when the company returns
[01:43:28] you'll be transferred to a unit that replaces them you reached into his shirt pocket and pulled
[01:43:33] out another pair of glasses he was swaggering away he swaggering as he walked away toward the helicopter
[01:43:40] big guy big bad guy you'll get yours baby
[01:43:46] the best I could do is hope that the best I could hope for would be that he would do a good job it
[01:43:51] was his only chance if he didn't cut it he was going back out with the next unit just as I had promised
[01:43:57] it was the only way reward the right response and do everything you can to get it most of time it
[01:44:04] worked with white it didn't so just to kind of debrief that we heard earlier about his policies
[01:44:13] he doesn't want to punish people for acting badly so if this guy with his old Italian commander acted
[01:44:18] this way he'd get okay you're you're in trouble you need you need to go stay in the barracks
[01:44:25] and you're going to go to you see MJ and whatever but he's not going to go fight which is what
[01:44:29] he actually wanted so his deal is not only are you going to go fight but if you don't do a good job
[01:44:36] when this when this platoon gets back from this mission you're going out with the next platoon
[01:44:41] until you do a freaking good job he performed poorly in the field just as he vowed he would
[01:44:52] and I had him held at the gate when his unit came back
[01:44:57] I had asked children which is his senior on to go to get the very best trooper he could find
[01:45:01] to guard white until the replacement unit he was going to join came out someone who wouldn't
[01:45:07] scare and he came up with pfc shnelling don't take any crap from him I told shnelling and watch
[01:45:16] out the unit coming out will pick him up that was it except that shnelling drilled him through the
[01:45:24] head and killed him right outside the gate white had some words and shnelling had paid no attention
[01:45:31] white had made a threat and then gone for his rifle he got it to his shoulder before shnelling
[01:45:36] squeezed the trigger and the MP at the gate had seen and heard it all thank God it was that cut and
[01:45:43] dry shnelling had done his job I brought in the criminal investigation division people they
[01:45:50] questioned everyone took statements and that was it except that later in the day I had shnelling
[01:45:56] into the office a crowd of white's friends gathered outside chanting we want shnelling we want
[01:46:03] shnelling he killed a brother he killed a brother we want shnelling we want shnelling
[01:46:12] freaking nasty I'm this is like horrible so again just to make sure everyone's tracking
[01:46:23] he puts in the guy comes back he hadn't white comes back hadn't done a good job
[01:46:27] so he's got him standing by for the next platoon that's gonna go out while he's standing by
[01:46:35] Herbert puts a guy to guard him this guy named shnelling shnelling's out there guarding him
[01:46:42] white makes a move shnelling kills him luckily there's a witness which is the MP
[01:46:52] who had seen and heard it all so in now they're in the office of Herbert and there's a crowd out
[01:47:06] front of white's friends saying we want shnelling we want shnelling he killed a brother he killed a brother
[01:47:15] and here's what Herbert does I reached over and picked up my M16
[01:47:18] look shnelling you are now a spec for so he promotes him and says not because you killed a man
[01:47:28] but because you didn't fail to do it when it was your job now about that out there that's up to you
[01:47:35] I'll tell you what I do I'd walk out there and end it right now I'd pick out the biggest mouth
[01:47:41] out there and walk up and explain the facts tell them you tell them that you just made
[01:47:47] corporal and if they don't clear out you might take it into your mind to try for sergeant
[01:47:55] I jacked around into the M16 chamber I'll cover you from up here and if anyone so much
[01:48:00] as raises a weapon I'll drop him that's the least I can do I shrugged
[01:48:09] he stepped through the door and walked over to the group I could not hear what he said but they
[01:48:13] dispersed and I never heard white's name again which is sad too that a man could die and snap
[01:48:21] just fade out of people's minds and disappear
[01:48:30] you're gnarly want to talk about some leadership challenges that's like insane right
[01:48:38] that's insane
[01:48:38] yeah I mean does this kind of stuff still happen like now yeah it's just seems so almost like wild
[01:48:52] Westish oh yeah that that's that section right there like that's a that's an insane the whole thing is
[01:49:01] freaking crazy yeah yeah that is crazy I mean like there's so many elements too you know
[01:49:11] where it's like all right you know you have a friend he gets straight up just killed but
[01:49:20] you know and it's like it's hard it's one of those deals where you kind of got to take sides a
[01:49:24] little bit or whatever right if you're in that mix or whatever so your guy your friend your brother
[01:49:29] gets killed by another guy so it's like all right we got to see vengeance this is obviously
[01:49:33] out of line obviously not part of this you know we're all the same team where you're going to kill this
[01:49:37] guy all you know no matter what happens kind of like you didn't have to kill him it's easy to be like
[01:49:41] you didn't have to kill him whatever so yeah of course so they want vengeance they want just
[01:49:46] as they want like all this stuff or whatever and they kind of have a point in in a in a way
[01:49:52] especially if they don't know the whole thing they kind of have a point yeah well you're also
[01:49:56] so let's face it there's a huge assumption that the lone MP is just of the big witness right
[01:50:05] this one I mean what if what if shaleings friends with the MP so hey I got this issue with this guy
[01:50:11] or hey we just had beef and I shot this guy you got me and he's like yeah that's what happened
[01:50:16] he showed it is weapon right one guy one is it's it's it's it's such a freaking nightmare
[01:50:23] and then okay then then it gets worse so where you know he's he's like hey this is what you
[01:50:29] should do this is what I would just crazy but there's a lot of no and the thing is but that's
[01:50:36] not gonna I mean of course it worked right but we don't we don't even know what he said we don't do
[01:50:40] in the moment before he went out but that's not gonna work but these guys like they want to
[01:50:46] they want to kill me already you know I already killed they're got like we're at war right now
[01:50:50] with this war within the war going on right now here's what here's the only thing that makes me think
[01:50:57] well how it turned out you think well I I wonder if his friends were kind of like
[01:51:02] look we know why and why it was kind of like he maybe he you know maybe they knew what type of
[01:51:09] person he was and you had that he was close to the ragged edge or whatever but god I don't even know
[01:51:15] what to say about this like it's just a freaking nightmare this whole book is freaking crazy like
[01:51:25] when you think let look at what we just read you got this freaking soldier killing another soldier you
[01:51:32] got the woman getting her throat slash there's four other people executed it's madness all right
[01:51:48] under what circumstances do you slay the girls through because obviously the girls not military
[01:51:54] nothing like this yeah mean the you know oh she's a vc sympathizer that's you know probably what their claim was
[01:52:03] yeah yeah I guess I will give you no circumstance if that's what you're looking for right
[01:52:09] well I shouldn't say that you know this you know you could obviously be in some kind of a
[01:52:14] hand-to-hand combat scenario where you've got an enemy fighter that happens to be female
[01:52:18] you know could happen with their baby okay yeah I mean there's a thing okay in this scenario
[01:52:26] it makes no sense whatsoever in this scenario Herbert saying look that's a freaking war crime
[01:52:31] that's what he's saying that's what we're two like Herbert he's you know like on the like he's
[01:52:38] uh what I say earlier he's a straight-laced guy right he's like a straight-laced guy
[01:52:41] that's when he sees stuff like that it he's unacceptable to and and that's what's about the
[01:52:50] about the guy white getting killed he's not the Herbert's not the kind when I'm Herbert
[01:52:55] you remember in Korean War they go hey burned down this village he's like I'm not gonna do it
[01:53:00] they they bring that up and that's kind of why focused on some of that stuff and um it when we did
[01:53:04] the last podcast you know he had had this he he he mentioned that they had uh the first black
[01:53:11] replacement showing up and he was like we didn't you know we don't the what the troops didn't care
[01:53:17] if you did a good job you were we're good he talked about the fact that he was raised
[01:53:24] by that doctor that was like hey all these people in the world they're people like you they're
[01:53:28] out there aren't trying to feed their families so he's seems like he's this kind of straight
[01:53:34] laced for lack of a better word good person man I like to sit down with this dude he's not alive any more
[01:53:45] button I know you haven't seen the movie Platoon pull you should watch it that shows a lot of chaos
[01:53:58] mayhem but all these things that you read all the books you read about Vietnam and all the movies
[01:54:05] that you see about Vietnam like it's all wrapped up in this in these scenarios that are just freaking
[01:54:11] insane I mean one of your soldiers kills one of your other soldiers after you say hey you you got
[01:54:22] to go out it's like nuts and then you're thinking well look then you're thinking is it worth it
[01:54:30] like hey this guy white I could have just said all right fine you're not going out right fine
[01:54:34] you go see I'll put you on kp dude you can go peel potatoes you know what I mean and then what happens
[01:54:39] a bit I and then other people like well I don't want to go out either so now what are we doing yeah
[01:54:46] I mean it kind of could be viewed as like yeah man that's like that's how it needs to be almost
[01:54:51] yeah it could be and this is why it's that you got to be very careful about painting yourself
[01:54:56] into a corner right you have to be very careful about painting yourself into a corner in life
[01:55:03] especially as a little in from a leadership position if you paint yourself into a corner you're
[01:55:07] you're painting in that corner there's no moving there's no moving so for me
[01:55:15] well as I look at this I'm okay I got a guy that doesn't want to go what can I get from him what
[01:55:19] can I do with him how can I talk to him and again we don't know any of the history the guy
[01:55:24] would know how bad of a soldier he was we know his behavior was I mean obviously he's calling the
[01:55:28] he's calling his commander like a son of a bitch and all this stuff so he's not you can tell he's not
[01:55:33] down for the cause right so why is that how do we build a relationship with that guy
[01:55:41] and there's some guys that are totally overboard right they're gone like you're not going to get
[01:55:45] him back well he there and if he's there why you actually have them out on patrol but if everything
[01:55:51] you is kind of blocking white you're sort of you're sort of like hey this is what everyone this
[01:55:57] is what you're going to do and you have no you paint yourself in that corner and you have no way out of it
[01:56:02] hmm going back to the book I should never have had any problems in Vietnam because it was an
[01:56:16] infantry war infantry and helicopters with a different quality of commanders the helicopters could have
[01:56:23] played a very important role in command and control the unfortunate fact was that the commanders
[01:56:28] kept their butts glued in the seats in the birds I don't think I can overemphasize the weaknesses
[01:56:33] and heritness from 1,500 feet up war was simply a lot of little guys in green running here and there
[01:56:41] shooting up the landscape the birdmen he's talking about the commander's fast forward a little bit
[01:56:46] the birdmen may have been commanders in the technical sense of the word but they weren't leaders
[01:56:51] and the grunts knew it down there was their world it was a ground war an infantry exercise and
[01:57:00] as infantry we could have won it man for man we were better and we could have won it with less than
[01:57:07] half the people we had there all we had to do was get rid of the wasted headquarters
[01:57:12] chaff get rid of the px's in the state houses and the clubs and the massage parlors and the pools
[01:57:18] and the pizza houses and the commissaries and get down to fighting an infantry war we had the training
[01:57:25] and we had the men who could have done the job the problem was not only a lack of command leadership
[01:57:31] but a lack of distinct mission we didn't have one before I got there we didn't have one while I was
[01:57:37] there and we never had one after I left but an army requires a mission it desperately needs some
[01:57:45] direction towards a specific goal it was all charts and graphs for us with machine technicians
[01:57:51] like the West Point engineers running the show I don't think we have to be conditioned to kill
[01:57:56] we need no training to destroy will built for that killing comes easy established no rules
[01:58:03] and leave a vacuum and won what you end up with our me lie and cool away the absence of policy
[01:58:10] and mission was a policy in itself need to know what the freaking mission is by the way
[01:58:29] in war freaking absolutely I guess we'll in your normal life yes absolutely in your business
[01:58:35] and your job yes and you know the freaking mission is fast forward as we continue to score
[01:58:43] every night Franklin began to increase his visits to the field finally he made it a point to be on
[01:58:48] hand personally to personally count the bodies and I found myself as his constant escort guiding him
[01:58:54] from one dead man to the next and standing by while he snapped photos it was another syndrome
[01:58:59] the guys that didn't kill anybody were the ones who broke their asses to get a picture
[01:59:03] what the hell it would probably have been the same way with Indian scalps if we had cameras back then
[01:59:11] so Franklin is out there kind of coming out and he goes through a bunch of this stuff
[01:59:19] there's a guy named Grimshaw and we're gonna hear his name later
[01:59:26] one of his company commanders Grimshaw said a dead VC is a dead VC and a dead NVA is a dead NVA
[01:59:32] and a dead VCI is a dead VCI except of course when killed by the second battalion
[01:59:39] then there are only dead if Franklin touches the touches his toe to them
[01:59:44] and they better be wearing a uniform and have a weapon what the hell is I trying to do Franklin
[01:59:48] asked I had to be an ass to move to rifle companies that distance in the dark why they might have
[01:59:54] opened up on each other if either of them had become disoriented and besides he said it was one
[01:59:59] big waste we could have taken them all in a court and search and saved all the inconvenience
[02:00:05] so meanwhile while all this stuff is happening the the brigade is keeping battalion scores
[02:00:15] they're keeping scores to figure out who's the best battalion who's the best battalion
[02:00:20] they keep track of a bunch of different things enemy killed an a killed an action body count
[02:00:26] enemy prisoners of war enemy contacts enemy weapons captured number of a wall so who's
[02:00:33] absent how many people you got absent without lead how many article 15s have you done meaning
[02:00:37] how many times have you punished somebody how many delinquencies have you had how many malaria
[02:00:43] cases do you have how many relishments do you have how many special courts do you have
[02:00:49] and then they take all these different numbers and they put them into like one final number
[02:00:53] so here's how the numbers shake out basically they shake out the second battalion so her birds
[02:01:00] battalion is winning in all categories it's not even close for enemy killed an action it's
[02:01:07] uh the other battalions are 14 4 29 and 36 second battalion has 84 so more than twice as much
[02:01:15] as the next battalion for enemy captured listen to these numbers eight zero zero and three
[02:01:24] how many does the second battalion have 90 for enemy contacts it's 34 27 37 60 and
[02:01:35] second battalion has 66 for enemy weapons captured it's 15 11 3 and 17
[02:01:41] 16 second battalion has 57 so this is not even it's almost like it's not even close for
[02:01:48] absent ways that without leave so this is this should you want below number here it's 14 24 26
[02:01:55] and 24 and what is second battalion have eight they only have eight people that have gone a
[02:02:00] wall for article 15s the numbers are 39 56 57 and 52 what is second battalion have 24
[02:02:08] for delinquency reports 17 9 11 10 second battalion has five malaria they're all the same
[02:02:19] reenlistments listen to this reenlistments the numbers are zero zero 40 and zero
[02:02:26] no one wants to frequency in what is second battalion have 53 so the total score and they have
[02:02:36] whatever they have this wave making all this into one number second battalion for this
[02:02:42] particular month this is February 1969 has 420 points during the lead and then the other
[02:02:51] ones are 180 145 70 and 20 I mean just combat ineffective right and they're and by the way this is
[02:03:00] so they're getting graded by Franklin and Barnes getting graded and they're crushing
[02:03:08] second battalion under herbert is absolutely crushing everything but the hits just keep on coming
[02:03:17] there's some military intelligence interrogation rooms that are on their little base
[02:03:23] and herbert pays a visit I walked into one of the rooms and back and knocked lightly on the door
[02:03:27] one night who's there Herbert just a moment sir someone answered and second later the door
[02:03:33] swung inward sergeant Carmody greeted me come in sir I squeeze past him and close the door behind me
[02:03:39] inside in addition to Carmody were captain bowers of Vietnamese man and one of the honey's
[02:03:46] the wild cats had captured in the morning she was seated to my left in a chair against the wall
[02:03:51] just off the corner Carmody was standing to a right my left and the Vietnamese man was sitting just
[02:03:56] off my right foot facing the girl in the chair their knees only a couple inches apart captain
[02:04:01] bowers was just behind the Vietnamese man sitting in a chair and leaning over the viet's shoulder
[02:04:05] the girl was moaning and trembling find anything out I asked turning to Carmody she claims
[02:04:12] she was out picking waterbed bugs sir he said and laughed what patrol where was it headed what about
[02:04:19] what about the patrol where was it headed Carmody turned to her and asked something in Vietnamese
[02:04:24] she shook her head he hit her with the back of his hand raking it down along her face you're a
[02:04:30] fucking liar he shouted blood began to rush into the long abrasion on her cheek it began to happen
[02:04:37] in a rush I turned to bowers thinking he would say something Carmody said something in Vietnamese
[02:04:42] bowers nodded to the Vietnamese man in front of him and touched his shoulder with his hand the girl
[02:04:47] screamed I glanced down and saw for the first time that there were wires from her body to a telephone
[02:04:55] between the viet's knees he was cranking it I grabbed the wires and yanked damn near lifting the
[02:05:03] viet up with them before the wires separated from the phone it clattered to the floor are you crazy
[02:05:09] bowers I yelled so just so you understand these these telephone machines that you can power them
[02:05:16] by cranking them this is an old school like telephone and so that's where he had to have these
[02:05:21] they're basically electro shock electro electro cutinger are you crazy bowers I yelled sir I
[02:05:27] what the hell kind of crap are you pulling here sir I go get okay sir major okay and says I don't
[02:05:32] give a damn what he says you go get him I said I turned to comedy and knock this off until this thing
[02:05:36] is settled bowers left and Carmody the viet and I followed him out of the hall leaving the girl
[02:05:40] alone in the little room in a moment bowers returned major okay and isn't here he said where the
[02:05:45] hell is he he's gone down to brigades sir and behind him through the open doorway I saw the major
[02:05:50] getting into a Jeep I left to and walked down to Franklin's office where not surprisingly okay
[02:05:56] was still deep in conversation with the deputy commander Franklin sigled to meet a hold up until he
[02:06:01] was finished when okay left Franklin called me in and immediately began screaming we were right
[02:06:06] back where he left off you son of a bitch he ran it you dirty rotten son of a bitch how many times
[02:06:10] if I warn you to stay the hell away from MI or have your tap cut off it seemed like the time for accuracy
[02:06:17] four times sir I said I did you understand yes sir but I understand torture too I don't give
[02:06:23] a shit about that I sir God damn it herpurver don't you sir me I gave you a director or did you
[02:06:29] understand it yes sir but they were torturing a viet and he said you personally see them torturing
[02:06:33] this girl at least he knew it had been a girl yes sir they US soldiers no sir this viet
[02:06:38] to meet God damn it Herbert how many times must I explain the rules of land warfare to you over here
[02:06:43] what the Vietnamese do is none of our damn business but sir the guy was cranking this phone generator
[02:06:48] while bowers was who is cranking the generator this interpreter I guess and was he viet to meet
[02:06:54] yes sir but and was bowers cranking no sir but then God damn it that's the end of it okay and said
[02:07:00] that's all there is to know he lifted his hand as shook his finger one more god damn interference
[02:07:06] Herbert and you're all washed up at MI understand no sir I don't carmety was did you see
[02:07:12] carmety crank the phone no sir did you see any US crank that phone no sir then what's your bitch
[02:07:18] it was the first time I had to really compose a sentence for one thing I told him it was a
[02:07:23] violation of US army directives as well as Geneva Accords and the rules of land warfare
[02:07:28] and for another I finished it just isn't army oh you son of a bitch he said you're so
[02:07:35] God damn righteous you never did anything like that right no sir I haven't he slapped the girl
[02:07:41] end and you never have honor of it is that correct that is correct sir I but you saw comedy
[02:07:47] slap her huh yes sir I did and and so all at once you're the judge the jury and the executioner
[02:07:53] is that correct Herbert no sir I know sir I know sir I know sir I tell you what you are Herbert you're
[02:07:59] a disloyal and you're maybe getting kind of old you just can't stomach it anymore what the hell
[02:08:04] is a matter with you look he said with relative benevolence in his voice let me explain these are the
[02:08:11] enemy even you must be able to understand that right these are the guys who killed your buddies
[02:08:18] whom did she kill sir God damn it I'm talking about the enemy in general he said raising his hand
[02:08:23] let me put it this way their VC I decided there was no sense in carrying out this farce any further
[02:08:30] and we were supposed to be soldiers and we are supposed to be soldiers sir American soldiers
[02:08:36] I want to make a charge I'd like to charge charge my ass you've already made a charge and now it's
[02:08:41] an investigation and I'll take care of that not you you just be able to back your mouth with sworn
[02:08:47] verified testimony sure I said sir anytime yeah so again it's very strange not very strange but
[02:09:04] you can see this guy he seems to be trying to do the right thing but man he's making some enemies
[02:09:10] I guess big part of his me trying my best to look at it from all or more than just herbards perspective
[02:09:23] and he kind of got it meant when you think about it where you don't want to like
[02:09:29] okay when you're in a complex situation and you have like a goal and then you have all these rules
[02:09:35] sometimes those rules do get kind of looked over some on a smaller level right and sometimes it
[02:09:44] can be more efficient meanwhile you got this guy who's kind of by the book and most people are
[02:09:53] most people I'm pretty I almost want to say everybody's not going to be by the book hundred
[02:09:59] percent of the time okay in one way or another and you get a group of people and they're they're
[02:10:04] carrying out a goal whatever and and it's working and it's working out and they're okay well that's
[02:10:11] an assumption yeah because it doesn't because let's face it if we just look well how well the
[02:10:16] battalions are doing his battalions doing the best and he's kind of flying the the righteous path yeah
[02:10:22] yeah fully and yeah this is this particular story aside I'm saying in general okay and then you get
[02:10:28] whether be a new guy or just somebody there who's always like how should I's not in my
[02:10:34] commanding but like nitpicking or certain things and it kind of jams up your whole approach to
[02:10:40] what you're doing sure it could be better or not or whatever but it becomes kind of a nuisance you know
[02:10:46] well okay I mean I see what you're saying but let's let's remember that this guy is witnessing
[02:10:55] murders tortures sexual assaults which I didn't really cover rapes which I didn't really cover but
[02:11:01] they're in here he's he's seeing all kinds of horrible shit this isn't somebody this isn't all
[02:11:07] of these people are kind of bending the rules to get the job done the same that yeah fully and that's
[02:11:14] what I mean so and that's what I mean just what you said like people bending the rules to get the job
[02:11:20] done kind of a thing right we we understand that yes and he understands it right remember the guy
[02:11:26] that got told hey bring back the mermaids on your patrol and and the guy says this is stupid and
[02:11:32] Herbert says well it's an order and he says fuck them remember that part he's down with bending
[02:11:37] the rules if the rules don't make sense right yeah fully and uh and yes that is true and we got a good
[02:11:45] bird's eye view of the whole deal for sure but the guy this guy that he's talking to Franklin
[02:11:52] yeah Franklin from his perspective he might be looking at it as hey we're bending the rules to get
[02:11:57] the job done he might be genuine feeling that he might be he might be now what you have to fall back on
[02:12:05] as you have to you have to fall back and this is a tough one you have to fall back not only on
[02:12:11] what is the right thing to do but you also have to bounce that off of one is legal yeah okay so
[02:12:18] for the young leaders out there especially military leaders but this applies to anything this applies
[02:12:23] to business because look there's things there's things you do in business where oh there's the right
[02:12:28] thing to do and then there's the wrong thing to do and then there's the legal thing to do
[02:12:33] and then yeah there's the criminal thing to do so when you're doing something hey listen I can
[02:12:41] explain this you know the the CNN test have you ever heard of this before look if I can go on CNN
[02:12:49] and say hey this is why I made this decision and you don't feel shame because of what you did
[02:12:55] that's definitely part of the test the other thing you got to remember is what is legal because
[02:13:04] if you let and this is something you can tell you your your employees or your troops
[02:13:09] you got to remember about what's legal because someone that should steer because look if if
[02:13:17] you're let's say you're in a you're in a platoon you're out on a target and you find somebody that's
[02:13:25] killed Americans right they freaking kill they have the bodies and you catch them with the bodies
[02:13:32] and with the freaking bloody knife there's almost no one that would say okay well I don't feel
[02:13:38] like killing those bad guys right there's a guy with a bloody knife you see them killing Americans
[02:13:44] to say hey do the right thing a lot of people look I don't know the right thing to do is we kill
[02:13:49] that guy we execute them you have you have to remember that that is not legal you are not allowed
[02:13:54] to do that so you have to get your people to understand that regardless of how you feel
[02:14:02] it's not just to see an end test because that kind of past the CNN test hey I showed up
[02:14:06] this guy killed a bunch of Americans and we freaking we I shot him and you can that's the
[02:14:12] way it is and I I'd feel no shame because of it you pass the CNN test guess what you can still go
[02:14:17] to you can sell what a jail it's legally wrong so as a leader what you have to do you have to
[02:14:22] sort of merge all these ideas into one final thought and you have to take the fact that hey what
[02:14:31] this is not legal to do this this is not legal to do this now there's others we could come up with
[02:14:38] scenarios where doing the legal thing still isn't the right thing and it's actually wrong it's wrong
[02:14:46] to do that and sometimes you may have to break that rule but what we're talking about here is
[02:14:51] they're doing things that are not legal yeah so regardless of how you feel you're doing something
[02:14:57] that is not legal on a very in a very big way these aren't minor charges these are war crimes
[02:15:03] scenarios which right this isn't like hey we've been through we we left some freaking
[02:15:07] mermaids out in the field which is pretty easy to argue right hey listen my guys were already tired
[02:15:15] we were if we're gonna carry these things it was gonna bog us down we had a better chance
[02:15:17] to get an ambush it was gonna be a problem I left them okay got it that's not war crimes
[02:15:23] yeah so there's a there's a difference yeah yeah there does there comes a point where it gets
[02:15:30] like you just can't defend certain things you know and yeah especially when you're talking about
[02:15:34] like you got to remember that's not even just that you can't defend him because if I roll up
[02:15:38] and I find an ISIS fighter that killed three people you can defend that all day you can defend
[02:15:45] oh yeah I saw him I'm a shot him he killed three Americans I saw him doing it you can defend
[02:15:50] that all day long but it's not legal so now you got to deal with the ramifications whatever those are
[02:15:55] yeah you're seeing the movie cobra no come on so best of us alone cobra I have not seen it
[02:16:04] dang all watchbook two new watch cobra no not deal so there's a fight there's a fight in the
[02:16:10] beginning where this psycho guy takes over the supermarket or whatever right and cobra is kind of one
[02:16:15] of these guys he uses excessive force you know kind of like demolition men same actor by the way so
[02:16:20] that's just so either way so cobra ends up killing this guy right and then the the
[02:16:26] press comes not CNN but the press comes and they're trying to interview cobra and they're like
[02:16:33] he's like hey did you have to kill him you know did you have to die or did you you know
[02:16:40] you know he has a right to live and all this stuff for whatever and he's like yeah he's
[02:16:43] you'll did you use excessive force and all this he's like yeah he used everything I have
[02:16:47] and he's like hey you know like people are protected are protected you know entitled to
[02:16:52] protection by the law or whatever and he says so he grabs the recorder and unwraps or he
[02:16:59] uncovers like one of the bodies right and he's like you tell that to his family huh
[02:17:06] he passed the CNN test is what I'm saying yeah I think it was legal too though technically
[02:17:12] it depends on the situation it was like borderline so yeah I don't want to go into the movie
[02:17:17] what happened you know to kind of to get cobra off the hook or nothing like that but nonetheless
[02:17:22] that's the CNN test it seems like yeah no that so so the CNN test is but it's not a
[02:17:30] it's not a unilateral test that just because it passed I see it's okay that's what I'm
[02:17:37] trying to explain to young leaders it's not just the CNN test it's the CNN test
[02:17:42] plus it's the legal test is what you're doing legal or is it illegal and if it's illegal
[02:17:50] there are going to be repercussions even if you pass the CNN test so as a leader you've got to
[02:17:59] pay attention those things and what you have to do is keep your troops out of trouble that's
[02:18:03] incumbent upon you to keep your troops out of trouble because they they might be reacting emotionally
[02:18:14] and you're the one that's supposed to rain them in and make sure that they're not getting not
[02:18:16] not doing things that are illegal and I'm not saying those things are deserved you know you find
[02:18:24] somebody that just killed three Americans that that ISIS member deserves to die we get it
[02:18:29] not legal yeah not so out so where did these go and and my original point was like Franklin
[02:18:39] maybe to him it was he was quote unquote like I said maybe bending a few rules or
[02:18:44] returning a blind eye just just small minor things and the means kind of justified the end
[02:18:51] scenario and yeah I agree I think that's true or it's like well I remember we're
[02:18:56] slitting a girls throat yeah yeah fully we have to leaders have to lead their troops to make
[02:19:03] sure that they are not just doing the right thing that they're not just passing the CNN test
[02:19:08] but they're also doing what's legal otherwise there's going to be repercussions that's just
[02:19:13] that's just the way it is the seriality all right back to the book when I remember the
[02:19:24] folly of it all now I rationalize a bit and tell myself that there wasn't enough time to be
[02:19:29] fully sensitive to the finality of death for instance to say that it had not been a very
[02:19:35] important day because the second battalion had but two NVA kills now seems ludicrous it was a
[02:19:41] damn important day for those two dead men when even just one man died or got his fingers blown
[02:19:48] off for his legs shattered or is hearing impaired or his eyes bludded and blinded it was one hell
[02:19:53] of a costly battle especially if you happen to be the guy who got it that day it's something
[02:20:00] generals and presidents can never understand only mothers fathers brothers sons daughters and wives
[02:20:10] maybe if I were a general or a president who never went to war with his men or who never
[02:20:14] risked paying the same price maybe I'd want to convert the whole damn show into a statistical
[02:20:20] table to be read solemnly by some broadcaster every Thursday night generals and presidents are
[02:20:28] fine for explaining to all of us those things that we ought to be willing to die for but when the war
[02:20:35] is over all that's left our statistics and the generals and the presidents are always among the living
[02:20:45] if anything has happened to our country as a result of the Vietnam war it is that our
[02:20:50] national infection with the sickness of the numbers game we reduced the blood and the suffering
[02:20:56] and the death and destruction to mere ciphers and in doing so we reduced our own souls
[02:21:06] numbers don't die people do
[02:21:10] columns of figures don't disintegrate in the explosion of a bomb human beings do
[02:21:16] statistics don't bleed and if you make your war a war of numbers you will have no trouble sleeping
[02:21:27] most generals and presidents slept well
[02:21:29] so this stuff is continuing on in another mind boggling plot twist on April 2, 1969 Barnes
[02:21:52] gave me a letter of commendation from general counters who had replaced general peers as the
[02:21:57] commander of the first field force victor he also handed me a letter from peers which had come all the way
[02:22:02] from the states peers was quite complimentary and Barnes added that the second battalion was the
[02:22:08] best in the brigade and that I was the best battalion commander he had personally ever known so that's
[02:22:14] Franklin's boss then he handed me his own letter of commendation the score sheet for the brigade
[02:22:23] which again listed the second battalion as the top battalion and the official IG report which listed
[02:22:30] the second battalion as the tops in the brigade he also assured me that I would very soon begin
[02:22:37] reaping the awards rewards for my efforts as he called them he said the distinguished
[02:22:43] service cross was being prepared and the general already had a verbal assurance it would be approved
[02:22:50] he's getting some love I went back to the battalion and sat down with warm islas bourbon my god what was
[02:23:00] happening two months of nothing but crap and now all this in one day maybe things really were going
[02:23:06] to be different maybe the brigade was going to shape up with less than two and a half months to go
[02:23:10] sweetness and light were in the air and there were signs that everything was going to be okay
[02:23:15] but something else nodded me I had reported eight atrocities or war crimes or whatever the
[02:23:24] hell they wanted to call them the abuse of the detainees at on k the three torture incidents the
[02:23:31] murders the looting the alleged murder of a young lieutenant and the alleged execution of the
[02:23:37] detainee in the custody of the hero lieutenant if I could get those things cleared up I'd really be up
[02:23:43] to date and I knew I'd better get my statements down sooner or I'd have to get them in writing
[02:23:51] from back in the states taking time out of the command in general staff college at 11 worth
[02:23:55] and I didn't expect to have that kind of time so yeah this all comes really clear right now
[02:24:04] I went down on the morning of April 3rd so the next day to talk to Franklin about them
[02:24:08] Sir I jokingly said when I entered your best batying commander of yesterday would like to have
[02:24:13] a talk with you today okay sure Herbert come in he said have a seat I sat down where he
[02:24:21] indicated it was only it was the only chair in the room what's on your mind the eight allegations sir
[02:24:29] the atrocities I reported I want atrocities he interrupted what the hell are you talking about
[02:24:33] atrocities eight sir and I took them off one by one counting them on my fingers as I went sir
[02:24:39] I'm going home in less than two weeks and most of the other witnesses have already gone I'd
[02:24:44] like to get my part wound up now while I still have time and things are going kind of slow
[02:24:53] God damn it Tony said the investigations are ongoing what more can I do
[02:24:59] the next morning when I reported Barnes was behind his desk and Franklin was in the chair to his
[02:25:08] right it was quick Colonel Herbert the general said I'm going to replace you as the commander of second
[02:25:14] battalion I felt the blood drained from my head replace sir you mean relief not relief Tony replace
[02:25:21] I'm giving you a maximum efficiency report and sending you to Saigon hit me like a ton of rocks
[02:25:27] it is is it over the allegations I made sir Franklin leap to his feet screaming that's right you
[02:25:33] son of a bitch you and your goddamn lies about beach and crouched and all the rest that poor lieutenant
[02:25:38] and every other one of your damn lies and exaggerations so clearly they were buttering him up
[02:25:46] hey you've done great you're our best battalion we're got you we give you a maximum efficiency report
[02:25:52] like you're the best guy how about you just freaking keep the old mouth shut my allegations
[02:26:00] and then when he brings him up again they realize he's going to stick to his guns
[02:26:05] I felt cold and empty then a wave of relief swept over me in calm said and I stared at Franklin
[02:26:10] as though he were in insect and I tried to speak as deliberately and as cool as I could
[02:26:15] I'm not talking to you sir I'm trying to speak to my commander general Barnes
[02:26:19] it stopped Franklin's ranting and he gave me the chance to turn back to Barnes sir the very
[02:26:26] least you owe me is a complete investigation to see who really is telling the lies and exaggerating
[02:26:32] the general had his head down over his desk tripling on a piece of note paper
[02:26:36] Carl Franklin has already investigated all your charges and I'm satisfied he said reaching out and
[02:26:41] handing me the note you'll be out on the landing zone in one hour there are two planes leaving
[02:26:48] for side gone today you be on one of them your records will be ready for you an onk when you
[02:26:53] in side gone or onk when you get there you report to Colonel Lou Ashley in side gone it's on the note
[02:27:01] sir I said I have a battalion I've signed for over a million dollars with a material and
[02:27:05] an equipment I just can't clear out in an hour Franklin broken one hour herberg one hour you'll be
[02:27:11] picked up under arrest and taken out by the provost marshal one hour Barnes said again
[02:27:15] I saluted don't do many favors with the efficiency report I intend to see you all again
[02:27:24] so even though they said we're gonna let you out of here with a good evaluation he's saying don't even
[02:27:34] this dude does not play bro
[02:27:36] as I walk back to the battalion I told myself it was important to remain calm
[02:27:45] co-inclected I knew I had them both just as long as I didn't blow it they had gone far beyond
[02:27:51] their authority in removing me without any grounds for relief I was convinced by then
[02:27:55] that it had to be something more than any allegations of atrocities hell everybody knew about
[02:28:00] them anyways somebody else would be bringing them up again and soon if they thought that by
[02:28:05] getting rid of me they were also getting rid of the shame of what it occurred then they that they
[02:28:10] had got it under the rug they neither understood me nor the army at that point I still had faith in
[02:28:15] the system I walked over to the talk Ernie had most of the officers gathered in the briefing room
[02:28:21] he had already told them look I began there's no time to screw around you know I've been given the
[02:28:26] boot that's why I wanted to talk to you all right away I've only got about 15 minutes more before
[02:28:31] I have to get out of here but I wanted to take some time to thank you and get the chance to shake as many
[02:28:36] of your hands that could before I have to go there were some protests and a few remarks about quitting
[02:28:42] I stifled that quickly the army has a system of military justice and rules and rags so none of
[02:28:47] you need to go off half cocked and try and take things into your own hands nobody quit see there
[02:28:52] just keep thinking about the battalion that's what's important not me if you're if you
[02:28:57] quit you're letting down not only me but every last one of those grunts out here they have to stay
[02:29:02] they can't quit you can but many of them need you and the guy who replaces me is going to need you
[02:29:08] it's not going to be his fault what happened to me so stick with the battalion and stick with him and
[02:29:12] stick with them I said waving toward the booties I started shaking hands in the in the landing zone
[02:29:21] area men all along the ground were lined up pulling off smoke canisters of every color in the rainbow
[02:29:28] there were maybe a hundred men out there and a hundred smokes it was their honors smoke
[02:29:33] when the troops were coming back after a kill they buzzed the field with a smoke on each skid
[02:29:39] and when one of their own left they lit one to five depending on how well he was like
[02:29:44] light plus his reputation as a fighter and I was looking down on at least a hundred of them knowing
[02:29:52] all the time that nobody was that good but choked up with appreciation nevertheless
[02:29:58] I waved and they waved back the pilot bank the ship again and I sat against the wall rigging
[02:30:05] and wiped my eyes
[02:30:07] we landed in Saigon a bit before nine o'clock that evening and although I shouldn't have
[02:30:16] been feeling like a bastard on father's day I didn't although I should have been feeling
[02:30:20] like a bastard on father's day I didn't I was relieved in more ways than one I suppose I
[02:30:25] reasoned that if Barnes and Franklin had hated me that much I was better off out of the outfit
[02:30:31] I had the marbles in my pocket they had nothing to fall back on but their own lies and false
[02:30:36] effications I knew I had been lucky I could have had accidental kills of women and children or other
[02:30:42] non-combatants and they would have had me had the marbles in their pockets I could have ranked second
[02:30:47] or third on the IG inspection I could have had a high court martial rate or accident rate or
[02:30:52] large number of article 15s or delinquencies reports from the military police or any one of a number
[02:30:58] of other things that could have been used against me but I've been lucky frankly I'm used I had
[02:31:04] let Franklin I'm used had let his personal dislike for me get the best of him it had forced him
[02:31:11] into a premature confrontation that I was bound to win I was bound to win well
[02:31:26] it was not that clear cut it was not that clear cut at all and the book goes on and it goes into
[02:31:39] a lot of detail and there are all kinds of further accusations and counter accusations and they end up
[02:31:52] making sworn statements against Herbert including him leading the killing of civilians so they
[02:32:01] start making accusations against him and this is and again these documents are in this book that's
[02:32:09] one of the things that makes this book so good is it's got all this actual documentation here they
[02:32:14] they recommend revoking disorders they recommend removing his opportunity to to lead or being
[02:32:21] command again general rust who's the overall decision maker on the case agrees with the accusatory
[02:32:29] statements kills Colonel Herbert's career so the idea that he was bound to win no actually doesn't
[02:32:38] work out that way Colonel Herbert fights it he fights this spends a bunch of his own money
[02:32:44] and then he goes on the offense because he won in investigations before now he goes on the offense
[02:32:54] charges uh brings charges up against Colonel Franklin 14 separate specifications including
[02:33:01] failure to report murders and church torture he does the same thing to general barns fail up failure
[02:33:08] to report war crimes on multiplications so he's going on the offense it gets national publicity it's in the
[02:33:15] news the lead investigator for the army this guy by the name of major Carl Hensley
[02:33:26] according to the book and I hate to say that I'm just because I don't know what I don't know
[02:33:32] what the truth is according to the book this guy major Carl Hensley had told Herbert like look we
[02:33:37] believe you you're right we can win this thing and then he kills himself kills himself with a
[02:33:44] shotgun you can you can look that one up it's in a New York Times press briefing major Carl Hensley
[02:33:51] suicide ends up all the charges are eventually dropped against both barns and Franklin
[02:34:01] Colonel Franklin eventually relieved from his command for throwing a Vietnamese body out of
[02:34:11] a helicopter in Vietnam and again this guy was the most decorated from what I could find in
[02:34:19] research most decorated officer from his West Point class 1950 1991 by the way Colonel Franklin
[02:34:27] convicted and spent five years in prison for us securities scheme scam swindled about $100 people out
[02:34:36] a million dollars so there's like you know you see these questionable characters characteristics
[02:34:48] so all the charges so imagine us all the charges against barns and Franklin get dropped
[02:34:53] but Herbert is not charged with making a single fall statement so all these things that he had said
[02:35:02] he never gets charged for making a fall statement but the charges get dropped
[02:35:09] he goes kind of public does a bunch of interviews eventually he's retired or he retires
[02:35:16] you know he's done with the army he gets eventually he gets interviewed on 60 minutes by Mike Wallace
[02:35:27] and this is freaking crazy so they have and I've tried to find this him been able to find it
[02:35:34] but I read about it they have Herbert getting interviewed by Mike Wallace he kind of tells his story
[02:35:41] and then out of the other room they bring major grim shot who was part of the unit who comes out and says yeah look
[02:35:49] I worked for Herbert I know Herbert I respect Herbert but what he said isn't true
[02:35:57] so so now who he's supposed to believe so Herbert sues Mike Wallace in 60 minutes for libel
[02:36:07] it's a 13 year court case it's a 13 year court case eventually gets all the way to supreme court
[02:36:18] and Herbert loses the case Herbert eventually he became a clinical psychologist and also police
[02:36:29] psychologists dies of cancer June 7th 2014
[02:36:46] just the the whole thing is a travesty and I guess the best thing we can do is
[02:36:57] what can we learn from it what can we learn from it I would say the obvious lesson here is
[02:37:08] put your ego aside and build relationships with people now you might say well these people
[02:37:16] were doing wrong okay so what what good do you do when you just build form an antagonist
[02:37:22] relation could you have more influence over them or less influence over them you have less
[02:37:30] so if you can build a relationship with people now listen this is again this is some freaking
[02:37:35] hard this is what makes leadership part if these if there's people that are doing things that are
[02:37:38] moral illegal and ethical okay what are you going to do you can do what Herbert did stand up to
[02:37:44] him and guess what he gets fired now he has no influence over the situation
[02:37:47] because if you think like you have to stop that that's my moral obligation to stop this
[02:37:54] stuff from happening was did Colonel Herbert stop from happening no he said he's gone he has no
[02:38:02] more influence who took over his baton some yes man when a Colonel Franklin's you know boys
[02:38:09] that came in and started telling the party line so freaking disaster it's just a disaster you get
[02:38:27] you get the high ground great you got the high ground and then you and then you
[02:38:30] look down on people and you get an antagonistic relationship with him yeah and there's all
[02:38:43] all the stuff is documented you got to read the book and I'm sure we could have more
[02:38:48] discussions maybe we will maybe we'll bring some maybe we'll find somebody that was there
[02:38:52] that knows more about it and now let's look there's two sides to every story too I mean you
[02:38:58] are you pointed out you know what are they just trying to get the job done
[02:39:04] is he was he exaggerating some of this I don't know I don't know my original take
[02:39:15] was that this guy is like a hack my original information that I got was this guy was a
[02:39:21] hack worth type individual from that was from from Colonel how his Herbert had worked for his
[02:39:34] grandfather right so this is like a close to getting right now that we can go off of I don't know
[02:39:41] I don't know I know that leadership is a freaking challenge I know that
[02:39:47] and this book proves it
[02:40:00] hate this feeling echo Charles the kind of empty feeling yeah sure don't like it yeah and so
[02:40:09] I don't like when I can't really identify the truth I can't like it yeah and that's kind of why
[02:40:16] I did think about that we're thinking about the other people's perspective you know
[02:40:24] and with that kind of you kind of think like how did how did let's say that the guys like all
[02:40:29] wrong like because let's face according to the story kind of sounds like they're almost like
[02:40:34] corrupt almost where they're like hey who cares you know kind of thing so it's like what
[02:40:41] was the what we just have a straight up corrupt military is that what you saying like in that little
[02:40:50] but it's horrible for us to think that this entire division or this entire brigade at a minimum
[02:40:58] was corrupt yeah and that's what I'm thinking but the reality is like so these aren't like bad people
[02:41:07] like most people aren't just bad people who are just like destined for corruption or whatever
[02:41:11] it's almost like you kind of got to consider how did they get there why is it like that it's not
[02:41:16] because they're just these evil people who finally got there position of power and now can just
[02:41:20] exploit weakness and nothing like that but you take and you put all these factors in place like
[02:41:25] the fact that hey if you go do this tour you're going to get promoted you're going to get more money
[02:41:30] you're you got to go do this and when you get over there well what's the best way to get a good
[02:41:33] evaluation you get a good evaluation by doing whatever else is doing late you know you don't want to
[02:41:38] stick your head up and be the one that gets draws a bunch of attention so if that's what we're doing
[02:41:42] you know it's an expression that you use you use this expression that's what we're doing you know
[02:41:49] like you'll say oh that's I thought that's just what we were doing yeah you use that expression sometimes
[02:41:54] well that's a normal thing for people to feel look that's what we're doing okay that's what's
[02:41:59] everyone else is doing I'm on okay yeah if we're gonna let the Vietnamese kind of run and do
[02:42:05] whatever they want if that's what we're doing cool I don't want to be the one that's drawn a bunch
[02:42:08] of attention myself they know about me so I'm just going to kind of sit back and let it happen yeah
[02:42:13] so people getting that mode and you lose vision here's the other thing I can't much confidence
[02:42:20] do you have in yourself to say like hey everyone here is wrong everyone here that's letting this
[02:42:26] happen as wrong you know how do you not feel like wait a second there's you know a brigade of
[02:42:31] 5,000 people here and everyone's kind of down with what's happening and I'm the person that's not
[02:42:37] there's something wrong here maybe it's wrong maybe there's something wrong with me yeah
[02:42:43] and you get the momentum and the inertia of you get the inertia of hey hey we're going to get a new
[02:42:52] Italian commander soon enough don't worry about this guy we got he's going to be going to do
[02:42:55] here for six months what what are we trying to do make money right we can run these little scams and
[02:43:01] make some money we we just want to have the time pass so I can move on I can just be done with my
[02:43:07] job trust me that's that's a real thing even in today's military like have you ever heard
[02:43:13] does zero defect zero defect model where it's like oh yeah we're gonna promote someone that has
[02:43:19] had no mistakes so if you're over on deployment if you're an Iraq or you're an Afghanistan
[02:43:24] and you want to get promoted and there's a mission to go do and you get to decide whether you
[02:43:32] go do that mission or not do you think you should do it or not oh yeah got it yeah so if you don't
[02:43:39] basically if you don't take that much action you don't want make that mean mistakes right
[02:43:44] on you can have the zero defect record you have the zero defect record I went on deployment I did
[02:43:50] four missions they all went well get a bronze star go home get a good evaluation and we're good to go
[02:44:00] or I'm gonna go over there I'm gonna do a hundred missions every single one of those missions is
[02:44:05] a freaking challenge and by the way if you're doing four missions you can kind of hand pick
[02:44:09] like if you do 10 missions you do 20 missions you're hand pick okay this one's not bad not about
[02:44:15] area we've got really good intel looks good all right go look go ahead and execute this one
[02:44:19] all right if you're gonna do a hundred missions you're going okay look this one's a little bit more
[02:44:25] high risk but we're gonna go it seems like a well-making impact will go executed there's a tendency
[02:44:31] well not a tendency there's a possibility that you say you know what look I don't want to have
[02:44:36] everyone get hurt I don't want to have any bad you know I don't have any negatives on my evaluation
[02:44:42] I just want to get my job done to move on you know I want to punch the ticket so you end up doing
[02:44:47] 14 missions and you did your job good for you and now you get your ticket punched and you go home
[02:44:54] and everyone's good and by the way when you get home because it was get rid of everyone says hey
[02:44:59] he did it he was a he was a company commander he was a baton commander he did it you know he's a combat
[02:45:05] experienced veteran as he said right so now are you kind of on a pedestal a little bit yeah
[02:45:09] even though you really don't know anything so what I'm saying is the system even more so
[02:45:14] in Vietnam was all set up where hey get over there keep your mouth shut go with the flow
[02:45:21] fitting with the crew yeah and that's why hack worth had such a freaking issue with it and so did
[02:45:26] herber makes sense so almost like they should maybe think about and I'm saying this with
[02:45:33] complete ignorance by the way but they should change the little system to be you know like diving
[02:45:38] you're much diving like I don't know Olympics or whatever diving right like platform whatever they have
[02:45:44] they have a discord and the difficulty level exactly right so you get a score for difficulty level
[02:45:50] and if the difficulty level is low you're not gonna get a high score you know yeah it's true and that's
[02:45:56] fine again the system is really it's very easy for the system to fall back into a zero defect
[02:46:05] mentality a risk of vers mentality because look I could go on to point it tomorrow and circumstances
[02:46:12] could be that there's just not a lot going on and so we did four missions not because we want
[02:46:17] aggressive but because there wasn't that many missions to do and so I'd come back and you can't look
[02:46:23] down on me you can't say well joccal when we did four missions I did all the ones that I could
[02:46:26] I was aggressive as I could possibly be we only did four you go on deployment there's you could
[02:46:31] do a hundred missions but you only do four you come back sad as many as jocca were good to go and
[02:46:37] I'm a overall leader I wasn't there so I'm looking at go hey I go did four jocquitted four hey
[02:46:43] these guys are equivalent we're good to go move on meanwhile you were super risk of earth didn't
[02:46:46] take any chances really didn't impact their battlefield and you're gonna get the same recognition
[02:46:51] so it's a very difficult thing to do it's a very difficult thing then you can see you can see
[02:46:56] that Vietnam just got so wrapped up in this this careerism of hey go do your time keep your mouth shut
[02:47:03] getting you know go with the flow and that's that what are the missions that we're doing okay we're doing
[02:47:09] that kind of mission cool oh got it we got guys smoking pot no one really seems to notice that
[02:47:15] oh we're getting smoke and pot like it's just bad across the board and a lot of it has to do with what
[02:47:22] is our mission what is our mission why what what what what means we want what means we want
[02:47:29] if you don't even know what means you want how are you gonna you know if you went on a football field
[02:47:33] and you didn't know what how if you didn't know how to score a goal what would you do
[02:47:39] what would you do you wouldn't be able to do anything you wouldn't but as long as you know
[02:47:42] hey here's where you're trying to get to okay got it give me that ball moving to foot down the
[02:47:46] field I'm moving to yard down the field I'm moving and inch down the field you're at least
[02:47:49] know which direction you're moving it if you get told hey go out on that field you know when
[02:47:53] tells you where the end zone is right no no one tells you so what are you gonna do so as a leader
[02:48:03] you gotta take that into account you gotta make sure people know what the mission is you gotta know what
[02:48:06] the strategy is when you better know why you're going to war and you better make that perfectly
[02:48:17] clear when you're going check empty feeling sorry don't like it all right so what else can we do
[02:48:34] this is just a freaking well speaking of empty feelings I have one two three cans of empty
[02:48:42] two and a half cans of empty just plain go some of the take this opportunity to tell our people
[02:48:49] what does plain go is I'm glad because I'm just I had some two but I still feel I'm still so empty
[02:48:55] alright hey it's all good well okay I won't start with discipline go how about that we'll just
[02:49:00] talk about jockel fuel in general okay look we're on the path we're learning stuff lessons hard
[02:49:05] any easy by the way obviously well you know how they say like there's hard lessons like the
[02:49:16] hard lessons are the ones that are learned like the best yes true he who suffers remembers
[02:49:22] yeah yeah so boom so we're on the path right we're looking for lessons we're learning from lessons
[02:49:29] learning from lessons from others that's one of those efficiency things yeah there's some great
[02:49:35] leadership lessons in the both these books that's for sure like some read like that thing about
[02:49:39] planning if you let your team come up with a plan they're invested they have a material interest in
[02:49:44] seeing the plants succeed that right there's gold read those books look you come away feeling empty
[02:49:49] like I did let me fill in that whole little bit there I just did I just filled in my own hole in my
[02:49:54] heart for getting to the end of this book by saying hey if you let your team come up with a plan
[02:49:59] if they have a material interest in making the plan succeed there you go I feel better already
[02:50:04] me too so yes the last one the path and through that path a lot of people know about the path
[02:50:13] they don't walk the path I saw that meme today since I'm in my head but when we when we do walk the path
[02:50:21] we may need assistance assistance through whether it be mentorship guidance or supplementation
[02:50:28] yeah it's for supplementation goes we have jockel fuel so we got stuff for joints we got stuff for protein we
[02:50:35] got stuff for a brain and we got stuff for immunity that's it right more or less or I'm just getting
[02:50:44] stronger with the moke yes that's the protein that's the original product oh yeah so and here's the
[02:50:50] thing thank you to about something else I understand for here's the thing here's the formula for
[02:50:55] getting strong could you tell I was like not with you yeah okay I'm just making sure I'm very used to that
[02:51:02] dynamic you usually I'm paying attention well depends on what you mean by usually but true
[02:51:09] anyway the formula for getting strong that if you've sensed that for me it should be a non-verbal
[02:51:16] cue to talk fast and kind of rap yeah I thought that in the beginning but now you don't care
[02:51:21] there while yeah it's just what I don't care I'm very used to you have no material interested moving
[02:51:26] it's gonna be a long which is fine I'm a material interest but it's very small nonetheless okay
[02:51:33] the material formula for being strong is three things the correct exercise the correct
[02:51:43] rest in recovery and the correct fuel nutrition slash fuel slash food if you'll ever yeah moke
[02:51:52] is part of that last part the fuel forgetting strong seem saying so yeah moke will make you
[02:51:57] strong as long as those other two things are in places well sure anyway go to jockelfuel.com for all
[02:52:02] these things score score some supplementation for this path that we are walking not just knowing
