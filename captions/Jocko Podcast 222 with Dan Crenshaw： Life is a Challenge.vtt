00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 22 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Someone called for my Afghan interpreter, Rockman. A good man with whom we had worked with for some time.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These interpreters are the unsung heroes of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
They often suffer threats and ostracism for their willingness to endure the battlefield alongside us.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Their motivation isn't money. There's enough money to make it worthwhile facing down in surgeons who know where you and your family live.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They are idealists. They work and risk death because they believe in our common cause of freedom.

7
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Rockman responded to the call immediately. Running before me, his foot fell in a particular spot just to feet away from where I stood.

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I was looking right at him.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As I later discovered, he instantly lost all his limbs in the explosion.

10
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Even though I was staring right at him, I never actually saw it happen. My experience was a series of tremendous blows and subsequent realizations.

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
A train hit me. Ears ringing. What the fuck was that?

12
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Darkness. Something is wrong. Got hit. My legs reached out and see if they're still there. They're there. I feel them.

13
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm saying everywhere. Mostly my abdomen. Something shot through it. I think my eyes must be kicked with mud. I can barely see anything.

14
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I hear groaning and screaming. Someone hit an IED. Pain everywhere. But my eyes.

15
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I crawl around a little bit. Mostly to see if my body still functions. My teammates make their way to me.

16
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I ask someone to pour water on my eyes to remove the dirt so I can see that doesn't work.

17
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I can only see light and some shapes must be a lot of dirt. I recognize my corpsman's voice as he works on my wounds.

18
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I say, dude, don't get blown up. It sucks. He laughs and tells me to shut up.

19
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was conscious throughout. Our corpsman stopped my bleeding. The worst of which was from my knees and wrapped up my eyes.

20
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It still did not occur to me that there was anything wrong with them. I could only hear the situation around me.

21
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
My teammates calling to each other, communicating the situation with tense voices.

22
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I later found out that a foot wearing the typical Solomon boot that we all wore hit one of my teammates in the chest about 50 yards away.

23
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Rockman was groaning in pain. Deep, deep pain.

24
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Most people's experience of combat wounds is from the movies. The soldier gets hit. His gut spilling out and he looks down at them screaming in horror.

25
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But this is not the way it is. In reality, truly bad injuries, sap your energy and prevent you from screaming.

26
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Instead, the sound of wounded man makes is a much deeper, more visceral emanating from the depths of his being.

27
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It's a grown, a cry, a moaning that wreaks of utter desperation.

28
00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It is far worse than a scream. It is true pain manifested in the sound.

29
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This was the sound that Rockman made. It is unforgettable.

30
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
As the corn intended to me and we waited for the MetaVac helicopter, a fought entered my head.

31
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We may be in a firefight any second now. Rockman was barely alive and he would later die in the hospital.

32
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Our EOD chief petty officer took a little frag also and would be evacuated with us. All hands were needed to fight.

33
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I could hear the MetaVac helo coming in low. This was no time to ask someone to carry me.

34
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Blow up and blind. I stood up and walked myself to it.

35
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Dave Worson, who would be killed two months later, heroically laid down cover fire for me as I boarded the helo.

36
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It was my last memory of him.

37
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
MetaVac's on board the helo copter took one look at me, laid me down and eased me into unconsciousness.

38
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I woke up days later, far away from Hellman, far away from Candeharr, far away from my brothers and arms, far away from the war and dust of Central Asia.

39
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I was brought back into consciousness in Germany at the American Hospital Longstool.

40
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
A breathing tube was being unceremoniously ripped from my throat, rather unpleasant.

41
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I opened my eyes or thought I did and saw nothing.

42
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
A physician came to me and told me the truth. My right eye was gone.

43
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
My left eye was so heavily damaged that there was virtually no chance I would see with it again.

44
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
My future was a future of blindness, of darkness, of no sight, no color, no visual beauty.

45
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I would never see a sunset, a friend, a loved one again.

46
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:23.000
In one instant, in a fatal footfall, all that was ripped away.

47
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And that right there was an excerpt from a book called Fortitude, written by Dan Krenchall,

48
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
who was a former seal officer and he's actually been on this podcast before number 118.

49
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And the last time he was on, he was in the process of running for Congress.

50
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Well, he won and is currently a congressman serving the second congressional district of Texas,

51
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and the House of Representatives, and well, it's an honor to have Dan back with us today

52
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to share some of the lessons learned that he talks about in his new book.

53
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And once again, the name of the book is Fortitude. Dan.

54
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Thanks for coming back, Dan.

55
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Thank you for having me.

56
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Listen to you read that.

57
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Maybe I should have asked you to read my book for the audio version.

58
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That was good.

59
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Well, thanks.

60
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's only good because the story that's being told is obviously a very powerful one.

61
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And you know, you sent me this book.

62
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And as soon as you sent it to me, I started talking to you about, let's get you back on the podcast.

63
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Obviously you're busy man.

64
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Obviously you're busy man right now for reference.

65
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It is, what is it?

66
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's March of 2020 in the midst of the pandemic.

67
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The coronavirus pandemic is going on around the world and around America.

68
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There's schools and again, who knows what this will look like,

69
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
looking back on it when people are listening to this in the future.

70
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Whether if they're listening to it a month from now, a week from now or years from now,

71
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
it'll be interesting what this pandemic turned out to be.

72
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But you braved the travel.

73
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We did.

74
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We did.

75
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And we just, you know, I'm leaving off the heels of that late night vote again for,

76
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
for listeners trying to put this in context and what you saw in the news.

77
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Leaving off the heels of that late night vote where,

78
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
where, which was for the economic stimulus that the president supported

79
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and bipartisan in nature, different from the eight billion plus dollars that we voted on a week prior,

80
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which was meant to combat it on a public health scale.

81
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So, you know, I, I, the, it's,

82
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
everybody agrees.

83
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I think we've, as a country and as a government, we have taken this particular pandemic more seriously than anything in the past.

84
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
More than we did for Ebola, for H1N1.

85
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And I've asked that specific questions to folks like the Assistant Surgeon General Admiral Red,

86
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
who, who, who, who worked all of these pandemics.

87
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And so, I just hope people realize that that's not what you hear from the media.

88
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You know, the media would tell you that it's totally unprepared.

89
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And, you know, you're never going to be perfectly prepared.

90
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I think that's a lesson, you and I know pretty well.

91
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
But you learn those lessons and you do better the next time.

92
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The finger pointing has been completely unnecessary, mostly dishonest and totally unhelpful.

93
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But the government has been taken it pretty seriously and we're definitely taking it seriously in Congress.

94
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Well, I'm glad you were able to get out here.

95
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And again, I think there's no telling what this will look like in hindsight.

96
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But it's quiet around here in San Diego right now.

97
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
There's just not a lot of people doing a lot of stuff. Obviously we're in the gym and the gym,

98
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
you know, not a lot of ton of people coming into the gym right now.

99
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
There's still people training though.

100
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Don't worry, we're training that you did, too.

101
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
But yeah, you sent me the book and, you know, cracked it open, started reading it and immediately was just, you know, getting in touch with you to see if we could get you out here.

102
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
On the podcast to talk about it and man, you know, the stuff that you've been through and the lessons that you've taken away from it are very powerful.

103
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And you know, that's one of the things that struck me out of the gate is that when you got wounded, you actually, you actually do strength from very powerful place and things that you've been through.

104
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And I want to jump in and read some more of this, some more of this things that you've been through.

105
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And I think a lot of people are going to be able to take a lot of away from it.

106
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So I'm going back to the book.

107
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
This is after you wounded.

108
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I fought back to another time in my life two decades earlier.

109
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
The first time I ever witnessed the kind of inescapable pain that I was feeling now and the grit to overcome it was with my mother.

110
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
She fought a battle so many other modern women fight breast cancer.

111
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And she did so with endurance, grace and optimism.

112
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Her example is never left me and it wasn't about to let some cheap ass ID in the ancient killing fields of Afghanistan render me unworthy of her memory.

113
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
She was only 35 years old when she was diagnosed.

114
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Same age as me as I write these words.

115
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
When she got the news, it was one day before my little brothers first birthday.

116
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I was five years old.

117
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
The doctors told her she might have five years to live.

118
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And they were right.

119
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Soon after she would be feeling the pain I was feeling now as the cancer and chemotherapy ripped apart her body in battle.

120
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
She fought it for five years.

121
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And when I was 10, she died.

122
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:16.000
If you've ever cared for loved one in terminal decline, you know what that's like.

123
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
There is an intensity of loss that is immeasurable.

124
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Words don't do it justice.

125
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The whole deep down in your gut feels like it will never go away.

126
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
As a child, the intensity of the experience is made worse as grief is amplified by in comprehension.

127
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Going from kindergarten to fourth grade, knowing that your mother is dying.

128
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
That the center of a small boy's world is collapsing is an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone.

129
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
But from this grief came learning.

130
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I got to experience the nature of a true hero.

131
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And the example she set was the most powerful fortifying and selfless thing I have ever seen, including combat.

132
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Buying helpless and a hospital bed, I had to wonder whether my mother had asked the same desperate question I was currently asking.

133
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
What I ever seen, my family again.

134
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I figured that as she could suffer through that question and the unknowable answer, so could I.

135
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
My mother spent half a decade staring death in the face, burned with caring for two small boys whom she would not live to see grow up.

136
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
She lived day to day in ever increasing pain, the cancer afflicted her.

137
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And the cancer treatments afflicted her too.

138
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Six rounds of chemotherapy on top of radiation treatments are a brutal experience for even the strongest constitution.

139
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Self pity is never a useful state.

140
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But if anyone had reason to feel sorry for herself and had to complain a bit, it was my mom.

141
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But she never did.

142
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
In terminal decline and in pain across five years, I never heard her complain once.

143
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I never heard her bemoan her fate.

144
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I never saw her express self pity.

145
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Every day she woke up was a day she was still alive and she lived.

146
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
She was dying and she was grateful to not be dead yet.

147
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Every extra day was a gift where she could look her boys in the face.

148
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Every next evening was another night she could tell us she loved us before bed.

149
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Even during her last days when the hospital delivered her death bed and hospice nurse to our dining room.

150
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Her demeanor did not change.

151
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Susan Carroll Crenshaw was exactly the opposite of what she had every right to be.

152
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
She was a very good person.

153
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
She was a very good person.

154
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Yeah, yeah, it was more for my mom than for me.

155
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000
You know, I tell that story because the name of that chapter is perspective from darkness.

156
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And perspective, I think is something we lack in our modern day society.

157
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We are, I think, too many people are willing to jump to this false conclusion that you've had at the worst that your life is worse than your ancestors or than your peers or than anybody else walking around America right now.

158
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And there's just a really, just so happens, there's a really good chance that's not true.

159
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I'm not saying it's not true.

160
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm just saying there's a pretty good chance it's probably not true.

161
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It's interesting, too.

162
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Well, I always talk about perspective from a leadership perspective, which means, hey, if I'm looking at one of my troops,

163
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
the better I understand their perspective on what I'm telling them and what their job is and what the mission is,

164
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the better I'm going to be able to lead them.

165
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And same thing with my boss.

166
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
The better I understand my boss's perspective and what the strategy look like and what's the overall thing he's trying to get accomplished.

167
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
The better I understand his perspective, the better I'm going to be able to lead.

168
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And it's interesting because when you put that across society, you would think that in today's day and age with the, with social media, with the ability to absorb so many other people's perspectives,

169
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:36.000
you'd think that that would open up your mind to realize that there's, you know, a lot of other people that have been through much worse than anything.

170
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I've even been close to gone through.

171
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yeah.

172
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And yet it doesn't seem to be happening that way.

173
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
No.

174
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
One of the most popular stories for an American to hear is a story of overcoming adversity.

175
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And that's a good thing.

176
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I'm glad those are still the stories that are the most popular in the American psyche.

177
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
You know, that a movie about somebody who's down-trodden and overcomes it is still a good movie.

178
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But there is, it's undeniable that there is this fragility that is infecting America.

179
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And that's why I wrote this book.

180
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And it's, you know, it's not a political book, it's not a seal book, it's not a, it's a cultural book.

181
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It's a cultural philosophy book and it's, it's simultaneously an individual kind of self-help book.

182
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And just how to be mentally tougher in your own individual life.

183
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
But there are much broader cultural implications that are strewn throughout the book.

184
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
It is a, it is a culture book.

185
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And because I fear that we are getting more sensitive, more prone to microaggressions and prone to saying how offended you are and

186
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
wearing, wearing that offense on your sleeve, proudly.

187
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And, and this gets to the, I think, what's the next chapter, which is who is your hero?

188
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And we've changed what we look up to.

189
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Like we think that it's good to, to scream about how offended we are.

190
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Like that's become like a monochrome, a good thing.

191
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
You know what's interesting, as, as, you know, before we start recording, you know,

192
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
we're just talking about kind of life in the games.

193
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And, uh, if there's one thing that you never do in the teams, ever, is show anyone that you're offended by anything that you're saying to you because if you allow that to happen,

194
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
you know, you're just going to get torn apart.

195
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Whereas it seems like, and I hadn't thought about from that perspective, the, the, all the rage in the public right now is if you can possibly get offended by something, then it's your, your, your, your,

196
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
your the best thing in the world, if you jump up and down and point to the person that offended you and why you were offended and,

197
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and the more offended you are the better off.

198
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:56.000
The agree of a to victim status is supreme these days, and that's a, and that's more of a serious problem than then I think most Americans are giving it credit for it.

199
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It's a really bad thing because you're changing, you're changing our heroes and, and when I say heroes, I want to, I want to be more specific because then I outlined this in the book and greater detail.

200
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I don't mean like, Jaco is my hero.

201
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Actually, and I personally when people ask me about who I look up to and my heroes, I, I will tell them attributes of people that I think are respectable.

202
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I don't think you should have one person that you look up to and I don't think that's totally healthy and that's not what I'm talking about on the book.

203
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I'm talking about hero archetypes.

204
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You know, and an archetype is a, is a, is a broader set of ideas or attributes that we sort of, that we sort of recognize collectively.

205
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Okay, so it's more of a psychological term than anything else.

206
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And there are certain hero archetypes, you know, like, maybe seals have a hero archetype.

207
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
We write about that in our, in our seal ethos.

208
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
It's such a beautifully written ethos and I, and I, I have the entire thing written in the book because it perfectly demonstrates what we believe we should be.

209
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Now what we should do, but what we should be, and that's a really interesting thing, and I, and I, and I note that,

210
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
you, you look at a, like, a corporate ethos, and if you go to people like corporations websites and you read them,

211
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
they're, they're usually something like, we want to be the number one manufacturer on the West Coast.

212
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It's like, that's not who you want to be.

213
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
That's just something you want to do.

214
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
If you, if you write out an ethos of who you want to be, you can, you can reach that level of elitism.

215
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You can surpass mediocrity.

216
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So that's important. That's important thing is here's that we have societal hero archetypes that we look up to.

217
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Jesus is a, is a hero archetype.

218
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Superman is a hero archetype.

219
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Real characters, too. You know, I put, I, I, I, I could name a thousand, you know, Rosa Parks, Ronald Reagan.

220
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
All of these people embody certain attributes that the American people think this is good.

221
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Okay. And we did generally agree on these things.

222
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I tell a whole story in the book about, when I was at Disney World, or was it Disney World?

223
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And I, I was at the Star Wars land.

224
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And I was watching this really cool thing happen where they, where they let these kids do Jedi training.

225
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Mm-hmm.

226
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And of course, like in, in typical Disney fashion, everything is really well run.

227
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
The actors are absolutely amazing.

228
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And they're teaching these kids, you know, how to work their swords and all that.

229
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
But they're also teaching them really cool things like the, just little Jedi lessons.

230
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Like, like, will you let your emotions be driven by hate and anger?

231
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
You know, like really simple lessons, because we look up to the Jedi as like a hero archetype.

232
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And so there are certain things that are just viewed as good.

233
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
But that's changing.

234
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And I, and I find that to be an extremely dangerous thing, because we're elevating the,

235
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the, a grieved victim, the person who talks about being offended the most and who screams the loudest,

236
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
elevating that person to a higher level in our society.

237
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And that's dangerous.

238
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
You're, you're flipping cultural norms on their head.

239
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And you do that at your own peril, you know, and, you know, cultural foundations based in thousands of years of trial and error and wisdom.

240
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Those are important.

241
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
They're more important than people realize.

242
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And like, that's, that's, that's frankly what the first,

243
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I guess, with that, that particular chapter is about perspectives chapter.

244
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
You know, they're all related, of course.

245
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
But the perspective's chapter and the reason I bring up my mom and the reason I tell that story.

246
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And then subsequent stories of other guys that we've lost is because you, you,

247
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
you need to, it's healthy to go through life thinking, you know, what somebody has had it harder than me.

248
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And I'd like to live up to their memory.

249
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I'd like to live up to that hero attribute, the hero, or the hero archetype of my mother.

250
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And I'm not lying. She never complained. She just, she never did.

251
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And if she did, I didn't hear it as a kid.

252
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And so, when you're living in blindness and not sure whether you will see again,

253
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
it's healthy to have that in your head.

254
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And I'm, you know, I say, you don't have to, you don't have to experience a bomb in your face to get some perspective.

255
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
But you can read about it. And it's like you said earlier, in a world where we're so connected and we can see everybody else's story of hardship,

256
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
you would think that we would have more perspective.

257
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But it seems that the opposite is true.

258
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And for, for step to reversing that trend, I think, is to at least realize it.

259
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Yeah, we, we recently had on, um,

260
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:47.000
rose-sindler who was, um, Auschwitz survivor. And I got many, many, many, um, messages and comments coming back saying, yeah, I'll put myself in check, you know, I, I don't have it that bad.

261
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Um, so that, and you know, we've had many people on here that have been through some really hellacious things,

262
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
whether it's prison or war camps, some just devastating situations.

263
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And it is, it's, it's, it's, it, if they weren't here and here, I, I get the feeling sometimes that if people weren't hearing it here, they wouldn't be hearing it.

264
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:17.000
They wouldn't be hearing it, you know, they'd just be thinking that everyone is living better than they are and they're the ones that are in the worst possible situation in the world.

265
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:27.000
We've got, yeah, and that's a, you know, I don't know, to, to get too much to politics, but it is, it is, it is one reason that we, that we have lurched into this conversation

266
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
about socialism because fundamentally socialism is, is an ideology that pits people against each other.

267
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
You have to believe that somebody else is oppressing you and that they have a better than you for you to embrace socialism.

268
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000
It is, it is, it is, it is the ultimate sin manifested into a political ideology, not the ultimate sin, but it's one of them.

269
00:24:47.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And that's, I was, I was looking for the deeper reason as to why something is happening. And it is natural for, for people to want to believe that something outside their own power is affecting their lives.

270
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Because if it's you, if it's your fault, if it's you who has to step up, that's harder, it's much easier to believe that there's something else.

271
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000
It also isn't a salt on your ego when you look at yourself and you say, well, I guess I'm the one that messed this up.

272
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Yeah, it is, and that's a devastating psychological consequence when your ego is hurt that way.

273
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
It is.

274
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Yeah, I wrote a book about that called Extreme Ownership.

275
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Which is a good book.

276
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Again, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, you wrote this book as, you know, as you're saying like a cultural philosophy, you know,

277
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:49.000
like, life and I wrote Extreme Ownership as, oh, as leadership principles, but I mean it didn't take, but two seconds for everyone to say, oh yeah, what you're talking about is, you know,

278
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000
easily transforms into a, into a cultural philosophy of taking ownership and responsibility for what's going on in your world.

279
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Absolutely, there's no doubt about it.

280
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And you find yourself in the lot in light and look, do people get cancer?

281
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Yes, people get cancer. Do, do horrible things happen to people to families? Yes, absolutely.

282
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
How do you respond to those things? Is the question, how do you take ownership of what you do next?

283
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:24.000
And, and that's the, that's the big difference. And if what you do next is, is, you know, say it's out of my control and I can't do anything and you're, get the mentality that you're a victim of what's happening around you.

284
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
That means you're not going to make any changes to transform your life and move in a more positive direction. It's just the way it is.

285
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And, you know, I think, I think one of these things that happens with,

286
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
you know, these ideas behind socialism in America and again, it's, it's like crazy that we would be sitting here talking about this, anybody that,

287
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000
anybody that reads anything about history knows that this is just not good, but, you know, it comes across always as,

288
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Hey, well, what we want to do is help everyone out. That's what we want to do. We want to help everyone out.

289
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
And, okay, if that's like the core belief and this is where I think sometimes we could do better or, you know,

290
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
someone like myself could do a better job explaining to people, look, if you care about other human beings,

291
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
so much, if you want to help as many people as possible in this country, the best possible thing you could do is allow the market to flourish,

292
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000
allow people to build businesses. That's what you, that's what changes people's lives, that's what helps not giving them a handout and making them reliable or a lot,

293
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000
or a reliant on the state. It doesn't help anybody. It helps them for a week. You know, it helps them for that pay period,

294
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
but it doesn't help them transform their lives into something more positive.

295
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000
One way I explain that exact sentiment is to ask someone to imagine how they would raise their kid if they love their kid.

296
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
You know, would you give them whatever they want? Would you, would you tell your kid that whatever they do wrong?

297
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
It's not their fault. Somebody else made them do it wrong. Would you tell them that there's no consequences for their actions?

298
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Would you tell them that if they do an hour of chores and they're sibling those three hours of chores that they deserve the same reward?

299
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Would you teach them any of these things? There is no liberal who would teach other kids these things? They don't.

300
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Because they love their kids and they want their kids to be successful.

301
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
But that's effectively what we're teaching, what we're saying that we should teach our citizens.

302
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And so I ask people why don't we treat our citizens the way we treat our kids as if we loved them?

303
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Because that's true compassion. It doesn't mean we don't have a social safety net.

304
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And that's always the counter argument. It's a disingenuous counter argument.

305
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Well, the counter argument that is look with your kids.

306
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And this is an example that I use when I especially when I'm talking to businesses. So I say listen, like what will be with a startup, right? That's grown from you know, they were ten people.

307
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Then there are hundred people. Now they're getting to that threshold.

308
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And I say listen at some point, you're going to have to put some discipline on what's going on inside your company.

309
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
You're going to have to have people come to work at a lined times.

310
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
You're going to have to have them eat lunch at certain times.

311
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Right, not just one that you're going to have to have meetings that are scheduled. And look, when you've got a company of twelve people, you can get away with all that stuff.

312
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
And it's great. There's money coming in and everything's.

313
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
But as soon as you start to grow, well, you have to start to have discipline inside your organization.

314
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Right. And so the example I give people is I say listen, have you ever met a kid that when he's born, look, when a child is born, you give whatever they want.

315
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
You've got to keep them alive, right? There's your social state like you have to give them food, water, milk. You have to get you have to feed them. You have to take care of them.

316
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
If you continue to do that when they're three, four, five.

317
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Well, by the time they're ten, you actually now have Satan for a child because this kid is totally out of control demanding.

318
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:06.000
But doesn't know how to do anything for themselves. Can't make themselves a sandwich. Can't tie their own shoes. It can't do anything. So what you have to do is you have to let people, for themselves.

319
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You have to let kids brush up against the guardrails of failure. You have to do that. And yes, you have to do that with society as well. In my opinion.

320
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And that's what the thing, the argument that I don't hear back at people that are saying, hey, we should give everything away for free is listen.

321
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:42.000
We don't have enough to give away everything for free. The best way that you can take care of the most amount of people is to allow freedom, allow individual freedom, allow people to pursue goals, allow people to pursue business, allow people to grow things and hire people.

322
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
That's how we all win.

323
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.000
It's so it's crazy to me that we still have these discussions. And it's also, yeah, it's crazy to me that we're having these discussions right now.

324
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:07.000
There's like this, just like this belief that they subscribe to, which is it only politicians want so mean and corrupt. You know, there's all these things hidden that we could just give you.

325
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And I'm just like, does that really sound right? Like this? It's just that really sound like that's that's correct. That was just all just extra money just hidden in the in the in the treasury that we could just give out, but we don't want to that everybody that we have all these luxury apartments that we could just give out, you know, because housing is a right or whatever or that or that there's just enough doctors and hospitals to take care of everyone and they're just kind of waiting around like not, you know, I mean like come on.

326
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:53.000
It's not, if it sounds too good to be true, it most certainly is. And again, it doesn't mean that we don't want to keep striving for a, you know, broader access to healthcare doesn't mean that we want to keep don't want to keep striving for a more efficient social safety net.

327
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Not saying that, but the, but the lurch to the, to the progressive left and socialism is it's it's based upon this idea that that we're keeping something from you know, and it's just not true.

328
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Based on this idea too that that that we're going to want to go with this, it's it's it's kind of like a constant escalation of crisis and it's it's it's it's not surprising that we got there. Okay, and this is what I mean by that.

329
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:39.000
The progressive you're generally wanting more well progress right change for the sake of change itself is often the case and you have to promise more things than you did last time, right because fundamentally it's it's it's based in the sense of compassion.

330
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Giving people things from the government and we'll think very much they don't think much more about what that does the foundation of the creation that you talked about. It's just giving people more things and it's almost like they relied on conservatives for the last hundred years to at least to at least.

331
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Being obstacle to their to their worst instincts right because the conservatives are the ones who say okay hold on like it's think of the second third order consequences of that think of what that does to our foundations.

332
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:21.000
What I say foundations I mean foundations of a free market system that creates all this wealth in the first place like you can't you can't just you can't remove the legs of the stool if you want to improve the stool I get it let's work on that.

333
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:33.000
But don't remove the legs of the stool it'll just fall same with our political foundations same with our cultural foundations is three groups that are very important we can I could go on for hours about this but.

334
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:47.000
But I'll try and stay on top on on on this line of thought here and so you promise more things and you promise more things and eventually you're like running out of things to promise and you got to meet bolder and bolder and bolder.

335
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:57.000
This is how you get socialism well intention liberalism always leads to socialism it takes years but it happens we're at that point now.

336
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Okay, like the the the the well intention liberals maybe that the the smarter you know democrats that Republicans have often worked with.

337
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I think always over promise but no full well that the Republican colleagues will sort of measure the policy and I don't think they believe it themselves frankly.

338
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
But they've created a generation that does believe it.

339
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
This is where we're at right now the aOCs of the world are true believers and they've got a lot of followers.

340
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:40.000
This is what happens when this this live compassion gets told too many times a generation starts to actually believe it and this is the situation where in now says why 70% of the millennials.

341
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Survey will say they would vote for a socialist now there's good news and bad news associated with the number like that they don't always define socialism correctly which is good.

342
00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And also I was having a conversation or something about this today I mean in 1968 how many 20 year olds would have said they would have voted for socialism it probably be a private 70% as well.

343
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Yeah, you know there was a socialist candidate I can't remember the name right now but I just saw this quote and it was so interesting because that socialist communist candidate back then in the 60s.

344
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Basically said what I just said you know you you've got to I can't remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of the the elements of liberal policy are there to eventually create the fabric of socialism for us.

345
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
It's like it's it then that is exactly what happens it happens a little bit of a time and here here's another way of thinking about it that that help people understand.

346
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And then the minimum minimum wage okay and you want to raise it to 15 bucks an hour 20 bucks an hour.

347
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
And that's fine there's it's guaranteed that you will lose jobs when you do that that's it's guaranteed okay.

348
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And so you lose jobs and depending on how much you raise it in the cost of living in that area you'll lose a certain number of jobs.

349
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Well the the well intention liberal and government who wants to control the economy says well we don't want to lose the jobs okay we'll just make people higher more.

350
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Just make make the employers higher more people okay fine so you make them higher more people but they still have to pay them in a one-way.

351
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Well they're costs haven't changed and they're they're overall budget hasn't changed so so now what will then they have to raise prices right raise prices drastically.

352
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Well now there's hyperinflation and now that's not good and also the poor people can't afford the things that they want to buy so that's not good okay we'll just make them lower the prices.

353
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
What we're going out of business okay just take over the business so now you own the means of production.

354
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And I'm not saying it happens that quickly but that's how it happens like there's there's there's a logical line there will that well intention for step of intervening in the markets.

355
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And then you're going to have consequences and eventually if you want to control it you have to really control it and then you're in a really bad place because then you're then you're then you're actually controlling production and when you do that well then you're in a place called Venezuela yeah and that isn't turning out so well.

356
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
All right little tangent right there.

357
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:13.000
It's actually I go into this huge discussion about the minimum wage in the book.

358
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Not because it's actually relates to mental toughness because the way I relate it in the book is.

359
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Part of being part of having fortitude part of being mentally tough is having the ability to think through some questions before you react emotionally.

360
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I'm pretty sure I think that example is used in the chapter called be still and I mean that quite literally just be still when you hear something that is emotionally triggering or you disagree with.

361
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Think about this notion that there might be another side to the story like just maybe if you just ask some questions.

362
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And at first again the minimum wage it seems like the right thing to do like people should just get paid more I want them to get paid more they should.

363
00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:06.000
So I just give the arguments in there like there's economic arguments and there's geographical arguments by that I mean you know why would you have a federal minimum wage the same for the entire country when in San Francisco the the rent is $3,500 a month and in Lubbock Texas $700 a month.

364
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.000
You know does that that just that really quickly makes the case against a federal minimum wage not saying that each city can't do their own thing.

365
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And then I go into the economic arguments of who's actually working a minimum wage jobs the the point isn't to make the argument against the minimum wage the point is to get you to understand that.

366
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
This issue like many many other issues and questions has many many layers to it.

367
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And if you stop and you think or at first assume those layers exist right the next step is look into the layers and there might be more to it and when you do that you are exhibiting mental strength you're exhibiting the ability to not react.

368
00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:00.000
But to just ask questions like I have a feeling just a feeling that the people really angrily waving those 15 dollar minimum wage signs have not looked into the arguments.

369
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
It's yeah, but they're passionate.

370
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Yes, really you know it.

371
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Yeah, at our factory up in Maine.

372
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Yes, this is a classic thing like sometimes you need more people to load boxes and who do you get who do you get to load boxes is an unskilled job like hey we just need you to move.

373
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And so I'm not even loading by it's moving boxes from here in the warehouse to where they're going to get loaded on trucks to get to shipped out you know you know who wants that job a kid that's a.

374
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:38.000
16 years old that you know that needs gas money and he's going to work that job two hours a night whatever and make a little bit of cash on the side.

375
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
That's cool we get a for to do that at the at our business.

376
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
The minute you say hey instead of paying that guy 10 bucks now you got to give him $16 now or well now it's guess what we're going to take.

377
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000
We're going to just take some of our other labor and have them fill in you know half an hour or half an hour there and all of a sudden you've eliminated three jobs.

378
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000
The overall budget of the business does not change just because you change the minimum wage, but there's this like belief and again you know it's.

379
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:17.000
I'm always amazed by how little pockets put into some of these you know feel good policy policy proposals like as if there's no second third order consequences to these things and like you just you have to think through that.

380
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
You just have to that would be nice.

381
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
All right.

382
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Let's get back to the book.

383
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I'm going to take you back to the book you just you just debrief the entire book we can just say and now.

384
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
All right so here we go.

385
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Uh, awake now and long stool. I could not move.

386
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
I was beaten and for the moment physically broken.

387
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
I was riddled with shards and debris under under the skin and deep within.

388
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I was swollen badly suffering from a thousand small cuts everything burned and itched.

389
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
They'll oddly enough.

390
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
I don't recall any pain in my eyes.

391
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
I said before that I woke up unable to see, but this was not entirely true.

392
00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I could see I could not see my surroundings true, but I was certainly seeing.

393
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
I was surrounded by constant hallucinations.

394
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
The result of my optic nerve still communicating erratically with my brain.

395
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
The hallucinations were lucid and all followed a pattern.

396
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
I was an Afghanistan. I was with the guys.

397
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
I was in an Afghan village mud walls and compounds.

398
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
There was an Afghan man sitting next to me.

399
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
There were piles of weapons in the corner.

400
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
I lived my previous experiences.

401
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
I lived my previous experiences over and over again.

402
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I knew it wasn't real. I was hallucinating, but not delusional.

403
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
If I was awake, I was seeing these images.

404
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
If I was lucky enough to fall asleep and dream, never more than 30 minutes,

405
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
then I would wake up and still wake up still inside the visual reality of the dream.

406
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
That sounds insane.

407
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
That was, that was insane.

408
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Now, was some of that drugs were you on? Were you on any drugs that were given you hallucinations?

409
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
No.

410
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
This was just all your optic nerve communicating.

411
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
There's some research this later in life.

412
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
There's some history of this happening to people who go suddenly blind

413
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
that that optic nerve will continue to do that.

414
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
It couldn't have been drugs.

415
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
The only drugs I was on were painkillers and that wouldn't have that effect.

416
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
It was just some weird things.

417
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
It was so weird.

418
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
It kind of terrifying.

419
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
It amplified the whole experience.

420
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Because I knew it wasn't real.

421
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
I knew it wasn't real.

422
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I would always see them there.

423
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I would talk about them.

424
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
The stranger's stories are from my friends.

425
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
There's a couple of seals who came to me with Lance to Lance's tool.

426
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.000
It was such a enormous blessing. You can't even describe how important it is for somebody

427
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
in that state to just have somebody they know.

428
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Or at least somebody they kind of trust.

429
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
It doesn't even have to be a team guy you know.

430
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
It could just be somebody who understands you.

431
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Just there.

432
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I remember this old Afghan man sitting next to me.

433
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
It was always like a weird blue light.

434
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
It really was like a dream out of the movies.

435
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Where like a face would be kind of melting.

436
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I just remember that very specifically.

437
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
I don't remember all the hallucinations.

438
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
But I always remember piles of weapons.

439
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
It was really like we were.

440
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
It was remembering the moments which were so many because we would always do two to three

441
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
day ops on that particular deployment.

442
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And so we'd hold up in some compound.

443
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
And it was you know it's like all the guys are just in this tiny little room together.

444
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Shoot the shit and our weapons are kind of strewn throughout.

445
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
And that's what I would see.

446
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I would just see that experience all the time.

447
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And the mud walls and one particularly weird dream.

448
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
And I think I do describe this in the book.

449
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
It's I was like I was in a third world country.

450
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And like in a department store.

451
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You know like going through a very crowded department store.

452
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Not with people but with clothes.

453
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Like they're like they you know because in like a lot of these countries.

454
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
They just it's not like Walmart.

455
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
You know where you can comfortably walk through things like they pack too much stuff in.

456
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Because they don't have that much space.

457
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
But they got a lot of stuff and they pack it in there.

458
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
And I'm just like trying to move through these clothes and it's like musty and the lights are fluorescent.

459
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Like again like this is just a very terrible country kind of scene.

460
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
You know I couldn't say where it was but I've been to a lot of terrible countries.

461
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
So my mind is used to this sort of visualization.

462
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And then I woke up and I know I'm awake but I'm still there.

463
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
And that's what really sucked to not be able to leave the nightmare.

464
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Like I was literally living in a nightmare.

465
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And we always used the word literally wrong in our modern day society.

466
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
I'm not using it wrong.

467
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I was literally living in the nightmare.

468
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And like it was in a scapeble.

469
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And that that's what sucked because like you just couldn't you couldn't shake it.

470
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And that's that's a there's just a horrible place to be.

471
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And finally went away when a nurse and a student nurse and a observant nurse just realized what was going on.

472
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And she started asking us about it.

473
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And my wife is just like kind of exasperated at this point.

474
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
She wasn't my wife then but she was a fiance then.

475
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
And she was just you know exhausted and like just trying to deal with this.

476
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
And I think it was like I think it was like right after my first surgery or maybe right before I don't remember.

477
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
But she was just like how long has this been going on.

478
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And we're like the whole time.

479
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Like ever since I woke up.

480
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
You know, so days and maybe a week I'm not really sure.

481
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
And she's like that's not good.

482
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
She should.

483
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I mean her response was like you will have a reprobable PTSD if this continues.

484
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
You know, because like you just living in a nightmare is not a great place.

485
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
It's just and and so she shot me up with a bunch of adivine which was like it's a hard anti anxiety drug.

486
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And then then it got really weird.

487
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Then the hallucinations change.

488
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000
They didn't go away right away.

489
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
They changed to Christmas.

490
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000
So I was like in a I was like in a like a like a root off the red nose reindeer Christmas world.

491
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
This is what you're seeing.

492
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Yeah, even though you can't see anything.

493
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
This is what you see.

494
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Yeah, it's very Christmas world.

495
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
It's very vivid.

496
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
It's not like when you close your eyes and imagine things.

497
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
It's like it was vivid.

498
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
The Christmas world was cool.

499
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Like that was that's cool.

500
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Yeah.

501
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
It was more relaxing.

502
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
It was like it was happier.

503
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
And then it went black.

504
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
And then black black was the best.

505
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
That was that was good.

506
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
It was like you would never think that you'd be happy to be blind.

507
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
But like that was that was a good.

508
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
It was necessary.

509
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000
I could finally take a nap going back to the book here.

510
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Tara.

511
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
This was your fiance at the time.

512
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Tara was there when I finally arrived in Bethesda and never left my side from that moment on.

513
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Most of my family came up to see me as did many friends.

514
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
They were far more worried than I was and their spirits were low.

515
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
This was most likely due to the fact that they were mentally coherent enough to sense the pessimistic

516
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
expectations of my surgeons.

517
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
The doctors did not think I would see again.

518
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
They said so many times and I simply didn't believe them.

519
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000
My optimism, my self deception and my belief that the coming surgery on my left eye would work

520
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
and that I would see was nothing less than a delusional gift that allowed me to keep my sanity.

521
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
But I am not one for over expressions of faith.

522
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
I will say this.

523
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
I genuinely believe.

524
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
God's strength was working through me then.

525
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
He was allowing me to believe something impossible.

526
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I prayed and my family prayed and we believed.

527
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
We believed that the military surgeons would pick through a pierced and shrapnel ridden eye.

528
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Remove the most miniscule shards in debris.

529
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And then restore my sight.

530
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
We did not have good reason to believe it.

531
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
But we did.

532
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000
It is interesting that you call this self deception and delusional.

533
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
It sounds like everyone else was just like, hey man, you know, isn't it going to work?

534
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Yeah, it was really stopped saying.

535
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
It was like, that's exactly right.

536
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
It was a necessary self delusion.

537
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And again, I was like, I don't know why that was.

538
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
And that's why I say it could have been God.

539
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
God saying, you know, I can't.

540
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
I'm not going to save your eye for you, but learn real-anseurgence to do that.

541
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
But I will at least allow you to believe that it's possible because otherwise you're going to go nuts.

542
00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And again, it's, I think my, you know, whatever you want to call it, post-traumatic growth afterwards is a function of being able to,

543
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
to live through the experience a certain way.

544
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Because it's terrifying to think that you might not see again.

545
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
That's terrifying.

546
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
And I, and I, and I'm again, because that, that chapter is called perspective from darkness.

547
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
There are other veterans who immediately lost both eyes.

548
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
They had no chance of seeing again.

549
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
That's hardship.

550
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
And I didn't have to deal with that, you know,

551
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
if somebody else has had it worse than you.

552
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
I always remember that, even when you get blown up in the face.

553
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
But yeah, the doctors and that, that continued.

554
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
It wasn't just being able to see anything again.

555
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
It was being able to see well again.

556
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
I was demanding, I was demanding the first surgery.

557
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
So the first surgery for my left eye.

558
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Because my right eye's gone.

559
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
All right.

560
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
I was gone in candle-hard.

561
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
They have it to be an off-the-mologist there that,

562
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
that, that, that new created the eye right away.

563
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000
They do that early on so that your body will focus on the, the eye that's, you know, possibly

564
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
savable.

565
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
But the right eye was so screwed up.

566
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
I wish that picture stuff it.

567
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
And that's kind of gruesome.

568
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
You know, people don't want to take pictures of you in that.

569
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Because they're like, oh, that's not good to take pictures of you.

570
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000
But, you know, keep in mind that the person might want those pictures later on.

571
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
That's, you know, people don't realize.

572
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
They had cursed the end of song.

573
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And she got, you know, she got in a Heal of Crash and Afghanistan.

574
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
And, you know, she's a beautiful girl.

575
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
And she had pictures of her face where 50 cow, like the way that he low went down.

576
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
I mean, it, it did some massive damage to her face.

577
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
And she has pictures of it.

578
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And you look at the pictures and you can't believe that, you know, she was able to recover

579
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
of the way she did.

580
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Yeah.

581
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
It's amazing.

582
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
But, you know, she's a Marine.

583
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
And I will say that she's much aligned with your feelings on this.

584
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
I think she's pretty stoked that she has those pictures.

585
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
And for example, fall jack to her.

586
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
You know, I'll tell you.

587
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
You know, I'll tell you, you know, those pictures, was it the kind like, oh, after they got into like the medical,

588
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
you know what?

589
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Actually, I think it was, I think it was, if you remember her story, there was some really good plastic surgeon, like a,

590
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Right.

591
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
The least surgeon, female plastic surgeon that I think was probably like, oh, I'm in document this.

592
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Yeah, see.

593
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000
So there's a difference between that and then like, someone being like, a weight guys and bust up the phone and start taking pictures, like, which is what you think a team guy would do.

594
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
And it would obviously go, oh, cool check out dance, other eye.

595
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I'm going to get some snaps of this.

596
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
And we got some, you know, so I've only got one picture, but it's a good week out.

597
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
I mean, it's not, it's at least a few days.

598
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Like it's, there's some healing that has taken place.

599
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
But I look, I look bad.

600
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Like it looks like a shock.

601
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I look like I had hit in the face with a shotgun.

602
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
That's what my face looks like.

603
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
I get show it to you right now.

604
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
If you really want to see it, just so you can react to it on the, but it's a little bit of, let's see.

605
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
But I've never posted it because it's a little, it's a little too gruesome for posting.

606
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
You're a blur it out.

607
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
But, um, get the option.

608
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000
But, uh, yeah, the, um,

609
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Well, not kind of lost my chance.

610
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Where, where, where we are.

611
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
So you get that, you get the surgery.

612
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
And the book, you talk about, they, they removed, um, the broken lens.

613
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Yeah.

614
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Some copper wire that was in there.

615
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Right.

616
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
A bunch of other debris.

617
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
So hallucination stop.

618
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
And then, then you're six weeks.

619
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
They got to put you in a position for six weeks to recover.

620
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Right.

621
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Um, so there's a couple things that happened here.

622
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
That's the picture.

623
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Oh, that's a, that's about a week after.

624
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
So there's, there's some healing there, but that's not looking great.

625
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Yeah, that's rough.

626
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
So, yeah, right, I,

627
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Yeah, right, I's gone. Left eye has a, has a cataract, um, meaning the lens, which is in the middle of your eye is, uh, is destroyed.

628
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Cataracts are pretty normal thing for older folks to get, you know, just basically means the lens has kind of,

629
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I don't know, the right term is, but it kind of clouds over.

630
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
You need to replace it.

631
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Um, in my case, it was trauma induced.

632
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
So it's much, much of fragments burst through the eye and, and destroyed the lens.

633
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
You can kind of look at a lens like a window.

634
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
All right.

635
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
And this is an important way of thinking about it.

636
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Because if it clouds over, if that window is just, you can't see through it anymore,

637
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
we'll just replace the window pane.

638
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
But if the blast destroys the window, then you're trying to sew a new window pane onto basically the curtains,

639
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
which are like the scolaryl of your eye.

640
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
And that was sort of the, the situation I was dealing with.

641
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
So the first miracle was they removed the lens entirely.

642
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
So, okay, so that things out.

643
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Because I remember this, I think, I think it was in landstroll.

644
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
I sort of remember them shining a really bright light.

645
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
My eye just to see if I could see light.

646
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000
And I could see some light. When they did that, what I saw was like darkness.

647
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
But there was like a light.

648
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
And it was like, we're in this room right now.

649
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000
And there's this bright light.

650
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
But of our heads is kind of like that.

651
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
But everything else was like a cloud.

652
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Like being like on an air, like, if imagine you're like going through a cumulus cloud as you're taking off.

653
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Like that's what it looks like.

654
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Very odd and strange.

655
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And um, again, so the first miracle, this, and then,

656
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
maybe a week later when I finally got back to the Thursday, and we did the surgery,

657
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
they removed the big copper wire that would really been destroying my eye.

658
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
So that's good.

659
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
And so we kind of start to see some blurring this after that.

660
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
You know, which is kind of what I see now.

661
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
As I look at you now, I'm wearing a contact.

662
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
And with that, if I took this contact out, I wouldn't recognize you.

663
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
I wouldn't, I wouldn't know.

664
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
I wouldn't run into things necessarily, but I can't see anything.

665
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Um, you know, it's, it's, it's, I mean, I,

666
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
it's like, you know, 21,000 vision.

667
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
It's like, I can't really see anything.

668
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
It's just, it's just blurry.

669
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Can't see close, can't see far.

670
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Can't find my glasses if I lose them.

671
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
The glasses I do have are like that thick.

672
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
So I wear it night.

673
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Um, we're on airplanes or, you know,

674
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Final feel like wearing a contact.

675
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
So that never goes away.

676
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
But at the time, I wanted it to go away.

677
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Like I wanted to be like, no, just make the eye better.

678
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
I can't, you just do that.

679
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Because I got, I got places to be, okay?

680
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
And they're like, yeah, do you?

681
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
You know, I was like, I was like, yeah, I mean, I was like, okay.

682
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So you just did this surgery.

683
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
We were moving to the cataract.

684
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Now, I want to new lens.

685
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So that I don't have to wear, like, contacts and glasses.

686
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Because I don't look cool in these glasses, right?

687
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
I'm not a fan.

688
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
And, you know, I don't really have the contact situation yet.

689
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
And then, and I actually wouldn't for two and a half years.

690
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
It would take to get a really good contact.

691
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
That's actually comfortable.

692
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
And so I was like, just do the surgery.

693
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
And they're like, well, I don't know, they're like, we really shouldn't.

694
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And I was like, okay, what's the, how much do we have to wait to do the surgery?

695
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
You know, what's the, what's the minimum time?

696
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Because I need to have it as soon as possible.

697
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Because, you know, I got to get back to the Bluetooth.

698
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
And I've got to go back.

699
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
And they're like, well, I mean, I guess technically six weeks.

700
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
I'm like six weeks, it is.

701
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
And I couldn't see them at the time.

702
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
But they're looking at each other like, what the hell are you talking about?

703
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Like, this isn't, you don't understand what your situation is.

704
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Like, they were just, I mean, and my wife tells me all this now.

705
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Because I couldn't see them.

706
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
And I couldn't, I wasn't self aware enough to gauge people's reactions.

707
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
I was in totally different state of mind.

708
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
I was on a lot of bank killers and drugs.

709
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
And so, you know, and just like, full on seal mode.

710
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Like, get the job done.

711
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
You must get back to Bluetooth and kill bad guys.

712
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And it's just like, wasn't making sense to people.

713
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Like, they were just like, I don't know what's wrong with this guy.

714
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
And so they just kind of humored me, I think.

715
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Like, they were just like, yeah, sure.

716
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
And we'll definitely do that.

717
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
But they wanted to know, they had no intention of doing it.

718
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
For good reason.

719
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And then, then what you're talking about the six weeks blindness.

720
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
That occurred later.

721
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
So, these miracles happened and like, we saved my eye.

722
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
And that was, that was really exciting.

723
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Then they, you know, but they're, but they're looking at it every day.

724
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
And they do this one test.

725
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And they see this hole in my retina.

726
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
So, that's not a big deal because it's just just a hole.

727
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
You know, it means there's some blind spots.

728
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
And as I look at you, I can kind of see the blind spot.

729
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
It's like right in my, it's annoying.

730
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
But I deal with it.

731
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
It's annoying when I read frankly.

732
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
The problem with that is you're retina.

733
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
The anatomy of your retina causes that hole to expand.

734
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
There's a film.

735
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
There's like a membrane on the back of your retina that creates tension.

736
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And so, anytime it's a hole in your retina, that means the hole will just expand slowly.

737
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
So, it's macular degeneration.

738
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
This again, this happens with older folks quite a bit.

739
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
The way to fix that is remove the membrane.

740
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
We're not really sure why the membrane's on there in the first place.

741
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
And so, you just remove the membrane and then, you're good.

742
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
All right?

743
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
But, and that's fine.

744
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
That's actually pretty normal surgery.

745
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
But, for me, it was a really high risk surgery because, you know, my eye is so fragile.

746
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
And so, they were worried about the retina attaching.

747
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Luckily, it did not, you know, because, well, who knows why.

748
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Again, God's intervention.

749
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000
And, but you do have to be faced down for six weeks to recover from that.

750
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
So, that was just...

751
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
You had to lay face down the entire time for six.

752
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
You have to lay face down because what they do is they inject this gas into your eye.

753
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
And that creates a bubble, which creates tension.

754
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
And if the bubble is meant to be pressed up against your retina to keep it in place.

755
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
God, it.

756
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
And the only way for it to press up against your retina is for you to be looking down.

757
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
And so, you just...

758
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Look, damn, it just sucks.

759
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
You just have to be faced down, doesn't matter how you're doing it.

760
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Just lay down or walk face down or whatever it is, but just make sure you're facing down.

761
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
You're six weeks.

762
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And you're blind all the time.

763
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Because, again, most of the time they'll do this like one eye at a time.

764
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
So, if somebody can see still, but, you know, I'm not a one eye at a time kind of guy anymore.

765
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
That's it.

766
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
There.

767
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
You get past that.

768
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
You say, when the six weeks were over, I sat up.

769
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
And it was not blind.

770
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Moreover, with the help of a truly remarkable contact lens from Boston site

771
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
to which the Navy referred me years later.

772
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
I was eventually returned to 2020 correctable vision in my left eye.

773
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
That's the story of being blown up.

774
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
I can't say I recommend the experience.

775
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Yet, even as it was happening, even in the moment after the blast, I had to admit it could have been worse.

776
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
I still had my legs.

777
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
I had my arms.

778
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
I had ten fingers and ten toes.

779
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
My brain worked.

780
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Even after a severe concussion.

781
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
I was still alive.

782
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000
It is impossible not to constantly think of the many veterans who have sacrificed so much more.

783
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Impossible not to think of seal petty officer, second class, Mike Montsour, who threw himself on a grenade wall on a rooftop in a modding.

784
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
I rack 2006, saving his teammates.

785
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Impossible not to think of Air Force Master Sergeant John Chapman, who fought all night against the Taliban.

786
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Coming in and out of consciousness from his wounds, eventually succumbing to them.

787
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
On that Afghan ridge line, but only after earning the Medal of Honor for saving 23 service members.

788
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Impossible not to think of my platoon members in dear friends, Dave Worson and Pat Feecks, who were killed just two months after I was evacuated from helmet.

789
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Impossible not to think of their loved ones who had been expecting them home a month later.

790
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Impossible not to think of the eight men whose initials are tattooed on my chest and remembrance.

791
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Charles Keating the Fourth.

792
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Patrick Feecks, Dave Worson, Brad Cavener, Brett Marryu, Kevin Ever, Brendan Looney, and Tom Falk.

793
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
This is the simple reality.

794
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Others have had it harder than me, many, many others.

795
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
From that darkness comes realism.

796
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000
From that realism comes gratitude, from gratitude comes perspective.

797
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The healthy sense of perspective is an antidote to outrage.

798
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It is an antidote to self-pity, despair, and weakness.

799
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:42.000
It's not a cure all for your mental state when faced with adversity, but it is sure to dull the edges of your worst tendencies toward mental breakdown.

800
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah.

801
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
That's the perspective that you and I already talked about today.

802
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That perspective that it would be seem like it would be very helpful for people to think about.

803
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
It is.

804
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And you know, I'm using extreme examples, right?

805
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Not everybody can relate to that, but they don't have to.

806
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I don't want you to go be in a terrible situation just to earn some perspective.

807
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Right?

808
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But just the simple reminder to yourself that it exists.

809
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Like somebody else has had it harder.

810
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
There's a comfort in that, I think.

811
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And it is an antidote to self-pity.

812
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Self-pity is a gateway to the outrage culture that I think we seal around us.

813
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
So if it is a gateway to the socialistic tendencies, I think that we've been seeing as of light,

814
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and you can avoid these things with some perspective and gratitude.

815
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It's hard for anybody in the teams to ever feel sorry for themselves when you know, because you know of these guys.

816
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And you know some of those guys I listed, of course.

817
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And if there's ever a reason you need to get up in the morning, not at 430, but like later, you know,

818
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
get a normal human time, then the boys who wish they could get up, you know, that's a good reason,

819
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
because they would like to be able to get up and they can't.

820
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And their widows are really wishing they would get up too, and they can't.

821
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You know, and the man I swear I mentioned on some heroes, but the widows are the heroes of the seal teams.

822
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I have yet to meet the wife of one of those guys who fell into self-pity and despair.

823
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I only know ones who have overcome with the greatest grace.

824
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It's just amazing.

825
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I've watched these women just serve as the most ultimate example mothers as well, you know, that I know you know.

826
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Like Debbie Lee for instance.

827
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Absolutely.

828
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It's just incredible to watch that fortitude.

829
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
We just couldn't do it without them.

830
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Yeah, so it's always one of the things about Mark's mom and Lafin, I talk about this a lot, is, you know, when we called her from Iraq to talk to her and to console her, she was consoling us.

831
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
She was wanted to make sure we were okay.

832
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
She wanted to make sure we were handling things.

833
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
She wanted to know if we needed anything.

834
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You know, that was her attitude out of the gate.

835
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah.

836
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And that shows you, you know, the kind of people that you're talking about, you know, someone that's taking their own personal worst nightmare that any, you know, any parent could ever have of losing their kid and immediately saying, well, what can I do for you guys?

837
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah.

838
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
This is unbelievable.

839
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
These, you know,

840
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000
it was recent, friend, good friend I lost was Chuck Keating the fourth and, you know, his wife started a foundation in his name.

841
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It's dad as well.

842
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And his family's just been incredible.

843
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But that's not, that's, that's not the exception.

844
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Like that's been the rule from what I've seen.

845
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
And it's so much harder to be the family left behind than it is to, to be us, I think.

846
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And, you know, we go and we choose to do this thing overseas.

847
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And we're doing it with our brothers and arms and we love it.

848
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And we know what's coming the next day.

849
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
We, we're in control to an extent, the greatest extent we can be.

850
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But our family is not there.

851
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Their, their life doesn't change except that we're just not there.

852
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And they don't know what's happening.

853
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And then they get a call.

854
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And I don't actually go into the detail in my wife's experience on the perspectives from darkness.

855
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
But, you know, she gets a call.

856
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And so her only consolation is that it's a call and not a guy at the door.

857
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But, you know, it's a call that she's getting before 6 a.m.

858
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And before she her alarm goes off to go to work.

859
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And, and then there's, you know, the, very typical kind of lack of exact information given to her.

860
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
She's not sure what my face looks like because they don't know what my face looks like.

861
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
They're not sure if it's still there. My head is still there.

862
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Like there's all this misinformation.

863
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Enough enough information to just plant seeds of absolute horror.

864
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It's horrible.

865
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And guess who, but, but, you know, who, you know, who went there first was the Looney family.

866
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh, you know, it's like it's, it's, it's Amy Looney there.

867
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You know, who just lost her husband two years earlier.

868
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And she's the one there, consoling Tara.

869
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And, um, it's just, uh, that, that's the type of community that the seal teams is blessed with.

870
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And, um, you know, it's, it is, it is a true blessing.

871
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And it's unique.

872
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I wish it were broader.

873
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I wish we could say, you know, I, I talked to other friends and other,

874
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
other communities.

875
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Um, that, that, that, that, that, it doesn't seem,

876
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
it's not as good and I wish it was.

877
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I wish, we should all strive to just, to, to take care of each other in that way.

878
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So, rolling into your next chapter and I haven't made my,

879
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
caveat that I always make, I'm not reading this whole book right now.

880
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And so when it skips around, it's because I'm not reading the whole book.

881
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
You have to buy the book so that you can hear the whole thing.

882
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And, and it, where it's just, you know, when you and I are going off on a bunch of tangents and,

883
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
which is awesome, but, you know, the book that has so many great details in it.

884
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And the stories are so clear and the real personal too.

885
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So, you got to buy the book to get that.

886
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Got to buy the book.

887
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You got to buy the book.

888
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So, uh, the next chapter, which you mentioned earlier is called,

889
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Who's your hero?

890
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And I'm going to jump to this part right here where you talk about the seal teams.

891
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It says the seal teams like any, like many military units are relentless in the pursuit of establishing hero archetypes.

892
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Doing so is extremely important when the goal is to create a monoculture that

893
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
operates as a mission-oriented team.

894
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
This is a community with a very deep sense of who we want to be.

895
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
We talk about it all the time and we beat it into our trainees.

896
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Jocco specifically.

897
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
It's it.

898
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Into our trainees.

899
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I did some of that.

900
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Here's some of the things that will be beaten into you.

901
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
You will be someone who is never late.

902
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
You will be someone who takes care of his men, gets to know them,

903
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
and puts their needs before yours.

904
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
You will be someone who does not quit in the face of adversity.

905
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
You will be someone who takes charge of means when no one else will.

906
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
You will be detailed oriented.

907
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Always vigilant.

908
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
You will be aggressive in your actions, but never lose your cool.

909
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
You will have a sense of humor because sometimes that is all that can get you through the darkest hours.

910
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You will work hard and perform even when no one is watching.

911
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
You will be creative and think outside the box even if it gets you in trouble.

912
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
You are a rebel but not a mute near. You are a jack of all trades and master of none.

913
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And then you go into the official ethos, which you mentioned earlier.

914
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
How is debating if I should read this and I think I'm actually just going to read it?

915
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
It's a good ethos.

916
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So here we go.

917
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
In times of war or uncertainty, there is a special breed of war.

918
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You are ready to answer our nation's call.

919
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
A common man with uncommon desire to succeed.

920
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Forged by adversity, he stands alongside America's finest special operations forces to serve his country,

921
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
the American people and protect their way of life.

922
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I am that man.

923
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
My Trident is a symbol of honor and heritage, but stowed upon me by the heroes that have gone before.

924
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It embodies the trust of those I have sworn to protect.

925
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000
By wearing the Trident, I accept the responsibility of my chosen profession and way of life.

926
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It is a privilege that I must earn every day.

927
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
My loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach.

928
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans.

929
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves.

930
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.

931
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession, placing the welfare and security of others before my own.

932
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I serve with honor on and off the battlefield.

933
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000
The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from other men.

934
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Uncompromising integrity is my standard.

935
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond.

936
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We expect to lead and be led.

937
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000
In the absence of orders, I will take charge, lead my teammates, and accomplish the mission.

938
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I lead by example in all situations.

939
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I will never quit.

940
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I persevere and thrive on adversity.

941
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
My nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies.

942
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
If knock down, I will get back up every time.

943
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission.

944
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I am never out of the fight.

945
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
We demand discipline.

946
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
We expect innovation.

947
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
The lives of my teammates and the success of our mission depend on me.

948
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
My technical skill, tactical proficiency, and attention to detail.

949
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
My training is never complete.

950
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
We train for war and fight to win.

951
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I stand ready to bring the full spectrum of combat power to bear in order to achieve my mission

952
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and the goals established by my country.

953
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The execution of my duties will be swift and violent when required, yet guided by the very principles that I serve to defend.

954
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Brave men have fought and died building the proud tradition and feared reputation that I am bound to uphold.

955
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:24.000
In the worst of conditions, the legacy of my teammates, studies my resolve and silently guides my every deed, I will not fail.

956
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
So that's the CLEFOS.

957
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And interestingly, I don't know if you do know where that came from.

958
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
No, it was actually, I just thought about that in the last three seconds.

959
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I would love to be a fly on the wall as this was getting drafted.

960
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
So it was written in 2005.

961
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
A bunch of us went to San Clemente Island.

962
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I would say there was maybe 10 or 15.

963
01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Probably 10 or 15 team guys that went out to San Clemente Island and made this and made the other like shorter one.

964
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The little short CLEFOS and it was actually part of what was driving it wasn't response to before I think it was before what year did you get to the teams.

965
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I started Buds in 2006.

966
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Yeah, okay. So in like 2003, 2004, there was a platoon that just there was a platoon commander that died his hair.

967
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:40.000
He was overseas on deployment. Died his hair, blonde, had a pierce earring and was selling drugs to his platoon.

968
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I mean, just a total disaster.

969
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And then there was a bunch of other, you know, look, as you know, as we know, like we're in the news a lot.

970
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And there's spikes, we're in their news for some negative things.

971
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And so there was a couple other really negative things. That was kind of the peak was this guy dealing drugs inside of his own platoon.

972
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And the platoon being a total disaster and getting disbanded and sent home from deployment.

973
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
By the way, this is like during a time of war.

974
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000
So, you know, the admiral who was a great guy said, look, we need to do something about this.

975
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And that's what we went out and the, and this is what came out of it.

976
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'm looking at, I still remember some little things like there were some things where I was, you know, a little bit more.

977
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I wanted, I wanted them to be a little bit more aggressive on some things.

978
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Yeah. I remember, I remember I got shut down one of the lines that I was like, no, it should be destroy your enemy.

979
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Like that's what we do. And it didn't make the cut.

980
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I think it was in, I think it was this part right here where it says, I stand, I stand to, I stand ready to bring the full spectrum of combat power to bear in order to achieve my mission.

981
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And the goals established by my country. My version, it was to achieve my mission and destroy my enemy or destroy the enemies of our country.

982
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Yeah.

983
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And I got, I got the reins pulled in on me. There was quite a few, but you know, I did all right.

984
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I mean, we got some discipline in there.

985
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I love to see what the Jacob version would be.

986
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yeah.

987
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You wanted to go more aggressive? No way.

988
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Like that's impossible to believe.

989
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You know, it's interesting. And one of the reasons that, like a lot of the, the discussion around it,

990
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and there were some great, and there was a bunch of great guys out there.

991
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I mean, it was like the animal pit guys to go out there was pretty awesome, a great crew of people.

992
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And at the time, you know, it was 2005, like, we didn't really have as much combat experiences we have.

993
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
You know, now, which is just awesome.

994
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
But my attitude was like, listen, we're not writing this for 05s, right?

995
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
We're not writing this for sealed team commanders or commoners.

996
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Like this thing should be leveled at the point of aim point of impact should be an E5 team guy.

997
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Look, I know that this guy that was a, was an officer that had this bad balloon, but like, that's, that's who, not who we're name it.

998
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
We should not have those problems. And like, that's, yes, we got to handle that.

999
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
This should be a point of aim point of impact should be an E5 team guy.

1000
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
That's, that's, that's needs to understand the ethos and go, hey, I need to do the right thing.

1001
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Because by the way, if you're an uplatoon and you've got square to eight Fives, they'll destroy that.

1002
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
They'll, they'll crush that officer that's doing dumb things.

1003
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
They'll, they'll kill him. Well, not kill him.

1004
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Literally Vietnam, Fraxile, but they will get him removed, you know, and, you know, that's what will happen.

1005
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So yeah, I think it hits that pretty well.

1006
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Yeah, yeah, it does pretty good. It does pretty good.

1007
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah, it's, it's a great ethos. And it was awesome to, to be out there when this thing was getting written.

1008
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And then see it, you know, it, it, it's always interesting to be a part of things like that that you don't really know, like, I mean,

1009
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000
you don't really understand what you're doing at the time. You know, you're just trying to get the job done, you're trying to do a good job,

1010
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
but you don't always know what the impact is going to be later when you, when you do something like that,

1011
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
but you have some honor to be out there and make that happen or help make that happen again.

1012
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
There's a bunch of people out there.

1013
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I was, I, I, I made very well with it.

1014
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say it was the junior guy, but there, because there was, you know, there was a bunch of mass chiefs out there,

1015
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
a bunch of badass mass chiefs here. So, yeah, it's cool.

1016
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And it's just, it's so important.

1017
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And I'm going to stop jumping ahead on the book now that I understand what we're doing because of

1018
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
already.

1019
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah, I already hit this part.

1020
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Should I free brief to you?

1021
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I guess. Yeah.

1022
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But the, it's so important for an organization to understand who they want to be.

1023
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And, and that, that was the whole reason I put the ceiling, those in there, because there's a deep cultural mindset that is beaten into us, you know, quite literally.

1024
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
There's the more high-minded philosophical approach, which is the seal ethos.

1025
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000
But it does a good job of relating to the, to the lowest level guy, too.

1026
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But it's, it goes way beyond the seal ethos.

1027
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I mean, there's so many other lessons that get repeated like mantras throughout training throughout Buds, about who you are.

1028
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Like what it means to be a guy wears the trident, like what that really means.

1029
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And, and this is simple stuff, you know, and I listed some of it earlier, right?

1030
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I don't quit just beyond time. Like work when no one's watching, you know, it's like just really simple stuff, but it's like, it's who you better be.

1031
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And you better be funny.

1032
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Like, you know, that's actually part of our culture.

1033
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Part of being better to you better have a really sick sense of humor.

1034
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And like, you better go after each other, but it better be funny, you know, it's got to actually, and like, we rely on that dark humor and a really fundamental way.

1035
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I, that I think, maybe, maybe a side of us that isn't as prevalent in all the books and all the movies, but like, I like to think we're pretty, pretty funny.

1036
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I mean, I've been on Saturday night live, so obviously I'm funny.

1037
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Yeah, I know, a thick skin and, you know, the ability to verbally spar with people 24 hours a day from the moment you report into work, the moment you show up until, and any mistake that you make, you better, you know,

1039
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
you, you throw a shot on a, you know, while you're shooting, you throw a shot and hit something that you shouldn't hate or whatever.

1040
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
It's just sign up for ridicule because that's what's about to happen.

1041
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
That's the greatest thing.

1042
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It really is.

1043
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
You got a bunch of stuff in here that's, you start talking about traits.

1044
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And you know, again, it's what you're talking about.

1045
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Some of the traits of you must be someone that can take a joke.

1046
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Uh, did this a very simple.

1047
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You want to be productive.

1048
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You want to be someone that makes progress every single day.

1049
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You want to be someone who identifies a goal and sticks with it.

1050
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Again, you don't like about these.

1051
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It's just going back to your conversation.

1052
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Like, if you think about how you would want your kid to act, these are good things.

1053
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
This is how you want your kid to act.

1054
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You want to be, you want to be seen as reliable.

1055
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
You want people to ask things of you because you have a reputation for getting it done.

1056
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Reliability is an element of fortune.

1057
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
A mentally tough person can avoid the next cupcake and save it for later after earning with some exercise.

1058
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
You want to be even tempered.

1059
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You don't want to ever want to lose it.

1060
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Emotion don't drive your actions.

1061
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You want to be humble.

1062
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
You have confidence, but not overbearing.

1063
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Uh, you want to be someone that internalizes someone else's point of view before speaking at them.

1064
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Like, these are the kind of things you're talking about.

1065
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
And, and you, you, you, you, you say this.

1066
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
The question is, how do we become the heroes we want to be?

1067
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
My answer sanctioned intellectual property theft.

1068
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
That's how no one has a pat, no one good habits.

1069
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
You can steal them.

1070
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Identify your heroes and emulate the character traits that make that person more successful than you currently are.

1071
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And this, and this gets into, this, I love this.

1072
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
This is one of my favorite chapters to write because I love psychology.

1073
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You know, Jordan Peterson's one of my favorite thinkers out there.

1074
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Um, there's a lot of psychological references in this chapter.

1075
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And, um, and another one too, but especially this one.

1076
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And hero archetypes.

1077
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And we already already hit what I meant by hero archetypes.

1078
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And that, and I just think that's so important.

1079
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
You have to have a visualization of what you're looking up to.

1080
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You have to look at yourself in ten years and think,

1081
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Okay, that's, that's how, how, how would that person react to this situation?

1082
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I should react that way now.

1083
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Like, you know, and it's hard.

1084
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And this isn't supposed to be easy.

1085
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And when I say sanctioned intellectual property theft, it's like,

1086
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Look at the attributes of people you respect.

1087
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
You know, like, what did they do?

1088
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And like, if you want to get to where they're at, just copy them.

1089
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
This isn't, this isn't rocket science.

1090
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Um, you know, this is, any, any of your listeners are like, well, yeah, that's why listen to Jocca.

1091
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Yeah, you know, listen to who is, and you and I were talking about this earlier.

1092
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Uh, this idea of sanction intellectual property theft, you know,

1093
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
uh, extreme ownership.

1094
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Is this, is personal responsibility, did I, did I make up personal responsibility in the form of extreme ownership?

1095
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
No, I didn't, I didn't make up the, you know, discipline equals freedom.

1096
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Did I, am I the first person that ever said, you know what?

1097
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
If you have discipline in your life, you'll have more freedom.

1098
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I mean, it's in the Bible.

1099
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Like, these, these are things that I, old ideas are the best idea.

1100
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And, you know, maybe I wording them away that was easier for people to understand or came out of from a different angle or whatever.

1101
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But the fact of the matter is this stuff's out there.

1102
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And these are these, these traits that you're talking about are just, as you were saying earlier, it's like,

1103
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Oh, if you, we want your kid to not lose their temper.

1104
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
That's what you, you want your kid to be reliable.

1105
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
These are really basic things.

1106
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
And yet, if you don't identify them, which is your point.

1107
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And you know, that's what, in the Warrior Kid book.

1108
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So I read these kids books.

1109
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Well, one of the things in the Warrior Kid books is first his uncle, who's a seal, teaches him all the different codes.

1110
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Mm-hmm.

1111
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
All the different warrior codes from, from ancient times till today to the Ranger code to the seal code.

1112
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
They're, they're in the book.

1113
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And then he says, you need to write your own code.

1114
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
And that's what he does in the book.

1115
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Right, his own code of what it means to be a warrior kid.

1116
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And that's what he lives up to.

1117
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So same thing you're saying here.

1118
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah.

1119
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And that again, the discussion about hierarchies and why that's kind of an important way of looking at this.

1120
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Because in, in also why I say, you don't pick a person to be your hero.

1121
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
You pick many.

1122
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Real or imagine the characters who, who excel in a certain hierarchy.

1123
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And that, that's an important thing to define.

1124
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
There's different types of hierarchies.

1125
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Like some people excel in a jujitsu hierarchy.

1126
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
If you want to be good at jujitsu, copy this person.

1127
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Okay.

1128
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
But you don't listen to everything they say because they might be all screwed up in some other way.

1129
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
This is, right?

1130
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
This is a fact.

1131
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah.

1132
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Um, but, but like, you know, follow this leader.

1133
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Like, there's something about that leader that I like.

1134
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
And there's something that makes me want to follow them.

1135
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
What is it?

1136
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I should identify it.

1137
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I can start to emulate those behaviors.

1138
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
One note I made in, in your book here is,

1139
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I'm a, when you said, when you said to do that, I have plus bad examples.

1140
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And in my latest book, Leadership Strategy and Tactics,

1141
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I had this beautiful situation unfold where I had a horrible officer that we had a mutiny and got him fired.

1142
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
And then the guy that took over was the best guy ever.

1143
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And super humble gave us ownership.

1144
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I mean, it was just awesome.

1145
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But I learned, probably as much from the egotistical guy and seeing how we all reacted to him and seeing

1146
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
how we didn't want to listen to him.

1147
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
We didn't want to follow him.

1148
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
As I learned from the guy that was just fantastic leader.

1149
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000
So I look at, you know, hey, here's, I always always pulling the good things from people.

1150
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But then also looking at people with negative examples and saying,

1151
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Okay, I know not to act like that.

1152
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
The villains.

1153
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Yeah.

1154
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
That hero's got to have villains.

1155
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And it's, and I guess the point of that chapter is,

1156
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
yeah, to remind people of what some of the good attributes are and to, and to, and to, and to think consciously about identifying those attributes,

1157
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
identifying yourself as the hero you want to be and then living up to that.

1158
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So that's, that's part of it.

1159
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
But, but the broader cultural conversation is the fact that,

1160
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Outrage culture is largely this product of the fact that we have,

1161
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
we have started to look at the wrong hero archetypes.

1162
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000
We have started to elevate attributes that are not heroic at all into a heroic,

1163
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
reality and, and it's, it's not good.

1164
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And it's sort of, that's the second part of the chapter, the wrong heroes.

1165
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And it's, it's, it's what we talked about.

1166
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
This is a grieved victim status.

1167
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
The, the loudest person on the internet, the snarkiest person on the internet,

1168
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
the one owning the lips or the cons.

1169
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
You know, it's like, that one gets the most likes.

1170
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Like, it's, it's passion over sophistication.

1171
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And these are not good things.

1172
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I understand that it's entertaining, right?

1173
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And I understand the temptation, especially on social media,

1174
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
but it's really detrimental to our larger conversation.

1175
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
You know, why should the fist-banging activist, you know,

1176
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
you know, speaking of the power, whatever the hell that means,

1177
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
why should that be the person we listen to, just because they're mad?

1178
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Like, why does anger, big get some kind of credibility?

1179
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
It doesn't make any sense, but that's how we're acting as a culture.

1180
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
It doesn't make any sense, though.

1181
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And like, I just want us to think through that.

1182
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Like, that's the whole point of the chapter.

1183
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And we'd be better off if we started to, to kind of rediscover the heroes

1184
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
that have gotten us through thousands of years of civilization.

1185
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And again, the oldest ideas are the best ones.

1186
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
If, if people have been talking about certain heroic attributes for thousands of years,

1187
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
there's really good chances or good ideas, because they've lasted.

1188
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
And they've gone through trial and error.

1189
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
But, um, but like every generation, you know,

1190
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
you've got to, when you have to teach those the ideals.

1191
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
And then, as a young person, you have to stop and think,

1192
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
maybe there's a reason it's like this.

1193
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Maybe I'm not the first one to think in revolutionary terms.

1194
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
You know, like, just maybe, like, there's a reason your granddad

1195
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
is telling you it's this way.

1196
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And it's not because he's just stupid and out of touch.

1197
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Like, just stop.

1198
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And like, let's think about that as a possibility.

1199
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Yeah, this, it's weird with this.

1200
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I would love to try and trace back the roots of this because one thing,

1201
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
like, one time we were on this podcast, we were talking about something.

1202
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And somebody asked a question on a Q&A.

1203
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000
And I, basically, what I said was, and I think you turned it into a clip,

1204
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000
echo tross, is I was saying, like, hey, you got to stifle those emotions.

1205
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But don't let those emotions out.

1206
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
What are you kidding me?

1207
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Like, you can't let that show.

1208
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And the reaction from some people was, you know, that's horrible.

1209
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
You should never stifle your emotions.

1210
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
They'll, they'll, you, it turns into these, whatever.

1211
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
The mental problems and all this stuff.

1212
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And I'm like, people took what I said to the extreme,

1213
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
which clearly, I don't really believe in anything extreme.

1214
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
That's why I wrote the book called The Academy of Leadership, right?

1215
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
That's extreme ownership.

1216
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1217
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Well, well, interestingly, you know,

1218
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
extreme ownership can be taken too far.

1219
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And you can have people in leadership positions that go to an

1220
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
extent where they want to own everything and they don't

1221
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
decentralize anything and it becomes a problem.

1222
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Yeah.

1223
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
So that's why we wrote The Academy of Leadership because you have to find balance in everything.

1224
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So with this idea of stifle your emotions, look,

1225
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000
oh, if you lose a loved one, I'm not saying you need to, you know,

1226
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
get your tough the whole time, right?

1227
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
No.

1228
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And also as a leader in any position,

1229
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
if you're walking around completely stoic with no emotions,

1230
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000
you won't attack, you won't, you won't connect with anybody.

1231
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
And so you don't have any personal connections with anybody.

1232
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
That's not a seal, Patoon.

1233
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
If you're in a seal, Patoon, and you have no personal connection with your guys in your

1234
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Platoon, you're not a leader.

1235
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
They don't respect you.

1236
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
They won't follow you.

1237
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And I've seen that kind of leader.

1238
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Absolutely.

1239
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
It doesn't work.

1240
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It doesn't work.

1241
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
So when I say stifle your emotions,

1242
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I'm talking about your little petty emotions that you're getting.

1243
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Spongebob out some.

1244
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Yeah.

1245
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That's what I'm talking about.

1246
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And especially in my business and like a politics,

1247
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
like you realize quickly,

1248
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
you've got to define what you mean in very clear terms,

1249
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
because everybody's first reaction is to totally take it out of context or

1250
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
or just assume the worst of what you meant.

1251
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Assume the worst of intentions.

1252
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I go into the great amount of detail about this and the book too,

1253
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
because that's a big marker of outreach cultures.

1254
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
This need, this like desire to be like just assume the worst of what you meant.

1255
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Oh, stifle my emotions.

1256
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Okay, just walk around like robots. Of course, that's not what you meant.

1257
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
You know, like let's, let's be gracious with how we understand each other,

1258
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
just like just a tad.

1259
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
We'll be a lot better off.

1260
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Next chapter.

1261
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
It's called no plan B, which is, you know,

1262
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
got a little counterintuitive sound to it because as a seal,

1263
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and as a human being, you're always like,

1264
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
oh, you know, you got to have a plan B in case something goes wrong.

1265
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Yeah.

1266
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Here's your premise behind this.

1267
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
You don't entertain the plan B option because when you do your entertaining failure.

1268
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And in entertaining failure, you will embrace it ultimately the no plan B mentality

1269
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
isn't about keeping you from doing something rather it's about embracing a positive goal

1270
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
as your only choice.

1271
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
It's about enabling you to do something.

1272
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
It's about clearing the paths to your goals, to your achievements,

1273
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
to your tasks and your responsibilities.

1274
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, you're, you explain your idea behind no plan B.

1275
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
So, this started out as I was thinking about how not to quit a buzz.

1276
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
And whenever any time I'd ever been asked that question,

1277
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I would simply say, well, because I never had a choice.

1278
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Because I just didn't think about buzz as a choice.

1279
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I didn't think about it as an achievement that I would, you know, hopefully make.

1280
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It was just like, okay, I just have to do this because that's just I just have to.

1281
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
You know, and I think most of us who made it through buzz just had that mentality.

1282
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Like, okay, I just have to do another boat race.

1283
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And then man, this really sucks.

1284
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Like, I really hate this.

1285
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But I just, I don't have a choice.

1286
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You know, it's, there's no other option.

1287
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
There's something liberating about that mentality.

1288
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
It's the only mentality you can have.

1289
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And it is truly a no plan B mentality.

1290
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
So, and I'm very, and I'm, and I explain that in the book.

1291
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
I'm like, I don't mean no contingencies.

1292
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Obviously, you have to plan ahead.

1293
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
But no plan B is fundamentally about not quitting.

1294
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And not quitting needs to be defined rather carefully.

1295
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000
You know, and I, and I point out, like, changing directions in life could seem like quitting.

1296
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It's not necessarily like you're not a good artist.

1297
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Just stop.

1298
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Like you're just not good.

1299
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
It's time to change directions, man.

1300
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
You know, and that's okay.

1301
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Like that's, that's okay.

1302
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
That doesn't, you know, it's, and then I go into a much deeper conversation about living with purpose.

1303
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Ultimately, what I mean by living your plan A and not living your plan B,

1304
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
it is about living with purpose.

1305
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And purpose is, is something only you can tell really if you're living up to it or not.

1306
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
It's hard to tell from the outside.

1307
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
But you know, you know if you quit.

1308
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Like you know if you just didn't do the right thing to, to, to live up to your angle.

1309
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And, and, and, and, and, and execute the millions of smaller tasks that you need to execute to live up to your angle.

1310
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And, and I think this is also the chapter where I really go into some deeper discussions about,

1311
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000
uh, uh, uh, one of my favorite quotes from St. John Paul or Pope John Paul II,

1312
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
which is, you know, America freedom is, is, is, is, it's not the right to do what you want, but,

1313
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
but, but, but the, what the freedom to do what you ought, right?

1314
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I'm screwing up that quote a little bit, but the point is this, you live with ordered liberty.

1315
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Ordered liberty means we live with a purpose.

1316
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Like we have, we have freedom, and with that freedom, we have a responsibility to live as we ought to live.

1317
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Now we have to define, okay, what is living, how we ought to live, like that's a whole other discussion.

1318
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And this is why religion is so important. This is why religion is such an important foundation.

1319
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Our Judeo Christian history is a very important foundation of our culture.

1320
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Even if you don't believe in God, you have to admit that we get our morality from this place, from the ten commandments.

1321
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And that matters, like it matters in a really deep way.

1322
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And I'm a right, you know, kind of that sense of absolute morality, where our laws come from,

1323
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000
where this notion comes from of what it is to do the right thing, how do you define the right thing?

1324
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Again, we've already talked about this.

1325
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
If it's based in thousands of years of wisdom and trial and error, there's a good chance that it's right.

1326
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Okay, not a guaranteed chance, but there's a really good chance.

1327
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Even if it doesn't feel good or doesn't feel nice and compassionate, it's real, and it creates a sustainable society.

1328
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
And ultimately, sustainable societies should be our angle.

1329
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Our outreach culture is counter to a sustainable society.

1330
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
It is chaos manifested in our words and our actions.

1331
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Yeah, you say here, pure freedom is chaos, anarchy and moral decay, freedom to do what you like without any more.

1332
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Compass can quickly result in the temptation to indulge in habits that may feel good momentarily, but are wholly detrimental to yourself and others.

1333
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Pure freedom detached from a higher sense of purpose results in at best in overindulgence, lack of discipline, unfaithful relationships, and some drug use at worst,

1334
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
it can result in the total deterioration of a society.

1335
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And you know, I think it was actually Jason Gardner when before he was out of the team, but he was listening to podcast and he was hearing me talk about,

1336
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I think he was hearing me talk about the Gulogzer or just something, and he goes, hey, discipline equals freedom.

1337
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That applies to societies too, doesn't it?

1338
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yes, it does. If you have total freedom, everyone do it whichever you want, well then you're destroyed and you end up a slave to, well, you end up a slave to any number of things,

1339
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.000
whereas if you have discipline inside of a society which is called law and order and you fall those rules, well then you actually end up with more freedom, which is what we try to hear.

1340
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Yeah, discipline equals freedom is the simplest way of putting that because it's very true.

1341
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
And it's been true for a very long time.

1342
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Indeed, indeed.

1343
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Next chapter, again, I'm jumping forward here, next chapter, this is the chapter.

1344
01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000
This is the chapter.

1345
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
You put got to read the book, you don't want more.

1346
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Absolutely, there's a lot more in there.

1347
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:11.000
There's a ton. And you do, you give a lot of, almost academic level back up.

1348
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So you give some common sense stuff, you give some academic and you talk about the psychological, psychological viewpoint of things, some historical references.

1349
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.000
You do a great job of balancing out what you're saying and showing multiple examples from different aspects.

1350
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:35.000
So that's why the book you have to read the book to get all that information.

1351
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
The next one is called Be Still.

1352
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I got to read this little section in the sealed teams.

1353
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Our first exercise in training, the mind to be still is drown proofing.

1354
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And yes, it is as ridiculous as it sounds, as legend has it.

1355
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And it may indeed just be legend.

1356
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Drown proofing originates from the story of an American POW in Vietnam as the vehicle and transported him along the May Kong River.

1357
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
They decided they'd have enough, had enough of him and threw him overboard.

1358
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
But this was not some magnanimous gesture of human civility.

1359
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
He was not being released for good behavior. They expected him to drown.

1360
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It was reasonable expectation.

1361
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
His hands were tied behind his back and his feet were tied together.

1362
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Visualize that for a four second.

1363
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000
This creates quite the predicament, especially when you are trying not to drown.

1364
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
He had to figure out how to swim to shore.

1365
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And as the story goes, he did just that.

1366
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Ever since then, a key element of seal training involves drown proofing us,

1367
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000
making sure that we too can jump from a boat with our hands and feet tied.

1368
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And then you go over the multiple ways to do this.

1369
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000
And you say here, to do this, it requires that you do not panic.

1370
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Wall instructors are yelling, don't panic.

1371
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:58.000
And that's, you know, you talked about that as being sort of one of your first lessons in learning how to be called.

1372
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And not freak out about stuff.

1373
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
It's, it's such a necessary part of of military training.

1374
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And drown proofing is an excellent way to do it.

1375
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Not, not because we actually think that might happen.

1376
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
How unlucky with that be.

1377
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That be unlucky.

1378
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Or lucky. And it's like, wow, okay, you're just like training.

1379
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
They put a weight on you, though, your screwed or, you know, there's a lot of ways to tie you up.

1380
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Anyway, I'm not the point.

1381
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
The point is not that you're preparing for this specific eventuality.

1382
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:35.000
The point is is that you, you have a set of skills and you better implement those skills while the fear of drowning is all around you.

1383
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And of course, it gets worse than the drown proofing gets into the dive comp or pull comp, which is,

1384
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
It's probably my least favorite thing.

1385
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
When I got to Buds, I had no idea what it was.

1386
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000
They had a Texas chainsaw massacre movie poster up, but it had, it was crossed out.

1387
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
It said Buds pull comp, massacre.

1388
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
They had like, drown a regulator on the person getting murdered by leather face.

1389
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yes.

1390
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yeah.

1391
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
So I was like, well, what that is, but yeah, sure enough.

1392
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Sounds great.

1393
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I'll sign me up, you know.

1394
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I think I can.

1395
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Yeah.

1396
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I failed to go and pull comp.

1397
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I failed and I was recycled to the next class.

1398
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
No, I mean, I, I, I, we, I got to retest again on Monday.

1399
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
So we took pull comp on Friday.

1400
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah.

1401
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And we got retested on Monday if we failed.

1402
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Okay.

1403
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Well, yeah, I mean, I failed first couple of times.

1404
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I, I don't very rarely really feel through the first time.

1405
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Yeah.

1406
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I was not happy.

1407
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
What's full comp?

1408
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Pull comp is they put an old school dive, Greg on you, select the old school

1409
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
School of Tanks and this thing called the, what's it called?

1410
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Do holes regulator?

1411
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I think there's a hose that comes in that brings the ear in and there's one that you blow out.

1412
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And they put you down on the bottom of the pool and they just start to just mess with you.

1413
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
They rip your regulator, the rip your mask off.

1414
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
And then they start tying knots in your regulator that you have to then untie underwater.

1415
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And you have to follow all these proper procedures to get everything back on.

1416
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Meanwhile, they're slapping you in the head.

1417
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
They're grinding your face into the thing, into the pool deck.

1418
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And it's, it sucks.

1419
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And eventually they tie something called a whammy knot, which is a knot that you can't get out.

1420
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And so they tie this whammy knot.

1421
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And then you have to go to proper ditching procedures, which means you take your rig completely off.

1422
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
You have to attempt to get it to work.

1423
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
If you can't get it to work, you take off your weight belt.

1424
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
You lay it over your rig.

1425
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
And then you look at your instructor.

1426
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
You give them the thumbs up and then you do a proper free swimmer ascent.

1427
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And if you mess up any of you, and there's procedures for everything.

1428
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And if you mess them up, then you fail.

1429
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So, but it's, it, it's, it's, it's no joke.

1430
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Like they come out and freaking hammer you.

1431
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Yeah, that's a man.

1432
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And then they always, they always get you as you have vexed.

1433
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
So, yeah, they're watching the bubbles.

1434
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And they're the wave.

1435
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And then the wave, they call it a surf hit.

1436
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Like, so they're simulating this wave.

1437
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
This amazingly complex wave that somehow ties your hoses and knots.

1438
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
It's like, isn't true.

1439
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
That's not real, okay?

1440
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Like there's no wave like that.

1441
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000
But it's not the point.

1442
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You know, it's, it's, it's same with drown proofing.

1443
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
But the point is not to prepare you for this eventuality.

1444
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
There is no way in hell that your hoses will ever be tied to knots.

1445
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Mostly because you'll never use a rig like this.

1446
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
That actually can be tied to knots because this rig is not,

1447
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
It's, it's just for training.

1448
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So, that's not the point.

1449
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
The point is the procedures.

1450
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
The point is you're drowning.

1451
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Will you still calm yourself and work through procedures?

1452
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
That's the entire point of the exercise.

1453
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
If you panic, you are going to fail.

1454
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And there's physiological reasons for that because you're using more objects.

1455
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And freaking out.

1456
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And there's psychological reasons and just the instructor, these instructors are seals.

1457
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
They don't want to guy in the teams that's going to be on a dive with them.

1458
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
That's going to freak out if something goes wrong.

1459
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Because stuff goes wrong when you're diving.

1460
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
So that, that to, you know, from your perspective was a, was a,

1461
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000
The initial recognition of like, hey, I better be calm.

1462
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Right.

1463
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Be still as you say.

1464
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And yeah, the reason I say it,

1465
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
But the reason I say it, but he's still because I was thinking of the patrolling acronym that we use.

1466
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Okay.

1467
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So, you know, stop looking, listen, smell.

1468
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Mm-hmm.

1469
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And that's exactly what it sounds like.

1470
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
You stop because you've, you've done something to the environment.

1471
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Maybe you landed with a helicopter.

1472
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And that's actually, you know, I don't want to give too much away in the book.

1473
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
But there's a really great intro to this chapter, everybody.

1474
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
You've got to buy it and know what it is.

1475
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And so you stop and you've, you've created a disturbance.

1476
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So stop and look around, just chill and look around and then keep moving.

1477
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
That's, cells, cells.

1478
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
We just, that's what we say.

1479
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
And it's patrolling tactic.

1480
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
It also kind of sounds like still.

1481
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
And it's kind of the same meaning.

1482
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Same old for sure.

1483
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
That's why I named it chapter B still.

1484
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And, um, and then you apply that to your life.

1485
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Because I, I understand that not everybody is going to be thrown overboard with their hands and feet type.

1486
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
But if you are, I go in a great detail about how to overcome that particular predicament.

1487
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It is possible.

1488
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Yeah, there's, there's a lot of methodology there.

1489
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
It's much easier than you think, as long as you don't panic.

1490
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
So, and, uh, it'll, this is another chapter called do something hard.

1491
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
So, hey, you know what, you're do something hard.

1492
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It could be drowned proofing.

1493
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
And everybody can do this.

1494
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Do it with a buddy that you're not doing.

1495
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Do it with a buddy.

1496
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Do it with a buddy.

1497
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
It's a good answer.

1498
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
That's the worst thing.

1499
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
One up one down.

1500
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Luckily, it's hard to tie your hands behind your back without a buddy.

1501
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So, um, the, uh, the point is this, it's, again, old lessons, count to ten before you react.

1502
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
But that's, it's fundamentally what this chapter is about.

1503
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And we have a, had a habit lately, given the, um, given the extreme nature of our, uh, kind of immediate gratification that occurs with social media,

1504
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
to react very quickly and wildly about things.

1505
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Um, our media reacts unbelievably quickly and wildly about things.

1506
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And it is, it is a disservice to our country.

1507
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000
It is, I mean, I, that's an extreme statement, but it is true, it has gotten out of hand.

1508
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
And it's, it's so bad that I felt the need to write this book.

1509
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Um, our media doesn't, but we're, but again, their media is feeding off of us.

1510
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
We have to do better as individuals.

1511
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
We have to, to say, like, that's not going to work on me.

1512
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
You know, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,

1513
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that quick over the top reaction is not going to work on me.

1514
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to feed into it. I'm not going to reward it.

1515
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
That's, that's, that's our duty.

1516
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You have to not click on click bait headlines.

1517
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Yeah.

1518
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Well, I mean, I can't help myself.

1519
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I'm going to click on the click, but I'm not going to react to it, right?

1520
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
So that's the, you know, and even for good practice, go ahead and click on it.

1521
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
See if it makes you mad. And if it does do it again.

1522
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It's, like, just, it's incredible when you, when you click on a clickbait article.

1523
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And I'm talking mainstream news media. And you go, oh, my gosh, I can't believe that happened.

1524
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And then you click on it and you're like, wait a second.

1525
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Yeah.

1526
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
That's not what happened.

1527
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
I just got click baited.

1528
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Don't let it happen.

1529
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And the problem is, well, actually, see the problem is, is that people don't click.

1530
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
The problem is, oh, that's really, that's, and I go into the,

1531
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
and a lot of detail on that actually, I give some example.

1532
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I could give examples every single day.

1533
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I just kind of chose some random ones for the book.

1534
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:29.000
But an example might be, the examples I use in the book are regarding something like environmental regulations.

1535
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Because this is a very emotional topic for people.

1536
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
When you hear the Trump administration repealed 12 Obama era environmental regulations.

1537
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Here's what you're thinking. And be honest, this is what you're thinking.

1538
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You're thinking black or green sludge, oozing into a river.

1539
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
You're thinking black smoke, like emanating from a factory, all of a sudden,

1540
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000
while these corporate fat cats count their money and birds are falling out of the sky.

1541
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Like, this is what you're thinking.

1542
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
If you're being, like, this is the visualization that occurs.

1543
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
But is it true?

1544
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Nobody asks the second question.

1545
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Is it true?

1546
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Yeah.

1547
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
What does this actually mean?

1548
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Or what does it mean?

1549
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Or like, why would they deregulate that?

1550
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
You know, why was it put in place just a few years ago?

1551
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
You know, I mean, like, what kind of regulation wasn't?

1552
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
You know, is there a good reason for it?

1553
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And then I go into basically a case study on something called new source regulation.

1554
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
And we don't have to talk about it now.

1555
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
But it's, I basically write a case study on this because it's important.

1556
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Like, there's, there's good examples and there's, and there's,

1557
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
there's, and then the headline about that particular regulation.

1558
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Basically said, you know, Trump is removing air pollution regulations.

1559
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So again, your mind goes to those places I just talked about.

1560
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
The article itself kind of gives both sides.

1561
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
It's actually not about article. And this is usually the case.

1562
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And my experience, because I, you know, do this every day.

1563
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And my experience, the, the writer, the journalist is not always,

1564
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000
but a lot of times, like, actually kind of gives a balanced article.

1565
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
But the editorialized headline is terrible.

1566
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Totally misleading.

1567
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
You know, that their own article debunks the headline.

1568
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
And you're like, what the hell is going on here, okay?

1569
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Now, a lot of that's oftentimes because the journalist is not the one writing the headline.

1570
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Okay, so that's, that's a whole different story.

1571
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And then you look into it, right? And it's like, okay, well, it turns out,

1572
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000
yeah, they want to, they want to make it easier for factories to,

1573
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
to update their systems or, or power generation plans to update their systems.

1574
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
They don't want to have them go through this new source review regulation,

1575
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
which is extremely costly and unpredictable.

1576
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And environmentalists say, well, that's just, that's just,

1577
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
you're just giving away to corporations, right?

1578
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
You're deregulating them, but it's like, well, no.

1579
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000
And as it turns out, if you want to put a carbon capture addition to your power plan,

1580
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
which means capturing more pollutants or carbon dioxide,

1581
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
then you can't.

1582
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
You can't go through this extremely costly new source review.

1583
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Well, maybe we should stop that.

1584
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
You know, like, thinking that's, and that's the background.

1585
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You know, I can go to a lot more detail on that, but just one example.

1586
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I could think of an example almost every single day.

1587
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Like, the headline just isn't what you think, you know?

1588
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
But let's, let's bring it back to coronavirus.

1589
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So the headline is, you know, the Trump administration screwed up the coronavirus test.

1590
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Like, South Korea is testing 20,000 people a day,

1591
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
and we've only done like, you know, 10,000 tests or something.

1592
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And by the time you're listening to this podcast, that reality has changed drastically,

1593
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
but in our current moment, that's what happened in the last couple months.

1594
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
And there's some truth to that, like the America was behind on tests,

1595
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
but who's actually at fault?

1596
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Ask the question, right?

1597
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
And then look into the answer from some different sources.

1598
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Because the truth is FDA never approved any South Korean test.

1599
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
For all we know, those tests aren't very high quality.

1600
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
There's different kinds of tests.

1601
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
You know, they might give false positives or false negatives.

1602
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
That stuff matters when you're trying to control an epidemic.

1603
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
You know, it would be easy to just buy the South Korean test.

1604
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
We don't do that.

1605
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Because Trump said we don't want to do it.

1606
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And not because Trump isn't taking it seriously.

1607
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
It's not even Obama.

1608
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
It's actually none of their fault.

1609
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
It's just our system.

1610
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Our system is in there for a reason.

1611
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Like, we have a very strict system from the FDA on what kind of test can be used for stuff like this.

1612
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Now, that exists for a decent reason.

1613
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
For instance, if people remember the, I think it's called Theranos.

1614
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
The, the lady who has fake the fake cancer test.

1615
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
That's absolutely called Theranos.

1616
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Yeah.

1617
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Absolutely.

1618
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Yeah.

1619
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
You're very sure of that.

1620
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
No, I tracked on that big time because there's a, there's a very interesting case study.

1621
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah.

1622
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
You're in the corporate.

1623
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yeah, for about a million different reasons.

1624
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
It's a really interesting case story.

1625
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And just that.

1626
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Yeah, fake the cancer treatment.

1627
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It was just cancer.

1628
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000
It was like, hey, you can identify literally hundreds and hundreds of problems that you could have medically

1629
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
from a single pin prick of blood, which was just just completely not true.

1630
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Not true.

1631
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Just not true.

1632
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Now, going into more detail, that particular lab was federally regulated and qualified under a certain type of regulation through CMS.

1633
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
But they, but not through the FDA's regulations.

1634
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Okay.

1635
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
So eventually they were caught, right?

1636
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And that that's what it's for.

1637
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Like, that's what the regulation is for.

1638
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So it's still annoying, right?

1639
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
It we should have more tests for the coronavirus available.

1640
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
But our system was not designed to make that happen quickly.

1641
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
It should have been.

1642
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
I'm not saying there's not room for some lessons learned here and some change and we will make those changes actually.

1643
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
The administration frankly already has.

1644
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
So.

1645
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
But the only way to do it is to get the private sector involved and to give them the flexibility to do the test and then to,

1646
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
and then to streamline the FDA's testing of that test so that we know it's actually a decent test.

1647
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
You know, there was this.

1648
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
The point is, right?

1649
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Like, stop and think and wonder.

1650
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Be curious.

1651
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Like, is.

1652
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Is it true that a test is just a test?

1653
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Like, of course not.

1654
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Like, there's all different types.

1655
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It's a number.

1656
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
You know what I mean?

1657
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000
It's a summer lab, some of our test kits, like, someone were accurate then others.

1658
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Like, is it possible that it's more complicated than the headline is telling you?

1659
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Is it possible?

1660
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Is it just a little bit possible?

1661
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:28.000
You know, and again, when I say the media does such a disservice, it's because it's so, you know, you should have somewhat of a combat of media against government.

1662
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
You know, their point is a check in balance against government.

1663
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
But you would hope that their purpose would be to educate.

1664
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And that I believe that has changed radically.

1665
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I believe they don't longer view it as there is their duty to educate the public.

1666
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
They, they only see confrontation as their duty.

1667
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
And I don't find that to be a good service to the American people.

1668
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I would say that is an accurate statement.

1669
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.000
The news does that or has been doing that a lot though, even like regular local news, they do that where they'll.

1670
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
And but it's not you don't click on it, but it's the same concept when they say,

1671
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
You're is yourself own killing you.

1672
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
More ready, Levin.

1673
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
You know, so it's like, that's the clickbait right there.

1674
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
They've been doing that for a long time.

1675
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
And then yeah, then you, then you listen to it because you're like,

1676
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
It might be killing me.

1677
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Yeah, I listen to it.

1678
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And then it's like, Oh, yeah, you know, someone dropped their cell phone and it like made them,

1679
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
You know, do something they killed.

1680
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Do something to be like totally innocuous.

1681
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Yeah, yeah, deep bumps the headline.

1682
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Speaking of headlines.

1683
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Next chapter.

1684
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Sweat the small stuff. This chapter. This is the chapter I gave you permission to complain.

1685
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Permission to moan and grown about the nitty gritty small, but annoying ankle biting in conveniences.

1686
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
We face in our everyday lives.

1687
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Permission to gripe about even your smallest troubles.

1688
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Grumble about long lines at the drive through and wind about the imperfect weather.

1689
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I'm actually going to encourage it. You're welcome.

1690
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Okay, don't think me yet.

1691
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
There are certain ground rules.

1692
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000
One, sweating the small stuff is okay, but exercise your complaints lightheartedly.

1693
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Seek out humor in your whining, be humble, be self aware.

1694
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Two, if you're all, if you allow yourself to sweat the small stuff and I think you should,

1695
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Then you must also force yourself to be detail oriented.

1696
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Three, if you allow yourself to sweat the small stuff, then you must try your hardest not to sweat the big stuff.

1697
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
What are you talking about here?

1698
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:40.000
What actually kind of goes back to when you got a, I just restrained myself from moving to this chapter when you set it before.

1699
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
When you got a bunch of criticism, right?

1700
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
For saying, don't be emotional about stuff.

1701
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And people are like, well, you can't tell me that.

1702
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And then it makes the emotional, ironically.

1703
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But in your reaction was, okay, I'm not saying, be a robot.

1704
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
You know, I'm just saying, like, don't let it get the best of you.

1705
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
And so I really wanted to be like, oh my god, it's like my chapter about sweating the small stuff.

1706
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Because because of every time you're told, you know, oh, don't sweat the small stuff.

1707
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And I'm like, well, I don't know about that.

1708
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I think there's some venting that has to occur.

1709
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And I think we take it a little too far in the seal teams.

1710
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Oh yeah.

1711
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I mean, we complain about the smallest of things, but there's like, but I, and I examined that.

1712
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Like, this chapter is about examining that truth.

1713
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Why do we do that? Are we a bunch of divas?

1714
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yes. Yes.

1715
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But that is the, that is true. Two things going to occur.

1716
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
That's true.

1717
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Things can be true at once.

1718
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
We can be divas, but there's also a deeper reason and value to it.

1719
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
As long as you do it right.

1720
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And I try to examine that carefully in this chapter about what the right way is to complain.

1721
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And like I try to set some ground rules, like be funny.

1722
01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Being funny is a decent way to do things.

1723
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
It can't be too serious.

1724
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Like there's a difference between complaining about how crappy the coffee is at the command.

1725
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
And complaining about the actual command atmosphere to your guys.

1726
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
There's a, there's a big difference.

1727
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
From a leadership perspective, there's a difference there.

1728
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Like one can be kind of funny and just like, oh yeah, stupid, whatever.

1729
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Coffee's crap and the, the buildings stupid or whatever.

1730
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Like the same things people that the gym isn't hard enough.

1731
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
There's not enough weights because I'm stronger than whatever.

1732
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
You know, typical dumb team guy complaints.

1733
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
There's a difference as a leader.

1734
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
That's what the gym is complaints though.

1735
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yeah, especially.

1736
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yeah.

1737
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
No, I completely all the time.

1738
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Like, oh, because we're out of 45 pound plates.

1739
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
You know, my deadlift.

1740
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:55.000
But the, um, just as a leader, especially the big difference between that and being like our CEO is messed up.

1741
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yeah.

1742
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
That's, that's, this is one of the things I talk about leadership strategy and tactics is like,

1743
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000
If you are just white washing everything, this coffee is fantastic.

1744
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
And it sucks.

1745
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Your guys are starting to look at you going, okay, wait a second.

1746
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
You're, you're not real. And you think that you're, you're not questioning.

1747
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
You're not pushing back against anything.

1748
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
However, like you said, if you come down and you say,

1749
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
or commanding officers in the idiot, that's going to be problematic.

1750
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
So you got to, you got to be careful about what you're complaining about.

1751
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
To your point, complaining, forms some level of bond, right?

1752
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
That's one of the things that we do in the teams.

1753
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Yeah.

1754
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Like we're going to complain about the, the freaking birthing that we have.

1755
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And the this, that, the other thing.

1756
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And it's like, okay, cool, because we're all in the same team.

1757
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I'm playing about it. But if somebody starts complaining about things that matter

1758
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
at a more strategic level, now we got a problem.

1759
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000
The other part of the don't sweat the, the sweat, the small stuff mentality is the

1760
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Detailory Antipart. This is really important because one, being detailed,

1761
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Detailory Antid is an element of fortitude.

1762
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I would argue.

1763
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I think rather effectively.

1764
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
And I wrapped it into this chapter though.

1765
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And you can probably wrap the detail oriented mindset into many of the lessons in this

1766
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
chapter. But I put it into this one because if you're sweating the small stuff, then by definition,

1767
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
you work in certain about small things.

1768
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000
And it's not self-evident to me that being so chillax about all the stuff is a virtue.

1769
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And we sometimes see that as a virtue like like the big, I know like the, the dude from the big

1770
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
LeBouceking, that guy doesn't care about anything.

1771
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000
But is that good?

1772
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Well other than bowling.

1773
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
It's why Russians.

1774
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
He was pretty passionate about those things.

1775
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
That is true.

1776
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Another occasion, Harry.

1777
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000
But you know, it's like, you know, you're that, that cool kid in high school.

1778
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Who just like, let's everything roll off their back.

1779
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
You know, it's like the cool surfer dude.

1780
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I got it. I'm not saying there's no value in that.

1781
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
But it's not self-evident to me that that's what we should aspire to.

1782
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Because it's not obvious to me that that they're a highly productive people.

1783
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Maybe they are.

1784
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Not saying they can't be.

1785
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000
But if you're not concerned with small things, there's a pretty decent chance.

1786
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000
You're not concerned about bigger questions in life, about bigger elements of personal responsibility.

1787
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Or you, you might not be that motivated to, to move up the hierarchy that we talked about.

1788
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And so being concerned with the small stuff is, is a habit.

1789
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
It's an Aristotelian.

1790
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000
And the Aristotelian sense, we build good habits that that are, that are meant for a higher purpose.

1791
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
That's what makes them a good habit.

1792
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
We do it because it is good.

1793
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
And so that's the deeper thing here.

1794
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Yeah, complain a little bit.

1795
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Like, like, especially, you know, on the way.

1796
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I'm the way here.

1797
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
We're going down, uh, as at Midway Drive.

1798
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And, um, San Diego has often had this problem.

1799
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
And I've complained about it for a very long time, which is that the lights are not synchronized.

1800
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
They're not synchronized for traffic flow.

1801
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
The way like New York City is in Manhattan.

1802
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Those are well synchronized lights.

1803
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
One of my biggest pet peeves is the lights are not synchronized.

1804
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Because it's a solvable problem.

1805
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Might and too, but to synchronize the lights, you know, as a city manager or a mayor or a

1806
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
or a systemist.

1807
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And, uh, it's like, as I was going from red light to red light, trying to get to, to

1808
02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Jocco's podcast because I cannot be late because I just wrote in my book that I gave him

1809
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Don't be late.

1810
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
That was funny.

1811
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I was like, these different lights.

1812
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000
You know, and so, that my wife is like, I am so sick of hearing you can play in about the

1813
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
where she's like, she hates this chapter because she's so used to the seal team culture.

1814
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
She's like, why do you even write this?

1815
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Like, don't encourage this.

1816
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I'm like, I'm trying to encourage it to the right extent.

1817
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
You know, and because it is, I am walking a fine line for sure.

1818
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Um, and we're trying to, we're trying to, you know, reverse some, some commonly held beliefs.

1819
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
And, uh, it was a fun chapter to write.

1820
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
It was one of my favorite.

1821
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Yeah, and obviously you just met me that dichotomy of this is if you get so focused on

1822
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.000
little things, then you are wasting your time, you know, you're wasting your time.

1823
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
The, the, uh, mats on my personal home gym, my, our dirty.

1824
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000
And people say, you're, that's, you need to clean your mats.

1825
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000
What kind of discipline is that?

1826
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I'm like, look, I would have to spend an hour a day clean those mats to make them look

1827
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
clean.

1828
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Maybe even more than that.

1829
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I don't, I don't care.

1830
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
But it's my garage gym. There's chalk on the floor and sweat.

1831
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Yeah.

1832
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That's the way it is.

1833
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I'm not worried about it.

1834
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Yeah, and that's, that's a really good point too.

1835
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And it's, it's, well, it makes, especially makes sense in the, in the context of the dichotomy, right?

1836
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Right.

1837
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Right.

1838
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
And like, and I, and I hope that what I write there,

1839
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
helps people understand that there is a balance, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's operating in that gray area.

1840
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
So that you can focus on the big stuff because, you know,

1841
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000
seals like to complain about wet socks, like a lot.

1842
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I could say, and I, and I go into great detail about this.

1843
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And we avoid wet socks that, you know, to an extreme extent.

1844
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.000
But when, when things get really hard, you know, we, the complaining seems to stop.

1845
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.000
When things are really serious, we understand and have some perspective about that.

1846
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
And we, when we act accordingly.

1847
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And, uh, and I think that's perfectly relatable to regular life.

1848
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000
You know, it's, it's why we go, it's why we go and do happy hours after work.

1849
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
You know, you're just, you're blowing off some steam in a healthy way.

1850
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Why people go see a therapist.

1851
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Like, you're, you're really just, you're really just complaining to the therapists for an hour.

1852
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And that's, that's not a big thing.

1853
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
That's there.

1854
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
That goes so.

1855
02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Yeah.

1856
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
It's like, it's like, you're just kind of letting that steam out so that you're, you're, you're, you're,

1857
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
you're, you're holding tank of emotions doesn't explode in somebody's face.

1858
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And that's because that's how you lose an eye.

1859
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1860
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Uh, next chapter.

1861
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
The right sense of shame in America today, we too often look at personal feelings

1862
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
as things to overcome move past or forget.

1863
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Sometimes we should do one or all of those things, but we should also do something else.

1864
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Learn our lesson.

1865
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And we'll listen to public figures who run headlong and to self inflicted failure,

1866
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000
personal political or otherwise, and then reemerge shameless without having appeared to learn a thing is long.

1867
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Don't get me wrong.

1868
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I'll know opponent of redemption far from it.

1869
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I certainly believe there should be space for reemergement, reemergence from public sport.

1870
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Scorn.

1871
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I believe redemption is a trademark of an enlightened society.

1872
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
One of the most more detestable social trends now is mocking,

1873
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.000
is the mocking of redemption and the dismissing of the idea that it is possible or even desirable.

1874
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:56.000
In place of a system of repentance, justice, and mercy, we have a culture of mindless fury and outrage culture.

1875
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.000
So you, you, you've talked about this sense of shame, which is like a really important thing.

1876
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.000
And I, I looked at this from a team guy perspective, the amount of shame, like for instance,

1877
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
if you forget a piece of gear, you,

1878
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
when, when a guy in one of my platoons or my task you to make a mistake,

1879
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I almost never had to do anything other than simply very quietly acknowledge that that I saw.

1880
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I can't know you know.

1881
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
And they would take, crushed the shame would just drive them to never make that mistake again.

1882
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000
That's what you're talking about here that we've kind of lost that in a sense.

1883
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Like in a huge sense.

1884
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And in a huge sense, and then the other side of that is like, hey, just because you forgot something,

1885
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
doesn't mean I go, I don't want you in this platoon, you're a piece of shit.

1886
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
You can get, no, no, no, no, no, it's like, it's okay.

1887
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Hey, you made a mistake, you own it, you admit it, you tell me what you're going to do to fix it.

1888
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
And then we're back on the level and I'm, you know, we're ready to move forward,

1889
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
which we don't have.

1890
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And then of course, you go into this whole episode that took place with a,

1891
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
a comedian whose name is Pete Davidson.

1892
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Is this name?

1893
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Yep.

1894
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
So this guy, this guy is on Saturday night live one night.

1895
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And he says, they put a picture up of you.

1896
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And they put a bunch of, a bunch of politicians up there.

1897
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And then they put a picture of you up in this guy, Pete Davidson says,

1898
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
this guy is kind of cool.

1899
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
David's incorrect.

1900
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Dan Crenshaw.

1901
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
You might be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate from Texas

1902
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
and not a hitman in a porno.

1903
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
The audience, howled, or as the audience, howled,

1904
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Davidson jumped in with a quick aside.

1905
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I'm sorry.

1906
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.

1907
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
So, that happened.

1908
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Yeah, that happened.

1909
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I want to, in most people know that story by now.

1910
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I do give some behind the scenes never before heard elements to that story.

1911
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Yeah, it's good detail.

1912
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Which way you got to read the book.

1913
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000
But why is that in the shame chapters?

1914
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
The question, I think.

1915
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I want to hear your perspective on that whole thing too.

1916
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
First, because you told me a minute ago.

1917
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Yeah, you know, from my perspective, it looked like this.

1918
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Like this is just be clear, like during the election, when it all happened.

1919
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Because I was on your show last time well before, or never ever happened.

1920
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
No one knew who Dan Crenshaw was back then.

1921
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:40.000
When you first came on, when you first came on, no one really, you, you, you, you just started your character.

1922
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
That was early.

1923
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
And yeah, so it was early.

1924
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000
But now all the sudden man overnight, everybody knew who you were because of this.

1925
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And what happened was, from my perspective,

1926
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000
was people people started hitting me up on social media like,

1927
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Are you gonna, you know, denounce Saturday live?

1928
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And, you know, what did you think of this?

1929
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
And then they put the little thing in there.

1930
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
And, you know, of course, my kind of gut was like kind of funny.

1931
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
You know, I was like, like my response was like, kind of funny.

1932
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
I don't know that that made me laugh.

1933
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But here's the thing.

1934
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Luckily for me, I'm always behind on Twitter.

1935
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Like I'm not quite caught up.

1936
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And as I finally started what I was like, okay, I'm gonna respond to this right around then.

1937
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
And I was like, man, what do I, I'm like thinking of myself.

1938
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I don't think Dan is like crying over this.

1939
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I don't think he's at home going.

1940
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I can't believe that some comedian made fun of me.

1941
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Like, I'm thinking of it.

1942
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
But people are acting as if you were outraged.

1943
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
They were outraged for you.

1944
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And, you know, God bless him.

1945
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
It wasn't like they were bad people.

1946
02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
They were just offended by it, right?

1947
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
What we do now.

1948
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Yeah, they were offended by it.

1949
02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:01.000
And like you and I both know, I'm like, hey, man, that's something that probably has been said to him a hundred times in a platoon space somewhere.

1950
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
You know, like they're gonna make fun of you for everything.

1951
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:10.000
So anyways, when I finally responded, it was like, I think Dan can handle himself or something.

1952
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000
And I quoted you saying, hey, whatever your thing was like, hey, I'm not outraged.

1953
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It's fine.

1954
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000
He's literally a comedian in one to get on use the term literally in its right.

1955
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
The guy is literally a comedian.

1956
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
He's supposed to make fun of things and make people laugh.

1957
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
He's not doing political commentary.

1958
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
And it's not a personal attack on you for just him.

1959
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Just to attack you as a human being.

1960
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
He's trying to make people laugh.

1961
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
So that wasn't kind of my perspective.

1962
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000
It's funny how like when you're in a position like you are and I am in, you know, people like they hit you up on social media.

1963
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
It's almost like this challenging like you better do this or I'll never, never like you again.

1964
02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Or if you don't do what they want, I like to.

1965
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000
But now I can't trust you anymore.

1966
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
It's just funny how that works.

1967
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
So that's one element of it.

1968
02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000
But the, yeah, the hit me on an apporno thing was pretty funny.

1969
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Like that was, that is no idea.

1970
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I don't think that even pissed off anybody to be honest.

1971
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
It was the, it was the, the next comment, which was,

1972
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Yeah, I mean it was very dismissive.

1973
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
It was actually the whatever.

1974
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1975
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It was actually the whatever.

1976
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Yeah, yeah, if he hadn't said that, he wouldn't have received any backlash.

1977
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
If he would have said, I'm sorry, I know he lost his dying war.

1978
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
It would have been like that.

1979
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
You know what?

1980
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Okay, cool.

1981
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Yeah.

1982
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And then he said, or whatever.

1983
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Right, right.

1984
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
And it was a very dismissive tone.

1985
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And now, okay, so why is that in that chapter?

1986
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
And it's because of this.

1987
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:50.000
So the point is, is that the Saturday night live story was a story fundamentally about showing the right sense of shame and reaction to that.

1988
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
So because it could have gone a lot different.

1989
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Like I could have asked Jaco to be like denounced them for me.

1990
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
And they're like, okay, fine, Dan, Jay.

1991
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
God, being kind of a bitch by the way.

1992
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
And I could have actually stoked the outrage and just like played the agreed victim.

1993
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
And by the way, if you read left wing media these days, they'll say that's all the things I did.

1994
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
It's actually absurd how they rewrite history.

1995
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Oh, 100%.

1996
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
It's insane.

1997
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Like the lies that occur from left wing media or don't give me started.

1998
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I already started.

1999
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000
But okay, so that's not what happened.

2000
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Right?

2001
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I was like, my line was something along the lines of like, you know, in this life, like try or not to offend people, but also try really hard not to be offended.

2002
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
So, you know, it's kind of sucks what he said.

2003
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000
But now I'm not going to ask for him to be denounced or I don't want him to demanding an apology.

2004
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Be careful not to demand an apology.

2005
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I don't care if they apologize.

2006
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
It's like my life goes on either way.

2007
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
That's sort of how I stated that.

2008
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
And no, he shouldn't be fired.

2009
02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
People ask me like, should be fired.

2010
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Like no, like why, you know?

2011
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
And I'm remembering now you also said something along the lines of look.

2012
02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I'm not really offended, but you may have offended other people.

2013
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Like you, you kind of took a stance for other vets that have been wounded especially now.

2014
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Is it been more grievously wounded than you?

2015
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
That was the important line I had to walk on that entire reaction.

2016
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Because that's legitimate totally.

2017
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000
You can't kind of, you can't forgive the guy right off the bat.

2018
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
You have to acknowledge that he was screwed up.

2019
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:27.000
And, um, but on the other hand, you can also acknowledge that that he may have made a mistake.

2020
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Like he may have mispoke.

2021
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Like it may have been sort of ad libbed.

2022
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000
You know, because that is a very highly scripted show, but after working with Pete Davidson,

2023
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
like he kind of goes off the rails sometimes.

2024
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
And, uh, I mean, on the show or on the show.

2025
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
In life, both.

2026
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Okay.

2027
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Obviously.

2028
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000
But, uh, you know, so it's like, you know, always that it's kind of going back to be still like,

2029
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
is there a chance that there's more to this story?

2030
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Um, is there a chance I don't have to act like an agreed victim?

2031
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I don't feel like an agreed victim, so maybe don't act like it.

2032
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.000
And so that gave, that gave SNL the space to invite me on the show.

2033
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.000
If I had really stoked the outrage mob, um, why would they invite me on the show?

2034
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
You know, because now now I've put them in a corner.

2035
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And, uh, so you can see this going that way.

2036
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And this is how it usually goes, right?

2037
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
This kind of extreme sense of shame must be showed.

2038
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:27.000
And the extreme sense of, or the extreme outrage results in an extreme sense of shame.

2039
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
And so we've miscalabrated how we feel shame in this country.

2040
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
And that's a problem for our culture.

2041
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Um, and, and the reason Americans liked the whole SNL moment with me and Pete was because it was the right balance.

2042
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.000
So the right sense of shame is about finding the right balance of shame.

2043
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Because it seems like we have these like two options.

2044
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000
And I open up that chapter talking about all these politicians who,

2045
02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
who run headlong into failure and then like reemerge untouched or unrepent.

2046
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
And there's a lot of examples like that, okay?

2047
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And I try to have bipartisan examples by the way.

2048
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Uh, because I did want this to be readable to people of other than, you know, my conservative fan base.

2049
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:15.000
And, um, and the point is, is that, yeah, those politicians are bad people for basically feeling no shame.

2050
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.000
At the same time, our culture has given them no incentive to feel any shame.

2051
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Because the outrage mob is so severe and so unrelenting and so on for giving.

2052
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.000
That there's no incentive to actually react the way you should react.

2053
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
And so you end up just not either not apologizing or apologizing profusely.

2054
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:43.000
And like I actually, and the book actually, actually analyze this with some bell curves and graphs that I drew.

2055
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's just like illustrate this visually for people.

2056
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
So you just have to buy the book to see what I'm talking about.

2057
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Um, and what the point is is like, we need to get back to the middle ground where it's like,

2058
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
I'm kind of sorry, but I'm not really sorry.

2059
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
You know, and there's some good examples of that.

2060
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Like, I used to own the generous as a great example.

2061
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000
She took all this heat for like, you know, hanging out with George W. Bush at the Dallas Cowboys game.

2062
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.000
She didn't apologize. She wasn't like, you know, I didn't, she could have done like the extreme.

2063
02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Apology. I didn't realize how much pain I would cause the LGBTQ community.

2064
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
She could have said that, right?

2065
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
And you've seen other celebrities do similar things.

2066
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Like similar apologies. It's like, you've got nothing to apologize for.

2067
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Nothing.

2068
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
And she didn't apologize. She just kind of explained it.

2069
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
She got to just put people in their place.

2070
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Like, hey, like it's cool to hang out and be friends with people who you disagree with.

2071
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
And that was it.

2072
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
No, no, I do.

2073
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000
It was, it was, it was, it was, she diffused the situation rather, um, elegantly.

2074
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
And, um, I used a couple of other examples of some good ones too.

2075
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
But that's what we have to be aspiring to.

2076
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
And, um, and we're not there right now.

2077
02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
And then it gets into the, the chapter gets into the individual sense of shame.

2078
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Because this is that that's the cultural problem we have.

2079
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
That's the cultural outrage mob problem that I just described.

2080
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But there's a more individualistic sense of shame too about how you carry yourself through your daily life.

2081
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000
And, um, and how you have to feel bad about something if you're going to live your planet.

2082
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Like you have to know what it is and you have to understand right and wrong.

2083
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
You can only understand right and wrong if you understand what you should feel shame about.

2084
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And then I, and I get again into kind of a religious discussion here about like our morality and like how we actually know right from wrong.

2085
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000
This is, this is a, this is a deep thing to understand and how you should feel bad about certain things.

2086
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
If you're going to live the right way.

2087
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
And then again, we, we do this meticulously in the seal teams.

2088
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I think I have a story in there about, um, just a debrief from a typical seal chief.

2089
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And how that went. You know, we thought we did good. No, you did it.

2090
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
And you're going to feel bad about it.

2091
02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
And you have to make yourself feel bad about it.

2092
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
And that's, that's, that's the, that's the psychological reason.

2093
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:12.000
The psychological underpinnings of, of this chapter is, is you, a, a seal chief or Jaco can make you,

2094
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000
make you, no, you can, let, you can let them know that they screwed up right.

2095
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
But the question is, do you feel bad about it?

2096
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Most team guys do. Most team guys like it's just, it's hard to, to feel like you screwed up.

2097
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
But in the, in the outside world, that's not always the case.

2098
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
A lot of people are thinking, whatever, I should be being trouble.

2099
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I was going to say, since I was in a position where a lot of times I was debriefing people and telling them that they screwed something up.

2100
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
And the reactions were from a good, this is the difference.

2101
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000
You said, most team guys, good team guys go, ah man, I screwed that up.

2102
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000
I got to fix it. Bad team guys go, didn't really matter.

2103
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
That wouldn't have, that would never happen real world.

2104
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I would, you know, like they've got a million excuses.

2105
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
They don't take ownership of it, and they, and it just falls apart.

2106
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
They feel, they feel, no shame.

2107
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Exactly. They feel like, it's not my fault.

2108
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
It's, it's not on me.

2109
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And there's a rationalization that occurs.

2110
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And you have to, the only thing you can control is your conscious mind.

2111
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Because you can, you can control the conversation going on in your head about how you rationalize that.

2112
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:25.000
And the more you rationalize it, the less likely it is that you actually feel the shame in your gut.

2113
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Because because at first you feel it, like you know it was your fault.

2114
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
And you feel it, but then you rationalize it away.

2115
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000
And eventually that rationalization kind of takes over and you no longer even feel the shame in your gut.

2116
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And you're going out of very bad path at that point.

2117
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000
And again, this, this, this, try to relate this to a very basic stuff in life.

2118
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Like, like, don't you feel bad when you're that guy who kind of leaves the shopping cart in a parking spot?

2119
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Because you should.

2120
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Yeah.

2121
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
You're a bad person.

2122
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Bad person.

2123
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
You are.

2124
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Find a new one.

2125
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
You're a bad person.

2126
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
You're a bad person.

2127
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
You are.

2128
02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:58.000
You're a bad person.

2129
02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
You're a bad person.

2130
02:17:59.000 --> 02:17:59.000
You're a bad person.

2131
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
You're a bad person.

2132
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
You're a bad person.

2133
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
You're a bad person.

2134
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
You know, you did it.

2135
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Yeah.

2136
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
You know, you are.

2137
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
You're out there.

2138
02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Yeah.

2139
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
You say in here, we should feel a sense of shame for not training hard enough for sleeping

2140
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000
in too late for eating that extra scoop of ice cream.

2141
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
We should feel regret after walking by a piece of trash.

2142
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Next to storm drain knowing for where we'll go straight in the ocean.

2143
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
We should feel bad for not tipping that hard working waiter.

2144
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000
We should be embarrassed when we owe a friend money and they have to constantly remind us to pay them back.

2145
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
We should.

2146
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
We should.

2147
02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
We should.

2148
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.000
We should feel lazy for leaving our food tray on the table in a fast food restaurant, even though their trash cans are right there.

2149
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
You go on.

2150
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000
You say we should be insured be accountable for everything you do.

2151
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000
It was why commander Jocca Willink echo Charles.

2152
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000
One of my mentors in the teams wrote an entire book on the subject called Extreme Ownership.

2153
02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
The premise of the book is quite simple.

2154
02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Everything is your fault.

2155
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Be accountable.

2156
02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Take ownership.

2157
02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Take responsibility.

2158
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
From this responsibility.

2159
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
You will find freedom.

2160
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
It is liberating.

2161
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Really is.

2162
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000
It's liberating.

2163
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
The worst thing is trying to look and find who you're going to blame because then you don't have control over it.

2164
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.000
When you say you know what this is my fault, then you are free to go and make changes in your life.

2165
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Free to fix things.

2166
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:29.000
It's the deeper discussion about why personal responsibility is a bedrock of our cultural, of our culture and our cultural foundations.

2167
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000
As a conservative, we always say it.

2168
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I'm always like a personal responsibility.

2169
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000
In speeches, I try to delve into that a lot deeper.

2170
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
This is the argument for why it matters.

2171
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
It's quite simple.

2172
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Personal responsibility is empowering.

2173
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And lack of personal responsibility is disempowering.

2174
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:57.000
The other issue is it's completely unsustainable for a society to engage in a lack of personal responsibility.

2175
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:04.000
It's unsustainable because by definition, if you're not personally responsible, someone else must be responsible for you.

2176
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:11.000
And that's fine if you're an infant or you're in the, you know, it's a small segment of society, right?

2177
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
You can, you can, again, our, our government tries to take that into account.

2178
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:24.000
But if you encourage the undermining of the foundation itself, the undermining of personal responsibility as a virtue in and of itself, which is what's happening on the left.

2179
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:40.000
If you try to undermine that cultural foundation, you're creating an unbelievably unsustainable trajectory, where it is, where we, we have more and more people who are, who are convinced that somebody else should be responsible for them and therefore take their own power.

2180
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It's unbelievably disempowering and it's, it's just, you wouldn't wish that state of mind on anybody except your worst enemies.

2181
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You know, it's, again, it's not how you treat people you love.

2182
02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000
It's one of those things that's tempting, right? It's short-term gratification.

2183
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:04.000
It's, it seems like the easier way to go because in the short-term, hey, I just got this and I didn't have to work for it.

2184
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Yeah.

2185
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
That's the short-term.

2186
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And unfortunately, we know where it ends up.

2187
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
It's like a pyramid scheme.

2188
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Think about it.

2189
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:22.000
I'm thinking of it. I'm getting paid or whatever, because someone got to do the work at the end of the day.

2190
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:27.000
But a pyramid scheme, it's like everyone's waiting for their turn to like get, get.

2191
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2192
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
And then at the end of the day, everybody crashes because, oh, who's doing the work?

2193
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2194
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I mean, you can't remember. We're not doing anything.

2195
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000
That's right.

2196
02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
I think that that first, second year.

2197
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Yeah, that's right.

2198
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
My initial thought was trying to put it together, but yeah, you're right.

2199
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Because you're building it on everyone's going to get money.

2200
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Yeah.

2201
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
So is the money?

2202
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000
It's the money coming from. It's basically the diffusion of responsibility.

2203
02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000
This is what you're talking about and sort of the tragedy of the comments as well.

2204
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
It's going to be a mix of all those things.

2205
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
And it's not good.

2206
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
It's unsustainable.

2207
02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Next chapter, duty, a sense of duty.

2208
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:09.000
My parents imbueden me a sense of duty to do that, which has inherent value.

2209
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:19.000
You go on to say duty is ingrained in the human condition. Our great religious, our great religions are essentially based on a sense of duty to love God and live well.

2210
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:26.000
We have a duty not only to survive in this world, but to pursue a higher purpose we are here for a reason.

2211
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.000
And living for that purpose is our choice to make.

2212
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.000
It is the path to happiness.

2213
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:45.000
So again, we're starting to talk about the idea that you're going to find happiness in some short term gratification is not true.

2214
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:53.000
And this chapter comes right after the sense of shame chapter because you have to understand what is wrong,

2215
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
so that you can understand what is right.

2216
02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
And that is the darkness in the light and you have to live in both.

2217
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
And sense of duty is, it's living your plan A.

2218
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000
You know, and I said, don't live your plan B, no plan B. Again, that, what I explained before that was about purpose.

2219
02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.000
That's about living with purpose. And so we get into a lot more detail about what that is in this chapter.

2220
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:25.000
We talk about the great religions. We talk about why that's important.

2221
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:36.000
And then it's a duty to live in the books about mental toughness. And so we bring it back into it's a duty to live with that fortitude.

2222
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000
And again, to feel bad, this is deeply intertwined with the sense of shame, to feel bad when you don't.

2223
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000
To understand what that duty is and how to live within it.

2224
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000
And I can't remember if I list the ten commandments in this chapter or the other thing in the different chapter.

2225
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Yeah, but it's the same kind of discussion.

2226
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Oh, no, right. It is this chapter. It is this chapter.

2227
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:04.000
So then it's so that's when I get into a really long discussion about where our laws come from.

2228
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
So this kind of goes into political philosophy as well.

2229
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And the fact is, is that the ten commandments are the origins of our law.

2230
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And I talk about how Moses, the portrait of Moses, is in the house of representative,

2231
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000
and the figure of the house. And along with 23 other law givers, but Moses is in the middle.

2232
02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Moses is the only one who's not inside profile. That's important because he was the original receiver of law.

2233
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Not man made law, but like absolute law. These things are true.

2234
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Can't be argued with there. Just true.

2235
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
All right. Like the commandments one through four basically say, these are true.

2236
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
You can't argue with them. Like believe in God.

2237
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000
And the rest of them are like, this is what you should do.

2238
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
And don't steal, don't kill, all that.

2239
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000
And an atheist could say, I know that.

2240
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Yeah, I don't need the Bible to tell me that I shouldn't do these things.

2241
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I know they're true. My counter to that is how do you know?

2242
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000
How do you know? I could tell you who taught them.

2243
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Where did they get them from? How do you know they're true?

2244
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
And they can't answer that.

2245
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
They're true because they do come from a higher power.

2246
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000
They're true because they come from thousands of years of wisdom.

2247
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
And whether you believe in that higher power or not, you're still following it.

2248
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And you can't escape that reality.

2249
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:29.000
If you try to, and if you start to believe that that human morality is changeable,

2250
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.000
and that we can just choose that to change some of those commandments.

2251
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Well, then you get the Holocaust. Like it's a short path, man.

2252
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Like it's a short path to the horrors of the 20th century.

2253
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.000
The secularism of the 20th century killed millions, tens and tens of millions.

2254
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And because we untethered ourselves from absolute morality.

2255
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
It's a really dangerous path.

2256
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Yeah, when you talk about that and you end up saying at a very basic level,

2257
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
this is back to book at a very basic level.

2258
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
This is a shirking of fundamental human duty and responsibility,

2259
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.000
a responsibility to what exactly, politeness, open-mindedness and grace for starters.

2260
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
These are our duties to our fellow Americans.

2261
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Just the basics.

2262
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000
If we lose those fundamental virtues, we lose our sense of unity.

2263
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Without a sense of unity under unumbrella of common values,

2264
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000
this whole great American experiment unravels.

2265
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
And as you just said, we've seen this before.

2266
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Common values, exactly, and they come from somewhere.

2267
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000
A large part of this book is about showing gratitude for your history.

2268
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
Gratitude for what works.

2269
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:46.000
I like to say that, again, just being a conservative conservatism is based fundamentally on things that work.

2270
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Not things that feel good, but things that work.

2271
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And that's important. You know, doesn't mean we're always right,

2272
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
but most of the time, I think, at least the foundations are.

2273
02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000
And you can't just undermine the foundations of a society.

2274
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And see that happening more and more, unfortunately.

2275
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000
You rattle off some of these duties. You have a duty to accomplish something every day.

2276
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
You have a duty to live up to yourself, the person you want to be,

2277
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
the hero archetype you admire.

2278
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
You have a duty to embrace shame and learn from it.

2279
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
You have a duty to be polite, thoughtful, patient.

2280
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000
You have a duty to overcome your hardships and not wallowing self-pity.

2281
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
You have a duty to contribute.

2282
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Even if your contribution is small, you have a duty to be on time.

2283
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
You have a duty to do your job.

2284
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Even if your job sucks, you have a duty to stay healthy both for yourself.

2285
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000
And so you do, so that you do not become a burden on others.

2286
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
You have a duty to be part of the solution, not the problem.

2287
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
In other words, don't join the Twitter mob.

2288
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000
You have a duty to try hard not to offend others and try harder not to be offended.

2289
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And this is where you start broaching into what I was saying earlier.

2290
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000
There is a selfish reason to live a life of purpose and responsibility.

2291
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
It will make you tougher and more successful.

2292
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000
We are perfect and we won't always adhere to these basic duties.

2293
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:03.000
But I hope we can start to agree on what they are, feel some shame and we fall short,

2294
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
and begin living our lives with purpose.

2295
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000
This is the time-tested formula for stronger people and more than that, a stronger America.

2296
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
This is what people miss sometimes.

2297
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000
And I talk about this a lot from a leadership perspective.

2298
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000
From a leadership perspective, if I'm a leader that tries to climb on people's back,

2299
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000
tries to make myself look good, tries to always shine the line line on myself

2300
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
and find the best deal for myself.

2301
02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.000
If on that type of leader, I might get ahead for a second here there,

2302
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000
but ultimately I will not be in charge of anything.

2303
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000
If you're the type of leader that takes care of your troops, looks out for the good of the mission.

2304
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
You look out for everyone above yourself.

2305
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:49.000
If you're that type of leader, look, you might take hits now and again because you're propping up everyone else above yourself.

2306
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000
But in the long run, this is the amazing thing.

2307
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:59.000
In the long run, you will absolutely be a more successful leader than me who's over here looking out for myself.

2308
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000
And that's a similar thing to what you're saying here, which is like if you do these things,

2309
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000
which seem like sometimes they be a pain, getting up every day and being on time, taking care of your health.

2310
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Like all these things, maybe you don't feel being polite to people.

2311
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Sometimes you just want to do what I want to do.

2312
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000
That ultimately taking care of yourself and putting yourself as the supreme cause of your life.

2313
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Ultimately, you will be less successful than if you take care of other people.

2314
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.000
If you treat other people with respect, if you do your job, if you do those things that again on the surface,

2315
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:38.000
they seem like they might not help you in the long run, you will absolutely win.

2316
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Absolutely.

2317
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000
And when you win, your team wins, your community wins, your country wins.

2318
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
That's what happens.

2319
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Right.

2320
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And your individual actions and habits and tasks that are inherently good.

2321
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.000
We have to, again, we have to redefine what good is because we've forgotten.

2322
02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000
But that makes up the fabric of the larger culture.

2323
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:09.000
And if we want a successful culture that is not at each other's throats and not losing our minds because of microaggressions and offenses,

2324
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:17.000
then you've got to live within that. And yeah, treating other people to respect and doing things for others, again,

2325
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:27.000
very basic biblical teachings that are unfortunately being swept away, especially in favor of a kind of the sense of grandstanding and sense of morality,

2326
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
where it's more moral to demand that others do something for others.

2327
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000
You know, like that's, again, going back to the problems with socialism.

2328
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000
It seems to me that, because some socialists will sometimes say, well, Jesus was a socialist.

2329
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Now, Jesus encouraged you to be charitable with your time and your money.

2330
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Right.

2331
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.000
That's what Jesus said.

2332
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:52.000
He didn't say, stand on top of the hill, screaming that other people give away their money.

2333
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
That's not, sorry.

2334
02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:02.000
That's just, you're missing deliberately misinterpreting the teachings of the Bible in favor of socialism.

2335
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:09.000
There's a few other biblical reasons, I think socialism is not correct, but for our purposes on this chapter, that's a big one.

2336
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Sense of duty to give your time and your money and contribute that way.

2337
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:22.000
And it will make you more successful in the long run, because building good relationships is a huge part of success.

2338
02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
We forget about that sometimes.

2339
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I've drawn Peter's, it goes into a lot of detail in that particular element, which is fascinating to get an easy, big fan.

2340
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
And is he been on your show?

2341
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Three times.

2342
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:44.000
He was on before he was on before he was kind of popular before 12 rules for life came out.

2343
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000
And then he was on two times after that.

2344
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:53.000
And yeah, there are some of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

2345
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Until this one, of course.

2346
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Yeah.

2347
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Sure.

2348
02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Yeah.

2349
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
I'm sure.

2350
02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
100%.

2351
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Yeah.

2352
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
It's interesting because a lot of people, they make that mistake.

2353
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
How you're like, you have to have to do it.

2354
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Because people make that mistake with extreme ownership too.

2355
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Yeah.

2356
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Yeah.

2357
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000
But they're like, hey, if my boss would just get on board with this concept, you know, like, yeah,

2358
02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
that would be problems with my team would just take ownership.

2359
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Yeah.

2360
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
We're not talking about the same field.

2361
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And same thing with relationships.

2362
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:25.000
And I've been using the percentage lately of 99.9% of the things that I got done in the military.

2363
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.000
And did in the military were based on relationships and not based on chain of command.

2364
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:34.000
So every time one of my guys, you know, had a mission, I didn't, this is how you're going to do it.

2365
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
And I was like, hey, how do you want to get this done?

2366
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Every time my boss came to me, they want to like, hey, John, this is what you need to do.

2367
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
And they're like, hey, here's what we got.

2368
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
What do you think?

2369
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Everything was about relationships.

2370
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Every, every, the extreme examples in the battle of Ramadi when we needed fire support from tanks who needed to risk their lives to go and get my guys,

2371
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
prevent them from being overrun in the field.

2372
02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Well, those tanks didn't work for me.

2373
02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
They didn't, they weren't totally separate chain of command.

2374
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
And yet they would do it. Why?

2375
02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Because we had awesome relationships up and down the chain of command.

2376
02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:12.000
And so yeah, absolutely relationship building is, it's, it's critical to every aspect of life.

2377
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.000
And the little tagline that I often tell people is relationships are stronger than the chain of command.

2378
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
100%.

2379
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Yeah.

2380
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
100%.

2381
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Next chapter.

2382
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Do something hard.

2383
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000
In Buds, it's all about the next 10 minutes.

2384
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Sometimes it's about the next 30 seconds.

2385
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:34.000
If you're thinking about Buds in its entirety, six brutal months, then the thought is simply too much.

2386
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:39.000
The men who quit are the men who look up at the day before them and see all the days to come.

2387
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
They are thinking, they're the men who are miserable.

2388
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000
And what end called and thinking about the hot coffee and the girlfriend they miss.

2389
02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.000
And suddenly, because they imagine the months long suffering, they will inevitably face they break.

2390
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:58.000
They are already using every ounce of endurance and fortitude to survive what's happening right now.

2391
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Expanding their horizons to an infinite number of miserable right nows.

2392
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Does them in.

2393
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:12.000
So you focus on the next 10 minutes and remind yourself that the instructors can't kill you even if they're claiming otherwise.

2394
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Thousands have made it before you.

2395
02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000
You can too.

2396
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000
What's on the other side of those months and months of 10 minute blocks are over.

2397
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Liberation transformation and meaning.

2398
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000
So that's.

2399
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
That's one way to get through Buds.

2400
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Buds isn't six months long.

2401
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
It's about four minutes long.

2402
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Right now.

2403
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I want to get through it.

2404
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Lots of four minutes.

2405
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Lots and lots of them.

2406
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Or some longer for some of us if we extend our time by breaking a leg.

2407
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Some just not great, but also normal.

2408
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Yeah, normal.

2409
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
A lot of people get rolled back.

2410
02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000
They got to go back over and over again.

2411
02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:01.000
So how does this, how does this apply then to, you know, this is broad advice to human beings.

2412
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Yeah.

2413
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.000
So because I have everybody's going through Buds and Norshad Day.

2414
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000
And obviously, I'm using my own experiences here.

2415
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Like this was my transformation.

2416
02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Buds is a transformation for a lot of seals.

2417
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:24.000
It's what gives us confidence and you push your limits so that you way pass what you thought were there.

2418
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.000
So that your confidence enough to break past more limits when they come because they will come.

2419
02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000
And, you know, they came for me getting blown up.

2420
02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.000
That was a limit that I didn't quite experience even in Hellweek.

2421
02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
And it got worse because things can get worse.

2422
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:50.000
But Hellweek and Buds in general and the mentality that we developed, accordingly, at least allowed me to deal with it later.

2423
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And so doing something hard, it has a number of benefits.

2424
02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000
One is kind of a simple sense of preparedness.

2425
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000
And the Stoics, a reference Stoics, Stoicism a lot throughout the book.

2426
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:13.000
And the Stoics are referenced in this one because they, they believed in hardship as preparedness.

2427
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:20.000
So that's a very, that's a very practical reason to just do hard stuff.

2428
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.000
You know, if you're worried about being homeless one day, try to sit on the floor sometimes.

2429
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Like, try going a few days without the comforts of your home so that if it did happen, you'd actually be prepared for it.

2430
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:37.000
That's a very simplistic way of looking at it, but like that's what they meant by that simple preparedness.

2431
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:45.000
You know, if you want to be better at running up a mountain, run up a mountain like, you know, so the actor preparedness.

2432
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000
But there's a deeper reason why I think doing something hard matters.

2433
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.000
And it's the, it's the psychology of suffering.

2434
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000
And so this is a chapter that has a lot of psych references in it.

2435
02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I did a lot of research on this one specifically with kind of Dr. Allison from University of Richmond.

2436
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000
And the benefits of suffering are well documented.

2437
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Psychologically and physiological, physiologically speaking.

2438
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Interesting research that I, and we'll go into now, but because again, I want people to read it.

2439
02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And all of the people who come away from this podcast, but check, got it.

2440
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
You know, not buying that book now. Thanks, Jocco.

2441
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.000
So there's a lot more to it, but the suffering has inherent value.

2442
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And we've, we've created the society where we try to avoid suffering and risk at all costs.

2443
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000
And there's, it's not self-evident that that's a good thing.

2444
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
In fact, it's pretty evident that it's a bad thing.

2445
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
We've become more fragile as a result.

2446
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000
And again, there's good research that shows like we've become kind of this,

2447
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.000
this fragile culture. We need to be anti-fragile.

2448
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Heartship should make us stronger, not just that we're resilient to it, but that it actually makes us stronger.

2449
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000
This is fundamentally true.

2450
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Again, I think the, the Bible talks about this, the, or psychological research talks about this.

2451
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:13.000
There's, there's evidence that, you know, again, physiological pain, you know, working out.

2452
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.000
It changes your brain. It makes you better at memory.

2453
02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And if you're better at, like, if your brain works better, I would argue that you're mentally tougher.

2454
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000
So like, just, again, so start lifting weights, you know?

2455
02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000
And if you can't lift weights, like, find something else that is hard.

2456
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.000
So again, it's not buds.

2457
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And I'm not saying, lift or trauma either, okay? Like swimming with sharks is hard.

2458
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Like, don't go swim with sharks. That's bad.

2459
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:45.000
But, and, like, so I guess what I'm saying is, don't put yourself in a dangerous situation

2460
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000
where you'll have to live through a hardship and then overcome it.

2461
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Okay? That's not what I'm saying.

2462
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
I am saying it has to be self-imposed and it has to be habitual.

2463
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
And there's value in that.

2464
02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
And it could be simple, right? It could be taking a cold shower on weekends.

2465
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Like, I'm just going to, on weekends, I'm going to take cold showers.

2466
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
It could be waking up at 4.30 a.m.

2467
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Sorry.

2468
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I could play.

2469
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Yeah. I hate that plan.

2470
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000
But, but that's, that's like, but that's, there's a reason you do it, you know,

2471
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000
and, and for the sense of discipline, you're on the path. Like, this is, this is what you do.

2472
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
And it's different for everybody, but just find it.

2473
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000
And maybe make it harder the next time, you know?

2474
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000
But eventually, in your case, you would just be, never, I guess,

2475
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
what would that look like wake up earlier?

2476
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
No sleep.

2477
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Now you're just in the middle of the night.

2478
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
You're just like, you know, it's weird.

2479
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I'm thinking about, um, there'd be sometimes with team guys on operations

2480
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:47.000
where it goes, it goes past the normal everyday level of suck.

2481
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Like, it starts to suck bad.

2482
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Whatever it is, whether it's a long, long insert, you know,

2483
02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000
patrol in, whether it's the heat, whether it's the cold, whatever that thing is,

2484
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000
like, you will be, uh, I would say, one out of every eight,

2485
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.000
just standard kind of operations that you're going, one out of every eight.

2486
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000
You're going to have to go into that zone where you look around at the other guys

2487
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
and you're like, yeah, you're like, you know, like, you're up.

2488
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:21.000
This, everyone right here, everybody in this boat in this Zodiac,

2489
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
that is absolutely freezing right now.

2490
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
This sucks for everybody.

2491
02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
And you know what, it's just like, you're up.

2492
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
We're going to keep going.

2493
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
And it's like glorious.

2494
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
And then you look back on it later and you're like, that was amazing.

2495
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
And it makes you better.

2496
02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.000
And it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, really, there's a spiritual awakening that occurs with suffering,

2497
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
self-imposed suffering.

2498
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000
No doubt.

2499
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000
And, um, and, um, and, um, and also not self-imposed suffering.

2500
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I'm just saying, don't go seek out the, the, you know, what would be better to refer to as tragedy.

2501
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
But yeah, I'm not saying seek out for tragedy.

2502
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.000
But also, now, kind of, I would be jumping into the next chapter,

2503
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000
because sort of leads into it.

2504
02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000
But then you're telling yourself a story about the tragedy.

2505
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000
And there's still value in that. And again, this is backed up by research.

2506
02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Like, it, it did my homework on this.

2507
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000
There is, it, whether you call it post-traumatic growth,

2508
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
or, or, or kind of positive, I forget the other terms.

2509
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000
But there's, there's a, there's a bunch of terms, like a lot of psychology terms that,

2510
02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.000
that, that, that prove and, and demonstrate that people,

2511
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:27.000
not only become more resilient, but, but even stronger after really hard occurrences.

2512
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000
So don't run from it as a society we need to embrace it.

2513
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Yeah, I, no, no doubt in my mind. And we'll, let's jump to the next chapter.

2514
02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.000
But first, let me close this one out, because it's,

2515
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
here's what you say.

2516
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000
In the raw humanistic sense, without suffering, there can be no internal resilience to adversity.

2517
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000
No proper preparedness for the future.

2518
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Suffering controlled by you and for the right cause can be a building block for both spiritual,

2519
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000
health and mental toughness.

2520
02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000
In a liberty-based nation like the United States,

2521
02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:06.000
we are free to fail and to suffer that fortitude is a welcome and necessary attribute.

2522
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Rather than trying to erase suffering at every opportunity,

2523
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000
we would all be wise to value it and seek it out.

2524
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.000
So go do something hard.

2525
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.000
And so this next chapter, which you are just alluding to,

2526
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000
is called the stories we tell ourselves.

2527
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.000
You say, you could tell the story of my life as a succession of hard times and heavy burdens.

2528
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:39.000
You could tell it as an array of kicks to the head, interspersed with failures.

2529
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.000
My mom died, my leg broke, my eye got blown out, my active commission got taken away,

2530
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000
my fellowship application got denied.

2531
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000
All these things are factually accurate.

2532
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
They happened, I endured them.

2533
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.000
That is where a lot of people would leave it.

2534
02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000
These are things that happened to them from forces beyond their control,

2535
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:05.000
leaving it here, leaving it there communicates a handful of ideas about someone.

2536
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000
He's unfortunate, he's unlucky, he's beaten, he's evictum.

2537
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000
That is not where people should leave it.

2538
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Stories about burdens born on their own omit the most important parts,

2539
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000
the responsibility of the individual.

2540
02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:27.000
The reaction of the individual, the growth and maturing of the individual.

2541
02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000
The world does something to you because it will always do something to you,

2542
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.000
but once it's done, that share of the story is over.

2543
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000
That is where your share of the story begins.

2544
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:50.000
That's the point where the story stops being something done to you and starts being about you.

2545
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000
You go into, we talked about your mom dying, but you mentioned your leg,

2546
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
you get in bloom.

2547
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.000
There's a lot of things that you have a lot of what do you call him.

2548
02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Hard times heavy burdens and failures that you talk about in the book that we haven't even touched.

2549
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Again, that's why people get the books that they can learn those lessons and see what you went through there.

2550
02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.000
But also see this, this is now getting towards the end of the book.

2551
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000
When you're starting to tie this stuff together and say, hey listen,

2552
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.000
you were in a bad situation.

2553
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000
What are you going to do in the face of those bad situations more poignantly?

2554
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000
What is the story that you tell yourself?

2555
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Yeah, and in turn throughout this book is a particular thread about victimhood ideology.

2556
02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And how that pertains to outraged culture.

2557
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:44.000
I would argue that victimhood ideology is a tenant of outraged culture.

2558
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:53.000
It's not surprising that you feel really mad and offended and angry and outraged if you also feel like you're oppressed.

2559
02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000
If you also feel like you're a victim and you embrace that victimhood.

2560
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000
This isn't all that surprising either.

2561
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.000
It's expected because going back to the hero archetypes, we've elevated victims.

2562
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Why would Jesse Smallet pretend and make up the story that he got attacked by two maga hat wearing guys and Chicago at 2am?

2563
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Why would he make that up?

2564
02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Because we've elevated victims to heroes.

2565
02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Like that's why why does Elizabeth Warren claim the lies that she's claimed about being Native American or that she was fired for being pregnant?

2566
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000
These are lies. They're well documented lies.

2567
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.000
You know what's interesting is I'm just thinking of the, what's it?

2568
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Is it Jesse?

2569
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Jesse.

2570
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I'm thinking about that guy's story.

2571
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:47.000
If you were to go back 20 years and someone was going to make up a story, the story that they would make up would be,

2572
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000
I got attacked by two guys and I kicked their ass.

2573
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Yes.

2574
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
That's really important to me.

2575
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000
It's crazy.

2576
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
The way I, but that's exactly what I'm talking about.

2577
02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:08.000
It's like that's our hero archetypes have shifted so wildly that the more likable story is getting your ass kicked and then complaining about it.

2578
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000
As opposed to like, no, I just whip their ass.

2579
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:19.000
That's a perfect point to make and like, that's why I start the book with who is your hero because it's such an important concept.

2580
02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000
And in this case, it's like, can I let you know who your hero is?

2581
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Well, then you should identify how you react to hardship.

2582
02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Not saying hardship doesn't exist.

2583
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.000
You know, when I bash victimhood ideology, I'm not saying there are no victims.

2584
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.000
It is possible that you truly are a victim.

2585
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Absolutely.

2586
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:47.000
But, you know, but one that should be defined, like in just the word injustice needs to be defined better so that we can overcome outrage culture.

2587
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000
And in just this doesn't mean things that aren't fair or things that you don't like.

2588
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Unfortunately, that's how the word is used all too often.

2589
02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.000
And just this means someone else is truly infringing on your rights.

2590
02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Rights defined as life liberty and property.

2591
02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.000
And justice can be defined as is as is as you're due process being taken away.

2592
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Something some true unfairness or discrimination being implemented against you.

2593
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.000
That can be defined as injustice, okay?

2594
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:19.000
An outcome based on something other than your merit can be defined as an injustice.

2595
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.000
But, but victimhood ideology really turns these, it really strains these definitions.

2596
02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
And I think people understand, know this intuitively.

2597
02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Just watch the news and watch how people are reacting on social media.

2598
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
This is a really big problem that prevents us from telling the right stories about injustice.

2599
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000
And then solving it and overcoming it.

2600
02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.000
We've been encouraged to live in the story of victimhood when something bad happens.

2601
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.000
And that may feel good, again, it goes back to what you're saying before.

2602
02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.000
This sort of short term thinking, it feels good in the short term, right?

2603
02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:56.000
It feels like it's somebody else's fault.

2604
02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:00.000
And there's a comfort in that. There's like a warm blanket of self-pity that occurs.

2605
02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Like that.

2606
02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:12.000
But it's also, it's, it's, you could almost say quite literally killing you because it leads you down this path of despair that ends in not a good place.

2607
02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:19.000
If you always feel this, your things are out of your control and your disempower and it literally cannot get better.

2608
02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000
You cannot get better.

2609
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:24.000
One of the questions that I get asked a lot when working with companies.

2610
02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.000
They'll say, you know, what's the biggest obstacle for having a culture of extreme ownership?

2611
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:36.000
And it's really easy answer. The answer is that it is ego because when something goes wrong and you have to say,

2612
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Hey, this is my fault. Well, that hurts your ego.

2613
02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.000
And that's the biggest thing that people have to overcome.

2614
02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Now, the other thing that that's interesting is, and you address this here.

2615
02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000
So the other, the other question I'll get asked a lot when it comes to extreme ownership.

2616
02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:59.000
And I've kind of already mentioned it. You know, is, hey, if my kid gets sick, how do I take ownership of that?

2617
02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000
If I get cancer, how do I take ownership of that?

2618
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:06.000
If the market falls apart and we lose all of the money, I have to let people go,

2619
02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000
how do I take ownership of the, of the market?

2620
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.000
How do I take ownership of a natural disaster that occurred, right?

2621
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.000
So there's, get, I get asked that question.

2622
02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000
And the response is, you take ownership of how you,

2623
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:26.000
how you respond to that occurring, right? When something bad happens.

2624
02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000
And you, you, you, you go through the same thing here.

2625
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:36.000
You say, even if I was not totally responsible for what happened,

2626
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.000
I was still responsible for what would happen.

2627
02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000
And this is after you got, after you got removed from the Navy.

2628
02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Then they, they, they, they didn't kick you out of what they forced you to retire, right?

2629
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Yeah. They forced you retire. Look.

2630
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.000
That, that, that's, that's just happening to you.

2631
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Like the big blue Navy is going, you're done.

2632
02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Yep. And you can't control it.

2633
02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000
And so how do you take ownership of that?

2634
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000
You, you take ownership by how you respond to that.

2635
02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And what you say is you, trying to find your next mission.

2636
02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Right. You can control the next step.

2637
02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:16.000
There's another important point here that I, that I lay out,

2638
02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.000
which is the way you describe your history.

2639
02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000
This is important is putting yourself in the right psychological framework.

2640
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000
And we call those get to statements.

2641
02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Like, I have to wear an eye patch or I get to wear an eye patch.

2642
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
You know, because it looks cool.

2643
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
So that's nice.

2644
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
All right, get to wear the gold tried and tie.

2645
02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Because it looks cool.

2646
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
But you can go much deeper than that.

2647
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Like, I, you know, in, in some of the, to an extent,

2648
02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
this is self deception, right?

2649
02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.000
And, and you know that consciously going, going into it.

2650
02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Like, in, because I use another example, like, well,

2651
02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.000
I, I have to pay my bills or get to pay my bills.

2652
02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Because it shows that I'm an adult.

2653
02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
And I'm living responsibly.

2654
02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000
I have to pay taxes or I get to pay taxes.

2655
02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000
That one's harder.

2656
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000
That one's staying.

2657
02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000
That one's staying.

2658
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Especially if living California.

2659
02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Yeah.

2660
02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
You guys all you do is pay taxes.

2661
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Yes, we do.

2662
02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Well, you don't pay taxes.

2663
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
And they're not even synchronizing the lights.

2664
02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Because if you get to pay taxes, that means that you've made enough money.

2665
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Yeah.

2666
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.000
To pay taxes.

2667
02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000
So it's like, yeah.

2668
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:23.000
It's like one way to do it.

2669
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
And in a, in a, in a, in a different country, by the way.

2670
02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Yeah.

2671
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.000
I mean, it, it's, you know, fundamentally what you're doing there is finding the silver lining.

2672
02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Because the finding the silver lining in a bad situation is fundamentally

2673
02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.000
about telling yourself a different story about that situation.

2674
02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:41.000
And so it's, it's not whistling past the graveyard.

2675
02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:46.000
If you already know it's not ignoring the actual hardship,

2676
02:51:46.20 --> 02:51:49.16
it's just forcing yourself to have the fortitude

2677
02:51:49.16 --> 02:51:51.52
to tell yourself the right story about it.

2678
02:51:51.52 --> 02:51:55.44
That's what the chapter is fundamentally about.

2679
02:51:55.44 --> 02:51:59.000
Yeah, it's one of those things.

2680
02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.76
You read through it and you go,

2681
02:52:01.96 --> 02:52:05.52
yeah, this is the attitude that you would want a kid to have.

2682
02:52:05.52 --> 02:52:07.28
You know, you close it out here 20 years ago,

2683
02:52:07.28 --> 02:52:09.72
I received a letter in the mail from Rice University.

2684
02:52:09.72 --> 02:52:11.04
The letter might as well have been addressed,

2685
02:52:11.04 --> 02:52:14.36
dear failure, because it was indeed a letter informing me

2686
02:52:14.36 --> 02:52:15.92
that my services were not required

2687
02:52:15.92 --> 02:52:17.20
at the prestigious school.

2688
02:52:17.20 --> 02:52:18.88
I failed to get in.

2689
02:52:18.88 --> 02:52:21.32
20 years later, I became the US congressman

2690
02:52:21.32 --> 02:52:24.68
who represents Rice University.

2691
02:52:24.68 --> 02:52:28.16
The path from that failure to my present day success

2692
02:52:28.16 --> 02:52:29.60
was not an easy one.

2693
02:52:29.60 --> 02:52:32.08
Many more obstacles and failures would present themselves.

2694
02:52:32.08 --> 02:52:35.76
Every day each against a small obstacle,

2695
02:52:35.76 --> 02:52:38.92
against each small obstacle, I had to tell the right story

2696
02:52:38.92 --> 02:52:43.000
in order to stay on the path through self fulfillment.

2697
02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Failure like suffering has intrinsic value and worth

2698
02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.72
should we choose to confront it properly?

2699
02:52:51.64 --> 02:52:54.36
Otherwise, the ultimate story of success,

2700
02:52:54.36 --> 02:52:59.000
whatever that may be for you will never get told.

2701
02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:03.84
The other element here, I don't go into that much detail,

2702
02:53:03.84 --> 02:53:06.68
but it's an answer I give when,

2703
02:53:06.68 --> 02:53:10.48
especially kids ask how to deal with hardship.

2704
02:53:10.48 --> 02:53:14.04
And I like to point out that every obstacle is an opportunity.

2705
02:53:14.04 --> 02:53:15.40
And that sounds kind of cliche,

2706
02:53:15.40 --> 02:53:17.48
but it's really not, it's true.

2707
02:53:17.48 --> 02:53:20.68
I wouldn't be a congressman if I hadn't gotten my eye blown out.

2708
02:53:20.68 --> 02:53:21.52
This is true.

2709
02:53:21.52 --> 02:53:22.76
I would have stayed in the teams.

2710
02:53:22.76 --> 02:53:23.76
I never would have left.

2711
02:53:23.76 --> 02:53:24.88
I had no reason to leave.

2712
02:53:24.88 --> 02:53:26.60
It was not, I thought, very hard not to leave.

2713
02:53:26.60 --> 02:53:27.44
Best job ever.

2714
02:53:27.44 --> 02:53:28.24
Why would you leave?

2715
02:53:28.24 --> 02:53:29.56
Yeah.

2716
02:53:29.56 --> 02:53:33.84
And if I hadn't had been so many things,

2717
02:53:33.84 --> 02:53:38.84
I'd talk about, you know, gotten eye to this cool White House fellowship.

2718
02:53:38.84 --> 02:53:42.08
If I had gotten that, it wouldn't be a congressman.

2719
02:53:42.08 --> 02:53:45.28
You know, so technically that's a failure,

2720
02:53:45.28 --> 02:53:48.68
but, you know, you also, also it's not.

2721
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:50.72
When did you go for that fellowship?

2722
02:53:50.72 --> 02:53:51.72
Right after Harvard.

2723
02:53:51.72 --> 02:53:52.56
Right after Harvard.

2724
02:53:52.56 --> 02:53:55.52
Or Harvard was right after the Navy for one year,

2725
02:53:55.52 --> 02:53:57.60
applied for that, didn't get it.

2726
02:53:57.60 --> 02:53:59.24
You applied for the White House fellowship?

2727
02:53:59.24 --> 02:54:00.08
Right.

2728
02:54:00.08 --> 02:54:00.72
And you didn't get it.

2729
02:54:00.72 --> 02:54:01.56
Didn't get it.

2730
02:54:01.56 --> 02:54:02.68
And then you're like, okay, cool.

2731
02:54:02.68 --> 02:54:04.36
Can't beat him join him?

2732
02:54:04.36 --> 02:54:05.56
Well, no.

2733
02:54:05.56 --> 02:54:06.84
So, Rand for Congress,

2734
02:54:06.84 --> 02:54:09.28
because now I control the funding for the White House fellowship.

2735
02:54:09.28 --> 02:54:10.12
Yeah.

2736
02:54:10.12 --> 02:54:10.96
Yeah.

2737
02:54:10.96 --> 02:54:12.96
That's right.

2738
02:54:12.96 --> 02:54:13.96
Naval Academy didn't like it.

2739
02:54:13.96 --> 02:54:14.80
I guess it was.

2740
02:54:14.80 --> 02:54:16.24
It actually can't join him beat him.

2741
02:54:16.24 --> 02:54:17.08
I guess it was.

2742
02:54:17.08 --> 02:54:19.28
Yeah, I definitely didn't join them.

2743
02:54:19.28 --> 02:54:20.08
Don't break your go.

2744
02:54:20.08 --> 02:54:21.72
You didn't get it in the Naval Academy either.

2745
02:54:21.72 --> 02:54:22.56
No.

2746
02:54:22.56 --> 02:54:25.000
Didn't get it into the Naval Academy.

2747
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.56
Rejected.

2748
02:54:26.56 --> 02:54:28.76
I'm not going to defund the Naval Academy.

2749
02:54:29.96 --> 02:54:31.04
But.

2750
02:54:31.04 --> 02:54:34.04
But.

2751
02:54:34.04 --> 02:54:35.44
But no, I didn't get in.

2752
02:54:35.44 --> 02:54:36.24
And what if I had?

2753
02:54:36.24 --> 02:54:36.60
I don't know.

2754
02:54:36.60 --> 02:54:38.76
Maybe I wouldn't have even made it to buzz.

2755
02:54:38.76 --> 02:54:40.32
You know, you could argue, you know,

2756
02:54:40.32 --> 02:54:42.12
just different selection process.

2757
02:54:42.12 --> 02:54:43.20
Like there's all these.

2758
02:54:43.20 --> 02:54:45.16
You want to hear a little story that I tell myself,

2759
02:54:45.16 --> 02:54:47.68
whenever I get some kind of like little injury,

2760
02:54:47.68 --> 02:54:50.60
even if it's like a more significant injury,

2761
02:54:50.60 --> 02:54:52.88
maybe something that's going to make take me out of

2762
02:54:52.88 --> 02:54:55.48
off my training schedule for a month, right?

2763
02:54:55.48 --> 02:54:57.80
Her, my knee, her, my shoulder or something.

2764
02:54:57.80 --> 02:55:00.80
I always tell myself that that was

2765
02:55:00.80 --> 02:55:06.24
the greater powers way of getting me to not train

2766
02:55:06.24 --> 02:55:08.40
because the next day I was really going to get her.

2767
02:55:08.40 --> 02:55:08.80
Yeah.

2768
02:55:08.80 --> 02:55:09.80
The next day I was really going to.

2769
02:55:09.80 --> 02:55:10.60
That's all.

2770
02:55:10.60 --> 02:55:11.60
So I'm just like, OK, cool.

2771
02:55:11.60 --> 02:55:14.64
That's God's way of telling me, I'm not supposed to train

2772
02:55:14.64 --> 02:55:16.80
right now because otherwise I was going to break my neck

2773
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:17.84
or something.

2774
02:55:17.84 --> 02:55:18.92
So we're just going to.

2775
02:55:18.92 --> 02:55:19.44
That's right.

2776
02:55:19.44 --> 02:55:20.04
That's the story.

2777
02:55:20.04 --> 02:55:21.64
I tell myself sometimes.

2778
02:55:21.64 --> 02:55:24.72
I think it's a, I mean, it's not a joke.

2779
02:55:24.72 --> 02:55:26.32
I think it's a real.

2780
02:55:26.32 --> 02:55:28.44
I believe in that kind of stuff, honestly.

2781
02:55:28.44 --> 02:55:32.08
I believe that some things happen for a reason.

2782
02:55:32.08 --> 02:55:35.000
It's up to you to actually react to it appropriately.

2783
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.48
But I don't know.

2784
02:55:36.48 --> 02:55:38.000
I actually do believe in that.

2785
02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.28
And I think that comes out in this chapter.

2786
02:55:41.28 --> 02:55:43.000
So next time.

2787
02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.36
All right.

2788
02:55:43.36 --> 02:55:45.56
Next chapter, you went from the personal story.

2789
02:55:45.56 --> 02:55:47.60
Now we're talking about the story of America.

2790
02:55:47.60 --> 02:55:50.84
This is chapter 10.

2791
02:55:50.84 --> 02:55:54.24
The individual stories we tell ourselves, not just about our hardships,

2792
02:55:54.24 --> 02:55:57.68
but about who we are, combined to create our American story.

2793
02:55:57.68 --> 02:56:01.60
Every one of us adds a small thread to the larger fabric of our culture.

2794
02:56:01.60 --> 02:56:06.32
And as we change and evolve, so do our cultural norms.

2795
02:56:06.32 --> 02:56:08.80
The American story itself evolves.

2796
02:56:08.80 --> 02:56:10.60
This isn't a bad thing either.

2797
02:56:10.60 --> 02:56:14.68
It is natural and constant throughout history.

2798
02:56:14.68 --> 02:56:17.16
But something is changing for the worse.

2799
02:56:17.16 --> 02:56:20.92
The American story itself is being threatened.

2800
02:56:20.92 --> 02:56:24.88
Our cultural fabric has often changed and evolved,

2801
02:56:24.88 --> 02:56:28.12
but it has never been irreparably torn.

2802
02:56:28.12 --> 02:56:31.08
The close to we ever came was a civil war.

2803
02:56:31.08 --> 02:56:33.84
I suggest you that the latest threat to our American story

2804
02:56:33.84 --> 02:56:37.16
is outrage, culture, identity politics, and victimhood

2805
02:56:37.16 --> 02:56:40.48
ideology that it elevates.

2806
02:56:40.48 --> 02:56:42.72
The threat is born of small beginnings as big threats.

2807
02:56:42.72 --> 02:56:45.76
So often, it starts with toxic personal narratives,

2808
02:56:45.76 --> 02:56:50.92
wrapped in cheap cloth of victimhood, always looking to an external

2809
02:56:50.92 --> 02:56:56.16
culprit to blame for real or perceived injustices.

2810
02:56:56.16 --> 02:57:01.16
So this is the direction you fear that we are heading right now.

2811
02:57:01.16 --> 02:57:04.44
I think we're there.

2812
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:06.000
So pessimistic.

2813
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.44
Well, it's just, well, I'll tell you one thing.

2814
02:57:08.44 --> 02:57:09.44
I don't need to talk to you, right?

2815
02:57:09.44 --> 02:57:14.48
Well, I was going to say, I was just like when I was with Ben Shapiro.

2816
02:57:14.48 --> 02:57:17.04
And I just went up and talked to Candace Owens.

2817
02:57:17.04 --> 02:57:23.28
And they live at Ground Zero for interacting with crazy people.

2818
02:57:23.28 --> 02:57:26.88
I mean, and you're not quite as big.

2819
02:57:26.88 --> 02:57:29.76
It becomes all you see and you get a little bit more pessimistic.

2820
02:57:29.76 --> 02:57:30.76
Exactly.

2821
02:57:30.76 --> 02:57:35.32
And I'm really lucky because I work with a bunch of different companies,

2822
02:57:35.32 --> 02:57:38.40
all over the country, and work with every different type of company,

2823
02:57:38.40 --> 02:57:40.40
and work with all levels inside of a company.

2824
02:57:40.40 --> 02:57:44.72
So I'm not just out there only talking to the CEOs and the C-suite.

2825
02:57:44.72 --> 02:57:48.12
I'm also out there talking to frontline troops, communicating with them,

2826
02:57:48.12 --> 02:57:49.48
talking to what problems they have.

2827
02:57:49.48 --> 02:57:51.76
So we really get to see everyone at National Front.

2828
02:57:51.76 --> 02:57:58.36
We really get to see the pulse of not only of America over a large span,

2829
02:57:58.36 --> 02:58:02.72
but at a bunch of different socioeconomic levels,

2830
02:58:02.72 --> 02:58:04.76
and in a bunch of different industries.

2831
02:58:04.76 --> 02:58:11.76
Whereas, I mean, Candace and Ben, like, they go to,

2832
02:58:11.92 --> 02:58:13.92
they go to speak at colleges.

2833
02:58:13.92 --> 02:58:15.16
That's kind of what they do.

2834
02:58:15.16 --> 02:58:16.000
You know?

2835
02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.20
And you're not going to run into the same type of people,

2836
02:58:20.20 --> 02:58:23.08
but I'm going to run into that's working on a construction site

2837
02:58:23.08 --> 02:58:26.32
or in a manufacturing plant in Iowa.

2838
02:58:26.32 --> 02:58:28.16
No, you're sure not.

2839
02:58:28.16 --> 02:58:30.96
I do the same thing.

2840
02:58:30.96 --> 02:58:34.24
I've been pleasantly surprised to be perfectly honest with you.

2841
02:58:34.24 --> 02:58:36.52
Even when I go to colleges and especially high schools,

2842
02:58:36.52 --> 02:58:38.64
I think the questions are good.

2843
02:58:38.64 --> 02:58:42.84
If there's disagreement, it's been good.

2844
02:58:42.84 --> 02:58:44.08
Yeah, actually now that you mentioned,

2845
02:58:44.08 --> 02:58:45.92
I go and talk at colleges sometimes too.

2846
02:58:45.92 --> 02:58:50.08
And you mentioned, you know, you were talking about the kind of crowd

2847
02:58:50.08 --> 02:58:54.72
that comes in to see, the kind of crowd that comes in to see Candace Owens

2848
02:58:54.72 --> 02:58:56.40
or Ben Shapiro.

2849
02:58:56.40 --> 02:58:57.72
Sure, there's people that want to see them

2850
02:58:57.72 --> 02:58:59.24
that have like a concerned viewpoint,

2851
02:58:59.24 --> 02:59:02.08
but they probably attract at least as many

2852
02:59:02.08 --> 02:59:04.76
if not more lunatics.

2853
02:59:04.76 --> 02:59:05.48
They do.

2854
02:59:05.48 --> 02:59:08.68
And it's, I've seen it happen less over time,

2855
02:59:08.68 --> 02:59:13.68
also because Ben and Candace and Charlie Kirkday

2856
02:59:14.68 --> 02:59:16.000
that is kind of what they're looking for

2857
02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.24
because they want the debate to happen on camera.

2858
02:59:18.24 --> 02:59:20.72
I personally enjoy it too.

2859
02:59:20.72 --> 02:59:25.12
Like I want people in the left to come and debate me.

2860
02:59:25.12 --> 02:59:27.16
And I'm going to, that's what I want.

2861
02:59:27.16 --> 02:59:29.20
It's one of the reasons I'm doing it.

2862
02:59:29.20 --> 02:59:30.96
If it's just a bunch of people there agreeing with me,

2863
02:59:30.96 --> 02:59:34.92
then I'm not making a lot of progress.

2864
02:59:34.92 --> 02:59:36.96
It's really just a rally at that point.

2865
02:59:36.96 --> 02:59:39.88
And there's value in that too, but we are going there

2866
02:59:39.88 --> 02:59:41.72
for the confrontation.

2867
02:59:41.72 --> 02:59:45.000
I just wanted to be respectful and fact-based.

2868
02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:46.60
And it's not always that way.

2869
02:59:46.60 --> 02:59:48.12
I've had some interesting experiences

2870
02:59:48.12 --> 02:59:51.08
where it's just it just devolved into emotional ramblings.

2871
02:59:51.08 --> 02:59:55.32
But I've felt so that's some really interesting public debates.

2872
02:59:55.32 --> 02:59:57.80
And like that's kind of a usual for a politician to do.

2873
02:59:57.80 --> 03:00:00.32
See, that's the Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro model.

2874
03:00:00.32 --> 03:00:01.68
It's unusual for a politician to do

2875
03:00:01.68 --> 03:00:04.04
because we can get in so much more trouble doing it.

2876
03:00:04.04 --> 03:00:05.08
Because it's dangerous.

2877
03:00:05.08 --> 03:00:07.20
It's, you don't know how that's going to go.

2878
03:00:07.20 --> 03:00:09.72
People setting up ambushes on you have got your moment.

2879
03:00:09.72 --> 03:00:10.72
Right.

2880
03:00:10.72 --> 03:00:13.88
And so just be prepared for it and you'll be fine.

2881
03:00:13.88 --> 03:00:15.56
Know what you're talking about.

2882
03:00:15.56 --> 03:00:16.88
So I do it.

2883
03:00:16.88 --> 03:00:21.000
But I enjoy it quite a bit.

2884
03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.88
So the back to the original question,

2885
03:00:23.88 --> 03:00:27.24
which is, are we there as a culture?

2886
03:00:27.24 --> 03:00:30.52
Any answer is kind of like, it's worse than it used to be.

2887
03:00:30.52 --> 03:00:31.76
How about that?

2888
03:00:31.76 --> 03:00:34.32
Whether we're in a disaster area right now

2889
03:00:34.32 --> 03:00:37.28
with respect to victimhood ideology and identity politics.

2890
03:00:37.28 --> 03:00:39.28
That could be debated forever

2891
03:00:39.28 --> 03:00:40.92
and it kind of depends on what your standard is.

2892
03:00:40.92 --> 03:00:42.48
You know, like, whoa, what does it look like

2893
03:00:42.48 --> 03:00:44.76
to be over the edge on that?

2894
03:00:44.76 --> 03:00:45.72
Like, I'm not sure.

2895
03:00:45.72 --> 03:00:47.32
I just know it's worse.

2896
03:00:47.32 --> 03:00:48.92
I just know it's gotten a lot worse.

2897
03:00:48.92 --> 03:00:53.24
And other reference Jonathan Height quite a bit

2898
03:00:53.24 --> 03:00:56.32
in this book, one of my favorite authors.

2899
03:00:56.32 --> 03:00:58.32
And his book, The Coddling of the American Mind,

2900
03:00:58.32 --> 03:00:59.16
is a great read.

2901
03:00:59.16 --> 03:01:01.72
If you're really looking to examine how this evolved

2902
03:01:01.72 --> 03:01:04.24
on college campuses and they can really examine it

2903
03:01:04.24 --> 03:01:07.96
down to the year, about 2013, which

2904
03:01:07.96 --> 03:01:10.40
and then they examine all the reasons for this,

2905
03:01:10.40 --> 03:01:11.48
the sort of outreach culture.

2906
03:01:11.48 --> 03:01:13.72
And even then, though, they point out,

2907
03:01:13.72 --> 03:01:17.48
it's mostly at the coastal elite institutions.

2908
03:01:17.48 --> 03:01:19.76
It happens a lot less on other college campuses

2909
03:01:19.76 --> 03:01:21.96
where less in the reality is most college kids

2910
03:01:21.96 --> 03:01:25.72
just want to get drunk and get through their next class.

2911
03:01:25.72 --> 03:01:31.72
And they're not super hyped up about politics.

2912
03:01:31.72 --> 03:01:34.20
Social media, the fact, and those of us who live

2913
03:01:34.20 --> 03:01:35.48
within the world of social media

2914
03:01:35.48 --> 03:01:39.88
also makes us believe that it's a lot worse than it really is.

2915
03:01:39.88 --> 03:01:41.64
And you have to remove yourself from that.

2916
03:01:41.64 --> 03:01:44.60
And so you won't seem to be using examples

2917
03:01:44.60 --> 03:01:48.56
in this book of people on social media.

2918
03:01:48.56 --> 03:01:52.20
You'll seem to be using examples from leaders in our country.

2919
03:01:52.20 --> 03:01:58.40
And big media companies like The New York Times,

2920
03:01:58.40 --> 03:02:01.08
really pushing these narratives.

2921
03:02:01.08 --> 03:02:04.88
So I'm not getting my evidence for this problem

2922
03:02:04.88 --> 03:02:08.52
from random commentators, even if I could count thousands

2923
03:02:08.52 --> 03:02:10.40
of them, because it's like what are thousands?

2924
03:02:10.40 --> 03:02:11.68
A tiny, tiny little, little, little, little

2925
03:02:11.68 --> 03:02:13.24
beauty fraction of the United States.

2926
03:02:13.24 --> 03:02:16.44
What matters is the leaders and how that's changed over time.

2927
03:02:16.44 --> 03:02:18.44
So that's why I come at this and I say,

2928
03:02:18.44 --> 03:02:21.12
there is a real problem here and we're there

2929
03:02:21.12 --> 03:02:23.36
because our leaders are talking like this.

2930
03:02:23.36 --> 03:02:26.88
Like this is a bigger movement than just some idiots

2931
03:02:26.88 --> 03:02:27.64
on Twitter.

2932
03:02:27.64 --> 03:02:28.72
It's bigger than that.

2933
03:02:28.72 --> 03:02:31.04
And so that's why I'm not going to be

2934
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:34.32
I think it's such a, because if I couldn't find those

2935
03:02:34.32 --> 03:02:37.40
examples, then I would argue that,

2936
03:02:37.40 --> 03:02:38.76
yeah, maybe I'm over blowing it.

2937
03:02:38.76 --> 03:02:43.76
But the victimhood ideologies is it's here.

2938
03:02:45.32 --> 03:02:48.60
And I could, from what you just read,

2939
03:02:48.60 --> 03:02:50.08
the argument I'm making there,

2940
03:02:50.08 --> 03:02:52.72
unless you were going to go on to something else.

2941
03:02:52.72 --> 03:02:53.56
Go ahead.

2942
03:02:53.56 --> 03:02:55.60
See the argument I'm making there is that there's a series

2943
03:02:55.60 --> 03:02:57.76
of steps that have led to this moment

2944
03:02:57.76 --> 03:03:00.32
where we're trying a different story about America.

2945
03:03:00.32 --> 03:03:04.56
And I give an analysis of how it's victimhood ideology

2946
03:03:04.56 --> 03:03:05.40
that's created this.

2947
03:03:05.40 --> 03:03:07.60
There's a lot of elements, but victimhood ideologies

2948
03:03:07.60 --> 03:03:08.84
are big one.

2949
03:03:08.84 --> 03:03:10.32
It's because it first starts small.

2950
03:03:10.32 --> 03:03:12.44
As I know there, it's a small beginnings

2951
03:03:12.44 --> 03:03:14.64
where you're blaming somebody else,

2952
03:03:14.64 --> 03:03:16.64
like maybe it's your platoon commander,

2953
03:03:16.64 --> 03:03:18.60
who just didn't see the value in you,

2954
03:03:18.60 --> 03:03:20.000
the way they should have.

2955
03:03:21.12 --> 03:03:23.76
Which by the way, if you talk to modern military commanders

2956
03:03:23.76 --> 03:03:26.76
as they problem with a younger generation,

2957
03:03:26.76 --> 03:03:30.40
like they're seeing these differences in how it is to manage troops.

2958
03:03:30.40 --> 03:03:32.24
It's just different.

2959
03:03:32.24 --> 03:03:34.48
It's not the same.

2960
03:03:34.48 --> 03:03:36.32
Like I came into the seal teams thinking,

2961
03:03:36.32 --> 03:03:40.32
okay, I have to, I feel like I have to earn my way here.

2962
03:03:40.32 --> 03:03:44.04
Newer, maybe team guys may be not team guys,

2963
03:03:44.04 --> 03:03:46.000
but definitely in the military.

2964
03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.80
Newer troops are thinking like they're owed more

2965
03:03:49.80 --> 03:03:50.84
than, or they're,

2966
03:03:50.84 --> 03:03:52.92
the organization itself has a duty to them,

2967
03:03:52.92 --> 03:03:54.56
but not the other way around.

2968
03:03:54.56 --> 03:03:56.96
Like a duty to give them more responsibility

2969
03:03:56.96 --> 03:03:59.80
and leadership or whatever,

2970
03:03:59.80 --> 03:04:02.52
but they haven't quite earned it yet.

2971
03:04:02.52 --> 03:04:05.12
More status, but without earning it yet.

2972
03:04:05.12 --> 03:04:07.40
This is something when I talk to leaders,

2973
03:04:07.40 --> 03:04:10.24
I'm curious what your perception is on this

2974
03:04:10.24 --> 03:04:12.48
because you talk to so many corporate leaders

2975
03:04:12.48 --> 03:04:16.56
and how it is to manage the different generations.

2976
03:04:16.56 --> 03:04:18.16
I don't know what that's like.

2977
03:04:18.16 --> 03:04:19.64
Not only corporations,

2978
03:04:19.64 --> 03:04:23.24
but also still talking to military troops

2979
03:04:23.24 --> 03:04:26.52
and there's always people,

2980
03:04:26.52 --> 03:04:30.12
well, this is a question that I get asked all the time.

2981
03:04:30.12 --> 03:04:34.56
And it's, you know, what's wrong with my team?

2982
03:04:35.96 --> 03:04:38.24
And you can probably guess how I answer that.

2983
03:04:38.24 --> 03:04:39.84
This is leadership problem.

2984
03:04:39.84 --> 03:04:42.64
And one of the things I fall back to all the time,

2985
03:04:42.64 --> 03:04:47.64
so I don't know that I can think of a more difficult

2986
03:04:47.64 --> 03:04:51.16
workforce to deal with than being,

2987
03:04:51.16 --> 03:04:54.20
than dealing with draftees in Vietnam,

2988
03:04:54.20 --> 03:04:55.44
in Vietnam more.

2989
03:04:55.44 --> 03:04:57.68
People that did not believe in the cause

2990
03:04:57.68 --> 03:05:01.04
did not want to do the job and in doing the job,

2991
03:05:01.04 --> 03:05:04.36
their life and limb was at risk.

2992
03:05:04.36 --> 03:05:06.96
You cannot think of a more difficult workforce

2993
03:05:06.96 --> 03:05:08.04
to try and deal with.

2994
03:05:08.04 --> 03:05:13.04
So I've read many, many, many, many books

2995
03:05:13.04 --> 03:05:13.96
about Vietnam.

2996
03:05:13.96 --> 03:05:18.96
I've interviewed many Vietnam veterans, leaders,

2997
03:05:18.96 --> 03:05:21.36
and troops.

2998
03:05:21.36 --> 03:05:23.16
And here's the deal.

2999
03:05:23.16 --> 03:05:26.08
Good leaders, good leaders.

3000
03:05:26.08 --> 03:05:29.56
And my first example is Colonel David Hackworth,

3001
03:05:29.56 --> 03:05:32.24
who's like my personal mentor,

3002
03:05:32.24 --> 03:05:36.40
he might never met him, but I read his book many times

3003
03:05:36.40 --> 03:05:37.56
and all of his books many times.

3004
03:05:37.56 --> 03:05:40.16
But when he talks about the draftees

3005
03:05:40.16 --> 03:05:43.48
and he was in Korea and he was in Vietnam,

3006
03:05:43.48 --> 03:05:45.16
he's a battalion commander, Vietnam.

3007
03:05:45.16 --> 03:05:47.000
He was one of the most decorated guys ever.

3008
03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.72
And when he would talk and he was a complete lifer,

3009
03:05:49.72 --> 03:05:51.24
this guy worshiped the army.

3010
03:05:51.24 --> 03:05:54.12
He was in the military since just 15 years old.

3011
03:05:54.12 --> 03:05:56.72
He was all he ever knew.

3012
03:05:56.72 --> 03:05:59.12
And when he would talk about his draftees

3013
03:05:59.12 --> 03:06:01.24
and when he talks about him in his book about face,

3014
03:06:01.24 --> 03:06:03.16
he loved his draftees.

3015
03:06:03.16 --> 03:06:06.36
And he loved his draftees because guess what?

3016
03:06:06.36 --> 03:06:09.72
They would call bullshit when they didn't think he was

3017
03:06:09.72 --> 03:06:10.92
making a good call.

3018
03:06:10.92 --> 03:06:13.60
They would give him pressure against what he was saying to do

3019
03:06:13.60 --> 03:06:14.92
if it didn't make sense.

3020
03:06:14.92 --> 03:06:16.24
They would test him.

3021
03:06:16.24 --> 03:06:17.64
They would push back.

3022
03:06:17.64 --> 03:06:21.20
And as a leader, he thought that's exactly what I want.

3023
03:06:21.20 --> 03:06:23.36
That's exactly what I want is,

3024
03:06:23.36 --> 03:06:25.64
I don't want people, I don't want to bunch of robots.

3025
03:06:25.64 --> 03:06:30.64
I had one of his company commanders on the podcast

3026
03:06:30.64 --> 03:06:31.84
who retired as a general.

3027
03:06:32.88 --> 03:06:35.76
Mook, Mookayama, general Mookayama,

3028
03:06:35.76 --> 03:06:37.40
fantastic guy.

3029
03:06:37.40 --> 03:06:40.96
And I asked him and he was a company commander, Vietnam.

3030
03:06:40.96 --> 03:06:42.48
And I said, what?

3031
03:06:42.48 --> 03:06:44.56
Because this question I hear all the time,

3032
03:06:44.56 --> 03:06:49.000
I said, you know, sir, what did you think of your draftees,

3033
03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:50.40
in Vietnam?

3034
03:06:50.40 --> 03:06:54.12
And he said, I really couldn't tell who was a draftee

3035
03:06:54.12 --> 03:06:55.04
and who wasn't.

3036
03:06:56.24 --> 03:07:00.20
And so then you read author books and what it boils down to is,

3037
03:07:00.20 --> 03:07:02.44
and most of the books that are read are like interviews

3038
03:07:02.44 --> 03:07:03.28
with people.

3039
03:07:03.28 --> 03:07:07.20
And if you have leaders that are not good leaders,

3040
03:07:07.20 --> 03:07:10.84
guess what they do, they complain about the draftees,

3041
03:07:10.84 --> 03:07:13.52
about how they push back, they didn't follow orders.

3042
03:07:13.52 --> 03:07:16.28
People like William Callie in charge of the MII masquer.

3043
03:07:16.28 --> 03:07:17.12
What did he say?

3044
03:07:17.12 --> 03:07:18.64
He hated draftees.

3045
03:07:20.24 --> 03:07:21.72
Because he's a shitty leader.

3046
03:07:22.80 --> 03:07:25.80
And so when you talked to me about a millennial,

3047
03:07:25.80 --> 03:07:28.80
the characteristics of a millennial,

3048
03:07:28.80 --> 03:07:31.60
hey, they think they deserve stuff,

3049
03:07:31.60 --> 03:07:33.56
they want to know why they're doing what they're doing,

3050
03:07:33.56 --> 03:07:35.04
they want to have ownership of stuff,

3051
03:07:35.04 --> 03:07:37.04
they think they deserve to be in charge of stuff.

3052
03:07:37.04 --> 03:07:39.68
And I'm like, bring me that new guy.

3053
03:07:39.68 --> 03:07:41.72
I'll take that new guy any day of the week.

3054
03:07:41.72 --> 03:07:42.96
And I'll take that new guy and be like,

3055
03:07:42.96 --> 03:07:45.56
okay, you want to run stuff, you want to know why you're doing

3056
03:07:45.56 --> 03:07:46.40
what you're doing?

3057
03:07:46.40 --> 03:07:47.64
Absolutely, you deserve that.

3058
03:07:47.64 --> 03:07:48.56
That's decentralized command,

3059
03:07:48.56 --> 03:07:49.84
you need to know why you're doing what you're doing.

3060
03:07:49.84 --> 03:07:50.84
Perfect.

3061
03:07:50.84 --> 03:07:52.04
You want to take ownership of stuff?

3062
03:07:52.04 --> 03:07:53.20
Absolutely.

3063
03:07:53.20 --> 03:07:56.24
You think you should be in a higher elevated position.

3064
03:07:56.24 --> 03:07:58.64
Good, let's get you there.

3065
03:07:58.64 --> 03:08:03.64
So we can always complain about the junior generation.

3066
03:08:04.96 --> 03:08:08.000
The freaking kids and the teams right now are way better

3067
03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
than I was when I checked in as a new guy,

3068
03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:11.32
are you kidding me?

3069
03:08:11.32 --> 03:08:12.52
They're way better.

3070
03:08:12.52 --> 03:08:14.68
They're tough bastards too.

3071
03:08:14.68 --> 03:08:16.04
It's not like they're just more tech,

3072
03:08:16.04 --> 03:08:17.28
you know, some people will say,

3073
03:08:17.28 --> 03:08:19.48
well, you know, the new generation's more tech savvy.

3074
03:08:19.48 --> 03:08:20.72
It's like, yeah, they are.

3075
03:08:20.72 --> 03:08:22.04
And their tough is hell.

3076
03:08:23.16 --> 03:08:28.000
So when we start talking about what the problem with is

3077
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.32
with our troops, what a good leader does is says,

3078
03:08:31.32 --> 03:08:35.72
okay, there's these, I need to treat this guy with,

3079
03:08:35.72 --> 03:08:37.36
I need to make some maneuvers here

3080
03:08:37.36 --> 03:08:39.20
to get this person on board with the program

3081
03:08:39.20 --> 03:08:41.88
because it's not like some young army guys,

3082
03:08:41.88 --> 03:08:43.76
like I don't want to do a good job.

3083
03:08:43.76 --> 03:08:45.84
It's not like some person at a tech company,

3084
03:08:45.84 --> 03:08:47.92
some person that just graduated from college

3085
03:08:47.92 --> 03:08:49.92
and went to a tech company's like, you know what,

3086
03:08:49.92 --> 03:08:52.04
I don't want to do well here.

3087
03:08:52.04 --> 03:08:53.68
Like no, they want to do well.

3088
03:08:53.68 --> 03:08:56.92
Now they might have some high visions of themselves.

3089
03:08:56.92 --> 03:08:59.52
Cool, who's job is to put those visions in the check?

3090
03:08:59.52 --> 03:09:01.72
Who's job is to explain them, listen man,

3091
03:09:01.72 --> 03:09:04.20
I'm glad you want to step up and run everything.

3092
03:09:04.20 --> 03:09:05.64
That's awesome.

3093
03:09:05.64 --> 03:09:07.24
Let me ask you this.

3094
03:09:07.24 --> 03:09:08.68
Do you even understand how this,

3095
03:09:08.68 --> 03:09:11.20
you know, how the economy of our businesses working right now?

3096
03:09:11.20 --> 03:09:14.04
To explain this, here, look at this spreadsheet

3097
03:09:14.04 --> 03:09:15.24
and explain what this means.

3098
03:09:15.24 --> 03:09:18.20
I have no idea, okay, cool, let's get you educated on this.

3099
03:09:18.20 --> 03:09:19.76
Let's get you to learn this because you know what?

3100
03:09:19.76 --> 03:09:21.08
I do want you to elevate.

3101
03:09:21.08 --> 03:09:22.56
I want you to take over this company.

3102
03:09:22.56 --> 03:09:23.76
That's fine.

3103
03:09:23.76 --> 03:09:25.20
But you've got to learn this stuff with you.

3104
03:09:25.20 --> 03:09:28.68
So as a leader, we've got to look at people

3105
03:09:28.68 --> 03:09:30.36
and this again, this happens all the time

3106
03:09:30.36 --> 03:09:32.000
and it happens within one puttune.

3107
03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.20
You know, I guarantee you had guys in your puttune

3108
03:09:35.20 --> 03:09:36.68
that thought they knew everything

3109
03:09:36.68 --> 03:09:38.76
and you had some guys that were like happy to be here

3110
03:09:38.76 --> 03:09:39.68
and they're just humble.

3111
03:09:39.68 --> 03:09:41.08
You get all these guys.

3112
03:09:41.08 --> 03:09:43.56
You get all these guys and is there some

3113
03:09:43.56 --> 03:09:45.84
little difference in the generations?

3114
03:09:45.84 --> 03:09:47.72
Sure, there's always difference in the generations.

3115
03:09:47.72 --> 03:09:50.84
No freaking generation was just always mine, right?

3116
03:09:50.84 --> 03:09:53.000
We always hear that, you know, the guys

3117
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.08
when I got to the teams, it was like the guys

3118
03:09:55.08 --> 03:09:57.88
from the 70s were like, oh, the guys from the 80s are weak.

3119
03:09:57.88 --> 03:09:59.36
And then the guys from the 80s said the guys

3120
03:09:59.36 --> 03:10:00.28
from the 90s were weak.

3121
03:10:00.28 --> 03:10:02.20
Like let's just keep going.

3122
03:10:02.20 --> 03:10:04.24
How do we reflect things as a leader?

3123
03:10:04.24 --> 03:10:05.48
Make adjustments.

3124
03:10:05.48 --> 03:10:07.48
When if my team is not performing well,

3125
03:10:07.48 --> 03:10:09.32
I'm a hundred percent responsible for it.

3126
03:10:09.32 --> 03:10:10.76
If my team has a bad attitude,

3127
03:10:10.76 --> 03:10:13.04
I'm a hundred percent responsible for it.

3128
03:10:13.04 --> 03:10:14.32
And I'm going to get it fixed.

3129
03:10:14.32 --> 03:10:14.96
That's what I'm going to do.

3130
03:10:14.96 --> 03:10:17.08
I'm responsible for doing that.

3131
03:10:17.08 --> 03:10:22.16
Yeah, that's a very nuanced look at this.

3132
03:10:22.16 --> 03:10:23.92
I'm always asking this question because I'm

3133
03:10:23.92 --> 03:10:25.44
a animal millennial, you know?

3134
03:10:25.44 --> 03:10:31.000
It's hard to generalize a generation.

3135
03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:34.04
You just can't, but you have to.

3136
03:10:34.04 --> 03:10:35.96
There are stereotypes exist for a reason.

3137
03:10:35.96 --> 03:10:38.96
So it's good for analysis to try and figure that out.

3138
03:10:38.96 --> 03:10:41.32
And I don't know.

3139
03:10:41.32 --> 03:10:42.64
I don't know where I fall on it.

3140
03:10:42.64 --> 03:10:46.24
Because I see the, I do see some bad aspects.

3141
03:10:46.24 --> 03:10:50.68
And you know, wanting more responsibility was maybe the wrong thing

3142
03:10:50.68 --> 03:10:53.76
to hit on as a negative attribute.

3143
03:10:53.76 --> 03:10:56.88
That's obviously a good thing.

3144
03:10:56.88 --> 03:11:01.64
But sometimes it's accompanied by a,

3145
03:11:01.64 --> 03:11:06.76
a not so humble belief that somebody is victimizing them

3146
03:11:06.76 --> 03:11:10.72
and preventing them from moving up because of some kind of oppression.

3147
03:11:10.72 --> 03:11:11.76
And that's.

3148
03:11:11.76 --> 03:11:14.76
And if I get someone like that on my team,

3149
03:11:14.76 --> 03:11:16.76
who's responsible for fixing that attitude?

3150
03:11:16.76 --> 03:11:18.64
I can promise you right now.

3151
03:11:18.64 --> 03:11:20.24
We'll play the question game all day long.

3152
03:11:20.24 --> 03:11:22.36
And I do this with every level leadership.

3153
03:11:22.36 --> 03:11:24.44
I have people coming, you know, my team's all jacked up.

3154
03:11:24.44 --> 03:11:25.36
OK, cool.

3155
03:11:25.36 --> 03:11:26.76
Who's in charge of your team?

3156
03:11:26.76 --> 03:11:28.84
Well, yeah, that's right.

3157
03:11:28.84 --> 03:11:29.20
You are.

3158
03:11:29.20 --> 03:11:31.04
Or someone will say, my front line troops aren't doing what I'm doing.

3159
03:11:31.04 --> 03:11:33.12
Oh, who's in charge of your front front line troops?

3160
03:11:33.12 --> 03:11:33.72
It's Bill.

3161
03:11:33.72 --> 03:11:34.72
OK, who's in charge of Bill?

3162
03:11:34.72 --> 03:11:36.32
Mike, who's in charge of Mike?

3163
03:11:36.32 --> 03:11:36.96
Me.

3164
03:11:36.96 --> 03:11:38.28
That's right.

3165
03:11:38.28 --> 03:11:40.32
You're responsible for what's going on down there.

3166
03:11:40.32 --> 03:11:43.20
And if there's attitudes that you don't like,

3167
03:11:43.20 --> 03:11:45.60
man, you're responsible for it.

3168
03:11:45.60 --> 03:11:47.56
You are absolutely responsible for it.

3169
03:11:47.56 --> 03:11:49.96
And if you're a good leader, you can get those attitudes

3170
03:11:49.96 --> 03:11:51.92
to shift in the right direction.

3171
03:11:51.92 --> 03:11:55.16
And generally, by doing exactly what we're talking about.

3172
03:11:55.16 --> 03:11:57.56
When, and you and I were having a conversation earlier,

3173
03:11:57.56 --> 03:12:00.32
it's like, if they understand why these decisions

3174
03:12:00.32 --> 03:12:04.04
are being made or why they actually need to learn

3175
03:12:04.04 --> 03:12:06.88
some of these front line jobs before they can move up the chain

3176
03:12:06.88 --> 03:12:09.20
of rent, if they understand that they have a path

3177
03:12:09.20 --> 03:12:12.92
for mobility to increase their pay and increase their

3178
03:12:12.92 --> 03:12:14.88
responsibility inside of an organization,

3179
03:12:14.88 --> 03:12:17.12
they'll go, OK, well, thank you for telling me that.

3180
03:12:17.12 --> 03:12:19.000
And now I'm going to go get after it.

3181
03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:22.40
As opposed to Millennial suck.

3182
03:12:22.40 --> 03:12:25.84
And I can't deal with Millennial.

3183
03:12:25.84 --> 03:12:27.24
It's like, OK, cool.

3184
03:12:27.24 --> 03:12:28.24
Yeah.

3185
03:12:28.24 --> 03:12:31.84
I mean, I guess that's why I wrote the book, right?

3186
03:12:31.84 --> 03:12:34.20
Because because I do see these things as problems.

3187
03:12:34.20 --> 03:12:37.28
And I don't see them in my team.

3188
03:12:37.28 --> 03:12:38.44
My team's great.

3189
03:12:38.44 --> 03:12:40.84
And they're Millennials or younger.

3190
03:12:40.84 --> 03:12:45.48
So obviously, something is working there.

3191
03:12:45.48 --> 03:12:48.36
Maybe that's because I hired the right people with the right

3192
03:12:48.36 --> 03:12:49.48
temperament.

3193
03:12:49.48 --> 03:12:50.000
I don't know.

3194
03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.88
And who's in charge of doing that?

3195
03:12:51.88 --> 03:12:52.48
Well, Nate.

3196
03:12:52.48 --> 03:12:53.48
Exactly.

3197
03:12:53.48 --> 03:12:54.16
Exactly.

3198
03:12:54.16 --> 03:12:56.88
So when you meet someone that says, oh, I got these horrible people

3199
03:12:56.88 --> 03:12:58.52
on my team.

3200
03:12:58.52 --> 03:12:59.36
Have you tried to fix them?

3201
03:12:59.36 --> 03:13:00.16
Yeah, but I can't fix them.

3202
03:13:00.16 --> 03:13:01.28
Well, hey, who's fault is that?

3203
03:13:01.28 --> 03:13:04.000
Who actually hired these people in the first place?

3204
03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:07.44
If you sit down with someone and you interview them or you hire them

3205
03:13:07.44 --> 03:13:10.24
and then they're horrible and they have a horrible attitude and they don't want

3206
03:13:10.24 --> 03:13:11.60
to be a part of the team, great.

3207
03:13:11.60 --> 03:13:12.80
You're not going to be a part of my team.

3208
03:13:12.80 --> 03:13:13.80
Yeah.

3209
03:13:13.80 --> 03:13:17.24
You're not going to be a part of my team if that's what you bring to the table.

3210
03:13:17.24 --> 03:13:21.04
And so this book, I think, is like what I'm trying to do is look at it

3211
03:13:21.04 --> 03:13:22.64
in a broader cultural problem.

3212
03:13:22.64 --> 03:13:23.52
Because it is.

3213
03:13:23.52 --> 03:13:24.52
It is.

3214
03:13:24.52 --> 03:13:28.04
And then try to give lessons to fix it.

3215
03:13:28.04 --> 03:13:33.04
Because for all the reasons you just stated, it's like it's, we have to take

3216
03:13:33.04 --> 03:13:35.40
ownership of our culture as well.

3217
03:13:35.40 --> 03:13:38.68
It's not just ownership of our team that we can, you know, you should,

3218
03:13:38.68 --> 03:13:42.48
of course, and that you can control a lot when you're leading a team.

3219
03:13:42.48 --> 03:13:46.32
But we've got to come together as a culture and be better.

3220
03:13:46.32 --> 03:13:51.24
Because as a part you read, as an individual, you're an individual

3221
03:13:51.24 --> 03:13:53.64
threat in the larger fabric of society.

3222
03:13:53.64 --> 03:13:58.52
And our culture is being transformed and not in a good way.

3223
03:13:58.52 --> 03:14:02.04
And I hope the problem isn't as bad as I kind of make it out to be.

3224
03:14:02.04 --> 03:14:06.92
But, you know, worst case scenario, I'm wrong.

3225
03:14:06.92 --> 03:14:09.000
And things are going on in a great direction.

3226
03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:12.60
Well, even I wouldn't say worst case scenario you're wrong.

3227
03:14:12.60 --> 03:14:15.76
I mean, clearly there are indicators of what you're talking about.

3228
03:14:15.76 --> 03:14:18.64
And as you said, you're not talking about people on Twitter.

3229
03:14:18.64 --> 03:14:23.60
You're talking about mainstream media organizations that

3230
03:14:23.60 --> 03:14:25.84
proceed in this direction.

3231
03:14:25.84 --> 03:14:29.60
And the analysis, because I went on off on a tangent talking about

3232
03:14:29.60 --> 03:14:32.84
millennials and management issues with them.

3233
03:14:32.84 --> 03:14:37.60
So the analysis I go into is it goes something like this.

3234
03:14:37.60 --> 03:14:39.20
You believe in a victimhood ideology.

3235
03:14:39.20 --> 03:14:41.60
Believe that somebody else is to blame, maybe it's your team,

3236
03:14:41.60 --> 03:14:44.32
maybe it's your boss, maybe it's your parent, maybe it's your teacher.

3237
03:14:44.32 --> 03:14:46.20
Whatever it is, somebody else is fault.

3238
03:14:46.20 --> 03:14:46.60
Okay.

3239
03:14:46.60 --> 03:14:50.20
You're in that, you're living that story about yourself individually.

3240
03:14:50.20 --> 03:14:51.92
That is expanded.

3241
03:14:51.92 --> 03:14:53.40
It's expanded to groups.

3242
03:14:53.40 --> 03:14:56.40
It's expanded to this sort of group on group identity politics.

3243
03:14:56.40 --> 03:15:00.84
And that my fate is tied to an immutable characteristic that is tied to a group.

3244
03:15:00.84 --> 03:15:04.40
Maybe it's race, maybe it's gender, maybe it's socioeconomic in nature.

3245
03:15:04.40 --> 03:15:09.40
And by consequence, there is another group of pressing my group.

3246
03:15:09.40 --> 03:15:10.40
Okay.

3247
03:15:10.40 --> 03:15:11.40
So it's group on group politics.

3248
03:15:11.40 --> 03:15:13.40
This is identity politics to the courts.

3249
03:15:13.40 --> 03:15:16.40
It's the promise of more power from one group to another.

3250
03:15:16.40 --> 03:15:17.40
Okay.

3251
03:15:17.40 --> 03:15:22.40
You're telling somebody there, a victim, and you're telling them that you're the champion of them against the oppressors.

3252
03:15:22.40 --> 03:15:24.40
So that's the next thing.

3253
03:15:24.40 --> 03:15:26.40
Then it evolves even more than that.

3254
03:15:26.40 --> 03:15:29.40
It evolves into these kind of institutional conflicts.

3255
03:15:29.40 --> 03:15:32.40
And so it's not just a group that's oppressing you.

3256
03:15:32.40 --> 03:15:35.40
That group is tied to a broader institution.

3257
03:15:35.40 --> 03:15:37.40
Maybe that institution is the church.

3258
03:15:37.40 --> 03:15:41.40
Maybe that institution is some kind of cultural institution.

3259
03:15:41.40 --> 03:15:44.40
Maybe it's a merit, maybe it's a meritocracy.

3260
03:15:44.40 --> 03:15:46.40
That's me that's an institution.

3261
03:15:46.40 --> 03:15:51.40
This notion that we compete based off of merit and that your reward is tied.

3262
03:15:51.40 --> 03:15:54.40
To how well you perform or your talent.

3263
03:15:54.40 --> 03:15:59.40
The meritocracy is an important institutional construct in our culture.

3264
03:15:59.40 --> 03:16:00.40
Okay.

3265
03:16:00.40 --> 03:16:01.40
There's other institutions too.

3266
03:16:01.40 --> 03:16:02.40
Like the Supreme Court.

3267
03:16:02.40 --> 03:16:03.40
Okay.

3268
03:16:03.40 --> 03:16:05.40
When you're talking about packing the Supreme Court,

3269
03:16:05.40 --> 03:16:08.40
you're talking about tearing down an institution.

3270
03:16:08.40 --> 03:16:09.40
So there's government institutions.

3271
03:16:09.40 --> 03:16:11.40
There's cultural institutions.

3272
03:16:11.40 --> 03:16:12.40
There's social institutions.

3273
03:16:12.40 --> 03:16:16.40
The word institution is malleable in that sense.

3274
03:16:16.40 --> 03:16:20.40
And it should describe a kind of a cultural friend.

3275
03:16:20.40 --> 03:16:23.40
Kind of a cultural framework that we operate in, I think.

3276
03:16:23.40 --> 03:16:25.40
Those come under attack.

3277
03:16:25.40 --> 03:16:28.40
You know, because it's the institution's fault.

3278
03:16:28.40 --> 03:16:35.40
I talk about Thomas Sol, he's an economist and Hoover Institute and Stanford.

3279
03:16:35.40 --> 03:16:39.40
Amazing, amazing thinker and author.

3280
03:16:39.40 --> 03:16:47.40
He talks about how the French Revolution was laid by Russo.

3281
03:16:47.40 --> 03:16:54.40
It was based on this idea that the natural state of things involved no suffering.

3282
03:16:54.40 --> 03:16:58.40
But that it is institutions that cause suffering.

3283
03:16:58.40 --> 03:17:00.40
That's a really interesting concept.

3284
03:17:00.40 --> 03:17:03.40
It's like this belief that life is actually,

3285
03:17:03.40 --> 03:17:10.40
it is not natural in life to be oppressed or to go through suffering.

3286
03:17:10.40 --> 03:17:11.40
It is not natural.

3287
03:17:11.40 --> 03:17:12.40
It is natural.

3288
03:17:12.40 --> 03:17:14.40
It is the unnatural institutions.

3289
03:17:14.40 --> 03:17:17.40
Man made institutions that created your suffering.

3290
03:17:17.40 --> 03:17:20.40
Therefore, we must revolutionize those institutions.

3291
03:17:20.40 --> 03:17:22.40
Terror them down and build our utopia.

3292
03:17:22.40 --> 03:17:24.40
This was how the French Revolution happened.

3293
03:17:24.40 --> 03:17:29.40
This is how 17,000 people were dead in the next few years from the terror that ensued.

3294
03:17:29.40 --> 03:17:34.40
It is the thinking that led to Marxism and the horrors of the 20th century.

3295
03:17:34.40 --> 03:17:40.40
This isn't all that controversial statement to make.

3296
03:17:40.40 --> 03:17:42.40
It's just kind of how it happened.

3297
03:17:42.40 --> 03:17:48.40
That is how the progressive left thinks as well.

3298
03:17:48.40 --> 03:17:50.40
It comes from somewhere.

3299
03:17:50.40 --> 03:17:54.40
Progressiveism has a history, just like conservatism has a history.

3300
03:17:54.40 --> 03:17:58.40
It is a history based on this kind of your feelings are correct.

3301
03:17:58.40 --> 03:18:01.40
If you feel something it must be right.

3302
03:18:01.40 --> 03:18:03.40
And you should.

3303
03:18:03.40 --> 03:18:07.40
And the injustices against you are always man-made.

3304
03:18:07.40 --> 03:18:09.40
And they're always coming from an oppressor.

3305
03:18:09.40 --> 03:18:11.40
They're never a natural part of life.

3306
03:18:11.40 --> 03:18:15.40
Therefore, government is there to fix those institutions.

3307
03:18:15.40 --> 03:18:18.40
That's why you must proceed with the revolution.

3308
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:21.40
This is the thinking that occurs.

3309
03:18:21.40 --> 03:18:25.40
So that ends up, once you've turned down the institutions,

3310
03:18:25.40 --> 03:18:28.40
there's another ultimate oppressor and it's the American founding itself.

3311
03:18:28.40 --> 03:18:31.40
That's the story of America that keeps getting told.

3312
03:18:31.40 --> 03:18:33.40
And that worries me a great deal.

3313
03:18:33.40 --> 03:18:34.40
We didn't use to fight about that.

3314
03:18:34.40 --> 03:18:37.40
The left and the right did not fight about the story of America.

3315
03:18:37.40 --> 03:18:38.40
The way we're fighting about it now.

3316
03:18:38.40 --> 03:18:45.40
And it's become this question of whether America was even founded on anything good at all.

3317
03:18:45.40 --> 03:18:49.40
That's the story being spun.

3318
03:18:49.40 --> 03:18:52.40
And it stems from this individual victimhood identity politics.

3319
03:18:52.40 --> 03:18:54.40
And again, I'm not making this up.

3320
03:18:54.40 --> 03:18:59.40
I'm not because I'm looking at major leaders that say these kind of things.

3321
03:18:59.40 --> 03:19:01.40
You know, I quote, Beto.

3322
03:19:01.40 --> 03:19:03.40
I quote, Ilhan Omar.

3323
03:19:03.40 --> 03:19:07.40
America was founded on genocide, not that America committed genocide.

3324
03:19:07.40 --> 03:19:09.40
That would be an accurate statement.

3325
03:19:09.40 --> 03:19:11.40
But America was founded on it.

3326
03:19:11.40 --> 03:19:14.40
That implies a very different meaning.

3327
03:19:14.40 --> 03:19:18.40
Saying that white supremacy is a problem is a true statement.

3328
03:19:18.40 --> 03:19:20.40
Saying we were founded on it.

3329
03:19:20.40 --> 03:19:22.40
That's a different implication.

3330
03:19:22.40 --> 03:19:26.40
You're in dating the American founding itself.

3331
03:19:26.40 --> 03:19:27.40
So what does that lead to?

3332
03:19:27.40 --> 03:19:30.40
Well, it leads to popularity with burning the American flag.

3333
03:19:30.40 --> 03:19:33.40
Please, the popularity with kneeling for the national anthem.

3334
03:19:33.40 --> 03:19:39.40
It leads to popularity with with with with attacking the pledge of allegiance as an institution and an of itself.

3335
03:19:39.40 --> 03:19:48.40
It leads to it leads to the New York Times public, you know, the New York Times prioritizing a message that America is just okay.

3336
03:19:48.40 --> 03:19:58.40
On the Fourth of July, like it leads, you know, I open up in this chapter talking about the New York Times going after the Apollo 1158th anniversary.

3337
03:19:58.40 --> 03:20:03.40
Basically praising the USSR instead of America on this day.

3338
03:20:03.40 --> 03:20:06.40
It's like, why is that? Why is that the reaction?

3339
03:20:06.40 --> 03:20:12.40
Because there's there's need to tear down the institutions of America at its core.

3340
03:20:12.40 --> 03:20:14.40
Why is that?

3341
03:20:14.40 --> 03:20:21.40
Well, because you need to tear something down at its core if you want to implement the revolutionary utopia that you envision.

3342
03:20:21.40 --> 03:20:24.40
So this is the most political chapter by far, right?

3343
03:20:24.40 --> 03:20:29.40
This is where I really delve into the differences, like the real deep differences between conservatism and progressivism.

3344
03:20:29.40 --> 03:20:35.40
Because I announced conservators a little bit on this too, as far as the victim put ideology goes.

3345
03:20:35.40 --> 03:20:39.40
Like it's a different form of ideology, it's a different form of victim put, but it occurs.

3346
03:20:39.40 --> 03:20:44.40
And it occurs up to the limits of tearing down institutions.

3347
03:20:44.40 --> 03:20:48.40
Okay, conservators have a very inherent distrust of government institutions.

3348
03:20:48.40 --> 03:20:52.40
Like sometimes to a to a conspiratorial degree.

3349
03:20:52.40 --> 03:20:57.40
But we stop way short of actually bashing the founding of America.

3350
03:20:57.40 --> 03:21:02.40
And then the solutions to this problem, which is what I really end the chapter with,

3351
03:21:02.40 --> 03:21:09.40
I make a very strong argument for against, against progressivism as a solution to these problems.

3352
03:21:09.40 --> 03:21:15.40
Mostly because progressivism at its heart is a promise to end your suffering.

3353
03:21:15.40 --> 03:21:19.40
And that is an inherently dishonest promise to make.

3354
03:21:19.40 --> 03:21:22.40
For the reasons I just say again, that's the basis of the French Revolution.

3355
03:21:22.40 --> 03:21:25.40
We can end your suffering because it's man-made.

3356
03:21:25.40 --> 03:21:26.40
It's not natural.

3357
03:21:26.40 --> 03:21:30.40
The natural state of things is for you to live in a wonderful utopia,

3358
03:21:30.40 --> 03:21:33.40
prancing around in the trees or whatever the heck they're imagining.

3359
03:21:33.40 --> 03:21:35.40
It doesn't make any sense because it's not real.

3360
03:21:35.40 --> 03:21:40.40
And so to tell somebody that you will and they're suffering to tell them that you can replace God with government.

3361
03:21:40.40 --> 03:21:42.40
Because what is what is religion fundamentally?

3362
03:21:42.40 --> 03:21:48.40
It's like that Jesus took on the crucifixion and the passion of the Christ is about

3363
03:21:48.40 --> 03:21:51.40
him taking on the suffering.

3364
03:21:51.40 --> 03:21:54.40
There's a spiritual element to this.

3365
03:21:54.40 --> 03:22:02.40
And that can't be replaced by a government ideology.

3366
03:22:02.40 --> 03:22:08.40
Fundamentally, it's basically a progressiveism attempts to promise people.

3367
03:22:08.40 --> 03:22:12.40
And I'm also trying to define what I mean by the progressive movement,

3368
03:22:12.40 --> 03:22:15.40
very carefully in the book because I don't want.

3369
03:22:15.40 --> 03:22:20.40
There's a lot of people who identify as progressive because they just got back from a gay wedding.

3370
03:22:20.40 --> 03:22:21.40
Or they like to smoke some pot.

3371
03:22:21.40 --> 03:22:23.40
Or they like tattoos or whatever.

3372
03:22:23.40 --> 03:22:24.40
Or they do yoga.

3373
03:22:24.40 --> 03:22:31.40
Like, I define that very carefully as social progressivism in the modern sense.

3374
03:22:31.40 --> 03:22:33.40
And that's just not what we're talking about here.

3375
03:22:33.40 --> 03:22:38.40
I'm talking about the deeper underlying politics and history of the progressive movement

3376
03:22:38.40 --> 03:22:40.40
and what it's fundamentally promising people.

3377
03:22:40.40 --> 03:22:45.40
Talking about the role of government in your life.

3378
03:22:45.40 --> 03:22:48.40
And because, again, I want to be readable to a lot of different people.

3379
03:22:48.40 --> 03:22:51.40
But this is the most political chapter by far.

3380
03:22:51.40 --> 03:22:59.40
You know, one thing that speaking of the tattooed yoga, whatever person,

3381
03:22:59.40 --> 03:23:02.40
I was a really rebellious kid, right?

3382
03:23:02.40 --> 03:23:09.40
And I think at some point there's going to have to be like a, like a,

3383
03:23:09.40 --> 03:23:14.40
Republican with a Mohawk and face tattoos.

3384
03:23:14.40 --> 03:23:18.40
That's going to come out and say, like, hey,

3385
03:23:18.40 --> 03:23:21.40
I have face tattoos.

3386
03:23:21.40 --> 03:23:27.40
I like whatever genre of underground subculture music.

3387
03:23:27.40 --> 03:23:31.40
I don't want to conform to anything.

3388
03:23:31.40 --> 03:23:38.40
And the best way to live that life is to actually support conservative values

3389
03:23:38.40 --> 03:23:42.40
because conservative values support individual freedom.

3390
03:23:42.40 --> 03:23:43.40
And that's what I believe in.

3391
03:23:43.40 --> 03:23:46.40
And I think that's what's going to get some of these,

3392
03:23:46.40 --> 03:23:50.40
because let's face it, an 18-year-old kid wants to be rebellious.

3393
03:23:50.40 --> 03:23:51.40
Why?

3394
03:23:51.40 --> 03:23:53.40
Because they trying to get out of the house, they're trying to show their dad,

3395
03:23:53.40 --> 03:23:56.40
they don't need him anymore, they're trying to show their mom, they don't need him anymore.

3396
03:23:56.40 --> 03:23:59.40
So I'm going to get a Mohawk and I'm going to tattoo him, my neck,

3397
03:23:59.40 --> 03:24:01.40
and I'm going to move forward into the world.

3398
03:24:01.40 --> 03:24:04.40
And other kids look around and go, okay, that's how we're rebelling.

3399
03:24:04.40 --> 03:24:12.40
But at some point, you go, actually, it just blows my mind that people say,

3400
03:24:12.40 --> 03:24:15.40
you know, you go up to anyone and say, you know,

3401
03:24:15.40 --> 03:24:17.40
do you want the government to be in charge of anything?

3402
03:24:17.40 --> 03:24:21.40
You go up to someone with a Mohawk and whatever.

3403
03:24:21.40 --> 03:24:22.40
No way, man.

3404
03:24:22.40 --> 03:24:23.40
No way, man.

3405
03:24:23.40 --> 03:24:28.40
And then you go, cool, why would you vote for the government to be in more charge of more of our lives?

3406
03:24:28.40 --> 03:24:31.40
I just don't think that connection gets made off of enough.

3407
03:24:31.40 --> 03:24:36.40
No, it doesn't, and I deal with this often and since I talked to most not mostly,

3408
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:44.40
but I'm a politician who does a lot more youth engagement than most politicians do.

3409
03:24:44.40 --> 03:24:47.40
And so I address this directly.

3410
03:24:47.40 --> 03:24:50.40
Like, how do you, as a conservative young person,

3411
03:24:50.40 --> 03:24:58.40
how do you make the case for conservatism to your fellow young people who kind of live by this kind of libertarian?

3412
03:24:58.40 --> 03:25:01.40
I mean, what you described is sort of libertarian.

3413
03:25:01.40 --> 03:25:04.40
An extra rebellious libertarian.

3414
03:25:04.40 --> 03:25:07.40
These people who kind of live by this notion of, you know,

3415
03:25:07.40 --> 03:25:17.40
social, progressivism and freedom, but fundamentally, they believe in a kind of Republican form of government that is out of your life and, you know,

3416
03:25:17.40 --> 03:25:22.40
fiscally responsible, you know, they live by this mantra, well, I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative.

3417
03:25:22.40 --> 03:25:23.40
Right? That's what people say.

3418
03:25:23.40 --> 03:25:25.40
And then they vote Democrat, 100%.

3419
03:25:25.40 --> 03:25:30.40
Like, almost 100% of the time. So it's, it's a mantra that makes them feel good,

3420
03:25:30.40 --> 03:25:32.40
but it doesn't mean anything to them.

3421
03:25:32.40 --> 03:25:37.40
And, um, I mean, delving into this is like my life's work at this point.

3422
03:25:37.40 --> 03:25:38.40
Yeah, I feel so unfair.

3423
03:25:38.40 --> 03:25:41.40
And so I'm so glad I don't have to talk about this stuff all the time.

3424
03:25:41.40 --> 03:25:42.40
I'll do it once a year with you.

3425
03:25:42.40 --> 03:25:45.40
Yeah, it's, but it's a super interesting thing.

3426
03:25:45.40 --> 03:25:51.40
And you're like, like, why, why is your entire vote, your entire vote on a political party,

3427
03:25:51.40 --> 03:25:53.40
based on the abortion issue?

3428
03:25:53.40 --> 03:25:55.40
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

3429
03:25:55.40 --> 03:25:58.40
It's not a rational decision. I'm sorry. It's just not.

3430
03:25:58.40 --> 03:26:03.40
Especially because that issue will not affect you, you know, because people will say this and they've got like three kids.

3431
03:26:03.40 --> 03:26:06.40
And they're like, well, and they would never get an abortion themselves.

3432
03:26:06.40 --> 03:26:08.40
It's like, well, this doesn't affect you at all.

3433
03:26:08.40 --> 03:26:10.40
You know, you can make a pretty good argument.

3434
03:26:10.40 --> 03:26:11.40
This should be decided at the state level.

3435
03:26:11.40 --> 03:26:15.40
And yet you are voting 100% because of this issue at the federal level.

3436
03:26:15.40 --> 03:26:17.40
This is not a rational decision.

3437
03:26:17.40 --> 03:26:20.40
And, um, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or game marriage.

3438
03:26:20.40 --> 03:26:23.40
It's like, it's, that's definitely not a rational decision.

3439
03:26:23.40 --> 03:26:25.40
Considering it's not even argued about anymore.

3440
03:26:25.40 --> 03:26:28.40
Like, that's the Supreme Court's done with that one.

3441
03:26:28.40 --> 03:26:34.40
So, it doesn't, you know, it's, it's really surprising, um, to see how people think about these things.

3442
03:26:34.40 --> 03:26:37.40
Um, and, and, and so I guess, bringing it back to the book.

3443
03:26:37.40 --> 03:26:39.40
My point is I'm trying to distinguish there.

3444
03:26:39.40 --> 03:26:45.40
I'm trying to distinguish this into a role of like what, or, to a conversation about what government is actually for.

3445
03:26:45.40 --> 03:26:48.40
And how that manifests into victimhood ideology,

3446
03:26:48.40 --> 03:26:52.40
how that manifests into the story about America because, again, I can,

3447
03:26:52.40 --> 03:27:00.40
I can make it, it's a very short path from victimhood ideology and, and America as an oppressor to hatred of America itself.

3448
03:27:00.40 --> 03:27:02.40
And I only, I only quote the big ones.

3449
03:27:02.40 --> 03:27:06.40
I only quote, you know, Taylor Swift because she's a cultural icon.

3450
03:27:06.40 --> 03:27:10.40
You know, and she's out there saying, if you're not a cisgender white male,

3451
03:27:10.40 --> 03:27:12.40
your rights are being stripped away.

3452
03:27:12.40 --> 03:27:14.40
That's a Taylor Swift quote.

3453
03:27:14.40 --> 03:27:19.40
That's an amazing thing to say from one of the most successful prosperous people in the world.

3454
03:27:19.40 --> 03:27:20.40
Why would she believe that?

3455
03:27:20.40 --> 03:27:27.40
Like, what is happening that she believes this thing, that is so fundamentally not true,

3456
03:27:27.40 --> 03:27:30.40
that is so easy to, to debunk.

3457
03:27:30.40 --> 03:27:33.40
Why would she believe this? Why did AOC believe,

3458
03:27:33.40 --> 03:27:35.40
because she, because that's the next one I quote,

3459
03:27:35.40 --> 03:27:37.40
which is like, oh, what did she say?

3460
03:27:37.40 --> 03:27:40.40
My generation is never known American prosperity.

3461
03:27:40.40 --> 03:27:43.40
How does that make any sense?

3462
03:27:43.40 --> 03:27:49.40
I mean, it, it, it only makes sense in this context where it's good to be really insane.

3463
03:27:49.40 --> 03:27:50.40
Yeah.

3464
03:27:50.40 --> 03:27:55.40
It, it only makes sense when you understand that the goal is to elevate victimhood.

3465
03:27:55.40 --> 03:28:01.40
And then they use that, and then they use that to tear down the story of America itself.

3466
03:28:01.40 --> 03:28:05.40
And it's, it's such a dangerous path that we're on,

3467
03:28:05.40 --> 03:28:10.40
that we want to revolutionize the foundations of our prosperity,

3468
03:28:10.40 --> 03:28:16.40
to such an extent. And again, the only way to justify the only way to make people believe that their eyes are lying to them,

3469
03:28:16.40 --> 03:28:18.40
that all the good things around them are just lies.

3470
03:28:18.40 --> 03:28:21.40
The only way to make them believe that is to constantly,

3471
03:28:21.40 --> 03:28:24.40
it's to constantly hammer them with this crisis narrative,

3472
03:28:24.40 --> 03:28:28.40
with this false narrative that people are trying to oppress them,

3473
03:28:28.40 --> 03:28:31.40
or there's other people being oppressed, and you've never met them,

3474
03:28:31.40 --> 03:28:33.40
but guess what? It's happening.

3475
03:28:33.40 --> 03:28:36.40
And if you don't, and if you don't raise your fist against the injustice,

3476
03:28:36.40 --> 03:28:37.40
then you're part of the problem.

3477
03:28:37.40 --> 03:28:40.40
You win your white privilege.

3478
03:28:40.40 --> 03:28:43.40
This is happening in such an extreme level.

3479
03:28:43.40 --> 03:28:47.40
You know, and it's, again, the good news is,

3480
03:28:47.40 --> 03:28:49.40
is like people listening like, well, I haven't seen it.

3481
03:28:49.40 --> 03:28:52.40
And look good. That's good. But it is happening.

3482
03:28:52.40 --> 03:28:54.40
Yeah, no, I mean, we've got to be aware.

3483
03:28:54.40 --> 03:28:58.40
Like you said, there's evidence, big evidence from real players out there

3484
03:28:58.40 --> 03:29:03.40
that that preach this and live this sort of life.

3485
03:29:03.40 --> 03:29:07.40
It's kind of interesting, man, because we, on this podcast,

3486
03:29:07.40 --> 03:29:09.40
very seldom talk about politics at all.

3487
03:29:09.40 --> 03:29:14.40
And yet, people kind of know where I stand,

3488
03:29:14.40 --> 03:29:17.40
and they kind of, you know, just, it's all good.

3489
03:29:17.40 --> 03:29:23.40
Well, like you said, it is a real thing.

3490
03:29:23.40 --> 03:29:25.40
That is going on. It is a problem.

3491
03:29:25.40 --> 03:29:30.40
And that's one thing that I would say is very nice about your book,

3492
03:29:30.40 --> 03:29:33.40
is that it is a, first of all, it explains it.

3493
03:29:33.40 --> 03:29:38.40
And it gives some pretty good answers on how to move forward.

3494
03:29:38.40 --> 03:29:40.40
And one of the things you do is you, you close out with,

3495
03:29:40.40 --> 03:29:43.40
with an American ethos.

3496
03:29:43.40 --> 03:29:44.40
Yeah.

3497
03:29:44.40 --> 03:29:46.40
Set, you set forth an American ethos in the book.

3498
03:29:46.40 --> 03:29:49.40
Or what I think you called a draft or, you say,

3499
03:29:49.40 --> 03:29:50.40
perhaps it goes something like this.

3500
03:29:50.40 --> 03:29:52.40
And you spell it out.

3501
03:29:52.40 --> 03:29:54.40
Preciate forward.

3502
03:29:54.40 --> 03:29:58.40
Nothing that really anybody would sensibly argue with.

3503
03:29:58.40 --> 03:29:59.40
Right.

3504
03:29:59.40 --> 03:30:02.40
You know, nothing that you could really sensibly argue with.

3505
03:30:02.40 --> 03:30:07.40
And I'll let people get the book and read it.

3506
03:30:07.40 --> 03:30:10.40
But, you know, the last line of it is, you know,

3507
03:30:10.40 --> 03:30:11.40
I will live with fortitude.

3508
03:30:11.40 --> 03:30:13.40
You know, name of the book is fortitude.

3509
03:30:13.40 --> 03:30:17.40
That's sort of the last line of the American ethos that you put forth.

3510
03:30:17.40 --> 03:30:20.40
And that's a simple statement, right?

3511
03:30:20.40 --> 03:30:24.40
It's a simple statement, but it's something that you can actually carry with you

3512
03:30:24.40 --> 03:30:25.40
in every part of your life.

3513
03:30:25.40 --> 03:30:28.40
And the way you tie fortitude into all these other aspects of,

3514
03:30:28.40 --> 03:30:31.40
how to deal with other people, how to react to things.

3515
03:30:31.40 --> 03:30:33.40
That is what the book is about.

3516
03:30:33.40 --> 03:30:36.40
And it really sets forth a,

3517
03:30:36.40 --> 03:30:41.40
a great path for people to go down to get their themselves,

3518
03:30:41.40 --> 03:30:51.40
their family, their country into a more stable and productive and better place.

3519
03:30:51.40 --> 03:30:57.40
So, I've read, I'll just tell you a fraction of the book today.

3520
03:30:57.40 --> 03:31:00.40
Whoever, what you should do is order this book right now.

3521
03:31:00.40 --> 03:31:02.40
Now, here's something that you haven't ran into yet, Dan.

3522
03:31:02.40 --> 03:31:04.40
You're publisher.

3523
03:31:04.40 --> 03:31:08.40
Your publisher is, first of all, they're underestimating you.

3524
03:31:08.40 --> 03:31:12.40
They're underestimating the people that want to hear this message.

3525
03:31:12.40 --> 03:31:15.40
So, they're only going to print X amount of books.

3526
03:31:15.40 --> 03:31:17.40
They're looking at pre-sales.

3527
03:31:17.40 --> 03:31:20.40
They're like, okay, we're only going to print X amount of books.

3528
03:31:20.40 --> 03:31:21.40
Because it's investment.

3529
03:31:21.40 --> 03:31:22.40
It's a risk for them.

3530
03:31:22.40 --> 03:31:25.40
And then what happens is, the book comes out.

3531
03:31:25.40 --> 03:31:27.40
People start to read it.

3532
03:31:27.40 --> 03:31:28.40
It catches on fire.

3533
03:31:28.40 --> 03:31:32.40
And then all of a sudden, there are four weeks out from printing more books.

3534
03:31:32.40 --> 03:31:36.40
So, what people need to do right now is pre-order the book.

3535
03:31:36.40 --> 03:31:37.40
Pre-order the book.

3536
03:31:37.40 --> 03:31:39.40
Which makes the publisher then print more.

3537
03:31:39.40 --> 03:31:44.40
Also, I should note, all pre-orders are getting a signed book plate.

3538
03:31:44.40 --> 03:31:46.40
Oh, all of them.

3539
03:31:46.40 --> 03:31:47.40
Ouch.

3540
03:31:47.40 --> 03:31:49.40
Yeah, my hand hurts.

3541
03:31:49.40 --> 03:31:51.40
Yeah, that's not fun.

3542
03:31:51.40 --> 03:31:54.40
So, what do the book write now?

3543
03:31:54.40 --> 03:31:57.40
We'll have it on our website so you guys can click through and order it.

3544
03:31:57.40 --> 03:31:59.40
Well, I need to clarify that.

3545
03:31:59.40 --> 03:32:07.40
You have to go to dancrenchabbook.com slash pre-order to upload your receipt so that we know you pre-order it and can actually get you the book plate.

3546
03:32:07.40 --> 03:32:08.40
You know what?

3547
03:32:08.40 --> 03:32:10.40
If you do that, you get the book plate.

3548
03:32:10.40 --> 03:32:12.40
I've been putting out that website pretty calm.

3549
03:32:12.40 --> 03:32:13.40
Yeah, cool.

3550
03:32:13.40 --> 03:32:15.40
I'm going to take this as a personal challenge to see if I can break you.

3551
03:32:15.40 --> 03:32:20.40
Get so many freaking pre-orders that you have to sign book plates for leg.

3552
03:32:20.40 --> 03:32:21.40
I love this.

3553
03:32:21.40 --> 03:32:23.40
This, I mean, do something hard.

3554
03:32:23.40 --> 03:32:25.40
You know, sign one million book plates.

3555
03:32:25.40 --> 03:32:26.40
Do something hard.

3556
03:32:26.40 --> 03:32:27.40
That is nasty.

3557
03:32:27.40 --> 03:32:28.40
Really?

3558
03:32:28.40 --> 03:32:30.40
You actually have a podcast now.

3559
03:32:30.40 --> 03:32:33.40
Your own podcast, which is called Hold These Truths.

3560
03:32:33.40 --> 03:32:34.40
Yeah.

3561
03:32:34.40 --> 03:32:35.40
Tell us about that podcast a little bit.

3562
03:32:35.40 --> 03:32:38.40
So, I'm always looking for ways to communicate.

3563
03:32:38.40 --> 03:32:40.40
It's my job.

3564
03:32:40.40 --> 03:32:45.40
I've got to communicate the truth and the policies that I believe are right.

3565
03:32:45.40 --> 03:32:47.40
And the things we're voting on in Washington.

3566
03:32:47.40 --> 03:32:50.40
So, I do that a ton on social media as everybody knows that.

3567
03:32:50.40 --> 03:32:55.40
And there's, there's, you know, there's a different method of communicating for every platform.

3568
03:32:55.40 --> 03:33:04.40
And one thing that you can't do on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter is have really lengthy conversations and deep dives into policy issues.

3569
03:33:04.40 --> 03:33:06.40
So, I do that on the podcast.

3570
03:33:06.40 --> 03:33:15.40
And, you know, it started because I'm like, you know, I get these five-minute conversations during hearings when I have a really interesting witness come and talk about something.

3571
03:33:15.40 --> 03:33:20.40
And maybe I'll meet with that person later, too. And it's a really interesting conversation.

3572
03:33:20.40 --> 03:33:23.40
And I ask some, you know, questions that I need answered.

3573
03:33:23.40 --> 03:33:26.40
Why don't we record that?

3574
03:33:26.40 --> 03:33:27.40
Why don't we dive into these things?

3575
03:33:27.40 --> 03:33:31.40
And so, what you'll find from that podcast is a whole variety of issues.

3576
03:33:31.40 --> 03:33:34.40
You know, one day it'll be about Iran or China.

3577
03:33:34.40 --> 03:33:36.40
Another day it'll be about student loans.

3578
03:33:36.40 --> 03:33:39.40
I've interviewed the previous head of the ACLU.

3579
03:33:39.40 --> 03:33:40.40
We'll talk about free speech.

3580
03:33:40.40 --> 03:33:43.40
We'll talk about, you know, discrimination law.

3581
03:33:43.40 --> 03:33:45.40
Make sense in these conditions.

3582
03:33:45.40 --> 03:33:48.40
Like, there's some really fascinating deep dives.

3583
03:33:48.40 --> 03:33:50.40
We'll talk about 5G.

3584
03:33:50.40 --> 03:33:52.40
We'll talk about Bitcoin.

3585
03:33:52.40 --> 03:33:55.40
I mean, a whole variety of things.

3586
03:33:55.40 --> 03:33:59.40
Medicare for all, the environment, the green-new deal, all of this stuff.

3587
03:33:59.40 --> 03:34:02.40
And we're talking to actual experts on the subjects.

3588
03:34:02.40 --> 03:34:06.40
I'll say that your job gives you access to people that actually know what they're talking about.

3589
03:34:06.40 --> 03:34:08.40
Yeah. They'll come and talk to me.

3590
03:34:08.40 --> 03:34:10.40
And are you bringing on people that you don't agree with?

3591
03:34:10.40 --> 03:34:14.40
Well, I've gotten into debates with some for sure.

3592
03:34:14.40 --> 03:34:16.40
Especially head of the ACLU.

3593
03:34:16.40 --> 03:34:18.40
We probably could do more of that.

3594
03:34:18.40 --> 03:34:19.40
It just started.

3595
03:34:19.40 --> 03:34:24.40
So I'm trying to build up a library right now of just deep dives into certain policies.

3596
03:34:24.40 --> 03:34:27.40
Or I'm kind of just asking the questions.

3597
03:34:27.40 --> 03:34:31.40
Because, you know, the way we went at this podcast,

3598
03:34:31.40 --> 03:34:34.40
too, is like, I don't have time to prepare for it.

3599
03:34:34.40 --> 03:34:39.40
And I'm too busy to take the time to really prepare a podcast the way you are preparing your podcast.

3600
03:34:39.40 --> 03:34:40.40
Each time.

3601
03:34:40.40 --> 03:34:43.40
It's not feasible for me.

3602
03:34:43.40 --> 03:34:48.40
What's more feasible is that I'm just a genuinely curious person talking to another person who knows a lot of things.

3603
03:34:48.40 --> 03:34:50.40
That I can take an hour out and do.

3604
03:34:50.40 --> 03:34:53.40
And I think it ends up being pretty good.

3605
03:34:53.40 --> 03:34:53.40
Yeah.

3606
03:34:53.40 --> 03:35:02.40
And so, you know, we haven't had a full-on debate on a podcast yet.

3607
03:35:02.40 --> 03:35:06.40
And haven't figured out how I would even structure that if we were to.

3608
03:35:06.40 --> 03:35:09.40
Because I debate on my public life so often.

3609
03:35:09.40 --> 03:35:10.40
It's like, you know, I don't know.

3610
03:35:10.40 --> 03:35:15.40
He's not only, I don't need to put it on the podcast either, but I've been to a lot of people like to watch it though.

3611
03:35:15.40 --> 03:35:16.40
Yeah.

3612
03:35:16.40 --> 03:35:19.40
I mean, I think it would be nice because you could be in a situation where they're not constrained by time.

3613
03:35:19.40 --> 03:35:21.40
If you got somebody else that was sane.

3614
03:35:21.40 --> 03:35:22.40
Yeah.

3615
03:35:22.40 --> 03:35:30.40
That had a different viewpoint on this area of the thing where you could actually discuss and maybe make some mutual forward progress

3616
03:35:30.40 --> 03:35:35.40
between, you know, coming to better ideas or more mutually agreed upon ideas that might be nice.

3617
03:35:35.40 --> 03:35:42.40
You are on Instagram at Dan Crenshaw TX, which is for Texas echo.

3618
03:35:42.40 --> 03:35:44.40
In case you didn't know that.

3619
03:35:44.40 --> 03:35:49.40
Facebook, Dan Crenshaw, at Dan Crenshaw, and you also have your website, which is Crenshaw for Congress.

3620
03:35:49.40 --> 03:35:51.40
Is that where the book is as well?

3621
03:35:51.40 --> 03:35:52.40
Or no.

3622
03:35:52.40 --> 03:35:53.40
No.

3623
03:35:53.40 --> 03:35:53.40
No.

3624
03:35:53.40 --> 03:35:54.40
That's the book.

3625
03:35:54.40 --> 03:35:55.40
The book is Dan Crenshaw book.com.

3626
03:35:55.40 --> 03:35:56.40
Got it.

3627
03:35:56.40 --> 03:35:57.40
You're like your branding.

3628
03:35:57.40 --> 03:35:58.40
It's just like mine.

3629
03:35:58.40 --> 03:35:59.40
My name.

3630
03:35:59.40 --> 03:36:00.40
Yeah.

3631
03:36:00.40 --> 03:36:01.40
That's the book.

3632
03:36:01.40 --> 03:36:02.40
Exactly.

3633
03:36:02.40 --> 03:36:10.40
Did I miss anything as far as like all this stuff as far as getting in touch with you and all that?

3634
03:36:10.40 --> 03:36:11.40
No.

3635
03:36:11.40 --> 03:36:13.40
I mean, it's easy to find me on social media.

3636
03:36:13.40 --> 03:36:14.40
You have to keep in mind.

3637
03:36:14.40 --> 03:36:17.40
Here's some annoyances about how my social media works.

3638
03:36:17.40 --> 03:36:18.40
On Instagram, I have one account.

3639
03:36:18.40 --> 03:36:19.40
Okay.

3640
03:36:19.40 --> 03:36:20.40
It's my personal account.

3641
03:36:20.40 --> 03:36:21.40
It's not really official.

3642
03:36:21.40 --> 03:36:23.40
It's not really campaign.

3643
03:36:23.40 --> 03:36:28.40
But the way the rules work, you have to generally differentiate between a official and

3644
03:36:28.40 --> 03:36:31.40
campaign, which is why there's two Facebook accounts, which is why there's two Twitter accounts.

3645
03:36:31.40 --> 03:36:35.40
And you have to follow all of them to get all the information.

3646
03:36:35.40 --> 03:36:38.40
Instagram, if you're an Instagram user, it's a little easier for you.

3647
03:36:38.40 --> 03:36:41.40
I just, because I control that's my personal account.

3648
03:36:41.40 --> 03:36:46.40
And that's why you just have to search for me a couple times and then follow both.

3649
03:36:46.40 --> 03:36:48.40
That's the only thing I would add.

3650
03:36:48.40 --> 03:36:49.40
Got it.

3651
03:36:49.40 --> 03:36:55.40
Now, Dan, I know you're doing a lot for America, which is definitely appreciated.

3652
03:36:55.40 --> 03:37:00.40
But I want you to know that we're doing our part over here as well in the private sector.

3653
03:37:00.40 --> 03:37:04.40
We're working hard to make people better.

3654
03:37:04.40 --> 03:37:05.40
Yes.

3655
03:37:05.40 --> 03:37:07.40
To make the economy better.

3656
03:37:07.40 --> 03:37:16.40
And to rebuild the foundation of America, on at least one foundation of America, and that is self-reliance and our ability to create and build the best products in the world.

3657
03:37:16.40 --> 03:37:18.40
100% American made.

3658
03:37:18.40 --> 03:37:20.40
But I say 100% American made.

3659
03:37:20.40 --> 03:37:21.40
Yes.

3660
03:37:21.40 --> 03:37:22.40
Yeah.

3661
03:37:22.40 --> 03:37:23.40
100% American made.

3662
03:37:23.40 --> 03:37:25.40
In three years, I think it's three years.

3663
03:37:25.40 --> 03:37:28.40
We've gone from eight employees to 80.

3664
03:37:28.40 --> 03:37:31.40
We are just getting warmed up.

3665
03:37:31.40 --> 03:37:33.40
A little company up in Maine.

3666
03:37:33.40 --> 03:37:34.40
Yes.

3667
03:37:34.40 --> 03:37:37.40
My home state, my home region, I should say.

3668
03:37:37.40 --> 03:37:38.40
I'm a New Englander.

3669
03:37:38.40 --> 03:37:39.40
Yeah.

3670
03:37:39.40 --> 03:37:41.40
Because I got time in Connecticut and Maine.

3671
03:37:41.40 --> 03:37:43.40
But I can acclaim it a little bit.

3672
03:37:43.40 --> 03:37:44.40
My home record is Maine.

3673
03:37:44.40 --> 03:37:45.40
Yes, you can claim it.

3674
03:37:45.40 --> 03:37:47.40
So up there, we got a little factory.

3675
03:37:47.40 --> 03:37:48.40
That's true.

3676
03:37:48.40 --> 03:37:50.40
We got a little something called a origin Maine.

3677
03:37:50.40 --> 03:37:51.40
Tell us about a deco Charles.

3678
03:37:51.40 --> 03:37:52.40
Okay.

3679
03:37:52.40 --> 03:37:53.40
Oh, well.

3680
03:37:53.40 --> 03:37:55.40
Oh, by the way, we are getting softer.

3681
03:37:55.40 --> 03:37:56.40
By the way.

3682
03:37:56.40 --> 03:37:58.40
I think it's a good idea.

3683
03:37:58.40 --> 03:38:01.40
Generally speaking, as a group, we are all getting softer.

3684
03:38:01.40 --> 03:38:03.40
That's why generation after generation.

3685
03:38:03.40 --> 03:38:06.40
They say, oh, my generation was harder than this new generation.

3686
03:38:06.40 --> 03:38:07.40
That's why they always say it.

3687
03:38:07.40 --> 03:38:08.40
You're saying it factually.

3688
03:38:08.40 --> 03:38:09.40
It's factually.

3689
03:38:09.40 --> 03:38:12.40
And this is why generally speaking, as true individuals,

3690
03:38:12.40 --> 03:38:14.40
there's variations in individuals for sure.

3691
03:38:14.40 --> 03:38:16.40
And even little micro groups for sure,

3692
03:38:16.40 --> 03:38:17.40
variation.

3693
03:38:17.40 --> 03:38:23.40
But there's why technology, the whole reason for technology is to solve our problems.

3694
03:38:23.40 --> 03:38:24.40
Just to make things easier.

3695
03:38:24.40 --> 03:38:25.40
Make everything easier, exactly right.

3696
03:38:25.40 --> 03:38:30.40
And I'd say I like to look not like to, but I look at it as to solve our problems,

3697
03:38:30.40 --> 03:38:32.40
which is making things easier for sure.

3698
03:38:32.40 --> 03:38:35.40
So even like the caveman, right, when they invented the wheel,

3699
03:38:35.40 --> 03:38:38.40
all these softies, they got the wheel now.

3700
03:38:38.40 --> 03:38:40.40
Now, assume saying, because before that generation,

3701
03:38:40.40 --> 03:38:42.40
we had to carry stuff.

3702
03:38:42.40 --> 03:38:44.40
I mean, they're objectively harder.

3703
03:38:44.40 --> 03:38:46.40
I think objectively speaking.

3704
03:38:46.40 --> 03:38:47.40
I think so.

3705
03:38:47.40 --> 03:38:49.40
It's not a bad thing that we've made things easier.

3706
03:38:49.40 --> 03:38:51.40
But right, you have to art.

3707
03:38:51.40 --> 03:38:53.40
It was just kind of the whole point of the chapter.

3708
03:38:53.40 --> 03:38:54.40
Do something hard.

3709
03:38:54.40 --> 03:38:56.40
You have to make up for that.

3710
03:38:56.40 --> 03:38:57.40
Yeah, you have to make up for that.

3711
03:38:57.40 --> 03:39:00.40
Art officially, yeah, hardening your own life.

3712
03:39:00.40 --> 03:39:01.40
Oh, yeah.

3713
03:39:01.40 --> 03:39:03.40
And that's why this is like your book is good.

3714
03:39:03.40 --> 03:39:05.40
That's why what you say is good is because, right, we can't,

3715
03:39:05.40 --> 03:39:09.40
this is a wave, a wave of just easiness coming on us.

3716
03:39:09.40 --> 03:39:11.40
There's no stopping it.

3717
03:39:11.40 --> 03:39:14.40
But individually, we can kind of like fight against,

3718
03:39:14.40 --> 03:39:16.40
not necessarily the wave, but the results of the wave.

3719
03:39:16.40 --> 03:39:18.40
Yeah, I'm saying.

3720
03:39:18.40 --> 03:39:19.40
You can do something hard.

3721
03:39:19.40 --> 03:39:20.40
Yeah.

3722
03:39:20.40 --> 03:39:23.40
So what you get, though, what you will get inevitably is everyone with all

3723
03:39:23.40 --> 03:39:24.40
their problem solved.

3724
03:39:24.40 --> 03:39:26.40
And we're always looking for these little issues.

3725
03:39:26.40 --> 03:39:27.40
Yeah.

3726
03:39:27.40 --> 03:39:29.40
Because that's how, right, that's nature.

3727
03:39:29.40 --> 03:39:33.40
So now it's like, hey, that's some injustice right there.

3728
03:39:33.40 --> 03:39:39.40
Yeah, it's a lot, it's a lot harder to complain about the injustice of your wife,

3729
03:39:39.40 --> 03:39:43.40
and your neighborhood, not being as strong as it's if you don't got food on your

3730
03:39:43.40 --> 03:39:44.40
plate.

3731
03:39:44.40 --> 03:39:45.40
Right.

3732
03:39:45.40 --> 03:39:49.40
And it's, you don't have to think about like your kids know, right?

3733
03:39:49.40 --> 03:39:51.40
Where it's like, oh, yeah, they got to wear helmets now.

3734
03:39:51.40 --> 03:39:54.40
So you can say, hey, you guys got to wear seat belts now.

3735
03:39:54.40 --> 03:39:57.40
So I get into like a 1965 something.

3736
03:39:57.40 --> 03:39:58.40
Yeah.

3737
03:39:58.40 --> 03:39:59.40
Right.

3738
03:39:59.40 --> 03:39:59.40
You're going to die in that thing.

3739
03:39:59.40 --> 03:40:02.40
It seems like it's the same, but that was just how bad that.

3740
03:40:02.40 --> 03:40:03.40
Yeah.

3741
03:40:03.40 --> 03:40:07.40
Now getting your 2020, whatever Tesla and probably you can fall asleep behind the wheel.

3742
03:40:07.40 --> 03:40:08.40
You're safe.

3743
03:40:08.40 --> 03:40:09.40
Yeah.

3744
03:40:09.40 --> 03:40:10.40
They've got you.

3745
03:40:10.40 --> 03:40:11.40
No problem exactly.

3746
03:40:11.40 --> 03:40:12.40
Right.

3747
03:40:12.40 --> 03:40:13.40
All your problems solved.

3748
03:40:13.40 --> 03:40:17.40
So that's how, you know, it's like, you know, all these groups of people,

3749
03:40:17.40 --> 03:40:21.40
like, very small groups of people, but they're super loud because they can be now.

3750
03:40:21.40 --> 03:40:26.40
That's just how like back in the day you could not out hunting down elk for the bow and arrow.

3751
03:40:26.40 --> 03:40:27.40
Yeah.

3752
03:40:27.40 --> 03:40:31.40
And not to mention the technology allows all this, you know, so yeah, and they're louder

3753
03:40:31.40 --> 03:40:37.40
whatever, but you make a good point where it's like, yeah, if you go out and look for all these

3754
03:40:37.40 --> 03:40:39.40
issues, it's like, it's hard to find them.

3755
03:40:39.40 --> 03:40:43.40
But you're how you say like Ben Shapiro and Dan, they're in ground zero.

3756
03:40:43.40 --> 03:40:46.40
Oh, the ground man can't is that.

3757
03:40:46.40 --> 03:40:47.40
That is better ground.

3758
03:40:47.40 --> 03:40:48.40
Yeah.

3759
03:40:48.40 --> 03:40:49.40
So it's going to seem pretty bad.

3760
03:40:49.40 --> 03:40:51.40
On the last, yes.

3761
03:40:51.40 --> 03:40:56.40
So yes, uh, keep up good fight against the weight of wealth.

3762
03:40:56.40 --> 03:40:57.40
Doing hard things.

3763
03:40:57.40 --> 03:40:58.40
What hard things you got for us?

3764
03:40:58.40 --> 03:40:59.40
Echo Charles, what can we do?

3765
03:40:59.40 --> 03:41:02.40
Gigiatsu, hard daily hard hardships.

3766
03:41:02.40 --> 03:41:04.40
Oh, day daily hardships.

3767
03:41:04.40 --> 03:41:10.40
You know, working out fitness, Gigiatsu and I wasn't going to say fashion, but that's more

3768
03:41:10.40 --> 03:41:13.40
you're a shoe.

3769
03:41:13.40 --> 03:41:14.40
That's hard for you.

3770
03:41:14.40 --> 03:41:15.40
You see, okay.

3771
03:41:15.40 --> 03:41:17.40
Anyway, so when we do Gigiatsu, what are we doing?

3772
03:41:17.40 --> 03:41:20.40
Gigi, we don't Gigi, we don't know Gigi.

3773
03:41:20.40 --> 03:41:25.40
No Gigi, if you get a Gigi, get an origin Gigi, for all the reasons you mentioned.

3774
03:41:25.40 --> 03:41:26.40
Yeah.

3775
03:41:26.40 --> 03:41:28.40
We'll get you up to the factory up in Maine, Dan.

3776
03:41:28.40 --> 03:41:29.40
Yeah.

3777
03:41:29.40 --> 03:41:30.40
You got to go check it out.

3778
03:41:30.40 --> 03:41:31.40
It's, um, it's awesome.

3779
03:41:31.40 --> 03:41:32.40
It's awesome.

3780
03:41:32.40 --> 03:41:38.40
We literally brought the last, about the last loom in Lewiston, Maine from a 500,000 square

3781
03:41:38.40 --> 03:41:42.40
foot of abandoned factory that hadn't been used in 20 years and all the other hundreds and

3782
03:41:42.40 --> 03:41:44.40
hundreds of looms from that factory, sent overseas.

3783
03:41:44.40 --> 03:41:46.40
We're bringing it back.

3784
03:41:46.40 --> 03:41:47.40
We had one loom.

3785
03:41:47.40 --> 03:41:49.40
Now I think we got four looms.

3786
03:41:49.40 --> 03:41:51.40
We're, we're, we're bringing it back.

3787
03:41:51.40 --> 03:41:56.40
And, uh, and, you know, the folks up there, these are folks that their industry was

3788
03:41:56.40 --> 03:41:57.40
taken away from them.

3789
03:41:57.40 --> 03:41:59.40
Their industry was sold overseas.

3790
03:41:59.40 --> 03:42:01.40
And now they're back.

3791
03:42:01.40 --> 03:42:04.40
Craftsman, crafts, women.

3792
03:42:04.40 --> 03:42:10.40
Sowing, making boots, making jeans, all in America from, and every, like every single

3793
03:42:10.40 --> 03:42:13.40
part of those jeans is American.

3794
03:42:13.40 --> 03:42:14.40
Yeah.

3795
03:42:14.40 --> 03:42:19.40
This is such an important, I want to bring it to a little bit of politics and how I view this

3796
03:42:19.40 --> 03:42:28.40
and the need to, to embrace some sense of American economic nationalism, which we've

3797
03:42:28.40 --> 03:42:29.40
lost over time.

3798
03:42:29.40 --> 03:42:33.40
And the rise of Trump, when people ask about how the Republican party has changed under Trump,

3799
03:42:33.40 --> 03:42:35.40
what they're, it's usually a disingenuous question.

3800
03:42:35.40 --> 03:42:39.40
What they want you to say is that Republicans are racist, right?

3801
03:42:39.40 --> 03:42:44.40
That's really what they're insinuating when they ask that question or that they're more racist now.

3802
03:42:44.40 --> 03:42:45.40
That's not true.

3803
03:42:45.40 --> 03:42:47.40
But there is some change.

3804
03:42:47.40 --> 03:42:53.40
And this, this drive towards a, to, to a conversation about economic nationalism is actually part of that change.

3805
03:42:53.40 --> 03:42:54.40
And it's been interesting to watch.

3806
03:42:54.40 --> 03:42:56.40
And I think it's a necessary change.

3807
03:42:56.40 --> 03:42:59.40
Because what Trump got was a lot of democrat voters who,

3808
03:42:59.40 --> 03:43:04.40
maybe voted, democrat their whole life, but they're part of a union, culturally speaking,

3809
03:43:04.40 --> 03:43:09.40
they identify a hell of a lot more with me than they do AOC.

3810
03:43:09.40 --> 03:43:10.40
Okay.

3811
03:43:10.40 --> 03:43:12.40
So they started voting based on that.

3812
03:43:12.40 --> 03:43:16.40
But also, Trump finally talked about some things they were concerned about, which was like,

3813
03:43:16.40 --> 03:43:22.40
China, okay, China, taking advantage of us, NAFTA, taking advantage of us.

3814
03:43:22.40 --> 03:43:26.40
And the reality is that's, that's a, that's a nuanced conversation.

3815
03:43:26.40 --> 03:43:31.40
It's not, it's not, it's different for every factory to be honest.

3816
03:43:31.40 --> 03:43:34.40
It's, sometimes it's the business itself that sucked.

3817
03:43:34.40 --> 03:43:37.40
Sometimes it is Chinese dumping that occurred.

3818
03:43:37.40 --> 03:43:38.40
All right.

3819
03:43:38.40 --> 03:43:40.40
Sometimes it, it's just, it's a mix of things.

3820
03:43:40.40 --> 03:43:48.40
But Republicans for too long, it here to, to a, to a highly stringent free market economy,

3821
03:43:48.40 --> 03:43:51.40
dogmatic approach, which said,

3822
03:43:51.40 --> 03:43:54.40
if another country can make it cheaper, they should make it.

3823
03:43:54.40 --> 03:43:57.40
All right. That's just, that's economics 101, we're done.

3824
03:43:57.40 --> 03:43:59.40
No more thinking about it.

3825
03:43:59.40 --> 03:44:01.40
Well, that's, that's not that simple.

3826
03:44:01.40 --> 03:44:05.40
Like, there's winners and losers here, just because like tomatoes are now five cents cheaper for everybody,

3827
03:44:05.40 --> 03:44:07.40
doesn't mean that we're all better off.

3828
03:44:07.40 --> 03:44:10.40
You know, we've thousands of farmers that no longer make tomatoes.

3829
03:44:10.40 --> 03:44:12.40
Also, we don't make tomatoes.

3830
03:44:12.40 --> 03:44:15.40
And now, by the way, again, let's bring back some coronavirus,

3831
03:44:15.40 --> 03:44:19.40
we've got a real conversation in this country to have about medical device,

3832
03:44:19.40 --> 03:44:23.40
manufacturing and supply lines of our medical industry.

3833
03:44:23.40 --> 03:44:25.40
And computer industry and everything else.

3834
03:44:25.40 --> 03:44:30.40
Like, there is benefit, even if it costs us more, there is benefit to having that here in America.

3835
03:44:30.40 --> 03:44:35.40
It's a real benefit, not just the job, the manufacturing jobs are certainly some of those benefits,

3836
03:44:35.40 --> 03:44:38.40
but there's a national security reason as well.

3837
03:44:38.40 --> 03:44:44.40
And it's about time we have a more honest conversation about that as Republicans.

3838
03:44:44.40 --> 03:44:46.40
Democrats will just be against Trump no matter what.

3839
03:44:46.40 --> 03:44:49.40
So like, because they don't, they're not really principled in this.

3840
03:44:49.40 --> 03:44:53.40
They're mostly about seeking power for the sake of the revolution.

3841
03:44:53.40 --> 03:44:55.40
And I could go way back into that again.

3842
03:44:55.40 --> 03:45:03.40
But, and so, you know, I, we just, I think that's an interesting point.

3843
03:45:03.40 --> 03:45:05.40
Is, is where I want to end that.

3844
03:45:05.40 --> 03:45:06.40
And so I love what you guys are doing.

3845
03:45:06.40 --> 03:45:08.40
I guess is what I'm really trying to say.

3846
03:45:08.40 --> 03:45:10.40
Yeah, well, it's, and you know, we got this right now.

3847
03:45:10.40 --> 03:45:12.40
Again, you're talking coronavirus.

3848
03:45:12.40 --> 03:45:14.40
We got 100% American supply chain.

3849
03:45:14.40 --> 03:45:16.40
So zero impact.

3850
03:45:16.40 --> 03:45:20.40
Zero impact. It's, it's just, it's, it's awesome.

3851
03:45:20.40 --> 03:45:25.40
And yeah, you're talking about the, the Chinese are making a bunch of the, what 95% of the pharmaceuticals are something crazy.

3852
03:45:25.40 --> 03:45:26.40
There's crazy number like that.

3853
03:45:26.40 --> 03:45:27.40
Yeah.

3854
03:45:27.40 --> 03:45:28.40
That's not okay.

3855
03:45:28.40 --> 03:45:29.40
That's not okay.

3856
03:45:29.40 --> 03:45:33.40
And yeah, if you save five cents on something, that's not okay when something happens.

3857
03:45:33.40 --> 03:45:38.40
Even if it was, even if it was just a natural disaster that, that caused problems over there.

3858
03:45:38.40 --> 03:45:40.40
You know, no, no political anything.

3859
03:45:40.40 --> 03:45:42.40
That's a real problem.

3860
03:45:42.40 --> 03:45:48.40
And to, to have single source for life, life saving capabilities, that's a bad plan.

3861
03:45:48.40 --> 03:45:53.40
And hopefully we look back at this coronavirus and we say, hey, I'm glad we got a heads up.

3862
03:45:53.40 --> 03:45:55.40
I'm glad we got a free lesson.

3863
03:45:55.40 --> 03:45:58.40
Relatively cheap lessons learned about this.

3864
03:45:58.40 --> 03:46:02.40
So anyways, up in Maine, doing it.

3865
03:46:02.40 --> 03:46:03.40
We're doing it.

3866
03:46:03.40 --> 03:46:04.40
We're doing it right now.

3867
03:46:04.40 --> 03:46:05.40
We've been doing it.

3868
03:46:05.40 --> 03:46:07.40
And we're going to continue to grow.

3869
03:46:07.40 --> 03:46:09.40
We're going to continue to get out the best products.

3870
03:46:09.40 --> 03:46:12.40
We're going to do that.

3871
03:46:12.40 --> 03:46:14.40
We're going to continue to grow.

3872
03:46:14.40 --> 03:46:17.40
So we can supplement to supplementation as as aquatiles like to call it.

3873
03:46:17.40 --> 03:46:18.40
True.

3874
03:46:18.40 --> 03:46:19.40
From time to time.

3875
03:46:19.40 --> 03:46:22.40
So for supplementation, what?

3876
03:46:22.40 --> 03:46:23.40
Join supplement.

3877
03:46:23.40 --> 03:46:24.40
Very important.

3878
03:46:24.40 --> 03:46:25.40
By the way, yeah.

3879
03:46:25.40 --> 03:46:26.40
Join.

3880
03:46:26.40 --> 03:46:27.40
I should probably take some of this.

3881
03:46:27.40 --> 03:46:27.40
Yeah.

3882
03:46:27.40 --> 03:46:29.40
I brought what you can do like if you joins don't work.

3883
03:46:29.40 --> 03:46:30.40
Yeah, not much.

3884
03:46:30.40 --> 03:46:31.40
Just get new ones.

3885
03:46:31.40 --> 03:46:32.40
Yeah.

3886
03:46:32.40 --> 03:46:33.40
Yep, there's that technology.

3887
03:46:33.40 --> 03:46:35.40
By the way, yeah.

3888
03:46:35.40 --> 03:46:36.40
Also.

3889
03:46:36.40 --> 03:46:37.40
Moq.

3890
03:46:37.40 --> 03:46:39.000
It's more of a dessert.

3891
03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:42.40
It's a dessert that happens to have a bunch of protein in it,

3892
03:46:42.40 --> 03:46:44.20
and probiotics, and it has no sugar

3893
03:46:44.20 --> 03:46:46.68
and it's super healthy and it tastes delicious.

3894
03:46:46.68 --> 03:46:49.40
Technology, it's skeptical of the delicious part.

3895
03:46:49.40 --> 03:46:50.64
That's what's crazy.

3896
03:46:50.64 --> 03:46:51.64
I love dessert.

3897
03:46:51.64 --> 03:46:53.04
That's what's crazy.

3898
03:46:53.04 --> 03:46:53.88
That's what's crazy.

3899
03:46:53.88 --> 03:46:55.92
That's what has got so many people,

3900
03:46:55.92 --> 03:46:58.16
officially on the malt train.

3901
03:46:58.16 --> 03:46:59.76
I train so much dessert.

3902
03:46:59.76 --> 03:47:03.000
I will send you what flavor of these flavors,

3903
03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:07.60
chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip,

3904
03:47:07.60 --> 03:47:09.56
which is my personal favorite.

3905
03:47:09.56 --> 03:47:11.76
Reces peanut butter cup, and I know I can't call it that,

3906
03:47:11.76 --> 03:47:12.72
but that's what it tastes like.

3907
03:47:12.72 --> 03:47:13.88
Peanut butter chocolate, what's that?

3908
03:47:13.88 --> 03:47:14.72
Peanut butter chocolate.

3909
03:47:14.72 --> 03:47:16.04
I'll pick the peanut butter chocolate.

3910
03:47:16.04 --> 03:47:18.52
And then here's the one that's kind of the creeper,

3911
03:47:18.52 --> 03:47:20.24
or the, what's it called?

3912
03:47:20.24 --> 03:47:21.08
Creep?

3913
03:47:21.08 --> 03:47:21.92
No, the sleeper.

3914
03:47:21.92 --> 03:47:23.64
The sleeper is strawberry.

3915
03:47:24.48 --> 03:47:27.000
So did you ever have strawberry quick when you were a kid?

3916
03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:27.84
Yeah.

3917
03:47:27.84 --> 03:47:28.68
Did you write it?

3918
03:47:28.68 --> 03:47:29.52
Yes.

3919
03:47:29.52 --> 03:47:30.68
Okay, I'm not kidding.

3920
03:47:30.68 --> 03:47:33.08
I'm not kidding.

3921
03:47:33.08 --> 03:47:38.08
Strawberry moch tastes better than strawberry quick.

3922
03:47:38.08 --> 03:47:39.12
No.

3923
03:47:39.12 --> 03:47:41.52
I'm telling you like a competitive,

3924
03:47:41.52 --> 03:47:42.68
is it a liquid way?

3925
03:47:42.68 --> 03:47:45.40
Can we back, because my preference for flavor

3926
03:47:45.40 --> 03:47:47.96
does depend on the substance that we have.

3927
03:47:47.96 --> 03:47:49.36
Yeah, it's like a milk shake.

3928
03:47:49.36 --> 03:47:50.76
Milk shake, it's like a milk shake.

3929
03:47:50.76 --> 03:47:52.52
It's like a milk shake or a chocolate milk or a,

3930
03:47:52.52 --> 03:47:53.56
or a nest is quick.

3931
03:47:53.56 --> 03:47:54.56
Okay.

3932
03:47:54.56 --> 03:47:55.76
Well, you can make the strawberry.

3933
03:47:55.76 --> 03:47:56.60
What?

3934
03:47:56.60 --> 03:47:57.56
You can make pink pink.

3935
03:47:57.56 --> 03:47:58.84
You can put milk in pretty much anything.

3936
03:47:58.84 --> 03:48:02.92
Okay, okay, so based on the fact that it's more like a milk shake,

3937
03:48:02.92 --> 03:48:05.48
then I would, yeah, then I would say not the peanut butter.

3938
03:48:05.48 --> 03:48:06.92
I do like peanut butter milk shake,

3939
03:48:06.92 --> 03:48:08.92
but that's more of an ice cream than I'm, I'm favorite.

3940
03:48:08.92 --> 03:48:10.08
Okay.

3941
03:48:10.08 --> 03:48:11.84
So can we have milk ice cream?

3942
03:48:11.84 --> 03:48:12.84
Is that a thing?

3943
03:48:12.84 --> 03:48:17.56
We have things in process for the milk ice cream.

3944
03:48:17.56 --> 03:48:19.24
And did you have some at camp?

3945
03:48:19.24 --> 03:48:20.08
Yes, sir.

3946
03:48:20.08 --> 03:48:22.92
Okay, so yeah, we have milk ice cream.

3947
03:48:22.92 --> 03:48:25.24
We need to move forward on an logistics.

3948
03:48:25.24 --> 03:48:26.24
That's a heavy logistics.

3949
03:48:26.24 --> 03:48:27.92
You know, you're talking about shipping frozen fruits, et cetera.

3950
03:48:27.92 --> 03:48:29.28
So we're moving in that direction.

3951
03:48:29.28 --> 03:48:30.12
We're not there yet.

3952
03:48:30.12 --> 03:48:30.96
We're working on it.

3953
03:48:30.96 --> 03:48:31.80
Gotcha.

3954
03:48:31.80 --> 03:48:34.84
It's, we have milk bars coming, which,

3955
03:48:34.84 --> 03:48:38.28
what's it get totally ridiculous, totally ridiculous.

3956
03:48:38.28 --> 03:48:40.08
I'm changing your stuff.

3957
03:48:40.08 --> 03:48:41.24
So strawberry then.

3958
03:48:41.24 --> 03:48:42.92
Yeah, no, we'll get to the line.

3959
03:48:42.92 --> 03:48:44.12
Yeah, the whole deal of the whole line.

3960
03:48:44.12 --> 03:48:45.08
So you'll just be, you'll be,

3961
03:48:45.08 --> 03:48:46.36
sometimes you're going to be in the woods for men,

3962
03:48:46.36 --> 03:48:47.52
sometimes you're going to be in the woods for, you know,

3963
03:48:47.52 --> 03:48:49.60
strawberry, I've got to say two.

3964
03:48:49.60 --> 03:48:51.56
Oh yeah, those milk bars, you're going to,

3965
03:48:51.56 --> 03:48:52.52
it's funny because, you know,

3966
03:48:52.52 --> 03:48:55.08
how kids are the kind of the litmus test, you know, like,

3967
03:48:55.08 --> 03:48:56.96
if you give the kid like,

3968
03:48:56.96 --> 03:48:58.24
let's say back in the day, right?

3969
03:48:58.24 --> 03:48:59.84
You got your diet, shake.

3970
03:48:59.84 --> 03:49:01.20
And then it's like kids to get out.

3971
03:49:01.20 --> 03:49:02.04
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3972
03:49:02.04 --> 03:49:02.76
And you just give it to the kid,

3973
03:49:02.76 --> 03:49:04.24
the kids like, brought him like this.

3974
03:49:04.24 --> 03:49:06.96
Like, you know, I, I dig it or whatever.

3975
03:49:06.96 --> 03:49:07.88
They don't just don't like.

3976
03:49:07.88 --> 03:49:10.56
So my, and I have a video of this, where my son,

3977
03:49:10.56 --> 03:49:13.08
three, by the way, which is a solid little test group.

3978
03:49:13.08 --> 03:49:13.96
Get a good experiment.

3979
03:49:13.96 --> 03:49:14.96
Yeah, yeah.

3980
03:49:14.96 --> 03:49:16.72
Cause he doesn't have morals or nothing like that.

3981
03:49:16.72 --> 03:49:18.28
So he's just, he'll tell you the truth.

3982
03:49:18.28 --> 03:49:19.12
Yeah, that's what I mean.

3983
03:49:19.12 --> 03:49:20.88
Like he didn't care about your feelings or whatever.

3984
03:49:20.88 --> 03:49:22.76
So yeah, I have a video of him

3985
03:49:22.76 --> 03:49:24.48
champion a moq bar.

3986
03:49:24.48 --> 03:49:25.32
Yeah.

3987
03:49:25.32 --> 03:49:26.64
I didn't give him a moq bar.

3988
03:49:26.64 --> 03:49:28.64
And he's like, oh yeah, he just chucked the chocolate bar,

3989
03:49:28.64 --> 03:49:29.48
whatever.

3990
03:49:29.48 --> 03:49:30.68
And I was like, what are you eating?

3991
03:49:30.68 --> 03:49:32.88
And he's like, yeah, frozen chocolate bar.

3992
03:49:32.88 --> 03:49:36.04
And here's the thing, I put those in the freezer to hide them.

3993
03:49:36.04 --> 03:49:37.24
And he went in there, shake it.

3994
03:49:37.24 --> 03:49:38.08
Shake it down.

3995
03:49:38.08 --> 03:49:41.04
With motivation, obviously, you're seeing same taste buds.

3996
03:49:41.04 --> 03:49:43.48
Is the number one motivating factor in this case.

3997
03:49:43.48 --> 03:49:44.08
Yeah.

3998
03:49:44.08 --> 03:49:45.36
Anyway, so that was the test.

3999
03:49:45.36 --> 03:49:46.08
That's the most bar though.

4000
03:49:46.08 --> 03:49:47.44
I don't want to get too ahead of myself.

4001
03:49:47.44 --> 03:49:48.04
Yeah, yeah.

4002
03:49:48.04 --> 03:49:50.16
We'll stick with the moq for now.

4003
03:49:50.16 --> 03:49:51.08
All right, so yes.

4004
03:49:51.08 --> 03:49:54.84
And by the way, all those things, the supplementation,

4005
03:49:54.84 --> 03:49:58.72
the drinks, everything is available at originmain.com.

4006

So you go to jockelstore.com.

03:51:08.84 --> 03:51:12.84
Or you can just search for Dancranchonic pops up.

4034
03:51:12.84 --> 03:51:15.04
Don't forget about the grounded podcast

4035
03:51:15.04 --> 03:51:18.80
where we talk about the most important things in life.

4036
03:51:18.80 --> 03:51:23.56
All kind of related to another thing in life called jiu-jitsu.

4037
03:51:23.56 --> 03:51:25.28
War your kid podcast.

4038
03:51:25.28 --> 03:51:27.44
We're going to have one of Dancranchonic, by the way.

4039
03:51:27.44 --> 03:51:30.96
So your kids can figure out how they want to be

4040
03:51:30.96 --> 03:51:32.16
directed down the path.

4041
03:51:32.16 --> 03:51:34.24
And don't forget about that War Your Kid soap

4042
03:51:34.24 --> 03:51:38.12
from IrishOach Ranch.com.

4043
03:51:38.12 --> 03:51:43.60
Black soap, which is magically turns to cladliness on your body.

4044
03:51:43.60 --> 03:51:45.08
Yep, counterintuitive for sure.

4045
03:51:45.08 --> 03:51:47.68
It's called, yes, Dan.

4046
03:51:47.68 --> 03:51:48.28
Question.

4047
03:51:48.28 --> 03:51:49.44
I've black toothed, this.

4048
03:51:49.44 --> 03:51:51.44
Okay, well, we're going to activate a charcoal.

4049
03:51:51.44 --> 03:51:52.44
Activated charcoal.

4050
03:51:52.44 --> 03:51:54.64
And it helps some sort of thing, right?

4051
03:51:54.64 --> 03:51:56.44
I don't know what it does.

4052
03:51:56.44 --> 03:51:58.32
Yes, but we know it's kind of looks cool.

4053
03:51:58.32 --> 03:51:59.48
It stains my towels.

4054
03:51:59.48 --> 03:52:00.64
We know that it looks cool.

4055
03:52:00.64 --> 03:52:02.64
So, but it feels cleaner.

4056
03:52:02.64 --> 03:52:03.16
Yeah.

4057
03:52:03.16 --> 03:52:03.80
I like it.

4058
03:52:03.80 --> 03:52:07.96
So we got soap that helps to kill germs bacteria.

4059
03:52:07.96 --> 03:52:09.48
Does not stick to the virus.

4060
03:52:09.48 --> 03:52:10.48
Oh, that.

4061
03:52:10.48 --> 03:52:11.48
Yeah.

4062
03:52:11.48 --> 03:52:15.36
And that soap is called killer soap.

4063
03:52:15.36 --> 03:52:18.24
And what that will do, it will help you and your family

4064
03:52:18.24 --> 03:52:19.24
stay clean.

4065
03:52:19.24 --> 03:52:20.24
Yeah.

4066
03:52:20.24 --> 03:52:23.24
See, that's got a YouTube channel.

4067
03:52:23.24 --> 03:52:24.24

03:52:27.80 --> 03:52:28.80
Good, good looking guy.

4071
03:52:28.80 --> 03:52:29.80
Really good looking.

4072
03:52:29.80 --> 03:52:30.80
You know, cool.

4073
03:52:30.80 --> 03:52:31.80
I patch new.

4074
03:52:31.80 --> 03:52:32.80
I patch by the way.

4075
03:52:32.80 --> 03:52:33.80
It's new.

4076
03:52:33.80 --> 03:52:34.80
Yeah.

4077
03:52:34.80 --> 03:52:35.80
Just unveiled this one.

4078
03:52:35.80 --> 03:52:36.80
Blow him.

4079
03:52:36.80 --> 03:52:37.80
You want to see what that looks like.

4080
03:52:37.80 --> 03:52:39.80
We have a YouTube channel on YouTube.com, et cetera.

4081
03:52:39.80 --> 03:52:40.80
You understand.

4082
03:52:40.80 --> 03:52:41.80
Also some excerpts on there by the way.

4083
03:52:41.80 --> 03:52:45.80
If you don't want to watch the whole thing, if you don't want to forward to your

4084
03:52:45.80 --> 03:52:48.08
friend to go, hey, check out what echo

03:52:49.60 --> 03:52:51.08
And then they send him a four hour.

4087
03:52:51.08 --> 03:52:52.08
What is it?

4088
03:52:52.08 --> 03:52:53.08
Yeah, four hour video.

4089
03:52:53.08 --> 03:52:54.08
Video.

4090
03:52:54.08 --> 03:52:55.08
The whole thing.

4091
03:52:55.08 --> 03:52:56.08
You're part of the problem.

4092
03:52:56.08 --> 03:52:57.08
That part of your life.

4093
03:52:57.08 --> 03:53:03.08
We got psychological warfare on MP3 platforms.

4094
03:53:03.08 --> 03:53:04.88
You're a little psychological here.

4095
03:53:04.88 --> 03:53:05.88
You can get it.

4096
03:53:05.88 --> 03:53:11.52
We got flip side canvas Dakota Meyer, my brother, making cool things to hang on your wall.

4097
03:53:11.52 --> 03:53:12.52
We got a bunch of books.

4098
03:53:12.52 --> 03:53:13.68
We got fortitude by Dan Crenschall.

4099
03:53:13.68 --> 03:53:16.40
We got leadership strategy in tactics, field manual.

4100
03:53:16.40 --> 03:53:18.20
We got the way the warrior kid series.

4101
03:53:18.20 --> 03:53:19.48
We got Mikey in the dragon.

4102
03:53:19.48 --> 03:53:20.48
We got discipline.

4103
03:53:20.48 --> 03:53:21.48
He goes freedom field manual.

4104
03:53:21.48 --> 03:53:23.32
We got extreme ownership of the dichotomy and leadership.

4105
03:53:23.32 --> 03:53:25.96
Get every single one of those books.

4106
03:53:25.96 --> 03:53:28.96
Yeah, get them, yeah.

4107
03:53:28.96 --> 03:53:30.72
Excellent front leadership consultancy.

4108
03:53:30.72 --> 03:53:33.96
What we do is solve problems through leadership.

4109
03:53:33.96 --> 03:53:38.56
Go to echelonfront.com if you need help at your business team corporation.

4110
03:53:38.56 --> 03:53:39.56
We got your covered.

4111
03:53:39.56 --> 03:53:43.60
EF online is online training for leadership interactive.

4112
03:53:43.60 --> 03:53:44.60
Check that out.

4113
03:53:44.60 --> 03:53:48.28
2020 Orlando, May 7th, the eighth.

4114
03:53:48.28 --> 03:53:49.68
So sure about that one.

4115
03:53:49.68 --> 03:53:55.68
We may be getting some, what do you think Dan, what do you think the chances are?

4116
03:53:55.68 --> 03:53:56.68
900 people.

4117
03:53:56.68 --> 03:54:01.76
I mean, experts think, you know, this is a change in America life that will last a month

4118
03:54:01.76 --> 03:54:02.76
or two.

4119
03:54:02.76 --> 03:54:03.92
And then we'll be on the downtrend.

4120
03:54:03.92 --> 03:54:08.76
We can look at the numbers coming out of China and South Korea as perhaps a guide

4121
03:54:08.76 --> 03:54:11.96
as to how the decrease in cases happens.

4122
03:54:11.96 --> 03:54:17.88
Hopefully, we don't even reach the peaks that they did get to be seen.

4123
03:54:17.88 --> 03:54:20.68
Plus we got social distancing slowing down the curve.

4124
03:54:20.68 --> 03:54:21.68
Echoing.

4125
03:54:21.68 --> 03:54:22.68
Echoing.

4126
03:54:22.68 --> 03:54:26.92
Basically, if you hang around echo, echo thinks that he's sort of a national hero right now

4127
03:54:26.92 --> 03:54:29.72
because he's not shaking people's hands.

4128
03:54:29.72 --> 03:54:33.28
He's sort of taken on, you know, you're talking about the typical hero.

4129
03:54:33.28 --> 03:54:34.72
I think we had echo Charles over there.

4130
03:54:34.72 --> 03:54:37.56
He's sacrificing his own hugs.

4131
03:54:37.56 --> 03:54:38.56
His own hugs.

4132
03:54:38.56 --> 03:54:39.56
So I'm not even, yeah.

4133
03:54:39.56 --> 03:54:40.56
It's keeping it real.

4134
03:54:40.56 --> 03:54:43.56
Look, if Orlando doesn't go down, we'll keep you posted.

4135
03:54:43.56 --> 03:54:47.80
But then it's going to be Phoenix Arizona, September 16th and 17th Dallas, Texas, December

4136
03:54:47.80 --> 03:54:49.52
3rd and 4th.

4137
03:54:49.52 --> 03:54:52.56
And of course, we have EF overwatch and EF Legion.

4138
03:54:52.56 --> 03:54:57.76
If you need personnel inside your business that understand the principles that we talk

4139
03:54:57.76 --> 03:55:04.72
about all the time, that we wrote about go to EF overwatch.com for executive leadership

4140
03:55:04.72 --> 03:55:05.72
from the military.

4141
03:55:05.72 --> 03:55:10.000
Go to EF Legion.com for frontline troops and leaders.

4142
03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:11.84
That's what we do.

4143
03:55:11.84 --> 03:55:16.80
And if you still want to interact with us some more, which is just getting kind of crazy.

4144
03:55:16.80 --> 03:55:18.28
I mean, it's been a long time.

4145
03:55:18.28 --> 03:55:19.28
There's a lot of hours.

4146
03:55:19.28 --> 03:55:23.76
But if you need more, then we are on the in-depth.

4147
03:55:23.76 --> 03:55:31.48
Like I said, Dan is on Twitter and on Instagram at Dan Crenshaw, TX for Texas Facebook, Dan

4148
03:55:31.48 --> 03:55:38.92
Crenshaw website, Dan Crenshaw for Congress, echoing out on Twitter on Instagram and

4149
03:55:38.92 --> 03:55:41.24
on good old VT.

4150
03:55:41.24 --> 03:55:42.24
Okay.

4151
03:55:42.24 --> 03:55:44.68
Echoes at Echo Charles and I am at Jocquark.

4152
03:55:44.68 --> 03:55:46.16
Echo, any closing thoughts?

4153
03:55:46.16 --> 03:55:48.92
No, good to see Dan Crenshaw again.

4154
03:55:48.92 --> 03:55:52.96
This time, this time as an esteemed member of the Steeamed Steeamed Steeamed.

4155
03:55:52.96 --> 03:55:53.96
Big time esteemed, yeah.

4156
03:55:53.96 --> 03:55:54.96
It's a lovely word.

4157
03:55:54.96 --> 03:55:56.68
I really appreciate it.

4158
03:55:56.68 --> 03:55:57.68
It's been fun.

4159
03:55:57.68 --> 03:55:58.68
Yeah.

4160
03:55:58.68 --> 03:55:59.96
A little longer than we thought.

4161
03:55:59.96 --> 03:56:00.96
It happened.

4162
03:56:00.96 --> 03:56:01.96
We got a lot to say.

4163
03:56:01.96 --> 03:56:02.96
Man.

4164
03:56:02.96 --> 03:56:04.80
Some tangential things.

4165
03:56:04.80 --> 03:56:05.80
But all good.

4166
03:56:05.80 --> 03:56:09.000
Thanks for coming back on.

4167
03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:10.84
Thanks for sharing your life story and your lessons.

4168
03:56:10.84 --> 03:56:15.16
I'm not just here, but in the book and I know people are going to thank you for the book.

4169
03:56:15.16 --> 03:56:18.28
I am going to thank you and everyone.

4170
03:56:18.28 --> 03:56:22.52
Thanks you for your service and your sacrifice.

4171
03:56:22.52 --> 03:56:26.04
Not only on the battlefield, but now you're fighting a different kind of battle.

4172
03:56:26.04 --> 03:56:27.84
You know, you and I talk offline.

4173
03:56:27.84 --> 03:56:32.80
I told you twice once on the phone and once when you showed up here, I'm really glad that

4174
03:56:32.80 --> 03:56:33.80
you have your job.

4175
03:56:33.80 --> 03:56:34.80
I have mine.

4176
03:56:34.80 --> 03:56:41.48
Your job is not one that I would want and not fun, but you're doing it for the right

4177
03:56:41.48 --> 03:56:42.48
reasons.

4178
03:56:42.48 --> 03:56:47.88
And I think everyone appreciates the fact that you're fighting a battle for the future

4179
03:56:47.88 --> 03:56:48.88
of America.

4180
03:56:48.88 --> 03:56:54.48
So that America remains now and forever.

4181
03:56:54.48 --> 03:56:58.36
The land of the free and the home of the brave.

4182
03:56:58.36 --> 03:57:01.84
And the same goes to the rest of our service men and women out there.

4183
03:57:01.84 --> 03:57:06.76
Film is not free and someone has to hold the line.

4184
03:57:06.76 --> 03:57:12.40
And it is all of you soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines out there who keep evil and

4185
03:57:12.40 --> 03:57:14.16
darkness at bay.

4186
03:57:14.16 --> 03:57:15.16
And we thank you for that.

4187
03:57:15.16 --> 03:57:19.000
And the same thing goes to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics

4188
03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:23.92
and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and board of patrol and secret service.

4189
03:57:23.92 --> 03:57:25.68
Same thing.

4190
03:57:25.68 --> 03:57:27.16
Freedom isn't free.

4191
03:57:27.16 --> 03:57:31.80
It takes sacrifice and thanks to all of you for what you do every day.

4192
03:57:31.80 --> 03:57:37.44
To take care of us and keep our country free and to everyone else out there.

4193
03:57:37.44 --> 03:57:40.84
Life is a struggle.

4194
03:57:40.84 --> 03:57:42.04
It's a challenge.

4195
03:57:42.04 --> 03:57:45.40
It's suffering.

4196
03:57:45.40 --> 03:57:48.32
And you're not always going to win.

4197
03:57:48.32 --> 03:57:51.72
But even when you don't win, as Dan says, don't quit.

4198
03:57:51.72 --> 03:57:52.72
Don't give up.

4199
03:57:52.72 --> 03:57:54.60
Don't be a victim.

4200
03:57:54.60 --> 03:57:56.80
Don't take the easy path.

4201
03:57:56.80 --> 03:57:59.52
Don't squander this life.

4202
03:57:59.52 --> 03:58:05.52
Instead live with fortitude.

4203
03:58:05.52 --> 03:58:11.48
By getting up every day, then getting after it.

4204
03:58:11.48 --> 03:58:34.44
And until next time, this is Dan Crenshaw and Echo and Jocco out.
