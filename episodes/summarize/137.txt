And I'm like this is awesome the two you do it in like in reprisal to me are The the cop you do that but in like revenge like if you get to like all right, sir I'm like content You're in my you're in the wrong neighborhood today. You know The instructors representative are as well self as they're trying to press you so we sign a contract Sign a contract is okay, but if you believe in and the instructor you'd like what you saying you like the environment because then as a visitor You're gonna see like this person not trying to sell me something you can see how they actually are and if you hear what they're saying It's making sense to you and you you vibe with the energy or let's say the style or the personality of the The instructor go to all five gyms in this and pay the day fee 20 30 bucks and try and then come back Which which one did you like best and then try it out and yes Jesus awesome because Also you're not getting hit the head. Yeah, like it's like making my mind like Pro solve problems rather than like be all you know you have little micro reaction the inside internally I mean I'm not bad. I'm not really for some reason Me and Corop don't talk so much anymore but he was the resident Grappling guy slash coach training partner so I arrived and I'm like I'm kind of like the new guy like a This dude that he looks at me and there was that little bit of like okay, this is the new guy. and when this is like a transition I had a Like an energy type drink the other day and because I was driving and I needed a little energy and it was like one of those ones And it said you know like all the all the little buzzwords on it healthy natural blah Charles game and she got ready and about to leave and the guy said hey listen You know I like you like spend time with you, but I'm just saying I Had my own expectations and you know I don't really want to be with a girl who goes out all the time with a girl Friends, I mean how a good time go have a good time. but I was kind of like waxed days ago like always close I went hey echo here's my arm and usually he's like there's something wrong like it's there's a trap Usually there's a trap. and I feel like I'm a like whatever I was like it's like so if you lose I lose also I'm a strong swimmer, I'm not, he was like, you know, like, flipers, you know, I flipers like, I thought he did. You know like Jocco said I mean there's been some rough times and That's some some some unique things that I'd been through and you know That's how you know you have a little bro's real team stick by my side and you know help me actually You know if I can help them as well. and He afterwards he was like, you know, he was cool to watch you roll because First of all, like it didn't even look like Anything I've been training right because you guys are just getting crazy and he goes Okay on it calm flash jockel this is where you can get your kettlebells I got some heat for calling them artistic kettlebell actually wasn't called them that for Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't he it was like an inch or an offering what are Just to get a little like primal bells the ones that look like faces on them But you know I noticed it's a beautiful bro, you know you know in Japan and Russia Brazil whatever Caratia in any country you can imagine I've been to for some reason I'm I'm by far like not a Criminal or something like that but for some reason you get you get a lot of these Gangster mafia type guys that are fans and you end up hanging out these guys and happen to Russia or like an a movie theater like I'm sitting next to you ready I like that range just my style you know No, I roll you were meant for that you were meant for that do you what do you think about when you see All the for locks that's become such a huge focus the game I remember one day you came in everyone cheered for you because it's the first You know you were like you're maybe like when I face she's like my shadow and the superfight and you know like well their foot hit hit Hammer something like that you get on so where you like we get it move That's why I was that's if you're drinking Because I know it like tea if you drink tea, but if it was just if it was just like you in a store in grab the can you open You be like It's not cool and he also do the I'll do it to all start I'll like the fire you know like like and we don't you know, that's just kind of our attitude Here's a quick story jockel you would appreciate it and I'm not gonna say his name because you know Been training here for a few years nice nice guy Actually came through me and said hey Dean I want you know I really like training with you or my coach It's always It's really interesting very Great man I used to just spam his phone up I send like videos and or pictures And one of the funniest things you used to like you didn't do this like yeah, but I really know how like through the day you'll get you know How to get tested things won't go your way or whatever I felt like oh man. He's two by the way and I think he thought it was like a for real milk Like a dessert and he's like yeah, so this may be like a week or two into due to Right even then right when we locked up I knew okay that there is zero chance of me beating Dean Yeah, or that's maybe when Dave Burk came on and we were talking about top gun and how like He he he said it up really nice thing. He was like the next day Yeah, or like in the like yeah, you know military police firefighters border patrol paramedics other first responders We know that all of you makes sacrifices every day to protect us and we Absolutely thank you for that and like Dean I also hope that all you and all those jobs Find some time to train some jujitsu Because it'll make you better at your job, but it'll make you better at life and if you can't find jujitsu Find some boxing or some judo or some resting or some mojitai or Some way to train so that you can fight when the time comes And and really that goes to everyone that is listening to this If you can get out there fight Like I was wondering what's up with that because if you're super competitive in training you'll pull that kind of stuff Like jacquette now Pull not he won't cheat like that, but jacquette is a little more stingy selfish Yeah that guy You know the first time I trained with him at crowcops gym Chrome has a gym under his house is full gym with a case Sasha ways That 230 probably dude he's got a ways in that his head I've knack on the size of this table five foot but it's five foot nine ten, you know and he has real good hands That guy's hardcore he was what's up with his head and his Come on, he was like and I was like what do you mean he's like you normally just look like The same all the time Well, I Okay, I was a seal Whereas maybe a 19 year old kid who wants to be a seal will be like I'm gonna be as you know He's gonna say it and a young fighter or Or someone wants to be a fighter to be like And I was like, and so again, you tell me if this is insecurity, but I was like, I never want to have another man be able to impose his will on me like that. So by the way Stuff to that Mental note I don't know you know these themes I have like I Just finished with All for Venezuela like I yeah, you are my U.S. fighter you get a really established fighter is not Not gonna usually say I'm a fighter I break those arms and not use that way also Some of the richest people I know you wouldn't know the rich because But I've met girls diddy girls who they have one nice dress Their pores hell, but they look they look like their rich when they're going out They're trying really hard to look rich, Three quarters, yeah, it was like, you know, whether maybe at the beach by the house is with, you know, both I don't know, or my own branch, yeah. Yeah, yeah, this one's healing way faster Like night and day way crazy faster anyway joint warfare so supplements Jocco has Thankfully joint warfare glucose to mean conjoining you know grappling we always kind of knew about that Oh, curcumin and then also Jocco super krill oil Which is good for your joints? So I'm like, Joc, how much did you lose you mother, you know, I think I was like three quarters of, I think I think I actually read the stuff. I just, I look like, like, from a damn horror movie, like, with the real one. Sounds like, sounds like something sounds like I'm making them up. It's actually a lot of times when you teach moves you're like this is a move that you would only do to someone that's Very good friend of yours or someone that you hate Yeah, which is really kind of jacked up if you think about it like I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, mental note. And I'm like, I'm just like, I'm like a shame. I think you just you know a higher understanding about that the the Confrontational A few my bees I've talked about how when you blow with someone you've never rolled with before you meet someone And as soon as you make contact with them as soon as you clinch up with them you can tell what's up You can you can kind of tell Like okay, this is gonna be this guy knows what he's doing this because this person doesn't really know Or they're okay or wait a second you right before the match because we were trained for like three weeks You know and a pretty old right before match because he didn't want to talk to you He said in English section he went just so you know I came down here to help you and If you don't win today, I've let you down Yes, I might my dad would kind of like how you raised the war like you know you're gonna do this yeah Go like it's fine because we know what we do here and Other gyms it's like I heard in Russia, and they're doing crowbar with a cage on my hand that's very round, so like, and the man always kind of thinks, you know what, maybe someone's done it before me, but you brought a legit actual military gas mask on the treadmill, like, do you put this on with that? and Yeah, you don't force the war, but you kind of Encouraging did you start things and that's how my dad was that's another little torture that you do with Thor with my son with a I don't know why I go um I don't know why I just go um Eight or what's your favorite food and and he'll go like oh steak. and you can see as you said humility is taught and and the people of Mike to be humbled They're probably not gonna last very long doing a martial art especially jiu-jitsu because It's such a Close and personal like you got owned like that there's no escape our belongs to jockel. I don't know what I'm just It felt like I could manage that like really good It's just some of the odd of first I don't I have no idea why I just say hey and like I just think of themes You know, and then they're like I mean you don't just Bale on people that you've trained with for a long time and there's a level of loyalty and that that's not like some level that you are holding a gun to someone Tadots like man you're been training with someone for a long time you keep training with them and you you have a relationship with them They'd take me like, they said, I didn't know you could armlock somewhere from the guard and I'm like, well, they arms there. So by the time, so I literally went down to Fabio's the next day and signed up and he's like, you want to try a class and I was like, no, I just want to sign up unlimited classes 125 bucks a month here. and Joc was like, you know, next two weeks, you could have like a can of two in a per day We were at this pool, like it's late night, like 130, I don't know, whatever was midnight, maybe. So it's not a protein drink, but it happens to have 22 grams of protein in one's curskoo and taste like like a forever Probiotics or something to has probiotics You know And so we're talking, this is like 90, I don't know, 97, 98 something like that. I don't know why I'm like I'm just somewhere today I was filmed with the I'm like I'm a There's some of the guys from the side I can I can throw them I can do the skate and I could leave That's something you said when you know a lot since if I decide I don't want to fight and you can't Restrain me I can leave yeah, and now days with all the lawsuits and stuff like that I mean just making a fist is ammunition for a lawyer that's that's a sign Okay, matter of fact if he had some of the open palm it's not And many jurisdictions is not the same if you were strange someone if you had to and I yeah, jocquaity in canstue by the way if you like tea in a can or if you just like the whole idea of holding a can oh, you kind of like the fourth time he's like all right, There's something like it's actually a word that I literally created so we were testing to make something and I was like Hey man, this has to taste really good I'm like 99.3 and Yeah, and Kind of be something you're head like what's he doing? and I'm like brother We can make it happen He's ordering jocquaity which is awesome like I said it's awesome because As I said last time jp used to get on those energy No, well, no, okay, so the mean kicknets story is different so it was like When I for the first time I ever rolled with you you were like hey, I come roll You know, you know Well, you know, you can tell a lot about a person by how they fight and also how they handle defeat and how they handle victory That's why I don't do it as an outward display, but every time I win You know someone I never run around yelling I I check on them and if I was lose I shaking my opponent's hand I'm not there's nothing I'm not saying anything I'd more about that, but but that's something I would strive to be is some of this respectful No Right seems like like a psycho thing to do with this Don't do that unless good. Yeah kind of like a royalty like scenario And I was like how how how this is literally what I thought how embarrassing is it kind of be and how awkward is it gonna be if like I get Dean today and it was And even at that point even before this was like when you were in pride This was like right after you won up or maybe right before And so these guys, I mean Salo is like, like he said, five time old. I feel like I'm gonna start stabbing like the road with the battle axe and attacking people I go water that's a good way to support and represent like I said jocco store.com Also good way to support is to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already seems obvious I know Yeah, you're up by like three or four times like go for the videos yeah, this is ways strong Such as like she's like shrek oh Hold right there hold you got this you know like that type of thing strategic one Presence yeah, stick by their Yeah, it's like it's like a protein supplement and a dessert Poo Pete was like are you serious and I was like yeah, Yeah, you think about some because you can't that's the thing, you know you're getting to a point where I can't just allow Some little some little situation to occur because I can go to it's like the The event horizon On a black hole I went to double like I'm like good Hey, 18 year, you're facing a little fear to mom like, yeah, do you know how good that guy is? Yeah, I think I don't think it kind of thing Even though it kind of is broke because you look at me like it's broke everything with time Either way when you're signing up for podcasts don't forget that there's also the one your kid And there's like 200 guys who are just like, good. And as after half hour, I see this girl like eight people down going like, hi, remember me? I'm like and he was like he was very surprised he thought I was gonna be mad or something But so I was thinking like the Machado invitation, which I think you won that like four or five times you were the champion. She's broke if if you got strec and like took away his green skin but like a pill Polar bear white skin on And you say like you were naturally good at Sambos and you were like the national champion. So the other day I hear I'm like in the side not in the next room but kind of like to the side I'm not in her visual
