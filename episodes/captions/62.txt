[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 62 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:08] echo. Good evening. The smallest detail taken from an actual incident in war is more
[00:00:19] instructive for me a soldier than all the fears and jomones in the world. They speak no doubt
[00:00:27] for the heads of states and armies, but they never show me what I wish to know, a battalion,
[00:00:34] a company, a squad in action. Concerning a regiment, a battalion, a company of squad,
[00:00:42] it is interesting to know the disposition taken to meet the enemy or order for the march
[00:00:49] toward them. What becomes of this disposition or this march order under the isolated or combined
[00:00:56] influences of accents of the terrain and the approach of the danger? Is this order changed or
[00:01:04] is it continued in force when approaching the enemy? What becomes of it arriving within the range
[00:01:13] of the guns, within the range of the bullets? At what distance is a voluntary or an order
[00:01:21] disposition taken before starting operations for commencing fire for charging or for both?
[00:01:29] How did the fight start? How about the firing? How did the man adapt themselves?
[00:01:36] How was the charge made? At what distance did the enemy flee before it? At what distance did the
[00:01:44] charge fall back before the fire or the good order and good dissident dispositions of the enemy?
[00:01:50] Or before such and such a movement of the enemy? What did it cost? What can be said about all
[00:02:01] these with reference to the enemy? What about the behavior? I.e. the order, the disordered,
[00:02:11] the shouts, the silence, the confusion, the calmness of the officers and men, whether with us
[00:02:17] or with the enemy before during and after combat? How has the soldier been controlled and directed
[00:02:26] during the action? At what instant has he had a tendency to quit the line in order to remain behind
[00:02:35] or rush ahead? At what moment? If the control were escaping the leader's hands?
[00:02:43] Has it no longer been possible to exercise it? At what instant has this control escape from the
[00:02:52] battalion commander? When from the captain? The section leader or the squad leader? What time?
[00:03:00] In short, if such a thing did take place, was there but a disordered impulse?
[00:03:06] Whether to the front or to the rear, carrying a long, pale male with it, both leaders and men?
[00:03:17] Where and when did the halt take place? Where and when were the leaders able to resume control of the
[00:03:23] men? At what moments before during or after the day was the battalion roll call? The company roll call made?
[00:03:31] The results of these roll calls? What were they? How many dead? How many mooned, wounded on the side?
[00:03:41] And on the other side? The kind of wounds of the officers, non-commissioned officers,
[00:03:46] corpus, privates, etc. All these details in a word and lighten either the material or the
[00:03:54] moral side of the action or enable it to be visualized? Possibly a closer examination might show
[00:04:03] that they are matters infinitely more instructive to us as soldiers than all the discussions imaginable
[00:04:10] on the plans and general conduct of campaigns of the greatest captain in the great movements of the
[00:04:15] battlefield. From kernel to private we are soldiers, not generals, and it is therefore our trade
[00:04:26] that we desire to know. Certainly one cannot obtain all the details of the same incident,
[00:04:35] but from a series of true accounts, there should emanate an ensemble of characteristic
[00:04:41] details which in themselves are very apt to show in a striking irrefutable way what was
[00:04:47] necessarily and forcibly taking place at such in such a moment of an action in war.
[00:04:55] Take the estimate of a soldier obtained in this manner to serve as a base for what might possibly
[00:05:02] be a rational method of fighting. It will put us on guard against a priori or pedantic school
[00:05:12] methods. Whoever has seen turns to a method based on his knowledge, his personal experience as a soldier,
[00:05:24] but experience is long and life is short. The experiences of each cannot therefore be
[00:05:35] completed except by those of others. Proofs have weight. And that right there is an excerpt from a letter
[00:05:54] by a French officer in the French army named Arden Dubique. He was in the French army in the
[00:06:03] mid-1800s which had him then fighting in the Crimean War. 1855, he was in Syria. During the
[00:06:15] sectarian violence of 1860 and 1861, he saw service now, Gerea from 1864 to 1866. And finally,
[00:06:25] he was a regimental commander during the outbreak of the Franco Prussian War where he served as the
[00:06:34] commander for 33 days of his regiment from 15 July 1870 until 18 August 1870 when he was
[00:06:46] severely wounded by Shrapnel and eventually died of those wounds.
[00:06:49] So, there's something that I really like about this guy, Arden Dubique. And that is that he likes
[00:07:01] what I like. He is interested in what I am interested in and that is primarily human nature.
[00:07:10] People and human beings and how they act under stress and under fear and in the face of death
[00:07:22] and then more important, how do you lead in those situations? Then he recognized
[00:07:32] that war while just like today, it certainly involves tactics and strategy and technology
[00:07:42] and politics, but war at its core is about people. Men, human beings. And therefore, the general
[00:07:59] and the captain and the sergeant and the lieutenant in order for them to master war,
[00:08:08] they first have to master their understanding of human nature.
[00:08:16] And that is what he looked at and that is what we will look at tonight and obviously
[00:08:23] when you look at human nature in the context of war, it does not change when you put it in the
[00:08:34] context of life, the rest of life. Now, as we know combat is like life put amplified and intensified.
[00:08:46] So, when you see the emotions and the human nature in war, it's much clearer, it's much easier to see
[00:08:51] than it is off the battlefield in regular life in the business world. But when you know the undercurrents,
[00:09:00] it makes you that much better of a leader. And dupeak, like many other great military leaders,
[00:09:08] especially ones that I've seen to like, use a little bit of a rebel, spoke his mind,
[00:09:16] kind of like, kind of like hackworth, kind of like patent. He called it out when he saw things going
[00:09:23] wrong. He called it out when he saw slack, slack that would lead to poorly trained and therefore,
[00:09:32] poorly prepared troops. So luckily he wrote a lot of his work down. This is a work called
[00:09:43] Battle Studies and unfortunately he didn't finish it because he was killed. But he got a lot
[00:09:49] done and it is a lot of lessons to be learned in here. So with that, let's go ahead and go back to the book.
[00:10:06] Now, this is his critique. Remember I said he was a little bit of a rebel. So this is a talking
[00:10:12] about Frederick the Great on Manuvers. And here's what he said. The Great Mistake and Inspections
[00:10:20] is that you officers amuse yourself with God knows what buffoonries and never dream in the least
[00:10:26] of serious servers. This is a source of stupidity which would become most dangerous in case of
[00:10:32] serious conflict. Take shoemakers and tailors and make generals of them and they will not
[00:10:38] commit worse follies. These blunders are made on a small as well as a large scale.
[00:10:44] Consequently in the Greatest Number of Regiments the Private is not well-trained. In
[00:10:49] Serambus Regiment he is the worst. In Fatans he amounts to nothing and no more in callers,
[00:10:56] ear latch or haggers. Why? Because the officers are lazy and try to get out of a difficulty
[00:11:02] by giving themselves the least possible trouble. Call them out the slack and that was a bunch
[00:11:09] of obviously a bunch of regimental commanders that he's saying these guys are not good at what they're
[00:11:14] doing and they're not jitting after with their guys and getting them trained up and ready to rock
[00:11:20] and roll. So this is where he kind of lays out what I was talking about and his view of war
[00:11:29] being primarily about man. Back to the book. Battle is the objective, battle is the final objective
[00:11:38] of armies and man is the fundamental instrument in battle. Nothing can wisely be prescribed in any
[00:11:46] army. It's personnel, organization, discipline and tactics, things which are connected like the
[00:11:53] fingers of a hand without exact knowledge of the fundamental instrument, man, and his state of mind,
[00:12:02] his morale at the instant of combat. It often happens that those who discuss war taking the weapon
[00:12:10] for the starting point. Assume unhesitatingly that the man called the servant will always use it
[00:12:17] as contemplated and ordered by the regulations. But such a being throwing off his variable
[00:12:24] nature to become an impassive pawn and abstract unit in the combinations of battle is a creature
[00:12:32] born of the musings of the library. So legit. So you say, like, oh, you think these guys are going
[00:12:40] to go out and just do what you tell them to do? That's that's a fantasy that you can only find
[00:12:44] in the library. You won't find it back to the book and not a real man. Man is flesh and blood.
[00:12:52] He is body and soul. And strong as the soul often is, it cannot dominate the body to the point where
[00:12:59] there will be a will that where there will not be a revolt of the flesh and mental
[00:13:05] petribution in the face of destruction. The human heart to quote Marshall Disax is then the
[00:13:16] starting point in all matters pertaining to war. Boom. Think about that. And it's the same thing
[00:13:29] with leadership overall. People. So what you're doing? You create cool technology. You make a great
[00:13:37] product. You want to build a business. You've got to understand people. You got to understand human
[00:13:41] nature. Back to the book. The best masters are those who know man best. The man of today
[00:13:49] and the man of history. Oh, you've got to understand history. This knowledge naturally comes from a
[00:13:56] study of formations and achievements in ancient war. Boom. Look at what's going on in the past.
[00:14:01] That's one of the reasons that I read books in the first place. Because I want to understand what
[00:14:08] happened in the past. Understand though how those human beings reacted to these situations. I want to know
[00:14:13] that. I want to know that. Back to the book. We shall learn to distrust mathematics and material
[00:14:25] dynamics as applied to battle principles. We shall learn to be aware of the illustrations drawn
[00:14:33] from the range and the maneuver field. So the range where you go shoot a gun and no one shoot
[00:14:37] back to you. Right. Oh, we're going to shoot the gun and no one's going to shoot it back.
[00:14:40] Oh, hey, if this guy can shoot 10 rounds a minute and hit his target on the range, that means
[00:14:46] I can take him out on the battlefield and he'll be able to shoot 10 rounds a minute and hit his target
[00:14:49] wrong answer. You don't know that. That's actually wrong. He's going to shoot 100 rounds a minute.
[00:14:53] He's going to miss his target all of them because he's going to be freaking out.
[00:15:00] Back to the book. There. Oh, and the maneuver field is where you go on. You march around.
[00:15:06] And this is training field too. Right. You go out. You march around a training field or you go around
[00:15:11] even when you try, you know, I see some military units, they simulate combat and it's so cheesy.
[00:15:17] It's got to be hard. You got to have chaos in there. Back to the book.
[00:15:21] There. Experiences with the calm settled, unfitied, attentive, obedient soldier with an intelligent
[00:15:30] and tractable man instrument, insured. So that's what that's what you have in the training
[00:15:37] situation. All those things calm settled, unfitied, the 10 of all those things. This is what
[00:15:42] you really get back to the book and not with the nervous, easily swayed, moved, troubled,
[00:15:48] distraint, excited, restless, being not even under self control who is the fighting man
[00:15:55] from general to private. There are strong men exceptions, but they are rare.
[00:16:04] And he mentions that throughout here. Of course, you're going to get guys that are super calm and
[00:16:08] super courageous. He mentions that throughout this. But from general to private,
[00:16:13] get the guy that's not going to be the same on the battlefield as he is in training.
[00:16:20] Let us then study man in battle for it is he who really fights.
[00:16:29] Man does not enter battle to fight, but for victory. He does everything that he can to avoid the
[00:16:36] first and obtain the second. Boom. Now we start kidding a little psychology here. A man
[00:16:43] surprised, leads an instant to collect his thoughts and defend himself. During this instant, he is killed
[00:16:51] if he does not run away. Fighter flight. The surprise to adversary does not defend himself. He tries to
[00:16:58] flee. So there you go. That's why you're one of the tenants of seal combat is surprise.
[00:17:04] Surprise and violence of action. We are going to surprise you because everybody when you get
[00:17:08] surprised, it's you're defending yourself. And in many cases, running away, that's your best action.
[00:17:21] Back to the book, man taxes is ingenuity to be able to kill without running the risk of being killed.
[00:17:27] This is so fundamental. Think about that. Man taxes is ingenuity to be able to kill without
[00:17:32] running the risk of being killed. That's what all modern weapons are for. Can I shoot this guy
[00:17:36] from 500 yards away? Think that's what I want. You know, we make guns now that shoot around corners.
[00:17:41] We drop bombs from the sky. We want to kill without the risk of being killed. Back to the book,
[00:17:47] his bravery is born of his strength and is not absolute. Before a stronger, he flees without shame.
[00:17:57] So, and he puts out this is what's cool about. Dupique is he's done this massive amount of historical
[00:18:05] studies and he cites all these situations. And he's like, you know, when you're in a bad situation
[00:18:10] and you're confusing a stronger enemy, you can just count on the guys are going to run away.
[00:18:15] Guys are not going to send up here. How many times have you seen that in a street fight?
[00:18:19] Right. As soon as the big friend steps in and says, wait a second, you've got to be here with my buddy.
[00:18:24] Oh, no, no, no, no, I got no problem here. Echo Charles, I'm good. I didn't realize there was a big
[00:18:29] yoke to lie in over here getting ready kicked my butt. So, he's saying that bravery is born of strength.
[00:18:38] And everyone's strong. Everyone's brave when you got 12 people with you and you're going to fight
[00:18:43] one guy. Everyone's brave. When you reverse those roles, doesn't always turn out that way.
[00:18:48] Back to the book, collective man, a disciplined body of troops formed in tactical battle order
[00:18:59] is invincible against an undisciplined body of troops. Boom. But against a similar,
[00:19:06] similar to a disciplined body, he becomes again primitive man. He flees before a greater force
[00:19:14] of destruction when he recognizes it or when he foresees it. Nothing is changed in the heart of man,
[00:19:21] disciplined keeps enemies face to face a little longer. But it cannot supplant the instinct of
[00:19:28] self preservation and the sense of fear that goes with it. Fear. There are officers and soldiers who
[00:19:37] do not know it, but they are people of rare grit. The mass shutters, because you cannot suppress
[00:19:45] the flesh. This trembling must be taken into account in all organizations, discipline,
[00:19:52] arrangements, movements, maneuvers, mode of action. All of these are affected by the human weakness
[00:19:58] of the soldier which causes him to magnify the strength of the enemy. This faltering is studied
[00:20:05] in ancient combat. It is seen that of nations, act in war. The strongest have been those who not only
[00:20:14] best have understood the general conduct of war, but who have taken human weakness into greatest
[00:20:23] account and then taken the best guarantees against it. Powerful. Now what's really interesting
[00:20:33] is when you start when you think about some of these true combat stories, this guy is around in
[00:20:40] the 1860s. The stories that we've talked about on this podcast, what makes them so phenomenal
[00:20:46] is that you can see US Army soldiers, US Marines just completely defying what he's saying here.
[00:20:56] That's a bigger stronger force. We're surrounded by Chinese Army at the chosen reservoir.
[00:21:03] Cool. We're going to fight them. Are we going to run away? No. We're going to go.
[00:21:08] And we're going to stand. So that makes these modern warfare situations even more impressive
[00:21:16] because you realize that the general, as he says, the mass shutters, the mass shutters, so most people
[00:21:24] they shudder with fear and it breaks them down. And even for me and I've talked about this,
[00:21:32] you know, like people always want to ask about sea old training. And it's okay, you're
[00:21:41] cold in your wet and you've got to do a bunch of push ups. You can't sleep that much. Oh, and you can't sleep
[00:21:45] a bunch. But they're also feeding you a bunch and it's fun, right? Sure. But you compare that to
[00:21:53] you know, that stuff doesn't even, it's not, it's nothing. And my favorite example to compare that to
[00:22:02] is you know a guy when we were in Ramadi, you got the guy that's the lead turret gunner going out
[00:22:08] and up a troll in a Humvee. So he's up above the Humvee exposed the enemy and that guy
[00:22:14] went on the way out the gate in Ramadi. You drive by this vehicle graveyard where there was
[00:22:19] 100 vehicles that were blown up and destroyed by ID's. And ID's going to hit the first vehicle. I mean,
[00:22:24] most of them go off and, right? So there's that guy. He's going to be up there and we're, and I'm watching
[00:22:30] this guy go out on Operation after Operation. I marked Lee as primary turret gunner on many
[00:22:35] operations. That's why I remember it really clearly. But same thing, like there's no way that those
[00:22:44] guys and that's one. Of course you got every guy in the vehicle to get out the army guys that are
[00:22:47] out for the Marines. These are guys that I've seen. All of them. Looking at this situation,
[00:22:53] knowing that death is a high possibility. I won't call the probability. That's a high possibility.
[00:22:58] But you know what? Roger that. Yeah. It's rocking wrong. You know when you say,
[00:23:05] bud's training is easy. Do you think? I mean, obviously that's some effect. But you know how you go through
[00:23:11] bud's training and that's kind of the thing. Like, they got through bud's training that, you know,
[00:23:17] I'm tough kind of thing. And then after you go to combat, do you look back on bud's training
[00:23:22] and that's what's making it seem like it's easy? I just thought it was fun for me. Yeah. I
[00:23:29] into the funny thing is it's not like bud's, I mean, I was not a great athlete. So it was hard
[00:23:35] for me to pass the time to have illusions. And I failed some time to have illusions. And they have
[00:23:41] a special way of making people fail things. I mean, yeah, yeah. At the time we do four
[00:23:45] mile time runs that were five mile time runs. But we didn't know that. We just had to run as hard as we
[00:23:49] could. And you know, we had swims that there's a like, you know, a strong ocean current going the
[00:23:55] opposite direction. You know, everyone in the class would fail. Like, I failed to swim like that.
[00:24:00] Everyone in the class failed except for two swim pairs. The two guys that swam and college,
[00:24:05] whatever, those four guys passed everyone else failed. Right. So yeah, I failed that. So I'm not
[00:24:11] saying buds was easy. Although there are guys that are great athletes and they have an easy time with
[00:24:16] the physical part too. And then there's guys that have an easy time with the mental part,
[00:24:21] which is probably where I fell into because I was having a good time. Yeah. And yeah, you know,
[00:24:28] but I think, yes, I think once I think once you get to combat, because there's, you know,
[00:24:32] there's times where guys that obviously are seals made it through buds, they don't want to be
[00:24:36] in combat. No, there's that happens. Yeah, because in combat, just to begin with, never mind,
[00:24:43] firefight's never just just starting off your mindset is I could die today. Yeah, I was just
[00:24:49] starting off regardless of what happens or doesn't happen. I could die today in buds. You would
[00:24:53] think even though buds guys died, but yeah, but very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
[00:24:57] what I mean, so it's like chances are I'm not going to die today. Yeah. You know, very slim, very few
[00:25:03] people usually when people die in buds, they have some kind of a pre-existing condition,
[00:25:08] with they have some kind of a heart trouble that didn't get picked up and they have some kind of
[00:25:10] brain trouble and all of a sudden the pressure of water or whatever they, they unfortunately get
[00:25:16] killed in these horrible situations. But it's a very rare. Right. Very, very, very, very, very,
[00:25:20] especially you compare it to a combat situation. Yeah. Right when you get off the what the plane,
[00:25:25] yeah, you're like, okay, you know, that and that's just starting out. Just that's like a 100%
[00:25:33] chance that that's on your mind. Yeah. That whole time. Yeah. I mean, it's a factor, you know what I mean?
[00:25:37] It is definitely a factor. So yeah, what I'm adding thinking back. Oh, yeah, but not that hard.
[00:25:42] Yeah, I remember thinking about this, the guys that came in relieved us in Ramadi,
[00:25:46] select the next task you that came over who were a bunch of great guys and it been a long time since
[00:25:55] seals had been in sustained urban combat like that and suffered pretty significant casualties.
[00:26:01] Like we did into you, Bruser and those guys, I was friends with good friends with a number of the
[00:26:06] guys in there and and so we're late and the other, you know, all the guys we had friends that were back,
[00:26:12] you know, back in the in that task and that was coming to relieve us and it's taking what you're
[00:26:18] saying and multiplying it times a lot because when we went to Ramadi, we weren't really sure, you know,
[00:26:25] oh, yeah, there's a lot of bad guys there and we'll get after it, but it's different when you get there
[00:26:32] and then you start going on operations and you realize, yeah, this is this is this is going to be
[00:26:36] a long deployment and the chances of us making it through this deployment without suffering
[00:26:42] any casualties is actually zero. It's zero. Like this is not going to happen. And when those
[00:26:48] guys came over again, a bunch of great dudes, you know, I talked to him when we got home and then they got home
[00:26:57] and one of the guys a good friend of mine and he came and worked with me in the training department
[00:27:02] and you know, we would have that conversation a couple times where, you know, Mikey Montsore got
[00:27:08] killed, you know, September 29th and those guys were now coming on deployment a week, maybe two weeks
[00:27:15] later to come over and start getting a turnover from us. We went home October 21st. So, you know,
[00:27:21] when I talked to my buddy that was the senior listed guy, you know, he, he, I said, man, what was
[00:27:26] that like? And he goes, we were training so hard. You know, there's no, they were just a hundred
[00:27:33] a thousand percent training because we'd send him back, hey, make sure you're in good shape,
[00:27:37] make sure you can run, make sure you can do body carries, make sure you, because they're
[00:27:40] running on the beach, you can do a buddy carries all the time. They were training so hard because
[00:27:44] they're thinking of themselves, you know, this is it. This is going to be a different kind of
[00:27:48] deployment. And we're actually going to probably have one of those guys from that follow-in
[00:27:53] deployment on the podcast, who's a stud. So, we'll get him on here in the near future.
[00:28:02] All right. Going back to the book, the discipline of the Greeks was secured by exercises and
[00:28:09] rewards. The discipline of the Romans was secured also by the fear of death. They put to death
[00:28:16] with the club. They decimated their cowardly or traitorous units. They clubbed them to death, clubbed
[00:28:22] them to death. In order to conquer enemies that terrified his men, a Roman general heightened their
[00:28:30] morale, not by enthusiasm, but by anger. He made the life of his soldiers miserable by excessive
[00:28:39] work and privations. He stretched the force of discipline to the point where at a critical incident,
[00:28:46] instant, it must break or expend itself on the enemy. That's that's that's crazy. And it's actually
[00:28:56] there's a great little clip on YouTube of a Marine. I think it's I think it's a sergeant major in
[00:29:02] Rekorbe. He's given a little talk to his boys before they roll out. And he's just he's awesome.
[00:29:07] And he's saying, why do you think we don't feed you good? We want you to be pissed off. We want you to be
[00:29:11] pissed off. You got there kicked their ass. That's what they're this is saying. Only, you know, the
[00:29:15] Marine is being somewhat facetious and playful about it. This guy's not. They made life hard for these
[00:29:22] guys. And again, you can see that even that's it. There's a line. There's a dichotomy like you could
[00:29:26] go too far. Now you're going to get some kind of rebellion. You get it where it's either going to break
[00:29:30] the guys or if you do it perfect, they'll take that rage and they'll use it against the enemy.
[00:29:35] Yeah, kind of like they do with dogs. Yeah, like if you have seen fighting dogs, yeah, for sure. They do that.
[00:29:44] Back to the book, but discipline alone does not constitute superior tactics.
[00:29:49] Men in battle, I repeat, is a being in whom the instinct of self preservation dominates, even at
[00:29:57] certain moments, all other sentiments. Discipline has for its aim, the domination of that instinct
[00:30:05] to buy a greater terror. Okay, so you got, you're going to be scared. Discipline, the goal of discipline
[00:30:12] is to shut down and dominate that fear instinct. Back to the book, but it cannot dominate it completely.
[00:30:20] I do not deny the glorious examples where discipline and devotion have elevated man above himself.
[00:30:27] But if these examples are glorious, it is because they are rare. If they are admired, it is because
[00:30:37] they are considered exceptions and the exception proves the rule. So obviously, we have heroes.
[00:30:43] I have guys, I my tasked it, were that level of heroes that overcame every instinct of self discipline
[00:30:53] or of self preservation to do their job. Back to the book, the determination of that
[00:31:02] instinct, where man loses his reasoning power and becomes instinctive is the crowning achievement
[00:31:10] in the science of combat. So what he's saying, there is understanding that what that where that
[00:31:15] line is with people is the crowning achievement. If you know that, if you know where that line is,
[00:31:20] that's the crowning achievement. In the back of the book, in general, here was the strength of the
[00:31:25] Roman tactics. In particular cases, such successful determination makes handables and
[00:31:32] seizures. They understood their men. Combat took place between masses in more or less
[00:31:41] formate deep formation, commanded and supervised by leaders with a definite mission.
[00:31:47] Leaders understood the mission. The combat between masses was a series of individual
[00:31:52] conflicts juxtaposed with the front rank man fighting a love. If he fell, if he was wounded or
[00:32:00] worn out, he was replaced by the man in the second rank who had watched and guarded his flanks.
[00:32:07] This procedure continued up to the last rank. Man is always physically and morally
[00:32:13] fatigued in hand to hand tournament where he employees all of his energy. These contests lasted
[00:32:19] but a short time. With morale, with like morale, the least fatigued always win. So
[00:32:28] conditioning, literally we're talking about combat conditioning right there. That's what we're talking
[00:32:32] about. During this engagement of the first two ranks, the one fighting the other watching
[00:32:38] close at hand, the men of the near ranks waited inactive at two paces distance for their
[00:32:45] turning combat. So imagine this echo, I'm in the front and you're behind me, two paces,
[00:32:50] and you're gonna watch me fight. So that's what he's talking about right here.
[00:32:59] At two paces for their turning combat, which would come only when their predecessor were killed,
[00:33:05] wounded or exhausted, they were impressed by the violent fluctuations of the struggle of the first rank.
[00:33:13] They heard the clashes and the blows and distinguished perhaps those that sank into the flesh.
[00:33:20] They saw the wounded, the exhausted crawl through the intervals to go to the rear.
[00:33:26] Passive spectators of danger, they were forced to await its terrible approach.
[00:33:32] These men were subjected to the poignant emotions of combat without being supported by the
[00:33:38] animation of the struggle. They were thus placed under moral pressure of the greatest of anxieties.
[00:33:47] Often they could not stand it until their turn came. They gave way. So that's just a crazy way to
[00:33:54] think about combat. You're standing behind me, I'm fighting, I get clubbed in the head, they stabbed
[00:33:59] me in the chest, I'm dead. And actually, that didn't happen fast, let's say it took two minutes.
[00:34:05] You're standing there watching me, you're like, oh, go, hey, and then also get killed.
[00:34:09] Then I'm up. And then you're up. Yeah, that's when he says like the most anxiety.
[00:34:15] Yeah, the most imagine you're four guys back. Well, yeah, you're four guys back. And I can totally
[00:34:22] confirm this in combat. The time when you're waiting to go is the worst. Like we get to a
[00:34:29] pre staging point and now you're waiting to go, okay, you've got all the stuff going through your
[00:34:33] mind, what if this happens, what if this happens, what if this guys moves, what if they do this,
[00:34:36] you've got all this turmoil going in your mind. And you're not even, they're not talking about
[00:34:39] this situation where you're watching your guy get stabbed in the throat, right? And just standing there
[00:34:45] watching it waiting for him to go down so you can step up and by the way, you know, like you know
[00:34:50] me. And so if you see me get crushed and but when we train, I'm crushing you. You know, you're
[00:34:55] laughing. Yeah, right? Because you know, a jocco, he's good with the sword. Oh, he's got stabbed
[00:35:01] neck. Now I got to take his place against Billy Badass, my enemy. And I don't say the chance.
[00:35:07] Yeah, that's right. So that's why you say it a lot of these, a lot of times these people turned
[00:35:10] and gave way. So this is a little bit different. Listen to this. Back to the book,
[00:35:15] the best tactics were those that made easiest a succession of efforts by assuring the relief
[00:35:22] by ranks of unit in action, actually engaging only the necessary units and keeping the rest as
[00:35:29] support or reserve outside of the immediate sphere of moral tension. So don't put those guys right there
[00:35:37] where they can see all the stuff going on. Back to the book, the superiority of the Romans lay in
[00:35:42] such tactics and in the terrible discipline which prepared and assured the execution by their resistance
[00:35:48] against fatigue, which rude and continually continual tasks gave them and by the renewal of
[00:35:55] combatants in combat, they secured continuity of effort greater than anyone else. So did you notice
[00:36:01] this part, their resistance against fatigue came from rude and continual tasks. So these guys
[00:36:06] were just getting ground all the time. Basically they lived a hard life working or basic work and
[00:36:13] out. I'm sure it was wouldn't be what we consider like a Metcon, but they were hard. And because
[00:36:19] they were tough and they were hard, they're physically stronger and more physically conditioned.
[00:36:24] They did better. And you know, Dan Gable, I think I forget the exact quote, but you know,
[00:36:30] the great American wrestler, Dan Gable, conditioning is the ultimate equalizer. If you get time,
[00:36:36] you feel listen to you all the time. You someone gets tired or MMA, someone gets tired. It's game over.
[00:36:40] It's game over. You can, I can crush anybody when they're tired. You give me, you give me
[00:36:47] anybody and you force them to do 100 burpees and 75 kettlebell swings and you know, as fast as they can
[00:36:54] and let me in the ring with them. I'll get anybody. Because they already got worn out. So
[00:37:03] this is actually, this is, like I said, he does a lot of, I didn't go into a lot of these,
[00:37:14] but this is Caesar's account of a battle against the Pompeians and at the battle of
[00:37:26] Farsalas. So I'm not going to read the whole thing, but it's pretty, there's some pretty cool points in here.
[00:37:32] Again, it's pretty cool that, you know, I like first person accounts of things, right? Let's get
[00:37:38] a first person account from Caesar up in here. And what's cool, well, he writes, he refers to himself
[00:37:44] in the third person for whatever reason. I'm sure there's some reason for that, but that's what he does.
[00:37:49] Here we go. Caesar, in the meanwhile, our soldiers at the given signal advanced with
[00:37:54] javelins in hand, but having noticed that that Pompey's soldiers were not running towards them
[00:38:02] and taught by experience and trained by previous battles, they slowed down and stopped in the midst of
[00:38:08] the run in order not to arrive out of breath and worn out. That's pretty legit. They're like,
[00:38:14] these guys aren't running towards us. We don't need to run towards them. Save our breath.
[00:38:19] Some moments after having taken up their run again, they launched their javelins and immediately
[00:38:23] afterwards, according to Caesar's order, drew their swords. The Pompeyans conducted themselves
[00:38:29] perfectly little compliments to the enemy. They received the darts courageously, they did not
[00:38:33] stir before the dash of the legions, they preserved their lines and having dispatched their javelins
[00:38:39] drew their swords. At the same time, Pompey's entire cavalry dashed from the left wing as had been
[00:38:46] ordered and the mass of his archers ran from all parts of the line. Our cavalry did not await
[00:38:52] the charge, but fell back a little. Pompey's cavalry became more pressing and commenced to reform
[00:38:58] its quadrants and turn our exposed flank. As soon as Caesar saw this intention, he gave the
[00:39:06] signal to the fourth line of six cohorts. This line started directly and standards low. They charged
[00:39:13] the Pompey and cavalry with such vigor and resolution that not a single man stood his ground.
[00:39:20] All wheeled about this would happen when you flank people. All wheeled about and not only with
[00:39:26] Jew and full flight, but gained the highest mountains as fast as they could. They left the
[00:39:32] archers and slingers without their defense and protection. These were all killed. At the same time,
[00:39:40] the cohorts moved to the rear of Pompey's left wing, which was still fighting and resisting and
[00:39:45] attacked it in rear. Meanwhile, Caesar had advanced his third line, which up to this moment had
[00:39:53] been quietly kept quietly at its post. These fresh troops relieved those that were fatigued.
[00:39:59] Pompey's men taken in rear could no longer hold out and all took to flight.
[00:40:06] Caesar was not in error when he put these cohorts in a fourth line, particularly charged with
[00:40:10] meeting the cavalry and urged them to do well since their effort would bring victory. They
[00:40:16] repulse the cavalry. They cut to pieces the slingers and arches. They turned Pompey's left wing
[00:40:22] and this decided the day. Caesar lost in this battle 200 soldiers, but nearly 30 of the brave
[00:40:31] centurions were killed therein. Of Pompey's army of 15,000 perished, and more than 24,000 took refuge
[00:40:40] in the mountains as Caesar had invested in the mountains with entrenchment. They surrendered the
[00:40:47] following day. That's one of the things that DuPique points out. He does a lot of comparisons and we'll
[00:40:54] get to some of them in the differences between ancient combat and modern combat and one of the big
[00:40:59] things that he points out is in ancient combat. The winner would take very, very small amounts of
[00:41:07] casualties and the loser would be exterminated in many cases. And what's different about modern
[00:41:14] battle, world war two, world war one, the victor and the loser. They're both going to take
[00:41:23] really bad casualties. In fact, sometimes they take almost the same amount of casualties. In fact,
[00:41:28] sometimes the loser of the battle takes less casualties or takes more casualties. The winner
[00:41:34] takes more casualties, but they had more people. They had better maneuverability. They dropped
[00:41:39] bombs or whatever. So that's a really different thing. And that gets into the mental state because
[00:41:47] think about if you, if you and I were fighting in a battle. Sure. And we knew that if we lost,
[00:41:53] we would die. You're going to fight harder. You're going to be more aggressive. And when and
[00:42:01] if the battle started to turn, you were going to run to try and save yourself.
[00:42:06] Whereas in modern warfare, we take prisoners, you can survive and you can live the fight another
[00:42:12] day. So you know what, hey, we're starting, I'm just going to surrender, but give up on the, you know,
[00:42:16] you're not going to fight with that same kind of bigger.
[00:42:18] Now, there's a comment in here. The order to await the charge given by Pompeii to his infantry
[00:42:28] was judged to severely by Caesar. Caesar certainly was right as a general rule. The enthusiasm of the
[00:42:35] troops must not be dampened. And the initiative of the attack indeed gives to the assailant
[00:42:41] a certain moral influence. So clearly, if your boys, your team is aggressively getting after it,
[00:42:52] it's not a good idea to pull the reins on them. They got the momentum. They're going,
[00:42:56] they're fired up, let them go, let them rock and roll. Obviously, you don't want to let them run to your
[00:42:59] death, but you want to maintain that momentum to the best of your ability.
[00:43:04] Mm.
[00:43:11] Now talking a little bit about morale in ancient battle. This is some of the stuff again that I,
[00:43:16] I, I've been saying back to the book. It was customary among good troops to have a clash,
[00:43:22] but not the blind and headlong onset of the mass. The preoccupation of the rank was very great.
[00:43:29] As the behavior of Caesar troops at Farla, Farcales shows in their slow march. At the moment
[00:43:36] of getting close to the enemy, the dash slacking to of its own accord, because the men of the
[00:43:41] first rank of necessity and instinctively assured themselves of the position of their supports,
[00:43:47] their neighbors in the same line, their comrades in the second, and collected themselves together
[00:43:52] in order to be more the masters of their movement and strike and strike and parry. So that,
[00:43:58] that's not an order that was given. Those guys instinctively, they're getting close to the enemy,
[00:44:02] they slow down, they check their flanks, they check that they're good to go, they check that their
[00:44:05] buddies are behind them, now we're going to go forward, because, and I think that's important because
[00:44:09] it says, in order to be more masters of their movements, they're slowing down so they're ready.
[00:44:15] Back to the book, there was a contact of man with man. Each took the adversary in front of him and
[00:44:22] attacked him because by penetrating into the ranks before having struck him down, he risked being wounded
[00:44:28] in the side by losing his flanks' support. So these guys tried to stay in ranks, because even if
[00:44:34] even if I'm going against you and I chop you down, if I now step into your ranks, now I'm exposed.
[00:44:39] My flanks were exposed, so I can't do that. We got to stay online. This is something we still
[00:44:43] do in the military today. We got to stay online. Each one then hit his man with his shield,
[00:44:49] expecting to make him lose his equilibrium and at the end, and at the instant he tried to recover
[00:44:55] himself landed the blow. The men in the second line, back of the intervals necessary for fencing
[00:45:03] in the first were ready to protect their sides against anyone that advanced between them and were
[00:45:08] prepared to relieve tired warriors. There's the same in the third line, so that's what we already
[00:45:13] talked about. By the way, this is a cover and move. This is ancient cover and move. If I need some help,
[00:45:18] you're going to be right there to cover for me. If I'm fighting guy in front of me, you're
[00:45:22] covering my flanks. That's where it is. It's ancient cover and move. Back to the book. Everyone being
[00:45:27] supported on the other side. The first encounter was rarely decisive and defencing the real combat
[00:45:33] at close quarters began. So after that initial, now is when we get, now is where it gets gritty.
[00:45:40] If the men of the first line were wounded quickly, if the other ranks were not in a hurry to
[00:45:45] relieve or replace them, or if there was hesitation, defeat followed. This happened to the Romans
[00:45:51] in their first encounter with the Gauls. The Gaul, with his shield, parried the first thrust,
[00:45:57] brought his big iron sword swooping down with fury upon the top of the Roman shield, split it
[00:46:04] and went after the man. So the Gauls had some big swords, big guys, and they figured out a little
[00:46:13] tactic technique in procedure. Oh, you got that little round shield. Cool. I'm going to hack it right
[00:46:18] in half and that's what they did. The Romans already hesitating before the more impulse of the Gauls
[00:46:25] the Gauls, their ferocious yells. So this is the Gauls, their ferocious yells, their newdness
[00:46:30] and indication of a contempt for wounds. So the guy that you're fighting is naked or like not wearing
[00:46:38] armor, which says, oh, I'm ready to bring it. The you want to beat me in a street fight, be naked.
[00:46:45] I'm not going to fight you. I'm not not not happening. Fell then in greater number than their
[00:46:51] adversaries and do demoralization followed. Soon, they accustomed themselves to this
[00:46:58] valorous but not tenacious spirit of their enemies. And this is pretty cool. Back to book when they
[00:47:04] had protected the tops of their shields with an iron band. They no longer fell and the rolls were
[00:47:10] changed so they made a little adaptation. Oh, you're going to hack the top of our shields cool
[00:47:14] of an iron band in there. What he got now, Gaul. Bring it. If the weapons were nearly alike
[00:47:26] preserving ranks and thereby breaking down, driving back and confusing the ranks the enemy
[00:47:30] was to conquer. The man in disordered broken lines no longer felt himself supported but vulnerable
[00:47:39] everywhere and he fled. Think about that psychology. So as you start seeing the blinds breaking
[00:47:46] down, you don't feel like you're getting supported anymore, boom, I'm out. It is true that it's
[00:47:51] hardly possible to break hostile lines without doing the same with one's own. But the one who
[00:47:57] breaks through first has been able to do so only by making the foe fall back before his blows
[00:48:03] or by killing or wounding. He is thereby raised his courage and that of his neighbor.
[00:48:11] Common sense. If I see my buddy take that guy out, I'm getting more fired up. He knows
[00:48:18] he sees where he is marching whilst the adversary overtaken as a consequent of the retreat or the
[00:48:23] fall of troops that were flanking him, he's surprised. This is just Giz just group mentality,
[00:48:29] gang mentality. Is that right group thought? Group think. I start seeing my guys get crushed. I'll
[00:48:34] be to get scared. He sees himself exposed on the flank. He falls back on a line with their rank
[00:48:41] in the rear in order to regain support. But the lines in the rear give way to retreat to the
[00:48:47] retreat of the first. If the withdrawal has a certain duration, terror comes as a result of the
[00:48:53] blows which drive back and mowed down the first line. If to make room for those pushed back,
[00:49:00] the last lines turn their backs. There's small chance that they will face the front again.
[00:49:06] Space has tempted them. They will not return to fight. Then by that natural instinct of the soldier
[00:49:14] to worry to assure himself of his supports, the contagion of flight spreads from the last ranks
[00:49:20] to the first. The first closely engaged has been held to the fight in the meantime under the pain
[00:49:26] of immediate death. There is no need to explain what follows. It is butchery.
[00:49:39] You can see how important it would be to understand those dynamics of what's going to happen
[00:49:45] into a ply your tactics and a manner that as they said in the as Dupique says in the beginning,
[00:49:51] you look apply your tactics or formulate your tactics with that understanding of human nature.
[00:49:59] Little interesting note here. Sword Dessord combat was the most deadly. They presented the most
[00:50:04] sudden changes because it was the one in which the individual valor and dexterity of the combat
[00:50:10] had the greatest and most immediate influence. That sword fighting is what takes the most skill.
[00:50:19] So I assume that means if I've got a javelin or if I've got a spear it takes less skill. You get
[00:50:24] man on man with the sword. That's where things count. That's where your skill level counts the most.
[00:50:29] You can maneuver more with it. I'll be clubbed. I hope I can land it. We know from doing
[00:50:37] geetsu that you can get really good. And if you go anybody that does geetsu goes against someone
[00:50:42] that doesn't do geetsu, they annihilate him. So imagine the training that you do with the sword when you
[00:50:48] knew that how much it was going on and just healing guys. Back to the book. Man always has had
[00:50:58] the greatest fear of being trampled upon by horses. This is a section talking about cavalry.
[00:51:04] That fear has certainly routed a hundred thousand times more men than the real encounter.
[00:51:11] So the reason I put that in there is because the geetsu saying hey people are scared of horses.
[00:51:15] They're scared of getting trampled by horses. And that fear of horses has done more to win battles
[00:51:19] than to the actual horses. You know we did some, you know for us the US military,
[00:51:28] we're going against a gnarly enemy. We can put the fear into them too. We have closer support
[00:51:33] coming in and start dropping bombs or even flying over. We did, we would have, you know if we didn't
[00:51:39] have a specific target but we knew bad guys were around. We would shoot like fields. Start dropping
[00:51:45] bombs and fields. If like deterrent fires. Hey get these guys. Hey put us in deterrent. There's a
[00:51:52] field over here. Yes we got no friendly in that area. Do you see anything? No drop some bombs in there.
[00:51:57] Send some shock waves on these bad guys. Same thing. You're scared of the horses. You're scared
[00:52:03] of a AC 130 or an A10 coming down and getting after it or a cobra gunship or an Apache. Yeah those
[00:52:15] things are fearsome machines of death. And when the enemy knows those things are around they're
[00:52:20] going to run. They're going to hide. Can't always run or hide from a person from a Apache or a US gunship.
[00:52:27] All right back to the book. If we have spoken especially of the infantry fight is because
[00:52:33] it was the most serious on foot, on horseback, on the bridge of a vessel at the moment of
[00:52:39] dayager, the same man has always found. So he's saying like we're talking about infantry and we just
[00:52:43] talked a little bit about horses but it doesn't matter what the fighting situation is. The same
[00:52:48] man has always found. Anyone who knows him well reduces from his action in the past what his action
[00:52:55] will be in the future. So understand that human nature. And here we start talking about again it's
[00:53:11] this same theme. Back to the book. Let us repeat now what we've said at the very beginning of this
[00:53:17] study. Man does not enter battle to fight but for victory. He does everything he can to avoid
[00:53:23] the first and obtain the second. The continued improvement of all appliances of war has no other
[00:53:29] goal than the annihilation of the enemy. Absolute bravery which does not refuse battle even on
[00:53:36] unequal terms trusting only to God or destiny is not natural in man. It is the result of moral
[00:53:45] culture. So that's that's pretty that's pretty poignant, right? Because I've seen some absolute
[00:53:51] bravery and there's thousands of individual stories of absolute bravery in our culture, in our
[00:53:59] US culture and that's because of our moral culture that's where it comes from. Back to the book
[00:54:06] it is infinitely rare because in the face of danger the animal case of self preservation always gains
[00:54:12] the upper hand. Man has a horror of death. In the bravest a great sense of duty which they alone are
[00:54:21] capable of understanding and living up to is paramount. But the mass always cowers at the site of the
[00:54:28] phantom death. Discipline is for the purpose of dominating that horror by still greater horror, that of punishment,
[00:54:40] or disgrace. So he's talking about you know what and Tony said this and this is a common
[00:54:50] team guy thing to say you know I would rather die than look like a pussy and it's like oh yeah
[00:54:56] ha ha no actually it's true that's that's an actual feeling it's an actual thought for sure
[00:55:05] and that's what he's saying people would rather die than be disgraced and that's powerful
[00:55:10] but there always comes an instant when natural horror gets the upper hand over discipline and the
[00:55:16] fighter flees. Stop stop hold out a few minutes and instant more and you are the victor you are not
[00:55:22] even wounded if you turn your back you are dead. He does not hear he cannot hear anymore he is full of fear.
[00:55:31] How many armies have sworn to conquer or perish? How many have kept their oaths?
[00:55:38] An oath of sheep to stand up against wolves. History shows not armies but firm souls who have
[00:55:48] fought unto death and the devotion of thermopoli is therefore justly immortal so the Spartans
[00:55:57] the 300 Spartans there's a reason why that is any immortal story because it's rare and it's not a
[00:56:04] whole army it's 300 Spartans and obviously we've seen examples of guys doing the same kind of thing
[00:56:12] but that's why they're heroes. To ensure success in the rude test of conflict it is not
[00:56:23] sufficient to have a mass composed of valiant men the mass needs and we give it leaders who have
[00:56:32] firmness and decision of command proceeding from habit and an entire faith in their unquestimal
[00:56:37] right to command as established by tradition law and society. So step number one you need good leadership
[00:56:44] step number one you need good leadership. Bunch of valiant men is not going to be enough you need
[00:56:49] good leadership step number one. Step number two we add good arms we add methods of fighting
[00:56:56] suitable to these arms and those of the enemy and which do not overtax the physical and moral
[00:57:02] forces of man so you gotta give them good weapons and the weapons have gotta be easy to use
[00:57:09] and suitable for the enemy that you're going against. Next we add also a rational decentralization
[00:57:16] that permits the direction and employment of the efforts of all even to the last man so we have
[00:57:23] decentralized command. I believe life and I wrote about that. Yep it's one of the fundamental principles
[00:57:31] of combat leadership. Next we animate with passion a violent desire for independence, a religious
[00:57:40] fanaticism, a rational pride, a love of glory, a madness for possession and iron discipline which
[00:57:48] permits no one to escape action secures the greatest unity from top to bottom between all elements
[00:57:55] between the commanding officers between the commanding officers and the man in between the soldiers.
[00:57:59] So those are a series of things that you can have that can fuel this right. A passion, a
[00:58:05] violent desire for independence, religious fanaticism, these are things that people fight for,
[00:58:09] a national pride, a love of glory, a madness for possession, think about that. You need what
[00:58:15] of those elements. Have we then a solid army? Not yet. Unity, the first and supreme force of
[00:58:26] armies is sought by enacting severe laws of discipline supported by powerful passions.
[00:58:32] But to order discipline is not enough, a vigilance from which no one may escape and combat
[00:58:39] should assure the maintenance of discipline. Discipline itself depends on moral pressure
[00:58:45] which activates men to advance from sentiments of fear or pride. But it depends also on surveillance
[00:58:54] the mutual supervision of groups of men who know each other well. You've got to have relationships.
[00:59:01] You've got a relationship and then the relationship has to have inherent in it. This attitude of like
[00:59:06] echo, if I see you slacking, I'm going to call you out on it. Hey bro, we don't do that here.
[00:59:11] That's not how we roll. You need to get your game on. And that's to get this mutual supervision of each other.
[00:59:18] Based on pride. Back to the book, a wise organization ensures that the personnel of combat
[00:59:27] groups changes as little as possible so that comrades and peacetime maneuvers shall be comrades and
[00:59:32] war from living together and obeying the same chiefs, from commanding the same men, from sharing
[00:59:39] fatigue and rest, from cooperation among men who quickly understand each other in the execution of
[00:59:45] warlike movements may be bread, brotherhood, professional knowledge, sentiment and above all unity.
[00:59:56] So what are we talking about there? You're building this strong bond between the people that are
[01:00:03] inside this unit. That's what you want to do and how do you do it? You're a trainem hard. They live
[01:00:07] together. They work together. They listen to the same boss. They command the same people. That's what
[01:00:12] you do. And that's when you look at military units, that's what makes them good. You go through that.
[01:00:18] You go through that hard training. You get to know your people. You build those relationships.
[01:00:24] The duty of obedience, the right of imposing discipline and the impossibility of escaping from it
[01:00:28] would naturally follow. And now confidence appears. And you know what this sounds like? It sounds like a gang.
[01:00:35] And I often said about task unit, bruiser, that I was in charge of a gang. Awesome gang.
[01:00:44] I've been an awesome gang. I did good things for the world, but they were a gang.
[01:00:49] Gang mentality for sure. You didn't want to, you didn't want to get called out by the gang.
[01:00:55] You just didn't want that to happen. When someone was messing up, when someone was doing the wrong
[01:01:00] thing, someone's cutting corners, task unit bruiser wasn't going to be, they were going to be on you.
[01:01:05] It would be on you. I never had to say anything. Guys, we're driving, we barely see it.
[01:01:09] But I'd hear about it as kind of a snoozing. We tighten them up.
[01:01:13] Oh, yeah, I'd get to go. Good to go. Back to the book. Then we have an army.
[01:01:20] And there's no longer difficult to explain how men carry away by passions, even men who know
[01:01:25] how to die without flinching, without turning pale, really strong in the presence of death,
[01:01:32] but without discipline, without solid organization, are vanquished by others,
[01:01:39] individually less valiant, but firmly, jointly, and severely combined.
[01:01:49] So, you know what you see this in the business world? You see this in the business world where
[01:01:55] where you meet people in the business world that are really passionate about what they're doing.
[01:01:59] They're really passionate. They're really into it. They've created something. They're really
[01:02:05] into it. They want to succeed. They're vusting their ass. They're really passionate about it,
[01:02:09] but they don't have the discipline. And if you don't have the discipline, the passion is not
[01:02:13] enough. You have to have the discipline too. And I don't tell you this, the passion, the discipline,
[01:02:18] the passion is also equally weak. Maybe not as weak. But it's equally weak.
[01:02:23] It's close. We'll say close. Unity and confidence cannot be improvised.
[01:02:32] They alone can create mutual trust that feeling of force which gives courage and daring.
[01:02:38] Courage, that is the temporary domination of will over instinct brings about victory.
[01:02:45] Unity alone then produces fighters. But as in everything, there are degrees of unity.
[01:02:53] Let us see whether modern is in this respect less exacting than ancient combat.
[01:03:01] These are very cool examples right here. Sometimes I'm like, I really read that whole thing.
[01:03:08] And then I think, oh yeah, I'm going to read the whole thing.
[01:03:10] So this, but these are just very cool because you're going to get a direct comparison of
[01:03:17] ancient combat psychologically and modern combat psychologically. And to understand one,
[01:03:23] it's good to have a frame of reference of the other. Back to the book, in ancient combat,
[01:03:29] there was danger only at close quarters. If the troops had enough morale to meet the enemy at
[01:03:36] broad source length, there was an engagement. Whoever was that close new that he would be killed,
[01:03:42] if he turned his back. Because as if we have seen, the victors lost but a few
[01:03:48] and the vanquished works exterminated. That's this simple reasoning held the men and made them fight.
[01:03:56] If it was but for an instant. So we already talked about that. You think you're going to die?
[01:04:01] You're going to fight or die? You're going to fight. You're going to release give it a shot.
[01:04:06] Neglecting the exceptional and very rare circumstances, which may bring two forces together,
[01:04:12] action today is brought out on and fought out from afar. Danger begins at great distances.
[01:04:20] And it is necessary to advance for a long time under fire at each step with the
[01:04:26] in which each step becomes heavier. The vanquished loses prisoners but often,
[01:04:33] in dead and wounded, he does not lose more than the victor. Sorry, I talked about that.
[01:04:39] Ancient combat was fought in groups close together with a small space in open ground in full
[01:04:44] view of one another without the deafening noise of present day arms. Men information,
[01:04:50] marches into action that took place on the spot and did not carry them thousands of feet away
[01:04:55] from the starting point. The surveillance of the leaders was easy. Individual weakness was immediately
[01:05:01] checked. General consternation alone caused flight. Today, fighting is done over immense
[01:05:10] spaces. Along thinly drawn outlines broken every instant by the accidents and the obstacles of the terrain.
[01:05:18] From time from the time action begins as soon as there are rifle shots, the men spread out as
[01:05:24] skirmishers or lost in the inevitable disorder of the rapid march escape the supervision of their
[01:05:31] commanding officers. Considerable number, conceal themselves. They get away from the engagement and
[01:05:39] diminished by just so much the material morale effect and confidence of the brave one,
[01:05:46] ones who remain. This can bring about defeat. Modern combat and again were in 1860s.
[01:05:55] You start charging and the lines broken up and the commanding officer can't so if you're thinking
[01:06:01] maybe you want to just live through this one, you might just get down a little trench, get down a little
[01:06:04] depression, get behind a tree and sit there and wait. But if we're online in ancient combat,
[01:06:10] there was nowhere to go. The commander could see you and your buddies could see you. Back to the book.
[01:06:20] But let us look at man himself and ancient and modern combat. In ancient combat, this is cool.
[01:06:26] In ancient combat, I am strong, apt, vigorous, trained, full of calmness, presence of mind.
[01:06:33] I have good offensive and defensive weapons and trustworthy companions of long-standing.
[01:06:40] They do not let me be overwhelmed without aiding me. I with them, they with me,
[01:06:46] we are invincible even invulnerable. We have fought 20 battles and not one of us remained on the field.
[01:06:52] It is necessary to pour each other into support each other in time.
[01:06:56] Covered move. We see it clearly. We are quick to replace ourselves to put a fresh combatant in front of
[01:07:01] a fatigue adversary. We are the legions, 50,000 who have held out against the furious avalanches of
[01:07:10] the Kimberi. We have killed 140,000 taking prisoner 60,000 while losing but two or 300 of our
[01:07:18] inexperienced soldiers. That is sort of a mentality. Back in the day. When I say back in the
[01:07:25] day, I am talking ancient times, way back in the day. Now here is the modern soldier, at least 1860
[01:07:32] soldier. Today, as strong, firm, trained and courageous as I am, I can never say I shall return.
[01:07:44] I have no longer to do with men who might do not fear. I have to do with fate in the form
[01:07:54] of iron and lead. Death is in the air, invisible and blind, whispering, whistling, as brave,
[01:08:04] good trustworthy and devoted as my companions may be. They do not shield me.
[01:08:12] Only, and this is abstract and less immediately intelligible to all than the material support of
[01:08:18] ancient combat. Only I imagine that the more numerous who we are who run a dangerous risk,
[01:08:26] the greater is the chance for which for each to escape their from. I also know that, if we have
[01:08:34] confidence which none of us should lack in action, we feel stronger and we are. We begin more
[01:08:40] resolutely, are ready to keep up the struggle longer and therefore finish it more quickly. But that
[01:08:46] is just, you know, I've talked about World War I, I don't like World War I, I don't want to fight
[01:08:51] World War I because you know, as a matter of a tactician, you are, you are just going to charge
[01:08:56] and it's going to be horrible. Well, if you take that a step further, I guess I would love to be
[01:09:02] in a situation where I'm fighting with a sword against another guy, because now I could have
[01:09:07] trained, I could rely on the guy next to me. We could, you have so much control because even
[01:09:12] World War II, any, any other modern war, like he's just saying, you're not scared of the enemy
[01:09:16] necessarily, you're scared of a random bullet, you're scared of a random piece of sharp no hitting
[01:09:21] you and that's could come at any time. So it's the psychology is very, very different.
[01:09:29] Back to the modern soldier here, we finish it, but in order to finish it is necessary to advance
[01:09:33] to attack the enemy and infantrymen or troopers, we are naked against iron, naked against
[01:09:41] lead, which cannot miss at close range. So again, you against me with a sword, we got a battle,
[01:09:50] right? You against me with a gun if you get your shot off him dead. Is it? I'm naked against that.
[01:09:56] There's no shield. I'm going to stop it. I mean, now we have body armor, but your chance
[01:10:00] of getting hit in the body armor, although it's saved many, many lives, but it's not a
[01:10:04] definitely not a guarantee. Let us advance in any case, resolute the our adversary will not
[01:10:11] stand up to the point blank range of our rifle. For the attack is never mutual, we are sure of that.
[01:10:18] We've been told so a thousand times that we have seen it, but what if matters should change now?
[01:10:24] Suppose the enemy stands at point blank range, what if it then? So you say, you know, who's
[01:10:30] going to stand up when you have a point blank range? How far is that from Roman confidence?
[01:10:35] In another place, we have shown that an ancient times to retire from action was both
[01:10:40] difficult and perilous matter for the soldier. Today, the temptation is much stronger.
[01:10:46] The facility greater and the peril less. Now, therefore combat execs more, more cohesion,
[01:10:56] greater unity than previously. So that's exactly what I was talking about earlier. If it
[01:11:00] will modern combat, you know, little ditched to hide and find a little doorway, you're going to get
[01:11:06] into, especially in this kind of, you know, this is a little bit pre-world war one, obviously,
[01:11:14] but they're still charging, right? They're still getting up and charging.
[01:11:22] So because everyone's all disaggregated across the battlefield, here we go, back to the
[01:11:26] book, Supervision becomes more and more difficult. Direction being more distant,
[01:11:30] tends to be, tends more often to escape from the Supreme Commanders and the subordinate leaders.
[01:11:38] The certain and inevitable disorder, which a body of troops always presents an action,
[01:11:44] is with moral effect of modern appliances becoming greater every day. So we are getting more and
[01:11:49] more spread out in the battlefield. In the midst of the confusion and the vast
[01:11:53] relation of firing lines, men and officers often lose each other. Now, we have some improvements
[01:11:59] nowadays. You know, we've got radios that are going to travel longer distances. We've got devices
[01:12:04] that allow people to know each other are. So there's some things there that we've closed up a little
[01:12:10] bit, but if you think your radio is always going to work on the battlefield here. That's why
[01:12:17] decentralized command is so important. Back to the book, in troops which do the fighting the
[01:12:22] men and officers closest to them from corporal to batain commander have a more independent action
[01:12:28] than ever. Right. We've got to have our troops know what's going on. As it is alone, the
[01:12:33] bigger of that action, more independent than ever, the direction of higher commanders,
[01:12:37] which leaves the hands of higher commanders available forces, which can be directed at a decisive
[01:12:43] moment. The action becomes more preponderant than ever. Battles now more than ever are battles
[01:12:50] of men and captains. So this is pure decentralized command. It's pure, letting making sure that
[01:12:56] everyone knows what the commander's intent is and they can execute out of the battlefield without
[01:13:00] you having to tell them what to do. They better know what to do on their own.
[01:13:06] This completes the demonstration of the truth state before. Combat requires today in order to
[01:13:12] give the best results a moral cohesion. A unity more binding than at any other time.
[01:13:20] It is as true as it is clear that if one does not wish the bonds to break, one must make
[01:13:29] them elastic in order to strengthen them. Very, very, very, very, very, very poignant that. Right?
[01:13:41] Because the more we train control things, the less control we're going to have in these
[01:13:46] matte modern combat and it business and in life the more constructive you are that the more rigid
[01:13:54] you are, the less control you're going to have. It's just not going to be able to flex and flow
[01:13:58] with all the craziness that happens out on the battle. It's not going to work.
[01:14:04] decentralized command all day. Back to the book, the art of wars subjected to many modifications
[01:14:14] by industrial and scientific progress, but one thing does not change the heart of man.
[01:14:19] In the last analysis, success in battles a matter of morale. In all matters which pertain to an
[01:14:26] army, organization, discipline and tactics, the human heart in the supreme moment of battle is the
[01:14:31] basic factor. It is rarely taken into account and often strange errors are the result. Witness the
[01:14:39] carbine and accurate long-range weapon which has never given the service expected of it because it
[01:14:46] was used mechanically without considering the human heart we must consider it. With improvement in
[01:14:52] weapons, the power of destruction increases, the moral effect of such weapon increases and
[01:14:57] courage to face them becomes rare. Man does not cannot change. What should increase the power of material
[01:15:07] is the strength of organization, the unity of the fighting machine. Yet these are the most neglected.
[01:15:13] So we run into this all time with with echelon front, right? We are leadership.
[01:15:20] That's what we talk about. That's what we talk about as leadership. And oftentimes when we work
[01:15:24] with a company, what their focus on trying to fix the problem that they have, they focus on
[01:15:29] the symptom, right? They focus on the process that this must be messed up or we've got people that
[01:15:34] aren't following our instructions or we've got growth that we're trying to maintain and it's not
[01:15:42] coming out the way we want to. But they're looking at, they're not looking at the human heart, right?
[01:15:47] And that's the first thing we look at. That's the main thing we look at. And I'll tell you this
[01:15:52] 100% of the time when we go to a company and no matter what the problem is, no matter what the
[01:15:59] problem is, I will tell you the solution of the problem is with the leadership period in the story,
[01:16:06] period in the story. Oh, we've got a process that's messed up. Okay, who's in charge of the process?
[01:16:10] Give me that person's name. I'll talk him. Let's get a leadership working.
[01:16:14] Oh, we've got decisions that are being made. Well, that's a leadership problem. We've got manufacturing.
[01:16:19] That's that's not up to speed. It's not good quality. Is that the manufacturing problem?
[01:16:26] Is that the problem with the machines? No, there's a leader. That's in charge of that.
[01:16:31] That is allowing this slack to happen. It is about leadership. It is about the human heart.
[01:16:37] It's what is it about? What is it about? He said that before about morale.
[01:16:42] Talk about morale. I think even one of the books said they do something to lower their morale.
[01:16:49] Like they're attacking their morale. I think I feel like everything might have been the
[01:16:52] chetions of a forget. Yeah, but well, every army does that. Oh, they try to attack the morale of the enemy.
[01:16:58] If you can beat the morale, you're going to beat the army in many cases. Yeah, because so it's kind of like
[01:17:04] if you make them not want to fight, they're not going to really want to fight or not going to fight.
[01:17:08] That's what makes you know in the Vietnam War, what hurt our morale so bad, booby traps.
[01:17:15] What hurt our morale so bad, mortar fire, sniper fire, and you're losing guys,
[01:17:20] but you're not having anyone to engage against. Yeah. And you're not taking any ground holding it.
[01:17:25] That's one thing they did nicely in Iraq. We could see that we were making progress.
[01:17:30] And so although we'd take, you know, your hard-brying stand talk about it in the area where he was,
[01:17:36] there was progress was made. And you can look at it and see it. And so therefore you're making these sacrifices,
[01:17:42] but you know that there's progress occurring. Yeah. And so that you're taking hits to your morale,
[01:17:47] but your morale is also building back up because you know that you're making progress. Yeah.
[01:17:55] This is an interesting comment.
[01:17:58] For brave men who do not know each other will not dare attack a lion.
[01:18:02] For less brave, but knowing each other well, sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid,
[01:18:10] will attack resolutely. There is the science of organization of armies in a nutshell.
[01:18:18] Now this is kind of a strange thing to me because I understand what he's saying.
[01:18:22] But I have no, I don't know what they mean by attack a lion.
[01:18:25] Well, we got guns. Do we have swords? It seems like a lion.
[01:18:31] Before guys, I don't like those chances. What do you do? You can't do a take down on a lion.
[01:18:36] You do the Matalio. Yeah, I know you did a mountain lion. Yeah, I understand that.
[01:18:41] But I think it was a metaphor. Yeah. No, I know. It's a good metaphor. But I try to take things, you know,
[01:18:45] or sometimes I think a thing is a realistic way. If you ever seen the claws on a lion, yeah.
[01:18:49] Yeah, no, no. Four guys, there was a lion. I don't think it's going to work out. Good. If you have no weapons.
[01:18:52] If you have some weapons, but you don't want to be the one guy like, you know, the sacrificial guy that does the first attack.
[01:18:58] So I can get to the neck. Echo. You run at him, bro. I got your back.
[01:19:03] I'm going to run up and stab it in the head. But that's after you got a
[01:19:08] jugular removed by his claw. But see what he's saying is if you can rely on me. Yeah, for sure.
[01:19:13] You'll do it. I don't know if I can really rely on myself being the big though.
[01:19:21] Check. Back to the book. Anytime a new invention may assure victory. At any time a new
[01:19:27] invention may assure victory. Granted, but practical weapons are not invented every day and nations quickly put themselves on the same footing
[01:19:34] and as regards to armament. The determining factor leaving aside
[01:19:39] generals of genius and luck is the quality of the troops. That is the organization that best assures the
[01:19:44] esprit, reliability, the confidence in the union. Again, we're just talking about the technology comes out.
[01:19:50] That's great. There's something more important than that. And that is the the relationships.
[01:19:55] The relationships. That's what's most important. Back to the book. The purpose of discipline is to
[01:20:05] make men fight in spite of themselves. No army is worth. No army is worthy of the name without discipline.
[01:20:14] There is no army at all without organization and organization is defective which neglects
[01:20:19] neglects any means to strengthen the unity of combatants. Methods cannot be identical. This is so
[01:20:27] so important. Methods cannot be identical. So you can just throw this discipline all the same to
[01:20:33] everyone. Listen to this. Tracony in discipline does not fit our customs. Discipline must be a
[01:20:40] state of mind, a social institution based on salient virtues and defects of the nations.
[01:20:46] Discipline cannot be secured or created in a day. It is an institution. A tradition
[01:20:55] the commander must have confidence in his right to command. He must be a customs to command
[01:21:01] and proud to command. This is what strengthens discipline in armies commanded by an aristocracy in
[01:21:09] certain countries. So I just think it's very important because again, I don't want people to listen
[01:21:15] to the podcast to go, that's right. We're going to lay down the discipline now at the company.
[01:21:20] Everyone's going to follow the rules. No. It can't be dracony and it's got to be a part of the
[01:21:24] culture. People got to want there to be discipline. Very important. Back to the book, ancient
[01:21:32] battle resembled drill and when they say drill, you're ever seeing people marching like on a parade
[01:21:36] ground. That's drill. Okay. Ancient battle resembled drill. There is no such resemblance in modern
[01:21:42] battle. This greatly disconserts both officers and soldiers. Ancient battles were picknicks for the
[01:21:49] victors who lost nobody, not so today. Artillery played no part in ancient battle. The invention
[01:21:56] of firearms has diminished losses in battle. Again, you can see he was not 100% correct because
[01:22:05] he couldn't see into the future, but he's saying at the time there was less losses in battle
[01:22:10] because of the firearms. Obviously that turned out to be true just to what 50 years later in World War
[01:22:19] one, we get to obscene and horrible levels of casualties from the firearms. Why is that? Because
[01:22:26] they can, well, as far as what he said, because they could fire from a safe fire. Yeah, I'm sure
[01:22:31] it's because they could fire from a safe spot. And the momentum of the battle and therefore
[01:22:38] victory in defeat could occur at a greater distance and it meant that once that occurred,
[01:22:46] the people could run away. Yeah. And so we were losing, we're going to run away. Whereas no
[01:22:50] days, we're in the game. We start to beat you. I'm hacking your head off and all of the people
[01:22:55] with you and you're trying to run away. We got archers lined up and we're all we're all on a football
[01:22:59] field. You know, maybe maybe five or six football fields. You know, thousand yards, maybe ten
[01:23:03] football fields. We're all there. And when we start getting the upper hand, you're not going to
[01:23:08] get away from me. In fact, you're, I mean, according to him, you turn your back to run away. Yeah,
[01:23:12] that's guaranteed. Yeah. Whereas, hey, we can retreat. We can surrender. And then we guess what?
[01:23:17] I mean, modern modern surrenders, you know, they take place almost like a formal,
[01:23:22] yeah, you know, you come in your general comes and surrounds signs the paper and then we take over
[01:23:27] your country. Yeah. You know, whatever. Signs of the paper. Yeah, no, they signed, they signed surrender
[01:23:33] papers. There really ends your pan, both signed, you know, on conditional surrenders. Yeah,
[01:23:38] that sounded kind of like, which is how you're supposed to win wars. Yeah, on conditional surrender.
[01:23:43] And then the beloved benevolence of our country says, okay, now we'll, we'll help you rebuild.
[01:23:49] And, you know, you can be a square away democracy. Hey, remember, um, just the,
[01:23:54] here's a question. So in war, like, if you're, like, on the save of our own,
[01:23:58] and there's a small little clip where the guys are like surrendering, and they still shoot them.
[01:24:02] Is that like illegal, like, can't do that? Yeah, you're not supposed to do that. Yeah.
[01:24:06] Yep. It is illegal. It's against the law of armed combat. Remember, the first Iraq war
[01:24:12] when the guys were like, so finding anything they could that was going to happen. I got asked that on
[01:24:16] on social media guys like, well, what determines? I said, you know, where you, you have to do the right thing
[01:24:21] in combat. So what the sort of who determines the right thing? I was like, well, the Geneva convention
[01:24:24] of the law of armed combat. Next question. Like, there's a rule to follow. Yeah. It's like we're pulling
[01:24:28] it, you know, out of thin air. Yeah. It's not a, you know, making it up as we go. Yeah, making it
[01:24:36] back to the book. The greater perfection of weapons, the more dreadful becomes modern battle
[01:24:41] and discipline becomes more difficult to maintain. That's a wide, so awesome. When you see
[01:24:47] the US Marine Corps doing the island hopping campaign and the amount of discipline that it takes
[01:24:57] to go, when you're dug in and you're in a bunker, you're a Japanese imperial soldier and you're
[01:25:04] in a bunker and you have a machine gun and your sights are set on the beach. The amount of
[01:25:11] discipline that it takes to go on to that beach is an American Marine or sailor, corpsman or army
[01:25:19] soldier that's coming on. It's just incredible. It's absolutely incredibly defies what the peak
[01:25:24] is saying. Some of the stuff that the peak says about fear and all this and guys are going to turn.
[01:25:29] Apparently, you never work with the US Marine Corps. Apparently, never work with the
[01:25:33] hundred first airborne. Those guys? No. I mean, I'm calling out a couple units, but come on,
[01:25:39] these guys are, it's amazing. It's amazing. The amount of heroism and discipline to overcome
[01:25:48] that that spirit of self-preservation. And obviously, but, you know, tons of special operations
[01:25:56] to guys and just it's impressive. It really is. It is very impressive. I was humbled to see that
[01:26:06] stuff and with my own two eyes. Back to the book, the nature of ancient arms requires close order
[01:26:13] modern arms require open order. And they are at the same time of such terrible power that
[01:26:20] against them too often disciplines broken. So imagine this, this is tough because in ancient
[01:26:26] war, we're all close together. And so it's easier to maintain discipline. But when we all get spread
[01:26:31] out modern war, it's harder to maintain the discipline. Yeah, plus nobody's looking to. Yeah.
[01:26:36] Discipline and battle becomes more necessary as ranks become more open. And the material cohesion
[01:26:42] of the ranks, not giving confidence. It must spring from a knowledge of comrades and a trust
[01:26:48] in officers who must always be present and seen. So leaders, you gotta be seen.
[01:26:55] What man today advances with the confidence that rigid discipline and pride of an in himself
[01:27:00] gave the Roman soldier, even though the contest is no longer with man, but with fate.
[01:27:07] Think about that. The contest in modern warfare oftentimes, not all the time,
[01:27:13] is fate. Am I going to step on an ID? Am I going to get hit by a random bullet? Am I going to
[01:27:19] there's the war now is much more random. It's much more random. Bad luck can cost your life. Good
[01:27:28] luck can save your life. Good tactics will put more luck on your side. Bad tactics will turn luck
[01:27:35] against you, but there's always luck involved in modern warfare. So that's what you're up against
[01:27:40] your up against fate. So you know what I'll tell you? Like when he talks about this modern warfare
[01:27:49] of, you know, and even when I talk about like, hey guys going out the turret, you know,
[01:27:54] guys going out on the operation after operation in the money, sometimes you know, guys would think
[01:28:00] they're going to die. But a lot of times like, no, I'm not going to get killed. It's not going to happen.
[01:28:04] You have the sort of hey, it's not going to happen. If it does, I won't know it. Check.
[01:28:10] Let's rock and roll. You know what I mean? It's a different. So I want to make sure that I'm not
[01:28:15] making it sound like the lead turret gunner is sitting up there going out tonight. It's the night.
[01:28:20] He overcomes that in one of the ways you overcome this. Yeah, that's not going to happen to me.
[01:28:25] It's not going to happen to me. You know, we've heard that from some other books. You know, they don't
[01:28:28] think it's going to happen to yourself. It's going to happen to that guy. It might happen to the guy
[01:28:32] next to me. I'm going to be good to go. It's like when you're on a plane and you think this plane,
[01:28:38] you know, if this plane crashes, you know, a big commercial plane jetliner or whatever,
[01:28:42] I think I'm going to live. Like, guys, my attitude is like, if this thing crashes, I will live.
[01:28:48] You know, I'm going to I will land somewhere and track using my free fall capabilities and I'll
[01:28:57] find a pool and I'll track to the pool and then I'll get all spread out in the last minute. I'm
[01:29:02] going to, you know, I think I'm going to live like if you fall out of the plane. No, if the plane
[01:29:06] explodes in midair, right, and you fall out. Like, you know, those crashes where everyone dies on the plane.
[01:29:11] Yes. If I'm on the plane, I'm going to make it. Right. The only one. That's like the attitude.
[01:29:16] So you can, you can, if I can have that attitude about being on a plane, I can have that attitude and a
[01:29:20] bunch of guys can have that attitude going into combat. Like, hey, I'm not going to get killed.
[01:29:25] Bring it. What do you got? Yeah. They can go, I think that's called availability bias. I
[01:29:31] think that goes both ways. It's like what's the availability? What availability means it's,
[01:29:36] I mean, the way that the reason they call it availability is because it's available in your mind.
[01:29:41] Just that thought. You know, it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's basically is that one girl that
[01:29:47] lived through one of those crashes back in 1975. I'm like, hey, she could do it. I'm like,
[01:29:52] that's good. I remember. I always hear about that hero story, even though all the other millions of
[01:29:57] stories everybody that like like winning the lottery. It's why people buy lottery tickets, even though
[01:30:02] you'd like the chance of you dying on the way to buy a lot of tickets higher than you winning in the
[01:30:06] year. Oh, I'm a little bad. I'm a little bit. It's going to be someone might as well be me.
[01:30:11] Can't win if you don't play.
[01:30:16] Yeah, so I think I think a lot of guys have that same attitude as I'm talking about. And I know
[01:30:20] they do because I talked to them about it. You're not, maybe not specific, but no one's going, oh,
[01:30:24] you know, I'm really, you know, I'm really, you know, believe me, we get guys that think they're
[01:30:28] going to die every 10 that go out. You know, got some paranoid brothers that'd be like,
[01:30:31] and I don't feel good about this one. Because you know, you can be okay, buddy. Yeah, yeah. No, man.
[01:30:36] I don't know who, who, who, what's the shot? That's brilliant. Yeah. Even even then they sound
[01:30:42] pretty hard to go. Yeah, well, the funny thing is like one of my most paranoid
[01:30:47] brothers that was always paranoid who's going to die. He always, in fact, I was going to send him home.
[01:30:51] Not, they used the ended deployment. Yeah. And we had planes and we had to fill up the planes with
[01:30:56] guys to go home. And one of the other guys, the senior guy said to me like, hey, we need to,
[01:31:00] we need to send that guy home. You know, he's really stressed out. And I said, bro, he's not going to
[01:31:04] go home. Because I know, yeah. Oh, like if you say, go home, he won't want to go home. Yeah, he's not going
[01:31:10] on. Oh, this is the guy that would be like, man, this is what we should be doing this off, man. I
[01:31:13] got that feeling about tonight, man. And I'd be a man. It's cool. You know, you're going to be all right.
[01:31:18] I think you can be all right, bro. And then so this other senior guy comes to me and says, hey,
[01:31:25] you know, you got to get this guy on a plane. And I go, bro, he's not going to go home. I know
[01:31:29] him. He's not going home. He's not going to want to go home. Dude, he's freaking out. I go, yeah, this is the
[01:31:32] way he is. Just his way of dealing with it. Any good school, you've got to send him home. And I
[01:31:37] go, I'm not going to send him home because we'll go ask him if he wants to go home. And I go, okay,
[01:31:43] so you know, we're going to launch or something in our little hut. And I go, hey, man, I want to get you
[01:31:49] on, you know, one of these early plans going home because fuck you. I'm not going anywhere. I was like,
[01:31:53] cool man, rock back. He's like, oh, what do you, he's like, what do you say? He's going to fuck
[01:31:57] him? Okay, cool. Look, guys, we can stay here. And, you know what, he did 10 more deployments after that
[01:32:02] deployment, you know what I mean? So he's a guy that like, like, I don't know, that's just the way
[01:32:07] he dealt with it. Yeah. With it through, bit. It's voicing and voicing is nervousness, but he just did
[01:32:12] it out loud. Change smoke and cigarettes. Get an after it and would never ever want to stay back
[01:32:18] off an operational matter. What it was, he said, you know, if I ever didn't put him on the
[01:32:23] forced list of the guys going out, he'd come to me like, what's the problem? Give me on there.
[01:32:28] Oh, yeah, bro. I can't leave him back. Yeah, it's just how, so it was, it probably wasn't the kind where
[01:32:34] he really did want to go home, but like how you say in the earlier, the culture kind of, I don't know what's
[01:32:39] inside of his head. Yeah. But definitely part of it is like, hey, I'm not going to be a pussy. I'm,
[01:32:44] I might be talking like I'm scared. Yeah. And like I don't want to do this. Don't you dare
[01:32:49] try and send me home. Yeah. Yeah. Now let me have another cigarette. I get after it. And yeah,
[01:32:58] actually that guy just retired one of my, one of my awesome brothers. Well, when, when they say,
[01:33:04] when the guys are like, oh, it's not going to happen to me, right? When you know about tying
[01:33:08] and stuff, is that do you think that they really feel that it's not going to happen to me? Or is that
[01:33:14] a thing that they sort of tell themselves? Well, I can tell you that oftentimes I did not think
[01:33:18] I could be killed. Yeah. You know anyway, this is not going to happen. Right. I bring it. Yeah. Go ahead,
[01:33:25] bring it. And and I guess part of that a little 10% of that was like, hey, if I do get killed,
[01:33:31] whatever, I could go, you know, this is this kind of a good way to die. Right. I don't mind that way of
[01:33:37] dying, getting killed in combat. Right. I'm a Viking with a sword and I want to die within my hands.
[01:33:42] I don't want to die the way I'm going to die now. You know, now I got to live and
[01:33:48] get, do all this stuff. Right. That's pretty cool too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, but technically. Yeah.
[01:33:55] But so there's a little bit of that. But I think guys probably fall in that whole spectrum. Yeah.
[01:33:59] Guys just didn't think they would get killed. And guys that just said they didn't think they
[01:34:03] could get killed. And guys that thought they really didn't get killed, but really didn't think they
[01:34:06] were getting killed. There's just man, you know what's going on. So as people inside people
[01:34:10] head, but what you got to do is pay as much attention to it as you can. And always be looking at
[01:34:17] people and trying to gauge where they're at mentally. Because yeah, it does. It does
[01:34:24] freak people out, you know, the continual specter of death. They can hang heavy. That's the end.
[01:34:31] And you know, I was never exposed to the kind of things that these people were going through.
[01:34:35] And World War II going on to go on to a beach going on where you're, you know, we're going to take
[01:34:41] 40% casualties first two waves. You know, that means you're looking at your body like, okay,
[01:34:47] one of us ain't going to make it or one of us is at least going to get wounded bad. I was doing
[01:34:51] some more, I was doing some reading, you know, just some World War II reading. It's just crazy.
[01:34:57] How those guys were going, I mean, D days the same thing. D day, they found that you're going
[01:35:01] to take even worse casualties and they did. You know, actually the first goal for, I remember here in
[01:35:06] a port on on the news. I think it was CNN. Because yeah, it was the one CNN because I was the only
[01:35:10] cable news I think at the time. They was saying there's going to be 40,000 casualties in the first 48
[01:35:15] hours. I was like, oh, it's all. I'm going to get some. And that was literally my attitude, you know,
[01:35:20] and of course it was over in 72 hours and nothing happened. That's why I think that lowered us into
[01:35:25] a false sense of security and arrogance. The second goal for me said, oh, we're going to go into
[01:35:29] Iraq. Oh, yeah, I won't, you know, probably be done in two or three months or maybe a month. You know,
[01:35:32] maybe a month. And guess what, we got up to Baghdad in one, a couple, a couple weeks a week or two.
[01:35:37] And boom, we were there. Okay, this is going to be has this. Yeah, well, guess what? We looked, we didn't,
[01:35:42] we weren't expecting that insurgency to form and we didn't do a good job of transitioning the
[01:35:48] government properly. So we made some, I can't say we made some mistakes. Okay, I can say this,
[01:35:55] we made mistakes, but we, you don't know what's going to happen in war, right? We don't know the answers.
[01:36:03] If we knew what the answers were, we would do everything perfectly. You just don't know. It's like,
[01:36:08] it's like playing a football game, right? You don't know what's going to happen. Not only you
[01:36:14] not know what the opponent's going to do, you don't know what passes are going to be caught and
[01:36:18] dropped and what the ref's going to call. There's all these variables that you just cannot know.
[01:36:22] The only way you can know the outcome of a football game is to play the football game, right?
[01:36:25] The only way you can know what's going to happen in a war is the war happens and things are
[01:36:28] going to happen that you will not expect ever and you got to deal with. And we were a little slow
[01:36:33] to recognize, but again, we had false sense security. Hey, we beat these guys last time in 72 hours.
[01:36:40] Okay, we want to take their country. So what's that going to mean? Two weeks? We should be good to go.
[01:36:44] You can never do that. You got to be ready for the long haul. Back to the book. In ancient
[01:36:50] battle, unity existed, at least with the Greeks and the Romans. The soldier was known to his officer
[01:36:55] in comrades. They saw that he fought. In modern armies, where losses are as great for the
[01:37:02] victor as the vanquished, the soldier must more often be replaced. In ancient battle, the victor
[01:37:08] had no losses or very limited losses. Today, the soldier is often unknown to his comrades. He is
[01:37:15] lost in the smoke. He's the dispersion, the confusion of battle. He seems to fight alone. Unity is no
[01:37:22] longer insured by mutual surveillance. A man falls in disappears. Who knows whether it was a bullet
[01:37:31] or the fear of advancing further than struck him. And again, we're talking, these guys are doing
[01:37:37] sort of world war one style advances charges on positions. The ancient combat was never struck by
[01:37:44] an invisible weapon. It could not fall this way. The more difficult surveillance, the more necessary
[01:37:51] becomes the individuality of companies, sections, and squads. Dispersion brings us back to the
[01:37:59] necessity for the unity, which was the absolute necessity in ancient battle. So, another point here,
[01:38:08] the size of the battlefield permits less than ever holding units together. The role of the
[01:38:13] generals much more difficult. Many more chances are left to fate. Thus, the greater necessity
[01:38:18] for the troops who know best their trade, who are most dependable, and the greatest of fortitude.
[01:38:25] So, you gotta have even better soldiers now. Because you got a train, and better. Because there
[01:38:29] might be out there alone, or you know what two or three guys. There is a strange similarity in
[01:38:37] battle at one league to battle at two places. So, one league, meaning separated by 2,000 meters,
[01:38:43] 2 places, and obviously, 2 places. The value of the soldier is the essential element of success.
[01:38:52] Let us strengthen the soldier by unity. And this is obviously, this is businesses, this is teams.
[01:39:00] The tighter you are as a group, the better you're going to perform. Work that unity.
[01:39:04] The good quality of troops will more than ever secure victory.
[01:39:15] Nothing should be neglected to make the battle order stronger and the man stronger.
[01:39:23] This is good. When incomplete security, after dinner, in full physical and moral
[01:39:29] contentment, men consider war and battle they are animated by a noble arguer that has nothing
[01:39:37] in common with reality. Helmet. So, everyone is all brave when they're at the dinner table.
[01:39:43] The full bellies. How many of them, however, even at that moment, would be ready to risk their lives.
[01:39:48] So, even when they're at the dinner table, talking. Really, at that moment, how many people are ready to
[01:39:52] risk their lives. But, obliged them to march for days and weeks to arrive at the battle ground.
[01:39:57] And on the day of battle, obliged them to wait minutes hours to deliver it. If they were honest,
[01:40:02] they would testify how much the physical fatigue and the mental anguish that proceed,
[01:40:06] action have lowered them morale. How much less eager to fight, they are
[01:40:12] then a month before when they rose from the table in a generous mood.
[01:40:18] Man's heart is changeable as fortune. Man shrinks back and apprehends danger.
[01:40:26] In any effort in which he does not foresee success.
[01:40:31] So, when we don't think we're going to be successful, we shrink back. We get worried about it.
[01:40:36] There are some isolated characters of iron-temper who resist the tendency, but they are
[01:40:41] carried away by the great minority. The examples show that if withdrawal is forced,
[01:40:46] the army is discouraged and takes flight. The brave heart does not change. Real bravery,
[01:40:52] inspired by devotion to duty, does not know panic and is always the same. The bravery
[01:40:58] sprung from a hot blood pleases the Frenchman more. He understands that it appeals to his vanity.
[01:41:06] It is a characteristic of his nature, but it is passing. It fails him at times, especially
[01:41:14] when there's nothing for him to gain by doing his duty. So, this is like motivation
[01:41:18] being fickle. If you're super fired up and now you want to go, that's going to fade away.
[01:41:24] That's not the kind of bravery we're looking for. We're looking for the constant steady bravery.
[01:41:31] The instinct of self-preservation can then make the strongest tremble,
[01:41:37] but they are strong enough to overcome their emotion, the fear of advancing, even losing their heads
[01:41:42] or their coolness. Fear with them never come becomes terror. It is forgotten in the activities of command.
[01:41:49] He who does not feel strong enough to keep his heart from ever being gripped by terror should
[01:41:54] never think of becoming an officer. Don't become an officer if you're going to get really
[01:42:03] scared. The soldiers themselves have emotions. Have emotion. The sense of duty discipline
[01:42:08] pride in the example of their officers and above all their coolness sustain them and prevent
[01:42:12] their fear from becoming terror. Their emotion never allows them to cite or
[01:42:19] to more than approximately adjust their fire. Often they fire into the air.
[01:42:24] Cromwell knew this well. Dependable as his troops were when he said, put your trust in God and
[01:42:31] aim at their shoelaces. That's something that we still teach. You know, when you're in a firefight,
[01:42:37] you shoot low. Shoot at the ground in front of the bad guys. Because you'll hit ricochets,
[01:42:42] the bullets will walk up into the bad guys. Ricochets will put stuff in their face and
[01:42:48] you'll at least hit something. If you aim high, you're going to shoot over the hands and hit
[01:42:52] nothing. Yeah, wasn't um. Oh, Roger Roger. He was saying he was kind of saying that right.
[01:42:59] Like the new guy's shoot a tent to shoot. Oh, yeah, for sure. He definitely said that. Yeah.
[01:43:03] No, they drilled us into that. Did you all die in a big time? Yeah, walk it in. Yeah.
[01:43:08] Walk it in. Shoot it in the laces. And that's another thing. When you're shooting high,
[01:43:12] you don't know where I went. When you shoot the ground, you can see we're hitting. You're like,
[01:43:15] okay, boom, I'm walking in. Walking in. Walking on in. What makes this soldier capable of obedience
[01:43:23] and direction and action is the sense of discipline. This includes respect for and confidence
[01:43:29] and his chiefs confidence in his comrades and fear of their approaches and retaliation if he
[01:43:33] abandons them in danger. This is peer pressure. Basically is what we're talking about.
[01:43:38] His desire to go where others do go without trembling more than they in a word, the whole of the
[01:43:45] speed of core. Organization only can produce these characteristics. Four men equal a lion.
[01:43:53] It is as predacor is secured in war, but war becomes shorter and shorter and more and more
[01:44:01] violent. Consequently secure a speed decor in advance. This is about training. That's what we're
[01:44:07] going to establish a speed of core. Mental equatemanship. This is a weird word for like friendship
[01:44:12] or brotherhood, mental acquaintance ship. It is not enough to make a good organization. A good
[01:44:19] general spree is needed. All were all must work for battle and not merely live quietly going through
[01:44:27] the drills without understanding their application. So you've got everyone understand what's going on.
[01:44:32] They got to understand why they're doing what they're doing. Once a man knows how to use his weapon
[01:44:36] and obey all commands, there is need. Needed only occasional drill to brush up those who have
[01:44:42] forgotten. Marches and battle maneuvers are what's needed. So don't just run the simple drills that
[01:44:48] people know, this is the training that I used to run was battle maneuvers. That's what we're doing.
[01:44:52] And marches. Yes, you're going to get your long walk on. You're going to get conditioned. You're
[01:44:56] going to get tired. You're going to get fatigued. You're going to get after it. And you're going to
[01:45:00] get tested. And then some crazy stuff was going to happen. It's going to be mayhem. It's how we get
[01:45:04] guys ready for combat. The technical training of the soldiers, not the most difficult. It is
[01:45:09] necessary for him to know how to use and take care of his weapon to know how to move the right
[01:45:13] into the left forward and back. But this is not what makes a soldier. It's absolutely necessary to
[01:45:20] change the instruction. He's talking about how the instructions being run. He's talking how it should
[01:45:24] be run. He's absolutely necessary to change the instruction to reduce it to the necessary
[01:45:28] minimum and to cut out all sorts of super, superfluous information with which peacetime laborers
[01:45:35] overloaded each year. To know the essential well is better than having some knowledge of a lot of
[01:45:42] things. Many of them useless. Teach this in the first year. Then in the second, the essential.
[01:45:49] Also instruction should be simple to avoid mental fatigue of long drills that discussed everybody.
[01:45:55] So keep it simple. So that is the viewpoint on training. That is what you have to do.
[01:46:03] Back to the book. When confidence is placed in superiority of material means,
[01:46:12] valuable is they are against the enemy at a distance. It may be betrayed by the actions of the
[01:46:18] enemy. If he closes with you in spite of your superiority, it means of destruction, the morale of the
[01:46:25] enemy mounts with the loss of your confidence. His morale dominates yours. You flee entrenched
[01:46:32] troops. Did you understand that? If you are stronger than me, but I attack you. You might just
[01:46:39] get on your heels and lose. If you think about it, you see this in film footage in World War I.
[01:46:44] People would take it. They would take the trenches. You are in a distance position. You have
[01:46:48] got covered. You have got a consumer. You have got barbed wire, but someone still can come in.
[01:46:51] When they do you run. You have seen those videos on YouTube with the squirrel attacks the dog.
[01:46:58] But it is like this big dog. But the squirrel gets nuts. Is that a point?
[01:47:03] They are squirrel getting nuts. You are getting a good with that one.
[01:47:09] That was a chance. When you am out when you get nuts, you are getting nuts.
[01:47:15] You are not. It is weird that we talk about that because I was talking about that.
[01:47:22] When you are a kid, you see someone losing their temper. You see them getting nuts.
[01:47:28] That is impressive. That is true. Somebody gets nuts.
[01:47:32] If you are an experienced fighter, you see someone getting nuts.
[01:47:35] You have got to get a winded about 35 more seconds.
[01:47:38] Is that crazy? That is essentially a fight. He is trained.
[01:47:43] He is trained. He is trained out of the human element.
[01:47:46] He is talking about instinctual.
[01:47:48] Good fighter. He is trained out of the human element.
[01:47:52] That is exactly what happens with the training fighter.
[01:47:54] But this shows you how that momentum and battle and business and anything.
[01:48:02] How many attack you? You are stronger than me.
[01:48:04] That is why it is aggressive.
[01:48:06] Default mode is aggressive. That is why.
[01:48:10] Even advancing, even by advancing you affect the morale of the enemy.
[01:48:13] But your object is to dominate him and make him retreat before your ascendancy.
[01:48:19] And it is certain that everything that diminishes the enemy's morale adds to your
[01:48:24] resolution and advancing. So call on the attack. Be offensive. Be aggressive.
[01:48:31] The mere attack does not completely succeed against such troops.
[01:48:35] It is necessary to destroy them. Again, I always like to point that out because as we are
[01:48:45] sitting here talking, we are even me. We are starting to think about chess game and video game
[01:48:50] and all the stuff. But we are actually talking about killing everyone. That is what we are talking
[01:48:53] about. We can't forget that. In modern battle, which is delivered with combatants so far apart,
[01:49:01] man has come to have a horror of man. I thought that was interesting. We don't get this hand to hand
[01:49:06] combat very much anymore. These are good. He, who calm and strong of heart awaits his enemy,
[01:49:16] has all the advantage of fire. But the moral impulse of the assailant demoralizes the assailed.
[01:49:24] He is frightened. He sets his sight no longer. His sight is no longer. He does not even aim as
[01:49:29] peace. His lines are broken. So again, you are comfortable spot. This would happen to the Japanese.
[01:49:34] So the island advancing campaigns. They are bunkers down in a bunker with thousands of rounds of
[01:49:42] ammunition. And what do they see? They see United States Marine Corps coming across the beach.
[01:49:48] And they go, oh my god, who are these guys and why are they not backing down? And they got frazzled.
[01:49:54] Got overrun. With good troops on both sides, if an attack is not prepared, there is every
[01:50:01] reason to believe that it will fail. So this is so, this is where we're going back and forth.
[01:50:05] It's like each one is contrary to the other one. So he's saying, hey, if you're attacking
[01:50:08] you're going to win. But now he's saying with good troops on both sides, if an attack is not prepared,
[01:50:12] there's every reason to believe it will fail. That's because the guys that are waiting the attack
[01:50:17] have such an advantage. They're dug in. They're covered. They're, you know, the again. Look at
[01:50:21] the Japanese. They're, they're in a bunker. The Marine is on a beach, bro. You can't get any more
[01:50:29] exposed. Your weapon is wet. You're falling in the water. It's a horrible situation. We won every
[01:50:35] single time. That's amazing. He's kind of talking about all other things being equal. Yeah,
[01:50:41] saying other things being equal. If the attack is not prepared, there is every reason to believe
[01:50:45] that it will fail. The attacking troops suffer more, materialy, materialy than the defenders.
[01:50:50] The latter are in better order, fresh while the salons are in disorder, having suffered a bunch
[01:50:56] of losses and a certain amount of punishment. And be clearly, again, we're going across the beach,
[01:51:01] any beach, and fabulous invasion. Here taking losses, your disorder, debotes are crashing,
[01:51:07] you're coming through the water. People are drowning. All that stuff is really happening.
[01:51:14] The slightest, this is important. The slightest reaction by the defense
[01:51:19] made demoralized the attack. So you see that, again, see someone in a street fight,
[01:51:25] coming up and getting in your face and you just like, like, oh, really, you want something,
[01:51:28] immediately will demoralize the attack. Never mind, you know, you, you hit them or you choke them,
[01:51:34] because then now you're in a fight. But if you just, little thing made demoralized the attack,
[01:51:39] and that's why you know, in a we-trained, when we get attacked, we attack. If you shoot
[01:51:44] it us, you're going to feel the heat. The more confidence one has in his method of attack or
[01:51:50] defense, the more disc-inserted he is to see them at some time incapable of stopping the enemy.
[01:51:56] So that's another thing. You think you're all strong, but then when you start getting beat, you just
[01:52:00] fold. Fold. Interesting, just a quick comment. Back to the book, there was always mad
[01:52:12] in patience for results without considering the means. So you see this a lot in businesses,
[01:52:19] in the military, where the senior leadership, they want to see the results, we want results on
[01:52:25] this thing, the kind of patient. Because the whole time you're asking that, if I start asking
[01:52:30] you echo, how do we do this, how do we do this, how are we doing right now? You start going,
[01:52:34] well, maybe I'm failing because I'm not getting any results here. If I, you know, I need to give you
[01:52:39] some space and give you some time to let things develop and let you succeed. With us, very few
[01:52:48] reason or understand reason, very few are cool. So again, human nature, if you only, this is important,
[01:52:57] this is very important. If you only use combat methods that require leaders without fear of high
[01:53:04] intelligence, full of good sense and of a spree, you always make mistakes. So you got to plan
[01:53:10] your plan that it suits the, maybe the less superior leader that you might have. Man is always
[01:53:19] man. He does not always possess ability and resolution. The commander must make his choice of methods
[01:53:25] depending on the troops and on himself. Pride generally causes refusal to acknowledge the truth
[01:53:36] that fear of being vanquished is basic in war. In the mass, pride, vanity, in the mass, pride,
[01:53:45] vanity is responsible for this dissimulation. With a tiny number of absolutely fearless men,
[01:53:51] what is responsible is their ignorance of a thing they do not feel. Feel. There is, however,
[01:53:58] no real basis for this and all real tactics are based upon it. Discipline is a part of taxes.
[01:54:04] Tactics is absolutely at the base of tactics as a Roman showed. So discipline is more important than,
[01:54:14] hey, we're just going to be brave. It's not going to work out for you. I'm not going to work out for you.
[01:54:20] Very well. I had a, we were just got to a body and I pulled the officers in to,
[01:54:33] there's actually the radio room where we had radios. I just want to talk to the officers.
[01:54:38] And I said, hey, guys, look, we're going to be a long deployment. It's going to be rough.
[01:54:42] And we got to pay attention to guys that get combat fatigue and it's going to get, you know,
[01:54:48] guys will get scared and it's going to break them down and all that. And one of the junior officers
[01:54:54] was, he said, he literally did not believe me. He was like, that's, he said, that's not going to happen to
[01:55:01] our guys because we had a bunch of, you know, bad ass studs because that's not going to happen to our
[01:55:07] guys. So we don't need, we don't need, we don't need to worry about that. I said, okay, well, I hope you're
[01:55:10] right. And then about two months. You were right about that. And I said, yeah, I know, but you know,
[01:55:16] so let's find out who we got to take care of, get them some rest or whatever or do our best.
[01:55:24] Back to the book. Our infantry no longer has any battle tactics. The initiative of the soldier rules
[01:55:31] the soldiers of the first empire trusted to the moral and passive action of masses. Today,
[01:55:37] the soldiers object to the passive action of masses. They fight as skirmishes or they march back to the
[01:55:43] front as a flock of sheep of which three fourths seek cover and route if the fire is heavy. So you
[01:55:50] think you're going to, we'll just march the front. No, three quarters of your guys are going to not make it.
[01:55:53] Not going to make it to the front. Manuver is possible only with good organization. Otherwise is
[01:55:59] no more effective than the passive mass of rat of rabble in an attack. In ancient combat,
[01:56:06] the soldier was controlled by the leader in engagements. Now that fighting is open, the soldier cannot be
[01:56:12] controlled. Once, often, he cannot even be directed. Constquently, it is necessary to begin action
[01:56:21] at the latest possible moment and to have the immediate commanders understand what is wanted
[01:56:26] and what their objectives are. Descentualized command. Obviously, self esteem is quite
[01:56:35] unquestionably one of the most powerful motives which moves our men. They do not wish to pass
[01:56:40] for cowards in the eyes of our comrades. If they march forward, they want to distinguish themselves.
[01:56:46] After every attack formation, no longer exists. This is because of the inherent disorder of
[01:56:52] every forward march under fire. The bewildered men, evening officers, have no longer the eyes of
[01:56:58] their comrades or of their commander upon them, sustaining them. Self esteem, no longer impels them.
[01:57:06] They do not hold out the least counteroffensive puts them throughout. Just talking about being
[01:57:16] separated and how before we had everyone watching us, no one was watching me. I guess what,
[01:57:21] I'm going to take a little cover over here in this trench. Do you object that no one ever gets
[01:57:32] within 200 meters of the enemy? That a unit attacking from the front never succeeds. So be it.
[01:57:39] Let us attack from the flank. No, this is important. This is important. The combat. No
[01:57:49] prescribed interval will be kept exactly. It will open. It will close following the fluctuations
[01:57:54] of combat. And this is true with any plan. Business plan. It's not going to be what you thought
[01:58:00] it was going to be. It's not going to go as planned. There's going to be fluctuations in what
[01:58:04] you told people to do. They got to be ready for that. You got to be ready for that.
[01:58:12] I love this one. Absolute rules are foolish. Absolute rules are foolish.
[01:58:24] About it. If you find yourself saying never or saying always, you better put a caveat on that.
[01:58:35] Those are too strong. There's no such thing. With this very rare. Actually, I'd say there's no such thing.
[01:58:42] Maybe I could think of an example. But I'm sure there's an exception there to that.
[01:58:46] Yeah, even to the one that I could think of. There's going to be an exception.
[01:58:49] Yeah. This is cool. The infantry square is not a thing of mechanics of mathematical reasons.
[01:58:56] So the infantry square was attacked. They used any here. They'll tell how they formed up.
[01:59:00] Uplatoon in four ranks, two facing the front to the rear. It's flanks guarded by the extreme
[01:59:05] files that face to the flank and conducted supported by non-commissioned officers placed in a fifth
[01:59:11] rank in the interior of the rectangle. Powerful in its competence and fire cannot be dislodged by
[01:59:17] cavalry. So he's talking about this infantry square and why it's such a good tactic. Why?
[01:59:28] Moly reasons. And no others make the soldier in a square, feel himself stronger than wind in the line.
[01:59:36] He feels himself watched from behind and has no one. Where to fly. So you might think like,
[01:59:41] well, they got goods 360 security and that's why it's good or without their, you know, unit that's
[01:59:45] easy to control. What it is is, hey, when I'm in the square, I know someone's got my back. I know someone's
[01:59:49] got my flank. And I know that their people are watching me and counting on me. So we, I got to fight
[01:59:53] hard. That's why the infantry square worked really well. Fire by command presupposes an impossible
[02:00:02] coolness. Had any troops ever possessed it, they would have mode down battalions as one
[02:00:09] most down course, cornstarch. So he's saying, look, this idea that you're just going to tell him
[02:00:13] to get online online coming on shoot. No, they need to have freedom and the only thing that creates
[02:00:18] communist under fire is security. Security, just like a quarter back, what's going to make him calm
[02:00:25] under fires when he has good defensive people keeping the, oh, line, the old line keeping the,
[02:00:32] the, what the defensive line at bay. It's going to keep him cool. I mean, obviously some guys get pretty
[02:00:37] cool under some pressure. Not as cool as they are when they got a good line just holding the line.
[02:00:46] As always, I'm sorry, always, always take draconian measures to prevent
[02:00:51] pillage from commencing. If it begins, it is difficult ever to stop it. So you got to keep
[02:00:57] it get a hold of line. Keep your troops disciplined. Here's a little dichotomy of leadership coming
[02:01:04] at you. A leader must combine resolute bravery and impetuosity with prudence and calmness,
[02:01:13] a difficult matter. That's the dichotomy of leadership. You got to be calm,
[02:01:21] but you got to be brave. You got to be prudent with what you're doing, but you're at the same time.
[02:01:28] You got to be a little bit rationed. Be aggressive. Good times. Okay. He lays out a little information here
[02:01:40] about generals, like being in high command. So when you're, as we're talking about CEOs,
[02:01:47] we're talking about senior leadership. When one occupies a high command, there are many things
[02:01:53] which he does not see. The general and chief, even a division commander can only escape this
[02:02:00] failing by great activity, moved by strict conscientiousness and aided by clairvoyance.
[02:02:07] Do you have to be able to like see? You have to have a clairvoyant skills.
[02:02:11] This failing extends to those about him to his heads of services. So you're the CEO.
[02:02:16] You're not going to know everything that's going on. The only way you do, you do know what's
[02:02:19] going on is by being really proactive and finding out what's going on. And by the way, it's not just you that
[02:02:24] doesn't know all your little, all your other people in the C-suite, they don't know what's going on either.
[02:02:27] You lose a lot of that stuff unless you're super proactive. Now here's some examples. These men live well,
[02:02:34] sleep well. The same must be true of all. They have picked well-conditioned horses. The roads are excellent.
[02:02:42] They are never sick. The doctors must be exaggerating sickness. They have attendance and doctors.
[02:02:47] Everybody must be well-looked after. Something happens which shows a bombadable negligence,
[02:02:54] common enough in the war with a good heart and a full belly they say. But this is infamous,
[02:03:01] unheard of. It could not have happened. It is impossible. So you gotta be careful of that detachment.
[02:03:07] When you get to the senior leadership positions, when you start going out of those guys in the front
[02:03:10] ones, what's wrong with it? What can they possibly be complaining about? You can't be that
[02:03:15] bad about out there. Actually, it can. Now we'll talk about a little micro management.
[02:03:20] Back to the book today, there is a tendency whose cause should be sought on the part of
[02:03:26] superiors to infringe on the authority of the infereers. This is general. It goes very
[02:03:33] high and is further by the mania for command. Right? People don't want to be controlling everything.
[02:03:39] It results in the lessening of the authority of subordinate officers in the minds of their soldiers.
[02:03:47] So when you're micro managing, you're hurting the authority of your subordinate leadership.
[02:03:51] This is a grave matter. As only the firm authority and prestige of subordinate officers can maintain
[02:03:56] discipline. The tendency to oppress subordinates to want to impose upon them in all things,
[02:04:02] the views of the superior, not to admit of honest mistakes. Right? We don't want to make
[02:04:08] mistakes. We want to impose on them all things, the views of the superior, not to admit honest mistakes,
[02:04:15] and to improve them as faults to make everybody even down to the private field that there is only
[02:04:21] one infallible authority. And that's me. A criminal, for instance, sets himself up as the sole authority
[02:04:30] with judgment and intelligence. He thus takes all initiative from subordinate officers and reduces
[02:04:35] them to a state of inertia coming from their lack of confidence in themselves and from fear of being
[02:04:42] severely reproved. How many generals before regimen think of, think only of showing how much they know?
[02:04:51] Don't be that leader. They lessen the authority of the Colonel. That is nothing to them. They have
[02:04:57] asserted their superiority. True or false, that is what is essential. With cheeks puffed out, they leave
[02:05:03] proud of having attacked discipline. Really bothers me. But it's, you know, here we are, 1840. We're
[02:05:14] talking, 1860. We're talking about micromanagement. We're talking about micromanagement. Right?
[02:05:23] We're talking about the operational on, not knowing what's these problems that we deal with with
[02:05:28] businesses all the time in echelon front. This is what we deal with. And it's hard for people to see
[02:05:33] that they're doing this because they don't know it. Even though this is such a common trait
[02:05:39] that we can go back thousands of years and see, people don't recognize it.
[02:05:46] Well, this one bothers me. Ask much in order to attain obtain a little. Is a false saying.
[02:05:52] A source of errors and attack on discipline. One, two obtain what one asks. It is only necessary
[02:06:01] to be moderately reasonable and practical. So this is like, hey, echelon, we need to sell 10,000
[02:06:06] of these new units we've made. And what I'm really hoping is that you sell a thousand. That's not,
[02:06:14] well, that's not a good way to do. If I want you to sell a thousand, that's what I want you to
[02:06:17] make. You know, I want you to make a thousand of these new units. Okay, make a thousand. I don't
[02:06:21] tell you make 10,000 in hope that you can know. I think it's a disaster. Don't do that.
[02:06:28] Man's admiration for the great spectacles of nature is the admiration for force.
[02:06:34] Again, we're getting a little bit of human nature. It's a little touch. In the mountains,
[02:06:38] it is mass a force that impresses him, strikes him, makes him admire. In the calm,
[02:06:43] see it is the mysterious and terrible force that he defines. That he feels in that enormous
[02:06:51] liquid mass in the angry sea force. Again, in the wind and the storm and the vast depths of the
[02:06:57] sky, it is still force that he admires. All these things astounded man when he was young when he
[02:07:04] became old, he knows them. A astonishment has turned to admiration, but always it is the feeling of
[02:07:11] a formidable force which compels his admiration. This explains his admiration for the warrior.
[02:07:18] The warrior is the ideal of primitive man, the savage, the barbarian. The more people rise in moral
[02:07:29] civilization, the lower this ideal falls. But the masses everywhere, the warrior still is and for a
[02:07:37] long time will be the heights of their ideals. This began because man loves to admire force and
[02:07:45] bravery that are his own attributes. When that force and bravery find another means to assert themselves
[02:07:54] at least when the crowd is shown that war does not furnish the best examples of them,
[02:08:00] that there are true and more exalted examples. This ideal will give way to a higher one.
[02:08:07] Don't think it's quite apt yet. The only method of fire to be used in war is fire at will.
[02:08:26] When you're trying to control your teams and their every action, that's the action of a soldier.
[02:08:39] It's the fire. When you're trying to control that you are micro managing. In many cases,
[02:08:46] you let them operate on their own. Now I'm going to close out this piece of battle studies right
[02:08:58] here for going to August 15th, 1870. This is about in the first month of the Franco-Prussian war,
[02:09:07] Colonel DePique was with his regiment. On the outskirts of a town called Mars Latour in France,
[02:09:20] and they started to receive artillery fire and this section or this quote is from the history
[02:09:31] of France's 10th Infantry Regiment. They started taking some shelling and here we go. The Colonel
[02:09:38] had arms taken at once and disposed the regiment north of the road which being elevated provided
[02:09:44] sufficient cover for the men. He himself stood in the road to put heart into his troops by his
[02:09:51] attitude. They having been a little startled by the surprise and the baptism of fire which they
[02:09:57] received under such disadventages circumstances. Suddenly a shell burst over the road, a few feet
[02:10:05] from the Colonel and mutilated his legs in a frightful manner. The shell caused other ravages
[02:10:12] in the ranks of the 10th. The commander of third battalion, Major D'ShaNays, was mortally wounded.
[02:10:20] Captain Ray Bole was killed. Lieutenant Pone, third battalion, first company,
[02:10:25] and eight men of the regiment were wounded. The Colonel was immediately taken to the other side of
[02:10:32] the highway into the midst of the soldiers and a surgeon called those of the regiment already being
[02:10:39] engaged in caring for the other victims of the terrible shot. In the meantime, Colonel D'Pique asked
[02:10:47] for Lieutenant Colonel Dolyak delivered to him his saddlebags containing important papers concerning
[02:10:53] the regiment and gave him his field glasses. Then without uttering the least sound of pain not
[02:11:01] with standing the frightful injury from which he must have suffered horribly, he said with calmness,
[02:11:07] my regret is to be struck this way without having been able to lead my regiment on the enemy.
[02:11:15] They wanted him to take a little brandy. He refused and accepted some water,
[02:11:19] which a soldier offered him. A surgeon finally arrived. The Colonel showing him his right leg
[02:11:27] opened in two places, made with his hand the sign of amputating at his thigh saying,
[02:11:32] Dr. It is necessary to amputate my leg here. At this moment, a soldier wounded in the soldier
[02:11:40] in the shoulder placed near the Colonel, grown to loud. For getting his own condition,
[02:11:46] the Colonel said immediately to the surgeon, see first doctor, what is the matter with this brave
[02:11:51] man? I can wait. Because of the lack of instruments, it was not possible to perform the
[02:11:59] amputation on the ground as the Colonel desired, so this much deplored commander was transported
[02:12:04] to the Met's hospital. Four days later, on the 19th of August, Colonel Arden, D'Pique,
[02:12:14] died like a hero of old, without uttering the least complaint. Far from his regiment,
[02:12:26] far from his family, he uttered several times the words which summed up his affections.
[02:12:32] My wife, my children, my regiment, my wife, my children, my regiment, had your goodbye.
[02:12:48] And so, we see a man who despite his intimate knowledge of the fear and the immense strength
[02:13:18] that the instincts of self-preservation hold yet, he showed no fear. And overcame his own
[02:13:25] instincts of self-preservation. And maybe, maybe that's because he knew them so well.
[02:13:37] He understood them so deeply that he was able to overcome them.
[02:13:50] And maybe of all the incredible lessons we can learn for Colonel, to Pique, perhaps the most
[02:14:00] important one is for us to realize why it is still critical for us to increase our knowledge.
[02:14:08] Not just of war, but of all things. So that we have the knowledge and the understanding
[02:14:20] to confront and overcome those things, the good and the bad. So, learn.
[02:14:37] Learn about your strengths and your weaknesses, learn about strategy and tactics,
[02:14:42] learn about fear and hesitation, learn about human nature. And learn about yourself.
[02:14:55] Test yourself. Find out who you are. Find out where fear and hesitation might cause you
[02:15:10] to back down or fall short. Learn and understand yourself so you can overcome and conquer
[02:15:26] the limitations of your natural instincts and replace them with the will and the discipline
[02:15:36] to overpower and overcome everything in your path.
[02:15:50] And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So,
[02:15:57] I go Charles. Speaking of learning and gaining knowledge,
[02:16:09] maybe you could convey some knowledge on how to support this podcast. Time for support.
[02:16:14] Sure. Of course. I feel like we should start with on it.
[02:16:18] Good places. Don't break the cycle, the routine, the ritual, the fuel. So, on it, best supplements in
[02:16:27] the straight up in the world. You call that, huh? Yeah. Browse is funny. Like I sound kind of sick.
[02:16:34] I was like, talk last week and I'm all talking. You know, you're trying to not be sick. Remember?
[02:16:39] I think you're thinking of getting sick. Yes. Guess what I did.
[02:16:42] Sure. I'm taking you on boom. Or did it? Yeah. You gotta have that stuff on standby. Do you know
[02:16:48] where you can feel when you're getting sick? Yeah. I totally deserved it. Just how actually
[02:16:52] I didn't really say anything bad. But I deserve it. Oh, so you are deep inside. You're looking
[02:16:56] to be a weakness. No. Yeah. Oh, no. I was more like, because I hadn't bought it yet. You know,
[02:17:03] we knew who was there. We were like, sure. I'm not sick. But then again, once you're sick,
[02:17:11] it's kind of too late. You don't kind of, anyway, nonetheless. Lesson learned. Shroom taking
[02:17:15] moon on the way for me. I, by the way, I didn't get sick. I just barely touched on getting sick.
[02:17:22] And I'd be, but, amped up the vitamin C, I amp up the shroom tech immune. That fires you up on
[02:17:27] because it's like a little battle. Yeah. Yeah. It's a battle. It is. The morale was high after that one.
[02:17:32] Yeah. I flanked them. I flanked them with the shroom tech immune. Yeah. Big turn. But yeah. So, to kind of
[02:17:39] go down the list. And I think this is important. People ask me, and not to kind of like,
[02:17:45] how I say, you know, a few people. So, people been asking me, and it's like two people,
[02:17:49] their mom, and then their neighbor, or something, your brother. Yeah. And it's like, all people,
[02:17:55] then it, and I was actually talking to my brother about this because he said that to you. He was like,
[02:17:58] all people been asking me this. And then I was like, teasing a monster. Oh, yeah. Two people asked
[02:18:03] you and you're like, but he was a thing. Let's say three people ask you the exact same question in
[02:18:08] like three days. That's one person today. That's not very much. But if they're asking the same
[02:18:12] question, that's a lot of people asking you. Really? Feels like it. Okay. Anyway, so a lot of people
[02:18:17] have been asking me. People in that question, you know, three of them is on it stuff for real,
[02:18:23] is that for real good, you know, and what do you take? So, here it is. If you didn't already.
[02:18:30] Officially on what do you say on the roster, right on the everyday consumption or whatever. See,
[02:18:40] I have on it total strength and performance. That's not every day. That's only when I do
[02:18:45] met constant work out. Sometimes I'll use it for GJ2. Yeah. Stream tech. He's stream tech. The other day
[02:18:52] for GJ2 reminded me of why I used it before it was good. What did the advantage? I'm not going to tell you.
[02:19:00] Because I didn't notice any. It wasn't the other day. Yeah, it was the other day. Yeah.
[02:19:08] But we didn't really roll hard because you were taking the easy on my rib and I think you
[02:19:11] did. I'd be here. Yeah. But I didn't feel tired. Like it wasn't. It was good. Anyway, so
[02:19:16] soon total performance and strict total strength and performance. Stream tech as needed. That's for like,
[02:19:23] you know, hard output, sustained stuff. GJ2 rounds, met cons. If you're into CrossFit,
[02:19:31] take that stream tech. Get you right through it. Keep you in the in the green. Maybe in the yellow.
[02:19:35] Maybe. And then, acrylic oil. Of course daily daily. Essential. You like the strong bone, right?
[02:19:44] This is for joints. You get these joint. You know, I refer a lot of stuff back to GJ2 because
[02:19:51] GJ2 is like a sustained stream tech. It can mess with you. If you're getting after it,
[02:19:58] five days a week in GJ2, even three sometimes. If you're not used to it, you take the
[02:20:02] acrylic oil. Take your right up. Yeah. Krill oil. I got the gourmet peanut by it's not peanut but
[02:20:14] it's like cash you. I mean, you know, it's a try. Blend butter. No one's good. You like that one? Yeah,
[02:20:20] yeah, it's more as well. And where are your parts? For sure. Where not going trips,
[02:20:24] not a speaking companies or work with companies. A lot of them in their little snack area.
[02:20:28] Yeah, more of your parts. No butterware bars. Then the no. Yeah, it's good. So good though.
[02:20:33] Yeah, what are they going to do? Put down on the other town for me. I'll strain the roof. Yeah. And oh no, no,
[02:20:38] don't. It's, it's, on it is interesting in that way. I don't know how much you browse the website,
[02:20:47] but when I'll go in there, I'll browse it. This is the, like, I'm not going to buy women's
[02:20:53] t-shirts for myself, you know, but I'll just browse this distance. Oh, you're so
[02:21:00] read about the women's. Yeah, well, not, not necessarily women's, but I'm just saying,
[02:21:03] even if I'm not going to work it for some stuff, oh, look. And they have all kinds of new stuff.
[02:21:08] Like, um, you know, obviously protein powder and stuff, but they'll have like wellness stuff
[02:21:12] though, uh, multi-bite, but they have toothpaste. Oh, I didn't know that. Deodorant? Yeah.
[02:21:16] Interesting. I'm not saying get the toothpaste in the other end. I'm just saying it's interesting
[02:21:20] how much new stuff they're always like coming out with. Oh, and I forgot to say the kettlebells
[02:21:25] that they have. All up on those. Primal? Bells? Legend. Bells. Legend. Bells. And then there's zombie bells.
[02:21:32] That's what I think zombie bells. Yeah. Because I want something that looks, you know,
[02:21:36] just stirring and crazy. How much is the, um, or how much does it weigh? What I have the 40k
[02:21:43] to hang the 80 something, Palmo. Yeah. Dang. That's good. I have the wearable one, two wearable
[02:21:50] ones. Those are like 62 pounds. I keep the zombie bell in the house. Oh, it's like aesthetic.
[02:21:56] No, no. Oh, you need jump on it. So I think it's because in my garage, I got bunch of kettlebells,
[02:22:02] but those are all older than on it, right? But in my house, I got the, the boom, the zombie bell.
[02:22:07] Yeah. Because I, where you just hit a couple snatches, you will wake up. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:22:11] Hit a couple snatches, hit a couple swings, you're going to go. Do you do the one where you go?
[02:22:14] Yeah. I'm in hits the back here. Yeah. You got to get used to that. You got to jump into that.
[02:22:19] But yeah, there's some reason you notice it when you first start kettlebells, but you don't notice it after a while.
[02:22:23] Yeah. Just, well, you're not ready for the whole. You know what you know what you do is you use your grip. At least I do.
[02:22:28] I use my grip to like slow it down a little bit. Yeah. There's a little bit of friction there.
[02:22:32] Right. I get down to get a little softer landing on there. Dang. Yeah. That's a good idea.
[02:22:37] So you can use the zombie bells kind of like your, you know, how some guys I think it was you.
[02:22:43] It's telling me you have two gays. You have one gig. You never really use unless it's like picture taking time.
[02:22:48] That's not me.
[02:22:50] That's not me.
[02:22:50] That is called the Hollywood. That wasn't you. The Hollywood gig and the action gig.
[02:22:54] Absolutely not. The Hollywood gig is like, it's, it's a legit gig. Like most gays are.
[02:22:59] You can roll in them, but you do kind of keep it, you know, in the closet, how
[02:23:03] up. When it's easy to roll up, you do know me at all. I thought it was you long time. Maybe you changed.
[02:23:10] I don't know. I didn't change nonetheless. If I feel like he is going to get rolled in.
[02:23:15] Dig it, fed. I did it. Otherwise, why would I have it? Yeah. Oh, that's right.
[02:23:19] Take pictures and no. Next question.
[02:23:22] Whatever. Oh, by the way, Dr. Zinjitsu magazine taking pictures the other day. Yeah. I said it.
[02:23:27] Yeah. Maybe on the cover. Maybe not. I don't know. Anyway, back to on it. We all know
[02:23:34] okay, best supplement in the world. These are all the things. What they do. If you take a supplement
[02:23:37] for something like from on it. You're still doing on it right now. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to continue
[02:23:41] to do on it because it's working. This is valuable information. If I was on the other side of this,
[02:23:47] I wouldn't hope that somebody told me this. Well, that is true. And I think like,
[02:23:51] for instance, Kriloiol, you do not know about Kriloiol. Yeah. And now you know about Kriloiol. Yeah.
[02:23:55] You are sore and getting old and decrepit. Boom. You started taking Kriloiol? Boom.
[02:24:00] Back in the game. Back in the game. Yeah. What's, what's good point? What's bad about taking
[02:24:04] Kriloiol though is I did my wife's dad, my father and I would always recruit Ruloiol's bed
[02:24:08] in the fish oil and be like, whatever health. Not that you don't look to me. I left. Yeah. I got
[02:24:13] a mid to it. Oh, good. Anyway, you know that the supplements you take from on it are going to work.
[02:24:18] That's the good thing. And there's a bunch of cool stuff. Even in goes above and beyond supplements.
[02:24:21] It's like the peanut butter. Yeah. But you said no. There's a lot of stuff. Yeah. I'm just a small reminder.
[02:24:26] Oh, good. If you want 10% off though. Yes, that's it. That's the support part.

[02:24:48] website jokopodcast.com or on the side. Here's the thing too. If you have an ad blocker, it might block
[02:24:54] these little banners there. Which is cool. That's a safe thing to do. You know, you block ads and
[02:24:59] pop ups and whatnot. But know that this will happen most of the time. Most ad blockers. Anyway,
[02:25:07] banner on the side. Good. Jokopodcast.com over on the side is a banner that Amazon clicked through that.
[02:25:11] Then do your shopping. That helps. That supports a lot. Reinforcements. Another way. Subscribe to the podcast.
[02:25:21] On iTunes. On Stitcher. If you haven't already. Do you want to have it said in the well? What review?
[02:25:27] Yeah. Yeah. I got a review on there, man. I'll kick a review on there. Tell him what's up. And
[02:25:31] there's been, hey, there was a review of jokopodt. Yeah. Have you read it? It's the best review of all time.
[02:25:38] Yeah. And it's the basic theme is brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brew. Brewing up the tea again.
[02:25:48] And it goes. Yeah. Yeah. And entire is the best review of all time. Yeah. I saw that.
[02:25:53] I was so that is what I mean, just the best thing about that. When I read that, and of course,
[02:26:00] I get it. But what I love about that is when I read stuff like that, I think about all the people
[02:26:05] that that know nothing about anything that we're doing. And they just read that and say,
[02:26:10] well, what do they think? Yeah. What is it going through their mind? So when everybody puts all these crazy
[02:26:15] reviews on Amazon or on the podcast, I got to admit that I find them entertaining. Yeah. I would
[02:26:24] think if you don't really know and you see just all the, the one thing that person could figure out.
[02:26:31] That's what could they do? Yeah. They do like get after it. There's a lot of people say that.
[02:26:36] They did. They did a lot of stuff that yeah. I read free people out. Yeah. No, but that would
[02:26:43] at least make them think like, there's a lot to this thing. This thing is heavy. This isn't just
[02:26:48] white tea or this isn't, you know, this is heavy. I got to look into that unless they're scared
[02:26:53] or whatever, inhibited or that's not for me, which would be strange. But unless you have
[02:26:58] you're in the mood, right, or review, you know, you're feeling creative, get creative, whatever.
[02:27:03] Good. Yeah. You can get creative on all. You can get creative on it. Because the review is actually
[02:27:07] help. That's the thing. Yeah. You know, you might think it doesn't mean anything, but A, we read them,
[02:27:11] B, it helps. It helps. Like Amazon. It helps the ranking in Amazon. It helps the iTunes ranking for
[02:27:19] sure. So that's cool. It's another good reason to do it. But mostly do it just to crack me up and
[02:27:23] make people think that all of us are psycho. And express yourself. That's a good point too. So
[02:27:29] no, I should read that through. Maybe if we ever do a commercial for Jockel, I think that's a good
[02:27:38] thing. The chorus is there's no TV in the poor. So good. Yeah. That's awesome. All right. Very much.
[02:27:47] So also subscribe on YouTube. We're putting on more videos, you know, which is pretty dope. It's pretty
[02:27:54] dope. Sure. No videos to watch. You know, short. You got some in the hopper too, right? I got a
[02:28:00] feeling of hopper. Yeah. I have like three in the hopper, which is kind of different. Do you think you should
[02:28:04] prioritize an execute? Yeah. Or do you just, do you just like creating three different things at the same
[02:28:09] time? No, because a lot of time in this main may or may not be the most disciplined approach, but
[02:28:15] I like kind of go with the wave. You know, so it's like, oh, man, this one really, like I'm feeling this
[02:28:21] one, you know, so all let's make that one into a video. And I just start and then I'll get hit with
[02:28:25] something else that you said or whatever. But all these artistic things you got going on in your mind.
[02:28:30] Yeah. Actually I do that with books. This is, you know, I read a lot of books. And I will definitely
[02:28:36] read a book. And if it's kind of slow moving, I'll read another book at the same time. And then when I get
[02:28:41] bored, I want to start reading the other one to hop. I can have up to three books going at the same
[02:28:44] time. Yeah. So that's actually not a bad idea. There you go. See, and mine is a lot like, I just
[02:28:50] figure if you reel into it, do it. It comes out like better. I don't know. Yeah. It's what it feels like,
[02:28:55] you know, I'm going to stick with that for right now unless it, you know, produces roadblocks.
[02:28:59] And then, you know, we'll change strategy. But they are coming along videos YouTube subscribe. If you
[02:29:05] haven't already, if you're in the mood to support, you're under no obligation to subscribe to anything
[02:29:11] by the way. Of course. But if you're free. I'm sure. Totally totally. Also,
[02:29:18] Joc was a store called Joc was store. URL Joc was store. We have shirts. If you like T-shirts,
[02:29:25] cool. Multidimensional, multi-layered, philosophically layered T-shirts. Some travel mugs on there.
[02:29:34] The travel mugs. We're still working on it. I was telling you about the other day.
[02:29:38] Which one? I don't know. I was talking about a layer. There's layers and things.
[02:29:42] Oh, this is what it was. The book, way the warrior kid. There's a layer here. Because the illustrator
[02:29:50] for the book, a warrior kid is a guy by the name of John Bozac. John Bozac was my brother growing up.
[02:29:58] My friend growing up. Good friend. One of my best friends growing up. And when we were kids,
[02:30:04] we were in the hardcore bands and we were playing rock and roll music and stuff. And one of the bands
[02:30:10] that we were in was a little band called Bronson's Children. So the layer here is a one day I posted
[02:30:16] a picture of an old silk screen T-shirt for Bronson's Children. Yes. Which I think we should personally
[02:30:23] reproduce. We're going to get after it. Because Charles Bronson was awesome. He was a legit guy.
[02:30:31] He was an actor. We have nowadays that were you. I'm an actor. He was like, oh, I was a
[02:30:38] tailgunner in World War II, barely survived. They came back and got a job making movies about bad
[02:30:44] asses. That's Charles Bronson. By the way, grew up in a coal miner. He was in the mines
[02:30:51] in some steel town in Pennsylvania, barely spoken. Because he was a Polish immigrant. Anyways,
[02:30:56] with an attitude. That's why that book band was named Bronson's Children.
[02:31:00] So the layer here is, interestingly enough, because I don't have a lot of friends, right?
[02:31:06] Never have. But the layer here is the couple for the few friends that I have.
[02:31:11] I'm good friends with. Yeah. And yeah. And so that old Bronson's Children T-shirt silk screen
[02:31:19] was designed by my guy that was in the band with me, whose name is John Bosac, who now has illustrated
[02:31:26] way of the warrior kid. That's some layers. Yeah. Yeah. That's layers. So, cool. Just a good job.
[02:31:34] They're just good. Yeah. It's awesome. But yeah. Layers. Sorry. Layers. Yeah. I hate
[02:31:40] this go back to the store. Real quick. Uh, the, yeah, I'm sure it's whatever they have layers.
[02:31:45] Cool. If you listen, you know these layers. Or you'll pick up on them, which is, you know,
[02:31:49] I guess kind of makes it one. By the way, I have never thought these layers were super deep, right?
[02:31:54] You, you, I think you think the layers are deeper than I think they are. Yeah. I do. The one that I,
[02:32:00] I kind of was a little bit. I liked was the layers on the equal sign on discipline equals freedom.
[02:32:07] And you made it like a barcode, which matches the layers of the font, which is OCR standard,
[02:32:14] which can be read by a computer just like the equal sign. Apparently by the barcode. So I like
[02:32:18] where you're coming from. Yeah. Layers there. Yeah. The, like, which is the standard, the original.
[02:32:23] Well, fun. The first font. You know what we should do is next t-shirt.
[02:32:29] Let me help you put layers in it. Yeah. And then we can not say what the layers are.
[02:32:34] That people report the layers. Yeah. Actually, the good shirt layers apparently are kind of deep,
[02:32:42] because I've got more than one inquiry about this. They're like, hey, did you realize that the word
[02:32:46] good is spelled backwards? It's like, I don't know if that's a mistake. I don't care. It's a cool shirt,
[02:32:52] but spelled backwards. And I was like, yeah, no, man. It's, it's for you. That message is for you telling
[02:32:59] yourself that, but it's kind of joccal saying it. That's what you look at it in the mirror. It's not for
[02:33:03] other people. It's show your cool shirt. Sorry, it is, but that message. Anyway. So you layers. Yeah. I didn't
[02:33:09] think that was too subtle. Oh, man. You don't teach their own certain people seeing, you know,
[02:33:14] for a different, their mind's some were creative. I'm going to come up with a shirt that's got layers.
[02:33:19] It's layers for days. People are going to have to do analytics analysis on the layers on the shirt.
[02:33:26] Yeah, man. Good. Good idea. You have a shirt that's so layered that no one understands what it is.
[02:33:32] Yeah. Something that happens in literature. It's just when I was going to college.
[02:33:35] You've got something that's so many layers. I'd say, you know what? This has so many layers. It's
[02:33:38] not worth it. If you have to break out a microscope to see the layers, why put them in there?
[02:33:44] I know. Four people on plan earth are going to understand the layers you put in this crazy
[02:33:49] poem that you wrote. Why did you do that? Was that good? If only four people can get it? No, it's bad.
[02:33:56] What's bad for our thing? I want the people to blend them getting. I want some people to be
[02:34:01] able to get them. Yeah. I think layers should be a little bit harder to see. Yeah. That's a nice
[02:34:07] thing. Yeah. Yeah, man. Yeah. You don't need to, I guess, you don't need to. For a while, you
[02:34:11] weren't talking about the layers. You thought that was too much. You weren't back. You know,
[02:34:15] I didn't want anyone to go into a layer fatigue or nothing like this. But yeah, they're back.
[02:34:19] Anyway, layers to on the t-shirt. They're good. Well, you know, they're quality shirts. They're not like the
[02:34:24] cheap, you know, I didn't go to Target and buy a bunch of undershirts. And then that, hey, let's
[02:34:30] spray paint them in the garage. No. They're good. They're good. Anyway, chocolate store.com. Some
[02:34:37] hoodies on there. Some patches. Some cool patches. And rash guards. Just take a browse. Don't
[02:34:42] buy anything. I'm not saying go buy something. I'm saying look at it. You like something. You're in the
[02:34:46] mood to support get something. Get something in return. There you go. Also psychological warfare
[02:34:55] is doing well. And when I say doing well, I mean, it's out there like making a difference. That's true.
[02:35:01] And I remember there is actually a half, you know, whatever few weeks ago I said, oh, yeah, I don't
[02:35:06] need any more. Like I got my boost and then, but yeah, I needed it. I went right back to it and boom.
[02:35:11] It's where easy money. Yeah, that's that's the genius. What did you lead for? What's the
[02:35:15] scenario? The work out? The same as always. Like that. I could easily get some projects to finish
[02:35:20] up right now. And so I loved to wake up early in the morning, work out, but I got to prioritize
[02:35:26] next year right now to finish some projects. And so they today, I didn't. I woke up and wrote
[02:35:33] it because I got projects. And it's it's so easy. If you don't work out in the morning,
[02:35:40] it's so easy to not work out. And because by the time I had this, I didn't get where I wanted
[02:35:45] and had something else and then I'm trying to work on this and then the email. So now,
[02:35:48] because I want to do this, I am just going to get a pre-lunch work out 11 o'clock in the morning,
[02:35:53] get in there and get it done. And the fall of the sun, it was 11, 30, all of a sudden, it was 12.
[02:36:00] Also, it was like 12, 10. Get the work out started. And now I'm a little bit hungry. And you know,
[02:36:07] you, you have your little thought of, you know what, maybe I shouldn't work out. But I actually didn't have
[02:36:12] that thought. You know what I said? Cool. I'm tired. I'm fasted. And I don't feel like working out
[02:36:19] so I'm definitely going to work out right now. And we're making a good one. So that's what I did.
[02:36:23] Well, yeah, but not everybody's like that. Well, no, and like the voice that's in psychological
[02:36:27] warfare, I actually have to live with that. Yeah. Exactly. You know what? Yeah. There's no like,
[02:36:32] it doesn't, I never, it never presses pause. It never stops. It's always in there telling me,
[02:36:37] get to the gym. You don't want to work out good, get in there and crush yourself. I have to live with
[02:36:43] that guy. So yeah, that's good. Which really is the originating story of psychological warfare.
[02:36:49] So if you don't know, psychological warfare is a album with tracks that you can purchase from one
[02:36:55] of the music. There's no music. Correct. Do you think it should I had music?
[02:36:59] Yeah. Well, okay. Maybe. But the problem is there's too many different types of music. Yeah.
[02:37:06] And it wouldn't have the same effect. I don't think. That's true. So I agree with you. Yeah.
[02:37:11] So because otherwise, I would have said, he put some little instrumental, whatever. Well,
[02:37:16] here's something like if there's music on certain things, like you like to listen to certain,
[02:37:21] like, you know, you hear a speech. I don't know. Martin Luther King or somebody saying like a
[02:37:25] speech and one, they want to get inspired. Yeah. It'll work for sure. But that's not really what
[02:37:29] this is in that specific way. It's more like you actually talking. You know, it's good point. It's like
[02:37:36] you're part of like, you know, when you see a like the movie, no country for old men. Yeah. I don't know
[02:37:41] if you see that movie. There's just that there's no soundtrack. Yeah. It's just the actual sounds of earth
[02:37:47] and people and walking. And that is such a cool effect. So I think you're right in this case.
[02:37:52] Yeah. No country for old men. By the way, written by Kornback McCarthy, who also wrote
[02:37:58] Blood Meridian. Yeah. Layers by the way. Layers all over. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's it. That's
[02:38:08] it's like a lot of work. Oh, I didn't finish it clean what it is. So it's an album you can get iTunes,
[02:38:12] Amazon Music, whichever. And they're basically you listen to it. If you're ever feeling a moment of
[02:38:18] weakness before you want to go, you know, work out before you want to do something or not do something.
[02:38:23] Or yes, yeah, if you're making a decision and you're choosing the short term payoff over the long term
[02:38:27] payoff essentially. No not eating doughnuts or just messing up your diet with doughnuts or sugar stuff or
[02:38:34] doughnuts. Skinny. What was going to airborne school? There was a sergeant major and he was some
[02:38:41] black guy from Georgia. Yeah. And for some reason there's the chatoo, you rivered down there. Yeah. And he says,
[02:38:49] me tell you what, you go down in the chatoo, you river. So he's talking about if you're parachuting and you
[02:38:54] end up in the chatoo, you better watch out the snakes in the chatoo, and his alagators in the chatoo,
[02:39:01] which he and snakes and vines and a wrap you up and snakes snakes in the chatoo. I was thought,
[02:39:09] you know what? It's keep clear of the chatoo, because there's snakes in there. Right. You know,
[02:39:14] so is that kind of what you're trying to replicate there with this psychological warfare? No,
[02:39:19] I forget what I just did, but it led me into that story. Yeah, that was a good story.
[02:39:24] So the chatoo, who do you river? You know, you gotta beware for sure. Beware the sugar coated
[02:39:28] ice. I don't know. By the way, you're impression of what was his name? I have no idea. He was
[02:39:33] it was so he was what's called a back hat at Army Airborne School back in the early, the
[02:39:39] Navy used to only go to the Army Airborne School. So you get done with seal training and you're on
[02:39:45] good shape and feeling and then you show up at Airborne School, which is a much, it's a less
[02:39:50] strenuous school, the seal training. I mean, you're not special operation if you go there. I mean,
[02:39:56] any pretty much anyone in the Army or many, very many people in the Army. So it's a three week
[02:40:01] school to good school. I mean, obviously the biggest thing you gotta overcome there is not
[02:40:04] physical. It's the fear of heights or whatever fear of jumping. But yeah, so you go down there
[02:40:08] in the black hats or the guys that run Airborne School. It's a totally professional thing. There's
[02:40:11] a lot of fun and that that sergeant major though. He was awesome. He was here at the crazy eyes.
[02:40:16] You know what I mean? Sure. That's what crazy ass is. We had the one other thing he said to me one
[02:40:20] day because he liked me. You know why he liked me? Because I was getting after him. Yeah. And he said to me,
[02:40:25] he goes, hey, and I don't think he, I think he'd call me like Navy. Yeah, it's really
[02:40:29] common. He just called me Navy, right? Because they don't know what our ranks are. So he's
[02:40:33] called me Navy. He's like, hey, Navy. I said, I was like, I think he said clear. For some reason he's
[02:40:39] a clear sergeant major or something. And I'll clear sergeant major. And he goes, maybe day or
[02:40:44] some. When you get back to your CEO team one day, I want you to come over to J. Sock.
[02:40:52] And we'll have fun killing motherfuckers. Now, what do you think? I was I was like 19 years old.
[02:40:59] I am so. Wherever you go, the sergeant major, I'm with you. I'm in the game.
[02:41:07] So yeah, that was a sergeant major black hat down at Airborne School. You kind of sound like a
[02:41:13] Taj Mahal, the singer. That's who he is. That is. He's a blue singer of a hand. Actually,
[02:41:19] we're with his family. I'm cool. He's a traveling guy. But yeah, he's a blue singer. He's a blue singer.
[02:41:24] Okay, but he's from Hawaii. He's going to be out from Hawaii. But he doesn't really get a lot of
[02:41:29] blues when you live in Hawaii. I think you'd be surprised. He saw my camera little imitation there.
[02:41:34] It's good. We're going to kill him motherfuckers. He cares the dust. Anyway, there it is.
[02:41:42] Psychological warfare sounds more like Jocca, not the Taj Mahal. And he tells you, he
[02:41:51] convinces you that making the long-term decision to stick with the discipline path. He gives you
[02:41:57] that boost in your head. So it's like, yeah, that's good. Anyway, check that one out. You want to get one of
[02:42:02] those or all of the just album's goods. Bind number one. Straight up number one. Straight up number one.
[02:42:07] Day one. Day one. So everyone that's going to be the first to get up. Thank you for that's a good way to
[02:42:12] support podcast. So yeah, because it costs 99 to buy the album. Yeah, the whole thing. Just like for
[02:42:18] any, you know what? We were like, oh, so how do we do this? Hey, it's 99. Boom. Done. Yeah.
[02:42:26] You can get it and you're supporting the podcast. So that's cool. Also, you know, nothing you can
[02:42:31] get in this Jocca, like, tea. You can get it. It's in stock, by the way. And it's going to stay in stock.
[02:42:36] I'm a little nervous about saying that, but it's going to stay in stock because you know what? I'm
[02:42:40] confident saying that because I bought a lot of it. Because I don't play around when I make a
[02:42:45] logistical error and we end up with no Jocca, like, tea and everyone's angry about that myself included.
[02:42:51] Guess what? We're going to do something about it. So we have stock. We got a lot of stock and you
[02:42:57] would actually know that you need it because deadlifting, you know you need that 8,000 pound increase,
[02:43:07] which by the way is guaranteed. It's guaranteed to happen. We're hearing about pull ups now, too.
[02:43:14] People that are trying to get better at pull ups are going from 10 to 12 pull ups. Now we're getting
[02:43:18] numbers up around 147, made a moment. And the other thing is the Jiu-Jitsu, if you're training the
[02:43:25] Jiu-Jitsu, and we're probably going to have to add a warning to the label of Jocca, white tea,
[02:43:32] because we got people out there that are just randomly throwing commeros. They can't stop it.
[02:43:35] They're meeting somebody boom, they're throwing a commero on them. Just on the regular,
[02:43:39] just landing commeros all over the place. So you got to watch out for that little warning.
[02:43:43] It's on Amazon. That's if you're here in America, if you're on international orders, go to eBay
[02:43:49] and get it from the official listing of the Jockel podcast. It's sold by pro-resourcing,
[02:43:56] which is actually going to change in the near future because we're getting more involved in the actual
[02:44:02] what's that called fulfillment of the tea. We're joining some for a streamlining. Yes. Yes.
[02:44:08] While your on Amazon also, there's a book called Extreme Ownership, referred to it a
[02:44:15] couple of times tonight, possibly by me and my brother, Lave Babin. And let me tell you what you do
[02:44:22] is you lead within your company or within your team. You infiltrate with extreme ownership.
[02:44:32] Get a copy for your subordinates. Get one for your bosses. Spread the word because it will,
[02:44:40] it will actually improve your alignment and your effectiveness as a team. It will.
[02:44:44] And one thing I noticed, I was at a company that we were working with. And it's very impactful.
[02:44:49] Just when people read the book, all of a sudden, they have a common language. They're referring to
[02:44:53] the problems in the same way. They recognize the problems clearly because they've seen it and they all
[02:44:58] understand it and it improves the communication and the understanding between the groups because they
[02:45:04] know what the problems are because they've been identified in the book. So make that happen.
[02:45:09] And also, you can get a little copy of a book pre-order. It's called Way of the Warrior Kid.
[02:45:18] And you might be thinking, oh, I'm not a kid. I'm going to don't.
[02:45:22] Doesn't matter. You actually need this book too. So there's a part in the book.
[02:45:30] When Uncle Jake is trying to explain to his young nephew Mark what discipline is and why it is
[02:45:37] important and that it starts. Discipline starts by getting up early in the morning. And of course,
[02:45:45] Mark, he just thinks discipline is sort of like following the rules. So Uncle Jake has to do a
[02:45:49] little explain into him and this is what Uncle Jake says. That's one kind of discipline.
[02:45:55] But it isn't as simple as just following the rules. People give you the most important part of
[02:46:01] discipline is following rules. You set for yourself. It is doing things. You might not always feel like
[02:46:08] doing things that make you better. Then Uncle Jake started getting really intense.
[02:46:15] Listen, if you want freedom from being bullied at school by Kenny, you have to have the
[02:46:21] discipline to go to justice to class and learn the skills to defeat him. If you want freedom from
[02:46:26] ridicule when you do pull-ups at school, you have to have the discipline to train so that you can
[02:46:31] do pull-ups. If you want freedom to swim in the water and enjoy your school field trip,
[02:46:38] you need the discipline to overcome your fear of the water and learn how to swim.
[02:46:42] What about school? Do you want to be free of being stumped on tests and not knowing the answers
[02:46:49] to the questions they ask you? Then you need the discipline to study and learn the material they teach you.
[02:46:57] When you get older, you're going to want financial freedom. That means having enough money to
[02:47:04] do what you want without worrying about it and the only way you're going to get financial freedom
[02:47:10] is by having financial discipline, by saving money and not wasting it on things you don't need.
[02:47:16] That discipline starts with getting up early in the morning.
[02:47:23] That's a little hit from my Uncle Jake right there.
[02:47:26] So Uncle Jake is, he's clearly mentoring and helping his young nephew Mark, who's got some
[02:47:34] shortfalls that he needs to correct and Uncle Jake helps and do that. So all kinds of lessons
[02:47:41] to be learned in there for all of us and you know lessons about how to study, how to overcome fear,
[02:47:49] how to get stronger. So order yourself a copy and do it now. This is the thing. We want to do it
[02:47:55] now again, I pointed this out before. We want the publisher to print enough so that there's not a shortage.
[02:47:59] Right. If everybody waits, then the printer goes, oh, Greg, you need to know. That's when he
[02:48:03] copies. And then everyone orders it when it comes out and now we have a backup and everyone's angry.
[02:48:09] So order it now that way we have enough when it rolls out and get one, you know, get one
[02:48:15] free the kids at school with classroom, library down the street, get the word out there. I wish
[02:48:21] I wish I had this book when I was a kid. I wish I had this book when I was a kid. So it actually
[02:48:31] comes out May 2nd and then by the way two days later after May 2nd after this book comes out,
[02:48:36] it's going to be time for the extreme ownership. Master number 002 in New York City,
[02:48:42] May 4th and 5th, Maria Markey in New York City, we're finalizing all the details right now and
[02:48:48] I'm telling you what, it's going to be awesome. We're going to get after it and it's going to leave a mark.
[02:48:55] It will have an impact on you. It's intense. It's going to be powerful. And the other cool things
[02:49:01] you're surrounded by all these other people that are all in the game out there crushing it.
[02:49:07] Every imaginable industry, every level of leadership, just getting after it. So sign up, book your
[02:49:16] ticket, get your hotel room. And by the way, I mean, obviously, Wave is going to be there. I will be there.
[02:49:22] So will JP to now. Of course, Echo Charles is going to be rolling around cruising as he likes to say.
[02:49:32] Dave Burke, who's now new to Ashland Front team. JP has been on Ashland Front team for a little bit.
[02:49:39] You know, basically came on the podcast and we said, you know what, we got to get you in the game.
[02:49:42] So JP is in the game, obviously. And Dave Burke, just coming on right now, done a couple of
[02:49:51] work with a couple of companies so far. Wasn't a Marine Corps fighter pilot, top gun,
[02:49:57] top gun instructor, by the way. And also was with us with Task Interpruser as the angle
[02:50:04] co-team leader in the Battle of Ramani. So awesome guy. He's going to be coming on the podcast.
[02:50:09] You're sure soon. I'm so so can't wait for that. And I'll also tell you, we will be hanging out with you
[02:50:19] talking, discussing things overcoming problems. There's no backstage, no green room.
[02:50:26] I'm not that guy. No, none of that. No curtain behind, tied behind just us, all of us. All these
[02:50:34] guys I'm talking about, including echo Charles. We brought echo Charles up on stage last time.
[02:50:40] Do you even like that? No. He doesn't like public speaking. I think you need to give a speech,
[02:50:44] like a five minute speech about something. No, okay. So come on out, do that. And until the
[02:50:52] mustard until we do get there in the meantime, you know that you can find us on the interwebs.
[02:50:59] On Twitter, on Instagram. And even you want to find us right there on that face of
[02:51:09] bulky boha. We are there. And we are interacting on the interwebs. Echo is at echo Charles.
[02:51:19] And I am at Jocka Willink and to close this out to the warriors out there in the world,
[02:51:25] giving us freedom and protecting this country. A country by the way where we can say whatever we
[02:51:32] want, where we are blessed with unprecedented freedoms in thought and speech.
[02:51:42] Thanks to all you servicemen and service women out there in the world, holding the line right now,
[02:51:49] protecting those freedoms and keeping evil at bay. And the police and law enforcement that do the
[02:51:56] same for us here at home. Keep us safe from evil. Thank you for putting on your vest every day
[02:52:07] into the firefighters and the EMTs that are standing by 24 hours a day. Think about that 24 hours
[02:52:15] a day to come and help us. And of course, we never say thank you or we never even see them until
[02:52:25] some unforeseen horror comes and that's when you're there for us. So thank you for your vigilance
[02:52:33] and to everyone else listening to this podcast. Thanks for going down this path with us, this path
[02:52:43] of learning and gaining knowledge and trying to get a better understanding of the world and trying
[02:52:51] to get a better understanding of ourselves. So we can all recognize and overcome our weaknesses and
[02:53:03] our faults and we can all get out there and get after it. So until next time this is echo
[02:53:18] and jacco out.
