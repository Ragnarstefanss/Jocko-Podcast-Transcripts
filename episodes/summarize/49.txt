I hear that a lot that when you know especially when when I first got into reading I Well more so than hear it I kind of think about that where I could be like hey, you know if I come across Situation where I'm gonna apply some knowledge that I learned and if I'm in a situation where I got to Come day the the merits of that knowledge, you know It does feel weird to be like hey the book said it this way and more like you're just this like blind Exactly right so you can you know you can Look at them for like shoulders time like three to I don't know eight minutes or something or if you know if you know someone who's like Hey, you were asking me this question remember You send them that bowl advice like shareable advice kind of thing Anyway, that's like what you're doing there. You know that you need to practice No man in this not to mention just all that like input they like just firing it, you know like on movies They got to be like one hand, you know whatever boom boom A more accurate representation of how we would go is like you know the kind of movies where the girl They they totally do mean women a lot of times when they the girl grabs the gun Yeah, because you guys both know the drilling part of it, you know, but Those you know is the one million different other elements in light like surfing you know like you know when you first take surfing They're like hey, you know, let's do it on the sand when there's and there's it's just that's basically drilling Oh, and they get after it like they like Ali will be Like if someone's from I forget where but it was like Dale King was one of them or show right like gocubs or you know Like if you that's your if you're in Chicago or something should be like gocubs and Show right in a personal message. like Okay, do the armor you know do the whole transition to the arm bar and then you know just drill that when you first learn the arm bar It's gonna have more value because you have to just know the fundamental movement of the arm bar Just like how you said like it's gonna be different when you do it life. That's kind of like a Like Data it's like you got to remember that you know because you know all like you're on two different pages You know, Yeah, like yeah, because she's like you kind of feel like you know the person You know because really when you think about it it's like You know, I'll be we'll use it like I got a go, but you know Yeah, that's good and you know these questions what I liked about him is he's saying hey, you know Basically put the extreme ownership attitude into the UFC cage and let's see how it does and Yeah, that that point you made where I think it's probably just had it really a little bit when you treat your wife like a team guy, you know like how cuz That's how you used it like bonding with people you like and also in a way. I don't know then you got to go out to the actual ways and then the waves That's you know, it's different and again these principles from GJ2 are they applied to everything that you do it and when you're going through a leadership situation If you've seen it before if you've seen this kind of person's added like I just told that story about hey, it's the guy that's learned something The first way he learned it in the seal teams is the way he believed it show is big One side experience that it was much easier for me to handle you know, so anytime you can open up your mind and pay attention on what's going on around you And he grabbed that thing like he was picking up a like he was picking up a A pair of socks it was like no factor boom walked over picked up the snake whacked it against the tree I said okay, that knows how to deal with snakes and it's the same thing here people are snakes Does that mean you just avoid them and you're not gonna play the game and the worst thing You know what you don't do with the snake? I don't think they really do but the adrenaline rush takes Experience to manage What's a good what's a good approach on you know on the mat to let them know that they're being reckless and wasting energy without sounding like a douche All right, so question one the ratio of drilling to sparring I'm probably not the best person to ask this question because I like to roll nobody's the best person asked that question Maybe That's what I do control them put them you know Force them to accept their fate and that will help them move down the path towards relaxation now if you're a lower-bout You can either Fight to the death which is fine I mean kind of join in their mayhem and if you want to do that that's okay, or you can work your technique right and get dominated so so Guy comes in and you know you talk about the same level, but he's a lot stronger than you He's going crazy and you just go okay, you know I'm just gonna work my technique the best of my yeah, the point is like What you would think is a common Charlie horse like with your friend or at school Whatever like oh like an elbow where you punch it or even you need it or whatever Is different than like the kind of Charlie horse that will be effective in They're good check to Zad if you like I'm quite support that like I want to know Keep yourself kind of warm or like it you know as far as when you work out It's tough or just wearing them We watched the fights and the guys were in this specific position You know standing kind of from the back there and he and he asked He's like hey Couldn't he just like throw knees and give him like the meanest Charlie horse right there and then agree like It's not we'll say it's not condescending or anything Yeah, they just like there's so there's so there's they've been in that situation so many times Yeah, they've been in that situation so many times that it doesn't matter They you're doing something they already thought of that they've done they've been in that position Like there's a position in GJ2 for those either don't know there's a position in GJ2 called a 50 50 Which we originally called Cochoreco, which Dean kind of I would say started because He did it in ADCC in 2003 and it was a position that we were doing all the time at that time But no one else was doing it and now a bunch of people do it Ryan Hall's made it famous and he's the one I think he Going out and who going to phrase 50 50 I'm like, yeah, that sounds so easy, but you know I realize it's one like I care about the person and they'd be passive aggressive like or if I care about like their opinion I say that you had to offend them No, no, no, no, it's not not in that way. That's nothing this is nothing new where I think I need a job, you know, dang there's no job that here or whatever and that's kind of an example of that, you know where Don't look at it like a job needs to be presented to you, you know, you have to kind of you need to maneuver Yeah, and I said hey, man, you know I don't know you don't tell you just you know normally when you roll you feel like You know about this level if you're And I'm just completely speaking just from experience and thinking of it right now, but There are little things that you'll see come forward like little tactics You can use to someone who's just bigger stronger and spasin little tactics And not to say that you'll like you know end up tapping them out or whatever, but certain things that will be successful in your Situation so all you do is you kind of remember those things kind of work on that and wait to you see the next little thing Not in the way where like I might offend them, but Like if like you care about what they think, you know, okay, and they're like what's wrong with that? So now we have a good thing going So that's that's what I'm gonna keep my ownership internal I'm not gonna project it on you to keep it internal Now where this flips is the project fails and clearly the example now becomes crystal clear because now if I use External ownership and I'm saying I should use external ownership and when the boss says hey jocco your team failed on this mission I'll say you know what we did I made some mistakes here here's what I did wrong here's we made the wrong investments I didn't allocate resources well here my fault we're gonna get it fixed next time around won't happen Hmm, okay, that's cool. I'm put one today They're like little bite size like bits, you know because sometimes you don't want to listen to the two hours especially on YouTube You just want to listen how do I like like recover from setbacks at work? I mean I mean I did it though that like tradition if let's just say if there is like A person who's like hey, you know like a Yeah, sure, too So if it's like with the introduction of new facts and stuff like that and they're like, okay, I didn't know all that now You know it paints a broader right I think Right, I think yeah, especially passive aggressive like that can be tough because a lot of times it's way easier If I like if I if I launch a confrontation against you, it's way easier mentally to be like you know, more after your pictures so now I feel this way We're starting to feel this way about but there's a there's a bias You know talk about how to advice called it's called a I think it's called backfire effect and it's the opposite so like new factual informational come in and The tendency is to be like is to dig deeper into your current belief. Yeah, that's a good point That's a good thing to think about all day every day about everything Especially you know people who are agree who are like hey, man, I need a job and that's you know I'm in Yeah, and boom there you go Good a couple other things Jockel white tea if you want to get some of that it's probably probably gonna be the only beverage ever gonna want to drink I think that there's a time coming in the very near future where when you go to a bar or to a club out at night I have a good time I think in the future the only thing that they're gonna be selling in the bar in the club in the restaurant But what I'm doing is kind of playing a long-term game on playing some seeds and whatnot trying to get her Maybe to think about how she could help some other folks out there so you know we're trying to work through There is some flanking activity going on We're gonna see where it goes but this question Being married to a guy that's in special operations or in the sealed teams or whatever It is a hard life in many ways and You know the sealed teams we had a 90% divorce rate by the way a 90 You You need to be self-sufficient and and that's not just self-sufficient with You know being able to Clear the toilet when it gets clogged up and you know call the plumber when the Water heater breaks and handle all that administrative stuff and all the tasks around the house and provide you know Take care of the finances because your your husband's gonna be gone He's gonna be gone. It's like a small thing like where if I can Remembrance do this, you know because You're the kind of word like you to defend a certain thing you got to focus really hard and defending it You know like you know how like if you're friendly Charlie Really know Yeah, the is there you know how like some you know people who change their Attitude on things all the time sometimes get frowned upon this is just in general for being like a flip flapper oh, I know how big they are because they're sure it's like I know where they live, you know kind of thing. But kind of the light at the end of the tunnel like you know like you know that's where I'm going This is just part of the thing. so it's kind of the same situation with those YouTube Like like sides videos or you can just revisit the subject matter You know, I mean like if you listen to it, let me go read Yeah That's right, you know pre UFC martial arts if you learn that you know if I touch your neck in this particular Man or you're gonna fall down and nothing is gonna save you from that and if you get taught that You might believe it that's another thing if you got if you've got your your wife or your husband is saying hey, you know you're working out all the time You know, I don't like this say hey, here's the benefits. I get you know the thread back and the guy come back and said something along the lines of like You know I don't know what it is you don't agree with with stoicism. I'm doing my thing You know on top of that I think it's cool if you want to set some goals, you know together Make a little team, you know you're trying to make some things happen.
