00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.64
This is Jocco podcast number 73.

2
00:00:04.64 --> 00:00:09.08
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick.

3
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:10.08
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:12.36
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.36 --> 00:00:19.44
It has been quite a few episodes since we did some Q&A.

6
00:00:19.44 --> 00:00:24.52
You'll answer some questions from the interwebs.

7
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:32.80
We had a series of guests, hate a couple books, and just kind of slid a little bit on Q&A.

8
00:00:32.80 --> 00:00:35.64
So, Q&A.

9
00:00:35.64 --> 00:00:37.64
Yeah.

10
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:41.24
Let's rock.

11
00:00:41.24 --> 00:00:43.84
Let's question number one.

12
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:44.84
Question number one.

13
00:00:44.84 --> 00:00:45.84
Yeah.

14
00:00:45.84 --> 00:00:46.84
Boom.

15
00:00:46.84 --> 00:00:47.84
Question number one.

16
00:00:47.84 --> 00:00:48.84
Jocco.

17
00:00:48.84 --> 00:00:54.20
Do you have to make a conscious effort not to overreact the situations, or is it natural

18
00:00:54.20 --> 00:00:57.32
slash ingrained now?

19
00:00:57.32 --> 00:01:03.20
I would say at this point, it's fairly ingrained, and I don't overreact to a lot of stuff anymore.

20
00:01:03.20 --> 00:01:05.24
In fact, some of them, I just don't react to stuff.

21
00:01:05.24 --> 00:01:06.24
Yeah.

22
00:01:06.24 --> 00:01:07.52
The honest with you, things are going on.

23
00:01:07.52 --> 00:01:12.08
I'll just be sort of, okay, yep, not the head.

24
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:18.28
Listen to what's happening, listen to the people freaking out, and I don't overreact to a lot

25
00:01:18.28 --> 00:01:19.44
of stuff.

26
00:01:19.44 --> 00:01:22.52
That's, I think it's pretty ingrained right now.

27
00:01:22.52 --> 00:01:28.92
And I would say that in order to get there, you know, in order to try and move in that direction,

28
00:01:28.92 --> 00:01:30.92
because that is the best way to be.

29
00:01:30.92 --> 00:01:32.48
Again, I'm not saying to be a robot.

30
00:01:32.48 --> 00:01:35.96
I'm not saying you should have no emotions, and you should never show any.

31
00:01:35.96 --> 00:01:37.48
I'm not saying that.

32
00:01:37.48 --> 00:01:41.44
But you shouldn't, you should have some control over those emotions, especially from a

33
00:01:41.44 --> 00:01:42.44
leadership perspective, right?

34
00:01:42.44 --> 00:01:43.44
That's what I'm talking about.

35
00:01:43.44 --> 00:01:44.92
You're from a leadership perspective.

36
00:01:44.92 --> 00:01:51.72
So, one of the things that you can do is when you, when chaos starts to hit, you know,

37
00:01:51.72 --> 00:01:54.92
make sure that, what does this look like from the outside?

38
00:01:54.92 --> 00:01:58.04
What do I look like from the outside?

39
00:01:58.04 --> 00:02:02.76
When somebody says something to you that's traumatic or is going to cause a disturbance,

40
00:02:02.76 --> 00:02:05.96
or it's going to cause problems, immediately think you're something, okay, what am I going

41
00:02:05.96 --> 00:02:07.16
to look like from the outside right now?

42
00:02:07.16 --> 00:02:10.36
What am I going to look like to them if they're recording this?

43
00:02:10.36 --> 00:02:11.36
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:11.36 --> 00:02:13.96
In your head, like they're recording this, and we're going to go sit down and watch it later

45
00:02:13.96 --> 00:02:18.52
when they first came out with in the SEAL teams, and we started recording people as they

46
00:02:18.52 --> 00:02:25.24
enter rooms, and as we did, primarily close quarters combat scenarios, so you've got guys

47
00:02:25.24 --> 00:02:29.36
and tight quarters, and they're making very quick decisions.

48
00:02:29.36 --> 00:02:32.96
And you start singing what you look like.

49
00:02:32.96 --> 00:02:33.96
And it makes you better.

50
00:02:33.96 --> 00:02:36.04
You know, that's why that's one of the reasons why you do it.

51
00:02:36.04 --> 00:02:41.000
The same thing with you, Jitu, you've watched the tape or MMA, you watched the tape of what

52
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.08
someone's doing, if a ball, they do that in every sport, right?

53
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:47.40
They watch the tape, see what you look like, see what mistakes you made.

54
00:02:47.40 --> 00:02:53.96
So when someone hits you with something, that's disturbing or is going to cause problems,

55
00:02:53.96 --> 00:02:57.96
picture that you're being recorded, and you're going to have to watch the play by play

56
00:02:57.96 --> 00:03:03.72
later with your team and look at what, how much you lost your temper, how much you've

57
00:03:03.72 --> 00:03:06.84
got frazzled, and what a disaster you were.

58
00:03:06.84 --> 00:03:13.20
So that's what I would picture, or as you start to move in the direction of, hey, I'm not

59
00:03:13.20 --> 00:03:19.20
going to get frazzled by problems. I'm just going to listen. I'm going to assess, I'm going

60
00:03:19.20 --> 00:03:21.000
to make decisions, and move forward.

61
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah.

62
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Pretty easy.

63
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Pretty simple.

64
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Thank you.

65
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.64
That play when they say, play, let's go to the video tape.

66
00:03:29.64 --> 00:03:35.40
You know, let's play and we're in football, man, in meetings, they, you know, big screen,

67
00:03:35.40 --> 00:03:36.40
projector, get echo.

68
00:03:36.40 --> 00:03:37.40
The little laser pointer.

69
00:03:37.40 --> 00:03:38.40
Yes, exactly.

70
00:03:38.40 --> 00:03:42.20
So when men, when you mess up, and everyone's looking, what are you doing here?

71
00:03:42.20 --> 00:03:47.08
They pause it, and it shows you, like, mid mess up, you know, man, it's like, they

72
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:50.84
put you on the stage and just throw tomatoes at you.

73
00:03:50.84 --> 00:03:51.84
That's what it feels like.

74
00:03:51.84 --> 00:03:52.84
Yeah.

75
00:03:52.84 --> 00:03:53.84
That's how you get better though.

76
00:03:53.84 --> 00:03:55.44
Yeah, a great, totally agree.

77
00:03:55.44 --> 00:04:00.68
And in a way, I told you I used to do this where it had to do with more like getting

78
00:04:00.68 --> 00:04:05.88
mad, like if I find myself getting mad, you know, something overreaction kind of where

79
00:04:05.88 --> 00:04:10.60
I'd really shame myself, kind of like, man, that's embarrassing.

80
00:04:10.60 --> 00:04:12.64
You got mad, kind of thing.

81
00:04:12.64 --> 00:04:18.28
So it would be on my mind the whole time where any time I fell myself getting mad, it'd

82
00:04:18.28 --> 00:04:19.28
be on my mind.

83
00:04:19.28 --> 00:04:20.28
Like, oh, look at me.

84
00:04:20.28 --> 00:04:22.08
I'm being one of those guys.

85
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:24.48
So it's kind of the same thing, but it's in your own head kind of thing.

86
00:04:24.48 --> 00:04:28.000
Yeah, and it's really boils down to something I talk about all the time, detachment.

87
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Yeah.

88
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's what I'm talking about.

89
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Being able to picture yourself.

90
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.60
What do I look like right now?

91
00:04:32.60 --> 00:04:36.68
Am I appearing to be a panic, stricken, loser?

92
00:04:36.68 --> 00:04:37.68
Yes.

93
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:41.72
I come cool, collected, leader that's going to step up, make a good decision, assess the

94
00:04:41.72 --> 00:04:43.48
situation and move forward.

95
00:04:43.48 --> 00:04:44.48
Yeah.

96
00:04:44.48 --> 00:04:45.48
Let's look like that guy.

97
00:04:45.48 --> 00:04:47.68
The winner, the leader.

98
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:52.76
What about if you're like, what about if you're tired, like you didn't get it a

99
00:04:52.76 --> 00:04:55.40
lot of sleep for a few years right now?

100
00:04:55.40 --> 00:04:56.40
Yeah, no factor.

101
00:04:56.40 --> 00:04:57.40
No, okay, no.

102
00:04:57.40 --> 00:04:58.40
No, no.

103
00:04:58.40 --> 00:04:59.40
You know, people get irritable.

104
00:04:59.40 --> 00:05:00.40
People get irritable.

105
00:05:00.40 --> 00:05:01.40
Yeah, get tired.

106
00:05:01.40 --> 00:05:03.60
Which I actually find amusing.

107
00:05:03.60 --> 00:05:04.60
Yeah.

108
00:05:04.60 --> 00:05:05.60
But that's a real thing.

109
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:06.60
Yeah, it is a real thing.

110
00:05:06.60 --> 00:05:08.68
So you know what that means, you need to feed you.

111
00:05:08.68 --> 00:05:10.72
If you're one of those people, that's going to be in that mode.

112
00:05:10.72 --> 00:05:15.44
You need to be aware of that and you need to focus even more on not overreacting, and

113
00:05:15.44 --> 00:05:16.84
acting like a baby because you're tired.

114
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:18.12
Like a big yeah, exactly.

115
00:05:18.12 --> 00:05:19.48
That's a good way of like a baby.

116
00:05:19.48 --> 00:05:20.48
Yeah, like a baby.

117
00:05:20.48 --> 00:05:21.48
Yeah.

118
00:05:21.48 --> 00:05:22.48
What does a baby do you start crying?

119
00:05:22.48 --> 00:05:23.48
Yes.

120
00:05:23.48 --> 00:05:27.04
And that's actually kind of the point there where you know, I used to be one of the before

121
00:05:27.04 --> 00:05:31.000
head kids, you know, how when the kid is acting up, you know, your friends kid is acting

122
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.88
up and then you're like, oh, I want to write a kid.

123
00:05:33.88 --> 00:05:38.44
But the parent of the kid always is like, oh, he's just tired or she's just tired.

124
00:05:38.44 --> 00:05:39.44
Yeah.

125
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:40.44
And you know, like you thought it was a lie.

126
00:05:40.44 --> 00:05:41.44
Why?

127
00:05:41.44 --> 00:05:42.44
Why?

128
00:05:42.44 --> 00:05:43.44
She just started.

129
00:05:43.44 --> 00:05:44.44
No, your kid is a brat.

130
00:05:44.44 --> 00:05:46.24
That's what you kind of think, you know, your kid's not tired.

131
00:05:46.24 --> 00:05:47.24
That's a brat.

132
00:05:47.24 --> 00:05:48.24
Always judging.

133
00:05:48.24 --> 00:05:52.12
You know, I think most people without kid that's half.

134
00:05:52.12 --> 00:05:58.36
And after a while, especially when you have kids, you start to realize, oh, I'm in.

135
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:00.44
There's a difference in kids behavior.

136
00:06:00.44 --> 00:06:01.44
Yeah.

137
00:06:01.44 --> 00:06:04.72
Maybe fundamental because this is the one year we're talking about, you know, it's not like

138
00:06:04.72 --> 00:06:06.92
he learned to start crying when he's tired.

139
00:06:06.92 --> 00:06:09.000
It's like when you're tired, you're just less patient.

140
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.72
Even as an adult, you've been tired and you're like waiting for something.

141
00:06:12.72 --> 00:06:19.88
When you're tired and you're waiting for something and it's not coming as quick

142
00:06:19.88 --> 00:06:21.52
as you expected.

143
00:06:21.52 --> 00:06:22.52
Yeah.

144
00:06:22.52 --> 00:06:23.52
What you're used to?

145
00:06:23.52 --> 00:06:24.52
Yeah.

146
00:06:24.52 --> 00:06:27.88
Here's the problem that I run with, with waiting or being held up or when I, this is how I

147
00:06:27.88 --> 00:06:32.80
can realize that's a control freak, a kind of is going to the airport because if you're

148
00:06:32.80 --> 00:06:35.36
running late in the airport, you can't control TSA.

149
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:36.36
Yeah.

150
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:37.36
They're going to take.

151
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:43.68
And of course, if I'm on time for my flight, waiting in the TSA line for five minutes

152
00:06:43.68 --> 00:06:46.20
is not a big deal at all.

153
00:06:46.20 --> 00:06:51.88
If I'm late for my flight, five minutes is an eternity and their pathetic and their

154
00:06:51.88 --> 00:06:53.76
losers and their slow.

155
00:06:53.76 --> 00:06:55.08
And it's all on me.

156
00:06:55.08 --> 00:06:56.64
It's all on me because I went to the airport late.

157
00:06:56.64 --> 00:06:59.84
So I'm not, I get to the airport early because I don't like to have the feeling of things

158
00:06:59.84 --> 00:07:00.84
I can't control.

159
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:02.56
So I'm going to do the best to mitigate it.

160
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:03.88
That's one of those situations.

161
00:07:03.88 --> 00:07:09.72
If you get all tired and then you get all angry and you start crying like a baby, then

162
00:07:09.72 --> 00:07:10.72
guess what?

163
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:15.36
Get more sleep and or and or because sometimes you don't have the choice and you get less

164
00:07:15.36 --> 00:07:16.36
sleep.

165
00:07:16.36 --> 00:07:22.56
So put yourself in check and try and get control those emotions instead of acting like a baby.

166
00:07:22.56 --> 00:07:23.56
Yeah.

167
00:07:23.56 --> 00:07:27.80
I put in in the where you could book one of the lines is Mark.

168
00:07:27.80 --> 00:07:33.64
He's all bummed out and the line was he started crying like a baby.

169
00:07:33.64 --> 00:07:39.40
And and and the the editors were like, you know, you might not want to say that.

170
00:07:39.40 --> 00:07:42.20
You know what kind of gives a bad thing about crying.

171
00:07:42.20 --> 00:07:45.04
Crying is bad and crying is bad and crying is baby is.

172
00:07:45.04 --> 00:07:50.60
And I said, no, actually you're crying like a baby and baby is cry and you know, when

173
00:07:50.60 --> 00:07:53.52
you're a 10 year old kid, you shouldn't be crying like a baby.

174
00:07:53.52 --> 00:07:58.08
And it's him saying about himself, you know, so they were a little sensitive about that

175
00:07:58.08 --> 00:08:00.68
one, but once I kind of debriefed him on it, we were good.

176
00:08:00.68 --> 00:08:06.84
The line remained Mark in his own words broke down start crying like a baby.

177
00:08:06.84 --> 00:08:07.84
Right.

178
00:08:07.84 --> 00:08:14.16
So yeah, because crying like a baby technically is not the same thing is just normal crying

179
00:08:14.16 --> 00:08:15.16
for stuff.

180
00:08:15.16 --> 00:08:16.16
Yeah, sure.

181
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:19.28
Like you're trying like a because why they say crying like a baby really is probably

182
00:08:19.28 --> 00:08:21.92
because baby's cry for literally everything, right?

183
00:08:21.92 --> 00:08:23.48
Anything that they're not happy about the baby.

184
00:08:23.48 --> 00:08:25.16
Because he doesn't know how to talk.

185
00:08:25.16 --> 00:08:28.48
So if you're crying like a baby, you're crying for every little thing.

186
00:08:28.48 --> 00:08:29.80
There you go.

187
00:08:29.80 --> 00:08:34.56
But if you're just crying over, you know, whole life I go or whatever the movie is, you're

188
00:08:34.56 --> 00:08:37.72
watching, then that's what we're different, you know what I'm saying?

189
00:08:37.72 --> 00:08:38.72
The line remained.

190
00:08:38.72 --> 00:08:39.72
That's the good thing.

191
00:08:39.72 --> 00:08:40.72
That's the key right there.

192
00:08:40.72 --> 00:08:43.72
Next question.

193
00:08:43.72 --> 00:08:49.000
Any advice for a second lieutenant, one month into IOC and a couple of months from

194
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.04
this, standing in front of a PLT, plus two of Marines for the first time.

195
00:08:55.04 --> 00:08:59.72
You know what, I almost did answer this one because I answered it all the time for every

196
00:08:59.72 --> 00:09:01.56
different person that's going into a leadership position.

197
00:09:01.56 --> 00:09:03.76
But I'm going to answer one more time just to make sure I'm going to make it brief.

198
00:09:03.76 --> 00:09:05.28
I'm going to make it quick.

199
00:09:05.28 --> 00:09:08.28
But if you're going into a new leadership position, whether you're going to be in charge

200
00:09:08.28 --> 00:09:15.72
of a Marine Corps, Platoon or an Army Platoon or a Seal Platoon or a Division at a

201
00:09:15.72 --> 00:09:20.96
company or a sports team, whatever you're going to be in charge, the principles are the

202
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:21.96
same, right?

203
00:09:21.96 --> 00:09:23.56
We're going to be humble.

204
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:26.04
Number one, we're going to listen.

205
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:30.56
We're not going to act like we know everything because we don't because we're new.

206
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:36.000
There's going to be a gunny sergeant in that platoon that actually does know a lot of stuff.

207
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
You don't.

208
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.40
You don't go in there asking like you do.

209
00:09:39.40 --> 00:09:40.40
You're going to take suggestions.

210
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:42.40
You're going to ask for advice.

211
00:09:42.40 --> 00:09:44.96
You're going to heed the advice when it comes your way.

212
00:09:44.96 --> 00:09:49.96
And now you're going to work harder than everybody else that goes well.

213
00:09:49.96 --> 00:09:51.92
It's going to outwork everybody.

214
00:09:51.92 --> 00:09:54.12
They're going to respect that.

215
00:09:54.12 --> 00:09:58.12
And then when the time comes to be decisive and you've taken on board the various inputs,

216
00:09:58.12 --> 00:10:00.24
you're going to be decisive.

217
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:03.56
Once you've been decisive, that doesn't mean that you're going to hold on and burn in

218
00:10:03.56 --> 00:10:07.84
with that idea, that decision that you made, you can change your mind sometimes.

219
00:10:07.84 --> 00:10:10.28
That's the one thing that always freaked me out about politicians when the politicians

220
00:10:10.28 --> 00:10:13.12
would change their mind and everyone say, oh, they're a flip flopper.

221
00:10:13.12 --> 00:10:14.12
They change their mind.

222
00:10:14.12 --> 00:10:18.88
You know, more information comes to light and your attitude can evolve.

223
00:10:18.88 --> 00:10:20.60
You know, your opinion can evolve.

224
00:10:20.60 --> 00:10:23.08
That's not a horrible thing to me.

225
00:10:23.08 --> 00:10:29.32
Now, if you have somebody that's flip flopping their fundamental principles, that can

226
00:10:29.32 --> 00:10:36.20
obviously, and if the reason for them doing that isn't for new information, it's because

227
00:10:36.20 --> 00:10:40.40
they want this person vote for me or that group of people to vote for me.

228
00:10:40.40 --> 00:10:42.92
Well, then that's obviously a different thing.

229
00:10:42.92 --> 00:10:48.20
But for you to analyze your decision and then let it mature and change, that's not that

230
00:10:48.20 --> 00:10:49.20
big of a deal.

231
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:53.28
And people will get paranoid that your troops won't respect that.

232
00:10:53.28 --> 00:10:55.12
I said, we're going to come in for the West.

233
00:10:55.12 --> 00:10:57.68
So we're just going, I'm not going to change my mind because I'll look weak.

234
00:10:57.68 --> 00:10:58.44
No, no, no, no.

235
00:10:58.44 --> 00:11:03.08
You actually look weak by maintaining a stupid opinion or maintaining course.

236
00:11:03.08 --> 00:11:05.24
That's a bad, the course or bad decision.

237
00:11:05.24 --> 00:11:07.92
So don't do that.

238
00:11:07.92 --> 00:11:09.52
Just be humble.

239
00:11:09.52 --> 00:11:13.12
Be decisive when you have to be, or when you when you need to be.

240
00:11:13.12 --> 00:11:19.24
And then, so remember, there's been all these other leaders throughout history.

241
00:11:19.24 --> 00:11:22.60
Thousands and thousands of years that have stepped up and taken charge of stuff and gone

242
00:11:22.60 --> 00:11:23.60
after it.

243
00:11:23.60 --> 00:11:26.68
So you're going to make some mistakes.

244
00:11:26.68 --> 00:11:30.76
So is everybody that people that are that you're working for made mistakes, too.

245
00:11:30.76 --> 00:11:32.96
That gun resurgent made mistakes.

246
00:11:32.96 --> 00:11:34.32
You know, he wasn't perfect.

247
00:11:34.32 --> 00:11:35.60
So you're going to make mistakes.

248
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:37.16
No, not that big of a deal.

249
00:11:37.16 --> 00:11:38.16
You make a mistake.

250
00:11:38.16 --> 00:11:39.16
What do you do?

251
00:11:39.16 --> 00:11:43.92
Learn from it, move forward.

252
00:11:43.92 --> 00:11:51.84
So that's what you do with the new leadership position and good luck man.

253
00:11:51.84 --> 00:11:56.04
The Petune Commander, Petune Commander, Petune Commander, that's what you want to be.

254
00:11:56.04 --> 00:11:57.16
And that's what you got.

255
00:11:57.16 --> 00:11:59.32
Go and get it.

256
00:11:59.32 --> 00:12:01.72
Semper Fi and thanks for your service.

257
00:12:01.72 --> 00:12:08.40
Yeah, that's, I think that's one, my opinion, is that this question and this answer that

258
00:12:08.40 --> 00:12:12.88
you just gave that I don't think that gets old because that's all hard on it.

259
00:12:12.88 --> 00:12:14.88
And no one feels comfortable.

260
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:16.92
Yeah, actually, let me rephrase that.

261
00:12:16.92 --> 00:12:21.20
The people that feel comfortable already getting their take charge, they're generally

262
00:12:21.20 --> 00:12:26.28
the least ready and are going to have the worst performance because their, their ego's big

263
00:12:26.28 --> 00:12:28.64
and they believe that they're going to crush it.

264
00:12:28.64 --> 00:12:32.24
This guy, this second lieutenant, he is humble.

265
00:12:32.24 --> 00:12:33.24
He's aware.

266
00:12:33.24 --> 00:12:34.44
He's like, hey man, what can I do?

267
00:12:34.44 --> 00:12:35.44
How can I be ready for this?

268
00:12:35.44 --> 00:12:37.04
That's, that's the perfect place to be at.

269
00:12:37.04 --> 00:12:38.72
Yeah, like a healthy amount of doubt.

270
00:12:38.72 --> 00:12:43.60
Yeah, the late, late told that story a couple times where when he was the executive officer

271
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:48.28
of the sealed team or the ops officer to seal team, if he called out and I was running training,

272
00:12:48.28 --> 00:12:52.84
so his seal team was going through training and he would call, you know, the Petune Commander,

273
00:12:52.84 --> 00:12:56.12
the troop commander and he's, you know, how's everything going out there?

274
00:12:56.12 --> 00:12:58.96
And if he's, if they answered, we're crushing it.

275
00:12:58.96 --> 00:12:59.96
Right, right.

276
00:12:59.96 --> 00:13:04.36
Late would say, uh, oh, we got issues because, because, factually, he, you know, he knew,

277
00:13:04.36 --> 00:13:08.32
you know, he knew I was running training, the wasn't anyone's going to crush the training

278
00:13:08.32 --> 00:13:09.80
early running.

279
00:13:09.80 --> 00:13:14.08
And so if their answer wasn't, you know, hey, the training is really hard and we're doing

280
00:13:14.08 --> 00:13:15.08
our best.

281
00:13:15.08 --> 00:13:16.08
We're learning a lot.

282
00:13:16.08 --> 00:13:17.08
Those guys, he's okay.

283
00:13:17.08 --> 00:13:20.84
They're good to go and I'll go see him, you know, in a week or so.

284
00:13:20.84 --> 00:13:23.000
If they said they were crushing it, he said, yeah, I'm going to come out and see you

285
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.20
guys tomorrow.

286
00:13:24.20 --> 00:13:27.48
And then when they get out there, he'd say what's going on.

287
00:13:27.48 --> 00:13:29.08
I'd say, that's not good.

288
00:13:29.08 --> 00:13:34.32
So yeah, that attitude of we're crushing it is generally an indicator of, you know,

289
00:13:34.32 --> 00:13:36.80
you're probably not doing the best job.

290
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:37.80
Yeah.

291
00:13:37.80 --> 00:13:38.96
So stay humble.

292
00:13:38.96 --> 00:13:42.76
That's the indicator of how they're going to move forward to, you know, like

293
00:13:42.76 --> 00:13:43.96
their attitude and work out.

294
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:44.96
I'm doing great.

295
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:45.96
Yeah, no.

296
00:13:45.96 --> 00:13:49.96
You're not doing great.

297
00:13:49.96 --> 00:13:51.36
None of us are.

298
00:13:51.36 --> 00:13:53.36
At a minimum, we can do better.

299
00:13:53.36 --> 00:13:54.36
Right.

300
00:13:54.36 --> 00:13:58.04
So the minute you say, I'm doing great, go backwards.

301
00:13:58.04 --> 00:13:59.28
Next question.

302
00:13:59.28 --> 00:14:03.64
How long did it take you to get promoted to a blue belt?

303
00:14:03.64 --> 00:14:08.12
And how often were you training during that time?

304
00:14:08.12 --> 00:14:10.28
So real simple question.

305
00:14:10.28 --> 00:14:16.40
It took me, I think about nine or 10 months to get my blue belt sheet.

306
00:14:16.40 --> 00:14:22.16
And when I was at that time, I, I was at Sulteen one.

307
00:14:22.16 --> 00:14:25.16
I was in the training department.

308
00:14:25.16 --> 00:14:28.92
And I had a lot of opportunity to train.

309
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:33.60
At that time, Clinton years, not a lot of money.

310
00:14:33.60 --> 00:14:35.84
To train in the sealed teams.

311
00:14:35.84 --> 00:14:40.72
So less trips, shorter trips, less travel.

312
00:14:40.72 --> 00:14:42.64
So we were staying around a little bit more.

313
00:14:42.64 --> 00:14:45.12
No war going on on top of all that.

314
00:14:45.12 --> 00:14:48.000
So we were, we were home a little bit more.

315
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And so I trained all the time.

316
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.92
I would go to lunch at lunch.

317
00:14:50.92 --> 00:14:53.92
I would zip over to Fabio Santos.

318
00:14:53.92 --> 00:14:54.36
OK.

319
00:14:54.36 --> 00:14:56.000
And train the lunch time class.

320
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.28
And then I'd zip back and do work.

321
00:14:57.28 --> 00:14:58.08
And then we'd get done.

322
00:14:58.08 --> 00:14:59.40
I'd go back.

323
00:14:59.40 --> 00:15:02.08
And I would do the beginner class.

324
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:03.76
And then I would do the advanced class.

325
00:15:03.76 --> 00:15:08.56
And then I would roll a dean and hegs and James Nielsen and Craig and the rest of the

326
00:15:08.56 --> 00:15:11.92
guys that were there at Fabio at the time.

327
00:15:11.92 --> 00:15:16.84
And Fabio used to kick dean and I off the mat at like nine o'clock at night.

328
00:15:16.84 --> 00:15:17.84
Yeah, take it to you long.

329
00:15:17.84 --> 00:15:22.04
Yeah, and he'd say, why don't you guys get a life?

330
00:15:22.04 --> 00:15:23.32
Why are you doing?

331
00:15:23.32 --> 00:15:25.20
And we'd say we're just training the juit to do.

332
00:15:25.20 --> 00:15:26.40
You say we got a life.

333
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:27.40
It's right here.

334
00:15:27.40 --> 00:15:28.40
I'll leave you this.

335
00:15:28.40 --> 00:15:29.40
This is it.

336
00:15:29.40 --> 00:15:34.76
And so it was mostly at Fabio's like, you know, you said you'd like train with your,

337
00:15:34.76 --> 00:15:37.84
you know, your guys, you weren't trained to whatever was there that going on?

338
00:15:37.84 --> 00:15:41.48
Yeah, yeah, anybody that wanted to roll with me, I had the same policy that I have

339
00:15:41.48 --> 00:15:42.48
right now.

340
00:15:42.48 --> 00:15:43.48
You want to roll?

341
00:15:43.48 --> 00:15:44.48
Yeah.

342
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:45.48
Let's roll.

343
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:46.48
Well, I have my gear.

344
00:15:46.48 --> 00:15:47.48
It's in my bag right now.

345
00:15:47.48 --> 00:15:48.48
If you want to train, we'll train.

346
00:15:48.48 --> 00:15:53.40
Oh, it's, you know, Thursday afternoon and it's two o'clock and we don't have any work to

347
00:15:53.40 --> 00:15:54.44
do and you want to train cool.

348
00:15:54.44 --> 00:15:55.44
We'll train.

349
00:15:55.44 --> 00:15:57.48
So yeah, I was doing that all the time.

350
00:15:57.48 --> 00:16:02.52
And the thing is once I got blue belt, because I think I got blue belt pretty quickly.

351
00:16:02.52 --> 00:16:09.48
And but I was a blue belt for a long time because I write as I was probably getting

352
00:16:09.48 --> 00:16:12.44
close to getting my purple belt.

353
00:16:12.44 --> 00:16:15.92
I left California and I went to Virginia Beach.

354
00:16:15.92 --> 00:16:22.12
Once I got to Virginia Beach stepped into a new dojo with Gustavo Machado.

355
00:16:22.12 --> 00:16:26.80
And you know, started training with Gustavo and I'm just a blue belt, right?

356
00:16:26.80 --> 00:16:30.48
And so he's got to know, learn me figure out what my personality is like.

357
00:16:30.48 --> 00:16:34.48
See what my potential is as a person.

358
00:16:34.48 --> 00:16:36.20
And I trained really hard there.

359
00:16:36.20 --> 00:16:38.88
But I was also gone a lot traveling and that's why I was traveling a lot on the road.

360
00:16:38.88 --> 00:16:41.72
And I would train with guys on the road and I went on deployment, train with guys on the

361
00:16:41.72 --> 00:16:45.16
deployment and then it would come back in a town.

362
00:16:45.16 --> 00:16:49.48
And so I didn't get consistent enough with him eyes with him where he said, hey, this

363
00:16:49.48 --> 00:16:51.44
guy's ready for his purple belt.

364
00:16:51.44 --> 00:16:57.08
So by the time I might have been close to him thinking, okay, you know what?

365
00:16:57.08 --> 00:17:01.60
And he started looking to him for purple belt went back to San Diego.

366
00:17:01.60 --> 00:17:03.32
Got back to San Diego.

367
00:17:03.32 --> 00:17:06.000
And now I check back into Fabios.

368
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.96
Well, it's been two years, bro.

369
00:17:08.96 --> 00:17:11.24
You need to prove yourself again.

370
00:17:11.24 --> 00:17:17.36
So it was almost like I was at the bottom of the pecking order in terms of time and rain,

371
00:17:17.36 --> 00:17:19.24
even though I'd been a blue belt for a long time.

372
00:17:19.24 --> 00:17:22.24
So I ended up being a blue belt for a long time.

373
00:17:22.24 --> 00:17:27.56
I want to say it was a blue belt for maybe like five years.

374
00:17:27.56 --> 00:17:28.56
Yeah, that's.

375
00:17:28.56 --> 00:17:29.56
And I was a good blue belt.

376
00:17:29.56 --> 00:17:30.56
Don't get me wrong.

377
00:17:30.56 --> 00:17:32.000
Sure, of course it were.

378
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.04
And but you know, it was a long time.

379
00:17:35.04 --> 00:17:39.48
When you jump around from school to school and the instructor doesn't know you well enough,

380
00:17:39.48 --> 00:17:43.48
it doesn't see you on a regular basis and can't assess your improvement because that's

381
00:17:43.48 --> 00:17:45.000
the thing with you, Jitsu.

382
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.16
In my opinion, for your, you don't get your belt.

383
00:17:50.16 --> 00:17:53.76
There's not a level playing field for every person.

384
00:17:53.76 --> 00:17:58.96
So in other words, it's not, hey, these are the skills required for blue belt and now you

385
00:17:58.96 --> 00:17:59.96
get your blue belt.

386
00:17:59.96 --> 00:18:05.60
And then you learn these other, you know, these other 127 other moves and now you get your

387
00:18:05.60 --> 00:18:06.60
purple belt.

388
00:18:06.60 --> 00:18:10.000
Now there's three hundred and ten moves to get your, it's not like that at all.

389
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.20
Yeah.

390
00:18:11.20 --> 00:18:15.68
In fact, it's also not, hey, how do you as a blue belt do against this other group

391
00:18:15.68 --> 00:18:17.000
of blue belts?

392
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.32
What it is, and I know this sounds a little bit cliche, but it's, it's really how good

393
00:18:22.32 --> 00:18:24.80
or you against you, right?

394
00:18:24.80 --> 00:18:29.72
Because if somebody, you know, you let's say you get somebody that starts, you Jitsu

395
00:18:29.72 --> 00:18:34.28
when they're older, you know, maybe they're 55 years old.

396
00:18:34.28 --> 00:18:39.52
They're going to go and they train until they're 62 or they're training and training and

397
00:18:39.52 --> 00:18:40.52
training.

398
00:18:40.52 --> 00:18:41.52
Here's skill level.

399
00:18:41.52 --> 00:18:42.68
They're getting injured.

400
00:18:42.68 --> 00:18:43.68
They're having issues.

401
00:18:43.68 --> 00:18:44.68
They got to work.

402
00:18:44.68 --> 00:18:47.72
They got to do a bunch of things and they can't, they're hobbyists, right?

403
00:18:47.72 --> 00:18:50.84
They're not focused and they can only train so much.

404
00:18:50.84 --> 00:18:51.84
They learn the moves.

405
00:18:51.84 --> 00:18:53.96
They get better 10 years go by.

406
00:18:53.96 --> 00:18:57.20
There's a chance that they're going to be a black belt based on the fact that, hey,

407
00:18:57.20 --> 00:19:01.52
as a 55 year old person that came in here and started training and it moves that you've

408
00:19:01.52 --> 00:19:05.72
learned and how you've applied them according to your athletic ability and your physical

409
00:19:05.72 --> 00:19:06.72
capability at the time.

410
00:19:06.72 --> 00:19:10.92
Hey, it's been 10 years, which is a pretty rough number for like, you know, forgetting

411
00:19:10.92 --> 00:19:13.32
your black belt.

412
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:14.64
So that's acceptable.

413
00:19:14.64 --> 00:19:21.16
But you might get a kid that's a really good athlete that in two years can destroy

414
00:19:21.16 --> 00:19:26.68
that guy and he's not getting his black belt because you're saying, what is your potential?

415
00:19:26.68 --> 00:19:28.64
How good can you be as a black belt?

416
00:19:28.64 --> 00:19:29.64
That's the question.

417
00:19:29.64 --> 00:19:32.52
So really, it's almost a compliment.

418
00:19:32.52 --> 00:19:37.000
The longer it takes you to get your belts, that means, in my opinion, that means the better

419
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.88
you're going to, that means the better that you're instructor thinks you're going to be.

420
00:19:40.88 --> 00:19:41.88
Yeah.

421
00:19:41.88 --> 00:19:42.88
That's my, that's my thought.

422
00:19:42.88 --> 00:19:44.12
And not everyone does it like that.

423
00:19:44.12 --> 00:19:48.44
You know, some people think, oh, if this purple belt can be that purple belt, you know,

424
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:49.52
this purple belt's better.

425
00:19:49.52 --> 00:19:50.52
Yeah.

426
00:19:50.52 --> 00:19:53.64
And if this purple belt can be the brown belt, then I need to give him his brown belt.

427
00:19:53.64 --> 00:19:55.08
Not too many think people think that way.

428
00:19:55.08 --> 00:19:56.36
You know, who thinks that way?

429
00:19:56.36 --> 00:19:57.36
The purple belt.

430
00:19:57.36 --> 00:19:58.36
I can beat the brown belt.

431
00:19:58.36 --> 00:19:59.36
I should be a brown belt.

432
00:19:59.36 --> 00:20:00.36
No.

433
00:20:00.36 --> 00:20:01.36
No wrong.

434
00:20:01.36 --> 00:20:02.36
Yeah.

435
00:20:02.36 --> 00:20:03.36
So true.

436
00:20:03.36 --> 00:20:07.92
And there's so many, there's so many of those little things.

437
00:20:07.92 --> 00:20:13.24
Like the reason an instructor might be influenced to give someone, I mean, typically, they're

438
00:20:13.24 --> 00:20:18.70
not going to give someone a belt based solely on the fact that he taps out that, you know,

439
00:20:18.70 --> 00:20:19.70
brown belt.

440
00:20:19.70 --> 00:20:21.04
So, but it is influenced by that.

441
00:20:21.04 --> 00:20:22.04
It is.

442
00:20:22.04 --> 00:20:23.04
Oh, there's all these weird things.

443
00:20:23.04 --> 00:20:27.000
There's stuff like, sometimes I'm watching like a two blue belts and they'll see

444
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
that I'm watching and it turns into a death mask.

445
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
There's no monster tab.

446
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Actually, you know what?

447
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.72
That's just saw a video of a guy with a camera.

448
00:20:33.72 --> 00:20:34.72
I think you put it on.

449
00:20:34.72 --> 00:20:36.72
I saw that live.

450
00:20:36.72 --> 00:20:38.20
What kind of intro does elbow you think?

451
00:20:38.20 --> 00:20:39.84
Because look like it's elbow.

452
00:20:39.84 --> 00:20:41.12
Yeah, maybe like crap.

453
00:20:41.12 --> 00:20:43.12
Yeah, didn't tap to the camera.

454
00:20:43.12 --> 00:20:44.80
The camera is a beast, man.

455
00:20:44.80 --> 00:20:46.08
The camera is a beast.

456
00:20:46.08 --> 00:20:48.40
You know, you can not tap to a footlock.

457
00:20:48.40 --> 00:20:50.24
You can not tap to.

458
00:20:50.24 --> 00:20:52.80
You can even not tap to a heel hook.

459
00:20:52.80 --> 00:20:54.64
You look and go really sideways.

460
00:20:54.64 --> 00:20:56.84
But you don't tap to a camera.

461
00:20:56.84 --> 00:20:58.84
You're probably going to have some issues.

462
00:20:58.84 --> 00:20:59.84
Yeah.

463
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:00.84
I'm not able to watch.

464
00:21:00.84 --> 00:21:04.52
Like I've seen guys like get their, you know, their knee and stuff, you know, heel

465
00:21:04.52 --> 00:21:06.84
hook and it's like, oh, I'll take that.

466
00:21:06.84 --> 00:21:10.48
Yeah, but man, like, like, you know, when you see the guys, arm just bent that way.

467
00:21:10.48 --> 00:21:13.08
Man, man, and I did it post that video.

468
00:21:13.08 --> 00:21:14.08
Someone else posted it.

469
00:21:14.08 --> 00:21:15.32
I would never post videos like that.

470
00:21:15.32 --> 00:21:16.88
In fact, I don't like to watch that.

471
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:17.88
I saw live.

472
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:20.88
Is that what I did to your shoulder recording to the success rate?

473
00:21:20.88 --> 00:21:25.32
Almost separated your shoulder separated.

474
00:21:25.32 --> 00:21:27.36
It did not people do that.

475
00:21:27.36 --> 00:21:29.56
I know it sounded nice and dramatic.

476
00:21:29.56 --> 00:21:30.56
But it didn't happen.

477
00:21:30.56 --> 00:21:32.76
Yeah, I don't think you've ever almost said that.

478
00:21:32.76 --> 00:21:33.76
It's not even a shoulder.

479
00:21:33.76 --> 00:21:34.76
No.

480
00:21:34.76 --> 00:21:41.24
Yeah, but as far as, as far as people getting, uh, instruction is getting influenced on

481
00:21:41.24 --> 00:21:44.36
a wide of give guys belts or a higher belt.

482
00:21:44.36 --> 00:21:47.32
Like some instructions, for example, they'll be influenced now.

483
00:21:47.32 --> 00:21:52.56
But to give a guy higher belt because I want to have more black belts underneath, you

484
00:21:52.56 --> 00:21:54.56
know, we have a team of black belts.

485
00:21:54.56 --> 00:21:58.20
And typically that'll have a lot to do with sales, you know, like where I can be like,

486
00:21:58.20 --> 00:22:02.16
hey, I have, you know, a team of, you know, and I've heard the sales pitch, you know,

487
00:22:02.16 --> 00:22:05.68
where it's like, hey, we have seven, seven black belts on the mat, three world champ.

488
00:22:05.68 --> 00:22:06.68
You know, that's good.

489
00:22:06.68 --> 00:22:07.68
That's good.

490
00:22:07.68 --> 00:22:09.08
So people might be influenced by that.

491
00:22:09.08 --> 00:22:11.60
And then they'll be like, okay, maybe I'll give these two guys their belt.

492
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:13.44
So now we have four black belts or whatever.

493
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:14.44
There's that.

494
00:22:14.44 --> 00:22:20.16
And then they're, if that's the reason, you know, I mean, it is good to have 10

495
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:21.16
black belts in your association.

496
00:22:21.16 --> 00:22:22.64
Yeah, because that is good to do.

497
00:22:22.64 --> 00:22:23.64
Yeah, for sure.

498
00:22:23.64 --> 00:22:25.56
And but then there's the opposite too.

499
00:22:25.56 --> 00:22:29.20
Or guys will be like, if they're in this typically happens if they're competing.

500
00:22:29.28 --> 00:22:33.24
So if a coach is like, A, I got these five brown belts there.

501
00:22:33.96 --> 00:22:37.68
Obviously on the level of black belt knowledge performance, all this stuff.

502
00:22:37.68 --> 00:22:40.24
But when they go in the tournament in the brown belt, they're killing.

503
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:42.76
We got gold medals, gold team medals every time.

504
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:44.88
So though then there's that sandwich bag in.

505
00:22:45.28 --> 00:22:46.44
Centenne bag in the black.

506
00:22:46.44 --> 00:22:46.72
Right.

507
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:48.20
So there's, yeah, there's all those things.

508
00:22:49.80 --> 00:22:51.44
In regards to the belt, I said this before.

509
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:52.52
I'm gonna say it again.

510
00:22:52.52 --> 00:22:58.40
The belt really doesn't have to do with how good you think you are or how good even

511
00:22:58.40 --> 00:22:59.56
you know you are.

512
00:22:59.92 --> 00:23:05.24
If you're like, hey, I'm tapping a, you know, I'm a white belt.

513
00:23:05.24 --> 00:23:08.12
For example, I'm white belt and I'm hanging with the purple belts.

514
00:23:08.12 --> 00:23:10.92
I'm tapping blue belts and brown belts are getting.

515
00:23:10.92 --> 00:23:12.56
I'm giving them a hard time.

516
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.72
So I should be a blue belt.

517
00:23:15.72 --> 00:23:16.92
It doesn't matter.

518
00:23:16.92 --> 00:23:17.96
It doesn't matter at all.

519
00:23:17.96 --> 00:23:20.16
And you know, it sounds like an exaggeration.

520
00:23:20.16 --> 00:23:20.88
It doesn't matter at all.

521
00:23:20.88 --> 00:23:22.32
It doesn't matter who's a little bit here.

522
00:23:22.32 --> 00:23:23.16
I think no, it doesn't.

523
00:23:23.16 --> 00:23:25.64
Your skill is evaluated by your instructor.

524
00:23:25.64 --> 00:23:28.32
That's the reason why you can be at a certain level.

525
00:23:28.32 --> 00:23:29.08
Leave.

526
00:23:29.88 --> 00:23:32.48
Come back and still not because of your instructor.

527
00:23:32.48 --> 00:23:34.48
You can be going dominating everywhere.

528
00:23:34.48 --> 00:23:35.88
Then instructor has to evaluate.

529
00:23:35.88 --> 00:23:38.36
Yeah, that's exactly what happened with me.

530
00:23:38.36 --> 00:23:40.000
And it wasn't a negative thing.

531
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.32
It was like, hey, you've been gone for two years.

532
00:23:41.32 --> 00:23:42.68
We're gonna see where you're at, Draco.

533
00:23:42.68 --> 00:23:43.68
Yeah.

534
00:23:43.68 --> 00:23:44.68
And it's not just one day thing.

535
00:23:44.68 --> 00:23:45.88
We're back in here and get your purple belt.

536
00:23:45.88 --> 00:23:46.88
Yeah.

537
00:23:46.88 --> 00:23:48.44
Just because you've been training for two straight years.

538
00:23:48.44 --> 00:23:49.44
Yeah.

539
00:23:49.44 --> 00:23:52.84
And you know what's interesting, too, is this, I obviously this applies to people

540
00:23:52.84 --> 00:23:53.84
in the business world.

541
00:23:53.84 --> 00:23:55.56
People trying to get promoted.

542
00:23:55.56 --> 00:23:59.80
And the more you're thinking, hey, I'm better at this job than this guy.

543
00:23:59.80 --> 00:24:01.92
I should get, there's something else going on.

544
00:24:01.92 --> 00:24:06.04
There's something you look at and the more frustrated you get about not getting that

545
00:24:06.04 --> 00:24:10.24
promotion, not getting taken care of, not getting noticed.

546
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:12.56
Just do your job work hard.

547
00:24:12.56 --> 00:24:15.56
You know, don't worry about the promotion and the promotion promotion is going to

548
00:24:15.56 --> 00:24:17.20
come in most cases.

549
00:24:17.20 --> 00:24:18.20
Yeah.

550
00:24:18.20 --> 00:24:26.92
So I would even frame it where I would say in all cases, there are exceptions like

551
00:24:26.92 --> 00:24:29.92
everything else, but in all cases, that is the situation.

552
00:24:29.92 --> 00:24:30.92
Yeah.

553
00:24:30.92 --> 00:24:33.92
And think about this, too, when you in regards to like your belt, right?

554
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:35.32
You just two belt.

555
00:24:35.32 --> 00:24:39.56
If I'm a white belt, Draco, you're my instructor.

556
00:24:39.56 --> 00:24:41.72
And I'm like, hey, I'm winning all these tournaments.

557
00:24:41.72 --> 00:24:45.16
All of them go not a point score all by submission.

558
00:24:45.16 --> 00:24:49.52
I'm tapping up blue belts and purple belts sometimes, hey, Jocko, give me my blue belt.

559
00:24:49.52 --> 00:24:50.52
All right.

560
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:51.52
I can't do that.

561
00:24:51.52 --> 00:24:53.24
You, it's not up to me.

562
00:24:53.24 --> 00:24:57.32
Even if I beg you, I go on the internet, I post this petition.

563
00:24:57.32 --> 00:24:58.32
It's not up to me.

564
00:24:58.32 --> 00:25:00.68
See, this is the thing.

565
00:25:00.68 --> 00:25:05.08
You know, when you hear in martial arts, like old traditional martial arts, like you

566
00:25:05.08 --> 00:25:08.36
will learn humility and you will learn discipline.

567
00:25:08.36 --> 00:25:12.64
And they would teach it, you know, by teaching it, by talking about it.

568
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:14.04
In the digital, it's real.

569
00:25:14.04 --> 00:25:15.04
Yeah.

570
00:25:15.04 --> 00:25:20.72
And when you flare up and say, where's my belt?

571
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:22.24
That's you not being humble.

572
00:25:22.24 --> 00:25:24.92
That's you not, you know, just saying, hey, I need to work harder.

573
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:26.56
I need to keep getting after it.

574
00:25:26.56 --> 00:25:28.32
And so you're learning that lesson there.

575
00:25:28.32 --> 00:25:29.32
Yeah.

576
00:25:29.32 --> 00:25:30.32
That's part of the lesson.

577
00:25:30.32 --> 00:25:31.32
That's the way it should be.

578
00:25:31.32 --> 00:25:34.64
You know, and again, I've mentioned this before in the podcast, just because someone

579
00:25:34.64 --> 00:25:38.12
is a G.J. two person, just because they're a black belt, doesn't mean they have the

580
00:25:38.12 --> 00:25:39.12
same.

581
00:25:39.12 --> 00:25:42.08
It doesn't mean they have like the best morals and values.

582
00:25:42.08 --> 00:25:43.08
It doesn't mean that at all.

583
00:25:43.08 --> 00:25:44.96
There could be people selling belts.

584
00:25:44.96 --> 00:25:45.96
There's people that sell belts.

585
00:25:45.96 --> 00:25:50.84
Oh, you, you go to take 10 privates with me $1000 each and then then you'll, that's

586
00:25:50.84 --> 00:25:51.84
how you get the black belt.

587
00:25:51.84 --> 00:25:52.84
Okay, cool.

588
00:25:52.84 --> 00:25:53.84
No, not cool.

589
00:25:53.84 --> 00:25:55.84
So there's a bunch of things like that too.

590
00:25:55.84 --> 00:25:58.96
You know, I want you to go open a pilot school for me somewhere.

591
00:25:58.96 --> 00:26:00.28
So I'm going to give you your black belt.

592
00:26:00.28 --> 00:26:02.12
You know, you're not that good.

593
00:26:02.12 --> 00:26:08.72
So that way you can, you can give me my, you know, 12% of your annual earnings.

594
00:26:08.72 --> 00:26:11.20
You know, those things like that happen.

595
00:26:11.20 --> 00:26:15.64
There's, you know, even worse things that happen, but the bottom line is an appearer,

596
00:26:15.64 --> 00:26:17.20
G.J. two cents.

597
00:26:17.20 --> 00:26:22.12
You should be working hard in getting promoted as it comes from your instructor.

598
00:26:22.12 --> 00:26:23.12
Yeah.

599
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:24.12
So essentially the promote you.

600
00:26:24.12 --> 00:26:27.12
Is this sort of like an indirect way of you talking to me about your belt?

601
00:26:27.12 --> 00:26:28.56
No, not at all.

602
00:26:28.56 --> 00:26:32.72
Actually, actually, if it does apply to me, it doesn't matter.

603
00:26:32.72 --> 00:26:33.72
It doesn't matter.

604
00:26:33.72 --> 00:26:36.52
It will less than anyone cares or doesn't care.

605
00:26:36.52 --> 00:26:37.52
Of course.

606
00:26:37.52 --> 00:26:39.92
I think everyone cares in one way or another.

607
00:26:39.92 --> 00:26:43.36
But I'd say the approach, it more has to do with the approach.

608
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:46.80
Like just like I said, focus on getting better, focus on the learning.

609
00:26:46.80 --> 00:26:47.80
That's it.

610
00:26:47.80 --> 00:26:49.32
The belt is just a symptom of your learning.

611
00:26:49.32 --> 00:26:52.64
It's an eventuality essentially.

612
00:26:52.64 --> 00:26:56.84
Same thing or back to the fact that it doesn't have anything to do with the person, only

613
00:26:56.84 --> 00:27:01.20
the instructor on the flip side, what I said about, you know, if I think I'm, I think I'm a

614
00:27:01.20 --> 00:27:03.56
blue belt and I'm not getting my blue belt.

615
00:27:03.56 --> 00:27:04.56
What's up?

616
00:27:04.56 --> 00:27:05.56
It's not up to me.

617
00:27:05.56 --> 00:27:06.56
It's something structure.

618
00:27:06.56 --> 00:27:07.56
No matter what.

619
00:27:07.56 --> 00:27:09.80
Same thing is if you, you're like, hey, a promotion time.

620
00:27:09.80 --> 00:27:12.88
Hey, echo, here's your blue belt and I'm like, I'm not ready for this blue belt.

621
00:27:12.88 --> 00:27:13.88
I suck.

622
00:27:13.88 --> 00:27:16.44
I can't even do this.

623
00:27:16.44 --> 00:27:18.24
I can't give the belt back.

624
00:27:18.24 --> 00:27:22.000
I can't like take it off and then put it, you know, I mean, I'm sure there's some kind

625
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
of excitement.

626
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.52
There's that thing that happened long time ago with them with Anton.

627
00:27:25.52 --> 00:27:26.52
That wasn't a lot of time.

628
00:27:26.52 --> 00:27:27.52
I was like a year ago.

629
00:27:27.52 --> 00:27:29.52
Yeah, that's long time ago.

630
00:27:29.52 --> 00:27:30.52
Okay.

631
00:27:30.52 --> 00:27:33.88
But nonetheless, you know, I can't give it back to you when you get a motor.

632
00:27:33.88 --> 00:27:34.88
You're ready for it.

633
00:27:34.88 --> 00:27:35.88
Yeah.

634
00:27:35.88 --> 00:27:37.44
Put your belt on and start starting after your hard path.

635
00:27:37.44 --> 00:27:40.52
Because if nothing do with your opinion, that's the point there.

636
00:27:40.52 --> 00:27:41.52
So yeah, it's your instrument.

637
00:27:41.52 --> 00:27:42.52
And they keep training.

638
00:27:42.52 --> 00:27:43.52
Yeah.

639
00:27:43.52 --> 00:27:44.96
Because sometimes people get their belts and they stop training.

640
00:27:44.96 --> 00:27:45.96
Yeah, that's an integral.

641
00:27:45.96 --> 00:27:50.88
Here's the thing, all admit there was a point in my life where I was like concerned

642
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:51.88
about that.

643
00:27:51.88 --> 00:27:53.16
I'm like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm better than this guy.

644
00:27:53.16 --> 00:27:56.48
I'm not going to say when which belt it was not recently my new.

645
00:27:56.48 --> 00:27:57.88
But that's three weeks ago.

646
00:27:57.88 --> 00:28:01.16
I guess I shouldn't sit.

647
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:04.88
But man, I remember and when I think about that time man, how was it learning that much

648
00:28:04.88 --> 00:28:05.88
at all?

649
00:28:05.88 --> 00:28:07.40
I was just focusing on like, whoa, good.

650
00:28:07.40 --> 00:28:08.40
You do.

651
00:28:08.40 --> 00:28:10.20
So like, you know, your game kind is closed off.

652
00:28:10.20 --> 00:28:11.20
You don't learn much.

653
00:28:11.20 --> 00:28:12.88
You're concerned about, you know, all this stuff.

654
00:28:12.88 --> 00:28:13.88
And it's just happening.

655
00:28:13.88 --> 00:28:16.04
You're not taking your risks.

656
00:28:16.04 --> 00:28:17.04
Not learning.

657
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:18.04
Yeah, exactly.

658
00:28:18.04 --> 00:28:21.28
And it just messes up your whole due to experience because you have that, you have that

659
00:28:21.28 --> 00:28:23.20
outlet added element of stress.

660
00:28:23.20 --> 00:28:24.20
It's not good.

661
00:28:24.20 --> 00:28:25.20
Don't do that.

662
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:27.08
So don't even ask about belts.

663
00:28:27.08 --> 00:28:29.28
I think that's a good, that's a great.

664
00:28:29.28 --> 00:28:31.32
That isn't, that is a great policy.

665
00:28:31.32 --> 00:28:32.32
Yeah.

666
00:28:32.32 --> 00:28:33.92
That's the best policy for those.

667
00:28:33.92 --> 00:28:37.32
Do no and ask them to train hard and you'll get what's coming to you eventually.

668
00:28:37.32 --> 00:28:40.64
But sometimes people will ask you, hey, when are you going to get your blue belt or, you

669
00:28:40.64 --> 00:28:42.88
know, you know, people will ask you that whenever I don't know.

670
00:28:42.88 --> 00:28:43.88
Yeah, whatever.

671
00:28:43.88 --> 00:28:47.12
My Instagram's going to ask me when I'm going to get the red and black belt.

672
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:50.12
I'll just get you know what else to be like.

673
00:28:50.12 --> 00:28:52.96
Talk to the way they're adding the coral belt.

674
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:53.96
Interesting.

675
00:28:53.96 --> 00:28:54.96
Yeah.

676
00:28:54.96 --> 00:28:55.96
Good.

677
00:28:55.96 --> 00:28:56.96
Next question.

678
00:28:56.96 --> 00:29:04.20
What's the best approach to managing people that outperform you?

679
00:29:04.20 --> 00:29:07.28
Yeah, I think this is a simple question as well.

680
00:29:07.28 --> 00:29:11.36
You do in this situation as you give them all the support you can and let them run.

681
00:29:11.36 --> 00:29:13.44
I'm happy if someone's outperform me.

682
00:29:13.44 --> 00:29:14.44
That's great.

683
00:29:14.44 --> 00:29:15.44
You know what else I'll do?

684
00:29:15.44 --> 00:29:16.44
Trying to learn from them.

685
00:29:16.44 --> 00:29:17.44
Let's see what they're doing.

686
00:29:17.44 --> 00:29:18.44
Trying spread the word.

687
00:29:18.44 --> 00:29:20.84
If I'm going to leadership position and someone's doing outperforming everyone.

688
00:29:20.84 --> 00:29:21.84
Great.

689
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:22.84
How can we take that?

690
00:29:22.84 --> 00:29:23.84
How can we teach everyone else?

691
00:29:23.84 --> 00:29:26.64
How can I give them supports they can run even faster?

692
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:27.64
This is no factor to me.

693
00:29:27.64 --> 00:29:28.64
I love it.

694
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:29.64
You should be surrounding.

695
00:29:29.64 --> 00:29:32.04
The more people you can bring on your team, that how perform you, the better you're

696
00:29:32.04 --> 00:29:33.04
going to do.

697
00:29:33.04 --> 00:29:34.04
True.

698
00:29:34.04 --> 00:29:35.04
Check.

699
00:29:35.04 --> 00:29:36.04
Easy one.

700
00:29:36.04 --> 00:29:37.04
Easy one.

701
00:29:37.04 --> 00:29:38.04
Next question.

702
00:29:38.04 --> 00:29:39.04
Next question.

703
00:29:39.04 --> 00:29:42.04
Yeah, a lot of times it's hard though.

704
00:29:42.04 --> 00:29:44.04
You know, and I know you're going to say.

705
00:29:44.04 --> 00:29:45.04
Such an ego.

706
00:29:45.04 --> 00:29:46.04
Urgh.

707
00:29:46.04 --> 00:29:47.44
Oh, do I'm not going to say it that voice?

708
00:29:47.44 --> 00:29:48.76
Is it not true?

709
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:49.76
We know it's your ego.

710
00:29:49.76 --> 00:29:50.76
It's 100% ego.

711
00:29:50.76 --> 00:29:52.76
When you can't support somebody that's doing better than you.

712
00:29:52.76 --> 00:29:53.76
It's 100% ego.

713
00:29:53.76 --> 00:29:55.12
Why else would you not support them?

714
00:29:55.12 --> 00:29:56.12
They're helping the team win.

715
00:29:56.12 --> 00:29:58.36
They're helping everyone do better.

716
00:29:58.36 --> 00:29:59.36
Why would you not support them?

717
00:29:59.36 --> 00:30:01.36
Because your ego, because you're like, at herats.

718
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:02.36
Yeah.

719
00:30:02.36 --> 00:30:03.36
I want to be the guy.

720
00:30:03.36 --> 00:30:08.40
And you know what you look like then, you look like a jealous baby little baby word of

721
00:30:08.40 --> 00:30:10.40
the day baby.

722
00:30:10.40 --> 00:30:12.24
You look a little jealous little baby.

723
00:30:12.24 --> 00:30:15.80
Because you're trying to hold them back and everyone can see it and everyone can tell.

724
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:17.60
It just don't be that person.

725
00:30:17.60 --> 00:30:18.60
Yeah, right.

726
00:30:18.60 --> 00:30:19.60
That's a good point right there.

727
00:30:19.60 --> 00:30:20.60
Everyone can tell.

728
00:30:20.60 --> 00:30:22.60
Everyone can tell what's going on.

729
00:30:22.60 --> 00:30:31.24
It's one of those dichotomies is that people can be so ignorant to things and yet so

730
00:30:31.24 --> 00:30:32.72
perceptive to things.

731
00:30:32.72 --> 00:30:38.24
And the things like that, they're so perceptive to echo doesn't like to see Joko out

732
00:30:38.24 --> 00:30:39.24
shine him.

733
00:30:39.24 --> 00:30:40.68
That's why he's trying to hold them back.

734
00:30:40.68 --> 00:30:42.32
Oh, he's not sending him on that trip.

735
00:30:42.32 --> 00:30:44.24
We're just going to win that deal.

736
00:30:44.24 --> 00:30:46.44
Oh, he's going to go instead.

737
00:30:46.44 --> 00:30:48.64
Hey, I won the deal guys.

738
00:30:48.64 --> 00:30:49.64
Yeah, I'm great.

739
00:30:49.64 --> 00:30:50.64
No, wrong.

740
00:30:50.64 --> 00:30:55.72
And even down to the small little things like, you know, hey, you know, I don't know.

741
00:30:55.72 --> 00:30:58.36
We'll say, John is a guy's your subordinate.

742
00:30:58.36 --> 00:31:01.48
You're jealous of him because he's dope.

743
00:31:01.48 --> 00:31:05.96
When someone gives John a compliment about how good he did, just a little looking on your

744
00:31:05.96 --> 00:31:06.96
face.

745
00:31:06.96 --> 00:31:07.96
So obvious.

746
00:31:07.96 --> 00:31:08.96
You don't know.

747
00:31:08.96 --> 00:31:12.60
And you know how you say some people or people are so like ignorant of some things

748
00:31:12.60 --> 00:31:15.56
and so perceptive, they're ignorant about the stuff when it plays to them.

749
00:31:15.56 --> 00:31:16.56
Yeah.

750
00:31:16.56 --> 00:31:20.000
Somebody else is like, yeah, you know what I'm going to point those out all day.

751
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.48
Good point.

752
00:31:21.48 --> 00:31:25.48
Like when people in the I got this Sam Harris, he point he had this example where

753
00:31:25.48 --> 00:31:30.24
name dropping when you're, you know, when you do some name dropping, not everyone, but

754
00:31:30.24 --> 00:31:34.16
most people, it's like it's easier to recognize the one other people name dropping when

755
00:31:34.16 --> 00:31:35.16
they do them.

756
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:36.48
So, you know, so funny.

757
00:31:36.48 --> 00:31:38.16
So chill.

758
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:44.24
And there's, if I name drop, I immediately feel like a flush of just disgust.

759
00:31:44.24 --> 00:31:45.24
Yeah, I know.

760
00:31:45.24 --> 00:31:47.08
God, I just did that.

761
00:31:47.08 --> 00:31:48.08
That's so bad.

762
00:31:48.08 --> 00:31:49.08
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

763
00:31:49.08 --> 00:31:50.08
So bad.

764
00:31:50.08 --> 00:31:51.08
But it's hard to kind of know.

765
00:31:51.08 --> 00:31:54.72
Oh, you know, you know, speaking of how it was just texting back and forth with Tim

766
00:31:54.72 --> 00:31:56.36
Ferris and Joe Rogan the other day.

767
00:31:56.36 --> 00:32:03.88
That's a, you know, that's an excessive name drop when you say the first end of

768
00:32:03.88 --> 00:32:04.88
last video.

769
00:32:04.88 --> 00:32:05.88
That's it.

770
00:32:05.88 --> 00:32:08.88
You know, and then, well, I don't know, what's worse, like, Hey, I was just texting

771
00:32:08.88 --> 00:32:09.88
I just got a text from Tim.

772
00:32:09.88 --> 00:32:10.88
You know what?

773
00:32:10.88 --> 00:32:11.88
Yeah, you're right.

774
00:32:11.88 --> 00:32:14.24
Tim, who Tim Ferris, what?

775
00:32:14.24 --> 00:32:15.24
Joe Rogan, my boy.

776
00:32:15.24 --> 00:32:16.60
Yeah, we were kicking it out.

777
00:32:16.60 --> 00:32:17.60
Cool.

778
00:32:17.60 --> 00:32:22.60
Yeah, that's like, like, pseudo advanced name dropping where you say the first name

779
00:32:22.60 --> 00:32:23.60
like that.

780
00:32:23.60 --> 00:32:26.24
But like, like amateur name dropping is first and last name.

781
00:32:26.24 --> 00:32:27.24
Okay.

782
00:32:27.24 --> 00:32:28.84
So I was actually black belt name dropping.

783
00:32:28.84 --> 00:32:29.84
Yeah.

784
00:32:29.84 --> 00:32:31.48
Just first name, first name base.

785
00:32:31.48 --> 00:32:32.48
Yeah.

786
00:32:32.48 --> 00:32:35.64
Actually, more like one straight white belt, you know, it's just a little bit more

787
00:32:35.64 --> 00:32:36.64
expensive.

788
00:32:36.64 --> 00:32:37.64
Still name dropping.

789
00:32:37.64 --> 00:32:38.64
What's the height?

790
00:32:38.64 --> 00:32:40.76
Is there a way to appropriately name drop somehow?

791
00:32:40.76 --> 00:32:41.76
How do you do that?

792
00:32:41.76 --> 00:32:44.48
I'm sure they're not say their name.

793
00:32:44.48 --> 00:32:46.08
I was talking to someone the other day.

794
00:32:46.08 --> 00:32:47.88
So this is a similar situation.

795
00:32:47.88 --> 00:32:52.36
I was talking to, you know, met some people the other day and, and the girl says,

796
00:32:52.36 --> 00:32:56.20
you know, oh, yeah, and we're talking about the East Coast and she's, oh, yeah, I

797
00:32:56.20 --> 00:33:00.44
went to college and Cambridge and it was, you know, it's a good place.

798
00:33:00.44 --> 00:33:04.40
And I was thinking myself, I didn't, you know, oh, where'd you go to school?

799
00:33:04.40 --> 00:33:06.20
No, we'll leave it at that.

800
00:33:06.20 --> 00:33:07.84
But that was sort of a high level.

801
00:33:07.84 --> 00:33:08.84
Yeah.

802
00:33:08.84 --> 00:33:09.84
I lived in Cambridge.

803
00:33:09.84 --> 00:33:10.84
That's why I went to college.

804
00:33:10.84 --> 00:33:11.84
Yeah, yeah.

805
00:33:11.84 --> 00:33:14.84
I'm going for college to talk about going on there, right?

806
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:15.84
Right?

807
00:33:15.84 --> 00:33:18.76
So, you know, was that a high level?

808
00:33:18.76 --> 00:33:19.76
Was it?

809
00:33:19.76 --> 00:33:20.76
Was that just an honest conversation?

810
00:33:20.76 --> 00:33:21.76
Yeah.

811
00:33:21.76 --> 00:33:28.76
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

812
00:33:28.76 --> 00:33:29.76
you know, right?

813
00:33:29.76 --> 00:33:34.08
She didn't essentially want a name drop for the reason that people normally name

814
00:33:34.08 --> 00:33:35.08
drop.

815
00:33:35.08 --> 00:33:41.72
But here's, I think there is a way to like effectively and like legitimately if for like

816
00:33:41.72 --> 00:33:44.32
a better name drop.

817
00:33:44.32 --> 00:33:48.76
And that's like if you, if you, because name dropping typically, it's like, you know,

818
00:33:48.76 --> 00:33:52.72
it's almost like a week attempt at breezy and over, you know,

819
00:33:52.72 --> 00:33:58.48
who are I'm texting with Joe Rogan, you know, or they'll like say their little credentials.

820
00:33:58.48 --> 00:34:03.76
You know, but I think if you say, you know, how's texting with my friend and it was actually

821
00:34:03.76 --> 00:34:08.76
Joe Rogan, you know, and you make it like a point to emphasize like that, that, that, that,

822
00:34:08.76 --> 00:34:09.76
this wasn't just anyone.

823
00:34:09.76 --> 00:34:10.76
It was Joe Rogan.

824
00:34:10.76 --> 00:34:11.76
You're actually excited about it.

825
00:34:11.76 --> 00:34:12.76
Yes, you know, exactly.

826
00:34:12.76 --> 00:34:17.16
So that, I think that's an effective way because it kind of kind of can maintain your humility

827
00:34:17.16 --> 00:34:18.16
there.

828
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:21.76
We were like, you know, just texting with my boy Joe Rogan, whatever kind of thing.

829
00:34:21.76 --> 00:34:23.16
More like I'm just, no, just deal.

830
00:34:23.16 --> 00:34:24.16
No big deal.

831
00:34:24.16 --> 00:34:25.16
Let's be.

832
00:34:25.16 --> 00:34:28.16
Yeah, in me, Tiva.

833
00:34:28.16 --> 00:34:30.16
Anyway, go.

834
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:32.16
We, I digress.

835
00:34:32.16 --> 00:34:33.16
There.

836
00:34:33.16 --> 00:34:35.16
All right.

837
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:37.16
Next question.

838
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:42.16
What would be a good approach to effectively.

839
00:34:42.16 --> 00:34:47.36
What would be a good approach to effectively leading a team where instead of taking ownership

840
00:34:47.36 --> 00:34:51.36
of their responsibilities and working towards team goals, each team member is just trying

841
00:34:51.36 --> 00:34:52.36
to be the boss.

842
00:34:52.36 --> 00:34:53.36
Okay.

843
00:34:53.36 --> 00:34:56.36
So a couple things here.

844
00:34:56.36 --> 00:34:59.36
You want to let them be the boss of their tasks, right?

845
00:34:59.36 --> 00:35:00.36
That's what you're trying to do.

846
00:35:00.36 --> 00:35:02.36
So that, that makes sense.

847
00:35:02.36 --> 00:35:05.36
And one of the ways, if they, if they, if they want to be the boss of everything,

848
00:35:05.36 --> 00:35:09.36
maybe you give them a little bit more as much decision making process, you can, as to

849
00:35:09.36 --> 00:35:13.36
what task or what projects they're in charge of, so that makes them feel a little bit like

850
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:14.36
their empowered.

851
00:35:14.36 --> 00:35:16.36
And I shouldn't say, makes them feel like they're empowered.

852
00:35:16.36 --> 00:35:17.36
You actually are empowered.

853
00:35:17.36 --> 00:35:18.36
You know what I mean?

854
00:35:18.36 --> 00:35:23.36
So there's a, there's a pretty significant distinction, because once again, people will recognize,

855
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:26.36
if you're just letting them do it to make them feel good about it, they're going to know that.

856
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:27.36
Yeah.

857
00:35:27.36 --> 00:35:28.36
Okay, Jocco.

858
00:35:28.36 --> 00:35:29.36
Thanks for the decision.

859
00:35:29.36 --> 00:35:30.36
You gave me a choice of one thing.

860
00:35:30.36 --> 00:35:31.36
Thank you.

861
00:35:31.36 --> 00:35:32.36
The color of the hands.

862
00:35:32.36 --> 00:35:33.36
Yeah.

863
00:35:33.36 --> 00:35:42.36
So, so, you know, maybe let them really express their authority and leadership on owning what it is that

864
00:35:42.36 --> 00:35:43.36
they're owning.

865
00:35:43.36 --> 00:35:47.16
But the question says, they're not taking ownership of their responsibilities.

866
00:35:47.16 --> 00:35:52.96
So let's make sure first that we're not, that we're giving them full reign and full ownership

867
00:35:52.96 --> 00:35:55.36
of their responsibilities and we're not micromanaging in there.

868
00:35:55.36 --> 00:36:03.36
Now, if that, if we're beyond that and we got people that just want to be in charge of a whole thing.

869
00:36:03.36 --> 00:36:04.36
Well, cool.

870
00:36:04.36 --> 00:36:06.36
That's, that's actually awesome.

871
00:36:06.36 --> 00:36:07.36
You want to be in charge of everything.

872
00:36:07.36 --> 00:36:11.36
If Echo is in our team and you want to be in charge of everything, hey, guys, check it out.

873
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:15.36
Right now, this next, you know, project that we're working, Echo is going to run it.

874
00:36:15.36 --> 00:36:23.36
I'm going to sit back and by the way, next project, Bill, you're running and next project Fred, you're running.

875
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:27.36
Now we're all going to get to actually get in the hotseed and eat you.

876
00:36:27.36 --> 00:36:29.36
And I'll tell you what, you're going to see number one.

877
00:36:29.36 --> 00:36:32.36
You're going to see some people go, ah, you, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

878
00:36:32.36 --> 00:36:36.36
They wanted to sit in the back and chirp, but they don't actually want to be responsible for anything.

879
00:36:36.36 --> 00:36:38.36
So that puts them to rest right away.

880
00:36:38.36 --> 00:36:44.36
You're also what's gonna happen with everybody is they're all gonna see that this thing that looks so easy from the back of the room is a lot harder than they think

881
00:36:44.36 --> 00:36:48.20
That's what it's like running a seal mission the guy in the back that's never been in charge before

882
00:36:48.20 --> 00:36:50.20
We should just do it like this and

883
00:36:51.32 --> 00:36:56.84
That guy you say okay here you run this and then you know in six hours they come up and say hey

884
00:36:58.12 --> 00:37:03.000
Yeah, you can be ahead without we're supposed to contact and decomplect with these other units

885
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.16
Okay, it's a little tricky and you thought maybe isn't it

886
00:37:05.16 --> 00:37:10.64
Yeah, but you actually put people in charge of things if they want to be in charge of things put them in charge of things

887
00:37:10.64 --> 00:37:14.60
It's great and you know don't let them fall in your face don't let them get anyone killed don't let them

888
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.88
You know get anyone injured or losing a strategic

889
00:37:18.44 --> 00:37:20.44
ground we're not gonna do that

890
00:37:20.68 --> 00:37:25.40
But we're gonna let them have the opportunity to step up and lead if they do a good job

891
00:37:26.44 --> 00:37:27.44
Sweet

892
00:37:27.44 --> 00:37:32.16
Sweet now you've got them you can rely on them you can actually put them in charge of projects now you don't have to micromanage

893
00:37:32.16 --> 00:37:37.52
We don't have to watch over them. This is this is a no-loose situation this happened actually one of my one of my

894
00:37:37.76 --> 00:37:42.32
Patuna's going through training and one of the platoon commanders came up to me

895
00:37:42.32 --> 00:37:47.04
We were just putting them pulling up a tune through training and he comes up and he's oh my platoon chief wants to run everything

896
00:37:47.76 --> 00:37:51.52
And I said good let him run everything let him run everything that's perfect

897
00:37:51.52 --> 00:37:55.36
Then you can focus on you know other things don't worry about it

898
00:37:55.36 --> 00:38:04.40
But ego right we want to be running everything we want that we all I'm the guy in charge. Yeah, no let him run it and it's just

899
00:38:04.96 --> 00:38:11.24
It's it's the the reason the thing that holds people back from letting other people run things is insecurity

900
00:38:11.24 --> 00:38:16.000
Hmm if I think echo is gonna do a better job than me or I think you're gonna do a really good job

901
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.72
And you're gonna shine and I don't feel like I do a good job

902
00:38:18.72 --> 00:38:22.000
I'm gonna hold you back as the best of my ability. We like no echo

903
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.04
You're going you're going to stay in your lane. Yeah, I'm happy so we're here. No

904
00:38:27.76 --> 00:38:30.48
But if I if I know if I'm secure in my leadership

905
00:38:32.16 --> 00:38:36.28
Man echo oh you want to run this dude awesome here you go here's the plan

906
00:38:36.28 --> 00:38:39.76
Once you know here's the here's the portfolio why don't you put the plan together?

907
00:38:39.76 --> 00:38:44.72
I'm gonna be over here looking down road on the next project and looking for our next thing down the road

908
00:38:44.72 --> 00:38:49.20
Going out and getting another client to bring into the game. We're gonna make this happen. No factor

909
00:38:49.20 --> 00:38:55.04
Yeah, it seems like counterintuitive isn't it? Yeah, it is you want to you want me to say

910
00:38:55.04 --> 00:38:59.92
Who knows how you're keeping the people in their lanes? Yeah, I'm gonna tell you what you do let him out of their lanes

911
00:38:59.92 --> 00:39:02.48
Let him into your lane let him run some stuff

912
00:39:03.76 --> 00:39:06.32
Build a new leader to beautiful thing

913
00:39:07.68 --> 00:39:09.68
when

914
00:39:09.92 --> 00:39:14.64
You you know when you're insecure you want you don't want them to shout out shine you you know

915
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:17.92
You can tell that where I think it's natural though

916
00:39:17.92 --> 00:39:19.92
You know when people

917
00:39:19.92 --> 00:39:25.52
Maybe a little insecure you know or if you're not as good as maybe you hope or what I think it's natural be a little bit insecure of course

918
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:28.56
Here's how in my experience anyway

919
00:39:28.56 --> 00:39:33.28
We're I could tell where I'm being insecure where if someone's performing a certain thing and

920
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.80
You're kind of like you can feel it consciously you kind of hope that they don't do that good

921
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:41.92
But man that I know rats bad

922
00:39:41.92 --> 00:39:45.92
It's bad, but that's how you can tell that's how you can tell if you have that feeling

923
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:51.44
Oh, you should you should definitely you if you have that feeling check yourself. Yeah, I know what here

924
00:39:51.44 --> 00:39:55.68
I am hoping that my own team member. I know that's a good job

925
00:39:56.48 --> 00:40:04.32
Yeah, that's a bad situation real bad. You want to hope everyone's doing great. Yeah, and you know this happened on the planet and I talk about it in the book

926
00:40:04.48 --> 00:40:06.48
Extreme ownership was

927
00:40:07.04 --> 00:40:11.76
You know the Delta Patoon commander. He was worried that this element that had come into work in his a.o

928
00:40:11.76 --> 00:40:14.40
He was worried that they were gonna be better than him and take his job

929
00:40:14.40 --> 00:40:17.20
And he told me that that's it. Hey, bro

930
00:40:17.60 --> 00:40:24.56
If they take your job good, I'll find a new job for you. There's so much work we got work to do don't worry about it help them help them take your job

931
00:40:24.88 --> 00:40:26.88
And I'll find you a new job

932
00:40:26.88 --> 00:40:29.92
It turns out that there egos were too big and they couldn't let that happen

933
00:40:31.28 --> 00:40:33.28
But that's the same situation

934
00:40:33.28 --> 00:40:38.48
You got somebody that thinks gonna take your job and do better than you help them and then find new work

935
00:40:39.76 --> 00:40:43.04
Because because we're trying to help the team right there's a mission there's an overall mission

936
00:40:43.04 --> 00:40:47.36
And if echo can do something better than me hey here's the turnover here's the lessons

937
00:40:47.36 --> 00:40:52.16
I learned you're better at this than I am you keep running with it. I'm gonna go find something that I'm good at

938
00:40:52.72 --> 00:40:54.72
Or an area that I can help

939
00:40:55.36 --> 00:40:57.36
That's just supporting the whole team

940
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
It's a winner

941
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
So and you know what sitting

942
00:41:02.88 --> 00:41:06.64
In the podcast studio. It's so easy. Yeah talk about that

943
00:41:06.64 --> 00:41:14.16
Yeah, but it's so hard for people to do that. It really is really is yeah. So one of those things where you're dealing with your actual feelings in the situation

944
00:41:14.16 --> 00:41:19.28
We're not dealing with our actual feelings in the situation right now, but which but it doesn't that mean that it's

945
00:41:19.76 --> 00:41:25.60
That's good, you know you that we're you're giving a fresh like view you were yeah, you know you are detached

946
00:41:25.60 --> 00:41:33.28
I am the catch get accurate advice and the more detached and you pointed out some red flags right if I'm hoping that these guys go on the mission and fail

947
00:41:33.28 --> 00:41:40.88
That's a red flag that you're being selfish and insecure about your job and what you're doing and if someone can do it job better than you

948
00:41:41.52 --> 00:41:43.52
Let them do it

949
00:41:43.52 --> 00:41:45.52
That's gonna help the whole team

950
00:41:46.24 --> 00:41:48.96
Yeah, so it's like you're us in the podcast room

951
00:41:49.44 --> 00:41:51.60
We're like you know if you get a guy in the maze

952
00:41:52.64 --> 00:41:54.64
The maze of emotions and

953
00:41:54.64 --> 00:41:58.56
We're outside of the maze on top we can see the whole maze. We're not in the maze of emotions

954
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:01.12
We're on top we can look at the whole scenario the whole maze

955
00:42:01.12 --> 00:42:06.40
So we can tell that guy what to do effectively. Yes, you know echo you just described detachment

956
00:42:06.64 --> 00:42:10.72
There you go. That's what detachment is like that's what that's what that's what it's like for me

957
00:42:11.28 --> 00:42:15.60
I can see the maze and I remember learning how to step back

958
00:42:16.16 --> 00:42:18.72
And step above and look at the maze. I remember

959
00:42:19.28 --> 00:42:24.88
Remember learning that and going oh, that's all you gotta do yeah, and then I remember taking it from the training ground

960
00:42:24.88 --> 00:42:32.56
The battle field and then realizing that that's what you need to do in the everyday interactions with people and especially once I got on the business world

961
00:42:32.56 --> 00:42:33.52
Then I

962
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:38.80
The thing that was cool about when we started echelon front now I would be witnessing like I'd go into a meeting

963
00:42:39.60 --> 00:42:42.80
And I would be detached. I would be up above the maze

964
00:42:43.92 --> 00:42:45.92
Of emotions in turmoil

965
00:42:46.56 --> 00:42:48.56
And so now I would get to see it

966
00:42:48.88 --> 00:42:53.60
And then I would start bringing the leadership and saying look at what this looks like to me. Yeah, they'd go go

967
00:42:53.60 --> 00:43:00.32
I don't like that. I don't like that one to the video. Yeah, go into the video and and so then that's how you learn

968
00:43:00.56 --> 00:43:06.48
We go to the video look what it looks like from up above the maze and now you see you see what you were doing here in your meeting

969
00:43:06.80 --> 00:43:08.80
You had everybody so

970
00:43:08.72 --> 00:43:15.12
Intimidated that no one said anything you just gave a 15 minute meeting no one responded in any way to anything

971
00:43:15.12 --> 00:43:18.32
You said you think everyone in that room agreed with everything you said not a chance

972
00:43:18.56 --> 00:43:22.96
They didn't say work. Why is that you intimidated them you bullied them and now you're not getting any feedback

973
00:43:22.96 --> 00:43:28.08
And they're gonna execute the plan that they don't believe in and that's probably less effective than the one that they have coming from the field

974
00:43:28.40 --> 00:43:32.08
Yeah, congratulations congratulations no not congratulations

975
00:43:32.56 --> 00:43:34.56
Let's get this up

976
00:43:34.56 --> 00:43:36.56
Like you know

977
00:43:36.56 --> 00:43:39.36
So I was in the in traffic

978
00:43:40.24 --> 00:43:42.24
And something to think about

979
00:43:42.96 --> 00:43:47.36
I was in traffic and you know how the you have the two lanes right so I'm gonna turn left on the light

980
00:43:47.84 --> 00:43:49.84
Yeah, then the lane next to me they're going straight

981
00:43:49.84 --> 00:43:55.52
So whoever the person in front of the person that was next to me both went straight

982
00:43:56.56 --> 00:43:58.08
They were taking too long

983
00:43:58.08 --> 00:44:04.80
So the lady next song in the horn all credit like oh going like this all crazy so of course I look over at and she's going crazy

984
00:44:05.60 --> 00:44:09.84
She looks over at me she's like like do you believe this kind of thing all going nuts mean

985
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:11.44
When I'm looking at myself

986
00:44:11.44 --> 00:44:12.24
You know

987
00:44:12.24 --> 00:44:15.52
Other people around me there are just like what this lady is going nuts, you know

988
00:44:15.52 --> 00:44:23.12
So that's an example of being on the outside looking in her she thought it was justifiable honk of the horn looking nuts

989
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.28
But meanwhile we're on that so I'd looking at her like, right you know how you look and you know what that situation is you

990
00:44:30.16 --> 00:44:32.16
Didn't have anywhere to be

991
00:44:32.16 --> 00:44:33.52
She did well

992
00:44:33.52 --> 00:44:42.48
Then her head like she was you know, I'm saying though she's a person that had left for late work late as you was gonna be in trouble and blah, blah, blah

993
00:44:42.48 --> 00:44:48.96
And that that 30 set that that 10 second that eight seconds. Yeah, it was probably like three was an eternity for her

994
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:52.96
Yeah, she just is going nuts just like I'll talk about the airport if I'm running late for the flight

995
00:44:52.96 --> 00:44:58.28
TSA takes five minutes it could be no factor or it could drive me completely insane

996
00:44:58.28 --> 00:45:04.16
You know and that's that was her and you know what these days when I screw something up

997
00:45:04.16 --> 00:45:07.52
I don't get frustrated like that. You know that's what we're talking about the first question

998
00:45:07.52 --> 00:45:08.72
I'm like oh my god

999
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:14.64
I look at myself and go I can't believe I left late. Yeah, do this. I'm I'm an idiot. Yeah, I won't let that happen again

1000
00:45:14.64 --> 00:45:18.000
I said that in 1996 and I haven't let it happen

1001
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:22.80
See the mean though I was outside the maze

1002
00:45:22.80 --> 00:45:24.80
Yeah, I know she's feeling

1003
00:45:25.36 --> 00:45:27.92
Oh these guys not going go green light go

1004
00:45:28.48 --> 00:45:33.60
It's time to go universal yeah, so I understand the feeling but look how you look from the outside, you know

1005
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.04
Did she check herself at all? No when she saw you know

1006
00:45:37.04 --> 00:45:42.96
She looked at to me for some emotional support. Yeah, as if you believe this guy, you know get

1007
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:46.32
Crazy with me kind of think that was the look

1008
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:51.20
Yeah, man, so I think that's I think that's another

1009
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:58.88
Understand the difference between feeling in behavior as well, you know like I feel I know that's a frustrating thing it can be

1010
00:45:59.68 --> 00:46:01.68
But don't behave like that calm down

1011
00:46:02.48 --> 00:46:04.48
person next question

1012
00:46:04.48 --> 00:46:11.44
What have you learned about yourself or learn in general over the course of the last 70 plus podcast

1013
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:14.96
So

1014
00:46:14.96 --> 00:46:20.64
The the biggest thing that I learned have learned in the past 70 podcasts is that I have a lot more to learn

1015
00:46:21.84 --> 00:46:29.60
That's what I learned and the amount of information out there that will help us get better and smarter and more effective as humans

1016
00:46:29.76 --> 00:46:32.40
The amount of information is is pretty boundless

1017
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:34.40
and also

1018
00:46:34.96 --> 00:46:36.96
You also see

1019
00:46:36.96 --> 00:46:41.56
the repetitive themes that we see over and over again that

1020
00:46:42.56 --> 00:46:45.12
Constantly come up and reinforce themselves now

1021
00:46:46.08 --> 00:46:48.08
with that I

1022
00:46:48.08 --> 00:46:52.64
Think that seeing these repetitive themes, but each with its own little angle

1023
00:46:53.76 --> 00:47:01.76
Give I have given me a better I don't want to say a better understanding, but I guess I don't know what other word to use a more

1024
00:47:01.76 --> 00:47:03.76
granular understanding of

1025
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:09.60
Human nature and of leadership and of war and of life

1026
00:47:10.96 --> 00:47:12.96
Because you get to

1027
00:47:12.96 --> 00:47:16.000
Nothing teaches better than experience, but you can't experience

1028
00:47:17.04 --> 00:47:20.80
a thousand years of life in reality, but through

1029
00:47:21.52 --> 00:47:25.20
Leading and understanding and seeing what other people have gone through

1030
00:47:26.16 --> 00:47:30.08
You do get some level of experience and I know you just went to

1031
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:34.16
You just did the FTX with with

1032
00:47:34.16 --> 00:47:37.44
Ashillon front you went to the shoots video with life in JP and

1033
00:47:38.24 --> 00:47:41.28
For those of you that don't know, Ashillon front we do

1034
00:47:42.48 --> 00:47:44.80
Leadership and management consulting and sometimes we do

1035
00:47:45.52 --> 00:47:52.32
Feel training exercise where we take people out and we teach them how to shoot and we teach in fundamental tactics of fire maneuvering

1036
00:47:52.32 --> 00:47:58.88
Then we give the missions to accomplish and so you know you you I know you just went out to do your first one and when you got back

1037
00:47:58.88 --> 00:48:04.48
You know you said I kind of felt a little bit of what it's like to be in a firefight and then you kind of backed off

1038
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:07.76
You like well, no, I didn't I didn't you know, I'm not trying to say that and I said no actually

1039
00:48:08.72 --> 00:48:13.68
You did feel a little bit of what it is like to be in a firefight because you saw people maneuvering and you

1040
00:48:13.68 --> 00:48:18.48
You were getting hit with with plastic rounds that hurt and you knew you need to get down

1041
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:25.76
And you saw the people getting frustrated and you saw people getting fustered that's that is is it exactly like combat? No and there's also a

1042
00:48:25.76 --> 00:48:32.16
You know that the step up to real combat is huge because now you're gonna die if you screw up

1043
00:48:32.80 --> 00:48:38.16
But there is a glimpse and there is a there is a a certain level of

1044
00:48:38.24 --> 00:48:42.56
Understanding that you absolutely gain from those scenarios that you're put into

1045
00:48:43.12 --> 00:48:48.32
And it's the same thing when you read a book and you read it the right way and you gather the information from it

1046
00:48:48.72 --> 00:48:51.36
You you don't have the experience itself

1047
00:48:51.36 --> 00:48:56.08
But there's no doubt you can learn from it so I think for me that's

1048
00:48:57.20 --> 00:49:02.80
That's the biggest thing is really reading with a lot of intent to pull lessons out

1049
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:07.36
Seeing the multiple lessons seeing the different things from different angles and I've talked about this before

1050
00:49:07.36 --> 00:49:11.20
You know when you learn an arm lock from seven different instructors

1051
00:49:11.20 --> 00:49:15.84
They each teach you something a little bit different and something that works in some detail that you didn't see

1052
00:49:15.84 --> 00:49:24.24
And then on top of that when you learn an arm lock from the bottom and from the top and from the garden from the close garden from the open garden from this cross side and from the mountain

1053
00:49:24.24 --> 00:49:28.56
You every one of those different angles that you learn it from you get better

1054
00:49:28.56 --> 00:49:32.56
You get each one of those angles makes you better at the other angles too

1055
00:49:33.28 --> 00:49:36.64
So I think that's the biggest thing for me is just

1056
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:44.08
Learning how much I didn't know and then taking what I can bring on board and assimilating it into my

1057
00:49:44.08 --> 00:49:51.04
View and understanding like I said my view and understanding of the world of human nature of war

1058
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:54.16
And of life

1059
00:49:54.16 --> 00:49:57.20
Yeah, it's been it's been fun for me and educational

1060
00:49:58.16 --> 00:50:04.000
I agree I think I mean obviously I approach this thing from a different position

1061
00:50:04.72 --> 00:50:06.72
but

1062
00:50:06.72 --> 00:50:08.40
You know the no complaining

1063
00:50:08.40 --> 00:50:10.72
Think or people like no complaining

1064
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:16.08
I think that really got reinforced in me. It's one of those things where what is it?

1065
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:21.44
Who said it? Yola where he says either do or do not there is no try so a little bit different and see either you do it

1066
00:50:21.44 --> 00:50:27.04
Yeah, you know said that and from the Star Wars series in part sure expect you okay do or do not

1067
00:50:27.52 --> 00:50:29.52
There is no try got it

1068
00:50:29.92 --> 00:50:37.76
He said a lot of other cool shit, but nonetheless when you know when you're tasked with something or you're I don't know wife

1069
00:50:37.76 --> 00:50:43.68
Ask you to do something or whatever either do it or you don't do it. Don't do it and complain about it the whole time

1070
00:50:43.76 --> 00:50:46.16
You know where the and that's a common thing where is a car?

1071
00:50:46.16 --> 00:50:49.92
I don't do it and then they'll do it then they'll complain about while they're doing it or after they do it

1072
00:50:50.48 --> 00:50:53.28
Or before they or before during ad after that, you know

1073
00:50:53.52 --> 00:50:57.44
So it's one of those things where and don't even complain in here. This is I'm just saying this is what I've kind of learned

1074
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:01.44
Overall and it's it's weird because this wasn't necessarily a specific lesson

1075
00:51:02.96 --> 00:51:06.24
But it's just it kind of just gets incorporated into your brain where

1076
00:51:06.24 --> 00:51:08.24
You just kind of

1077
00:51:08.80 --> 00:51:13.04
Don't even complain in your own head, you know, you know when you when you yeah, I don't know sweet

1078
00:51:13.04 --> 00:51:14.32
I don't know you're like

1079
00:51:14.32 --> 00:51:18.48
I can't believe I'm sweeping the floor. What about all this other stuff that I do and all this that don't even do that?

1080
00:51:18.88 --> 00:51:23.28
You know, okay, I'm tasked with just like how you it was you regard you compared it to

1081
00:51:24.40 --> 00:51:28.32
Doing paperwork. They're like yeah, but yeah good. You don't want to do paperwork

1082
00:51:28.32 --> 00:51:33.44
No one to do paperwork. You do paperwork. Yeah, but you do the paperwork and you do that and you

1083
00:51:33.44 --> 00:51:36.72
Crush it as you say you do that paperwork the best you can

1084
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:45.36
So man if I get to sweep the floor I got to you know wash dishes. I got to whatever

1085
00:51:45.36 --> 00:51:51.28
Watch I'm gonna do this the best I can. What in fact take pride in that you know take pride not necessarily even in

1086
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.76
Washing of the dishes. I said yeah, I take pride in that, but not necessarily just that take pride in the fact that you're the guy

1087
00:51:58.16 --> 00:52:02.08
Who can wash the dishes that good? You know depend on me. Hell yeah. I can do that

1088
00:52:02.08 --> 00:52:04.08
Give me more stuff. I'll do it more

1089
00:52:04.56 --> 00:52:08.40
I mean, I'd say that last part because you have other things to do sometimes, but

1090
00:52:08.72 --> 00:52:13.20
Saying anything your task with do it the best you can't for I mean that even sounds kind of cliche like oh

1091
00:52:13.20 --> 00:52:19.60
I've heard that just do everything but to really have that happen kind of in your mind where you regard it all your tasks

1092
00:52:19.60 --> 00:52:23.12
Whether you like or not that way where you can do it best you can it's

1093
00:52:23.76 --> 00:52:26.08
That's that's a life improving

1094
00:52:26.08 --> 00:52:31.92
Situation yeah, yeah, and going back to what I was so I just thought this while you were talking

1095
00:52:32.72 --> 00:52:34.16
General Mattis

1096
00:52:34.16 --> 00:52:38.80
He he said the other day there's an article about him because he's extremely well read and

1097
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:43.84
He has a personal library of seven thousand books

1098
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:50.40
Very smart very well educated very well read, but what he said is very similar to what I said

1099
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:53.76
He said you know I wouldn't get I'm not gonna get surprised

1100
00:52:53.76 --> 00:52:59.76
Because what I'm gonna face on the battlefield someone else is faced before and he made a couple comparisons

1101
00:52:59.76 --> 00:53:03.28
I can't think of him off the top of my head, but you know when I saw this when he you know

1102
00:53:03.28 --> 00:53:08.32
He said when I saw this for the first time I remembered this historical situation when I saw that for the first time

1103
00:53:08.32 --> 00:53:13.52
I remembered this historical situation so I never was surprised

1104
00:53:14.40 --> 00:53:18.48
By what I was seeing because I had seen it before maybe only the book

1105
00:53:18.96 --> 00:53:23.12
But at least you have a heads up and that's what you're looking for and

1106
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:30.56
What's cool is if you extrapolate the war which is what we're doing on this podcast taking the war piece of it

1107
00:53:31.12 --> 00:53:36.24
And extrapolating the human nature piece of it and that's gonna give you a broad look at the way people act

1108
00:53:36.72 --> 00:53:39.68
the way humans act and interact and

1109
00:53:39.92 --> 00:53:41.92
That's what I think has been

1110
00:53:42.72 --> 00:53:49.92
Really good for me to just really the other thing is when you you know when you teach it to do to move and you get better at it

1111
00:53:49.92 --> 00:53:57.60
Just by teaching it and you understand it more well for me by writing the notes and putting them in the podcast and then

1112
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:02.24
Thinking about which direction I'm gonna go and what I'm gonna talk about. I've learned it better

1113
00:54:02.48 --> 00:54:07.92
You know, I've become things that used to things that I may have known instinctively before and done for 10 years

1114
00:54:07.92 --> 00:54:10.40
Just like when we wrote extreme ownership there was things in there that I said

1115
00:54:11.28 --> 00:54:15.36
You know as was writing what happened? I'm like, oh, yeah, I did a hear I used to do it there

1116
00:54:15.36 --> 00:54:17.76
This is where I learned it, but I never really thought about it

1117
00:54:17.76 --> 00:54:23.92
Until and even going beat before that when I took over the training for the West Coast you'll teams

1118
00:54:25.12 --> 00:54:29.36
I would with the first time I wrote down the laws of combat the four fundamental laws of combat

1119
00:54:30.96 --> 00:54:35.68
I had known those I had I had acted that I had performed them for years

1120
00:54:36.16 --> 00:54:43.60
I had never written them down until I took over training and saw a platoon and said these guys aren't doing these things that would make them successful

1121
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:48.88
Boom, I wrote them down that was it and once I wrote them down and sort of talk about them and show guys

1122
00:54:48.96 --> 00:54:54.08
They made even more sense and I saw them even easier when people would make a mistake

1123
00:54:55.04 --> 00:55:00.40
So it's I think it's that's what's been good for me is it's been a real great mental exercise

1124
00:55:02.08 --> 00:55:08.08
So thanks everyone for listening and making me do this podcast once a week whether I like it or not

1125
00:55:09.20 --> 00:55:11.20
And actually yeah, and that's another thing

1126
00:55:11.20 --> 00:55:22.08
Where you know we almost went to one podcast every two weeks and and so I was just talking to a buddy mind that's in a company that

1127
00:55:23.44 --> 00:55:27.92
I was talking about he was that one of the few guys when we I kind of was thinking about this idea of

1128
00:55:28.64 --> 00:55:34.48
Of you know going to one podcast every two weeks and we were driving the same as Mike and great guy

1129
00:55:35.20 --> 00:55:39.12
Great leader and we're driving and I and I said hey, you know

1130
00:55:39.12 --> 00:55:43.68
I'm just we were driving to go do some work. I was working with his company and I said you know

1131
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:47.20
I'm thinking about you know, maybe doing the podcast once every two weeks instead of once a week

1132
00:55:48.56 --> 00:55:52.32
And he was driving and I was just the passenger and also you know he just kind of

1133
00:55:53.04 --> 00:55:55.04
He said hey, you know

1134
00:55:55.52 --> 00:55:57.52
I just

1135
00:55:57.52 --> 00:55:58.32
I

1136
00:55:58.32 --> 00:55:59.92
Don't think that's a good idea

1137
00:56:00.64 --> 00:56:05.28
I thought you know and he was really he said look, you know, you can't do that

1138
00:56:05.28 --> 00:56:09.20
You know really we're listening to the podcast. We expected to come out on Wednesday

1139
00:56:09.20 --> 00:56:10.000
It's got to come out on Wednesday

1140
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.12
I think he was like okay any compromise at least is look if you're gonna do it

1141
00:56:13.44 --> 00:56:18.08
Then you need to you know you need to give us a more like a six month warning so people can start to get used to and

1142
00:56:18.56 --> 00:56:23.92
That was one of the things that swayed me to say you know what I need to start keep hold the line on the podcast

1143
00:56:23.92 --> 00:56:25.92
That was the other thing what it was hard

1144
00:56:26.48 --> 00:56:32.16
Okay, hey, Jocco mr sitting around saying hey, if it's hard to do it anyways

1145
00:56:32.16 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah, I was it was kind of hard so it was gonna get out of it. Yeah, no hold the line Jocco. I'm talking to you Jocco

1146
00:56:39.44 --> 00:56:43.84
Practice what you preach you know what I mean yeah, it's always hard you got to read a book and you got to

1147
00:56:43.84 --> 00:56:46.80
Unlearn take something. Oh, so what do it anyways?

1148
00:56:47.44 --> 00:56:49.44
Bring it

1149
00:56:50.32 --> 00:56:56.12
It's true. It's like Mike for the podcast continually coming out on once a week

1150
00:56:56.12 --> 00:57:00.76
No, they're really a thing like but it um it

1151
00:57:01.48 --> 00:57:07.96
One of the other things kind of like what you're saying is I gonna go is um you kind of either do it and get it done

1152
00:57:08.60 --> 00:57:11.000
Like this is what a person in my experience

1153
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.92
Be from experience where you know like you'll ask about about something like hey, what's the status on this or that

1154
00:57:16.92 --> 00:57:20.84
So it's either done or it's not done like where you can be

1155
00:57:20.84 --> 00:57:25.64
You know, I would have done that but you know, I did all this stuff all that stuff after you said

1156
00:57:25.64 --> 00:57:29.88
I would have done that but like that doesn't matter at all either you did it or you didn't do it either

1157
00:57:29.88 --> 00:57:38.44
You were like you know kind of like how it says you either effective or you ineffective kind of thing and the more and I think it's has a lot to do with just hanging around you more where

1158
00:57:39.72 --> 00:57:46.28
I tell you about something and you'd be like okay is this done or whatever is this about to be done or where are we on this and then I'll say

1159
00:57:46.28 --> 00:57:49.08
Oh, yeah, it's done then it's like okay. You have this kind of look of okay

1160
00:57:49.08 --> 00:57:51.08
Like solid like thumbs up kind of thing

1161
00:57:51.08 --> 00:57:57.32
But if I say no, I know I know because of this right when I go into because you have this kind of weird haze that goes over you like you don't care

1162
00:57:57.32 --> 00:58:01.16
You're nice you're nice well and you're not like woo, what do you mean?

1163
00:58:01.16 --> 00:58:06.84
You're not like that at all, but I can see the little haze go over you like you don't care at all about these excuses

1164
00:58:06.84 --> 00:58:10.20
That I'm about to say or these justifications that I'm ready to make quite well

1165
00:58:10.60 --> 00:58:11.56
Yeah

1166
00:58:11.56 --> 00:58:13.56
So and that was early on now

1167
00:58:13.56 --> 00:58:20.12
I just know it's automatic it's either the answer is yes or no and if it's no and it should have been done then next time

1168
00:58:20.12 --> 00:58:23.88
I see it should be done and that applies to everything and I make the analogy where

1169
00:58:24.28 --> 00:58:29.08
Nothing out the story where my brother would be like hey, buy me some wine. I'm like wine you ever been into wine section

1170
00:58:29.56 --> 00:58:31.08
Brought you to huge

1171
00:58:31.08 --> 00:58:34.60
Give me this wine. It's called this called this you know to the cabernet

1172
00:58:34.60 --> 00:58:38.44
I don't know whatever you call that that should be like the beef jerky section

1173
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.56
That's how big the beef jerky section yeah, bro

1174
00:58:41.56 --> 00:58:47.80
Yeah, it should be but no as of now it's wine and if you go in there and he wants some specific wine

1175
00:58:48.36 --> 00:58:52.36
It's easy to go in there and be like you know what this wine section is too vast

1176
00:58:52.36 --> 00:58:57.24
I'm either gonna grab any wine like I see and that's it or I'm not gonna get it

1177
00:58:57.24 --> 00:58:59.92
Tass me with this big tab. I'm just going in here to get some

1178
00:58:59.92 --> 00:59:07.40
Lidges and you know you got me treasure hunting in the wine section and so I'm not gonna do that, but I

1179
00:59:07.40 --> 00:59:11.80
Had it in my mind that I'm like no, I mean you want some wine you want this one all right

1180
00:59:11.80 --> 00:59:13.88
Well, I'm gonna get it so cuz when I come home

1181
00:59:13.88 --> 00:59:19.32
I'm playing around yeah when I come home either I got the wine or I didn't get the wine and you don't want to be the guy who didn't get the wine

1182
00:59:19.88 --> 00:59:23.40
No matter what your excuse is I'm telling you bro

1183
00:59:23.40 --> 00:59:26.36
I apply that to everything apply that to something important, you know

1184
00:59:27.24 --> 00:59:29.24
Jays wine is important

1185
00:59:29.24 --> 00:59:31.24
So unimportant

1186
00:59:31.24 --> 00:59:32.68
Jesus

1187
00:59:32.68 --> 00:59:34.44
nonetheless yeah all good things

1188
00:59:34.44 --> 00:59:40.76
We got from this podcast I think I would concur next question

1189
00:59:42.04 --> 00:59:46.60
Does the you know what else is cool about this podcast is people that here and from people

1190
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:51.24
That have done made some awesome progress

1191
00:59:51.24 --> 00:59:55.88
Yeah, and that's awesome that that's that's that is actually the best thing about the podcast

1192
00:59:55.88 --> 00:59:59.24
Yeah, is here and from people out in the field that

1193
01:00:00.04 --> 01:00:03.24
Got promoted got a new job move to a leadership position

1194
01:00:03.24 --> 01:00:09.08
in lost 72 pounds gained 12 pounds of bleed muscle mass

1195
01:00:09.64 --> 01:00:11.64
You know whatever those

1196
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.32
Whatever the achievement was I talked to guy the other day

1197
01:00:16.92 --> 01:00:22.28
That that stopped abiding his nails right like you don't think much of it

1198
01:00:22.84 --> 01:00:29.24
But he said he bit his nails for you know 34 straight years and tried the little

1199
01:00:29.24 --> 01:00:36.12
Nail polish that goes on there and you know you you go to the hypnotists and you go to all these different things no and you know what you know

1200
01:00:36.12 --> 01:00:39.56
And you finally said I'm not gonna bite my nails anymore right not gonna do it

1201
01:00:40.60 --> 01:00:42.60
I'm gonna impose my will yeah

1202
01:00:43.16 --> 01:00:47.48
And then you're done yeah, so here and everybody that does that kind of thing is awesome

1203
01:00:47.72 --> 01:00:52.60
That's definitely the most that so I guess I'm going into not what I learned right this the general

1204
01:00:53.08 --> 01:00:54.12
overall

1205
01:00:54.12 --> 01:01:00.04
World of the podcast is to talk to people that have made some significant

1206
01:01:01.40 --> 01:01:10.52
Progress in their life and they attribute that progress to listening to podcast which I always reattribute when they come and about it back to them

1207
01:01:11.16 --> 01:01:13.40
Because I didn't stop biting your nails

1208
01:01:14.68 --> 01:01:20.28
72 pounds you did I didn't get promoted you did yeah, that's you that's not me. That's you

1209
01:01:20.28 --> 01:01:24.04
Yeah, man, and so it's cool that you got a little

1210
01:01:26.12 --> 01:01:31.32
Little little boost sure from the podcast maybe you saw something a little bit differently that's awesome

1211
01:01:31.64 --> 01:01:35.000
But you know you out there in the field you're the one that's making it happen

1212
01:01:35.56 --> 01:01:39.32
We're sitting back here maybe we're right a little cover fire little cover moved on

1213
01:01:40.04 --> 01:01:44.84
But the the thing that's cool about that to is it's

1214
01:01:44.84 --> 01:01:50.92
It proves what we talk about on here all the time which is the human will is so strong

1215
01:01:51.64 --> 01:01:56.36
But people sometimes people go through their life. They didn't know that they had it and so they just got to get recognized

1216
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That hey you've got this strong will that you can

1217
01:02:02.44 --> 01:02:07.64
You can you can use I was I was I was listening to an interview with Jack Black of

1218
01:02:07.64 --> 01:02:14.44
Tenacious D and he was talking about when he first discovered that he had a good singing voice

1219
01:02:15.24 --> 01:02:20.92
And he was in high school and he tried out for some school play and then he was supposed to sing this part and he hit that

1220
01:02:20.92 --> 01:02:26.28
You know and we need he said to himself like wow you know I've got this thing

1221
01:02:27.32 --> 01:02:31.96
I got this Lamborghini I didn't know I had this I got this extra gear that I can kick into

1222
01:02:31.96 --> 01:02:35.32
That's exactly what he says by the way. He's just got this extra gear

1223
01:02:35.32 --> 01:02:41.40
If that's what I think people listen to podcasts they always and realize I got this extra gear

1224
01:02:41.40 --> 01:02:44.76
They got this thing that they didn't know they had because they never had a tested before

1225
01:02:45.08 --> 01:02:48.68
Never talked about it. No one ever showed it to him. They didn't recognize it for whatever reason and

1226
01:02:48.68 --> 01:02:53.08
All of a sudden they realized oh I got this human will that is stronger than my weakness

1227
01:02:53.40 --> 01:02:57.48
And I'm just gonna engage it watch this nail biting no more

1228
01:02:58.20 --> 01:03:00.20
Jelly donuts not happening

1229
01:03:00.84 --> 01:03:03.48
Getting out work to work not gonna happen

1230
01:03:03.48 --> 01:03:11.32
Yeah, and it's I think it's a product because I'm one of those people straight up where I was surprised how how little

1231
01:03:11.88 --> 01:03:17.48
Actual will it took to make these little changes, you know because and and it's good because it does like these books and stuff

1232
01:03:17.48 --> 01:03:22.60
It puts it into perspective where these guys are really exercising their will you know with these crazy things and

1233
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
All that is isn't is an illustration that's it that it didn't even take

1234
01:03:27.64 --> 01:03:33.000
Me hearing that to understand that oh it doesn't take much will to do a workout when I didn't feel like it

1235
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.60
It didn't it didn't it didn't take that for me to recognize it that's that's just an illustration

1236
01:03:36.92 --> 01:03:40.12
It took me actually doing it and be like that wasn't hard at all

1237
01:03:40.20 --> 01:03:45.32
It seems hard and here's another reason why people don't realize it I think I was one of those people who didn't

1238
01:03:45.64 --> 01:03:50.12
Because everywhere you look you're always seeing like the the the four

1239
01:03:50.68 --> 01:03:55.72
Helpful tips to stop biting your nails or they're four all these like external things

1240
01:03:56.12 --> 01:03:58.60
You know they go into it to go to a hip netist

1241
01:03:58.60 --> 01:04:00.68
You know go do something outside of yourself

1242
01:04:00.68 --> 01:04:07.16
But something put some nasty taste tasting nail polish on your fingers. Yeah, so it makes you not want to buy all the stuff where

1243
01:04:08.28 --> 01:04:12.28
Really all you have to do just how you always say all you have to do is do it you know

1244
01:04:12.28 --> 01:04:17.000
You don't you want to stop biting nails. Okay stop biting your nails and if you really look at it like that

1245
01:04:17.08 --> 01:04:22.76
Where like if you would have said to me. Oh you don't feel like working out go workout if I would've been okay

1246
01:04:22.76 --> 01:04:27.72
I don't feel like working out so so I'm gonna go workout and you just keep it that simple that's all you got to do

1247
01:04:27.72 --> 01:04:32.36
You're like whoa you're done with the work. I know it was easy. I'm gonna do that next time

1248
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:37.48
You're almost kind of look forward to doing it everyone's gonna want to go back you look forward to exercising

1249
01:04:37.48 --> 01:04:42.68
You will just like you get look forward to certain work out sometimes not always right sometimes

1250
01:04:42.68 --> 01:04:47.16
I'm like oh good. I got squats today and I don't want to do it but sometimes you're squats

1251
01:04:47.56 --> 01:04:50.04
Yeah, get something so you can get the same feel about about

1252
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.64
Mobilizing your will yeah, it's like that yeah exactly right that's exactly what it is

1253
01:04:55.64 --> 01:04:59.96
That's actually one of the reasons I was listening to you know Brady guys they have that the true

1254
01:04:59.96 --> 01:05:05.24
Project podcast I was just going with um with our bill our either our bill

1255
01:05:05.24 --> 01:05:10.36
I don't know how you say I just know I just know is your yeah, but I just know a bunch of

1256
01:05:10.36 --> 01:05:15.16
Twitter yeah, I never heard his name pronounced. So I don't know that bitch big you know I'm beast and

1257
01:05:15.80 --> 01:05:22.36
There was just so they were talking about you know what music you listen to and the in the you know when you work out and stuff to get nuts and

1258
01:05:22.36 --> 01:05:28.52
But I don't listen to any music and that's one of the reasons where oh, that's why I did it

1259
01:05:28.52 --> 01:05:33.96
I was like I'm always trying to distract myself from the pain you know and let me listen to this music

1260
01:05:33.96 --> 01:05:38.04
Get me fired up or to make me feel good kind of mentally and so I can get through the pain of you know

1261
01:05:38.04 --> 01:05:39.72
I don't know Matt cons or whatever

1262
01:05:39.72 --> 01:05:48.92
That's like listen to listen to no music but it turns out I like that better now because you just feel more in touch with like what you're doing

1263
01:05:48.92 --> 01:05:52.36
Um, but oh, here's that here's one so I'll do

1264
01:05:53.64 --> 01:05:59.32
What are they called they're kind of like front squats, but you hold the two kettle bells like this. Yeah, they're like I feel they're called but

1265
01:06:00.52 --> 01:06:05.40
So I'll do 25 reps of 25 so it's hard so when you get to about 12

1266
01:06:06.12 --> 01:06:11.16
You're like oh, you gotta you know you kind of start to hit a certain type of wall and then when you get up to like

1267
01:06:12.04 --> 01:06:16.84
16 18 you're like oh, you know, so what as a result of that

1268
01:06:16.84 --> 01:06:22.28
I would play little numbers games in my mind so I'd count backwards from six six five four you know

1269
01:06:22.28 --> 01:06:25.80
I mean so you just kind of like I'm approaching the end it'll be done soon kind of thing

1270
01:06:26.20 --> 01:06:29.48
But what let it start doing is like nope. I'm gonna count them

1271
01:06:29.72 --> 01:06:33.16
One two three four five and you'll end in the beginning

1272
01:06:33.16 --> 01:06:38.68
I started to feel like tang when I'm getting up to 12. I'm like oh my gosh the pain is coming and it comes and you're like dang

1273
01:06:39.24 --> 01:06:43.96
And then instead of playing more mental games like let's just count down from here because so the end is you know

1274
01:06:43.96 --> 01:06:50.60
Insight nope. I'm gonna count up now and when you count up the numbers going up give you this weird mental picture like the pain is coming more

1275
01:06:50.60 --> 01:06:55.96
No because you're you're deeper into this thing, you know and it's like this it's almost like mental abuse

1276
01:06:55.96 --> 01:06:57.96
You're doing this yourself

1277
01:06:57.96 --> 01:07:01.96
But after a while you can look forward to that you kind of look forward to those higher numbers

1278
01:07:01.96 --> 01:07:07.32
You know, it's like bringing it kind of thing and it gets you it essentially gets you even more fired up

1279
01:07:08.36 --> 01:07:11.16
Good, oh, I'm telling you embrace the pain

1280
01:07:11.16 --> 01:07:13.16
In

1281
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:15.16
Great

1282
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:21.64
Does the inability of the average person to defend themselves make them more susceptible to fear generally in life and

1283
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:25.80
Kenju Jitsu president Jitsu reduce societal fear

1284
01:07:26.76 --> 01:07:28.76
I think it's it's a pretty obvious answer

1285
01:07:29.32 --> 01:07:33.48
But yeah, I mean obviously if you can defend yourself

1286
01:07:33.88 --> 01:07:35.88
It's gonna give you more

1287
01:07:35.88 --> 01:07:37.88
confidence in

1288
01:07:37.88 --> 01:07:44.84
The world and if you don't know how to defend yourself you're gonna have more fear in the world that's just the way it is

1289
01:07:45.40 --> 01:07:47.40
And I know that

1290
01:07:47.80 --> 01:07:52.36
Jitsu definitely gave me a lot of confidence in the world because when you're looking at someone

1291
01:07:53.56 --> 01:07:56.76
You at least know you're not a pushover at a minimum

1292
01:07:57.24 --> 01:08:02.28
You know, I'm not gonna go out easily so yeah, I think if you don't know how to

1293
01:08:03.48 --> 01:08:05.72
Defend yourself at all. I think you're definitely gonna be

1294
01:08:05.72 --> 01:08:10.44
More susceptible to fear that's kind of common sense and

1295
01:08:11.40 --> 01:08:12.92
Also

1296
01:08:12.92 --> 01:08:14.92
the the thing with

1297
01:08:15.40 --> 01:08:18.20
Not knowing when you don't know about things you

1298
01:08:19.08 --> 01:08:21.40
You are more scared of them

1299
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:25.000
You've been in confrontations because you're on them on the jitsu mat your in confrontations all the time

1300
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.56
And if you do in a case and you know the occasion that you should put on boxing gloves and boxing even strike during

1301
01:08:29.56 --> 01:08:34.60
Jitsu you should do that stuff so you recognize what it's like to be in fight and then you have

1302
01:08:35.72 --> 01:08:38.44
You'll be less afraid of the unknown because it's known

1303
01:08:38.84 --> 01:08:43.72
We're always afraid of the unknown. Well now this is known now the other thing is the better you are with

1304
01:08:44.52 --> 01:08:47.48
Jitsu and better you are at fighting the less

1305
01:08:48.12 --> 01:08:51.24
Apped the less likely you are to have to use it because

1306
01:08:51.88 --> 01:08:57.08
Because people will know that by the way you're acting that you're probably not a person that should be messed with

1307
01:08:57.08 --> 01:08:59.08
And

1308
01:08:59.08 --> 01:09:04.04
The other thing is I think when people actually know how to fight

1309
01:09:05.88 --> 01:09:11.56
They put up less of a front about who they are about trying to act like a tough guy because hey, man

1310
01:09:11.56 --> 01:09:14.20
I'm feeling pretty good, you know I got no problem saying hi to you

1311
01:09:14.60 --> 01:09:17.56
I can I can say hi to you in the street like hey how's it going? No big deal

1312
01:09:17.56 --> 01:09:21.64
I'm not feeling like you're gonna take advantage of me now because I know how to fight

1313
01:09:21.64 --> 01:09:26.36
So I love you jitsu guys are super nice guys, you know because they're not trying to prove how tough they are

1314
01:09:26.36 --> 01:09:31.32
You actually know how tough they are. Yeah, so I think that's pretty obvious, you know

1315
01:09:31.80 --> 01:09:34.60
That's the the many benefits of

1316
01:09:35.16 --> 01:09:41.24
Jitsu from a personal level then for as far as societal fear. I would also say yes, it's it's helpful

1317
01:09:41.56 --> 01:09:44.04
Because if you can handle yourself on a personal level, right?

1318
01:09:44.92 --> 01:09:47.72
Then you can handle yourself in other

1319
01:09:47.96 --> 01:09:54.20
Dynamic situations and you're more aware of things and you are better at staying calm

1320
01:09:54.20 --> 01:09:58.84
Right, Jitsu teach you how to stay calm. Oh, yeah, you get in a bad situation if you panic

1321
01:09:58.84 --> 01:10:03.08
You're going down so and you get in put bad situations all the times you get used to it and you realize

1322
01:10:03.56 --> 01:10:08.28
That you need to detach and you need to get out of your head and camp panic and cake it claustrophobic

1323
01:10:08.28 --> 01:10:12.20
You used to get claustrophobic and you don't really get claustrophobic too much anymore. Oh, it's literally

1324
01:10:13.08 --> 01:10:17.96
Straight up and and also with Jiu Jitsu and

1325
01:10:17.96 --> 01:10:24.92
And you know next martial arts training boxing mojitai wrestling you overcome adversity

1326
01:10:25.56 --> 01:10:32.84
You know you overcome adversity you have to and so when you know how to overcome adversity on the

1327
01:10:32.84 --> 01:10:37.40
Matt or in the cage or in the ring that's gonna help you in real life overcome adversity

1328
01:10:38.04 --> 01:10:41.40
So I think that those are real simple reasons why

1329
01:10:41.40 --> 01:10:47.16
Jitsu is good if you didn't think I thought Jitsu is good. I do think it's good. I need it for good for everyone

1330
01:10:48.44 --> 01:10:50.44
Updating

1331
01:10:50.44 --> 01:10:53.000
In really there's a lot of martial arts you could put in there. I'm talking about Jitsu

1332
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.32
But it's the same with boxing it's the same with with

1333
01:10:55.96 --> 01:10:58.60
Mojitai it's the same with wrestling it's the same with judo

1334
01:10:58.60 --> 01:11:04.44
Sometimes I forget to mention judo. I shouldn't judo's also very effective martial art

1335
01:11:05.40 --> 01:11:09.48
So I think all those things are very helpful for personal overcome in personal fear and

1336
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:15.32
Giving people confidence and thereby overcoming societal fears as well. Yeah

1337
01:11:15.96 --> 01:11:20.84
This is kind of a sign up with with the Jiu Jitsu force. Let's say and this more applies to

1338
01:11:22.20 --> 01:11:23.56
This

1339
01:11:23.56 --> 01:11:30.52
Concept kind of has been coming up recently where you know your first day in Jiu Jitsu where you I think you and me and kind of

1340
01:11:32.92 --> 01:11:37.48
Our time where we started Jiu Jitsu we didn't look at it in terms of like playing art

1341
01:11:37.48 --> 01:11:44.36
I didn't you know you started Jiu Jitsu in 1992. Oh, I'm just saying from 92 all away too about I don't know

1342
01:11:45.64 --> 01:11:49.000
I don't know the date but I'm saying if you like old school jiu jitsu where

1343
01:11:49.80 --> 01:11:54.12
You's probably started Jiu Jitsu because of hoist Gracie if you're one of these people one of us

1344
01:11:54.44 --> 01:11:57.64
That's what I started Jiu to hoist Gracie when you have see one tooth, you know

1345
01:11:58.28 --> 01:12:01.96
Where we looked at Jiu Jitsu as okay if I get in a fight with someone

1346
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:03.96
I want to be up to win the fight even if he's bigger than me

1347
01:12:03.96 --> 01:12:09.24
It wasn't because oh I want to be the next world champion, you know concerned about how to effectively hold

1348
01:12:09.48 --> 01:12:14.92
You know the most points of my body points in this yeah, or when I pull guard like the coolest like flip move

1349
01:12:14.92 --> 01:12:20.12
I can do whatever and I'm not saying like that's what it is. I'm not saying that but there that is in the game now

1350
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:24.52
So sometimes a result of this sometimes you can go with no Jiu Jitsu experience

1351
01:12:24.52 --> 01:12:29.40
You don't know about twice Gracie necessarily you haven't you know that isn't what compelled you to learn Jiu Jitsu

1352
01:12:29.40 --> 01:12:33.80
You just hear great things like you know from taco or whoever and you're like hey I want to go

1353
01:12:34.92 --> 01:12:39.08
Learn Jiu Jitsu this is the best fighting thing according to jiu kama go see I'm gonna go see what up

1354
01:12:39.08 --> 01:12:46.92
And then they go in there and then let's say the first day they'll learn you know just an arm lock from the bottom or you know

1355
01:12:46.92 --> 01:12:51.96
Something that if you don't go in with the full context of what Jiu Jitsu is it won't

1356
01:12:52.44 --> 01:12:56.52
Translate you know you learn a movie and you'll be like wait how how am I gonna go in a fight now?

1357
01:12:56.52 --> 01:13:00.68
You know it's like cool that's a cool move. It's kind of like you know what guy hey let me show you when you're kid

1358
01:13:00.68 --> 01:13:05.000
Let me show you this finger lock. Yeah, you're like that's cool, but how you gonna get my finger

1359
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.24
Exactly, you know like all this day just doesn't apply to a fight so so just to answer you're right

1360
01:13:09.24 --> 01:13:11.24
I just did a little like tiny

1361
01:13:12.04 --> 01:13:18.68
Instructional thing for some people that hadn't trained before and it was to support a charity and so it's all good

1362
01:13:19.24 --> 01:13:24.20
But you know these people never done Jiu Jitsu before and I taught them you know the mountain escape

1363
01:13:24.20 --> 01:13:28.52
Right and and immediately you know one of the guys hey

1364
01:13:28.84 --> 01:13:33.48
You know what happens when they do this because he's doing this right here. Yeah, okay, so bring it back in everyone

1365
01:13:34.04 --> 01:13:37.32
And basically you know after this happened a couple times I said here's the deal

1366
01:13:37.32 --> 01:13:42.12
I'm teaching you a new language. Yeah, so far. I've taught you the word

1367
01:13:42.52 --> 01:13:46.20
The right man that's the only word. I've taught you the yeah

1368
01:13:46.20 --> 01:13:51.32
I haven't even taught you I because that would that would be a context of self-awareness

1369
01:13:51.32 --> 01:13:55.08
Which you don't have right you only know the that's it

1370
01:13:55.72 --> 01:13:59.56
That's it that's all you know and actually I shouldn't be you I should have said I just taught you the word

1371
01:14:00.68 --> 01:14:02.68
Purple yeah because

1372
01:14:02.68 --> 01:14:07.08
You can't the actually can apply to different things right this when you just learn one thing

1373
01:14:08.04 --> 01:14:13.56
It's it's not meaningless, but it's only it's almost but if you walk into a foreign country and the only word

1374
01:14:13.72 --> 01:14:15.72
You know how to say was

1375
01:14:16.20 --> 01:14:20.60
Purple and their language is not gonna get you very far at all right

1376
01:14:20.60 --> 01:14:26.20
It's not and that's the same thing so you're right in the context of like a singular move

1377
01:14:26.60 --> 01:14:29.32
Jitu is worthless right now

1378
01:14:29.48 --> 01:14:36.76
Back when I learned five moves and knew the rear naked joke the arm lock the camera and no one else knew anything

1379
01:14:38.20 --> 01:14:42.68
When you can say five different words in a world where no one can speak

1380
01:14:43.24 --> 01:14:48.60
You have power and that's the way it used to be now. It's not like that anymore everybody everybody watches you have see

1381
01:14:48.60 --> 01:14:53.40
Everybody watches you have see and so they everyone seen in arm lock before everyone seen a rear naked joke

1382
01:14:53.40 --> 01:14:57.64
They you can watch a rear naked joke and see that's a simple move you can see how you put that on somebody

1383
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:06.92
So yes you are correct, but if you got it you got to do more than just the context of like a singular move because that's gonna be very useful to you

1384
01:15:06.92 --> 01:15:08.28
Yeah, so when you

1385
01:15:08.28 --> 01:15:13.40
All right, remember watching you see and there was a guy who would commentate right kind of a dirty guy, but he

1386
01:15:13.40 --> 01:15:18.28
He kind of knew apparently he took Jitu so he would kind of call it even okay, so now hoist crazy

1387
01:15:18.28 --> 01:15:20.52
He wants to get on top right now stop his position

1388
01:15:21.08 --> 01:15:24.84
He can't get to take down so now he's pulling guard kind of thing and then or he'll be like okay

1389
01:15:24.84 --> 01:15:30.36
He's establishing position with a mount and he's gonna he's gonna punch him until he turns over and then he's gonna choke him

1390
01:15:30.36 --> 01:15:35.32
And he's calling it any does it right so I remember thinking okay that mount position very

1391
01:15:35.80 --> 01:15:39.56
It's very powerful or if he's on the bottom you want guard kind of thing

1392
01:15:39.56 --> 01:15:44.76
You can see you know cuz you kind of explain so when I first started Jitu like an actual class

1393
01:15:45.32 --> 01:15:50.92
I knew what guard was I knew what mount was I knew those positions in why they're important where you know

1394
01:15:50.92 --> 01:15:54.76
Like if you're if someone's mounted on you where a hoist crazy would always be mounted on the person

1395
01:15:54.76 --> 01:15:56.12
It's like it's really hard to get out

1396
01:15:56.12 --> 01:15:59.08
He's gonna struggle and and if you turn over your even worse

1397
01:15:59.72 --> 01:16:03.56
Situation, you know, so I kind of knew that so I knew the actual context and

1398
01:16:03.56 --> 01:16:11.000
A lot of people when they go and you just to just because they hear about how cool it is they don't have that that that foundation going in so I think man

1399
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I think that

1400
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.56
I don't know if they'd ask for it or what but I think when when when instructors when a new person a brand new person don't know

1401
01:16:19.56 --> 01:16:23.72
Zero days of Jitu if they teach that like this is the mount. This is why it's important

1402
01:16:23.72 --> 01:16:30.04
You know just like how you did at the master where you like you know, you know, I can you you can hit just like that and then that'll provide

1403
01:16:30.04 --> 01:16:35.56
Consident at the end how you taught a move you know submission or whatever then it's like okay in mount

1404
01:16:35.56 --> 01:16:41.24
This is one of the many things you can do and it's like oh and by the way when I say many I mean infinite. Yeah

1405
01:16:41.24 --> 01:16:49.64
Yes, yeah, so yeah, so yeah, I think that if you and I guess this goes out to like anyone who goes into their Jitu class and learned

1406
01:16:49.96 --> 01:16:56.12
Just happened to be on the day where you learn like some kind of arbitrary move given the fact that you don't know the foundation

1407
01:16:56.12 --> 01:17:01.72
It with the foundation any move is gonna make a lot more sense as long as you have that foundation

1408
01:17:01.72 --> 01:17:05.56
Important somehow important of guard the importance of you know all these other things

1409
01:17:06.28 --> 01:17:11.56
Of course we all want to learn the submission what cool submission? Who can I get this guy in who wants to fight me?

1410
01:17:11.56 --> 01:17:13.16
This guy yeah

1411
01:17:13.16 --> 01:17:14.84
Another thing in people houses, you know

1412
01:17:14.84 --> 01:17:20.92
Well, they're he keeps pulling my hand away. I go yeah, it's a fight you're fighting another person. It's not just who's not magic

1413
01:17:20.92 --> 01:17:24.12
I say you did some magic, but it's not magic. It's not magic

1414
01:17:24.12 --> 01:17:30.44
It's a fight the person's gonna resist you have to have moves. Yeah, I didn't it doesn't turn into magic until you have it all

1415
01:17:31.72 --> 01:17:36.68
Together yeah, then it turns into magic and then you bestow it upon someone who doesn't you know

1416
01:17:37.24 --> 01:17:43.08
It's like magic right man. He's the train this little guy George he's a purple belt no's white belt and

1417
01:17:44.84 --> 01:17:47.64
Man he's he's the one who taught me butterfly guard. He was small too and

1418
01:17:48.60 --> 01:17:53.96
He would you be flying me around doing butterfly guard sweeps and like straight arm locks and stuff like from the

1419
01:17:53.96 --> 01:17:58.44
Bottom yeah, like probably what is this guy doing magic yeah, and one time he's like someone at wow

1420
01:17:58.44 --> 01:18:02.20
We're you know how like when you're rolling you can kind of talk to people while you're rolling

1421
01:18:02.20 --> 01:18:07.000
You know especially if you're rolling with a guy who's advances well because you don't have to focus on what you're doing kind of thing

1422
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.92
So this was an introduction of that concept where I'm rolling with George he's carrying on a conversation with this guy

1423
01:18:12.92 --> 01:18:14.92
Not inappropriate like what did you do this?

1424
01:18:14.92 --> 01:18:19.64
We didn't it wasn't that it was someone was asking him like hey like how do you how did you do that kind of thing?

1425
01:18:19.64 --> 01:18:22.36
He's like well this is what he's doing and while we're rolling he's kind of

1426
01:18:22.36 --> 01:18:28.20
Commentating his rolling and he's like so and this sets up the sweep which I'm about to get him with and it yeah, and he gets me with this sweep

1427
01:18:28.20 --> 01:18:32.20
And that's the small that's why it is that's why it is kind of magic magic because

1428
01:18:32.84 --> 01:18:35.80
When if I could make

1429
01:18:36.04 --> 01:18:42.04
This coin disappear if I could actually do that that would be magic

1430
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.84
If I can take your arm against your will and straight it out and there's nothing you can do to stop it

1431
01:18:48.84 --> 01:18:51.80
Yeah, it's kind of magic still yeah in some way

1432
01:18:53.16 --> 01:18:58.28
I mean type that is what magic is though right when when you make it a pierce like illusion

1433
01:18:58.28 --> 01:19:01.08
Right where you a me go about talking about I'm talking about actual

1434
01:19:01.64 --> 01:19:06.60
Yeah, actual magic yeah, no such thing yeah, well, yeah, I know tough as jets here

1435
01:19:08.68 --> 01:19:12.36
What did you see that way when they they don't know when they don't know how you did that?

1436
01:19:12.36 --> 01:19:14.36
How did you get it?

1437
01:19:14.36 --> 01:19:20.68
You know me so it's similar to that making the coin disappear, but it really just went behind yeah, not go or whatever possible

1438
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.84
I'll wait you by two to go

1439
01:19:22.84 --> 01:19:28.20
Yeah, let me see how you did that. Yeah, watch this do it again. I don't got it do it do it do it get it

1440
01:19:30.20 --> 01:19:31.32
Good

1441
01:19:31.32 --> 01:19:32.52
Next question

1442
01:19:32.52 --> 01:19:38.44
Hi, Jockel. I've been listening to your to you ever since I first heard you with Tim Ferris I've been considering jiu jitsu

1443
01:19:38.44 --> 01:19:44.44
Man jiu jitsu. Same thing yeah ever since hearing you guys talk about it so passionately however

1444
01:19:44.44 --> 01:19:47.32
I've had a shoulders I've had sold shoulder surgery

1445
01:19:47.80 --> 01:19:51.64
Liberal tear in the past and some issues with bicep tenonitis

1446
01:19:52.84 --> 01:19:57.96
And I'm worried that grappling sport that a grappling sport might make me prone to injury again

1447
01:19:57.96 --> 01:19:59.96
Would you recommend you jitsu for someone like me?

1448
01:20:00.92 --> 01:20:05.000
Thanks in advance for taking the time and providing your head life

1449
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.40
So there's another form of jiu jitsu actually and that I don't talk about very much

1450
01:20:09.40 --> 01:20:13.48
But it's definitely a feasible thing for such a waste like this. That's the learning jiu jitsu

1451
01:20:14.04 --> 01:20:17.000
Right learning jiu jitsu learning the moves

1452
01:20:17.80 --> 01:20:27.56
Drilling them gaining the understanding of how they all fit together and then only sparring in like a really controlled environment and and by that

1453
01:20:27.56 --> 01:20:28.60
I mean

1454
01:20:28.60 --> 01:20:33.48
Highly skilled instructor that isn't going to hurt you or let you get hurt doing something stupid

1455
01:20:33.48 --> 01:20:35.48
And

1456
01:20:35.48 --> 01:20:42.92
That will provide you with enough resistance so that you know moves are going to work but not taking it to fall on level 27

1457
01:20:43.80 --> 01:20:45.80
You know bloodbath battle and

1458
01:20:46.20 --> 01:20:55.24
Unfortunately this situation is kind of is very likely and I've seen this perform sure you have to where you get somebody that made that an injury or maybe they're

1459
01:20:55.80 --> 01:20:59.56
They're in some job where they can't get hurt, you know

1460
01:20:59.56 --> 01:21:04.04
All right and surgeon or an older person that doesn't want to get hurt

1461
01:21:04.04 --> 01:21:08.76
They're in the middle so I've seen this people do this before what they do is they basically take jiu jitsu

1462
01:21:08.76 --> 01:21:14.04
They take private jiu jitsu classes and they only roll with the instructor and they learn moves and they learn how to put together

1463
01:21:14.76 --> 01:21:16.76
That's

1464
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.72
That's one way to do it is you just find a good it now

1465
01:21:20.04 --> 01:21:24.60
You I've heard nightmare stories about this too where the jiu jitsu instructor feels the need to prove himself

1466
01:21:24.76 --> 01:21:27.000
Which is just pathetic. Yeah

1467
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.12
There's no way when you go in and you tell them instructor hey

1468
01:21:30.12 --> 01:21:34.04
I've got a bad shoulder. I've got a bad knee. I've got a bad neck. I've got a bad back

1469
01:21:34.04 --> 01:21:40.52
Whatever you tell them and you say look I just want to I just want to learn the techniques and and learn how to apply them in a very

1470
01:21:40.52 --> 01:21:42.76
Fundamental way. I'm not here to compete

1471
01:21:42.76 --> 01:21:45.64
I have no ego and I don't want to prove anything. I just want to be more knowledgeable

1472
01:21:46.20 --> 01:21:52.84
The jiu jitsu instructor should be more than happy to take you on board and and let this you know do this

1473
01:21:53.32 --> 01:21:55.32
you can also do it

1474
01:21:55.32 --> 01:21:58.76
If you I mean because it jiu jitsu private instruction is very expensive

1475
01:21:59.32 --> 01:22:03.24
You can also do it in a group setting but what you have to do

1476
01:22:04.60 --> 01:22:11.48
So you have to keep your ego completely in check unlike anything you've ever tried before because every idiot

1477
01:22:11.80 --> 01:22:15.80
And by every edit I mean every human being on earth all of them

1478
01:22:16.68 --> 01:22:18.68
You take that person

1479
01:22:18.68 --> 01:22:22.44
If I take a person that weighs 145 pounds

1480
01:22:22.44 --> 01:22:28.60
Who's never trained any jiu jitsu or wrestling before and I say okay

1481
01:22:28.92 --> 01:22:34.28
You know you want me to teach you jitsu here. I'm gonna put this arm lock on you and I take their arm

1482
01:22:35.24 --> 01:22:40.04
And I say okay, so this is what it feels like when you get arm locked their instinct is well you how are you getting it my arm there?

1483
01:22:40.04 --> 01:22:42.76
You won't be able to do that. They're gonna fight it. They're gonna fight it

1484
01:22:43.56 --> 01:22:48.44
Always gonna fight it so everyone's ego gets involved so you have to

1485
01:22:48.44 --> 01:22:53.40
Just completely put your ego in check because you think oh I'm gonna roll with this guy over you

1486
01:22:53.40 --> 01:22:56.92
But I'm gonna think a little bit stronger than I'm gonna go and you just get hurt that's how you get hurt

1487
01:22:56.92 --> 01:22:59.08
Yeah, especially if you have pre-existing injuries

1488
01:22:59.40 --> 01:23:04.04
So you have to do that you have to find the right training partners that are completely mellow and have nothing to prove

1489
01:23:04.04 --> 01:23:06.68
And are very relaxed and and experience in jiu jitsu

1490
01:23:06.68 --> 01:23:12.52
So if they do catch something that's gonna be a little bit awkward. They say oh yeah, man. Let's let you go no big deal no big deal at all

1491
01:23:12.52 --> 01:23:20.12
And and and and you do that and then you slowly very slowly escalate over time once you know and understand

1492
01:23:20.12 --> 01:23:22.12
Jiu jitsu you start to go a little bit harder

1493
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.60
Still keeping your ego in check and all that now if you do that

1494
01:23:27.88 --> 01:23:34.36
You should be able to get into jiu jitsu over them out of doctor. I don't know the condition of your laboral tear so I

1495
01:23:35.08 --> 01:23:39.24
I don't have the authority or the or the

1496
01:23:39.24 --> 01:23:41.24
What the proper

1497
01:23:43.32 --> 01:23:46.36
credentials to to give you the go ahead

1498
01:23:46.92 --> 01:23:53.32
But if you do what I just said there's you should be okay now the problem is that's hard to do what I just said

1499
01:23:53.32 --> 01:23:59.16
It's hard for everybody because everybody's competitive and jiu jitsu is a very competitive thing and when I say competitive

1500
01:23:59.16 --> 01:24:02.04
It's mentally competitive just makes you think I want to

1501
01:24:02.04 --> 01:24:08.68
I had these guys in the other day these guys are you know senior executives learning jiu jitsu for the first time didn't know anything

1502
01:24:09.56 --> 01:24:14.68
And I taught them you know how I taught them the oomph in the elbowscape to escape them out

1503
01:24:15.16 --> 01:24:19.08
I I told them to go through them like just to practice the move on each other

1504
01:24:19.48 --> 01:24:23.56
They do they do six minutes of it. They come back and back in the middle. They're sweating

1505
01:24:24.44 --> 01:24:28.44
Some of the pairs are sweating because they were having a level seven battle

1506
01:24:28.44 --> 01:24:31.96
Yeah, and those and these were again

1507
01:24:33.08 --> 01:24:35.72
45 50 55 year old

1508
01:24:36.60 --> 01:24:38.60
Executive type people but

1509
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:41.32
You try to move and they want to fight. Yeah

1510
01:24:42.44 --> 01:24:47.48
So that's what you got to be careful of and you know you don't want to get you know

1511
01:24:47.48 --> 01:24:51.80
You don't want to worship injuries. You don't want to do other you want to have other sports impacted

1512
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:53.16
You know you might enjoy

1513
01:24:53.64 --> 01:24:55.64
surfing or whatever playing

1514
01:24:55.64 --> 01:25:01.48
Another sport basketball and you ruin it and now you can't play because you did jiu jitsu

1515
01:25:01.48 --> 01:25:05.16
I don't want that to happen to you but you can do jiu jitsu in a controlled way

1516
01:25:06.04 --> 01:25:11.000
That you shouldn't need to get hurt, but you need to keep your damn ego in check

1517
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.40
Yeah, and I think that that seems obvious. I think but

1518
01:25:18.44 --> 01:25:22.84
Apparently is not as obvious like you know how you have you know laboral to our special if you had surgery

1519
01:25:22.84 --> 01:25:28.60
I've had yeah if you had surgery and by September nice these are all things that like if you do a

1520
01:25:29.48 --> 01:25:33.000
Yeah, okay, you got to do a separate program, but you do rehab

1521
01:25:33.48 --> 01:25:35.000
Like you'll improve that

1522
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.48
Where and that's really the main thing with these injuries

1523
01:25:37.48 --> 01:25:41.40
You know how people will they have back or they have shoulder stuff that they get surgery they get it fixed

1524
01:25:41.80 --> 01:25:45.16
And then but it's still you know what you're just gonna have that for the rest of your life kind of thing

1525
01:25:45.24 --> 01:25:48.20
But if you focus on rehab like it's a straight-up workout

1526
01:25:48.20 --> 01:25:56.36
Where I mean don't push it because that's not what rehab is you really have to rehab it but you I tell you you focus on that like it's an actual program like a workout program

1527
01:25:56.36 --> 01:25:57.56
Take it seriously

1528
01:25:57.56 --> 01:26:01.88
But you can a lot of times you can get rid of these things fully especially like

1529
01:26:02.52 --> 01:26:07.48
10 to 90s by September. I like I had surgery on my vice up straight up torn off the bone surgery

1530
01:26:07.48 --> 01:26:10.36
So of course, I'm gonna be prone to 10 to 90s, but you just

1531
01:26:10.36 --> 01:26:14.76
Man you gotta treat it like it's like that's another thing of your body that you gotta develop, you know

1532
01:26:14.76 --> 01:26:16.76
Got to focus on 10 to 90s, you know

1533
01:26:16.76 --> 01:26:23.32
So I man I would recommend that big time where and you'll be more compelled to do it when you find a hot fungie

1534
01:26:23.32 --> 01:26:29.16
You do it and you're like shoot I could be like getting after it rolling way better if my shoulder like just felt better and

1535
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:34.52
Man you go do some extra stuff like all these little rotator movements for your shoulder because I

1536
01:26:34.52 --> 01:26:39.24
Shoulder to massage like during the demonstration you know, sorry, it's not sometimes

1537
01:26:39.72 --> 01:26:43.72
During the demonstration pulls my shoulder out which was kind of hurt from like the day before from

1538
01:26:43.72 --> 01:26:47.88
Remember Ryan Gillespie oh yeah, yeah, so he hurt my shoulder then

1539
01:26:47.88 --> 01:26:51.16
Sardge hurt it the next day anyway, it sells jacked couldn't do any pressing whatever

1540
01:26:51.72 --> 01:26:58.12
Do those little bent like use those rubber band things and I would use the cables at the gym at 25 fitness and men

1541
01:26:58.84 --> 01:27:04.76
It but brings it back and 10 to 90s same thing you can get therapy and stuff like that do that man and

1542
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.92
It'll help it so if you didn't do any kind of rehab and then you just jump into due to it's like yeah, you're gonna be way more

1543
01:27:10.92 --> 01:27:12.92
Yeah, and you know like the

1544
01:27:12.92 --> 01:27:14.92
The

1545
01:27:14.92 --> 01:27:24.12
Disclaimer here is like it's jujitsu. It's a contact sport and you're gonna get twisted up and if you're scared of getting twisted up and you are a

1546
01:27:25.24 --> 01:27:28.60
You know concert pianist yeah, or your surgeon

1547
01:27:29.64 --> 01:27:35.64
You need to accept the fact that this is the this is a full contact sport and you can definitely get hurt

1548
01:27:35.88 --> 01:27:39.80
You know, and we have we have we have an actual surgeon. You know

1549
01:27:39.80 --> 01:27:43.80
We got a several doctors, but we have an actual hand surgeon and

1550
01:27:45.08 --> 01:27:50.92
You know Dr. Luke trains ghee no ghee does it all full speed and full all the time black belt by the way

1551
01:27:50.92 --> 01:27:53.72
Yeah black belt by the way MMA fighter too, but

1552
01:27:54.36 --> 01:27:59.72
But yeah, he knows the risks he's cautious. He tapes his finger. You know he just take the precautions

1553
01:27:59.72 --> 01:28:04.12
Yeah, you take the precautions and then you accept that there is a level of risk

1554
01:28:04.12 --> 01:28:12.60
You know, I train for 20 whatever five years and I hurt my finger, you know like whatever a couple weeks ago

1555
01:28:12.60 --> 01:28:16.20
Dang and and I just hurt another finger. You know these things happen

1556
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:18.92
So what are you gonna do?

1557
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:21.88
You're gonna not train that's up that's that's

1558
01:28:22.28 --> 01:28:23.08
Impossible

1559
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:28.68
Kind of an option I guess. Yeah, it's kind of an option, but you can train in a method that you are a

1560
01:28:28.68 --> 01:28:36.28
Oh less likely to get hurt and you can go so far in the spectrum of not getting hurt that you that you could

1561
01:28:36.68 --> 01:28:37.96
Really get that

1562
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:42.84
Possibly getting hurt to an absolute minimum. Yeah, you know, and that's what I said if you're training with a black belt and

1563
01:28:42.84 --> 01:28:47.64
Structure and you're just doing privates and you guys have a really good understanding your chance of getting hurt a pretty small

1564
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Yeah, yeah

1565
01:28:51.72 --> 01:28:53.72
But yeah, if you did

1566
01:28:53.88 --> 01:28:58.20
If you let that keep you from doing it, I think you're doing yourself more harm than good

1567
01:28:58.20 --> 01:29:02.28
And that goes for anything that's really true is like dang if you have to go to the post office

1568
01:29:02.28 --> 01:29:07.32
But you're scared of the statistics of car crashes and you can so what you do not go to the post office

1569
01:29:07.32 --> 01:29:10.36
But you got to mail that thing, you know, yeah, you got to get it done

1570
01:29:11.48 --> 01:29:16.68
True, David next question. You got to mail that thing. I go whatever you know whatever the case maybe

1571
01:29:18.12 --> 01:29:23.64
When you're stepping into a leadership role and you have someone on your staff who's not a team player

1572
01:29:23.64 --> 01:29:28.04
Create clicks goes over me and straight to my bosses

1573
01:29:28.92 --> 01:29:30.60
When there's a problem and

1574
01:29:30.84 --> 01:29:37.72
Whenever whenever whenever has concerns voices them among teammates and not directly to me. How do I continue in my role?

1575
01:29:38.76 --> 01:29:41.80
How do I set assess myself and how do I tackle this problem?

1576
01:29:42.36 --> 01:29:44.76
Biggest thing we got to do is build in relationship with that person

1577
01:29:44.76 --> 01:29:48.68
You know you got to get that person's head you got to find out what's going on you got to find out

1578
01:29:49.08 --> 01:29:51.48
You got to you got to you got to talk to him. You got to build that relationship

1579
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:53.72
You're going to talk to him about why they're going over your head

1580
01:29:54.68 --> 01:29:58.20
Then you know what when they say well I'm going over your head because this happens you go

1581
01:29:58.20 --> 01:30:03.88
Oh, I didn't know that you know I'm going to get that fix and you build up a little trust and then they say some other problem

1582
01:30:03.88 --> 01:30:07.48
You get that one fixed and then you say hey man

1583
01:30:07.88 --> 01:30:13.40
You know, it's you know, it's kind of hurts the team is when you're telling the team things that are negative

1584
01:30:14.44 --> 01:30:17.72
And if we could work together to you know

1585
01:30:17.72 --> 01:30:22.28
You tell me what's going on that's negative and then we solve the problem. We're going to do better as a team

1586
01:30:22.28 --> 01:30:27.16
And that's that's my goal just do better as a team and I see that you're a leader

1587
01:30:27.56 --> 01:30:32.76
Because people listen to you and when you start saying negative things they start thinking negatively because you just

1588
01:30:32.76 --> 01:30:38.20
Influential person and and and the influence you have over people is something that is going to be

1589
01:30:38.52 --> 01:30:40.52
Can be very beneficial to what we're doing

1590
01:30:41.40 --> 01:30:45.56
If you want it to be I want you to want it to be but you know

1591
01:30:45.56 --> 01:30:48.52
I'm not you you have that I don't so

1592
01:30:49.48 --> 01:30:55.72
Let's work if you could help me move this in a positive direction so our team can be more successful

1593
01:30:56.84 --> 01:31:01.24
That's the kind of thing I would do here and and the other thing is you know

1594
01:31:02.20 --> 01:31:06.36
Ask them straight up. Hey, what am I doing wrong is leader? What can I do better?

1595
01:31:07.16 --> 01:31:08.92
Where can I become

1596
01:31:08.92 --> 01:31:12.60
Where can I make more things happen so that way and what you're doing is you're letting down your guard

1597
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:18.52
You're letting them give the opportunity to hopefully be honest with you about what you're doing wrong and then you can give them

1598
01:31:19.40 --> 01:31:23.24
You know you can correct those measures now there is a possibility this person is jerk

1599
01:31:24.04 --> 01:31:27.40
And when you say what am I doing wrong? We go back and say hey this guy's even notice doing

1600
01:31:27.88 --> 01:31:36.36
He's so that's why you need to take it slowly and fuel the situation out and and make an assessment of how they're going to react to these things and

1601
01:31:36.44 --> 01:31:38.20
Build a little bit of

1602
01:31:38.20 --> 01:31:43.24
Little bit of leadership capital with that person before you go and say what am I screwing up because then it's a girl dude

1603
01:31:43.24 --> 01:31:46.44
Jocquad doesn't even know what he's doing. He's asking me what he should be doing

1604
01:31:47.32 --> 01:31:51.56
So don't if the person's a jerk you have to watch out for that so that's where we're gonna build a relationship first

1605
01:31:54.28 --> 01:31:56.28
It's like building a relationship

1606
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Seems like a very

1607
01:31:59.24 --> 01:32:03.24
Common theme for stretching solution. It is very much so

1608
01:32:03.24 --> 01:32:09.88
You know you take the extreme example of I'm a hostage taker and you're my hostage

1609
01:32:10.92 --> 01:32:15.16
And I'm threatening to kill you. What are you supposed to do build a relationship with me?

1610
01:32:15.40 --> 01:32:19.88
You want to get me to see you as a human. That's what we're talking about the same thing. That's an extreme example

1611
01:32:20.52 --> 01:32:25.24
But this is the same thing going on here. It's a really done by the way. I heard this story was on the news

1612
01:32:25.24 --> 01:32:30.28
I forget how old the girl was who's a kid though a girl a kid and she all she did was

1613
01:32:30.28 --> 01:32:33.72
Blab to this guy who kiddoctor and he wound up letting her go

1614
01:32:34.28 --> 01:32:40.44
Because she she built their relationship with this team member that's creating clicks and doing all this negative stuff

1615
01:32:40.44 --> 01:32:44.12
It's because he doesn't know you and he's he's just going. I don't know you know

1616
01:32:44.12 --> 01:32:47.08
Jocquad is a mystery to me. He doesn't hang out. I don't know

1617
01:32:47.64 --> 01:32:52.92
He's bad. He's just V there's a separation. Yeah, so I'm gonna close that separation. I'm gonna

1618
01:32:52.92 --> 01:32:57.64
Blab to him. I'm gonna build a relationship and we're gonna let that little kid go

1619
01:32:57.64 --> 01:32:59.64
Yeah

1620
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:06.28
I remember working in the nightclub where you know you have different bosses different managers. They work different shifts or whatever so

1621
01:33:07.16 --> 01:33:09.16
one guy

1622
01:33:09.16 --> 01:33:11.48
This game is Matt Gilmore tall tall guy

1623
01:33:12.20 --> 01:33:16.92
I love that guy. He was real. I don't know for whatever he's actually I could I could just relate to him

1624
01:33:16.92 --> 01:33:21.96
You know he was just real nice and I don't know the way he talked was kind of not funny like a comedian

1625
01:33:21.96 --> 01:33:25.08
But just kind of you know some people when they talk it's just kind of entertaining

1626
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:29.24
You know every time everyone's in all though you certain words that's just kind of unique to them

1627
01:33:29.24 --> 01:33:35.64
It's like I like that anyway really liked him and so I was hoping and he would usually work on Friday Saturdays right

1628
01:33:35.64 --> 01:33:39.56
He was kind of high up and then there was other guy

1629
01:33:39.96 --> 01:33:44.44
I'm not gonna say his name nonetheless is this other guy and this guy he was like the full on kind where

1630
01:33:45.24 --> 01:33:51.40
He had this air about him where he I'm the manager of this club kind of thing and on off time

1631
01:33:51.40 --> 01:33:55.72
To feed me had like a party or something that we're cruising or whatever and he talked about

1632
01:33:56.52 --> 01:34:01.56
Yeah, you know I'm in the office doing these sexual things with this person and just you know real

1633
01:34:01.88 --> 01:34:05.80
Real douchey for lack of a bit of a real douchey kind of guy and one time he was

1634
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.76
There was this rule long time ago. There's this rule you can't go upstairs

1635
01:34:11.16 --> 01:34:15.32
There was like three levels in this club so you can't go upstairs like this high-end kind of lounge

1636
01:34:15.32 --> 01:34:17.32
You can't you wear jeans upstairs

1637
01:34:17.32 --> 01:34:22.12
You're just there's a dress guy had been to that one yeah, now you would not be welcome for

1638
01:34:22.12 --> 01:34:25.72
Flops and shorts or no you won't even get in the front of apparently

1639
01:34:26.52 --> 01:34:31.64
So one day on my off night I had jeans on I went upstairs real quick just to talk to one of my friends

1640
01:34:31.88 --> 01:34:36.84
Cake nuts and cuz he was up there and so I was talking to him and this guy this manager the one I didn't like

1641
01:34:37.24 --> 01:34:42.60
He was up there and he'd be like he was like hey the rules apply to everyone you know go downstairs

1642
01:34:42.60 --> 01:34:48.36
So I'm like oh you know, I'm just I will I'm just gonna talk to him. He's like the rules apply to everyone go downstairs

1643
01:34:48.36 --> 01:34:52.04
Like not be nice about it off so I'm like all right, whatever. That's just an example one experience

1644
01:34:52.60 --> 01:34:58.36
The next week he comes in on his night off jeans

1645
01:34:59.88 --> 01:35:05.08
Upstairs or whatever and as a joke not being a dick as a joke. I was like hey you've jeans on I was working

1646
01:35:05.08 --> 01:35:11.32
And he's like he goes he's oh yeah, well my title has a bit more letters than yours does

1647
01:35:13.08 --> 01:35:20.76
Yeah, so he said to me so you know I'm not sure where we're going with this. No that I was gonna say that's an example of him not building

1648
01:35:20.76 --> 01:35:22.76
Relationship with me

1649
01:35:23.56 --> 01:35:25.56
He certainly did not

1650
01:35:25.56 --> 01:35:29.40
Matt Gilmore wouldn't have said that he would have to either not he would either

1651
01:35:29.88 --> 01:35:34.04
Compromised with me the first night or he wouldn't he would have laughed at my joke and be like

1652
01:35:34.04 --> 01:35:37.80
Ha, good point whatever or both he probably would have done both

1653
01:35:40.44 --> 01:35:42.04
Still friends with Matt Gilmore by the way

1654
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.24
Okay next question in light of recent events what is the best course of action when confronted by an obvious

1655
01:35:50.12 --> 01:35:59.56
Abuse of authority resulting in personal injury due to an innocent person to an innocent person that that occurs in one's presence

1656
01:35:59.56 --> 01:36:07.48
At what point is it acceptable to physically engage with the saline even though the saline has some kind of authority

1657
01:36:08.04 --> 01:36:10.52
Sorry, that's two questions wait what what's the

1658
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:14.12
recent event is the

1659
01:36:15.32 --> 01:36:20.64
Person on the airplane getting dragged off and injured because the over

1660
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:24.04
United all that yeah, yeah overbooked flight

1661
01:36:24.04 --> 01:36:31.24
Yeah, so any you know obviously I guess you could put more recent events is you know if you if you could have a

1662
01:36:32.20 --> 01:36:36.44
Police officer right that's doing something you could have a bouncer

1663
01:36:36.76 --> 01:36:42.76
You know, I'm sure you have plenty of stories about your night club days besides just wearing jeans in the wrong area

1664
01:36:42.76 --> 01:36:44.76
I don't know is a big violation

1665
01:36:45.32 --> 01:36:46.52
But

1666
01:36:46.52 --> 01:36:51.80
So so here's what here's what here's my answer that's what do you do and when one of those things happened first of all

1667
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:54.76
The people that are in the situation are wrapped up in the situation

1668
01:36:55.08 --> 01:37:00.92
They're they're emotionally mentally wrapped up in the situation the situation is escalated they're caught in a storm

1669
01:37:00.92 --> 01:37:02.92
Mm-hmm and

1670
01:37:02.92 --> 01:37:07.88
You're not in the storm you're outside the storm. So what do most people do when they see that storm going on? What do most people do tell me

1671
01:37:09.80 --> 01:37:15.40
Panic no they pull out their iPhones and they start recording the situation that's what they do

1672
01:37:15.80 --> 01:37:19.80
That's what everyone does hey. Oh, there's a fight going on world star. Let's review

1673
01:37:19.80 --> 01:37:22.56
You know what I'm saying I'm impressed that you know about world

1674
01:37:22.56 --> 01:37:25.56
Yeah, we'll have a lot of good fights on there. I have to watch so

1675
01:37:27.32 --> 01:37:32.24
Yeah, well because you learned from you see we wake people up you see some human nature in in videos

1676
01:37:32.24 --> 01:37:36.76
So that's what people do so what you actually want to do instead of pulling out your video

1677
01:37:36.76 --> 01:37:40.28
It is you want to try and get them out of that moment emotionally

1678
01:37:40.28 --> 01:37:44.28
You want to talk to them like a normal person engage with them, you know

1679
01:37:44.68 --> 01:37:46.68
Hey hey sir

1680
01:37:46.68 --> 01:37:52.36
You need to calm down that's just a police officer. He doesn't mean any harm. Hey, you know officer

1681
01:37:52.92 --> 01:37:57.88
That that guy's not a threat to you right now. You know just take a step back it looks like he's trying to relax

1682
01:37:57.88 --> 01:38:02.88
You know you want to talk them disengage them get their heads out of those bad scenarios

1683
01:38:02.88 --> 01:38:05.88
Yeah, and you know being a calm voice

1684
01:38:06.40 --> 01:38:08.92
Say something like I said say something. Hey officer

1685
01:38:08.92 --> 01:38:11.24
There's a lot of people that are videoing this right now

1686
01:38:11.24 --> 01:38:16.64
You know just a lot of people saw what happened. So let's it's it's you don't have to do anything

1687
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:20.12
else you can let's let's get this person under control

1688
01:38:20.12 --> 01:38:24.80
I can give you a hand whatever you know you just want to you and and of course

1689
01:38:24.80 --> 01:38:29.16
What is there initial reaction? It'll be back at you but just back away or you know shut up

1690
01:38:29.16 --> 01:38:34.32
You're you know you don't know and and so you need it absorb that right say hey look

1691
01:38:34.32 --> 01:38:38.44
I'm not I'm not giving you any threats at all. I'm just here to help out

1692
01:38:38.44 --> 01:38:40.84
I don't want to see any trouble. Don't want you to get in trouble

1693
01:38:40.84 --> 01:38:48.60
You just want to talk to people and get them to get them out of that emotional storm that they're in both sides

1694
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.88
Both sides because it's a really nasty situation

1695
01:38:52.08 --> 01:38:57.16
You know when you don't listen to me when I start to hurt you when I grab your your wrist

1696
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:01.88
Let's say like one of those like police pain compliance type moves

1697
01:39:01.88 --> 01:39:05.84
I grab your wrist and I start to twist it you as a human being

1698
01:39:07.28 --> 01:39:09.28
The natural instinct

1699
01:39:09.28 --> 01:39:13.96
Some people might have the instinct to comply but a lot of people have the instinct if you grab me and start hurting me

1700
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:17.62
I'm gonna pull away. Yes, okay your resisting now you're resisting to what I need you

1701
01:39:17.62 --> 01:39:21.36
I need to go harder. Well the harder I go the more you resist and you see where this is going

1702
01:39:21.72 --> 01:39:28.52
Next thing you know I'm beating you in the head because I don't know how to use a choke-old unfortunately because in some areas

1703
01:39:29.04 --> 01:39:31.04
choke-old or illegal

1704
01:39:31.20 --> 01:39:34.20
So again as the outsider

1705
01:39:34.20 --> 01:39:43.90
You want to pull them out of that you want to talk to them you want to get them to see that outside of the emotional storm that they're in both sides

1706
01:39:44.44 --> 01:39:46.44
Both sides are an emotional storm

1707
01:39:48.36 --> 01:39:55.04
Physical intervention, you know now we're talking like this is a serious step you start stepping into these scenarios

1708
01:39:55.68 --> 01:40:02.24
You don't you know you want to be very very careful about stepping into these one of these situations and

1709
01:40:02.24 --> 01:40:06.80
And even that physical escalation should be or physical

1710
01:40:07.44 --> 01:40:11.36
Intervention should be just with a subtle purpose of deescalating, right?

1711
01:40:11.44 --> 01:40:17.36
You're not walking over and you know grabbing a guy. No, hey, you know, it's like a hand on the shoulder. Hey, sir

1712
01:40:17.92 --> 01:40:20.08
a officer hey, you know

1713
01:40:20.08 --> 01:40:23.84
Tsa agent or whoever you are hey, let's just calm down

1714
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:29.92
Let you want me to give you a hand getting this person under control. You know you you don't want to get these people to wear now

1715
01:40:29.92 --> 01:40:33.04
You become because as soon as you do that you just end the storm

1716
01:40:33.44 --> 01:40:37.92
You you part of the storm now. Yeah, even though you're trying not to be you're you're you're

1717
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:39.60
You're entering the storm

1718
01:40:39.60 --> 01:40:43.92
So you got to be very very cautious about what you're doing there and

1719
01:40:44.64 --> 01:40:49.76
You know at what would I do in a situation where I saw someone getting you know

1720
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:51.44
Be to death

1721
01:40:51.44 --> 01:40:58.40
You know, I'm gonna do what I just said you know now might I go a little bit further because I have a lot of experience and maybe I can handle situation and deescalated physically

1722
01:40:58.40 --> 01:41:05.76
Yeah, and you know you see this sometimes where something will be escalating in an innocent civilians will come and help

1723
01:41:06.16 --> 01:41:15.12
Unoffair secure a person so those there's ways to do it. Yeah, you just got to be very very cautious when you do those when you do that because

1724
01:41:15.68 --> 01:41:19.52
The the other piece of this is and again you see this on on YouTube

1725
01:41:20.64 --> 01:41:27.68
You don't know what happened to get to this point. You don't know who that person is who the perpetrator is right the perpetrator might look totally innocent

1726
01:41:27.68 --> 01:41:30.88
But you don't know any background so when you start stepping in there

1727
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:35.68
You might be stepping in there to defend a person that just shot a person or a person that just you know

1728
01:41:35.68 --> 01:41:41.12
Got caught doing something or a person that really did resist the cops hard and do do some damage

1729
01:41:41.12 --> 01:41:47.84
So I don't I don't know and I'm generally gonna side with with a police officer, right?

1730
01:41:47.84 --> 01:41:52.08
I mean the police officer. I'm I'm respecting that they that they're doing the right thing

1731
01:41:52.08 --> 01:41:57.12
Yeah, and sort of step in there and start making something happen is and is not gonna generally work out in a good way

1732
01:41:57.76 --> 01:42:01.68
Maybe you can help them get the perpetrator under control

1733
01:42:02.64 --> 01:42:10.96
But yeah, to to make the assumption that because a cop is escalated to a point of violence that the cop is an outer control crazy cop

1734
01:42:11.52 --> 01:42:13.52
It's but not an accurate assumption

1735
01:42:13.52 --> 01:42:15.52
Yeah, most likely

1736
01:42:15.52 --> 01:42:21.84
That's the wrong assumption. Yeah, you know cops are not walking around waiting to to to beat the crap

1737
01:42:21.84 --> 01:42:25.76
Out of people that's not what they're doing. They don't want to do that when it happens it's

1738
01:42:26.40 --> 01:42:31.20
Something something has generally led up to when we see it in a case that isn't like that

1739
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:34.40
That's why we see it because it's now news it's now news

1740
01:42:35.68 --> 01:42:38.40
So be very very careful about that again

1741
01:42:39.44 --> 01:42:43.20
You know most of the time you know just trying to escalate it verbally

1742
01:42:43.20 --> 01:42:47.52
Ask if they need any assistance ask if you can call 911 form and get more assistance for them

1743
01:42:47.52 --> 01:42:51.28
Ask if they need any help talk to that you know do that take that approach

1744
01:42:51.28 --> 01:42:53.28
If you have to physically intervene

1745
01:42:53.84 --> 01:42:55.84
Especially if you have some experience

1746
01:42:55.84 --> 01:42:59.92
You know let them know what you're doing. Do you need any help? Do you need any assistance to that type of thing?

1747
01:42:59.92 --> 01:43:05.28
And I'm sure we'll get some feedback from from some cops on this one and it'll be good. Yeah

1748
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:08.24
Yeah, I feel like when I was back to the

1749
01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:11.28
Balancer situation when guys would you know

1750
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.08
Fight would break up so in a club on a fight break breaks out is more chaotic than you know in the street when you see two guys fighting

1751
01:43:18.08 --> 01:43:25.04
So it's a little bit more dangerous when you jump into the fight to try to break it up because if you just jump in and

1752
01:43:25.28 --> 01:43:29.36
Grab the guy the guy doesn't know if you're trying to break up the fight or if you're a guy

1753
01:43:29.36 --> 01:43:32.96
You're just another attacker. Yeah, exactly right. So he's gonna start swinging or whatever

1754
01:43:33.52 --> 01:43:38.32
And that's not to mention any of that guys friends who sees you do that in the dark

1755
01:43:38.40 --> 01:43:41.28
You know all this you know the dark club lights whatever so

1756
01:43:41.60 --> 01:43:45.92
He might hate you whatever and then you know bottles can be it can be dangerous

1757
01:43:45.92 --> 01:43:48.80
So if you jump in there

1758
01:43:49.44 --> 01:43:53.68
With before you even touch the person you you're already saying

1759
01:43:54.48 --> 01:43:59.76
Break what I would always say is either break it up or or calm down like calm down guys break it up

1760
01:43:59.76 --> 01:44:04.08
Before you even touch them and they hear that so when they feel you they don't feel a punch

1761
01:44:04.08 --> 01:44:07.60
Got it. It's like calm down calm down and they feel you kind of it's more of a light

1762
01:44:08.32 --> 01:44:12.64
Given a compared to the guy who he's fighting with it's not a punch. It's not a wrestling move

1763
01:44:12.64 --> 01:44:18.56
It's nothing like that's like you're breaking it up and you just gave me a good reminder to if you're on the outside and you see something like this

1764
01:44:18.56 --> 01:44:22.96
Going on like if you're on that plane you see this this this passenger getting roughed up

1765
01:44:23.28 --> 01:44:29.04
You know hey hey passenger just calm down do what they're telling you to do just do what they're just

1766
01:44:29.04 --> 01:44:35.44
Complied with what they're doing to do you know just relax let them cuff you just relax you know you can take it you know

1767
01:44:36.56 --> 01:44:41.20
Definitely heard cops say this actually I heard the guy that was on Sam Harris's podcast

1768
01:44:41.20 --> 01:44:44.88
Like if you want to got an issue with what a cops doing to you bring it to the court

1769
01:44:44.88 --> 01:44:48.72
Let your lawyers handle it don't handle it right there because you're gonna lose

1770
01:44:49.04 --> 01:44:51.12
You're gonna lose that situation you're gonna end apart

1771
01:44:51.12 --> 01:44:53.12
You're gonna end up injured. It's gonna be a bad-sort scenario

1772
01:44:53.44 --> 01:44:58.64
So the same thing tell the tell you know if you see someone getting getting roughed up then hey

1773
01:44:59.36 --> 01:45:03.36
Hey man we're all watching just comply just do what they're telling you to do and

1774
01:45:03.60 --> 01:45:08.68
Take it up to with a lawyer later just trying to get that person to calm down because yeah that's you know

1775
01:45:09.20 --> 01:45:10.80
chances are

1776
01:45:10.80 --> 01:45:14.32
You know the police officer he's arrested thousands of people

1777
01:45:14.32 --> 01:45:18.000
Put his hands on thousands of people that person that's getting roughed up

1778
01:45:19.12 --> 01:45:21.76
They haven't they've not been arrested you know

1779
01:45:21.76 --> 01:45:25.76
I can guarantee you that united passenger probably never been arrested in his life

1780
01:45:26.08 --> 01:45:30.40
So here he is and like I said you start to pull me I'm gonna resist

1781
01:45:30.40 --> 01:45:34.80
I don't people don't pull me no pull me but now we've got an incident going on

1782
01:45:35.04 --> 01:45:40.000
So instead if someone say hey listen just listen to what they're telling you you need to just calm down

1783
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.64
You don't want this to get any worse that type of thing yeah talk to people and get them to detach a little bit

1784
01:45:44.64 --> 01:45:50.000
Yeah, and obviously the united situation isn't is this linear situation works like hey

1785
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.96
That's the passenger's fault he should have just went with him kind of thing

1786
01:45:52.96 --> 01:45:58.16
You know I mean this all this yeah, I honestly all I know about I don't know anything about it other than

1787
01:45:58.88 --> 01:46:02.88
I saw the guy getting dragged out of the plane that's what that's the only part of us all guy getting dragged out of the plane

1788
01:46:02.88 --> 01:46:07.84
And I saw the good Gracie yeah the Gracie breakdown about how to defend yourself when that's his equation

1789
01:46:07.84 --> 01:46:09.84
Yeah, and he was

1790
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.36
He was

1791
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:16.60
It's just a long story. He was there was that does apply you know if you're getting

1792
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:23.28
Arrested or or taking off the plane or whatever and you choose to fight for your rights right then and there

1793
01:46:23.28 --> 01:46:29.32
Amen, that's a battle that you're gonna you gotta do that you know and there's consequences to that when you mean you gotta do that

1794
01:46:29.44 --> 01:46:33.46
It's like you ever heard the expression if you want to be a gangster you gotta do gangster stuff

1795
01:46:33.46 --> 01:46:38.42
Okay, it's actually gangster shit, but but but you're not you're not advising I'm

1796
01:46:38.42 --> 01:46:42.98
Sayin if you want that beef then you're gonna get that okay that's yeah, so

1797
01:46:43.94 --> 01:46:48.34
So yeah do it but like I said especially with like the tops if they're arresting you and you're like hey

1798
01:46:48.34 --> 01:46:51.22
You violated my rights, so I'm gonna fight you right now for my right

1799
01:46:51.38 --> 01:46:54.42
Yeah, if you want that beef, okay, but

1800
01:46:54.82 --> 01:47:01.54
It's you're gonna be more you're gonna be safer first off and more effective if you fight for your rights administratively later

1801
01:47:01.54 --> 01:47:03.54
You know and

1802
01:47:03.54 --> 01:47:05.54
So nonetheless

1803
01:47:06.18 --> 01:47:08.18
Kind of on attention there, but the

1804
01:47:08.90 --> 01:47:17.62
Oh the cop when you're helping the cops or whatever it's the same way as if you're a balancer you kind of identify yourself kind of thing just like how you're saying and

1805
01:47:19.46 --> 01:47:23.38
It is easy I think to and they call it availability bias, right?

1806
01:47:23.38 --> 01:47:30.46
It's easy to be like all these cops are beating this guy up and I see this on YouTube all the time where the cops just beat up these guys

1807
01:47:30.46 --> 01:47:36.34
You know, so these are bad cops or whatever, but it's like anything where when you say

1808
01:47:36.34 --> 01:47:39.02
It made the news because it's this bad cops

1809
01:47:39.02 --> 01:47:44.98
It's in your mind you know all the good cops and the legit arrest all that they're not on YouTube millions

1810
01:47:44.98 --> 01:47:47.62
They're not on YouTube. Yeah, exactly and even if they were

1811
01:47:48.50 --> 01:47:52.46
That doesn't stick in your mind. That's like if you business is usually like

1812
01:47:52.46 --> 01:47:57.66
Here's what I'm citing video of a police officer doing this job. Yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, I want some watch that

1813
01:47:57.66 --> 01:48:01.42
They want to see somebody screwing up and they forget about it. It's totally not in their mind

1814
01:48:01.42 --> 01:48:06.30
So yeah anything you know being screwed up or anything that just has this emotional impact on their mind

1815
01:48:06.30 --> 01:48:12.94
They're gonna think it's like way more common than it really is so I think it's important to kind of keep that in mind always

1816
01:48:12.94 --> 01:48:14.94
You know absolutely

1817
01:48:16.70 --> 01:48:18.70
Next question

1818
01:48:18.70 --> 01:48:26.58
If you have a subordinate that has an improved after talks and instruction, but can't but you can't fire them because of the union

1819
01:48:26.58 --> 01:48:28.58
What do you do?

1820
01:48:29.94 --> 01:48:34.34
I'm gonna find something that they're good at and I'm gonna get them to focus on that and

1821
01:48:35.54 --> 01:48:38.46
I'm gonna you know as a leader that's what you're trying to do as a leader

1822
01:48:39.06 --> 01:48:44.34
You got to make your team members if you got team members that you that you can't get rid of for whatever reason and

1823
01:48:44.58 --> 01:48:48.94
They're not quite doing what they should be doing or they're not up to speed what can they do?

1824
01:48:48.94 --> 01:48:52.18
What can they offer to the team when I find out what you can offer the team?

1825
01:48:52.18 --> 01:48:54.18
I'm gonna have you focus on that so it is

1826
01:48:54.18 --> 01:48:59.54
Hmm if that causes some kind of disruption because you know echo can only move

1827
01:48:59.94 --> 01:49:03.46
10 bricks a day and everyone else is moving 200 and

1828
01:49:03.78 --> 01:49:07.34
So now everyone's all mad because echo is not working and not carrying his load

1829
01:49:07.62 --> 01:49:13.38
Well, I'm gonna you know, well, no one I'm gonna look for a job for him where he's no one sees him care not carrying bricks

1830
01:49:13.38 --> 01:49:17.30
Right? Hey, instead of doing that you're gonna organize the bricks over here. You're gonna count

1831
01:49:17.30 --> 01:49:20.66
You're gonna count bricks because you're weak. Yeah, so you're gonna be the brick counter

1832
01:49:20.66 --> 01:49:25.54
So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna change it up and find out what they can do that's what that's what you have to do as a leader and by the way

1833
01:49:25.54 --> 01:49:27.06
I'm not gonna give up on them

1834
01:49:27.06 --> 01:49:29.22
I might not I might not invest a ton of time

1835
01:49:29.22 --> 01:49:33.50
But I'm gonna keep saying hey, you know if you want to move from counting bricks to moving bricks is which got to do

1836
01:49:33.50 --> 01:49:37.50
Here's what you got to do you got to keep working you got to keep getting stronger to work on your deadlift

1837
01:49:38.02 --> 01:49:40.78
Work you know get a little bit stronger so you can carry more bricks

1838
01:49:40.82 --> 01:49:46.78
So it's you know and that happens it doesn't just happen because of unions it happens for all different kind of you

1839
01:49:46.78 --> 01:49:53.26
Happens the military you can't you know you get a guy that he's in a situation where yep

1840
01:49:53.26 --> 01:49:57.90
He's not gonna get we're not gonna let him go. Yeah, you know we've got to keep X amount of people in

1841
01:49:57.90 --> 01:50:02.46
Country okay, so this guy's one of the people in country. We were not allowed to get them. Okay cool

1842
01:50:03.26 --> 01:50:08.42
Well, what can he do? Maybe he can count bricks. You know I haven't count be the best brick counter. We got

1843
01:50:11.30 --> 01:50:15.78
You might have to do a little isolation to you know, I mean you might have to isolate him a little bit

1844
01:50:15.78 --> 01:50:20.96
Again, because you don't want people thinking oh echoes over there, you know in the air condition

1845
01:50:20.96 --> 01:50:26.38
And he doesn't do doing carrying his load and so that can cause problems yeah and chocolate is just letting it happen

1846
01:50:26.38 --> 01:50:30.78
It happens. It happens you know, so you might have you got to figure this out

1847
01:50:30.78 --> 01:50:33.42
How do you isolate them a little bit? How you make sure that they're working?

1848
01:50:33.42 --> 01:50:36.74
You know, maybe you can only count bricks, but whatever you work in more hours, you know

1849
01:50:36.74 --> 01:50:41.82
We're doing some other thing to make up for your slack in the brick carrying category. Yeah

1850
01:50:41.82 --> 01:50:44.82
Interesting

1851
01:50:44.82 --> 01:50:54.22
Bottom line as a leader when you get somebody that doesn't quite do what they need to do and you can't get rid of them

1852
01:50:54.78 --> 01:51:00.78
Find out what they can do and take advantage of it using to the best of their ability for supporting the team

1853
01:51:01.50 --> 01:51:04.76
Yeah, it kind of seems like I mean given what you said that I mean

1854
01:51:05.30 --> 01:51:07.80
This might dumb it down too much, but it's

1855
01:51:07.80 --> 01:51:11.80
A situation where you are making the best of it right exactly and

1856
01:51:12.88 --> 01:51:19.80
What I found in life when you make the best of something you don't get plagued with all because it let's say the two scenarios

1857
01:51:19.80 --> 01:51:24.08
One you're making the best of it to you're not so when you're not it's gonna be burning

1858
01:51:24.48 --> 01:51:29.44
Burning you every day. It goes only moving 10 brick. That's gonna bother me every day. Doesn't have to by the way

1859
01:51:29.44 --> 01:51:34.000
You're still gonna move this amount of bricks. We're gonna get the same amount of work done 10 bricks

1860
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.000
100 bricks 200 bricks whatever, but meanwhile you're getting tortured all day because you that the fact that that was not moving as many bricks are

1861
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.62
Isn't there condition from whatever that's bothering me every single day

1862
01:51:43.82 --> 01:51:49.14
But if you understand that we're making the best of this situation that's not gonna bother you know we're making the best of it

1863
01:51:49.70 --> 01:51:51.70
It's the best situation very true

1864
01:51:53.24 --> 01:51:56.64
Better attitude, you know make the best of the stitch

1865
01:51:57.68 --> 01:51:59.68
Next question

1866
01:51:59.68 --> 01:52:03.40
ego is the enemy. Can you take that too far?

1867
01:52:04.28 --> 01:52:07.72
I can joke about myself all day and be okay

1868
01:52:08.08 --> 01:52:11.88
But also I don't want coworkers not to take me seriously

1869
01:52:12.80 --> 01:52:18.58
So that's actually kind of two questions. It's talking about ego and then talking about joking around right?

1870
01:52:18.58 --> 01:52:22.88
Those are two different things a little bit like self-deprecating. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and so

1871
01:52:23.52 --> 01:52:25.04
can you

1872
01:52:25.04 --> 01:52:27.04
Can you be too humble and

1873
01:52:27.04 --> 01:52:31.60
Put your ego in so much check that it hurts you. Yes, actually you can't you know

1874
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:33.84
Hey echo how's it going? I'm in charge

1875
01:52:33.84 --> 01:52:38.12
I'm really horrible at this. I just don't know what I'm doing right? That's not good

1876
01:52:38.12 --> 01:52:41.12
You know it's like I said to the Marine Lieutenant right?

1877
01:52:41.12 --> 01:52:45.12
Am I telling them to go into check in and say hey guys?

1878
01:52:45.12 --> 01:52:50.40
I you know, I just don't I just got here just got out of the basic school. I don't know anything really

1879
01:52:51.04 --> 01:52:53.76
Do you want to fall that guy? No, that's what I'm talking about

1880
01:52:53.76 --> 01:52:59.36
So so can you be overly humble? Yes, I like I said it's okay to admit that you don't know everything

1881
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:01.36
But that doesn't mean don't be well prepared

1882
01:53:01.84 --> 01:53:05.60
That doesn't mean don't be confident that you can figure things out

1883
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:10.48
That doesn't mean you can't ask good questions right? It doesn't mean that you don't report in

1884
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:13.28
without knowing

1885
01:53:13.28 --> 01:53:17.68
The no-manclature and the fundamentals right that's gonna you know

1886
01:53:17.68 --> 01:53:22.48
I ain't chocolate just checked in but he knows what our mission's been he knows what our mission statement is

1887
01:53:22.48 --> 01:53:28.56
He knows how our basic process is he already looked at all that he knows everyone's name. Yeah. I'm prepared

1888
01:53:29.20 --> 01:53:30.96
I'm prepared

1889
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:36.000
So that's what you want to be that's not saying I have no idea what I'm doing right now

1890
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I just got here no

1891
01:53:38.24 --> 01:53:43.000
No, that's not what we're talking about so don't be overly humble

1892
01:53:43.72 --> 01:53:45.72
most people

1893
01:53:45.72 --> 01:53:50.56
The reason I talk about the other one of be humble all the time is because most people tend towards

1894
01:53:50.56 --> 01:53:57.92
Letting the video be inflated. That's what most people tend towards so I tend to talk more about hey keep your ego in check when you were

1895
01:53:58.24 --> 01:54:02.32
Checking because most people are so scared of looking bad. They say well, I know how to do this

1896
01:54:03.04 --> 01:54:07.52
Never seen it before I know how to do that never seen it before you're gonna look stupid. Hey guys

1897
01:54:08.48 --> 01:54:11.92
Hey, I've been putting charge in this I know you guys been doing it for a while

1898
01:54:12.16 --> 01:54:17.12
Looking forward to learning from you and how you execute it and and driving forward and keeping kicking ass in this mission

1899
01:54:17.12 --> 01:54:24.08
Does anyone get mad at that no it that's a lot different than hey guys. I have no idea what's happening

1900
01:54:24.72 --> 01:54:27.52
That's too much. Yeah, so don't go there

1901
01:54:28.80 --> 01:54:35.76
Be humble but not not passive put your ego in check, but don't turn into a baby word of the day

1902
01:54:38.40 --> 01:54:44.16
The second part of this is question about joking around too much and that's you know that's different from too much ego and

1903
01:54:44.16 --> 01:54:50.88
Absolutely you can joke around too much now of course and we've talked about this a good team

1904
01:54:52.24 --> 01:54:56.72
And a good leader they're having fun they're having fun with everything that you're doing and I always had fun

1905
01:54:57.20 --> 01:55:00.88
I was at fun. I still have fun all the time. I'm having fun

1906
01:55:02.40 --> 01:55:04.56
But if all you do is joke around all the time

1907
01:55:04.56 --> 01:55:10.40
Then when it comes time for the jokes to be over people won't take you seriously so that will be problematic you know I had a rule

1908
01:55:10.40 --> 01:55:17.84
That was no joking on the radios right so if you were on a radio you weren't allowed to take me jokes

1909
01:55:17.84 --> 01:55:22.64
No joking on the radio and what's cool about the cuz you know and tasking a bruiser when I was a

1910
01:55:22.64 --> 01:55:26.40
Patoon commander when I was a system to come in her we had fun all the time

1911
01:55:26.40 --> 01:55:30.80
We laughed we joked we had a blast with everything we did no joking on the radio

1912
01:55:31.36 --> 01:55:36.48
You see what I'm saying that was a law no joking on the radio and what was good about it

1913
01:55:36.48 --> 01:55:43.04
Was as I think back to that what that translated to was we're not joking around in the field and

1914
01:55:43.44 --> 01:55:48.48
That expanded like when we're briefing we're not joking around it was a very clear distinction

1915
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:53.04
Of course did people have we did things happen out in the fields and I was like oh my god

1916
01:55:53.04 --> 01:56:00.72
This is hilarious of course that happened but the general 99% of the time 95% of the time was hey

1917
01:56:00.72 --> 01:56:04.08
We're in the field we're working we are serious. That's the priority

1918
01:56:04.08 --> 01:56:10.40
Hmm, did we have fun in the field? Yes did I laugh in the field? Yes, but the priority and this norm was

1919
01:56:11.28 --> 01:56:14.96
We are going we are serious and we are that's the priority so

1920
01:56:16.24 --> 01:56:18.24
Don't joke so much that you

1921
01:56:20.72 --> 01:56:26.80
Don't get taken seriously one time I was with a senior ranking officer a flag officer meeting an officer with stars

1922
01:56:28.40 --> 01:56:33.36
And we went to go brief I wasn't attached this unit, but they went to go brief this unit

1923
01:56:33.36 --> 01:56:40.08
Or we went to go receive a brief from a unit and in the brief in a PowerPoint slide

1924
01:56:40.56 --> 01:56:47.44
These guys hadn't put a slide in that was an inappropriate slide and it was a crude joke

1925
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.88
And it was really funny. I thought it was really funny, you know

1926
01:56:50.88 --> 01:56:54.88
I was like oh that's pretty funny that these guys did that you guys saw the slide they had it up there

1927
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:59.76
And it was completely inappropriate and and and vulgar, right? That's what it was

1928
01:56:59.76 --> 01:57:07.04
They didn't know this general at all and he was a very straight-laced guy and didn't

1929
01:57:07.44 --> 01:57:15.04
Appreciate that kind of humor and they they had like the welcome side the next slide that came up was this inappropriate vulgar slide

1930
01:57:15.28 --> 01:57:22.16
What was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was it was inappropriate

1931
01:57:22.56 --> 01:57:24.56
I'll leave it at that and

1932
01:57:25.84 --> 01:57:28.32
And you know it was like there was a chuckle in the room

1933
01:57:28.32 --> 01:57:32.72
And at the same time there was nothing but silence in the room

1934
01:57:32.96 --> 01:57:40.16
And you could feel the discomfort and and since I like I said I thought it was funny and I knew it wasn't gonna go over well as

1935
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:41.68
As soon as I saw this oh

1936
01:57:41.68 --> 01:57:46.40
That's is not good and the reason I'm telling this big long story is because I have another rule

1937
01:57:47.28 --> 01:57:51.60
Don't put jokes into your slides in PowerPoint

1938
01:57:52.08 --> 01:57:56.64
No jokes because you can you can articulate the joke because you can feel the room out

1939
01:57:56.64 --> 01:58:03.52
You can see what's going on you can get it get a taste you can get a feel for them if you if you walk in if they would have

1940
01:58:03.76 --> 01:58:09.60
Had a chance if I could have said freeze the first slides up you even you've met the general here for for five minutes

1941
01:58:09.76 --> 01:58:11.20
Do you want to remove that slide?

1942
01:58:11.20 --> 01:58:15.60
They'd be like oh absolutely let's get it out of that because they could see that he was a serious guy and not you know

1943
01:58:15.60 --> 01:58:20.88
One to be that that wants to be seen that kind of thing it didn't take it wasn't hard it was you pretty easy book to read

1944
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.76
But you don't have that opportunity there was no hold on we're gonna delete this slide

1945
01:58:25.76 --> 01:58:27.76
No there it was boom

1946
01:58:28.72 --> 01:58:34.000
Welcome it was though it was after the slide of you know this is where we are it was the welcome slide

1947
01:58:34.56 --> 01:58:36.56
And I said oh

1948
01:58:36.40 --> 01:58:45.84
So no joking on the radio no joking on your slides keep your slides clean and and the the risk benefit you tell a good joke

1949
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:53.04
Hey, that's great you get you know two credits right if your joke is bad and considered inappropriate

1950
01:58:53.04 --> 01:58:59.52
It's negative 39 so it's not worth it. Yeah, it's not worth it. Yeah, and again. I'm all about you know

1951
01:58:59.52 --> 01:59:03.28
You you want to have fun when you're briefing you want people to be entertained and have fun

1952
01:59:03.44 --> 01:59:09.04
But you don't want to have inappropriate stuff. No. Yeah, so that's that for both these

1953
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.16
For both these things am I joking too much or I'm maybe in two series and my you know is my ego too big or am I being too humble

1954
01:59:16.16 --> 01:59:23.12
You it's a balance it's a dichotomy leadership and you got to find the right spot in the middle and you got to check yourself and you got to

1955
01:59:23.60 --> 01:59:28.16
You know if your team is joking when they shouldn't be joking guess what you're leading them the wrong direction

1956
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:33.20
If your team is somber and doesn't have any spirit

1957
01:59:33.44 --> 01:59:37.52
You're not having good enough time so you got to find the balance there same thing with ego, you know

1958
01:59:37.52 --> 01:59:41.60
or people talking with you and communicating with you and being open with you

1959
01:59:41.60 --> 01:59:46.88
And telling you when they disagree with things or is no one talking to you because if that's the case

1960
01:59:46.88 --> 01:59:49.20
Your ego is so big that they don't want to talk you

1961
01:59:49.92 --> 01:59:53.60
So find the dichotomy leadership find the balance between those two

1962
01:59:54.64 --> 02:00:00.000
That's a good one if they're if they're not talking to you. Yeah, because you know how it at work

1963
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:06.48
You're talking with your friends, you know, and then somebody comes that person comes to it

1964
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:12.08
You're like oh, you know for whatever reason you're not necessarily talking about them or nothing but they come in

1965
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:17.04
You got to stop your conversation, you know, yeah, that's like a little indicator, you know

1966
02:00:17.04 --> 02:00:23.04
If you roll up to see people across the room talking and you're like hey that looks like a cool conversation or whatever

1967
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:28.48
Or I'm gonna go say hi to pop whatever and you go and they stop talking and they stop like laughing

1968
02:00:28.48 --> 02:00:30.96
They just stop talking and they give you like small talk or whatever

1969
02:00:31.36 --> 02:00:36.32
That's that's an indicator. Yeah, yeah, it's an indicator or a tribute actually either one of those two

1970
02:00:36.32 --> 02:00:40.000
If people are having a good time and you walk into they stop laughing oh, so he said okay

1971
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:45.52
And if you walk in and they're having a conversation and they don't they just you know don't want to talk to you

1972
02:00:45.68 --> 02:00:49.68
You're they're probably they probably they probably don't like your big ego that's slapping them in the face

1973
02:00:50.48 --> 02:00:52.48
Put your ego and check

1974
02:00:54.48 --> 02:00:56.48
We got time for one more

1975
02:00:56.48 --> 02:01:08.64
One more juggle do you ever get worn down by everything you're trying to do and the things going wrong and things not working and having to work so hard only to come up short

1976
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
What do you do then

1977
02:01:13.52 --> 02:01:15.52
Of course

1978
02:01:15.84 --> 02:01:17.84
Me of course of course

1979
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:20.16
I get worn down

1980
02:01:20.16 --> 02:01:27.84
Of course I get frustrated with stuff of course things don't always go my way and of course

1981
02:01:29.36 --> 02:01:31.76
I come up short sometimes

1982
02:01:33.76 --> 02:01:35.76
Of course

1983
02:01:37.12 --> 02:01:40.16
But what do I do when those things happen?

1984
02:01:45.44 --> 02:01:47.44
I keep going

1985
02:01:47.44 --> 02:01:49.44
It's

1986
02:01:50.56 --> 02:01:59.68
It's really that simple. I put one foot in front of the other. I move forward another inch another centimeter

1987
02:02:02.56 --> 02:02:04.000
I

1988
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:12.40
Right one more sentence. I I am place one more brick on the wall like gut through one more workout

1989
02:02:12.40 --> 02:02:14.40
I

1990
02:02:14.40 --> 02:02:16.80
Step out onto the mat one more time

1991
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:22.24
Because

1992
02:02:22.88 --> 02:02:24.88
Because worn down

1993
02:02:26.80 --> 02:02:28.80
Isn't beaten

1994
02:02:30.56 --> 02:02:33.44
And frustration is not going to kill me

1995
02:02:36.32 --> 02:02:37.36
And

1996
02:02:37.36 --> 02:02:39.36
The things that don't go my way

1997
02:02:39.36 --> 02:02:43.76
They they just turn into targets that I'm going to attack harder

1998
02:02:46.96 --> 02:02:50.80
And when I do come up short

1999
02:02:53.76 --> 02:03:00.16
Okay, because I just learned one more thing that's gonna get me over the top

2000
02:03:04.16 --> 02:03:06.16
So

2001
02:03:06.16 --> 02:03:12.40
At those moments at those low points those times when it seems

2002
02:03:14.40 --> 02:03:16.40
That defeat

2003
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:23.20
Is starting to get the upper hand you don't need some grand plan

2004
02:03:24.48 --> 02:03:31.44
And you don't need a pep talk and you don't need a miracle

2005
02:03:31.44 --> 02:03:33.44
You

2006
02:03:35.68 --> 02:03:37.68
Just need

2007
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:39.68
to keep going

2008
02:03:43.36 --> 02:03:50.48
Keep going just keep going and don't stop regardless of what you are hit with

2009
02:03:54.32 --> 02:03:58.000
Because if you don't stop yourself

2010
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
The

2011
02:04:01.20 --> 02:04:06.24
Nothing else can and nothing else will

2012
02:04:11.12 --> 02:04:15.12
And I think that's all I've got for tonight

2013
02:04:16.64 --> 02:04:18.16
So

2014
02:04:18.16 --> 02:04:19.44
Echo

2015
02:04:19.44 --> 02:04:22.80
One of you go ahead and talk about how we can

2016
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:31.92
Support this podcast if we want to if we want to and support yourself if we want to which we do by the way

2017
02:04:32.16 --> 02:04:34.96
So talk about on it on it supplements

2018
02:04:36.72 --> 02:04:44.000
Physical and mental by the way, so I think you know I don't know if we failed to mention this or we just been mentioning it a little bit less

2019
02:04:44.96 --> 02:04:46.32
Which is

2020
02:04:46.32 --> 02:04:47.84
Alpha brain

2021
02:04:47.84 --> 02:04:53.36
We haven't talked about I feel like we haven't talked about Alpha brain that much recently been taking it by the way

2022
02:04:54.16 --> 02:04:56.16
But not talking about it

2023
02:04:56.16 --> 02:05:00.64
This is good, okay, so it's a new to they call it new tropic or new tropic something

2024
02:05:00.64 --> 02:05:03.84
True picks. I'm like that helps your brain nutrients to your brain boom directly

2025
02:05:04.56 --> 02:05:06.56
So two forms

2026
02:05:06.56 --> 02:05:10.72
The instant it's like powder. You mix it up with your gatorid. Yeah, whatever

2027
02:05:11.36 --> 02:05:13.36
No, you don't need to mix with gatorid

2028
02:05:13.36 --> 02:05:17.68
It doesn't you you can mix it on its own right there's two flavors

2029
02:05:18.56 --> 02:05:23.28
But yeah, there's peach and then there's natural spice and

2030
02:05:24.40 --> 02:05:26.40
The two flavors

2031
02:05:26.64 --> 02:05:29.04
Taste exactly like what they sound what they're named

2032
02:05:29.52 --> 02:05:32.96
Not peach tastes like peach yeah and natural spice

2033
02:05:33.28 --> 02:05:37.04
All natural spice kick too, but it's also it's got a little peach, but it's got a little natural spice right

2034
02:05:37.60 --> 02:05:38.80
Was

2035
02:05:38.80 --> 02:05:41.12
I didn't know those two flavors. Yeah, I have both

2036
02:05:41.12 --> 02:05:45.20
That's what what is this one this one is all this one is natural spice that's natural spice yeah

2037
02:05:45.20 --> 02:05:50.16
They get boom, but they have they they they taste sweet right so

2038
02:05:51.12 --> 02:05:55.36
You don't need to mix it with gatorid and you shouldn't be having gatorid anyways because it's just a bunch of sugar

2039
02:05:55.76 --> 02:05:58.56
Right in water even at a punch, but we'll say some

2040
02:05:59.76 --> 02:06:03.28
So me electrolytes in nonetheless mix it with whatever you want man

2041
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:08.64
Or just pour it into your mouth. It's powder. That's the thing compared to the capsules. Yep

2042
02:06:08.64 --> 02:06:13.20
Whatever you like you know the powder one is called the instant so it goes to your brain quick quicker

2043
02:06:13.60 --> 02:06:15.60
That's just an assumption

2044
02:06:15.76 --> 02:06:23.12
Nonetheless here. This is what it does which is cool. So you know how like you know you're talking to somebody and you blank out on something like somebody's name

2045
02:06:23.28 --> 02:06:25.28
No, but

2046
02:06:25.28 --> 02:06:27.28
Yeah, yeah

2047
02:06:27.28 --> 02:06:31.04
You gave me a word yeah, I don't think that's how come before wait oh before we were

2048
02:06:31.04 --> 02:06:33.52
We were recording live

2049
02:06:33.52 --> 02:06:39.12
I didn't yes acquaintance. I didn't have enough alpha brain. No, that was before we were recording anything

2050
02:06:39.36 --> 02:06:44.56
No, all right well there it is either way. That's what it does you need more alpha brain now. No, I think you do

2051
02:06:44.56 --> 02:06:49.92
I think I'm right because I took two of these and I think that that I'm correct nonetheless doesn't even matter

2052
02:06:50.40 --> 02:06:56.64
Because what it does is it makes you do that like way like actually you don't even do it and I don't I mean

2053
02:06:56.64 --> 02:07:01.92
Maybe that's a deficient something about some kind of deficiency when that happens you know when they call brain fart

2054
02:07:01.92 --> 02:07:04.80
I'm in a brain fart you know you don't get brains of constant

2055
02:07:04.80 --> 02:07:10.48
It's like gas-ex for your brain essentially you know how like gas-ex you know what that does right

2056
02:07:11.04 --> 02:07:16.48
So you don't you don't do that you don't have to think of words anymore. They just calm boom for real

2057
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:23.84
Now I don't want I kind of don't want to bring this up but I will anyways because I don't want to give people bias

2058
02:07:24.08 --> 02:07:26.48
What I don't you can tell me what cognitive bias says

2059
02:07:26.48 --> 02:07:33.20
But if you heard people like your brother Jade who says when he takes alpha brain his dreams get all crazy

2060
02:07:34.48 --> 02:07:40.64
So that's another thing that I and I've I've seen I've talked to other people that that get more vivid dreams

2061
02:07:40.96 --> 02:07:45.52
Right with the alpha brain. Yeah, so that's another thing just to be aware of yeah

2062
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.16
Now just I want I don't want to what kind of cognitive bias is that that's not a club of availability bias because I

2063
02:07:52.16 --> 02:07:58.24
Said it now you're waiting for it and so now you have a vivid dream you think it's the alpha brain. That's all right, right? That's like that's a placebo effect

2064
02:07:59.12 --> 02:08:04.08
Yeah, I guess but you're attributing it to something you're tripping it down for brain. Oh, yeah

2065
02:08:05.52 --> 02:08:09.20
So anyway that is a bias you may notice that

2066
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.16
Your dreams become more vivid. I don't notice it

2067
02:08:14.16 --> 02:08:17.44
But I've heard some people say I heard Joe Rogan talking about yeah

2068
02:08:17.44 --> 02:08:23.84
I heard a bunch and Jade is one of those Jay that's she said it before I even heard anything well say he's like all that's like a good thing

2069
02:08:23.84 --> 02:08:27.44
He did it wasn't a complaint do that's the thing lucid dream

2070
02:08:28.88 --> 02:08:33.04
But yeah, I like I don't have lucid dreams. I have savage nightmares

2071
02:08:33.04 --> 02:08:39.68
What I have and I wake up in a pool of sweat and it just to get some an alpha brain fueled savage nightmare

2072
02:08:39.68 --> 02:08:43.92
Yeah, don't need that. We're not gonna visit that one hopefully that doesn't happen to you

2073
02:08:43.92 --> 02:08:50.24
But the benefit that I am going to claim and this and it's proven to by the way in a double blind placebo

2074
02:08:50.80 --> 02:08:55.76
Test official alpha brain helps with your like recall like your memory, you know that stuff

2075
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.64
Which that's essentially what it is when you think about it when you forget little that one word boom

2076
02:09:00.64 --> 02:09:03.44
That recall boom boom boom it's just firing. That's how off a brain

2077
02:09:03.68 --> 02:09:07.28
So yeah, if you're about to do something where you got to think and talk a lot which is

2078
02:09:08.24 --> 02:09:12.24
everything get on that alpha brain then you'd be glad you did I I took

2079
02:09:12.24 --> 02:09:18.08
What I used to do a lot so before before I knew how to switch to manual mode regardless

2080
02:09:18.08 --> 02:09:21.60
I would take a pre workout and alpha brain and

2081
02:09:22.88 --> 02:09:28.08
It helped was money. Yeah, I actually got one of my better workouts on that little formula

2082
02:09:28.08 --> 02:09:30.88
So I just kept doing it, but you know how you do something over and over again

2083
02:09:31.36 --> 02:09:35.04
Whether it's physiologically or otherwise you just you tend to lose that

2084
02:09:35.84 --> 02:09:39.60
Yeah, it's like if you take caffeine all the time. Yeah, yes, yeah in a way

2085
02:09:39.60 --> 02:09:44.16
All the same thing. I say alpha brain so I can take it all the time right take it on the regular yeah

2086
02:09:44.16 --> 02:09:49.92
Be in the blood. Yeah, so my more at less that to do with like the the directive effect of alpha brain and my memory and recall

2087
02:09:49.92 --> 02:09:52.24
It was more about the kind of workout I got you know

2088
02:09:52.64 --> 02:09:57.84
So placebo by the way, it's for maybe maybe not though that's the thing or maybe I was just thinking of more cool stuff

2089
02:09:58.32 --> 02:10:02.88
You know, so it's more enjoyable workout could have been that perhaps maybe maybe not

2090
02:10:02.88 --> 02:10:08.40
Not the last mistake to the evidence and the proof you'll recall stuff better

2091
02:10:09.92 --> 02:10:11.92
Remember memorize things better

2092
02:10:12.88 --> 02:10:14.88
Good all day everyday

2093
02:10:15.60 --> 02:10:21.60
Also I got that strong bone remember a few weeks back. Oh, yeah, what does it strong both now?

2094
02:10:21.60 --> 02:10:24.000
You're on that yeah, the facts strong to him

2095
02:10:24.56 --> 02:10:29.76
Those things he's a thing to you read the thing so calcium is that's the that's the the flagship

2096
02:10:29.76 --> 02:10:33.28
The element mineral element whatever

2097
02:10:33.84 --> 02:10:36.24
Calcium that's the one that gets all the credit for your bones

2098
02:10:36.80 --> 02:10:41.36
It's like or you know the strong team is like the stepchild like is for his recognition

2099
02:10:41.36 --> 02:10:47.36
But strong team is super important you lose that you know when you get old in whatever, but that's what that's a strong

2100
02:10:48.08 --> 02:10:53.44
Bone is yeah, you think strong team. Yeah, you think it's strong bone makes your bones strong

2101
02:10:54.16 --> 02:10:57.92
Which I think that's on purpose, dude. It's like a little plan words you think so

2102
02:10:57.92 --> 02:10:59.92
Real no

2103
02:10:59.92 --> 02:11:06.000
How are you smart like that anyway take that strong ball I did it cuz as you know I got by subsidiary

2104
02:11:06.48 --> 02:11:08.64
10 to no mobile I set ripped off my bone

2105
02:11:09.92 --> 02:11:12.88
So if I'm still lift I still do curls whatever I said it

2106
02:11:14.32 --> 02:11:18.40
I don't need that thing ripping off. I don't need 10 the night is I don't need problems. I don't need issues

2107
02:11:19.28 --> 02:11:25.60
Got on that strong bone also I take krill oil jocke. Do you take krill oil affirmative? I think you've been taking krill oil

2108
02:11:25.60 --> 02:11:32.64
longer than I have again and when I say I think it means I know long time even though I've been hearing about great things about krill oil

2109
02:11:34.32 --> 02:11:37.52
From day one so anyway on the krill oil that helps with joints

2110
02:11:38.08 --> 02:11:42.88
It gives you this feel air I said this before I will say it again it gives you this feeling where

2111
02:11:43.28 --> 02:11:45.28
Then this physically it's not emotionally

2112
02:11:46.48 --> 02:11:48.96
Feeling emotional just FYI yeah

2113
02:11:48.96 --> 02:11:56.32
No feeling though if I click your finger you're gonna feel that true so this is yeah, and not all good

2114
02:11:57.20 --> 02:12:04.32
You feel like like if you're sitting down for a long time and then you stand up. Yeah, well you talk about it when I stand

2115
02:12:06.88 --> 02:12:14.16
What I wrote when I stand up well you're on krill oil so you this applies to you when we stand up if Greg train was here

2116
02:12:14.40 --> 02:12:18.16
Like we were like a few weeks ago if Greg train was like he wasn't on the krill oil

2117
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:21.12
We all stand up after the same amount of time two hours

2118
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Ish

2119
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.80
He will be compelled to be like oh

2120
02:12:26.96 --> 02:12:32.96
Make that sound not crazy, but he'll be compelled to make that sound whether he makes it or not he's gonna feel like making it me

2121
02:12:32.96 --> 02:12:36.80
I won't you you won't krill oil makes your joints

2122
02:12:38.40 --> 02:12:40.40
Young again for lack of a better turn

2123
02:12:41.12 --> 02:12:46.96
Anyway, it helps though. Yes, but if you in all seriousness if you are like lifting weights going hard

2124
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:54.40
Yeah, take it all. Yeah, take the krill oil. It'll I mean to where would one get it do that on it dot com if you want

2125
02:12:55.04 --> 02:12:57.84
10% off you go on it dot com slash jacco

2126
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:00.88
It's the best krill oil too. That's the thing you can get

2127
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:03.28
Lane krill oil anywhere

2128
02:13:03.28 --> 02:13:08.64
Maybe not anywhere, but in other places we'll say but the real deal that good stuff is on it

2129
02:13:09.36 --> 02:13:14.80
You don't want to get lame krill oil from name krill. Yeah, you want the hard core of the

2130
02:13:14.80 --> 02:13:19.20
It's true. Do you know how like um like us i e berries? Yeah, you know like you know you

2131
02:13:20.16 --> 02:13:21.52
You can get

2132
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:29.84
junk us i e like the reject us i and paid like cheaper actually this you like krill oil is actually super good price anyway and you get 10% off from on

2133
02:13:30.40 --> 02:13:33.44
slash jacco that's the 10% off for nonetheless back to that say berries

2134
02:13:33.60 --> 02:13:38.64
You can get the junk kind and try to taste junk us i e berries and then taste good us i e berries

2135
02:13:38.80 --> 02:13:41.60
But the difference is like you can tell the difference big time

2136
02:13:41.60 --> 02:13:46.64
It's like night and day same thing with the krill oil take the good on man forget the lame one

2137
02:13:47.84 --> 02:13:52.32
It's just my opinion anyway good another good way to support podcast

2138
02:13:53.04 --> 02:13:56.72
Amazon click through all you do before you do any of your Amazon shopping

2139
02:13:57.60 --> 02:13:59.84
Click through the website jacco's podcast.com

2140
02:14:01.52 --> 02:14:03.52
I got a little hint

2141
02:14:03.52 --> 02:14:05.52
from

2142
02:14:06.32 --> 02:14:08.32
Somebody in the field

2143
02:14:08.32 --> 02:14:14.24
That said hey when you tell people to do Amazon click through what you should tell them is to tell their

2144
02:14:14.56 --> 02:14:16.56
Significant other to click through

2145
02:14:17.36 --> 02:14:22.64
For instance in my case my wife buys more things on Amazon than i do i'm in the game

2146
02:14:23.04 --> 02:14:25.84
I'm supporting the podcast sure but

2147
02:14:26.24 --> 02:14:30.56
What if my wife doesn't know about the click through right she needs to get in the game yeah

2148
02:14:30.56 --> 02:14:33.52
Don't support right there don't just you do it

2149
02:14:34.96 --> 02:14:37.60
Get your family get your wife get your your husband

2150
02:14:37.60 --> 02:14:39.60
Right they're not in the game get him in the game

2151
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:40.96
Yeah, uh

2152
02:14:40.96 --> 02:14:47.84
There's a lot of times yeah a lot of times the other spouse is buying the stuff on Amazon yeah, and they don't know how to support

2153
02:14:48.32 --> 02:14:53.92
Right they don't know about that website or they're just less compelled or they forgot yeah, and you don't really technically

2154
02:14:53.92 --> 02:14:55.92
You don't know if they're forgotten or not, you know

2155
02:14:57.52 --> 02:14:59.52
If you're clever

2156
02:14:59.52 --> 02:15:01.52
heard this from Sam Harris

2157
02:15:01.52 --> 02:15:07.76
I knew this already, I'm be honest, but I heard it to reinforce it or some people they will click through

2158
02:15:08.24 --> 02:15:13.60
And before they do shopping they get that little URL boom save it to favorite save it to to boy call it bookmarks

2159
02:15:13.60 --> 02:15:18.24
But that's on the top so a moment it's there. It's it's in the front of your head now

2160
02:15:19.12 --> 02:15:26.000
It's a good way to support small action takes what three seconds if that if that yeah and huge support

2161
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
It's like huge reinforcement

2162
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.56
Enforcement actually that's all strong supported it is small action bigger reaction

2163
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:37.68
Yeah, like sodium when you throw it in water anyway

2164
02:15:38.48 --> 02:15:41.68

02:16:48.56 --> 02:16:52.40
We're not trying a muzzle anybody I was thinking about a muzzle over here for some of the

2181
02:16:54.80 --> 02:17:00.80
See and it's good that you exercise a no muzzle policy and I think that policy should extend to anyone who's listening

2182
02:17:00.80 --> 02:17:05.76
And want to support this podcast. That's what I think and apparently that's what you think to and I like that obviously

2185
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:23.92
Video version of this podcast is on the YouTube channel which is cool obvious right but with strong recommendations from jockel from others

They recommended that you cut out little excerpts put them on YouTube even make a playlist which I did and did

2188
02:17:34.16 --> 02:17:41.12
I did all of that stuff so there's excerpts on there if you want to listen to three minutes of jockel opinion on what gym what home gym what what

2193
02:17:57.68 --> 02:18:01.92
You can share them easy and people way more likely to listen to little excerpts and the whole thing

You know

2223
02:20:02.96 --> 02:20:06.16
I'm starting to not like the word self improvement

2224
02:20:06.72 --> 02:20:10.88
I already don't like that word right yeah kind of like I'm starting to yeah

2225
02:20:10.88 --> 02:20:16.24
You know, it's kind of like it. Yeah, and I'm to the point I'm like midway through not liking it

2226
02:20:16.24 --> 02:20:22.40
You know the phases is like don't pull me here something like okay that's going acceptable mid phases like that's cool

2227
02:20:22.96 --> 02:20:28.08
But I don't like how it sounds when I said and then the last phase is you don't you just don't want to hear it

2228
02:20:28.08 --> 02:20:33.84
I mean mid phase so but I'm gonna use it, you know for just for the greater good if you're on a self improvement

02:20:56.56 --> 02:20:58.56
Man when you

2238
02:20:58.56 --> 02:21:02.72
And that's the thing that jams people up when they're like hey, I should do this. I should write my ebook or I should

2239
02:21:03.28 --> 02:21:08.48
I should do a journal every day or whatever, you know, and they'll do it one day and then they just won't do it anymore

2240
02:21:08.56 --> 02:21:10.000
You know that's the thing

2241
02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.84
So anyway you've been regardless of what you're doing these tracks like a lot of your part

2242
02:21:14.32 --> 02:21:18.40
These tracks will help you through this at times of weakness

2243
02:21:20.16 --> 02:21:25.68
If you're trying to get up in the morning and it's that day, you know you had a long night and a hard workout that morning

2244
02:21:25.84 --> 02:21:31.68
That you're looking forward to or not looking forward to and you're like you know what I'm gonna just gonna snooze or I'm gonna skip the workout

2245
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:35.60
You listen to a certain one or two or three of these tracks

2246
02:21:35.60 --> 02:21:39.92
It's jacquon who gets you through that moment of weakness and you will workout you will

2247
02:21:40.88 --> 02:21:42.88
Wake up early

2248
02:21:42.88 --> 02:21:46.40
100% probability with very few if any

2249
02:21:46.96 --> 02:21:48.96
exceptions also

2250
02:21:50.56 --> 02:21:57.28
On Amazon the while you're clicking through you can get some jacquoite which has some pretty good effects

2251
02:21:57.28 --> 02:21:59.04
I just pulled a couple of views out

2252
02:21:59.84 --> 02:22:04.56
This one here says drinking jacquo's white tea has had the following effects on my life

2253
02:22:04.56 --> 02:22:07.20
Getting after it up 55%

2254
02:22:08.24 --> 02:22:13.52
Extreme ownership up 92% and also by the way cruising

2255
02:22:14.72 --> 02:22:17.12
Up 108% so that's important

2256
02:22:18.72 --> 02:22:22.72
Also deadlift went from 325 to 555

2257
02:22:23.52 --> 02:22:25.20
20 pullups instead of sets of five

2258
02:22:26.80 --> 02:22:31.20
Solid that's good improvement. I don't think anyone would brush that one in a row instead of instead of

2259
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:33.20
It's at a 5

2260
02:22:33.52 --> 02:22:39.12
There's another person that drank the tea and I thought that this was important because it could happen other people

2261
02:22:39.52 --> 02:22:42.16
Okay, so this person bought some

2262
02:22:42.56 --> 02:22:46.16
Jacquoite tea for myself and my next workout was so aggressive

2263
02:22:46.56 --> 02:22:51.36
I got a strongly worded letter from the UN to see some hostilities so

2264
02:22:52.24 --> 02:22:57.76
I don't like seeing UN involvement on our workouts, but if you're not careful it might happen

2265
02:22:57.76 --> 02:23:01.28
And also there's another person I haven't talked about front squatting

2266
02:23:02.48 --> 02:23:07.76
But you know one person that has been drinking jacquoite is now front squatting about

2267
02:23:08.48 --> 02:23:09.84
2000

2268
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:12.24
So again just jacquoite no big deal

2269
02:23:13.28 --> 02:23:17.04
Double triple quadruple plasibo ultimate tested

2270
02:23:17.68 --> 02:23:19.68
flawless

2271
02:23:19.68 --> 02:23:24.32
Numbers yeah, so yeah jacquoite man tastes good and it is good

2272
02:23:24.32 --> 02:23:28.48
Also right now way of the warrior kid it's out

2273
02:23:29.44 --> 02:23:36.72
We've been waiting for it. I've been waiting for it boom. Thanks everyone for picking it up getting a copy if you haven't gotten it yet

2274
02:23:38.24 --> 02:23:43.68
Get it you know what you probably don't you probably wonder if you need it maybe think you don't need it

2275
02:23:44.64 --> 02:23:45.84
So

2276
02:23:45.84 --> 02:23:49.92
Little extra little extra for you now this is

2277
02:23:50.72 --> 02:23:52.72
Young Mark he couldn't do any pullups

2278
02:23:52.72 --> 02:23:54.72
He couldn't do any pullups

2279
02:23:54.72 --> 02:24:00.24
He's in fifth grade couldn't do any falls get made fun of people are laughing at him because he can't do any

2280
02:24:00.24 --> 02:24:03.20
Pullups his uncle Uncle Jake

2281
02:24:04.24 --> 02:24:07.68
He stays with him for the summer uncle jakes and the sealed teams uncle Jake

2282
02:24:08.40 --> 02:24:11.12
Get some on the workout program what you and I are

2283
02:24:11.44 --> 02:24:13.68
Kind of a little refer to as the program

2284
02:24:14.40 --> 02:24:16.40
Get some on the program and

2285
02:24:16.40 --> 02:24:24.32
It's been a few weeks now an uncle Jake realizes that mark he's been doing negatives and he's been doing assisted pullups

2286
02:24:24.32 --> 02:24:30.08
And he's been doing the pyramids, but just hanging on the bar doing all those things getting ready and Uncle Jake realizes now

2287
02:24:30.08 --> 02:24:36.32
He's ready to do his first pull-up. So he says to him you know, okay, you're gonna get on you're gonna do your first pull-up today

2288
02:24:38.32 --> 02:24:40.32
You'll go to the back to the book

2289
02:24:41.12 --> 02:24:42.48
There you go

2290
02:24:42.48 --> 02:24:44.48
He said get it up

2291
02:24:44.48 --> 02:24:46.48
Get on the bar

2292
02:24:47.04 --> 02:24:53.04
Then here's young mark. I was filled with fear every time I had tried in the past no matter how hard

2293
02:24:53.04 --> 02:24:55.44
I pulled I could never get my chin over the bar

2294
02:24:56.56 --> 02:25:01.60
Now with Uncle Jake standing right here after all the work he has done with me

2295
02:25:01.60 --> 02:25:03.60
I just didn't think I'd be able to do it

2296
02:25:04.72 --> 02:25:06.72
I stood there looking up at the bar

2297
02:25:07.28 --> 02:25:08.64
well

2298
02:25:08.64 --> 02:25:10.24
What are you waiting for?

2299
02:25:10.24 --> 02:25:17.76
Sit Uncle Jake. I slowly stepped up on the box and reached up for the bar the bar was cool in my hands

2300
02:25:18.72 --> 02:25:27.52
And I noticed something that I hadn't thought about my grip in the past my grip always felt like it was gonna slip off the bar my grip felt different now

2301
02:25:28.56 --> 02:25:30.56
It felt strong

2302
02:25:31.20 --> 02:25:37.52
I concentrated and then after taking a big breath I pulled and I went up and

2303
02:25:37.52 --> 02:25:45.60
And up and up and up and soon my chin cleared the top of the bar. Yes, I had done it

2304
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:52.32
I let myself down slowly and dropped off the bar. I looked at my uncle. He had a big smile on his face a big smile

2305
02:25:52.64 --> 02:25:56.96
He was happy and I was even happier if felt so good

2306
02:25:58.08 --> 02:26:00.08
I looked at Uncle Jake and yelled yeah

2307
02:26:00.88 --> 02:26:06.24
As I curl both my fist towards my shoulder like I'd seen weight lifters do in magazines

2308
02:26:06.24 --> 02:26:10.000
And I could actually tell for the first time in my life

2309
02:26:10.56 --> 02:26:18.72
I was starting to get some muscles nothing huge but they were certainly there muscle man mark I shouted as proud as I could be

2310
02:26:20.64 --> 02:26:23.12
Then I saw Uncle Jake smile disappear

2311
02:26:24.32 --> 02:26:26.32
Hold on there muscle man

2312
02:26:26.56 --> 02:26:33.04
Said Uncle Jake. I didn't know what was wrong but something was I think it's a bit early for a celebration

2313
02:26:33.04 --> 02:26:39.60
Early I just did the first pull-up of my life. I think it's the perfect time for a celebration

2314
02:26:39.60 --> 02:26:41.60
I told Uncle Jake

2315
02:26:42.24 --> 02:26:43.60
That's a problem

2316
02:26:43.60 --> 02:26:47.04
Uncle Jake said a problem. Why is a pull-up a problem?

2317
02:26:48.24 --> 02:26:50.24
Not the pull-up mark the celebration

2318
02:26:50.80 --> 02:26:52.80
It is way too early for celebrating

2319
02:26:53.44 --> 02:26:55.44
But I just did my first pull-up ever

2320
02:26:56.40 --> 02:26:58.40
But your goal isn't one pull-up

2321
02:26:58.40 --> 02:27:01.84
Your goal is ten pull-ups you did one

2322
02:27:02.96 --> 02:27:07.12
Sure you have a reason to be happy one pull-up is better than zero

2323
02:27:07.60 --> 02:27:09.12
But it's a long way from ten

2324
02:27:10.72 --> 02:27:17.44
No matter what you're doing in life you can't take your eyes off the long-term goal especially to celebrate

2325
02:27:18.80 --> 02:27:22.08
You can assess you can try and figure out some lessons learned

2326
02:27:22.64 --> 02:27:27.92
From what you did right and what you did wrong you can even do a little celebrating for the small

2327
02:27:27.92 --> 02:27:29.12
victories

2328
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:31.68
But don't go overboard

2329
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:39.20
You need to keep your head in the game so come over here give me a high five and then get back over there and start doing more work on the pull-up bar

2330
02:27:40.16 --> 02:27:42.16
This is only the beginning

2331
02:27:42.80 --> 02:27:46.16
I walked over to Uncle Jake who brought his hand up in the air

2332
02:27:47.12 --> 02:27:50.96
I slapped it hard and he said solid work

2333
02:27:51.68 --> 02:27:54.72
Now get back over there and get after it

2334
02:27:54.72 --> 02:27:57.28
Yes, sir, I told him

2335
02:27:59.44 --> 02:28:03.04
Just a little another little lesson from Uncle Jake you can't get

2336
02:28:03.28 --> 02:28:07.28
Carke when you make the little cheap minge got to keep your eye on the ball so that's it

2337
02:28:09.44 --> 02:28:12.64
Check out that book order it way the warrior kid

2338
02:28:13.52 --> 02:28:15.36
It's a kids book that's what they're telling me

2339
02:28:16.16 --> 02:28:19.60
I think we all learn a little something from it. I know I learned from writing it

2340
02:28:19.60 --> 02:28:25.04
You can also pre-a-boarder a book called Discipline equals freedom field manual

2341
02:28:26.72 --> 02:28:30.16
And it's we're dilinating it right now. It's gonna come out October 17th

2342
02:28:30.80 --> 02:28:32.80
It isn't a workout book

2343
02:28:33.76 --> 02:28:39.28
It isn't a philosophy book. It isn't a photography book. It isn't a diet book

2344
02:28:41.44 --> 02:28:44.16
It's got all those things in there, but how do you categorize it?

2345
02:28:44.16 --> 02:28:49.76
Where are you gonna put where you gonna put it in the bookstore? Where's it gonna be? Where's it gonna be on Amazon?

2346
02:28:49.84 --> 02:28:51.84

Thanks to everybody for listening and for supporting and for asking these questions and for helping us do what we do

2371
02:30:53.44 --> 02:30:55.44
to the military personnel overseas

2372
02:30:57.44 --> 02:30:59.28
All of you

Our deepest thanks and appreciation for your service and sacrifice stay safe

2374
02:31:06.80 --> 02:31:09.44
The best way to stay safe is to stay aggressive

2375
02:31:09.44 --> 02:31:14.32
To the police firefighters EMTs first responders

2376
02:31:15.60 --> 02:31:21.44
Thanks for staying sharp training hard and standing watch for us here at home

2377

And to everybody listening

2378
02:31:28.56 --> 02:31:31.04
Life isn't easy

2379
02:31:32.88 --> 02:31:34.24
And it's not supposed to be

2380
02:31:34.24 --> 02:31:41.60
Sure there's victories and there's triumphs but there's also losses and setbacks

2381
02:31:44.40 --> 02:31:49.60
But those losses and setbacks only win if you let them

2382
02:31:52.96 --> 02:31:54.96
So don't let them

2383
02:31:56.08 --> 02:31:59.44
Don't let them win no matter what happens

2384
02:31:59.44 --> 02:32:03.44
Keep going

2385
02:32:04.16 --> 02:32:06.16
Keep getting after it

2386
02:32:07.68 --> 02:32:09.68
