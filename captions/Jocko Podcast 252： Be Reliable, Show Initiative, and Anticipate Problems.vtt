00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80
This is Jockelpontcast number 252 with Dave Burke and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80
Good evening Dave.

3
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:10.80
Good evening.

4
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:17.04
EchoTrolls is taking care of some other business on the last podcast.

5
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.60
Number 251 with Lave Babin.

6
00:00:20.60 --> 00:00:26.92
We started getting into the book guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce

7
00:00:26.92 --> 00:00:27.92
Clark.

8
00:00:27.92 --> 00:00:33.72
We only made it 13 pages into and a half hours and it's a 117 page book.

9
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:38.16
Just to recap a little bit, this is a book that I searched for for over a decade.

10
00:00:38.16 --> 00:00:44.04
I originally heard about this book in my favorite book, which is called About Face by Colonel

11
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:45.20
David Hackworth.

12
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:50.32
I finally found a copy a month and a half ago.

13
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:52.48
And so here we are just a little background.

14
00:00:52.48 --> 00:00:55.32
Once again on General Bruce Clark.

15
00:00:55.32 --> 00:00:59.92
Number 21 World War II Korea, and listed in 1917, and they have gone to West Point, Colonel

16
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:03.96
World War II, then a general commanded the Fourth Armored Division in Patton's Third

17
00:01:03.96 --> 00:01:13.64
Army, Battle of the Bulge, Distinguished Service Cross, Three Silver Stars, 45 years of service.

18
00:01:13.64 --> 00:01:18.80
And then spend a bunch of time not only leading troops, but also training troops, or overseeing

19
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:19.92
training commands.

20
00:01:19.92 --> 00:01:26.92
So awesome career, Hackworth talked about him glowingly in the book about face.

21
00:01:26.92 --> 00:01:31.44
And that's where the start of taking me a long time to find this book.

22
00:01:31.44 --> 00:01:36.24
Who did somebody texted me about it and said it was the white whale.

23
00:01:36.24 --> 00:01:38.16
Like, you know, this was that it was.

24
00:01:38.16 --> 00:01:40.92
Definitely hard for me to find this book, but we have it.

25
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:41.92
And that's it.

26
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:42.92
That's what we're going to do.

27
00:01:42.92 --> 00:01:44.48
We're going to go back into this book.

28
00:01:44.48 --> 00:01:50.84
So here we go back into guidelines for the leader and commander by Bruce General Bruce

29
00:01:50.84 --> 00:01:52.68
C. Clark.

30
00:01:52.68 --> 00:02:00.32
So this section starts off with administration, some thoughts for the commander.

31
00:02:00.32 --> 00:02:06.40
And he says, insumation, I would like to point out the close interrelationship between

32
00:02:06.40 --> 00:02:10.56
training programs and sound overall management.

33
00:02:10.56 --> 00:02:15.96
So this is something, you know, when you're that young, gun-hole leader, that's just

34
00:02:15.96 --> 00:02:20.40
things, hey, where you're to operate, whatever that operation is, whether it's shoot machine

35
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:23.88
guns or whether that's out, selling things or making things.

36
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:26.04
And you think, hey, I'm on the front line.

37
00:02:26.04 --> 00:02:27.48
I'm going to make things happen.

38
00:02:27.48 --> 00:02:31.36
And you think all the administrative stuff you shouldn't have to worry about.

39
00:02:31.36 --> 00:02:34.56
That's not me.

40
00:02:34.56 --> 00:02:37.84
And I know many individuals that are like that.

41
00:02:37.84 --> 00:02:42.40
I know one individual in particular, that's like that whose name is Jockel.

42
00:02:42.40 --> 00:02:44.96
Because I was definitely like that.

43
00:02:44.96 --> 00:02:49.12
Many commanders, I was like that when I was younger.

44
00:02:49.12 --> 00:02:53.28
Because I absolutely, I'd realize this and you can hear, you know, we'll talk about the

45
00:02:53.28 --> 00:02:57.88
paperwork drills that we had to do and how life and Seth came to me.

46
00:02:57.88 --> 00:02:58.88
We should not have to do this stuff.

47
00:02:58.88 --> 00:02:59.88
And I said, oh, we're going to do it.

48
00:02:59.88 --> 00:03:01.68
We're going to do it better than anybody else.

49
00:03:01.68 --> 00:03:07.32
So I figured this out, but it is definitely a learning moment that people have.

50
00:03:07.32 --> 00:03:09.20
And so why not learn it right now.

51
00:03:09.20 --> 00:03:11.64
Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.

52
00:03:11.64 --> 00:03:13.84
Imagine that.

53
00:03:13.84 --> 00:03:15.16
This is that statement.

54
00:03:15.16 --> 00:03:18.68
Many commanders are defeated by poor administration.

55
00:03:18.68 --> 00:03:22.36
Not defeated because they were tactfully on sound, not defeated because they made bad decisions,

56
00:03:22.36 --> 00:03:24.76
not defeated because they couldn't come up with a good plan.

57
00:03:24.76 --> 00:03:31.64
They just fail because they're administrative losers.

58
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:36.20
Without sound administration, a commander cannot succeed in his training and maintenance programs.

59
00:03:36.20 --> 00:03:40.52
The administration is nothing more than applied common sense.

60
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:45.96
I'm including here a number of items that may well be considered a checklist of indicators

61
00:03:45.96 --> 00:03:49.24
of sound administration.

62
00:03:49.24 --> 00:03:54.92
Number one, importance of time.

63
00:03:54.92 --> 00:03:59.64
The principal coordinating device in the army is time.

64
00:03:59.64 --> 00:04:04.44
Learn the proper time space factors so you can be on time and make reasonable demands

65
00:04:04.44 --> 00:04:06.16
of your subordinates.

66
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:15.16
So that's number one by the way, which is probably why you hear a lot of talk about time management.

67
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:18.40
Just think about the idea that the first thing he's going to say is time.

68
00:04:18.40 --> 00:04:23.92
This is someone who clearly understands that of all the resources in the world that we have.

69
00:04:23.92 --> 00:04:27.80
That's the one that matters the most because we just can't produce more of that.

70
00:04:27.80 --> 00:04:30.40
I was going to say it's the one that matters the most.

71
00:04:30.40 --> 00:04:32.92
And it's the absolute one that we have the least control.

72
00:04:32.92 --> 00:04:34.24
You know how much control do we have time?

73
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:35.000
You have zero.

74
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.92
You cannot stop it. You cannot bring it back.

75
00:04:36.92 --> 00:04:39.04
You got to say, I have the power curve.

76
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:41.04
I hate that feeling.

77
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:42.16
I hate that feeling.

78
00:04:42.16 --> 00:04:45.08
And let me tell you what.

79
00:04:45.08 --> 00:04:46.28
I realize this a while back.

80
00:04:46.28 --> 00:04:51.20
So when you go to the airport, if you show up to the airport late,

81
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:54.92
and now look, TSA doesn't care that your late.

82
00:04:54.92 --> 00:04:57.68
The baggage handler doesn't care that your late.

83
00:04:57.68 --> 00:05:00.60
The Uber driver does not care what time your plane is leaving.

84
00:05:00.60 --> 00:05:02.76
They're doing what they're doing.

85
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:08.56
And so what that does is it takes you have no control over that time once it started to

86
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:09.24
commence.

87
00:05:09.24 --> 00:05:10.56
What do you have control over?

88
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:12.000
Going to the airport a little bit earlier.

89
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.76
That's all.

90
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:13.28
That's all.

91
00:05:13.28 --> 00:05:14.28
Not that big of a deal.

92
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:15.88
Go to the airport a little bit earlier.

93
00:05:15.88 --> 00:05:17.28
And you won't have to worry about TSA.

94
00:05:17.28 --> 00:05:18.32
You won't have to worry about baggage.

95
00:05:18.32 --> 00:05:22.52
You won't have to worry about how long it takes for the Uber driver or the lift.

96
00:05:22.52 --> 00:05:28.88
Let's give proper credit or lift driver to show up and bring you to the airport.

97
00:05:28.88 --> 00:05:34.16
So how do you get control? You can't control time once it's unfolding.

98
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:35.44
You can't bring it back.

99
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:39.52
You have to plan for it appropriately.

100
00:05:39.52 --> 00:05:41.76
And there's a sense of urgency.

101
00:05:41.76 --> 00:05:44.08
And I don't have a pretty good sense of urgency.

102
00:05:44.08 --> 00:05:46.08
And you may or may not.

103
00:05:46.08 --> 00:05:50.80
I know like at the master, especially the earlier musters when we weren't when the

104
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:54.36
backside wasn't quite the well-oiled machine that it is now.

105
00:05:54.36 --> 00:05:58.24
And certainly as a well-oiled machine now, the early musters, it was not a well-oiled

106
00:05:58.24 --> 00:05:58.76
machine.

107
00:05:58.76 --> 00:06:04.76
On the front side, people wouldn't know that when life and I were walking out on stage

108
00:06:04.76 --> 00:06:09.24
at eight o'clock in the morning, we had two hours of sleep because we had to do so whatever

109
00:06:09.24 --> 00:06:10.48
we had to do behind the scenes.

110
00:06:10.48 --> 00:06:13.000
And that's just the way it was.

111
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.12
I can feel when the shortage of time.

112
00:06:18.12 --> 00:06:21.88
In fact, I think I feel the shortage of time every single day, every single waking

113
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:25.52
minute.

114
00:06:25.52 --> 00:06:28.72
There's a thing that happened at some point in my life.

115
00:06:28.72 --> 00:06:30.08
I don't know what when that was.

116
00:06:30.08 --> 00:06:31.24
But I still think about it now.

117
00:06:31.24 --> 00:06:33.92
When you were just talking about the feeling, what I thought you were going to talk about

118
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:36.96
is the feeling of when you feel like you don't have enough time to do something.

119
00:06:36.96 --> 00:06:41.32
So being later or whatever, or how I got stuff I needed to prepare for, it used to be

120
00:06:41.32 --> 00:06:44.32
that I used to feel that it wasn't enough time.

121
00:06:44.32 --> 00:06:47.84
And the feeling that makes me sick now is at any time I'm behind.

122
00:06:47.84 --> 00:06:48.84
Which happens.

123
00:06:48.84 --> 00:06:49.84
I look at like, man, I'm behind.

124
00:06:49.84 --> 00:06:50.84
I didn't get enough done here.

125
00:06:50.84 --> 00:06:51.84
I didn't prep enough here.

126
00:06:51.84 --> 00:06:56.28
Feeling that bothers me the most is looking back on the time that I wasted the day before

127
00:06:56.28 --> 00:06:59.76
or the week before when I thought, hey, this is now I need to get ahead.

128
00:06:59.76 --> 00:07:00.76
I got a little window.

129
00:07:00.76 --> 00:07:03.64
I got some white space here, which is actually pretty rare.

130
00:07:03.64 --> 00:07:07.20
And I look back on the time that I wasted, which is very different than there isn't

131
00:07:07.20 --> 00:07:08.20
enough time.

132
00:07:08.20 --> 00:07:11.92
I honestly don't think I've ever felt like I didn't have enough time.

133
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:15.20
I always feel like I have wasted time.

134
00:07:15.20 --> 00:07:19.74
And that feeling of when I'm behind or unprepared, man, that drives me nuts as I look

135
00:07:19.74 --> 00:07:22.70
back on what did I do yesterday or the day before?

136
00:07:22.70 --> 00:07:27.30
How did I waste so much time knowing that I can't get that back?

137
00:07:27.30 --> 00:07:28.58
And that's the feeling that bothers me.

138
00:07:28.58 --> 00:07:32.38
I think more than any other feeling is I wasted my time.

139
00:07:32.38 --> 00:07:34.50
Yeah, that's a, that is a doozy.

140
00:07:34.50 --> 00:07:38.78
And this is, by the way, item number one.

141
00:07:38.78 --> 00:07:42.46
Item number one, importance of time.

142
00:07:42.46 --> 00:07:44.70
Next, anticipate problems.

143
00:07:44.70 --> 00:07:49.18
Troublesome incidents or situations can be avoided if the probable consequences of existing

144
00:07:49.18 --> 00:07:53.02
conditions are previously anticipated.

145
00:07:53.02 --> 00:07:58.70
Incidents do not occur until the stage has been set for some time.

146
00:07:58.70 --> 00:08:04.38
The outstanding officer knows where things are likely to go wrong and plans preventive

147
00:08:04.38 --> 00:08:07.46
action.

148
00:08:07.46 --> 00:08:13.78
Spend a little bit of time thinking of through contingencies and then come up with a plan.

149
00:08:13.78 --> 00:08:16.50
And you don't even have to come up with this elaborate plan.

150
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:24.58
You just have to know what you're going to do in a broad sense.

151
00:08:24.58 --> 00:08:28.18
Next, personality of the commander.

152
00:08:28.18 --> 00:08:32.58
Personality of the commander has an enormous influence on his unit.

153
00:08:32.58 --> 00:08:38.50
In fact, the unit may be said to be nothing but an extension of the commander's personality.

154
00:08:38.50 --> 00:08:44.74
It is essential that he makes his presence felt by leaving his desk to appear where work

155
00:08:44.74 --> 00:08:52.98
and training go on and by talking to and knowing and influencing his men.

156
00:08:52.98 --> 00:08:55.42
How many times did you see that in the Marine Corps?

157
00:08:55.42 --> 00:08:57.78
How about going for like checking into a squadron?

158
00:08:57.78 --> 00:09:00.86
How much would the squadron reflect the commander of the squadron?

159
00:09:00.86 --> 00:09:01.86
Completely.

160
00:09:01.86 --> 00:09:04.42
I mean, that was the always the ultimate difference.

161
00:09:04.42 --> 00:09:07.94
Because the thing about squadrons, it's probably true in a seal team, is that if you look

162
00:09:07.94 --> 00:09:10.50
at the squadrons from the outside, I was base at Miramar.

163
00:09:10.50 --> 00:09:13.54
There were seven F-18 squadrons when I was there.

164
00:09:13.54 --> 00:09:15.78
One paper that are all identical.

165
00:09:15.78 --> 00:09:16.78
Same equipment.

166
00:09:16.78 --> 00:09:19.10
Same not every metric that you would measure it.

167
00:09:19.10 --> 00:09:20.10
It's all the same.

168
00:09:20.10 --> 00:09:24.02
There isn't one squadron, like they get better stuff or better people.

169
00:09:24.02 --> 00:09:26.94
They just get the same thing that everybody else gets.

170
00:09:26.94 --> 00:09:30.82
And the only difference was obviously the commander or the leader and the squadrons would

171
00:09:30.82 --> 00:09:34.06
take on those personalities.

172
00:09:34.06 --> 00:09:36.66
Almost immediately when the new commander take over.

173
00:09:36.66 --> 00:09:41.30
It's not, it's crazy.

174
00:09:41.30 --> 00:09:42.30
It's crazy.

175
00:09:42.30 --> 00:09:45.14
It's just an extension of the boat crew story and extreme ownership.

176
00:09:45.14 --> 00:09:46.14
Hey, we swap out.

177
00:09:46.14 --> 00:09:48.94
We put in a good leader into this boat crew that's failing and all of a sudden you've

178
00:09:48.94 --> 00:09:52.78
got this totally legit boat crew that's winning.

179
00:09:52.78 --> 00:09:53.78
And that happens.

180
00:09:53.78 --> 00:09:55.50
How many people in a squadron?

181
00:09:55.50 --> 00:09:56.50
200.

182
00:09:56.50 --> 00:09:57.86
200 people.

183
00:09:57.86 --> 00:09:58.86
How many aircraft?

184
00:09:58.86 --> 00:09:59.86
12.

185
00:09:59.86 --> 00:10:00.86
12 aircraft.

186
00:10:00.86 --> 00:10:01.86
200 people.

187
00:10:01.86 --> 00:10:02.86
And boom.

188
00:10:02.86 --> 00:10:04.62
You put a good leader in there.

189
00:10:04.62 --> 00:10:06.02
But I will say this, though.

190
00:10:06.02 --> 00:10:07.86
Well, you can correct me if I'm wrong.

191
00:10:07.86 --> 00:10:19.90
But the Marine Corps from my experience has a tighter group, a tighter variance on their

192
00:10:19.90 --> 00:10:25.98
officers than, well, then certainly in the sealed teams.

193
00:10:25.98 --> 00:10:29.22
So in other words, you might get in the sealed teams.

194
00:10:29.22 --> 00:10:32.42
You might get these outstanding officers.

195
00:10:32.42 --> 00:10:35.90
And then you'd get some really good officers, some solid officers that kind of like the

196
00:10:35.90 --> 00:10:36.90
normal.

197
00:10:36.90 --> 00:10:38.26
You have some really kick ass guys.

198
00:10:38.26 --> 00:10:39.42
You have a bunch of normal guys.

199
00:10:39.42 --> 00:10:43.54
And then you have the bottom group, which would be pretty outside the range.

200
00:10:43.54 --> 00:10:45.50
So the range would be pretty big.

201
00:10:45.50 --> 00:10:48.86
It seemed to me like the Marine Corps always had just tight.

202
00:10:48.86 --> 00:10:49.86
It's more controlled.

203
00:10:49.86 --> 00:10:51.14
It's a more controlled group.

204
00:10:51.14 --> 00:10:53.58
It's a tighter group.

205
00:10:53.58 --> 00:11:00.14
Maybe the high end is not as often that you're going to get some just guy that's outside

206
00:11:00.14 --> 00:11:02.14
the box of stellar.

207
00:11:02.14 --> 00:11:05.30
Look, maybe I don't know.

208
00:11:05.30 --> 00:11:06.66
But I do know this.

209
00:11:06.66 --> 00:11:12.94
The chances of having a Marine Corps platoon commander that doesn't meet the grade isn't

210
00:11:12.94 --> 00:11:15.54
very low.

211
00:11:15.54 --> 00:11:19.82
And in the sealed teams, it would happen more often because there's more slack.

212
00:11:19.82 --> 00:11:20.98
There's more room.

213
00:11:20.98 --> 00:11:22.98
You're giving more rope to hang yourself.

214
00:11:22.98 --> 00:11:24.26
And you give guys rope.

215
00:11:24.26 --> 00:11:27.38
And they can take that rope and they can turn it into something awesome or they can

216
00:11:27.38 --> 00:11:29.02
make it hang themselves.

217
00:11:29.02 --> 00:11:31.82
I always kind of notice that.

218
00:11:31.82 --> 00:11:36.82
Yeah, I think that's right.

219
00:11:36.82 --> 00:11:39.90
And when you're inside that, the disparity or that variance becomes more evident to you as

220
00:11:39.90 --> 00:11:41.06
you're inside that.

221
00:11:41.06 --> 00:11:42.06
And you can see that.

222
00:11:42.06 --> 00:11:43.70
So there still is a variance.

223
00:11:43.70 --> 00:11:48.02
And when we looked at good squadrons or bad squadrons, however you wanted to define that,

224
00:11:48.02 --> 00:11:50.46
a lot of times it was kind of just a feeling.

225
00:11:50.46 --> 00:11:54.82
Almost like an intangible quality of that's a good squadron and that's a bad squadron.

226
00:11:54.82 --> 00:11:58.18
And the way we judge that was how did there people acted?

227
00:11:58.18 --> 00:11:59.98
And other people acted?

228
00:11:59.98 --> 00:12:02.94
A reflection of their leadership puts exactly what he just said.

229
00:12:02.94 --> 00:12:07.74
And the squadrons would take on the persona and the personality of their leaders and the

230
00:12:07.74 --> 00:12:10.10
good leaders had good squadrons.

231
00:12:10.10 --> 00:12:15.46
And the bad leaders, or the leaders that weren't as good, their squadrons reflected that.

232
00:12:15.46 --> 00:12:17.34
So you got 12 aircraft.

233
00:12:17.34 --> 00:12:22.10
And then are those aircraft broken up into sections or platoon somehow?

234
00:12:22.10 --> 00:12:24.14
Or is it just every man for himself?

235
00:12:24.14 --> 00:12:27.30
No, I mean, they had 12 aircraft that didn't theory were all the same.

236
00:12:27.30 --> 00:12:28.86
You know, they weren't all fliable at a time.

237
00:12:28.86 --> 00:12:30.82
But no, we wouldn't break them down.

238
00:12:30.82 --> 00:12:34.90
We would fly an element sometimes at two or a four ship, but the aircraft were just rotated

239
00:12:34.90 --> 00:12:37.74
through so you could be in any given aircraft on any day.

240
00:12:37.74 --> 00:12:44.50
So in a seal platoon, you could have a great officer.

241
00:12:44.50 --> 00:12:45.66
And you could have a great platoon.

242
00:12:45.66 --> 00:12:53.66
You could also have a great platoon chief or a great leading pettioser or a system platoon commander

243
00:12:53.66 --> 00:12:56.02
chances are you're not going to get a pipe hitting system.

244
00:12:56.02 --> 00:12:59.06
So you can get some really solid guys, but they just don't have to experience it.

245
00:12:59.06 --> 00:13:06.26
So basically what you needed was ah, ah, singular, really good leader.

246
00:13:06.26 --> 00:13:11.02
Didn't necessarily need to be the top guy, but somebody, you know, at a seal team, you

247
00:13:11.02 --> 00:13:14.22
might have a great seal team commanding officer.

248
00:13:14.22 --> 00:13:17.58
You also might have, and that could really make the whole seal team great.

249
00:13:17.58 --> 00:13:23.78
You could also have a great seal team command master chief who is a kickass guy.

250
00:13:23.78 --> 00:13:27.38
You could have a great seal, uh, ops master chief.

251
00:13:27.38 --> 00:13:35.50
So as long as you had one of these guys in the team that was legit badass, you could

252
00:13:35.50 --> 00:13:36.94
you're going to pull it off.

253
00:13:36.94 --> 00:13:38.66
Unless you get somebody that's an idiot in there too.

254
00:13:38.66 --> 00:13:42.46
If you get somebody with a big ego, you know, the command master chief has a big

255
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:46.26
ego or the commanding officer has a big ego and also you got conflict, then you know, all

256
00:13:46.26 --> 00:13:48.70
bets are off and we got man.

257
00:13:48.70 --> 00:13:53.78
But chances are if you got one good leader, you're going to, you're going to, the, the, the

258
00:13:53.78 --> 00:13:55.90
group will take on the personality of the commander.

259
00:13:55.90 --> 00:13:59.30
So if you don't like the personality of your team, guess what?

260
00:13:59.30 --> 00:14:01.66
Ha, go look in the mirror.

261
00:14:01.66 --> 00:14:06.58
Next, counseling of individuals at the company level, the commander and the champion of

262
00:14:06.58 --> 00:14:12.58
the ones to whom the men will come for guidance when they have to, when they have or think

263
00:14:12.58 --> 00:14:14.34
they have problems.

264
00:14:14.34 --> 00:14:20.86
Discamanders are usually surprised, the number of men who actually have real personal difficulties.

265
00:14:20.86 --> 00:14:25.62
These may take a variety of forms, money troubles, family difficulties, disciplinary problems,

266
00:14:25.62 --> 00:14:28.14
character weaknesses and spiritual conflicts.

267
00:14:28.14 --> 00:14:30.06
The commander's problem is too old.

268
00:14:30.06 --> 00:14:34.74
First, he must train himself to recognize and to look for the early signs that identify

269
00:14:34.74 --> 00:14:36.78
a man with problems.

270
00:14:36.78 --> 00:14:42.74
Early recognition of a problem, like timely diagnosis of a disease makes the treatment and

271
00:14:42.74 --> 00:14:45.34
cure easier.

272
00:14:45.34 --> 00:14:51.42
Second, having identified the problem, the commander must take the proper steps to correct it,

273
00:14:51.42 --> 00:14:54.54
often his own counseling will have to be sufficient.

274
00:14:54.54 --> 00:14:57.18
But in other cases, he left a call on others for help.

275
00:14:57.18 --> 00:15:00.18
Here is the central that the correct source be used.

276
00:15:00.18 --> 00:15:05.06
That the man who's pay record is incorrect, shouldn't be sent to the chaplain, but to

277
00:15:05.06 --> 00:15:06.06
the finance clerk.

278
00:15:06.06 --> 00:15:07.06
All right.

279
00:15:07.06 --> 00:15:10.10
So we're, we're, we're making sure that we identify problems.

280
00:15:10.10 --> 00:15:12.86
We have to look for that.

281
00:15:12.86 --> 00:15:16.18
This has always been a problem for me because no one ever tells me anything when something's

282
00:15:16.18 --> 00:15:18.18
going wrong.

283
00:15:18.18 --> 00:15:23.34
No one wants to tell me that they're overworked or they don't want to do another operation

284
00:15:23.34 --> 00:15:24.34
or whatever.

285
00:15:24.34 --> 00:15:25.50
No one ever wants to tell me that.

286
00:15:25.50 --> 00:15:27.34
So I have to drag it out of people.

287
00:15:27.34 --> 00:15:31.30
I have to have intel sources that will tell me that the troops are getting tired or the

288
00:15:31.30 --> 00:15:35.06
guys are worn out or whatever.

289
00:15:35.06 --> 00:15:36.54
Recognition of outstanding work.

290
00:15:36.54 --> 00:15:38.26
This is the next section.

291
00:15:38.26 --> 00:15:42.26
Make sure way to instill loyal to you to recognize outstanding work from your subordinates.

292
00:15:42.26 --> 00:15:49.70
Satisfaction in a job well done as a trait of all men and recognition by others of the same

293
00:15:49.70 --> 00:15:55.30
good work will appeal to the vanity that lies in all of us.

294
00:15:55.30 --> 00:15:58.06
Another thing I'm bad at.

295
00:15:58.06 --> 00:16:01.54
I'm horrible at recognizing people for good work.

296
00:16:01.54 --> 00:16:08.18
I just think everyone's doing what they should be doing and it's very seldom that I

297
00:16:08.18 --> 00:16:12.14
take the time to like think somebody I usually have to think about it.

298
00:16:12.14 --> 00:16:14.50
I'm horrible at that.

299
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:19.70
Life has told me though that when I would say something that someone did good they'd

300
00:16:19.70 --> 00:16:24.58
be super stoked that if we go would be fired up.

301
00:16:24.58 --> 00:16:25.58
Recognition can take many forms.

302
00:16:25.58 --> 00:16:29.10
Decorations letters of commendation or a acknowledgement of formation or the issuance

303
00:16:29.10 --> 00:16:34.18
of a three day pass but whatever the form is essential that the commander is a commander

304
00:16:34.18 --> 00:16:38.54
be alert to outstanding performance and give timely public recognition when it is due.

305
00:16:38.54 --> 00:16:41.46
Can I just what about just a simple head nod?

306
00:16:41.46 --> 00:16:42.46
Is that work?

307
00:16:42.46 --> 00:16:43.46
Yeah that can work man.

308
00:16:43.46 --> 00:16:48.34
I mean part of that is you got to pay attention to what matters to your people and you know

309
00:16:48.34 --> 00:16:50.74
the thing that I always craved the most the recognition.

310
00:16:50.74 --> 00:16:51.74
I didn't.

311
00:16:51.74 --> 00:16:57.94
The recognition I wanted was to be left alone and if my leadership didn't when my leadership

312
00:16:57.94 --> 00:17:02.34
wasn't micromanaging me and giving me the flexibility that that was him okay I must be

313
00:17:02.34 --> 00:17:03.86
doing something right.

314
00:17:03.86 --> 00:17:08.82
Cool we're good but there's nothing wrong with the recognition.

315
00:17:08.82 --> 00:17:12.66
I'm not trying to pile on the idea of like don't acknowledge your people's good work but

316
00:17:12.66 --> 00:17:16.86
what matters to somebody doesn't always matter to everybody and you got to actually pay

317
00:17:16.86 --> 00:17:22.74
attention what matters and over time the the head nod and keep doing what you're doing

318
00:17:22.74 --> 00:17:24.10
dude that's good to go.

319
00:17:24.10 --> 00:17:30.74
Yeah you know I had trouble with this because and I still do because you know when

320
00:17:30.74 --> 00:17:38.66
you're the boss right well in my mind you know if I say hey Dave good job I just I think

321
00:17:38.66 --> 00:17:42.50
you don't care about that because I'm just some other guy that's trying to work hard whatever

322
00:17:42.50 --> 00:17:48.42
and I remember I've told the story before I was first got to Ramadi needed a certain type

323
00:17:48.42 --> 00:17:55.10
of laptop computer for my office and the radio guy the IT guy the radio man guy who's

324
00:17:55.10 --> 00:17:59.50
a great dude I told him hey I need to have I need to have a zipper and a nipper laptop

325
00:17:59.50 --> 00:18:03.58
side by side and he's okay we don't really have enough nipper these are I need a classified

326
00:18:03.58 --> 00:18:09.26
computer and an unclassified computer side by side so that when I was working I could if I

327
00:18:09.26 --> 00:18:14.22
needed some information that was from the unclassified side I could look it up if and and

328
00:18:14.22 --> 00:18:17.10
then continue to work on whatever else working on.

329
00:18:17.10 --> 00:18:23.34
So I remember I said hey I called him into the tech operations and I said hey I want a

330
00:18:23.34 --> 00:18:26.70
classified computer here and an unclassified computer here and he goes well we don't really

331
00:18:26.70 --> 00:18:32.54
have enough unclassified computers and I kind of went okay and then a few minutes later I

332
00:18:32.54 --> 00:18:38.94
walked through the the chow haul and we had set up this unclassified computer station with

333
00:18:38.94 --> 00:18:43.98
six computers for everyone to use now everyone had computers in their tent too this wasn't

334
00:18:43.98 --> 00:18:49.02
like you know everyone was lined up to use these six computers no it was just somebody decided

335
00:18:49.02 --> 00:18:52.62
hey we'll put some internet computers out here and so I walked out there said wait a second

336
00:18:52.62 --> 00:18:56.30
we have all these unclassified computers right here and I went back and said hey man those

337
00:18:56.30 --> 00:19:00.86
computers that other get one to me and he was like oh Roger that and I realized oh I need to

338
00:19:00.86 --> 00:19:08.46
make the call on that and what I say has impact you know and so when you say something negative

339
00:19:08.46 --> 00:19:11.90
it has a big impact because you know sometimes I say that that plan doesn't make any sense

340
00:19:11.90 --> 00:19:15.58
and everyone just be well be quiet because they think that you don't like the plan

341
00:19:15.98 --> 00:19:20.62
when reality is you're just thinking maybe I could come up with a different plan so you got

342
00:19:20.62 --> 00:19:25.58
the overall and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics your words have power and

343
00:19:25.58 --> 00:19:31.10
impact so remembering that when you give someone some compliments it may have some it has as

344
00:19:31.10 --> 00:19:40.94
more significance than you might think efficiency reports I was I was thinking myself when I saw

345
00:19:40.94 --> 00:19:43.90
this I was like I you know I'll kind of skip over this who cares you know no one wants to hear

346
00:19:43.90 --> 00:19:51.34
about efficiency reports then I read it nice it oh I will absolutely include this with the

347
00:19:51.34 --> 00:19:57.42
advent of enlisted efficiency reports the command so efficiency reports so for in the civilian

348
00:19:57.42 --> 00:20:01.66
sector with the suit boiled down to you know unvaluations are performance evaluation for someone

349
00:20:03.02 --> 00:20:08.30
the commander now has a new tool which will assist him in gaining the desired motivation from

350
00:20:08.30 --> 00:20:15.18
his key enlisted personnel too often the efficiency report becomes the padlock on the barn door

351
00:20:15.18 --> 00:20:23.10
after the horse has been stolen what a great way to think about wasting some kind of evaluation

352
00:20:23.10 --> 00:20:28.06
format performance evaluation hey Dave you went and did something for a year you did your job

353
00:20:28.06 --> 00:20:33.02
and then you show up after a year and I say yeah you didn't do that great of a job woo what good is that

354
00:20:33.74 --> 00:20:39.50
the barn are the there were started got stolen I have found that unacceptable performance

355
00:20:39.50 --> 00:20:44.86
and the resultant bad efficiency reports can often be reduced to a minimum through early

356
00:20:44.86 --> 00:20:53.26
effective observation and counseling G what a novel idea when Dave starts screwing up don't wait

357
00:20:53.26 --> 00:20:57.98
six months to give the efficiency report say hey Dave it's been three weeks you've been on this

358
00:20:57.98 --> 00:21:04.86
project I already see that you're heading the wrong direction let's talk if a commander makes it a

359
00:21:04.86 --> 00:21:11.66
practice to observe his men closely and call them in periodically for an evaluation of their

360
00:21:11.66 --> 00:21:16.38
performance in terms of strengths and weaknesses he can often correct deficiencies without it

361
00:21:16.38 --> 00:21:26.38
becoming necessary to issue an unsatisfactory efficiency report boom it's a tool that you've got

362
00:21:26.38 --> 00:21:36.14
that you can use a three part program of and here's the three parts observation and evaluation

363
00:21:36.14 --> 00:21:41.42
counseling and guidance of the individual and individual and then further observation to determine

364
00:21:41.42 --> 00:21:46.86
the response to the counseling is your key to effective use of the efficiency report then it

365
00:21:46.86 --> 00:21:54.94
becomes a tool for improvement rather than merely a reward or punishment for past performance wow

366
00:21:56.14 --> 00:22:01.90
wow imagine that and it's unsap because in the navy you get an evaluation or a fitness report

367
00:22:01.90 --> 00:22:07.74
once a year and there's a lot of companies that we work with that do something similar there's

368
00:22:08.78 --> 00:22:14.38
that's just not often it's not often enough it's not even close and those periodic

369
00:22:15.82 --> 00:22:20.46
evaluations they actually don't even need to be that formal it's really just the core of building

370
00:22:20.46 --> 00:22:24.86
relationships is getting to know your people by being out with them the best thing you can do is

371
00:22:24.86 --> 00:22:29.34
know your people well enough to be able to recognize when they're going in the wrong direction

372
00:22:29.34 --> 00:22:33.02
and if you talk to your people once a year you're not going to know that because you don't even know

373
00:22:33.02 --> 00:22:37.90
what their typically like and so if I'm working with you and and I know Jaco pretty well and all

374
00:22:37.90 --> 00:22:42.62
of a sudden Jaco shows up one day and he's not Jaco I can get involved right then but the only way

375
00:22:42.62 --> 00:22:48.06
for me to tell that you're not yourself or not doing the things that I'm used to is I got to be

376
00:22:48.06 --> 00:22:51.66
around you just a little bit more and you don't need to track all this stuff every single time you don't

377
00:22:51.66 --> 00:22:57.10
need to know the formal piece of it and formal counseling is important but the best tool you've

378
00:22:57.10 --> 00:23:01.82
got is actually know them well enough to go something's not right and if you can intercept that

379
00:23:01.82 --> 00:23:08.94
on day one rather than day 30 or 60 or 90 not only do you actually help solve that problem that

380
00:23:08.94 --> 00:23:14.62
other person recognizes that you know and care about them enough to get involved and being able to

381
00:23:14.62 --> 00:23:19.18
do that is really a function of your time more than anything else of being around your people to

382
00:23:19.18 --> 00:23:24.62
know them well enough to identify that when they're off the path so it comes down as high

383
00:23:24.62 --> 00:23:31.18
management when I talk about planning and I say okay if I give Dave a mission tasking and say okay

384
00:23:31.18 --> 00:23:37.26
Dave come up with a plan and how you want to do this if I leave for 12 hours and you were 3

385
00:23:37.26 --> 00:23:40.86
degrees off and you're what you thought you should do versus what I thought you should do I come

386
00:23:40.86 --> 00:23:44.94
back 12 hours there's 12 hours of wasted time because you've been going on on the wrong direction

387
00:23:44.94 --> 00:23:49.50
and now you're way off course if I go hey Dave here's the here's the mission you need to

388
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:53.98
execute here's the task come up with your you know some connoffs I'll be back in a half an hour

389
00:23:54.70 --> 00:24:00.06
your 3 degrees off it oh I barely even takes a nudge to get you right back on track and we're we're

390
00:24:00.06 --> 00:24:09.18
tracking so the earlier you give people corrective measures the the the minimum the the the limit

391
00:24:09.18 --> 00:24:14.86
of what you have to do to get them back on course is is totally limited it's the minimum

392
00:24:14.86 --> 00:24:21.50
workforce required so if you and I if I said hey Dave here's a mission tasking come up with how

393
00:24:21.50 --> 00:24:25.98
you want to do I'll be back in half an hour when I came back in a half an hour and you're 3 degrees

394
00:24:25.98 --> 00:24:31.58
off course I barely I probably would be able to get you back on course by asking you will

395
00:24:31.58 --> 00:24:35.66
not even tell me anything just by saying hey what do you think about what do you think about

396
00:24:35.66 --> 00:24:38.62
this area up to the north do you think that's a you think there could be enemy up there

397
00:24:39.50 --> 00:24:42.78
that's kind of what the intel says right and you say yeah and I'd say oh

398
00:24:42.78 --> 00:24:47.34
are you gonna put a blocking force up there you didn't have a blocking force in your plan

399
00:24:47.34 --> 00:24:52.62
you go yes absolutely and cool now we're totally square yeah if I walk away for 12 hours

400
00:24:52.62 --> 00:24:57.42
and let you come up with a plan you're wide open to the enemy attack from the north you have

401
00:24:57.42 --> 00:25:01.82
you use your blocking force in a totally different area you don't even have enough people now

402
00:25:01.82 --> 00:25:06.14
because you so it's just it's totally wrong and now we got to come in with blunt force trauma

403
00:25:06.14 --> 00:25:09.82
and now it's not your planning anymore you've given up on a ship it's just it's just a nightmare

404
00:25:09.82 --> 00:25:15.10
it's crazy so the earlier I get involved the less force I have to use and my goal is the

405
00:25:15.10 --> 00:25:19.74
leaders to use the minimum force required and the longer I wait to use force but worse it's

406
00:25:19.74 --> 00:25:27.34
gonna be and if you're out there thinking about the time the the daunting task of spending

407
00:25:27.34 --> 00:25:34.54
all that time up front the ROI on your investment of time of front is is it's it's unlimited

408
00:25:34.54 --> 00:25:40.22
because if you make that investment up front which seems like a lot of time what you save on the back

409
00:25:40.22 --> 00:25:45.82
end of that so from the time manager standpoint yes yes it is an additional investment of a

410
00:25:45.82 --> 00:25:49.50
little bit of time upfront it is and you got to account for that time that is not free time

411
00:25:49.50 --> 00:25:56.38
but what you save from that ROI all day all day it's not even close and you know what is funny

412
00:25:56.38 --> 00:26:00.54
is you you're I disagree with you because you say it's this big investment up front it's not

413
00:26:00.54 --> 00:26:04.46
so low investment up front it's me going hey Dave how are you gonna execute this and you go

414
00:26:04.46 --> 00:26:07.26
all my do it like this and I go oh don't forget there's enemy up there you are I'm gonna put

415
00:26:07.26 --> 00:26:11.90
a blocking for sure okay cool there we go that's how that was it that took 18s that's the story we tell

416
00:26:11.90 --> 00:26:16.06
ourselves like hey I can't come back in 30 minutes because you actually can't you're absolutely right

417
00:26:16.06 --> 00:26:21.82
and it's the idea of whatever it seems like I don't have time a you do have time and if you do

418
00:26:21.82 --> 00:26:27.34
need to do some mental calculation of that time the ROI in that time is well worth whatever

419
00:26:27.34 --> 00:26:33.90
you might miss for that five minute check-in that happens up front and it also shows another person oh

420
00:26:33.90 --> 00:26:38.46
joccal care joccal is in the game joccal is paying attention I wonder if that means I'm gonna be more

421
00:26:38.46 --> 00:26:43.02
or less interested in giving you a really good plan if I know you care about it you know it's

422
00:26:43.02 --> 00:26:53.82
interesting too ROI the ROI on time is that it doesn't even make sense and I'll tell you why

423
00:26:53.82 --> 00:26:58.86
because I don't get that time back if you're supposed to execute a mission tonight and I give you

424
00:26:58.86 --> 00:27:04.94
12 hours to plan and I go hey here's the mission you got to execute and I don't come back and check in

425
00:27:04.94 --> 00:27:10.14
by the time 12 hours go by and I realize that your plan is a total disaster it's not that the ROI

426
00:27:10.70 --> 00:27:16.70
it's not I don't get return on my investment it's that we it's that it's it's bankrupt so it's total failure

427
00:27:17.34 --> 00:27:22.94
it's total in complete failure I can't even get it back the ROI is negative it's it's horrible

428
00:27:22.94 --> 00:27:30.38
where as a little investment upfront total gain changer totally now here's another section I wasn't

429
00:27:30.38 --> 00:27:36.22
gonna read and I remember I I sent you a picture of this book or sections of the book and you you said

430
00:27:36.22 --> 00:27:40.54
just read the whole just you're gonna just cover the whole thing yeah and I was kind of like yeah you

431
00:27:40.54 --> 00:27:44.86
know that's cool I'm sure I'll cover a lot of it but you know I'm always I don't want to waste people's

432
00:27:44.86 --> 00:27:48.78
time so I'm looking for okay what can we streamline a little bit so there's this section called

433
00:27:48.78 --> 00:27:53.66
promotion then look if you're in the civilian world how much do you care about how they advance

434
00:27:53.66 --> 00:28:00.54
people in the army in 1952 right whatever and then I read it a little bit okay well looks like we're

435
00:28:00.54 --> 00:28:05.02
covering this too and I'll tell you how it a second so it says promotion the promotion policy of a

436
00:28:05.02 --> 00:28:10.94
commanders of a command has a strong bearing on morale and overall efficiency it must be fair

437
00:28:11.74 --> 00:28:16.30
and by the way this is one thing that you're gonna start to pick up in this section of the book

438
00:28:16.30 --> 00:28:23.82
and in some of the other sections there is absolutely part of general clerk that is looking to get promoted

439
00:28:24.70 --> 00:28:29.26
and he you can feel it and there's gonna be other places where you feel it and what's cool is

440
00:28:29.98 --> 00:28:37.10
you'll feel it and he'll say it and then a little later on he'll he'll hint that you know what that

441
00:28:37.10 --> 00:28:41.02
doesn't really even matter so we're gonna go back and forth we're gonna come up with some of these

442
00:28:41.02 --> 00:28:48.94
things where you say okay he's a he's a guy that really cares that's in the game just to get promoted

443
00:28:48.94 --> 00:28:55.66
right which I am not a big proponent of hey your main reason to be in the game is get promoted that being said

444
00:28:56.70 --> 00:29:03.18
if I have got a team and I want to take care of my team well how do I how do I do the best job

445
00:29:03.18 --> 00:29:07.98
take my care of my team I get promoted so I have more leverage and more power and I can be positive

446
00:29:07.98 --> 00:29:13.26
influence on even more people so getting promoted if you're getting promoted for yourself

447
00:29:14.14 --> 00:29:20.06
we don't like that and by the way when I say we I'm talking about the people that work for you

448
00:29:20.06 --> 00:29:25.58
if you're getting promoted for yourself they don't like it we don't like that but if you're

449
00:29:25.58 --> 00:29:31.42
getting promoted so that you can help the team achieve their mission protect the team take care of

450
00:29:31.42 --> 00:29:37.26
the team grow the team influence the team in a positive way if that's why you're getting promoted

451
00:29:37.26 --> 00:29:44.54
cool good on you good we we like that you're doing it for the right reasons and if you think if you

452
00:29:44.54 --> 00:29:49.34
think if you think you can sneak around and get promoted for yourself but you don't really be

453
00:29:49.34 --> 00:29:58.22
to I promise in you I promise you everybody sees it so promotion it must be fair

454
00:29:58.86 --> 00:30:03.82
buy it the commander can encourage men to develop themselves for permissions for positions of

455
00:30:03.82 --> 00:30:10.22
supervision and leadership the commander should consider the following qualifications and attributes

456
00:30:10.22 --> 00:30:15.42
when considering a man for promotion so he goes into a list and what I did and what I wrote down here

457
00:30:15.42 --> 00:30:25.02
was when I go through this list aim the aim this list at yourself you aim this list at yourself

458
00:30:25.02 --> 00:30:44.46
are you promoteable number one reliability number one reliability when when I talk about relationships

459
00:30:44.46 --> 00:30:52.30
I use the word relationships I'm really talking about trust and trust if you don't have trust

460
00:30:52.30 --> 00:30:59.66
inside of a team all those lost well yeah so the question is how do you build trust well let me

461
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:05.90
give you a good hint the number one clue right here be reliable be reliable okay so that's number one

462
00:31:05.90 --> 00:31:12.14
number two his knowledge of his present job and his preparation for the next higher one so be

463
00:31:12.14 --> 00:31:17.90
knowledgeable proficiency text test scores leadership can he direct men

464
00:31:17.90 --> 00:31:25.66
ability to organize and manage a job okay these are all things if you aim these things at

465
00:31:25.66 --> 00:31:34.78
yourself it is a powerful thing to think about knowledge to detect and courage to correct errors

466
00:31:34.78 --> 00:31:43.66
in subordinates initiative does he perform well without close supervision appearance military

467
00:31:43.66 --> 00:31:49.42
courtesy and neatness this makes me happy that I wrote the warrior kid books

468
00:31:52.30 --> 00:31:57.82
maintenance of equipment individual and organizational attitude loyalty enthusiasm

469
00:31:57.82 --> 00:32:04.54
ability as an instructor ability as an instructor and I'll tell you what I've been thinking

470
00:32:04.54 --> 00:32:09.98
about and there's a couple of the things that we'll clue in on this we've been talking we've been

471
00:32:09.98 --> 00:32:17.26
developing leadership certification program at echelom front and one of the things that we've been

472
00:32:17.26 --> 00:32:26.86
dancing around is the fact that there's there's maybe well we we were dancing around with like

473
00:32:26.86 --> 00:32:30.78
two different pipelines like you're either a trainer that's going to train people how to lead

474
00:32:30.78 --> 00:32:34.14
or your leader and you're in a supervisor position and your management position and your leader

475
00:32:34.14 --> 00:32:40.86
and then we've kind of got into a point where we say listen these are the same thing and in

476
00:32:40.86 --> 00:32:47.34
order to become a good leader you have to be able to teach you have to be able to show people how to

477
00:32:47.34 --> 00:32:54.54
do things so it's interesting that he's got ability as an instructor because listen if I'm going

478
00:32:54.54 --> 00:32:59.42
to promote you Dave from you know from being in charge of a squad to being in charge of a tune

479
00:32:59.42 --> 00:33:04.78
I want you to be able to teach I want you to be able to instruct that is absolutely important

480
00:33:04.78 --> 00:33:09.26
and and in a leadership environment i want you to be able to teach the team about leadership.

481
00:33:09.26 --> 00:33:13.66
I want you to be able to teach when I put you in charge of a tune I want you to be able to teach

482
00:33:13.66 --> 00:33:19.02
your squad leaders how to lead. I want you to be able to teach your fire team leaders how to lead

483
00:33:19.02 --> 00:33:24.86
and I also want you to be able to teach them how to break down a 240g. I want you to be able

484
00:33:24.86 --> 00:33:29.34
to teach us gesagt so the ability to be an instructor is important and it's equally important

485
00:33:29.34 --> 00:33:32.08
because when we teach, we learn.

486
00:33:32.08 --> 00:33:33.92
Yeah.

487
00:33:33.92 --> 00:33:39.38
That second point was what I was thinking in my head a lot is, you know, top gun for

488
00:33:39.38 --> 00:33:42.48
my community is kind of the apex of instruction.

489
00:33:42.48 --> 00:33:48.12
You know, the quality of instruction is is kind of at its peak there because you

490
00:33:48.12 --> 00:33:49.40
get to focus just on that.

491
00:33:49.40 --> 00:33:52.20
You don't have all these other distractions going on so you focus on that.

492
00:33:52.20 --> 00:33:55.80
I learned more there than I did anywhere else.

493
00:33:55.80 --> 00:34:02.000
And the ability to teach is really comes from how much you truly understand something.

494
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.20
And for me, being able to fly an airplane or run the radar or manage the systems, a lot

495
00:34:07.20 --> 00:34:09.04
of people can do that.

496
00:34:09.04 --> 00:34:15.60
But when you try to teach something, it exposes your gaps in knowledge.

497
00:34:15.60 --> 00:34:19.56
And a good teacher, when they break down what they're going to teach, they recognize,

498
00:34:19.56 --> 00:34:22.28
oh, I don't actually understand this very well.

499
00:34:22.28 --> 00:34:25.76
So before I teach it to you, I get to go learn about this more.

500
00:34:25.76 --> 00:34:31.24
So the learning connected to the teaching, I learned more because my obligation was to teach

501
00:34:31.24 --> 00:34:32.24
it.

502
00:34:32.24 --> 00:34:35.36
And as I'm learning to teach, expose all the things I didn't know.

503
00:34:35.36 --> 00:34:39.40
So a good teacher actually has to understand it better than anybody else.

504
00:34:39.40 --> 00:34:41.92
And that connection between those two is so critical.

505
00:34:41.92 --> 00:34:47.24
And the idea of teaching is I think a reflection or anything of how well you truly know

506
00:34:47.24 --> 00:34:48.24
something.

507
00:34:48.24 --> 00:34:51.12
And you don't really test yourself and how well you know it until you have to explain

508
00:34:51.12 --> 00:34:52.68
it to somebody else.

509
00:34:52.68 --> 00:34:53.68
Yeah.

510
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:58.60
So I started, I just wrote down, you know, I hope he's about to say that as you teach

511
00:34:58.60 --> 00:34:59.60
you learn.

512
00:34:59.60 --> 00:35:01.60
And that's exactly what you said.

513
00:35:01.60 --> 00:35:05.60
You identify the gaps in your own knowledge and you go, okay, better figure this out.

514
00:35:05.60 --> 00:35:06.60
A better go run the stroke.

515
00:35:06.60 --> 00:35:10.20
I better pull the thread on that until I understand it better.

516
00:35:10.20 --> 00:35:15.04
Next participation in unit and community activities does he use his time off to improve

517
00:35:15.04 --> 00:35:18.68
himself.

518
00:35:18.68 --> 00:35:21.68
Aim that one at yourself.

519
00:35:21.68 --> 00:35:25.68
Is he a good soldier all the time?

520
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:31.04
Is the job he has charged with being done better now than it was when he took over?

521
00:35:31.04 --> 00:35:38.16
Judgment in common sense, a good scale of values, ability to receive and carry out instructions

522
00:35:38.16 --> 00:35:44.24
has he been efficiently filling his grade position, accident record, incident record,

523
00:35:44.24 --> 00:35:49.20
a wall in article 15, which means it has the dude gotten in trouble before.

524
00:35:49.20 --> 00:35:52.20
Really powerful list, there may be other considerations.

525
00:35:52.20 --> 00:35:57.24
They should add up to confidence that the man will play as part well under any conditions

526
00:35:57.24 --> 00:36:04.000
especially in unusual situations.

527
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.32
What's interesting about that?

528
00:36:05.32 --> 00:36:12.16
Why does that make me think awesome thoughts?

529
00:36:12.16 --> 00:36:18.16
Because what that says is that this military guy who believes in discipline and believes

530
00:36:18.16 --> 00:36:23.96
in being able to do your job and being able to receive and carry out instructions, that's

531
00:36:23.96 --> 00:36:25.44
what he said.

532
00:36:25.44 --> 00:36:30.88
He wants you to be especially able to perform in unusual situations.

533
00:36:30.88 --> 00:36:35.68
How do you get good at performing on unusual situations?

534
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:42.32
You get tested, you get tasked, you get things thrown at you and you have to use your mind.

535
00:36:42.32 --> 00:36:45.60
It's great that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.

536
00:36:45.60 --> 00:36:46.60
This is my point.

537
00:36:46.60 --> 00:36:50.04
Think that you have the ability to receive and carry out instructions.

538
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:51.88
That's great.

539
00:36:51.88 --> 00:36:55.48
But if I throw something in usual at you and what you have to do is figure it out and you

540
00:36:55.48 --> 00:37:01.32
don't know how to do that, we got it all proble.

541
00:37:01.32 --> 00:37:05.44
Unless you want him as a member of your team do not promote him or recommend him for

542
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:06.44
promotion.

543
00:37:06.44 --> 00:37:12.52
The promotion policy of a unit commander should be published and understood by all.

544
00:37:12.52 --> 00:37:17.60
Then it goes through this next section, elimination of ineffective personnel.

545
00:37:17.60 --> 00:37:21.96
Like automatorship, when the higher one the fire, when a mentor will wind the fire.

546
00:37:21.96 --> 00:37:27.08
It is the commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States

547
00:37:27.08 --> 00:37:28.88
Army.

548
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:31.28
What a beast statement that is.

549
00:37:31.28 --> 00:37:36.04
It is that commander's duty to contribute to raising the standards of the United States

550
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:38.08
Army.

551
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:43.16
I want to approach this goal is a continuous evaluation of his personnel.

552
00:37:43.16 --> 00:37:46.12
Officers, non-commission officers and enlisted men like.

553
00:37:46.12 --> 00:37:52.64
When ineptness is revealed or continuing ineffectiveness is detected in officers and non-commission

554
00:37:52.64 --> 00:38:00.08
officers, it is the commander's duty to see that corrective measures are taken elimination

555
00:38:00.08 --> 00:38:04.44
or reduction in grade as appropriate.

556
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:09.000
So you have done your escalation of counseling, I have done everything I can to achieve

557
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.72
if I can straighten Dave Burke out, he can't make it happen.

558
00:38:12.72 --> 00:38:18.16
Dave Burke needs to go bye-bye.

559
00:38:18.16 --> 00:38:23.44
The importance of a good but fair reduction policy is often overlooked.

560
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:28.88
Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.

561
00:38:28.88 --> 00:38:33.08
G.

562
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:34.88
That comes as a big shock.

563
00:38:34.88 --> 00:38:37.92
Few things disrupt the unit more than the presence of inefficient leaders.

564
00:38:37.92 --> 00:38:39.40
So let's think about this.

565
00:38:39.40 --> 00:38:43.96
If Dave's working for me and Dave is inefficient and Dave doesn't do a good job and Dave

566
00:38:43.96 --> 00:38:49.80
drops the ball and Dave's working for me and I continue to allow Dave to be there.

567
00:38:49.80 --> 00:38:50.80
What does the team think of him?

568
00:38:50.80 --> 00:38:52.64
What does it say about you as a leader?

569
00:38:52.64 --> 00:38:55.40
It says I suck as a leader.

570
00:38:55.40 --> 00:38:56.60
That's what it says.

571
00:38:56.60 --> 00:39:01.72
Or it says that you don't actually care because this leader this day that's underperforming,

572
00:39:01.72 --> 00:39:03.000
who is he actually affecting?

573
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.24
He's affecting the whole team and you know, a synonym for that reduction rank is that's

574
00:39:09.24 --> 00:39:11.16
rank is essentially responsibility.

575
00:39:11.16 --> 00:39:14.000
So as your rank grows in the military, you know, responsibility grows.

576
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.96
So you don't have to have a ranking structure in your organization.

577
00:39:16.96 --> 00:39:21.36
You've got responsibility for, you know, this guy is a team leader or supervisor or impact

578
00:39:21.36 --> 00:39:22.36
the team.

579
00:39:22.36 --> 00:39:24.44
This guy's underperformance that you tolerate.

580
00:39:24.44 --> 00:39:25.88
Doesn't just affect this underperformance.

581
00:39:25.88 --> 00:39:30.24
It's all the people in his influence and they're looking at you saying this is what

582
00:39:30.24 --> 00:39:33.84
Jocca was going to put up with this is the bar that he's going to tolerate and he'll

583
00:39:33.84 --> 00:39:39.92
by the way, this affects me personally and just like on the other extreme of getting rid

584
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:44.52
of people way too soon, way too premature that you haven't invested in, keeping the wrong

585
00:39:44.52 --> 00:39:54.96
people around in terms of what that does to your leadership capital.

586
00:39:54.96 --> 00:39:58.96
Regulations provide for the reduction of enlisted men and the separation of officers

587
00:39:58.96 --> 00:40:04.000
for an inefficiency and actual performance of their job or as a result of misconduct.

588
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.28
The latter is where where we fall most often.

589
00:40:08.28 --> 00:40:11.44
We fail, or sorry, the latter is where we fail most often.

590
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:17.92
We fail because we do not face up to the fact that key personnel to be good leaders of

591
00:40:17.92 --> 00:40:23.36
young men must also have good character.

592
00:40:23.36 --> 00:40:29.68
More character will inevitably manifest itself in poor conduct, leaders influence the actions

593
00:40:29.68 --> 00:40:31.80
of their subordinates.

594
00:40:31.80 --> 00:40:37.12
Most leaders are considered by those of less rank as highly qualified and competent.

595
00:40:37.12 --> 00:40:42.20
Therefore, when poor conduct is manifested off duty by anyone in leadership capacity, it

596
00:40:42.20 --> 00:40:46.08
has a detrimental effect on the entire unit.

597
00:40:46.08 --> 00:40:51.76
Especially dangerous in this regard are those key personnel who are outstanding in their

598
00:40:51.76 --> 00:40:53.16
work.

599
00:40:53.16 --> 00:40:59.16
Or their influence is even greater on troops who, observing them, will often emulate their

600
00:40:59.16 --> 00:41:02.68
actions even to the point of delinquency.

601
00:41:02.68 --> 00:41:07.52
If this condition persists, it can lead to a broken breakdown of discipline throughout

602
00:41:07.52 --> 00:41:10.92
the unit in an incredibly short time.

603
00:41:10.92 --> 00:41:16.92
Leaders with character deficiencies, regardless of how good they might appear in field training,

604
00:41:16.92 --> 00:41:23.12
or a luxury we cannot afford.

605
00:41:23.12 --> 00:41:24.12
Would you write down?

606
00:41:24.12 --> 00:41:30.04
I wrote down character and conduct.

607
00:41:30.04 --> 00:41:36.20
I was thinking as you are reading this, you cannot, and I learned this in the Marine Corps.

608
00:41:36.20 --> 00:41:40.88
You cannot separate your work life from some other part of your life.

609
00:41:40.88 --> 00:41:46.12
If you were a leader, you are committed to being a leader all the time.

610
00:41:46.12 --> 00:41:53.60
Where you are scrutinized, the most risk is how you act off the clock, if you want to call

611
00:41:53.60 --> 00:41:54.60
that.

612
00:41:54.60 --> 00:41:58.68
I can stand up in front of my Marines and tell them all the things I expect from them.

613
00:41:58.68 --> 00:42:01.44
Whatever those might be, I can make a list that are all good and I could behave like that

614
00:42:01.44 --> 00:42:02.44
at work.

615
00:42:02.44 --> 00:42:07.52
If I go out and down or back in my personal life, anywhere else outside of work, and I reveal

616
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:10.16
that I don't live by the expectations I set for my people.

617
00:42:10.16 --> 00:42:14.92
My character is revealed that I don't actually apply those to myself.

618
00:42:14.92 --> 00:42:19.48
The degree to which that undermines me as a leader at work is actually much worse than

619
00:42:19.48 --> 00:42:23.32
if I just wasn't great at work and I'm just working on it and trying to get better.

620
00:42:23.32 --> 00:42:30.12
Your character, your character, sooner or later, is going to be revealed.

621
00:42:30.12 --> 00:42:32.60
Because you're going to find yourself in a place where you think nobody is looking,

622
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:36.52
you're going to find yourself in an environment where you think it's okay and who you are

623
00:42:36.52 --> 00:42:38.44
is going to come out.

624
00:42:38.44 --> 00:42:43.96
He said, I wish I wrote an exact what his character will be connected to your conduct.

625
00:42:43.96 --> 00:42:49.000
Who you really are eventually is going to influence how you behave?

626
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.68
If your plan is to put on a good front at work, you're going to get found out and the damage

627
00:42:54.68 --> 00:43:00.36
to that your credibility and the damage to the team, if that's, that you just simply cannot

628
00:43:00.36 --> 00:43:05.16
separate who you are as a leader and have a period of time or a place where you don't have

629
00:43:05.16 --> 00:43:07.68
to hold yourself to that same standard.

630
00:43:07.68 --> 00:43:13.72
That's what I wrote down when you were talking was, hey, you can try and put up

631
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:16.68
that front, you already said, well, you try and put up that front.

632
00:43:16.68 --> 00:43:21.88
If you and your mind and your little tiny brain, because it is tiny, if this is what you think

633
00:43:21.88 --> 00:43:23.08
you have a small brain.

634
00:43:23.08 --> 00:43:26.84
If in your brain, your tiny little brain you think it doesn't really matter no one will

635
00:43:26.84 --> 00:43:33.08
notice your brain is small and you are stupid because everybody sees that, everybody.

636
00:43:33.08 --> 00:43:37.000
And everybody is watching you all the time.

637
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
They're watching you.

638
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.20
They see you all the time.

639
00:43:42.20 --> 00:43:44.20
Easy.

640
00:43:44.20 --> 00:43:48.36
While the commander should place heavy emphasis on re-enlistment and do all in his power

641
00:43:48.36 --> 00:43:52.60
to retain effective personnel, he should bear in mind that the army wants quality not

642
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:56.48
quantity, make your program selective.

643
00:43:56.48 --> 00:43:59.76
Social life, every army post should be close, net, happy family.

644
00:43:59.76 --> 00:44:05.56
Commanders can foster this by ensuring that families of their men have adequate social life.

645
00:44:05.56 --> 00:44:09.84
A particular importance is the inclusion of youth activities designed, especially for youth

646
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:13.52
and not for adults, good programs in this field will not just happen, they will require

647
00:44:13.52 --> 00:44:18.20
your best people.

648
00:44:18.20 --> 00:44:24.52
You know when you start looking at building what you just said, you know, how do you expect

649
00:44:24.52 --> 00:44:30.80
the people to act if you haven't given them a good support structure with their family?

650
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:32.28
Just doesn't work.

651
00:44:32.28 --> 00:44:35.60
It is essential that all recommendations he talks about this non-commissioned officers

652
00:44:35.60 --> 00:44:39.52
advisory council, which is, hey, you've got to, you've got to, you can, you can

653
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:45.92
have a symbol groups of your workers, of your team, of your employees, the leaders, the

654
00:44:45.92 --> 00:44:51.60
frontline troops, you can assemble groups of them and get feedback from them.

655
00:44:51.60 --> 00:44:54.80
And he says it's essential that all recommendations receive the attention of the major

656
00:44:54.80 --> 00:44:59.28
commander concerned for failure to act on justified recommendations will defeat the whole

657
00:44:59.28 --> 00:45:04.52
purpose of having these councils.

658
00:45:04.52 --> 00:45:08.76
And you know, it's interesting we've been doing some work at echelon front with some of these

659
00:45:08.76 --> 00:45:15.28
councils, which is always cool because now you're getting people from different, different

660
00:45:15.28 --> 00:45:19.72
cross sections of the company that are sort of these councils and that's been interesting.

661
00:45:19.72 --> 00:45:20.72
It's been very interesting.

662
00:45:20.72 --> 00:45:26.48
And it's kind of what we do anyways when we go into a company, we, you know, we get

663
00:45:26.48 --> 00:45:29.88
a cross section, but it's nice when the companies already have a cross section that we are

664
00:45:29.88 --> 00:45:30.88
talking to.

665
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:35.08
So, if you're running a company right now or if you're in a company right now, it's

666
00:45:35.08 --> 00:45:39.52
a good idea to think about putting together some kind of a council where you say, hey,

667
00:45:39.52 --> 00:45:44.76
we need to take the best ideas, take the best practices, take the grievances that we have,

668
00:45:44.76 --> 00:45:48.32
assemble them together in a logical way to push them up the chain of command because if the,

669
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:52.92
if the boss, you know, has us work and laid every Friday and the boss doesn't know how much

670
00:45:52.92 --> 00:45:57.64
that negatively impacts us, how can we expect them to change it?

671
00:45:57.64 --> 00:46:00.84
Answer, we cannot get together.

672
00:46:00.84 --> 00:46:09.48
Put forth information in a consolidated effort so that the boss knows what's happening.

673
00:46:09.48 --> 00:46:15.44
And if you're the boss and you get that feedback, implement as best you can act on it.

674
00:46:15.44 --> 00:46:16.44
Yeah.

675
00:46:16.44 --> 00:46:20.08
Direction staffs, the staff is no more than an extension of the commander's abilities and

676
00:46:20.08 --> 00:46:23.12
a good commander must be able to handle the staff property.

677
00:46:23.12 --> 00:46:27.76
Officers of a staff should carry out the commander's policies enthusiastically by the same

678
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:29.56
token.

679
00:46:29.56 --> 00:46:34.40
They should bring to the attention of the commander, those matters deserving his personal

680
00:46:34.40 --> 00:46:38.04
attention.

681
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:47.24
Staff visits to make sound decisions the commander must receive timely and reliable reports from

682
00:46:47.24 --> 00:46:53.72
his staff, which means that his staff must visit unit activities.

683
00:46:53.72 --> 00:47:01.16
So talk to us, Dave, about what they're talking about when they say staff.

684
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:09.12
So like when I was a commander of a unit, my staff, I had, I had subordinate leaders that

685
00:47:09.12 --> 00:47:11.60
were responsible for different elements.

686
00:47:11.60 --> 00:47:14.20
So I'd have like an operation staff that ran the operations.

687
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:17.64
I have a maintenance staff that ran the maintenance and logistics and supply and all the

688
00:47:17.64 --> 00:47:18.64
different components.

689
00:47:18.64 --> 00:47:23.000
And I would underneath these leaders, which were really staff officers kind of building the

690
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.04
plans were a whole bunch of people implementing their processes or their SOPs or whatever

691
00:47:28.04 --> 00:47:29.44
they created.

692
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:33.92
If you got a staff officer, someone working for you that has a plan and has their team implementing

693
00:47:33.92 --> 00:47:36.84
the plan out in the field or out on the flight line.

694
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:41.32
And they don't go out there to see how effective it is, what the real barriers are, what

695
00:47:41.32 --> 00:47:45.96
the problems are, and they are sort of operating in that vacuum of their staff position

696
00:47:45.96 --> 00:47:48.12
or in their cubicle their office.

697
00:47:48.12 --> 00:47:49.44
And they're out out there with those people.

698
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:54.20
They have no sense of the real feedback of the problems and the challenges that people

699
00:47:54.20 --> 00:47:57.56
facing while they're implementing their plans.

700
00:47:57.56 --> 00:48:01.92
And so it comes, I think it's as simple as what you described.

701
00:48:01.92 --> 00:48:05.28
I think you said it like in the first pages, leave your office and go out and spend time

702
00:48:05.28 --> 00:48:07.32
with your people to see what's really going on down there.

703
00:48:07.32 --> 00:48:10.60
But what if seven years ago I had that job and I kind of remember what it was like back

704
00:48:10.60 --> 00:48:11.60
then?

705
00:48:11.60 --> 00:48:12.60
Is that good?

706
00:48:12.60 --> 00:48:14.60
Is that a cover of me?

707
00:48:14.60 --> 00:48:16.60
No.

708
00:48:16.60 --> 00:48:23.96
The, it also is just the connection to having your people see that you're willing to go out

709
00:48:23.96 --> 00:48:25.76
there and just spend time with them.

710
00:48:25.76 --> 00:48:28.48
The benefit of spending time with your people.

711
00:48:28.48 --> 00:48:32.12
On one sense it's actually really important and we can talk about all the different things

712
00:48:32.12 --> 00:48:34.72
that I would learn when I just spent time with my people.

713
00:48:34.72 --> 00:48:35.72
I learned about things.

714
00:48:35.72 --> 00:48:36.72
I learned how things worked.

715
00:48:36.72 --> 00:48:38.64
I learned the challenges they had.

716
00:48:38.64 --> 00:48:42.24
But there is a matter, there is some level of effort that it takes for you to get away

717
00:48:42.24 --> 00:48:45.64
from your desk as a leader to go spend time with your people.

718
00:48:45.64 --> 00:48:48.08
And most of the time your troops actually understand that.

719
00:48:48.08 --> 00:48:51.44
They know it's not as simple for the CEO to just get away.

720
00:48:51.44 --> 00:48:56.96
So when you do the power of, of you doing that on, is really significant.

721
00:48:56.96 --> 00:48:59.64
They recognize that you're making the effort to do it.

722
00:48:59.64 --> 00:49:03.000
If your plan is to do, we call these touch and go, I had to go out there and show your

723
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.48
face to the team.

724
00:49:04.48 --> 00:49:08.12
If that's your kind of like, hey, I'm going to show my face and you don't actually get

725
00:49:08.12 --> 00:49:10.20
out spend time with them, they're going to see that coming in my way.

726
00:49:10.20 --> 00:49:14.80
But if you just spend a little time, what you'll end up getting is a bunch of unfiltered

727
00:49:14.80 --> 00:49:18.20
feedback that didn't run through the chain and get chopped by all your staff, although

728
00:49:18.20 --> 00:49:19.60
we have to you, you get unfiltered.

729
00:49:19.60 --> 00:49:21.80
Get sterilized totally.

730
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:26.60
You know what, what you want more than anything, you want a 19 year old Lance Corporal

731
00:49:26.60 --> 00:49:32.04
who is turning a wrench on a jet to explain to you why this is hard.

732
00:49:32.04 --> 00:49:34.88
Now, of course, you want to use the chain to come in.

733
00:49:34.88 --> 00:49:36.16
I want that to run through the chain.

734
00:49:36.16 --> 00:49:38.84
I want to see that multiple ways.

735
00:49:38.84 --> 00:49:42.48
But if you want unfiltered feedback to which really going on with your team, you have to

736
00:49:42.48 --> 00:49:48.12
get down to spend time with your team.

737
00:49:48.12 --> 00:49:49.68
That being said, back to the book.

738
00:49:49.68 --> 00:49:54.88
It is essential, however, that a staff officer making such visits understands the thin

739
00:49:54.88 --> 00:50:01.20
line that divides staff supervision from metal some interference.

740
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:02.72
So there's the dichotomy of leadership.

741
00:50:02.72 --> 00:50:03.92
He'll be jumping the chain.

742
00:50:03.92 --> 00:50:08.04
He must realize that he is not a commander.

743
00:50:08.04 --> 00:50:12.88
He should avoid criticizing subordinate commanders and report and said they're shortcomings.

744
00:50:12.88 --> 00:50:18.08
Two is commander and should you see that his reports reflect favorably as well as unfavorable

745
00:50:18.08 --> 00:50:19.08
conditions.

746
00:50:19.08 --> 00:50:22.44
So you've got to make sure that you're not just being a rat going out there.

747
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:26.08
And you've got to make sure that you don't interfere.

748
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:28.08
It can cause interference.

749
00:50:28.08 --> 00:50:31.80
If Dave, you're having a meeting at S.L.M.

750
00:50:31.80 --> 00:50:37.000
front and you've got all the instructors because you want to cover some L-dap information

751
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.64
and you're doing a Zoom meeting and you're going to talk shop about a bunch of different

752
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:43.84
things and all of a sudden I just pop in there.

753
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:45.88
Well, you know, what am I doing in there?

754
00:50:45.88 --> 00:50:47.88
And you had a agenda and all of a sudden I'm in there.

755
00:50:47.88 --> 00:50:52.000
There's times where I'm just causing interference.

756
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.32
And that's really not what we're looking to do.

757
00:50:56.32 --> 00:50:59.16
Now all that being said, go ahead.

758
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:03.68
I was just going to say, especially as I got more senior when I was in charge of an entire

759
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:05.000
squadron.

760
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
My bias was actually towards trying to spend time.

761
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.16
And my bias was towards normalizing the review of me as a person.

762
00:51:13.16 --> 00:51:15.60
And let me just explain that for a minute.

763
00:51:15.60 --> 00:51:19.16
Every single person in the squadron knew who the squadron commander was.

764
00:51:19.16 --> 00:51:23.52
Everybody from the next the next in command to me, my number two guy, all the way down

765
00:51:23.52 --> 00:51:25.40
to the most my most junior marine.

766
00:51:25.40 --> 00:51:31.48
And if I did nothing, the natural state would be for them to put almost put me in

767
00:51:31.48 --> 00:51:32.48
a pedestal.

768
00:51:32.48 --> 00:51:35.84
Now they couldn't even relate to me as a person.

769
00:51:35.84 --> 00:51:39.12
Along with that, I really didn't have a lot of time.

770
00:51:39.12 --> 00:51:43.12
I was busy doing a lot of things, especially dealing with higher headquarters and other

771
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:44.12
components.

772
00:51:44.12 --> 00:51:45.92
So I didn't have all day every day.

773
00:51:45.92 --> 00:51:50.72
So the times that I was out there was rare because I'd simply had a lot going on.

774
00:51:50.72 --> 00:51:53.64
So my bias and I'm talking the needle a little bit off center.

775
00:51:53.64 --> 00:51:57.92
My bias was if I could spend a little more time and set up a little less time, if I could

776
00:51:57.92 --> 00:52:02.16
get a little more understanding what's going on, then a little less, that was my bias.

777
00:52:02.16 --> 00:52:09.64
Because the natural tendency for most people would almost put a commander on a pedestal.

778
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:11.88
It's not even a person.

779
00:52:11.88 --> 00:52:15.76
He's elevated to a status, it's almost unrelatable.

780
00:52:15.76 --> 00:52:19.44
And if I could create just a little bit of falling of, hey, I'm a normal person.

781
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:20.96
I really want to know what's going on in here.

782
00:52:20.96 --> 00:52:23.96
I really want to have some connection on what you're doing.

783
00:52:23.96 --> 00:52:24.96
I would bias towards that.

784
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:26.88
There were so many other forces at play.

785
00:52:26.88 --> 00:52:30.36
There was very little risk of me being the type of guy that I'm just hanging out, I hate

786
00:52:30.36 --> 00:52:31.36
what's going on down here.

787
00:52:31.36 --> 00:52:33.32
How's your boss and what?

788
00:52:33.32 --> 00:52:37.36
So the risk of there was lower, the other point, I think that point is totally valid.

789
00:52:37.36 --> 00:52:41.64
And the reason I'm making mention of this is that at least in the military, the chain

790
00:52:41.64 --> 00:52:44.08
of command is understood.

791
00:52:44.08 --> 00:52:49.24
And the barrier for me was that being so rigid that people didn't see me as a person who

792
00:52:49.24 --> 00:52:51.16
really want to know what's going on.

793
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:55.88
So I would bias in that direction as if I was splitting the difference when what I was

794
00:52:55.88 --> 00:52:59.80
going to do, I would try to spend more time than less.

795
00:52:59.80 --> 00:53:03.88
If you're not seen as a human being, you don't have connections with the troops, if you

796
00:53:03.88 --> 00:53:07.12
don't have connections with the troops, none of this, none of it, nothing that we're talking

797
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:10.96
about even matters, anyway, shape or form basically.

798
00:53:10.96 --> 00:53:16.72
Basically, you've got to be a person.

799
00:53:16.72 --> 00:53:21.72
The question of visitors, back to the book, a commander can expect many inspectors and visitors

800
00:53:21.72 --> 00:53:26.16
and it should be his policy to encourage and welcome visits and import from important

801
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:27.16
officials.

802
00:53:27.16 --> 00:53:32.12
This of course means that his house must be constantly kept in order.

803
00:53:32.12 --> 00:53:37.88
That is how it should be for the unit that is uniformly excellent in all things that

804
00:53:37.88 --> 00:53:42.88
all times is one that will be outstanding in battle.

805
00:53:42.88 --> 00:53:49.44
Look upon visitors not as interruptions or harassment, but as the chance to show the public

806
00:53:49.44 --> 00:53:52.16
just how really good your unit is.

807
00:53:52.16 --> 00:53:54.04
That's pretty epic, dude.

808
00:53:54.04 --> 00:53:55.68
That is so important.

809
00:53:55.68 --> 00:54:00.96
I keep coming back to my time as a squadron commander, because when I commanded a unit,

810
00:54:00.96 --> 00:54:04.48
it was the very first operational F-35 B squadron in the world.

811
00:54:04.48 --> 00:54:08.68
It was the focal point of all things marine aviation.

812
00:54:08.68 --> 00:54:15.60
It was a under emichor scope, and we had visitors all the time.

813
00:54:15.60 --> 00:54:21.48
Everything from US senators, four star generals, local congressmen, everybody wanted, there's

814
00:54:21.48 --> 00:54:24.64
a massive investment in time and they wanted to know what was going on.

815
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:29.12
There's a propensity towards when we get a note, hey, you're getting a notification, you're

816
00:54:29.12 --> 00:54:31.76
getting this delegation's coming to visit.

817
00:54:31.76 --> 00:54:35.44
They would focus their time on his preparing for that visit.

818
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:39.92
I wanted no time spent on preparation for the visit.

819
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:42.44
We're not going to clean the floors.

820
00:54:42.44 --> 00:54:43.72
We're going to operate as normal.

821
00:54:43.72 --> 00:54:47.92
I want them to come down and see, and if you are actually at that square to a unit, you

822
00:54:47.92 --> 00:54:50.12
don't need to prepare for those visits.

823
00:54:50.12 --> 00:54:53.40
If your plan is, oh, they're coming, hey, everybody started cleaning up.

824
00:54:53.40 --> 00:54:57.36
Shot in your boots and empty and trash cans and cleaning the tops of doors that you

825
00:54:57.36 --> 00:55:00.28
things you would not normally do.

826
00:55:00.28 --> 00:55:05.40
My view on visits was they can show up any place, any time, anywhere with no notice.

827
00:55:05.40 --> 00:55:06.40
I don't care.

828
00:55:06.40 --> 00:55:07.84
If I'm not there, no factor.

829
00:55:07.84 --> 00:55:08.84
Somebody will cover down.

830
00:55:08.84 --> 00:55:12.44
Staff Sergeant will cover down, Lieutenant, I don't care.

831
00:55:12.44 --> 00:55:14.44
The message that sent to the Marines was twofold.

832
00:55:14.44 --> 00:55:17.28
As one is hit the boss, doesn't freak out when people come to visit.

833
00:55:17.28 --> 00:55:18.28
It's no big deal.

834
00:55:18.28 --> 00:55:21.72
If we're actually a square to waste with, think we are, who cares?

835
00:55:21.72 --> 00:55:22.72
Show up, come check it out.

836
00:55:22.72 --> 00:55:25.92
You're going to see what you're going to see is the best squadron in the world.

837
00:55:25.92 --> 00:55:26.92
That's what you're going to see.

838
00:55:26.92 --> 00:55:27.92
So no factor.

839
00:55:27.92 --> 00:55:29.72
Visits are not a big deal.

840
00:55:29.72 --> 00:55:37.56
Check, unit athletic programs, athletic programs developed in conjunction with the physical

841
00:55:37.56 --> 00:55:38.56
fitness program.

842
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:41.000
We'll do much to enhance the physical stamina of unit.

843
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.16
Why do I cover this?

844
00:55:43.16 --> 00:55:45.24
Why do I, why don't I even cover this?

845
00:55:45.24 --> 00:55:47.68
Well, because it's true.

846
00:55:47.68 --> 00:55:52.68
Well, because if we're out there, so focused on leadership that we don't, we let our

847
00:55:52.68 --> 00:55:57.64
physical bodies fall apart, we're wrong.

848
00:55:57.64 --> 00:56:02.84
And he knows that an active, an active interest in athletics is provided by the commander

849
00:56:02.84 --> 00:56:06.24
through proper motivation and personal interest.

850
00:56:06.24 --> 00:56:11.40
A well-planned and integrated athletic program is an important part of any unit training

851
00:56:11.40 --> 00:56:12.40
program.

852
00:56:12.40 --> 00:56:19.24
It will take the minds of the men off what some of them consider as the monotony of training.

853
00:56:19.24 --> 00:56:24.28
We'll keep the command and better physical shape, help build a unit, a speed of core, help

854
00:56:24.28 --> 00:56:32.48
develop self-discipline and team spirit.

855
00:56:32.48 --> 00:56:34.68
Man, we get away from that.

856
00:56:34.68 --> 00:56:39.48
Emphasis in athletic programs should be on the small unit level, such as company battery

857
00:56:39.48 --> 00:56:42.04
troop rather than at higher levels.

858
00:56:42.04 --> 00:56:48.92
So look, I don't know what situation you're in in life or what your business is doing,

859
00:56:48.92 --> 00:56:55.80
but doing something physical together is very, very helpful.

860
00:56:55.80 --> 00:56:59.84
Anybody that's ever done an FTAx with echelon front, it was exactly what you're talking.

861
00:56:59.84 --> 00:57:01.40
Yeah, even come to the master.

862
00:57:01.40 --> 00:57:06.000
Come to the master and come do PT at the master and you're doing something that's hard,

863
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.36
but it's fun and we're having a good time.

864
00:57:09.36 --> 00:57:14.24
We're doing them, by the way, we're doing the master December 4th and 5th.

865
00:57:14.24 --> 00:57:17.60
No, December 3rd and 4th in Texas.

866
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:21.000
And we're still going to do PT, we're not quite figured out what we're doing instead

867
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.52
of due jutsu on the closing night, but we're going to figure something awesome out.

868
00:57:25.52 --> 00:57:27.16
But why?

869
00:57:27.16 --> 00:57:28.16
Why do we do that?

870
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:30.44
Because people feel better.

871
00:57:30.44 --> 00:57:34.72
It brings the, look, people that will have thousand people there, well, for the

872
00:57:34.72 --> 00:57:37.88
master in the next master, we want to have thousand people there.

873
00:57:37.88 --> 00:57:42.48
We'll probably have a third of that or maybe half that.

874
00:57:42.48 --> 00:57:44.48
But people from all over the country will get together.

875
00:57:44.48 --> 00:57:50.48
They've never met before and they will bond in 45 minutes of early morning PT.

876
00:57:50.48 --> 00:57:54.92
If you get up at five in the morning and PT, you'll be less tired than if you got up

877
00:57:54.92 --> 00:57:56.96
at seven in the morning and went straight to the conference room.

878
00:57:56.96 --> 00:57:58.20
You'll be less tired.

879
00:57:58.20 --> 00:58:01.84
Stopped at the donut factory.

880
00:58:01.84 --> 00:58:06.56
So he talks about attractive living areas, you know, providing people a good place to live.

881
00:58:06.56 --> 00:58:14.44
Well, that applies with applying, supplying people to good place to work.

882
00:58:14.44 --> 00:58:16.72
Maintenance and supply economy.

883
00:58:16.72 --> 00:58:21.08
You'll recall that on the subject of training habits, I said that men will do in combat.

884
00:58:21.08 --> 00:58:24.92
What they have been taught and practice in training.

885
00:58:24.92 --> 00:58:27.84
This is equally true in the area of maintenance.

886
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:32.44
For in combat, high maintenance standards become a matter of life and death of equal

887
00:58:32.44 --> 00:58:35.76
significance is supply economy.

888
00:58:35.76 --> 00:58:41.72
That wasted bullet or gallon of gas may seem insignificant now, but what a difference

889
00:58:41.72 --> 00:58:45.28
it may make when the chips are down exclamation point.

890
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:46.76
I think that's the only exclamation point.

891
00:58:46.76 --> 00:58:50.04
He uses in this book.

892
00:58:50.04 --> 00:58:56.80
You train how you fight and if you're allowed to be sloppy or cut corners and not do the

893
00:58:56.80 --> 00:59:02.92
maintenance, where you're going to end up in a bad way.

894
00:59:02.92 --> 00:59:08.72
Good leadership on the company level can only thrive in a climate of good commander ship

895
00:59:08.72 --> 00:59:12.000
on the battalion level and above.

896
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.88
What company commanders have a right to expect from commanders above?

897
00:59:18.88 --> 00:59:23.32
So here, look, if you're working, if you're a boss, this is what you should be providing

898
00:59:23.32 --> 00:59:25.36
to the people below you.

899
00:59:25.36 --> 00:59:31.44
That their honest errors be pointed out, but be underwritten at least once in the interest

900
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:34.20
of developing initiative and leadership.

901
00:59:34.20 --> 00:59:35.52
Boom.

902
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:36.88
What does that mean?

903
00:59:36.88 --> 00:59:42.84
It means if someone makes mistake one time, you don't drop the hammer on them, you

904
00:59:42.84 --> 00:59:47.92
show them support that they had initiative, that they showed good leadership.

905
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:50.20
So that's what we're supposed to point them out.

906
00:59:50.20 --> 00:59:54.88
Hey Dave, bad initiative or good initiative, bad judgment.

907
00:59:54.88 --> 00:59:59.16
You know, I like that you took action, but let's think through the action that you

908
00:59:59.16 --> 01:00:00.16
took.

909
01:00:00.16 --> 01:00:01.72
That's fine.

910
01:00:01.72 --> 01:00:08.96
To be responsible for and be allowed to develop their own units with only essential guidance

911
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:12.88
from above.

912
01:00:12.88 --> 01:00:18.36
You are responsible for developing, however you want to do it, Dave, you got your team,

913
01:00:18.36 --> 01:00:20.56
however you want to develop that team.

914
01:00:20.56 --> 01:00:25.24
Here's the minimum requirements and this is the mission.

915
01:00:25.24 --> 01:00:26.64
Only the essential guidance.

916
01:00:26.64 --> 01:00:27.64
What do we say?

917
01:00:27.64 --> 01:00:29.28
We say minimum force required.

918
01:00:29.28 --> 01:00:32.72
We want to lead with a minimum force required.

919
01:00:32.72 --> 01:00:40.20
A helpful attitude toward their problems, loyalty down as well as up, that they not be subjected

920
01:00:40.20 --> 01:00:49.36
to the needling of unproductive statistics, competitions between like units, just harassing

921
01:00:49.36 --> 01:00:56.48
people, the best in command or ship, that the needs of their units be anticipated and provided

922
01:00:56.48 --> 01:00:57.48
for.

923
01:00:57.48 --> 01:01:01.44
That's not too much to ask that I anticipate that Dave's going to need more bullets or

924
01:01:01.44 --> 01:01:04.16
more ammunition or more fuel.

925
01:01:04.16 --> 01:01:10.88
And I have it for him to be kept oriented as to the mission and situation of the unit

926
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:16.96
above, well, fought out program of training, work and recreation, good training and work

927
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:21.92
management to receive timely, clear cut and positive orders and decisions which are not

928
01:01:21.92 --> 01:01:26.28
constantly changed.

929
01:01:26.28 --> 01:01:32.36
The integrity of their tactical units be maintained in assigning essential tasks.

930
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:35.84
That was so smart.

931
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:37.32
That was a little trick that I did.

932
01:01:37.32 --> 01:01:40.64
I would keep my little fire teams together, keep the squad together as much as I could

933
01:01:40.64 --> 01:01:42.36
I could keep the platoon together as much as I could look.

934
01:01:42.36 --> 01:01:43.96
We were interoperable.

935
01:01:43.96 --> 01:01:48.88
But if you can keep a fire team together, they are so good to go.

936
01:01:48.88 --> 01:01:50.36
You want them tied.

937
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:58.24
You think a couple of them you said anticipate the needs of their units be anticipated and

938
01:01:58.24 --> 01:01:59.24
provided for them.

939
01:01:59.24 --> 01:02:02.40
Think about that word though that the needs are anticipated.

940
01:02:02.40 --> 01:02:03.84
That is a real word in there.

941
01:02:03.84 --> 01:02:05.08
That is not, I'm here.

942
01:02:05.08 --> 01:02:07.52
Hey, when you run out of stuff, come up and tell me, hey, and you run it through the

943
01:02:07.52 --> 01:02:11.000
chain and command and give me the the triple kit paperwork to give you what you need.

944
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.92
It's me knowing what's going on down there and going, hey, Jocco, you're the team

945
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:15.88
who have been getting after it man.

946
01:02:15.88 --> 01:02:17.84
How's your stash of this supplier?

947
01:02:17.84 --> 01:02:18.84
How's this going on here?

948
01:02:18.84 --> 01:02:19.84
Are you running low?

949
01:02:19.84 --> 01:02:23.84
Work in this not to get this to you and you're thinking damn.

950
01:02:23.84 --> 01:02:25.32
He didn't just cut us loose.

951
01:02:25.32 --> 01:02:28.88
He's actually paying attention when it's going on down here and I was about to send up

952
01:02:28.88 --> 01:02:32.36
the request but I don't like asking my boss for stuff so I was kind of worried about

953
01:02:32.36 --> 01:02:36.04
asking him and he's thinking, I've noticed you guys have been cranking, do you need some

954
01:02:36.04 --> 01:02:37.04
of this?

955
01:02:37.04 --> 01:02:38.88
You're anticipating the needs.

956
01:02:38.88 --> 01:02:42.40
Not just responding to their needs but actually thinking about it.

957
01:02:42.40 --> 01:02:46.28
I mean, you want to talk about being a commander, being a leader, knowing what your people

958
01:02:46.28 --> 01:02:49.80
are going through and giving them what they need before they have to ask for it.

959
01:02:49.80 --> 01:02:51.80
That word is no small word.

960
01:02:51.80 --> 01:02:52.80
Yeah.

961
01:02:52.80 --> 01:03:00.80
And then the parsing of that word that you just used could clarify that for everyone here.

962
01:03:00.80 --> 01:03:06.24
You said you need to actually think about it.

963
01:03:06.24 --> 01:03:07.24
What does that mean?

964
01:03:07.24 --> 01:03:10.68
That means while you're daydreaming while you're sitting around doing whatever you're

965
01:03:10.68 --> 01:03:14.60
doing this anticipation isn't just going to come and smack you in the face.

966
01:03:14.60 --> 01:03:16.000
You need to set aside a little time.

967
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.32
You need to look at what that unit's doing.

968
01:03:17.32 --> 01:03:22.12
You need to figure out you need to actually think about what's going on.

969
01:03:22.12 --> 01:03:25.88
What a novel idea.

970
01:03:25.88 --> 01:03:31.88
That reminds me of way the warrior kid where the first one, Mark thinks he should know

971
01:03:31.88 --> 01:03:34.60
his times tables and Uncle J.X.

972
01:03:34.60 --> 01:03:37.36
will have you studied and he says, what do you mean study?

973
01:03:37.36 --> 01:03:38.36
I should just know him.

974
01:03:38.36 --> 01:03:39.36
No.

975
01:03:39.36 --> 01:03:42.12
And you're not going to be able to just randomly anticipate people's needs.

976
01:03:42.12 --> 01:03:45.96
You need to actually think about it.

977
01:03:45.96 --> 01:03:49.40
And the last one in this chapter.

978
01:03:49.40 --> 01:03:51.20
Oh, sorry, not the last one yet.

979
01:03:51.20 --> 01:03:57.68
That their successes be measured by the overall ability of a unit to perform its whole mission

980
01:03:57.68 --> 01:04:01.04
and not by the performance of one or two factors.

981
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:04.32
So look at people holistically.

982
01:04:04.32 --> 01:04:05.64
Look at units holistically.

983
01:04:05.64 --> 01:04:10.20
And then this is the last one that good works by their units be recognized and rewarded

984
01:04:10.20 --> 01:04:14.84
in such a way as to motivate the greatest number to do well and seek further improvement.

985
01:04:14.84 --> 01:04:15.84
Good.

986
01:04:15.84 --> 01:04:21.56
Now we're going to roll into chapter two.

987
01:04:21.56 --> 01:04:25.08
This is called leadership versus popularity.

988
01:04:25.08 --> 01:04:26.08
And this is interesting.

989
01:04:26.08 --> 01:04:31.56
This is where I start to sometimes when I'm reading leadership things in my way.

990
01:04:31.56 --> 01:04:33.44
Wow, that's really not my viewpoint.

991
01:04:33.44 --> 01:04:34.44
Hold on a second.

992
01:04:34.44 --> 01:04:35.44
Like this is a little.

993
01:04:35.44 --> 01:04:40.48
And then I continue to read and I find, oh, he's saying it a little bit differently

994
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:45.48
but he or he sometimes people are actually saying something different but they don't

995
01:04:45.48 --> 01:04:46.48
even mean it.

996
01:04:46.48 --> 01:04:48.20
They don't even mean it.

997
01:04:48.20 --> 01:04:49.64
And you're just to see what I'm talking about.

998
01:04:49.64 --> 01:04:56.44
So leadership versus popularity, the example of a strong leader.

999
01:04:56.44 --> 01:05:01.16
During the World War II period, I served as a division commander.

1000
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:07.48
I served a division commander as his chief of staff and later as one of his combat commanders

1001
01:05:07.48 --> 01:05:09.56
for a period of over two years.

1002
01:05:09.56 --> 01:05:12.24
He was a strong character and a strong leader.

1003
01:05:12.24 --> 01:05:17.04
He had firm ideas about things that he liked and disliked and placed requirements on his

1004
01:05:17.04 --> 01:05:22.12
officers and men in the fields of wearing equipment and uniforms tactical disposition during

1005
01:05:22.12 --> 01:05:27.76
field training, the care and handling of vehicles and other things, many of which were

1006
01:05:27.76 --> 01:05:29.76
unpopular.

1007
01:05:29.76 --> 01:05:34.60
At one time in an evening discussion period, I pointed out that these requirements to him and

1008
01:05:34.60 --> 01:05:40.12
asked him if he felt that the effort he put into them was not excessive for the practical

1009
01:05:40.12 --> 01:05:42.12
results which he achieved.

1010
01:05:42.12 --> 01:05:47.96
His answer gave me insight into the problems of training and preparations and preparing

1011
01:05:47.96 --> 01:05:54.48
troops for emergencies or battle for which I've never forgotten.

1012
01:05:54.48 --> 01:06:00.56
He stated that in case of an emergency or battle, a commander was required to place upon

1013
01:06:00.56 --> 01:06:05.84
his officers and men many requirements that were unpopular and for which time was not available

1014
01:06:05.84 --> 01:06:07.08
for hesitation.

1015
01:06:07.08 --> 01:06:13.32
The thought of being popular or unpopular should never enter the mind of a commander.

1016
01:06:13.32 --> 01:06:18.04
That's the part where I start going, heesh, wait a second, what are we talking about?

1017
01:06:18.04 --> 01:06:22.20
I'm not totally there yet, but I'm a little nervous because what this translates to and

1018
01:06:22.20 --> 01:06:25.36
Lafes talked about this before.

1019
01:06:25.36 --> 01:06:32.72
Lafes had someone come and speak to the junior officers and senior officers and the message

1020
01:06:32.72 --> 01:06:39.60
was, in no uncertain terms, when you're in charge, you should not be liked.

1021
01:06:39.60 --> 01:06:40.60
You should not be liked.

1022
01:06:40.60 --> 01:06:42.52
When you're in charge, you're going to make all these hardices.

1023
01:06:42.52 --> 01:06:43.52
People aren't going to like you.

1024
01:06:43.52 --> 01:06:44.96
You need to be okay with that.

1025
01:06:44.96 --> 01:06:48.88
Lafes had to kind of like when this senior officer would leave, Lafes had to like back

1026
01:06:48.88 --> 01:06:57.24
these guys down and say, listen, let me put that in perspective.

1027
01:06:57.24 --> 01:07:03.52
So this is he pointed out that a commander who was unable to obtain compliance with unpopular

1028
01:07:03.52 --> 01:07:07.76
requirements from his officers or men during training and during preparation for combat

1029
01:07:07.76 --> 01:07:13.16
would not be able to obtain prompt compliance with his requirements to meet emergencies or

1030
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:15.56
to attack an enemy in battle.

1031
01:07:15.56 --> 01:07:20.96
He said that the requirements he placed in the training periods served three purposes.

1032
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:26.44
One, they conditioned his command to carry out promptly his instructions to the way which

1033
01:07:26.44 --> 01:07:32.88
his men carried out these requirements served as a constant measure to him of his old on

1034
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:39.56
his officers and his men and they with other things helped instill a fierce pride in the

1035
01:07:39.56 --> 01:07:42.40
division.

1036
01:07:42.40 --> 01:07:46.36
I might add that this officer was one of the most respected division commanders that

1037
01:07:46.36 --> 01:07:52.08
I have known even now over 15 years after he left the division, he is the most popular

1038
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:56.88
man present when the division association has a convention.

1039
01:07:56.88 --> 01:08:00.24
So all this talk about him not being concerned about me, oh, he is the most popular guy.

1040
01:08:00.24 --> 01:08:01.44
I love him, yeah.

1041
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:03.20
Everybody loves this guy.

1042
01:08:03.20 --> 01:08:04.36
Why do they love this guy?

1043
01:08:04.36 --> 01:08:06.04
Do they love him because he was nice?

1044
01:08:06.04 --> 01:08:10.36
Do they love him because he gave him extra brownies and ice cream?

1045
01:08:10.36 --> 01:08:11.36
No.

1046
01:08:11.36 --> 01:08:15.76
He loved them because he was dis, they loved him because he was disciplined.

1047
01:08:15.76 --> 01:08:20.72
That's what they loved.

1048
01:08:20.72 --> 01:08:25.76
Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered

1049
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:30.12
the procedure off and I was actually when I first read this thing, I thought he was talking

1050
01:08:30.12 --> 01:08:34.72
about patent because he worked for patent but patent wasn't alive 15 years later to be

1051
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:35.72
the most popular guy.

1052
01:08:35.72 --> 01:08:36.92
So I don't know who it was.

1053
01:08:36.92 --> 01:08:41.24
I have to do more research.

1054
01:08:41.24 --> 01:08:44.08
And this says an unpopular requirement that paid off.

1055
01:08:44.08 --> 01:08:47.88
Later on when I was placed in command of a combat command of the division, I remembered

1056
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:53.000
the procedure often used at 11 worth of attacking at first light in the morning.

1057
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.06
One of the reasons for doing this was in hopes of catching the enemy unprepared to resist

1058
01:08:57.06 --> 01:08:58.06
attack.

1059
01:08:58.06 --> 01:09:02.96
If we were taught this, if we were taught this, probably the enemy did likewise because

1060
01:09:02.96 --> 01:09:08.56
of this whenever I had combat command in the field for training, I required every man to

1061
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:12.76
be up, dressed and manning his battle station at first light.

1062
01:09:12.76 --> 01:09:16.84
Communications were checked all the way from squad level to me and reports of readiness

1063
01:09:16.84 --> 01:09:20.28
were laid from the squad level to me.

1064
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:24.44
After daylight, and if it was decided that no attack was probable, the troops were permitted

1065
01:09:24.44 --> 01:09:27.44
to eat breakfast and then proceed with the day's activities.

1066
01:09:27.44 --> 01:09:30.68
I talked about this on the earliest of podcasts.

1067
01:09:30.68 --> 01:09:35.60
This early morning stand to, that's what it's called, was never popular and there

1068
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:40.24
would be many requests to relax the requirement of it, particularly for men who had been

1069
01:09:40.24 --> 01:09:41.68
on guard or night duty.

1070
01:09:41.68 --> 01:09:45.76
While these requests were never granted, because these requests were never granted because

1071
01:09:45.76 --> 01:09:50.84
I felt that if we were overrun while still asleep, the enemy would not spare the man who

1072
01:09:50.84 --> 01:09:56.80
had been late getting into bed.

1073
01:09:56.80 --> 01:10:01.64
This procedure was followed in my command throughout the war.

1074
01:10:01.64 --> 01:10:05.84
I can say that even in the face of the enemy, it was not particularly popular.

1075
01:10:05.84 --> 01:10:10.56
So even though even in combat, guys were like, bro, let me sleep in, sir, let me sleep

1076
01:10:10.56 --> 01:10:11.56
in.

1077
01:10:11.56 --> 01:10:12.56
Even in combat.

1078
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:15.68
Even in combat, where the enemy might really attack and kill you and overrun you

1079
01:10:15.68 --> 01:10:20.24
and people will say, hey, man, can we just get some sleep in the morning?

1080
01:10:20.24 --> 01:10:24.32
But he never, he never submitted to that.

1081
01:10:24.32 --> 01:10:30.32
And he said, however, it did save elements of my command on several occasions from being

1082
01:10:30.32 --> 01:10:33.08
overrun and destroyed in the early morning.

1083
01:10:33.08 --> 01:10:37.16
At one time, a portion of the 37th tank battalion.

1084
01:10:37.16 --> 01:10:38.16
How cool is that?

1085
01:10:38.16 --> 01:10:39.16
The 137.

1086
01:10:39.16 --> 01:10:40.16
The 7th.

1087
01:10:40.16 --> 01:10:43.76
Shout out to the bandits battle over a body.

1088
01:10:43.76 --> 01:10:48.94
A portion of the 37th tank battalion was saved from destruction by an enemy tank brigade

1089
01:10:48.94 --> 01:10:52.92
attack in the fog at first light because it was ready.

1090
01:10:52.92 --> 01:10:55.64
This particular requirement was probably most unpopular.

1091
01:10:55.64 --> 01:11:00.000
My combat command headquarters and there was considerable griping about it on many occasions.

1092
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.16
However, one morning when my command was in the rear of the enemy lines east of Nancy,

1093
01:11:06.16 --> 01:11:09.76
the headquarters personnel were alert at first light, men were manning their defensive

1094
01:11:09.76 --> 01:11:10.76
positions.

1095
01:11:10.76 --> 01:11:12.96
Weapons had been checked at communications at the beginning of the established.

1096
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:17.96
In particular, the three tank destroyers attached to my headquarters were in position loaded

1097
01:11:17.96 --> 01:11:19.96
and manned.

1098
01:11:19.96 --> 01:11:26.32
At first light, a platoon of enemy tanks came into the headquarters area, which in the case

1099
01:11:26.32 --> 01:11:30.000
of a combat command headquarters was not very large.

1100
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.32
The tank destroyers immediately took them under fire and succeeded in knocking out three

1101
01:11:34.32 --> 01:11:35.40
of the tanks.

1102
01:11:35.40 --> 01:11:37.52
The other two withdrew.

1103
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:41.52
Our loss during this engagement was only one tank destroyer, which was destroyed by a direct

1104
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:42.92
hit from one of the enemy tanks.

1105
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:47.72
There was much discussion of this attack in the headquarters in the days that followed.

1106
01:11:47.72 --> 01:11:51.48
One of the men stated that he never realized how crowded a combat command headquarters

1107
01:11:51.48 --> 01:11:56.04
could be when an enemy attack came.

1108
01:11:56.04 --> 01:12:01.80
I heard no more comments in my headquarters about the requirement for everybody being dressed

1109
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:04.08
alert in position in daylight.

1110
01:12:04.08 --> 01:12:09.48
The purpose of this account is to point out that a commander and leader owes a responsibility

1111
01:12:09.48 --> 01:12:17.000
to his men to require them to do things which are for their own benefit and for the benefit

1112
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:25.04
of the command as a whole, even though their requirements are not popular.

1113
01:12:25.04 --> 01:12:30.80
So you want to follow a threat, you want to follow a threat, go read the book about face

1114
01:12:30.80 --> 01:12:36.40
and read what hack worth did when he took over the 439.

1115
01:12:36.40 --> 01:12:39.92
Let's see, it's the exact same story.

1116
01:12:39.92 --> 01:12:42.96
What he made these guys do was change their, you had to dig a hole to the sleep first of

1117
01:12:42.96 --> 01:12:43.96
all.

1118
01:12:43.96 --> 01:12:45.76
They actually started digging in.

1119
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:47.48
They started moving their positions every night.

1120
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:50.44
They started expanding the perimeter, retract their perimeter and by the way, when you dig

1121
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:55.28
a hole in Vietnam or really anywhere, when you dig a fighting hole, a fighting position and

1122
01:12:55.28 --> 01:12:56.28
then you're going to move.

1123
01:12:56.28 --> 01:12:59.16
Guess what you got to do with that one that you just left.

1124
01:12:59.16 --> 01:13:00.80
You got to fill it in.

1125
01:13:00.80 --> 01:13:05.16
So if we put out the perimeter and then we move back that night 25 or 50 meters because we

1126
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:08.52
don't want to get mortgages, we know the enemy saw where we were were.

1127
01:13:08.52 --> 01:13:12.16
We got to fill in that fighting position because we don't want the enemy to be able to use

1128
01:13:12.16 --> 01:13:13.16
it.

1129
01:13:13.16 --> 01:13:14.64
So that's a lot of digging to be doing.

1130
01:13:14.64 --> 01:13:18.04
To be doing, well guess what, he did this hack worth did this.

1131
01:13:18.04 --> 01:13:24.36
Hey, they got rid of all the crap that they had in their battalion CP, they got rid of

1132
01:13:24.36 --> 01:13:25.36
all that junk.

1133
01:13:25.36 --> 01:13:28.58
They started digging in, they started moving their perimeter and the first time they got

1134
01:13:28.58 --> 01:13:31.16
mortgard under his command.

1135
01:13:31.16 --> 01:13:34.20
There were no casualties because the elements had moved and guess what?

1136
01:13:34.20 --> 01:13:36.44
There was no more complaining.

1137
01:13:36.44 --> 01:13:38.08
This is the exact same story.

1138
01:13:38.08 --> 01:13:40.80
I wonder where Hack worth figured that out from.

1139
01:13:40.80 --> 01:13:44.80
Totally.

1140
01:13:44.80 --> 01:13:47.48
Next chapter.

1141
01:13:47.48 --> 01:13:52.68
Ethics, conduct, and standards of officers.

1142
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:53.68
Subtitle.

1143
01:13:53.68 --> 01:13:58.56
Set an example.

1144
01:13:58.56 --> 01:14:00.20
What you know, I had such a good benefit.

1145
01:14:00.20 --> 01:14:05.60
I benefited the luck that I had in my career in my life is amazing, but one of the most

1146
01:14:05.60 --> 01:14:11.16
amazing things is when I was a young and listed guy in the SEAL teams, I was watching

1147
01:14:11.16 --> 01:14:14.20
my lieutenant.

1148
01:14:14.20 --> 01:14:16.16
I was tracking.

1149
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:18.68
I was tracking those boys.

1150
01:14:18.68 --> 01:14:23.24
When they forgot to piece of gear, I was like, oh, when they were late, oh, I was tracking

1151
01:14:23.24 --> 01:14:24.24
them.

1152
01:14:24.24 --> 01:14:25.24
I knew that.

1153
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:30.08
I knew I knew better than anyone could have ever taught me or told me.

1154
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:31.28
I was like, well, we're sitting here saying this.

1155
01:14:31.28 --> 01:14:32.28
You've said it five times today.

1156
01:14:32.28 --> 01:14:33.64
I've said it eight times today.

1157
01:14:33.64 --> 01:14:34.96
Your people are watching you.

1158
01:14:34.96 --> 01:14:36.04
Your people are watching you.

1159
01:14:36.04 --> 01:14:37.04
Your people are watching you.

1160
01:14:37.04 --> 01:14:40.16
I could have been told that a hundred times and it wouldn't have been as effective as

1161
01:14:40.16 --> 01:14:45.44
me actually knowing what it was like to watch my my bosses.

1162
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:48.68
And note the good and note the bad.

1163
01:14:48.68 --> 01:14:50.16
Set an example.

1164
01:14:50.16 --> 01:14:55.64
The ethics, conduct, and standards of behavior of a few of our officers are matters of

1165
01:14:55.64 --> 01:14:57.16
real concern to me.

1166
01:14:57.16 --> 01:15:01.36
Except for a few junior officers, our officers are either regular officers or reserve

1167
01:15:01.36 --> 01:15:04.84
officers serving because they chose to do so.

1168
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:09.12
It is up to the latter group to set the proper example in all things for those junior

1169
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:10.12
officers.

1170
01:15:10.12 --> 01:15:15.40
It is up to all officers to conduct themselves in such a manner that the prestige of the

1171
01:15:15.40 --> 01:15:23.60
army officer will be high in the eyes of the public and of our enlisted men.

1172
01:15:23.60 --> 01:15:32.40
And officer who behaves in an unbecoming manner destroys his standing in a unit.

1173
01:15:32.40 --> 01:15:37.04
Man, if we broke out and started talking about what's unbecoming for a leader.

1174
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:40.64
Because you know, when you hear the word conduct, I'm becoming an officer.

1175
01:15:40.64 --> 01:15:42.24
You think like, oh, this guy is out.

1176
01:15:42.24 --> 01:15:43.68
Lack of like an idiot.

1177
01:15:43.68 --> 01:15:47.40
What about when that guy shows up 12 minutes late?

1178
01:15:47.40 --> 01:15:49.80
What about when that guy does bring the right piece of gear?

1179
01:15:49.80 --> 01:15:51.52
What about when that guy loses temper?

1180
01:15:51.52 --> 01:15:53.52
Whatever it is.

1181
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:54.52
All those little things.

1182
01:15:54.52 --> 01:15:55.52
Yeah.

1183
01:15:55.52 --> 01:15:57.96
All those little things add up.

1184
01:15:57.96 --> 01:16:02.52
And if you were a leader in an organization, you got to understand that your people are

1185
01:16:02.52 --> 01:16:04.000
watching you.

1186
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.40
And what that actually is is an opportunity to pull them into your sphere of influence.

1187
01:16:08.40 --> 01:16:12.96
Because as a young Marine, I was looking for role models too.

1188
01:16:12.96 --> 01:16:17.08
I was looking when I was keeping track of those little things at little slip here, that

1189
01:16:17.08 --> 01:16:19.52
little slack over here, that little error here.

1190
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:22.96
And I was looking around when I saw the ones that were holding the line.

1191
01:16:22.96 --> 01:16:24.44
That's where I wanted to be.

1192
01:16:24.44 --> 01:16:29.20
And if you're that leader, you will pull these people into your sphere of influence.

1193
01:16:29.20 --> 01:16:30.80
And you can lead and match them.

1194
01:16:30.80 --> 01:16:37.68
And you can have, you can design the culture of the entire unit by yourself just by

1195
01:16:37.68 --> 01:16:39.28
setting that right example.

1196
01:16:39.28 --> 01:16:42.08
Because you will pull people into your sphere.

1197
01:16:42.08 --> 01:16:44.88
And they will follow that lead and they will do the same thing.

1198
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:48.000
And then all of a sudden you got folks down the organization that aren't holding the

1199
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
line.

1200
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.60
You don't have to be the one to go down there and fix it.

1201
01:16:50.60 --> 01:16:55.08
Because you've got this little army of people on your little team that are doing that

1202
01:16:55.08 --> 01:16:58.24
across the organization.

1203
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:01.88
So I was in the teams back in the day.

1204
01:17:01.88 --> 01:17:04.40
And I was getting ready.

1205
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:11.28
I think I was actually I had been picked up for the Seaman to Admiral program.

1206
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:14.84
So I was I had been picked up.

1207
01:17:14.84 --> 01:17:16.36
And I was super stoked.

1208
01:17:16.36 --> 01:17:18.04
And I was, but I was still at Seal team one.

1209
01:17:18.04 --> 01:17:22.04
I had finished out my time there before I went to Austria candidate school.

1210
01:17:22.04 --> 01:17:24.88
And then I would go from off-stricated school.

1211
01:17:24.88 --> 01:17:26.24
So I either had been picked up.

1212
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:29.04
I think I'd been picked up.

1213
01:17:29.04 --> 01:17:37.40
But another guy, another officer, another prior and listed officer who did the program that

1214
01:17:37.40 --> 01:17:39.04
I was doing.

1215
01:17:39.04 --> 01:17:40.04
Right?

1216
01:17:40.04 --> 01:17:45.20
And he'd been picked up and he had gone to off-stricated school and then he showed up at

1217
01:17:45.20 --> 01:17:46.52
Seal team one.

1218
01:17:46.52 --> 01:17:50.40
So he was, you know, he was almost, he was very similar to me in the fact that we were both

1219
01:17:50.40 --> 01:17:52.24
prior and listed guys, he got picked up.

1220
01:17:52.24 --> 01:17:54.72
I think it was one year ahead of me.

1221
01:17:54.72 --> 01:17:56.68
And he shows up at Seal team one.

1222
01:17:56.68 --> 01:18:00.92
And I remember seeing this dude for the first time.

1223
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:08.28
And look, you know, I just looked at him and I was like, damn, this dude is squared away.

1224
01:18:08.28 --> 01:18:11.72
And I couldn't even really, I couldn't even really understand.

1225
01:18:11.72 --> 01:18:16.48
I said, well, why does this guy's whole uniform look?

1226
01:18:16.48 --> 01:18:17.76
Square to away.

1227
01:18:17.76 --> 01:18:20.72
This guy looks like he's on another level.

1228
01:18:20.72 --> 01:18:24.28
And you know, wearing the locker room or whatever, well, guess what?

1229
01:18:24.28 --> 01:18:25.88
He was wearing shirt stays.

1230
01:18:25.88 --> 01:18:26.88
Do you know what those are?

1231
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:27.88
I do.

1232
01:18:27.88 --> 01:18:29.16
I'm the one who you do.

1233
01:18:29.16 --> 01:18:35.16
So he was wearing shirt stays, which is the way that you roll with at OCS.

1234
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:36.56
It's like, you're wearing shirt stays.

1235
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:37.56
That's all there's to it.

1236
01:18:37.56 --> 01:18:39.72
So for those of you who don't know it, what shirts stays are.

1237
01:18:39.72 --> 01:18:47.92
They are a piece of elastic material that you attach from the bottom of your shirt,

1238
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:53.72
which is tucked in and they run down your legs and then they attach to your socks.

1239
01:18:53.72 --> 01:18:58.04
So no matter what happens, your shirt is freaking stay and put.

1240
01:18:58.04 --> 01:19:02.04
And it looks like it looks like the uniform on a mannequin.

1241
01:19:02.04 --> 01:19:03.40
It looks like that.

1242
01:19:03.40 --> 01:19:06.20
Somebody dressed this thing for a mannequin.

1243
01:19:06.20 --> 01:19:09.56
And so I remember seeing it going damn, and he just looked everything looks squared

1244
01:19:09.56 --> 01:19:10.56
away about him.

1245
01:19:10.56 --> 01:19:12.16
He was an awesome physical shape.

1246
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:13.16
Just a great guy.

1247
01:19:13.16 --> 01:19:16.92
And he is an incredible guy.

1248
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:20.16
But I remember looking him going damn, this dude is squared away.

1249
01:19:20.16 --> 01:19:21.16
And I saw those shirts stays.

1250
01:19:21.16 --> 01:19:22.28
I didn't even know what those were.

1251
01:19:22.28 --> 01:19:23.96
As an enlisted seal.

1252
01:19:23.96 --> 01:19:24.96
You had no idea.

1253
01:19:24.96 --> 01:19:27.24
Showed up at OCS.

1254
01:19:27.24 --> 01:19:29.28
And you know what?

1255
01:19:29.28 --> 01:19:30.28
Those shirts stays.

1256
01:19:30.28 --> 01:19:34.56
Because pretty much when you're done with OCS, you'd know, really need to wear them anymore.

1257
01:19:34.56 --> 01:19:35.56
Yeah.

1258
01:19:35.56 --> 01:19:36.56
Guess what?

1259
01:19:36.56 --> 01:19:37.56
He did.

1260
01:19:37.56 --> 01:19:38.56
He did.

1261
01:19:38.56 --> 01:19:39.48
And I did.

1262
01:19:39.48 --> 01:19:44.04
I freaking wore those things religiously because that's the difference.

1263
01:19:44.04 --> 01:19:45.40
That's the difference.

1264
01:19:45.40 --> 01:19:46.80
That's setting the example.

1265
01:19:46.80 --> 01:19:48.40
You better look squared away.

1266
01:19:48.40 --> 01:19:49.40
Yes.

1267
01:19:49.40 --> 01:19:50.40
About 100%.

1268
01:19:50.40 --> 01:19:51.40
Oh, the time.

1269
01:19:51.40 --> 01:19:53.04
Where do you not want to look squared away?

1270
01:19:53.04 --> 01:19:57.08
And look, if you got long-term plans and you want to build a team and you got long-term

1271
01:19:57.08 --> 01:20:01.04
plans of having a good team around you, start early.

1272
01:20:01.04 --> 01:20:05.80
I remember joining my first quadrant and there is the training officer bill.

1273
01:20:05.80 --> 01:20:06.80
It's called the training officer.

1274
01:20:06.80 --> 01:20:09.56
It's like the senior of the junior officers.

1275
01:20:09.56 --> 01:20:13.44
So it's like kind of like that's elevated himself amongst all the junior pilots that's kind

1276
01:20:13.44 --> 01:20:15.24
of an a key leadership role.

1277
01:20:15.24 --> 01:20:18.88
And I remember seeing a training and you see a squared away training officer like I want

1278
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:19.88
to be like that guy.

1279
01:20:19.88 --> 01:20:22.20
And then that training officer would go away and then a couple of years later he'd come

1280
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:27.48
back to a squadron and he'd be the ops officer, which is like a senior of the middle guys.

1281
01:20:27.48 --> 01:20:29.36
And he'd be squared away by the time.

1282
01:20:29.36 --> 01:20:33.64
And this guy that that I worked with in my squadron, by the time that guy came back to be

1283
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:38.40
a squadron commander who had been squared away from day one, dudes are running down to

1284
01:20:38.40 --> 01:20:41.72
headquarters with cases of very like I want to get in this guy's squadron.

1285
01:20:41.72 --> 01:20:44.72
People were fighting to get into his unit.

1286
01:20:44.72 --> 01:20:46.08
Was that because he was nice?

1287
01:20:46.08 --> 01:20:47.08
Yeah.

1288
01:20:47.08 --> 01:20:48.84
Was that because he gave people extra liberty?

1289
01:20:48.84 --> 01:20:53.32
Because he was squared away and he held the line and we all wanted to be like him.

1290
01:20:53.32 --> 01:20:56.32
And he didn't like wake up one day like, oh, I'm a commander now.

1291
01:20:56.32 --> 01:20:58.08
I guess I got to square myself away.

1292
01:20:58.08 --> 01:20:59.08
He'd been like that forever.

1293
01:20:59.08 --> 01:21:01.28
Dude's were fighting to get in his unit.

1294
01:21:01.28 --> 01:21:04.72
You know, I was talking about leadership capital the other day on EF online because somebody

1295
01:21:04.72 --> 01:21:06.04
asked a question about it.

1296
01:21:06.04 --> 01:21:14.64
And one of the things is your reputation can contain a positive bank account of leadership

1297
01:21:14.64 --> 01:21:15.64
capital.

1298
01:21:15.64 --> 01:21:16.64
Yeah.

1299
01:21:16.64 --> 01:21:20.48
It can also contain a negative bank account of leadership capital.

1300
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:24.04
And if you're not, if you just decide that you're going to get squared away when you're

1301
01:21:24.04 --> 01:21:26.84
putting charge, if that's when you make that decision, you're rolling in there with all kinds

1302
01:21:26.84 --> 01:21:28.32
of negative bank account.

1303
01:21:28.32 --> 01:21:30.04
It's a disaster.

1304
01:21:30.04 --> 01:21:31.04
You're with people.

1305
01:21:31.04 --> 01:21:34.28
You don't even know your reputation expense well beyond the people that you hang out

1306
01:21:34.28 --> 01:21:35.28
with.

1307
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:36.28
Oh, for sure.

1308
01:21:36.28 --> 01:21:38.12
In these communities, people know you have heard of you.

1309
01:21:38.12 --> 01:21:42.000
People are going to run towards you or avoid you and you don't even know who they are.

1310
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.48
And it's all going to be based on your account with them.

1311
01:21:45.48 --> 01:21:47.92
How much leadership capital you've built.

1312
01:21:47.92 --> 01:21:51.40
And it goes well beyond the sphere that you think you're part of.

1313
01:21:51.40 --> 01:21:56.08
Everybody knows you in those leadership roles and they're watching you.

1314
01:21:56.08 --> 01:21:57.08
Back to the book.

1315
01:21:57.08 --> 01:21:59.92
And then have no further respect for him.

1316
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:04.52
This is for the guy that that behaves and conduct, unbecoming of an officer.

1317
01:22:04.52 --> 01:22:10.44
The enlistment have no further respect for him and he can no longer lead or command effectively.

1318
01:22:10.44 --> 01:22:14.88
His value to his unit's laundry been distraught when an officer accepts his commission.

1319
01:22:14.88 --> 01:22:18.88
He is presumed to have had enough experience to have acquired the ethical and moral

1320
01:22:18.88 --> 01:22:21.72
precepts expected of an officer in a gentleman.

1321
01:22:21.72 --> 01:22:27.44
The record of long services not an excuse for laxity in this matter.

1322
01:22:27.44 --> 01:22:30.12
Damn, he's coming off the top of the right there.

1323
01:22:30.12 --> 01:22:36.12
I just put myself in mental check for my whole life.

1324
01:22:36.12 --> 01:22:43.20
Too often incidents are brought to my attention involving the intent of use of alcohol.

1325
01:22:43.20 --> 01:22:46.52
Drunk and miss at any time in place is disgraceful.

1326
01:22:46.52 --> 01:22:55.24
When combined with the operation of a motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.

1327
01:22:55.24 --> 01:22:56.68
Drunk driving didn't used to be a thing.

1328
01:22:56.68 --> 01:22:57.68
Do you know that?

1329
01:22:57.68 --> 01:23:00.76
Yeah, I'm driving didn't used to be a fail.

1330
01:23:00.76 --> 01:23:04.72
It was a badge of honor back in the day on some units.

1331
01:23:04.72 --> 01:23:15.72
When my dad crashed a car drunk in like 1955 or something and the cop like pulled his car

1332
01:23:15.72 --> 01:23:16.72
out the camera right home.

1333
01:23:16.72 --> 01:23:21.64
I mean, my dad was like, whatever, 19 or something.

1334
01:23:21.64 --> 01:23:26.96
And I got hit by a drunk driver when I was kid on a bicycle.

1335
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:28.84
And I got hit by a drunk driver.

1336
01:23:28.84 --> 01:23:30.28
I got thrown off my bike.

1337
01:23:30.28 --> 01:23:33.72
I had to get stitches in my head.

1338
01:23:33.72 --> 01:23:39.64
And my dad was like, oh yeah, it was almost like, it was almost like, well, you know,

1339
01:23:39.64 --> 01:23:42.48
you had a little too much drink, no, no factor.

1340
01:23:42.48 --> 01:23:45.72
But kiddo, we all right, can we get some money for a new bike because the bike was

1341
01:23:45.72 --> 01:23:46.72
trashed.

1342
01:23:46.72 --> 01:23:51.12
Nowadays, that would be game over for that guy's whole life, right?

1343
01:23:51.12 --> 01:23:53.60
That'd be going to put, would you go to jail for that?

1344
01:23:53.60 --> 01:23:57.32
If you hit a kid on a bike while you're drunk, I would say like no question.

1345
01:23:57.32 --> 01:23:59.40
We'd be going jail, right?

1346
01:23:59.40 --> 01:24:04.28
So it's pretty interesting that way back then he's saying when combined with the operation

1347
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.92
of motor vehicle, it becomes a potential killer.

1348
01:24:05.92 --> 01:24:08.32
Yeah, he's way out in front of the curve here.

1349
01:24:08.32 --> 01:24:11.88
This is someone who's probably spent way more time thinking about that type of character

1350
01:24:11.88 --> 01:24:14.28
than others because back then that wasn't a thing.

1351
01:24:14.28 --> 01:24:18.44
Yeah, you want to know why he's probably gone to visit all of a bunch of guys in the

1352
01:24:18.44 --> 01:24:22.40
hospital that had drunk driving accidents and repaired, you know, had jeeps, had to write off

1353
01:24:22.40 --> 01:24:25.56
jeeps and trucks and whatever else.

1354
01:24:25.56 --> 01:24:29.24
These results are not only detrimental to the individual, but also to the service, particularly

1355
01:24:29.24 --> 01:24:32.60
in overseas commands, commanders at all levels must continually take aggressive action

1356
01:24:32.60 --> 01:24:37.44
who do successive drinking and prevent drunk and driving.

1357
01:24:37.44 --> 01:24:47.36
Long time ago, again, officers are expected to set the example.

1358
01:24:47.36 --> 01:24:52.40
The officer's code, Armyungi Regulation's provide that an officer's signature is in itself

1359
01:24:52.40 --> 01:24:54.04
a certification.

1360
01:24:54.04 --> 01:24:55.76
His signature is his bond.

1361
01:24:55.76 --> 01:25:02.32
A requirement is that an officer is so to conduct himself that he is deserving of such

1362
01:25:02.32 --> 01:25:04.32
trust.

1363
01:25:04.32 --> 01:25:07.84
The appropriate administrative and disciplinary action must be taken against officers who

1364
01:25:07.84 --> 01:25:11.92
are guilty of misconduct and unwilling to live within proper code.

1365
01:25:11.92 --> 01:25:16.24
The officer and officer cannot expect to retain his standing and prestige as an officer

1366
01:25:16.24 --> 01:25:21.24
where he is inefficient or guilty of becoming conduct.

1367
01:25:21.24 --> 01:25:26.88
Each officer must clothe himself with such a scale of values that he knows instinctively

1368
01:25:26.88 --> 01:25:31.48
the things that an officer does not do.

1369
01:25:31.48 --> 01:25:35.96
The officer's code does not get less binding as he goes up and rank.

1370
01:25:35.96 --> 01:25:37.40
The opposite is true.

1371
01:25:37.40 --> 01:25:40.40
It becomes more binding.

1372
01:25:40.40 --> 01:25:44.52
Dude, this dude is holding the line big time.

1373
01:25:44.52 --> 01:25:48.68
I'm feeling like nervous.

1374
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:56.76
As I always have to point out, I was a young wild frog man.

1375
01:25:56.76 --> 01:26:06.92
I did not come close to achieving these standards.

1376
01:26:06.92 --> 01:26:11.24
I would have loved to have read this book when I was 18, 19, 20.

1377
01:26:11.24 --> 01:26:17.68
I would have loved to have this people that were telling me, hey bro, this is the path.

1378
01:26:17.68 --> 01:26:18.68
This is it.

1379
01:26:18.68 --> 01:26:20.36
This is what you want to do.

1380
01:26:20.36 --> 01:26:21.36
And you know what?

1381
01:26:21.36 --> 01:26:22.36
It takes to be able to do that.

1382
01:26:22.36 --> 01:26:26.72
Here's the reality.

1383
01:26:26.72 --> 01:26:28.28
For me to say, hey, you know what?

1384
01:26:28.28 --> 01:26:31.60
I made mistakes and I do not want you to make them.

1385
01:26:31.60 --> 01:26:34.32
I want you to be better than me.

1386
01:26:34.32 --> 01:26:36.84
I want you to be better than I am.

1387
01:26:36.84 --> 01:26:40.92
I want you're the end state of your life.

1388
01:26:40.92 --> 01:26:45.60
I want to be superior to mine.

1389
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:49.28
That's what drives giving this kind of advice.

1390
01:26:49.28 --> 01:26:56.32
Hey, listen, I want the end state of your life to be superior to mine.

1391
01:26:56.32 --> 01:27:00.32
That's what we should be thinking when we interact with other people.

1392
01:27:00.32 --> 01:27:03.76
We shouldn't have that little thing in the back of our minds at saying, you know what?

1393
01:27:03.76 --> 01:27:05.04
I had to do this.

1394
01:27:05.04 --> 01:27:07.76
I had to learn the hard way.

1395
01:27:07.76 --> 01:27:10.000
I wish I would have done that, but I'd known told me to do that.

1396
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.48
Why should I tell him?

1397
01:27:14.48 --> 01:27:15.48
What do you got?

1398
01:27:15.48 --> 01:27:16.48
Just wrote it down.

1399
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:17.48
Because that's a good one.

1400
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:19.76
That's leadership.

1401
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:20.76
Yeah.

1402
01:27:20.76 --> 01:27:21.76
Yeah.

1403
01:27:21.76 --> 01:27:23.76
Crazy.

1404
01:27:23.76 --> 01:27:32.76
I was recently invited to the US Army Command and General Staff College to address the

1405
01:27:32.76 --> 01:27:37.000
faculty and students on the subject of command or ship and general ship.

1406
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.08
Following my talk, I was asked to comment on the problem of integrity versus professional

1407
01:27:41.08 --> 01:27:47.80
loyalty when an officer is confronted with orders with which he has a strong disagreement.

1408
01:27:47.80 --> 01:27:50.000
I answered by citing two examples of my experience.

1409
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.48
Once, while I could that, I asked a tactical officer a similar question.

1410
01:27:54.48 --> 01:27:59.92
His answer was to carry out the order loyally and then when you are in a tenable position

1411
01:27:59.92 --> 01:28:02.32
to recommend changes if warranted.

1412
01:28:02.32 --> 01:28:03.88
I have followed this with good results.

1413
01:28:03.88 --> 01:28:05.32
So there's your first answer.

1414
01:28:05.32 --> 01:28:08.64
Hey, you know, I asked Dave to do something that you don't agree with.

1415
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:10.04
What should you do?

1416
01:28:10.04 --> 01:28:12.000
Well, you should carry it out and then you should pull me aside.

1417
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.92
When you can soon get a chance to go, hey, General, this doesn't seem like it's a good idea.

1418
01:28:14.92 --> 01:28:16.32
Me here's why.

1419
01:28:16.32 --> 01:28:17.32
Good.

1420
01:28:17.32 --> 01:28:18.32
Got that.

1421
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:21.28
This is a longer example.

1422
01:28:21.28 --> 01:28:28.04
In another instance, when I was a commanding general of the US Continental Army Command, we

1423
01:28:28.04 --> 01:28:32.96
were charged with the service testing of an expensive and important piece of Army equipment.

1424
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:38.04
This was important enough to assign my deputy, a lieutenant general to monitor closely.

1425
01:28:38.04 --> 01:28:39.72
The test went on for several weeks.

1426
01:28:39.72 --> 01:28:43.44
One day, my deputy reported to me that the piece of equipment was not proving outside

1427
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:45.000
as factually.

1428
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.64
He was fully convinced of his position.

1429
01:28:47.64 --> 01:28:51.72
I told him how serious and how sensitive such a finding would be.

1430
01:28:51.72 --> 01:28:57.72
I directed that he called in several officers closely concerned with the test for a conference

1431
01:28:57.72 --> 01:28:58.72
with me.

1432
01:28:58.72 --> 01:29:02.28
This was done in all were unanimous supporting the position of my deputy.

1433
01:29:02.28 --> 01:29:04.68
They had beta and results supporting them.

1434
01:29:04.68 --> 01:29:06.28
So they're supposed to test his piece of gear.

1435
01:29:06.28 --> 01:29:08.72
There's a, it sounds like there's an expected outcome.

1436
01:29:08.72 --> 01:29:10.64
It wasn't turned out that way.

1437
01:29:10.64 --> 01:29:15.24
I directed that they prepare a personal letter for my signature.

1438
01:29:15.24 --> 01:29:19.84
The chief of staff of the army or for my signature for the chief of staff of the army

1439
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:25.72
setting forth their findings and conclusions with supporting data and information.

1440
01:29:25.72 --> 01:29:30.40
After proving and signing it, I had my aid delivered by hand to the chief of staff.

1441
01:29:30.40 --> 01:29:33.24
Within 48 hours, I had a phone call from the chief of staff.

1442
01:29:33.24 --> 01:29:34.96
He was disturbed.

1443
01:29:34.96 --> 01:29:37.32
He told me how serious this was.

1444
01:29:37.32 --> 01:29:42.08
How important the equipment was and how not only the United States, but an allied power

1445
01:29:42.08 --> 01:29:44.32
was interested in it.

1446
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:49.68
He wanted us to take a positive approach and proceed with the program.

1447
01:29:49.68 --> 01:29:51.16
My reply, so there you go.

1448
01:29:51.16 --> 01:29:53.24
He wrote, hey, there's the problems, these are the shortfalls.

1449
01:29:53.24 --> 01:29:54.48
That's what we all agree on.

1450
01:29:54.48 --> 01:29:56.36
I'm letting you know.

1451
01:29:56.36 --> 01:30:01.68
And his boss says, hey, this is an interesting terminology.

1452
01:30:01.68 --> 01:30:08.12
I want you to take a positive approach and proceed.

1453
01:30:08.12 --> 01:30:10.08
Take a positive approach and proceed.

1454
01:30:10.08 --> 01:30:17.92
So to me, I translate that as a lean towards making this work.

1455
01:30:17.92 --> 01:30:22.44
My reply was that I felt I owed him the loyalty to bring the facts as I believe them

1456
01:30:22.44 --> 01:30:28.92
to his attention and having done that, I was prepared to carry out fully his further instructions.

1457
01:30:28.92 --> 01:30:34.12
The morals of this true story are the chief of staff was in a position to, now this is important.

1458
01:30:34.12 --> 01:30:39.28
The chief of staff was in a position to know of considerations and factors of the

1459
01:30:39.28 --> 01:30:44.88
higher highest importance, which I could not know.

1460
01:30:44.88 --> 01:30:49.84
Now where I think this is, if Dave comes to me and says, hey, I object to this or I got

1461
01:30:49.84 --> 01:30:50.84
the issue.

1462
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:53.28
My response, hey, Dave, here's what's going on, man.

1463
01:30:53.28 --> 01:30:55.24
Here's why this is important, here's what's happening.

1464
01:30:55.24 --> 01:30:56.40
I would tell you why.

1465
01:30:56.40 --> 01:30:58.000
Here's some things you see that I don't see.

1466
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.36
Here's some things you know, I need to know.

1467
01:30:59.36 --> 01:31:00.36
Yep.

1468
01:31:00.36 --> 01:31:01.64
Yep.

1469
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:07.60
I had satisfied both my integrity and professional loyalty as well as my duty to my superior.

1470
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:11.92
I was now free to proceed without compromise on my part.

1471
01:31:11.92 --> 01:31:17.68
To take a negative or I told you so attitude would not have been becoming to a member

1472
01:31:17.68 --> 01:31:22.000
of the team, all members of which were dedicated to doing their best for the army and their

1473
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
country.

1474
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.08
So, I wrote about this in leadership strategy and tactics, almost that nausea.

1475
01:31:29.08 --> 01:31:31.84
But there's so many different ways to talk about it.

1476
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:40.000
And I even want that I cite all the time is the band of brothers, Dick Winters, totally.

1477
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yep.

1478
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
You do the recon.

1479
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Someone gets killed.

1480
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.72
The war is literally within days of ending.

1481
01:31:44.72 --> 01:31:45.72
You do a recon.

1482
01:31:45.72 --> 01:31:46.72
Someone gets killed.

1483
01:31:46.72 --> 01:31:47.72
You come back.

1484
01:31:47.72 --> 01:31:50.80
You get told to do another recon the next night and you say, got it boss.

1485
01:31:50.80 --> 01:31:54.96
And then you go have the guys drink wine and a seller and you don't do the recon.

1486
01:31:54.96 --> 01:31:56.96
Is that a good call?

1487
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:57.96
Yep.

1488
01:31:57.96 --> 01:31:59.96
Is it supporting the chain of command?

1489
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:00.96
Nope.

1490
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:01.96
Did it protect the guys?

1491
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:03.96
Yes, did it accomplish the mission?

1492
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:04.96
Yes.

1493
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:07.96
Could he have argued it a little bit and I forget from the movie what how they showed it?

1494
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:08.96
I think he pushed back.

1495
01:32:08.96 --> 01:32:10.64
He definitely pushed back.

1496
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:14.84
But a certain point pushing back would have just gotten fired and then guess what?

1497
01:32:14.84 --> 01:32:15.84
Then they're going on the patrol.

1498
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:17.28
Then they're going on the patrol with the Yes man.

1499
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:18.28
With the Yes man.

1500
01:32:18.28 --> 01:32:19.28
Yep.

1501
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:20.28
For sure.

1502
01:32:20.28 --> 01:32:23.60
And as you're building, as the story is building up, there's a little part of me too.

1503
01:32:23.60 --> 01:32:26.24
But I think a people listening like, so he's already done that.

1504
01:32:26.24 --> 01:32:28.72
He's going to now hold the line.

1505
01:32:28.72 --> 01:32:33.56
This or I cannot in good conscious put this in a positive light.

1506
01:32:33.56 --> 01:32:34.56
Cool.

1507
01:32:34.56 --> 01:32:36.64
I'll find somebody who can.

1508
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:39.76
And there's a part in there, the humility that it takes.

1509
01:32:39.76 --> 01:32:43.60
He's a four star general in this case to go, you know what?

1510
01:32:43.60 --> 01:32:44.60
The chief of staff knows something.

1511
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:45.60
I don't know.

1512
01:32:45.60 --> 01:32:46.88
He sees something I don't see.

1513
01:32:46.88 --> 01:32:49.96
Can I consider that and try to go out and go, hey, I tell you what.

1514
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:52.76
There's some place over who this piece of equipment actually does work pretty well.

1515
01:32:52.76 --> 01:32:53.76
Maybe not here or here.

1516
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:54.76
But here's some positive.

1517
01:32:54.76 --> 01:32:55.76
Can I do that?

1518
01:32:55.76 --> 01:32:56.92
Yeah, it takes a ton of humility.

1519
01:32:56.92 --> 01:33:01.32
But if you don't do that, the influence you lose to actually provide the outcome that

1520
01:33:01.32 --> 01:33:06.48
you want, which is exactly what you're saying, think about the humility it takes to go,

1521
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:09.04
maybe I don't have the whole picture.

1522
01:33:09.04 --> 01:33:12.04
And this, I'm going to dig my heels in a hole in the line because it's the right thing

1523
01:33:12.04 --> 01:33:13.04
to do.

1524
01:33:13.04 --> 01:33:14.32
Maybe I actually don't even know the whole story.

1525
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:15.32
Cool.

1526
01:33:15.32 --> 01:33:16.32
You're fired.

1527
01:33:16.32 --> 01:33:17.32
Right.

1528
01:33:17.32 --> 01:33:18.32
Yep.

1529
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:18.32
See you later.

1530
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:20.44
And I'll get a yes man in there and he's going to give me whatever I want for report.

1531
01:33:20.44 --> 01:33:21.44
And that's that.

1532
01:33:21.44 --> 01:33:22.44
Yeah.

1533
01:33:22.44 --> 01:33:24.08
So good.

1534
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:28.52
Next section.

1535
01:33:28.52 --> 01:33:33.16
And this is chapter four, prestige of the non-commissioned officer.

1536
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:37.32
And again, once again, I sort of said, well, maybe we don't need to cover this.

1537
01:33:37.32 --> 01:33:39.84
And then as I read through it, I realized what this is talking about.

1538
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:45.36
And this is talking about something that I've referred to quite a bit on EF online lately.

1539
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:50.96
So if you think about it from this perspective, it starts to make a lot of sense way beyond

1540
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:51.96
the military.

1541
01:33:51.96 --> 01:33:56.36
That is respect, respect.

1542
01:33:56.36 --> 01:33:58.32
So prestige of the non-commissioned officer.

1543
01:33:58.32 --> 01:34:02.76
So if you think about this from perspective of how do you respect people, how important

1544
01:34:02.76 --> 01:34:03.76
that is?

1545
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:05.56
Because that's what he's talking about.

1546
01:34:05.56 --> 01:34:09.60
Continuing on, advances in weapon systems over the past few years have forced many

1547
01:34:09.60 --> 01:34:13.16
changes in our tactile organization and operational concepts.

1548
01:34:13.16 --> 01:34:18.88
The keynotes of our modern army, our mobility, dispersion and small, small, and operations.

1549
01:34:18.88 --> 01:34:24.68
This concept coupled with the many new tools of war requires greater reliance than ever before

1550
01:34:24.68 --> 01:34:26.44
on our non-commissioned officers.

1551
01:34:26.44 --> 01:34:27.44
What do we talk about?

1552
01:34:27.44 --> 01:34:28.44
We're talking about front line leaders.

1553
01:34:28.44 --> 01:34:31.04
So if you're in civilian world, we're talking about front line leaders.

1554
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:32.04
And guess what?

1555
01:34:32.04 --> 01:34:36.28
This guy was in World War I and in World War I, there was not a bunch of reliance.

1556
01:34:36.28 --> 01:34:38.64
There was not dispersion, meaning everyone was together.

1557
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:43.32
You're in a big trench, you're all together when the trumpet blows or the whistle sounds

1558
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:45.32
or the signal comes.

1559
01:34:45.32 --> 01:34:46.32
We're all going at once.

1560
01:34:46.32 --> 01:34:47.32
We're going to go over the top.

1561
01:34:47.32 --> 01:34:48.84
We're going to charge.

1562
01:34:48.84 --> 01:34:53.48
And with hundreds and hundreds of men at the same time, there's no dispersion.

1563
01:34:53.48 --> 01:34:54.88
We're all close together.

1564
01:34:54.88 --> 01:34:57.12
It's not small unit operations.

1565
01:34:57.12 --> 01:34:58.12
And we're not moving.

1566
01:34:58.12 --> 01:34:59.12
So he saw that.

1567
01:34:59.12 --> 01:35:01.76
And we're, look, he says mobility, dispersion, and small unit operations.

1568
01:35:01.76 --> 01:35:02.92
What was World War I?

1569
01:35:02.92 --> 01:35:04.08
It was not mobile.

1570
01:35:04.08 --> 01:35:05.32
It was not dispersed.

1571
01:35:05.32 --> 01:35:07.48
And it was not small unit operations.

1572
01:35:07.48 --> 01:35:11.68
By the time he gets to Korea and then he gets to World War II or sorry World War II and then

1573
01:35:11.68 --> 01:35:12.84
Korea, it's totally different.

1574
01:35:12.84 --> 01:35:16.64
And now he realizes the importance of the front line leaders.

1575
01:35:16.64 --> 01:35:19.76
So how do we rely on these front line leaders?

1576
01:35:19.76 --> 01:35:23.44
So if you're thinking about your front line leaders, here's what you need to do.

1577
01:35:23.44 --> 01:35:27.56
Fully developed the non-commissioned officer to fulfill his role, a commander must place

1578
01:35:27.56 --> 01:35:32.96
with responsibility on him and permit him to assume his place in command.

1579
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:35.84
You have to give them ownership.

1580
01:35:35.84 --> 01:35:39.92
In doing this, standards of performance need not be lowered.

1581
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:46.08
Honest errors must be expected and tolerated but corrected.

1582
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:51.12
When your personnel must not use SERP responsibilities which provide the experience needed

1583
01:35:51.12 --> 01:35:53.68
in developing our junior leaders.

1584
01:35:53.68 --> 01:35:55.08
Don't be the Esman.

1585
01:35:55.08 --> 01:35:56.08
Don't be the easy button.

1586
01:35:56.08 --> 01:35:59.40
Sorry, don't be the easy button.

1587
01:35:59.40 --> 01:36:03.48
Emphasis should be placed on the non-commissioned officer's role.

1588
01:36:03.48 --> 01:36:08.28
Leader, trainer, supervisor.

1589
01:36:08.28 --> 01:36:09.28
Leader, trainer, supervisor.

1590
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:14.84
This goes back to the developing the echelon front certification program.

1591
01:36:14.84 --> 01:36:18.56
Think about this leader, trainer, supervisor.

1592
01:36:18.56 --> 01:36:21.16
He's got them all mixed in like we eventually got to.

1593
01:36:21.16 --> 01:36:23.60
I didn't have this book and we were starting to develop the program.

1594
01:36:23.60 --> 01:36:27.32
Now that I have it, I'm super stoked that we came to the same conclusion.

1595
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:31.60
And that is that a leader, a trainer, a supervisor, a manager and instructor.

1596
01:36:31.60 --> 01:36:35.72
They're all qualities that are needed as you come up the chain of command if you're going

1597
01:36:35.72 --> 01:36:39.08
to be in charge of people.

1598
01:36:39.08 --> 01:36:45.24
There follows a list of suggested actions that may be taken each by each commissioned officer

1599
01:36:45.24 --> 01:36:50.44
at all levels of command to further the efficiency and enhance the stature of the non-commissioned

1600
01:36:50.44 --> 01:36:52.64
officer corps.

1601
01:36:52.64 --> 01:36:55.40
Again, how do we respect our frontline leaders?

1602
01:36:55.40 --> 01:36:59.88
Because the more respect we give them, the more respect they're going to give us, the

1603
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:06.12
more ownership we give them, the more ownership they're going to take.

1604
01:37:06.12 --> 01:37:08.04
Affordy.

1605
01:37:08.04 --> 01:37:15.04
To prevent the use of non-commissioned officers for menial and degrading tasks.

1606
01:37:15.04 --> 01:37:16.20
Okay.

1607
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:20.56
Ensure that non-commissioned officers are consistently addressed by their rank.

1608
01:37:20.56 --> 01:37:24.76
So you're giving them that respect.

1609
01:37:24.76 --> 01:37:27.92
At here to the chain of command through non-commissioned officer ranks, right?

1610
01:37:27.92 --> 01:37:31.72
So you don't jump down to the front line and start talking them without talking to that

1611
01:37:31.72 --> 01:37:34.92
front line leader.

1612
01:37:34.92 --> 01:37:40.36
Use requirements for officer supervision or mandatory presence at troop formations.

1613
01:37:40.36 --> 01:37:42.48
Let the non-commissioned officer take charge.

1614
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:46.60
Give them ownership.

1615
01:37:46.60 --> 01:37:50.48
Sometimes for those of you that don't watch the Sun YouTube, when Dave just fully agrees

1616
01:37:50.48 --> 01:37:53.28
with something, he doesn't not as head-yes.

1617
01:37:53.28 --> 01:37:54.72
He shakes his head no.

1618
01:37:54.72 --> 01:37:59.56
As if to say this is just no disputing this at all.

1619
01:37:59.56 --> 01:38:03.76
Avoid mass withdrawal of non-commissioned officer privileges but take positive action against

1620
01:38:03.76 --> 01:38:08.20
individual concerns so don't do collective punitive actions.

1621
01:38:08.20 --> 01:38:13.52
When appropriate, permit key non-commissioned officers to attend staff conferences and commanders

1622
01:38:13.52 --> 01:38:14.52
briefings.

1623
01:38:14.52 --> 01:38:15.52
Hello.

1624
01:38:15.52 --> 01:38:20.48
Take that front line leader, bring him into your higher level meetings, let them see what's

1625
01:38:20.48 --> 01:38:23.60
going on.

1626
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:28.60
Ensure that deserving high-quality non-commissioned officers are commended for outstanding

1627
01:38:28.60 --> 01:38:34.08
performance of duty by awarding them, combination ribbons, letters of appreciation or

1628
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:39.36
commendation or certificates of achievement or, and this is Jocco's edition, give them

1629
01:38:39.36 --> 01:38:44.04
more responsibility, give them more ownership.

1630
01:38:44.04 --> 01:38:51.88
Refrain from over supervising the non-commissioned officer after a task has been assigned.

1631
01:38:51.88 --> 01:38:59.60
No micromanage, issue mission type instructions rather than detailed orders.

1632
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:04.08
I haven't said that yet on this podcast but when I read these things, I feel like I

1633
01:39:04.08 --> 01:39:06.60
owe this guy money.

1634
01:39:06.60 --> 01:39:09.88
Whenever possible, place senior non-commissioned officers under the supervision of Commissioner

1635
01:39:09.88 --> 01:39:14.88
War Officers, inform non-commissioned officers in advance of significant matters pertaining

1636
01:39:14.88 --> 01:39:18.88
to the units such as maneuvers, field problems, training requirements, disciplinary matters,

1637
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:23.48
standards to avoid unfounded rumors and allow for necessary advance planning at all

1638
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:26.08
echelons.

1639
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:28.76
Does it make sense that you keep your unit informed?

1640
01:39:28.76 --> 01:39:33.60
You keep your front line leaders informed?

1641
01:39:33.60 --> 01:39:35.68
What do you think they do when you don't tell them what's happening?

1642
01:39:35.68 --> 01:39:39.80
Do you think they just sit there and silently wait a wait your word?

1643
01:39:39.80 --> 01:39:40.80
No, they make shit up.

1644
01:39:40.80 --> 01:39:45.92
Make it up, yep.

1645
01:39:45.92 --> 01:39:46.92
Is there more?

1646
01:39:46.92 --> 01:39:49.20
This is ridiculous how good this is.

1647
01:39:49.20 --> 01:39:50.84
Grant, non-commissioned officers.

1648
01:39:50.84 --> 01:39:53.92
Again, if you're listening to this and you're not in the military, just replace this with

1649
01:39:53.92 --> 01:39:55.80
your front line leaders.

1650
01:39:55.80 --> 01:40:00.60
Grant, front line leaders, a greater voice in allowing privileges or awards or warning

1651
01:40:00.60 --> 01:40:02.72
punishment.

1652
01:40:02.72 --> 01:40:10.44
Consult with them on matters involving the reclassification and promotion of their subordinates.

1653
01:40:10.44 --> 01:40:13.04
Let it be known that they greatly influence these matters.

1654
01:40:13.04 --> 01:40:19.16
This whole thing is about giving way of responsibility and giving way of ownership.

1655
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:25.24
Use senior non-commission officers to assist in conducting inspections and ensure distribution

1656
01:40:25.24 --> 01:40:30.80
of directives to non-commission officers so that they may have current information on military

1657
01:40:30.80 --> 01:40:32.44
matters.

1658
01:40:32.44 --> 01:40:39.60
Keep your front line leaders informed.

1659
01:40:39.60 --> 01:40:47.36
Use senior non-commission officers as instructors, back the actions of non-commission officers

1660
01:40:47.36 --> 01:40:53.64
publicly refer to them as non-commission officers, not as NCOs or non-comps, which are two

1661
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:55.64
slang terms which I do all the time.

1662
01:40:55.64 --> 01:40:57.48
NCOs, non-comps.

1663
01:40:57.48 --> 01:41:01.84
He's saying, give them that and look, it's a little slang term.

1664
01:41:01.84 --> 01:41:03.84
Give them that respect.

1665
01:41:03.84 --> 01:41:07.48
Yeah, the title is, is the prestige of the non-commission officer.

1666
01:41:07.48 --> 01:41:09.48
I mean, that's what he's talking about.

1667
01:41:09.48 --> 01:41:16.60
I mean, that was just a recipe for leadership right there and like I said, these are your supervisors.

1668
01:41:16.60 --> 01:41:20.68
These are your front line supervisors whose management is of the people right at the point

1669
01:41:20.68 --> 01:41:23.20
of friction, the ones doing the work.

1670
01:41:23.20 --> 01:41:27.28
So these are your first line supervisors and second line supervisors closest to your people

1671
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:29.44
out there making it happen.

1672
01:41:29.44 --> 01:41:34.76
And if you want them to respect you, you gotta give them respect.

1673
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:37.36
If you want them to trust you, you have to trust them.

1674
01:41:37.36 --> 01:41:44.36
And if you want them to lead, like you gotta let them lead in every single time, you take

1675
01:41:44.36 --> 01:41:46.08
responsibility away from them.

1676
01:41:46.08 --> 01:41:50.24
He said in the beginning, you gotta expect them to make mistakes and make errors.

1677
01:41:50.24 --> 01:41:51.76
You don't ignore it.

1678
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:52.76
You correct it.

1679
01:41:52.76 --> 01:41:54.40
But you don't take responsibility away from them.

1680
01:41:54.40 --> 01:41:58.20
If I take, if you do something that's not what I want, you work for me, you're one

1681
01:41:58.20 --> 01:41:59.20
of my supervisors.

1682
01:41:59.20 --> 01:42:01.20
You go out there and do something that's not how I wanted it.

1683
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:05.60
And if I take that responsibility away from you, that's me telling you, I don't trust

1684
01:42:05.60 --> 01:42:06.60
you.

1685
01:42:06.60 --> 01:42:11.08
So with the return on me again, that is, you don't trust me as much.

1686
01:42:11.08 --> 01:42:12.24
That means I still gotta correct that.

1687
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:13.24
I gotta show you.

1688
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:14.04
Hey, Jockel, that's not what we're looking for.

1689
01:42:14.04 --> 01:42:15.84
Let me talk you about why we did this in a while.

1690
01:42:15.84 --> 01:42:16.84
Let me explain these things.

1691
01:42:16.84 --> 01:42:18.96
But I get you right back out there to go do it.

1692
01:42:18.96 --> 01:42:23.16
The reciprocal nature of the relationship, everything you want from them, you have to give

1693
01:42:23.16 --> 01:42:25.52
them that it was literally a list.

1694
01:42:25.52 --> 01:42:30.32
It is a checklist of leadership to get the behavior that you want.

1695
01:42:30.32 --> 01:42:36.96
You and I were on a call with one of our clients the other day and it was, it was one

1696
01:42:36.96 --> 01:42:40.16
of those questions came up and there's these four things.

1697
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:41.16
It's a call.

1698
01:42:41.16 --> 01:42:43.88
Chris, he was on the call and she was quite fired up.

1699
01:42:43.88 --> 01:42:44.88
She's awesome.

1700
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:45.88
She absolutely.

1701
01:42:45.88 --> 01:42:49.64
But if you want people to listen to you, listen to them.

1702
01:42:49.64 --> 01:42:51.76
If you want people to respect them, respect them.

1703
01:42:51.76 --> 01:42:54.80
If you want people to respect you, you have to respect them.

1704
01:42:54.80 --> 01:43:00.28
If you want to influence people, you have to allow them to influence you.

1705
01:43:00.28 --> 01:43:07.08
And if you want people to trust you, you have to give them trust.

1706
01:43:07.08 --> 01:43:10.20
Couple more things on this section, responsibilities.

1707
01:43:10.20 --> 01:43:13.76
Insist on a thorough appreciation of the non-commissioned officers full-time responsibility

1708
01:43:13.76 --> 01:43:18.20
to his men and to his commander.

1709
01:43:18.20 --> 01:43:21.60
Theral appreciation.

1710
01:43:21.60 --> 01:43:22.60
What does that mean?

1711
01:43:22.60 --> 01:43:23.60
That means respect.

1712
01:43:23.60 --> 01:43:28.28
A point senior non-commissioned officer counsels at each level of command starting with

1713
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:29.28
the batined separate.

1714
01:43:29.28 --> 01:43:33.68
So again, this idea of creating these councils, these groups within your organization,

1715
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:36.96
so you can get good feedback as brilliant.

1716
01:43:36.96 --> 01:43:40.52
Encourage non-commissioned officers, officer participation in civic affairs.

1717
01:43:40.52 --> 01:43:41.52
Great.

1718
01:43:41.52 --> 01:43:43.20
The last section here is education and training.

1719
01:43:43.20 --> 01:43:47.28
This is the last thing we're going to cover.

1720
01:43:47.28 --> 01:43:50.40
Nothing can close with prestige.

1721
01:43:50.40 --> 01:43:55.88
A non-commissioned officer who does not know his job and does not play the part expected

1722
01:43:55.88 --> 01:43:58.52
of him as a non-commissioned officer.

1723
01:43:58.52 --> 01:44:01.68
Because of that, we should.

1724
01:44:01.68 --> 01:44:06.36
One, hold classes to ensure that non-commissioned officers are thoroughly trained for their

1725
01:44:06.36 --> 01:44:12.60
jobs and prepared to handle instructions or duties when they appear before their subordinates.

1726
01:44:12.60 --> 01:44:14.08
What is that right there?

1727
01:44:14.08 --> 01:44:18.000
Look, I am responsible for making sure that people below me in the chain of command are

1728
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.28
right or do their job totally.

1729
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:25.96
Number two, encourage attendance at non-commissioned officers academy and other courses

1730
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:33.44
designed to enhance the prestige and set the standards expected of non-commissioned officers

1731
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:38.64
and three encourage non-commissioned officers to take advantage of the many opportunities to increase

1732
01:44:38.64 --> 01:44:44.52
their general level of education.

1733
01:44:44.52 --> 01:44:48.28
And what's just amazing about this?

1734
01:44:48.28 --> 01:44:53.20
That's just another 13 pages of this document, which is 117 pages long.

1735
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:57.76
We made it through another, I think we might have made it through 14 pages.

1736
01:44:57.76 --> 01:45:02.60
But the section that closes out is to treat people with respect and give them responsibility

1737
01:45:02.60 --> 01:45:07.72
and train them and educate them.

1738
01:45:07.72 --> 01:45:09.20
To take care of your people.

1739
01:45:09.20 --> 01:45:11.76
Now let's point this out.

1740
01:45:11.76 --> 01:45:15.88
I don't care how good of a leader you are.

1741
01:45:15.88 --> 01:45:19.76
If you don't invest in these subordinates, it doesn't matter what you do.

1742
01:45:19.76 --> 01:45:27.000
Those front line leaders are the ones that win.

1743
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.24
They're also the ones that lose.

1744
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:32.000
So invest in them.

1745
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.48
Treat them with respect.

1746
01:45:33.48 --> 01:45:35.28
Listen to them.

1747
01:45:35.28 --> 01:45:38.32
Allow them to influence you.

1748
01:45:38.32 --> 01:45:42.88
Give them trust.

1749
01:45:42.88 --> 01:45:47.56
And I don't care what your job is or what your vocation is in life.

1750
01:45:47.56 --> 01:45:50.000
You have to work with people.

1751
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.72
Take care of those people and those people are going to take care of you.

1752
01:45:55.72 --> 01:46:04.64
And speaking of taking care of people, Dave, I know that you know that when the aircraft

1753
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:09.64
cabin loses pressure, the oxygen masks drop down.

1754
01:46:09.64 --> 01:46:12.20
And you have to take care of others.

1755
01:46:12.20 --> 01:46:13.20
Of course.

1756
01:46:13.20 --> 01:46:16.08
But before you take care of others, you have to take care of yourself to make sure that you

1757
01:46:16.08 --> 01:46:23.72
have enough oxygen to live so that you can then put the oxygen masks on your children.

1758
01:46:23.72 --> 01:46:27.12
So even though we need to take care of others and we need to take care of ourselves.

1759
01:46:27.12 --> 01:46:30.16
First we got some ways of doing that.

1760
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:34.36
One of the ways is Jaco fuel, which is supplements.

1761
01:46:34.36 --> 01:46:35.36
We got a bunch of them.

1762
01:46:35.36 --> 01:46:37.80
We got joint warfare, acrylic oil.

1763
01:46:37.80 --> 01:46:39.04
We got discipline, discipline, go.

1764
01:46:39.04 --> 01:46:40.04
We got discipline with the cans.

1765
01:46:40.04 --> 01:46:41.60
Are you on number two right now?

1766
01:46:41.60 --> 01:46:42.60
Number two.

1767
01:46:42.60 --> 01:46:44.56
What flavors have you torn to today?

1768
01:46:44.56 --> 01:46:47.64
Tax average, Jaco Palmer.

1769
01:46:47.64 --> 01:46:48.64
What's the preference?

1770
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:52.20
That doesn't actually count the one I had earlier today.

1771
01:46:52.20 --> 01:46:53.20
For my get.

1772
01:46:53.20 --> 01:46:55.92
So I guess I'm one number three.

1773
01:46:55.92 --> 01:47:00.96
We got vitamin D, D3, Cold War.

1774
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:03.84
Look, there's all kinds of diseases out there.

1775
01:47:03.84 --> 01:47:05.44
I'm not making any claims.

1776
01:47:05.44 --> 01:47:09.48
But some of us haven't caught those diseases.

1777
01:47:09.48 --> 01:47:10.96
So yeah, check that out.

1778
01:47:10.96 --> 01:47:15.60
Walk or your kid, walk, adult, which is just dessert.

1779
01:47:15.60 --> 01:47:22.40
We got, oh wait, we got a new flavor coming.

1780
01:47:22.40 --> 01:47:25.64
It's so good.

1781
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:29.60
It says like allegedly we're doing it seasonal, but this thing ain't going to be seasonal.

1782
01:47:29.60 --> 01:47:31.04
This thing is going to be all the time.

1783
01:47:31.04 --> 01:47:32.96
It's smashing pumpkin.

1784
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:40.92
And I don't even know, look, I don't even know what pumpkin things are.

1785
01:47:40.92 --> 01:47:44.76
Are supposed to taste like or whatever.

1786
01:47:44.76 --> 01:47:46.64
But damn, this thing is good.

1787
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:47.64
It's so good.

1788
01:47:47.64 --> 01:47:48.84
It's like a pumpkin.

1789
01:47:48.84 --> 01:47:50.40
The original B little sent me.

1790
01:47:50.40 --> 01:47:54.60
It was the generic name, the flavor name.

1791
01:47:54.60 --> 01:47:57.08
It was pumpkin spice.

1792
01:47:57.08 --> 01:48:01.68
And so I don't even know, I mean, you don't really eat pumpkin.

1793
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:02.68
Walk, right?

1794
01:48:02.68 --> 01:48:03.48
I mean, there's a pumpkin pie.

1795
01:48:03.48 --> 01:48:04.84
I get it.

1796
01:48:04.84 --> 01:48:08.24
But you're not sitting around, you know, going to the store grab and a piece of pumpkin

1797
01:48:08.24 --> 01:48:09.24
and eating it.

1798
01:48:09.24 --> 01:48:10.24
That's not happening.

1799
01:48:10.24 --> 01:48:11.24
Not not my house.

1800
01:48:11.24 --> 01:48:12.24
OK.

1801
01:48:12.24 --> 01:48:13.24
Negative.

1802
01:48:13.24 --> 01:48:18.28
So you're not even really a hundred percent sure what pumpkin flavor is.

1803
01:48:18.28 --> 01:48:19.28
Are you?

1804
01:48:19.28 --> 01:48:24.32
Is anyone the only thing I think of as pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving maybe, but to be honest

1805
01:48:24.32 --> 01:48:26.80
with you?

1806
01:48:26.80 --> 01:48:30.68
So I don't even know what we're doing, but all I know is we created something that's

1807
01:48:30.68 --> 01:48:31.68
a freaking tasty.

1808
01:48:31.68 --> 01:48:37.44
It's got like a, I guess if you ever had egg nog before, yeah.

1809
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:41.60
It's sort of an egg nog cinnamon scenario.

1810
01:48:41.60 --> 01:48:43.52
Sweet, just monk fruit, but it's so good.

1811
01:48:43.52 --> 01:48:44.52
Anyways, we got that.

1812
01:48:44.52 --> 01:48:45.72
We got that going on.

1813
01:48:45.72 --> 01:48:46.72
All this stuff.

1814
01:48:46.72 --> 01:48:50.64
We got chocolate, vitamin shop.

1815
01:48:50.64 --> 01:48:52.52
You can get all this stuff at the vitamin shop.

1816
01:48:52.52 --> 01:48:58.92
Also, if you're in Florida right now, you can get this stuff at Wawa.

1817
01:48:58.92 --> 01:49:01.44
Coming soon, hopefully, to all Wawa's.

1818
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:06.52
If you're in Florida, and you want to just kind of just fall on support the cause,

1819
01:49:06.52 --> 01:49:07.36
great.

1820
01:49:07.36 --> 01:49:09.64
There's a good way to support the cause.

1821
01:49:09.64 --> 01:49:13.48
Go in there and just clean them out.

1822
01:49:13.48 --> 01:49:16.000
Go get your Wawa on.

1823
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.88
Also, you can get this stuff at originmain.com.

1824
01:49:17.88 --> 01:49:18.88
What do I miss?

1825
01:49:18.88 --> 01:49:19.88
I miss anything?

1826
01:49:19.88 --> 01:49:20.88
Nope.

1827
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:21.88
I'm on board with all that.

1828
01:49:21.88 --> 01:49:24.96
I'll be, I'm actually excited about that new milk.

1829
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:29.24
Nobody has knocked strawberry off the top of the platform.

1830
01:49:29.24 --> 01:49:30.24
That is still remain.

1831
01:49:30.24 --> 01:49:31.24
So is your number two?

1832
01:49:31.24 --> 01:49:32.24
I go to.

1833
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:37.04
Hey, speaking of speaking of discipline go in the can of what you've had, too.

1834
01:49:37.04 --> 01:49:38.04
Three.

1835
01:49:38.04 --> 01:49:39.84
Three.

1836
01:49:39.84 --> 01:49:41.92
What flavor do you have earlier today?

1837
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:45.48
I had, oh, I had a second, jockel Palmer.

1838
01:49:45.48 --> 01:49:46.48
Okay.

1839
01:49:46.48 --> 01:49:47.48
Is that your kind of go through?

1840
01:49:47.48 --> 01:49:49.96
No, I'll be honest with you.

1841
01:49:49.96 --> 01:49:51.20
I drink all of them.

1842
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:53.80
I don't even look for flavors and more recent in the game.

1843
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:55.20
Dude, I'm just in the game.

1844
01:49:55.20 --> 01:50:00.000
There is not one that I can't just be totally stoked to be drinking.

1845
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.64
No, will there be one in the future that you'll be more stoked to be drinking?

1846
01:50:03.64 --> 01:50:06.40
No, yeah, I think there might be.

1847
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:07.40
So tell us.

1848
01:50:07.40 --> 01:50:11.56
So let's talk to us afterburner or just coming out afterburner or yeah.

1849
01:50:11.56 --> 01:50:18.64
Dave Burke is getting his own signature flavor.

1850
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:23.98
It's so crazy to think that I'm getting my own signature flavor of a product that I

1851
01:50:23.98 --> 01:50:26.92
actually already love anyway.

1852
01:50:26.92 --> 01:50:28.32
But I'll be honest with you.

1853
01:50:28.32 --> 01:50:35.36
When Pete and Brian at the team like, hey, bro, we would love to have you be part of this.

1854
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:40.64
I immediately went to my all time favorite soft drink, which I don't drink anymore,

1855
01:50:40.64 --> 01:50:45.44
which is orange, crush or orange soda, whatever that was back when we were kids.

1856
01:50:45.44 --> 01:50:49.44
I don't drink it, but I'll tell you, it's the best thing I've ever, I mean, as I can.

1857
01:50:49.44 --> 01:50:52.44
You're saying you don't drink anymore because you're just not going to sit around drinking.

1858
01:50:52.44 --> 01:50:53.44
Dude, I don't drink soda.

1859
01:50:53.44 --> 01:50:54.68
Yeah, I don't sit around drinking orange juice.

1860
01:50:54.68 --> 01:50:57.20
You're a human.

1861
01:50:57.20 --> 01:51:02.40
But you don't want to have conduct unbecoming when all's just saying, I'm sucking down sugar.

1862
01:51:02.40 --> 01:51:03.68
Negative.

1863
01:51:03.68 --> 01:51:07.56
But I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I don't miss that flavor big time.

1864
01:51:07.56 --> 01:51:08.76
So they were like, hey, what do you think?

1865
01:51:08.76 --> 01:51:11.60
And it was immediate like, bro, or I love orange.

1866
01:51:11.60 --> 01:51:15.84
And then that connection after a mirror was so easy, because who thought of after a mirror

1867
01:51:15.84 --> 01:51:17.32
orange?

1868
01:51:17.32 --> 01:51:18.88
I think it was me.

1869
01:51:18.88 --> 01:51:19.88
I really do.

1870
01:51:19.88 --> 01:51:20.88
Cool.

1871
01:51:20.88 --> 01:51:21.88
Yeah, cool.

1872
01:51:21.88 --> 01:51:22.88
And of course, they designed it.

1873
01:51:22.88 --> 01:51:24.96
Wait, did you have it going into the conversation did you have it?

1874
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:29.84
Well, kind of like they had mentioned, hey, I think the thing was like, hey, think about

1875
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:30.84
it.

1876
01:51:30.84 --> 01:51:31.84
It'd be cool to do something.

1877
01:51:31.84 --> 01:51:34.40
The relationship with Scott Floddard.

1878
01:51:34.40 --> 01:51:35.40
No.

1879
01:51:35.40 --> 01:51:36.40
Just that was it.

1880
01:51:36.40 --> 01:51:37.40
It was.

1881
01:51:37.40 --> 01:51:38.72
Hey, you should do one.

1882
01:51:38.72 --> 01:51:39.72
I thought about it.

1883
01:51:39.72 --> 01:51:40.92
I said, hey, what do you think of this?

1884
01:51:40.92 --> 01:51:42.56
And people's like, done, we're executing.

1885
01:51:42.56 --> 01:51:46.08
And then Brian executed and it happened and it was totally good to go.

1886
01:51:46.08 --> 01:51:47.60
Would you know when the release date is?

1887
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:49.24
I think it's like in the next month.

1888
01:51:49.24 --> 01:51:50.24
I think it's next month.

1889
01:51:50.24 --> 01:51:51.24
I think it's even.

1890
01:51:51.24 --> 01:51:52.24
Wait, what month?

1891
01:51:52.24 --> 01:51:53.24
No member.

1892
01:51:53.24 --> 01:51:54.24
So it's coming out November.

1893
01:51:54.24 --> 01:51:55.24
I think so.

1894
01:51:55.24 --> 01:51:56.24
After burner orange, yes.

1895
01:51:56.24 --> 01:51:59.64
The Dave Burke signature signature drink.

1896
01:51:59.64 --> 01:52:00.64
Yeah.

1897
01:52:00.64 --> 01:52:01.64
I'm playing on it.

1898
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:03.04
What kind of plane did they put on it?

1899
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:04.44
NF 35, silhouette.

1900
01:52:04.44 --> 01:52:05.44
Oh, dang.

1901
01:52:05.44 --> 01:52:06.44
Did you influence that?

1902
01:52:06.44 --> 01:52:07.44
Maybe.

1903
01:52:07.44 --> 01:52:12.04
She might have made sure it was the Marine Corps variant.

1904
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:13.44
Oh, damn.

1905
01:52:13.44 --> 01:52:14.44
Layers.

1906
01:52:14.44 --> 01:52:15.92
In the business, we call those layers.

1907
01:52:15.92 --> 01:52:16.92
Absolutely.

1908
01:52:16.92 --> 01:52:17.92
Dang.

1909
01:52:17.92 --> 01:52:23.44
Even though when you were a charge, when you were a squadron commander, was that

1910
01:52:23.44 --> 01:52:24.44
a Marine Corps squadron?

1911
01:52:24.44 --> 01:52:25.44
Yes.

1912
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:28.04
I was a Marine Corps squadron with the Marine Corps variant of the plane.

1913
01:52:28.04 --> 01:52:29.44
What did you do with the Air Force?

1914
01:52:29.44 --> 01:52:31.40
You take over to Air Force squadron at some point.

1915
01:52:31.40 --> 01:52:33.04
Air Force Division.

1916
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:34.24
That was the F-22 Raptor.

1917
01:52:34.24 --> 01:52:36.76
That was a straight up Air Force Unit Air Force aircraft.

1918
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:39.52
I was a Marine in an Air Force squadron.

1919
01:52:39.52 --> 01:52:42.20
Inside that squadron had a division of all these different airplanes.

1920
01:52:42.20 --> 01:52:45.36
One was the Raptor Division and that's where I operated.

1921
01:52:45.36 --> 01:52:46.36
Dang.

1922
01:52:46.36 --> 01:52:47.36
Yeah.

1923
01:52:47.36 --> 01:52:48.36
Check.

1924
01:52:48.36 --> 01:52:49.36
All right.

1925
01:52:49.36 --> 01:52:52.40
So we got all these cool drinks and they're good for you.

1926
01:52:52.40 --> 01:52:55.80
Which I know it doesn't make sense because people don't understand how it can happen.

1927
01:52:55.80 --> 01:52:57.08
I'll tell you how it can happen.

1928
01:52:57.08 --> 01:52:58.92
You don't cut corners.

1929
01:52:58.92 --> 01:53:07.28
You maintain the screw me on your product to make sure that it's not junk.

1930
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:09.56
So like I said, vitamin shop, originmain.com.

1931
01:53:09.56 --> 01:53:12.68
You can get them and wall-wall.

1932
01:53:12.68 --> 01:53:17.08
Soon to be worldwide.

1933
01:53:17.08 --> 01:53:21.16
Also if you want to get your gear, you're going to need your gear because you want

1934
01:53:21.16 --> 01:53:23.40
to train your gear because it's going to free your mind.

1935
01:53:23.40 --> 01:53:25.12
It is going to free your mind.

1936
01:53:25.12 --> 01:53:26.24
Go to originmain.com.

1937
01:53:26.24 --> 01:53:28.44
You can get these rash guards.

1938
01:53:28.44 --> 01:53:36.76
You can also get shorts, t-shirts, joggers and guess what just went back in the production.

1939
01:53:36.76 --> 01:53:37.76
Do you know Dave?

1940
01:53:37.76 --> 01:53:38.76
I don't.

1941
01:53:38.76 --> 01:53:43.04
Oh, little something called Delta jeans and I'll tell you what.

1942
01:53:43.04 --> 01:53:45.04
They're freaking savage.

1943
01:53:45.04 --> 01:53:49.36
I said one time and Pete got a big, what is it?

1944
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:52.40
A chuckle out of this.

1945
01:53:52.40 --> 01:53:53.40
Which you can picture.

1946
01:53:53.40 --> 01:53:54.40
Pete chuckling, right?

1947
01:53:54.40 --> 01:53:56.08
He's kind of a chuckler.

1948
01:53:56.08 --> 01:54:01.76
He was chuckling when I said that Delta jeans are the greatest thing that I've ever put

1949
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:05.76
on my legs.

1950
01:54:05.76 --> 01:54:07.76
And yeah, so check out that.

1951
01:54:07.76 --> 01:54:09.84
We got boots there.

1952
01:54:09.84 --> 01:54:10.84
All that stuff's available.

1953
01:54:10.84 --> 01:54:13.60
It's all made in America and that is what we're doing.

1954
01:54:13.60 --> 01:54:16.32
We're bringing manufacturing back to America.

1955
01:54:16.32 --> 01:54:17.32
That is what we're doing.

1956
01:54:17.32 --> 01:54:18.72
Go to originmain.com for that.

1957
01:54:18.72 --> 01:54:22.92
We also have another store which echo named Jockel's store.

1958
01:54:22.92 --> 01:54:24.92
Did I go name it that?

1959
01:54:24.92 --> 01:54:25.92
Yes, he did.

1960
01:54:25.92 --> 01:54:27.48
He legitimately did.

1961
01:54:27.48 --> 01:54:30.56
I guess Sarah was going to take the hit on the lack of creativity.

1962
01:54:30.56 --> 01:54:34.48
But I'm going to say echo is definitely involved in making Jockel's store.

1963
01:54:34.48 --> 01:54:35.48
Jockel's store.com.

1964
01:54:35.48 --> 01:54:38.68
We got Raskart's T-shirts, hats, beanies, all that kind of stuff.

1965
01:54:38.68 --> 01:54:40.32
We got Warrior Kids soap there.

1966
01:54:40.32 --> 01:54:41.32
So you can stay clean.

1967
01:54:41.32 --> 01:54:44.04
So check out Jockel's store.com.

1968
01:54:44.04 --> 01:54:47.36

1971
01:54:53.52 --> 01:54:56.28
I also have some other podcasts.

1972
01:54:56.28 --> 01:55:01.000
One's called unraveling, Jockel unraveling with Darrell Cooper.

1973
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.64
Another one's called the debrief podcast.

1974
01:55:02.64 --> 01:55:04.72
We're just still on this thread for now.

1975
01:55:04.72 --> 01:55:07.76
But we talk about just pure leadership.

1976
01:55:07.76 --> 01:55:08.76
It's a little shorter.

1977
01:55:08.76 --> 01:55:11.88
We try and make it a little bit more concise because we know leaders are out there working.

1978
01:55:11.88 --> 01:55:15.56
You don't always have time for a three hour podcast.

1979
01:55:15.56 --> 01:55:16.88
Grounded podcast.

1980
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:18.04
Warrior Kids podcast.

1981
01:55:18.04 --> 01:55:23.48
We have a YouTube channel where you can check out to see echoes.

1982
01:55:23.48 --> 01:55:30.28
Videos that he makes where he puts just a ridiculous amount of fire and explosions.

1983
01:55:30.28 --> 01:55:31.28
He's not here to defend himself.

1984
01:55:31.28 --> 01:55:34.60
This is boring.

1985
01:55:34.60 --> 01:55:37.000
YouTube channel.

1986
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Psychological warfare, album tracks, MP3.

1987
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.60
Flipsidecam is.com to go to my making cool stuff to hang on your wall.

1988
01:55:44.60 --> 01:55:48.88
Got a bunch of books about face, the thread that leads to this book that we're talking

1989
01:55:48.88 --> 01:55:49.88
about today about face.

1990
01:55:49.88 --> 01:55:51.80
I wrote the forward to the newest version.

1991
01:55:51.80 --> 01:55:56.20
You can check that out also the code the evaluation protocol written by Dave Burke and me

1992
01:55:56.20 --> 01:55:59.04

The answer to all the questions.

1996
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:08.04
Yeah, leadership strategy and tactics field manual.

1997
01:56:08.04 --> 01:56:11.16

1999
01:56:13.36 --> 01:56:14.36

Available for pre-order right now.

2001
01:56:16.36 --> 01:56:17.84
Hey, guess what?

2002
01:56:17.84 --> 01:56:24.52
I used to make fun of my publisher and say they're scared about ordering too many books.

2003
01:56:24.52 --> 01:56:25.60
They don't know how many books to order.

2004
01:56:25.60 --> 01:56:32.16
I'm telling them if you pre-order this, it lets me know how many books to order because

2005
01:56:32.16 --> 01:56:36.08
this is hard to sit on a bunch of books.

2006
01:56:36.08 --> 01:56:38.20
I want to produce the amount that I need.

2007
01:56:38.20 --> 01:56:43.000
I don't want anyone to get Christmas to come and you got no way to work it for.

2008
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.48
Field manual.

2009
01:56:45.48 --> 01:56:48.76
So pre-order that if you want, mic in the dragon to get some of that.

2010
01:56:48.76 --> 01:56:51.20
This one is freedom field manual and brand new versions out.

2011
01:56:51.20 --> 01:56:54.20
Got a bigger picture of my head on the cover.

2012
01:56:54.20 --> 01:56:55.76
Oh, we want to make it.

2013
01:56:55.76 --> 01:56:57.000
We want to make a new version.

2014
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
We want to be better.

2015
01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Oh, what should we do?

2016
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.60
Make the picture of my head bigger.

2017
01:57:00.60 --> 01:57:07.64
Is that supposed to make it better on what they're thinking?

2018
01:57:07.64 --> 01:57:11.48
Also extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership.

2019
01:57:11.48 --> 01:57:15.92
The OG books check those out.

2020
01:57:15.92 --> 01:57:16.92

01:58:04.08 --> 01:58:05.44
There's immediate ax drills.

2041
01:58:05.44 --> 01:58:06.44
There's questions.

2042
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:08.04
There's all kinds of stuff.

2043
01:58:08.04 --> 01:58:09.44
If you're in a leadership position, go there.

2044
01:58:09.44 --> 01:58:10.44
Guess what?

2045
01:58:10.44 --> 01:58:11.44
You're in a leadership position.

2046
01:58:11.44 --> 01:58:15.28
If you interact with other human beings, you're in a leadership position.

2047
01:58:15.28 --> 01:58:17.96
What else on a efonline, Dave?

2048
01:58:17.96 --> 01:58:19.56
We're there live all the time.

2049
01:58:19.56 --> 01:58:20.56
We're there yesterday.

2050
01:58:20.56 --> 01:58:21.56
We're there tomorrow.

2051
01:58:21.56 --> 01:58:24.80
You don't even know what day it is that you're listening to this podcast because it's

2052
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:26.36
either going to be today or tomorrow.

2053
01:58:26.36 --> 01:58:28.56
You can talk to us directly live.

2054
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:29.56
So come join us.

2055
01:58:29.56 --> 01:58:30.56
What is something awesome?

2056
01:58:30.56 --> 01:58:31.56
What is a question for Dave Burke?

2057
01:58:31.56 --> 01:58:32.56
What should they do?

2058
01:58:32.56 --> 01:58:34.96
They should come to efonline and ask me that question.

2059
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:37.28
What if they have a question for JP to not watch the day?

2060
01:58:37.28 --> 01:58:38.28
The same thing.

2061
01:58:38.28 --> 01:58:39.28
What if they have a question for me?

2062
01:58:39.28 --> 01:58:42.52
What if they say, well, you know, I Twitter, I sent nine tweets to Jocco, but he

2063
01:58:42.52 --> 01:58:45.36
an answer because he has to 80 million tweets.

2064
01:58:45.36 --> 01:58:47.36
What should I do?

2065
01:58:47.36 --> 01:58:48.36
Same thing.

2066
01:58:48.36 --> 01:58:49.36
Go to efonline.

2067
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:50.36
It's awesome.

2068
01:58:50.36 --> 01:58:51.36
Go to efonline.com.

2069
01:58:51.36 --> 01:58:53.08
We have a live event.

2070
01:58:53.08 --> 01:58:54.08
Muster 2020.

2071
01:58:54.08 --> 01:59:00.48
As the only one we're doing in 2020, we have, this is not the first live event we're doing.

2072
01:59:00.48 --> 01:59:01.64
We've done other live events.

2073
01:59:01.64 --> 01:59:02.64
I know you've done some live events.

2074
01:59:02.64 --> 01:59:04.64
I know I've done live events.

2075
01:59:04.64 --> 01:59:06.68
Look, they're social distance.

2076
01:59:06.68 --> 01:59:08.56
You can maintain the social distance.

2077
01:59:08.56 --> 01:59:16.12
We'll have the appropriate measures in place so that you can come to the muster.

2078
01:59:16.12 --> 01:59:17.12
It will be fully engaged.

2079
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:19.24
Look, one thing that's kind of cool.

2080
01:59:19.24 --> 01:59:24.20
At the muster, at the previous musters before COVID, there's a thousand people there.

2081
01:59:24.20 --> 01:59:25.52
There's 800 people there.

2082
01:59:25.52 --> 01:59:27.72
There's 900 people there.

2083
01:59:27.72 --> 01:59:31.32
So that means 900 people trying to talk to us during the breaks.

2084
01:59:31.32 --> 01:59:32.32
Whatever.

2085
01:59:32.32 --> 01:59:33.32
There's no green room.

2086
01:59:33.32 --> 01:59:34.16
If you've never heard of the green room, we're there.

2087
01:59:34.16 --> 01:59:35.16
We're talking.

2088
01:59:35.16 --> 01:59:39.08
If you want to hang out with us, if you want to get some information directly from us,

2089
01:59:39.08 --> 01:59:43.32
come to the muster, there's probably going to be a fraction.

2090
01:59:43.32 --> 01:59:45.20
I would say there's going to be less than half.

2091
01:59:45.20 --> 01:59:48.52
Probably going to be less than 500 people at the muster.

2092
01:59:48.52 --> 01:59:51.04
Believe me, you spread that out over a couple of days.

2093
01:59:51.04 --> 01:59:53.52
You're going to talk to us, ask the questions.

2094
01:59:53.52 --> 01:59:56.92
We'll do whatever we need to do to make sure that you come away from that with the knowledge

2095
01:59:56.92 --> 01:59:58.52
that you need.

2096
01:59:58.52 --> 02:00:02.80
Go to extremeownership.com for details there.

2097
02:00:02.80 --> 02:00:09.60
Of course, we have EF Overwatch if you need leadership in your team, which you do, we have

2098
02:00:09.60 --> 02:00:15.96
we are selecting leaders from the military that understand the principles we talk about all

2099
02:00:15.96 --> 02:00:19.76
the time and we're placing them into civilian companies into your business.

2100
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:24.16
Go to GFOverWatch.com if you need leaders in your company.

2101
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:28.76
If you want to help service members, active and retired, if you want to help their families,

2102
02:00:28.76 --> 02:00:35.76
if you want to help gold star families around the world, then check out Mark Lee's mom.

2103
02:00:35.76 --> 02:00:38.48
Mom and Lee, she's got a charity organization.

2104
02:00:38.48 --> 02:00:48.08
If you want to donate or you want to get involved, then go to americasmideawereers.org.

2105
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:54.60
And if you look, if you just are constantly seeking that hard path and you want to do things

2106
02:00:54.60 --> 02:01:00.20
that are tough, do things that cause you a little bit of suffering, then maybe you want

2107
02:01:00.20 --> 02:01:06.80
more of my gutteral groans as I talk.

2108
02:01:06.80 --> 02:01:11.52
Or maybe you want more of Dave's frothing phonetics.

2109
02:01:11.52 --> 02:01:18.20
Well, either way, you can find us on the in a web, on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Facebook,

2110
02:01:18.20 --> 02:01:26.12
Dave is at David R. Burke, and I am at Jocca Willink, and thanks once again to general Bruce

2111
02:01:26.12 --> 02:01:32.72
Clark for your service to America and for leaving these lessons of leadership behind

2112
02:01:32.72 --> 02:01:35.96
for us.

2113
02:01:35.96 --> 02:01:42.16
And thanks to all those people in uniform out there right now that are utilizing these lessons

2114
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:48.92
to protect freedom in the world and to police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

2115
02:01:48.92 --> 02:01:55.32
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all of the first responders.

2116
02:01:55.32 --> 02:02:01.84
Thank you for protecting us from chaos and mayhem here at home and to everyone else,

2117
02:02:01.84 --> 02:02:07.08
remember these lessons from general Clark.

2118
02:02:07.08 --> 02:02:08.72
Remember the importance of time.

2119
02:02:08.72 --> 02:02:10.72
That's where we started this whole thing today.

2120
02:02:10.72 --> 02:02:12.88
Don't forget about that one.

2121
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:14.04
Remember the importance of time.

2122
02:02:14.04 --> 02:02:15.36
The clock is ticking.

2123
02:02:15.36 --> 02:02:17.36
Trying to anticipate problems.

2124
02:02:17.36 --> 02:02:23.04
Be reliable, be knowledgeable, show initiative.

2125
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:27.96
And when you cast judgment, which I do I read these books, I think, oh, that person.

2126
02:02:27.96 --> 02:02:29.36
I wish that person would do that.

2127
02:02:29.36 --> 02:02:33.48
I wish that person would do the other thing.

2128
02:02:33.48 --> 02:02:42.68
And I remember that when you cast judgment, start off by judging yourself because it all

2129
02:02:42.68 --> 02:02:47.40
starts with you.

2130
02:02:47.40 --> 02:03:05.32
Until next time, this is Dave and Jocco.
