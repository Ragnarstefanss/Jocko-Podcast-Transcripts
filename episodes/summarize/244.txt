and so that's why when someone comes without the skill set in the civilian sector they can learn that skill set very quickly because they've been learning all these different skill sets for eight years 12 years 20 years 25 years that's what we do in the military it's a new stuff all the time going here section called the cost of talent when companies lack a talent mindset it's a common refrain cost creating a robust talent acquisition and management process is simply too costly they say what most companies don't understand is the major cost is not money but time and devotion to creating a world class talent acquisition pipeline in the process you will actually save money in the long run as your tuition lowers and you consistently make better hires the special operations community has long understood that people are everything special operations soldiers go through three main stages assessment and selection training and combat and war and then you guys break this out so in special operations it's called assessment and selection in business it's called talent acquisition or the hiring process and special operations it's called training in business it's called talent management and leadership development and then in special operations called combat and war and in business it's called business sales marketing production whatever is that you're doing it's a pretty good little break out there of how similar these things really are going in another section here may companies have a fundamental misalignment between upper leadership and HR where leadership says they want talent but HR is not set up to actually hire for talent in fact HR often doesn't even know what talent looks like in the company there's no gold standard of talent instead hiring is mechanical order taking process based on objective requirements leadership gives HR a laundry list of what they want years of experience required skill set compensation range and HR goes out and fills the order to have effective talent acquisition your business leaders and HR department must be strategic partners the talent acquisition team must be students of the business understanding the organizations underlying goals and talent needed to achieve them since day one in my career Joe DePento told us and that's the CEO of 711 I've always had my CHRO linked at the hip and will continue to as Joe is discovered to function strategically your HR department must be a part of the planning process for both talent acquisition and management HR should be involved in succession planning and gap analysis to assess select and develop talent in a strategic way you know we we found this you know I kind of knew it intuitively and I suspected it but but if I'm just company out there that wants to hire so I go to efoverwatch.com I fill out the various information and then we're going to set up a call and you're going to talk with Mike he'll talk to myself you may talk with one other person and we're going to really kind of dig in with you as to okay let's talk about your company what is your position in the market what are you trying to accomplish where are you trying to grow what are your leadership gaps what are your individual contributor gaps you know we want to know both of those things you know what are those things that are keeping you up at night and then let's talk about how talent and leadership solves those problems and are you committed to leadership is the most important thing in your business and you know we'll also walk through to find out the maturity of their hiring process and how they've done it because you know we we want to make sure that they know how to do because they're mechanics behind this as well we've helped with offer letters I've helped with compensation you know structuring complex offers which which is not easy for small and medium business to do a lot of times they just don't have that expertise so we will sit down and spend a good hour hour and a half with them you know diagnosing you know why did they come to us what is it that they need what can we solve for them and should we be working together and I'm sorry oh you know what hey we have an open position over here you know we've authorized 10 head count in this particular department you've got an empty seat what do you need that's not a plan that's just that's a button to see like we talked about you you have to take that time to say what does my organization look like as far as talent and people it's one of the many things that because everybody's focused on everything else they don't take the time to go what's gonna bring us into 21 what's gonna bring us into 22 you and like Don Roberts and said in our book you have to be higher for the skills and needs of the future where your company is gonna go and I think we even brought it up it's like the term is fighting in the last war you know you're not thinking ahead is to what you're gonna need and so there's no plan to go after that and build that for the future this is one of those things where you it happens to echelon front sometimes be working with a company and and you know they're whatever company is it happens all the time companies caught up in that firefight day to day they're trying to survive they're trying to make things happen they got projects do they got all the things going on Next section is about attracting top talent what talented people look for attracting talent requires knowing what talented people want many companies assume that the answer is money and perks they offer competitive salaries and wonderful creature comforts high end expression machines fully stocked kitchens pool tables and more and yet they still have rich talent on the other end we've seen countless people turn down higher pay to stay with the company where they feel challenged and love the people they work with if you want people to dedicate their talents to your company you must offer something equally valuable in return since talented people have high drive they are interested they're just as interested in achievement and challenge as money let's not fool ourselves if your compensation benefits are not competitive within your industry you'll lose out on talent but attracting top people goes beyond that beyond money talented people look for talented leaders and colleagues a sense of community a challenge opportunities for professional and personal growth and purpose talent attracts talent it's a magnet good leaders or you want to go even in my military career I know who those good leaders are and I'm like yeah uh a beast now I tell people I worked with Johnny Kim you know I start with Johnny Kim that's awesome the origins of the soft talent minds at the very core of soft is a talent mindset the idea that small group of talented individuals can be effective fighting force capable of defeating larger enemy forces in delivering strict strategic impacts through skull small scale operations three innate traits of lead spot special operations talent mindset and subsequent success one no one has prior special operations experience so raw talent must be the selection criteria the most effective selection is based on mindset and character that's a crazy thing to think about that when you go into special operations they're most of the time there's zero experience in special operations you know that's just that's like a crazy thing to think about where does that seal come from he comes from a high school you know this is the story you know we're working with business leaders and they think they need to experience it so important man Jeremy he's got four years of experience you go on most companies would choose Jeremy without hesitation Chris's GPA was average compares to Jeremy's but he didn't have the industry specific experience but he was one of those people who perform time and time again whatever you put in front of him you'd find a way through it over it or around it he was relentless and adaptable so you go on they they have eventually chose Jeremy over Chris and two weeks later the guy calls up and says we made a huge mistake that's how it turns out that click that click time and time again it and here's the funny thing is you remember tray holder who helped us out during the infancy of if ever watched we had this call and it was either we can have to two weeks after they made that selection and this leader within the company who we had a personal relationship said hey this guy is an arrogant you know what he's like we've got a problem and you know we're not going to say hey we told you so the guy he's trying to run a major distribution center he made a call we're there to support him and our basic question was well do you want to talk to our candidate he said no and said we asked what what are you going to do about it he said nothing and I just asked him was said if you have some of the that you feel is going to poison the culture why aren't you going to do anything and it was if I get let him go two weeks into the job my senior leaders are going to look at me like what are you doing down there and so that individual was going to let it ride I haven't talked to him I'm sorry so the the question jocca absolutely it's going to be a series of phone calls we want to know everything about your business about your industry and a lot of times the reason we do these phone calls because what business the leaders think they want is not necessarily what they need and our our job as well during that is to advise them based off what we're hearing what we think you really need is x, y, z, not a, b, c and our clients have followed our advice and it's worked out beautifully what you know we're in that advice is coming from nothing but scars and failures especially with 20 years of talent acquisition between him and uh currently so we we want a very very strong relationship with our clients if they sign the contract beyond that then it gets into the talent sink for what what what a talent sink is for us is we're going to spec out what that position is and what are the attributes they're truly looking for from there we we tell him hey we're going to need usually two to three weeks to start screaming and assessing potential leaders the the people the the right leaders for this position it could be through our organic town pool we're also going to run an external search for people we haven't touched yet that maybe out there that may be a good fit for that role and that takes time and our clients again we're preaching patience we have a pretty darn good fill speed rate to fill and if people allow us to go through our process John strike reminder was talking about that and how there was like people in the special forces community that were saying all this is garbage you're gonna get these guys that don't know what they're doing but like so many of those sag operators went right from boot camp to you know to a it and then on the special force and then they went right over to Vietnam and freaking just got after he he like was laughing about it because those guys were just freaking legit what with general boikom was telling the story you know you had senior leaders when he was the commander of use to sock which is he's the commander of all army special operations and they were arguing there's two camps of no we can't accept people without conventional infantry experience and the other camp was hey know we can take people off the street and turn them into great special forces soldiers and of course what there is a command soldier major use to sock sitting back the senior and listed visor wall both camps fought and finally he said when he piped in he said hey I was an OJT soldier in Vietnam yeah that's a big that's a big change actually it's not even that big of a change it's a little change that will have a huge impact you start getting people to really start to grow the or grow an organization properly with the right people that's exactly what you're talking about you go into this section here I'm skipping ahead this section here that I liked it's it's entitled fear based hiring special operations community has become world class model for potential based hiring which is their foundation of their assessment and selection process in contrast many companies instead of hiring the candidates with the most potential higher those candidates that inspire the least amount of fear this kind of fear based hiring usually comes down to one of three fallacies number one red flags are more important than green flags number two leaders shouldn't be outshined by their followers and number three somebody's better than nobody you go on in traditional corporate hiring practices the objective has seemingly shift from higher the best to higher the familiar and safe people are more afraid of a bad higher than they are excited by a good higher you go on here fear based hiring is dogmatic about objective requirements you guys already talked about this black and white criteria make it easy to say yes or no does this person have ex years of industry experience does this person have wide degree these criteria don't matter nearly as much as you might think the ten-conylbrient decor former commander of army special forces assessment selection told us when I arrived in my command anything easily measured was heavily weighted in the selection process the problem was it didn't have a lot of predictive value the same is true in business just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's important and just because you can't measure something doesn't mean it's not important the only question that truly matters is does this person have the potential to be a top performer don't disregard red flags entirely but don't obsess over them either in combat you don't want to get shot but at the same time if you're primary concern is not getting shot then you don't go into battle if you make your hiring decision based on avoiding your worst case scenario you'll never achieve your best case scenario it's far more effective to look for green flags than for red flags but you guys have pointed out earlier the US military is in the most powerful force in the world it's the US economy and that was one of the things we wanted to do with this book was to we want to continue to contribute to strengthen that you go into a skip and ahead a little bit you go into a scenario and it just it just spells out exactly what you're talking about you got a guy Daniel you go into this Daniel's looking to hire candidates for sales leadership position and he used two search firms EF Overwatch which is what which is excellent front and a competitor and Jeremy so this is here's the two people that got presented Jeremy presented by a competitive search firm 3.9 GPA from a prestigious university high intelligence four years of industry experience with two different companies driven highly competent borderline arrogant Chris presented by EF Overwatch 3.2 GPA from a public university above average intelligence faced significant adversity in life came from a lower middle class family and held a full-time job on college recently separated army infantry officer who held several different functional billets in the army has all the attributes are required to be a highly successful sales leader but lacks industry experience which of these candidates would you choose since this chapter is about hiring for character in scale you might know the answer is most likely Chris not Jeremy but be honest at your company which one of these candidates would most likely be hired that's a good question when you put be honest in front of it because right because it's a fear-based hire is to go you know what we don't know about this Chris guy he seems like a good guy using the army but but they're good people right and that those people will come back to you by the way I mean eventually they're gonna come back because you know somebody is over the reason they're leaving us because if you're treating people well the reason people are leaving us because someone is lying to them you know they're lying they're giving them some lying that they're not gonna be able to uphold so when people are leaving it's it's your alumni you got a treat them like you're alumni and say hey good luck let me know if you never need anything you know even though you're working for a competitor it's all right we came up with it good ago you say about nothing worth accomplishing it can be done alone there are no rampos in the military that might look cool in the movies but individual is die pretty quickly on the battlefield or worst get others hurt they're great success requires that we work together curiosity exploring the unknown and questioning the status quo and pursue to better more effective solutions is the key to innovation without curious individuals nothing would ever change or improve emotional strength in the US military and I'm given like these highly abbreviated definitions and you guys go into it not not only do you go into better examples but then not only not only more detailed definitions but examples you know you're talking about the rescue cap and films I mean you got really cool examples in here to back these things up but that's where people buy the books so that they can read those curiosity already covered that emotional strength in the US military the whole man concept is the belief that the individuals need to be assessed based on the entirety of their person mental physical and emotional and emotionally strong individual has a positive attitude high empathy and emotional control in stressful situations many of the individuals we interviewed identified positive attitude as important to their hiring decisions attitude is contagious positivity breeds positivity while negativity be gets more negativity an individual the negative attitude can still produce results but is often at the expense of company culture typically that one person who's also not worth the resulting damage to the team you have highlighted this section emotional strength is the ability to regulate ones emotions to remain logical under stress situations marsawk calls this stress tolerance and defines it as the ability to deal with ambiguous dangerous high pressure or frustrating events while maintaining control of emotions actions composure and effectiveness it is a universal truth in life that humans don't make good decisions in emotional state people who are able to remain cool calm and collected in the face of challenges and the unknown are people you want in your organization this is the exact reason soft creates stressful environments to mimic the conditions of war during assessment and selection programs stress tolerance is so important that some soft organizations even use heart rate monitors to evaluate individuals psychological physiological responses to stress got to stay calm got to be able to detach these were this chapter which so we do see companies that use these personality assessments as a either no go or go criteria and I would caution people not to do that you talked about not being a rules follower funny enough we had a company that recently assessed one of our people and you know I won't say what's physical organization this person works for but he's with a very unique or organization and he's been in that seat for five years which is an indicator that this guy is is a high performing individual ethical absolutely and when he took this test the company came back and said this guy's not you know it shows that he doesn't follow rules and we sort of had to explain the context of the role he was in and say he finds a way to win and that may be why he's not testing well in that one criteria on that assessment so you've got to be cautious even like Josh cotton Dr. Cotton that does this for a living what will caution you with regards to results on assessments he said you got to take it with a grain of salt and some people to use a phrase that that you know I remember hearing it muster actually assessment tests are not inoculations they don't insulate you from making a bad hire they don't inoculate you from you know all the risk in the world you need to use them as my says they're just one more data point and just I have to stop you from thinking that because I know that's what you think you want that's what that's what leaders think they think hey look I've got this all figured out if everyone would just do what I tell them to do run the playbook just do what I say to do will be good to go here's the thing there's no static function in the world that what you want is non-thinking apparatus to run a playbook and if you do if you have something like that yes automate that get a robot to do that task and do them over and over again the same way when you're hiding a leader you want them to be able to adapt and change and make improvements and do whatever they have to do to win that's what you want so if you hear George say hey we don't want someone that's just gonna run the playbook and you're thinking no way I do that do want that no you don't and this was the same thing is happen to the micro managers coming through my train when I was running training you get someone that's thinking hey look I've been I'm either I'm experienced or I know I'm highly educated I know how to run these operations so everyone if everyone just get in line and just do what I tell them to do will be good to go and what is that turned into it's micro management that you can't tell everyone what to do there's no way you can be everywhere or once and everything falls apart you need thinking shooters is what we used to call it Mike and I are working with you and everything goes perfectly you don't get to declare victory people grow people change products change the environment changes people move on you have to keep after this this is a discipline that you need to bring to your company and when you do you will have a competitive advantage it's the path it's part of the path back to the book far too often a company will hire talented candidate a talented candidate who's performance ends up being lackluster the company chalks up to a bad hire fires the person starts all over again a costly assumption there are many reasons someone might not be performing as you expect and only one of them is a bad hire chances are if a talented individual is not performing to standard it's not their fault it's yours a little extreme ownership coming at you live public talent work talent development you guys talk about training mentoring and coaching good quote and hear from Jonah Pinto from 711 CEO most important thing in any organization is leadership it's always leadership first because leaders find a way to get things done once again something up a great attitude and and for the listeners to open to is actually a west point the military academy graduate he served as a army officer before he entered the the corporate world leadership is the most critical determinant of achieving victory for business leaders are the ones who drive change makes things happen so when working to transform high potential high potentials into high performers it's critical to identify and develop future leaders that's just the way it's got to be and then wrapping this up a little bit here actually this I'll wrap this up right here with this like it's not quite the closer you know we were talking about to bring this over to the business world you know we talk about effective intelligence and people over indexing on experience they're wanting people to come and take a playbook and run it over here and and assuming that the situations that you're going to find in this particular business are going to be exactly the same and so they're thinking well they've handled these situations over here they'll be able to handle them here will be successful in the story it's the effective intelligence that's not assuming any course of action for a business problem they're looking at it that that ability to take the intellectual horsepower and look at all of the data points all of the indicators all of the little pieces of intel collect them and put them into a cohesive picture that then you explain simply with the plan of attack and it's so different than experience and if we can get people to index on that versus the experience you see the difference immediately you know George we actually we talk about the 70% solution that's a great example what you're you're explaining in a business context is again the guys that are wildly intelligent when they only have 70% of the operational picture they can't make a decision but people high in high effective intelligence can draw threads parallels and make a very decisive decision with interplayed information they're two or three years lied on the experience you were asking for I promise you this hungry they're hungry they want it they want to get after it and the manager says well they don't have the seven years of experience and it goes back to what Brian Decker said you know they picked seven years almost out of the year that seven years is not predictive of success working for a competitor is not predictive of success character attributes are predictive and you need to be watching for those check another fear but fear-based hiring problem leaders shouldn't be outshined by the followers average or underperforming managers often fear hiring someone who outshined them because they don't want to hire themselves out of a job there should never be a maximum standard for talent only a minimum if you're not hiring people better than your current employees you'll never raise the bar for talent within your organization that's just the classic surround yourself with people better better than you I want to work myself out of a job I want to have and we go in a little bit later about succession planning I need to have as many people who can take my place and corporate mercados and do that you know the succession planning we do in the military to muscle memory uh and then let us know uh next one special operations for since our teams teams win not individuals number three special operations teams work in high stakes environments when the stakes are high mediocrity is unacceptable let's look more closely at these traits raw talent this is this is no emphasis on experience raw talent is difficult to identify industry experience on the other hand is far easier to identify and measure this is why business world often falls in the bad habit of overaligning on industry experience and as a hiring criterion special operations does not have that luxury because nobody has prior special operations experience if the soft community began selecting for industry experience the US would not have a special operations community out of necessity special operations had to develop a core competency in potential based hiring where raw talent is the primary consideration that's self-explanatory next one team mentality special operations forces are structured as teams they are incentivized as teams and they win or lose as teams not as individuals in contrast in the biz world in the business world the egos can often rule and the team can be less and emphasized people are rewarded for individual achievements so individuals are often concerned only about their incentives versus the overall health of the organization bad leaders who hire and manage others often accept and often and even encourage mediocre employees because it raises their own value in comparison a team mentality greatly reduces the power of ego 're they're scared to death they want it it just turns into this machine how fast how fast can you hire how fast can you get that butt in the seat I'll take that step further at the risk of being a little bit of a stereo typing people but who's hungrier the person that you know has two years experience going into a role that needs five years experience or wait will you know or the person that has seven years experience going into a role with five years experience required who's who's hungrier who's trying to prove themselves a little bit more I don't know man I'm going to be in Georgia to hear hungry individual that wants to prove themselves and and and I've seen this time and again is you know the recruiters that I've brought up to town acquisition specialist I call them talent consultants because they're really embedded in the business they'll go have talked with this guy and and then you pointed out to me that whatever a year ago so come started an Instagram account so we see our own special operations community building their social media presence so that they can communicate with the next generation of special operations humans the military has been pretty good about this so back in the late nineties or mid nineties ex games was really coming to to to to to fruition and the military started creating their own extreme sports teams because that's where they knew the new talent is that that's where that you know the demographic of the 18 or I'm sorry let's say 15 year olds to the 25 year olds was was pushing towards that time where do you think the military is going now for recruiting video games e-sports teams they're putting e-sports teams together now if you asked our generation when they said hey we're going to go recruit out of the e-sports or video game town pools we'd probably say no way yeah that future seals and future marsawk you know Raiders and special forces are not going to come out of this communities that's wrong that's that's where the new talent lays not all that they're still town out there playing sports you know on teams wrestling and I think that's what you know sort of differentiates us from from a lot of the executive search firms out there is I know we together in George we're going to build this into the number one leadership town acquisition firm in the nation I have no doubt then when people look for directors of leadership in training as well as chief leadership officers they're going to say go to you if overwatch because the men and women were placing know how to train people they know how to create the foundation for strong cultures and that's really where we're making the name right now we'll still place people in the COO roles general management roles but one of my passions for you if overwatch is that that director of leadership in training or the COO position you know you talked about resiliency the whole point of a lot of you know the special operations assessment selection is to see how resilient people are he talked about in buds attracts much like the other special operations some pretty phenomenal human beings like NCAA athletes and Olympic athletes and when he ran first phase he saw a lot of these you know what people consider exceptional athletes quit and he said they were low on resiliency because this was the first time they had failed in their life and that's a point in the training as he says just to keep knocking people down to see how they react and when you have a high achiever who's never really experienced failure and they repeatedly fail in buds or these other assessment programs sometimes they quit and that's what you're looking for but somebody who's experienced nothing but obstacles in their life is well is more prepared for what they face in special operations and more equipped to deal with crisis than some of these exceptional athletes who just never really face challenge. so yeah you can get that amazon or like a google play anywhere where you can buy mp3 if you want a visual version of the path go to flipside canvas dot com owned by my brother decoda mire we he's putting this cool stuff on two things that you can hang on your wall flipside canvas dot com also we got some books we got some books first book talent war by my x-ray on George Randall step up get that we got the code we got leadership strategy in tackies field manual way the warrior kid one two and three mic in the dragon says this link was freedom field manual and extreme ownership and the economy of leadership if you like what we're talking about here check out some of those books books we got us on front leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership go to ashlan front dot com if you need help inside your organization aligning your leadership getting everyone on the same plan and rolling the boat in the same direction so that you can win ashlan front dot com we also have an online version of leadership training look you don't learn leadership in one day in one hour in one week in one month it's something you constantly have to check yourself on go to efo line dot com we totally revamped it we're doing live stuff all the time if you want to ask me a question if you want to ask me a question you can go to efo line dot com but they it all begins and ends with knowing what success looks like for a particular role and that requires thought it requires you know planning and and mapping that out how you're going to go do it like I said you got that chapter locked in the next chapter goes into the fact that you can't hire or fire your way to success talent acquisition is only one part of a two variable equation for success talent plus leadership equals victory and then there's a story in here about Mike and a little task unit that you were in called task unit Charlie and what's interesting about task unit Charlie so task unit bruiser and task unit Charlie and task unit alpha we're all at seal team three and every one of those task units had some great guys and you know if you put the bell curve on all of them they'd all be relatively the same group of you know seals Yeah you're gonna fail some stuff they're gonna make sure you fail some stuff 100% like you're not going to pass everything not care who you are they're going to make you sure you fail some stuff to make sure that when you do fail something you don't lose the bubble you talk a little bit about the interview process and you go into the interview process here and here's a strategy on on you go a bunch of stuff I'm gonna skip to one part for guidance on strategy look to special operations murder boards murder boards are not quite as terrifying as they sound they are full of pressure but professionally run and operators sits on one side of the table and on the other side is a psychologist and five to eight senior enlisted and officers representing the entire community the psychologist has previously assessed the operator to identify potential red flags the senior panel then digs in raising the pressure by probing the red flags and presenting complex scenarios they ask difficult questions and push against sore spots to see how the operator reacts if you approach your interviews a little more like a soft murder board you can reveal valuable information to that end we have five tips number one know what you're looking for with each question number two create a core set of questions to be used with each candidate number three ask scenario based and behavioral questions number four add challenges number five push candidates outside their comfort zone gotta be careful on the legal side of this I mean we walked into a dumpster fire frankly so when we walked into and we were able to do great things but that that value in that ownership that they gave me that I was able to give everybody on my team it's everything and so when you come into this moment's reconciliation becomes an issue that value that empowerment that ownership you give people they stick and in two years we had zero percent attrition wow is that you know what's amazing though is that that's a surprise to people and you know I'm kind of sitting back going how can that be so so much of a surprise that giving somebody ownership and trust and value is everything the most important thing the best form of compensation and the reason I've been able to tell that to clients at Ashland front is I say look I had people that you knew in the Sealteams in the military in the Navy if you're doing the best job you know three times better than anyone else in your opportunity I can't give you a raise because the consequences of having a poor hiring process can sink a company one of the statistics we found is that for senior level executive positions the cost of a bad senior leader can be 213% of that individual's annual salary so giving example if there you have a 300 thousand dollar salary CEO or executive that could cost the company is highest 639 thousand that's let's say that's a direct cost so what a lot of companies can't track from a tuition is really the the indirect cost and that's about two thirds of the cost of a tuition you can't put a number on the damage to a culture that a senior leader can cost maybe for two years that impacts sales and that's what's very hard for a lot of companies because they can't see it on their bottom line directly good CEOs can come hang out to national on front and go work with some clients and you you'll get to see that all the time toxic leader a bad leader a leader with a negative attitude everyone below them either doesn't perform well or leaves if they're good and you know it is the good people as we said earlier the good people leave the bad people stay there and don't perform well that's what happens on their bad leader it's total nightmare what would see a little I think Henry Ford is credited with this characters revealed at one's limits and there's a subsection called mic feels the pressure this is it Mike thought staring up the rope i'm going to fail out of buds because of a freaking rope two weeks prior mic it completed hell week the instructors had even pulled them aside and said you're one of the standout leaders in the class we know what you can do as a leader so we need you to step aside so that we can test and evaluate other officers yet now mic was struggling to climb a basic rope like he had been climbing since day one of the Marine Corps he had been climbing ropes for years and he was good at it he'd never failed to get up one until now for the first time in training mic was displaying serious signs of fatigue it was an ideal moment to test him so the instructors dug in shouting up at him the other students who had already completed the exercise watched from their nearby formation mic started up the rope again he could sense all eyes on him he could feel the pressure he made it ten feet and dropped the instructors kept yelling and mic started up the rope again and again and again mic was frustrated he felt like a dirt bag for not being able to get up the rope but there was no way he was going to quit he started up the rope again and fell again he got to his feet and prepared to start up the rope again but the instructors stopped him and pulled him aside out of view from the other students it's okay we all have these days one of the instructors said we wanted to apply some pressure to you to see how you would react and whether you would quit the instructors didn't really care whether mic made it to the top of the rope or not good little test see where it's at that that day and again I'd been in the Marine Corps for what five years at this point climb plenty of ropes was going to climb the ropes I remember that day just something with the body was off hey hey I'm like I'm there I'm there you know he goes do you want to talk about the compensation I said no let's just move let's go and the great part is is that you know there's a lot of bad habits that get you into a vicious cycle but attracting great talent gets you into a positive cycle of attracting better talent all the time you're alumni in the people currently in your organization are the best way to attract talent hands down I mean you're doing it right now you've probably caused a lot of young men and women to in list or seek missions in the military based off the lessons that are learning it's just you know everybody in your company is a talent scout everybody in your company is an example of what you hold as important especially your leaders when they're out in the public and everybody should always be looking we talked about this like you know the term is opportunistic hiring most people are only hiring for an open position but if you've got talent scouts out there they're bringing talent to you and saying you know what dispersions a difference maker this isn't a player we have got to find a place in our organization well you know one of the many mistakes that you know once you get past you know making sure that your chief human resources chief human resource officer is strategic and tied into your CEO you have to look ahead you know at that old adage if you if you fail to plan you're planning to fail people look at talent and recruiting and staffing is hey we've got these open positions let's crank it there's not often a plan behind it and that starts with looking at your company and it starts with going but it didn't really work out that way from a leadership perspective no it did not so pulled from the same talent pull away like you said the talent profile for both the task units was the exact same and this is where you know we caution people in the you know this is why we end the book with this chapter is you had two groups where the resources the talent everything was predominantly the same same budgets same weapon systems same people really and one rise raised to the occasion and one fell below the standard in the seal teams and was toxic and the final determination was leadership so bad leadership can poison any talent pull of exceptional people so it's a group of MBAs who were off the charts intelligence had industry experience were were currently getting their MBAs and then a group of undergrads you're talking 18 19 20 year olds first group of 27 to 35 year olds and you know naturally Brian Decker and his cadre you know they were shown a good time but had an assumption that the MBAs were just going to outperform the undergrads like cans down how do you think that I know the undergrads absolutely decimated every obstacle much quicker than the MBA group and it goes to to show you that you know that even though they had prior experience more vast experience those undergrads actually because they lacked ego so it's yes and he thought about it he said you know what I think we're better off without him and you know that to me that was a little litness test for me because you know Laef might be thinking hey I'll just replace him with some other guy and we'll you know we'll step it up it was a litness test for me to see what Laef really was thinking and if you really would rather not take someone that means you don't feel comfortable with him at all so there's a quote from Charlie Beckwith for the listeners Charlie Beckwith is the founder of Delta Force you know surf time with the SAS which generated the idea for for a specialized force yet a quote that was I'd rather go down the river with seven studs than 100 shitheads and it goes to point that it's recruiting selecting training mentorship putting the right people in the right places think about that's what putting the right people in the right places all those things are really one thing and that is leadership and this is how you build a team and leaders have to understand the importance of that they have to understand the importance of building the correct team so one thing that we're doing you know is obviously helping people build these teams with EFO overwatch tell me a little bit about the process at EFO for watch to take and find the right people bring them in and get them assigned to the right companies out there these and you and you have to to your point encourage that too and if you have good number two you're falling you don't worry about it but reach out to somebody and say hey how are you doing you know what hey if things aren't going well there hey give me a call give me a call because we love to have it in your hair you wouldn't believe how many people are going you know what they don't have to admit that they made a mistake they're going you know what it wasn't as good it wasn't as good and I think also you you you say it seems like an obvious statement and yet there's so many organizations that let those things slide and here's the problem with letting things slide when it comes to integrity once this is you know this slippery slope sometimes they say a slippery slope fallacy because you know well just because I did this doesn't really mean I'm gonna do that the slippery slope when it comes to integrity is I think is almost unstoppable thing because you know if I let echo get away with something well now he's got something on me and now he lets me get away with something we go back and forth we go on this downward spiral and there's no one that can I once I once I give up my integrity I give up my ability to tighten anyone else's integrity up and you've also said a new standard you've put your personal stamp on approval the that behavior is now tolerated yeah you guys break it down and hear what you have to do what you have to do to create this talent acquisition plan defining greatness in your organization identify your high performance as a session talent objective assessments just you guys go line by line and explain all these things in great detail build your talent profiles mic you already mentioned that workforce plan I mean you just go through the detail so that people that don't have a plan can actually open up this book and put a plan together so that they're moving forward with a route right with a route instead of just moving forward in the blind which is crazy to think about and yet it happens all the time it's just start with the conversation the senior leaders and companies are not having this conversation and that's where it starts there's many ways to go about this you don't need to bring you know bring in a top five consulting firm and you weren't going to be able to maneuver at all because you're doing things wrong so the best way to retain your talent is great leadership and it goes back to bufre we just did he have battlefield the guysburg you know he operated within the spirit of the commanders intent and actually deviated from what was the plan because he saw an opportunity I think what the Marine Corps calls it took authority on demand and made calls that ultimately made the union army you know victorious over the the Confederates you know you did say something about and we deal with this with you have a watch is for some companies it's a mental leap to hire a military leader into a senior management role when they're coming fresh out of the military and you know when you're you know we always feel like when our service is over in the military we want to serve more and what you guys are doing right now to help veterans transition out of the military getting the civilian sector and get on their next mission you've heard me say to thousand times veterans need a new mission when they leave that mission that they've dedicated their life to they get out they need a new mission they're looking for a new mission you guys are doing a great job providing that mission form so thank you for that and to all the veterans and all the active duty troops that are out there on the front lines now or of held the line in the past thank you for protecting all ability to pursue life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and board of patrol and secret service and all the other first responders thank you for protecting us when evil closes in and everyone else out there making things happen is hard accomplishing your mission is hard life is hard but there's you can carve a simple balance where they know they're going to be tested in your environment and those people that know they're going to be tested in your environment the right people are going to be drawn to your environment because of that test any any person who's of talent that's worth their salt that comes to an easy interview process and rocks it in the back of their head when they walk out the doors are going but they're listing out experience and hiring majors will dump all of this stuff in thinking if I get all of this this experience and one person my company will do better they're looking at the wrong things it's the character it's those attributes that make the difference when when a COVID comes up when when a when another company comes out with a product when you know we're behind or or we're short team members it's those character attributes that drive that team forward when things get tough when you're under stress that's when character reveals itself and in the business world that's when it counts the most so we over rotate on experience and you know you know they just they just keep digging themselves now another tactic to that is after you put the person through a murder board it's like one person goes out and say hey what how'd you feel about that process what what do you think you can do better what areas didn't you expand upon to see now if they can do a what do we call a brutally honest self assessment like hey you know what man I wish I could do that again I missed this this I didn't reinforce this point and so if that person's training they come back in and say hey real real self reflective after action that they just gave and one of the reasons that we put this specific technique in there is because most interviews and companies are done on a one-to-one basis and Jocco echo I bet I you could I could put you in one of these murder boards and you could watch three other people ask questions and they'll have their opinions but just in the observation mode that is of tremendous value just to watch people how they answer how they act how they think how they reasoned through a particular scenario how they explain their problem solving methodology
