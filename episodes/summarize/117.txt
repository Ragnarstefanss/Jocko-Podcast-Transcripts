yeah because you kind of know when you're being a dick you don't see unless you're like not being honest with yourself there are some people that don't there's some people that don't get it there's some people that don't get it all right because it's like you know how like when you don't like people they just can't step outside of themselves and you said to me I wouldn't care kind of thing and be like bro but I think you're more if you go extreme with the diet you don't like slowly phase out of the way you know it's interesting you know it's interesting I don't know if you remember I read a letter while back on the podcast about a guy that had read way the warrior kid and he like fixed his life and that guy did what you're saying he just made little changes you know he made little changes along the way but yeah you kind of don't see all the other factors or whatever almost like you if you really think about it if Steve Jobs were to be like in these tyrannical ways or whatever if you were to be less like that maybe there would be more because they were more similar but he was so strong in these other areas that it kind of like mitigated the effects you know there's there's businesses that are successful because there are successful business model and they have really bad leadership and that's you've been really that bad of a cheat day a cheat day is like fries fries then you're starting to go into it for sure but the I'm like you know a cheat day cheat day like asked Tim held it'll be like for like a whole thing of donuts re box a cook and then they just continue to do it more and more and more and then it doesn't work it's like it's kind of like drugs to regret the like when you like when you flare up on someone and and you win or whatever you know you kind of like it worked nine cups of cheetos later you know what you see and then two cups and respectfully I don't like your cheetos example why because you're like I'm going to allow myself cheat okay don't allow yourself cheetos that's not how small of a change you're going to make if you're not going to eat cheetos anymore you're not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm saying like if you go extreme on your diet let's say you eat yes maybe you should check your ego a little bit then you have to ask yourself do you have an eye for design on artistic eye for design like like divinci or Michelangelo if you have that you you you probably don't if you think you have that maybe you should check his ego again are you a gifted speaker and storyteller and can you convey your vision with total clarity to big giant groups broad groups of people and if you think you can do that again you should check your ego can you count on luck or do you want to count on luck to to close the gaps in some of those other areas so if you could do all those things if you answered yes 100% to all those questions and okay maybe you can get away with being a kind of leader that Steve Jobs was but if you're a normal person if you're a normal human being then maybe you should try and be a good leader and maybe you should be a leader that build relationships and forms cohesive teams and coalitions that help you drive your mission forward despite the ups and downs of whatever business you're in and I know this with you because let's say if I pass your guard sorry you let me pass your guard I don't know you don't spaz and like you know like an tournament where the guys like really trying hard not to let you settle in guard yeah maybe what's the verdict I think just in the like middle of the road not the whole story like same thing I said balance so you're saying balance as well I'll tell you though man if that balance doesn't work for you you're gonna have to step it up you're gonna have to go hardcore I'd give yourself two weeks two weeks for a balanced approach on the diet side if you can't get your shit under control in two weeks you got to go hardcore you got to get in there with a garbage client can throw away the Twinkies throw away everything else that's crap in your fridge and go hardcore and start with a fast too right yeah which is a little bit contrary because you know I always say leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield but in the business world if you have a phenomenal idea then you can you can be successful on that idea alone now that is that is a unicorn that is one of those rare things where you have something that's that incredibly different and stands out from the crowd so much that it's going to be successful no matter what you know when the when the early gyms MMA type gyms if you had one you were successful didn't matter what kind of leader you were because you had you had it and now there's competition if you're not if you're not good leadership and you're not putting forth a good product amongst all the competitors you're going to have problems but after the things you can't just eat donuts four times a day or three you just don't feel good like your stomach gets all upset and the more healthy you eat the more it's gonna be like that so the longer you're on the path you straight like if you ate some donut like the other day we went to the Belmont Park and I ate some ice cream some mid-chocolate chip ice cream was it and I think that's like the mistake planning people make we say this a lot where people will be like hey I'm just straightforward you know take me take it or leave it kind of thing and be like you know what they call framing you know you frame something in a certain way to make it kind of sound a certain way whatever so he's an extremely driven and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and they're developing negative attitude so having extremely being extremely driven and having high expectations doesn't equal driving them too hard so they develop negative attitude those are two different things you know you can still be extremely high expectations you can be driving extremely hard and you can still have a incredibly positive attitude with your team yeah that's the way it is we and this is like my thoughts this is fact this is like I talked about this in this in the field manual is like look there's no conjecture it's not like I wonder what would happen no it's not my fault when I my subordinates have a bad attitude or something like that and about a bunch of people responded you should read the book extreme ownership because it absolutely is your fault it is your fault if your team has a bad attitude it's your fault you're the leader you only attitude if they're attitude is bad then it's then it's actually your fault now this is not to say that you can't have a bad apple on the team that's completely possible and who's responsible for getting rid of the bad apples you are you're the boss because the fact of the matter is you might have a uh bad apple on your team you might even have two bad apples on your team you don't have 14 bad apples on the team when you have 14 battles the apples on the team guess who the problem is it's you whatever so if you if you're at that point still facing a threat of someone with a bottle or kicks to the head or whatever while you're on the ground compare if you know Jesus you're still saving way more control way more so meanwhile like the box situation or karate situation whenever it's gonna be less effective in controlling your situation no if you don't look at it like that like if you look at it but you said you know what you need to do and one time you said imagine what your day would look like like if you like everything you did was you did the things that you knew you're supposed to do kind of thing your boxing is your boxing is not worthless you know marginalized we'll say but it's heavily marginalized yeah heavily marginalized yeah same thing with you know kickboxing and whatever so there's that if you know Jesus you're just a little bit of Jesus too if you're on the ground you have control over the fight more depending on your level and it's own right garners respect from most people there's there's a fraction of losers that are like oh echo he works so much it's it's so lame like no like as I'm making him look bad or something like they're you know we'll know that you know little chocolate Domets you know what a total full size donut straight up they're kind of a little bigger too you know Because you know how the old saying where it's like, yeah, we know we had to have a limited time on this earth, but we don't act like it. you know there's just a very relaxed atmosphere where I was I was standing at a very nice part of Australia there's a very relaxed atmosphere when you're in America there's a heightened atmosphere there's a heightened awareness you have to have and depending on where you are and it's the same thing I'm sure in Australia I'll go on the way to the nice part I'm sure you could go to some some tough areas where you better be more aware of what's happening but teach your kids because some kids don't know the difference maybe you don't even know the difference of what to look out for what kind of people you need to watch out for in the street so work on that and then yes train and up here in U.K. and of course I've said this before if you're truly in a situation where you feel threatened on the regular basis oh I'm like tired now because the workout like was kind of hard it's like oh shit I wasn't expecting that I was expecting to feel right after my workout everyone says whatever so you're gonna run into all these little things that don't tell you about so i'm i've answered this question over and over again and i'm going to do a quick job over here just because people may not they have gone back and listen to all all the other podcasts but you have listened the answers always the same and it's always the same whether you're a young person leading old person whether you're an old person leading young for people whether you're a woman leading man a man leading man leading women whether you're coming in from a different department into a new department that you don't know anybody whether you're going into a thing that you don't have the experience it's like all of the same basically what it is you're going into a leadership position and on that on that cheat day you do they call it the cheat day you eat whatever you want and you don't feel any guilt at all even when you're on the 80 20 it's like you have to become an off a real strong week to like be to feel good about cheat for three like three burgers are good too whatever you want straight up whatever you want this is disgusting here's the thing though with when you when you start to eat healthy and you then you try to eat a whole box of donuts you're after like one two three maybe six eight donuts you're gonna be like you know you're in six donuts easy you're in six donuts in one yeah that's what it is be humble listen take advice build relationships keep your ego in check also that one of the reasons i pulled the dead pull this question i was like how do you demand respect will be answers you don't demand respect and if you don't if you do demand respect you'll get anything but respect from people so so get that out of your head you earn respect and how do you earn respect you respect them in this case you respect their experience you respect their knowledge you respect it they've been doing it for a long time you have respect for it and when you show respect for them they're going to respect you back now none of this means be passive right this doesn't mean coward down unless yeah you know construction or something you know something like that same thing you're gonna get joint stuff that's so yeah you start with what you can do but there is a little bit of there is there is I would try I would say this keep this one in the in the back of your mind there is the whole thing of like you know what I'm changing my life right now you go home you get the garbage can out you bring it into the kitchen you throw away the twinkies you throw away the pop-tarts you throw away the the you pour the the crappy soda down the drain and you get on the path and you just don't look back but I have all this other knowledge the same rule you try it for two weeks see if you can keep yourself on the path and if you can't got to bring someone in right here's what I like hire a trainer but not like the kind every day it's like a once a week trainer who can get you on a little program So it's like when that happens, it almost like it catches you off guard, you know, when you when you did that, I mean, obviously not like, oh, drop cool start, it's not that feeling at all. but i look at leader a leader like Steve Jobs who's known for his hostile attitude toward people isn't that being de-falte aggressive like you talk about if i'm more naturally that type of leader should i go with it if it worked for Steve Jobs shouldn't it work for me so that's a good question and i haven't actually read the book about Steve Jobs and i think there's probably more than one yeah always that cool next question actually that problem is so solvable that you could this is possible where you could just show just that much like more I don't know caring or respect just that much respect and do for like two weeks yeah just the idea that just the fact that you're doing it now people will be like hey wait you should leave it here's the thing here's the thing if a person has an ego which this person could very well have a big ego because that's why they have these high expectations and that's why they're so driven because they just they if they have that kind of ego that's the person that you can't help because if they just look at the team and say those guys should be harder workers that's why you you can't relax because you don't know if you're safe or not so you're just trying to move and get out of there or you know get that's a mission hurry up before he does something you know where the supplies to life this applies to life in when you're interacting with other people and you start to let's say you and I are having a disagreement about something right and you start getting the upper hand on me and instead of me trying to use a technique to get out all I do is go let's do Brideco I think so I think that helps I always looked at it like why would I hire like a trainer or something like that when I can kind of look up that stuff but clearly here's someone asking this question now again like if you have some members of the team that are that are actual negative complaining winers then you might have to get rid of them and that's part of being a leader is knowing when you have to get rid of someone you know I sometimes people they they take the extreme ownership attitude and they say you know what I'm the leader I own everything I'm extreme ownership and if someone's not performing well then that's my fault and I forget and like dang if if I eat not having an eight for like you know 12 hours 16 then I'll be like I'm the small change is I'm not going to eat cheetos anymore I'm going to cut out cheetos that's it I'm still not eating that good you know I'm going to cut out cheetos or let's say I get you know drive through every day three times a day and the more I kind of listen to you in life the more I realize that even then the like it's almost like you have to have a minimum level of leadership like you don't be have to be perfect if you have one of these situations where the product of the business is so good but still even your leadership can mess that And even during, like, while it was going on, I had a group on the site of like a good, like, 12 people. wait I don't even know that there's that much to expect don't ever for a day if you never done it before it's not that bad of a deal there's no little stuff don't eat your day there's little there's not take you from a normal human being this little stuff that you if you're not if you go in and not prepared for it then you're like I actually think the more you think about it prepared for it the more psychologically or it is it's not that it's okay now what technique do you need to implement to keep myself safe and the more you know about the jutsu the more you realize it doesn't take a huge amount of energy to to implement that technique it's usually just like an arm position make sure his hip is like over there and not over here and that's kind of that's it that's pretty much it but I'm relying on brute force as opposed to technique now it could be also like we talked about earlier could be that I'm wrong and if instead of admitting that I'm wrong or or taking like you're saying relax and looking at the technique and saying you know what echo has a point here that I can't debate against he's right a fat lazy you know especially if you're older or something like that I think seen a doctor is it how old is it to get a personal trainer depends on when you need to help me the woman I just talk to she's like personal trainer and nutritionist hired them both lost 100 whatever pounds like you like I'm basically confirming what you just said the good business model will get you to a certain level but then to get to the next level you're gonna need leadership and that's why leadership's the most important thing on the battlefield mm-hmm I mean half guard right now because you know all like in the beginning when you first learn the the positions you're like half guard is real clear guard is real clear. so unless you're just committed to eat it because I don't know you don't want to waste it or something like that you're gonna be like right he was completely obsessed with doing good and all that and and he pressed toward his vision extremely hard he was relentless in trying to make things happen and again those are very positive characteristics if you got someone that's really driven and they're driven to the point of almost being obsessed and you you take that and those are kind of good characteristics but when they go to far this is why it's dichotomous the balance of leadership right when when you go to far you become a tyrannical leader which is not good it's not good for a team and it's it seems like this question always comes from a place where they just assume all these things and those things are I'm going to choose to get in a fight with someone bring it to the ground in the middle of the street or in the club I don't know wherever wherever there's potential other attackers with bottles man kicks to the head and so all these things are just assumed kind of but it doesn't work in the broad sense of what you're trying to make happen yeah slowly pulling apart that's a question i'm 26 years old i'm currently an undercover detective i've recently been told that i'm being promoted to sergeant over department's investigations division i've been the youngest person to hold that position in our department's history all the guys i'll be in charge of our much older some in their late 40s how do i as a younger leader lead them how do you demand an earn respect from an older group i'm ready for the job and know what the job entails but i'm nervous to lead a group of nine people that are all older than me yeah let's check check X-Wish juggle I'm extremely extremely driven and have high expectations for myself and my team it appears that now I may have pushed them too hard and their developing negative attitudes I feel like you're going to say play the game and develop relationships with them which are really just ignore who I am should I try to be someone different than myself it's movement that's happening you know when to you know when someone's gonna accomplish something and if you're gonna fight it with muscle you're gonna you're gonna end up losing and you said all these scenarios you run away you go away you want to keep yourself safe you don't be there the best thing to do to avoid the the getting punched falling on the curb dying getting stabbed getting kicked getting stabbed with the bottle getting arrested getting lawsuit getting all those things happening the best thing to run away walk away yeah leave fully but if you go straight extreme on your diet like all of a sudden you're hit with these the byproducts of changing your diet especially if you if you'd like like mountain do every single day because you're your book knowledge when you start off in this situation your book knowledge isn't as strong as the experience guys in in this case you know in the in the law enforcement the guys that have been in the streets they know stuff that you don't know and when I matter she's completely normal right like you know completely like you wouldn't even suspect that she had any weight trouble in her life yeah the weird thing is like nutritionist and stuff you can get nutritionist that could come to you and be like but then I don't know you hear about these guys just like how you said they just they throw everything away they're like I'm a different person But and I said this to you one time I was like you have like strength you're strong and you were like not defensive you know what I'm only gonna get a quarter bag of cheetos a day from now on I don't think that works I think you got to be like
