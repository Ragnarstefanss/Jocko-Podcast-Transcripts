00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.44
This is Jockel Podcast number 129.

2
00:00:04.44 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Winlic.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:12.24
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.24 --> 00:00:19.56
Cry had risen for the reserve, and it must come as soon as possible.

6
00:00:19.56 --> 00:00:22.40
We ran what we could run.

7
00:00:22.40 --> 00:00:27.76
Our Lieutenant Colonel Fell killed almost at the first.

8
00:00:27.76 --> 00:00:39.76
Beyond this, we lost our major, and indeed all of the officers, but three, only.

9
00:00:39.76 --> 00:00:44.72
We had crossed two successive ditches which lay in an orchard to the left of the first

10
00:00:44.72 --> 00:00:52.60
houses in, and we were beginning to form in front of the village.

11
00:00:52.60 --> 00:00:55.40
But there was no standing of it.

12
00:00:55.40 --> 00:00:59.96
Besides the general cannon fire, such as hardly can be imagined.

13
00:00:59.96 --> 00:01:06.44
There was also a reign of K-shot upon this battalion of which I, as there was no Colonel

14
00:01:06.44 --> 00:01:11.48
left, had to take command.

15
00:01:11.48 --> 00:01:17.84
A third battalion of the royal Prussian foot guards, which had already made several of our

16
00:01:17.84 --> 00:01:24.96
regiments past that same kind of muster, gave at a distance of 80 paces, the liveliest

17
00:01:24.96 --> 00:01:28.20
fire upon us.

18
00:01:28.20 --> 00:01:38.64
It stood as if on the parade ground that third battalion, and waited for us without stirring.

19
00:01:38.64 --> 00:01:43.16
The Austrian regimen at our right hand could not get itself formed properly because of the

20
00:01:43.16 --> 00:01:44.16
houses.

21
00:01:44.16 --> 00:01:51.08
It was standing 30 deep, and sometimes it's shots hit us in the back.

22
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:57.64
And my left the Austrian regimen ran its way, and I was glad of that in comparison.

23
00:01:57.64 --> 00:02:03.84
By no method or effort could I get the dragons who stood 50 yards to the rear of me to cut

24
00:02:03.84 --> 00:02:08.76
in a little and help me out.

25
00:02:08.76 --> 00:02:15.32
My soldiers who were still tired from running had no cannon support, were scattered,

26
00:02:15.32 --> 00:02:22.64
if you were in number and were mainly fighting out of solidness.

27
00:02:22.64 --> 00:02:28.000
It was more out of honor than the notion of doing good in the affair that prevented us

28
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.20
from running off.

29
00:02:32.20 --> 00:02:38.12
Finally, two officers of the grenadiers brought me what they still had.

30
00:02:38.12 --> 00:02:47.96
Among Garyans, two were luckily got together, but at last we've all helped and the remnants

31
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:51.88
of my own brave battalion.

32
00:02:51.88 --> 00:02:58.60
I drew back.

33
00:02:58.60 --> 00:03:07.76
And that right there is a report from Charles Joseph Lomoral.

34
00:03:07.76 --> 00:03:15.40
The Prince, Prince Deling, I believe is how you say it, who is a captain in the Austrian

35
00:03:15.40 --> 00:03:20.08
army fighting against the Prussians during the seven years war.

36
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:30.84
A particular battle was the battle of Luth, which took place on December 5th, 1757.

37
00:03:30.84 --> 00:03:39.84
Where the Austrians suffered about 22,000 casualties about one-third of their forces.

38
00:03:39.84 --> 00:03:46.80
That was at the hands of the Prussian army who interestingly had about half the number of

39
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:51.80
troops as the Austrians.

40
00:03:51.80 --> 00:04:01.20
And the Prussian army was led by a guy by the name of King Frederick II who became known

41
00:04:01.20 --> 00:04:05.92
as Frederick the Great.

42
00:04:05.92 --> 00:04:11.44
And you know this type of fighting was brutal.

43
00:04:11.44 --> 00:04:19.04
And it's sort of the classic vision of the old European infantry tactics like what

44
00:04:19.04 --> 00:04:27.44
you picture troops lined up by rank marching forward to close with the enemy.

45
00:04:27.44 --> 00:04:35.88
In what often became just a test of will and courage.

46
00:04:35.88 --> 00:04:41.80
And who's will and who's courage was stronger, who would drive forward and who is going

47
00:04:41.80 --> 00:04:44.92
to back now and who's going to run away.

48
00:04:44.92 --> 00:04:50.88
But on top of that will encourage you also there was still maneuvers happening out there.

49
00:04:50.88 --> 00:04:54.32
And the movements were centralized.

50
00:04:54.32 --> 00:04:57.000
But the maneuvers were still happening.

51
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.36
And the battle field still required there to be leadership.

52
00:05:02.36 --> 00:05:07.32
So maneuver these elements around to assess what was happening and then to drive the troops

53
00:05:07.32 --> 00:05:12.40
to get the job done leadership was absolutely required in one of the most respected leaders

54
00:05:12.40 --> 00:05:21.48
of this era was the leader at that battle of the Prussians, Frederick the Great.

55
00:05:21.48 --> 00:05:30.44
Now Frederick the Great, interesting character, born in 1712 his father, Frederick William.

56
00:05:30.44 --> 00:05:35.20
And he seemed like one of those kind of tyrannical fathers that really pushed his son

57
00:05:35.20 --> 00:05:37.36
with extreme discipline and all that.

58
00:05:37.36 --> 00:05:40.92
And guess what, young Frederick didn't like it.

59
00:05:40.92 --> 00:05:42.40
Didn't like it.

60
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:44.40
Wasn't in to that.

61
00:05:44.40 --> 00:05:45.80
You know what he was into?

62
00:05:45.80 --> 00:05:47.80
Music, literature.

63
00:05:47.80 --> 00:05:49.12
That's what he was into.

64
00:05:49.12 --> 00:05:53.56
And he actually plotted an escape to England.

65
00:05:53.56 --> 00:05:56.48
And he had a couple of his buddies helped him out.

66
00:05:56.48 --> 00:05:58.32
Had a little plan, put the plan together.

67
00:05:58.32 --> 00:06:02.12
I'm going to get away from my tyrannical dad who's trying to, you know, turn me into this

68
00:06:02.12 --> 00:06:08.56
warm-ongering guy and the plot caught foiled.

69
00:06:08.56 --> 00:06:16.40
And the king actually captured one of the two friends that was helping young Frederick

70
00:06:16.40 --> 00:06:19.48
and incented him to death.

71
00:06:19.48 --> 00:06:24.16
And young Frederick had to watch his friend who had tried to help him get beheaded.

72
00:06:24.16 --> 00:06:27.52
Yeah.

73
00:06:27.52 --> 00:06:35.16
And despite that, he eventually got on board with becoming a military leader and become

74
00:06:35.16 --> 00:06:41.28
in King and he gained reputation for being extremely aggressive on the battlefield.

75
00:06:41.28 --> 00:06:42.28
And there's a good quote.

76
00:06:42.28 --> 00:06:45.76
I think, no, not only had a good quote about him, which was something along the lines

77
00:06:45.76 --> 00:06:49.92
of if Frederick the Great was still here, we wouldn't be here.

78
00:06:49.92 --> 00:06:52.08
So he got a lot of respect.

79
00:06:52.08 --> 00:06:57.36
And he led very successful campaigns all over Europe.

80
00:06:57.36 --> 00:07:04.000
He was known for having an extremely hard work ethic, strong work ethic.

81
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.36
Interestingly, he woke up at either four or five o'clock in the morning every morning.

82
00:07:09.36 --> 00:07:12.24
So he was one of those guys.

83
00:07:12.24 --> 00:07:17.04
And another interesting thing at a time when the Royals all over Europe and the world

84
00:07:17.04 --> 00:07:19.88
when they kind of flaunted their riches, he wasn't like that.

85
00:07:19.88 --> 00:07:22.04
He was kind of like a low profile guy.

86
00:07:22.04 --> 00:07:23.36
He allowed free speech.

87
00:07:23.36 --> 00:07:27.28
He allowed people to even insult him, which was, you know, I mean, obviously his old man

88
00:07:27.28 --> 00:07:30.68
didn't have any problem just tossing out the death sentence.

89
00:07:30.68 --> 00:07:34.36
But there was a story about him where there was like a poster hung up that somebody

90
00:07:34.36 --> 00:07:38.36
had done a drawing that made him kind of look like a buffoon.

91
00:07:38.36 --> 00:07:40.68
And he was going through this village where this thing was hung up.

92
00:07:40.68 --> 00:07:43.20
And he kind of went to see what all this commotion, all these people around.

93
00:07:43.20 --> 00:07:45.80
He went to see what all the commotion was about.

94
00:07:45.80 --> 00:07:48.84
And he saw this sign hanging up on a post.

95
00:07:48.84 --> 00:07:52.92
And his comment was, hey, lower that sign down a little bit so people don't hurt their

96
00:07:52.92 --> 00:07:54.40
next while they're looking at us.

97
00:07:54.40 --> 00:07:56.32
So he's one of those guys.

98
00:07:56.32 --> 00:08:00.32
And you know, so we kind of had a Z ego in Czech, which is, which is definitely good.

99
00:08:00.32 --> 00:08:04.08
And his, his tactics, like I said, I mean, there's still even when you had these rigid

100
00:08:04.08 --> 00:08:08.96
sort of ranks in battles, you still had to maneuver the out, the elements around, the

101
00:08:08.96 --> 00:08:14.88
battlefield and his tactics were based in mobility and being able to move quickly, be

102
00:08:14.88 --> 00:08:17.24
able to move more quickly than the enemy.

103
00:08:17.24 --> 00:08:19.48
And he focused on drill and more drilling.

104
00:08:19.48 --> 00:08:23.000
And this is another interesting thing.

105
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.40
In his opinion, he, because drill, I don't know if you know this, but when we say drill

106
00:08:27.40 --> 00:08:32.28
in the military, we're talking about, you ever seen like a drill team with the rifles

107
00:08:32.28 --> 00:08:33.60
and they march and everything's perfect.

108
00:08:33.60 --> 00:08:35.000
A few of the men at the beginning.

109
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.16
Remember that movie?

110
00:08:36.16 --> 00:08:38.16
At the beginning, it's a cool, everyone's important.

111
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:39.16
Like, that's what it is.

112
00:08:39.16 --> 00:08:40.16
I can't remember that.

113
00:08:40.16 --> 00:08:43.28
I've definitely seen the movie, but I can't remember that particular part.

114
00:08:43.28 --> 00:08:44.28
But yeah, that's what drill is.

115
00:08:44.28 --> 00:08:47.20
So when people talk about drill, that's what they're talking about.

116
00:08:47.20 --> 00:08:55.68
And he was sent, he was of the opinion that people often misstook drill for the art of

117
00:08:55.68 --> 00:08:56.68
war.

118
00:08:56.68 --> 00:08:58.24
He's no, they're two different things.

119
00:08:58.24 --> 00:08:59.24
And they're important.

120
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:01.12
And there's a reason why you do drill.

121
00:09:01.12 --> 00:09:02.68
And it teaches you certain things.

122
00:09:02.68 --> 00:09:03.92
It teaches you a lot about discipline.

123
00:09:03.92 --> 00:09:06.08
It teaches you about responding to orders quickly.

124
00:09:06.08 --> 00:09:06.92
It teaches you how to work together.

125
00:09:06.92 --> 00:09:07.92
It's teams.

126
00:09:07.92 --> 00:09:13.000
So there's definitely a reason for drill, but that is not the art of war at all.

127
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.72
So at age 35, he was, he had been sick and he was recovering from an illness, but he was,

128
00:09:19.72 --> 00:09:21.000
I guess, still a little bit down.

129
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.60
So he was doing what he could.

130
00:09:22.60 --> 00:09:28.52
And in this case, it meant that he wrote down some of his principles.

131
00:09:28.52 --> 00:09:35.32
And the first version of it was called the instruction of Frederick the Great to his generals.

132
00:09:35.32 --> 00:09:38.44
And that piece was kind of revised.

133
00:09:38.44 --> 00:09:44.24
And the title was eventually changed to general principles of war.

134
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:49.56
And we're going to look at that book today and see what we can learn from Frederick the

135
00:09:49.56 --> 00:09:50.56
Great.

136
00:09:50.56 --> 00:09:56.04
And I was actually, I'm always surprised at how much I have to learn and how much I can

137
00:09:56.04 --> 00:10:00.96
learn from people that fought several hundred years ago and led several hundred years

138
00:10:00.96 --> 00:10:01.96
ago.

139
00:10:01.96 --> 00:10:03.96
It's amazing.

140
00:10:03.96 --> 00:10:04.96
It's amazing.

141
00:10:04.96 --> 00:10:06.76
What you can learn from these folks.

142
00:10:06.76 --> 00:10:07.76
All right.

143
00:10:07.76 --> 00:10:09.32
Here we go.

144
00:10:09.32 --> 00:10:12.04
Going to the book.

145
00:10:12.04 --> 00:10:18.32
This section is called the capabilities of crushing troops and their particular merit.

146
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:23.48
The greatest force of the Prussian army resides in their wonderful regularity, which

147
00:10:23.48 --> 00:10:27.52
long custom has made a habit.

148
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:36.40
In exact obedience and in the bravery of the troops, the discipline of these troops, now

149
00:10:36.40 --> 00:10:42.52
evolved into habit, has such effect that in the greatest confusion of an action and the

150
00:10:42.52 --> 00:10:49.96
most evident perils, their disorder is still more orderly than the good order of their enemies.

151
00:10:49.96 --> 00:10:51.76
So there you go.

152
00:10:51.76 --> 00:10:58.000
This is this is discipline equals freedom in whatever 17 something.

153
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.24
If you think about what he's saying, his troops were so disciplined that even when

154
00:11:01.24 --> 00:11:07.40
there's total chaos going on, in their worst state, they still are more square

155
00:11:07.40 --> 00:11:12.48
away than the enemies because they're discipline is so strong.

156
00:11:12.48 --> 00:11:18.60
Back to the book, consequently, small confusions are redressed in a moment and all evolutions

157
00:11:18.60 --> 00:11:19.60
are made promptly.

158
00:11:19.60 --> 00:11:21.56
It doesn't matter what you do to confuse them.

159
00:11:21.56 --> 00:11:22.56
No problem.

160
00:11:22.56 --> 00:11:24.20
We got discipline.

161
00:11:24.20 --> 00:11:29.48
A general of other troops could be surprised in circumstances in which he would not be

162
00:11:29.48 --> 00:11:31.80
if commanding questions.

163
00:11:31.80 --> 00:11:37.84
Since he will find resources in the speed with which they form and maneuver in the presence

164
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:39.44
of the enemy.

165
00:11:39.44 --> 00:11:46.06
And this is something that I say all the time, was that like in a seal platoon, in my seal

166
00:11:46.06 --> 00:11:52.60
platoon, in my seal task unit, in an army or a Marine Corps infantry platoon, the discipline

167
00:11:52.60 --> 00:11:56.08
that they have gives them more freedom on the battlefield because they can react to things

168
00:11:56.08 --> 00:11:57.08
quicker.

169
00:11:57.08 --> 00:11:59.72
Exactly what we're talking about.

170
00:11:59.72 --> 00:12:00.72
Exactly.

171
00:12:00.72 --> 00:12:01.72
Exactly.

172
00:12:01.72 --> 00:12:02.72
The great realized.

173
00:12:02.72 --> 00:12:07.12
Back to the book, Prussians, Discipline, renders these troops capable of executing the most

174
00:12:07.12 --> 00:12:11.64
difficult maneuvers, such as traversing a wood and battle without losing their files or

175
00:12:11.64 --> 00:12:16.68
distances, advancing in close order at double time, forming with promptness, reversing

176
00:12:16.68 --> 00:12:20.72
their directions suddenly to fall on the flank of the enemy, gaining an advantage by

177
00:12:20.72 --> 00:12:28.000
a forced march and finally in surpassing the enemy in constant sea and fortitude.

178
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.32
Discipline equals freedom.

179
00:12:29.32 --> 00:12:31.76
I'm glad he didn't use that title.

180
00:12:31.76 --> 00:12:33.04
He could have.

181
00:12:33.04 --> 00:12:34.04
He could have.

182
00:12:34.04 --> 00:12:36.04
Now he's got something in here.

183
00:12:36.04 --> 00:12:44.48
And when I initially read this part, I was like, well, that's a little bit off of my thoughts,

184
00:12:44.48 --> 00:12:48.04
but he comes back to it later and will get to that part.

185
00:12:48.04 --> 00:12:51.56
I mean, actually, when he gets to this part talking about decentralized command, because

186
00:12:51.56 --> 00:12:56.44
he retox about something that's a little bit opposite of what I usually say.

187
00:12:56.44 --> 00:12:57.60
So here we go back to the book.

188
00:12:57.60 --> 00:13:03.68
Obedience to the officers and subordination is so exact that no one ever questions an order.

189
00:13:03.68 --> 00:13:09.04
Hours are observed exactly and however little a general knows how to make himself obeyed,

190
00:13:09.04 --> 00:13:11.40
he is always sure to be.

191
00:13:11.40 --> 00:13:14.44
No one ever reasons about the possibility of an enterprise.

192
00:13:14.44 --> 00:13:17.52
And finally, it's accomplishment is never disparate of.

193
00:13:17.52 --> 00:13:20.52
So what he's saying there is like everyone just listens to me.

194
00:13:20.52 --> 00:13:23.32
That's what everyone just listens.

195
00:13:23.32 --> 00:13:26.12
And no one questions the orders.

196
00:13:26.12 --> 00:13:28.68
And we're going to get to later where he actually, there's two things.

197
00:13:28.68 --> 00:13:31.36
Number one, he really takes care of his people.

198
00:13:31.36 --> 00:13:34.12
So they listen to him because he takes care of him.

199
00:13:34.12 --> 00:13:35.76
It's not because he barks orders of him.

200
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:38.80
It's not, it's that he really cares about them and he takes care of them.

201
00:13:38.80 --> 00:13:42.92
And the other thing he talks, and he'll talk later about this is how getting input from

202
00:13:42.92 --> 00:13:45.28
people is important.

203
00:13:45.28 --> 00:13:49.76
So even though he lays that out there, I think that's almost like a little macho.

204
00:13:49.76 --> 00:13:51.76
He's throwing some macho.

205
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:55.12
Hey, look at me, everyone just listens to me.

206
00:13:55.12 --> 00:13:58.72
That's the way to, I don't know if you noticed this when we had Colonel Fife on the podcast.

207
00:13:58.72 --> 00:14:02.36
And I was talking about this with Dave Burke the other day.

208
00:14:02.36 --> 00:14:08.08
When we first were talking with Colonel Fife, he was saying, yeah, well, everyone just

209
00:14:08.08 --> 00:14:09.48
did what I told him to do.

210
00:14:09.48 --> 00:14:13.80
Now it's kind of like, wow, that, I always say that that doesn't really work.

211
00:14:13.80 --> 00:14:16.16
I don't want something to think about this to myself.

212
00:14:16.16 --> 00:14:18.04
He says, yeah, people just don't want to do it.

213
00:14:18.04 --> 00:14:19.04
They do it.

214
00:14:19.04 --> 00:14:22.32
That's what made my group, my unit so good.

215
00:14:22.32 --> 00:14:24.04
And I was like, wow.

216
00:14:24.04 --> 00:14:25.32
And then he went into it.

217
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:28.28
And when he went into it, all the answers were there.

218
00:14:28.28 --> 00:14:29.28
He was like, no, no, no, no.

219
00:14:29.28 --> 00:14:30.92
I cared about my guys.

220
00:14:30.92 --> 00:14:32.52
And then he went into, I don't know if you remember this.

221
00:14:32.52 --> 00:14:36.12
He went into this part about where he said, look, if you're in a tank and you tell someone

222
00:14:36.12 --> 00:14:40.04
to get out of the tank, when the tanks are hitting bullets are hitting the tank, yeah, and

223
00:14:40.04 --> 00:14:41.04
go fix the track.

224
00:14:41.04 --> 00:14:42.04
You think they're going to do that?

225
00:14:42.04 --> 00:14:43.04
Just could you tell them to?

226
00:14:43.04 --> 00:14:46.64
Not, not if you don't take care of not if they don't say, so even though he initially

227
00:14:46.64 --> 00:14:49.60
said kind of like what Frederick the greatest, hey, people are just going to listen to

228
00:14:49.60 --> 00:14:50.60
me.

229
00:14:50.60 --> 00:14:56.04
Both saying the same kind of thing, but both of them have a lot more depth behind that reaction

230
00:14:56.04 --> 00:14:57.44
from their troops.

231
00:14:57.44 --> 00:15:02.24
So when, whenever somebody hears something like that, it's like, no, it's not true.

232
00:15:02.24 --> 00:15:04.92
It doesn't work as a matter of fact, there's a chapter in the new book coming out

233
00:15:04.92 --> 00:15:06.32
that late for my wrote.

234
00:15:06.32 --> 00:15:09.04
And Dave's talking about this one CEO that we're working with.

235
00:15:09.04 --> 00:15:13.000
That's kind of like quoting Patton, like discipline is the ultimate.

236
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.04
And same thing, Dave's talking the guy like, hey, that's not the way the military works.

237
00:15:18.04 --> 00:15:22.68
And he believed that when he would hear this kind of thing, this is like a macho thing to

238
00:15:22.68 --> 00:15:23.68
say, right?

239
00:15:23.68 --> 00:15:24.68
Is that the right word?

240
00:15:24.68 --> 00:15:25.68
I don't know if that's the right word.

241
00:15:25.68 --> 00:15:27.12
It's a, it's a bold statement.

242
00:15:27.12 --> 00:15:29.52
Hey, my troops just listen to me.

243
00:15:29.52 --> 00:15:30.52
Right?

244
00:15:30.52 --> 00:15:31.72
It's not true.

245
00:15:31.72 --> 00:15:33.000
There's so much more depth.

246
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.24
And that makes that actually happen.

247
00:15:36.24 --> 00:15:44.08
All right, going back to the book, the Prussians are superior to their enemies in

248
00:15:44.08 --> 00:15:50.76
Constancy, since the officers who have no other profession nor other fortune to hope

249
00:15:50.76 --> 00:15:58.40
from accept their arms, animate themselves with ambition and a gallantry beyond all test.

250
00:15:58.40 --> 00:16:01.24
The soldier has a confidence in himself.

251
00:16:01.24 --> 00:16:05.04
Because he makes it a point of honor to never give way.

252
00:16:05.04 --> 00:16:12.04
So I just, we were working with a company doing a, doing an FTX training.

253
00:16:12.04 --> 00:16:14.64
You know, so we're out in the field.

254
00:16:14.64 --> 00:16:17.20
And I was talking about cover move.

255
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:22.32
And I said, if you're walking while you're covering your field of fire from a level of

256
00:16:22.32 --> 00:16:24.60
one to ten, how well can you do it?

257
00:16:24.60 --> 00:16:26.16
Any other people, like I don't know five, six.

258
00:16:26.16 --> 00:16:28.88
Because when you're walking, you can't really, you know, you got to look where you're

259
00:16:28.88 --> 00:16:30.52
walking or look where everyone else is doing.

260
00:16:30.52 --> 00:16:32.44
You, you can't just look at your field of fire.

261
00:16:32.44 --> 00:16:35.000
You can't just look at your field of fire, which is where you're looking for threats.

262
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.68
I said, when you do cover move and you stop and you get behind some cover and then you

263
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:43.88
just your whole job is just to look, how good you do one to ten.

264
00:16:43.88 --> 00:16:44.88
And everyone's like ten.

265
00:16:44.88 --> 00:16:46.88
And I said, yeah.

266
00:16:46.88 --> 00:16:50.52
And that's kind of the same thing here where you get this guy.

267
00:16:50.52 --> 00:16:53.60
When you have people that their whole life is just dedicated to one thing.

268
00:16:53.60 --> 00:16:55.92
Well, then they're going to do it good.

269
00:16:55.92 --> 00:17:01.56
These, these, these, uh, crushing officers who had nothing else going for them other than

270
00:17:01.56 --> 00:17:02.56
being in the military.

271
00:17:02.56 --> 00:17:03.56
Yeah.

272
00:17:03.56 --> 00:17:08.68
So that's why I was looking at people asking me, should I start another job, all

273
00:17:08.68 --> 00:17:10.88
of my active duty?

274
00:17:10.88 --> 00:17:13.36
And quite frankly, my answer is no.

275
00:17:13.36 --> 00:17:19.12
It's, if you do, it's got to be so on the side that it doesn't interfere at all with

276
00:17:19.12 --> 00:17:23.42
your job as being, uh, being in the military.

277
00:17:23.42 --> 00:17:25.28
It's just too hard to balance two things.

278
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:26.28
Can you give a little advice?

279
00:17:26.28 --> 00:17:27.74
Can you maybe set something up on the side?

280
00:17:27.74 --> 00:17:31.68
Yeah, but dedicate focus on, focus on what you're doing a hundred percent.

281
00:17:31.68 --> 00:17:33.16
There's nothing else that I don't know.

282
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:38.32
I just don't, I don't see that as working out very well.

283
00:17:38.32 --> 00:17:40.52
I say, just focus on what you're doing.

284
00:17:40.52 --> 00:17:42.12
That's my opinion.

285
00:17:42.12 --> 00:17:44.36
Some people pull it off.

286
00:17:44.36 --> 00:17:46.36
I've never known anyone that pulled it off.

287
00:17:46.36 --> 00:17:47.88
Well, maybe I could think of some.

288
00:17:47.88 --> 00:17:53.48
Most people that had some kind of side gig going on, the military was their side gig

289
00:17:53.48 --> 00:17:55.72
to, you know, they weren't just in the game.

290
00:17:55.72 --> 00:17:56.72
Yeah.

291
00:17:56.72 --> 00:17:57.72
They, they, they, they, they, yeah.

292
00:17:57.72 --> 00:17:59.92
It's like, no, do your job.

293
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:00.92
Yeah.

294
00:18:00.92 --> 00:18:01.92
Do it well.

295
00:18:01.92 --> 00:18:02.92
Yeah.

296
00:18:02.92 --> 00:18:06.80
You know, that doesn't go with if you're working for some corporation.

297
00:18:06.80 --> 00:18:07.76
Then you can pull it off, right?

298
00:18:07.76 --> 00:18:10.84
You can do something on the side, depends on the job.

299
00:18:10.84 --> 00:18:11.84
But I don't know.

300
00:18:11.84 --> 00:18:15.56
It seems like if you're the boss of, let's say you had a team, right?

301
00:18:15.56 --> 00:18:19.08
They're like, you know, their, you know, productivity, you know, all this stuff.

302
00:18:19.08 --> 00:18:23.14
And then you find out one team member is basically splitting his time, you know, I don't

303
00:18:23.14 --> 00:18:24.38
know, doing something else.

304
00:18:24.38 --> 00:18:25.94
It's kind of like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

305
00:18:25.94 --> 00:18:30.14
If we're here, China, if it's interfering, but most jobs aren't twenty four hours to,

306
00:18:30.14 --> 00:18:31.74
it's not really even true.

307
00:18:31.74 --> 00:18:37.58
Yeah, you know what? I think you can pull it off. You can pull off way easier in any other job than in the military

308
00:18:37.98 --> 00:18:39.74
You can have something going on on this side

309
00:18:39.98 --> 00:18:43.90
Yeah, because the military's the the job where it's like yeah 24 hours a day

310
00:18:44.46 --> 00:18:45.50
Yeah

311
00:18:45.50 --> 00:18:47.98
Are you think are you saying in a combat scenario?

312
00:18:47.98 --> 00:18:50.70
We're talking about just in general, you know just in general

313
00:18:51.10 --> 00:18:53.74
And I shouldn't say that you know there's a lot of jobs when I work with companies

314
00:18:53.74 --> 00:18:58.62
There's people that are they're doing 24 hours a day. They're in the game. Yeah, so if you're in one of those kind of jobs

315
00:18:58.62 --> 00:19:00.86
Don't get a side job and aren't they like or

316
00:19:00.86 --> 00:19:05.02
Self-approach that you can do it. It's hard to pull off them. It's hard to pull off

317
00:19:05.02 --> 00:19:08.14
But our job's in the military that are that are pretty mellow

318
00:19:08.14 --> 00:19:11.42
They're all where you can come in you can come in. Yeah, you know, they're us

319
00:19:11.42 --> 00:19:15.50
So it gets kind of like if you're doing that baby you can do it. Yeah, you're thinking of you like you're

320
00:19:15.90 --> 00:19:19.34
Yeah, but I'm also thinking about like guys and guys in this he'll teams yeah

321
00:19:19.34 --> 00:19:22.22
That's what the guys in this he'll times that had some kind of side hustle going on

322
00:19:22.78 --> 00:19:26.94
Generally they weren't fully in the game, you know, that's just the way it is

323
00:19:27.10 --> 00:19:29.10
Maybe there's some guys that I didn't even know about

324
00:19:29.10 --> 00:19:33.98
Yeah, that did it but most people like hey if you're out buying houses in flipping houses

325
00:19:33.98 --> 00:19:39.02
You know you can kind of do that when you're in the military because you're doing some hard work on the weekends

326
00:19:39.02 --> 00:19:43.10
And that's cool get a little rental property going hey right on I did that

327
00:19:43.42 --> 00:19:47.90
Yeah, but it wasn't it wasn't it literally interfered zero

328
00:19:48.78 --> 00:19:50.78
With my primary job, which was getting off

329
00:19:53.50 --> 00:19:58.54
All right back to the book many have been seen to fight even when wound did since the organization in general

330
00:19:58.54 --> 00:20:05.18
Proud of its past brave engagements considers that any soldier who is shown the least cowardice

331
00:20:05.74 --> 00:20:07.74
Inaction a front sit

332
00:20:08.70 --> 00:20:12.62
Like that so you have that attitude you have that

333
00:20:13.50 --> 00:20:15.98
That culture inside your organization. It's a real thing

334
00:20:16.70 --> 00:20:19.18
We don't back down we keep fighting hard

335
00:20:20.06 --> 00:20:21.50
That's what we do

336
00:20:21.50 --> 00:20:25.10
All right now we talk a little bit about projects of campaign

337
00:20:25.10 --> 00:20:34.46
One should know ones enemies their alliances their resources and the nature of their country in order to plan a campaign

338
00:20:35.34 --> 00:20:37.82
One should know what to expect of one's friends

339
00:20:38.38 --> 00:20:47.98
What resources one has oneself and see the future effects to determine what one has to fear or hope from political maneuvers

340
00:20:49.34 --> 00:20:51.34
We've heard this over and over again

341
00:20:51.34 --> 00:20:53.34
Understand your enemy

342
00:20:56.30 --> 00:21:00.46
Back to the book extravagant projects of campaign are worthless

343
00:21:00.46 --> 00:21:06.30
I call extravagant those which require you to make penetrations or those which reduce you to a

344
00:21:07.02 --> 00:21:09.02
To-a-to-rigid defense

345
00:21:09.02 --> 00:21:13.90
Penetrations are worthless because in pushing too far into the enemy's country you weaken yourself

346
00:21:15.02 --> 00:21:20.54
Your communications become very difficult to maintain on account of their length and in order to make a

347
00:21:20.54 --> 00:21:28.14
Shured conquest. It is necessary always to proceed within the rules and here's the rules to advance

348
00:21:29.26 --> 00:21:32.62
Establish yourself silently to advance again

349
00:21:33.34 --> 00:21:36.94
to establish yourself the same and always to prepare

350
00:21:37.66 --> 00:21:43.58
to have within your reach of your army your resources and your requirements so there he's saying

351
00:21:43.58 --> 00:21:51.02
And make sure you're ready and if you've got to extend yourself don't extend yourself too far

352
00:21:51.42 --> 00:21:55.18
That's that's what he's saying that's that's very good advice

353
00:21:57.10 --> 00:22:01.58
Now he also says this no, so that's going on the offense now. There's a dichotomy here

354
00:22:02.30 --> 00:22:04.62
Which we talk about dichotomy a lot

355
00:22:05.26 --> 00:22:08.38
There's a dichotomy here because he's saying hey look you got to be careful going on super

356
00:22:08.38 --> 00:22:14.30
Super far distant offense and extending yourself too far but then he says this back to the book

357
00:22:14.86 --> 00:22:18.62
Projects of absolute defensive are not practical

358
00:22:19.50 --> 00:22:23.90
Because while wishing to close yourself in strong camps the enemy will

359
00:22:24.14 --> 00:22:30.94
Invele up you to preview of your sustenance from the rear and to blind you to lose ground while disheartening your troops

360
00:22:30.94 --> 00:22:37.10
So while you're digging in guess what the enemy's gonna maneuver on you and cut and cut you off now back to the book I prefer

361
00:22:38.30 --> 00:22:43.66
To this conduct of the offensive with the hazard of losing the battle

362
00:22:44.46 --> 00:22:51.18
Since this will not be more fatal then you're retreat and your timid defensive so he's saying there

363
00:22:51.18 --> 00:23:00.38
He'd rather be aggressive be lean towards being me at more aggressive than leading towards being more defensive and he and he says why in the one

364
00:23:01.26 --> 00:23:06.06
You lose ground by withdrawing and soldiers by desertion and you have no hope

365
00:23:06.22 --> 00:23:11.82
So if you go on the defense that's what happens you lose ground you lose soldiers and you have no hope

366
00:23:12.70 --> 00:23:17.98
Jada now on the offense he says in the other you do not risk more and

367
00:23:17.98 --> 00:23:23.66
If you are fortunate you can hope for the most brilliant success. What is he saying there attack?

368
00:23:24.22 --> 00:23:25.82
That's what he's saying I

369
00:23:26.22 --> 00:23:28.22
agree with that

370
00:23:28.78 --> 00:23:34.78
Again, there's a dichotomy there because he's saying attack, but the the previous paragraph he's saying don't over extend yourself

371
00:23:35.50 --> 00:23:39.34
This is why we write in a book called the dichotomy leadership because you have to find that balance

372
00:23:40.54 --> 00:23:42.54
All right

373
00:23:42.54 --> 00:23:49.66
Back to the book. I am now coming to what I call the defensive which turns into the offensive the greatest

374
00:23:49.82 --> 00:23:55.74
Secret of war and the masterpiece of a skillful general is to starve his enemy

375
00:23:57.10 --> 00:24:04.94
Hunger exhaust men more surely than courage and you will succeed with less risk than by fighting

376
00:24:04.94 --> 00:24:13.18
But since it is very rare that a war is ended by the capture of a depot and matters are only decided by great battles

377
00:24:13.58 --> 00:24:19.10
It is necessary to employ all these means to attain this object

378
00:24:21.98 --> 00:24:27.34
Starving your enemy. You don't know it's the interestingly. You don't know what's thinking about when that pop into my mind

379
00:24:28.70 --> 00:24:29.98
Is

380
00:24:29.98 --> 00:24:38.70
When you're when you're dealing with relationships one of the best ways to like win in a relationship scenario

381
00:24:39.42 --> 00:24:41.42
Is you starve the other person of attention

382
00:24:42.62 --> 00:24:44.62
What do you mean? So

383
00:24:44.94 --> 00:24:51.34
Two two yeah to win so like when you what's the worst thing you can do to your kid when your kid is doing something bad

384
00:24:52.78 --> 00:24:57.42
Give it attention yeah, the worst thing you can do is yeah, as give it attention the best thing you can do is

385
00:24:57.42 --> 00:25:04.38
Starving of attention. Yeah, I just thought that was kind of interesting and another thing is like in jujitsu

386
00:25:06.46 --> 00:25:11.58
You're you starve the person of energy right you you make them use their energy and once they're out of energy. They're done

387
00:25:11.58 --> 00:25:13.58
Yeah, yeah

388
00:25:15.02 --> 00:25:21.26
Yes, I guess it depends on what you mean by win the relationship. Yeah, I guess I didn't really phrase that correctly, but I was thinking of

389
00:25:22.62 --> 00:25:24.62
What we generally do

390
00:25:24.62 --> 00:25:30.38
When we clarify that I think I just figured it out a little bit what we generally do is if we've got a problem in relationship

391
00:25:30.38 --> 00:25:32.70
What do we do we go to fight it go to war?

392
00:25:33.34 --> 00:25:35.98
The better thing maybe just to starve

393
00:25:35.98 --> 00:25:39.18
Starvitt a little bit how do you start it start it from attention right?

394
00:25:39.18 --> 00:25:41.50
I think we talked about I think it was last week

395
00:25:42.46 --> 00:25:45.58
There's someone called asked like how do you get vengeance and I was like

396
00:25:45.58 --> 00:25:47.74
Maybe the best thing the best vengeance to give us

397
00:25:47.98 --> 00:25:51.90
Starvim of attention. Yeah, don't even give it to them. Yeah, you're gonna that's the win

398
00:25:51.90 --> 00:25:56.30
Yeah, so I guess it's not good to put that in perspective with your kids right?

399
00:25:56.30 --> 00:26:03.42
Really not a good thing any battles the naryl interrelation chips sure like yeah, I think yeah, and you could definitely

400
00:26:04.54 --> 00:26:10.22
Go too far with that. Oh, yeah, yeah, so no. I'm not saying starv. I guess if you're if you're talking about

401
00:26:11.82 --> 00:26:17.82
I guess more than anything else. I'm gonna even say it's good or bad. I'm saying it's something to be aware of that you can use attention

402
00:26:17.82 --> 00:26:33.90
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

403
00:26:33.90 --> 00:26:35.90
They attention to your kids

404
00:26:35.90 --> 00:26:38.38
Because when you say relationship you automatically assume

405
00:26:39.02 --> 00:26:40.62
wife kids

406
00:26:40.62 --> 00:26:45.98
Girlfriend boyfriend in a thing. I don't automatically assume that yeah, well, I think it's like yeah, okay

407
00:26:45.98 --> 00:26:54.14
In any any battle situation we're like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just saying it's another tool

408
00:26:54.62 --> 00:26:57.66
Yeah, it's a good one. Yeah, it's a good one. It is a good one

409
00:26:59.26 --> 00:27:05.26
All right here he talks about and and by the way, obviously I'm cutting out big chunks and what's interesting is

410
00:27:06.78 --> 00:27:08.78
He talks about heat for each one of these

411
00:27:08.78 --> 00:27:17.50
Little principles that he talks about he actually goes through specific historical battles that happened and how they unfolded but

412
00:27:18.46 --> 00:27:22.14
If you want to read those you should get the book, but

413
00:27:25.50 --> 00:27:31.90
I wanted to get through all the principles so here we go. It's kind of skipping the the battles and his his battles

414
00:27:31.90 --> 00:27:36.54
They're not they're not like these first person kind of accounts that are really moving they're more

415
00:27:36.54 --> 00:27:42.22
Just historical perspective hey here's and he wasn't even at all out all of them

416
00:27:42.22 --> 00:27:45.50
You know some of he said this is what happened in this place and this is what happened in this other place

417
00:27:46.38 --> 00:27:48.38
Are you talking here about rest camps

418
00:27:49.02 --> 00:27:53.18
The duty of the general in these sort of camps is to restore his army and

419
00:27:53.18 --> 00:28:04.94
Personally to oversee order and discipline the cavalry and infantry should be visited often and examine to determine if the first is well-nurged and if these two cores are complete

420
00:28:07.34 --> 00:28:09.34
So take care of your people

421
00:28:09.34 --> 00:28:12.54
Likewise the troops should be exercised frequently

422
00:28:13.02 --> 00:28:16.62
Cavalry as well as infantry and the general should be

423
00:28:17.02 --> 00:28:22.70
Should often be present to praise the ones to criticize the others and to see with his own eyes

424
00:28:22.70 --> 00:28:28.54
That the orders which are found in my institution military are observed exactly

425
00:28:30.46 --> 00:28:36.22
The camp guards should be visited to see if they are vigilant if the officer's attentive or if he is

426
00:28:36.22 --> 00:28:42.86
Negligent to be extremely strict so that the mounted centuries will not allow anyone to enter the camp without

427
00:28:43.10 --> 00:28:47.18
Examining and announcing him and to prevent desertion by all means

428
00:28:47.90 --> 00:28:50.54
That I have indicated previously. He talks about

429
00:28:50.54 --> 00:28:55.66
One of the problems they have is people deserting and he goes into how do you stop people from deserting and it's

430
00:28:56.78 --> 00:29:01.74
That's what he's referring to there things that keep in everyone busy making sure that they're well fed

431
00:29:01.74 --> 00:29:04.06
He talks about those kind of things so that's what he's referring to

432
00:29:06.62 --> 00:29:14.46
God exercise frequently gotta keep busy and you have to inspect you have to get eyes on he says with your own eyes

433
00:29:14.54 --> 00:29:18.94
So when you're the leader you just can't throw that order out there and expect it's all gonna happen the way you expected it to

434
00:29:18.94 --> 00:29:20.94
Not gonna happen you gotta go expected with your own eyes

435
00:29:23.26 --> 00:29:28.54
Back to the book no, before I go back to the book he's gonna talk about

436
00:29:30.46 --> 00:29:36.70
How important it is to understand the battlefield and the terrain here we go knowledge of the country

437
00:29:37.26 --> 00:29:44.06
Is to a general what a rifle is to an infantryman and what the rules of arithmetic are to a geomactrition

438
00:29:44.06 --> 00:29:55.26
If he does not know the country he will do nothing but make gross mistakes without this without this knowledge his projects

439
00:29:55.74 --> 00:30:00.70
Be them otherwise admirable become ridiculous and often impracticable

440
00:30:02.14 --> 00:30:06.14
Therefore study the country where you are going to act

441
00:30:06.14 --> 00:30:15.94
When it's desired to apply oneself to this essential part of war the most detailed and exact maps of the country that can be found are taken in examined and

442
00:30:16.22 --> 00:30:18.22
re-examined frequently

443
00:30:18.22 --> 00:30:26.62
If it is not in time of war the places are visited camps are chosen roads are examined the mayors of the villages the butchers and the farmers are

444
00:30:26.62 --> 00:30:30.70
Talk to one becomes familiar with the footpaths and the depth of the wood

445
00:30:30.70 --> 00:30:36.06
Their nature and the depth of the rivers their practical marshes and

446
00:30:37.42 --> 00:30:46.94
Those which are not and one observes in this study to distinguish carefully between the conditions of the marshes and the streams in the different seasons of the year

447
00:30:48.46 --> 00:30:50.54
It cannot be said that a stream is

448
00:30:51.10 --> 00:30:55.10
impracticable in the month of August because it had been in the month of April

449
00:30:55.10 --> 00:31:03.34
The road is chosen to be taken on such and such a march the number of columns in which the march can be made and

450
00:31:03.58 --> 00:31:08.78
All the strong camping places found on the route are examined to see if they can be used

451
00:31:11.26 --> 00:31:13.26
Gather your intel

452
00:31:13.26 --> 00:31:15.26
Gather your intel

453
00:31:15.42 --> 00:31:17.42
This is critical

454
00:31:17.42 --> 00:31:20.62
on the battlefield and my first deployment

455
00:31:20.62 --> 00:31:29.50
To Iraq I didn't do this as much as I should have because we be going to a place for the first time and we go there

456
00:31:29.50 --> 00:31:31.50
We'd get a quick kind of

457
00:31:32.46 --> 00:31:36.62
Information intelligence would come in and we'd okay, we're gonna we find out what this guy is and we do a quick map study

458
00:31:37.90 --> 00:31:44.38
You know we do a map study, but it wasn't as thorough as as when we were in a body for six straight months and you actually just knew where you were

459
00:31:44.38 --> 00:31:51.58
I taught and I somebody just hit me up on Twitter talking about this, but there was a guy from the first the 506

460
00:31:51.58 --> 00:31:57.82
A company commander. He was awesome and he videoed he had video cameras in his humvies and so when he's out driving around Ramadi

461
00:31:58.70 --> 00:32:03.82
He would record it and then when he got back he just watched it over and over again so he knew every little detail

462
00:32:03.82 --> 00:32:14.78
Yeah, and that's what you want to do that it's so important to know where you are and understand the terrain

463
00:32:14.54 --> 00:32:18.46
Okay, now we're gonna talk about something it's it's a it's a French word

464
00:32:20.06 --> 00:32:24.70
And I don't speak French by the way, I dig it. I looked it up

465
00:32:25.34 --> 00:32:27.34
I'm still gonna murder it. I apologize

466
00:32:27.34 --> 00:32:33.82
Here it cool. It looks like poop do you oil but the way you actually say it is

467
00:32:34.14 --> 00:32:39.98
Cudeo okay, so Cudeo and it's actually used quite a bit so I had to like run a couple rehearsals on it. How do you spell it?

468
00:32:40.78 --> 00:32:47.50
Coup which which I knew that one right cool right there's a coup and then d apostrophe

469
00:32:48.06 --> 00:32:50.06
O-e-i-l

470
00:32:50.06 --> 00:32:56.62
Cudeo and sometimes they say that I could a but I like that that some people put a little on the end of it

471
00:32:56.62 --> 00:33:00.14
I like that because it's a little bit more distinct so that's what I'm doing okay

472
00:33:00.94 --> 00:33:02.94
And what that means it it

473
00:33:03.58 --> 00:33:09.82
It translates directly. I believe to stroke of the iron what it means is like a quick glance. Oh Cudeo

474
00:33:10.38 --> 00:33:13.90
So you just take a quick glance at something and you understand it think about the power of this

475
00:33:15.50 --> 00:33:21.74
The Cudeo of a general is the talent which great men have of conceiving in a moment all the

476
00:33:21.74 --> 00:33:27.18
Advantage of the terrain and the use that they can make of it with their army

477
00:33:28.54 --> 00:33:31.74
When you are accustomed to the size of your army you will soon

478
00:33:33.02 --> 00:33:38.38
You soon form your Cudeo with reference to it and habit teaches you the ground

479
00:33:39.34 --> 00:33:41.74
That you can occupy with a certain number of troops

480
00:33:42.22 --> 00:33:46.70
So what do you say there's you got a practice you got a practice practice practice and that's

481
00:33:46.70 --> 00:33:51.26
What makes you good at it you start to be able to size things up right?

482
00:33:51.90 --> 00:33:56.54
You start to look at situations and the more you get put in those situations the better you can size them

483
00:33:56.54 --> 00:33:58.54
Think about when you first started as a balancer

484
00:33:59.34 --> 00:34:04.22
Right when you first started as a balancer and you look at something and you might think oh what's this guy gonna do?

485
00:34:04.22 --> 00:34:06.22
I then a year how long will your balancer for?

486
00:34:06.70 --> 00:34:11.18
7 years. Okay, so by like the 6th year you're looking at situations like okay

487
00:34:11.18 --> 00:34:15.02
I can see that guy's gonna gotta get that guy out of here. You you just get better at your job

488
00:34:15.02 --> 00:34:19.66
Yeah, you're you're Kudeo you're way of just looking at things in a certain

489
00:34:19.66 --> 00:34:24.06
Get sharper. Yeah, that's very important. Sure

490
00:34:26.94 --> 00:34:32.14
Oh speaking of which back to the book the Kudeo is of great importance on two occasions

491
00:34:32.22 --> 00:34:37.82
The first is when you encounter the enemy on your march and are obliged to choose ground on which to fight instantly

492
00:34:37.82 --> 00:34:43.98
As I have remarked with a single square mile a hundred different orders of battle can be formed

493
00:34:46.46 --> 00:34:51.66
This is why you're her so this is also why you think you think about when you're patrolling

494
00:34:52.70 --> 00:34:56.14
You're looking around at the terrain and you're going okay if we get contact from over there

495
00:34:56.14 --> 00:34:59.42
We can go into this direction if we get contact from over there we can get covered behind this

496
00:35:00.06 --> 00:35:04.94
This berm or go behind this building if you're thinking about that even you go into

497
00:35:04.94 --> 00:35:09.66
Yeah, you go to restaurant you're like okay where the exits that's exactly what you're doing

498
00:35:09.66 --> 00:35:13.66
Where are the exits if someone comes in the front here's our emergency if someone comes in the back here's what I'm gonna do

499
00:35:14.86 --> 00:35:18.14
You just do a quick assessment. That's all I'm saying. Yeah little Kudeo. Yeah

500
00:35:19.26 --> 00:35:22.86
The clever general perceives the advantages of terrain instantly

501
00:35:23.50 --> 00:35:27.26
He gains advantage from the slightest hillock from a tiny marsh

502
00:35:27.50 --> 00:35:32.06
He advances or he advances or withdraws a wing to gain superiority

503
00:35:32.06 --> 00:35:39.90
He strengthens and eases either his left or his right moves ahead to the or to the rear and profits from the mirrorist

504
00:35:40.70 --> 00:35:42.46
Baguettelles

505
00:35:42.46 --> 00:35:44.46
Had to look that word up by the way

506
00:35:44.46 --> 00:35:48.38
What is baguettelles baguettelles it's something of little value

507
00:35:49.34 --> 00:35:51.34
So what he's saying is

508
00:35:51.34 --> 00:35:56.94
If you're good you look at even like a little baguettelles or something that's kind of meaningless and you can take advantage of it

509
00:35:56.94 --> 00:35:58.70
Yeah

510
00:35:58.70 --> 00:36:05.10
If you think about in jjitsu when a guy if you're good at jjitsu and a guy moves his arm just a little bit like a

511
00:36:05.10 --> 00:36:08.54
Crop I would say like across the center of their chest. Yes, if they do that

512
00:36:08.54 --> 00:36:12.14
That's only an inch right to be like here. I'm okay here. I'm not okay

513
00:36:12.70 --> 00:36:15.98
When you're good you can take advantage of that. That's a good example. I know

514
00:36:17.50 --> 00:36:19.50
So a little jjitsu an echo make you happy

515
00:36:22.30 --> 00:36:24.06
Back to the book the king the kuda ya

516
00:36:24.06 --> 00:36:29.42
Is required of the general when the enemy is found in position and must be attacked

517
00:36:30.22 --> 00:36:35.74
Whoever has the best kuda ya will perceive at first glance the weak spot of the enemy and attack him there

518
00:36:38.46 --> 00:36:41.18
The latter is a result of experience

519
00:36:44.86 --> 00:36:48.94
And you can only get experience through two things training or actual experience

520
00:36:49.34 --> 00:36:52.38
Talk about that at the master. Yes, like if you want to be good

521
00:36:52.38 --> 00:36:54.38
You can get good through experience

522
00:36:55.58 --> 00:37:03.26
Or you can get good through training now there's some things that only experience will give you you can really make up a lot of ground just from training

523
00:37:03.26 --> 00:37:05.90
Yeah, like I think good like realistic

524
00:37:05.90 --> 00:37:07.90
Oh, that's got a real skin

525
00:37:08.14 --> 00:37:11.98
That's what separates the old martial arts from the new martial arts

526
00:37:11.98 --> 00:37:16.86
There it does is the experience was close the experience didn't used to be close to a real fight

527
00:37:17.26 --> 00:37:21.18
Oh, the training yeah, yeah the old training experience didn't wasn't close to a real fight

528
00:37:21.18 --> 00:37:23.18
Yes, it was like kada and

529
00:37:23.34 --> 00:37:26.46
Remember those old things where it's like well when I hit you here

530
00:37:26.94 --> 00:37:32.78
It's going to cause this reaction 100% yeah, that's like part of the practice

531
00:37:32.78 --> 00:37:34.38
I know that's the been no

532
00:37:34.38 --> 00:37:37.74
You know let me teach you the reactions that you will have

533
00:37:38.86 --> 00:37:40.86
That's total

534
00:37:40.86 --> 00:37:46.38
An actual guard that's a good way to kind of eval good a good way to evaluate when someone's like okay

535
00:37:46.38 --> 00:37:51.18
This is all you deal with this attacker or whatever situation and then they demonstrate it and then

536
00:37:52.06 --> 00:37:58.94
It takes a big involvement in like big involvement from the attacker person, you know in the demonstrations like whoa

537
00:38:00.54 --> 00:38:03.26
That might not happen that might not happen

538
00:38:03.26 --> 00:38:09.90
I remember there was people teaching me that if you hit someone in the neck with like a karate chop straight up

539
00:38:09.90 --> 00:38:12.70
That would they were teaching me this if you hit someone in the neck

540
00:38:12.78 --> 00:38:14.78
It's gonna knock them out. That's what they were saying

541
00:38:14.78 --> 00:38:16.78
And those part of it that was part of the whole thing

542
00:38:17.42 --> 00:38:23.34
Hey, if you get him here boom and I was young and I didn't even know you did to at the time

543
00:38:23.50 --> 00:38:28.86
But I've been in a lot of fights when I was a kid. You know we were in the streets and I was like

544
00:38:28.86 --> 00:38:32.30
I don't think that's actually gonna work do it to me

545
00:38:34.30 --> 00:38:36.70
And the dudes karate chop and me in the neck

546
00:38:37.34 --> 00:38:39.34
You didn't have any

547
00:38:39.34 --> 00:38:40.34
Didn't do anything

548
00:38:40.34 --> 00:38:43.50
I mean, it doesn't give you a little flash. I mean it gives you a look like a little tiny

549
00:38:43.50 --> 00:38:47.02
But he's trying to knock me out now because I'm calling him out right? He's given it all

550
00:38:47.02 --> 00:38:49.02
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so

551
00:38:50.30 --> 00:38:52.30
They're debunked yeah

552
00:38:52.30 --> 00:38:56.46
debunked real quick you know those ones where the wait was it in the front?

553
00:38:56.46 --> 00:38:57.74
Yeah, right?

554
00:38:57.74 --> 00:39:02.14
Like the right side of the neck man side of the neck that's gonna knock you out. He told me

555
00:39:02.30 --> 00:39:08.62
Yeah, you know those ones where it could be the same thing where they hit they do it. It's like a karate chop or so and the hitch

556
00:39:08.62 --> 00:39:12.62
But it's little bit in the front of your neck and I always see it

557
00:39:12.62 --> 00:39:17.02
I've never seen it in real life. Well, they do it and they hit you right there and the guy knocks out

558
00:39:17.18 --> 00:39:21.74
That's not true bro. It's so that's okay. I've never seen it right

559
00:39:21.74 --> 00:39:27.10
I'll Joe Rogan Joe Rogan's post something that's like fake works arts and

560
00:39:28.38 --> 00:39:33.02
And those are slapstick. Yeah, I know but he's like I could literally post these all day long

561
00:39:33.02 --> 00:39:35.02
Is there somebody that's not there?

562
00:39:35.02 --> 00:39:38.38
They're kind of funny. Yeah, it's weird though when you start talking about how

563
00:39:38.38 --> 00:39:43.10
It went you get you first came around and people had been training in you know

564
00:39:43.10 --> 00:39:47.98
Ons whatever traditional martial art for 20 years and

565
00:39:48.94 --> 00:39:52.70
All of a sudden like a white belt or a blue belt and you're too. Come and wrap them up now

566
00:39:52.70 --> 00:40:00.94
I will say this if I trained whatever some traditional martial art and it's 1986 and you and I get in a fight

567
00:40:01.50 --> 00:40:05.50
Yeah, you don't know anything. Yeah, you're gonna be in trouble because I at least know how to throw a punch

568
00:40:05.50 --> 00:40:07.50
Yeah, possibly yeah possibly

569
00:40:09.42 --> 00:40:13.50
Well, I mean there's advantages to hitting mitts. You know like you're because it's like

570
00:40:13.50 --> 00:40:16.78
Yeah, you know how it feels to land a punch that spatial kind of

571
00:40:16.78 --> 00:40:19.90
Anaccharide. Yes, do you have you develop learn how to develop power or?

572
00:40:20.30 --> 00:40:24.14
We're talking about boxing. That's a whole different story because that's a real martial art and if you watch people change

573
00:40:24.14 --> 00:40:26.14
You're gonna get knocked out sometimes

574
00:40:26.46 --> 00:40:31.50
Yeah, but even like a karate situation like a guy who can who kick a bag like that guy

575
00:40:31.50 --> 00:40:35.66
Does know how to kick by the way and there's some forms of karate. What is it?

576
00:40:38.30 --> 00:40:40.94
Yeah, there's some forms of karate that are legit and they

577
00:40:41.74 --> 00:40:47.50
They go get after it. That's what GSP's background was originally in okay. Oh, she yeah, yeah

578
00:40:47.50 --> 00:40:53.66
Yeah, that's rough. Oh, it's rough. Yeah, no head strikes though. No head strikes. We're kind of a bummer

579
00:40:53.66 --> 00:41:00.62
Yeah, I mean, I think it's like ham and grab the ghee grab your ghee and kick the crap out of your legs

580
00:41:00.62 --> 00:41:06.62
Yeah, and punch you in the ginseng. Yeah, punch you in the ginseng. Yes, that's tough. Oh, no, if it's it's it's it's well

581
00:41:06.78 --> 00:41:12.62
Let's say this it's a little bit closer to real. Yeah, right? So it's a little bit closer real. That's why it has some effectiveness

582
00:41:12.86 --> 00:41:17.34
Yeah, the more closer you are to reel the more effective something is and that's the way it goes

583
00:41:18.70 --> 00:41:20.38
all right

584
00:41:20.38 --> 00:41:27.34
Speaking of training back to the book. It is on this exact knowledge of the terrain that is

585
00:41:27.34 --> 00:41:32.38
Regulated the dispositions of the troops and the order of battle of the army

586
00:41:32.94 --> 00:41:37.74
So it's again, he's still talking about being able to look quickly and assess how you're going to set up your

587
00:41:37.74 --> 00:41:43.90
troops on the terrain our modern formations for combat for the most part are defective

588
00:41:43.90 --> 00:41:51.90
Because they cast all in the same mold as I really like this part. He's saying look it's not always the same

589
00:41:52.54 --> 00:41:56.94
What we do what we say right now is say everything lines up here realities that doesn't work

590
00:41:57.66 --> 00:42:02.86
We can't do that if an army is really to be camped according to the rules of war

591
00:42:02.86 --> 00:42:10.46
It is essential that each arm should be placed in a locality where it can act that means you got to have flexibility and what you're doing

592
00:42:10.46 --> 00:42:15.02
That's what it means now he talks about

593
00:42:16.70 --> 00:42:18.70
Detachments

594
00:42:19.18 --> 00:42:21.18
How and why they should be made

595
00:42:22.22 --> 00:42:28.38
There is an ancient rule of war that cannot be repeated often enough hold your forces together

596
00:42:28.62 --> 00:42:35.50
Make no detachments and when you want to fight the enemy reassemble all your forces and see his every advantage

597
00:42:35.98 --> 00:42:37.98
to make sure of your success

598
00:42:37.98 --> 00:42:44.62
This rule is so certain that most of the generals who have neglected it have been punished promptly

599
00:42:45.18 --> 00:42:52.38
So he's saying don't separate your forces and we I've talked about this before because that's what I believed are there times where you separate your forces?

600
00:42:52.38 --> 00:42:55.02
Yes, there are you have to be prudent you have to be smart

601
00:42:55.74 --> 00:43:02.14
And he he up here's the dichotomy he says the same thing the subject of detachments is extremely delicate

602
00:43:02.94 --> 00:43:04.94
Nun should be made

603
00:43:04.94 --> 00:43:07.42
Except for good reasons right?

604
00:43:07.42 --> 00:43:17.34
Nun should be made except for good reasons if you're acting offensively and open enemy country and are only master of some strong point so

605
00:43:19.02 --> 00:43:23.26
Again, this is something I talk about all the time once you've got your forces separated on the battlefield

606
00:43:23.26 --> 00:43:25.26
It can get problematic very very quickly

607
00:43:25.26 --> 00:43:31.18
So keep your forces consolidated as much as you can. How does that translate into the business world?

608
00:43:31.18 --> 00:43:38.46
Well, be careful when you start breaking off a little chunks chunks of your company to go and explore new territory

609
00:43:39.18 --> 00:43:41.58
Because when you break off chunks you get a little bit weaker

610
00:43:43.26 --> 00:43:45.26
So don't do that. Oh

611
00:43:45.58 --> 00:43:51.02
When you do it I'm not saying don't do it. He's not saying don't do it when you do it understand the risks that are being taken

612
00:43:51.02 --> 00:43:55.66
That's what you have to do yeah, and it and that's good it is funny like you kind of

613
00:43:55.66 --> 00:44:01.82
How you said that where it's like no you know basically the idea that it's like this is the hard and fast rule

614
00:44:01.82 --> 00:44:08.14
But yeah, you don't kind of think yeah, that is a good way to put it because if you don't say it like that or you don't present it like that

615
00:44:09.10 --> 00:44:11.10
It kind of in a way makes you think

616
00:44:12.06 --> 00:44:19.74
Why can't bend that rule then you know and it kind of it's like two the people might be too cavalier about the whole thing about making the exception

617
00:44:19.74 --> 00:44:22.70
Yeah, yeah, you're right. So you got I got a question for you

618
00:44:22.70 --> 00:44:26.14
And how does it supply to jiu-jitsu?

619
00:44:28.30 --> 00:44:35.50
Like what a specific move. Okay, so actually I'll use your example which has stuck with me from the first time you said it by the way

620
00:44:35.50 --> 00:44:40.54
Jack that don't don't put your elbow cross your mid-divine your my eldest yeah, like where you're going

621
00:44:41.34 --> 00:44:46.78
So the game you're like okay, and actually you gave an example of this, but okay, so the you

622
00:44:47.82 --> 00:44:50.54
You should never put your arm across your chest. You should never do it

623
00:44:50.54 --> 00:44:58.14
Every once in a while and I almost say not even every once in a while. I'll just say there is an exception

624
00:44:58.14 --> 00:45:02.94
Yeah, where you know and I think you had a situation with Dean yeah, where you're like Dean

625
00:45:02.94 --> 00:45:07.58
He messed you up, but you thought about it later. So no he told me later. Oh, okay. Oh, here

626
00:45:07.98 --> 00:45:15.82
You have to do something that I've told you never to do here. You have to do it. That's from the mount. It's from you turn so far that you that there's an escape

627
00:45:15.82 --> 00:45:19.42
Hmm, where I was gonna when I was gonna talk about this

628
00:45:20.70 --> 00:45:24.86
With the way that supplies to jiu-jitsu this specifically you're talking about something else that does apply to jiu-jiu

629
00:45:24.86 --> 00:45:27.10
This applies to jiu-jitsu picture this

630
00:45:27.98 --> 00:45:29.74
Your your all one body, right?

631
00:45:29.74 --> 00:45:31.74
When you're doing jiu-jitsu

632
00:45:31.74 --> 00:45:32.78
It is

633
00:45:32.78 --> 00:45:38.54
highly advantageous to keep your arms and your legs close to your body. Especially your arms, right?

634
00:45:38.54 --> 00:45:43.74
You don't stick your arm out right? What happens when you stick your arm out? It's out there by itself and it's it's taking over

635
00:45:43.74 --> 00:45:49.58
There's our locked as you take it over there. So so you don't do that you keep your arms and close to your body and that's where you

636
00:45:51.18 --> 00:45:55.10
Fabio Fabio Santos he used to say make like your arms come out of your belly

637
00:45:55.66 --> 00:46:00.54
Like you don't even have shoulders like your elbows just come out of your belly that's how you should keep your arms

638
00:46:00.54 --> 00:46:02.54
And I I've always obeyed that rule

639
00:46:03.42 --> 00:46:07.90
Accept there are times when yes, you gotta reach out and you gotta make another move happen

640
00:46:08.14 --> 00:46:12.22
So as much as you can you keep your forces consolidated as a body as a human

641
00:46:12.22 --> 00:46:15.50
You know occasionally you gotta stop on that. Yeah

642
00:46:16.30 --> 00:46:18.30
So

643
00:46:18.54 --> 00:46:24.38
But yeah, if you when you put it like that it's it's pretty clear that it's like hey, this isn't like some ambiguous rule

644
00:46:24.38 --> 00:46:29.42
That's that's the rule. Keep keep your arms in that's the rule and then

645
00:46:29.98 --> 00:46:32.38
Remember the golden child you ever watched the golden child?

646
00:46:32.38 --> 00:46:37.34
I don't know okay anywhere. This is called the golden child this old school 80s movie, but he was like hey

647
00:46:37.34 --> 00:46:42.54
Stand the path he was like hey you gotta walk on these like stumps in the dark and get this glass of water

648
00:46:43.34 --> 00:46:48.22
Booter thing I think and he's like hey stand the path you gotta stand the path that's it

649
00:46:48.22 --> 00:46:51.90
That's the what's the only advice I can give you I think there's something else, but that was it

650
00:46:51.90 --> 00:46:55.98
So he could stay in the path right and there's this weird rope bridge and he

651
00:46:56.38 --> 00:47:00.22
Right as he gets off the rope bridge first into flames and he's like hey

652
00:47:00.46 --> 00:47:04.86
I thought you told me to stay on the path and he said yes, but you got to know when to break the rules

653
00:47:04.86 --> 00:47:08.86
There you go, that's it right epic lessons learn Eddie Merdy

654
00:47:08.86 --> 00:47:16.06
If you go didn't chill, it's too bad. All right, so no problem we can come up people from different angles

655
00:47:16.06 --> 00:47:20.14
I'm sure there's someone that's in the podcast was like oh, yeah, oh, now I get it

656
00:47:20.14 --> 00:47:22.14
It's too bad

657
00:47:22.14 --> 00:47:24.14
Whoever you are out there

658
00:47:24.14 --> 00:47:26.14
I got Charles's a god you're back

659
00:47:26.14 --> 00:47:36.62
This is a great section. This is a great section the talents that a general must have

660
00:47:38.30 --> 00:47:40.30
And then it talks about

661
00:47:41.42 --> 00:47:46.78
Spies and rooses and strategums of war, but here we go talents

662
00:47:47.98 --> 00:47:54.46
That a general must have a perfect general like Plato's Republic is a figment of the imagination

663
00:47:54.46 --> 00:48:02.06
Either would be admirable, but is not characteristic of human nature to produce beings

664
00:48:02.62 --> 00:48:05.26
Exempt from human weakness and defects

665
00:48:07.98 --> 00:48:11.18
The finest medallions have a reverse side

666
00:48:12.06 --> 00:48:13.66
Dang

667
00:48:13.66 --> 00:48:17.66
I like that so yeah, there's no such thing as a perfect leader and everyone has weaknesses and

668
00:48:18.46 --> 00:48:23.98
But then he says the finest medallions have a reverse side and I don't know if you remember

669
00:48:23.98 --> 00:48:25.98
me saying this I've said it before I'll say it again

670
00:48:26.86 --> 00:48:30.94
Oftentimes people's biggest strength is also their biggest weakness

671
00:48:31.58 --> 00:48:36.94
Right, so if you got a guy that's super aggressive and that's what makes him such a good for a certain job

672
00:48:37.50 --> 00:48:41.90
They also can be too aggressive and it ends so there's a bunch of examples like that

673
00:48:42.14 --> 00:48:50.06
But the finest medallions have a reverse side even if you think about what your personal best quality is like you got to watch out because it can be out of balance

674
00:48:50.06 --> 00:48:53.34
If you if you let it go too far

675
00:48:54.94 --> 00:48:59.26
Now he says this but in spite of this awareness of our per in perfection

676
00:48:59.26 --> 00:49:05.98
It is not less necessary to consider all the different talents that are needed by an accomplished general

677
00:49:06.78 --> 00:49:13.66
These are the models that want attempts to imitate and which one would not try to approach if they were not presented to us

678
00:49:13.66 --> 00:49:15.66
So he's like hey look even though we can't be perfect

679
00:49:15.66 --> 00:49:21.58
We should still look and see what perfect is so that we can at least try and get there nothing wrong with that

680
00:49:23.34 --> 00:49:25.34
Here we go

681
00:49:25.66 --> 00:49:31.66
It is essential that a general should disemble while appearing to be occupied

682
00:49:33.10 --> 00:49:35.10
So what he's saying is you got to detach a little bit

683
00:49:36.30 --> 00:49:41.50
Working with the mind and working with the body and here he goes into a good list right here

684
00:49:42.30 --> 00:49:44.30
Seacelessly suspicious

685
00:49:44.30 --> 00:49:47.02
While affecting tranquility

686
00:49:47.74 --> 00:49:52.06
So you act like you're calm, but you should constantly be suspicious of what is happening

687
00:49:53.34 --> 00:50:01.18
Here's a solid one saving of the blood of his soldiers and not squandering it except for the most important interests

688
00:50:05.42 --> 00:50:07.42
Take care of your people

689
00:50:07.82 --> 00:50:10.30
Informed of everything that makes sense

690
00:50:10.30 --> 00:50:17.34
Always on the lookout to deceive the enemy and careful not to be deceived himself

691
00:50:19.26 --> 00:50:21.26
Make sense

692
00:50:21.26 --> 00:50:24.06
In a word he should be more than industrious

693
00:50:24.70 --> 00:50:27.02
Active and indifatigable

694
00:50:27.02 --> 00:50:39.02
Not forgetting one thing to execute another and above all not despising those sorts of little details which pertain to great projects

695
00:50:43.34 --> 00:50:45.34
So you got to be more than just like hardworking

696
00:50:46.86 --> 00:50:48.86
You got to be more than

697
00:50:48.86 --> 00:50:50.86
Active

698
00:50:50.86 --> 00:50:55.42
And he goes into a little clarity around some of these

699
00:50:57.42 --> 00:51:03.26
Here we go back to the decimulation of the general consists of the important art of hiding his thoughts

700
00:51:04.78 --> 00:51:07.66
Now this is this is one of those things where people start to freak out a little bit

701
00:51:08.54 --> 00:51:12.46
Because because these days everyone throws around the transparency word

702
00:51:13.02 --> 00:51:14.46
Everyone should be transparent

703
00:51:14.46 --> 00:51:18.86
Sir, it's like actually no you you shouldn't be transparent all the time

704
00:51:18.86 --> 00:51:25.66
Yeah, and in fact, you know, that's why I talk about controlling your emotions all the time and that's why it's so powerful

705
00:51:25.66 --> 00:51:29.42
If if you're getting mad at someone and you show them that you're getting mad

706
00:51:29.74 --> 00:51:33.74
Well then you're giving away your hand and now they're gonna get mad at you and it's just a problem

707
00:51:34.14 --> 00:51:38.70
So you need to you need to not do that you need to not be transparent

708
00:51:39.74 --> 00:51:44.86
Yeah, and this he goes into brilliant explanations as to why you can't just be transparent

709
00:51:44.86 --> 00:51:49.18
Hiding you need to be hiding his thoughts. Okay

710
00:51:50.70 --> 00:51:57.26
He should be constantly on the stage and should appear most tranquil most tranquil when he is most occupied

711
00:51:57.66 --> 00:52:03.26
For the whole army speculates on his looks on his gestures and on his mood

712
00:52:04.22 --> 00:52:10.22
So when you're walking around and you're panicking guess what everyone on the team is looking at you going what it's going on

713
00:52:10.22 --> 00:52:12.22
Why is the boss panicking

714
00:52:12.22 --> 00:52:16.54
If he is seen to be more thoughtful than customary

715
00:52:17.42 --> 00:52:21.66
The officers will believe he is incubating some project of consequence

716
00:52:23.02 --> 00:52:28.86
If his manners uneasy they believe that affairs are going badly and they often imagine worse than the truth

717
00:52:29.42 --> 00:52:31.42
Gotta stay calm

718
00:52:31.98 --> 00:52:36.62
Gotta put on you gotta put on the little mask over your little emotions

719
00:52:36.62 --> 00:52:46.78
And he says the these suppositions become the rumors of the army and this army gossip is certain to pass over to the enemies camp

720
00:52:47.10 --> 00:52:51.82
It is necessary therefore that the personal conduct of the general should be so well-reasoned

721
00:52:52.38 --> 00:52:57.34
That his dissimulation will be so profound that no one can ever penetrate it

722
00:53:00.06 --> 00:53:04.46
If he fears that he cannot master his expression, so no one should ever know what you're thinking

723
00:53:04.46 --> 00:53:11.10
Unless you want him to know that right unless you want to give it to him because I say this all the time

724
00:53:11.10 --> 00:53:15.66
You can't just be without emotions. Yeah, you can't if you if you come to me and you're all mad

725
00:53:15.66 --> 00:53:21.10
I just can't be like calm down. No, I can't do that. I need to I need to give you some of that

726
00:53:21.42 --> 00:53:25.98
So I'm not saying never be emotional which is better control them they better be the emotions you want to show

727
00:53:27.74 --> 00:53:29.74
And then he says this is funny

728
00:53:29.74 --> 00:53:37.58
Talking about the the general if he fears that he cannot master his expression either he can pretend to be ill

729
00:53:37.58 --> 00:53:42.06
or he should make an excuse of some personal trouble to explain his appearance to the public

730
00:53:43.98 --> 00:53:45.74
You know, yeah, that's pretty funny

731
00:53:45.74 --> 00:53:51.74
Yeah, that's actually when you think about it like a lot of us kind of do that like like uh, you know

732
00:53:51.74 --> 00:53:58.54
I'm just tired or something like that, you know like if you like if girls crying or something or something like this

733
00:53:58.54 --> 00:54:02.62
Oh, no, I just had something in my eye. It's kind of the same thing. You know they're like oh

734
00:54:02.62 --> 00:54:06.54
It's disgusting here. Yeah, there's something else wrong with me that's understandable. You don't

735
00:54:06.54 --> 00:54:11.34
So not me crying or nothing. Yeah, yeah, I was gonna bring up an excuse

736
00:54:13.10 --> 00:54:16.38
But that's different you know and you're confused for your reason

737
00:54:16.38 --> 00:54:19.26
You're doing your jet to someone and they're like yeah, you know, I just got moved to

738
00:54:21.02 --> 00:54:24.06
That's like yeah, that's all you hear. Yeah, but

739
00:54:24.06 --> 00:54:27.66
Yeah, excuse you don't tell me that

740
00:54:30.70 --> 00:54:32.70
But that's

741
00:54:32.70 --> 00:54:35.10
Interesting advice that shows you how important it is

742
00:54:35.50 --> 00:54:39.42
You know if you're if you're willing to do like skip work because you don't want people to see your freaking out

743
00:54:39.42 --> 00:54:45.50
I don't recommend that but hey, I can't come in to the music. Yeah, I think the opposite actually happens

744
00:54:45.50 --> 00:54:49.58
Honour yeah, well that's what they'll say if they're hungover, you know what uh

745
00:54:49.58 --> 00:54:55.98
People in the teams that would say people do the opposite and they have like problems at home

746
00:54:56.70 --> 00:55:00.14
Like calling and say like yeah, I can't make it say what they're really doing it's like crying

747
00:55:01.26 --> 00:55:03.26
Because they're gonna be scrapped with their old lady

748
00:55:04.70 --> 00:55:06.70
All right

749
00:55:06.70 --> 00:55:09.50
In this is this is brilliant right here above all

750
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:18.62
When he has received some bad news he should treat it as a trifle and show the number of resources which he has to retrieve it

751
00:55:20.46 --> 00:55:26.06
It's basically good that's that's saying good when somebody go when you have when you receive some bad news

752
00:55:26.06 --> 00:55:29.82
Ah good bring it that's he saying the exact same thing

753
00:55:29.82 --> 00:55:37.82
Hmm

754
00:55:37.82 --> 00:55:44.30
Speak of him accept with scorn and compare carefully the advantages of our troops over the others

755
00:55:46.62 --> 00:55:48.62
So he's actually saying look

756
00:55:49.66 --> 00:55:56.22
He's doing the opposite he's like I don't even hate my enemy, but I'll never let anyone know that I don't completely despise him

757
00:55:56.22 --> 00:55:58.22
Right that's pretty funny

758
00:56:00.14 --> 00:56:05.26
This is good if some detachment is unfortunate in the war he should examine the cause and

759
00:56:06.14 --> 00:56:10.30
After having determined the reason for the fault he should instruct his officers concerning it

760
00:56:10.86 --> 00:56:18.06
In this fashion a few minor misfortunes will never discourage the troops and they will always preserve the feeling of confidence in their ability

761
00:56:18.22 --> 00:56:20.22
So when something goes wrong you don't freak out

762
00:56:20.70 --> 00:56:24.86
You just look okay, well, let's take a look at what we're wrong there and then we'll fix it and then it won't be a problem anymore

763
00:56:24.86 --> 00:56:28.14
That's how you handle a problem when someone doesn't do well

764
00:56:30.54 --> 00:56:39.02
Back to the book secrecy is so necessary for a general that the ancients have even said that there was not a human being able to hold his tongue

765
00:56:39.98 --> 00:56:45.90
But here's the reason for that if you form the finest plans in the world but devolves them your enemy will learn about them and then

766
00:56:46.22 --> 00:56:48.70
It will be very easy for him to carry them

767
00:56:48.70 --> 00:56:56.06
The general plan of the campaign should be communicated at most to the officer responsible for supplies

768
00:56:56.06 --> 00:57:03.10
And the rest of the details should not be told to officers except when the time has come to execute them when there are generals

769
00:57:03.98 --> 00:57:08.22
Detached and you must write to them the letter should be completely encode

770
00:57:09.02 --> 00:57:12.70
If you're enemy intercepts one you will not have betrayed yourself

771
00:57:13.26 --> 00:57:15.50
This is clearly something that applies

772
00:57:15.50 --> 00:57:20.14
To that type of warfare back in the day, but it applies to

773
00:57:20.94 --> 00:57:23.18
Life as well. I mean when you open your mouth

774
00:57:23.82 --> 00:57:29.90
Yeah, yeah, you might as well just you might as well just put it on Twitter because everyone's gonna know about it

775
00:57:29.90 --> 00:57:34.34
Yeah, yeah, the kind where and they always say it before they say something of

776
00:57:35.10 --> 00:57:40.78
Consequence they'll say hey don't tell anyone this, but hey, I'm gonna do this or I feel this or whatever

777
00:57:40.78 --> 00:57:43.82
And then sure enough they go and it's the same thing. Hey

778
00:57:43.82 --> 00:57:45.82
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you know

779
00:57:45.82 --> 00:57:50.46
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure enough this back is bad bad completely just got told

780
00:57:50.46 --> 00:57:53.18
I'm not supposed to tell you this. Yeah, that's why yeah, yeah

781
00:57:53.58 --> 00:57:57.66
Because you don't say everything. Yeah, there's an old hardcore band burp gonna kill

782
00:57:57.66 --> 00:58:03.02
I think let's say I think it was wrecking crew from Boston and they used to have

783
00:58:03.58 --> 00:58:06.46
T-shirts just big letters on the t-shirts on the back

784
00:58:07.34 --> 00:58:09.34
Trust no one

785
00:58:10.30 --> 00:58:12.30
I add one yeah

786
00:58:12.30 --> 00:58:16.22
Yeah, that actually sounds familiar like I might have seen a shirt like that before

787
00:58:16.22 --> 00:58:20.38
I don't know if you saw that shirt maybe other people made it because they probably there's probably like 12 of those

788
00:58:20.38 --> 00:58:22.38
Turns back

789
00:58:22.38 --> 00:58:26.06
It's not something echoed you're also gonna see none the I work a Y yeah, yeah, yeah

790
00:58:27.34 --> 00:58:29.34
No, probably not

791
00:58:29.34 --> 00:58:34.94
Loose lips think ships, right? That's the deal. There you go. See, so we do say that you are correct

792
00:58:34.94 --> 00:58:41.90
Yeah, back to the book. It is absolutely necessary to change your methods often and to imagine new decoys

793
00:58:42.46 --> 00:58:52.22
If you always act in the same manner you will soon be interpreted for you are surrounded with 50,000 curious who wants to know everything that you think and how you're going to lead them

794
00:58:53.26 --> 00:58:58.62
That's pretty cool. It's it's interesting what what's kind of interesting about that is he's not even talking about the enemy

795
00:58:58.62 --> 00:59:05.74
He's talking about your own people. If you know you got to think a new things and this is clearly

796
00:59:05.74 --> 00:59:10.78
This is something I always try to explain people in your jitsu is the thing that you're going for is not going to work

797
00:59:10.78 --> 00:59:17.02
You you have to use the you have to use create new decoys you have to try new things or else you're not gonna catch people

798
00:59:17.26 --> 00:59:19.26
It's a way it works

799
00:59:19.90 --> 00:59:24.94
Now here we get Nick I'm glad that I'm the life and I just got done writing a book called the decodemulator ship because

800
00:59:24.94 --> 00:59:29.74
Here we go the commander should practice kindness and

801
00:59:30.94 --> 00:59:32.94
severity

802
00:59:33.10 --> 00:59:35.82
Should appear friendly to shoulders

803
00:59:36.14 --> 00:59:42.46
Speak to them on the march visit them while they are cooking ask them if they're well care for it and alleviate their needs if they have any

804
00:59:43.18 --> 00:59:45.66
Officers without experience and wars should be treated kindly

805
00:59:45.98 --> 00:59:50.54
They're good action should be praised small request should be granted them and they should

806
00:59:50.54 --> 00:59:54.54
Not be treated in a manner and an overbearing manner manner

807
00:59:55.74 --> 01:00:00.14
So there you go. It's like that's all good right? That's the kindness part

808
01:00:00.94 --> 01:00:07.34
Which we're down with that and that's again that's why when I talked about why people would listen to this guy

809
01:00:07.34 --> 01:00:09.34
One of the reasons because he took care of his people

810
01:00:10.22 --> 01:00:13.66
He was out there seeing what problems they had how can we get those problem fixed?

811
01:00:13.66 --> 01:00:21.02
And then he says but severity is maintained about everything regarding the service

812
01:00:21.66 --> 01:00:26.62
The negligent officer is punished the man who answers back is made to feel your severity by being

813
01:00:26.62 --> 01:00:30.06
Reprimanded with a foritative error that superiority gives

814
01:00:30.62 --> 01:00:35.50
pillaging or argumentative soldiers or those who who's obedience is not immediate

815
01:00:35.50 --> 01:00:37.50
immediate should be punished

816
01:00:39.02 --> 01:00:41.02
So there you go dichotomy

817
01:00:41.02 --> 01:00:45.90
You got to hold the line but at the same time don't hold that line so tight that it snaps

818
01:00:47.42 --> 01:00:49.42
Which you can do

819
01:00:50.70 --> 01:00:56.54
The general can even discuss the war with some of his core commanders who are the most intelligent and

820
01:00:56.54 --> 01:00:59.34
Permit them to express their sentiments freely in conversations

821
01:00:59.34 --> 01:01:02.30
So when I was talking about how he was just everyone listening to me

822
01:01:03.34 --> 01:01:06.38
Blind obedience is what a required here. He's saying no actually listen to your people

823
01:01:06.38 --> 01:01:14.54
Hmm if you find some good things among what they say you should not remark about it then but make use of it

824
01:01:15.50 --> 01:01:18.94
When this has been done you should speak about it in the presence of many others

825
01:01:19.02 --> 01:01:21.98
It was so and so who had this idea praise him for it

826
01:01:22.94 --> 01:01:30.14
This modesty will gain the general the friendship of good thinking men and he will more easily

827
01:01:30.14 --> 01:01:37.14
Find persons who will speak their sentiments sincerely to him boom so that thing that

828
01:01:37.14 --> 01:01:42.14
Module thing in the beginning was not true. This is what's true. Yeah, you want to you want to have

829
01:01:42.46 --> 01:01:48.22
He's the reason that he's doing this is because he wants people to speak their mind to him that the reason why he's doing this

830
01:01:50.62 --> 01:01:52.62
Think about that

831
01:01:53.50 --> 01:01:58.78
It's also it's also interesting that because I say this you're here me talk about how like it's

832
01:01:58.78 --> 01:02:02.70
Whenever someone's right and I'm wrong. I'm happy because if you're right and I'm wrong

833
01:02:02.70 --> 01:02:08.70
I can be like oh man. That's really good job man. That's yeah really pointing that out and it and it it shows you

834
01:02:09.10 --> 01:02:13.10
That I'm humble yeah, because otherwise you're just like oh do you talk with things right?

835
01:02:13.10 --> 01:02:17.02
Oh no, yeah heck oh man you're right. I'm wrong. That's good job. Hey appreciate you

836
01:02:17.02 --> 01:02:20.86
Straighten me out on that right? Yes, you are right actually yeah

837
01:02:22.06 --> 01:02:27.26
And so that's what he's saying is it actually gives you the opportunity to be modest and to be humble

838
01:02:27.26 --> 01:02:32.86
Yeah, because I'm not as it can be hard when you're right all the time yeah and you still that feeling and

839
01:02:33.74 --> 01:02:38.86
Yeah, yeah, and well there's a guy thinks kind of funny because I can imagine or I can kind of remember

840
01:02:39.74 --> 01:02:44.70
a few times where you're like yeah, yeah, you are correct. You are correct and you'll say that you are correct

841
01:02:44.70 --> 01:02:48.86
Yeah, I'm kind of happy when you're right. Yeah, like in and that's what I feel like

842
01:02:48.86 --> 01:02:55.66
I'm just not small but it's there and it's something now it's like all right

843
01:02:55.66 --> 01:03:00.54
Well, that's one of the one of the tactics I guess yeah, but it's no work. So I guess my over his

844
01:03:01.26 --> 01:03:03.26
Am I over here just manipulating you

845
01:03:05.74 --> 01:03:08.30
Put it this way. I'm glad to be here. You know so

846
01:03:08.30 --> 01:03:14.14
Well, that's a question for you and we've talked about this before if if the reason I was doing it was so that like I could get something

847
01:03:14.14 --> 01:03:17.58
How do you that would benefit me and not that if it and hurt you then yeah

848
01:03:17.58 --> 01:03:22.30
Be manipulation but if it's like hey, we're just trying to build which I'd make something happen. Yeah

849
01:03:23.02 --> 01:03:28.38
Then yeah, then it's all good in my opinion kind of gives me room to talk to which is empowering

850
01:03:28.38 --> 01:03:31.50
You know, sure hey, I abuse it from the time that time I understand

851
01:03:31.90 --> 01:03:37.18
But there was do would you say the last podcast was an example of that a B.A. was ordering on abuse

852
01:03:37.18 --> 01:03:43.02
I can't brush my mind over the line over the line over the line

853
01:03:43.02 --> 01:03:46.78
No, it was in the body body volume. I think what it was

854
01:03:47.74 --> 01:03:52.30
I drank some of that discipline and I was on that white tea and listen to this

855
01:03:52.54 --> 01:03:54.54
I'm just saying you know what you need to do right now

856
01:03:55.34 --> 01:04:00.06
Own it. Yeah, like the white tea you'll play the business and that I got your brain fire incorrectly

857
01:04:00.78 --> 01:04:03.90
I think you are correct people gonna cut you off thing like don't get many more

858
01:04:03.90 --> 01:04:11.10
Yeah, right told you I've been pounding that stuff the camera. Yeah, well, it's tasty. No did assimilated

859
01:04:11.66 --> 01:04:13.02
assimilated

860
01:04:13.02 --> 01:04:16.38
Back to the book the principal task of the general is mental

861
01:04:17.82 --> 01:04:19.82
Large projects and major arrangements

862
01:04:20.62 --> 01:04:24.94
But since the best dispositions become useless if they are not executed

863
01:04:25.26 --> 01:04:31.66
It is essential that the general should be industrious to see whether his orders are executed or not again

864
01:04:31.66 --> 01:04:35.74
Just because you say go make this happen doesn't mean it's gonna happen

865
01:04:36.30 --> 01:04:38.30
You gotta get out there and make sure it happens

866
01:04:41.34 --> 01:04:46.70
Moving on here's a here's a line you can just you can just you can just print this up

867
01:04:48.94 --> 01:04:51.58
Skepticism is the mother of security

868
01:04:52.78 --> 01:04:54.78
That's legit

869
01:04:55.02 --> 01:04:59.34
Even though only fools trust their enemies prudent persons never do

870
01:04:59.34 --> 01:05:06.94
The general is the principal centenal of his army think about that the general is the principal centenal of the army

871
01:05:07.02 --> 01:05:13.42
The guy that's the guy that's keeping everyone safe is the general he's the primary watchstander for everyone

872
01:05:14.70 --> 01:05:19.50
He should always be careful of its preservation and that is never exposed to misfortune

873
01:05:20.70 --> 01:05:27.82
One falls into a feeling of security after battles when one is drunk with success and when one believes the enemy

874
01:05:27.82 --> 01:05:29.82
Completely disheartened

875
01:05:30.54 --> 01:05:37.90
So we all know that you know when that happens you know what Jeff Higgs told me if you tap a guy out like if you have someone that like legit

876
01:05:37.90 --> 01:05:41.74
You have you have battles with on the map and you tap them out

877
01:05:42.30 --> 01:05:44.30
You need to step it up

878
01:05:44.30 --> 01:05:48.70
What right after you're gonna step it up bringing a year all relaxed you're all celebrating your victory

879
01:05:48.70 --> 01:05:58.54
Don't do it step it up. They're coming hard. Yeah, you do that to me all the time. Yes, sir. Okay, I

880
01:05:59.74 --> 01:06:01.74
Hey back to that

881
01:06:01.98 --> 01:06:06.06
The one you're saying before this about you know how like you let them talk or whatever

882
01:06:07.26 --> 01:06:15.74
The opposite of that is if you know let's say when you subordinate to whoever like said something to you and then you respond with the opposite of what you do

883
01:06:15.74 --> 01:06:20.52
With this either tone or words that basically say oh, I already knew that you know

884
01:06:20.52 --> 01:06:23.90
You know, I already knew that like you don't have to tell me kind of thing. I already knew that

885
01:06:24.38 --> 01:06:31.58
People will do that even just on a real small even on a social level sometimes and it does make you not want to talk to them that much

886
01:06:31.58 --> 01:06:38.46
Yeah, for sure it the the idea of saying I already knew that yeah is not good. Yeah

887
01:06:38.46 --> 01:06:44.78
That's an extreme of this case. But what's funny about it? Yeah, yeah a tone can save but also I already knew that you

888
01:06:45.58 --> 01:06:48.54
Didn't know it if you would have known it you would have said it

889
01:06:48.54 --> 01:06:55.98
Yeah, most likely like that's an 80% sure 20% of the time you might be like hey, Jockel arm walks work from the garden too

890
01:06:55.98 --> 01:06:57.26
I'd be like

891
01:06:57.26 --> 01:07:02.22
I even then I wouldn't say already knew that. I'd be like me. You know what yeah, that's that's something definitely good to consider

892
01:07:02.86 --> 01:07:07.10
You know that's sort of a general principle that I totally agree with you know something like that

893
01:07:07.10 --> 01:07:13.18
Just not I already knew that yeah, or will of course yeah, or you know that's extreme, but well of course

894
01:07:13.18 --> 01:07:17.74
That's the one whether you know what forces those words out of your mouth. What you're ego

895
01:07:18.14 --> 01:07:21.98
It's your ego because you don't want that person to have that piece of information that you didn't have so you just

896
01:07:22.54 --> 01:07:23.90
I already knew yeah

897
01:07:23.90 --> 01:07:25.42
I think this is hard

898
01:07:25.42 --> 01:07:31.58
Yeah, I mean I can't say that it's not natural. I mean it feels you know if especially if you did already know it

899
01:07:31.58 --> 01:07:36.86
It's like oh, I don't want him to think that I didn't know that when I really did kind of thing like I don't want him to think

900
01:07:36.86 --> 01:07:39.74
I'm like not what you need to do is you need to trust

901
01:07:41.66 --> 01:07:45.58
You need to trust the nature of the world and the nature of the world is that

902
01:07:46.46 --> 01:07:51.34
You will eventually be seeing as someone that actually does know that yeah clearly, you know that yeah

903
01:07:51.98 --> 01:07:54.46
Trust the nature of the world trust the nature of the world

904
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:57.66
All right here's another situation

905
01:07:58.22 --> 01:08:01.98
One falls into a feeling of security when a skillful enemy

906
01:08:01.98 --> 01:08:10.94
It abuses you with pretend peace proposals one falls into a feeling of security by mental laziness and through lack of

907
01:08:11.18 --> 01:08:13.58
Calculation concerning the intentions of the enemy

908
01:08:16.14 --> 01:08:18.14
Mental laziness

909
01:08:18.14 --> 01:08:20.14
Just say no to the mental laziness

910
01:08:20.86 --> 01:08:26.78
To proceed and then now he gives instructions how to overcome these situations to proceed properly

911
01:08:26.78 --> 01:08:32.30
It is necessary to put oneself in his place and say what would I do if I were the enemy?

912
01:08:32.94 --> 01:08:38.46
What project could I form make as many as possible of these projects

913
01:08:38.94 --> 01:08:43.66
Examine them all and above all reflect on the means to avert them

914
01:08:44.62 --> 01:08:46.62
If you find yourself unable

915
01:08:48.06 --> 01:08:50.06
Put it right at once

916
01:08:50.06 --> 01:08:53.82
So look it even when you win go, okay, well if I were the enemy what would I do right now?

917
01:08:53.82 --> 01:08:57.90
And if you can't figure out how to solve what you think the enemy's gonna do then correct it right now

918
01:09:01.98 --> 01:09:02.94
Often

919
01:09:02.94 --> 01:09:05.18
Through an hours neglect and

920
01:09:05.58 --> 01:09:06.62
Unfortunate delay

921
01:09:06.86 --> 01:09:10.94
Loses a reputation that has been acquired with a great deal of labor

922
01:09:11.66 --> 01:09:17.98
Always presume that the enemy has dangerous designs and always be forehanded with the remedy

923
01:09:17.98 --> 01:09:26.86
So you got to be careful if what the enemy is gonna do you've always got to imagine that the enemy is ready for you

924
01:09:26.86 --> 01:09:31.58
You got to be ready for that that's got to be your mindset and that's an extreme mindset like the enemies always

925
01:09:32.14 --> 01:09:38.54
Waiting and ready yeah, and you can go too far with that mindset. There's a dichotomy in here is the dichotomy of it back to the book

926
01:09:39.26 --> 01:09:43.74
But do not let these calculations make you timid

927
01:09:43.74 --> 01:09:45.74
Hmm

928
01:09:45.74 --> 01:09:49.10
So just because you're thinking about the enemy might do this the enemy might do this and you could overwhelm you

929
01:09:49.10 --> 01:09:54.46
You know what screw it I'm not gonna do anything. Yeah, no don't let these calculations make you timid

930
01:09:54.86 --> 01:09:58.38
Circumspection is only good to a certain point

931
01:09:59.58 --> 01:10:05.34
Or rule that I practice myself and which I have always found good is that in order to have

932
01:10:05.58 --> 01:10:07.58
Rest oneself

933
01:10:07.58 --> 01:10:13.66
It is necessary to keep the enemy occupied if you want to rest yourself you gotta keep the enemy occupied

934
01:10:15.18 --> 01:10:18.46
Gotta put your competitor you gotta put your competitor on their heels

935
01:10:18.94 --> 01:10:25.18
If you want to get any rest of it, you gotta put your competitor on their heels then he says this throws them back on the defensive and once they are placed

936
01:10:25.18 --> 01:10:33.02
That way they cannot raise up again during the entire campaign you just go you when you get that lead on someone you put them down

937
01:10:34.06 --> 01:10:36.06
That's one of the thing I noticed in in

938
01:10:36.06 --> 01:10:40.62
MMA like someone was like oh you won that last round you got this no

939
01:10:41.10 --> 01:10:45.26
No, I actually don't say that to your corner. Yeah, you like hey

940
01:10:45.82 --> 01:10:48.06
He got guys gonna step it up

941
01:10:48.22 --> 01:10:52.62
He's gonna come out harder. This is the round that he's wanting he's coming after you you need to step it up

942
01:10:52.62 --> 01:10:53.82
You didn't win that round

943
01:10:53.82 --> 01:10:56.86
It's not gonna happen. I mean, you never know who won the round because judges are so horrible

944
01:11:00.86 --> 01:11:02.46
Okay

945
01:11:02.46 --> 01:11:06.14
Continuing on back to the book if you wish to be loved by your soldiers

946
01:11:06.62 --> 01:11:09.34
Husband their blood and do not lead them to slaughter

947
01:11:10.78 --> 01:11:16.70
So that's it that's an obvious statement right but he talks about that in detail. That's important

948
01:11:17.66 --> 01:11:24.38
They can be spared by shortening the battle by means that I shall indicate by the skill with which you choose

949
01:11:24.38 --> 01:11:27.18
Your points of attack in the weakest localities

950
01:11:27.18 --> 01:11:33.74
In not breaking your head against impracticable things which are ridiculous to attempt

951
01:11:34.86 --> 01:11:40.30
In not fatiguing the soldiers uselessly and inspiring him in seedes and battles

952
01:11:41.74 --> 01:11:44.38
So he's saying you got to take care your your men

953
01:11:45.42 --> 01:11:47.90
You got husband there blood and not lead them to slaughter

954
01:11:48.54 --> 01:11:50.54
But the way you do that

955
01:11:51.18 --> 01:11:53.50
Is by attacking the weak locations is

956
01:11:53.50 --> 01:11:57.98
I you know how many times you heard me say like don't blame bang your head against the ball 47 times like

957
01:11:58.46 --> 01:12:02.70
47 okay, that's the limit. Yeah, okay 48. You got to find a different way that's what he's saying

958
01:12:03.26 --> 01:12:08.14
Just keep banging your brang your head against impracticable things don't do that

959
01:12:11.26 --> 01:12:17.82
And here he says this when you seem to be most prodigal of soldiers blood you spirit

960
01:12:17.82 --> 01:12:26.38
However by supporting your attacks well by pushing them with the greatest vigor to deprive time of the means of

961
01:12:26.62 --> 01:12:29.98
Augmenting your losses. So what does he say in there? He's saying that the times

962
01:12:30.30 --> 01:12:35.18
Sometimes it might seem like you're being most wasteful of the blood of your soldiers

963
01:12:35.74 --> 01:12:37.74
But it's in those times

964
01:12:38.06 --> 01:12:42.46
It seems that way the way the reason it seems that way is because you're being super aggressive

965
01:12:42.46 --> 01:12:48.78
It's because you're you're setting up your tax your supporting them well and you're being default aggressive

966
01:12:49.74 --> 01:12:57.58
Has been their blood that's like take care of it. Yeah, I like it. Yeah, take care of it and then

967
01:12:58.30 --> 01:13:04.78
He's saying when you seem to be most prodigal of your soldiers blood that means when you're wasteful of your soldiers blood

968
01:13:06.30 --> 01:13:11.50
You spare it by supporting your attacks well that makes sense by pushing them with the greatest vigor

969
01:13:11.50 --> 01:13:17.50
That makes sense because if you guys are going out at half-ass guess what's not gonna work out well form

970
01:13:22.46 --> 01:13:25.98
Your rules of war are of great usefulness

971
01:13:27.02 --> 01:13:30.30
Are sorry, ruses of war are of great usefulness

972
01:13:31.18 --> 01:13:33.34
Ruses of war so this is like tricks right?

973
01:13:33.98 --> 01:13:40.06
They are detours listen to this they are detours which often lead more surely to the objective

974
01:13:40.06 --> 01:13:43.10
Then the wide road which goes straight ahead

975
01:13:45.02 --> 01:13:47.02
So what is he saying there?

976
01:13:47.82 --> 01:13:50.78
Don't do the frontal assault on the enemy strong point

977
01:13:52.46 --> 01:13:54.46
Use tricks

978
01:13:54.46 --> 01:13:58.30
Flames flanks and here he just breaks it down

979
01:13:59.18 --> 01:14:02.14
Animals have only one method of acting

980
01:14:02.78 --> 01:14:08.54
But intelligent men have in exhaustible resources these resources are infinite in number

981
01:14:08.54 --> 01:14:15.58
Their object is to hide your veritable design and to catch the enemy in the trap you have prepared for him

982
01:14:17.26 --> 01:14:21.82
Thus the contrary of what one wishes to do is fain

983
01:14:22.70 --> 01:14:30.14
If you open the campaign you have your troops march and counter march so that the enemy cannot learn the locality where you assemble

984
01:14:31.26 --> 01:14:38.14
If it is a question of capturing cities you and camp in a place which makes him fearful for two or three cities of

985
01:14:38.14 --> 01:14:40.70
His at the same time being attacked

986
01:14:41.90 --> 01:14:45.66
If he hastens to one flank throw yourself on the other

987
01:14:47.26 --> 01:14:49.74
This is obvious stuff

988
01:14:50.30 --> 01:14:52.30
Seems obvious

989
01:14:52.46 --> 01:14:56.14
But what are you doing when you're when you're setting up a triangle

990
01:14:56.86 --> 01:15:02.62
Right, you're you got the arm bar you you put the person in the threat of the arm bar and the triangle and the sweet ball the same time

991
01:15:03.02 --> 01:15:05.66
You you set up camp in between three cities

992
01:15:05.66 --> 01:15:08.54
They don't know which one you're gonna attack and they got to defend all of them

993
01:15:09.10 --> 01:15:13.90
Are they gonna try to defend all so when they hasten to defend the arm bar?

994
01:15:14.30 --> 01:15:16.30
Yeah, that's when you throw yourself

995
01:15:16.94 --> 01:15:19.34
Let's try and go in that triangle and go in that triangle

996
01:15:21.74 --> 01:15:25.90
You out with the enemy to force him to fight or to prevent him from it

997
01:15:25.90 --> 01:15:30.30
So he's saying that the two ways to outsmart the enemy as you either make the enemy fight

998
01:15:30.30 --> 01:15:35.98
When you don't want it when he doesn't want to or you prevent him from fighting when you don't want to fight

999
01:15:36.54 --> 01:15:38.46
And here you talk to it. This is basically a

1000
01:15:39.10 --> 01:15:42.22
Reverse psychology is what he's not to go into right now

1001
01:15:42.62 --> 01:15:46.30
There are two means of forcing the enemy to fight one is pretending to fear it

1002
01:15:47.34 --> 01:15:51.98
His self confidence becomes your accomplice security laws him into

1003
01:15:53.02 --> 01:15:58.22
Security laws him and your cunning triumphs so if you act like you're afraid

1004
01:15:58.22 --> 01:16:00.22
Maybe the person's gonna fight you

1005
01:16:01.10 --> 01:16:03.50
When it's desired to avoid battle

1006
01:16:04.22 --> 01:16:07.74
Different rooses are used and a parent war is made

1007
01:16:08.22 --> 01:16:14.14
Which has all the actions of the offensive and which nevertheless is of an opposite nature?

1008
01:16:14.14 --> 01:16:19.02
So he's saying there if you don't want to fight you act like you want to fight

1009
01:16:19.02 --> 01:16:21.42
That's that's all he's saying in a bunch of words

1010
01:16:21.42 --> 01:16:29.34
It is your attitude that imposes on your enemy and the suspicion that you give him that you are forming the bull

1011
01:16:29.90 --> 01:16:31.90
Projects against him

1012
01:16:32.54 --> 01:16:41.02
The attitude is maintained by not withdrawing easily before the enemy and often the appearance that you are waiting for him will make him lose all desire to attack you

1013
01:16:41.74 --> 01:16:46.62
But if he does come you steal away by a nightmare which you an already planned long before

1014
01:16:46.62 --> 01:16:53.02
He thinks he has you and the next day there's no one if you only withdraw

1015
01:16:53.10 --> 01:17:01.42
You will be followed but but then it is necessary to take position to the flank which will prevent him from passing you without running into great danger

1016
01:17:03.18 --> 01:17:09.50
This sort of war is a masterpiece of the Austrians and it is from them that it should be learned

1017
01:17:11.82 --> 01:17:15.90
So act aggressively and plan your escape

1018
01:17:15.90 --> 01:17:21.26
That's kind of the key thing because if you just act aggressively you might get called on it right up and he's saying act aggressively

1019
01:17:21.26 --> 01:17:23.26
But plan your escape while you're acting aggressively

1020
01:17:23.90 --> 01:17:27.98
This is gonna sound like this isn't an example because we all are too familiar with it

1021
01:17:27.98 --> 01:17:31.98
But here's the thing when it first came when this tactic first came out this is a good example

1022
01:17:31.98 --> 01:17:35.18
That very thing so at the bar that I want to fight you right

1023
01:17:35.18 --> 01:17:37.02
That's why you want to fight me you want to fight me?

1024
01:17:37.02 --> 01:17:39.98
Okay tell your friend. Hold me back. Hold me back. Hold me back. Okay. You want to fight me?

1025
01:17:39.98 --> 01:17:42.38
Yeah, let's fight this fight. Hold me back. Hold me back

1026
01:17:42.38 --> 01:17:47.18
Friends holding him back you want to fight the guys that go shoot this guy want to fight whatever and be like hey meet me outside

1027
01:17:47.82 --> 01:17:53.02
We're gonna fight outside meet me outside one minute. I want to fight it in here. You know, but I'm ready kind of thing

1028
01:17:53.82 --> 01:17:57.34
Because I thought he goes outside meet the guys. I guys gone you don't got to fight

1029
01:17:58.70 --> 01:18:01.66
Acted all aggressive. Yeah, and then when he went outside to fight you

1030
01:18:02.38 --> 01:18:07.02
If even wants to go outside to fight you might be like man this guy's gonna crazy use down a fight to all quick

1031
01:18:07.74 --> 01:18:10.38
So I might not go out there, but when he does finally go out there he's gone

1032
01:18:10.38 --> 01:18:15.02
Is it a is it a unwritten like rule that if you go to get the fight

1033
01:18:15.02 --> 01:18:18.94
I'm gonna try and hold you back because you can't like whisper this over like hold me back

1034
01:18:18.94 --> 01:18:25.10
I know but back in back in the day before everyone knew that tactic. It's kind of like that was a good tactic. Yeah, no. I'm just saying

1035
01:18:26.70 --> 01:18:32.38
Is it the general rule to just hold people back like hold your friend back from getting in a fight it depends depends

1036
01:18:32.38 --> 01:18:35.74
And I guess because if you're a bit when someone's like I'm not gonna hold you back go

1037
01:18:35.74 --> 01:18:40.70
But you want to oh yeah 100% one of my buddies who's a bad ass team guy

1038
01:18:41.66 --> 01:18:44.62
Somebody was talking smack another seal was talking smack

1039
01:18:45.26 --> 01:18:47.26
He's like I'll go kick that guy's ass

1040
01:18:48.38 --> 01:18:52.06
Thinking that my buddy would be like no, you know don't hold your back

1041
01:18:52.78 --> 01:18:57.98
He was like go ahead. Yeah, that's what you wait and for he's right over there. Yeah, I want you go get him you're running your mouth

1042
01:18:59.74 --> 01:19:01.74
Yeah, oh

1043
01:19:01.74 --> 01:19:11.02
This yeah, so go run your mouth is the key point there. Yeah, see so I feel I feel like that's kind of like a response to that old school tactic

1044
01:19:11.26 --> 01:19:15.74
Yeah, no, that's a good response to the old school tactic if you come out with me and you want to go after someone

1045
01:19:15.74 --> 01:19:20.94
I'm gonna let you go. Yeah, I mean like oh go go get to go get some suit you got because I don't like people

1046
01:19:20.94 --> 01:19:26.46
They run their mouth. You know what I mean? I don't think anyone does. Yeah, yeah, we had a guy on football

1047
01:19:26.46 --> 01:19:31.74
It's weird that everyone knows no one likes people that run their mouths, but there's a bunch of people in the world that run their mouths. Yeah

1048
01:19:32.38 --> 01:19:35.98
Explain that one. We all know it. It's kind of like the name dropping thing

1049
01:19:36.46 --> 01:19:41.58
Right, it's harder to see it in yourself than it is to see another people. It's like easy to see another people

1050
01:19:41.58 --> 01:19:45.90
I hate when they got runs his mouth mean well like that's all you do kind of thing. It's hard to see it in yourself

1051
01:19:45.90 --> 01:19:49.42
Easy to see another. I think that's one of those things. That's what I think yeah

1052
01:19:50.54 --> 01:19:52.54
But who knows yeah

1053
01:19:52.70 --> 01:19:53.90
Good point

1054
01:19:53.90 --> 01:20:00.38
That is that you just you once again for that guy that's listen you just nailed it. He's like oh

1055
01:20:01.58 --> 01:20:03.58
Got it

1056
01:20:05.66 --> 01:20:07.66
That I'll say what this book was

1057
01:20:08.22 --> 01:20:13.18
I don't know if it's the translation or whatever, but there's definitely some long complicated sentences that were

1058
01:20:14.38 --> 01:20:17.74
a little bit tricky for for me sure had a read of a few times

1059
01:20:19.34 --> 01:20:20.22
Back the book there

1060
01:20:20.22 --> 01:20:25.66
Let me by saying that what I mean is like sometimes you know a movie from 1987 is a better example

1061
01:20:26.86 --> 01:20:29.34
That's what that's what you hear for stupid real love here

1062
01:20:31.50 --> 01:20:32.54
There is another ruse

1063
01:20:33.82 --> 01:20:40.54
Which is that if you find the enemy too strong to attack him you help him with the means of dividing his forces

1064
01:20:41.02 --> 01:20:44.30
So basically if you can get people to split up if you can get your enemy to split up

1065
01:20:44.86 --> 01:20:46.86
That's a good tactic as well

1066
01:20:46.86 --> 01:20:51.58
There's another type of ruse which is admirable. It is that of double spies

1067
01:20:51.66 --> 01:20:58.54
It is necessary to know them and then tell them with an air of good faith everything that you want the enemy to know

1068
01:20:59.98 --> 01:21:01.98
So there you go

1069
01:21:02.70 --> 01:21:06.54
It is essential to know what is happening among amongst the enemy

1070
01:21:06.54 --> 01:21:14.06
I am of the opinion that the best thing against the Austrians will be to bribe some captain or major for their who SARS

1071
01:21:14.06 --> 01:21:20.46
By means of whom intelligence can be carried on with them and there's a reason why I'm talking about the series talking about spies

1072
01:21:20.46 --> 01:21:22.46
And this is kind of old school but I

1073
01:21:23.50 --> 01:21:25.82
I brought that part up so I could do this part right here

1074
01:21:27.10 --> 01:21:31.02
If greed for silver does not work it is necessary to employ fear

1075
01:21:33.50 --> 01:21:41.34
Seize some mayor of a village where you camp and force him to take a disguised man who speaks the language of the country and

1076
01:21:41.34 --> 01:21:46.22
Under some pretext to conduct him as his servant in the enemy army

1077
01:21:47.90 --> 01:21:54.46
Threaten him that if he does not bring your man back you will cut the throat of his wife and children whom you hold

1078
01:21:54.62 --> 01:21:58.06
Under guard while waiting and that you will have his house burned

1079
01:21:59.74 --> 01:22:05.42
I was obliged to employ this sad expedient in Bohemia and it succeeded for me

1080
01:22:05.42 --> 01:22:15.90
In general does necessary to pay spies well and not to be miserly in that respect a man who risks being hung in your service merits being well paid

1081
01:22:18.06 --> 01:22:20.06
So Frederick the Great

1082
01:22:20.54 --> 01:22:23.58
We know he we know he liked music and literature

1083
01:22:23.58 --> 01:22:29.02
But guess what he was no stranger to just having your family's throat cut and burning the house down

1084
01:22:29.90 --> 01:22:31.90
Yeah ruthless

1085
01:22:31.90 --> 01:22:34.78
So he's saying be well-picked like it's kind of like hey

1086
01:22:35.74 --> 01:22:40.70
If you listen like a carrot in the stick situation where it's like okay if you listen if you're all good

1087
01:22:40.70 --> 01:22:44.70
You get paid well if not you get your house burned down. Yeah kids wife

1088
01:22:45.42 --> 01:22:47.42
Yes, it's good. Yep

1089
01:22:47.58 --> 01:22:52.86
He's saying if you know he's saying if you can use the carrot if the carrot works that's great if you can make someone greedy

1090
01:22:52.86 --> 01:22:56.78
That's like all right, you know what I'll get this information for you because I'm greedy that's cool if you can't get that

1091
01:22:56.78 --> 01:23:01.82
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's kind of give him no choice kind of situation yeah, and

1092
01:23:03.18 --> 01:23:05.98
You know that's what's what's scary about that is that's

1093
01:23:06.22 --> 01:23:11.02
Goes on today. That's what a lot of the geotus would do they would they would kidnap

1094
01:23:11.26 --> 01:23:15.58
When they would they would take someone and say look you either run the suicide bomb in this building or we're gonna

1095
01:23:15.90 --> 01:23:21.02
Kill your family and burn your house down and you know the people make that horrible choice

1096
01:23:21.18 --> 01:23:24.86
Yeah, and that and well even that that's more the sticks

1097
01:23:24.86 --> 01:23:30.46
It's like oh that's complete. Oh, yeah, remember the mom the like apparently the mom like on the mafia

1098
01:23:30.46 --> 01:23:33.10
Movies and stuff they're like hey, they're paying off this guy

1099
01:23:33.10 --> 01:23:38.38
But if he's like if he doesn't want to play the game anymore, then they kill him, you know, it's kind of like that like that right basically

1100
01:23:39.02 --> 01:23:42.54
No, it's two different things so if you can get someone that does

1101
01:23:43.34 --> 01:23:47.42
Will do what you want to do for money that's right. Yeah if you can't get anyone to do that

1102
01:23:47.74 --> 01:23:49.26
Then you got to go yeah

1103
01:23:49.26 --> 01:23:55.34
Yeah, but I guess you're right that someone could say hey, I'm done and then you go. Oh, no, you're not done right

1104
01:23:55.34 --> 01:23:58.54
You're done. Yeah, so you are right. Yeah, the mafia the mafia thing like yeah

1105
01:23:58.54 --> 01:24:00.94
You're gonna you're gonna keep doing this. No

1106
01:24:01.58 --> 01:24:06.06
People getting involved in situations like that that they should have got involved in and it all seems okay

1107
01:24:06.78 --> 01:24:08.22
It all seems okay in the beginning

1108
01:24:08.22 --> 01:24:12.06
Yeah, one side of the other because either side of your criminal or your

1109
01:24:12.46 --> 01:24:16.46
Whether you go to help a criminal or you go to help the cops out like you think it's gonna be hey

1110
01:24:16.46 --> 01:24:21.10
It's just gonna go good. It's not you're gonna end up in a bad situation. You're in a bad way

1111
01:24:21.50 --> 01:24:26.70
So the expression getting into bed with what ever you know, yeah, it's not gonna work out

1112
01:24:27.98 --> 01:24:32.38
I never wanted to be a spy of any kind you never to never wanted to be a spy of any kind

1113
01:24:33.26 --> 01:24:35.26
never watched

1114
01:24:35.90 --> 01:24:38.86
James Bond and it was like I'd really like to do that

1115
01:24:38.86 --> 01:24:46.06
I've never watched a spy movie and thought like I don't know I don't like the I don't like that whole

1116
01:24:48.94 --> 01:24:53.82
Paranoia like on recover cops too. I'm sure we'll get somebody get done deep undercover. Yeah

1117
01:24:53.82 --> 01:24:56.86
I've never had like I don't I want to I don't like that

1118
01:24:56.86 --> 01:25:01.90
Yeah, I don't like to I don't want to fabricate everything like that all the time

1119
01:25:02.30 --> 01:25:06.70
Yes, it's just hard. It's it means props to them like undercover cops. That's a crazy job

1120
01:25:06.70 --> 01:25:10.94
Yeah, imagine it proud imagine going in right you're undercover

1121
01:25:12.70 --> 01:25:14.70
Going and you don't know I think I know

1122
01:25:14.70 --> 01:25:17.90
Oh, no, because that's how right like especially these organized

1123
01:25:18.46 --> 01:25:19.98
Crime bosses

1124
01:25:19.98 --> 01:25:24.46
What is on the movies anyway where when they find out it's like a lot of times they don't just oh

1125
01:25:24.62 --> 01:25:26.46
What is it?

1126
01:25:26.46 --> 01:25:31.98
I said I'm up. Yeah, that's uh I never had the desire to do that some people really like that stuff

1127
01:25:31.98 --> 01:25:33.98
I never had the desire to do that

1128
01:25:33.98 --> 01:25:39.98
I'm a swordfish watch it movie sort of yeah that happens anyway. It's like a cross and a double cross

1129
01:25:41.82 --> 01:25:46.38
We'll talk about that some other time. Yeah, you know what let's let's let's let's tee it up from a talk pass

1130
01:25:46.38 --> 01:25:48.38
Go back to the book. I'm dead

1131
01:25:49.90 --> 01:25:51.90
check

1132
01:25:52.62 --> 01:25:55.34
In neutral countries it is necessary to make friends

1133
01:25:56.46 --> 01:25:59.18
If you can win over the whole country so much the better

1134
01:25:59.18 --> 01:26:05.90
The friendship of the neutral countries gained by requiring the soldier soups serve good discipline and by picturing your enemies as

1135
01:26:06.14 --> 01:26:08.54
Barbraus and bad intention

1136
01:26:09.58 --> 01:26:11.58
Solid solid advice right

1137
01:26:18.06 --> 01:26:20.06
Oh, this is good

1138
01:26:21.42 --> 01:26:28.38
Let no one imagine that it is this that it is sufficient just to move in army about to make the enemy

1139
01:26:28.38 --> 01:26:30.38
Regulate himself on your movements

1140
01:26:32.38 --> 01:26:34.38
So you you can't just thank yourself

1141
01:26:35.10 --> 01:26:36.38
Hey

1142
01:26:36.38 --> 01:26:41.90
My moves are enough and I'm doing and and it's gonna have the impact that I want to have

1143
01:26:44.30 --> 01:26:51.90
A general who is who has two presumptuous confidence in his skills runs the risk of being grossly dupped

1144
01:26:51.90 --> 01:26:59.10
That's what this is don't let your ego get out of control war is not an affair of chance

1145
01:26:59.90 --> 01:27:06.22
A great deal of knowledge study and meditation is necessary to conduct it well and when blows are planned

1146
01:27:06.22 --> 01:27:12.06
Whoever contrives them with the greatest appreciation of their consequences will have a great advantage

1147
01:27:12.06 --> 01:27:23.66
However to give a few rules on such a delicate matter I would say that in general the first of two army commanders

1148
01:27:23.90 --> 01:27:32.62
Who adopts an offensive attitude almost always reduces his rival to the defensive and makes him regulate himself on his movements

1149
01:27:34.06 --> 01:27:37.98
What does that mean means default aggressive it means go that sort of means

1150
01:27:37.98 --> 01:27:45.74
Unskillful generals race to the first trap set before them

1151
01:27:47.42 --> 01:27:49.42
I just had a guy on Twitter say

1152
01:27:51.02 --> 01:27:54.70
I'm a white belt but tonight I swept a blue belt

1153
01:27:55.10 --> 01:28:01.10
It wasn't really that good though cuz he armed locked me quickly thereafter. I was like you got a sweep him you got set up

1154
01:28:01.10 --> 01:28:09.74
Yeah, you did do so same thing don't race for the first trap that's set before you this is why a great advantage is drawn from knowledge of your adversary

1155
01:28:09.74 --> 01:28:15.02
And when you know his intelligence and character you can use it to play on his weaknesses

1156
01:28:17.18 --> 01:28:21.42
Everything which the enemy least six specks will succeed the best

1157
01:28:25.42 --> 01:28:27.42
That's true a hundred percent

1158
01:28:27.42 --> 01:28:32.22
That's why when you get like when you think about when you get caught gj to

1159
01:28:33.82 --> 01:28:39.66
I would say most of the time it's getting caught with something that you didn't expect right some people

1160
01:28:40.46 --> 01:28:44.54
Dean can do things and like he's gonna get it and you know it's coming like you hear a Hicks and stories

1161
01:28:44.78 --> 01:28:50.14
Hicks and be like I'm gonna arm lock everyone's left arm and they'd line up 20 black belts need arm lock everyone's left arm

1162
01:28:51.90 --> 01:28:53.90
But most of the time

1163
01:28:53.90 --> 01:29:00.86
It's something that you least expect yeah and and there's kind of two things and I think we're strange

1164
01:29:00.86 --> 01:29:04.86
I was just thinking about this yesterday with it's like there's two kind of ways

1165
01:29:05.66 --> 01:29:10.38
Where you'll get caught so if you want to use Dean as the example and then the the unexpected example

1166
01:29:11.18 --> 01:29:15.10
If you get caught in someone by someone like when Dean does that where's like oh I'm gonna get you with this

1167
01:29:15.34 --> 01:29:19.66
What he does is the equivalent of let's say like I don't know you he might not literally say that

1168
01:29:19.66 --> 01:29:25.26
But you know it's coming I mean I do this to you right where you're like oh he's good about to come here to me. Yeah, like you know it's coming

1169
01:29:25.26 --> 01:29:29.74
Yeah, yeah, so that's the situation that we're talking about. Yes example one yes

1170
01:29:29.74 --> 01:29:33.26
So it's like okay if you're on the battlefield or whatever you have a defense here

1171
01:29:33.26 --> 01:29:37.90
You know a defensive position there a defensive position there a defensive position there and they're all protecting

1172
01:29:38.30 --> 01:29:42.94
Ultimately like one guy's protecting this guy this guy's protecting this guy and this guy, you know kind of thing

1173
01:29:42.94 --> 01:29:45.02
So it's like you can't get to this guy with that

1174
01:29:45.02 --> 01:29:52.30
What's going through this situation right and what Dean essentially does is he shuts down all your defenses for this thing to move the

1175
01:29:52.30 --> 01:29:55.66
Heads so yeah, yeah, it's like okay. I'm gonna try to pass the guard

1176
01:29:55.66 --> 01:30:00.38
But that's the guard how's he gonna defend so he shuts that down before you even realize like oh yeah

1177
01:30:00.38 --> 01:30:04.54
That he's gonna try to pass these are a few steps ahead. Yes, so when he goes for these

1178
01:30:04.54 --> 01:30:08.86
When I'm getting the camera on you it's not the camera itself that got you it was

1179
01:30:08.86 --> 01:30:14.54
I didn't go when you left your arm out and I saladed it because I was going for a choke and I end up doing that

1180
01:30:14.54 --> 01:30:18.14
Yes, and then your other arms tied up under your heaviest knee

1181
01:30:18.62 --> 01:30:22.34
Because that's part of the defense, but you already knew that two musical you already knew that

1182
01:30:22.34 --> 01:30:25.26
So that you shut those down and that's what Dean's good at a lot of time

1183
01:30:25.34 --> 01:30:31.42
Especially as any as that we're good like pressure. Oh, yeah, so if your arm is like isolated since you

1184
01:30:31.42 --> 01:30:33.42
Don't really detect like

1185
01:30:33.42 --> 01:30:39.90
Immediate threat you like dang my arm stuck, but hey, that's not it's kind of okay for right now. I'll do it with it later

1186
01:30:39.90 --> 01:30:43.02
But here's the thing no you're not gonna do it later. He just took care of that

1187
01:30:43.58 --> 01:30:48.38
Defense that you're gonna need by the way and it's gone and then you know that you need it yet

1188
01:30:49.50 --> 01:30:51.98
In 20 seconds in the future but he already

1189
01:30:52.22 --> 01:30:57.02
Eliminate that exactly right and that's the way it works there and the other ones are just like how you're saying

1190
01:30:57.02 --> 01:31:03.34
Where it's kind of like you know you attack this sweep and the arm bar and when they go to defend one or even both of

1191
01:31:03.34 --> 01:31:06.94
A lot of times because they're ready for it, you know you went for the thing that you planned or it didn't

1192
01:31:06.94 --> 01:31:10.06
Does that Dean does that one like let someone try and

1193
01:31:10.62 --> 01:31:16.94
Armlock him or let him try and triangle and like they're 100% not gonna armlock him. Yeah, but even me

1194
01:31:16.94 --> 01:31:18.94
I'll be like I get it. It's about five

1195
01:31:20.30 --> 01:31:26.54
He continues on here back to the book if you realize for security on a chain of mountains that he believes is impracticable

1196
01:31:27.26 --> 01:31:33.10
And you pass these mountains by roads unknown to him. He is confused to start with and if you press him

1197
01:31:33.10 --> 01:31:36.14
He will not have time to recover from his consternation

1198
01:31:36.22 --> 01:31:40.86
That's actually a really good description of just you right there like you're just confused it

1199
01:31:40.86 --> 01:31:46.30
But by the time you're trying to overcome your confusion and your concern you're getting crushed

1200
01:31:47.18 --> 01:31:52.86
In the same way if he places himself behind a river to defend the crossing and you find some forward above or below

1201
01:31:52.86 --> 01:32:03.58
Which he which on which to cross unknown to him this will surprise and deranged him and confuse him. I like that

1202
01:32:03.26 --> 01:32:08.78
The art of war is divided between force and strategy

1203
01:32:10.06 --> 01:32:16.62
What cannot be done by force must be done by strategy and I actually was kind of

1204
01:32:16.62 --> 01:32:25.10
Unclear about the usage of the word strategy and there's meanings of it to clarify the meaning a little bit more specifically

1205
01:32:25.10 --> 01:32:27.10
It's means like

1206
01:32:26.86 --> 01:32:29.10
Disception but trickery

1207
01:32:29.10 --> 01:32:31.10
It just doesn't mean strategy means like

1208
01:32:31.82 --> 01:32:38.94
This is a trick scenario. Yeah kind of seemed like the root word of what strategy kind of maybe came from well

1209
01:32:38.94 --> 01:32:40.94
Yeah, I would definitely say that

1210
01:32:41.50 --> 01:32:43.50
It's the same

1211
01:32:43.50 --> 01:32:45.50
So I'd say you failed that one

1212
01:32:47.18 --> 01:32:50.42
Hold on let me redo that that's a good point. Yeah, yeah

1213
01:32:53.42 --> 01:32:55.42
I didn't see that thank you

1214
01:32:57.42 --> 01:32:59.38
See sometimes I don't fall in my own

1215
01:32:59.38 --> 01:33:02.06
That was one of them huh? No, I'm right up just

1216
01:33:02.30 --> 01:33:06.78
How can a dagger at you? Is it that an exception though because you know how like everything you know

1217
01:33:06.78 --> 01:33:08.14
You can do something too much

1218
01:33:08.14 --> 01:33:14.62
Like you know like if you're that we're encouraging me. I'm passing out dumb. I'll be a stuff. You know all the kind of strategy

1219
01:33:15.98 --> 01:33:17.98
Yes exactly

1220
01:33:17.98 --> 01:33:20.46
That's why I didn't try and fake it you know I can't do real

1221
01:33:20.94 --> 01:33:27.42
You're gonna get a kill the dead economy man. They can't have check have your disposition supported well

1222
01:33:28.06 --> 01:33:30.06
Do not forget your reserves

1223
01:33:31.34 --> 01:33:34.54
Take advantage of the terrain and then attack him

1224
01:33:34.54 --> 01:33:40.70
Bruscally and you should be able to hope for the most brilliant success if the heights are on your side

1225
01:33:40.70 --> 01:33:47.34
This will be of great advantage to you if they are not you have almost no hope of succeeding take the high ground

1226
01:33:47.66 --> 01:33:49.66
Or the high ground will take you

1227
01:33:49.66 --> 01:33:51.66
Something that's been talked about

1228
01:33:54.38 --> 01:33:59.90
Now he's talking about attacking the enemies in trenchman so the enemies in a defended position

1229
01:33:59.90 --> 01:34:07.18
If you have resolved to an attack an entrenched enemy do it at once and do not allow him to

1230
01:34:07.42 --> 01:34:09.42
Time to perfect his works

1231
01:34:09.66 --> 01:34:13.66
So if you know you're gonna have to defend attack a defended position do it as quick as you can

1232
01:34:13.90 --> 01:34:15.50
Don't let them

1233
01:34:15.50 --> 01:34:17.50
Get their defenses all set up

1234
01:34:18.54 --> 01:34:21.18
That's something that a lot of G.T. players

1235
01:34:22.38 --> 01:34:24.38
They

1236
01:34:24.38 --> 01:34:31.98
Especially I would say it's kind of the same thing but if you pass my guard I don't wait until you settle me across the side before I start escaping

1237
01:34:32.22 --> 01:34:35.34
As soon as I know I'm gonna lose that position

1238
01:34:35.90 --> 01:34:37.90
I'm already escaping and

1239
01:34:38.38 --> 01:34:42.78
Same thing if I pass your guard and then I let you get in your defense position

1240
01:34:42.78 --> 01:34:46.14
Well, it's gonna be hard to yank your arm out of there, but there's a moment where your arms hang it out

1241
01:34:46.14 --> 01:34:49.90
And if I go for it right then my probability for success is a lot higher

1242
01:34:49.90 --> 01:34:55.34
Yeah, you got all mad one time like a couple months ago because I did that to you

1243
01:34:55.34 --> 01:35:00.86
I like pass you go wham on lock and you and you were it was a straight there's something that bothered you about it

1244
01:35:00.86 --> 01:35:05.50
Yeah, emotionally. I don't know what it was. Oh, I could tell you I'm a reenact or a recount

1245
01:35:05.98 --> 01:35:09.74
The account yeah, so I said to you

1246
01:35:10.38 --> 01:35:15.42
I said you know what because you kept getting me with the guilty and I said to you kind of

1247
01:35:15.42 --> 01:35:25.58
I'm even the lie said this but I did say that I said I think I got my defense against your kimura and arm lock like your other arm moves

1248
01:35:25.58 --> 01:35:31.02
I think I got that dot. I think I'm solid with those defending those but the guilty and I'm still, you know trying to figure out

1249
01:35:31.02 --> 01:35:37.10
I said something I said that basically and you were like oh, okay? Oh, yeah, and then because I

1250
01:35:37.10 --> 01:35:46.54
Yeah, and yeah, and then you went in a little bit, you know more sense of urgency or whatever and it was an arm bar that you did

1251
01:35:46.54 --> 01:35:50.86
That was almost of a would have been a flying arm bar except it was done with in a scramble

1252
01:35:50.86 --> 01:35:55.58
Yeah, so like you kind of did a little guard pass and you went to and yeah, it came out of nowhere

1253
01:35:56.14 --> 01:36:00.46
You shouldn't have been capable of doing that in my opinion at the time. What opened the game up?

1254
01:36:00.46 --> 01:36:03.26
Sometimes I could open the game up a little bit. Yes, you did sure

1255
01:36:03.26 --> 01:36:07.66
That's exactly what I love that I love that part of Gjitsu

1256
01:36:08.46 --> 01:36:10.78
I love that part of Gjitsu where you're going like

1257
01:36:11.42 --> 01:36:14.94
Getting after I've been training with Andy Hard and we've been both been opening up the game

1258
01:36:14.94 --> 01:36:19.98
Are you to train with Dean like this all the time we just didn't care suicide every move was a suicide move

1259
01:36:20.30 --> 01:36:23.26
Like hey, I might just die after I do this move, but I'm gonna do it anything

1260
01:36:23.26 --> 01:36:28.54
Yeah, yeah, but good and you just watch you which is be like a like a like a Tasmania and Devil

1261
01:36:28.54 --> 01:36:35.10
Just stuff going on. Yeah, I'm trying to train like that again right now. Yeah, and that's good because it's so fun in a way

1262
01:36:35.10 --> 01:36:38.94
You start to it's almost like you guys are both doing

1263
01:36:39.42 --> 01:36:44.14
Offense encounters is what you do you're not really defending technically much exactly you know

1264
01:36:44.14 --> 01:36:48.94
You're just going for something. Yeah, he's going for something. Okay, because most things have a counter to it

1265
01:36:48.94 --> 01:36:54.62
You know kind of thing and you're just thinking like it's a real forward thinking like dynamic. Yeah, yeah, it is

1266
01:36:54.62 --> 01:36:58.62
This is fun. It's good. Yeah, and so point being

1267
01:36:59.90 --> 01:37:06.70
Once you get a little advantage on the enemy take advantage of it don't let them reset and reset

1268
01:37:07.34 --> 01:37:12.54
Go get a little advantage on your competitor go tell him apart a tack harder

1269
01:37:16.14 --> 01:37:23.42
It is the generals Kudeya that must decide this if you attack a bull by the horns

1270
01:37:23.42 --> 01:37:27.50
Your task will be difficult and perhaps will not succeed at all

1271
01:37:28.14 --> 01:37:30.14
Attack a weak position make sense

1272
01:37:31.90 --> 01:37:36.14
And now he starts talking about so when he talked about attacking an entrenchment or defense position

1273
01:37:36.14 --> 01:37:41.82
Now he's talking about setting up a defensive position and he says as I have already said and I repeat it

1274
01:37:42.14 --> 01:37:47.82
That I would never put myself in an entrenchment at least unless a terrible misfortune

1275
01:37:47.82 --> 01:37:53.90
Such as the loss of a battle or a triple superiority on the part of the enemy forced me to do it

1276
01:37:54.38 --> 01:37:58.14
So he's not gonna dig in and try and defend he's gonna be on offense all the time

1277
01:37:58.14 --> 01:38:00.38
You know, this is really essentially what the guard is

1278
01:38:01.18 --> 01:38:05.58
People think you know you shouldn't be on the bottom in the guard that's a disadvantage

1279
01:38:05.98 --> 01:38:09.90
It's disadvantage you would rather be on top and if you end up in the guard

1280
01:38:09.90 --> 01:38:18.06
Well, that's because you ended up there by some gross misfortune of your own doing most likely or your other person now

1281
01:38:18.06 --> 01:38:23.50
Have there are there some people out there that absolutely have a guard that's so crazy and offensive

1282
01:38:23.74 --> 01:38:30.86
That it's be it's kind of morph that a little bit. Yeah, yes, that is true. Yeah, and then there's some people in combat

1283
01:38:31.82 --> 01:38:39.18
That are so good at defending positions that they make it well look at the Russians that they're their whole strategy

1284
01:38:39.18 --> 01:38:42.14
Is basically pulling guard like yeah, okay

1285
01:38:42.38 --> 01:38:47.82
You come this way a little bit because what's where do you spend more gas defending guard or passing guard?

1286
01:38:49.66 --> 01:38:53.58
Passing guard me too for sure. Yeah, trying to pass guard is way more

1287
01:38:54.30 --> 01:38:55.34
Energy

1288
01:38:55.34 --> 01:38:57.98
Draw draws way more energy trying to pass them

1289
01:38:59.18 --> 01:39:02.54
And when you're just when you're just holding and you're adjust your hips and you adjust your hips

1290
01:39:02.78 --> 01:39:05.66
Well, that's what the Russians do so their guard is just really really good

1291
01:39:05.66 --> 01:39:10.38
They they tax you a little bit and move back. They tax you a little bit move back. They tax you a little bit move back. They tax you a little bit move back

1292
01:39:10.38 --> 01:39:14.94
Mm-hmm and by the time you get there you're exhausted. Hmm. Just you get caught

1293
01:39:17.58 --> 01:39:19.58
Um

1294
01:39:21.34 --> 01:39:26.38
If you are inferior in numbers do not despair of winning

1295
01:39:27.02 --> 01:39:29.26
But do not expect any other success

1296
01:39:29.26 --> 01:39:35.98
Then gained by your skill so you can win when you're outnumbered, but you better have some serious skill

1297
01:39:39.58 --> 01:39:44.70
There are some generals who maintain that an army in position should be attacked in the center as for me

1298
01:39:44.70 --> 01:39:47.90
I am of the opinion that it should be attacked at the weakest point

1299
01:39:49.26 --> 01:39:54.94
They say that in breaking the center you separate the entire army in place yourself in a situation to gain the most brilliant

1300
01:39:54.94 --> 01:39:59.90
Inventages as for me. I repeat it. I approve of all methods of attacking

1301
01:40:00.46 --> 01:40:08.78
Provided they are directed at the point where the enemies army is the weakest and where the terrain favors them the least

1302
01:40:11.90 --> 01:40:13.90
Attack weak points

1303
01:40:14.14 --> 01:40:16.14
Boom

1304
01:40:17.98 --> 01:40:22.14
This is important the defensive positions is again. He's talking about defense a little bit more

1305
01:40:22.14 --> 01:40:29.66
I would choose only on a sailor bull positions or else I would not occupy them at all

1306
01:40:30.78 --> 01:40:35.50
For we have too many advantages in attacking to deprive ourselves of them gratuitously

1307
01:40:35.98 --> 01:40:41.66
Let me tell you what I took away away from that. This is something that I do all the time and it might it's like no big deal

1308
01:40:41.98 --> 01:40:44.62
It's no big deal, but when you think about it, it's it's important

1309
01:40:44.62 --> 01:40:53.02
I choose I would only choose on a sailor bull positions or else I would not occupy them at all. What does that mean to me? What that means is

1310
01:40:53.82 --> 01:40:56.22
If I don't know something a hundred percent

1311
01:40:56.78 --> 01:41:04.78
I don't try and defend it with a hundred percent strength. I see this all the time with businesses with human beings with people

1312
01:41:06.46 --> 01:41:11.74
They they're not they don't know something a hundred percent, but they're gonna they're gonna fall on their sword because of it

1313
01:41:11.74 --> 01:41:18.22
And it's a total mistake. There's there's very few things that I feel so

1314
01:41:19.34 --> 01:41:25.02
knowledgeable about and I have such a good position on that my position is unassailable

1315
01:41:26.14 --> 01:41:31.74
So why it doesn't take a it doesn't it doesn't you're not a bad person if you go you know

1316
01:41:31.74 --> 01:41:35.58
I'm not a hundred percent sure on that. Yeah, here's my opinion, but it's just an opinion

1317
01:41:37.34 --> 01:41:39.34
Look at people better

1318
01:41:39.34 --> 01:41:42.14
Okay, well the minute you throw down

1319
01:41:43.50 --> 01:41:49.18
And you're in a position that is a sailor bull meaning you can get your your butt kicked

1320
01:41:49.18 --> 01:41:54.94
Well then guess what you will someone's gonna come and do it. Yeah, so just keep it over mind don't don't

1321
01:41:55.42 --> 01:42:00.70
Hunker down on positions that you're not even sure about yeah, there you go. Yeah, seems logical

1322
01:42:00.94 --> 01:42:03.50
But here's what's hard. I think is because

1323
01:42:03.50 --> 01:42:10.06
Usually that's in like some kind of me against you situation and I'm talking about obviously with just normal people

1324
01:42:10.06 --> 01:42:14.70
Usually it's like some sort of a debate that you get into with somebody about something and

1325
01:42:15.42 --> 01:42:16.78
And

1326
01:42:16.78 --> 01:42:19.66
It turns into this okay, it's me against you. I'm right you're wrong

1327
01:42:20.22 --> 01:42:25.58
Versus you're right in I'm wrong kind of thing and it just turns into that so now it's like now is kind of some part in their brain

1328
01:42:25.58 --> 01:42:27.90
Kind of things okay if I say hey, I'm not really sure

1329
01:42:27.90 --> 01:42:32.86
I just gave up the battle. I just gave up. Yeah, this whole battle that kind of started and don't start there

1330
01:42:32.86 --> 01:42:36.22
The key part of this is don't start with I'm right in your room

1331
01:42:36.22 --> 01:42:41.50
Yeah, I'm not too infirm about this subject. Can you film me? Yeah, and by the way the more you talk as we learned

1332
01:42:42.30 --> 01:42:47.26
The more you talk the more I know about your position and my position. Yeah, I'm gonna let you talk

1333
01:42:48.46 --> 01:42:54.22
But that is given the given the fact or given the circumstance that your brain your mind is in

1334
01:42:54.22 --> 01:42:59.50
In a me against you mode. Yes, because you don't walk around in that mode that there is the the

1335
01:42:59.50 --> 01:43:06.22
Mist that there's a there's a little dichotomy there too. You want to know why because I'm always me against you

1336
01:43:06.22 --> 01:43:09.98
I'm me against everyone yeah, but the way I actually win against you is to not

1337
01:43:10.54 --> 01:43:16.06
Defended an unassailable position. Yeah, that's how I actually win and you have this thing where you're that's

1338
01:43:16.06 --> 01:43:18.06
That's that's important

1339
01:43:18.06 --> 01:43:27.34
Important. Yes, yeah, and that's not to mention how you always have while you seem to always have this mindset of like the bigger picture like a big

1340
01:43:27.34 --> 01:43:30.54
You know how you say like you don't necessarily you're not focused on little battles

1341
01:43:30.54 --> 01:43:33.34
I'll attend your more folks in the world so a little something we called it

1342
01:43:33.34 --> 01:43:38.14
Datched yeah, I don't really care about the thing that you're actually fired up about I don't actually care

1343
01:43:38.14 --> 01:43:43.18
Yeah, I care about a little time. Maybe I only care about how it's gonna affect the long term outcome of this broad strategy that I'm over here

1344
01:43:43.18 --> 01:43:45.18
Executed

1345
01:43:45.18 --> 01:43:47.18
Yes, so see how you're

1346
01:43:47.74 --> 01:43:55.10
You seem to be always aware of that. There's the missed up. I think that people they get what you call it when you get sucked in

1347
01:43:55.10 --> 01:43:59.58
Target fixation. Yeah, yeah exactly right for sure. That's not easy thing to just not do

1348
01:43:59.58 --> 01:44:04.54
I'm just not gonna do it. You know, it's not that easy man. Whatever. You know for you though, I get

1349
01:44:06.14 --> 01:44:09.10
Back to the book. I have not spoken yet of the reserve

1350
01:44:09.34 --> 01:44:14.70
It should be commanded by a skillful general and it should be placed in a locality where he can see everything

1351
01:44:14.78 --> 01:44:20.22
So the reason I brought this up is to again counteract something he said in the beginning of the book which is right here

1352
01:44:21.10 --> 01:44:23.74
He should act on his own initiative

1353
01:44:23.74 --> 01:44:29.58
And if he sees that one of the wings are a need of help he should conduct a reserve there without being called so again

1354
01:44:29.58 --> 01:44:34.78
It much he says here. When we listen to me. Oh, babe. That's his macho statement the reality is he wants is

1355
01:44:35.18 --> 01:44:40.70
He wants his reserve leader to like step up and make things happen without being told that decentralized command

1356
01:44:42.78 --> 01:44:44.78
That's how it has to be

1357
01:44:45.74 --> 01:44:48.70
I like this what is practiced in armies

1358
01:44:49.50 --> 01:44:51.98
Is done on a small scale with detachments

1359
01:44:51.98 --> 01:44:59.50
So you got you got your big army they do the same thing that the little elements out there in the field do what's my primary example this

1360
01:45:00.06 --> 01:45:01.42
Cover move

1361
01:45:01.42 --> 01:45:04.30
So when he says detachments he means just means small little

1362
01:45:05.02 --> 01:45:06.94
Be careful, sharp yeah a company

1363
01:45:06.94 --> 01:45:08.38
Oppul to him in a battalion

1364
01:45:08.38 --> 01:45:12.30
Got you there out there doing the same thing that the army's doing that the big

1365
01:45:13.02 --> 01:45:15.02
Regiment divisions doing

1366
01:45:16.86 --> 01:45:19.58
Here's a good one a battle is lost less

1367
01:45:19.58 --> 01:45:21.58
Less through the loss of men

1368
01:45:23.02 --> 01:45:25.02
Then by discouragement

1369
01:45:26.62 --> 01:45:28.62
Remember that one

1370
01:45:28.62 --> 01:45:35.90
The another one the man who does things without motive or in spite of himself is either insane or a fool

1371
01:45:37.74 --> 01:45:42.14
War is decided only by battles and it is not finished except by them

1372
01:45:43.66 --> 01:45:47.18
Thus they have to be fought but it should be done

1373
01:45:47.18 --> 01:45:52.86
But it should be opportune and with all the advantages on your side

1374
01:45:55.66 --> 01:45:57.66
concur

1375
01:45:58.62 --> 01:46:00.30
Here's here's a good little section

1376
01:46:00.30 --> 01:46:03.66
Reflections on the hazards and misfortunes of war

1377
01:46:04.62 --> 01:46:10.22
When a general conducts himself with all prudence he can still suffer ill fortune

1378
01:46:11.10 --> 01:46:15.82
For how many things do not cooperate at all with his labors?

1379
01:46:15.82 --> 01:46:17.82
So yeah things are gonna go bad

1380
01:46:18.62 --> 01:46:22.86
Weather harvest the officers the health or sickness of his troops

1381
01:46:23.26 --> 01:46:27.82
Blunders the death of an officer on whom he counts discouragement of the troops

1382
01:46:28.14 --> 01:46:34.54
Exposure of your spies negligence of the officers who should record recorder the enemy and finally betrayal

1383
01:46:36.06 --> 01:46:39.42
These are the things that should be kept continually before your eyes

1384
01:46:39.42 --> 01:46:45.34
So as to be prepared for them and so that good fortune will not blind us

1385
01:46:49.42 --> 01:46:52.94
You cannot be blinded by good fortune. You're gonna get lucky sometimes

1386
01:46:55.98 --> 01:47:04.46
He goes on about this more if an important detachment is entrusted to a man of judgment and if this man should become sick or should be killed

1387
01:47:04.94 --> 01:47:06.94
There is all your business hung up

1388
01:47:06.94 --> 01:47:12.06
For no one should imagine that sound heads are common in armies

1389
01:47:13.74 --> 01:47:16.22
Yeah, guess what? It's really hard to find good leaders

1390
01:47:17.98 --> 01:47:22.78
Offensive generals are rare among us. I only know a few and nevertheless

1391
01:47:23.34 --> 01:47:27.26
It is only to these that this sort of detachment can be entrusted

1392
01:47:28.06 --> 01:47:30.06
It's talking about aggressive

1393
01:47:30.54 --> 01:47:34.38
When he says offensive general he means aggressive generals people are gonna make things happen

1394
01:47:34.38 --> 01:47:41.82
It's so good. You know if you're like a young person or an old person or your person listening to this

1395
01:47:43.18 --> 01:47:48.30
If you can make things happen, yeah, it's like incredible and you will go far in life

1396
01:47:49.10 --> 01:47:53.42
If you sit back and you wait for things to happen, it's not good and you won't go far in life

1397
01:47:54.14 --> 01:47:57.50
Nothing is gonna just happen because you

1398
01:47:57.50 --> 01:48:02.70
Helgif you cross your fingers. It doesn't make anything happen. You have to make it happen

1399
01:48:05.50 --> 01:48:09.26
You have to be an aggressive general and they're rare

1400
01:48:10.06 --> 01:48:13.02
Is like you know what there's actually not even any competition

1401
01:48:13.82 --> 01:48:19.10
Like there's no competition for it like if you're you're there you are such hide if you're a person that can make things happen

1402
01:48:19.10 --> 01:48:22.46
You are in such high demand you're gonna you're gonna be set yeah

1403
01:48:22.46 --> 01:48:27.66
There's just not that many people that will make things happen. Yeah, and if you're one of them you're gonna do great

1404
01:48:28.06 --> 01:48:32.30
Yeah, that's too huh and you and my saying they got a step on toes and you got to be all

1405
01:48:32.54 --> 01:48:36.46
Agrow and Matt, macho and run around no I'm not saying that but you make things happen

1406
01:48:36.46 --> 01:48:42.62
You do it tactfully and you're smart you do the skies a limit. Yeah, because it's not like this just this over

1407
01:48:42.86 --> 01:48:46.94
Abundance of people making hey I work with businesses all the time

1408
01:48:46.94 --> 01:48:53.34
The the every every single business I work with is looking for good people that are gonna make things happen

1409
01:48:53.66 --> 01:48:58.06
Yeah, that's just all of them 100% I never went to a business there like oh yeah luckily

1410
01:48:58.06 --> 01:49:01.82
Everyone here we're maxed out with people that good good people that make things happen

1411
01:49:01.82 --> 01:49:04.06
Yeah, then that's too many oh yeah

1412
01:49:04.94 --> 01:49:08.70
So big person that makes things happen. Yeah, and there's a difference

1413
01:49:10.78 --> 01:49:16.06
As far as what I can tell there's a difference between someone who's grinding and working real hard at it

1414
01:49:16.06 --> 01:49:20.30
And then some of who makes it happen because like okay when you kind of make it happen sure that usually takes work

1415
01:49:20.30 --> 01:49:23.90
It did get but at the end of the day is like they're straight up results

1416
01:49:24.46 --> 01:49:28.06
Yeah, no the guy who's sort of just works hard the guy that works hard school too

1417
01:49:28.30 --> 01:49:31.90
But there's a difference you're right there's being some of that just makes things happen

1418
01:49:31.90 --> 01:49:33.90
Yeah, and they'll do whatever

1419
01:49:33.90 --> 01:49:36.30
Nobody thinks happened they'll work hard they'll grind hard

1420
01:49:36.30 --> 01:49:41.10
No maneuver they'll go back they'll read they'll read they'll revisit the whole plan

1421
01:49:41.50 --> 01:49:44.62
Yeah, to get the result making it happen. Yeah, we're gonna make it happen

1422
01:49:44.62 --> 01:49:48.54
Yeah, remember to tell the story about finding wine for my brother. Oh

1423
01:49:48.86 --> 01:49:53.50
Yeah, we're gonna start that that was the kind of the I know terrible example

1424
01:49:53.50 --> 01:49:59.90
I know but at it's core it's the same thing you ever see wine. I'll it's huge and you're like you easily could say hey

1425
01:50:01.10 --> 01:50:03.58
I didn't have that much time or whatever you just made it

1426
01:50:05.58 --> 01:50:08.22
I don't care I'll be the one of those people

1427
01:50:08.22 --> 01:50:14.38
I'm starting I'm beginning I'm in the beginning I'm on all it's

1428
01:50:14.38 --> 01:50:16.38
Yes, there's this

1429
01:50:17.58 --> 01:50:19.58
Okay speaking of

1430
01:50:19.58 --> 01:50:26.46
Things happening by luck kind of mentioned that in considering for two to some events and the chapter of accidents

1431
01:50:26.78 --> 01:50:33.90
One can see that a general should be skillful and lucky and that no one should believe so fully in his star

1432
01:50:33.90 --> 01:50:43.66
That he abandoned himself to it blindly if you are lucky and trust in luck alone even if your success reduces you to the defensive

1433
01:50:44.06 --> 01:50:46.06
If you are unlucky

1434
01:50:46.06 --> 01:50:48.06
You're already there

1435
01:50:48.54 --> 01:50:54.70
So if you're counting on luck you're already on the defensive and if you're unlucky you're already on

1436
01:50:56.46 --> 01:51:01.74
And you know what I said to that is make your luck. That's what I say. Yeah, get out there make your luck

1437
01:51:01.74 --> 01:51:03.02
Yeah

1438
01:51:03.02 --> 01:51:08.54
You will have seen by what I have occasion to delineate concerning war that

1439
01:51:08.94 --> 01:51:10.54
Promptness

1440
01:51:10.54 --> 01:51:12.54
And by prompt us he's talking about speed

1441
01:51:13.50 --> 01:51:14.54
Promptness

1442
01:51:14.54 --> 01:51:21.58
Contributes a great deal to success in marches and even more in battles that is why our army is drilled and such

1443
01:51:21.58 --> 01:51:23.90
Fashion than it acts faster than others

1444
01:51:26.38 --> 01:51:28.54
Violence of action is what they status in the field names

1445
01:51:28.54 --> 01:51:33.58
How cool is it when you're 19 years old and you're getting taught about violence of action?

1446
01:51:34.46 --> 01:51:39.82
Yeah, seems pretty cool. If I heard this podcast and I was 18 years old and I heard someone saying when you got to this

1447
01:51:39.82 --> 01:51:43.02
Healtames you get taught about violence of action. I would go assign up a movie

1448
01:51:45.74 --> 01:51:48.22
Yeah violence of action like go hard now

1449
01:51:49.42 --> 01:51:51.42
That's what he's talking about he calls it promptness

1450
01:51:51.82 --> 01:51:54.38
But we don't call it calmness recall a violence of action

1451
01:51:54.38 --> 01:52:01.10
Yeah, from drill these maneuvers which enable us to form in the twinkling of an eye

1452
01:52:01.82 --> 01:52:06.06
And from this that speed in all cavalry moments

1453
01:52:06.70 --> 01:52:11.98
So again when I got to the seal teams they didn't say hey you need to learn to be able to move in the twinkling of an eye

1454
01:52:12.54 --> 01:52:16.06
I wouldn't have been what have been now with that no no violence of action

1455
01:52:17.26 --> 01:52:19.26
That's what's important

1456
01:52:19.58 --> 01:52:22.46
As for any that was talking about cavalry now he talks about

1457
01:52:22.46 --> 01:52:27.50
On foot as for the rapid step of the infantry and the attack

1458
01:52:28.30 --> 01:52:33.98
It is not it is not the greater or lesser number of dead that decides an action

1459
01:52:33.98 --> 01:52:37.02
But the ground you gain it is not the fire

1460
01:52:37.50 --> 01:52:44.46
But the bearing which defeats the enemy. The reason it's not like the the shooting that does it. It's how aggressive you are

1461
01:52:45.34 --> 01:52:50.86
And so now there's a caveat to that which is like fire superiority is a real thing

1462
01:52:50.86 --> 01:52:56.06
And if you've been on the wrong side of supfire superiority you're not winning anything

1463
01:52:57.50 --> 01:52:59.50
But if you get aggressive

1464
01:52:59.90 --> 01:53:05.74
Then that is the one of the most powerful things on the battlefield and that's exactly how you overcome

1465
01:53:05.98 --> 01:53:11.58
When when you when someone else has superior firepower on you or fire superiority on you the way you won't

1466
01:53:11.58 --> 01:53:15.66
Recomment is by aggressive action by sending out someone to a flank and and

1467
01:53:15.66 --> 01:53:20.22
Do something aggressive move that's what you have to do that's what you do to get out of there

1468
01:53:20.22 --> 01:53:25.42
And they taught us that's another thing they taught so you get ambush. Do you get someone's got fire superiority? What do you do you attack?

1469
01:53:26.06 --> 01:53:28.06
That's you you attack

1470
01:53:31.02 --> 01:53:33.02
Still recommend that

1471
01:53:37.66 --> 01:53:41.50
And a couple more thoughts here for a Fredrick the great

1472
01:53:41.50 --> 01:53:48.22
The general should make sure that new uniforms for the army arrive in time towards spring

1473
01:53:48.78 --> 01:53:53.10
That the captains provide shoes that the wagons can and carriages etc

1474
01:53:53.58 --> 01:53:58.30
Of the army are repaired as well as the saddles and boots of the cavalry in a word

1475
01:53:58.70 --> 01:54:04.70
He should enter into all these details and himself visit the corners to see what is going on there

1476
01:54:04.70 --> 01:54:11.42
If the officers are drilling the recruits if they are working and to animate them with kind words

1477
01:54:12.54 --> 01:54:16.30
And reprimands to make them do their duty. So he's a guy that gets in there

1478
01:54:17.58 --> 01:54:19.58
You know that makes things happen

1479
01:54:20.14 --> 01:54:25.98
As we've been talking about and he's also a person that really takes care of his people make sure that they are taken care of

1480
01:54:27.42 --> 01:54:30.14
If you take care of your people your people are gonna take care of you

1481
01:54:30.14 --> 01:54:35.10
He closes out and closes out the Frederick the Greats

1482
01:54:36.94 --> 01:54:43.26
Foughts right here. I'd affect something close on there's a lot of stuff but I figured this one would what do a decent job

1483
01:54:44.78 --> 01:54:47.90
It should be said to the shame of young men

1484
01:54:49.10 --> 01:54:54.22
That debotry and laziness often make them prefer ease

1485
01:54:54.22 --> 01:54:58.22
To glory

1486
01:54:59.90 --> 01:55:01.90
Boom

1487
01:55:02.86 --> 01:55:07.02
So there you go and obviously once again

1488
01:55:08.54 --> 01:55:17.26
I think we see that leadership is leadership is leadership and in different times and different places and different battles and different circumstances

1489
01:55:18.38 --> 01:55:21.18
The fundamental principles do not change

1490
01:55:21.18 --> 01:55:27.34
They do not change and we do see them with different angles and he see different nuances and

1491
01:55:28.22 --> 01:55:34.14
That provides us the ability to understand them with greater depth

1492
01:55:37.26 --> 01:55:42.86
So that so that we can become better leaders is what I'm talking about here not

1493
01:55:43.42 --> 01:55:46.14
Maybe not maybe not as great as Frederick the Great

1494
01:55:46.14 --> 01:55:49.34
Maybe but if we become better leaders

1495
01:55:50.14 --> 01:55:55.50
We can take better care of our teams and if we take care of our teams our teams will take care of us and that

1496
01:55:57.58 --> 01:55:59.58
Is what leadership is

1497
01:55:59.58 --> 01:56:01.58
Frederick the Great

1498
01:56:03.34 --> 01:56:04.94
Now

1499
01:56:04.94 --> 01:56:06.94
We make this podcast

1500
01:56:07.82 --> 01:56:12.14
So that we can learn and I learn a lot from this podcast me myself

1501
01:56:12.14 --> 01:56:18.94
And we also do it on the podcast so that other people can learn with us which is

1502
01:56:19.50 --> 01:56:23.18
Seems fair and if anyone wants to help support the podcast

1503
01:56:23.58 --> 01:56:26.06
There's actually a bunch of different ways

1504
01:56:27.18 --> 01:56:29.18
That you can do it which will

1505
01:56:29.18 --> 01:56:33.50
Talk about it and it's not just like hey just support the podcast. That's not

1506
01:56:34.46 --> 01:56:36.46
That's not the deal no

1507
01:56:36.46 --> 01:56:41.50
It's more like just get in the game. Get in the mess. Yes. That's what it's about

1508
01:56:42.38 --> 01:56:44.38
just support the podcast

1509
01:56:44.38 --> 01:56:46.38
would be

1510
01:56:46.78 --> 01:56:48.06
Send

1511
01:56:48.06 --> 01:56:53.26
You know send money or hey we're gonna put the podcast beyond the fire wall

1512
01:56:53.66 --> 01:56:55.42
And if you want to get them you'll give them money

1513
01:56:56.22 --> 01:57:01.10
That's not what we're saying no because we're getting a lot of we're already getting a lot of the podcast

1514
01:57:01.66 --> 01:57:02.86
So we're good

1515
01:57:02.86 --> 01:57:07.50
But if you want to get deeper into the game. Let's go you can do that too

1516
01:57:08.22 --> 01:57:11.10
You can do that one way is our company

1517
01:57:12.30 --> 01:57:14.30
Origin USA

1518
01:57:15.26 --> 01:57:16.46
You can do it

1519
01:57:16.46 --> 01:57:20.86
Farming to Maine. What is it? American made products 100% American made

1520
01:57:21.66 --> 01:57:26.62
Without compromise get some we got geese and rash guards

1521
01:57:27.34 --> 01:57:29.34
Which are the best in the world?

1522
01:57:29.34 --> 01:57:34.62
Straight out no no doubt no doubt yeah

1523
01:57:35.66 --> 01:57:40.70
Factually oh it's factually the the geese are made of a blend

1524
01:57:41.34 --> 01:57:45.82
They're not a geey from 1956 which is what all other geese are

1525
01:57:47.42 --> 01:57:49.42
Just geese from 1956

1526
01:57:49.42 --> 01:57:51.42
Right

1527
01:57:51.42 --> 01:57:53.42
Not they're modern

1528
01:57:53.42 --> 01:57:57.82
Modern made for jiu jitsu yes for jiu jitsu in lead indeed

1529
01:57:57.82 --> 01:58:00.38
Yeah, yeah and also

1530
01:58:02.22 --> 01:58:06.38
The jiu jitsu I know I know but yes the jiu jitsu most comfortable jiu

1531
01:58:07.58 --> 01:58:08.78
So

1532
01:58:09.74 --> 01:58:16.46
And you know I I consider myself a fancy myself as a connoisseur of comfort right so I

1533
01:58:16.46 --> 01:58:20.94
Can serve myself a connoisseur of suffering yes, so this is the deck

1534
01:58:20.94 --> 01:58:24.78
There's a deck out of me even within the podcast with the channel. Yeah, yes, yes

1535
01:58:24.78 --> 01:58:28.78
So if you are interested in that I would recommend the jiu jitsu

1536
01:58:29.18 --> 01:58:34.62
Yeah, I'm not interested in it so if you were interested you can get them right not oh by the way

1537
01:58:34.62 --> 01:58:39.10
You can jog in them too by the way. Okay. Well, I guess that ups the suffering level a little bit

1538
01:58:39.66 --> 01:58:43.26
You can do suffering stuff in the comfortable jiu jitsu

1539
01:58:43.98 --> 01:58:45.98
That's that's kind of the key

1540
01:58:45.98 --> 01:58:47.98
What else also their supplements there?

1541
01:58:48.62 --> 01:58:51.26
You a bunch of different kinds sure

1542
01:58:51.26 --> 01:59:01.54
Yeah, joint warfare joint supplement yeah, so joint warfare is and this is totally just me doing this me

1543
01:59:01.98 --> 01:59:06.22
Cattle rising it so the krill oil I always looked at like okay, oh mega threes

1544
01:59:06.22 --> 01:59:11.42
That's for general health, you know, so joints and other stuff by the way your eyeballs

1545
01:59:12.62 --> 01:59:13.90
Other stuff too

1546
01:59:13.90 --> 01:59:19.98
It's gonna keep it more in the game healthy whatever so your joints as they degenerate over time boom

1547
01:59:19.98 --> 01:59:25.50
They'll make it three is from the krill oil which is the best absorption compared to fish oil and all these other supplements which are fine

1548
01:59:25.50 --> 01:59:31.02
But krill is way better jocosuper krill while even better more antioxidants by the way, factually

1549
01:59:31.98 --> 01:59:34.94
I always considered those as just general health I did and

1550
01:59:36.14 --> 01:59:43.34
So the joint warfare that's like if you're getting not doing jiu jitsu that's kind of the thing right even when I first started jiu jitsu

1551
01:59:43.34 --> 01:59:50.14
To a rant I think it was you like hey glucose mean and conjuritan this is gonna help you from just from all the twisting that you do

1552
01:59:50.14 --> 01:59:55.34
Stress you when you train every day is back with you know train five six days a week hardcore competing or whatever

1553
01:59:56.14 --> 02:00:01.34
And you say yeah glucose mean conjuritan so I always like viewed those two like so the joint warfare has those glucose

1554
02:00:01.34 --> 02:00:03.34
Me and curcumin

1555
02:00:03.34 --> 02:00:08.78
You know that always got to add the extra good stuff. Yeah, yeah, I did get good so it's like

1556
02:00:09.74 --> 02:00:12.22
If your joints are being like hammered on

1557
02:00:12.22 --> 02:00:14.22
Because you carry them

1558
02:00:14.46 --> 02:00:16.46
Pickaxe all day

1559
02:00:16.46 --> 02:00:19.58
Yeah, I like this anyway that's how I kind of be the thing so

1560
02:00:20.14 --> 02:00:24.06
That's where do you and my bias epinal I'm gonna go into it again. I'm gonna give you an update on it

1561
02:00:24.06 --> 02:00:29.74
So literally I'm no cast of no cast no bandage no stitch no nothing right now that's amazing in fact

1562
02:00:31.10 --> 02:00:38.14
If you see me you wouldn't even think maybe I I didn't remember that you had surgery until you

1563
02:00:38.70 --> 02:00:40.70
Told me today

1564
02:00:40.70 --> 02:00:42.70
I wanted to attend yeah, but the

1565
02:00:43.90 --> 02:00:47.58
The and that's funny say that because sometimes I even forget I had surgery

1566
02:00:47.74 --> 02:00:50.70
Yeah, like you know what I like you do just every day something on a belt

1567
02:00:51.26 --> 02:00:57.58
I'm not gonna try to drag this out but you had the exact same surgery on the other arm the healing process was much much slower

1568
02:00:57.98 --> 02:00:59.50
the only

1569
02:00:59.50 --> 02:01:05.02
I guess difference between the two scenarios there's actually two differences. I said the only but there's two differences

1570
02:01:05.66 --> 02:01:06.62
one

1571
02:01:06.62 --> 02:01:09.90
You are much younger in your first surgery

1572
02:01:09.90 --> 02:01:11.90
Which would indicate

1573
02:01:11.90 --> 02:01:18.62
That probably you would heal quicker. Yeah, but that did not happen and that has not happened in fact the opposite is happened

1574
02:01:19.26 --> 02:01:27.18
You have healed much much faster. It's not even close much faster and the only other thing is that

1575
02:01:27.74 --> 02:01:28.78
Joint warfare

1576
02:01:28.78 --> 02:01:32.46
Criollo that's the only thing I did different yes in fact

1577
02:01:33.74 --> 02:01:36.70
Yeah, I mean yeah, so only thing I did different

1578
02:01:36.70 --> 02:01:38.70
Um

1579
02:01:38.70 --> 02:01:41.50
To the point where I hear it's in the spirit of accuracy

1580
02:01:41.50 --> 02:01:47.02
I don't know technically biologically how much of this is healing as far as my tendon

1581
02:01:47.58 --> 02:01:51.10
Healing to the bone. I don't know there's no way of knowing but I do know this

1582
02:01:51.42 --> 02:01:56.70
I forget that I had surgery three weeks ago by the way to reattach my whole muscle to my bone

1583
02:01:57.90 --> 02:02:02.38
They drill a hole in your bone. They put it in that hole. They put an anchor on the other side of your bone

1584
02:02:02.38 --> 02:02:09.42
Attach something and it's bro. It's not nothing. It's definitely something and I forget that I had that surgery three weeks ago

1585
02:02:09.42 --> 02:02:10.62
By the way

1586
02:02:10.62 --> 02:02:19.82
Well, that's good joint warfare awesome Criollo oil. I've been on that forever and I highly recommend it because it helps you with everything and now you're saying it helps me with my vision too

1587
02:02:20.38 --> 02:02:27.90
Well Omega 3s helped you with a bunch of stuff in your body including my vision vision all that stuff. That's good to know. I just thought I had such sharp vision

1588
02:02:27.90 --> 02:02:39.26
Yeah, Omega 3s man looking to it's all good also discipline you need discipline. Yeah, so yeah

1589
02:02:39.26 --> 02:02:42.78
You need self discipline in your life, but you're not talking about that. I don't know

1590
02:02:43.98 --> 02:02:49.10
And it's not even in pose of discipline. Actually. It's kind of some someone imposed you're imposing on yourself

1591
02:02:49.10 --> 02:02:53.26
But not really because you made it taste okay the supplements called discipline, but you made it taste good

1592
02:02:53.26 --> 02:03:02.14
So it's not imposed it's welcomed. It's like welcome. So I was like Dave and I were up working with the company and

1593
02:03:02.94 --> 02:03:07.26
You know whatever we work whenever we get together. It's always like we're going hard and you know

1594
02:03:07.26 --> 02:03:13.98
There's not a lot of sleep going on or whatever in workouts and all that and you ever um you ever seen those

1595
02:03:14.86 --> 02:03:19.90
Like videos or memes where they got one word that means a lot of different things

1596
02:03:19.90 --> 02:03:25.42
Like I remember there was an old one about dude and it said like oh, I mean you know

1597
02:03:26.22 --> 02:03:32.14
How's it going like dude or it could mean why did you do that like dude? Right right and the other day

1598
02:03:32.14 --> 02:03:39.26
I was with Dave and we were at this gig and you know like I said we're working and he sees me with uh

1599
02:03:39.26 --> 02:03:43.74
Because you know Dave's kind of addicted to discipline. Yes, he sees me with a I took a water bottle

1600
02:03:43.74 --> 02:03:48.62
Whatever, you know normal plastic water bottle and I poured discipline because I always travel with it

1601
02:03:48.62 --> 02:03:56.38
And as I'm as I'm now standing with a clear plastic water bottle and Dave sees that I

1602
02:03:56.70 --> 02:04:00.22
That it's discipline right and he just looks at me and he goes bro

1603
02:04:02.94 --> 02:04:08.14
And I totally knew exactly what he wanted some discipline bad and I was like yeah

1604
02:04:08.14 --> 02:04:14.54
Man, I got enough for you. So I put the Dave in the knee caught on fire. Yeah on fire cognitively

1605
02:04:14.54 --> 02:04:19.26
Yes, really yes because we were well we did some physical stuff in the morning, but we didn't take this upon for that

1606
02:04:19.82 --> 02:04:23.10
It wasn't that hardcore wasn't like we were rolling but

1607
02:04:23.74 --> 02:04:27.58
Yeah, he wanted the cognitive enhancement for putting together

1608
02:04:28.38 --> 02:04:33.82
All the different applications of extreme ownership up in the company. So yeah

1609
02:04:34.38 --> 02:04:37.26
No big deal and that's what it is ultimately is a cognitive

1610
02:04:37.98 --> 02:04:42.94
Enhancing supplement but jocquistile yeah, and you know what this is the thing that I got to figure out

1611
02:04:42.94 --> 02:04:47.82
Because I've got you know I've got my own little methodologies of how I operate just across the board

1612
02:04:47.82 --> 02:04:54.22
There's just operations happening right that's just how I roll for the discipline on in when I go in in the field or

1613
02:04:54.46 --> 02:04:56.46
When I go on a trip have a little little

1614
02:04:56.46 --> 02:05:01.10
Little tougherware thing that's small and I put it up above a little elastic band on I carry in my travel bag

1615
02:05:01.10 --> 02:05:06.06
Whatever, it's okay. I haven't figured out how to do this with mulk yet which is a problem

1616
02:05:06.70 --> 02:05:08.70
Because here's the thing with mulk

1617
02:05:08.70 --> 02:05:15.34
Mulk tastes freaking good and if you don't know what mulk is it's yeah, it's got protein and it that's awesome. It's got

1618
02:05:16.70 --> 02:05:18.62
What are they bought what are they called

1619
02:05:19.26 --> 02:05:25.66
Probiotics which is awesome and I never took those before because I always thought that was kind of like just like a yoga thing

1620
02:05:26.86 --> 02:05:31.50
But they're not but they like know like talking to Brian and Pete their no

1621
02:05:31.50 --> 02:05:35.34
No, no, you definitely want to vote. So we put them in there and now that definitely your gut will feel better

1622
02:05:35.34 --> 02:05:41.66
But whatever, I don't care about any that it tastes freaking good right and so it gives you the

1623
02:05:42.22 --> 02:05:45.66
Is the ultimate like satisfaction? Yeah, you know

1624
02:05:45.90 --> 02:05:49.42
Let's see you have a giant steak which I eat a lot of giant steaks or

1625
02:05:49.90 --> 02:05:53.18
Have you read eating a giant steak and you got done and you were still like you know what

1626
02:05:57.18 --> 02:05:59.66
No, no, they can never maybe so I get that way

1627
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:06.46
What I want maybe it's all those years rice to just get after the mint chocolate chip ice cream at the end of the night and so sometimes that little

1628
02:06:07.10 --> 02:06:08.06
That little

1629
02:06:08.06 --> 02:06:09.66
For a little flashback

1630
02:06:09.66 --> 02:06:13.98
And I get done in the big steak and I'm gonna should be all happy and then said I'm like I'm not one really

1631
02:06:14.78 --> 02:06:17.98
If you have mulk with you you're good you want your dessert that's what you want

1632
02:06:17.98 --> 02:06:19.98
Yeah, I don't want to say that

1633
02:06:19.98 --> 02:06:27.10
Looks like a so anyways if you get mulk you can have dessert every night you can have dessert every day you can have breakfast mulk and dinner

1634
02:06:30.14 --> 02:06:34.54
Because it's a it's a meal and actually life was asking me life's like what does mulk mean?

1635
02:06:34.54 --> 02:06:38.86
Anyways, I was like I made it up. He's like what do you mean you made up? I made it up. How did you know?

1636
02:06:38.86 --> 02:06:40.86
What was the making up process?

1637
02:06:40.86 --> 02:06:41.82
Oh

1638
02:06:41.82 --> 02:06:44.86
Have you ever tasted it? Yes, and what did you think when you first tasted it?

1639
02:06:44.86 --> 02:06:49.90
Uh, this tastes like a dessert. It's for me. I was like oh man. This is good mulk and it just came out

1640
02:06:53.42 --> 02:06:58.14
Yeah, it's there's no other way to describe it. It wasn't milk it wasn't ice cream

1641
02:06:58.14 --> 02:07:03.18
It was something else or something new so there you go mulk. It's a mint chocolate milk shake

1642
02:07:03.18 --> 02:07:07.18
You know it's probiotics in it. Which is a big deal. You were like oh, yeah, I guess that's probably

1643
02:07:07.18 --> 02:07:13.34
products which I guess is cool. That's your whole deal. That's a huge deal. Oh, I know that now that I realize how it

1644
02:07:13.34 --> 02:07:17.90
settles your stomach but you know what I'll speak in of Dave Burke Dave

1645
02:07:18.70 --> 02:07:23.82
You know how like I'm really into mint chocolate milk. Yeah, so I do his flavor happens to be

1646
02:07:24.54 --> 02:07:30.46
peanut butter chocolate like that's his deal. So he's he's like a crack addict like

1647
02:07:30.46 --> 02:07:33.82
wins it with that wins it with a chocolate bean. Yeah, come on. So when it was coming out

1648
02:07:34.94 --> 02:07:38.94
And then and then he said it's not coming out for a long time and I was like yeah, it's gonna be like another

1649
02:07:38.94 --> 02:07:42.46
For four weeks or five weeks and he's saying I know that's a long time

1650
02:07:43.10 --> 02:07:49.18
So David easy Dave we got you yeah, I'm be honest. I agree with Dave. I feel it's an exact same way and

1651
02:07:49.42 --> 02:07:53.58
Peanut butter chocolate happens to be myself a second favorite as well. What's your first favorite?

1652
02:07:54.06 --> 02:07:58.46
Mint chocolate. Oh, see you're familiar. You're fully in the game. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no

1653
02:07:58.46 --> 02:08:01.26
100% actually they're even energy never made that connection

1654
02:08:02.46 --> 02:08:05.82
Yeah, I might have mentioned it. Maybe I did it. I don't know what to remember that

1655
02:08:05.82 --> 02:08:07.82
Yeah, so you're pumped

1656
02:08:08.06 --> 02:08:17.42
So you're all about that moment. Yes, right? Oh, you're 100% on the left. Yeah, I try not to admit too much of my my liking for desserts around you

1657
02:08:17.42 --> 02:08:23.42
I I tame that back, but the hey the facts are the facts and yeah, I'm all in

1658
02:08:23.42 --> 02:08:27.02
Actually I didn't mention this where it's like you need to do the one scoop or whatever

1659
02:08:27.02 --> 02:08:30.70
I don't do the one scoop, but I put in the in the big 30 ounce

1660
02:08:30.70 --> 02:08:38.62
Do two three scoops even I would put a little bit of a fill. I don't I feel it up. Well, you just said 30 ounce or you're talking 30 ounces

1661
02:08:38.86 --> 02:08:43.54
Yeah, I probably not to the top 20 20 23 ounces here 24 24

1662
02:08:43.54 --> 02:08:49.90
And you're putting two three scoops and three scoops in and scoops in. I'm not saying that because I'm doing like

1663
02:08:49.90 --> 02:08:55.30
Do 20 ounces of milk and two scoops. It's not extra thick. I don't think but that's just what my standard

1664
02:08:55.30 --> 02:08:59.14
I don't know like what's the stat? I don't really take protein powders or nothing like this

1665
02:08:59.14 --> 02:09:01.14
I don't want this that's all

1666
02:09:02.34 --> 02:09:05.62
Good put it actually put it egg in there putting the blender dang

1667
02:09:05.78 --> 02:09:08.06
But you really want to get nuts. I do that for like the

1668
02:09:08.62 --> 02:09:11.34
What is this for the experience? No

1669
02:09:12.18 --> 02:09:16.86
All right, so that's milk you want to go to some get some origin main dot com just

1670
02:09:17.62 --> 02:09:21.06
Origin main dot com is where you order it and you can also get it on Amazon

1671
02:09:21.62 --> 02:09:26.74
FYI if you didn't know that hey speaking of origin main dot com if you want to come to the

1672
02:09:26.74 --> 02:09:31.78
Juditsu immersion camp it is August 26 through September 2nd. There's two

1673
02:09:32.94 --> 02:09:36.34
What phases sessions or you can go to the whole thing

1674
02:09:36.98 --> 02:09:40.90
Somebody asked if we're gonna go to the origin factory if you want to come see the factory

1675
02:09:40.90 --> 02:09:46.86
Yes, we're going to the factory visit isn't in the middle of the week and we'll be doing it to all the time so get some

1676
02:09:48.10 --> 02:09:54.14
And we'll see there I'm going echo's going echo's gonna be incapacitated

1677
02:09:54.14 --> 02:09:58.70
Hmm quasi capacity oh, so you just be in a knowledge

1678
02:09:59.62 --> 02:10:06.50
acquiring mode yeah and a knowledge sharing mode here. The technically I could I could roll I could roll

1679
02:10:06.66 --> 02:10:13.18
But okay, then we roll on that question Brian Viglioni comes and starts getting nuts

1680
02:10:13.82 --> 02:10:19.82
I can't roll with him. Well, maybe good. No, I could I shouldn't it be irresponsible for me to roll hard put it that way

1681
02:10:19.82 --> 02:10:24.50
He didn't care he came here rolled and it just needed jacked up right his neat yeah

1682
02:10:24.50 --> 02:10:30.20
But it's different like a muscle tendon attachment is directly correlated injury wise

1683
02:10:30.74 --> 02:10:34.64
Directly correlated without hard you go on that muscle directly

1684
02:10:35.30 --> 02:10:41.46
So you'll be a limited basis, but you'll be there to share knowledge receive knowledge hang out kick it eat lobster

1685
02:10:41.46 --> 02:10:45.98
I will roll. Yes. Oh dang. I don't know what ever well echo's gonna be there. I'm gonna be there

1686
02:10:46.86 --> 02:10:48.86
Dave Burke is gonna be there

1687
02:10:48.86 --> 02:10:50.86
Life is gonna be there

1688
02:10:50.86 --> 02:10:57.70
JPI believe is marginal right now or not 100% but whatever will be there will be hanging out and a like

1689
02:10:58.58 --> 02:11:02.66
Black belts go lore I forgot that part black belts go lore

1690
02:11:02.78 --> 02:11:07.50
There'll be a bunch of black belts and then every other belt. Yeah, yeah, which is a huge deal

1691
02:11:07.50 --> 02:11:13.28
Knowledge wise even training one yeah, because most everyone's gonna be training. Yeah, yeah, so you get to experience like because

1692
02:11:14.28 --> 02:11:17.36
Yeah, sometimes it's like if you some people have never rolled with them

1693
02:11:17.36 --> 02:11:21.68
Yeah, some people never know some people have never trained before and they're gonna come to the camp that happened last year

1694
02:11:21.68 --> 02:11:24.48
People have never trained before came to camp, but I'm sorry. I cut you off

1695
02:11:24.48 --> 02:11:30.000
And you're gonna say that some people never rolled to the black belt before right right like even if they've been training for even like a year or something like that

1696
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.32
Some you know sometimes that's how it goes, you know

1697
02:11:33.12 --> 02:11:37.04
Or if it's like hell on a roll with juggle specifically are you you?

1698
02:11:37.04 --> 02:11:39.16

02:13:49.76 --> 02:13:55.56
Yes, sir, which which beenies for me. This is a so I sleep on my planes. Sure. You're an all-in-one plane

1725
02:13:55.56 --> 02:14:00.12
I sleep I put a beanie on my head. Well, it's least sleep for like four minutes

1726
02:14:00.12 --> 02:14:02.94
Yeah, I'm sorry you've been on the plane. Yes, sir

1727
02:14:02.94 --> 02:14:10.16
So I'll put my head up against the the bulkhead as they call it in the plane and the beanie keeps your head for a little tiny

1728
02:14:10.16 --> 02:14:15.48
Variations go on the whole time you just need that little beanie. It's like a pillow. Yeah, so I put on the beanie and sleep

1729
02:14:15.48 --> 02:14:21.80
If you see me don't bother me and then I wake up in four minutes later be ready to rock and roll on a right another buck

1730
02:14:21.80 --> 02:14:26.20
Yes, sir, see so when you say oh, I sleep on the plane. Who's think I sleep on the plane?

1731
02:14:26.20 --> 02:14:30.24
No, you sleep on the plane. That's what I'm saying. That's amazing. Yes, sir

1732
02:14:30.24 --> 02:14:36.000
I was impressed by your sleeping capabilities. Now you you you had sunglasses on yes, you were asleep for four

1733
02:14:36.24 --> 02:14:38.24
straight hours in a

1734
02:14:38.56 --> 02:14:40.56
You look like those what are those?

1735
02:14:40.56 --> 02:14:48.02
That Chinese statues in the big vault where they have like thousands of Chinese soldiers

1736
02:14:48.68 --> 02:14:50.68
All lined up

1737
02:14:50.68 --> 02:14:58.22
Yeah, anyways, they're just like a per you did not move you were out and you did not move your head stayed straight up

1738
02:14:58.22 --> 02:15:04.52
And you just sat there asleep just so this sleep in yeah, yeah, so when I say I sleep on the plane

1739
02:15:04.52 --> 02:15:05.52
I'm like

1740
02:15:05.52 --> 02:15:11.72
You know depends on what you mean by sleep, but I get it and the beanie's eliminated that makes sense

1741
02:15:11.72 --> 02:15:17.88
They allow it and they keep the headborne. Yeah, I was gonna say they do have other uses and even let's face it

1742
02:15:17.88 --> 02:15:21.36
They look kind of cool. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I know you know about that either

1743
02:15:21.96 --> 02:15:26.56
I'm about to see if you're looking cool. Then the last they are available that is true also women stuff

1744
02:15:27.84 --> 02:15:30.96
A lot of times people ask me hey make more women stuff

1745
02:15:30.96 --> 02:15:37.68
And I will but there's women stuff on their tanks and sure to whatnot the rash guards are kind of for everybody as well

1746
02:15:37.68 --> 02:15:40.08
But yeah good stuff on their good women stuff

1747
02:15:40.92 --> 02:15:46.96
Good stuff to get after it in and hoodies. Yes. Don't forget about hoodies. Yeah, I'm gonna make a new hoodie

1748
02:15:46.96 --> 02:15:51.68
You might not approve of this. I think why are we making things that I don't approve of?

1749
02:15:51.68 --> 02:15:57.44
I would you know sometimes they look I don't break the rules ever. Why won't I approve it except something?

1750
02:15:57.44 --> 02:16:01.56
Um, because it's lightweight. It's a lighter weight hoodie. Can we?

1751
02:16:02.20 --> 02:16:08.72
Did it might be a zip-up as the Hawaiian version? Wait, why would someone want a hoodie that's not gonna keep more?

1752
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:13.40
It'll keep you a little bit warm because sometimes because you're going to you can't you know when you're sleeping

1753
02:16:13.40 --> 02:16:15.12
Or when you're trying to go sleep at night, right?

1754
02:16:15.12 --> 02:16:19.12
And then you put the covers on your like tank. I'm too hot. You take the covers off. Oh, it's like too cold

1755
02:16:19.12 --> 02:16:23.52
So you gotta get in that little zone that you can't get into sometimes everyone's in a while. It's like that

1756
02:16:23.68 --> 02:16:26.64
So sometimes in life. It's like that. Okay

1757
02:16:26.64 --> 02:16:32.000
Guaward in this can we make ultra. I want the heaviest possible weight that they make in the in America

1758
02:16:32.32 --> 02:16:39.44
This is what we need to get with Pete. No, and we're gonna straight up your doubt fabricate even whatever even

1759
02:16:40.16 --> 02:16:45.84
Yeah, even when you talk to Pete like let me get the samples. I want him in my hands

1760
02:16:45.84 --> 02:16:47.44
I want to feel the weight

1761
02:16:47.44 --> 02:16:49.44
Not playing around with this Hawaiian

1762
02:16:49.44 --> 02:16:54.32
Love Hawaii as you know it's my whole land, but I'm not down with the Hawaiian sweatshirts. Hey, so

1763
02:16:54.32 --> 02:16:56.32

02:17:37.76 --> 02:17:40.72

1826
02:21:09.84 --> 02:21:14.48
I have a 20 pound mace that I've been hoarding at my house and I apologize, but I owe it to you

1827
02:21:14.48 --> 02:21:15.28
I'll bring it next time

1828
02:21:15.28 --> 02:21:18.80
So cute because they're they're you know what I use those four people. So what do you do with those?

1829
02:21:18.80 --> 02:21:25.60
Basically I swung them around like a maniac psycho barbarian with a battle axe. Yeah, but they're a little shorter

1830
02:21:26.48 --> 02:21:30.32
But they're heavy and I put it into my I'll put it into my

1831
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:35.92
Routine let's say routine because that's every day. I put it into a workout

1832
02:21:36.56 --> 02:21:46.80
Almost as like a little mobility slash cardio slash something break it's it's a good tool to have it's a good tool to have

1833
02:21:46.80 --> 02:21:52.08
I got you you think the 20 pounder the 20 pounder looks light when I give it to you can be like oh

1834
02:21:52.08 --> 02:21:59.04
I'm gonna you know it's it's heavy will consider aside from a 20 pound weight like what weighs 20 pounds nothing

1835
02:21:59.04 --> 02:22:03.44
You huge things TV or something like this like you yeah, and then you see a mace

1836
02:22:03.44 --> 02:22:08.32
I have a how long it's not gonna as long as you show it's probably might might not even be too

1837
02:22:08.32 --> 02:22:14.16
Feet long yeah, it's 20 pounds one tea pounds. Yeah, so you're your eyes and you're brain and your body kind of like

1838
02:22:14.16 --> 02:22:19.28
There's kind of miscalculating you know by observation you pick it up. You're like dang this thing is heavy

1839
02:22:19.28 --> 02:22:24.56
Yeah, yeah, so do it. Yeah, actually that's perfect. I go walk down this canyon right outside my house

1840
02:22:24.56 --> 02:22:27.92
This is canyon and I always feel like I want to carry something

1841
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:34.96
This thing actually if you had it as a weapon it would not be effective. It's too heavy. Yeah, it's like that

1842
02:22:34.96 --> 02:22:39.28
That's how heavy it is it'd be cool to carry and I'm sure if you had a blood into someone to death with it

1843
02:22:39.28 --> 02:22:41.04
You could serve if you'd mind it

1844
02:22:41.04 --> 02:22:46.96
But it would be not an ideal weapon to get some outmine which is like the big threat here when you're working in the canyon behind your house

1845
02:22:46.96 --> 02:22:49.84
You know you get the mountain lion you're gonna rear that

1846
02:22:50.56 --> 02:22:52.96
Mesa that they got to buy the neck

1847
02:22:54.16 --> 02:23:00.16
Actually it's more just to get usually all grab like a thin stick just it's just to kind of have and yeah, it's just fun, you know

1848
02:23:00.16 --> 02:23:06.24
Yeah, but I'll be saw it. Yeah, I'm looking for it to go on but hey that elk

Articins but the can I pound weem more of the can then the didn't because I don't like brew it

1871
02:25:21.36 --> 02:25:28.56
Yeah, but they can't all I'm popping them every day surprisingly too because I don't you know how you how there's tea drinkers

1872
02:25:29.12 --> 02:25:33.68
Technically whatever I'm not a tea drinker. This is what I think is gonna be interesting

1873
02:25:34.96 --> 02:25:40.96
It tastes really good. Yes. It makes you feel really good. It's a refreshing

1874
02:25:41.44 --> 02:25:48.96
Right? It's just got that thing that just like is good. Right. Okay. I think I think

1875
02:25:48.96 --> 02:25:54.40
Get one of the standard energy drinks. They're filled with sugar

1876
02:25:54.96 --> 02:26:01.76
They should and they they got everything in there to make them taste good. That's what they're set up for and they got the caffeine

1877
02:26:01.76 --> 02:26:03.76
That's gonna make you feel good and all this stuff

1878
02:26:04.72 --> 02:26:06.72
as good as those things are

1879
02:26:09.04 --> 02:26:14.56
The the darkway tea is it's better it's it's it's like if you had the choice of one of the two like let's okay

1880
02:26:14.56 --> 02:26:21.36
Let's be real. I'm gonna be real here with you right now for a second sure if I had the choice between like a salad and

1881
02:26:21.76 --> 02:26:24.16
A mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake

1882
02:26:25.20 --> 02:26:27.76
If I had to spill my heart

1883
02:26:27.92 --> 02:26:31.84
Spill your right now. I'd be like if you put those two in front of me

1884
02:26:32.96 --> 02:26:34.48
Nine times out of ten

1885
02:26:34.48 --> 02:26:39.44
I'm gonna get the mint chocolate chip milkshake occasionally. I'll be like okay. I'll have the salad because I'm really in the mood for that

1886
02:26:39.60 --> 02:26:42.88
But nine times out of the ten like I'm just gonna go with what you know

1887
02:26:42.88 --> 02:26:45.68
Which is that mint chocolate chip milkshake is good?

1888
02:26:47.04 --> 02:26:49.04
With this nine times out of the ten

1889
02:26:49.28 --> 02:26:54.64
You're actually gonna get chocolate tea. You're not gonna take the thing you're not gonna get the thing that's been engineered to be like

1890
02:26:55.36 --> 02:27:00.56
Attack your taste buds and make them massage and feel good. Yeah, and you know and you know

1891
02:27:00.56 --> 02:27:05.20
I think it's just obviously an assumption but when you get like okay you have a chocolate tea in a can

1892
02:27:05.44 --> 02:27:09.36
Then you have a standard energy drink the standard energy drink

1893
02:27:09.36 --> 02:27:14.32
I think the taste is more of a secondary thing when they make it. It's more like you know

1894
02:27:14.32 --> 02:27:19.36
Get you and like the caffeine and then the whatever but they make that stuff taste good. They try to yes

1895
02:27:19.36 --> 02:27:24.72
But that's secondary. That's why like it brought taste to energy drink. It's like okay, you know all the taste

1896
02:27:24.72 --> 02:27:30.24
I'll get taste good but it's like it can be in a quiet taste kind of weird to be honest with you

1897
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:35.20
And that's a good point with this. It's like how you say I don't want to overuse the word refreshing

1898
02:27:35.20 --> 02:27:39.60
Don't want to do that. What what I was just gonna say is in order to not overuse that word

1899
02:27:40.16 --> 02:27:44.96
Have you ever okay? Remember when you were kid and you were doing something you're all hot

1900
02:27:44.96 --> 02:27:50.48
Sweaty tired like it's hot outside and you're thirsty and so you're you get a gatorade

1901
02:27:51.04 --> 02:27:56.40
And you drink the gatorade and when you get down to gatorade you're still thirsty because it's got whatever

1902
02:27:56.40 --> 02:28:00.40
It hasn't it that doesn't taste like water. It's like too far away from water

1903
02:28:00.40 --> 02:28:08.16
When you when you drink the tea it's like an actual it actually satisfies the actual first

1904
02:28:08.16 --> 02:28:14.64
Yes, it does yeah, because it's sweet. It's super mild. It is mild but it does have a weird kind of

1905
02:28:15.28 --> 02:28:21.36
I mean I don't want to overstate this but it's like this crispy kind of feeling it could be the can

1906
02:28:21.36 --> 02:28:25.04
It could be the can I don't know you know you drink the life of a guy man

1907
02:28:25.04 --> 02:28:31.36
I get the same thing so how's this so two occasions is legitimate and recent that's why so two occasion one time

1908
02:28:31.36 --> 02:28:36.000
My husband can sick oh sick or straight up sick and

1909
02:28:37.04 --> 02:28:41.76
I was feeling like oh you know I took I was sick to the point where I got to take like one of these you know

1910
02:28:41.76 --> 02:28:46.32
I don't know night quick night. Well, it's like Tylenol you know the liquid one the little the red

1911
02:28:47.60 --> 02:28:52.000
And I've perhaps been so long since I took anything like that so I was like I don't know how much you take

1912
02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.08
Let me so I put it in a little shot glass that I had and I just pound it apparently it was too much

1913
02:28:56.08 --> 02:29:01.84
So I'm like oh my jammed up super jammed up like super nauseous head on messed up like oh

1914
02:29:01.84 --> 02:29:05.28
Couldn't like think that could that was messed up and we had to record that day

1915
02:29:05.44 --> 02:29:08.24
So this was earlier like in the morning and then so I'm like shoot

1916
02:29:08.24 --> 02:29:13.28
I'm hoping off this thing. I just kind of laid out on whatever and I probably wasn't off it when I came in and recorded

1917
02:29:13.28 --> 02:29:15.92
I was like man, I'm like super nauseous. I'm not feeling good

1918
02:29:15.92 --> 02:29:20.56
So I tried to drink like some a caffeine thing to kind of probably didn't help you. It was messing me up

1919
02:29:20.56 --> 02:29:27.28
So I grabbed one of these and instantly no not the kind like I drank some and then I ended up feeling better

1920
02:29:27.28 --> 02:29:28.88
It was like I drank it else a day

1921
02:29:29.92 --> 02:29:35.52
Instantly felt better so I was like you know could have been a timing thing whatever and no 100% full credit goes

1922
02:29:35.52 --> 02:29:38.48
Yeah, 100% but the thing is that's what I'm saying

1923
02:29:38.48 --> 02:29:40.48
I'm definitely bruised

1924
02:29:40.80 --> 02:29:44.64
Total addict though I realized but and then another time I drank I

1925
02:29:45.28 --> 02:29:47.04
Okay, so I'm

1926
02:29:47.04 --> 02:29:53.36
Like you like I do like coffee, you know for the for the the caffeine right in the morning whenever so that come across this coffee the

1927
02:29:53.36 --> 02:29:59.84
Brand will remain nameless, but it's 1.75 times almost two times the caffeine 200% it's

1928
02:30:00.16 --> 02:30:02.88
175% cash of the caffeine. That's a lot of caffeine

1929
02:30:03.44 --> 02:30:06.88
So I'm like hey, I'm gonna get this and you know if it's like too crazy

1930
02:30:06.88 --> 02:30:12.08
I'll just make less of it or drink less water down whatever so I make some first time it totally messes you up

1931
02:30:12.08 --> 02:30:15.92
Yeah, it puts you caffeine is like a curve where you want to hit it at the top of the wave

1932
02:30:15.92 --> 02:30:20.88
You know where it catches you if you drink too much it makes you feel jittery and then if you're really drink too much it

1933
02:30:20.88 --> 02:30:26.64
Makes you feel kind of sick in my experience this just regular the same amount of drink of regular coffee

1934
02:30:26.64 --> 02:30:31.84
It put me over into nausea immediately no like maybe the seed of belly dude

1935
02:30:32.32 --> 02:30:36.72
No, it wasn't like pain like how something it'll it's like it's in your head

1936
02:30:36.72 --> 02:30:39.36
You know it makes your head all weekly at whatever and

1937
02:30:40.24 --> 02:30:44.40
Something bad to mess up for this thing so the next day I'm like I'm not gonna drink that I was like no, you know what?

1938
02:30:44.40 --> 02:30:47.92
Oh water it down so water down boom same exact thing mess me up

1939
02:30:49.04 --> 02:30:51.76
And happen to be yet another day that we record

1940
02:30:52.32 --> 02:30:57.68
So I come in I'm like okay and I grab another one of these seeds again instantly like immediately

1941
02:30:57.92 --> 02:31:02.80
It didn't like oh help it where off later or whatever immediately made me feel better no nausea

1942
02:31:03.28 --> 02:31:06.000
I'm not saying this is an anti-najim medication

1943
02:31:06.32 --> 02:31:11.52
But I will tell you this you're just providing multiple examples of care at all diseases

1944
02:31:11.52 --> 02:31:17.36
Yeah, I will say that about the chocolate tea in a can or can by the way

1945
02:31:17.76 --> 02:31:21.92
Certified yes, sir, all right cool got some books

1946
02:31:23.76 --> 02:31:27.04
That I've written and you can get those on

1947
02:31:27.60 --> 02:31:34.64
Boy can you get them for books are sold. Yeah, that's what is not the best one the current one that I'm on right now

1948
02:31:35.20 --> 02:31:39.76
Me and my daughter will work it to Mark's mission actually she was very

1949
02:31:39.76 --> 02:31:46.24
Very very excited about that I think because you signed it too, but oh yeah, but yeah, that's a good one

1950
02:31:46.96 --> 02:31:49.68
And she happened to be you know in the beginning the paper mache

1951
02:31:50.24 --> 02:31:56.32
Yeah, Bob can yeah, she was really into that by the way, but she has a situation where one of the girls in her

1952
02:31:56.72 --> 02:31:58.72
classes like

1953
02:31:58.72 --> 02:32:02.64
She's not a teaser necessarily, but she's just bossy. You know you got to ditch just

1954
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:10.80
I deal with people I get a lot of warrior kid podcast questions about bossy kids. Yeah, and it yeah, and it makes sense

1955
02:32:10.80 --> 02:32:17.12
But she yeah, she's she's all on that yeah, and so that's another thing worth mentioning

1956
02:32:17.36 --> 02:32:19.36
Is there's the warrior kid books

1957
02:32:19.76 --> 02:32:24.08
Two of them way the warrior kid and Mark's mission and there's also warrior kid

1958
02:32:25.04 --> 02:32:29.76
Podcasts called warrior kid podcast and ask uncle Jake

1959
02:32:29.76 --> 02:32:34.08
So you can check that one out. There's also the discipline equals freedom field manual

1960
02:32:34.64 --> 02:32:36.64
Which tells you how to get after it

1961
02:32:37.84 --> 02:32:40.24
Very clearly and if you want to

1962
02:32:41.12 --> 02:32:49.04
Get it on audio the only way you can get it on the audio is as an MP3 album or you can buy individual tracks if you want them

1963
02:32:50.32 --> 02:32:52.96
iTunes Amazon music Google play et cetera

1964
02:32:53.60 --> 02:32:55.84
Yeah, also extreme ownership this

1965
02:32:56.88 --> 02:32:57.92
The

1966
02:32:57.92 --> 02:32:59.92
Red deans all the original right?

1967
02:32:59.92 --> 02:33:02.96
Immunisher no, this is the second version now. Yeah

1968
02:33:03.60 --> 02:33:10.08
It's like any enhanced version. Yeah, there's clips there's sections from the pop from this podcast in the new extreme ownership

1969
02:33:10.08 --> 02:33:13.52
Yeah, that's the when they come out when they really release a book

1970
02:33:14.24 --> 02:33:19.76
They want to add a little spice to it. Yeah, makes it so the spice is the podcast actually. Yeah, it's pretty cool

1971
02:33:19.92 --> 02:33:26.48
So extreme ownership book sprinkled with podcast. Yes, spice spicy podcast. Yes, yeah

1972
02:33:26.48 --> 02:33:31.76
Um, good one simple but not easy now one but if you can assimilate it legitimately

1973
02:33:32.32 --> 02:33:38.32
Life changing what's cool to me. Yeah, you know you just threw out life changing yes

1974
02:33:38.48 --> 02:33:41.60
Throughout there. No, I'm not the only one. No, that's what I'm saying

1975
02:33:41.60 --> 02:33:49.60
What's cool? What's cool is when people are pretty stoked about the impact that it's had on their personal life and on their business and on their family

1976
02:33:49.84 --> 02:33:54.16
And I hear people talking about that and they they come and talk to me about it and send me emails and everything else

1977
02:33:54.16 --> 02:33:58.56
It's awesome. So that's the book extreme ownership wrote it with my brother, Dave Babin and

1978
02:34:00.48 --> 02:34:02.24
Life and I just wrote another book

1979
02:34:02.24 --> 02:34:06.40
I kind of reference it a couple times today. It's called the dichotomy of leadership and

1980
02:34:07.36 --> 02:34:13.28
Life and I literally I keep saying we just get done writing it if you heard me say that on this podcast before

1981
02:34:13.28 --> 02:34:17.68
Yes, well, I have you know why because every time you edit you gotta edit it

1982
02:34:17.68 --> 02:34:23.28
So every time you think you're done you're not done and so we just turned in another series of edits and the edits are

1983
02:34:23.28 --> 02:34:31.36
It's not like we're going through these massive changes, but you just you just somebody changes something in a sentence and then it throws off this other thing and so just paint

1984
02:34:32.48 --> 02:34:34.48
the way

1985
02:34:34.48 --> 02:34:42.40
That's what that's what we're doing. Do you have the philosophy like mother? I forget who said it, but it's like editing is done when you can take away

1986
02:34:42.40 --> 02:34:48.16
No more yes, and then there's the other one. No, it's the opposite. Yes editing is done when you can't you can't

1987
02:34:48.16 --> 02:34:52.64
Every word matters and you know, you know, life and I live

1988
02:34:53.36 --> 02:34:57.84
Lave basically like I do like a thousand words a day and I edit the same way well

1989
02:34:57.84 --> 02:35:01.36
I edit you can edit faster, so I'll edit like one chapter at a time

1990
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.24
But but then I'll do that one per day

1991
02:35:04.40 --> 02:35:07.84
Laves the opposite he just goes boom. He just goes and

1992
02:35:08.48 --> 02:35:10.24
Who called me at like midnight brought

1993
02:35:11.60 --> 02:35:13.60
For a little hard

1994
02:35:13.60 --> 02:35:20.08
Frate you down. I'm like that's awesome man, but yes, and then we edit each other and

1995
02:35:21.68 --> 02:35:25.84
So we're it takes a while so we just finished another series of edits and

1996
02:35:26.80 --> 02:35:30.48
Both of us are so life sent me a text the other days. I broke this book this book is awesome

1997
02:35:30.48 --> 02:35:34.08
It is actually oh, that's right because you have a little little taste of it

1998
02:35:34.08 --> 02:35:38.80
That's yeah, yeah, so it is I think it's really gonna help people out and again

1999
02:35:38.80 --> 02:35:42.72
You can preorder that thing right now so that the publisher prints enough so that people can actually have them

2000
02:35:42.72 --> 02:35:47.52
Because the publishers don't ever get it and it does man it does help and I'm really I don't want to

2001
02:35:47.52 --> 02:35:52.24
I want to give it away any kind of spoil or nothing like that, but it does it makes like complete sense

2002
02:35:52.24 --> 02:35:55.44
Especially after extreme ownership where you know, so extreme

2003
02:35:56.24 --> 02:36:01.76
Ownership like and it kind of has this tone of extremeness which is it's all true and accurate

2004
02:36:01.76 --> 02:36:06.80
But I can see how like someone might not get that little element of like hey

2005
02:36:06.80 --> 02:36:12.32
It's extreme but it's more of like this approach to like this whole thing and that whole thing is this balance

2006
02:36:12.32 --> 02:36:18.24
Yes, you know like that economy of you yeah, I actually wrote in the book dichotomy leadership one of the

2007
02:36:19.36 --> 02:36:23.60
One of the problems with extreme ownership is the title extreme ownership because people think it got to be extreme

2008
02:36:23.84 --> 02:36:27.44
No, actually you need to you need to not be extreme most of the time as a leader

2009
02:36:27.44 --> 02:36:31.04
You need to be balanced now. Do you need to be extreme and you're attitude towards ownership?

2010
02:36:31.04 --> 02:36:36.24
Yes, you absolutely do but you need to be extreme and you're attitude of being aggressive

2011
02:36:36.48 --> 02:36:38.32
No because if you get too aggressive

2012
02:36:38.32 --> 02:36:40.80
You're gonna cause other problems

2013
02:36:40.80 --> 02:36:46.72
Yeah, yeah like extreme meaning like don't deviate from thinking like this kind of thing not like

2014
02:36:47.36 --> 02:36:50.72
When I go in I'm just owning everything no exceptions

2015
02:36:50.72 --> 02:36:56.96
What you say doesn't matter. This is my kind of kind of extreme. It's not that and then really the extremeness of the balance

2016
02:36:56.96 --> 02:37:02.80
It's almost like a contradictory thing, but it's all the parts that like I'm using it for a little something that

2017
02:37:02.80 --> 02:37:07.92
I have to do it, but you know anyway, I'm reading some of it

2018
02:37:07.92 --> 02:37:14.48

02:37:18.96 --> 02:37:22.32
Really help people out. Okay, so that'll be good

2021
02:37:23.52 --> 02:37:26.32

2030
02:38:10.96 --> 02:38:13.36
Yeah, yeah your brain boom. Yeah, it's good

2031
02:38:14.80 --> 02:38:22.96
Also the mustard that's a big part look I'm essentially an ent attendie at the mustard with a camera with a camera

2032
02:38:22.96 --> 02:38:29.68
Which is even more so yeah because I get to rewatch it certain parts. Oh, yeah, you'll get to get up like move around get close

2033
02:38:29.68 --> 02:38:34.88
Yeah, outstanding time by the way and so yeah, there's a net there's another one

2034
02:38:35.68 --> 02:38:44.08
The the one the last one went to sold out once for that one sold out DC was pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean, and it was a beast what let me DC was awesome

2035
02:38:45.44 --> 02:38:49.68
It was just awesome being in DC and the mustard was a good time and

2036
02:38:50.48 --> 02:38:57.12
People learned a ton so yeah sold out again. Yeah all of them sold out yeah and

2037
02:38:57.12 --> 02:39:05.12
So it's reasonable as you always say to believe that this next one is gonna sell out

2038
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.28
Oh the next one's gonna sell out. Yeah, yeah, they're definitely gonna sell out. It's a

2039
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:16.88
San Francisco mustard 0 0 6 October 17th and 18th it's absolutely gonna sell out so if you want to come

2040
02:39:17.60 --> 02:39:23.28
Register the other thing that happens is you book hotel rooms, you know because those things get bought bought up too

2041
02:39:23.68 --> 02:39:25.04
so

2042
02:39:25.04 --> 02:39:27.60
Yeah, it's it's a leadership seminar

2043
02:39:27.76 --> 02:39:32.48
We talk about leadership and it's not just talking about leadership. We actually give you the pragmatic tools

2044
02:39:32.48 --> 02:39:34.88
That you need to take home and become a better leader

2045
02:39:35.20 --> 02:39:40.32
business in your life. I was watching this I was watching TV the other day

2046
02:39:41.60 --> 02:39:48.16
Because my kids were watching TV wasn't my choice by the way by the last I'm watching TV and I see a little

2047
02:39:48.16 --> 02:39:54.32
You know the commercial it's almost it's a local like come or you know how the commercial like like one commercial kind of starts then it goes to the local

2048
02:39:54.32 --> 02:39:59.20
Commercial you know that situation you know that happens so anyway it's for this seminar

2049
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:05.44
You know for I don't I forget maybe real estate or whatever you know cool cool info whatever and you know

2050
02:40:05.44 --> 02:40:11.36
How in the video they show you know like clips from the actual seminar that they held last time or something like a pro

2051
02:40:11.92 --> 02:40:17.20
I'm gonna end then you can't help but compare it to like the mustard situation and it's like man night and day

2052
02:40:17.20 --> 02:40:21.84
You know, I'm the one this cool looks like people getting good information but Pro. It's just way different

2053
02:40:21.84 --> 02:40:28.64
Yeah, this is no it's um that's why that's why they're all selling out. Yeah, that's why people are people coming back

2054
02:40:28.64 --> 02:40:32.88
So there's that added element where they kind of get to hang with you guys. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right

2055
02:40:32.88 --> 02:40:37.04
There's no green room. There's gonna be a kind of such actually the last one there was literally no backstage

2056
02:40:37.52 --> 02:40:41.04
Like there was no place you we were just out front without front the whole time

2057
02:40:41.36 --> 02:40:47.20
The whole team not that you would even need it because you kind of you don't go back there. No, can't kind of can't no green room

2058
02:40:47.20 --> 02:40:51.54
Even when you say there's a break there's already a line. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kind of formula okay because you'll mean you get questions

2059
02:40:51.54 --> 02:40:56.54
Everyone ask questions in between and sign books and hang out and take pictures and all that stuff. That's what we do

2060
02:40:56.54 --> 02:40:57.68
the whole time yeah

laziness is the shame of us all laziness

2088

makes us prefer the easy path

2089
02:42:50.12 --> 02:42:53.16
the weak path

2090
02:42:53.16 --> 02:42:57.16
instead of glory

2091
02:42:57.16 --> 02:43:02.44
do not allow that instead take the hard path

2092
02:43:02.44 --> 02:43:06.20
take the discipline path take the war path

2093
02:43:06.20 --> 02:43:08.36
the path

2094
02:43:08.36 --> 02:43:10.68
of getting after it

2095
02:43:10.68 --> 02:43:13.16
