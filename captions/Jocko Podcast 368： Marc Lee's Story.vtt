00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.40
This is Jocko podcast number 368 with echo Charles than me. Jocko willing. Good evening echo. Good evening

2
00:00:08.52 --> 00:00:10.52
It was another day

3
00:00:11.48 --> 00:00:18.12
We had been here just over three months and it was already a

4
00:00:19.40 --> 00:00:21.40
historical deployment

5
00:00:22.34 --> 00:00:25.52
The task unit was well known by everyone in Ramadi

6
00:00:25.52 --> 00:00:31.80
We had pushed the envelope and taken huge risks to aggressively destroy the enemy

7
00:00:32.44 --> 00:00:34.44
Who was ruthless and evil?

8
00:00:35.88 --> 00:00:41.02
They killed innocent men women and children beheaded local tribal leaders and

9
00:00:41.96 --> 00:00:46.08
Implanted roadside bombs that killed and maimed American soldiers and Marines

10
00:00:48.64 --> 00:00:53.92
We had already killed well over a hundred of these demonic enemy fighters and in doing so

11
00:00:53.92 --> 00:00:56.96
Saved hundreds of American soldiers and Marines

12
00:00:59.52 --> 00:01:01.52
But it was a tough fight

13
00:01:02.40 --> 00:01:06.44
Brave warriors courageous soldiers and Marines died every day

14
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:09.08
from enemy sniper attacks

15
00:01:09.08 --> 00:01:15.08
IEDs and every other weapon you could imagine including mortars RPGs and heavy machine guns

16
00:01:17.48 --> 00:01:22.50
Valiantly these brave soldiers and Marines fought on day after day

17
00:01:22.50 --> 00:01:24.50
week after week

18
00:01:25.46 --> 00:01:27.46
Month after bloody month

19
00:01:30.50 --> 00:01:32.50
We had also suffered some casualties

20
00:01:33.50 --> 00:01:40.22
The most serious of which was Kaui who had been shot in the leg severely wounding it during one of our first operations

21
00:01:42.78 --> 00:01:48.74
Even as he lay in bed his leg torn apart from hip to knee not knowing if he would ever walk again

22
00:01:48.74 --> 00:01:56.42
He pulled me in close and whispered to me so the doctors wouldn't hear please. Let me stay please

23
00:01:59.82 --> 00:02:01.82
He wanted to be with his brothers

24
00:02:04.18 --> 00:02:06.58
Our other casualties were relatively minor

25
00:02:08.30 --> 00:02:10.30
We were blessed

26
00:02:11.46 --> 00:02:16.46
Especially when compared to some of the other units that we were there with who had lost dozens of men

27
00:02:16.46 --> 00:02:24.06
One army battalion had arrived and lost seven men during their first 36 hours worth of patrols

28
00:02:25.66 --> 00:02:31.10
Another army company had lost a third of its strength in five months of fighting

29
00:02:32.78 --> 00:02:36.14
We had been lucky blessed and lucky

30
00:02:39.10 --> 00:02:41.50
Aggressiveness on the battlefield certainly helped our luck

31
00:02:41.50 --> 00:02:45.78
We fought hard and brought destruction to the enemy

32
00:02:46.66 --> 00:02:50.42
We forcefully pushed into areas where the enemy was in control

33
00:02:50.58 --> 00:02:55.86
We went in where a quick reaction force might not have been able to help get us

34
00:02:57.22 --> 00:02:59.22
The enemy was not ready for this

35
00:03:00.50 --> 00:03:03.30
They had not been attacked so boldly and mercilessly

36
00:03:04.78 --> 00:03:09.22
We snuck in at night off of boats or in the day with conventional forces

37
00:03:09.22 --> 00:03:14.86
We hid in buildings next to their strongholds. We killed them as they slinked towards our positions

38
00:03:14.86 --> 00:03:21.70
We surrounded their neighborhoods without them knowing and killed them as they prepared attacks on American troops

39
00:03:24.98 --> 00:03:32.50
The American commanders knew this and love the seals because we were helping to keep their brave men alive

40
00:03:32.50 --> 00:03:40.70
Our aggressive tactics and high number of enemy kills earned us an incredible reputation

41
00:03:42.66 --> 00:03:49.34
The soldiers and Marines thought we were unbelievable on the battlefield efficient killers that had barely taken any casualties

42
00:03:49.34 --> 00:04:01.38
We were indestructible killing machines there to save our fellow Americans and destroy the enemies of our nation

43
00:04:01.38 --> 00:04:03.38
That was their impression

44
00:04:05.38 --> 00:04:07.38
But there was fear

45
00:04:08.38 --> 00:04:12.38
Self-preservation is a natural instinct and is very powerful

46
00:04:12.38 --> 00:04:18.98
Fear is one of the most important tools for self-preservation and it exists on some level at every man

47
00:04:22.38 --> 00:04:28.38
But this fear was overcome by courage, camaraderie and faith

48
00:04:31.38 --> 00:04:35.38
Mark was one of the greatest examples of these qualities

49
00:04:37.38 --> 00:04:40.38
He showed his courage consistently by leading from the front

50
00:04:40.38 --> 00:04:44.38
Always in the front of patrols ready to fight and defend his brothers

51
00:04:45.38 --> 00:04:50.38
His camaraderie was always evident as he joked with everyone smiling and laughing

52
00:04:50.38 --> 00:04:55.38
Even as he was about to walk onto the battlefield and even on the battlefield itself

53
00:04:58.38 --> 00:05:00.38
He was truly loved by all

54
00:05:02.38 --> 00:05:05.38
Finally the depth of his faith was immeasurable

55
00:05:05.38 --> 00:05:11.38
He had an unbelievably strong relationship with God and this was reflected in his love for his family

56
00:05:11.38 --> 00:05:13.38
who were always with him

57
00:05:14.38 --> 00:05:16.38
In his heart and on his mind

58
00:05:19.38 --> 00:05:23.38
Mark's qualities helped soothe the fears of everyone around him

59
00:05:23.38 --> 00:05:27.38
His spirit was contagious and it spread and comforted all of us

60
00:05:30.38 --> 00:05:32.38
He was a pillar of courage

61
00:05:32.38 --> 00:05:34.38
And so fear was defeated

62
00:05:35.38 --> 00:05:42.38
And mission after mission would result in the deaths of dozens of insurgents and continued success for the seals

63
00:05:42.38 --> 00:05:50.38
as we, alongside our conventional forced brothers, fought to win back the city from the wretched, murderous insurgents

64
00:05:53.38 --> 00:05:55.38
But the fighting was hard

65
00:05:55.38 --> 00:06:00.38
I was in the Tactical Operations Center the morning of August 2nd 2006

66
00:06:03.38 --> 00:06:08.38
Ryan had been wounded and was already being flown to Belod for further medical attention

67
00:06:11.38 --> 00:06:16.38
We did not know at this time how severe his wounds would be, but we were thankful he was still alive

68
00:06:16.38 --> 00:06:23.38
The city had erupted in violence and the Army unit we had fought alongside for the last few months

69
00:06:23.38 --> 00:06:25.38
was in the midst of a very tough battle

70
00:06:25.38 --> 00:06:28.38
They believed they had identified where some insurgents were located

71
00:06:31.38 --> 00:06:34.38
Lath called me and gave me an update on the situation

72
00:06:34.38 --> 00:06:38.38
He told me their Iraqi Army partners had been involved in the war

73
00:06:38.38 --> 00:06:41.38
and they were in the middle of a very tough battle

74
00:06:41.38 --> 00:06:47.38
They called me and gave me an update on the situation, he told me their Iraqi Army partners were too scared to fight

75
00:06:51.38 --> 00:06:53.38
Then Lath said, we're going back out

76
00:06:55.38 --> 00:07:00.38
I knew that this was a bold statement and that violent contact with the enemy was imminent

77
00:07:02.38 --> 00:07:05.38
I replied simply, Roger, get some

78
00:07:05.38 --> 00:07:08.38
This reply was not senseless bravado

79
00:07:08.38 --> 00:07:11.38
It was a statement of fact, encouragement and trust

80
00:07:11.38 --> 00:07:18.38
Fact, because there was a vicious firefight and as proud fighting men wrought with a strong sense of duty

81
00:07:18.38 --> 00:07:23.38
they all knew it was their duty to join the fight, no matter how dire the situation

82
00:07:24.38 --> 00:07:31.38
Encouragement, because we regularly use this term to motivate ourselves and each other during trying times

83
00:07:31.38 --> 00:07:35.38
and finally trust because I did not have to question what Lath and his platoon were doing

84
00:07:36.38 --> 00:07:41.38
I didn't need to counsel him on their plan or inquire about his tactical decisions

85
00:07:41.38 --> 00:07:44.38
No, they had proven themselves to be a great combat unit

86
00:07:44.38 --> 00:07:49.38
and I trusted them to perform with honor and professionalism on the battlefield

87
00:07:53.38 --> 00:07:58.38
I now focused my attention on the flat screen televisions in the Tactical Operations Center

88
00:07:58.38 --> 00:08:02.38
A live video feed was coming in from aircraft monitoring the battle

89
00:08:03.38 --> 00:08:06.38
The picture was fading in and out and was difficult to see

90
00:08:06.38 --> 00:08:11.38
but I followed as tanks fired at buildings and cars and soldiers maneuvered in the streets

91
00:08:13.38 --> 00:08:18.38
I watched the two Bradley fighting vehicles left combat outpost Falcon

92
00:08:21.38 --> 00:08:23.38
I knew they were filled with seals

93
00:08:23.38 --> 00:08:29.38
I watched as the Bradleys stopped at one building, engaged it and then stood by while the seals assaulted

94
00:08:32.38 --> 00:08:35.38
The seals were on small radio so I couldn't hear them

95
00:08:35.38 --> 00:08:39.38
and said I listened on the radio as the conventional company commander Captain Mike Baima

96
00:08:39.38 --> 00:08:42.38
passed information about the situation to his battalion commander

97
00:08:42.38 --> 00:08:45.38
My brother's seals looked unbelievably good

98
00:08:45.38 --> 00:08:48.38
I was able to see the battle and I was able to see the battle

99
00:08:48.38 --> 00:08:53.38
The battle was over, I got to work on the building, the honor of the soldier

100
00:08:57.38 --> 00:09:00.38
My brother's seals looked unbelievably smooth, fast and aggressive

101
00:09:00.38 --> 00:09:03.38
as they stormed the suspected enemy building

102
00:09:06.38 --> 00:09:08.38
I felt proud

103
00:09:09.38 --> 00:09:12.38
After a few minutes they exited that building and reboarded the Bradleys

104
00:09:12.38 --> 00:09:14.38
which then took them to another building

105
00:09:14.38 --> 00:09:17.98
Soon the seals entered another building, again looking smooth and aggressive.

106
00:09:20.06 --> 00:09:24.86
I couldn't believe how good my guys were, so professional, so bold, so glorious.

107
00:09:31.90 --> 00:09:40.94
Then, a minute later, I saw two seals carrying a motionless man quickly out of the building.

108
00:09:40.94 --> 00:09:44.94
My heart sunk.

109
00:09:48.22 --> 00:09:52.54
We have a man down, I said to the tactical operations center.

110
00:09:53.58 --> 00:10:00.14
Maybe it's an Iraqi soldier someone suggested. No, they had no Iraqis with them. It's one of ours.

111
00:10:03.74 --> 00:10:09.34
The room got extremely quiet. I focused on the radio and listened for details.

112
00:10:09.34 --> 00:10:14.70
Mike Baymo is working to get the casualty to Charlie Med, the medical facility on Camp Romadi.

113
00:10:14.70 --> 00:10:16.62
I still couldn't hear lay for any of the seals.

114
00:10:20.70 --> 00:10:24.06
Then I heard Mike Baymo say, I need to get this KIA moved.

115
00:10:28.70 --> 00:10:30.30
KIA killed in action.

116
00:10:30.30 --> 00:10:39.42
I gave the River City order, Navy speak for shutting down all external communications.

117
00:10:39.42 --> 00:10:43.34
I told the person posting operational updates to stop writing.

118
00:10:46.22 --> 00:10:51.66
The tactical operations center watched in silence as the rest of the seals finished

119
00:10:51.66 --> 00:10:55.42
securing the target building, then left loading back on the Bradley's.

120
00:10:55.42 --> 00:11:01.50
The Bradley's headed back toward combat outpost Falcon.

121
00:11:06.70 --> 00:11:12.06
Soon, Leif got on one of the base station radio and called Red Bull six. This is Red Bull one six.

122
00:11:14.22 --> 00:11:18.06
I keyed up the radio Red Bull one six. This is Red Bull six go.

123
00:11:18.06 --> 00:11:28.06
Leif with so much emotion in his voice that it almost sounded emotionless said we had another casualty.

124
00:11:30.46 --> 00:11:32.06
I think he's KIA.

125
00:11:36.30 --> 00:11:40.70
This radio net was monitored by the entire brigade, so we were both doing our best to remain

126
00:11:40.70 --> 00:11:47.74
professional. Also to prevent names of casualties from leaking out. We do not use names on the radio.

127
00:11:47.74 --> 00:11:53.10
Instead, everyone is assigned a platoon number, which consists of a letter for their platoon

128
00:11:53.66 --> 00:11:55.42
and a number that indicates who they are.

129
00:11:58.70 --> 00:12:02.38
We keep the platoon numbers in the tactical operations center on a board.

130
00:12:04.94 --> 00:12:08.46
I responded to Leif, Roger, who is the casualty?

131
00:12:08.46 --> 00:12:24.14
There was a pause and then he responded slowly and clearly. Charlie won four.

132
00:12:28.06 --> 00:12:29.50
I looked up at the board slowly.

133
00:12:32.38 --> 00:12:33.50
I didn't want to see the name,

134
00:12:33.50 --> 00:12:39.34
but there it was. Charlie won four.

135
00:12:41.74 --> 00:12:42.22
Mark Lee.

136
00:12:47.18 --> 00:12:53.42
I couldn't believe it. Our pillar of courage and faith that seemed impossible.

137
00:12:56.46 --> 00:12:57.66
I asked Leif to confirm.

138
00:12:59.90 --> 00:13:01.66
Can you confirm with his initials?

139
00:13:01.66 --> 00:13:05.42
Leif replied, Roger,

140
00:13:08.78 --> 00:13:09.42
Mike Lima,

141
00:13:12.14 --> 00:13:14.78
Roger. I replied.

142
00:13:20.38 --> 00:13:21.10
Mark was gone.

143
00:13:25.26 --> 00:13:26.86
It was pure devastation.

144
00:13:26.86 --> 00:13:34.62
We had lost one of our brothers and one of our pillars of courage.

145
00:13:41.26 --> 00:13:44.06
Everyone in Ramadi that wasn't actively fighting

146
00:13:44.06 --> 00:13:53.98
showed up later that night to see Mark onto the helicopter for his final flight home.

147
00:13:57.42 --> 00:14:02.06
It was late at night and the path from the medical building to the airfield

148
00:14:02.70 --> 00:14:06.86
was lined with sailors, soldiers, Marines and airmen.

149
00:14:06.86 --> 00:14:15.58
The forces we worked alongside were also completely distraught by Mark's death.

150
00:14:18.30 --> 00:14:20.06
They thought we were indestructible.

151
00:14:22.46 --> 00:14:26.30
Now they realized we were flesh and blood like them.

152
00:14:30.22 --> 00:14:33.98
Many of them knew Mark. They remembered him.

153
00:14:33.98 --> 00:14:43.66
Now they all knew he was flesh and blood like them, but that made his courage and spirit all the

154
00:14:43.66 --> 00:14:44.70
more profound.

155
00:14:51.02 --> 00:14:52.86
Charlie won four. Mark Lee.

156
00:14:52.86 --> 00:15:05.50
Mark will always be remembered not just as a man, a seal, a husband, a brother, a son,

157
00:15:06.38 --> 00:15:17.34
but as a hero who personified love, faith and courage and one who inspires us all.

158
00:15:17.34 --> 00:15:29.34
We will never forget the gift that God gave to us. Mark Lee who touched us so briefly,

159
00:15:29.34 --> 00:15:30.22
but so deeply.

160
00:15:34.78 --> 00:15:36.54
He will be with us forever.

161
00:15:36.54 --> 00:16:02.86
Mark Lee's mom, Debbie Lee, who we call momily, and I wrote it to share with her what Mark meant

162
00:16:02.86 --> 00:16:12.78
to us and one perspective of what had transpired the day that he was killed.

163
00:16:16.54 --> 00:16:24.06
And momily was unbelievably strong when Mark died and during our initial calls to her

164
00:16:24.06 --> 00:16:33.82
where we called with the intent of offering her support and sympathy and comfort.

165
00:16:36.22 --> 00:16:37.82
It was actually the opposite that took place.

166
00:16:40.30 --> 00:16:43.58
It was she who comforted us.

167
00:16:47.26 --> 00:16:51.34
It was momily that was asking how is everyone doing? Is there anything that you guys need?

168
00:16:51.34 --> 00:16:57.10
I am praying for all of you. She was so strong.

169
00:17:01.10 --> 00:17:01.90
And she still is.

170
00:17:05.82 --> 00:17:13.58
But it certainly has not been easy. The loss of a child is unimaginable to everyone.

171
00:17:13.58 --> 00:17:22.14
And yet somehow she has endured and she set an example for all of us to follow.

172
00:17:23.82 --> 00:17:30.70
And it's an honor to have her with us here tonight to share with her, share with us some

173
00:17:30.70 --> 00:17:38.14
of her experiences and her lessons learned and also to share the story of the warrior and hero

174
00:17:38.14 --> 00:17:45.02
that she raised, Mark Lee. Momily, thanks for joining us.

175
00:17:46.70 --> 00:17:52.94
You bet. Thanks for having me. And I remember when you sent that to me and the impact

176
00:17:53.90 --> 00:17:59.50
that it made when I read that. And obviously it's been 16 and a half years since we lost Mark.

177
00:18:00.70 --> 00:18:04.78
And still, when you read that, you know, I got a, you know, bump in my throat and

178
00:18:04.78 --> 00:18:11.50
making sure I keep it together here. But I know how much you guys loved Mark and I know how much

179
00:18:12.14 --> 00:18:19.58
that burden that you guys carry. And as you've heard me often say, you know, Mark was my kid who

180
00:18:19.58 --> 00:18:25.10
loved to give gifts. I mean, he would spend hours. It wasn't a bag it and tag it, get out of here,

181
00:18:25.10 --> 00:18:31.02
check mission accomplished. He would spend hours looking for just the perfect gift.

182
00:18:31.02 --> 00:18:36.06
And he would be so stinking excited when he got that gift. And I remember at Christmas time,

183
00:18:36.06 --> 00:18:42.46
he'd bought me a set of gold flatware, not solid gold, but golden color. And it matched my China

184
00:18:42.46 --> 00:18:47.66
perfectly. I had a gold rim around my white China. And he was so excited. And he came home and he had

185
00:18:47.66 --> 00:18:53.42
it wrapped in the store. And he came home and he's like, Mom, wait until you see what I got for you.

186
00:18:53.42 --> 00:18:58.70
I'm like, Oh, cool. Thanks, honey. And he goes, You got to open it now, Mom. I'm like, No, put it

187
00:18:58.70 --> 00:19:02.30
under the tree. Oh, and I haven't seen it open Christmas day if you don't put it under there.

188
00:19:02.86 --> 00:19:08.86
And he started to rip the package open because he couldn't wait. He was so excited at what he had

189
00:19:08.86 --> 00:19:14.46
found. And he knew that it would be something that would please me. And he ripped it open and showed

190
00:19:14.46 --> 00:19:20.22
it to me. And I realized after he passed away, he tried to explain the brotherhood thing to me

191
00:19:20.22 --> 00:19:25.34
before. I'm like, Yeah, yeah, I get it. You're close to these guys. But as close as your brother

192
00:19:25.34 --> 00:19:31.90
you grew up with for 28 years. He's like, Yeah, mom, that close. And I joked and I said, Well,

193
00:19:31.90 --> 00:19:36.46
let me mind you, I didn't birth them. So they really can't be your brothers. And we left it at that.

194
00:19:36.46 --> 00:19:41.34
And I had, you know, five of his friends, I mean, you guys were all still deployed, but some of us

195
00:19:41.34 --> 00:19:45.66
a swim buddy and some others that first week, you know, when he had been killed that were in our

196
00:19:45.66 --> 00:19:51.18
house. And I saw, Oh my gosh, they love Marcus as much as we do. And they're hurting just as bad as

197
00:19:51.18 --> 00:19:57.82
we are. And I remember, I think, you know, the first time officially that I had told the Charlie

198
00:19:57.82 --> 00:20:05.50
boys was I had met with President Bush in October of 2006. And I was telling them all about you guys,

199
00:20:05.50 --> 00:20:09.58
I had the team picture there. You know, and I remember even saying in Jocko Willings there,

200
00:20:09.58 --> 00:20:13.50
he goes, Well, I've heard that name before. Jocko willing. I'm like, Who is this Jocko willing

201
00:20:13.50 --> 00:20:17.98
guy that you know, even the admiral when we went in the day before the funeral was, you know,

202
00:20:17.98 --> 00:20:22.78
talking about Jocko willing and that you are crucial and getting the Silver Star award for him.

203
00:20:22.78 --> 00:20:28.62
And typically that takes a while. And yet we had it for the funeral was presented posthumously to

204
00:20:28.62 --> 00:20:37.58
us. But my final gift was you guys, you know, and he intended for me to open that immediately and

205
00:20:37.58 --> 00:20:41.98
get to know you guys. And that's why when you're deployed, it was, you know, we had phone calls.

206
00:20:41.98 --> 00:20:46.14
It wasn't just that first one, you know, we emailed back and forth, I got the team picture,

207
00:20:46.14 --> 00:20:49.74
and I put names on it so I could learn the faces. So when you guys came home, and

208
00:20:51.42 --> 00:20:56.94
that was Mark's final gift to me. And I knew it was a special gift in the beginning.

209
00:20:58.06 --> 00:21:03.42
But man, it is a priceless gift that you guys have been to me and to our mission

210
00:21:03.42 --> 00:21:09.02
at America's Mighty Warriors. And I love you guys. And so blessed to have you in my life. So

211
00:21:09.02 --> 00:21:19.90
I know sometimes that gift is a little bit more than you want. When it was the timing of things,

212
00:21:19.90 --> 00:21:26.78
the way things happen. General Brown, who is the SOCOM commander. So he was the four star general

213
00:21:26.78 --> 00:21:35.58
in charge of all of special operations. He came to Ramadi on August 2nd on a VIP visit. He was

214
00:21:35.58 --> 00:21:40.62
touring all of his, all of, you know, the troops, the special operations troops around the world.

215
00:21:40.62 --> 00:21:46.06
And he came to Ramadi on August 2nd. He got there probably around lunchtime.

216
00:21:47.66 --> 00:21:55.42
And he stayed. And he actually was one of the people on the flight line. And, you know, I was,

217
00:21:55.42 --> 00:22:03.26
I had worked for Admiral McGuire. And Admiral McGuire, General Brown had left. And then he had

218
00:22:03.26 --> 00:22:07.98
sent an email to Admiral McGuire. And Admiral McGuire forwarded the email to me. And it was a

219
00:22:07.98 --> 00:22:13.90
beautiful email. And he basically described the situation of what he had seen of, you know, the

220
00:22:14.86 --> 00:22:20.46
hundreds of soldiers and Marines that were outlining the runway and or lining the pathway to the runway.

221
00:22:20.46 --> 00:22:24.54
And, you know, it's dark outside. There's cam lights along. And it's in a war zone.

222
00:22:25.42 --> 00:22:30.06
And he asked the question, you know, he said, all these guys are out here. And this guy who

223
00:22:30.06 --> 00:22:33.90
I've, you know, we told him about Mark, we told him as much as we could in a couple hours that he

224
00:22:33.90 --> 00:22:42.62
was there. And General Brown basically closed out the email with, where do we get such young men?

225
00:22:44.06 --> 00:22:50.78
And I think that's, you know, a great way to start off trying to figure out how you raised Mark,

226
00:22:50.78 --> 00:22:58.46
where he came from. Like, where did this guy who was willing to give so much. And it's interesting,

227
00:22:58.46 --> 00:23:03.58
you know, we just had George Montsoir on talking about Mikey. And oddly enough, one of the things

228
00:23:03.58 --> 00:23:09.10
that he mentioned was, Oh, Mikey loved to give gifts. He would, you know, even if he had to make

229
00:23:09.10 --> 00:23:13.98
them or find them out in the street and put together something, he loved to give gifts.

230
00:23:13.98 --> 00:23:20.14
And it's just incredible that here's Mark same way, same mentality. But to dig down, like,

231
00:23:20.14 --> 00:23:25.90
let's start with you a little bit. Where'd you grow up? What were what your parents do? What was

232
00:23:25.90 --> 00:23:32.86
going on with your life before before Mark came? Yeah, so I was born in Greeley, Colorado, which

233
00:23:32.86 --> 00:23:39.58
is about an hour north of Denver, kind of came in difficult circumstances. My mom at 17 had got

234
00:23:39.58 --> 00:23:44.78
pregnant with me. And there's two sides that I've heard the stories. I don't know which one's true,

235
00:23:44.78 --> 00:23:51.82
but for whatever reason, my mom ended up not marrying my biological father. And, you know,

236
00:23:51.82 --> 00:23:58.38
back then, that was something that was a terrible shame. And so you tried, you know, they sent the

237
00:23:58.38 --> 00:24:04.22
girls away for a while or and my grandmother and I think they were doing the best they could with

238
00:24:04.22 --> 00:24:10.06
who they were and what was handed to them. But my grandmother wanting to protect my mom and have me

239
00:24:10.06 --> 00:24:20.54
not born at a wedlock had my mom marry her boyfriend. So my mom's 17, this guy's 35. My mom told

240
00:24:20.54 --> 00:24:23.90
different personality than me. If that had been me, I'd be like, thank you very much. I'll raise

241
00:24:23.90 --> 00:24:28.06
this child by myself. I'm not marrying that old fart, you know, because it's 17. That's a huge

242
00:24:28.06 --> 00:24:33.66
difference. And it was just supposed to be, I guess, temporary, and then have the marriage

243
00:24:33.66 --> 00:24:39.34
in old afterwards. But that never happened. He was a police officer for the city of Greeley.

244
00:24:39.34 --> 00:24:46.46
And I didn't know any different as a child. Wait, did your grandma give away her boyfriend to the

245
00:24:46.46 --> 00:24:52.54
the? Yeah. That's cool. That's weird. Yes, very weird. That's what I said. It just, but again,

246
00:24:52.54 --> 00:25:00.62
I think with who they were, with the lack of education, they had what they thought would be

247
00:25:00.62 --> 00:25:05.10
a solution, right? You know, you're not going to really sleep whether you don't get any of those

248
00:25:05.10 --> 00:25:10.70
privileges, you're just going to get married then annul the marriage and. Okay, that's what they were

249
00:25:10.70 --> 00:25:15.58
trying to make up. Got it. Yeah, I think that's what you were born into. That's what I was born

250
00:25:15.58 --> 00:25:22.38
so then did you grow up with your 17 year old mom? I did. Yes. And what about brothers and sisters?

251
00:25:22.38 --> 00:25:27.02
I'm the only child for my biological dad. I hate it when people ask these questions sometimes

252
00:25:27.02 --> 00:25:32.30
because it is a very dysfunctional family. But again, I didn't know he wasn't my father until

253
00:25:32.30 --> 00:25:40.38
I was 16. So then they had twin sisters a year after I was born. One died within 12 hours of

254
00:25:40.38 --> 00:25:44.54
birth and one died in 24 hours of birth. So I didn't know them, you know, I knew growing up that

255
00:25:44.54 --> 00:25:51.74
there were twin sisters that had died. And then my mom and who I thought was my biological dad

256
00:25:51.74 --> 00:25:56.54
had my brother, Vance, who was two and a half years younger than me. And that's, you know,

257
00:25:56.54 --> 00:26:00.94
who I thought was my family and who I grew up with. My mom went through a divorce when I was

258
00:26:00.94 --> 00:26:08.94
about 11 and then got pregnant again and married the father of that baby. And I was kind of like

259
00:26:08.94 --> 00:26:13.74
a mom to him was 13 and my mom was trying to figure out life and she was struggling herself,

260
00:26:13.74 --> 00:26:19.18
you know. And so I was kind of his mama for a while. And then I left home when I was 16. So

261
00:26:19.90 --> 00:26:23.26
that was when I found out who my dad was. And that's kind of when things all just

262
00:26:24.14 --> 00:26:28.46
fell apart. So when you found out who your dad was, did that just cause a reaction to be like,

263
00:26:28.46 --> 00:26:32.30
all right, I'm out of here? Or did you go live with him? Did you track him down? What happened?

264
00:26:32.30 --> 00:26:36.54
I did track him down. Finally met him. And of course, when I was 11, I was five foot nine already.

265
00:26:36.54 --> 00:26:41.02
My mom was five foot six. My dad was five foot five. They're really worse than he tall relatives.

266
00:26:41.02 --> 00:26:46.22
And that's when you start studying, you know, the biology and your DNA. And I'm like,

267
00:26:46.22 --> 00:26:52.54
oh my some kind of freak that I met my dad. He was six foot four, as he tells me on the phone

268
00:26:52.54 --> 00:26:58.30
call and five foot on the other. He'd lost his leg in a tractor accident the year that I was born.

269
00:26:59.02 --> 00:27:03.74
And so because the circumstances, my mom and I were fighting when, you know,

270
00:27:03.74 --> 00:27:07.90
she told me about him. She said, you don't even know who your dad is, you know. And again,

271
00:27:07.90 --> 00:27:12.06
you go back to that hurt people want to hurt other people when they're hurting.

272
00:27:12.70 --> 00:27:17.18
Of course, being a little bit of rebel and strong will, I said, do you and courses

273
00:27:17.18 --> 00:27:22.06
whack up across the side of the face, you know, and that was disrespectful and not called for.

274
00:27:22.06 --> 00:27:28.30
But you know, that's a sensitive conversation that you sit down and you prepare for a conversation

275
00:27:28.30 --> 00:27:33.18
to tell somebody something like that, not in the moment of anger when you're fighting. So

276
00:27:33.18 --> 00:27:39.74
it cost a lot of problems, you know, between my mom and I. I did connect with my dad and started

277
00:27:39.74 --> 00:27:44.78
to kind of get to know him and found out I had another brother from the marriage he was in at

278
00:27:44.78 --> 00:27:50.14
the time, three siblings from his first marriage, and then he married again and she had several kids.

279
00:27:50.14 --> 00:27:56.06
So there's me, they're an only child or I come from a family 13. But again, I think that's and

280
00:27:56.06 --> 00:28:02.38
I don't want people at all to, you know, have a pity party for me. These as you go back to Mark

281
00:28:02.38 --> 00:28:09.10
and how he was raised, these tough circumstances in my life are what gave me the opportunity to

282
00:28:09.10 --> 00:28:14.62
persevere and not quit. And it's just like when you guys are going through your training at Buds,

283
00:28:14.62 --> 00:28:20.06
they push you to the limit to see what you can endure. And when you don't give up, when you

284
00:28:20.06 --> 00:28:25.66
persevere and when you have that attitude, man, that's what prepared me for the toughest day,

285
00:28:25.66 --> 00:28:30.54
August 2nd, you know, losing Mark, or then I knew I could still stand. I knew it would be tough.

286
00:28:30.54 --> 00:28:37.18
But those tragedies and trials that you go through in life, I love school, got good grades in school,

287
00:28:37.18 --> 00:28:40.22
I was a cheerleader in school, so I had a blast. I love school.

288
00:28:40.22 --> 00:28:42.22
So when you were 16, where'd you move out to?

289
00:28:42.22 --> 00:28:43.58
I went and lived with an aunt.

290
00:28:44.14 --> 00:28:45.90
And then, but you're still going to school?

291
00:28:45.90 --> 00:28:46.46
Still going to school.

292
00:28:46.46 --> 00:28:47.42
You're getting good grades.

293
00:28:47.42 --> 00:28:49.10
You're on a good path.

294
00:28:49.10 --> 00:28:49.66
Yeah.

295
00:28:49.66 --> 00:28:53.18
Are you thinking about going to college? What's what you're thinking about for your future?

296
00:28:53.18 --> 00:28:59.02
I didn't have real big goals at the time. I did get several scholarships that I turned down

297
00:28:59.02 --> 00:29:06.30
because I just wanted to be a wife and a mother. The school that I went to was, you know, a very

298
00:29:06.30 --> 00:29:11.58
poor part of town. I was one of the minorities, you know, it was primarily black and Hispanic in

299
00:29:11.58 --> 00:29:19.90
the school. And I was one of the oldest at 18. I got married just weeks after I turned 18.

300
00:29:19.90 --> 00:29:25.82
I was one of the oldest to not, you know, latest to get married or have kids. That was what our

301
00:29:25.82 --> 00:29:26.30
problem was.

302
00:29:26.30 --> 00:29:28.78
What was the population in your high school? Was it like a small town?

303
00:29:28.78 --> 00:29:33.90
Small. Well, no, it was in Denver. It was a suburb of Denver. There was probably 300

304
00:29:33.90 --> 00:29:34.94
in the total school.

305
00:29:34.94 --> 00:29:36.22
But everyone's just getting married.

306
00:29:36.86 --> 00:29:37.90
Well, or getting pregnant.

307
00:29:37.90 --> 00:29:39.10
Getting pregnant or getting married.

308
00:29:39.10 --> 00:29:40.30
Having babies, yeah.

309
00:29:40.30 --> 00:29:41.90
And you get married when you're 18 years old?

310
00:29:41.90 --> 00:29:43.50
I get married when I'm 18.

311
00:29:43.50 --> 00:29:44.86
And is this Mark's dad?

312
00:29:44.86 --> 00:29:47.42
This is all my kid's dad, yes. So, married at 18.

313
00:29:47.42 --> 00:29:48.30
And who was this dude?

314
00:29:49.50 --> 00:29:54.94
He was, you know, played on the football team. He was two years older than me.

315
00:29:54.94 --> 00:29:59.58
Because I didn't have that father figure growing up that really gave me love.

316
00:29:59.58 --> 00:30:05.50
I didn't know what love was. And I just wanted to be loved. And so, you know, some of those

317
00:30:05.50 --> 00:30:09.90
things that I interpreted, you know, sexual relationship as love, which it wasn't, you

318
00:30:09.90 --> 00:30:14.78
know? But that was the first time he used to walk three miles to my house every night to

319
00:30:14.78 --> 00:30:18.62
come see me, which I walk five miles a day. So I guess three miles isn't that big a deal.

320
00:30:18.62 --> 00:30:23.58
But back then it was. I was like, holy cow. That's a, you know, and I was like, okay, that's

321
00:30:23.58 --> 00:30:30.70
got to be what love is. And my mom forbid me to marry him. Like I said, I'm strong-willed.

322
00:30:30.70 --> 00:30:36.22
And he don't forbid a strong-willed person to do something because that just pushes them to

323
00:30:36.22 --> 00:30:44.30
prove to you. And literally, as a rebel, that was the reason that I married, you know, intended

324
00:30:44.30 --> 00:30:48.30
for it to be for life, you know, really thought that that's what would happen.

325
00:30:48.30 --> 00:30:50.46
So had he graduated from high school already?

326
00:30:50.46 --> 00:30:52.06
He had graduated from high school already.

327
00:30:52.06 --> 00:30:53.90
And what was he doing for a living?

328
00:30:53.90 --> 00:30:59.98
You know, the time, I don't remember what he was doing for a living. He had been in trouble.

329
00:30:59.98 --> 00:31:06.94
And back then he was a Marine and was because he'd been in trouble, they're like, here's your

330
00:31:06.94 --> 00:31:13.42
option. You go to jail or you go on the Marines. And so I didn't know the extent of all of that,

331
00:31:13.42 --> 00:31:17.58
you know, that that was the reason that he was in the Marines. But I think he had just recently,

332
00:31:17.58 --> 00:31:23.50
that would have been in 72, so probably just recently got out of the Marines.

333
00:31:24.14 --> 00:31:30.22
And so we married, had my first son Christopher when I was 20 and had my daughter at 21.

334
00:31:31.18 --> 00:31:39.10
And alcohol was something for him that was, he was an alcoholic, but Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde,

335
00:31:39.10 --> 00:31:45.58
when he drank and was very abusive and finally tried to kill me. And at 23, I said,

336
00:31:45.58 --> 00:31:51.58
and I think for me, my self-esteem was so bad back then. I felt like I deserved it.

337
00:31:51.58 --> 00:31:56.30
And I don't feel ever that that's the circumstance. I think the only time a guy should ever hurt a

338
00:31:56.30 --> 00:32:03.82
woman is she's trying to kill him, you know, and he's defending himself. But so it was,

339
00:32:03.82 --> 00:32:08.38
it was some tough, crazy times, you know, and I was going to persevere and show my mom I could

340
00:32:08.38 --> 00:32:13.90
make this work. But when it came to that point, he used to, he'd act like in the beginning,

341
00:32:13.90 --> 00:32:17.66
like he's going to throw a punch at me and he'd get right to my face. And then he'd bring his

342
00:32:17.66 --> 00:32:22.54
hand up to his nose and itch his nose. And he did that to Christopher at three years old. And I

343
00:32:22.54 --> 00:32:31.50
think that was for me, the holy crap. Maybe I deserved it, but my kids don't. And so it was at

344
00:32:31.50 --> 00:32:36.54
that point, you know, that I finally said, and we separated, we were together and apart and together

345
00:32:36.54 --> 00:32:41.02
and apart and together and apart. But at that point, I was like, I am done. This is not happening

346
00:32:41.02 --> 00:32:45.66
again. And because of all the violence in the marriage, the day that I filed for the divorce,

347
00:32:45.66 --> 00:32:51.18
it was final. And I found out two ex-ladars pregnant with Mark. And they heard two heartbeats

348
00:32:51.18 --> 00:32:57.34
the entire time. This was not when they did ultrasounds, you know, to find out early on,

349
00:32:57.34 --> 00:33:02.30
you know, where the health of the baby or the sex of the baby. And but they always heard two

350
00:33:02.30 --> 00:33:08.30
heartbeats. You knew Mark, he was like, okay, that's why my body had two heartbeats. But again,

351
00:33:08.30 --> 00:33:14.86
what a blessing. And it's such a dark time in my life. And you talked about his humor, you know,

352
00:33:14.86 --> 00:33:21.82
and the joy that he had. And even from a young age, such a smiley baby and giggly baby. And he

353
00:33:21.82 --> 00:33:28.14
would tell these knock, knock jokes. He was probably about four. And oh my gosh, chocolate, they were

354
00:33:28.14 --> 00:33:34.30
so bad. But he thought he was hilarious. And again, knowing Mark, you can piece this together. He'd

355
00:33:34.30 --> 00:33:39.82
be laying on the floor as a child, just laughing, laughing, laughing. And you couldn't help but laugh

356
00:33:39.82 --> 00:33:46.70
at him, you know, laughing at himself. And so then he thought he was really good. But got class

357
00:33:46.70 --> 00:33:53.66
clown two years in a row. And I'm like, and that's going to get you to college. How? But what a blessing

358
00:33:53.66 --> 00:33:59.66
and what a gift, you know, the struggles again, you know, that you go through in life, that we have

359
00:33:59.66 --> 00:34:06.78
a choice. And we can let that defeat us. Or we can overcome that. And with the perseverance,

360
00:34:06.78 --> 00:34:10.38
that's, you know, what I chose to do. I wasn't going to quit. I wasn't going to give up.

361
00:34:10.38 --> 00:34:15.66
You put up so much put up with so much in the marriage. But it sounds like the turning point

362
00:34:15.66 --> 00:34:22.46
was when you saw that your husband at the time might hurt your kids. And that was just like

363
00:34:22.46 --> 00:34:28.78
the breaking point, like I'm done with this. Now, what do you do when you're 23 years old,

364
00:34:28.78 --> 00:34:33.66
you're got two kids, and you got one on the way? Where'd you go? How do you how do you get through

365
00:34:33.66 --> 00:34:39.42
that? So I was working at started working for Tech Tonics, which is a manufacturer of

366
00:34:40.94 --> 00:34:45.42
equipment, different electronic equipment. And it was a little bit a little bit better

367
00:34:45.42 --> 00:34:50.78
paying job, but still not a good job. What were you doing for them? Just assembling

368
00:34:50.78 --> 00:34:56.38
just on the manufacturing line. And that's not me at all. I mean, I'm good at it. I was skilled.

369
00:34:56.38 --> 00:35:02.06
I could, you know, I think a kid of 10 to 40 hours is what they, you know, figured it should

370
00:35:02.06 --> 00:35:06.06
take you to build it. And I could build it in 36. And they're like, check her QC, she can't be doing

371
00:35:06.06 --> 00:35:11.74
this, right? But there was no challenge once I got that done, you know, I'm a very people person.

372
00:35:11.74 --> 00:35:16.78
So I need to do something where I feel like I'm making a difference in somebody's life and changing

373
00:35:16.78 --> 00:35:22.86
things. Had several jobs, you know, one point, I was working three jobs, 96 hours a week,

374
00:35:22.86 --> 00:35:27.18
was managing bank during the day. And I'm not sure when we went through the divorce,

375
00:35:27.18 --> 00:35:32.78
so I still work in one of the banks, but managing bank, tending bar at night,

376
00:35:32.78 --> 00:35:38.86
tending bar on the weekends, you know, just, just to take care of my kids, getting child support,

377
00:35:38.86 --> 00:35:42.30
you know, he didn't take him at all. He wasn't in their lives. Who's watching the kids when all

378
00:35:42.30 --> 00:35:50.14
this is going on? I had him either in home daycare or in a childcare center. But basically,

379
00:35:50.14 --> 00:35:56.94
the second job was to pay for the childcare. So yeah. And then so this is all taking place. Is

380
00:35:56.94 --> 00:36:01.50
this all taking place in Colorado still? Yeah, I'm still in Colorado at that point. And then

381
00:36:01.50 --> 00:36:07.42
will the kids start going to school? Do you do you get onto like a legit like a more regimented

382
00:36:07.42 --> 00:36:13.98
career path at some point? I would say it was probably 28. When I got a little more

383
00:36:13.98 --> 00:36:20.22
goal-oriented at that point, it was just survival. You know, I'm not thinking about me or how, you

384
00:36:20.22 --> 00:36:24.86
know, looking ahead, you know, I'm downward looking going, okay, I got to feed them, I got to get

385
00:36:24.86 --> 00:36:32.14
closed, we got to be here, we got to go there. And I was probably 28. Then when I had some health

386
00:36:32.14 --> 00:36:36.70
issues, and it's like, okay, what do I really want to do? What I want to be when I grow up?

387
00:36:37.42 --> 00:36:42.22
And that's when I, I loved flying. And I was like, you know what, I'm going back to school

388
00:36:42.22 --> 00:36:48.86
to be a pilot. And so at 28 with three little kids, I went back to school. Was it

389
00:36:48.86 --> 00:36:54.30
Metro State College? It's now a university in Denver, but and went back to school to become a pilot.

390
00:36:54.86 --> 00:36:59.34
And how'd that go? Well, it went really well until I fell and injured my back and could

391
00:36:59.34 --> 00:37:06.62
pass my first class medical. And again, that was, I mean, for my kids, they already had been through

392
00:37:06.62 --> 00:37:10.38
so much. And now I'm going to fly the friendly skies and someone else is going to raise them when

393
00:37:10.38 --> 00:37:16.78
I'm gone. And of course, I had fed myself the lies of it's not, you know, it's not the quantity of

394
00:37:16.78 --> 00:37:20.54
time that I spend with them, it's the quality. So if I'm only with them a couple of days, I'll

395
00:37:20.54 --> 00:37:26.30
make that be good days out of the month. And I think part of it, you know, I was so tired at that

396
00:37:26.30 --> 00:37:32.30
point of trying to maintain and do this all by myself, that it was kind of like, okay, that's my

397
00:37:32.30 --> 00:37:37.10
little escape. Yeah, you're like, maybe a four day trip with flying an airplane. All right,

398
00:37:37.10 --> 00:37:41.50
these old rascals out of my hair for who would have they been, you know,

399
00:37:42.14 --> 00:37:47.18
we wouldn't have had Mark being a Navy SEAL, you know, so did you make that connection? Like you

400
00:37:47.18 --> 00:37:50.30
hurt your back and then you're thinking, you know, what am I going to do? Am I really going to fly

401
00:37:50.30 --> 00:37:56.54
around the country while my kids are at? Yeah, I think it was after that point. That was for me.

402
00:37:56.54 --> 00:38:01.58
And I grew up in a Christian home. And, you know, accepted Christ as a child, but we didn't live it

403
00:38:01.58 --> 00:38:06.22
in our home. That wasn't taught to us with church on Sunday. But that was about it. But for me,

404
00:38:06.22 --> 00:38:11.66
that was when I completely surrendered my life. I had made a mess of my life. I had fought God,

405
00:38:11.66 --> 00:38:17.10
you know, I thought he wanted to make me this mamzy, Pamzy, wimpy, you know, have no backbone.

406
00:38:17.10 --> 00:38:23.50
I'm like, I ain't going there. And because I had made such a mess, I literally spent three months on

407
00:38:23.50 --> 00:38:28.06
my back where I couldn't hardly roll over. And they didn't know if I'd walk again. And like,

408
00:38:28.06 --> 00:38:32.78
the only place I could look was up. I'm like, Oh, you were trying to get my attention, weren't

409
00:38:32.78 --> 00:38:37.74
you? You used a two by four and I ignored you and used a four by four and I just kept going.

410
00:38:37.74 --> 00:38:42.94
And now the freight train hit me and oh, and so I came to a place where I said,

411
00:38:42.94 --> 00:38:48.14
I've made a mess in my life. It's not much. But what I've got, I'm laying at your feet. You take it.

412
00:38:48.14 --> 00:38:51.82
And I'm not going to pass go. I'm not going to collect $200. I will stay here and not get in

413
00:38:51.82 --> 00:38:56.22
trouble anymore. Just put me on the shelf. I got it. Thank you for your forgiveness of all you've

414
00:38:56.22 --> 00:39:04.06
done in my life. And that was the point that he said, I made you the way you are. Why would I

415
00:39:04.06 --> 00:39:10.38
want to make you a mamzy, Pamzy wimpy? But I didn't understand who he was. So for me, that was the

416
00:39:10.38 --> 00:39:17.26
major turning point in my life where I started reading my Bible every day, learning who he is,

417
00:39:17.26 --> 00:39:25.98
studying his character. And for me, no doubt, that was the strength, how I got through losing

418
00:39:25.98 --> 00:39:33.42
Mark and continue to every single day. But yeah. So then what was it like? So you make that turn

419
00:39:33.42 --> 00:39:38.30
in your life. You kind of surrender yourself, okay, I'm going to focus on what I've got.

420
00:39:38.86 --> 00:39:43.50
And then what then pragmatically, what did that look like in day to day? Like, did you get into

421
00:39:43.50 --> 00:39:47.58
what was your new job? And now you can't fly anymore. So what did you proceed with in that?

422
00:39:48.22 --> 00:39:55.42
Well, I had remarried just shortly before that. So, you know, he was the wage earner

423
00:39:55.42 --> 00:40:00.86
for the family. He was a long haul trucker. And so at that point, you know, we'd had some

424
00:40:00.86 --> 00:40:06.06
major problems with one of our kiddos. And I was like, I just need to focus on them. They've been

425
00:40:06.06 --> 00:40:11.18
through so much. You know, they've got to have some stability. And how old were they when you got

426
00:40:11.18 --> 00:40:20.38
remarried? They were 11, 9 and 7, I believe. And how was that transition bringing the new dad and

427
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:26.94
on the scene? It was rough. You know, Christopher, my oldest, he'd been the little man, you know,

428
00:40:26.94 --> 00:40:32.78
and he struggled and felt like because he wasn't the little man anymore, he wasn't loved. And so,

429
00:40:32.78 --> 00:40:38.94
oh man, we had some crazy stuff, you know, that we had to work through. And so at that time,

430
00:40:38.94 --> 00:40:44.14
you know, I really tried to focus on being a better mom, helping them and supporting them.

431
00:40:44.94 --> 00:40:50.14
Then we moved to Oregon. My mom had a preschool and kindergarten there. And so, you know, I started

432
00:40:50.14 --> 00:40:55.66
working with her. I've always loved kids. And she basically did kindergarten, first grade,

433
00:40:55.66 --> 00:41:00.06
and second grade, so private Christian school at the beginning ages. And I started a preschool

434
00:41:00.06 --> 00:41:04.54
program for her there. And then eventually ended up purchasing the school from her. And

435
00:41:05.58 --> 00:41:11.26
that's where, you know, my mission was, was these kids and loving on them and, you know,

436
00:41:11.98 --> 00:41:15.98
helping their parents raise them and be the best they can, you know, when the parents couldn't

437
00:41:15.98 --> 00:41:21.50
be there. I still 100% believe if parents have the opportunity to be home with your kids, I know

438
00:41:21.50 --> 00:41:25.82
a lot of them can't, but make that sacrifice for, you know, one of those parents to be there.

439
00:41:25.82 --> 00:41:30.06
Because I think they turn out so, you know, so different. And people are like, oh yeah,

440
00:41:30.06 --> 00:41:33.74
I'll be there in the beginning years. I'll stay home. They need you the teen years just as much

441
00:41:33.74 --> 00:41:39.74
as they do in the beginning. But I understand, excuse me, not everybody has the, you know,

442
00:41:39.74 --> 00:41:47.10
ability to be able to do that. So when you moved to Oregon, you got your new husbands there,

443
00:41:47.10 --> 00:41:52.06
and you're all kind of like living a pretty normal life. I mean, it sounds like you got three kids,

444
00:41:52.06 --> 00:41:57.26
you got your husband, he's doing long haul trucking, you got a decent job. So it's relatively stable?

445
00:41:59.18 --> 00:42:06.06
Relatively. Yeah, I mean, it was probably the most stable that my kids had known.

446
00:42:06.06 --> 00:42:13.66
And how long did that stability last for? I would say probably the first four years,

447
00:42:13.66 --> 00:42:18.86
maybe, of the marriage, and then started seeing some real issues. You know, there was unfaithfulness

448
00:42:18.86 --> 00:42:28.30
on his part. And then he ended up taking his life 28 years ago. So again, a lot. And like I said,

449
00:42:28.30 --> 00:42:31.90
I never tell all this all at once, but you think back through it, you know, like, oh my gosh,

450
00:42:31.90 --> 00:42:39.26
how did any of us, you know, turn out. But again, that was the healing that God's provided in my

451
00:42:39.26 --> 00:42:46.22
life and letting me know that I am valuable, that I am precious, that he loves me. And not,

452
00:42:46.22 --> 00:42:50.30
it's a growing process. I mean, none of us become a super saint overnight. And you know,

453
00:42:50.30 --> 00:42:54.94
I'm sure there are still things that I had done or still do today that he's like,

454
00:42:54.94 --> 00:43:01.42
oh, Deborah Sue, what the heck are you doing? You know, really? But I don't ever want to do

455
00:43:01.42 --> 00:43:06.62
anything purposely that would grieve him or upset him. You know, and that's why for me,

456
00:43:06.62 --> 00:43:10.06
I want to know what are those things you don't like? Okay, well, I'm not doing them then.

457
00:43:10.62 --> 00:43:14.30
You know, and not that there aren't times, like I said, that I'm sure I disappoint him. I'm not

458
00:43:14.30 --> 00:43:21.18
perfect by any means, trust me, as my kids will tell you. But that was the major turning point

459
00:43:21.18 --> 00:43:26.22
in my life. And I saw him get me through losing my husband. Like I said, it wasn't

460
00:43:27.34 --> 00:43:32.22
perfect marriage. Not that there is a perfect marriage, but we'd been married for eight years.

461
00:43:32.22 --> 00:43:36.14
You know, there are issues there. Not that I wanted the guy dead, but you know,

462
00:43:37.02 --> 00:43:42.30
so now the kids are a little old, the kids are older at this point, they're 2018 and 16.

463
00:43:42.30 --> 00:43:50.62
So, so Mark's 16 years old. And his stepdad kills himself.

464
00:43:52.30 --> 00:43:58.38
And what's that like walking through that with? I mean, because you figure Chris is 20,

465
00:43:58.94 --> 00:44:04.78
you know, your daughter's 18, like they're a little bit more mature. Mark's still 16. That's

466
00:44:05.50 --> 00:44:09.58
there's a big difference between 16 and 18. There's an even bigger difference between 16 and 20.

467
00:44:09.58 --> 00:44:13.90
Yeah. And how, how does Mark handling that?

468
00:44:13.90 --> 00:44:17.98
I think it was definitely Mark of the kids that that was the roughest to go through.

469
00:44:20.38 --> 00:44:24.78
I had homes, been homeschooling my children at that point. I'm like, I can't, I can't do this

470
00:44:24.78 --> 00:44:29.50
anymore. Going through the grief, you know, run the preschool and kindergarten and trying to homeschool

471
00:44:29.50 --> 00:44:34.30
is just too much. So we put him in the Christian school. And he came to me one day and said,

472
00:44:34.30 --> 00:44:40.22
mom, could you please homeschool me again? And my kids when they were homeschooled, we're always

473
00:44:40.22 --> 00:44:46.06
like, Oh my goodness, we just got a skull. But I think now they look back and see the blessings

474
00:44:46.06 --> 00:44:49.90
and the life lessons that you learned in the midst of that. I don't think homeschooling is for

475
00:44:49.90 --> 00:44:58.06
everybody, you know, but it, I think that that was a blessing. And so it was Mark's cry to say, I

476
00:44:58.06 --> 00:45:03.42
just want to, I just want to be home with you, mom. I want to be where it's safe, you know. And so I

477
00:45:03.42 --> 00:45:08.86
did, you know, started homeschooling again. This is before nowadays homeschooling is

478
00:45:08.86 --> 00:45:14.70
relatively a lot easier than it used to be because I homeschooled, why should I say my wife, my wife,

479
00:45:15.42 --> 00:45:24.30
and I, my wife did 80% of homeschooling, we just did it with one kid. And it's because, you know,

480
00:45:24.30 --> 00:45:35.50
well, you know, in my opinion, from what I saw, the school system was built by girl, by women,

481
00:45:35.50 --> 00:45:40.54
and it was very well suited for girls, meaning sit at the desk and like do these things. And like,

482
00:45:40.54 --> 00:45:45.66
my girls were a lot more okay with that. You got the freaking kid, the boy, they're

483
00:45:45.66 --> 00:45:50.22
antsy and jumping around and want to break stuff and build stuff. And it was a lot to be cooped

484
00:45:50.22 --> 00:45:55.10
up in there. And if my daughters, I've offered all my kids, well, hey, if you don't want to go

485
00:45:55.10 --> 00:45:59.34
to school, just tell me, we'll figure something out. But they're all like, no, which is weird.

486
00:45:59.34 --> 00:46:02.94
It's, you can't be mad at me if you're thinking, Oh, God, we'll treat you to these daughters

487
00:46:02.94 --> 00:46:05.74
different. No, I'm telling you right now, they all have the option. And if any of the girls would

488
00:46:05.74 --> 00:46:09.58
have said, Hey, I want to be homeschooled, like awesome, I wanted to homeschool, I liked them

489
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:14.78
being home more. And you want to homeschool, which in my family meant you get to homeschool,

490
00:46:14.78 --> 00:46:18.22
that means you get to get to all day, you get to surf all day, you get to leave a little bit

491
00:46:18.22 --> 00:46:25.50
of math or whatever. But that's a cool way to go. And I offered it to my daughters,

492
00:46:26.30 --> 00:46:31.10
but they didn't, they, they didn't want to do it. I mean, I tell that to my youngest daughter

493
00:46:31.10 --> 00:46:34.46
right now. I'm like, Hey, if you don't want to go to this, you know, I was like, Oh, you got homework.

494
00:46:34.46 --> 00:46:37.34
She's like, Yeah. And I go, cool, you want to do it or you just want to hang out with me? Because

495
00:46:37.34 --> 00:46:43.42
we can just do the hangout with me. That's homeschool. And she says, No. But, but yeah, but

496
00:46:44.06 --> 00:46:46.62
back in the day, you must have had to create your own curriculum and everything.

497
00:46:46.62 --> 00:46:52.06
I did. And we were, we never had much money growing up. So that wasn't an option.

498
00:46:52.86 --> 00:46:57.66
They didn't have like you can today, you know, you can sign up for online and you have teachers

499
00:46:57.66 --> 00:47:02.22
that instruct online. But we didn't have the money, even the curriculum that was available

500
00:47:02.22 --> 00:47:08.38
to go by that. So I would go to the library. I tried to pick topics for them that, you know,

501
00:47:08.38 --> 00:47:14.14
mark back then loved aviation like, awesome, that's my background. So I would make, you know,

502
00:47:14.14 --> 00:47:18.78
the spelling, the English, everything, you know, math, you know, let's figure out how much, you

503
00:47:18.78 --> 00:47:24.94
know, gallons of fuel you're going to need for and make it relatable. And so, you know, that made

504
00:47:24.94 --> 00:47:30.22
it easier to teach my daughter kind of self taught herself, you know, she would say, Okay, by the end

505
00:47:30.22 --> 00:47:34.22
of the year, I have to be through this book and I have to do that. So I got to break it down. And

506
00:47:35.66 --> 00:47:41.98
but man, you could it's such a shorter day. We would and I did try to be structured because

507
00:47:41.98 --> 00:47:47.90
it is too easy if you're not to say, We'll do that tomorrow. Let's go surfing. But we would

508
00:47:47.90 --> 00:47:53.66
school was from nine to 12. And we got everything done in that time. You know, we should not teach

509
00:47:53.66 --> 00:47:59.42
in 30 kids in the classroom, the teachers direct attention. And then they could go have jobs,

510
00:47:59.42 --> 00:48:04.38
they could go, you know, be involved in sports and athletic Mark played soccer, you know,

511
00:48:04.38 --> 00:48:09.34
at the local high school, because you could do that, you could take the extracurricular activities

512
00:48:09.34 --> 00:48:14.94
and participate in those. And so Mark played soccer at our high school. And

513
00:48:16.14 --> 00:48:21.82
when you hear about like, Okay, so Mark's, you know, his first dad, or his biological dad's not

514
00:48:21.82 --> 00:48:29.98
around his, his stepdad comes in, he kills himself, like you, you can almost formulate in your mind,

515
00:48:29.98 --> 00:48:33.42
and there's not much money and there's like stuff going on, you formulate in your mind,

516
00:48:33.42 --> 00:48:41.58
this picture of this guy who must be, you know, kind of closed down, kind of angry, kind of rough,

517
00:48:41.58 --> 00:48:48.14
and like, it's just the absolute complete opposite. And so that was just always the case,

518
00:48:48.14 --> 00:48:53.34
like from birth, because Mark lit up a room, he was always laughing, like you couldn't, you couldn't,

519
00:48:54.38 --> 00:48:59.90
you couldn't suppress his happiness. Like no matter how hard you tried, it was coming out.

520
00:48:59.90 --> 00:49:03.98
And so that was, it kind of reminds me what you're talking about, you know, when you're telling me

521
00:49:03.98 --> 00:49:09.02
that you at some point in your life were sort of felt like you needed to be meek and mild,

522
00:49:09.02 --> 00:49:15.26
I, it's hard for me to comprehend that knowing you. And then you look at kind of the burden of

523
00:49:15.26 --> 00:49:24.38
life that was put upon Mark. And it's hard to, you just can't suppress his just personality,

524
00:49:24.38 --> 00:49:30.54
he's unsuppressable. And so it was always like that. Yes, that was just who Mark was. Yeah. And

525
00:49:30.54 --> 00:49:35.98
I think, you know, you're, that's, that's who God designed you to be, you know, you can't be a

526
00:49:35.98 --> 00:49:43.98
class clown if you're, that's not in you, you know, you could drive as a back to back champion

527
00:49:43.98 --> 00:49:52.14
of class, which is no surprise at all. So who's he hanging out with who, you know, because he's

528
00:49:52.14 --> 00:49:57.18
homeschooled. So is he mostly, is he going to play sports at school? He's playing sports at school.

529
00:49:57.18 --> 00:49:59.82
What sports are you playing? Very active in our youth group. He was a soccer player.

530
00:49:59.82 --> 00:50:05.10
Just soccer? Anything else? Nope, just soccer. Came home his freshman year and he's like,

531
00:50:05.98 --> 00:50:10.38
hey, mom, I'm going to be a professional soccer player. And I'm like, and I always told my kids,

532
00:50:10.38 --> 00:50:15.02
you put your mind to it, you can do anything you put your mind to. And when he came home and told

533
00:50:15.02 --> 00:50:20.62
me that, I'm like, Ruh-roh. Mark, you've never played soccer in your life. We didn't have the

534
00:50:20.62 --> 00:50:26.38
money for them to play, you know, a little league or Pee-wee year. He literally had never played

535
00:50:26.38 --> 00:50:30.54
soccer. And because we homeschooled them, it's not like you did it in, you know, PE class.

536
00:50:31.58 --> 00:50:35.42
And I was like, oh, but this is what I've taught him. I'm like, all right, we'll get you, you know,

537
00:50:35.42 --> 00:50:43.02
enrolled in the high school at soccer. And okay, let's do this. And that was after my husband had

538
00:50:43.02 --> 00:50:47.50
passed. So there was a little bit of money to at least, you know, pay the fees and get him in the

539
00:50:47.50 --> 00:50:53.42
program. And it was his coach was our youth pastor at our church and good family friends.

540
00:50:54.22 --> 00:51:00.06
And after the funeral, or maybe even at the funeral, Chuck had said, oh, my gosh, he was probably

541
00:51:00.06 --> 00:51:06.78
the worst soccer player he'd ever seen in his life. And Mark did his freshman year, got most

542
00:51:06.78 --> 00:51:12.94
improved player granted if you're the worst soccer player in the world. You know, that you don't have

543
00:51:12.94 --> 00:51:18.46
to go too far to get most improved player. He became the youngest soccer coach that high school

544
00:51:18.46 --> 00:51:25.66
had ever had, and was in fact trying out with the Colorado Rapids, national team in out of Colorado.

545
00:51:25.66 --> 00:51:30.14
And the night before tryouts blew out his knee, had to come home and have surgery,

546
00:51:30.70 --> 00:51:36.62
Torres meniscus, Torres meniscus and his ACL had half his meniscus removed, which we had in the

547
00:51:36.62 --> 00:51:44.62
refrigerator forever. Okay, show everybody. But finally, I'm like, Mark, throw that away. Somebody's

548
00:51:44.62 --> 00:51:50.86
gonna come in and think that's something deep in there. But and even missing those parts of his body

549
00:51:50.86 --> 00:51:56.94
still became an ABCL. But it was really cool. Probably three years ago, the Colorado Rapids

550
00:51:56.94 --> 00:52:01.18
reached out to me and they said, we want to present you Mark's team jersey. We know he had made the

551
00:52:01.18 --> 00:52:06.86
team. And so got to go up there and they had fireworks for him. They showed two different videos,

552
00:52:06.86 --> 00:52:12.78
three minutes long about Mark and just honoring him. And I was like, Mark, you got your team jersey,

553
00:52:12.78 --> 00:52:20.46
buddy. So yeah, determination, definitely one of his characters. So he's going to high school,

554
00:52:20.46 --> 00:52:25.26
but he's homeschooled, you're teaching him, which means he's getting straight A's. I mean, I hope,

555
00:52:25.26 --> 00:52:30.46
right? Yeah, no, he wasn't getting straight A's. He was having a little hard time focusing at the

556
00:52:30.46 --> 00:52:36.14
time. You know, my kid got straight A's when he was over 100%. No, it was probably harder on them

557
00:52:36.14 --> 00:52:40.78
than I would have been the kids at the school that were going through. So but he's playing soccer.

558
00:52:40.78 --> 00:52:45.98
So as he's, you know, freshman year, sophomore year, junior, as he's starting to think about going

559
00:52:45.98 --> 00:52:51.66
to college. And is Christopher already in the Marine Corps? Christopher's not in the Marine

560
00:52:51.66 --> 00:52:58.06
Corps yet. But he's in living in Colorado. And then Mark had decided, yeah, he was going to go to

561
00:52:58.06 --> 00:53:04.78
college, he wanted to be a youth pastor. So he went down to the master's college, just in California,

562
00:53:04.78 --> 00:53:10.70
isn't it? Yeah, just north of LA, Santa Clarita. And how's that for him? It was good. He loved it.

563
00:53:10.70 --> 00:53:16.30
It was doing great. Playing soccer for them there. And then after his first year when he was home that

564
00:53:16.30 --> 00:53:21.10
summer, and he did construction work, oh my gosh, they would say, that guy will carry three sheets

565
00:53:21.10 --> 00:53:26.70
of plywood all by himself up the stairs. But if you know, Mark, he was he's built, you know, big guy,

566
00:53:26.70 --> 00:53:34.94
that's why he got the big gun. But yeah, so to see him, you know, do those things and and carry on

567
00:53:34.94 --> 00:53:41.74
in the term nation was pretty amazing. So he's going to college. I mean, it sounds like this is,

568
00:53:41.74 --> 00:53:45.90
as far as I'm concerned, like you raised a kid, they're now going to call the God in college,

569
00:53:45.90 --> 00:53:50.62
they're playing soccer, cause this is like a big win for you. You're, I mean, successful mom, right?

570
00:53:50.62 --> 00:53:55.90
You're, you're thinking not successful mom. But you know, I did my best. But literally,

571
00:53:55.90 --> 00:53:59.58
my kids should have been their background should somebody should have been, you know,

572
00:53:59.58 --> 00:54:04.06
killed in a drug overdose. Somebody Cheryl should have had, you know, 15 kids by the time she was

573
00:54:04.06 --> 00:54:10.62
20. And, and I didn't, I just, I was hoping if my kids got to 18 and nobody was pregnant, nobody

574
00:54:10.62 --> 00:54:15.58
is an alcoholic, we're good. Yeah. So you got a kid. That's what I'm saying. You got a kid that's

575
00:54:15.58 --> 00:54:22.30
like, yes, but again, not because of me and my skills as a parent, you know, well, I'm sorry to

576
00:54:22.30 --> 00:54:27.50
disagree with you, but you had to do something right to get these kids from a rough background.

577
00:54:28.06 --> 00:54:33.18
And here you got Mark, he's going to college, he's playing soccer. That's incredible. Like

578
00:54:33.18 --> 00:54:40.22
playing soccer or playing any athletic pursuit in college is awesome. And, and so then how's that

579
00:54:40.22 --> 00:54:45.02
going? So he's going to be a youth pastor. He's on a good moral path. Everything's going awesome.

580
00:54:45.02 --> 00:54:50.30
Yep. And then when he came home that summer, decided he was going to change his major from

581
00:54:50.30 --> 00:54:56.30
being a pastor, he now wanted to be a lawyer. And so in my warp sense of humor, I say, first he was

582
00:54:56.30 --> 00:54:59.42
going to save them, then he's going to defend them. And then he became a seal and said, I'll just kill

583
00:54:59.42 --> 00:55:08.78
them. But obviously that's a terrorist. But, and went one semester with the switch to law. Back to

584
00:55:08.78 --> 00:55:13.10
the same school. Yeah, back to the same school. And then said, you know what, I'm going to go pursue,

585
00:55:14.06 --> 00:55:17.18
you know, the Colorado Rapids and try to be a professional soccer player. So

586
00:55:17.18 --> 00:55:23.42
I think that's what maybe he went in between. Maybe that's what it was in between the first year,

587
00:55:23.42 --> 00:55:27.82
then he went play soccer and then decided when he bought his need to go do one more semester.

588
00:55:28.46 --> 00:55:32.94
And that's when I really started seeing him reading as he was recovering books about other

589
00:55:32.94 --> 00:55:37.34
Navy SEALs and what they'd gone through. Again, we, they never had swim lessons growing up.

590
00:55:37.90 --> 00:55:43.26
And we didn't have a pool. So I noticed he started going to the local community pool and

591
00:55:43.26 --> 00:55:48.62
swimming laps and reading about swimming and, you know, so was there anyone that told him about

592
00:55:48.62 --> 00:55:53.50
the SEAL teams or did he just find it somehow? Not that I know of. I don't know that we knew

593
00:55:53.50 --> 00:55:59.42
anybody or he had any of those. Every kid he'd watched, you know, a movie when he's 16 that said,

594
00:55:59.42 --> 00:56:03.42
I want to be a Navy SEAL, you know, every young boy at that age that watches it,

595
00:56:03.42 --> 00:56:07.66
thinks they're going to be a cool Navy SEAL. They get all the girls, they're going to blow things up.

596
00:56:07.66 --> 00:56:14.46
And yeah, that's job ever. Yeah. But I don't know that there was anybody or nobody, you know,

597
00:56:14.46 --> 00:56:17.74
obviously a home school, nobody came to school and talked to him about it. But

598
00:56:18.62 --> 00:56:26.78
my oldest son went in the Marines in August of 2000. My daughter's husband went in the Army in

599
00:56:26.78 --> 00:56:33.66
October of 2000. And Mark went in in May of 2001. And I'm sure being the youngest, you know, he's

600
00:56:33.66 --> 00:56:41.10
like, I'm going to one up you guys, watch this. So very competitive. But yeah, so on 9-11, all

601
00:56:41.10 --> 00:56:45.98
three of my kids' lives were involved in the military. And I could see the handwriting in the

602
00:56:45.98 --> 00:56:49.90
wall. I knew we were going to have loved ones deployed. Yeah. You know, and I remember doing

603
00:56:49.90 --> 00:56:55.58
an interview at the town we lived in was about 5,000 people. And the reporter said, you know,

604
00:56:56.14 --> 00:56:59.74
I know all your family's involved. What if someone dies? And I said, well,

605
00:56:59.74 --> 00:57:05.98
God forbid that whatever happened. But I've seen God walk me through death before. I know he would

606
00:57:05.98 --> 00:57:13.66
do it again. You know, and who knew that August 2nd, we would end up dealing with that. But so proud

607
00:57:13.66 --> 00:57:20.62
of, you know, all my kids' choice to serve in the military and to make a difference because they

608
00:57:20.62 --> 00:57:28.22
loved God. They loved our country. They knew it was the right thing to do, to stand for and protect

609
00:57:28.22 --> 00:57:35.26
this nation that we love. And I get so frustrated at times that, you know, obviously for those of us

610
00:57:35.26 --> 00:57:41.42
in the military, we understand that sacrifice and not just the sacrifice that Mark gave of his life,

611
00:57:41.98 --> 00:57:46.22
what you guys have sacrificed in your health, what the families have sacrificed for all the

612
00:57:46.22 --> 00:57:52.14
deployments that are gone with the kids, you know, not having a parent around. And it is so important

613
00:57:52.14 --> 00:57:58.54
for those civilians to recognize that sacrifice that is made so that we can live free every day.

614
00:57:59.18 --> 00:58:04.06
And when I autograph the books that I'm contributing author and I sign it, live your life worthy of

615
00:58:04.06 --> 00:58:10.38
that sacrifice. And we do owe that to all of our men and women who served to live lives honoring

616
00:58:10.38 --> 00:58:15.66
them and recognizing, you know, I don't think anybody unless they've served or close to somebody

617
00:58:15.66 --> 00:58:20.30
really completely understand that, but you need to try to understand it as much as you can. There's

618
00:58:20.30 --> 00:58:25.18
a huge price paid for the freedoms that you enjoy every day and don't ever take those for granted.

619
00:58:27.82 --> 00:58:35.66
As Mark's joining the Navy, so Christopher joins the Marine Corps, what's he doing in the Marine Corps?

620
00:58:36.70 --> 00:58:37.82
Christopher was.

621
00:58:37.82 --> 00:58:40.70
Shoot me for not remembering him in the west.

622
00:58:40.70 --> 00:58:41.74
Well, no, it's fine because I was actually.

623
00:58:41.74 --> 00:58:43.02
Communications, who's communications?

624
00:58:43.02 --> 00:58:48.54
But a lot of people that aren't in the military, they don't even, they're like, oh, you're in the

625
00:58:48.54 --> 00:58:52.30
Marine Corps. That's just like what you're doing. Like every Marine is just a Marine.

626
00:58:52.86 --> 00:58:57.26
And then, you know, oh, so you do, you, oh, you're going to the Marine Corps. Okay.

627
00:58:57.26 --> 00:59:02.06
You know, you got it. And you kind of know what a Marine is. Did you have any clue about what a

628
00:59:02.06 --> 00:59:07.98
seal was? No, I really didn't. I mean, I knew there were seals and they were special guys, but

629
00:59:07.98 --> 00:59:09.26
that was about the extent of it.

630
00:59:09.26 --> 00:59:14.46
And so when he enlisted, when Mark enlisted to be a seal, did you start doing research?

631
00:59:14.46 --> 00:59:17.42
Did you start trying to figure out what was going on? Or were you just like, okay, well,

632
00:59:17.42 --> 00:59:20.22
sounds like it's going to be hard. Good luck. Go get some. Yeah, pretty much.

633
00:59:21.50 --> 00:59:24.30
Like, I don't think my, I was talking about this yesterday with a guy. I was like,

634
00:59:24.30 --> 00:59:27.90
I don't think my parents actually understood anything that was going on. They just,

635
00:59:28.62 --> 00:59:31.42
you know, I'm like, oh, I'm going through some hard training. They're like, okay.

636
00:59:32.38 --> 00:59:36.70
Like, okay, bye. You know, who I called six months later, I made it through that hard training.

637
00:59:36.70 --> 00:59:41.74
I was talking about, okay, good job. Okay, great. You know, like there was no, there was no,

638
00:59:41.74 --> 00:59:45.66
I don't think they just comprehended. Whereas nowadays, there's so much information

639
00:59:45.66 --> 00:59:53.10
that you can really, I did watch the two, three, four video on history channel.

640
00:59:53.10 --> 00:59:59.10
So that was out. Okay. Well, no, that's, that is a pretty, there's a lot of information in that.

641
00:59:59.10 --> 01:00:04.14
And it's definitely not, you know, the way it's edited, it seems, yeah, it's an introduction

642
01:00:04.14 --> 01:00:09.74
to it. And it definitely is a nice perspective. It's in the rose colored glasses, you know,

643
01:00:09.74 --> 01:00:19.98
on seal training. Little soft. Yeah. So Mark goes and how you got what, a son-in-law in an army,

644
01:00:19.98 --> 01:00:28.46
you got a son in the Marine Corps. And so September 11th comes and you're, that is a heavy,

645
01:00:29.10 --> 01:00:32.94
that is a heavy deal for you. I mean, three for three.

646
01:00:32.94 --> 01:00:41.02
Yeah. When, how long is, where's Mark at when September 11th happens?

647
01:00:42.30 --> 01:00:46.46
So Mark was. Was he already at Bud's?

648
01:00:48.94 --> 01:00:51.50
I want to say he might have been down at his A school in Pensacola.

649
01:00:51.50 --> 01:00:56.54
Might have been at A school. So he's going to A school, which is the old way they used to do it.

650
01:00:56.54 --> 01:01:02.94
You'd go to like, you learn a regular Navy job. He was an aviation ordinance man, AO2,

651
01:01:02.94 --> 01:01:07.58
Mark Lee, coming in hot. That's before they have their own, you have your own job now in

652
01:01:07.58 --> 01:01:11.26
this heel teams. It's called an SO, special operations, special operator, something like that.

653
01:01:12.70 --> 01:01:16.46
When he went to Bud's for the first time, how's he doing? Was he ready? Were you talking to him?

654
01:01:17.02 --> 01:01:22.54
He was good. His mindset, you know, again, looking back from that side of it,

655
01:01:22.54 --> 01:01:27.74
I felt like his mindset was good. He was determined. He was going to, you know, he was going to do this.

656
01:01:29.02 --> 01:01:36.86
And he, on Thursday night of Hell Week, so just the point, he was an hour away from being rolled

657
01:01:36.86 --> 01:01:43.42
forward. They had done Med checks on him. And he had pneumonia and he had pulmonary edema. So he

658
01:01:43.42 --> 01:01:49.34
had water in the lungs and water outside the lungs. And they pulled him from training. And even then,

659
01:01:49.34 --> 01:01:54.70
he was like, no, no, I got this. I can do this. And they said, no, we lost a guy two classes go.

660
01:01:54.70 --> 01:02:01.34
Exactly. We have to pull you. And so as you can imagine, very devastated, you know, that that

661
01:02:01.34 --> 01:02:06.62
happened. He had to start all the way back in the beginning, you know, wait for the next class.

662
01:02:06.62 --> 01:02:10.54
He was picking up trash or doing something in between and, you know, very frustrated,

663
01:02:10.54 --> 01:02:17.82
but he's ready to go at it again. And then that was class 239 that he started in. Then 2400,

664
01:02:17.82 --> 01:02:22.54
he started over again and got to Hell Week and Monday night of Hell Week, he called me

665
01:02:23.58 --> 01:02:30.46
and he said, Hey, mom, I'm D.O.R.D. which dropped on request, request. He rang the bell. And I'm

666
01:02:30.46 --> 01:02:35.02
like, you know, the joastery is I'm like, yeah, whatever. I know how bad you want it. There's no

667
01:02:35.02 --> 01:02:38.70
way. Yeah. So what else is going on? He goes, mom, I'm serious to rang the bell. I'm like,

668
01:02:38.70 --> 01:02:43.34
Mark, knock it off. You know, this is not something you joke about. He's like, mom, it's Monday night

669
01:02:43.34 --> 01:02:48.86
of Hell Week. I wouldn't have privileges to call you if I was still in Hell Week. And I'm like, oh,

670
01:02:48.86 --> 01:02:55.02
I remember that from before. And of course, when you ring the bell, then you still the Navy time.

671
01:02:55.02 --> 01:02:59.58
You don't just go back home and get a new job and move on with life. Yeah. Note to anyone that's

672
01:02:59.58 --> 01:03:05.10
listening that thinks you might want to be a seal. Just remember if you don't make it, which you

673
01:03:05.10 --> 01:03:11.34
probably won't. And I know you don't think it's you. You all don't think it's you. You think that,

674
01:03:11.34 --> 01:03:15.90
oh, I'm not going to be the one that quits. Everybody thinks it's someone else. But most likely

675
01:03:15.90 --> 01:03:21.42
it's you. And I guess there's some people, I've heard some people say like, you actually know,

676
01:03:22.06 --> 01:03:26.86
like you actually know if you're going to make it or not. I don't know if that's true or not. I

677
01:03:26.86 --> 01:03:32.46
know I was going to make it. I'm not saying I was cocky. I wasn't too cocky. I was still worried.

678
01:03:32.46 --> 01:03:35.66
Like you're worried. You're like, damn, I could fail something tomorrow and that could be that.

679
01:03:35.66 --> 01:03:41.50
And so that's why you're paranoid. Even harder. I was paranoid the whole time. But I was, you know,

680
01:03:41.50 --> 01:03:44.14
I had a pretty good level of confidence. Like I know I'm not going to quit.

681
01:03:45.98 --> 01:03:52.22
So just keep that in mind. So Mark, and this is also good to remember Mark quit his first time

682
01:03:52.22 --> 01:04:00.14
through. And instead of being like, okay, well, I give up forever. He's like, okay, so how long

683
01:04:00.14 --> 01:04:03.74
when you talk to him that night, was he, what, what, what, do you have any idea what drove that

684
01:04:03.74 --> 01:04:12.14
decision? He had met a gal and fell in love. And she felt like this was not conducive to family

685
01:04:12.14 --> 01:04:17.02
life, which agreed. Okay, it's tough on family. Once again, anyone that's listening, you think

686
01:04:17.02 --> 01:04:23.66
you might want to do this job, postpone the ladies, postpone the ladies. They're not going to help

687
01:04:23.66 --> 01:04:31.02
you get through this. There's like very rarely. Yeah. So let's, let's, let's hold off on the ladies

688
01:04:31.02 --> 01:04:37.02
until you get done. Then you can go and find yourself a girl. So Mark meets a girl. And he's a

689
01:04:37.02 --> 01:04:40.94
freaking romantic dude anyways. You know what I mean? He's kind of like a Hopos romantic. And I'm

690
01:04:40.94 --> 01:04:46.62
sure that is kicking his ass to, you know, pretty good looking. Yeah. Yeah. I can't judge that

691
01:04:46.62 --> 01:04:52.14
because I'm a man, but I'm sure if you ask a bunch of women, they would make that judgment

692
01:04:52.14 --> 01:05:00.46
that he's handsome. And kind of jacked to, he's kind of jacked to, which is, which is good to be.

693
01:05:00.46 --> 01:05:05.34
So when you're talking to him, he's like, I met this girl. Did he have immediate regret? A lot of

694
01:05:05.34 --> 01:05:08.30
times people quit. They have immediate regret. Was he like, no, I think I made the right call.

695
01:05:09.02 --> 01:05:16.46
What was his attitude? Yeah, no, he was sent to Virginia Beach was signed to the USS. I always

696
01:05:16.46 --> 01:05:22.38
have to stop and think of its enterprise or Eisenhower Eisenhower. And it was in dry dock.

697
01:05:22.38 --> 01:05:27.18
So he was sent to the Army base there to drive a shuttle bus for them. I have a picture of him

698
01:05:27.18 --> 01:05:33.66
with his head on the steering wheel. Like, Oh my gosh, he's gone from being Navy SEALs now and

699
01:05:33.66 --> 01:05:40.22
picking up people on the base on this bus and, um, hate in life. He was not happy. And I remember

700
01:05:40.22 --> 01:05:45.10
him calling me and saying, mom, I screwed up. I'm like, what'd you do now? He goes, I shouldn't

701
01:05:45.10 --> 01:05:51.82
rang the bell. And I said, positive. We've prayed about this. He goes, yeah, mom, I need to go back.

702
01:05:52.38 --> 01:05:56.06
I said, then you need to get your butt back there. You need to do whatever it takes. If you're sure

703
01:05:56.06 --> 01:06:01.58
this is where you're supposed to be and where God wants you, you get to do it. And he had, it took

704
01:06:01.58 --> 01:06:08.14
him about a year. He had to do meet with officers. He had to do extra PT. He had to write essays. I

705
01:06:08.14 --> 01:06:12.70
mean, the evals and stuff and rightfully so. How did they know you've already quit once?

706
01:06:13.26 --> 01:06:17.02
You know, how do we know we get you back there and spend all this money training you and,

707
01:06:17.02 --> 01:06:22.30
and you quit again? You know, so he really had to prove himself and he did and ended up being

708
01:06:22.30 --> 01:06:27.26
and running for the honor man. I remember he called that night and he goes, mom, I didn't get honor

709
01:06:27.26 --> 01:06:35.34
man. I'm like, Mark, you got your trident, but I get it. I'm competitive, you know, but yeah.

710
01:06:35.34 --> 01:06:40.70
Did he train more or do you think it was just the mindset was there? What happened to the girl?

711
01:06:42.06 --> 01:06:46.62
By the way, she's still in his life at that time. So, you know, but he just realized this is what

712
01:06:46.62 --> 01:06:50.54
I'm supposed to do, you know, and like I told him, if you do not do him, God designed you do,

713
01:06:50.54 --> 01:06:54.30
you're going to come home and kick the dog and your wife and you're going to be fighting all

714
01:06:54.30 --> 01:06:59.10
the time or your girlfriend or, you know, you need to be where you're supposed to be. And so,

715
01:07:00.38 --> 01:07:03.98
you know, and again, they're in Virginia Beach, I'm in Arizona at this time. So,

716
01:07:03.98 --> 01:07:07.66
I didn't see a lot of that extra training. I'm sure he had to do extra training,

717
01:07:08.54 --> 01:07:13.42
you know, nor was real familiar with what was going on with their relationship at that time.

718
01:07:13.42 --> 01:07:18.06
Did he make it through? Do you know if he made it through like straight through in the second,

719
01:07:18.06 --> 01:07:22.78
the second time he went to Bud's? I think he made it straight through. I think there was one

720
01:07:25.58 --> 01:07:31.34
pool comp, maybe, where they let him do one more time. Yeah. So, I think he,

721
01:07:32.46 --> 01:07:37.26
are you giving a couple tries in pool comp? I think you definitely get more than one,

722
01:07:37.26 --> 01:07:40.62
but you get a few tries and if you don't make it, then you get rolled back a class.

723
01:07:40.62 --> 01:07:43.58
Yeah, he never got rolled back. Okay, well, then that's awesome. But he did the pool comp the first

724
01:07:43.58 --> 01:07:49.58
time and then I think did it the second. Yeah, I failed pool comp the first time. Yep, I failed

725
01:07:49.58 --> 01:07:53.58
pool comp the first time, I think. Yeah, and then I passed it my second time and I was totally

726
01:07:53.58 --> 01:07:57.74
paranoid. Yeah, but I'm already preparing my grandkids for that just in case they want to do

727
01:07:57.74 --> 01:08:03.66
that. We do drownproofing in the pool at home. So, yeah. Let's be safe. I'm safe, trust me.

728
01:08:04.46 --> 01:08:11.58
Yeah, that's impressive to get it through the first time. And again, I've had a couple people

729
01:08:11.58 --> 01:08:21.34
that I've known that had kids that went to Buds that quit and if I think that they're good kids,

730
01:08:22.14 --> 01:08:27.02
I will tell them about Mark Lee and Mikey Montsour and I'll say, yeah, you know Mark Lee and Mikey

731
01:08:27.02 --> 01:08:30.94
Montsour and they go, yeah, and I go, both of those guys quit the first time they went to Buds.

732
01:08:31.90 --> 01:08:38.70
And if you learn from this, you can go back and you can get after it and you can do awesome in

733
01:08:38.70 --> 01:08:43.66
the SEAL teams. Or if it's not for you, then just accept that and go do something else,

734
01:08:43.66 --> 01:08:48.38
which is perfectly fine. Yes. It's not a job for everyone. There's different personalities and

735
01:08:49.02 --> 01:08:52.06
there's different things. It doesn't make you a bad person if you don't make it through SEAL

736
01:08:52.06 --> 01:08:55.66
training. It just means that you weren't supposed to be a SEAL. Go be something else and do something

737
01:08:55.66 --> 01:09:01.50
else cool, which is fine. But like you said, if that's what you really think you should do,

738
01:09:02.70 --> 01:09:05.58
and I'll tell you another thing to watch out for everybody, if you're listening to this and

739
01:09:05.58 --> 01:09:11.18
you're thinking this might be the path for you, it's this is like when Mark's, this is during

740
01:09:11.18 --> 01:09:18.62
the war. There's no war going on right now. The second chances that were pretty fairly common

741
01:09:19.66 --> 01:09:23.58
are not that common right now. And if you quit right now, people are like, okay, well, you don't

742
01:09:23.58 --> 01:09:29.02
really want to be here and that's that. So if you go, don't think that there's a second chance.

743
01:09:29.02 --> 01:09:32.30
Don't go into an attitude with, don't go into it with the attitude that there's a second chance

744
01:09:32.30 --> 01:09:36.62
because likely at this current time, there's probably not going to be a second chance for you

745
01:09:37.42 --> 01:09:43.74
just because that's, there's no war going on. I mean, you're talking, this is 2004, 2005,

746
01:09:43.74 --> 01:09:50.46
like we needed SEALs. And so those slots were more open. So did you come out to graduation?

747
01:09:50.46 --> 01:09:55.98
I did. Yep. Came out to the graduation and one of my favorite pictures that I have was Mark and

748
01:09:55.98 --> 01:10:03.02
I on the O-Course after he graduated. Oh, yeah. I've seen that picture. Yeah. Love that picture.

749
01:10:03.02 --> 01:10:07.74
Yeah. He got his trident at graduation. Right? Okay. So this is the old way you didn't get your

750
01:10:07.74 --> 01:10:12.22
trident at graduation. You went to a team. So he got his trident at graduation and

751
01:10:13.26 --> 01:10:19.02
now he's going to, he gets assigned to SEAL team three, which to you, that doesn't mean anything.

752
01:10:19.02 --> 01:10:22.38
You're just like, well, SEAL team three sounds great. Now it does. Best team in the world.

753
01:10:22.38 --> 01:10:27.82
So you're like, okay, he's going to SEAL team three and how fired up is Mark at this juncture?

754
01:10:28.38 --> 01:10:32.22
He's pretty fired. Yeah. Yeah. He's, I mean, think about it. After going through

755
01:10:33.50 --> 01:10:40.06
three bloods classes, you know, you finally done it, you're successful. You know, there's a mission,

756
01:10:40.06 --> 01:10:44.70
you know, you're going to be deploying soon. You know, that's what he trained for. Yeah. He trained

757
01:10:44.70 --> 01:10:48.70
to make a difference in the world and, you know, to get rid of the evil that's out there,

758
01:10:48.70 --> 01:10:53.98
you know, for our family, for America, for everyone that lives here, you know,

759
01:10:54.54 --> 01:11:01.50
because he knew it was the right thing to do. Yeah. Sometimes people think or their perception is

760
01:11:01.50 --> 01:11:06.46
that someone will change, buds will change them. Some people have the attitude that like, no,

761
01:11:07.02 --> 01:11:11.74
they didn't change the person. They just got rid of the people that weren't that way in the first

762
01:11:11.74 --> 01:11:16.22
place. What did it look like to you with Mark? Yeah. I don't think it changed Mark. You know,

763
01:11:16.22 --> 01:11:21.18
he's always been the determination when he puts his mind, you know, talk about soccer,

764
01:11:21.18 --> 01:11:24.06
coming home saying, I'm going to be a professional soccer player. You know,

765
01:11:24.06 --> 01:11:27.66
then he followed through. It didn't just happen because he didn't do the hard work to make it

766
01:11:27.66 --> 01:11:33.02
happen. I can remember him on Saturdays, we got a ball machine that would shoot the balls at him

767
01:11:33.02 --> 01:11:38.46
so he could, you know, practice dribbling or heading in or, and he'd be out there for eight

768
01:11:38.46 --> 01:11:44.22
hours on a Saturday. What 16, 17 year old do you know that's going to be that determined

769
01:11:44.22 --> 01:11:50.86
to reach his goal by giving up his Saturdays to be able to do that? And so that's, that's who

770
01:11:50.86 --> 01:11:55.66
Mark was. I don't think it changed him. I think there's some things that might have, you know,

771
01:11:55.66 --> 01:12:00.14
habits that he developed, maybe a little bit different, but it didn't change who Mark was.

772
01:12:01.58 --> 01:12:08.14
Yeah. And again, like you can just see that he has just an unsuppressable personality of fun.

773
01:12:08.14 --> 01:12:16.86
And so yeah, that's not going to change. So when, when Mark showed up to SEAL team three,

774
01:12:17.42 --> 01:12:24.14
he actually got assigned to task unit Charlie. That's what he got assigned to.

775
01:12:24.14 --> 01:12:25.66
Is that the original one he got?

776
01:12:25.66 --> 01:12:30.06
This is the original one he got assigned to. So he got assigned to task unit Charlie. So

777
01:12:30.06 --> 01:12:34.46
I forget which platoon he was in, but he's either in Echo or Foss.

778
01:12:34.46 --> 01:12:40.14
Okay. So he's in Echo platoon at SEAL team three and we're all going through, I didn't know Mark

779
01:12:40.14 --> 01:12:43.58
at all. Then, you know, he's in a different task unit. He's a new guy in a different task unit.

780
01:12:43.58 --> 01:12:48.06
I'm in task unit bruiser, but we're, you know, we're all doing different training. So we're not

781
01:12:48.06 --> 01:12:54.78
even, even though we're at the same team, we're not, we're rarely all together, you know,

782
01:12:54.78 --> 01:12:58.46
they're at the desert, we're at the jungle, we're at the ocean, they're at the mountain. Like,

783
01:12:58.46 --> 01:13:05.66
so you, so you don't really get to know people right away in one workup for sure. And then what

784
01:13:05.66 --> 01:13:10.54
happens is task unit bruiser, there's different task units going to different parts of the world.

785
01:13:11.10 --> 01:13:16.70
And they had to send one task unit to Iraq and another task unit was going to go to the Pacific

786
01:13:16.70 --> 01:13:23.58
Theater and task unit bruiser gets chosen to go to Iraq. And when that happens, we get an

787
01:13:23.58 --> 01:13:28.46
opportunity to bring a couple more guys in from the task unit that was going to the Pacific.

788
01:13:29.26 --> 01:13:35.18
And so we got assigned a couple of guys. One of those guys is Mark and Mark shows up and,

789
01:13:35.18 --> 01:13:40.22
you know, so he shows up, he's a new guy. He had some buddies in there, you know, from that were

790
01:13:40.22 --> 01:13:45.66
other new guys and whatnot, but like, you just get a guy that's showing up and it's probably the best

791
01:13:45.66 --> 01:13:53.90
move as a new guy to a platoon or to a task unit. And our task unit was definitely, I mean, we were

792
01:13:53.90 --> 01:13:58.94
called task unit bruiser and we were, we were definitely up to your name. Yeah, we were definitely

793
01:13:58.94 --> 01:14:07.18
an aggressive group of dudes and probably the best call would have been to kind of gray man,

794
01:14:07.18 --> 01:14:12.22
you know, that expression gray man, get in there, lay low, let me just like, kind of fit into this

795
01:14:12.22 --> 01:14:18.14
gig and I'm not going to stand out and that's what I'm going to do. Not Mark. Mark was,

796
01:14:18.14 --> 01:14:24.54
Mark was freaking not like that at all. He was out of the gate like, but the weird thing was

797
01:14:25.18 --> 01:14:31.90
in the SEAL teams, the primary as a new guy in the SEAL teams, the primary role, the primary

798
01:14:31.90 --> 01:14:36.94
result of your mouth is to get you in trouble. Like anytime you open your mouth, there's a 90%

799
01:14:36.94 --> 01:14:41.18
chance you're going to get yourself into trouble. You're going to end up, you know, saying something

800
01:14:41.18 --> 01:14:44.86
you should have said, doing, you know, offending someone you shouldn't have offended. It's,

801
01:14:44.86 --> 01:14:49.26
it's probably going to get you in trouble. And so that's one of those things that makes people

802
01:14:49.26 --> 01:14:52.54
go, Hey, like, I don't need to roll the dice on this. I'm just going to keep my mouth shut.

803
01:14:53.42 --> 01:15:00.06
And Mark was just not like that. But the interesting thing was his mouth didn't get him

804
01:15:00.06 --> 01:15:04.38
into trouble. It kind of, it was like drew people through it. Yeah, drew two people and it made,

805
01:15:04.38 --> 01:15:11.02
it was, he's very endearing and had that like childish sort of fun thing where you really

806
01:15:11.02 --> 01:15:16.54
couldn't be mad at him. Like, even if he said something that normally would have made someone

807
01:15:16.54 --> 01:15:22.14
rage with anger, the way he would say it and the way he would laugh about it and the way he would

808
01:15:22.14 --> 01:15:27.18
shrug his shoulders and, you know, raise his eyebrows like, Hey, you know, as a matter of fact,

809
01:15:27.18 --> 01:15:31.18
there's a video of Mark and he's like doing something in a car. I've searched and searched

810
01:15:31.18 --> 01:15:34.78
for it. I haven't been able to find it. Have you seen the video where like Mark's in a car and he's

811
01:15:34.78 --> 01:15:40.62
like singing a song. And I don't know who's got that, but I have seen that, but it's, it's hilarious.

812
01:15:40.62 --> 01:15:44.06
It's the type of thing where you go, Yep, that's it. How could you be mad at that guy? Like,

813
01:15:44.06 --> 01:15:48.22
it doesn't matter what he's saying to you. When he's acting like that, you can't be mad at him.

814
01:15:48.22 --> 01:15:51.82
Okay. Try parenting something like that. Oh, it had to be. He must have gotten away with,

815
01:15:51.82 --> 01:15:58.62
he must have gotten away with pretty much anything because so interestingly, when he rolled in, so

816
01:15:58.62 --> 01:16:03.02
he's, so he's automatically like, I think one of the first things he said was like, I can't be choked

817
01:16:03.02 --> 01:16:07.02
out, you know, like, I can't be choked out. He's laughing and he's getting choked out. But it's

818
01:16:07.02 --> 01:16:13.66
like, no, it's mad at him. They're just laughing like it's hilarious. One of our, so, so we're

819
01:16:13.66 --> 01:16:19.90
done with our pre deployment training. So now we're in our sort of, like we're doing sort of

820
01:16:19.90 --> 01:16:25.82
specialized training that we want to focus on. And we end up doing this trip where we go to

821
01:16:25.82 --> 01:16:32.54
Hawthorne, Nevada, and we go to Nellis Air Force Base, which what this means is Nellis Air Force

822
01:16:32.54 --> 01:16:39.42
Base is just outside of Las Vegas and Hawthorne is like within a short drive of Reno and Tahoe.

823
01:16:39.98 --> 01:16:44.62
So we end up getting awesome training while we're also having like an awesome time,

824
01:16:44.62 --> 01:16:50.06
pre deployment, we're ready to rock and roll. And this is where, when we're, and this is where,

825
01:16:50.06 --> 01:16:58.14
you know, we really started to see Mark and what he was like. We end up, and I don't know,

826
01:16:58.14 --> 01:17:04.38
I don't know if there's a, what is it? What's the word for like when you can't get in trouble for

827
01:17:04.38 --> 01:17:10.14
anything anymore? Like a diplomatic immunity? Not diplomatic. It's when too much time has passed.

828
01:17:10.14 --> 01:17:15.02
Oh, statute of limitations. So I don't know if there's a statute of limitations on stuff on,

829
01:17:15.02 --> 01:17:21.10
on kids say there is. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna swim more past it. But here we are. This is

830
01:17:21.10 --> 01:17:27.50
where we're a SEAL task unit and we're going to train in these two places. We end up in Vegas.

831
01:17:27.50 --> 01:17:31.82
And while we're in Vegas, instead of staying like on the base that's up there, we stay,

832
01:17:31.82 --> 01:17:39.10
we get like a wing of a casino. We have, we're there and we're training hard. But then at night,

833
01:17:39.10 --> 01:17:44.70
we're coming back and it's like, we got casinos, we got booze and clubs and all this stuff. And this

834
01:17:44.70 --> 01:17:50.70
is where really like Mark is just on fire. We've got an audience. Oh, he's got an audience. He's

835
01:17:50.70 --> 01:17:54.14
like living the dream. And of course, when you're a young SEAL, you're the richest person in the

836
01:17:54.14 --> 01:17:58.94
world. You got more money than you ever know what to do with. And there's some classic Mark Lee

837
01:17:58.94 --> 01:18:05.02
lines, which number one playing blackjack, like we're all sitting around the blackjack play

838
01:18:05.58 --> 01:18:11.74
table and playing. And every time the dealer would bust, Mark would just be like, everybody's a

839
01:18:11.74 --> 01:18:17.74
winner. And he's got everyone saying this. And it's like embarrassing the freaking dealer and

840
01:18:17.74 --> 01:18:22.14
they're causing all kinds of like legitimately like pit bosses are coming over. They're like

841
01:18:22.14 --> 01:18:28.38
checking him out. Like what's going on here. Then like one time they're, they're, they bring in

842
01:18:28.38 --> 01:18:35.18
other dealers, like they want to cool down the table, like they bring in a cooler and Mark would

843
01:18:35.18 --> 01:18:39.18
be like, Oh, they think they're bringing in the ice man. They think they're gonna cool me down.

844
01:18:39.18 --> 01:18:42.94
They're gonna cool me down. You can't do it. He's like talking this just immense amount of shit to

845
01:18:42.94 --> 01:18:50.62
these, to these, to these dealers. And he's just a freaking maniac. I remember I like come down to

846
01:18:50.62 --> 01:18:55.58
the casino floor and I'm looking like across and I see Mark and he's at a blackjack table and he's

847
01:18:55.58 --> 01:19:00.94
like, Hey, sir, this is like a public place. Hey, sir, sir. And I look over and I'm like, what's up?

848
01:19:00.94 --> 01:19:06.38
And he goes, Hey, when are the new Cadillacs coming out? I mean, he's just going nuts, like

849
01:19:06.38 --> 01:19:11.66
uncontrollable mayhem. Right. And this is, this is what you're dealing with with Mark. It's just

850
01:19:11.66 --> 01:19:17.90
like this unstoppable, unsuppressable attitude doesn't just doesn't care what anyone's thinking.

851
01:19:17.90 --> 01:19:26.46
He's just having a freaking blast. And actually, this is, this is when I found out that Mark was

852
01:19:26.46 --> 01:19:31.58
married. Well, you found out before we did. I know. And so what happened wasn't so I didn't know

853
01:19:31.58 --> 01:19:36.30
he's married, right? And like, we're, we're at, we're sitting there playing blackjack and like,

854
01:19:36.30 --> 01:19:39.26
it's, we're, you know, guys are starting to peel off and like, Hey, we're going to the club because

855
01:19:39.26 --> 01:19:43.42
they're putting most of the guys are single. I'm not single. So I'm playing blackjack. And so finally,

856
01:19:43.42 --> 01:19:47.90
I'm like expecting Mark to get up and go, you know, I'm like, Hey, man, what are you going to the

857
01:19:47.90 --> 01:19:50.22
club with those guys? What are you doing? You're going to roll out, you know, you're going to go

858
01:19:50.22 --> 01:19:54.86
chase the girls or whatever. Like, that's what these guys are doing. And he's like, he kind of

859
01:19:54.86 --> 01:20:00.78
like gets a little quiet, which was weird. He's like, Hey, I'm actually, I'm actually married.

860
01:20:00.78 --> 01:20:04.86
And I was like, What? He's like, Yeah, he's like, Yeah, I'm going to get, you know, we're going to

861
01:20:04.86 --> 01:20:09.42
do the real thing when I get back. But like, I got an awesome girl and he was totally stoked.

862
01:20:09.42 --> 01:20:17.26
And that was that, you know, so he was definitely, he was unofficially married at that time to Maya.

863
01:20:17.26 --> 01:20:23.18
And he was definitely in love with her like ridiculous. And that's why he was just content

864
01:20:23.18 --> 01:20:27.50
to hang out with the old guy, which was me at whatever I was 34 or something like that,

865
01:20:27.50 --> 01:20:31.50
like the oldest guy in the world. And he was content just to hang out with me and

866
01:20:33.74 --> 01:20:41.98
waste our money gambling, which again, and the Cadillac relates to the Charlie patch.

867
01:20:41.98 --> 01:20:46.94
Yeah. And that's the emblem on there is the Cadillac emblem. So yeah, that was part of the

868
01:20:46.94 --> 01:20:51.50
connection to the team too. But I'm thinking, you know, hey, they should give me a Cadillac, right?

869
01:20:52.62 --> 01:20:56.38
Yeah, they still use that SEAL team three Charlie team still uses that Cadillac

870
01:20:56.38 --> 01:21:02.14
symbol, which has, I think it came from actually the platoon before as the guys that started using it.

871
01:21:04.62 --> 01:21:10.14
So that was that was what it was like. That was the mayhem up there. And this was this was Mark

872
01:21:10.14 --> 01:21:16.86
just literally 24 hours a day. Yeah, you know, because we're going out training and he what's

873
01:21:16.86 --> 01:21:23.26
he doing? He's just, you know, fired up laughing, poking fun of everybody, you know, just doing

874
01:21:23.26 --> 01:21:28.30
like whatever random athletic because he's a really awesome athlete. So whatever random like

875
01:21:28.30 --> 01:21:34.54
athletic thing to try and do, he's doing it throwing rocks at the target, you know,

876
01:21:34.54 --> 01:21:39.90
jumping off this thing, whatever, he's just sideways on any poles, yeah, just just do that.

877
01:21:39.90 --> 01:21:45.58
The stop signs are just just it's just 24 hours a day. Like that's what he's doing.

878
01:21:47.18 --> 01:21:51.66
But you guys did try to, you know, the new guys come to the platoon and you guys try to make it

879
01:21:51.66 --> 01:21:56.62
terrible for them. And then I heard that they tried to do that mark. And after a couple of days,

880
01:21:56.62 --> 01:22:00.78
you're like, Oh my gosh, we love this guy. We can't we can't do this. Yeah, that you took bets on

881
01:22:01.34 --> 01:22:06.86
how long you carry the gun with no sling, the big gun. Yeah, well, that that's what I was trying to

882
01:22:06.86 --> 01:22:11.66
get across. Like most guys, when they get into a platoon, they're just going to be like, Okay,

883
01:22:11.66 --> 01:22:17.10
look, I just need to be a gray man. And yeah, you're right. Like the teeth, the guys in the platoon,

884
01:22:17.10 --> 01:22:22.22
the more senior guys, it's just for you're just fresh meat. And they're just sharks looking for

885
01:22:22.22 --> 01:22:25.50
a little bit of weakness. And then they're going to rip your part. And, you know, whatever is

886
01:22:25.50 --> 01:22:29.66
going to bother you, they're going to figure out what's going to bother you. But whatever little

887
01:22:29.66 --> 01:22:34.62
name they can call you or whatever thing they can do to you flick your ear or hide your gear or call

888
01:22:34.62 --> 01:22:39.18
you a name or poke you, whatever it is that they can do that they figure out is going to make you

889
01:22:39.18 --> 01:22:44.70
mad. They're going to just harp on that thing and make your life miserable. So yes, 100%. That's

890
01:22:44.70 --> 01:22:51.10
what's happening. And they just can't find a chink in the armor of Mark like no matter

891
01:22:51.10 --> 01:22:55.50
whatever he does that stupid, he's laughing harder to himself than anyone else laughing at him.

892
01:22:55.50 --> 01:23:03.34
Like the knock knock joke. Exactly. So it's just, it's just mayhem. And, and yeah, and he's a really

893
01:23:03.34 --> 01:23:09.10
he's a stud athlete. So you know, he's carrying his, his A dub, his machine gun with no sling and

894
01:23:09.10 --> 01:23:12.46
people are like, Yeah, you're going to need that. It's like, Oh, no, I'm actually a, I'm actually

895
01:23:12.46 --> 01:23:18.06
a badass. I got this. Oh, you're a badass. Yeah. Watch this. And there you go. And he's going to

896
01:23:18.06 --> 01:23:22.94
carry that pig with, with, with no sling. And that's, that's how he's rolling. And that's how

897
01:23:22.94 --> 01:23:31.10
he always rolled. So that's what we're doing. We actually, then we do our, our, we finish that kind

898
01:23:31.10 --> 01:23:35.10
of that those little blocks of training that we're running ourselves, we're, we're getting honed,

899
01:23:35.10 --> 01:23:39.66
you know, we're doing, we are doing a lot of legitimate hard training. We're putting all the

900
01:23:39.66 --> 01:23:44.30
junior guys in charge so that they have better understanding of the leadership roles there.

901
01:23:44.30 --> 01:23:48.70
We're doing a lot of standard operating procedures. We're really drilling those. So we are doing a

902
01:23:48.70 --> 01:23:54.94
lot of work while we're having this much fun. We finish up with those train, those little blocks

903
01:23:54.94 --> 01:24:00.94
of training. We do our operational readiness exercise, which is like a big training exercise

904
01:24:00.94 --> 01:24:05.74
where they have all kinds of cool training assets. And we're out in the middle of the desert. We're

905
01:24:05.74 --> 01:24:12.22
on the army base for Irwin, which is the huge national training center for the army. And they

906
01:24:12.22 --> 01:24:17.74
have, you know, entire infantry brigades out there that are doing their training. So that means

907
01:24:17.74 --> 01:24:23.34
we're doing interoperability with tanks and soldiers. And it's just, it's just really awesome.

908
01:24:23.34 --> 01:24:28.54
We, we had some great training missions up there. And then we're going on deployment.

909
01:24:29.10 --> 01:24:34.70
And for deployment, we were supposed to be going to Baghdad and downtown Baghdad, there was a,

910
01:24:34.70 --> 01:24:40.78
there was a group of SEALs and special forces guys that had been working with the most elite

911
01:24:40.78 --> 01:24:47.66
of the Iraqi forces, which was called the Iraqi counter terror group, ICT, Iraqi counter

912
01:24:47.66 --> 01:24:53.90
terror force, ICTF. And these guys had like American weapons and American night vision. So

913
01:24:53.90 --> 01:24:58.06
these guys were really highly trained. And that's what, what we were mission was supposed to be.

914
01:24:58.06 --> 01:25:03.90
That was our mission was supposed to be. I actually went on pre deployment site survey

915
01:25:03.90 --> 01:25:07.98
to go over there and worked with them a little bit, just to get to know, meet the people,

916
01:25:08.62 --> 01:25:15.02
come back with some, you know, lessons learned and get ready for the deployment. And we were on

917
01:25:15.90 --> 01:25:20.86
pre deployment leave. So guys are on pre, I'm on a pre deployment leave, but the,

918
01:25:20.86 --> 01:25:25.34
everyone's on pre deployment leave. And I get called in by the CEO, the commanding officer.

919
01:25:25.34 --> 01:25:33.58
And he says, Hey, we're going to consolidate all of our SEAL team in the West and I'll

920
01:25:33.58 --> 01:25:39.50
um, bar province. And that means instead of you going to Baghdad, we're thinking of sending you

921
01:25:39.50 --> 01:25:48.54
to Ramadi. And at this point, everybody knew how bad Ramadi was. And I knew that that's where

922
01:25:48.54 --> 01:25:54.78
everybody in tasking bruiser wanted to go. I didn't let on that with the skipper. I played it

923
01:25:54.78 --> 01:25:59.50
like, well, geez, sir, that's a really, uh, that's an extreme change. I might need some extra gear

924
01:25:59.50 --> 01:26:05.90
and I might need some extra people. I worked it. I worked it with the skipper and he, you know,

925
01:26:05.90 --> 01:26:09.98
gave me some good stuff and, and that's what we did. We ended up, we ended up going out there.

926
01:26:11.98 --> 01:26:19.66
And I don't think, I don't think Mark, I don't think we even told the guys because they were

927
01:26:19.66 --> 01:26:25.42
on pre-deployment leave. There's no means of transmitting classified information to them.

928
01:26:26.14 --> 01:26:31.34
And, and so I don't think, I don't think we even told anybody until everyone came back from

929
01:26:31.34 --> 01:26:35.50
pre-deployment leave and we just brought everyone in like, Hey, we're, we're not going to Baghdad

930
01:26:35.50 --> 01:26:39.98
anymore. We're going to Ramadi. So I don't know, did you know where he was going? I knew that he

931
01:26:39.98 --> 01:26:44.14
was going to Ramadi, but I don't remember now that you mentioned that because he came home

932
01:26:44.14 --> 01:26:50.06
before he deployed and his birthday's in March and it was, you guys deployed, I think the end

933
01:26:50.06 --> 01:26:55.02
of March, beginning of April. And so he was there for his birthday and I had taken him to, we're

934
01:26:55.02 --> 01:26:59.02
just down the street from where the Rangers, Rangers and the Royals do their spring training.

935
01:26:59.02 --> 01:27:04.78
And so I'd taken him to a baseball game and had after the, well, seven, three, eight, then on the

936
01:27:04.78 --> 01:27:10.78
marker board, they put happy 28th birthday, have a safe deployment, love you mom. And, you know,

937
01:27:10.78 --> 01:27:14.38
in the game, I'm like, Hey, Mark, Mark, look, look, and he's just, you know, nonchalantly

938
01:27:14.38 --> 01:27:19.74
drinking his beer and acting like, okay, whatever, no big deal. But the guy said when he got back

939
01:27:19.74 --> 01:27:27.50
and he was all like, kiss what my mom did for me. But I remember when he was getting ready to leave

940
01:27:27.50 --> 01:27:33.02
and pulling away Maya came with him. And as they were pulling away, I looked at my older son and

941
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:37.82
I said, man, I don't feel good about this. And I am not a warrior or a fretter. That is just not

942
01:27:37.82 --> 01:27:42.78
my personality. And Christopher is the same way. And he looked at me and said, neither do I mom.

943
01:27:42.78 --> 01:27:48.38
And it's not like every day that a black car pulled up on my street that I'd be like, Oh,

944
01:27:48.38 --> 01:27:52.78
my gosh, it's today the day. I mean, I prayed more for Mark than anything I've ever prayed for

945
01:27:52.78 --> 01:27:57.82
in my life. But at some point, I did know he was going to Ramadi. And I've been watching the news.

946
01:27:57.82 --> 01:28:02.46
I knew Ramadi was, you know, as you guys say, the hellhole of Iraq or the worst piece of real

947
01:28:02.46 --> 01:28:09.10
estate over there. But I really, you know, knew that it was in God's hands, whatever the outcome was.

948
01:28:10.54 --> 01:28:15.98
But I think we all felt like you guys were invincible. You're trained well, you've got great

949
01:28:15.98 --> 01:28:22.14
equipment, you know, you're gonna be fine, you're gonna be good to go. You know, I think we had lost,

950
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:27.18
you know, now looking back at it, you know, Operation Red Wing was just the year before.

951
01:28:27.18 --> 01:28:32.70
And I think in the community, we felt like we paid our dues, you know, we paid the price,

952
01:28:32.70 --> 01:28:37.34
we're good to go, and nothing's gonna happen for a while. And so I think when we lost Mark,

953
01:28:37.34 --> 01:28:41.58
I think it was definitely a wake up call in the community, go home and we are still

954
01:28:42.30 --> 01:28:48.46
invisible. There are still going to be, you know, a cost here. But I don't remember if it was at

955
01:28:49.02 --> 01:28:52.54
that point, I think you're right. I don't think he knew that he just knew he was going to Iraq.

956
01:28:52.54 --> 01:28:56.86
And I think he may have called me before he deployed and say, I'm going to Ramadi.

957
01:28:59.42 --> 01:29:04.30
Once we were on the ground, like how often were you talking to Mark?

958
01:29:05.66 --> 01:29:11.50
I would say I probably talked to him at least once a week, maybe.

959
01:29:11.50 --> 01:29:16.06
Did you, what did you think about, what did you know about what was going on there?

960
01:29:16.06 --> 01:29:20.86
Oh, he was training the Iraqis. They weren't doing anything real dangerous. He was just

961
01:29:20.86 --> 01:29:25.18
training the Iraqis. And I don't, we had a couple of conversations and I'm like, well,

962
01:29:25.90 --> 01:29:30.86
so what the heck's taking so long? You keep training them for months. I mean,

963
01:29:30.86 --> 01:29:35.34
you're just teaching them to shoot and how to, you know, maneuver and do things. And he's like,

964
01:29:35.34 --> 01:29:39.58
mom, they don't even know the left hand from the right hand. I'm like, wait, what? You know,

965
01:29:39.58 --> 01:29:43.42
I had a preschool in kindergarten. That's one of the first things you teach these kids, you know,

966
01:29:43.42 --> 01:29:51.42
L for left and your hand makes the L. And I'm like, I can't even comprehend, you know. And so

967
01:29:51.42 --> 01:29:58.38
then the reality of the language barrier and just some of their customs and, but I think he, you

968
01:29:58.38 --> 01:30:04.38
know, pretty well protected us to really know the extent of, you know, he'd say I'm going out on a

969
01:30:04.38 --> 01:30:10.70
mission, but, you know, and I know at one point he did say that, you know, the numbers that you

970
01:30:10.70 --> 01:30:17.58
guys were, you were at from your missions, which is way more than other, you know, SEAL teams had

971
01:30:17.58 --> 01:30:23.98
been doing for the number of missions, but I don't think I completely understood. I obviously knew

972
01:30:23.98 --> 01:30:27.66
he was in a very dangerous place. I was watching all the casualties come in every day.

973
01:30:28.62 --> 01:30:36.30
I know it's weird for me because when we got back, like I had friends tell me, I wasn't thinking

974
01:30:36.30 --> 01:30:42.30
about this, but like guys in the SEAL teams, they were reading the after actions reports that would

975
01:30:42.30 --> 01:30:47.82
come out every day and it'd be like, oh, this engage this many gunfight here. And they were just

976
01:30:47.82 --> 01:30:53.18
super fired up. They were like, we knew you guys were freaking out after they were like, they would

977
01:30:53.18 --> 01:30:57.74
read them at the morning meeting, like everyone sit down, like read them aloud. And I was like,

978
01:30:57.74 --> 01:31:00.38
damn, like, we didn't think about that. We were over there. We're just over there. Like, hey,

979
01:31:00.38 --> 01:31:04.06
we're submitting these. I'm going to even think about where these things were going. But then I

980
01:31:04.06 --> 01:31:11.82
know that on the news and it was a weird thing on the news because there wasn't there was very few

981
01:31:11.82 --> 01:31:17.10
reporters out there in Ramadi, very few reporters. Like when I was in Baghdad, there's a reporter.

982
01:31:17.10 --> 01:31:22.06
Like you could couldn't. What is the expression swing a dead cat without hanging a reporter?

983
01:31:22.06 --> 01:31:27.42
You could there was a lot of reporters. It's okay. I'm not a cat lover. So that's okay. There was a

984
01:31:27.42 --> 01:31:33.42
lot of reporters. But in Ramadi, there was very few reporters. And so who where does the news come

985
01:31:33.42 --> 01:31:37.82
from? It comes from reporters. So when there's not a lot of reporters, there's not a lot of information.

986
01:31:37.82 --> 01:31:43.34
Now, the casualty reports were would come in regularly and they would say

987
01:31:44.30 --> 01:31:48.54
two Marines killed in our province. That's what they would say. They wouldn't usually say

988
01:31:48.54 --> 01:31:53.50
in the city of Ramadi again, because there's no one there that's really hyping the story

989
01:31:54.14 --> 01:32:02.06
of what was going on in Ramadi. And so it was it was, I think it would have been hard to

990
01:32:02.06 --> 01:32:10.46
really understand what was going on without without actually either if they had him, you know,

991
01:32:10.46 --> 01:32:14.06
reporters that were there that were that were actually putting out work because there were some

992
01:32:14.06 --> 01:32:22.06
reporters there that were reporting, but they were on small like small platforms. And so it

993
01:32:22.06 --> 01:32:28.30
wasn't like this wasn't not wasn't on Fox. It wasn't like boom, boom, boom. They're like the stars and

994
01:32:28.30 --> 01:32:32.70
stripes had some people that were out there. And so they would actually catch some stories.

995
01:32:33.58 --> 01:32:43.34
But it was definitely a challenge to to figure out what was going on. And that and outside of,

996
01:32:43.34 --> 01:32:47.34
like I said, my friends and the SEAL teams that would be bro, we were reading your AERs every

997
01:32:47.34 --> 01:32:52.62
morning at quarters. I was like, that's freaking awesome. But outside of that, I mean, my parents

998
01:32:52.62 --> 01:32:59.98
had my parents had no my wife had pretty limited idea. And actually, I've read the emails that I

999
01:32:59.98 --> 01:33:04.06
wrote to my wife during this deployment. And they're like, Hey, you know, I'm like, Hey, how's

1000
01:33:04.06 --> 01:33:08.94
everything? You know, how are the kids? Like there's literally almost nothing about the actual

1001
01:33:08.94 --> 01:33:13.98
deployment itself, which is kind of a bummer, because I would want it now to see what was going

1002
01:33:13.98 --> 01:33:21.90
on. But they're all just very bland. But that's what as you know, now, I mean, that was that's

1003
01:33:21.90 --> 01:33:28.14
what we were doing. That's what Mark was doing. And Mark was doing just an outstanding job

1004
01:33:29.50 --> 01:33:33.58
across the board. And one thing I know you've heard a little bit about this, but you know,

1005
01:33:34.94 --> 01:33:41.26
we were working with Iraqis. And some of my guys had a really hard time forming relationships with

1006
01:33:41.26 --> 01:33:46.54
Iraqis. And Mark did an awesome job of that. I know you know, he they played soccer, there's a

1007
01:33:46.54 --> 01:33:52.46
soccer stadium in downtown Ramadi, a big giant soccer stadium. And not that we used it. We used

1008
01:33:52.46 --> 01:34:00.46
it for a different purpose. But Iraqis love to play soccer. And so here was Mark, you know,

1009
01:34:00.46 --> 01:34:06.70
of an actual skilled soccer player. And most what we didn't ever have, I don't think there had been

1010
01:34:06.70 --> 01:34:12.46
skilled soccer players there before from America. And so all of a sudden, we had like a championship

1011
01:34:12.46 --> 01:34:20.14
team based about based around one guy based just around based just around Mark being a bad ass and

1012
01:34:20.14 --> 01:34:26.46
being a bad ass soccer player and being able to beat them in the game that they would usually,

1013
01:34:27.02 --> 01:34:31.90
you know, pulverize you guys. The Americans, you know, they didn't ever want to play American

1014
01:34:31.90 --> 01:34:36.86
football. Echo Charles, they never want to play baseball. They wanted to play soccer.

1015
01:34:36.86 --> 01:34:42.14
Well, and I did hear that there is a football field somewhere in Ramadi that was named after Mark

1016
01:34:42.14 --> 01:34:47.74
that he had made such an impression on those that they played with in course, you know, because

1017
01:34:47.74 --> 01:34:52.06
you guys had won several of them, they're like, we want to rematch. I said, well, that rematch is

1018
01:34:52.06 --> 01:34:58.14
going to have to happen in heaven. But yeah, even then, you know, the my first trip over to Iraq,

1019
01:34:58.14 --> 01:35:03.10
I got to meet the interpreter that was with you guys who had been sick that day and didn't go out

1020
01:35:03.10 --> 01:35:07.66
on that mission. And of course, he felt like that was his fault that we lost Mark that if he could

1021
01:35:07.66 --> 01:35:12.54
have been there, you know, he could have saved Mark and like I've told so many others, there was

1022
01:35:12.54 --> 01:35:17.98
somebody bigger in control that day, you know, that not that God caused Mark's death at all.

1023
01:35:18.70 --> 01:35:23.58
But he could have stopped it and he chose not to. And I think we're blessed 16 and a half years later

1024
01:35:23.58 --> 01:35:29.42
to see the impact Mark's still making today. And the lives he is still saving his teammates' lives,

1025
01:35:29.42 --> 01:35:34.54
you know, we were in an event yesterday that was a funeral for one of our guys. And

1026
01:35:34.54 --> 01:35:39.10
just as I kept meeting people thinking, oh my gosh, this is someone else that, you know,

1027
01:35:39.10 --> 01:35:42.54
we've helped through the foundation that wouldn't have happened if it wouldn't have been for the

1028
01:35:42.54 --> 01:35:50.06
sacrifice that Mark chose to make, you know. And, you know, soccer field and Ramadi, you know,

1029
01:35:50.06 --> 01:35:56.54
tradeup building, you know, that was named after Mark on the base, you know, movies, books, you

1030
01:35:56.54 --> 01:36:01.26
know, and I know we've been up to Mark's grave before and I said, man, that's the hardest thing

1031
01:36:01.26 --> 01:36:06.62
to see your kid's name on a headstone. You know, that's not normal. That's not the way

1032
01:36:07.42 --> 01:36:13.02
life should be. We should be living, you know, full lives and dying in our old age. But when we

1033
01:36:13.02 --> 01:36:18.94
have heroes who did what Mark did and what you guys did, their stories need to be told. People need

1034
01:36:18.94 --> 01:36:24.54
to understand the sacrifices that are made and who these guys are, what their character is.

1035
01:36:25.18 --> 01:36:29.98
You know, you guys are some of the toughest warriors that we have in America. And I'll tell

1036
01:36:29.98 --> 01:36:35.18
you what, some of the most kind, compassionate, caring man I've ever known. And how God gets

1037
01:36:35.18 --> 01:36:42.30
that mixture together in your body is, it's absolutely amazing. So, yeah.

1038
01:36:42.30 --> 01:36:50.06
Yeah. And I think that's what made Mark so amazing is he had the extreme of both those facets.

1039
01:36:52.22 --> 01:36:59.18
You know, like we're talking about, I moved talking about how insuppressable his personality

1040
01:36:59.18 --> 01:37:09.26
was from a just fun and humor side. But like on the on the warfighting side, we mentioned, you

1041
01:37:09.26 --> 01:37:13.90
know, he's out there. He's a machine gunner. He's carrying his machine gun with no sling.

1042
01:37:15.26 --> 01:37:24.54
He's a lead turret gunner in the vehicles, which night after night, you know, in Vietnam,

1043
01:37:24.54 --> 01:37:30.30
in the Vietnam war, the point man is the most vulnerable guy because you're walking through a

1044
01:37:30.30 --> 01:37:35.50
jungle and you're having to break trail. And as you break trail, guess what? You might hit

1045
01:37:36.14 --> 01:37:39.26
tripwire. You might walk into an ambush and you're going to get killed.

1046
01:37:40.30 --> 01:37:44.78
And so what they did in Vietnam was they rotate that guy out. They go, okay, you do it for,

1047
01:37:45.82 --> 01:37:49.82
you know, an hour, then we're going to get another guy up there for an hour because you can't handle

1048
01:37:49.82 --> 01:38:00.86
that much vulnerability as a human. Well, in Ramadi, the lead turret gunner in a vehicle,

1049
01:38:02.62 --> 01:38:08.62
he's the most exposed guy because he's up out of the vehicle on his machine on his 50 caliber

1050
01:38:08.62 --> 01:38:17.02
machine gun. And the primary threat in Ramadi is roadside bombs. And so when you hit a roadside

1051
01:38:17.02 --> 01:38:22.38
bomb with a convoy, it's a person in the lead vehicle that's in the turret that's going to most

1052
01:38:22.38 --> 01:38:32.86
likely be killed or be gravely wounded. And the horrible decision that someone made in Ramadi

1053
01:38:32.86 --> 01:38:39.58
was to put the vehicle, what we call the vehicle graveyard, which is 75 or 100 vehicles that have

1054
01:38:39.58 --> 01:38:44.94
been blown up in Ramadi. And when they drag them back to base, they would just put them on into

1055
01:38:44.94 --> 01:38:52.54
this field. And you every time you left base, you would see 100 of these mangled vehicles,

1056
01:38:52.54 --> 01:38:58.38
burned out vehicles, and every one of those vehicles, you know that there was one, two, three, four

1057
01:38:59.26 --> 01:39:04.62
military US military personnel that were wounded or burned or killed inside those vehicles. And

1058
01:39:04.62 --> 01:39:12.14
that's what you got to see. And so Mark going out night after night, lead vehicle, lead turret

1059
01:39:12.14 --> 01:39:19.10
gunner, never, never said, Hey, you know, can I go in the second vehicle? Can I go in the third

1060
01:39:19.10 --> 01:39:25.02
vehicle? Can I go in the back? Never one time, just lead vehicle every time. Just taking just

1061
01:39:25.02 --> 01:39:31.50
taking the all the odds and just saying, I got it, boys, don't worry about me. And you know, I

1062
01:39:31.50 --> 01:39:35.74
would, you know, if I wasn't going out or not, I, you know, as the vehicles were lined up, I'd go

1063
01:39:35.74 --> 01:39:39.18
out like, you know, make sure everyone's good to go. I'd give them a little hand salute as they were

1064
01:39:39.18 --> 01:39:45.02
rolling out. And I was like, it was mar, it had to been marked 38th mission in a row of being in

1065
01:39:45.02 --> 01:39:51.10
the lead vehicle. And I'm looking up at him and he's looking down at me and I'm like, Hey, bro,

1066
01:39:51.66 --> 01:39:57.10
you feeling good? How you feeling? He's like, I'm feeling lucky, sir. Let's go. Like that was his

1067
01:39:57.10 --> 01:40:05.26
attitude. Big smile. And it's a big smile. A big giant smile on his face. As he's getting ready

1068
01:40:05.26 --> 01:40:11.18
for the 39th 40 47th time in a row to go out and go down those roads where

1069
01:40:12.30 --> 01:40:19.10
the main road route Michigan in Ramadi had seven to 10 roadside bombs detonated on it a day.

1070
01:40:21.10 --> 01:40:25.98
A day. And that's what he's rolling out to. And he's laughing. And he's smiling.

1071
01:40:25.98 --> 01:40:36.70
But I think part of that was he was secure. He knew if anything happened,

1072
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:40.70
not that he wanted something to happen, but he knew if anything happened, he knew he was going.

1073
01:40:41.50 --> 01:40:45.58
He knew when he got to heaven, there's no pain, no sorrow, no sickness. You know,

1074
01:40:45.58 --> 01:40:50.06
lots of times I've thought about him up there in his onriness. I'm sure God's maybe sometimes going,

1075
01:40:50.06 --> 01:40:56.22
oh boy, maybe we should send it back. But he's making heaven exciting. That's for sure. Not

1076
01:40:56.22 --> 01:41:05.50
that it might have been exciting before, but he had that confidence. He knew that it wasn't over

1077
01:41:05.50 --> 01:41:12.38
for him. It might be over for him here on earth, but he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt where he's

1078
01:41:12.38 --> 01:41:18.46
going. And oftentimes, people tell me, oh, yeah, Mark's in Vahala, warrior's heaven,

1079
01:41:18.46 --> 01:41:24.70
you know, because of what he did for his country. I'm like, okay, well, I would probably die from

1080
01:41:24.70 --> 01:41:29.34
my country if it was needed, but I'm not going to be at a place probably where that's going to be

1081
01:41:29.34 --> 01:41:38.70
required to me. But he knew. He knew 100%. You know, and for me, then, what's that mean for me?

1082
01:41:38.70 --> 01:41:43.18
How do I get to heaven if I got to die for my country? No, Mark's in heaven because he knew

1083
01:41:43.18 --> 01:41:48.06
Jesus Christ was his Lord and Savior in the story, you know? It's not based on what we do

1084
01:41:48.06 --> 01:41:53.34
or what we don't do or what we say or what we don't say, you know? Christ already paid that price

1085
01:41:53.34 --> 01:41:58.38
for us and Mark knew that beat on to shadow of a doubt. And so I think that was the smile on his

1086
01:41:58.38 --> 01:42:03.02
face. He wasn't scared, you know? He may have had fear and had that courage to push through it,

1087
01:42:03.58 --> 01:42:13.58
but he knew the end of the story. Yeah. After seeing a lot of guys in a lot of tough situations,

1088
01:42:13.58 --> 01:42:21.98
to not be able to really pick up an ounce of like hesitation from a guy is very rare.

1089
01:42:23.10 --> 01:42:29.66
It's very rare. And so he definitely knew because you're going to show something. Yeah. And he didn't

1090
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:41.90
have any fear, which is incredible. So this is now like we're getting, we've been on deployment.

1091
01:42:41.90 --> 01:42:47.18
Did you know, did you know Cowie came home? Did you even aware of that? No. No. So you're...

1092
01:42:47.18 --> 01:42:52.86
I really did not know a lot about the team. I had met Bobby Gasoff, who was just swim buddy at,

1093
01:42:52.86 --> 01:42:58.30
and I think Maddie Long, who was on three, but not on Charlie Petun or Taskin Ruzer.

1094
01:42:58.86 --> 01:43:03.58
I met them briefly at graduation, but I didn't know any of the other guys, didn't know anything

1095
01:43:03.58 --> 01:43:08.06
about really what was going on. Well, you know, obviously what I know now is what I've learned

1096
01:43:08.06 --> 01:43:15.42
afterwards. But yeah. Yeah. So you're kind of tracking. And again, to me, it always, and I kind

1097
01:43:15.42 --> 01:43:22.38
of relate it to my family, because my family is my wife, just not knowing what's going on. Like,

1098
01:43:22.38 --> 01:43:26.38
she's just, and I don't, I think in a lot of ways she just didn't even want to know. She's like,

1099
01:43:26.38 --> 01:43:31.26
Hey, you go do your thing. I do my thing. You take care of it. And same thing with my like,

1100
01:43:31.26 --> 01:43:36.38
my kids, they were young at the time. So they were just, you know, I was just dad. He's not here.

1101
01:43:36.38 --> 01:43:40.86
Where is he? Yeah, I don't know. But he's not here. He'll be home in a little while. My parents,

1102
01:43:40.86 --> 01:43:44.70
just I'd been in the Navy my whole, you know, adult life. They were just used to me going on

1103
01:43:44.70 --> 01:43:49.66
appointment. They wouldn't hear from me for a month or two. And then I'd, yep, everything's cool.

1104
01:43:49.66 --> 01:43:54.06
So I think that sounds like that's where you were at too. Like, Hey, sounds on deployment.

1105
01:43:54.06 --> 01:44:04.94
They're, that's me. I'll be back. Let's track it. You got an email in July, like a group email

1106
01:44:05.74 --> 01:44:14.22
from Mark just before July 4th. Just after him. And I want to read this email.

1107
01:44:14.22 --> 01:44:24.86
Mark says this glory is something that some men chase and others find themselves stumbling upon

1108
01:44:25.42 --> 01:44:32.22
not expecting it to find them either way. It is a noble gesture that one finds bestowed upon them.

1109
01:44:32.22 --> 01:44:39.34
My question is, when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade or an unjustified

1110
01:44:39.34 --> 01:44:49.42
means by which consumes one completely? I've seen war. I've seen death, the sorrow that

1111
01:44:49.42 --> 01:44:57.50
encompasses your entire being as a man breathes his last. I can only pray and hope that none of

1112
01:44:57.50 --> 01:45:03.90
you will ever have to experience some of the things I have seen and felt here. I have felt fear.

1113
01:45:03.90 --> 01:45:09.34
And if felt adrenaline pump through my veins, making me seem invincible, I will be honest and say

1114
01:45:09.34 --> 01:45:15.18
that some of the things I've seen here are unjustified and uncalled for. However, for the most

1115
01:45:15.18 --> 01:45:22.22
part, we are helping this country. It will take more years than most expect, but we will get Iraq

1116
01:45:22.22 --> 01:45:30.46
to stand on its own feet. Most of what I've seen here will never, I will never really mention or

1117
01:45:30.46 --> 01:45:37.34
speak of only due to the nature of those involved. I've seen a man give his food to a hungry child

1118
01:45:37.34 --> 01:45:43.66
and family. Today, I saw a hospital that most of us would refuse to receive treatment from.

1119
01:45:44.94 --> 01:45:50.94
The filth and smell would allow most of us to not be able to stand to enter, let alone get medicine

1120
01:45:50.94 --> 01:45:57.02
from. However, you will be relieved to know that Coalition Forces has started to provide security

1121
01:45:57.02 --> 01:46:05.02
for and supply medicine and equipment to help aid in the cause. I've seen amazing things happen here.

1122
01:46:06.14 --> 01:46:12.30
However, I've seen the sad part of war too. I've seen the morals of a man who cares nothing

1123
01:46:12.30 --> 01:46:18.06
of human life. I've seen hate towards a nation's people who has never committed a wrong, except

1124
01:46:18.06 --> 01:46:25.26
being born of a third world, ill-educated and ignorant to Western civilization. It is not

1125
01:46:25.26 --> 01:46:31.66
everybody who feels this way, only a select few, but it brings questions to mind. Is it okay for one

1126
01:46:31.66 --> 01:46:39.58
to consider themselves superior to another race? Surprisingly, we are not a stranger to this

1127
01:46:39.58 --> 01:46:45.10
sort of attitude, meaning that in our own country, we discriminate against someone for what nationality

1128
01:46:45.10 --> 01:46:52.30
they are, their education level, their social status. We distinguish our role models as multimillion

1129
01:46:52.30 --> 01:46:58.46
dollar sports heroes or talented actors and actresses who complain about not getting millions of

1130
01:46:58.46 --> 01:47:05.42
dollars more than they are currently getting paid. Our country is a great country. Don't get me wrong

1131
01:47:05.42 --> 01:47:12.54
on this, otherwise none of us would be living there. My point of this is how can we come over here

1132
01:47:12.54 --> 01:47:18.38
and help a less than fortunate country without holding contempt or hate towards them if we can't

1133
01:47:18.38 --> 01:47:27.26
do it in our country? I try to do my part over here, but the truth is over there in the United States,

1134
01:47:27.26 --> 01:47:38.38
I do nothing but take. Ask yourself, when was the last time you donated clothes that you hadn't worn out?

1135
01:47:38.38 --> 01:47:46.38
When was the last time you paid for a random stranger's cup of coffee, meal, or even maybe a tank of gas?

1136
01:47:46.38 --> 01:47:53.42
When was the last time you helped a person with the groceries into or out of their car?

1137
01:47:53.42 --> 01:47:59.42
Think to yourself and wonder what it would feel like if when the bill for the meal came and you

1138
01:47:59.42 --> 01:48:06.78
were told it was already paid for. More random acts of kindness like this would change our country

1139
01:48:06.78 --> 01:48:14.22
and our reputation as a country. It is not unknown to most of us that the rest of the world looks at

1140
01:48:14.22 --> 01:48:21.18
us without towards our humanity and morals. I am not here to preach or to say look at me

1141
01:48:22.54 --> 01:48:31.18
because I am just as at fault as the next person. I find that being here makes me realize the great

1142
01:48:31.18 --> 01:48:38.30
country we have and the obligation we have to keep it that way. The fourth has just come and gone

1143
01:48:38.30 --> 01:48:45.90
and I received many emails thanking me for helping America great, keep America great and free.

1144
01:48:47.82 --> 01:48:53.98
I take no credit for the career path I have chosen. I can only give it to those of you

1145
01:48:53.98 --> 01:49:02.38
who are reading this because each one of you has contributed to me and who I am. However,

1146
01:49:02.38 --> 01:49:09.26
what I do over here is only a small percent of what keeps our country great. I think the truth

1147
01:49:09.26 --> 01:49:19.90
to our greatness is each other. Purity, morals and kindness pass down to each generation through

1148
01:49:19.90 --> 01:49:28.38
example. So to all my family and friends, do me a favor and pass on the kindness, the love,

1149
01:49:28.38 --> 01:49:34.22
the precious gift of human life to each other so that when your children come into contact with a

1150
01:49:34.22 --> 01:49:39.42
great conflict that we are now faced with here in Iraq, that they are people of humanity,

1151
01:49:40.30 --> 01:49:51.98
of pure motives, of compassion. This is our real part to keep America free. Happy fourth, love you,

1152
01:49:51.98 --> 01:50:01.50
love you, Mark Lee, PS halfway through the deployment. Can't wait to see all of your faces.

1153
01:50:01.50 --> 01:50:21.18
Was that an indicator of some of the heaviness that was happening with Mark?

1154
01:50:21.18 --> 01:50:31.10
Yeah, I think very much so. You listen to that letter and you see the transformation

1155
01:50:31.66 --> 01:50:39.66
that happened for Mark, what he saw over there, what he endured. The humbleness, the reality to say,

1156
01:50:39.66 --> 01:50:43.50
oh my gosh, I'm not any different than the rest of you. When I was there, all I did was take.

1157
01:50:43.50 --> 01:50:52.62
You know, he realized the blessings that we do have and I've never been able to get

1158
01:50:52.62 --> 01:50:55.98
through that letter without getting choked up at the end where he says halfway through the

1159
01:50:55.98 --> 01:51:02.30
deployment. Can't wait to see your faces. And I know one day I'll see him again

1160
01:51:03.98 --> 01:51:09.18
and he successfully completed his mission. He did what he was supposed to do over there.

1161
01:51:09.18 --> 01:51:14.86
But for us, we're halfway through the deployment. There's still something we're here and we're

1162
01:51:14.86 --> 01:51:20.30
supposed to do. And that was Mark's challenge. But there's, I mean, we could do a whole podcast

1163
01:51:20.30 --> 01:51:25.02
on dissecting just that letter apart and what he talks in there. Talks about the country and the

1164
01:51:25.02 --> 01:51:29.74
great country we have and the obligation we have to keep it that way. And you see so many people

1165
01:51:29.74 --> 01:51:34.94
coming into our country and trying to change it into something else. You see people, I sent Colin

1166
01:51:34.94 --> 01:51:41.18
Kavernick in that letter when he wouldn't stand for the national anthem or for the flag. And I was

1167
01:51:41.18 --> 01:51:47.50
like, yeah, it was the national anthem at the flag. But I said, you know, Colin, my son even

1168
01:51:47.50 --> 01:51:51.90
talked about you in his last letter home, you know, multi-million-dollar sports figures,

1169
01:51:51.90 --> 01:51:59.18
complain. And I said, Mark stood. He didn't kneel. He didn't sit. He stood for what he believed in

1170
01:51:59.18 --> 01:52:05.58
this country. You know, you need to stand for what you believe in here. If you want to make a difference,

1171
01:52:05.58 --> 01:52:09.18
go do something to make a difference. Of course, we never saw him impact anything there.

1172
01:52:09.74 --> 01:52:14.94
I'm like that red stripe on that flag that represents my son's blood, you will not disrespect

1173
01:52:14.94 --> 01:52:20.46
that. And so many others have given so much. You know, he talks about the random acts of kindness.

1174
01:52:21.02 --> 01:52:25.98
You know, that's kind of how the foundation, you know, not officially, but that's how I started

1175
01:52:25.98 --> 01:52:30.70
doing those things. On or Mark, I could pay for a stranger's cup of coffee. I could pay for a meal,

1176
01:52:30.70 --> 01:52:36.62
tank of gas back then wasn't as expensive as it is now, but I could do those things. I understood

1177
01:52:37.58 --> 01:52:41.50
the price that was being paid and the sacrifices that were made for me. That's a pretty simple

1178
01:52:41.50 --> 01:52:46.86
thing to go up and say, hey, I'm going to buy your coffee. Thank you. You know, let me buy your tank

1179
01:52:46.86 --> 01:52:52.86
of gas. Let me buy your meal. You know, it talks about opening a door for, you know, someone or

1180
01:52:52.86 --> 01:52:57.26
helping them with their groceries, enter out of their car. What's happened to America that we've

1181
01:52:57.26 --> 01:53:03.82
gotten so far away from that? You know, and to end that with to my family and friends, do me a favor.

1182
01:53:05.10 --> 01:53:13.58
Pass on the kindness, the love, the precious gift of human life. We understand that precious gift and

1183
01:53:13.58 --> 01:53:19.66
how quickly it can be gone. But holy cow is America. What's happened to us? Why can't we

1184
01:53:19.66 --> 01:53:23.66
pass on that kindness? We can have different opinions. That's what you guys fought for so we

1185
01:53:23.66 --> 01:53:27.98
get out of those different opinions. But that doesn't mean you need to be so mean and hateful

1186
01:53:28.62 --> 01:53:34.46
to people. And I just really think some of those things, basically, if we did those as humans that

1187
01:53:34.46 --> 01:53:40.86
Mark challenged us to do, we'd be living in a different world. And you know, when I first got

1188
01:53:40.86 --> 01:53:46.54
that, like I said, it came as an email. It was about two weeks before he died. And it wasn't

1189
01:53:46.54 --> 01:53:52.30
supposed to be that if you're reading this, I'm gone. And I read through it on the computer and

1190
01:53:52.30 --> 01:53:58.78
I was like, who wrote this? And you know, Mark was not stupid by any means, but language, I had not

1191
01:53:58.78 --> 01:54:04.46
seen that as a strength or you know, his forte. And so I scroll back to the top to see who sent

1192
01:54:04.46 --> 01:54:09.66
the email. I'm like, dang, you know, that was Mark. And you just feel the changes

1193
01:54:09.66 --> 01:54:20.70
that took place in not just his mind and his heart. And after he passed, man, who then that

1194
01:54:20.70 --> 01:54:28.78
letter was even more significant, the meaning of that and the impact and literally, Jaco, I don't

1195
01:54:29.34 --> 01:54:35.10
millions and millions of lives have been changed by Mark. I never would have thought when I held

1196
01:54:35.10 --> 01:54:40.22
him as a little baby in the midst all those struggles. Like I said, I didn't have high goals

1197
01:54:40.22 --> 01:54:46.54
for him. Nobody's pregnant. Nobody's now calling. Nobody's drug addict at 18. I'm good. And to see

1198
01:54:46.54 --> 01:54:54.70
that, but that came through the struggles that came through the perseverance of what we went through.

1199
01:54:56.70 --> 01:55:02.78
And those are the things that mold us and shape us, you know, and what he saw over there.

1200
01:55:02.78 --> 01:55:08.06
You know, he's talking about Saddam about, you know, the man who cares nothing, you know, about moral life.

1201
01:55:08.06 --> 01:55:15.50
And on my first trip over, I was at Biop, which is in Baghdad, which is the main base there for you guys.

1202
01:55:15.50 --> 01:55:23.10
And there's a lot of Saddam's palaces. And the one of the palaces there was where he would have his way,

1203
01:55:23.10 --> 01:55:26.78
you know, with a virgin, and then he either behead them or throw them off the balcony.

1204
01:55:26.78 --> 01:55:33.66
And then he'd put a heart on the lattice to remember them by. I'm like, what kind of sick person does something like that?

1205
01:55:34.78 --> 01:55:40.78
You know, and obviously he didn't care about human life. He had no morals, you know, he put all the waterways

1206
01:55:40.78 --> 01:55:46.78
around his palaces because he figured that, you know, Allah wouldn't be able to see his sin if he, you know,

1207
01:55:46.78 --> 01:55:50.78
put the water around him like, well, you don't think your God's big enough to look right down at what you're doing.

1208
01:55:50.78 --> 01:55:54.78
But there's some evil, evil stuff in this world.

1209
01:55:54.78 --> 01:56:04.78
And that we've got men like Mark, men like you, so many others that are willing to confront that evil that most of us in America have never even seen.

1210
01:56:04.78 --> 01:56:08.78
Or hopefully never will see. Mark talks about that, you know?

1211
01:56:08.78 --> 01:56:14.78
And it's just amazing, you know, you talked about his humor and who he was.

1212
01:56:14.78 --> 01:56:22.78
Yeah, what a caring, compassionate, and his words, words of wisdom, what a great man he is.

1213
01:56:22.78 --> 01:56:26.78
His words, words of wisdom way beyond his 28 years.

1214
01:56:26.78 --> 01:56:30.78
Most of us takes a lifetime to get that.

1215
01:56:30.78 --> 01:56:35.78
You know, I just, I would encourage everybody that's listening to go to our website.

1216
01:56:35.78 --> 01:56:39.78
You can read that on our website at americasmightywarriors.org.

1217
01:56:39.78 --> 01:56:42.78
Powerful, powerful letter.

1218
01:56:42.78 --> 01:56:52.78
Um, August 2nd.

1219
01:56:52.78 --> 01:56:58.78
And this is what I kind of covered in the opening of this podcast.

1220
01:56:58.78 --> 01:57:02.78
You know, the guys are out, they're doing a clearance.

1221
01:57:02.78 --> 01:57:10.78
This is, this was just the daily basis doing big clearances, supporting big big clearances.

1222
01:57:10.78 --> 01:57:18.78
Ryan gets wounded and, you know, it seemed like Ryan may die.

1223
01:57:18.78 --> 01:57:24.78
He was, I mean, he shot in the face. I mean, it's horrible.

1224
01:57:24.78 --> 01:57:33.78
When that happens, you know, it's on a rooftop and it's a single shot boom.

1225
01:57:33.78 --> 01:57:46.78
And what does Mark do? Mark steps right into where Ryan was to lay down suppressive fire so the guys can get to, so the corpsman can get up there and get Ryan to cover and start getting it worked on.

1226
01:57:46.78 --> 01:57:51.78
So like out of the gate, this is just what, this is what Mark is doing.

1227
01:57:51.78 --> 01:57:59.78
Um, they get Ryan evacuated. And again, I'm talking to Laph and Laph was not optimistic.

1228
01:57:59.78 --> 01:58:06.78
And they, they go back to combat outpost Falcon.

1229
01:58:06.78 --> 01:58:13.78
And this is, this is Laph and Laph's platoon. This is truck doing so it's Laph. It's BTF Tony, Chris Kyle, Kevin Lace is there.

1230
01:58:13.78 --> 01:58:16.78
Jason Hogan. I mean, there's a bunch of other guys, obviously.

1231
01:58:16.78 --> 01:58:27.78
Um, but a bunch of great guys, they're all, you know, they're obviously, they're worried about Ryan and everything.

1232
01:58:27.78 --> 01:58:38.78
And when this happens with Ryan and these guys go back to combat outpost Falcon, um, you know, the army goes out and they go, they start going hard.

1233
01:58:38.78 --> 01:58:49.78
And it's Mike Baima and the, he's the company commander from the one three seven from the bandits and they go out and they start meeting really fierce resistance.

1234
01:58:49.78 --> 01:59:03.78
And they eventually find some buildings like where they think they've got the enemy. Um, they ask Laph like, Hey, can you, can you guys come out and hit some of these buildings?

1235
01:59:03.78 --> 01:59:11.78
And that's when Laph called me and he's like, Hey, the Iraqis aren't going. The Iraqis are too scared. We're going. I'm like Roger.

1236
01:59:11.78 --> 01:59:19.78
Um, you know, this is again, this is what I read in the beginning. I'm watching the Bradleys go out.

1237
01:59:19.78 --> 01:59:33.78
Um, seeing them hit the first, uh, buildings and then they moved to this other building and actually one of, uh, the assistant platoon commanders, great guy under Laph.

1238
01:59:33.78 --> 01:59:43.78
I remember talking to him and he, like as they pull up to the second building, there's, they're in a Bradley fighting vehicle and there's rounds hitting the Bradley fighting vehicle.

1239
01:59:43.78 --> 01:59:54.78
And, and this assistant platoon commander is trying to yell to the tank, to the Bradley crew, don't open the door.

1240
01:59:54.78 --> 02:00:01.78
He's like trying to get their attention and it's too loud and they just open the door. And so then what do you do? You go. And that's what they did.

1241
02:00:01.78 --> 02:00:08.78
Um, and, you know, it opened. They assaulted the building.

1242
02:00:08.78 --> 02:00:24.78
Um, once they're in the building, you know, there's, there's stairs going up. They're taking fire and, and Mark, instead of taking cover instead of hiding, he, he steps out into the line of fire to protect his brothers.

1243
02:00:24.78 --> 02:00:46.78
And, you know, he's killed. Um, this is all taking place the morning of August 2nd in Iraq. So back here, it's 11 hours ahead in Iraq.

1244
02:00:46.78 --> 02:00:56.78
So it's probably late at night here. Um, you're, you're probably at least going to bed or you're getting ready to go to bed and going to sleep.

1245
02:00:56.78 --> 02:01:03.78
What are you doing? What were you doing on August 2nd when you wake up in the morning? What, what's going on?

1246
02:01:03.78 --> 02:01:14.78
There's a, I know that from our perspective, I mentioned that, you know, when someone gets killed, you immediately stop all communications because the, the,

1247
02:01:14.78 --> 02:01:21.78
they want the notification process to take place and you don't want to get to the news. You don't definitely don't want someone, some family member to be watching the news.

1248
02:01:21.78 --> 02:01:27.78
So it's a race. What are you doing on August 2nd?

1249
02:01:27.78 --> 02:01:36.78
I don't remember when I woke up that morning, what I was doing, but I know that there was, and I know Mark had changed the paperwork.

1250
02:01:36.78 --> 02:01:47.78
I had moved from Oregon where I raised them pretty much down to Arizona and I know he'd called and got the new address and new information as he was updating his paperwork before he left.

1251
02:01:47.78 --> 02:01:53.78
But for whatever reason, they were trying to find me up in Oregon where I'd lived.

1252
02:01:53.78 --> 02:02:02.78
And, you know, we send in the SEAL community, we send our own KACO group up there. So that group was up in Oregon.

1253
02:02:02.78 --> 02:02:07.78
And the building, you know, where I lived, I still own, but there wasn't, it was empty.

1254
02:02:07.78 --> 02:02:12.78
And they had been there for about eight hours trying to find, finally they knocked on one of the neighbors.

1255
02:02:12.78 --> 02:02:16.78
They said, well, she doesn't live here anymore. She lives down in Arizona.

1256
02:02:16.78 --> 02:02:23.78
So this is the evening by that point. And like you said, they're afraid I'm going to find out on the news.

1257
02:02:23.78 --> 02:02:33.78
So they called, Luke Air Force Base isn't too far from me, so they called there and they had a small detachment of Navy that's there and sent out the Navy KACO officer and a chaplain.

1258
02:02:33.78 --> 02:02:38.78
And I was gone that night. I was actually at my Bible study at my small group.

1259
02:02:38.78 --> 02:02:44.78
And they waited for a while and then knocked on the neighbor's door and her husband had served in the military.

1260
02:02:44.78 --> 02:02:50.78
So she kind of had a clue of what was going on. She didn't have my cell phone number, didn't know how to get a hold of me.

1261
02:02:50.78 --> 02:02:55.78
And she said, well, I know Debbie's son works at Lowe's, you know, the Lowe's just down the street.

1262
02:02:55.78 --> 02:03:00.78
So they called Christopher and again, he's served in the Marines.

1263
02:03:00.78 --> 02:03:09.78
You know, when they show up at your house, it's not good. If Margaret had been wounded, you know, they'd have got word to us and got us to him.

1264
02:03:09.78 --> 02:03:18.78
And so, oddly enough, we were celebrating my birthday that night. We hadn't met the week before, which my birthday was the Wednesday before Mark died on a Wednesday.

1265
02:03:18.78 --> 02:03:24.78
And we'd had missionaries that were there speaking to our small group.

1266
02:03:24.78 --> 02:03:34.78
And they're telling this story about Cuba and I think it was his brother-in-law and how, you know, they had been captured for being a spy or something.

1267
02:03:34.78 --> 02:03:41.78
And two guys showed up at the wife's door and knocked on the door and said, you need to grab your children and come with us if you want to see your husband again.

1268
02:03:41.78 --> 02:03:50.78
And as they go through the story, it ends up at Navy Seals. I'm like, oh, my son's a Navy Seal. You know, he's in Maudi.

1269
02:03:50.78 --> 02:03:58.78
Of course, at that point, he'd already passed. But we got done. We were celebrating my birthday and my girlfriend gave me one of those willow tree angels.

1270
02:03:58.78 --> 02:04:06.78
And those are the wooden angels with the wire wings. And each one usually has a character quality and the one she gave me was courage.

1271
02:04:06.78 --> 02:04:14.78
And this is before we found out about Mark. And she just said, with all you've been through in your life, you just remind me of such a woman of courage.

1272
02:04:14.78 --> 02:04:19.78
You still are positive. You still serve God. You're not a negative person. You're not a hateful person.

1273
02:04:19.78 --> 02:04:25.78
And little did we know how much more courage was going to be required in the next half hour.

1274
02:04:25.78 --> 02:04:32.78
And I always turned my phone off that night I hadn't. And Christopher called. Nothing in his voice to alert me.

1275
02:04:32.78 --> 02:04:36.78
He wasn't speaking too fast. He wasn't crying. He's like, hey, mom, where are you?

1276
02:04:36.78 --> 02:04:40.78
I'm like, Wednesday night, I'm at my Bible study. Why what's up?

1277
02:04:40.78 --> 02:04:45.78
And he said, how long will it take you to get home? That's an odd question.

1278
02:04:45.78 --> 02:04:49.78
I said, I don't know. Five minutes, seven minutes. Why what's up?

1279
02:04:49.78 --> 02:04:54.78
And he said, you just need to come home.

1280
02:04:54.78 --> 02:05:00.78
And I knew, I knew at that point what was going to face me when I got home.

1281
02:05:00.78 --> 02:05:05.78
And I grabbed my purse and I just told everybody, please be praying something's not right.

1282
02:05:05.78 --> 02:05:12.78
And I got my car and there was a song from my past and it says, I put my hope in you, oh Lord, trusting you, I will not be shaken.

1283
02:05:12.78 --> 02:05:18.78
Knowing that you will see me through, I put my hope in you and I just sang that over and over and over and over.

1284
02:05:18.78 --> 02:05:26.78
And I got to the main intersection by my house and there was probably three or four fire trucks and a couple police cars and ambulances.

1285
02:05:26.78 --> 02:05:30.78
And I'm like, my house blew up. That's all that's wrong.

1286
02:05:30.78 --> 02:05:34.78
And trust me, I would have rather lost all my worldly possessions.

1287
02:05:34.78 --> 02:05:40.78
It still had mark. And to this day, I have no idea how I got through that intersection, but I got back into my subdivision.

1288
02:05:40.78 --> 02:05:46.78
There are no more emergency vehicles. So I went back to, I know it's going to face me when I get home.

1289
02:05:46.78 --> 02:05:50.78
And as I turned the corner, I expected to see a black car parked there.

1290
02:05:50.78 --> 02:05:54.78
I guess I've watched too many movies, but there was no black car. There was no unusual car.

1291
02:05:54.78 --> 02:05:58.78
They'd parked down the street a ways.

1292
02:05:58.78 --> 02:06:02.78
And my oldest son, Christopher, was just pacing back and forth on the sidewalk.

1293
02:06:02.78 --> 02:06:06.78
And he said, Mom, the Navy's here.

1294
02:06:06.78 --> 02:06:16.78
And I remember just putting my head on his shoulder and crying and saying, oh, oh.

1295
02:06:16.78 --> 02:06:20.78
And we walked in the house and of course they'd been in my house for a little bit because they were trying to find me.

1296
02:06:20.78 --> 02:06:26.78
I guess I could be elusive at times. And they said, we can tell by being in your home, you're a woman of faith.

1297
02:06:26.78 --> 02:06:30.78
You need to rely on your faith for what we're about to tell you.

1298
02:06:30.78 --> 02:06:36.78
Your son, Mark Gowden Lee, has been killed in action.

1299
02:06:36.78 --> 02:06:44.78
And as you can imagine, the most devastating word you could ever hear as a parent.

1300
02:06:44.78 --> 02:06:52.78
And yet even at that moment, I knew where my strength was going to come from.

1301
02:06:52.78 --> 02:06:58.78
I knew that God was going to see me through. I knew this would be much harder than losing my husband.

1302
02:06:58.78 --> 02:07:06.78
But I knew he would see me through. And my circumstances had drastically changed that day.

1303
02:07:06.78 --> 02:07:15.78
But my God had not. He was still the same God on August 2nd as he was on August 1st. His character hadn't changed.

1304
02:07:15.78 --> 02:07:20.78
And we went and sat on the couch and I've got a skinny window next to my door,

1305
02:07:20.78 --> 02:07:23.78
did in the other house that I lived in at the time.

1306
02:07:23.78 --> 02:07:26.78
I looked outside and my friends were from my small group were all standing outside.

1307
02:07:26.78 --> 02:07:31.78
I'm like, what the heck? Get in here. I need you in here.

1308
02:07:31.78 --> 02:07:40.78
And the neighbor next door was from New York, very proper. And he's like, oh no, you don't go in there. You give them time.

1309
02:07:40.78 --> 02:07:44.78
And so they came in and we just talked about Mark and tried to process it.

1310
02:07:44.78 --> 02:07:48.78
And we cried and prayed and cried and cried.

1311
02:07:48.78 --> 02:07:54.78
They stayed for a couple hours and it was probably about 11 o'clock and everybody had left.

1312
02:07:54.78 --> 02:08:00.78
My son Christopher was still there. He served in the Marines. He was in Okinawa for five years or plus.

1313
02:08:00.78 --> 02:08:08.78
He met his wife over there and she, before they had five kids, would go home every year for six weeks.

1314
02:08:08.78 --> 02:08:16.78
And my daughter and my daughter-in-law had both just lost babies the year before at five and a half months in their pregnancy,

1315
02:08:16.78 --> 02:08:20.78
which is pretty unusually, lose a child that far along.

1316
02:08:20.78 --> 02:08:24.78
And of course our first thought was, oh no, no more lost, no more babies.

1317
02:08:24.78 --> 02:08:26.78
They were just both three months in their pregnancy.

1318
02:08:26.78 --> 02:08:30.78
And so he had decided to protect her to not tell her what was going on.

1319
02:08:30.78 --> 02:08:33.78
He knew that she'd be back home before the funeral.

1320
02:08:33.78 --> 02:08:40.78
And how he did that, struggling with probably the toughest pain he's ever known,

1321
02:08:40.78 --> 02:08:43.78
and not tell his wife and carry on conversations, is beyond me.

1322
02:08:43.78 --> 02:08:50.78
But he said, Mom, I'm going to stay here tonight. I said, thank you, son.

1323
02:08:50.78 --> 02:08:56.78
He said, I'm going to try to get some sleep. I'm like, OK, long noon, there was no way sleep was coming to me.

1324
02:08:56.78 --> 02:09:02.78
And I just wanted somebody to hold me and tell me it's going to be OK. We'll get through this.

1325
02:09:02.78 --> 02:09:07.78
At that point I'd been a widow for 12 years, and so there was nobody there.

1326
02:09:07.78 --> 02:09:13.78
And I remember thinking, OK, God's promised to be a husband of the widow and a father to the fatherless.

1327
02:09:13.78 --> 02:09:16.78
I know where my strength is going to come.

1328
02:09:16.78 --> 02:09:20.78
And so I went and grabbed my Bible and just opened it and opened to Psalms 27.

1329
02:09:20.78 --> 02:09:22.78
That's right where it plopped open.

1330
02:09:22.78 --> 02:09:26.78
It said, Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear?

1331
02:09:26.78 --> 02:09:30.78
The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?

1332
02:09:30.78 --> 02:09:37.78
When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh, my enemies and my foes, they stumbled and they fell.

1333
02:09:37.78 --> 02:09:42.78
Though an army may rise against me, I will not fear.

1334
02:09:42.78 --> 02:09:51.78
The war may come against me, and I read that going, oh my goodness, did you write this today for me for my first circumstances?

1335
02:09:51.78 --> 02:09:59.78
And the end of it says, I would have lost hope if I had not believed I'd see the goodness of the Lord and the land of the living.

1336
02:09:59.78 --> 02:10:05.78
Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage, and I will strengthen your heart.

1337
02:10:05.78 --> 02:10:09.78
Wait, I stand, Lord, and I close my Bible and I saw that courage thing again.

1338
02:10:09.78 --> 02:10:14.78
I saw that the courage angel at the beginning of the night. Now God's reminding me again, courage.

1339
02:10:14.78 --> 02:10:16.78
I'm like, I got it, Lord.

1340
02:10:16.78 --> 02:10:22.78
And as I sat there and was praying, I've never audibly heard God speak, but in my thoughts he said,

1341
02:10:22.78 --> 02:10:31.78
I want you to read this at Mark's funeral. I want you to give everybody else the same hope that I've given you.

1342
02:10:31.78 --> 02:10:35.78
As I said, I was a rebel in my 20s, and my teenagers too.

1343
02:10:35.78 --> 02:10:40.78
God says he hates seven things, and I'd done six of them. I was faithful in my marriage.

1344
02:10:40.78 --> 02:10:48.78
You can go read the rest of them. I don't want to get into all that, but I've learned that if he asked me to do something, to just obey and do it.

1345
02:10:48.78 --> 02:10:51.78
It may not make any sense. He tells us his ways are not our ways.

1346
02:10:51.78 --> 02:10:56.78
But I'm sure I kind of was like a teenager and kind of went, are you kidding me, God?

1347
02:10:56.78 --> 02:11:02.78
It's my son's funeral. I don't know if I'll throw up or pass out. I don't know what I'll do.

1348
02:11:02.78 --> 02:11:10.78
And I pause and I say, I will walk through whatever doors you open, thinking it just meant to speak at Mark's funeral.

1349
02:11:10.78 --> 02:11:15.78
I know that if God would have told me what he had in store in all the different places that I'd be,

1350
02:11:15.78 --> 02:11:20.78
at one point I spoke in front of a million people in the mall in Washington, D.C.

1351
02:11:20.78 --> 02:11:24.78
And I was terrified, terrified to speak in front of people.

1352
02:11:24.78 --> 02:11:29.78
The preschool and kindergarten, we had two programs a year, one at Christmas and one at the kindergarten graduation.

1353
02:11:29.78 --> 02:11:34.78
I would literally hold the microphone with both hands and it'd still be bouncing all over,

1354
02:11:34.78 --> 02:11:37.78
because I was terrified to be in front of people.

1355
02:11:37.78 --> 02:11:41.78
So this was not my comfort zone. This wasn't something I'm like, oh yeah, I'm such a great speaker.

1356
02:11:41.78 --> 02:11:44.78
Yeah, this would be awesome. I'm like, okay.

1357
02:11:44.78 --> 02:11:51.78
And to see what he's done and the toughest thing that I could go through in life

1358
02:11:51.78 --> 02:12:00.78
and how he's taken that, taken Mark's Royce's story to continue to impact people and change the world

1359
02:12:00.78 --> 02:12:03.78
is nothing but a miracle.

1360
02:12:03.78 --> 02:12:11.78
But again, the toughest pain I've ever known, you know, you can't avoid pain.

1361
02:12:11.78 --> 02:12:16.78
You've got to walk right through the middle of it. You can't go around it over it.

1362
02:12:16.78 --> 02:12:21.78
You can't get stuck in it because then you don't heal and you don't get to the healthier side.

1363
02:12:21.78 --> 02:12:28.78
But all the reading I've done on grief that said that's the toughest thing you could ever go through is the instant death of a child.

1364
02:12:28.78 --> 02:12:35.78
And I would have to agree with that. You know, granted, my husband wasn't the love of my life that I'd been married to for 50 years,

1365
02:12:35.78 --> 02:12:39.78
but much tougher, much tougher.

1366
02:12:39.78 --> 02:12:48.78
But so proud of Mark. I look forward to that day when I do get to see him again, give him another big hug, you know,

1367
02:12:48.78 --> 02:12:52.78
kick him in the butt and say, okay, why did you not tell us you were married?

1368
02:12:52.78 --> 02:13:00.78
But if I know anything, I know God doesn't waste pain, you know.

1369
02:13:00.78 --> 02:13:04.78
If we allow him, he will take that and use that for his glory.

1370
02:13:04.78 --> 02:13:11.78
And, you know, in his wisdom, he doesn't have in me, I'm not flying planes going, oh, well, yeah, it's just because I'm so good at this.

1371
02:13:11.78 --> 02:13:14.78
That's why it's working. It's like, no, no, you don't understand.

1372
02:13:14.78 --> 02:13:19.78
I don't have any skills or talents to be a public speaker, never taking classes on it.

1373
02:13:19.78 --> 02:13:25.78
You know, it's just going through that life experience.

1374
02:13:25.78 --> 02:13:29.78
And really, what am I going to be afraid of? Mark ran into the line of fire?

1375
02:13:29.78 --> 02:13:39.78
How many times just on his final day, I'm going to be afraid of speaking in front of people? Yeah, I don't think so.

1376
02:13:39.78 --> 02:13:50.78
The, as I mentioned in the beginning, you know, basically, as soon as we found out that you had been notified, you know, we get the word,

1377
02:13:50.78 --> 02:14:01.78
and then guys start calling, calling you to talk to you. And it's actually all happening from my, I have an office in the tactical operations center with the direct landline to America.

1378
02:14:01.78 --> 02:14:14.78
And so guys are coming in, calling from there. And again, our attitude was, we're going to have to be consoling, you know, Mark's mom.

1379
02:14:14.78 --> 02:14:23.78
And it was literally the opposite. It was literally the opposite. You know, it was my guys that needed consoling.

1380
02:14:23.78 --> 02:14:30.78
You were the one that was saying, you know, what do you need? What can I send you? What do you, how can I help you guys?

1381
02:14:30.78 --> 02:14:43.78
And I mean, so it was like this courage that you had gotten the message on you immediately put into action.

1382
02:14:43.78 --> 02:15:08.78
And then it was just for us to be able to talk to you, the guys talking to you and hearing your voice and your encouragement is what allowed guys to be able to say,

1383
02:15:08.78 --> 02:15:22.78
okay, you know, we can move forward. And, and, you know, that scene of coming out of Charlie Med and seeing all those soldiers and Marines just lined up and, you know, that's like,

1384
02:15:22.78 --> 02:15:30.78
sometimes people will attempt to bait me into saying something negative about the army of the Marine Corps and they can't do it.

1385
02:15:30.78 --> 02:15:48.78
Nothing but love for those guys. When did you, so we sent guys home, guys came home with Mark, you know, guys escorted Mark home.

1386
02:15:48.78 --> 02:15:54.78
When did you start meeting the guys from the task unit from Charlie between from task unit bruiser?

1387
02:15:54.78 --> 02:16:06.78
And it was, excuse me, I think it was the majority of you guys, it was when you came back from that deployment.

1388
02:16:06.78 --> 02:16:12.78
I yesterday were at the funeral and I was like, who spoke at Mark's funeral?

1389
02:16:12.78 --> 02:16:24.78
I'm like, how can you not remember your son's ceremony and who spoke and I remember being in another one in the same. It was at the chapel there on North Island.

1390
02:16:24.78 --> 02:16:32.78
I remember being later at another funeral there. I'm like, did we have Mark's gasket in here? I don't remember. I'm like, but I think just part of that, it's too much.

1391
02:16:32.78 --> 02:16:35.78
So you just don't remember it.

1392
02:16:35.78 --> 02:16:45.78
So I don't, I know Bobby Gasoff. At first that was his Mark's swim buddy and yeah, man, that's a pretty tight connection with your swim buddy.

1393
02:16:45.78 --> 02:16:50.78
And they weren't going to send him at first because they said, no, he's in too much pain. This is not who we send.

1394
02:16:50.78 --> 02:16:53.78
And of course now they've learned that that is.

1395
02:16:53.78 --> 02:17:07.78
And they said Commodore Pibus at the time, now Admiral Pibus was on our doorstep the next morning. And you know, Sean, you know, what a compassionate, caring man.

1396
02:17:07.78 --> 02:17:16.78
And again, I still don't even at that point didn't understand the ranks. I knew Admiral was something special, but an admiral showing up on my doorstep.

1397
02:17:16.78 --> 02:17:19.78
Granted, he was Commodore. Would he have been an admiral as a Commodore?

1398
02:17:19.78 --> 02:17:21.78
No, he was a captain.

1399
02:17:21.78 --> 02:17:28.78
I always had the hardest time with the Commodore thing. I'm like, yeah, it's like a position, not a rank position, not a rank.

1400
02:17:28.78 --> 02:17:37.78
But he was there at the door. And I remember them saying, what else can we do for you? I'm like, give me Bobby Gasoff. I want Bobby here.

1401
02:17:37.78 --> 02:17:46.78
And so they did get Bobby home. I think he might have been in the Philippines at the time he stayed with me. He and his wife stayed with us for a week.

1402
02:17:46.78 --> 02:17:53.78
But I don't even remember who the other one was. I know later that Brian Yarbo told me he was one of them that escorted Mark home.

1403
02:17:53.78 --> 02:17:56.78
And I want to say, was Jason Hogan the other one or do you remember?

1404
02:17:56.78 --> 02:18:01.78
I think so. Yeah. We sent a few, it was a few guys. It was a few guys we sent home.

1405
02:18:01.78 --> 02:18:02.78
Yeah.

1406
02:18:02.78 --> 02:18:11.78
And then obviously we sent guys home with Mike too. And when guys came home with Mikey, they were coming home like, we knew that they weren't coming back because it was the end of deployment.

1407
02:18:11.78 --> 02:18:12.78
Right.

1408
02:18:12.78 --> 02:18:21.78
I can't remember exactly which guys went with Mark and which guys went with Mikey because some of them came back.

1409
02:18:21.78 --> 02:18:31.78
Right. And it was pretty close. It was like 7, 7 1⁄2 weeks. But I think the majority of that started by phone calls and emails while you guys were still deployed.

1410
02:18:31.78 --> 02:18:41.78
You know, I remember thinking, oh my gosh, I can't make any decisions. My brain is mush. Holy cow. Those guys are in combat.

1411
02:18:41.78 --> 02:18:57.78
They've got life or death decisions they've got to make. And once I realized having Mark's brothers in our home for the week, wow, you guys love Mark as much as we did and you were hurting just as, and that's how I'm like, oh, the brotherhood thing, I got it now.

1412
02:18:57.78 --> 02:19:06.78
It makes sense. And so my concern for you guys is you're in that combat zone. You're still going out on patrol.

1413
02:19:06.78 --> 02:19:17.78
Man, how are you guys going to deal with this? How are you guys going to process and stay safe? You know, and you, you know, I think it was late for was the one I'm like, you guys go back out there.

1414
02:19:17.78 --> 02:19:26.78
You go get some, you know, don't don't hang in your rooms and, you know, Mark would want you to continue the mission.

1415
02:19:26.78 --> 02:19:36.78
But that's really when those relationships started. I got a copy of the Charlie Batoon picture and I'd say, okay, who's the one on the left? And I'd write the name down.

1416
02:19:36.78 --> 02:19:48.78
Okay, the tall guy in the middle, who's that? And of course they gave me their name names. And then they talk about Biff or I'm like, I don't have a Biff on the sheet. Who's Biff?

1417
02:19:48.78 --> 02:20:04.78
You know, and then I learned, okay, most of them have other names that they go by. But and I get phone calls even from some of the moms of the guys, you know, checking on me and I knew, I didn't know I was going to start a foundation.

1418
02:20:04.78 --> 02:20:17.78
But we had a lot of support up to the funeral. And then I live in Arizona. I'm not near a base. I'm not here, you know, San Diego or, you know, the rest of the community is or major part of it.

1419
02:20:17.78 --> 02:20:26.78
But once funerals over there, there was nothing. I mean, other than talking to you guys over there, it just, you know, it stopped.

1420
02:20:26.78 --> 02:20:36.78
And I'm like, oh, cred, well, it's just starting for me now. The process, the journey of grief is just starting. And I've never been one to feel sorry for myself.

1421
02:20:36.78 --> 02:20:46.78
I was like, okay, I can't change anything you think for myself, but I can change it so nobody else has to go through without having support there. Somebody that knows what it's like.

1422
02:20:46.78 --> 02:20:53.78
So when I got the call that Mikey had died, I knew I had to be there. I didn't know what I was going to do, but I just knew I had to be there.

1423
02:20:53.78 --> 02:21:05.78
And then that was about the time, you know, the first ones were starting to come back home. And I'm like, man, I got to be there for my boys, not to be, oh my gosh, there's poor Mark's mom.

1424
02:21:05.78 --> 02:21:10.78
But to say, woohoo, the rest of my boys are home. You know, thank you, thank you.

1425
02:21:10.78 --> 02:21:21.78
And, you know, so was here and then came over for the funeral. I remember coming over and it was the same hotel where they'd put us up for Mark's funeral.

1426
02:21:21.78 --> 02:21:29.78
Same black vehicles, I don't know, it was the exact same, but, you know, that black SUV that you guys have. And I was standing down there that morning,

1427
02:21:29.78 --> 02:21:41.78
giving, you know, Sally and the family big hugs and said, I'm so sorry. And Admiral McGuire came down and asked how I was doing.

1428
02:21:41.78 --> 02:21:48.78
So, hanging in there. And he said, we want you to go in the vehicle with the family.

1429
02:21:48.78 --> 02:21:54.78
And I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not here. This is not about Mark. This is not about me at all. I'm just here to support the family.

1430
02:21:54.78 --> 02:22:02.78
And they said, exactly, you know, and almost a panic, you know, here we got another one, you know, we thought we were good for a while.

1431
02:22:02.78 --> 02:22:09.78
And now, seven weeks later, we got another one. And he said, exactly, that's why we want you in the vehicle to support them.

1432
02:22:09.78 --> 02:22:19.78
I'm like, okay. So now I'm in the vehicle reliving, going back up to Fort Roast Cranes, same casket Mark was buried in, same place.

1433
02:22:19.78 --> 02:22:27.78
Although now, I know what it's like to get the folded flag. I know what it's to be done with the funeral and start that grieving process.

1434
02:22:27.78 --> 02:22:33.78
I'm out of just, you know, the little bit of the wound that was starting to heal was now ripping open.

1435
02:22:33.78 --> 02:22:38.78
But still, I knew it was the right thing. I knew that's what we're supposed to be to support this family, just to be there.

1436
02:22:38.78 --> 02:22:47.78
I didn't have anything planned. I didn't, you know, just to be there. And that's why I tell people all the time, when someone's grieving, just be there.

1437
02:22:47.78 --> 02:22:53.78
Don't worry about what you should say, what you shouldn't say, should I take anything, should I not take anything, just be there.

1438
02:22:53.78 --> 02:23:01.78
It means so much to have someone else there with you. If they want to talk about it, they'll probably open up and start talking about it.

1439
02:23:01.78 --> 02:23:08.78
You don't need to worry. You know, it's not like I don't remember that, you know, I had a son, Mark, and what happened to him.

1440
02:23:08.78 --> 02:23:14.78
But it's so important to be there. And that was really the first family that we supported.

1441
02:23:14.78 --> 02:23:22.78
You know, we got pretty close to the Montsour family. And, you know, Sally just passed away a couple months ago.

1442
02:23:22.78 --> 02:23:30.78
And so we were there again, you know, to be able to support and honor Mikey. But because I love that family, I understand their sacrifice.

1443
02:23:30.78 --> 02:23:37.78
And that's really what started the America's Mighty Warriors process, thinking.

1444
02:23:37.78 --> 02:23:46.78
And then I would just happen to be in Washington, D.C. when J. Redmond was there, you know, before even the note was posted on the door of, you know,

1445
02:23:46.78 --> 02:23:54.78
don't feel sorry for me. If you're coming in here to feel sorry for me, I earned these wounds doing what I, you know, love doing and don't, I don't need your sympathy.

1446
02:23:54.78 --> 02:24:03.78
I was in the hospital when Dan Knotsen was brought down from surgery. I just happened to be in Washington, D.C.

1447
02:24:03.78 --> 02:24:12.78
So these things just kept happening. That is my spiritual gift is to be an encourager and, you know, to support people.

1448
02:24:12.78 --> 02:24:18.78
And so that's where my strength, that's where I work well when I'm doing those things.

1449
02:24:18.78 --> 02:24:25.78
And then after a while, I'm like, ah, okay, I get it. I think there's a mission ahead. I don't think I'm just supposed to do this once or twice.

1450
02:24:25.78 --> 02:24:33.78
And, you know, that's when I'm like, okay, I can't continue to afford to fund this on my own dime. So we really do need to.

1451
02:24:33.78 --> 02:24:44.78
So officially we started the foundation in 2008. And the name of it, America's Mighty Warriors, the meaning of the name Mark means Mighty Warrior.

1452
02:24:44.78 --> 02:24:46.78
You know, he definitely lived up to his name.

1453
02:24:46.78 --> 02:24:49.78
Didn't you get that name from like a menu or something?

1454
02:24:49.78 --> 02:24:52.78
Great. Did Mark put that in your head to tell me that?

1455
02:24:52.78 --> 02:24:56.78
I think he told me a long time ago. He's always like, great, you got my name from a menu, mom.

1456
02:24:56.78 --> 02:24:57.78
That's what it is, right?

1457
02:24:57.78 --> 02:25:03.78
And it was. It was from a menu. As I mentioned, I'd already gone through the divorce. I was by myself here. I'm having this baby.

1458
02:25:03.78 --> 02:25:07.78
I have a three and a half year old, two year old, and now another little one.

1459
02:25:07.78 --> 02:25:15.78
Of course, back then you stayed three days in the hospital. That was common. It was rare that they let you go before that.

1460
02:25:15.78 --> 02:25:19.78
And they always ask, do you have small children and do you have help?

1461
02:25:19.78 --> 02:25:23.78
I'm like, yes, I have small children. No, I have no help.

1462
02:25:23.78 --> 02:25:30.78
And I knew that they heard two heartbeats. I knew that I knew that I knew I was having twin girls.

1463
02:25:30.78 --> 02:25:34.78
So I had names picked out for girls, but no boy names.

1464
02:25:34.78 --> 02:25:40.78
And they came in the day after he was born and said, you got to go home. We need your bed.

1465
02:25:40.78 --> 02:25:46.78
And I'm like, buh-buh, I don't have help. And I've smoked in there like, sorry.

1466
02:25:46.78 --> 02:25:49.78
So they said, you've got to name the baby before you go home.

1467
02:25:49.78 --> 02:25:53.78
And no one to discuss it with, no one to figure it out.

1468
02:25:53.78 --> 02:26:00.78
And he was born in March. I looked down at the menu for the day that was on my tray table, and the H was covered up.

1469
02:26:00.78 --> 02:26:08.78
And I saw MARC. Being a Debbie, everybody in my era, at least half the world I think was named Debbie.

1470
02:26:08.78 --> 02:26:12.78
We were trillers, ten of us. Five of us were named Debbie.

1471
02:26:12.78 --> 02:26:17.78
And you'd say Debbie and half the hall would go, huh? And I'm like, I don't want that for my kids.

1472
02:26:17.78 --> 02:26:22.78
I want them to have an individual name. But that was also in the hippie era.

1473
02:26:22.78 --> 02:26:25.78
So you were getting some really funky names that they were naming their kids.

1474
02:26:25.78 --> 02:26:28.78
And I didn't want them to have weird names.

1475
02:26:28.78 --> 02:26:31.78
Leave that to me.

1476
02:26:31.78 --> 02:26:37.78
But so when I saw MARC with a C, because back then everybody was spelling MARC with a K.

1477
02:26:37.78 --> 02:26:44.78
And I did not know at the time it meant Mighty Warrior. But that's where the name of our foundation is, America's Mighty Warriors.

1478
02:26:44.78 --> 02:26:49.78
Because it's not just about MARC. Obviously MARC's the story we tell.

1479
02:26:49.78 --> 02:26:52.78
MARC's the reason that we do what we do.

1480
02:26:52.78 --> 02:26:58.78
But it's about every man and woman who's served. It's about every other family who's lost a loved one.

1481
02:26:58.78 --> 02:27:04.78
You know, and that's been, you know, a lot of work, a lot of challenges.

1482
02:27:04.78 --> 02:27:10.78
But man, what a blessing, what a reward to be able to have that relationship.

1483
02:27:10.78 --> 02:27:13.78
I had a call from one of the other guys, a team guy that we're helping.

1484
02:27:13.78 --> 02:27:18.78
Haven't heard from him for a while. He goes, I don't know you well. It wasn't any of MARC's teammates.

1485
02:27:18.78 --> 02:27:20.78
You know, they're really close ones.

1486
02:27:20.78 --> 02:27:28.78
But there's something unique about my relationship with even ones that I first meet.

1487
02:27:28.78 --> 02:27:31.78
You know, and he said, he's having some struggles.

1488
02:27:31.78 --> 02:27:36.78
He said, you were the first one I thought of to be able to reach out to.

1489
02:27:36.78 --> 02:27:46.78
And that God has given me that blessing, that honor to be able to be there and to understand and give you guys hope and encouragement.

1490
02:27:46.78 --> 02:27:50.78
Now, I'm not going to baby you. If you think you're coming to Pomeleon.

1491
02:27:50.78 --> 02:27:55.78
I'm so sorry, poor little guy. Why don't you go lay down again?

1492
02:27:55.78 --> 02:27:58.78
No, I'm going to listen. I'm going to hear you out. I'm going to validate it.

1493
02:27:58.78 --> 02:28:02.78
Then I'm going to say, get your butt up. Here's what you need to do. You know, lovingly.

1494
02:28:02.78 --> 02:28:09.78
But you guys don't need somebody pampering a baby in you guys. That's not who you are.

1495
02:28:09.78 --> 02:28:20.78
You know, and I will do that, you know, till God gives me my final breath to be able to continue to support you guys and be there for you.

1496
02:28:20.78 --> 02:28:23.78
So you started it in 2008?

1497
02:28:23.78 --> 02:28:24.78
Officially.

1498
02:28:24.78 --> 02:28:25.78
Officially.

1499
02:28:25.78 --> 02:28:26.78
With the IRS. Yes.

1500
02:28:26.78 --> 02:28:29.78
That's when you went through all that process.

1501
02:28:29.78 --> 02:28:37.78
And then, I mean, it's September 2009 is when we lost Ryan.

1502
02:28:37.78 --> 02:28:39.78
Yeah.

1503
02:28:39.78 --> 02:28:44.78
And that was like, so unexpected.

1504
02:28:44.78 --> 02:28:50.78
And, you know, we kind of thought like you're beyond, you think you're okay.

1505
02:28:50.78 --> 02:28:51.78
You're home.

1506
02:28:51.78 --> 02:28:52.78
Yeah.

1507
02:28:52.78 --> 02:29:00.78
It's not going to happen. You're home. You're safe. Same thing with Chris. Same thing with Seth. You know, you're just like, wait, he did all those paddles.

1508
02:29:00.78 --> 02:29:06.78
Ryan survived. Like he said, well, the guy said they didn't think there was any way he could survive those wounds.

1509
02:29:06.78 --> 02:29:17.78
He did. He thrived. He didn't just survive. You know, I've got still a pound of the elk meat in my freezer that I'll never eat from the elk that he went out and shot as a blind person.

1510
02:29:17.78 --> 02:29:24.78
You know, he had, you know, just completed. I don't know if it's his bachelor's or his master's.

1511
02:29:24.78 --> 02:29:26.78
Yeah. That he just completed.

1512
02:29:26.78 --> 02:29:27.78
Got his degree.

1513
02:29:27.78 --> 02:29:28.78
You know, he called.

1514
02:29:28.78 --> 02:29:36.78
Yeah, exactly. He called. We all found this out later. Everybody's saying, guess what? I'm going to be a daddy.

1515
02:29:36.78 --> 02:29:43.78
But don't say anything because I'm not supposed to tell anybody. But he called everybody. He didn't tell everybody.

1516
02:29:43.78 --> 02:29:54.78
Yeah. And just so, so tragic. It didn't have to be, you know.

1517
02:29:54.78 --> 02:30:06.78
And then, and then it was like Chris, which again, just so out of, so totally unexpected.

1518
02:30:06.78 --> 02:30:07.78
Yeah.

1519
02:30:07.78 --> 02:30:21.78
And I know you would become really close with Chris. You know, I was, obviously, Chris being such a legendary figure and how he's portrayed all the time.

1520
02:30:21.78 --> 02:30:35.78
And, you know, whenever I'm talking to someone like, like personally talking to someone that wants to know about Chris, if I know them, you know, having a conversation with a little more depth.

1521
02:30:35.78 --> 02:30:56.78
You know, the one story I always tell people about Chris is that when at the memorial service we did for Mark in Ramadi, like, you know, guys got up and talked and, you know, read things or, you know, told little anecdotal stories about Mark.

1522
02:30:56.78 --> 02:31:09.78
And like Chris couldn't do it. And when we got done, like he was crying so hard and he was apologizing to me. He's like, I'm sorry. He was just breaking down. He just couldn't do it.

1523
02:31:09.78 --> 02:31:21.78
And that's, you know, that's, I know that it doesn't get portrayed that way. But that's, that was Chris. Like Chris just was heartbroken.

1524
02:31:21.78 --> 02:31:32.78
And I know that he had become really close with you. And yeah, then so that just was another just completely and utterly unexpected.

1525
02:31:32.78 --> 02:31:33.78
Yeah.

1526
02:31:33.78 --> 02:31:41.78
Well, and it was, I had a more physical violent reaction when I found out about Chris than I did with Mark.

1527
02:31:41.78 --> 02:31:57.78
Obviously, my pain was much more intense for Mark, my son. But I actually threw up and I was freaked out. I'm just like, and I had found out that he probably had been killed before his wife had had did.

1528
02:31:57.78 --> 02:32:04.78
And I knew I just talked to her and she didn't know. And so then I'm, you know, they're like, we're in route, we're in route, we're going to tell her.

1529
02:32:04.78 --> 02:32:18.78
But it was just like, another one. You know, and I thought about that. And I thought, this is so painful. You know, how much of this can you endure?

1530
02:32:18.78 --> 02:32:25.78
And as I thought about that, I'm like, okay, well, the other option is not to have known you guys, not to have been close to you.

1531
02:32:25.78 --> 02:32:31.78
I'm like, nope, that's not an option. This is just part of what comes along when you love people.

1532
02:32:31.78 --> 02:32:39.78
And sometimes the grief is, you know, part of that love, you know, that you cared for him.

1533
02:32:39.78 --> 02:32:45.78
And Chris and I had just been at shot show, we were trying to rebrand him. He wasn't taking any money from the book.

1534
02:32:45.78 --> 02:32:51.78
He'd started his tactical company craft. He was paying his staff, but he still wouldn't make much from them.

1535
02:32:51.78 --> 02:32:57.78
So we were trying to rebrand him, you know, so he could have some regular money coming in for him.

1536
02:32:57.78 --> 02:33:06.78
And it was an amazing time. So many great memories, you know, from those four days that we were there together.

1537
02:33:06.78 --> 02:33:17.78
And then just two weeks later, he's gone. You know, and it's just like, and again, he survived. How many deployments did he do?

1538
02:33:17.78 --> 02:33:27.78
And he'd come home and some nut job. I mean, people have tried to, in the media, portray that as the guy that shot him had PTS

1539
02:33:27.78 --> 02:33:33.78
and this was because of war. No, the guy was messed up before. He tried killing a family member as a teenager.

1540
02:33:33.78 --> 02:33:40.78
And his family to protect him didn't, you know, report that to the police.

1541
02:33:40.78 --> 02:33:48.78
And Chris, you know, Chris had a huge heart. That was where, you know, his kids went to school. The mother of the guy that killed him was, you know,

1542
02:33:48.78 --> 02:33:55.78
one of the aides in one of his kids' class. And she just said, hey, he's really struggling since he came back, you know, from his deployment.

1543
02:33:55.78 --> 02:34:03.78
Do you think you could help him? Man, I hold her culpable for not sharing the extent of that because Chris would have done something else.

1544
02:34:03.78 --> 02:34:10.78
He still would have helped him, but he'd had done something else that day. And the guy wasn't, you know, far enough gone.

1545
02:34:10.78 --> 02:34:17.78
He knew what he was doing, you know. He waited till they'd fired all their ammunition. Chris had holstered his weapon.

1546
02:34:17.78 --> 02:34:25.78
He shot Chris first and then his buddy Chad. And then he went and got a taco before he went to his sister's house.

1547
02:34:25.78 --> 02:34:36.78
I'm like, oh my gosh. So yeah. And, you know, I know we've talked about this before, Jaco, but I'm like, Chris's mom's name was Debbie.

1548
02:34:36.78 --> 02:34:45.78
My name's Debbie. Seth is mom's Debbie. So I'm like, if you're in Charlie Petunia, your mom's name's Debbie, please go tell her to change her name.

1549
02:34:45.78 --> 02:34:58.78
You know, but it's just, so much is given, you know, and yet so much was required.

1550
02:34:58.78 --> 02:35:21.78
So you obviously, you know, you and I unfortunately have been through all these things and you've been with them with with all of us and your your reaction to these things is is America's mighty orders.

1551
02:35:21.78 --> 02:35:39.78
That's what you do because you know that the pain and the loss isn't limited to us. It's there's all kinds of people that, you know, anybody that served has gone through these kind of things with a little bit more detail on America's mighty warriors.

1552
02:35:39.78 --> 02:35:56.78
Because I know what you do. I have friends that have been pulled out of the depths of hell from what you do. Can you just give us some of the high level like you got veteran advocacy.

1553
02:35:56.78 --> 02:35:58.78
So what does what does that mean?

1554
02:35:58.78 --> 02:36:01.78
So and probably that was stronger when you guys were still in combat.

1555
02:36:01.78 --> 02:36:06.78
Any issues that there were for our veterans, we're going to stand up and change this. We're going to make it right.

1556
02:36:06.78 --> 02:36:11.78
But like you've gone to DC, you've testified you have relationships with people. You can call people.

1557
02:36:11.78 --> 02:36:20.78
Yep. Got great connections there. I don't know if you remember back in, you might have been deployed then but Delta Airlines, I think it was 2008.

1558
02:36:20.78 --> 02:36:25.78
They were charging our troops coming back from the combat zone excess baggage fees.

1559
02:36:25.78 --> 02:36:36.78
And I'm like, oh, come on. No, that that can't really be true. And I've never been one just to react. I'm going to verify just because it's on the internet. Don't believe it.

1560
02:36:36.78 --> 02:36:44.78
And so I called Delta Airlines and I just said, you know, I understand that you guys are charging our service members who are coming back excess baggage fees.

1561
02:36:44.78 --> 02:36:46.78
Yes, that's our policy. That's correct.

1562
02:36:46.78 --> 02:36:55.78
I said, well, you do understand they're bringing back their weapons that they've used to defend you and your freedom.

1563
02:36:55.78 --> 02:36:59.78
You know, it's not like they went R&R and they're bringing Turkish rugs back home.

1564
02:36:59.78 --> 02:37:06.78
And she said, yes, ma'am, we understand that. I said, well, you really need to refund that money to them. Well, that's not our policy. We're not going to do that.

1565
02:37:06.78 --> 02:37:18.78
I said, well, I've got a pretty big, you know, following an outreach. If you don't refund that to them, then I'm going to let people know the details. I'm going to give them your phone numbers, your emails.

1566
02:37:18.78 --> 02:37:20.78
Just okay, fine.

1567
02:37:20.78 --> 02:37:29.78
Within 48 hours, they had reversed their decision and we're refunding the money because people were canceling their, you know, frequent flyers with Delta. They canceled their flights.

1568
02:37:29.78 --> 02:37:40.78
And obviously it wasn't just me, you know, it was the sphere of influence, you know, that God's placed around me to help do that.

1569
02:37:40.78 --> 02:37:44.78
But the one voice, one person can make a difference.

1570
02:37:44.78 --> 02:37:57.78
The other one was, and I can't ever remember who was the joint chief's staff when the ISIS flag went back up over Ramadi and man, he got on there and said,

1571
02:37:57.78 --> 02:38:06.78
there's no significance to that. And I'm like, I felt like somebody literally had sucker punched me. I'm like, are you kidding me right now?

1572
02:38:06.78 --> 02:38:13.78
My son's blood is on that soil. Don't tell me that's not significance that the enemy flags flying up there again.

1573
02:38:13.78 --> 02:38:18.78
And as we know, you know, as Ramadi goes, so goes the rest of Iraq.

1574
02:38:18.78 --> 02:38:27.78
And so again, I'm like, okay, called the Pentagon. I wanted his address. And they gave me the main address for the Pentagon. I'm like, I wasn't born yesterday.

1575
02:38:27.78 --> 02:38:35.78
He has an address where his mail goes. I'm not going to send this where you get millions of pieces of mail a day. Could I please have his address to send that to him?

1576
02:38:35.78 --> 02:38:42.78
And they said, no, here's the address. I'm like, okay, so I mailed it off. But then I sent out to my media contacts.

1577
02:38:42.78 --> 02:38:54.78
And I got a call Saturday morning from his PAO and he said, ma'am, we understand that you've demanded an apology from the joint chiefs of staff.

1578
02:38:54.78 --> 02:39:03.78
I said, yes. And I said, not just for me. It's every other man and woman who's served there. It's every other, you know, veteran who left a body part behind there.

1579
02:39:03.78 --> 02:39:11.78
It's every other family who's lost a loved one there. You should know better than anybody else how powerful your words are and what that meant.

1580
02:39:11.78 --> 02:39:16.78
He said, well, I want you to know, you know, he carries in his pocket jacket, the names of the fallen that he wrote, he sent out.

1581
02:39:16.78 --> 02:39:22.78
I'm like, great, then he's going to have no problem apologizing. And he goes, well, ma'am, that's not going to happen.

1582
02:39:22.78 --> 02:39:29.78
And again, for three days, I did, you know, national media and even CNN.

1583
02:39:29.78 --> 02:39:36.78
And they had done a great, great interview, like eight minute interview, which is pretty long when you're doing national media.

1584
02:39:36.78 --> 02:39:43.78
And I just got off Lou Dobb's show on, on Fox and was in the car coming back home.

1585
02:39:43.78 --> 02:39:52.78
And I had looked at, I think it was Facebook, I had a message because they called the office, but I wasn't there and they were trying to reach me right away.

1586
02:39:52.78 --> 02:39:56.78
And they, you know, said, please call whatever the PAO's name was.

1587
02:39:56.78 --> 02:40:04.78
And he said, we just like you to know that you will be receiving an apology letter and he wants to personally speak with you.

1588
02:40:04.78 --> 02:40:11.78
And I got home and my son Christopher and one of his buddies were there already and I was like, oh my gosh.

1589
02:40:11.78 --> 02:40:16.78
And my daughter in law being from Japan, you know, she's like, okay, so he apologized. What's the big deal?

1590
02:40:16.78 --> 02:40:22.78
And my son's like, well, he's in charge of the army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, you know, the Air Force.

1591
02:40:22.78 --> 02:40:34.78
And again, I don't ever want to be Cindy Sheehan was, you know, out there and protesting against the troops, you know, before Mark died.

1592
02:40:34.78 --> 02:40:40.78
She ended up losing her son who believed in the mission, who believed in what he was doing just like Mark did.

1593
02:40:40.78 --> 02:40:45.78
And how can you take an opposite stand to me? That's disrespectful to your loved one who gave their life.

1594
02:40:45.78 --> 02:40:49.78
You can have a different opinion, but that's not how you honor them.

1595
02:40:49.78 --> 02:40:57.78
And I never want to be, you know, like she was, I always wanted to make sure I honored and respected Mark and everything that I did.

1596
02:40:57.78 --> 02:41:06.78
And that I don't ever do anything to dishonor him or his name or his sacrifice, you know, and she was pretty wackadoodle in some of her tactics.

1597
02:41:06.78 --> 02:41:11.78
That was the Medea Benjamin and what was the code pink?

1598
02:41:11.78 --> 02:41:22.78
Well, I confronted them numerous times in DC, but, you know, just passionate about making sure that you guys get what you're entitled to, you know, rules of engagement back then were pretty bad.

1599
02:41:22.78 --> 02:41:29.78
So we worked on that. Our random acts of kindness that Mark talks about, we started with the coffee, meals, tank and gas and do those often.

1600
02:41:29.78 --> 02:41:34.78
You know, thank you, Mark, for leaving that because on those tough days, that's what I go do.

1601
02:41:34.78 --> 02:41:44.78
And it really changes things, you know, when I go to an Air Force base or go in a village in and see the, you know, Vietnam veteran hats or whatever, and you go up and you do that for him.

1602
02:41:44.78 --> 02:41:47.78
And it, you know, it really makes a difference in the last time.

1603
02:41:47.78 --> 02:41:50.78
They're like, no, I'm good, ma'am. I'm like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.

1604
02:41:50.78 --> 02:41:53.78
My son's last letter home challenge. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

1605
02:41:53.78 --> 02:41:58.78
But and we expanded that program. It goes up to a $5,000 grant.

1606
02:41:58.78 --> 02:42:02.78
So just this last week, we had two different SEAL families.

1607
02:42:02.78 --> 02:42:14.78
We do all branches of the military. Obviously, the SEAL communities, my family, so, you know, we do a lot for them, but had circumstances that we were able to help with a $5,000 check for each family.

1608
02:42:14.78 --> 02:42:25.78
You know, that the veteran can't come out because there are veterans, unfortunately, are just going from charity to charity to see what they can take, you know, and that's not who we want to help.

1609
02:42:25.78 --> 02:42:34.78
So, you know, you could reach out and say, you know, here's the circumstance, you know, their child has cancer and, you know, they need somebody to take care of their other kids.

1610
02:42:34.78 --> 02:42:41.78
Why they're in the hospital all the time or, you know, unfortunately, do a lot of funeral expenses.

1611
02:42:41.78 --> 02:42:46.78
But those are huge. That lets somebody know they're not alone in the midst of that.

1612
02:42:46.78 --> 02:42:51.78
We do our Gold Star family program. I was going to say, yeah, the Gold Star retreats that you do.

1613
02:42:51.78 --> 02:42:55.78
We do those in Texas. We've been doing those for 12 years.

1614
02:42:55.78 --> 02:43:00.78
And again, my philosophy on grieving is it needs to be natural. Don't force me.

1615
02:43:00.78 --> 02:43:06.78
If I'm having a good day, please don't put me in a circle with 20 other Gold Star moms, and we're all telling our loved ones story.

1616
02:43:06.78 --> 02:43:10.78
We're all going to be blubbering idiots, you know, when we get done.

1617
02:43:10.78 --> 02:43:16.78
If we're sitting at a table and we're sharing a meal and you want to say, hey, what do you do on his anniversary?

1618
02:43:16.78 --> 02:43:22.78
You know, how do you handle the birthday? Does this feeling normal for you? You know, it's natural.

1619
02:43:22.78 --> 02:43:29.78
You've got a choice whether you participate or not. You know, again, there's swimming pools, there's kayaking, there's ziplining, paddle boarding.

1620
02:43:29.78 --> 02:43:34.78
One time I accidentally said, we're waterboarding and they're like, oh, no, sorry, but bring the terrace here.

1621
02:43:34.78 --> 02:43:42.78
I know problem waterboarding them. But we have a house in Arizona called the Heroes Hope Home and one in Florida called the Strenity Hope Home

1622
02:43:42.78 --> 02:43:48.78
where they can come stay free for a week. We take care of their flights, their rental car, everything and just love and pamper on them.

1623
02:43:48.78 --> 02:43:52.78
Let them know. We won't forget your hero and we won't forget you.

1624
02:43:52.78 --> 02:43:55.78
Our biggest program right now is our Helping Heroes Heal program.

1625
02:43:55.78 --> 02:43:56.78
Right.

1626
02:43:56.78 --> 02:44:03.78
And that's for our veterans, combat veterans who are diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress, many of them suicidal.

1627
02:44:03.78 --> 02:44:11.78
Now we're paying for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, hormone and supplement therapy, natural things that are actually healing them.

1628
02:44:11.78 --> 02:44:15.78
There's so many things out there that are just masking the symptoms.

1629
02:44:15.78 --> 02:44:24.78
And I get it. I really do understand why they want to try anything and everything to get rid of the pain, whether it's physical, mental, spiritual, all the above.

1630
02:44:24.78 --> 02:44:30.78
I get that. But let's try things that are proven to heal you.

1631
02:44:30.78 --> 02:44:33.78
We've been doing spec scans of the brain before and after.

1632
02:44:33.78 --> 02:44:37.78
And to see those is just phenomenal.

1633
02:44:37.78 --> 02:44:42.78
Some of them, I see them the first time before they go through the treatment. I'm like, how are you even functioning?

1634
02:44:42.78 --> 02:44:45.78
I mean, literally, it looks like an RPG went through their head.

1635
02:44:45.78 --> 02:44:50.78
There's just part of it that there's not getting any oxygen to it.

1636
02:44:50.78 --> 02:44:56.78
And then to see that contrasting scan afterwards and to hear their stories.

1637
02:44:56.78 --> 02:45:05.78
And I remember, it's probably been about four years ago now, but we had another Navy SEAL who had gone through the program and I called to just check and see what symptoms are different.

1638
02:45:05.78 --> 02:45:10.78
You know, what'd you notice? Because everybody heals differently. Everybody has a different extent of their injuries.

1639
02:45:10.78 --> 02:45:14.78
And he went through the things that were better and I'm like, that's awesome. He goes, you saved my life.

1640
02:45:14.78 --> 02:45:21.78
And I said, well, you were willing to give your life for me. This literally is a no brainer that I would do this for you.

1641
02:45:21.78 --> 02:45:23.78
And he paused and he said, stop.

1642
02:45:23.78 --> 02:45:28.78
I'm like, raw, raw, made a Navy SEAL man. This is not going to end well.

1643
02:45:28.78 --> 02:45:35.78
He goes, I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for you and your foundation and the therapies you provided.

1644
02:45:35.78 --> 02:45:38.78
You saved my life.

1645
02:45:38.78 --> 02:45:47.78
And when he said it that strong, I thought of Mark, his final actions, standing up in the line of fire to save his teammates.

1646
02:45:47.78 --> 02:45:54.78
And I was like, oh my gosh, he's still saving his teammates. He's not physically here, but he's still saving his teammates.

1647
02:45:54.78 --> 02:46:04.78
And so to see that impact, you know, to continue to be, even if that were only one time, mission accomplished, woohoo,

1648
02:46:04.78 --> 02:46:12.78
but to see that continue to happen over and over and over and, you know, I know yesterday as we're at the funeral,

1649
02:46:12.78 --> 02:46:18.78
there's, you know, so many more of our guys that this has caused things to surface in them.

1650
02:46:18.78 --> 02:46:25.78
And I probably had at least 10 yesterday that were like, we need to help Mama Lee.

1651
02:46:25.78 --> 02:46:31.78
I'm like, here, here's my card, send me your email, we'll get you an application, we'll get things going.

1652
02:46:31.78 --> 02:46:36.78
And on average, the cost is $20,000 for them to go through a year-long program.

1653
02:46:36.78 --> 02:46:38.78
Last year we had 175 guys in our program.

1654
02:46:38.78 --> 02:46:40.78
And Gals, we do boat branches.

1655
02:46:40.78 --> 02:46:47.78
I see guys kind of generically, but including our women, because we have some amazing female veterans that need help as well.

1656
02:46:47.78 --> 02:47:00.78
But to have that opportunity to see that impact, woof, you know, that God allowed me to be able to do that

1657
02:47:00.78 --> 02:47:07.78
and to be able to continue to meet so many of our amazing warriors who give so much and their families.

1658
02:47:07.78 --> 02:47:13.78
You know, it really is a blessing, but, you know, it's not cheap to provide those therapies.

1659
02:47:13.78 --> 02:47:19.78
And I just really want to encourage any of you, guys and Gals that are listening who served,

1660
02:47:19.78 --> 02:47:26.78
if you are diagnosed with TBI or PTS, if you're struggling with suicide, please, please reach out.

1661
02:47:26.78 --> 02:47:30.78
I know that you get to that place where you feel like there's no hope.

1662
02:47:30.78 --> 02:47:37.78
You've tried different therapies that maybe haven't worked, and you feel like this is how I'm going to have to live the rest of my life.

1663
02:47:37.78 --> 02:47:43.78
And it doesn't have to be that way. There are actually physical things that are happening to the frontal lobe of your brain,

1664
02:47:43.78 --> 02:47:46.78
to other parts of your brain from the blast wave exposure.

1665
02:47:46.78 --> 02:47:49.78
That affects your memory. That affects your sleep.

1666
02:47:49.78 --> 02:47:55.78
There's parts of your brain, irrational decision making, and there's things that we can do to heal that.

1667
02:47:55.78 --> 02:48:00.78
So please, that is not a sign of weakness to ask for help.

1668
02:48:00.78 --> 02:48:02.78
That takes courage. That takes strength.

1669
02:48:02.78 --> 02:48:08.78
You're being a leader to be able to do that. So please reach out to us.

1670
02:48:08.78 --> 02:48:11.78
My husband committed suicide 28 years ago.

1671
02:48:11.78 --> 02:48:15.78
So that's another thing that we've lived through that gives us the ability.

1672
02:48:15.78 --> 02:48:20.78
You're not going to say anything that's going to freak me out or scare me or cause me to act irrationally.

1673
02:48:20.78 --> 02:48:26.78
I'm going to be there to give you hope, to listen to you, to encourage you,

1674
02:48:26.78 --> 02:48:29.78
and let you know in that healing process where you're at.

1675
02:48:29.78 --> 02:48:34.78
And we've suffered too many losses and it's got to stop.

1676
02:48:34.78 --> 02:48:44.78
It's got to start a different attitude, you know, at the head shed in our different branches of the military.

1677
02:48:44.78 --> 02:48:48.78
You know, I tell them, if you watched your leg in combat, you wouldn't be like,

1678
02:48:48.78 --> 02:48:50.78
I'm good. I got this. I'm fine.

1679
02:48:50.78 --> 02:48:53.78
No, you'd be like, get a tourniquet quick.

1680
02:48:53.78 --> 02:48:57.78
And that's what we need to be doing and it's not just emotional.

1681
02:48:57.78 --> 02:49:00.78
There are physical things that are going on.

1682
02:49:00.78 --> 02:49:06.78
And when you guys notice those differences, you need to say quick, get a tourniquet. I need help.

1683
02:49:06.78 --> 02:49:10.78
Yeah, I've had a bunch of friends that have gone through your protocol.

1684
02:49:10.78 --> 02:49:14.78
And like you said, so it's the hyperbaric chamber.

1685
02:49:14.78 --> 02:49:16.78
What is it once a day, twice a day?

1686
02:49:16.78 --> 02:49:20.78
Once a day is the preferred. So 40 consecutive treatments.

1687
02:49:20.78 --> 02:49:23.78
The therapy does build on the oxygen from the first treatment.

1688
02:49:23.78 --> 02:49:27.78
The second treatment built on that has a greater impact, greater impact.

1689
02:49:27.78 --> 02:49:29.78
So it does need to be 40 consecutive.

1690
02:49:29.78 --> 02:49:37.78
Sometimes we can't get time, you know, if guys are still contracting and they're still going overseas and stuff, they can't do that.

1691
02:49:37.78 --> 02:49:41.78
Then it's like two days, two times a day, but four hours apart or something like that.

1692
02:49:41.78 --> 02:49:46.78
There has to be four hours in between so they don't risk oxygen toxicity, but it's so safe.

1693
02:49:46.78 --> 02:49:53.78
There's not any, you know, it's like you read the prescription bottles for a lot of the medications that our veterans are taking.

1694
02:49:53.78 --> 02:49:58.78
And, you know, two thirds of them say may cause suicidal tendency.

1695
02:49:58.78 --> 02:50:03.78
I'm not a doctor. I've never played one on TV, but that makes no sense to me.

1696
02:50:03.78 --> 02:50:10.78
Why? Even if it were a small chance, if they're already depressed and discouraged, why would we give them something that that could be a side effect?

1697
02:50:10.78 --> 02:50:17.78
And the impact, we had one of our veterans who was on 53 prescription drugs at the same time.

1698
02:50:17.78 --> 02:50:20.78
Your kidney and your liver is not designed to process that.

1699
02:50:20.78 --> 02:50:22.78
How can that be even frequently?

1700
02:50:22.78 --> 02:50:26.78
That should be malpractice. Yeah, that just makes no sense to me either.

1701
02:50:26.78 --> 02:50:32.78
And half the time, one prescription they're giving you is to relieve the symptom from the other prescription.

1702
02:50:32.78 --> 02:50:35.78
You know, it's like, oh my goodness.

1703
02:50:35.78 --> 02:50:40.78
So it's the hyperbaric chambers, the hormones, it's the vitamin therapy.

1704
02:50:40.78 --> 02:50:46.78
It's working out, eating good, not, you know, stop freaking drinking.

1705
02:50:46.78 --> 02:50:50.78
Yes, there are things that you need to do to be responsible for this.

1706
02:50:50.78 --> 02:50:55.78
And I get it. We're such a world that we put something in the microwave for a minute.

1707
02:50:55.78 --> 02:50:58.78
We get frustrated because it's not done cooking.

1708
02:50:58.78 --> 02:51:04.78
You know, we want to stop one step, take this pill, do this treatment, and I'm healed.

1709
02:51:04.78 --> 02:51:06.78
I'm good to go.

1710
02:51:06.78 --> 02:51:08.78
And they don't want to assume responsibility.

1711
02:51:08.78 --> 02:51:14.78
You know, the things that you're doing, we've also done spec scans on people that are drinking

1712
02:51:14.78 --> 02:51:16.78
and compared that to a TBI.

1713
02:51:16.78 --> 02:51:22.78
And the alcohol is just as bad as the last wave of exposure that's damaged your brain.

1714
02:51:22.78 --> 02:51:25.78
Same thing with the marijuana, the illegal drugs.

1715
02:51:25.78 --> 02:51:28.78
Stop already. Do you really want to get well?

1716
02:51:28.78 --> 02:51:33.78
Like I said, I get why you want to mask the symptoms, but you're only making it worse.

1717
02:51:33.78 --> 02:51:36.78
And so you need to do those things. You need to be working out regularly.

1718
02:51:36.78 --> 02:51:38.78
There's a feel-good endorphin.

1719
02:51:38.78 --> 02:51:41.78
I wrote something about a year and a half ago that was probably going to be published,

1720
02:51:41.78 --> 02:51:44.78
and I'm like, okay, I can't just put in there. It's a feel-good endorphin.

1721
02:51:44.78 --> 02:51:48.78
So I researched it to see what that endorphin was called.

1722
02:51:48.78 --> 02:51:52.78
Well, it's just called an endorphin, but it said it can have the same impact as morphine.

1723
02:51:52.78 --> 02:51:58.78
I'm like, holy cow, how do we feel so good when we do an intense workout?

1724
02:51:58.78 --> 02:52:05.78
For your brain health, the most effective way to eat is the high protein low-garb.

1725
02:52:05.78 --> 02:52:10.78
And so make those choices. Do those things that are not damaging yourselves,

1726
02:52:10.78 --> 02:52:13.78
not destroying more than you already have.

1727
02:52:13.78 --> 02:52:19.78
And so many of you guys and gals have been fighters. You know.

1728
02:52:19.78 --> 02:52:23.78
It's a different battle now, and you still have to know the enemy.

1729
02:52:23.78 --> 02:52:27.78
You have to know the tactics. You have to put on your full armor every day.

1730
02:52:27.78 --> 02:52:30.78
You know, I can guarantee you, Jocko, you never went out in combat.

1731
02:52:30.78 --> 02:52:33.78
We're like, yeah, I don't think I need my weapon today. I'll be good.

1732
02:52:33.78 --> 02:52:38.78
No, that's crazy. You didn't say, I'm not taking grenades with me today,

1733
02:52:38.78 --> 02:52:41.78
or I'm not taking my water. That's, you know, extra weight. I'll be good.

1734
02:52:41.78 --> 02:52:48.78
No, you put your full kit on, and you were prepared for plan A, B, C, D,

1735
02:52:48.78 --> 02:52:52.78
however far you needed to go. You probably even put an extra grenade in there

1736
02:52:52.78 --> 02:52:56.78
just to be ready, but you knew the enemy. You knew the tactics.

1737
02:52:56.78 --> 02:53:01.78
And, you know, there's a component of spiritual battle that's going on here, too.

1738
02:53:01.78 --> 02:53:05.78
And so you have to know that enemy. You need to put on your gear every day

1739
02:53:05.78 --> 02:53:11.78
and be prepared. And then the self-talk that we tell ourselves,

1740
02:53:11.78 --> 02:53:14.78
you know, I think back to after I went through that divorce,

1741
02:53:14.78 --> 02:53:17.78
and even though I divorced him, he's like, you're fat, you're ugly,

1742
02:53:17.78 --> 02:53:19.78
nobody's ever going to love you.

1743
02:53:19.78 --> 02:53:23.78
And so that tape that played over and over in my brain was, you're unlovable.

1744
02:53:23.78 --> 02:53:27.78
You're unlovable. Who's going to want a woman with three children?

1745
02:53:27.78 --> 02:53:32.78
And like I said, about when I was 28, you know,

1746
02:53:32.78 --> 02:53:36.78
surrendered everything to Christ. I started, I read a scripture and it says,

1747
02:53:36.78 --> 02:53:40.78
you're fearfully and wonderfully made. I'm like, wait, wait, wait.

1748
02:53:40.78 --> 02:53:43.78
That's what Christ says about me. Okay, this other crap's a lie then.

1749
02:53:43.78 --> 02:53:48.78
And so every time he would try to do that, I'm like, no, that's not the truth.

1750
02:53:48.78 --> 02:53:53.78
And now that tape rarely plays because he knows that's not effective on me.

1751
02:53:53.78 --> 02:53:59.78
But we have to reprogram that self-talk that we tell ourselves, you know,

1752
02:53:59.78 --> 02:54:02.78
and find something to replace it. You can't just say, I'm going to stop saying that

1753
02:54:02.78 --> 02:54:05.78
because you've got to have something else to replace that with.

1754
02:54:05.78 --> 02:54:08.78
And so you find out what that truth is, whatever you're struggling with,

1755
02:54:08.78 --> 02:54:13.78
I can guarantee you there's a scripture in the Bible that deals with that,

1756
02:54:13.78 --> 02:54:18.78
that that one you've got that memorized, but you've got to do that warfare.

1757
02:54:18.78 --> 02:54:22.78
It's a different kind of battle, but it is still a battle.

1758
02:54:22.78 --> 02:54:25.78
And you're helping people with that battle? Yes.

1759
02:54:25.78 --> 02:54:28.78
I know I read like a stat on your organization,

1760
02:54:28.78 --> 02:54:33.78
96.28% of the funds that you receive go to treatment.

1761
02:54:33.78 --> 02:54:35.78
That's freaking awesome.

1762
02:54:35.78 --> 02:54:40.78
I am what my board says politely, very frugal.

1763
02:54:40.78 --> 02:54:43.78
But I did not take a salary for the first 10 years.

1764
02:54:43.78 --> 02:54:48.78
I was so committed to making sure you guys got the healing.

1765
02:54:48.78 --> 02:54:51.78
And not that because I take a salary now, I'm not committed,

1766
02:54:51.78 --> 02:54:58.78
but I wanted to prove ourselves as one of those charities that don't waste your money.

1767
02:54:58.78 --> 02:55:03.78
When you're given your money test, you can count on it's not being wasted.

1768
02:55:03.78 --> 02:55:06.78
We're not having a big party somewhere, you know,

1769
02:55:06.78 --> 02:55:10.78
making our CEO come in on a flying something or other.

1770
02:55:10.78 --> 02:55:13.78
I don't know. There's some bizarre stuff out there.

1771
02:55:13.78 --> 02:55:17.78
And I think a lot of these people when they started probably had pure hearts,

1772
02:55:17.78 --> 02:55:19.78
but then the money entices them.

1773
02:55:19.78 --> 02:55:21.78
I'm not a person that's driven by money.

1774
02:55:21.78 --> 02:55:26.78
Yeah, we all need money to survive in the world, but that's not why I wake up every day.

1775
02:55:26.78 --> 02:55:32.78
My mission is to wake up every day and get help to our veterans and our Gold Star families.

1776
02:55:32.78 --> 02:55:39.78
Yeah, it's been an amazing run, so I'm very frugal how that money is spent.

1777
02:55:39.78 --> 02:55:44.78
And we're fortunate we've got a ton of people that do volunteer.

1778
02:55:44.78 --> 02:55:48.78
If you've got a skill or talent that you can give, if you're a CPA,

1779
02:55:48.78 --> 02:55:51.78
we could use someone to donate an audit.

1780
02:55:51.78 --> 02:55:53.78
We've got a lawyer on our board, so that's taken care of.

1781
02:55:53.78 --> 02:55:54.78
We don't pay legal fees.

1782
02:55:54.78 --> 02:55:58.78
If you're a graphic design artist or social media, reach out.

1783
02:55:58.78 --> 02:56:03.78
We need volunteers to help that are willing to do those things for us as well

1784
02:56:03.78 --> 02:56:06.78
so we can continue to make our dollar go so much further.

1785
02:56:06.78 --> 02:56:10.78
Yeah, and that, again, just going back to the program, which I've had friends go through.

1786
02:56:10.78 --> 02:56:14.78
I haven't gone through it, but I've had friends go through it to help them so much.

1787
02:56:14.78 --> 02:56:21.78
It's like, think of the reset that you get by, I don't know if I should use this term,

1788
02:56:21.78 --> 02:56:28.78
a freaking 40-day vacation where you get to get this awesome treatment,

1789
02:56:28.78 --> 02:56:31.78
you get good food, you got stress removed from your life,

1790
02:56:31.78 --> 02:56:34.78
and it's like a reset on people's minds.

1791
02:56:34.78 --> 02:56:40.78
Then it's the aspect of the oxygen, pressurized oxygen therapy that you're getting

1792
02:56:40.78 --> 02:56:44.78
to get that oxygen into places in your brain that hasn't had it for a while.

1793
02:56:44.78 --> 02:56:50.78
It's like a legitimate reset for people, and it's so helpful to them.

1794
02:56:50.78 --> 02:56:53.78
It is expensive because you're sending people, you have to pay for their food,

1795
02:56:53.78 --> 02:56:59.78
for where they're going to live, they stay in a hotel or whatever for this extended period of time, for 40 days.

1796
02:56:59.78 --> 02:57:01.78
But that's what you need to do.

1797
02:57:01.78 --> 02:57:07.78
If you've bounced off the track, you can't just get back on the track in a day or two days.

1798
02:57:07.78 --> 02:57:13.78
You need to take a serious reset time and get it back together, and that's what you're doing.

1799
02:57:13.78 --> 02:57:15.78
Yeah, it's a commitment.

1800
02:57:15.78 --> 02:57:18.78
We work with facilities all over the United States,

1801
02:57:18.78 --> 02:57:22.78
sometimes there's a clinic near you and you don't have to go away for the 40 days,

1802
02:57:22.78 --> 02:57:25.78
but you do have to then arrange your schedule.

1803
02:57:25.78 --> 02:57:29.78
If you're going at 7 o'clock in the morning and it's a half an hour to drive to get there,

1804
02:57:29.78 --> 02:57:37.78
it's going to be a couple hours out of your day, but it is so worth that commitment for the life change that happens.

1805
02:57:37.78 --> 02:57:39.78
The battle.

1806
02:57:39.78 --> 02:57:47.78
You are like the Pentagon of the battle running things.

1807
02:57:47.78 --> 02:57:49.78
That's how you do it.

1808
02:57:49.78 --> 02:57:51.78
That's what you do.

1809
02:57:51.78 --> 02:57:53.78
You do it for others, just like Mark.

1810
02:57:53.78 --> 02:57:55.78
Just like Mark.

1811
02:57:55.78 --> 02:57:57.78
What else?

1812
02:57:57.78 --> 02:57:59.78
Are we up to date?

1813
02:57:59.78 --> 02:58:01.78
We caught up.

1814
02:58:01.78 --> 02:58:03.78
Is that what we're doing?

1815
02:58:03.78 --> 02:58:05.78
Is that where we're at right now?

1816
02:58:05.78 --> 02:58:07.78
Maybe.

1817
02:58:07.78 --> 02:58:09.78
Maybe.

1818
02:58:09.78 --> 02:58:11.78
Try to think if there's anything else.

1819
02:58:11.78 --> 02:58:14.78
Again, just a reminder that if you need help, we are here.

1820
02:58:14.78 --> 02:58:16.78
There's no excuse.

1821
02:58:16.78 --> 02:58:18.78
We're here to help people who we're taking care of.

1822
02:58:18.78 --> 02:58:20.78
Your information doesn't go anywhere.

1823
02:58:20.78 --> 02:58:22.78
We don't report it to your commands.

1824
02:58:22.78 --> 02:58:24.78
We're here to help.

1825
02:58:24.78 --> 02:58:27.78
Obviously, we've already had a huge outpouring.

1826
02:58:27.78 --> 02:58:30.78
So if you're someone that can help support a veteran,

1827
02:58:30.78 --> 02:58:37.78
if you're a corporation and you can do a nice charity or donation to our charity,

1828
02:58:37.78 --> 02:58:45.78
if you can organize a fundraiser, we need the money to come in to be able to continue to take care of these guys.

1829
02:58:45.78 --> 02:58:52.78
I'm not going to be happy camper if we ever got to a place where someone who was struggling to reach out calls finally.

1830
02:58:52.78 --> 02:58:56.78
I have to say, I'm sorry we don't have any money to be able to do that for you.

1831
02:58:56.78 --> 02:58:58.78
That ain't going to happen.

1832
02:58:58.78 --> 02:59:00.78
I'm going to be selling my own stuff.

1833
02:59:00.78 --> 02:59:09.78
Come on, these are our men and women who have sacrificed greatly for us.

1834
02:59:09.78 --> 02:59:15.78
I feel like we do a terrible job as a nation getting your health restored to you.

1835
02:59:15.78 --> 02:59:23.78
Especially in our community, you get the best training, you get the best equipment, you get the best missions.

1836
02:59:23.78 --> 02:59:29.78
Then you come home and you get out and I feel like it's that leaving a man behind.

1837
02:59:29.78 --> 02:59:31.78
Like, bye, see ya, thanks.

1838
02:59:31.78 --> 02:59:35.78
We're getting better, we're improving on some things, but not at all where it should be.

1839
02:59:35.78 --> 02:59:46.78
I know there are some good VAs, but they should be disgraceful for the lack of the care and the time that our veterans have to wait.

1840
02:59:46.78 --> 02:59:50.78
Again, I'm not going to sit around and wait and say, well, they should do.

1841
02:59:50.78 --> 02:59:52.78
No, let's go.

1842
02:59:52.78 --> 03:00:02.78
Mark's final words as he got ready to go upstairs that day were on me.

1843
03:00:02.78 --> 03:00:05.78
What you guys know what he was saying, he's like, I got the lead on this.

1844
03:00:05.78 --> 03:00:06.78
You guys follow me.

1845
03:00:06.78 --> 03:00:07.78
I can't do it alone.

1846
03:00:07.78 --> 03:00:10.78
Let's go together as a team.

1847
03:00:10.78 --> 03:00:12.78
And that's what it is.

1848
03:00:12.78 --> 03:00:13.78
And that's my challenge.

1849
03:00:13.78 --> 03:00:16.78
I'm saying, on me, come on people, let's go.

1850
03:00:16.78 --> 03:00:25.78
Whether you need help and you need to reach out and ask for help, whether you can help support us, whether you can donate monthly, whether you can donate a service, it's a team.

1851
03:00:25.78 --> 03:00:29.78
This doesn't just happen because Debbie does it every day.

1852
03:00:29.78 --> 03:00:35.78
And I'm blessed, Choco, by you guys who faithfully do the match when we do the muster.

1853
03:00:35.78 --> 03:00:39.78
And on average, we'll raise $30,000, $40,000 at a muster.

1854
03:00:39.78 --> 03:00:43.78
And the different clients that you've worked with, they've spread the word.

1855
03:00:43.78 --> 03:00:48.78
So thank you for the impact that you guys have made and continue to make.

1856
03:00:48.78 --> 03:00:59.78
But most of all, thank you for being Mark's brothers and that I'm blessed to be Mama Lee and have you guys as part of the family.

1857
03:00:59.78 --> 03:01:03.78
And so, so, so grateful.

1858
03:01:03.78 --> 03:01:10.78
Well, like you said, I mean, Mark is just still taking care of his teammates, still giving.

1859
03:01:10.78 --> 03:01:20.78
You know, it's like you think Mark has given everything, he's not, he's still finding more to give, still saving guys, still helping his teammates.

1860
03:01:20.78 --> 03:01:25.78
And that's where that's what it's all about.

1861
03:01:25.78 --> 03:01:34.78
And again, it's a choice, no matter what you're facing, whether, you know, I had no choice the news that was given to me on August 2nd.

1862
03:01:34.78 --> 03:01:40.78
I could have stuffed my fingers in my ear, I could have refused to go home, talked to the Kaco officer.

1863
03:01:40.78 --> 03:01:43.78
But I wanted to change the fact that Mark was gone.

1864
03:01:43.78 --> 03:01:52.78
And oftentimes in life, we're faced with financial health relationship issues, or maybe we don't have a choice.

1865
03:01:52.78 --> 03:01:57.78
Maybe some of them are self-inflicted like some of mine were.

1866
03:01:57.78 --> 03:02:00.78
But we do have a choice how we respond.

1867
03:02:00.78 --> 03:02:07.78
And to curl up in a ball and feel sorry for yourself or blame it on somebody else, isn't going to change it.

1868
03:02:07.78 --> 03:02:12.78
You got to get up, you got to make a choice, and you got to move forward.

1869
03:02:12.78 --> 03:02:21.78
And I think a big part of some of the struggles that I've seen are men and women is the shame issue.

1870
03:02:21.78 --> 03:02:24.78
You know, let go of that shame, let go of that guilt.

1871
03:02:24.78 --> 03:02:29.78
If there is something you're involved in, ask for forgiveness.

1872
03:02:29.78 --> 03:02:35.78
And then let it go. Don't keep picking it up and carrying it on.

1873
03:02:42.78 --> 03:02:45.78
Probably a good place to stop for the day.

1874
03:02:45.78 --> 03:02:48.78
Echo, do you got any questions?

1875
03:02:48.78 --> 03:02:50.78
I have nothing today. Good to see you.

1876
03:02:50.78 --> 03:02:52.78
Yeah, very good to see you as always.

1877
03:02:52.78 --> 03:02:55.78
You need to speak a little bit less though.

1878
03:02:55.78 --> 03:02:59.78
That's what they say sometimes.

1879
03:02:59.78 --> 03:03:03.78

1880
03:03:03.78 --> 03:03:06.78

Facebook, Americas Mighty Warriors.

1884
03:03:14.78 --> 03:03:18.78
You got a YouTube channel, Americas Mighty Warriors.

1885
03:03:18.78 --> 03:03:19.78
So...

1886
03:03:19.78 --> 03:03:23.78
Yeah, I think one of those movies, or one of those movies that I don't know.

1887
03:03:23.78 --> 03:03:26.78
One of the YouTube's is You, Jaco, when we did the On Me 20.

1888
03:03:26.78 --> 03:03:27.78
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1889
03:03:27.78 --> 03:03:29.78
We did it in the beginning of COVID.

1890
03:03:29.78 --> 03:03:32.78
Yep, and we did 20 podcasts, 20 Days in a Row.

1891
03:03:32.78 --> 03:03:34.78
Whew, won't do that again, but...

1892
03:03:34.78 --> 03:03:38.78
It's a lot different when you're on it versus when you're organizing it

1893
03:03:38.78 --> 03:03:42.78
and planning it and promoting it, but there's some great wisdom.

1894
03:03:42.78 --> 03:03:44.78
We had so many great guys come on there.

1895
03:03:44.78 --> 03:03:47.78
So, yes, we have a YouTube channel.

1896
03:03:47.78 --> 03:03:51.78
Anything else, Momily, for us?

1897
03:03:51.78 --> 03:03:53.78
Let's go get some.

1898
03:03:53.78 --> 03:03:56.78
We're definitely going to go get some.

1899
03:03:56.78 --> 03:03:58.78
Thanks so much for joining us today.

1900
03:03:58.78 --> 03:04:04.78
I know I didn't have you on here for a long time,

1901
03:04:04.78 --> 03:04:10.78
and I was super not ready to have you on here.

1902
03:04:10.78 --> 03:04:15.78
And, you know, the way things happened, George Montsour,

1903
03:04:15.78 --> 03:04:20.78
you know, they had that book come out, and, you know, we were talking,

1904
03:04:20.78 --> 03:04:24.78
and I was like, you know, come on the podcast, and as soon as I got done,

1905
03:04:24.78 --> 03:04:25.78
we were recording with him.

1906
03:04:25.78 --> 03:04:26.78
I sent you a text, and I said,

1907
03:04:26.78 --> 03:04:28.78
I just had George Montsour on the podcast.

1908
03:04:28.78 --> 03:04:29.78
He's like, I can do this.

1909
03:04:29.78 --> 03:04:32.78
And that means, and I got forced into that one, you know,

1910
03:04:32.78 --> 03:04:36.78
I got forced into that one, and I said, you know, let's go.

1911
03:04:36.78 --> 03:04:42.78
And, you know, I think you've told me many times that you've seen me cry.

1912
03:04:42.78 --> 03:04:46.78
I think you've seen me cry more than anybody, so just you got that going for you.

1913
03:04:46.78 --> 03:04:47.78
That marks great.

1914
03:04:47.78 --> 03:04:50.78
And I'm like, oh, that's probably not the image Jaco wants out there,

1915
03:04:50.78 --> 03:04:52.78
but again, people, this is who Jaco is.

1916
03:04:52.78 --> 03:04:57.78
You know, we see your picture, you know, the tough, you know,

1917
03:04:57.78 --> 03:05:01.78
knuckle-dragger kind of, you know, and that's not who, you know,

1918
03:05:01.78 --> 03:05:04.78
and you're always the square, you know, face when you're doing,

1919
03:05:04.78 --> 03:05:06.78
or whatever the thing is.

1920
03:05:06.78 --> 03:05:08.78
I do have a square face.

1921
03:05:08.78 --> 03:05:11.78
But I tell you what, he does have a sense of humor, people.

1922
03:05:11.78 --> 03:05:16.78
He does have emotions, and very much carries that, marks lost.

1923
03:05:16.78 --> 03:05:18.78
Yeah.

1924
03:05:18.78 --> 03:05:24.78
Well, yeah, and that's like, you know, that's again,

1925
03:05:24.78 --> 03:05:28.78
that's why it was really hard for me to say, you know,

1926
03:05:28.78 --> 03:05:32.78
what I got to do this, and it was George Montsour and Mikey,

1927
03:05:32.78 --> 03:05:37.78
you know, pushing me over the edge, because I know it's super emotional,

1928
03:05:37.78 --> 03:05:41.78
obviously, and if it's emotional for me,

1929
03:05:41.78 --> 03:05:45.78
I can't even imagine how emotional it is for you guys.

1930
03:05:45.78 --> 03:05:49.78
But I'm so glad that you're able to come out here today,

1931
03:05:49.78 --> 03:05:53.78
and you know, that you've been with us through so much, you know,

1932
03:05:53.78 --> 03:05:59.78
you've been with us through so many really, really horrible things,

1933
03:05:59.78 --> 03:06:03.78
and you've always been there for us since day one.

1934
03:06:03.78 --> 03:06:06.78
So thank you for all that.

1935
03:06:06.78 --> 03:06:08.78
Thanks for bringing Mark into this world.

1936
03:06:08.78 --> 03:06:10.78
My blessing.

1937
03:06:10.78 --> 03:06:16.78
You raised a warrior, and you raised a warrior who willingly sacrificed

1938
03:06:16.78 --> 03:06:21.78
his life for his friends, and we won't ever forget him.

1939
03:06:21.78 --> 03:06:24.78
And thank you for all of that.

1940
03:06:24.78 --> 03:06:28.78
Thank you for what you're continuing to do now.

1941
03:06:28.78 --> 03:06:33.78
Supporting all our veterans, supporting all our veteran families.

1942
03:06:33.78 --> 03:06:37.78
Your strength is absolutely incredible.

1943
03:06:37.78 --> 03:06:43.78
It's absolutely incredible, and the work that you're doing

1944
03:06:43.78 --> 03:06:48.78
is impacting the lives of countless people,

1945
03:06:48.78 --> 03:06:55.78
people that I personally know, and all of that stems from,

1946
03:06:55.78 --> 03:06:58.78
well, from the Mark that you made.

1947
03:06:58.78 --> 03:07:00.78
Yeah, he made his Mark.

1948
03:07:00.78 --> 03:07:03.78
I was like, I'm not making my Mark, but yes.

1949
03:07:03.78 --> 03:07:07.78
But again, everybody else can make their Mark, you're halfway through the deployment.

1950
03:07:07.78 --> 03:07:09.78
Get your butts up and make a difference.

1951
03:07:09.78 --> 03:07:10.78
That's what it is.

1952
03:07:10.78 --> 03:07:12.78
Thank you, Momaly.

1953
03:07:12.78 --> 03:07:13.78
Thank you.

1954
03:07:13.78 --> 03:07:15.78
Love you.

1955
03:07:15.78 --> 03:07:21.78
And with that, Momaly has left the building.

1956
03:07:26.78 --> 03:07:29.78
Lots going on in that podcast, and you know,

1957
03:07:29.78 --> 03:07:33.78
Momaly and I talked for a long time before it, a long time after it.

1958
03:07:33.78 --> 03:07:50.78
So, just very heavy and very lucky that we had Mark in our lives

1959
03:07:50.78 --> 03:07:53.78
and very lucky and very blessed to have Momaly in our lives.

1960
03:07:53.78 --> 03:08:00.78
So, you know, as she said, we need to live a good life,

1961
03:08:00.78 --> 03:08:04.78
live a life to honor them, which means we need to go get after it.

1962
03:08:04.78 --> 03:08:09.78
It's interesting because I know, Mom, I'm trying to think when the first time I met her was,

1963
03:08:09.78 --> 03:08:12.78
probably at a muster, but I feel like I've known her for so long.

1964
03:08:12.78 --> 03:08:15.78
I see her mostly at the muster events or whatever,

1965
03:08:15.78 --> 03:08:22.78
and it's so interesting how you immediately understand why everyone calls her Momaly.

1966
03:08:22.78 --> 03:08:27.78
She's kind of like, you know, the kind where she's just so happy to see everyone, you know?

1967
03:08:27.78 --> 03:08:30.78
And at first I was like, oh, you know, I must have made an impression on her.

1968
03:08:30.78 --> 03:08:34.78
She's so nice to me, you know, kind of a thing, but it's like, oh yeah, she's just like that.

1969
03:08:34.78 --> 03:08:35.78
She's nice to everybody.

1970
03:08:35.78 --> 03:08:37.78
She's a momaly.

1971
03:08:37.78 --> 03:08:44.78
Yeah, so it's, this all makes sense the way she, like, supports all this stuff,

1972
03:08:44.78 --> 03:08:47.78
all the veterans so passionately, you know?

1973
03:08:47.78 --> 03:08:53.78
Just all, and actually kind of, she made a good point, man, with the charities or whatever,

1974
03:08:53.78 --> 03:08:56.78
where it's like, oh yeah, she kind of mentioned it quick when she's like,

1975
03:08:56.78 --> 03:08:58.78
oh, I'm sure their heart's in the right place at first,

1976
03:08:58.78 --> 03:09:04.78
but when the money starts coming in, then they'll like have a party that's a little bit more lavish or whatever.

1977
03:09:04.78 --> 03:09:13.78
But her, like, the way, like, what she focuses on is like so far from that.

1978
03:09:13.78 --> 03:09:18.78
Almost like you can't really touch that element of her pursuit, you know?

1979
03:09:18.78 --> 03:09:19.78
For sure.

1980
03:09:19.78 --> 03:09:22.78
And I tried to make it clear, I don't know if I did or not,

1981
03:09:22.78 --> 03:09:28.78
but like I have personal friends that have gone through the treatment program that her charity pays for,

1982
03:09:28.78 --> 03:09:32.78
and it's had an immense positive effect.

1983
03:09:32.78 --> 03:09:37.78
So one thing that's kind of cool is like, remember those charities when you were a kid,

1984
03:09:37.78 --> 03:09:42.78
where they'd be like, oh, if you donate this much money, you're going to get this many meals a day for this kid.

1985
03:09:42.78 --> 03:09:46.78
They would like give you a name, and it would kind of connect.

1986
03:09:46.78 --> 03:09:47.78
It's sort of like that.

1987
03:09:47.78 --> 03:09:50.78
Now, you don't get to know the name of the veteran that you're helping,

1988
03:09:50.78 --> 03:09:55.78
but when you donate, like, you are helping a veteran get their life squared away.

1989
03:09:55.78 --> 03:10:00.78
And I really do think that this is like a great first step.

1990
03:10:00.78 --> 03:10:08.78
Like, if you're going to escalate your treatment, this, to me, is a great place to start,

1991
03:10:08.78 --> 03:10:16.78
because it's natural and there's no negative side effects, and you can get it done.

1992
03:10:16.78 --> 03:10:18.78
It's like 100% positive.

1993
03:10:18.78 --> 03:10:22.78
And I think if you try this, there's a decent chance, like, oh, you're going to feel a lot better,

1994
03:10:22.78 --> 03:10:24.78
and then maybe you can start to work some stuff out.

1995
03:10:24.78 --> 03:10:29.78
Look, and there's more extreme measures that people, treatments that people go to.

1996
03:10:29.78 --> 03:10:34.78
I mean, we've had Marcus, Capone on, like, those are some extreme measures.

1997
03:10:34.78 --> 03:10:41.78
And sometimes I think people get to that point, but I think this type of treatment is a great place to start

1998
03:10:41.78 --> 03:10:51.78
to see if we can get some things under control with kind of like the minimum amount of intervention.

1999
03:10:51.78 --> 03:10:52.78
You know what I'm saying?

2000
03:10:52.78 --> 03:10:53.78
Oh, yeah, fully.

2001
03:10:53.78 --> 03:10:55.78
And then it always...

2002
03:10:55.78 --> 03:11:01.78
Like, real quick, like, before you get surgery on your knee, you do rehab first.

2003
03:11:01.78 --> 03:11:07.78
When you get surgery on your back, you try stretching, you try yoga, you try some injections,

2004
03:11:07.78 --> 03:11:13.78
you try other things, and then eventually they go, okay, look, man, you got a real issue that can't be solved through this stuff.

2005
03:11:13.78 --> 03:11:17.78
So I think this is sort of the first...

2006
03:11:17.78 --> 03:11:22.78
Maybe it's the second step, because at first, look, man, quit drinking, eat healthy, work out, like, see how you feel then.

2007
03:11:22.78 --> 03:11:23.78
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

2008
03:11:23.78 --> 03:11:24.78
Okay, that doesn't work.

2009
03:11:24.78 --> 03:11:26.78
Okay, now we're going to try a hyperbaric chamber.

2010
03:11:26.78 --> 03:11:29.78
Now we're going to try some of these vitamin therapy, some of these hormones.

2011
03:11:29.78 --> 03:11:31.78
So that's, I think, the next escalation.

2012
03:11:31.78 --> 03:11:36.78
And then, you know, there's other things you can do, and then eventually you get to a point where you're like, okay, like, I got some friends,

2013
03:11:36.78 --> 03:11:38.78
they're at the end of the rope.

2014
03:11:38.78 --> 03:11:39.78
Okay, what do you need to do?

2015
03:11:39.78 --> 03:11:46.78
Hey, you're going to go and talk to the vets, the Marcus's thing, and get some of that.

2016
03:11:46.78 --> 03:11:47.78
What is it called?

2017
03:11:47.78 --> 03:11:48.78
Psycho...

2018
03:11:48.78 --> 03:11:51.78
One of those drugs called psychedelic therapy, right?

2019
03:11:51.78 --> 03:11:52.78
You might get there.

2020
03:11:52.78 --> 03:11:56.78
But, you know, I would look at it, and some people are scared of that, right?

2021
03:11:56.78 --> 03:11:57.78
Oh, yeah.

2022
03:11:57.78 --> 03:11:58.78
I'm scared of that.

2023
03:11:58.78 --> 03:11:59.78
Like, I don't want to do that.

2024
03:11:59.78 --> 03:12:01.78
I don't think I need to do it.

2025
03:12:01.78 --> 03:12:02.78
Turn into a loving joke.

2026
03:12:02.78 --> 03:12:03.78
No, it's not that.

2027
03:12:03.78 --> 03:12:11.78
I just, it seems like a risk, you know, you start putting things in your system, maybe you open something up, you don't want to open up, right?

2028
03:12:11.78 --> 03:12:13.78
So that seems like a risk to me.

2029
03:12:13.78 --> 03:12:15.78
This is low risk, high reward.

2030
03:12:15.78 --> 03:12:16.78
Yeah.

2031
03:12:16.78 --> 03:12:21.78
So again, like, I think, I know people, I mean, Marcus is a great example of that, right?

2032
03:12:21.78 --> 03:12:22.78
Yeah.

2033
03:12:22.78 --> 03:12:28.78
Like, so, you can get there, and then if you get there, it's like, okay, I get it.

2034
03:12:28.78 --> 03:12:38.78
But this stuff, as an initial start, why not give this a try, see if you can get some problems under control, and maybe you turn out all right.

2035
03:12:38.78 --> 03:12:39.78
Yeah.

2036
03:12:39.78 --> 03:12:48.78
And that's what I think what's great about what Mama Lee's doing, I mean, just like I said, it's a 40-day, I hate to call it a vacation, but it's kind of like a 40-day vacation.

2037
03:12:48.78 --> 03:12:53.78
When you get perfect food, you get, you know, to work out, you get this awesome oxygen treatment.

2038
03:12:53.78 --> 03:13:01.78
So the hyperbaric chamber treatment, that's like reintroducing oxygen to places of your brain that are damaged from lack of oxygen?

2039
03:13:01.78 --> 03:13:03.78
Yeah, and like, things get messed up.

2040
03:13:03.78 --> 03:13:06.78
Look, I don't, I'm not a scientist, clearly.

2041
03:13:06.78 --> 03:13:07.78
No, you're not.

2042
03:13:07.78 --> 03:13:08.78
I don't.

2043
03:13:08.78 --> 03:13:14.78
There's a bunch of, what is it called, literature about how these things help out.

2044
03:13:14.78 --> 03:13:15.78
Right.

2045
03:13:15.78 --> 03:13:35.78
Consider that right, where if you have something physically damaged on your brain, and that's causing this very specific behavior or whatever, like going to some other treatment that doesn't address the physical injury won't, doesn't seem like, I don't know, like, like you, I'm not a scientist, but that part still makes sense, you know, where, like, if, if you're in a

2046
03:13:35.78 --> 03:13:51.78
spiraling thought pattern, that's different than if your brain is physically damaged, like, you know, like, you know, you hear football, we know football players where like, they had literally said, hey, I'm going to commit suicide, I'm not going to shoot myself in the head because I want you to study my brain.

2047
03:13:51.78 --> 03:13:52.78
Like, there's something wrong.

2048
03:13:52.78 --> 03:13:53.78
Junior Seya.

2049
03:13:53.78 --> 03:13:54.78
Yeah, yeah.

2050
03:13:54.78 --> 03:13:55.78
Did you know Junior Seya, personally?

2051
03:13:55.78 --> 03:13:57.78
Yeah, from the, no, not good.

2052
03:13:57.78 --> 03:13:59.78
He came into my club all the time that I used to work at.

2053
03:13:59.78 --> 03:14:06.78
But I met him like, same thing, I met him like at a bar one time, super cool, super chill.

2054
03:14:06.78 --> 03:14:07.78
Yeah.

2055
03:14:07.78 --> 03:14:11.78
And, and, and like, that's one of those cases, you look at a guy that killed himself.

2056
03:14:11.78 --> 03:14:12.78
Yeah.

2057
03:14:12.78 --> 03:14:18.78
You know, Junior Seya, the guy is one of the most beloved athletes in San Diego history.

2058
03:14:18.78 --> 03:14:19.78
Probably, yeah, yeah.

2059
03:14:19.78 --> 03:14:24.78
And if you're going to be a beloved athlete in the city, San Diego is a great city to be a beloved athlete.

2060
03:14:24.78 --> 03:14:30.78
Because San Diego is just a cool place, you know, there's a lot of fun things to do and you go out in San Diego.

2061
03:14:30.78 --> 03:14:31.78
It's not overwhelming.

2062
03:14:31.78 --> 03:14:33.78
Like, let's say you're Michael Jordan in Chicago.

2063
03:14:33.78 --> 03:14:36.78
Sure you're beloved, but you're almost getting mobbed, right?

2064
03:14:36.78 --> 03:14:37.78
Yeah.

2065
03:14:37.78 --> 03:14:43.78
There's a level of chill in San Diego that if you're Junior Seya, you're going out in San Diego,

2066
03:14:43.78 --> 03:14:45.78
you're like having a good time.

2067
03:14:45.78 --> 03:14:49.78
Like I've been out like, like you're saying Junior Seya would go to your club, go to your bar.

2068
03:14:49.78 --> 03:14:50.78
Yeah.

2069
03:14:50.78 --> 03:14:56.78
I've been in bars like seal, like bars that are where a bunch of seals would go.

2070
03:14:56.78 --> 03:14:59.78
And like Junior Seya was, he's not getting mobbed, he's just having a beer or whatever.

2071
03:14:59.78 --> 03:15:00.78
Yeah.

2072
03:15:00.78 --> 03:15:04.78
I don't think there's a lot of cities where that's the same, you know?

2073
03:15:04.78 --> 03:15:12.78
So if you're going to be, so you're Junior Seya, you're playing in the NFL, you got basically unlimited money, right?

2074
03:15:12.78 --> 03:15:14.78
You're living a great city.

2075
03:15:14.78 --> 03:15:17.78
You're famous in the city, you're beloved in the city.

2076
03:15:17.78 --> 03:15:22.78
There's also athletes that are in a city, but they don't like them because whatever, they came from a different team or whatever.

2077
03:15:22.78 --> 03:15:25.78
He's like, beloved in San Diego.

2078
03:15:25.78 --> 03:15:26.78
We're down for Junior Seya.

2079
03:15:26.78 --> 03:15:27.78
Yeah.

2080
03:15:27.78 --> 03:15:30.78
And you take a guy like that and he kills himself.

2081
03:15:30.78 --> 03:15:32.78
I mean, just horrible.

2082
03:15:32.78 --> 03:15:35.78
But more telling, saying straight up, hey, there's something wrong.

2083
03:15:35.78 --> 03:15:38.78
Like this is how much I think something wrong.

2084
03:15:38.78 --> 03:15:46.78
So anyway, the point, and the point there is where that's not a spiraling thought pattern that's just, you know, getting in the way of his like,

2085
03:15:46.78 --> 03:15:53.78
family life, his health, causing him to like, hey, maybe drinking will kind of leave, leave these thoughts and keeping them up at night or whatever.

2086
03:15:53.78 --> 03:15:59.78
Those are like, and that in and of itself is, is can jam you a big time, regardless of where it comes from.

2087
03:15:59.78 --> 03:16:03.78
Can jam you a big time, but it is different than if you have straight up damage to your brain.

2088
03:16:03.78 --> 03:16:05.78
So the treatment is going to be different.

2089
03:16:05.78 --> 03:16:12.78
And by the way, we're going to, you know, we're seeing this now in the special operations community, absolutely in the SEAL community,

2090
03:16:12.78 --> 03:16:19.78
that there's something going on that is damaging guys brains.

2091
03:16:19.78 --> 03:16:22.78
And we heard it from Sarah Wilkinson.

2092
03:16:22.78 --> 03:16:27.78
Her husband, Chad, was not the same guy that she married.

2093
03:16:27.78 --> 03:16:33.78
And it's not like, oh, he's been through some stuff and he's, you know, he's got a different attitude about such and such.

2094
03:16:33.78 --> 03:16:35.78
No, he's a different person.

2095
03:16:35.78 --> 03:16:38.78
And we're, we're seeing that.

2096
03:16:38.78 --> 03:16:48.78
And look, sometimes being a different person maybe means that, you know, I have a worse temper or sometimes being a different person means I'm more focused on something else.

2097
03:16:48.78 --> 03:16:52.78
There's a different level of like, hey, he's a different person now.

2098
03:16:52.78 --> 03:16:57.78
But occasionally, and that's what we're seeing in the SEAL teams and it's freaking awful.

2099
03:16:57.78 --> 03:17:08.78
You've got guys that are getting into these mental places that they absolutely no one expects them to be in.

2100
03:17:08.78 --> 03:17:16.78
And you can't, it, this, the, actually the equivalent of Junior SEAL, beloved SEALs, everybody loves them.

2101
03:17:16.78 --> 03:17:18.78
They have a great career.

2102
03:17:18.78 --> 03:17:21.78
They, they're respected by everybody.

2103
03:17:21.78 --> 03:17:24.78
They're in a great position.

2104
03:17:24.78 --> 03:17:28.78
And we're seeing that outcome.

2105
03:17:28.78 --> 03:17:35.78
And so this, like you're talking about when there's some kind of physical issue with the brain.

2106
03:17:35.78 --> 03:17:42.78
And I don't know what it is, obviously, and actually, unfortunately, no one really knows what it is.

2107
03:17:42.78 --> 03:17:46.78
They haven't been able to say, oh yes, this is what happened to Junior SEAL's brain.

2108
03:17:46.78 --> 03:17:47.78
Here's the impact.

2109
03:17:47.78 --> 03:17:49.78
Here's the nerves that got rattled.

2110
03:17:49.78 --> 03:17:51.78
Here's the reconnections that got made.

2111
03:17:51.78 --> 03:17:53.78
Here's the shortfalls that happened.

2112
03:17:53.78 --> 03:17:54.78
No one said that yet.

2113
03:17:54.78 --> 03:17:58.78
No one said that about SEALs that have taken their own lives.

2114
03:17:58.78 --> 03:17:59.78
Oh, okay.

2115
03:17:59.78 --> 03:18:00.78
Here's the thing.

2116
03:18:00.78 --> 03:18:01.78
Here's what they went through.

2117
03:18:01.78 --> 03:18:02.78
Here's what we need to just stop at.

2118
03:18:02.78 --> 03:18:03.78
No one's saying that.

2119
03:18:03.78 --> 03:18:10.78
But one thing that's happening right now is people are saying, hey, we can't do this anymore.

2120
03:18:10.78 --> 03:18:16.78
We need to identify, we identify the symptom that is guys are killing themselves.

2121
03:18:16.78 --> 03:18:21.78
We got to figure out what's causing it and then figure out how to, how to, how to get that under control.

2122
03:18:21.78 --> 03:18:25.78
I mean, it's absolutely horrific to see this happening.

2123
03:18:25.78 --> 03:18:34.78
So I think what Mama Lee is doing, this intervention with, and like I said, I've seen the impact

2124
03:18:34.78 --> 03:18:40.78
that it's had on guys and she's just continuing to get out there and make this happen.

2125
03:18:40.78 --> 03:18:44.78
And as we talked about, this is Mark Lee.

2126
03:18:44.78 --> 03:18:52.78
Like I said, there's a guy that you think he's given everything, but he's still trying to take care of his teammates.

2127
03:18:52.78 --> 03:18:56.78
Bro, I love looking at stuff like that, like how she would say it.

2128
03:18:56.78 --> 03:18:59.78
And obviously, Mama Lee is a very spiritual person.

2129
03:18:59.78 --> 03:19:02.78
But the idea of like, you know, like you have this war, right?

2130
03:19:02.78 --> 03:19:06.78
You have the bad guys against the good guys and the bad guy takes out a good guy.

2131
03:19:06.78 --> 03:19:08.78
Oh, but did he take out that good guy?

2132
03:19:08.78 --> 03:19:13.78
Not really because the very taking out that good guy kind of spread all this other goodness.

2133
03:19:13.78 --> 03:19:15.78
Kind of went beyond the grave kind of stuff.

2134
03:19:15.78 --> 03:19:17.78
Literally, that's true.

2135
03:19:17.78 --> 03:19:18.78
Actually, factually true.

2136
03:19:18.78 --> 03:19:21.78
And I thought about that too when Ryan Mannion was on.

2137
03:19:21.78 --> 03:19:27.78
I was like, because she said it, she was like, hey, she was like, in a way it was a blessing because I would have never done this and this and this.

2138
03:19:27.78 --> 03:19:30.78
If this terrible thing didn't happen, I was like, oh, that's crazy.

2139
03:19:30.78 --> 03:19:31.78
That's kind of true.

2140
03:19:31.78 --> 03:19:32.78
Or it is true.

2141
03:19:32.78 --> 03:19:33.78
Showing up percent.

2142
03:19:33.78 --> 03:19:37.78
But you know, at the same time, it doesn't change the fact that it's like a tragic loss or whatever,

2143
03:19:37.78 --> 03:19:42.78
but it's like it's spawned like that sacrifice like spawned so many other good things that literally wouldn't happen.

2144
03:19:42.78 --> 03:19:44.78
Wouldn't have got spawned.

2145
03:19:44.78 --> 03:19:45.78
It's crazy.

2146
03:19:45.78 --> 03:19:47.78
Mark continues to give.

2147
03:19:47.78 --> 03:19:48.78
Yup.

2148
03:19:48.78 --> 03:19:53.78
And it's, I wish I could do his personality justice.

2149
03:19:53.78 --> 03:19:54.78
Yeah.

2150
03:19:54.78 --> 03:19:58.78
Because it's just one of a kind, you know.

2151
03:19:58.78 --> 03:20:02.78
So that's what we're doing.

2152
03:20:02.78 --> 03:20:03.78
We're trying to live.

2153
03:20:03.78 --> 03:20:05.78
We're trying to live good lives in order to do that.

2154
03:20:05.78 --> 03:20:06.78
You need some.

2155
03:20:06.78 --> 03:20:08.78
Well, you need some good fuel to be honest with you.

2156
03:20:08.78 --> 03:20:09.78
Good fuel.

2157
03:20:09.78 --> 03:20:10.78
Chocolate fuel.

2158
03:20:10.78 --> 03:20:14.78
Yeah, you need supplements, good supplements, supplements with integrity.

2159
03:20:14.78 --> 03:20:15.78
Yup.

2160
03:20:15.78 --> 03:20:16.78
Yeah.

2161
03:20:16.78 --> 03:20:19.78
100% got some protein called more ready to drink to, by the way.

2162
03:20:19.78 --> 03:20:20.78
Yeah.

2163
03:20:20.78 --> 03:20:21.78
If you didn't know.

2164
03:20:21.78 --> 03:20:23.78
So yeah, you know, I just pounded one.

2165
03:20:23.78 --> 03:20:24.78
Yeah.

2166
03:20:24.78 --> 03:20:29.78
Look, the chocolate one, look, the chocolate one is just straight delicious.

2167
03:20:29.78 --> 03:20:33.78
The vanilla is also delicious.

2168
03:20:33.78 --> 03:20:35.78
You know, gotta give it up for for Keegan.

2169
03:20:35.78 --> 03:20:39.78
Keegan Roberts came up with the perfect description of vanilla is like melted ice cream.

2170
03:20:39.78 --> 03:20:43.78
And bananas, the bananas.

2171
03:20:43.78 --> 03:20:44.78
Yeah.

2172
03:20:44.78 --> 03:20:48.78
So you know what, you know why we, because normally you don't go, normally you don't

2173
03:20:48.78 --> 03:20:50.78
go chocolate, vanilla, banana, right?

2174
03:20:50.78 --> 03:20:51.78
That's not normal.

2175
03:20:51.78 --> 03:20:52.78
What's normal strawberry?

2176
03:20:52.78 --> 03:20:53.78
Maybe strawberry, right?

2177
03:20:53.78 --> 03:20:54.78
Sure.

2178
03:20:54.78 --> 03:20:55.78
Yeah.

2179
03:20:55.78 --> 03:20:56.78
You know why you go banana?

2180
03:20:56.78 --> 03:20:57.78
Because the banana was so freaking good.

2181
03:20:57.78 --> 03:20:58.78
Oh yeah.

2182
03:20:58.78 --> 03:21:00.78
Just start making this banana one.

2183
03:21:00.78 --> 03:21:02.78
Ready to drink, get that stuff.

2184
03:21:02.78 --> 03:21:03.78
Yup.

2185
03:21:03.78 --> 03:21:04.78
Make it happen.

2186
03:21:04.78 --> 03:21:05.78
Yup.

2187
03:21:05.78 --> 03:21:06.78
Don't forget about your joints.

2188
03:21:06.78 --> 03:21:07.78
Big deal.

2189
03:21:07.78 --> 03:21:11.78
Once they go, don't matter how much protein you get, joints don't move.

2190
03:21:11.78 --> 03:21:12.78
Well, it always matters.

2191
03:21:12.78 --> 03:21:15.78
Support your muscles with protein.

2192
03:21:15.78 --> 03:21:17.78
Support your joints with joint warfare.

2193
03:21:17.78 --> 03:21:18.78
Yup.

2194
03:21:18.78 --> 03:21:19.78
It's true.

2195
03:21:19.78 --> 03:21:20.78
Supercrill.

2196
03:21:20.78 --> 03:21:24.78
Supercrill oil in there, vitamin D3 in there, cold war immunity, important as well.

2197
03:21:24.78 --> 03:21:26.78
Especially nowadays, actually not even especially nowadays.

2198
03:21:26.78 --> 03:21:27.78
All the time.

2199
03:21:27.78 --> 03:21:28.78
Community.

2200
03:21:28.78 --> 03:21:29.78
Yeah.

2201
03:21:29.78 --> 03:21:31.78
We're making the best possible products we can.

2202
03:21:31.78 --> 03:21:32.78
Yeah.

2203
03:21:32.78 --> 03:21:34.78
If you go to Wawa, get yourself some drinks.

2204
03:21:34.78 --> 03:21:36.78
If you go to vitamin shop, you can get everything at vitamin shop.

2205
03:21:36.78 --> 03:21:37.78
You can get it.

2206
03:21:37.78 --> 03:21:38.78
Stuff should be at the military commissaries.

2207
03:21:38.78 --> 03:21:41.78
I had somebody reach out the other day and say, wasn't there military commissary?

2208
03:21:41.78 --> 03:21:44.78
Tell the manager, be a Karen.

2209
03:21:44.78 --> 03:21:46.78
Be like, hey, there's no Jocko Fuel here.

2210
03:21:46.78 --> 03:21:47.78
No, I'm just kidding.

2211
03:21:47.78 --> 03:21:52.78
Don't be a Karen, but maybe in a respectful way say, hey, can we get some Jocko Fuel up

2212
03:21:52.78 --> 03:21:53.78
in this piece?

2213
03:21:53.78 --> 03:21:54.78
Yeah.

2214
03:21:54.78 --> 03:21:56.78
Haniford dash stores.

2215
03:21:56.78 --> 03:22:04.78
And look, I got the same message about Haniford, H-E-B, Murphy's, Myers, Meyer.

2216
03:22:04.78 --> 03:22:07.78
Any of these stores, if they don't have Jocko Fuel in stock, let them know.

2217
03:22:07.78 --> 03:22:09.78
Be like, hey, we're looking for that Jocko Fuel.

2218
03:22:09.78 --> 03:22:10.78
Where's it at?

2219
03:22:10.78 --> 03:22:15.78
That way they can help us get the logistics squared away, get more stuff sent to them.

2220
03:22:15.78 --> 03:22:16.78
So there you go.

2221
03:22:16.78 --> 03:22:19.78
Or you go to JockoFuel.com and you can get all this stuff as well.

2222
03:22:19.78 --> 03:22:20.78
Order it, make it happen.

2223
03:22:20.78 --> 03:22:25.78
If you need some jujitsu gear to wear on your body, which you might need rash guards.

2224
03:22:25.78 --> 03:22:29.78
We're not doing the freaking paint creation just going naked.

2225
03:22:29.78 --> 03:22:30.78
No.

2226
03:22:30.78 --> 03:22:31.78
We're not doing that.

2227
03:22:31.78 --> 03:22:32.78
We're not doing that.

2228
03:22:32.78 --> 03:22:33.78
No.

2229
03:22:33.78 --> 03:22:35.78
Sometimes he wants to wear them little sungows, right?

2230
03:22:35.78 --> 03:22:37.78
Yeah, he goes in that direction.

2231
03:22:37.78 --> 03:22:38.78
He leans in that direction.

2232
03:22:38.78 --> 03:22:39.78
He doesn't do it anymore.

2233
03:22:39.78 --> 03:22:41.78
It's freaking horrible when he used to do that.

2234
03:22:41.78 --> 03:22:44.78
If you don't know what a sungow is, it's like a look.

2235
03:22:44.78 --> 03:22:47.78
They're basically like a bikini for a man.

2236
03:22:47.78 --> 03:22:50.78
It is a Brazilian thing, which looks cool, man.

2237
03:22:50.78 --> 03:22:51.78
Nothing against the Brazilian culture.

2238
03:22:51.78 --> 03:22:52.78
That's their culture.

2239
03:22:52.78 --> 03:22:53.78
Yeah, on the beach.

2240
03:22:53.78 --> 03:22:54.78
Yeah, on the beach.

2241
03:22:54.78 --> 03:22:59.78
But when you come into the, on the mats of justice, we don't want it to be the mats

2242
03:22:59.78 --> 03:23:00.78
of just ass, right?

2243
03:23:00.78 --> 03:23:02.78
We want it to be the mats of justice.

2244
03:23:02.78 --> 03:23:04.78
So put some clothes on, right?

2245
03:23:04.78 --> 03:23:08.78
Put some ghee on, put a ghee on, put a rash guard on.

2246
03:23:08.78 --> 03:23:09.78
And we got all that stuff.

2247
03:23:09.78 --> 03:23:10.78
And guess what?

2248
03:23:10.78 --> 03:23:11.78
It's all made in America.

2249
03:23:11.78 --> 03:23:17.78
You know, it's interesting I talking to some people yesterday, they don't even know that

2250
03:23:17.78 --> 03:23:18.78
it's made in America.

2251
03:23:18.78 --> 03:23:21.78
They're like, oh, it's really, it's all made in America.

2252
03:23:21.78 --> 03:23:23.78
Yes, it's 100% made in America.

2253
03:23:23.78 --> 03:23:26.78
That's what one of, that's what makes it awesome.

2254
03:23:26.78 --> 03:23:31.78
Look, if we were making it overseas and it was as high quality as it, that'd be cool.

2255
03:23:31.78 --> 03:23:32.78
Yeah, cool.

2256
03:23:32.78 --> 03:23:36.78
But the next level is made in America.

2257
03:23:36.78 --> 03:23:41.78
So originUSA.com, by the way, we're starting to backfill all that hunt gear.

2258
03:23:41.78 --> 03:23:45.78
So if you needed hunt gear, get on there, order yourself some hunt gear.

2259
03:23:45.78 --> 03:23:46.78
I know.

2260
03:23:46.78 --> 03:23:50.62
Listen, might seem like, oh, hunt season is not for another few months.

2261
03:23:50.62 --> 03:23:53.78
As you know, hunt season sneaks up on you.

2262
03:23:53.78 --> 03:23:55.78
And you're like, dude, I haven't been shooting enough.

2263
03:23:55.78 --> 03:23:57.78
It's gonna sneak up on you.

2264
03:23:57.78 --> 03:23:58.78
Get your hunt gear.

2265
03:23:58.78 --> 03:24:00.78
OriginUSA.com, made in America.

03:24:00.78 --> 03:24:01.78
Yep, it's true.

03:24:01.78 --> 03:24:04.78
Also, Jockle Store, called Jockle Store, is where you can get your Discipline Equals

2268
03:24:04.78 --> 03:24:07.78
Freedom shirts and hats and goodies and stuff.

2269
03:24:07.78 --> 03:24:08.78
Good.

2270
03:24:08.78 --> 03:24:09.78
Represent.

2271
03:24:09.78 --> 03:24:10.78
Represent on the path.

2272
03:24:10.78 --> 03:24:11.78
They were on the path.

2273
03:24:11.78 --> 03:24:13.78
You guys got this, where we have the reset.

2274
03:24:13.78 --> 03:24:14.78
Yep.

2275
03:24:14.78 --> 03:24:15.78
Jockle reset, that's a path.

2276
03:24:15.78 --> 03:24:19.78
It's a path, a program for, it's kind of, is that a competition?

2277
03:24:19.78 --> 03:24:20.78
Would you call it a competition?

2278
03:24:20.78 --> 03:24:22.78
You know what I would say to this?

2279
03:24:22.78 --> 03:24:23.78
It's a reset.

2280
03:24:23.78 --> 03:24:24.78
Yeah.

2281
03:24:24.78 --> 03:24:25.78
That's what it's called.

2282
03:24:25.78 --> 03:24:26.78
That's what it is.

2283
03:24:26.78 --> 03:24:28.78
Discipline Equals Freedom Reset.

2284
03:24:28.78 --> 03:24:30.78
Get yourself back on the path.

2285
03:24:30.78 --> 03:24:31.78
And it's amazing.

2286
03:24:31.78 --> 03:24:32.78
I said this a long time.

2287
03:24:32.78 --> 03:24:34.78
I think I said it to Jordan Peterson a long time ago.

2288
03:24:34.78 --> 03:24:35.78
Sure.

2289
03:24:35.78 --> 03:24:36.78
JP.

2290
03:24:36.78 --> 03:24:38.78
Like, you fix one thing.

2291
03:24:38.78 --> 03:24:42.78
Like you said, if you write down what you're supposed to do tomorrow, tonight, and you

2292
03:24:42.78 --> 03:24:43.78
do it, that's awesome.

2293
03:24:43.78 --> 03:24:45.78
And you had a good day.

2294
03:24:45.78 --> 03:24:47.78
And you made progress in your life.

2295
03:24:47.78 --> 03:24:48.78
Now imagine if you did that for a week.

2296
03:24:48.78 --> 03:24:49.78
Now imagine if you did that for a month.

2297
03:24:49.78 --> 03:24:51.78
Now imagine if you did that for a year.

2298
03:24:51.78 --> 03:24:52.78
Now imagine if you did that for five years.

2299
03:24:52.78 --> 03:24:55.78
Where would you be if you actually did what you were supposed to do?

2300
03:24:55.78 --> 03:24:57.78
That's what the reset's about.

2301
03:24:57.78 --> 03:24:58.78
Okay.

2302
03:24:58.78 --> 03:25:00.78
So it's a in the def reset.com.

2303
03:25:00.78 --> 03:25:03.78
Oh, that's where it's all online.

2304
03:25:03.78 --> 03:25:04.78
Boom.

2305
03:25:04.78 --> 03:25:05.78
Yeah.

2306
03:25:05.78 --> 03:25:06.78
So if you want to represent.

2307
03:25:06.78 --> 03:25:08.78
Speaking of the home.

2308
03:25:08.78 --> 03:25:10.78
Jaco store.com.

2309
03:25:10.78 --> 03:25:12.78
Also, we have a thing called the short lock.

2310
03:25:12.78 --> 03:25:14.78
It's a subscription scenario.

2311
03:25:14.78 --> 03:25:15.78
Get a new shirt every month.

2312
03:25:15.78 --> 03:25:16.78
Different designs.

03:25:16.78 --> 03:25:18.78
People seem to like that one.

2314
03:25:18.78 --> 03:25:19.78
But yeah, check that one out.

2315
03:25:19.78 --> 03:25:20.78
I like the most recent one.

2316
03:25:20.78 --> 03:25:22.78
The no free dopamine.

2317
03:25:22.78 --> 03:25:23.78
No free dopamine.

2318
03:25:23.78 --> 03:25:24.78
No free dopamine.

2319
03:25:24.78 --> 03:25:25.78
That's part of the reset, man.

2320
03:25:25.78 --> 03:25:30.78
Hey, if you're wearing a no free dopamine shirt and you're holding your phone in your

2321
03:25:30.78 --> 03:25:32.78
hand and you're scrolling, you can't do it.

2322
03:25:32.78 --> 03:25:33.78
Yeah.

2323
03:25:33.78 --> 03:25:34.78
You can't do it.

2324
03:25:34.78 --> 03:25:35.78
Hey, you're going to put that away.

2325
03:25:35.78 --> 03:25:36.78
You know it's free dopamine.

2326
03:25:36.78 --> 03:25:37.78
Yeah, exactly right.

2327
03:25:37.78 --> 03:25:38.78
You know it's free dopamine.

2328
03:25:38.78 --> 03:25:39.78
Yeah.

2329
03:25:39.78 --> 03:25:40.78

You may not have known that.

2369
03:27:09.78 --> 03:27:13.78
I didn't do a great job of whatever promoting it.

2370
03:27:13.78 --> 03:27:17.78
Yeah, I'm not talking trash, but yeah, I do a bad job.

2371
03:27:17.78 --> 03:27:22.78
It was not promoted in the way that the other ones work because the other ones I was like, I felt the hype.

2372
03:27:22.78 --> 03:27:23.78
I felt the bill.

2373
03:27:23.78 --> 03:27:24.78
I couldn't wait.

2374
03:27:24.78 --> 03:27:25.78

This was I'm reading it.

2377
03:27:28.78 --> 03:27:33.78
It's just like, you know, when you when you write something and then it takes a while for it to come out, right?

2378
03:27:33.78 --> 03:27:34.78
And then you read it again.

2379
03:27:34.78 --> 03:27:39.78
You're like, yeah, you kind of feel and I've always said this about way of the warrior kid.

2380
03:27:39.78 --> 03:27:44.78
When I read them, I kind of don't feel like I wrote it because it's written in another.

2381
03:27:44.78 --> 03:27:48.78
It's written from the aspect of, you know, a little kid and so I'm reading it.

2382
03:27:48.78 --> 03:27:49.78
I'm like, oh, that's a cool.

2383
03:27:49.78 --> 03:27:51.78

Like Echo is at Echo Charles, don't forget that Echo Charles is Twitter.

2447
03:30:32.78 --> 03:30:35.78
He compromised it.

2448
03:30:35.78 --> 03:30:36.78
That's true.

2449
03:30:36.78 --> 03:30:37.78
Right.

2450
03:30:37.78 --> 03:30:42.78
I was like worried when you're, when your Twitter got, I'll use the term loosely hacked.

2451
03:30:42.78 --> 03:30:43.78
Dang, like this is weird.

2452
03:30:43.78 --> 03:30:46.78
Like how, what kind of, what kind of people are out there?

2453
03:30:46.78 --> 03:30:48.78
What kind of nefarious people are out there?

2454
03:30:48.78 --> 03:30:56.78
I pictured, you know, when you see a mission impossible type movie and the guys show up and they plug in little wires and they're running through a

2455
03:30:56.78 --> 03:30:59.78
program to figure out what the password is.

2456
03:30:59.78 --> 03:31:00.78
Yeah.

2457
03:31:00.78 --> 03:31:07.78
And there's nine people on the radio that are called back to a big mainframe computer to break in and get the password.

2458
03:31:07.78 --> 03:31:08.78
Yeah.

2459
03:31:08.78 --> 03:31:09.78
Sure.

2460
03:31:09.78 --> 03:31:11.78
When you first told me that's what I pictured.

2461
03:31:11.78 --> 03:31:12.78
Okay.

2462
03:31:12.78 --> 03:31:13.78
And then you told me what happened.

2463
03:31:13.78 --> 03:31:14.78
Yeah.

2464
03:31:14.78 --> 03:31:15.78
And I realized you were just dumb.

2465
03:31:15.78 --> 03:31:16.78
Yes.

2466
03:31:16.78 --> 03:31:20.78
I realized you were just dumb and you don't did some dumb shit.

2467
03:31:20.78 --> 03:31:21.78
Yes, sir.

2468
03:31:21.78 --> 03:31:22.78
That's true.

2469
03:31:22.78 --> 03:31:23.78
Hey, living learn.

2470
03:31:23.78 --> 03:31:28.78
Echo gave away his password, lost his thing.

2471
03:31:28.78 --> 03:31:29.78
He got fished.

2472
03:31:29.78 --> 03:31:30.78
Yeah.

2473
03:31:30.78 --> 03:31:31.78
But it's back.

2474
03:31:31.78 --> 03:31:32.78
But it's back.

2475
03:31:32.78 --> 03:31:33.78
Totally back.

2476
03:31:33.78 --> 03:31:34.78
We're back.

2477
03:31:34.78 --> 03:31:35.78
So yeah, if you want to reconnect him.

2478
03:31:35.78 --> 03:31:36.78
Reconnect.

2479
03:31:36.78 --> 03:31:37.78
I mean.

2480
03:31:37.78 --> 03:31:39.78
Echo Charles, he now has 19 followers on Twitter.

2481
03:31:39.78 --> 03:31:40.78
Yep.

2482
03:31:40.78 --> 03:31:42.78
How many did you used to have?

2483
03:31:42.78 --> 03:31:44.78
I appreciate every single one of them.

2484
03:31:44.78 --> 03:31:45.78
Did you know what you used to have?

2485
03:31:45.78 --> 03:31:46.78
Um, yeah.

2486
03:31:46.78 --> 03:31:47.78
50,000?

2487
03:31:47.78 --> 03:31:48.78
Do you have 50,000?

2488
03:31:48.78 --> 03:31:49.78
No, I think it was like 70,000.

2489
03:31:49.78 --> 03:31:50.78
70,000?

2490
03:31:50.78 --> 03:31:51.78
Look at that.

2491
03:31:51.78 --> 03:31:52.78
Sure.

2492
03:31:52.78 --> 03:31:53.78
Do I wonder where you're at?

2493
03:31:53.78 --> 03:31:54.78
71?

2494
03:31:54.78 --> 03:31:55.78
I don't know.

2495
03:31:55.78 --> 03:31:56.78
Yeah.

2496
03:31:56.78 --> 03:31:57.78
We should have made up a better story.

2497
03:31:57.78 --> 03:31:58.78
You know.

2498
03:31:58.78 --> 03:31:59.78
Hey, that's real.

2499
03:31:59.78 --> 03:32:02.78
You know, you should have said I left Twitter because of whatever.

2500
03:32:02.78 --> 03:32:03.78
Oh, my political views.

2501
03:32:03.78 --> 03:32:04.78
Yeah, political views.

2502
03:32:04.78 --> 03:32:05.78
It's something like this.

2503
03:32:05.78 --> 03:32:06.78
Yeah.

2504
03:32:06.78 --> 03:32:07.78

03:32:19.78 --> 03:32:24.78
We could never have asked for a better teammate in your son.

2509
03:32:24.78 --> 03:32:30.78
We could never ask for a better supporter and we could have never asked for a better second

2510
03:32:30.78 --> 03:32:33.10
mom for so many of us.

2511
03:32:33.10 --> 03:32:35.94
So thank you, Mama Lee.

2512
03:32:35.94 --> 03:32:41.98
And thanks to all the military personnel out there and especially a thanks to the military

2513
03:32:41.98 --> 03:32:43.66
families.

2514
03:32:43.66 --> 03:32:44.66
All of you.

2515
03:32:44.66 --> 03:32:52.90
You sacrifice so much for our country when you support your military service member.

2516
03:32:52.90 --> 03:32:54.02
So thank you.

2517
03:32:54.02 --> 03:33:00.18
And then a solemn thanks for the Gold Star families.

2518
03:33:00.18 --> 03:33:07.62
We are forever indebted to what you have given to us.

2519
03:33:07.62 --> 03:33:12.94
And also thanks to our police and law enforcement, our firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2520
03:33:12.94 --> 03:33:17.22
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all the first responders out there

2521
03:33:17.22 --> 03:33:19.62
and your families as well.

2522
03:33:19.62 --> 03:33:27.06
You all keep us safe, but you're able to do your job thanks to the support and sacrifice

2523
03:33:27.06 --> 03:33:28.46
of your families.

2524
03:33:28.46 --> 03:33:33.18
So thanks to our first responders and thanks to your families as well.

2525
03:33:33.18 --> 03:33:37.66
And to everybody else out there.

2526
03:33:37.66 --> 03:33:40.66
Let's think about Mark Lee.

2527
03:33:40.66 --> 03:33:45.14
Let's think about his last letter home.

2528
03:33:45.14 --> 03:33:54.78
And think about that for him to be in combat, to be in danger on a daily basis.

2529
03:33:54.78 --> 03:34:01.90
And what he says in that letter is he asks us to pass on the kindness, the love, the precious

2530
03:34:01.90 --> 03:34:06.10
gift of human life.

2531
03:34:06.10 --> 03:34:08.86
What he wanted us to do was help each other.

2532
03:34:08.86 --> 03:34:15.42
What he wanted us to do was commit more random acts of kindness.

2533
03:34:15.42 --> 03:34:23.70
What he wanted us to do was take less and give more.

2534
03:34:23.70 --> 03:34:31.78
And that's coming from a man who gave everything he had.

2535
03:34:31.78 --> 03:34:33.54
So let's give more.

2536
03:34:33.54 --> 03:34:34.94
Let's do better.

2537
03:34:34.94 --> 03:34:39.06
Let's be better for Mark.

2538
03:34:39.06 --> 03:35:05.90
And until next time, Zeko and Jaco, out.
