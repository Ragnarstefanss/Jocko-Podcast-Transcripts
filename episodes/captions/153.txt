00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.66 This is Jockel Podcasts number 153.
00:00:03.66 --> 00:00:06.30 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.30 --> 00:00:08.30 Good evening echo. Good evening.
00:00:11.30 --> 00:00:19.58 Congressional resolution honoring the veterans of helicopter attack light squadron 3 and their families.
00:00:19.58 --> 00:00:26.14 Whereas helicopter attack light squadron 3 here and after in this resolution referred to as
00:00:26.14 --> 00:00:33.26 Hal3 began its history as detachments of Navy helicopter combat support squadron 1,
00:00:33.26 --> 00:00:39.36 HC1 which began helicopter gun shipped operations in support of Navy,
00:00:39.36 --> 00:00:48.60 Brownwater Special Operations and Army units in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam on September 19, 1966.
00:00:48.60 --> 00:00:54.44 Whereas the detachments of HC1 adopted the name C Wolves.
00:00:54.44 --> 00:01:05.16 Whereas Hal3 was officially established on April 1, 1967 in Vong Tau, South Vietnam and was the only active duty
00:01:05.16 --> 00:01:11.06 Navy helicopter gunship squadron in the history of naval aviation.
00:01:11.06 --> 00:01:24.34 Whereas during the squadron's existence nearly 3,000 veterans of Hal3 displayed extraordinary courage in support of United States military and political objectives in Vietnam.
00:01:24.34 --> 00:01:33.84 Whereas 44 veterans of Hal3 gave their lives in support of military operations in the Mekong Delta Vietnam.
00:01:33.84 --> 00:01:40.30 Whereas the extraordinary performance of the veterans of Hal3 earned numerous unit citations,
00:01:40.30 --> 00:01:44.56 including six presidential unit citations.
00:01:44.56 --> 00:01:52.74 Seven Navy unit commendations, one meritorious unit commendation, a Republic of Vietnam meritorious unit commendation,
00:01:52.74 --> 00:01:57.54 and the Vietnam service medal.
00:01:57.54 --> 00:02:05.84 Whereas the valor of the veterans of Hal3 earned 5 Navy crosses, 31 silver stars,
00:02:05.84 --> 00:02:10.44 2 Legion of Merit medals, 5 Navy Marine Corps medals,
00:02:10.44 --> 00:02:17.74 219 distinguished flying crosses, 156 Purple Hearts, 101 Bronze Stars,
00:02:17.74 --> 00:02:21.44 142 Republic of Vietnam Galantry crosses,
00:02:21.44 --> 00:02:29.64 over 16,000 air medals, 439 Navy commendation medals, and 228 Navy achievement medals,
00:02:29.64 --> 00:02:36.24 making it possible the most decorated Navy squadron during the Vietnam War.
00:02:36.24 --> 00:02:45.74 Whereas the maintenance and administrative personnel of Hal3 contributed greatly to the success of the nine Hal3 detachments operating throughout the Mekong Delta,
00:02:45.74 --> 00:02:52.74 providing the detachments with superb maintenance, support, and logistics.
00:02:52.74 --> 00:02:59.74 Whereas Hal3 flew over 130,000 hours of combat and logistical support,
00:02:59.74 --> 00:03:05.24 whereas Hal3 inflicted several thousand casualties on enemy forces,
00:03:05.24 --> 00:03:12.44 whereas Hal3 performed 1,530 medical evacuations,
00:03:12.44 --> 00:03:21.74 whereas Hal3 delivered over 37,000 passengers and over 1 million pounds of cargo.
00:03:21.74 --> 00:03:29.24 And whereas Hal3 was disestablished in March 1972 at Bing-Thuy South Vietnam,
00:03:29.24 --> 00:03:35.24 as part of the Vietnamization program, leaving behind it a combat and humanitarian record,
00:03:35.24 --> 00:03:40.84 recognizing, recognized as bringing great credit upon the United States Navy,
00:03:40.84 --> 00:03:43.64 and its role in a Vietnam War.
00:03:43.64 --> 00:03:50.34 Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives won,
00:03:50.34 --> 00:03:55.64 honors the service, courage, and sacrifice of the veterans of Hal3,
00:03:55.64 --> 00:04:00.84 two honors the families of Hal3 veterans for their support,
00:04:00.84 --> 00:04:08.04 three expresses its condolences to the families and comrades of those killed in action.
00:04:08.04 --> 00:04:16.84 And four, recognizes Hal3 as a unique squadron in the history of naval aviation.
00:04:16.84 --> 00:04:32.44 And that resolution of recognition was made in 2010, actually 38 years after the sea wolves were
00:04:32.44 --> 00:04:42.84 disestablished in Vietnam. And that is a long time to wait for recognition.
00:04:42.84 --> 00:04:47.64 And this is because, well, for one thing, they weren't looking for recognition,
00:04:47.64 --> 00:04:56.04 but also to much of the world, the sea wolves were relatively unknown.
00:04:56.04 --> 00:05:02.04 For me, having grown up in the sea of teams, I actually knew about the sea wolves.
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:11.64 I knew about the reputation from the Vietnam era seals that held them in the absolute highest regard.
00:05:11.64 --> 00:05:18.04 Possibly. Then they were considered extremely courageous.
00:05:18.04 --> 00:05:27.08 Sometimes beyond courageous, they were incredible pilots and highly aggressive gunners,
00:05:27.08 --> 00:05:33.08 and the teams that maintained and kept the aircraft flying in really horrible conditions,
00:05:33.08 --> 00:05:37.64 they were known for getting the job done. And there's one thing that always stuck in my mind
00:05:37.64 --> 00:05:45.40 when I heard stories about the sea wolves in Vietnam. And that was this. Simply, if you called them,
00:05:47.64 --> 00:05:51.88 they would come. And it didn't matter if it was day or night.
00:05:51.88 --> 00:05:59.80 Sunny skies or typhoon rains, a calm extraction or a hot landing zone filled with enemy fire
00:05:59.80 --> 00:06:07.24 to the sea wolves, none of that mattered. What mattered is that the troops on the ground needed help.
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:18.28 And if you called the sea wolves, they would come. And it is an honor today to have one of these
00:06:18.28 --> 00:06:26.12 men here with us to tell us about this relatively unknown, but at the same time, legendary
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:35.40 squadron of naval aviation, helicopter attack squadron, light, Halthry, the sea wolves. And we have
00:06:35.40 --> 00:06:42.52 Dennis Rally, Naval Officer, Naval Aviator, and of course, Sea Wolf.
00:06:42.52 --> 00:06:47.48 Sir, absolutely honored to have you on the show. Thank you for coming.
00:06:48.60 --> 00:06:56.04 Jackal, I thank you, and you echo, for the opportunity to be here. It's something that I didn't
00:06:56.04 --> 00:07:04.04 want to do. You know, you hear the old saw about, you don't talk about the war. And I think that's
00:07:04.04 --> 00:07:09.16 true of most all of the guys that I knew and flew in thought with. We just don't talk about it
00:07:09.16 --> 00:07:16.12 except over a beer in a bar somewhere with that. Guys, we've trusted our lives too.
00:07:17.64 --> 00:07:25.24 However, my wife, Stinky, and my son and daughter, when they heard about this opportunity told me
00:07:25.24 --> 00:07:33.56 you got to do this. You got to help keep the reputation of the sea wolves alive. And I don't think
00:07:33.56 --> 00:07:41.72 that reputation needs a lot of build up on my part. But I'm here to honor the 44 of our brothers
00:07:42.52 --> 00:07:49.16 who were able to come on back with us. And I'm here to help share a little bit of history about the
00:07:49.16 --> 00:07:57.56 squadron. And I'm here to thank everyone of you Swing and Dick Gunners who helped me get my little pink
00:07:57.56 --> 00:08:03.96 body back without any additional holes in it. Those guys are phenomenal. I mean, they're really
00:08:03.96 --> 00:08:09.64 something. But we'll get into that. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm looking forward to the conversation.
00:08:10.68 --> 00:08:17.80 I'm still scratching my head is to why I'm here because you guys have giant saw this show.
00:08:17.80 --> 00:08:27.96 You just had a fella who was a highly decorated marine infrety officer. He went on to get a
00:08:27.96 --> 00:08:34.60 lot of degree. He went on to work in the VA. He became the secretary of the Navy. He became a
00:08:34.60 --> 00:08:41.000 congressman from the great state of Virginia. And oh, by the way, it was a little known candidate
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.28 for President of the US. And party politics aside, this country would have been better off
00:08:46.28 --> 00:08:52.36 if Jim Webb had been our president. Totally agree. Yeah. And I can say that not from, you know,
00:08:52.36 --> 00:08:58.92 just a casual reading of his bio. I know Jim because it was a class made of mine at the Naval Academy.
00:08:59.96 --> 00:09:07.48 I know Jim because it was a company made of mine at the Naval Academy. And I know Jim to be the
00:09:07.48 --> 00:09:16.28 kind of a man that I would hope my son would become just a great guy. I can also say that I know Jim
00:09:16.28 --> 00:09:21.80 because for a brief time, plebes summer, we run together. So you're looking at one of the only guys
00:09:21.80 --> 00:09:26.28 that you'll ever meet who is proud to share the fact that he slept with the secretary of the Navy.
00:09:29.80 --> 00:09:36.92 So yeah, we're here to spread the word and have a little fun. The one thing that was really
00:09:36.92 --> 00:09:43.88 important about recent past is a sea wool for union. We have reunions every every couple of years.
00:09:43.88 --> 00:09:50.04 And now many reunions more frequently. But this one was pretty special. It was about two months ago.
00:09:50.04 --> 00:09:57.96 We were gathered on the flight deck of the midway for the premier of a documentary called Scramble
00:09:57.96 --> 00:10:02.28 the Sea Wolves. They had a big inflatable screen on the flight deck. And we were all up there
00:10:02.28 --> 00:10:09.72 laughing and scratching. One thing that I noticed about the entire experience is Manov's
00:10:09.72 --> 00:10:22.20 guys look old. I mean, yeah. But the documentary was very well shot. It's actually being released on
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.80 KPS and PBS. And I assume that shortly after that will be available on YouTube. But it gave us a sense
00:10:31.80 --> 00:10:38.52 of pride. And I think I can speak for everyone that it gave us a little greater sense of belonging
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:43.96 based upon the fact that our story could now be told.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.96 Yeah, no, that's a, I've watched it. Anybody can watch it. You can, if you Google Scramble the Sea Wolves
00:10:49.96 --> 00:10:55.80 KPS, the it'll pop up and you can watch it. Just, you know, there's no email to sign up for
00:10:55.80 --> 00:11:01.96 it's free. That's how you can, you can watch it. Let's, let's talk about the sea. Well, let's
00:11:01.96 --> 00:11:07.16 talk a little bit about your past because I think you're, I mean, starting with your, your dad
00:11:07.96 --> 00:11:12.68 being a pilot. And now let's start with that and what that was like growing up.
00:11:13.24 --> 00:11:17.96 Well, my dad would really be pissed off at you for calling them a pilot because dad was an aviation
00:11:17.96 --> 00:11:24.36 or an insurance. And he knew that the guys in the back were doing the job and the guys up front
00:11:24.36 --> 00:11:32.04 were just a steer in the bus. No, my dad William John Raleigh was a hell of a guy. He was an
00:11:32.04 --> 00:11:37.56 interesting man. And that's a nice thing you can say about somebody, I think. Dad was a kind of a guy
00:11:37.56 --> 00:11:43.80 who could walk into a room and full of strangers and an hour later walk out and everybody thought
00:11:43.80 --> 00:11:51.56 to his or new best friend. Good guy, great guy. But he comes from a long line of warriors, my grandfather
00:11:51.56 --> 00:11:59.16 who married my grandmother from Hilo. Yeah, he, he thought in the World War I, I have a wonderful
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:06.68 picture at home of my mom and her three brothers taken during World War II. And Uncle Walt is there
00:12:06.68 --> 00:12:13.16 in his Marine Corps uniform. Uncle Bob is there in his Navy Blues. And my uncle Jim is there
00:12:13.88 --> 00:12:21.48 in his Army Air Force uniform. Yeah. And then when World War II broke out, my dad and his
00:12:21.48 --> 00:12:28.68 brother, my uncle herb, both joined the Navy. Dad went on in the aviation ordinance and came out
00:12:28.68 --> 00:12:33.80 the other end of the the pipe after peace is one of the last of the Tojo chiefs, a guy who made
00:12:33.80 --> 00:12:43.08 chief in little over three years. He's an interesting fellow. And leadership lesson number one for me
00:12:43.08 --> 00:12:51.08 was the way he helped me grow as I was coming up. You would think that a chief buddy officer
00:12:51.08 --> 00:12:56.52 in the Navy can be very gruff and directive. And they, they can and they are when it's required.
00:12:57.24 --> 00:13:05.48 But dad never told me, go do this. He'd say, have you ever considered, have you ever thought about
00:13:06.04 --> 00:13:13.000 have you ever? And he brought it into practice one day when I was just getting ready for college
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.96 and trying to decide where I was going to go. He had just come back from a mid-cruise and he had
00:13:19.96 --> 00:13:26.60 one of his jails, a pilot, a naval academy grad, inviting me over to his house for dinner.
00:13:27.16 --> 00:13:32.52 I thought that was a little strange, but I was pretty excited about it. The guy came and picked me
00:13:32.52 --> 00:13:39.96 up in a brand new yellow Corvette and took me over to his home and introduced me to his drop dead
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:45.32 gorgeous Swedish wife. Now dad didn't have to say, you should go to the naval academy for the
00:13:45.32 --> 00:13:50.52 experience in learning leadership. He brought it down to a level that I could understand.
00:13:50.52 --> 00:13:52.76 Yeah, you'd get issued a Swedish wife.
00:13:54.76 --> 00:13:58.92 Well actually what I want to jocco was somebody five, five, nine long straight blonde here,
00:13:58.92 --> 00:14:03.48 good-head bitch and bod. What he completely intelligent and, uh,
00:14:03.48 --> 00:14:08.44 in-beued with a mating instincts of a wild mink and heat. But what the good lords off it to
00:14:08.44 --> 00:14:12.28 pyramy up with was stinky and she's a stumpy little brown here. You're all that's just
00:14:12.28 --> 00:14:17.16 ordinary as a sack of wild cats. So yeah, he needed funny hell at all works out.
00:14:19.72 --> 00:14:25.80 So so you you go meet this pilot and did that, did that flip the switch in your head?
00:14:25.80 --> 00:14:32.84 Well, I always knew I wanted to be a naval aviator. It's just something that I wanted.
00:14:33.40 --> 00:14:39.16 I had initially had dreams of going in and flying spads. That day,
00:14:39.16 --> 00:14:45.32 a one was just a hell of a weapon scarier in that closer support mission that was non-parallel
00:14:45.32 --> 00:14:51.72 in my way of thinking. They got a lot of guys out of the ship. But that didn't work out because
00:14:51.72 --> 00:14:58.60 aircraft was being retired as I was going through flight school. The thought of going to the
00:14:58.60 --> 00:15:02.84 naval academy was always intriguing to me. I didn't know that I'd be able to make that.
00:15:02.84 --> 00:15:07.72 But I was one of the, you know, I'm sort of large. And I was one of the only navy
00:15:09.80 --> 00:15:15.64 dependence who were in the athletics in Kubisaki High School on Okinawa,
00:15:15.64 --> 00:15:21.72 where I went through all four years of high school. And the senior naval officer on the island
00:15:21.72 --> 00:15:29.000 had roomed with Wayne Harden, the football coach at Navy. They did a quick scout and told me to take
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.64 a competitive exam and I'd be considered for the academy. I had a year to waste.
00:15:38.36 --> 00:15:44.76 Well, I was waiting to get into the academy. So I went to Berkeley. This is in the 1963-64 school year,
00:15:44.76 --> 00:15:51.40 which was very colorful. Mario Yoselvo was up there doing his dirty word movement on the steps
00:15:51.40 --> 00:15:56.52 of the administration business. It was ugly. My parents lived across the hill in Walnut Creek,
00:15:56.52 --> 00:16:03.08 California, and every time the news was over, I'd get a frantic call from my mother. Are you okay?
00:16:03.08 --> 00:16:09.40 You're okay? Yeah, my mom. I'm okay. Yeah. But it didn't rate to following that year at Berkeley.
00:16:10.20 --> 00:16:15.72 Every seat of presidential appointment. And even though he had been assassinated,
00:16:17.16 --> 00:16:23.96 John Kennedy signatures was on that. Yeah. And I went back to the to the to Navy,
00:16:23.96 --> 00:16:31.80 fell in love with crew, and I can honestly say that if it hadn't been for rowing at Navy,
00:16:32.36 --> 00:16:37.16 I probably wouldn't have made it through. I probably would have quit, which is something that you
00:16:37.16 --> 00:16:42.12 would have been pissed off about. I would have been. Yeah. And why is that? Because it gave you something
00:16:42.12 --> 00:16:50.68 to focus on, it gave you an outlet. Exactly. Crew is hands down the the greatest team sport
00:16:50.68 --> 00:16:57.56 that you can imagine. If even one person is not pulling their weight, is not exactly in
00:16:57.56 --> 00:17:05.40 sync. The rhythm of the boat suffers. It'll be dragged down. And everyone will know exactly
00:17:05.96 --> 00:17:13.08 the reason for that. You can tell by the size of the puddle, the way the boat is set. It's phenomenal.
00:17:13.08 --> 00:17:20.52 So it's a great lesson in group leadership and that everyone has to be a leader in that shell
00:17:21.16 --> 00:17:27.32 to put their their the maximum that they can into it to make the boat move. If you get a chance
00:17:27.32 --> 00:17:33.96 for you to book called the boys in the boat. It's a great insight into what ruins all about. And
00:17:33.96 --> 00:17:44.12 you guys should be up on other sports. And so you you row at the Naval Academy. How is your
00:17:44.12 --> 00:17:48.36 how is your since you kind of grew up in the Navy, your dad was a chief. You must have been at
00:17:48.36 --> 00:17:53.64 least somewhat prepared for the you know the shock and awe of children's structures and
00:17:53.64 --> 00:18:01.80 upper classmen and all that stuff. It wasn't the the drilling structures or the the upper classman.
00:18:01.80 --> 00:18:09.96 It was the chicken ship. I had a guy and our company that just hated me and he'd stand me up in
00:18:09.96 --> 00:18:16.44 the passageway and they had a plastic baseball bat and beat me in the chest with it. Yeah, it's a
00:18:16.44 --> 00:18:23.32 non-event, you know, funk funk funk. But if I saw that guy again, I would grip his head off
00:18:24.04 --> 00:18:28.12 because it was just so juvenile. I was a couple of years older than my classmates for a number of
00:18:28.12 --> 00:18:34.44 reasons I flunked again to garden. But at any rate it was a yeah you just don't do things like that.
00:18:34.44 --> 00:18:40.44 There's no there's no leadership lessons there's no benefit to be had from some of the stuff
00:18:40.44 --> 00:18:45.24 that was going on in there. But when I got out there on the water with my teammates, you know,
00:18:45.24 --> 00:18:52.36 it all just went away. Yeah, there's something to be learned from having to put up with such crap.
00:18:52.36 --> 00:18:57.16 And I think there's two ways people go with it. Sometimes they go with like, oh, I'm going to be
00:18:57.16 --> 00:19:02.20 able to do that one day and give people a bunch of shit about whatever and some people go, okay,
00:19:02.20 --> 00:19:11.000 I'm never going to act like that. Yeah, you know. Yeah. And then how and and so you were Jim
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000 Web's roommate, pleaps summer. Just for a few days, but we were in the same company for all four
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.32 years. Yeah. And then he's a heck of a guy. Yeah. Oh, no, it was awesome. It was a real honor to have him
00:19:23.32 --> 00:19:29.16 on here. And you know, he he told a similar story. And he wrote about it in some of his books, which was,
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:34.68 you know, a guy just smack him in the ass with some kind of bat. It was our song book.
00:19:35.96 --> 00:19:40.36 And and their telling him he needs to say, you know, just admit that it hurts and he wouldn't admit it.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.48 But same thing, you know, he's like, he, he, he, what do you say? He said, you know, I don't
00:19:45.48 --> 00:19:49.40 hold anything against those guys that did that to me, but I remember the names.
00:19:49.40 --> 00:19:57.80 Yeah. So I think they made the list for Jim Web. Yeah. Um, and then how did you end up pick it?
00:19:57.80 --> 00:20:04.28 So you, you already automatically knew you wanted to be a pilot. Absolutely. And was that hard to get selected
00:20:04.28 --> 00:20:12.92 for that? Um, no, it was a service election is done based on class rank. And I graduated in the top 10
00:20:12.92 --> 00:20:17.88 percent of the bottom third of my class. And that was sufficient to get me into the aviation.
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:24.12 And since I couldn't fly this path, I really wanted to go jets. Sorry guys. I have to admit that.
00:20:24.12 --> 00:20:30.36 But due to, due to my size, and my anthropometric measurements, if I had to punch out,
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:35.000 I would have left my knees on the glursile of the trainers that I had to tell you.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.20 That's six four. Yeah. Big. Um, this was, you know, clearly in Jim Web talked about this one.
00:20:42.20 --> 00:20:47.08 He was on the podcast. You know, he's, he was the guy in charge of hanging up the names of the guys
00:20:47.08 --> 00:20:53.88 that have been killed. And, and yet when I had Charlie Plum on who graduated, I think in 64, or he showed
00:20:53.88 --> 00:21:01.16 up in 64, no graduated 64. Vietnam wasn't even on the on the radar. That's right. For them.
00:21:01.80 --> 00:21:09.48 And for you guys, it, you know, 1967, 1968, it had, you know, you had to have known. Okay, I'm going
00:21:09.48 --> 00:21:15.88 to fight in Vietnam. When you walk into Mother B, bankrupt hall, you go into the Routunda,
00:21:15.88 --> 00:21:23.000 which is a very large open area. And when we started losing our former classmates, the graduates,
00:21:24.44 --> 00:21:30.84 I'm sure Jim explained, but you put a poster board up there with the picture out of the lucky bag,
00:21:30.84 --> 00:21:40.52 and a brief bio and not a description, but where they died. And initially, it was just one of these
00:21:40.52 --> 00:21:45.40 twosies, but pretty soon that the March went all the way around the Routunda, and they had to move it
00:21:45.40 --> 00:21:55.40 up into Memorial Hall. And it really brought home the fact that this is, this is serious. This is,
00:21:55.40 --> 00:22:01.48 you know, you're making up your minds, whether or not you wanted to dedicate your lives
00:22:01.48 --> 00:22:06.84 that the defense of this country, and it might come at a considerable cost. And for 44 of our
00:22:06.84 --> 00:22:15.56 brothers, it certainly did. 44 C Wolves didn't make it back. And I'm sort of an emotional guy
00:22:16.60 --> 00:22:25.96 that one of the few times that I've really cried, openly and then I shame itly,
00:22:25.96 --> 00:22:36.68 was it the wall? So you know, seeing a couple of my gunners up there, just really brought it home to me.
00:22:39.08 --> 00:22:50.04 Amazing people, gunners are. So that's what you know you're getting into upon commissioning.
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:58.68 And so you get commissioned and you graduate in 68, your classes 68, right? And then you go to
00:22:58.68 --> 00:23:06.44 Pensacola Florida. Is that where you go to flight school? That's right. And that's what you
00:23:06.44 --> 00:23:11.72 talk us a little bit through the flight school path. You show up, you learn to fly what a T-38.
00:23:12.44 --> 00:23:19.40 Is that what you learn on? No, you start out on a T-34. And there's, there's been a change in the
00:23:19.40 --> 00:23:25.08 way they, the Instruct Naval Aviators now. When we were going through, you had to do the flight,
00:23:25.08 --> 00:23:31.000 the fixed wing flight syllabus first before you could get into helicopters. And then you go through
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.60 the helicopter, uh, syllabus. And then after that, those of us that got orders to uh, Vietnam,
00:23:38.60 --> 00:23:46.68 would go up to a Fort Rucker. And the Army would, uh, instruct us in tactics in, uh, uh,
00:23:46.68 --> 00:23:53.56 armament systems, uh, they did, they did a good job in propiness. And then send us overseas
00:23:53.56 --> 00:23:59.40 in the rest of it would be done in country. So the, the training that we received along the way
00:24:00.12 --> 00:24:06.52 was, uh, was excellent. But, uh, a lot of it was just like, uh, back at the Academy, they told us
00:24:06.52 --> 00:24:11.16 that, uh, hey guys, the education you receive here at the United States Naval Academy,
00:24:11.16 --> 00:24:18.20 caused the taxpayer approximately $250,000, which was a lot of money back then. And our reply
00:24:18.20 --> 00:24:24.84 was, yeah, but you stick it up our butts in nickel at a time. So, you know, you know,
00:24:24.84 --> 00:24:29.80 had you, so now you're in the pipeline for for helicopters. Had you heard of,
00:24:30.60 --> 00:24:34.28 see, what's at this time? Were, were you hearing about it? Did, is it something that you said,
00:24:34.28 --> 00:24:39.000 oh, I want to go do that? We were just starting to hear about it. And you know, it wasn't, uh,
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.92 that fully developed in my mind. It, uh, that's, uh, where I wanted to go, but it, it quickly became,
00:24:50.04 --> 00:24:58.76 there is a purpose for every element in the military, from the guys who swabs the decks all the
00:24:58.76 --> 00:25:04.68 way on up. But I didn't want to be a bus driver. I didn't want to be a guy who board holes in the
00:25:04.68 --> 00:25:13.96 sky. So, this being a seawolf immediately appealed to me as an opportunity to be able to,
00:25:16.12 --> 00:25:21.80 I don't know, to pay back. It's, it's a funny thing. And I'll jump ahead a little here.
00:25:22.76 --> 00:25:30.04 But, uh, I have a cousin, uh, who is very close to me. She's a like a sister to me.
00:25:30.04 --> 00:25:37.16 And I'd never really thought about questions like you just asked, but after immediately after I got
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:43.56 back from Vietnam, she was driving me on out to family home in Wallet Creek, California. And without
00:25:43.56 --> 00:25:50.20 taking her eyes off the road, she said, how can you do it? And I thought about that for just a minute
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:55.24 and said, well, it was pretty easy. I want to over there to bring as many of our guys home safely as I
00:25:55.24 --> 00:26:05.000 could. And in some ways I failed, in some ways I succeeded. But that's it. I was enough of a student
00:26:06.44 --> 00:26:15.48 to understand the domino effect certainly. But that wasn't in my thinking. You know, you're thinking
00:26:15.48 --> 00:26:23.72 sort of, ten yards, ten yards. But in the air, it's a little more expansive. It's, it's the
00:26:23.72 --> 00:26:28.44 guys that you're flying with. The guys in your flat fire team, the guys on your deck, the guys who were
00:26:28.44 --> 00:26:34.20 the maintainers back in, uh, been to me. They're the, uh, they're the guys you think about. And that's why you do it.
00:26:36.76 --> 00:26:41.96 Okay. So, did you get to select? You get done with, um, you get done with the training. Did you get to
00:26:41.96 --> 00:26:48.04 select? Hey, I want to go to the squadron of Vietnam. Uh, pretty much yes. They, they, was there a long
00:26:48.04 --> 00:26:53.40 list for that. They were, they were. They were, they were more volunteers than, uh, then, uh, got
00:26:53.40 --> 00:26:59.64 to sell. I don't know the mechanics of that. I asked where had I got it? And how did that look like
00:26:59.64 --> 00:27:11.32 showing up in Vietnam? I was the, uh, only officer assigned to the C wolves who, uh, took that, uh, reverse
00:27:11.32 --> 00:27:17.56 freedom flight on and disay gone. And I got there and they shuffled me off to the Anapolis Hotel,
00:27:17.56 --> 00:27:24.60 which I thought was a little unusual. But, uh, uh, you know, I had a couple of days to kill because
00:27:24.60 --> 00:27:31.48 there wasn't any transport down to, uh, to Ben and Tui. And I knew, uh, uh, a deer friend of mine,
00:27:32.12 --> 00:27:38.28 who is at, uh, in debt to it, not Bay. And he'd got over the before I did. So, I figured not Bay. That's
00:27:38.28 --> 00:27:43.88 not too far away. I'm going to go visit him. And the next morning, I, uh, check out a 45 put it in my
00:27:43.88 --> 00:27:51.56 gym bag. I'm in civies. They didn't like us roaming around town in onesies, uh, in uniform. So I, uh,
00:27:51.56 --> 00:27:56.68 jumped on a Navy bus out to Nabe. I was having a great time talking to guys at the debt there and
00:27:56.68 --> 00:28:04.92 learn a little about what's going on. And, uh, come stymed to leave. And it's probably about 1630.
00:28:04.92 --> 00:28:10.92 And I say, well, I better get back. And they say, well, you just missed the last bus. But don't worry
00:28:10.92 --> 00:28:19.64 about it. You can take a petty cab. So here I am, uh, brand new in country. I've got the zipper in my, uh,
00:28:19.64 --> 00:28:26.12 on a gym bag open with my hand very close to it. And this, uh, the Vietnamese fellow is peddling away,
00:28:26.12 --> 00:28:31.000 taking me back to the, uh, the hotel. It took us about an hour to get back there. And, uh, I
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.04 jumped him generously because I'm not, uh, light fellow. I was a lot lighter than. But, uh, you know,
00:28:36.04 --> 00:28:44.20 here I am. My first day in country, and I'm going to get greased. So yeah. It tells us, uh, if you wouldn't
00:28:44.20 --> 00:28:49.48 mind, um, some of the, about the formation of the sea wolves, because it's, it's a very cool story
00:28:49.48 --> 00:28:56.68 about the maycon delta, about the way things, the way the enemy moved through the maycon delta
00:28:56.68 --> 00:29:00.20 and through the rung sat special zone. And there was no roads in the only way to get around
00:29:00.20 --> 00:29:04.76 this water. If you want to, maybe expand on that, just so people can kind of get a feel for,
00:29:04.76 --> 00:29:11.48 for what started this whole thing off. Sure. Sure. The, uh, uh, the mecon delta is fed by a, uh,
00:29:11.48 --> 00:29:20.76 waters from the Himalayas. It comes on down and, uh, spreads out into a broad, uh, quasi-oceanic area.
00:29:20.76 --> 00:29:27.88 Basically, it's mud and crap and brown water. And, uh, hence the brown water navy, but it
00:29:27.88 --> 00:29:36.04 didn't irritate. The, uh, there are very few roads that do anything but connect major cities in the
00:29:36.04 --> 00:29:43.88 mecon, uh, back then. And consequently, uh, it's just about all the traffic's moved by, uh, the
00:29:43.88 --> 00:29:53.88 sand pan, uh, or, uh, or junk. And that's the way people got around. The, uh, infiltration that
00:29:53.88 --> 00:30:05.56 the, uh, the, uh, the VC, uh, practice, came my largely either on foot by bicycle or by boat.
00:30:06.60 --> 00:30:13.88 In order to, uh, counteract that, uh, task force. So, uh, one, one six, uh, was, uh, put into place
00:30:13.88 --> 00:30:21.08 game warden was the, uh, the operational mission. And we were there to interject that traffic in personnel,
00:30:21.08 --> 00:30:26.68 ammunition and, uh, food logistics that was moving down into the Delta.
00:30:28.28 --> 00:30:35.08 The, uh, Army had took that mission on first, actually flying off a couple of, uh, uh, LCDs,
00:30:35.08 --> 00:30:41.80 uh, that were, uh, rigged with a, uh, makeshift flight tech. But, uh, that didn't work out too well.
00:30:41.80 --> 00:30:49.000 And, uh, this is not saying anything against the Army, but, uh, in their syllabus, they weren't trained
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.08 on instruments. In Navy, we were rigorously first in, uh, fixed wing and then in helicopters.
00:30:55.40 --> 00:31:01.72 So we were used to flying in the ship and the Navy, uh, and the Army was not. And, and that's,
00:31:01.72 --> 00:31:07.08 that's because the Navy has to fly at sea land on, on boat, on ships. That's right,
00:31:07.08 --> 00:31:12.60 different missions. That's it. Different missions at the time. The, uh, the Army, uh, uh, uh,
00:31:12.60 --> 00:31:16.84 outrew that, but it was, it was painful. They had it had a different mission than we did.
00:31:16.84 --> 00:31:24.44 So, uh, they, uh, uh, they, they had a unit that was assigned to our op-con.
00:31:25.16 --> 00:31:30.36 And they would fly, uh, cover for, uh, for the, uh, small boats. Uh, that was, we're, we're,
00:31:30.36 --> 00:31:35.72 primarily the, uh, PBRs and the swift boats. We didn't see many swift boats up at Benluck.
00:31:36.28 --> 00:31:43.32 Uh, we were working with a P.A.B.R. sailors. Uh, PBR patrol boat river is a 32 foot fiberglass
00:31:43.32 --> 00:31:52.76 luxury boat that was stripped clean and, uh, was highly maneuverable. But it was, uh, I say,
00:31:52.76 --> 00:31:59.80 stripped clean, everything that was non-essential. They were very lightweight, uh, had, uh,
00:31:59.80 --> 00:32:04.76 little armor at all, but they were very heavily armed. And these boats, uh,
00:32:04.76 --> 00:32:12.44 you talk about guys with, uh, brass balls. They'd poke up into, uh, these impossibly narrow
00:32:12.44 --> 00:32:19.32 canals and up, uh, little riverlets, uh, just looking for trouble. And it frequently came their way.
00:32:20.20 --> 00:32:25.56 So the army was, uh, uh, uh, a, uh, a, a, a temp into a work with them there, where all sorts of, uh,
00:32:25.56 --> 00:32:31.48 a minor operational, uh, problemist overcome, uh, who's calling out the missions, uh, uh, uh,
00:32:31.48 --> 00:32:37.96 what, uh, the support area is, it's just wasn't working well. So the Navy decided that, uh,
00:32:37.96 --> 00:32:48.44 we needed a Navy squadron and they turned to HC1, the fleet angels, uh, to put, put a few deaths in place,
00:32:48.44 --> 00:32:53.64 to help provide cover for the, uh, the brown water navy and by brown water navy, I mean the,
00:32:53.64 --> 00:33:00.60 uh, small boat guys, the seals, any Navy, navy, uh, uh, uh, vessel that was down in the, uh, in the,
00:33:00.60 --> 00:33:09.24 in the me column. And, uh, it wasn't working well with the, uh, the army HC1 picked it up,
00:33:09.24 --> 00:33:16.12 but started working very well, uh, because they understood the Navy's mission much better than the army,
00:33:16.12 --> 00:33:23.08 and they were, uh, equipped with the, uh, capabilities to fly both at night and in bad weather.
00:33:23.08 --> 00:33:30.44 And, uh, I don't know if you've been in monsoon before, but it's shitty fluttering.
00:33:31.48 --> 00:33:39.48 It is pretty worth it. It's really bad. So, uh, as you've already mentioned, on April Fool's Day,
00:33:39.48 --> 00:33:47.000 in uh, 67, uh, they decided that the, uh, in country squadron was, uh, required and, uh, that
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.20 responsibility was shifted from HC1 to Hal-3. Uh, we grew to having nine, nine detachments,
00:33:55.24 --> 00:34:00.76 uh, that were scattered throughout the Delta to, uh, give us a quick reaction time to virtually,
00:34:00.76 --> 00:34:07.64 uh, any, any area in the me column. And, uh, each detachment had, uh, two aircraft assigned.
00:34:07.64 --> 00:34:15.000 It had, uh, uh, two full crews for each aircraft, and that was about it. But let me, let me give you a
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.48 little info on, uh, the noble UH1 Bravo. I love that aircraft. It was a piece of crap.
00:34:24.52 --> 00:34:30.44 It really was, but it, uh, got us out of, uh, out of a lot of trouble every time we flew it.
00:34:30.44 --> 00:34:37.08 And just for people that are listening, that's the classic Vietnam Huey aircraft. That's, that's what
00:34:37.08 --> 00:34:43.48 you see. That's what you see in movies. That's it. Yeah. There really was sort of a, uh,
00:34:43.48 --> 00:34:52.92 Michaels Navy, uh, that, uh, K, K, K, K, that was attached to the sea wolves. Uh, the, the army was just
00:34:52.92 --> 00:34:58.12 getting rid of their Bravo models to go to this, uh, two of the Charlie's, which had, uh, several
00:34:58.12 --> 00:35:04.20 hundred, uh, greater horsepower, a more maneuverable, a blah, blah, blah, and they had, uh, some old
00:35:04.20 --> 00:35:09.16 Bravo sitting around and rather than shipping them back to the Boneyard or destroying them in place,
00:35:09.16 --> 00:35:14.84 they gave them to the Navy. So frequently, we had a lot of rebuilding to do before, uh, we, uh,
00:35:14.84 --> 00:35:20.84 turn these guys loose, but God bless the army. They gave us, uh, the, they gave us our, uh, our aircraft.
00:35:23.32 --> 00:35:30.76 Support for the Bravo and the Navy chain was not the best. So you've, uh, it's easy to say
00:35:30.76 --> 00:35:38.36 begbar or steal, uh, borrowers steal is what we did quite well. Quite well. Our guys were
00:35:38.36 --> 00:35:44.52 incredible. We, uh, achieved grab a couple of guys and go out and come back with exactly what we
00:35:44.52 --> 00:35:53.32 needed. And you don't ask a question about that. You, you just put it into play. Uh, so, uh, the, uh,
00:35:53.32 --> 00:35:59.40 the nine deaths to helicopters in each, uh, each, uh, Huey was, uh, basically configured with two
00:35:59.40 --> 00:36:08.28 seven shot rocket pods, uh, 2.75 folding thin aerial rockets. We had, uh, a pair of, uh, 60s
00:36:08.28 --> 00:36:14.20 that were mounted with a flex gun, the copilot control those, but the, uh, the thing that really
00:36:14.20 --> 00:36:23.32 made us, uh, uh, unique and powerful was our door gunners. When I first got there and just, just for,
00:36:23.32 --> 00:36:29.16 a very short period of time, our door gunners were still firing 60s from the shoulder. And
00:36:29.16 --> 00:36:37.48 that, uh, that was just an incredibly powerful tool in keeping the bad guys heads down during our
00:36:37.48 --> 00:36:44.44 break and, uh, prepping the area for the next aircraft to, uh, to roll in. So we typically have, uh,
00:36:44.44 --> 00:36:52.44 door gunner on, uh, one side, on the other side if we were lucky, uh, uh, 50. Uh, eventually this
00:36:52.44 --> 00:36:59.24 group, uh, got, uh, some miniguns, most of all of our, uh, dead birds eventually, uh, had, uh, miniguns
00:36:59.24 --> 00:37:05.24 and the guys in the back would, uh, fly them and it, uh, did wonders for, uh, keeping, uh, keeping heads
00:37:05.24 --> 00:37:12.68 down as did the, uh, 50 cows that, uh, that we had. Uh, uh, when we went from shoulder here, uh,
00:37:12.68 --> 00:37:20.92 held 60s to, uh, there's a lesson there. Our guys would, uh, it wasn't unusual to see them standing out
00:37:20.92 --> 00:37:28.68 on the skids firing, uh, cover for us. That was a great good thing, but it also, uh, resulted in
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:37.56 brassing, uh, the uh, sink elevator and the, uh, uh, uh, it just wasn't really, really acceptable. If you
00:37:37.56 --> 00:37:43.40 brass a tail rotor, you'll know about it. It's a rough ride going back in, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they decided
00:37:43.40 --> 00:37:49.72 that, no, we can't have that. And, uh, sort of tied the gunner's hands by, uh, putting what they called a
00:37:49.72 --> 00:37:57.96 pussy pole in the, uh, in the, in the door and, uh, mounted the, uh, the 62. Well, the guys got, uh, more
00:37:57.96 --> 00:38:04.36 than a little incentive, and decided that, uh, if one 60s good, it would be better, and mounted two,
00:38:05.16 --> 00:38:13.40 one, uh, yeah, here we go again, Hayden, thanks. Yeah, but uh, mounted, uh, two sixties there,
00:38:13.40 --> 00:38:19.56 and found out that they were brassing the, uh, the tail rotor still. So what they did was,
00:38:19.56 --> 00:38:27.000 they rotated each 90 degrees in a, uh, opposing directions, and all of a sudden, uh, the brassing was
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.32 no longer, uh, much of a problem. To essentially the same with, uh, with our 50s, uh, they, uh, mounted
00:38:33.32 --> 00:38:40.84 that so that it, uh, would, uh, uh, fire, uh, 90 degrees, uh, longitudinally, and that was a, uh, a very
00:38:40.84 --> 00:38:49.72 powerful weapon for not only, uh, uh, keeping, uh, keeping guys down, but also, uh, gave us a, uh, a great
00:38:49.72 --> 00:38:56.28 degree of flexibility in the, in the, in the break. And perhaps I should explain, uh, that by the break,
00:38:56.28 --> 00:39:03.48 uh, we typically would fly in a, uh, in the wagon wheel type, uh, uh, type approach, uh, two helicopters,
00:39:03.48 --> 00:39:11.40 uh, roughly, uh, flying, uh, 180 out from, uh, one another. So one is, uh, rolling in on the target,
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:18.12 as the other is coming around behind it. So when you then break off the target, the next helicopter
00:39:18.12 --> 00:39:28.52 is in their, uh, laying down its fire. And, uh, that, uh, 50 would, would really help us out in both,
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:36.28 uh, identifying problem areas and taking care of the problem. Yeah, that's a great, uh, a great
00:39:36.28 --> 00:39:43.32 background and, and you know, even when you watch, um, uh, scrambled to see wolves, the just, uh,
00:39:43.32 --> 00:39:48.52 all the footage is just, un, it's unbelievable footage of the way you guys were flying and what the
00:39:48.52 --> 00:39:54.44 gunners were doing gunners hanging out and shooting underneath the bird back in the other direction,
00:39:54.44 --> 00:40:00.20 yeah, who, hanging out by a gunners belt, um, they might have invented the term gunners belt.
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:08.36 Yeah, I, I was, I go ahead. There, there, there's a, there's a right of passage that, uh, most of the,
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:16.12 uh, FNG's got. And when I was in that FNG seat, I learned it one dark and stormy night.
00:40:17.32 --> 00:40:21.96 We're flying along in the, and the, the hack, the aircraft commanded,
00:40:21.96 --> 00:40:26.04 diverted my attention off to the left. And when I turned back,
00:40:26.84 --> 00:40:33.80 right here in the window of the Huey was one of my gunners who had moaning me.
00:40:33.80 --> 00:40:38.04 Yeah. So hey, this is gonna be fun.
00:40:39.72 --> 00:40:45.08 That and the, the other was, uh, if, if you were new to the debt as a pilot,
00:40:45.72 --> 00:40:51.16 you were gonna get a colorful brass. Oh. And it was really easy for them to do when they had the
00:40:51.16 --> 00:40:54.60 free guns, uh, I think I got a little more in the front of the later on.
00:40:55.80 --> 00:41:00.12 Ah, that, that's, that's freaking dangerous. It is smart.
00:41:02.36 --> 00:41:08.76 So speaking of fun, one of the, one of the things, uh, I pulled off of the website, um,
00:41:08.76 --> 00:41:13.40 C Wolf dot org is you guys had this thing that you called the Wolf Graham, which was sort of,
00:41:14.84 --> 00:41:20.12 sort of like a sit rep for all the, all the different elements that were out there. And I think
00:41:20.12 --> 00:41:25.16 it paints a pretty good picture of the overall attitude. And I pulled out one of the clips,
00:41:25.16 --> 00:41:32.04 and I'm just gonna read it. So this is your debt debt for, from beautiful downtown Ben Luck.
00:41:32.36 --> 00:41:37.48 The fog cutters of debt for would like to wish everyone a merry monsoon season. Only 10 shopping
00:41:37.48 --> 00:41:43.72 days left. We'd better start with Lieutenant J. G. Who? Why before we forget him. Everyone else has.
00:41:43.72 --> 00:41:51.08 He, uh, he, uh, he, though he was leaving in May, but you, for God to assign a new duty station,
00:41:51.08 --> 00:41:55.88 admin forgot to request a flight booking for him. And operations forgot to inform him that this,
00:41:55.88 --> 00:42:02.36 that his F.T.L. papers had been signed, but we're sure we'll finally, but we're sure things
00:42:02.36 --> 00:42:09.88 will finally turn around for what's his name. Lieutenant Deacon Johnson left on R and R to Hawaii,
00:42:09.88 --> 00:42:16.36 and Lieutenant J. G. Rookie Rich. Uh, can't read the name, par, par, farmer, farmer. Yeah,
00:42:16.36 --> 00:42:25.64 farmer was called into straight now at Ben Toy. Ben Toei, cutting us two, three F.T.L.s and
00:42:25.64 --> 00:42:31.32 Anax. Commander Hammond will still have to fly every day, even after the Deacon gets back.
00:42:31.32 --> 00:42:37.000 Boku map as Lieutenant Johnson is referred to by Mama Son won't be much good for anything
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.72 after coming back from Hawaii. Rookie Rich is talent for hiding should be of great value in Ben Toei.
00:42:44.60 --> 00:42:53.08 Lieutenant J. G. Check Carlos Steel has opened a chain of combination taco stand slash minigun
00:42:53.08 --> 00:43:01.08 exchange outlets with branches in Kuchi, Tan Tan Ann and Ben Luck with others soon to be opening
00:43:01.08 --> 00:43:08.92 long bin ving long and via TN. Lieutenant J. G. Weird Harold Black is still looking for his
00:43:08.92 --> 00:43:15.96 mysteriously vanishing M60 bolts. latest debt for basketball casualty was Lieutenant J. G. Buckett's
00:43:16.52 --> 00:43:23.16 coffee named after his golden touch on the court who got four stitches in his head after going
00:43:23.16 --> 00:43:29.80 for a rebound, who will it be in April? Three additions arrived this past month, Lieutenant Tom
00:43:29.80 --> 00:43:37.56 Rebolla and Lieutenant J. G. Denny Rally, which is user, our new in-country and Lieutenant J. G. Bill
00:43:37.56 --> 00:43:44.36 Belts was shafted shifted from debt eight. Oh well with TV booze and all the attractions of the
00:43:44.36 --> 00:43:50.84 big city, what more could you want? As one of our departed pilots used to say, going home is for
00:43:50.84 --> 00:43:58.60 cices. So and you guys, these are all of I. They're fantastic to read. I read that to my buddy Dave
00:43:58.60 --> 00:44:03.80 Burke, where I sent I sent him a copy of it and he said that's the best set rep I've ever read in my life.
00:44:05.32 --> 00:44:11.64 So you guys had, you know, it's it's good because you know, I always talk and and and every
00:44:11.64 --> 00:44:18.28 vet that comes on here, we kind of talk about how we have fun and that shows that and I guess getting
00:44:18.28 --> 00:44:23.08 mooned through your side window also shows that you guys are having fun. I don't know if the
00:44:23.08 --> 00:44:30.36 hot brass is fun, but you guys were having a great time and you guys were making it fun and at the
00:44:30.36 --> 00:44:38.92 same time man, it was very intense and very dangerous. One of the things that, you know, you, you
00:44:38.92 --> 00:44:42.20 kind of threw it out there, you said, hey, we put these debts all over the place so we could have
00:44:42.20 --> 00:44:48.28 a quick response time. And what that meant was you guys were spread out in these debts so that you
00:44:48.28 --> 00:44:55.48 could get two guys on the ground within a matter of minutes. Tell me about that up tempo and what
00:44:55.48 --> 00:45:05.000 it was like when they scrambled the seawelfs. Well, we had two full crews for each one of our two birds
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:13.24 and what that meant was you were 12 hours on 12 hours off 365 24 whatever.
00:45:13.24 --> 00:45:23.16 In order to support the the Brownwater Navy, when they got in the ship, they needed us right away
00:45:23.72 --> 00:45:30.12 and we could literally get off the deck in about three minutes and that put us out there
00:45:31.24 --> 00:45:36.20 quickly enough that we could probably get them out of trouble. The worst thing that could
00:45:36.20 --> 00:45:44.84 happen to them in my estimation other than losing someone is losing their engine because then they
00:45:44.84 --> 00:45:52.68 were just out there with they were a grape. No place to go so all they could do is just absorb the
00:45:53.72 --> 00:46:02.28 the incoming and with that in mind what we would do is go on out and try and first get their heads down
00:46:02.28 --> 00:46:11.88 and then two start working the target. We had a very close relationship with the the PBR sailors,
00:46:11.88 --> 00:46:19.56 very close. Those guys were sticking their backs out every day and the times they got in trouble
00:46:19.56 --> 00:46:25.64 we were happy to go and try and extricate them no matter what.
00:46:25.64 --> 00:46:33.24 But one of the great quotes that I saw in the in the history that I was reviewing is the first
00:46:33.24 --> 00:46:42.60 contact that H.C. one made the two boats had gone out on patrol and it stumbled across a
00:46:42.60 --> 00:46:48.36 battalion size element with about 80 sand pans and junks that were trying to cross a river
00:46:48.36 --> 00:46:56.04 and the boats came under obviously intense fire. When they see the sea walls got there a couple of
00:46:56.04 --> 00:47:05.40 minutes after this the incoming fire team lead contacts the chief of the boat and says
00:47:06.28 --> 00:47:13.96 where do you want to put in our strike and he said something like hell. I want you boys to go in there
00:47:13.96 --> 00:47:24.20 and hold field day on those guys and that's where the attitude it is it's an overused term
00:47:24.20 --> 00:47:31.40 but it's a brotherhood it truly is we do anything for those guys they were putting it all out
00:47:31.96 --> 00:47:41.000 did you guys pre-brief with them for missions or how did you figure that out on how did you figure it out
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.16 so did you know where they were going did you know what their target was did they pre-breef you
00:47:46.04 --> 00:47:54.44 unfortunately we had intelligence that was to put a kindly generally a piece of crap it wasn't
00:47:54.44 --> 00:48:00.92 very good for a number of reasons for a number of reasons but what we do is we talked to the guys
00:48:00.92 --> 00:48:09.08 on the boats we know what the tactical situation was in the away and we would know where they were going
00:48:09.08 --> 00:48:16.92 and what they were doing that is going out for a bunker or you are doing an insert with seals
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:23.000 we'd get that information from the team that was there actually we didn't have a team it was
00:48:24.20 --> 00:48:31.64 just a squad but we'd share the information so we've know about where they were going
00:48:31.64 --> 00:48:40.44 and what we do as soon as we got airborne is head for the the pre-breef spot and then get update the info
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:46.36 in route so that by the time we got there we knew that where the fire was coming from what the situation
00:48:46.36 --> 00:48:52.36 was with the boats and where we were likely to put in our first strike so the deconfliction as far
00:48:52.36 --> 00:48:58.04 as where you were shooting in friendly fire and all that was I mean as long as as long as they tell you
00:48:58.04 --> 00:49:03.40 hey north north side of the river or something like that is that how you would deconflict and did you
00:49:03.40 --> 00:49:07.000 when you were supporting ground troops how the hell did you know who was who down there we'd
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.52 buy have them pop smoke and that generally worked but the worst thing that could happen is when you say
00:49:14.52 --> 00:49:21.80 pop red and one shows up right where you expected and one shows up a hundred meters on down
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:31.48 yeah so the bad guys had our head are freaks and I don't know if they had our freaks or not
00:49:31.48 --> 00:49:37.80 but they could certainly see a smoke and they'd pop it also right same one and that could
00:49:37.80 --> 00:49:44.52 create a little confusion but it also gave us a locus points that we could talk to the guys on the
00:49:44.52 --> 00:49:53.56 boats and they could direct our fire and one thing that's important about that the 2.75
00:49:53.56 --> 00:50:04.12 holding in the area rocket was a great tool I didn't like it much because it wasn't all that
00:50:04.12 --> 00:50:11.64 uncommon to have one of the the fins not open properly and then it just goes squirrely and go
00:50:11.64 --> 00:50:18.68 anywhere if you had the aircraft trimmed up it could be an effective weapon but I didn't like to
00:50:18.68 --> 00:50:27.24 use it too far out because that gave it more of an opportunity to develop a mind of its own
00:50:27.24 --> 00:50:34.76 I use it more as a as a close-end weapon so these the you'd be sitting in your in your
00:50:34.76 --> 00:50:41.56 hooch or whatever and you'd be standing by it was your 12-hour shift and then all of a sudden the
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:46.28 radio call would come in they tell you guys go what was the procedure like from there
00:50:47.96 --> 00:50:54.76 Aswell's an elbows out to the aircraft the one of the other crews first first guy there would be
00:50:54.76 --> 00:51:06.44 suddenly the aircraft was pre-coct but they'd go ahead and set the rockets up for us and
00:51:07.88 --> 00:51:17.000 jump in hit the button and go you every I think that it's safe to say that practically
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.72 every operational mission that we flew we took off over max gross weight you'd pull it up enough
00:51:25.72 --> 00:51:33.16 to get it out of the revotment and get it out there and what we do when we were really seriously
00:51:33.16 --> 00:51:40.68 overweight is just sort of inch it ahead and get a little forward momentum on the helicopter
00:51:40.68 --> 00:51:45.96 and then drop the collective which puts all the weight down on the skids and spread the skids
00:51:45.96 --> 00:51:53.40 and then pop it up a little and the aircraft would be slingshot up to oh about three feet and
00:51:53.40 --> 00:51:58.28 then you know hopefully you'll get across the B-40 fence at the end of the end of the runway
00:51:58.28 --> 00:52:06.76 it was colorful but had to do it in order to carry an affordance to get guys on the trouble
00:52:07.56 --> 00:52:13.56 then I mean when we were in Iraq we always felt like the helicopters which win
00:52:13.56 --> 00:52:18.84 Ramadi the helicopters they wouldn't really fly over the city of Ramadi because it was there was too
00:52:18.84 --> 00:52:26.12 dangerous for them the couple times that they came in it was like it was like a just massive
00:52:26.12 --> 00:52:32.92 machine gun fire at them and they didn't really enjoy that too much but you guys were just
00:52:33.48 --> 00:52:39.08 so my point is that helicopters and actually vehicles as well they're like bullet magnets right
00:52:39.08 --> 00:52:44.44 everywhere you see a helicopter come in the enemy just sees that and focuses on it you guys must
00:52:44.44 --> 00:52:50.68 have you had to be taking fire all the time yeah all the time you get used to it yeah
00:52:52.20 --> 00:53:00.60 what am I gonna say remind me of a the first time that we saw a 51 cal coming at us it was
00:53:01.24 --> 00:53:08.36 night and these things you know it's a big as a basketball it's as big as a freaking basketball coming
00:53:08.36 --> 00:53:15.40 up at you yeah it started to see the pressures come up at it and he says damn you did the right thing
00:53:15.96 --> 00:53:23.48 I said yeah and he said where the collective immediately got down on the deck and then
00:53:23.48 --> 00:53:30.28 came around and we could could adjust but those things are frightening oh yeah that's cut it goes with
00:53:30.28 --> 00:53:39.64 the turf you're 20 years old that was 23 at the time and it's you think the mission you think
00:53:39.64 --> 00:53:47.72 the the pride that you take in the guys and the the pride they take in you and it's frightening you know
00:53:47.72 --> 00:53:55.32 there's there I was terrified at times I think we all were that you you get by that you get by
00:53:55.32 --> 00:54:02.04 that you think about the guys down there who are really in the ship and it's easy to apply what
00:54:02.04 --> 00:54:07.64 you know tactically and get the job done that's that's another thing that that's why I was kind
00:54:07.64 --> 00:54:13.000 of asking you about meeting with the guys in the ground because you guys are doing this and I'm
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.16 sure in some situations you'd never met the people that were down there and you're still risking
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:24.92 your lives to go in there and give them the support that they need yeah that's what we did
00:54:26.20 --> 00:54:30.84 there's a there's a counter intuitive thing to to helicopters that you just mentioned which is
00:54:31.88 --> 00:54:36.36 when you're getting shot at from the ground if you get lower it takes away some of their
00:54:36.36 --> 00:54:40.60 field of fire right right so so you would think oh there's someone shooting it be I'm going to
00:54:40.60 --> 00:54:46.60 get up and go away when the reality is if you get lower you know that that person there's going to
00:54:46.60 --> 00:54:51.24 be trees or whatever terrain features in between that's kind of take a little bit of time too
00:54:51.24 --> 00:54:59.16 to get your instincts going in that direction yeah it certainly does but it's amazing how quick
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:05.88 those instincts are developed when you got somebody shooting that you and then the maintenance
00:55:05.88 --> 00:55:11.16 crews the birds are I saw pictures of birds they were just like look like they've been used for
00:55:11.16 --> 00:55:15.56 target practice yeah coming back you go watch that movie a scramble the sea well it looks like
00:55:15.56 --> 00:55:18.44 target practice was used that's what they were using the birds for target practice that's what
00:55:18.44 --> 00:55:23.32 some of them look like and the maintenance crews were just they they said they were making
00:55:24.36 --> 00:55:32.28 patches from beer cans that's true that's true and the guys were proud of that and the
00:55:32.28 --> 00:55:40.76 the patch that was a beer cam would not be painted over generally yeah no and there's one
00:55:40.76 --> 00:55:45.80 thing that I want to say and this is going to sound like a one trick pony in my love the gunners
00:55:46.68 --> 00:55:54.76 but those guys not only fired the weapons they service the weapons they service the the
00:55:55.88 --> 00:56:01.000 helicopters they performed all the daylies they were all qualified plane captains they kept
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.40 that thing up and running for us so that we could walk out with our silkscars and strap the
00:56:07.40 --> 00:56:13.40 thing on and take them out to where they needed to be in order to get the job done no we're not
00:56:13.40 --> 00:56:24.04 air force we don't believe in silkscars I'm sorry air force brother and then so you're doing this
00:56:24.04 --> 00:56:31.64 this is a crazy opt-temp operational tempo of 12 on 12 off 365 days yeah that's insane
00:56:31.64 --> 00:56:38.84 you get used to it you know it's funny I mean you got you got eight hours asleep okay
00:56:39.40 --> 00:56:43.32 then you got four hours to eat and then the other 12 hours you're on standby to go fly into
00:56:43.32 --> 00:56:49.96 into gun battles I got for 365 days yeah I got nervous though when I wasn't flying you know a
00:56:49.96 --> 00:56:56.12 decent aviator wants to fly and it's hard sometimes it's sitting around waiting for your turn
00:56:56.12 --> 00:57:04.68 we played and lifted a lot of weight a lot of volleyball the played volleyball with and against
00:57:04.68 --> 00:57:13.16 the the seals and sometimes the boat drivers it just it was uh 50 meters from the from the aircraft
00:57:13.16 --> 00:57:19.96 and I kept this uh kept this right there so we could respond quickly and then um how often were
00:57:19.96 --> 00:57:26.68 you guys doing casualty evacuation only when needed yeah yeah it it it wasn't a primary mission
00:57:26.68 --> 00:57:33.88 of ours if somebody got shot up and uh needed to lift out the town we'd provide that and occasionally
00:57:33.88 --> 00:57:41.80 we'd uh get a call that uh someone was uh wounded and uh we'd go out and pick him up but generally
00:57:41.80 --> 00:57:49.32 that was a job that was done by some certifiable idiots that I love the uh the dust soft pilots
00:57:49.32 --> 00:57:56.28 you got uh 2019 20 year old kids that are out there given the keys to uh a mazorati
00:57:56.28 --> 00:58:01.88 Chris this was only a Huey but still you get the idea they were crazy they'd fly into
00:58:01.88 --> 00:58:07.56 into anything I had really goes off to them because uh uh they'd fly into areas where they
00:58:07.56 --> 00:58:15.000 shouldn't that's another thing I talked about um with uh Colonel Bill Reader who is on this podcast
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.88 and same thing I mean he just said that the pilots back then and maybe it's because the aircraft
00:58:21.88 --> 00:58:27.16 were uh very inexpensive compared to the you know to what they flying nowadays they they don't
00:58:27.16 --> 00:58:32.76 want to risk the aircraft now but he said he's got they would just fly into like it was it
00:58:32.76 --> 00:58:36.52 hey your your your your aircraft is just gonna get hit that's the way it's gonna be
00:58:36.52 --> 00:58:44.84 yeah deal with it yeah and if you ever got to get the opportunity to read uh the uh some of the
00:58:44.84 --> 00:58:51.80 citation for the congressional metal for uh these are hellow pilots it's it's incredible what they did
00:58:52.84 --> 00:58:59.56 now what I was and I always on this show give the uh same praise that you give to the machine gunners
00:59:00.04 --> 00:59:04.52 because the machine gunners in in a ground combat it's the machine gunners that are going
00:59:04.52 --> 00:59:10.44 to allow you to be able to maneuver and get away from a situation um or maneuver towards you know
00:59:10.44 --> 00:59:15.88 they're gonna allow you to move and same thing with with your gunners and what they were doing
00:59:15.88 --> 00:59:22.44 so you had a gunner on each side that would protect the flanks that's right one of them on either
00:59:22.44 --> 00:59:31.16 a 60 or a dual 60 and the other one on a 50 cow generally or eventually a minigun oh and then
00:59:31.16 --> 00:59:38.52 you guys got the minigun yes I will in I looked at there was a real real fast flash on the screen
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:43.000 in scrambled to see wolves there's a minigun and it's actually it's upside down you can't I had
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:49.72 to pause it to read it it said um the Lord giveeth and the minigun take it away
00:59:51.72 --> 00:59:59.48 yeah it was a formidable weapon for uh close closer support yeah for people that don't know what a
00:59:59.48 --> 01:00:06.12 minigun is it fires it fires what 5,000 rounds a minute I mean it's absolutely ridiculous what it's
01:00:06.12 --> 01:00:12.76 yes I don't know what the rate is but it's it gets your attention yeah and it just it's powered
01:00:12.76 --> 01:00:17.80 it's it's powered it's electrically powered so it it actually feeds the ammunition faster than
01:00:17.80 --> 01:00:25.16 then then a normal mechanical weapon could fire but it just it's crazy how much and how many
01:00:25.16 --> 01:00:30.28 rounds I think it's 5,000 something like that it's a ridiculous hell and then you guys got those
01:00:30.28 --> 01:00:35.08 so those were on your birds while you were on deployment that's right yeah as far as the
01:00:35.08 --> 01:00:40.76 the minigun goes you know it doesn't go bang bang bang it goes a buzz at the rate of fire is
01:00:40.76 --> 01:00:45.56 phenomenal and they uh the gunners loved it but you know there's a little John Wayne in all of us
01:00:45.56 --> 01:00:52.36 and I think every one of them would like to go back to the yeah to the free guns one thing
01:00:52.36 --> 01:01:00.76 that I do want to point out is that uh we were not very well equipped so when we were up and around
01:01:00.76 --> 01:01:09.40 you know un-prol or or actually after engaged and had to fly into a gas up and a
01:01:10.36 --> 01:01:18.60 rearm we'd go into an army base because the army had all the fuel and they had nails
01:01:19.48 --> 01:01:27.80 the 2.75 makes a boom but if you can load it with flischets you can really keep the enemy down
01:01:27.80 --> 01:01:34.92 so we'd go on up there depending on the tactical situation if we had a cause it's a
01:01:36.12 --> 01:01:42.12 anti-personnel something developing on the ground we'd we'd load up there and that's where I
01:01:42.12 --> 01:01:50.36 saw my first cobra the snake was an impressive aircraft it was so much it had so much more fire
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:58.60 power than any one of our huies but where do you put the gunners you know it's for an half-seeding
01:01:58.60 --> 01:02:06.44 they don't have any suppression for a rolling off target other than your wingman and it
01:02:06.44 --> 01:02:11.72 just you know it was intriguing but it just didn't make sense to me do I remember this correctly
01:02:11.72 --> 01:02:17.32 that at one point you're whoever the commander was at the time got offered hey you guys want some
01:02:17.32 --> 01:02:21.56 cobras and the answer was no we we we need to stick with the US I'd heard that story I don't
01:02:21.56 --> 01:02:26.76 don't know whether it's true or not yet yeah yeah we like that but you know one of the guys you
01:02:26.76 --> 01:02:34.04 mentioned in the wolf gram and I will mention his name Chuck Steely up check was quite a guy
01:02:34.84 --> 01:02:45.16 and he would go out on to requisition parts for us at the time the army had a contractor
01:02:45.16 --> 01:02:51.88 dielectron that was doing the uh the work on their aircraft and you know they're bored out of
01:02:51.88 --> 01:02:58.76 their skull when they don't have anything to work on so they got a loach and started rebuilding it
01:02:58.76 --> 01:03:05.48 from spare parts from here and there and got it to be fully functional and you know it to have an
01:03:05.48 --> 01:03:11.40 observation helicopter like that to go out and snooping poop with us that would be incredible
01:03:11.40 --> 01:03:20.76 Chuck engineered a deal where a for a refrigerator full of beer they'd give us this aircraft you know
01:03:20.76 --> 01:03:25.88 it was written off the rolls they'd there because but you know they'd said hey if you have a
01:03:25.88 --> 01:03:33.08 problem let us know we'll come down take care of it I I like to think that Chuck was unplugging
01:03:33.08 --> 01:03:40.92 our refrigerator when the dead Owen C came in and not just know but hell no but yeah that's sort
01:03:40.92 --> 01:03:46.52 of thing was not unusual over there yeah God bus Chuck he did did everybody a lot of great
01:03:46.52 --> 01:03:54.44 service the uh the speaking of beer apparently the the wolf on the seawolf insignias somehow
01:03:54.44 --> 01:03:59.96 based on the low and brow beer can that's what they saw allegedly that's what they said
01:03:59.96 --> 01:04:05.80 I can either confirm or deny you know strangely enough I didn't drink much beer at all when
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:11.56 I was over there because uh they they seemed to treat it with something that just put the taste off
01:04:11.56 --> 01:04:18.04 we all thought it was formaldehyde that was the the going rumor but man they told us that
01:04:18.04 --> 01:04:22.12 going I was in go on my first deployment they told us the same thing yeah that there was from
01:04:22.12 --> 01:04:30.04 aldehyde that rumor has been that rumor survived from 1969 to uh 1992 and I was on my first deployment
01:04:30.04 --> 01:04:35.72 there was from aldehyde in the beer but how did the beer taste awful and I kept trying to see
01:04:35.72 --> 01:04:42.36 if I could make it taste better but I didn't succeed there's so some of the stuff that you're talking
01:04:42.36 --> 01:04:49.64 about you know from a leadership perspective you got you got guys that are risking their lives
01:04:49.64 --> 01:04:57.24 every time that call comes how how did you did you see guys that's that got to a point
01:04:57.24 --> 01:05:01.08 when they couldn't take it anymore did you did you have situations where you had to send guys back
01:05:01.08 --> 01:05:09.24 to the rear um what did you do when you saw guy kind of start to start to get to nervous to go
01:05:11.32 --> 01:05:18.04 uh this may sound self-serving but I don't care I didn't see anyone in the aldehyde
01:05:18.04 --> 01:05:25.64 and I did not see directly anyone who behaved in a cowardly manner an over cautious manner
01:05:26.36 --> 01:05:34.84 we didn't have anyone that uh was sent back to the to the rear there was a camaraderie that you
01:05:34.84 --> 01:05:41.000 just can't explain to somebody who hasn't enjoyed it it's uh it's an honor to serve with people like that
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:51.72 and we all took pride in our reputations among our our squadron mates so it wasn't hard to go
01:05:52.76 --> 01:05:58.60 and and that was so clear it when you watch scramble to see wolves it's so clear
01:05:59.96 --> 01:06:05.40 and there's this incredible um they you can see the camaraderie and you can hear it when you
01:06:05.40 --> 01:06:10.84 read through the the the wolf grams you can see that guys are having a good time and there's this
01:06:10.84 --> 01:06:17.48 I mean what what I would consider and you can tell me if I'm wrong but like a peer pressure of
01:06:17.48 --> 01:06:21.32 hey we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do this you know I've I've often
01:06:22.28 --> 01:06:29.96 said that when you get to a good seal platoon it's not a team it's not a platoon it's like a gang
01:06:29.96 --> 01:06:41.40 that you're a it's a gang and we just don't allow for that bad attitude to creep out yeah yeah I
01:06:41.40 --> 01:06:49.000 feel the same way about the uh the uh C wolves and this might be a bad good time to uh share with you
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.92 the fact that uh I at one time after a returning from Vietnam was so fed up with the mission that we were
01:06:58.92 --> 01:07:04.44 flying it was an aging aircraft it didn't have systems that were required to do the job the the uh
01:07:04.44 --> 01:07:12.52 job itself uh was not that important and you know you come from living on a dream adrenaline for
01:07:12.52 --> 01:07:19.32 a year and then come back and uh you're expected to add an old figuratively put your boots up
01:07:19.32 --> 01:07:27.72 on the table one day I got so pissed off the middle of the morning I uh jumped in my Corvette
01:07:27.72 --> 01:07:36.76 remember that uh hey I learned I learned jumped in my Corvette and uh uh Toran up to uh Coronado
01:07:36.76 --> 01:07:42.44 and two of the seals that we operated with friends uh were there and I walked into the office they
01:07:42.44 --> 01:07:49.48 had their LSDs pulled up face to face and I said guys I've had it I want to join up
01:07:50.52 --> 01:07:55.64 and they looked at each other and they locked up their secret and each of them grabbed me by an elbow
01:07:55.64 --> 01:08:01.16 and took me up to the little club in Coronado and we started pounding beers that tasted great
01:08:01.16 --> 01:08:07.64 no formaldehyde there and by the middle of the afternoon they'd convinced me that uh uh being a
01:08:08.28 --> 01:08:15.80 a peacetime seal uh wasn't uh everything that uh that I would expect and that they uh the
01:08:15.80 --> 01:08:20.76 navy had put an awful lot of investment into making me what I was and I could make them far better
01:08:20.76 --> 01:08:29.16 contribution by continuing to fly and I uh I turned my back on my opportunity to find out
01:08:29.16 --> 01:08:38.92 whether I had what it takes to become a seal I'm surprised that those guys um um well I'm surprised
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:43.64 they didn't talk you into it those must've been surprised they must've I was surprised once they
01:08:43.64 --> 01:08:48.44 got enough beer to them they didn't have you down it down at buds with a log of sand over your head
01:08:48.44 --> 01:08:56.04 is there any particular missions in when you were in Vietnam that that stand out as you know one
01:08:56.04 --> 01:09:02.04 of the ones on scramble sea wolves that they talked about this was absolutely ridiculous they're talking
01:09:02.04 --> 01:09:07.32 about the the the helicopter was the helicopters were there supporting a unit on the ground
01:09:07.96 --> 01:09:13.64 there was no one to relieve them um they needed more fuel they were running out of fuel the fuel
01:09:13.64 --> 01:09:18.84 it's on they're still no one to no one to relieve the helicopters and provide support they say you
01:09:18.84 --> 01:09:25.08 know what screw it we're just gonna stay until we run out of gas and that's and that's what they did
01:09:25.08 --> 01:09:31.64 they stayed until they ran out of gas the other group came in they used ammo cans to refuel
01:09:32.36 --> 01:09:38.12 to to carry once the fire on the ground had subsided they used ammo cans to refuel the
01:09:38.12 --> 01:09:44.36 helicopters that were out of fuel so they could get back to base that's freaking crazy
01:09:46.68 --> 01:09:52.84 you know we never really took time to think about whether it was crazy or not you got a job to do
01:09:53.56 --> 01:10:01.16 and you know that that's probably natural way to to explain it that was the job you went out
01:10:01.16 --> 01:10:07.64 and did that because that's what was expected that's what the guys on the in the boats expected
01:10:07.64 --> 01:10:12.60 of you that's what the uh the seal team that we had uh the seals that we had operate out and
01:10:12.60 --> 01:10:18.12 been like expected and when they call you you go you know that's another thing I think is really
01:10:20.68 --> 01:10:26.44 impressive about the seawolfs is well first of all they took volunteers to go to the job and like
01:10:26.44 --> 01:10:32.68 you said a bunch of people volunteered but the other thing is and and I heard some of the vets talking
01:10:32.68 --> 01:10:36.84 about the some of the seawolf vets talking about the fact that they'd say oh I was in the navy and I was
01:10:36.84 --> 01:10:42.84 you know in the ship and Vietnam people said are you or in the navy or in the ship but the reality is
01:10:42.84 --> 01:10:49.40 people you wouldn't I can't imagine that there was any of the gunners that when they joined the navy
01:10:49.40 --> 01:10:54.84 they thought to themselves what I'm gonna be is a door gunner and direct combat with the enemy
01:10:54.84 --> 01:11:00.68 these are guys that were joined the navy for whatever reason and they end up in that job
01:11:00.68 --> 01:11:07.16 where you know they're doing this day in day out and risking their life day in day out not
01:11:07.16 --> 01:11:12.92 not really what they signed up for and yet they held the line over and over and over again all of them
01:11:12.92 --> 01:11:22.36 volunteers yeah yeah it's it it it it it it it it humbles me to have been able to uh to operate with
01:11:22.36 --> 01:11:32.44 guys like that and you know I the pilot's yeah the pilot's brass balls it was expected it was the job
01:11:33.08 --> 01:11:39.40 the gunners had those balls and then some because they kept us up uh kept the aircraft up kept the
01:11:39.40 --> 01:11:48.76 systems up I had a leadership lesson when I first got there uh that grown up my dad you know he weed
01:11:48.76 --> 01:11:58.52 hunting fish and I uh it fired our we had two uh 14's for each bird they hung on the back
01:11:58.52 --> 01:12:03.16 of the pilot's seat and I taken one on out we had a little makeshift range and uh fired it
01:12:03.88 --> 01:12:11.08 and brought it back on in after I was done and took it in to the crew area to clean it
01:12:11.08 --> 01:12:20.44 you would have thought that I had just stepped on a baby rabbit I mean it was more it was
01:12:20.44 --> 01:12:28.68 plight it was respectful but give me that thing yeah and the guys had that feeling about uh the
01:12:28.68 --> 01:12:34.76 armament you know it this this is my job this I do this so you know it took a little getting used to
01:12:34.76 --> 01:12:45.16 it was easier to let him clean my 45 then uh I just kind of want to you know when you're when
01:12:45.16 --> 01:12:51.48 you're there um you you start to get to know these guys really well and I don't you didn't
01:12:51.48 --> 01:12:56.28 loot you didn't have anyone killed from your debt while you were there is that correct that's correct
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:04.68 but obviously other guys in other deaths were killed while you were there did you guys have any
01:13:04.68 --> 01:13:09.88 kind of and this is something I've talked about before is Americans and I think it's just um
01:13:09.88 --> 01:13:15.08 because we have so many different cultures here we don't have a good protocol to deal with to deal
01:13:15.08 --> 01:13:22.04 with death and you know other cultures around the world if someone dies you know you do this for a
01:13:22.04 --> 01:13:26.60 day you do this for a day you say this prayer you you go through this ceremony and then you move on
01:13:26.60 --> 01:13:30.76 and Americans we have so many different cultures here that are all mixed together and death isn't
01:13:30.76 --> 01:13:35.80 something that happens all the time so we really don't know a lot of times hey what am I supposed to
01:13:35.80 --> 01:13:40.28 do and I think that's what that's what causes people problems is they don't know they don't know
01:13:40.28 --> 01:13:45.56 how to handle it they don't not put closure on it and so it just kind of sticks around when you guys
01:13:45.56 --> 01:13:50.68 would learn that that someone in your debt had been killed what was there any protocol that you guys
01:13:50.68 --> 01:13:57.000 set up was there anything that you guys did to to try and take that on board and then move past it
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.56 I probably missed out on a leadership opportunity and when guys got killed uh and other deaths
01:14:05.56 --> 01:14:13.40 in combat or even just uh ferrying an aircraft in for maintenance I didn't sit down with the guys
01:14:13.40 --> 01:14:25.000 and talk about it I internalized it and being Irish would reflect on all the good times we had
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.28 didn't think about uh what what went wrong didn't want to know initially you know eventually you
01:14:32.28 --> 01:14:40.28 do because it's important for uh for your trade that uh I just think about the good times that we
01:14:40.28 --> 01:14:45.96 we shared together I lost a couple of the catamacross classmates I lost some great friends that I
01:14:45.96 --> 01:14:53.40 made while I was in country uh when you unfelling I don't want to mention any names but he and I were
01:14:53.40 --> 01:15:00.36 both bicyclists and the one thing that he wanted to do when he got back home was build himself
01:15:00.92 --> 01:15:07.80 the pre-mo bike and uh start to start competing and he never got that opportunity
01:15:09.32 --> 01:15:15.32 and when you when you personalize something like that when you think about the opportunities that
01:15:15.32 --> 01:15:25.56 are lost in a heartbeat it makes you very thankful to be alive it makes you very thankful of
01:15:25.56 --> 01:15:32.12 the two of known that person and it makes you feel like you should redouble your efforts to get
01:15:32.12 --> 01:15:39.72 the sons of bitches that took that life away from them. If that you can help focus your aggression
01:15:39.72 --> 01:15:46.68 and that's a good thing. Yeah no doubt about it and that was um I guess my way again I was uneducated
01:15:46.68 --> 01:15:53.08 no never taught me but one thing I did is okay we're gonna go to work that's the thing that I
01:15:53.08 --> 01:15:58.20 knew how to do that's what I still know how to do is like go to work and you know there's I guess
01:15:58.20 --> 01:16:04.04 you could say there's some uh you know eventually you got to you got to deal with it you got to
01:16:04.04 --> 01:16:11.64 uh feel it more in the future but man when I was overseas it's like yeah okay we're gonna work
01:16:11.64 --> 01:16:15.80 and and that's where the focus becomes because you know and also from my perspective it's like
01:16:15.80 --> 01:16:21.64 you know your guys that's what they would want you to do that's what they would want you to do
01:16:22.20 --> 01:16:28.68 so let me let me share something with you based upon what your guys would want you to do
01:16:28.68 --> 01:16:36.04 came home from a mission uh uh one night we were in contact and you know you're you're decompressing
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.40 and I walk up to my rack and there's this Manila envelope for Lieutenant J.G. Rally's eyes only
01:16:43.40 --> 01:16:50.44 and I feel oh no somebody back on the back home is died and I opened this thing up with trembling hands
01:16:51.16 --> 01:16:57.80 and pulled out and it's a standard navy message and I said hi honey I'm gonna be in
01:16:57.80 --> 01:17:06.68 Tanzanute in three days time come on up in uh and see me uh Sean's mom the love of my life
01:17:06.68 --> 01:17:12.84 call signs stinky there's gonna have anything to do with uh personal problems it's a matter of attitude
01:17:13.48 --> 01:17:18.76 yeah that uh she was a flight attendant for Branough and she was flying freedom birds in and out
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:24.52 and she had one coming in Ben Lex only about uh 40 clicks south of uh SIGON
01:17:24.52 --> 01:17:30.60 and okay and you know word immediately spread like wildfires throughout the debt
01:17:31.40 --> 01:17:40.04 and my guy is a god bless of these left in a sandbagged bunker or or enlisted crew
01:17:40.60 --> 01:17:46.68 and it was normally pretty ripe but it was also the only place that was really uh that had a
01:17:46.68 --> 01:17:52.92 little bit of privacy well they had determined that I was going to bring stinky on down uh for lunch
01:17:52.92 --> 01:17:59.000 I picked her up in Tanzanute and bring her on down so they had that place spit shot I don't know
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:07.08 they did it if it was already it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment uh we uh flew a
01:18:07.08 --> 01:18:12.76 flu helicopter on up to Tanzanute and you know we're going over uh bad guy country so uh it
01:18:12.76 --> 01:18:19.000 was armed and I land the thing in front of I know I didn't land it I wasn't flying it but we
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000 landed in front of the uh the terminal there at uh Tanzanute and uh immediately this air force truck
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.72 comes on out with its cherry top going and this uh this sergeant says you can't land here
01:18:31.72 --> 01:18:36.20 and I put it out to him that we already had and that we're just waiting for uh uh the arrival
01:18:36.20 --> 01:18:42.36 and uh we solve the problem by saying uh listen this aircraft is armed what did you stay here
01:18:42.36 --> 01:18:48.20 and watch it for us and uh we'll just be a little while so we walked on over this big old green
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:55.40 brand of jet comes on in and and everybody gets off and you know the incoming guys aren't nearly
01:18:55.40 --> 01:19:01.88 as gay and festive as he out going guys so uh they get off and uh there's a gale standing up at
01:19:01.88 --> 01:19:07.64 the top of the ladder just waving that me so turns out she came get off the aircraft but they didn't
01:19:07.64 --> 01:19:13.48 see anything about us getting on so uh you know my crew goes on up the uh the ladder and we're
01:19:13.48 --> 01:19:20.12 in there and gales and elucin into uh the other uh sturdises and they're loving it and uh we go to
01:19:20.12 --> 01:19:28.68 the back of the aircraft and sat there for 45 minutes just talking with each other but when we got back
01:19:28.68 --> 01:19:35.88 and gale wasn't there the the guys were just crest falling they were so excited about having
01:19:35.88 --> 01:19:45.16 somebody there and you know they I don't think the place was ever cleaned again but that was my
01:19:45.16 --> 01:19:55.16 experience of dating my hometown honey in the zone yeah then uh what was it like um was it standard
01:19:55.16 --> 01:19:59.80 Vietnam where just replacements would come when it was time for a guy to rotate out a new guy would
01:19:59.80 --> 01:20:06.44 show up pretty much like I mentioned earlier I was sort of kind of drift at the uh an apple
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:11.08 of so tell and happened to run into uh got weird Harold who you referenced in that wolf gram
01:20:12.20 --> 01:20:19.64 he uh came just walking through uh with uh the uh death 401c uh Colonel Hammond we
01:20:19.64 --> 01:20:27.24 called him currently was a navy commander and uh uh Dave introduced us and said hey this is a great
01:20:27.24 --> 01:20:33.16 guy we should have him and as a turns out they had an opening and uh within a matter of a few days
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:39.40 I was in debt four so it uh it was sort of a role your own environment yeah you know obviously
01:20:39.40 --> 01:20:44.84 they put guys into into slots where they needed them but uh the thing that it was fluid
01:20:47.08 --> 01:20:52.60 so then uh your time's coming up to to head home was it was at a one year 365 days
01:20:52.60 --> 01:20:59.56 yeah pretty much yes and then did you I'm you used stayed right on doing your 12 on 12 off until
01:20:59.56 --> 01:21:04.52 it was time to go what they normally do is for the last uh week or two that uh you were in
01:21:04.52 --> 01:21:09.72 country send you into a bend to you for the uh for the uh out processing and we'd fly with the
01:21:09.72 --> 01:21:16.36 sea lords so you know you didn't stop flying it was just a different mission and then you get back
01:21:16.36 --> 01:21:21.32 uh then you then you get okay your time's up and it's time to go home yeah pretty much well you know
01:21:21.32 --> 01:21:27.96 there there'd be a little bit of a party a drunk expert uh but other than that yeah yeah that's that was
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:35.40 that was it then how was that transition going from Vietnam and then what how many how many hours
01:21:35.40 --> 01:21:44.04 later you're back in America or how many days uh it was a straight through shot we stopped off uh in
01:21:45.80 --> 01:21:50.68 Honolulu there was one other stop maybe Guam and then Honolulu and then home it uh straight through
01:21:50.68 --> 01:21:55.72 and that's a way so you would you married you weren't married yet no now we got engaged on
01:21:55.72 --> 01:22:03.56 R&R and Hon Kong and that's a two-beer story so you got R&R from Vietnam met your
01:22:04.44 --> 01:22:13.56 your bride to be in Hon Kong that's right and proposed uh yeah you know we'd already talked about it
01:22:13.56 --> 01:22:18.52 we knew it was coming got down on any injury me skitching and all of a sudden but it was pretty
01:22:18.52 --> 01:22:26.92 interesting uh when I arrived in in Hong Kong uh we were I booked a room at the building so I
01:22:26.92 --> 01:22:32.76 go on down there and you know I'm checking in and I'm in my uh my uniform so the manager
01:22:32.76 --> 01:22:39.80 happens to be walking behind the desk and says oh Mr. Lali Mrs. Lali is waiting for you in your room
01:22:39.80 --> 01:22:46.04 if you can shit gales getting here to tomorrow what's mom gonna think of course gale got in a
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:56.76 day early she was in there but you know times were different back then so your transition from
01:22:58.12 --> 01:23:04.36 Vietnam back to America all of a sudden and you were you know people people use the term wild
01:23:04.36 --> 01:23:09.40 west sometimes describe various military situations where it was how it was like the wild west
01:23:09.40 --> 01:23:15.80 I don't know if it gets much more wild west they didn't even see well for Vietnam I mean it just
01:23:15.80 --> 01:23:20.44 doesn't seem the way you guys were running things the way the support that you got or didn't get
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.36 the I mean just the fact like you guys didn't even have flight suits they they wouldn't issue
01:23:26.36 --> 01:23:30.36 them or something like that and you guys were just wearing kind of what you what you could get a
01:23:30.36 --> 01:23:35.24 hold of everything was sort of wild west it took longer to get into a flight suit then it did
01:23:35.24 --> 01:23:44.36 to pull on a no-max shirt and certain bands and frequently it wasn't no-max and as they say you know
01:23:44.36 --> 01:23:51.64 I've flown missions in my 10 runners just we leave our our gear there in the seat and if I was playing
01:23:51.64 --> 01:23:57.56 volleyball and if the scrambles you you don't think about anything but getting in that aircraft and
01:23:57.56 --> 01:24:05.88 getting it cranking so yeah it was wild west and it got yeah and then and then you get back to America
01:24:05.88 --> 01:24:14.28 and you're still in the Navy right yeah how was that well got through train you know first of all
01:24:14.28 --> 01:24:20.52 you're just decompressing that was newly married the galloner getting used to living together
01:24:20.52 --> 01:24:30.92 she's dealing with my unique personality and it was sort of a scramble we partied art it's
01:24:30.92 --> 01:24:39.000 so when we got back a couple of seals one of them had a was connected to a family that owned
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000 one of the mansions they're in Coronado on the on the waterfront I think that was first street front
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.04 street at any rate just a man it was a beat up old place but it was truly a mansion and they had
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:56.84 a couple of mattresses on the floor and they had a table in the kitchen but no furniture and they had
01:24:56.84 --> 01:25:06.84 a a taper and we'd go over there and just party like crazy and we're going with this story
01:25:06.84 --> 01:25:12.68 is through all of that time and through all the craziness and through all of the drinking
01:25:12.68 --> 01:25:22.76 uh there was only one person who got hurt as a result of over indulging he ran his car into a
01:25:22.76 --> 01:25:27.40 telephone pole didn't didn't kill him didn't even hurt him very much but that was the only
01:25:27.40 --> 01:25:35.80 instance that I know of and the only casualty we had to alcohol was that same guy who turned
01:25:35.80 --> 01:25:47.08 himself in uh to for a and was uh cashiered out of the navy and then for ten years he was sober
01:25:47.08 --> 01:25:53.48 cleaning sober and he applied to get back in and the navy god love it let him back in
01:25:54.04 --> 01:26:00.76 but more remarkable than that this is one of our pilots now from the sea wolves they gave him
01:26:00.76 --> 01:26:07.000 his wings back and he finished up his career flying well that's awesome so yeah the the point is we we had a
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.76 really great time when we got back and all that was sort of uh a haze but when I checked into the
01:26:12.76 --> 01:26:20.84 squadron after I completed the rag uh learned to fly the the Norr Noble H3 C slug yeah
01:26:21.56 --> 01:26:27.96 our our community officer took me in and uh in my check-in board interview says I know where you've been
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:35.96 I know what you've done you aren't gonna get away with any of that crap here and that uh there was
01:26:35.96 --> 01:26:43.08 a leadership lesson there I knew that I never wanted to be like him yeah that had to be intimidating
01:26:43.08 --> 01:26:48.36 for a guy though that's taken on these these pilots that have been doing what you had been doing
01:26:48.36 --> 01:26:54.28 and all of a sudden they got to try and reign these guys back into the world yeah I hope I'm not going
01:26:54.28 --> 01:26:59.56 in the too many sea stories but that great friend about the only guy at names I'm using your guys who
01:26:59.56 --> 01:27:08.68 were just ceased but that huge canis was a copilot and we were set off to uh for uh to uh to
01:27:08.68 --> 01:27:17.80 Guam for some uh specialized training and he and I are there in our uh in our uh poopy suits
01:27:17.80 --> 01:27:26.84 at the bar the O'Claub bar at the Air Force base on Guam and we're in enjoying a couple of
01:27:26.84 --> 01:27:33.40 beers which tasted good and all of a sudden this bell rings like crazy and income these guys in
01:27:34.12 --> 01:27:40.76 pressed flight suits with ass gotts and everybody in the bar all the Air Force guys are standing
01:27:40.76 --> 01:27:47.96 at attention this B52 crew coming back from a mission and we're just sitting there with Air
01:27:47.96 --> 01:27:54.76 elbows on the bar and the crowd didn't know what to make of us but uh they didn't get too close to
01:27:54.76 --> 01:28:02.60 a sea there it's a c'mon guys we all have a mission to do and rolling thunder was a very important
01:28:02.60 --> 01:28:10.60 if uh taken to its uh conclusion uh we might have not a flossed that war and I I use the
01:28:10.60 --> 01:28:17.40 words loss and war carefully there and that's not it that is slip of the tongue um they've
01:28:17.40 --> 01:28:24.60 got a mission to do but I mean yeah the war from 40,000 feet and they were they're worried about
01:28:24.60 --> 01:28:29.64 the sands because they turned in it that's I don't want to go there I'm sorry I'd like to apologize
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:33.56 to the United States Air Force and all the noble men and women who fly for the Air Force
01:28:33.56 --> 01:28:42.76 yeah that's uh actually you know those um when when we got back from Ramadi we we um we got
01:28:42.76 --> 01:28:48.28 after it in a very similar way um for several months I don't know how long you did but
01:28:48.28 --> 01:28:54.20 yeah there was a lot of uh beer and other things that were drank and and I don't know
01:28:54.76 --> 01:28:59.64 you know there's it was sort of uh it was sort of it seemed like the the normal thing to do
01:28:59.64 --> 01:29:04.60 I don't know it seemed like we were gonna kind of get it out of our systems for a little while
01:29:04.60 --> 01:29:11.40 and you know um get over it because it is it is you know it's not that big of a deal I don't
01:29:11.40 --> 01:29:14.36 want to make it sound like it's all crazy but you know you're over there and it's like okay
01:29:14.36 --> 01:29:19.48 it's a little bit of it's it's a different it's a different scenario and you got to kind of
01:29:19.48 --> 01:29:24.92 process through the fact that everything that you just were doing whatever a week ago two weeks
01:29:24.92 --> 01:29:30.44 ago three weeks ago is now completely different but your life is completely different and there's
01:29:30.44 --> 01:29:35.08 no one's shooting at you and there's no one not you're not gonna lose in your guys which was the
01:29:35.08 --> 01:29:41.80 the the weight that I felt lifted off of me about a month after I got home I was I just you know
01:29:41.80 --> 01:29:46.12 woke up one morning and I just kind of felt different and I kind of I was like why do I feel
01:29:46.12 --> 01:29:53.64 I felt different in a good way and what I felt was oh I was thinking about why do I feel different
01:29:53.64 --> 01:29:57.64 right now and and as I sat there and thought about it I was like I'm not worried about any of my
01:29:57.64 --> 01:30:01.88 guys getting killed right now which was the first time in months that I hadn't been thinking about
01:30:01.88 --> 01:30:06.92 that all day every day and so yeah when you come home um there's there's definitely that and I
01:30:07.72 --> 01:30:14.36 I think it's I think you got to pay attention as a leader to everyone in that group to make sure
01:30:14.36 --> 01:30:22.68 that guys are staying within the box and staying within what's what's and I guess possibly normal
01:30:22.68 --> 01:30:28.04 for those situations because you can definitely be you can there will definitely be individuals that
01:30:28.04 --> 01:30:32.44 they'll they'll go too far and that they're they're not making the transition and what they need is
01:30:32.44 --> 01:30:37.40 you know some help someone to come alongside, pull alongside and say hey man let's let's take it back
01:30:37.40 --> 01:30:42.92 a little bit or you know let's let's readjust and you know life's gonna be normal again and all that
01:30:44.76 --> 01:30:51.64 unfortunately the the way we were ruled in and out of the squadron when we left and came back to the
01:30:51.64 --> 01:30:58.52 world it was pretty much an individual effort so that and I also tempered with fact that your
01:30:58.52 --> 01:31:06.92 war was entirely different than ours I would imagine years was more up close and personal than
01:31:06.92 --> 01:31:15.64 than ours the tell you the truth I don't recall ever reflecting on whether my guys were going to
01:31:15.64 --> 01:31:20.84 come back from this mission or not you know it's something that we just all did we all did it together
01:31:20.84 --> 01:31:28.20 and I don't mean that to sound callous it just isn't wasn't part of my thinking and that goes back
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:34.36 to what cousin Kim asked you know how did you do it yeah trying to bring everybody back home
01:31:35.48 --> 01:31:40.44 yeah I don't I definitely the without question thought about that every every day
01:31:40.44 --> 01:31:46.44 that was the biggest thing that I thought about every day was because there was guys getting
01:31:46.44 --> 01:31:54.68 killed every day basically there was memorial services every day there was you know one of the
01:31:54.68 --> 01:32:00.36 one of the things I've talked about this a bunch but there was a vehicle graveyard outside it wasn't
01:32:00.36 --> 01:32:05.08 it was on the way to the gate to leave Camp Ramadi there was a vehicle graveyard where all the vehicles
01:32:05.08 --> 01:32:11.80 that had been blown up and destroyed by IDs and there was I would say 50 or 75 maybe even 100
01:32:11.80 --> 01:32:18.84 but a massive area and so in order to leave the gate you drove by that you know it was a it was a
01:32:18.84 --> 01:32:22.20 it was a pretty harsh reminder and you know my guys were gone missions I wasn't always going on
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:27.24 missions because I was overall in charge and there was multiple units and so a lot of times I'd be
01:32:27.24 --> 01:32:32.44 just saluting the guys as they'd be leaving and and that's a worse feeling of like okay you know
01:32:33.40 --> 01:32:36.92 you just you just got your damn fingers crossed and you hope you've done everything you can
01:32:36.92 --> 01:32:43.88 and hope you've mitigated the risk but that was the heaviest the heaviest weight for me was just
01:32:43.88 --> 01:32:49.24 that daily thought every because then there was also there was to fact that there was always
01:32:49.24 --> 01:32:54.44 guys in the field almost always there was almost always one of my you know little detachment to
01:32:54.44 --> 01:32:59.80 guys was out there with seven guys and 20 Iraqi soldiers and there was gunfights going on and
01:32:59.80 --> 01:33:07.16 that's the way it was that was the that was the heaviest thing from a leadership perspective for me
01:33:07.80 --> 01:33:15.24 and yeah so when I got home it took about a month you know before I was like before and the
01:33:15.24 --> 01:33:19.56 the other thing is I didn't well everything that I'm saying about that feeling I was barely
01:33:19.56 --> 01:33:24.60 conscious of it while I was there I was like it was there but I was more focused on doing the job
01:33:24.60 --> 01:33:27.96 it was more focused on it kind of cooked me like you know when they say the frog
01:33:27.96 --> 01:33:32.20 gonna be put the frog in the boiling water you cook it slow whatever you there was like that it
01:33:32.20 --> 01:33:36.76 was more like that like over time it just built up and what I did was just focused on working working
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:42.28 hard but then when I got home it was like I said it was like a month after I got home I woke up one
01:33:42.28 --> 01:33:50.60 day and just felt like a weight lifted and I was saying what do I what is that what is that and
01:33:50.60 --> 01:33:54.28 then as I thought about it I'm thinking one of my not why do I feel like this you know I just
01:33:54.28 --> 01:33:59.56 had a big smile my face and was you know walking around my house and and thinking myself
01:33:59.56 --> 01:34:05.000 ah this feels good what is this and then I realized oh you're you're you're actually not worried
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.44 that one of your friends is gonna die today which was a which was a totally it's like I said
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:15.64 it was something that crept up on me and was just there there's just part of being over there
01:34:15.64 --> 01:34:26.52 and felt good to to have that weight come off but you know again I think I dealt with it pretty
01:34:26.52 --> 01:34:31.40 decently and you know did I get drunk with my friends yeah well there was some some significant
01:34:31.40 --> 01:34:39.08 to you bruiser activities that were were were fun and we let off a lot of steam and I think
01:34:39.08 --> 01:34:43.88 that's fine but again you know what worries me about saying that is that there's some people
01:34:43.88 --> 01:34:49.88 that take that as like oh okay now I'm cleared hot just to go and get drunk and get crazy and
01:34:49.88 --> 01:34:54.68 it's like no actually you're not you gotta keep that in check and especially from the guys
01:34:54.68 --> 01:34:59.48 that are in leadership positions hey man you gotta keep a close eye and step back and detach
01:34:59.48 --> 01:35:04.36 and look at the guys and say okay I get it we're gonna let off some steam I get it we're gonna
01:35:04.36 --> 01:35:09.56 adjust back the real world but we need to make sure that everyone is staying inside the box
01:35:09.56 --> 01:35:14.84 and make sure that they're gonna come back out of this thing okay because I mean we all know it
01:35:14.84 --> 01:35:20.84 nowadays man the vet's veterans come home and that's a hard transition to make from from combat
01:35:20.84 --> 01:35:26.12 to you know the civilian world and and even the world that you're talking about going from
01:35:26.12 --> 01:35:29.96 being a sea wolf in the wild west come back to your commanding officer saying look you're not
01:35:29.96 --> 01:35:34.76 gonna get away with that crap here and you know we we definitely had our share of little
01:35:34.76 --> 01:35:41.08 stories like that from to you bruiser where you know guys guys would not quite be ready you know
01:35:41.08 --> 01:35:47.64 as a matter of fact JP to know who is with me at echelon front my brother when he came home
01:35:47.64 --> 01:35:52.76 when we came home he was in another tune got hurt they sent him to our basic training school
01:35:52.76 --> 01:35:59.80 so but he's gonna be a bud instructor and he didn't last very long over there because you can't
01:35:59.80 --> 01:36:05.24 take a guy that's 23 years old that just been through what JP had been through and say okay now you're
01:36:05.24 --> 01:36:11.16 gonna go go and be in charge of training these guys that are trying to make it through but it wasn't a
01:36:11.16 --> 01:36:16.68 good fit and so I just you know luckily had friends and we were able to just pull them over and you
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:21.16 worked directly from me again getting guys ready for the the more advanced training in combat training
01:36:21.16 --> 01:36:28.12 which he was perfect for but that was an example of where you know I was I had to look out and say okay
01:36:28.12 --> 01:36:35.88 this is not a good job for him right now you know JP's already an intense an intense guy and
01:36:35.88 --> 01:36:41.16 coming home from Ramadhi you know it was it was a tough deployment you know he lost friends
01:36:42.04 --> 01:36:50.20 and as a young kid he wasn't ready to be teaching these young you know he's looking at these
01:36:50.20 --> 01:36:55.96 kids like you know you're you kidding me I'm gonna I'm gonna freaking decimate you guys and so I had
01:36:55.96 --> 01:37:03.24 to pull them over to a little bit more advanced training my brother JP so you get oh so now so now
01:37:03.24 --> 01:37:09.96 you you're staying in the Navy that's it never doubting my mind and you end up I mean you you end
01:37:09.96 --> 01:37:14.84 up doing the anti submarine warfare which is the job that kind of a no is that the job that annoyed you
01:37:15.40 --> 01:37:22.84 we called it also what you were given a mission without the the meanest to prosecute the mission and
01:37:22.84 --> 01:37:29.40 that annoyed me and then and then you went on to become a test pilot is that right correct
01:37:29.40 --> 01:37:35.24 the steely eyed granite jaw test pilot and look at me now so so what is that job like
01:37:37.64 --> 01:37:43.000 it's it's fascinating you know I'm living proof that nothing arms are a person more than
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.36 too much formal education but I get off on that and it was brought home to me once when we were
01:37:48.36 --> 01:37:53.48 having a raging party at our home in protection river Maryland when I was there at the test center and
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:59.24 most of the guys had have a copy of playboy magazine on their night table a couple of guys have gone
01:37:59.24 --> 01:38:04.68 back to take a leak in our bedroom and found that I had some technical reports there and I
01:38:05.48 --> 01:38:11.72 online and I didn't hear the end of that for a long time but I enjoyed it I enjoyed the the technical
01:38:11.72 --> 01:38:20.20 aspects of it I I often said there are only two topics that are worthy of conversation between men
01:38:20.92 --> 01:38:27.96 and that is flying in the fornication and you know I I I lived to fly
01:38:28.84 --> 01:38:33.72 having said that since I retired I have flown very little but at that point in my life
01:38:33.72 --> 01:38:41.16 it was all about flying and it was a wonderful experience the the flying we did was not
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:46.76 experimental flying it was engineering flying we test out weapon systems we test out new aircraft
01:38:46.76 --> 01:38:54.44 I was fortunate to to lead one of the three prongs of the the biggest telecopter acquisition
01:38:54.44 --> 01:39:00.84 that the Navy's made when they were looking for the new lamps helicopter two of my great good friends
01:39:00.84 --> 01:39:07.64 were we're flying the uh... secoreski and the uh and the uh Boeing products and they were pretty
01:39:07.64 --> 01:39:13.96 well through their test uh program which took I think about a year when uh bell helicopter
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:19.64 piped up and says hey we've got one too well they didn't have a a really logical
01:39:19.64 --> 01:39:25.08 contenter but they needed somebody to go on down and leave the test of that aircraft and
01:39:25.08 --> 01:39:30.60 that was me and boy that was fun you know you hear literally or flying the test card
01:39:30.60 --> 01:39:35.88 that takes out to the edge of the envelope and hey are you good enough sure i'm good enough
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:41.16 yeah just uh don't go too far and don't bust your ass there's there's a lot of uh investment
01:39:41.16 --> 01:39:45.40 that you're sitting in right there that you want they want you to keep in uh in one piece but
01:39:45.40 --> 01:39:52.76 no I thoroughly enjoyed it uh lifelong friends there and just keep me to a story the two guys
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:58.52 that were flying uh the uh Boeing's in secoreski dear friends one of them was an naval academy
01:39:58.52 --> 01:40:04.12 classmate and he and i flew in Vietnam and uh the other guy Greek is just a wonderful guy and
01:40:04.12 --> 01:40:12.76 still a lifelong close friend well duck uh was unfortunately fortunately for uh
01:40:12.76 --> 01:40:18.36 Hughes became their chief test pilot uh he got out of the navy and was uh flying for Hughes
01:40:18.36 --> 01:40:26.84 and was killed in uh in a horrible uh accident and Greek and uh uh sort of sort of close ranks
01:40:26.84 --> 01:40:35.08 and uh decided that uh we were going to uh try and send uh duck off in good stead so uh
01:40:37.16 --> 01:40:43.88 if you're familiar with San Diego now you know about the point luma lighthouse and the area up there
01:40:43.88 --> 01:40:51.24 that's where the family was waiting Hughes had given us a uh 500 to uh scatter the remains in uh
01:40:51.24 --> 01:40:58.84 that Greek took it upon himself to do this now at this time he probably had uh 2500 flytars
01:40:58.84 --> 01:41:04.76 he knew his way around the helicopter he's in his navy blues he gets in the aircraft he's got
01:41:04.76 --> 01:41:12.92 the cremeins in his lap and they're flying out along well below uh the uh the point on on out
01:41:12.92 --> 01:41:20.20 over the ocean and he looks up and sees the family up there and he's so emotionally wrought
01:41:20.20 --> 01:41:26.28 that he reaches down and takes the lid off of the cremeins well if you've ever been an helicopter
01:41:26.28 --> 01:41:34.20 you know that it's not they uh a very stable place to have cremeins and immediately he said it was
01:41:34.20 --> 01:41:41.72 IFR inside that cockpit with duck every one of her and fortunately the family didn't know what
01:41:41.72 --> 01:41:49.72 was going on and everything uh came out fine but Greek could call me up and said hey uh uh had uh had
01:41:49.72 --> 01:41:54.12 to make mustard today and I said yeah and he says yeah and when I got my blues out I'm still
01:41:54.12 --> 01:42:03.72 brushing duck off of the... so yeah there's ways you uh you accommodate that uh uh i always think
01:42:03.72 --> 01:42:10.68 of the great good times that uh that duck and uh Greek and I had together and I mis-im-sure
01:42:10.68 --> 01:42:17.32 I mis-im all the time but you life goes on sounds like he had to final say about what
01:42:17.32 --> 01:42:24.76 yeah yeah you were OIC during the Iranian hostage crisis what was that like?
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:35.56 uh that uh was self-made you know yes we were the only uh uh helicopter out there
01:42:36.52 --> 01:42:43.24 that wasn't on the large gray boats to actually fly the mission that could provide combat
01:42:43.24 --> 01:42:49.16 search and rescue uh so uh we took full advantage of that uh got the uh armament that we thought
01:42:49.16 --> 01:42:54.68 we passing through Guam uh I didn't like the side arm I had so I went on down to buy one
01:42:54.68 --> 01:42:58.92 and oh it's gonna take two weeks and it took me about two hours to get in touch with the uh
01:42:58.92 --> 01:43:05.96 local authorities and I had my uh my side arm I'm not going over the horizon which is sort of silly
01:43:05.96 --> 01:43:12.52 you know I mean really uh you're you're flying an over water mission and you need to
01:43:12.52 --> 01:43:18.12 sell any and ever can tell it's always good to be prepared but at any rate uh we'd go out there
01:43:18.12 --> 01:43:24.60 and uh and just train for that uh when we weren't actually out there in in support of the uh the
01:43:24.60 --> 01:43:31.56 the boats uh we've gotten a train for that you end up doing your 20 years um and then you
01:43:31.56 --> 01:43:37.96 called it at 20 is that this how long you did 20 21 21 years and then you went off to the civilian
01:43:37.96 --> 01:43:44.20 sector because it had started working a bunch of various jobs that's right I started out in high tech
01:43:46.04 --> 01:43:54.04 our company had uh a professional staff of 260% of whom were PhDs and I had enough technical background
01:43:54.04 --> 01:43:59.80 that uh I'd go out to a customer with one or more of these PhDs and they'd make their presentation
01:43:59.80 --> 01:44:06.20 and I'd say let me thank you what the doctor meant to say was yeah and I just had it and a great
01:44:06.20 --> 01:44:13.48 a being surrounded by smart people and just is a lot of fun it can be very frustrating at times
01:44:13.48 --> 01:44:22.20 but it's a lot of fun yeah and we have a curious insult in the teams which is someone will
01:44:22.20 --> 01:44:28.68 ask you about a guy and the guy's not a bad guy but someone will say oh you know he's he's a really
01:44:28.68 --> 01:44:36.28 smart guy when you might not be the best most common sense you might not be the best leader but you
01:44:36.28 --> 01:44:42.76 don't use this smart guy so yes you can get frustrated you can around with people that are super
01:44:42.76 --> 01:44:49.32 smart and then fine and then when did you move to Hawaii about 14 years ago I spent five years
01:44:49.32 --> 01:44:55.80 in uh range operations and then they created a new position and for my last five working years
01:44:55.80 --> 01:45:01.48 I was the environmental manager for the Pacific Missile range my daughter when she learned of that
01:45:02.04 --> 01:45:09.24 said dad you hate those guys and I said yes Heather but no I'm in a position to say no
01:45:10.12 --> 01:45:15.72 I just had a lot of fun you know the local environment I'm in community great people
01:45:16.28 --> 01:45:24.60 but they were not strong supporters of military training and that that was uh the my cause
01:45:24.60 --> 01:45:30.44 to help them explain why we needed to train out there and that we were right out to kill the
01:45:30.44 --> 01:45:39.24 whales yeah we were yeah and then how long ago was it that you retired retired about four years ago
01:45:40.12 --> 01:45:52.68 that's retirement has been very very good DJ and I mean I got I got one more quote that I that I
01:45:52.68 --> 01:45:59.000 wanted to read because I know we've been going out for a bit here but uh this is this is another quote
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:06.68 this is a quote from from a Vietnam seal um and here we go not only does many a seal
01:46:06.68 --> 01:46:12.20 always life to the sea wolves but the units often operated together as a team very often located
01:46:12.20 --> 01:46:17.96 at the same base of operations we developed friendships that are still alive today operating well
01:46:17.96 --> 01:46:24.44 outside standing oper standard operating procedures the sea wolves have lifted seals out of enemy
01:46:24.44 --> 01:46:30.28 encirclements and I have known them to land in a hot LZ to lift out cash is too large for the
01:46:30.28 --> 01:46:37.000 seals to pack out they also evacuated our wounded when metovac helicopters were not available
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.56 most important they were always there for us when we were down in the mud and darkness the night
01:46:43.56 --> 01:46:51.40 illuminated with red and green tracers the VC behind every shadow many times after we were out of danger
01:46:51.40 --> 01:46:57.000 they stayed with us until we were safely extracted in the middle of the river and out of the
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:06.44 range of enemy fire and that's chief Barry Enoch who's a legendary seal from seal team one navy
01:47:06.44 --> 01:47:15.40 cross for Cyprian and I think that that quote just really exemplifies the the bond between seals
01:47:15.40 --> 01:47:21.24 and sea wolves and like I said it was something that I heard about as a young seal and it's a bond
01:47:21.24 --> 01:47:28.04 that still exists when when I talk to the Vietnam seals and it's a bond that's uh that's always
01:47:28.04 --> 01:47:37.56 going to be there and um all into that do you have any uh you know like I said we've been at it for a while
01:47:37.56 --> 01:47:42.12 and I like I like I told you before we started I could sit else in here I could sit here to listen to you
01:47:42.12 --> 01:47:47.96 all day but uh do you have any other you know any other closing thoughts that you want to that you want to
01:47:47.96 --> 01:47:59.24 mention uh hand salute to the 44 that didn't make it back with us uh anyone who hasn't been
01:47:59.88 --> 01:48:05.56 to the wall anybody who served who hasn't been to the wall you ought to make that trip
01:48:08.36 --> 01:48:15.80 a shout out again and I know it sounds like a broken record but to the guys that are responsible
01:48:15.80 --> 01:48:24.20 for getting me back in one piece our gunners great human beings and uh to the guys I flew with
01:48:24.20 --> 01:48:32.12 hey next time we'd get together the beers on you yeah I I should share with you that uh as a
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:39.40 technical person I have developed what I call rallies theorem and rallies theorem says that all the
01:48:39.40 --> 01:48:47.24 truly great ladies hook up with all the truly big buffoons and stinky if you're out there listening
01:48:47.24 --> 01:48:55.80 I sure am glad that you did that love you more than pork chops maybe and uh well also thanks

01:50:47.08 --> 01:50:54.20 yes you should know that so go to originmain.com that's where you get your key and rash cards for
01:50:54.20 --> 01:51:01.16 jj2 hundred percent bar none I'm almost tempted to say don't even get any other kind of key or rash
01:51:01.16 --> 01:51:08.52 card I would agree with that yeah boom hundred percent also if you're warming up or cooling down
01:51:08.52 --> 01:51:15.56 or just cruising they have joggers you got into the joggers yeah that's the my son got some of the
01:51:15.56 --> 01:51:22.28 joggers which he's totally stoked on I tried them on yeah just to see it was so horrible they
01:51:22.28 --> 01:51:28.52 are so not not not in situation well here's the thing with joggers depending on how you wear them
01:51:28.52 --> 01:51:34.04 for sure but they're more of a should I put this kind of
01:51:35.08 --> 01:51:41.24 acceptably they're kind of form feeding from time to time right so they're you know they're kind of
01:51:41.24 --> 01:51:48.28 you know so they don't flap around so they're form feeding you in form feeding joggers yeah
01:51:48.28 --> 01:51:54.20 that could see how that could be a violation for sure but if you're not joko joggers most comfortable
01:51:54.20 --> 01:52:01.64 joggers in the world probably in the history of joggers maybe ever origin main origin joggers also
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:09.000 we got some supplements on there that you can take you got joint warfare which will keep your joints
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:22.04 intact yeah krill oil same thing kind of universal substance yeah that's the main team
01:52:22.04 --> 01:52:29.24 that I went off the joint warfare for a little while why oh long story being yeah I didn't
01:52:29.24 --> 01:52:34.12 lapse of discipline you know all the kind where I'm like oh I don't feel the pain you know
01:52:34.12 --> 01:52:40.68 enough so I just don't I'm not like compelled as much you know when you you make it like a routine
01:52:40.68 --> 01:52:45.56 no right like that's just the thing I get up every day yeah I take it before I get I take
01:52:45.56 --> 01:52:50.04 krill oil and and joint warfare when I wake up in the morning and before I go to bed at night
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:54.44 period and destroy every day yeah like you didn't even train that day still the 100%
01:52:54.44 --> 01:53:01.72 joint warfare didn't train that day but yeah well still discipline is not 100% because I don't take that
01:53:01.72 --> 01:53:07.80 every day I take it when needed yeah but I will say I've been using I feel like that's a
01:53:07.80 --> 01:53:12.28 little bit of a crutch right out because I've been using it a lot before just yeah well still you
01:53:12.28 --> 01:53:17.96 can take it every yeah you can but no the joint warfare I like your mindset I think I actually
01:53:17.96 --> 01:53:22.76 think I should incorporate that works just that's just how every day so with the joint warfare I'll
01:53:22.76 --> 01:53:28.60 be like well you know like it'll be in my mind not even necessarily heavily but it will be in my
01:53:28.60 --> 01:53:35.64 oh did I train hard enough to warrant like joint warfare kind of kind of attitude it's more or less
01:53:35.64 --> 01:53:42.92 like that so I wasn't feeling any kind of inflammation or pain or nothing so I was like you know
01:53:42.92 --> 01:53:48.44 I saw it so I skipped it one day and then I sort of you know it just wasn't in my mind sure enough
01:53:48.44 --> 01:53:54.04 and I'm still lifting still doing it still in the game freaking elbow comes back
01:53:54.04 --> 01:54:00.52 because I'd get elbow from you know and I'd get little elbow things nothing terrible you
01:54:00.52 --> 01:54:06.52 just got to warm up more whatever but man it came back just like oh the joint war 100% this
01:54:06.52 --> 01:54:11.08 is just the other day so usually it takes a few days to like kind of get back how's it feel like
01:54:11.08 --> 01:54:16.60 now it's fine but when I started like if I started to do a push up like a close grip push up right
01:54:16.60 --> 01:54:20.84 now I'll feel it probably yeah maybe I don't know because it's been a few days so that's
01:54:20.84 --> 01:54:27.16 joint warfare a good oil discipline and then got milk which is just the food that you need in your body
01:54:27.16 --> 01:54:33.08 yeah that's what it basically is yeah and it tastes good and also for your kids you got
01:54:33.08 --> 01:54:38.44 where your kid milk strawberry and chocolate they're both really good but let's face it
01:54:38.44 --> 01:54:45.16 strawberry is a whole another deal Brian is working on adult strawberry milk will be coming out with
01:54:45.16 --> 01:54:53.80 that can I shoot this about the regular milk dark chocolate is good right like after a certain
01:54:53.80 --> 01:54:58.84 the percentage of what is it what is it what makes dark chocolate better right it's like a certain
01:54:58.84 --> 01:55:04.76 percentage of dark chocolate in life yeah yeah because there's no sugar in it if you just get
01:55:04.76 --> 01:55:10.76 straight dark chocolate right but then there's like 80% 80% that's like the threshold let me
01:55:10.76 --> 01:55:16.44 know if you're doing this way 80% is is good when you get to 72% you're like you're like oh that's
01:55:16.44 --> 01:55:21.64 just a tasty you know you're just eating dessert 80% it's not quite it still give you a
01:55:21.64 --> 01:55:29.40 chocolate satisfaction but it's not like the same. If you eat two squares of 80% chocolate you
01:55:29.40 --> 01:55:34.84 won't desire more if you eat two squares of 72% chocolate you like I'm gonna have a little bit more
01:55:34.84 --> 01:55:42.84 yeah okay perfect so so the the milk with a don't milk my question to you in your opinion
01:55:42.84 --> 01:55:50.28 your juggle discipline opinion if I put a chunk because like last night I put this chunk
01:55:50.28 --> 01:55:55.56 there's this chunk I don't know why it was there was there chunk a chocolate it wasn't 80% in the
01:55:55.56 --> 01:56:00.44 blender I didn't put the whole thing I broke off a little piece so it's maybe like a the size of a
01:56:00.44 --> 01:56:06.84 uh two you know the little baby snickers bars two of those I would say that's how big the
01:56:06.84 --> 01:56:13.88 chunk this block of chocolate two of the baby snickers yeah it was a big munchache those like three
01:56:13.88 --> 01:56:19.64 scoops okay you know like you know the 30 ounce yeah the mugs that we have four anyway
01:56:21.08 --> 01:56:26.44 put it in with a peanut butter chocolate munk and it didn't hand-stit oh yeah well of course
01:56:26.44 --> 01:56:32.44 so the question is is like how much of a violate like if it's 80% chocolate
01:56:32.44 --> 01:56:38.44 or a dark 80% dark chocolate but you didn't put 80% dark I know but that's a sugar chocolate
01:56:38.44 --> 01:56:44.60 no matter what I did I didn't do I'm saying theoretically if I did 80% or more chocolate
01:56:44.60 --> 01:56:48.76 that's good that's still within the confines I'd say you're not the path in the game right
01:56:48.76 --> 01:56:54.04 say you're in the game in on the path okay 80% so if when we come across 80% chocolate
01:56:54.04 --> 01:56:59.08 let's add that just collectively let's add that and see how we all feel about that that's what I think
01:56:59.08 --> 01:57:04.36 check you get the little chips at the bottom of the cup too it's pretty cool check also I just
01:57:04.36 --> 01:57:10.60 talk to a guy strawberry or further warrior kid mulk if your kid is lactose intolerant
01:57:11.56 --> 01:57:17.80 you put him on the almond milk right so get some of that do you get also if you want to
01:57:17.80 --> 01:57:29.16 represent on the path jocquoise store called jocquoise store so we can get shirts hats hoodies tank tops
01:57:29.16 --> 01:57:34.20 more rash guards recommended still within within the confines of being in the game or rash
01:57:34.20 --> 01:57:40.60 guards as well if you want to represent in the wild on the path and in the wild the same
01:57:40.60 --> 01:57:48.04 jocquoise store dot com so you can get some cool stuff all jocquo proved all of it women stuff
01:57:48.04 --> 01:57:52.60 on there is by the way there is counterfeit jocquo stuff yeah but here's the thing about the
01:57:52.60 --> 01:57:57.72 bunch fit here's the thing about the counterfeit once they're like if you all you have to do
01:57:57.72 --> 01:58:05.40 here I dig it like you you'll see a cool design that seems new because that's really the
01:58:05.40 --> 01:58:11.56 what you call it the visceral that's negative right that like the immediate responses like oh new
01:58:11.56 --> 01:58:17.56 design on amazon or wherever these kind of it exists you see the new design so you kind of oh
01:58:17.56 --> 01:58:23.40 cool and you in your in your haste you click on it but here's the thing if you just stop for one second
01:58:23.96 --> 01:58:29.64 you can be aggressive but not full hearty right that's the deal so you take this one moment to
01:58:29.64 --> 01:58:35.48 recognize the design you'll know there's violations all through every single design on there first off
01:58:35.48 --> 01:58:41.72 the font is like the completely wrong font it's completely wrong then I saw one like the good one
01:58:41.72 --> 01:58:49.48 right that's on like you know one of these one of these websites that you can go to and you submit
01:58:49.48 --> 01:58:57.72 your pdf or jpeg and it generates a shirt for you it's like it's a super cheap thing
01:58:57.72 --> 01:59:01.64 so there's one of those not here forget what it's called but it's one of those where it's like
01:59:01.64 --> 01:59:07.56 obviously cheap and the design's wrong it's backwards ours is backwards the good says is backwards
01:59:07.56 --> 01:59:12.28 it's how it's supposed to be there's ones all frontwards like just some person who didn't pay attention
01:59:12.28 --> 01:59:17.48 is trying to do it it's real obvious if you take that second to notice it though so the
01:59:17.48 --> 01:59:24.28 counterfeit ones you know there you go so just look out for the counterfeit ones yeah they're out there
01:59:24.28 --> 01:59:31.48 also do you won't get counterfeit ones at jacquistart.com correct yeah actually actually also
01:59:31.48 --> 01:59:36.68 jacquo it is their counterfeit jacquo it is not so that's not gonna be a lot harder to
01:59:36.68 --> 01:59:42.20 cut yeah you gotta you gotta put some effort into that one yeah you don't have to get labels
01:59:42.20 --> 01:59:47.40 done I would actually be kind of impressed like like slightly just in your mode of getting
01:59:47.40 --> 01:59:54.04 after it would be high level yeah because it's not easy to make tea no not easy make cans of tea no
01:59:55.24 --> 02:00:00.28 it is not easy to the deadlift 8000 pounds unless you've been drinking your tea so you get some

02:01:26.68 --> 02:01:33.64 which is called jockel podcast and that's where these videos are of this podcast if you
02:01:33.64 --> 02:01:39.56 want to see what Dennis Rally looks like how tall he is can you tell that from a video where he's sitting
02:01:39.56 --> 02:01:44.68 down he was kind of going out of frame like like sit up yeah so yes he's can't do it yeah
02:01:44.68 --> 02:01:50.04 he's a big dude full of a loa by the way yeah of waifu a loa but yeah if you want to see what
02:01:50.04 --> 02:01:58.04 what Dennis Rally looks like and you can come on there you can also see echoes enhanced videos as he likes to
02:01:58.04 --> 02:02:03.88 call him he thinks it's an enhancement when he adds stuff to him you think it takes it away I
02:02:03.88 --> 02:02:08.68 didn't take away from the message I heard that yeah over that people have actually told you that
02:02:08.68 --> 02:02:13.48 well I don't agree with it I'll tell you what totally changed my attitude is the is the
02:02:13.48 --> 02:02:21.000 mic in the dragon video okay that video is sick the video that you made is it and that video I said
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.04 to myself even this is more powerful even like you know you never really think about what you think
02:02:26.04 --> 02:02:32.04 about it but like the background music like when when it says the king diesness like chelokic
02:02:32.04 --> 02:02:39.48 so to the background of like December yeah well that that is a good point and you are kind of
02:02:39.48 --> 02:02:47.000 advanced in your thinking because really to put kind of to put it kind of precisely the goal is
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.96 it's not necessarily to be like hey what's the background music supposed to be it's like what's
02:02:51.96 --> 02:02:56.36 the feeling supposed to be and then you know I'll certain instruments for music or whatever will
02:02:56.36 --> 02:03:01.000 provide certain feelings and you know that's kind of the goal to line them up that's it so then
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.24 you recognize that so that video has definitely impressed upon me that video is can't have a positive
02:03:07.24 --> 02:03:14.92 impact and positively enhance to use your term what's going on with the words that are in the
02:03:14.92 --> 02:03:23.32 video yeah but what about if I put like the walls crumbling and crashing down see and you see
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:28.44 that over the whole time you happen to expose see does that take away from you like one of those
02:03:28.44 --> 02:03:33.80 people that got carried away with CGI on that video yeah which I you know you got to explore the boundaries
02:03:33.80 --> 02:03:39.64 yes sometimes you go out to I see on a recent video that I did I'm not gonna say which one but I
02:03:39.64 --> 02:03:44.68 did the same thing but now with crumbling and crashing noises and effects I did it with lens flare
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:49.08 you know lens flare is right oh yes I do like the goal lens flare somebody puts a light in front of
02:03:49.08 --> 02:03:53.48 the camera yeah well it's the the aberrations or I don't know whatever the word you want to use that
02:03:53.48 --> 02:03:59.40 that a light going directly at the camera will create these like you know little and you can do it on
02:03:59.40 --> 02:04:03.64 purpose right it's like a look it's like an epic look when you get what's called an animal
02:04:03.64 --> 02:04:08.76 thick lens it kind of does this thing it compresses it to the side kind of thing and then when you
02:04:09.80 --> 02:04:14.12 to put in laminas terms basically when you put the video did you do this on I can't tell you
02:04:14.76 --> 02:04:19.24 now we're not gonna watch all my videos yeah yeah go watch all the videos you tell me but here's
02:04:19.24 --> 02:04:23.64 why I don't want to say it because now people will be paying attention to it and they'll be like oh yeah
02:04:23.64 --> 02:04:30.12 you're right because okay not to go into a whole long thing but okay so there's a guy named JJ Abram
02:04:30.12 --> 02:04:35.56 he's a director and I think a writer too but anyway he does he did like the new start trick
02:04:35.56 --> 02:04:42.12 movies did the new start wars you know he's like kind of a sci-fi guy and he got a lot of
02:04:42.12 --> 02:04:48.44 he got a lot people had an issue with the amount of lens flare is he allowed in start trick
02:04:48.44 --> 02:04:54.20 the newer star so clear everywhere I thought I thought I really dope man I really like that look
02:04:54.20 --> 02:04:59.56 but he got a lot of you know a lot of shit for it nonetheless I don't want to be in that same
02:04:59.56 --> 02:05:04.12 boat with these videos with that particular video that I'm talking about so if they don't notice
02:05:04.12 --> 02:05:12.36 then good if so then that seems same I'm gonna go post about it nonetheless psychological warfare
02:05:12.36 --> 02:05:17.96 too which is an album with tracks where I tell you what you should do to push through the moment
02:05:17.96 --> 02:05:25.08 of weakness and that's all we're gonna say about that okay it works with a hundred percent
02:05:25.08 --> 02:05:30.12 certainty I'll add that are you still batting a hundred percent right now we'll get that I'm
02:05:30.12 --> 02:05:35.40 gonna call I'm gonna call yeah you on that oh hundred percent every single time I've ever
02:05:35.40 --> 02:05:42.60 used it recently because it's like are you scared of it I didn't I didn't need it I don't have
02:05:42.60 --> 02:05:49.80 many moments weakness nowadays see I'm like forged in the fire of discipline no transgressions
02:05:51.08 --> 02:05:53.88 are you trying to set yourself up to make a video with flare for yourself
02:05:54.52 --> 02:06:00.28 that's not a good no no no I'm reporting back to you my current status on my discipline
02:06:00.28 --> 02:06:06.36 nonetheless I haven't had to use it recently so yeah I mean doesn't matter if every single time
02:06:06.36 --> 02:06:11.56 that I've used it it yeah it helps like what I'm gonna do listen to you telling me and then like
02:06:11.56 --> 02:06:17.08 oh yeah I'm stupid you know to me just making the effort to open my ears to you is already
02:06:17.08 --> 02:06:25.16 like on the way like power through yeah exactly right check so you know hundred percent on that one
02:06:25.16 --> 02:06:32.04 in my experience also you want to very up your workout on it fitness gear is at on it dot
02:06:32.04 --> 02:06:37.64 com they got a lot of cool stuff on there a lot of good stuff so if you want to improve in hands
02:06:37.64 --> 02:06:45.72 it's very increase variables increase stuff in your workout if it's getting boring or something
02:06:45.72 --> 02:06:53.24 like this got on it dot com gets something from there like kettle pills or rings or battle ropes
02:06:53.80 --> 02:06:58.44 I think if you add one or more of those things into your workout it'll be enhanced greatly
02:06:58.44 --> 02:07:05.48 results wise my opinion my prediction also books what do we got well first of all we got
02:07:05.48 --> 02:07:09.40 Mike in dragons told you about the video go watch the video and then you'll want to get the book
02:07:09.40 --> 02:07:12.92 why because I could get a really good job and thanks because the book is legit
02:07:14.04 --> 02:07:16.44 am I allowed to say that about my own book or is that make me arrogant
02:07:18.12 --> 02:07:21.000 yeah no from what I've been told it's legit
02:07:21.72 --> 02:07:25.08 everyone appreciates book and a bunch of people have now started posting
02:07:26.36 --> 02:07:32.28 reviews on amazon which is very cool I appreciate it I've read them and I'll read some next time live
02:07:32.28 --> 02:07:38.20 but yeah so so Mike in the dragons here's the deal is it sold out at this moment in time yes
02:07:38.20 --> 02:07:43.000 will it be sold out when you hear this probably not actually it's probably we got more books coming in
02:07:43.56 --> 02:07:49.64 getting imprinted it's quickly as they can possibly print them and I apologize for not
02:07:50.76 --> 02:07:56.36 correctly estimating how many books everyone would buy that is my fault and I apologize for it
02:07:56.36 --> 02:08:03.32 but if you do want Mike in the dragons order it as soon as you can so that you can get it as quickly
02:08:03.32 --> 02:08:06.20 as possible also the way the warrior kid books
02:08:07.48 --> 02:08:15.48 way the warrior kid and marks mission those books are good for kids and adults and really anyone
02:08:15.48 --> 02:08:20.36 and you know just got done talking to talking to Dennis rally downstairs and he's like oh
02:08:20.36 --> 02:08:25.56 yeah I read those books they're awesome so he's he's a what I don't know how old he is
02:08:25.56 --> 02:08:30.68 but he's a Vietnam veteran pilot and he read warrior kids and was was down for the cost
02:08:31.32 --> 02:08:34.92 that's weird you said down for the cause because I was thinking in my head down for the cause
02:08:34.92 --> 02:08:39.80 yeah well he is clearly you know down for the cause yeah this may go to freedom field manual
02:08:40.84 --> 02:08:47.32 good one outstanding one actually I think so again and I said this before I'm saying again
02:08:47.32 --> 02:08:52.52 because this is a constant thing it's like one of those things like a manual like an actual manual
02:08:52.52 --> 02:08:58.60 for life but so okay you said that I get it but yeah you refer to it that's what you do it's like
02:08:58.60 --> 02:09:04.84 a reminder and we do this all the time by the way but this is a good one to just remember because that's
02:09:04.84 --> 02:09:10.20 part of the the actually it's the majority of the challenge right there it's to remember this stuff
02:09:10.76 --> 02:09:18.52 like say hey you shouldn't freaking drink a soda right now with your sushi don't do that you know
02:09:18.52 --> 02:09:22.28 that are any but if it's just part of the habit it's like boom you might forget because you're thinking
02:09:22.28 --> 02:09:27.24 about some other stuff you know some edits or whatever that you had to do same so you got that
02:09:27.24 --> 02:09:33.64 manual there this time and you just refer to it kind of maybe even daily semi daily
02:09:33.64 --> 02:09:39.000 I recommend daily daily yeah and you just remember all this stuff just keeps you on the path man
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.60 that one isn't print by the way just plenty of them so you can order that one and
02:09:44.60 --> 02:09:51.80 that's a good Christmas gift yeah for people that you know who needs it in your world you know what I mean
02:09:51.80 --> 02:09:56.92 and I don't think it's insulting well by the way if someone is offended by it just get him to crack it open
02:09:57.48 --> 02:10:03.16 because I'll realize like hey this isn't meant to offend this is meant to build yeah and actually
02:10:03.16 --> 02:10:09.16 you know what now that you think of it that book isn't like extreme ownership might be that kind of
02:10:09.16 --> 02:10:13.48 book that if you get it with something for someone they'll be like what are you sure you know like we'll
02:10:13.48 --> 02:10:19.80 elicit what it called defensiveness yeah but the field manual won't because like first when you
02:10:19.80 --> 02:10:24.92 first see it you're like oh this is awesome just I don't seem saying like looking at it but it's like
02:10:24.92 --> 02:10:31.000 yeah it's like a cool like field manual it doesn't scream like you need to take responsibility for
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.68 stuff that's why I'm here it just you don't get that feel but even even if that person might
02:10:36.68 --> 02:10:43.64 feel that maybe you got to do it with like a certain type of card or something soon as they yeah
