00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 12 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:28.000 Sometimes people ask me, what made me me? How did I turn out like this where did I come from?
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000 And I go back and I point at hardcore music grown up and I've been in that scene where it was cool to be hard and strong.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000 It was about a crescent and disciplined. Those were like the underlying theme. So I pointed that, you know.
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000 And I think that's real.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000 There was mantras that I remember from those days that stuck with me my whole life from some of those from some of that music.
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000 And then there's other things that influenced me as a kid, that had even even a younger age.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000 And one of the things that I know influenced me at a very young age in a pretty significant way was seeing the movie,
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000 Bridge on the river choir, which is a classic war movie.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000 And that movie pretty much had it all for me.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000 And I think I can trace my ideas of being a commando.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000 I'm going to use that word. You know, that's kind of a archaic word that people don't use anymore.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.000 I don't know, man, though, but I think I got it from watching that movie when I was a kid. And if you haven't seen that movie, you should check it out for sure because it's epic.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:07.000 And it's the story of prisoners of war and American and British mostly British that are sent to build a bridge in the middle of the jungle in Burma.
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000 And it's a train line that is to connect bankoc and rain, goon.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000 And of course, these are prisoners. So they're badly mistreated. They're beaten, they're poorly fed.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000 Eventually, one American escapes. And he leads a commando troop back to the side of the bridge to blow up the bridge.
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000 And they do it all. The commando is in the movie. They do it all. They perish you in. They swim up the river.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000 They lay demolition on the bridge. It's like a dream operation.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And one part of the plot, though, is that the senior British officer at the camp, the senior prisoner at the camp,
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000 these name and the movie is the 10-occurnal Nicholson. He takes a true leadership role in building the bridge.
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000 Now, think about that. He's being tasked by the Japanese to build this bridge. And instead of sabotaging the job,
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000 because it's going to help the Japanese, he actually gets his men fired up and helps organize and has his engineers redesign it.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000 And they relocate it to a better piece of terrain. And he pushes his men to do a good job building it.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000 And he actually takes pride in this bridge. And again, this is a bridge that's going to aid in Japanese domination.
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000 So when the commando's show up to blow it up, the colonel, he, he almost foils the attack.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000 But in the end, the bridge gets destroyed. It's an awesome movie.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000 And it was, like I said, it was very influential to me as a kid, and people should definitely watch it.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000 And then you should know this. It's all alive.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000 What's all alive?
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000 Well, there really was a bridge on the riverkway.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000 And it really was built by prisoners of war. But that's about where the similarities end.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000 What the prisoners suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese guards is beyond anything that they showed in the movie.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:37.000 And really beyond anything that even remotely civilized person could imagine.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.000 I was, I was overseas recently. And you're up and I was in Britain. And a friend of mine gave me a book called The Forgotten Highlander.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000 And he told me, you know, oh, it's by one of the soldiers that built the bridge on the riverkway, read it.
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000 And I thought to myself, okay, you know, great. It's like the movie.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000 And he said, it's not like the movie. It's not like the movie at all.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:14.000 And it isn't. This is a book that shows the ultimate in human suffering.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.000 And through that, the ultimate in human will.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:47.000 The author, Alistair, your cart was fresh to the British military. He was sent to Singapore. And when Singapore was overrun by the Japanese Imperial Army, he ended up in the jungle, a prisoner and a slave.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:58.000 By this time, mental health had become a major issue on the railway. We all suffered from depression. Men were taking their own lives.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:11.000 All along the railway, men cut their own throats, put their heads on the railway line, and simply walked into the jungle to die.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:21.000 Many developed the A-Tap Stair and just looked intently at the faturew of the hut. Death soon followed.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:32.000 Others went mad because of medical conditions caused by vitamin deficiencies. And some just gave up, losing their minds and their self-control.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000 They would fight with anyone over nothing at all, throwing punches, biting, kicking. They needed to be controlled physically.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:54.000 But just could not become down. It came to a point where something drastic had to be done to prevent innocent men being killed by deranged fellow prisoners.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:05.000 Some of whom had revered to animal instincts. The decision was made to build our own lunatic asylum to cage these poor souls.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000 With the agreement of the Japanese, the burial party built two six-foot square bamboo cages.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:26.000 The mad men could stand or lie down in these just ten feet from my hut, and they had a bench to sit on. They received food and water, but sadly were largely ignored.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000 At night it was awful to hear them in the darkness jabbering and screaming, throwing themselves at the cages.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:47.000 The men who went in never came out alive. Death would have been welcomed for them. It was a dreadful thing to see our fellow human beings cage like animals.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000 But what else could we do?
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:19.000 As I was preparing for this in a lot of times when I'm putting notes together, thinking about something that I'm going to say, some comparable thing that I can bring back from some of my experiences.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:32.000 When I got nothing for you, I got nothing for you. And this book is just like that.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000 Back to the book.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:48.000 I turned to God several times, often I felt my prayers went unanswered, but I somehow lived through this madness, and I think that someone must have been listening.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:01.000 Faith and God could not prevent the beatings on the railway, which were totally routine. The threat of a rifle butt across your head or bamboo cane across your body forever loomed large.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000 For no reason at all, wire wips would lash into our backs and draw blood.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000 Some guards would creep up on you and strike the open tropical ulcers on your legs with a bamboo stick, causing intense agony.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000 Often they delivered these beatings with such brutality and swiftness that you did not see them coming, or even know that they were what they were for.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000 Sometimes you just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Korean guards took a certain pleasure in the beatings.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:43.000 They had expressed permission to kill prisoners without any reference to higher authority, but most of them would be satisfied to stop at the sight of a blood trickling.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000 The beatings no matter how frequent, never got easier to take.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:58.000 In fact, they got tougher. Each time I took a beating it chipped away, not just at my bones and waning muscles, but at my will to endure them.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000 The dilemma was whether to swallow your pride by going down at the first blow, or to retain some of your dignity by taking several blows and standing up to them.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:23.000 If you refuse to show that their blows were hurting you, they would fly into rages, and the beating could be severe, even fatal.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:34.000 From an early period, the Japanese camp common-dont, whom I called the Black Prince, became ever more inventive with his punishments.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000 I could not imagine a more sadistic and evil person on the planet. The more heinous the so-called crime, the sicker the sentence.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:56.000 Under his instructions, the guards had free reign. If they felt you deserved something more than a beating, it meant taking you aside and making you pick up a large boulder.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:07.000 For the rest of the day you had to hold the rock over your head in the blazing heat. Within minutes you're already weak in malnourished arms would start to twitch and fail you.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000 Before long, you would have to drop the rock, usually the size of a rugby ball or football, mindful so that you did so without letting it fall on your own skull.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:29.000 When you let go the guards would pounce, fists, rifle butts, and boots, flailing into your body until you picked up the rock again. It would go on all day.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.000 And if the Japanese officer did not think you had learned your lesson sufficiently, the punishment would be repeated back at camp.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000 The black prince was a true bastard. Others called him the can you kid, but I thought my name suited Lieutenant Usuki really well.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:03.000 He was darker than the other Japanese soldiers and strut it around like royalty, his beefy gut protruding from beneath the shabby uniform. He despised us totally. We were scum to him.
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000 His absolute power over us and capacity for pitilessness, for pitiless brutality made him so terrifying to me.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:25.000 Long before our decision to incarcerate crazy men, the Japanese had built their own cages. The black holes, as they were known, were a higher form of punishment.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:39.000 Those fortunate enough to be locked inside the scent that those unfortunate enough to be locked inside the semi-subterranean cages, proportion so you could not stand, lie down, or even kneel fully.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:59.000 Would be kept in for a month typically, corrugated iron and metal covered the bamboo to intensify the heat and deprived victims of air and any cooling breeze. Few who went in came out alive.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Yeah, it's unbelievable.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Unbelievable.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:34.000 The black prince's right hand man was sergeant, Sachi, known to us brit simply as Dr. Death. Short and squat, he took the roll calls and carried out all of the camp common-downs orders.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:49.000 Presumably he was more educated than the other Japanese or Koreans, but he was evil to the marrow. Ruflus in the extreme he loved tormenting us. He especially reveled in a sickening brand of water torture.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:03.000 He had guards pinned down his hapless victim before pouring gallons of water down the prisoners throat using a bucket and a hose. The man's stomach would swell up from huge volumes of water.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:18.000 He would then jump up and down gleefully on the prisoners stomach. Sometimes the guards tied barbed wire around the poor soul's stomach. Few survived.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:38.000 When a prisoner was caught stealing from the Japanese officer's store room, or if a man turned on a guard, they received the next grade on the sliding scale of Japanese torture.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:49.000 I called it the Indian rope trick, one favored by Indians in the old cowboy films. The helpless prisoner would be tethered spread eagle to the ground.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:01.000 They wrapped wet raton. The same string-like bark used to lash our bamboo huts together, around his ankles and wrists, and tied him to stakes in the ground.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.000 As the raton dried, the ties would slowly gash into the skin, drawing blood and tearing into the sinu and cartilage as it pulled limbs from their sockets.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:19.000 It reduced even the toughest men to agonize screaming, and they would be there all day.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:28.000 I would almost be glad to get out of camp in the mornings just to avoid hearing their cries of unbridled pain.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:38.000 It was a way of torturing all of us. Often, when we return from a day on the railway, the men would no longer be there.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Nobody asked where they had vanished to. I certainly did not want to know. After such a horrific ordeal, at the end of a Japanese bayonet, would have been welcomed.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000 The men would have been there all day.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000 They would have been there all day.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000 They would have been there all day.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:21.000 So, as time went on, eventually, when they showed up, they had their pants, their shirt, their boots, their socks, and as time went on, they all that stuff just got destroyed,
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000 and they were going to go to the jungle as they worked and eventually fell apart.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:43.000 And one of the worst things to lose is the last thing that Alistar lost was his boots.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Now, in bare feet, I had a new challenge. My feet were extremely soft from living constantly in wet boots, and the ground was particularly unforgiving.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000 The jagged volcanic rocks often hiding just below the surface of top soil.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000 I knew that the soils would harden up, but until then, I would have to walk like a cripple.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000 When using the spade, I wouldn't be able to use my foot to dig deeper into the soil and would have and would require more upper body strength.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000 Having no boots also made the ever frequent trips to the benios, the latrines, even more unsavory.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 They were revolting.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000 Vast open pits, later covered in, after weakened prisoners began to collapse into them and drown.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000 As you approached the benios, you had to wade through the mud, layered with excrement of those disinterest sufferers who never were quite made it.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Flies and maggots and flies and maggots swarmed and wriggled over this foul mush.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000 It got so bad that we had a bucket of water at the entrance to wash our hut, to wash our feet in.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000 It all added to the misery.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000 It's amazing what we take for granted, isn't it?
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000 Yeah, to say the least.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:23.000 And he goes on to talk about, and if you, how do you deal with this when you're going through it?
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:33.000 And he writes, in moments of adversity, I would often think back to my childhood and remember going barefoot during the long hot summers.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000 We spent down at the Aberdeen, Aberdeen's your fishing village of Newton Hill, where I was born.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000 So there he is, you know, having to go barefoot as feet practically falling off.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:58.000 And the best thing he can do is try and think of the good times in his life when he was forced to go barefoot.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:11.000 And you'd think you'd think some level of camaraderie would be critical.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:22.000 And this is one of those books where again, in almost every military book you, it's to hear about leadership and camaraderie.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000 And there's points in this book where that stuff fails.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000 Fails.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000 And this is where he kind of talks about that back to the book.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000 I even cast a gate in myself for getting involved with another prisoner's problems.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000 Once you got started with sentimentality and grief, you were a goner.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000 It was a selfish tactic, but I was desperate to survive.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000 I was refusing to let the Japanese win this.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Like on the death march, some men found the going easier by teaming up and making a close bond with another prisoner.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000 They would fight railway life together, sharing whatever food they had, helping each other, wherever they could, and always having their back.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000 They even took beatings together to share the blows and the pain.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000 It was not the way for me.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000 I watched the hardache of men losing their best pals and suddenly being left alone.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000 They never usually lasted very long and soon followed their mates to the grave.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:44.000 By now, the cuts on my feet and legs had turned into painful and dangerous tropical ulcers.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:54.000 When I suffered scrapes on the railway or had a rush, I could not tend to it until, yes, some time, which is like rest time or ad-ease time.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.000 On a warrantile I was back at camp, then I wrapped leaves around the cuts at night to keep the flies off, but it was useless, and the ulcers usually spread.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000 They routed your flesh, muscle, and tendons.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:19.000 People were left with gaping holes as the flesh simply fell away, and also would eat deep into your flesh, so deep you could sometimes see the white of bone.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:39.000 Even worse, if you are not careful, they could become gangrenees, and many men lost legs that way, by improvised amputation, without anesthetics or drugs.
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:49.000 I went to the medical hut for advice. In common with most of the men tropical ulcers had engulfed my feet, ankles, and lower calves.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000 I had avoided the medical hut until that point. It was set aside from the sleeping huts and about the same size as ours.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:07.000 The officer in charge was Dr. Mathison, a likable character from pastely just outside Glasgow, where he had studied medicine.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.000 He had come to Singapore about the same time as me, and would later in much different circumstances save my life.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000 On this, my first encounter with him, he would at least save my legs.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000 Sneaking under the cloud of black flies that circled outside the hut like a swarm of miniature volatures I entered nervously.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000 The overpowering stench immediately had me gasping. Stepping across the cadaverous forms of five or six men who appeared to be wrapping a deathstore,
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.000 Dr. Mathison introduced himself. I had not spoken for so many days that when I went to reply, my parched throat failed me.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000 Here, he said, handing me a half coconut cup of water. Get this down you.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000 I sip the cool water down and thanked him, asking how his patients were.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:16.000 Dr. Mathison, it is mid-30s at this point, appeared weary beyond his ears. He was probably on self-imposed half rations just to keep some spare for his patients.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000 The men had spoke highly of him, and many of our doctors were revered as saintly figures.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:35.000 The doctor took me by the arm and led me down to the far end of the hut, away from the men. In a soft, west coast accent, he said, half of these men will die within days.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:47.000 The other half, who knows? If I had access to some proper clinical treatments, drugs or instruments, they might live, but that is not possible as I'm sure you know.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000 I could only nod in agreement. The squaller and stench of death inside the hut was appalling.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:11.000 What can you do for them? I asked. Quite simply not a lot. I try and give them some hope if nothing else.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000 He went on. It's easy for these men to give up, and when they lose hope, the fight just seems to seep right out of them.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:30.000 On countless occasions, I've seen two men with the same symptoms and the same physical state, and one will die, and one will make it.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:46.000 I can only put that down to sheer willpower.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:11.000 We do talk about willpower. I don't think we've ever discussed willpower at this level, and that is when you have two men with the same symptoms in the same physical state, and one dies and one lives, and the doctor's only determination as he thinks it comes down to sheer willpower.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000 The will is strong. It is a strong force.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:29.000 I considered this for a moment and looked around the hut. You could tell the men who are dying by the look on their faces.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:38.000 Their gaze was lost before it reached their eyes, and no amount of positive attitude and care from Dr. Matthewson could change their destiny.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000 It certainly was not the medical staff's fault. Their hands were tied.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:02.000 No blood was firmly on our cappers' hands. I told myself right then and there that I would not stop fighting.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000 What can you do for this? I asked the doctor lifting a foot onto a bamboo chair.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000 Tropical ice, tropical alcers, a disease of food, filth, and friction.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000 Do you know what maggots look like?
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:36.000 maggots I asked, frantically inspecting my foot praying that I was subject to some sick joke? Yes, maggots. They'll fix you right up. Go down to the latrines, find yourself a handful of those wee white beasties and set them on your ulcers.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000 They will chop through the dead flesh before you know it. You'll be right as rain.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:54.000 Almost as an afterthought he added, remember to count how many you put on carefully. You don't want to forget one and leaving it there to eat itself to death.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000 I left the medical hut shaking my head still wondering if I were being had.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000 Letting maggots eat my skin did not sound particularly appetizing, but I was willing to try anything.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000 I knew I had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000 But latrines were nothing more than holes in the ground, but now with bamboo slats across them.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:27.000 A bunch of jungle leaves usually laid piled near or you took your own foliage or toilet paper if there was no river water collected for the job.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:36.000 I did not have to go far to find what I was looking for. I genuinely scooped up a handful of maggots watching them squirm and wriggle.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:46.000 Without thinking about it too much I found a quiet spot nearby and sat down placing just two or three out of nasty ulcer on my ankle.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000 The maggots which were about a quarter of an inch long instinctively knew what to do.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000 They started knowing away at my skin and the most with the most miniscule of bites.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000 The sensation was of tingling unearthly yet not altogether unpleasant.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000 Until the realization that the maggots were eating your raw flesh came racing back to the forefront of your mind,
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000 I can still feel that sensation to this day.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000 But to Dr. Matthews since credit it certainly worked.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000 Within days the wounds started to heal and new skin grew back.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000 It was a trick that I persisted with throughout my time on a railway passing on to other men when I thought I could.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000 They still use that today by the way. The maggots think.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000 Yeah. Why have heard of it?
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000 That's crazy how he was kind of like, I'll never forget that feeling of the maggots.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000 But he talked about it as not being totally unpleasant kind of like that.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Yeah. But because he knew it was kind of healing them, you know?
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000 Yeah.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000 I don't know.
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000 That's heavy, brother, to me.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000 Yeah.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000 So now we get into a guy that had tried to escape and was captured.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000 I was unaware that anyone had escaped until one morning a sorry looking chap was dragged before us.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000 He had been horrifically beaten, his swollen and bloody features virtually unrecognizable.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.000 The interpreter told us, this man very bad. He tried to escape. No good.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000 Two guards threw him down on the ground in front of us.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000 The battered wreck of a human frame and made him kneel.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000 He did not plead for mercy or beg for assistance.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000 He knew his fate and waited silently, resigned to it.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000 The black prince who seemed to have dressed up especially for the occasion,
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000 strode forward and un-sheathed his long samurai sword.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000 He prodded the prisoner in the back, forcing him to straighten up.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000 Then the black prince raised his sword, it's stainless steel glinted in the sunshine.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000 It was a moment of such horror that I could scarcely believe it was really happening.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000 I closed my eyes tightly.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:38.000 This was one of the many instances of barbarism on the railway that I would try to shut out of my mind.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000 But I could not escape the chilling swish of the blade as it cut through the damp tropical air
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000 or the sickening thwack of the sword coming down on our comrades neck.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000 Followed by the dull thump of his head landing on the ground.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:10.000 I kept my eyes firmly shut, but swayed on my feet and felt a collective gasp of impotent anger and revulsion.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:21.000 And that line right there is something that when I heard it and when I read it,
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000 I kind of fought to myself that this is what separates every experience I've had in my life with this.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000 And that is this gasp of impotent anger and revulsion.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000 So the anger is there, the revulsion is there, but it's impotent.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000 And you can't do anything about it because you're a slave and you're at the mercy of another human being.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:57.000 Your freedom has been taken away.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:07.000 You can't talk about freedom fairly often.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:17.000 And I don't think there could be any greater reminder of how precious freedom is
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:38.000 than reading about someone, about a group of men that have had their freedom completely taken from them.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:48.000 Now, at this point in the book, and I wanted to point this out because if you have seen the movie, the bridge on the river choir,
00:32:48.000 --> 00:33:01.000 he makes some, he kind of spells out the differences.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:12.000 The building of the bridge on the river choir took a terrible toll on us and the depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was a very, very sanitized version of the events.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000 Unlike the well-fed extras in the movie, we did not whistle Colonel Bogey to.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:35.000 A noted we work alongside Americans, known we have any semblance of a uniform. We were naked, barefoot slaves. And there were certainly no pretty and scannily-clad local girls wandering through the jungle.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000 And contrary to the film, our real-life commander Colonel Philip Tuzzi did not collaborate with the Japanese.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.000 I was not alone in doing as little work as possible without blatantly shirking, which resulted in sadistic beatings.
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000 Energy every ounce of it had to be conserved for survival.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:06.000 To bust a gut on starvation rations was absolute suicide. We had long lost our dignity and working faster certainly would not have brought it back.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000 In fact, it would have resulted in us in the opposite, but even more of us dying.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000 Instead we made constant attempts to sabotage.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000 Man whispered to orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000 Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough, which would later have disastrous effects.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000 We collected huge numbers of termites and white ants and deposited them into grooves and joints of load bearing trucks.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:51.000 Out of sight of guards, I saw it halfway through wooden bolts wherever possible, hoping they would snap whenever any serious weight like a train was placed upon them.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:00.000 But the riverquie and its tributaries harbored a killer even more lethal than the Japanese and our starvation diet.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:19.000 As an inevitable consequence of the lack of sanitation and the tens of thousands of bodies buried in shallow graves or dumped along in the jungle, the river system was loaded with cholera, bacteria, and the monsoon season became cholera season.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:29.000 As the heightened waters of the Kuei of the Kui flushed Vibrio Chloria throughout the land,
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000 this fearful disease cast a black shadow over the camp.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000 cholera arrived unseen and unheard, but soon had us in its grip.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000 I was slow to hear about it, but I sent something terrible was in the camp.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000 More men were falling ill than usual, and the Japanese kept their distance, leaving us alone.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:59.000 They were scared to death of catching cholera themselves.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000 So this wretched disease comes into camp.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000 And you just don't think things can get worse, and they do.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000 And you think that alisters get a avoid cholera?
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000 But he doesn't.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000 Over night, cholera struck me down.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000 I woke up with explosive diarrhea and violent projectile vomiting.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000 My ears were ringing as I felt dizzy.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000 Cramp started in my bowels and soon spread all over my body as it rapidly dehydrated.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000 I was drying from the inside out, shriveling like a picked grape left out in the sun.
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000 The cholera bacteria bird into the walls of my small intestine, producing toxins that sucked my vital salts,
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000 and every ounce of water out of my body.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000 I was unsure what was wrong, but I knew it was serious.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000 I did not want to finish up with life drained out of me.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000 I had always been extremely careful to drink only boiled water, so at first I was doubtful that it was cholera.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000 I did not know much about it, but I knew that the first 24 hours were crucial.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000 If you see through a day and a night, you would probably survive.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000 Most men who succumbed did so in the first few hours, a horrible death and so quick.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Men who threw the bodies of cholera victims onto the funeral pires in the morning could easily contract the disease, die,
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000 and be thrown on the pyre themselves that evening.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000 They died in agony like crazed animals, and it was dreadful to see.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000 I lay in my bed unable to rise for work party.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000 By then I was semi-conscious and I thought it was the end.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000 I was hallucinating.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000 Vivid Red Flash is stormed by eyelids.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000 I knew I had to seek help.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.000 After siking myself up, I managed to rise and wobble to doctor Matthewson's hut.
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000 As soon as I walked in he knew that I had cholera.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000 It was a death sentence and he was reluctant to tell me.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000 Instead he looked at me and simply said, you'll have to be isolated.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000 You'll be looked after.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000 His order leads led me to a creme colored of tent.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000 Like the ones we had used in the scouts.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000 As they peeled back the tent's front flap, a deathly stench leaped out.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000 Unknown to me, this was the death tent.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000 And I was the unlucky 13th occupant of a dimly lit space already full of men.
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000 When I saw their state, their eyes rolling back, rasping, unintelligible voices,
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000 their legs raised with knees bent.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000 The bizarre telltale side of a cholera sufferer.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 I knew that my number was up.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000 The orderlies were putting me here to die.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000 The fight was fading from me.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000 And I laid down on the canvas floor with a sense of complete and utter desolation.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000 But he did survive.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000 Out of the 13 men that went to the tent, he was the only survivor.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:40.000 Now, at this point in the book, and I want you to remember that this is a book.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000 This is another human being, his life.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.000 And at this point in Alistair's life, he actually got moved to another facility.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000 Another prison camp that was four people that weren't really bad, bad shape.
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000 And he was there.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000 He went through some recovery time.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:14.000 And that's a very important part of the book.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.000 And then he begins working on the docks, you know, unloading food stores for the Japanese soldier.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 And loading them.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:33.000 And eventually, it comes time for him to be moved.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000 And so they moved the prisoners of war by shipping them.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:49.000 On 4 September 1944, 900 British POWs were rushed up the gangway of the Kachadoki Maru.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000 A 10,000 ton cargo vessel that had been named for that had been named the President Harrison,
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000 before it was captured from the Americans.
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000 Using sticks, the Japanese drove us like cattle aboard the ship and down into the holds.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000 We could never move fast enough for them.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000 The liner had two holds, both quite obviously not made to accommodate human beings.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000 Yet they wanted around 450 of us in each.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000 The lads below were shouting, begging and pleading for the Japanese not to let in any more men.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:35.000 But the louder they shouted, the more frenzy the guards became down and down, we went into the depths of hell.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000 Nothing in all of our suffering had prepared me for anything like this.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:49.000 And even today, I can scarcely find the words to describe the horrors of the Kachadoki Maru.
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000 By the time I got down to the hold, I had nowhere to sit.
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000 It was standing room only, most of us packed in like stardines with no toilet facilities.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000 Most had dysentery, malaria, berry berry, and all manners of tropical diseases.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:18.000 Once inside, and the hold crammed full, the Japanese batten down the hatches plunging us into a terrifying black pit.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:26.000 At that moment, the most fearful clammer went up as claustrophobia and panic gripped the men.
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Many feared they were doomed and began screaming and shouting.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000 Yet a strange tranquility came over me.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000 I felt resigned and just thought this is it.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000 I thought that we would never get out alive and would never see home again.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000 You felt resigned to accept this as your last.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000 I could only think that they were taking us out to see to sink the ship and drown us all.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000 Our captors were capable of it.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000 I had seen what they were capable of anything.
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000 We knew nothing about these ships, which would become infamous in the annals of the second world war history as hellships.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000 A fleet of dozens of rusting hoax used to shuttle supplies and prisoners around Japan's far eastern empire.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Some of the most appalling episodes of the war occurred on these ships, in which men driven crazy by thirst, killed fellow prisoners to drink their blood.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:41.000 In some cases, prisoners trying to escape from the seething mass of hysterical captors were shot by Japanese soldiers.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000 Some voyages took weeks with only a handful of prisoners surviving.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000 Men drank their own urine.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000 Sick prisoners were trampled to death or suffocated.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000 The sane murdered the insane and wondered when it would be their turn to go mad.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Cannibalism as well as vampirism was not unknown and even Japanese medics were shocked by what they found when the holes were finally opened.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000 In the case of the Oroko Maru, we're in the same prisoners killed fellow man for their blood.
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000 Only 271 men survived out of 1,619.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:34.000 So all those times that you think of horror movies and they don't seem realistic and you don't think it could ever happen.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000 It has happened.
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:46.000 There must have been at least one officer, a worn officer, a sergeant major, somewhere in the hold, but they certainly didn't make themselves known.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:57.000 The discipline had gone. Everyone, whatever their rank was in the same situation, all of us just wanted to survive and were prepared to do anything to ensure that happened.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000 It would have taken a very brave man to try and take command of the men in the hold of these conditions.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000 It would have been suicidal.
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000 And again, that's one of those points where every book we've talked about no matter how bad things get.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000 There's a leader ready to step up.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000 Then you wonder if there's a line that you could ever go across where that doesn't happen.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000 Well, here it is.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.000 I thought I never thought anything could ever match the terror of the railway.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000 Being in the hold was worse.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000 At least, slaving on the railway, you could move and you had fresh air.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000 Then another dread thought struck me, submarines.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000 The catchy doku maru had no red cross markings painted on it.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:10.000 I would later learn that some that none of the hellships bore any indication that POWs were on board as they were required to do by Geneva Convention.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000 Red crosses were, however, painted on Japanese ammunition carriers.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:24.000 My fears that without markings, we were a target for our own side.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.000 So he starts thinking, well, we're part of the Japanese fleet now.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000 What if we get attacked by our own people?
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000 What if we get sunk?
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:53.000 And as you can probably foresee, because this story is just misery upon misery, it happens.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000 In the hold of the Kachidoki Maru, the torment went on.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000 The noise was constant and deafening, an awful cock-offening of robbing engines,
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.000 moaning, coughing, and occasional panic-stricken screaming, the background music for this latest torture.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000 The chilling screams of the mad and insane would stop abruptly.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000 I don't know how they were dealt with, but I could imagine.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000 I was completely stuck where I was in the hole and could not move.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000 No one could. You couldn't sit or lie down. You couldn't even go down to your haunches.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000 There was so little room. You didn't really want to lie down anyway.
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000 It was a sea of human waste and you risk being trampled.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000 You had your space and protected it with your life quite literally.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000 You stayed strong, protecting your space with elbows and fists.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000 By any means necessary. By this stage, it was every man for himself.
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Each person had their own problems to resolve their own life to save.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:09.000 Again, we have not seen this yet. Every man for himself.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.000 The smell inside the hole was indescribable or a pugnant stench,
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.000 an overpowering mixture of excrement, urine, vomit, sweaty bodies, weeping ulcers,
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000 and rotting flesh clogged the atmosphere.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000 There was no way we could get any fresh air.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000 Even when the Japanese open the hatches, it really didn't help that much.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000 You were still breathing in what was already there.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000 First became our biggest problem. People don't understand what real first truly is.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000 You start to hallucinate and see morages.
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000 And that is the most dangerous thing. People died down in the holes from suffocation or heart attacks.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:09.000 The men who died were not taken away. Their bodies lay among us.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.000 So one of the other vessels that they're out with gets hit with a torpedo, American torpedo,
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:33.000 that's another vessel that's holding prisoners of war. It is the 1,317 were killed,
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:47.000 or sorry, 1,317 prisoners were on board. None of them were killed by the explosion,
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:55.000 but 1,159 of them drowned or died of exposure.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:03.000 And mind you, these were all guys that had served on the death railway.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000 Guys that had already suffered just unimaginable torture.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:25.000 And then as he suspected, it became their turn.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000 4 minutes later, we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and an explosion tore through the hold.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000 The whole structure shuddered and water flooded in it from above.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000 I knew then as the water crashed on top of me that my worst fears had been realized,
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000 we'd been hit and I knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000 It was in fact the first of two torpedoes that would send the hellship to the bottom within 15 minutes.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:00.000 The ship tilted, we were going down.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000 So the ship sinks. Now the Japanese had immediately tried to get off with lifeboats.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:14.000 It left all the prisoners trying to just create rafts with whatever they could.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000 Even after the sinking, the killing went on for those of us who survived and got on to rafts.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000 Anyone starting to panic was thrown off into the sea.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000 When they scrambled to get back, they were kicked away.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000 Men pushed under and held the Japanese up. Men pushed under and held under Japanese survivors.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000 Fighting broke out as the animal instinct to survive asserted itself,
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000 making some survivors try to capture more sea-werely vessels and shove others off to their deaths.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:48.000 Many gave up already so weak, dangerously dehydrated and ill.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:54.000 Many gulp the salt water and quickly went stark-raving mad, drowning themselves to end the torment.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Horrible as it may sound, as men became mad, they had to be shoved off of the rafts or boats,
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000 or the remainder might have perished.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000 There was a lot of shouting and screaming, cries of get off you bastard,
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000 or I'll kill you, made me close my eyes and distress.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000 Most of the shouts weren't in English.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:25.000 There were not many Japanese, the majority of whom had gotten off early in the life-fotes.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000 Drowning and dying men called for their wives, their children, or mothers,
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000 men said things like, Daddy will be home soon, and then disappeared beneath the waves.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000 It was harrowing to hear.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.000 By that stage, most of us were treading a very fine line between sanity and madness.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000 It didn't take much to put people over the top.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000 I couldn't see where it's coming from, but a group of men started singing.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000 First to keep their spirits up, they sang rule Britannia.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000 After the Celaranga incident, we had been banned from singing this stirring anthem,
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000 with its line about Britain's never-ever being slaves.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.000 So there you start seeing some spirit as they start singing, rule Britannia.
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000 Celaranga incident was when some prisoners had just just when the Japanese had taken over and sing a poor
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000 and they, I forget me if I don't remember this correctly.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.000 But a couple of guys had tried to escape and they got caught.
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000 And basically it was a standoff between the soldiers and the Japanese prisoners,
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000 our Japanese prison camp commanders.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:02.000 And the soldiers did not back down until they had executed for the four prisoners that had tried to escape.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000 And then they kept everyone out locked in this compound for five days.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000 And when the guy started to die from starvation and disinteriority and dehydration,
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000 and they said, okay, well, then they signed a paper that said no one else tried to escape.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.000 But they held the line as long as they possibly could.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.000 244 of my comrades on the Cachadoki Maru died that night. It was tragic beyond belief that having survived the death railway,
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000 they became prisoners of the deep.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:45.000 1,400 and three Allied servicemen had died as a result of the failure of the Japanese to observe the Geneva Convention
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000 and apply red crosses to our hellships.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000 He ends up getting recaptured by the Japanese.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 After the affords.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Yes. He does survive. He gets recaptured by the Japanese.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000 Eventually he's close to where Nagasaki is,
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000 but far enough away that he doesn't die from the blast of Nagasaki.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000 The war ends. They get picked up.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000 And eventually they're obviously brought home by Americans.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000 And eventually sent back to England.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000 He says that when he left Aberdeen, he'd weighed a healthy 135 pounds.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000 But here in Nagasaki on the steel yard scales,
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000 very accurate contraptions similar to those I had used at the Plumber's Merchants.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000 I was reduced to a skeletal 82 pounds.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000 I've got some pictures of these guys.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000 They literally look like skeletons.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:59.000 It's unbelievable that they were even able to survive.
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.000 New arrivals, men from the vast industrial Gulag,
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000 the Japanese had created in Fukunawa, flooded the quayside,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000 and the quayside.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000 They're basically cleaning these guys up now getting ready to put them on ships and ship them back to America.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000 Sadly, at this final hurdle, some did not make it.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000 And died on that quay.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000 This distressed the Americans immensely,
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000 and they were shocked by the matter of fact way
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000 that the other prisoners accepted the deaths of their mates.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000 We had seen so much too much.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:04.000 Now, I think quite possibly this is the heaviest book that we've talked to.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000 That we've talked about on the podcast.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 Yeah.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000 I'll do it with that.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000 And it's one of those things where
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:31.000 it's a question if people are even going to want to listen to this.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000 And I understand that.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000 I understand that some people did not make it through this reading.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000 And some people listen to it.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000 Some people are going to buy this book which they should.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:00.000 And some people are going to take this as a message.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:08.000 From somebody who has seen evil.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000 In a way that not too many people can claim to have seen.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.000 In a person that has had their every freedom taken from them.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:29.000 And their lives and their destiny put into the hands of sadistic people.
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:50.000 Now, if you did make it this far, I will let this end on and incredibly.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:06.000 Possitive, note and message from the author.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000 And he says this.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.000 My time as a prisoner of the Japanese helped shape and determine my path in life just as much as my childhood did.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.000 Like it or not, the horrors did happen to me and to thousands of others.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000 Yet some good has come out of it.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000 My ordeal has made me a much more patient, caring person.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:38.000 Inspired by the devotion of our hard-pressed medics on the death railway,
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000 I was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and for my late wife,
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000 I acquired 24-hour attention in the last stages of her life.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000 While in Japan and working with my friend, Dr. Matthewson,
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000 I vowed to spend the rest of my life helping others.
00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000 And I am so pleased to say that I have done so.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000 It is where my satisfaction comes from nowadays.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000 I have tried to use my experiences in a positive fashion and have adopted a model from them,
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000 which I never tire of telling others.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.000 There is no such word as can't.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000 I have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness.
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000 At 90 years of age, I have lived a long life and continue to live it to the fullest.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000 I enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and I have been fortunate to have a family
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000 and to enjoy their success.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000 I have amazed my doctors, my friends, my family and myself by remaining fit.
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:58.000 I am grateful for my present way of life after all the turmoil that life has thrown at me.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000 And thankful to have retained my sense of humor.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000 Most importantly, I now visit schools to tell pupils of what really happened in the Far East during those terrible war years.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000 In my 91st year, I am fortunate enough to spite the best efforts of the Japanese Imperial Army,
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000 to have the Vim and Viggar required to tell a new generation of how we suffered.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000 Scandalously, our sufferings, which have haunted all of us far east prisoners of war throughout our lives,
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000 were only recognized by the British government in the year 2000,
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000 when it offered compensation of 10,000 pounds to remaining survivors.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000 Unbelievably, the British taxpayer had to pay out that poultry sum,
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000 and not the culpable Japanese government.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000 I hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran Japan during the war years,
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000 and the failure of successive Japanese governments to face up to their crimes.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:11.000 But I hope too, then it will be inspirational and offer hope to those who suffer adversity in their daily lives,
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000 especially in these difficult times.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000 Life is worth living.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000 No matter what it throws at you is important to keep your eyes on the prize of that happiness will come.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:40.000 Even when the death railway reduced us to little more than animals, humanity and the shape of our saintly medical officers triumphed over barbarism.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:48.000 Remember, while it seems darkest before the dawn, perseverance pays off,
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000 and the good times will return.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000 May health and happiness be yours.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000 Alistair, Erkart.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:16.000 July 2009.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000 Life is worth living.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000 Yeah.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000 The book is the forgotten highlander.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000 It is a phenomenal read. It is a reality check.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000 It is incredibly moving.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000 And I highly recommend you buy it, you read it,
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000 and you understand what the world is.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000 You get a better understanding of what the world is about.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000 And I know I definitely got a better understanding of what the world is about in reading this.
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000 We're pretty much every detail.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000 Every little element that he went through made me think like dang I'd rather, I'd probably rather die in that situation.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000 Every little thing that happened.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000 Yeah, and there's obviously thousands of thousands and thousands of men that made that choice.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000 Yeah.
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000 And they're will got broken.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000 And they lost the will to live.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:37.000 So, it's incredible how strong the human will is that you can survive that at E2 pounds,
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000 this entry starvation, ulcers in your legs, put maggots on your legs.
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:52.000 I mean, it's just, it's truly incredible what the human can survive.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000 And it's also truly incredible what the human can complain about in this day and age.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000 Right? I mean, you can complain about just the most ridiculous things.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000 Yeah.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000 Just the most ridiculous things.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000 Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy how big that spectrum is.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000 Yeah. Just remind me to never complain about anything ever again.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000 You know what I mean?
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000 Don't let me complain about anything ever again.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000 I mean, I don't consider myself a big complainer, but come on.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000 This is just, we have no reason to complain about anything.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000 Yeah.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000 Yeah.
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000 And what's crazy, too, is one of the heavier parts there where I felt it was when he talked about the claustrophobia heart.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000 Yeah. I know you have an issue with it.
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Yeah.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000 It's there, but it's not, it's not, I'm not super sensitive to it, but it's something.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000 I know. I feel that that that's like a tough one to get over, you know?
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000 Yeah.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000 Dang, especially going through all that stuff first and then you got to deal with the cl-
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000 I don't know, man.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000 This might be too heavy for me.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000 Well, it was too heavy for a lot of people.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.000 And yeah, I mean, it's almost like, we almost don't need to have a discussion about this book.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000 You know, Meg, just stop talking about it.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000 You're gonna go read it.
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000 I get it, you know?
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000 And just let's move on, you know?
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000 Yeah.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:31.000 Because like I said, it just makes you realize just what kind of suffering there could be.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000 And how good you've got it.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000 How good you've got it.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000 I'm gonna go to bed tonight and my bed and that's gonna feel good.
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000 I'm gonna appreciate that.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000 I'm gonna appreciate it every night.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000 You know, yeah, so...
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000 Because you think about like some little things you don't even think about,
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000 but they're like a real luxury.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000 It's just things that you really enjoy.
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000 But you don't even think about it. They're just, they're just like, I want to have it.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000 Like for me, I really like a nice, cool, you know, big bottle of water.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000 You know, I have a big, just a big bottle of water.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000 I completely take it for granted.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000 When I go to work out the morning, I drop a couple ice cubes in there, fill it up.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000 It's all nice, filter and whatnot.
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000 No, I don't think anything about that.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000 That would be like heaven.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000 Heaven.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000 And then you get, you know, you go to bed at night.
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000 You just crawl into the, to the, the 500 thread.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000 Sheets or I don't know, there's some kind of sheets that are nice,
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000 but whatever they are, the kind of cotton sheets that are all nice.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000 Yeah.
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000 You climb into those. You don't think about that.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000 You're not thankful for that every night.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000 Yeah. Pretty much everything.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000 Pretty much everything. Pretty much everything.
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000 Even like, oh, you know how you're breathing right now?
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000 Yeah.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000 Consider that compared to that.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000 What you just read there.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000 Just what, just breathing. Let's just start with that.
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000 Let's just break it down with air.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The beginning.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000 I remember the cable guy was coming.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000 Mm-hmm.
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000 Which already sound silly. I know.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000 And he was late. He was supposed to come.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000 It's too was the cut off.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.000 Right.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000 Where he was going to cut.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000 He was like, you know, before the struggles real cable guy was late.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000 Yeah.
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000 So he can't, I don't know, to 15 or something.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000 And I had to go, I want to see go to work out or something.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000 This is getting worse and worse.
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000 I know this is going to be a good point.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000 Yeah.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000 For my team, it's like, you know, he's fixing that fixing.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000 For, you know, I'm not saying that.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000 I'm trying to tell you something about anything.
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000 Yeah.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000 And yeah.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000 And that's one of the things I thought of primarily when you said think of all the little luxury.
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000 So not only, not only am I complaining about something I don't need.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000 I'm complaining about something that I'm getting like a supreme luxury.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:05.000 I'm complaining about that, you know, because it didn't come 15 minutes of all things before the time that it did.
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000 Yeah.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000 I'm going to check myself.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000 To get idea.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000 I'm going to check myself too.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:24.000 So with that, let's go to some questions from the internet.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:35.000 And actually, to start this one off after the last podcast, number 11, when I had lay fund.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000 And we talked about Mark.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000 We talked about Mark Lee.
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000 We talked about Ryan Joe.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000 We talked about Chris Kyle.
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000 And, you know, we actually didn't talk about Mikey Montsour.
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.000 So I had a couple of people ask me, hey, why didn't you guys talk about Mikey Montsour?
01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:02.000 Well, the simple reason is it's kind of similar to the reason why I hadn't talked about Mark and Ryan and Chris yet either.
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000 Until like I lay fund.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000 Because lay fund was the Charlie Petune commander.
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000 Those guys weren't in Charlie Petune.
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:20.000 And, you know, I wanted to have him on as a, you know, as a, as a, as a,
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:27.000 I don't know what the word I'm looking for is, but I wanted to have guy from his platoon on or from there,
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000 platoon on to talk about him.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000 And I just, that's the way I felt.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000 And so that's what I stuck with with Mikey.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000 Mikey was in Delta, too.
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:46.000 And I can promise you, I will be talking about Mikey at some point on this.
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000 Mikey was just phenomenal and hero and a saint.
01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:03.000 And I will actually absolutely be covering his life.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000 And how he died and how we remembered him,
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000 that how we remember him still.
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000 But I really just want to get, you know, somebody from his platoon that was, you know,
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000 right with him, the whole time.
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000 And that's just, just the way I feel about it.
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000 So that's what I'm going to do.
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000 And yeah, that's what I'm going to do with Mikey.
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000 So it was Mikey.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000 Mikey will definitely, we know we'll have a show from Mikey.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000 Absolutely.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000 Mikey deserves a hell of a show.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000 And we'll have it from Mikey.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000 So be ready for that. I don't know whom to get.
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000 A lot of, a lot of guys from Delta, too.
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000 They're still on active duty.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000 The platoon commander still on active duty.
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000 The, all his good friends are still on active duty.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000 So it's going to be tough.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000 It's going to be tougher.
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000 It might take a little bit of time.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000 But that's the plan.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000 And it'll be worth it.
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000 So let's go to the next question.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000 Jockel, regarding mistakes.
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000 What are some of your own?
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000 And some you've seen made by leaders you looked up to.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000 And how to recover.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000 Can someone ever fully regain trust?
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000 This is actually pretty easy one because,
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000 um,
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000 look, if you make a mistake on it.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000 Uh, the worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000 trying to avoid taking blame for it.
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000 That's the worst thing you can do.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000 And if you think about the bosses that you've had,
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000 and you had some boss that made a mistake,
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000 and he's like, no, wasn't my fault.
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000 You just literally lose respect for him.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000 So you can't do that.
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000 You got to take, you got to take ownership of it.
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000 Um, because, again, if you think about the bosses that you've had,
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000 and the times that you had a boss that made excuses,
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000 you don't have any mercy on them.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000 You're just rude for us on them.
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000 You just pick them apart.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000 Hmm.
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000 So that step number one is, um,
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000 you know, take ownership if you make a mistake.
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000 And that's how it's always seemed to me from,
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000 as I looked up to Chain of Command.
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000 You know, if I saw a guy that made mistakes,
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000 and then he took ownership of them,
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000 like, okay, cool.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000 You know, he knows he made a mistake, cool.
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000 Well, we'll support him.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000 If they're doing the other thing,
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000 and they're blaming everybody else,
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000 they're not taking ownership.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000 You can have a hard time with it.
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000 And as a matter of fact,
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000 I actually had a mutiny in,
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000 in one of my potuence,
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000 where this is a long time ago,
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000 it's, you know,
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000 all the names are long since forgotten,
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000 but we had a,
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000 we had a mutiny in our potuence,
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000 where we said, you know,
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000 pretty much us,
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000 us lower and listed guys,
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000 we had a,
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000 we went to the,
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000 we literally went to the commanding officer,
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000 and said,
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000 we don't work with this guy.
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000 Yeah.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000 So, you know,
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000 all these ideas that people have of the,
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000 you know,
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000 military and of,
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000 you know,
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000 we obey orders and all this stuff.
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.000 I mean,
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000 think of what a little Jack asked I was.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000 We, you know,
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000 we said,
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000 well, you know what,
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000 we don't work with this guy.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000 We're going to go to the commanding officer,
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000 and tell him we don't want to work for this guy.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000 And the commanding officer,
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000 to his full credit.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000 He was like,
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000 listen, guys,
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000 you can't have a mutiny,
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000 not a my command,
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000 not a my team.
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000 You guys suck it up,
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000 you figured out a way to work it out.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000 Go do it,
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000 you're told,
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000 get in line.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000 So let me,
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000 you didn't work.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000 And then he fired the guy.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000 Yeah.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000 No,
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.000 he,
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000 he like basically made it perfectly clear like,
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000 this is your one chance.
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000 Hmm.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000 And he fired him.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000 But it was,
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000 it was,
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000 it was pretty crazy to see,
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000 to see it happen.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000 But,
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000 and I say,
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000 it's all the time.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000 It wasn't because the guy
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000 lacked tactical skill,
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000 it wasn't because he was physically fit.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000 Most of the reason was because he just couldn't,
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000 take anyone's,
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000 you know,
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000 advice,
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000 he wouldn't listen anybody.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000 And so when he was making a mistake,
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:06.000 it was,
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000 no,
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:07.000 no,
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000 we do it this way.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:08.000 No,
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000 it's okay.
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000 Constantly cover up for himself.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000 And obviously,
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000 it didn't work out for him.
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000 So your mutiny sort of just put him on,
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000 put him on notice.
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 That was his right up essentially.
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000 Yeah,
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000 but I think the commanding officer,
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000 I think was really just doing the right thing.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000 Saying,
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000 look, guys,
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000 you can't have a mutiny.
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000 Doesn't work that way.
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000 Get back in there,
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000 do what you're supposed to do.
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000 And then he was like,
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:33.000 okay,
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000 I've got to fire this guy.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000 Because it must not be good to have
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000 every,
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000 enlisted guy in the Poutoon come forward and say,
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000 I don't want to work with this guy.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000 Yeah.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000 That's not a good side.
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000 So the commanding officer did an outstanding job.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000 And he was actually a great,
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000 great,
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000 commanding officer too.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000 So it kind of worked on the deal.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000 It worked on the deal.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000 Yeah.
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000 And then I actually,
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000 the guy that took over was one of the best guys I ever worked for,
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000 if not the best.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000 Yeah,
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000 it was pretty awesome.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000 And then as far as regaining trust,
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000 which is the other part of the question.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000 This almost as soon as you admit that you made a mistake,
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000 you are automatically regaining trust.
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000 That's where you start regaining trust.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000 Yeah.
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000 And it just goes from there.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000 Then you follow through with what you say,
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.000 you know,
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000 you're constantly trying to build trust in relationships.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000 That's what you're trying to do.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000 And the minute you're lying to people,
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000 how are you building trust?
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000 Right.
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000 And if you make a mistake and you say,
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000 it's not your fault,
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000 then that's a lie and everyone knows it.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000 Yeah, that that fear is,
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000 especially not especially,
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000 but in regards to regaining trust,
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000 so to speak.
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000 You know, when someone admits mistakes,
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000 they have that fear that,
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000 oh, they're going to think I don't know what I'm doing.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000 Yeah.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000 Or I don't have a handle on this, you know?
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000 So doesn't matter.
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000 It's so doesn't matter.
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000 It's so much better to go,
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000 hey guys,
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000 I don't know how to do this.
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000 Can you show me how to do this?
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000 I'm not sure I've never done this before.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000 Right.
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.000 Or hey,
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000 I'm never used this kind of weapon before.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000 Can you give me an endoc on this thing?
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000 Right. Right.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000 The worst thing you can do is step up to the line
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000 with a weapon you've never used before.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000 Not know how to lock and loaded or clear and safe.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000 It looks like a total idiot.
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000 Because then you look like a guy that is too arrogant
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000 and too insecure to ask.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000 Yeah.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000 It's actually,
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000 it's actually a sign of insecurity.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000 If you can't ask when you need some help,
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000 it's something.
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000 Yeah, and it's funny how one people are in that position.
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000 And all kind of,
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000 just,
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000 this is kind of a general
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000 thing to know.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000 Is that you come off way more transparent than you think.
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000 You know how people will like,
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000 I don't know,
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000 something just as small as like name dropping.
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000 If you name drop someone,
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000 even,
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000 or you just mentioned this person name,
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000 but you're really name dropping even in a small way.
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000 People can smell that.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000 Yeah.
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000 So even like this stuff stuff that's a little bit more important
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000 where if a leader's insecure about something,
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000 it makes like you know everything,
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000 but he really does.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000 I hate when I do stuff like that.
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000 I know,
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000 but yeah.
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000 I hate when I do stuff like that.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000 Yeah.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000 Oh, God.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000 That's such a loser.
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000 And it's transparent.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000 Everyone knows it.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000 And a lot of people,
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000 brother,
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000 not in touch with that.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:04.000 They think that,
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000 oh yeah,
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000 they don't know because I'm just going to sort of mention it.
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000 And there's all these little things that it's just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 you just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.000 just,
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000 just, just, right you both put that broad mindset.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000 I think,
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:15.04 the way
01:18:15.04 --> 01:18:17.000 active you're you,
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.000 era,
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:17.000 and off,
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000 just you're in your campus.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:19.000 So the inside you go to.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Just,
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.000 that's some kind of somebody here.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000 So the inside you go to.
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000 You go to the theater,
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.000 and then you go to,
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000 the theater,
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000 you go to the floors,
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000 and you go to the third floor.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000 And you go to the theater,
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:29.000 and you go to,
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000 that before you set-to- pretentious.
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.000 You actually have a plate out here,
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000 but I kind of thought about what you say,
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:30.90 뒤-
01:18:30.90 --> 01:18:32.000 and you know,
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:19.000 drawn up and that your office is
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.50 understand for the least
01:18:34.50 --> 01:18:35.000 years.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:20.000 So I've got that short-ranking
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:36.000 ones here,
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.84 be transparent. Right. There's a big difference there. And totally true, but it is definitely
01:18:41.84 --> 01:18:48.04 better just to ask, say, hey, I don't know. That insecurity, that when you don't feel
01:18:48.04 --> 01:18:52.44 like asking something, that's a little knocking. You're no other say. So you're insecure.
01:18:52.44 --> 01:18:56.72 You're insecure. When you're, hey, you know what? I don't know how to do this. Can you
01:18:56.72 --> 01:19:00.68 be having this? I am stuck on this problem here. Can you give me help with this? Because
01:19:00.68 --> 01:19:05.20 I don't know how to do it. People don't say all of this, guys. Unless you're doing it every
01:19:05.20 --> 01:19:09.04 three sentences because that means you haven't studied. Yeah. Because you got to study.
01:19:09.04 --> 01:19:13.12 You got to know your trade. You got to know your craft. And if you don't, you got to
01:19:13.12 --> 01:19:17.36 learn it. You know, you got to break out the books and get on it. But once you broke
01:19:17.36 --> 01:19:19.92 out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you still don't understand,
01:19:19.92 --> 01:19:23.36 well, guess what? Just ask the question. Because your frontline troops are going to know more
01:19:23.36 --> 01:19:27.28 than you. They shouldn't know more than you. Yeah. You know, it's highly likely that you don't
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:31.20 know more than you. I mean, I was a radio man for eight years in the seal teams. By the time
01:19:31.20 --> 01:19:38.08 I was a lieutenant commander in a troop, I didn't know as much as those, you know, guys knew
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:41.92 about all the new radio stuff. So I just have to ask a question. There's no big deal. Yeah.
01:19:41.92 --> 01:19:47.52 If you're secure in your leadership, you're, you're fine to ask a couple questions. It's not
01:19:47.52 --> 01:19:54.80 that big of a deal. Yeah. But you are not clear to light a people. You're not clear to make excuses.
01:19:55.68 --> 01:20:00.96 And that's what, that's how you regain the trust is by telling people truth. It's really
01:20:00.96 --> 01:20:12.32 a simple concept. Yeah. Next question. In regards to working out, right, and training for, you
01:20:12.32 --> 01:20:20.000 know, selection. And by selection, you mean, mean special forces or ranger or seal selection.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.48 Yeah. That's what they're talking about here. Yeah. So, Jaco, what do you think of
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:32.56 rocking as fitness versus just train up? So for people that don't know what rocking is,
01:20:32.56 --> 01:20:38.56 rocking is putting a backpack on a rucksack with a bunch of weight in it and walking long
01:20:38.56 --> 01:20:42.72 distances. And to be honest with you, you really are jogging. You know, you're really going
01:20:42.72 --> 01:20:46.72 at a pretty good pace when you're doing it. And that's it. It's first rocking those. That's it.
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:53.04 Because because in a military, they can bring the pain with rock match, just forced road
01:20:53.04 --> 01:20:58.72 marches is what they're called. Yeah. You'll be rocking. You'll be rocking until you don't want
01:20:58.72 --> 01:21:07.68 to be rocking. And so, you know, you'll do 20 mile force road march, which is just, you're on the
01:21:07.68 --> 01:21:17.12 road with a 50 pound pack, just marching. Yeah. And so, the thing is, like anything else,
01:21:17.12 --> 01:21:25.04 if you want to get good at it, you got to do it. Right. So if you want to get good at people
01:21:25.04 --> 01:21:27.92 ask me, well, I need to get, we're going to get it. Pull ups. You know, how do you get good
01:21:27.92 --> 01:21:32.96 up? Pull ups. How do you get good up running? Run. How do you get that swimming? That's why
01:21:34.24 --> 01:21:37.20 oh, you want it out of good. Good. Good. Do you get to do you do you do you do you do you do
01:21:37.20 --> 01:21:41.76 you know, get on the mountain. Do you do you do you do you all bunch? Yeah. And if you want to
01:21:41.76 --> 01:21:47.68 get good at rocking, that hump and a rock, that carrying weight over long distances, rock.
01:21:47.68 --> 01:21:50.72 Because there's all kinds of little things that you got to get used to. Your feet got to get
01:21:50.72 --> 01:21:55.12 prepared. You're going to get weird muscles. Your back's got to get stronger. You're going to get,
01:21:55.12 --> 01:22:01.76 you know, calisers all over your feet. It takes a special type of fitness regiment to get used
01:22:01.76 --> 01:22:08.64 to and ready for long rock marches. And that special fitness regiment is rocking and lots of it.
01:22:08.64 --> 01:22:15.04 So, if you want to eventually, you can augment that, you know, you can start doing squats,
01:22:15.04 --> 01:22:21.44 you can start doing sperrins and that'll help you. You know, that's fine. But the foundation
01:22:21.44 --> 01:22:29.28 of the preparation for rock, humping should be rock, humping. And that's what's going to
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:36.96 make you good at it. So, did you do that? I did. I did. And rocking for me actually, oddly enough,
01:22:36.96 --> 01:22:43.60 is something that I was always good at. And it's weird because I wasn't the fastest springer
01:22:43.60 --> 01:22:47.20 and I wasn't the best long distance runner. Which, what does that make? Great.
01:22:47.20 --> 01:22:51.36 They choose a loser. Right. You can't win a spring and you can't win a long distance run. What's
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:56.16 wrong with you? Yeah, you're kind of in the middle. I was in the middle of the song. What I realized
01:22:56.16 --> 01:23:02.32 was that was good for carrying a rock sack. Yeah. And I got used to it too because I was a radioman.
01:23:02.32 --> 01:23:08.08 So, you always had to carry a freaking radio, you know, 30 pound radio with water or batteries.
01:23:08.08 --> 01:23:12.08 And you're just, it's always heavy. You're just sucking it up. And so, I got used to it.
01:23:12.08 --> 01:23:18.32 I suppose it was more than anything else. You're like, um, you're seeing the movie tremors?
01:23:18.32 --> 01:23:22.40 No. I'm thinking of the movie tremors. Right. Well, there's a time at the end there. Like, man,
01:23:22.40 --> 01:23:27.36 we need to, we need to go to those mountains for those, you know, to avoid underground worms.
01:23:27.36 --> 01:23:33.44 And they were like, hey, we could take the cat. And he's like, hey, it's slow, you know, the cat is a big,
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:39.20 you know, Bobcat, you know, the Bobcat is not sure. I know what underground worms are.
01:23:39.20 --> 01:23:43.44 That's something that's something completely different. But they're bad. So,
01:23:44.72 --> 01:23:49.28 they took the cat in the guy was like, no, we can't take the cat slower than hell. He's like,
01:23:49.28 --> 01:23:54.56 it doesn't, it can carry a ton of, you know, it was like you, you're like the cat.
01:23:54.56 --> 01:24:00.08 So they hooked up this big trailer, which is the rock in your chat. And, you know, and they drove
01:24:00.08 --> 01:24:04.40 everybody, um, you know, to the mountains. What would they plan to do to walk? No, they're
01:24:04.40 --> 01:24:09.28 trapped on on roofs on rooftop. And they're like, we're all going to starve up here. We got to
01:24:09.28 --> 01:24:13.44 make it to the mountains. It's like nine miles. Okay. They're like, how are we going to get there? We can't,
01:24:13.44 --> 01:24:17.68 you know, we can't run. They're going to get us. We can't, you know, so they'll say, we'll get the cat.
01:24:18.88 --> 01:24:24.000 God, they were like, oh, it's too slow. But they're like, yeah, but it can carry this big trailer.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.76 Yeah. You know, and I used to say that in the sealed teams that I, my opinion was it was better to be
01:24:29.76 --> 01:24:35.12 built like a four by four, and then like a Porsche. Yeah. It was better to be just because you got a
01:24:35.12 --> 01:24:39.36 carry way around. Right. Irreable. Yeah. What would you rather have working on a farm?
01:24:40.56 --> 01:24:49.20 Ford F 350 or a Porsche. Yeah. I mean, a Porsche is cool for the track. When everything's all lined
01:24:49.20 --> 01:24:53.28 up and down the way it's supposed to be, but you get any kind of terrain going on. You want that
01:24:53.28 --> 01:24:59.68 four before. And you want it bad. And so that's why, you know, the seals, the seals,
01:24:59.68 --> 01:25:07.76 guys that were kind of more a four by four than a Porsche. Yes, it would be better in the field,
01:25:07.76 --> 01:25:14.80 in the real seal situations. Yeah. You know, the actual, because the thing about that's, that's,
01:25:15.60 --> 01:25:19.20 it's a misconception about the seal teams is, you know, you see guys running on the beach.
01:25:19.20 --> 01:25:23.44 And you see guys swimming in the ocean and they never are carrying anything. Yeah. Yeah. That's just
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:28.64 complete lie. Because every time you do anything in the sealed teams, you're carrying a ton of weight
01:25:28.64 --> 01:25:34.000 with you. Yeah. And so you've got to be built like a four by four and not like a Porsche. Yeah.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.20 Yeah. Makes sense. So yeah. You weigh rather someone like you than some Sprinter who can run like a
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:44.000 four to 40, but then you put some, you know, something on the screen. The Sprinter is actually,
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.92 you know, what you, you just want somebody that's durable. Yeah. Durable is the word.
01:25:51.04 --> 01:25:57.20 Yeah. And if they're great athlete and they can have a awesome 40 time or they can run a marathon,
01:25:57.20 --> 01:26:02.48 but they're just durable. It's awesome. Yeah. Okay. I'm not trying to put four amateurs around the
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:08.32 guys. Sure. Because there's guys that was a guy when I was a team two and it was a guy I actually
01:26:08.32 --> 01:26:19.92 went through Buds with and he was he's kind of a short guy and he was kind of had a odd body shape.
01:26:21.12 --> 01:26:26.64 And so he kind of looked, he kind of had almost like a little pudgy belly and
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:34.08 he just was one of those guys and the funny thing is he could run faster than me and he could
01:26:34.08 --> 01:26:39.44 bench more than me. Yeah. No kidding. It goes awesome. I love that. Yeah. He's an awesome guy.
01:26:40.24 --> 01:26:45.36 Awesome guy. I said, you know, that's cool. People say that about him because he's a little bit
01:26:45.36 --> 01:26:49.84 short and a little bit pouty looking. I'm like, he can, he can actually bench more than me and he can
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:54.08 run faster than me. He can beat me in all the runs. So let's just be quiet. Yeah.
01:26:57.04 --> 01:27:02.48 Alright. Next question. Jockel, do you think that the military or me Navy Air Force is a
01:27:02.48 --> 01:27:09.12 young man's game? Because this guy is 29 years old and he's about to join up.
01:27:09.68 --> 01:27:12.32 He's about to get it on. Yeah. That's awesome.
01:27:15.92 --> 01:27:23.52 Two answers to that question. And as usual, with answers from me. The dichotomy. Unfortunately,
01:27:23.52 --> 01:27:29.12 there's a dichotomy and they oppose each other. First of all, yes. And anybody that says
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:36.48 it's not a young man's game is not telling the truth. Because it's a game where you're going to be on
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:42.08 travel, you're going to be gone, you're risking your lives at times. You're going to have to
01:27:44.48 --> 01:27:49.28 put up with a lack of comfort in your world. You're going to be living in barricade. I mean,
01:27:49.28 --> 01:27:54.96 it's just going to be, it's not, it's not creature comforts, right? It's the military. It's a semi-sparton
01:27:54.96 --> 01:28:00.80 environment. It's not the forgotten highlander for the love of God, but it's definitely more
01:28:00.80 --> 01:28:08.88 Spartan than what the average person has in regular life. So anybody to say it's not a young man's
01:28:08.88 --> 01:28:16.08 game is not telling the truth. Because it absolutely is. And for me, I joined when I was a kid when I was
01:28:16.08 --> 01:28:24.56 18 years old and it was awesome. I had no attachments in life. I went to the map station with nothing
01:28:24.56 --> 01:28:30.16 with that's the recruiting station where you actually go and I forget what it stands for, but
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:36.24 it's where you actually leave for the military. And I had nothing. Do you need to store anything?
01:28:36.24 --> 01:28:40.24 No. What's your, you know, where you need to send your mail? I don't get mail.
01:28:40.24 --> 01:28:46.16 Yeah. There's no mail that's sent to me. But blank slate. And that's awesome. You don't think about
01:28:46.16 --> 01:28:50.16 family. You don't think about anything. You just get in there and you get your job done. And if they say,
01:28:50.16 --> 01:28:53.52 hey, we're going to deploy you tomorrow for the next eight years, you say, cool. Let's do it.
01:28:53.52 --> 01:29:01.20 Yeah. Let's bring it. And and you have an old B to get nature because you don't know any better.
01:29:01.20 --> 01:29:06.16 You know, you joined the military and you're, you're stoked. You're getting a paycheck all of a sudden.
01:29:06.16 --> 01:29:14.24 You know, you got a three-hots and a cot. It's all good. You know, whereas when you're 17 years old
01:29:14.24 --> 01:29:19.28 and you're not quite putting things together yet, yeah, man. All of a sudden, like I said,
01:29:19.28 --> 01:29:22.32 you got a paycheck. You got three-hots and a cot. You're ready to rock and roll. They tell you
01:29:22.32 --> 01:29:29.28 which dude, you do it. That's good. So yeah, it's a young man's game. Now, that being said,
01:29:29.28 --> 01:29:36.64 of course, there's a dichotomy to that. And that is that the military is always in need of guys
01:29:36.64 --> 01:29:43.84 that are mature and smart and have experience in life, right? That you need to have people like that.
01:29:44.48 --> 01:29:48.80 Now, you get them eventually through the military. But it's also good to have people that won't
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:53.28 raise in the military environment so they can always have a little bit of an out review and you can
01:29:53.28 --> 01:30:00.16 learn a little bit from them. But what you have to get over, it's all those things that the young guy
01:30:00.16 --> 01:30:05.60 can eat for breakfast, right? You know, if you're 29 years old, there's a decent chance you've had
01:30:05.60 --> 01:30:12.32 a pretty nice apartment somewhere. There's a decent chance you slept in until, you know, 945 on the
01:30:12.32 --> 01:30:16.64 weekends. There's a decent chance that you stayed out until 2 o'clock in the morning and party and
01:30:16.64 --> 01:30:21.44 you know, brought a girl back and you slept in until 9 and you might be doing that on the regular.
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:26.48 You know what I mean? You got some clothes you're watching cable TV, you got all these things, right?
01:30:26.48 --> 01:30:30.64 And then the other part of that is you might have a family. You know, you might have a wife, you
01:30:30.64 --> 01:30:36.48 might have kids at 29 years old. Yeah. You might be established. You might have people relying on you
01:30:37.28 --> 01:30:42.80 not just financially, but emotion. Yeah, just to be there. So how you can cut all that away.
01:30:42.80 --> 01:30:48.32 That's the challenge for the older guy. Now, some older guys that are 29 years old, they don't have
01:30:48.32 --> 01:30:54.64 any of that yet. If so, best case scenario, you got both. Now, I'm not telling the 18 year old to hold
01:30:54.64 --> 01:31:00.80 off on an on and listing of the military. Don't hold off. Just get it done. Get it done. And you won't
01:31:00.80 --> 01:31:07.28 regret it unless you're, unless you screw up and bring it upon yourself. But if you are 29 and
01:31:07.28 --> 01:31:12.96 you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that are going to, the things that are going to
01:31:12.96 --> 01:31:17.20 things that are going to tear it you emotionally, right? They're going to tear it you emotionally.
01:31:17.20 --> 01:31:22.24 Now, what's cool is when you're in the military and you're raised in the military,
01:31:24.08 --> 01:31:35.28 you are raised in such a way that those those distractions are easily overcome.
01:31:35.28 --> 01:31:40.72 Right? You learn how to, you learn how to cut part mentalized those things. At least I did to say,
01:31:40.72 --> 01:31:45.12 you know what? Hey, I understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in on the weekend, but I'm not going to
01:31:45.12 --> 01:31:50.96 do it. Right? It's nice to be able to hang out with your wife and kids, but it doesn't matter to me
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:55.60 compared to my job. That's what you end up like, which is slightly psychopathic, but it's where you end up.
01:31:55.60 --> 01:32:00.32 Right? It's where it's where I end. It's where I end it up. It's where I end it up. Was, you know,
01:32:00.32 --> 01:32:06.72 nothing else matters besides the seal teams and I don't care about anything else. So, if you want to be
01:32:06.72 --> 01:32:10.88 in my life cool, you just got to do it around these giant parameters that's called the seal teams.
01:32:10.88 --> 01:32:19.12 Deal with it. Yeah. So, join up my brother 29 years old. Go and get after it. Do that. Be
01:32:19.12 --> 01:32:30.000 to you. Next question. Jocco, when do you cut your losses or give up on something and walk?
01:32:31.44 --> 01:32:41.60 When and how to decide to cut bait. Not a quitter. Too much brain damage.
01:32:43.12 --> 01:32:46.80 Brain damage. So, word I've been hearing more from the corporate world. Actually,
01:32:46.80 --> 01:32:51.20 these people talk about what's something's really hard to do and they're just causing brain damage by trying to do it.
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.56 And these were actually two questions. That's obviously a metaphor. Obviously. Yeah. Yeah. It's a metaphor.
01:32:56.56 --> 01:33:00.64 And it's a metaphor for what I talk about when I was like beating my head against the one that's
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:05.12 against you. And this is one of those things that confuses people because
01:33:06.56 --> 01:33:15.28 everyone here is including us in the seal teams. We hear the mantra of never, never quit, right? Never quit.
01:33:15.28 --> 01:33:22.08 And it's not just a mantra that we say. It's actually what we believe. Yeah.
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:30.32 And furthermore, it's not just what we say and it's not just what we believe.
01:33:31.84 --> 01:33:41.44 But it's literally how we act. Yeah. So, that that drive, that attitude of never quit,
01:33:41.44 --> 01:33:50.08 it's a powerful force. And it does push you over the edge to victory. To victory in many cases.
01:33:54.40 --> 01:34:01.44 But, and there's always a dichotomy to just about everything. There's a dichotomy to this too.
01:34:01.44 --> 01:34:10.08 Because over that attitude, you have to layer something on top of that. And that is
01:34:12.72 --> 01:34:20.80 it's basically strategic vision and understanding of the battlefield as a whole.
01:34:20.80 --> 01:34:31.28 So, you know, it's like the the saying of when the battle loses the war, this is the opposite, right?
01:34:31.28 --> 01:34:35.28 When the battle loses the war, meaning, oh, you stick to it right now and you might win right now,
01:34:35.28 --> 01:34:39.76 but in the long run, you're going to lose. This is the opposite. Where you, you're going to say,
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:43.44 you know what? I'm going to lose this battle right now. Yeah. But I'm going to win the war and the long run.
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:52.64 So, you absolutely need to know when you got to stop beating your head against the wall. You've got to know that.
01:34:53.52 --> 01:34:59.76 I personally draw my limit at 27 times after I beat my head against the wall 27 times. On the 28th time,
01:35:01.04 --> 01:35:05.52 I'm going to say, you know what? I bet there's another way to do this. Or maybe this isn't a battle worth fighting.
01:35:05.52 --> 01:35:15.52 Now, the main reason, I think why people get caught in the trap of banging their head against the wall
01:35:15.52 --> 01:35:21.52 or not knowing when to quit is because, and again, quit is a strong word and it's almost hard for me to say right now,
01:35:21.52 --> 01:35:27.20 because it's not knowing when to quit. I'm not talking about quitting. Yeah, I'm talking about,
01:35:27.20 --> 01:35:35.36 give up. Yeah, and I'm talking about making a strategic assessment of an unwinnable situation and deciding
01:35:35.84 --> 01:35:41.92 to disengage only so you can re-engage with superior firepower and crush the enemy.
01:35:42.80 --> 01:35:48.96 So, there's a big difference between that and quitting. Quitting means you curl up into a ball and wait to die.
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:53.60 That's where quitting is. And I don't support that under any circumstances.
01:35:53.60 --> 01:36:01.44 So, when do you, when does it happen where it happens because people get emotional?
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.52 They get too emotional about whatever obstacles in front of them, they get crazy about it.
01:36:07.52 --> 01:36:12.88 And they start seeing the obstacle as not only the battle, but also as the war.
01:36:14.72 --> 01:36:23.04 And they get lost in their own determination. I've seen this with some seal buddies in mind.
01:36:23.04 --> 01:36:30.48 They're so determined that they will not stop even when it's completely detrimental.
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.88 And they do it with just about everything. They'll be determined that anything.
01:36:36.88 --> 01:36:42.96 They'll be hurting themselves, training, they'll be determined to drink harder than anybody else.
01:36:42.96 --> 01:36:47.20 They'll, I mean, just anything you can throw out of them and they're determined to win at that.
01:36:47.20 --> 01:36:49.20 And they're actually losing. Yeah.
01:36:49.20 --> 01:36:54.40 So, so how do you prevent that from happening?
01:36:55.28 --> 01:37:01.20 Is you have to again, common theme here. You have to detach. You have to detach yourself. You have to
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:07.76 be able to step back away from the problem enough to look at it from a strategic viewpoint and say,
01:37:07.76 --> 01:37:12.24 okay, what's what's going on here? What's the risk? What's the reward?
01:37:12.24 --> 01:37:17.60 How much am I willing to sacrifice right now? And how is that sacrifice going to impact me tomorrow?
01:37:17.60 --> 01:37:25.68 Or the next day or next week? Yeah. And then, once you've detached and you've weighed and you've
01:37:25.68 --> 01:37:34.24 seen what the real value of this immediate objective is, then you can assess and make a logical decision.
01:37:35.04 --> 01:37:44.56 Based, not on your emotion, but on the actual impact of the situation in the overall strategic
01:37:44.56 --> 01:37:54.24 picture. Yeah. That I, you're saying when you weigh the detriments and the rewards.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.48 I think that that really makes it real clear when you can assess and be like, oh,
01:38:02.32 --> 01:38:06.16 all of this, we're getting all this, like all these detrimental stuff.
01:38:07.20 --> 01:38:12.32 When we're trying to get this, you know, this one benefit, you know, out of this person or out of this
01:38:12.32 --> 01:38:16.88 situation or whatever. And when you're, you're using up your resources or sacrificing more resources,
01:38:16.88 --> 01:38:21.92 then you are gaining ground. Then, you know, that that seems like a clear time to, that's a very
01:38:21.92 --> 01:38:26.80 least start thinking about disengaging. Yeah. And you got it. You got it detached to be able to
01:38:26.80 --> 01:38:30.96 set it. I noticed this in the digital all the time. People try to pass the passing guard as a successful
01:38:30.96 --> 01:38:36.24 example. Yeah. People just like do one guard pass and it doesn't work and they do it again and it
01:38:36.24 --> 01:38:40.000 doesn't work and they do it again. It doesn't work. They do it again. They go on and on and on until
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.08 their exhausted and gets wet. They get mounted and then they get put to tap.
01:38:46.32 --> 01:38:51.04 And it's because they were stubborn and they didn't detach and say, I mean, after you've tried to
01:38:51.04 --> 01:38:55.84 pass a guy's guard 14 times in a row the same way and it hasn't worked. Why is it going to work the
01:38:55.84 --> 01:39:02.96 15th time? The answer is it's not. Try something else. You know, I think I'm sorry.
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:07.12 Solid, solid answer. There is no solid answer. And it's the same thing you see this put in
01:39:07.12 --> 01:39:14.48 seals through training. They'd get like bogged down in a bad situation and they would they would
01:39:14.48 --> 01:39:19.52 just be start get focused on that one problem. You know, one room in a building they'd be like,
01:39:19.52 --> 01:39:23.76 no, send more guys into it. Send more guys into it. If you're just getting sprayed with paint,
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:29.12 ball and put down in the training operation and no, two more guys and eventually everyone's just
01:39:29.12 --> 01:39:32.48 you know, it's training but everyone's dead and they're like, I don't know what up and
01:39:32.48 --> 01:39:37.68 you just didn't they got focused on and it cost them. So the leaders got to be able to step back
01:39:37.68 --> 01:39:45.12 and patch and take a look at the situation and decide, you know what? I'm going to go ahead and
01:39:45.68 --> 01:39:50.96 change course right now. Not going to quit but I'm going to adjust make a strategic adjustment.
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:57.12 Yeah and that's it's weird how those semantics can really change your outlook on the whole
01:39:57.12 --> 01:40:05.04 task when you use the word quit versus disengage or another one with quit like I said is give up,
01:40:05.04 --> 01:40:08.48 you know, give it up. I mean unless it's something negative like smoking or something like that,
01:40:08.48 --> 01:40:12.16 you know quit smoking or get me to give up smoking. That's good but obviously smoking is negative
01:40:12.16 --> 01:40:18.72 but any kind of task or anything that requires effort. If you quit or quote unquote, give up,
01:40:18.72 --> 01:40:26.64 it's like it's hard to have that sound like a good thing, you know. Yeah and one thing that's
01:40:26.64 --> 01:40:33.36 this is you know obviously it applies to combat. It applies to jujitsu as we just talked about but also
01:40:33.36 --> 01:40:37.68 you know you look at what you're doing day to day and the little things in your life that you're trying
01:40:37.68 --> 01:40:42.48 to make work or in a business that you're trying to make something happen and sometimes people
01:40:42.48 --> 01:40:48.64 get so addicted to their plan. They get so their egos wrapped around their plan. Their plan is like
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:56.48 50% 50% tactics and technique and it's 50% their own ego and so when you try it when
01:40:56.48 --> 01:41:01.52 that person's plan starts to fail guess what they don't want to let it go because it's all wrapped
01:41:01.52 --> 01:41:07.44 up in the re-go so they just push it further, they push it further and especially if that person's
01:41:07.44 --> 01:41:11.76 in a senior position well then everyone's kind of just followed in line and they're looking at
01:41:11.76 --> 01:41:15.04 them. They all know they all know when they're at the bottom of the chain of command they're
01:41:15.04 --> 01:41:23.68 all looking at this person saying hey buddy it's not working. Yeah let's disengage and fall back
01:41:23.68 --> 01:41:28.48 and figure out a new plan of attack and then let's re-approach the target from a different angle let's
01:41:28.48 --> 01:41:37.92 flank this target. So if you're in a business, if you're in a relationship and you've got a situation
01:41:37.92 --> 01:41:43.36 where you're trying to make something work a certain way and it's not maybe it's got to
01:41:43.36 --> 01:41:48.48 disengage and you've got to come with a different angle of attack so that you can get the big wind
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:54.16 in the long run. Yeah and with relationships obviously it's it's it's the same dynamic but it's
01:41:54.16 --> 01:42:01.12 different because what's the same because when you're in a let's say boy from girlfriend relationship
01:42:01.12 --> 01:42:08.32 whatever even husband life you say it's not working. It's just one of them's abusive right meanwhile
01:42:08.32 --> 01:42:14.08 the other one's trying to quote unquote make it work and if they end up leaving all you gave up on him
01:42:14.08 --> 01:42:19.44 you know or you you quit I don't think you'd ever say you quit the relationship but you
01:42:19.44 --> 01:42:25.36 will just say you gave up on the relationship right you know well he's been abusing her for 10 years
01:42:25.36 --> 01:42:31.84 already you know or in your case 27 years or you know whatever the number is and you got to
01:42:32.88 --> 01:42:37.36 I do not abuse my wife all right but you know as far as your numbers go that's 27
01:42:37.36 --> 01:42:44.56 but again like if you say oh you gave up on the relationship it's kind of like it's the
01:42:44.56 --> 01:42:49.76 girls fault a little bit like maybe she's she shouldn't have done that almost you know but
01:42:51.36 --> 01:42:56.24 yeah you disengage and if you want to if you want to go for the win in that relationship
01:42:56.24 --> 01:42:59.68 and if you really want to maintain the relationship don't let it be husband wife relationship
01:42:59.68 --> 01:43:04.48 maybe go back to being neighbors or something like that even though an abusive relationship
01:43:04.48 --> 01:43:09.60 that might not work but I'm just seeing theoretically yeah I'm not sure about all that
01:43:11.60 --> 01:43:18.72 but I do know that if you find yourself trying repeatedly to make something happen
01:43:18.72 --> 01:43:24.56 and it's not happening try a different route don't consider yourself a quitter consider yourself
01:43:25.36 --> 01:43:34.40 a tax strategist or a tax issue next what
01:43:34.40 --> 01:43:49.68 question juggle in a fight MMA or otherwise would you substitute anger or rage for aggression
01:43:53.60 --> 01:43:59.84 would I substitute anger or rage for aggression this isn't a fight MMA or otherwise that's important
01:43:59.84 --> 01:44:06.64 actually yeah so we so just to clarify this means like instead of aggression is it okay to use
01:44:06.64 --> 01:44:15.44 anger or rage yeah okay well I think pretty obviously and people who expect the answer to be
01:44:15.44 --> 01:44:22.72 for me the initial answer here is no and I would not substitute anger or rage for aggressiveness
01:44:22.72 --> 01:44:31.76 I think obviously when you let rage take over you you're not thinking anymore yeah and the mind
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:38.72 is allegedly the most important weapon and I actually believe that to be true so if you
01:44:38.72 --> 01:44:43.28 let your rage and anger take over you're not using your mind and that's not good and you actually
01:44:43.28 --> 01:44:49.20 get to see this in MMA on a fairly regular basis because you'll get somebody that is really good
01:44:49.20 --> 01:44:54.08 at talking smack yeah and they'll get in the other person's head what does it mean to get
01:44:54.08 --> 01:44:59.92 the other person's head what does it do to him does it make them sad no does it make them not hate
01:44:59.92 --> 01:45:07.20 the opponent no what does it do to him it makes them angry yeah it makes them frustrated and that
01:45:07.20 --> 01:45:15.20 anger leads to frustration which leads to defeat so
01:45:15.20 --> 01:45:25.28 and again I think it's important to recognize that this doesn't just occur in MMA it occurs
01:45:25.28 --> 01:45:29.36 in everyday life and a good example is when you get to conversation with somebody you get to
01:45:29.36 --> 01:45:37.20 bake with somebody you get to an argument with somebody the minute you get frustrated or angry or
01:45:37.20 --> 01:45:45.84 enraged you just lost the argument you might you might feel like you won but you will not win the
01:45:45.84 --> 01:45:52.48 argument you lost the argument the minute that that happens yeah in any
01:45:53.52 --> 01:45:57.44 yes especially if it's an a debate man because you know it's an understood you're debating
01:45:57.44 --> 01:46:02.40 you're kind of against each other and then you just went off the rails basically right yeah it's not
01:46:02.40 --> 01:46:07.84 good to lose your temper in a debate in a conversation or in an MMA match it's like if you're playing
01:46:07.84 --> 01:46:13.28 chef we're playing chess and I was talking smack to you you got frustrated and the flipped over the
01:46:13.28 --> 01:46:20.56 chess board yeah you're with it with it you know a display of monumental power whatever whatever
01:46:20.56 --> 01:46:33.92 the rage actually rage yes yeah you you lost you know you absolutely this so I know I talk about
01:46:33.92 --> 01:46:39.84 this all the time is that the rule is you never let your emotion get in control so you don't let
01:46:39.84 --> 01:46:50.24 anger rage overwhelm your little brain now here's the here's the other side of that coin here's
01:46:50.24 --> 01:46:56.08 the dichotomy and I don't think you can even argue against this because it's that's pretty
01:46:56.08 --> 01:47:00.08 sound argument right I mean what we just said I mean we've seen it we know we know for a fact
01:47:02.40 --> 01:47:10.88 but rules are made to be broken um there are times win emotion can increase performance
01:47:10.88 --> 01:47:18.56 right they're absolutely are and I remember when I was a kid growing up the the Soviet Union was
01:47:18.56 --> 01:47:26.24 still just hardcore communist and when I would watch like the Olympics they would be like
01:47:26.24 --> 01:47:32.16 machines the Soviets no emotions and I thought bad ones guys are bad ass I wanted to be like that
01:47:33.84 --> 01:47:38.88 and an often brought in victories but I heard a quote when I was a kid and I actually looked for
01:47:38.88 --> 01:47:42.64 it because I wanted to bring it up I couldn't find it but it was something along the lines of this
01:47:42.64 --> 01:47:50.000 and that was that Soviet the Soviet athletes perform better in practice but the Americans perform better in
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.44 the stadium so the Americans and that's not a universal statement and there's plenty of examples
01:47:57.44 --> 01:48:04.16 of the Russians beat Americans in whatever but there's also examples of where the Americans
01:48:04.16 --> 01:48:12.32 with their emotion and their fire were able to beat these Russians and I mean the greatest
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:17.68 example would be the miracle life on ice and in late class of New York in 1980 which is you know
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:24.08 that was a bunch of college kids that were fired up to beat the hardened Russian professional hockey team
01:48:26.08 --> 01:48:30.72 and and it's because you know they kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a great
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:34.88 time to have your emotions trained out of it you know there's a great time where you like you know what
01:48:34.88 --> 01:48:41.36 I'm not gonna let my emotions play into this I heard a heard something about tiger woods
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:49.20 and his golf game and he's not thinking about you know the the broad statement is when he's hitting
01:48:49.20 --> 01:48:55.20 a shot and golf he's not thinking about the last shot and he's not thinking about the next shot
01:48:55.20 --> 01:48:59.12 he's just thinking about that shot right there so there's no emotional of whether he's
01:48:59.12 --> 01:49:04.16 I had or behind or nothing else it just he just is there on that one shot so
01:49:06.56 --> 01:49:13.44 I think that you know we I think that people I mean Americans is the example I used but I think
01:49:13.44 --> 01:49:22.000 that people in general can use your emotion to to your advantage sometimes but
01:49:23.68 --> 01:49:28.88 it does take control and it takes direction and also I think it's important to remember that
01:49:28.88 --> 01:49:38.64 it doesn't take long for that extra fire of anger to go from making you stronger and faster to
01:49:38.64 --> 01:49:45.76 making you slower and weaker both mentally and physically so you can get that burst and you know
01:49:45.76 --> 01:49:48.96 you see this in fighting all the time where people punch themselves out you know they go
01:49:48.96 --> 01:49:53.84 up and they go level seven rage and they start swinging for the first excitement even yeah
01:49:53.84 --> 01:49:57.44 or excitement they think the guy they think they got the guy in the in the heart locker they come
01:49:57.44 --> 01:50:04.16 they bring the thunder for they get they get emotional you know and I think on the mat
01:50:05.20 --> 01:50:09.60 when you get a guy that loses his temper when when somebody loses their temper with me on the
01:50:09.60 --> 01:50:15.60 mat it's just a matter of time like I just go okay cool he's got you know he's got three minutes left
01:50:15.60 --> 01:50:25.28 because he's gonna be done so yeah you've got to stay calm now a couple situations that I've seen
01:50:25.28 --> 01:50:32.80 or been a participant in and I'm pretty sure I was trying to remember this for sure but I was
01:50:32.80 --> 01:50:39.84 cornering Jeremy Stevens and if you don't know Jeremy Stevens is little Heathen MMA, awesome guy,
01:50:39.84 --> 01:50:46.32 stud fighter and we were training him at the time and he was fighting I'm pretty sure it was
01:50:46.32 --> 01:50:55.12 against Marcus Davis who's a well-respected boxer really good MMA fighter as well but definitely
01:50:55.12 --> 01:50:59.52 known for his boxing well Jeremy's known for his striking as well he's a very powerful striker
01:51:00.32 --> 01:51:08.96 and he's got unbelievable one punch knockout power Jeremy does so I was cornering Jeremy
01:51:09.52 --> 01:51:16.08 and it was a really really close fight I mean it was a I didn't know if he was winner losing
01:51:16.08 --> 01:51:22.80 I think it was leading towards Marcus actually and there's three rounds in MMA in this
01:51:22.80 --> 01:51:32.40 fight and in between the second and the third round I got in the ring got in the cage with Jeremy
01:51:32.40 --> 01:51:39.92 and I did the full on you know in his face and I you know I gave him the hey listen this is
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:45.36 what's going on this guy crossering from you is taking money off your kids table it's taking food
01:51:45.36 --> 01:51:49.20 off your kids table he's gonna take you the roof off their heads he's taking everything that you
01:51:49.20 --> 01:51:52.56 work for he's gonna take it from you right now you gotta get past you gotta go when you're
01:51:52.56 --> 01:51:56.40 you gotta destroy him and I got you know I've got to get my fired up speech like that and you
01:51:56.40 --> 01:52:03.04 could see it switching his eyes he realized like he went into a rage of I need to kill this guy
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:09.36 yeah and he came out that round and knocked him out yeah and that's a one I'll tell you another one
01:52:09.36 --> 01:52:20.08 I saw that was it was the same so it was it was Carlos Condit versus Rory McDonald and this was
01:52:21.92 --> 01:52:27.36 this was the first time they fought I'm pretty sure it was in Canada I was there I forget who I was
01:52:27.36 --> 01:52:33.60 cornering but I was there and I was done with cornering whoever I was cornering and
01:52:33.60 --> 01:52:38.64 I want to say it was Peter Symbodah I was cornering I think it was up in Canada but
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:49.52 so Carlos Condit versus Rory McDonald and Carlos who's the veteran is going up the kids the
01:52:49.52 --> 01:52:54.48 kid you know Rory McDonald was in kind of an A was an unknown but he was definitely the younger I
01:52:54.48 --> 01:53:00.88 think he was 20 years old you know just a kid no offense Rory but he was young you know what I mean
01:53:00.88 --> 01:53:06.64 badass but young and Carlos was the vet you know he was a veteran grown man with a wife of kids
01:53:07.68 --> 01:53:12.64 and man Rory was getting the better moves in front of Rory's hometown well I don't know
01:53:12.64 --> 01:53:18.16 his hometown but it was a Canada and so the crowd was absolutely supporting Rory at least I'm
01:53:18.16 --> 01:53:23.20 pretty sure I remember this right I'm sorry if I don't but it seemed like the crowd was on the
01:53:23.20 --> 01:53:31.92 side of Rory McDonald so in between so I'm just watching the fight but I just snake some really
01:53:31.92 --> 01:53:37.04 good seats so I had a really good view by the way when I go to UFC thanks day to white and the rest
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:41.44 of the crew like I sneak into some awesome seats after I get done cornering people so thank you
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:45.76 so I was sitting you know in the second row or something phenomenal seat that I'd snuck into
01:53:46.72 --> 01:53:51.04 and because they throw you in the cheap seats when you're when you're cornering people you come out
01:53:51.04 --> 01:53:56.000 to watch the fights and yeah you're up in the nose bleeds which isn't cool so I just get aggressive
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.56 and tact we move to better positions which is usually the second row right behind the press box
01:54:00.56 --> 01:54:08.48 so I'm sitting down there and I'm watching the fight and Greg Jackson is cornering Carlos
01:54:08.48 --> 01:54:14.16 content now if you don't know anything about Greg Jackson he's he's pretty zen like a guy and
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:22.40 I'm actually going back in the day going way back in the day when Dean and I were competing all the
01:54:22.40 --> 01:54:30.000 time in the kind of the so-called scene of grappling we would we do every competition there was
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.64 we're competing all the time grappling I don't even remember there were so many of them that we do
01:54:36.32 --> 01:54:43.68 and Greg Jackson would bring guys out to to fight to compete and so like we wrestled against
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:47.60 these guys you know or we did some fishing grappling and these guys so I kind of knew him from that
01:54:47.60 --> 01:54:54.32 and then surprisingly one time when the UFC was in San Diego I was at work at the seal teams and
01:54:54.32 --> 01:54:59.20 someone called and said hey there's a there's a guy from the UFC here do you want to give them a tour
01:54:59.20 --> 01:55:04.24 of you know he wants a tour the UFC set up a tour of the seal teams they want to show them around
01:55:04.80 --> 01:55:10.24 like the facility there is facilities you know the whatever some guns you know just the gear
01:55:10.24 --> 01:55:15.12 whatever so I show up and it's Greg Jackson and you know we kind of had a little bit of a recognition
01:55:15.76 --> 01:55:21.92 but anyways Greg Jackson and you know you kind of hear this stuff about Greg Jackson all the time
01:55:21.92 --> 01:55:27.52 that he's this really nice guy and that he's super mellow and that he's really humble well it's all
01:55:27.52 --> 01:55:34.24 freaking true okay he's a super nice guy he's super humble he's just a fantastic guy and uh I
01:55:34.24 --> 01:55:38.56 gave him a tour and so we kind of got to know each other and then you know going fast forward now
01:55:38.56 --> 01:55:43.76 in the UFC I I've cornered him several times I don't know how many times I've cornered against him
01:55:43.76 --> 01:55:49.76 you know against him like my fighters are fighting his fighters yeah and you know like I said he's a
01:55:49.76 --> 01:55:54.64 really like a really mellow and a zen like guy if you watch him in the corners of his fights he's always
01:55:54.64 --> 01:55:59.60 like that just very steady and hey this is what you need to do you need to watch out for this or whatever
01:55:59.60 --> 01:56:07.84 hmm so I'm watching this fight and like I said Carlos Condit versus Rurric Donald Carlos is not
01:56:07.84 --> 01:56:17.52 winning right he's not winning and in between uh the second and the third ground Greg Jackson
01:56:17.52 --> 01:56:23.36 goes full berserker mode on Condit I mean he is yellow and Adam he is in his face he's
01:56:23.36 --> 01:56:29.92 pointing out on his wave and his finger he's just going nuts on him and I was like damn Greg Jackson
01:56:29.92 --> 01:56:38.48 is bringing the heat and sure enough he empt up Carlos Condit Carlos Condit came out and finished
01:56:38.48 --> 01:56:45.92 Rurric in the third which of a fight he was definitely gonna lose so what you see there is emotion
01:56:45.92 --> 01:56:55.20 helping to win in that situation yeah and actually before when the fight was over I saw Greg
01:56:55.20 --> 01:57:01.60 and I just kind of said something to him you know like hey you went full berserker mode on
01:57:01.60 --> 01:57:07.68 Carlos and he said yeah he said like I had to do it it's funny it's you could see it almost seemed
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:11.36 like he'd never done it before I don't know maybe one I have to have Greg on at some point he can tell
01:57:11.36 --> 01:57:18.08 the story but he said something along lines of you know I had to do it and it worked so he
01:57:18.08 --> 01:57:24.56 did it a big smile and that was working it and it definitely indeed it did work yeah and those
01:57:25.28 --> 01:57:32.56 would you do you think I mean total gas but do you think that's because those just happen to be
01:57:32.56 --> 01:57:40.40 the exceptions or is it because really the formula kind of seems like here's the emotion and then
01:57:40.40 --> 01:57:46.24 here's all the logic and the skill and the planning implementation of you know game plans and all
01:57:46.24 --> 01:57:51.84 the all the stuff that you're gonna use in your mind and here's the emotion it's like it's like
01:57:51.84 --> 01:57:58.72 it's like a little spark plug or something and and um sure the emotion can go up but the skill
01:57:58.72 --> 01:58:04.48 got to go up proportionately and once you start to do this when the emotion takes over that's one
01:58:04.48 --> 01:58:09.76 you know when you're gonna fail or you think advantage so I think there's a sweet spot in there
01:58:10.72 --> 01:58:19.04 where for moments in time emotion and even borderlining on rage which I think range is a
01:58:19.04 --> 01:58:24.48 little bit strong because I think rage you lose your clarity but anger which is you can still have
01:58:24.48 --> 01:58:31.76 some clarity of what you're doing right so if I think you can actually that can be utilized appropriately
01:58:31.76 --> 01:58:36.80 at the right times and I think these times you know like I talked about Jeremy you know I had to
01:58:36.80 --> 01:58:42.08 provoke some anger out of him you know I had to provoke and it absolutely helped him he's gonna lose
01:58:42.08 --> 01:58:48.000 that fight and it's the same thing with Carlos Carlos was absolutely gonna lose that fight if he didn't
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.72 do something different if he didn't you know it's like it's like hit in the turbo button it's like
01:58:52.72 --> 01:58:56.32 hitting uh when I hit your socks I right it's not gonna it's like hitting the blood the
01:58:56.32 --> 01:59:02.48 nitrous oxide blower it's only gonna get you it's only gonna make you go hard for another yeah
01:59:02.48 --> 01:59:08.40 what is another two minutes or well without nitrous oxide it's not very long at all but yeah but with
01:59:08.40 --> 01:59:16.64 but with anger you know it can make you go for another you know whatever maybe it's maybe it's two minutes
01:59:16.64 --> 01:59:21.60 and this is something else have you ever missed like a heavy single like like okay you're lifting
01:59:21.60 --> 01:59:25.28 your deadlift thing or you're doing power cleanser something and you miss a heavy signal
01:59:25.28 --> 01:59:33.68 I know I never have heard so so this is another easy way to prove it man I miss a heavy
01:59:33.68 --> 01:59:40.24 signal sometimes and sometimes I just get angry yeah it's true and I just have to bring the anger
01:59:40.24 --> 01:59:45.36 yeah and I start getting fired up and I start thinking about things that make me angry yeah
01:59:45.36 --> 01:59:51.20 and I get over that barn I rip that thing off the floor like I hate it yes and it absolutely
01:59:51.20 --> 01:59:54.96 makes me stronger that moment so is that a dress probably adrenaline and it's probably the same
01:59:54.96 --> 01:59:59.60 thing that pumped into marcuses or into Jeremy's head it's probably the same thing that part
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:05.52 pumped into Carlos's head but it's crazy because despite getting punched despite getting beaten
02:00:05.52 --> 02:00:10.80 despite having someone you know trying to destroy you in front of a large crowd of people none of
02:00:10.80 --> 02:00:15.68 that was able to spark the it was able to spark the adrenaline as much as some kind of a
02:00:16.48 --> 02:00:23.20 tap into the emotional portion of your mind to bring out just enough rage to get out there and get
02:00:23.20 --> 02:00:28.40 that job done once and for all yeah and yeah and that's really the key they're just enough rage
02:00:28.40 --> 02:00:33.84 especially when you're talking about something that requires technique when you say lifting your
02:00:33.84 --> 02:00:40.88 you're like powerfully for example and I remember it was in in college and I was going for my
02:00:40.88 --> 02:00:46.32 one right max and yeah you fail a couple times but for the sake of saving time and stuff you
02:00:46.32 --> 02:00:50.32 can only give you three times won't in my case they were like you have to get it three times
02:00:50.32 --> 02:00:56.000 so the first time I'd gotten all of them I was pretty solid at parkling to that type
02:00:57.28 --> 02:01:03.84 so I was getting all of them and then I got to that point and I didn't get it it was 300
02:01:03.84 --> 02:01:10.40 300 I weighed 185 at the time 298 are you looking for props right there yeah okay drop
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:14.48 you drop props to everybody drop stack but when you was talking earlier about when you
02:01:14.48 --> 02:01:20.32 named drop and stuff yeah that's what it sounds like no I did that don't perfectly try to do it
02:01:20.32 --> 02:01:25.04 if I were to go out of my way to leave out that number true you know you wanted to know you
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:28.80 wanted to know how much I was doing I knew you were going to say it didn't matter for now you wanted
02:01:28.80 --> 02:01:36.96 to help anyway doesn't matter nonetheless the first time I failed and I was like no you got this
02:01:36.96 --> 02:01:42.32 you got this and I had this getting run wood this name it's a broad blonde hair like it's
02:01:42.32 --> 02:01:46.32 used like is this tough guy could hit real hard and you you would always get nuts and you
02:01:46.32 --> 02:01:52.32 like you got to shoot in you know you're this and then you know making me mad or whatever and
02:01:52.32 --> 02:01:56.72 I didn't outwardly express any kind of anger but I felt that anger and power playing takes
02:01:56.72 --> 02:02:01.12 technique that's the thing it's not like it's just you know like I don't know like a
02:02:01.12 --> 02:02:06.40 even bench has some technique but that left is I mean everything has technique but
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:14.96 power clean takes a little bit more technique than other left yeah so it was just the
02:02:14.96 --> 02:02:18.80 perfect amount of rage you know and that's going to depend on what kind of person you are like
02:02:18.80 --> 02:02:23.60 Jeremy Stevens you could tell just even the way he trains he uses some rage in there and you know
02:02:23.60 --> 02:02:27.60 as opposed to roaring me down for example seemingly I don't know I don't want you to
02:02:27.60 --> 02:02:32.80 train on time or nothing but it seems like he's super methodical you know in rage or anger whatever
02:02:32.80 --> 02:02:38.72 is it he is as much of a part as someone like Jeremy Stevens with uh
02:02:41.28 --> 02:02:48.40 probably love yeah oh my god crazy braw yeah what I'm gonna do yeah and yeah
02:02:48.40 --> 02:02:54.72 Mary's not spending the way they train up there at try stories I spent like the week
02:02:54.72 --> 02:03:00.88 and I was like half a week or whatever with them with for us and um and Rory and it's heat
02:03:00.88 --> 02:03:05.92 for us as this head you know how guys hold mitts I'm sure they hold mitts and stuff but he has
02:03:05.92 --> 02:03:12.96 this head that you hit the head instead of the mitt I'll say cool it seems like oh that's not that
02:03:12.96 --> 02:03:17.20 like it seems kind of obvious so I never seen no one do that and it made way more sense because I
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:22.16 have hit mitts before and then when you go to sparse like it's kind of weird you gotta get used to
02:03:22.16 --> 02:03:27.44 the difference between hitting mitts and hitting someone's head so I thought man that's clever man
02:03:27.44 --> 02:03:32.48 he's guys it's getting some smart up here and yeah yeah I respect to those I mean I respect all the
02:03:32.48 --> 02:03:38.32 guys to get in the get in the UFC and fight man it's awesome to watch and that that
02:03:38.32 --> 02:03:45.52 lawler uh McDonald fight was just uh was just insane yeah it was insane yeah you know watch that
02:03:45.52 --> 02:03:48.64 fight if you have anyone that hasn't watched that fight go watch that fight you've seen a couple
02:03:48.64 --> 02:03:53.76 warriors just bring in the bringing it all and leaving it all right there and again you go watch that
02:03:53.76 --> 02:04:00.32 fight so did you get the power cream I got the power cream yes yes and then here's the thing
02:04:00.32 --> 02:04:06.40 about that power cream so you yeah I got it right and so you go up and you're like all right you
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:12.40 got to you go up and wait the next one was like 303 like super small wait because you want to get
02:04:12.40 --> 02:04:18.24 yeah yeah yeah just so you can get the 303 not even close everything was spent on that we didn't
02:04:18.24 --> 02:04:24.24 miss that one didn't we yeah we did it was at the all-time life life not I just disengage that's all
02:04:24.24 --> 02:04:32.64 that we're just disengage I see where it's at we can be good with that all right I feel like we should
02:04:32.64 --> 02:04:38.40 go into the next question we got time for about one more what do you think I think so yeah okay
02:04:38.40 --> 02:04:47.44 juggle is the ability to switch on and off a personal feature or is it a trained skill
02:04:50.32 --> 02:05:01.12 is this confused with the term beast mode what causes that switched to flip the overdrive
02:05:01.12 --> 02:05:14.24 the beast mode the full on destroyer that will not stop I think it's actually this is it is
02:05:14.24 --> 02:05:19.68 something that's learned I think and I think it's a hard lesson I don't think everyone gets it
02:05:19.68 --> 02:05:25.04 and I think some people go through life without ever getting it and I'll tell you it's
02:05:25.04 --> 02:05:33.76 it's an important lesson it's a critical lesson it's a thing that allows you to go the extra
02:05:33.76 --> 02:05:44.88 distance to dig just a little bit deeper and push a little harder to get after it and
02:05:47.28 --> 02:05:52.56 like many other things in life there's a dichotomy because it actually takes in my opinion
02:05:52.56 --> 02:06:05.92 to opposing forces to bring it to life it takes both emotion and logic for you to reach your
02:06:05.92 --> 02:06:16.16 maximum potential to really give everything you have and go beyond your limits because both
02:06:16.16 --> 02:06:26.48 emotion and logic they're going to reach their limitations and in one fails you rely on the
02:06:26.48 --> 02:06:37.52 other one so when it doesn't make sense logical sense to go on that's when you got to use your
02:06:37.52 --> 02:06:44.000 emotion that's when you got to use that anger and frustration that fear to push yourself
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:56.40 harder to push yourself to say I don't stop and when your feelings are screaming that you've
02:06:56.40 --> 02:07:02.08 had enough and when you think you're going to break emotionally you got to override that emotion
02:07:02.08 --> 02:07:17.20 with the concrete logic and will power that says you know what I don't stop so you fight the
02:07:17.20 --> 02:07:25.76 weak emotions with the power of logic and you fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotions
02:07:25.76 --> 02:07:38.80 and in the balance of those two that's where you find the strength and the tenacity and the
02:07:38.80 --> 02:08:03.60 guts to say yourself I don't stop and you won't and I think that's about it for tonight
