so how does this apply to everyday life and business train how you fight train how you fight know the status of men and equipment check up on those that are absentee from training practice maintenance in the field practice and he's got little sections about these each one of these practice sound troop leading procedures the subject of troop leading procedures and allied techniques requires increased emphasis on tactical exercises fundamentals found in field manuals and related publications are worthy of stress sound command procedures diligently practiced in all field training will form good habits in the unit commander form the checklist habit meticulous planning and reconnaissance are required to make sure that every minute in the field will be expanded profitably check this for this purpose are necessary command and staff tool just as they are for supervising and testing the conduct of training what do you got I got the same thing I keep thinking about every time I hear what he has to say he he keeps repeating fundamental sound realistic fundamentals these are the fundamental to the basic things all the basic things associated with their job and being good at those things and training in a real asexinereo there's a lot obviously general carcass talking about war he's recounting his experiences war I hear what he's saying is connecting it to war but the the application of these things as I keep hearing it in my head hearing what you're saying and thinking about the things I'm thinking about now if you are in the private sector anywhere the private sector unless you happen to be in one of the rare sectors that's not competitive and there are almost none if you are in the if you are in the American capitalist private sector you are at war your competitors don't want to share space with you they don't want to cooperate with you to to work in harmony to they want to run you over they want to take all of your clients all of your market share and all of your product they want to take all that from you and the way you are successful is the exact same things your people have to be trained on the fundamentals and everything that applies to them and the only way to do that is to find a way to train them realistically that replicates what they're going to deal with in the real war in their real world it's just kind of crazy how while it seems difficult to make the connection to his world the connection is so straightforward to any world that you're operating in you're exponentially more prepared for that situation and and we know when you're in a leadership position you're going to roll into a meeting where you've got to deliver some bad news to the troops you know what they're going to say you know there's eight responses you're going to get why not think through those things why not think through those things you're going to talk to a client that you've disappointed you've let down you've made a mistake you know they're going to have one of six different reactions why not work through those why not have a contingency plan for each one of those six things this will take you four minutes to do it'll take you and I four minutes to roll play may it'll take us five ten minutes to roll play the six different responses when I roll into you yes he breaks down here organization for unit training training plans comprehensible and workable plans are indispensable and should be formulated with consideration of the falling for essentials established training goals that's number one number two continuous evaluation this process must go on throughout the training cycle and as an integral part of it only by continuous evaluation can deficiencies be discovered early enough to make immediate correction possible number three testing closely related to evaluation is the more formal testing that is given to an individual or unit at the conclusion of a phase of training or block of instruction it's here that we determine whether our training goals have been met number four remedial training I must emphasize here the value of remedial or makeup training once event once a valuation in testing have identified the areas of deficiency remedial training must be used to correct them it should be an integral part of every training schedule of course the instruction will be designed to overcome specific weaknesses that have been exposed by the testing program and will have to be keyed to the specific needs of your unit it is essential however that remedial training be regularly scheduled gosh that makes sense so those are the four things established training goals continuous evaluation testing and remedial training what would that was their tests whether tests at each phase of top gun as you are going through the training Dave here's what we're going to do you're going to go in this building I'm going to go in this building you're going to take your squad you're going to move to here you're going to move to there does everyone understand all right we're going to go do it right now in this training exercise with no rehearsals that will show us the short falls of our planning and our communication it will also show the team short falls and when they don't know what to do they should raise their hand and say hey boss that doesn't make sense to me right now hold on a second let me hear that again I don't understand that part practice more than one thing at a time because I you don't really think about that when you're at work you know where you kind of want to be the best worker in company sure you know but the customer like experience is kind of the whole deal you know you know how like man when you leave your review you're like great product bad customer service and that can be like well that sucks because I need some customer service kind of thing I wasn't that position is if you're in a particular geography particular place and talking to a particular other person some radios going to work better than other radios this is true you might need to know hey you know what we're like in the bushes here in the in the wilderness so in the jungle this radio doesn't work here doesn't penetrate through this this thing so there's a million different examples of that if you get that out of order and you just work you you learn how to maneuver the system like my my my cursor moves at the here I move my my cursor on the display here and you don't actually know what's happening to the mechanics behind that you're going to start making mistakes inside in specific settings but I'm saying like you know you have these elements of a product or service that are all to the customer it's like it's all the same thing I'm not going to go to this person just for one thing I'm going to go I mean as far as one quality of their product they're going to they'll get turned off by other departments so if you work there for your just focus on yours rather that affects you that's what general car is saying you have to interact with other people inside your organization and if you're not doing that you're wrong you're wrong fast forward a little training philosophy the basic the basic philosophy of successful training is that of obtaining superior results with average personnel I didn't make it up neither do the hack there you go I believe the source is general clerk sweatless solution that's like that's that stuck with me for a long time still is with me really because sweat in part of it is yes because I had to admit to myself brother to me a lot of the time I'm looking for that sweatless this faith in the space I've been if you can go and get like you know the kind where okay the other day echo Charles going deep standby get some so I'm sitting on the couch right in big shocker there's a there's a so the remote control I have the kind where you know like the remote control for the cable and then for the volume they're two different so wait a second are we going against prioritize next cue does that what's happening no actually whenever I see a unit practicing only one thing at a time I'd remember of the history paper my son brought home one day the grammar construction and spelling were not good this is very poor English I told him but daddy said I was only being tested in history sound training requires that many subjects be skillfully integrated and taught concurrently this is an excellent time saver in training and he goes through this and any what he's saying is look you gotta do multiple things at the same time and even though prioritize an execute when you got multiple problems and you can't try and solve them all at the same time that doesn't mean that you're gonna say hold on a second we need to move towards the target That makes sense and I guess it probably makes sense to think that what it was leaning towards in the teams back in those days and probably in, you know, in the greater ground troops, the ground forces was that these, this idea of like going into a sustained ground combat was really, that route was really, it seemed like a less likely thing all the time, less and less likely that we were gonna actually, hey, we're gonna, if you would have told me in 1995, hey, the US year, the frog men of the 2000s and the 2010s are gonna do deployment after deployment, after deployment after deployment, after deployment, to the desert and they're gonna be fighting in ground combat sustained for two decades. oh it work here so much work everywhere like no it doesn't work everywhere this environment is optimized here this environment it doesn't work at all and if all you know is the mechanics and not what's happening behind it you actually can't apply it when it matters the most you know what that made me think of the book Leadership Strategy and Tactics by me because it's I say an exact same thing but when I'm talking I compare I compare a leader to a woodworker and talk about the fact that you know when you're a leader you got to know the different tools but we we crushed each other in those oral boards and one of the things that we figured out was which we got you know some of the senior guys said hey listen if you don't know the answer it's okay here's the response but rehearsing that and being ready for it is infinitely better than no rehearsal going there blind and get get smacked upside the head with something you didn't expect that you will talk yourself into that you've got to cover if you're doing this alone you'll tell yourself this isn't gonna be that hard I got this covered and you go in there solo you're gonna get crushed because you just you don't have that other person that to put you in a spot and go wow hang on a second training is important the well I didn't expect that I didn't see that coming I don't know what to say here and you also have to have the other person to just interact with you in a way that helps you anticipate a real response that you won't consider if you do it in your own brain which is a vacuum because what you can convince yourself is oh this isn't going to be that hard of a conversation I'm just going to say this he's going to say that and everything's going to be fine the role play winners we do to just to add one more thing to that when we do role play it usually comes right after we've done the initial training where we explain it he's god I love that with a reason or training is to take average people and make them exceptional superior results a unit to be truly outstanding should be excellent in all undertakings and activities commanders must know and understand that capabilities and limitations of personnel and set high and exacting standards of capabilities of the high ability of a group of units personnel this tends to give the low ability group a hopeless feeling because of having to compete against a standard which they cannot attain a unit satisfactory and all things is better than one outstanding in some excellent in others and unsatisfactory in a few that's a good thing to think about you know it's better to be good at a bunch I good at everything then outstanding at this one thing and I you know my response to him if I don't know what else to say I'm going to say Dave you know what I need to think about this for a minute let me just think about what you're saying because I want to make sure I understand that right there that right there is a response and it but I was like the volume one is like the volume one is somewhere else you know the kind you're looking around has to be close to you right because it's not like it's you know in the next room or something like that's not it doesn't have it's not gonna go far it's it's some other things in unsack in some final things next section fast forward a little bit emphasize fundamentals the basic difference between well trained unit and one that is not well trained is found in the attention paid to the fundamentals of marksmanship chemical biological and radiological warfare communications maintenance administration in all other arts and skills that contribute to making the unit combat ready in the shortest possible time a well trained soldier is the only foundation upon which effective combat ready units can be built when the soldier fails to demonstrate proficiency in individual skills the army's investment is wasted and the combat readiness of the unit is diminished each commander should approach his problems of combat readiness with a sense of wartime urgency there is no magic formula no sweatless solution to achieving a high state of combat readiness in a unit application the fundamentals enumerated below however will help so that by the way sweatless solution you've heard that before right that's that's that's hack well hack took that actual phrase well there you go alright so back to the book he's talking about the things that you can you can do to keep a unit trained up number one do essential things first there's not enough time for the commander to do everything each commander will have to determine wisely what is essential and a sign response abilities for accomplishment he should spend the remaining time on near essentials this is especially true of training not essential should not take up required time required for essentials what do we call that we call that prioritize next year next thing do things right the first time the commander should not consider his unit ready for battle until it can carry out a plan and they say we know I've got to go talk to this I'm going to talk to my subordinate leader who's got a giant ego and okay roll in there and just talk to him see how that goes it's going to be a disaster so you roll play and guess what the first time you roll play it's a disaster the second time it's 10 times better no don't don't don't do rehearsals yes do rehearsals a commander should take every opportunity to exploit the effects of integrated training it is the key to accelerate intensified unit combat training in effect it increases the amount of available training time good eliminate the habit eliminate the administrative habit in training I'm convinced that all commanders should take maximum advantage of field training time to develop correct tactical practices and procedures we talked about that one last time practice dispersion concealment and can of camouflage the penalty for bad habits and passive measures in air defense or warrants special mentioned the day when American soldier could be relaxed about dispersion concealment and camouflage is in the past okay seems like as a philosophy you know and how general Clark is saying subsequently hack worse subsequently Choco whether they're saying stop looking for the sweatless solution stop like straight up but just do the work stand up get through the remote control whatever this may be the apex of the echo Charles examples of just saying there's a lot of those you look like when you're vacuuming and then you had to go do an oral board for all the different departments and you had to go and program the radios and break down the weapons and build demolition charges and you know show how to put on a parachute rig and set up a diary you had to do all these different things and answer all these questions and one of the things that you learned was or you better have learned was when someone asked you a question that you don't know you better have a response for and the response is you know master chief but the the improvement of your response from a time when you don't know what's going to happen and you haven't practiced it to a time when you do know what's going to happen you have practiced it is exponential is absolutely exponential well the first time to often commanders hold rehearsals of things their unit should be able to do well without rehearsal I like this because this is like a little bit you know there's this mantra in the games about you should do one foot one third planning one third gear prep one third rehearsal we put all this emphasis in the rehearsal which is awesome and I 100% believe that You don't, and actually you don't have time to know everything you know, but you gotta know enough. but then you got a if you're a woodworker you've got to know the different tools and then you've got to know the different types of wood You know, like, what would, is there anything that would keep me from achieving that, you know, getting the workout done, some small, like such a small deal when I'm playing it out loud. and you didn't think could come and guess what you can actually train your response for the thing that you just came that came completely out of left field and it might be as simple as when Dave if Dave says something to me that I had no anticipation and it doesn't make any sense to me what am I going to do you know what I'm going to do? And there was enough hold over from the kind of the Cold War era of leadership, which is the 80s and you know, very early 90s was, hey, this stuff all travels in sign waves and sooner or later, what's going to happen is that there are ability, which is obviously we know that. You know, the ones that, like you could see the laser through the little lens almost kind of thing, you know? and I say hey Dave listen I know we promised you this product on this date we ran into some hiccups here's the mistakes that I made here's what we're going to try and do to resolve it you're only going to be able to say so many different things back to me and and depending on how I respond I could either salvage that relationship or I could destroy it it was almost like I was putting more effort into my sweatless solution then actual energy would have been expanded if I went for the sweat solution the real one you know put it in just stand up for a second you know so why would we not train to be prepared for this there's no reason there's no excuse for it it doesn't take a week to train for that situation takes ten minutes it does it takes ten minutes if your own brain is the only place where you consider the potential outcomes of that conversation you're going to miss so many things if I get one other person sit across for me to answer in any way that they want how I'm going to interact with them I actually now a reveal And there was always this, believe it or not, it held over there was always this specter of like, you know, great competition, you know, Russia and America, those type of things. If you're a sales person and you're not training alongside the operations people to make sure that you know how to communicate to them what you want and they know how to communicate to you what they can deliver. I don't know the tactic, I don't know how the things are going to play out. No, I probably don't need to know how to field strip every little, but you don't need to know how far that thing can shoot. And so when you got told, hey, you're going to do this type of mission, you just got told word amount of how you're going to do it. So we provided real training for the blue students, for the friendly fighters going out to fight, because if they went out and fought an enemy that wasn't performing the way a real enemy would, they were going to be unprepared. And it makes, you know, you're like, you know, go on it. I don't know exactly how it's gonna play out, but I do know what it's gonna be. That's an interesting little point to bring up is that, well, they're saying that you need to test the subordinate unit, so you know, subordinate leadership unit, you can't just, and this is true in the SEAL teams, I can't test myself. And then they're going to start going through the target and then the base of fire is going to shift off the target. But hearing what he's saying and the risk of creating it in your own mind and saying, this is what's going to go happen, go execute and setting your team up to fail for not being prepared for the thousands of contingencies that are absolutely going to happen with your plan. You seem saying, got the discipline for your mind, for your body, got won't for the protein, you know, all these things. oh really you should care what happens because if the client calls customer satisfaction it looks for a solution to a problem that they've got is they're implementing the thing that you just sold them and the solution isn't there guess what you're not getting good reviews and you're not going to sell anymore product to that company. When you talk about training individual soldiers, but when you start talking about training teams and training units, this is where things really start to come to light from a leadership perspective. and that's what he said or something he just just know should have some some standard operating positions that you should know look are we gonna rehearse some and we've got to fight a firefight if we only ever practice just getting in a firefight and just moving people how do we know how to do both those things at the same time which you may have to do so do you have to prioritize next you know it was a little rough but they got everything taken care of you should definitely call them you see what I'm going with us look I'm going to tell you guys this one time there we're going to go execute no rehearsals just to see just to just to get people in the mindset of paying attention and figuring out where your directions and your planning is a short fall because if I can't say And we like get the call like, hey, we got to go right now. The thing that I'll throw in there is, since you don't know what these contingencies are, you have to train people on what to do and they don't know what to do.
