00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.26
This is Jockel Podcast number 87.

2
00:00:04.26 --> 00:00:07.70
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.70 --> 00:00:08.70
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.70 --> 00:00:09.20
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.70 --> 00:00:18.30
I'd been away from infantry and from the army I'd grown up in for far too long.

6
00:00:19.50 --> 00:00:24.50
Walking through the gates of Coleman Barracks was stepping into the welcome past.

7
00:00:24.50 --> 00:00:28.50
The old army had not died after all.

8
00:00:28.50 --> 00:00:32.30
The 18th was military perfection.

9
00:00:32.30 --> 00:00:36.60
Men stepped smartly across meticulously kept grounds.

10
00:00:36.60 --> 00:00:43.20
Starched uniforms, blue infantry scarves, dazzling, shined brass and boots,

11
00:00:43.20 --> 00:00:52.50
snappy salutes, and cheerful, good afternoon, sirs, marked my journey to the HQ where I'd sign in.

12
00:00:52.50 --> 00:00:56.30
The spirit of this fine unit was already infecting me.

13
00:00:56.30 --> 00:01:01.60
The hot, stifling, windless day, the ragweed pollen that blew in from adjacent fields

14
00:01:01.60 --> 00:01:06.40
covering the camp and immediately activating my hay fever.

15
00:01:06.40 --> 00:01:11.20
The rundown, boring camp itself, none of it mattered.

16
00:01:11.20 --> 00:01:19.20
As inwardly I was transported to an island oasis, untouched by turbulence seas.

17
00:01:19.20 --> 00:01:26.20
And it was all thanks to one man, the battle group commanding officer who would forever be my model.

18
00:01:26.20 --> 00:01:29.20
Mentor and friend.

19
00:01:29.20 --> 00:01:40.20
Colonel Glover S. Johns was the finest senior infantry commander I'd ever seen, or ever would see again.

20
00:01:40.20 --> 00:01:44.70
We shared a mutual abiding respect almost from the moment we met.

21
00:01:44.70 --> 00:01:48.20
He was my kind of soldier and I was his.

22
00:01:48.20 --> 00:01:50.20
He was a warrior.

23
00:01:50.20 --> 00:01:57.20
Patons aid before World War II, then during the war he'd hit the beaches of Normandy as part of the 29th division

24
00:01:57.20 --> 00:02:03.20
and fought from those bloody shores all the way across Europe until victory was achieved.

25
00:02:03.20 --> 00:02:12.20
As a battalion commanding officer, he'd headed the task force that captured the critical French town of St. Low.

26
00:02:12.20 --> 00:02:19.20
In Korea he'd served as executive officer, then regimental commander in my own 40th division.

27
00:02:19.20 --> 00:02:22.20
His reputation there was awesome.

28
00:02:22.20 --> 00:02:29.20
One story that made its way through the division was that a wild new exo had come into the 2-2-4th

29
00:02:29.20 --> 00:02:34.20
gotten down on his belly and the mud to check the units machine guns, field of fire,

30
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:40.20
and promptly moved two-thirds of the machine gun bunkers that had sat there for two years.

31
00:02:40.20 --> 00:02:44.20
Later when he took over as commanding officer the 2-2-24th

32
00:02:44.20 --> 00:02:54.20
and the unit moved to a new sector he'd outposted a spur about 200 yards in front of one of his companies so the North Koreans couldn't do it first.

33
00:02:54.20 --> 00:03:01.20
But this move was considered seizing ground and against the no-win rules of the war.

34
00:03:01.20 --> 00:03:08.20
And soon the X-core commanding general flew down to John's position to discuss the matter with him.

35
00:03:08.20 --> 00:03:25.20
After examining the situation general white told him he could keep the spur but was never to advance again even his outpost line without express permission from core.

36
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:35.20
His blue eyes sparkle like those of a wise and truly tested man who long since realized that humor could be found in just about anything.

37
00:03:35.20 --> 00:03:38.20
He had seen his share of horror.

38
00:03:38.20 --> 00:03:48.20
His cheeks were rosy and the dueling scar that crossed one of them and no way detracted from his jen-rugged yet gentle old soldier face.

39
00:03:48.20 --> 00:03:51.20
Maybe the scar even enhanced it.

40
00:03:51.20 --> 00:03:57.20
I don't know but it sure gave him more character than provided a good yarn to boot.

41
00:03:57.20 --> 00:04:07.20
In any event Colonel Glover S. Johns was a 49 year old stud.

42
00:04:07.20 --> 00:04:12.20
Colonel Johns was a basics man and a total soldier.

43
00:04:12.20 --> 00:04:18.20
He taught and insisted that his company commanders teach things like terrain appreciation.

44
00:04:18.20 --> 00:04:26.20
The knowledge of which was a basic tool of a soldier's trade to be able to look at a piece of ground and appreciate the slightest differences in the contour.

45
00:04:26.20 --> 00:04:32.20
To notice how the ground unfolds and be able to think there's cover over there. Cover.

46
00:04:32.20 --> 00:04:36.20
The one essential providing protection from direct enemy fire.

47
00:04:36.20 --> 00:04:44.20
To recognize a streamlined, a gully or a tree-daria as an avenue of approach through which a unit could move unseen.

48
00:04:44.20 --> 00:04:50.20
To understand and identify the best ground from which to launch or repel an attack.

49
00:04:50.20 --> 00:04:54.20
Shoot, scoot and communicate.

50
00:04:54.20 --> 00:04:57.20
The morning battle drill began with fire and maneuver.

51
00:04:57.20 --> 00:05:00.20
One man firing while his buddy moved.

52
00:05:00.20 --> 00:05:04.20
A fire team moving while its counterpart fired.

53
00:05:04.20 --> 00:05:08.20
Colonel Johns likened it to a fighter's bobbing weaving and jabbing.

54
00:05:08.20 --> 00:05:14.20
We kept the mythical enemy pin down while we jabbed our way to close on his position.

55
00:05:14.20 --> 00:05:17.20
That's covered move by the way.

56
00:05:17.20 --> 00:05:25.20
The Colonel was right there with us to set the example and we did it until we got it right.

57
00:05:25.20 --> 00:05:34.20
We'd end up black and blue running, hitting the ground and rolling in defiring position with full field equipment on is not without pain.

58
00:05:34.20 --> 00:05:39.20
But no one bitched because Johns again and again reinforced the simple equation.

59
00:05:39.20 --> 00:05:46.20
The quicker you get to the ground and you get your weapon to position, the sooner you'll be delivering effective fire on the enemy and the longer you'll stay alive.

60
00:05:46.20 --> 00:05:56.20
Still, this trueism was just one part of the overall strife to better your best philosophy.

61
00:05:56.20 --> 00:06:05.20
That characterized the first 18 under Colonel Johns and deputy commanding officer, couch.

62
00:06:05.20 --> 00:06:15.20
In couches words, it was our policy to encourage excellence among the soldiers, particularly in bay and net training, unarmed combat.

63
00:06:15.20 --> 00:06:19.20
Shooting and total physical fitness.

64
00:06:19.20 --> 00:06:21.20
This is what really makes a soldier.

65
00:06:21.20 --> 00:06:25.20
If he masters these subjects, he'll fight.

66
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:33.20
From my experience in Korea, I could not have agreed more.

67
00:06:33.20 --> 00:06:41.20
So, that's a little opener from a book called About Face.

68
00:06:41.20 --> 00:06:51.20
My favorite book by Carl David Hackworth and he's talking about a guy that was his commander in the early 1960s.

69
00:06:51.20 --> 00:07:01.20
Hackworth had gotten out of the army and then came back in after a couple years because he realized civil in life was not fun.

70
00:07:01.20 --> 00:07:17.20
So he came back in and he got stationed in Germany and this guy by the name of Colonel Gloveress Johns, who by the way, he dedicates to the book to impotry men and to some other soldiers that he worked with along the way.

71
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:19.20
But to Glover Johns, he says,

72
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:33.20
Dedicates his book to Glover Johns who showed us how to lead.

73
00:07:33.20 --> 00:07:49.20
Glover Johns, not only from what he passes through Hackworth in Hackworth's book, but also from his own book.

74
00:07:49.20 --> 00:08:03.20
Low about his push from Normandy and across France that Hackworth just referenced. Now it's interesting when we go into this book, the clay pigeons are saying low.

75
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:09.20
He writes the book in the third person.

76
00:08:09.20 --> 00:08:13.20
And he says that it was just easier for him to write it that way.

77
00:08:13.20 --> 00:08:15.20
So in other words, he doesn't say, I did this and I did that. He says,

78
00:08:15.20 --> 00:08:23.20
he says, Major Johns did this and Major dog John said something else. But what's interesting is he said that one of the reasons he was able to do one of the reasons that he did that was because

79
00:08:23.20 --> 00:08:31.20
The guy that was commanding in combat was a battalion commander in combat was different from his normal self.

80
00:08:31.20 --> 00:08:41.20
And so he had this combat Johns combat Glover Johns. I was out there leading things and he had normal Johns that was the way he lived his normal life.

81
00:08:41.20 --> 00:08:47.20
But it was easier for him to write and more natural for him to write about this major Johns guy in the third person.

82
00:08:47.20 --> 00:08:55.20
And he also likes it because it gives him the ability to kind of detach from it and explain what was going on.

83
00:08:55.20 --> 00:09:01.20
So when you hear it, it's all about major Johns instead of being about me and about I.

84
00:09:01.20 --> 00:09:03.20
But it's it's him.

85
00:09:03.20 --> 00:09:15.20
And even though it's written from the third person, it is absolutely a first person account from a battalion commander in combat.

86
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:21.20
Close intense combat.

87
00:09:21.20 --> 00:09:31.20
And let's pick it up going to the book, the clay pigeons of St. Low.

88
00:09:31.20 --> 00:09:41.20
Here we go. Sharpe ballistic cracks pounded as ear drum so rapidly they seemed like one impossibly prolonged rifle shot.

89
00:09:41.20 --> 00:09:45.20
He was instantly paralyzed with overwhelming fright.

90
00:09:45.20 --> 00:09:51.20
The radio operator Jimmy slump forward at his feet. Another man stumble past a fall into the ditch ahead.

91
00:09:51.20 --> 00:09:57.20
Then Nukeum cleared the eight foot headrow apparently with one jump.

92
00:09:57.20 --> 00:10:01.20
It was too shocked to move. His stomach nodded itself into a tight ball.

93
00:10:01.20 --> 00:10:07.20
It jammed against his pounding heart while his breath stopped completely for an instant.

94
00:10:07.20 --> 00:10:09.20
Then came in jerky gasps.

95
00:10:09.20 --> 00:10:17.20
The hair on his head felt as if it were rising like the hair on a cat's back. His skin prickled all over.

96
00:10:17.20 --> 00:10:23.20
But the most awful thing was the cold empty feeling in his guts.

97
00:10:23.20 --> 00:10:31.20
The burst of German machine gun fire lasted only seconds, but it seemed like a lifetime before he could reach up and snatch her grenade from his pistol belt.

98
00:10:31.20 --> 00:10:38.20
He never heard a bullet crack by, inches from his head. He didn't know they sounded like that.

99
00:10:38.20 --> 00:10:43.20
He thought there was a German with a burp pistol behind the nearest tree on top of the headrow.

100
00:10:43.20 --> 00:10:49.20
He grabbed the pin on the grenade, but before he could throw it something made him stop and yell anybody on the other side.

101
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:52.20
He got a quick answer. Hell yes.

102
00:10:52.20 --> 00:10:58.20
Before he could lower his arm, the blast of a rifle, right in his lap made him flinch.

103
00:10:58.20 --> 00:11:04.20
He squirmed back even closer against the headrow as Martin and Grimsel went into action.

104
00:11:04.20 --> 00:11:13.20
They'd been at the front all eleven days since a continuous line had been established in Normandy.

105
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:16.20
The crack of bullets was nothing new to them.

106
00:11:16.20 --> 00:11:24.20
Almost side by side, lying flat in the ditch, they fired methodically across him and over Jimmy's head.

107
00:11:24.20 --> 00:11:33.20
Mechanically, he checked the pin in the grenade, then still little dazed hooked it back onto his belt harness.

108
00:11:33.20 --> 00:11:39.20
He looked at the man who had fallen in the ditch and now was trying to weekly push himself up.

109
00:11:39.20 --> 00:11:49.20
It was Lieutenant Sadler, his face already greenish gray with shock. He had been hit five or six times in the head, chest and both arms.

110
00:11:49.20 --> 00:11:53.20
Major John's new instinctively that Sadler was as good as dead.

111
00:11:53.20 --> 00:12:01.20
He called to him to lie still and take it easy, but the Charlie Company commander was already beyond hearing.

112
00:12:01.20 --> 00:12:08.20
John's felt that he ought to do something constructive, something to get their minds off the tragedy that had just struck.

113
00:12:08.20 --> 00:12:11.20
But it was without inspiration.

114
00:12:11.20 --> 00:12:13.20
Nearly numb.

115
00:12:13.20 --> 00:12:17.20
Hey you guys, yelled Grimsel. Let's scram out of here.

116
00:12:17.20 --> 00:12:24.20
That brought the commander out of the days he'd been in ever since the deafening burst of enemy fire, perhaps two minutes before.

117
00:12:24.20 --> 00:12:30.20
He leaned forward and shook Jimmy's shoulder. Come on Jim, it's all over now. You can get up.

118
00:12:30.20 --> 00:12:35.20
But Jimmy didn't move. Major John's shook him again.

119
00:12:35.20 --> 00:12:41.20
Then he saw blood oozing slowly, thickly, brightly across his own shoe.

120
00:12:41.20 --> 00:12:53.20
Gently, he pulled a Jimmy's far shoulder. A neat, clean little bullet hole in the boys helmet came in to view, so the major knew that Jimmy was dead.

121
00:12:53.20 --> 00:12:59.20
Something impelled him to pull Jimmy over until he could look into his face.

122
00:12:59.20 --> 00:13:08.20
The eyes were closed and an odd little half smile made Jimmy look as if he were asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams.

123
00:13:08.20 --> 00:13:30.20
Slowly, the major lowered him back to the ground and for a fleeting instant watched Jimmy's life blood continue to flow across his shoe.

124
00:13:30.20 --> 00:13:41.20
So that's his first experience in combat.

125
00:13:41.20 --> 00:13:48.20
And you can see obviously it's a hell of a wake-up call.

126
00:13:48.20 --> 00:14:06.20
And the whole book is like this. It's an incredible book. The way he describes the battles and how they're laid out and the way he lays out his own thoughts and what's going on.

127
00:14:06.20 --> 00:14:09.20
It's just an outstanding book.

128
00:14:09.20 --> 00:14:20.20
It's one of these books where as I had to consciously say to myself, okay, Joko, you cannot read this whole book on the podcast. We need to, you know, people need to read it for themselves.

129
00:14:20.20 --> 00:14:27.20
But the book is the description of combat like that opening is phenomenal.

130
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:47.20
So let's go back to the book now where that first battles over and he's having some thoughts. Here we go back to the book. As he walked, he couldn't keep his thoughts away from the hot spot he'd been in a few minutes before and the lessons he learned so quickly, but it's such a price.

131
00:14:47.20 --> 00:14:58.20
A little more than an hour of his first fight, he lost two company commanders, two radio operators and three other men besides just escaping death himself.

132
00:14:58.20 --> 00:15:08.20
As he thought about the crack of those machine gun bullets, his stomach began to squirm again until by a conscious effort he forced it to behave.

133
00:15:08.20 --> 00:15:12.20
He couldn't understand why he hadn't been hit to.

134
00:15:12.20 --> 00:15:22.20
The company's head had been not more than two feet from his own. Newcome in the front and sather directly behind him had been hit.

135
00:15:22.20 --> 00:15:31.20
The whole burst must have missed him by scant inches he decided and he very seriously thanked God for his safety.

136
00:15:31.20 --> 00:15:38.20
At the same time, he promised never again to risk the lives of others if he could avoid it.

137
00:15:38.20 --> 00:15:48.20
The bitter lesson repeated every time the eyes of his mind focused on Jimmy's bright blood oozing over his shoe or on Sadler's sudden death.

138
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:57.20
He looked down at the shoe, shuddered at the still red stain and tried to scuff it off on the grass.

139
00:15:57.20 --> 00:16:04.20
On his way to the regimental command post, the major passed a knocked-out Sherman tank.

140
00:16:04.20 --> 00:16:17.20
The distinguished this smoking brown Hulk from others he had seen that day was the single blackened claw-like hand in forearm that was thrust out of the turret toward the sky.

141
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:25.20
The fingers were separate and more than half curled like the talent of a striking eagle.

142
00:16:25.20 --> 00:16:40.20
But this hand was not striking. It seemed rather to be calling down an implication on the fate that it let it die there in agony.

143
00:16:40.20 --> 00:16:45.20
So now he gets to the regimental commander well, boom the regimental commander, what's going on?

144
00:16:45.20 --> 00:16:52.20
I've just been trying to get to you. John saluted as he answered, sir, we're stuck at the second headrow.

145
00:16:52.20 --> 00:17:00.20
And I had to use my reserve to protect my flanks. It doesn't look as if we'll get to the forge today unless we have better luck later.

146
00:17:00.20 --> 00:17:09.20
Have many casualties? I don't know about the companies yet because I haven't had any reports from them except the yells about their flanks and counter attacks.

147
00:17:09.20 --> 00:17:19.20
But Nab was wounded early. Sadler is dead and I've lost two operators besides three other men out of my own CP group.

148
00:17:19.20 --> 00:17:25.20
He was still too full of his experience not to want to tell about it. The Colonel listened sympathetically.

149
00:17:25.20 --> 00:17:31.20
Well, he said when the major was through, we've got to keep going regardless.

150
00:17:31.20 --> 00:17:37.20
Division wants to get the forge tonight.

151
00:17:37.20 --> 00:17:42.20
So, yeah, you just had that rough day first day of combat. Guess what? We're still going.

152
00:17:42.20 --> 00:17:50.20
And you know, one of the things that in that opening paragraph that I pointed out was you could see his reaction when that first gunfight broke out.

153
00:17:50.20 --> 00:17:55.20
His reaction was sort of overwhelming overwhelmed by the whole scenario.

154
00:17:55.20 --> 00:18:03.20
But his two guys and what happened is, and you know, he talks about this in the book, but he had gone on to Normandy, but he wasn't in charge of a battalion yet.

155
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:07.20
He was sort of back with the regimental command.

156
00:18:07.20 --> 00:18:17.20
And then one of the battalion commanders was out of the fight and I figured if the battalion commander was killed or wounded, but he went and took this battalion commanders job.

157
00:18:17.20 --> 00:18:23.20
So he wasn't on the real front lines until they were starting to push through France a little bit.

158
00:18:23.20 --> 00:18:25.20
Then it was only a matter of days.

159
00:18:25.20 --> 00:18:31.20
But these, well, I guess it was 11 days because these guys, he said that these other guys had been on the front lines for 11 days.

160
00:18:31.20 --> 00:18:38.20
So these guys, it's been 11 days, but guess what, they start getting shot at boom, they're in the mode, they're returning fire.

161
00:18:38.20 --> 00:18:43.20
And you could see the returning fire really so close that it scared him.

162
00:18:43.20 --> 00:18:44.20
Yeah.

163
00:18:44.20 --> 00:18:51.20
And that's one of the things that, you know, a lot of times I talk about simunition and training with simunition and how awesome it is.

164
00:18:51.20 --> 00:18:59.20
And that's totally true. And I love training with simunition and it really is very beneficial for your tactical skill level.

165
00:18:59.20 --> 00:19:06.20
But you also absolutely have to do live fire. And the reason you have to do live fire, I mean there's a bunch of reasons you have to do it.

166
00:19:06.20 --> 00:19:12.20
You have to learn to shoot real bullets and hit real targets or with your bullets.

167
00:19:12.20 --> 00:19:16.20
But also guns are loud.

168
00:19:16.20 --> 00:19:27.20
And you need to condition yourself to be used to having a Mark 48 machine gun for inches, maybe not for inches, but like 16 inches from your head.

169
00:19:27.20 --> 00:19:34.20
And your buddy is dumping rounds down range and you have to be able to think during that and not be overwhelmed by it.

170
00:19:34.20 --> 00:19:39.20
Yeah, the simunition, this one's an ass like, how what's the difference in loudness?

171
00:19:39.20 --> 00:19:40.20
It's not even comparable.

172
00:19:40.20 --> 00:19:42.20
So it's not even really like gun shot.

173
00:19:42.20 --> 00:19:44.20
No, it's not comparable.

174
00:19:44.20 --> 00:19:45.20
It's not comparable.

175
00:19:45.20 --> 00:19:46.20
The noise is not comparable.

176
00:19:46.20 --> 00:19:48.20
The noise is less than a cap gun.

177
00:19:48.20 --> 00:19:51.20
Oh, yeah, like an airsoft.

178
00:19:51.20 --> 00:19:52.20
A gun is loud.

179
00:19:52.20 --> 00:19:54.20
And a Mark 48 machine gun.

180
00:19:54.20 --> 00:19:58.20
It's really loud. And it's sending little shock waves.

181
00:19:58.20 --> 00:20:00.20
Yeah, every round is a little shock wave that you get.

182
00:20:00.20 --> 00:20:01.20
Little.

183
00:20:01.20 --> 00:20:05.20
And so that's why it is so important to train live fire.

184
00:20:05.20 --> 00:20:07.20
And it's also important to be comfortable.

185
00:20:07.20 --> 00:20:16.20
Not only yourself shooting in close proximity with other people, but also them shooting near you because you've got to trust the guys that around you.

186
00:20:16.20 --> 00:20:23.20
Now there's standard operating procedures that there's things that you don't do that keep it safe.

187
00:20:23.20 --> 00:20:29.20
But it's still, I mean, when somebody makes a bad, if somebody makes a really bad mistake, they can walk into your field of fire.

188
00:20:29.20 --> 00:20:35.20
And so you have to be heads up, but you still have to take shots with people that are really close to you.

189
00:20:35.20 --> 00:20:37.20
Yeah, in a firefight, by the way.

190
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:45.20
Well, yeah, in a firefight, but if you haven't done it during training, your first minute in a firefight is going to be just overwhelmed.

191
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:47.20
And you're not going to be overwhelmed by enemy fire.

192
00:20:47.20 --> 00:20:51.20
You're going to be overwhelmed by your own got shooting.

193
00:20:51.20 --> 00:20:57.20
And you're going to be hitting hitting hip by brass and and just it hurts.

194
00:20:57.20 --> 00:21:04.20
Yeah, hop brass and the links coming out of a Mark 48 are like little weapons themselves.

195
00:21:04.20 --> 00:21:06.20
And then hit your hip.

196
00:21:06.20 --> 00:21:11.20
Yeah, we had a one of our machine gunners was a lefty and he picked up and started shooting.

197
00:21:11.20 --> 00:21:14.20
He picked up a machine gun and started shooting left handed.

198
00:21:14.20 --> 00:21:18.20
And that dumps the brass basically right off to your right by step.

199
00:21:18.20 --> 00:21:26.20
And he had a he had a bruise on his on his right arm that looked like somebody beat him with a with a baseball bat in the arm.

200
00:21:26.20 --> 00:21:32.20
That's what a Mark 48 ejector port does to you doesn't play around.

201
00:21:32.20 --> 00:21:41.20
So again, going back to the situation he's in right now, he's he's had all these casualties and they're like the major says hey, yep.

202
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:50.20
Regardless, we got to keep going, which is which is the way war actually is.

203
00:21:50.20 --> 00:22:01.20
So that night, he has a little company little huddle with the company commanders and you know, just to just to kind of spell this out if you're wondering what this is all about.

204
00:22:01.20 --> 00:22:05.20
So he's got the easy battalion commander.

205
00:22:05.20 --> 00:22:14.20
So and he's actually got this right now in the book, but a battalion battalion in 1944 was about 900 guys 900 men 28 officers.

206
00:22:14.20 --> 00:22:21.20
You got three companies the three companies are broken down into three platoons each one of those platoons has a platoon leader.

207
00:22:21.20 --> 00:22:24.20
Each one of the companies has a company commander using a captain.

208
00:22:24.20 --> 00:22:27.20
And so that's what he's talking about.

209
00:22:27.20 --> 00:22:34.20
So he so that those are your kind of your 150 man fighting elements are these companies with three platoons in them of 50 people each about.

210
00:22:34.20 --> 00:22:41.20
And it's weird because people always think that the military is everything's perfectly structured, but actually this this changes all the time.

211
00:22:41.20 --> 00:22:48.20
Not based on but based on your mission, you know, sometimes you you might have a platoon that needs to get plus stuff or a company that's short of people.

212
00:22:48.20 --> 00:22:52.20
So if there's no there's no consistent just all the time number.

213
00:22:52.20 --> 00:22:59.20
Let me see what he says the actual number that they were supposed to have in a company at this time was.

214
00:22:59.20 --> 00:23:06.20
The rifle company was made up of six officers and 186 men that's what they're supposed to have in them.

215
00:23:06.20 --> 00:23:13.20
Now you're going to find out real quick that they rarely have even close to 100, but that's what they're supposed to have.

216
00:23:13.20 --> 00:23:22.20
So at this point, he's bringing in these three company commanders to talk to them about kind of a plan and also to get a debrief.

217
00:23:22.20 --> 00:23:28.20
On on what happened during the day and what their plan to do had here we go back to the book.

218
00:23:28.20 --> 00:23:37.20
And then he got a moment and this is this is one of the company commander's name, Lieutenant Ryan and he's talking and he says he thought a moment and then added, we might make it across the road.

219
00:23:37.20 --> 00:23:42.20
If we pour a lot of smoke and mortars into them and then rush them, but it'll take but it's getting off.

220
00:23:42.20 --> 00:23:45.20
We wait to be beating around in this kind of country.

221
00:23:45.20 --> 00:23:54.20
So trying to figure out how to move forward and Lieutenant Ryan that was kind of lieutenant Ryan suggestion let's mortar them put a bunch of smoke out and then we can move but guess what, it's getting late.

222
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:56.88
Once it gets dark, it's going to get scary.

223
00:23:56.88 --> 00:23:58.52
Ryan stopped and looked at Kenny.

224
00:23:58.52 --> 00:23:59.80
It was Kenny's turn.

225
00:23:59.80 --> 00:24:03.20
And Kenny, you're going to find out, is a legit badass.

226
00:24:03.20 --> 00:24:08.08
Sir, I only had a few minutes to look things over before Wendell came along and invited me

227
00:24:08.08 --> 00:24:11.24
back here to see you, but that orchard is a terrible place.

228
00:24:11.24 --> 00:24:12.64
No cover anywhere.

229
00:24:12.64 --> 00:24:14.36
Machine guns covering every inch of it.

230
00:24:14.36 --> 00:24:17.36
We lost a lot of men in there the first time.

231
00:24:17.36 --> 00:24:19.000
He paused.

232
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.96
But we'll do the best we can.

233
00:24:21.96 --> 00:24:30.52
Well, rougher not, we're going ahead, the major stated flatly.

234
00:24:30.52 --> 00:24:35.80
By the way, Kenny just took over for one of the company commanders that had been Wendell

235
00:24:35.80 --> 00:24:37.52
killed.

236
00:24:37.52 --> 00:24:43.96
Now they start pushing and all of a sudden they're pushing forward and again, I have to

237
00:24:43.96 --> 00:24:48.92
skip through this book and I'm trying to highlight the leadership scenarios or the things

238
00:24:48.92 --> 00:24:57.08
that reveal the way human beings react in hard situations.

239
00:24:57.08 --> 00:25:01.68
But when you read this book yourself, you can really follow the tactical decision-making

240
00:25:01.68 --> 00:25:05.64
process and also how the battles went and what happened.

241
00:25:05.64 --> 00:25:08.44
Obviously I can't go through the whole thing right now.

242
00:25:08.44 --> 00:25:12.12
But at this point, they had started pressing and all of a sudden he sees guys running

243
00:25:12.12 --> 00:25:13.12
away, running.

244
00:25:13.12 --> 00:25:16.56
So as the company commander, and he talks about this where he positions himself, and

245
00:25:16.56 --> 00:25:20.08
obviously doesn't position himself right on the front with the platoons, he's back a little

246
00:25:20.08 --> 00:25:21.08
bit.

247
00:25:21.08 --> 00:25:23.60
At this point, guys start, he sees guys running back towards him.

248
00:25:23.60 --> 00:25:27.76
At first he thinks it might be Germans, he's no it's Americans, it's his guys.

249
00:25:27.76 --> 00:25:29.96
And here we go back to the book, the major got to his feet.

250
00:25:29.96 --> 00:25:31.96
He started a crouching run to the left.

251
00:25:31.96 --> 00:25:35.60
He had nearly reached the end of the field when four or five men yelling, don't shoot,

252
00:25:35.60 --> 00:25:40.64
don't shoot, piled over the hedgero that separated Charlie and Baker companies.

253
00:25:40.64 --> 00:25:43.04
He stopped carbine alert.

254
00:25:43.04 --> 00:25:47.32
As he lowered his gun, wondering what this was all about, a figure stepped out from the

255
00:25:47.32 --> 00:25:50.32
hedgero and voiced the same question.

256
00:25:50.32 --> 00:25:52.16
What's going on here anyway?

257
00:25:52.16 --> 00:25:54.16
Just what's this all about?

258
00:25:54.16 --> 00:25:59.84
It was Lieutenant Iperian, arms spread wide to catch the running men, carbine slung over

259
00:25:59.84 --> 00:26:03.68
his shoulder, the picture of calm.

260
00:26:03.68 --> 00:26:08.000
He caught the leading man by his jacket, which piled the others up in a tight little

261
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.16
knot.

262
00:26:09.16 --> 00:26:14.80
The man panted crowds, paratroopers that right behind us run.

263
00:26:14.80 --> 00:26:18.88
Appearian glanced over the man's shoulder, unmoved.

264
00:26:18.88 --> 00:26:23.04
Well now, I don't see any crowds just look.

265
00:26:23.04 --> 00:26:27.64
The men looked back, all they could see were several Charlie company men standing quietly

266
00:26:27.64 --> 00:26:29.32
rifles ready.

267
00:26:29.32 --> 00:26:33.48
The leader of the runaways relaxed, then shuttered violently.

268
00:26:33.48 --> 00:26:34.48
Appearian went on.

269
00:26:34.48 --> 00:26:37.88
I don't think there's any crowds chasing you at all.

270
00:26:37.88 --> 00:26:39.32
Just go see about this.

271
00:26:39.32 --> 00:26:41.60
The man tried to pull away from him, but there were.

272
00:26:41.60 --> 00:26:42.60
He cried.

273
00:26:42.60 --> 00:26:43.60
There were.

274
00:26:43.60 --> 00:26:47.28
I tell you, they came right over the hedgero and shot down right down the whole squad.

275
00:26:47.28 --> 00:26:49.12
They got the sergeant and all the rest.

276
00:26:49.12 --> 00:26:50.52
Where the only one's left.

277
00:26:50.52 --> 00:26:51.80
They nearly got me.

278
00:26:51.80 --> 00:26:52.80
Look.

279
00:26:52.80 --> 00:26:55.60
He poked a finger through a hole in his jacket.

280
00:26:55.60 --> 00:27:00.66
But Iperian, unimpressed, moved in the direction of Baker Company even as the man protested,

281
00:27:00.66 --> 00:27:04.000
dragging him along while the others followed me clearly.

282
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.28
Well, Iperian went on.

283
00:27:06.28 --> 00:27:10.52
Just go see what Captain Weddle has to say about the all this.

284
00:27:10.52 --> 00:27:13.32
He called softly to the men guarding the company flank.

285
00:27:13.32 --> 00:27:14.56
See anything?

286
00:27:14.56 --> 00:27:15.56
No sir.

287
00:27:15.56 --> 00:27:17.96
The answer came back quickly and calmly.

288
00:27:17.96 --> 00:27:21.64
The mortar observer in his little group of panic stricken men disappeared over the

289
00:27:21.64 --> 00:27:23.20
hedgero.

290
00:27:23.20 --> 00:27:29.08
The major new he had just seen a wonderful example of leadership at its very finest.

291
00:27:29.08 --> 00:27:36.80
Iperian quickly, calmly and efficiently had stopped what could have been around.

292
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:43.40
So one leader steps out and really what he's doing, we think about it.

293
00:27:43.40 --> 00:27:48.80
He's detached because he wasn't in that situation where some Germans came over and obviously

294
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:51.16
shot at him or close range, killed a couple of guys.

295
00:27:51.16 --> 00:27:57.12
You know, would have wounded this soldier who got shot through his jacket.

296
00:27:57.12 --> 00:27:59.28
And he just gets, he kind of gets the guy to attach.

297
00:27:59.28 --> 00:28:01.16
Hey, look, there's no one there.

298
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:02.16
Calm down.

299
00:28:02.16 --> 00:28:03.16
Let's go have a look.

300
00:28:03.16 --> 00:28:05.40
Let's take a step back.

301
00:28:05.40 --> 00:28:10.84
And that kind of calmness prevented everyone because what can go in the other direction?

302
00:28:10.84 --> 00:28:11.84
Right?

303
00:28:11.84 --> 00:28:12.84
What can go in the other direction?

304
00:28:12.84 --> 00:28:13.84
You see people running?

305
00:28:13.84 --> 00:28:14.84
That's what happened.

306
00:28:14.84 --> 00:28:15.84
Do you see people running?

307
00:28:15.84 --> 00:28:16.84
You start running.

308
00:28:16.84 --> 00:28:20.84
And you know that that was very interesting in the, I don't know if you remember some of those

309
00:28:20.84 --> 00:28:26.04
police shootings where I remember there's one in New York City where something like

310
00:28:26.04 --> 00:28:31.000
57 rounds were fired at somebody that was unarmed.

311
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.76
And everyone's going, why?

312
00:28:32.76 --> 00:28:33.76
Why was everyone shooting?

313
00:28:33.76 --> 00:28:38.80
And I'll tell you what happens is, you know, for some reason they think, if you think

314
00:28:38.80 --> 00:28:42.52
somebody has a weapon or a suspect or is going to do something bad.

315
00:28:42.52 --> 00:28:46.60
And now you've got five or six people that are holding a gun on them.

316
00:28:46.60 --> 00:28:52.44
Well, when one's person starts shooting, when people are not detached and when people

317
00:28:52.44 --> 00:28:56.12
are caught up in the moment and everyone starts pulling the trigger.

318
00:28:56.12 --> 00:29:00.52
And it's, it can be really devastating.

319
00:29:00.52 --> 00:29:02.36
It can be really devastating.

320
00:29:02.36 --> 00:29:08.36
So when people are used to that kind of stress and they're calm and they're detached.

321
00:29:08.36 --> 00:29:09.84
One person takes a shot.

322
00:29:09.84 --> 00:29:13.64
You actually, instead of just firing yourself, you actually assess and say, okay, what is

323
00:29:13.64 --> 00:29:14.64
he shooting at?

324
00:29:14.64 --> 00:29:15.80
I need to get cover.

325
00:29:15.80 --> 00:29:22.04
So that's why that training is so important to get people at a high stress level.

326
00:29:22.04 --> 00:29:25.28
And still think through things and still be detached.

327
00:29:25.28 --> 00:29:29.72
The stress is going to be there, put it in a box, monitor it, don't get in it.

328
00:29:29.72 --> 00:29:31.60
Because you're going to make bad decisions.

329
00:29:31.60 --> 00:29:32.60
You might not make any decision.

330
00:29:32.60 --> 00:29:36.000
You might just go off your reactions, which I'm sitting here with a gun.

331
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
People are shooting.

332
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I'm going to shoot too.

333
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.28
Yeah, that's not, I mean, it's like, I'd say when you're not trained, you don't have

334
00:29:42.28 --> 00:29:46.56
experience in those types of situations like the shooting example.

335
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:47.56
Yeah.

336
00:29:47.56 --> 00:29:50.88
It's one of those things where you see in jiu-jitsu when you start it's exactly the exact

337
00:29:50.88 --> 00:29:51.88
same thing.

338
00:29:51.88 --> 00:29:55.68
So in a shooting situation, one guy shoots, you hear the gun fire.

339
00:29:55.68 --> 00:29:58.48
Basically your brain just says, okay, it's on.

340
00:29:58.48 --> 00:29:59.48
Yeah.

341
00:29:59.48 --> 00:30:00.48
It's on 100%.

342
00:30:00.48 --> 00:30:01.48
Let's go.

343
00:30:01.48 --> 00:30:02.28
A full speed 100% it's on.

344
00:30:02.28 --> 00:30:04.44
You can't like, shots are being fired.

345
00:30:04.44 --> 00:30:06.16
It's not on.

346
00:30:06.16 --> 00:30:07.28
You've got to go 100%.

347
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:11.56
So in jiu-jitsu when you first start, you know how like, like, guys, just going full speed

348
00:30:11.56 --> 00:30:12.96
the whole time, you know.

349
00:30:12.96 --> 00:30:15.28
You're going to spot where I was like, you can't move here.

350
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:17.20
You can't, you're completely trapped right here.

351
00:30:17.20 --> 00:30:18.20
That's the mission necessarily.

352
00:30:18.20 --> 00:30:19.20
But you're trapped.

353
00:30:19.20 --> 00:30:21.000
And I got to go in crazy, you know?

354
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Because you don't know.

355
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
It's on.

356
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
It's on.

357
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
It's not on.

358
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Yeah.

359
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.08
So when you're saying the difference is though, what you're talking about is an individual

360
00:30:29.08 --> 00:30:32.16
individual moment, what I'm talking about is group.

361
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:33.96
It's a group thinks scenario.

362
00:30:33.96 --> 00:30:34.96
Yeah.

363
00:30:34.96 --> 00:30:39.80
Where, you know, just like, it happens when there's a gun shot and everyone starts

364
00:30:39.80 --> 00:30:40.80
running.

365
00:30:40.80 --> 00:30:43.08
People, the people in the background don't even know what they're running.

366
00:30:43.08 --> 00:30:44.08
Gotcha.

367
00:30:44.08 --> 00:30:45.08
They see people running.

368
00:30:45.08 --> 00:30:46.08
Yeah.

369
00:30:46.08 --> 00:30:47.08
Yeah.

370
00:30:47.08 --> 00:30:48.08
Yeah.

371
00:30:48.08 --> 00:30:49.08
Yeah.

372
00:30:49.08 --> 00:30:50.08
Yeah.

373
00:30:50.08 --> 00:30:55.40
And before you're police partners, or you're, or your, you're military partners,

374
00:30:55.40 --> 00:30:56.40
you're looking down now.

375
00:30:56.40 --> 00:31:00.52
You think there's an insurgent there and all of a sudden around cracks off.

376
00:31:00.52 --> 00:31:01.76
You're lucky.

377
00:31:01.76 --> 00:31:07.16
And there's a situation that happened where there was an Iraqi soldier that had an accidental

378
00:31:07.16 --> 00:31:08.16
discharge.

379
00:31:08.16 --> 00:31:09.16
You know what that is?

380
00:31:09.16 --> 00:31:11.40
Like, it was latin and latin.

381
00:31:11.40 --> 00:31:15.06
And latin latin was taken down a building.

382
00:31:15.06 --> 00:31:19.96
And I was actually outside the building, because we were taking down multiple the buildings.

383
00:31:19.96 --> 00:31:23.36
but they were in one building and all of a sudden,

384
00:31:23.36 --> 00:31:26.72
ack, ack, a couple rounds get shot off.

385
00:31:26.72 --> 00:31:28.76
And you know what, it was actually,

386
00:31:28.76 --> 00:31:33.26
I'm pretty sure that it was a pretty sure Andrew Paul.

387
00:31:33.26 --> 00:31:34.36
This is a whole cast of characters.

388
00:31:34.36 --> 00:31:36.40
I'm pretty sure Andrew Paul is at like the head

389
00:31:36.40 --> 00:31:38.40
of the train or close to the front of the train

390
00:31:38.40 --> 00:31:40.90
in inside that they were inside this building,

391
00:31:40.90 --> 00:31:43.88
rounds get fired and Andrew Paul's thinking,

392
00:31:43.88 --> 00:31:46.24
okay, I think I remember Andrew Paul telling me this.

393
00:31:46.24 --> 00:31:47.28
Andrew Paul's like, okay, well,

394
00:31:47.28 --> 00:31:48.36
we're gonna grenade these.

395
00:31:48.36 --> 00:31:50.04
We're gonna throw frag grenades into this next room

396
00:31:50.04 --> 00:31:51.56
because people are shooting at us.

397
00:31:51.56 --> 00:31:53.84
And it was a guy, another heads up guy,

398
00:31:53.84 --> 00:31:57.72
a couple feet back that knew where the gunfire came from

399
00:31:57.72 --> 00:31:59.84
and where it came from was an Iraqi soldier.

400
00:31:59.84 --> 00:32:03.20
Friendly Iraqi soldier had cracked off rounds

401
00:32:03.20 --> 00:32:04.68
and accidentally.

402
00:32:04.68 --> 00:32:08.68
Accidentally and you know, luckily that guy

403
00:32:08.68 --> 00:32:10.40
was a great guy of really heads up guy,

404
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:12.32
grabbed him almost, almost,

405
00:32:12.32 --> 00:32:15.16
just choked the shit out of him right there.

406
00:32:15.16 --> 00:32:17.80
But can you imagine you're clearing a house

407
00:32:17.80 --> 00:32:19.84
where there's suspected insurgents

408
00:32:19.84 --> 00:32:21.20
and all of a sudden rounds are fired?

409
00:32:21.20 --> 00:32:24.04
Well, now you're, but this is the discipline.

410
00:32:24.04 --> 00:32:27.000
And the guys knew, okay, the guys didn't all just

411
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.48
freak out and started shooting.

412
00:32:28.48 --> 00:32:30.28
The guys were, you know, somebody said,

413
00:32:30.28 --> 00:32:32.68
hey, somebody grabbed the person that shot,

414
00:32:32.68 --> 00:32:35.56
hey, that was an AD, okay, wrap it back down,

415
00:32:35.56 --> 00:32:37.40
wind it down, everyone calm, you know what I mean?

416
00:32:37.40 --> 00:32:39.96
So there's the difference between guys

417
00:32:39.96 --> 00:32:41.04
that have been trained really well.

418
00:32:41.04 --> 00:32:42.44
And when you haven't been through that country

419
00:32:42.44 --> 00:32:44.64
and also luckily that didn't happen

420
00:32:44.64 --> 00:32:46.80
on the second night of deployment.

421
00:32:46.80 --> 00:32:49.36
We were, you know, further into the deployment

422
00:32:49.36 --> 00:32:51.32
where guys had been through,

423
00:32:51.32 --> 00:32:52.96
it's just like we just talked about.

424
00:32:52.96 --> 00:32:55.84
Guys had been through plenty of fire fights at this point

425
00:32:55.84 --> 00:32:58.32
so they weren't freaked out that there was gunshots.

426
00:32:58.32 --> 00:32:59.40
They were like, okay, wait a second,

427
00:32:59.40 --> 00:33:01.68
where is this gunshots coming from?

428
00:33:01.68 --> 00:33:04.12
But that could have gone really, really nasty.

429
00:33:05.40 --> 00:33:07.68
So trained, trained realistically.

430
00:33:09.20 --> 00:33:10.72
All right, at this point

431
00:33:10.72 --> 00:33:12.84
and also just like some of the other books

432
00:33:12.84 --> 00:33:14.48
we've read about World War II

433
00:33:14.48 --> 00:33:18.08
where we've got, you know, it's basically a movement.

434
00:33:18.08 --> 00:33:19.80
It's basically continually moving,

435
00:33:19.80 --> 00:33:21.84
trying to take down targets, trying to move forward,

436
00:33:21.84 --> 00:33:24.16
trying to get through France, trying to get to Berlin.

437
00:33:24.16 --> 00:33:27.12
That's the situation and it's the same thing here.

438
00:33:27.12 --> 00:33:29.36
These guys, these battains in this regimen

439
00:33:29.36 --> 00:33:31.80
and they basically, the whole task force

440
00:33:31.80 --> 00:33:34.52
is trying to move from city to city

441
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:36.24
or town to town through France.

442
00:33:36.24 --> 00:33:37.88
And that's what's going on here.

443
00:33:37.88 --> 00:33:41.80
So it's a continual series of attack,

444
00:33:41.80 --> 00:33:45.24
dig in, attack, dig in, attack, dig in

445
00:33:45.24 --> 00:33:47.36
and you can tell from the title of the book,

446
00:33:47.36 --> 00:33:50.12
what they're going for is this final,

447
00:33:50.12 --> 00:33:53.28
you know, city of St. Low in France.

448
00:33:53.28 --> 00:33:55.80
So at this point, there's an attack

449
00:33:55.80 --> 00:33:57.08
that they were getting ready to go on

450
00:33:57.08 --> 00:34:00.60
and he's trying to figure out why it got canceled

451
00:34:00.60 --> 00:34:05.24
and he's talking to the commander.

452
00:34:05.24 --> 00:34:07.20
And he says, I think you got farther

453
00:34:07.20 --> 00:34:09.68
from where you started than anyone else.

454
00:34:09.68 --> 00:34:11.40
So he's telling these gentlemen, Major Jones,

455
00:34:11.40 --> 00:34:13.80
your battalion went further than anyone else.

456
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:16.000
Back to the book, in fact, I believe that's why

457
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.44
division canceled your attack.

458
00:34:18.44 --> 00:34:21.16
If you'd made La Forge, you would have been way out

459
00:34:21.16 --> 00:34:24.76
on a limb and stood a chance of being cut off.

460
00:34:24.76 --> 00:34:27.76
Major Jones, a lady that their comparative success,

461
00:34:27.76 --> 00:34:30.80
was thankful that he had not renewed the attack

462
00:34:30.80 --> 00:34:34.64
and perhaps made another 500 or 1,000 yards.

463
00:34:34.64 --> 00:34:37.44
They would have been out front like clay pigeons

464
00:34:37.44 --> 00:34:39.16
for anyone to knock down.

465
00:34:39.16 --> 00:34:42.64
It was the first time he had seen a practical application

466
00:34:42.64 --> 00:34:46.28
of what was popularly known as the big picture.

467
00:34:46.28 --> 00:34:49.84
Supposedly concocted for edification of high brass

468
00:34:49.84 --> 00:34:52.44
and war correspondence yet sufficiently vague

469
00:34:52.44 --> 00:34:55.12
to cover a certain amount of error on the ground.

470
00:34:56.32 --> 00:34:58.60
So the reason I wanted to call that out

471
00:34:58.60 --> 00:35:03.60
is he's admitting that from his perspective

472
00:35:03.60 --> 00:35:05.28
like why are you stopping my attack?

473
00:35:05.28 --> 00:35:07.08
And at this point, they had gotten bogged down

474
00:35:07.08 --> 00:35:08.04
and then they were ready to go again

475
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:10.88
and they got bogged down and now they were ready to go

476
00:35:10.88 --> 00:35:12.44
and they get told stop.

477
00:35:12.44 --> 00:35:13.64
And so his first reaction is kind of,

478
00:35:13.64 --> 00:35:14.48
what do you wait?

479
00:35:14.48 --> 00:35:15.32
Why are we stopping?

480
00:35:15.32 --> 00:35:16.92
We've actually got some momentum right now.

481
00:35:16.92 --> 00:35:20.72
And then he finds out that from the big picture,

482
00:35:20.72 --> 00:35:22.52
the reason you're not attacking is because you're too far

483
00:35:22.52 --> 00:35:24.36
out ahead of everyone, if you get going further,

484
00:35:24.36 --> 00:35:26.24
you might get surrounded and cut off.

485
00:35:26.24 --> 00:35:31.24
Now, this is a situation where understanding why?

486
00:35:32.60 --> 00:35:34.56
Why is so helpful?

487
00:35:34.56 --> 00:35:37.52
And especially if you push that all the way down

488
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:40.64
to the front line troops and to the front line leadership,

489
00:35:40.64 --> 00:35:41.96
that's out there thinking, hey,

490
00:35:41.96 --> 00:35:45.08
we finally made some offensive progress

491
00:35:45.08 --> 00:35:49.20
and we can move and we can really take it to the enemy.

492
00:35:49.20 --> 00:35:50.32
And now you're telling us to stop,

493
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:51.40
what is going on?

494
00:35:51.40 --> 00:35:53.84
The headquarters is stupid, they don't get it,

495
00:35:53.84 --> 00:35:54.84
they don't understand.

496
00:35:54.84 --> 00:35:56.56
Actually, they do understand,

497
00:35:56.56 --> 00:35:58.48
but they need to do a better job of explaining why,

498
00:35:58.48 --> 00:35:59.96
so that the people know.

499
00:35:59.96 --> 00:36:09.96
All right, moving on to this next section.

500
00:36:09.96 --> 00:36:14.36
Here he's checking out his line,

501
00:36:14.36 --> 00:36:16.28
now that they're dug in a little bit,

502
00:36:16.28 --> 00:36:17.64
he'd gone to Regiment.

503
00:36:18.84 --> 00:36:20.64
It's really easy to forget that these guys,

504
00:36:20.64 --> 00:36:21.72
and I talk about this a bit,

505
00:36:21.72 --> 00:36:25.24
but the best type of communications that they have

506
00:36:25.24 --> 00:36:27.000
is when they actually run wires

507
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.28
between different between regiment,

508
00:36:29.28 --> 00:36:31.16
between battalions, between the companies,

509
00:36:31.16 --> 00:36:34.40
they try and run wires because the radio is our

510
00:36:34.40 --> 00:36:37.68
fairly temperamental on whether they work or not.

511
00:36:37.68 --> 00:36:38.84
So they use radio as a backup,

512
00:36:38.84 --> 00:36:42.56
but the primary communication is running a wire,

513
00:36:42.56 --> 00:36:46.04
and he had just gone back to Regiment to meet face to face,

514
00:36:46.04 --> 00:36:48.76
because meeting face to face is very important.

515
00:36:48.76 --> 00:36:53.84
And he just comes back up and he asks one of the company

516
00:36:53.84 --> 00:36:56.76
to commit, actually I think it was his ops officer,

517
00:36:56.76 --> 00:37:00.92
Newcome, he says, hey, any news,

518
00:37:01.92 --> 00:37:03.60
and Newcome, his ops officer says,

519
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:05.60
nope, everything's quiet as a church.

520
00:37:05.60 --> 00:37:07.84
The S3 looks at the battalion commander

521
00:37:07.84 --> 00:37:10.20
in the Starlight and Grind as he went on.

522
00:37:10.20 --> 00:37:12.20
Now major, you don't have to concern yourself

523
00:37:12.20 --> 00:37:13.68
with everything up here.

524
00:37:13.68 --> 00:37:15.64
You just leave the details to us,

525
00:37:15.64 --> 00:37:17.48
where you used to looking after them.

526
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:19.60
So a little bit of decentralized command,

527
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:20.88
don't worry about a boss.

528
00:37:20.88 --> 00:37:22.80
We got this, we're gonna be all right.

529
00:37:22.80 --> 00:37:26.72
Now next day rolls around, and here we go,

530
00:37:26.72 --> 00:37:28.64
back to the book around 1000,

531
00:37:28.64 --> 00:37:30.52
the Germans sheld the battalion heavily,

532
00:37:30.52 --> 00:37:32.76
but they didn't follow up.

533
00:37:32.76 --> 00:37:34.28
Follow this up with an attack.

534
00:37:34.28 --> 00:37:36.88
By 1100, the wounded had all been evacuated,

535
00:37:36.88 --> 00:37:39.72
and the wire lines had been relayed to the Regiment.

536
00:37:40.80 --> 00:37:42.60
The major instructed Grimzel

537
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:44.72
to collect all five company commanders

538
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:46.08
and meet him as soon as possible

539
00:37:46.08 --> 00:37:47.88
at the crossroads of the edge of the woods

540
00:37:47.88 --> 00:37:49.80
from which they had first attacked.

541
00:37:49.80 --> 00:37:53.24
It was only a little way from the Regimental command post

542
00:37:53.24 --> 00:37:55.28
to the edge of the woods.

543
00:37:55.28 --> 00:37:58.04
He got there well before the others.

544
00:37:58.04 --> 00:38:00.24
When they came up a few minutes later,

545
00:38:00.24 --> 00:38:04.20
he missed Newcomb before he caught the meaning

546
00:38:04.20 --> 00:38:05.88
of their odd manner.

547
00:38:05.88 --> 00:38:09.16
Grimzel's set face should have given him a hint

548
00:38:09.16 --> 00:38:12.64
as the S2 step forward, saluted very stiffly

549
00:38:12.64 --> 00:38:15.92
and said with visible effort to keep his emotions under control,

550
00:38:15.92 --> 00:38:20.40
Sir, I must report that Captain Newcomb is dead.

551
00:38:20.40 --> 00:38:22.64
The others look silently at the ground

552
00:38:22.64 --> 00:38:27.24
and tears begin to stream down the gentle Grimzel's face.

553
00:38:27.24 --> 00:38:32.68
The news struck the major with the force of a physical blow.

554
00:38:32.68 --> 00:38:37.12
Of all the fine men, he had met since taken command

555
00:38:37.12 --> 00:38:40.72
of the battalion, Newcomb had been one of the very best.

556
00:38:40.72 --> 00:38:43.44
He was quick, willing, and intelligent.

557
00:38:43.44 --> 00:38:47.08
Wise far beyond his 24, 25 years.

558
00:38:47.08 --> 00:38:51.000
He also stared at the ground for a moment

559
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.40
and then asked quietly how did it happen?

560
00:38:53.40 --> 00:38:58.56
Ryan spoke up, same sniper, same place as the dock.

561
00:38:58.56 --> 00:39:01.48
So a dock had been killed earlier by a sniper.

562
00:39:01.48 --> 00:39:04.64
One of my men wore a nuke to stay out of that gap

563
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:07.80
in the headrow, but he took the steel part of his helmet off

564
00:39:07.80 --> 00:39:10.68
and sat down on it right square in the gap itself.

565
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:13.88
The sergeant who thought the captain must have gone nuts all

566
00:39:13.88 --> 00:39:19.20
of a sudden was coming after him to drag him away, but too late.

567
00:39:19.20 --> 00:39:22.40
The sniper got him right in the temple.

568
00:39:22.40 --> 00:39:27.52
John's felt numb inside, but to dwell on his sorrow

569
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:29.32
wouldn't help.

570
00:39:29.32 --> 00:39:33.52
Notting solemnly, he leveled his finger at Captain Weddle.

571
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:36.92
You are now a legoon red-three, but you will retain command

572
00:39:36.92 --> 00:39:40.56
of your company until we complete the move into these woods.

573
00:39:40.56 --> 00:39:44.36
Weddle equally grave, replied, yes sir.

574
00:39:44.36 --> 00:39:45.72
I have a little news too.

575
00:39:45.72 --> 00:39:48.80
Lieutenant Chadwick got half his helmet knocked off by a burp gun

576
00:39:48.80 --> 00:39:51.12
during all that shooting a while ago.

577
00:39:51.12 --> 00:39:54.84
He caught either a part of his helmet or some of the slugs in his arm.

578
00:39:54.84 --> 00:39:56.88
He's out, but he isn't hurt badly.

579
00:39:56.88 --> 00:39:58.92
He'll be back.

580
00:39:58.92 --> 00:40:03.28
Major John's who'd never met Chadwick merely not again.

581
00:40:03.28 --> 00:40:06.48
It didn't hurt so much when you didn't know the man.

582
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:10.56
Furthermore, a wound regardless of its severity,

583
00:40:10.56 --> 00:40:14.36
lacked the awful finality of death.

584
00:40:14.36 --> 00:40:17.60
Chadwick's temporary loss meant one less officer

585
00:40:17.60 --> 00:40:22.56
when as new comes death left a hole in his heart.

586
00:40:22.56 --> 00:40:26.04
Although he knew Weddle would probably be a good S3-2

587
00:40:26.04 --> 00:40:29.12
new come in the foreshore days he had known him

588
00:40:29.12 --> 00:40:32.04
had become a friend.

589
00:40:32.04 --> 00:40:35.44
Grimso had moved a little away from the others.

590
00:40:35.44 --> 00:40:38.92
He was leaning against a tree, his head down in the curve of his arms,

591
00:40:38.92 --> 00:40:41.92
sob's shaking his body.

592
00:40:41.92 --> 00:40:46.16
He and newcomed become close friends for years

593
00:40:46.16 --> 00:40:48.64
and had worked together daily.

594
00:40:48.64 --> 00:40:53.44
The major spoke to Captain Menzer, the headquarters company commander,

595
00:40:53.44 --> 00:40:57.04
see the lieutenant Grimso was pulled off somewhere,

596
00:40:57.04 --> 00:41:01.12
where it's quiet and given a chance to lie down and get some rest.

597
00:41:01.12 --> 00:41:03.44
If he objects tell him it's an order,

598
00:41:03.44 --> 00:41:06.52
I don't want to see him around anymore today.

599
00:41:06.52 --> 00:41:10.60
Menzer, small and dapper, saluted sharply.

600
00:41:10.60 --> 00:41:11.96
Yes, sir.

601
00:41:11.96 --> 00:41:13.48
I'll look after George Allwright.

602
00:41:19.48 --> 00:41:21.48
These guys are taking casualties

603
00:41:21.48 --> 00:41:25.40
at just an incredible amount.

604
00:41:25.40 --> 00:41:29.20
And you see a couple of things in here

605
00:41:29.20 --> 00:41:32.000
that we've heard before.

606
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.52
You see the major realizing that Grimso is done.

607
00:41:37.52 --> 00:41:38.96
He needs to break.

608
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:42.28
And he says, get him off the line,

609
00:41:42.28 --> 00:41:45.40
get him somewhere you can take a break.

610
00:41:45.40 --> 00:41:50.36
And you also see these guys filling billets

611
00:41:50.36 --> 00:41:53.24
and just getting promoted, battle field promoted.

612
00:41:53.24 --> 00:41:55.68
The guy was one of the company commanders,

613
00:41:55.68 --> 00:42:00.52
weddle, he becomes the operations officer boom on the spot.

614
00:42:00.52 --> 00:42:10.68
It's really, you can see why this book is one hack

615
00:42:10.68 --> 00:42:14.16
where it's favorite books.

616
00:42:14.16 --> 00:42:17.64
So now they're, they're hold up for a while.

617
00:42:17.64 --> 00:42:18.92
And here we go back to the book.

618
00:42:18.92 --> 00:42:23.48
10 days drag by while the battalion sat in Boyd to Breddle.

619
00:42:23.48 --> 00:42:24.96
If the days were sometimes dull,

620
00:42:24.96 --> 00:42:26.64
they were rarely unaventful.

621
00:42:26.64 --> 00:42:29.08
Men were wounded or killed nearly every day

622
00:42:29.08 --> 00:42:32.60
by artillery, mortars, or the fire from self-proped,

623
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:35.36
propelled 808s that could move unseen

624
00:42:35.36 --> 00:42:37.56
into positions from which they could fire into the tops

625
00:42:37.56 --> 00:42:41.08
of trees of the bla, and then pull back

626
00:42:41.08 --> 00:42:45.16
before the artillery men could bring fire on them.

627
00:42:45.16 --> 00:42:47.08
Those casualties were bad enough,

628
00:42:47.08 --> 00:42:49.76
but they were to be expected.

629
00:42:49.76 --> 00:42:52.04
There was one incident that the battalion commander thought

630
00:42:52.04 --> 00:42:56.000
they could have got along very nicely without.

631
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.16
Regiment and directed that.

632
00:42:57.16 --> 00:43:00.28
The battalion's erect barbed wire along their whole front,

633
00:43:00.28 --> 00:43:02.68
which they did cheerfully.

634
00:43:02.68 --> 00:43:04.92
But when a truckload of anti-personnel mines

635
00:43:04.92 --> 00:43:08.92
came down, the major looked at them with misgivings.

636
00:43:08.92 --> 00:43:11.56
Those things were as dangerous to the people who laid them

637
00:43:11.56 --> 00:43:15.40
as they were to the enemy, he thought.

638
00:43:15.40 --> 00:43:17.84
So he supervised the mind-lane carefully,

639
00:43:17.84 --> 00:43:20.20
meticulously noting the location of each mine

640
00:43:20.20 --> 00:43:24.80
on a large scale sketch of the area being mined.

641
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:26.80
The day after all the mines were laid,

642
00:43:26.80 --> 00:43:31.28
he heard the flat mulfled roar of a landmine.

643
00:43:31.28 --> 00:43:33.88
At once he ran toward the sound,

644
00:43:33.88 --> 00:43:37.48
he got there with the aid men to watch with sorrow and anger

645
00:43:37.48 --> 00:43:39.88
while they evacuated three men

646
00:43:39.88 --> 00:43:42.64
from the middle of their own minefield.

647
00:43:42.64 --> 00:43:44.80
One of them was dead.

648
00:43:44.80 --> 00:43:48.36
The last litter carried Iperian, who badly hit

649
00:43:48.36 --> 00:43:50.56
in the legs with several fragments,

650
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:53.000
did not know how severely he was hurt.

651
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.16
The other wounded men unconscious was being placed

652
00:43:57.16 --> 00:43:58.000
on the medical Jeep,

653
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and still another litter came around the corner

654
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.56
of the little farmhouse that stood on the edge of the woods.

655
00:44:03.56 --> 00:44:06.80
The man on this litter had his eyes closed,

656
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:08.80
his face twisting horribly.

657
00:44:08.80 --> 00:44:12.24
He jerked over, he jerked all over,

658
00:44:12.24 --> 00:44:14.52
bringing his legs up so hard the aid men

659
00:44:14.52 --> 00:44:16.08
had to hold him down on the litter.

660
00:44:16.08 --> 00:44:19.72
The major, looking at the man in wonder,

661
00:44:19.72 --> 00:44:21.68
asked, what's the matter with him?

662
00:44:21.68 --> 00:44:25.12
The aid men were contemptuous.

663
00:44:25.12 --> 00:44:30.12
Ah, said one, this guy never got hit by nothing.

664
00:44:30.12 --> 00:44:32.52
He was in a whole 50 yards from where it happened,

665
00:44:32.52 --> 00:44:34.56
but he started screaming and yelling and carrying

666
00:44:34.56 --> 00:44:36.40
on something awful.

667
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:39.56
We thought he was hit, but he ain't got a whole in him.

668
00:44:39.56 --> 00:44:41.20
He was like this when we got to him.

669
00:44:42.56 --> 00:44:46.000
John's realized he had just seen his first case

670
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.80
of neuropsychosis commonly called combat exhaustion

671
00:44:50.80 --> 00:44:52.000
or CE.

672
00:44:53.12 --> 00:44:55.80
It wasn't the only one he was to see.

673
00:45:00.96 --> 00:45:02.60
So you got,

674
00:45:02.60 --> 00:45:05.96
for me, why I guess that's that friendly fire?

675
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:09.24
That's friendly fire when you hit one of your own landmines,

676
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.28
nightmare.

677
00:45:14.64 --> 00:45:15.32
Now,

678
00:45:17.16 --> 00:45:20.72
and also, you start seeing some psychological

679
00:45:20.72 --> 00:45:23.48
damage to guys on the front line.

680
00:45:23.48 --> 00:45:26.24
And that guy's not gonna be any good.

681
00:45:26.24 --> 00:45:27.16
He can't fight.

682
00:45:27.16 --> 00:45:30.24
He's literally screaming and jerking around.

683
00:45:30.24 --> 00:45:31.64
They have to hold him down.

684
00:45:37.20 --> 00:45:39.84
All right, now the battalion is gonna move

685
00:45:39.84 --> 00:45:43.16
and take over a whole area.

686
00:45:44.84 --> 00:45:46.32
From the third arm of division,

687
00:45:46.32 --> 00:45:48.12
and it's moving into this area,

688
00:45:48.12 --> 00:45:50.96
it's got 300 replacements coming in.

689
00:45:50.96 --> 00:45:52.12
So think about that.

690
00:45:52.12 --> 00:45:54.20
Battalion supposed to be 900 people

691
00:45:54.20 --> 00:45:56.28
and they're getting 300 replacements.

692
00:45:56.28 --> 00:45:57.76
So that tells you,

693
00:45:57.76 --> 00:46:00.44
and again, I am breezing, I'm skipping,

694
00:46:00.44 --> 00:46:01.76
I'm not even breezing, I'm not breezing through,

695
00:46:01.76 --> 00:46:05.000
I'm skipping so much of the fighting and combat

696
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.48
in this book, but it's just going on continuously.

697
00:46:09.52 --> 00:46:11.04
And at this point, they're going in,

698
00:46:11.04 --> 00:46:13.88
they already have 300 replacements.

699
00:46:13.88 --> 00:46:18.88
So they've had 300 people taken out

700
00:46:18.44 --> 00:46:20.56
or either either wounded or killed.

701
00:46:22.20 --> 00:46:26.04
So at this point, Lieutenant Ryan's company

702
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:31.04
is on a patrol and they're gonna go set up an outpost

703
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:36.16
into some pretty rough area.

704
00:46:37.12 --> 00:46:40.08
And as the patrols out there, here we go,

705
00:46:40.08 --> 00:46:42.60
then came the first shots from the patrol.

706
00:46:42.60 --> 00:46:45.20
They were going in well, and it looked for a few seconds

707
00:46:45.20 --> 00:46:47.96
as if Ryan was gonna get to his outpost.

708
00:46:47.96 --> 00:46:50.56
But a flare of three red star clusters floated up

709
00:46:50.56 --> 00:46:54.16
from the German lines and all hell broke loose again.

710
00:46:55.16 --> 00:46:58.84
Every crowd gun that had been used to help stop the third

711
00:46:58.84 --> 00:47:01.68
armored plus probably a few that had come in late

712
00:47:01.68 --> 00:47:06.68
opened up on about 150 yards of the Abel company front.

713
00:47:07.16 --> 00:47:10.28
It was concentrated, thunderous, murder,

714
00:47:10.28 --> 00:47:13.60
such as no one in the battalion had ever seen before.

715
00:47:14.68 --> 00:47:18.84
Ryan's line was a mass of seething, leaping flame

716
00:47:18.84 --> 00:47:21.28
that looked as if it were fed from below,

717
00:47:21.28 --> 00:47:25.12
rather than from an inconceivable torrent of shells

718
00:47:25.12 --> 00:47:28.04
that came on and on and on.

719
00:47:30.44 --> 00:47:32.96
The brush switched suddenly from the company

720
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:35.84
to the battalion, command post area itself.

721
00:47:35.84 --> 00:47:37.60
The battalion commander in his staff

722
00:47:37.60 --> 00:47:39.36
hearing the first wine of the shells

723
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:41.52
dived for the new command post hall

724
00:47:41.52 --> 00:47:44.28
where they huddled while the walls shuddered

725
00:47:44.28 --> 00:47:46.40
and dirt rained down from the roof.

726
00:47:47.44 --> 00:47:51.08
Conclusion blew out the candles, but nobody was hurt.

727
00:47:51.88 --> 00:47:55.96
The German gunners switched to seet company for a few rounds.

728
00:47:55.96 --> 00:48:00.16
Then right went right back to their prime target, Abel company.

729
00:48:01.16 --> 00:48:03.32
While they were pounding Kenny's company,

730
00:48:03.32 --> 00:48:08.12
a single short call came in over the 300, which is their radio.

731
00:48:08.12 --> 00:48:09.60
Abel six is clipped.

732
00:48:10.52 --> 00:48:13.72
That meant Ryan had been hit, but there were no details.

733
00:48:14.92 --> 00:48:17.16
20 minutes after that pretty red star cluster

734
00:48:17.16 --> 00:48:19.08
went up, all was quiet again,

735
00:48:19.08 --> 00:48:21.56
except for some moans and cries for medics

736
00:48:21.56 --> 00:48:23.56
that floated back from Abel company.

737
00:48:24.44 --> 00:48:27.44
But at least no Germany infantry had come in under fire.

738
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:31.64
In the 20, in that 20 minutes,

739
00:48:31.64 --> 00:48:35.92
the company lost 54 men, plus its company commander.

740
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:39.000
Almost every man in the patrol had been caught above ground

741
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.72
and was killed or wounded, while most of the other casualties

742
00:48:41.72 --> 00:48:44.08
came from tree and hedgerow bursts

743
00:48:44.08 --> 00:48:46.52
that sent fragments down into the holes.

744
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.44
The men of the command post group gathered around the hole

745
00:48:51.44 --> 00:48:53.92
silently watched the parade of walking wounded

746
00:48:53.92 --> 00:48:57.12
that filed slowly by on the way to the aid station.

747
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.32
Occasionally, a man would stumble or waver

748
00:49:01.32 --> 00:49:05.52
where upon a messenger or wire man would jump to help him.

749
00:49:05.52 --> 00:49:07.88
Every aid man and litter in the battalion

750
00:49:07.88 --> 00:49:09.60
was already up at the Abel line,

751
00:49:09.60 --> 00:49:13.000
and the first litters were not far behind the walking wounded.

752
00:49:14.16 --> 00:49:17.56
Some of the victims moaned and a few cried out,

753
00:49:17.56 --> 00:49:22.20
a little now and then, but most were very quiet.

754
00:49:24.04 --> 00:49:27.04
John's was glad he could not see their faces in the dark.

755
00:49:28.84 --> 00:49:32.24
The last litter went by with no word from Ryan.

756
00:49:32.24 --> 00:49:35.68
John's was beginning to hope he hadn't been hurt badly.

757
00:49:35.68 --> 00:49:37.88
When four men loomed out of the darkness,

758
00:49:37.88 --> 00:49:41.04
each carrying a corner of a blanket.

759
00:49:41.04 --> 00:49:44.48
Ryan was half sitting, half lying in the makeshift litter,

760
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:48.64
gritting his teeth at the pain of the wounds in an arm and a leg.

761
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.96
They laid the blanket down gently in front of the major

762
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:56.52
who stripped off his coat and laid it over the company commander.

763
00:49:57.92 --> 00:50:00.28
Ryan managed to work up a feeble grin.

764
00:50:00.28 --> 00:50:04.36
It didn't work too good, did it boss.

765
00:50:15.24 --> 00:50:16.60
That's...

766
00:50:20.60 --> 00:50:24.80
When you're the battalion commander and you come up on the plan

767
00:50:24.80 --> 00:50:27.80
with a company commander and you think you've got everything right.

768
00:50:27.80 --> 00:50:32.80
And you lose 54 guys in the company in 20 minutes.

769
00:50:36.64 --> 00:50:39.48
And your company commander comes back

770
00:50:39.48 --> 00:50:42.32
and says it didn't go too good, did it boss.

771
00:50:42.32 --> 00:50:43.32
To have you wait.

772
00:50:47.88 --> 00:50:50.80
Now, they do end up pushing forward,

773
00:50:50.80 --> 00:50:55.80
they get some ground and he's out checking and you're gonna,

774
00:50:55.80 --> 00:50:58.80
you're gonna find this out and he talks about it.

775
00:50:58.80 --> 00:51:01.80
But he goes forward to find out what's going on

776
00:51:01.80 --> 00:51:02.80
and make sure the guy's seeing.

777
00:51:02.80 --> 00:51:06.80
And at one point he's checking and out post a little out post

778
00:51:06.80 --> 00:51:08.80
where they're guarding this certain area.

779
00:51:08.80 --> 00:51:12.80
And all the guys in the group are focused on a tank

780
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:14.80
on an old burned out tank.

781
00:51:14.80 --> 00:51:16.80
That's out there in front of them.

782
00:51:16.80 --> 00:51:19.80
And he comes up to them and here we go back to the book.

783
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:21.80
John's pointed to the corner.

784
00:51:21.80 --> 00:51:23.80
Does it take all three of you to watch that tank

785
00:51:23.80 --> 00:51:26.80
while the whole German army could crawl up to within 10 feet

786
00:51:26.80 --> 00:51:28.80
of you without knowing it?

787
00:51:30.80 --> 00:51:31.80
The sergeants mouth dropped open.

788
00:51:31.80 --> 00:51:34.80
God made you, I never even thought about it.

789
00:51:34.80 --> 00:51:37.80
After they shot at us from the tank last time.

790
00:51:37.80 --> 00:51:42.80
Well, you better damn straight start thinking about your flanks

791
00:51:42.80 --> 00:51:47.80
if you want it, if you want to end up being able to think at all.

792
00:51:47.80 --> 00:51:50.80
I wouldn't give a damn if they knocked all three

793
00:51:50.80 --> 00:51:53.80
you stupid bastards out.

794
00:51:53.80 --> 00:51:57.80
But if they got you, they'd have a good chance of getting into the middle of your company.

795
00:51:57.80 --> 00:51:59.80
And I wouldn't like that.

796
00:51:59.80 --> 00:52:03.80
Now damn you start thinking.

797
00:52:05.80 --> 00:52:07.80
Again, you know what?

798
00:52:07.80 --> 00:52:08.80
He's detached.

799
00:52:08.80 --> 00:52:11.80
Those guys just got shot at from those tanks.

800
00:52:11.80 --> 00:52:13.80
They're not worried about their flank.

801
00:52:13.80 --> 00:52:14.80
They're worried about that tank.

802
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:15.80
Another sniper being in another machine gun

803
00:52:15.80 --> 00:52:17.80
or sneaking up into it.

804
00:52:17.80 --> 00:52:18.80
So he's detached.

805
00:52:18.80 --> 00:52:22.80
He rolls up and sees, hey, I see that you're focused on the tank,

806
00:52:22.80 --> 00:52:24.80
but you can't, you've got to keep thinking.

807
00:52:28.80 --> 00:52:30.80
Going back to the book orders came down during the night

808
00:52:30.80 --> 00:52:33.80
directing Lagoon Red, Major John's first patowning

809
00:52:33.80 --> 00:52:35.80
of the 115th Infantry Regiment,

810
00:52:35.80 --> 00:52:39.80
would relieve lemon red by midnight of the following day.

811
00:52:39.80 --> 00:52:42.80
Lemon was codenamed for the 116th,

812
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:45.80
whose red first patowning was holding the line

813
00:52:45.80 --> 00:52:50.80
to the left of where Lagoon Red had hopped off nearly three weeks before.

814
00:52:50.80 --> 00:52:54.80
So they're going up to relieve and hold the line.

815
00:52:54.80 --> 00:52:58.80
They're going up to take positions and hold them.

816
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:01.80
Meeting the commander of this group,

817
00:53:01.80 --> 00:53:04.80
they're taking the place of back to the book,

818
00:53:04.80 --> 00:53:06.80
the big commander introducing himself,

819
00:53:06.80 --> 00:53:07.80
shook hands all around.

820
00:53:07.80 --> 00:53:10.80
They need to take a deep breath and started in

821
00:53:10.80 --> 00:53:12.80
on a careful detail briefing.

822
00:53:12.80 --> 00:53:15.80
He said, this is a hot spot.

823
00:53:15.80 --> 00:53:18.80
I know you've all been in hot lots of them before,

824
00:53:18.80 --> 00:53:20.80
but please take my word for it.

825
00:53:20.80 --> 00:53:22.80
This one is really hot.

826
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:25.80
He paused and looked at the officers as if to make sure

827
00:53:25.80 --> 00:53:27.80
they were going to take his word for it.

828
00:53:27.80 --> 00:53:28.80
Then he went on.

829
00:53:28.80 --> 00:53:31.80
We've got Nazi paratroopers on the other side of the headdroes.

830
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:34.80
They're the best that Hitler has and they know it.

831
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:37.80
They don't give us much rest.

832
00:53:37.80 --> 00:53:43.80
We don't give them any.

833
00:53:43.80 --> 00:53:45.80
We have casualties every day,

834
00:53:45.80 --> 00:53:48.80
so please do your best not to cause any more than we have

835
00:53:48.80 --> 00:53:51.80
to take anyway.

836
00:53:51.80 --> 00:53:54.80
My boys have been here for two weeks now

837
00:53:54.80 --> 00:53:56.80
and they're getting right touchy.

838
00:53:56.80 --> 00:54:00.80
So if any of you get snapped at, don't pay attention to it.

839
00:54:00.80 --> 00:54:03.80
Just go on and they'll get over it.

840
00:54:03.80 --> 00:54:10.80
So this guy's guys are pretty burn out at this point.

841
00:54:10.80 --> 00:54:15.80
And they do this turnover.

842
00:54:15.80 --> 00:54:18.80
And he goes out and again, the turnover happens.

843
00:54:18.80 --> 00:54:19.80
There's more combat.

844
00:54:19.80 --> 00:54:22.80
There's more casualties.

845
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:24.80
And then he's going out.

846
00:54:24.80 --> 00:54:26.80
But they'd think settled down and he's going out.

847
00:54:26.80 --> 00:54:27.80
They check the line.

848
00:54:27.80 --> 00:54:28.80
And here we go back to the book.

849
00:54:28.80 --> 00:54:32.80
As usual, Major John asks a number of men how they were getting along.

850
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:34.80
He got a warning answer that surprised him.

851
00:54:34.80 --> 00:54:36.80
A sergeant said, well sir, everything's okay.

852
00:54:36.80 --> 00:54:38.80
It's a tough spot, but I figure where his good is any other out.

853
00:54:38.80 --> 00:54:41.80
Fit to hold it down and somebody's got to do it.

854
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:45.80
But I sure wish the Major would get around and see us more often.

855
00:54:45.80 --> 00:54:48.80
Does the men a world of good to see you down here in the lines?

856
00:54:48.80 --> 00:54:52.80
The Major who had fought he was getting around about as often as any

857
00:54:52.80 --> 00:54:57.80
batained commander should was seriously concerned because this sergeant didn't seem to think so.

858
00:54:57.80 --> 00:54:59.80
Instead of being annoyed,

859
00:54:59.80 --> 00:55:03.80
he was pleased that the men had the uncommon guts to say what he thought,

860
00:55:03.80 --> 00:55:05.80
whether or not he was right.

861
00:55:05.80 --> 00:55:06.80
So there you go.

862
00:55:06.80 --> 00:55:07.80
But that ain't commander.

863
00:55:07.80 --> 00:55:12.80
Instead of getting all mad, this sergeant says something, he's actually thankful.

864
00:55:12.80 --> 00:55:17.80
He answered, okay, serge, you'll see me around a lot more in the future.

865
00:55:17.80 --> 00:55:21.80
The sergeant salute Charlie, where upon stone, this is a new company commander.

866
00:55:21.80 --> 00:55:23.80
Stone and the Major went on.

867
00:55:23.80 --> 00:55:26.80
Stone trying to stammer out an apology for the brash sergeant.

868
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:35.80
John's cut him off, but not before Stone had volunteered the statement that he himself thought the Major got around more than any other batained commander he'd ever seen.

869
00:55:35.80 --> 00:55:40.80
The fact that Stone had not seen many batained commanders did not escape John's,

870
00:55:40.80 --> 00:55:46.80
whose smile to himself as the company commander lapsed into an embarrassed silence.

871
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:49.80
On the way back to battalion,

872
00:55:49.80 --> 00:55:52.80
you reviewed his own approach to the problem of leadership.

873
00:55:52.80 --> 00:55:57.80
He knew that he must prove himself, especially his courage to every man in the outfit,

874
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:01.80
if he expected to get the maximum from them.

875
00:56:01.80 --> 00:56:07.80
He felt that he had done so fairly effectively as far as sea company was concerned,

876
00:56:07.80 --> 00:56:13.80
because he stayed with them that night for the counterattack that had threatened their left flank.

877
00:56:13.80 --> 00:56:21.80
Also, his personal intelligence service told him that a company had approved the little battle he and Grimsel and Martin had had with the machine.

878
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:25.80
He had a machine gun that had killed Jimmy and Sadler.

879
00:56:25.80 --> 00:56:29.80
So he's got his personal intelligence service.

880
00:56:29.80 --> 00:56:31.80
I've talked about this before.

881
00:56:31.80 --> 00:56:33.80
You got your own guys that are telling you what's going on.

882
00:56:33.80 --> 00:56:37.80
His own little guys had told them that a company,

883
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:38.80
they respected him.

884
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:41.80
They knew he was going to get after it.

885
00:56:41.80 --> 00:56:45.80
Back to the book, but it was apparent that this is going to be a company by company proposition.

886
00:56:45.80 --> 00:56:48.80
Baker company didn't seem to be impressed.

887
00:56:48.80 --> 00:56:55.80
He'd have to do something about that.

888
00:56:55.80 --> 00:56:59.80
Now, this is just another thing about leadership.

889
00:56:59.80 --> 00:57:04.80
He's on a field phone, and again, I talked about how they put these wires in, and he's on a field phone.

890
00:57:04.80 --> 00:57:08.80
And he gets done making something happen on the field phone,

891
00:57:08.80 --> 00:57:10.80
and puts down the phone on the table.

892
00:57:10.80 --> 00:57:13.80
The phone rang before anyone could say anything.

893
00:57:13.80 --> 00:57:15.80
John's picked it up barking red six.

894
00:57:15.80 --> 00:57:16.80
That's his call sign.

895
00:57:16.80 --> 00:57:18.80
The operators' voice came through clearly.

896
00:57:18.80 --> 00:57:20.80
Are you finished?

897
00:57:20.80 --> 00:57:21.80
Yes, I am.

898
00:57:21.80 --> 00:57:23.80
He slammed it back on the table.

899
00:57:23.80 --> 00:57:24.80
Weddle shook his head.

900
00:57:24.80 --> 00:57:26.80
You forgot to ring off, Major.

901
00:57:26.80 --> 00:57:29.80
Sergeant Wilson gives the operators hell if they don't make sure the lines are clear.

902
00:57:29.80 --> 00:57:32.80
Sergeant Wilson was the acting communications officer.

903
00:57:32.80 --> 00:57:35.80
The original man had been killed, and Wilson was doing a fine job.

904
00:57:35.80 --> 00:57:37.80
He'd been in for a commission for quite a while.

905
00:57:37.80 --> 00:57:41.80
John's picked up the phone and twisted the crank on the leather case.

906
00:57:41.80 --> 00:57:43.80
The operator answered instantly.

907
00:57:43.80 --> 00:57:44.80
Yes, sir?

908
00:57:44.80 --> 00:57:46.80
What's your name, operator?

909
00:57:46.80 --> 00:57:48.80
Private Henderson, sir.

910
00:57:48.80 --> 00:57:50.80
The voice was a little uncertain.

911
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:52.80
Okay, private Henderson.

912
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:54.80
You keep doing your job the way you're supposed to.

913
00:57:54.80 --> 00:57:56.80
Don't mind me if I snap at you once and a while.

914
00:57:56.80 --> 00:57:57.80
I'm sorry.

915
00:57:57.80 --> 00:57:59.80
He finished.

916
00:57:59.80 --> 00:58:01.80
He started to lay the phone down.

917
00:58:01.80 --> 00:58:03.80
Smiled, picked it up, and added.

918
00:58:03.80 --> 00:58:04.80
Finished.

919
00:58:04.80 --> 00:58:14.76
So again, you can see he's a guy that doesn't get all crazy when, you know, when people come to him and say, hey, you're supposed to be

920
00:58:14.76 --> 00:58:15.76
fine off the line.

921
00:58:15.76 --> 00:58:16.76
I got to keep these lines open.

922
00:58:16.76 --> 00:58:17.76
You're not sign off the line.

923
00:58:17.76 --> 00:58:19.76
Are you done?

924
00:58:19.76 --> 00:58:23.76
You see ego maniac leaders do that.

925
00:58:23.76 --> 00:58:25.76
Get crazy on stupid stuff.

926
00:58:25.76 --> 00:58:31.76
They're not following their own rules.

927
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:34.76
Now talking about this network, talking about these communications.

928
00:58:34.76 --> 00:58:35.76
Here we go back to the book.

929
00:58:35.76 --> 00:58:43.76
This network of communications enabled three men to keep accurate minute by minute track of all that was going over on the entire front, covered by nearly 600 men.

930
00:58:43.76 --> 00:58:51.76
From this one spot, they could direct the lives of all those men, actors in the most thrilling and awful drama of all time.

931
00:58:51.76 --> 00:59:02.76
So the way that they're doing this, and I should have explained this earlier, is you have the battalion commander and he has a small staff of people that stay with him most of the time.

932
00:59:02.76 --> 00:59:07.76
His operations officer, his communications officer, his intelligence officer.

933
00:59:07.76 --> 00:59:12.76
And what they do is when they get to certain positions, they find a command post, a CP.

934
00:59:12.76 --> 00:59:17.76
And when they're in the field, what they do is they dig a big giant foxhole.

935
00:59:17.76 --> 00:59:19.76
And they make it as good as they can.

936
00:59:19.76 --> 00:59:21.76
They put logs over the top of it.

937
00:59:21.76 --> 00:59:23.76
They put dirt on top of that or sandbags or something.

938
00:59:23.76 --> 00:59:29.76
So they're pretty, they're trying to get pretty secure in there from overhead artillery attacks.

939
00:59:29.76 --> 00:59:39.76
And then they run wires out to set up communications with all these, all the company commanders who have their own little command posts.

940
00:59:39.76 --> 00:59:46.76
And obviously this thing isn't permanent because it has to be mobile because tomorrow night, the next night we might move another thousand yards or 500 yards.

941
00:59:46.76 --> 00:59:52.76
And then that foxhole that we'd dug isn't doing us any good anymore.

942
00:59:52.76 --> 00:59:58.76
But from this little command post that they set up, they're running this whole show.

943
00:59:58.76 --> 01:00:00.76
Now he talks about his decision making here.

944
01:00:00.76 --> 01:00:05.76
Back to the book, if he made a wrong decision, he could cause men to lose their lives needlessly.

945
01:00:05.76 --> 01:00:15.76
Or if he was clever or lucky, he might by moving a single squatter, puttune or calling for fire support, defeat the enemy and gain additional glory for the unit.

946
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:22.76
All without moving from his communications when in a defensive position such as this.

947
01:00:22.76 --> 01:00:26.76
Then he's talking here about like some of that drama that happens.

948
01:00:26.76 --> 01:00:32.76
Back to the book, a single rifle shot could mean the death of a company commander or it could mean nothing.

949
01:00:32.76 --> 01:00:43.76
A mortar round might wipe out an outpost and lay a company open to a surprise attack or it might only kick up a little dust and scar a few trees.

950
01:00:43.76 --> 01:00:52.76
A volley of artillery fire could come through the roof over their heads or it could burst harmlessly in the fields outside.

951
01:00:52.76 --> 01:00:59.76
A burst of fire from the orchard could mean another pig, because they had killed some pigs that they fought with enemy.

952
01:00:59.76 --> 01:01:03.76
Or a full-scale German attack.

953
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:08.76
Each sound built up a certain amount of suspense to greater or lesser degree.

954
01:01:08.76 --> 01:01:18.76
The ring of the phone itself built the tension higher and higher until the first words that came in would perhaps screw it even tighter or dispeel it entirely.

955
01:01:18.76 --> 01:01:22.76
So that's the life that they're living.

956
01:01:22.76 --> 01:01:31.76
And just high pressure all the time, but you hear a massive explosion. And this is the same thing I think Laf is talking about on the podcast.

957
01:01:31.76 --> 01:01:42.76
You know, you do your explosion? You have no idea what it is. You don't know if it's friendly, you don't know if it's a tank round being fired, you don't know if it's an ID going off, you don't know if it's a mortar round impact and you can't.

958
01:01:42.76 --> 01:01:50.76
Maybe these guys got to a point where they could tell the difference, but I'll tell you what, you're getting an urban combat and the sound is refracting off all the buildings.

959
01:01:50.76 --> 01:02:02.76
It's hard to tell where it came from and it's definitely hard to tell what it is. And by the way, the artillery rounds that hit our waters being used as IDs.

960
01:02:02.76 --> 01:02:07.76
So you don't know what it is. It's really hard to tell.

961
01:02:07.76 --> 01:02:12.76
But it was weird too in Ramadi. There was constant gunfire.

962
01:02:12.76 --> 01:02:15.76
Like, when you were outside, you just hear,

963
01:02:15.76 --> 01:02:23.76
it was always out there. Even if it was even if it was on the other side of the city, I mean, you can,

964
01:02:23.76 --> 01:02:27.76
maybe on the other side of the city. But if it was in downtown Ramadi and we were back at our base,

965
01:02:27.76 --> 01:02:32.76
you know, we'd go up on the rooftop of my building and sit there and you could just traceers all night.

966
01:02:32.76 --> 01:02:38.76
You know, the Marines down in the government center were getting attacked for the 14th night in a row.

967
01:02:38.76 --> 01:02:46.76
You know, the outpost, the army soldiers are camped, correct? Or was getting mortar done? I mean, it was just constantly happening.

968
01:02:46.76 --> 01:02:53.76
So what was it? Where you, if it's closer, that's when it's the concern or if it's just context in general.

969
01:02:53.76 --> 01:03:02.76
No, just yeah, this the overall context for us, for me, it was like, okay, you know, when you just knew that there was constant fighting on the water.

970
01:03:02.76 --> 01:03:10.76
And yeah, I mean, obviously, if it was closer, then the louder it is and the closer it is, the more of a concern it becomes.

971
01:03:10.76 --> 01:03:14.76
Certainly.

972
01:03:14.76 --> 01:03:19.76
Yeah, he talks about, again, this is a subject we hear about all the time.

973
01:03:19.76 --> 01:03:26.76
The German mortars and gunners must have registered to because they had the exact range of every foot of hydro held by the battalion.

974
01:03:26.76 --> 01:03:30.76
On the 10th of July, they covered almost every foot of the hydro.

975
01:03:30.76 --> 01:03:33.76
That sort of gunnery was rough on the men.

976
01:03:33.76 --> 01:03:43.76
They never knew in the first round would fall, but once it had splattered with its flat crash, they all knew that six or maybe it doesn't more were coming.

977
01:03:43.76 --> 01:03:47.76
Each one a little further up or down the hedgero.

978
01:03:47.76 --> 01:03:54.76
When you heard that first one, you pulled the bottom of your foxhole right up to your belly and prayed.

979
01:03:54.76 --> 01:03:59.76
When you heard the second one, you knew whether or not they were coming your way.

980
01:03:59.76 --> 01:04:03.76
If they were coming towards you, it got right rough.

981
01:04:03.76 --> 01:04:11.76
Each round was a little closer and they were so damn deliberate about it that the waiting was worth worse than the crash of the shell itself.

982
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:18.76
You laid there and counted the seconds between the shells until you knew that the next one was yours.

983
01:04:18.76 --> 01:04:22.76
The 20 seconds or so was the longest one in the world.

984
01:04:22.76 --> 01:04:32.76
Because you never knew if you were safe until the shell hit, it could hit anywhere outside your hole, even a matter of inches and you were okay.

985
01:04:32.76 --> 01:04:37.76
If it hit in the hole with you, you'd never know it, of course.

986
01:04:37.76 --> 01:04:47.76
Actually, only a few shells ever made direct hits on foxholes, but some did and nearly every man had seen a foxhole that had been hit.

987
01:04:47.76 --> 01:05:00.76
There was always the little tail fin section left on the surface and after the litter bearers had come and gone, there was only a pool of dark muck to show that somebody had been in the hole.

988
01:05:00.76 --> 01:05:03.76
It happened twice that day.

989
01:05:03.76 --> 01:05:11.76
So this one, you can, I don't know if you quite followed what's happening, these guys are in a hedgero.

990
01:05:11.76 --> 01:05:19.76
So when they're in a linear position, and the way you work mortgars is you make small adjustments on them.

991
01:05:19.76 --> 01:05:26.76
And the way that you fire at targets when you don't know what the distance is, you put the first one's going to be long.

992
01:05:26.76 --> 01:05:32.76
And then you adjust a lot shorter so then you come back and it's called bracketing.

993
01:05:32.76 --> 01:05:35.76
So you might come back five clicks.

994
01:05:35.76 --> 01:05:44.76
And then that was now you're, now you're hitting front of the target. Now you go back, now you go forward again four clicks, it hits a little behind the target, now you come back three, two, one, and then boom you hit your target.

995
01:05:44.76 --> 01:05:51.76
So on the mortar thing, there's like the actual tool that kind of, you're adjusting the elevation.

996
01:05:51.76 --> 01:05:54.76
Yeah, so it's like, it's like a little sky up and down.

997
01:05:54.76 --> 01:06:01.76
It's going up and down to, to fire at what angle you want to fire at.

998
01:06:01.76 --> 01:06:10.76
You do is when you shoot a mortar, you, you, the first one you go long, the second one you estimate short, and then you basically can split the difference between those two, you're going to be pretty close.

999
01:06:10.76 --> 01:06:17.76
And like you work with a legit mortar team and the third round is going to be pretty damn spot on.

1000
01:06:17.76 --> 01:06:24.76
But what you're saying here is the Germans, they already knew the exact settings for where to put.

1001
01:06:24.76 --> 01:06:29.76
Oh, like, oh, we see movement at this point of the head drill. They don't need to take, they just go there pre-designated settings.

1002
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:32.76
Yeah, they can put around right on that. So they kind of figured it out before.

1003
01:06:32.76 --> 01:06:36.76
Yeah, they figured it out before hand. They know the exact, because what you, what you have to, you know the distance,

1004
01:06:36.76 --> 01:06:39.76
Yeah, you know the distance at the mortar shoots at a certain elevation.

1005
01:06:39.76 --> 01:06:44.76
But what they don't know is, if you're trying to shoot at something that you don't know exactly where it is,

1006
01:06:44.76 --> 01:06:47.76
well, then you have to estimate the distance, which is a little bit challenging to do.

1007
01:06:47.76 --> 01:06:51.76
Now, a good sniper or a good mortar, but not going to be pretty close.

1008
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:58.76
You know, snipers know that, hey, this thing, they get it down to really, you know, how many meters it is, and same thing with a good mortarman.

1009
01:06:58.76 --> 01:07:04.76
But even that, you know, when you're talking about a far distance of 800,000 meters, you might be off by 50 meters.

1010
01:07:04.76 --> 01:07:11.76
And that's, you know, being off by 50 meters with a mortar is a big distance, not going to kill the target that you're trying to hit.

1011
01:07:11.76 --> 01:07:17.76
But with these Germans at this point, they already have everything measured and dialed. They have a range card as what we call it.

1012
01:07:17.76 --> 01:07:24.76
A range card means like, I know, because when you set up in a position, you could out your range grinder and you find out what the range and distance of everything that you're looking at.

1013
01:07:24.76 --> 01:07:30.76
So you know exactly how far this is. You can dial in your scope boom. Oh, I see somebody over at that corner that building. That's 832 meters boom.

1014
01:07:30.76 --> 01:07:34.76
Crack. Remember that game battleship? Remember that? I do remember that.

1015
01:07:34.76 --> 01:07:39.76
I do remember that. It's like you can't see it, but you can try to figure it out a little bit.

1016
01:07:39.76 --> 01:07:45.76
It is, you're basically your first round's going to be a little bit. If you hit something, then you got a, adjusts.

1017
01:07:45.76 --> 01:07:46.76
Yeah.

1018
01:07:46.76 --> 01:07:56.76
So what the Germans like I said, the Germans had these things pre-registered and then what they would do is they would just drop. They would just hit the whole headrow.

1019
01:07:56.76 --> 01:07:58.76
They go right down the line.

1020
01:07:58.76 --> 01:08:05.76
And these guys knew that once the first round goes, it's either going to be moving away from me on the headrow or toward me.

1021
01:08:05.76 --> 01:08:06.76
Oh, yeah.

1022
01:08:06.76 --> 01:08:12.76
And so can you imagine the damn pressure when you're sitting there that first round goes and now the next round,

1023
01:08:12.76 --> 01:08:18.76
where's it going to be further away from me? Meaning the Germans are going to, are dialing away from me or they dialing towards me.

1024
01:08:18.76 --> 01:08:24.76
And then how many rounds are they going to go? Because if they do enough rounds, you're going to be alright.

1025
01:08:24.76 --> 01:08:25.76
Yeah, that's better.

1026
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:25.76
Yeah, that's better.

1027
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:26.76
Yeah, that's better.

1028
01:08:26.76 --> 01:08:26.76
Yeah, that's better.

1029
01:08:26.76 --> 01:08:27.76
Yeah, that's better.

1030
01:08:27.76 --> 01:08:28.76
Yeah, that's better.

1031
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:34.76
And what's interesting is those, like you said, if the, if the mortar hits outside of your foxhole by an inch,

1032
01:08:34.76 --> 01:08:41.76
you're probably going to be okay because the mortar blast goes up and out when it hits the ground.

1033
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:43.76
If it hits in your foxhole, you're dead.

1034
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:48.76
And so there's this, this kind of randomness that you're dealing with.

1035
01:08:48.76 --> 01:08:52.76
Alright.

1036
01:08:52.76 --> 01:09:01.76
Going back to the book a little after this after 1700, General Gearhart came striding through the trees behind the company post hole.

1037
01:09:01.76 --> 01:09:07.76
He came on serious business that of giving orders for an attack.

1038
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:10.76
If he carried them by himself, they were important.

1039
01:09:10.76 --> 01:09:19.76
Generalman, he said, with the edge to his voice that was impressive, the Division attacks tomorrow at 0600 all along the line.

1040
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:22.76
This is the drive for St. Low.

1041
01:09:22.76 --> 01:09:24.76
There were few details.

1042
01:09:24.76 --> 01:09:28.76
The Italians would attack as the general said at 0600.

1043
01:09:28.76 --> 01:09:36.76
The first Battalion would advance in a south-western lead direction with the village of Bel Fontaine as its initial objective.

1044
01:09:36.76 --> 01:09:44.76
That was about all of them was to it except for the usual information concerning artillery support, supplies, location of regimental command post and that sort of thing.

1045
01:09:44.76 --> 01:09:48.76
So pretty broad orders.

1046
01:09:48.76 --> 01:09:49.76
Like hey, this is what we're going to do.

1047
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:51.76
We're going to attack tomorrow at 0600.

1048
01:09:51.76 --> 01:09:57.76
The mission is to get St. Low.

1049
01:09:57.76 --> 01:10:02.76
Back to the book by the time the order got down to the platoon leaders and their part, their part was pretty simple.

1050
01:10:02.76 --> 01:10:06.76
All they in turn had to say was, all right gang, let's take the next headrow.

1051
01:10:06.76 --> 01:10:10.76
When the company commanders had gone, the staff discussed the plan of attack.

1052
01:10:10.76 --> 01:10:16.76
The question bothering John's most of all was where to put the advanced command post group.

1053
01:10:16.76 --> 01:10:21.76
He wanted to hold casualties to the barest minimum, yet he wanted to be as far forward as possible.

1054
01:10:21.76 --> 01:10:28.76
So he's talking about where should he actually position himself and his small team of Battalion staff.

1055
01:10:28.76 --> 01:10:30.76
Where should they position himself?

1056
01:10:30.76 --> 01:10:42.76
It's funny too because when we talk about Battalion staff, you talk about, I don't know, a Battalion staff can be pretty big when you're in a big Battalion, but this is not a big group, this small group.

1057
01:10:42.76 --> 01:10:44.76
Especially because they've taken so many casualties.

1058
01:10:44.76 --> 01:10:47.76
Back to the book, there were a number of good reasons for this.

1059
01:10:47.76 --> 01:10:54.76
In the first place, keeping the command group close to the companies made a lot of difference in communications, particularly in this close wooded country.

1060
01:10:54.76 --> 01:11:00.76
A clump of heavy trees or a high-headrow could spell the margin between having contact and not having it.

1061
01:11:00.76 --> 01:11:03.76
That was of supreme importance.

1062
01:11:03.76 --> 01:11:08.76
Second, if you had, and this is why I was talking about keeping the plan simple.

1063
01:11:08.76 --> 01:11:19.76
Because when you start getting split up from people and you can't maintain communications with them, the difference between not having communications and having communications is night and day.

1064
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:21.76
It's disaster and success.

1065
01:11:21.76 --> 01:11:23.76
It's victory in defeat.

1066
01:11:23.76 --> 01:11:34.76
Back to the book, second, if you had to move a bog, if you had to move to a bog down company or to any trouble spot, he wanted to have the shortest possible distance to go.

1067
01:11:34.76 --> 01:11:41.76
So, he wants to be close enough to have good communications. He also wants to be close enough that if something's going wrong, he can get there and make things happen.

1068
01:11:41.76 --> 01:11:50.76
Third, the group couldn't afford to stay far behind in any event because they fully expected the German baritrapers to close in around them as soon as they started to advance.

1069
01:11:50.76 --> 01:11:57.76
If the command post group were too far from the rifle companies, it would have a good chance of getting caught off and destroyed or captured.

1070
01:11:57.76 --> 01:12:08.76
Then there was always the consideration that the men liked to know that the old man was not far behind, and to see him once in a while when the stuff was flying around.

1071
01:12:08.76 --> 01:12:15.76
So, these are things he's considering. They're getting ready. You know, it's now getting closer to the attack.

1072
01:12:15.76 --> 01:12:30.76
Back to the book, the staff was uneasy. They didn't want to turn in. They couldn't say why. There had been other nights like this. They all sense that everyone shared their own nameless fears.

1073
01:12:30.76 --> 01:12:46.76
Now they start their movement. Suddenly a terrific firing broke out. Every German cannon, morgur, rifle, and machine gun that had fired around that day, cut loose simultaneously. The sound of mortars coughing on the German side blended with the scream of incoming shells.

1074
01:12:46.76 --> 01:12:52.76
Grimsel and Hoffman slid down the steps of the hole before the first round's hit.

1075
01:12:52.76 --> 01:12:55.76
The phone rang. Major John's grabbed it. Red six.

1076
01:12:55.76 --> 01:13:04.76
Charlie sixer were catching held down here with mortars and artillery. I think that I think there's enemy infantry coming in under the fire.

1077
01:13:04.76 --> 01:13:13.76
So, the idea is, cover and move. You do this as an infantry platoon or company or battalion. You put suppressive fire.

1078
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:19.76
So you start launching mortars at your enemy. And then while they're all taking cover, you advance.

1079
01:13:19.76 --> 01:13:26.76
And so that's what he's talking about. He says, I think there's enemy infantry coming in under the fire.

1080
01:13:26.76 --> 01:13:29.76
Stone broke in.

1081
01:13:29.76 --> 01:13:38.76
The operator having wisely sensed a crisis and cut him into the circuit. So the other company commander now turns in. Same here, Major. Only I know there's infantry coming in.

1082
01:13:38.76 --> 01:13:42.76
They're already in the road with us. So there's about to get some.

1083
01:13:42.76 --> 01:13:49.76
His voice in manner were normally extremely quiet and easy going. Now his tone was strident with urgency.

1084
01:13:49.76 --> 01:13:55.76
Had it been anyone but Julian Stoen, the major might have fought. It showed near panic.

1085
01:13:55.76 --> 01:14:00.76
Okay, the both of you, he answered as calmly as he could. Stuff's coming in here too.

1086
01:14:00.76 --> 01:14:05.76
Fight him and keep me informed.

1087
01:14:05.76 --> 01:14:11.76
Major John's doesn't get excited about stuff. Very often. He says, Oh, you're getting attacked.

1088
01:14:11.76 --> 01:14:14.76
He's got to fight him. Keep me informed.

1089
01:14:14.76 --> 01:14:19.76
That's how you eat.

1090
01:14:19.76 --> 01:14:21.76
Yeah.

1091
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:29.76
Now, at some point, all the wires that I talked about that were so important for communication.

1092
01:14:29.76 --> 01:14:32.76
The crowd back at the aid station. They had a cat in the capture to guide.

1093
01:14:32.76 --> 01:14:38.76
Cried Weddle suddenly. He must have been part of patrol that came through and caught all our wires.

1094
01:14:38.76 --> 01:14:43.76
They're having been enough shells to finally falling to cut them all. The smart bastards.

1095
01:14:43.76 --> 01:14:47.76
They even knew when we checked radio as well. So these guys,

1096
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:51.76
we sent a small group of Germans went through the lines.

1097
01:14:51.76 --> 01:14:56.76
We're probably right after a radio check called the wires.

1098
01:14:56.76 --> 01:15:01.76
Yeah.

1099
01:15:01.76 --> 01:15:05.76
That's how you kick off an attack.

1100
01:15:05.76 --> 01:15:09.76
But you screw up their communications.

1101
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:15.76
Now, at this point, they are, this is turning bad real bad.

1102
01:15:15.76 --> 01:15:20.76
And this is, again, there's so much great information in here.

1103
01:15:20.76 --> 01:15:25.76
And so it's such good documentation of the way this combat takes place.

1104
01:15:25.76 --> 01:15:29.76
But at the suffice it to say at this point, I'm skipping forward.

1105
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:33.76
They are getting really crushed. They got mass casualties.

1106
01:15:33.76 --> 01:15:37.76
They are, when they advance.

1107
01:15:37.76 --> 01:15:40.76
So imagine this. Remember I talked about the Germans,

1108
01:15:40.76 --> 01:15:43.76
no exactly where their mortars are going to hit?

1109
01:15:43.76 --> 01:15:51.76
Well, the Americans will storm forward and fight hard and get to another headrow.

1110
01:15:51.76 --> 01:15:55.76
When they get to this new headrow, where the Germans were,

1111
01:15:55.76 --> 01:16:00.76
where they just beat the Germans out of there, the Germans have that headrow dialed as well.

1112
01:16:00.76 --> 01:16:04.76
So, so now as soon as they get positioned, they start getting immediate,

1113
01:16:04.76 --> 01:16:08.76
effective fire from mortars. So this is a total nightmare. And that's what's happening.

1114
01:16:08.76 --> 01:16:13.76
And at this point, they're completely bogged down.

1115
01:16:13.76 --> 01:16:18.76
And this might be, you don't get to hear a story like this very often.

1116
01:16:18.76 --> 01:16:25.76
So the regimental executive Colonel Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Smith, shows up.

1117
01:16:25.76 --> 01:16:30.76
So above the chain of command of the battalion is the regiment.

1118
01:16:30.76 --> 01:16:37.76
And the senior person in the regiment is the Colonel, the regimental commander.

1119
01:16:37.76 --> 01:16:44.76
And this is his executive. The person one down from the regimental commander is this guy Lieutenant Colonel Smith.

1120
01:16:44.76 --> 01:16:47.76
And he shows up. And he hears what he says.

1121
01:16:47.76 --> 01:16:52.76
What's the matter, John? Why aren't you getting anywhere? Smith gasped.

1122
01:16:52.76 --> 01:16:57.76
And he's gasped because he's running into this position. The major point to the bloody trail,

1123
01:16:57.76 --> 01:17:01.76
to the dead men, to the shells that were savaging the trees.

1124
01:17:01.76 --> 01:17:06.76
And finally in the direction of the nearby front from which came the plotting sound of mortar fire.

1125
01:17:06.76 --> 01:17:13.76
His eyes were lacking their usual snap. And he answered Dully, their two tough.

1126
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:18.76
Smith blinked several times. He was obviously trying to think of something to say,

1127
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:22.76
something that would inspire this listless battalion commander to New effort.

1128
01:17:22.76 --> 01:17:26.76
Well, he finally brought out. You got to get going right away.

1129
01:17:26.76 --> 01:17:29.76
Regiment has got to move. You just got to get going.

1130
01:17:29.76 --> 01:17:34.76
John's shook his head. He wasn't having any.

1131
01:17:34.76 --> 01:17:37.76
Not today was all he would say.

1132
01:17:37.76 --> 01:17:41.76
So we're talking mentally defeated at this point.

1133
01:17:41.76 --> 01:17:49.76
And even the regimental commander coming in are the regimental executive commander coming in.

1134
01:17:49.76 --> 01:17:52.76
Telling him, hey, you got to move. You just got to go.

1135
01:17:52.76 --> 01:17:56.76
Which that encouragement, this reminds me of of.

1136
01:17:56.76 --> 01:18:00.76
In just a turnance, you ever seen a coach saying, like, you got to get on top.

1137
01:18:00.76 --> 01:18:02.76
You got to do something. Got to get out of there.

1138
01:18:02.76 --> 01:18:06.76
Yeah. That doesn't help me. So that's what he's saying. Hey, you just got to go.

1139
01:18:06.76 --> 01:18:11.76
I'm getting morgered. My guys are getting mowed down. I'm not. I can't do it.

1140
01:18:11.76 --> 01:18:16.76
So back to the book then for some reason, both men looked up the headrow toward the rear.

1141
01:18:16.76 --> 01:18:23.76
Colonel McDaniel, the new division chief of staff was striding toward them, a bliviest of the fire.

1142
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:28.76
Just as he reached the command post of volley of four rounds screamed in the field just beyond the headrow.

1143
01:18:28.76 --> 01:18:33.76
The concussion tumbled him into the hole with the major and Smith.

1144
01:18:33.76 --> 01:18:38.76
But McDaniel did not lose his natural dignity and he was smiling, as he said.

1145
01:18:38.76 --> 01:18:41.76
Hello, John Smith, how are we doing?

1146
01:18:41.76 --> 01:18:48.76
Now we got a leader coming in, that's very calm and very cool and just got blasted into their hole, by the way.

1147
01:18:48.76 --> 01:18:51.76
And he looks up smiles and says how are we doing?

1148
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:59.76
John's made an effort to perk up a bit, but his voice lacked conviction or force as he told McDaniel about the situation.

1149
01:18:59.76 --> 01:19:04.76
The chief of staff surveyed the scene, weighing it all very carefully before he answered.

1150
01:19:04.76 --> 01:19:09.76
When he did, his tone was serious and he was not smiling.

1151
01:19:09.76 --> 01:19:17.76
John's, when you were on maneuvers in Louisiana or at VMI, and while you were studying at Leavenworth,

1152
01:19:17.76 --> 01:19:22.76
you saw situations where units had to be sacrificed knowingly in order to get a job done.

1153
01:19:22.76 --> 01:19:26.76
Didn't you? The battalion commander nodded.

1154
01:19:26.76 --> 01:19:34.76
When you saw those things, you probably never fought very much about them, just accepted them as a matter of course and war didn't you?

1155
01:19:34.76 --> 01:19:37.76
The major nodded again.

1156
01:19:37.76 --> 01:19:49.76
You never stopped to think, probably, that there might come a time when you and your unit would be the one that had to be sacrificed to enable the parent unit to accomplish its mission.

1157
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:53.76
The major's eyes were opening wider as he shook his head.

1158
01:19:53.76 --> 01:19:57.76
Well, I don't know for sure, but maybe this is that time.

1159
01:19:57.76 --> 01:20:04.76
I do know that this is the highest ground on the core front, and the key to the entire defense is the same low.

1160
01:20:04.76 --> 01:20:12.76
Core expects us to break it, and we think you are the man to do the job at whatever cost.

1161
01:20:12.76 --> 01:20:15.76
Now don't let us down.

1162
01:20:15.76 --> 01:20:24.76
Without another word, he got to his feet and walked back the way he'd come. The regimental executive tagged after him.

1163
01:20:24.76 --> 01:20:33.76
John's watched them go, suddenly he remembered that the general, what the general had said to him the day before, I'm counting on you.

1164
01:20:33.76 --> 01:20:39.76
He turned a weddle, who had watched this little drama with detached interest.

1165
01:20:39.76 --> 01:20:49.76
Lee Roy, the major said, is he square to shoulders and pointed to the sinking sun. Take a damn good look at that sun old boy, because it's probably the last time any of us will ever see it.

1166
01:20:49.76 --> 01:20:52.76
Let's go.

1167
01:20:52.76 --> 01:20:58.76
John's never knew later just what he did the rest of that afternoon and early evening.

1168
01:20:58.76 --> 01:21:08.76
He remembered moving around the command post forward again, and he knew that he had needleed the company commanders unmercifully, threatening them with relief of their command.

1169
01:21:08.76 --> 01:21:16.76
Begging, pleading, anything he could think of that would work with that individual at that moment.

1170
01:21:16.76 --> 01:21:21.76
He found that there was a comparatively weak spot in the German lines opposite Baker again.

1171
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:27.76
He badgered Martin into persuading the artillery to give him all the fire that he could hit that spot at one time.

1172
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:29.76
That meant a lot of guns.

1173
01:21:29.76 --> 01:21:37.76
When they all fired three rounds as fast as the gunners could load them, a hundred yards of German held headrow went up and flamed and smoke and dust.

1174
01:21:37.76 --> 01:21:43.76
Again, most of Baker companies streamed across the field and into the gap blasted by the artillery.

1175
01:21:43.76 --> 01:21:51.76
That took the heart out of the pair of troopers and the pair troopers. He's talking about our German pair troopers, who began to fall back all along the line.

1176
01:21:51.76 --> 01:21:59.76
It was no route. The Germans retired from their flanking threat Baker posed, having gained a place in their main line.

1177
01:21:59.76 --> 01:22:03.76
But they fell back slowly, fighting every foot of the way.

1178
01:22:03.76 --> 01:22:10.76
That's a nation's parachute or slow, the weak and battalion again, but they could not stop it entirely.

1179
01:22:10.76 --> 01:22:20.76
The company commanders and the platoon leaders together with Matayan CEO had thrown off their apathy, taken a second wind and were not to be denied.

1180
01:22:20.76 --> 01:22:31.76
At dark, thanks to the inspired leadership that had been provided in a few short minutes by Colonel McDaniel, the German line was broken beyond repair.

1181
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:38.76
The battered American battalion had made 500 bloody yards.

1182
01:22:38.76 --> 01:22:48.76
As dusk faded into darkness, the firing began to diminish, only to flare briefly again on the left, then it died away into silence.

1183
01:22:48.76 --> 01:22:55.76
Kenny called in to say there had been a light counter attack on the left flank, he had easily kicked it off.

1184
01:22:55.76 --> 01:23:08.76
The major did not ask for permission to halt the advance. He gave orders to dig in for the night after he was sure the companies had close contact on their flanks.

1185
01:23:08.76 --> 01:23:12.76
So, there you go.

1186
01:23:12.76 --> 01:23:24.76
That's just an amazing account of not only of leadership, but of what leadership was capable of.

1187
01:23:24.76 --> 01:23:31.76
I mean, John's was pretty much done. He's literally saying not today, they're too tough.

1188
01:23:31.76 --> 01:23:46.76
In the way that McDaniel convinces him and explains to him that you know those times, those times when you were doing exercises and they'd sacrifice a unit to that they can accomplish the mission.

1189
01:23:46.76 --> 01:23:55.76
I'm not sure, but I think you're that unit right now, and we're counting on you to get it done.

1190
01:23:55.76 --> 01:24:05.76
Unbelievable.

1191
01:24:05.76 --> 01:24:15.76
You know, that's one of those things too, where that's where you know from a leadership perspective.

1192
01:24:15.76 --> 01:24:32.76
You know, you know, entering a situation where duty is going to be the most important thing to you, and you also know that the mission is the most important thing.

1193
01:24:32.76 --> 01:24:38.76
You've got to put that at the top of your priorities, and you know you're going to sacrifice guys and it's going to be a nightmare.

1194
01:24:38.76 --> 01:24:47.76
But the alternative is you're not going to win. You're going to you're not going to win.

1195
01:24:47.76 --> 01:24:54.76
That's the alternative is that your team is not going to be able to achieve this.

1196
01:24:54.76 --> 01:25:01.76
And, and you know, at this point in the war, this war was not settled yet by any stretch.

1197
01:25:01.76 --> 01:25:12.76
This war was not settled, and so to give up ground and start to let the Germans reorganize and let them start to gain high ground, which is what they were fighting for here.

1198
01:25:12.76 --> 01:25:16.76
That's not just going to affect your mind. It's going to affect everybody.

1199
01:25:16.76 --> 01:25:26.76
And so I've said this on the podcast before the definition of a team is when the members of the team think the team is more important than themselves.

1200
01:25:26.76 --> 01:25:39.76
And that's what you see right here. They realize John's realizes that look, we're going to be, and the title of the book is clay pigeons, you know what a clay pigeon is right?

1201
01:25:39.76 --> 01:25:40.76
Yes, yes.

1202
01:25:40.76 --> 01:25:45.76
What you throw up in the air and shoot that and it's just, it's a sacrificial piece of clay.

1203
01:25:45.76 --> 01:25:54.76
And that's why the name of the book is the clay pigeons, the same low, because that's in many cases the situation that they're in.

1204
01:25:54.76 --> 01:26:09.76
So this is different than when Napoleon says, hey, if you get told to do something and it's not smart and you do it anyways, you're culpable.

1205
01:26:09.76 --> 01:26:27.76
Yeah. John's, he can't say, look, no, this isn't smart. He knows it's the right thing to do. He, that's, that's the big difference that I'm trying to get out here. This isn't a guy who's saying, look, hey, we're going to charge this machine gun nest and I'm going to lose it, you know, half my platoon.

1206
01:26:27.76 --> 01:26:34.76
But it's not going to make any big deal. And I'm a little bad leader because I sacrificed my platoon for a meaningless machine gun nest.

1207
01:26:34.76 --> 01:26:55.76
This is a guy that knows that this objective is important, knows that this high ground is needed, knows that the success of this, not just this mission, but the success of this whole, a, a salt on France and thereby Germany is writing on what they're doing.

1208
01:26:55.76 --> 01:27:07.76
So you could break it down and say, well, you know, that made, they could hold back and they could wait. Well, what happens when you hold back and wait? Do the Germans have more reinforcements that they're sending their way? You know, what's, what does that actually mean?

1209
01:27:07.76 --> 01:27:22.76
And so he is calculated in his mind, you know what? We need to do this for the good of everyone we need to do this.

1210
01:27:22.76 --> 01:27:35.76
One point now, fast forwarding, pass some more of that flighting. They do a good job of kind of, they've, they've knocked out some of the through through some fierce fighting.

1211
01:27:35.76 --> 01:27:40.76
They've knocked out and they've moved forward and they've hold up and now they start advancing again.

1212
01:27:40.76 --> 01:27:55.76
Here we go back to the book, one, one well placed stubborn hostile machine gun, stopped that flank attack, called so they're attacking and they get stopped by one well placed machine gun. The German gunner got off got half of the small squad that tried to rush him through the smoke.

1213
01:27:55.76 --> 01:27:59.76
And the attackers had to withdraw, dragging their wounded with them.

1214
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:14.76
Mortars and artillery left the German undamaged. Rifle grenades couldn't quite hit the narrow slit through which he was firing. Two grandadiers trying to take extra careful aim had also been hit by concealed German snipers.

1215
01:28:14.76 --> 01:28:19.76
When the major arrived it looked as though progress had stopped.

1216
01:28:19.76 --> 01:28:34.76
Using the battalion radio to the rear command post and the artillery phoned from there, he adjusted 18 successive rounds from one gun of the 110th field artillery battalion in a vain attempt to sharp shoot the machine gun out of existence.

1217
01:28:34.76 --> 01:28:36.76
But he couldn't hit it.

1218
01:28:36.76 --> 01:28:44.76
And after each round burst on or near the headrow, the enemy would reply with a derice of verb burst.

1219
01:28:44.76 --> 01:28:48.76
There was only one answer, a tank.

1220
01:28:48.76 --> 01:28:52.76
And he was miraculously a tank appeared.

1221
01:28:52.76 --> 01:28:59.76
So that's what I'm talking about. He tries with, there's one machine gun that's holding up the situation.

1222
01:28:59.76 --> 01:29:06.76
He gets on the radio and cars all to artillery, which is similar to mortars, they're bigger and more powerful.

1223
01:29:06.76 --> 01:29:12.76
But it's the same thing. It's indirect fire. You're putting rounds far up in the air and they're through a big arc.

1224
01:29:12.76 --> 01:29:18.76
And when he's going 1000s and 1000s of feet in some cases in the air and then coming basically straight down on a target.

1225
01:29:18.76 --> 01:29:27.76
And it's, when I say it's hard to hit a target, he's fires 18 rounds to try and hit this machine gun, bunker to machine gun, can't stop it.

1226
01:29:27.76 --> 01:29:30.76
Can't help it.

1227
01:29:30.76 --> 01:29:40.76
So he needs a tank and then miraculously, and if you don't know anything about my incredible affection for tanks and for tankers,

1228
01:29:40.76 --> 01:29:51.76
because of what they were able to do in the battle or body to not only for themselves, but to support and save my guys time and time again.

1229
01:29:51.76 --> 01:29:53.76
I'm a big fan of tanks.

1230
01:29:53.76 --> 01:29:56.76
In fact, I love tanks and tankers. Let's straight up.

1231
01:29:56.76 --> 01:29:57.76
Yeah.

1232
01:29:57.76 --> 01:30:00.76
That's the way it is. And this is why, this is why right here.

1233
01:30:00.76 --> 01:30:07.76
Back to the book, one steel monster, monster lumbered up behind John's who yelled instructions to the tank commander.

1234
01:30:07.76 --> 01:30:15.76
The gunner watched carefully while an infantry squad leader fired a clip of Tracer bullets at the slit that hid the machine gun.

1235
01:30:15.76 --> 01:30:20.76
And then swung his shortboard, barreled little 75 into line.

1236
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:28.76
It crashed once and almost simultaneously with the muzzle blast came the crack of white phosphorus shell as it hit the slit.

1237
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:33.76
The smoke blossomed up from behind the headrow indicating a direct hit.

1238
01:30:33.76 --> 01:30:37.76
With that, a single paratrooper came running toward them.

1239
01:30:37.76 --> 01:30:43.76
A few moments later, everything on the front cut loose, the enemy and the company charged,

1240
01:30:43.76 --> 01:30:49.76
and another hundred yards of French real estate had changed hands.

1241
01:30:49.76 --> 01:30:57.76
Then in the major, the major wished every machine gunner in his outfit could have seen that position as an illustration of what skill,

1242
01:30:57.76 --> 01:31:03.76
to nasty and guts could do to build and defend one machine gun position.

1243
01:31:03.76 --> 01:31:09.76
So, machine gunners, tanks.

1244
01:31:09.76 --> 01:31:11.76
Yeah.

1245
01:31:11.76 --> 01:31:14.76
It's incredible what a machine gunner is.

1246
01:31:14.76 --> 01:31:22.76
A normal, like a Mark 48 machine gunner, the old M60 Roger Hayden talk about carrying the 60.

1247
01:31:22.76 --> 01:31:27.76
Right. And our boys last to point my last to point into the body, you can get guys are carrying Mark 48s.

1248
01:31:27.76 --> 01:31:31.76
Or Mark 46s which is a smaller round of 556 round.

1249
01:31:31.76 --> 01:31:34.76
M60, that's what Rambo had, right?

1250
01:31:34.76 --> 01:31:35.76
That is in the front.

1251
01:31:35.76 --> 01:31:36.76
Yes, yes.

1252
01:31:36.76 --> 01:31:37.76
And command it by the way.

1253
01:31:37.76 --> 01:31:39.76
Okay, I'll take your words.

1254
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:41.76
John Matrix to be exact.

1255
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:43.76
No, that was his knee.

1256
01:31:43.76 --> 01:31:44.76
Okay.

1257
01:31:44.76 --> 01:31:48.76
The M60, the Belphead machine gun.

1258
01:31:48.76 --> 01:31:53.76
They're not that big of a weapon. I mean, it's big and bleached. Believe me when you're carrying 800,

1259
01:31:53.76 --> 01:31:55.76
2000 rounds, it's big enough.

1260
01:31:55.76 --> 01:32:01.76
But if you think about a whole, you know, a battalion worth the guys are getting stopped by a guy in a machine gun.

1261
01:32:01.76 --> 01:32:02.76
Yeah.

1262
01:32:02.76 --> 01:32:03.76
Eating good position.

1263
01:32:03.76 --> 01:32:05.76
Now, he had snipers, snipers covering him.

1264
01:32:05.76 --> 01:32:09.76
Two snipers apparently were covering him, but that's not many people.

1265
01:32:09.76 --> 01:32:16.76
That's why when you're on the offense, you need more people than being in a defense position.

1266
01:32:16.76 --> 01:32:25.76
You know, when you're in a defense position, and you're allowed that you have time to set up, that's why when you go back to, well, when you look at normally, when you look at this whole,

1267
01:32:25.76 --> 01:32:28.76
if you look at World War II, it's a whole.

1268
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:38.76
The both, the allies and what we did in Normandy taking the beaches and what you did every time in a Pacific, taking the beaches,

1269
01:32:38.76 --> 01:32:41.76
you're going against bunker positions like this.

1270
01:32:41.76 --> 01:32:47.76
Yeah, fully. And it's just incredible the tenacity that it takes to make this happen.

1271
01:32:47.76 --> 01:32:53.76
Yeah, isn't that the whole, in a way, the whole idea behind Gorilla Warfare, where it's like, we're just, we're kind of,

1272
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:55.76
if we're not fighting, we're not fighting in, then all of a sudden.

1273
01:32:55.76 --> 01:32:56.76
We're fighting in the West.

1274
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:04.76
That is, that is behind Gorilla Warfare, but this isn't Gorilla Warfare, even without, even without sneaking around.

1275
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:05.76
Right. Right.

1276
01:33:05.76 --> 01:33:10.76
You're in a uniformed soldier, German, and you go, okay, I'm going to set up a bunker position.

1277
01:33:10.76 --> 01:33:19.76
On this high ground, it where I have the enemy channelized in this area, and I have good spread on them, and the only weak spots I've got, I'm going to cover them with snipers.

1278
01:33:19.76 --> 01:33:20.76
Yeah.

1279
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:22.76
Three people holding up a battalion.

1280
01:33:22.76 --> 01:33:28.76
And just think, you know, if, if, then once you get that position, we have mortars already dialed in when you get there.

1281
01:33:28.76 --> 01:33:30.76
That are going to start hitting you.

1282
01:33:30.76 --> 01:33:33.76
And then the next thing you do is you got to move again.

1283
01:33:33.76 --> 01:33:38.76
Well, guess what, we got another three, four, five guys in machine gun positions, mutually supporting each other.

1284
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:52.76
That's why this, this, these American Allied fighting forces, and the Americans here in the American specific going against burdened, bunker positions is incredible.

1285
01:33:52.76 --> 01:33:53.76
It's incredible.

1286
01:33:53.76 --> 01:33:54.76
Yeah.

1287
01:33:54.76 --> 01:34:03.76
Now, he's given kind of an overview of war and, and here we go.

1288
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:23.76
Thus goes battle. A rush, a pause, some creeping, a few isolated shots here and there, some artillery fire, some mortars, some smoke, more creeping, another pause, dead silence, more firing, a great concentration of fire, followed by a concerted rush, then the whole process starts all over again.

1289
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:26.76
The defender, this is good information.

1290
01:34:26.76 --> 01:34:34.76
The defender, will almost always hold out some reserve, even though his front line is being torn to bits, at least he should.

1291
01:34:34.76 --> 01:34:40.76
He may inflict all the damage on the attacker that he can while giving ground slowly.

1292
01:34:40.76 --> 01:34:52.76
Then, when he thinks the attacker is weakening, or when the defense has reached a certain piece of ground that the defender has chosen for the purpose, he launches a counter attack with his reserves.

1293
01:34:52.76 --> 01:35:02.76
The attacker has used much of his strength, his men are tired, probably short of ammunition, and are almost inevitably somewhat disorganized.

1294
01:35:02.76 --> 01:35:09.76
Then the defender throws fresh troops into a counter attack, overgrounded, his men know.

1295
01:35:09.76 --> 01:35:14.76
Unless the attackers are very strong, they must inevitably suffer.

1296
01:35:14.76 --> 01:35:24.76
Often, they are defeated, and thrown back, or destroyed. So, there you go. I mean, this happens in mixed martial arts, it happens in sports, it happens on the battlefield.

1297
01:35:24.76 --> 01:35:36.76
You guys are pushing forward on the attack, and you take away, you chip away at them a little bit, you give them ground, you give them ground, and then when they get spread out, they're low on ammunition, boom, then you hit them on a counter attack, on a ground that you already know.

1298
01:35:36.76 --> 01:35:43.76
Back to the book, such counter attack tactics have been standard, almost as long as they've been organized armies.

1299
01:35:43.76 --> 01:35:47.76
The Germans employed them so regularly that they were never a surprise.

1300
01:35:47.76 --> 01:35:53.76
But the enemy could never muster, seem to muster the strength necessary to make their counter attack stick.

1301
01:35:53.76 --> 01:36:04.76
Their efforts often halted in advance, as they had the night before, but they rarely gained back any ground, and were almost always costly to the counter attackers.

1302
01:36:04.76 --> 01:36:10.76
Even the best and most proven tactics still require judgment, and the force to do the job.

1303
01:36:10.76 --> 01:36:14.76
The Germans rarely had enough of either.

1304
01:36:14.76 --> 01:36:20.76
So, there's a little breakdown on what's happening with the Germans. First of all, the night using good judgment, they're just like standard operating procedure.

1305
01:36:20.76 --> 01:36:25.76
We're going to counter attack every single time. And when you counter attack, you're taking losses, especially if you're not gaining ground.

1306
01:36:25.76 --> 01:36:33.76
So, they're standard operating procedure, we're going to counter attack, and they're not gaining ground, and so what are they doing? They're losing guys.

1307
01:36:33.76 --> 01:36:39.76
And the more guys you lose, the less guys you have to counter attack with the next time.

1308
01:36:39.76 --> 01:36:49.76
Now, they had a group here that was working in the battalion.

1309
01:36:49.76 --> 01:36:52.76
They were called the commandos.

1310
01:36:52.76 --> 01:36:55.76
And it was just like a little elite group that they were using.

1311
01:36:55.76 --> 01:37:01.76
They would guard the command post, but then they would also win something that's going down. They'd get out there and get after it's super aggressive.

1312
01:37:01.76 --> 01:37:10.76
But they were running so low on people that they needed to put the commandos team back out into the companies, the regular companies.

1313
01:37:10.76 --> 01:37:19.76
So, there had been a little commando, a little special unit within the battalion, and then they had to take those guys and put them back out with the regular companies.

1314
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:29.76
Now, here we go back to the book. In the middle of the afternoon, the CEO moved up close behind a company to watch their contingent of former battalion commandos going to the line.

1315
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:36.76
Sergeant Turner, who had been in charge of the platoon of the commandal platoon, was with them.

1316
01:37:36.76 --> 01:37:43.76
Seeing the major, he fell behind long enough to say, Sir, we're going in there to help our buddies from old A company.

1317
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:50.76
Lick the hell out of those bastards, but when we get through this, I'd sure like to come back and get into the bunch of commandos for the battalion.

1318
01:37:50.76 --> 01:37:53.76
His cool voice ended on a rising note.

1319
01:37:53.76 --> 01:38:02.76
All right, Sergeant, you go to send a Saint-Low, and I'll promise you you get another platoon of your hellrazers just as soon as we can spare them from the companies.

1320
01:38:02.76 --> 01:38:10.76
John's returned to the sergeants. John's returned to Sergeant Slutes, and watched the man as he ran to catch up with the others.

1321
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:22.76
An hour later, a weasel, which is a small, purpose-tracked vehicle, flying a red cross flag, clattered out of the woods, carrying a load of wounded on litters.

1322
01:38:22.76 --> 01:38:27.76
The battalion commander, who is passing the spot, stopped when he saw the wounded.

1323
01:38:27.76 --> 01:38:35.76
The little commando sergeant lay on the litter on the near side, seeing the major he yelled for the driver to stop.

1324
01:38:35.76 --> 01:38:46.76
John's went over to him, and the boy, both his legs wrapped in dirty, bloody bandages, grabbed his commander's shirt, and pulled himself up on the litter.

1325
01:38:46.76 --> 01:38:54.76
He was crying openly and unassimedly as he burst out with the flood of invective.

1326
01:38:54.76 --> 01:38:56.76
They got all my boys major.

1327
01:38:56.76 --> 01:39:00.76
We didn't get off the LD, which is the line of departure.

1328
01:39:00.76 --> 01:39:03.76
I let you down major. I let you down.

1329
01:39:03.76 --> 01:39:07.76
He stopped and sobbed bitterly before he could go on.

1330
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:15.76
Major John's could feel his own throat constricting as he held the tightly gripping hands that shook him again and again, as the sergeant poured out his grief and rage.

1331
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:19.76
We had to get that gun.

1332
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:21.76
Damn the dirty bastards.

1333
01:39:21.76 --> 01:39:23.76
God damn.

1334
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:27.76
I let him get me with a fucking machine gun, and they got all my boys to.

1335
01:39:27.76 --> 01:39:29.76
God damn.

1336
01:39:29.76 --> 01:39:31.76
He sobbed uncontrollably.

1337
01:39:31.76 --> 01:39:37.76
While the weasel driver began to let his clutch take hold, but I'll be back, major, sir.

1338
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:38.76
I'll be back.

1339
01:39:38.76 --> 01:39:40.76
I'll be back.

1340
01:39:40.76 --> 01:39:42.76
Sure boy.

1341
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:47.76
And I'll have your old job for you anytime. You just take it easy and get those legs fixed.

1342
01:39:47.76 --> 01:39:53.76
The major was walking slowly beside the litter, trying to gently disengage the grip on his shirt.

1343
01:39:53.76 --> 01:39:58.76
The sergeant let go and fell back on the litter exhausted.

1344
01:39:58.76 --> 01:40:03.76
John's looked up at the aid man who slowly shook his head.

1345
01:40:03.76 --> 01:40:17.76
The sergeant would not be back.

1346
01:40:17.76 --> 01:40:31.76
Now they are finally pushing into St. Low and they have to go down this or the direction of attack that they're taking is down this.

1347
01:40:31.76 --> 01:40:39.76
Down this single road that heads into St. Low and the Germans have it dialed.

1348
01:40:39.76 --> 01:40:44.76
They have it dialed with ranged, you know, with artillery ready to hit it.

1349
01:40:44.76 --> 01:40:49.76
And here we go. They have hit it. They're starting to hit it with big rounds.

1350
01:40:49.76 --> 01:40:53.76
Back the book, John's noted that the German fire was coming in slowly.

1351
01:40:53.76 --> 01:40:56.76
There couldn't have been more than two or three guns firing.

1352
01:40:56.76 --> 01:41:00.76
As they were all big ones, they didn't fire rapidly.

1353
01:41:00.76 --> 01:41:04.76
That was a break. But just one of those big shells in the wrong place.

1354
01:41:04.76 --> 01:41:10.76
As the next one began to howl the men began to look for deeper spots in the ditches.

1355
01:41:10.76 --> 01:41:13.76
John's yelled, keep going damn it. It's not here yet.

1356
01:41:13.76 --> 01:41:18.76
The men kept going forward for several more seconds running hard now.

1357
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:21.76
The shell was nearly on the ground before the major yelled again.

1358
01:41:21.76 --> 01:41:23.76
Down.

1359
01:41:23.76 --> 01:41:29.76
Although the men hit the ditches, John was too excited to remember he was in the middle of the road.

1360
01:41:29.76 --> 01:41:33.76
He went down on one knee. The shell burst 100 yards ahead.

1361
01:41:33.76 --> 01:41:35.76
Again, nobody was hit.

1362
01:41:35.76 --> 01:41:39.76
The instant burst, the major was up yelling, let's go running as he yelled.

1363
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:42.76
His men got up and ran too.

1364
01:41:42.76 --> 01:41:45.76
Hoffman and Grismel are grim cell.

1365
01:41:45.76 --> 01:41:53.76
Catching the idea, moved further back down the line of men to relay commands and call signals on the shells.

1366
01:41:53.76 --> 01:41:57.76
When the next one hit, all three officers did the same.

1367
01:41:57.76 --> 01:41:59.76
None of them got off the road.

1368
01:41:59.76 --> 01:42:05.76
Here and there, non-combs without orders began to fill in the gaps, staying on the road themselves.

1369
01:42:05.76 --> 01:42:11.76
By the time the third shell hit, the whole column was working as smoothly as if it had been on a parade ground drill.

1370
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:16.76
And they were losing no time. They kept going. A few men were hit but not many.

1371
01:42:16.76 --> 01:42:20.76
Oddly, oddly enough, not an officer or non-com was knocked out of the middle of the road.

1372
01:42:20.76 --> 01:42:23.76
Though each leader only went down on one knee.

1373
01:42:23.76 --> 01:42:33.76
One shell burst, not 24, five yards ahead of the major, but it hit just around a small bend in the road and he was sheltered by the bank.

1374
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:41.76
He ran forward through the smoke and dust, nearly falling over a man who is rolling crazily half in and half out of the ditch.

1375
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:46.76
John's grabbed him by the arm to help him to his feet crying, come on boy, let's go.

1376
01:42:46.76 --> 01:42:50.76
The man tried to get up but stumbled awkwardly forward.

1377
01:42:50.76 --> 01:42:55.76
Only then did John's look down and see that the soldier had no feet.

1378
01:42:55.76 --> 01:43:04.76
He was trying violently to stand on the stumps of his two legs, where his feet had been sliced cleanly off just at the ankles.

1379
01:43:04.76 --> 01:43:08.76
John's laid him back gently into the ditch and changed his tone.

1380
01:43:08.76 --> 01:43:15.76
Maybe you better take it easy while son. You stay here until one of your buddies gets here. There'll be a long, in a minute.

1381
01:43:15.76 --> 01:43:22.76
The man himself was an aid man and not another was in sight, but the Italian commander had no time for one man.

1382
01:43:22.76 --> 01:43:34.76
So after a quick look to see that the stumps were not bleeding profusely, he patted the man on the back saying, see you later, but then he ran to catch up to his place in the column.

1383
01:43:34.76 --> 01:43:43.76
A little further down the road after another burst, he saw another man lying in the ditch, not making any move to get up and go, although he didn't seem to be hurt.

1384
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:50.76
John stopped, grabbed him by the arm and yelled again, come on, let's get going.

1385
01:43:50.76 --> 01:43:58.76
Looking blankly up at him, the soldier pushed a camera forward, saying plaintively, I'm a cameraman.

1386
01:43:58.76 --> 01:44:06.76
This rocked the major for a moment, then he said, well you can't take any pictures in that ditch, get going.

1387
01:44:06.76 --> 01:44:28.76
So again, you see leadership in action. You see him having to actually lead and set the example and his other, the company commanders, and eventually the the senior enlisted guys all follow his lead of what he's doing.

1388
01:44:28.76 --> 01:44:39.76
We got time to run. We got a minute of whatever it is, 30 seconds. We're going to get up, we're going to run as hard as we can, when we when we know we're going to get hit with the shell, we're going to get down and take cover.

1389
01:44:39.76 --> 01:44:44.76
Pure leadership.

1390
01:44:44.76 --> 01:44:51.76
Now once they get kind of into St. Lowe, there's a kernel shows up, starts getting told what to do.

1391
01:44:51.76 --> 01:44:56.76
Back to the book, the kernel is giving orders again. I want you to clear this town as quickly as you can. There aren't many Germans in it,

1392
01:44:56.76 --> 01:45:05.76
but there are a few and I want it all clear. Your battalion is the only infantry we have with the task force, as you are the ranking officer, you will be in command of all the troops in town.

1393
01:45:05.76 --> 01:45:14.76
He looked closely at the major who not had tried to contain the elation he felt knowing that he would have command on the ground of what would undoubtedly be his historical action.

1394
01:45:14.76 --> 01:45:20.76
The kernel thrust a map at him. Here's a large scale map of the town itself now, get going.

1395
01:45:20.76 --> 01:45:25.76
Major John's turn to look for Wendell, Weddle and Grimsel.

1396
01:45:25.76 --> 01:45:34.76
His two staff officers turned to company commanders. Both were almost at his elbow. He drew them to one side and divided the town between them.

1397
01:45:34.76 --> 01:45:39.76
So now they're kind of on the outskirts of St. Lowe and they're starting to clear the town.

1398
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:48.76
And we have, so the companies go out and start clearing the town and they've set up a little makeshift command post for major John's.

1399
01:45:48.76 --> 01:46:03.76
And he's standing there with his gott. He's got a bunch of new guys with him too. He's got all these replacements. Because remember, an hour and a half ago when I said hey these guys have already had 300 replacements. Well that has kept up the whole time.

1400
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:10.76
They're getting all these replacements. So at this point, this is an interesting leadership story. He's got some new guys that show up.

1401
01:46:10.76 --> 01:46:24.76
And there's he's standing in his new command post and these new guys, he sees like a position that needs to be taken to make sure that you know we have some security around the command post.

1402
01:46:24.76 --> 01:46:34.76
And so here we go. He motion to the PFC and three other men standing nearby. They came forward rifles ready. So these are three new guys. Just replacements just showed up.

1403
01:46:34.76 --> 01:46:41.76
And again, the probably the most fire they've seen was running into the town with St. Louis avoiding big giant howlits or shells that are hitting them.

1404
01:46:41.76 --> 01:46:51.76
Back to the book. See that alley there said John's pointing. I want you to take these three men and go down to the end of it. Looks like about 100 yards where you will set up an outpost. Lieutenant Lickory.

1405
01:46:51.76 --> 01:47:07.76
We'll come around later to see how you're doing. The PFC squinted down the alley, nodded at a trifle uncertainly and started toward it. The others followed, but the major was too preoccupied to note that there had been no briefing and no assignment of positions or duties.

1406
01:47:07.76 --> 01:47:13.76
They just trooped off down the alley together like a bunch of men going to the post exchange.

1407
01:47:13.76 --> 01:47:29.76
Two minutes after they left, the sound of German machine gun fire came from the direction of the narrow passageway. John's turned to look out of the alley, pelted the foremen. Straight toward him. The private first class-panted sir. There's a machine gun down there.

1408
01:47:29.76 --> 01:47:41.76
The Battalion commander didn't know whether to be amused or angry. There was no telling what the new men were apt to do if they didn't have leadership of an experienced or well-trained non-comer officer.

1409
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:59.76
He decided to be gentle. Yes, I heard it. Now, tell you what to do. You take these three men again, assign one to take a place where he can shoot at the gun or where you think the gun is, then take the other two and see if you can't come around behind it and get it for me.

1410
01:47:59.76 --> 01:48:17.76
So, they'll cover the move. They'll be a little simple. They'll cover the move. You get where you can shoot the gun, have that guy get where you can shoot the gun, and then you guys maneuver behind it. Cover the move. Beautiful. The PFC took that in, noted somewhat less uncertainly.

1411
01:48:17.76 --> 01:48:29.76
Motion to the men to follow him and started purposefully back down the alley. In not more than five minutes there came in rapid succession, the sound of the machine gun, a few rifle shots, two grenades and running feet.

1412
01:48:29.76 --> 01:48:49.76
Once had moved across the street looking for the best place for a temporary command post, he turned toward the mouth of the alley wondering what would come out this time. Two Germans showed first running toward him at full speed. Before the major could bring a submachine gun up, he saw the PFC in one other man prodding the Germans from behind with bay and nets.

1413
01:48:49.76 --> 01:49:03.76
He spotted him and poked the prisoner in his direction. They stopped in front of him before he noticed the MG 34, the PFC was dragging behind him, so they actually had the German machine gun.

1414
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:12.76
The man dropped the gun in front of him saying, here's the gun you wanted major, but this is all that's left of the crew. We had to kill two of them, sir.

1415
01:49:12.76 --> 01:49:23.76
Major John's gulped, nodded, and motion to gay was another one of the guys to come to get the prisoners. The private first class in his helpers jog back toward their new outpost.

1416
01:49:23.76 --> 01:49:34.76
The major looked after them wondering just what sort of training or indoctrination they must have had, first to run away from an enemy without trying to fight back and then to apologize for having killed two.

1417
01:49:34.76 --> 01:49:44.76
He looked down at the German, that the battered German machine gun kicked it idly and reminded himself to be more careful in issuing orders to new men.

1418
01:49:44.76 --> 01:49:57.76
They were apt to take things a bit on the literal side. He was sure that the PFC had actually thought that the seal himself had a personal desire for the machine gun they had knocked out.

1419
01:49:57.76 --> 01:50:10.76
He would have gone to any ends to retrieve the gun itself in order to bring it back just because the major had added that for me when he ordered them to get the gun.

1420
01:50:10.76 --> 01:50:26.76
That's a common thing to add. Back when he worked at the nightclub, you hear that all the time. Especially when you're managing big crowds. You say, hey, can you slide over on the side here for me and they'd always add the for me.

1421
01:50:26.76 --> 01:50:41.76
I mean, it's so common. But when you really think about it, it's kind of a strange thing to add, but I think it adds like this personal touch.

1422
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:59.76
All right. Now he's in the command post, Wettelhoes, one of the company commanders. These guys are out clearing the city and he hears some commotion comes back into one of the rooms and Wettels in there with one of the other officers or one of the other officers they're working on them.

1423
01:50:59.76 --> 01:51:11.76
Back to the book, Brooks sobbing was carefully cutting away the officer's field jacket and shirt exposing a wide deep gas just below the shoulder. John Stomach turned over quickly when he saw the wound.

1424
01:51:11.76 --> 01:51:18.76
The bone was shattered with sharp splintered ends sticking through the bloody pulpy massive torn flesh.

1425
01:51:18.76 --> 01:51:32.76
That's this is Wettelhoes talking about. Wettelhoes damn near right. They'd almost blow his arm plumb off. The S3 moaned closed his eyes as he leaned back to let Brooks doody could with the nasty wound.

1426
01:51:32.76 --> 01:51:44.76
But he pulled himself together in a moment or two and open his eyes to look at the seal. So here he is. Wettelhoes just in agony, but he gets gets a grip. Then he looks at the seal.

1427
01:51:44.76 --> 01:51:59.76
Squeezes eyes together harder than looks at the seal and says, I would just come back to tell you he'd ground out between clenched teeth that we have our side of the town all clear with the man out on the edge when the artillery caught me in the middle of the street.

1428
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:18.76
He flinched his face twisted in pain when the aid man who had taken over from Brooks inadvertently twisted his arm as he sprinkled sulfal powder into the wound. Then he went on. Chadwick is back. Didn't know it until I saw him. Came up just came just before we pulled out out of the little road back up the hill.

1429
01:52:18.76 --> 01:52:36.76
You can put him in command. He's good. He was gasping at the words now. Major, can you get me out of here? I don't want to lose this arm. Sure boy, we'll get you out. Just try to relax now. Don't worry about it. Take it easy. We'll have you back to where they can fix it up in no time.

1430
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:58.76
Weddle leaned heavily on Brooks who was still sobbing from the shock of seeing his captain so badly wounded. Weddle and Brooks had been together a long time and made your new the sergeant would be no good around the command post for a while. So he motioned him to go along and look after the wounded S3.

1431
01:52:58.76 --> 01:53:09.76
So again, you know, major Jones realizes that somebody's at their capacity for handling the horrors of war and says hey, you take this guy back to the aid station.

1432
01:53:09.76 --> 01:53:21.76
Now there's a German counterattacks. So they're in St. Louis, the got things decently handled, but all of a sudden they start seeing it and there's a guy in the field named Barnes and he's starting to report back.

1433
01:53:21.76 --> 01:53:42.76
They're they're forming up a big counterattack and also their field phones are been lost wires. So they don't have good communications. They see this thing forming up. There's going to be overwhelmed. They're really underman. St. Louis is a pretty big city. It's all kind of destroyed, but it's still too big for the amount of people that they have.

1434
01:53:42.76 --> 01:53:55.76
And so they're really scared that there's going to be a big counterattack in the terms. Gonna take the city back. So they finally get through. They don't even know who they're talking to. They're just trying to get through to somebody that can pass word to get the artillery to start dropping bombs.

1435
01:53:55.76 --> 01:54:09.76
And Henderson is one of the guys on the on the radio. And he says, damn it man. This is the Goon Red and St. Louis. We've need our deliveries worse than the ever needed anything in all our lives. And we need it right now. All our lines are rear.

1436
01:54:09.76 --> 01:54:17.76
All our lines to the rear are out and our wire people spliced one and got you. Now quit asking damn fool questions and tell me if you can shoot for us and say hello.

1437
01:54:17.76 --> 01:54:26.76
So this is going back and forth. They start dropping bombs and all of a sudden they start adjusting the bombing closer and closer to them to their own lines.

1438
01:54:26.76 --> 01:54:37.76
Back to the book Angel Fire Direction Center was questioning the adjustment. The correction would bring the shells inside the no fire line maybe on friendly troops.

1439
01:54:37.76 --> 01:54:50.76
Hell yes, we got do's on the edge of town. Who do you think wants this stuff anyways? The artillery man was frantic afraid of the safety rules. The big guns would make them stop them just when they needed the most.

1440
01:54:50.76 --> 01:55:01.76
Please sir, he pleaded. Just put it out there. The infantry battalion commander is standing right beside me praying for more of it. The last volley was right in there, but the Germans are still coming.

1441
01:55:01.76 --> 01:55:11.76
They stand. They get them to drop more bombs and barrens the guys out in the field, calls back in again. That was marvelous. Do it again some more.

1442
01:55:11.76 --> 01:55:22.76
And then the guys transfer in that repeat range. Fire for effect. Give us all you have and give it quick. You're breaking up the attack and you're all we have.

1443
01:55:22.76 --> 01:55:34.76
And that's enough. They bomb the Jesus out of the Germans and that pretty much breaks the attack.

1444
01:55:34.76 --> 01:55:42.76
And again, I'm summing up like seven pages of extended combat.

1445
01:55:42.76 --> 01:55:58.76
And finally, though, the battle is for the most part over. And they've got stabilized. They kind of set some security and here we go back to the book. Major John's his face in his hands as he sat down for the first time in hours.

1446
01:55:58.76 --> 01:56:03.76
He couldn't help thinking of the death and agony to so many men so needlessly.

1447
01:56:03.76 --> 01:56:10.76
It hurt, damnably. Deep inside.

1448
01:56:10.76 --> 01:56:18.76
And then a liaison officer from Regiment came in with a lieutenant Colonel, his staff, and all of his company commanders.

1449
01:56:18.76 --> 01:56:25.76
They were from the 134th Regiment of the 35th Division, which was to relieve the first battalion at once.

1450
01:56:25.76 --> 01:56:38.76
John's could hardly believe it. Even when he saw his replacement standing there looking fresh and confident he was beginning to think that clay pigeons were supposed to go on forever fighting all alone except for the artillery.

1451
01:56:38.76 --> 01:56:51.76
The new battalion commander wondered about Major John's staff, so he's got a guy coming in to take over. They're getting relieved.

1452
01:56:51.76 --> 01:56:57.76
And the guy says, you know, hey, what's up? Where's your battalion staff? Back to the book, John's explained.

1453
01:56:57.76 --> 01:57:06.76
And as he did, he reviewed in his mind all that had happened in the short 30 days since the first attack in the boy to Bretel.

1454
01:57:06.76 --> 01:57:10.76
His whole forward staff was gone.

1455
01:57:10.76 --> 01:57:18.76
Newcome, Sadler, Carter, and McCarthy dead. Weddle and Hoffman wounded.

1456
01:57:18.76 --> 01:57:27.76
Grimsel, out-commanding a company, Nab, Ryan, Todd, Stoen, Cordiac, Kenny, and Dettman all wounded.

1457
01:57:27.76 --> 01:57:33.76
Besides, God knew how many other officers he had never even known by name.

1458
01:57:33.76 --> 01:57:42.76
The company commanders from four companies killed or wounded mostly in the space of seven short action packed days.

1459
01:57:42.76 --> 01:57:48.76
He stopped talking a while. He fought for a moment of all those fine people.

1460
01:57:48.76 --> 01:57:53.76
When he glanced up, catching himself, he thought he was looking at a ghost.

1461
01:57:53.76 --> 01:58:01.76
There stood Kenny. The shadow on his face wavering as the candle flickered in the faint breeze of his entry, so Kenny had been wounded and now he's back.

1462
01:58:01.76 --> 01:58:07.76
In an instant, his troubles, his preoccupation with the relieving officers, or forgotten.

1463
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:10.76
Kenny, he cried. When in God's name are you doing here?

1464
01:58:10.76 --> 01:58:16.76
Well, Major, I heard you got into town all right, but we're sort of short-a-comedy commanders.

1465
01:58:16.76 --> 01:58:23.76
I saw Todd, Dettman, and Cordiac back there, so I thought I'd better get on up here and see if I could do anything.

1466
01:58:23.76 --> 01:58:30.76
The docs will let you go these days if you can stand up straight for two minutes without falling down.

1467
01:58:30.76 --> 01:58:34.76
The major saw that Kenny was exhausted and spite of his cheerful attitude.

1468
01:58:34.76 --> 01:58:44.76
He found out later that he had walked alone in the dark all the way from the division clearing station, several miles to the rear, in order to get back to the battalion.

1469
01:58:44.76 --> 01:58:50.76
His legs and back were covered with bandages under his new shirt and pants.

1470
01:58:50.76 --> 01:58:55.76
He said, well, old man, there is anything you can do right now.

1471
01:58:55.76 --> 01:59:01.76
These nice people have just come in, so we're going to be out of this rat trap in a little while.

1472
01:59:01.76 --> 01:59:03.76
You just go back behind.

1473
01:59:03.76 --> 01:59:07.76
Mrs. Blanchette here and lie down and get some rest.

1474
01:59:07.76 --> 01:59:08.76
You need it.

1475
01:59:08.76 --> 01:59:11.76
Kenny did as he was told.

1476
01:59:11.76 --> 01:59:18.76
The strain had begun to bend even his indelimentable will.

1477
01:59:18.76 --> 01:59:28.76
At 0-440, the major reported to regimen that the 134th Infantry had taken over.

1478
01:59:28.76 --> 01:59:36.76
The wiremen took out the phone, the major shook hands and said goodbye and good luck to the new arrivals.

1479
01:59:36.76 --> 01:59:41.76
Then he and Kenny followed the company's down the hill.

1480
01:59:41.76 --> 01:59:56.76
Just seven days ago, they had numbered 800. They were now only 450 proud, tired men, the clay pigeons who had taken the core objective.

1481
01:59:56.76 --> 02:00:23.76
The clay pigeons and from Omaha Beach to the Elb, the first battalion in 115th Infantry 29th Division, had

1482
02:00:23.76 --> 02:00:35.76
2,384 casualties, including 454 men, killed in action.

1483
02:00:35.76 --> 02:00:39.76
That's hard to even fathom.

1484
02:00:39.76 --> 02:00:51.76
Again, think about the fact that at this time, a battalion was about 900 men and they'd taken 2,384 casualties.

1485
02:00:51.76 --> 02:00:56.76
All the replacements that came and kept getting wounded.

1486
02:00:56.76 --> 02:00:59.76
Unbelievable.

1487
02:00:59.76 --> 02:01:07.76
You got to read this book and get the lessons learned.

1488
02:01:07.76 --> 02:01:12.76
You get lessons learned from that book.

1489
02:01:12.76 --> 02:01:20.76
You can also get some of major John's lessons learned from Colonel David Hacworth in his book,

1490
02:01:20.76 --> 02:01:29.76
about face and what you want to talk about some layers, some historical layers, check this out.

1491
02:01:29.76 --> 02:01:40.76
In about face, Hacworth talks about what happens in August 13th, 1961.

1492
02:01:40.76 --> 02:01:48.76
The communist in Berlin started stringing Bard wire and they were now going to build a wall between East and West Berlin.

1493
02:01:48.76 --> 02:01:58.76
They were the candidate who was president wanted to do something like, you can't just, we need to make some kind of a statement here.

1494
02:01:58.76 --> 02:02:06.76
He sent 1500 soldiers from the first battle group of the 8th Infantry Division.

1495
02:02:06.76 --> 02:02:12.76
They were selected apparently by Kennedy, by name.

1496
02:02:12.76 --> 02:02:20.76
So Kennedy said, I want these guys in the recent is because their commander was a guy named Glover S. Johns.

1497
02:02:20.76 --> 02:02:27.76
And he wanted them to go and reinforce the British French and American troops who were on the ground in Berlin.

1498
02:02:27.76 --> 02:02:37.76
And then, layers, Colonel Johns, in his position, appointed D company.

1499
02:02:37.76 --> 02:02:46.76
In his battle group, he appointed D company to be the battle group's reaction force.

1500
02:02:46.76 --> 02:02:49.76
And who was the commander of D company?

1501
02:02:49.76 --> 02:03:03.76
It was a young, Korean war veteran who had come back into the army named Captain at the time, David Hacworth.

1502
02:03:03.76 --> 02:03:13.76
And as I said, Hacworth points to Glover Johns as his primary source for leadership lessons learned.

1503
02:03:13.76 --> 02:03:21.76
And he captured them coming succinctly from Glover Johns himself in about face.

1504
02:03:21.76 --> 02:03:30.76
So let's take it back to that book for a minute here.

1505
02:03:30.76 --> 02:03:33.76
From about face.

1506
02:03:33.76 --> 02:03:39.76
All too soon, Colonel Johns received orders back to Berlin as chief of intelligence.

1507
02:03:39.76 --> 02:03:48.76
So now this whole thing that they'd gone through with sending this force to reinforce the French British and American troops on the ground in Berlin.

1508
02:03:48.76 --> 02:03:50.76
This is pretty much done.

1509
02:03:50.76 --> 02:03:55.76
All too soon, Colonel Johns received orders back to Berlin as chief of intelligence.

1510
02:03:55.76 --> 02:03:59.76
Most of us had known the magic couldn't last forever.

1511
02:03:59.76 --> 02:04:02.76
But it didn't change the fact that we were incredibly sad to see him go.

1512
02:04:02.76 --> 02:04:10.76
On 15 January 1962, the battle group fell out smartly for its final review before our favorite soldier.

1513
02:04:10.76 --> 02:04:15.76
The weather was bitterly cold, but no one noticed.

1514
02:04:15.76 --> 02:04:22.76
We were all too busy standing tall and greedily soaking in the Colonel's farewell address.

1515
02:04:22.76 --> 02:04:28.76
Johns was a leader who taught by example, so most of the points he made weren't exactly new to us.

1516
02:04:28.76 --> 02:04:42.76
But to hear it in a single speech, this great man's basic philosophy of soldiering was like being led on letting in on the secret ingredients of some magical formula.

1517
02:04:42.76 --> 02:04:45.76
To wit.

1518
02:04:45.76 --> 02:04:50.76
Strive to do small things as well.

1519
02:04:50.76 --> 02:04:53.76
Be a doer and a self-starter.

1520
02:04:53.76 --> 02:05:03.76
Aggressiveness and initiative are two most admired qualities in a leader, but you also must put your feet up and think.

1521
02:05:03.76 --> 02:05:06.76
So there's a little dichotomy he's hitting on.

1522
02:05:06.76 --> 02:05:09.76
Yeah, you got to be aggressive, but you got to think.

1523
02:05:09.76 --> 02:05:16.76
Strive for self-improvement through constant self-avaluation.

1524
02:05:16.76 --> 02:05:20.76
Got to be humble.

1525
02:05:20.76 --> 02:05:22.76
Never be satisfied.

1526
02:05:22.76 --> 02:05:28.76
Ask of any project how can it be done better.

1527
02:05:28.76 --> 02:05:32.76
Don't over-inspect or over-supervised.

1528
02:05:32.76 --> 02:05:38.76
Allow your leaders to make mistakes in training so they can profit from the errors and not make them in combat.

1529
02:05:38.76 --> 02:05:52.76
Descentualized command. Keep the troops informed. Telling them what, how and why builds their confidence.

1530
02:05:52.76 --> 02:05:56.76
The harder the training, the more the troops will brag.

1531
02:05:56.76 --> 02:06:01.76
Remember that guy that asked last podcast? How do I improve them around of a group?

1532
02:06:01.76 --> 02:06:04.76
Get them to have pride?

1533
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:06.76
Train hard.

1534
02:06:06.76 --> 02:06:18.76
Next, enthusiasm, fairness, and moral and physical courage for of the most important aspects of leadership.

1535
02:06:18.76 --> 02:06:22.76
enthusiasm, fairness, and moral and physical courage.

1536
02:06:22.76 --> 02:06:28.76
Next, showmanship, a vital technique of leadership.

1537
02:06:28.76 --> 02:06:30.76
That's interesting.

1538
02:06:30.76 --> 02:06:40.76
Once you've, in about face hackworth, he specifies some of these things that he would that that

1539
02:06:40.76 --> 02:06:46.76
Glover Johns would do, showmanship wise. He'd walked down the range and he was a really good shot with a rifle.

1540
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:50.76
And apparently he would have a guy throw a quarter.

1541
02:06:50.76 --> 02:06:54.76
Like a coin up in the air and he'd shoot it.

1542
02:06:54.76 --> 02:06:56.76
Because he was such a good shot.

1543
02:06:56.76 --> 02:07:00.76
And another thing he did, he's about to give a speech somewhere.

1544
02:07:00.76 --> 02:07:08.76
And in sort of a mixed audience, but a bunch of German sort of political people.

1545
02:07:08.76 --> 02:07:14.76
Glover Johns gets up and just gives the speech in German.

1546
02:07:14.76 --> 02:07:24.76
All right, next, the ability to speak and write well to essential tools of leadership.

1547
02:07:24.76 --> 02:07:28.76
Boom.

1548
02:07:28.76 --> 02:07:32.76
Next, there is a salient difference between profanity and obscenity.

1549
02:07:32.76 --> 02:07:40.76
While a leader employees profanity tempered with discretion, he never uses obscenities.

1550
02:07:40.76 --> 02:07:46.76
Next, have consideration for others.

1551
02:07:46.76 --> 02:07:48.76
Hmm.

1552
02:07:48.76 --> 02:07:52.76
Next, yelling detracts from your dignity.

1553
02:07:52.76 --> 02:07:56.76
Take your men aside and counsel them.

1554
02:07:56.76 --> 02:08:00.76
Next, understand and use judgment.

1555
02:08:00.76 --> 02:08:04.76
No when to stop fighting for something you believe is right.

1556
02:08:04.76 --> 02:08:14.76
Discuss and argue your point of view until a decision is made, and then support the decision wholeheartedly.

1557
02:08:14.76 --> 02:08:18.76
Last, stay ahead of your boss.

1558
02:08:18.76 --> 02:08:28.76
When Johns had finished Colonel Cowch gave the order to pass in review, and company by company we marched by with just that little extra precision.

1559
02:08:28.76 --> 02:08:36.76
Our shoes, uniforms, and brass earlier attended to to provide just that little extra sparkle.

1560
02:08:36.76 --> 02:08:46.76
As was the custom of the company commanders peeled off after their units passed in the review stand, and congregated for final goodbye.

1561
02:08:46.76 --> 02:08:50.76
Johns had watched the parade with tears in his eyes.

1562
02:08:50.76 --> 02:08:56.76
The tears remained as he stood at attention.

1563
02:08:56.76 --> 02:09:10.76
So tears in his eyes.

1564
02:09:10.76 --> 02:09:16.76
That is major, Glover Johns. That is the clay pigeons.

1565
02:09:16.76 --> 02:09:20.76
That is the first Battalion, 115th Infantry, 29th Division.

1566
02:09:20.76 --> 02:09:30.76
And obviously he is an example of leadership.

1567
02:09:30.76 --> 02:09:38.76
And the men of his battalion, the clay pigeons, they are yet another example.

1568
02:09:38.76 --> 02:09:50.76
Yet another example of the indelminible warrior spirit and culture.

1569
02:09:50.76 --> 02:09:58.76
That is the very core of this nation.

1570
02:09:58.76 --> 02:10:02.76
Don't forget that.

1571
02:10:02.76 --> 02:10:08.76
Don't forget that culture. Don't ever forget it.

1572
02:10:08.76 --> 02:10:30.76
And for those of you out there right now defending our nation, that spirit and that culture, it can work to hold you up.

1573
02:10:30.76 --> 02:10:42.76
And having it in your brain can keep you strong in trying times, but there is also a dichotomy there,

1574
02:10:42.76 --> 02:10:50.76
because not only does that warrior spirit and warrior culture hold you up.

1575
02:10:50.76 --> 02:10:56.76
You also have to hold it up.

1576
02:10:56.76 --> 02:11:14.76
You have to maintain that warrior culture in the way you think and in the way you act.

1577
02:11:14.76 --> 02:11:24.76
And if you ever start to forget how you are supposed to think and how you are supposed to act,

1578
02:11:24.76 --> 02:11:42.76
remember Colonel Glover Johns and the clay pigeons of St. Lowe.

1579
02:11:42.76 --> 02:11:48.76
And I think that is a lot of got for tonight echo Charles.

1580
02:11:48.76 --> 02:12:10.76
So I guess speaking of maintaining, yes, maybe you could tell us how we could maintain support of this podcast, if you, if you want.

1581
02:12:10.76 --> 02:12:20.76
And for ourselves, it would fire for effect.

1582
02:12:20.76 --> 02:12:28.76
And you're watching your calling, your artillery, your calling, naval gunfire, or your calling air support.

1583
02:12:28.76 --> 02:12:32.76
And you're trying to get them to hit this target, whatever that target might be.

1584
02:12:32.76 --> 02:12:36.76
That's trying to get them to hit a building where there's moose.

1585
02:12:36.76 --> 02:12:40.76
And they get a direct hit. Now you say fire for effect.

1586
02:12:40.76 --> 02:12:44.76
Yeah. That means you're needing to make any more adjustments. You can just start hammering that thing.

1587
02:12:44.76 --> 02:12:46.76
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1588
02:12:46.76 --> 02:12:50.76
So when somebody does something on target, you like you have fire for it.

1589
02:12:50.76 --> 02:12:56.76
I got you. Oh, thank you. Okay. I think that's one of those ones that you know, I, I hear all you, you and life always say it.

1590
02:12:56.76 --> 02:13:02.76
And you know, certain, do we say that much? No, not that much, but that's where we're here.

1591
02:13:02.76 --> 02:13:08.76
Kind of come out. And you know, certain terms, if you're not familiar with them, you can kind of gather what it means.

1592
02:13:08.76 --> 02:13:14.76
Yeah, you know, in the context of the original words and stuff like that. But that one I never could really figure out exactly what that means.

1593
02:13:14.76 --> 02:13:20.76
As opposed to, you know, I don't know, fire at will or, you know, all these other things that you hear.

1594
02:13:20.76 --> 02:13:22.76
Yeah, fire for effect.

1595
02:13:22.76 --> 02:13:26.76
Fire for effect. Because it could, it kind of sounds like it could mean like to distract them or something.

1596
02:13:26.76 --> 02:13:30.76
To have some effect other than hitting the target or something like that.

1597
02:13:30.76 --> 02:13:36.76
Yeah, apparently not after it apparently it's the opposite and you know, so good.

1598
02:13:36.76 --> 02:13:40.76
Yeah, it's amazing. You show them up at least these guys, man. Yeah.

1599
02:13:40.76 --> 02:13:46.76
Yeah. And, and I'm telling you, like, and I've said this before, that thread of,

1600
02:13:46.76 --> 02:13:56.76
and I actually don't like using the word or your culture, because it's so overused.

1601
02:13:56.76 --> 02:14:04.76
And it's, it's, it's, it's been so degraded by this horrible meaningless things.

1602
02:14:04.76 --> 02:14:08.76
Oh, that guy's a warrior. You know what I mean? Because he, you know,

1603
02:14:08.76 --> 02:14:12.76
you know, dex and what he made it a crime and actually survived his prison term.

1604
02:14:12.76 --> 02:14:16.76
Yeah, because we were warrior. No, actually you're not. Yeah.

1605
02:14:16.76 --> 02:14:22.76
You know, different. But, but there's no other word that I can put on it.

1606
02:14:22.76 --> 02:14:28.76
But, at least that I could think of right now when you talk about the American culture.

1607
02:14:28.76 --> 02:14:31.76
And it's so easy because America's a big place.

1608
02:14:31.76 --> 02:14:34.76
And America's got a lot of good things going for it.

1609
02:14:34.76 --> 02:14:42.76
And a lot like, you know, the culture of art in America's massive, the culture of music is,

1610
02:14:42.76 --> 02:14:50.76
is unbelievably powerful here. The culture of education and academia.

1611
02:14:50.76 --> 02:15:00.76
All these things are massive in America. Right? And, and it's really easy to forget the culture,

1612
02:15:00.76 --> 02:15:05.76
this, the most, in my mind, the most powerful culture that we have.

1613
02:15:05.76 --> 02:15:10.76
Wow, I could be wrong. Oh, I mean, what about our entrepreneurial spirit and culture? Right?

1614
02:15:10.76 --> 02:15:11.76
That's huge here.

1615
02:15:11.76 --> 02:15:12.76
Very strong.

1616
02:15:12.76 --> 02:15:14.76
Our capitalist culture.

1617
02:15:14.76 --> 02:15:16.76
We want to make money.

1618
02:15:16.76 --> 02:15:18.76
We want to grow. We want to do things, right?

1619
02:15:18.76 --> 02:15:20.76
Those are all really, really powerful.

1620
02:15:20.76 --> 02:15:24.76
And I think we tend to forget.

1621
02:15:24.76 --> 02:15:26.76
We tend to forget.

1622
02:15:26.76 --> 02:15:30.76
We want to say that, you know, the Japanese Beshido culture is this thing.

1623
02:15:30.76 --> 02:15:32.76
We should look up to guess what?

1624
02:15:32.76 --> 02:15:33.76
Guess what?

1625
02:15:33.76 --> 02:15:37.76
That Beshido culture versus the US Marines.

1626
02:15:37.76 --> 02:15:43.76
You know, storming beaches in heavily defended beaches.

1627
02:15:43.76 --> 02:15:44.76
And that, that guess what?

1628
02:15:44.76 --> 02:15:45.76
Yeah.

1629
02:15:45.76 --> 02:15:47.76
The American warrior culture?

1630
02:15:47.76 --> 02:15:49.76
That's, that's the real deal.

1631
02:15:49.76 --> 02:15:50.76
Yeah.

1632
02:15:50.76 --> 02:15:51.76
That's the real deal.

1633
02:15:51.76 --> 02:15:54.76
The Nazis? Oh, the stormtroopers? Oh, yeah.

1634
02:15:54.76 --> 02:15:57.76
Those who are such a warrior culture. Guess what?

1635
02:15:57.76 --> 02:15:59.76
Compare them to these guys?

1636
02:15:59.76 --> 02:16:00.76
Yeah.

1637
02:16:00.76 --> 02:16:01.76
No, not happening.

1638
02:16:01.76 --> 02:16:02.76
Sorry.

1639
02:16:02.76 --> 02:16:04.76
Yeah.

1640
02:16:04.76 --> 02:16:07.76
Yeah, these, and you hear this a lot like that.

1641
02:16:07.76 --> 02:16:10.76
There is a little part in the book where the guy got his legs blown off.

1642
02:16:10.76 --> 02:16:11.76
Or something like that.

1643
02:16:11.76 --> 02:16:13.76
And he was like, I'll be back.

1644
02:16:13.76 --> 02:16:13.76
Yeah.

1645
02:16:13.76 --> 02:16:14.76
I'll be back.

1646
02:16:14.76 --> 02:16:16.76
He's like, and it, it really seemed like he was,

1647
02:16:16.76 --> 02:16:17.76
you wasn't pissed about his legs.

1648
02:16:17.76 --> 02:16:19.76
He used piss that he's out of the game.

1649
02:16:19.76 --> 02:16:22.76
I'm like, guys down, I'm going, you know.

1650
02:16:22.76 --> 02:16:23.76
Yeah.

1651
02:16:23.76 --> 02:16:28.76
I think a lot of times in, you know, America is kind of one, in example, where.

1652
02:16:28.76 --> 02:16:32.76
You know, when all things are going real good, it's easy to point out the things that are not going good.

1653
02:16:32.76 --> 02:16:38.76
You know, like, you're, whatever the case may be, like, when everything's perfect,

1654
02:16:38.76 --> 02:16:43.76
the little imperfections show themselves more, you know, like, if your life is like,

1655
02:16:43.76 --> 02:16:45.76
everything's together, we're,

1656
02:16:45.76 --> 02:16:48.76
you know, your job is good and your family's good or whatever,

1657
02:16:48.76 --> 02:16:51.76
but meanwhile, like, you're, I don't know, your front lawn is going brown.

1658
02:16:51.76 --> 02:16:54.76
You're like, my front lawn's going brown, you know, is like that kind of thing.

1659
02:16:54.76 --> 02:16:57.76
I think that's what we have in the US.

1660
02:16:57.76 --> 02:17:01.76
It's kind of like, we, things are really good.

1661
02:17:01.76 --> 02:17:05.76
I think it's, I think it's more just a matter of percentage.

1662
02:17:05.76 --> 02:17:07.76
I mean, I think in America right now, it's like,

1663
02:17:07.76 --> 02:17:10.76
one percent of the population is actually in the military.

1664
02:17:10.76 --> 02:17:13.76
I mean, all these world war two veterans,

1665
02:17:13.76 --> 02:17:16.76
not many of them left, the Vietnam veterans are getting older,

1666
02:17:16.76 --> 02:17:20.76
Korean veterans are very, very rare at this point.

1667
02:17:20.76 --> 02:17:22.76
So, and what are our movies about?

1668
02:17:22.76 --> 02:17:25.76
You know, instead of making movies about Saint Low,

1669
02:17:25.76 --> 02:17:29.76
they make movies about the aliens attacking or whatever, you know,

1670
02:17:29.76 --> 02:17:34.76
so we just, it's pretty easy to forget that the reason we're here

1671
02:17:34.76 --> 02:17:39.76
and the reason we're not speaking German is when the reason we're not speaking Japanese

1672
02:17:39.76 --> 02:17:45.76
is because of this warrior culture here, which kind of,

1673
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:47.76
it's right up there.

1674
02:17:47.76 --> 02:17:48.76
It's right up.

1675
02:17:48.76 --> 02:17:50.76
These show me any warrior culture that has the same,

1676
02:17:50.76 --> 02:17:52.76
that, you know, I know there's a equivalent.

1677
02:17:52.76 --> 02:17:55.76
I know that there's other, I know there's other military units in the world.

1678
02:17:55.76 --> 02:17:58.76
And other countries that have a proud military tradition as well.

1679
02:17:58.76 --> 02:18:01.76
But, you know, obviously I'm biased towards mine.

1680
02:18:01.76 --> 02:18:07.76
But, we're, you tell me any historical unit that you say,

1681
02:18:07.76 --> 02:18:10.76
oh, these guys were Spartans and they were the real warriors.

1682
02:18:10.76 --> 02:18:15.76
You know, you haven't really spent much time with a 19-year-old Marine.

1683
02:18:15.76 --> 02:18:16.76
Yeah.

1684
02:18:16.76 --> 02:18:22.76
You haven't spent much time with a, with a, with a soldier from an airborne division.

1685
02:18:22.76 --> 02:18:24.76
You just, you just, you gotta meet those guys.

1686
02:18:24.76 --> 02:18:25.76
Yeah.

1687
02:18:25.76 --> 02:18:26.76
I'm telling you.

1688
02:18:26.76 --> 02:18:28.76
They're the real deal.

1689
02:18:28.76 --> 02:18:29.76
Yeah.

1690
02:18:29.76 --> 02:18:33.76
And no matter what kind of, you know, historical warrior,

1691
02:18:33.76 --> 02:18:35.76
you want to throw out there.

1692
02:18:35.76 --> 02:18:38.76
I'll put my Americans against the head to head.

1693
02:18:38.76 --> 02:18:44.76
It just in terms of just straight up warrior culture and spirit.

1694
02:18:44.76 --> 02:18:45.76
Yeah.

1695
02:18:45.76 --> 02:18:47.76
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go toe to toe.

1696
02:18:47.76 --> 02:18:48.76
I'll go toe to toe.

1697
02:18:48.76 --> 02:18:49.76
For sure.

1698
02:18:49.76 --> 02:18:51.76
I'm not, I'm not trying to say we're better.

1699
02:18:51.76 --> 02:18:52.76
Yeah.

1700
02:18:52.76 --> 02:18:53.76
But I'll go toe to toe with Spartans.

1701
02:18:53.76 --> 02:18:54.76
Yeah.

1702
02:18:54.76 --> 02:18:55.76
I'll go toe to toe with them.

1703
02:18:55.76 --> 02:18:59.76
And I'm just talking, you know, my warrior culture

1704
02:18:59.76 --> 02:19:01.76
against your warrior culture and the way you live your life.

1705
02:19:01.76 --> 02:19:04.76
You go meet some of these young soldiers and Marines out there.

1706
02:19:04.76 --> 02:19:05.76
Yeah.

1707
02:19:05.76 --> 02:19:08.76
You can come and talk me in and special operations, guys.

1708
02:19:08.76 --> 02:19:09.76
You know what I mean?

1709
02:19:09.76 --> 02:19:10.76
Obviously.

1710
02:19:10.76 --> 02:19:12.76
Come and get some.

1711
02:19:12.76 --> 02:19:13.76
Yeah, man.

1712
02:19:13.76 --> 02:19:14.76
I do get.

1713
02:19:16.76 --> 02:19:18.76
Come in, fire for effect.

1714
02:19:18.76 --> 02:19:19.76
Sorry, Brad.

1715
02:19:19.76 --> 02:19:20.76
I do it.

1716
02:19:20.76 --> 02:19:22.76
It's, I just learned the word I'm trying to hit it in.

1717
02:19:22.76 --> 02:19:25.76
Warrior culture doesn't get through all of America.

1718
02:19:25.76 --> 02:19:27.76
You know.

1719
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:32.76
Nonetheless, we are down to support ourselves.

1720
02:19:32.76 --> 02:19:37.76
I was going to make some wise crack about Hawaii, but you know, yeah, you might, you

1721
02:19:37.76 --> 02:19:38.76
might get done with it.

1722
02:19:38.76 --> 02:19:46.76
No, not going to do that because, but no, because, uh, massive, there's a, there's a, there's a great book that somebody sent me.

1723
02:19:46.76 --> 02:19:53.76
And it's about Japanese Americans that formed up, you know, we sent American sent,

1724
02:19:53.76 --> 02:19:58.76
just many Japanese to intern and camps in America in World War II.

1725
02:19:58.76 --> 02:20:01.76
They also took a bunch of them and turned them into a fighting unit.

1726
02:20:01.76 --> 02:20:02.76
Put the 440 seconds.

1727
02:20:02.76 --> 02:20:03.76
Yes.

1728
02:20:03.76 --> 02:20:15.76
And they were, they might be the most highly decorated unit of their, of that size, because they, but a lot of them came from Hawaii.

1729
02:20:15.76 --> 02:20:16.76
Yeah.

1730
02:20:16.76 --> 02:20:17.76
Yeah.

1731
02:20:17.76 --> 02:20:18.76
So huge Japanese community in Hawaii.

1732
02:20:18.76 --> 02:20:19.76
Yeah.

1733
02:20:19.76 --> 02:20:20.76
Yeah.

1734
02:20:20.76 --> 02:20:21.76
Yeah.

1735
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:24.76
And speaking of Hawaii, like Kay, you know, like the,

1736
02:20:24.76 --> 02:20:25.76
And Warrior culture.

1737
02:20:25.76 --> 02:20:26.76
Yeah.

1738
02:20:26.76 --> 02:20:27.76
You for sure.

1739
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:27.76
Yeah.

1740
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:29.76
So you, and I love their just straight-up say BJP.

1741
02:20:29.76 --> 02:20:32.76
And they're now, and my boy Max Holloway, by the way.

1742
02:20:32.76 --> 02:20:33.76
By the way, you're in Champ.

1743
02:20:33.76 --> 02:20:34.76
Yeah.

1744
02:20:34.76 --> 02:20:39.76
My remember when Max came in train with us, I've told you, I'm a little bit man, what a, what a beast.

1745
02:20:39.76 --> 02:20:40.76
Yeah.

1746
02:20:40.76 --> 02:20:43.76
He, you know what, he was trained in hard.

1747
02:20:43.76 --> 02:20:44.76
Yeah.

1748
02:20:44.76 --> 02:20:45.76
He was trained hard.

1749
02:20:45.76 --> 02:20:46.76
He wasn't even close to the UFC yet.

1750
02:20:46.76 --> 02:20:47.76
This was the years ago.

1751
02:20:47.76 --> 02:20:48.76
It wasn't close to UFC yet.

1752
02:20:48.76 --> 02:20:50.76
It hits Warrior culture and him.

1753
02:20:50.76 --> 02:20:51.76
Yeah.

1754
02:20:51.76 --> 02:20:52.76
Get some super nice guy too.

1755
02:20:52.76 --> 02:20:57.76
When you, when you can sit or, like, even, let's say the Spartans, and you consider all their

1756
02:20:57.76 --> 02:21:03.76
things, stop, this is like hand to hand sword to neck battles, just like dang that's, that's savage.

1757
02:21:03.76 --> 02:21:07.76
But back in those days, look at all kinds of cultures.

1758
02:21:07.76 --> 02:21:09.76
So consider Hawaiian culture.

1759
02:21:09.76 --> 02:21:12.76
If you look at the weapons, like you can look like in the museum, just go online, whatever.

1760
02:21:12.76 --> 02:21:17.76
Look at the weapons that they used in battle and then consider, like, that's what you got to use.

1761
02:21:17.76 --> 02:21:18.76
It's like savage man.

1762
02:21:18.76 --> 02:21:19.76
Yeah.

1763
02:21:19.76 --> 02:21:24.76
So yeah, there, there are a lot of legitimate Warrior cultures.

1764
02:21:24.76 --> 02:21:28.76
But it's different.

1765
02:21:28.76 --> 02:21:30.76
There's no doubt.

1766
02:21:30.76 --> 02:21:32.76
And what I'm saying to encapsulate what I'm saying is America has won.

1767
02:21:32.76 --> 02:21:32.76
Yeah.

1768
02:21:32.76 --> 02:21:33.76
Yeah.

1769
02:21:33.76 --> 02:21:34.76
We're told to tell with any.

1770
02:21:34.76 --> 02:21:34.76
Yeah.

1771
02:21:34.76 --> 02:21:35.76
Don't slip.

1772
02:21:35.76 --> 02:21:36.76
And sleep on that.

1773
02:21:38.76 --> 02:21:41.76
So, support.

1774
02:21:41.76 --> 02:21:42.76
Support wise.

1775
02:21:42.76 --> 02:21:45.76
I'm going to shift gears here.

1776
02:21:45.76 --> 02:21:48.76
So, you know, I'm talking about kettlebells all the time.

1777
02:21:48.76 --> 02:21:49.76
I feel like I'm talking about kettle.

1778
02:21:49.76 --> 02:21:50.76
Not just now.

1779
02:21:50.76 --> 02:21:52.76
I feel like I talk about kettlebells a lot.

1780
02:21:52.76 --> 02:21:54.76
It's one of those things.

1781
02:21:54.76 --> 02:21:59.76
You know how like you go from thing to thing and you're like, hey, I've been to go to one thing on me.

1782
02:21:59.76 --> 02:22:00.76
Yeah, yeah.

1783
02:22:00.76 --> 02:22:01.76
You go from thing to thing.

1784
02:22:01.76 --> 02:22:06.76
Well, you know, try to acquire knowledge and what you call skills.

1785
02:22:06.76 --> 02:22:08.76
Capabilities will say capabilities.

1786
02:22:08.76 --> 02:22:09.76
That's important.

1787
02:22:09.76 --> 02:22:11.76
Participation is required.

1788
02:22:11.76 --> 02:22:15.76
kettlebells is kind of like a thing that I recently got into.

1789
02:22:15.76 --> 02:22:17.76
And I'm going to be honest with you.

1790
02:22:17.76 --> 02:22:19.76
You can kind of get out of them.

1791
02:22:19.76 --> 02:22:22.76
Yeah.

1792
02:22:22.76 --> 02:22:23.76
I'm going to go into numbers.

1793
02:22:23.76 --> 02:22:24.76
Whatever.

1794
02:22:24.76 --> 02:22:27.76
So, my metcon was.

1795
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:28.76
Is with was.

1796
02:22:28.76 --> 02:22:30.76
I'll do 135.

1797
02:22:30.76 --> 02:22:33.76
Clean and press.

1798
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:34.76
Okay.

1799
02:22:34.76 --> 02:22:35.76
Okay.

1800
02:22:35.76 --> 02:22:36.76
Press is like just pressing.

1801
02:22:36.76 --> 02:22:37.76
Yeah.

1802
02:22:37.76 --> 02:22:39.76
Jerk is kind of like you jerk your body kind of thing.

1803
02:22:39.76 --> 02:22:40.76
Okay.

1804
02:22:40.76 --> 02:22:41.76
So, it's clean jerk.

1805
02:22:41.76 --> 02:22:43.76
With 135.

1806
02:22:43.76 --> 02:22:44.76
Yeah.

1807
02:22:44.76 --> 02:22:45.76
The wheels.

1808
02:22:45.76 --> 02:22:46.76
Uh.

1809
02:22:46.76 --> 02:22:47.76
Five.

1810
02:22:47.76 --> 02:22:48.76
And then to burpees.

1811
02:22:48.76 --> 02:22:49.76
And then to 10.

1812
02:22:49.76 --> 02:22:50.76
And then to 40.

1813
02:22:50.76 --> 02:22:51.76
And that's just a lot of weight.

1814
02:22:51.76 --> 02:22:54.76
So,

1815
02:22:54.76 --> 02:22:56.76
I don't know.

1816
02:22:56.76 --> 02:22:57.76
It's about.

1817
02:22:57.76 --> 02:23:00.76
Eight sets would be, like a solid one.

1818
02:23:00.76 --> 02:23:00.76
Yeah.

1819
02:23:00.76 --> 02:23:01.76
It's a wide one.

1820
02:23:01.76 --> 02:23:02.76
You just widening the 30 second walk.

1821
02:23:02.76 --> 02:23:03.76
By the way.

1822
02:23:03.76 --> 02:23:04.76
It's like a recovery.

1823
02:23:04.76 --> 02:23:07.76
It's like, it's like your breathing that's what.

1824
02:23:07.76 --> 02:23:08.76
Okay.

1825
02:23:08.76 --> 02:23:09.76
So it helps.

1826
02:23:09.76 --> 02:23:09.76
Wait.

1827
02:23:09.76 --> 02:23:10.76
Why shouldn't I do that?

1828
02:23:10.76 --> 02:23:11.76
I know.

1829
02:23:11.76 --> 02:23:12.76
You're going to 5.5.

1830
02:23:12.76 --> 02:23:13.76
5.5.

1831
02:23:13.76 --> 02:23:14.76
5.

1832
02:23:14.76 --> 02:23:15.76
5.

1833
02:23:15.76 --> 02:23:16.76
5.

1834
02:23:16.76 --> 02:23:17.76
Okay.

1835
02:23:17.76 --> 02:23:20.24
Well, I don't want to do that. Well, it might die.

1836
02:23:20.24 --> 02:23:22.000
Contest wouldn't be to go longer.

1837
02:23:22.72 --> 02:23:25.04
Well, whoever stops the rhythm.

1838
02:23:26.16 --> 02:23:29.84
I'm saying that the rest is part of the, here's the goal that's why.

1839
02:23:31.12 --> 02:23:34.48
Well, let me ask, yes, how long is it taking like 30 seconds to do?

1840
02:23:34.48 --> 02:23:36.48
Does it take 30 seconds to do the five and five?

1841
02:23:36.48 --> 02:23:38.64
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no more than 30.

1842
02:23:39.28 --> 02:23:40.64
So you do five cleaner press?

1843
02:23:40.64 --> 02:23:41.04
Right.

1844
02:23:41.36 --> 02:23:42.64
Boom five burpees.

1845
02:23:42.64 --> 02:23:43.84
Yeah, it's more than 30 seconds.

1846
02:23:43.84 --> 02:23:45.36
Okay, maybe 45 at the most.

1847
02:23:45.36 --> 02:23:47.20
Yeah, maybe 45.

1848
02:23:47.20 --> 02:23:48.20
I don't know.

1849
02:23:48.20 --> 02:23:49.20
That's a good question.

1850
02:23:49.20 --> 02:23:50.20
It's 130 though.

1851
02:23:50.20 --> 02:23:51.60
Okay, well, I guess it might be alright.

1852
02:23:51.60 --> 02:23:53.20
So you put that on a timer though.

1853
02:23:53.20 --> 02:23:56.04
You should be saying like a minute 30, I'd rest for 30 to 30.

1854
02:23:56.04 --> 02:23:57.68
You should be like, okay, I'm doing it.

1855
02:23:57.68 --> 02:24:03.32
Oh, because you're saying like the tabot, like, yeah, what you should do, you should do a minute 30 seconds.

1856
02:24:03.32 --> 02:24:07.28
And every minute and 30 seconds, you do the five and five.

1857
02:24:07.28 --> 02:24:08.28
Okay.

1858
02:24:08.28 --> 02:24:12.84
So that way you get, because by the six set, you'll be tired when you're starting it.

1859
02:24:12.84 --> 02:24:13.84
But you don't want to rest more.

1860
02:24:13.84 --> 02:24:14.84
Yeah, push yourself.

1861
02:24:14.84 --> 02:24:20.000
This is kind of my thought, my thought process on it is I'm going to do a certain kind

1862
02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.52
of work capacity, you know, like a five reps of this and five reps of this.

1863
02:24:24.52 --> 02:24:29.52
And then I'm going to have a kind of an active recovery period walking.

1864
02:24:29.52 --> 02:24:30.52
Yeah.

1865
02:24:30.52 --> 02:24:31.52
And here's the thing.

1866
02:24:31.52 --> 02:24:33.12
And here's kind of the goal.

1867
02:24:33.12 --> 02:24:34.12
This is good.

1868
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:35.60
I actually, I actually am going back on what I said.

1869
02:24:35.60 --> 02:24:39.44
I think this is actually not a bad idea because, but you need to put, it's like when

1870
02:24:39.44 --> 02:24:43.10
I do something else, you stuff on the minute, what makes me nervous about what you're

1871
02:24:43.10 --> 02:24:44.80
saying is like, I like rest for about 30 seconds.

1872
02:24:44.80 --> 02:24:46.48
No, I don't know what that means.

1873
02:24:46.48 --> 02:24:47.48
Okay.

1874
02:24:47.48 --> 02:24:52.28
Because because that could be 40 seconds, that could also be, you got a clock on.

1875
02:24:52.28 --> 02:24:53.28
Yes.

1876
02:24:53.28 --> 02:24:54.28
Okay.

1877
02:24:54.28 --> 02:24:55.28
That's 100%.

1878
02:24:55.28 --> 02:24:56.28
Yeah.

1879
02:24:56.28 --> 02:24:59.48
So here's the weird thing, but having a clock, every since I started lifting, rest

1880
02:24:59.48 --> 02:25:05.20
between sets has been a critical part of my lifting routine from the beginning, rest

1881
02:25:05.20 --> 02:25:08.56
between two, because it's just what I learned in stuff like that.

1882
02:25:08.56 --> 02:25:16.12
So I don't think the clock in actual clock is not been a part of a workout ever.

1883
02:25:16.12 --> 02:25:17.12
It's part of the way.

1884
02:25:17.12 --> 02:25:18.12
It's like wait.

1885
02:25:18.12 --> 02:25:19.12
There's a date.

1886
02:25:19.12 --> 02:25:20.44
Just like you're lifting those weights.

1887
02:25:20.44 --> 02:25:21.44
That's what the weights are for.

1888
02:25:21.44 --> 02:25:22.44
Right.

1889
02:25:22.44 --> 02:25:23.44
They are going to rest in between sets.

1890
02:25:23.44 --> 02:25:24.44
That's what the clock is for.

1891
02:25:24.44 --> 02:25:26.84
You can't just go wheeling, wheeling, wheeling, wheeling, wheeling, just to whatever.

1892
02:25:26.84 --> 02:25:27.84
That's good.

1893
02:25:27.84 --> 02:25:28.84
And that's just my philosophy.

1894
02:25:28.84 --> 02:25:33.88
If I'm not on the clock of one hour workout for me, it would take like two hours.

1895
02:25:33.88 --> 02:25:34.88
Yeah.

1896
02:25:34.88 --> 02:25:36.88
Because I'll just, I'll just be thinking about something.

1897
02:25:36.88 --> 02:25:39.64
Or I'll just take more rest than I should have taken or whatever.

1898
02:25:39.64 --> 02:25:40.64
Yeah.

1899
02:25:40.64 --> 02:25:41.64
And consider this.

1900
02:25:41.64 --> 02:25:44.36
If you're doing, let's say you're doing five sets of squats.

1901
02:25:44.36 --> 02:25:46.12
Five sets of, I don't know, eight will say.

1902
02:25:46.12 --> 02:25:51.92
And when you're pushing on your second set, you can do more weight than or less weight

1903
02:25:51.92 --> 02:25:53.44
than on your first set.

1904
02:25:53.44 --> 02:25:55.52
If you rest for less time.

1905
02:25:55.52 --> 02:25:56.52
You're right.

1906
02:25:56.52 --> 02:25:59.20
So if you rest for five minutes, you can do way more.

1907
02:25:59.20 --> 02:26:00.20
Yeah.

1908
02:26:00.20 --> 02:26:02.96
So that's putting your body through something different than if you would have just rested

1909
02:26:02.96 --> 02:26:03.96
less.

1910
02:26:03.96 --> 02:26:06.80
So it just depends on what you're trying to put your body through, what you can recover

1911
02:26:06.80 --> 02:26:07.80
from all kinds of results.

1912
02:26:07.80 --> 02:26:13.000
We want to go through this one of the hardest workouts is, and this isn't, this is

1913
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.96
an dysmonicals freedom field, maybe.

1914
02:26:16.96 --> 02:26:22.48
I used to do the 20 reps squat workout, which is you take a weight that you can do

1915
02:26:22.48 --> 02:26:24.08
10 times and you do it 20 times.

1916
02:26:24.08 --> 02:26:25.08
Okay.

1917
02:26:25.08 --> 02:26:26.08
I know.

1918
02:26:26.08 --> 02:26:29.36
And it's devastatingly hard.

1919
02:26:29.36 --> 02:26:32.36
And I would rest for 20 minutes.

1920
02:26:32.36 --> 02:26:33.72
And then I would do it again.

1921
02:26:33.72 --> 02:26:36.48
And then I would rest for 20 minutes and I would do it again.

1922
02:26:36.48 --> 02:26:38.48
So you said to that.

1923
02:26:38.48 --> 02:26:39.48
Yeah.

1924
02:26:39.48 --> 02:26:40.48
That is.

1925
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:41.48
Okay.

1926
02:26:41.48 --> 02:26:44.04
So, so technique and I believe you, I'm not saying it's easy.

1927
02:26:44.04 --> 02:26:45.36
I'm not saying that.

1928
02:26:45.36 --> 02:26:49.44
But that being said, technically that's impossible.

1929
02:26:49.44 --> 02:26:50.44
Technically.

1930
02:26:50.44 --> 02:26:51.44
Yes, you're right.

1931
02:26:51.44 --> 02:26:54.08
It is impossible to do something and you're going to do 10 times, it's 20 times.

1932
02:26:54.08 --> 02:26:55.08
20 times.

1933
02:26:55.08 --> 02:26:56.08
20 times.

1934
02:26:56.08 --> 02:26:58.12
If you can do the weight that you've done for him for 20 times, that's the way you

1935
02:26:58.12 --> 02:26:59.12
can do for 20 times.

1936
02:26:59.12 --> 02:27:00.12
Yeah, you're straight.

1937
02:27:00.12 --> 02:27:01.12
That's not 10.

1938
02:27:01.12 --> 02:27:02.12
So I get it.

1939
02:27:02.12 --> 02:27:03.12
Yeah, yeah.

1940
02:27:03.12 --> 02:27:06.44
But I'm not going to, I'm not going to, you're right.

1941
02:27:06.44 --> 02:27:08.08
But you also understand what I'm talking about.

1942
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:11.48
And I exactly were talking about you're like a normal, like you're not maxing out

1943
02:27:11.48 --> 02:27:13.92
at 10 reps with this weight.

1944
02:27:13.92 --> 02:27:17.64
It's like, this is my normal, maybe if I'm going to do a set of 10 or so.

1945
02:27:17.64 --> 02:27:23.88
It will be surprised that the weight you can get, like, let's say, you know, you picked

1946
02:27:23.88 --> 02:27:26.68
the right weight that you can, like I do this 10 times.

1947
02:27:26.68 --> 02:27:27.68
Yeah.

1948
02:27:27.68 --> 02:27:28.68
Legitimate.

1949
02:27:28.68 --> 02:27:29.68
And then you're like, you know what?

1950
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:31.68
I'm going to do it 20 times.

1951
02:27:31.68 --> 02:27:32.68
I know what.

1952
02:27:32.68 --> 02:27:33.68
I didn't say.

1953
02:27:33.68 --> 02:27:34.68
I did it.

1954
02:27:34.68 --> 02:27:35.68
You're right.

1955
02:27:35.68 --> 02:27:37.04
It's a knowledge kind of situation.

1956
02:27:37.04 --> 02:27:42.24
Like when you say, I'm going to do a weight 20 times, what I can, you know, say for

1957
02:27:42.24 --> 02:27:43.24
lack of a better turn.

1958
02:27:43.24 --> 02:27:44.24
You're normally detained.

1959
02:27:44.24 --> 02:27:45.24
But it's not normal also.

1960
02:27:45.24 --> 02:27:49.40
You're like, you're basically, you're resting as much as a human being can rest with

1961
02:27:49.40 --> 02:27:52.44
a bunch of weight on their back in between reps.

1962
02:27:52.44 --> 02:27:55.12
When you get to rep 12, you're taken like time.

1963
02:27:55.12 --> 02:27:58.32
But it's, it's, it's a really, it's a losing proposition.

1964
02:27:58.32 --> 02:28:01.88
Because while you're waiting there, resting, you're actually suffering.

1965
02:28:01.88 --> 02:28:02.88
Yeah.

1966
02:28:02.88 --> 02:28:03.88
You're back start to get old.

1967
02:28:03.88 --> 02:28:04.88
Yeah.

1968
02:28:04.88 --> 02:28:04.88
Yeah.

1969
02:28:04.88 --> 02:28:08.76
That's what overhead squats are brutal because you're not resting in an overhead

1970
02:28:08.76 --> 02:28:09.76
squat position.

1971
02:28:09.76 --> 02:28:11.48
And it's like awkward.

1972
02:28:11.48 --> 02:28:13.48
And yeah, that's hard.

1973
02:28:13.48 --> 02:28:15.20
The overhead squat situation.

1974
02:28:15.20 --> 02:28:17.000
But and not to be to dead horse here.

1975
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.64
So like consider if you said, hey, someone who's pretty new, more or less to working out,

1976
02:28:21.64 --> 02:28:24.68
say, hey, get a weight you can do for 10 and do it 20.

1977
02:28:24.68 --> 02:28:26.24
They're going to mess up in one way.

1978
02:28:26.24 --> 02:28:27.24
Tip probably.

1979
02:28:27.24 --> 02:28:29.44
They're going to be like, okay, I can do this 10 times.

1980
02:28:29.44 --> 02:28:30.44
I know that.

1981
02:28:30.44 --> 02:28:31.44
And I'm going to try to do 20.

1982
02:28:31.44 --> 02:28:34.84
They can't even get to get 20 because you said the way that they could do for 10.

1983
02:28:34.84 --> 02:28:35.68
They try for 20.

1984
02:28:35.68 --> 02:28:36.84
They feel it 10.

1985
02:28:36.84 --> 02:28:38.20
That's how much they can do for 10.

1986
02:28:38.20 --> 02:28:39.40
Or they'll go the other way.

1987
02:28:39.40 --> 02:28:43.28
They'll be like, you will go get a, and they'll be like, wait, I got to do this 20 times.

1988
02:28:43.28 --> 02:28:44.28
Yeah.

1989
02:28:44.28 --> 02:28:45.28
Yeah.

1990
02:28:45.28 --> 02:28:46.28
I can do this.

1991
02:28:46.28 --> 02:28:47.28
I can do the bar 10 times.

1992
02:28:47.28 --> 02:28:48.28
So I'll just use the bar.

1993
02:28:48.28 --> 02:28:49.28
Kind of thing.

1994
02:28:49.28 --> 02:28:53.48
So you have that knowledge where you, you're like, hey, I know the weight that I can do for 10.

1995
02:28:53.48 --> 02:28:54.48
And it'll be hard.

1996
02:28:54.48 --> 02:28:56.000
But you know what, I'm going to get nuts.

1997
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.12
And if I really push myself, I can get 20.

1998
02:28:58.12 --> 02:28:59.12
Guess what?

1999
02:28:59.12 --> 02:29:00.12
I'm using that weight.

2000
02:29:00.12 --> 02:29:01.84
So you kind of have that because you've been training time.

2001
02:29:01.84 --> 02:29:02.84
It's like getting it.

2002
02:29:02.84 --> 02:29:03.84
Yeah, you're right.

2003
02:29:03.84 --> 02:29:08.20
And I don't think I'll ever do that, even though I kind of considered it last time you

2004
02:29:08.20 --> 02:29:13.08
mentioned it, but then when I got in the workout room, I was like, yeah, I don't, I don't

2005
02:29:13.08 --> 02:29:14.48
think I'll ever do that.

2006
02:29:14.48 --> 02:29:15.48
Maybe I will.

2007
02:29:15.48 --> 02:29:16.48
I don't know.

2008
02:29:16.48 --> 02:29:19.44
Actually, I'll tell you what I will do is someone online, maybe it was you.

2009
02:29:19.44 --> 02:29:22.68
Someone was saying 100 burpees in 10 minutes.

2010
02:29:22.68 --> 02:29:23.68
10 minutes.

2011
02:29:23.68 --> 02:29:24.68
Was that you saying?

2012
02:29:24.68 --> 02:29:25.68
Yeah.

2013
02:29:25.68 --> 02:29:26.68
And Brandon just texted me yesterday.

2014
02:29:26.68 --> 02:29:27.68
Brandon.

2015
02:29:27.68 --> 02:29:28.68
Brandon.

2016
02:29:28.68 --> 02:29:29.68
Yeah.

2017
02:29:29.68 --> 02:29:30.68
He said he's going to do it.

2018
02:29:30.68 --> 02:29:32.28
I was considering I'm going to do it in the first time.

2019
02:29:32.28 --> 02:29:33.28
Not that hard.

2020
02:29:33.28 --> 02:29:35.68
I'm surprised that Brandon is a good shape.

2021
02:29:35.68 --> 02:29:39.88
You've ever seen he posts like pictures himself doing these crazy push-up workouts.

2022
02:29:39.88 --> 02:29:40.88
Yeah.

2023
02:29:40.88 --> 02:29:41.88
I can't believe he can't do it.

2024
02:29:41.88 --> 02:29:42.88
That's why I'm so surprised.

2025
02:29:42.88 --> 02:29:43.88
This is what all you do.

2026
02:29:43.88 --> 02:29:44.88
He does weird.

2027
02:29:44.88 --> 02:29:47.28
He does good creative push-up drills.

2028
02:29:47.28 --> 02:29:49.16
Does weird creative push-up drills.

2029
02:29:49.16 --> 02:29:50.16
Like, well, I don't know.

2030
02:29:50.16 --> 02:29:51.16
He doing weird stuff.

2031
02:29:51.16 --> 02:29:52.88
He puts his hands up here over there.

2032
02:29:52.88 --> 02:29:53.88
Yeah, that's awkward.

2033
02:29:53.88 --> 02:29:54.88
Yeah, I totally good.

2034
02:29:54.88 --> 02:29:57.60
Yeah, because you ever trade like, I got good at push-ups on.

2035
02:29:57.60 --> 02:30:00.36
I was like, yeah, I'm still pretty solid at push-ups.

2036
02:30:00.36 --> 02:30:03.24
But you trade to a push-up with, you know, like, I just didn't.

2037
02:30:03.24 --> 02:30:04.76
He's like, oh, this is way off.

2038
02:30:04.76 --> 02:30:06.12
It's kind of like, good to be back to what we were saying.

2039
02:30:06.12 --> 02:30:07.28
It's like, what you used to.

2040
02:30:07.28 --> 02:30:08.56
What you're doing in your own muscular.

2041
02:30:08.56 --> 02:30:10.000
Speaking of what we were saying.

2042
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.80
We're saying there's something about gallblows.

2043
02:30:12.80 --> 02:30:13.80
Yeah.

2044
02:30:13.80 --> 02:30:14.80
I mean, very quickly.

2045
02:30:14.80 --> 02:30:16.000
I usually kind of wrap up right now.

2046
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Yeah.

2047
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.80
Then you started talking to another crazy squad.

2048
02:30:19.80 --> 02:30:20.80
That's what I'm not.

2049
02:30:20.80 --> 02:30:24.20
That's what you know what is my fault.

2050
02:30:24.20 --> 02:30:25.20
Next time I won't tell you anything.

2051
02:30:25.20 --> 02:30:26.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I see.

2052
02:30:26.80 --> 02:30:27.80
I see what you did there.

2053
02:30:27.80 --> 02:30:30.44
Look, you took blame.

2054
02:30:30.44 --> 02:30:32.44
And you told me what you're going to do to fix it.

2055
02:30:32.44 --> 02:30:34.68
Dang, extreme ownership.

2056
02:30:34.68 --> 02:30:35.68
In effect.

2057
02:30:35.68 --> 02:30:36.68
Also, okay, wait.

2058
02:30:36.68 --> 02:30:37.68
What were we talking about?

2059
02:30:37.68 --> 02:30:38.96
Oh, yeah, I'm in Ticketabels now.

2060
02:30:38.96 --> 02:30:39.96
Yeah.

2061
02:30:39.96 --> 02:30:41.76
And you want to say where you should get your kettlebells.

2062
02:30:41.76 --> 02:30:43.52
I'm not saying that's the way where you should.

2063
02:30:43.52 --> 02:30:44.80
I'm saying where I got them.

2064
02:30:44.80 --> 02:30:47.40
And if you want, you can kettlebells anywhere.

2065
02:30:47.40 --> 02:30:48.24
Where?

2066
02:30:48.24 --> 02:30:49.08
Really?

2067
02:30:49.08 --> 02:30:50.08
What about cool kettlebells?

2068
02:30:50.08 --> 02:30:52.96
Whoa, that's a different story, my friend.

2069
02:30:52.96 --> 02:30:55.36
Anyway, I got mine from on it.

2070
02:30:55.36 --> 02:30:57.08
I'm not even saying get the cool kettlebells.

2071
02:30:57.08 --> 02:31:02.08
I'm saying go to onit.com slashjockel.

2072
02:31:02.08 --> 02:31:03.32
Look at the kettlebells.

2073
02:31:03.32 --> 02:31:04.32
You like those kettlebells?

2074
02:31:04.32 --> 02:31:05.72
If you're going to get into kettlebells,

2075
02:31:05.72 --> 02:31:09.04
or if you're already currently into kettlebells,

2076
02:31:09.04 --> 02:31:10.88
get some of those if you like them.

2077
02:31:10.88 --> 02:31:11.72
I like them.

2078
02:31:11.72 --> 02:31:14.04
I got one, the small one.

2079
02:31:14.04 --> 02:31:15.48
It's called howler.

2080
02:31:15.48 --> 02:31:16.52
A little howler monkey.

2081
02:31:18.76 --> 02:31:19.36
I think it's a monkey.

2082
02:31:19.36 --> 02:31:21.04
Anyway, howler monkey.

2083
02:31:21.04 --> 02:31:23.12
kettlebell, it's like, I want to say 18 pounds.

2084
02:31:23.12 --> 02:31:23.96
What's 0.5?

2085
02:31:25.96 --> 02:31:27.16
Eight pounds.

2086
02:31:27.16 --> 02:31:29.000
I'm pretty 16 pounds.

2087
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.16
Yeah, no, no, no, 16 kilos, I think.

2088
02:31:31.16 --> 02:31:32.68
I'm sorry, 16 kilos, yeah.

2089
02:31:32.68 --> 02:31:33.68
Yeah.

2090
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:36.88
So, yeah, so eight kilos, 16 pounds.

2091
02:31:36.88 --> 02:31:38.88
You ever take 17, 18 pounds?

2092
02:31:38.88 --> 02:31:40.88
Anyway, I got one of those from my daughter.

2093
02:31:40.88 --> 02:31:43.40
So my nephew comes visit, he's 11.

2094
02:31:43.40 --> 02:31:44.56
Not into working out.

2095
02:31:44.56 --> 02:31:45.56
We'll just say that.

2096
02:31:45.56 --> 02:31:46.56
Yeah.

2097
02:31:46.56 --> 02:31:47.40
It is now.

2098
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:48.40
Is now, yeah.

2099
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:49.96
So I'm like, you know, he's one of these kids.

2100
02:31:49.96 --> 02:31:53.24
He's like, you know, he's into math and whatnot.

2101
02:31:53.24 --> 02:31:54.92
So I'm working out all the time.

2102
02:31:54.92 --> 02:31:58.52
I never really thought until someone made me kind of suggested it to say,

2103
02:31:58.52 --> 02:32:01.04
hey, we've come work out with me, you know?

2104
02:32:01.04 --> 02:32:04.88
The tell him come work out and he kind of caught him at the end where it was met

2105
02:32:04.88 --> 02:32:05.88
content.

2106
02:32:05.88 --> 02:32:09.48
And he was, and I was like, hey, come work out because I saw him, you know?

2107
02:32:09.48 --> 02:32:11.60
And he's like, yeah, he's like cool.

2108
02:32:11.60 --> 02:32:14.24
He immediately do by the way, be surprised.

2109
02:32:14.24 --> 02:32:15.24
I'm not surprised.

2110
02:32:15.24 --> 02:32:16.24
Yeah, man.

2111
02:32:16.24 --> 02:32:17.24
I'm not surprised.

2112
02:32:17.24 --> 02:32:18.24
It's easy.

2113
02:32:18.24 --> 02:32:19.24
Working out.

2114
02:32:19.24 --> 02:32:19.96
They're like, man, I want to be like that.

2115
02:32:19.96 --> 02:32:20.96
Yeah.

2116
02:32:20.96 --> 02:32:22.96
You know, in their hands, when you were a kid, remember you saw somebody

2117
02:32:22.96 --> 02:32:23.96
I was all yoked.

2118
02:32:23.96 --> 02:32:24.96
Like, he did.

2119
02:32:24.96 --> 02:32:25.96
How do I do that?

2120
02:32:25.96 --> 02:32:27.48
It's the whole reason I work out to be honest with you.

2121
02:32:27.48 --> 02:32:29.48
Like, remember the show of American gladiators.

2122
02:32:29.48 --> 02:32:30.48
Remember the show?

2123
02:32:30.48 --> 02:32:32.64
It was not from when I was a kid.

2124
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:33.64
Yeah, no, no.

2125
02:32:33.64 --> 02:32:35.40
I didn't watch the way you were a parent.

2126
02:32:35.40 --> 02:32:36.64
Yeah, I was watching that.

2127
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:38.80
I was like, bro, I want to be American gladiators.

2128
02:32:38.80 --> 02:32:42.12
Because they were, it was like, because there were the mix between these big, kind

2129
02:32:42.12 --> 02:32:44.72
of almost like, bullies, not bullies, like, ugly people.

2130
02:32:44.72 --> 02:32:48.08
But they were like, you know, when you play video game, you come against the boss who

2131
02:32:48.08 --> 02:32:50.000
you look at him, you're like, I can't beat this guy.

2132
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I can't beat him.

2133
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.72
But you're a normal character, whatever.

2134
02:32:52.72 --> 02:32:53.56
And then they end up winning.

2135
02:32:53.56 --> 02:32:55.56
That's what American gladiators was in real life.

2136
02:32:55.56 --> 02:32:57.40
And I was like, dang, that's American gladiators.

2137
02:32:57.40 --> 02:33:00.60
They're money, because they're athletic too.

2138
02:33:00.60 --> 02:33:02.44
I was like, man, I'd watch it.

2139
02:33:02.44 --> 02:33:03.44
I'd do a bunch of push-ups.

2140
02:33:03.44 --> 02:33:04.44
I was in like six creators.

2141
02:33:04.44 --> 02:33:06.44
I was like, yeah, it's a whole reason.

2142
02:33:06.44 --> 02:33:09.36
Anyway, I think a lot of kids have that in their mind, especially the boys.

2143
02:33:09.36 --> 02:33:10.36
For sure.

2144
02:33:10.36 --> 02:33:11.36
In one way or another.

2145
02:33:11.36 --> 02:33:13.000
So I was like, hey, come workout with me.

2146
02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.44
And he was like, you're like, okay.

2147
02:33:14.44 --> 02:33:15.44
Put the time this phone.

2148
02:33:15.44 --> 02:33:16.44
Yeah, he was on the phone.

2149
02:33:16.44 --> 02:33:17.44
Night and more.

2150
02:33:17.44 --> 02:33:19.04
Oh, little uncle Jake's scenario.

2151
02:33:19.04 --> 02:33:20.44
Uncle Jake 100%.

2152
02:33:20.44 --> 02:33:22.04
I was uncle Jake at that time.

2153
02:33:22.04 --> 02:33:24.36
But, yeah, nephew is there.

2154
02:33:24.36 --> 02:33:25.68
This is actually used to be to me.

2155
02:33:25.68 --> 02:33:26.68
I was in prison.

2156
02:33:26.68 --> 02:33:27.84
In the last, he comes.

2157
02:33:27.84 --> 02:33:29.000
I teach him the form.

2158
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.40
And kids kind of have good form.

2159
02:33:30.40 --> 02:33:31.40
Or he did.

2160
02:33:31.40 --> 02:33:32.40
Because they're flexible.

2161
02:33:32.40 --> 02:33:33.40
Yeah, they're flexible.

2162
02:33:33.40 --> 02:33:36.72
They haven't fallen into improper patterns.

2163
02:33:36.72 --> 02:33:39.08
Maybe like a Deltaver or something, maybe.

2164
02:33:39.08 --> 02:33:40.08
I don't know.

2165
02:33:40.08 --> 02:33:41.08
That's just a guess.

2166
02:33:41.08 --> 02:33:43.80
But anyway, so I'm like, you know, just the basic kettlebell swing.

2167
02:33:43.80 --> 02:33:46.000
I say, I say, this is what you're going to do.

2168
02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Do it.

2169
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I'll do it.

2170
02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.44
I'll show you how give little tips or whatever.

2171
02:33:49.44 --> 02:33:50.44
It wasn't perfect for me.

2172
02:33:50.44 --> 02:33:54.000
First, you adjust and you could do it.

2173
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.36
Not that kind of all the way up or nothing, just a basic.

2174
02:33:56.36 --> 02:33:57.68
All right.

2175
02:33:57.68 --> 02:33:58.92
And my daughter happened to be there.

2176
02:33:58.92 --> 02:34:00.28
And so she knows about burpees.

2177
02:34:00.28 --> 02:34:03.36
So I was like, okay, what we're going to do is you're going to do kettlebell swings

2178
02:34:03.36 --> 02:34:04.36
five.

2179
02:34:04.36 --> 02:34:05.72
And then you're going to do burpees.

2180
02:34:05.72 --> 02:34:07.40
And they're going to walk for 30 seconds, basically.

2181
02:34:07.40 --> 02:34:08.40
Yeah.

2182
02:34:08.40 --> 02:34:10.68
But he's doing the kettlebell swings rather than the cleaner press.

2183
02:34:10.68 --> 02:34:12.76
So then you're going to do burpees.

2184
02:34:12.76 --> 02:34:16.000
Burpees is just jump down, do a pushup, and then jump up in there.

2185
02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.000
That's a burpee.

2186
02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
So he does it.

2187
02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I was like, well, you don't want you transition from standing to push up.

2188
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.12
There's some wiggle room there for air.

2189
02:34:23.12 --> 02:34:25.72
So I tell my daughter, hey, demonstrate.

2190
02:34:25.72 --> 02:34:26.72
She does she's four.

2191
02:34:26.72 --> 02:34:27.72
She can do it pretty good.

2192
02:34:27.72 --> 02:34:28.72
Too bad.

2193
02:34:28.72 --> 02:34:29.72
So she does it.

2194
02:34:29.72 --> 02:34:31.24
And of course, he can do it.

2195
02:34:31.24 --> 02:34:32.72
She's a little girl, so he does it.

2196
02:34:32.72 --> 02:34:33.72
Makes adjustment boom.

2197
02:34:33.72 --> 02:34:34.72
He's good to go.

2198
02:34:34.72 --> 02:34:35.72
He's ready.

2199
02:34:35.72 --> 02:34:39.08
So I'm going to fire it out because mine's about to be super hard like it normally is.

2200
02:34:39.08 --> 02:34:41.44
And he's like, you could tell he's getting fired up too.

2201
02:34:41.44 --> 02:34:43.20
You know, so I set the clock and we go.

2202
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:46.24
And his was kind of easy to be honest with you because the kettlebell swings are too

2203
02:34:46.24 --> 02:34:47.24
the way to the.

2204
02:34:47.24 --> 02:34:48.24
Yeah.

2205
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:50.24
And boom, they did the whole thing.

2206
02:34:50.24 --> 02:34:52.16
And he's also adding afterwards, you know.

2207
02:34:52.16 --> 02:34:55.68
And he's the kind where he doesn't do that kind of stuff.

2208
02:34:55.68 --> 02:34:57.96
But you could tell he was super fired up.

2209
02:34:57.96 --> 02:34:59.48
And you know what he said next.

2210
02:34:59.48 --> 02:35:03.000
What he said afterwards, he's like, hey, next time you work out, can you let me know?

2211
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
There you go.

2212
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Straight up.

2213
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
That was a good thing.

2214
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Uncle Echo's in the house.

2215
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
In the house, man.

2216
02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.000
In the house.

2217
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Yeah.

2218
02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
She went to book about that.

2219
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Yeah.

2220
02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Maybe I will.

2221
02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.000
You're going to be the best book ever.

2222
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.000
All right.

2223
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.000
For kids.

2224
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Next.

2225
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Anyway.

2226
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Kind of a little.

2227
02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
It's good on it.

2228
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000
They have a lot of good stuff.

2229
02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000
You've done battle ropes before.

2230
02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Yes.

2231
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:25.000
You have.

2232
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
They were in some random GMI was at the time.

2233
02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.80
I was like, I've seen people doing this.

2234
02:35:28.80 --> 02:35:29.80
I want to do some of them.

2235
02:35:29.80 --> 02:35:30.80
Yeah.

2236
02:35:30.80 --> 02:35:33.52
They're like big ropes in the, I guess that's a good exercise.

2237
02:35:33.52 --> 02:35:35.92
I had never done them before, but I was considering that.

2238
02:35:35.92 --> 02:35:36.92
That's awesome on there.

2239
02:35:36.92 --> 02:35:37.92
You know what?

2240
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:38.92

And before you tweet me and tell me a good book that I should do on the podcast.

2265
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.80
Check and see if I've already done it.

2266
02:36:23.80 --> 02:36:24.80
Yeah.

2267
02:36:24.80 --> 02:36:26.56
It's like what, like 60 books.

2268
02:36:26.56 --> 02:36:27.56
Yeah.

2269
02:36:27.56 --> 02:36:29.56
And a lot of really good books that everyone knows.

2270
02:36:29.56 --> 02:36:33.68
But if you haven't listened to the podcast and then you're telling me to cover with

02:36:33.68 --> 02:36:37.88
the old breed by Eugene Sledge or whatever.

2272
02:36:37.88 --> 02:36:41.20
Just so a lot of times people tell me to cover books that have already been on there.

2273
02:36:41.20 --> 02:36:42.20
Yeah.

2274
02:36:42.20 --> 02:36:45.04
So then I got to go and figure out which podcast I was so I can tell you to go and listen

2275
02:36:45.04 --> 02:36:49.28
to podcasts, you know, 10, which is with the old breed by Eugene Sledge.

2276
02:36:49.28 --> 02:36:50.28
There you go.

2277
02:36:50.28 --> 02:36:51.28
I think.

2278
02:36:51.28 --> 02:36:52.28
Yeah, something like that.

2279
02:36:52.28 --> 02:36:53.92
Yeah, hey, you want to check that out.

2280
02:36:53.92 --> 02:36:55.96
Like I said, it's all there by episode.

2281
02:36:55.96 --> 02:36:56.96
Yeah.

2282
02:36:56.96 --> 02:36:58.32
And if you want a book, a reading list for me.

2283
02:36:58.32 --> 02:36:59.32
That's my reading list.

2284
02:36:59.32 --> 02:37:00.32
That's it.

2285
02:37:00.32 --> 02:37:01.32
Yeah.

2286
02:37:01.32 --> 02:37:02.32
There's no other books.

2287
02:37:02.32 --> 02:37:04.36
If a book is good and I read it, it's been on the podcast.

2288
02:37:04.36 --> 02:37:06.20
And I'll do you one better.

2289
02:37:06.20 --> 02:37:09.88
Because I have a small reading list that I added to that list.

2290
02:37:09.88 --> 02:37:11.36
Oh, that's only one book.

2291
02:37:11.36 --> 02:37:12.36
But I'm just saying.

2292
02:37:12.36 --> 02:37:13.36
Where's it mine game?

2293
02:37:13.36 --> 02:37:14.36
Mine game.

2294
02:37:14.36 --> 02:37:15.36
Yes.

2295
02:37:15.36 --> 02:37:16.36
Power, Michael Powell.

2296
02:37:16.36 --> 02:37:17.36
You know, that's the easy read.

2297
02:37:17.36 --> 02:37:21.28
It's kind of like the field manual, a small little version, different subject book.

2298
02:37:21.28 --> 02:37:22.20
None the last.

2299
02:37:22.20 --> 02:37:24.80
It's not like the field manual, dude.

2300
02:37:24.80 --> 02:37:27.16
I read it, but I know not.

2301
02:37:27.16 --> 02:37:28.44
No, no, no, no.

2302
02:37:28.44 --> 02:37:29.44
Probably not.

2303
02:37:29.44 --> 02:37:32.04
Anyway, it's far supporting.

2304
02:37:32.04 --> 02:37:33.44
Get your books through there.

2305
02:37:33.44 --> 02:37:35.24
Click through it goes to Amazon.

2306
02:37:35.24 --> 02:37:36.24
You shop Amazon.

2307
02:37:36.24 --> 02:37:37.84
Like we all do anyway.

2308
02:37:37.84 --> 02:37:38.84
Right?

2309
02:37:38.84 --> 02:37:42.92
So when you get these books, like I said, listed by episode, click through there.

2310
02:37:42.92 --> 02:37:45.32
And if you're doing another shopping, hey, feel free.

2311
02:37:45.32 --> 02:37:51.16
You know, when you click through there, that's a small little action.

2312
02:37:51.16 --> 02:37:52.16
Be agree action.

2313
02:37:52.16 --> 02:37:55.60
You can start supporting those, you know, kind of like, you know, when you throw sodium

2314
02:37:55.60 --> 02:37:57.60
metal in water, you know?

2315
02:37:57.60 --> 02:37:58.60
Oh, I know.

2316
02:37:58.60 --> 02:38:00.76
Yeah, you know for, I haven't said it for a long time.

2317
02:38:00.76 --> 02:38:04.16
So I'm going to say it now, just to remind everybody, when you throw sodium metal in

2318
02:38:04.16 --> 02:38:06.32
water, it explodes big, huge.

2319
02:38:06.32 --> 02:38:08.48
I learned that in chemistry class.

2320
02:38:08.48 --> 02:38:12.48
My chemistry teacher's name is Mr. Bigelow, by the way.

2321
02:38:12.48 --> 02:38:13.48
Koi High School.

2322
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:14.72
Barker in the day.

2323
02:38:14.72 --> 02:38:19.52
Anyway, also good way to support, subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, and Google

2324
02:38:19.52 --> 02:38:24.32
Play and other places that they do podcast and leave a review.

2325
02:38:24.32 --> 02:38:25.32
Leave a review.

2326
02:38:25.32 --> 02:38:28.92
Here's a, if you feel like, yeah, that's really good.

2327
02:38:28.92 --> 02:38:34.32
I like reading the reviews, but yeah, if you feel like leaving one, apparently it's like

2328
02:38:34.32 --> 02:38:35.32
it helps.

2329
02:38:35.32 --> 02:38:36.32
Oh, yeah.

2330
02:38:36.32 --> 02:38:37.32
If you have stuff, I don't know.

2331
02:38:37.32 --> 02:38:38.32
Yeah, good.

2332
02:38:38.32 --> 02:38:39.32
Yeah, good.

2333
02:38:39.32 --> 02:38:40.32
And that's great.

2334
02:38:40.32 --> 02:38:41.32
For sure, that's great.

2335
02:38:41.32 --> 02:38:42.32
Yeah, no, helpful.

2336
02:38:42.32 --> 02:38:43.32
Spreads it.

2337
02:38:43.32 --> 02:38:44.32
Yeah.

2338
02:38:44.32 --> 02:38:44.32
What does it do?

2339
02:38:44.32 --> 02:38:45.32
Spread the word.

2340
02:38:45.32 --> 02:38:46.32
I think ultimately, that's the benefit.

2341
02:38:46.32 --> 02:38:54.08
You know, when I see our jockel podcast on, you know, number, whatever, where it appears

2342
02:38:54.08 --> 02:38:57.60
like between one and 10 in the business section, that is good.

2343
02:38:57.60 --> 02:38:59.48
That's cool.

2344
02:38:59.48 --> 02:39:04.96
But really, the tangible benefit for the message is spreading the word.

2345
02:39:04.96 --> 02:39:08.20
People, if they get turned onto it, it improves everybody's life really.

2346
02:39:08.20 --> 02:39:12.20
Because if you improve your life in all these ways, it improves like your improvement

2347
02:39:12.20 --> 02:39:14.08
is a direct effect on my improvement.

2348
02:39:14.08 --> 02:39:15.84
Because I hang around with you.

2349
02:39:15.84 --> 02:39:17.48
So that's kind of how it's.

2350
02:39:17.48 --> 02:39:19.28
So that's really the benefit.

2351
02:39:19.28 --> 02:39:23.76
So if you want to help spread the word, you can write a review.

2352
02:39:23.76 --> 02:39:27.36
And if you want to give feedback about the podcast, that's a good place to do.

2353
02:39:27.36 --> 02:39:29.16
Yeah, I think that's, and let's face it.

2354
02:39:29.16 --> 02:39:31.60
When you leave a review, especially the ones that everyone leaves.

2355
02:39:31.60 --> 02:39:32.88
Because people are kind of fun.

2356
02:39:32.88 --> 02:39:33.88
That's pretty fun.

2357
02:39:33.88 --> 02:39:37.28
And people aren't people people like take time in the reviews.

2358
02:39:37.28 --> 02:39:38.76
You know, a good podcast.

2359
02:39:38.76 --> 02:39:39.76
Yeah.

2360
02:39:39.76 --> 02:39:40.76
Well, actually, sometimes they do say that.

2361
02:39:40.76 --> 02:39:41.76
That's good.

2362
02:39:41.76 --> 02:39:42.76
Yeah.

2363
02:39:42.76 --> 02:39:43.76
And position.

2364
02:39:43.76 --> 02:39:46.76
Yeah.

2365
02:39:46.76 --> 02:39:47.76
Yeah.

2366
02:39:47.76 --> 02:39:48.76
That's how it's.

2367
02:39:48.76 --> 02:39:49.76
Layers.

2368
02:39:49.76 --> 02:39:50.76
Layers in the review.

2369
02:39:50.76 --> 02:39:51.76
Right there.

2370
02:39:51.76 --> 02:39:52.76
There.

2371
02:39:52.76 --> 02:39:53.76
I'm telling you.

2372
02:39:53.76 --> 02:39:56.76
But anyway, if you're in the mood, leave a review.

2373
02:39:56.76 --> 02:39:58.76
As long as you're honest, that's the main thing.

2374
02:39:58.76 --> 02:40:00.16
And get colorful with it.

2375
02:40:00.16 --> 02:40:02.76
If you want, those are actually the fun ones.

2376
02:40:02.76 --> 02:40:04.76
Like I said, leave a review.

2377
02:40:04.76 --> 02:40:05.76
Yeah, sure.

2378
02:40:05.76 --> 02:40:06.76
If you feel like it.

2379
02:40:06.76 --> 02:40:07.76
Subscribe to the YouTube.

2380
02:40:07.76 --> 02:40:08.76
We have YouTube.

2381
02:40:08.76 --> 02:40:10.76
If you didn't know, everyone knows I think.

2382
02:40:10.76 --> 02:40:11.76
Yeah.

2383
02:40:11.76 --> 02:40:12.76
Yeah, because we see it all the time.

2384
02:40:12.76 --> 02:40:14.76
But in the event of this being the first time.

2385
02:40:14.76 --> 02:40:15.76
Subscribe to it then.

2386
02:40:15.76 --> 02:40:19.76
Why wouldn't someone subscribe to it?

2387
02:40:19.76 --> 02:40:22.76
If I were a person who, oh, wait.

2388
02:40:22.76 --> 02:40:24.76
If you're listening to the podcast, it makes sense.

2389
02:40:24.76 --> 02:40:25.76
Yeah.

2390
02:40:25.76 --> 02:40:28.76
I don't know how many reasons there would ever be to not subscribe to you.

2391
02:40:28.76 --> 02:40:30.76
If you hear it, this is like what's the reason.

2392
02:40:30.76 --> 02:40:31.76
I listen to podcasts.

2393
02:40:31.76 --> 02:40:32.76
It's audio.

2394
02:40:32.76 --> 02:40:33.76
I look.

2395
02:40:33.76 --> 02:40:38.76
I go to YouTube and I only watch people playing first person shooter video games.

2396
02:40:38.76 --> 02:40:39.76
You know how that's.

2397
02:40:39.76 --> 02:40:41.76
I don't know if you know this, but that's a thing.

2398
02:40:41.76 --> 02:40:47.76
People will watch other people on YouTube videos playing shooter games.

2399
02:40:47.76 --> 02:40:48.76
Okay.

2400
02:40:48.76 --> 02:40:52.76
Let's say I'm only into that.

2401
02:40:52.76 --> 02:40:54.76
I'm probably not going to subscribe.

2402
02:40:54.76 --> 02:40:56.76
Or actually this one's actually legitimate.

2403
02:40:56.76 --> 02:41:01.76
One that I can kind of dig and relate to is if my YouTube

2404
02:41:01.76 --> 02:41:05.76
Subscribing situation is only to kid stuff.

2405
02:41:05.76 --> 02:41:10.76
Only to kid stuff because everyone's in a while.

2406
02:41:10.76 --> 02:41:12.76
I give my phone to make it.

2407
02:41:12.76 --> 02:41:14.76
And they watch like, you know, they watch like,

2408
02:41:14.76 --> 02:41:17.76
Pippa pig or I don't know something.

2409
02:41:17.76 --> 02:41:19.76
Well, and then he'll make a comment.

2410
02:41:19.76 --> 02:41:20.76
I could make a comment.

2411
02:41:20.76 --> 02:41:25.76
I'll say this because a lot of times the podcast is just what the podcast is on YouTube.

2412
02:41:25.76 --> 02:41:28.76
But like the other day, you released a deleted scene.

2413
02:41:28.76 --> 02:41:29.76
It wasn't even deleted.

2414
02:41:29.76 --> 02:41:30.76
It was pre recording.

2415
02:41:30.76 --> 02:41:31.76
We were just talking.

2416
02:41:31.76 --> 02:41:32.76
Yeah, before.

2417
02:41:32.76 --> 02:41:33.76
And people seem to think it was pretty funny.

2418
02:41:33.76 --> 02:41:35.76
Yeah, even I thought it was quite funny.

2419
02:41:35.76 --> 02:41:36.76
I thought it was funny.

2420
02:41:36.76 --> 02:41:38.76
But when you detached it is really funny.

2421
02:41:38.76 --> 02:41:41.76
But the thing is if someone wasn't listening, if someone is not on

2422
02:41:41.76 --> 02:41:45.76
Subscribe to YouTube, they would never know that that existed.

2423
02:41:45.76 --> 02:41:47.76
And then you miss it.

2424
02:41:47.76 --> 02:41:48.76
And it's pretty funny.

2425
02:41:48.76 --> 02:41:50.76
Yeah, I thought it was funny too.

2426
02:41:50.76 --> 02:41:51.76
Yeah.

2427
02:41:51.76 --> 02:41:53.76
Even though it was kind of harsh.

2428
02:41:53.76 --> 02:41:55.76
You know, would you call me get away sticks?

2429
02:41:55.76 --> 02:41:56.76
Something like that.

2430
02:41:56.76 --> 02:42:00.76
You know, yeah, see, now you're, you just went into the

2431
02:42:00.76 --> 02:42:01.76
reasons to subscribe.

2432
02:42:01.76 --> 02:42:03.76
Oh, there's a whole really good because, you know,

2433
02:42:03.76 --> 02:42:06.76
the excerpts that we make,

2434
02:42:06.76 --> 02:42:08.76
put out, just cut,

2435
02:42:08.76 --> 02:42:11.76
tiny segments, three minutes, no, it is.

2436
02:42:11.76 --> 02:42:13.76
Even though the, even though the deleted scene was 16.

2437
02:42:13.76 --> 02:42:15.76
Yeah, you know, it's different, but.

2438
02:42:15.76 --> 02:42:16.76
No, it's pretty funny.

2439
02:42:16.76 --> 02:42:17.76
Yeah.

2440
02:42:17.76 --> 02:42:20.76
But the excerpts, you know, they're just like individual ideas that you

2441
02:42:20.76 --> 02:42:21.76
talk about, boom, shareable.

2442
02:42:21.76 --> 02:42:22.76
Oh, good.

2443
02:42:22.76 --> 02:42:24.76
That's a good reason to subscribe to YouTube.

2444
02:42:24.76 --> 02:42:25.76
One of the many, my opinion.

2445
02:42:25.76 --> 02:42:27.76
Also,

2446
02:42:27.76 --> 02:42:28.76
Chocolate is a store.

2447
02:42:28.76 --> 02:42:29.76
It's called,

2448
02:42:29.76 --> 02:42:30.76
ChocolateStore.

2449
02:42:30.76 --> 02:42:31.76
ChocolateStore.com.

2450
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:32.76
That's a URL.

2451
02:42:32.76 --> 02:42:34.76
On there, what do we have shirts?

2452
02:42:34.76 --> 02:42:36.76
Rashguards.

2453
02:42:36.76 --> 02:42:37.76
Rashguards.

2454
02:42:37.76 --> 02:42:39.76
We started for jujitsu,

2455
02:42:39.76 --> 02:42:40.76
but here's the thing.

2456
02:42:40.76 --> 02:42:43.76
Rashguards are for surfing and bodyboarding.

2457
02:42:43.76 --> 02:42:45.76
And Jacking Steel.

2458
02:42:45.76 --> 02:42:46.76
Jacking Steel.

2459
02:42:46.76 --> 02:42:47.76
Yes, cycling.

2460
02:42:47.76 --> 02:42:49.76
These are all, that's what really,

2461
02:42:49.76 --> 02:42:51.76
like a, it's a Spendex shirt.

2462
02:42:51.76 --> 02:42:53.76
There's little things.

2463
02:42:53.76 --> 02:42:55.76
Yeah, it's the term,

2464
02:42:55.76 --> 02:42:57.76
Rashguards only applies to surfing.

2465
02:42:57.76 --> 02:42:58.76
Because it does.

2466
02:42:58.76 --> 02:43:01.76
You, you're not worried about getting a rash when you're

2467
02:43:01.76 --> 02:43:02.76
lifting weights.

2468
02:43:02.76 --> 02:43:03.76
You're not worried about getting a rash.

2469
02:43:03.76 --> 02:43:04.76
I guess,

2470
02:43:04.76 --> 02:43:05.76
Yeah, I guess,

2471
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:06.76
and jujitsu.

2472
02:43:06.76 --> 02:43:07.76
Yeah, I guess so.

2473
02:43:07.76 --> 02:43:08.76
Yeah.

2474
02:43:08.76 --> 02:43:11.76
Guard you against rash or ringworm or whatever.

2475
02:43:11.76 --> 02:43:12.76
Yeah, it does.

2476
02:43:12.76 --> 02:43:13.76
Yeah, it does.

2477
02:43:13.76 --> 02:43:14.76
Yeah.

2478
02:43:14.76 --> 02:43:14.76
So,

2479
02:43:14.76 --> 02:43:16.76
Nonetheless, I mean, the point there is that it's for everything,

2480
02:43:16.76 --> 02:43:18.76
just because you hear chocolate talking about jujitsu.

2481
02:43:18.76 --> 02:43:19.76
Hold on, you know,

2482
02:43:19.76 --> 02:43:20.76
it's not for everything.

2483
02:43:20.76 --> 02:43:23.76
Because I don't want to see you at a club in a,

2484
02:43:23.76 --> 02:43:24.76
in a,

2485
02:43:24.76 --> 02:43:24.76
in a,

2486
02:43:24.76 --> 02:43:25.76
get after a rashguard.

2487
02:43:25.76 --> 02:43:26.76
Well,

2488
02:43:26.76 --> 02:43:26.76
that's,

2489
02:43:26.76 --> 02:43:28.76
you can speak for yourself.

2490
02:43:28.76 --> 02:43:31.76
Because if I saw someone at the club with a get after it,

2491
02:43:31.76 --> 02:43:33.76
I would,

2492
02:43:33.76 --> 02:43:35.76
I would say good evening to that person.

2493
02:43:35.76 --> 02:43:36.76
That's a good point.

2494
02:43:36.76 --> 02:43:37.76
And I guess I'm going to say that.

2495
02:43:37.76 --> 02:43:39.76
Can't be mad at it.

2496
02:43:39.76 --> 02:43:39.76
No,

2497
02:43:39.76 --> 02:43:40.76
I can't be.

2498
02:43:40.76 --> 02:43:41.76
No, no rash guards.

2499
02:43:41.76 --> 02:43:42.76
When you're out.

2500
02:43:42.76 --> 02:43:43.76
Not doing activities.

2501
02:43:43.76 --> 02:43:45.76
I'm not a supporter of that.

2502
02:43:45.76 --> 02:43:46.76
Yeah,

2503
02:43:46.76 --> 02:43:47.76
you know what,

2504
02:43:47.76 --> 02:43:47.76
to be,

2505
02:43:47.76 --> 02:43:48.76
to be completely honest.

2506
02:43:48.76 --> 02:43:49.76
I don't know that.

2507
02:43:49.76 --> 02:43:50.76
I would support it.

2508
02:43:50.76 --> 02:43:51.76
Just rolling.

2509
02:43:51.76 --> 02:43:52.76
I mean,

2510
02:43:52.76 --> 02:43:52.76
just like,

2511
02:43:52.76 --> 02:43:53.76
hey,

2512
02:43:53.76 --> 02:43:54.76
I'm going out.

2513
02:43:54.76 --> 02:43:55.76
I'm going to the supermarket.

2514
02:43:55.76 --> 02:43:56.76
Put on my get after a rash.

2515
02:43:56.76 --> 02:43:59.76
I guess if you do this like,

2516
02:43:59.76 --> 02:44:00.76
you never know what's going to happen.

2517
02:44:00.76 --> 02:44:01.76
Yeah.

2518
02:44:01.76 --> 02:44:02.76
You might want to be ready.

2519
02:44:02.76 --> 02:44:03.76
Right.

2520
02:44:03.76 --> 02:44:04.76
It's true.

2521
02:44:04.76 --> 02:44:06.76
I know you get some good workouts in the grocery store yourself.

2522
02:44:06.76 --> 02:44:07.76
You know,

2523
02:44:07.76 --> 02:44:08.76
I can't even train the six back.

2524
02:44:08.76 --> 02:44:09.76
I know.

2525
02:44:09.76 --> 02:44:09.76
For,

2526
02:44:09.76 --> 02:44:10.76
you know,

2527
02:44:10.76 --> 02:44:11.76
long line.

2528
02:44:11.76 --> 02:44:12.76
Yeah.

2529
02:44:12.76 --> 02:44:12.76
You're in the rash guard.

2530
02:44:12.76 --> 02:44:13.76
You're compression.

2531
02:44:13.76 --> 02:44:14.76
You're ready.

2532
02:44:14.76 --> 02:44:15.76
It's absolutely true.

2533
02:44:15.76 --> 02:44:15.76
And,

2534
02:44:15.76 --> 02:44:16.76
you know,

2535
02:44:16.76 --> 02:44:17.76
you want to look into that.

2536
02:44:17.76 --> 02:44:18.76
Go to jockelstore.com.

2537
02:44:18.76 --> 02:44:19.76
So,

2538
02:44:19.76 --> 02:44:21.76
the shirts on there.

2539
02:44:21.76 --> 02:44:21.76
I can,

2540
02:44:21.76 --> 02:44:23.76
I try to add like a new one.

2541
02:44:23.76 --> 02:44:24.76
Every,

2542
02:44:24.76 --> 02:44:24.76
what,

2543
02:44:24.76 --> 02:44:25.76
like month.

2544
02:44:25.76 --> 02:44:27.76
I don't know what your goal is.

2545
02:44:27.76 --> 02:44:28.76
Yeah.

2546
02:44:28.76 --> 02:44:29.76
I don't know.

2547
02:44:29.76 --> 02:44:31.76
I've been wearing bronze in children.

2548
02:44:31.76 --> 02:44:32.76
T-shirt.

2549
02:44:32.76 --> 02:44:33.76
Me too.

2550
02:44:33.76 --> 02:44:33.76
Yeah.

2551
02:44:33.76 --> 02:44:34.76
That's the one.

2552
02:44:34.76 --> 02:44:35.76
Because that's,

2553
02:44:35.76 --> 02:44:36.76
Yeah.

2554
02:44:36.76 --> 02:44:37.76
They'll,

2555
02:44:37.76 --> 02:44:37.76
Yeah.

2556
02:44:37.76 --> 02:44:38.76
That's the shirt that you made.

2557
02:44:38.76 --> 02:44:39.76
It's a knurder.

2558
02:44:39.76 --> 02:44:40.76
That's it.

2559
02:44:40.76 --> 02:44:43.76
The one that you made with my face on it,

2560
02:44:43.76 --> 02:44:44.76
whatever thing.

2561
02:44:44.76 --> 02:44:45.76
So,

2562
02:44:45.76 --> 02:44:47.76
I'd always get caught up on the front.

2563
02:44:47.76 --> 02:44:47.76
Like,

2564
02:44:47.76 --> 02:44:48.76
How high that's funny,

2565
02:44:48.76 --> 02:44:50.76
the front and all the layers on the front.

2566
02:44:50.76 --> 02:44:51.76
But on the back,

2567
02:44:51.76 --> 02:44:52.76
it says,

2568
02:44:52.76 --> 02:44:53.76
Good evening.

2569
02:44:53.76 --> 02:44:53.76
So,

2570
02:44:53.76 --> 02:44:54.76
when you wear that one,

2571
02:44:54.76 --> 02:44:56.76
that's when people are going to talk to you the most.

2572
02:44:56.76 --> 02:44:57.76
You know,

2573
02:44:57.76 --> 02:44:58.76
you're not like,

2574
02:44:58.76 --> 02:45:00.76
you don't worry the one with your face on it,

2575
02:45:00.76 --> 02:45:01.76
every day.

2576
02:45:01.76 --> 02:45:01.76
No.

2577
02:45:01.76 --> 02:45:02.76
There's no reason for you to.

2578
02:45:02.76 --> 02:45:02.76
No,

2579
02:45:02.76 --> 02:45:03.76
Okay.

2580
02:45:03.76 --> 02:45:03.76
Yeah.

2581
02:45:03.76 --> 02:45:04.76
It would be weird.

2582
02:45:04.76 --> 02:45:05.76
I'd have my face.

2583
02:45:05.76 --> 02:45:06.76
Yeah.

2584
02:45:06.76 --> 02:45:07.76
You need to.

2585
02:45:07.76 --> 02:45:08.76
You wearing my face right now.

2586
02:45:08.76 --> 02:45:09.76
Yeah.

2587
02:45:09.76 --> 02:45:10.76
Exactly.

2588
02:45:10.76 --> 02:45:10.76
You know,

2589
02:45:10.76 --> 02:45:11.76
look at that.

2590
02:45:11.76 --> 02:45:12.76
Um,

2591
02:45:12.76 --> 02:45:14.76
but if you wear that one,

2592
02:45:14.76 --> 02:45:14.76
it says,

2593
02:45:14.76 --> 02:45:15.76
Good evening on the back.

2594
02:45:15.76 --> 02:45:16.76
So,

2595
02:45:16.76 --> 02:45:17.76
I never really thought of this.

2596
02:45:17.76 --> 02:45:18.76
I haven't worn it.

2597
02:45:18.76 --> 02:45:19.76
I don't even have one.

2598
02:45:19.76 --> 02:45:21.76
But that's the,

2599
02:45:21.76 --> 02:45:22.76
when I'd wear this one,

2600
02:45:22.76 --> 02:45:23.76
one,

2601
02:45:23.76 --> 02:45:24.76
good.

2602
02:45:24.76 --> 02:45:25.76
People will say something.

2603
02:45:25.76 --> 02:45:26.76
It would be like,

2604
02:45:26.76 --> 02:45:27.76
you're good.

2605
02:45:27.76 --> 02:45:28.76
It's back.

2606
02:45:28.76 --> 02:45:28.76
Richard,

2607
02:45:28.76 --> 02:45:29.76
You're sure it's backwards.

2608
02:45:29.76 --> 02:45:30.76
I don't know.

2609
02:45:30.76 --> 02:45:31.76
Who's that guy in your shirt?

2610
02:45:31.76 --> 02:45:31.76
Whatever.

2611
02:45:31.76 --> 02:45:32.76
People will say something to you.

2612
02:45:32.76 --> 02:45:33.76
The good evening one.

2613
02:45:33.76 --> 02:45:34.76
They'll talk to you even more.

2614
02:45:34.76 --> 02:45:35.76
But they'll do it from behind.

2615
02:45:35.76 --> 02:45:36.76
They'll tell you good evening.

2616
02:45:36.76 --> 02:45:37.76
Every single time.

2617
02:45:37.76 --> 02:45:38.76
Interesting.

2618
02:45:38.76 --> 02:45:39.76
You haven't worn it.

2619
02:45:39.76 --> 02:45:39.76
Yeah.

2620
02:45:39.76 --> 02:45:40.76
How do you know this?

2621
02:45:40.76 --> 02:45:40.76
No.

2622
02:45:40.76 --> 02:45:41.76
Because I know.

2623
02:45:41.76 --> 02:45:42.76
I know the compulsion,

2624
02:45:42.76 --> 02:45:43.76
like I know the feeling.

2625
02:45:43.76 --> 02:45:44.76
That's my hypothesis.

2626
02:45:44.76 --> 02:45:45.76
Anyway.

2627
02:45:45.76 --> 02:45:46.76
And from what I hear from the field.

2628
02:45:46.76 --> 02:45:47.76
Anyway.

2629
02:45:47.76 --> 02:45:48.76
Go on.

2630
02:45:48.76 --> 02:45:49.76
There.

2631
02:45:49.76 --> 02:45:50.76
If you like something,

2632
02:45:50.76 --> 02:45:52.76
get something that's a good way to support.

2633
02:45:52.76 --> 02:45:54.76
There's some hats.

2634
02:45:54.76 --> 02:45:55.76
Oh,

2635
02:45:55.76 --> 02:45:56.76
really.

2636
02:45:56.76 --> 02:45:57.76
Release coming out.

2637
02:45:57.76 --> 02:45:58.76
So.

2638
02:45:58.76 --> 02:46:00.76
Within one week.

2639
02:46:00.76 --> 02:46:01.76
How about that?

2640
02:46:01.76 --> 02:46:02.76
Cool.

2641
02:46:02.76 --> 02:46:03.76
Okay.

2642
02:46:03.76 --> 02:46:03.76
All right.

2643
02:46:03.76 --> 02:46:04.76
There it is.

2644
02:46:04.76 --> 02:46:06.76
I better have like nine of them lined up at my doorstep.

2645
02:46:06.76 --> 02:46:07.76
I could.

2646
02:46:07.76 --> 02:46:08.76
Because I need some of them hats.

2647
02:46:08.76 --> 02:46:09.76
You got it, Brian.

2648
02:46:09.76 --> 02:46:10.76
Promise.

2649
02:46:10.76 --> 02:46:11.76
So yeah.

2650
02:46:11.76 --> 02:46:12.76
Some patches on there as well.

2651
02:46:12.76 --> 02:46:13.76
Anyway.

2652
02:46:13.76 --> 02:46:13.76
Check it out.

2653
02:46:13.76 --> 02:46:14.76
If you like something, get something.

2654
02:46:14.76 --> 02:46:15.76
Also.

2655
02:46:15.76 --> 02:46:16.76
Psychological warfare.

2656
02:46:16.76 --> 02:46:17.76
If you don't know what that is.

2657
02:46:17.76 --> 02:46:20.76
It's an album with tracks.

2658
02:46:20.76 --> 02:46:21.76
Jocco tracks.

2659
02:46:21.76 --> 02:46:23.76
This is Jocco talking.

2660
02:46:23.76 --> 02:46:27.76
I think you through various points of weakness in your.

2661
02:46:27.76 --> 02:46:32.76
I've been really trying to think of a word to say other than journey.

2662
02:46:32.76 --> 02:46:33.76
I haven't yet.

2663
02:46:33.76 --> 02:46:34.76
So we're in stick with journey.

2664
02:46:34.76 --> 02:46:35.76
So when you're on your journey.

2665
02:46:35.76 --> 02:46:36.76
You're trying to wake up.

2666
02:46:36.76 --> 02:46:38.76
You're trying to wake up early.

2667
02:46:38.76 --> 02:46:40.76
Maybe I will do it.

2668
02:46:40.76 --> 02:46:41.76
You're trying to work out.

2669
02:46:41.76 --> 02:46:42.76
You're trying to work out.

2670
02:46:42.76 --> 02:46:43.76
Every day.

2671
02:46:43.76 --> 02:46:44.76
Every day.

2672
02:46:44.76 --> 02:46:44.76
No.

2673
02:46:44.76 --> 02:46:45.76
Even on rest days.

2674
02:46:45.76 --> 02:46:46.76
You're doing a mobility.

2675
02:46:46.76 --> 02:46:47.76
What for sure.

2676
02:46:47.76 --> 02:46:47.76
Like this.

2677
02:46:47.76 --> 02:46:48.76
Yeah.

2678
02:46:48.76 --> 02:46:49.76
Man.

2679
02:46:49.76 --> 02:46:50.76
Something like that.

2680
02:46:50.76 --> 02:46:53.76
You want to turn those.

2681
02:46:53.76 --> 02:46:54.76
Those work out days in.

2682
02:46:54.76 --> 02:46:56.76
So don't do that.

2683
02:46:56.76 --> 02:46:58.76
And if you need a little spot with that.

2684
02:46:58.76 --> 02:46:59.76
You listen to psychological warfare.

2685
02:46:59.76 --> 02:47:00.76
There's a track for that.

2686
02:47:00.76 --> 02:47:02.76
For any point of weakness.

2687
02:47:02.76 --> 02:47:03.76
Like I said.

2688
02:47:03.76 --> 02:47:05.76
Get after it.

2689
02:47:05.76 --> 02:47:06.76
Psychological warfare.

2690
02:47:06.76 --> 02:47:08.76
Amazon music.

2691
02:47:08.76 --> 02:47:09.76
iTunes.

2692
02:47:09.76 --> 02:47:11.76
Various other MP3 outlets.

2693
02:47:11.76 --> 02:47:12.76
Jocco willing.

2694
02:47:12.76 --> 02:47:14.76
Now.

2695
02:47:14.76 --> 02:47:15.76
First.

2696
02:47:15.76 --> 02:47:17.76
If you haven't heard yet.

2697
02:47:17.76 --> 02:47:20.76
We are now in league.

2698
02:47:20.76 --> 02:47:23.76
With origin USA.

2699
02:47:23.76 --> 02:47:25.76
Little company.

2700
02:47:25.76 --> 02:47:27.76
We are now a part of.

2701
02:47:27.76 --> 02:47:29.76
It's been months in the making.

2702
02:47:29.76 --> 02:47:35.76
We've been going back and forth with my boy Pete Roberts.

2703
02:47:35.76 --> 02:47:37.76
And who actually this is.

2704
02:47:37.76 --> 02:47:38.76
You went up a layer.

2705
02:47:38.76 --> 02:47:43.76
The reason that we are linked up in the beginning was because of Sarah Armstrong.

2706
02:47:43.76 --> 02:47:44.76
Sure.

2707
02:47:44.76 --> 02:47:46.76
Who's going to be a part of the world.

2708
02:47:46.76 --> 02:47:47.76
Sure.

2709
02:47:47.76 --> 02:47:51.76
Who heard me talking about how cool origin was.

2710
02:47:51.76 --> 02:47:52.76
Yeah.

2711
02:47:52.76 --> 02:47:53.76
That they make everything into America.

2712
02:47:53.76 --> 02:47:57.76
She sent Pete and email and said, hey, I know you run this company in this guy.

2713
02:47:57.76 --> 02:47:58.76
What's talking about you?

2714
02:47:58.76 --> 02:47:59.76
You guys should talk to each other.

2715
02:47:59.76 --> 02:48:00.76
Guess what?

2716
02:48:00.76 --> 02:48:01.76
We talked.

2717
02:48:01.76 --> 02:48:03.76
And now we're getting after it.

2718
02:48:03.76 --> 02:48:04.76
And we joined forces.

2719
02:48:04.76 --> 02:48:08.76
So we're planning all kinds of things.

2720
02:48:08.76 --> 02:48:10.76
And gear.

2721
02:48:10.76 --> 02:48:11.76
Geese.

2722
02:48:11.76 --> 02:48:12.76
Rash guards.

2723
02:48:12.76 --> 02:48:14.76
Planning some supplements.

2724
02:48:14.76 --> 02:48:15.76
Believe it or not.

2725
02:48:15.76 --> 02:48:17.76
Is the rash guard back in stock?

2726
02:48:17.76 --> 02:48:18.76
Not yet.

2727
02:48:18.76 --> 02:48:19.76
We're doing a little.

2728
02:48:19.76 --> 02:48:22.76
We're doing a lot of building right now.

2729
02:48:22.76 --> 02:48:23.76
Yeah.

2730
02:48:23.76 --> 02:48:25.76
But we got all kinds of things coming.

2731
02:48:25.76 --> 02:48:30.76
Basically, you know, basically I want to make everything that I used to get after it.

2732
02:48:30.76 --> 02:48:31.76
Yeah.

2733
02:48:31.76 --> 02:48:32.76
I want to make.

2734
02:48:32.76 --> 02:48:34.76
So everything.

2735
02:48:34.76 --> 02:48:36.76
And when I say everything is not a long list.

2736
02:48:36.76 --> 02:48:38.76
I don't use that much stuff to get after it.

2737
02:48:38.76 --> 02:48:39.76
Yeah.

2738
02:48:39.76 --> 02:48:40.76
I use it pretty small list.

2739
02:48:40.76 --> 02:48:41.76
Yeah.

2740
02:48:41.76 --> 02:48:43.76
But I want to make it.

2741
02:48:43.76 --> 02:48:44.76
And I want to make it.

2742
02:48:44.76 --> 02:48:45.76
And America.

2743
02:48:45.76 --> 02:48:50.76
So if you want to check it out check out originmain.com because it's a new England.

2744
02:48:50.76 --> 02:48:51.76
Which we're on from.

2745
02:48:51.76 --> 02:48:52.76
There.

2746
02:48:52.76 --> 02:48:54.76
No big dealers.

2747
02:48:54.76 --> 02:48:55.76
Layers indeed.

2748
02:48:55.76 --> 02:49:01.76
And also if you want to get into it, like now, you want to find out really what's going on.

2749
02:49:01.76 --> 02:49:04.76
There's an origin immersion to get to camp in Maine.

2750
02:49:04.76 --> 02:49:07.76
I didn't realize I hadn't even explain what this is.

2751
02:49:07.76 --> 02:49:08.76
You've received.

2752
02:49:08.76 --> 02:49:09.76
See, I'm from New England.

2753
02:49:09.76 --> 02:49:10.76
So I know what this is.

2754
02:49:10.76 --> 02:49:11.76
I know what a camp is.

2755
02:49:11.76 --> 02:49:13.76
You may or may not know.

2756
02:49:13.76 --> 02:49:16.76
People in other parts of the country, many or many, I know.

2757
02:49:16.76 --> 02:49:19.76
A camp in this form is in this situation.

2758
02:49:19.76 --> 02:49:20.76
It's big lake.

2759
02:49:20.76 --> 02:49:22.76
And on the lake, there's a property.

2760
02:49:22.76 --> 02:49:25.76
And on the property, they have a bunch of little cabins.

2761
02:49:25.76 --> 02:49:26.76
A bunch of them.

2762
02:49:26.76 --> 02:49:28.76
Like multiple cabins.

2763
02:49:28.76 --> 02:49:31.76
And when you go to a camp, you stay in the cabins.

2764
02:49:31.76 --> 02:49:34.76
And then they have a kind of a central area.

2765
02:49:34.76 --> 02:49:37.76
Well, we are renting out the entire camp.

2766
02:49:37.76 --> 02:49:38.76
I don't know how many cabins.

2767
02:49:38.76 --> 02:49:41.76
It's like dozens and dozens of cabins.

2768
02:49:41.76 --> 02:49:42.76
Right?

2769
02:49:42.76 --> 02:49:45.76
All these things on the lake.

2770
02:49:45.76 --> 02:49:47.76
And then there's a main kind of gathering area.

2771
02:49:47.76 --> 02:49:50.76
Well, guess what we're putting in the main gathering area.

2772
02:49:50.76 --> 02:49:51.76
Let us.

2773
02:49:51.76 --> 02:49:52.76
Matt.

2774
02:49:52.76 --> 02:49:55.76
So we're going to go.

2775
02:49:55.76 --> 02:49:57.76
You know, if you want to come, you come up.

2776
02:49:57.76 --> 02:49:58.76
You come to Maine.

2777
02:49:58.76 --> 02:49:59.76
It's three hours from Boston.

2778
02:49:59.76 --> 02:50:02.76
It's an half an hour from a gust of Maine.

2779
02:50:02.76 --> 02:50:03.76
We're going to be there.

2780
02:50:03.76 --> 02:50:05.76
Echoing are going to be there.

2781
02:50:05.76 --> 02:50:07.76
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

2782
02:50:07.76 --> 02:50:09.76
There's two sessions that are going on.

2783
02:50:09.76 --> 02:50:11.76
The first one's the 20.

2784
02:50:11.76 --> 02:50:14.76
The 20th through the 23rd, I think.

2785
02:50:14.76 --> 02:50:16.76
Yeah, the 20th through the 23rd.

2786
02:50:16.76 --> 02:50:17.76
So Echoing are going to be there.

2787
02:50:17.76 --> 02:50:18.76
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

2788
02:50:18.76 --> 02:50:22.76
So we're going to be the part of both sessions.

2789
02:50:22.76 --> 02:50:24.76
And so come to that.

2790
02:50:24.76 --> 02:50:26.76
And what we're going to do is we're going to train two jets.

2791
02:50:26.76 --> 02:50:29.76
But you're going to train two jets to so many hours a day.

2792
02:50:29.76 --> 02:50:30.76
So what else are we going to do?

2793
02:50:30.76 --> 02:50:32.76
We're going to hang out with a cruise.

2794
02:50:32.76 --> 02:50:33.76
We're going to do some kind of.

2795
02:50:33.76 --> 02:50:35.76
There's a big lake there.

2796
02:50:35.76 --> 02:50:37.76
So you can't surf from the lake.

2797
02:50:37.76 --> 02:50:39.76
But we'll figure something water activity out.

2798
02:50:39.76 --> 02:50:40.76
Right?

2799
02:50:40.76 --> 02:50:44.76
And we're going to make a lobster and I don't like lobster, but I'm going to have steak.

2800
02:50:44.76 --> 02:50:45.76
And you can have lobster.

2801
02:50:45.76 --> 02:50:48.76
And yeah, so we're going to be hanging out.

2802
02:50:48.76 --> 02:50:49.76
Wait, this is the lake.

2803
02:50:49.76 --> 02:50:51.76
Is the lake cold?

2804
02:50:51.76 --> 02:50:52.76
Can we swim in the lake?

2805
02:50:52.76 --> 02:50:53.76
You can swim in the lake.

2806
02:50:53.76 --> 02:50:54.76
Really cold.

2807
02:50:54.76 --> 02:50:55.76
I don't know about.

2808
02:50:55.76 --> 02:50:56.76
I don't know the temperature of lake.

2809
02:50:56.76 --> 02:50:58.76
But main summertime.

2810
02:50:58.76 --> 02:51:00.76
It'll be, it's not going to be freezing.

2811
02:51:00.76 --> 02:51:01.76
Okay.

2812
02:51:01.76 --> 02:51:01.76
I don't think.

2813
02:51:01.76 --> 02:51:03.76
And if it is good to get rid of musculos.

2814
02:51:03.76 --> 02:51:05.76
Right, right, recovery.

2815
02:51:05.76 --> 02:51:06.76
And also during this.

2816
02:51:06.76 --> 02:51:07.76
So during this thing, too.

2817
02:51:07.76 --> 02:51:09.76
If you come up or if you can't make that,

2818
02:51:09.76 --> 02:51:10.76
and you want to come up for this anyways,

2819
02:51:10.76 --> 02:51:15.76
we're having the grand opening of our new origin factory in farming can main.

2820
02:51:15.76 --> 02:51:18.76
So big factory.

2821
02:51:18.76 --> 02:51:19.76
20,000 square feet.

2822
02:51:19.76 --> 02:51:22.76
I think it's bigger than 20,000 square feet.

2823
02:51:22.76 --> 02:51:24.76
Everyone's invited to that.

2824
02:51:24.76 --> 02:51:25.76
Come hang out.

2825
02:51:25.76 --> 02:51:26.76
You know what I'm thinking?

2826
02:51:26.76 --> 02:51:27.76
We do like a Q&A or something.

2827
02:51:27.76 --> 02:51:28.76
Well, hang out.

2828
02:51:28.76 --> 02:51:30.76
Well, I'm going to bring books.

2829
02:51:30.76 --> 02:51:32.76
We'll just kick it.

2830
02:51:32.76 --> 02:51:34.76
So come up to that.

2831
02:51:34.76 --> 02:51:37.76
That is the 23rd of August in main coming hang out.

2832
02:51:37.76 --> 02:51:38.76
Like I said.

2833
02:51:38.76 --> 02:51:40.76
What is the jiu-jitsu part of it?

2834
02:51:40.76 --> 02:51:42.76
What, how does that work?

2835
02:51:42.76 --> 02:51:44.76
Like, you know, there's two weeks.

2836
02:51:44.76 --> 02:51:45.76
You can go for the whole thing.

2837
02:51:45.76 --> 02:51:46.76
But no, it's not two weeks.

2838
02:51:46.76 --> 02:51:47.76
It's one week long.

2839
02:51:47.76 --> 02:51:48.76
It's from the 20th to 20th.

2840
02:51:48.76 --> 02:51:48.76
Okay.

2841
02:51:48.76 --> 02:51:50.76
What is bringing in two sessions.

2842
02:51:50.76 --> 02:51:52.76
So when you mean sessions, like what?

2843
02:51:52.76 --> 02:51:53.76
We all just roll.

2844
02:51:53.76 --> 02:51:54.76
You have different teachers.

2845
02:51:54.76 --> 02:51:55.76
Yeah, there's different teachers.

2846
02:51:55.76 --> 02:51:56.76
Yeah, there's different teachers.

2847
02:51:56.76 --> 02:51:57.76
All right, so I'm going to.

2848
02:51:57.76 --> 02:51:58.76
Yeah, but you know, I think we're doing,

2849
02:51:58.76 --> 02:52:01.76
I think it's three sessions a day of jiu-jitsu.

2850
02:52:01.76 --> 02:52:01.76
Yeah.

2851
02:52:01.76 --> 02:52:03.76
I mean, how many sessions can you roll hard at?

2852
02:52:03.76 --> 02:52:04.76
So some of them, okay.

2853
02:52:04.76 --> 02:52:06.76
You know, I'll drill some technique with you.

2854
02:52:06.76 --> 02:52:08.76
Maybe you could go over some front lock stuff with me.

2855
02:52:08.76 --> 02:52:09.76
Or what, you know what I mean?

2856
02:52:09.76 --> 02:52:10.76
Yeah.

2857
02:52:10.76 --> 02:52:11.76
I think there's going to be some of that.

2858
02:52:11.76 --> 02:52:13.76
And but then there's also a bunch of different black belts going to be there.

2859
02:52:13.76 --> 02:52:14.76
Yeah.

2860
02:52:14.76 --> 02:52:15.76
To hang out like show moves.

2861
02:52:15.76 --> 02:52:16.76
Yeah.

2862
02:52:16.76 --> 02:52:17.76
So we're in immersion.

2863
02:52:17.76 --> 02:52:18.76
Yeah.

2864
02:52:18.76 --> 02:52:19.76
That's how you learn.

2865
02:52:19.76 --> 02:52:20.76
Gotcha.

2866
02:52:20.76 --> 02:52:23.76
So I know not go Nolan's coming to that from the west coast.

2867
02:52:23.76 --> 02:52:24.76
Yeah.

2868
02:52:24.76 --> 02:52:26.76
He's coming out and he just hit me up.

2869
02:52:26.76 --> 02:52:28.76
So yeah, come on up to that.

2870
02:52:28.76 --> 02:52:29.76
We have a good time.

2871
02:52:29.76 --> 02:52:32.76
Also when we're there, we're going to have some chocolate.

2872
02:52:32.76 --> 02:52:38.76
So if there's anyone that wants to instantly deadlift 8,000 pounds,

2873
02:52:38.76 --> 02:52:40.76
you can get the juggle.

2874
02:52:40.76 --> 02:52:41.76
White tea.

2875
02:52:41.76 --> 02:52:44.76
If you need to crush an academic test.

2876
02:52:44.76 --> 02:52:45.76
Get juggle away.

2877
02:52:45.76 --> 02:52:47.76
Hey, if you need some right now, you can get some on Amazon.

2878
02:52:47.76 --> 02:52:48.76
Books.

2879
02:52:48.76 --> 02:52:50.76
We got some books.

2880
02:52:50.76 --> 02:52:56.76
For your kid or whatever kids you know, we got the way of the warrior kid.

2881
02:52:56.76 --> 02:52:58.76
There's lessons in there for everybody.

2882
02:52:58.76 --> 02:52:59.76
Check it out.

2883
02:52:59.76 --> 02:53:03.76
If you want the first edition of discipline equals freedom, field manual,

2884
02:53:03.76 --> 02:53:08.76
order it soon or go to your bookstore and tell them you want to get it.

2885
02:53:08.76 --> 02:53:13.76
Preorder it whenever you got to do Amazon Barnes and Noble's your local bookstore.

2886
02:53:13.76 --> 02:53:14.76
Get it.

2887
02:53:14.76 --> 02:53:20.76
Now I'm going to tell you don't get this book for your wine-sipping book club.

2888
02:53:20.76 --> 02:53:22.76
Not a book for them.

2889
02:53:22.76 --> 02:53:23.76
They won't like it.

2890
02:53:23.76 --> 02:53:25.76
You're part of that club.

2891
02:53:25.76 --> 02:53:26.76
Don't get it for them.

2892
02:53:26.76 --> 02:53:28.76
You can still get it, but don't bring it to the book club.

2893
02:53:28.76 --> 02:53:32.76
They're they're they're sipping wine. They're not in a game.

2894
02:53:32.76 --> 02:53:40.76
But if you want to get stronger, tougher, smarter, healthier, and more prepared all around better person.

2895
02:53:40.76 --> 02:53:42.76
Get the book.

2896
02:53:42.76 --> 02:53:44.76
Discipline equals freedom, field manual.

2897
02:53:44.76 --> 02:53:50.76
Comes out October 17th, which means they're printing it almost now.

2898
02:53:50.76 --> 02:53:54.76
So that means if you don't order it, isn't there going to be backed up?

2899
02:53:54.76 --> 02:53:55.76
You're not going to have it.

2900
02:53:55.76 --> 02:53:58.76
If it's going to have it, you're going to have an edge on you.

2901
02:53:58.76 --> 02:54:00.76
Maybe you never recover.

2902
02:54:00.76 --> 02:54:02.76
Like that battle I was talking about earlier.

2903
02:54:02.76 --> 02:54:04.76
Someone else gets the edge on you.

2904
02:54:04.76 --> 02:54:05.76
You just get a mega.

2905
02:54:05.76 --> 02:54:08.76
Also extreme ownership on it, refer to it.

2906
02:54:08.76 --> 02:54:13.76
Highlight it, implement it, spread the word, get it for your team, your company, your organization.

2907
02:54:13.76 --> 02:54:16.76
Relate that with my brother, Lave Babin.

2908
02:54:16.76 --> 02:54:20.76
So if you don't have that, then you have copies for every single person that you ever known.

2909
02:54:20.76 --> 02:54:22.76
Get it for him.

2910
02:54:22.76 --> 02:54:28.76
Also, actually, on front leadership consulting assessments, instruction me,

2911
02:54:28.76 --> 02:54:37.76
Wave Babin, J.P. to know Dave Burke, get the team organized and coordinated for action and for victory.

2912
02:54:37.76 --> 02:54:38.76
That's my recommendation.

2913
02:54:38.76 --> 02:54:46.76
If you want to get that process going, email info at echelonfront.com.

2914
02:54:46.76 --> 02:54:51.76
Finally, the master is September 14th and 15th in San Diego.

2915
02:54:51.76 --> 02:54:54.76
All the other masters have sold out.

2916
02:54:54.76 --> 02:54:58.76
More than half the tickets for San Diego have already sold out.

2917
02:54:58.76 --> 02:55:01.76
So this is going to sell out.

2918
02:55:01.76 --> 02:55:02.76
Don't get left out in the cold.

2919
02:55:02.76 --> 02:55:06.76
You can register it extreme ownership.com.

2920
02:55:06.76 --> 02:55:12.76
And if you need to talk to us before you see us at the immersion camp in Maine.

2921
02:55:12.76 --> 02:55:18.76
And before you go to the master in San Diego, you can find us on the inner webs.

2922
02:55:18.76 --> 02:55:30.76
The Twitter, the Instagram, that Facebookie Boat, and also, the Snapchat.

2923
02:55:30.76 --> 02:55:31.76
You're on Snapchat?

2924
02:55:31.76 --> 02:55:32.76
I'm on it.

2925
02:55:32.76 --> 02:55:35.76
I'm learning from my children.

2926
02:55:35.76 --> 02:55:36.76
Okay.

2927
02:55:36.76 --> 02:55:37.76
Good.

2928
02:55:37.76 --> 02:55:38.76
That's the way people communicate now.

2929
02:55:38.76 --> 02:55:39.76
The Snapchat.

2930
02:55:39.76 --> 02:55:41.76
And I look on the pages.

2931
02:55:41.76 --> 02:55:42.76
Guess what?

2932
02:55:42.76 --> 02:55:44.76
Wall Street journals on there.

2933
02:55:44.76 --> 02:55:45.76
The economist is on there.

2934
02:55:45.76 --> 02:55:49.76
It's not this thing for your teenage 14 year old kid anymore.

2935
02:55:49.76 --> 02:55:53.76
Well, it is, but yeah, it may kind of got out of the basement.

2936
02:55:53.76 --> 02:55:54.76
It's also made of glue.

2937
02:55:54.76 --> 02:55:55.76
I don't know.

2938
02:55:55.76 --> 02:55:56.76
That's something to it.

2939
02:55:56.76 --> 02:55:57.76
I don't know.

2940
02:55:57.76 --> 02:55:59.76
I'm talking rubbish, but I have a Snapchat.

2941
02:55:59.76 --> 02:56:00.76
I don't use it.

2942
02:56:00.76 --> 02:56:03.76
And I think you got to confirm your account.

2943
02:56:03.76 --> 02:56:06.76
I was doing it because my daughter likes to make the faces.

2944
02:56:06.76 --> 02:56:07.76
Yeah, crazy faces.

2945
02:56:07.76 --> 02:56:09.76
My younger star likes to do that too.

2946
02:56:09.76 --> 02:56:12.76
Yeah, so she did it on my wife's phone all the time and then she hit me up for it.

2947
02:56:12.76 --> 02:56:15.76
Like, hey, let me do she call it Snapchat.

2948
02:56:15.76 --> 02:56:16.76
So she's like, let me Snapchat.

2949
02:56:16.76 --> 02:56:17.76
She doesn't know what it is.

2950
02:56:17.76 --> 02:56:18.76
She thinks it's just a face thing.

2951
02:56:18.76 --> 02:56:19.76
So I'm like, all right.

2952
02:56:19.76 --> 02:56:20.76
So I tried to do it.

2953
02:56:20.76 --> 02:56:23.76
And sometimes I got to confirm I was like, nah, so I didn't.

2954
02:56:23.76 --> 02:56:27.76
But I'm, yeah, I guess I'm like one foot in one foot out kind of thing.

2955
02:56:27.76 --> 02:56:30.76
Well, I'm not, I haven't posted anything yet.

2956
02:56:30.76 --> 02:56:31.76
Yeah.

2957
02:56:31.76 --> 02:56:32.76
But I'm going to go.

2958
02:56:32.76 --> 02:56:33.76
I almost did.

2959
02:56:33.76 --> 02:56:34.76
I was like trying to figure it out.

2960
02:56:34.76 --> 02:56:35.76
Yeah, yeah.

2961
02:56:35.76 --> 02:56:36.76
Dang.

2962
02:56:36.76 --> 02:56:36.76
That's good.

2963
02:56:36.76 --> 02:56:39.76
But Jade told me, well, this is what Jade told me, which was smart.

2964
02:56:39.76 --> 02:56:40.76
Yeah.

2965
02:56:40.76 --> 02:56:41.76
This is what Jade told me.

2966
02:56:41.76 --> 02:56:42.76
Brother Jade.

2967
02:56:42.76 --> 02:56:45.76
I said, you know what's just, I don't really understand it.

2968
02:56:45.76 --> 02:56:47.76
And he goes, that's why you need to do it.

2969
02:56:47.76 --> 02:56:48.76
I know.

2970
02:56:48.76 --> 02:56:49.76
Oh, he's like, wow.

2971
02:56:49.76 --> 02:56:50.76
Wow.

2972
02:56:50.76 --> 02:56:51.76
I said to myself, okay, you're right.

2973
02:56:51.76 --> 02:56:53.76
Don't, like, oh, I'm afraid of something.

2974
02:56:53.76 --> 02:56:54.76
Why am I afraid of it?

2975
02:56:54.76 --> 02:56:55.76
Don't understand it.

2976
02:56:55.76 --> 02:56:56.76
How do you overcome that?

2977
02:56:56.76 --> 02:56:57.76
Yeah.

2978
02:56:57.76 --> 02:57:00.76
Because apparently it's a good method of communication.

2979
02:57:00.76 --> 02:57:01.76
Yeah.

2980
02:57:01.76 --> 02:57:03.76
And men, and not to say Jade said so.

2981
02:57:03.76 --> 02:57:04.76
So it's right.

2982
02:57:04.76 --> 02:57:05.76
I'm not saying that.

2983
02:57:05.76 --> 02:57:06.76
But he's real smart with that kind of stuff.

2984
02:57:06.76 --> 02:57:08.76
Like he knows he knows the trends.

2985
02:57:08.76 --> 02:57:11.76
So he can like predict shit.

2986
02:57:11.76 --> 02:57:14.76
You know, like how it'll work and who's going to, he is.

2987
02:57:14.76 --> 02:57:19.76
In fact, what he does now is AI artificial intelligence with applications and stuff like that.

2988
02:57:19.76 --> 02:57:21.76
So he knows that stuff.

2989
02:57:21.76 --> 02:57:24.76
So it's like, when he kind of says he can't help but be like, ah, you're right.

2990
02:57:24.76 --> 02:57:28.76
You know, even if you don't know, you're like, well, consider the source kind of thing.

2991
02:57:28.76 --> 02:57:32.76
In fact, he got me into cryptocurrency investment.

2992
02:57:32.76 --> 02:57:33.76
So investment.

2993
02:57:33.76 --> 02:57:34.76
And I'm up 30%.

2994
02:57:34.76 --> 02:57:36.76
That's all I'm going to say about it.

2995
02:57:36.76 --> 02:57:39.76
So like, all right, yeah, hate to give him the credit for that.

2996
02:57:39.76 --> 02:57:40.76
But you can't help it.

2997
02:57:40.76 --> 02:57:41.76
Yeah.

2998
02:57:41.76 --> 02:57:42.76
Yeah.

2999
02:57:42.76 --> 02:57:42.76
Good.

3000
02:57:42.76 --> 02:57:45.76
Well, you can find us on the interwebs.

3001
02:57:45.76 --> 02:57:47.76
Deco is at Echo Charles.

3002
02:57:47.76 --> 02:57:55.76
And I am at Juggle Willink and finally thanks to everyone that makes this podcast possible.

3003
02:57:55.76 --> 02:57:58.76
First our military.

3004
02:57:58.76 --> 02:58:05.76
Whose strength and true warrior culture allows us the freedom to do what we want to do.

3005
02:58:05.76 --> 02:58:16.76
And thanks to the police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics first responders who are

3006
02:58:16.76 --> 02:58:19.76
ever vigilant and always ready.

3007
02:58:19.76 --> 02:58:24.76
I was just driving back from Yosemite and their big force fires up there.

3008
02:58:24.76 --> 02:58:30.76
And all kinds of people had signs out saying thanks to the firefighters.

3009
02:58:30.76 --> 02:58:34.76
So thanks for you guys up there in the mountains fighting the fires.

3010
02:58:34.76 --> 02:58:49.76
And to the rest of you that are out there working, building, making and squeezing every ounce of life that you can.

3011
02:58:49.76 --> 02:59:02.76
Crushing every minute of every day out there leading in the face of adversity and doing everything you can to be everything you can.

3012
02:59:02.76 --> 02:59:07.76
To all you, thanks for being in the game with us.

3013
02:59:07.76 --> 02:59:10.76
And thanks for getting after.

3014
02:59:10.76 --> 02:59:16.76
So until next time, this is Echo and Juggle.

3015
02:59:16.76 --> 02:59:33.76
Out.
