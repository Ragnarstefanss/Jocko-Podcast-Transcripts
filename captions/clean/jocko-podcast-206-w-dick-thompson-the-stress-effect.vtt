00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 206 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And back for a third time is Henry Dick Thompson. I have to throw Henry in there just to make sure when people look for your book they'll be able to find it.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So Dick Thompson, Sawgwarger, was on podcast 203 and 204. If you haven't listened to those, just go and listen them immediately.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And you'll realize the magnitude of the fact that this individual is sitting here alive talking to me is just an absolute miracle.

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So go listen to 203 204 where you can hear about Dick's experiences as a Sawg team leader and team member in Vietnam.

6
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Where we left off was home from Vietnam and now checking in as a Ranger instructor, which for you was a great deal because you were going to have the opportunity to take.

7
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And then you listened to the Rangers and also home them for your own experience because you figured you were eight months away from going back to Vietnam.

8
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yes. So this was my opportunity to get ready. And so I could be more focused next time. I could do a better job.

9
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now when you said eight months, what was that based on? What was that when you say I was probably going back over in eight months? What was that based on?

10
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:50.000
At that time, that was about to turn around right. You come back from Vietnam. They give you a little time to recover and you know, eight months or so you're going to get orders to go back again.

11
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And you're now, did you make captain yet? Or are you still?

12
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Yeah. I'm like captain.

13
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So now you made captain.

14
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You must be looking around at the guys that you deployed with and that you knew. I mean, you must be missing a lot of guys now. I mean, wounded, killed or missing an action. This has got to be just a tremendous number for you.

15
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
When I look at the ones that that I knew that I consider teammates. I mean, we did things together.

16
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We knew each other. I have a list that I run for 35 names. Those are just the ones that I considered. You know, my personal friends and teammates. Now, seeing in. We lost a lot more people than that. I just, I didn't know them very well.

17
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But just the time I was there, you know, I got 35 names. I run for.

18
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And you got to have that in your back of your mind when you're training these young Rangers. You know what they're getting into. Even if it's not saw. You know, you want to prepare them to the best of your ability for what they're going to face.

19
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah, because I knew at that time, I mean, that's, they were going to be at nine.

20
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I mean, there was no, no doubt, especially if they made it through the Rangers school.

21
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I mean, they were going to the question for me was, in addition to the personal things that I wanted to do, like, you know, improve my skills. What could I do for these guys to help them have a higher chance of surviving once they get there.

22
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So I kind of made that my mission. So you got, you got the normal instruction from a Ranger instructor plus.

23
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Then I added other things on it. And I said, you got to do this. We're not going to do this. This is how you talk business. I lead.

24
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So they got a lot of extra coaching and training whenever I led their group. And I just, I felt responsible to do that.

25
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
What were some of the leadership principles that you focused on teaching the young Rangers?

26
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Some of it was, you know, you got to be accountable. These are your guys. You got to be accountable. You got to take responsibility. If you're going to lead them, you got to make sure you know what you're doing. You got to be physically fit. You got to be mentally fit. You need to know the tactics techniques.

27
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You need to be done for some. You need to encourage them. You need to build a team. You need to take care of them. You need to know everybody on your team. If you've got to put tune, you need to know everybody in the put town.

28
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And at that time, the army used to do issue a little green notebook pocket size notebook hardback that you put in your pocket.

29
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You know, every town, you need to have your people in here. You know, in peace time, you need to know who they are. Know something about them.

30
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So you can relate to them when they're having problems and how to train them, you know, the best. Know what their weak areas are. How you can build them up.

31
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Because you're accountable for them. There you are, people. And you're the guy that's the leader. You need to be the first one out there. And, you know, for me, I'm not going to ask you to do something I want to.

32
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I'm not going to go to you and say, pop out the door there playing here. If I'm not going to do it, you know, I tend to do more of follow me.

33
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
You know, I'm going out there. I'm going to do it too. And I'm going to set the example for you. This is how I want you to do it.

34
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so you're trying to get that through to them and trying to get through in terms of think of yourself as a professional.

35
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Think about your medical doctor.

36
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Every day you should be reading, learning, studying, getting better. Every technique that you know, you should be trying to improve it. Every day is about practice.

37
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Whatever it is that you're doing, ask you, is there somebody else better than you than you need to be practicing?

38
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You know, you got to get as good as the best because you want to be that person. And you don't get there by just wishing, hoping. You got to get out and take the action.

39
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Some of the things that you're going to be doing, particularly if we think, Ranger, special forces, seal.

40
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
A lot of stuff to mind set. Some mind set. You've got to think like that.

41
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You can be in the greatest physical condition in the world. But if you don't have the mindset, you can't do it.

42
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And you guys are already seeing here in Ranger's go, how many of your buddies have already dropped out?

43
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
When I went through Ranger's go, we started out with 248 people.

44
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
When we finished, we had 175 actually make it to the end of the course.

45
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000
75 of those got a Ranger down. Rust them didn't. So they only 75 Rangers, you know, produced. And it was mindset.

46
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It wasn't that they were bigger, stronger, faster. They had the mental capacity to keep going on one meal a day, three hours, sleep at night,

47
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:33.000
keep pushing and still be able to think cognitively enough to put together a good tactical plan to communicate that plan and execute that plan.

48
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And it takes work. And you need to be the leader. So people follow you.

49
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So, you know, whatever it is that I'm going to do out there that I expect you to do, I want to be doing it to the most of my ability.

50
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
If you're going to jump out of an airplane with a rope tied onto you to pull the parachute out, I'm going out from 30,000 feet.

51
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Hey, law.

52
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And that's what I do. If you have to have a landing on the size of a football field to get into, I'll cut it down to a third of that and do it in a dark.

53
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
You know, I want you to say it can be done better. And if you can beat me, more power to you.

54
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Because now what you've done is tell me, I need to practice more. But you're going to make a word for it.

55
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yeah.

56
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yeah.

57
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's the part that you said about being a professional and when I talk to young seals or young marines or soldiers or airmen, sailors, whoever, you know,

58
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I always say, I always say, you're a professional. And then I tell, this is your life.

59
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This right here is your life.

60
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Everything else is secondary to what you're doing right here. And you need to study, you need to learn, you need to read, you need to practice, you need to rehearse, and you need to do that all the time, because you're never going to be good enough.

61
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And you need to make this right here your life.

62
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You got a couple other notes in here.

63
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
One of them just says, staff sergeant, Shelley.

64
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
What's that all about?

65
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:19.000
When I went through rangers go in the mountain phase, there was an African American ranger instructor there called Sergeant Shelley.

66
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Hardcore.

67
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Hardcore did rarely to leave pass anyone on patrol.

68
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And I had him, he graded me one time on my pass.

69
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
When I came back from Vietnam and went to the ranger department, I ended up in the mountains, he ended up on my team.

70
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So now I've got the famous Sergeant Shelley on my team.

71
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I thought, man, this is cool.

72
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We go on a patrol where I'm grading a patina leader. He's grading a patina sergeant.

73
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It's 18 degrees outside. Shelley shows up, which he got his fatigue showed on, but he's got his sleeves rolled up.

74
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And he said, where's your Parker?

75
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I don't know how to Parker. Where are your gloves? I don't need gloves.

76
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It's 18 degrees.

77
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
He said, okay. I'm fine. Hard, dude.

78
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And then we're out on patrol. The snow is almost in the ED.

79
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Greg and the rangers threw it. They're tired. They're cold.

80
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And so I call the next patrol leader. Next person's just going to take over the patina.

81
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And I say, all right, Ranger.

82
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Take after him out.

83
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And I want you to show me 10 digit coordinates to where we're standing right now, because you've got to know where you're starting from.

84
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And he kind of looks at me and I said, take your map out.

85
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I don't have a map, sir. Why don't you have a map?

86
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
He said, well, Sergeant Shelley took my map when we stopped back there and we had to go ahead, man, because of the guy getting a frostbite.

87
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He took my map. We didn't go and Sergeant Shelley to give you a map back. Tell him you did it.

88
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I can't do that. That's why not.

89
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So, sorry, he built a fire with my map.

90
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I said, okay, then you need to find somebody here that's going to loan your map.

91
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You're going to be the patrol leader. You got to have a map.

92
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Back then, you could do a lot of things that you can't do now.

93
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Sergeant Shelley would take onions, cut them in half, rub them all over.

94
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
He would eat garlic. He would take in some Kentucky fried chicken with him and the bag.

95
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so when it was dark and the reindeer students, you only had to feed them once every three days back then.

96
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
They put got to call them resupplies. They didn't get any food.

97
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Or if they called them for resupplies and they didn't ask for food, they just got ammunition.

98
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So they were always hungry.

99
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And you get under a poncho at night.

100
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And it's actually, all right, Andrew, show me where we are on the map.

101
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And the ranger would start to pour out where we're at.

102
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And nobody under the poncho can breathe.

103
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You know, Shelley smells so bad. You just seconded her breath, her eyes are watering.

104
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And the gas starts to pour out the water. They are on the map.

105
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And he drops his chicken leg on his finger.

106
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
He says, don't you touch that chicken leg.

107
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Don't you dare lick your finger.

108
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Now, show me where you are.

109
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And he do things like that to him all the time.

110
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And he was, he would very good.

111
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But he would very hard.

112
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And then as I started to develop a similar reputation,

113
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
they would hear about it for bending.

114
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And when they got to the mountain face and Shelley and I would walk in to take over the patrol

115
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
for the next 24 hours.

116
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And we did introduce ourselves. You could see the looks on their face.

117
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Well, no. One's bad enough. We got both of them at the same time.

118
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
No one's going to pass.

119
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But yeah.

120
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
That I mean, Shelley is super guy.

121
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Really smart.

122
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And got another name down here. Bob Howard.

123
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Bob Howard, Medal of Honor winner.

124
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
He was sawed down at the contume.

125
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And wounded like 13 times eight purple hearts.

126
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
He was a tough guy.

127
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And he came up in a fluvial recline with us one time.

128
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And I had already heard some things about him.

129
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I thought, man, I'm kind of nervous about getting an helicopter with him.

130
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Because, I mean, he just draws boards.

131
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I mean, I'm sure he's going to save most of us.

132
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But you know, I might not be one. He's the hard dude.

133
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And then he came to Granger School when I was an instructor.

134
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So I liked him. He came through Ranger School.

135
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah. So he came back from Sog.

136
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And it was coming through Ranger School.

137
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And I ended up grading him.

138
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
You know, sign him.

139
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
How many did I?

140
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I did a great job.

141
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But he was a hard dude.

142
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And then we went to the infantry officer at Vance Course.

143
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
He was the, the, the, a company commander of my class.

144
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You know, so we were there for a year together like that.

145
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You know, he didn't believe in foul language.

146
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You got to clean your language up if you were in his organization.

147
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Did a lot of things.

148
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You know, he was promoted to captain.

149
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And retired as a full kernel.

150
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I ran to here at Vance School for a while.

151
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I did all, it's all kinds of things.

152
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But you know, he in 11 months he was put in for the Medal of Honor three times.

153
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Got it. Got it once. Got, you know, the DFCs for the other.

154
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
A warrior.

155
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
At one time, he was, I think he was the most decorated person on active duty.

156
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And then, you know, after him, I mean, he got cancer.

157
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And passed away. And then I think, um,

158
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Bargewell kind of took over as a most decorated for a while.

159
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So hardcore, song guy.

160
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So at what point did you decide this is going to be your career?

161
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Have you already decided that or you still thinking, well, I'll do another tour of Vietnam or

162
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Yeah, I'm in, you know, yearning.

163
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But the time I got to was.

164
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I mean, you know, what would I do if I got out?

165
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Yeah, well, I want to go do some other things.

166
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And the interim, I'll do the, the Ranger stuff to get ready to come back.

167
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'll do another tour here.

168
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And then figure out, you know, where I go from, you know,

169
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Sog.

170
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So now it's 1970.

171
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
All right.

172
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And are you seeing the war wind down yet?

173
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Or not really.

174
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
It's still still going pretty strong from where I am.

175
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So I'm still expecting to get orders anytime.

176
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And, you know, that happened.

177
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
But before that happened, I was,

178
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I got a call from Dick Meadows one day.

179
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And he said, this is me.

180
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I can't tell you anything.

181
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It's out.

182
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You're going to get orders.

183
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And you really want to do this.

184
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I need you.

185
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Click.

186
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
So then I got orders to go somewhere on temporary duty.

187
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Another kind of Ranger department got it.

188
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And Meadows was in the Ranger department at the time.

189
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And he'd already been moved out on temporary duty for some reason.

190
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And then two more of us get orders like that.

191
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
The Ranger department commander said,

192
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
What's going on?

193
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Somebody better tell me what's going on.

194
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I was just wondering about what was going on.

195
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
They canceled our orders.

196
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Mine and the other guy.

197
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Because of the security.

198
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
They didn't want people asking questions about something.

199
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
It might be going on.

200
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So several months later,

201
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
that was the raid and to North Vietnam and to San Te.

202
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
To the POW count.

203
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So, you know, I had been picked for that.

204
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And, you know, just didn't get to go.

205
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Unbelievable mission.

206
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Probably one of the most successful missions we ever had.

207
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Except no, no prisoners.

208
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Right.

209
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
They had just been moved.

210
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But the training, the knowledge and stuff that came out of that.

211
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And the way those guys trained.

212
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And you know, having to build the POW count every night.

213
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And the darkness.

214
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So they could practice on it.

215
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Because they're doing the same thing.

216
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So they could practice on it.

217
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Because they'd turn the Russians out of light.

218
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Could see it.

219
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So you had to time all of that stuff.

220
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And then talking about practice.

221
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Once they figured out how they were going to do the mission.

222
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
They practiced the mission over 170 times.

223
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And it took a long time to do a mission.

224
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So it was the most of the night.

225
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And they were just every day.

226
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Every night they'd go practice that mission.

227
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And you know, training during a day with their skills.

228
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Everybody knew their job.

229
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I mean, one of the guys when they landed in the compound.

230
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
One of the guys job was to take out a guard tower.

231
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And the helicopter was going to land.

232
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And he had a certain number of steps to run to to get down behind a big tree that was there.

233
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And then use that as cover while he took out the guard tower.

234
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
He got a helicopter lands.

235
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
He runs over, gets down, kneels down, starts firing, taking out the guards up there.

236
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And then something says, hey dude, there's no tree here.

237
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Where's your tree?

238
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And it had been cut down.

239
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
But he was right where he was.

240
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
But if the tree had been there, he was in the right place.

241
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
He had rehearsed it so many times.

242
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And all the stuff was like that.

243
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
You know, you got digmettos out there doing his thing.

244
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So anyway.

245
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Then when did you get orders to go back?

246
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I'd been there about eight months.

247
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And I got orders to go back.

248
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I had actually signed out and was starting to go on leave.

249
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I was going to go there three days a leave before you have to go.

250
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And then I got orders revoked in those orders.

251
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Because at that time to be an instructor in a range of department,

252
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
you had to have combat experience.

253
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And they're running out of people with, particularly officers with combat experience,

254
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
because they're getting out.

255
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
So they put an operational hole on myself.

256
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And I think about three or four other guys that said, no, you're not going anywhere.

257
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
You're going to stay right where you are.

258
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Keep doing what you're doing.

259
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So I was already set to go back to go to Sog.

260
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Everything's set up.

261
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And then they say, no, you're going to remain in place.

262
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So how long did you end up staying as a Ranger instructor?

263
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
A little over three years.

264
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Yeah, long time.

265
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
And now you definitely are seeing the war wind down.

266
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I'm seeing the war wind down.

267
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I'm seeing the protest.

268
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I'm seeing a lot of different things now.

269
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000
But still very, you know, proud to be in the military, proud to be a Ranger,

270
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
especially forces and whatever.

271
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
So I'm not thinking about getting out now.

272
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And you got married sometime around this time, Frank?

273
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That deal was confirmed right after I got orders revoking the trip back to Vietnam.

274
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So, yeah, that's how I got married.

275
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
You got confirmed.

276
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Yeah.

277
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Yeah, because what I had said was it would probably be better.

278
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Let me do the tour.

279
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And when I come back, you know, then we can get married.

280
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Rather than, you know, something happening to me.

281
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And you become in a widow and all that kind of stuff.

282
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Let's not do that.

283
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
But once my orders were revoked, then okay, now we can move forward.

284
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And then your next tour was went to Korea?

285
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Yes.

286
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Well, I went to the advanced course down at Benning for a year and went from there to Korea.

287
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
What do you do with the after-off course course course course?

288
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Yeah.

289
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And that's to prepare you to be a company commander?

290
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Company commander or, yeah, really, start moving you out toward the next level.

291
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
If you're going to get promoted, you know, you got to go to the advanced course.

292
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And that's one of the Bob-I, where you stay on there.

293
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
There are some other people from Saag that I knew there.

294
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And with an interesting to see the guys like the guys from Saag, the guys from special forces,

295
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
in there, now they're teaching the company commanders for infantry.

296
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000
What kind of, what kind of lessons we're going back and forth from those two elements?

297
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000
You know, when you're being there, I learned a lot about, you know, just to mechanize units and things like that.

298
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
You know, because I had never been in one.

299
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I've been in, you know, some kind of special ops group.

300
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I didn't understand about people outside of special ops.

301
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
I didn't understand about someone that you could say, okay, we got to get this accomplished this afternoon.

302
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And so I did drones. And this afternoon I go, look, and it's not done.

303
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
What? How could that happen?

304
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
I mean, you tell a special ops guy, I mean, this needs to be done.

305
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I mean, it was a different mindset, different.

306
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I'm not trying to demean anybody that wasn't in special ops, but it's a different mindset.

307
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So getting used to that when I got to Korea, I had, well, ahead of time, I had a lot of things.

308
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I had a time I had written a letter to the commanding general.

309
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I found out I was going to the second after division.

310
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And he was probably else I.

311
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
So I had written a letter to him and said, you know, I'm coming.

312
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
I want to command a company, but I want to command a Ranger company.

313
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I think the second after division could benefit from a position or Ranger company.

314
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
So what I'd like to do is take over a company and let me convert it.

315
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And, you know, if anything happens with North Korea, I'm out there.

316
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
You know, you put us on there first and we'll go do it.

317
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
And the created a lot of controversy with the staff and other people that found out that I had written a commanding general letter.

318
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And in fact, in the battalion, that was assigned to, there was a couple of weeks there before I got to take over the company.

319
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
The battalion commander brought me in, you know, right off the bat and he said, let me tell you something Thompson.

320
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
You never been in a real army unit.

321
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
You won't last a month.

322
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
You'll be relieved if you're a command within a month.

323
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
You're a snake eater.

324
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
You don't know how we do things.

325
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And you're not going to survive here. And I'm sorry that I'm not going to be here to see it.

326
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
But, you know, I'm leaving Korea in about a week or so.

327
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
But my replacement will see you.

328
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And I thought, yeah, that's a motivational way to greet the new guy coming in.

329
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So anyway, a company called Bunky Bravo.

330
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
It became my company.

331
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And within a few days, we painted the wall of the building, you know, black and gold.

332
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
It became Bravo Rangers.

333
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And we had a game there. There's a call combat football.

334
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
You had 40 people on the field from each team with two balls in play at the time.

335
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And you had to have 40 people per side.

336
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah.

337
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And you had 10 substitutes that you could use.

338
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
So before I took over, I went down and I got a new first sergeant.

339
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
He and I came in at the same time.

340
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
So let's go down and watch him play this combat football game.

341
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
See what's going on. So we go down.

342
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Bravo company couldn't get enough people on the field to play the game.

343
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
They had to force it the game because nobody would go out there.

344
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
So you know, if it doesn't people and I'm thinking, why?

345
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Why are they not going out there?

346
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
And I told the first sergeant, as a top, when we take over, things are going to change.

347
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Yeah.

348
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
This company is going to see the world differently.

349
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
So once we took over, we had a combat football game a couple of days later.

350
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So took the company down to the field.

351
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And they're all standing there and I walked out onto the field and I faced them.

352
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And I said, okay, I'm number one.

353
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Top where I get first sergeant went right and out.

354
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And I said, okay, top, you number two.

355
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Where are my loot tenants?

356
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
loot tenants get out here.

357
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Okay. Now we got some more players.

358
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Where do they in see it? Why are there no NCOs out here?

359
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
All the NCOs get on the field.

360
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Okay.

361
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Top figure out how many spaces we have left in case some of the troops are going to play.

362
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Boom.

363
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
There are all I don't know if I'm going to fill one in the play.

364
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I said, man, they have all the officers and NCOs are going to play.

365
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Yeah.

366
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And it's like we were talking about before.

367
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I'm not going to put you on a game like that where you could break your leg or something.

368
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
If I'm afraid to go out there.

369
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
You know, if that's leadership, you get out there.

370
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Follow me.

371
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
I'll say, hi, I have to do it.

372
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I might not be the best player on the field.

373
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
But I'm going to give it my best.

374
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
One division championship twice.

375
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I was there.

376
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
How did two parts when you took over Bunky Bravo?

377
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I'm a match.

378
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
He was a pretty slack attitude for them.

379
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And sometimes people get the impression, oh, well, when you come in like that, you've got to drop the hammer on everyone.

380
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
How did you balance, drop in the hammer and everyone creating a distance between you and them?

381
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And actually, you just described one way that you did it, which is, hey, I'm going to be the first one out here.

382
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I'm going to be going to lead from the front.

383
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Was there any other techniques as a leader that you utilized to turn that, to turn the, the, the folks that forfeited matches to the folks that win the championships two times?

384
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
There were several things that happened.

385
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:22.000
As you can imagine, with Bunky Bravo, there was a lot of drugs uses, particularly marijuana.

386
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So I was walking through the company area.

387
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I was talking about a week before I took over, and I was walking about a barracks, and I was, the window was open, and I was listening.

388
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And they were talking about this new guy coming in as company commander.

389
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And they were talking about, you know, we have to get rid of him.

390
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And they were talking to a Korean guy.

391
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And they were talking about what's it going to cost us to have something happen to him.

392
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So I hear that for a little bit, and then all of a sudden I just kicked the door open, and I stepped in.

393
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
And I said, you know, we haven't met yet.

394
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I'm Captain Thompson, and I'm curious.

395
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Do you have enough money to pay this guy to take me out?

396
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Because if he don't, let me loan you some money, so he can try to do that.

397
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
But you'll notice, you know, drugs are going to be out of here.

398
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Everything's going to change around here like that.

399
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So you get with the program, you're in good shape. You want to use drugs.

400
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
You're going to have a real problem.

401
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
And I'll fast forward just a little bit, but what I found was, you could catch someone with mirror

402
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Wanted, and then as a company commander, I could find them.

403
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I could take their money, I could reduce their rank, but I know that has no meaning to them.

404
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
So then I thought, what are they value the most?

405
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
They're free time.

406
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
So, you know, the guy gets caught marijuana and he comes in.

407
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And he said, how much does it's going to cost me, sir?

408
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
I said, I don't want your money.

409
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
And I said, I don't want your money.

410
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
But at 1700, you report here to the first sergeant.

411
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I said, look out my window.

412
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You see that big creek right next to the area here.

413
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Yes, sir. I said, you see all those rocks on the creek bank on the other side.

414
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
As a yes, sir.

415
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
I said tomorrow they're going to be back on this side.

416
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
What you can't do that, I said, okay.

417
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I can give you extra duty.

418
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And that's what's going to happen every night for a while.

419
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I can give you seven days of extra duty.

420
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And you won't be going to the village.

421
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
You know, words spread like wildfire.

422
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But he's crazy man.

423
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You know, he doesn't want your money.

424
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
He's going to keep you here.

425
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Look, when rocks back in the hall.

426
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
So we started to get the drugs out.

427
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Things like that.

428
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
You know, we had the combat football.

429
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
I was able to get helicopters.

430
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So we could, you know, they got to play with helicopters.

431
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
They got to learn how to build bridges.

432
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
We put on a demonstration for the president when he came over.

433
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
There are different things like that.

434
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And then one of the techniques.

435
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
I know this.

436
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Excuse me, this won't show up.

437
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But I just want to give you an example of the power of motivation.

438
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
And I get in trouble here.

439
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Yeah.

440
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Company formation.

441
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And I said, all right, you guys need to understand.

442
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
You belong to Bravo Rangers.

443
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
You're better than anybody else here.

444
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
You can outperform them.

445
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
You can out run them.

446
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
You can out do whatever.

447
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
This is a special company that you belong to.

448
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And arrest them done.

449
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
So when I finish talking, I want you to report to the Versaegean.

450
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And he's going to issue you a Bravo Ranger card.

451
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And this card says that you are a member of Bravo Rangers.

452
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
And you need to understand if anyone in this company, including myself,

453
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
catches you down in the village and says, show me your card.

454
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
And you can't produce it.

455
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
You're going to buy everybody at that table around of whatever they're drinking.

456
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
And also understand if you lose this thing, you have to come to me to get a new one.

457
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And explain to me how you lost it.

458
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I won't say necessarily on the podcast here.

459
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
What it says on the back of this card, the online.

460
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Let you look at the back of it.

461
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
There you got so excited about that.

462
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
That was the most valuable thing that they owned in the company.

463
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Well, I'll read one part of it.

464
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
You've never lived until you've almost died.

465
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And until you fight for it, life has a special flavor that only a Ranger will ever know.

466
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Bravo Rangers.

467
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
And then there's some various special activities that the

468
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Brawler Rangers are capable of executing.

469
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And they're not all legal, I'll say.

470
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So that's outstanding.

471
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And now, but the power hasn't happened to me for some time now.

472
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
But in the 90s, I mean, there's an increase in the 70s.

473
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And the 90s.

474
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I'd be walking through the air, but I'm allowed to airport.

475
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And a guy would say, hey, sir, you know, I'm, you know, Sergeant Jones or whatever.

476
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And he'd introduce himself.

477
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And the next thing out of his mouth was, you got your car.

478
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And he would have his car.

479
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
I mean, it was amazing.

480
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
How many people I would run into over the years.

481
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And one of the first things they would say, you got your car.

482
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I got mine.

483
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
They were still carrying these cars.

484
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I swam these in here.

485
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
If I say one case, first thing they're going to do is ask me about it.

486
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000
So that, you know, I'm a big, I don't know what the right word is.

487
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
But I learned a lot from David Hackworth, from Colonel David Hackworth.

488
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And one of the things that he did was rename the hopeless battalion in Vietnam that he took over into the hardcore.

489
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And like when I took over for tasking at Bravo at Seal Team 3 as the tasking at Commander,

490
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I immediately changed the name to Task Unit Bruser instead.

491
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Same exact idea.

492
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
And I've got a great email recently from a guy that had changed the name of his,

493
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
he's had a big construction company.

494
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And that his team changed the name of his team.

495
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And it like changed the attitude and all of a sudden they started completing projects.

496
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And just that little element.

497
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And there's an important part to it is you can't just change the name and expect like,

498
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Oh, now everything's different.

499
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
That's an element of it.

500
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
You have to do the other things.

501
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
You have to say, oh, we're going to work hard.

502
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
We're going to fight hard.

503
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
We're going to win this championship.

504
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
We're going to be the best here.

505
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
You can't just change the name and expect that to happen.

506
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
You're going to have to do work behind it.

507
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
You know, pride comes from, pride comes from struggle and an overcoming struggle.

508
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
That's what pride comes from.

509
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So when people ask me how do you develop pride in a team?

510
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Cool.

511
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
You want to develop pride in a team?

512
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
You make them do hard stuff.

513
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Hard training.

514
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Go through.

515
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
You know, even with military units that have bad,

516
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
that have battle streamers, that's, that's the pride that they've carried for 50 years,

517
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
a hundred years since they did whatever, you know, thing in World War One or World War Two or

518
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Career Vietnam, that's something that that unit achieved and that gives them pride.

519
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
So you can't just change the name and expect, oh, cool.

520
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I change the name.

521
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Now I'm good to go.

522
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
No, you need to change the name and then you need to give them something to be proud of,

523
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
which means some kind of struggle to get through some kind of pain to get through that

524
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
that not only doesn't give them the sense of achievement, it also brings them together.

525
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Right.

526
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Because when you, that shared suffering that you go through, whether it's boot camp or airborne school or

527
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
special forces selection or a hard training mission, all those things what they do is

528
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
bring it together and the ultimate form of that is, is combat, you know, which is why you can,

529
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
you can go through a, be a member of a guy that was in Saga and you reach out to tilt.

530
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
You guys never met before and all of a sudden, hey, yep.

531
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Well, we'll meet up at some point and you can move forward. You guys have that camaraderie because of what that unit

532
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
achieved and the struggles that you went through.

533
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So the other question I want to ask is, when it relates to going,

534
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
how do you keep that in check, at least, well, from your perspective for you,

535
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
because now all of a sudden, you got guys that are walking around with a chess boat out,

536
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
and you start get professional jealousy from the other company commanders and they're going to try and make you look bad

537
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
and they're talking behind you. How, how did you contend with that kind of thing and keeping your guys

538
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
from becoming arrogant, which is a possibility?

539
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
It's a real issue of big issue. And it also happens internally.

540
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.000
So we're out on a range practicing and we're out there for a week.

541
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
And all of a sudden, the first sergeant says, sir, you need to come with me.

542
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
We got a little issue going on out here. And there was a little bank that had a road on it.

543
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And there was a little road, you know, 30, 40 feet below.

544
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Third batoon, what's coming down the road?

545
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
First batoon was going the other way. Third batoon made some little comment the first batoon.

546
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And a hell of a rock came down. You know, it's, and you know, we had to go break up a rock fight

547
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
because they were so pumped and young. You're not better enough. You can't call us now.

548
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Oh, gee. You know, all right, guys. These are young people.

549
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
These are young people. The enemies outside the wire.

550
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And yeah, you can be fired up. But you know, and other company commanders,

551
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000
even another batagon commanders were upset because the general, I mean,

552
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000
I'd been there maybe a week. And all of a sudden, I mean, in command.

553
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And all of a sudden, the siren goes off.

554
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And the siren is deployed to your battle positions.

555
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And you don't know if it's real or not, it's just deploy.

556
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
So I run back down there. My head quarters and the first sergeants there and say,

557
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
okay, what's up? And he said, no, you got it in deploy to the battle positions.

558
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
I think you need to go to the battalion commander's office and find out which battle plan

559
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
we're implementing. Don't worry about the company.

560
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I know we have to be out the front and get in two hours.

561
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
We'll be there. You go find out where we're going and what we're going to have to do.

562
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I'll make sure we get everybody here. And we load up everything and take it with us.

563
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So I go get it and I come back and we're in the head of the whole battalion.

564
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So we're going to lead the old brigade out of camp,

565
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
over to the battle position this.

566
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
And just as we start to move, a Jeep runs over my radio operator's foot,

567
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
breaks his foot. So I go throw him in the, in the ambulance.

568
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000
But we go and we get, you know, lead a night, we get up on a mountain in the area that we're supposed to defend.

569
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
And we have to dig in, dig fighting positions and everything.

570
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
There's just getting daylight. I got everybody dug in and they were putting in the firing,

571
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
the stakes, aiming stakes and all that.

572
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And I hear this, what, what, what, and a helicopter pop up.

573
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000
So set stand on a ridge. This guy gets out and all I can see are those stars on his.

574
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
And he comes over and you know, I'm sleuding and he says,

575
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000
you know, Captain Thompson, I, I want to see your fighting positions.

576
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So he walks around the ridge and we talk about him and he's asking me,

577
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
quite, why did you put this one here? Why is it already like this?

578
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
I asked the, this is all the others in the fighting position. Some questions here and there.

579
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And you know, I take it about 30 minutes and he comes back. He gets in his helicopter and he leaves.

580
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And I said, wow, I wasn't expecting the division commander to show up all of a sudden.

581
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
It wasn't 20 minutes. Well, well, well, well, well, well, he's the helicopter back up there again.

582
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000
He gets off his balls of three-store steps out with him.

583
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And he comes to me and says, I want you to take us around. I want you to show him your battle position.

584
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000
So they get in the helicopter and I was here. I mean, he's ramping and raven to the whole division about how great,

585
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
you know, the Bravo Company looks and all the stuff and the pattern of a battalion commander going back and throwing my name out.

586
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And then he starts showing up at least once a week at my muscle.

587
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000
The division commander walks in the middle, company mouse all the breakfast on a regular basis.

588
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And you know, and he talks and we talk about the things I've got the company to do and what I need them to do.

589
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And you start to share that as, you know, you get to come to the company again.

590
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Why do you think division commander comes down here?

591
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Does he go to other people's mouse or something now? He's coming in a Bravo Company.

592
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Look around you. What do you guys do?

593
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I mean, you're ferocious at combat football. combat football is his thing. He invented it.

594
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And you guys are animals out there and he loves it.

595
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
And we won, you know, best tactical pretend and a contest it was had.

596
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000
I call private Johns out and I said, look, Johns won third place in the division,

597
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
a division, a Christmas card drawing contest. Third place guys out of 10,000 people in the division.

598
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
You got third place. I mean, it doesn't matter what we do. You guys are winners.

599
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
We can do it. We just keep this up.

600
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
And you know, so there's just constantly having things to do.

601
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
And like I said, we won the football championship twice.

602
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
We won the Tycon, Tycon Do Championship.

603
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
You know, I was a player coach on our team.

604
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And we won the championship in the division.

605
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
And just all kinds of things.

606
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Because they were so pumped up and they do whatever you'd pour them at.

607
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And they, it was like they couldn't lose.

608
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Next up, you know, you had to put up with the people who were jealous.

609
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Because he was down there with us all the time.

610
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
And you know, they sent us to, they sent us to be the immediate reaction force for the nuclear sites.

611
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
You had to rotate people through there.

612
00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
So you're on a 30 minute notice to deploy to where whatever nuclear site might be under attack.

613
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So I walked in and we were looking around and I'm looking at the battle plans.

614
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
And I'm saying, you know, this is pretty cool.

615
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
I mean, maybe they'll activate us and we have to go do something.

616
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000
And I said, you know, I would feel better if I could see the live ammunition that we have for the mission.

617
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Well, if you can't see it, it's, you know, it's got, it's in, they're in foot lockers.

618
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
The magazines are locked up. They have steel bands around them.

619
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
You can't really see it.

620
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
I say, get a pair of bulk colors.

621
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
You can't see it. Open those boxes up.

622
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Nobody had opened one of those boxes in 10 years.

623
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
The magazines were rusty.

624
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
The ammunition wouldn't feed out of it.

625
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Created a major stair when I reported that we needed new ammunition because it wasn't functional.

626
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000
A few days later, I said, you know, we got a battle plan here that says we're supposed to fly into this LZ up here and support around this nuclear site.

627
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
I said, get a helicopter.

628
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Get some choppers.

629
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
So let's load up the first pretend.

630
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I want to make that insertion.

631
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
You couldn't land.

632
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
The trees had grown up since that plan was written.

633
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
There was no wells either.

634
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
You know, so I reported that.

635
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
And the tanker commanders that Thompson back off.

636
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
We'll have to highlight the fine anything.

637
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Just back up.

638
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
You got me in so much trouble.

639
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
I said, it's not trouble.

640
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I mean, what if we had to do something?

641
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Yeah.

642
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So, you know, let's, let's a lot of stuff.

643
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Well, all those are also readers of lessons.

644
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And then after that, you go back to brag and emergency deployment readiness exercise evaluation for special forces and Rangers.

645
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
So you're like an innovator.

646
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
At this point.

647
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Yeah.

648
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
So all the special forces and Rangers came under the 18th Airborne Corps.

649
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
The division commander from Correa is now the 18th Airborne Corps Commander.

650
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
So did he call you out by name and bring you back there?

651
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Yeah.

652
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
So he, he had me brought there to do special projects and things.

653
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
So, and one of them was, you got to be on this scene.

654
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I want somebody that knows about special ops that can deploy.

655
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.000
You know, so I would show up at a range of Italian headquarters at two o'clock in the morning and the CQ of paper classified document that says,

656
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
we'll's up in two hours.

657
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And, you know, it's going to get out of the way because that place was going to come alive.

658
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And then I would go with them.

659
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
I would, you know, be one of the evaluators.

660
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
If they put in a halo team, I would jump with a halo team and evaluate them.

661
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
We'd take them on classified missions sometimes.

662
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
There's a lot of things that, you know, we would do with them.

663
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I just ate up because, you know, it was all special ops stuff.

664
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
So I got to do that. That was a lot of fun.

665
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And, you know, the sniper team came under us.

666
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
It's sniper all, it's sniper training.

667
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
It's full break. That was under us.

668
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
So I could go out and play with the sniper.

669
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
And, you know, shoot and improve my skills.

670
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
And so what are you at this point at this point at a U.M. major?

671
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Shoot.

672
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Are you still a captain?

673
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And then what about the next time that Dick Meadows called you up?

674
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
circa 1978?

675
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
He actually showed up at my house.

676
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Okay.

677
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
One better.

678
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I have several people like that that if they called or they showed up at my house, my wife was not happy.

679
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Because she knew they were there for one reason.

680
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
There was something they wanted me to do that she was not going to want me to do.

681
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
So a meta shows up.

682
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
I didn't know it was coming.

683
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
You know, pulls up in my driveway.

684
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I was outside that's all I'm in.

685
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
So we go talk and he said, I need you.

686
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
We're putting together a special group.

687
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
I need you to come in and be part of my cadre to help set this thing up

688
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:24.000
and also evaluate and train the people and be an operator in this group when we get it set up.

689
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And he said, I really can't tell you anymore than that.

690
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I was you to guy.

691
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
I want.

692
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
I said, that's it.

693
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Me right now.

694
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And he said, yeah.

695
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And I said, my wife is pregnant with a third child.

696
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
You know, I just saw my house here.

697
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
I just bought a house and the author and the Georgia.

698
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I just got accepted into the doctoral program and University of Georgia.

699
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And named off a bunch of things like that.

700
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
I can't just stop this process right here.

701
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
And he was not happy.

702
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And you know, his final comment.

703
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Tell me was, you hung up your guns.

704
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
So I haven't hung up my guns.

705
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I just need to delay it for about two years.

706
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Now I can come back and do anything you want.

707
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
He said, no, I need you right now.

708
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And that was the last time we had a face to face in the car.

709
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
That was it.

710
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
And the group he was setting up.

711
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Tell us.

712
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Tell us.

713
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Yeah.

714
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
That's crazy.

715
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Now what what had made you want to go to college.

716
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
And what were you going to study?

717
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:59.000
You asked me early on about going to OCS and only have a year and a half of college.

718
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:06.000
When I left to the second after division as a captain and came back to the states, I was assured

719
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Secondary's on promotion.

720
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I was going to make major we before any other captains in my year group and stuff.

721
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
It was a done deal.

722
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Promotion this came out and I was not.

723
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Which is not bad because many people, you know, a few people and you get a second there.

724
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
But I was not.

725
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000
So when I called, middle person and D.C. and said, what happened?

726
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
And I said, well, you know, you were not considered.

727
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
I want to.

728
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
You said, you know, first thing we did was we went through all the records and divided

729
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
into two piles.

730
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000
College degree, not a college degree.

731
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
You don't have a college degree.

732
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
You are not eligible. You weren't even looked at beyond that.

733
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
So that irritated me.

734
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
You know, look at my performance.

735
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
You know, why is that performing me and all those stuff?

736
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
So then eventually I talked to him and I said, you wasted all your luck, staying alive,

737
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
and combat.

738
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yeah, I guess I did.

739
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Yeah.

740
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Okay, and I'll go to school at night and I'll finish this degree.

741
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000
So I did, and once I finished as a degree, then I got a call from them saying,

742
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
how would you like to go get a master's degree?

743
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000
I said, you wouldn't let me get an undergraduate, but now you want to say me for a master's.

744
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I said, okay, I'm interested in that.

745
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
My plan was, why don't you want a master's?

746
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Let me find this school that has an ROTC program that I could get a follow on assignment to you.

747
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
After I finished the Master's program.

748
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
So what I do is I enroll in a PhD program, complete the master's along the way.

749
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
I'll have a two year or more assignment with ROTC.

750
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
I'll be able to finish out the doctorate.

751
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000
So next time you want to ask about education, I'll have it.

752
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
You can call me doctor master.

753
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
That's right.

754
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
So here I come. Like I said before, if you're going to do it, you do it.

755
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
You practice, you do what you have to do.

756
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
You take the lead.

757
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
And what did you get your doctorate?

758
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Psychology.

759
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
So I think we talked before about, I started out in chemistry.

760
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000
And I found myself on the battlefield leading men in combat.

761
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000
And I was kind of looking around and thinking, I need to learn how to motivate people.

762
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
I need to understand the psychology of motivation, the psychology of people.

763
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
If I'm going to be a leader, I need to learn about that, not chemistry.

764
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000
So when I went back to school, on a back school with psychology, so I could learn how to do that stuff with them.

765
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
And then in reality, I think I'm going for a circle.

766
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
And now I understand, it's the chemicals and things and you brain.

767
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Just driving all this other stuff.

768
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
If you deal with those, it's a lot you can do.

769
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
But, yeah, I got to do a lot of things.

770
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I helped put together the Air Land Battle 2000.

771
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
I were going to do war fighting in a 21st century.

772
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
I got to do all kind of research on sleep, on stress.

773
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
How are we going to fight?

774
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Because we were predicting in the 80s, we were predicting the next ground war was going to be a hundred hours straight.

775
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Before there was any break.

776
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
So how are you going to keep people awake that long and keep them effective to perform the mission?

777
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
How are you going to create high performing leaders, high performing battle staffs, high performing teams?

778
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
What does that mean?

779
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
So I got to go all over the place and meet really smart people and learn from them.

780
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000
And work on projects like that do a research like that.

781
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:20.000
A lot of which was used in some in the Faulklands, because I worked with the British Army staff on the head general at the time.

782
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
There's that we're not doing that.

783
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
They're just going to stay awake.

784
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
I said, they can't stay awake.

785
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Not that long.

786
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
So there's some things you have to do.

787
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
But you discovered that in the Faulklands.

788
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
You have to do something and keep them going.

789
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
And then the Gulf War, the ground face was a hundred hours.

790
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000
My brother, you know, butch, helicopter pilot, or Apache pilot, he didn't get either aircraft.

791
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
He would come in to refuel.

792
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
They would feed him.

793
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
You know, while the aircraft's rearm in refueling and sending him right back out.

794
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000
And you know, using some different things to excuse me, keep him away.

795
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
So anyway.

796
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
So then was the command and general staff college was that your final tour?

797
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
No.

798
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
That was one where, you know, my luck hit run out.

799
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
So when I finished, I was going back to a regular unit.

800
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And then they realized that I was the only infantry officer in the class that had a PhD.

801
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And the general, my there to combat on said, you're not going anywhere.

802
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
You're staying here to work with me on this airline battle staff.

803
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000
I need somebody that thinks like you do and has the combat experience and everything to work on this with me.

804
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000
So they kept me there for four years, counting the year I was in school.

805
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000
And then they called me up and said, how would you like to be the professor of military science at the University of Georgia?

806
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
So you go back and I said, when you call me, where's this coming from?

807
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000
And I said, well, actually the university is turning down everybody we send.

808
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Every applicant to be the professor of military science that you're finding a reason not to not accept him.

809
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
But they can't do that to you.

810
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
You've had an ROTC assignment there.

811
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
You've been there because of the department.

812
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
You got a PhD master's in PhD from there.

813
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
You know, academically you've got everything that's in, so your name's all all your stuff.

814
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And he says, they have to take you.

815
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
I think I'll try that.

816
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
They took me and I just finished up there.

817
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
I had started high performing systems,

818
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Connelly on the side is just something to play with.

819
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
But it started growing so fast.

820
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000
You can't have an engagement with a client.

821
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000
And then the general decides, I need you for a break for a meeting on Monday morning.

822
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
And you can't do that. I mean, you can't turn the clients down if you want to keep them.

823
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
So now I'm having a conflict.

824
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
So I decided, you know, 21 years, that's enough.

825
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I'll get out and go do the company because I've said the company to be able to do the kinds of things I like to do.

826
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I mean, I don't get the shooting people.

827
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
But they don't get shoot at me either.

828
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Which is also nice.

829
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Yeah.

830
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
But at that time, outdoor training was a big deal.

831
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Roads courses is a kind of repaid.

832
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Throwing the bribe patch.

833
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
I mean, I can do that stuff in my sleep.

834
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
And I enjoy doing it.

835
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
So we had executive jumping off cliffs and going down rivers and rafts.

836
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
And all those stuff.

837
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
That played out, you know, towards the end of the 90s.

838
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
People started saying, Ben, they're done that.

839
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
I'm on something different.

840
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
So, you know, we changed up a little bit.

841
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Yeah.

842
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:13.000
So somewhere along the way, you wrote the book, the stress effect, which I read and definitely has some,

843
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000
some really good information in it.

844
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
And I wanted to hit some of the information that you put in there.

845
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Just to kind of give people a feel for the book.

846
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
I'm not going to do as much of a detailed as well.

847
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000
As I would do with the document that we read about restaurant,

848
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
the restaurant, the last podcast.

849
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
But, you know, just to give people some feel for what your, what this book contains.

850
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
So I'm coming down here out of the gate.

851
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Researchers, Shelley Kirkpatrick and Edwin Locke State.

852
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000
It is unequivocally clear that leaders are not like other people.

853
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Leaders do not have to be great men or women by being intellectual geniuses or omniscent profits to succeed.

854
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
But they do need to have the right stuff and this stuff is not equally present in all people.

855
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
So, this is interesting because you're saying something that a lot of people don't want to hear,

856
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:15.000
right, which is, hey, there are certain leadership traits that you may or may not be born with.

857
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
And that's the reality of the situation.

858
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Now, I talk about this a lot too and I actually say the same thing and I have this,

859
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
and I'm just going to say that you're going to get different capabilities that you have as a human being.

860
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
And what you can do as a leader is if you have an area of weakness,

861
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
if you're smart, you'll bring people onto your leadership team that compliment your areas of weakness.

862
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
But you can only do that if you have the humility to admit that, hey, I'm not that great at planning or hey,

863
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
I'm not that great at paperwork or I'm not that good at talking to the troops.

864
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Whatever areas of weakness you have, if you can admit to them and bring people onto your team that can compliment that,

865
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
and say, hey, you know, I'm not great talking to the troops dick, you know, can you get out there and deliver the work?

866
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
And you go, yeah, I got it.

867
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
And that's fine as long as I can admit it.

868
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
But if I wanted to admit it, my ego's in the way, and even though I'm not good at communicating with the troops,

869
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I decided I'm going to want to ask you up there and do it, and I bumble around and leave them walking away,

870
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
not feeling confident about it, that's bad.

871
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:23.000
So this idea right here that we all get, you know, you're going to get some qualities, but you're going to be missing some too.

872
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.000
And so that's something we all have to admit.

873
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
You go here, you talk about learnability, which includes job knowledge skills and experience.

874
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:43.000
It's critical component of leadership and decision making, selecting a former GE executive just because she was an employee of GE to run a hospital corporation

875
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
or a publishing company does not make sense.

876
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Just because someone worked from organization without when outstanding reputation doesn't necessarily mean that individual become will become an outstanding leader who makes outstanding decisions,

877
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
especially if she does not have the learned ability for that role level and industry.

878
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000
This is not to say that high performing leaders can't successfully switch organizations and assume higher roles.

879
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
However, it's not a given.

880
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Right.

881
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Important point there, that I have a company where we place veterans into organizations and a lot of times people think, oh well, the person has veteran experience, so they're going to be a hundred percent good to go.

882
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And as much as I would love to say that, you can't say that.

883
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's why we do a screening process and we actually train them to for that transition.

884
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But this is the same thing. People just because people are from an organization like you know GE has that reputation for their leadership,

885
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
but that doesn't mean that that person is necessarily a good leader and you have to be careful of that.

886
01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And this section here, I have to say, was I found very interesting.

887
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Individual leader complexity find the person who can do the work.

888
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And so you can do this topic here.

889
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Simply put, leader complexity refers to a leader's ability to handle the requirements of his or her job,

890
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
depending on the size and type of an organization.

891
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Leaders job is often enormously complex.

892
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Two factors determine ability to work at a particular level of complexity, learned and innate abilities.

893
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So once again, you're talking about innate abilities, meaning that people have limitations.

894
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And you know, my big point to that, or my thoughts around that,

895
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
is that people that really have problems or the people that don't realize that they have,

896
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
limited that they have limited innate capabilities, which means everyone.

897
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
We all have things that we're not good at.

898
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
That people that can't admit that are going to have real problems.

899
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Now you get into this, all leaders have limitations to what they can learn and how far up the leadership ladder they can climb.

900
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Inmate ability as it pertains to leadership consists of four major factors,

901
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, motivation and personality.

902
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And this is the most, this is the section that I really was very interesting,

903
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
because I work with a lot of different leaders all the time, because I have a consulting company too,

904
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
and we work with leaders all the time.

905
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So this topic here of cognitive ability.

906
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Cognitive ability is how a leader processes,

907
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
organizes, stores and retrieves information,

908
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
thus determining how she creates the world she lives in,

909
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
makes sense of it, and acts on it.

910
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Cognitive ability is a key determinant of a leader's ability to be successful at different organizational role levels.

911
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Unlike learned skills, cognitive ability is not trainable.

912
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It is a hard-wired ability that unfolds through a natural maturation process across one's lifespan.

913
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000
A leader's cognitive ability determines how she approaches problem solving, decision-making,

914
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
and interpersonal interactions.

915
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Let's look at the general characteristics of cognitive ability going from high to low.

916
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So now you're starting to talk about the actual person that has high cognitive ability.

917
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And this is interesting, and we may have to come back to this one, that it's not trainable.

918
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That's an interesting statement, because I would think,

919
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and I've seen people get better at, you know,

920
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
coming up with simple solutions and dealing with stress.

921
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So maybe that doesn't fall into those things.

922
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Don't fall quite in the category of cognitive ability,

923
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
but here's what you say about the higher, the higher leaders cognitive ability is.

924
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The lower the need for consistency in the information being processed.

925
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
This is a very important thing, right?

926
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I'm going to read it again.

927
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
The higher a leader's cognitive ability level is,

928
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
the lower the need for consistency in the information being processed.

929
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
What that means to me is, and this is very, very prudent on the battlefield,

930
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
is like you're not going to get consistent information out there.

931
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And if that bothers you, if you can't wrap your mind around different pieces of information

932
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
coming in that are contradictory to one another, you're going to have a problem making your decision.

933
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
That's what you're saying right there.

934
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yes.

935
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You need to be able to have contradicting thoughts, ideas, concepts, information in your mind,

936
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
both of them at the same time, and still function.

937
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And they're opposites of each other, but you can still deal with that.

938
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's not going to stop you from moving forward.

939
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And you'll find a way to use that information to fit in with what you're trying to do.

940
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Yeah, the hopes that I have in going through this with a little bit of detail is that people recognize this.

941
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
People recognize what we're saying is, I wrote one of the books I wrote,

942
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I wrote the dichotomy of leadership.

943
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And it's about this idea that you as a leader are going to have different forces pulling you in opposite directions.

944
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And you need to learn how to balance those different opposing forces.

945
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
With just about every trait that we have, that's what you need to be able to do.

946
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So I hope when people hear this, that they say to themselves, oh, I get wrapped around the axle if two different pieces of information are opposing each other.

947
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
This is really important.

948
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I hope that even though it's not trainable, I hope that you can actually, when people get recognition of it, they can go, oh, you know what?

949
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I know what's happening right now.

950
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I'm hearing two different pieces of information.

951
01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:05.000
My tendency is just to want to focus on one or ignore them both, but I don't make a decision where I want to need to do is think about how both these things are actually true or possibly true.

952
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Are you going, and this is a great example, consider the question, do cell phones cause brain cancer?

953
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
You can find as many studies that say, it does as it does not.

954
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:25.000
At lower cognitive ability levels, most people would find the inconsistency in the research confusing.

955
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Their response would be, there must be a right answer.

956
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:40.000
The low cognitive ability leader may choose to ignore the data altogether or pick the dot data that support her position.

957
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
So there you go.

958
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Classical example, hey, look, there's got to be a right answer. We need to know what the real deal is.

959
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000
When, as you know, you can Google and right now, you can Google anything and you can get supporting data for any hypotheses that you have.

960
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And if you have low cognitive ability, whichever one you think is right, that's where you pull all that data to back yourself up.

961
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It says this, in contrast, the high cognitive ability leader understand that there is no single answer and tends to look at the implications of cell phone use in the organization or how to put in safeguards just in case the phones do cause cancer.

962
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000
She does not let the inconsistency prevent her from making a larger decision in which cell phones play a role.

963
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
So you can still function as you said.

964
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Almost any topic contains some level of data inconsistency.

965
01:07:39.000 --> 01:08:02.000
What financial markets are going to do in the future when the construction industry will rebound, which airlines will survive and whether we need more FAA-22 Raptors, which is currently the world's most advanced fighter, the key is that high cognitive ability leaders rise above the level of inconsistency and make decisions.

966
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
They're not waiting for everything to be perfect.

967
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And I would just add to that.

968
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:20.000
There's a level of cognitive ability that you get to where you realize there is no single right answer for anything.

969
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Therefore, any answer that you choose, any solution that you choose, will have a downside.

970
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
At some point in the future, there will be unintended consequences for whatever you choose now.

971
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:46.000
So, in a lot of cases with people who can think forward, they're looking at which unintended consequences am I willing to accept?

972
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You know, at some point, if I have enough time between now and then to begin to put in something that may counter that, I know they're coming.

973
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It's going to happen.

974
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But I want to make a decision we're going to move forward.

975
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It's worse not to make a decision because that's an unintended consequence too.

976
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
There'll be unintended consequences for no action.

977
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
You go on here, leaders with lower levels of cognitive ability are constrained by the information they receive.

978
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Infirmation must be consistent for them to make sense of it.

979
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000
High cognitive ability leaders by contrast rely on themselves to provide missing information, look for more novel information,

980
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and search across more domains to find information.

981
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Which is interesting.

982
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Search across more domains.

983
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000
There's a problem over here that's in a certain arena and a high cognitive figure will look at that arena and go, you know what?

984
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
That's reminds me of this other arena.

985
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And I can apply this and overlay it to this arena that I'm looking at right now and further my decision making process.

986
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Add color to it.

987
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The greater they show and this is again the high cognitive ability leaders, they show greater certainty in judging inconsistent information and are more focused on long term strategies than low cognitive ability leaders are.

988
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
But low cognitive ability leaders are looking at the short term game.

989
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000
The leader with high cognitive abilities uses multiple dimensions when processing information.

990
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:40.000
These multi-dimensional, this multi-dimensional approach creates a high probability that the leader will match some facet of herself with a facet of another person during interpersonal interactions.

991
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
This leader is more inclined toward a simulation of information about herself than a leader with a lower cognitive ability is.

992
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Thus, leaders with high cognitive ability show a propensity for receiving feedback.

993
01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
They seek out information about themselves or open the feedback and assimilate this information into knowledge about themselves.

994
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
This goes back to me talking about being a humble person.

995
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
If you're a humble person you can take feedback and you can put it into your world.

996
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And the other part that I found interesting about this is that the high probability, the high cognitive leader will match some facet of herself with the facet of other person.

997
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
When I'm having an discussion with you and you have a different perspective or you're opposing me.

998
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
You're arguing with me instead of me saying, no you're wrong.

999
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I will look at you and say, oh, what's what? Where are they getting that perspective?

1000
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Oh, I see where he's getting that perspective from.

1001
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000
That actually makes sense because he's on the front lines and he's doing this.

1002
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Oh, okay.

1003
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So I actually will put some facet.

1004
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I will match some facet of myself to you so that I understand your perspective better.

1005
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.000
With this expanded knowledge and confidence they can more easily find some aspect of others with which they can connect.

1006
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And this connection allows them to gain more feedback and knowledge.

1007
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Again, one of my things that I talk about all the time is just humility and how leaders have to be humble.

1008
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And which is actually one of the cool things that you said about barswell and we never talked about it, but you said, you know, he was really tough.

1009
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
He was super smart and he was humble.

1010
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
If those are those are the qualities you called out.

1011
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Yeah.

1012
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And that's what this represents to me.

1013
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
You continue here a liter with high cognitive ability,

1014
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
perceives herself as being more complex than the average individual.

1015
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000
In a decision making situation, she might delay longer and submit a more complicated decision.

1016
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Now, when I originally read that right there, I had a problem with it.

1017
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Because because one of the monstrous age-old mantras of leadership, combat leadership for sure is simplicity, right?

1018
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You got to keep things simple.

1019
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So I'm going to come back to that one because my immediate reaction to it was wait a second.

1020
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I don't know if I agree with that because we're talking about this person with a high cognitive ability.

1021
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's coming up with a more complicated decision.

1022
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
But I'll get back to it here.

1023
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Her interpersonal reactions tend to result in greater perceived similarities between herself and more senior people.

1024
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
She may perceive differences between herself and others more accurately than a leader with lower cognitive abilities.

1025
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000
This complex internal structure results in a greater perception of the external environmental structure,

1026
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000
which can manifest in interpersonal conflict.

1027
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So again, we have someone that can sense what someone else's perspective is.

1028
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And this is where I come back to the simple thing.

1029
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
The high cognitive ability leader recognizes when she is communicating with others who are at a lower or higher level cognitive ability.

1030
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.000
When talking to a lower cognitive ability leader, she recognizes that person's simpler language structure,

1031
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000
linear thought process, and shorter term focus, and will understand that the lower cognitive ability leader might not get what she's saying.

1032
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:17.000
So what that tells me take that one step further, what a really good high cognitive ability leader will do is take the complex answer and simplify it down.

1033
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So that this lower cognitive ability leader can actually understand it.

1034
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000
So even though it might be a more complicated decision, the lower cognitive leader below me doesn't need to know that,

1035
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000
they're going to get the simplified version that they can grasp and make sense to them and then move forward.

1036
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Continuing on, when she is talking to someone of equal or higher cognitive ability,

1037
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
she may find that the conversation moves faster and is more enjoyable and stimulating.

1038
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Low cognitive ability leaders tend to use fewer dimensions when processing stimuli, resulting in fewer and less complex information domains,

1039
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000
and a lower probability of matching some facet of themselves with that of another person.

1040
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And again, see, this is why I think it's important to talk about this because if you can't relate to other people,

1041
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
if you're having a hard time talking to people up the chain of command, talking to people down the chain of command, talking to your peers,

1042
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
if you're saying, oh, they don't get it.

1043
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
They don't understand how can they think that way?

1044
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
If you're thinking that, if that's going to be your mind, that's a little red flag that you are,

1045
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
it's a little symbol or a sign of low cognitive ability.

1046
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You're the one that's not getting it.

1047
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Yes, so when you get there, instead of continuing to point the finger outward, take a look at yourself,

1048
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000
and recognize the fact that there's you need to try and find some common ground with other people.

1049
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And the fact that you can't find common ground with other people is a sign that you have low cognitive ability, and that's a problem.

1050
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So I'm hoping, again, I know this can't be trained, but I'm hoping that when you become aware of it, you say, oh, that's me.

1051
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That's me.

1052
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And this is the worst part about this whole section.

1053
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
The worst part about this whole section is this.

1054
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000
What I'm hoping for is that the people with low cognitive ability will recognize that this is about them, right?

1055
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This is about me, okay?

1056
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I tend to do this sometimes. I can't connect with other people. I can't see their perspective, you know what?

1057
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
That's that's me. That's on me.

1058
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:52.000
That's what I'm hoping people say. Unfortunately, people with low cognitive ability have a much lower chance of actually being able to recognize this.

1059
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
So that's the problem. It's a catch-twenty, too.

1060
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Yeah, it is.

1061
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Continuing.

1062
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
They tend to contrast themselves with others that are and are less open to feedback.

1063
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Another great point. If you're not humble and you're not, again, I use the word humble.

1064
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
If you're not open to people telling you, hey, you know what you could do this better?

1065
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
That is an actual sign of low cognitive ability.

1066
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I hate to break the news, too.

1067
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The next one, in their interpersonal interactions, they tend to perceive themselves as being more similar to their peers and less similar to their superiors.

1068
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
They are predisposed to be more rigid and concrete in their thinking.

1069
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000
This is another. This is something that you can recognize in yourself. This is something I can recognize myself.

1070
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
When I'm going, no, we got to do it this way.

1071
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:56.000
No, this is the way it's going to be. That's an indication to me that I am tending towards low cognitive ability.

1072
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And what I need to do is open my mind and try some new things, accept some new ideas.

1073
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Otherwise, I'm putting myself on report for being a low cognitive thinker.

1074
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Let me, let me share one thing.

1075
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:28.000
If you're a high cognitive ability person, if you become angry, the tendency is for you to start to drop in levels.

1076
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
In terms of your response right now, the interaction right now, the more angry you get, the more you drop really low.

1077
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And when you hear people to argue, and very often, if they're angry, very often, they both drop way down here.

1078
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And that's where the problem is, we got to get you back up.

1079
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And you hear it all the time in meetings and between people, and just listen to what they're focused on.

1080
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Listen to the time frame that they're focused on.

1081
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Listen to the concreteness of what they're focused on.

1082
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And you can figure out where they are.

1083
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Now, how can we elevate? If you and I have in this conversation, and I'm down here, and I'm really, I've dug my heels in.

1084
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
You're just, you're just wrong, Jaco.

1085
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
It is, you know, it's not really wrong with you.

1086
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.000
If you can't see my point here, if I'm dug in down here, we're not going to be able to resolve this.

1087
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Yep, I just added a discussion on this with a client.

1088
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's like the best thing I can do when you say, I don't like this.

1089
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I don't like your plan, Jaco.

1090
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
The best thing I can do isn't, well, that's because you don't understand it.

1091
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The best thing you can say, well, hey, can you, can you give me some feedback on what you're doing?

1092
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
You give me some feedback on what it is you don't like about my plan?

1093
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Because now, instead of you digging your heels in and looking how you're going to strike me, you're actually looking to formulate a legitimate answer to a legitimate question.

1094
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And by the way, when you ask that question, I'm not just asking you this question, so I can trick you.

1095
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000
No, I'm legitimately asking for feedback because maybe you know something that I don't know or maybe you see something that I don't see.

1096
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So I immediately get us to start moving up that ladder again, instead of down where when you say, I don't like your plan, I say, that's because you've too dumb to understand it.

1097
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Right.

1098
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Where's that conversation going?

1099
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You dropped all the way down.

1100
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Yeah.

1101
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
You continue on here.

1102
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:34.000
The accuracy of their predictions, this is again, low cognitive, the accuracy of their predictions about others is directly proportional to the amount of information they have about others.

1103
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Their concreteness filters out more aspects of the external environment structure, particularly when they're under stress.

1104
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Low cognitive ability leaders tend to have a relatively narrow set of interests and knowledge domains, although they may have an in-depth knowledge in a few areas.

1105
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But consequently, they look for others who share one or more of their interests, unlike the high cognitive ability leader, they do not have a broad range of areas of expertise they can use to connect with others.

1106
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
The bottom line is that leaders with, and what that tells me is, hey, you know, I need to get outside my zone, right?

1107
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Cool. I like jujitsu and I like war.

1108
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But if that's the only people I hang around with, I'm not expanding my horizons.

1109
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So I need to go and play in a band and draw and write and hang out with people that are doing those other things as well.

1110
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:50.000
The bottom line is that leaders with high cognitive ability are able to possess greater amounts of information and operate more successfully in complex environments with a higher level of inconsistency and ambiguity.

1111
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Then can leaders with low cognitive ability.

1112
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
As they rise to higher roles, role levels in an organization, the problems they face become more complex and ambiguous.

1113
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
These leaders with high cognitive ability tend to perform well at upper organizational echelons.

1114
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So true. I mean, you can think about just a difference in any job, right?

1115
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Your frontline troops is concerned with, you know, this part of the manufacturing line.

1116
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000
It's relatively small. It's not a complex thing. And then the more higher up you get in the organization, the more complex decisions are being made and whatnot.

1117
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000
And the good thing is when we think about cognitive ability is there's a place for everyone.

1118
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You have a real need for everyone.

1119
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Someone has to do that day-to-day hour-to-hour work and be happy with it. Be good. Be happy.

1120
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Go home at the end of the day saying, yes, I knocked out out of the part above them.

1121
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You need somebody with a little bit more. That's really good at that level.

1122
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And, you know, so getting the right person into the right role level at the right time, because if we think about cognitive ability for a lot of people is continuing to change.

1123
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
So there's like a growth curve that you can see. You'll flatten out someplace.

1124
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:23.000
But as long as they're growing, they can take on higher and higher role levels as they cross those different thresholds.

1125
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Eventually they're going to hit a point where, I mean, this is it.

1126
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
They need to be happy here because if you move them up to the next one, they're going to fail.

1127
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Yeah, and what I've see with people is there's a certain spot where they go, yeah, this is where I'm at.

1128
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
And I'm comfortable in this area, not comfortable in a bad way of like on my comfort zone,

1129
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
but you start to move them outside that cognitive ability level and all of a sudden they're stressed.

1130
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah, because they're trying to make decisions on inconsistent information and it's too much.

1131
01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And you know what? That's like you just said, that's actually good because now we know what the limitations are.

1132
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And now you can focus on this cognitive ability level where you excel at, because by the way, you get somebody with really good cognitive ability.

1133
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
And you put them in a job that doesn't require as much.

1134
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Well, now they're going to be bored and you use a term in this book, which I had never actually heard before.

1135
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It's not burnout. It's the opposite burnout. It's called Rust Out.

1136
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So that's all good. And like I said, we work with all kinds of organizations.

1137
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And the other interesting point I got to make is the cognitive ability isn't doesn't measure your intelligence.

1138
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It measures a bunch of different things that and just like some people are more articulate and some people are taller and some people are shorter.

1139
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Like this is one of those things where some components combine together.

1140
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And you could have somebody that went to an Ivy League school and I know I got to see this in the Seal teams.

1141
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000
People that went to Ivy League schools, they scored super high on whatever IQ test there are.

1142
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Their cognitive ability is not high because they can't look at complex things. They get wrapped around minutia or whatever the case may be.

1143
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So this is a really interesting thing. I would like to think and maybe it's just because I'm a positive thinking person.

1144
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I would like to think that if a person has humility and they say, you know what?

1145
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:36.000
When I hear that when I hear it being described that having concrete ideas probably means that my cognitive ability is a lower.

1146
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Maybe I need to open my mind up a little bit and maybe they can.

1147
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I know that I saw leaders and I still see leaders.

1148
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I know for a fact I see leaders get better become better leaders and be able to look at complex things and and start to understand that information doesn't need to be perfect.

1149
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And even if I look at myself when I was when I first got to the Seal teams and I was a new guy, I couldn't look at a complex problem immediately.

1150
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Oh, okay, you know what? Oh, that these two pieces of information are kind of different, but I can make a sound decision that will make sense right now and we can make some adaptations later.

1151
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Got it. No, I would have been looking for hey, what's this writer is that right. I don't know which one. Okay, I got to move forward with it.

1152
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
So I think that that idea that you can improve it is a positive thing.

1153
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Even though it, I don't know. Does that mean it's trainable?

1154
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What happens is I, I'm growing and I cross a threshold and I don't realize it.

1155
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I don't realize that I have more ability all of a sudden because it is like a stair step.

1156
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000
It jumps up, it goes along, it jumps up and when it makes that jump, I might not realize it initially.

1157
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And so I might need a coach. I might need you to come in and work with me to help me start to use this increased ability that I have.

1158
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Because I don't realize how to do it. So, you know, we work with leaders a lot, helping them be able to take advantage of their abilities that they have.

1159
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Because a lot of times they don't know what, they don't know they can handle more ambiguity.

1160
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I think further into the future because in their job, they're not allowed to. You're in a role level where they keep pulling you back down to here,

1161
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:35.000
even though you have a lot more ability. So one of the things that we're looking at with people in an organization is are you working at your potential.

1162
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Do you have unused potential that if we could help you to start to use it, you raise the whole bar for the organization.

1163
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And performance, level for the organization goes up because now you're operating closer to your full potential than you were before.

1164
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000
We were doing immediate action drills. I was tasked with a commander, double two commander, two two two commanders were Seth and lay,

1165
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:19.000
lay, play for all the books. And may Seth was the other two commander, the Delta Ptun commander, and you know the deal with immediate action drills. There's a standard operating procedure. There's a place where you're going to go on a p-left on a p-right on a center p-le on a flank right on a flank left on there's there's positions for you to go into.

1166
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And so I was watching him in his p-tun and basically the call would get made whether it was him or whether it was the leading petty officer or whoever someone to make a call.

1167
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And I'd watch him and he would stay like in the precise position that the standard operating procedure dictates him to be in.

1168
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And so which meant that if he ran down the ravine and was facing the six foot wall of a ravine and couldn't see anything he was going to stand there because that's where you're supposed to be.

1169
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And I say hey man, what can you see right now? You know it's like well nothing. Well why don't you move a little bit? Well because that's not the standard operating procedure. Well guess what? You're the Ptun commander.

1170
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:14.000
You're okay. You can have someone fill in here right and you can go and you can crawl up this little this little part of the ravine and you can actually see maybe an out where you can direct your guys so you can get out of this cone of fire. How does that sound?

1171
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So that becoming aware that you're allowed to move that you're allowed to think that you're allowed to take action.

1172
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:37.000
And reminds me of what you just said about a leader being able to step up suddenly realizing that like a stair step up as soon as you realize that he's like oh oh I can move around and yes as a leader yes you can.

1173
01:29:37.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Talk about emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence focuses on the interpersonal and emotional aspects of innate ability it can be defined as a person's innate ability to perceive and manage his own perceptions in a manner that results in successful interactions with the environment and if others are present to perceive and manage their emotions in a manner that result in successful interpersonal reactions.

1174
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Emotional intelligence being able to read people. You talk about the innate ability to do this.

1175
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But can you learn it? To some degree. Okay good. I'm glad you said that because I've talked to people and help people.

1176
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Like let me give you a big hint on emotional intelligence to anyone that's listening. If you want to get better at it. Here's a good step to take. Be quiet and listen to what people are saying.

1177
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:43.000
You know when you actually shut your mouth and listen people will and you truly listen to what they're saying you can hear what their tone sounds like and pay attention to it.

1178
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:59.000
When you're not listening when you're on transmit instead of receive you're not going to you're not going to perceive as much about their emotional state at that time.

1179
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Which means you're going to react badly to it. So instead of being on transmit mode for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about when you're on a radio as a radio man when you're pressing that push to talk button your transmitting information.

1180
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Don't be on transmit be on receive that's my advice that'll improve your emotional intelligence in the next five minutes.

1181
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Motivation. Motivation is a combination of work aspiration.

1182
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:40.000
The role level the role level the leader aspires to reach a motivators what drives the leader to be fully engaged at work. Demotivators what cause the leader to lose interest in work and drive for results.

1183
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:48.000
The leaders need to achieve in general motivation is highly associated with job performance and promotability.

1184
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I think Jordan Peterson calls this conscientiousness like are you going to do your job.

1185
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:11.000
The personality. A leader's personality tends to be hardwired so that most of his core preferences for interacting with people gathering information decision making and general orientation to life change little over the course of his life.

1186
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000
You kind of get what you get.

1187
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
How often do you see people's personalities change?

1188
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Not much. We're asked all the time. You got a fix. You got a fix.

1189
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And we can work with him. We can smooth with all some of the edges.

1190
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But he's still going to be a co-chance when the dust cells.

1191
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
That's the sad fact that I've been dealing with for quite some time.

1192
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Here's what I have. Here's what I have seen.

1193
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000
One thing that I have seen people change personality from some kind of event that takes place in their life like usually a traumatic event.

1194
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Something happens. Bad, good.

1195
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Chants luck and they they end up it's not going to drastically change their personality.

1196
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Because over time people will be the gravity of their personality will draw them back to who they are.

1197
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000
But occasionally the times that I've seen personalities change the most is something happens.

1198
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And that changes their personality.

1199
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
But it's hard.

1200
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It's hard to change someone.

1201
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000
That's story about the what is it the frog and the scorpion and the frog says I'll take you over.

1202
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The scorpion says can we take me over and he says no if I take you over the river you'll you'll sting me and I'll die.

1203
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And he says no why would I do that we both die and they go across and of course the scorpion.

1204
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Stings is why do you do that because on the scorpion what do you think I was going to do so.

1205
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
The fundamental core of leadership is decision making.

1206
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Everything a leader does or does not do is the result of decisions.

1207
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Every day leaders are called upon to make decisions routine and non routine.

1208
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And then you say problem solving is just a series of decisions.

1209
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Good point.

1210
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
You have these steps.

1211
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
The seven step problem solving model one identify the problem two gather the information.

1212
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Three redefine the problem.

1213
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Four generate alternatives.

1214
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Of course is a action.

1215
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Five evaluate alternatives.

1216
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Six selected implement the solution seven evaluate the results and then back to one again.

1217
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:35.000
So that's what we're doing all the time and you talk about the Udalupe in here which we've talked about bunch on the on this podcast.

1218
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And then you talk about the other the loop that what is it the Pamma loop what's that loop.

1219
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000
That's where you're perceiving information which is so this one reminded me of the Udalupe right there they're very similar.

1220
01:34:47.000 --> 01:35:01.000
So you perceive information comes in your system you appraise it you know makes sense out of it which is like orient right so it's a very brilliant so those two are pretty close right perceive.

1221
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And and observe would be the P and the O.

1222
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And then you get to A which is what is it in the Pamma what is it's in for a s s.

1223
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And then you get to the appraise and that's very similar to orient.

1224
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Okay then what's the M then we we get into to the motivational part and then we get to get into the action.

1225
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And then we're back into loop again.

1226
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Yeah and you in the last one is action in the Pamma loop and in and in the Udalupe it's act.

1227
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So you go through you know kind of dissecting what these two the differences are the similarities and that's that's definitely an interesting thing because again.

1228
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000
See for me I always have this I guess positive outlook on things that.

1229
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
If you know something.

1230
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
You can at least try and apply it right so people do the Udalupe people do the Pamma loop.

1231
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
But they don't know it and so therefore when they miss it or they do it or they or they get caught in some.

1232
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Meaningless cycle of it if they don't know that that's what they're doing they can't even correct it but if you're aware oh you know what I'm I'm not acting.

1233
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That's why I'm sitting here I'm not acting so I need to I need to take action.

1234
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
So I think being aware of things just like being aware of low cognitive ability if you're aware of it even if you're aware of it.

1235
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Hopefully you can make some adjustments in your life to get it moving in the right direction you talk about.

1236
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Rational strategies which is.

1237
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Logical sequential analytical conscious well fought out process that takes time and typically involves others so this is hey we're going to come up with a rational decision.

1238
01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:02.000
For our problem and the other one is intuitive which is intuitive decisions are made quickly automatically emotionally.

1239
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Mostly unconsciously.

1240
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And this is the type of decision usually made in routine or emergency situations.

1241
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So these again these are two if you understand these two things that you can make a rational decision or you can make an intuitive decision and understand what the short falls of each other.

1242
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Because you can make two rational of a decision right you can analyze things to death or you can just look at the numbers or and you just make that kind of decision it can be wrong or you can make an intuitive decision which can also be wrong.

1243
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And it can be right so what are the shortness is that this is again.

1244
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Stuff that you cover in depth in this book.

1245
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Which is very a very interesting book and I believe will raise people's awareness and make them more capable of making decisions and by the way right now this is page 35 in the book.

1246
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
The book is actually called the stress effect how why smart leaders make dumb decisions and what to do about it.

1247
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
So all you've done up into this point is explaining.

1248
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
What types of leaders there are what types of decisions are being made.

1249
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So that way you can then explain what stresses.

1250
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And what stress does to your decision making process many of the things of which we've already talked about.

1251
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Yeah, stress just just always your decision making process as the stress level goes up.

1252
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Your cognitive ability goes down your emotional intelligence goes down the quality of your decision making goes down.

1253
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So managing stress is really key.

1254
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:54.000
If you're in a combat situation you're going to make a lot of intuitive decisions when I get all my feet and I look at I see there are two NVA standing there and they look at me and they turn their weapons.

1255
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I'm not going to say okay.

1256
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Let me see here now.

1257
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:08.000
What do I think the problem is let me heard those NVA what's going to happen and I don't work through that big problem solving process.

1258
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I see it.

1259
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I see the answer.

1260
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I pull the trigger.

1261
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
And I've got to do it.

1262
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I got to do it.

1263
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I got to do it.

1264
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
That's a good idea.

1265
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And but when I asked somebody and I do this all the time.

1266
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Somebody will talk about a decision like that and when I say how did you make that decision?

1267
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
They immediately launch into that problem solving model.

1268
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That's it.

1269
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
You did it in the last two seconds.

1270
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You didn't have time to do all of those things.

1271
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:44.000
What you're doing is you're using the solution that's setting on the top of what I call a dominant response hierarchy.

1272
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
You have trained and trained and trained to produce a certain response.

1273
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
When you see them, squeeze the trigger as you're going down.

1274
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
That's setting up there.

1275
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And that's what you're going to execute.

1276
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:04.000
If you want to execute a different plan, you're going to have to train in something else up there because it's going to come so fast.

1277
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And that's how you survive in a life and death situation.

1278
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
You've got to make a decision and you've got to do it very quickly.

1279
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
And if you have time, you've got to weaker so to make a decision.

1280
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
You can bring your team in.

1281
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You can work through that problem solving model and you know come up with a good decision.

1282
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
If you've got two seconds, you can't do that.

1283
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
You go to the intuitive because it's so much faster.

1284
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
But it's going to grab whatever is setting at the top.

1285
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
So you better be training for the right response.

1286
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And that's where the training comes in over and over and over in that sort ofmatic.

1287
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.000
When you, when you watch pro-affleets, they train all the time.

1288
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
And they train for particular responses.

1289
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And that's why they can do it so fast.

1290
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
If you like to play golf and you play golf was someone.

1291
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
If you want to give yourself an advantage.

1292
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And the guy you're playing with is a really good putter.

1293
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So you get on the green.

1294
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And you say,

1295
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Jaka, I've always been impressed with your ability to make those long puts.

1296
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I mean, we're friends.

1297
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Help me out here.

1298
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
To help me what you think about.

1299
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I mean, when you're getting ready to put,

1300
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
you're talking to me through the steps that you go through to make that put.

1301
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
He's going to blow it.

1302
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Because now he's thinking rather than executing.

1303
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
You know, pros execute.

1304
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's automatic.

1305
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
They don't have to think about it.

1306
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You make them think about it to blow it.

1307
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
When singers are singing a national anthem or something.

1308
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
If they make the mistake of thinking about what words come in next in the lyrics,

1309
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
they're going to blow it.

1310
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Yeah.

1311
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
You, it's got to be automatic.

1312
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I, well, we train a lot of GJitsu.

1313
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And, you know, I talk about GJitsu with the laws of combat and leadership and life and how it all is intertwined.

1314
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And guy said to me,

1315
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Hey, what, how does decentralized command fit into GJitsu?

1316
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I don't see where the, I see where prioritize next.

1317
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
He's, I see where simple is.

1318
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I see where covering movies.

1319
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I see where those are in GJitsu, but where's decentralized command?

1320
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And I said, here's exactly where it is.

1321
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000
You need to train enough that your body parts know to execute without being told what to do.

1322
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So when it comes time to defend your arm, you need to move that arm.

1323
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You don't have time to think about it.

1324
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Just like you don't have time to tell the platoon commander or the squad leader,

1325
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Hey, take and put down cover fire as we move to the flank mode.

1326
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
They've got to have the instinct to make that happen without you needing to tell them.

1327
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So that's where decentralized command comes in to your, to your GJitsu game.

1328
01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:03.000
You talk about this recognition primed decision model or RPD and just hitting a couple things here.

1329
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Here's what you do assess the situation.

1330
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Avaluated course of action, select an option, develop a solution set, generate an evaluate options,

1331
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
adjust the option, take action.

1332
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
And again, these are very similar ideas,

1333
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
but there's little nuances that you spell out,

1334
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
pretty, that you spell out inside the book.

1335
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Here's one, the technique of sufficing allows a solution to be chosen that is not perfect,

1336
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
but it's sufficient to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem.

1337
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:39.000
The RPD model chooses the first solution that might work a sufficing approach.

1338
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000
In most cases, trying to choose a solution using a maximizing,

1339
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
which is optimal or perfect approach tends to be unrealistic and inefficient,

1340
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
because the leaders making decisions in an environment where all the information about the problem

1341
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
and possible solutions are unknown.

1342
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000
So this is a great thing that I think I have always used.

1343
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Sufficing.

1344
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Yeah, that's the solution.

1345
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
It's going to be good enough.

1346
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
We need to go with it.

1347
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
You talk about cognitive intelligence.

1348
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And now this is a little bit different.

1349
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
cognitive intelligence.

1350
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:26.000
A very general mental capability that among other things involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,

1351
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:33.000
think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.

1352
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill or test-taking smarts.

1353
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings.

1354
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And then there's these terms catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.

1355
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:02.000
So this is a different type of intelligence, which obviously is very important.

1356
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
That definition is an excellent starting point for thinking about leadership and decision,

1357
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000
especially the last point about figuring out cognitive intelligence doesn't begin and end with having some smarts.

1358
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
An individual must know what to do with his or her cognitive intelligence.

1359
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And this is once again, you get these smart young officers that at a certain point in the field teams,

1360
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I mean, we're getting these incredibly qualified on paper individuals that were, you know, they should be this

1361
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
smartest people in the world, but you would see them have probably not all of them, of course,

1362
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
some of them were great.

1363
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Some of the guys went to Harvard, Yale, and everywhere else, and they were fantastic.

1364
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
But some of them, there wasn't all like that, wasn't across the board.

1365
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And that's exactly what you're talking about here.

1366
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
You got to be smart, but you got to know what to do with those smarts.

1367
01:45:50.000 --> 01:46:02.000
To some of the things that the cognitive intelligence, some of the abilities that includes

1368
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:11.000
fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, visual processing, auditory processing,

1369
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000
processing speed, short-term memory, long-term retrieval quantitative knowledge,

1370
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
correct decision speed.

1371
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Again, these are, as you think about these things.

1372
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
And if you're a humble person, you'll think to yourself, you know what?

1373
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
I need to learn the problem.

1374
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I need to, I don't process things very well. What should I do to counter that?

1375
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Maybe I should prepare more.

1376
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Maybe I should study more.

1377
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
My auditory processing.

1378
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Hey, how well do I actually listen?

1379
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
What can I do to improve my listening skills?

1380
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
If you don't admit that you don't listen well, you're not going to get any better at it.

1381
01:46:47.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I'm not going to get any better.

1382
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Conventive intelligence moderating factors.

1383
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
When all things aren't eaten, so here's some things that you talk about when it comes to cognitive intelligence.

1384
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
The factors that come into play.

1385
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
One of them is environment.

1386
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
You got a very interesting study.

1387
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:18.000
A group of kids that they gave better opportunities for two, you know, like low income kids.

1388
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000
They gave really good opportunities to some and didn't give them to the other ones.

1389
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
And actually didn't have that much of an effect which surprised me.

1390
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Like there was a little bump in the beginning, but then it just leveled out.

1391
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Most most of those studies are short-term studies.

1392
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So they create those environments.

1393
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
A few months later they get test and they say, wow, ten of them.

1394
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
This group really improved, but then they don't come back two years later, three years later.

1395
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.000
When you find those studies, they everybody's back to the same as they get older.

1396
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
But a time kids are 15.

1397
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Most of the stuff, this enriched environment, kind of work that you do with them when they're young.

1398
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Everybody's back to the same.

1399
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
They've all matured back to the same place.

1400
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
So you can't just look at what happens the first few months.

1401
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But nobody wants to do that.

1402
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
They want to play with their study and move on.

1403
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Hey, I got great results.

1404
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
They work.

1405
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
They want to sell you the Einstein music for your kids.

1406
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Yeah.

1407
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Maybe Einstein.

1408
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Yeah, whatever it's about.

1409
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Maybe Einstein.

1410
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Little Einstein.

1411
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Yeah.

1412
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000
We talk about age.

1413
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Here's some things.

1414
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
If you want to help preserve cognitive intelligence.

1415
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Cardiovascular.

1416
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
The absence.

1417
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Here's some things that that that specific factors that seem to help preserve cognitive intelligence.

1418
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's people age.

1419
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
The absence of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.

1420
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
A favorable environment above average education, occupational presuits.

1421
01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.000
It's involving high complexity and low routine above average income and the maintenance of intact families.

1422
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
A complex and intellectually stimulating environment.

1423
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000
A flexible personality style at midlife being married to a spouse with high cognitive intelligence.

1424
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Maintenance of high levels of perceptual processing speed.

1425
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Being satisfied with life's accomplishments.

1426
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Important.

1427
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And some of those things are hard for you to do.

1428
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I mean, they happen.

1429
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:36.000
The most important thing that you can do to maintain your cognitive ability, your intellectual ability,

1430
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
is a road we exercise.

1431
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Nothing has been proven long term to have a greater impact on your brain's operating, particularly.

1432
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Delay in the onset of dementia or Alzheimer's.

1433
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Nothing does better than a road we exercise.

1434
01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Or you're pumping the blood, you're pumping the food, and you're brain, you're cleaning your brain out.

1435
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
A road we exercise is all I'll do it for you.

1436
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Good information.

1437
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Talk about memory and then you talk about physical conditioning, which I'm a big supporter of.

1438
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Nutrition.

1439
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Obviously, if you're not eating clean, sleep, getting good sleep, there's one of my weaknesses.

1440
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I don't sleep very much.

1441
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Cognitive intelligence can be a double-edged sword.

1442
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
A leader with high cognitive intelligence can possess.

1443
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Can process information rapidly, solve complex problems quickly, and make effective decisions.

1444
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.000
He might also be perceived by his team as arrogant, condescending, and impatient.

1445
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:55.000
The leader knows he can do the work better and faster than his team members, and may forget sometimes that they don't have his ability.

1446
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
This is one of those where I'm worried about saying that one.

1447
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Because what this does is, it makes someone say, well, you know, people think I'm arrogant, because I'm so smart, because I have high cognitive ability.

1448
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
That's everyone else's problem.

1449
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:17.000
But as I've said to many smart people over the years, if you're so smart, why are you winning?

1450
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yeah, I mean, we see it all the time.

1451
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:29.000
That double-edged sword, you come across as a jerk, you come across as arrogant, and you're condescending toward people.

1452
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
It's always taking you so long.

1453
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I mean, this is simple.

1454
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Well, for you, it might be, but for the average person, it's not. And when you start putting that kind of feedback out, you're just taking too long.

1455
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I don't understand what's wrong with you.

1456
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000
You're just killing your motivation and causing them to see you more as a jerk.

1457
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That's going to hurt your leadership capital.

1458
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Talk a little bit about emotion here.

1459
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
All human decisions have some emotional component.

1460
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
That's the way the brain is wired as you're about to see.

1461
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:10.000
The more a leader understands the emotional component of decision making, the more effective her decisions can become.

1462
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Emotions happen.

1463
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Emotions are neural impulses that happen inside the brain and trigger a motivation to reach a goal.

1464
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Emotions are goal oriented. Whenever you try it, whenever you experience a motion, there is an end goal that the emotion is trying to move you toward.

1465
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Emotions have their beginning in the unconscious.

1466
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000
And most of them stay there. When an emotion becomes conscious, we have a feeling.

1467
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:44.000
For example, when the emotion of fear becomes conscious, I feel scared. Emotions can be viewed as providing situational reports about what is happening in the body.

1468
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Why am I shaking? I feel scared. Emotions have survival value.

1469
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000
David Caruso and Peter Salave researchers and educators provide the following linkages between emotions.

1470
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
And survival. Fear from a survival standpoint is let's get out of here.

1471
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Sadness is help me. Discussed is don't eat that.

1472
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Anger is about fighting. When you get angry, your anger raises your energy level to overcome an obstacle in your path.

1473
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
So there you go. You've got to recognize what's going on with these emotions.

1474
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Emotional intelligence has always been present and identified.

1475
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
But not valued as intelligence.

1476
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000
1995 Daniel Goldman brought emotional intelligence into the world's consciousness with the publication of his bestselling book emotional intelligence.

1477
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Why it can matter more than IQ. His books quickly spawned a perifflation of articles, books, workshops, training materials, assessments, and conferences on emotional intelligence.

1478
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
A cottage industry spring up almost overnight.

1479
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
The terminal emotional intelligence is used to describe a non-cognitive type of intelligence.

1480
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I define it as a person's innate ability to perceive and manage his own emotions in a manner that results in successful interactions with the environment.

1481
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And if others are present to also perceive and manage their emotions in a manner that results in successful interpersonal interactions.

1482
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Note that this definition does not require interaction with another person.

1483
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Emotional intelligence involves managing, controlling the awareness and appraising of emotions and the resulting motivation and action in a manner that produces successful outcomes,

1484
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000
whether in the presence or absence of others.

1485
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:45.000
It's a leader. I need to understand my emotions and how they impact me and what it causes me to do or how I can use it.

1486
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:52.000
I need to understand yours so that I want you to proof a document for me.

1487
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.000
If I make you really happy and then say proof this, you'll miss most of the time post.

1488
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.000
If I make you irritated, you'll find them all. You'll rip it apart. If they're something in there, you'll find it.

1489
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:12.000
So understanding the impact that the emotions are having on you and your performance and which way it drives you.

1490
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000
That's using emotional intelligence to be successful, to help you be successful.

1491
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000
You know, same on the battlefield. I need to understand the emotions that you're probably going to experience and what are they going to do to you?

1492
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000
How do you need to adapt them? How do you need to redirect them? Understanding that fear takes away your fine motor skills.

1493
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And I need to train you to be of the operate without those fine motor skills to be able to use the gross motor skills and still perform just as well.

1494
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
You just have to perform the task a little differently.

1495
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
So, she, without aiming, you learn the quick kill technique.

1496
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You talk about high jackers of emotional intelligence.

1497
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:08.000
When the high jacking occurs, it sets up an opportunity for your evil twin, the skipie to come forward.

1498
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Skipie is the bad side of you who says and does things that are uncharacteristic of you.

1499
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
It was not Mike Tyson who bit off the piece of it,

1500
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Evander Hall of Foods, Ir during a championship, fight in 1997. It was Tyson's evil twin, skipie.

1501
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000
So then you just go on to describe the fact that you've got to keep your emotions in check.

1502
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:39.000
And something we all need to look at for, especially Mike Tyson.

1503
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Stress interferes with the citizen making it.

1504
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And again, now, I've already talked about a bunch of stuff.

1505
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Getting into some of the book. More control equals less stress. I really like this part.

1506
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Data collected over the years on stress levels within the baboon population.

1507
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Reveal that a higher baboon is in the hierarchy, the less stress he experiences.

1508
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:09.000
These results suggest that the amount of control you have over your situation influences the amount of stress you experience.

1509
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Just to give in example.

1510
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
In the old days, with a sock team you got on a helicopter.

1511
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
You flew out to do your insertion.

1512
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
You found out what was going on at the LZ when you got there.

1513
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:33.000
And one day I asked the crew chief, you got an extra headset up here.

1514
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Can I wear that headset?

1515
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:41.000
And he said, you're, so when I put the headset on, all of a sudden I'm listening to Cubby.

1516
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Talk. I'm listening to our gunships talk. I'm listening about what's going on at LZ or they prepping it or they're seeing anything.

1517
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Did they receive an aircraft fire on the way out there?

1518
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
If the LZ is hot, I know it. I know what side is hot.

1519
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000
And I may have a plan that we're going to exit the aircraft and go east.

1520
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I really need to go west.

1521
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
All of a sudden I've got all this information that I can use to make decisions.

1522
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
And I could just literally feel most stress level coming down.

1523
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Okay. I understand what's going on now.

1524
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I don't have to figure it out in two seconds when I get there and I'm being shot at it.

1525
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Now I've got a plan.

1526
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000
So given myself control, I don't know why we didn't do that right from the beginning.

1527
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.000
But I know for me once I, once I could get access to that information,

1528
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
it just made all the difference in the world.

1529
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Yeah. There was a study and I'm trying to remember it all.

1530
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It was something about like, I think I don't know if these cats are people or what,

1531
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
but it was like they'd get a shock.

1532
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
No, this is the rats.

1533
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I've talked about this at the master.

1534
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Okay. Yeah.

1535
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Yeah.

1536
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Yeah.

1537
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Yeah.

1538
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Like so they'd shock them with a certain strength, right?

1539
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Of shock?

1540
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000
No. So this is the deal.

1541
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000
There's a cage.

1542
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Yeah.

1543
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Two sides to the cage.

1544
01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Each of the floors in the cage deliver a shock.

1545
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:09.000
One of them has a stronger shock, but there's a light that comes on before the shock goes off.

1546
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And so they're able to like expect it and understand it.

1547
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Yeah.

1548
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000
The other side less of a shock, but it's just completely random.

1549
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And there's a pathway to get between the two areas, but you can't like hang out there.

1550
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So the rats basically have to decide which side they want to be on.

1551
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
The stronger shock that they are prepared for or the random shock that's less.

1552
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000
And the rats always pick the side that has the warning.

1553
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
So they know what's going on.

1554
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Yeah.

1555
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah.

1556
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Even though it's worse.

1557
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Yeah.

1558
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I just talked about this.

1559
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I was talking to some army troops out in Hawaii, as a matter of fact.

1560
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And talking about, you know, you mentioned earlier that the thing that you can take away from troops that they care about,

1561
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000
money, more than money and rank is freedom.

1562
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Contrary to that or I guess the other side of that is the best thing you can reward someone with is more freedom in the form of.

1563
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And when you can do it at work, you can only give someone so much free time, but you say give them control over the exercise, give them control over the training, give them control over what time they get done, give them control over where they go.

1564
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And more control people have the more satisfied they are, the better they're going to perform.

1565
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And so that way you can use that, you can take control away from them and that's the worst punishment you can give them.

1566
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
The best reward you can give somebody is given freedom, give them control over their fate.

1567
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I think that's the most powerful driver I think that even drives people generally more than money.

1568
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
So I talk about that with companies that they, you know, weigh weak, we can't afford to pay anyone.

1569
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:55.000
To say we can't afford to pay our employees more than X or we'll go bankrupt or in the military, I can't go and you know, I can't pay my corporal's more doesn't work that way.

1570
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
What do you do? How do you reward them? You give them freedom.

1571
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
You give them control over their destiny. That will drive people.

1572
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000
And it's the best thing you can use.

1573
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:16.000
But that stress element, like it's almost even in GITZY have that if you compete in GITZY, if you don't know like when you're going to go on,

1574
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000
you know, because it's like, oh, I'm so it's going right now. But then they're not calling your name and you're like, you get all stressed.

1575
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
But then if you know, oh, it's your time then you're like less stress.

1576
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
It's almost like if you're in the dark about something, you're just more stressed.

1577
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So the more information you have about it, that's why people in the word, they're like asking all these questions like,

1578
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I wasn't going to go. They just want to know how it's going to go, you know?

1579
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
So yeah, that makes sense. I feel that.

1580
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Check out this dichotomy.

1581
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
A lot of people think dichotomy in my favorite word, but it is.

1582
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Check out this dichotomy as the number of choices increases the autonomy control and liberation.

1583
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
This variety brings us is powerful and positive.

1584
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000
But if the number of choices keeps growing negative effects start to appear as choices grow further,

1585
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000
the negative escalate until we become overloaded at this point.

1586
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Choice no longer liberates us. It might even be said to tear nice.

1587
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
So that's why discipline will give you freedom.

1588
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:19.000
And that's why giving someone, you know, if you have too many options, it can turn out to be a bad thing.

1589
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000
There's a definite dichotomy there.

1590
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Here's another, again, I'm jumping around a bit.

1591
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
A key point to remember is that all models, whether mental, physical, mathematical or

1592
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:39.000
mechanical, have blind spots when you choose a model you choose your blind spots.

1593
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.000
That's powerful. So whatever you're thinking, you're not necessarily, you're not going to be 100% right.

1594
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
There's going to be things that you don't see that you don't understand that you miss.

1595
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
What's critical is understand the models.

1596
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Understand the one that you choose.

1597
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000
And so what are the blind spots that I've just chosen?

1598
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Why am I not going to see by using this?

1599
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.000
And whenever you can, if you can use multiple lenses, and we do that a lot when we're assessing people,

1600
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I don't want just this one, this is an instrument because it's got all kinds of blind spots.

1601
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.000
So I pick another one that's going to close some of those blind spots because it covers those.

1602
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And, you know, so I get a better picture of what you look like by using multiple lenses to look at you with.

1603
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
So I don't, I don't have just one. I give you this one task.

1604
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I miss all this stuff over here.

1605
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:41.000
And by the way, if you don't have a high cognitive ability, when you see these two reports about someone that might have contrast to information,

1606
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000
you won't be able to, this report doesn't make any sense.

1607
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000
And you'll lean towards the one that makes the most sense to you that feels the vision that you've been looking for.

1608
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Here's the thing that I just had to read.

1609
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Catastrophic, when catastrophic leadership failures occur.

1610
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000
It is sudden and causes a catastrophic change in the leaders ability to perform successfully.

1611
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:09.000
The leader will exhibit some or all of a characteristic, characteristic set of behaviors.

1612
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
And here's those behaviors.

1613
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And this is to me, these are like red flags.

1614
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
These are things that if you're paying attention right now, and you're listening, you want to improve your leadership capabilities.

1615
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Pay attention to these things.

1616
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And when you notice yourself doing them, check yourself, detach, take a step back, and correct your trajectory.

1617
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Because your trajectory is not good.

1618
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Number one, not listening.

1619
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
That's number one, not listening.

1620
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Over analyzing failure to make decisions, low quality decisions, emotional decisions, flip flops, short-term decisions and focus.

1621
02:04:46.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Reactive decisions, defensiveness, rationalizing, self-satisfying, hedonism, denial, in-attentional blindness, fear-based decisions, anger-facilitated decisions, automatic decision-making and mental paralysis.

1622
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:13.000
So there's a list of things that you can identify about yourself when there's a stressful situation going on,

1623
02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:19.000
and you start making a rational decision, or you start making an emotional decision, or you're not listening to anybody else anymore.

1624
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Time to take a step back, detach, and get yourself, get your mind right, because it's not right to make decisions at that point.

1625
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
These are similar.

1626
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000
List of behaviors that will get you thinking about how you behave in stressful situations.

1627
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Aggression.

1628
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Laws of humor, taking offense isn't not a great one.

1629
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:51.000
We take offense, right, and that's a sign that says, oh, you're stressed out, and you're not about to make a good decision.

1630
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.000
In my opinion, when you're taking offense, that's rooted to something that we call ego.

1631
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000
It's going to be something that's brushing up against your ego.

1632
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Here's another one, wanting to be right.

1633
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Oh, that's also ego.

1634
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Wanting the last word, that's also ego.

1635
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Flooding with information to prove a point.

1636
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
That's ego.

1637
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Holding a grudge, that's ego.

1638
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I know that.

1639
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
That's ego.

1640
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
jealousy, that's ego.

1641
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Playing poor me, sarcasm, blaming, being too nice.

1642
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
That's an interesting one.

1643
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Being too nice, you're just going to, okay, yeah, I'll do it.

1644
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Oh, you just broke.

1645
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
So there's a dichotomy, right?

1646
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
One of them is one of us, we're getting aggressive.

1647
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
The other one is I'm just cowering down.

1648
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
There's a little dichotomy there.

1649
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
If you're doing well, you'll be balanced.

1650
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Here's echo's favorite.

1651
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
It's my, it's my personality.

1652
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
It's just the way I am.

1653
02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Don't lecture me.

1654
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
These are all just classic, just classic things that you do that should be signs that you're

1655
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
you're not doing well.

1656
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Chronic stress is a constant drain on the leaders overall capacity.

1657
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Accidentally leaving the car light on begins to drain the car battery.

1658
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Here you do a great job of, you know, talking about the comfort zone.

1659
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
And we don't want to be in the comfort zone all the time.

1660
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.000
We want to be pushing out of it a little bit that that forces us to to step up our game.

1661
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
But if we spend too much time up there out of the comfort zone,

1662
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000
we'll get burnout because we're having to be undergoing all the stress all the time.

1663
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
The other one I already talked about is rust out.

1664
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000
And that's when you're, you're just, you're doing something that's too easy.

1665
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
It's not challenging. You're, you're so deep in your comfort zone.

1666
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000
It's so easy for you that you don't care about anymore.

1667
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
The further the leader moves into the burnout zone, the faster you will burn out.

1668
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000
His performance job satisfaction interpersonal relationship, motivation and health will begin to deteriorate.

1669
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Dropping below the comfort zone takes the leader to into the rust out zone.

1670
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000
There are the leader will experience boredom, loss of motivation and lowered sense of purpose.

1671
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
So those important things to look for with your troops.

1672
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
You see someone that's bored, not motivated.

1673
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Cool. Put him in a leadership position. Let him step up.

1674
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Stress is not just a nuisance designed to frustrate humans and shorten their lives.

1675
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
And this is again, I'm jumping through this book.

1676
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Quite the opposite. The purpose of stress is to help people increase their odds of survival

1677
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:35.000
by providing quicker response time, more alertness and ability to focus more narrowly on the environment.

1678
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
The trick is to keep stress as an ally, not an enemy.

1679
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
So stress is not bad. It's not necessarily a battle time.

1680
02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It will make you better with, with some, as long as you get breaks from it.

1681
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Yeah. And you can adapt to stress.

1682
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:05.000
So it's like, you know, if you, if you live waste and you're going to do curls, you know, you get so echo approves of this.

1683
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah. So you can, you can get so you're using 35 pounds and you're doing 10 reps.

1684
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:19.000
And if you just keep doing 10 reps or 35 pounds every day, you don't get better.

1685
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000
What you have to do is stress yourself.

1686
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000
So you have to increase the weight.

1687
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
You can increase the reps.

1688
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Adapt to it. Then you increase again.

1689
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And what, what your body's doing is adapt into that stress.

1690
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000
A little at a time. So you keep it within a range that it can adapt to.

1691
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
And you'll keep getting stronger and stronger.

1692
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Same with running. You don't go out and run 26 miles the first day.

1693
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
You can kind of build up to it. And you're, you're stressing the body.

1694
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000
As you run longer distances or if you run hills or, you're running sprints.

1695
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000
You do a series of things that stretch you to help you get so you can go farther.

1696
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.000
And you can go faster. And eventually you can do the 26 miles.

1697
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.000
But if you just run three miles every day, if the same pace, you've got to max out right there.

1698
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And the 26 is just eat your lunch when you try.

1699
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:29.000
You know, this is, this is, when I was talking about me being, you know, having a positive attitude earlier, being an optimist.

1700
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
And I was thinking about this quote because I knew I was going to get to it.

1701
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000
When Collins asked Stockdale, this is Admiral Stockdale who's a POW.

1702
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000
When Collins asked Stockdale, which POWs didn't make it out, stockdale responded, that's easy.

1703
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000
The optimists, the optimists were the prisoners who believed that believed and would say that

1704
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
the North Vietnamese were going to release the POWs by Christmas.

1705
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
When it didn't happen by Christmas, they would say it happened by Easter.

1706
02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Then Thanksgiving, eventually the optimists would die of a broken heart.

1707
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
The solution according to Stockdale is that you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end.

1708
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they may be.

1709
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
That's important right there.

1710
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Yeah.

1711
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:32.000
We say in the 1980s, I worked at the Center for Army Leadership at 411 North Kansas, a subject matter expert on leadership and stress on the battlefield.

1712
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Research indicated that people high in psychological hardiness differed from people with low psychological hardness in four primary ways.

1713
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.000
A stronger commitment to self and attitude of vigorousness toward the environment.

1714
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000
A sense of meaningfulness and an internal sense of control.

1715
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Continue research narrow these differences to three factors, commitment.

1716
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000
The ability to feel deeply involved in life's activities.

1717
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Control the belief that you can control or influence stressful events in your life and challenge the anticipation of change as an exciting challenge for further development.

1718
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Yeah. Those are key.

1719
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
That challenge thing.

1720
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Instead of looking at everything like, oh no, this is happening to me.

1721
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
And instead saying, oh, this is an opportunity for us.

1722
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I had some client ask me the other day, well, what would you do?

1723
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.000
If your team got assigned the hardest job and how you can break the news to them?

1724
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000
You know what I said, oh, we got assigned the hardest job. I'm going to walk in there and be like, hey guys, guess what?

1725
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000
This company knows that there's only one team that can get this done.

1726
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
And they're saying it's going to take three months to get it done and guess what?

1727
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
We're going to get it done in two months.

1728
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
And it's going to take everything we've got, but we are going to crush this thing.

1729
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:06.000
And we're going to show not only where the only team that can do this, where the only team that can do absolutely anything.

1730
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And everyone's like, oh, yeah, because that's the attitude you got to have.

1731
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
This isn't a challenge that we're going to shy away from.

1732
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000
This is an opportunity for us to get after it.

1733
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Most people who study resilience agree on a core set of common factors.

1734
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Flexibility, adaptability, meaning value, determination, strength, and recovery.

1735
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
So talking about resilience. Those are some things to think about.

1736
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
That flexibility one isn't one that you might think of.

1737
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.000
It's a little counterintuitive to think, well, I'm resilient.

1738
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
So I just keep going the same direction.

1739
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
It's like, no, I actually am flexible and I'm going to adapt.

1740
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Got to adapt.

1741
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.000
As opposed to burning yourself out, beating your head against the wall.

1742
02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
You talk about this.

1743
02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:00.000
This acronym you use here, stress resilient emotional intelligence.

1744
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000
The ability to resist the negative influence of stress on the emotional aspects of decision-making,

1745
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000
by flexing and adapting to sudden change.

1746
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
As the stress level goes up, particularly toward the extreme level,

1747
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
people lose their access to emotional intelligence.

1748
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Oh, if you can't take a step back, take a breath,

1749
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
and get control your emotions you're going to have problems.

1750
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
There's no doubt about that.

1751
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
You have to learn how to breathe.

1752
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Breathing is a big deal.

1753
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Tactical breathing, or you inhale for four seconds, you pause,

1754
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
and you exhale for seconds.

1755
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Very quickly, that will help calm you down.

1756
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Sledge your heart, right back down.

1757
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000
We used it with sniper training.

1758
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
When you're reaching out those distances like they do today,

1759
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000
with a 50 caliber, you can retout and touch somebody two miles away.

1760
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000
But the pressure of the pulse and your finger is enough to change

1761
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
that your directory to cause you to miss it.

1762
02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
So it's low in your heart rate down.

1763
02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Causing it, be a little weaker, being very controlled,

1764
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
and squeezing it off.

1765
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
And you know, the Canadian guy that I don't remember whose name right now,

1766
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I think he has the record of a kill, like two point two miles.

1767
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
That's a crazy shot right there.

1768
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
That's a long way.

1769
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
But why used to do that?

1770
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Yeah, I always talk about the fact that it was always our goal

1771
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
to never sound excited on the radio.

1772
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
And in order to do that, you're going to have to control your breath

1773
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
when you get control your breath, and you control your voice

1774
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
that just calmed you down instead of a...

1775
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
I really need help over here.

1776
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Just hey, we need two more guys down this hallway, please.

1777
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
That's a great to stay calm.

1778
02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:00.000
You get in here to the seven best practices to prevent stress.

1779
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
And it said, a leader can get caught in ever accelerating

1780
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
downward spiral, and it starts with rising levels of stress.

1781
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
At first, the leader might think, I can power through this on tough.

1782
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
That's how I got to where I am.

1783
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
But as his stress levels begin to rise, he finds it more and more

1784
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000
difficult to maintain the lifestyle that helps keep the stress manageable.

1785
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
The diet quickly turns unhealthy.

1786
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
There's no time or energy for exercise.

1787
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
No time for sleep or rest.

1788
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
No time for family or friends.

1789
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
His attitude turns negative and learning holds.

1790
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000
A reinforcing loop emerges that sends the leader into a downward spiral

1791
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
like an airplane that has lost power in his out of the pilots control

1792
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
with little hope of recovery unless the leader can break the cycle

1793
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
and begin to climb again.

1794
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000
And this is your... something that you call arsenal,

1795
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000
and other acronym, the seven best practices, awareness,

1796
02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:03.000
rest, support, exercise, nutrition, attitude, and learning.

1797
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:11.000
And you go through each one of these and talk about how some steps

1798
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
to take for awareness, dedicate time,

1799
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
to stepping outside yourself, observing your actions.

1800
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000
And you go through the rest, you give great little sections of what to do to

1801
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000
rest, force yourself to take breaks, include personal time each day.

1802
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
You go through support.

1803
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
What does support mean?

1804
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Support is psychological, emotional, and physical people that help you

1805
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
in those categories.

1806
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000
So significant other family, friends, colleagues, coaches, mentors,

1807
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000
etc.

1808
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000
And what can you do?

1809
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Identify these people. And you get, again, you do that for each one of these for exercise.

1810
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000
You talk about what, you know, how you start an exercise program.

1811
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
And I think you use a couple.

1812
02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:02.000
You give one thing is, 60 days, go 60 days, do not miss an exercise session during the first 60 days,

1813
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
not even one.

1814
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
While some say new habits are created in 21 days,

1815
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I find that for most people 60 days tends to firmly transform any new behavior and do a habit.

1816
02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:18.000
So, and you obviously are a little bit of an exercise for that, because you still run an

1817
02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Iron Man?

1818
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Yes.

1819
02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
How'd you get into that?

1820
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Well, you know, it's always been physical.

1821
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:37.000
And about 10 years or so ago, I had my other son and law go do a triathlon.

1822
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And he got with Eric and I, and we got to do this.

1823
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000
This is a lot of fun.

1824
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
So, how old do you right now?

1825
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
72.

1826
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
So, at 62, you decided it was a good time to start triathlon.

1827
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Got it, okay?

1828
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Well, then, you know, got into that.

1829
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
And then, you know, triathlons are okay, but either, you know, Iron Man,

1830
02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.000
the distances are considerably, you know, fathers, so I got into that.

1831
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
And, you know, it was pretty cool.

1832
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I mean, it's a tough day.

1833
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Yeah, and especially at 62, there's one last time you did one.

1834
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000
A year ago?

1835
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Less than a year.

1836
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I mean, this year.

1837
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Okay.

1838
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
One this year.

1839
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
You know, may I start back again?

1840
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Are you like ranked in the world?

1841
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I wasn't till, I think, last year.

1842
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
You have to do a certain number of year.

1843
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000
And then, then you can total up points and they rank you.

1844
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.000
So, you know, I think my last ranking was

1845
02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000
fifth in the US, 15th in the world in my age.

1846
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
So, you definitely recommend exercise.

1847
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Yeah, apparently.

1848
02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I talk about nutrition, you know, eating the right stuff.

1849
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
This is all stuff that we know, but we don't want to do.

1850
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
You talk about attitude, engage in activities that build yourself confidence

1851
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
and self-esteem.

1852
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.000
You get to smile, see the glass is being half full.

1853
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Talk directly to the person you are unhappy with, not to your coworkers about that person.

1854
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Become a team player, ask fellow team members what you can do to help them.

1855
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
That's a good attitude to just men.

1856
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
And the last one you've got is lifelong learning.

1857
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
And again, I'm a reason for these things right now.

1858
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000
And that's why people need to buy the books so that they can get the men use themselves and read through.

1859
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Life long learning.

1860
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000
This is just such an important thing.

1861
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Set daily monthly quarterly and annually annual learning goals.

1862
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.000
For example, read two books monthly or improve a foreign language skill over the course of year.

1863
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Spend time with others who like to learn.

1864
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Spend time with someone you consider intelligent.

1865
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Get out of your comfort zone.

1866
02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Learn something you've always wanted to learn.

1867
02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Learn to learn the key putting off exercise all parts of your brain by choosing a variety of learning goals.

1868
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:12.000
So those are that's your that's your arsenal approach to controlling stress awareness,

1869
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.000
rest support exercise nutrition attitude and learning.

1870
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Here's the takeaway on arsenal.

1871
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
These are kniser cool.

1872
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000
An unaware brain is a surprised brain.

1873
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
A tired brain is a grumpy brain and unsupported brain is a sad brain.

1874
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
An unfit brain is a slow brain.

1875
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
A hungry brain is a distracted brain.

1876
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
A negative brain is an angry brain.

1877
02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:44.000
An unused brain is a forgetful brain.

1878
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Anything on missing on arsenal.

1879
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Now, let's get I mean we have an actual assessment that you can take online.

1880
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000
It shows you where you are.

1881
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I mean we use it quite a bit with our clients.

1882
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Stress is always an issue out there.

1883
02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000
So if we can help them find a way to to bring the stress down.

1884
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000
They'll perform better, particularly as a leader.

1885
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
I'm going to wrap up with this book here.

1886
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Training leaders is similar to training parachutes.

1887
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000
You have to train them to jump before pushing them out the door.

1888
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000
And then you say this close and out this book.

1889
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:29.000
And preparing for the future, we should keep in mind the old native American analogy that describes the past, present, and future as a log burning in a fire.

1890
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.000
The part of the log that has burned into ash is yesterday.

1891
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
The part that is burning is today.

1892
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And the part that will burn soon is tomorrow.

1893
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
We are the fire.

1894
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.000
We can only live today and what we do today.

1895
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Determines whether our fire will still be burning tomorrow.

1896
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Well, that wraps up this book.

1897
02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
And again, I mean I've breezed through this thing.

1898
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:06.000
There were some points that I definitely wanted to talk about and let people know about the book is called the stress effect by Henry L Thompson.

1899
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:13.000
And it's available on Amazon.

1900
02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000
What else, you know, we've covered a ton.

1901
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:22.000
We've merged a bunch of podcasts here.

1902
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.000
What else do we need to know about what you've got going on?

1903
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.000
What about high performance systems, HPS, YS, dot com.

1904
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
That's your company.

1905
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And this is what you do.

1906
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Yeah.

1907
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000
That's what we do.

1908
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000
We work with leaders around the world.

1909
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
We do a lot of work helping them improve their performance.

1910
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
We look at their cognitive ability.

1911
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
We can measure that.

1912
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Then we can work with you to make sure you're getting the most out of it.

1913
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
We work with manufacturing and building those high performance work teams.

1914
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
So, well, I go when you were talking about giving people control.

1915
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:05.000
If you take a high performance work team and a manufacturing plan and say,

1916
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Okay, you guys can start making decisions.

1917
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:17.000
So, you can even decide that echo Charles gets tomorrow off because he's got something he has to do.

1918
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And Eric is going to come in and work his shift so he can go do it.

1919
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And you don't have to come to me.

1920
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
The supervisor to ask permission to do that.

1921
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000
You guys are already authorized to do all kinds of things like that.

1922
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
If it's going to make the team perform better, you guys do it.

1923
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
So, you run yourself.

1924
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
You take care of yourself.

1925
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And I'm available.

1926
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:44.000
If you need to ask me questions or maybe some resources you don't have, then let me know.

1927
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I'll go find your resources for you.

1928
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
So, we do a lot of work like that.

1929
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
We do a lot with stress management.

1930
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
We do a lot with decision making on distress.

1931
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000
So, nuclear operators that are making decisions about whether or not the plan is going to melt down.

1932
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Because sometimes the stress gets really high in the control room when they have an incident.

1933
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
So, I'm teaching them how to get control of the stress and not lock up.

1934
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Law enforcement.

1935
02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:27.000
For the most part, I mean, the law enforcement has a different approach to dealing with bad guys than the military does.

1936
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:33.000
I mean, a law enforcement swat team has a different approach when they go into a realm.

1937
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000
When they kick a door down and go in, it's not like how a special ops team seal team come through that door.

1938
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000
When you go through, you're going to take out everything in there.

1939
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000
When the police want team goes through, there's a bad guy in there they want.

1940
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000
And they're not going to take out everybody that's in the room necessarily.

1941
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000
So, they, it's a very different approach going in, but it's very stressful.

1942
02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
And there's things that they can do.

1943
02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000
And things they need to understand about what they can do when a stress level goes up.

1944
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000
They're going to do to their decisions.

1945
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So, we work with them on that.

1946
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000
We can train them firefighters, same thing, EMTs.

1947
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
So, we do a lot of work like that.

1948
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
We're also working with vats, vet organizations.

1949
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So, we have this thing going on.

1950
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Twenty-two push-ups.

1951
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Because we have 22 vats a day committing suicide.

1952
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
So, the 22 push-ups is a awareness thing.

1953
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
So, we get that all over social media of people doing push-ups.

1954
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000
You know, you had to something earlier about, you know, echo which also probably got a knockout

1955
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Twenty-two for us.

1956
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000
The video.

1957
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
So, we can post it not there tomorrow.

1958
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So, you know, we had the challenge goings.

1959
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000
And we have a group of people around the country that have some of our coins.

1960
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000
And if they run into a vet, they think, you know, maybe on the edge.

1961
02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And they give him a coin.

1962
02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
It says, welcome home.

1963
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Thank you for the service all that kind of stuff.

1964
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And they reach out to him.

1965
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Sometimes, all you have to do is smile at somebody.

1966
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:14.000
There's a person out there today that is all a mission in their life before the days are.

1967
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000
And very often, they set up a condition.

1968
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I'm going to ride the bus to this place where I'm going to terminate myself.

1969
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000
If nobody speaks to me, if nobody smiles at me,

1970
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.000
nobody recognizes my presence between now and the time I get to this place,

1971
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I'm going to take my life.

1972
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000
But if I get some kind of interaction from somebody, I want to do it.

1973
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
And they get on the bus.

1974
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000
They go, nobody acknowledges them.

1975
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And they commit suicide.

1976
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Just reaching out, just talking to someone.

1977
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Sometimes, can turn them around and all of a sudden they don't do it.

1978
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
You can take them off of that list of 22.

1979
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
So we do that.

1980
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Is there a website to go for that?

1981
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Is that like a non-profit or?

1982
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Yeah, there's a mission 22.

1983
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Okay.

1984
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Their website.

1985
02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.000
On our website, we put on our stress effect website.

1986
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
We put things you can do to recognize that's not just that.

1987
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
But firefighters, police, you know,

1988
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
some of those other groups that are doing it.

1989
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
But particularly the vets, particularly,

1990
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
it's not just the older vets, but sometimes it's easier to see and them.

1991
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
But if you watch, you can see people that are not acting quite right.

1992
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000
And they may have on there their hat.

1993
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Now, you can see they've been in Afghanistan, wherever they are.

1994
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And you need to talk to them.

1995
02:28:48.000 --> 02:29:01.000
You had one person on one of your podcast very recently who is a suicide survivor.

1996
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
The person attempted suicide and somebody, you know,

1997
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
just snatched her up and got her out.

1998
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.000
And she'd do an all kinds of things that she wouldn't have done.

1999
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
No doubt about it.

2000
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000
No, so everybody has a purpose.

2001
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
There's a reason that you survived as long as you have.

2002
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
And to go out and terminate yourself.

2003
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000
I mean, all of a sudden, all those things don't happen.

2004
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I mean, you might be the person that saves a lot of other lives

2005
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000
if you stick around.

2006
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000
And I don't think we as a nation do very well.

2007
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Taking care of the vets.

2008
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
Do end the transitions.

2009
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000
And I know a lot of the vets who do take their own lives

2010
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000
or, you know, they're not in the VA program.

2011
02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
They've just trying to do things on their own.

2012
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And, you know, they get night down with a spiral.

2013
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
But if we see one, we talk to them.

2014
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
And that's amazing.

2015
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Some of the stories I'm getting back from some of the people that's kind of

2016
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.000
a join me in this program, women who are out walking or running.

2017
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.000
And they'll see a guy with his veteran hat on or something.

2018
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
That clues them in.

2019
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
And they just talked to them.

2020
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.000
And the guys just turn around.

2021
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I mean, all of them don't.

2022
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.000
But, you know, as military people, I think, you know,

2023
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
we have an obligation.

2024
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
We have an accountability.

2025
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
You know, we'll take care of real people.

2026
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000
So, anyway, we do think a lot of things like that.

2027
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Well, that's, I mean, that's awesome.

2028
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
That you already served your country.

2029
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:47.000
You know, in so many other ways and continue to serve the vets.

2030
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.000
And I don't know, do you have any other final thoughts?

2031
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I really appreciate the opportunity to come, you know,

2032
02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000
talk about some of the things that went on in song and some of the

2033
02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000
leadership and other topics that we got on today.

2034
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I appreciate you giving me that opportunity.

2035
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
You guys have been great.

2036
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Great questions.

2037
02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
I've been a fine day.

2038
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I have a question.

2039
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
What does make either?

2040
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
You said that a few times.

2041
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Making use of snake eater.

2042
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Special forces.

2043
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000
It's like a term.

2044
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000
It's like a term for like a special forces guy.

2045
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000
They'll say to him, you'll say, like, oh, that guy's a snake eater.

2046
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000
You're kind of saying it in the context like it was bad almost.

2047
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Like, from who was saying it in your stories.

2048
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
The competition.

2049
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Oh, yes.

2050
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I'm a ranger and you're special forces.

2051
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

2052
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
So I better than you.

2053
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2054
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
So when I call you a snake eater, it's bad.

2055
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Yeah.

2056
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
You know, when I call myself one, it's good.

2057
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

2058
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Cool.

2059
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Right on.

2060
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Right on.

2061
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Thank you.

2062
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Okay.

2063
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Well, you know, thanks to Eric for getting you out here.

2064
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:03.000
And I'm telling you, yeah, this is just a total honor for me to be able to sit here.

2065
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000
And hear your stories and pick your brain.

2066
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.000
And so thank you for coming on and sharing everything with us.

2067
02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
And, you know, more important.

2068
02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.000
And I think it's pretty obvious.

2069
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Thank you for your service.

2070
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000
And thank you when I hear your stories.

2071
02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:29.000
And I think about the times that you thought you would not come back and you went anyway.

2072
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:36.000
And you did that for me and for my kids and for our country.

2073
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
And I just wanted to say thank you.

2074
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
And it's been an honor to talk to you.

2075
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000
And I can't wait to hear feedback from people.

2076
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:48.000
And I'm sure they'll have so many questions that I'll have to drag you out here again at some point.

2077
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I appreciate your service and thank you for that.

2078
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000
And all the things that you've done and you're doing for the vats.

2079
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I mean, people listen to the use of podcasts.

2080
02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Listen to what you guys say and it makes a difference.

2081
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:09.000
And you know, you just don't realize when you help most of the people that you help.

2082
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Because you don't know where they were when they listened to your podcast or listen to you talk.

2083
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
But you're impacting people all over.

2084
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000
And you know, I'm glad I could come in and just hang out with you guys.

2085
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:29.000
And watch how you do this because you really make an impact.

2086
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Well, appreciate it.

2087
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
The door is always open to this podcast room.

2088
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000
The microphone will be waiting for you anytime you want to come back.

2089
02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And I'm sure that the amount of people will hear what you've had to say.

2090
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
And see what you've been through and you're going to help infinitely more people.

2091
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And it's so appreciated again, not just for what you've done in the past.

2092
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000
But for what you're still doing now.

2093
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
So thank you.

2094
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Thank you.

2095
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Thank you, echo.

2096
02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:00.000
So once again, Dick Thompson has left the building.

2097
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000
And once again, I cannot even get my mind around.

2098
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:13.000
What he's done and what he has learned and what he is passing on in these lessons.

2099
02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Because really there's no better way to learn and there's no better teacher than

2100
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.000
learning from those who have gone before us.

2101
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Who have tested the limits of human capacity for performance and leadership and decision making.

2102
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
And here we are.

2103
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
We get to sit here.

2104
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:46.000
We have to actually sit here and absorb the knowledge of these great men.

2105
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Who paid dearly for this knowledge.

2106
02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:00.000
And as we know, many of their comrades paid with their very lives.

2107
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000
So let us never forget that.

2108
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:12.000
That for every lesson there was blood spilled for every story.

2109
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000
There is a man who did not return.

2110
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000
So value.

2111
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:31.000
These lessons, lessons that we can apply to our lives, to our family, to our businesses, to our communities.

2112
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Everything we do we can apply, what we're learning here, don't squander these lessons.

2113
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000
We can do the attention to them.

2114
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Be aware.

2115
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
We talk a lot about awareness.

2116
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Be aware of your own shortfalls.

2117
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And then apply these lessons.

2118
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
That's what you have to actually apply them.

2119
02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
You can't sit back and listen to them.

2120
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000
You're going to actually apply them.

2121
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
So echo.

2122
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
We are all looking to learn.

2123
02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:16.000
We are all looking to somehow make up for our own shortfalls.

2124
02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000
And apply things to our lives.

2125
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
That will make us better.

2126
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Do you know of anything?

2127
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Softball coming at you.

2128
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Do you know of anything?

2129
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
That broadly speaking can make our lives better.

2130
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Probably and narrowly.

2131
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
That would be.

2132
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Okay.

2133
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Now is it possible that you're just a person that's just into it and so you're biased.

2134
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Because you like to do it.

2135
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Now you think everyone could gain from it and benefit from it, even though that could be wrong.

2136
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Is that a possibility?

2137
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Yes.

2138
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
That's a possibility.

2139
02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Well, actually I was going to say that's actually not possible.

2140
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Yeah.

2141
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Well, I'm more saying yes to the bias part of it.

2142
02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Okay.

2143
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
You are biased.

2144
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000
But even if you're biased, then that doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong.

2145
02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
I would tell you this.

2146
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
You're biased.

2147
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000
You're biased in favor of your jutsu.

2148
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And that doesn't affect the outcome of someone starting to jutsu and really gaining a ton from it.

2149
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
In making their life better.

2150
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Yes.

2151
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Across the board.

2152
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000
It's kind of like, you know how.

2153
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Like the sun. If I say, hey, the sun is warm on my face today.

2154
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
And I really like that.

2155
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Okay.

2156
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
And I'm biased towards the sun.

2157
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Okay.

2158
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
What if someone doesn't like that?

2159
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000
It's still warm on their face.

2160
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Seems like.

2161
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Okay.

2162
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Let's say not only that they didn't know.

2163
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
No, no, Brad, that was a perfect analogy.

2164
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Yeah.

2165
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Actually, that was pretty bad.

2166
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
But nonetheless, short notice.

2167
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
That's sort of how it goes.

2168
02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Hey, what's actually.

2169
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Factually.

2170
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Actually, you just do will improve your life.

2171
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Yes.

2172
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Yeah.

2173
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000
I guess that is possible.

2174
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Yes.

2175
02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
And I don't mean do jutsu wrong.

2176
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I mean approach.

2177
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Yeah.

2178
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Jutsu wrong.

2179
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000
So like, okay.

2180
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
So you mentioned before how.

2181
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.000
How the person, like a person in the beginning.

2182
02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.000
You, your confidence go like can go backwards.

2183
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
One step because you're like, oh, like how many people know this.

2184
02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
And I didn't even realize it.

2185
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
So you're kind of apprehensive.

2186
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Just in general.

2187
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.000
That is yes.

2188
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000
If you approach it correctly, in my opinion, because if you approach it wrong,

2189
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000
you're kind of like, oh, I know a choke.

2190
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
No, I know arm lock.

2191
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Now I'm better than everybody.

2192
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000
You know, kind of thing.

2193
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
That's the reality of Jutsu.

2194
02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
You won't feel that way because you'll get before you choke.

2195
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000
You learn a choke, but then you get choke and our mocked and

2196
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
come here at 15 times in one day.

2197
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000
So you don't feel more confident out of the date.

2198
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
I didn't know.

2199
02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Yeah.

2200
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
But then he can't know.

2201
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
You know what?

2202
02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
A small part of me did did.

2203
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Only if I knew the other.

2204
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Yes.

2205
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
It told me was.

2206
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000
But on top of it, I would know, you know, I know who in my little,

2207
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
when you say in my circles, like I knew who didn't train and who did,

2208
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
just like we all do, you know.

2209
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
I mean, strangers, I'd always be like, man, like,

2210
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
you know what I'm going to watch out.

2211
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Yeah, just like, you know how like sometimes you're like,

2212
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
you don't know if like I has a weapon or something like that.

2213
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
That feeling, it's that feeling, you know,

2214
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
but a little bit worse because

2215
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
if a guy's a web being kind of runaway,

2216
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
what a guy's going to, kind of, get your corpse

2217
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
you want o'er, all the way around and form a command,

2218
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000
like you're sitting here and have to run away.

2219
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:23.000
No, look what?

2220
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Well, it's like, there is an exception,

2221
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:25.000
somebody.

2222
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.50
Is that sat in a car store like anything we got

2223
02:39:28.50 --> 02:39:29.50
or just said it.

2224
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:31.000
Yeah.

2225
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:32.80
It's not like you can't get away with it,

2226
02:39:32.80 --> 02:39:34.000
it gets your lifetimes.

2227
02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:34.50
Right?

2228
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:37.50
Right?

2229
02:39:37.50 --> 02:39:38.50
And the, I had thisись to pick up.

2230
02:39:38.50 --> 02:39:38.98
He's a bunch of people are put around and they're not

2231
02:39:38.98 --> 02:39:40.000
put in there.

2232
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000
So, Human Power was like a gun.

2233
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Really?

2234
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000
He's a bunch of people with respect or momentum.

2235
02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Have you lived in the rural room?

2236
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Like in the 1400's wife,

2237
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.84
it's as you have to get around the other person's legs.

2238
02:39:49.84 --> 02:39:51.44
Yeah. That's the whole, that's what you got to do.

2239
02:39:51.44 --> 02:39:53.96
You think, oh, how long is that going to take?

2240
02:39:53.96 --> 02:39:56.24
Four seconds, three seconds, maybe even two seconds,

2241
02:39:56.24 --> 02:39:57.40
whatever, I'll get around their legs.

2242
02:39:58.20 --> 02:40:00.72
And then you realize it can take years and years and years

2243
02:40:00.72 --> 02:40:02.84
of trying to get past one person's guard.

2244
02:40:02.84 --> 02:40:04.52
If not never, sometimes.

2245
02:40:04.52 --> 02:40:05.32
Yeah.

2246
02:40:05.32 --> 02:40:06.68
And that's a crazy thing.

2247
02:40:06.68 --> 02:40:07.32
Very crazy.

2248
02:40:07.32 --> 02:40:09.56
It was, I think it was you at the master,

2249
02:40:10.12 --> 02:40:12.08
where I was like, we're talking about that.

2250
02:40:12.08 --> 02:40:13.80
I forget if you were saying it or I was saying it,

2251
02:40:14.80 --> 02:40:15.60
I think you were saying it.

2252
02:40:15.60 --> 02:40:17.60
And I was like, maybe, I don't know,

2253
02:40:17.60 --> 02:40:18.44
nonetheless, I was like,

2254
02:40:18.44 --> 02:40:19.96
because technically getting past someone's guard

2255
02:40:19.96 --> 02:40:21.84
is just getting past your legs, just like what you said.

2256
02:40:21.84 --> 02:40:23.72
And you can use this whole room.

2257
02:40:23.72 --> 02:40:27.28
I don't care if you walk out the door and sneak back in the back door.

2258
02:40:27.28 --> 02:40:28.80
You still can't do it.

2259
02:40:28.80 --> 02:40:30.40
And like you can, like I was,

2260
02:40:30.40 --> 02:40:33.20
and I did a little demonstration where I'd be like,

2261
02:40:33.20 --> 02:40:35.52
okay, this is like, all I got to do is get past your legs.

2262
02:40:35.52 --> 02:40:37.68
Guard, no guard, I just got to get past your legs, right?

2263
02:40:37.68 --> 02:40:40.20
So I backed way up and I started like walking around,

2264
02:40:40.20 --> 02:40:41.40
like you do this like turn.

2265
02:40:41.40 --> 02:40:43.32
And it just, yeah, it's crazy.

2266
02:40:43.32 --> 02:40:47.000
I'll just, how impossible that can kind of seem, you know?

2267
02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.96
But that's the jujitsu, you know?

2268
02:40:48.96 --> 02:40:52.16
And that's one tiny little sliver of an aspect of it.

2269
02:40:52.16 --> 02:40:53.44
It's just passing the guard.

2270
02:40:53.44 --> 02:40:57.16
You know, yes, it goes deep.

2271
02:40:57.16 --> 02:41:00.56
No, nonetheless, but yes, if you approach it correctly,

2272
02:41:01.16 --> 02:41:02.84
I have no doubt in my mind.

2273
02:41:02.84 --> 02:41:06.52
I don't know under any circumstance where it would

2274
02:41:06.52 --> 02:41:10.000
be an improvement in your life, net, net.

2275
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.68
Yeah, cannot think of one.

2276
02:41:11.68 --> 02:41:14.44
So overall we're saying, do jujitsu.

2277
02:41:14.44 --> 02:41:15.28
Yes, sir.

2278
02:41:15.28 --> 02:41:17.76
And once we decide to do jujitsu, which we just decided,

2279
02:41:17.76 --> 02:41:19.28
now we need to get a G.

2280
02:41:19.28 --> 02:41:23.48
Yes, we get an origin G from originmain.com.

2281
02:41:23.48 --> 02:41:25.12
You get a lot of stuff from there, but yes,

2282
02:41:25.12 --> 02:41:27.92
you get your G from there many different options.

2283
02:41:29.12 --> 02:41:30.40
Speaking of G's.

2284
02:41:30.40 --> 02:41:33.72
I've been noticing people getting blue belt,

2285
02:41:34.36 --> 02:41:39.08
winning tournaments, saying, hey, I joined jujitsu

2286
02:41:39.08 --> 02:41:40.36
because of Joko.

2287
02:41:40.36 --> 02:41:41.80
Yeah, because of this.

2288
02:41:41.80 --> 02:41:42.76
Well, yeah.

2289
02:41:42.76 --> 02:41:46.96
So there's a camp this year.

2290
02:41:46.96 --> 02:41:49.60
There was people that were like, I'm a Joko Blue belt.

2291
02:41:49.60 --> 02:41:49.96
Right.

2292
02:41:49.96 --> 02:41:50.96
And I was like, what is that?

2293
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:52.84
And they say, I started training because the podcast

2294
02:41:52.84 --> 02:41:54.60
and I was like, oh, awesome.

2295
02:41:54.60 --> 02:41:58.44
And I've met, I think, two Joko Purple belts.

2296
02:41:58.44 --> 02:42:02.68
Oh, well, the podcast has only been out for four years.

2297
02:42:02.68 --> 02:42:04.04
Fourish, yeah.

2298
02:42:04.04 --> 02:42:05.60
Yeah, we're coming up on four years.

2299
02:42:05.60 --> 02:42:08.04
So I mean, someone out of the gate was like, OK, I'm getting it.

2300
02:42:08.04 --> 02:42:10.48
Because you got, you know, it takes about four years to get a purple belt.

2301
02:42:10.48 --> 02:42:12.28
If you're like training hard, right?

2302
02:42:12.28 --> 02:42:13.88
This is no slack.

2303
02:42:13.88 --> 02:42:15.84
Someone that just jumps in.

2304
02:42:15.84 --> 02:42:20.36
So I think I've met two like Joko Purple belts.

2305
02:42:21.64 --> 02:42:22.000
So legit.

2306
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.52
But yeah, that's super cool.

2307
02:42:23.52 --> 02:42:24.36
Yeah.

2308
02:42:24.36 --> 02:42:26.56
So so you're not alone.

2309
02:42:26.56 --> 02:42:29.72
Don't feel like you ever feel like I know

2310
02:42:29.72 --> 02:42:31.72
one's really actually doing that.

2311
02:42:31.72 --> 02:42:32.72
So I'm not doing it.

2312
02:42:32.72 --> 02:42:33.56
Yeah.

2313
02:42:33.56 --> 02:42:34.72
People are absolutely doing it.

2314
02:42:34.72 --> 02:42:35.40
Yeah, yes.

2315
02:42:35.40 --> 02:42:36.24
100%.

2316
02:42:36.24 --> 02:42:39.40
My wife just wasn't England.

2317
02:42:39.40 --> 02:42:40.68
She delivered a friend.

2318
02:42:40.68 --> 02:42:45.68
She delivered an origingie to England for her friends,

2319
02:42:49.64 --> 02:42:52.32
husband, Anthony.

2320
02:42:52.32 --> 02:42:55.80
He's, he's, you know, he's like, whatever.

2321
02:42:55.80 --> 02:43:00.12
50, he's like my age 40, 852, something like that.

2322
02:43:00.12 --> 02:43:01.56
Obsessed with the Jiu Jitsu.

2323
02:43:01.56 --> 02:43:03.60
He's been training for six months.

2324
02:43:03.60 --> 02:43:04.96
Jack, a white belt.

2325
02:43:04.96 --> 02:43:06.48
He's like in the game, right?

2326
02:43:06.48 --> 02:43:07.32
Yeah.

2327
02:43:07.32 --> 02:43:08.64
At some point, you commit.

2328
02:43:08.64 --> 02:43:09.96
You say you know what I'm going to do this.

2329
02:43:09.96 --> 02:43:10.80
Yeah.

2330
02:43:10.80 --> 02:43:11.80
Just do it.

2331
02:43:11.80 --> 02:43:12.80
Yeah.

2332
02:43:12.80 --> 02:43:13.80
Just do it.

2333
02:43:13.80 --> 02:43:15.64
This is how you know you and we haven't used the expression.

2334
02:43:15.64 --> 02:43:16.96
You just to bug recently.

2335
02:43:16.96 --> 02:43:21.96
But this is how you kind of know when you're sort of trying to figure out moves

2336
02:43:21.96 --> 02:43:25.48
when you're like, embed or driving or this kind of stuff.

2337
02:43:25.48 --> 02:43:27.44
What is like constantly rolling in your mind?

2338
02:43:27.44 --> 02:43:28.72
It might be this a good feeling.

2339
02:43:28.72 --> 02:43:29.72
Yeah.

2340
02:43:29.72 --> 02:43:31.96
Because it does translate when you go back in, like you work it out.

2341
02:43:31.96 --> 02:43:33.76
It's good, man.

2342
02:43:33.76 --> 02:43:36.88
But yes, people are in the game.

2343
02:43:36.88 --> 02:43:39.56
So yeah, and you're going to train G.

2344
02:43:39.56 --> 02:43:42.28
So get a Jiu Jitsu G from origin main.com.

2345
02:43:42.28 --> 02:43:46.52
Get a rash guard so you can train no G, which is also important.

2346
02:43:46.52 --> 02:43:47.52
Very important.

2347
02:43:47.52 --> 02:43:51.44
As Echo would say, I would just say important.

2348
02:43:51.44 --> 02:43:52.44
But you would say important.

2349
02:43:52.44 --> 02:43:54.000
I don't hear the difference.

2350
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Yeah.

2351
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
I don't hear anything.

2352
02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.68
And then the problem is, the problem is you're going to want to represent.

2353
02:44:03.68 --> 02:44:04.68
Off the mats.

2354
02:44:04.68 --> 02:44:05.68
Off the mats.

2355
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:06.68
Right?

2356
02:44:06.68 --> 02:44:09.68
And we can go into the whole thing about how you can't wear a G to the club.

2357
02:44:09.68 --> 02:44:10.68
Right?

2358
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:11.68
Yes.

2359
02:44:11.68 --> 02:44:13.68
You can't wear a G to the grocery store.

2360
02:44:13.68 --> 02:44:14.68
Jiu Jitsu G.

2361
02:44:14.68 --> 02:44:15.68
Now you can get away with G pants.

2362
02:44:15.68 --> 02:44:16.68
Let's face it.

2363
02:44:16.68 --> 02:44:17.68
Let's face it.

2364
02:44:17.68 --> 02:44:21.68
I think most of us have been into a grocery store in G pants.

2365
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:22.68
I know I have.

2366
02:44:22.68 --> 02:44:23.68
Especially the black ones.

2367
02:44:23.68 --> 02:44:24.68
The orange and black ones.

2368
02:44:24.68 --> 02:44:25.68
They could look kind of dope.

2369
02:44:25.68 --> 02:44:27.68
You could probably go to a club in the origin black.

2370
02:44:27.68 --> 02:44:28.68
You could put it off.

2371
02:44:28.68 --> 02:44:29.68
You could pull it off.

2372
02:44:29.68 --> 02:44:30.68
What kind of level?

2373
02:44:30.68 --> 02:44:31.68
What kind of fashion?

2374
02:44:31.68 --> 02:44:32.68
You know you're a fashion guy.

2375
02:44:32.68 --> 02:44:34.68
Where does that fit into the fashion world?

2376
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:41.68
Like what would you wear with black G pants to a club to a, let's say a bar.

2377
02:44:41.68 --> 02:44:42.68
You're going to a bar.

2378
02:44:42.68 --> 02:44:45.68
You put on the G pants and you just what are you using wearing a t-shirt.

2379
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:46.68
There's an orange and t-shirt.

2380
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:49.68
Well, that's not a death court t-shirt.

2381
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:51.68
Let's clarify.

2382
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:53.68
First off, I'm not a fashion person.

2383
02:44:53.68 --> 02:44:57.68
But if I was, I would say there is no fashionable.

2384
02:44:57.68 --> 02:45:01.68
Unless you're going to extreme new age fashion, which I can think.

2385
02:45:01.68 --> 02:45:03.68
Then yeah, you could wear it.

2386
02:45:03.68 --> 02:45:04.68
You know, it's funny.

2387
02:45:04.68 --> 02:45:08.68
You ever heard of this store called Patagonia.

2388
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:11.68
It made out of a wearer and stuff.

2389
02:45:11.68 --> 02:45:12.68
Oh, yeah.

2390
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:13.68
Outdoor clothing, right?

2391
02:45:13.68 --> 02:45:15.68
Well, Patagonia used to have pants.

2392
02:45:15.68 --> 02:45:16.68
They maybe they still do.

2393
02:45:16.68 --> 02:45:19.68
That were called G pants.

2394
02:45:19.68 --> 02:45:20.68
That's what they were called.

2395
02:45:20.68 --> 02:45:21.68
They probably still have.

2396
02:45:21.68 --> 02:45:26.68
So maybe, you know, they're over there wearing their G pants out.

2397
02:45:26.68 --> 02:45:30.68
Maybe we just get the game and represent even harder.

2398
02:45:30.68 --> 02:45:31.68
But are they called?

2399
02:45:31.68 --> 02:45:32.68
Yes, they're called G pants.

2400
02:45:32.68 --> 02:45:33.68
Or they called G-Pants.

2401
02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:34.68
Or they called G-I-Pants.

2402
02:45:34.68 --> 02:45:36.68
They're called G-Pants.

2403
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:41.68
They're, they're, when you, I remember back in the day I would read the little description.

2404
02:45:41.68 --> 02:45:47.68
And it would say, you know, the G-Pants is based on the loose fitting martial arts.

2405
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:48.68
Oh, yeah.

2406
02:45:48.68 --> 02:45:50.68
Yeah, and I say that in a little description.

2407
02:45:50.68 --> 02:45:51.68
Yeah, that's okay.

2408
02:45:51.68 --> 02:45:52.68
So yeah.

2409
02:45:52.68 --> 02:45:53.68
All right.

2410
02:45:53.68 --> 02:45:54.68
Well, yeah.

2411
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:55.68
I mean, then it's kind of like whatever you day.

2412
02:45:55.68 --> 02:45:57.68
I mean, it wouldn't be a violation overall.

2413
02:45:57.68 --> 02:45:59.68
Especially if there were the black ones.

2414
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:03.68
So if you were the white, maybe the kind of where people will look like if you were.

2415
02:46:03.68 --> 02:46:05.68
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, you couldn't wear white.

2416
02:46:05.68 --> 02:46:06.68
No.

2417
02:46:06.68 --> 02:46:07.68
He pants out for just no reason.

2418
02:46:07.68 --> 02:46:09.68
But the black, you could kind of be a hard one.

2419
02:46:09.68 --> 02:46:10.68
Pull off, yes, sir.

2420
02:46:10.68 --> 02:46:11.68
Yeah.

2421
02:46:11.68 --> 02:46:12.68
So anyways.

2422
02:46:12.68 --> 02:46:16.68
But if you don't want to wear your G-Pants, and you still want to represent, that's fine.

2423
02:46:16.68 --> 02:46:20.68
You can get a pair of origin jeans, which are also made in America.

2424
02:46:20.68 --> 02:46:24.68
The little brass rivets are made in America.

2425
02:46:24.68 --> 02:46:25.68
The zipper is made in America.

2426
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:27.68
The thread is made in America.

2427
02:46:27.68 --> 02:46:34.68
And they're sewn by craftsmen, crafts women up in Maine.

2428
02:46:34.68 --> 02:46:37.68
That's what they're made.

2429
02:46:37.68 --> 02:46:38.68
So everything is there.

2430
02:46:38.68 --> 02:46:42.68
There's that there as American as American can be.

2431
02:46:42.68 --> 02:46:44.68
That's what those jeans are.

2432
02:46:44.68 --> 02:46:50.68
When you put them on, you are embracing America through its core.

2433
02:46:50.68 --> 02:46:52.68
And you're rebuilding America.

2434
02:46:52.68 --> 02:46:55.68
Because you got to remember all those, none of those people had jobs.

2435
02:46:55.68 --> 02:47:01.68
None of those people at origin had jobs five years ago, three years ago, two years ago.

2436
02:47:01.68 --> 02:47:04.68
Because all the jobs had been taken overseas.

2437
02:47:04.68 --> 02:47:06.68
We're bringing them back.

2438
02:47:06.68 --> 02:47:15.68
So embrace America and embrace origin jeans.

2439
02:47:15.68 --> 02:47:16.68
Two kinds.

2440
02:47:16.68 --> 02:47:19.68
There's the heavy, there's the factory jeans.

2441
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:23.68
What we call those are the OG, the original ones.

2442
02:47:23.68 --> 02:47:28.68
And then there's the Delta 68, which are mine.

2443
02:47:28.68 --> 02:47:31.68
And I signature jeans.

2444
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:33.68
But they don't say Jocquawanum.

2445
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:36.68
Because that's not, no, they say Delta 68,

2446
02:47:36.68 --> 02:47:39.68
named after my four fathers in the SEAL teams in Vietnam.

2447
02:47:39.68 --> 02:47:45.68
That wore jeans into the May Kong Delta to hunt down the enemy.

2448
02:47:45.68 --> 02:47:48.68
And they did it because they were more durable.

2449
02:47:48.68 --> 02:47:49.68
They lasted longer.

2450
02:47:49.68 --> 02:47:50.68
They were quiet.

2451
02:47:50.68 --> 02:47:51.68
So that's what we did.

2452
02:47:51.68 --> 02:47:53.68
We brought them back.

2453
02:47:53.68 --> 02:47:54.68
Delta 68.

2454
02:47:54.68 --> 02:47:55.68
Represent.

2455
02:47:55.68 --> 02:47:56.68
Yep.

2456
02:47:56.68 --> 02:47:57.68
Good on you.

2457
02:47:57.68 --> 02:47:58.68
Get some.

2458
02:47:58.68 --> 02:47:59.68
What else?

2459
02:47:59.68 --> 02:48:00.68
Well.

2460
02:48:00.68 --> 02:48:02.68
From origin, well.

2461
02:48:02.68 --> 02:48:06.68
Supplements, of course, keeping us in the game.

2462
02:48:06.68 --> 02:48:11.68
So, you know, 50 years old, your friends, your wife's friends, husband.

2463
02:48:11.68 --> 02:48:12.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2464
02:48:12.68 --> 02:48:13.68
What was the name again?

2465
02:48:13.68 --> 02:48:14.68
Anthony.

2466
02:48:14.68 --> 02:48:15.68
Anthony.

2467
02:48:15.68 --> 02:48:16.68
50.

2468
02:48:16.68 --> 02:48:17.68
We'll just say 50.

2469
02:48:17.68 --> 02:48:18.68
Around 50.

2470
02:48:18.68 --> 02:48:19.68
So, cause people will ask,

2471
02:48:19.68 --> 02:48:21.68
Like, am I too old to start you?

2472
02:48:21.68 --> 02:48:22.68
No, you're 40.

2473
02:48:22.68 --> 02:48:23.68
You're not.

2474
02:48:23.68 --> 02:48:24.68
Yeah, negative.

2475
02:48:24.68 --> 02:48:28.68
I know guy 41 and started and it's kind of a,

2476
02:48:28.68 --> 02:48:30.68
a little bit of a handful.

2477
02:48:30.68 --> 02:48:34.68
They do it 41, which, you know, that's not terribly old.

2478
02:48:34.68 --> 02:48:35.68
But it's not terribly old.

2479
02:48:35.68 --> 02:48:37.68
Well, no, actually what surprised me, it's just a handful to deal with.

2480
02:48:37.68 --> 02:48:39.68
That means, because there are some people that,

2481
02:48:39.68 --> 02:48:41.68
whether they're 20 or whether they're 40,

2482
02:48:41.68 --> 02:48:43.68
they just have a little something.

2483
02:48:43.68 --> 02:48:44.68
Yeah.

2484
02:48:44.68 --> 02:48:45.68
They have a little, they have a little,

2485
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:48.68
some skills, some inherent good instincts.

2486
02:48:48.68 --> 02:48:50.68
There's some inherent strengths.

2487
02:48:50.68 --> 02:48:52.68
Flexibility.

2488
02:48:52.68 --> 02:48:53.68
I got something.

2489
02:48:53.68 --> 02:48:55.68
Yes, it's.

2490
02:48:55.68 --> 02:48:56.68
It's.

2491
02:48:56.68 --> 02:48:58.68
The blend is where everybody in it.

2492
02:48:58.68 --> 02:48:59.68
You can even train hard.

2493
02:48:59.68 --> 02:49:02.68
But if you do, you do have to mine these things.

2494
02:49:02.68 --> 02:49:05.68
Like, okay, I'm not 20 years old anymore.

2495
02:49:05.68 --> 02:49:07.68
I'm 50 years old now.

2496
02:49:07.68 --> 02:49:09.68
So, you got to, you do have to mine those things.

2497
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:09.68
Yeah.

2498
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:10.68
Not nothing.

2499
02:49:10.68 --> 02:49:10.68
Yeah.

2500
02:49:10.68 --> 02:49:15.68
So, if you're going death matches eight rounds, six minutes.

2501
02:49:15.68 --> 02:49:17.68
Okay, that's again, that's not nothing there either.

2502
02:49:17.68 --> 02:49:19.68
So, but here, good news.

2503
02:49:19.68 --> 02:49:21.68
Join Warfare, Crill Oil.

2504
02:49:21.68 --> 02:49:24.68
These things will keep you deep in the game.

2505
02:49:24.68 --> 02:49:25.68
Take for me.

2506
02:49:25.68 --> 02:49:27.68
I can turn up the workout.

2507
02:49:27.68 --> 02:49:29.68
Personal, I'm speaking for myself.

2508
02:49:29.68 --> 02:49:31.68
I'm no anomaly.

2509
02:49:31.68 --> 02:49:33.68
I can go deep.

2510
02:49:33.68 --> 02:49:35.68
Hardcore on a workout week after week.

2511
02:49:35.68 --> 02:49:35.68
After week.

2512
02:49:35.68 --> 02:49:37.68
Differentes is if I do take joint warfare,

2513
02:49:37.68 --> 02:49:40.68
cruel oil and if I don't take joint warfare, cruel oil,

2514
02:49:40.68 --> 02:49:41.68
I won't be able to go.

2515
02:49:41.68 --> 02:49:42.68
If I don't.

2516
02:49:42.68 --> 02:49:44.68
If I do, I can't.

2517
02:49:44.68 --> 02:49:46.68
This applies to everybody.

2518
02:49:46.68 --> 02:49:47.68
Like I said.

2519
02:49:47.68 --> 02:49:49.68
So, that question is sir.

2520
02:49:49.68 --> 02:49:50.68
Answer.

2521
02:49:50.68 --> 02:49:51.68
Yes.

2522
02:49:51.68 --> 02:49:56.68

Once a month, you get your bottle.

There you go.

2528
02:50:05.68 --> 02:50:06.68
You start to get your krill oil.

2529
02:50:06.68 --> 02:50:07.68
You get it.

2530
02:50:07.68 --> 02:50:08.68

02:50:08.68 --> 02:50:12.68
So, check out the subscriptions there on,

2532
02:50:12.68 --> 02:50:14.68

2533
02:50:14.68 --> 02:50:18.68
And don't forget about moke, which is additional protein.

2534
02:50:18.68 --> 02:50:19.68
Which you also need.

2535
02:50:19.68 --> 02:50:21.68
If you're, if you're lifting,

2536
02:50:21.68 --> 02:50:23.68
if you're training, if you're running,

2537
02:50:23.68 --> 02:50:25.68
if you're alive.

2538
02:50:25.68 --> 02:50:28.68
And on top of that, if you get done with a really good dinner,

2539
02:50:28.68 --> 02:50:31.68
even if you got some delicious like steak.

2540
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:33.68
And then you got done.

2541
02:50:33.68 --> 02:50:36.68
And you still have this little thing in the back.

2542
02:50:36.68 --> 02:50:38.68
You're head that you just need a little.

2543
02:50:38.68 --> 02:50:41.68
A little bit of sweetness, a little bit of that.

2544
02:50:41.68 --> 02:50:43.68
You can just mix it in the ones who better.

2545
02:50:43.68 --> 02:50:46.68
Just mix yourself a one scoop moke.

2546
02:50:46.68 --> 02:50:50.68
And you'll go to bed completely satisfied.

2547
02:50:50.68 --> 02:50:57.68
You feel like, look, I'm completely satisfied with what I've eaten.

2548
02:50:57.68 --> 02:50:58.68
Yes.

2549
02:50:58.68 --> 02:50:59.68
And you're stronger.

2550
02:50:59.68 --> 02:51:00.68
And healthier.

2551
02:51:00.68 --> 02:51:02.68
On your way to recover.

2552
02:51:02.68 --> 02:51:03.68
Yes, too.

2553
02:51:03.68 --> 02:51:05.68
You will not relate to this,

2554
02:51:05.68 --> 02:51:07.68
but people may be able to.

2555
02:51:07.68 --> 02:51:08.68
Okay.

2556
02:51:08.68 --> 02:51:11.68
So, when you get on the path from,

2557
02:51:11.68 --> 02:51:17.68
not being on the path, your initial get on might include quitting drinking,

2558
02:51:17.68 --> 02:51:20.68
cutting down drinking, but probably quitting drinking.

2559
02:51:20.68 --> 02:51:21.68
Okay.

2560
02:51:21.68 --> 02:51:25.68
So, here's a common thing that I heard and experience with quitting drinking,

2561
02:51:25.68 --> 02:51:29.68
where you kind of crave like sweets or like desserts.

2562
02:51:29.68 --> 02:51:31.68
And just something that'll like give you a, like,

2563
02:51:31.68 --> 02:51:34.68
a what a dopamine or whatever the chemical hit.

2564
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:35.68
Yeah.

2565
02:51:35.68 --> 02:51:36.68
Yeah.

2566
02:51:36.68 --> 02:51:37.68
So, you'll want that.

2567
02:51:37.68 --> 02:51:39.68
Like you want like cookies or stuff.

2568
02:51:39.68 --> 02:51:41.68
Because you're not drinking anymore or whatever.

2569
02:51:41.68 --> 02:51:42.68
That'll be like a result.

2570
02:51:42.68 --> 02:51:43.68
Yep.

2571
02:51:43.68 --> 02:51:45.68
This is what I heard and literally experienced.

2572
02:51:45.68 --> 02:51:48.68
And it's, it was like stronger than I expected to.

2573
02:51:48.68 --> 02:51:51.68
Now, if you have the moke.

2574
02:51:51.68 --> 02:51:53.68
Boom problem solved.

2575
02:51:53.68 --> 02:51:55.68
100% because it does supply that, you know,

2576
02:51:55.68 --> 02:51:58.68
the dessert kind of scenario, but she put some peanut butter.

2577
02:51:58.68 --> 02:52:01.68
But, you know, but there, there, no fact.

2578
02:52:01.68 --> 02:52:03.68
There, you're on the path.

2579
02:52:03.68 --> 02:52:06.68
100% no side effects, no drawbacks.

2580
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:07.68
Yeah.

2581
02:52:07.68 --> 02:52:09.68
You know, no side effects, no drawbacks.

2582
02:52:09.68 --> 02:52:11.68
If you get the RTD, the ready to drink,

2583
02:52:11.68 --> 02:52:13.68
discipline go in a can.

2584
02:52:13.68 --> 02:52:14.68
RTD.

2585
02:52:14.68 --> 02:52:15.68
Did you speak to them?

2586
02:52:15.68 --> 02:52:16.68
No, no, that's a thing.

2587
02:52:16.68 --> 02:52:17.68
That's a product made.

2588
02:52:17.68 --> 02:52:19.68
It's like, oh, this is an RTD.

2589
02:52:19.68 --> 02:52:20.68
Sounds like you made it up.

2590
02:52:20.68 --> 02:52:21.68
I didn't make it up.

2591
02:52:21.68 --> 02:52:23.68
It's good sounds like you made it up.

2592
02:52:23.68 --> 02:52:24.68
Okay.

2593
02:52:24.68 --> 02:52:26.68
It says it right there on the page.

2594
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:26.68
Oh, yeah.

2595
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:27.68
High speed low drag RTD.

2596
02:52:27.68 --> 02:52:28.68
Yeah.

2597
02:52:28.68 --> 02:52:29.68
Make it up in RTD.

2598
02:52:29.68 --> 02:52:30.68
No.

2599
02:52:30.68 --> 02:52:33.68
But speaking of that, when, when I was, when I went up to a

2600
02:52:33.68 --> 02:52:36.68
field, on spot cast, and he was drinking it, and he started

2601
02:52:36.68 --> 02:52:38.68
getting that, you know, you start feeling it.

2602
02:52:38.68 --> 02:52:39.68
He's feeling it.

2603
02:52:39.68 --> 02:52:42.68
And he was pretty funny.

2604
02:52:42.68 --> 02:52:45.68
And he says he said something along the lines of, you know,

2605
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:47.68
I might find myself back on cocaine.

2606
02:52:47.68 --> 02:52:48.68
Yeah.

2607
02:52:48.68 --> 02:52:49.68
That's true.

2608
02:52:49.68 --> 02:52:51.68
So he, he started feeling like the,

2609
02:52:51.68 --> 02:52:53.68
and I said, no, you don't need to go back on cocaine, you know,

2610
02:52:53.68 --> 02:52:55.68
thinking of myself, you know, you can cocaine.

2611
02:52:55.68 --> 02:52:58.68
Just need a little bit more discipline go RTD, yeah.

2612
02:52:58.68 --> 02:53:01.68
Which is not, and it won't make you.

2613
02:53:01.68 --> 02:53:03.68
It won't make you.

2614
02:53:03.68 --> 02:53:05.68
It's not a gateway drug.

2615
02:53:05.68 --> 02:53:06.68
It's not a gateway drug.

2616
02:53:06.68 --> 02:53:09.68
It's not going to make you end up sleeping on a park fence.

2617
02:53:09.68 --> 02:53:10.68
The opposite.

2618
02:53:10.68 --> 02:53:12.68
You might buy the park.

2619
02:53:12.68 --> 02:53:14.68
It's probably going to happen.

2620
02:53:14.68 --> 02:53:15.68
So, too.

2621
02:53:15.68 --> 02:53:18.68
Also, jokow IT, speaking of picking up park benches and whatnot.

2622
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:19.68
Yeah.

2623
02:53:19.68 --> 02:53:20.68
Talk about T boom.

2624
02:53:20.68 --> 02:53:21.68
And it happens to taste good.

2625
02:53:21.68 --> 02:53:24.68
And it happens to be certified organic.

2626
02:53:24.68 --> 02:53:25.68
You like mentioning that.

2627
02:53:25.68 --> 02:53:26.68
I, yeah, man.

2628
02:53:26.68 --> 02:53:27.68
I do.

2629
02:53:27.68 --> 02:53:29.68
There's a big deal to get that little

2630
02:53:29.68 --> 02:53:31.68
qualification.

2631
02:53:31.68 --> 02:53:32.68
I dig it.

2632
02:53:32.68 --> 02:53:33.68
It's good.

2633
02:53:33.68 --> 02:53:34.68
It's very good actually.

2634
02:53:34.68 --> 02:53:35.68
Because here's the thing.

2635
02:53:35.68 --> 02:53:39.68
Like, yeah, you, well, even when you first, you see people do you think people in Nebraska care,

2636
02:53:39.68 --> 02:53:44.68
if it's certified organic or you think it's only 40 mile radius around L.A.

2637
02:53:44.68 --> 02:53:46.68
I think some people in Nebraska care.

2638
02:53:46.68 --> 02:53:47.68
That's what I think.

2639
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:47.68
Right.

2640
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:48.68
And this is why.

2641
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:49.68
Where is it?

2642
02:53:49.68 --> 02:53:53.68
Because when you first announced that you're drinking

2643
02:53:53.68 --> 02:53:55.68
pomegranate white tea.

2644
02:53:55.68 --> 02:53:56.68
Oh, yeah.

2645
02:53:56.68 --> 02:53:58.68
People were asking, is it organic?

2646
02:53:58.68 --> 02:53:59.68
Is that what you're going to say?

2647
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:00.68
That's part of it.

2648
02:54:00.68 --> 02:54:01.68
Yeah.

2649
02:54:01.68 --> 02:54:05.68
Something that whole experience for what primarily is like, all right, that's surprising.

2650
02:54:05.68 --> 02:54:08.68
That doesn't sound very hard core.

2651
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:11.68
You would think maybe you're drinking something else.

2652
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:14.68
But when you're like pomegranate white tea.

2653
02:54:14.68 --> 02:54:15.68
Okay.

2654
02:54:15.68 --> 02:54:17.68
Now we can do that or we could edit,

2655
02:54:17.68 --> 02:54:18.68
mid.

2656
02:54:18.68 --> 02:54:21.68
We drink these white teas, which is good.

2657
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:24.68
But a lot of our wives drink white tea.

2658
02:54:24.68 --> 02:54:27.68
And they tend to care about certified organic.

2659
02:54:27.68 --> 02:54:31.68
In my experience, which is very limited by the way.

2660
02:54:31.68 --> 02:54:36.68
So I'm saying pomegranate white tea.

2661
02:54:36.68 --> 02:54:39.68
Jocco white tea is for everybody.

2662
02:54:39.68 --> 02:54:44.68
And just because you're not all, I don't care about certified organic just because you're like that doesn't mean everyone else.

2663
02:54:44.68 --> 02:54:50.68
In fact, I don't think the majority of the people would rather be certified organic than non organic.

2664
02:54:50.68 --> 02:54:51.68
I would agree with that.

2665
02:54:51.68 --> 02:54:56.68
And the root of me drinking pomegranate white tea is when I used to

2666
02:54:56.68 --> 02:55:01.68
debrief seal potions out in the desert.

2667
02:55:01.68 --> 02:55:06.68
After they would get done with their brief and I would drink chocolate to drink and provide a time to get done.

2668
02:55:06.68 --> 02:55:09.68
I don't think he notes and just get into it.

2669
02:55:09.68 --> 02:55:11.68
But yeah, so check that as well.

2670
02:55:11.68 --> 02:55:12.68
It's good.

2671
02:55:12.68 --> 02:55:13.68
Also, jocco is a store.

2672
02:55:13.68 --> 02:55:14.68
It's called jocco store.

2673
02:55:14.68 --> 02:55:16.68
So you go to jocco store.com.

2674
02:55:16.68 --> 02:55:23.68
We do have t-shirts, hoodies, rash guards, hats, three kinds of hats.

2675
02:55:23.68 --> 02:55:26.68
By the way, three types of head gear.

2676
02:55:26.68 --> 02:55:30.68
By the way, women stuff, you know, decals and stickers.

2677
02:55:30.68 --> 02:55:34.68
These are all things if you want to represent while you're on the path.

2678
02:55:34.68 --> 02:55:35.68
Just plenty.

2679
02:55:35.68 --> 02:55:36.68
It was freedom.

2680
02:55:36.68 --> 02:55:38.68
Death core to the core.

2681
02:55:38.68 --> 02:55:39.68
I like it.

2682
02:55:39.68 --> 02:55:41.68
Good.

2683
02:55:41.68 --> 02:55:42.68
All these things.

2684
02:55:42.68 --> 02:55:44.68
And that's one that's going to permeate kind of everything.

2685
02:55:44.68 --> 02:55:45.68
The good.

2686
02:55:45.68 --> 02:55:47.68
You know, when you find the good in this situation, all these things you can represent.

2687
02:55:47.68 --> 02:55:48.68
Get your stuff.

2688
02:55:48.68 --> 02:55:49.68
Jocco store.com.

2689
02:55:49.68 --> 02:55:50.68
He likes something.

2690
02:55:50.68 --> 02:55:51.68
Get something on there.

2691
02:55:51.68 --> 02:55:57.68
Also, I got to mention that I have a little, I have some events I'm going to be doing around

2692
02:55:57.68 --> 02:56:03.68
the country starting in January around the time the book comes out a little bit earlier.

2693
02:56:03.68 --> 02:56:05.68
I'm going to be in Washington, DC, Austin, Texas.

2694
02:56:05.68 --> 02:56:07.68
I'm going to be somewhere in the vicinity of New York.

2695
02:56:07.68 --> 02:56:10.68
I'm going to be somewhere in the vicinity of LA.

2696
02:56:10.68 --> 02:56:15.68
Somewhere in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington and somewhere in the vicinity of San Francisco.

2697
02:56:15.68 --> 02:56:18.68
So I will let you know, but just pay attention.

2698
02:56:18.68 --> 02:56:21.68
I just got an email right before we started recording this.

2699
02:56:21.68 --> 02:56:24.68
That is actually factually happening.

2700
02:56:24.68 --> 02:56:26.68
I don't even know what I'm going to call it yet.

2701
02:56:26.68 --> 02:56:30.68
So I will be live on stage interacting.

2702
02:56:30.68 --> 02:56:32.68
So there you go.

2703
02:56:32.68 --> 02:56:33.68
Boom.

2704
02:56:33.68 --> 02:56:35.68
Also speaking of live.

2705
02:56:35.68 --> 02:56:40.68
But I imagine when I do those live events, there will be lots of people representing.

2706
02:56:40.68 --> 02:56:41.68
Representing.

2707
02:56:41.68 --> 02:56:45.68
They will be representing in their garments.

2708
02:56:45.68 --> 02:56:46.68
Oh, yes.

2709
02:56:46.68 --> 02:56:47.68
Death are on the path.

2710
02:56:47.68 --> 02:56:55.68
We normally see a lot of people that are wearing something that says Deaf Core or in the wild.

2711
02:56:55.68 --> 02:56:56.68
Yeah.

2712
02:56:56.68 --> 02:56:57.68
So there you go.

2713
02:56:57.68 --> 02:56:58.68
Big time.

2714
02:56:58.68 --> 02:57:02.68
Also subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already on your iTunes.

2715
02:57:02.68 --> 02:57:03.68
If you listen to iTunes.

2716

2718
02:57:06.68 --> 02:57:08.68
What's with the voice, bro?

2719
02:57:08.68 --> 02:57:12.68
No, I'm just just delegating the listening avenues.

2720
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:13.68
I'm saying.

2721
02:57:13.68 --> 02:57:14.68

If you're in the mood, if you're in the mood, leave a review.

2723
02:57:16.68 --> 02:57:18.68
We review is a welcome.

2724
02:57:18.68 --> 02:57:21.68
I haven't read reviews lately on the podcast.

2725
02:57:21.68 --> 02:57:22.68
But I've done that before.

2726
02:57:22.68 --> 02:57:23.68
I'll do it again.

2727
02:57:23.68 --> 02:57:24.68
I see some good ones.

2728
02:57:24.68 --> 02:57:26.68
Some ones that kind of nail it.

2729
02:57:26.68 --> 02:57:27.68
Yeah.

2730
02:57:27.68 --> 02:57:28.68
Kind of have layers.

2731
02:57:28.68 --> 02:57:29.68
We're looking for layers.

2732
02:57:29.68 --> 02:57:30.68
Yeah.

2733
02:57:30.68 --> 02:57:31.68
Primarily.

2734
02:57:31.68 --> 02:57:32.68
Yes.

2735
02:57:32.68 --> 02:57:34.68
So and you noticed they said welcome reviews are welcome.

2736
02:57:34.68 --> 02:57:37.68
Because it difference between welcome and accepted.

2737
02:57:37.68 --> 02:57:39.68
So already know reviews are accepted.

2738
02:57:39.68 --> 02:57:40.68
Where do you know you can write review?

2739
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:41.68
Are they expected?

2740
02:57:41.68 --> 02:57:42.68
You're not expected.

2741
02:57:42.68 --> 02:57:43.68
I wouldn't say it's just well.

2742
02:57:43.68 --> 02:57:44.68
Yeah.

2743
02:57:44.68 --> 02:57:45.68
Well, welcome.

2744
02:57:45.68 --> 02:57:48.68
Meaning like if there's a review, that's like we kind of like that.

2745
02:57:48.68 --> 02:57:53.68
Like we kind of, you know, like we kind of put the smile on certain people's faces.

2746
02:57:53.68 --> 02:57:55.68
And we're going to go ahead and read that one.

2747
02:57:55.68 --> 02:57:59.68
Don't forget that we have another podcast called Grounded.

2748
02:57:59.68 --> 02:58:04.68
It's just a podcast called Grounded where we talk about other things.

2749
02:58:04.68 --> 02:58:08.68
And I think that's the way you said this on the last little support section.

2750
02:58:08.68 --> 02:58:12.68
Because how do you describe what we talk about on Grounded?

2751
02:58:12.68 --> 02:58:15.68
And I think the answer is we talk about other things.

2752
02:58:15.68 --> 02:58:16.68
Yes.

2753
02:58:16.68 --> 02:58:17.68
You know what does that mean?

2754
02:58:17.68 --> 02:58:18.68
Well it's other things.

2755
02:58:18.68 --> 02:58:19.68
I think that's about.

2756
02:58:19.68 --> 02:58:20.68
I think that spells it out.

2757
02:58:20.68 --> 02:58:21.68
Yeah man.

2758
02:58:21.68 --> 02:58:22.68
Yeah.

2759
02:58:22.68 --> 02:58:23.68
As opposed to what?

2760
02:58:23.68 --> 02:58:24.68
These things.

2761
02:58:24.68 --> 02:58:25.68
It's not these things.

2762
02:58:25.68 --> 02:58:26.68
There's more other things.

2763
02:58:26.68 --> 02:58:27.68
Yeah.

2764
02:58:27.68 --> 02:58:28.68
Yeah.

2765
02:58:28.68 --> 02:58:29.68
Equally important things.

2766
02:58:29.68 --> 02:58:31.68
Well, very important.

2767
02:58:31.68 --> 02:58:34.68
Maybe not equally important.

2768
02:58:34.68 --> 02:58:35.68
Interesting.

2769
02:58:35.68 --> 02:58:36.68
Yes.

2770
02:58:36.68 --> 02:58:37.68
I think.

2771
02:58:37.68 --> 02:58:40.68
And here's something that is important.

2772
02:58:40.68 --> 02:58:43.68
I will say this.

2773
02:58:43.68 --> 02:58:52.68
Even though they might not be of equal importance, they are things that will grant you a better understanding,

2774
02:58:52.68 --> 02:58:54.68
a broader understanding of things.

2775
02:58:54.68 --> 02:58:55.68
Yes.

2776
02:58:55.68 --> 02:58:56.68
Of other things.

2777
02:58:56.68 --> 02:59:01.68
The more you understand other things, the more you'll understand these things.

2778
02:59:01.68 --> 02:59:02.68
That is true.

2779
02:59:02.68 --> 02:59:03.68
Yeah.

2780
02:59:03.68 --> 02:59:04.68
Very well put.

2781
02:59:04.68 --> 02:59:05.68
Thanks.

2782
02:59:05.68 --> 02:59:06.68
You need to change whatever that little.

2783
02:59:06.68 --> 02:59:07.68
You know how that.

2784
02:59:07.68 --> 02:59:09.68
You know, a podcast has a little.

2785
02:59:09.68 --> 02:59:11.68
No blurb about what it's about.

2786
02:59:11.68 --> 02:59:13.68
I don't think you've changed the jockel podcast.

2787
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:16.68
Once you wrote it when you were nine years old.

2788
02:59:16.68 --> 02:59:22.68
But you should make the ground to one say a podcast about other things.

2789
02:59:22.68 --> 02:59:23.68
Yeah.

2790
02:59:23.68 --> 02:59:24.68
All right.

2791
02:59:24.68 --> 02:59:25.68
I'm going to do that.

2792
02:59:25.68 --> 02:59:26.68
I do too.

2793
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:29.68
So for example, Jason Gardner talking about how he lives up in the mountains.

2794
02:59:29.68 --> 02:59:35.68
And when they go jogging, they got to carry guns just in case they get a fact by freaking mountain lions.

2795
02:59:35.68 --> 02:59:37.68
Those are other things we talk about.

2796
02:59:37.68 --> 02:59:39.68
That's a sense of the meaning.

2797
02:59:39.68 --> 02:59:41.68
But it's important to understand that.

2798
02:59:41.68 --> 02:59:42.68
Yes.

2799
02:59:42.68 --> 02:59:44.68
We also have a warrior kid podcast.

2800
02:59:44.68 --> 02:59:50.68
This is a great podcast not just for kids, but if you're a parent, you can use it to help you parent.

2801
02:59:50.68 --> 02:59:52.68
But you can also learn from it.

2802
02:59:52.68 --> 02:59:54.68
I am a parent.

2803
02:59:54.68 --> 02:59:56.68
I got four kids.

2804
02:59:56.68 --> 03:00:02.68
Two of which are over the age of 18, 20, 18, got a 16 year old and got a 10 year old.

2805
03:00:02.68 --> 03:00:06.68
I'm passing on some lessons learned covertly.

2806
03:00:06.68 --> 03:00:10.68
I'm flanking you with some lessons learned that will help you.

2807
03:00:10.68 --> 03:00:12.68
I wish I would have this podcast with my kids, re-honger.

2808
03:00:12.68 --> 03:00:14.68
But warrior kid podcast, let your kids check it out.

2809
03:00:14.68 --> 03:00:16.68
And don't forget to get yourself some warrior kid.

2810

So from Irish Oaks Ranch.com or young Aiden is kind of his own business.

2811
03:00:21.68 --> 03:00:23.68
And it's not just a business that's making money.

2812
03:00:23.68 --> 03:00:25.68
It's a business that's helping people.

2813
03:00:25.68 --> 03:00:27.68
Stay clean.

2814
03:00:27.68 --> 03:00:29.68
That's good.

2815
03:00:29.68 --> 03:00:30.68
There.

2816
03:00:30.68 --> 03:00:33.68
Speaking of staying clean, going YouTube.

2817
03:00:33.68 --> 03:00:36.68
I'm not.

2818
03:00:36.68 --> 03:00:39.68
There's a rough transition in the chat once.

2819
03:00:39.68 --> 03:00:41.68
You just called for bad.

2820
03:00:41.68 --> 03:00:42.68
No, no, no, no.

2821
03:00:42.68 --> 03:00:43.68
It does anyway.

2822
03:00:43.68 --> 03:00:46.68
So yeah, if you want to watch the podcast, watch and listen.

2823
03:00:46.68 --> 03:00:50.68
Put on your smart TV and your office, Jim.

2824
03:00:50.68 --> 03:00:54.68
It's a place of, you know, place of workout.

2825
03:00:54.68 --> 03:00:57.68
You see what I'm saying?

2826
03:00:57.68 --> 03:00:58.68
I know what you're saying.

2827
03:00:58.68 --> 03:01:00.68
Or if you just want to watch it, it can be the anyway.

2828
03:01:00.68 --> 03:01:01.68
It's a video version.

2829

You know, because some people, because video watching video smart TVs, the permeation

2830
03:01:07.68 --> 03:01:08.68
permeation.

2831
03:01:08.68 --> 03:01:10.68
I don't know what that was your talking about.

2832
03:01:10.68 --> 03:01:13.68
That's the prevalence of smart TVs.

2833
03:01:13.68 --> 03:01:15.68
This is what I'm saying.

2834
03:01:15.68 --> 03:01:18.68
You're good at more YouTube is what I'm saying.

2835
03:01:18.68 --> 03:01:20.68
You're gonna have more of the, you know, Jim saying.

2836
03:01:20.68 --> 03:01:21.68
So boom, subscribe.

2837
03:01:21.68 --> 03:01:22.68

Put it on there.

2839
03:01:23.68 --> 03:01:24.68
Listen to it.

03:01:24.68 --> 03:01:25.68
Do it.

Do it.

2842
03:01:26.68 --> 03:01:30.68
And if you need some, um, some psychological help getting through a moment of weakness.

2843
03:01:30.68 --> 03:01:32.68
You don't have to be alone.

2844
03:01:32.68 --> 03:01:33.68
You don't have to be alone.

2845
03:01:33.68 --> 03:01:35.68
You have to fight that fight by yourself.

2846
03:01:35.68 --> 03:01:43.68
You can get fire support when you press play on your phone of an album called Psychological

2847
03:01:43.68 --> 03:01:44.68
Warfare.

2848
03:01:44.68 --> 03:01:47.68
The artist known as me, Jaco.

Lay it now tracks.

2850
03:01:48.68 --> 03:01:49.68
No music.

2851
03:01:49.68 --> 03:01:50.68
Just voice.

2852
03:01:50.68 --> 03:01:55.68
Just me talking and telling you, hey, this is what you can do to overcome that particular

2853
03:01:55.68 --> 03:01:56.68
moment of weakness.

2854
03:01:56.68 --> 03:01:58.68
Whether it's you're thinking you don't want to go to the gym.

2855
03:01:58.68 --> 03:01:59.68
Whether you think you're gonna eat a donut.

2856
03:01:59.68 --> 03:02:02.68
No press play on your phone and take a listen.

2857
03:02:02.68 --> 03:02:03.68
Take a listen.

2858
03:02:03.68 --> 03:02:04.68
We'll get you right.

2859
03:02:04.68 --> 03:02:05.68
We'll keep you on the path.

2860
03:02:05.68 --> 03:02:10.68
And if you need a visual reminder to be on the path to stay on the path.

2861
03:02:10.68 --> 03:02:14.68
Check out flipside canvas dot com with the code of Meyer.

2862
03:02:14.68 --> 03:02:17.68
It's to code of Meyer's company.

2863
03:02:17.68 --> 03:02:28.68
And he's creating graphic visual designs that will help remind you where you are.

2864
03:02:28.68 --> 03:02:29.68
Where you are.

2865
03:02:29.68 --> 03:02:31.68
Where you're going.

2866
03:02:31.68 --> 03:02:33.68
And where you want to be.

2867
03:02:33.68 --> 03:02:35.68

2868
03:02:35.68 --> 03:02:36.68
Also, I have some books.

2869
03:02:36.68 --> 03:02:42.68
The first book is the stress effect written by Colonel Henry Dick Thompson.

2870
03:02:42.68 --> 03:02:43.68
So we just reviewed that.

2871
03:02:43.68 --> 03:02:45.68
It's an outstanding book.

2872
03:02:45.68 --> 03:02:47.68
There's all kinds of information in there.

2873
03:02:47.68 --> 03:02:49.68
I only read a small percentage of it.

2874
03:02:49.68 --> 03:02:53.68
But tons of knowledge.

2875
03:02:53.68 --> 03:02:54.68
So order that.

2876
03:02:54.68 --> 03:02:57.68

03:02:57.68 --> 03:03:01.68

Hands off leadership.

2895
03:03:40.68 --> 03:03:41.68
Head counts.

2896
03:03:41.68 --> 03:03:42.68
Heavy handed approach.

2897
03:03:42.68 --> 03:03:43.68
High ground.

2898
03:03:43.68 --> 03:03:45.68
High risk operations.

03:03:46.68 --> 03:03:47.68
Hope.

2901
03:03:47.68 --> 03:03:48.68
Humility.

2902
03:03:48.68 --> 03:03:50.68
These are some of the topics that get covered.

2903
03:03:50.68 --> 03:03:52.68
And the leadership strategy.

2904
03:03:52.68 --> 03:03:55.68
I've been doing this for a while.

2905
03:03:55.68 --> 03:03:58.68
I've been doing this for a while.

2906
03:03:58.68 --> 03:04:00.68
So you can refer to it.

2907
03:04:00.68 --> 03:04:04.68
You can open it up and say, hey, I got a person that I'm that is.

2908
03:04:04.68 --> 03:04:06.68
Has a negative attitude.

2909
03:04:06.68 --> 03:04:07.68
What's I do with them.

2910
03:04:07.68 --> 03:04:11.68
Oh, I'll open up the field manual and follow the directions.

2911
03:04:11.68 --> 03:04:13.68
