I mean rich serving next to poor northern or serving next to southern or like you know black white Asian Hispanic Muslim Christian atheist Sabot was a Satanist I mean all in the same fox woman and it's like you know what I mean like in America like I feel like we're divided amongst those lines But in an infantry battalion and in a combat unit you address it directly and in a way you transcend those stupid petty differences And this is like why I always say like real leaders unite they don't they don't they don't devise you know This is not this is not healthy But that's how they were like piles of human shit everywhere big intense volleyball game like you know the Afghan I mean it was just the craziest crazy crazy shit you ever see in your life It's crazy it's weird like when we'd go and take over a building like if we're gonna stay in a building for a few days Within I'm not kidding within a half an hour Guys would be fixing stuff and like rerouting things and hey, let's get this building and you you go into some Iraqi family They've been living there for however many however many decades and they would still have like You know in their kitchen there'd be a little hole next to the wall where they would take a shit and then they would kind of push it out through the hole in the wall And that's just that's just how it was and I always thought to myself Americans are kind of crazy in the other direction We look at something and go, oh, you know what this is I'm just gonna fix this. They're all carrying this guy out of my batain commander runs by and he's like What are these idiots doing hey, you know, you're not supposed to have a platoon got it didn't matter Like carry it everywhere and and when we got to Afghanistan that You know, I'll just sit and brought me on board with branding in a big way, you know, they these guys That that became their collective identity, you know, and that's the thing about the military that is truly remarkable right like they They teach you to shoot movement communicate together and then you go to combat and you fight bleeding Died together, you know, and that's one of the things I always talk about about going home is like when you come home It was a nightmare and We came out of that and it was like I remember just being like ACUs were like our army combat uniforms were like just DRAWS has drenched, you know Walking in I mean the defa everyone's got their little trays and they're like high five and everybody was like you know like Imagine being an artist you training to be an artist and never painting a painting right Yeah, you know the fact that you know an infantry petune on the border of Afghanistan got a B1 strategic answer capable dropping like You know, I don't even know I couldn't even tell you like 20 30 Jdms You know Jdms a joint direct attack munition on target I mean we I'm telling you we must have at least 11 Probably more like 22 we dropped over the course of that engagement it was just You know because it didn't just end after the enemy broke contact right they were still taking pot shots well after With the initial forces broken contact because we had to get a record up there to get our trucks out I mean for me as a leader I was not willing to delegate that you know I feel like in other words I always wanted to be I was wanted to be a part of that I was wanted to have some sort of command Command supervisor authority on that aspect of you know I was always in the fight I wanted to be in the fight I wanted to be a contact with a heavy I also wanted to be involved in those types of decisions and so I think you know you mentioned something about Just talking to your guys about how you feel too So many leaders in the military don't do that and what I mean by that is they it especially in the infantry Where leaders don't share their own vulnerabilities like hey man like I feel the same way that you do like I Want to go out there and kill every one of those little bastards. Sometimes people will say you know jokko you talk a lot about tactics like don't you think the enemy's gonna gonna like learn these tactics I'm like the enemy absolutely knows these tactics that the tactics that talk about our cover and move You know set up support by fire positions maneuver you know like that's what I talk about time There's no secret to this stuff you either know how to do it and if you do it how well can you do it I had no infantry training whatsoever When I took over my Patoon they sent me like I got basically a call from my infantry branch manager saying like You know hey congratulations, you know you got your brands transferred infantry you're going to range or school in February and I was like oh Shit, it's like I went to range or school failed the first time like you know pretty much I do everything And Abdul's family in this regard would wake up every day Walk out to their front door and there'd be a letter stape odor You know nailed to their front door, which is basically threats like if if If Abdul continues to work with and support the Americans we're gonna kill him and kill your family and so Abdul would get word of these night letters On our base now we were at Ford operating base for Mel and so Burmel was about five clicks from the border and right south Just directly south east of us were scanned 45 minute drive south was scanning and they would Army special forces would rotate in and out of there and skin is sort of famous for being co-located with with what they call an Afghanistan The Alamo, which is a like a little bee hut where like these you know secret squirrel types would sit there with like They're a little calm stuff and listen to like what the Taliban were talking about But there is there's an outpost there and Abdul's family lived right there And I really never I don't feel like I ever had a healthy answer to that question The way that I answered it in that moment was like, I'm just going to Take this experience and lock it away deep in the deepest recesses of myself And my mind and my consciousness and never talk about it again Pretend like it didn't happen Flip that emotional switch You know, shield myself from the pain of it And let's, you know, to me, like, you know, this is not like a by the way This is not a poor me store, I volunteered for this, I do it all again And a second, I don't regret a single second of my experience The military does a damn good job training you to go, shoot, rifle, and But he wrote that book before any of these other Vietnam war books came out and in that book he He talks about you know he describes the platoon and it's all the stereotypical characters better in a platoon and What's what's amazing about it is like they those were the real guys that weren't his platoon those the characters You describe those the characters that are never every major Vietnam movie that there is from platoon to a populist now Like they all have this to full metal Jack they all have the same stereotypical American cross cut right the city slicker the the country kid, you know Like the the Chubby dumb kid that doesn't like they got all the stereotypes and you know as I'm reading your stuff It was terrible the way that it happened to went down It's just like you know you come down red as a captain in a battalion And a senior captain on my way to 04 my way to major And a battalion like there are only so many senior captain no four slots come down red in a powerpoint slide It's like we got to get this guy out of here and it's like I can't move any faster than the med board process You know it's like once it gets up to the big army and so we get back to biogram though, man, and it's like It's like amazing, you know, there there are I'm like walking down on my covered dirt fell with blood and muck I take a warm showers much hot waters just want they got these like sauna like wood panels I'm walking on I'm like this is great. Like the juxtaposition of two cells like warrior and civilian you know You know just straight killer or liberator and protector and like I it to me in that moment You know, I think just think the awesome responsibility of being a young leader whether you're a young NCO team leader squad leader Paltoon sergeant Paltoon they didn't matter Um every leader in combat has a moral obligation to be the moral compass of their Paltoon or their unit their small unit and that means that You've got to do everything that you can to keep those troops when they're in the shit Tethered to who they are you know not let them Reveal in the bloodlust too much because if you do that you lose who you are you lose you lose what you lose your human side and for me So we wear body armor and we carry radios and They carry what they can't 404 Mags some frags and And there are climate ties like they're all used to running around at 12,000 feet, you know, so they Scale up the side of a mountain better than a mountain go can, you know, and that they should the people that we're fighting, you know, and what we had started to see on the battlefield You know any time you're in Afghanistan, it's like you deal with you know anything from Al Qaeda to the Connie network to hack Modear to the Taliban sometimes in this engagement what we were seeing Was cross training and so you'd see Al Qaeda foreign commanders You know commanding and leading ground troops who were just local Taliban and Man it was it was just a wicked wicked wicked fight And I'm glad when people come out and explain what it's like for real on the front lines Because you know we just talked about that that psychological thing of getting home or Getting to get to sleep and be warm and comfortable and then having to go back and you guys got that to the end degree I think it was by far the most difficult part of our entire deployment because if you think about the history of any military You know in the days of Sparta like and you were called to arms like you were directly responsible for how good You were with your weapon system you had your own weapons as you trained on it you lived or died by it, you know and I think we killed I think I mean we got attacked by like probably 30 or 40 guys that day I think that was what the report said in the aftermath I think we killed six or seven of them At least you know, I mean couldn't really find any They're so good at casivac, but We killed at least six or seven of them that day and and for me like I remember coming back to the defac and at the end of that fight I didn't even know if I still didn't know if if I had made a colossal mistake and I'm gonna walk into the defac I'm telling you so we were into all kinds of shows over there You know the whole putton we gather around this is like I mean we had these like little Laptop computers we all sit around like screen this big and watch these shows but the office was one of those things That it was just like holy shit like look at what we just talked about how much of a I mean it's just the most sad depressing thing. I just I mean like thinking of myself like sorry Just got off a goddamn bird like Jesus like and then of course He's like you don't want to be about taking the magazine out on my weapon like because you're not supposed to have a magazine on your weapon A biogram you're supposed to wear a road guard belt everywhere you go. And I feel like you know so much of leadership is just like showing up, you know showing that you care like Trooping the line and combat or walking through the barracks at night or just you know Being there with them in those little moments where you're not maybe Intimately involved pound and beers with them in the barracks, but you're like they see you But we can't do that and so just being able to identify with your men on that level is it not only does it bring you closer to them I think it ingratiate them to you as a leader as well where they think like okay, you know my leader's not some abstract person out there He feels the same pain that we do he's in this with us and You know it goes back to sort of the established and that collected by identity like if you're a part of that collective identity as a leader I feel like those sorts of commands Are more likely to be to be followed in that line that you walk while it is a certainly a fine one Your best chance of staying on the right side of that is operating like that. He was like This is the greatest shit I've experienced this Columbia and I'm like all right sir calm down Let's like let's let you know like let's he's like what we can do what we can do we can counter attack We need to take the fight on my co-case or yeah, and You know we got in a few fights and we started to Did you know we started to have this reputation in our area of operations of like The green skulls and it got to be weird listen to the the enemies communications on their little icons and they be like Oh, it's the green skulls like wait for another unit where like That's what I'm talking about yeah, That's what they're capable of and in this village there's no way that I mean we didn't ever even come into contact with them There were so many small border villages And the Hindu-Kish mountains that have not even talked to a tribe that's a click down the road let alone ever seen an American troop There's no just the mere thought that They may have been working with Americans was enough to cause something like that It just shows you the depth and the prairie the enemy that we're fighting is why we fight against them This is why Americans are there this is why we matter this is the why the way that we fight matters You know there is a right and wrong to how the world You know conducts itself, you know I firmly believe that You know some cultures are better than others, you know I think our Western culture should be preserved and fought for and protected and promulgated as much as possible We live in the best country on the face of the earth why shouldn't we try to do that for other people and you know I saw something on your make-out inside not that's I love it my man to say like you know You're last Instagram me some video view poem back this big bone like God damn I got to go on a podcast of this guy like I was just playing Pokemon with my son I'm not this is not who I am you know this guy's gonna kill me No, that's awesome, but And your default is to attack all the time your men know exactly what they're supposed to do the moment that they get shot at the moment that you're attacked and it is to attack and One thing that is infinitely easier is to is to call guys and real them in like say okay guys Are guess what you know what we're not going like when you make the decision we're gonna break contact instead Okay, that's something that Where is if people don't know what they're gonna do You know what I mean like I look at some things that I experience in combat I'm like you know if somebody would have told me that that could actually happen I would have said it's like it's like you watch in a movie. I got my squad that you're screaming that they're going black on ammunition I'm thinking of like Joshua Chamberland and like holy shit I'm gonna have to order a pay net char and time to the teeth of the enemy and then I remember This computer by trice like thinking Jesus Christ the army doesn't issue us bay and that's anymore like this is like this is crazy But I could believe that I wrote it I mean it was one of those is like I literally didn't care like hey, you know It was like a he had sent out an email and I sent he'd sent out like kind of a group wide email to all the officers You know asking for some feedback But young guys like me who made it most of the butoon like we didn't and it felt like a betrayal You know almost by like a parent and that violation of trust you know how we felt about it at the time yeah when he said that I was I at that point I was like Holy shit, you know like for a lieutenant like my biggest weapon is my radio and if it's time for like me to start shooting back It's a it's a real real bad day for everybody, but that's where we were you could hear these guys Not only and you you detail this in the book it's Scary you hear him calling out all the lock bar which okay, but then what what Because we've all heard that okay, I made it This like a logic that made it you brain dumb stubby let your hair down a little bit you kick back you smile You everything just feels a little bit better life the world just feels a little bit more colorful like you're not looking through You know dirt and crusted window all the time right that everything it's like Everything's amazing food tastes better water tastes better your workouts are better like everything is better But I my point is we had guys army guys and Marines Primarily army that had definitely we had to overcome a Pregnitist against special operations because they had had real bad kind of experiences that you're talking about in there and again like you said You know what there's great SF teams there's there's great seal teams there's horrible ones Just like there's great infantry battalions and great infantry companies and there's shady ones as well Absolutely kind of you you kind of just have to you have to look at what you're dealing with but my point is If you're out there be one of the good ones be someone that's gonna listen you know when we got to Ramadi There was a it was a national guard unit on the ground out of Pennsylvania the 2 to 8 I remember it was Guy then went to ROTC was But I couldn't bring myself to do it, just stared at that uniform On the floor of my hooch and I just like how trying to ask, you know, trying to I feel like answer a pretty simple question And that we know I was 24 years old I had never been in charge of anything before my entire life The job that I had before the one that I had right now was, you know, history major You know, the biggest responsibility that I had before I was just taking over that pontoon was trying to get the class on time But when they're you know one of the things that I talked about with my men a lot right it was something that like We trained all the time by the way and we addressed this in our training the enemy would did would hone and Evolve their TTPs and so we would as well we never stopped training and so that was how we were different from the lot of the other units in Afghanistan I think can come back on the base and just chill and relax, but no you've got a train you've got a train on escalation of force and in that as part of that training Whether you're evolving your TTPs or otherwise You've got to talk to them about our responsibility on the battlefield to take care of the enemy if they're wounded You know I cannot tell you how many times I had you know I had troops that Soldiers that wanted to put a bullet in a guy that was wounded on the battlefield how I wanted to with every fiber of who I was That's one of those attitudes that you know I call that attitude being Default aggressive like our default mode is we're gonna attack you that's the way it's gonna be and if you have that The amount of power that that gives to a to a team is like look if we get pushed We're gonna attack that's what we're gonna do if that's what everyone's thinking it gives you like a super power Because that's just a unified attitude that we're gonna go attack you absolutely and then and here's the thing It's empowering But we would tell them like man like if you're gonna be in a turret you gotta wear your helmet You can't go out there with your New York Yankees baseball hat on like I know that looks cool, but that's not you you really need to listen to what we're saying And I feel like some of them really paid the price. Well, there's no way and hell that I was gonna allow that to happen to my troops Yep, you know if I if I'm the cool guy if I'm the guy letting let and Trupper's get away with shit like taking off their helmets or whatever Unbutton and their helmets straps and their turrets then and someone gets killed like I'm the guy that has to look for that forever So those tough decisions about like waking up early standing in the proper uniform wearing the right eye protection I mean come on if you let a soldier downgrade their uniform and downgrade their protective gear Someone gets hurt.
