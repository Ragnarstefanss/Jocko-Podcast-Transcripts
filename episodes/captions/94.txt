[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 94.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:12] The black cloud of smoke exploded silently outside the open door of the decoda of
[00:00:17] scurrying for the moment my view of the geometrical Dutch landscape deserted, but for a few
[00:00:24] for Lauren cows.
[00:00:27] As soon as the sea had appeared below us, I started to think about the flag, and I knew that everyone
[00:00:32] else in the aircraft must be worrying as well.
[00:00:36] When we crossed the east Anglican coastline, that slight wave of movement had flickered down
[00:00:42] the aircraft as the men checked their watches, calculating the time it would take to fly
[00:00:47] over the sea and come within range of the now alerted German anti-aircraft guns.
[00:00:53] Below us, the air sea rescue launches of the RAF, dotting the water at precise intervals
[00:00:59] were pleasantly comforting.
[00:01:02] The narrow band of beach, which was the coast of Holland, had aroused us once again.
[00:01:08] As the flooded fields flashed into view, private harrisid had leaned across to point
[00:01:13] out the guns and the ground shooting up at the mast ranks of our aircraft.
[00:01:19] At the sound of my batman's voice, which had been silent for the past hour, the men near
[00:01:24] to the open doorway had creamed forward to see what they could, while the rest, anxious
[00:01:29] for the first indications of the enemy, had twisted their necks to peer through the small
[00:01:34] windows at their backs.
[00:01:37] At first I could see nothing, and I was stupidly aggravated that everyone but myself could
[00:01:45] spot gun flashes.
[00:01:48] When came that cloud of smoke producing an odd sense of satisfaction, a reaction which immediately
[00:01:54] shamed me.
[00:01:57] This was the behavior of a small boy.
[00:02:00] For all that, it was satisfying not to feel scared by it.
[00:02:04] Perhaps it was because the experience was not only novel, but in some way, impersonal.
[00:02:12] Looking down the dark tunnel of the aircraft at the double line of soldiers, it was a relief
[00:02:16] to see that all traces of nervousness had disappeared.
[00:02:21] We had been waiting a long time for this.
[00:02:29] So that is the opening of a book called Men at Arnim.
[00:02:36] It was actually sent to me by a guy by the name of James Fennelun and the book was originally
[00:02:44] published under the pseudonym Tom Angus.
[00:02:48] It was about this battle at this place called Arnim, which is in Holland.
[00:02:55] In the book, the units that are doing the fighting, they're not identified.
[00:02:59] They don't say what units they are, but shortly after the book was published, it became
[00:03:05] very clear and it was revealed that the author was an individual named Jeffrey Powell, a British
[00:03:13] Army officer, and that the unit that the book talks about was the 156th Parishute Battalion
[00:03:20] of the British Army, who fought against all odds.
[00:03:27] And really, with misfortune after misfortune for eight days during operation, market garden,
[00:03:37] which is a famous World War II operation, a bold and super aggressive plan, and also the
[00:03:46] largest airborne operation up until that point.
[00:03:50] And the goal was to isolate parts of the German forces and to cut off what's known as the
[00:04:01] road district, which is like the heart of German industry, and then open up a route going
[00:04:08] from through that whole area, take control of the roads in the bridges and be able to punch
[00:04:14] right into the heart of Germany.
[00:04:17] Over 40,000 airborne troops took part in the operation, including America's 80 second
[00:04:25] airborne and the 101st airborne divisions.
[00:04:28] But the deepest, those that jumped deepest into enemy territory were from the British First
[00:04:36] Airborne Division, and that included this battalion, the 156th Parishute Battalion.
[00:04:45] And if you know anything about Operation Market Garden, although it did achieve some beneficial
[00:04:54] things, overall, the mission was considered a failure because it didn't actually achieve
[00:05:01] the objectives that it wanted to achieve.
[00:05:03] And as you can imagine, those that were furthest out suffered some absolutely catastrophic
[00:05:11] casualties and people taking prisoner and people killed in action.
[00:05:18] And this is only an eight day.
[00:05:20] This is eight days long.
[00:05:21] So this is this period that we're about to cover is only eight days long, and you're
[00:05:25] going to see that it is vicious.
[00:05:29] And the names were changed in this book.
[00:05:34] But again, this is an account from one of the company commanders inside this battalion.
[00:05:48] So obviously the opening was them flying over to the English Channel and getting ready
[00:05:55] to jump in to Holland.
[00:05:57] And here we go back to the book.
[00:05:59] I braaced myself with the open door, the first man in the stick to jump, gripping the
[00:06:03] fuselage, in case a sudden jerk flung me out too soon.
[00:06:08] Leaning forward, the wind whipped my face, pouring over the details of the plastic Dutch
[00:06:13] landscape below, I could now see one or two cyclists dotting the otherwise deserted country
[00:06:19] side.
[00:06:20] The flicker of the red warning light near my face told me that there was one minute
[00:06:24] to go.
[00:06:26] A railway line flashed below.
[00:06:28] The pattern of the woods was familiar as the view of the stable yard from the office
[00:06:32] window.
[00:06:33] The air photographs and the briefing model of the ground had imprinted the shapes on
[00:06:38] my mind.
[00:06:40] The pilots were dead on target.
[00:06:43] More often than not, in the old days, we had been dropped to stray, but these yanks always
[00:06:48] learned from their mistakes.
[00:06:51] I never saw the red light turn to green.
[00:06:53] Harrison's hand slapped my shoulder.
[00:06:55] I was out of the door.
[00:06:57] The slipstream hit me, flicking me sideways and I fell away just catching a glimpse of
[00:07:02] Harrison in the air above me and the tail of the aircraft flashing out of sight.
[00:07:07] When I was floating suspended gently in mid air, my parachute can be high.
[00:07:15] I looked up at the sky, choked with hundreds of swaying parachutes, most of them patterned
[00:07:21] and green and brown camouflage, but other, others in a galaxy of colors, red and orange,
[00:07:26] purple, blue and yellow vivid against the scattered white clouds.
[00:07:32] Every moment more aircraft arrived to discord, their car goes into the crowded
[00:07:36] air.
[00:07:38] Then I noticed the humming.
[00:07:41] We were being shot at from the ground.
[00:07:44] There were both on the drop zone.
[00:07:47] Something was badly wrong and opposed landing with the enemy firing as we hung from our
[00:07:52] parachutes.
[00:07:53] Parachutes were tried to collect our weapons before we could gather into a cohesive force
[00:07:57] on the ground with something new for us in the British airborne forces.
[00:08:02] So as they're coming down, they're getting shot at. He uses this term throughout the book.
[00:08:07] He calls the German boche BOCHE and where it comes from from what I gathered.
[00:08:18] There's a French word that means it could mean head like Kabosh or something like that.
[00:08:26] It also can mean cabbage and so I guess their their their derogatory slang term was
[00:08:33] these big headed German big cabbage heads and he reduced that down to this term boche and
[00:08:39] it's a common one for them to use.
[00:08:41] They used it a lot in World War I and so this is a hangover from that, but you're
[00:08:46] going to hear it throughout the book.
[00:08:47] That's how he's referring to the Germans.
[00:08:50] Back to the book a sharp pain burned the knuckles of my left hand.
[00:08:54] Blood was seeping from my fingers, a bullet must have hit me, grazed me anyways.
[00:08:59] But now the Heathland was rushing up, raising my hands to lift the webs I pulled and then
[00:09:06] hit the and then the ground hit me with an uncomfortable jar, a bad landing.
[00:09:11] I lay in the sunken road listening to the bullets cracking overhead.
[00:09:19] And they're right, they get right into the mix.
[00:09:22] I mean it's immediately into the mix obviously they're getting shot out in the way down
[00:09:25] and then what soon does they hit the ground?
[00:09:27] It's on back to the book a man with bloodstained shell dressing wrapped around his throat
[00:09:32] walked around the corner of the wooding towards us just as preacher to who's the medic
[00:09:37] finished his work.
[00:09:38] Then came a couple of parties carrying stretchers, the occupant of one unconscious, the
[00:09:43] other with a cigarette between his gray tight lips.
[00:09:47] They were the first stream of wounded men from a variety of units, making their painful
[00:09:52] way towards the dressing station which had been set up in the wood behind us.
[00:09:57] So far sea company had been lucky.
[00:10:00] Only four men were missing and a fifth had turned up late smiling cheerfully despite
[00:10:04] a bullet through his bandaged arm.
[00:10:07] Another four or five were limping and hopping about on strained or twisted ankles, expressions
[00:10:12] of disgust in their faces, victims of the gusty wind on the dropping zone.
[00:10:18] All of them would have to be left behind.
[00:10:21] But then I thought again calculating the figures once more, perhaps we had not been so lucky
[00:10:25] after all, a tenth of the men who had implained that morning were already casualties.
[00:10:33] It had sounded as if all the fighting had happened on the far side of the dropping zone
[00:10:37] in the arm hem dirt direction.
[00:10:40] Now the noise of the battle began to ebb.
[00:10:42] The enemy posts had probably been overrun.
[00:10:46] Neither news nor orders had arrived from battalion headquarters.
[00:10:51] But I knew better than to obstruct the radio net with needless questions.
[00:10:55] So first of all, you're rolling into a situation where you're on your insert and you lose
[00:11:01] 10% of your men.
[00:11:03] That's just where you're starting to know.
[00:11:04] If I remember correctly, that is the standard kind of figure that when you're conducting
[00:11:12] a big airborne operation, like when the army conducts big airborne operations, that's
[00:11:16] what they figure.
[00:11:17] They're going to take for casualties on the drop zone.
[00:11:20] Obviously they usually do better than that.
[00:11:22] But for worst case scenarios, that's kind of what they figure.
[00:11:24] And that's where they're at.
[00:11:26] The other thing that I thought was cool is here he is.
[00:11:29] He hasn't heard any word from the battalion HQ yet, but he's not going to jump on the net
[00:11:32] and say, hey, boss, what do you want me to do?
[00:11:34] Hey, what's going on?
[00:11:35] Hey, where do you want me to be?
[00:11:36] Because there's other people that are trying to talk and he's got to just kind of figure
[00:11:40] things out at this point.
[00:11:45] Now he's talking about his own company.
[00:11:49] But here's the report on the rest of the battalion as he figures off.
[00:11:53] And as usual, obviously, I'm not reading the whole book.
[00:11:56] And I'm skipping through big chunks of combat situations.
[00:12:00] But at this point, he figures out what's going on with the battalion going back to the book.
[00:12:04] Casualties in the battalion had not been light.
[00:12:07] Two officers and a hundred men had failed to arrive, among them the plain load which we had
[00:12:13] seen shot down.
[00:12:16] Another load had probably been dropped in the wrong place.
[00:12:20] Ian Hampshire was one of the missing officers.
[00:12:22] Rumor had it that he was dead.
[00:12:25] The other was the intelligence officer whose job Jimmy Gray had now combined with his own.
[00:12:31] Jimmy could not explain the reason for the delay.
[00:12:35] No one seemed to know.
[00:12:37] And that's one of the parts that I didn't go over in the beginning of the book as they're
[00:12:41] flying in as they're seeing flack hit and explode around them.
[00:12:45] He's, you know, they see another one of their aircraft filled with their brothers go down.
[00:12:51] No shoots.
[00:12:55] Now they start getting some coherent input from the battalion and here's what they figured
[00:13:02] out coming back to the book.
[00:13:04] We would move as had already been planned in England.
[00:13:07] The leading company of the battalion with Leslie Doyle's platoon, number nine in the front,
[00:13:12] some 200 yards ahead followed by company headquarters, then Luke Tyler's eight platoon,
[00:13:19] then Douglas Thompson's seven platoon at the back.
[00:13:23] As I had expected, the company was ready to move by the time orders had been given out.
[00:13:29] Two minutes were all that was needed for the men to slide their entrenching tools into
[00:13:33] place, pick up their weapons and sort themselves out.
[00:13:36] No one had removed his equipment.
[00:13:38] It was a lesson which the Colonel had drummed into us.
[00:13:41] No man must ever remove his equipment when the enemy is anywhere near, no matter whether
[00:13:45] he was digging, sleeping, or defecating.
[00:13:49] Never time it may be, day or night, a soldier had only to reach for his weapon to be ready
[00:13:53] to fight or to march.
[00:13:56] Just once this day, just once each day, one man in three at a time was allowed to strip
[00:14:01] so that he could wash and shave and shave they must.
[00:14:06] The last man of nine platoon was disappearing round the corner of the sandy track which
[00:14:10] ran parallel with the railway, line to our nem, when I noticed the Colonel standing
[00:14:16] on the right next to the shell of a still smoking glider which partly blocked the battalion's
[00:14:22] path.
[00:14:23] There was parachuteers that came in, but other people came in on gliders.
[00:14:27] Just big gliders.
[00:14:29] No engine that would get towed by other planes, they're filled with men and they would just
[00:14:33] land these gliders in big open fields.
[00:14:40] The railway was up by the Colonel's side and behind them crouched a knot of radio operators and order
[00:14:45] leaves.
[00:14:46] It was the same as ever.
[00:14:48] The Colonel's eyes were still, but he never missed anything.
[00:14:53] The unfassened pouch from which a grenade or brand magazine could slip.
[00:14:57] The slack chin strap which would fail to hold a running man's steel helmet in place.
[00:15:02] Quietly, the Colonel would indicate the error to whichever passing officer or n-seal was
[00:15:08] responsible for the man.
[00:15:11] Nothing was ever ignored.
[00:15:14] Safely out of range the offender would mumble about the nitpicking old bastard, but the
[00:15:19] abuse was usually perfunctory and good natured.
[00:15:24] All of the new his ways and by now they had learned that his fads mattered.
[00:15:30] So the Colonel's running a tight ship.
[00:15:33] Hmm.
[00:15:34] That's what he's doing.
[00:15:35] Highly disciplined guy and he keeps his troops in check.
[00:15:39] And as you can see they're not offended by that.
[00:15:42] They complain about it a little bit, but they also know it's the right thing.
[00:15:50] Here we go back to the book.
[00:15:51] Although we were moving along our planned route, our role in the battle had been changed.
[00:15:56] Instead of making for the high ground north of Arnem, the whole of the brigade was now
[00:16:01] marching for the bridge to relieve the struggling remnants of the first brigade which
[00:16:05] had been fighting alone there for more than 24 hours.
[00:16:09] One thing was certain.
[00:16:11] So they're mission to change a little bit.
[00:16:13] There's a bridge and first brigade was at this bridge and taken the bridge, but now they're
[00:16:17] getting attacked at that bridge by the Germans.
[00:16:20] And now these guys get this brigade gets the orders to go and help them, go and relieve
[00:16:26] them.
[00:16:27] Back to the book.
[00:16:28] One was certain, parachute infantry were not the fast moving hard-hitting troops depicted
[00:16:33] by the daily press.
[00:16:35] With no more transport in a battalion than four lightly armored carriers and some half
[00:16:40] dozen jeeps nearly everything needed in battle either had to be carried on the backs of soldiers
[00:16:46] or dragged behind them.
[00:16:49] There were no trucks just behind the forward companies loaded with spare ammunition.
[00:16:53] Instead, extra band allures were strong around necks and light anti-tank mines swung from
[00:16:59] waste belts.
[00:17:02] Success came with surprise in this sort of fighting.
[00:17:05] The enemy must be caught unaware and crushed before they could recover.
[00:17:11] Inevitably we would run short of ammunition if the boat were allowed the chance of standing
[00:17:17] in fighting.
[00:17:19] This weary trudge toward the bridge and our necks along the endless tracks was a crazy
[00:17:24] way to use airborne troops.
[00:17:28] Surprise had been lost long ago.
[00:17:30] Before the operation started, I doubted the wisdom of dropping so far from the bridges.
[00:17:36] Now it was clear that it had been a mistake.
[00:17:40] So they're in a radically different situation.
[00:17:42] Instead of dropping in and holding some ground, now they're moving, they have to carry
[00:17:46] all their gear with them.
[00:17:49] It's not a good situation.
[00:17:53] These talking about some of the guys are carrying it as much as a hundred pounds, which
[00:17:58] is a ton of weight.
[00:18:00] And now they get word from the kernel.
[00:18:04] Back to the book, he was able to confirm that the first parachute brigade was still holding
[00:18:09] out the bridge where the casualties had been heavy on both sides.
[00:18:14] The Germans having already lost two thousand men, although it was not clear who had counted
[00:18:19] them.
[00:18:23] Now as he gets done with that, he kind of gives some word.
[00:18:27] They're going to start moving down this track.
[00:18:30] So he's giving that order to this one of his officers, Doyle.
[00:18:35] Doyle's normally pretty fired up about what he's doing.
[00:18:40] He's a motivated guy.
[00:18:41] Here we go back to the book. Doyle was not at all his embellion self.
[00:18:46] The task of nine platoon was simple.
[00:18:48] He and his men had to walk straight down the track until they ran into the boge position.
[00:18:54] Their first warning of the enemy presence would be the rifle and machine gun fire tearing
[00:18:59] into them.
[00:19:01] Still less were the two scouts to be envied who would be moving out in front of the rest
[00:19:06] of the platoon.
[00:19:08] Who was almost inevitable that the first German rounds would hit one or both of them,
[00:19:14] unless the Germans were cunning enough to let them pass so as to kill more of the men
[00:19:19] behind.
[00:19:21] But without armor in front to draw the enemy fire and pinpoint their positions, there
[00:19:26] was no other way to advance.
[00:19:29] I had chosen Doyle to lead the advance because I was certain that I could rely on him.
[00:19:36] This was the penalty for being good at one's job.
[00:19:41] So there you go.
[00:19:43] They're actually walking down train tracks and they know 100% they know 100% that Germans
[00:19:50] are waiting for them and they're going to push down the strax and the way they're going
[00:19:54] to find the Germans is when the Germans start shooting at them.
[00:20:02] So they proceed down the tracks and now going back to the book, the expected happen.
[00:20:09] The calm of the night collapse in an explosion of light and noise.
[00:20:15] From a wide arc in front of nine platoon, streams of white red and yellow tracer bullets
[00:20:20] converged on the stretch of track where the men must have flung themselves to the ground.
[00:20:26] Every lights and parachute flares larger and brighter than anything carried by a swung down
[00:20:31] towards the earth, lighting the dark country shide to the shade of a gray November morning.
[00:20:38] A house burst into flames on the other side of the railway.
[00:20:42] It was too sudden for an accident.
[00:20:44] The configuration must have been planned.
[00:20:48] Anything which moved was now visible.
[00:20:51] Overall was the noise.
[00:20:54] The den of shells and mortars bursting both behind and ahead, merging with the harsh roar
[00:21:00] of the enemy spanned out light machine guns and the more sustained drumming of the heavier
[00:21:05] weapons.
[00:21:07] Now I could hear another sound.
[00:21:09] It was a slow rata tat of nine platoon's brain guns and the crack of British rifles
[00:21:14] were applying to the German fire.
[00:21:26] This is a well-planned ambush scenario.
[00:21:29] If you think about it, it sounds like they rigged this house to light up and be on fire
[00:21:35] and now that's backlighting and silhoueting all the friendly troops because it just makes
[00:21:41] you stand out because it's a fire behind you on top of that machine gun fire on top of
[00:21:46] that mortars shells are hitting you.
[00:21:52] Here we go back to the book as the major here as the company commander Jeffrey Powell is
[00:22:00] crouch down, waiting as all this is happening out ahead of him.
[00:22:04] He's not with that first platoon.
[00:22:06] He's behind them a little bit.
[00:22:08] Here we go back to the book, I saw a single crouched figure running up the track behind
[00:22:11] towards me.
[00:22:13] Then I recognize the broad bulk of Bartholomew, Leslie Doyle's platoon sergeant.
[00:22:20] This was quick, Leslie had wasted no timing sending back news.
[00:22:24] Only a little out of breath, sergeant Bartholomew sank down by my side and began to speak.
[00:22:30] His voice is calm and sensible as usual.
[00:22:34] His leading section had come under fire at a range of only some 20 or 30 yards.
[00:22:40] It appeared that the Germans had allowed the two scouts to pass unmolested but everyone
[00:22:44] else in the front section had been killed.
[00:22:48] There were several other casualties in the platoon as well including Mr. Doyle who had
[00:22:52] been hit badly in the thigh and was only semi-conscious.
[00:22:56] The survivors were pinned to the ground by fire which was coming from either side of the
[00:23:00] track.
[00:23:03] This was all wrong.
[00:23:06] With his platoon commander hit, sergeant Bartholomew, his place was with the platoon.
[00:23:12] There were plenty of other people to carry messages, not only that but Bartholomew could hardly
[00:23:16] have had time to verify the disastrous information about the leading section.
[00:23:21] It was far from likely that every man in it had been killed.
[00:23:27] So Bartholomew's nerve had broken in the first test.
[00:23:34] That's the situation.
[00:23:35] This guy ran and he comes back and reports in and says, hey everyone's dead and he realizes
[00:23:44] he realizes the company commander realizes that not true.
[00:23:49] Going back to the book perhaps the responsibility had been too much for him.
[00:23:52] However it was he was certainly scared despite his success in concealing the fact.
[00:23:58] The sergeant had run away leaving the platoon to its own devices.
[00:24:03] I was flabbergasted.
[00:24:05] Of all the NCOs I had judged this cool reserved man to be the most dependable.
[00:24:12] A hard taskmaster, too ruthless to be popular, sergeant Bartholomew had been an effective
[00:24:18] foiled to the easy going and friendly doil and the two men had formed a fine team.
[00:24:24] It was incredible that this should have happened.
[00:24:29] In the light of a flare I studied the sergeant's face there was nothing to be seen.
[00:24:34] Bartholomew returned my glaze with steady eyes.
[00:24:40] There could be no point in my further destroying the man's self-respect.
[00:24:44] It was possible that he might recover after this first shock.
[00:24:48] His pride taking charge to control his fear.
[00:24:53] So my review was restrained no more than a comment that Bartholomew should have sent private
[00:24:58] Jones back with the news and not come himself.
[00:25:02] Then I stood up once again, told Robert who had appeared by my side to take charge and
[00:25:06] started down the track toward the forward platoon, motioning Bartholomew to accompany me.
[00:25:12] There was no need to say anything to Harrison, who automatically rose to his feet.
[00:25:17] His stem cradled in his elbow ready to shoot.
[00:25:22] So interesting leadership dynamic there.
[00:25:25] Instead of saying, yo, you coward, you quit.
[00:25:28] He doesn't do that.
[00:25:29] Instead he really tones it back and says he should have said Jones instead.
[00:25:34] He's hoping that this guy will recover and this is a great line.
[00:25:38] It's pride taking charge to control his fear, meaning this guy just has no pride at this
[00:25:44] point.
[00:25:45] He's trying to keep it together.
[00:25:47] But hopefully the company commander is thinking that, okay, this guy will get it back
[00:25:55] together hopefully and will be able to utilize him as opposed to me just dropping the hammer
[00:25:59] on him right now in which case he might just completely break and be worthless.
[00:26:04] The other thing, I tried to include as much as I could of this guy, Harrison, that gets
[00:26:09] mentioned, who's sort of the the the company commander's right hand guy, but he's just
[00:26:15] always there, always ready, always stepping up and making things happen.
[00:26:26] Now eventually, as all that unfolds, we're going back to the book, Nez bit, which is one
[00:26:32] of the guys in that in that platoon.
[00:26:34] Nez bit had decided that it was time to leave and had used the wall to bring back the
[00:26:38] survivors of the platoon.
[00:26:40] Two men were dead while nothing was known of the fate of the two scouts.
[00:26:45] With Nez bit were five wounded men, two of whom including his officer were being carried.
[00:26:51] Leslie and shocking pain from a shattered thigh which Morphe had done little to help had
[00:26:57] fainted after a few yards and was still unconscious.
[00:27:01] A third of the platoon were casualties.
[00:27:03] It was bad, but not as quite as bad as pictured by our following you.
[00:27:08] I could not blame Nez bit for withdrawing without permission.
[00:27:12] Short of ammunition, with their officer wounded and the platoon sergeant unaccountably
[00:27:17] missing, the men had heard nothing of the troops behind them for the past hour and had
[00:27:21] concluded that the battalion must have pulled back.
[00:27:26] Nez bit had seen a lot of war as his DCM one in Crete testified.
[00:27:32] He understood its muddle.
[00:27:34] He knew it was rare for a battle to go as planned.
[00:27:39] His responsibility was to his men to rescue them from what seemed to be a mess.
[00:27:45] This he had done and his judgment had been correct.
[00:27:50] They were no place to be caught at daylight overlooked on a forward slope and unencumbered
[00:27:56] with wounded men.
[00:27:57] You see, decentralized command and action right there.
[00:28:00] Nez bit doesn't hear, doesn't know what's going on.
[00:28:02] He makes a decision.
[00:28:03] I'm getting these guys out of here.
[00:28:05] What's good is the company commander supports?
[00:28:07] Hey, he made a good call.
[00:28:09] That was the right thing to do.
[00:28:14] Now, at this point, they're moving back after they've confirmed, they pushed forward
[00:28:22] trying to find out where the Germans were and now they're moving back because they realize
[00:28:26] that the Germans are absolutely holding strong.
[00:28:29] They've done this push forward.
[00:28:30] They've got basically ambushed and now they pulled back after, like I said, confirming
[00:28:37] where the Germans were back to the book to accomplish this, meaning to accomplish finding
[00:28:43] out where the Germans were to accomplish this had cost us Leslie Doyle and the absent
[00:28:48] Barfall Mill, while two men and Doyle's leading section were dead and the two scouts were
[00:28:53] missing probably either killed or made prisoner.
[00:28:56] Seven other men had been wounded, including another sergeant.
[00:29:00] This is a total of 13 casualties with another nine men lost when we landed.
[00:29:06] With nothing at all accomplished, over 20 men had already been killed or injured and now the
[00:29:12] battalion was moving in the wrong direction back the way we had come.
[00:29:18] You're going to find them.
[00:29:21] What makes this story so devastating is that I talk about Murphy's Law and things go wrong.
[00:29:31] These guys are complete.
[00:29:32] It's just Murphy's Law over and over again.
[00:29:36] Most of the books that we read on here, there's triumph and there's victory at the end.
[00:29:42] And you can see right now already where this is heading.
[00:29:44] We got 20 guys wounded or killed and instead of moving forward, we're actually moving backward.
[00:29:54] Back to the book sooner than expected, we reached the battalion base.
[00:29:57] It had been sighted in an rectangular patch of wood about 20 acres inside lying just north
[00:30:03] of the railway.
[00:30:06] It was 230 AM, a horrible hour, especially so if one is time.
[00:30:12] I heard cold and hungry.
[00:30:15] Thank God it would be starting to get light in a couple of hours.
[00:30:19] What would happen tomorrow?
[00:30:22] Something had gone very wrong indeed.
[00:30:25] By now we should be dug in on the high ground north of our NEM, waiting for the Germans
[00:30:30] to counter attack the bridges instead.
[00:30:33] We were sitting here in the woods only a few miles from where we had dropped with strong
[00:30:38] enemy forces between ourselves and the city where the men of first brigade must be fighting
[00:30:43] for their lives.
[00:30:45] Wherever one turned they're seem to be German troops and good ones at that.
[00:30:50] The men who had stopped us had not behaved like rear area troops scraped together to put
[00:30:55] up some sort of resistance, but it fought with skill and tenacity.
[00:31:01] The slit trenches were dug and everyone except for the double centuries in each section
[00:31:05] and the officers and NCOs on duty was sound asleep.
[00:31:09] The men humped like dogs, some curled up with a companion for warmth, lying in their full
[00:31:15] equipment, their weapons tied to their wrists by the slings.
[00:31:20] I should be asleep too.
[00:31:22] Not sitting and worrying, feeling sorry for myself, but trying to get some rest and preparation
[00:31:27] for the coming day.
[00:31:31] Then to would be at 0, 4, 30 hours, half an hour before first light, when everyone would
[00:31:37] be awake and ready in this slit weapon poised for a possible dawn attack.
[00:31:48] So they're dug in and of course it's not looking good at this point.
[00:31:54] They're going to stand to it 0, 4, 30 which is pretty common.
[00:31:57] You're going to be up before the sun rise and you want to be up before the enemy as well.
[00:32:05] Now they get together and get some word.
[00:32:08] Here we go back to the book.
[00:32:09] It did not take long.
[00:32:10] It did not take the kernel long to give us our orders.
[00:32:13] The brigade was to renew its effort to reach the bridge and bring relief to the men still
[00:32:16] fighting there.
[00:32:17] So pretty simple straight forward goal.
[00:32:24] And in order to achieve this goal, they set up to do an attack on this little section
[00:32:30] of woods where they think there's a bunch of Germans and here we go back to the book.
[00:32:34] The leading sections plunged into the wood and disappeared.
[00:32:38] There were no enemy there at all.
[00:32:41] The information from brigade must have been wrong.
[00:32:43] We had attacked and taken an empty position.
[00:32:47] Never was there such an anti-climax, but never was an anti-climax.
[00:32:52] Now we get a little visit up on the front lines.
[00:33:00] Here we go back to the book.
[00:33:02] As the small spare figure stepped out of the first vehicle, I realized that it was the
[00:33:06] first time I had seen the Brigadier commander since we left England.
[00:33:11] He was just the same as ever, relaxed and smiling.
[00:33:15] Battle was nothing new to him.
[00:33:17] He had been through the worst of the desert war.
[00:33:20] Battle in no way disconcerted him at least not outwardly.
[00:33:25] It's interesting he uses the term model.
[00:33:28] He's talking about the fog of war.
[00:33:29] This model, when you don't really know what's happening, he talks about how the veterans
[00:33:32] are used to it and accustomed to it and they can deal with it.
[00:33:36] Model in no way disconcerted him at least not outwardly.
[00:33:40] He seemed to anticipate it, understanding how judgment and behavior was impaired by danger.
[00:33:47] Wherever he went, he inspired confidence with his gentle eyes in friendly manner.
[00:33:52] For regular cavalry officer, his background was unusual.
[00:33:56] He'd come to his regiment not from sandhurst, but from Oxford, with a double first and
[00:34:02] fluency in a half a dozen languages.
[00:34:06] And I love this line right here.
[00:34:07] He wore his learning light-need lightly as he did his decorations.
[00:34:13] This guy is highly educated and highly decorated, but you don't even know it.
[00:34:18] It was rare for soldiers to be aware of officers more senior than the kernels who commanded
[00:34:22] their battalions.
[00:34:24] But every man in the brigade would recognize, could recognize and name the brigadier.
[00:34:29] The two visitors did not stay long, but their appearance was atomic for all.
[00:34:33] It was a reminder that there were able men in charge, even though the battle was developing
[00:34:40] in a rather odd manner.
[00:34:46] Now as he continues in these situations, back to the book, suddenly my preoccupation, my
[00:34:53] preoccupation with the problems of others ceased.
[00:34:57] There was a familiar wine overhead, and I found myself propelled into the half-dog trench,
[00:35:02] all but on top of gall-braith and robber.
[00:35:05] The action had been a reflex.
[00:35:07] I knew that I had made no conscious decision to jump.
[00:35:11] As I lay there with my second in commands and trenching tool, carving into a ridge in my
[00:35:15] left buttock, the mortar bomb burst about eight feet to the right.
[00:35:20] The scream of the shards of jagged metal passing just overhead flailed my ears as earth
[00:35:25] and stones spattered down on top of us.
[00:35:29] The stench of high explosive filled my field the trench.
[00:35:34] My face I found was pressed into the coarse material of corporal gall-braith's battle
[00:35:38] trousers.
[00:35:40] Gingerly raising my head I peered over the low parapet.
[00:35:43] At the foot of the of a tree some 15 yards away lay a motionless heap, a green and
[00:35:49] khaki bundle which did not stir.
[00:35:53] Jumping out of the trench I ran across and turned over the limp body.
[00:35:57] The head fell back to show the open staring eyes of sergeant Hawks, one of the seven
[00:36:02] platoon section commanders, a bright young A.N.C.O. only just promoted who'd been with the
[00:36:08] battalion since the day it was raised.
[00:36:12] He was another old friend.
[00:36:14] At first I could see no sign of injury but then I noticed the small hole in the back of Hawks
[00:36:19] helmet and the thin stream of blood streaking the back of his neck.
[00:36:25] Lying by hugging side I seemed to count seven explosions all just a little further away
[00:36:30] than the first but still close enough to smell the hot gases.
[00:36:35] There was a short pause and then as if it were not afterthought an eighth bomb struck the branches
[00:36:40] of the tree just above us directing its hot metal splinters down to the trenches below.
[00:36:46] A half strangled, his cry of distress brought my head up just in time to see corporal
[00:36:51] preacher clamber out of his slit and reach across the towards the cry.
[00:36:56] His haversac of medical supplies marked with its red cross dangling from his hand.
[00:37:01] The pause lasted no more than a half a minute.
[00:37:04] Again the wine.
[00:37:05] Again I ducked.
[00:37:06] This was the covering fire for a counter attack or the was this the covering fire for
[00:37:11] a counter attack or were the boge merely harassing us spitefully.
[00:37:17] But when I raised my head from Higgins from Higgins boots to look around I was relieved
[00:37:21] to see one of the seven platoon brain gunners his helmet and eyes just above the level of
[00:37:26] the parapet gazing down the track towards his front.
[00:37:30] So the centuries were still doing their job.
[00:37:33] The fire was not forcing their heads down.
[00:37:36] If this was the covering fire for an attack we would not be caught on a wares.
[00:37:44] So that's the standard procedure right here for the Germans and really for anyone.
[00:37:48] It's covering move right.
[00:37:49] We put in big bonds we put in mortars we put our in artillery and while you're hiding
[00:37:53] and while you're ducking down so you don't get killed they maneuver in and then right
[00:37:58] it right when they get so close that they're in danger of their own artillery the artillery
[00:38:03] stops and then they proceed with the assault.
[00:38:06] Here we go.
[00:38:07] The low now there's a low the low provided a chance to finish digging.
[00:38:11] There was no longer any need to persuade the men to dig faster the lesson had really been
[00:38:15] driven home.
[00:38:17] We've been digging for no more than a few minutes when the sound of firing to the north
[00:38:20] slack and but the noise from the vehicles in front had increased the thought of guns
[00:38:26] only a few hundred yards away was punctuated by the hammering of brands.
[00:38:31] By the way, brands I don't think I've said this brands are sort of the weapon of British
[00:38:35] machine gun versus the the spanned out which is which is the German machine guns and
[00:38:42] the use the the brits in the Americans use the term spanned out to talk about basically
[00:38:48] heavy machine heavy your machine guns but but that's what they're talking about when
[00:38:54] they're talking about spanned out and then a brand is the Brit machine gun.
[00:38:59] Both Ford Patoons were in action and I had placed company headquarters too far back
[00:39:05] to be able to see what was happening.
[00:39:08] The walkie talkies were silent also I worried about the sitting of the cartoon some
[00:39:13] 300 yards apart each isolated in its own corner of the woods and unable to support the
[00:39:19] others against a determined attack.
[00:39:23] This is so important for tactical leaders out there think about these lessons and these are
[00:39:29] lessons that I talk about all the time and these are lessons that I used to have to teach
[00:39:33] all the time.
[00:39:34] So you've got your platoon's they're out there doing something.
[00:39:38] You need to be close enough that you have communications with them so that you actually
[00:39:42] understand what's happening and this is the same in the business work.
[00:39:44] If you put yourself in a position where you can't I will you don't understand what's
[00:39:48] happening in the field then you're not going to be able to help you're not going to
[00:39:52] be able to support you're not going to be able to to understand what's happening so you
[00:39:56] can make decisions.
[00:39:57] So in this point he's positioned himself too far away.
[00:40:01] On top of that he's positioned his platoon's too far apart from each other.
[00:40:08] So if you're too far apart from each other you can't cover for each other if you can't
[00:40:13] cover you can't move and if you can't move you can't win.
[00:40:17] So those are critical points.
[00:40:20] Make sure your command position is close enough not so close that you're getting in the
[00:40:25] fire fight note not so close that you're pin down but close enough so that you understand
[00:40:29] what is happening.
[00:40:31] And then if you have multiple elements in the field you get them close enough to each
[00:40:35] other that they can support each other.
[00:40:39] Always.
[00:40:43] He sees a guy running back and here we go back to the book it was Sergeant Prior one
[00:40:47] of Nezbitt's section commanders a rather sulky man able and well educated but with a
[00:40:51] grudge against authority.
[00:40:52] And his left hand prior grasp is stend in a grip so firm that the knuckle is showed
[00:40:58] blue under the sunburn.
[00:41:00] His right arm from which clothing had been cut away at the shoulder was thrust into the
[00:41:05] front of his smock.
[00:41:06] The elbow covered by a bloodstained dressing.
[00:41:10] His face was white with shock and taught with pain.
[00:41:14] A morphe injection was doing little to alleviate the agony of an elbow smashed by a bullet.
[00:41:21] The news prior brought was serious.
[00:41:23] The vehicles which we could hear were booch armor.
[00:41:28] Moving backwards and forward along the road and sweeping the front of nine platoon's position
[00:41:33] secure from retaliation.
[00:41:36] So far the armor had only claimed prior but Sergeant Avondale had been killed by a
[00:41:41] mortar fragment as he dashed across between a couple of trees to put some question to
[00:41:46] Nezbitt.
[00:41:48] This inexorable loss of skilled leaders was serious.
[00:41:53] In our parachute battalions unlike usual infantry units, section leaders ranked as sergeants
[00:41:58] not corpals.
[00:42:00] Nine platoon had now lost not only its officer but three of its four sergeants as well.
[00:42:07] Hawks was dead and one of seven platoon's section commanders had failed to appear at the
[00:42:11] rendezvous after the drop.
[00:42:14] Already nearly half the sergeants had become casualties.
[00:42:25] This is just a nightmare unfolding.
[00:42:33] Back to the book after we'd put the final touches on our slit trenches, time was found
[00:42:37] to scrape a shallow grave for sergeant Hawks.
[00:42:41] It was hard to suppress one's revoltsh in touching the body of someone I had known so
[00:42:45] well but just as I was stealing myself to do so, Huggin stepped forward, ripped open the
[00:42:51] dead man's smock and shirt and slipped one of the two identity discs over the blood
[00:42:56] stained head.
[00:42:59] The sergeant major then unbuckled his watch and searched the pockets for anything which
[00:43:03] might be useful, a morphiest syringe and a field dressing, a bar of chocolate and a couple
[00:43:09] of mills grenades, two packets of cigarettes and a box of matches, a couple of maps and
[00:43:14] a pocket knife.
[00:43:16] There was nothing personal except for a grubby envelope containing a half a dozen faded
[00:43:21] and dog-yared snapshots of the stout smiling girl holding a baby.
[00:43:27] Before buttoning the envelope into his breast pocket, Huggin slipped the identity disc
[00:43:32] between the photographs.
[00:43:35] I was helping Corporal Prychard shoveled the earth back over Hawks' body, listening with
[00:43:39] one ear to Huggin, sharing the dead man's ammunition and other possessions among the members
[00:43:44] of the company headquarters.
[00:43:45] When suddenly I became aware of Jimmy Gray standing beside me apparently anxious to speak
[00:43:51] but different, at interrupting.
[00:43:55] Telling Prychard to finish the job, I rose from my knees, glad to be able to put my mind
[00:43:59] to something else.
[00:44:02] When I turned to speak to Gray, I was disturbed by what I saw.
[00:44:07] The dirt of battle had exaggerated his usual scruffiness.
[00:44:12] His smock and trousers were coated with mud and dust and his right sleeve was stained
[00:44:17] from top to bottom with blood.
[00:44:19] Not his own, as he explained when he saw my eyes fixed on it.
[00:44:24] The front of his smock and the battle dress under it, neath had been torn by a large fragment
[00:44:29] of a mortar bomb.
[00:44:31] He had reached in some miraculous fashion and failed to even scratch him.
[00:44:35] Three inches to one side and it would have been set and it would have severed his head.
[00:44:41] But it was the eyes above the pallid unshaving cheeks which were frightening.
[00:44:48] They were empty of life.
[00:44:51] When he spoke, the words were loosed and well-chosen as ever, but the voice lacked expression.
[00:44:58] The phrases were cold.
[00:45:00] He was not as if he were describing events which he had himself witnessed, but something
[00:45:04] unreal, something half imagined.
[00:45:09] Be companyated attacked at 0800 hours.
[00:45:13] At the start, their advance through the woods had gone like the first attack of the morning
[00:45:17] a calm and steady progress against a seemingly non-existent enemy.
[00:45:22] Then some hundred yards short of the objective, a swath of fire had cut down the men
[00:45:27] of the two leading pletoons.
[00:45:30] The half-grown trees and the sparse undergrowth had neither hidden them nor shielded them
[00:45:35] from the inner locking arcs of the enemy weapons which covered every inch of ground.
[00:45:42] It was just possible that they might have been able to deal with the machine guns alone,
[00:45:47] but the armor was too much for them.
[00:45:49] Pumping shells into the men at near point blank range.
[00:45:55] Gray had seen it all happen.
[00:45:58] The Colonel had tried to stop the attack as soon as the full strength of the enemy position
[00:46:02] had become clear, but by then more than half the men of the two leading pletoons had
[00:46:08] been killed or wounded.
[00:46:11] Both sub-alterns were dead.
[00:46:13] The other officers and the CSM had all been wounded.
[00:46:20] The Colonel had tried to turn the German flank by sending a company around to the left,
[00:46:25] but there was no flank.
[00:46:27] The second attack had been a replica of the first.
[00:46:31] It too had collapsed, but not before some 40 more men were dead or maimed, including
[00:46:36] two of the four surviving officers.
[00:46:41] Harry Bates had been terribly wounded in the stomach and by now was probably dead.
[00:46:48] As Gray had pulled him behind some cover, his blood had soaked his sleeve.
[00:46:55] This was not the complete story.
[00:46:57] There was further bad news.
[00:47:00] Not only had our own attack been shattered, but the other battalion to our north had
[00:47:05] hit similar enemy positions and was making little progress in its efforts to get into
[00:47:11] our name along the main road.
[00:47:15] From somewhere or other, the boat should found enough troops of quality good enough to
[00:47:20] smash the brigade's attempt to reach the city.
[00:47:29] So we deserve a horrible situation unfolding.
[00:47:39] Back to the book, from far away in the distance came the drum of powerful airplane engines.
[00:47:45] As it was the first to spot the minute shapes, first circling and then diving out of the sun
[00:47:50] towards us, the noise changing to a shriek as the machine swept down towards the wood towards
[00:47:55] the woods.
[00:47:57] From a half a dozen different directions, a happy shout of spit fires rose from the trenches.
[00:48:03] At last some help had arrived from the outside world.
[00:48:07] The RAF had arrived to give us closer support.
[00:48:11] And that's, you know, we've had closer support saved the day many times in books that
[00:48:17] we've talked about on this podcast.
[00:48:21] As I gave up at the dozen spit screaming down to strafe the boat's positions on the
[00:48:26] sloping ridge head, Nesbitz voiced suddenly roared in my ear, shouting to everyone to
[00:48:31] get their heads down and hide their faces.
[00:48:35] As I ducked with the rest, I spotted the black crosses on the wings.
[00:48:41] The aircraft were not ours, but German mesher schmits.
[00:48:45] Our air superiority was so overwhelming that it never occurred to anyone that the machines
[00:48:51] might be hostile.
[00:48:54] They were not diving onto the enemy positions, but on to our own.
[00:49:00] I gazed, skywards, the mesher schmits was so close that I could see the pilots face.
[00:49:06] Two rockets detached themselves from the wings and swooped down to explode seconds later
[00:49:11] in the woods where the survivors of A and B companies were settling into their new positions.
[00:49:17] As I ducked once more, there was another scream of engines from behind, followed by the
[00:49:21] sound of a storm of bullets striking branches on the trees and the other side.
[00:49:26] Two aircraft which had discharged their rockets were now carrying out a second run strafing
[00:49:32] with their machine guns.
[00:49:34] As I squeezed even closer to the earth at the bottom of the shallow trench, the reverberations
[00:49:38] of an explosion, some 50 yards of waves, pounded my ear drums.
[00:49:43] It was another rocket.
[00:49:46] Suddenly it ended.
[00:49:48] The aircraft had vanished as quickly as they had arrived.
[00:49:54] Wow.
[00:49:55] Yeah, because at this point, the British and the Americans had almost total air domination,
[00:50:01] so everyone just completely assumed that of thank God here comes some Spitfires to
[00:50:05] come and save us and they were wrong.
[00:50:13] Now the air, we did have air domination for the most part and one of the things that they
[00:50:21] needed as you heard these airborne troops, they can only carry so much and so they're
[00:50:26] going to need resupplies.
[00:50:27] They need more ammunition.
[00:50:28] They need medical gear.
[00:50:29] They need water.
[00:50:31] They need stuff to be dropped to them.
[00:50:33] And so there was a plan in place for them to have gear and food and equipment and ammunition
[00:50:41] dropped to them at these locations where they were supposed to be.
[00:50:47] Because remember they were supposed to be making progress this whole time.
[00:50:49] They're not making progress, but they're supposed to be making progress.
[00:50:52] And since communication is so bad, they can't call back and say, hey, we're not we're
[00:50:57] supposed to be we're over here, drop the gear on us.
[00:51:02] But the gear gets dropped in the pre planned positions, which of course are enemy positions.
[00:51:10] But here's what it sounds like for them, or here's what they're thinking on the ground.
[00:51:15] Then to the south of us, I saw the familiar shape of a line of Dakota's approaching at about
[00:51:18] a thousand feet in a minute.
[00:51:20] The sky was crammed with them.
[00:51:22] Who's the first supply drop about which we had been told that the briefings, but the
[00:51:27] drop zone is a couple miles away over the other side of the hill right in the middle of
[00:51:32] enemy positions.
[00:51:35] By now, of course, the division should have captured the area, but the boat still held
[00:51:39] it.
[00:51:41] News of the progress of the battle could not have reached the RAF where the pilots would
[00:51:45] have diverted to drop their supplies elsewhere.
[00:51:51] Now, they can see this happening.
[00:51:55] And the people that are in the planes, they're called the RASC, the Royal Army Service
[00:52:02] Corps.
[00:52:03] They run basically the supply and the logistics and help re-supply and drop this equipment.
[00:52:11] So this is, he's as he's watching all these Dakotas, the Dakotas are these little transport
[00:52:17] planes.
[00:52:18] They had parachuted out of and now they're watching them drop this resupply.
[00:52:24] Back to the book, among the mass, a single Dakota just overhead caught my attention.
[00:52:30] It had already been hit and flames were creeping down from the starboard engine toward the
[00:52:35] cockpit.
[00:52:37] As it lost height, the khaki-clad RASC dispatchers were standing at the open doorway, pushing
[00:52:45] out the paniers of supplies, those of the bags of supplies.
[00:52:50] I could see their faces.
[00:52:53] The fire was on their side of the plane, the wing was burning before their eyes.
[00:52:59] The Dakotas was now little more than 300 feet above the ground.
[00:53:04] If the men at the door jump now, they might just save themselves.
[00:53:08] In a second or two more, the aircraft would be so low that their parachutes would not
[00:53:13] have time to open.
[00:53:17] This the men must have known, but they went on with their routine drill, pushing out the
[00:53:23] paniers regardless of what would happen to them.
[00:53:29] Then the starboard wing crumpled.
[00:53:31] The flaming plane disappeared beyond the trees, the paniers still falling from the open door.
[00:53:39] The sky was empty.
[00:53:42] The last plane had gone, but we still stood watching the place where the Dakotas had vanished,
[00:53:49] mourning the futility of the self-sacrifice we had just witnessed.
[00:54:01] Can't even imagine that.
[00:54:07] The sky is just continuing to do their job, knowing their fate.
[00:54:15] At their senior officers at this point, and their NCOs are starting to get hit pretty
[00:54:23] regular to be by snipers.
[00:54:27] So he decides to tell us his guys, hey, take your rank off your uniform, because I don't
[00:54:34] want the enemy to know, and he tells us to one of his leaders name Robert.
[00:54:41] And he says, as I watched, Robert slipped his captain stars off his shoulders and tucked
[00:54:45] them away in his pocket.
[00:54:47] I knew for certain that my second in command disapproved officers should show themselves
[00:54:53] as such.
[00:54:55] So one of his guys is thinking, no, we're officers.
[00:54:59] We need to stand out.
[00:55:05] I mentioned the American forces, the 80s, and the British forces, there was also a Polish
[00:55:15] parachute brigade that was coming in on this attack as well.
[00:55:20] And they were scheduled to come in a little bit later as reinforcements.
[00:55:25] And here we go, back to the Beckl book.
[00:55:27] Only then did I remember that the glider-born part of the Polish parachute brigade was
[00:55:31] due to land that afternoon upon the stretch of enemy, upon the stretch of open country
[00:55:36] below us, at the same time as the parachute battalions were dropped in the Polterland, south
[00:55:41] of Arnheim bridges.
[00:55:44] The landing zone was already a battlefield, and the wretched poles were about to land in the
[00:55:48] middle of it.
[00:55:50] First the gliders hit the ground.
[00:55:52] This massive weight tearing up chunks of stubbles that skated to a halt, lurking onto one
[00:55:57] wing as it did so.
[00:55:59] Men jumped out and rushed to the rear and released the tail unit so that the vehicles
[00:56:03] inside could be driven out.
[00:56:05] Two more gliders were now plowing across the ground.
[00:56:08] Another exploded in the air and a vast ball of yellow flame just as it was upon the
[00:56:11] point of touching down.
[00:56:13] Mortar bombs were bursting among the men struggling to release their loads while streams of
[00:56:18] chased tracer bysected the scene into oddly formal patterns.
[00:56:23] Another glider was on fire on the ground as still more swooped into land, adding to the
[00:56:29] chaos.
[00:56:30] The poles were now joining in the battle themselves, some firing toward the Germans,
[00:56:35] some towards the KOSB, which is a, the King's own Scottish borders.
[00:56:40] It's another British unit.
[00:56:43] This is some in the direction of our other battalion.
[00:56:47] It must be impossible for the poles to distinguish enemy from friend.
[00:56:51] They probably thought they had landed in a circle of both units all intent upon their
[00:56:55] destruction.
[00:56:57] In a few minutes it was all over, from the wrecked and flaming gliders which now littered
[00:57:01] the ground, small parties of poles were making their escape firing at anything they saw
[00:57:06] move.
[00:57:07] Two or three vehicles have been driven away but otherwise they had failed to drag their
[00:57:11] jeeps and guns from the gliders.
[00:57:13] The Polish anti-tank battery no longer existed as a fighting unit.
[00:57:18] It landed in the middle of a battle and been destroyed before it could fire a single shot.
[00:57:24] Waste!
[00:57:25] It was waste once again, waste like the supply drop, nothing seemed to go right.
[00:57:32] A knot of some eight poles charged towards us intent on seeking shelter either in the woods
[00:57:37] or behind the safety of a railway embankment.
[00:57:40] On thirty yards away one man slightly ahead of the other's must have noticed our camouflage
[00:57:44] steel helmets in the slit trenches ahead and shouted a warning.
[00:57:49] In a bunch they flung themselves into the undergrowth.
[00:57:53] Anticipating what would happen, I yelled to everyone to get their heads down just as a
[00:57:57] hail of bullets from the poles whistle over our heads, a few hitting the trench pair of
[00:58:01] pits but most striking the trees well above our heads as the excited men emptied their
[00:58:05] weapons in our direction.
[00:58:08] So long as we kept our heads down we were safe from the Polish fire but the worry was that
[00:58:11] some of them might creep closer and start to fling grenades around.
[00:58:17] However in a couple of minutes the firing slackened and then ceased.
[00:58:22] Possibly the poles since that something might be wrong when no one retaliated.
[00:58:26] The comparative silence provided the opportunity to shout a warning across the narrow
[00:58:30] stretch of ground which separated us.
[00:58:34] The crew is no reply and I shouted once again in faltering English a voice inquired
[00:58:38] who we were.
[00:58:40] Firmly the company sergeant major Huggins told them the poles seem to understand after
[00:58:46] a few seconds of audible consultation they rose through their feet and walked across.
[00:58:53] So you got a just a chaotic situation.
[00:58:57] The poles land they're getting attacked from all directions and sure enough they're shooting
[00:59:00] at the friendly forces blue on blue happening.
[00:59:05] Once he gets them settled down he's got some people.
[00:59:08] Some of these Polish folks that now have no leadership back to the but calling Douglas
[00:59:12] over I told him they need now had a fourth section in seven puttune and within a few minutes
[00:59:16] the poles were digging hard under the two to the edge of their corpal the only comprehensible
[00:59:20] part of whose name sounded like Peter.
[00:59:25] The digging had hardly started when a Jeep roared down the track in the direction from
[00:59:29] the direction of the battalion headquarters.
[00:59:32] As it break to stop and the cover of the trees Jimmy Gret jumped out and ran towards us.
[00:59:37] Gret's news was startling we were all to withdraw to wolf haze in 15 minutes time.
[00:59:46] One could not just stand up and walk away from an enemy right on one's heels.
[00:59:51] In daylight the only way to withdraw was to move by bounds with platoons and companies covering
[00:59:57] one another back.
[00:59:59] The other plan was madness things over in the north must be bad indeed for the kernel
[01:00:03] to be rushed in this way but grazing instructions were unshakable.
[01:00:07] So they're digging in they're getting ordered get out of here we're going to leave and
[01:00:11] he's saying okay that's fine but guess what even when you leave you still use the
[01:00:14] fundamental principle of cover move and that's what he's wanting to do.
[01:00:18] So now they're on the retreat and here we go back to the book the pace was far too
[01:00:24] quick some men were all but running to keep up.
[01:00:28] As I had expected little by little cohesion was starting to break down some of the men of
[01:00:32] the mortar platoon had overtaken us despite the weight of the loads and were mixed in
[01:00:36] among us.
[01:00:37] There were two small groups from another unit in the middle of seven platoon from somewhere
[01:00:41] in the front along way off a spandal spent sent its bullets flying harmless the overhead
[01:00:46] but men were looking apprehensive and flinching.
[01:00:50] We were now under fire from two different directions and any men at the bush would find
[01:00:54] the range and then the slaughter would begin.
[01:00:57] Who is no longer an orderly retreat that would draw is taking on the nature of a
[01:01:02] horde of men seeking safety.
[01:01:05] Soon discipline would crack and everyone would start to run.
[01:01:09] What a target we must be some 500 men from four to five different units rapidly coalescing
[01:01:16] into a solid moving mass.
[01:01:18] Yeah this is just a nightmare and you can imagine it's an individual thing and you're
[01:01:24] going to see some great leadership examples but it's an individual thing because
[01:01:27] if you can keep the teams working together covering and moving for each other that's good
[01:01:34] you're going to keep the enemies heads down but if people in the group start saying you
[01:01:38] know what I'm not going to cover I'm going to run and now no one's covering and now
[01:01:43] you've got a bunch of people that are moving and no cover and that's when you're going
[01:01:46] to get slaughtered not only get slaughtered by people that are shooting at you but if
[01:01:52] you're not putting down cover fire the enemy maneuvers they don't just sit there
[01:01:56] I mean some of them will be shooting but they'll be shooting but other elements of them
[01:01:59] are going to move and they're going to be able to cut you off.
[01:02:04] They finally do make it back and I get a little bit of luck here.
[01:02:08] Here we go back to the book we caught our breath in the wood so they get to a woods.
[01:02:12] David's men had disappeared and there was no sign of the Colonel or the battalion headquarters.
[01:02:17] No one had followed us.
[01:02:18] We were the last across but a quick check told me that only Robert Watson the CSM and
[01:02:23] three or four other men were missing in addition to seven but soon.
[01:02:27] Of the latter there was nothing to be seen and all there were still about 50 men with
[01:02:31] me not counting Peter and his seven poles still clinging to naciously to us.
[01:02:37] Perhaps I should try to get back across the bullet spattered embankment to find out what
[01:02:42] it happened to the others but the noise of the battle was getting louder.
[01:02:48] The boat must be closing in.
[01:02:49] The vital thing must be to rejoin the rest of the battalion with the 50 men I still had
[01:02:54] and not to leave them in loop Tyler's charge while I returned on what could be a fool
[01:02:59] hearty errand.
[01:03:02] But it was difficult to avoid the thought that perhaps I was reluctant to climb back
[01:03:08] over the top of that embankment.
[01:03:11] So he does make it to this woods but he doesn't have everybody with him and he's questioning
[01:03:16] himself.
[01:03:17] Back over there and risk it or not and part of his part of his rationalizing you know
[01:03:23] I had the best thing to do is get back with the rest of the battalion but part of him
[01:03:26] is saying you're rationalizing this and you're just you're just not you're being
[01:03:30] a coward.
[01:03:32] But he does he proceeds on with the time he knows you're going to get killed if he goes
[01:03:35] over that he can hear the enemy coming.
[01:03:38] So back to the book 10 minutes later we found the remnants of the battalion.
[01:03:42] Half of a company the mortars and what was left of the machine guns were still missing
[01:03:48] as well as our own 7-platoon.
[01:03:50] More than one third of the men who had withdrawn from the woods had failed to cross the railway
[01:03:56] we were now down to no more than a couple of hundred men.
[01:04:03] So we're going we're down to a couple of hundred men from five or six hundred men in the
[01:04:09] battalion.
[01:04:10] Maybe even a little bit more maybe there might have been 700 men in the battalion.
[01:04:16] They get word once again.
[01:04:19] Here's what's going to happen tomorrow at first light the brigade would move on to
[01:04:22] Usterbeek to join the rest of the division.
[01:04:26] But unless ammunition together with Aaron artillery support was forthcoming the prospects
[01:04:31] were far from good.
[01:04:33] We were it seemed not opposed by a few third line troops elements of three SS Panzer
[01:04:41] divisions had been identified in the battle.
[01:04:44] The Germans seemed to have moved quickly or else something had gone wrong with the intelligence.
[01:04:49] It was not surprising that the days fighting had been so very bitter.
[01:04:53] So they're pointing out that they weren't going against you know third rate troops.
[01:04:56] They were going against SS Panzer divisions, the best of the German soldiers.
[01:05:03] And talking with Sergeant Major Bauer and Sergeant Nesbitt before I reached Tyler's
[01:05:11] platoon I had done my best to be as cheerful as possible but it was plain that the two
[01:05:16] NCOs realized that I was making the best of things.
[01:05:20] With Luke Tyler it was different.
[01:05:22] I could not insult him by trying to disguise our straits.
[01:05:28] I just told him the facts as I had received them from the Colonel possibly it was a mistake.
[01:05:34] Quite suddenly the failure of it all oppressed me.
[01:05:38] In less than 36 hours, two thirds of the battalion had gone.
[01:05:43] Fifteen rifle company officers had landed only two were left.
[01:05:49] Ten for certain had either been killed or wounded.
[01:05:53] The chances of surviving another day were small, fatigue and hunger had drained me.
[01:05:58] There was a need to unburden myself.
[01:06:01] Luke was junior in my rank but equal in years and in any case it was easier to confide
[01:06:06] in someone who was in many ways a stranger.
[01:06:11] Even as I spoke I was ashamed of this weakness.
[01:06:16] But there was no stopping.
[01:06:18] Quietly Luke gave me the reassurance I needed.
[01:06:22] The iron needed to sustain oneself through such a day was easily expended and I felt
[01:06:27] that I had perloined some of Luke's share.
[01:06:34] So he basically unloads to one of his guys or to another officer below him in rank.
[01:06:41] But what I think is interesting about this is he needed someone to talk to.
[01:06:48] He was holding it all inside and wasn't saying anything and trying to look positive.
[01:06:52] Even he's looking at his guys as he's telling them don't worry, Jens we're going to be
[01:06:54] okay.
[01:06:55] His guys are looking at him like, hey, no.
[01:06:57] We don't believe you.
[01:06:58] And so he has to, he feels the need to unload on someone and that's why I just think
[01:07:03] from my perspective.
[01:07:05] We always talk about relationships that you have on your team and for sure in your
[01:07:10] platoon or in your team it's really good to have someone that you can just kind of unload
[01:07:15] on that you know as professional enough to bolster you up without getting dragged down
[01:07:19] into your negativity.
[01:07:21] And a lot of times I've found if you have someone like that or maybe a couple people
[01:07:26] like that and your team that you can talk to will guess what?
[01:07:30] Sometimes they're going to be bolstering your attitude and sometimes you're going to
[01:07:34] be bolstering their attitude.
[01:07:36] And so you got to find someone like that that's in your team that you can say, man, this
[01:07:41] is this horrible, this is going wrong and someone's going to go, hey, you know, it's not
[01:07:45] that bad.
[01:07:46] We're going to get through it.
[01:07:47] And then two or three days later he might come into you and say, hey, this is a horrible
[01:07:49] situation.
[01:07:50] I can't believe this and you're going to say, no man, we're going to be all right.
[01:07:53] So I think it's important and that's again, we're building relationships, but that's
[01:07:57] one of the reasons we build relationships.
[01:08:02] They get into a hold-up position back to the book.
[01:08:05] On stand two rounds, I found the Polish trenches empty except for Peter, their corporal,
[01:08:10] crouched grimly behind his brain.
[01:08:13] The rest of the party had vanished in the early hours, sensing perhaps the data attached
[01:08:17] themselves to an unlucky unit.
[01:08:21] You're explained nothing, but his embarrassment was clear.
[01:08:24] It was both unfair and pointless to press him for details when either pride or sense of duty
[01:08:29] had kept him there to fight among strangers.
[01:08:34] The thought of what would have happened if the enemy had attacked from this direction
[01:08:37] against the position held by one solitary man was chilling.
[01:08:42] It was a mistake to trust strangers.
[01:08:46] I had learned yet another lesson, rely on only those you knew.
[01:08:54] Again, it's interesting how he sometimes backs off instead of pressing where your guys
[01:08:59] he knows is like, what point is that?
[01:09:01] When Bartholomew was running away, he didn't press him super hard.
[01:09:06] And you're going to get to a point where he does press people.
[01:09:09] But here he's deciding he's not going to do it.
[01:09:11] And the other interesting thing is here it says, I learned another lesson to rely, not
[01:09:15] to stress strangers, rely on only those you know.
[01:09:18] What you have to do in those situations is you have to put someone that you do trust
[01:09:23] in bed with these units that you don't know.
[01:09:27] If you were to take and he gave that section to one of his puttsoon commanders and said,
[01:09:32] hey, you got another section now, but maybe in bed one more guy or two more guys in there
[01:09:37] or split these guys up even more.
[01:09:38] So instead of seven and one big bulk, you put two or three there, two or three there,
[01:09:42] two or three there.
[01:09:43] And you can have better control over them.
[01:09:47] It's weird.
[01:09:48] There's this opportunity to desert though, and these guys took the opportunity.
[01:09:56] Now the fighting rages on and obviously I have to fast forward through some of it.
[01:10:05] And they eventually get into a little village, a little small village and they've taken
[01:10:11] down.
[01:10:12] And there's a lot of buildings.
[01:10:14] And here we go, there are these buildings back to the book we were in a mess.
[01:10:21] The boat was on the other side of the valley outnumbered and outgunned us.
[01:10:27] There was not the slightest hope of reaching the back of the breed line this way and
[01:10:31] to stay here on this forward slope was impossible.
[01:10:34] At this rate we would all be dead or wounded soon.
[01:10:40] Somehow I had to get the survivors back up the hill, but it was near, but it was a near,
[01:10:45] insuperable problem with the men scattered down among the houses, lawns and shrubberies
[01:10:50] shot at every time they moved.
[01:10:53] Someone called from the side of the house, as I turned and looked private Gregory darted
[01:10:57] across to throw himself down beside me.
[01:11:01] Under the dirt and two days scrub of beard, his face was grayish white.
[01:11:07] He seemed about to vomit.
[01:11:10] As Gregory stammered out, his platoon commander's name, I knew what had happened.
[01:11:16] Lieutenant Tyler was dead.
[01:11:20] It must have happened just after we parted.
[01:11:22] Luke had been killed on the steep garden path which led from the house down the road.
[01:11:27] He'd been hit by a sniper, killed outright by a bullet through the heart.
[01:11:31] We had a couple yards of the place where Gregory was lying.
[01:11:35] Possibly, Luke had been careless because he was still dazed, but he had to get back to
[01:11:39] his platoon and the path was his only route.
[01:11:42] So they had been together and they'd been hit by some kind of artillery in the house and
[01:11:48] it rattled them and then Luke had gone out to get back to his platoon and when he left
[01:11:53] he got shot by a sniper.
[01:11:56] Back to the book, this was how officers and NCOs were killed just doing their routine job.
[01:12:02] This was why casualties among the leaders were so high.
[01:12:05] All the time that they were moving about, checking here, encouraging their backwards and
[01:12:10] forwards.
[01:12:11] Now besides myself and only the quartermaster sergeant, bower and sergeant, whiner were
[01:12:19] left.
[01:12:21] All the rest of the officers and sergeants in the company had gone.
[01:12:26] One problem however had been solved, the remnants of Tyler's two forward sections had
[01:12:30] managed to extricate themselves without waiting for orders.
[01:12:35] Since last night, private Gregory had been in charge of one of the other sections, both
[01:12:39] the NCOs having been hit the day before.
[01:12:43] During that last mortar, stonk, a bomb and fallen right on top of the corpel who is commanding
[01:12:48] the other section, blowing him and his brain gunner have to pieces.
[01:12:53] Common sense had told the survivors to quit and there had been no one to stop them
[01:12:58] except Gregory, who for the moment was shaken by the sight of what had happened to his
[01:13:02] friends and who in any case lacked the authority to hold them there.
[01:13:07] No one else had been hit and scrambled back and the survivors were now sheltering in
[01:13:11] the house.
[01:13:22] Further in these houses and for the first time you're going to hear the company commander
[01:13:27] start to realize he's got people at the breaking point back to the book.
[01:13:32] The others were as uneasy as I was.
[01:13:35] For the first time I was unhappy about them.
[01:13:38] Until now they had endured the success of disasters but the events of the morning had
[01:13:43] tried them too far.
[01:13:46] It had been yesterday once again yet another failure, failure against an enemy who was far
[01:13:51] too strong for us.
[01:13:54] Men were looking jittery, some could be well near their breaking point.
[01:14:00] As I gaze down the slope trying to spot some activity among the bush, a movement to the
[01:14:04] right caught my eye.
[01:14:06] About 20 yards away two of Kelly's men were moving diagonally behind me, sheltered on the
[01:14:11] far side of the ridge.
[01:14:14] These are these are diserters.
[01:14:17] My shout made them hesitate and then stop after two or three more steps.
[01:14:22] For getting the enemy I stood up and strode down towards them.
[01:14:26] No explanation was necessary.
[01:14:28] The surly guilt on their faces was enough.
[01:14:32] Deliberately choosing words for effect, I cursed them in language rarely used by officers
[01:14:37] towards their shoulders.
[01:14:40] It was enough.
[01:14:42] The two men turned back towards their platoon.
[01:14:48] So like I said, sometimes they're dropping the hammer.
[01:14:52] These two guys are trying to deser and he drops the hammer on them and gets them back
[01:14:57] with their platoon.
[01:14:58] Back to the book and this mood the men would never stand up to an enemy attack.
[01:15:03] Even a mortar stunk could break them.
[01:15:06] I could see it happening.
[01:15:08] Each one or two men would slip away like the two I had just stopped and then a rush would
[01:15:12] follow.
[01:15:14] Something drastic had to be done.
[01:15:17] No more than the occasional rifle bullet was now coming over.
[01:15:20] In fact, no one had been hit since we took our positions along this ridge.
[01:15:24] It seemed safe enough.
[01:15:27] Standing up, I began to walk along the path towards the left of our position.
[01:15:33] For the first few steps I felt wretchedly vulnerable.
[01:15:37] But then an odd exorlation seized me.
[01:15:42] For the first few steps I felt wretchedly vulnerable.
[01:15:47] But then an odd exorlation seized me.
[01:15:50] Not too slowly and not too quickly.
[01:15:52] I strode deliberately toward the first group of men.
[01:15:56] Grating down at Lance Corporal Williams, I made some anept remark about it being the wrong
[01:16:00] place for a company clerk.
[01:16:04] If I were to be hit, it would happen anyway.
[01:16:08] Now seemed to be as good a time as ever.
[01:16:11] Stopping at each group of men, I checked their firing positions and made necessary changes.
[01:16:15] Then I was at the end of Kelly's line and I started back conscious that everyone was
[01:16:19] watching.
[01:16:20] There was a burst of machine gunfire.
[01:16:22] Well, why do of us, but I managed to avoid flinching at it?
[01:16:26] Suddenly, Sergeant Wee Winner's voice harsh with concern was yelling at me to get down,
[01:16:32] and landing angrily what I was playing at.
[01:16:36] The spell broke.
[01:16:37] I was grateful for the excuse to lower myself down beside him very relieved that it was over.
[01:16:43] The rage and winers face dissolved into an unacustomed grin.
[01:16:48] The corny, dramatic, were over, but they had served their purpose.
[01:16:52] The men had got a grip on themselves.
[01:16:55] So he basically stood up and walked around and talked to everyone and made himself visible
[01:17:03] and made himself appear to not be scared to get the guys heads back in the game until his
[01:17:09] sergeant, Weiner, yells at him and says, hey, dude, get down.
[01:17:14] When these guys are like the desert, what do they go?
[01:17:18] So they can head back towards towards the areas that have been secured.
[01:17:23] So as this beach edge, we landed D-Day, June 6th, this is now in September.
[01:17:29] So coalition forces or sort of allied forces had pushed into France.
[01:17:34] So if you could walk back, you could eventually get to friendly lines.
[01:17:38] Yeah.
[01:17:39] And that's what their plan was.
[01:17:40] And then what, when you get there, don't they know, hey, you deserted me?
[01:17:44] Well, you tell, you know, you say, oh, I got separated from my chiefs when I perished
[01:17:49] you today and I couldn't find my people or whatever you make up your lie.
[01:17:52] You deal with it later with the winder.
[01:17:55] Because right now you're thinking, I'm not going to make it.
[01:17:57] Yes, we want that.
[01:17:59] It was clear why nothing, we had heard nothing from battalion headquarters for the past
[01:18:05] two hours.
[01:18:06] Everyone else, the signalers, orderlies and clerks had been fighting for their own survival.
[01:18:11] The Germans were all around them and had been pressing them hard throughout the morning.
[01:18:15] So they're not getting any information about what's happening.
[01:18:21] This is interesting.
[01:18:23] He goes back to get, they end up with a little extra ammunition and he goes back to get
[01:18:27] some ammunition from the battalion.
[01:18:29] They have got it like stage in the battalion headquarters and as he's doing this, the
[01:18:35] ammunition was in a Jeep.
[01:18:37] And so he goes to the Jeep.
[01:18:39] He finds the Jeep and he's with one of his other guys and they're the regimental sergeant
[01:18:44] major is sitting basically on top of the Jeep on top of the ammunition.
[01:18:49] And he kind of is looking at the guy saying, hey, I'm here.
[01:18:55] I'm an officer.
[01:18:56] I got a platoon's out there and a company out there.
[01:18:58] I got to get the ammunition and he doesn't really move.
[01:19:00] He just kind of sits there.
[01:19:03] And so finally, here he was.
[01:19:07] But here the regimental sergeant major was in the middle of battle sitting on his
[01:19:11] arse and taking his ease while the company commander hunted for ammunition.
[01:19:16] Rangers are not in the habit of rebuking regimental sergeant majors, but this was too much.
[01:19:21] The tensions of the morning had snapped myself for restraint and in a couple of succinct
[01:19:25] sentences, I told the regimental sergeant major what I thought of him.
[01:19:32] Then the regimental sergeant major apologized, but he did not move.
[01:19:38] Without any trace of irony or annoyance in his voice, he quietly explained that he could
[01:19:42] not stand up because he had been shot through both legs.
[01:19:46] I had not noticed the airborne smock with which someone had covered his outstretched
[01:19:51] and bandaged legs.
[01:19:57] Think before you act.
[01:20:01] Now they're on their way.
[01:20:03] They're heading finally to this area of Usterbeek.
[01:20:07] They're on their patrol.
[01:20:08] And here we go.
[01:20:09] Back to the book, a spandail opening up ahead sent us all to the ground men diving for
[01:20:14] cover just a little too quickly.
[01:20:17] A moment later a second gun fired on us from the right, but it was the ominous rattle
[01:20:23] of the tracked vehicles which chilled.
[01:20:26] The first one, then another, then two more, quite close and in front, their engine clatter
[01:20:32] rising above the den of the machine gun and rifles.
[01:20:35] Then some 70 yards away, I saw the first of the SP guns.
[01:20:40] It's stubby weeping traversing slowly towards us.
[01:20:44] They're kind of like tanks.
[01:20:46] It's self-propelled guns.
[01:20:47] They're like artillery pieces with tracks on them.
[01:20:52] The flash from its stout, from its snout was one of the explosion of the bursting shell.
[01:20:58] Just to the right, a half-grown tree shattered into jagged splinters, a second shot falling
[01:21:03] hard on the first one, covered Harrison and me with earth.
[01:21:07] We were swamped by the noise.
[01:21:09] Every sort of weapon seemed to be firing.
[01:21:11] Grenades were exploding, but the distinct above the rest was the clank and the throaty
[01:21:15] cough of the armored guns.
[01:21:18] Caught like this in the open, we were helpless.
[01:21:21] Tanks plowing among, about among us, could have been no worse.
[01:21:26] There was no way of fighting back, no one to seem to have even a peot, which is like their
[01:21:30] bazooka, anti-ironed weapon.
[01:21:32] And we could not get close enough to use the gammon bombs, the bags of plastic explosive.
[01:21:38] They're very for use against armor.
[01:21:40] So that's another little big bag of explosives that you can put on an armor vehicle to destroy.
[01:21:47] They call them gammon bombs.
[01:21:50] The men in front were moving again.
[01:21:52] I stood up and signal those behind.
[01:21:55] To follow.
[01:21:56] We were doubling now, but there was still some sort of control.
[01:21:58] We were not running away, but making for somewhere where I did not know.
[01:22:08] Then about a hundred yards away, I caught a glimpse through the trees of a German half-track.
[01:22:14] It stopped and helmeted shapes jumped from its sides.
[01:22:17] How many more of them were there?
[01:22:19] This could be the start of another attack, which could only end it all.
[01:22:24] Our will to fight back was all but broken.
[01:22:28] Then I heard the brigadier telling me to clear the enemy out of the hollow, after which
[01:22:34] the survivors of the brigade would join us there.
[01:22:37] The Z company it seemed was the last organized body of troops.
[01:22:42] They're looking at this area, this open area, whether it's some enemy, but it looks like
[01:22:46] it's a good position.
[01:22:48] Of course, their will to fight is just about broken.
[01:22:51] You hear the brigadier saying, hey, take your company and clear out that hollow.
[01:22:57] Go.
[01:22:59] Back to the book.
[01:23:00] For a moment, I was so dumbfounded that I hardly heard the brigadier going on to say
[01:23:04] that the brigade major was dead as well, killed about five minutes ago.
[01:23:08] Another friend was gone, but I hardly listened.
[01:23:11] What was the brigadier ordering us to do in his quiet and determined fashion?
[01:23:15] It was absurd.
[01:23:17] The men were finished, only a few minutes ago I had realized that they were past defending
[01:23:21] themselves.
[01:23:23] Now we were being told to assault that bogey position.
[01:23:27] The brigadiers look was both quizzicle and encouraging.
[01:23:32] The confounded man could see what was passing through my mind.
[01:23:36] Then I was away, dodging back and through the bushes towards the men in the ditch even
[01:23:41] more aware than ever before of the bullets singing overhead.
[01:23:46] With my back to a broad tree which hid me from the enemy front, I looked down at the
[01:23:49] upturn faces.
[01:23:51] There was no point in wasting at all in wasting time on details.
[01:23:58] The orders I had to give them were quite simple, devoid of any complications such as who
[01:24:02] would provide covering fire.
[01:24:04] It was time for play acting again.
[01:24:07] My naturally loud voice, carrying down the line of men among the above the sound of battles,
[01:24:12] I balled at them to follow me, adding the comment that is better to be killed going for
[01:24:17] the bastards than lying in that bloody ditch.
[01:24:22] No one hesitated.
[01:24:24] The men rose to their feet at the moment I stepped out in the open from behind the shelter
[01:24:28] of the tree.
[01:24:30] Clancing to my right I was exhilarated by the sight of David unwins solid bulk running parallel
[01:24:35] to me and half a dozen of his men following.
[01:24:39] David shouted something to the effect that they were coming as well and I waved my
[01:24:43] stand gun and acknowledgement.
[01:24:46] Behind me, Sergeant Wyner broke into a scream of rage, harsh and furious.
[01:24:52] The yellow spread down the line, too heavily laden and too tired to sprint, we lumbered
[01:24:58] forward towards the enemy in a sort of jogged trot.
[01:25:02] Now I was careless of everything.
[01:25:05] We did not stand a chance, but this was the right way to go.
[01:25:10] This was the proper way to finish it all.
[01:25:13] Nearly hysterical now with rage and excitement I heard my own voice join in the screaming.
[01:25:20] The Germans were shooting at us.
[01:25:21] I could see flashes of their weapons springing out of the gloom of the trees.
[01:25:25] There was no need to look back to confirm that the line of men was still following.
[01:25:29] The noise told me they were there.
[01:25:32] Now the boats were no more than 50 yards away.
[01:25:35] As I brought my stand down to hit level to press the trigger, it flashed through my mind
[01:25:39] that it was the first time I had fired my weapons since the battle started.
[01:25:43] My four fingers squeezed the metal.
[01:25:45] Nothing happened.
[01:25:46] It had jammed.
[01:25:48] Here I was running toward the enemy with a useless piece of metal in my hands.
[01:25:54] There were figures moving among the trees.
[01:25:56] First a couple, then a half dozen dark shapes were outlined against the green background.
[01:26:01] Men sprinting away, men disappearing through the trees.
[01:26:03] The boat were running away.
[01:26:06] We had done it.
[01:26:08] We had driven the enemy out at the point of bayonet.
[01:26:12] This was the ultimate in war.
[01:26:15] The sight of the savage, screaming, parachutes, streaming towards them.
[01:26:20] It had been too much for the Germans.
[01:26:22] Even though they had to do nothing more than keep their heads and shoot straight.
[01:26:32] Yeah.
[01:26:33] So there you go.
[01:26:35] Surrounded, broken.
[01:26:36] And I think key point here, when you're think you're broken, do something and do something
[01:26:43] aggressive.
[01:26:44] That's the, this is 100% de-falte aggressive.
[01:26:48] That's what this is.
[01:26:49] You know what?
[01:26:50] We're being defensive.
[01:26:51] We're hiding in our slit trenches.
[01:26:52] Okay, you know what we're going to do?
[01:26:54] We're going to attack.
[01:26:55] We're going to attack full force.
[01:26:57] Yeah.
[01:26:58] Back to the book, the sight of David on the right added to my delight.
[01:27:03] Shouting to him to hold the right of the hollow, I directed Sergeant Weiner round to the
[01:27:07] left.
[01:27:08] There was no need to tell anyone to hurry.
[01:27:10] They all knew that the Germans would not delay in mounting a counterattack.
[01:27:15] A moan of terror distracted me.
[01:27:17] I turned to the wounded German.
[01:27:19] The man's features were contorted into a rickness of despair.
[01:27:24] Above him stood Sergeant Major Kelly, red, eyed and panting, his band at raised above
[01:27:31] the soldier's stomach.
[01:27:34] But Kelly did not strike.
[01:27:35] He was relishing the moment, snatching maximum pleasure from the wounded man's anguish
[01:27:40] before he slifed it, sliced into the soft belly.
[01:27:45] As my newly found mouser knocked the bayonet to one side, the Sergeant Major snalled
[01:27:50] at me in an unspoken protest at such silly scruples.
[01:27:55] Then he seemed to shake himself.
[01:27:57] The blood lust has passed.
[01:27:59] Then he came to his senses, gathering his men to the defenses.
[01:28:05] So again, he could this guy go from the pure fury and rage of this incredible bayonet
[01:28:12] assault.
[01:28:13] And then he immediately just puts his one of his Sergeant Major's in check, who's about
[01:28:18] to, you know, rit ruthlessly killed this wounded guy.
[01:28:23] Very interesting dichotomy there.
[01:28:28] Back to the book, something had been snatched back from the disasters in the day.
[01:28:32] The remnants of the brigade headquarters together with a few stragglers from other units
[01:28:35] had now all arrived.
[01:28:37] In all there seemed to be about 150 men with a half a dozen officers, as well as the brigadier
[01:28:42] David and myself, there was Jimmy Gray.
[01:28:45] The latter brought news that the Colonel was probably dead, although he could not be sure
[01:28:50] as they'd become separated during a scrimmage within SP gun.
[01:28:55] Of the rest of the officers who had jumped with a battalion, Captain John Simmons, the
[01:29:00] gunner for an observer was the only left one left.
[01:29:12] Continuing, after about 15 minutes a low-enshooting suggested that I might now be able
[01:29:17] to get round to visit the Battalion positions.
[01:29:20] The Battalion, for the first time it struck me that I was now in command of what was left
[01:29:25] of it.
[01:29:26] The beautiful remnants, but they are still fighting.
[01:29:30] The brigadier had allotted the south and west sides of the perimeter to us.
[01:29:35] The first pit held sergeant whiner with seven or eight men.
[01:29:40] At the bottom his eyes shut, lay a gray face to motionless private Gregory, shot through
[01:29:45] his stomach.
[01:29:48] Corporal Pritured had bandaged him up and given a shot of Morphea, but because his airborne
[01:29:53] smock had been pulled down over his bloodstained dressing to keep his warmest possible, he
[01:29:57] laid there with no outward sign of injury, looking as a man might do who had collapsed
[01:30:02] with exhaustion.
[01:30:05] Gregory's eyes opened.
[01:30:07] When he saw who is standing over him, he asked for the favor.
[01:30:12] His voice was quiet, his words measured and coherent, his proposal quite logical.
[01:30:18] But here, without the help of a doctor, he was going to die in any case and he could
[01:30:24] stand the pain no longer.
[01:30:27] Which someone please put a bullet through his head.
[01:30:32] For the moment my grip tightened on the mouser.
[01:30:35] In Gregory's state, I probably would have been asking for the same release.
[01:30:41] If it did happen, I hope that someone would have the guts to give it to me.
[01:30:46] And I caught winers eye, and he knew that I could not do it.
[01:30:52] The only way to help Gregory was to give him a further shot of Morphea dangerous though
[01:30:57] it would be to do so.
[01:30:59] As I reach for my own ampule, in the breast pocket of my smock, I was ashamed by my reluctance.
[01:31:06] The reason was purely selfish.
[01:31:08] Sooner or later I might want to use it on myself wounded and alone behind a bush with
[01:31:12] no one about to help me.
[01:31:15] But Sergeant Winer came to the rescue.
[01:31:17] He had scrounge to couple a supply of ampules from somewhere or another.
[01:31:23] Opening the small black tin, he bared Gregory's arm and pressed the needle home.
[01:31:31] The words of sympathy and encouragement sounded pitifully trite, as I pressed Gregory's
[01:31:36] shoulder.
[01:31:39] Nervous of any reproach which I might see.
[01:31:42] I turned and walked away without looking at the wounded man's face.
[01:32:00] My name was being called.
[01:32:03] It was private Jones.
[01:32:05] Slythering towards me down the opposite slope of the hollowed Jones told me quickly.
[01:32:09] It was major unwinn, killed by a sniper.
[01:32:13] Shot through the forehead as he was peering over the rim of the hollow, trying to locate
[01:32:17] the wearabouts of a spando machine gun.
[01:32:21] He had died instantly.
[01:32:23] Jones was adamant there was no doubt that he was dead.
[01:32:26] His brain had been blown out.
[01:32:29] Jones was urging me to come see his body, but I could not bring myself to do so.
[01:32:36] They if it could not be dead.
[01:32:38] They could not have killed David.
[01:32:41] Everyone else, yes, one after another friends had died, but I never believed that this
[01:32:46] could happen in David so vast, so indestructible, the humorous, gentle David.
[01:32:55] The brigadier was beside me.
[01:32:58] He had also heard the news.
[01:33:01] More nearly two years, he had known us both and it was playing that he understood the anguish.
[01:33:09] But there were other things to think about.
[01:33:14] As we knew, only two well, the brigadier told us, our ammunition was nearly finished.
[01:33:19] And as our own fire slackened, the enemy snipers were becoming bolder and more men were
[01:33:24] being hit.
[01:33:26] Soon we would be forced to surrender, so we had decided to take the initiative.
[01:33:31] We would break out towards Usterbeek, charging through the enemy and solid mass, trusting
[01:33:36] our numbers and impetus to get through.
[01:33:41] It was an extraordinary plan.
[01:33:43] For the second time that day, the brigadier was ordering us to do what seemed impossible.
[01:33:50] But our trust in the brigadier's judgment was now implicit.
[01:33:53] It was a gamble, but one which offered at least a chance of success.
[01:33:58] The stay here would only win one way.
[01:34:04] 15 minutes later, we were ready.
[01:34:07] It could have been the start of a race.
[01:34:09] The brigadier asked whether we were ready, then at his shout, the hundred of us rose to
[01:34:13] our feet and exploded in a solid mass over the lip of the hollow.
[01:34:18] In front was the brigadier himself, leading the way.
[01:34:22] Behind came the yelling, screaming men, filthy and bloodstained, weapons in their hands,
[01:34:27] and that dull and menacing a fearful sight to anyone in our path.
[01:34:33] The German fire now seemed to be coming from every direction, but I saw no one hit.
[01:34:38] We were rushing downhill along a lane, a solid human battering ram.
[01:34:45] The first wild plate, paced, slacking the firing stopped.
[01:34:50] We had done it.
[01:34:52] We were through the enemy and out of the forest.
[01:34:55] We were the second time that day boldness had saved us.
[01:35:04] Once again, some default to aggressive activity.
[01:35:10] Obviously, I want to make it clear that both these situations, it wasn't a call of
[01:35:19] hey, there's a objective we want to reach, charge it.
[01:35:27] It can either sit here and do nothing and die or we can attack.
[01:35:33] That's the big, I don't want anyone out there thinking, okay, I'm just going to every
[01:35:37] time default the aggressive.
[01:35:38] I'm going to run and we're going to attack.
[01:35:40] No, these are situations where the alternative to attacking is being defensive laying down
[01:35:46] and dying and continuing to get picked off and snipers until you get overrun.
[01:35:52] Now they meet up with, finally, they meet up with these other British troops.
[01:35:59] Back to the book, someone was leading us into a garden of a large house.
[01:36:02] The men dropped to the ground as they halted the conscious that they were now safe with
[01:36:05] houses and other British troops around them.
[01:36:09] Others after a swig from a water bottle, lay supine unconscious in instant sleep.
[01:36:15] I counted them.
[01:36:16] Jimmy Gray, John Simmons, and Sergeant Winer were there.
[01:36:21] Sergeant Major Kelly was missing, someone had seen him fall in the rush.
[01:36:25] There were just 49 other men about half from sea company.
[01:36:30] Last night there had been 200, the night before 500.
[01:36:42] Other in these positions.
[01:36:45] And they're about to get attacked just below in the garden, but out of sight another
[01:36:50] Bren opened up.
[01:36:51] It was Jimmy Gray's century at the garden gate.
[01:36:54] There was a glimpse of a camouflage figure running through the trees opposite.
[01:36:58] No more than 100 yards away diagonally across our front towards the air landing troops.
[01:37:03] Then a couple more.
[01:37:04] Jimmy's Bren fired again and one of the figures pitched forward rolling over, carried on
[01:37:09] by its own momentum.
[01:37:10] We would have to fight, and this is their talking, talking about the fact that they're
[01:37:18] in the houses now in this village.
[01:37:22] We would have to fight from the house itself, not from the trenches in the garden.
[01:37:27] It was a sturdy building with thick solid walls, and in any case the garden was too small
[01:37:31] for the purpose.
[01:37:32] From these upper windows, we would have an extra range and observation to fire diagonally
[01:37:37] down the road in front of the houses held by units to the left and right.
[01:37:42] 15 minutes later, the trim Dutch house had been wrecked.
[01:37:47] Every pain of glass had been smashed, and every picture and mirror knock from the walls
[01:37:51] there was no time to be careful.
[01:37:53] In the center of each room barricades had been built, well back from the windows out of sight
[01:37:57] of the bush, but sighted so that every scrap of ground outside was covered.
[01:38:02] Sideboards and chests of drawer stuff with books are bedding, made the barricades, contents
[01:38:07] of the furniture flung and heaps into corners of the rooms.
[01:38:11] Matchuses were rolled down into the basement ready for use if needed by wounded men.
[01:38:16] More books crammed into drawers, were blocking those windows, not required for shooting
[01:38:20] through.
[01:38:21] Fortunately, the owner of the house possessed a fine library from its content seemed
[01:38:26] a-whose a doctor.
[01:38:28] With gray, I walked around the house for a final check before leaving to return to my own
[01:38:33] headquarters at the rear.
[01:38:35] Like vandals might have swept through it, some woman's life work ruined in the time it
[01:38:40] took to drink a cup of coffee.
[01:38:49] An explosion from above followed by the clatter of tiles falling from the roof drowned
[01:38:54] out the noise from the gun.
[01:38:55] Another bomb burst in the garden just outside the window sending a couple fragments whistling
[01:38:59] into the room.
[01:39:00] Now the bush were hitting us with mortars as well.
[01:39:05] A bullet splintered of the empty frame behind me and buried itself in the ceiling, a warning
[01:39:11] that I was far too close to the back bedroom window.
[01:39:15] There was a sniper behind us as well as the spandle.
[01:39:19] A quick movement in the garden of the house caught my eye.
[01:39:22] Then two figures in the wrong sort of camouflaged darted from behind a bush into the shelter
[01:39:26] of a wall.
[01:39:27] They were bush, not British.
[01:39:29] So now the enemy was indeed all around us.
[01:39:32] There was no doubt about it now.
[01:39:35] John Simmons and his men were in the houses where they had been left that morning.
[01:39:39] John had made strong points out of a couple of houses, smaller but just as robust as the
[01:39:44] ones held by gray.
[01:39:46] The two groups had been working closely together largely I felt certain because of John's
[01:39:51] charm of manner and determination.
[01:39:54] This young gunner had done very well.
[01:39:56] It hardly seemed possible that most of his men hardly knew him by sight yesterday.
[01:40:01] Today he has welded the survivors of four different companies of a unit into of another
[01:40:06] arm into a tight knit entity.
[01:40:10] Well capable of carrying on the fight.
[01:40:13] All day they had held firm, killing and wounding quite a lot of enemy, losing only one
[01:40:17] man themselves, a corpile of a company whose hand had been blown in half by a flying
[01:40:22] mortar splinter.
[01:40:25] Mind and filthy though his face was eyes red rimmed and chin stained with three days worth
[01:40:32] of fair fuzzy down.
[01:40:34] John still moved briskly, a reminder to all of us that we could still keep going.
[01:40:41] So he's got guys that are stepping up big time.
[01:40:45] Inside the houses we felt reasonably safe from the shells and bullets but there was always
[01:40:49] some cause for the officers and senior NCOs to move about and open from one building to
[01:40:53] another.
[01:40:54] It was the same as it had been in the woods.
[01:40:56] The officers and sergeants sort of straighter, greater chance of being killed or wounded
[01:41:00] as their men.
[01:41:02] All the same, it was easier for an officer.
[01:41:05] With so much to do, he had little time to worry about his own safety.
[01:41:09] Also he always had to try and act the part to set an example to the others.
[01:41:14] An officer had to exude confidence however hard it might be.
[01:41:19] But because he always had to try to keep a grip on himself, it helped him forget the danger.
[01:41:24] Very true.
[01:41:27] Very true.
[01:41:28] Got a lot of things on your mind.
[01:41:34] They get a massive bombardment in these positions that they're in.
[01:41:42] Back to the book, the Germans must be softening us up in preparation for something more
[01:41:45] serious.
[01:41:46] Their ammunition seemed unlimited.
[01:41:49] The bombardment ended quite suddenly, rather as it had started.
[01:41:53] This would be it.
[01:41:55] Nudging Williams to get his head up from behind the barricade, I shouted a warning to the
[01:41:59] others.
[01:42:00] Elkins and bow were in the next room and the two signulars who had moved up to the bedroom
[01:42:03] at the back.
[01:42:05] The stutter of the bread gun cut across the woods.
[01:42:09] Bowers rifle-footed next door and then Williams was firing a succession of bursts from
[01:42:13] his bread gun.
[01:42:15] In the orchard opposite, Germans were running through the trees towards us, several dropped.
[01:42:21] This could only be the start of an attack.
[01:42:24] Now from either flank, the sound of rifles and machine guns reached us, accompanied by
[01:42:29] the thought of exploding grenades.
[01:42:30] The attack was coming in all along our front.
[01:42:35] Some of the Germans among the fruit trees were firing back, a couple of rifle bullets splintered
[01:42:39] the front of the wardrobe.
[01:42:42] And more gray figures were lumbering towards us through the trees, some fell, others ducked
[01:42:46] behind the puny trees.
[01:42:49] They didn't stand a chance.
[01:42:51] It was like shooting targets on the practice range.
[01:42:55] The Germans and the mortars had been forced to stop because their troops were so close.
[01:43:02] So it was possible to fire slow, carefully aimed shots with little or no distraction.
[01:43:10] The only way out of the orchard was through the single gap in the high fence, but the enemy
[01:43:15] soldiers never got within 20 yards of it.
[01:43:19] A tall German officer was standing in the middle of the drive, out in the open clear of
[01:43:24] the trees, waving his arms to the men behind him.
[01:43:29] No more than 50 yards away, every detail of his face and uniform was clearly visible.
[01:43:35] He was a handsome young man, fair-haired and smartly turned out.
[01:43:41] Already he'd been standing there for about five seconds, encouraging his men to advance.
[01:43:47] As I leveled my sights on the German officer, I knew that I was looking at someone
[01:43:51] who was just about to die.
[01:43:54] It seemed a pity.
[01:43:57] He was such a courageous boy, just the sort.
[01:44:01] As the sort one would like to have had as a platoon commander.
[01:44:06] My fingers started to squeeze the trigger, but it was too late.
[01:44:10] Someone else had fired.
[01:44:12] The German fell, spread-eagled and lay still.
[01:44:17] At least he died quickly.
[01:44:20] The death of the young officer marked the end of the attack.
[01:44:25] Now no one moved in the orchard except for a single wounded man squirming his way back through
[01:44:31] the trees.
[01:44:35] So it's interesting when you take the leader and the leader goes down and the attacks over.
[01:44:43] Now also it's important to note that although the leader stood up and encouraged the attack
[01:44:50] by taking that risk of being out there in front of everyone, in this case it didn't
[01:44:54] work out well because he got shot, killed, and the attack faltered.
[01:45:00] Perhaps if he could have found a little bit better of a position to do that from, then
[01:45:04] maybe he would have been able to encourage his troops and stay alive.
[01:45:12] Back to the book, but we had won no more than a temporary respite.
[01:45:17] 15 minutes later we could hear the unnerving noise once again.
[01:45:21] Those were clattering towards us.
[01:45:24] So I don't know why I haven't talked about this yet, but here you have these airborne
[01:45:29] troops on the ground and their biggest fear is tanks and you've heard me talk many times
[01:45:37] about my love for tanks and how effective and awesome they are as tools and as weapons
[01:45:46] and the way that the tankers utilize them, they're just they're just awesome machines.
[01:45:53] But here you have the tables turned and the good guys don't have any effective way of
[01:46:02] stopping these tanks.
[01:46:03] You can shoot a machine gun all day long at a panzer tank and it's not going to do a damn
[01:46:09] thing.
[01:46:11] And so it can just, and by the way you hide and build and cool, a tank will go right through
[01:46:15] a building.
[01:46:16] They go right through buildings.
[01:46:18] They will go right through a building.
[01:46:20] Like it looks like a construction piece of heavy equipment.
[01:46:23] That's what it looks like.
[01:46:24] It'll go right through a building like it's nothing.
[01:46:26] So these guys are absolutely horrified of the tank showing up.
[01:46:31] That's their fear.
[01:46:35] Tracks were clattering toward us, a gun footage and the dark red house opposite began
[01:46:41] to fall apart as round after round crashed into it.
[01:46:45] Also flashes from the far side of the orchard revealed the position of the attacker, but
[01:46:49] there was nothing we could do.
[01:46:52] At least the men were not waiting in the house, but slipping one after another out the door
[01:46:57] back across the road to the headquarters house.
[01:47:01] On either side, the guns were firing.
[01:47:05] Now it was our turn.
[01:47:10] The tank wrecks some of the houses and then it the tank leaves.
[01:47:18] So here we go.
[01:47:19] It was time to strike back.
[01:47:21] The tanks had gone and as yet the bush did not appear to have occupied the houses.
[01:47:26] Lying out there in the rear gardens overlooked from the windows, we were vulnerable indeed.
[01:47:32] Soon the morgering would start again.
[01:47:34] Then we would be safe for back in the ruin buildings.
[01:47:38] John Simmons listened to the instructions, the young captain's manner was as relaxed
[01:47:43] as ever.
[01:47:45] Calm and outwardly self-confident.
[01:47:47] He somehow managed to give the impression that he was almost enjoying the morning's
[01:47:51] work.
[01:47:52] Possibly he was making that a point.
[01:47:54] Subconsciously perhaps that a gunner could always take charge of 30 infantrymen.
[01:48:00] But there were undoubtedly immense reserves of strength hidden behind that cool exterior.
[01:48:07] As he lay behind the bed of half dead pea plants scanning the houses for any sign of
[01:48:12] German occupants, there was no trace of disquiet in his voice as he discussed his orders
[01:48:16] to counter attack and clear the street of the enemy.
[01:48:21] 15 minutes after John had gone, I was still in the same place in the vegetable patch watching
[01:48:26] the second hand of my watch creep towards the top of the dial.
[01:48:31] Then graze weapon opened up on the right, firing back into the rooms of the houses
[01:48:36] more in the hope of distracting the enemy than providing covering fire.
[01:48:41] The danger to John's men lay on the other side, the front of the houses.
[01:48:46] Now John's three-bremned guns were firing as well on the left.
[01:48:52] The assault party would soon be moving into the street.
[01:48:57] It came.
[01:48:59] The sustained rattle of a spandown gun.
[01:49:03] Just one, then a second.
[01:49:06] After that there was silence, except for one or two rifle shots.
[01:49:12] I waited, lying in the vegetable patch almost to straw with worry.
[01:49:19] Something was badly wrong.
[01:49:20] Nothing could be seen from here, but I had to resist the temptation of going to find out
[01:49:24] for myself what had happened.
[01:49:26] I must avoid getting involved in the skirmish.
[01:49:31] Then corporal day, now John's second in command was running through the flower beds toward
[01:49:35] me.
[01:49:37] Days face said everything, even before he started to speak.
[01:49:43] The attack had failed.
[01:49:45] It had failed the moment John had been killed, out there in the middle of the street, and
[01:49:49] ten yards in front of day, and the rest of the assault party John had died in just the same
[01:49:55] way as that young German officer this morning.
[01:50:00] And he had finished it.
[01:50:02] The rest of them, including day, had turned and run, but in some extraordinary way no one
[01:50:09] else had been hit.
[01:50:12] Day made no excuse, no attempt to excuse himself, telling the story factually and not trying
[01:50:18] to put a gloss on the incident.
[01:50:21] The implication was clear they had been asked to do too much.
[01:50:29] So now I had been responsible for killing John as well.
[01:50:34] It had been so simple.
[01:50:36] I had issued the orders, and then John had walked out into the middle of that road to
[01:50:39] be shot down by the machine gun.
[01:50:45] I should not have done it.
[01:50:48] The counterattacks should never have been attempted.
[01:50:51] The men were no longer capable of making such an effort.
[01:50:56] They could still hang onto their positions, fighting from behind cover, but after six days
[01:51:00] of continuous battle, they lacked the will to get to their feet and go for the enemy.
[01:51:07] In the woods, it had just been possible to urge them forward in one last surge of willpower,
[01:51:12] but since then, they'd endured a further 48 hours of death, starvation, thirst, and fatigue.
[01:51:22] In the woods, it was men from my own company, today it had been different.
[01:51:27] Today a mixture of men, survivors of four different companies, had been left to follow a gunner
[01:51:32] officer whom they hardly knew.
[01:51:36] There was a limit to what soldiers could be asked to do, and I had gone beyond those
[01:51:41] limits.
[01:51:44] And so John Simmons had died.
[01:52:03] That's the burden of command.
[01:52:10] Back to the book.
[01:52:12] It was impossible to understand why the Germans were not using their armor to support this
[01:52:16] infiltration by their infantry.
[01:52:19] If they had done so, all resistance would have collapsed long ago, and the tanks would
[01:52:23] have been on the lawns.
[01:52:27] The crushing news that the brigadier had been badly wounded came through on the telephone
[01:52:31] just before the line went dead once again.
[01:52:34] The bush were now among the houses and gardens, which the glider pilots had been holding,
[01:52:39] and gray had reported that he was being shot at from two sides at the same time.
[01:52:46] The quartermaster had also sent word that the enemy were behind him, and that he had
[01:52:52] long ago lost all contact with the rekiyon as left.
[01:53:04] They are just in a wretched state, and he goes to meet with the colonel in one of the
[01:53:11] buildings.
[01:53:12] The colonel seemed to be trying to break something to us gently.
[01:53:16] Then it came out.
[01:53:18] It was hard to believe, harder still to understand.
[01:53:22] The division was to be withdrawn over the line that night.
[01:53:27] It was all over.
[01:53:30] It had been. It had only been possible to ferry about 250 men of the door sits over the
[01:53:35] river before dawn, a profitless addition to the perimeter garrison.
[01:53:40] The second army had overreached itself and trying to get to us, and although the troops
[01:53:44] were purporting northward, they lacked the strength across the river and continued the
[01:53:48] advance into Germany.
[01:53:51] Already the bush were hammering from the flanks at their narrow lines of communication.
[01:53:59] The operation had failed.
[01:54:03] Everything had been in vain.
[01:54:06] It was all a waste.
[01:54:10] Listening to the outline of what had to be done that night, it was hard to concentrate
[01:54:13] on the details.
[01:54:16] The first emotion was grief.
[01:54:19] And then utter disappointment.
[01:54:33] The battalion had been destroyed to no purpose.
[01:54:34] And that's it.
[01:54:35] They get the order.
[01:54:37] That night to leave.
[01:54:40] And they come up with a plan.
[01:54:43] They actually follow rope.
[01:54:45] They put rope at night down towards the river where they're going to get extracted.
[01:54:49] And at night they attempt to follow that rope down there.
[01:54:53] And of course, along the way, they lose more men.
[01:54:56] Men get separated.
[01:54:57] Men don't hang on.
[01:54:58] They get lost.
[01:54:59] And they lose even more men as they're trying to make it to their extraction point.
[01:55:04] But he does end up with a small group of people at this extraction point.
[01:55:08] There's Canadian boats there to bring them across the Rhine River.
[01:55:14] Back to the book, the Canadians were already pulling the last men into the boat.
[01:55:17] And I was standing with Harrison, alone in the river.
[01:55:21] When I heard a winers' voice, harshly insisting that no one would be left behind.
[01:55:27] The young cockson needed no further urging but importers to be careful as the boat was
[01:55:31] grossly overloaded.
[01:55:33] Then Harrison pushed me up over the side and the two of us flopped down behind the cockson
[01:55:38] as the engine went into gear and the boat moved towards midstream.
[01:55:42] So now they get across the river, they get dropped off and to answer your question earlier.
[01:55:50] Once they get dropped off on the other side, they're on the western side of the Rhine River,
[01:55:55] it's basically secure area.
[01:55:58] Even though it was only several hundred yards away, it was relatively secure.
[01:56:04] And now what they have to do is they have to march back about five miles to get to even
[01:56:10] more secure base.
[01:56:12] Here we go back to the book.
[01:56:13] As we reach the track, which after a few hundred yards led us to the road, when I stopped
[01:56:19] the men flopped to the ground empty and lifeless, lacking any wish to go on.
[01:56:25] More parties have men appeared through the darkness, shambling in the exhaustion of relief,
[01:56:30] alter-ended, devoid of the willpower needed to summon up further effort.
[01:56:36] There's only one way to make the two mile march bearable and old fashioned remedy.
[01:56:42] I called the Sergeant Weiner to fall the men in threes.
[01:56:47] The discipline bark bounced back to me as Weiner pulled himself to his feet shouting
[01:56:51] to the men to fall in.
[01:56:53] There is no trace of query or surprise in Weiner's voice and the men shuffled to their feet.
[01:57:01] That's your route training right there.
[01:57:04] You're exhausted after eight days of continuous combat.
[01:57:07] You're just done and the Sergeant says, all right, on your feet, form a column of threes
[01:57:14] and you do it.
[01:57:18] There get close to the end.
[01:57:20] I'm now that I can see the camp and I halted them.
[01:57:24] There was only one way to end such a march.
[01:57:27] It was pointless perhaps, but I decided to make the final gesture.
[01:57:31] Knowing them to attention, I ordered them to slope arms and to march by the left to attention.
[01:57:38] I sensed their appreciation as their shoulders went back.
[01:57:42] This was the way they always returned to camp.
[01:57:45] This was the way they always finished.
[01:57:48] As they stepped off for the last 50 yards, they were even squinging their arms.
[01:57:55] They marched back into this camp once they get into this camp, they get loaded up into
[01:58:00] a vehicle, a big military transport vehicle that's going to take them further to the rear
[01:58:05] where they can get some treatment and they're loaded into that vehicle.
[01:58:12] Here we go back to the book, the canopy of the truck now sheltered us, but my shivering
[01:58:16] became uncontrollable.
[01:58:19] I knew I was becoming light headed and could hear myself grieving aloud for those that
[01:58:24] we had left behind, particularly for those who had been lost during the withdrawal down
[01:58:28] the riverbank.
[01:58:31] There was silence in the truck.
[01:58:34] Then I heard, as if from a long way off, the voice of Sergeant Weiner, Client, Calm
[01:58:39] and Flat, saying that none of them would have got back if it had not been for me.
[01:58:46] It was true to say that I would never have got back if it hadn't been for them, but
[01:58:51] I shall always be grateful to Weiner for having said it.
[01:58:58] The next thing I remember was Weiner and Harrison, half carrying me into what seemed to
[01:59:03] be a hospital.
[01:59:06] Someone was stripping off my clothes and dressing me in pajamas, then I felt the prick of
[01:59:12] a needle in my arm.
[01:59:17] I was awake.
[01:59:20] The sun shining into the windows of the ward.
[01:59:25] And orderly brought tea and food on a tray, I lay between the clean sheets, looking at
[01:59:29] the torn and filthy garments on the chair by the side of the bed.
[01:59:35] There was nothing wrong with me now.
[01:59:38] I saw that my hand was wrapped in a clean bandage.
[01:59:42] When the nursing orderly came to remove the tray, he brought me the message that a soldier
[01:59:46] was waiting in the corridor to see me.
[01:59:50] As soon as the orderly left, the room I slipped out of bed and put on my clothes and went
[01:59:54] out in the corridor.
[01:59:58] Waiting there was Harrison, a broad smile on his face, telling me that Captain Gray
[02:00:02] and Mr. Elkins and turned up with aid to the missing men.
[02:00:06] Another 20 stragglers had also arrived from somewhere or another.
[02:00:12] But that was the lot.
[02:00:15] That was the battalion.
[02:00:18] Three officers and 43 soldiers.
[02:00:25] We walked out the door of the hospital side, side by side.
[02:00:33] The week's September sun shone down on the battered buildings.
[02:00:39] Away in the distance, the dull rumble of the battle still rolled down from the north.
[02:00:48] And once all the men were recovered, and that's the end of the book.
[02:01:07] When all the men were recovered, and when you look at the actual battalion of the 156 pairs,
[02:01:12] you battalion, it looked like this, 313 men were captured, many of those were wounded.
[02:01:18] There was 98 killed in action, and there was a total of 68 from the battalion that
[02:01:24] made it across the Rhine safely.
[02:01:28] And those 68 men, if they could heal up, were then sent to the other battalions inside
[02:01:36] the first parabirdade.
[02:01:39] And the 156th parachute battalion was actually disbanded.
[02:01:46] It ceased to exist.
[02:01:51] Jeffree Powell went on to retire from the Army, the British Army in 1964.
[02:02:00] He retired as a major general.
[02:02:02] He was awarded the military cross, which is Britain's third highest award for valor.
[02:02:10] And this is what his citation reads.
[02:02:14] At Arnum after his commanding officer had become a casualty, major pal took command of the remnants
[02:02:19] of the battalion.
[02:02:21] Up to this time, he conducted himself with the greatest gallantry.
[02:02:24] For the remaining six days, he retained control of his unit, and also of the men of other
[02:02:30] units in the area under the most difficult conditions.
[02:02:35] Heavy fire for mortars artillery and self-propelled guns never stopped his activity in
[02:02:40] getting round his section of the perimeter and encouraging his men to greater efforts.
[02:02:48] Throughout the whole period of the Arnum battle, in spite of being wounded, this officer showed
[02:02:54] himself to be a gallant leader of men and the most capable fighter and one whose bravery
[02:02:59] was a source of inspiration to the men under his command and to all those around him.
[02:03:13] And I think it's pretty clear that if you read a book like this, General Powell is still
[02:03:22] a source of inspiration as are the rest of these incredibly brave men and also a source
[02:03:32] of leadership lessons of what to do and what not to do, and it's also an incredible reminder
[02:03:46] of that heavy burden of command.
[02:03:53] And the fact of the matter is when you lead you own every decision and every action not only
[02:04:00] of yourself but of your men.
[02:04:08] And with that burden, you owe it to them to be as well prepared, to be as tactically
[02:04:18] sound and to be as physically and mentally strong as you can possibly be.
[02:04:29] And that goes for any leadership position when you are a leader, be as prepared as you
[02:04:35] possibly can.
[02:04:40] And then you go out and you lead and you lead with courage and you lead with resolution
[02:04:46] and you lead with boldness.
[02:04:54] Boldness like Jeffrey Bell, then the officers in the men of the 156th Parishute Battalion.
[02:05:05] Pretty amazing book that, you know, like I said, I got this book six days ago or something.
[02:05:20] Somebody just sent it to me and I gave it the little tests, what I kind of opened books
[02:05:26] up because people saw me a lot of books and I gave it the test, you know, I opened
[02:05:31] up by read a couple of sections and it immediately, you know, I'll give all open to a book
[02:05:36] in four or five different places to see what it reads like.
[02:05:41] And this, you know, within the first page, the first page that I read is that, oh, we
[02:05:46] it looks like we have a winner here.
[02:05:48] This one's going to be on the podcast because it's just impactful and the account now.
[02:05:57] In the back of the book, he talks about the, the individuals and it just reads some
[02:06:04] of them off here.
[02:06:05] The Brigadier was General John Hackett.
[02:06:12] The Colonel was Dickie DeVo of the Grenadier Guards.
[02:06:19] His fellow Grenadier was Surgeon Major Dennis Gay.
[02:06:26] His Batman, the guy that he talks about Harrison throughout the book, the guy that's
[02:06:29] there from the beginning to the end, always by the side that was actually a guy named Fred
[02:06:33] Tracy.
[02:06:34] The guy named David N. unwitting the book is the character in the book.
[02:06:38] The real guy was named Michael Page who had been Powell's best man and who's son, Jeffrey
[02:06:47] born posthumously had another son named Michael and Luke Tyler and Sergeant Wyner and
[02:06:57] Jones and Johnson as these were all real people.
[02:07:01] So, you know, this is another guy that very similar to Major John Glover who said he had
[02:07:08] a hard time writing about himself in the first person.
[02:07:11] You know, I did this and I did that.
[02:07:12] That's the same thing that Powell said.
[02:07:14] You know, he had a hard time writing until he just made it about some other, he put made
[02:07:18] some other character in his hand and wrote from that perspective.
[02:07:22] But, man, you definitely this book, like I said, I read, I don't know, 5% of it.
[02:07:31] It's not a huge book though, actually.
[02:07:33] It's only a couple hundred pages long and it's a very fast read.
[02:07:37] Did you find it to give you this weird stressful feeling reading, no?
[02:07:42] Absolutely.
[02:07:43] It's interesting too, it's like just more stressful.
[02:07:45] It is stressful.
[02:07:46] It is.
[02:07:47] And I was debating when to tell you and when to tell everyone that this is not a good, that
[02:07:53] this is a good story, right?
[02:07:55] This isn't a positive thing.
[02:07:57] And I kind of just, I don't know, when I actually said that, hey, they're not going to
[02:08:02] win.
[02:08:03] I mean, I said that the operation market garden was a failure.
[02:08:06] But, you know, what does that really look like?
[02:08:08] You know what I mean?
[02:08:09] Like, you don't know what that looks like until you get reading this book and then you
[02:08:12] start to feel what it feels like.
[02:08:13] It absolutely.
[02:08:14] And when you read the whole book, man, it is just coming apart.
[02:08:19] It's just a little misfortune, a little misfortune, they're just coming and they don't
[02:08:23] stop.
[02:08:24] They just don't stop.
[02:08:26] It's a nightmare scenario.
[02:08:29] And yeah, and there's tons of great lessons learned.
[02:08:32] It's so amazing.
[02:08:33] Because I never read this book before.
[02:08:34] I just got it.
[02:08:35] But it's amazing.
[02:08:37] Covered move.
[02:08:38] Yeah.
[02:08:39] Decentualized command.
[02:08:40] Yeah.
[02:08:41] That's cute.
[02:08:42] Even that part when you're keeping it simple.
[02:08:44] Everything that we learned, I should have learned this years ago.
[02:08:52] And when I think about, you know, I was, you look back at your life, right?
[02:08:57] And you say to yourself, what could I have done better?
[02:08:59] What could I do different?
[02:09:00] And, you know, everyone in the SEAL teams, like basically you get one shot at each
[02:09:04] job.
[02:09:05] Other than just being a shooter and a platoon, that you can do three or four times.
[02:09:10] If you're lucky.
[02:09:12] But then once you get into a leadership position, you're like you're an assistant platoon
[02:09:16] commander.
[02:09:17] You do that one time.
[02:09:18] Then you're a platoon commander.
[02:09:19] You do that one time.
[02:09:21] Then you're a task unit commander.
[02:09:22] You do that one time.
[02:09:23] Generally, sometimes the guys rarely guys do more than one of those.
[02:09:28] Same thing on the enlisted side.
[02:09:29] Guy gets to do an a leading pedigoster.
[02:09:32] Does that one time?
[02:09:33] Chief pedigoster of a platoon.
[02:09:34] Platoon chief does that one time.
[02:09:37] You don't get to repeat the jobs.
[02:09:42] And so basically when you're finally getting good at your job, you're done.
[02:09:46] And now you've got to go get the next job up the chain of command.
[02:09:49] So for me, it was always, and now looking back and even talking to my SEAL buddies now,
[02:09:56] like how can we prepare them better?
[02:09:58] So they know what we had to learn during the job.
[02:10:03] It's a hard thing to do because a lot of stuff you actually have to learn from
[02:10:07] experience.
[02:10:08] Yeah.
[02:10:09] And actually we talked about that at the last master, which is that was a big part that
[02:10:14] we talked about.
[02:10:15] If you're going to get good at something, you have two choices.
[02:10:18] Experience or training.
[02:10:20] And training is a way to condense experience down and distill it.
[02:10:24] That's what was great about when I was running training on the West Coast.
[02:10:28] We got to really condense that experience.
[02:10:31] Sure.
[02:10:32] I mean, guys went through, guys went through hellacious training.
[02:10:36] And we provide total chaos for them.
[02:10:39] That most guys wouldn't experience that kind of chaos in their whole career or in 10 careers.
[02:10:44] But they would get it and they would get pushed to the parts that when they got out of
[02:10:47] the battlefield, they were ready for the chaos that was out there.
[02:10:51] Because we trained them and we pushed them further and harder during training.
[02:10:55] Then we hoped they would get pushed on the battlefield.
[02:10:58] Yeah.
[02:10:59] It's crazy.
[02:11:00] Even that cover and move even when they're retreating.
[02:11:02] It's like it showed like how you got to keep that discipline with that.
[02:11:06] It's kind of like, you know, like an MMA fighter or something.
[02:11:10] And the guy starts getting hit on the inside and rather than still covering up a little
[02:11:16] bit while he goes back, he runs away or turns his back or something like that.
[02:11:19] Turn your back a bit.
[02:11:20] Yeah.
[02:11:21] Turn your back and your done.
[02:11:24] But great book.
[02:11:25] I definitely recommend it for your beating list.
[02:11:28] Yeah.
[02:11:29] There was that part in there that the guy came up to.
[02:11:33] I think reload ammo or something.
[02:11:35] And the guy's sitting there.
[02:11:37] Yeah.
[02:11:38] And he's doing.
[02:11:39] So he gets like scolded or whatever.
[02:11:41] He turns out he's wounded or he's injured.
[02:11:43] That was an interesting little lesson there.
[02:11:46] You just don't know.
[02:11:47] So you can't just start going off.
[02:11:49] Totally true.
[02:11:50] And I don't know if you remember somebody asked us a question one time about how do I
[02:11:56] these people that have had everything given to them.
[02:11:59] And I've had a, I grew up in a tough neighborhood.
[02:12:02] I was like, oh, you actually don't know what that person's been through.
[02:12:05] And we had that whole discussion.
[02:12:06] Yeah.
[02:12:07] That's the same thing true on a day to day basis with every other human being that you're
[02:12:10] dealing with.
[02:12:11] You don't know what they're going through.
[02:12:12] You don't know what triumphs and tragedies they've had in their life.
[02:12:15] You don't know what just happened to them this morning.
[02:12:18] So the recommended course of action is you give someone a little bit of slack when we don't
[02:12:23] know them.
[02:12:24] You know?
[02:12:25] Yeah.
[02:12:26] You've seen that at St. Philippe when he goes to talk to the girl.
[02:12:29] Come on.
[02:12:30] He's actually, he was pretty much this, but just on science field.
[02:12:33] So he goes to talk to the screen.
[02:12:34] He's like, I got to talk to that girl.
[02:12:36] She's hot or whatever.
[02:12:38] He goes up, turn you and he's like, hey, hello.
[02:12:40] Excuse me.
[02:12:41] Her back is kind of turned.
[02:12:42] He's like, excuse me.
[02:12:44] Hello, hello.
[02:12:45] Like, getting any starts to get real mad that she's not listening to him.
[02:12:48] Finally he walks it like more close to her and she kind of starts to turn around and
[02:12:52] he's like, oh, so now you pay attention.
[02:12:54] What do you deaf?
[02:12:55] And she's like, bingo like science tool.
[02:12:57] Oh.
[02:12:58] She is deaf.
[02:12:59] Yeah.
[02:13:00] You know, they got to chill out.
[02:13:01] Yeah.
[02:13:02] Find out about people first.
[02:13:03] Free start.
[02:13:04] Make sure they make sure the regimental sergeant major isn't wounded in both legs before
[02:13:09] you start dressing him down.
[02:13:10] I know.
[02:13:11] Yeah, man.
[02:13:12] That's a good thing.
[02:13:15] He put that in this book.
[02:13:16] You know, that's pretty humble.
[02:13:17] Yeah.
[02:13:18] Firm to put this in this book.
[02:13:19] You know what I mean?
[02:13:20] Yep.
[02:13:21] And that other part where they were all what, like tired and stuff, right?
[02:13:27] Or they're defeated, essentially.
[02:13:29] They were actually, you mean when they were basically broken men?
[02:13:32] Yeah.
[02:13:33] And then they got up and they just started charging getting into it.
[02:13:36] Yeah.
[02:13:37] Default aggressive.
[02:13:38] Default aggressive part.
[02:13:40] That's like, like, in why there's big synopids.
[02:13:45] 10.
[02:13:46] They're like, they're kind of bigger than like a few long.
[02:13:50] No, no.
[02:13:51] They're bigger than like synopids that I've seen here.
[02:13:53] Okay.
[02:13:54] Give me a figure.
[02:13:55] Like six inches.
[02:13:56] It's like six is like a normal big synopids.
[02:14:00] Okay.
[02:14:01] And they still get bigger.
[02:14:03] Anyway, they're, I mean compared to you, you know, that they're, they're little
[02:14:07] bucks, they're little whatever.
[02:14:08] And you just step on it.
[02:14:10] But like when you start messing with it and it starts to get nuts, it's super
[02:14:13] entertaining.
[02:14:14] I'm just saying that they're cheating like that.
[02:14:17] I don't know, but they can chase you out of your room.
[02:14:20] You got chased out of your room by a certain thing.
[02:14:21] Well, anything like, even like a, like a wasp or you know, like with these little things
[02:14:25] that are way smaller than you.
[02:14:27] And they just get nuts.
[02:14:28] And then, like you don't want to mess with it.
[02:14:29] You know, so life, life was over my house as a while ago, a couple of years ago.
[02:14:34] And there was a lizard in my house.
[02:14:37] Like about a, yeah, thought a nine inch lizard.
[02:14:41] And so my son and life are going to try and catch this lizard.
[02:14:46] And they're being weak.
[02:14:48] Do like, yeah, they're like, oh, you know,
[02:14:50] they're like, oh, wait, wait, no, grab it.
[02:14:52] Get a box on it and all.
[02:14:53] So I come in, Mr. Tuff guy.
[02:14:55] You know, I come in reached, I go, just grab that thing.
[02:14:59] You will seize reach down.
[02:15:01] I reached down a grab this thing.
[02:15:02] This thing turns its head and bites.
[02:15:05] Yeah, so it's a nice screen.
[02:15:08] Like, like the Jim Carrey, like, oh, yeah.
[02:15:12] And I flipped my hand.
[02:15:13] It was, it was absolutely hilarious because I went from being a big tough guy to screaming.
[02:15:18] Oh, and having a lizard bit onto my finger.
[02:15:22] Good blood. By the way, yeah, this thing drew blood.
[02:15:25] Yeah, on my thumb.
[02:15:27] So yeah, I was default aggressive, but it didn't work out.
[02:15:30] The lizard was more default aggressive than I was.
[02:15:33] Yeah, see, and that is funny.
[02:15:35] That's a funny story for a couple of reasons, in my opinion.
[02:15:37] But that is the exact same concept, though.
[02:15:40] Where if you would like, like, how you said in the book,
[02:15:43] just kept your head, you smash that lizard.
[02:15:45] That is what if I wanted to catch a live,
[02:15:47] I wasn't trying to kill it.
[02:15:48] Yeah.
[02:15:49] But still, I should have been more aggressive.
[02:15:50] The bite didn't even hurt, right?
[02:15:53] I just shocked me.
[02:15:54] Yeah, it just shocked me.
[02:15:55] That was pretty broad.
[02:15:56] Yeah, I wasn't ready for the, the gnashing of the teeth.
[02:15:59] Getting nuts, man.
[02:16:00] Yeah, those lizards, we have a lot of those.
[02:16:02] Especially when it gets hot, I mean, I'm assuming it's the same kind.
[02:16:06] There are these, but here's the thing, growing up on quite a disease thing.
[02:16:09] They call them, we call them convenience, but they're like,
[02:16:12] a null, a null, a, and a, oh,
[02:16:14] L, E, that's what you spent, spell it.
[02:16:16] They turn green or brown or whatever.
[02:16:18] When they get, they get pretty big and they're super aggressive.
[02:16:22] Like, when you grab them, oh, that's the first red thing comes out of their neck
[02:16:25] and they start biting you.
[02:16:27] And you get them to it when you hold them after a while they start to calm down.
[02:16:31] And I think they just start to get sick and stuff.
[02:16:34] I don't know, I don't know, but they calm down.
[02:16:36] So you can do this thing where basically it can.
[02:16:38] If you have a lizard's head, you go like this and he'll go like,
[02:16:40] they'll try to bite you.
[02:16:42] So what you do is when he calms down and I'm like,
[02:16:43] what a ray when you grab him, he's trying to kill you.
[02:16:46] But when he calms down after I don't know, three, four minutes, you do that
[02:16:49] and he'll kill, keep kind of like, how do you lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen lessen
[02:16:53] he'll always do that though, but he'll just be a lot less aggressive.
[02:16:56] And then if you put your finger in his mouth, he'll bite you and he won't let go.
[02:17:00] So you got to kind of drag your finger out and yeah,
[02:17:03] it'll, it can cause blood or whatever.
[02:17:05] But what we do is, and you can proceed, let picture the,
[02:17:09] we do that and we put it on, put the lizard on our ears.
[02:17:12] So the lizard would be unhearing.
[02:17:14] And yeah, biting areas you'd have two lizards hanging down.
[02:17:17] But anyway, the point there being,
[02:17:21] fucking, so if you can keep your, yeah, when you grow up with that stuff,
[02:17:25] like those lizards are not scary, even if they're aggressive and some of them,
[02:17:28] they get pretty like big and bulky and they're like dang,
[02:17:31] a thing has some power to it, this little lizard, you know?
[02:17:34] And but even here, one, one, I grab them, they're like, oh no,
[02:17:39] I wouldn't scream like you, well, yeah, I'm just saying experience.
[02:17:42] And lizard got me dude, it was awful.
[02:17:46] It was awful. Well, being prepared, I guess is what we're talking about being aggressive.
[02:17:51] Once you get default aggressive with letting anybody know if they want to support this podcast,
[02:17:56] maybe how they could do it.
[02:17:57] Also support Jockel's traumatizing experience with lizards.
[02:18:01] With lizards.
[02:18:02] So bite it.
[02:18:03] It's fingers and him screaming.
[02:18:04] Oh, what's it, laughing?
[02:18:06] It was laughing my son.
[02:18:07] Yeah, did they lose respect for you that time?
[02:18:10] Well, it's actually funny because life always talks about, you know, me being calm.
[02:18:16] And that's why he laughed so hard.
[02:18:18] We were driving one time, we almost got into car wreck.
[02:18:21] He was driving actually.
[02:18:22] And I'll have him tell the story, but we hit mud and we hit, we were out in the desert.
[02:18:28] We were going for 65 miles an hour on a back road, back by all these farms.
[02:18:33] And it was two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning, something like that.
[02:18:36] And normally these roads are completely dry there in the desert.
[02:18:40] And we're hauling and life's driving, I think he's driving his truck.
[02:18:44] Yeah, he was driving his truck.
[02:18:45] We're hauling and all of a sudden out of nowhere, we see, we see a big 18 wheeler on the side of the road,
[02:18:53] on the opposite side of the road, but it's an arrow road.
[02:18:55] Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:55] And as we're hauling all of a sudden, we hit a water.
[02:19:01] Like a water probably a couple inches deep of water.
[02:19:05] Yeah, mud because it's what happened.
[02:19:07] Somewhere irrigation from all this farmland had broken and there was this flood.
[02:19:13] And so we hit this thing and we're immediately hydropel.
[02:19:16] And and life is from Texas.
[02:19:18] Life is from Texas.
[02:19:20] So he did not use to driving in the snow.
[02:19:22] I grew up driving in the snow in New England.
[02:19:23] You know, you just deal with it.
[02:19:25] Everyone's like a rally driver up there.
[02:19:26] Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
[02:19:27] And so and so life, he's not really used to this.
[02:19:31] And he starts to oversteer the car, which is really, really bad.
[02:19:35] Yeah.
[02:19:36] And you know, I'm sitting there and we're going 65 miles an hour.
[02:19:37] He he he he he's Floody would he tells the story too.
[02:19:40] Because he's like we we thought we were going to die.
[02:19:42] He thought he's like we were definitely going to die.
[02:19:44] Yeah.
[02:19:45] And I'm sitting there in the passenger seat and I say, uh, don't oversteer.
[02:19:48] Don't oversteer.
[02:19:49] No breaks.
[02:19:50] No breaks.
[02:19:51] All right, you're good.
[02:19:52] Because that's the other thing mistake you can make.
[02:19:53] If you jam on the brakes.
[02:19:54] Yeah.
[02:19:55] You're going to lock it up and you're going to slide.
[02:19:56] You're going to lose control.
[02:19:58] So I just don't don't oversteer.
[02:19:59] Don't oversteer.
[02:20:00] No breaks.
[02:20:01] No breaks.
[02:20:02] All right, you're good.
[02:20:04] So that was not my reaction when I got down the phone by the lizard.
[02:20:07] Ah.
[02:20:08] It was hilarious.
[02:20:10] Yeah.
[02:20:11] Thank you.
[02:20:12] It's all good.
[02:20:14] But hey, man, you know, if you want to support this podcast, I will just talk about that.
[02:20:22] Impossible.
[02:20:23] Do it.
[02:20:24] So one good way and support this is the, well, okay, this is what it is.
[02:20:27] Origin right, origin the brand.
[02:20:30] Origin main.com.
[02:20:31] That's what I've said.
[02:20:32] A lot of cool stuff.
[02:20:34] One of the cool items actually there's a bunch of our keys for GJ2.
[02:20:39] I remember back when, um, kind of won't be for a started this thing.
[02:20:44] That would be the main question about GJ2.
[02:20:46] Oh, yeah.
[02:20:47] And I mean, I've been like, oh, yeah, there's these and I give them the three.
[02:20:51] The top actually there was four of them.
[02:20:53] And it was shortly after where you recommended these origin ones.
[02:20:59] And then when I went there, I was like, oh, shoot, this is kind of expensive.
[02:21:02] I don't know, you know, but then I just looked at the one that was like, it was like the
[02:21:06] first one I saw.
[02:21:07] But there are many varying prices of keys.
[02:21:14] And they're all good, by the way.
[02:21:15] I know this because I have some.
[02:21:18] Nonetheless, if you're still wondering what kind of key to get origin G, 100% you have, um,
[02:21:26] options, you know, as far as pricing and stuff like that.
[02:21:29] If you want to T-Lock's one versus the more basic one, but they're all dope.
[02:21:32] And here's the thing about them.
[02:21:35] They're all made in America and not in the sense where they're just kind of assembled
[02:21:40] in America, but the, you know, the materials of source somewhere else, the materials are
[02:21:46] sourced.
[02:21:47] Would you call them sourced?
[02:21:48] Because the raw material comes from the sea, or the sea, or the sea, or the sea, or the sea,
[02:21:53] or the sea, or the sea, or the sea.
[02:21:54] So I'm wearing it.
[02:21:55] Here America.
[02:21:56] I know that.
[02:21:57] America.
[02:21:58] It's brought over to Maine, assembled, or wouldn't not loom.
[02:22:04] Yeah, that's not appropriate.
[02:22:05] Yeah, woven on a loom, boom into this outstanding material, moisture.
[02:22:12] What do you call it?
[02:22:13] Weakling, weakling.
[02:22:14] That's when it kind of like helps with moisture.
[02:22:18] I didn't know all this by the way.
[02:22:19] I'm like being educated on it.
[02:22:21] And there's lots to know, by the way.
[02:22:23] And I, and time microbial, that's a big deal.
[02:22:28] Anyway, or do you mean dot com?
[02:22:30] That's where you get school stuff.
[02:22:31] There's other stuff too, like rashguards.
[02:22:33] And even like clothes, regular clothes, athletic wear.
[02:22:36] It's dope.
[02:22:37] Anyway, all made America in America, boom.
[02:22:40] Also, for some legitimate fitness care on it.
[02:22:45] Dot com slash jockel.
[02:22:47] I just got the, I know, I'm into kettlebells.
[02:22:49] I know I said that before.
[02:22:50] I'm going to say it again.
[02:22:52] What is yours?
[02:22:53] What is your heaviest kettlebell?
[02:22:54] I don't even have 40 kilograms.
[02:22:56] Right.
[02:22:57] So 88 pounds.
[02:22:58] Okay.
[02:22:59] Mine's 90.
[02:23:00] By the way.
[02:23:01] I have two of them.
[02:23:03] Do you only have one?
[02:23:04] I only have one.
[02:23:05] I only have one currently.
[02:23:06] I have, all right.
[02:23:07] Well, she would, I guess, you know, it's clear what I got to do.
[02:23:10] Maybe I'll get another one.
[02:23:11] Step it up.
[02:23:12] But, um, she was, I talking to you about it.
[02:23:15] Oh, yeah, more again.
[02:23:16] You know, more again.
[02:23:17] Yeah.
[02:23:18] Right.
[02:23:19] We're talking about kettlebell.
[02:23:20] Or against the Morgan's feeling strong.
[02:23:21] I told him that yesterday.
[02:23:22] Yeah.
[02:23:23] Not just because that's.
[02:23:24] It's kind of an insult in G.J.2.
[02:23:27] Yeah.
[02:23:28] Right.
[02:23:29] It's like, hey, you feel really strong.
[02:23:30] It's an insult.
[02:23:31] Yeah.
[02:23:32] But I, I made it perfectly clear yesterday.
[02:23:34] I was like, hey, you feel jujitsu strong.
[02:23:37] I said, it's not, I'm not trying to say you feel strong.
[02:23:40] Like, hey, you're a meathead.
[02:23:42] Right.
[02:23:43] But you feel strong in a positive way.
[02:23:45] Because, and I said, here's the deal.
[02:23:47] If it was just you being strong, then five years ago, when I started training
[02:23:51] here, I'm like, oh, you feel strong.
[02:23:52] I didn't say it then because didn't feel strong.
[02:23:54] You feel strong now that you're jujitsu is getting.
[02:23:56] Yeah.
[02:23:57] Get it better and you're getting more skills.
[02:23:59] Yeah.
[02:24:00] I feel like we got to come up with a different expression or maybe just a modified expression.
[02:24:05] Because some people, yeah, like, they'll, people tell me I'm strong or whatever.
[02:24:10] And after a while, I was like, wait, I felt the same thing that you, you know, one time
[02:24:14] I told you, like, you're strong.
[02:24:16] I thought it was kind of maybe subconsciously.
[02:24:18] I thought it was kind of established that, okay, look, you're really good at jujitsu.
[02:24:23] Yeah.
[02:24:24] I was kind of a given. So if I were to tell you, you're strong, it'd be kind of like,
[02:24:28] I like rebut, yeah.
[02:24:29] Was I like, oh yeah.
[02:24:30] I was like, we're like, no, my technique.
[02:24:32] You're like, no, my technique.
[02:24:33] I was like, yeah, no, no, I know that.
[02:24:34] I know your technique is outstanding.
[02:24:36] I got to sense it.
[02:24:37] Yeah, a little bit, not in an angry way or nothing like that.
[02:24:39] But yeah, yeah, I'm falling in actually.
[02:24:41] I'm surprised that I wasn't a little bit more sarcastic about it.
[02:24:45] See, okay, which means, I got surprised.
[02:24:47] I didn't say, yeah, I'm glad I'm so strong.
[02:24:50] Yeah.
[02:24:51] That I can just, you know what I straight away you like that.
[02:24:53] I know people don't mean it.
[02:24:54] I know they don't mean that.
[02:24:55] You know what, how we take it, kind of like, you're strong.
[02:24:58] Yeah.
[02:24:59] It's your physical strength, not your jujitsu technique.
[02:25:01] That's what we take it as.
[02:25:03] Yeah.
[02:25:03] And they're just throwing it in like, how, essentially, how I did with you is kind of like,
[02:25:07] look, you're better than jujitsu than me.
[02:25:09] You beat me up all the time.
[02:25:10] But in the disadvantage.
[02:25:11] You're pretty strong too.
[02:25:13] Yeah, that's probably what people are saying most of the time.
[02:25:17] But so when people be like, dang, you're strong.
[02:25:20] You're great.
[02:25:21] You, when they say you're strong, I say, yeah, I lift a lot of weight.
[02:25:24] So it kind of gives them the impression kind of like, yeah, I might weight lifting basically beats your jujitsu kind of thing.
[02:25:29] And that's a more of an insult, you know, kind of thing.
[02:25:31] Oh, brother.
[02:25:32] It's, it's a joke, really.
[02:25:34] No.
[02:25:35] Nonetheless.
[02:25:36] So, yes, Morgan, he's strong.
[02:25:39] Jujitsu strong.
[02:25:40] Jujitsu strong.
[02:25:41] So he's technique is strong.
[02:25:42] So that means his technique is getting better and it reveals.
[02:25:45] Right.
[02:25:46] It can deliver the strength in the proper way.
[02:25:48] Yeah.
[02:25:49] Yeah.
[02:25:49] That's good job.
[02:25:50] Morgan.
[02:25:50] But we were talking about kettlebells.
[02:25:51] Yeah.
[02:25:52] And he was like, bro, kettlebells are hard.
[02:25:53] So I started to feel kind of good.
[02:25:55] Because I got this 90 pound one and I was like, I lifted it up and you know, okay, you know,
[02:25:59] this, the one hand boom, clean, what do you clean press?
[02:26:02] Is there if you use your legs?
[02:26:05] If you use your legs to snap it up there a little bit.
[02:26:07] Yes, that's the cleaner jerk.
[02:26:08] Okay.
[02:26:09] You didn't want to ask.
[02:26:10] If you just do, if you don't use any legs and you just power it up smoothly, that's a press.
[02:26:14] Okay.
[02:26:15] So my, it's clean and jerk.
[02:26:16] Yeah.
[02:26:16] I just use the whole kind of body, whatever.
[02:26:19] So my met cons they do when I got the wearable funds, those are like 62 pounds.
[02:26:25] I do two at a time.
[02:26:26] Boom.
[02:26:27] Okay.
[02:26:28] Easy.
[02:26:29] And you do reps, you know, it's a whole thing.
[02:26:31] So I got this, the gorilla one, 72 pounds.
[02:26:34] And I could do that one.
[02:26:36] Just as you get strong, you know.
[02:26:37] So I get the 90 pound one and I'm like, I only got one too.
[02:26:40] So I don't know.
[02:26:41] Do you think two at one time is easier?
[02:26:42] Because of the balance, right?
[02:26:43] No, it's not easier.
[02:26:44] Just, I mean, you're using more energy for sure.
[02:26:47] But as far as like doing the balance, it's like not easier.
[02:26:50] Yeah. Okay.
[02:26:51] Well, so one is easier.
[02:26:53] One is for sure.
[02:26:54] Okay.
[02:26:55] Well, okay.
[02:26:56] Gotcha.
[02:26:57] So I got one big foot that's 90 pounds.
[02:26:59] And I lifted that up.
[02:27:00] I was like, man, I'm not.
[02:27:02] Okay.
[02:27:03] Okay.
[02:27:04] And so it was like maybe two, three days later, I was like, well, I got to try that's the, you know, like, the 72 pound one. I can do that.
[02:27:12] You know, a bunch of times actually.
[02:27:14] But so I just warmed up a bunch and just, first time I did it, like, I straight up failed. I couldn't do it.
[02:27:20] And I was like, all right, all right, I know how it feels now and all this stuff.
[02:27:23] And then I could do it.
[02:27:24] Boom, both sides.
[02:27:25] So you're good.
[02:27:26] It's boom.
[02:27:26] Yeah.
[02:27:27] That's good.
[02:27:27] So I'll let.
[02:27:28] Glad we all know that now.
[02:27:30] Yep.
[02:27:30] Hey, hey, got, you know, it's relevant.
[02:27:32] Just say actually, which is actually what makes kettlebells kind of fun to do is because it does require legitimate technique.
[02:27:40] Yeah.
[02:27:41] You can't say it like it's hard. It's like a dumbbell or a barbell or a machine. Well, if you're doing barbell snatches, it takes a hell of a ton of time.
[02:27:50] And that's really the spectrum.
[02:27:52] You know, so if you go like kettlebell and dumb, because dumbbells are straight up balanced.
[02:27:56] I mean, they're not, but they're not like a pretty, but they have a handle both sides of the handle equal amount of weight.
[02:28:01] You know, boom, you just have to balance your body and then after you get that balance down is pretty easy.
[02:28:06] Or a bell even less because you don't have two sides got to be balanced. It's just one long thing. Then two sides of that is balanced.
[02:28:12] Then you go machine, you don't even need balance. You just need this strength to push. So it's that spectrum to the kettlebell.
[02:28:18] It's a way on this side of the spectrum where it kind of, there's the game within the game, you know, this will make some more fun.
[02:28:24] I think you see progress in both areas technique and strength.
[02:28:29] Anyway, we'll leave it at that.
[02:28:31] If you want the cool kettlebells on it dot com slash chuckle or jump ropes battle maces.
[02:28:39] The way, do you call them battle maces or just maces?
[02:28:42] Yeah, those are going to clubs.
[02:28:44] Yeah, though, you can get some cool workouts with that and they do like your forearms get.
[02:28:50] I didn't look into like what exactly, you know, they're going to improve, but I know course strength and all this stuff, but there's all these little things they improve too.
[02:29:00] How's Danny's stuff?
[02:29:02] Also, good way to support if you're going to get this book men at how do you pronounce good the place?
[02:29:10] Or name, or name, or name, or name, or name, or name, Jeffrey Powell.
[02:29:15] That's how I pronounce it anyway.
[02:29:16] Some of apologize to anyone that's from Holland.
[02:29:19] Yeah.
[02:29:20] And pronounce it a different way.
[02:29:21] I looked at it on YouTube and how they said it.
[02:29:23] And it was like, they say, oh, how do pronounce our name?
[02:29:26] And there's 14 different ways to say it. So I just rolled the dice and picked one that sounded easiest for me to say.
[02:29:33] So sorry if I'm saying it wrong.
[02:29:36] Yeah, man, no, all good.
[02:29:38] But if you want to get that book or any other book that jokery using the website, just go to jokopodcast.com.
[02:29:48] On the top menu there, click on books from episodes.
[02:29:52] All the books are listed there by episode.
[02:29:55] Along with the few other things, but mainly just the books,
[02:29:58] by episode you click through their boom, takes you to Amazon.
[02:30:01] Get those books there. That's a good way to support.
[02:30:04] That's the Amazon click through.
[02:30:06] Or if you're doing the other shopping, if you're getting a tripod or a video camera or dotting or whatever.
[02:30:13] Click through their boom. That's a good way to support. Great way to support.
[02:30:17] Also, a little addition there.
[02:30:19] You know how we had the website, jokopodcast2.com.
[02:30:24] That's a long story. I think I went into it.
[02:30:26] It was like when I was like testing like what website provider whatever.
[02:30:30] I was like let me get this one because what if I'm attached it and it's a long story.
[02:30:34] And then, so we ended up getting jokopodcast.com and they're both kind of there.
[02:30:39] But jokopodcast2 is kind of the primary one.
[02:30:43] It's not the primary one anymore.
[02:30:46] Jokopodcast.
[02:30:47] It's jokopodcast.com.
[02:30:49] Okay.
[02:30:50] So that's the website.
[02:30:51] And that was actually a trooper that straight up got us jokopodcast.
[02:30:54] You know, you're looking out for us.
[02:30:56] Yeah.
[02:30:56] Because in then that's a big deal.
[02:30:57] Sound of New York.
[02:30:58] Good dude.
[02:30:59] Yeah.
[02:30:59] That's a huge deal because like, do you have your own name?
[02:31:04] Yeah.
[02:31:05] Okay.
[02:31:05] So people will be like, oh, this guy's blowing up.
[02:31:08] They'll go and they'll buy the domain name either.
[02:31:10] Hold onto it or immediately go to you and be like, hey, you want to buy this for me?
[02:31:14] Yeah.
[02:31:15] They told it a hostage.
[02:31:16] Yeah.
[02:31:16] In fact, I think there might be like a legal like defense against it.
[02:31:20] Like if someone gets your name or your your kids name and you're kind of a public for your
[02:31:25] I think I'm not sure.
[02:31:27] But yeah, that's what people do meant.
[02:31:28] They'll or they'll buy a bunch of domain names that sound cool.
[02:31:31] Yeah.
[02:31:32] They'll be like, yeah.
[02:31:34] You can buy this for me.
[02:31:35] Kind of thing.
[02:31:36] It's super whack when they do it with like Euro.
[02:31:38] You know, when they know like that's your company.
[02:31:40] You have to be had for a long time.
[02:31:42] They, I don't know what they've paid for.
[02:31:44] Eventually paid for UFC dot com.
[02:31:46] But for a long time, they were like UFC dot TV and all these.
[02:31:49] Yeah.
[02:31:50] They had to step up.
[02:31:51] I bet you they bet somebody made a lot of money off that one.
[02:31:54] Yeah.
[02:31:55] You see, especially the three letters.
[02:31:57] Yes.
[02:31:58] Like if you get the last letter.
[02:31:59] That's a lot of money.
[02:32:00] Crazy Tom.
[02:32:01] Nonetheless, but yeah, jacobadcast dot com.
[02:32:03] That's the main website.
[02:32:04] No.
[02:32:05] If you were going to jacobadcast too dot com, it's it's not that anymore.
[02:32:09] Does that send you the over?
[02:32:10] It does did.
[02:32:12] But while I'm switching, I'm doing this thing.
[02:32:14] It will eventually.
[02:32:15] It will eventually.
[02:32:16] But if you run into that, that's why people have been hitting me up.
[02:32:21] And rightly so.
[02:32:23] Thanks for that.
[02:32:24] So yeah, nonetheless, back to the point, if you want to support and by getting these books
[02:32:28] go through the website and click through there, it's a good way to support.
[02:32:32] Smoo action.
[02:32:33] Huge reaction.
[02:32:34] Small.
[02:32:35] Huge.
[02:32:36] That's what it works.
[02:32:37] Also subscribe to the podcast.
[02:32:39] iTunes.
[02:32:40] If you haven't already.
[02:32:42] Stitcher.
[02:32:43] If you don't use IOS.
[02:32:45] Google play.
[02:32:47] Any anywhere they will where they provide podcasts.
[02:32:50] Boom, we're on there.
[02:32:51] So subscribe.
[02:32:52] That's a good way.
[02:32:53] Also YouTube.
[02:32:54] Yes, I put some excerpts on there.
[02:32:56] More excerpts.
[02:32:57] I'm going to continue to do so.
[02:32:59] Shareable excerpts.
[02:33:00] Try to keep them under four minutes.
[02:33:02] That's cool right?
[02:33:03] Yeah.
[02:33:04] Might be a little long.
[02:33:05] But everyone's in a while.
[02:33:06] You get it like a good like 10 minute one.
[02:33:08] Pressure thing.
[02:33:09] Yeah.
[02:33:10] But they're more sure better than two.
[02:33:11] That's a long thing.
[02:33:12] Think about the videos that you want to get compression three minutes four minutes tops.
[02:33:17] Yeah.
[02:33:18] And it depends on the, you should edit them maybe.
[02:33:20] Like make them shorter.
[02:33:22] Yeah.
[02:33:23] Yeah.
[02:33:24] I mean, if it's appropriate because sometimes you don't want it.
[02:33:28] Sometimes it's just you saying like a whole thing.
[02:33:31] And it's like, okay, that's solid.
[02:33:33] And sometimes it's you.
[02:33:34] And then my rebuttal to kind of kind of bolster the point your point because you'll
[02:33:39] clarify it because I, you know.
[02:33:41] And it's all it's, it makes sense.
[02:33:43] So sometimes if you edit certain things out, maybe the message isn't there.
[02:33:47] Sure.
[02:33:48] Much as much as you should be.
[02:33:49] Not all the time.
[02:33:50] Not all the time.
[02:33:51] But most of the time.
[02:33:52] Nonetheless, I'll look into it about that.
[02:33:54] Ideally, if a video and this goes along with like people's typical attention span,
[02:34:02] it should be what?
[02:34:04] Like about a minute and a half.
[02:34:06] I don't know about my attention span.
[02:34:07] It's getting tested right now.
[02:34:09] But I support you.
[02:34:11] Just saying, this is important stuff we need to go over this.
[02:34:15] So we can come to the best conclusion on how to conduct ourselves in regards to YouTube
[02:34:21] excerpts and other things.
[02:34:23] Nonetheless, subscribe to YouTube channel.
[02:34:25] It's good.
[02:34:26] We're going to provide value.
[02:34:28] How about that?
[02:34:29] No.
[02:34:30] Also, if you're into the video version because some people are.
[02:34:35] Some people are into more the video version of the podcast.
[02:34:38] Yeah.
[02:34:39] You know, boom, subscribe.
[02:34:40] If you haven't already.
[02:34:41] YouTube.
[02:34:42] Also, jockelas is a store.
[02:34:45] It's called jockels store.
[02:34:47] Jockels.com.
[02:34:48] If you didn't already know, on there we got some cool stuff.
[02:34:51] Shirts mainly.
[02:34:52] Some rashguards.
[02:34:53] I just made an order for hoodies.
[02:34:55] Thicker.
[02:34:56] Have here.
[02:34:57] Fall is coming.
[02:34:59] Are we in fall right now?
[02:35:00] The first day of fall is like the other day.
[02:35:03] We're in fall.
[02:35:04] Yeah.
[02:35:05] So we got some not that we're doing a whole seasonal thing.
[02:35:07] I'm just saying it's fall now getting cool.
[02:35:11] Getting cooler.
[02:35:12] Check.
[02:35:13] Got some hoodies on there.
[02:35:14] Got some rashguards on there.
[02:35:16] I think I'm going to do a warrior kid rashguard.
[02:35:20] I have one.
[02:35:21] Yeah.
[02:35:22] No.
[02:35:23] But it's not in production.
[02:35:25] Yeah.
[02:35:26] And it's not.
[02:35:27] I'm going to change it a little bit.
[02:35:28] Some coloring stuff and whatever.
[02:35:30] But it is pretty cool.
[02:35:31] Good.
[02:35:32] Good little.
[02:35:33] Pre-response.
[02:35:34] Also hats on there.
[02:35:36] And some other cool stuff.
[02:35:37] I'm not saying get something.
[02:35:38] I'm saying go on there.
[02:35:40] Check it out.
[02:35:42] If you want to support and you want to get something, you think something is cool.
[02:35:47] For yourself or for your, you know, friend, girlfriend, neighbor, whoever.
[02:35:53] Then get something.
[02:35:54] Good way to support.
[02:35:55] Actually, great way to support.
[02:35:57] Also psychological warfare.
[02:35:59] Okay.
[02:36:00] What psychological warfare is if you don't know, it's an album with jockel tracks.
[02:36:05] So basically, if you're on your campaign against weakness and you have a moment of weakness,
[02:36:13] this is like a little spot.
[02:36:14] So basically, you put on these audio tracks to let you know, hey, pragmatically, don't skip this
[02:36:22] work out today.
[02:36:23] Hey, don't slip on this diet today.
[02:36:25] Hey, your procrastination isn't working.
[02:36:28] And here's why.
[02:36:29] But it's jockel telling you.
[02:36:30] So it's kind of like more effective way more effective.
[02:36:34] 100% success rate in my experience.
[02:36:38] 100%
[02:36:39] Best legit.
[02:36:40] Hey, also jockel,
[02:36:43] why, if you want it, you can get that on Amazon.
[02:36:44] It tastes good and it makes you feel good.
[02:36:47] Also, on originmain.com, you can get jocco, super curl.
[02:36:53] Criollo, that will make you feel good.
[02:36:56] And on top of that, you can get jocco joint warfare, which is awesome.
[02:37:02] What's in that, by the way?
[02:37:04] It's glucosamine,
[02:37:07] control goes the main, the main, but then we put some additional things in there.
[02:37:12] Yeah, and it's it's been rocking.
[02:37:14] It's it's it's awesome.
[02:37:17] You've got books or I've got some books.
[02:37:20] If you want to read them, one is called Way the Warrior Kid.
[02:37:23] One is called Extreme Ownership.
[02:37:25] The Warrior Kid book is for kids.
[02:37:27] Extreme ownership is for people and leadership positions or people that want to be in leadership positions.
[02:37:31] There's also a new book coming out called Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual.
[02:37:35] It actually comes out October 17th.
[02:37:37] And at one point, many months ago, October 17th seemed like it was a long way as a way,
[02:37:42] but it's not anymore.
[02:37:44] It's here.
[02:37:45] So you can order that one.
[02:37:46] It is unlike any book that you have ever seen or read.
[02:37:50] Also, what's interesting about this book is people keep asking me if it's going to be unaudible.
[02:37:54] It's not going to be unaudible.
[02:37:56] Instead of being unaudible, it is going to be un iTunes.
[02:37:59] It's going to be on Amazon MP3.
[02:38:02] It's going to be on Google Play.
[02:38:05] It's going to be where you can find MP3 tracks.
[02:38:09] There's a reason for this.
[02:38:10] If you do it through audible, you get this one big, long book.
[02:38:15] And what the book is, the way the book is written, it's written to be chunked up.
[02:38:20] And you're going to want to take parts of it and play it at certain times.
[02:38:24] More like you would do with the psychological warfare album.
[02:38:27] So people are asking for more psychological warfare.
[02:38:30] That's what we're doing.
[02:38:31] Discipline and go to freedom field manual.
[02:38:32] It's going to be available as an album that you can buy.
[02:38:35] And then you can do what you want with the track.
[02:38:37] You can make them your alarm ringtone.
[02:38:39] You can listen to them out of order in any order.
[02:38:41] You can put them in a mix.
[02:38:43] You can do a lot more stuff with them.
[02:38:44] That's why we're doing it as an album with tracks instead of as an audible book.
[02:38:51] So you know what?
[02:38:52] We might, you know, people might have a little challenge finding it or realizing,
[02:38:56] you know, when they go on an Amazon or they go on a Barnes and Noble,
[02:38:59] they won't see that it's available.
[02:39:01] They'll be looking for the audible and you won't be able to find it.
[02:39:04] I'm sorry.
[02:39:05] We'll just in the audible, I think that's where they won't find it.
[02:39:08] You don't be able to find it in the audible platform.
[02:39:10] Right.
[02:39:11] We're not being there.
[02:39:12] But it'll be on Amazon just a little bit on Amazon.
[02:39:13] But you, I don't think it'll be linked in to the same thing where you go,
[02:39:18] oh, here it is.
[02:39:19] I think it's going to be hidden.
[02:39:20] It's going to be hard to find.
[02:39:21] Kind of like a tart to find on iTunes.
[02:39:22] It's hard to find psychological warfare.
[02:39:24] But the question is, do you want to do, did I want to do something right or just do something easy?
[02:39:29] Yeah, that's true.
[02:39:30] Because the, the field manual, like any field manual, like when you want to go refer to it,
[02:39:35] you don't want to be searching around.
[02:39:37] Yeah, it's really not.
[02:39:38] Yeah, it's really not.
[02:39:39] You mean like, okay, what is that one part, you know, that deals with this and you,
[02:39:42] boom, you can just go to the, you just look for a track name in there.
[02:39:45] So like I said, we could have done the easy thing and, and whatever,
[02:39:49] you know, had everyone just be able to click on it really easy.
[02:39:51] I'm, I apologize, but if you want the right way, then that's what I had to do.
[02:39:55] So that's that book.
[02:39:57] And then echelon front, that's the leadership consulting company that I have with
