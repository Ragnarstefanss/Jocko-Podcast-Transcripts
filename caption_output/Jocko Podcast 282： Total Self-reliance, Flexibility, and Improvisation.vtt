00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 282 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.28
A 44-year-old, what man was among those involved in a three-day fight recently as part of Operation

3
00:00:16.28 --> 00:00:25.48
Adelboro in Vietnam? He is Charles F. Wittis, who is stationed at Fort Sill until June with

4
00:00:25.48 --> 00:00:31.72
the fourth battalion, 30th Infantry, and now serves as a platoon sergeant in Vietnam with

5
00:00:31.72 --> 00:00:40.20
company A, 1st Battalion, 27th Entry, Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. The 24-year Army

6
00:00:40.20 --> 00:00:48.60
Veterans' wife, Florence, and children Pat, David Sharon Gary, and Wanda, reside in

7
00:00:48.60 --> 00:00:55.88
Latin. A married daughter lives in Litchfield, Minnesota. Operation Adelboro was not the first

8
00:00:55.88 --> 00:01:03.08
time sergeant Wittis has seen action. As he served with the first Infantry Division during

9
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:11.000
World War II and saw action in North Africa, Sicily, the Normandy invasion, France, Belgium,

10
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.56
Luxembourg, German-Nee, and Chexlovakia.

11
00:01:17.56 --> 00:01:23.64
So he had some combat experience. He also served in Korea with the Intelligence and Reconnaissance

12
00:01:23.64 --> 00:01:29.36
Platoon of the 19th Infantry Regiment 24th Infantry Division. Operation Adelboro has been

13
00:01:29.36 --> 00:01:35.80
described as the biggest US action of the Vietnam War. The 43-day operation involves some

14
00:01:35.80 --> 00:01:43.12
25,000 American soldiers in the jungles of Tainin province northwest of Sagan. A cracked

15
00:01:43.12 --> 00:01:48.88
open on the toughest and oldest of the Hong Kong strongholds. The campaign ended last

16
00:01:48.88 --> 00:01:57.04
Saturday with a claimed bag of more than 1,100 communist regulars killed and nearly 2400

17
00:01:57.04 --> 00:02:02.64
tons of rice captured plus hordes of other supplies.

18
00:02:02.64 --> 00:02:08.24
I don't think that the fighting out there was as bad as in itself as either World War II

19
00:02:08.24 --> 00:02:15.36
or Korea, but this was much more confusing. In Korea, you at least had lines over here.

20
00:02:15.36 --> 00:02:21.68
They were all around you. Sergeant Wittis said, at first I thought we'd run into a platoon

21
00:02:21.68 --> 00:02:26.88
on patrol. But when the fighting continued, I knew we'd run into a much stronger force.

22
00:02:27.76 --> 00:02:32.48
I don't really have time to think about what was going on. My time was spent getting wounded

23
00:02:32.48 --> 00:02:38.88
out and getting the ammo to the men. Those assaults were the first I'd seen since Korea.

24
00:02:40.16 --> 00:02:46.000
They were just the same type that we called Banzai attacks. Our men were outstanding.

25
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:50.24
As good as any I saw in World War II or Korea.

26
00:02:52.64 --> 00:03:01.12
End quote. Another taking part in the operation was PFC John Cosserato of Linhurst, New Jersey,

27
00:03:01.12 --> 00:03:08.64
who received his baptism of fire on those three days. Up to that combat action, his combat

28
00:03:08.64 --> 00:03:14.08
experience had been a short sweep during which his unit received a little sniper fire.

29
00:03:17.44 --> 00:03:23.36
I remember the firing was very heavy for a while and then it stopped. He said,

30
00:03:23.36 --> 00:03:29.44
I thought it was over. I'd heard that they hit you and ran, but it was far from over.

31
00:03:29.44 --> 00:03:34.56
We were too busy with the wounded to really think about what was happening. The biggest thing I

32
00:03:34.56 --> 00:03:40.32
remembered was the sun. It seemed like I couldn't get any place where it was cool enough to think straight.

33
00:03:42.64 --> 00:03:48.96
It was worse than I had imagined combat to be. There was a feeling of helplessness. The bullets were

34
00:03:48.96 --> 00:03:55.52
flying around us and we couldn't see who was shooting them. I really respect the medics.

35
00:03:55.52 --> 00:04:00.96
They were right out there in the middle of it. It was a good feeling to know that if you get wounded,

36
00:04:00.96 --> 00:04:09.28
those guys will come and help you. After it was all over, that night I realized what I went through.

37
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:17.12
You wonder why you are alive when a lot of other people are gone.

38
00:04:17.12 --> 00:04:33.04
That's a newspaper article from 1966 from out there in Laughton, Oklahoma. It's talking about

39
00:04:33.04 --> 00:04:38.16
Operation Adelboro, which is mentioned a few times in the article. The operations named after

40
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:47.68
Adelboro Massachusetts, where the 196th light infantry brigade had been reactivated out of four

41
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:55.36
devins mass chusets. The 196th initiated this operation after they had only been in country for about two months.

42
00:04:58.56 --> 00:05:03.84
I would say this newspaper article paints the battle in a very positive picture, but it was a rough

43
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:12.000
battle, very rough battle. The brigade commander was an inexperienced guy. He was an inexperienced

44
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.28
infighting infantry. He didn't really prioritize next cue. Laugh some control at various points

45
00:05:21.28 --> 00:05:28.56
in the battle of what was happening. And in the end, even though as reported, there was over a

46
00:05:28.56 --> 00:05:35.84
thousand enemy kill, there was also some significant loss on the American side. 155 men killed and

47
00:05:35.84 --> 00:05:45.76
five missing from the first fourth and 25th infantry divisions. And the 196th. And I couldn't pin this

48
00:05:45.76 --> 00:05:50.72
down. I believe there was four medals of honor that were awarded for actions during this battle.

49
00:05:50.72 --> 00:06:03.84
And it was the largest series of air mobile operations at that time. And it was also a baptism of fire.

50
00:06:03.84 --> 00:06:10.56
As I mentioned, for the 196th light infantry out of out of four devins mass chusets. And

51
00:06:11.92 --> 00:06:16.56
as I was reading about this battle, I started thinking about that idea of light infantry. And

52
00:06:16.56 --> 00:06:24.16
just doing some reading, doing some research. And I came across a document that I thought was worth

53
00:06:24.16 --> 00:06:32.80
discussing. The document is called Proverbs of the Light Infantry, which out of the gate, you know,

54
00:06:32.80 --> 00:06:41.92
I'm kind of already thinking, this is going to be good to go. To written by a guy named Major Scott

55
00:06:41.92 --> 00:06:48.56
or Mick Michael, he's an army officer. And not only is he a military guy, obviously being in the army,

56
00:06:48.56 --> 00:06:55.60
being a major in the army, but he's also written a bunch historically speaking on light infantry,

57
00:06:55.60 --> 00:07:02.32
specifically wrote a book called a historical perspective on light infantry. He wrote another book

58
00:07:02.32 --> 00:07:08.80
called Stumbling Bear, Soviet military performance in Afghanistan. So he's got, you know,

59
00:07:08.80 --> 00:07:12.96
like I said, the military background. He's also got this historical background, which I think

60
00:07:12.96 --> 00:07:20.32
served him well and put in together this bunch of Proverbs, which were published in a magazine

61
00:07:20.96 --> 00:07:28.96
that I was lucky enough to find. So let's check out this document. Starts off history,

62
00:07:28.96 --> 00:07:34.72
provides many examples that could help define contemporary concepts. Here's an attempt to define

63
00:07:34.72 --> 00:07:41.44
the generic light infantry and suggest possible training tasks, Proverbs of the Light Infantry.

64
00:07:42.24 --> 00:07:47.68
By Major Scott or Mick Michael, US Army. So there's an article which I'll go through quickly.

65
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.08
What exactly does Army mean by the term light infantry? What is the difference between light

66
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:59.12
infantry and regular infantry? He is light infantry merely regular, regular infantry made light

67
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:03.36
by stripping away a heavy equipment and vehicles or is it something quite different in terms of

68
00:08:03.36 --> 00:08:10.32
tactical style attitudes and utility? And this is what hit me is, look, when I, when I do these,

69
00:08:10.32 --> 00:08:16.72
when I, when I look at something, when I read something, if I'm thinking it's strict military

70
00:08:16.72 --> 00:08:22.64
information, then I'll save it for when I go and talk to military troops. However, much of the time,

71
00:08:22.64 --> 00:08:30.16
what you find is that military information, military knowledge, military proverbs in this place,

72
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:36.000
are something that you can take and apply to absolutely anything in life. So when he's talking

73
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.96
about light infantry, it sounds super specific. It's a lot more broad. These things can be applied,

74
00:08:42.96 --> 00:08:49.28
a lot more broadly. Back to the book, serving the official literature on the light division.

75
00:08:49.28 --> 00:08:54.40
One is hard put to avoid the conclusion that our Army leadership is taking the view that light

76
00:08:54.40 --> 00:08:59.28
infantry is nothing more than regular infantry made light for the purpose. For the overwriting

77
00:08:59.28 --> 00:09:05.04
purpose of strategic mobility, a number of facts support this conclusion. First, the initial design

78
00:09:05.04 --> 00:09:12.08
parameters for the division focused on restrictions, on size, not operational employment.

79
00:09:12.08 --> 00:09:16.40
The forced designers of the new light division labored under three basic parameters.

80
00:09:17.20 --> 00:09:24.32
One, a 10,000 man personnel ceiling, to a deployability limit of 500 or less,

81
00:09:24.32 --> 00:09:31.12
C141 sorties and three a requirement for the division to have nine battalion maneuver elements.

82
00:09:31.12 --> 00:09:36.72
So what he's saying there is, when they made this thing, what they base it off of is they

83
00:09:36.72 --> 00:09:42.48
wanted to be able to deploy this thing rapidly. You know, only 500 flights of C141, which is actually

84
00:09:42.48 --> 00:09:48.16
a lot of flies. But you know, you're going to get 10,000 people deployed in a short amount of time.

85
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:53.44
Okay, so that's what they're looking to do. But he goes on a little bit. I'm going to skip ahead a

86
00:09:53.44 --> 00:10:00.40
little bit. There's more, there should be more to it. It shouldn't be just a little bit lighter.

87
00:10:00.40 --> 00:10:03.44
That shouldn't be the goal of light infantry. There should be some differences as well.

88
00:10:04.88 --> 00:10:09.60
He says certainly the army has not ignored the peculiar tactical characteristics of the division.

89
00:10:09.60 --> 00:10:14.48
It has, after all, developed light leaders course and undertaken a multitude of tests and

90
00:10:14.48 --> 00:10:19.92
studies to determine how to fight the division. But the hallmark of the division remains its

91
00:10:19.92 --> 00:10:26.64
strategic lightness, not its tactical lightness. This is an imbalance, not dismiss lightly.

92
00:10:27.28 --> 00:10:33.60
And he literally wrote and here, not upon. So the majors got some, got some comedic chops for

93
00:10:33.60 --> 00:10:39.76
I believe that it shows a lack of appreciation for the real meaning of light infantry. So he's

94
00:10:39.76 --> 00:10:50.72
arguing here that it's not just a regular infantry unit that has less equipment that

95
00:10:50.72 --> 00:10:55.68
have a different attitude and he gets to it here in contrast. And this is why I think this applies.

96
00:10:56.48 --> 00:11:04.000
Because we don't want to think that's so fascinating for instance about GJ2. Is it allow

97
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.48
someone who's smaller and weaker to beat someone that's bigger and stronger? How can you do that

98
00:11:10.48 --> 00:11:20.16
tactics techniques, procedures, strategy, skills? Light infantry, well, light infantry can beat

99
00:11:21.44 --> 00:11:27.76
heavier infantry. How do they do that? The same thing that you use in GJ2. Businesses. Well,

100
00:11:27.76 --> 00:11:31.12
you're in a business, you've got to competitor that's bigger than you and stronger than you.

101
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:36.96
And more capitalized than you are. How can you possibly beat them? That's where I'm going. That's

102
00:11:36.96 --> 00:11:43.60
what we want to know, right? That's why we love the GJ2. Right? So that's why we kind of,

103
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:48.56
we kind of love the light infantry too. And we want to learn from the light infantry. Just like we

104
00:11:48.56 --> 00:11:52.72
learn from GJ2 when we apply it to business, we apply it to life. We can learn from the light infantry

105
00:11:52.72 --> 00:11:57.76
so that we can take advantage. So I'm sure you're going to go into it. But the light infantry

106
00:11:57.76 --> 00:12:07.28
essentially is it's for speed, right? Rapid deploy, rapid deploy ability. Yeah. But it's like where

107
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:13.52
being the speed is more important or is a significant of significant importance in the situation.

108
00:12:13.52 --> 00:12:18.72
So, but with that speed comes certain drawbacks. So they have to apply certain techniques given

109
00:12:18.72 --> 00:12:23.92
those drawbacks. Exactly. How does Jeff Glover tap out echo Charles? Yeah. Can you do it? How does

110
00:12:23.92 --> 00:12:30.08
he tap out Joko? Can he do it because he's bigger and stronger? Can he do it because he's

111
00:12:30.96 --> 00:12:37.20
can apply more force than I can? No. He can out maneuver us. Yeah. He can out maneuver he can move.

112
00:12:37.20 --> 00:12:42.64
He can use his lightness and what else is he have flexibility. And then he has special

113
00:12:42.64 --> 00:12:47.44
little tactics, techniques and procedures that he can use. A little Jeff Glover, like a little monkey

114
00:12:47.44 --> 00:12:56.80
on your back. So here we get into it. In contrast to the general American use of the term

115
00:12:56.80 --> 00:13:02.40
light infantry as regular infantry may light, there exists another interpretation mostly European

116
00:13:02.40 --> 00:13:08.000
and context and origins, which is not tied to for structure or strategic mobility, nearly so

117
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.32
originally as it is in the United States. This article sheds light on this opposing concept and

118
00:13:14.32 --> 00:13:21.92
sites a list of proverbs which characterizes operations by what could be referred to as classic

119
00:13:21.92 --> 00:13:27.52
light infantry. There are three primary characteristics of light infantry which distinguish it

120
00:13:27.52 --> 00:13:36.48
from regular infantry, one an attitude of self-reliance, two a propensity for improvisation and flexibility

121
00:13:36.48 --> 00:13:44.32
three a specific common tactical style. So those are the three things that he's saying are the

122
00:13:44.32 --> 00:13:50.56
true differentiators. The attitude of self-reliance is probably the most significant of the three

123
00:13:50.56 --> 00:13:56.32
attributes since the others are founded on it. Self-reliance is based on high levels of self-confidence,

124
00:13:56.32 --> 00:14:01.84
discipline, trust, unique cohesion and a never say die approach to problems.

125
00:14:01.84 --> 00:14:10.24
A presupposes the possession of highly developed individual skills not usually found in the regular

126
00:14:10.24 --> 00:14:21.52
infantry soldier. So discipline, trust, unique cohesion, the never say die approach to problems,

127
00:14:21.52 --> 00:14:29.12
which I like, but you know leadership and strategy and tactics in that book I talked about

128
00:14:29.12 --> 00:14:35.52
that's good attitude to have. I'm never going to quit but you also need to have the

129
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.36
detachment to take a look at a problem where you're throwing all your resources and not winning

130
00:14:39.36 --> 00:14:43.52
and say you know what I'm going to throw my resources at this problem in a different way.

131
00:14:44.16 --> 00:14:50.40
We don't want to lose the ability to think. We don't want never say die to translate to never think

132
00:14:50.40 --> 00:14:57.92
of another solution to a problem that we're facing. Light infantry, know that no matter what

133
00:14:57.92 --> 00:15:03.36
the situation they can make due by turning the situation to their advantage. Love that.

134
00:15:04.32 --> 00:15:08.72
Oh, there's bad weather. Cool. Watch us. We're going to use that to our advantage.

135
00:15:09.76 --> 00:15:12.56
Oh, there's tough terrain. Great. We're going to use that to our advantage.

136
00:15:15.20 --> 00:15:22.48
Classic light infantry almost distains logistics. A believing that is it is possible to live in

137
00:15:22.48 --> 00:15:28.32
on and off the land and to use the enemy's supplies and weapons if necessary. Self-reliance,

138
00:15:28.32 --> 00:15:35.28
transens, unfavorable circumstances and finds a way to accomplish the mission through innovation,

139
00:15:35.28 --> 00:15:45.36
imagination and perseverance. Distains logistics. We don't even want support. We don't even want a

140
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:48.08
supply chain. We're going to live off the land.

141
00:15:48.08 --> 00:15:54.64
Well, light infantry's attitude of self-reliance leads directly to a propensity for flexibility

142
00:15:54.64 --> 00:16:00.40
and improvisation. The light infantry cannot afford a rigid approach to tactical problems.

143
00:16:00.40 --> 00:16:06.56
So I love that because now we're going back on the fact that we have a never say die attitude.

144
00:16:06.56 --> 00:16:12.32
Guess what? We also can't afford a rigid approach to tactical problems. So we got a good

145
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:15.68
dichotomy that's getting balanced out now. We were a little nervous at first.

146
00:16:15.68 --> 00:16:21.44
Instead, light infantry seeks to respond quickly to change, turning its strengths against the

147
00:16:21.44 --> 00:16:26.56
enemies' weaknesses in ways that the enemy does not expect. Yes, due to it's it.

148
00:16:27.60 --> 00:16:32.08
The light infantry leader improvises to accomplish his mission by changing his tactics and

149
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:41.12
organization whenever necessary. So that's very different from traditional military thought.

150
00:16:41.12 --> 00:16:44.72
Right? Well, we got a different problem. Just change our organization, change our tactics. What do we

151
00:16:44.72 --> 00:16:51.20
got to do? Old equipment is used in new ways and new methods are developed to meet a changing

152
00:16:51.20 --> 00:16:58.56
situation. Light infantry is a light of foot, so to speak, and light and quick of mind as well.

153
00:16:59.76 --> 00:17:02.72
I wouldn't even see as well. I'd say that's probably the predominant

154
00:17:03.44 --> 00:17:08.72
trait that we want. Light of mind, quick of mind.

155
00:17:08.72 --> 00:17:14.80
Amazing how people get entrenched in their own little ideas or their own big ideas.

156
00:17:15.84 --> 00:17:23.76
Yes, sir. Entrenched. Can't move. The light infantry uses improvisation and flexibility as a combat

157
00:17:23.76 --> 00:17:30.48
multiplier thereby frequently achieving a psychological advantage over an enemy which may outman

158
00:17:30.48 --> 00:17:43.28
and outgun it. Oh, so I'm going to someone the other day. I'm hearing him, he's trying,

159
00:17:43.28 --> 00:17:54.96
he's asking me to help him come up with a strategic plan. A, B, C, D, E, F. And he's getting some resistance.

160
00:17:54.96 --> 00:18:01.36
He's got different parts of the team, pulling them in different directions. And he's having a hard

161
00:18:01.36 --> 00:18:06.72
time making a decision of like, well, we could do this, but then if this tap, we could do that,

162
00:18:06.72 --> 00:18:14.40
but then I'm worried about this. So it's a problem. And what I'm sitting there listening to them

163
00:18:14.40 --> 00:18:21.20
and I'm thinking, and I have to play this mental game with myself because the way that you

164
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:29.28
don't find an answer when you're talking to someone is to try so hard to understand what their

165
00:18:29.28 --> 00:18:34.88
perspective is that you become wrapped up in the problem yourself. So I was kind of doing that.

166
00:18:34.88 --> 00:18:38.000
I'm thinking, well, he says, well, you know, this group is saying that we should do this and

167
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.76
this other group is saying that we should do that. And I'm starting to weigh those two groups out and

168
00:18:41.76 --> 00:18:45.52
see what's once, you know, you know, I'm saying so I'm starting I'm getting too close to it.

169
00:18:46.56 --> 00:18:50.08
So I'm listening. So what I have to do is I have to actually play this little game with

170
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:56.56
myself where I say, okay, what would I actually really do if I was in the situation?

171
00:18:58.88 --> 00:19:06.000
And I said, hey, neither one of these groups know what's going to happen and neither do you.

172
00:19:06.80 --> 00:19:13.68
And you right now are trying to make a rigid plan about a future that is unknown to you. Let's

173
00:19:13.68 --> 00:19:21.76
reassess the plan and come up with one that revolves around flexibility and adaptability,

174
00:19:21.76 --> 00:19:29.92
not about not around rigidity. Problem solved. And that's really all that took.

175
00:19:30.88 --> 00:19:34.72
That's really all that took. How can we come up with a more flexible plan?

176
00:19:35.76 --> 00:19:37.44
We don't know, do you know what's going to happen tomorrow?

177
00:19:38.08 --> 00:19:42.56
Okay, so we can come up with a plan, but we want a flexible plan because it you can plan to go to the beach,

178
00:19:42.56 --> 00:19:46.80
but we don't know what the weather's going to be. Yes, kind of like the overpacking thing we talked about

179
00:19:46.80 --> 00:19:52.48
a long time ago where a refresh my memory. You know, like that's why you wind up overpacking because you're

180
00:19:52.48 --> 00:19:57.20
like, what if we do that? What if we do this? What if we do this? What if we go swimming? What if we go

181
00:19:57.20 --> 00:20:01.60
whatever and it's like, you don't know if you're even going to go, you don't even have a plan to go to dinner.

182
00:20:01.60 --> 00:20:05.52
Even though you kind of know you go to dinner sometimes, you know, and then you do that too much.

183
00:20:05.52 --> 00:20:09.60
Right, you're over here over packing. Yeah, I'll let you're Levison, Levison.

184
00:20:09.60 --> 00:20:12.88
Yeah, Levison, but that's the long term. He's had the Iran.

185
00:20:12.88 --> 00:20:18.88
That's some light infantry traveling there. Yes, and he's got a backpack and $8. He might be

186
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:23.52
straight up over light infantry traveling. I was thinking about I was thinking about him

187
00:20:24.32 --> 00:20:29.92
from this perspective, you know, you do so much contingency planning, right? In the military.

188
00:20:29.92 --> 00:20:33.20
What if this happens? What if that happens? He must have been looking at contingency plans. Like,

189
00:20:33.20 --> 00:20:38.72
Oh, no worry, it'll be good. Hopefully not. And that's the key to that's one of the keys to

190
00:20:38.72 --> 00:20:44.64
light infantry. Yeah, flexible planning. Yeah, especially with that approach, you know, so you

191
00:20:44.64 --> 00:20:50.32
you go to, in our case, we'll go to Koi. You need a certain amount of things that you need. You're

192
00:20:50.32 --> 00:20:55.68
going to need like seven. Yeah, like shorts. You just surf shorts. In fact, you get the hybrid shorts.

193
00:20:55.68 --> 00:21:02.000
A surf shorts plus casual. Okay. Same thing. We have some of them. Yeah, you know, a shirt,

194
00:21:02.88 --> 00:21:06.40
you know, a few shirts or whatever. Make sure you have a lot of your machine over there.

195
00:21:06.40 --> 00:21:11.28
Two brush. Two brush. Two paste. If you can kind of get toothpaste there and really a

196
00:21:11.28 --> 00:21:15.44
tooth brush. Yeah. And that's a big part too, where, you know, kind of like leaving off the land.

197
00:21:15.44 --> 00:21:19.76
And the sounds dumb. I know, but it's the same thing. It's the same thing. So you're really

198
00:21:19.76 --> 00:21:25.20
good at like LA. You just count going on a long, it's an off the land. It is the travel version

199
00:21:25.20 --> 00:21:28.96
of leaving off the land. When you go to a civilized place, what I'm saying is the stretch. Yeah,

200
00:21:28.96 --> 00:21:32.56
you don't when you go to like LA or something. And you're like, should I be there for two days?

201
00:21:32.56 --> 00:21:38.80
Um, you know, two, two and a half hour drive or whatever. It's like like a better bring enough to face or a better

202
00:21:38.80 --> 00:21:42.96
right, you can stop it any store in LA and get it. Just leave off the land. Don't look at that stuff.

203
00:21:42.96 --> 00:21:47.20
Let me can live off the land. It's the same thing. That being actually a good reality television.

204
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:54.96
Echo living off the land. Good. It's for installing rolling into a Ralph's in LA. I can make this work.

205
00:21:57.92 --> 00:22:01.52
It's the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. The travel version.

206
00:22:01.52 --> 00:22:07.84
Exactly. Never mind. Honten building a bow, hunting down and killing an animal and scanning it. Never

207
00:22:07.84 --> 00:22:12.08
mind that. No, no, let's two advanced. We're rolling into vans.

208
00:22:14.96 --> 00:22:20.80
Check. All right. So we're saying flexible. Yeah. We are prepared to live off the land if needed.

209
00:22:20.80 --> 00:22:24.96
If there's a washer right there. Well, you're going to bring that much clothes. You seem

210
00:22:24.96 --> 00:22:31.44
to be the same. My first deployment. I went to Guam. Yeah. And I thought I was going to know them.

211
00:22:31.44 --> 00:22:37.84
Right. So I wasn't. I didn't plan for like a bunch of civilian stuff to be happening. I didn't plan to be

212
00:22:38.56 --> 00:22:46.32
you know down at the beach all day. Most days, which is what we actually did on my first deployment.

213
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:53.36
And I think I had maybe two pairs of shorts and I just wore them the entire time. I would wear

214
00:22:53.36 --> 00:22:58.72
one for like a week because you're just in the ocean. You're, you know, you're taking a fresh water shower.

215
00:22:59.44 --> 00:23:04.88
And you're just totally good to go. Yeah. Even off the land as they say. Yeah, man. That's a,

216
00:23:04.88 --> 00:23:10.32
and that's how quiet. Like you're wearing your shorts. So you're going to the beach in

217
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:14.88
pretty much the whole time. Pretty much. Yeah. So yeah, you bring two of those. You're pretty good.

218
00:23:14.88 --> 00:23:21.20
Pretty shallow back up. You got back up. Yeah. That's true. Check. See, I knew there was light

219
00:23:21.20 --> 00:23:26.88
infantry application, even the echoed trails exist. It's where they're. Yeah. We're there. All right.

220
00:23:26.88 --> 00:23:32.24
Back to the book. Not surprisingly self-aliance improvisation and flexibility,

221
00:23:32.24 --> 00:23:39.44
pre-set unique tactical style as the key features of which are surprised, stealth, shock,

222
00:23:39.44 --> 00:23:44.72
and offensiveness. The light infantry always seek to retain the initiative to keep the

223
00:23:44.72 --> 00:23:50.80
enemy off balance. That was, uh, here's a good quote from Dean Listch, because I was training with

224
00:23:50.80 --> 00:23:56.40
him the other day and what he was teaching class. He said, okay. So the guy on the bottom,

225
00:23:57.28 --> 00:24:01.36
across side, what advantage is does he have? Were you here for this cross?

226
00:24:03.44 --> 00:24:09.12
No, but given what you're saying right now, he said that. Yeah. So he, you know, and everyone kind of

227
00:24:09.12 --> 00:24:13.60
throws, actually there's not a lot of guesses, because let's face it. When you're on the bottom

228
00:24:13.60 --> 00:24:19.44
when someone's across side on you, you're not feeling a bunch of advantages. So he looked at it

229
00:24:19.44 --> 00:24:24.24
with a positive attitude. And he said, no one, you're on the bottom and some of the cross sign

230
00:24:24.24 --> 00:24:30.72
on you, you can't fall down. Yeah. That's a good attitude. Yes. That's a good attitude. I thought of

231
00:24:30.72 --> 00:24:36.96
another one and say it to him. I'll have to discuss it with him. It's the, the person is going to

232
00:24:36.96 --> 00:24:42.40
have to give space to submit you in most cases from a cross side. There's going to be an

233
00:24:42.40 --> 00:24:46.96
opportunity when if people try and submit you. If you'll just hold you, you're, you're going to

234
00:24:46.96 --> 00:24:53.60
get held. Yeah. But if they make movement to advance position or to submit you, they're,

235
00:24:53.60 --> 00:25:01.12
the advantage that you have is there's going to be some space. Yeah. Like, I think there's even less space

236
00:25:02.32 --> 00:25:09.20
if, if, if I'm in Dean Lister's closed guard, I feel like I can move less even when he's going

237
00:25:09.20 --> 00:25:13.52
for something than if he's across side. That's kind of how I feel might be particular to my

238
00:25:13.52 --> 00:25:20.96
style or whatever, but can't fall down when you're already on the ground. That's a big advantage. I guess.

239
00:25:23.92 --> 00:25:30.24
Off balance. The way that a good GJ2 player would attack your balance, that is just,

240
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:35.20
that that's the same thing we have to think about on the battlefield. How can we keep the

241
00:25:35.20 --> 00:25:40.32
enemy off balance in the business world? If the, if the competitors know exactly what we're

242
00:25:40.32 --> 00:25:44.88
going to do, they just plan for it. They make a plan. And the more they think they know what you're

243
00:25:44.88 --> 00:25:49.36
going to do, the less flexible their plan is. So we need to do something that throws them off balance.

244
00:25:50.16 --> 00:25:56.24
Going to be good for you. Light infantry operates most frequently at night and uses terrain

245
00:25:56.88 --> 00:26:03.28
at hand to full advantage. Light infantry is terrain oriented and is able to switch operations

246
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:16.000
from one type of terrain to another without paralysis of the mind. Parallysis of the mind.

247
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.64
How often you see that? It's very, it's actually a specific thing. A switch in terrain,

248
00:26:22.64 --> 00:26:28.80
a switch in environment, and people walk up. I see it. Yeah, I can see that.

249
00:26:28.80 --> 00:26:33.44
Especially, and this goes back to something the army said, especially when it's a surprise.

250
00:26:34.16 --> 00:26:40.48
If I surprise you with something, that's when brain freeze happens. If you're going to see a

251
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:46.96
common, you're preparing for it. So it's almost like surprise has to be utilized to cause people to freeze

252
00:26:46.96 --> 00:26:55.92
up. Yeah, in my opinion. Moreover, in combat, the light infantry is logistics conscious, but not

253
00:26:55.92 --> 00:27:03.12
logistics dependent. Light infantry relies on superior tactics, not superior firepower to win the battle.

254
00:27:03.12 --> 00:27:10.56
That's your answer. The short discussion. This short discussion barely scratches the surface of

255
00:27:10.56 --> 00:27:16.48
the issue. It does, however, capture the essence of classic light infantry, the Proverbs, which are

256
00:27:16.48 --> 00:27:22.56
listed here, going to more detail. And hopefully clarify the picture somewhat further. They have been

257
00:27:22.56 --> 00:27:28.56
gleamed from the close study of several excellent light infantry forces in the recent past.

258
00:27:28.56 --> 00:27:34.48
Although many of these Proverbs apply equally well to regular infantry, as a group, they do a fair

259
00:27:34.48 --> 00:27:41.36
job of embodying the nature of classic light infantry as distinct from regular infantry in conclusion.

260
00:27:41.36 --> 00:27:47.52
Even though many of these Proverbs should be embraced by all infantry, not just light infantry,

261
00:27:47.52 --> 00:27:55.12
history is demonstrated the difficulty of including the difficulty of inculcating the light

262
00:27:55.12 --> 00:28:01.84
infantry virtue or style, except in small segments, usually elite elements of national armies.

263
00:28:01.84 --> 00:28:10.96
So what do you say in there is? These are great. And they'll work for regular infantry.

264
00:28:10.96 --> 00:28:22.24
But these are a little bit harder to grow inside of an organization. So chances are, even though

265
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:26.56
they're good, idea to try. Chants are, you're not going to be as effective making this happen.

266
00:28:26.56 --> 00:28:32.80
Now, I can tell you that I think this thing was written decently, I don't know, 40 years ago,

267
00:28:32.80 --> 00:28:39.44
something like that. I think times have changed. I think you'd find going out and me actually

268
00:28:39.44 --> 00:28:46.80
working with light infantry units. Man, they're good. So, sorry, with regular infantry units as well.

269
00:28:46.80 --> 00:28:51.44
And armored infantry units as well. I've worked with all of them and they're all freaking good to go.

270
00:28:51.44 --> 00:28:56.08
That's what you get good when you've been at war as a nation for a couple decades.

271
00:28:59.36 --> 00:29:03.68
The US Army, particularly has a history of being tied to its logistics chain and has relied

272
00:29:03.68 --> 00:29:09.44
more on firepower than on military art for its victories. So I'm truth to that. Let us assume that the

273
00:29:09.44 --> 00:29:14.64
new light infantry divisions should be trained in the classic light infantry style. The army may find

274
00:29:14.64 --> 00:29:20.64
it difficult to do so. Since it is a style with which we are basically unfamiliar except for our

275
00:29:20.64 --> 00:29:26.40
specialty forces, particularly the Ranger Battalions. The first step, however, is for the army to

276
00:29:26.40 --> 00:29:31.84
decide what it means by light infantry. Is it merely light infantry made light by the absence of

277
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:37.04
heavy equipment or is it something more like what has been described here? This is a question

278
00:29:37.04 --> 00:29:42.80
which would be answered quickly for it has significant bearing on the training, strategy, and leadership

279
00:29:42.80 --> 00:29:48.64
of our new light divisions. So that's kind of his intro. I think it's a good solid intro.

280
00:29:48.64 --> 00:29:52.80
I think it gives us an idea. And it also, again, the reason I think this is so

281
00:29:52.80 --> 00:30:03.60
and so usable is because we're talking about a smaller, weaker force going up against a bigger,

282
00:30:03.60 --> 00:30:09.84
stronger force. This is maneuver warfare. This is indirect attacks. That's what this is. That's

283
00:30:09.84 --> 00:30:15.60
why it applies. Yeah, I feel like this applies to more people, especially when you're in a

284
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:20.96
sort of playing it to other than something other than military stuff, where because it's so

285
00:30:20.96 --> 00:30:25.52
feels like in any way that's so often we find ourselves in a situation where it's like,

286
00:30:25.52 --> 00:30:30.56
I don't have the experience, I don't have the resources, I don't have the, you know,

287
00:30:30.56 --> 00:30:35.84
I'm not as big as that guy or whatever, and we feel like we kind of don't have a chance,

288
00:30:35.84 --> 00:30:41.52
you know, because they're just so far ahead of us in that way. So it's like, oh, no one has a chance,

289
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:46.64
you know, they're like, I'm an apoli and whatever way, you know. But it's not the case, you know?

290
00:30:46.64 --> 00:30:51.84
It's true. And you know, it's interesting from a business perspective. So I work with all different

291
00:30:51.84 --> 00:30:59.36
industries, right? But one day I'll be talking to a client who is the small startup, you know,

292
00:30:59.36 --> 00:31:05.36
400 employees on the growth pattern, they're making things happen, but they still can't.

293
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:10.56
They still have some disadvantages against the big boys, right? And so I'll be talking to them about,

294
00:31:10.56 --> 00:31:14.000
okay, here's what we need to do. You need to work as, you know, you work on your mobility,

295
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.12
how can we mend out maneuver the enemy like all those things? The next day or even the next hour,

296
00:31:19.12 --> 00:31:25.84
I'll be talking to one of the big companies that has all these little elements out there,

297
00:31:25.84 --> 00:31:29.52
these small startups that are trying to snatch business share, what are we going to do to

298
00:31:29.52 --> 00:31:37.12
immobilize those small. So I actually end up teaching both insurgency and counter insurgency,

299
00:31:37.12 --> 00:31:47.44
depending on the client. And what's good is that I, since I, since I, I'm familiar with how each

300
00:31:47.44 --> 00:31:56.40
one of those components needs to win. So I can help them counter what's going on. So it boils

301
00:31:56.40 --> 00:32:03.92
down to execution too. The boils down to execution, can you actually do what I'm talking about?

302
00:32:03.92 --> 00:32:08.96
Yeah, because if you can't come up with a flexible plan or you can come up with a flexible plan,

303
00:32:08.96 --> 00:32:14.80
but you don't have the leadership to actually make it happen, you're, did you're not going to make it happen?

304
00:32:14.80 --> 00:32:19.20
Yeah, that's so true. So even like, they like, he talked about the mindset early on,

305
00:32:19.60 --> 00:32:24.24
the mindset that we're looking to change direction. We're looking to be creative, like, it's

306
00:32:24.24 --> 00:32:29.68
quick, you know, quick, unlike, you know, let's face it, the bigger a, I don't know, I'm thinking

307
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:34.000
of a company, by the way. But if like the bigger the company is the more it seems like, hey,

308
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.32
you better have your protocols in place that we all follow. Otherwise, the thinking, you know,

309
00:32:38.32 --> 00:32:43.36
an organized, so it's like, they had kind of no choice, but to be a little bit more rigid in that way.

310
00:32:43.36 --> 00:32:52.40
Rigid bureaucratic, very stable, very difficult to change. So what does that mean? That means

311
00:32:52.40 --> 00:32:55.52
when you're a small company, you're like, oh, you client needs this. Guess what? We can do that

312
00:32:55.52 --> 00:33:00.16
for you. Contraderant Uncle's shift how we do things for you. Yeah. The big companies, we don't

313
00:33:00.16 --> 00:33:04.40
actually do that. Yeah, let me put you on hold. You can, you can, you can, you will, you will give

314
00:33:04.40 --> 00:33:08.32
you the system that we use and you can use the system we use. The small clients like, well,

315
00:33:08.32 --> 00:33:13.28
adapt our system. No factor. Let's do it. Shoot it. Don't get them on customer service. But

316
00:33:13.28 --> 00:33:17.68
you go to a big company customer service. They're going to be outsourcing the reading scripts,

317
00:33:17.68 --> 00:33:21.68
like all this stuff, because they kind of got in a, in a big way where it's like, hey,

318
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:26.80
we need everyone to give the same quote unquote quality customer service. Like, we need, you know,

319
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:30.96
you got to know all this stuff about our big, longstanding company. You know, to help these people.

320
00:33:30.96 --> 00:33:38.40
So you better be educated. Right. So good example. Big company, maybe they, they know that they're

321
00:33:38.40 --> 00:33:44.08
going to lose out on customer service, because the small company can can adapt quicker and make

322
00:33:44.08 --> 00:33:48.24
adjustments. That means the big company needs to invest more in that area. And maybe they need

323
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:55.36
to hire some experts, and maybe they need to dump some money into, you know, computer,

324
00:33:56.16 --> 00:33:59.36
help where I can actually log into your computer and I can help if we're talking about it's

325
00:33:59.36 --> 00:34:02.96
software. Right. I can, well, you know, no problem. Mr. Charles, let's say what, if you type in this

326
00:34:02.96 --> 00:34:06.40
code word, I'll get into your computer right now and I can get that fixed for you, right? You want to

327
00:34:06.40 --> 00:34:12.000
put money. So you know where your weaknesses are. You identify your weaknesses and then you

328
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.80
fix them. And if you're the small guy, you know where the enemies weaknesses are. The big

329
00:34:18.80 --> 00:34:26.24
guys weaknesses are and you exploit those. You start making fun of them. Start capitalizing on them.

330
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:29.76
Which you got to be careful, because if I start if you're the big guy and I start making fun of

331
00:34:29.76 --> 00:34:32.56
your customer service, you could, you're, you're, you're, you're, you'll dump a bunch of money in

332
00:34:32.56 --> 00:34:36.96
customer service also and you start beat me there. So I got to be careful. I don't want to provoke

333
00:34:36.96 --> 00:34:43.44
the big guy. Yeah. Maybe I just want to stay under the radar and and keep taking customers from you

334
00:34:43.44 --> 00:34:49.12
and you don't really know why. It's because I respond to every single customer service issue,

335
00:34:49.12 --> 00:34:54.88
you know, with a team that's going to talk directly within three minutes. That's a very, uh,

336
00:34:56.88 --> 00:35:03.36
that's very significant concept staying under the radio radar. I think it's underrated to

337
00:35:03.36 --> 00:35:08.88
because the even just as a human being it feels like you want the attention, you want the credit,

338
00:35:08.88 --> 00:35:15.20
you want the recognition for this, you want to win the award, you want them and know you won or,

339
00:35:15.20 --> 00:35:22.48
you know, even more scary or counterproductive is you want the enemy to know that you just did this.

340
00:35:22.48 --> 00:35:26.72
Yeah. And that's more counterproductive because now you're giving away what your position is.

341
00:35:26.72 --> 00:35:31.92
Yeah. You're giving away what you're doing to achieve victory and part of that goes deep because

342
00:35:31.92 --> 00:35:37.68
even even if you're not like, because no, you know, like, okay, if you want the enemy to know,

343
00:35:37.68 --> 00:35:41.44
right, that's like some like, hey, this may get into you. I got something against you personally.

344
00:35:41.44 --> 00:35:45.84
So boom, yeah, I got you what kind of a thing, right? It's like a challenge almost kind of thing,

345
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:49.76
but even if like just everyday stuff, you know, some people, for example, they'll make

346
00:35:49.76 --> 00:35:53.60
they'll start making a lot of money or something and then they'll buy jewelry or something like that.

347
00:35:53.60 --> 00:36:00.16
Or something flashy, you know, or, you know, they maybe they have some online following or something

348
00:36:00.16 --> 00:36:04.48
and then they want to show their nice cars and their nice cows and they want to do all this stuff, right?

349
00:36:04.48 --> 00:36:08.88
Just to like show how it's like a need, I guess, you know, for recognition or whatever.

350
00:36:08.88 --> 00:36:14.000
But now what you'll what you did is you provoke the giant now. You made everyone know about their

351
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
stuff. Now this giant, whatever that may be, I don't know how that translates, but it is something

352
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.36
where the people trying to take advantage of that, people asking you for stuff, you know, people

353
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:27.36
trying to use your XYZ that you just showed them that you have, by the way.

354
00:36:27.36 --> 00:36:32.88
Volunteerly, because you needed somewhere, now they're going to try to find a way to use that

355
00:36:32.88 --> 00:36:35.36
for their advantage and then it's like everybody too.

356
00:36:35.36 --> 00:36:38.000
Essentially, that's the giant. There's your giant right there.

357
00:36:38.80 --> 00:36:42.80
You're going to watch out for that. You've got to watch out for your ego getting you to do things

358
00:36:42.80 --> 00:36:47.60
that are stupid. Yeah. Straight up. Probing the giant or whatever.

359
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:56.24
Like even in Iraq, in Ramadi, we didn't want, we tried to, we didn't want the enemy to know what was

360
00:36:56.24 --> 00:37:02.48
happening. Like why are people getting shot? What's happening? You know, we don't like, oh yeah,

361
00:37:02.48 --> 00:37:09.84
we're snipers, we got teams in, no, just all of a sudden they start losing guys. A lot of them.

362
00:37:10.80 --> 00:37:14.40
They don't know why. It's now it's fear. And then obviously they figured out pretty quick.

363
00:37:17.20 --> 00:37:23.12
Check. All right. So now we get into the, to the, to the proverves themselves, the

364
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:28.16
proverves of the light of victory. Here we go. Lighting for lighting for the operations. There

365
00:37:28.16 --> 00:37:32.16
exists a light infantry attitude, which can be described in a few characteristic words,

366
00:37:32.16 --> 00:37:37.20
offensiveness, initiative, surprise, improvisation and total self-reliance.

367
00:37:40.72 --> 00:37:44.24
There's a part where we could just end the podcast right now, right? Because if you take those

368
00:37:44.24 --> 00:37:49.44
were those concepts to the end degree, you, you know what we're talking about.

369
00:37:49.44 --> 00:37:57.92
But you won't get the full impact. Light forces are undaunted by terrain. terrain is viewed

370
00:37:57.92 --> 00:38:04.64
as an ally. A combat multiplier for the light infantrymen, light forces are terrain oriented.

371
00:38:04.64 --> 00:38:10.56
Very little terrain is impossible to true light infantrymen. Now what I, this to me,

372
00:38:10.56 --> 00:38:18.72
one thing that I was taught as a young frogman, bathroom, talking to. When there's bad weather

373
00:38:18.72 --> 00:38:25.68
or there's bad terrain, that means that the enemy has to contend with it and they're not going to.

374
00:38:25.68 --> 00:38:32.96
And we are. And so terrain, oh, there's horrible steep crazy hills. Cool. Yeah, that means the

375
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:39.28
enemy is not going to be on patrol up there. We will be undaunted. Light infantry does its best when

376
00:38:39.28 --> 00:38:48.32
it lives on in and off the land. It must be comfortable in the bush or in rouse. If you're

377
00:38:48.32 --> 00:38:57.84
going to put your arms in that life for two days. How much of that? Okay, so let's take

378
00:38:57.84 --> 00:39:05.04
you, Jitsu. How much of it is Jitsu good because let's face it. If you play out like zombie

379
00:39:05.04 --> 00:39:11.84
apocalypse in your head, you kind of think, hey, when it comes down to it, if I can beat people

380
00:39:11.84 --> 00:39:17.12
and fights. Look, because we ran out of bullets, you know what I'm saying? Like you get to a point

381
00:39:17.12 --> 00:39:24.80
where I'm going to come down to me against you. Yeah. So there's a little bit of that being able

382
00:39:24.80 --> 00:39:33.04
to survive that you get from Jitsu. Yeah, actually that's a real rock, kind of form of it, you know,

383
00:39:33.04 --> 00:39:38.88
where I think we actually talked about this. I think it was just me we were just talking.

384
00:39:39.68 --> 00:39:45.92
Where you can have like a big group of people and then they can then you and the group can be heavily

385
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:51.28
armed and then and then have a bunch of knives and then have body armor or whatever, whatever,

386
00:39:51.28 --> 00:39:57.68
right? Just all the tools and all the whatever. There's like you can lose your weapons. You can

387
00:39:57.68 --> 00:40:03.28
lose your knives. You can lose your body armor or you forget it or I don't know whatever. But

388
00:40:03.28 --> 00:40:09.36
at some point it's very possible that it's going to be just like you said, it's me against you.

389
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.52
No knives, no weapons, no whatever. Yeah, could be that way in about an hour and a half. Okay,

390
00:40:15.52 --> 00:40:21.12
I understand. And then it's like then where are you? Is it night and day? You know,

391
00:40:21.12 --> 00:40:26.80
are you just businesses, usual kind of kind of thing? Like, you know, I'm sorry. It could

392
00:40:26.80 --> 00:40:30.88
make me go back to video games. But you know how like you go? Is it game called Zanik? Actually,

393
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:35.04
I feel like I'm brought this up before where if you get like this weapon, is this the super

394
00:40:35.04 --> 00:40:39.28
spreader? No, yeah, that one too. Yeah, on contra when you get the spreader, you're like

395
00:40:39.28 --> 00:40:42.96
bone-bomb and you can win. Oh, it's called the spreader. I call it the super spreader because this

396
00:40:42.96 --> 00:40:50.24
is grown up. Yeah. But once you die and lose that weapon and you go back to just what your

397
00:40:50.24 --> 00:40:56.24
issued in the video game, which is what we call the P shooter, you got to be good with that thing.

398
00:40:56.24 --> 00:41:01.44
And if you're not, you're just going to game over. That's a be comfortable in the bush.

399
00:41:01.44 --> 00:41:07.68
Yeah. It's true. Good intelligence is vital to light infantry, intelligence obtained by the

400
00:41:07.68 --> 00:41:14.08
light infantry from every source from the national level to the use of local inhabitants,

401
00:41:14.08 --> 00:41:18.24
reconnaissance and petroleum. Yeah, gathering information. Absolutely. Conventional tactics are

402
00:41:18.24 --> 00:41:24.48
no good for light forces. You know, I we'd have to dig down and see what you're actually talking

403
00:41:24.48 --> 00:41:28.88
about when you're talking about conventional tactics. I'm not going to, I'm not going to bless

404
00:41:28.88 --> 00:41:36.80
that one on the spot. I get it. Right. You can't plan sometimes, for instance, conventional

405
00:41:36.80 --> 00:41:41.52
forces will plan for a certain number of casualties for a certain operation. Like you're just

406
00:41:41.52 --> 00:41:45.76
going to take these casualties. You get into light infantry smaller units. That can be a real

407
00:41:45.76 --> 00:41:54.000
problem. You can't just accept casualties. For example, historically light infantry operations

408
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.64
are mounted at battalion level and lower light infantry operations are highly dependent on squad

409
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:07.04
platoon and company level actions. Got it. Light forces need high quality communications to coordinate

410
00:42:07.04 --> 00:42:14.32
decentralized efforts into a coherent whole. Okay. So this article is written 40, 50 years ago.

411
00:42:14.32 --> 00:42:23.84
Something like that. And it's just interesting to me. Communications of all kinds are unreliable.

412
00:42:23.84 --> 00:42:32.72
Radios, they're all unreliable in a combat zone. And if you don't have coordination measures

413
00:42:32.72 --> 00:42:38.40
in effect that don't rely on radio communications, you can count on there to be problems.

414
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:45.12
And I'll tell you, even as our, as our, as our communication capabilities get better,

415
00:42:46.56 --> 00:42:52.56
when you start talking about fighting against near peer adversaries, meaning big giant

416
00:42:52.56 --> 00:43:00.48
countries like ours that have big giant technological equipment like we have. You can't,

417
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:04.72
you get to a point where you can't use radios because they have something called defin capability.

418
00:43:04.72 --> 00:43:11.36
If you've heard of that direction finding capability. So if you key up your radio, they know

419
00:43:11.36 --> 00:43:18.88
your yard. Your radio gives off radio waves. And there are ways that radio, those radio waves

420
00:43:18.88 --> 00:43:26.48
can be detected and they can pinpoint your location. So you have to be able to operate with

421
00:43:26.48 --> 00:43:34.80
minimal, minimal communications. So I don't like this, this particular one says light forces need

422
00:43:35.76 --> 00:43:40.000
high quality communications to coordinate decentralized efforts into a coherent whole. Actually,

423
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.32
I don't, I don't like that. When I tell you this is what we're doing, this is why we're doing it.

424
00:43:44.32 --> 00:43:49.04
I give you the commanders intent. I want you to be able to go and I don't need to talk to you again.

425
00:43:49.04 --> 00:43:54.000
And by the way, you'll see whatever other unit needed to do something coordinate with you,

426
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.60
you're going to know what's happening. By what's happening? You're going to see an explosion.

427
00:43:57.60 --> 00:44:00.56
You're like, oh, life's still tuned. Just started their breads. That means I can go. Like,

428
00:44:00.56 --> 00:44:05.60
you're, you're seeing them saying, you need to be able to coordinate things. You can't be reliant

429
00:44:05.60 --> 00:44:13.92
on radios. You can't. There was probably a year, there's probably a five, five-year time period,

430
00:44:14.80 --> 00:44:20.48
where you where the radios were good and the enemy direction-finding capability wasn't quite

431
00:44:20.48 --> 00:44:30.80
there yet. But that period's over. Do to a general shortage of combat support light forces must

432
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:34.48
do an excellent job of combining arms when they have a chance. Yes, absolutely. You got to be

433
00:44:34.48 --> 00:44:38.64
able to work with the other units that can support you. You got to be able to do a light infantry

434
00:44:38.64 --> 00:44:43.84
forces must be masters of improvisation, familiar with all kinds of weapons, vehicles, landing craft,

435
00:44:43.84 --> 00:44:50.16
and so forth. Yes, light infantry forces make use of whatever is at hand to improve their combat

436
00:44:50.16 --> 00:45:00.32
capability. Absolutely. Native, irregular forces are often used in support of light infantry.

437
00:45:00.32 --> 00:45:04.80
Yes, what does that mean? That means you have to go build relationships with the local populist. That's

438
00:45:04.80 --> 00:45:10.88
what that means. In order to do that, you got to know that that's what you need to do. Because

439
00:45:11.52 --> 00:45:17.92
18-year-old kids with machine guns are focused on building relationships. They're not. They go

440
00:45:17.92 --> 00:45:22.64
into a country. They have a machine gun. They have grenades and if what they think they're

441
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:30.16
going to do is hawk grenades and shoot machine guns. So you need to educate them and make sure that they

442
00:45:30.16 --> 00:45:36.08
understand how the local populist is going to play a role in giving you support.

443
00:45:41.60 --> 00:45:46.56
Light infantry must remain flexible in mind and action capable of reacting quickly.

444
00:45:47.92 --> 00:45:56.96
Already talked about flexible, plants, flexible, mind. When a light infantryman rises from his

445
00:45:56.96 --> 00:46:04.88
sleep, he's ready to fight. I like that. Light infantryman rely on camouflage. Why is that?

446
00:46:04.88 --> 00:46:10.88
Because we don't want to give away our position. We don't want to advertise what we're doing.

447
00:46:10.88 --> 00:46:17.60
We don't want to advertise how we're beating the competition. We want to have camouflage.

448
00:46:18.56 --> 00:46:25.36
Against heavy enemy forces, the light infantry always requires a great deal of augmentation. Cool.

449
00:46:25.36 --> 00:46:33.44
You've got to face the reality that you may not have the resources that are needed to defeat

450
00:46:34.72 --> 00:46:40.48
bigger stronger enemy. You have to be able to say that. So if you're, that's why there's a lot of

451
00:46:40.48 --> 00:46:46.64
industries right now where you can get help inside your small business. You can get IT support.

452
00:46:47.44 --> 00:46:52.88
You can get personnel support. You can get engineering support. You need all this kind of support.

453
00:46:52.88 --> 00:46:57.52
And you've got to recognize when you need to utilize some of that other support.

454
00:46:58.24 --> 00:47:01.60
You might not necessarily want to build it out. Had this conversation,

455
00:47:01.60 --> 00:47:05.36
life was just telling me this, when we were starting EF online.

456
00:47:06.64 --> 00:47:10.48
And we started talking about building this and building that. And I said, hey,

457
00:47:12.24 --> 00:47:16.40
we don't want to become a software company. And he was like, check.

458
00:47:17.20 --> 00:47:22.16
Because it's better to hire someone that does that. That's what they do. I don't want to

459
00:47:22.16 --> 00:47:28.56
have a bunch of software engineers and programmers and IT. So I don't want to, I don't want to have all that.

460
00:47:29.36 --> 00:47:34.000
That's a different business. We don't want to be an eye, we don't want to be a software company.

461
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.56
We want to be a leadership training company. Cool. And he was, he was like, got it.

462
00:47:38.56 --> 00:47:42.80
Because we had started because it's one of those mission creep things, right? We were like,

463
00:47:42.80 --> 00:47:47.36
you're like, if we just add this, we'd spilled that and all of a sudden, you got a proprietary

464
00:47:47.36 --> 00:47:52.48
system that you got to maintain and hire more people. We're not looking to do that. We why?

465
00:47:52.48 --> 00:47:58.48
We think light infantry. And what you need to do is use augmentation if needed.

466
00:48:01.52 --> 00:48:07.52
Light infantry men must be able to climb crawl, swim, ski, snow shoe,

467
00:48:07.52 --> 00:48:14.32
repel, stock, run and hide. Obviously, echo this is written before snowboarding. Yes,

468
00:48:14.32 --> 00:48:18.48
because I know you're over there thinking, those of you that don't know, echo's now a snowboarder.

469
00:48:21.44 --> 00:48:26.08
Isn't it interesting to actually talk about the fact that you got to have all these different

470
00:48:26.08 --> 00:48:33.92
ways of getting around by using your own energy? Light infantry must be able, marksman,

471
00:48:33.92 --> 00:48:38.48
proficient in the use and maintenance of many weapons, light forces rely on pioneer skills at

472
00:48:38.48 --> 00:48:46.48
all level, beginning with the squad to properly exploit terrain, pioneer skills. Does that mean you

473
00:48:46.48 --> 00:48:53.36
have a Ralph's card? Nobody knows where everything is. I don't say. As you get lost these foreign

474
00:48:53.36 --> 00:49:00.000
stores, you know, can be hostile. Do you remember driving around? Yeah, you do. Remember no GPS is just so

475
00:49:01.36 --> 00:49:05.76
to give it. It's given now. Yeah, to give it. How did you get around before GPS to your

476
00:49:05.76 --> 00:49:10.000
member off-top yet? Like you're in a new spot or you're going to a new spot kind of far away.

477
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:16.24
You brought a map? No, you get a map. Yeah. Well, I guess if I was going somewhere where there wasn't

478
00:49:16.24 --> 00:49:20.32
going to be a way to live off the land and go to this convenience store and buy a map. Sure,

479
00:49:20.32 --> 00:49:29.12
but I was taking my daughter to Coronado, like a little while ago. And so Coronado is where I

480
00:49:29.12 --> 00:49:38.64
worked for 20 whatever years. And what I live now a few miles from Coronado. And we get in the car

481
00:49:39.28 --> 00:49:43.20
and I start pulling out my daughter's like doing and putting the GPS. Yeah.

482
00:49:43.20 --> 00:49:49.20
I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious right now? And she says, yeah, why?

483
00:49:49.20 --> 00:49:54.80
I don't go. It's Coronado. I worked there for 20 freaking years. Yeah. And she's like, well, I didn't,

484
00:49:54.80 --> 00:50:01.28
I don't know. Yeah. But that's, but that's her mentality is when you get in a car, you're going somewhere.

485
00:50:01.28 --> 00:50:06.000
You GPS? Uh, yeah. Because she's just a young man. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy.

486
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.16
Uh, well, because I had the exact same incident. Wasn't Coronado was downtown. And I

487
00:50:10.16 --> 00:50:14.24
worked downtown for a number of years and go down there, whatever. So I don't downtown.

488
00:50:14.72 --> 00:50:19.36
Brian, oh, downtown, like back on my hand. Yeah. And we're going in the same thing.

489
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:24.56
She puts it in Sarah. Sir. Yeah, puts it in the or is like, she puts it in her GPS and her phone

490
00:50:24.56 --> 00:50:31.84
and starts rattling off the directions as if I don't know, you know, this man, man of the world doesn't

491
00:50:31.84 --> 00:50:38.80
know, um, you know, how to get to the place we're going to downtown my hood, whatever. Um, so yeah,

492
00:50:38.80 --> 00:50:43.84
I don't need that GPS, but the thing is, Sarah's not as young as you're not. Obviously, but it

493
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:49.28
does start to become like a habit, you know, I mean, just so happened, I knew my way around. I think

494
00:50:49.28 --> 00:50:53.84
if I didn't know my way around, see, I same thing automatic itself. Like I don't even think twice

495
00:50:53.84 --> 00:51:00.000
about it. Like in back in the day, I used to go, um, you know, to places or whatever. And I remember going

496
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.44
in the either the white pages of the yellow pages or whatever they'd have the map in the front of it.

497
00:51:05.44 --> 00:51:12.000
And then I'd write down directions. That's it. I lost before two, a couple times, but it's not

498
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.20
not quite as effective as the. Yeah. I wonder what's how much that skill is just being lost now.

499
00:51:17.20 --> 00:51:22.96
I'm sure it feels like it's gone straight up gone. You can find one or two guys and we could be

500
00:51:22.96 --> 00:51:28.48
real negative about that. Oh, we could also be well, what skills have people now garnered because

501
00:51:28.48 --> 00:51:34.24
they don't have to worry about that skill anymore. Yeah. Not sure. The next one, the pertinent

502
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:41.20
range or standards of land navigation are a must for light forces. Got nowhere you're going. Got

503
00:51:41.20 --> 00:51:47.68
nowhere you are. Yeah. Light infantry rarely uses roads or trails. What does that mean? How's that

504
00:51:47.68 --> 00:51:53.20
apply? I'll tell you to apply. You find new ways of doing things. And just because there's a beaten

505
00:51:53.20 --> 00:51:58.56
path doesn't mean you should necessarily take it. Doesn't mean you can't take it. But you should

506
00:51:58.56 --> 00:52:04.40
think, is there a better way to get this done? Light infantry forces, left in combat theaters for

507
00:52:04.40 --> 00:52:09.92
long, inevitably become heavier due to the acquisition of heavier weapons plus increased logistics

508
00:52:09.92 --> 00:52:15.92
structure. What does that mean? Keep moving. Keep moving. The minute you settle down,

509
00:52:15.92 --> 00:52:21.44
now you're going to start to grow in ways that aren't necessarily beneficial.

510
00:52:23.44 --> 00:52:28.000
Light infantry appreciates heavy fire support when it is available, but it's not dependent on it.

511
00:52:29.28 --> 00:52:36.88
Physical conditioning and mental strength are absolute musts across the board.

512
00:52:38.96 --> 00:52:43.04
Light forces, this goes into the next section, which is called the offense.

513
00:52:43.04 --> 00:52:48.96
Light forces may be deployed at the operational level of war, but they always fight at the

514
00:52:48.96 --> 00:52:55.12
tactical level. Light forces think at the tactical level. And okay there's another one I'm like,

515
00:52:56.72 --> 00:53:02.40
I got a press pause on that one. I'm not blessing fully. Okay, except for

516
00:53:02.40 --> 00:53:07.04
Cavia, I guess Cavia. Light forces think at the tactical level, but you better

517
00:53:07.04 --> 00:53:13.12
understand the strategic goal. You have to understand why you're doing what you're doing.

518
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:19.20
Otherwise, you can't think at the tactical level. Because if I say, all right, Echo, we want to

519
00:53:19.20 --> 00:53:23.84
take out that building. And you say, cool, we got it. And you get in there and there's a little

520
00:53:23.84 --> 00:53:29.60
bit of resistance. So you, you know, blow it up. And then I say, actually strategically, we're trying

521
00:53:29.60 --> 00:53:32.88
to keep the infrastructure in place here. And you're like, oh, I might have wanted that. Let me know that.

522
00:53:32.88 --> 00:53:40.16
So thinking tactical is cool, it better be nested inside the strategic goals.

523
00:53:41.92 --> 00:53:48.08
Does your team? Where's your team at, by the way? And your business, in your company,

524
00:53:48.08 --> 00:53:53.76
in your family, where's their head at? Do they understand the tactical goals that you're going

525
00:53:53.76 --> 00:53:58.88
for? Do they understand, are those tactical goals nested inside what we're trying to do strategically?

526
00:53:58.88 --> 00:54:07.68
Good question. Two light infantry loves the night. Light forces fight at night and hide during the

527
00:54:07.68 --> 00:54:16.16
day. What, what, how does it? How does that apply? I'll tell you how you need to understand where

528
00:54:16.16 --> 00:54:22.16
you're at at an advantage. That's what that's saying. Look, night, day, whatever. We're not,

529
00:54:22.16 --> 00:54:27.44
we're not transferring this. You know, you're not going to be, hey, our, you know, our construction

530
00:54:27.44 --> 00:54:31.52
company is going to do better at night. That's not what we're saying. What you say is, hey,

531
00:54:31.52 --> 00:54:38.16
there's an area of construction that we're good at. We're really good at high end custom homes

532
00:54:38.16 --> 00:54:43.76
or we're really good at multiple massive track homes that we just repeat the same. You're going

533
00:54:43.76 --> 00:54:49.20
to be fine. What you're good at? And you're going to exploit that. You're going to start focusing

534
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:54.96
on that area. You're going to hide from the areas we're going to get beat. Light infantry attacks

535
00:54:54.96 --> 00:55:04.08
violently and suddenly on two or more axes, seeking, flanks and rear of the enemy. Right, we're

536
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:10.16
not going toe to toe. We're not, this is an apugelistic endeavor where we stand here and punch each

537
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:18.48
other. We maneuver. We get the flanks. This is, you can see you how all this stuff just fits right

538
00:55:18.48 --> 00:55:26.000
into my brain. This is fits right into my brain. Attacks are conducted fiercely and tenaciously

539
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.84
against enemy weaknesses, not strength, not the enemy strengths. That's maneuver warfare.

540
00:55:31.84 --> 00:55:40.80
maneuver warfare. We maneuver to wear the enemy as week. That's jujitsu. We put my deadlift power,

541
00:55:41.36 --> 00:55:48.24
which is my hips and my back against echoes curling power, which is an arm lock. And despite

542
00:55:48.24 --> 00:55:57.84
your relatively powerful curling capabilities, done compared to my deadlift and the arm lock will win.

543
00:56:02.08 --> 00:56:10.24
Light forces attack stripped for action. So when you're in the field, you can be end up

544
00:56:10.24 --> 00:56:15.36
carrying a lot of equipment. When you go on the attack, they're saying here, don't carry that

545
00:56:15.36 --> 00:56:22.000
equipment with you into the attack. What this is, what this is is prioritize and execute. Look,

546
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.72
we carried all this weight in. Now we need to focus on the biggest problem we've got, which is

547
00:56:26.72 --> 00:56:32.48
doing this assault. Take off your gear, leave your water behind, not all that leave a bulk of your

548
00:56:32.48 --> 00:56:36.72
water behind. Leave your cold weather gear. Leave that stuff behind. We're going on an assault.

549
00:56:36.72 --> 00:56:42.000
We're going to be light. It's going to take us an hour and we're going to win. That doesn't mean you

550
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.16
leave everything. Light infantry creates a shock effect by the suddenness and fierceness of their attacks.

551
00:56:50.16 --> 00:57:04.000
Check. Attacks are closely synchronized, which is fine. Again, you have to coordinate things.

552
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.72
So that perfect synchronicity is not a requirement for success because perfect synchronicity is

553
00:57:13.12 --> 00:57:20.64
likely not going to happen. If you don't put some fudge in your schedule for the manufacturing

554
00:57:20.64 --> 00:57:27.52
of your new item, the chances that every piece of that item that your manufacturing comes out

555
00:57:27.52 --> 00:57:33.44
exactly as desired and then fits perfectly with the rest of the pieces that you've

556
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:38.64
manufactured. The chances of that happening are very small. So if you put everything

557
00:57:38.64 --> 00:57:45.20
reliant on perfect synchronization, you're dumb. We don't want to do that.

558
00:57:47.28 --> 00:57:55.12
Can are there situations where you do need to do that? Sure. You're launching a freaking

559
00:57:55.12 --> 00:58:01.28
rocket in the space. You know what I mean? So you've got NASA. You've got all these people

560
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:10.96
focused on one thing that literally cannot have any issues. So there's all these checks and balances

561
00:58:10.96 --> 00:58:16.80
the whole way through and you have actually get a very, very, very high probability of success.

562
00:58:17.36 --> 00:58:22.88
However, it's still not perfect. And if you tried to keep going until everything was perfect,

563
00:58:22.88 --> 00:58:26.96
you wouldn't ever launch a rocket because you can't get everything completely square in a way.

564
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:33.60
So if you're not at risk of losing a $500 billion or whatever trillion dollar rocket

565
00:58:34.56 --> 00:58:43.44
and you what you're trying to do is get a get something to market. You need to not rely on

566
00:58:43.44 --> 00:58:48.000
perfect synchronization. Things won't be perfectly synchronized. You need to be okay with that.

567
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.32
If you have a propensity to be super-animal-retensive about every little thing,

568
00:58:52.32 --> 00:58:55.20
it's going to be hard for you to be in a leadership position without letting some of that go.

569
00:58:55.20 --> 00:59:00.08
You have to be like, no, you know, it's pretty close. There's some people that cannot say that.

570
00:59:01.84 --> 00:59:05.60
There's some people that cannot say, that's pretty close. That'll work.

571
00:59:06.24 --> 00:59:10.40
Yeah, isn't that one of the main initial challenges of becoming like, uh, what do you call us?

572
00:59:10.40 --> 00:59:15.04
We've got to start delegating when you have a growth situation or whatever. Like, that's the main one.

573
00:59:15.04 --> 00:59:19.60
I would say I'm absolutely right. Or it's one of the main ones. Yeah. Or you can't like,

574
00:59:19.60 --> 00:59:24.64
can't let it go. I would buy this perfectly. Cool. But you have 14 other things you need to

575
00:59:24.64 --> 00:59:34.64
focus on. Yeah. Get a grip. Light infantry always. And that is italicized in the text.

576
00:59:35.44 --> 00:59:40.64
When you're on an English major, they call things the text. Like,

577
00:59:42.48 --> 00:59:47.52
are you referring to the text? Yeah. What's the difference between the text and the copy?

578
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:53.36
Uh, copies what they say in, uh, in, um, I think that's more of like a marketing word.

579
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:57.20
Marketing though. Like, hey, did you can you check the copy on this latest thing?

580
00:59:58.08 --> 01:00:03.12
So those parts. So it's like the purpose of what has been written. That kind of dictates

581
01:00:03.12 --> 01:00:07.92
whether you call it the text or the text. Yeah. But the English, you know, professors. Yeah.

582
01:00:07.92 --> 01:00:11.52
I think it's an elevated way of speaking. Because they don't want to say,

583
01:00:11.52 --> 01:00:15.20
what would you think of this book? Right? That's what my human would say.

584
01:00:15.20 --> 01:00:20.96
They say, well, I'm a person with that. They say, don't you give me some food back on on this text?

585
01:00:20.96 --> 01:00:28.48
They're like, well, man. Right? They're getting paid money. That's what they can't just call it a book.

586
01:00:28.48 --> 01:00:31.12
I know. That's why we're reporting the other way. Did you read the play?

587
01:00:31.92 --> 01:00:38.56
What do you think of that play? No, it's how to, was the impact of that text on you? Come on.

588
01:00:39.60 --> 01:00:43.52
Yeah. It's not even necessary. Sometimes. Then again, I'm sure there's a real

589
01:00:43.52 --> 01:00:49.28
reason, you know. No, you're right. You're right. There is a reason. And if we,

590
01:00:49.28 --> 01:00:54.40
where I'm sure we're going to get some English professor that's going to drop the hammer of

591
01:00:54.40 --> 01:01:00.000
grammar on us. Yeah. You don't say, well, text actually refers to blah, blah. Yeah. That's one of

592
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
those things where it could be where you know how like there was a reason back in the day where

593
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.92
the reason was like significant. And you could get it. You could jam it up if you didn't like this

594
01:01:07.92 --> 01:01:12.80
day or distinguish whatever. And then, but so much has happened since then. And then, you know, the

595
01:01:12.80 --> 01:01:16.96
classic, you know, guys or whatever they're like holding on to it saying like, no, it is

596
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:20.64
important and all the stuff is like, no, it's not because I know exactly you're talking about

597
01:01:20.64 --> 01:01:25.92
still. But you know what I love about this particular case? Guess what a text now means. I

598
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:35.28
said you are four one text. That's my kids text each other. Yeah. And they, they got funny text.

599
01:01:35.28 --> 01:01:44.40
Maya. So you know how, I don't know my son when he texts, there's you know how, well, I have an

600
01:01:44.40 --> 01:01:49.12
iPhone and it has an auto correct, right? So it automatically capitalizes letters, automatically

601
01:01:49.12 --> 01:01:54.48
puts periods. And that's how that's this. That's the default setting. I'm pretty sure of the phone, right?

602
01:01:54.48 --> 01:02:02.80
Thanks. He must have manually goes in there and removes those. So everything he writes is just no

603
01:02:02.80 --> 01:02:11.84
no corrections, no capitalization and no punctuation of any kind. It's just words. It's just

604
01:02:11.84 --> 01:02:20.72
uncapitalized words. And then my kids were telling me, if you put a period, if you, if you text

605
01:02:20.72 --> 01:02:28.40
me echo when you're like, hey, can you make it to dinner tonight? And I write no period, the period's

606
01:02:28.40 --> 01:02:34.32
kind of like aggressive. Yeah. Right. I don't forget if you told me that. Oh, man. Yeah, that's crazy.

607
01:02:34.32 --> 01:02:41.04
How how this whole like, we'll say for like, my culture texting culture and takes on this whole,

608
01:02:41.04 --> 01:02:46.24
like these rules and etiquette and all this and that's crazy. It's like if if something's in all

609
01:02:46.24 --> 01:02:50.80
cat, well, I guess if it was in all caps, it'd be more of an exclamation, right? Even I think all

610
01:02:50.80 --> 01:02:57.04
caps is like all caps is straight up almost like fighting words, right? If I'm all capping you,

611
01:02:57.04 --> 01:03:02.72
oh yeah. It's where it's going. But that's like carry over from even before text messaging went.

612
01:03:02.72 --> 01:03:06.80
The all caps is like an exclamation. That was your jam in the beginning, all caps?

613
01:03:07.68 --> 01:03:12.64
What, what did I all get? When you started texting? Oh, like when I started texting you? Yeah. Well,

614
01:03:12.64 --> 01:03:16.24
you didn't text everyone like that. It was just me. You didn't really know. You saw all these

615
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:24.000
texts in all caps. Like you just thought that that was just more dope. Well, that's funny. You know,

616
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.12
it's funny. I write in all caps. You know, it was like that writes in all caps. So I guess for me,

617
01:03:29.12 --> 01:03:33.36
it would just look normal. Yep. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. You know, like some people

618
01:03:33.36 --> 01:03:38.72
though, right? And I used to do this. I went through fees all caps. But the capitals were just a little bit bigger

619
01:03:38.72 --> 01:03:44.64
with bigger figures. Yeah. I will do that depending on the scenario. And I'll give you an example.

620
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:50.96
When I write the path, that tea is a little bit bigger than the peas a little bit bigger.

621
01:03:50.96 --> 01:03:57.04
Gotcha. Because we're acknowledging the capitalization. Actually, now I think about it. You and I are very,

622
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:06.08
very aware of capitalization of letters in text. Yeah. Well, yeah. They tell a story.

623
01:04:06.08 --> 01:04:13.36
They tell stories. They need something. Yeah. And then there's a difference between font and

624
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:18.96
typeface. I'm unfamiliar. I don't know what it is. So you brought up something you have no,

625
01:04:18.96 --> 01:04:23.60
no, no, we're talking about text. Like, okay. So text back in the days, like the text,

626
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:27.04
and now it morphed probably a couple of times into different things. And then now,

627
01:04:27.84 --> 01:04:32.000
so tell me there's a difference between font and typeface. Yeah. That's another example of like

628
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.52
these things that might have had a difference at some point. But I don't know what it is. Like font.

629
01:04:37.52 --> 01:04:42.000
Like what is font? You don't know what font is. I think I do. Okay. Font is just the

630
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.04
letters that are used to, it's the design of the letters. Yeah. Actually, it was kind of a letter.

631
01:04:49.04 --> 01:04:54.56
Yeah. And then typeface. That's what apparently typeface is. The design of the letters. I don't

632
01:04:54.56 --> 01:04:59.52
know if there's any difference between these two. Yeah, man. So typeface is the elevated expression.

633
01:04:59.52 --> 01:05:07.68
I think. I think so. Check. All right. Back to this italicized word. Light infantry always

634
01:05:07.68 --> 01:05:16.24
relies on surprise achieved through stealth, deception, silence, and maneuver on foot. I just

635
01:05:16.24 --> 01:05:21.36
will question mark next to like always. Always. We want to be careful about saying always.

636
01:05:23.28 --> 01:05:31.92
But I wanted to reflect the text here itself. Light infantry always seek to retain the initiative.

637
01:05:31.92 --> 01:05:39.28
Now that one, the always, which in this case isn't italicized, I agree with. Do you ever want

638
01:05:39.28 --> 01:05:44.80
to give up the initiative? No, you don't. You always want to maintain the initiative. I'm

639
01:05:45.76 --> 01:05:48.96
scrambling my brain trying to think of a situation where you know what? I don't think I want the

640
01:05:48.96 --> 01:05:56.40
initiative right now. I can't think of one. I can't think of one. Light forces practice

641
01:05:56.40 --> 01:06:01.44
rigorous fire discipline, but when necessary, they deliver intense fires on short duration to

642
01:06:01.44 --> 01:06:07.84
over and well the enemy. Check. Light infantry turns the enemy's weapons against him.

643
01:06:09.44 --> 01:06:16.000
Awesome. Which is, and what's awesome about that is when you've got, what you've got a competitor

644
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:24.24
that is utilizing something. They're utilizing something. They're utilizing a, some piece of marketing.

645
01:06:24.24 --> 01:06:29.36
They're utilizing some attack on your clients. They're utilizing something. You can't just say,

646
01:06:29.36 --> 01:06:33.60
oh no, that piece of marketing really hurts us. No, you need to look at that. How can we turn

647
01:06:33.60 --> 01:06:41.84
that piece of marketing against them? Light infantry forces conduct relentless pursuit of

648
01:06:41.84 --> 01:06:50.96
enemy light forces and irregular forces to destroy them in detail. Relentless pursuit of enemy

649
01:06:50.96 --> 01:06:58.64
light forces. Light infantry offensive operations are characterized by a high degree of decentralization.

650
01:06:58.64 --> 01:07:04.72
Yes, which is contrary to saying, I better have radio to coordinate every single movement with you.

651
01:07:04.72 --> 01:07:11.12
That's centralized. Light infantry patrols relentlessly and aggressively ambushes the enemy.

652
01:07:11.12 --> 01:07:17.04
Light infantry sometimes double times into battle. Think about that. You're like, hey, we're running.

653
01:07:18.40 --> 01:07:26.64
We're running. That's an interesting thing. I'm concerned. I'm a little bit concerned.

654
01:07:26.64 --> 01:07:30.16
If I have to run to get to the battle, I'm a little bit concerned about what I'm doing.

655
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:37.04
Because I'm running, I feel like I'm late. If I have to run to battle, I feel like I'm late.

656
01:07:39.20 --> 01:07:46.16
It seems like that's like a flex move as well. Conquer. Yeah. It's sort of like, will run.

657
01:07:47.28 --> 01:07:51.60
I'm not sure if that's a smartest thing. I'm running. That means I'm late and now I'm tired when I show up.

658
01:07:51.60 --> 01:07:54.88
Yeah, a little bit more. I mean, I'm not saying you can't function. I'm saying you're a little

659
01:07:54.88 --> 01:07:58.64
more tired than you would have been. Do we get a cool flex, right? Do we get to say,

660
01:07:58.64 --> 01:08:06.32
we'll run? Yeah. We'll run. It could have been, it could be, I guess, under certain circumstances,

661
01:08:06.32 --> 01:08:10.24
be like a psychological warfare situation. Because in football, that's what was, where it's like

662
01:08:10.24 --> 01:08:14.000
hustle off the field, hustle on the field, right? When you think about, okay, there might be a

663
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.36
time saving element to that for sure. But, Brad, if I'm really not hustling on and off the field,

664
01:08:19.36 --> 01:08:24.72
I got more energy for the play. I'll tell you what, when you run, when, like, you see,

665
01:08:24.72 --> 01:08:31.68
kids wrestling and one kid runs, like they go out of bounds, one kid runs back, runs back,

666
01:08:31.68 --> 01:08:37.44
meet, you know, toll on the line, ready. And the other kids, 100, go with psychological warfare.

667
01:08:37.44 --> 01:08:43.76
Yeah, psychological warfare. Maybe that's why they're, maybe I think, right, I think it might be

668
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:50.000
in the parlance of our time. A little flex. Light infantry tracks, listens,

669
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.12
locates, cuts off raids, and ambushes the enemy. Isn't that weird to think about? When you're,

670
01:08:57.12 --> 01:09:01.52
when you're competing against someone, you actually should think you should be tracking,

671
01:09:01.52 --> 01:09:08.000
listening, locating, cut off, raiding and ambushing them. Think about, the thing that I like about

672
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.72
that is your focus on them. The thing I don't like about it is your focus on them. Right? There's

673
01:09:12.72 --> 01:09:18.08
a little dichotomy there. We can't be focused so much on what the other guy's doing. We need to be

674
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:28.24
doing something. The enemy never knows where the light infantry is or when he will attack.

675
01:09:28.24 --> 01:09:34.32
Check. Don't give away your position for the 50 millionth time. I'm not going to,

676
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:41.04
when Eko has a different viewpoint than me, I don't start off by telling him my viewpoint and

677
01:09:41.04 --> 01:09:45.28
explaining why my viewpoint is better. I don't, I actually ask more questions about your viewpoint

678
01:09:45.28 --> 01:09:49.76
and trying to understand your viewpoint and get your viewpoint till I actually know exactly where it is

679
01:09:50.56 --> 01:09:52.24
before I review my position.

680
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.04
Standing operating procedures are used widely by light forces for quick silent action. Yes,

681
01:10:03.04 --> 01:10:08.88
standard operating procedures. For silent action, I mean, you don't have to talk. We know what's

682
01:10:08.88 --> 01:10:16.48
going to happen. Next one, rehearsals, training, pre-combat briefings and sharing of information

683
01:10:16.48 --> 01:10:23.92
to the lowest levels are more common among light forces. This is the cornerstone of decentralized command.

684
01:10:24.96 --> 01:10:30.08
rehearsal is training, pre-combat briefings, all that stuff. The infiltration of large units

685
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:35.28
of light infantry is possible in close terrain and is necessary for success in major operations.

686
01:10:35.28 --> 01:10:40.40
Under these conditions, light forces infiltrate to attack the rear, to establish blocking positions,

687
01:10:40.40 --> 01:10:43.28
and to create obstacles in the path of a retreating enemy.

688
01:10:46.64 --> 01:10:54.72
Yeah, check. What that means is we're moving into good positions.

689
01:10:55.84 --> 01:11:00.24
And we're doing it in a clandestine manner so the enemy doesn't know that what we're doing.

690
01:11:00.24 --> 01:11:07.12
And the last one for offense is hand-to-hand combat is a required skill for the light infantry.

691
01:11:07.92 --> 01:11:14.56
Affirmative. Man, the propagation of hand-to-hand combat right now

692
01:11:15.92 --> 01:11:24.40
in the last sense of UFC started is insane. Yeah. It's insane. Yeah. Yep, it is. I mean, even in

693
01:11:24.40 --> 01:11:31.52
that community, it's insane. Not to mention like when you explore the spectrum of the guy who

694
01:11:31.52 --> 01:11:38.56
doesn't know anything versus the guy, he's the guy who knows a lot. Even within the people of

695
01:11:39.12 --> 01:11:48.72
who knows it's so much variety. It's so vast, you know. It is insane evolution.

696
01:11:48.72 --> 01:11:56.48
And since 1993, it's crazy. The evolution since 1993. Since the ultimate fighting championship,

697
01:11:57.20 --> 01:12:03.04
the evolution of combat sports is almost incomprehensible. Yeah. Because before then,

698
01:12:03.04 --> 01:12:08.64
it's kind of like people didn't really have a valid stable, we'll say, a reliable foundation

699
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:13.76
of fighting. And then kind of you just to kind of essentially provide it that. And everyone's

700
01:12:13.76 --> 01:12:18.64
are learning it. So what does it look like? This is kind of the answer. The answer to this question is

701
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:22.24
what you're talking about. Like what does it look like when everyone knows the foundation? I

702
01:12:22.24 --> 01:12:27.36
imagine we can build on it. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess there's other thing. I mean, if you look at

703
01:12:27.36 --> 01:12:37.28
basketball, right? I mean, basketball now is different than it was in 1954. It's a different game.

704
01:12:37.28 --> 01:12:43.60
I mean, we're talking. It's a different game. But I think that's less obviously, I think mixed

705
01:12:43.60 --> 01:12:49.36
martial arts is might be the most, but skateboarding. You seen what a kid will do on skateboard

706
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:58.000
right now? Yeah. It's my debugging. Surfing. I mean, surfing is nuts. Yeah. It's nuts.

707
01:12:58.56 --> 01:13:04.32
What guys are doing from a technical level, from a technical blasting heirs. Like what?

708
01:13:04.32 --> 01:13:10.96
But not only that blasting 360, all the aires where they're not even, they're not touching

709
01:13:10.96 --> 01:13:16.64
their board, but they're going up and doing a 360 in the air and landing it. If you brought an

710
01:13:16.64 --> 01:13:23.68
old school surfer from 1962, yeah. And if you were to bring a, if you were to bring a 1962

711
01:13:23.68 --> 01:13:30.96
surfer and say, hey, if you go back to 1962 instead, do you think that a surfer will be able to launch

712
01:13:30.96 --> 01:13:37.36
off the wave into the air? Turn 360 degrees without touching his board and land. Does that sound

713
01:13:37.36 --> 01:13:43.84
possible? Do you know what I mean? Does that sound? Does that actually sound possible?

714
01:13:44.56 --> 01:13:50.40
It doesn't, it's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to comprehend that that could be an actual thing.

715
01:13:50.40 --> 01:13:54.24
Yeah. You know, they probably would be, what do you mean not touch the board? Meaning not grab that

716
01:13:54.24 --> 01:13:57.84
board. They didn't even understand grabbing the board. Like you wouldn't probably had to say that

717
01:13:57.84 --> 01:14:02.40
part. Like how are you going to get a board out of the water? First of all, their board weighs

718
01:14:02.40 --> 01:14:11.04
42 pounds made a red wood. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So there's these, like you said, there's a

719
01:14:11.04 --> 01:14:16.000
foundation. Once this foundation gets created, you get to build on it. And what's, that's what's

720
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.04
so crazy. I've been talking about this on the debrief a little bit. I've been talking about

721
01:14:19.04 --> 01:14:25.36
an EF online leadership. There's a base there, but people just ignore it. People think,

722
01:14:25.36 --> 01:14:30.72
well, they, they don't understand that leadership is a skill. Just like just like surfing,

723
01:14:30.72 --> 01:14:36.48
just like skateboarding, just like playing basketball. It's a skill. And if you learn,

724
01:14:37.68 --> 01:14:42.32
then you, if you pick up a book and you read, you'll learn about it and you go, oh, I can use these

725
01:14:42.32 --> 01:14:48.64
moves and people don't do that. People don't understand why it's very difficult for people

726
01:14:48.64 --> 01:14:52.24
to understand that leadership is a skill. Even though they go, that guy's a great leader.

727
01:14:52.24 --> 01:14:58.48
They think that that person was just blowing that way. They don't think what they're actually doing.

728
01:14:59.60 --> 01:15:05.36
I mean, when I was running the training, and I got to watch, that's what made it. So

729
01:15:05.36 --> 01:15:10.32
I'm like, oh, that guy's not doing what that other guy did. And that's why they're falling apart

730
01:15:10.32 --> 01:15:22.16
right now. Got it. Check. Next section is called The Defense. Light forces can

731
01:15:22.16 --> 01:15:27.60
defend, but they are more suited to the offense. Defense can immobilize the light infantry

732
01:15:27.60 --> 01:15:34.24
consumed to much ammunition and develop rigidity of mind. These are the dangers of the defense

733
01:15:34.24 --> 01:15:40.80
for light infantry. So, you know, we're, we're not feeling like we're, we're going to focus on that.

734
01:15:42.08 --> 01:15:47.04
Light forces must be able to disappear into the ground rapidly for defense. Light infantry

735
01:15:47.04 --> 01:15:56.000
men must be good diggers and fast. Light infantry men must be masters of fortifications.

736
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.36
It seems like we're focusing a lot to be going on master of fortification if that's not something

737
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:04.32
we really want to be doing. Light forces defend on the reverse slope. I like that one because

738
01:16:04.32 --> 01:16:11.44
that's using the terrain to defend. Spoiling attacks are a frequent tactic of light forces.

739
01:16:11.44 --> 01:16:20.16
Normally light forces are ill-armed to defend against armored vehicles even in close terrain.

740
01:16:20.16 --> 01:16:25.12
This is a very important one. Why? Because it is acknowledging one of our weaknesses.

741
01:16:26.72 --> 01:16:32.64
It's acknowledging one of our weaknesses. So, here we are. We have this tough mentality. What is it?

742
01:16:32.64 --> 01:16:38.80
The never say die mentality. We adapt. We overcome and we have that mindset. And we're in a

743
01:16:38.80 --> 01:16:41.84
light infantry platoon. We're out there and all of a sudden we see armored vehicles coming.

744
01:16:42.64 --> 01:16:48.16
And we go, you know what? Adapt to overcome. We can we can do this. And what this is saying is actually no.

745
01:16:49.76 --> 01:16:54.88
There's actually no. We are ill-armed. So now we see armored vehicles coming. We say,

746
01:16:54.88 --> 01:16:58.40
you know what, hey, we need a bag out of here. We need to get in a serious defense position.

747
01:16:58.40 --> 01:17:04.96
Or we need a hide so we don't get seen. So, as a leader, you need to recognize what your

748
01:17:04.96 --> 01:17:08.64
weaknesses are. And then you need to actually explain those to the team. Hey, this is not a fight we

749
01:17:08.64 --> 01:17:16.80
want to get into. Hey, this other, this other manufacturer wants to go toe to toe to us on making this

750
01:17:16.80 --> 01:17:27.28
highly regulated item. We are not good at making highly regulated items. We don't want to get in that fight.

751
01:17:27.28 --> 01:17:30.48
Now, everybody knows that. Hey, you want to spend a bunch of money on a bunch of equipment that

752
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:34.32
costs a lot. And then you get scrutinized over the production that you're making. That's not what the

753
01:17:34.32 --> 01:17:38.40
game would. And you go ahead and have that game. So you need to understand what your weaknesses

754
01:17:38.40 --> 01:17:47.12
are and then you need to propagate those to the team. Light infantry counter attacks immediately to

755
01:17:47.12 --> 01:17:52.40
retake lost key terrain or to hit the enemy's rear or flank while he is attacking. This is what I

756
01:17:52.40 --> 01:17:59.68
like about this is this is a mindset. This is a standard operating procedure. When we get attacked

757
01:17:59.68 --> 01:18:04.24
if we start to lose to if we lose terrain, just everybody know that we're coming back. We're going to

758
01:18:04.24 --> 01:18:13.20
immediately retake. That's what we're doing. The light infantryman is invisible and silent in the

759
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:24.80
defense by day or by night. Good way to do defense. Not be seen. Logistical support,

760
01:18:24.80 --> 01:18:30.16
true light infantry is not tied to a supply line light infantryman. Distain logistics. That's so strong.

761
01:18:30.16 --> 01:18:35.52
That's so strong. As an important planning factor, they can always quote, make do.

762
01:18:38.80 --> 01:18:44.16
Distain's a strong word. Distain's a strong word. Yeah, in a way, doesn't that kind of

763
01:18:45.20 --> 01:18:50.88
makes it seem like you're painting yourself in a corner. You know, we're anti this almost. Yeah.

764
01:18:50.88 --> 01:18:56.40
Yeah. And I get it. I get it because it's because logistics becomes mission creep. Meaning,

765
01:18:56.40 --> 01:19:02.80
hey, look, we just, you know what, we're going to need water. And we're going to need water.

766
01:19:02.80 --> 01:19:06.24
Buffalo's, you know, one of Buffalo's big tanks of water. What any water Buffalo's?

767
01:19:07.36 --> 01:19:10.96
And that means we're going to need vehicles to tell the water buffalo's. And that means we're

768
01:19:10.96 --> 01:19:15.04
need fuel for those vehicles. And that means we're going to need to maintenance crew for those vehicles.

769
01:19:15.68 --> 01:19:18.48
And that means we're going to need to feed the maintenance crew. You see where this is going.

770
01:19:18.48 --> 01:19:23.92
Yeah. Right. So that's why I think we need to be careful when we open the door to large logistics,

771
01:19:23.92 --> 01:19:29.36
because once we open the door, the freaking party gets crashed. And now all of a sudden, we got, you know,

772
01:19:29.36 --> 01:19:34.56
the cops get called. Yeah. So we've got to be careful on that in that regard.

773
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:42.72
Light forces can operate separated from their lines of communications by depending on enemy and

774
01:19:42.72 --> 01:19:48.64
indigenous supplies. Cool. Light infantrymen can live off the land like echo Charles can.

775
01:19:51.12 --> 01:19:55.60
I can't wait. I can't wait to see the governments on this one. But we could do some really

776
01:19:55.60 --> 01:20:04.40
funny stuff with you, you know, lost an LA. What's he going to do? Okay, motel eight.

777
01:20:04.40 --> 01:20:10.56
It looks like a police. I think I found. I think I found a location from the layout for the night.

778
01:20:10.56 --> 01:20:13.20
What the? Yeah.

779
01:20:16.16 --> 01:20:21.36
Light forces make maximum use of the indigenous population for bearers, handbladers,

780
01:20:21.36 --> 01:20:26.40
soldiers, loaders, and so forth. Look, this goes back to us earlier, forming relationship with the

781
01:20:26.40 --> 01:20:34.32
local populace. You need to make sure you emphasize that with the team. Otherwise, what do you have?

782
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:41.20
You have young men with machine guns and grenades. And that's what they joined the military to do

783
01:20:41.20 --> 01:20:46.56
in most cases. So some people came in with more idealistic visions than that, which is great.

784
01:20:46.56 --> 01:20:53.04
God bless. But a lot of 18-year-old young men that joined the military

785
01:20:53.84 --> 01:20:59.12
didn't join for those idealistic reasons. So if we don't get them on board with the

786
01:20:59.12 --> 01:21:04.88
treating the indigenous population with respect and explaining how that indigenous population

787
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:08.64
can help us succeed in our mission and explain that we are actually there to support the

788
01:21:08.64 --> 01:21:12.24
indigenous population. If we don't do those things as leaders, we're going to end up screwing things up.

789
01:21:15.36 --> 01:21:20.48
Light infantry frequently resupplies at night. The use of helicopters and phobias craft

790
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:24.56
and like craft is vital to the resupplies of light infantry.

791
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:29.20
The main thing is that the military improvisation is a constant feature of light infantry logistics.

792
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:39.60
I'll say this about improvisation. You can train for improvisation.

793
01:21:40.88 --> 01:21:47.60
And the way you train people to improvise is by making them improvise. That's what you do.

794
01:21:47.60 --> 01:21:54.64
You can't, and what makes it hard is training by its nature is a structured thing. I'm

795
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:57.44
going to set up some training for you. Echo trials. Here's what we're going to do.

796
01:21:57.84 --> 01:22:01.60
You're going to start in the mount. You're going to go for a walk. You're going to start here.

797
01:22:01.60 --> 01:22:05.04
So there's a structure to it. And we can go through that structure and I told you what move you're

798
01:22:05.04 --> 01:22:10.16
going to do and you're going to drill that move. So what I need to do is put you in situations

799
01:22:10.16 --> 01:22:17.44
where there is no move. Hey, get on your back, put your left leg over your right elbow,

800
01:22:17.44 --> 01:22:22.32
and your partner is going to go and grab your other ankle. Ready, go. You have to improvise.

801
01:22:22.32 --> 01:22:28.40
Get out of there. You can actually start to learn to improvise better. So we need to do that when we train

802
01:22:28.40 --> 01:22:31.76
subordinate leadership when we train our teams. We need to put them in situations that they

803
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:37.76
actually have to improvise because there's methodologies and thought processes that fall into

804
01:22:37.76 --> 01:22:44.64
better improvisation improvisation. If you never think about it and you throw your team into such

805
01:22:44.64 --> 01:22:49.20
situation and guess what? You throw your team into any real situation. They're going to have to improvise.

806
01:22:49.20 --> 01:22:53.92
That plan is not going to be perfect. And if you don't train them to improvise, they're not going to be

807
01:22:53.92 --> 01:23:04.40
able to do it. Technology. Next section, weapons used by light forces must not impose a logistical

808
01:23:04.40 --> 01:23:13.52
burden. Cool. If equipment cannot be man packed or muel slash donkey pack, the light infantry

809
01:23:13.52 --> 01:23:19.60
generally has little use for it. Cool. We're trying to stay light. Light. The helicopter is

810
01:23:19.60 --> 01:23:25.12
almost revolutionary and it's effects on light force, mobility and logistical support. Check.

811
01:23:27.12 --> 01:23:32.48
The delivery of the light infantrymen into the area of operations has changed over time,

812
01:23:32.48 --> 01:23:38.24
but actions on the ground have changed little check. Historically,

813
01:23:38.24 --> 01:23:45.60
advantages in technology have not been the deciding factor in light infantry operations. This

814
01:23:45.60 --> 01:23:51.28
is important. So we can't just rely on the fancy new equipment that we've got obviously,

815
01:23:52.32 --> 01:23:57.04
that's not going to make the difference. It's not going to make the critical difference. It

816
01:23:57.04 --> 01:24:02.32
might have a difference. It might make an impact. But historically, technology is not going to

817
01:24:02.32 --> 01:24:10.96
be the deciding factor. Next section is called political arena. Political action is often

818
01:24:10.96 --> 01:24:14.80
needed to support the light infantry operations. Cool. You know what that means? Play the game.

819
01:24:15.92 --> 01:24:24.08
Grab play the game. Light infantry profits from a psychological operations edge

820
01:24:24.08 --> 01:24:31.84
and must be prepared to use this advantage. All kinds of psychological things,

821
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:36.72
all these, the shock that we're talking about, the surprise that we're talking about.

822
01:24:37.52 --> 01:24:45.04
Those things are a psychological advantage. And we need to be able to exploit those psychological

823
01:24:45.04 --> 01:24:53.12
advantages. Utilize them. Cooperation between a light infantry security force and the local

824
01:24:53.12 --> 01:25:00.56
police and intelligent structure is essential to success. What does that mean? Build relationships.

825
01:25:04.16 --> 01:25:11.76
The hearts and minds roll in low intensity conflict is one to which the light infantry

826
01:25:11.76 --> 01:25:19.84
normally is very sensitive. I would say that the light infantry should be very sensitive to it.

827
01:25:19.84 --> 01:25:27.12
But I also think if we as leaders don't explain to the team the importance of the quote

828
01:25:27.12 --> 01:25:34.88
hearts and minds, then we will not have them as sensitive as they should be. I don't think there's a

829
01:25:36.08 --> 01:25:44.40
predisposed mindset that leans towards people that join the military thinking hearts and minds.

830
01:25:45.60 --> 01:25:48.64
Thank you. Have to account for the fact that there's a decent chance they're not thinking

831
01:25:48.64 --> 01:26:01.60
about the hearts and minds. The last section is leadership. Light infantry leaders are generally

832
01:26:01.60 --> 01:26:10.000
of higher quality than conventional infantry leaders. I don't agree with that. I give that one

833
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:17.92
on the down vote. I worked with conventional infantry leaders and they're freaking awesome. I've

834
01:26:17.92 --> 01:26:22.40
worked with light infantry leaders and they're also awesome. I don't think they're generally

835
01:26:22.40 --> 01:26:31.76
of a higher quality. Light infantry leader traits are imagination. Isn't that funny the first

836
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:39.92
one imagination? The next one flexibility? The next one hardiness? The next one

837
01:26:39.92 --> 01:26:50.16
endurance, confidence, improvisation, discipline, technical expertise, perseverance, and so forth.

838
01:26:50.16 --> 01:26:56.96
Can we or do say so forth? Because you listed one two three four five six seven eight nine

839
01:26:56.96 --> 01:27:06.48
ten. It's like more. Yeah, but imagination and flexibility. That is not what people think of when

840
01:27:06.48 --> 01:27:10.80
they think of military leaders. They don't think of imagination and flexibility. They actually

841
01:27:10.80 --> 01:27:16.72
think of the opposite. Regided. Yeah, can you say that too right? Where? Or actually it might

842
01:27:16.72 --> 01:27:20.88
have been another book where creativity was one of the attributes of the leader or whatever.

843
01:27:21.68 --> 01:27:26.000
And you wouldn't really think that you wouldn't think creativity. It's more like, I don't know,

844
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.80
maybe the first thing that comes to mind maybe for a normal person would be, I don't know, authority

845
01:27:30.80 --> 01:27:35.20
years. You know, something a little bit more free. Yeah. Right. And I talk about discipline all the

846
01:27:35.20 --> 01:27:39.28
time, but this one's only good if it's complemented by imagination and flexibility.

847
01:27:42.08 --> 01:27:46.88
Light leaders lead from the front. Consequently, they suffer a higher ratio of casualties than

848
01:27:46.88 --> 01:27:56.08
normal. I don't think this is something that we're super trying to make a proverb. Right?

849
01:27:56.88 --> 01:28:05.12
I get lead from the front. Absolutely. But are we are we actually leading from the front to a point

850
01:28:05.12 --> 01:28:12.48
where we're a higher level of casualty as a leader? I'm not going to, I'm going to say, if I'm

851
01:28:12.48 --> 01:28:17.44
talking to my leaders, I'm going to say, listen, you lead from the front and you also position yourself

852
01:28:17.44 --> 01:28:22.24
to where you can continue to lead without becoming casualty. Leadership is the most important thing

853
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:29.68
on the battlefield. For losing leaders, we are losing the most important thing on the battlefield.

854
01:28:29.68 --> 01:28:37.92
I get it. I get the attitude, but we have to make sure we're smart about it.

855
01:28:40.96 --> 01:28:46.48
Junior officers and noncommissioned officers must possess skills above and beyond those of regular

856
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:51.84
infantry. The skills include demolitions, artillery calls for fire, the use of closer support

857
01:28:51.84 --> 01:29:02.56
and familiarity with foreign weapons and foreign languages. Fair enough. Fair enough. That comes

858
01:29:02.56 --> 01:29:08.88
down to all those things, all those things are just training. So when you're in light infantry units,

859
01:29:08.88 --> 01:29:14.56
you should have the opportunity for more training. You can get some of these skills. Teamworked

860
01:29:14.56 --> 01:29:26.08
and confidence in each other are vital to light infantry operations. Teamwork and confidence in each

861
01:29:26.08 --> 01:29:38.24
other. That is a huge piece of teamwork. I call this trust as opposed to confidence in each other.

862
01:29:38.24 --> 01:29:44.24
That's what bonds a team together. I trust you. You trust me. You trust that I'll be there

863
01:29:44.24 --> 01:29:49.84
if you need me. I trust that you'll be there if I need you. And if I can trust that you're

864
01:29:49.84 --> 01:29:53.76
going to be there if I need you, I'm more apt to go out and make something happen because I know

865
01:29:53.76 --> 01:30:01.84
you got my back. Here's a good one. Courage without teamwork is of little value.

866
01:30:03.60 --> 01:30:08.24
Makes sense. They didn't say it's of no value, but if I don't have some teamwork back in

867
01:30:08.24 --> 01:30:14.64
me up when I do something courageous, not what we're looking for. We need teamwork.

868
01:30:15.44 --> 01:30:22.56
Moral, a spree and spiritual power are of high value to light infantry operations.

869
01:30:23.44 --> 01:30:28.24
What is a spree? A spree to court. It's like the bond, the bond that we have.

870
01:30:29.92 --> 01:30:38.08
So there's not much clarification on spiritual power. I'm going to go out

871
01:30:38.08 --> 01:30:44.64
on a limb and say that the team has to believe in what they're doing. If you're going to be

872
01:30:44.64 --> 01:30:48.64
successful, if the team doesn't believe in what they're doing, it's going to be a problem.

873
01:30:48.64 --> 01:30:52.80
Because we are not willing to make sacrifices for things we don't believe in.

874
01:30:57.04 --> 01:31:03.68
Light infantry men usually leave no casualties on the battlefield. I like that.

875
01:31:03.68 --> 01:31:08.72
It could be a little bit stronger than usually. Almost never.

876
01:31:10.72 --> 01:31:16.32
And that's different from the army saying of leave no man behind and actually that's all

877
01:31:16.32 --> 01:31:22.08
services say that. And that's always the goal. But you also have to make a call sometimes.

878
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.84
And that might be, hey, we need to back off right now. We need to come back and reattach this

879
01:31:29.84 --> 01:31:34.48
position later. Because right now if we keep going to try and recover this individual,

880
01:31:35.36 --> 01:31:36.80
we're all gonna die.

881
01:31:41.52 --> 01:31:47.20
Light infantry men look to their leaders at 4 a clear voice for clear voice instructions and

882
01:31:47.20 --> 01:31:52.16
thrive on the motivation of visually observing their leaders in action.

883
01:31:54.24 --> 01:31:54.48
Cool.

884
01:31:54.48 --> 01:32:01.84
Necessary sometimes. Clear voice instructions absolutely. Sometimes the team

885
01:32:01.84 --> 01:32:05.76
actually has to see what you're doing and they will take action based on your performance.

886
01:32:06.80 --> 01:32:10.24
They will be inspired and motivated by seeing up. Looks like we're going

887
01:32:12.56 --> 01:32:19.52
in the last one, a light infantry leader can do everything a soldier can do and more.

888
01:32:19.52 --> 01:32:36.16
Now listen, on that one, you're not going to be able to do a hundred percent of what your

889
01:32:36.16 --> 01:32:42.32
frontline troops can do. And you definitely might not be able, you certainly might not be able

890
01:32:42.32 --> 01:32:46.48
to do more. Right? You've snipers gonna be better at shooting with you. The radio man's gonna

891
01:32:46.48 --> 01:32:50.80
do more about the radio than you. The point man's gonna understand the route better than you do.

892
01:32:53.04 --> 01:32:57.20
So that's a little bit. Not sure I agree with that.

893
01:32:58.24 --> 01:33:01.04
It should be a little, you shouldn't know how to do it. You know how to do all those things,

894
01:33:01.04 --> 01:33:05.76
but you're not going to be the expert. But you should absolutely do more.

895
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:15.04
If you're in a leadership position, you should do more. More work, more effort, more sweat,

896
01:33:15.04 --> 01:33:20.24
more toil, and grind, and more exertion because you work for them.

897
01:33:23.76 --> 01:33:32.96
And that's what a leader does. So there you go. That's the document. Short, sweet,

898
01:33:32.96 --> 01:33:41.84
proverbs of the light infantry. Good things to think about applies to many aspects of life.

899
01:33:41.84 --> 01:33:50.40
You disagreed with a few things. The amount that you disagree with is actually pretty small when

900
01:33:50.40 --> 01:33:56.88
you consider. This was written 50 something years ago. That's pretty impressive staying power

901
01:33:56.88 --> 01:34:00.96
as far as all those concepts go. Yep. And I don't know if we'll ever hear from major Scott

902
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:06.96
R. Mick Michael, US Army. But if we do, I'm sure he could clarify some of these and explain him

903
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:14.40
in a different tone or a different aspects or perspective that I don't understand. Also, you know,

904
01:34:14.40 --> 01:34:22.56
the time that it's written in 1980 something, 1985 maybe. So my guess is as a major,

905
01:34:23.20 --> 01:34:28.64
he probably wasn't likely wasn't in Vietnam unless he was an enlisted guy in Vietnam,

906
01:34:28.64 --> 01:34:34.08
just doing the timeline. So maybe bounce in these things off the wars and Iraq and Afghanistan would

907
01:34:34.08 --> 01:34:41.28
actually, I think if we discussed him, I think we would come to some kind of resolution on some

908
01:34:41.28 --> 01:34:46.16
of these, you know, maybe that I didn't understand it correctly or I didn't see what the perspective

909
01:34:46.16 --> 01:34:51.20
that he was talking about. So, you know, and he might also be like, yeah, you know what,

910
01:34:51.20 --> 01:34:58.16
I didn't fully, I didn't fully calculate that aspect of it. Yeah. So, but yeah, I mean, the vast majority

911
01:34:58.16 --> 01:35:04.88
of them are very, I'm in total agreement with. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of times when those, when the language

912
01:35:04.88 --> 01:35:12.40
is that of always and never. So that tends to make it the very least feel like, okay,

913
01:35:12.40 --> 01:35:20.96
there are no real exceptions to that. And then as time goes on, you can start to see the exceptions.

914
01:35:20.96 --> 01:35:25.84
And then, you know, how one exception kind of can kind of open the flood gates for others, you know,

915
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:29.28
and you're like, oh, wait, we're seeing this exception kind of often, oh, shoot, we should maybe

916
01:35:29.28 --> 01:35:37.12
re-valuate or update that always. Yeah. It's like often, often or, you know, tens not to or something like this,

917
01:35:37.12 --> 01:35:44.16
you know, got to be careful with always never. Got to. Thanks. All right. Well, speaking of doing more,

918
01:35:45.60 --> 01:35:51.44
it seems like we should do more, more work, more effort, more toil. Yeah. You said something

919
01:35:51.44 --> 01:35:58.32
really interesting right there at the end. So you work for them. Yeah. It's not as intuitive as one might

920
01:35:58.32 --> 01:36:03.68
think when you're in the position, you know, it's a leader. It seems like they work for you. If you don't

921
01:36:03.68 --> 01:36:09.12
have that intuition, you need to write that on your, you know, on the cover of your notebook. Yeah.

922
01:36:10.08 --> 01:36:15.76
So I have kids and that's another one, right? Where it's kind of like, it's almost like, it's not,

923
01:36:15.76 --> 01:36:19.60
I don't want to say intuitive because intuitive is wrong. We're more like on the surface. Like on the

924
01:36:19.60 --> 01:36:26.96
surface, the kids got to listen to you, you know, but no, like you're the one who you're essentially

925
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:32.000
working for them. You're a job to get them up to speed, you know, all this stuff. Yeah.

926
01:36:33.68 --> 01:36:37.76
I don't know. It's weird. No, there comes a point when they're going to be working for you doing

927
01:36:37.76 --> 01:36:47.76
them dishes. I'm cleaning and catching. I'm not ignoring the benefits of the kids doing the

928
01:36:47.76 --> 01:36:55.12
dishes instead of me now. I'm not ignoring the benefits of that. But that's not why you teach

929
01:36:55.12 --> 01:36:59.92
your kids to do the dishes so they can do them for you, you know? That's not the primary reason.

930
01:36:59.92 --> 01:37:04.88
It's not the primary, well, it may be the primary reason, but it's not the most important reason.

931
01:37:07.36 --> 01:37:13.92
Okay, my, well, emphasis on the word might not love that. So like, I never, like, I always feel bad.

932
01:37:13.92 --> 01:37:19.68
So let's say, okay, so one of my kids has a chore. It's real, by the way. So one of my kids has a list of

933
01:37:19.68 --> 01:37:24.48
chores. I've noticed that a lot of your hypothetical situations are just real.

934
01:37:26.88 --> 01:37:33.04
Yes, yes, yes, you give a lot of, let's say there's by the way, this is real. Okay, so let's just call

935
01:37:33.04 --> 01:37:37.20
it what it is. But there's a reason I do it only because I don't need you asking all these very

936
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:41.68
specific questions necessarily, not necessarily you, but other people ask me these specific

937
01:37:41.68 --> 01:37:46.40
questions and then now on a rack yourself out. Yeah, well, there might be that too. But I,

938
01:37:47.28 --> 01:37:50.96
I usually am looking for the answer that applies to more than just me in my solidest of

939
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:55.36
existence. You're trying to broaden the expansive your question, trying to get a check.

940
01:37:56.16 --> 01:38:02.80
So always appreciate it. If let's say the chores are to one of the chores is to

941
01:38:04.72 --> 01:38:10.72
load the dishwasher. Okay, put all the dirt dishes in the dishwasher. But let's say this child,

942
01:38:10.72 --> 01:38:14.72
um, didn't eat dinner with us. They went out with their friends for dinner. They came home. They

943
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:19.44
got to do their chores every night. Yeah. Meanwhile, they got to load the dishwasher all our dishes.

944
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:23.52
All the people, you know, it doesn't seem right. It just on the surface it just seems like all this

945
01:38:23.52 --> 01:38:28.32
kind of wrong, you know. Doesn't seem right to who me. Oh, making them do that. Okay,

946
01:38:28.72 --> 01:38:32.32
like it's like, what are you my servant? Now you got to clean up my mess. You didn't even

947
01:38:32.32 --> 01:38:36.96
participate with me. You know, it's like they kind of feels that way for me. Echo Charles the Merciful.

948
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:44.56
But there's a bigger picture than that. Yeah. Where his job is that for a reason. It's not to clean

949
01:38:44.56 --> 01:38:51.36
up after me. It's to teach him that in life like these things have to be right. Like things that

950
01:38:51.36 --> 01:38:56.000
you can do, you know, to function. So it goes beyond that big of a skill. So you got to suck it up, you know.

951
01:38:56.96 --> 01:39:03.44
Yeah. Yeah. But also you need to explain why. Right. You need to explain why. Yeah. And if you

952
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:07.76
explain the why, then they go, yeah, you know what that makes sense. Yeah. You can't say because I told

953
01:39:07.76 --> 01:39:13.04
you do. You can't say because I'm the dad. Need to say, well, here's what's going on. Yeah.

954
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.24
Boom. Ask them what you call it. Yeah. I think it's this is the technique in sales where you ask

955
01:39:18.24 --> 01:39:24.40
them like questions with only one answer, you know, like, or it's basically this like if you

956
01:39:24.40 --> 01:39:29.20
they say, why kind of eat this cup cake or whatever. And I'll be like, hey, you know, cup cakes aren't

957
01:39:29.20 --> 01:39:32.80
good for you, right? And usually that just goes right over their head. It likes not good for me. Really

958
01:39:32.80 --> 01:39:37.84
because it seems really good right now, you know, as far as I'm concerned. So I'm like, okay,

959
01:39:37.84 --> 01:39:42.64
if this cup cake makes you less healthy, less the healthy other person. And one of my jobs

960
01:39:42.64 --> 01:39:48.16
on my many is to look up for you, your well-being and your health. And I allow you to eat this cup

961
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:53.84
cake, would I be being a good dad? They can never say yes. Sometimes I'll say yes as a joke. But they understand.

962
01:39:53.84 --> 01:39:58.08
But they know what's up. You know, put the cup cake down. You know, explaining why I'm doing what I'm

963
01:39:58.08 --> 01:40:05.52
doing. Whether it's quickly biting off the frost like what is frosting anyways? I think sugar butter

964
01:40:06.56 --> 01:40:10.96
a lot of butter and sugar. And then there's like, I don't know if some vanilla, maybe some cream or

965
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:20.96
salt. It takes most I would say 70% of the cakes I've eaten in my life were only the cake itself not

966
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:26.08
good. But the first thing when I was a little kid, right? Yeah, yeah. I wanted to get that corner

967
01:40:26.08 --> 01:40:30.48
piece that was had frosting on the floor. It's the first time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, good. Right?

968
01:40:30.48 --> 01:40:35.12
Were you in that game? Or were you taking a middle piece that had one side of frosting? Yeah. So oddly

969
01:40:35.12 --> 01:40:40.16
and when I was a kid, yes, but as I grew up, it's probably just a maturity thing. Really? You know,

970
01:40:40.16 --> 01:40:44.16
you know, like, I like less, less frosting. You didn't matured of that. I didn't mature out of that.

971
01:40:44.16 --> 01:40:49.04
Yeah. In fact, I, you know, I won't want to eat the cake because that's we know that's just

972
01:40:49.04 --> 01:40:52.80
weakness, right? Yeah, put the frosting that's where the stranger like, you know what, I don't even

973
01:40:52.80 --> 01:40:59.28
need to eat the cake. But maybe a little knife, snatch full of freaking frosting, which I don't

974
01:40:59.28 --> 01:41:04.08
even know what it was until you just told me. Yeah. Well, I understand. So there you go. It makes sense

975
01:41:04.08 --> 01:41:07.92
as opposed to say the brownies where you want the middle piece of the brownie because that's a

976
01:41:07.92 --> 01:41:12.96
softer one. Oh, I like the brownie that's a little bit like the hardened part, you know,

977
01:41:12.96 --> 01:41:16.32
around. Oh, so do you like the edges? Yeah, I guess it depends on the name when you're a kid,

978
01:41:16.32 --> 01:41:20.80
like when I'm just, this is all just when I was a kid, you know, you're just in the game, right?

979
01:41:20.80 --> 01:41:25.44
You just, you're tracking sugar like a little addict. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to pee

980
01:41:25.44 --> 01:41:29.44
Roberts's level. Did you hear? Yeah. When pee Roberts was talking about having damp,

981
01:41:30.32 --> 01:41:35.12
sugar cubes hidden in a tensile hole, they're hidden in his room. Yeah, that's going hard. He's

982
01:41:35.12 --> 01:41:41.76
going hard for sure. Like that's, that's some weird phrase. Yeah. You're definitely the guy looks

983
01:41:41.76 --> 01:41:45.44
against a look on his face where it comes to sweet and stuff. Look, I got a sweet,

984
01:41:45.44 --> 01:41:51.12
she's sure what I have her man. He starts losing his mind, bro. Yeah. Oh, that's right. That's

985
01:41:51.12 --> 01:41:55.36
where we had that guy. He wasn't on the podcast. It was when we were up and up in Montana.

986
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.76
And he was starting going all sugar crazy on me. Started getting the wildfires.

987
01:41:59.76 --> 01:42:03.20
So I get crazy. I was both talking about sugar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

988
01:42:03.20 --> 01:42:08.96
Man. That's why he's a good test for Jockel fuel because he's got to sweet a legit, like certified

989
01:42:08.96 --> 01:42:15.04
lifelong sweet tooth. Yeah. We're talking in a crackhead of that's got sugar cubes. Yeah.

990
01:42:15.04 --> 01:42:19.44
And he gets a weird twinkle in his eye when he starts talking about he's sugar cubes. He's a

991
01:42:19.44 --> 01:42:23.92
good test for Jockel fuel because he's not in here going, you know, it tastes pretty good. Like he will

992
01:42:23.92 --> 01:42:31.20
straight reject something. Yeah. If it doesn't, if it doesn't have that sweet little kicker,

993
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:35.44
it's true. He's not down for the cause Pete Roberts. Oh, yeah. And you get a health person who's

994
01:42:35.44 --> 01:42:40.40
down always down for the, you know, playing chicken breasts and broccoli and all this stuff. That guy

995
01:42:40.40 --> 01:42:45.84
who's like down for that kind of stuff and then he's going to taste some, you know, some peanut butter

996
01:42:45.84 --> 01:42:51.92
chocolate, malk or whatever. And the thing is not where it needs to be sweetness flavor. Why is

997
01:42:51.92 --> 01:42:55.20
he's going to be like, oh yeah, man. That's pretty interesting. He's a chicken breast broccoli guy. He's

998
01:42:55.20 --> 01:43:00.40
that. Wow. Man. This is amazing. Might be a little too sweet. Pete Roberts like, you know,

999
01:43:00.40 --> 01:43:05.04
if you don't, if you don't knock it out of the park with Pete, he, you know, he's like whatever.

1000
01:43:05.04 --> 01:43:11.68
You know, he's over there freaking crawling around looking for sugar. You just pop the crack up.

1001
01:43:11.68 --> 01:43:19.36
Oh, he's doing a piece. He's doing great. Speaking of jacophu, what do we got? Yeah. So

1002
01:43:19.36 --> 01:43:24.24
yeah, forget about the cupcakes and all this stuff or whatever. You know, if, if we know

1003
01:43:24.24 --> 01:43:30.96
that eating cupcakes, sugar, butter, frosting, brownies, sugar cubes, if we know that that's bad

1004
01:43:30.96 --> 01:43:37.92
for us makes us less healthy. And we have to be more healthy to be more capable to help the

1005
01:43:37.92 --> 01:43:47.20
people that we work for. Yeah. We still eat this stuff. Are we being a good leader? Good leader,

1006
01:43:47.20 --> 01:43:54.96
good dad, good mom, good parent, good friend, good brother, good sister, good compatriot, good human

1007
01:43:54.96 --> 01:44:00.000
being good sisters freaking no nude. Negative answers freaking negative. And I get it things tastes

1008
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.96
good, I guess one. Good news. I got good news across the board. Okay, first off, before we get to the

1009
01:44:04.96 --> 01:44:09.68
two good of the news, the great news. Maybe some guidelines. Okay, we want to be working out

1010
01:44:09.68 --> 01:44:14.72
we want to stay healthy. We want to stay capable. We want to stay mentally and physically

1011
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:19.76
in the game. We'll say we're going to stand in this earth. We're all on. All right. So you might

1012
01:44:19.76 --> 01:44:24.64
need some supplementation. I'll help you. Big time. Chocolate supplement. If you're going hard,

1013
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:28.16
I'm going to say you're going to need supplementation. Yeah. If you're going hard, you're going to

1014
01:44:28.16 --> 01:44:33.12
need supplementation. If you're pushing hard, you're going to need supplements. Yep. And we got a bunch.

1015
01:44:33.12 --> 01:44:38.80
So let's start with a physical and cognitive discipline. It's the name discipline. Many modes

1016
01:44:38.80 --> 01:44:44.96
get the energy drink. We'll home ready to drink cans. No, let's just go I guess. The the

1017
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:52.16
capsules and the powder called discipline. So the energy drink cans, they're available in multiple

1018
01:44:52.16 --> 01:45:01.92
places. Wow. He's close. He's close. Jocophonefuel.com online. Vitamin shop. Is that everywhere?

1019
01:45:01.92 --> 01:45:06.64
Yep. Worldwide. World shop. Boom. There you go. Only in America. But yeah, it's the boom.

1020
01:45:06.64 --> 01:45:10.56
Multiple options as far as the where to get it. This is just energy drink cans. Vitamin

1021
01:45:10.56 --> 01:45:14.48
shop has everything else. Yeah. This is all that we're about to talk about. Okay. So what are

1022
01:45:14.48 --> 01:45:19.04
those things? Other supplementation joint warfare. A joint warfare and superkilled oil. This

1023
01:45:19.04 --> 01:45:23.44
is for your joints and some general health stuff in there as well. That'll keep you in the game

1024
01:45:23.44 --> 01:45:30.64
big time, especially on the on the physical front. Also, vitamin D3 and cold war for immunity.

1025
01:45:30.64 --> 01:45:34.88
Stay in the game. Don't worry about getting sick anymore. That's a thing. You start over training.

1026
01:45:34.88 --> 01:45:39.04
That's sleeping enough. All this stuff. Right. Sickness will come and get you. Take you out for a little

1027
01:45:39.04 --> 01:45:45.84
while. If you just let that happen, are you being a good leader? Are you? No. That's good. You're

1028
01:45:45.84 --> 01:45:50.48
letting down everybody. You're kind of nervous. That was this book. You read it on podcast.

1029
01:45:51.68 --> 01:45:56.64
And it really, this thing stuck with me because I kind of had this inkling of this concept.

1030
01:45:56.64 --> 01:46:00.64
But I never could really arrive at it and embrace it as much until I heard it. Where it's like,

1031
01:46:00.64 --> 01:46:06.80
it's like, I forget the exact words, but it said, like, if you get sick, that's kind of your

1032
01:46:06.80 --> 01:46:11.68
phone. Don't let your own thing affect the team kind of thing. It was like, oh, it was one of these

1033
01:46:11.68 --> 01:46:17.44
things. Where it's kind of like, if you get, it was kind of kind of raw because sometimes,

1034
01:46:17.44 --> 01:46:21.76
right, you just get sick. You get it. It does happen. Dissentry or something to think. You know,

1035
01:46:21.76 --> 01:46:25.52
it's like, sure, you can take measures to try to avoid it. But sometimes, on avoidable,

1036
01:46:25.52 --> 01:46:29.92
this in the book you read and was like, still, that's your bad. Don't let that jerk. Was that?

1037
01:46:29.92 --> 01:46:34.32
I forget. But it was like, man, your personal shit. Don't, don't even come over here with that stuff.

1038
01:46:34.32 --> 01:46:38.96
You better keep, keep moving kind of a thing. Chuck. It's like, dang it. Trying to figure out what

1039
01:46:38.96 --> 01:46:44.32
book that was, we'll, we'll go back to it. Yeah. But it was, it is interesting. So let's say we

1040
01:46:44.32 --> 01:46:50.08
apply that philosophy. Boom. We got some measures, some significant measures. That's a vitamin D.

1041
01:46:50.96 --> 01:46:57.28
Three, by the way. And also the Cold War for you, me and any boom. Also, the good news that I was

1042
01:46:57.28 --> 01:47:03.28
about to present, we got protein supplementation, but we don't need cupcakes anymore. It replaces

1043
01:47:03.28 --> 01:47:12.32
the cupcakes and the frosting. Don't need frosting certified, accepted taste by Pete Roberts,

1044
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:17.36
the sugar cube addict. It's just a good thing in this case, as far as like, what do you call

1045
01:47:17.36 --> 01:47:24.80
credentials? Yeah. So yes, best tasting protein on the market. Straight up in the world. Yeah.

1050
01:47:45.36 --> 01:47:51.20
We got big companies out there that are like shipping stuff for free, which is good. They have

1053
01:48:02.56 --> 01:48:08.000
light infantry mindset going against the big heavy hitters out there. It's true. That's a big deal

1054
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.52
of free shipping. Sometimes some of us, you know, when we check out, we see a free shipping.

1055
01:48:14.24 --> 01:48:19.60
That's nice. That's it. In it. So yeah. Also, do you just have stuff? Because we're doing

1056
01:48:19.60 --> 01:48:25.44
you just enough. We're back in the game. We're back. Coronavirus. I remember that. Yeah.

1057
01:48:25.44 --> 01:48:31.12
You know, that was a thing back in the day. But we're back to in GG2. So you need some GG2

1058
01:48:31.12 --> 01:48:36.96
G's, rash guards, other equipment. Go to origin. USA.com. That's where you can get them.

1059
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:42.000
It's all American made stuff. Yeah. And just stuff for like wearing too. Like things to cover

1060
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.40
your legs in called pants. The best pants ever. You know, Delta jeans. Get factory jeans too.

1061
01:48:48.40 --> 01:48:52.24
If you're living up north, we understand. You're probably going to get the factory jeans. They're

1062
01:48:52.24 --> 01:48:56.56
heavier. If you're living down south or you're living out the west coast, you're probably

1063
01:48:56.56 --> 01:49:04.24
looking at the Delta 68 jeans and boots. You get boots. Yeah. Are they doing that wallet? Or

1064
01:49:04.24 --> 01:49:08.64
the SP kind of flexing on us? Do you want to do it? Yeah. There's a couple versions of the

1065
01:49:08.64 --> 01:49:14.32
wallet. There's like that reals. What a slim. Yeah. Minimal. Whatever. Pied called it concealed care.

1066
01:49:17.12 --> 01:49:21.28
Yeah. Yeah. You guys, you guys up there all cracked out on sugar cubes. What is

1067
01:49:21.28 --> 01:49:30.24
a continued carry wallet? Probably one. But like it is cool because every time like because

1068
01:49:30.24 --> 01:49:33.92
a wallet, you don't just automatically think, or I don't anyway, but when you will help us

1069
01:49:33.92 --> 01:49:38.000
it out, you can tell like, you know, you took some pride in that one. Do it. So they put out some

1070
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.96
cool stuff. Yeah. No, well, P takes massive pride in the whole process from designing it and

1071
01:49:44.96 --> 01:49:48.88
then the functionality of it and then the production of it. Yeah. Because think about, think about

1072
01:49:48.88 --> 01:49:56.56
something's going from his head. From his head to people's hands passing through the company

1073
01:49:56.56 --> 01:50:03.92
being built by the factory. Like it's awesome. So the whole, everyone there, everyone there

1074
01:50:03.92 --> 01:50:08.08
when a wallet goes and when a pair of boots goes out, everybody there's pride all over that stuff.

1075
01:50:08.08 --> 01:50:12.56
Yeah. It's like you got to represent, right? You can't just be throwing in some half thought

1076
01:50:12.56 --> 01:50:16.88
idea and be like, hey, try this and then show everybody. It's like, bro, we're not doing that

1077
01:50:16.88 --> 01:50:20.72
and stuff. We're going to all of them. Yeah. That's what we're doing. We're not throwing something

1078
01:50:20.72 --> 01:50:26.80
together. This is all in cereal. So is P proud? Yeah. Is every person that's on the line creating

1079
01:50:26.80 --> 01:50:33.28
this stuff proud? Hell yeah. It's freaking legit. Makes sense. Also speaking of legit, Jacoa's star,

1080
01:50:33.28 --> 01:50:38.08
this one equals freedom, shirts and hats and hoodies. Some match cards on there. Um, some more

1081
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:42.96
kids stuff on there. Some soap on there. Jaco's soap, trooper soap, killer soap and the bacterial

1082
01:50:42.96 --> 01:50:51.60
charcoal activated. So, sorry. So, oh, this stuff. Um, yeah. So if you want to represent,

1083
01:50:51.60 --> 01:50:57.20
while you're on this path, you know, this is where you can, you can get your attire, your gear.

1084
01:50:57.20 --> 01:51:02.88
Also, we have a subscription situation there too. shirts. Interesting designs. Creative.

1085
01:51:02.88 --> 01:51:06.64
You're wearing one right now. If you want to go on YouTube and look at the current shirt that

1086
01:51:06.64 --> 01:51:11.20
echo Charles is wearing. Unableable, by the way, you missed it. A lot of people have it,

1087
01:51:11.20 --> 01:51:15.60
you know, they're representing. But here's the thing, every time you're learning and you're coming

1088
01:51:15.60 --> 01:51:22.72
up with more dope designs. Sure. I tried to keep a standard quality level. Whatever. Either way,

1089
01:51:22.72 --> 01:51:27.84
it's fun. Um, yes, it's called the shirt lockers. So yeah, man, sign up for that. You know, if you're

01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:46.40
crazy with those. Getting nuts, as they say, but they'll freaking awesome feedback. We'll

1093
01:51:46.40 --> 01:51:50.64

1095
01:52:00.32 --> 01:52:09.04
platform that we are, we have created so that we have control if contingencies unfold that we need

1096
01:52:09.04 --> 01:52:14.96
to execute an alternative platform. We're not doing it. We hope to not do it. But things are strange

1097
01:52:14.96 --> 01:52:21.84
in the world. So Jaco on a ground.com, if you want to help support the the alternate world,

1098
01:52:21.84 --> 01:52:28.24
if needed, you can you can pay $8.18 a month. And we're doing like a unadditional podcast where we talk

1099
01:52:28.24 --> 01:52:34.64
about it. Just really interesting stuff. That's not quite Jaco podcast material, but it's Jaco

1100
01:52:34.64 --> 01:52:44.72
life material. Alternative and amplifying information. Yeah, and look, if you just, if you can't

1101
01:52:44.72 --> 01:52:50.24
afford that, no factor. Email assistance at jockelwinderground.com. We're just trying to make

1102
01:52:50.24 --> 01:52:55.28
sure we're taking care of and your taken care of. Should things start to go sideways. We also have

1103
01:52:55.28 --> 01:53:01.92
a YouTube channel where I and the assistant director for some awesome videos and then echo put some

1104
01:53:01.92 --> 01:53:07.52
videos on there too. Unraveling is on there too. By the way, all of them? No, but they're they're

1105
01:53:07.52 --> 01:53:12.64
getting rolled out as well. Yeah, I've got a new one up there. That's good to hear. Yeah, those

1106
01:53:12.64 --> 01:53:19.20
unraveling podcasts. I can't be interested to read the comments on those. Yeah, so that's a thing

1107
01:53:19.20 --> 01:53:26.88
because those really run the risk and they have a head like a, no, YouTube will fly it because

1108
01:53:26.88 --> 01:53:31.84
of the material. Anytime you and Darrell Cooper start talking about genocides and all the, you know,

1109
01:53:31.84 --> 01:53:37.12
the brutal, we're selling it on deep of history and you know, whatever it's like YouTube's like,

1110
01:53:37.12 --> 01:53:42.16
oh, you pump your brakes there. One time we were talking about something and Darrell's like,

1111
01:53:42.16 --> 01:53:47.20
you know, this is this particular thing is really bad and it's just not appropriate. No,

1112
01:53:47.20 --> 01:53:50.56
not what you want to hear in a podcast. We got Donald's like, Hey, bro, I don't never want to hear

1113
01:53:50.56 --> 01:53:54.64
that again. He's like, I'll never say it again. Like, that's what we're doing. You know, if we don't

1114
01:53:54.64 --> 01:54:00.72
address, if we don't address and inform people about what happens when things go sideways,

1115
01:54:00.72 --> 01:54:06.64
then people will realize how bad it is. That's what happens. So yeah, we're getting flagged,

1116
01:54:06.64 --> 01:54:11.60
getting censored, must be 18 or older. You'd think that we were putting out freaking pornographic

1117
01:54:11.60 --> 01:54:17.68
material. We're not. We're talking about what communism does. We're talking about what authoritarian

1118
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:24.32
governments can do. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't, it never got, you know, deep into history in high school

1119
01:54:24.32 --> 01:54:28.80
and all this stuff or whatever, but kind of the thing of this is going to be known news to you,

1120
01:54:28.80 --> 01:54:34.40
obviously, but when you do presented in such an interesting way or whatever, it one of the many

1121
01:54:34.40 --> 01:54:38.72
valuable things you can get from it is like, yeah, you realize how bad it was back then. And at

1122
01:54:38.72 --> 01:54:44.64
the same time by contrast, you realize, oh, today isn't that bad. Even the bad stuff that happens

1123
01:54:44.64 --> 01:54:49.36
like, man, you kind of compare to the whole of the thing. It starts to, it starts to offer this,

1124
01:54:49.36 --> 01:54:53.60
this may be more enlightened perspective on things. Well, yeah, and it also offers you

1125
01:54:55.84 --> 01:55:02.08
an understanding of why things are happening and how things happen. Because look, just like

1126
01:55:02.08 --> 01:55:08.16
leadership is something that you can learn about from the past, so is everything else and to

1127
01:55:08.16 --> 01:55:14.24
sit here and think that we're in a you totally unique time. And that nothing like this is ever

1128
01:55:14.24 --> 01:55:21.36
happened before. It'll be different this time. That's freaking wrong. That's just wrong. The way that

1129
01:55:21.36 --> 01:55:26.16
the world works, the way human nature works doesn't change. And there might be different technology,

1130
01:55:26.16 --> 01:55:31.12
but just like technology won't make the difference in light infantry battle, technology will not

1131
01:55:31.12 --> 01:55:36.08
change human nature. It'll have influence over it. But we need to watch out for what we need to

1132
01:55:36.08 --> 01:55:43.36
watch out for. Human nature inherently does the same things over and over again. So let's be careful.

1133
01:55:44.24 --> 01:55:48.88
Check out the unraveling. Check out Darryl Cooper's podcast, Margar made. Right now there's a lot

1134
01:55:48.88 --> 01:55:52.48
of there's a flare up going on in the middle east. You want to get the background on that. You

1135
01:55:52.48 --> 01:55:56.64
want to try and you want to get some understanding of what's going on in the middle east. You don't

1136
01:55:56.64 --> 01:56:01.76
know. I'm going to tell you you don't know. And I studied the middle east and the conflicts in

1137
01:56:01.76 --> 01:56:10.48
the middle east. Darryl Cooper's podcast, Margar made is a doctorate in what happened in the

let's face it. It's hard to understand what's happened. You're looking at it. You're seeing

1144
01:56:51.28 --> 01:56:55.84
some words. You're hearing about the story. You're kind of wondering what the hell is this about. So
