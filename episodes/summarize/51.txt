and I'll be home whatever I hope every house Johnny's you know grades in kindergarten let's talk about that how's it how's he like in his jiu jitsu class is he working on his armac houses communal look let's stick to those subjects not gonna all crazy all right now this is uh he starts going into a description of what some of the guys were like has now he spent some time with any he's getting to know them back to the book I started to get to know my men like most people my age I've been brought up on Hollywood's idea of a marine platoon a demographically ethnically balanced blend of wasps and the rest of us you know a Brooklyn jiu street wise but sensitive a big city Italian talking baseball and making of seam arm gestures behind your back a dumb hayseed farm boy with a girl back home a heroic black man a Puerto Rican or Mexican with a rosary muddering Spanish wisdom a feisty little Jimmy Cagni Irishman with a chip on his shoulder a goulosh of stereotypes the reality in Korea was somewhat different my platoon had no jiu's one black no Hispanics one Indian certainly and so on there were Protestants and Catholics and few who are nothing and that was it some Irish some polls some Italians a few French and the Irish were sober and it was the Midwest roobs who got emotional while the Italians were being my fodical and flagmatic nor were the battalion officers what the Marine Corps had traditionally been southern gentlemen now we were easterners Ivy Leagueers college kids California's Californians men from Detroit and Chicago and Seattle so a little different from what you might imagine not quite as diverse as they made it out to be in Hollywood now going to a little more detail about a rifle platoon in the Marine Corps in Korea back to the book a marine rifle platoon in Korea was a superbly balanced tactical unit with enormous firepower and an eminently sensible fundamental premise eminently sensible fundamental premise in combat no one man can reasonably be expected to control directly and effectively more than three other men in a firefight you can't keep tabs on more than three Marines and still be aware of the enemy a marine rifle platoon has three squads whose squad leaders are trained to maintain contact with the platoon leader when he issues orders he issues them not to 40 men but only to these three sergeants in their turn each control three fire teams each of which is commanded by a corporal fire team leader they look to the squad leader for their orders he to them for action in the fire team the corporal has three men whom he controls and who look always to him during a firefight oh we got a guy that started losing a little bit get him off the line give him a break give him a rest and the big thing that winners points out dick winners i'm talking band of brothers first the five o'clock one of the things that he put points out is if you get the guy off the line they they'd come back they'll be okay if you don't and you grind them out it's like having an engine that's low on oil if you get it to the service station they'll just put more oil in there come back it's going to it's going to be fine if you keep driving that thing dry on oil it's going to be destroyed and that's the same thing that can happen with with people with people's minds you know see some more minds get start to become affected by this back to the book Kelso the machine gunner lost a man it wasn't the gooks that did it but the wind we'd been on the line three weeks and the wind never stopped one night Kelso's corporal went berserk firing off a heavy machine gun inside the bunker trying to kill rats that no one else saw they carried him off in the morning cursing the wind and the rats jooling and trying to tear off his clothes prints and looked at him foughtfully i was shaken by the sounds coming from a good marine a solid nco so again both these guys danker and this this guy right here they're good marines that just couldn't they just got they just had enough and they need to get off the line they need to break back to the book we lost other men only fits Gerald squad did not lose anyone fits would not permit himself to be evacuated the morning i trip the mind and he would not permit his men to quit he was tough but he was more than that he was the best we had and his men knew it and they refused to weaken even when weakness closed in on them fits Gerald drove them and they drove themselves that's such a great indicator of what leadership is all these other people losing people people are going crazy but that's just just getting after it fall on I don't know what else to say so now what they use they call in fire they call in their own fire the 105's 105 artillery stay low the 105's are coming in they shuddle in very loud to smash into the hill sides above us I could feel the yolk jerk under me I thought maybe I should pray and I started to hail marries but I never finished one short as they were I would start and then another three shells would come and over me and bang into the hill and shake me like a rat my body was trying to absorb the shock and I forgot where I was in the prayer and had to start again I stopped watching the shells come it was too much watching them and worrying and I just laid there as flat as I could my dirt in the face my my face in the dirt shoulders hunched and my next screw down tight between them trying to squeeze me more more of me into the helmet shells came in like that for maybe three or four minutes you couldn't really judge time it had no meaning in a situation like that dirt fell likely lightly on us feeling wonderful being only dirt and pebbles and not hot metal then the gun secured I think that short one there's one of the round's fell short I think that short one shook the gunners up to if they're four observers saw it my body was now on the radio give us machine guns on that crest again now the two guns were resumed their chatter with McCarthy shouting keep your heads down and poured on and then the McCarthy yelled orders to the Marines within hearing on three we go one two we were all up and running all of us rabble next to me running uphill but not feeling the grade or being winded or leg weary just sprinting up there were a reans there were Marines all around me some of us some of the wounded must be coming with us going up a second time I didn't recognize anyone but rabble but didn't it didn't matter we were attacking yoke the yoke together in daylight assaulting a hill and we were going to get there I fired without aiming just fired vaguely towards the crests of the hill it felt good to be running and firing I fired again around me there was shouting I picked up the shout no prisoners I yelled no prisoners kill them all that's what I was shouting what the others were shouting everyone took it up now everyone near me anyways it was stupid shouting stuff like that my job was to get prisoners dead chinks couldn't help anyone but it just seemed like the thing to shout at the moment and since it felt good I kept shouting it and so did the others no prisoners now when they get a little bit closer up on the hill now I could see grenades in the air one grenade seemed to be trailing something tied up with rags I couldn't understand that our grenade went off right in front of me stinging both my hands in face dirt it was just dirt fragments of grenades would have been hot I didn't feel anything beyond the stinging so they couldn't have been serious about it just trying to instill a little discipline into three damn full marines he didn't seem angry at being shot at but we stayed in the trench for a hundred yards until it dropped away below the skyline it was all very casual max pleasure being sheld puzzled me one thing to be gun-ho about going to war another to be delighted someone was shooting at you max fired up this is pretty cool talking about the he's getting some education now from one of the one of the enlisted marines named Dodge and Dodge says most of the enemy weapons are Russian and the Russians are pretty smart about weapons their mortars are one millimeter larger in diameter than ours we got sixties and eighty ones they got sixty ones and eighty twos so they can use captured american mortar shells they slide in easy and just a little fraction loose but we can't use their shells they're just a tad too big for our tubes so Soviet unions pretty smart when they came up with that idea with that plan back to the book around three o'clock off the left there was a sudden mash of incoming mortar fire than a distant shouting chaffy just back from a scouting with scouting mission with lisman took off along the ridge towards flint's position I started to go but red Phillips barked to me stay put till we know what happened then Phillips phone rang it was flint four of his men sending themselves on top of a bunker taken a direct hit from an eighty two millimeter mortars of a gooks and thrown up without notice just one shell but two the Marines were dead another had lost both legs and the fourth was badly hold they brought them down past the CP the dead shrouded in ponchos the wounded conscious and in pain I stood watching feeling a stranger one of the dead was cousin to the man whose legs were gone they came from a town in Massachusetts the Marine without legs didn't seem to realize about his legs but he was talking about his cousin poor ready he said what's at his mother gonna say chaffy was with them at the corner at one corner of the four men carrying Eddie in the poncho he turned it over to someone else and went into the CP Phillips and I following get some onus chaffy said tell him to send three men up to flint for tonight to fill in the line tell him to thin out his own people where he can I'll try getting him some more men in the morning he can have my runners if he can't if I can't get anybody else they'll have that bunker and I think that's beneficial in a lot of ways because yeah you know you know what's making guys tick and obviously the down fault of that is that when you do lose guys you are gonna lose a PCU and that's the reality of it now going back to the book he gets another visit from the kernel the kernel comes up on the line so the guy above above Chaffey and the chain of command comes up same thing just looking at his trench in what he's got going on back to the book the kernel said where are your machine guns the answer was I didn't know exactly what I said was they're down with the squads the first squad has won and the second and the lieutenant what bonkers are your machine goes in guns in do you know they're fields of fire how would they late do you have aiming stakes in no sir you should know shouldn't you yes sir then find out I sir the words floated in the crisp cold of the hill as the kernel hop gently into his chopper and left I got on the phone to call Chaffey I told him I thought I'd better since the kernel surely would Chaffey didn't say much over the phone and so I stayed with the battalion the thought of that girl of any girl was immense within me but that was another world those things didn't belong here after five months this battalion these hills these men were what mattered there was a purity of life on the line a crude priesthood of combat that I didn't want a soil for a few days of pleasure you didn't get laid up here you tried not to even model your mind thinking about it I had no religious scouples about it not this time it was as if Japan a trip to Japan would have spoiled something betrayed the battalion and my men and myself I couldn't imagine John Chaffey on a booze run and for me Chaffey was the model so there's he talks about that purity it's a real thing I'm telling you it's a real thing it's a real thing the purity of combat in a war it's a real thing it's a evil thing but there's something about it now things start to springtime comes and things start to fall out but you can it's not all good back to the book the fall brought up green buds and turn the roads to mud here in the valleys on the hills there were snow slides and at the briefing Gregory told us that along the line bunkers were collapsing under the weight of layers of sandbags in one regiment two men were suffocated in one bunker another Marines back was broken when his bunkers slip sideways and slid down the hill Fox company lost a man when he stepped on a mind during a night exercise both legs were blown off at the knee and by the time they got him back to camp and a surgeon he was dead a machine gunner shot his bunk mate with a 45 then one night there was an alert and the battalion moved out fast and trucks to a support position the alert was nothing the gooks never came but a Marine fell out of the one truck and was run over by the truck behind so the war went on no fighting to speak of and yet Marines continued to die the mountains killed them and the cold and now even the fog inspired to kill them and they killed themselves and each other and sometimes the gooks had their turn at it so springtime doesn't even really don't even really mean it's gonna get any better and he was going home the other badly hit man didn't die either only the point man the first marine hit was dead all that firing all that fighting all those people hit and one marine was dead and I couldn't swear to it any of the chinks were dead they got real lucky that's an area back to the book no one i knew who'd been there long enough missed the winter but this fighting in the heat possessed its own dimension of horror you could see the wounds see what killed people the explicit manner of death and injury a leg severed at the knee a mangled arm how startingly white a man's ribs looked sticking out from under a flack jacket the pink at the center splintered ends with little bits of meat attached all winter you were so muffled in clothes layers and layers swaddled against the cold that a man could be all shot to pieces literally sieved but unless you were a corpsman you didn't have to look at the broken bones and the torn flesh and see the blood pulsing from arteries and veins the bodies were just as hurt just as broken but it happened under a couple pairs of pants and an oversized parka men died more neatly in the winter more modestly covered instead of naked and have seen the rip the part those heavy clothes gave death a certain muffled discretion a man could die in decency after the yoke i thought harder and longer about the accident of battle the heads are tail of combat this wasn't the ignorant fear those first weeks of war i knew too much now to be frightened by everything and too much ever to turn smug yet combat was still a great mystery mingled in fear and exaltation a sense of accomplishment offset by neurotic guilt sheer joy at coming through a firefight and nauseating terror wanting to flee the battle you were drawn to its furious center no one who had not thought could possibly imagine the contradictions or the nuances some fled battle and others embraced it that was the enigma i was one of those torn in both directions that caught me of war coming at you from james brady now it starts looking like he's going to get rotated out back to the book there were rumors i wasn't going to be there much longer that if there were a big summer offensive as colonel Gregory kept hinting i wasn't going to be in it but no one had fought to tell him about the two men going back out to retrieve the rope as they came back he took them for gooks trailing the patrol home trying for a straggler and he fired off two short effective bursts he was a very good gunner and he caught both men in the face the rope was coiled neatly over the sergeant's shoulder wind gate was in my machine gun patoon on 749 before being transferred to max patoon not a terribly good marine a brooder most men disliked him one of the few friends he had was the gunner who killed him knowing what losing sergeant and wind gate would mean to mac I called him on the company phone to talk about it he wondered if he should have just left the dam rope out there dangling no matter that the sergeant should have passed word that they were going back out this was max patoon and these his men and their deaths his deaths it carried the body to the supply tent just below the company cp and laid them out the cold would take care of them through the night and in the morning the gook train would come through but when the gooks got there and ate stretcher bears fell out to approach the supply plant tent to pick up the dead and carry them down the hill a marine stopped them the gunner who'd killed wind gate and the sergeant he had sat crying all might in the tent sitting over the bodies and now he stood just outside the tent flap dry eyed but holding a 45 automatic you're not taking them he said the gooks dropped the two stretchers and scattered along the path and both directions crazy marines the stretcher lay on the ice chaffy walked up to the gunner give it here corporal he said you know wind gate wouldn't want you doing that stay back skipper yes it does sir we've got work to do though get some more wire in plot the minds and don't get too relaxed just because it's high any hill marines can climb down the gooks can climb up get relaxed and you'll find trouble I said I wasn't too relaxed Chaffee greeted that with a grin I don't imagine you are first night on the line with a new platoon I laughed it was getting late the sun gone now but Chaffee walked away but Chaffee walked with me for a way the two of us alone not much I want to say Brady you'll do a fine job for me I'm not worried about that but one thing they don't tell you at quannico and maybe they should get to know your people as marines as professionals learn their capacities their strengths their weaknesses but don't get to know them as men none of this first name stuff don't ask about their families or their hometown whether they're married if they've got kids do that and before you know it you'll lose your judgment you'll be sending a man out on point because he's single and not because he's the best point man there's something else get to know your men too well too personally and when you lose one you'll be losing a piece of yourself a platoon leader can't afford that it's bad enough losing men without losing pieces of you too remember that Brady it's hard learned and it's right and we'll go to the book he says two Marines came to their village this morning they shouted for women the people close themselves in their houses and a few ran into the fields the Marines tried to force some doors open but couldn't get in then they went to the house of these two women to the guy has two women with them who are mother and daughter when the women would not open the door the Marines fired their guns in the sky the women were afraid so they opened the Marines went inside and closed the door when they came out they went through the village shouting at the houses and telling people not to tell anyone they had been there or they would kill them this man knows some English words he understood what they said then the Marines left and the people came out it was agreed they should come to tell what happened and to ask for justice that is what he says so obviously these two Marines got that gone into this village break to these women and it's Brady that gets assigned with Mac I believe to investigate all right the Colonel Gregory's at Regiment all assigned you to investigate as investigating officers report to me when you have something he turned back to go back inside the tent one more thing I don't mirror mine Marines being a little wild and I don't much like a gooks but we're not going to have rape this battalion is going to have discipline their Marines we won't have rape he went inside so they do an investigation and it doesn't take Brady long to figure out who these guys were and it was interesting too because when we first got over to one of my first deployment to Iraq man we were learning so many lessons about what was going on one of the biggest was how we were operating in humvies all time because we didn't really do that much before the war started solve us and we were just learning a lesson a day in how to operate with humvies and we just logged it all down and pass it on so the next guys knew what was coming and capture those lessons learned and pass them on and by the way when you're coming into theater and you haven't done the job whatever job some that you're taking over from somebody listen to whatever they're telling you don't go in with your preconceived notions you might have your own ideas that's fine I'm not saying don't have your own ideas but listen to what people are telling you because they're gonna know some things that you don't know and that's all there is to it all right now there's a point where it looks like chaffee's gonna decide which one of these two guys Brady or Mac Allen is gonna get to take over his platoon commander and they're actually gonna do a a coin flip to decide so that's just who it is and I couldn't back off now because the marine just as scary as I was was yelling at me he was guessing that's all I continued to kneel there not really seeing anything anymore not really focusing they ran like men dammit women didn't run like that behind me the marine was still there I could sense him without turning I said go back to your post if you're all that worry don't fire you don't have to fire there was a sort of sob behind me in a scurrying movement I felt funny kneeling there with my back to him the marine was shook armed he could shoot me right here I forced myself to stay where I was then there was another sound as the marine crawled away killer he risked whispered or horsely as if through tears then he was gone and that that situation is actually not it doesn't it doesn't get there's no closure in that situation he doesn't find out doesn't get resolved in the book he does they leave they hit the village they did cause their distraction and then they leave and he never really goes one way or the other and saying or never finds out he suspected they were that they were men but he never finds out and that's you know obviously one young marine thought they were women he thought they were men no one really knows for sure in war is hell now the next thing that happens is Brady actually um uh Brady and Mac they create like a a they're own little special unit
