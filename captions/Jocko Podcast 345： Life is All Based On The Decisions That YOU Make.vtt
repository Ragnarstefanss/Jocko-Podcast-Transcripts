00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.92
This is Jocko podcast number 345 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:03.92 --> 00:00:04.72
Jocko willing.

3
00:00:04.72 --> 00:00:05.40
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:05.40 --> 00:00:06.56
Good evening.

5
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:10.24
So just got back from an event at echelon front,

6
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:12.72
this event that we call the council.

7
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:18.04
And what is we have a small group of about 20 leaders.

8
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:23.000
We do it out in a very remote location in Northeast Washington

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.48
state.

10
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:31.04
And it's an opportunity to really get in depth with some

11
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:34.64
leadership tools with some high level leaders that are running

12
00:00:34.64 --> 00:00:38.76
in most cases, very large organizations.

13
00:00:38.76 --> 00:00:43.04
And when I was up there, I just wanted to share some of what I

14
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:49.48
talked about while I was there and actually one specific idea

15
00:00:49.48 --> 00:00:54.60
that I first conceptualized at the council last year, 2021.

16
00:00:54.60 --> 00:00:57.96
So in 2021, I went up there and essentially what happened was

17
00:00:57.96 --> 00:00:59.24
it was a pretty interesting dynamic.

18
00:00:59.24 --> 00:01:02.000
I get up there and we're sitting down.

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.68
It's a small group.

20
00:01:02.68 --> 00:01:05.24
There's like 15 or 20 people there.

21
00:01:05.24 --> 00:01:10.84
And Leif was telling a story about us being overseas or us

22
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:11.56
going through training.

23
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:14.72
And he kind of told a story where I came in at some point

24
00:01:14.72 --> 00:01:17.20
and made like a leadership decision and boom,

25
00:01:17.20 --> 00:01:19.52
it helped solve whatever the scenario was.

26
00:01:19.52 --> 00:01:21.08
And then Andrew Paul was up there.

27
00:01:21.08 --> 00:01:24.36
And Andrew Paul told a story that was something was going on.

28
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:27.12
And then I came in and kind of made some decision.

29
00:01:27.12 --> 00:01:28.52
And then Leif told another one.

30
00:01:28.52 --> 00:01:32.32
And so for whatever reason, they both told a couple stories

31
00:01:32.32 --> 00:01:36.72
each that were illustrating some leadership point.

32
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:41.60
And in the stories, it made me look

33
00:01:41.60 --> 00:01:44.64
like this decisive good leader, which is cool, great.

34
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:47.000
But of course, we're all telling stories about each other.

35
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.08
But a couple of the leaders that were there,

36
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:54.20
after this one session, they approached me.

37
00:01:54.20 --> 00:01:56.92
And they said something along the lines of,

38
00:01:56.92 --> 00:02:03.24
you just have such great natural leadership instincts.

39
00:02:03.24 --> 00:02:06.20
And of course, my ego is immediately like, oh, hell, yeah.

40
00:02:06.20 --> 00:02:06.96
Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:06.96 --> 00:02:08.56
Yeah, of course.

42
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:10.68
And then we had a quick conversation.

43
00:02:10.68 --> 00:02:13.48
And they just said, oh, it's so cool to hear these stories where

44
00:02:13.48 --> 00:02:15.44
you have these leadership instincts.

45
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:17.08
And I said, yeah, you know, it's pretty cool.

46
00:02:17.08 --> 00:02:17.84
I'm pretty cool.

47
00:02:17.84 --> 00:02:22.92
You know, all kind of that ego, idiocy.

48
00:02:22.92 --> 00:02:27.68
And then as I thought about it, and we were on a break,

49
00:02:27.68 --> 00:02:30.12
and as I thought about it, there was actually a break

50
00:02:30.12 --> 00:02:30.84
at the end of the day.

51
00:02:30.84 --> 00:02:33.68
As I thought about it, I thought, well, that's actually

52
00:02:33.68 --> 00:02:35.04
not cool at all.

53
00:02:35.04 --> 00:02:40.88
Because if my leadership is just some natural instinct,

54
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:43.32
then that implies that it's something

55
00:02:43.32 --> 00:02:44.40
that I can't teach you.

56
00:02:44.40 --> 00:02:45.56
I can't teach you.

57
00:02:45.56 --> 00:02:50.44
I can't teach you something that is only instinctive.

58
00:02:50.44 --> 00:02:56.20
So as I thought about it, I also realized not only is that bad,

59
00:02:56.20 --> 00:02:59.76
but I also realized that there was plenty of times in my life

60
00:02:59.76 --> 00:03:02.12
where, especially when I was younger,

61
00:03:02.12 --> 00:03:04.000
and I didn't have much experience as a leader,

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.48
where I didn't make good decisions,

63
00:03:07.48 --> 00:03:10.60
or I didn't even realize I needed to make a decision.

64
00:03:10.60 --> 00:03:12.72
And so as I'm sitting there thinking about this during

65
00:03:12.72 --> 00:03:18.16
this break, I realized that I had learned to lead,

66
00:03:18.16 --> 00:03:21.000
and I developed knowledge and developed

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.64
kind of a process that was so embedded in my brain

68
00:03:23.64 --> 00:03:25.04
that it seemed like instinct.

69
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:28.12
And when these guys hear the story, it seems like instinct.

70
00:03:28.12 --> 00:03:29.000
But it's not instinct.

71
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.68
It's more of a process.

72
00:03:32.68 --> 00:03:38.64
And so I sat in my room, and I went through and just sort of

73
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:41.76
wrote down the process that I used, the things that I think

74
00:03:41.76 --> 00:03:45.40
about when I'm making a decision.

75
00:03:45.40 --> 00:03:48.32
And since then, I've implemented that and teach it

76
00:03:48.32 --> 00:03:49.68
at Eshalon Front.

77
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:54.08
And I've added a couple things to it since that time frame.

78
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:59.12
And basically call it the extreme ownership leadership loop.

79
00:03:59.12 --> 00:04:01.60
And the reason is because extreme ownership, the book

80
00:04:01.60 --> 00:04:05.04
that Leif and I wrote, that term just kind of encompasses

81
00:04:05.04 --> 00:04:11.48
the broad principles that we try and operate by.

82
00:04:11.48 --> 00:04:13.56
And there's a reason that I use the term loop.

83
00:04:13.56 --> 00:04:16.96
The reason I use the term loop is clearly taken from the OOTA

84
00:04:16.96 --> 00:04:21.44
loop, Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.

85
00:04:21.44 --> 00:04:25.64
And when you are making a decision,

86
00:04:25.64 --> 00:04:30.28
you can utilize that loop, Observe, Orient, Decide,

87
00:04:30.28 --> 00:04:33.40
and Act and what that means is, a real quick brief on that.

88
00:04:33.40 --> 00:04:35.20
First of all, you observe, means you look around

89
00:04:35.20 --> 00:04:36.12
and see what's happening.

90
00:04:36.12 --> 00:04:41.04
Then you orient, you see where you are in what you have

91
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:44.12
observed, then you decide what you should do,

92
00:04:44.12 --> 00:04:45.96
and then you act on it.

93
00:04:45.96 --> 00:04:48.12
And once you've acted, you go back to looking around

94
00:04:48.12 --> 00:04:51.32
and see how your actions impacted what's happening.

95
00:04:51.32 --> 00:04:54.04
And then you orient yourself inside this new picture,

96
00:04:54.04 --> 00:04:55.80
and then you decide what you should do now, and then you

97
00:04:55.80 --> 00:04:58.48
act again, and you just keep running this loop.

98
00:04:58.48 --> 00:05:02.96
And every time you take an action,

99
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:06.04
it's going to change the situation a little bit.

100
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:08.28
And then you have to observe that feedback,

101
00:05:08.28 --> 00:05:10.52
orient yourself with that new feedback,

102
00:05:10.52 --> 00:05:12.16
and then you make another decision.

103
00:05:12.16 --> 00:05:15.56
And this becomes a little loop that you run over and over

104
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:21.64
again, and it comes from flying jets in combat and dogfights.

105
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:22.68
And it's a way that you win.

106
00:05:22.68 --> 00:05:28.20
And the way that you win is by making decisions and observing

107
00:05:28.20 --> 00:05:30.20
and orient yourself, deciding what you can do,

108
00:05:30.20 --> 00:05:32.20
and acting faster than the other person can do it.

109
00:05:32.20 --> 00:05:33.56
And if you can do that, you'll win.

110
00:05:33.56 --> 00:05:37.96
And this also applies in Jiu-Jitsu, obviously.

111
00:05:37.96 --> 00:05:42.16
So that's a loop that you need to run when

112
00:05:42.16 --> 00:05:43.32
it comes to making decisions.

113
00:05:43.32 --> 00:05:50.12
And this is a similar process to apply in this leadership

114
00:05:50.12 --> 00:05:56.000
decision loop that I think through when

115
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.12
I'm trying to make a decision.

116
00:05:58.12 --> 00:06:00.84
And again, a lot of times it seems like it's just

117
00:06:00.84 --> 00:06:02.52
some instinct.

118
00:06:02.52 --> 00:06:04.96
But there's a thought process behind it.

119
00:06:04.96 --> 00:06:09.76
And listen, the Uda loop, for the most part, the Uda loop,

120
00:06:09.76 --> 00:06:14.32
I view it as more of a tactical decision

121
00:06:14.32 --> 00:06:22.24
in a physical realm against an enemy or a competitor.

122
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:27.92
It's sort of an interaction between you and someone else

123
00:06:27.92 --> 00:06:31.48
in a physical, usually in a physical domain,

124
00:06:31.48 --> 00:06:32.80
whether it's fighter, whether it's

125
00:06:32.80 --> 00:06:34.20
tactical maneuver on the battlefield.

126
00:06:34.20 --> 00:06:37.36
That's why it's so applicable to combat.

127
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:40.72
Because in combat, you're going against another person.

128
00:06:40.72 --> 00:06:45.000
So as you decide and act, that's going to cause a reaction

129
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.40
that you have to then calculate into your new observations,

130
00:06:49.40 --> 00:06:51.04
into your new orientation.

131
00:06:51.04 --> 00:06:54.64
And so the Uda loop really is about,

132
00:06:54.64 --> 00:06:59.72
it takes place in the physical realm, for the most part.

133
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:03.12
This loop that I'm talking about, this EO, this extreme

134
00:07:03.12 --> 00:07:07.08
ownership, leadership loop, it's usually,

135
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:09.44
I shouldn't say usually not about physical decisions,

136
00:07:09.44 --> 00:07:17.44
but it's equally applicable to conceptual ideas

137
00:07:17.44 --> 00:07:19.20
or conceptual plans.

138
00:07:19.20 --> 00:07:23.40
Or, and this is important, about human interaction

139
00:07:23.40 --> 00:07:26.000
that's not physical.

140
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.28
It's more the conflict of ideas.

141
00:07:30.28 --> 00:07:34.44
So one loop is, in my mind, more of something

142
00:07:34.44 --> 00:07:36.08
that takes place in the physical realm.

143
00:07:36.08 --> 00:07:39.60
This EO leadership loop takes place more

144
00:07:39.60 --> 00:07:41.12
in the conceptual realm.

145
00:07:41.12 --> 00:07:42.04
Does that make sense?

146
00:07:42.04 --> 00:07:42.80
Yeah, fully.

147
00:07:42.80 --> 00:07:46.64
Like in a social, verbal, all that.

148
00:07:46.64 --> 00:07:49.64
Right.

149
00:07:49.64 --> 00:07:55.84
And what this loop does is it provides a checklist

150
00:07:55.84 --> 00:07:59.08
or a framework of things to consider while making a decision.

151
00:07:59.08 --> 00:08:01.76
And listen, when you first hear this,

152
00:08:01.76 --> 00:08:04.60
there's a bunch of things to think about.

153
00:08:04.60 --> 00:08:07.80
And what's weird is I had been doing this for so long

154
00:08:07.80 --> 00:08:12.72
that it seemed to other people, and really to me, as instinct.

155
00:08:12.72 --> 00:08:14.48
And it wasn't until I said, wait a second,

156
00:08:14.48 --> 00:08:15.68
is this really instinct, or is this

157
00:08:15.68 --> 00:08:16.28
something I learned?

158
00:08:16.28 --> 00:08:17.68
Well, I know I used to not have it.

159
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:18.88
Therefore, it can't be instinct.

160
00:08:18.88 --> 00:08:19.60
I must have learned it.

161
00:08:19.60 --> 00:08:20.92
What exactly am I thinking?

162
00:08:20.92 --> 00:08:23.44
What am I considering when I'm out there trying

163
00:08:23.44 --> 00:08:27.12
to make a decision in a leadership situation?

164
00:08:27.12 --> 00:08:29.60
So let's talk through some of these things.

165
00:08:29.60 --> 00:08:32.92
And there's a whole bunch of dynamics going on here.

166
00:08:32.92 --> 00:08:36.52
And I don't want to simplify this to a point where you go, oh,

167
00:08:36.52 --> 00:08:37.72
this is just a checklist.

168
00:08:37.72 --> 00:08:40.56
Here's the 19 or 14 or whatever number of things.

169
00:08:40.56 --> 00:08:42.12
And you just follow this checklist,

170
00:08:42.12 --> 00:08:47.60
because each one of these things is a conceptual item.

171
00:08:47.60 --> 00:08:49.96
There's a big difference between a conceptual idea

172
00:08:49.96 --> 00:08:51.48
and a physical thing.

173
00:08:51.48 --> 00:08:54.36
Because the physical thing is in this position.

174
00:08:54.36 --> 00:08:55.72
It has this mass.

175
00:08:55.72 --> 00:08:56.72
It has this weight.

176
00:08:56.72 --> 00:09:02.40
It takes up this place in the world.

177
00:09:02.40 --> 00:09:09.24
An idea, a concept, a plan, by its very nature is fluid.

178
00:09:09.24 --> 00:09:15.56
So all these things, for the most part, are somewhat fluid.

179
00:09:15.56 --> 00:09:17.12
Now, there's something about the first thing

180
00:09:17.12 --> 00:09:19.56
that I think about when I'm making some kind of a decision

181
00:09:19.56 --> 00:09:20.96
that's actually not fluid at all.

182
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:24.36
And that's why it's number one.

183
00:09:24.36 --> 00:09:26.32
And that is time.

184
00:09:26.32 --> 00:09:27.76
That's the number one thing I think about.

185
00:09:27.76 --> 00:09:29.72
The first thing that I consider when I'm making decision

186
00:09:29.72 --> 00:09:31.80
is time.

187
00:09:31.80 --> 00:09:33.92
And the reason is, because this is the one thing that's not

188
00:09:33.92 --> 00:09:36.76
fluid, it is what it is.

189
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.48
It is what it is.

190
00:09:37.48 --> 00:09:39.92
And you can't stop it.

191
00:09:39.92 --> 00:09:40.96
Can't stop it.

192
00:09:40.96 --> 00:09:42.56
You know what I'm talking to?

193
00:09:42.56 --> 00:09:43.32
Kerry Helton?

194
00:09:43.32 --> 00:09:43.96
Sure.

195
00:09:43.96 --> 00:09:44.36
You know him?

196
00:09:44.36 --> 00:09:44.84
K-Dog.

197
00:09:44.84 --> 00:09:45.44
K-Dog.

198
00:09:45.44 --> 00:09:46.68
That's right.

199
00:09:46.68 --> 00:09:48.76
He was talking about Marine Corps Boot Camp.

200
00:09:48.76 --> 00:09:52.92
And he had a good little hint for anybody that's

201
00:09:52.92 --> 00:09:54.80
going through something tough.

202
00:09:54.80 --> 00:09:56.68
And the thing that he thought about

203
00:09:56.68 --> 00:10:01.28
was these drill instructors, they

204
00:10:01.28 --> 00:10:03.92
might be all powerful in Marine Corps Boot Camp.

205
00:10:03.92 --> 00:10:07.72
They are all powerful, near-Godlike figures.

206
00:10:07.72 --> 00:10:08.76
But guess what?

207
00:10:08.76 --> 00:10:11.04
They can't stop the clock.

208
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:13.16
And no one can stop the clock.

209
00:10:13.16 --> 00:10:20.60
And I, you, us, we, we have no influence over time.

210
00:10:20.60 --> 00:10:23.72
We do have influence over actions clearly,

211
00:10:23.72 --> 00:10:25.20
but we don't have influence over time.

212
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:28.48
That clock is going to keep going.

213
00:10:28.48 --> 00:10:33.12
Look, you can, you can, you can get ahead of it

214
00:10:33.12 --> 00:10:35.04
by working hard, by thinking ahead.

215
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:38.60
And that's why it's the first thing that I think about.

216
00:10:38.60 --> 00:10:41.20
But you can't stop it, no matter what.

217
00:10:41.20 --> 00:10:44.08
That's why I can't stand being late.

218
00:10:44.08 --> 00:10:49.28
That's why when going to the airport,

219
00:10:49.28 --> 00:10:50.64
I'm going to show up early.

220
00:10:50.64 --> 00:10:53.60
I look not crazy early, but I'm going to show up early enough

221
00:10:53.60 --> 00:10:55.76
that nothing is going to make me panic.

222
00:10:55.76 --> 00:10:58.04
Nothing is going to make me agitated.

223
00:10:58.04 --> 00:10:59.64
The TSA dude's taking his time.

224
00:10:59.64 --> 00:11:01.84
Cool, I got time.

225
00:11:01.84 --> 00:11:04.20
And you ever notice when you're late for something,

226
00:11:04.20 --> 00:11:05.36
everything goes against you?

227
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:06.48
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:11:06.48 --> 00:11:06.88
Right?

229
00:11:06.88 --> 00:11:07.64
Feels like it.

230
00:11:07.64 --> 00:11:08.36
It's true.

231
00:11:08.36 --> 00:11:11.76
If you're, if you're on time, green lights.

232
00:11:11.76 --> 00:11:12.24
Yeah.

233
00:11:12.24 --> 00:11:13.88
If you're late, red lights.

234
00:11:13.88 --> 00:11:14.56
Red lights all day.

235
00:11:14.56 --> 00:11:17.48
Not only that, but weird red lights.

236
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:17.92
Right?

237
00:11:17.92 --> 00:11:19.24
Anomalous red lights.

238
00:11:19.24 --> 00:11:21.24
How long is a red light when you're late?

239
00:11:21.24 --> 00:11:22.16
That thing is forever.

240
00:11:22.16 --> 00:11:23.04
Yeah, it's true.

241
00:11:23.04 --> 00:11:25.000
But the weird thing is, it's the same.

242
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.88
It's just that you're different.

243
00:11:26.88 --> 00:11:30.32
Your mentality is different.

244
00:11:30.32 --> 00:11:32.32
I tell you that story about the other day,

245
00:11:32.32 --> 00:11:34.88
speaking of like mentality.

246
00:11:34.88 --> 00:11:37.44
So I was at REI.

247
00:11:37.44 --> 00:11:38.28
You from the other REI?

248
00:11:38.28 --> 00:11:38.92
The store?

249
00:11:38.92 --> 00:11:39.28
Yeah.

250
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:40.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sports store.

251
00:11:40.36 --> 00:11:41.08
It's good.

252
00:11:41.08 --> 00:11:42.60
So I'm in REI.

253
00:11:42.60 --> 00:11:44.72
And I got a sprinter.

254
00:11:44.72 --> 00:11:45.12
Sure.

255
00:11:45.12 --> 00:11:45.76
Vehicle.

256
00:11:45.76 --> 00:11:46.76
It's a good vehicle for sure.

257
00:11:46.76 --> 00:11:48.000
Four-wheel drive sprinter.

258
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.80
No big deal.

259
00:11:48.80 --> 00:11:49.92
And I get it.

260
00:11:49.92 --> 00:11:52.64
OK, so do you know that sprinters are a thing?

261
00:11:52.64 --> 00:11:53.16
Do you know that?

262
00:11:53.16 --> 00:11:54.000
I know that now, yes.

263
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.40
Yeah.

264
00:11:54.40 --> 00:11:55.20
They're a thing.

265
00:11:55.20 --> 00:11:57.52
My wife told me that when she saw yours.

266
00:11:57.52 --> 00:11:57.88
Yep.

267
00:11:57.88 --> 00:12:01.72
And not only are they a thing, there's

268
00:12:01.72 --> 00:12:05.88
also a big negative perception of them,

269
00:12:05.88 --> 00:12:11.16
because they're expensive and people drive them around.

270
00:12:11.16 --> 00:12:16.72
And they're into people that might have sprinters,

271
00:12:16.72 --> 00:12:22.40
might be into sort of outdoors type sports

272
00:12:22.40 --> 00:12:25.52
and a lot of times people that are in outdoors type sports

273
00:12:25.52 --> 00:12:27.000
don't have a ton of money.

274
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.60
Oh, got you.

275
00:12:27.60 --> 00:12:29.96
So hey, look at rock climbing.

276
00:12:29.96 --> 00:12:30.44
Right?

277
00:12:30.44 --> 00:12:32.60
Rock climbing, camp for Yosemite.

278
00:12:32.60 --> 00:12:35.80
Their actual name for themselves is dirtbags.

279
00:12:35.80 --> 00:12:37.24
Hey, we don't have money.

280
00:12:37.24 --> 00:12:39.92
We live in a little freaking Toyota Corolla.

281
00:12:39.92 --> 00:12:41.20
We sleep in a tent.

282
00:12:41.20 --> 00:12:42.60
Like, that's what they're doing.

283
00:12:42.60 --> 00:12:43.88
So you get those kind of people.

284
00:12:43.88 --> 00:12:45.48
You get surf bums.

285
00:12:45.48 --> 00:12:45.96
Right?

286
00:12:45.96 --> 00:12:49.64
You and I have talked about the fact that bums is a lifestyle

287
00:12:49.64 --> 00:12:50.24
and there's a bunch of them.

288
00:12:50.24 --> 00:12:54.52
Surf bums, jujitsu bums, rock climbing bums, ski bums.

289
00:12:54.52 --> 00:12:56.08
So there's a bunch of bums, right?

290
00:12:56.08 --> 00:12:58.000
Well, all of those lifestyles can also

291
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.96
include people that might drive sprinters.

292
00:13:00.96 --> 00:13:02.96
The bougie of the group.

293
00:13:02.96 --> 00:13:04.88
The bougie people, right?

294
00:13:04.88 --> 00:13:08.64
So I'm a bougie person, I guess, because I got a sprinter.

295
00:13:08.64 --> 00:13:09.16
And guess what?

296
00:13:09.16 --> 00:13:10.000
I like to surf.

297
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.04
I like to ski.

298
00:13:11.04 --> 00:13:12.76
I go to Yosemite, right?

299
00:13:12.76 --> 00:13:15.88
So I do those things.

300
00:13:15.88 --> 00:13:18.92
So I'm at Ariai to pick up a bicycle.

301
00:13:18.92 --> 00:13:19.48
Sure.

302
00:13:19.48 --> 00:13:23.08
And as I'm pulling out, I'm leaving.

303
00:13:23.08 --> 00:13:25.88
And by the way, I'm in no rush whatsoever.

304
00:13:25.88 --> 00:13:27.000
Time is on my side.

305
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.48
I'm listening to an audiobook.

306
00:13:30.48 --> 00:13:31.72
I'm totally chill.

307
00:13:31.72 --> 00:13:33.04
I don't have to be.

308
00:13:33.04 --> 00:13:36.24
I think we weren't recording that day.

309
00:13:36.24 --> 00:13:38.68
I had done like a couple calls in the morning for echelon

310
00:13:38.68 --> 00:13:39.68
front.

311
00:13:39.68 --> 00:13:41.04
I was in no rush.

312
00:13:41.04 --> 00:13:42.72
Just kind of enjoying.

313
00:13:42.72 --> 00:13:43.88
Like, I was working in the morning.

314
00:13:43.88 --> 00:13:47.24
And it was like a nice little mini vacation, to be honest.

315
00:13:47.24 --> 00:13:47.96
We drive to Ariai.

316
00:13:47.96 --> 00:13:49.72
You know, go to Ariai, you get up there,

317
00:13:49.72 --> 00:13:51.64
you get to look around, see some cool gear.

318
00:13:51.64 --> 00:13:52.88
It's nice, yeah.

319
00:13:52.88 --> 00:13:55.16
So that's my mindset.

320
00:13:55.16 --> 00:13:55.88
Just cruising to any.

321
00:13:55.88 --> 00:13:57.28
By the way, it's midday.

322
00:13:57.28 --> 00:13:58.52
This isn't a weekend.

323
00:13:58.52 --> 00:14:00.56
This is like on a Tuesday or something.

324
00:14:00.56 --> 00:14:02.48
There's no panic at all.

325
00:14:02.48 --> 00:14:03.36
No one's even in there.

326
00:14:03.36 --> 00:14:07.64
It's like after, I'll tell you how clear this was,

327
00:14:07.64 --> 00:14:11.52
it's after the lunchtime rush on Tuesday.

328
00:14:11.52 --> 00:14:12.92
Complete chill.

329
00:14:12.92 --> 00:14:16.76
So as I'm pulling out, I won't try and explain the whole thing,

330
00:14:16.76 --> 00:14:20.16
but there's like a three-way intersection in the parking

331
00:14:20.16 --> 00:14:22.08
lot.

332
00:14:22.08 --> 00:14:25.32
And so I back out my sprinter.

333
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:28.76
And there's another truck that I'm now head to head with.

334
00:14:28.76 --> 00:14:30.52
He wants to go right to get out.

335
00:14:30.52 --> 00:14:32.92
I want to go left to get out.

336
00:14:32.92 --> 00:14:40.36
And in comes a little Volkswagen van again, Syncro.

337
00:14:40.36 --> 00:14:47.08
So what this is, this is a four-wheel drive Volkswagen van.

338
00:14:47.08 --> 00:14:50.08
Very rare, very cool.

339
00:14:50.08 --> 00:14:51.88
Like one of the coolest, it's a very,

340
00:14:51.88 --> 00:14:53.96
I won't say it's one of the coolest vehicles in the world,

341
00:14:53.96 --> 00:14:56.52
but it's definitely in my top.

342
00:14:56.52 --> 00:14:57.48
That's a cool vehicle.

343
00:14:57.48 --> 00:14:58.52
They're super rare.

344
00:14:58.52 --> 00:15:03.04
So Syncro, that's a four-wheel drive van.

345
00:15:03.04 --> 00:15:04.60
Oh yeah, for a little Volkswagen van.

346
00:15:04.60 --> 00:15:05.80
Yeah, I love vans.

347
00:15:05.80 --> 00:15:07.72
So which is why I have a sprinter.

348
00:15:07.72 --> 00:15:08.60
Yes, sir.

349
00:15:08.60 --> 00:15:12.28
So I see this van and I'm kind of like, oh, dude, that's a sick.

350
00:15:12.28 --> 00:15:14.88
Four-wheel drive Syncro van.

351
00:15:14.88 --> 00:15:15.92
It's super rare.

352
00:15:15.92 --> 00:15:18.12
They're hard to get.

353
00:15:18.12 --> 00:15:22.08
And the truck wants to go right.

354
00:15:22.08 --> 00:15:23.08
He goes right.

355
00:15:23.08 --> 00:15:24.04
I'm like, cool.

356
00:15:24.04 --> 00:15:25.64
That guy's being cool.

357
00:15:25.64 --> 00:15:27.80
Or I give him the little hand wave.

358
00:15:27.80 --> 00:15:29.36
He goes, because I'm super chill.

359
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:31.44
By the way, I'm looking at this cool Syncro.

360
00:15:31.44 --> 00:15:33.20
So I give the guy a hand wave and the truck, I'm like, hey, man,

361
00:15:33.20 --> 00:15:33.68
go ahead.

362
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:35.08
So he pulls out.

363
00:15:35.08 --> 00:15:39.88
And then I think that the Syncro wants to make a right.

364
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:41.000
So I look at him.

365
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.12
I give him the hand wave.

366
00:15:42.12 --> 00:15:44.64
Just like, hey, man, come on.

367
00:15:44.64 --> 00:15:47.08
And I was, you know, the next hand signal

368
00:15:47.08 --> 00:15:48.20
would have been thumbs up.

369
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:51.96
I might have even, I may have even rolled down the window

370
00:15:51.96 --> 00:15:54.80
and said, sweet ride.

371
00:15:54.80 --> 00:15:56.20
That's a sweet ride, man.

372
00:15:56.20 --> 00:15:59.40
Respect, props.

373
00:15:59.40 --> 00:16:00.52
I give him the hand signal.

374
00:16:00.52 --> 00:16:01.84
Like, yeah, go ahead, man.

375
00:16:01.84 --> 00:16:04.84
You can make the right turn and then I'll get out after you.

376
00:16:04.84 --> 00:16:07.36
You get ahead of the line privileges.

377
00:16:07.36 --> 00:16:09.44
You go first.

378
00:16:09.44 --> 00:16:10.68
And guess what he does?

379
00:16:10.68 --> 00:16:12.40
He starts freaking, you know, of course,

380
00:16:12.40 --> 00:16:13.40
behind a windscreen.

381
00:16:13.40 --> 00:16:14.88
I can't hear what he's saying.

382
00:16:14.88 --> 00:16:17.12
He starts going crazy on me.

383
00:16:17.12 --> 00:16:19.24
Like, he's yelling.

384
00:16:19.24 --> 00:16:23.32
And what he was basically saying was he wanted me to move,

385
00:16:23.32 --> 00:16:25.52
because the parking space I had just pulled out of,

386
00:16:25.52 --> 00:16:26.24
he had pulled into.

387
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:29.28
And by the way, there was multiple parking spaces.

388
00:16:29.28 --> 00:16:30.72
There was no factor.

389
00:16:30.72 --> 00:16:32.56
But man, he was mad.

390
00:16:32.56 --> 00:16:35.20
And he was like getting all hostile and like doing this

391
00:16:35.20 --> 00:16:35.44
to me.

392
00:16:35.44 --> 00:16:36.80
And I was just like, and of course, what I did,

393
00:16:36.80 --> 00:16:38.96
smiled at him and waved at him anyways.

394
00:16:38.96 --> 00:16:40.44
I didn't give him props for his synchro.

395
00:16:40.44 --> 00:16:42.68
So if you're listening, nice synchro, bro.

396
00:16:42.68 --> 00:16:45.20
And I hope your synchro and the fact

397
00:16:45.20 --> 00:16:46.60
that you have a cool vehicle like that,

398
00:16:46.60 --> 00:16:49.40
I hope that it soothes your soul a little bit.

399
00:16:49.40 --> 00:16:52.08
Because he is an older dude, too.

400
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:54.32
He was at least my age.

401
00:16:54.32 --> 00:16:55.68
He wasn't a spring chicken.

402
00:16:55.68 --> 00:16:58.64
And there's no reason for him to be stressed out on a Tuesday

403
00:16:58.64 --> 00:17:01.56
at 1,300 or 1,330 in the afternoon at REI.

404
00:17:01.56 --> 00:17:02.92
No reason, man.

405
00:17:02.92 --> 00:17:04.36
No reason.

406
00:17:04.36 --> 00:17:08.000
So in his mind, whatever was happening for the time factor

407
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.64
was a problem.

408
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:10.76
For me, it was no factor.

409
00:17:10.76 --> 00:17:12.40
But you can't get that stuff back.

410
00:17:12.40 --> 00:17:14.28
You can't adjust time.

411
00:17:14.28 --> 00:17:17.32
So we have to stay ahead of time.

412
00:17:17.32 --> 00:17:20.12
So when I'm making a decision, the first thing

413
00:17:20.12 --> 00:17:23.92
that I'm going to assess is how much time do I have?

414
00:17:23.92 --> 00:17:25.04
Here's another thing.

415
00:17:25.04 --> 00:17:28.32
How fast are things changing?

416
00:17:28.32 --> 00:17:29.96
That's a time factor.

417
00:17:29.96 --> 00:17:31.40
You have to look at, OK, I see things

418
00:17:31.40 --> 00:17:32.84
are changing, but how fast are they changing?

419
00:17:32.84 --> 00:17:34.76
Because if they're changing rapidly,

420
00:17:34.76 --> 00:17:36.20
I might have to decide quicker.

421
00:17:36.20 --> 00:17:38.96
If they're changing slowly, maybe I

422
00:17:38.96 --> 00:17:41.12
can take a little bit more time.

423
00:17:41.12 --> 00:17:45.44
Are there things that I can do to buy myself more time?

424
00:17:45.44 --> 00:17:47.28
I know I said we can't control time,

425
00:17:47.28 --> 00:17:51.84
but you can't do things that can earn you some time back.

426
00:17:51.84 --> 00:17:53.76
Maybe there's an iterative step that I

427
00:17:53.76 --> 00:17:57.92
can take that will slow things down a little bit on my side.

428
00:17:57.92 --> 00:18:01.20
Again, I can't stop the clock, but I can slow them down.

429
00:18:01.20 --> 00:18:04.48
So that's what I'm going to do.

430
00:18:04.48 --> 00:18:06.48
I don't have any control over time,

431
00:18:06.48 --> 00:18:08.52
and I'm going to think about that.

432
00:18:08.52 --> 00:18:10.24
I'm going to consider it.

433
00:18:10.24 --> 00:18:13.48
The number one element in my calculus is time.

434
00:18:13.48 --> 00:18:18.28
And here's something else that I realize.

435
00:18:18.28 --> 00:18:21.80
Some human beings have a better sense of time than others.

436
00:18:21.80 --> 00:18:23.80
This is just a thing.

437
00:18:23.80 --> 00:18:28.32
Some human beings are more aware of time than others.

438
00:18:28.32 --> 00:18:30.72
There are people that are late habitually.

439
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:31.44
Right?

440
00:18:31.44 --> 00:18:32.36
Do we know this?

441
00:18:32.36 --> 00:18:32.80
We do know.

442
00:18:32.80 --> 00:18:34.20
Actually, somebody at the council asked me,

443
00:18:34.20 --> 00:18:36.04
hey, how do you do with echo being late all the time?

444
00:18:36.04 --> 00:18:38.44
And I had to give them the information that you're actually

445
00:18:38.44 --> 00:18:39.20
not.

446
00:18:39.20 --> 00:18:43.08
I think you've only been literally late once or twice

447
00:18:43.08 --> 00:18:45.60
for recording the podcast.

448
00:18:45.60 --> 00:18:47.04
Yeah, it's once or twice.

449
00:18:47.04 --> 00:18:52.24
Now, do you cut it down to literally 32 seconds?

450
00:18:52.24 --> 00:18:55.000
And actually, if we included when you are maybe like 45

451
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.68
seconds late, we might have to add to that number.

452
00:18:57.68 --> 00:18:59.68
But there's no time.

453
00:18:59.68 --> 00:19:02.44
There's a very small number of actual violations.

454
00:19:02.44 --> 00:19:03.56
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

455
00:19:03.56 --> 00:19:04.96
I think so.

456
00:19:04.96 --> 00:19:08.44
But there are some people that are late all the time.

457
00:19:08.44 --> 00:19:11.04
There are people that think that things are going to take

458
00:19:11.04 --> 00:19:15.40
five minutes, and they take 20, and that's how they see time.

459
00:19:15.40 --> 00:19:17.16
And so they're late all the time.

460
00:19:17.16 --> 00:19:18.56
So if you're one of those people,

461
00:19:18.56 --> 00:19:20.08
and this is going to be a constant theme,

462
00:19:20.08 --> 00:19:23.68
if you're one of those people and you know that you don't

463
00:19:23.68 --> 00:19:27.44
understand time and you don't pay attention to time,

464
00:19:27.44 --> 00:19:29.08
the worst you are with time, if you're

465
00:19:29.08 --> 00:19:32.92
a person that's habitually late, this should not only be the

466
00:19:32.92 --> 00:19:34.80
number one thing in your decision making,

467
00:19:34.80 --> 00:19:38.40
it should be number one, and it should be printed in bold,

468
00:19:38.40 --> 00:19:43.44
large font so that you make sure that you get it.

469
00:19:43.44 --> 00:19:47.28
Now, listen, I'm actually good with time.

470
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:49.40
In fact, sometimes I'm even too good with time,

471
00:19:49.40 --> 00:19:51.76
and I'll tell you exactly what I mean by that.

472
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:56.48
Sometimes, if I think, let's say,

473
00:19:56.48 --> 00:19:59.80
we were going to record the podcast at 10 o'clock,

474
00:19:59.80 --> 00:20:04.64
and I was like, OK, in order to record the podcast at 10 o'clock,

475
00:20:04.64 --> 00:20:06.12
I got to leave at 9.30.

476
00:20:06.12 --> 00:20:07.84
That gives me a half an hour to get here.

477
00:20:07.84 --> 00:20:09.84
It only takes 15 minutes to get here.

478
00:20:09.84 --> 00:20:14.52
Tops, unless something wild happens,

479
00:20:14.52 --> 00:20:17.24
or I hit every single red light or something.

480
00:20:17.24 --> 00:20:21.48
So I might be like, oh, I need to take out the garbage right now.

481
00:20:21.48 --> 00:20:24.56
But that's going to take me an extra two minutes,

482
00:20:24.56 --> 00:20:30.000
and there's a 0.0001% chance that I hit every red light.

483
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.92
And now that two minutes that it took me to take out the garbage,

484
00:20:33.92 --> 00:20:34.76
now I'm late.

485
00:20:34.76 --> 00:20:36.60
So I didn't take out the garbage.

486
00:20:36.60 --> 00:20:40.000
So sometimes I have to consciously say, yes, I can fit this in.

487
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.64
Yes, I can get that done.

488
00:20:41.64 --> 00:20:43.68
And that is a good thing to do.

489
00:20:43.68 --> 00:20:49.20
But I'm almost never late.

490
00:20:49.20 --> 00:20:51.44
I would say never, but of course, I'm sure there's

491
00:20:51.44 --> 00:20:54.20
been some time in the last 50 years where I was late

492
00:20:54.20 --> 00:20:57.76
for something, but I'm almost never late.

493
00:20:57.76 --> 00:21:01.60
And probably, and what I think is,

494
00:21:01.60 --> 00:21:04.72
that's because of this loop that I run in my head.

495
00:21:04.72 --> 00:21:06.76
I always think about time first.

496
00:21:06.76 --> 00:21:07.52
And that.

497
00:21:07.52 --> 00:21:08.92
So the reason I'm never late is because I

498
00:21:08.92 --> 00:21:11.40
think about this all the time.

499
00:21:11.40 --> 00:21:13.96
So know yourself.

500
00:21:13.96 --> 00:21:15.52
And if you're a person that constantly

501
00:21:15.52 --> 00:21:18.84
underestimates how much time it'll take to do something,

502
00:21:18.84 --> 00:21:20.12
know yourself.

503
00:21:20.12 --> 00:21:21.52
Understand your own bias.

504
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:22.68
And this is actually one of the things

505
00:21:22.68 --> 00:21:24.40
that the loop is understanding your own biases.

506
00:21:24.40 --> 00:21:26.20
This is where you've got to run that and make sure

507
00:21:26.20 --> 00:21:29.92
that you're going to have enough time to do something.

508
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:30.56
Check.

509
00:21:30.56 --> 00:21:31.32
Yeah, fully.

510
00:21:31.32 --> 00:21:36.60
And regardless of my record of not being late very much,

511
00:21:36.60 --> 00:21:40.96
here I am one of those people that underestimate.

512
00:21:40.96 --> 00:21:41.68
How did you put it?

513
00:21:41.68 --> 00:21:43.08
Underestimate how much time I have?

514
00:21:43.08 --> 00:21:43.76
How much time?

515
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:44.60
Overestimate.

516
00:21:44.60 --> 00:21:46.76
Overestimate how much time you have.

517
00:21:46.76 --> 00:21:48.72
Underestimate how much time something is going to take.

518
00:21:48.72 --> 00:21:49.56
Yes.

519
00:21:49.56 --> 00:21:52.32
Interestingly, if we were to talk about how often

520
00:21:52.32 --> 00:21:54.84
you were late for jujitsu, that's a big number.

521
00:21:54.84 --> 00:21:55.40
Yeah.

522
00:21:55.40 --> 00:21:56.20
That's a big number.

523
00:21:56.20 --> 00:21:58.20
The majority, yeah.

524
00:21:58.20 --> 00:21:59.48
It was weird.

525
00:21:59.48 --> 00:22:02.20
Actually, in the beginning, when I was coming up,

526
00:22:02.20 --> 00:22:02.80
I was never late.

527
00:22:02.80 --> 00:22:07.40
But I think you're the one who said this to me kind of bluntly

528
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:10.36
a long time ago, where you said something like,

529
00:22:10.36 --> 00:22:12.56
oh, it's because you don't think it's important or something

530
00:22:12.56 --> 00:22:13.32
like this.

531
00:22:13.32 --> 00:22:17.36
But I realized it's true, even though most of the time I

532
00:22:17.36 --> 00:22:20.32
wouldn't admit that to the person that I'm late with

533
00:22:20.32 --> 00:22:22.44
or whatever the entity or whatever.

534
00:22:22.44 --> 00:22:25.04
When I worked in the nightclub, I was late most of the time.

535
00:22:25.04 --> 00:22:29.80
And I'm not saying like, I was supposed to be there at 6

536
00:22:29.80 --> 00:22:31.12
and I was there at like 6.30.

537
00:22:31.12 --> 00:22:31.72
It wasn't that.

538
00:22:31.72 --> 00:22:33.96
It was the kind of 6.01, 6.03.

539
00:22:33.96 --> 00:22:35.20
How about 6.08?

540
00:22:35.20 --> 00:22:36.76
6.08 from the time.

541
00:22:36.76 --> 00:22:39.44
As you get up past five minutes late, it was less.

542
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:44.44
But it not being important, that was literally the case.

543
00:22:44.44 --> 00:22:46.20
And not to say my job wasn't important,

544
00:22:46.20 --> 00:22:47.44
I'm not saying that.

545
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:50.04
I'm saying the fact of me being ahead of time

546
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:53.36
or before 6 o'clock, that wasn't important to me.

547
00:22:53.36 --> 00:22:55.48
If I was one, two, three, four, five minutes late,

548
00:22:55.48 --> 00:22:59.92
that was fine with me for this reason now that I analyze it.

549
00:22:59.92 --> 00:23:03.40
Because I could be doing more important things

550
00:23:03.40 --> 00:23:07.20
than in that five minutes, or in that one minute,

551
00:23:07.20 --> 00:23:08.32
or in that two minutes.

552
00:23:08.32 --> 00:23:10.52
Kind of a thing, kind of a thought ahead of my head.

553
00:23:10.52 --> 00:23:16.52
And now, more important things, taking a nap,

554
00:23:16.52 --> 00:23:21.96
you know, and watching stuff that, the way I saw it was,

555
00:23:21.96 --> 00:23:25.36
and this is me totally analyzing it mentally.

556
00:23:25.36 --> 00:23:26.80
This wasn't in my mind the whole time.

557
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:30.44
Like, oh yeah, this TV show is way more important than me.

558
00:23:30.44 --> 00:23:31.36
It wasn't like that.

559
00:23:31.36 --> 00:23:35.04
It was just as it turns out that, like, dang,

560
00:23:35.04 --> 00:23:39.56
why would I essentially go to where

561
00:23:39.56 --> 00:23:43.92
I have to be kind of a thing when I want to do this?

562
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:44.96
And I don't have to be there.

563
00:23:44.96 --> 00:23:48.76
I don't have to be there at 6.59 or 5.59.

564
00:23:48.76 --> 00:23:52.08
One of my seal buddies, when I was going to college,

565
00:23:52.08 --> 00:23:56.48
there was another seal that was going to college as well.

566
00:23:56.48 --> 00:23:59.16
And we actually made a deal.

567
00:23:59.16 --> 00:24:03.12
Because in order to be on time for something,

568
00:24:03.12 --> 00:24:05.08
because of parking at this particular college,

569
00:24:05.08 --> 00:24:08.04
and eventually I figured out that I would just throw my bike

570
00:24:08.04 --> 00:24:11.84
in the back of my van and just whip the bike out

571
00:24:11.84 --> 00:24:12.64
and bike to the class.

572
00:24:12.64 --> 00:24:16.16
Park away away from campus and just jump on my bike

573
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:18.16
and drive or ride the bike.

574
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:21.68
But when we would be studying together,

575
00:24:21.68 --> 00:24:23.76
and we'd be like, hey, we'll study it.

576
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:26.28
I'll meet you at 9 o'clock to study.

577
00:24:26.28 --> 00:24:27.28
We did this a few times.

578
00:24:27.28 --> 00:24:30.04
And then eventually, and he was like a guy like me married

579
00:24:30.04 --> 00:24:30.76
with kids.

580
00:24:30.76 --> 00:24:35.36
So we didn't want to, if we didn't have to be at campus,

581
00:24:35.36 --> 00:24:36.36
we didn't want to be there.

582
00:24:36.36 --> 00:24:39.000
Not to mention Jiu Jitsu, not to mention surfing.

583
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.64
So there's a bunch of other things we'd all rather be doing.

584
00:24:41.64 --> 00:24:42.84
So we made a deal.

585
00:24:42.84 --> 00:24:47.16
I was like, hey, I'll see you around 9.

586
00:24:47.16 --> 00:24:50.52
And he was like, yeah, because that way, if you rolled up

587
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:53.12
and you took you an extra four minutes to find parking,

588
00:24:53.12 --> 00:24:54.60
you weren't like, dude.

589
00:24:54.60 --> 00:24:56.76
Because the only way to ensure you weren't going

590
00:24:56.76 --> 00:25:00.04
to be four minutes late was to be a half an hour early.

591
00:25:00.04 --> 00:25:01.32
You see what I'm saying?

592
00:25:01.32 --> 00:25:06.32
The only way to, it cost you 26 minutes of life

593
00:25:06.32 --> 00:25:08.28
in order to ensure that you weren't going

594
00:25:08.28 --> 00:25:09.28
to be four minutes late.

595
00:25:09.28 --> 00:25:12.40
And so we were like, hey, listen, around 9.

596
00:25:12.40 --> 00:25:14.56
And we actually had the conversation,

597
00:25:14.56 --> 00:25:17.60
because both of us squared away like, hey, being late

598
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:18.72
is the worst thing in the world.

599
00:25:18.72 --> 00:25:21.92
And we made an agreement, a gentleman's agreement,

600
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:26.92
that in this particular scenario, you had slack.

601
00:25:26.92 --> 00:25:27.72
You had slack.

602
00:25:27.72 --> 00:25:28.32
Yes, I'm great.

603
00:25:28.32 --> 00:25:29.56
And when you got there, you got there.

604
00:25:29.56 --> 00:25:31.32
It wasn't going to be 20 minutes late.

605
00:25:31.32 --> 00:25:32.36
But it was going to be four minutes.

606
00:25:32.36 --> 00:25:33.44
It might be six minutes.

607
00:25:33.44 --> 00:25:34.72
It might be three minutes.

608
00:25:34.72 --> 00:25:36.84
So we had that little gentleman's agreement.

609
00:25:36.84 --> 00:25:39.40
So the target is nine.

610
00:25:39.40 --> 00:25:40.36
Target is nine.

611
00:25:40.36 --> 00:25:42.16
And I'll be there.

612
00:25:42.16 --> 00:25:44.52
And if you're not there, I know 100% why.

613
00:25:44.52 --> 00:25:48.20
It's because you weren't going to leave 26 minutes earlier

614
00:25:48.20 --> 00:25:49.28
to be there on time.

615
00:25:49.28 --> 00:25:50.84
Because it didn't make sense, because I'd rather

616
00:25:50.84 --> 00:25:52.92
he was with his kids, or he was surfing,

617
00:25:52.92 --> 00:25:53.84
or he was doing jujitsu.

618
00:25:53.84 --> 00:25:55.48
Actually, he did jujitsu.

619
00:25:55.48 --> 00:25:57.88
I knew he was doing something that was more important

620
00:25:57.88 --> 00:25:59.76
than sitting and waiting for me to show up

621
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:01.64
to prove that we could both be on time.

622
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:02.12
Yeah.

623
00:26:02.12 --> 00:26:04.36
So that's interesting how you say it.

624
00:26:04.36 --> 00:26:07.08
Or that's an interesting concept, because that's essentially

625
00:26:07.08 --> 00:26:10.12
the agreement I made with my work.

626
00:26:10.12 --> 00:26:11.36
They didn't make that agreement.

627
00:26:11.36 --> 00:26:14.28
But I did, too, where it's like, hey, I'm not going to give up.

628
00:26:14.28 --> 00:26:15.96
Because it was the same kind of scenario, where

629
00:26:15.96 --> 00:26:17.12
you have to look for parking.

630
00:26:17.12 --> 00:26:18.72
Sure, you could pay for parking, but not what.

631
00:26:18.72 --> 00:26:20.92
I got to pay extra to be at work kind of a thing.

632
00:26:20.92 --> 00:26:22.64
And I'm not saying that's good, but I'm not

633
00:26:22.64 --> 00:26:24.72
saying that that should be the case or shouldn't be the case.

634
00:26:24.72 --> 00:26:26.40
I'm just saying that's what I thought at the time.

635
00:26:26.40 --> 00:26:27.84
That was the agreement in Echo's head.

636
00:26:27.84 --> 00:26:29.52
Yes, exactly.

637
00:26:29.52 --> 00:26:33.12
So downtown San Diego, 6 o'clock PM,

638
00:26:33.12 --> 00:26:36.12
especially on those Thursday, Friday, Saturday scenarios,

639
00:26:36.12 --> 00:26:37.44
that's hard to find parking.

640
00:26:37.44 --> 00:26:39.60
Or it can be, anyway.

641
00:26:39.60 --> 00:26:43.32
So yeah, so I'd be like, OK, I'm going to go out to my opportune

642
00:26:43.32 --> 00:26:45.52
time, my best time in my mind.

643
00:26:45.52 --> 00:26:48.04
And hey, if I'm struggling finding parking,

644
00:26:48.04 --> 00:26:49.84
I'm struggling finding parking.

645
00:26:49.84 --> 00:26:51.20
In your mind, it was no factor.

646
00:26:51.20 --> 00:26:52.40
The gentleman's agreement.

647
00:26:52.40 --> 00:26:55.000
Because you would have had to leave legitimately, probably

648
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.96
a half an hour early, to ensure 100% that you were going to be

649
00:26:57.96 --> 00:26:58.48
on time.

650
00:26:58.48 --> 00:27:00.48
Yeah, probably a little bit more exactly right.

651
00:27:00.48 --> 00:27:04.52
To ensure, like, the kind, no, you got to be here before 6

652
00:27:04.52 --> 00:27:06.44
or whatever kind of a thing, to ensure, yeah, it's like half

653
00:27:06.44 --> 00:27:06.92
an hour.

654
00:27:06.92 --> 00:27:09.20
It's like, bro, it's not even, in my mind, it's not even fair.

655
00:27:09.20 --> 00:27:09.80
How about this?

656
00:27:09.80 --> 00:27:11.80
How about this?

657
00:27:11.80 --> 00:27:15.84
Well, we'll decide a reasonable amount of time

658
00:27:15.84 --> 00:27:16.92
I have to leave the house.

659
00:27:16.92 --> 00:27:17.80
How about that?

660
00:27:17.80 --> 00:27:21.40
And if parking is abnormally scarce, or traffic,

661
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.80
we're going to pay that price together.

662
00:27:22.80 --> 00:27:23.76
How about that?

663
00:27:23.76 --> 00:27:28.08
The traffic thing is weird, too, because that's an excuse

664
00:27:28.08 --> 00:27:28.92
that people use.

665
00:27:28.92 --> 00:27:30.96
Like, oh, yeah, I really hit traffic.

666
00:27:30.96 --> 00:27:35.84
And if you live in California, you're like, bro,

667
00:27:35.84 --> 00:27:37.32
you got to calculate for that.

668
00:27:37.32 --> 00:27:37.96
Come on.

669
00:27:37.96 --> 00:27:39.96
Yeah, I agree.

670
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:43.92
It's kind of not a valid excuse, unless, let's say you

671
00:27:43.92 --> 00:27:46.76
and I work in an office every single day.

672
00:27:46.76 --> 00:27:49.48
And we make that agreement.

673
00:27:49.48 --> 00:27:52.52
Like, hey, our goal is 9 o'clock, but I understand.

674
00:27:52.52 --> 00:27:56.48
I don't want you to leave an hour early to make sure you

675
00:27:56.48 --> 00:27:58.32
get here at that time.

676
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:00.36
And I go, hey, man, you leave your house.

677
00:28:00.36 --> 00:28:02.60
Like you said, you leave your house before this time?

678
00:28:02.60 --> 00:28:03.48
Reasonable.

679
00:28:03.48 --> 00:28:06.88
I knew that there's going to be some variables.

680
00:28:06.88 --> 00:28:07.52
Yeah.

681
00:28:07.52 --> 00:28:10.84
And especially if they're like, the variables really vary.

682
00:28:10.84 --> 00:28:14.04
Because the traffic thing, I don't know about your routes

683
00:28:14.04 --> 00:28:16.36
in San Diego, whatever, but as far as the routine goes,

684
00:28:16.36 --> 00:28:19.04
very lucid routine that I have, it's

685
00:28:19.04 --> 00:28:20.88
I know when the traffic is going to be.

686
00:28:20.88 --> 00:28:22.72
It's pretty predictable.

687
00:28:22.72 --> 00:28:26.04
You got your anomalous accident or some hold up on the road

688
00:28:26.04 --> 00:28:28.52
every once in a great, great, great while.

689
00:28:28.52 --> 00:28:33.08
But so it is, to me anyway, I think

690
00:28:33.08 --> 00:28:35.44
that factoring the traffic is a fair thing.

691
00:28:35.44 --> 00:28:38.56
Like you got to, hey, if it takes 15 more minutes

692
00:28:38.56 --> 00:28:42.76
on this Tuesday after work versus Sunday morning

693
00:28:42.76 --> 00:28:45.000
or whatever, then that's part of the agreement.

694
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.56
You got to factor that in.

695
00:28:46.56 --> 00:28:47.76
Put that in calculus.

696
00:28:47.76 --> 00:28:51.52
But Sunday morning, let's say Sunday morning,

697
00:28:51.52 --> 00:28:54.08
every time we're recording and then or whatever we're doing

698
00:28:54.08 --> 00:28:56.76
and then no traffic.

699
00:28:56.76 --> 00:28:58.32
And then one day there's like traffic

700
00:28:58.32 --> 00:29:02.88
because there's some event at the beach or something.

701
00:29:02.88 --> 00:29:04.92
I do expect a little bit of what do you call it?

702
00:29:04.92 --> 00:29:05.32
Lieway.

703
00:29:05.32 --> 00:29:05.96
Lieway.

704
00:29:05.96 --> 00:29:07.44
OK.

705
00:29:07.44 --> 00:29:07.92
Kind of.

706
00:29:07.92 --> 00:29:08.92
We'll see about that.

707
00:29:08.92 --> 00:29:11.32
So that is time.

708
00:29:11.32 --> 00:29:15.80
First thing you got to be thinking about causes stress.

709
00:29:15.80 --> 00:29:18.16
Get ahead of it.

710
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:20.88
The next thing, and this should really come as no surprise,

711
00:29:20.88 --> 00:29:24.76
the next things that I think about are the four laws

712
00:29:24.76 --> 00:29:26.60
of combat leadership, cover move, simple prioritizing,

713
00:29:26.60 --> 00:29:28.08
execute, and decentralized command.

714
00:29:28.08 --> 00:29:32.12
But I think about them in a very particular way.

715
00:29:32.12 --> 00:29:34.08
So if I'm making a decision, the first thing

716
00:29:34.08 --> 00:29:35.72
I'm going to think about is cover move.

717
00:29:35.72 --> 00:29:41.08
The number one thing is, am I supporting my teammates?

718
00:29:41.08 --> 00:29:43.84
Does this help the team?

719
00:29:43.84 --> 00:29:48.12
Am I putting my team first?

720
00:29:48.12 --> 00:29:49.68
So I want you to think about that.

721
00:29:49.68 --> 00:29:50.60
The first thing I think about is time,

722
00:29:50.60 --> 00:29:51.72
because I have no control about it.

723
00:29:51.72 --> 00:29:53.44
The second thing I do is make sure

724
00:29:53.44 --> 00:29:56.04
that I am not putting myself ahead of the team

725
00:29:56.04 --> 00:29:57.40
and I'm not making a decision that's

726
00:29:57.40 --> 00:30:02.60
going to leave anyone else on the team in the lurch.

727
00:30:02.60 --> 00:30:08.28
And this will immediately vector you in the correct direction.

728
00:30:08.28 --> 00:30:13.04
Because anytime that you, as a human, are making a decision

729
00:30:13.04 --> 00:30:15.60
and it's based on benefiting you, there's

730
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:17.56
a really good chance that that's a bad call.

731
00:30:17.56 --> 00:30:19.72
And from a leadership perspective,

732
00:30:19.72 --> 00:30:21.96
there is a huge chance.

733
00:30:21.96 --> 00:30:23.52
As a matter of fact, I'm going to go ahead and say,

734
00:30:23.52 --> 00:30:24.12
that's a bad call.

735
00:30:26.64 --> 00:30:33.36
The military term is supporting distance.

736
00:30:33.36 --> 00:30:38.76
So echo, if I'm working with you, if my fire team or my squad

737
00:30:38.76 --> 00:30:41.12
or my platoon is supporting your fire team, your squad,

738
00:30:41.12 --> 00:30:44.60
your platoon, I have to stay within a distance where

739
00:30:44.60 --> 00:30:46.12
I am able to support you.

740
00:30:46.12 --> 00:30:51.000
That means usually my weapons can cover

741
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.04
where you may be attacked from.

742
00:30:54.04 --> 00:30:58.72
And my communications can speak to you directly.

743
00:30:58.72 --> 00:31:02.12
And generally speaking, in an infantry scenario,

744
00:31:02.12 --> 00:31:06.000
I want to be where I can actually see you.

745
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.48
I can actually put on my night vision or at least pull out

746
00:31:11.48 --> 00:31:13.48
my binoculars and see where you are.

747
00:31:13.48 --> 00:31:13.88
I got him.

748
00:31:13.88 --> 00:31:15.04
I know exactly where he is.

749
00:31:15.04 --> 00:31:18.52
The minute that we're out of that supporting distance,

750
00:31:18.52 --> 00:31:20.08
there's going to be a problem.

751
00:31:20.08 --> 00:31:22.92
So from a tactical perspective, that's

752
00:31:22.92 --> 00:31:24.16
a great thing to think about.

753
00:31:24.16 --> 00:31:27.12
But from a leadership perspective,

754
00:31:27.12 --> 00:31:35.04
cover and move is am I being supportive of the rest of my team?

755
00:31:35.04 --> 00:31:39.12
And if you're not, it's going to be a problem.

756
00:31:39.12 --> 00:31:41.08
Now, here's a couple of things to watch out for.

757
00:31:41.08 --> 00:31:43.92
Some people have a tendency to look out for themselves.

758
00:31:43.92 --> 00:31:49.80
And some people, if they have that tendency,

759
00:31:49.80 --> 00:31:53.08
one of the worst things about that tendency is they don't

760
00:31:53.08 --> 00:31:56.08
think anyone else can see it.

761
00:31:56.08 --> 00:32:00.28
And I'm telling you right now, when people are getting screwed,

762
00:32:00.28 --> 00:32:01.60
they see it.

763
00:32:01.60 --> 00:32:05.44
And in whatever subtle way, whatever maneuver you're doing

764
00:32:05.44 --> 00:32:09.04
that you think no one else can see that you're leaving people,

765
00:32:09.04 --> 00:32:10.64
everyone can see it.

766
00:32:10.64 --> 00:32:11.56
They can see it.

767
00:32:11.56 --> 00:32:14.56
1,000%, they can see what's going on.

768
00:32:14.56 --> 00:32:18.16
So if you think you might be a person,

769
00:32:18.16 --> 00:32:22.16
and this goes back to what are your own personal biases,

770
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:25.92
if you are a person that goes through life that kind of looks

771
00:32:25.92 --> 00:32:28.24
out for yourself, this is where you

772
00:32:28.24 --> 00:32:32.52
need to index in the right direction appropriately

773
00:32:32.52 --> 00:32:34.64
to make up the fact that you're a little bit of a person that

774
00:32:34.64 --> 00:32:36.28
takes care of yourself.

775
00:32:36.28 --> 00:32:38.96
So just watch out for that.

776
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:40.60
And the way you watch out for that

777
00:32:40.60 --> 00:32:42.52
is by when you're making a decision,

778
00:32:42.52 --> 00:32:45.000
this is the second thing you ask yourself.

779
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Am I making this decision, and it's

780
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.96
only going to benefit me?

781
00:32:48.96 --> 00:32:52.40
And more important, am I supporting my teammates

782
00:32:52.40 --> 00:32:54.72
with this decision that I'm going to make?

783
00:32:54.72 --> 00:32:58.20
And if you're not, reconsider.

784
00:32:58.20 --> 00:33:00.48
The next one is keeping things simple.

785
00:33:03.40 --> 00:33:06.36
How complicated is this decision?

786
00:33:06.36 --> 00:33:11.12
Or how much complexity will this decision add to our situation?

787
00:33:13.96 --> 00:33:16.40
And that's really a great way to think about it.

788
00:33:16.40 --> 00:33:19.32
Will this decision take our current situation

789
00:33:19.32 --> 00:33:20.32
and simplify it?

790
00:33:20.32 --> 00:33:23.60
If it's going to do that, that's very, very helpful.

791
00:33:23.60 --> 00:33:28.40
If this decision is going to make things more complex,

792
00:33:28.40 --> 00:33:32.28
this is usually not a good decision.

793
00:33:32.28 --> 00:33:33.88
So the minute you say, oh, we just

794
00:33:33.88 --> 00:33:36.68
need to get some more people down here into the mix,

795
00:33:36.68 --> 00:33:39.000
and all of a sudden you think to yourself, wait a second,

796
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.68
that's actually going to make things more complicated.

797
00:33:42.68 --> 00:33:43.68
Reconsider.

798
00:33:43.68 --> 00:33:46.72
Again, you can still, hey, any one of these things

799
00:33:46.72 --> 00:33:50.56
that I'm saying right now, there are situations where you have

800
00:33:50.56 --> 00:33:52.56
to still push through it.

801
00:33:52.56 --> 00:33:54.44
It's when you're not thinking about it.

802
00:33:54.44 --> 00:33:56.000
When you're not being intentional about your decision,

803
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.32
that's when you're going to have a problem.

804
00:33:57.32 --> 00:34:00.08
Most important, when you don't even recognize,

805
00:34:00.08 --> 00:34:02.24
a lot of times people are making things more complex.

806
00:34:02.24 --> 00:34:03.32
They don't even know it, because they're

807
00:34:03.32 --> 00:34:05.24
not considering things that I'm talking about.

808
00:34:05.24 --> 00:34:06.44
Sometimes they're screwing people over.

809
00:34:06.44 --> 00:34:08.20
They're not even thinking about it.

810
00:34:08.20 --> 00:34:09.96
Look, there's sometimes where I'm screwing over

811
00:34:09.96 --> 00:34:13.32
Echo with my decision, but I just don't think he's going

812
00:34:13.32 --> 00:34:14.36
to notice or I don't care.

813
00:34:14.36 --> 00:34:16.84
Sometimes I'm doing it, and I just,

814
00:34:16.84 --> 00:34:19.40
I don't even recognize the fact that, oh, I didn't realize

815
00:34:19.40 --> 00:34:21.60
Echo was going to get left out in the cold one time

816
00:34:21.60 --> 00:34:23.48
for you.

817
00:34:23.48 --> 00:34:26.48
Lath Bab and we were staying in a hotel at the muster,

818
00:34:26.48 --> 00:34:30.000
and we had like, I had a room, he had a room,

819
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
and they were joined by like a unit room or whatever,

820
00:34:37.84 --> 00:34:39.68
like a, what's that word?

821
00:34:39.68 --> 00:34:40.52
A common area.

822
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:41.44
Yeah, a common area.

823
00:34:41.44 --> 00:34:45.08
But actually, the entrance to my room

824
00:34:45.08 --> 00:34:47.24
was through the common area.

825
00:34:47.24 --> 00:34:48.68
And then, so to get into my room,

826
00:34:48.68 --> 00:34:50.08
you'd go through the common area,

827
00:34:50.08 --> 00:34:52.16
and then I'd go into my room.

828
00:34:52.16 --> 00:34:54.16
Lath had, he could go into the common area,

829
00:34:54.16 --> 00:34:57.28
and then to his room, or he could go through the hallway.

830
00:34:57.28 --> 00:35:01.56
So we went to PT, and I forget how it happened,

831
00:35:01.56 --> 00:35:04.44
but he locked the common area door.

832
00:35:05.68 --> 00:35:08.36
So, and then we got split up when I came back,

833
00:35:08.36 --> 00:35:10.000
I didn't have the key to his room.

834
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.60
You know that little, you know, like the key,

835
00:35:11.60 --> 00:35:14.16
the mechanical lock on a door?

836
00:35:14.16 --> 00:35:15.92
He had swung that thing shut.

837
00:35:15.92 --> 00:35:17.64
So I could, so we were laughing.

838
00:35:18.80 --> 00:35:20.32
He was actually trying to help me out,

839
00:35:20.32 --> 00:35:23.32
but he locked me out of my room, which was awesome.

840
00:35:23.32 --> 00:35:24.28
Sure, awesome.

841
00:35:24.28 --> 00:35:26.08
He didn't know, he didn't know that,

842
00:35:26.08 --> 00:35:30.12
he didn't know that we were all both gonna leave

843
00:35:30.12 --> 00:35:31.24
through his room.

844
00:35:31.24 --> 00:35:35.52
So anyways, my point is, sometimes you're doing things,

845
00:35:35.52 --> 00:35:38.28
and you don't understand the secondary effects.

846
00:35:38.28 --> 00:35:42.60
So that's one of the benefits of having a checklist.

847
00:35:42.60 --> 00:35:45.04
Because the minute you say, oh, wait a second,

848
00:35:45.04 --> 00:35:46.52
the jockel might actually have to come back in,

849
00:35:46.52 --> 00:35:47.36
and I won't be with him,

850
00:35:47.36 --> 00:35:49.80
so therefore I should open the door from the inside.

851
00:35:49.80 --> 00:35:50.96
Cool, got it, done.

852
00:35:52.76 --> 00:35:55.48
Sometimes I say, oh, I wanna do this thing,

853
00:35:55.48 --> 00:35:58.44
oh, but am I really covering for echo?

854
00:35:58.44 --> 00:36:01.48
No, I'm not, I gotta help him out, okay.

855
00:36:01.48 --> 00:36:04.88
So one of the uses of running this loop,

856
00:36:04.88 --> 00:36:05.84
and going through this checklist,

857
00:36:05.84 --> 00:36:07.32
is you make sure you're not doing something

858
00:36:07.32 --> 00:36:08.16
that doesn't make sense,

859
00:36:08.16 --> 00:36:09.80
that you weren't aware of.

860
00:36:11.72 --> 00:36:14.80
So make sure that you are covering for the rest of your team,

861
00:36:14.80 --> 00:36:16.20
make sure you're putting the team first

862
00:36:16.20 --> 00:36:17.44
when you make a decision.

863
00:36:18.76 --> 00:36:20.20
Next one, simple.

864
00:36:20.20 --> 00:36:22.28
Well, I already covered simple,

865
00:36:22.28 --> 00:36:23.36
making sure things are complicated.

866
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:24.92
The next one is prioritize and execute.

867
00:36:24.92 --> 00:36:27.96
Does this decision that I'm about to make

868
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.80
match the priorities that we should be focused on?

869
00:36:33.24 --> 00:36:35.28
That's step number one.

870
00:36:35.28 --> 00:36:37.56
Hey, wait a second, I'm about to go in this direction.

871
00:36:37.56 --> 00:36:40.36
Does that even help us getting where we wanna go?

872
00:36:40.36 --> 00:36:42.20
Then you kinda have to dig a little bit deeper.

873
00:36:42.20 --> 00:36:44.08
Are the priorities that I'm focused on right now,

874
00:36:44.08 --> 00:36:46.08
are they even correct?

875
00:36:46.08 --> 00:36:49.96
Because sometimes what you're focused on right now changes,

876
00:36:49.96 --> 00:36:52.16
and you have to adapt.

877
00:36:52.16 --> 00:36:56.24
If you and I are rolling and I'm trying to defend an armlock,

878
00:36:56.24 --> 00:36:57.000
you're trying to armlock me,

879
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.20
and all of a sudden you get my neck,

880
00:36:59.20 --> 00:37:00.76
guess what the priority is?

881
00:37:00.76 --> 00:37:04.04
Priority is my neck, protect your neck, right?

882
00:37:04.04 --> 00:37:06.40
So priorities are going to change.

883
00:37:07.80 --> 00:37:10.12
And so you have to make sure when you make a decision

884
00:37:10.12 --> 00:37:12.80
that you're supporting the right priority,

885
00:37:12.80 --> 00:37:14.96
or you're supporting the priority that you have designated,

886
00:37:14.96 --> 00:37:17.04
and you also have to double check that the priority

887
00:37:17.04 --> 00:37:19.24
that you're focused on is the right one,

888
00:37:19.24 --> 00:37:22.64
or the priorities plural that you're focused on

889
00:37:22.64 --> 00:37:24.64
are the right one's plural.

890
00:37:26.08 --> 00:37:30.08
And then once again, you gotta check your own tendencies

891
00:37:30.08 --> 00:37:32.72
because some people have a tendency to get distracted.

892
00:37:34.48 --> 00:37:38.44
And if you're a person that has tendency to get distracted,

893
00:37:39.96 --> 00:37:41.68
then you need to double down

894
00:37:41.68 --> 00:37:44.20
on making sure you focus on the right priorities.

895
00:37:44.20 --> 00:37:48.60
Some people have a tendency to try and accomplish too much.

896
00:37:48.60 --> 00:37:50.72
They have the tendency to be like,

897
00:37:50.72 --> 00:37:53.88
those people might usually have also a bad relationship

898
00:37:53.88 --> 00:37:55.40
with time where they think they can do more

899
00:37:55.40 --> 00:37:56.24
than they have time for,

900
00:37:56.24 --> 00:37:57.44
and then they also say, I can do that,

901
00:37:57.44 --> 00:37:59.40
I can do that, I can do that.

902
00:37:59.40 --> 00:38:00.88
Even though I have a good relationship with time,

903
00:38:00.88 --> 00:38:03.40
sometimes I do try and bite off more than I can chew,

904
00:38:03.40 --> 00:38:06.48
but not very often, most of the time I don't do that.

905
00:38:06.48 --> 00:38:09.72
Most of the time I could actually take the garbage out

906
00:38:09.72 --> 00:38:11.56
before I go to Jiu-Jitsu,

907
00:38:11.56 --> 00:38:13.88
but I don't wanna be two minutes late,

908
00:38:13.88 --> 00:38:15.52
so therefore I'm gonna take the garbage out later.

909
00:38:15.52 --> 00:38:16.64
I should have taken it out.

910
00:38:16.64 --> 00:38:21.28
I should have rolled the dice that there's a 0.001%

911
00:38:21.28 --> 00:38:24.56
that I'm a minute and 28 seconds late.

912
00:38:26.64 --> 00:38:28.36
So know what your tendencies.

913
00:38:28.36 --> 00:38:29.68
There's people that have a tendency

914
00:38:29.68 --> 00:38:31.12
to shift priorities too often,

915
00:38:31.12 --> 00:38:33.08
similar to being distracted, right?

916
00:38:33.08 --> 00:38:34.64
But they're like, no, we need to focus on this,

917
00:38:34.64 --> 00:38:36.48
and then three days later, no, we need to focus on this,

918
00:38:36.48 --> 00:38:38.92
and then three days later, no, we need to focus on this.

919
00:38:38.92 --> 00:38:40.12
That actually happens.

920
00:38:41.76 --> 00:38:43.000
And of course there's some people

921
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
that get fixated on a priority that may or may not matter

922
00:38:49.56 --> 00:38:53.68
as time goes on, so that can happen as well.

923
00:38:53.68 --> 00:38:56.24
So when you are making a decision,

924
00:38:56.24 --> 00:38:59.12
check your priority list,

925
00:39:00.24 --> 00:39:02.20
and make sure that your decision supports the priority,

926
00:39:02.20 --> 00:39:05.52
and then also double check that the priority you're focused on

927
00:39:05.52 --> 00:39:08.76
or priorities that you are focused on are the right ones.

928
00:39:08.76 --> 00:39:10.80
Pretty straightforward.

929
00:39:10.80 --> 00:39:13.14
Decentralize command.

930
00:39:13.14 --> 00:39:16.04
Here's a really good rule of thumb

931
00:39:16.04 --> 00:39:18.60
if you're in a leadership position.

932
00:39:18.60 --> 00:39:20.96
The decision that I'm about to make,

933
00:39:20.96 --> 00:39:25.96
can I decentralize and delegate the action?

934
00:39:28.24 --> 00:39:30.72
So as soon as I'm thinking of doing something,

935
00:39:30.72 --> 00:39:35.72
I think to myself, oh, can I turn this over to someone else?

936
00:39:37.44 --> 00:39:40.68
So hey, we gotta get that building cleared?

937
00:39:40.68 --> 00:39:42.40
Yes, we're gonna clear that building.

938
00:39:42.40 --> 00:39:45.84
Hey, Laef, grab your squad, grab your platoon,

939
00:39:45.84 --> 00:39:47.84
grab your team, go get that building cleared.

940
00:39:47.84 --> 00:39:49.84
Can I turn it over to someone else?

941
00:39:49.84 --> 00:39:54.20
Hey, Echo, we need to come up with some cool graphics

942
00:39:54.20 --> 00:39:56.64
for this event that we're gonna do.

943
00:39:56.64 --> 00:39:58.20
Can I turn that over to you?

944
00:39:58.20 --> 00:40:03.20
I wanna know if I can, because my goal is to not be focused

945
00:40:03.88 --> 00:40:06.18
on doing things myself, because the minute

946
00:40:06.18 --> 00:40:08.000
that I'm doing something myself,

947
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.40
I can't look up and I can't look out,

948
00:40:11.40 --> 00:40:13.60
which is going to impair my ability to lead.

949
00:40:14.84 --> 00:40:17.52
This also allows me to be aware.

950
00:40:17.52 --> 00:40:19.60
And again, so much of this is awareness.

951
00:40:19.60 --> 00:40:21.08
It allows me to be aware that sometimes

952
00:40:21.08 --> 00:40:23.000
there's something that I do have to do.

953
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.08
And I've gotta say, hey, Echo,

954
00:40:25.08 --> 00:40:27.72
I've gotta go do this thing, cover me.

955
00:40:27.72 --> 00:40:30.68
Or hey, Echo, I'm gonna be going and executing

956
00:40:30.68 --> 00:40:33.20
on this thing, watch my back,

957
00:40:33.20 --> 00:40:35.28
or look up and out while I'm doing this.

958
00:40:35.28 --> 00:40:37.80
So these are all things that, again,

959
00:40:37.80 --> 00:40:39.64
it's okay to make those decisions

960
00:40:39.64 --> 00:40:40.92
as long as you're aware of it.

961
00:40:40.92 --> 00:40:43.32
But the minute I go, hey, I'm gonna go execute this thing

962
00:40:43.32 --> 00:40:46.04
and I don't tell you to look out, now we get flanked.

963
00:40:49.10 --> 00:40:52.80
We're looking, hopefully, with decentralized command,

964
00:40:52.80 --> 00:40:56.78
we're hoping, and the goal is that we are only doing things

965
00:40:56.78 --> 00:40:58.28
that only we can do.

966
00:40:58.28 --> 00:41:01.24
I only wanna do things that only I can do.

967
00:41:01.24 --> 00:41:05.56
Everything else, I wanna have someone else on the team do it.

968
00:41:05.56 --> 00:41:07.20
That's the goal.

969
00:41:07.20 --> 00:41:09.40
And by the way, the things that I can do,

970
00:41:09.40 --> 00:41:11.36
I eventually want to train someone else

971
00:41:11.36 --> 00:41:12.92
to be able to do those things.

972
00:41:13.96 --> 00:41:15.44
How do you balance the,

973
00:41:17.84 --> 00:41:21.12
okay, remember, it was your story about

974
00:41:22.12 --> 00:41:23.84
somebody came to you, it was like,

975
00:41:23.84 --> 00:41:24.84
I need this advice, whatever,

976
00:41:24.84 --> 00:41:26.72
and you said, put them in charge of something they put,

977
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:28.64
and then that person put them in charge of something

978
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:30.96
that was really undesirable, like cleaning.

979
00:41:30.96 --> 00:41:34.56
Cleaning toilets at SEAL Team 2 on the second deck.

980
00:41:34.56 --> 00:41:36.40
That was the mission someone was tasked with

981
00:41:36.40 --> 00:41:38.28
in order to give them more responsibility.

982
00:41:38.28 --> 00:41:40.20
And it didn't help the situation, it made them more mad.

983
00:41:40.20 --> 00:41:42.20
So how do you find the balance?

984
00:41:42.20 --> 00:41:44.28
Because kinda in a way that kinda,

985
00:41:44.28 --> 00:41:46.56
in a matter of speaking, translates over to

986
00:41:46.56 --> 00:41:48.32
what you're talking about now where it's like,

987
00:41:48.32 --> 00:41:49.56
hey, can I delegate this?

988
00:41:49.56 --> 00:41:50.40
Can I delegate this?

989
00:41:50.40 --> 00:41:53.84
Which a lot of times, depending on the project

990
00:41:53.84 --> 00:41:56.32
of delegation, it can empower someone,

991
00:41:56.32 --> 00:41:58.24
it can help the whole group, because they can do this

992
00:41:58.24 --> 00:42:00.52
while you're doing quote unquote more important things

993
00:42:00.52 --> 00:42:01.36
or whatever.

994
00:42:01.36 --> 00:42:03.72
How do you balance what you delegate them to do

995
00:42:03.72 --> 00:42:07.96
with something important or whatever versus something that,

996
00:42:07.96 --> 00:42:09.40
cause you know something needs to be done

997
00:42:09.40 --> 00:42:11.44
but no one really wants to do it kind of a thing?

998
00:42:11.44 --> 00:42:14.88
Hey, if something sucks, I'm gonna get in there

999
00:42:14.88 --> 00:42:15.72
and do it somehow.

1000
00:42:15.72 --> 00:42:17.40
This is the picking up brass story, right?

1001
00:42:17.40 --> 00:42:20.88
Because picking up brass, it's real easy to say,

1002
00:42:20.88 --> 00:42:22.36
you know what guys, I gotta go back to

1003
00:42:22.36 --> 00:42:23.24
meet with the commanding officer,

1004
00:42:23.24 --> 00:42:24.36
I gotta go back and prep a brief,

1005
00:42:24.36 --> 00:42:26.32
so I'll be back in the air conditioned office,

1006
00:42:26.32 --> 00:42:28.64
back in San Diego, while you guys are out here

1007
00:42:28.64 --> 00:42:31.52
in 120 degree heat picking up brass.

1008
00:42:31.52 --> 00:42:33.04
Real easy to say that.

1009
00:42:33.04 --> 00:42:37.64
So decisions like that, I'm gonna be very cautious

1010
00:42:37.64 --> 00:42:39.16
and I'm gonna weigh my leadership capital,

1011
00:42:39.16 --> 00:42:42.000
which we'll get to, because if, look,

1012
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.64
does this mean if the commanding officer's like,

1013
00:42:43.64 --> 00:42:44.96
hey, I need a brief tomorrow, I'm like,

1014
00:42:44.96 --> 00:42:46.44
sorry sir, I'm picking up brass?

1015
00:42:46.44 --> 00:42:48.56
No, it doesn't mean that.

1016
00:42:48.56 --> 00:42:53.56
But I better prioritize building a relationship

1017
00:42:54.04 --> 00:42:55.84
with the troops, making sure they understand

1018
00:42:55.84 --> 00:42:57.48
that I don't mind getting my hands dirty,

1019
00:42:57.48 --> 00:43:00.52
don't mind getting my knees freaking cut up,

1020
00:43:00.52 --> 00:43:02.52
don't mind having blisters on my hands

1021
00:43:02.52 --> 00:43:05.60
and picking up hot brass out in the desert.

1022
00:43:05.60 --> 00:43:07.000
That's what I'm gonna do.

1023
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.76
So there's some variables that we have to weigh into.

1024
00:43:11.76 --> 00:43:16.000
And that's also why good deals give them away, you know?

1025
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.24
Hey, someone's gotta go ashore early

1026
00:43:18.24 --> 00:43:22.40
and spend an extra four days in wherever,

1027
00:43:22.40 --> 00:43:26.88
this nice vacation area of Thailand.

1028
00:43:26.88 --> 00:43:29.36
It's like, oh, no, I'm gonna go on the ad bond.

1029
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:33.32
And it's like, no, no, hey, echo, you gotta take these guys,

1030
00:43:33.32 --> 00:43:35.000
make sure we have the stuff that we need

1031
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.28
for the training in Thailand.

1032
00:43:36.28 --> 00:43:38.12
And you're like, awesome, right?

1033
00:43:38.12 --> 00:43:40.44
So that's how I weigh it out.

1034
00:43:40.44 --> 00:43:45.44
I have to assess the suck meter.

1035
00:43:45.80 --> 00:43:48.48
And if you're a person that always sees the suck meter high

1036
00:43:48.48 --> 00:43:51.40
and runs the other way, everybody knows it.

1037
00:43:51.40 --> 00:43:53.20
So don't do it.

1038
00:43:53.20 --> 00:43:55.20
So it's kind of a little balancing act game

1039
00:43:55.20 --> 00:43:56.88
within the game kind of a thing.

1040
00:43:56.88 --> 00:43:57.72
100%.

1041
00:43:57.72 --> 00:43:59.32
Yeah, because if you just be rigid,

1042
00:43:59.32 --> 00:44:00.80
or this is what it seems like anyway,

1043
00:44:00.80 --> 00:44:03.16
if you just be rigid to the, hey, I'm always gonna delegate

1044
00:44:03.16 --> 00:44:05.24
and then it's when it comes to, you know,

1045
00:44:06.56 --> 00:44:08.76
oh, trash needs to be taken out.

1046
00:44:08.76 --> 00:44:11.20
I got an extra three minutes or whatever now,

1047
00:44:11.20 --> 00:44:12.60
but no, no, no, I'm sticking to the rule.

1048
00:44:12.60 --> 00:44:14.72
Delegate, delegate, you know, kind of a thing.

1049
00:44:14.72 --> 00:44:18.76
No, things that suck, try not to delegate.

1050
00:44:18.76 --> 00:44:20.40
And look, that could also mean

1051
00:44:20.40 --> 00:44:22.68
if you're the platoon commander,

1052
00:44:22.68 --> 00:44:24.20
guess what you're doing all day?

1053
00:44:24.20 --> 00:44:26.36
Cleaning the toilets, picking up brass,

1054
00:44:26.36 --> 00:44:27.80
like you could be, you get to sign yourself

1055
00:44:27.80 --> 00:44:30.36
every task that kind of sucks.

1056
00:44:30.36 --> 00:44:31.96
And we don't wanna do that.

1057
00:44:31.96 --> 00:44:34.28
So we have to put that into the calculus.

1058
00:44:34.28 --> 00:44:36.68
We don't just delegate things that suck.

1059
00:44:36.68 --> 00:44:39.08
In fact, you know, the late, late tells the story,

1060
00:44:39.08 --> 00:44:43.64
we were going through the our dive portion of training

1061
00:44:43.64 --> 00:44:46.16
and diving kind of sucks, you know,

1062
00:44:46.16 --> 00:44:49.36
it's cold, wet, miserable, long, boring.

1063
00:44:49.36 --> 00:44:51.32
And some people think,

1064
00:44:51.32 --> 00:44:54.48
and so a lot of guys had given the opportunity,

1065
00:44:54.48 --> 00:44:56.96
they have meetings to attend during time.

1066
00:44:56.96 --> 00:45:00.48
They have whatever reports to write.

1067
00:45:00.48 --> 00:45:03.64
And Leif and Seth, you know,

1068
00:45:03.64 --> 00:45:04.96
they were kind of like surprised,

1069
00:45:04.96 --> 00:45:07.24
here I am, got my wetsuit on, got my fins out,

1070
00:45:07.24 --> 00:45:08.36
we're ready to go dive,

1071
00:45:08.36 --> 00:45:10.88
ready to go spend four hours turtle backing around

1072
00:45:10.88 --> 00:45:14.56
San Diego Bay and picking three hours on bag

1073
00:45:14.56 --> 00:45:18.32
in the darkness, you know, bored out of your mind,

1074
00:45:18.32 --> 00:45:19.68
but that's what you do.

1075
00:45:19.68 --> 00:45:24.68
So that's one of those things where if it sucks,

1076
00:45:24.68 --> 00:45:26.40
use caution while delegating.

1077
00:45:27.88 --> 00:45:28.72
Make sense?

1078
00:45:28.72 --> 00:45:29.80
Fully, yeah, fully.

1079
00:45:29.80 --> 00:45:33.44
It's the kind of more of the approach to it, right?

1080
00:45:33.44 --> 00:45:35.32
Where it's like, you gotta understand the overall picture

1081
00:45:35.32 --> 00:45:37.40
of what are you doing here, you know?

1082
00:45:37.40 --> 00:45:38.84
And why are you doing it kind of a thing?

1083
00:45:38.84 --> 00:45:41.96
So if you have more important things to do,

1084
00:45:41.96 --> 00:45:43.12
you delegate these things,

1085
00:45:43.12 --> 00:45:44.76
they're all important because they're all pieces

1086
00:45:44.76 --> 00:45:46.12
of the puzzle.

1087
00:45:46.12 --> 00:45:49.48
But yeah, there's another, like I said, game kind of

1088
00:45:49.48 --> 00:45:54.08
going on where you wanna be looking out for everyone

1089
00:45:54.08 --> 00:45:57.36
in that little additional way, you know?

1090
00:45:57.36 --> 00:46:00.48
And you're gonna sacrifice little parts of kind of yourself

1091
00:46:00.48 --> 00:46:02.20
to kind of do it.

1092
00:46:05.76 --> 00:46:08.80
So we kind of got the four laws of combat covered.

1093
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:10.72
The next thing I'm gonna think about,

1094
00:46:10.72 --> 00:46:13.08
and this is a big one,

1095
00:46:13.08 --> 00:46:17.16
is making sure that our ego is not driving this decision,

1096
00:46:17.16 --> 00:46:20.84
which you would be shocked and dismayed

1097
00:46:20.84 --> 00:46:25.84
at the number of decisions that are driven by ego.

1098
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:28.12
Driven by ego.

1099
00:46:28.12 --> 00:46:31.16
They're almost 100% in some cases driven by ego.

1100
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:36.04
Am I making this decision based on my ego?

1101
00:46:36.04 --> 00:46:39.36
Am I imposing it as punishment,

1102
00:46:40.40 --> 00:46:43.64
subconscious punishment on someone who questioned me?

1103
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:48.64
Am I forcing this to prove to echo

1104
00:46:49.40 --> 00:46:52.28
that my plan was the better plan?

1105
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.68
So you have to be extremely cautious of that.

1106
00:46:58.76 --> 00:47:00.32
And the thing that we have to be careful of

1107
00:47:00.32 --> 00:47:05.000
is that our ego can absolutely, not even,

1108
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.72
your ego is going to lie to you.

1109
00:47:07.68 --> 00:47:08.56
That's what our ego does.

1110
00:47:08.56 --> 00:47:10.20
Our ego is going to lie to us.

1111
00:47:11.36 --> 00:47:13.28
And if it's tricky too,

1112
00:47:13.28 --> 00:47:17.68
your ego's smart, your ego's, it's like the devil.

1113
00:47:17.68 --> 00:47:19.16
You ever seen the movie The Exorcist?

1114
00:47:19.16 --> 00:47:20.000
Yes.

1115
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.48
So in the movie The Exorcist,

1116
00:47:21.48 --> 00:47:26.24
the devil knows the things to say to the priest

1117
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:28.24
that's gonna get him.

1118
00:47:29.68 --> 00:47:34.16
And your ego is equally smart as the devil.

1119
00:47:34.16 --> 00:47:36.80
And it knows, my ego's like,

1120
00:47:36.80 --> 00:47:41.80
hey, hey, Jocko, I know I get extreme ownership.

1121
00:47:41.80 --> 00:47:45.08
Hey, I buy into extreme ownership 100%.

1122
00:47:45.08 --> 00:47:48.72
But this time is actually really is Echo's fault.

1123
00:47:49.72 --> 00:47:52.68
Echo's plan's really not as good as yours.

1124
00:47:52.68 --> 00:47:53.84
I get it.

1125
00:47:53.84 --> 00:47:55.36
I know you wanna be humble,

1126
00:47:55.36 --> 00:47:56.96
but hey, if you're humble now,

1127
00:47:56.96 --> 00:47:58.32
it's actually gonna cost you in the long run.

1128
00:47:58.32 --> 00:48:00.36
That's the way your ego talks to you.

1129
00:48:00.36 --> 00:48:04.64
It's like a little savage in there, just manipulating.

1130
00:48:04.64 --> 00:48:06.80
So you gotta be very careful of that.

1131
00:48:06.80 --> 00:48:08.04
The other thing that happens is,

1132
00:48:08.04 --> 00:48:10.64
if your ego's running the decision,

1133
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:12.92
have you listened to anybody else?

1134
00:48:12.92 --> 00:48:17.08
Have you listened to other people with an open mind?

1135
00:48:17.08 --> 00:48:19.16
Do you have an open mind?

1136
00:48:19.16 --> 00:48:20.80
So be careful of that.

1137
00:48:20.80 --> 00:48:24.24
Cause sometimes we're listening, but we're not hearing.

1138
00:48:24.24 --> 00:48:26.92
And then a good little sanity check,

1139
00:48:26.92 --> 00:48:28.36
am I doing this?

1140
00:48:28.36 --> 00:48:30.12
Am I using this decision?

1141
00:48:30.12 --> 00:48:34.12
Am I driving this decision with my rank,

1142
00:48:34.12 --> 00:48:35.24
with my position?

1143
00:48:37.08 --> 00:48:38.36
Even with my experience.

1144
00:48:38.36 --> 00:48:40.32
And let me explain what that sounds like.

1145
00:48:40.32 --> 00:48:43.16
The idea of driving, it sounds good, right?

1146
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:44.28
It sounds good for me to say,

1147
00:48:44.28 --> 00:48:46.08
hey, I'm more experienced.

1148
00:48:46.08 --> 00:48:48.72
That's why I'm making this decision.

1149
00:48:48.72 --> 00:48:50.68
But that's the equivalent as,

1150
00:48:51.64 --> 00:48:53.56
dude, I've been doing this for 20 years.

1151
00:48:53.56 --> 00:48:55.48
You need to shut up and listen to me.

1152
00:48:56.32 --> 00:49:01.000
Any of those things, if the main driver of your decision

1153
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.84
and the way you're convincing people is through experience

1154
00:49:03.84 --> 00:49:06.000
or through rank or through position or authority,

1155
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.20
you already lost.

1156
00:49:07.20 --> 00:49:10.48
You already, let me just say you lost,

1157
00:49:10.48 --> 00:49:12.88
but you need to reconsider what's happening.

1158
00:49:12.88 --> 00:49:15.68
Because if I can't articulate to you, Echo Charles,

1159
00:49:15.68 --> 00:49:17.52
why I made this decision without saying,

1160
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:20.000
cause I outrank you or because I'm in charge of this

1161
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.20
or because I've done this type of thing 20 times,

1162
00:49:23.20 --> 00:49:26.16
if I have to go there, that means I'm not really,

1163
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:28.60
I can't articulate why we're going with my plan.

1164
00:49:28.60 --> 00:49:29.60
And that's a problem.

1165
00:49:29.60 --> 00:49:32.36
And the problem most likely is my ego.

1166
00:49:33.84 --> 00:49:35.04
So use caution on that.

1167
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:40.04
And right tied up next to that is emotion.

1168
00:49:41.76 --> 00:49:44.88
Am I making an emotional decision?

1169
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:50.48
I mean, what a smart little thing to check on.

1170
00:49:50.48 --> 00:49:54.68
And if you check on it, you're gonna realize

1171
00:49:54.68 --> 00:49:56.56
that it's a bad move.

1172
00:49:56.56 --> 00:49:58.56
People make emotional decisions all the time.

1173
00:49:58.56 --> 00:50:01.64
And by the way, they almost never turn out good.

1174
00:50:01.64 --> 00:50:02.64
Am I mad?

1175
00:50:02.64 --> 00:50:03.72
Am I frustrated?

1176
00:50:03.72 --> 00:50:07.40
Am I vengeful?

1177
00:50:07.40 --> 00:50:09.28
Am I fearful?

1178
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:12.20
Am I guilty?

1179
00:50:12.20 --> 00:50:14.44
Guilt is an emotion.

1180
00:50:14.44 --> 00:50:15.44
That'll make you do something

1181
00:50:15.44 --> 00:50:17.40
that you know you shouldn't do.

1182
00:50:17.40 --> 00:50:19.60
Fear is an emotion that'll make you do something

1183
00:50:19.60 --> 00:50:20.90
that you shouldn't do.

1184
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:23.88
Frustration.

1185
00:50:23.88 --> 00:50:24.72
I'm getting frustrated.

1186
00:50:24.72 --> 00:50:26.24
You don't want to just go ahead and do it, right?

1187
00:50:26.24 --> 00:50:27.72
These are horrible things.

1188
00:50:29.12 --> 00:50:32.20
So check with yourself and make sure

1189
00:50:32.20 --> 00:50:34.08
that your emotions are not driving the decision.

1190
00:50:34.08 --> 00:50:35.92
Now listen, here's the other thing.

1191
00:50:35.92 --> 00:50:37.68
Here's the dichotomy.

1192
00:50:37.68 --> 00:50:40.88
Is your emotions do still have to be part of the calculus?

1193
00:50:40.88 --> 00:50:42.52
They gotta be part of the calculus.

1194
00:50:42.52 --> 00:50:46.84
You gotta calculate your own emotions to get the answer.

1195
00:50:46.84 --> 00:50:49.24
You gotta calculate the emotions of the team

1196
00:50:49.24 --> 00:50:50.08
to get the answer.

1197
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:54.88
Because if the team is all mad about doing this thing.

1198
00:50:54.88 --> 00:50:55.92
And I say, you know what though?

1199
00:50:55.92 --> 00:50:57.40
Logically, we should do it.

1200
00:50:57.40 --> 00:50:59.12
All right guys, this is the logical answer.

1201
00:50:59.12 --> 00:50:59.96
Go do it.

1202
00:50:59.96 --> 00:51:01.72
And all it does is make everyone matter.

1203
00:51:01.72 --> 00:51:03.52
First of all, are you gonna execute well?

1204
00:51:03.52 --> 00:51:04.72
Are you gonna do a good job?

1205
00:51:04.72 --> 00:51:06.60
Are you trustworthy while you're out there and you're mad?

1206
00:51:06.60 --> 00:51:07.92
What did it do to my leadership capital?

1207
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:09.52
All these problems is gonna cause.

1208
00:51:10.60 --> 00:51:11.84
All these problems is gonna cause.

1209
00:51:11.84 --> 00:51:15.58
So I have to put emotions into the calculus.

1210
00:51:17.24 --> 00:51:20.98
But it can't be the overwhelming driver

1211
00:51:20.98 --> 00:51:22.08
of my decision making.

1212
00:51:22.08 --> 00:51:24.72
It has to be a component.

1213
00:51:24.72 --> 00:51:28.28
But it should be a small component in most cases.

1214
00:51:28.28 --> 00:51:31.20
Meaning, if I know that making some decision

1215
00:51:31.20 --> 00:51:34.56
is gonna make the entire team totally irate.

1216
00:51:34.56 --> 00:51:35.92
I need to wait it a little bit more

1217
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:37.52
because the emotion is stronger.

1218
00:51:38.88 --> 00:51:41.64
But you have to calculate it.

1219
00:51:41.64 --> 00:51:43.12
And if you're not aware of it,

1220
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:44.60
if you're not paying attention to it,

1221
00:51:44.60 --> 00:51:47.48
then it's not gonna work out the way you want it to.

1222
00:51:47.48 --> 00:51:50.90
It's gonna actually cause bad decisions.

1223
00:51:53.24 --> 00:51:54.88
Next one, perspective.

1224
00:51:54.88 --> 00:51:59.36
Perspective people throw this around.

1225
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:00.52
People throw this around.

1226
00:52:00.52 --> 00:52:04.56
Make sure you know what other people's perspectives is.

1227
00:52:04.56 --> 00:52:07.48
But they only throw it around when they think about it.

1228
00:52:07.48 --> 00:52:11.000
But a lot of times we get locked into our perspective

1229
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.06
and that's bad.

1230
00:52:13.06 --> 00:52:16.18
I wanna see as many different perspectives on a subject,

1231
00:52:16.18 --> 00:52:19.24
on a topic, on an idea that I can.

1232
00:52:19.24 --> 00:52:21.40
I wanna know my peers' perspectives.

1233
00:52:21.40 --> 00:52:22.96
I wanna know my subordinates' perspectives.

1234
00:52:22.96 --> 00:52:24.96
I wanna know my superiors' perspectives.

1235
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:27.54
I wanna know my competitors or my enemies' perspective.

1236
00:52:27.54 --> 00:52:29.28
What are they actually seeing right now?

1237
00:52:29.28 --> 00:52:34.28
The more angles I see of a target or of a problem,

1238
00:52:36.52 --> 00:52:39.04
the better I can understand it.

1239
00:52:40.52 --> 00:52:42.96
And the better I can understand it,

1240
00:52:42.96 --> 00:52:45.64
the better off I'm going to be.

1241
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:48.60
And we have this thing when you do a reconnaissance

1242
00:52:48.60 --> 00:52:53.000
of a target, a building or a compound.

1243
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.72
When you do it, what you try and do is you try

1244
00:52:55.72 --> 00:52:58.76
and move around the entire perimeter over a period of time.

1245
00:52:58.76 --> 00:53:01.84
You try and see it from every different possible angle.

1246
00:53:01.84 --> 00:53:03.72
If you don't see something from every possible angle,

1247
00:53:03.72 --> 00:53:04.68
there's something that you're missing.

1248
00:53:04.68 --> 00:53:06.36
And that thing that you're missing

1249
00:53:06.36 --> 00:53:09.52
could be a critical component of the target

1250
00:53:09.52 --> 00:53:11.24
or of the problem.

1251
00:53:11.24 --> 00:53:13.40
So by asking your subordinates,

1252
00:53:13.40 --> 00:53:15.04
hey, what does this look like to you?

1253
00:53:15.04 --> 00:53:17.04
By asking your peers, like, hey, what do you see here?

1254
00:53:17.04 --> 00:53:18.72
By asking your boss, hey, what does it look like

1255
00:53:18.72 --> 00:53:20.64
from your perspective?

1256
00:53:20.64 --> 00:53:24.26
By doing that, it's gonna give you a better understanding

1257
00:53:24.26 --> 00:53:26.08
of the target, of the problem, of the issue,

1258
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:28.72
and then you can better formulate a plan.

1259
00:53:28.72 --> 00:53:32.44
And by the way, my default mode

1260
00:53:33.72 --> 00:53:37.16
is to take, when someone else says,

1261
00:53:37.16 --> 00:53:39.12
hey, Jocko, I see a solution,

1262
00:53:39.12 --> 00:53:41.80
my default mode is to try and utilize their solution,

1263
00:53:41.80 --> 00:53:44.92
try and utilize their plan, try and utilize their idea.

1264
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:46.24
That's my default mode.

1265
00:53:48.16 --> 00:53:49.84
Now, if there's a leadership vacuum,

1266
00:53:49.84 --> 00:53:51.76
and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics,

1267
00:53:51.76 --> 00:53:53.72
field manual, if there's a vacuum,

1268
00:53:53.72 --> 00:53:55.94
no one's making a decision, sure.

1269
00:53:55.94 --> 00:53:57.76
I'm gonna step in.

1270
00:53:57.76 --> 00:54:00.28
I'm gonna give you some little hints here.

1271
00:54:00.28 --> 00:54:01.94
When there's a leadership vacuum,

1272
00:54:01.94 --> 00:54:04.36
I'm gonna let that leadership vacuum develop it

1273
00:54:04.36 --> 00:54:06.94
a little bit extra, just a little bit extra.

1274
00:54:06.94 --> 00:54:10.96
I'm gonna let that void, let the presence of that silence,

1275
00:54:10.96 --> 00:54:13.64
of that non-direction, of that lack of leadership.

1276
00:54:13.64 --> 00:54:18.48
I'm gonna let it sit there for an extra second, two seconds.

1277
00:54:18.48 --> 00:54:19.40
Why am I doing that?

1278
00:54:19.40 --> 00:54:21.56
Because I want everyone to know

1279
00:54:21.56 --> 00:54:23.28
that there's a leadership void.

1280
00:54:23.28 --> 00:54:24.64
And it doesn't take long, it takes a second,

1281
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:25.96
it takes two seconds, three seconds.

1282
00:54:25.96 --> 00:54:27.16
And all of a sudden, everyone goes,

1283
00:54:27.16 --> 00:54:29.92
oh, and when everyone knows there's a leadership void,

1284
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:32.72
everyone is primed to execute.

1285
00:54:32.72 --> 00:54:36.04
Everyone is ready to receive orders.

1286
00:54:37.60 --> 00:54:40.20
So, if there's a leadership void,

1287
00:54:40.20 --> 00:54:41.20
I'm gonna make sure everyone can feel it.

1288
00:54:41.20 --> 00:54:42.52
By the way, those extra two, three seconds,

1289
00:54:42.52 --> 00:54:45.12
I'm actually confirming the plan in my head

1290
00:54:45.12 --> 00:54:46.14
that I have formulated.

1291
00:54:46.14 --> 00:54:48.64
So now my plan is gonna be two or three seconds

1292
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:51.16
further developed and better.

1293
00:54:51.16 --> 00:54:52.52
And then I make the call.

1294
00:54:52.52 --> 00:54:56.32
And yes, I'm gonna make a small call, an iterative decision.

1295
00:54:56.32 --> 00:55:00.36
And if someone else happens to make a call at the same time,

1296
00:55:00.36 --> 00:55:01.28
guess what I'm gonna do?

1297
00:55:01.28 --> 00:55:03.60
I'm gonna support their call.

1298
00:55:03.60 --> 00:55:05.20
Because that's my default mode.

1299
00:55:06.44 --> 00:55:09.98
My default mode is to support someone else's call.

1300
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:14.56
Because that is the easiest way to move forward with a plan.

1301
00:55:14.56 --> 00:55:16.64
The easiest way to move forward with a plan

1302
00:55:16.64 --> 00:55:18.92
isn't with Echo has a plan and I have a plan

1303
00:55:18.92 --> 00:55:21.20
to try and convince Echo that my plan is better.

1304
00:55:21.20 --> 00:55:23.32
The easiest way, the quickest way to move is to say,

1305
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:25.28
Echo, sounds good, I'm on board.

1306
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:26.12
What do you want me to do?

1307
00:55:26.12 --> 00:55:27.32
How can I support?

1308
00:55:27.32 --> 00:55:31.64
Unless Echo's plan is freaking horrible.

1309
00:55:32.56 --> 00:55:36.20
Actually, let me rephrase that in a more distinct way.

1310
00:55:36.20 --> 00:55:39.76
Unless Echo's plan is unviable.

1311
00:55:39.76 --> 00:55:42.16
It's an unviable plan that will not work.

1312
00:55:42.16 --> 00:55:44.28
If it's a minimally viable plan,

1313
00:55:46.12 --> 00:55:47.84
it'll get the job done.

1314
00:55:47.84 --> 00:55:50.32
You have a minimally viable plan and I have a viable plan.

1315
00:55:50.32 --> 00:55:52.68
So that means mine might be a little bit better.

1316
00:55:52.68 --> 00:55:54.20
But now I have to convince you of that.

1317
00:55:54.20 --> 00:55:55.32
I have to explain why.

1318
00:55:55.32 --> 00:55:57.000
And by the way, when I say I'm gonna support your plan,

1319
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.48
I can probably bring some additional viability

1320
00:55:59.48 --> 00:56:01.28
to your plan that can make your plan better

1321
00:56:01.28 --> 00:56:02.60
than mine was in the first place.

1322
00:56:02.60 --> 00:56:03.96
So that's what I'm gonna do.

1323
00:56:05.08 --> 00:56:06.32
That's the easiest way to do it.

1324
00:56:06.32 --> 00:56:09.000
Now, what do we need to think about here?

1325
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.16
Is we need to think about the fact that we almost all,

1326
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:15.56
here's a bias, that almost all of us have the same bias,

1327
00:56:15.56 --> 00:56:17.76
which is my idea is the best idea.

1328
00:56:17.76 --> 00:56:22.76
That's our general consideration as humans.

1329
00:56:22.96 --> 00:56:25.48
My idea is the best idea.

1330
00:56:25.48 --> 00:56:27.64
So know that you have that bias.

1331
00:56:27.64 --> 00:56:29.80
I actually go hard against that bias.

1332
00:56:29.80 --> 00:56:34.20
And quite frankly, sometimes I go too hard against that bias.

1333
00:56:34.20 --> 00:56:36.96
Sometimes someone's got a plan, I'm like, eh.

1334
00:56:36.96 --> 00:56:41.20
And it might be minimally, really minimally viable.

1335
00:56:42.44 --> 00:56:44.84
And I'll be like, you know what, we'll go with it.

1336
00:56:44.84 --> 00:56:47.20
Sometimes I do that a little bit too much.

1337
00:56:47.20 --> 00:56:48.16
So I know that.

1338
00:56:48.16 --> 00:56:49.76
Why do you think you do that?

1339
00:56:50.92 --> 00:56:52.56
Just wanna be supportive.

1340
00:56:52.56 --> 00:56:56.60
Don't wanna be a imposing tyrant on the team.

1341
00:56:56.60 --> 00:57:00.24
And generally, I'm like, thinking to myself,

1342
00:57:00.24 --> 00:57:01.08
oh, you know, my plan's good,

1343
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:03.28
but we can probably make Eglas' plan worth.

1344
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:04.40
I would rather do it.

1345
00:57:04.40 --> 00:57:05.36
Why? I'll tell you why.

1346
00:57:05.36 --> 00:57:07.12
I literally believe what I'm saying right now.

1347
00:57:07.12 --> 00:57:09.84
It's usually easier for me just to support your plan

1348
00:57:09.84 --> 00:57:12.04
than it is for me to convince you of this other plan

1349
00:57:12.04 --> 00:57:13.24
and explain it to you.

1350
00:57:13.24 --> 00:57:14.92
I can uptake your plan pretty quick.

1351
00:57:14.92 --> 00:57:16.76
I get it cool, let's go execute that thing.

1352
00:57:16.76 --> 00:57:18.96
I'm supporting you, let's run with it.

1353
00:57:18.96 --> 00:57:20.68
And then I'm detached from your plan

1354
00:57:20.68 --> 00:57:22.40
so I can see a little bit more when it's my plan.

1355
00:57:22.40 --> 00:57:24.52
All of a sudden, I gotta manage that whole thing

1356
00:57:24.52 --> 00:57:25.48
and I'm staring right into it.

1357
00:57:25.48 --> 00:57:28.000
And I don't know how good you are at being detached

1358
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.16
and trying to adjust things.

1359
00:57:29.16 --> 00:57:30.12
You might not be as good as me.

1360
00:57:30.12 --> 00:57:30.96
So you know what?

1361
00:57:30.96 --> 00:57:34.000
I'm gonna let you, detachment is a harder skill

1362
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.32
than the planning and execution.

1363
00:57:38.48 --> 00:57:40.68
Or it's a rarer skill.

1364
00:57:40.68 --> 00:57:42.60
If I tell you to go and execute something,

1365
00:57:42.60 --> 00:57:45.08
there's a good chance you'll be able to do it.

1366
00:57:45.08 --> 00:57:47.36
If I tell you, hey, I'm gonna go execute,

1367
00:57:47.36 --> 00:57:50.68
you detach and sit on the outside

1368
00:57:50.68 --> 00:57:53.52
and try and give me some broad guidance

1369
00:57:53.52 --> 00:57:54.52
about how I can do better.

1370
00:57:54.52 --> 00:57:55.76
That's a harder job.

1371
00:57:55.76 --> 00:57:58.08
Because most of the time you'll be like,

1372
00:57:58.08 --> 00:57:59.16
I'm starting to execute my plan,

1373
00:57:59.16 --> 00:58:00.04
you're gonna jump in there with me,

1374
00:58:00.04 --> 00:58:02.000
you're gonna start doing it too.

1375
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
So that's why I sort of overindex on allowing,

1376
00:58:07.28 --> 00:58:10.000
on providing support or allowing people to do things

1377
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.32
that maybe I don't 100% agree with.

1378
00:58:13.32 --> 00:58:16.52
I mean, you've done some stuff where I've been like,

1379
00:58:16.52 --> 00:58:21.12
well, that didn't seem to be the best idea, was it?

1380
00:58:21.12 --> 00:58:24.16
And we can look back post-mortem.

1381
00:58:24.16 --> 00:58:25.64
Is this a Christmas music thing?

1382
00:58:25.64 --> 00:58:27.32
Christmas music, that's a good one, right?

1383
00:58:27.32 --> 00:58:28.68
Get that over it.

1384
00:58:28.68 --> 00:58:31.04
You know, some things happen, you're like,

1385
00:58:31.04 --> 00:58:34.48
you're not good, that's not what we were looking for at all.

1386
00:58:34.48 --> 00:58:36.96
Did you say you didn't even know that was a Christmas song?

1387
00:58:36.96 --> 00:58:38.32
Damn, that's correct.

1388
00:58:38.32 --> 00:58:40.44
They know, I don't know, sorry.

1389
00:58:40.44 --> 00:58:42.04
I do now though, so.

1390
00:58:42.04 --> 00:58:43.64
You gotta watch out for that one.

1391
00:58:43.64 --> 00:58:45.56
So that's the deal.

1392
00:58:45.56 --> 00:58:50.36
It's perspective, you have to actually pull yourself back

1393
00:58:50.36 --> 00:58:53.16
and try and see other people's perspectives.

1394
00:58:53.16 --> 00:58:55.24
And the best way to do that is by talking to them,

1395
00:58:55.24 --> 00:58:57.72
asking them good questions about what they see.

1396
00:58:57.72 --> 00:59:02.56
You're not gonna be a freak and, what's the word?

1397
00:59:02.56 --> 00:59:06.20
A psychic that I can see what Echo sees.

1398
00:59:06.20 --> 00:59:07.92
I don't go into a meditative state

1399
00:59:07.92 --> 00:59:09.60
and go into your brain.

1400
00:59:09.60 --> 00:59:11.16
No, I go, hey Echo, what does that look like to you?

1401
00:59:11.16 --> 00:59:15.08
This isn't freaking, this isn't freaking remote viewing.

1402
00:59:15.08 --> 00:59:17.48
This isn't remote viewing.

1403
00:59:17.48 --> 00:59:18.48
This isn't remote viewing.

1404
00:59:18.48 --> 00:59:19.32
What's the deal with Rome?

1405
00:59:19.32 --> 00:59:20.32
Do you think it's true?

1406
00:59:20.32 --> 00:59:21.16
I don't know.

1407
00:59:21.16 --> 00:59:23.36
They had big programs with it in the military.

1408
00:59:23.36 --> 00:59:24.88
There's a movie about it.

1409
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:27.44
Yeah, I mean, I don't, if it is true,

1410
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:29.08
I don't know how it works at all.

1411
00:59:29.08 --> 00:59:30.12
It doesn't seem.

1412
00:59:30.12 --> 00:59:32.20
It could be, the guys are really good at guessing.

1413
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:33.76
Maybe, you know.

1414
00:59:33.76 --> 00:59:35.40
Well, a lot of the, what do you call it,

1415
00:59:35.40 --> 00:59:38.08
like the psychic, you know, mediums and minorities

1416
00:59:38.08 --> 00:59:40.72
and stuff, that's as it turns out from what I understand,

1417
00:59:40.72 --> 00:59:41.56
that's what it is.

1418
00:59:41.56 --> 00:59:44.64
It's not guessing, but it's like guessing about,

1419
00:59:44.64 --> 00:59:47.16
like they react to cues with you,

1420
00:59:47.16 --> 00:59:48.12
like how you respond.

1421
00:59:48.12 --> 00:59:49.40
So it's like, I'm seeing red.

1422
00:59:49.40 --> 00:59:50.88
And then if they do something, they're like,

1423
00:59:50.88 --> 00:59:52.48
okay, red is something, you know?

1424
00:59:52.48 --> 00:59:54.36
Do you know a person name?

1425
00:59:54.36 --> 00:59:56.60
And they go real basic names first?

1426
00:59:56.60 --> 00:59:58.56
Cause I'm feeling a John or a Jim.

1427
00:59:58.56 --> 01:00:00.96
Yeah, yeah, but it would be even broader.

1428
01:00:00.96 --> 01:00:03.92
It's like, do you know anyone that's,

1429
01:00:03.92 --> 01:00:05.24
do you know anyone that's experienced trouble

1430
01:00:05.24 --> 01:00:06.36
in their life right now?

1431
01:00:06.36 --> 01:00:09.08
And if I see you like, that I'm like, wait,

1432
01:00:09.08 --> 01:00:10.88
are they sick?

1433
01:00:10.88 --> 01:00:11.72
You know what I mean?

1434
01:00:11.72 --> 01:00:13.12
And at the same time, my mind is awake.

1435
01:00:13.12 --> 01:00:13.96
Do I?

1436
01:00:13.96 --> 01:00:15.56
Then I search for everyone in my whole,

1437
01:00:15.56 --> 01:00:17.20
it's like, whether it's significant or not,

1438
01:00:17.20 --> 01:00:18.12
you kind of make it significant.

1439
01:00:18.12 --> 01:00:19.60
So it's like a dance going on.

1440
01:00:19.60 --> 01:00:22.16
Maybe we'll have a remote viewer on the program.

1441
01:00:22.16 --> 01:00:25.84
Cause the military had like a remote viewer group.

1442
01:00:26.84 --> 01:00:28.28
People that, that's what they did.

1443
01:00:28.28 --> 01:00:30.72
Sit in a room and go into a meditative state

1444
01:00:30.72 --> 01:00:35.24
and look for, you know, missile launch pads,

1445
01:00:35.24 --> 01:00:36.32
stuff like this.

1446
01:00:36.32 --> 01:00:39.84
I guess the argument for and against it,

1447
01:00:39.84 --> 01:00:41.88
in a matter of speaking, is kind of the same thing

1448
01:00:41.88 --> 01:00:43.72
where it's like, your brain is so complex.

1449
01:00:43.72 --> 01:00:45.96
And we, you know, there's a lot of stuff about your brain

1450
01:00:45.96 --> 01:00:48.68
and all this stuff that we don't know.

1451
01:00:48.68 --> 01:00:51.32
So it's possible, but at the same time,

1452
01:00:51.32 --> 01:00:53.16
it's kind of like, all right, well,

1453
01:00:53.16 --> 01:00:56.88
I don't see how your eyes can like see something

1454
01:00:56.88 --> 01:00:59.08
that they don't see and it's your brain, you know,

1455
01:00:59.08 --> 01:01:00.08
like it doesn't make sense.

1456
01:01:00.08 --> 01:01:01.76
Given what we do know, it doesn't make sense.

1457
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:03.48
Eddie Bravo has a podcast now

1458
01:01:03.48 --> 01:01:05.84
and it's called, Look Into It.

1459
01:01:05.84 --> 01:01:07.52
I think it's called Look Into It,

1460
01:01:07.52 --> 01:01:08.92
which is a freaking great name.

1461
01:01:08.92 --> 01:01:10.64
And this makes me think, you know,

1462
01:01:10.64 --> 01:01:12.88
maybe we need to get Eddie Bravo to look into it

1463
01:01:12.88 --> 01:01:15.60
and see what's up, see what's up with remote viewing.

1464
01:01:15.60 --> 01:01:17.52
Cause he's looking into a bunch of stuff.

1465
01:01:17.52 --> 01:01:20.20
Oh yeah. You know why it's called Look Into It?

1466
01:01:20.20 --> 01:01:21.40
I think it's cause of what I just said.

1467
01:01:21.40 --> 01:01:22.28
Is there another reason?

1468
01:01:22.28 --> 01:01:24.92
Yeah. Well, that's the thing that there was a,

1469
01:01:24.92 --> 01:01:26.12
Oh, is it a meme?

1470
01:01:26.12 --> 01:01:29.12
Kind of that he, he was on a podcast.

1471
01:01:29.12 --> 01:01:31.000
I forget which one it was, but it was one,

1472
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.36
you know, one of Joe Rogan's podcasts.

1473
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:34.64
He was on there and then they got into this heated

1474
01:01:34.64 --> 01:01:37.24
like argument about, you know,

1475
01:01:37.24 --> 01:01:39.64
one of the things that Eddie Bravo really kind of reports.

1476
01:01:39.64 --> 01:01:41.96
Maybe wasn't UFOs, what was it?

1477
01:01:41.96 --> 01:01:43.28
I don't know, 9-Eleven maybe.

1478
01:01:43.28 --> 01:01:44.12
I don't know.

1479
01:01:44.12 --> 01:01:46.68
I forget what it was, but he kept saying,

1480
01:01:46.68 --> 01:01:48.000
you just haven't looked into it.

1481
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.28
You just haven't looked into it kind of, you know what I mean?

1482
01:01:50.28 --> 01:01:52.36
That was kind of his defense to a lot of things.

1483
01:01:52.36 --> 01:01:55.20
But he said it so many times that like it became a thing.

1484
01:01:55.20 --> 01:01:57.52
Well, it's a great name for his podcast.

1485
01:01:57.52 --> 01:01:58.48
Cause I said, what are you doing?

1486
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:00.44
It's out there looking into it.

1487
01:02:00.44 --> 01:02:03.08
The weird thing about looking into things these days

1488
01:02:03.08 --> 01:02:04.80
is you can kind of find what you want to find.

1489
01:02:04.80 --> 01:02:05.64
Whatever you want.

1490
01:02:05.64 --> 01:02:06.68
Yeah, that's true.

1491
01:02:06.68 --> 01:02:10.12
There's all kinds of things to find what you want.

1492
01:02:10.12 --> 01:02:10.96
Yeah.

1493
01:02:10.96 --> 01:02:11.80
To find.

1494
01:02:11.80 --> 01:02:12.64
If you look into it.

1495
01:02:12.64 --> 01:02:13.48
If you look into it.

1496
01:02:13.48 --> 01:02:14.32
People enough.

1497
01:02:14.32 --> 01:02:15.16
Well, yeah.

1498
01:02:15.16 --> 01:02:17.52
And okay, so we have this trampoline.

1499
01:02:17.52 --> 01:02:19.48
It's called a rebounder.

1500
01:02:19.48 --> 01:02:21.72
It's like essentially like a regular little trampoline,

1501
01:02:21.72 --> 01:02:25.08
but it's like, I don't know, more robust.

1502
01:02:25.08 --> 01:02:26.08
I don't know, whatever.

1503
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:26.92
How big is it?

1504
01:02:26.92 --> 01:02:28.88
Like the regular size ones, like this table,

1505
01:02:28.88 --> 01:02:29.72
maybe a little bigger.

1506
01:02:29.72 --> 01:02:30.56
That's not a regular size.

1507
01:02:30.56 --> 01:02:31.60
So when I think trampoline,

1508
01:02:31.60 --> 01:02:34.92
I think of something that you, that is like 15 feet across.

1509
01:02:34.92 --> 01:02:35.76
Yeah.

1510
01:02:35.76 --> 01:02:36.80
Like a leg breaker.

1511
01:02:36.80 --> 01:02:37.64
Yeah.

1512
01:02:37.64 --> 01:02:40.60
But this thing is like one of those fitness trampolines

1513
01:02:40.60 --> 01:02:41.44
when you jump on it.

1514
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:42.28
Yeah, exactly.

1515
01:02:42.28 --> 01:02:44.40
But it's the one where it's like, there's no noise.

1516
01:02:44.40 --> 01:02:45.44
It's called a rebounder.

1517
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:46.56
If I'm not mistaken.

1518
01:02:46.56 --> 01:02:49.68
So anyway, one of the claims is that,

1519
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:52.40
oh yeah, it does something to your lymph system.

1520
01:02:52.40 --> 01:02:53.24
Okay.

1521
01:02:53.24 --> 01:02:55.88
Like it like does something to it.

1522
01:02:55.88 --> 01:02:57.000
Elevates it somehow.

1523
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.84
Makes it better.

1524
01:02:57.84 --> 01:02:58.68
Yeah.

1525
01:02:58.68 --> 01:03:00.48
You know, the pressure and here's the thing.

1526
01:03:00.48 --> 01:03:02.08
That could be a hundred percent true.

1527
01:03:02.08 --> 01:03:02.92
It could be.

1528
01:03:02.92 --> 01:03:03.76
Well, look into it.

1529
01:03:03.76 --> 01:03:04.72
Yeah, you look into it.

1530
01:03:04.72 --> 01:03:06.56
So I go and look in and you know, my wife,

1531
01:03:06.56 --> 01:03:08.56
she's like saying, yeah, my dad told me and this,

1532
01:03:08.56 --> 01:03:10.48
and he has one and let's face it.

1533
01:03:10.48 --> 01:03:11.52
The kids jump on it.

1534
01:03:11.52 --> 01:03:12.36
It's fun.

1535
01:03:12.36 --> 01:03:14.60
That's my main kind of catalyst or whatever.

1536
01:03:14.60 --> 01:03:15.64
You didn't even have to look into that.

1537
01:03:15.64 --> 01:03:16.48
Yep.

1538
01:03:16.48 --> 01:03:18.64
Then lymph or no lymph systems.

1539
01:03:18.64 --> 01:03:19.48
It's fun.

1540
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:20.64
The kids freaking love it and whatever.

1541
01:03:20.64 --> 01:03:22.52
It's good for your legs too, obviously.

1542
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.48
But I'm like, if I'm going to talk trash,

1543
01:03:26.48 --> 01:03:28.72
which I do just jokingly because I don't,

1544
01:03:28.72 --> 01:03:31.88
I don't know if it helps your lymph system or not.

1545
01:03:31.88 --> 01:03:32.72
If I'm going to talk trash,

1546
01:03:32.72 --> 01:03:34.32
I should at least look into it.

1547
01:03:34.32 --> 01:03:36.76
So I looked into it and sure enough,

1548
01:03:36.76 --> 01:03:38.72
it says, yeah, it does this, your lymph system,

1549
01:03:38.72 --> 01:03:41.84
but then just like what you're eluding to

1550
01:03:41.84 --> 01:03:44.76
where you kind of got to consider the source, you know?

1551
01:03:44.76 --> 01:03:47.12
And then, oh, what, what I'm gonna spend my day

1552
01:03:47.12 --> 01:03:49.96
looking into this five websites that said this.

1553
01:03:49.96 --> 01:03:51.28
Now I got to determine the credibility.

1554
01:03:51.28 --> 01:03:52.44
So it's like hard, you know?

1555
01:03:52.44 --> 01:03:53.28
Yeah.

1556
01:03:53.28 --> 01:03:54.12
There's all kinds of credit.

1557
01:03:54.12 --> 01:03:56.24
Cause you can make a website that has,

1558
01:03:56.24 --> 01:03:58.36
oh, click here for the supporting documentation,

1559
01:03:58.36 --> 01:04:01.24
but you also wrote the supporting documentation, right?

1560
01:04:01.24 --> 01:04:03.28
So even when you're looking into it,

1561
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:05.32
you're not looking in the right place.

1562
01:04:05.32 --> 01:04:07.20
Yeah, it's true, man.

1563
01:04:07.20 --> 01:04:08.04
Holy cow.

1564
01:04:09.32 --> 01:04:12.56
What platform is Eddie Bravo's?

1565
01:04:12.56 --> 01:04:14.32
Do you know what, it's on a platform.

1566
01:04:14.32 --> 01:04:16.44
I don't know if it's on an open platform.

1567
01:04:16.44 --> 01:04:17.40
Oh, I don't know.

1568
01:04:17.40 --> 01:04:18.24
I have to look into it.

1569
01:04:18.24 --> 01:04:20.20
I got to look into it.

1570
01:04:20.20 --> 01:04:21.56
So there you go.

1571
01:04:23.08 --> 01:04:24.44
Perspective.

1572
01:04:24.44 --> 01:04:27.52
You got to look into some other people's perspectives

1573
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:31.84
and figure out what the whole target,

1574
01:04:31.84 --> 01:04:33.72
what the whole problem looks like.

1575
01:04:33.72 --> 01:04:34.64
So there you go.

1576
01:04:34.64 --> 01:04:35.84
Perspective.

1577
01:04:35.84 --> 01:04:37.04
Spend some time.

1578
01:04:37.04 --> 01:04:38.88
Put that on your checklist.

1579
01:04:38.88 --> 01:04:40.76
The perspective you have, by the way,

1580
01:04:40.76 --> 01:04:41.88
is not the whole thing.

1581
01:04:41.88 --> 01:04:43.16
And there's a good chance that your perspective

1582
01:04:43.16 --> 01:04:44.76
is actually wrong, right?

1583
01:04:44.76 --> 01:04:46.56
Hey, I don't see any enemy on this target.

1584
01:04:46.56 --> 01:04:48.48
All you need to do is go 90 degrees in the other direction.

1585
01:04:48.48 --> 01:04:51.16
You can see a bunch of enemies sitting behind a building.

1586
01:04:52.40 --> 01:04:55.36
Hey, make your bias that your perspective

1587
01:04:55.36 --> 01:04:56.68
is probably a little bit off.

1588
01:04:56.68 --> 01:04:59.40
Maybe even make your bias that you're wrong.

1589
01:04:59.40 --> 01:05:02.92
That what you see is not the whole picture.

1590
01:05:02.92 --> 01:05:05.72
That what you see is actually a bad picture.

1591
01:05:05.72 --> 01:05:07.72
That's what I think of my perspective.

1592
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.24
I think, you know what?

1593
01:05:10.24 --> 01:05:11.08
This is what I see.

1594
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:14.12
And I know my gut instinct is like,

1595
01:05:14.12 --> 01:05:16.44
I know I don't not see everything.

1596
01:05:16.44 --> 01:05:17.44
And there's more to the picture

1597
01:05:17.44 --> 01:05:19.08
and I need to figure out what that is.

1598
01:05:19.08 --> 01:05:21.04
Make that part of your checklist.

1599
01:05:21.04 --> 01:05:26.04
Next thing is mission.

1600
01:05:27.04 --> 01:05:31.64
So is the decision that you're about to make,

1601
01:05:31.64 --> 01:05:32.76
does it support the mission

1602
01:05:32.76 --> 01:05:36.24
that you're actually trying to execute on?

1603
01:05:36.24 --> 01:05:38.72
And not actually more important than that,

1604
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:42.84
does it support your overall strategic mission?

1605
01:05:43.96 --> 01:05:47.12
And this causes all kinds of, there's a term out there.

1606
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:48.72
Have you heard term mission creep?

1607
01:05:48.72 --> 01:05:49.56
Yeah.

1608
01:05:49.56 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah, it's a pretty common term now.

1609
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.40
This is because people don't run this leadership loop

1610
01:05:53.40 --> 01:05:55.32
in their brain and they don't ask themselves,

1611
01:05:55.32 --> 01:05:56.60
hold on a second, what's our mission?

1612
01:05:56.60 --> 01:05:57.84
What's our overall mission?

1613
01:05:57.84 --> 01:05:59.04
And is this in support of it?

1614
01:05:59.04 --> 01:05:59.88
If I make this decision,

1615
01:05:59.88 --> 01:06:02.72
it's gonna help us reach our strategic goals.

1616
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:05.44
All kinds of people make that mistake.

1617
01:06:05.44 --> 01:06:07.000
And we can't allow for that.

1618
01:06:07.84 --> 01:06:10.80
So what you do is you just run a quick check and say,

1619
01:06:10.80 --> 01:06:13.08
hold on, does this support the tactical mission

1620
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:14.16
that we're trying to execute?

1621
01:06:14.16 --> 01:06:17.20
Does this support the strategic mission

1622
01:06:17.20 --> 01:06:18.36
that we're trying to achieve?

1623
01:06:18.36 --> 01:06:21.12
And if it doesn't, you know it's a bad decision.

1624
01:06:22.80 --> 01:06:24.88
Next one, leadership capital.

1625
01:06:27.12 --> 01:06:29.52
And this is one that I recently added to this list.

1626
01:06:29.52 --> 01:06:31.84
And the reason that I added to the list

1627
01:06:31.84 --> 01:06:35.000
is because at some point I was having a discussion

1628
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.76
with somebody and I realized, actually,

1629
01:06:38.76 --> 01:06:41.92
let me rephrase this, I was making a decision

1630
01:06:41.92 --> 01:06:46.04
and I realized that the main thing that I was calculating

1631
01:06:46.04 --> 01:06:47.64
was how much this was gonna cost me

1632
01:06:47.64 --> 01:06:49.44
from a leadership capital perspective.

1633
01:06:50.32 --> 01:06:53.80
And so first of all, what is leadership capital?

1634
01:06:53.80 --> 01:06:55.24
Leadership capital is the fact

1635
01:06:55.24 --> 01:06:59.80
that you can only get people to do so much.

1636
01:07:01.20 --> 01:07:03.52
As a leader, you can only get people to do so much.

1637
01:07:05.52 --> 01:07:08.20
When you ask somebody to do something, it costs.

1638
01:07:09.44 --> 01:07:13.16
It costs you leadership capital.

1639
01:07:13.16 --> 01:07:17.88
And if they don't wanna do it, it costs more.

1640
01:07:17.88 --> 01:07:20.68
And if they wanna do it, then it costs less.

1641
01:07:21.84 --> 01:07:24.24
And if they do it on their own accord,

1642
01:07:24.24 --> 01:07:26.40
then it's very cheap, maybe even free.

1643
01:07:26.40 --> 01:07:27.72
And if you let them do what they want,

1644
01:07:27.72 --> 01:07:30.84
you're kinda collecting some leadership capital.

1645
01:07:30.84 --> 01:07:34.88
So just the very, any interaction that I have

1646
01:07:34.88 --> 01:07:39.56
with Echo Charles, if I say, hey, get this done.

1647
01:07:39.56 --> 01:07:43.96
Hey, do this, hey, make a video about this.

1648
01:07:43.96 --> 01:07:45.52
That cost me leadership capital.

1649
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:46.92
Cost me leadership capital.

1650
01:07:48.24 --> 01:07:50.08
Especially if you don't wanna do it.

1651
01:07:51.04 --> 01:07:52.36
It's costing me even more.

1652
01:07:52.36 --> 01:07:54.16
Now look, I might have some leadership capital with you

1653
01:07:54.16 --> 01:07:55.88
and you're like, all right, fine, I'll do it.

1654
01:07:55.88 --> 01:07:59.04
If you wanna do it, if I'm like,

1655
01:07:59.04 --> 01:08:01.64
hey, make a video with robots exploding,

1656
01:08:01.64 --> 01:08:03.40
you're like, oh, hell yeah.

1657
01:08:03.40 --> 01:08:04.92
It didn't cost me very much.

1658
01:08:05.84 --> 01:08:09.08
Now if I say to you, man, I wish we had more videos

1659
01:08:09.08 --> 01:08:11.08
with robots exploding, you were like, dude,

1660
01:08:11.08 --> 01:08:13.16
I'm gonna make a sick one.

1661
01:08:13.16 --> 01:08:14.36
That's very cheap.

1662
01:08:15.52 --> 01:08:18.44
You're still working, so maybe it cost me a little something.

1663
01:08:18.44 --> 01:08:22.12
But if I say, hey man, I have no idea what to do,

1664
01:08:22.12 --> 01:08:23.40
what do you think we should do?

1665
01:08:23.40 --> 01:08:24.68
And you're like, we need to make a video

1666
01:08:24.68 --> 01:08:25.88
with robots exploding.

1667
01:08:25.88 --> 01:08:27.64
I go, that's awesome.

1668
01:08:27.64 --> 01:08:30.60
I actually gained some leadership capital.

1669
01:08:30.60 --> 01:08:33.68
So everything, when people are interacting with you,

1670
01:08:33.68 --> 01:08:35.88
are there's gonna be leadership capital spent?

1671
01:08:35.88 --> 01:08:40.88
And by the way, every interaction that I have with you,

1672
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.92
never mind just a task, but when we interact with each other,

1673
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:48.40
there's leadership capital being exchanged.

1674
01:08:49.52 --> 01:08:52.64
And we as people always think we have

1675
01:08:52.64 --> 01:08:56.32
more leadership capital than we do.

1676
01:08:57.84 --> 01:08:59.64
Here's a couple of things that will throw you for a loop.

1677
01:08:59.64 --> 01:09:02.32
You think rank gives you a bunch of leadership capital?

1678
01:09:02.32 --> 01:09:03.16
It doesn't.

1679
01:09:03.16 --> 01:09:04.24
It doesn't.

1680
01:09:04.24 --> 01:09:07.56
Rank, it gives you a little tiny bit.

1681
01:09:07.56 --> 01:09:09.80
Because hey man, obviously I'm in this position

1682
01:09:09.80 --> 01:09:11.84
and you haven't been here as long as me

1683
01:09:11.84 --> 01:09:13.64
and I've done this stuff before.

1684
01:09:13.64 --> 01:09:15.60
So there's an element of leadership capital

1685
01:09:15.60 --> 01:09:16.64
that comes with rank.

1686
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:20.76
But it's not as much as we think.

1687
01:09:20.76 --> 01:09:23.16
Actually when I give ownership to someone,

1688
01:09:23.16 --> 01:09:25.16
when I say, hey Echo, you go ahead and run this project

1689
01:09:25.16 --> 01:09:26.16
the way you want.

1690
01:09:26.16 --> 01:09:28.16
You seem to have a good grasp on it.

1691
01:09:28.16 --> 01:09:29.64
That actually earns me leadership capital.

1692
01:09:29.64 --> 01:09:33.08
So giving ownership earns leadership capital.

1693
01:09:33.08 --> 01:09:36.000
Listening to someone as simple as that might sound

1694
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.56
gives me leadership capital.

1695
01:09:38.56 --> 01:09:39.40
When you come to me and say,

1696
01:09:39.40 --> 01:09:40.40
I want to talk to you about something,

1697
01:09:40.40 --> 01:09:42.96
I go, oh, I get out my notebook

1698
01:09:42.96 --> 01:09:43.96
and I say, hey, tell me what you got.

1699
01:09:43.96 --> 01:09:45.56
You're like, I have this idea of doing this

1700
01:09:45.56 --> 01:09:46.56
and I'm writing it down.

1701
01:09:46.56 --> 01:09:47.96
That gives me leadership capital.

1702
01:09:49.96 --> 01:09:52.60
You could do like a little, whether it be fresh on front

1703
01:09:52.60 --> 01:09:55.36
or whatever, you could do like a fun little quiz.

1704
01:09:55.36 --> 01:09:58.16
And it's like leadership capital quiz.

1705
01:09:58.16 --> 01:10:00.60
Is this spending it or earning it?

1706
01:10:00.60 --> 01:10:01.56
And you could do little things.

1707
01:10:01.56 --> 01:10:03.84
You could probably go pretty deep with that.

1708
01:10:03.84 --> 01:10:04.68
You can go real deep.

1709
01:10:04.68 --> 01:10:06.56
I've covered that in the academy.

1710
01:10:06.56 --> 01:10:09.000
How to earn leadership capital.

1711
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.40
And what costs leadership capital.

1712
01:10:11.40 --> 01:10:14.12
So you definitely, that's good.

1713
01:10:14.12 --> 01:10:16.32
We could do it on here at some point as well.

1714
01:10:18.64 --> 01:10:21.32
It's surprising how much listening to people

1715
01:10:21.32 --> 01:10:22.32
gives you leadership capital.

1716
01:10:22.32 --> 01:10:26.60
And usually when I talk about the opposite of that

1717
01:10:26.60 --> 01:10:28.48
is when people go, oh yeah, he's right.

1718
01:10:28.48 --> 01:10:30.24
Cause listen, if you start telling me something

1719
01:10:30.24 --> 01:10:33.24
and I cut you off, right?

1720
01:10:33.24 --> 01:10:36.76
And you might not realize the weight of when you're

1721
01:10:36.76 --> 01:10:38.24
telling me something and I listen to you.

1722
01:10:38.24 --> 01:10:39.08
You might not.

1723
01:10:39.08 --> 01:10:40.08
It's like a subconscious.

1724
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:42.52
You be some consciously giving me leadership capital.

1725
01:10:42.52 --> 01:10:44.36
Some conscious like, oh yeah, hell yeah.

1726
01:10:44.36 --> 01:10:47.36
But when I cut you off and you're trying to express

1727
01:10:47.36 --> 01:10:48.64
something to me and I just cut you off.

1728
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:50.32
And I'm like, yeah, hey look,

1729
01:10:50.32 --> 01:10:51.92
let's get to the topic of the day.

1730
01:10:51.92 --> 01:10:54.96
You're just, that costs me a lot of leadership capital.

1731
01:10:54.96 --> 01:10:59.24
Just like anything, and that's just do with respect.

1732
01:10:59.24 --> 01:11:02.04
You know what you were talking about earlier?

1733
01:11:02.04 --> 01:11:03.96
A crappy job.

1734
01:11:03.96 --> 01:11:07.08
If we got something, if we gotta go pick up brass

1735
01:11:07.08 --> 01:11:09.44
and I'm out there doing it with you,

1736
01:11:09.44 --> 01:11:10.64
leadership capital goes up.

1737
01:11:10.64 --> 01:11:12.68
If I'm in the air conditioning place,

1738
01:11:12.68 --> 01:11:13.84
leadership capital goes down.

1739
01:11:13.84 --> 01:11:17.60
So there's all these things that are going on.

1740
01:11:19.08 --> 01:11:20.96
Bro, it gets kind of tricky too though.

1741
01:11:20.96 --> 01:11:24.76
And maybe it's my little P brain mind going too deep

1742
01:11:24.76 --> 01:11:26.64
into it, maybe it's not.

1743
01:11:26.64 --> 01:11:28.56
But like, let's say you, okay,

1744
01:11:28.56 --> 01:11:29.68
you know your story, right?

1745
01:11:29.68 --> 01:11:31.000
The patches, right?

1746
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.20
So you let, we'll say, you let something slide, right?

1747
01:11:35.36 --> 01:11:37.48
You let something slide, sometimes that can,

1748
01:11:37.48 --> 01:11:40.12
under certain circumstances that can gain you,

1749
01:11:40.12 --> 01:11:42.04
may have you gain leadership capital,

1750
01:11:42.04 --> 01:11:44.76
but under other circumstances you can lose it.

1751
01:11:44.76 --> 01:11:45.84
It's the same action.

1752
01:11:45.84 --> 01:11:47.32
You let something slide.

1753
01:11:47.32 --> 01:11:49.20
But it's like, oh, you gotta understand.

1754
01:11:49.20 --> 01:11:51.48
That's why you wrote the dichotomy of leadership.

1755
01:11:51.48 --> 01:11:52.64
That's why a quiz would be pretty good.

1756
01:11:52.64 --> 01:11:55.08
And that's why leadership is tricky.

1757
01:11:55.08 --> 01:11:57.76
It's tricky because you gotta assess that.

1758
01:11:57.76 --> 01:12:01.48
And that's why I'm talking about this leadership loop.

1759
01:12:01.48 --> 01:12:04.08
Because so often people aren't actually just checking them.

1760
01:12:04.08 --> 01:12:05.08
So I was like, wait a second,

1761
01:12:05.08 --> 01:12:06.64
I wonder how bad Echo actually wants to do this.

1762
01:12:06.64 --> 01:12:08.20
I wonder what this is costing me.

1763
01:12:11.60 --> 01:12:14.88
The reason that it weighs so heavily for me,

1764
01:12:14.88 --> 01:12:16.28
first of all, it's because leadership capital

1765
01:12:16.28 --> 01:12:17.48
is the currency of winning.

1766
01:12:17.48 --> 01:12:20.72
If you wanna win, you gotta have a bunch of leadership

1767
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:23.16
capital built up.

1768
01:12:23.16 --> 01:12:27.44
And I put so much weight on leadership capital

1769
01:12:28.76 --> 01:12:32.60
because this is interesting thing to think about.

1770
01:12:32.60 --> 01:12:33.96
Most of the time,

1771
01:12:35.28 --> 01:12:39.40
one idea, it's only a little bit better

1772
01:12:39.40 --> 01:12:40.68
than some other idea.

1773
01:12:41.64 --> 01:12:45.32
Very rarely are you and I working at a company

1774
01:12:45.32 --> 01:12:48.60
or in a military unit or part of a team.

1775
01:12:48.60 --> 01:12:53.32
And your idea is so radically different from mine

1776
01:12:54.56 --> 01:12:59.20
that I'm willing to, that I even need to think about,

1777
01:12:59.20 --> 01:13:01.24
hey, is that a good decision or not?

1778
01:13:01.24 --> 01:13:04.80
Usually your idea is pretty good.

1779
01:13:04.80 --> 01:13:06.24
You're like, in your mind, you're like,

1780
01:13:06.24 --> 01:13:09.80
hey, I wanna explode a Star Wars robots.

1781
01:13:09.80 --> 01:13:12.08
And I think you should explode.

1782
01:13:12.08 --> 01:13:12.92
Terminator.

1783
01:13:12.92 --> 01:13:14.80
Terminator robots, right?

1784
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:19.000
Are those two things worth arguing about?

1785
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:19.88
No, no.

1786
01:13:19.88 --> 01:13:20.96
Are they worth it?

1787
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:22.16
They're not.

1788
01:13:22.16 --> 01:13:24.24
I think one thing, you think another thing,

1789
01:13:24.24 --> 01:13:25.40
but the things that we're thinking

1790
01:13:25.40 --> 01:13:26.72
are very closely related.

1791
01:13:26.72 --> 01:13:29.60
So therefore, what trumps the idea,

1792
01:13:29.60 --> 01:13:31.68
because the ideas are so close,

1793
01:13:33.08 --> 01:13:34.68
what trumps the idea is leadership capital.

1794
01:13:34.68 --> 01:13:35.84
We have a common goal.

1795
01:13:35.84 --> 01:13:38.28
We have a common capability.

1796
01:13:38.28 --> 01:13:40.44
We have common experiences.

1797
01:13:40.44 --> 01:13:42.84
And we're gonna come up with pretty similar plans

1798
01:13:42.84 --> 01:13:44.88
because we're both coming from the same place.

1799
01:13:44.88 --> 01:13:48.76
Therefore, your plan is probably gonna be viable.

1800
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:50.76
And because your plan is viable,

1801
01:13:50.76 --> 01:13:53.28
because what I said, you want Star Wars?

1802
01:13:53.28 --> 01:13:54.12
Terminator.

1803
01:13:54.12 --> 01:13:55.64
Okay, because you want Terminator robots

1804
01:13:55.64 --> 01:13:58.92
and I want Star Wars robots, they're both viable.

1805
01:13:58.92 --> 01:14:00.96
But because they're both viable,

1806
01:14:00.96 --> 01:14:03.96
I make the expenditure of leadership capital

1807
01:14:03.96 --> 01:14:07.72
a very heavy weighted element of my decision.

1808
01:14:09.36 --> 01:14:11.44
Because the decision between Star Wars robots

1809
01:14:11.44 --> 01:14:14.88
or Terminator robots isn't gonna make that much of a difference.

1810
01:14:14.88 --> 01:14:17.64
Now, are there people that freaking dig in

1811
01:14:17.64 --> 01:14:19.80
about what robot needs to die?

1812
01:14:19.80 --> 01:14:20.84
Hell yeah, there are.

1813
01:14:20.84 --> 01:14:22.72
And they're idiots for doing it.

1814
01:14:22.72 --> 01:14:24.04
I don't care.

1815
01:14:25.04 --> 01:14:26.20
I don't care.

1816
01:14:27.08 --> 01:14:28.12
And the reason I don't care is

1817
01:14:28.12 --> 01:14:32.08
because building leadership capital is the strategic move.

1818
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:34.000
That's the strategic move,

1819
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.08
because if we're spending leadership capital all the time,

1820
01:14:37.08 --> 01:14:38.08
we won't have any left,

1821
01:14:38.08 --> 01:14:40.12
or even worse, we'll end up in debt.

1822
01:14:40.12 --> 01:14:41.60
And that's not gonna end well.

1823
01:14:41.60 --> 01:14:42.44
Because by the way,

1824
01:14:42.44 --> 01:14:43.68
when I don't have any leadership capital with you

1825
01:14:43.68 --> 01:14:45.12
and I ask you to do something,

1826
01:14:45.12 --> 01:14:46.20
you're not gonna do it.

1827
01:14:47.36 --> 01:14:49.32
If I have a ton of leadership capital

1828
01:14:49.32 --> 01:14:51.12
and I need you to do something,

1829
01:14:52.08 --> 01:14:53.60
and there's no time to talk about it,

1830
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:54.52
and you don't believe in it,

1831
01:14:54.52 --> 01:14:55.84
but I need to get it done,

1832
01:14:55.84 --> 01:14:58.000
I can actually spend some of that leadership capital

1833
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.16
and we can move forward.

1834
01:15:00.04 --> 01:15:04.44
So, that's what I'm gonna do.

1835
01:15:04.44 --> 01:15:08.76
When I'm making a decision as to whether or not

1836
01:15:08.76 --> 01:15:10.96
to go left or right, or use Terminator robots

1837
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:12.52
or Star Wars robots,

1838
01:15:13.44 --> 01:15:15.56
I'm going to put a huge amount of weight

1839
01:15:15.56 --> 01:15:19.52
on how much leadership capital this is going to cost me.

1840
01:15:19.52 --> 01:15:23.92
And see and weigh whether this is,

1841
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:27.44
whether this is the right move or not.

1842
01:15:27.44 --> 01:15:30.36
Most of the time, it's not.

1843
01:15:30.36 --> 01:15:32.36
Most of the time, it's not.

1844
01:15:32.36 --> 01:15:36.28
Leadership capital is more valuable

1845
01:15:36.28 --> 01:15:40.48
than any other elements in the world.

1846
01:15:42.04 --> 01:15:45.24
Leadership capital, everything that's wrapped up

1847
01:15:45.24 --> 01:15:50.24
in leadership capital, trust, integrity, vision, unity.

1848
01:15:51.32 --> 01:15:54.16
There's all these things that are wrapped up in it.

1849
01:15:54.16 --> 01:15:55.32
That's what makes it so valuable.

1850
01:15:55.32 --> 01:15:59.84
It's like this thing that has so much power.

1851
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:01.44
And yet people throw it away.

1852
01:16:01.44 --> 01:16:02.64
People don't even realize how valuable it is.

1853
01:16:02.64 --> 01:16:04.60
I'll just throw it away on this, that, or the other thing.

1854
01:16:04.60 --> 01:16:06.08
Like, hey, you just need to get this done.

1855
01:16:06.08 --> 01:16:09.36
Boom, I just spent freaking however many units

1856
01:16:09.36 --> 01:16:11.000
worth of leadership capital.

1857
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.92
Dude, you just need to be quiet and get this done.

1858
01:16:12.92 --> 01:16:14.92
Boom, I'm just throwing money away.

1859
01:16:14.92 --> 01:16:16.16
Hey, hey, Jocko, I gotta go to,

1860
01:16:16.16 --> 01:16:18.08
hey, look, I don't need to hear your ideas right now.

1861
01:16:18.08 --> 01:16:18.92
We need to move forward.

1862
01:16:18.92 --> 01:16:20.04
Okay, cool, that just cost me.

1863
01:16:20.04 --> 01:16:21.48
It's like everything we do.

1864
01:16:21.48 --> 01:16:23.40
People just throw it away like it's nothing.

1865
01:16:23.40 --> 01:16:25.56
They break out the freaking, they go into debt.

1866
01:16:25.56 --> 01:16:28.08
They go into, then they end up bankrupt.

1867
01:16:28.08 --> 01:16:28.92
Leadership.

1868
01:16:28.92 --> 01:16:31.20
You ever met someone that has no leadership capital left?

1869
01:16:31.20 --> 01:16:32.04
Yes, I have.

1870
01:16:32.04 --> 01:16:33.76
Yeah, like you work for someone that's an asshole.

1871
01:16:33.76 --> 01:16:35.28
You work for someone that doesn't listen to anybody else.

1872
01:16:35.28 --> 01:16:36.80
They have no leadership capital.

1873
01:16:36.80 --> 01:16:40.08
And maybe they can make some things happen early on

1874
01:16:40.08 --> 01:16:42.44
because they have the authority or they have the experience

1875
01:16:42.44 --> 01:16:44.08
or they have the position.

1876
01:16:44.08 --> 01:16:46.08
And that, they can actually make a little bit of progress

1877
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:47.04
and then the leadership capital's gone

1878
01:16:47.04 --> 01:16:48.08
and everything just falls apart.

1879
01:16:48.08 --> 01:16:50.86
Yeah, and that's like a, back,

1880
01:16:50.86 --> 01:16:53.32
and I've said this before, so I don't need to go too deep

1881
01:16:53.32 --> 01:16:55.60
into it, but you know how like you have an old boss

1882
01:16:55.60 --> 01:16:57.52
that you used to work for and he was just a dick

1883
01:16:57.52 --> 01:16:58.84
or whatever and he don't work there anymore.

1884
01:16:58.84 --> 01:17:00.96
You work at a better job now, you know?

1885
01:17:00.96 --> 01:17:03.28
And then maybe you see that old boss somewhere,

1886
01:17:03.28 --> 01:17:05.40
the way you feel about him.

1887
01:17:05.40 --> 01:17:07.88
You can see his leadership capital is at zero

1888
01:17:07.88 --> 01:17:09.22
at that point.

1889
01:17:09.22 --> 01:17:10.06
At zero.

1890
01:17:11.08 --> 01:17:11.96
So that's what I'm gonna do.

1891
01:17:11.96 --> 01:17:13.88
I'm gonna consider leadership capital

1892
01:17:13.88 --> 01:17:16.20
and it's gonna weigh very heavily.

1893
01:17:16.20 --> 01:17:18.08
And by the way, the reason I didn't put this

1894
01:17:18.08 --> 01:17:20.80
on the list originally, because it was so,

1895
01:17:20.80 --> 01:17:22.72
it was so integral to the way I think

1896
01:17:22.72 --> 01:17:23.56
I didn't even see it there.

1897
01:17:23.56 --> 01:17:24.40
You know what I mean?

1898
01:17:24.40 --> 01:17:25.22
It was just one of those things.

1899
01:17:25.22 --> 01:17:27.36
It was almost like, if I was to put down,

1900
01:17:27.36 --> 01:17:28.78
what do you need every day, Echo?

1901
01:17:28.78 --> 01:17:30.96
You'd be like, hey, I need a good workout.

1902
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:33.60
I need to get a good steak.

1903
01:17:33.60 --> 01:17:35.40
I wanna roll a jiu-jitsu.

1904
01:17:35.40 --> 01:17:36.68
And I'd be like, what about oxygen?

1905
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:37.60
What about air?

1906
01:17:37.60 --> 01:17:38.44
You'd be like, well, yeah, obviously.

1907
01:17:38.44 --> 01:17:41.44
That's, leadership capital for me was like breathing air.

1908
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:42.80
It was that integral to my day.

1909
01:17:42.80 --> 01:17:43.88
I didn't even see it was there.

1910
01:17:43.88 --> 01:17:44.72
Yeah.

1911
01:17:44.72 --> 01:17:45.56
So.

1912
01:17:45.56 --> 01:17:46.52
Yeah, now that you bring it up though,

1913
01:17:46.52 --> 01:17:48.56
it's like, it's not like air, right?

1914
01:17:48.56 --> 01:17:51.08
Cause it's so like people don't understand.

1915
01:17:51.08 --> 01:17:52.44
Oh no, actually wrong.

1916
01:17:52.44 --> 01:17:53.28
It is like air.

1917
01:17:53.28 --> 01:17:54.64
Or it is, but they're ignoring it.

1918
01:17:54.64 --> 01:17:55.48
So it's like that.

1919
01:17:55.48 --> 01:17:56.80
Well, it is, but people don't realize

1920
01:17:56.80 --> 01:17:59.52
how valuable it is they can't breathe.

1921
01:17:59.52 --> 01:18:00.92
So they don't even realize it's there.

1922
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:02.44
And they're like just wasting it

1923
01:18:02.44 --> 01:18:03.56
and it doesn't matter.

1924
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:04.40
It'll always be there.

1925
01:18:04.40 --> 01:18:05.64
No, it's not.

1926
01:18:05.64 --> 01:18:07.16
You get choked out.

1927
01:18:07.16 --> 01:18:08.20
So what happens?

1928
01:18:08.20 --> 01:18:09.48
Tell me you're not concerned about air

1929
01:18:09.48 --> 01:18:12.16
when you get that guillotine choke sunk on you.

1930
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:13.12
I am concerned about air.

1931
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:14.44
Yeah, real concerned.

1932
01:18:14.44 --> 01:18:15.28
Yes.

1933
01:18:15.28 --> 01:18:16.16
So be careful.

1934
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:18.64
Tell me if you think this is an example

1935
01:18:18.64 --> 01:18:22.08
of being in touch with leadership capital.

1936
01:18:23.64 --> 01:18:25.68
So, you know, as you know, we have this dog now,

1937
01:18:25.68 --> 01:18:26.52
a small dog.

1938
01:18:26.52 --> 01:18:27.36
Never wanted a dog.

1939
01:18:27.36 --> 01:18:28.20
I didn't want a dog.

1940
01:18:28.20 --> 01:18:29.28
What's your dog's name?

1941
01:18:29.28 --> 01:18:30.12
Maya.

1942
01:18:30.12 --> 01:18:31.76
It's a small little we what do you call it?

1943
01:18:31.76 --> 01:18:33.000
Yorkie.

1944
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:33.84
I think I don't know what you call it.

1945
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:34.68
Cause I don't have the dog.

1946
01:18:34.68 --> 01:18:35.52
Come on, bro.

1947
01:18:35.52 --> 01:18:36.36
You know what it's called.

1948
01:18:36.36 --> 01:18:38.08
Anyway, one of these little small dogs, whatever.

1949
01:18:38.08 --> 01:18:38.92
It's whatever.

1950
01:18:38.92 --> 01:18:39.76
It's cute.

1951
01:18:39.76 --> 01:18:40.76
I never wanted the dog.

1952
01:18:40.76 --> 01:18:44.76
We're going to add another thing to the like simple life.

1953
01:18:45.80 --> 01:18:46.88
All the kids want dogs.

1954
01:18:46.88 --> 01:18:48.88
My wife, maybe, maybe she wanted the dog.

1955
01:18:48.88 --> 01:18:51.16
Maybe not, but she hears it from the kids every day.

1956
01:18:51.16 --> 01:18:52.000
Oh my gosh.

1957
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.24
Every time the kids see a dog.

1958
01:18:54.24 --> 01:18:55.52
And there's people in our neighborhood,

1959
01:18:55.52 --> 01:18:57.32
neighborhood with cool little dogs and stuff.

1960
01:18:57.32 --> 01:18:58.16
And they're nice dogs.

1961
01:18:58.16 --> 01:19:00.96
And so they're great examples of dogs all around

1962
01:19:00.96 --> 01:19:03.52
constantly being reminded how they don't have a dog.

1963
01:19:03.52 --> 01:19:04.52
Right.

1964
01:19:04.52 --> 01:19:06.08
So finally I'm like, hey, all right.

1965
01:19:06.08 --> 01:19:08.000
I kind of went through this loop a little bit

1966
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.12
in a small way where I'm like, hey, you know, like

1967
01:19:10.12 --> 01:19:11.60
leadership capital at some point in there.

1968
01:19:11.60 --> 01:19:12.44
Exactly. Right.

1969
01:19:12.44 --> 01:19:13.28
So I'm like, all right.

1970
01:19:13.28 --> 01:19:16.68
Now, this would be actually be an interesting thing

1971
01:19:16.68 --> 01:19:19.12
for us to do is go through your decision to get a dog

1972
01:19:19.12 --> 01:19:23.76
and assess your leadership loop on this thing.

1973
01:19:23.76 --> 01:19:24.60
Right.

1974
01:19:24.60 --> 01:19:26.72
I mean, you know, time, well, you do have plenty of time

1975
01:19:26.72 --> 01:19:27.56
to make this decision.

1976
01:19:27.56 --> 01:19:28.80
You didn't like rush one week and be like,

1977
01:19:28.80 --> 01:19:29.68
okay, we need to get a dog now.

1978
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:31.32
I know you took time to consider it.

1979
01:19:31.32 --> 01:19:32.16
Two years by the way.

1980
01:19:32.16 --> 01:19:33.24
So there you go.

1981
01:19:33.24 --> 01:19:34.52
Cover move.

1982
01:19:34.52 --> 01:19:37.92
You were like, hey, if we don't get a dog,

1983
01:19:37.92 --> 01:19:39.40
is that putting me first?

1984
01:19:39.40 --> 01:19:40.24
Yes, it is.

1985
01:19:40.24 --> 01:19:41.52
And so you kind of made that decision.

1986
01:19:41.52 --> 01:19:43.60
Like, okay, gotta put the team first.

1987
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:44.68
Simple.

1988
01:19:44.68 --> 01:19:45.96
This is one of those things where you're like,

1989
01:19:45.96 --> 01:19:48.76
well, this is going to actually make things more complex.

1990
01:19:48.76 --> 01:19:50.96
So you had to put that into the calculus.

1991
01:19:50.96 --> 01:19:51.80
Right.

1992
01:19:51.80 --> 01:19:52.88
Prioritize and execute.

1993
01:19:52.88 --> 01:19:54.60
Well, is it one of our priorities?

1994
01:19:54.60 --> 01:19:59.60
Well, we saw some family unity being created.

1995
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.24
And so that was a positive thing.

1996
01:20:01.24 --> 01:20:03.20
So the priority kind of stepped up a little bit

1997
01:20:03.20 --> 01:20:04.76
because we want the family to be tight.

1998
01:20:04.76 --> 01:20:06.84
And yeah, and there's other elements in that too,

1999
01:20:06.84 --> 01:20:09.80
because, you know, like, okay, so my daughter's nine.

2000
01:20:09.80 --> 01:20:11.24
So getting a small dog too.

2001
01:20:11.24 --> 01:20:13.12
This is like a small, it's not like some big great Dane

2002
01:20:13.12 --> 01:20:14.48
where it's like more responsibility

2003
01:20:14.48 --> 01:20:16.68
or whatever it's a small little dog, minimal,

2004
01:20:16.68 --> 01:20:19.28
arguably responsibility comparatively speaking.

2005
01:20:19.28 --> 01:20:22.68
And you have a pet that it actually is responsibility

2006
01:20:22.68 --> 01:20:25.84
for the kid obviously being supported by us, of course,

2007
01:20:25.84 --> 01:20:27.80
you know, but you get to learn a little bit

2008
01:20:27.80 --> 01:20:30.56
of that responsibility, sacrifice, you know,

2009
01:20:30.56 --> 01:20:31.56
and stuff like that.

2010
01:20:31.56 --> 01:20:33.88
So it was a net pot as far as priorities go

2011
01:20:33.88 --> 01:20:36.28
and the developmental elements of a kid.

2012
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:37.48
And let's face it, like,

2013
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:43.08
is it unreasonable for a kid to have a childhood pet?

2014
01:20:43.08 --> 01:20:43.92
Is that unreasonable?

2015
01:20:43.92 --> 01:20:44.76
No, no, it's good.

2016
01:20:44.76 --> 01:20:47.12
And as you just mentioned, there's lessons to be learned.

2017
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:47.96
Exactly, right.

2018
01:20:47.96 --> 01:20:49.000
Which goes into decentralized command.

2019
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.36
You know that is this something you can decentralize?

2020
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:53.16
So what did you go, oh, we're gonna get this dog

2021
01:20:53.16 --> 01:20:54.32
and then I'm gonna have to walk it.

2022
01:20:54.32 --> 01:20:55.40
I'm gonna have to feed it.

2023
01:20:55.40 --> 01:20:56.36
No, you were probably like,

2024
01:20:56.36 --> 01:20:59.72
hey, I'm not cleaning up dog shit, right?

2025
01:20:59.72 --> 01:21:01.92
I'm not gonna be the one that feeds it every day.

2026
01:21:01.92 --> 01:21:04.36
So you knew you could decentralize some of this stuff.

2027
01:21:04.36 --> 01:21:07.68
So that is additionally positive here.

2028
01:21:08.68 --> 01:21:10.84
Was it your ego that was getting in the way a little bit?

2029
01:21:10.84 --> 01:21:12.92
Cause, hey, check it out.

2030
01:21:12.92 --> 01:21:15.80
Let's face it, the dog is gonna take a little attention away

2031
01:21:15.80 --> 01:21:18.08
from Echo Charles just a little bit, right?

2032
01:21:18.08 --> 01:21:19.68
And plus you might have been like,

2033
01:21:19.68 --> 01:21:21.56
hey, this is my house, right?

2034
01:21:21.56 --> 01:21:22.88
You could get into that mode.

2035
01:21:22.88 --> 01:21:24.48
And that is,

2036
01:21:24.48 --> 01:21:26.32
I'm not saying you did, but it could be a fact.

2037
01:21:26.32 --> 01:21:27.68
It did a little bit, maybe not necessarily

2038
01:21:27.68 --> 01:21:28.80
in that particular way.

2039
01:21:28.80 --> 01:21:30.56
Like this is my house and I make those, it wasn't that.

2040
01:21:30.56 --> 01:21:33.60
It was more about like, oh yeah, everyone wants this dog,

2041
01:21:33.60 --> 01:21:34.96
but what about what I want?

2042
01:21:34.96 --> 01:21:36.000
It was like that.

2043
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.44
And I was like, bro, that's kind of wack.

2044
01:21:37.44 --> 01:21:39.28
You don't want to realize that.

2045
01:21:39.28 --> 01:21:40.28
Good, okay.

2046
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:42.64
Emotion.

2047
01:21:43.64 --> 01:21:48.64
You had to at least check the emotion that you were having

2048
01:21:48.64 --> 01:21:50.28
and that everyone else was having.

2049
01:21:50.28 --> 01:21:52.56
Cause if you don't, you, you weighed in

2050
01:21:52.56 --> 01:21:54.76
how happy everyone was gonna be.

2051
01:21:54.76 --> 01:21:57.08
And that countered how like somewhat frustrated

2052
01:21:57.08 --> 01:21:57.92
you were gonna be.

2053
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:00.24
You actually went through this and thought to yourself,

2054
01:22:00.24 --> 01:22:01.16
you know what?

2055
01:22:01.16 --> 01:22:04.08
Them being super happy outweighs me being

2056
01:22:04.08 --> 01:22:05.08
a little bit aggravated.

2057
01:22:05.08 --> 01:22:07.72
So you put, you did the calculus of the emotion,

2058
01:22:07.72 --> 01:22:10.28
made the right call, mission.

2059
01:22:10.28 --> 01:22:12.52
Does this help our mission as a family?

2060
01:22:12.52 --> 01:22:14.24
Again, helps bring the family together.

2061
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:15.56
There's lessons to be learned.

2062
01:22:15.56 --> 01:22:17.36
We have something to talk about.

2063
01:22:17.36 --> 01:22:19.08
We have a, what's that?

2064
01:22:19.08 --> 01:22:23.20
A common affection towards this thing.

2065
01:22:23.20 --> 01:22:25.36
Even though this thing is small and weak

2066
01:22:25.36 --> 01:22:26.72
and doesn't really protect us from anything,

2067
01:22:26.72 --> 01:22:27.56
which is okay.

2068
01:22:27.56 --> 01:22:30.56
But it gets the kids outside even more,

2069
01:22:30.56 --> 01:22:31.72
you know, all this stuff.

2070
01:22:31.72 --> 01:22:32.56
Leadership cap.

2071
01:22:32.56 --> 01:22:33.56
So this is where we get to.

2072
01:22:33.56 --> 01:22:35.64
So now you got to a point where as leadership capital,

2073
01:22:35.64 --> 01:22:37.36
you were, and how did you calculate that

2074
01:22:37.36 --> 01:22:38.24
on the dog purchase?

2075
01:22:38.24 --> 01:22:41.76
Which in a small way went back to measuring the emotions

2076
01:22:41.76 --> 01:22:43.60
and comparing them, but it was essentially that.

2077
01:22:43.60 --> 01:22:46.08
Like people, everyone knew that I didn't want a dog.

2078
01:22:46.08 --> 01:22:47.88
In fact, they've been knowing it for two years.

2079
01:22:47.88 --> 01:22:50.52
I'm not the kind of person, whatever that,

2080
01:22:50.52 --> 01:22:53.04
that's like, no, you know, like I don't complain

2081
01:22:53.04 --> 01:22:54.20
about that kind of stuff, but they,

2082
01:22:54.20 --> 01:22:57.24
everyone knew that I was not really into it at all.

2083
01:22:58.88 --> 01:23:01.52
When we got it, I didn't be like, yeah, I wasn't into it,

2084
01:23:01.52 --> 01:23:03.16
but I did it anyway for you guys.

2085
01:23:03.16 --> 01:23:04.28
None of that kind of stuff.

2086
01:23:04.28 --> 01:23:05.72
I was just kind of like, I was like,

2087
01:23:05.72 --> 01:23:07.16
hey, if that's what we're doing, let's do it.

2088
01:23:07.16 --> 01:23:09.60
And I'm so, actually I will clean up after it.

2089
01:23:09.60 --> 01:23:13.88
Not as a priority, but I'm down for the support, 100%.

2090
01:23:13.88 --> 01:23:18.88
So when it was time to get the dog or whatever,

2091
01:23:19.24 --> 01:23:21.48
I was like, I basically got on board.

2092
01:23:21.48 --> 01:23:24.40
And I figured, and I guess in terms of leadership cap,

2093
01:23:24.40 --> 01:23:26.52
I wasn't thinking of it in terms of leadership cap at all,

2094
01:23:26.52 --> 01:23:28.52
but I wasn't thinking of it in terms of like,

2095
01:23:28.52 --> 01:23:31.36
hey, what would like, what's the right thing to do here?

2096
01:23:31.36 --> 01:23:34.84
And something that would, if I get on board

2097
01:23:34.84 --> 01:23:37.44
in a positive way, in a conducive way,

2098
01:23:37.44 --> 01:23:39.96
that's gonna be better off for everybody.

2099
01:23:40.92 --> 01:23:42.52
So that's just what I did.

2100
01:23:42.52 --> 01:23:44.76
But kind of maybe, how should I say,

2101
01:23:45.68 --> 01:23:48.56
inadvertently or whatever, just not thinking of it.

2102
01:23:48.56 --> 01:23:50.04
I'm sure that did,

2103
01:23:50.04 --> 01:23:51.52
because people know that I didn't want the dog,

2104
01:23:51.52 --> 01:23:53.44
but meanwhile I have a good attitude about it.

2105
01:23:53.44 --> 01:23:54.76
I'm still cleaning up.

2106
01:23:54.76 --> 01:23:56.76
And let's face it, this is the classic tale, right?

2107
01:23:56.76 --> 01:23:57.96
Where the dad doesn't want the dog,

2108
01:23:57.96 --> 01:23:59.52
then the dad ends up being the best friend

2109
01:23:59.52 --> 01:24:01.32
of the dog kind of a thing, you know?

2110
01:24:01.32 --> 01:24:02.40
We're not quite there yet,

2111
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:05.000
but I have embraced the dog on a personal level.

2112
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.76
Teeny, tiny dog.

2113
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:12.20
So I feel like, if they even notice, who knows?

2114
01:24:12.20 --> 01:24:13.48
They're little kids.

2115
01:24:14.48 --> 01:24:16.60
I guarantee you that's the leadership capital out of this.

2116
01:24:16.60 --> 01:24:18.000
Guaranteed.

2117
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.12
And that's good.

2118
01:24:19.12 --> 01:24:20.12
That's good.

2119
01:24:20.12 --> 01:24:22.84
Because over time, also, you gotta think,

2120
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:24.96
how much am I spending leadership capital

2121
01:24:24.96 --> 01:24:27.28
when this is the one thing they want

2122
01:24:27.28 --> 01:24:28.92
and I'm not getting it for them?

2123
01:24:28.92 --> 01:24:30.60
That could be a problem.

2124
01:24:30.60 --> 01:24:32.000
And I shouldn't even say,

2125
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I probably wouldn't actually be that big of a problem.

2126
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.16
And the reason it's not that big of a problem,

2127
01:24:35.16 --> 01:24:37.000
because it's a huge ask, right?

2128
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It's a huge ask.

2129
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.16
A dog is a big deal, man.

2130
01:24:40.16 --> 01:24:42.72
You can't just be getting a dog on a whim.

2131
01:24:42.72 --> 01:24:44.52
You should go through this checklist

2132
01:24:45.64 --> 01:24:47.88
before you go and invest in a dog

2133
01:24:47.88 --> 01:24:49.72
or pick up a dog from the dog pound

2134
01:24:49.72 --> 01:24:51.20
or whatever you're gonna do.

2135
01:24:51.20 --> 01:24:53.68
Here's what I do have in mind consciously

2136
01:24:53.68 --> 01:24:55.40
in regards to leadership capital.

2137
01:24:55.40 --> 01:24:58.28
If I complain about that dog or about having the dog,

2138
01:24:58.28 --> 01:24:59.72
not even necessarily about the dog,

2139
01:24:59.72 --> 01:25:00.56
because you can complain about it,

2140
01:25:00.56 --> 01:25:02.72
like, frick, the dog's barking, you know, whatever.

2141
01:25:02.72 --> 01:25:05.92
But if I complain about having the dog,

2142
01:25:05.92 --> 01:25:08.28
that is like, to me, it feels like I'm like,

2143
01:25:08.28 --> 01:25:10.64
spending so much of that leadership capital

2144
01:25:10.64 --> 01:25:12.72
because it's like, I never wanted that dog, you know?

2145
01:25:12.72 --> 01:25:15.16
Making everyone feel guilty or something like this.

2146
01:25:15.16 --> 01:25:16.000
Never.

2147
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.36
It's against the straight up morals.

2148
01:25:19.36 --> 01:25:20.44
Yeah, that would be that.

2149
01:25:20.44 --> 01:25:21.92
That's so strict, I think, that release.

2150
01:25:21.92 --> 01:25:22.76
That would be that.

2151
01:25:22.76 --> 01:25:26.96
So, leadership capital, put that in the calculus.

2152
01:25:26.96 --> 01:25:29.04
It's more valuable than the air that you breathe

2153
01:25:29.04 --> 01:25:30.64
from a leadership perspective.

2154
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:33.08
Now, the next thing is, as,

2155
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:36.04
and I've mentioned this a bunch already,

2156
01:25:36.04 --> 01:25:38.56
but as I'm judging or assessing all these aspects

2157
01:25:38.56 --> 01:25:41.44
of a decision, I am going to the whole time,

2158
01:25:41.44 --> 01:25:43.56
pay attention to my own bias.

2159
01:25:46.88 --> 01:25:48.20
You know, do I tend to think

2160
01:25:48.20 --> 01:25:49.72
that I have too much leadership capital?

2161
01:25:49.72 --> 01:25:50.76
Because there's people that are like that.

2162
01:25:50.76 --> 01:25:52.48
They think, oh, hey, man, don't worry.

2163
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:54.28
I'm jockeling, man, people are just, no.

2164
01:25:55.60 --> 01:25:57.52
Do I underestimate the amount

2165
01:25:57.52 --> 01:25:59.68
of leadership capital that I have?

2166
01:25:59.68 --> 01:26:02.92
First of all, that's rare, and it's usually not true.

2167
01:26:02.92 --> 01:26:06.52
But those are things that I am going to do.

2168
01:26:06.52 --> 01:26:09.36
I am going to constantly be assessing my own bias.

2169
01:26:09.36 --> 01:26:11.96
So you might wanna throw onto your leadership loop

2170
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:16.56
bias assessment to make sure that you're not

2171
01:26:16.56 --> 01:26:20.04
making a mistake because of the biases that you have.

2172
01:26:20.04 --> 01:26:24.04
Or you can put that into each one of these topics,

2173
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:27.28
ego, emotion, mission, leadership capital.

2174
01:26:27.28 --> 01:26:29.84
You can put bias into each one of those subcategories

2175
01:26:29.84 --> 01:26:31.76
to say, you know what?

2176
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:33.96
I know I'm always letting my ego get in the way.

2177
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:35.84
Or maybe you're saying the other opposite side,

2178
01:26:35.84 --> 01:26:38.44
you know I'm never confident enough with my decisions.

2179
01:26:39.76 --> 01:26:41.32
On time, right?

2180
01:26:41.32 --> 01:26:42.76
What's your bias?

2181
01:26:42.76 --> 01:26:44.44
Do you think everything takes five minutes

2182
01:26:44.44 --> 01:26:46.000
when it really takes a half an hour?

2183
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.64
Calculate that bias.

2184
01:26:49.32 --> 01:26:50.92
And then the last thing I'm gonna say here

2185
01:26:50.92 --> 01:26:53.86
is something that I like to think about.

2186
01:26:55.76 --> 01:26:57.92
Am I looking at the symptoms

2187
01:26:57.92 --> 01:27:01.04
or am I looking at the root cause?

2188
01:27:03.04 --> 01:27:07.96
Because a lot of times the solution

2189
01:27:07.96 --> 01:27:10.24
that's right in front of your face

2190
01:27:10.24 --> 01:27:12.24
is actually a solution to a symptom.

2191
01:27:13.28 --> 01:27:16.32
And we see this like 2D solution

2192
01:27:16.32 --> 01:27:17.16
that's right in front of us.

2193
01:27:17.16 --> 01:27:18.000
And it's usually obvious.

2194
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.16
And here's what's tricky, it's usually right.

2195
01:27:21.56 --> 01:27:24.80
Usually the first, you know, if Echo's doing something

2196
01:27:24.80 --> 01:27:26.44
or if we gotta come up with a plan

2197
01:27:26.44 --> 01:27:29.88
and I come up with a quick plan to solve a problem,

2198
01:27:29.88 --> 01:27:32.96
usually that first plan that we both see is a solution

2199
01:27:32.96 --> 01:27:34.28
and it will work.

2200
01:27:34.28 --> 01:27:37.48
But there's a good chance that we're both reacting

2201
01:27:37.48 --> 01:27:40.44
to a symptom and not to the disease.

2202
01:27:40.44 --> 01:27:44.24
So I like to just check myself and say

2203
01:27:44.24 --> 01:27:46.96
is what I'm looking at the symptom?

2204
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:51.36
Or is it the actual root cause of the problem?

2205
01:27:51.36 --> 01:27:53.28
And is the solution that's being proposed

2206
01:27:53.28 --> 01:27:54.80
or the plan I'm coming up with,

2207
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:56.28
is it a 2D solution for something

2208
01:27:56.28 --> 01:27:57.12
that's right in front of me?

2209
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.36
Or is it a 3D that will actually get us a long-term solution?

2210
01:28:03.60 --> 01:28:05.28
So that's what I'm gonna look at.

2211
01:28:05.28 --> 01:28:08.76
Now, here's what messes us up in this loop

2212
01:28:08.76 --> 01:28:10.40
and it's pretty similar to what can mess you up

2213
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:11.72
in the OODA loop.

2214
01:28:11.72 --> 01:28:14.96
Number one is you can get stuck in any one of these areas.

2215
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:16.20
Just like you get stuck in the OODA loop,

2216
01:28:16.20 --> 01:28:18.08
in the OODA loop you can get stuck observing.

2217
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:19.12
You're just looking around, looking around,

2218
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:20.64
trying to see what you see.

2219
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:23.44
You're trying to get every angle and you get stuck there.

2220
01:28:23.44 --> 01:28:26.000
You get stuck looking around and you get shot down.

2221
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.32
Maybe you get stuck orienting yourself.

2222
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:30.16
You're like, wait, hold on, where are they?

2223
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:31.000
Where am I?

2224
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.04
Hold on, let me see exactly where I'm in.

2225
01:28:32.04 --> 01:28:33.76
You get shot down.

2226
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:35.28
Maybe you get stuck in the decision,

2227
01:28:35.28 --> 01:28:36.48
but wait, should I go left, should I go right,

2228
01:28:36.48 --> 01:28:37.32
should I go left, should I go right?

2229
01:28:37.32 --> 01:28:38.16
I don't know if there's advantage,

2230
01:28:38.16 --> 01:28:39.000
it's going left, there's advantage,

2231
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.96
going right, you get shot down.

2232
01:28:40.96 --> 01:28:44.08
Or act, you won't take action.

2233
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:46.12
You don't do the action, you get shot down.

2234
01:28:47.16 --> 01:28:50.56
So if you get stuck in any of these as well, same thing.

2235
01:28:50.56 --> 01:28:55.56
If you get stuck thinking about any of these things,

2236
01:28:55.56 --> 01:28:57.80
and you let it become the focus,

2237
01:28:57.80 --> 01:28:59.44
I want to make sure my ego's not a problem.

2238
01:28:59.44 --> 01:29:00.52
And that's what you focus on.

2239
01:29:00.52 --> 01:29:02.48
You don't consider time, you don't consider emotion,

2240
01:29:02.48 --> 01:29:03.60
you don't consider the mission.

2241
01:29:03.60 --> 01:29:07.38
So you can't get stuck on any of these things.

2242
01:29:10.84 --> 01:29:12.04
You can't get stuck.

2243
01:29:13.52 --> 01:29:16.72
You have to let the loop continue to flow.

2244
01:29:16.72 --> 01:29:18.04
And you know what you're gonna figure out?

2245
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:19.32
You're gonna figure out that there's some things

2246
01:29:19.32 --> 01:29:20.80
that you're good at in this loop,

2247
01:29:20.80 --> 01:29:22.44
and there's some things that you're bad at in this loop.

2248
01:29:22.44 --> 01:29:24.72
Maybe your ego's not a problem,

2249
01:29:24.72 --> 01:29:26.80
but you have a problem with time.

2250
01:29:26.80 --> 01:29:30.20
Maybe your emotion isn't a problem,

2251
01:29:30.20 --> 01:29:33.20
but you always get distracted by different missions.

2252
01:29:34.56 --> 01:29:37.24
Maybe you cover and move really well,

2253
01:29:37.24 --> 01:29:39.80
but you don't realize that you expend leadership capital

2254
01:29:39.80 --> 01:29:41.20
on stuff that doesn't matter.

2255
01:29:42.20 --> 01:29:44.68
So you want to continually observe these things,

2256
01:29:44.68 --> 01:29:46.52
and you want to overindex on the things

2257
01:29:46.52 --> 01:29:48.28
that you know you are weak at.

2258
01:29:49.32 --> 01:29:52.40
So that's the number one way that we get messed up

2259
01:29:52.40 --> 01:29:53.72
when we're making decisions.

2260
01:29:53.72 --> 01:29:57.04
The number two things we ignore the feedback

2261
01:29:57.04 --> 01:30:00.64
that we're getting, which is such a disaster.

2262
01:30:00.64 --> 01:30:05.04
It's such a disaster to ignore the feedback

2263
01:30:05.04 --> 01:30:05.88
that we're getting.

2264
01:30:05.88 --> 01:30:09.88
And the point I made earlier about Echo Charles

2265
01:30:09.88 --> 01:30:11.60
and how my ego is gonna lie to me,

2266
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:16.08
your ego is lying 100% of the time.

2267
01:30:16.08 --> 01:30:16.92
Let me just say that.

2268
01:30:16.92 --> 01:30:19.52
My ego is saying, actually, in this case,

2269
01:30:19.52 --> 01:30:24.12
Jocko, look, I know I get it, but this echo really is the problem.

2270
01:30:24.12 --> 01:30:25.72
He really is the problem.

2271
01:30:25.72 --> 01:30:30.32
That, and when I ignore that, the fact that,

2272
01:30:30.32 --> 01:30:31.76
I'm sorry, not that I ignore it,

2273
01:30:31.76 --> 01:30:34.20
but I let my ego convince me that, you know what,

2274
01:30:34.20 --> 01:30:36.68
this time, just this one time, my ego's right.

2275
01:30:36.68 --> 01:30:37.56
It's not.

2276
01:30:37.56 --> 01:30:40.000
Or just this one time, hey, this is an emotional decision.

2277
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.52
It's the right thing to do.

2278
01:30:41.52 --> 01:30:43.92
Jocko said, you need to put emotions into calculus,

2279
01:30:43.92 --> 01:30:45.12
and I'm pissed, so we're gonna do it.

2280
01:30:45.12 --> 01:30:45.96
No.

2281
01:30:45.96 --> 01:30:51.60
We ignore feedback, and of course,

2282
01:30:51.60 --> 01:30:54.48
this comes from a lack of humility.

2283
01:30:54.48 --> 01:30:57.32
When you're being told something, even in your own head,

2284
01:30:57.32 --> 01:31:00.24
but you ignore it, like, you know,

2285
01:31:00.24 --> 01:31:02.40
I know Echo might kinda get screwed by this decision,

2286
01:31:02.40 --> 01:31:05.04
but you know, he's not gonna notice, boom.

2287
01:31:05.04 --> 01:31:06.32
You're just lying to yourself.

2288
01:31:06.32 --> 01:31:09.80
You're ignoring the feedback, and that's gonna cost you.

2289
01:31:09.80 --> 01:31:12.08
And so in order to do that, this comes back

2290
01:31:12.08 --> 01:31:16.60
to a fundamental skill of leadership

2291
01:31:16.60 --> 01:31:18.36
that I wrote about in leadership strategy and tactics,

2292
01:31:18.36 --> 01:31:20.84
and that is the ability to take a step back and detach.

2293
01:31:20.84 --> 01:31:22.36
That's the only way you're gonna see this stuff.

2294
01:31:22.36 --> 01:31:24.84
You can't, detachment is a superpower,

2295
01:31:24.84 --> 01:31:27.16
and the reason that detachment is a superpower

2296
01:31:27.16 --> 01:31:29.52
is because the solution to the problem

2297
01:31:29.52 --> 01:31:31.60
is not in the problem.

2298
01:31:33.92 --> 01:31:36.28
The solution to the problem will not be found

2299
01:31:36.28 --> 01:31:37.40
inside the problem.

2300
01:31:37.40 --> 01:31:39.08
You gotta step outside the problem

2301
01:31:39.08 --> 01:31:41.08
in order to see the solution.

2302
01:31:41.08 --> 01:31:43.36
Don't get wrapped up in the problem itself.

2303
01:31:45.68 --> 01:31:50.08
Instead, take a step back, run through this loop

2304
01:31:50.08 --> 01:31:51.88
so you can make better decisions.

2305
01:31:53.08 --> 01:31:56.08
And what is an important thing to recognize?

2306
01:31:57.36 --> 01:31:59.28
You might be thinking like, oh, well, I'm not, you know,

2307
01:31:59.28 --> 01:32:00.72
the CEO of some big company,

2308
01:32:00.72 --> 01:32:02.32
and I don't need me to make a bunch of decisions.

2309
01:32:02.32 --> 01:32:03.16
Guess what?

2310
01:32:03.16 --> 01:32:08.16
Life is a series of decisions all day, every day.

2311
01:32:08.76 --> 01:32:09.64
That's what life is.

2312
01:32:09.64 --> 01:32:11.52
Everything that you do is a decision.

2313
01:32:13.32 --> 01:32:17.92
It's almost like the binary decision,

2314
01:32:17.92 --> 01:32:20.20
which I wrote about in Discipline and Freedom's Manual.

2315
01:32:20.20 --> 01:32:21.72
Everything that you do is a decision.

2316
01:32:21.72 --> 01:32:23.08
They're not always necessarily binary,

2317
01:32:23.08 --> 01:32:25.84
but when you live life, you're making decisions.

2318
01:32:25.84 --> 01:32:27.48
Everything you do is a decision.

2319
01:32:29.12 --> 01:32:31.32
So because everything you do is a decision,

2320
01:32:31.32 --> 01:32:33.16
once you realize that, you should detach,

2321
01:32:33.16 --> 01:32:37.40
and you should have a protocol for making decisions

2322
01:32:37.40 --> 01:32:40.40
because then your decisions will be better.

2323
01:32:40.40 --> 01:32:42.72
And you should have the humility to realize

2324
01:32:42.72 --> 01:32:44.60
when you aren't making good decisions,

2325
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:46.12
and when you get that feedback and realize,

2326
01:32:46.12 --> 01:32:48.24
oh, I gotta make some different decisions now.

2327
01:32:49.32 --> 01:32:50.40
And then you make adjustments,

2328
01:32:50.40 --> 01:32:52.76
and you make better decisions, and you move on.

2329
01:32:54.68 --> 01:32:59.24
But, and what's beautiful about this is it means

2330
01:33:00.44 --> 01:33:01.88
that if everything in your life

2331
01:33:01.88 --> 01:33:05.72
is based on the decisions you're making, guess what?

2332
01:33:05.72 --> 01:33:08.72
You have a lot of control over your life

2333
01:33:10.60 --> 01:33:12.40
based on the decisions that you make.

2334
01:33:14.64 --> 01:33:16.56
So make good decisions.

2335
01:33:16.56 --> 01:33:18.04
It's gonna make you a better person.

2336
01:33:18.04 --> 01:33:19.52
It's gonna make you a better leader.

2337
01:33:19.52 --> 01:33:21.12
It's gonna give you a better life.

2338
01:33:23.12 --> 01:33:25.000
All right, there you go.

2339
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:25.96
Echo Charles.

2340
01:33:25.96 --> 01:33:27.24
Yes sir.

2341
01:33:27.24 --> 01:33:28.52
Speaking of good decisions,

2342
01:33:28.52 --> 01:33:30.20
I know there's some ways that people could decide

2343
01:33:30.20 --> 01:33:32.20
to support themselves a little bit better.

2344
01:33:32.20 --> 01:33:34.04
Yeah, it's true.

2345
01:33:34.04 --> 01:33:36.000
And they could support this podcast while they're doing it.

2346
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:36.84
It's true.

2347
01:33:36.84 --> 01:33:38.32
They could support America while they're doing it.

2348
01:33:38.32 --> 01:33:39.44
Very true, yeah.

2349
01:33:39.44 --> 01:33:41.40
Which is kind of a big deal.

2350
01:33:41.40 --> 01:33:43.80
Especially considering how tenuous the world is right now.

2351
01:33:43.80 --> 01:33:44.84
World's a tenuous place.

2352
01:33:44.84 --> 01:33:45.68
Sure.

2353
01:33:45.68 --> 01:33:48.24
There's other elements out there making a move.

2354
01:33:49.24 --> 01:33:50.48
Got China making a move.

2355
01:33:50.48 --> 01:33:52.08
They're out there making a move.

2356
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:53.44
They're trying to take the rushes out there.

2357
01:33:53.44 --> 01:33:54.68
They're making a move.

2358
01:33:54.68 --> 01:33:56.20
People are stepping up.

2359
01:33:56.20 --> 01:33:57.24
Moves are being made.

2360
01:33:57.24 --> 01:33:58.60
Moves are being made.

2361
01:33:58.60 --> 01:34:00.000
And are we gonna sit back?

2362
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:02.88
Now, does this mean you need to pick up a rifle

2363
01:34:02.88 --> 01:34:03.72
and go to war?

2364
01:34:03.72 --> 01:34:04.56
No.

2365
01:34:04.56 --> 01:34:05.40
But I'll tell you what you can do.

2366
01:34:05.40 --> 01:34:07.08
You can support America.

2367
01:34:08.36 --> 01:34:09.56
I know a good way to do that.

2368
01:34:09.56 --> 01:34:11.20
Yeah, me too.

2369
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:13.76
Well, it starts with ourselves, right?

2370
01:34:13.76 --> 01:34:14.88
I think a lot of the time.

2371
01:34:14.88 --> 01:34:17.64
Do you talk about good decisions where,

2372
01:34:17.64 --> 01:34:20.08
look, other people not making decisions for you

2373
01:34:20.08 --> 01:34:21.92
unless you're letting them.

2374
01:34:21.92 --> 01:34:24.84
But you wanna make good decisions for yourself, right?

2375
01:34:24.84 --> 01:34:25.68
I would imagine.

2376
01:34:25.68 --> 01:34:26.92
So it starts with yourself.

2377
01:34:26.92 --> 01:34:31.92
We're taking care of ourselves physically, mentally.

2378
01:34:31.92 --> 01:34:32.76
Mentally.

2379
01:34:33.60 --> 01:34:34.44
Deciding to.

2380
01:34:34.44 --> 01:34:35.28
That's what we're doing.

2381
01:34:35.28 --> 01:34:36.60
It's true.

2382
01:34:36.60 --> 01:34:38.72
So we're working out, of course.

2383
01:34:38.72 --> 01:34:39.56
100%.

2384
01:34:39.56 --> 01:34:40.48
We're reading.

2385
01:34:40.48 --> 01:34:41.32
I know that.

2386
01:34:41.32 --> 01:34:42.16
Yes, we are.

2387
01:34:42.16 --> 01:34:43.000
We should be.

2388
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:43.84
At the very least listening.

2389
01:34:43.84 --> 01:34:44.68
Wait, are you reading?

2390
01:34:44.68 --> 01:34:45.76
I'm reading here and there.

2391
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:47.08
Bro, I don't know about this.

2392
01:34:47.08 --> 01:34:48.52
Wait a second here.

2393
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:49.44
What are you reading?

2394
01:34:50.60 --> 01:34:52.76
Well, there was, okay, so there's a book.

2395
01:34:52.76 --> 01:34:54.28
You can't reference mind games

2396
01:34:54.28 --> 01:34:56.24
which you read nine years ago.

2397
01:34:56.24 --> 01:34:57.36
Yeah, probably not.

2398
01:34:57.36 --> 01:35:00.32
I think that may be the only book you've ever referenced

2399
01:35:00.32 --> 01:35:01.28
since I've known you.

2400
01:35:01.28 --> 01:35:02.12
Oh, I don't know.

2401
01:35:02.12 --> 01:35:02.94
I've read plenty of books.

2402
01:35:02.94 --> 01:35:03.78
Okay, what do we got?

2403
01:35:03.78 --> 01:35:04.62
What's on the docket?

2404
01:35:04.62 --> 01:35:05.46
Echo Charles.

2405
01:35:05.46 --> 01:35:06.88
Most of the time I'm gonna tell you what's currently

2406
01:35:06.88 --> 01:35:08.88
on the docket, because it'd have to, you know.

2407
01:35:08.88 --> 01:35:09.72
But.

2408
01:35:09.72 --> 01:35:11.24
Wait a second, bro.

2409
01:35:11.24 --> 01:35:12.32
You can be honest.

2410
01:35:12.32 --> 01:35:13.56
We're telling each other the truth.

2411
01:35:13.56 --> 01:35:15.60
This is like leadership, you know,

2412
01:35:15.60 --> 01:35:17.52
a capital we're trying to build.

2413
01:35:17.52 --> 01:35:18.72
If you're not gonna tell me like,

2414
01:35:18.72 --> 01:35:20.40
oh, no, no, right now I'm not reading anything,

2415
01:35:20.40 --> 01:35:21.60
Jock, because you know, it's summertime

2416
01:35:21.60 --> 01:35:22.60
and I was in Hawaii.

2417
01:35:22.60 --> 01:35:24.76
And so we're not reading anything unless you are.

2418
01:35:24.76 --> 01:35:25.60
Yes.

2419
01:35:25.60 --> 01:35:26.42
So.

2420
01:35:26.42 --> 01:35:27.26
So what are we reading right now?

2421
01:35:27.26 --> 01:35:28.10
Nothing or this book?

2422
01:35:28.10 --> 01:35:30.48
So depends, because that's a spectrum.

2423
01:35:30.48 --> 01:35:31.32
Right?

2424
01:35:31.32 --> 01:35:32.14
Right.

2425
01:35:32.14 --> 01:35:32.98
Bro.

2426
01:35:32.98 --> 01:35:33.82
Bro.

2427
01:35:33.82 --> 01:35:36.20
You should own this a hundred percent right now.

2428
01:35:36.20 --> 01:35:37.44
Otherwise it's not gonna look right.

2429
01:35:37.44 --> 01:35:40.24
Here's a hundred percent truth on the matter.

2430
01:35:40.24 --> 01:35:44.20
So I have Kindle books and audio books, like,

2431
01:35:44.20 --> 01:35:45.48
you know, some are halfway done,

2432
01:35:45.48 --> 01:35:47.24
some are all done, some are whatever.

2433
01:35:47.24 --> 01:35:51.44
So when, how much time has to be elapsed

2434
01:35:51.44 --> 01:35:53.92
between the last time I was into one of these books,

2435
01:35:53.92 --> 01:35:57.40
actually like reading it or listening to it to now,

2436
01:35:57.40 --> 01:36:01.48
how much time has to pass before I'm technically not reading?

2437
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:03.68
Let's just say a week.

2438
01:36:03.68 --> 01:36:04.96
Okay.

2439
01:36:04.96 --> 01:36:06.30
We might not be reading.

2440
01:36:06.30 --> 01:36:07.12
No.

2441
01:36:08.86 --> 01:36:09.70
But.

2442
01:36:09.70 --> 01:36:10.54
All right.

2443
01:36:10.54 --> 01:36:11.36
That being said.

2444
01:36:11.36 --> 01:36:12.20
That's kind of a bummer.

2445
01:36:12.20 --> 01:36:13.04
That means that the books that you're reading

2446
01:36:13.04 --> 01:36:16.68
or even listening to must not be that captivating.

2447
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:18.28
Or, well, yeah, I mean,

2448
01:36:18.28 --> 01:36:20.48
I guess in a manner of speaking technically, yeah,

2449
01:36:20.48 --> 01:36:23.000
but that doesn't mean that they're not captivating.

2450
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.84
That might mean that other things that I'm doing.

2451
01:36:25.84 --> 01:36:26.68
They're competing with life.

2452
01:36:26.68 --> 01:36:30.16
And life is captivating, which is a good thing.

2453
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:31.000
Yes, sir.

2454
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:31.84
Right?

2455
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:32.88
I never thought of that comeback.

2456
01:36:32.88 --> 01:36:33.72
You know, some people are like,

2457
01:36:33.72 --> 01:36:35.40
I'm reading three books a week.

2458
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:37.24
Be like, oh, that's cool.

2459
01:36:37.24 --> 01:36:38.68
I'm actually living.

2460
01:36:38.68 --> 01:36:39.52
Yeah.

2461
01:36:39.52 --> 01:36:40.34
Right?

2462
01:36:40.34 --> 01:36:41.68
That could be a little bit of a dichotomy.

2463
01:36:41.68 --> 01:36:42.60
Could be, yes.

2464
01:36:42.60 --> 01:36:43.92
And obviously that's going to depend

2465
01:36:43.92 --> 01:36:45.36
because reading three books a week,

2466
01:36:45.36 --> 01:36:47.08
one, we don't know how fast they read or listen

2467
01:36:47.08 --> 01:36:48.68
or whatever or what they're doing.

2468
01:36:48.68 --> 01:36:50.44
You know, what if they're going out miles, runs,

2469
01:36:50.44 --> 01:36:51.28
we're doing the same thing.

2470
01:36:51.28 --> 01:36:52.36
You know, it's kind of a, you know,

2471
01:36:52.36 --> 01:36:53.88
so it can be an awesome,

2472
01:36:53.88 --> 01:36:55.56
it can be kind of what you're alluding to

2473
01:36:55.56 --> 01:36:56.40
where it's like cool.

2474
01:36:56.40 --> 01:36:57.24
Flexing, no.

2475
01:36:57.24 --> 01:36:59.08
That's fine.

2476
01:36:59.08 --> 01:37:01.12
Oh wait, flexing with the, I'm reading.

2477
01:37:01.12 --> 01:37:02.24
That's just a flex.

2478
01:37:02.24 --> 01:37:07.24
Like, like a fourth book I've read this month.

2479
01:37:07.48 --> 01:37:08.32
Right, right.

2480
01:37:08.32 --> 01:37:10.20
Just to sort of brag and make like, yeah.

2481
01:37:10.20 --> 01:37:14.32
Well, you know, there are many variations of flexing.

2482
01:37:14.32 --> 01:37:16.76
Cause it'd be an interesting reflex.

2483
01:37:16.76 --> 01:37:19.80
We'll be like, I don't have time to read books.

2484
01:37:19.80 --> 01:37:20.68
Yeah.

2485
01:37:20.68 --> 01:37:22.000
Or that could be an excuse.

2486
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:22.84
It could be an excuse.

2487
01:37:22.84 --> 01:37:23.84
Yeah, so it just depends.

2488
01:37:23.84 --> 01:37:24.68
It's a dichotomy.

2489
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:26.000
Okay, so where is Echo Charles at?

2490
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.32
In this spectrum that we were considering.

2491
01:37:28.32 --> 01:37:29.40
The last book that I finished,

2492
01:37:29.40 --> 01:37:32.12
which was recently, I don't know, whatever,

2493
01:37:32.12 --> 01:37:33.52
a few months, actually I read it twice.

2494
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:38.16
So it was the four agreements recommended by Jason Gardner.

2495
01:37:38.16 --> 01:37:39.60
Yeah, that's a good one.

2496
01:37:39.60 --> 01:37:41.76
And you guys, I heard you guys talking about it

2497
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:43.64
and you seemed both, you know,

2498
01:37:43.64 --> 01:37:45.20
you were both concurred that it was good.

2499
01:37:45.20 --> 01:37:46.04
Yeah.

2500
01:37:46.04 --> 01:37:48.000
And a lot of times that type of book,

2501
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.84
and I mean, this type, that type of book

2502
01:37:49.84 --> 01:37:52.68
in this particular way is, it's real like,

2503
01:37:52.68 --> 01:37:56.88
like it has a lot of spiritual like terms, you know?

2504
01:37:56.88 --> 01:38:00.16
But, and you know, usually spiritual terms are real.

2505
01:38:00.16 --> 01:38:03.56
Like they land on different people in different ways.

2506
01:38:03.56 --> 01:38:05.24
Okay, I'm not tracking spiritual term.

2507
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:06.08
I.e. what?

2508
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:07.000
What's the spiritual term?

2509
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.84
Like, you know, calling things black magic

2510
01:38:09.84 --> 01:38:11.84
or cause he'll use that term a lot.

2511
01:38:11.84 --> 01:38:14.000
Yeah, but he's using those terms

2512
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.72
cause I heard you guys talking about it.

2513
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:17.24
And I think I might've even been talking

2514
01:38:17.24 --> 01:38:19.76
to you a little bit about it or Jason,

2515
01:38:19.76 --> 01:38:21.60
those are just like an analogy.

2516
01:38:21.60 --> 01:38:24.04
Like this type of attitude is black magic.

2517
01:38:24.04 --> 01:38:24.88
That's negative.

2518
01:38:24.88 --> 01:38:25.72
Yes.

2519
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:26.56
So I took it in that way.

2520
01:38:26.56 --> 01:38:27.40
Okay.

2521
01:38:27.40 --> 01:38:28.24
Like, this is an analogy.

2522
01:38:28.24 --> 01:38:30.12
It's not like he was saying his literal black magic.

2523
01:38:30.12 --> 01:38:30.96
Yeah.

2524
01:38:30.96 --> 01:38:33.44
And every once in a while it kind of felt like that.

2525
01:38:33.44 --> 01:38:36.04
But either way, I never took it as that.

2526
01:38:36.04 --> 01:38:38.36
Like to me, that's not the useful part of it.

2527
01:38:38.36 --> 01:38:39.84
The useful part is many other things,

2528
01:38:39.84 --> 01:38:41.84
but anytime they say something like black magic,

2529
01:38:41.84 --> 01:38:42.88
I know what he's saying.

2530
01:38:42.88 --> 01:38:44.24
I know what you mean.

2531
01:38:44.24 --> 01:38:45.24
I think I do anyway.

2532
01:38:45.24 --> 01:38:46.08
I believe I do.

2533
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:47.84
So I just, I put it that way.

2534
01:38:47.84 --> 01:38:49.56
I took it in that way.

2535
01:38:49.56 --> 01:38:51.04
But yeah.

2536
01:38:51.04 --> 01:38:53.72
So that being said, the spiritual parts,

2537
01:38:53.72 --> 01:38:55.68
even with those spiritual parts or whatever,

2538
01:38:55.68 --> 01:38:57.72
like what he was saying with all the four agreements

2539
01:38:57.72 --> 01:38:59.80
is like very, it's a good one.

2540
01:38:59.80 --> 01:39:00.64
It's a good one.

2541
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:03.64
And a lot of it might not come as like a surprise.

2542
01:39:03.64 --> 01:39:05.60
Like, oh man, I totally didn't know that.

2543
01:39:05.60 --> 01:39:09.000
But just like a lot of books about like ways to think

2544
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.92
and regard yourself and the world and stuff.

2545
01:39:10.92 --> 01:39:13.20
It's like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

2546
01:39:13.20 --> 01:39:14.52
Or that's a good reminder.

2547
01:39:14.52 --> 01:39:15.36
You know.

2548
01:39:15.36 --> 01:39:16.20
It's kind of like what we just covered.

2549
01:39:16.20 --> 01:39:17.04
There's a lot of people that are like,

2550
01:39:17.04 --> 01:39:20.20
of course you should consider if you're screwing over your

2551
01:39:20.20 --> 01:39:21.04
buddy.

2552
01:39:21.04 --> 01:39:21.88
Yep.

2553
01:39:21.88 --> 01:39:23.20
And it seems obvious.

2554
01:39:23.20 --> 01:39:28.20
But there's times that people do this aware, unaware.

2555
01:39:28.52 --> 01:39:29.96
And I think the big warning there is like,

2556
01:39:29.96 --> 01:39:31.48
you think no one notices everybody else.

2557
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:32.32
So yeah.

2558
01:39:32.32 --> 01:39:35.000
Some things can be, actually,

2559
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.76
I think when something seems obvious,

2560
01:39:36.76 --> 01:39:38.88
usually that's affirming to like,

2561
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:41.48
this has got to be, this is pretty true.

2562
01:39:41.48 --> 01:39:42.92
Because I know I felt this way.

2563
01:39:42.92 --> 01:39:44.44
And now I'm seeing this guy felt this way.

2564
01:39:44.44 --> 01:39:46.68
And now, you know, so it becomes like a thing.

2565
01:39:46.68 --> 01:39:47.72
Yeah.

2566
01:39:47.72 --> 01:39:49.80
And sometimes it just puts certain things,

2567
01:39:49.80 --> 01:39:51.36
certain elements into perspective

2568
01:39:51.36 --> 01:39:54.24
that you might not have realized how important they are

2569
01:39:54.24 --> 01:39:56.92
or how prevalent they are in day to day, you know, stuff.

2570
01:39:56.92 --> 01:39:58.04
Awareness.

2571
01:39:58.04 --> 01:40:00.36
When you're aware of things, you become,

2572
01:40:00.36 --> 01:40:05.000
just awareness is a huge step up in understanding

2573
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.44
and reacting properly.

2574
01:40:08.44 --> 01:40:10.76
And interacting properly with the world.

2575
01:40:10.76 --> 01:40:13.56
Like the idea that you actually brought up a few times today,

2576
01:40:13.56 --> 01:40:15.80
the idea that like people notice.

2577
01:40:15.80 --> 01:40:17.60
Like, I see what you're doing or I see

2578
01:40:17.60 --> 01:40:18.80
whether it be your intention

2579
01:40:18.80 --> 01:40:20.72
or when they're getting screwed over, whatever.

2580
01:40:20.72 --> 01:40:24.48
Like the idea that people can see what's going on,

2581
01:40:24.48 --> 01:40:27.40
I think that's one of the many things that's like,

2582
01:40:28.52 --> 01:40:31.44
it helps to understand how big of a thing that is.

2583
01:40:31.44 --> 01:40:32.28
Like, you know how it's like,

2584
01:40:32.28 --> 01:40:33.92
yeah, sometimes they'll notice, sometimes they won't.

2585
01:40:33.92 --> 01:40:35.60
It kind of feels like that sometimes.

2586
01:40:35.60 --> 01:40:36.44
They notice.

2587
01:40:36.44 --> 01:40:37.28
Oh yeah, people know it.

2588
01:40:37.28 --> 01:40:39.40
Like, you know how, and I've said this before,

2589
01:40:39.40 --> 01:40:41.04
I got it from Sam Harris where it's like,

2590
01:40:41.04 --> 01:40:42.60
when you name drop someone,

2591
01:40:42.60 --> 01:40:44.20
it's like, everyone sees you name drop it.

2592
01:40:44.20 --> 01:40:46.16
And it's not even like a noble thing.

2593
01:40:46.16 --> 01:40:47.000
You mean when you talk about it,

2594
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.08
I got this from Sam Harris?

2595
01:40:48.08 --> 01:40:49.32
Oh yeah.

2596
01:40:49.32 --> 01:40:52.20
After we hung out this one day, it was awesome.

2597
01:40:52.20 --> 01:40:56.36
But that's like, one of the many examples of,

2598
01:40:56.36 --> 01:40:58.88
sure maybe somebody caught it,

2599
01:40:58.88 --> 01:41:01.92
but I'm sure it was effective when I did.

2600
01:41:01.92 --> 01:41:03.52
But everyone noticed the same way

2601
01:41:03.52 --> 01:41:05.40
you'll notice when someone else does it.

2602
01:41:05.40 --> 01:41:07.36
It's kind of one of those things.

2603
01:41:07.36 --> 01:41:09.64
But, and there's a lot of things like that.

2604
01:41:09.64 --> 01:41:12.80
You know, so yeah, I think that book overall

2605
01:41:12.80 --> 01:41:14.76
was a lot of that.

2606
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:15.84
But some stuff was like,

2607
01:41:15.84 --> 01:41:18.16
oh, that is a good way to look at things, you know?

2608
01:41:18.16 --> 01:41:20.88
And sometimes when somebody's written something out

2609
01:41:20.88 --> 01:41:23.64
and they've explained it, it clarifies it for you.

2610
01:41:23.64 --> 01:41:25.60
It increases your understanding

2611
01:41:25.60 --> 01:41:27.32
and the better understanding you have,

2612
01:41:27.32 --> 01:41:30.76
then the more you can interact with that properly,

2613
01:41:30.76 --> 01:41:32.80
you can utilize that as a tool.

2614
01:41:32.80 --> 01:41:33.84
That's good stuff.

2615
01:41:33.84 --> 01:41:36.88
So yeah, we wanna read.

2616
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:38.80
Very unvarying levels, you know?

2617
01:41:38.80 --> 01:41:41.48
Yeah, if you start reading one book a week over here,

2618
01:41:41.48 --> 01:41:43.20
you're gonna be like, that's good.

2619
01:41:43.20 --> 01:41:44.20
That's good.

2620
01:41:44.20 --> 01:41:46.60
If you're reading one book a week, that's good, man.

2621
01:41:46.60 --> 01:41:48.52
It's hard to say that that's bad.

2622
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:51.64
Yeah, I don't actually know if I've,

2623
01:41:51.64 --> 01:41:53.56
there was a while where I was reading one book every week

2624
01:41:53.56 --> 01:41:54.64
when we were doing the podcast

2625
01:41:54.64 --> 01:41:57.40
and it was like almost all books.

2626
01:41:57.40 --> 01:41:59.76
And then it seemed like we went a little,

2627
01:41:59.76 --> 01:42:02.84
a bunch of people were coming on for interviews.

2628
01:42:02.84 --> 01:42:05.24
So that was a little bit more interview-centric.

2629
01:42:05.24 --> 01:42:08.60
So, but I, this I can say,

2630
01:42:08.60 --> 01:42:12.04
there is no period of time of more than two days

2631
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:13.36
where I haven't read something.

2632
01:42:13.36 --> 01:42:14.20
Oh, damn.

2633
01:42:14.20 --> 01:42:16.36
Yeah, so that's kind of where I'm at.

2634
01:42:16.36 --> 01:42:18.12
But that's not a flex, bro, because guess what?

2635
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:23.12
Maybe I should be surfing or getting in fights at REI.

2636
01:42:24.20 --> 01:42:26.08
Sure, hell yeah, parking lot fights.

2637
01:42:26.08 --> 01:42:28.24
I'll just explain the situation.

2638
01:42:28.24 --> 01:42:29.76
But we are working out every day.

2639
01:42:29.76 --> 01:42:30.76
You know Joel Tudor, yeah, you know.

2640
01:42:30.76 --> 01:42:31.96
Of course.

2641
01:42:31.96 --> 01:42:34.24
Joel Tudor, he, if you don't know,

2642
01:42:34.24 --> 01:42:37.08
he's surfer and a Jiu-Jitsu guy, awesome guy.

2643
01:42:37.08 --> 01:42:39.68
But he like posted something,

2644
01:42:39.68 --> 01:42:42.72
something about like basically kook surfers.

2645
01:42:42.72 --> 01:42:45.60
Like, you know, surfer Starter Kit,

2646
01:42:45.60 --> 01:42:47.24
Malibu surfer starter kit.

2647
01:42:47.24 --> 01:42:49.24
And one of the pictures was like a sprinter.

2648
01:42:49.24 --> 01:42:50.92
I responded on his post.

2649
01:42:50.92 --> 01:42:53.08
I was like, hey bro, I got a sprinter.

2650
01:42:53.08 --> 01:42:54.16
Yeah, yeah.

2651
01:42:54.16 --> 01:42:55.36
So, sorry Joel.

2652
01:42:55.36 --> 01:42:57.000
Sorry Joel, I got a sprinter.

2653
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:57.84
There, people.

2654
01:42:57.84 --> 01:42:59.96
Well, so it was kind of a confirmation, really.

2655
01:42:59.96 --> 01:43:01.08
You know, small way.

2656
01:43:01.08 --> 01:43:03.88
Oh, they just called me a kook, huh?

2657
01:43:03.88 --> 01:43:05.68
That's messed up.

2658
01:43:05.68 --> 01:43:08.08
I was up on the horses and I asked the guys,

2659
01:43:08.08 --> 01:43:11.12
the actual cowboys, I said, hey, I said, hey,

2660
01:43:11.12 --> 01:43:14.000
in surfing, if you don't know how to surf,

2661
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.92
but you have a surfboard and you're paddling out,

2662
01:43:15.92 --> 01:43:17.76
but you have no idea what you're doing,

2663
01:43:17.76 --> 01:43:19.44
then you're a kook.

2664
01:43:19.44 --> 01:43:22.20
I said, what's that called on horseback riding?

2665
01:43:22.20 --> 01:43:25.48
And, cause that's me, cause I don't know how to ride a horse.

2666
01:43:25.48 --> 01:43:27.64
And they said, it's a dude.

2667
01:43:29.24 --> 01:43:31.48
So there's a thing called a dude ranch,

2668
01:43:31.48 --> 01:43:34.72
which is basically for city slickers to go out

2669
01:43:34.72 --> 01:43:37.20
and like be a cowboy for a little while.

2670
01:43:37.20 --> 01:43:38.04
Oh, I didn't know that.

2671
01:43:38.04 --> 01:43:42.28
And so, if you're one of those people, then you are a dude.

2672
01:43:42.28 --> 01:43:43.60
That's weird, I've heard of dude ranch.

2673
01:43:43.60 --> 01:43:46.12
There was another word that they told me as well,

2674
01:43:46.12 --> 01:43:47.68
but I can't remember it.

2675
01:43:47.68 --> 01:43:48.76
Yeah.

2676
01:43:48.76 --> 01:43:49.60
It's funny.

2677
01:43:49.60 --> 01:43:51.96
But I was one of those, I am one of those on a horse.

2678
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:52.80
You're a dude?

2679
01:43:52.80 --> 01:43:53.64
Yeah.

2680
01:43:53.64 --> 01:43:56.32
That's funny, there was a show called Hey Dude,

2681
01:43:56.32 --> 01:43:58.000
and it was about a dude ranch and it was,

2682
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I think it was on Nickelodeon too or something.

2683
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:00.84
Back in the day.

2684
01:44:00.84 --> 01:44:02.16
Back in the day.

2685
01:44:02.16 --> 01:44:03.72
Well, hey man, learn something new every day.

2686
01:44:03.72 --> 01:44:04.88
See, sometimes you don't even have to read.

2687
01:44:04.88 --> 01:44:07.88
You just come listen to Jocko, being a dude,

2688
01:44:07.88 --> 01:44:10.64
or Kuk, or whatever you're being over there.

2689
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:11.96
But we are working out every day.

2690
01:44:11.96 --> 01:44:13.04
Yes.

2691
01:44:13.04 --> 01:44:14.000
Yes.

2692
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.52
Like currently working out.

2693
01:44:16.52 --> 01:44:17.36
Like you're-

2694
01:44:17.36 --> 01:44:18.20
You can make that claim.

2695
01:44:18.20 --> 01:44:23.20
You don't have to sort of put explanations around that claim.

2696
01:44:24.56 --> 01:44:26.88
Bro, your face was so guilty when you said you read.

2697
01:44:26.88 --> 01:44:28.72
I was like, dude, please don't lie.

2698
01:44:28.72 --> 01:44:31.32
Well, I was trying to do the calculus

2699
01:44:31.32 --> 01:44:32.48
because that's a legitimate question.

2700
01:44:32.48 --> 01:44:34.64
Because if you say, oh, I'm working out, right?

2701
01:44:34.64 --> 01:44:35.96
But you haven't worked out in two weeks,

2702
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:37.36
you're like, bro, you're not working out.

2703
01:44:37.36 --> 01:44:39.32
You're currently not working out actually.

2704
01:44:39.32 --> 01:44:41.36
But if it's been like two days, that's like, okay,

2705
01:44:41.36 --> 01:44:43.28
you could have just been coming off a rest weekend

2706
01:44:43.28 --> 01:44:45.12
or something like this and you're still on the program,

2707
01:44:45.12 --> 01:44:46.84
so you're saying, we're working out.

2708
01:44:46.84 --> 01:44:48.52
So with reading, how is that?

2709
01:44:48.52 --> 01:44:49.60
I never thought about it.

2710
01:44:49.60 --> 01:44:52.88
So look, if I read last night before I went to bed

2711
01:44:52.88 --> 01:44:54.20
or something, easy, right?

2712
01:44:54.20 --> 01:44:55.04
I know the answer.

2713
01:44:55.04 --> 01:44:56.20
Oh, I'm reading this last night.

2714
01:44:56.20 --> 01:44:57.92
I was reading this, but let's face it.

2715
01:44:57.92 --> 01:44:58.92
It's been three weeks.

2716
01:44:58.92 --> 01:45:00.88
It's been three weeks.

2717
01:45:00.88 --> 01:45:02.72
So that was the guiltiness.

2718
01:45:02.72 --> 01:45:04.68
And three weeks is kind of a gift, isn't it?

2719
01:45:04.68 --> 01:45:05.52
Yeah.

2720
01:45:05.52 --> 01:45:06.36
Huh?

2721
01:45:06.36 --> 01:45:07.48
It, yeah, yeah.

2722
01:45:07.48 --> 01:45:08.40
I'm gonna agree with you.

2723
01:45:08.40 --> 01:45:09.48
It's kind of a gift.

2724
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:10.44
Yeah.

2725
01:45:10.44 --> 01:45:12.32
I'm giving you the opportunity to tell the truth.

2726
01:45:12.32 --> 01:45:13.84
Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean three weeks is a gift?

2727
01:45:13.84 --> 01:45:16.20
I'm saying me saying, oh, you were reading three weeks ago,

2728
01:45:16.20 --> 01:45:17.04
you were reading.

2729
01:45:17.04 --> 01:45:17.88
Oh, yeah, yeah, me.

2730
01:45:17.88 --> 01:45:19.56
It's kind of me being not generous.

2731
01:45:19.56 --> 01:45:20.64
Yeah, technically, I don't know.

2732
01:45:20.64 --> 01:45:24.36
I've never done the math and the technical evaluation,

2733
01:45:24.36 --> 01:45:25.44
but if you compare it to working out.

2734
01:45:25.44 --> 01:45:26.68
I hope you never get interrogated.

2735
01:45:26.68 --> 01:45:27.52
I know, right?

2736
01:45:27.52 --> 01:45:28.36
Me too.

2737
01:45:28.36 --> 01:45:29.20
I know.

2738
01:45:30.40 --> 01:45:31.60
If you compare it to working out,

2739
01:45:31.60 --> 01:45:32.60
then no, I'm not reading.

2740
01:45:32.60 --> 01:45:33.68
Currently not reading.

2741
01:45:33.68 --> 01:45:35.08
But here's the thing too though.

2742
01:45:35.08 --> 01:45:36.32
Did you already lift today?

2743
01:45:36.32 --> 01:45:37.56
No, not yet.

2744
01:45:37.56 --> 01:45:38.40
This afternoon?

2745
01:45:38.40 --> 01:45:39.72
Squats today, by the way.

2746
01:45:39.72 --> 01:45:41.04
Okay.

2747
01:45:41.04 --> 01:45:41.88
Either way.

2748
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:42.72
You got that mental prep going.

2749
01:45:42.72 --> 01:45:43.64
Yeah, a little bit.

2750
01:45:45.04 --> 01:45:46.96
But here's the thing about reading versus working out.

2751
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:49.56
You can pick up a book for like 10 minutes.

2752
01:45:49.56 --> 01:45:51.32
You can read three pages.

2753
01:45:51.32 --> 01:45:54.20
Working out, if I go do one, two sets of curls,

2754
01:45:54.20 --> 01:45:55.76
is that a workout?

2755
01:45:55.76 --> 01:45:56.72
I know it's BTN.

2756
01:45:56.72 --> 01:45:57.68
I know, I know.

2757
01:45:57.68 --> 01:46:00.000
BTN is better than nothing.

2758
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.80
Which is a non-philosophy in my opinion.

2759
01:46:01.80 --> 01:46:04.52
But, it's just my opinion.

2760
01:46:04.52 --> 01:46:05.36
How about this?

2761
01:46:05.36 --> 01:46:06.48
We'll use that philosophy very sparingly.

2762
01:46:06.48 --> 01:46:07.32
How about that?

2763
01:46:07.32 --> 01:46:08.52
All right.

2764
01:46:08.52 --> 01:46:10.08
But you see what I'm saying though.

2765
01:46:10.08 --> 01:46:12.84
Yes, you can read a short amount

2766
01:46:12.84 --> 01:46:16.000
and it still is providing legitimate benefits

2767
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.52
and progress.

2768
01:46:17.52 --> 01:46:20.36
Whereas two sets of curls,

2769
01:46:20.36 --> 01:46:23.52
while it is BTN, if you believe in that philosophy,

2770
01:46:23.52 --> 01:46:25.44
which Echo doesn't,

2771
01:46:25.44 --> 01:46:27.80
I would say, it truly is BTN.

2772
01:46:27.80 --> 01:46:28.84
It is better than nothing.

2773
01:46:28.84 --> 01:46:30.72
Yeah, but if I go two sets of curls

2774
01:46:30.72 --> 01:46:31.56
and then now I say,

2775
01:46:31.56 --> 01:46:33.68
you know what, that's gonna be my workout routine.

2776
01:46:33.68 --> 01:46:37.28
After about two months, it's kind of like an N.

2777
01:46:37.28 --> 01:46:38.12
Nothing.

2778
01:46:39.16 --> 01:46:40.000
I'm not speaking.

2779
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.64
So, okay, look.

2780
01:46:42.64 --> 01:46:43.56
We got to the bottom of it.

2781
01:46:43.56 --> 01:46:45.96
Thank you, Jaco, for your input.

2782
01:46:45.96 --> 01:46:47.04
We're hopefully reading.

2783
01:46:47.04 --> 01:46:48.08
We're hopefully working out.

2784
01:46:48.08 --> 01:46:49.80
We're hopefully improving ourselves

2785
01:46:49.80 --> 01:46:51.08
so we can deal with the world

2786
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:52.64
in a better way to make better decisions.

2787
01:46:52.64 --> 01:46:53.48
Right.

2788
01:46:53.48 --> 01:46:54.32
So get some JacoFuel.

2789
01:46:54.32 --> 01:46:55.88
Get yourself some more.

2790
01:46:55.88 --> 01:46:57.96
Get yourself some, hey,

2791
01:46:57.96 --> 01:47:01.56
this is, of all the things we're gonna say about JacoFuel,

2792
01:47:01.56 --> 01:47:05.96
the flavors of the Discipline Go drinks

2793
01:47:05.96 --> 01:47:10.32
have been radically upgraded.

2794
01:47:10.32 --> 01:47:13.16
They were based on my taste buds before.

2795
01:47:13.16 --> 01:47:15.24
My taste buds are not normal.

2796
01:47:15.24 --> 01:47:17.24
My taste buds weren't appropriate

2797
01:47:17.24 --> 01:47:19.84
to judge the taste of a drink for the world.

2798
01:47:19.84 --> 01:47:24.84
I had to run that through the leadership decision loop

2799
01:47:24.84 --> 01:47:29.84
and say, wait, my perspective on this is not correct.

2800
01:47:30.52 --> 01:47:32.32
Other people have a more,

2801
01:47:33.72 --> 01:47:35.80
a better palette for the job.

2802
01:47:35.80 --> 01:47:39.64
And we also want something that's more universally loved.

2803
01:47:39.64 --> 01:47:42.000
So we redid all the flavors.

2804
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.24
All the flavors are now awesome.

2805
01:47:43.24 --> 01:47:46.20
You may have had one flavor that you really liked before

2806
01:47:46.20 --> 01:47:47.64
and you might have had two that you just like,

2807
01:47:47.64 --> 01:47:48.48
these are gross.

2808
01:47:48.48 --> 01:47:49.84
They weren't down for you.

2809
01:47:49.84 --> 01:47:54.72
Now you will at least like all the flavors.

2810
01:47:54.72 --> 01:47:59.20
And there will be three and maybe five of them that you love.

2811
01:47:59.20 --> 01:48:00.80
Yeah, I would say that's probably true.

2812
01:48:00.80 --> 01:48:02.24
Totally redid them all.

2813
01:48:02.24 --> 01:48:03.36
They taste delicious.

2814
01:48:04.64 --> 01:48:07.44
If you tried them when they were based on my palette,

2815
01:48:07.44 --> 01:48:09.08
I apologize.

2816
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:11.48
I'm taking ownership of the fact that

2817
01:48:11.48 --> 01:48:14.16
I had a very sensitive palette to sweetness

2818
01:48:14.16 --> 01:48:15.36
and a little bit of sweetness

2819
01:48:15.36 --> 01:48:18.80
that tasted like sugarcane in my mouth.

2820
01:48:18.80 --> 01:48:20.28
And that wasn't the truth.

2821
01:48:20.28 --> 01:48:23.12
Besides this, you just drink water though,

2822
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:23.96
pre-deme for the most part.

2823
01:48:23.96 --> 01:48:24.80
That's what I'm saying.

2824
01:48:24.80 --> 01:48:26.12
That's why my palette was so jacked.

2825
01:48:26.12 --> 01:48:28.72
And recently I got on the water train.

2826
01:48:28.72 --> 01:48:32.16
So the only thing that I drink is water.

2827
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:36.80
Every once in a while, I'll have like a moke shake.

2828
01:48:36.80 --> 01:48:39.60
Actually I have that more, but even now,

2829
01:48:39.60 --> 01:48:41.000
everything is way sweeter.

2830
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.84
Everything.

2831
01:48:41.84 --> 01:48:43.000
If you just drink water.

2832
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.52
Before I have an occasional Gatorade here,

2833
01:48:45.52 --> 01:48:47.52
maybe some, you know, the kids got some orange juice.

2834
01:48:47.52 --> 01:48:49.64
Well, that's a good example too.

2835
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:54.64
Mango, I didn't like your mango flavor of Discipline Go.

2836
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Mango mayhem.

2837
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.20
And now it tastes really good.

2838
01:48:59.20 --> 01:49:02.52
It's still not my favorite of the group,

2839
01:49:02.52 --> 01:49:05.40
but I will definitely enjoy drinking it.

2840
01:49:05.40 --> 01:49:06.24
So we're good.

2841
01:49:06.24 --> 01:49:08.04
Yeah, I feel like we're good too.

2842
01:49:08.04 --> 01:49:08.96
So there you go.

2843
01:49:08.96 --> 01:49:11.64
Get out here and get you some of that.

2844
01:49:11.64 --> 01:49:14.52
Also, we got the Hunt Gear coming.

2845
01:49:14.52 --> 01:49:16.60
OriginUSA.com.

2846
01:49:16.60 --> 01:49:18.60
Get yourself some American made Hunt Gear.

2847
01:49:18.60 --> 01:49:21.44
And listen, that's just what we have to do

2848
01:49:21.44 --> 01:49:22.56
in the world right now.

2849
01:49:22.56 --> 01:49:24.08
Like I said, there's people that are stepping up.

2850
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:25.28
People that are not good.

2851
01:49:25.28 --> 01:49:26.40
And they're stepping up.

2852
01:49:26.40 --> 01:49:28.000
And they're trying to take over.

2853
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.60
And you don't need to necessarily pick up a rifle

2854
01:49:31.60 --> 01:49:33.28
to go to war.

2855
01:49:33.28 --> 01:49:35.60
But right now it's an economic war.

2856
01:49:35.60 --> 01:49:38.80
And if you pick up some OriginUSA gear,

2857
01:49:38.80 --> 01:49:40.68
it's gonna help us win the war.

2858
01:49:40.68 --> 01:49:42.12
So we don't have to fight a war.

2859
01:49:42.12 --> 01:49:43.12
That's the goal.

2860
01:49:43.12 --> 01:49:45.28
Let's be economically strong.

2861
01:49:45.28 --> 01:49:47.96
So go to OriginUSA.com, get a G.

2862
01:49:47.96 --> 01:49:49.88
Cause you should be trained in just in case

2863
01:49:49.88 --> 01:49:51.72
the war does come.

2864
01:49:51.72 --> 01:49:52.92
Get some Hunt Gear.

2865
01:49:53.88 --> 01:49:55.20
Just in case the war does come.

2866
01:49:55.20 --> 01:49:57.12
You can hunt the enemy.

2867
01:49:57.12 --> 01:50:00.28
But in the meantime, you can hunt deer, elk,

2868
01:50:00.28 --> 01:50:02.40
whatever else it is you wanna hunt.

2869
01:50:02.40 --> 01:50:04.24
Get yourself some of that.

2870
01:50:04.24 --> 01:50:05.28
Also, we have a store.

2871
01:50:05.28 --> 01:50:06.12
Don't we have a store?

2872
01:50:06.12 --> 01:50:06.96
We do.

2873
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:07.80
Okay.

2874
01:50:07.80 --> 01:50:08.64
What's that all about?

2875
01:50:08.64 --> 01:50:09.72
It's called Jaco Store.

2876
01:50:09.72 --> 01:50:12.56
You wanna represent, well, we're improving ourselves,

2877
01:50:12.56 --> 01:50:13.60
making good decisions.

2878
01:50:13.60 --> 01:50:16.88
You wanna represent discipline equals freedom.

2879
01:50:16.88 --> 01:50:19.12
Which is kind of the overarching kind of thing

2880
01:50:19.12 --> 01:50:20.60
for this whole thing.

2881
01:50:20.60 --> 01:50:22.20
More discipline, you are the more freedom you are.

2882
01:50:22.20 --> 01:50:24.000
Anyway, you wanna represent, we got some cool shirts

2883
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.76
and hats and hoodies and whatnot, some merch.

2884
01:50:26.76 --> 01:50:29.88
But it's better than just merch though, by the way.

2885
01:50:29.88 --> 01:50:32.88
A lot of thought and effort and careful,

2886
01:50:32.88 --> 01:50:36.08
meticulous consideration has been put

2887
01:50:36.08 --> 01:50:37.40
into all of these elements.

2888
01:50:37.40 --> 01:50:41.88
You should put that into every package that you send out.

2889
01:50:41.88 --> 01:50:44.28
Just let everybody know that careful time,

2890
01:50:44.28 --> 01:50:46.72
consideration has been put into this.

2891
01:50:46.72 --> 01:50:47.64
Oh yeah.

2892
01:50:47.64 --> 01:50:48.80
But and it's true.

2893
01:50:48.80 --> 01:50:50.76
There are many people, I wanna say many,

2894
01:50:50.76 --> 01:50:53.92
I mean for accountless people that have said these,

2895
01:50:53.92 --> 01:50:55.92
like this called the shirts and stuff like,

2896
01:50:55.92 --> 01:50:57.28
it's my favorite shirt.

2897
01:50:57.28 --> 01:50:59.32
What's the new shirt that you have on right now?

2898
01:50:59.32 --> 01:51:01.16
This is called the standard issue, right?

2899
01:51:01.16 --> 01:51:03.92
This one equals freedom, standard issue.

2900
01:51:03.92 --> 01:51:05.32
So it's a new one.

2901
01:51:05.32 --> 01:51:08.32
And there's multiple color ways.

2902
01:51:08.32 --> 01:51:09.16
Color ways, yeah.

2903
01:51:09.16 --> 01:51:13.32
You might recognize the colors and what they represent.

2904
01:51:13.32 --> 01:51:14.16
But if you don't, that's fine.

2905
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:15.08
There's a kinda layer there.

2906
01:51:15.08 --> 01:51:15.92
Yes, sir.

2907
01:51:15.92 --> 01:51:17.12
People need to figure out what the layers mean.

2908
01:51:17.12 --> 01:51:19.72
Yep, simple, but maybe not easy.

2909
01:51:19.72 --> 01:51:20.56
Kind of a thing.

2910
01:51:20.56 --> 01:51:21.88
I actually didn't figure out, you guys told me.

2911
01:51:21.88 --> 01:51:23.40
I may have figured out, if I would have

2912
01:51:23.40 --> 01:51:25.000
maybe seen them all at the same time

2913
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.56
and done a consideration, I might have figured it out.

2914
01:51:27.56 --> 01:51:29.84
But I didn't figure out, but also I looked at them

2915
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:30.68
for like three seconds, I was like,

2916
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:31.56
oh, you tell me, I'm freaking out.

2917
01:51:31.56 --> 01:51:32.88
Well, when you looked at the one,

2918
01:51:32.88 --> 01:51:34.12
you were like, that's what that is.

2919
01:51:34.12 --> 01:51:35.96
And then all you had to do is apply

2920
01:51:35.96 --> 01:51:37.36
that same thinking to all of them.

2921
01:51:37.36 --> 01:51:38.84
You'd be like, I see what's going on here.

2922
01:51:38.84 --> 01:51:41.28
But yeah, but either way, layers there for sure.

2923
01:51:41.28 --> 01:51:43.60
But if you don't know, layers doesn't even matter.

2924
01:51:43.60 --> 01:51:45.80
You just choose the color that you like or the colors.

2925
01:51:45.80 --> 01:51:47.60
And then if you do understand the layers,

2926
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:48.56
then it kinda matters too.

2927
01:51:48.56 --> 01:51:49.40
Yes, sir.

2928
01:51:49.40 --> 01:51:50.32
Doesn't matter if you don't get them,

2929
01:51:50.32 --> 01:51:52.000
but if you get them, it kinda does matter.

2930
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:52.84
Yeah, it does.

2931
01:51:52.84 --> 01:51:54.52
Let's face it, because if you listen, you know.

2932
01:51:54.52 --> 01:51:56.44
You know.

2933
01:51:56.44 --> 01:51:57.28
This is the way I see it.

2934
01:51:57.28 --> 01:52:00.92
This one is kinda like this, why we call it standard issue.

2935
01:52:00.92 --> 01:52:04.64
It's kinda like the main one we're positioning as,

2936
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:06.24
kinda the main discipline equals freedom.

2937
01:52:06.24 --> 01:52:07.96
The standard, if you have this one,

2938
01:52:07.96 --> 01:52:09.72
you're, that's the standard.

2939
01:52:09.72 --> 01:52:10.64
You have the standard issue.

2940
01:52:10.64 --> 01:52:11.48
Yeah.

2941
01:52:11.48 --> 01:52:13.44
Like if you don't have it, like,

2942
01:52:13.44 --> 01:52:15.20
are you even in the game or what?

2943
01:52:15.20 --> 01:52:17.80
I'm not saying you're not, but you see what I'm saying.

2944
01:52:17.80 --> 01:52:18.64
Here's the question.

2945
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:21.04
You don't have the standard issues, what I'm saying.

2946
01:52:21.04 --> 01:52:22.000
All right, there you go.

2947
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.80
So yeah, jockhostort.com.

2948
01:52:23.80 --> 01:52:24.64
We also have the short locker.

2949
01:52:24.64 --> 01:52:26.32
Don't forget about that subscription.

2950
01:52:26.32 --> 01:52:29.60
One shirt, a new shirt, one month, there.

2951
01:52:29.60 --> 01:52:30.84
New different designs.

2952
01:52:30.84 --> 01:52:33.76
Little bit more creative, I would say.

2953
01:52:33.76 --> 01:52:35.72
Those are pretty good ones coming out.

2954
01:52:35.72 --> 01:52:38.36
Yeah, you gave me a brief on the one that's coming out.

2955
01:52:38.36 --> 01:52:39.20
Yeah.

2956
01:52:39.20 --> 01:52:40.92
I'll say it's affirmative.

2957
01:52:40.92 --> 01:52:41.76
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2958
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:42.60
It's a good one.

2959
01:52:42.60 --> 01:52:44.12
Is that next, when's that, how far out is that?

2960
01:52:44.12 --> 01:52:47.96
Um, so August, September.

2961
01:52:47.96 --> 01:52:49.60
Oh, that's a good one for September.

2962
01:52:49.60 --> 01:52:50.44
All right, awesome.

2963
01:52:50.44 --> 01:52:51.92

to have our own platform to make sure

2970
01:53:01.72 --> 01:53:04.88
that whenever we get banned from this one,

2971
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:06.60
which could happen at any time,

2972
01:53:06.60 --> 01:53:07.88
or they might just say, hey, from now on,

2973
01:53:07.88 --> 01:53:09.20
when you listen to this podcast,

2974
01:53:09.20 --> 01:53:11.40
we're gonna insert our own advertisements in here.

2975
01:53:12.56 --> 01:53:15.12
So we don't like that.

2976
01:53:15.12 --> 01:53:16.52
That's why we made jockhostortground.com.

2977
01:53:16.52 --> 01:53:18.84
So if you wanna go there, subscribe to that.

2978

FlipsideCanvas.com to Kodemire.

2984
01:53:33.36 --> 01:53:35.76
I've written a bunch of books about leadership.

2985
01:53:35.76 --> 01:53:37.36
Check them out.

2986
01:53:37.36 --> 01:53:39.20
Only Cry for the Living by Holly.

2987
01:53:39.20 --> 01:53:42.12
Holly McKay, that's a jockal publishing.

2988
01:53:42.12 --> 01:53:43.08
She wrote that book.

2989
01:53:43.08 --> 01:53:46.04
She risked her life to go write that book.

2990
01:53:46.04 --> 01:53:48.48
So she's been on the podcast.

2991
01:53:48.48 --> 01:53:52.56
The book is insane to read and it will teach you

2992
01:53:52.56 --> 01:53:55.48
about the world and about evil in the world.

2993
01:53:55.48 --> 01:53:56.88
So check that out.

2994
01:53:56.88 --> 01:53:59.24
We also have Echelon Front, Leadership Consultancy.

2995
01:53:59.24 --> 01:54:00.20
Echelonfront.com.

2996
01:54:00.20 --> 01:54:02.80
If you wanna meet and come and talk to your company,

2997
01:54:02.80 --> 01:54:04.16
let us know.

2998
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:05.32
Echelonfront.com.

2999
01:54:05.32 --> 01:54:07.72
If you need help, we can help you.

3000
01:54:07.72 --> 01:54:10.80
If you wanna go to any events that I've been talking about,

3001
01:54:10.80 --> 01:54:14.08
things like the muster, things like the council,

3002
01:54:14.08 --> 01:54:18.20
things like EF Battlefield, just come and check those.

3003
01:54:18.20 --> 01:54:20.08
The next EF Battlefield is sold out,

3004
01:54:20.08 --> 01:54:23.000
but it's that little big horn looking forward to that.

3005
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.72
I think the next muster is in Atlanta,

3006
01:54:25.72 --> 01:54:28.08
Hot Lanna, October 12th to the 14th.

3007
01:54:29.28 --> 01:54:31.20
We sell out everything, so if you wanna come,

3008
01:54:31.20 --> 01:54:32.16
get there quick.

3009
01:54:32.16 --> 01:54:34.52
And also we have the online training academy.

3010
01:54:34.52 --> 01:54:37.08
I mentioned that a couple times today.

3011
01:54:37.08 --> 01:54:41.84
Teaching people how to lead in their life.

3012
01:54:41.84 --> 01:54:42.76
And a lot of times people think,

3013
01:54:42.76 --> 01:54:44.52
oh, I don't need to learn how to lead.

3014
01:54:44.52 --> 01:54:46.08
I'm only in charge of three people.

3015
01:54:46.08 --> 01:54:47.88
Or I don't even know how to lead

3016
01:54:47.88 --> 01:54:50.24
because I'm not even in charge of anyone.

3017
01:54:50.24 --> 01:54:51.08
Guess what?

3018
01:54:51.08 --> 01:54:51.92
You are in charge of someone.

3019
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:54.32
You're making decisions all the time.

3020
01:54:54.32 --> 01:54:55.68
You have a family.

3021
01:54:55.68 --> 01:54:57.56
You have peers that you need to lead.

3022
01:54:57.56 --> 01:54:58.92
You have to lead your boss.

3023
01:54:58.92 --> 01:55:00.12
I know that seems crazy.

3024
01:55:01.64 --> 01:55:04.88
So go to extrememownership.com.

3025
01:55:04.88 --> 01:55:09.40
If you want to get in on that online training.

3026
01:55:09.40 --> 01:55:10.56
Part of the reason we built that

3027
01:55:10.56 --> 01:55:12.84
is to make it more accessible to more people.

3028
01:55:12.84 --> 01:55:14.12
That's the mission of Eshalon Front,

3029
01:55:14.12 --> 01:55:16.48
to pass on the leadership lessons we learned.

3030
01:55:16.48 --> 01:55:21.48
And the Eshalon Front team can't get to everybody.

3031
01:55:22.28 --> 01:55:24.40
But now we can, extrememownership.com.

3032
01:55:24.40 --> 01:55:25.24
Go and check it out.

3033
01:55:25.24 --> 01:55:26.36
And if you want to help service members

3034
01:55:26.36 --> 01:55:28.44
act and retired, you want to help their families.

3035
01:55:28.44 --> 01:55:29.48
You want to help Gold Star families.

3036
01:55:29.48 --> 01:55:31.40
Check out Mark Lee's mom.

3037
01:55:31.40 --> 01:55:34.04
Mom and Lee, she's got an incredible charity organization

3038
01:55:34.04 --> 01:55:37.80
where she provides most of what she does.

3039
01:55:37.80 --> 01:55:39.56
She does a bunch of things.

3040
01:55:39.56 --> 01:55:41.72
I would say that the best thing that she does,

3041
01:55:41.72 --> 01:55:43.64
well, I don't say the best thing.

3042
01:55:43.64 --> 01:55:45.40
How can I say this?

3043
01:55:45.40 --> 01:55:48.24
One of the most impactful things that she does,

3044
01:55:48.24 --> 01:55:49.60
and she does a lot of impactful things,

3045
01:55:49.60 --> 01:55:54.60
is she provides medical help for veterans

3046
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.000
that is not provided for by the veterans administration.

3047
01:56:00.40 --> 01:56:03.40
So Hyperbaric Chamber is one of the primary things

3048
01:56:03.40 --> 01:56:06.12
she does to take someone that's having issues

3049
01:56:06.12 --> 01:56:09.52
and pay for them to go to a location

3050
01:56:09.52 --> 01:56:11.16
where they have a Hyperbaric Chamber,

3051
01:56:11.16 --> 01:56:13.12
put them on the right nutrition,

3052
01:56:13.12 --> 01:56:17.96
give them the right vitamins, get their health squared away

3053
01:56:17.96 --> 01:56:19.72
for 30 days, everything's paid for.

3054
01:56:20.72 --> 01:56:25.72
30 days of recovery from the impact of combat and trauma.

3055
01:56:26.64 --> 01:56:28.72
That's one of the things that she does.

3056
01:56:28.72 --> 01:56:33.80
So that's at americasmightywarriors.org.

3057
01:56:33.80 --> 01:56:34.92
So check that one out.

3058
01:56:34.92 --> 01:56:38.48
And then of course, I was talking about being on a horse today

3059
01:56:38.48 --> 01:56:41.60
and I'm a dude, meaning I'm not skilled,

3060
01:56:41.60 --> 01:56:46.12
but you can, when you're out there in the wilderness

3061
01:56:46.12 --> 01:56:47.88
and you're interacting with an animal

3062
01:56:48.72 --> 01:56:51.12
and you're in the open air,

3063
01:56:51.12 --> 01:56:55.08
it's a very positive thing

3064
01:56:55.08 --> 01:56:57.52
for your mental and physical health.

3065
01:56:57.52 --> 01:57:01.20
So Micah Fink, he has this thing called Heroes and Horses

3066
01:57:01.20 --> 01:57:03.36
at heroesandhorses.org.

3067
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:08.36
He takes veterans into the wilderness for 41 days

3068
01:57:08.36 --> 01:57:12.28
and it's horseback, it's camping,

3069
01:57:12.28 --> 01:57:14.80
it's staying out on the trail

3070
01:57:14.80 --> 01:57:18.36
and guys are coming back renewed

3071
01:57:18.36 --> 01:57:20.36
and reanimated for life.

3072
01:57:20.36 --> 01:57:22.64
So check out heroesandhorses.org.

3073
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:24.12
He's been on the podcast.

3074
01:57:24.12 --> 01:57:26.08
I'm sure we'll get him back on here again at some point,

3075
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:28.56
but he's got a great charity as does Mama Lee.

3076
01:57:28.56 --> 01:57:30.24
So check those things out if you wanna support.

3077
01:57:30.24 --> 01:57:32.20

3080
01:57:37.20 --> 01:57:38.32
I'm at Jocko'Winling.

3081
01:57:38.32 --> 01:57:39.60
Listen, and if you're gonna go on there,

3082
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:41.72
all I'm saying is be careful

3083
01:57:41.72 --> 01:57:43.36
because there's an algorithm that's looking to grab you

3084
01:57:43.36 --> 01:57:44.52
by the throat.

3085
01:57:44.52 --> 01:57:47.24
Don't let it be ready for it.

3086
01:57:47.24 --> 01:57:49.56
Don't let it run your life, get off your phone.

3087
01:57:50.84 --> 01:57:54.000
And of course, to all those military folks out there

3088
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.28
in the world that are making decisions every day

3089
01:57:58.28 --> 01:58:00.64
that provide us freedom and security.

3090
01:58:00.64 --> 01:58:03.32
Thank you for what you do.

3091
01:58:03.32 --> 01:58:06.72
And also thanks to police and law enforcement

3092
01:58:06.72 --> 01:58:08.44
and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs

3093
01:58:08.44 --> 01:58:09.92
and dispatchers and correctional officers

3094
01:58:09.92 --> 01:58:11.44
and border patrol and secret service

3095
01:58:11.44 --> 01:58:13.12
and all the first responders.

3096
01:58:13.12 --> 01:58:17.000
Thank you for protecting our freedom and security

3097
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:17.84
here at home.

3098
01:58:19.56 --> 01:58:24.04
And everyone else out there, life is all decisions.

3099
01:58:24.04 --> 01:58:26.16
And everything you do

3100
01:58:28.64 --> 01:58:30.96
is based on decisions that you make.

3101
01:58:32.52 --> 01:58:34.28
So think about the process.

3102
01:58:34.28 --> 01:58:37.32
And think about the amount of control

3103
01:58:37.32 --> 01:58:41.64
that these decisions give you over your own life.

3104
01:58:41.64 --> 01:58:44.60
And think about the impact that these decisions have

3105
01:58:44.60 --> 01:58:45.52
in your life.

3106
01:58:45.52 --> 01:58:47.36
So don't just let them happen.

3107
01:58:49.32 --> 01:58:50.20
Make them happen.

3108
01:58:51.52 --> 01:58:54.84
Make them happen by being aware of your decisions

3109
01:58:54.84 --> 01:58:58.20
and make them happen by having a protocol

3110
01:58:58.20 --> 01:59:01.76
so you make the right decisions to do the right things

3111
01:59:01.76 --> 01:59:04.68
so you can be a better leader, a better person

3112
01:59:05.80 --> 01:59:06.92
and lead a better life.

3113
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.68
And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco.

3114
01:59:11.68 --> 01:59:31.52
Ciao.
