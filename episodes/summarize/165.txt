Yeah, it's like you, it's like people, I mean, I don't know if I don't know the actual process, but you know how like, yeah, when you tense up before you do something, right? I'm like, oh, my gosh, like, your anxious and you just, like, the feeling beforehand is like way different than when right when he says start. When you heard that, you were like, you just sort of automatically like a zombie stand up and why not, like, you know, it was almost like, It's like I said earlier, like sometimes the leaders, if you got a good leader that's going to make things happen, it's going to make things happen. I think after like four to six months of like dealing with you and this stuff, it's like you became like a rule. And whether that's, you know, just completing a job, like it says, the desire to do a good job, or the desire to help other people, hey, the more money I get, the more I can give to other people, like these things are real, and they really drive. Oh yeah, and hand their more, like, they're longer lasting, like things to develop, you know, like when you develop them, they apply them more things. But if you're like, if you don't know, or you're like, what I'm losing it, I feel like I'm losing it right now. You can get recut, you know, so it's like, you're one of those guys, it has a huge, huge, surplus of standing by things that are like, look, you know, the most important part of working out is, as a representative, you don't grow. But nonetheless, I think, like when you go through, I remember there was a fire, but it was like way and a different building and it was just procedure, everyone, I evacuated, you know, kind of thing, and we found out it was just later or whatever. That's like, you know, in, in like a jujitsu tournament or whatever, like a competition situation. You know, like if you're, I don't know, you know, if you're about to go skydiving or something different for you obviously, but the normal person, for the jump out of an airplane, you know? Like if you didn't know you or her, like you'd be like, Bro, this girl's voice is weird. Yeah, that's true, because in picking a common enemy even on a social level whatever that like promotes cohesion within a group, like apparently from what I read is like gossip. So yes, I can be like, yeah, the recovery, that's how you, you know, get the gains, whatever, that's on one side, then the other side is like, wait, but you want to train a whole, there's way more to working out than just getting bigger and stronger. I forgot to tell you, like, you know, our friends are having a baby or something like this, you know? So I'm like looking at her like understanding that she has no idea that she can like dead live 8,000 pounds. Yeah, to accept, you know, this kind of, but like young adulthood, maybe like 23, 23ish. It's another thing when you, it's going to go into this, but when you are a leader and things are going bad, give people something to do, give them a direction, give them an order, say, look, are this what we are going to do right now? Oh, like the, you know, the, you know, I'm going to say the system running your 13 years old. Or if you get a couple of people making the same complaint and then another couple of people like kind of refuting it or something like that. Because like quitting, giving up like these are things that were kind of trained to think are bad. I don't know, I think I would think that'd be a little bit different, because almost like you run the risk of when it actually does happen and you smell smoke or see the smoke or see the flames or whatever, that might you do some added element that you weren't expecting. You like you ever, you know, when you're a kid or something, or whether you witnessed someone else do this or you do it where it's like, let's say you lost something. And I'm like, you know, one of these kind of like you. You know, those things, they, if you see them out of context, like if you watch a Gracie self defense video out of context, you'll say, well, it's going to be hard for that particular movie. But the reaches a point where kind of the, the boats like trying to push and then it gets on the, it's like in the water and then it gets kind of on the surface of the water. You got the most important job and the put to and commander, hey, this is your patrol, your the guy in charge, you're the got the most important job and the radio man, hey, radio man, if something goes sideways out there, it's you with your ability to communicate with air assets and other support elements that are going to save everyone. So it is, it's like a little balance, like a little dance you're doing with collaboration competition. I wonder why it's so like appealing for like a better term to blame other people. I want the point man to think hey, point man, if you don't know where you're going, everyone's lost. And on the last podcast we covered the early sections in the book about things like putting the right people in the right jobs, about the importance of training, about the best ways to teach and learn and how to become more efficient. Not that good, you know, if I'm going to take out the trash or something like this. But when you get a guy who's like so good at Jiu Jitsu, every once in a while like he'll end him in Maya would do this too. Think about the stark difference between those couple there who got one person that just wants to fight people or one person that feels like they've been a failure and everything and just has an opportunity to take that grudge against the world. Like when you, I would say maybe don't when I was like a teenager because I don't think I would have the capacity to write. She saw me and she's like, hey, and I was like, hey, we were working out. When you're in a leadership position, you're going to have people that are going to complain about things they're going to see problems. So all you have, I mean, and given what he's talking, you know, like nowadays, I've heard people use word pivot. I was like dang, that's like, this is brutal man. You might be like, well, I don't know how that's going to work. And win, I mean, here's the thing where worse, I think people get emotionally jammed up when they hear like, you're a competition. So I can be easily be like, hey, I don't feel like it today. It'll be like, I forgot to tell you, I got Billy coming over for you to work on, you know, yard, yeah, sprinkler. I take like, you know, in a meeting, I'm going to be working with a company.
