But I think, during the process of this book, and I talk about a little bit in the book, but it's often, you know, as a as a writer, I think it's an advantage because you're telling stories, and so it's almost cathodic, so people are telling you terrible things, and you have a way to release it out of your body, whereas I know a lot of my colleagues who have photographers or videographers sort of in combat, I think that they suffer more to be honest, and I've heard this from other journalists, because maybe they're not getting that same release that I get as a rasha, you know, may or may not be true, but that's sort of my experience with it, but I know, and I talk about in the book, and it's not always the most obvious things that I use the word break you, but it's not always, you know, digging up the mass graves, or seeing somebody be killed, or, you know, they're horrific things, but for me, they want the things that, you know, shattered me, the things were, and there's one that really sticks out for me, and that was in, in Xinjiang, in the city, and it had been completely destroyed, and a few of these very poor people had moved back to live in these houses where there was no water, no electricity, there was nothing, and because they couldn't afford to live at Camp Seven, and so I remember being there one day and there was a young father, and he had two young children, and he was just living in his old bummed-out house, even though there was nothing in there, and he said that he, they were easy, and he said that he's why I could be taking the children's mother, and that the captured her cold team and said if you give me X amount of dollars, it was several thousand dollars, then, you know, I would turn her, so this poor guy for months walked around and around the village, and everybody was trying to give him money, and he's selling his furniture, and, you know, doing whatever, and he finally comes up with the money, and then he calls the the captor and says, hey, I've got the money, and he says all of the prices doubled, and at that point, the man just gave up, he just gave up, he said, I can't, I don't have that, no one else was going to give me any more money, and so he's sitting over these kids, and I just, and that was the story that really, really cracks me because I felt so helpless, and I thought I can't even give you money, because I would be labeled as a, you know, giving, financing a terrorist regime if I did that, because they're paying ISIS to get their women back, but to him, that was, that was his wife, that was these children's mother, and just the fact that she's probably not even alive now, because he just could not come up with that money, and he didn't have the resources to do that. So I can go in and I can spend, however long I want to spend there months, weeks, whatever, and you get their stories, and you, you tell their stories, and then you get to go home, I get to get on a plane, I have an American passport, Australian passport, I go home, and they don't, they don't get to go home, they don't get to, they don't understand what, what that, that in itself being such a luxury, and there's a guilt that I, I feel with that sometimes, in just, in being that, and they don't view it that way, they view it as, why, you know, what a gift it is that someone would want to even come in and tell their story and would leave their comfortable home in their, you know, families and come and talk to us, and that's how they view it, which is lovely, but for me, it was always, yeah, a sense of of just filling a little bit of guilt about it, and I always tried not to be a vulture, I didn't want to go in and have somebody sort of open up and tell their story and then I, and then I take that story and I leave, and I don't know that it's ever, it's ever going to change anything for them, I don't know that it's ever going to do any good for them, so but I still I think about it a lot I think about you know a lot of the people that I meant and think you know I try to find out where they are what they're doing I think today with all these you know what's app signal encrypted messaging you stay in contact with these people a lot and that's something that a previous journalist and different generations didn't have so today which is lovely you can still sort of stay in contact with them and their families and but I found and currently what I'm currently on is the to do something hard like hard where your body has to be like hey we got to recover from this whether be like a one small body part situation even like a met concentration like that just at least one thing I like that on these kind of one-off days you a normal workout day as hard it's it's gonna be a hard one You'd be surprised how many people want to platform, you know, get them to talk and and often I think a lot of it came down to, they just hadn't talked to anyone for a while, so they were ready to talk to someone and they wanted to tell their story and you get them going for a minute and they're spilling their life to you because they've been locked up or whatever the situation is and people like to listen to themselves speak and that's what I've certainly found in interviewing a number of different jihadists and they want to talk. You know, I'm going to end and, and, um, as I read through the book, which I'm going to, I'm not going to do it justice because, you know, we're only going to read, obviously, not going to read the whole thing right now. well that's a probably a great place to wrap this up because what you've absolutely done in this book is you have told their stories and we will pass these stories on to as many people as we can and I think like Haley love said you know you've got what your talent is right you've got your skill in life and Haley love can make videos and sing and and you've got this ability to write and share these stories and that's what you've done so echo I heard about them and we went to sort of, we went for long drive to meet them and they were these extraordinary, easy women, most of them had come from Xinjar and, and so when, when I just came in in 2014, these, the easy, these had to flee up the mountain, because there wasn't anywhere to go, it was all surrounded at the bottom, and the tragedy of it was, so many of them died on that mountain because they stopped to death, it was a middle of summer and a rock in the summers, something else, but they stopped, and if they were describing, you know, having to throw children off the mountain, because that was going to be a better way for them to die than to, to die of stovation or dehydration, and that was really what's put in America to get back involved in Iraq was the Zidi plant, and the fact that of what happened to them was just in there was no, it was so hard to get aid and anything to them, so the women that survived that formed their own unit that they called the Sunlades, the first of the Sunlades, because they wanted to, I think, was multiple reasons, but they wanted to, to aid find their women that was still missing, and be they wanted to be involved in that in that liberation of getting their towns and villages back, and they were just really really extraordinary women. I remember when when I got back from my last deployment and then I retired and I you know we talked to guys and see stories about guys that would that guys that were in Vietnam more and they go back to Vietnam and then when I started doing the podcast we met guys that had gone back to Vietnam and I read more stories about guys that had gone back to Vietnam and then you know you can take it to the the guys that weren't World War II that would go back to the beaches of Normandy and and I remember thinking to myself as far as going back to Iraq especially when I first got home this is I don't want to go back there don't want to go back there And I think just, I guess by nature, you know, with a lot of journalists, whether they've had, you know, tremendous years behind them doing this or not, it's, I guess it's that same notion of, you know, we're not working for the government, we're not working for anyone in particular, you know, beyond our organizations. and I didn't there's there's plenty of stories in there where I know from being in combat myself how close you were to the front lines how close you how much danger you were in all the time so thank you for writing the book but also thank you for your courage and your bravery to go out there take these risks to capture these stories to capture the horrors of war so that hopefully we as a race of people in the world can learn to avoid it at all costs absolutely thank you Holly thank you thank you both and with that Holly has left the building and left us with an incredible book with some incredible accounts in it so definitely check out that book a lot of horror in that book a lot of horror in the world And then when I realized I really need to take a break was sort of several years after, and it was in Africa and East Africa, and I'd interviewed a woman from the Congo who had had, you know, sexual violence, and she'd had these babies out of rape, and just what she went through, was so horrific, and she'd been shunned by her community, and she was running, and she was just the most extraordinary woman, and she was so, the name was Nancy, and she was so strong and amazing, and I just remember sitting with her for hours and with these babies, and having that feeling of, oh my god, I don't, I don't even feel this, I don't, I don't feel anything right now, and that really bothered me that I didn't feel anything, and so after that trip I went home, and I, I didn't go anywhere, I don't think for about six or seven months, because I just felt that, yeah, if I'd got to that point of just not reacting, that was not the point that I wanted to get to, and that's when you just have to take a break, and that's it. But like you just, they be standing side by side with a native speaker, and, you know, my seal interpreter would say, hey, the local guy said this, and then the native speaker would say, hey, here's what he actually means, and there's just a little bit that you're just not going to catch, you know, it's just not going to happen. But then, if you're a doctor after a while, it becomes less of, oh, I'm cutting this person open more like this is like a, you know, like a specimen that I have to like work on kind of thing. There's a little bit of a Walmart process and I found in a couple of the situations where my fixes would get very angry and I would have to ask them to leave or, you know, because often, you know, it's their relatives, you know, people that are being killed by these people and they're hate is so strong. And what the other crazy thing is, you know, when you talk to people and, you know, I would explain, well, you know, we were working with often times of majority, she, uh, army and it would be hard for them to interact with the Sunnis and people have no, but they don't understand what we're talking about. but i wonder if you can find something that's not american made in the whole chain like if you go to one of the looms that they got could you find like a set of screws that are used in there you like hey those are made in you know somewhere you are going to be hard pressed to find something in your jeans that is not 100% American Yeah, I know that the locals' ability to understand and give you these nuanced things, you know, the interpreters that we had would, you know, because we'd have, we'd have Americans, like seals that had been trained to speak Arabic. so it's an awesome book and yeah check it out a lot of horror a lot of horror in the book a lot of horror in the world I kind of feel like we should do our best to bring some good in the world starting with our own lives trying to live a good life start there And that was a big bit, but you know, with ISIS, you know, you disband and, and entire, you know, the Sunnis were very dispensed and after a sedan and yet they still had their weapons in there out on the street and feeling, you know, persecuted by by the government Probably more than it seems like if you had the attitude like, I'm going to tell the truth and people are trying to adjust your stories and you're like, not not complying with what they want you to do. yeah it keeps your body there trying to you know to it trying to adapt adapt and get you know kind of rebuild itself as the new and improved version you know And I always felt very comfortable in the fixes and the people that I use locally that they had sort of the know how to at least, you know, with exit plans and other things like that. once well you need some supplementation for sure you need some supplementation in fact you got a little supplementation routine boom you're gonna be on the track even quicker faster more effectively the worries jockel has some supplementation jockel feel so here it is you need protein supplementation got milk tastes like a dessert by the way I've been on that train for about a almost a month now I forgot I forgot the joy the glory so actually going rewind just a little bit so all this stuff you can be on a subscription So, I had, I had set markers on you for myself really, especially because I was, you know, spending so much time in the stories, we'd just get heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and I would just be living in it, and I'd be living on a floor somewhere, and I didn't have a team, I didn't, I didn't have people around me beyond, you know, my fixes and who I was very close to, but I just knew that I, I wouldn't be able to do my work effectively if something, or I was hearing things that were really tragic, or something tragic had happened, and I didn't feel anything. but I found that if you sort of spread it out little bit more and I try to go hard to on every single day like hard at least one thing hard you know some people and I can't do anything really beyond that I think that was also something I had to learn was that you want to be able to think that a story is going to make a difference it's going to change the answer you know some law makers mind somewhere It's like she, she like, you always hear people going back to your roots, you know, go back to her, she straight up went back to her roots and she lives there now and pretty awesome. And I just thought, this is just, it's such a, it's a place beyond a place that I can, you know, thank goodness, can never imagine getting to, or hopefully never would, but the depths of what they'd endured, the thousands of people from their community that had been taken, and, and just, it was so hard to even now to wrap my head around, but for them, it was just, there would be on the point of even reacting to any of it anymore, and they were just so lost, and so, so broken by it all that I just, nothing was triggering them anymore, and so here was I feeling terribly unprofessional and crying, but I just, I, I couldn't, I just couldn't stop, and it was just, yeah, that was a, probably the only time I've really done that, but that was, yeah, And I remember just getting out of that being like, oh, I had, and I know of other journalists, I knew a couple of people and they, they got busted a checkpoints and turned around or turned in or whatever it was and, and for me that was going under the radar. so yes let's not let our lives and capabilities go to waste in any way let's try not to how about that I can't you know intention is a big deal it is just knowing these things that's a that's a huge start you know like I'm just saying if you forget like it's a little bit more can be more of a thing anyway check you got a subscription you don't have to even think about that kind of stuff also do you get like a discount or something you get a discount or Would you compare you know, like the doctors, like a surgeon or something like this and they got to cut some body open for you. For me it just became this sort of I was convinced everybody was tapping into my phone or and for me it was more of the I couldn't see this sort of enemy and that took me a while to kind of let go of that a little bit and to be like you know you're You know, and it's weird, you also talked about the, you know, at a point where you were in Africa, and you're interviewing this woman, and she's been through this absolutely unimaginable horror, and she's pressing on, by the way, and she's caring for it, and you feel like empty, and that's, you describe the Yazidis at many points, at many points of being in that zone where they just have no more emotions left because they've just gotten crushed at every single turn. and you know 99.9% of the time it doesn't change anything but doesn't make it any you know less important to do and be once you take that weight off your shoulders it's so much easier to do your job because again it's that clear mandate you know what it is that you're doing and everything else after that is out of your hands and not in the description And even when we, in Ramadi, when we got there in 2006, I thought we were just going to do a big sweep through like we did, like like the Marines did in Flusha. I got one more, maybe it's not the last one, but earlier in the book, there are some history lessons, like I said, even though most of the book is more just interviews with people and what you're actually saying, this is a little history lesson on March 17th, 1988, the morning after Saddam Hussein's bath party unleashed a tirade of chemical weapons and killed 5,000 Iraqi Kurds in the city of Hullab, Hullab. it does it's it's the people who who I mean what a privilege it is to to for these people to just to trust you enough with some of these stories to be that vulnerable with somebody that they don't know you know at least initially but I talked in length with one of the guards that was in the river at the time when she was telling me her story and you know, she sort of panning herself to be this very innocent person but as two sides to the story and the other side being that she was really evil and she was one of the people that was taking these easy women and helping facilitate them to be sold and debating them and things. Here's the weird thing about what you said about security is a low profile, 99% of the time is going to be better, no one's going to notice you, no one's going to care, but people freak out about us. but a lot of people it's gonna you she said you know their explosion happened here you know what I'm thinking And you know, that's what I think, you know, that's probably going to happen to somebody else, but not me. and I think she'd really settled into that kind of life of being able to, to be in, you know, with her people and to do things in a really different way than she did in visions. so you gotta keep these things in mind did you work out today if you're like oh wait did I work out you gotta know these can't stuff so I think I'm getting there with specifically with the city of Ramadi and it was really I mean obviously it was heart-wrenching to see that when Ramadi got taken over by ISIS and the the the block flag of ISIS flying over the government center which I know so many people had fought so hard to liberate that city and it was doing so well And I, you know, but what I always say and people think it's just it was the best training ground for what I ended up doing because you you learn to just to push yourself beyond any kind of boundary that you ever think. Yeah, you also mentioned in the book that at one point you felt like that, and then you kind of had to say, I'm a volunteer here, like I'm here because I want to be here, I can be sad, but they can't leave, this is it for them. it's bad how like like she'll describe each detail and it goes along with kind of what we've been saying a lot where it's like And then, at the end of it, you know, as I said, I was 21 and they said, well, sponsor you if you'd like to come in and work here full of time. You know you detail some of the stuff of the musul and you definitely talk about rock and insuria and I'm gonna fast forward and again I'm just gonna I have to otherwise I just hit here and read this entire book and I don't want to have you here forever but we get to a point where the cleanup is now happening and this is at the end of the book and the cleanup is happening in the musule and in this particular case there's cleanup happening in in Tallah Far. I think in the beginning, perhaps had a little bit more of a black and white perspective on it, especially in the US, we tend to sort of think which I think is completely wrong, but it always comes down to a religion thing. And it's just the approach that I take in life to try and figure something out because like to Jitsu, you know when you change a Jitsu and someone goes, oh, put your arm here and you're like, okay, and I said you know what two weeks after we get home we're gonna forget all those bad stuff just remember the good stuff and sure enough as time goes by you just remember the good stuff And so they said, well, we're building up a digital thing, you know, you obviously seem to like that kind of thing. So, once I think they get used to me a little bit and then, you know, I get used to them a little bit, then it can become a little bit more of a conversation after that. Oh, I'm going to be a drug dealer or I'm going to be a gangbanger because somebody's going to pay me, you know, to go and carry this from here to there. Then at some point it's going to make you angry and when you're angry enough, I also think it's a big factor for, for joining a lot of these groups to sort of rise up against their own governments and I think it's something that when I talked to officials about it, they'll often took quick to throw up their hands, we can't do anything about that. and so hopefully we can kind of take this philosophy and apply it to the our whole life hopefully same but here's a thing keep in mind we might need some supplementation from time to time you don't get you don't get nine hours asleep every single night you know you don't you don't max max molly nine hours because it's something everybody's different I'm slowly getting through that maybe because I don't have a lot of things I don't really like my memories of it a lot of them are great memories that's what makes me start you know I really at the time, you know, when you get to sit down for 20 minutes with Steven Spielberg or something, I don't think I really, you know, valued. When I look back at my life, my whole life, in my entire life, from the time I was born until like two days ago, I always think about all the things that I've done, where I look back and say, man, that wasn't too smart. And so I think people always, automatically assume that you must, yeah, that you must, you know, want to be this friend and everyone's kissing each other's ass on a red carpet.
