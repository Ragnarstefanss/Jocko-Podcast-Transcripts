[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 337 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.
[00:00:05] Good evening, Jockel.
[00:00:07] We had planned to take down an insurgent cell known to be located in three or four buildings
[00:00:14] in a village overrun with SUNY extremists.
[00:00:17] I was one of the four seals on the outskirts making sure the area was clear before establishing
[00:00:23] the command and control position.
[00:00:26] Suddenly, through my grainy green night vision goggles, I saw a family, a mom, a dad, a
[00:00:34] ten-year-old kid, and a baby sleeping outside a shack on a two-foot high platform.
[00:00:41] This wasn't entirely unusual given the middle of the night heat and I rack families off
[00:00:46] and slept outside.
[00:00:49] But something about this situation felt off to me.
[00:00:53] I saw the father start to reach for something.
[00:00:56] Instinct told me this was bad.
[00:00:58] I spoke firmly and clearly to the guy behind me calling his name, Joel, Joel, Joel, so he
[00:01:04] would know that I was about to make a move and cover me.
[00:01:10] And I held the Iraqi man in my crosshairs, ready to shoot him at any moment as I rushed
[00:01:15] as fast as I could toward him before he could grab what did turn out to be a weapon.
[00:01:23] He was reaching for an AK rifle, just as I put my foot on his arm so he wouldn't be able
[00:01:28] to point the weapon at me or any of my teammates.
[00:01:32] Then I quickly put my muzzle on his chest and subdued him and it listed Joel's help
[00:01:37] to properly detain him with flex cuffs.
[00:01:41] I could have shot him at any time.
[00:01:44] But as I first approached him, I didn't know for sure that he was armed and my instant
[00:01:49] and instinctive calculation made me confident that I would be fast enough to get him before
[00:01:54] he could take a shot at me or anyone else if he did have a weapon.
[00:02:00] It turned out that the AK was fully loaded and he had three magazines.
[00:02:06] And after we got him cuffed, his family under our control and our target secured, we
[00:02:11] realized through our interrogation process that he was in fact the number two most wanted
[00:02:16] enemy in Western Iraq at the time.
[00:02:23] So that right there is an excerpt from a book called Never Enough which was written
[00:02:31] by Mike Hayes who is a retired seal officer who served 20 years in the teams which included
[00:02:39] tours at team 4 team 8 team 10 and also a tour as the commanding officer of seal team
[00:02:47] 2.
[00:02:48] And it is career he deployed to South America, Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:02:54] He also served in the White House as part of the National Security Council under both
[00:03:00] George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
[00:03:04] I actually did serve with him for a short time in Germany when he was the operations officer
[00:03:12] and we are lucky enough to have him here with us tonight to discuss some of his experiences
[00:03:19] and lessons learned.
[00:03:21] Mike, thanks for joining us, man.
[00:03:23] Jocco, great to see you, brother.
[00:03:25] Great to be here.
[00:03:27] Yeah, we haven't hung out much since we were playing combat water polo in Germany.
[00:03:34] Which was circa 1998 and you were stationed at Unit 2.
[00:03:41] Were you the officer?
[00:03:42] I was the assistant officer but close enough.
[00:03:46] Okay, so you were the assistant, oh that's right, seal, exo.
[00:03:50] You were the assistant officer.
[00:03:52] So that you know that made me right as an engine.
[00:03:54] I was like the assistant assistant, the officer.
[00:03:57] So we would have these games, these water polo games.
[00:03:59] Did you actually play water polo?
[00:04:01] I didn't play in college but man alive combat water polo with you was one of my best memories.
[00:04:07] I obviously sucked at water polo but I was good at jiu-jitsu even then and I used to
[00:04:13] more for me it was more just water jiu-jitsu especially against the guys that actually
[00:04:18] could play water polo.
[00:04:20] The good and there were some guys that played water polo in college.
[00:04:23] I don't know if you remember that.
[00:04:25] Yeah.
[00:04:26] There were a couple guys that really needed to get taken out of the game or at least mitigated
[00:04:30] as much as possible.
[00:04:31] Yeah, I don't have either for people listening the rules.
[00:04:35] There's just really one rule.
[00:04:36] If you let go of the ball, you're supposed to let go of the person.
[00:04:40] So it was intense and I always did my best to be on your team.
[00:04:45] All right, all right, let's get right into it.
[00:04:50] Let's talk about you and let's talk about where you grew up.
[00:04:55] Where'd you grew up?
[00:04:56] You're in New England, right?
[00:04:57] Yeah, well dad was in an AV so bounced around a good bit but from ninth to ninth.
[00:05:00] Great on, ports with Rhode Island.
[00:05:02] What did your dad do in the Navy?
[00:05:03] He was a combination of submariner out of college and then supply officer.
[00:05:08] So kind of a joint career there.
[00:05:10] And how long did he do?
[00:05:11] He did 20 years, 23 years or something like that.
[00:05:14] Answer you were all over the place.
[00:05:16] I was until ninth grade.
[00:05:19] Where were you up until ninth grade?
[00:05:21] I lived in mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, Glam, you know, just a couple places around the
[00:05:27] US and then just really happy to set up.
[00:05:30] I was just a little down in ninth grade onward and call the biggest little state of Rhode
[00:05:33] Island home.
[00:05:35] How long you and Glam for?
[00:05:36] What grade?
[00:05:37] Seventh and eighth grade.
[00:05:38] Was that pretty bad?
[00:05:40] What year was this now?
[00:05:41] That was 83 to 85.
[00:05:43] So Glam was remote, a 83, 84.
[00:05:48] We get the Super Bowl mailed to us like four weeks after it happened.
[00:05:52] Because I went to Glam in 1992, 93 when they finally, when they started sending seals
[00:05:58] there on deployment and it was, I mean, you were not really connected.
[00:06:05] I mean, there's no internet or anything.
[00:06:06] So everything took a while to show up there.
[00:06:09] It was a very educational part of my growing up.
[00:06:14] You know, there's the simplicity.
[00:06:17] It was awesome, but at the same time, you definitely give up some of the amenities of modern
[00:06:23] life.
[00:06:24] Did you go to school out in town or did you go to school on base?
[00:06:26] Want to a private Catholic junior high school high school?
[00:06:30] Okay.
[00:06:31] Seventh and eighth grade.
[00:06:32] So you didn't get the crap beat out of you by the loaks?
[00:06:36] Oh, no, I did.
[00:06:37] Of course I did.
[00:06:41] I got a friend that was at S.D.V. in Hawaii, but he grew up in Hawaii.
[00:06:46] He was actually at Team 3 as well, but he said it was so, it was rough.
[00:06:49] Man, growing up, he was a highly kid in Hawaii.
[00:06:52] He said it was rough, man.
[00:06:53] Echo Charles commentary.
[00:06:54] Yes sir.
[00:06:55] Rough.
[00:06:56] Rough for the howly kids.
[00:06:57] I can't be a defense.
[00:06:58] It really depends.
[00:06:59] Well, this particular guy who's a great guy.
[00:07:04] Where I think he might have been claiming a lot of it had to do with him being howly.
[00:07:09] I think it may have also had to do with his mouth, which was rather large.
[00:07:14] That is typically the case.
[00:07:15] Yeah.
[00:07:16] Oh, classic.
[00:07:19] So you know, you mentioned that your dad was in the Navy, but you have a section here
[00:07:23] about your grandfather as well, and I'm just going to go to the book here and read this
[00:07:27] because it's a pretty awesome piece of history.
[00:07:29] You say, my grandfather graduated from the Naval Academy in 1940 and was nursing a hangover
[00:07:34] in a bungalow on the Pearl Harbor Naval Base, the morning of December 7, 1941, when the
[00:07:40] Japanese began bombing.
[00:07:43] He was with seven others at the time, and when he heard the first wave of something going
[00:07:47] on, he knew he needed to get in his Jeep and go toward the harbor back to his ship.
[00:07:53] One of the others would go with him.
[00:07:55] They all believed they were safe or where they were.
[00:07:58] He told me the scariest part was heading toward the ship, driving past the marine guarding
[00:08:02] the gate at 45 miles an hour without stopping, worrying the guard would shoot him.
[00:08:08] My grandfather made it to a ship and manned his battle station.
[00:08:11] He was on board that ship for the third wave of attacks and tended to many of the wounded
[00:08:15] that day.
[00:08:17] In the wake of the bombing, he realized that he didn't want to spend his career on the ground
[00:08:21] or at sea.
[00:08:23] He'd tell me this story.
[00:08:24] He would point up with the sky and say he wanted to be up there.
[00:08:29] He put in a transfer to become a pilot and after flight school as a World War II rage
[00:08:34] to cross the Pacific, he ended up stationed in the illusion islands doing long-range bombing
[00:08:39] missions from the outermost islands and helping to attack strategic sites in northern
[00:08:44] Japan.
[00:08:46] He took over as the commanding officer of his 35 plane bombing squadron at age 26 after
[00:08:53] his own commanding officer was shot down and he later served as a test pilot for the Navy's
[00:08:58] first helicopters and the commanding officer of the Navy's first helicopters squadron during
[00:09:03] the Korean War.
[00:09:05] He ended his career as a professor of naval science at Holy Cross and commanding officer
[00:09:09] of the school's ROTC training unit.
[00:09:13] He taught me about causes greater than self what it means to serve and how to keep pushing
[00:09:18] yourself to get better.
[00:09:22] No offense, bro.
[00:09:24] But if anyone should have written a book, it sounds like it would be the granddad.
[00:09:27] I agree.
[00:09:29] Larger than life.
[00:09:30] He's a real, like absolute hero.
[00:09:35] I was blessed to be able to grow up around a person that didn't say what do you want to be
[00:09:39] when you grow up.
[00:09:40] He would always say who do you want to be.
[00:09:43] There are a few of us on the nation and on the planet that know what it's like to set
[00:09:48] your personal desire and a suit aside and assume risk for the nation.
[00:09:52] I grew up with the stories of my grandfather who did that quite regularly and it was always
[00:09:57] inspirational and I'm really thankful it unquestionably made it in a delible mark on who I am.
[00:10:03] So he was the commander of the ROTC unit at Holy Cross.
[00:10:09] That's awesome to thank you had a guy that did all that.
[00:10:14] Did he fight in the Korean War when he was of a helicopter pilot?
[00:10:17] So he was actually here at North Island, California.
[00:10:21] As HU1 was the unit name and I just remember it because I can still see a lot of his
[00:10:26] plaques that he out in his walls which are almost memorized in my brain.
[00:10:31] But in Korea what the Navy would do is put a couple helicopters out on some of the frigates
[00:10:36] and the ships and then use that to go fly search and rescue.
[00:10:40] So he like those of us who in leadership positions in combat, he didn't have to get
[00:10:44] into the cockpit and go fly.
[00:10:46] Every time he went to visit the troops and there was something that happened, he said
[00:10:50] told the young JG to step aside and he was going to fly this one and I'll never forget
[00:10:55] one great story that he told from Korea about being shot at quite heavily going into
[00:11:02] rescue a pilot and just very calmly looking at his copilot and after this copilot was
[00:11:07] freaking out a bit and saying, sir there's shoot net us, shoot net us and of course I'm sure
[00:11:12] my grandfather just ice in his veins just sudson, we're at war, that's their paragative.
[00:11:21] I was on a go on an operation as my first deployment to Iraq and we're driving in a
[00:11:28] convoy and we're heading south of Baghdad and it was a long transit.
[00:11:31] We were going down the net job as a matter of fact.
[00:11:33] So it's a long haul, few hours, maybe like four or five hours.
[00:11:37] We get ambushed and a couple RPGs, some small arms firing, the RPGs missed us, one of them
[00:11:44] went over and I'm in vehicle two and it was a long convoy.
[00:11:47] We had some vehicle, another type of vehicle in the middle so we probably had six vehicles.
[00:11:52] So the and you know we're driving blackout and it's at night and we so we get so my vehicle
[00:11:59] we make it, nothing happens to us at all and then we see I the first thing I saw was
[00:12:05] I was looking kind of outboard and I just see an explosion which the first thing that I saw
[00:12:10] I saw a couple of tracers but then I saw an explosion which was an RPG that went high and then
[00:12:14] another one went low and we just you know kept driving.
[00:12:19] I think I think you know pushed through is the typical call whenever and then by the tune
[00:12:26] chief who's a freak a great guy but he was in vehicle six so he's the one that got to like
[00:12:31] watch the RPGs near missing all this stuff and he comes up on the radio and he
[00:12:35] goes he's like hey sir you we just got ambushed back here we took smart PG and some had some
[00:12:42] it's freaking small arms and I came up on the radio and I went Roger and he got a big kick out of
[00:12:49] that maybe I should have been more understanding at the time but yeah got to try and stay calm.
[00:12:57] Sometimes empathy works and sometimes it doesn't right?
[00:12:59] So you're growing up you do your high school years in Rhode Island what sports were you doing?
[00:13:07] Did you play sports? Yeah you saw Krabaskyball baseball you know was very you know average at all
[00:13:12] three in a town that was or in a state that wasn't exactly competitive either so.
[00:13:18] That's that's a harsh statement about poor old road highway.
[00:13:23] And so you're just a decent athlete I mean how tall are you?
[00:13:26] Six four and you didn't play did you where you go to basketball?
[00:13:29] I was you know I was decent but in college all my friends were on the varsity team and I was like man
[00:13:34] I can't hold a candle to these guys and what about grades were you studying hard?
[00:13:38] I was a good student in high school.
[00:13:41] Were you what kind of music were you listening to? Oh gosh wow that's a great question so mid 80s
[00:13:46] I was like you know rush a little quiet riot maybe what else would that have been you know
[00:13:52] that that that that pretty much dates it you'd quiet riot.
[00:13:57] Was that come on field in the ways?
[00:13:59] Is that and why and or is that twisted sister?
[00:14:02] Man that's not my hair metal bands and then since your
[00:14:07] since your grandfather worked at Holy Cross you went to Holy Cross was that pre pre or damed or how
[00:14:14] that happened my family has a long history with Holy Cross my great grandfather is in the varsity
[00:14:18] Hall of Fame class in 1910 and and so you know my grandfather there's a lot of relatives who
[00:14:26] have been there so no one ever pushed the navy or Holy Cross or anything on me it was more of just
[00:14:31] a hayson here's what's out there there's this thing called a four year ROTC scholarship and
[00:14:37] you know I just love for you to be familiar with it and you know I'll never forget my grandfather
[00:14:43] and dad put me in the car like summer of junior year in high school and driving me up to
[00:14:47] Holy Cross and and actually meeting the major who is in charge of the unit at the time and
[00:14:53] that was a guy who to this day is a great friend of mine Joe Dunford later became the chairman of
[00:14:58] the joint chiefs' staff so you know Holy Cross has as a as a story to institution with a lot of
[00:15:03] history and I was it was a no-brainer for me. Then you show up there and you're instantly you're
[00:15:10] you're you take an ROTC scholarship out of the gate I do you know they're paying for college
[00:15:14] everything that's pretty good deal yeah at the time I was just thinking to myself as the oldest of four
[00:15:20] this is a great chance to not burn any cash and save money from my younger three siblings to be able
[00:15:25] to go to college and you know it's it I thought I'd do four years of some sort of a supply officer
[00:15:30] and get out or you know be have great leadership experience for four years and then you recall we
[00:15:35] invaded Panama in 89 there was a guy named John Conner's who was killed on the Patea Runway.
[00:15:40] John was a Worcester poly tech graduate but Holy Cross ROTC so my first exposure to the seal teams
[00:15:47] was the memorial service in the chapel at Holy Cross where the the seal community came together
[00:15:52] and remembered John Conner's and that left it real mark on me but freshman year dude I was
[00:15:58] six four and I don't know about 105 pounds I'm not an auditor but I was there was no way at that age
[00:16:03] I even thought about myself being capable of going through seal training but then later on as the
[00:16:08] years progressed and I I went from one pushups to one and a half or something like that you know then
[00:16:12] then I I I went to many buds and then became was was that your first sort of knowledge of the
[00:16:19] seal teams yeah first was when Panama happened yeah because Panama definitely influenced me as well
[00:16:25] because I fought to myself wait there's a war going on as far as I was concerned there's a war going on
[00:16:31] and I was thinking to myself how is this happening and I'm not there and how do I get there
[00:16:37] ASAP and that's why I do in the Navy well you know for me it was not what went through my head at that time
[00:16:45] for me it was more of like a beef come familiar with it and said it aside for a couple years and you know
[00:16:50] an ROTC you spend a week in the summer with the pilot it's a week with the you know the submariners
[00:16:55] and the surface guys and you try to figure out what do you want to be when you grow up and you know
[00:16:59] I had a great aviation crew as I flew in an A6 off of the USS Saratoga and it was right after top
[00:17:04] gun came out so there's like 92 issue or something and I was like you know partying like a rock star
[00:17:08] and thought I'm gonna go be a pilot this is freaking awesome then I went to three weeks of many
[00:17:12] buds and became perversely attracted with that challenge is so holy cross have you ever been
[00:17:18] a Notre Dame before I have you know so Notre Dame I've been there a few times and it you know like
[00:17:25] the females aren't allowed in the male dorms and you have for the if they are they got to be out of
[00:17:30] there by 10 o'clock at night like it's pretty strict from a college aged person perspective it's
[00:17:36] holy cross like that as well it's not as strict the there were you know at this point maybe
[00:17:41] I'm gonna guess roughly 10 or 15 Jesuit priests on as as professors when I was in college it's
[00:17:47] less now but you know there was some that would would go out and enjoy a glass of wine or more
[00:17:53] for but they disappear around 10 o'clock at night and but it was it was a it was there's a great
[00:17:58] relationship between you know the the student body and the faculty so now you're saying that you did
[00:18:04] summer cruises and for those people that don't know this is when you're going to college you're in
[00:18:09] ROTC the Navy will take young college kids and send them out to get a little taste of the different
[00:18:16] parts of the Navy so did you do a ship one just a straight-up ship or do I did for a day
[00:18:21] and I was like this ain't me you know so uh that's all it took on the war that wasn't hard
[00:18:26] we did you we did you actually go like on to a ship somewhere that was on deployment or what was that
[00:18:31] you know I think what we did was got helicopter from Norfolk over to some frigate for 36 hours or something
[00:18:38] it was thank God it wasn't longer and then what and then what year was that after your first year
[00:18:43] 91-nish 92-ish yeah then when did you do the pilot thing what year was between junior and senior year
[00:18:49] okay so in between your junior year senior junior year and your senior year you get the full on
[00:18:54] top gun experience I did and then the full on buds and experience after that so that was
[00:19:01] in the same summer same summer that was an optional three week thing and I thought you know in order
[00:19:05] to really figure out do I want to be a pilot or do I want to be a seal I've got to go do this many
[00:19:08] buds thing and they took 32 kids out of college for that program what year was the mini buds
[00:19:14] it was the summer of 92 so you show up to mini buds and what are they doing this is three weeks long
[00:19:21] it was a legit they they legit three week one week of each other three phases of training and
[00:19:26] you know when you're going through it you're like how does this compare with the real thing
[00:19:30] it was after going through the real thing I look back and say we got a legit full treatment for each of
[00:19:36] the three weeks and I think nowadays they use that sort of it's called something else now I think
[00:19:41] it's called seal officer assessment and selection and it's it's something like mini buds but
[00:19:47] it's sort of the selection and how they're going to figure out who gets to go was it like that
[00:19:51] for for you guys I they definitely was we came out with like grades out of the 32 you know like
[00:19:58] not grades as an academic but like just an all around score of how you did and and you know
[00:20:03] I remember having a pretty high number and thought I think I'll be probably this will stand
[00:20:08] me pretty well if I applied to to circle back and go to buds and history has it I did and they took
[00:20:13] 16 guys out of ROTC my year 16 guys out of the academy so there are 32 officers taken into the
[00:20:19] program and as you know I don't know the number maybe 15 of those made it through ultimately or
[00:20:23] something like that there's only quid quitters and mini buds oh yeah there was fun it's just like
[00:20:30] okay don't let the door hit you the asshole the way out you know and so this is now 1993 that you
[00:20:36] graduate from Holy Cross and you get your you get selected I mean the selection process for officers
[00:20:44] now is totally insane I mean it's insane back then but with all the hype around seals and all that
[00:20:50] it's just ridiculous but still taken 16 from ROTC and 16 from the Naval Academy that's slim pickins
[00:20:59] it was tough and the hard thing as a rising senior in needing to make a life decision was that
[00:21:04] I knew that if I applied for buds I would not get my number two choice of pilot because
[00:21:09] once you work through and they take the washouts who they don't pick for seal training all the pilot slots
[00:21:15] are gone so it was a little bit of a gamble a lot of a gamble but like anything in life go for what you want
[00:21:21] and then you would have been on that ship that you didn't write very much and then you show up
[00:21:27] to what what buds cost for you 192 so you show up for buds class 192 how prepared were you you think
[00:21:34] I was very prepared I wasn't far from the most gifted physical athlete you know I
[00:21:40] I mean friends that did you know showed up and did 50 pull ups and I you know struggle with my you know
[00:21:44] eight and a quarter you know it was like that but you know 64 230 at a time I like all I ran real fast
[00:21:50] because it's one like a fish the O course was no trouble for me pull ups where my my downfall but you know
[00:21:55] I came in feeling pretty strong was there any was there anything that really challenged you
[00:22:02] for me it really was the pull ups it but never to the point where I wasn't a joke around about
[00:22:09] the eight and a quarter but I just you know I just I was there for reason you know if
[00:22:14] if something's worth doing it's worth overdoing and I prepared as well as I could and I just took
[00:22:19] it really seriously when I went through and kind of limited my my drinking when I was going through
[00:22:24] buds at age 21 everybody's drinking like a fish I was pretty serious about recovery and and
[00:22:29] just knew I needed every advantage I could possibly help myself with when I went through
[00:22:35] about that and leave the barracks really yeah like I was a total nerd I would sharpen my knife
[00:22:40] and polish my boots like all weekend long and I didn't even think about the recovery aspect I think
[00:22:46] that's a new thing like the idea of recovery I don't know I didn't really have that I didn't really
[00:22:51] think of that you didn't have guys walking around with those big jug the gallon jugs of water
[00:22:55] like that that that was the thing in our our time just pump the fluids after the after the
[00:23:00] day and for the weekend yeah I didn't really have too much of that now I've always thought that if you
[00:23:04] were if you couldn't do pull ups you're gonna have a problem with the O course and it seems like
[00:23:10] you had problems with Paul so you still didn't have a problem with the O course too and I'm I honestly
[00:23:15] I flew through though I was always top five in the of course and you socked it pull ups that's
[00:23:20] really bizarre I mean it's just a different type of strength pulling just a little bit
[00:23:26] laterally sometimes you know it's just that dead overhead up and down for pull ups is a little
[00:23:30] different than like rope climb where you're at that a little bit of an angle how were you good at
[00:23:34] rope climbs too yeah yeah it's really good that's we must just have some weird genetic anomaly where
[00:23:40] pull ups are hard because that's crazy right to be able to do their O course in a top five position
[00:23:45] and be socket pull ups that seems crazy yeah I mean I can't explain it I could just tell you what
[00:23:51] I experienced yeah well the cool thing about sucking at pull ups is you probably won't fail
[00:23:57] buds because you socket pull ups right you can fail you can get drop from buds for running you
[00:24:01] can drop get drop from buds from swimming you can get drop from buds for the O course but for
[00:24:05] pull ups you might get you know T is basically by the instructors during a PT but yeah no it's
[00:24:12] you're not going to get dropped yeah no it's it's very true it's very true how many how many people
[00:24:20] quit how many did you start with how many people quit we started with 120 and 19 graduated
[00:24:27] started with 120 and 19 graduated what were you did anybody quit that you were like dang what
[00:24:34] how's that oh hell yeah you know you you got guys that look like you walking on on day one
[00:24:40] and you're like man what am I doing here but you know guys just drop like flies and you know my
[00:24:48] you remember in the beginning they they assigned swim buddies you just throw people in the pool and
[00:24:51] go swim you know a mile or half mile I can't remember what you was but it was just swim as fast as
[00:24:57] you can and with 120 guys in the pool you're crawling all over each other and just doing and then they
[00:25:01] just pair up you know number one and number two or swim pair one number three and number four or
[00:25:05] swim pair two and so on so myself and Chris Cassidy were swim pair one and so Chris and I like
[00:25:10] life long friends from you know day one of Buds and and the two of us just we're always had this
[00:25:16] fun healthy sense of talking trash at each other and you know he ended up as the honor man for the
[00:25:23] class and I I years later went back to Buds and I told him that I pulled all the records and
[00:25:28] recalculated the math and at this point he was an astronaut of course you know and and I said hey I
[00:25:32] just got some bad news for you I'm having your name taken off the plaque and my name's going up
[00:25:38] so so but nothing really challenged you made it through one shot one shot I know honestly no major injuries
[00:25:43] or anything like that it was like that or nothing so I really can honestly say I never thought about
[00:25:48] quitting and I never it was hard just like the rest of us but just power straight through yeah
[00:25:54] so then you get assigned to so it's now 1994 and 94 and you get to assign to team four
[00:26:00] did you speak did you speak Spanish prior to that I was almost a double major in Spanish so good
[00:26:06] good in the books but never real at that point in life not a lot of practical Spanish because that was
[00:26:13] when we were coming up if you spoke Spanish you were going to team four pretty much guaranteed
[00:26:19] so being a new guy at the team and I have a good new guy story from your book here
[00:26:24] and we'll go to the book it says another story again from my time as a brand new seal
[00:26:30] the Navy needed four of us to test out some new equipment I was volunteers to take part in the
[00:26:36] exercise they took us in a boat two or three miles offshore dropped us in the water and told us to
[00:26:42] swim to the beach stay for a few minutes and then swim back to the boat together it turned out
[00:26:47] that conditions were unexpectedly harsh 40 knot winds nearly eight foot high waves and the four of us
[00:26:53] immediately lost each other unable to see more than a few feet in front of us man that's scary
[00:27:00] in its own right I swam for what felt like hours before I finally got to the beach and once I was there
[00:27:06] I could not see my teammates I waited and waited but there was simply no sign of them
[00:27:12] I figured maybe I'd miss them maybe I'd gotten slowed down by the waves maybe they'd already
[00:27:16] made their way back so I got back in the water and tried to return to the boat even though I couldn't
[00:27:21] see it in my mind I had to complete the assigned mission at all costs just keep going this is what a
[00:27:27] seal has to do I couldn't find my way back to the boat because the harsh conditions I was using
[00:27:33] myself a range of compass to do my best to swim a straight line of bearing to the planned link up point
[00:27:39] but it didn't work I realized I must have drifted much more than I expected I couldn't see
[00:27:45] back to the beach either for a few hours I was basically lost at sea worrying the other three more
[00:27:51] experience seals would think I was a total screw up I'd broken a fin strap and at one point I was
[00:27:57] startled okay scared when I was moved about 10 feet in the water bumped hard by a massive sea mammal
[00:28:05] I imagine that no one would ever find my body and everyone in the seals would think I must not
[00:28:09] a bit been a good swimmer despite entering buds training with one of the fastest swim times in the
[00:28:14] history the program and along with my swim buddy Chris Cassidy coming seconds away from the fastest
[00:28:20] ever two mile swim in buds finally the boat found me and picked me up and I was quickly
[00:28:27] exerated for being stupid enough to make the swim back out to sea my three teammates had ended
[00:28:35] up down the beach from where the current had taken me just a bit too far away from me to see them
[00:28:41] and they stayed on the beach until the boat came for them knowing conditions were too miserable
[00:28:45] to even attempt to head back I'd put myself at risk for a training exercise because I can
[00:28:51] fuse doing the hard thing with doing the right thing my decision was far too risky to make
[00:28:56] sense even as a confident and capable swimmer there's so many little lessons in that one right
[00:29:02] there that little story and by the way so your book is filled with a bunch of lessons and obviously I'm
[00:29:06] just reading excerpts from it and this chapter was choosing the hard path and doing the hard thing
[00:29:13] and of course everything's a dichotomy and you can do things where you go too hard but I can't
[00:29:20] even imagine you with your silver ranger which is for those of you that don't know it's a little
[00:29:24] compass that used to navigate on the land and you they you probably had it with you for like E&D or
[00:29:29] some whatever and you actually pulled this thing out you're trying to swim a bearing which is literally
[00:29:35] impossible to do my distance totally ridiculous and what I what I love about this is this is so true
[00:29:42] the main thing you're worried about you're lost at sea for hours you're getting pushed around
[00:29:46] by sea animals the main thing you're worried about is looking like a loser for you to keep it
[00:29:52] if you bad team guy that's exactly right you know I still vividly remember being you know
[00:29:58] pushed this you know eight or ten feet or so in the water and just thinking okay this is going to
[00:30:02] be the end but the worst thing is people are just gonna think I was a terrible swimmer and it's just
[00:30:07] not what you want stop and look you want I'm like no I'm a good swimmer please don't think that you know
[00:30:12] so yeah there's a million lessons in there you know it's you know this well when you when you're
[00:30:15] right a book if you if you if you're the president of your own fan club by definition you don't have
[00:30:20] a book you know and and so sharing these things where we you know that didn't make good decisions or
[00:30:27] or in retrospect we're we're actually stupid I think that's where the learning is and that's what I try
[00:30:31] to do in the book you you as a new guy meaning this is the universal you me you all of us as new
[00:30:38] guys pet you do some dumb dumb things and this is a classic example of like this is all the other
[00:30:47] guys that were experienced like hey we're not swimming back out are you kidding me well all
[00:30:50] die and you of course hey that's what the mission is we're gonna go and do it well a little bit
[00:30:56] too it's an interesting thing I'd be interested in your perspective on this but you know
[00:31:00] growing up in the teams before 9-11 it was mission mission mission at all costs post 9-11 our
[00:31:07] community got much better at saying you know what there's new information let's incorporate new
[00:31:12] information what's going on let's think about risk is the risk worth the reward and constantly
[00:31:17] reassessing that risk you know it's it's uh it became okay to turn around on a mission in our
[00:31:23] raccara Afghanistan and say hey you know what the risk profile just change massively we'll come back
[00:31:27] another right for these this group of terrorists there's this risk is not worth assuming and let's
[00:31:31] not do the mission and and when I was growing up and when you were growing up we'd be
[00:31:35] excoriated for not doing the mission yeah later on we were held up as smart yeah um well there's
[00:31:42] there's a big difference you know when we were coming up before the war started we were literally
[00:31:47] training for the big mission singular like hey you're gonna do this one mission we didn't know what it
[00:31:53] was but that's what we were training for and yeah there was no way it didn't even seem like a
[00:31:58] feasible idea that you would turn around on a mission or not complete the mission and then yeah obviously
[00:32:05] as the war kicked off and once we started to get combat experience for our generation it was like oh
[00:32:10] this doesn't make any sense oh the risk is too high oh the enemy has what we're not going to
[00:32:14] get them then and yeah uh that's something that we had to learn just as our forefathers had to
[00:32:20] learn and it's unfortunately one of those lessons that it it's almost like we well we had to
[00:32:26] relearn it you know uh I wrote about this in leadership strategy in tactics we used to set up
[00:32:30] this training scenario in in Mount or South where everyone would call it the urban training where
[00:32:37] the guys would be clearing like down a building down a hallway and there'd be we'd have a
[00:32:41] barricaded shooter at the end of the hallway and everybody that ended the hallway would get riddled
[00:32:45] with paintball and get put down and you'd see unfortunately just about every leader would fall victim
[00:32:53] this two more guys go they get mode down two more guys go they get mode down two more guys go they
[00:32:57] get mode down and and then you know finally after you know three quarters of the tasking is laying
[00:33:02] dead in the hallway we'd say hey man take a step back and think about what's happening what are you
[00:33:06] doing it does this make any sense and they would have that's what they have to do is they'd have to
[00:33:11] learn to detach and take a step back and go oh this is obviously bad and I shouldn't continue to do
[00:33:16] this so yeah that's definitely a lesson that we learned and that we had then to pass on to the
[00:33:23] next generation of seals to to make sure they understand that quitting is an option and you know
[00:33:31] you don't quit from a strategic perspective but with whatever tactic I'm using right now is
[00:33:35] going to cost us lives or get people killed or doesn't make any sense I got no problem saying
[00:33:39] up I was wrong this is bad move we're not doing it anymore totally agree and it's a lot of
[00:33:44] people ask me how does your business career now that have been retired for ten years and help
[00:33:49] run the operations for VMware really large software company the applicability is the exact same
[00:33:58] it's hey we have a certain amount of you know capital to invest do we invest it in in place
[00:34:03] a or place b or c and and and wait a minute you know what we're getting feedback from the market that
[00:34:08] that our original choice wasn't quite right are you going to keep trying to invest your way through
[00:34:12] and throw bad money after a good money after bad a bad path no you're going to make a decision
[00:34:16] some costs or some let's go try something different and and quickly dynamically assess and so
[00:34:21] the parallels between business and the seals are and the military writ larger are really really
[00:34:27] perfect yeah I often end up talking to companies and that's the exact example all uses
[00:34:33] hey we tried this marketing campaign it's not we're not getting the ROI we expected let's put
[00:34:39] more money into it okay and they still don't get the ROI we're expected okay let's put even more
[00:34:43] money it's the same thing as sending guys down the hallway to get shot up awesome so
[00:34:50] you so you get to team four that's kind of an example of team four what else was going on a team
[00:34:56] four when you got there do you get you get put right into a pollton I was relatively quick and maybe
[00:35:02] six months or so of kind of like schools and individual time but yeah did you go to so you
[00:35:07] went through STT at the team or was it at the team okay so your team is running STT was at a good
[00:35:13] course of instruction it was it was good you don't know what you don't know if that age and that
[00:35:18] that time in life you know but everything was learning at that point learning what to do sometimes
[00:35:24] learning what not to do you know we we but a immediate exposure to what was going on I remember
[00:35:31] in demolition training being at four AP Hill one range over from us there were four Marines that
[00:35:38] were in a demolition accident and basically vaporized and it was terrible and so what was the
[00:35:44] accident there was something called a Meekleek charge it was like a line charge and these it
[00:35:49] went low order and they you know collected all the C4 and put it in a pile and then went to
[00:35:53] burn it but forgot that there was this little thing called a booster in the C4 and so when they
[00:35:59] went because you can burn C4 as everybody as as you know but not everybody necessarily does and
[00:36:04] in that cause it to go high order and so you know right away we're exposed to you know real
[00:36:10] situations and so lots of like like you know a lot of the the biggest learning comes from the
[00:36:16] hardest situations what uh what schools did you go to as a new guy officer well you know it's funny
[00:36:23] one of my greatest friends in life war in Nicarcin was the operations chief and as a brand new
[00:36:27] incident I remember walking in and saying all right chief Nick the only question I have is do I
[00:36:30] go to free fall and then sniper or sniper then free fall and he's like shut up new guy you got
[00:36:35] some dog and ponies for you so you know so I was you know hitting the road doing you know dog and
[00:36:40] pony shows and all kinds of stuff but you know I went to you know the time it wasn't like you could
[00:36:45] get right into free fall school so it took me three or four years to be able to get there and so I
[00:36:49] I don't even my schools were so unremarkable at that time that I don't even remember what they were
[00:36:53] yeah I know it's a new guy I got sent to like well I was a very lucky that I got sent to the
[00:36:57] calm school on the east coast which was awesome but other than that it was like demo driver school
[00:37:03] just a few years after you chain up the trailer to the vehicle just complete new guys schools
[00:37:08] yeah yeah and then you get full new petune assistant to a commander yep assistant platoon commander
[00:37:14] and uh how's your work up you you do you do in a six month to uh what you do you know you're doing
[00:37:20] a six month appointment at this time team for deploys to South America yeah it was it deployment was
[00:37:25] two Panama and then from there just a lot of what J.S. joint combined exchanges for training where we
[00:37:30] we bounced around and you know we trained you know a Salvador you know Chilee Peru just the local
[00:37:37] operational forces that were similar to ours and um and it was just a big you know a big bunch of fun
[00:37:45] it's just it there just wasn't wasn't there were no real real stuff going on but uh lots of learning
[00:37:51] how was how was your you know what what what what would you feel like as a as a new guy officer if
[00:37:56] you were talking to yourself when you were younger you're talking to a young uh uh and senator lieutenant
[00:38:00] J.G. that's wrong into a platoon right now what what would your what would your advice be?
[00:38:06] look I think one of the things that that young officers always wrestle with is how to walk the line
[00:38:11] between being a leader when a leader is needed to step forward but at the same time really have the
[00:38:17] humility that a lot of other people know a lot of things that you don't know and to me that's what
[00:38:21] makes the team special is is when you think about how you make decisions and who makes decisions
[00:38:27] we just grow up with that just built into who we are and and and and that's really uh you know
[00:38:33] the the the thing you test is when do I step forward and say all right guys shut up lock it on we're
[00:38:39] going this direction and when do you kind of step back like like like you you a spouse in a lot of
[00:38:44] your work is leading from the rear is okay yeah no one ever expects the the seal leader to say
[00:38:53] hey lead from the rear right yeah are there times you got to lead from the front yes absolutely
[00:38:56] if you're doing something that dangerous or something that's horrible or something that's even
[00:38:59] monotonous sometimes you got to step up and say all right I got this but yeah well if I if I
[00:39:06] have the opportunity and someone on my platoon or my team wants to step up and lead no problem go for it
[00:39:11] I like to say I like to try and lead with minimum force required right well you know we I think
[00:39:18] there are a couple great points here first of all I always say the L and seal stands for lazy all right
[00:39:21] and and like we we find the easiest path to go achieve the goal because that gives you more time effort
[00:39:27] and energy for the next problem or let's you rest and recover for the next problem but you know
[00:39:32] it's like in business we're always thinking about succession planning and the only way you're
[00:39:38] going to get your second line ready to be the first line is if the first line can take a step back
[00:39:42] and let the second line be the first line so the only thing you need to do if you're in the
[00:39:45] leadership position and what I what I try to do now I think it's one thing I do decently
[00:39:49] is to step back and let other people make the decisions and only weigh in if and when needed
[00:39:54] most importantly it's the process does the process to make decisions make sense is it thinking about
[00:39:59] like the seals are a meritocracy as you know is who cares where the idea comes from you get all the
[00:40:03] ideas on the table you find the best idea and the best idea wins and that's the way you're going to
[00:40:07] go do the mission and that's exactly the way we we need to operate and often do operate in business
[00:40:13] yeah and and of course this doesn't mean you let the second string you know run off the cliff
[00:40:17] but you can let them bump into the guardrails and get a little dinged up and they're going to learn
[00:40:22] from that put some bondo on there and they'll be all right but a lot of times people are paranoid they
[00:40:27] don't want to take any risk at all and think that oh you you're gonna make a mistake it's like hey
[00:40:31] yeah they're gonna make mistakes and that's how they're gonna learn it comes down to comfort in
[00:40:34] your role right I mean it's it's if if I describe careers in three phases the first phase is getting
[00:40:40] really good at something whatever it is doctor lawyer seal whatever the second phase is trying to
[00:40:45] show the world you're really damn good at what you've chosen and that third phase which many people
[00:40:49] don't get to is being so confident that you are good that you no longer need to prove it to anybody
[00:40:55] and that's what lets you step back I think when I see in the business world the people the
[00:41:00] leaders who don't step back what I see is oftentimes a lack of a lack of confidence that
[00:41:08] that that makes the person feel like if they're not in front of the room making the decision
[00:41:14] then then they're not seen as the one in charge and so it's really I think a failure of leadership
[00:41:19] when you can't step back yeah I had one of the things I used to teach the jails was you have nothing
[00:41:26] to prove but everything to prove and the nothing to prove part is hey I don't care how we build this
[00:41:32] palette I don't care you know I don't care who goes on this operation I don't care what route we take
[00:41:39] in like there's a bunch of little decisions that are gonna get made that if your poll tune makes them
[00:41:44] it's perfectly fine and you don't need to prove well my way of getting to the target would be
[00:41:49] a little bit more efficient than yours or my way of building with my gutter feet wet yeah just like
[00:41:53] all these little things where sometimes that insecure junior leader feels like they need to prove
[00:41:59] to everyone that they're in charge and you don't you have nothing to prove you're actually
[00:42:03] in charge you're defacting in charge and that's fine you don't need to prove it what you do
[00:42:08] need to prove is that you're gonna listen that you're gonna pay attention that you're gonna
[00:42:11] make the right decisions at the right time that when it is time to weigh in you're gonna do
[00:42:16] something smart not something rash so yeah all good things to think about uh speaking of
[00:42:25] not being rash here's a little scenario you talk about in the book my platoon was once training
[00:42:32] at the al-tahama I'm gonna say that al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama al-tahama
[00:42:37] river in Georgia and we had an enthusiastic seal named Max we were carrying kayaks with a good
[00:42:43] amount of gear inside trying to find the most convenient way to transport guns, paddles and
[00:42:47] sensitive reconnaissance equipment that had to stay dry as we waited through the shallow water
[00:42:53] suddenly Max very calmly stopped and said to me Mr. Hayes there's a gator on my leg
[00:43:00] his calmed and demeanor in the face of such on the alarming statement caused me to doubt him
[00:43:05] until he lifted his leg out of the water and I saw three to four foot baby alligator had indeed
[00:43:11] added indeed latched around his knee Max to his extreme credit did not overreact he stayed calm
[00:43:17] certainly calmer than I would have been and took deep breaths until the alligator decided to open
[00:43:21] his mouth and let go Max was unharmed other than for bite mark two scars many of our enemies
[00:43:28] are not as cooperative as that baby alligator ended up being which is why our reactions to situations
[00:43:34] are so important the smartest seal isn't the one with the greatest wrong intelligence it's the one who has
[00:43:40] the best and quickest reaction to the problem the seal who can quickly assess and decide the best
[00:43:47] course of action is the one I want on my team not the seal who gets emotional and let's his
[00:43:52] feelings or his fears get in the way of pure rationality I said in chapter one that I would take
[00:43:59] someone with hunger over someone with greater ability every time I'd also take someone who reacts
[00:44:06] well over someone with greater raw intelligence you want both intelligence and control but in the
[00:44:13] stressful moments control matters a lot I would love to find people who are smart enough to predict
[00:44:19] the future but I haven't come across many of them so I need people who react well no matter what
[00:44:25] the future turns out to hold no matter the context the importance of having good controlled reactions
[00:44:32] to surprising situations can never be overstated so there you go freaking gator chops on your leg
[00:44:43] yeah you know you know the saying you don't have to out swim your buddy you just have to
[00:44:47] obviously you don't have to out swim the shark you just have to out swim your buddy so you know
[00:44:51] it's like should I go on a dry land and get away from this guy I remember that situation very
[00:44:56] well but in all sincerity it is the expression calm breeds calm excitement breeds excitement
[00:45:02] you've been shot at and rocketed enough to know that anytime you're not calm you are just
[00:45:07] using a motion that could be used to solve the problem yeah do you think that the that buds
[00:45:15] weeds out some of that it's a good question I think to some degree but not perfectly
[00:45:22] yeah it's definitely not perfect because I know you and I both have seen plenty of
[00:45:25] good like this guy max is a great example of like the calm cool collected seal that you want
[00:45:31] in your platoon either in charge of your platoon or wanting your machine gun or your platoon
[00:45:36] having a guy like that is awesome having somebody that's just loses their mind is
[00:45:41] absolutely horrible I think that's one of those traits that you can learn no I'm sure you're
[00:45:45] asked a similar question that I am frequently which is talked to me about what's innate
[00:45:50] leadership what are you born with and what can you train through time no I think that calm is a
[00:45:55] thing that you can learn and train through time do you agree a hundred percent and you know I
[00:46:01] got really lucky in that the last tour that I did was run and trade it out on the west coast and so
[00:46:05] I got to run this freaking leadership laboratory which was I honestly think it might have been
[00:46:12] the greatest leadership laboratory that's ever existed in the world I thought I think uh
[00:46:17] just to be able to put these guys in these stressful situations with so much on the line and
[00:46:24] look it wasn't life or death no so I guess combat isn't even better leadership laboratory except
[00:46:28] for and combat you can't take a guy and put him through iteration after iteration after iteration
[00:46:34] because he's dead if he's bad so you can't really it's not a laboratory it's a real world test
[00:46:38] is combat a better real world test then then going through training yes it is but the training
[00:46:44] that we had was really crazy good it was realistic it was hard and you would see guys develop these
[00:46:52] traits you would watch guys you'd see them and you'd put them into situation and they've
[00:46:56] lose their mind or they'd start getting getting panic or they'd start freaking out about
[00:47:01] something and you'd see everything would fall apart they're both who moved fall apart
[00:47:05] and then maybe you know the next time you said you know you say you're debrief from hey listen man
[00:47:09] when you start yelling and screaming on the radio no one's listening to you anymore it's not
[00:47:14] getting through anybody they can't make sense of what you're saying you need to calm down you need
[00:47:19] to think about what you're gonna say simple clearing exercise language so you breathe from on that
[00:47:22] and then the next time maybe they start getting excited you go hey man hey Fred come here take a wrap off
[00:47:28] think about what you're gonna say what are you gonna tell your pertune to do I'm gonna tell
[00:47:30] to get oh no hold on what are you gonna tell me do I'm gonna tell them to get hold on what are you
[00:47:34] telling them to do I'm gonna tell them to move to building 34 okay now come up on the radio and just say that or just
[00:47:40] yell it just just put the word out and they need to see the guy do it and you could see that they
[00:47:46] would learn so yes you can absolutely learn this stuff as long as you're humble enough to
[00:47:52] as long as you're humble enough to take criticism and and assess yourself so there was a bunch of
[00:47:57] things that that you can improve that look there's some things that you can't improve that right
[00:48:02] there's some genetic things that you have that you can't improve um this is another thing I wrote
[00:48:07] about leadership strategy tax set a guy coming through he's a tasky to commander super smart guy
[00:48:12] good tactician the voice of a mouse right so when it came time to put out word you know like
[00:48:20] to tell everyone what was going on he just didn't have the couldn't project his voice at all
[00:48:26] and so I'm talking to him like hey man listen you gotta start you gotta start putting the word out
[00:48:30] and in my mind I'm thinking you know maybe this is just maybe I'm just super biased towards being
[00:48:35] loud because I have a loud voice maybe I'm just biased and so I'm watching him and I can see he's
[00:48:41] trying to put out word no one can hear it's a problem so I say hey man if you don't start
[00:48:47] up being your volume people can't hear you I don't even know if you can do this job
[00:48:52] which is a real like horrible thing to tell someone this guy's a tasky to commander he's been
[00:48:57] in the teams for 12 or 15 years or something this has seen your guy and now I'm telling him how you
[00:49:01] can't do this and then the next iteration I'm watching him and he's got to make the call and he
[00:49:09] grabs like big mouth bill it is put to one of the tunes is like hey bill tell everyone he
[00:49:15] get to building 34 now and I was like oh cool problem solved so you've got to you've got some
[00:49:21] things that you can't get better at you know some people aren't articulate talking in front of a
[00:49:25] crowd okay cool hey echo you're good in front of a crowd you put the word out to the troops or
[00:49:29] some people can't simplify a problem so it's like hey Mike I'm having a hard time getting through this
[00:49:34] can you simplify this thing so I'm gonna can understand it so there's some things that you're
[00:49:38] gonna naturally not gonna be great at put your leadership team together where you got some people
[00:49:43] that are good at that and then be humble enough to say you know what Mike's a lot better at
[00:49:46] simplifying things that I am and that goes a lot more articulate than I am so I'm gonna have
[00:49:49] Mike figure out the problem and I'm gonna have echo talk about it and we're gonna be good to go
[00:49:53] I'm gonna sit back and just try and get these guys what they need so there are things that you
[00:49:58] can not get better at you can you can you can you can you can you improve them a little bit but you
[00:50:01] might not become an expert out of but there's there's definitely some things that you can
[00:50:06] absolutely improve on and being calm and being able to detach and take a step back is
[00:50:11] most certainly most certainly one of them so that was your system between command I was
[00:50:17] at anything else I was you got one story on that deployment about kind of getting help it was this
[00:50:22] when you got held up at gunpoint yeah talk us through that so 1996 we were the squad in in
[00:50:30] Peru squads eight seals so it's myself and in seven guys and you know we were just training
[00:50:35] the proven seals nothing crazy and the I will say that in those days the leader of the shining
[00:50:42] path Cendero Lumino so which was a terrorist organization was in jail about a mile or less
[00:50:48] in a mile from the Peruvian seals compound so we were likely you know watched or people knew
[00:50:54] that there was somebody in country helping the Peruvian seals but myself and my LPO stayed back in
[00:51:01] Lima for just a day while the rest of the guys flew forward to a Kidos Peru which was deep in
[00:51:06] the jungles of the Amazon and and we just literally out to dinner one night driving back from dinner
[00:51:12] unarmed and two cop cars pinned us in really really quickly jumped out with three or four guys
[00:51:20] armed you know rifles and you know basically open the door held me a gunpoint threatened me with
[00:51:26] execution and and they drove us around and basically interrogated us asked us a bunch of
[00:51:32] questions that nobody ever really wants to answer you know how you want to be tortured how you want to be
[00:51:36] executed how you want to die you know and and and a lot of worse things than that I had a
[00:51:41] point where I could have jumped out of the car that might my LPO can need him was in the back
[00:51:46] of the sesuvias in the middle seats and I could have jumped out when the car was going 40 years
[00:51:51] so saved myself and I very very vividly remember I can never ever jump out of this car because I
[00:51:57] couldn't live with myself if I bailed on Ken and I lived and they killed him just not who I wanted
[00:52:03] it back to the migrant fathers and who do you want to be so you know we learned never bail on your
[00:52:07] swim buddy and I was not I was fortunate after that incident because I could answer really
[00:52:13] really truthfully knowing that in a life and death situation that I would not bail on my swim buddy
[00:52:18] so it was a a lot of learning at a young age how do you get out of that scenario you know I did
[00:52:24] what I what I would have wanted victims to do if I were in the other role don't look at the victim
[00:52:32] so we can't identify or excuse me don't look at the assailants so that we can't identify them
[00:52:36] and the threat goes down and and just be compliant and answer to our previous part of the conversation
[00:52:42] around calm I was so overcome these you would never think that I was even 1% remotely worried about
[00:52:48] the situation I was in I in Spanish I was like hey where economists were desk workers we work at the
[00:52:53] at the embassy and you know we were just out to dinner these things happen all the time if we get it you
[00:52:57] guys need the car take the car we have insurance go take it it's all that's all you and and just
[00:53:03] really totally mellow answer these questions and I think these guys just figured out these guys
[00:53:08] aren't a threat these guys these guys can't possibly be seals so so so they drove us around
[00:53:13] and after the interrogation of about an hour they brought us out of the car gun point now is like
[00:53:17] okay there's the point where they either pull the trigger they don't myself and Ken just kept
[00:53:21] walking because I remember very vividly thinking hey a 10 foot shot is harder than a 0 foot shot
[00:53:26] you know maybe they'll miss an organ and so I just quickly put space between me and the
[00:53:30] guy who had a gun and at the point he just I wasn't looking backwards so I can't tell you what
[00:53:34] he was doing I was just ready to be shot and and they they never pulled the trigger
[00:53:41] that doesn't sound like a very nice last day in the in the city of there I have not been back to
[00:53:47] Lima and so that's what you did on that deployment you travel around this is pre 911 you're
[00:53:54] traveling around your training other forces and and then what happens after that after that
[00:54:01] tour is that that's when you go to Germany went to a DLI for learning German for nine months
[00:54:07] then ended up you know just going over to Germany oh you went to DLI first I did yeah
[00:54:13] so you speak three languages then well you can't tell what the count no I'm still working on English
[00:54:19] so you go to DLI and then you come over to Germany this is where I meet you 97 98
[00:54:28] 98 because I went I basically got done with OCS I showed up at Sealtime 2 and immediately went over there
[00:54:35] and it was the Master Chief there who was one of my platoon chiefs and apparently the conversation
[00:54:44] went the the commander over there or or an ops officer said hey we need like a we need someone to
[00:54:49] come and help out with with ops and they were sending their sending this ensin and they're saying
[00:54:56] who the the cus are sending us team 2 sent us a damn ensin like what good is this guy going to do and
[00:54:59] then then the Master Chief sees my name and goes away to second I know this guy so you say that name again
[00:55:05] ensin will link we want this guy over here that's so sure enough I showed up and we played water polo
[00:55:13] yeah I don't know what what we did beside that if in all truth we probably filled out some
[00:55:17] forms and almost like in the almost the pre computer days you know so I don't know what in the world
[00:55:23] we possibly we weren't delete and email in those days well I'll tell you a funny story we went to
[00:55:28] we did some big joint exercise and the the skipper at the time he's like all right jokko you're
[00:55:36] going to go forward and we're going to you're going to run the the tech cooperation center and like
[00:55:41] you know these days we think of a tech cooperation center you know we're talking plasma TV's
[00:55:47] in satellite links and internet you're talking you know like a star track look in scenario
[00:55:52] I shit you not we went on this mission and I fit this quote tactical operation center into
[00:55:59] one single rock sack I had like a sack for seventy seven hundred dollars something I had a bunch
[00:56:03] of maps I had some like I thought I was square away because I had you know like some overlays for the
[00:56:08] maps and then how much the world changed between that time so this is 1998 what I literally had the
[00:56:16] tactical operation I mean this isn't a big exercise a big giant joint exercise that was taking place all
[00:56:20] over Europe and I had a little you know we had a little the the seals there had a little roll
[00:56:25] in this exercise but it was a big exercise a lot of stuff going on and I literally had the entire
[00:56:30] tactical operation center set in in my rock sack that's that's scary that's some good times right there
[00:56:40] so then how how long you how long you spend in Germany for two years and that was the
[00:56:45] Bosnia coast of Odez and so there was some good learning there too and and I I felt like
[00:56:50] I would be a better platoon commander if I went overseas at a role like that for two years and
[00:56:56] honestly those two years really set me up to be in my in my opinion a much better platoon
[00:57:00] commander when I got to seal teammate in 99 yeah and and just kind of had some epic leadership over
[00:57:07] there too the unit that you were at I mean those leaders are just incredible leadership over there
[00:57:13] incredible really strong Rick smother's yeah yeah just great guys that awesome times um
[00:57:22] any major so it's through when you say all there's there's lessons that I learned or the
[00:57:26] things that I got from that deployment I mean is it just learning what it's like from the other
[00:57:31] side when you're on deployment yeah it's it's some taking a look at a seal platoon and saying
[00:57:37] what is the effective employment of a seal platoon when you're in the platoon you're a little
[00:57:43] bit I don't want to say biased you're you have a narrow view you know and so understanding the
[00:57:49] difference between what success and you know and I wouldn't say failure but like some average
[00:57:55] performance is was really important to me because you know hearing having the opportunity at a
[00:58:01] a young age at a junior seniority to see the senior leadership say hey that was really awesome
[00:58:07] or what the hell are those guys doing just those statements themselves carried value I was um
[00:58:15] in training sell at seal team one so I was like an E5 and I went on my first trip
[00:58:21] where I was kind of like the trip lead and it was to floored a to hurl but field floored a
[00:58:26] and we put a platoon out in the field for a recon and whatever and like they they flew down
[00:58:31] there went right in the field they might have even jumped into the field but anyways they go
[00:58:34] down there they go right in the field and of course I was there on the ad von getting the target
[00:58:37] set up and all this stuff and then they get done with the operation and we pull them out of the
[00:58:43] field and now they've got whatever it is three days in four wall and beach for a while and I'm like
[00:58:49] for it was the first time that I saw a platoon from the outside and I was like oh my god this is
[00:58:57] going to be a problem like there's no way he's got you're going to get through three days of
[00:59:03] liberty here we this is going to be crazy and I remember that was the first time I was
[00:59:08] not in a platoon because we're in a platoon you don't you just like oh we can go out now cool
[00:59:11] oh we're done with our op cool we're going to go out and do whatever we want in whatever we are
[00:59:17] and that was like the first time I saw it from the outside and it was a good learning lesson for me
[00:59:22] yeah you know like we often see now it's you don't know what you don't know and so how do you
[00:59:27] take things from that unknown unknown quadrant and make them known I like whether it's the seals or
[00:59:32] in business all of the risk and all of the opportunity is in that unknown unknown quadrant so how do you
[00:59:38] get into that and identify and pull it back out so we didn't realize it in those days but that's what we were
[00:59:43] doing yeah it's uh if you that's another lesson another uh should say a reiteration of the lesson
[00:59:53] of to take a step back and see something because when you're in that platoon you don't you don't
[00:59:58] you've been on the plymet before you knew what it was like to go on the plymet but you were in a
[01:00:02] platoon and so you don't like know the perspective of not being in the platoon and not understanding
[01:00:08] what that looks like from the outside and not understanding what it looks like when there's some
[01:00:13] kind of an incident and how much that disrupts everyone and how much it hurts our reputation as seals
[01:00:19] you know that's something you know when you're in a siope to and someone gets in trouble you're like oh
[01:00:23] Fred got in trouble you don't think about it from you know what is the fleet think of that what is that army
[01:00:29] commander that's there think of those things you just don't well at least I didn't I had you know
[01:00:33] him as young dumb and well just young dumb I guess you're definitely just that yeah um
[01:00:41] so you wrap up there you wrap up there and then where you go seal teammate took over as a platoon commander
[01:00:46] and um did work up and then deployed down to a possible so what what year is it now so 99 I moved back
[01:00:55] to Virginia Beach and take over as a platoon commander and when you get there how how you how you feeling
[01:01:03] how you feeling to get your platoon do it so great it's like finally like I'm ready you know it's
[01:01:07] it's been a year of like put me in coach and then you're finally in and it's just off to the races
[01:01:12] and just you know it's you remember the feeling well I'm sure it's it's um it's everything it's
[01:01:18] cracked up to be in more and so you said you this is that teammate yeah and so now you guys are
[01:01:24] basically fighting to try and get to go back to you com yep and go to co-savo Bosnia whatever's
[01:01:32] happening in that theater because that's the only showing time but we we made it back and you know we
[01:01:37] did a deployment there where we were doing you know small four or six man special reconnaissance
[01:01:43] missions and you know we go out on three or four day ops and then we stand QRF for three or four
[01:01:50] days while another sister part of the you know would go out and then and then we'd have three or four
[01:01:56] days off so we were actually in quite a regular predictable cycle while we were overseas
[01:02:01] you talk a little bit about one of these operations here in the book here we go I was in
[01:02:08] co-savo in 1999 in the middle of winter leading a small surveillance team in the mountains
[01:02:12] just a few hundred meters from the Serbian border freezing cold temperatures the darkness of night
[01:02:17] howling winds and both co-savar Serbian and Albanian armies somewhere in that same snowy terrain
[01:02:24] weapons ready looking for an enemy to fight as we suffered through the elements the sun
[01:02:30] soon to rise we knew we needed to find a place to rest and hide for the daylight hours from our
[01:02:36] vantage point halfway up the side of a mountain struggling to maintain our balance on the steeply
[01:02:41] sloping ground we could see a natural line of drift below railroad tracks a 10 foot wide patch
[01:02:47] of flat ground a path that could that would have called out to anyone as the comfortable place
[01:02:52] we should naturally set up camp of course we wanted to move down there I remember a young guy and
[01:02:58] our team in credulous that we could even be out in this kind of weather humans can't survive in this
[01:03:04] he said it's miserable the temptation to head down toward the easier path and the more comfortable
[01:03:11] sight was real but if it was calling out to us we knew it would be calling out to anyone who
[01:03:16] happened to be coming that way going down there would make us more visible more vulnerable and
[01:03:22] more likely to run into trouble so we set up camp a couple hundred year meters up the steeply
[01:03:28] angled slope and sure enough within an hour and just a short time before sunrise what looked like
[01:03:34] the entire Albanian army marched straight down that natural line of drift had we been camped there
[01:03:40] they would have found us for sure doing the uncomfortable exhausting thing the hard thing saved us
[01:03:47] that day so those are the type of operations you were doing yeah you're a great reader by the way
[01:03:56] yes did you did you guys do winter warfare in your workup we did and this was after I guess
[01:04:04] teammate or sorry team two had sort of given up the the the the the the the the rock they had on winter
[01:04:10] warfare they they did and you know it was all of you know four or six weeks or something like that
[01:04:15] in the Colorado what are they 13,000 or 14,000 mean foot peaks and so we did you know slept in snow caves
[01:04:21] and attempted to get good at telemark but certainly get good at that snow-showing and we did all the
[01:04:27] winter workup and and it really paid off because those operations in Kosovo were sometimes really
[01:04:31] miserable from a weather perspective and and then on that particular passage you just read I mean
[01:04:36] I just very vividly remember thinking like if we would have given in and done the easy thing there
[01:04:40] we we probably would not have survived we at a minimum would have been captured and interrogated
[01:04:49] that so you you did us full six month appointment down in that AO yes and you're doing pretty much
[01:04:55] three days on in the field three days on a QRF and then three days off yes with four stage
[01:05:01] of QRF and sleep in a home beef for three days or you know just be at the ready to go help
[01:05:05] whoever is in the field maybe you know ten or so kilometers or whatever it might be from the
[01:05:09] main element anyone ever get contacted we did on one operation it actually was the quick story is
[01:05:19] that we observed and arms transfer recall we were enforcing the date and piece of chords and and and we saw
[01:05:27] Russian forces handing weapons to
[01:05:31] Serbians which is not the date and piece of chords and this is early early in the day of no
[01:05:37] light you know no light cameras and near real time sat calm sending it back so we we got pictures
[01:05:46] and to documented the whole thing and then we weren't set up to do any sort of offensive
[01:05:52] operations you know we had a whatever 80 pound packs for three days and you know as many ham
[01:05:56] sandwiches as you could stuff in your backpack but the the there was a nearby army special forces
[01:06:03] house that that could get out get out and get underway we called them in they went and looked through
[01:06:07] the the building where the transfer had happened and I mean I just assumed that that meant we would
[01:06:13] be our mission would be over you know the age old saying if you assume if you think you've been
[01:06:19] compromised assume you have and if you have expel and this was a leadership thing I got put
[01:06:24] against the army major at the time who was in charge of the the soxie the special operations
[01:06:28] command and control element said Charlie Mike and continue mission and I was never remember
[01:06:35] over computer kind of getting in a little bit of an argument with him saying hey here's what we
[01:06:38] do in the seals this means we're over ultimately talked about it with a couple of us the six of
[01:06:43] us that were in the field said a boy's what do we think here is this is let we have time to talk
[01:06:48] this through and and everybody said you know what it's let's let's let's just continue mission
[01:06:52] let's not make this an issue we don't feel that threatened so so we just catch everyone up here
[01:06:56] so you're in the field you see this weapons transfer and you're you do this you you tell the story
[01:07:01] in the book with with great detail and it's an awesome story but you're you're in the field you're
[01:07:06] doing a reconnaissance you see this weapons transfer take place and it's illegal and it shouldn't
[01:07:12] be happening and you actually get photographs of it and you push those up over satcom which but
[01:07:17] this is not like the movies this is this is a legit effort to get that done and very cool that
[01:07:22] you guys were able to pull that off you get photographs of this weapons transfer taking place
[01:07:27] and then you send that up the chain of command and what the chain of command does is push
[01:07:31] his special forces group out to go inspect the area which clearly anyone with
[01:07:39] any sort of tactical sense is going to go oh we just did a weapons transfer and now the
[01:07:44] US military's there there's someone watching and so your thought is okay once the green
[01:07:50] berets go and inspect that site we need to get that out of here well you get told by the chain
[01:07:55] of command no you're not leaving you're gonna stay eyes on and this is where you have the
[01:07:59] discussion hold on a second what do you mean stay here and so that's where you're on so what's
[01:08:04] the decision so we we stayed and then not a few hours later we were being you know actively hunted by
[01:08:12] we counted 19 armed individuals looking through this treeline and trying to figure out where we were
[01:08:17] and you know we were set up with two OP's observation posts and then one CP command post so so
[01:08:26] two six people in the field two two and two I was in the command post with my my radioman
[01:08:30] and I did not have eyes on I was back a bit and then there's in one of the command in one of the
[01:08:35] observation posts Chad Wilkinson who you know rest in peace hero you had Sarah Wilkinson
[01:08:43] and I don't know another amazing American hero on your your show recently just you know one of my
[01:08:48] life long friends and basically radio back to me it's at hey boss we got to make a decision here
[01:08:54] we're there's somebody coming down the treeline and we either need to you know take them out
[01:08:59] or fall back and I just said listen Chad here's the deal if you you take him out just know that
[01:09:05] we're gonna have you already know this well 18 other people hunting us even more actively but do
[01:09:10] whatever you think is right and I'm behind you and and he ultimately with one of the guys he was
[01:09:16] with pulled back took eyes off didn't shoot and to this day I think that was one of the greatest
[01:09:22] decisions ever because we the six of us got back together and then we just worked our way out of a
[01:09:27] really tricky problem I remember two or three times having my weapon in hand coming off safe
[01:09:33] finger on the trigger with like an Albanian you know insurgent if you will walking feet from me
[01:09:39] and saying okay please don't let me have to shoot this guy because it'll be a bad day and we made it out
[01:09:45] we ultimately made it out yeah and this is like I said and it's hard for people to really
[01:09:53] it might be hard for people to comprehend this this is pre 9 11 so you're out there doing real
[01:09:58] operations before the war kicks off and getting yourself into leadership situations and
[01:10:04] learning a lot and really being pretty being pretty lucky in that situation for sure
[01:10:14] so you could done with that deployment and then what do you do next well I screen to go to
[01:10:20] seal team six and as you know they take only a handful of officers every year and I screen positive
[01:10:26] I needed to come back from deployment just a couple of weeks early to go to what they call green
[01:10:30] team and my commanding officer said Mike you can't come home early you can apply again
[01:10:34] next year and I just remember being so disappointed and and I came home and I was like you know what
[01:10:40] forget this I'm I just don't see a future in the seals for me after this and and that's right around
[01:10:45] that was literally the time when we started deploying again as two platoons going overseas and
[01:10:50] they said Mike I got a different job for you stay here at seal team eight be in charge of two seal
[01:10:55] platoons and I had a hard decision to make because I just wanted to go to development group and
[01:11:00] and be the best of the best and and in those days like that's where you went if you really wanted to
[01:11:05] you know be in the mix the regular teams weren't in the mix nearly as much and I just
[01:11:12] ultimately you know like many times in life don't don't overreact and stay calm and think about
[01:11:19] what's the best thing and and to this day I'm I look back at that decision as Mike Mike
[01:11:24] as as incredibly fortuitous because my life wouldn't have paned out the way it did and so
[01:11:28] you know nine eleven happened and all of us in the teams had way more work than we ever would have
[01:11:33] wanted and so life works out you don't always think it does in the moment when you get really
[01:11:37] frustrated with a decision that's not breaking your way but when you zoom out over time things usually
[01:11:42] work out where were you in September 11th happened I was on the pull-up bars at seal team eight
[01:11:51] handful of us just doing a command PT and just really just never forget the moment
[01:11:57] so at this point were you a task unit commander this was yeah I was a in charge of two
[01:12:03] seal platoons and we were in them in our work up we weren't close to being deployed overseas but
[01:12:08] like everything we were scrambling and I actually remember there were questions like who knows
[01:12:12] how to operate singer missiles this is when there are planes in the sky nobody knew what was going on
[01:12:16] and and we were getting ready to go you know you are basically protect the ships and just
[01:12:23] homeland defense if you will if that's what it took so we ended up not doing any of that but just
[01:12:28] watching on TV just like everybody else but but as you know that that infamous day really changed
[01:12:34] all of our future and then where did you go on deployment when you so now did you take that task
[01:12:37] unit on deployment we we did and and we went over to Germany in Europe at the European command and we were
[01:12:46] we were really ready to go and didn't get put into the mix early on so it again a little bit
[01:12:54] disappointing and I said to myself what in the world I'm sitting here as a task unit commander
[01:12:59] ready to serve the nation and we have forces at the ready but but we're in the wrong theater
[01:13:05] and there was talk about every day there was talk about pulling us from Europe over at
[01:13:09] you calm over to set calm to help out it didn't happen and again I said all right you know what
[01:13:14] if this is the way that things are going to break I applied for the the Paul Mill Fellowship the
[01:13:19] political military fellowship no seal had ever been picked for two years of fully funded grad school
[01:13:24] and I said all right I'm at the stage of life where I need to to think about other things and
[01:13:28] I thought let me just put my name in the hat here and I was the lucky squirrel that was picked and
[01:13:32] I got two years of fully funded grad school and then went to to grad school in Cambridge mass
[01:13:38] for for two years from 0 3 to 0 5 so the whole early phase of the war I was largely an observer
[01:13:45] when you there's a I asked often about this especially from young seal leaders right now
[01:13:53] because you know every seal joins this well you hope that every seal joins the teams because they
[01:13:58] want to go to war and then there's no wars going on how was it so you're in a task unit you
[01:14:04] got a fully capable task unit you've September 11th has happened when when is this deployment to
[01:14:09] you come um like 2001 so that would have been yeah oh one it was oh one yeah so you go on to
[01:14:17] appointment oh one oh two and you've got a bunch of hungry frog men and they're sitting around in Europe
[01:14:24] it's exactly right what's the what what did you do to try and keep your your forces focused on
[01:14:30] the mission at hand pull ups yeah that's a rough one that was a rough one as well I've
[01:14:39] I've told many young seals that I was in the seal teams for 13 years before I ever shot my weapon
[01:14:44] at the enemy and you don't know and all you can do is keep going keep doing what
[01:14:48] workups and keep going on deployment keep training that's the best thing you can do is keep
[01:14:52] don't workups keep going on deployment keep trying to get better and they're the the
[01:14:56] naysets gonna call at some point totally great so you are you think and maybe once you get
[01:15:03] done with that deployment sounds like you're also the new young frog man that's pretty fast
[01:15:06] off and not going to war so you apply to go to school you go up you get you think you're going
[01:15:13] to get out after that or you're incurred three your obligation so at that point I had
[01:15:18] done on a twelve or so years in but I was like I I wanted to finish twenty years with a master's
[01:15:22] degree and so you know the Kennedy School of Government was a really good path you know being the first
[01:15:27] seal for this program I thought great I applied at Harvard Business School and then the detail
[01:15:32] it was like way that's a little too far off the reservation you can do a master's in public policy
[01:15:37] at the Kennedy School and I applied there and and got in so that was um that took me from 03 to 05
[01:15:43] and then as you know a date burn in every seals head is June 28 2005 I had orders to seal
[01:15:49] team 10 all the guys on the other helicopter were all teammates from seal team 8 and uh and I
[01:15:54] went overseas right away and took over for for Eric Christians and God rest him and uh and basically
[01:15:59] took over for the guys who were in who weren't shot down on June 28 2005 so so so so so so
[01:16:12] that shot that shot that that that shit happened um I don't know what to better what to say
[01:16:16] it and you are the guy that goes then to team 10 and you go on deployment and you take over
[01:16:23] for Christiansen yep I'd already been a task unit commander and I was like so privileged to be
[01:16:28] able to do it again I you know I felt like my calling was to help all the guys who were um
[01:16:34] who lived through that who really had a hard a really hard day you write in the book about some of the
[01:16:41] things that you implemented to try and help guys out from uh I guess a psychological and
[01:16:48] spiritual perspective talk us a little talk us through that a little bit not only um what you did
[01:16:55] but also what made you what gave you the awareness you know this is pretty early on in the war
[01:17:01] and you seem to be so you seem to somehow be instinctively or intuitively know that
[01:17:08] guys who are going to need some help yeah I think look I'd like to say in life I just have
[01:17:12] varying levels of ignorance on everything and some things I'm a little less ignorant on but this
[01:17:16] was definitely one of them uh I I in talking to the guys I realized that this isn't a problem we're
[01:17:22] going to solve alone kind of your voice example for the the the sweety voice guy or real here you know
[01:17:27] and so uh no what you're good at no what you're not good at no how to bring in teammates that that are
[01:17:32] better at things than you and and and so we I asked to have a psychologist and a chaplain come out
[01:17:39] and uh took everybody in the platoon aside and I said listen I've had one on one conversations
[01:17:43] with every single one of you you are all struggling with things in different different different
[01:17:47] things and in different ways I will never talk about any of our conversations with anybody else it's
[01:17:52] not it's not for public knowledge but but here's the deal um I I want every single one of you to
[01:17:59] spend at least five minutes with a chaplain and five minutes with a psych it's it was very counter-cultural
[01:18:03] at the time you know all we did and I was growing either strength or perceived strength and this
[01:18:10] was kind of like weakness and it could be perceived as weakness clearly not but um but in those
[01:18:16] days could be perceived as weakness and you know we we had the you know the guys who would you know
[01:18:21] beat their chest and say no fing way am I talking to the chaplain and blah blah blah and I was just like
[01:18:25] okay the way to get through this is make everybody do it and there'll be no stigma for who did
[01:18:30] who didn't talk and and there wasn't a single person who didn't talk less than several hours
[01:18:36] to each of the psych and the chaplain we had to extend them there for a couple weeks and and really
[01:18:41] I think set the foundation for a couple things number one is for each of those guys in their own
[01:18:45] lives as they dealt with you know the post-traumatic stress of of doing the body recoveries
[01:18:51] from the downhill a copter and and putting their buddies and bags and bringing them home
[01:18:54] which which clearly isn't easy and just the extreme loss of teammates and such it was the
[01:18:59] first-year-old mass casualty that the seal had in the modern era and so I just felt like it was
[01:19:06] a no-brainer to me to bring in to bring in help and then I ultimately as I return from that
[01:19:12] deployment made a real push to get a psychologist on the staff and to begin the era of of really
[01:19:17] saying asking for help is a sign of strength not weakness. Yeah you definitely get some credit
[01:19:24] for some foresight there because yeah that's that that culture that we have in the seal teams of like
[01:19:32] just suck it up just deal with it and that's just the way it's going to be for you to sort of
[01:19:39] see beyond that that's definitely that's an admirable move right there. We're just here to help each other
[01:19:46] um so you guys get done with that deployment and come home and and now what do you do now
[01:19:58] now are you the ops officer at 1010 or so. This is the era where the ops officer at a team became
[01:20:04] an O4 so I'd already been an ops officer is an O3 I became the ops officer as an O4 so
[01:20:10] this is why my career has been it was awesome I just spent that seal teams my whole life I never did
[01:20:14] a boat unit tour I never did an STV tour I just was in this perfect storm of always seal team
[01:20:19] seal team seal team so now I'm an ops officer again I already know how to do the job pretty decently
[01:20:24] we uh and that's really you know O5 all the way through late O7 which included a six month
[01:20:33] deployment as as the deputy commander for Soto Fwest and Onbar which you know very well I was I think
[01:20:38] one I was like a couple months after you is when I got there and um and so just you know some
[01:20:45] augmentations I got to get out to theater a couple times during the work up for a month we were
[01:20:50] really aggressively augmenting guys forward as you recall so so you guys roll out to Iraq and what
[01:20:58] 2007 you take the team is going on deployment yeah it was um spring of O7 and this is this is when
[01:21:06] Jason Redmond's out with guys Redmond's when he got wounded and the other guys with him got wounded
[01:21:12] what was that deployment like from your perspective? That's where all my like it was
[01:21:20] night after night of stopping bad think people from doing bad things to good people you know we were
[01:21:24] literally like vampire hours one cycle of darkness operations you know as soon as the the the
[01:21:31] sun goes down that think about you know you very your operation do you leave the FoB at 1030 pm or 1145 pm you
[01:21:37] know it's like and and you remember these days really well but just one cycle of darkness you get back
[01:21:42] before sunrise you know you you lay down around six in the morning and you get back up at 10 a.m.
[01:21:47] and you rinse and repeat it was a really high up tempo and in Soto Fwest we had about I want to say
[01:21:52] about 15 or maybe 18 kind of outstations throughout the onbar province and so there's always something
[01:21:58] going on somewhere and I'll say I was I was really fortunate it was team 10 and team 7 came together
[01:22:04] we we so the CO team 7 was the CO of the the of onbar and I was the deputy commander and you know
[01:22:13] really privileged just a quick aside I one of my one of my favorite most memorable memorable
[01:22:18] buds instructors mark cramped and just beat the hell out of us and and and and used to do berm
[01:22:24] sprints and and just would get out there and lead from the front and I was just always so impressed
[01:22:28] with this man back in 93 when I went through training on this deployment in 2007 marks the command
[01:22:34] master chief for Sealtime 7 and one of my some of my greatest days when mark and I strap hang
[01:22:39] and go out on operations and literally the two of us you know two guys who didn't have to go on
[01:22:43] the operations going out every third night and it was just super meaningful for me and that's why
[01:22:48] you know as I I visited Coronado yesterday so one of the the way I started my workout was going
[01:22:56] to the very berm where where mark used to make us do those berm sprints and I just had some quiet
[01:23:03] time all by myself and just you know spoken my head to mark and you know just paid a huge tribute
[01:23:07] to him just yesterday and made myself super effing miserable and you know it's it's this is this is
[01:23:15] the weight that we all carry you know so for those you know mark marked by suicide about three
[01:23:19] weeks ago just before Easter this couple weeks ago yeah a guy that I never saw him without a smile on
[01:23:26] his face in my whole career never saw him without a smile on his face with a great attitude
[01:23:32] looking to help everybody just just just pure positivity and just shut the shocking I don't know
[01:23:41] how to explain it. Where you guys were you guys working with I Rackies was every element out there
[01:23:50] working with I Rackies. We were but you know as well as I do it was a lot of it was window dressing
[01:23:56] you know hey guys we got to start building these guys up we got to take you know six or 12
[01:24:01] I Rackies with a son the mission and it was early in the days of actually you know really
[01:24:06] committing to trying to build the Iraqi army. We tried we tried to build the Iraqi army and
[01:24:13] we would take them out and it was definitely the one of the biggest challenges was trying to work
[01:24:20] with the Iraqi army especially at that time and that's why it was very it was very rewarding when
[01:24:24] they pushed into the middle later in 2017, 1819 and the Iraqi did a lot of the fighting and they
[01:24:32] made incredible sacrifices which you know at the time when when I was there in 2006 you wouldn't
[01:24:38] anticipate them stepping up many of them stepping up at all you know there's if there was a few
[01:24:46] brave Iraqi soldiers for sure but a lot of them you would think about they're not going to be able to
[01:24:50] ever do this for themselves. Yeah well for us I mean so I got sprint that deployment started I think
[01:24:56] was March of O seven and I recall the peak of the insurgency by using the metric of attacks on
[01:25:01] Americans which we know is a flawed metric when you have more Americans or more attacks on Americans but
[01:25:05] the um but the there were the way to to kind of quantify it is my first 30 days in theater in
[01:25:12] Felusia we lost 35 Marines from the greater Felusia area and and so it was just night after night
[01:25:20] it we didn't we were in the real early innings of of being able to actually confidently take
[01:25:26] a lot of Iraqis out on operations and let them take the risk for their own nation.
[01:25:32] Where'd you bring back from that deployment for lessons learned? Wow that's a great question I think
[01:25:38] the the main thing is sustained operations the importance of of efficiency and making sure that that
[01:25:48] that you don't have seals or special forces doing things that don't take seals to do.
[01:25:53] You know when I grew up there was a little bit of an attitude in coming out of buds that's like
[01:25:58] I'm a seal you're not you know there's there's the seals and there's the non seals at the team and I
[01:26:03] think the you I know you live this way also the faster you learn that an integrated team
[01:26:09] is what it needs what it takes to be successful the faster your trajectories to success these are
[01:26:13] things that weren't learned quite as quickly in the early days but in that deployment all of the
[01:26:17] younger guys that that were able to hand off you know the Iraqis the the the the insurgents that they
[01:26:23] took off a target and hand them to somebody else to interrogate them and you know there's a lot of
[01:26:27] people that can ask questions in interrogate you don't have to be a seal to have that skill or
[01:26:31] intelligence analyst or whatever the case may be and so I think we got really good at saying what's the
[01:26:36] part of the job that just takes a seal to do what's that comparative advantage and then how do you
[01:26:41] hire people for everything else yeah you know I tell this to leaders all the time do you should
[01:26:48] be doing things that only you can do and if someone else can do it you're in a leadership position
[01:26:53] let's someone else do it and if there's no one else can do it cool then that's an indication that
[01:26:57] maybe you should start training someone to do that other thing that you only at this time can do
[01:27:03] because as long as you're the only person that can do a job that's what you're going to be doing
[01:27:06] that job and that's that should be your goal not to be doing the same thing forever and if you're
[01:27:12] doing that job that means you're looking down and in instead of being able to look up and out
[01:27:16] and see what the next horizon's going to be see what the next market's going to be see where we
[01:27:20] can maneuver to those are all things we need to look at um you could done with that deployment
[01:27:27] and this is this one you went to the White House yeah I finished three years basically of run
[01:27:31] and pretty hard as the exo so the the ops officer and then fleeted up as the exo at Sealteen
[01:27:37] 10 did you deploy again with the XO I did and where did you go on that oh sorry that was the
[01:27:42] Iraq deployment okay got that that was that was got it so so I did two deployments one as like the
[01:27:48] right out of grad school got it and then the exo's Sealteen Iraq deployment though um so come back
[01:27:55] and and for for everybody listening we're really good about succession planning and the Seals
[01:27:59] you know you once you're in the seat a seat for two or three years you're thinking how you have
[01:28:03] to get out of your seat and make room for the next guy and we do these diversity tours I was
[01:28:08] fortunate my first diversity tour was you know graduate school for two years in Cambridge mass
[01:28:14] and it was time for me to get out of my chair as the exo is Sealteen 10 and I applied for the White
[01:28:18] House Fellowship it's a non military program it is a great leadership public service program
[01:28:26] I threw you know that's a through my name and the hat it's quite an extensive application for us
[01:28:30] and ultimately was picked the their thousands of applicants the nation picks 14 to be White House
[01:28:36] Fellows every year and I got placed as the director for defense policy and strategy for Bush
[01:28:42] so literally report to the national security adviser who reports to the president like day seven
[01:28:46] I'm running my first meetings in the White House situation room it like the who is a lot of steep learning
[01:28:51] walking around pretending like you know how to you're wearing a washing in DC you know I'm like you
[01:28:56] know dumb team guy all of a sudden thrown in the policy world but you got speaking of
[01:29:01] getting this job in the selection process you got a cool thing in here that that talks about that a
[01:29:06] little bit going back to the book my interviewer sat me down and asked a bunch of questions a bunch
[01:29:11] of introductory questions then stared at me with intensity and said Mike what do you know about the
[01:29:16] start treaty I took a breath looked at him and said with dead pan seriousness I know how to spell it
[01:29:25] honestly I didn't know anything about our nation's nuclear treaties not a bit but what I did
[01:29:30] know and I told him this too was how to get the right people into a room and how to run the decision
[01:29:35] making process I knew how to figure out what motivated people how to get them to generate ideas
[01:29:42] how to cooperate and ultimately how to leave the room with the best possible outcome I wasn't
[01:29:48] afraid to admit that I didn't know a thing about nuclear policy and I think that's what got me the job
[01:29:55] being humble enough to admit that being humble enough to admit what you don't know but still
[01:30:00] confident enough to explain where you can add value is a balance that's often hard to strike
[01:30:06] but you need to recognize that it's a strength not a weakness to know what's beyond your knowledge
[01:30:11] or understanding at any point in time instead of pretending otherwise I walk into any room and
[01:30:17] always assume that people in it are smarter than I am faster than I am and more agile than I am
[01:30:22] that way I can never be wrong I never assume I have the idea I have an idea maybe it's the best one
[01:30:30] or maybe it's not but honestly it shouldn't even matter because our job in any room is to find
[01:30:35] the best answer for the problem we're working on no matter who's answer it is we have to listen to
[01:30:41] each other and really hear each other and the best way to do that is to walk into the room knowing
[01:30:47] there's no doubt that everyone in there has something useful to say so that's how you ended up with
[01:30:54] that job not by being this not by being the smartest guy about nuclear treaties but by saying hey
[01:31:00] look I don't know everything about that but I can help make a decision it's it's exactly what you
[01:31:05] talk about in extreme ownership it's it's the exact same way we've grown up in the seals and
[01:31:10] just espousing that for sure so you're working at the White House so what's this job what's the
[01:31:16] first job that you get when when you get there as a White House fellow what's the first job well
[01:31:21] the White House Fellowship is has kind of like three legs of the stool as an active White House
[01:31:26] fellow you're you're wearing a suit to work every day it's not a it's not a uniform job
[01:31:31] and so the program has places you in a full-time job throughout the year and some people opt
[01:31:38] into a job that's a little bit more a little bit more fellow E meaning you don't have really
[01:31:44] that many obligations you're there to learn you just get to observe and I'm like you know I
[01:31:48] want to really get in the mix you know so I had opportunities at department of commerce and I
[01:31:52] had opportunities at National Security Council and so I thought do I go deeper in something I
[01:31:56] know National Security do I go to commerce and learn something new and ultimately you can't pass up the
[01:32:02] the the role where you're going to be in the West Wing and be just in the mix with the nation's
[01:32:08] hardest problems and so that so so with that the Fellows also get together though a couple of times
[01:32:15] a week and you listen to you know cabinet secretaries the Vice President the the President and
[01:32:21] and so on and just ask them questions and you learn it's all off the record and 14 Fellows plus
[01:32:27] the President or 14 Fellows plus the Vice President and it's just a tremendous program but you're
[01:32:32] really if you pick a job that is a real a job with real responsibilities it's a hard year.
[01:32:40] When you see the news now and I mean I guess it's just like seeing like a movie about like a military
[01:32:46] movie how you and I will watch a military movie and it's like oh that would never have an oh that's
[01:32:50] another thing how is it for you now you look you look at what's happening in the White House and you
[01:32:56] know all these inner workings of what's going on behind the scenes what does it what it give us a
[01:33:00] little glimpse of what it's like going on behind the scenes. Yeah you know I think the real thing
[01:33:05] that is not sexy is process but process is what accelerates outcomes and so when you think about
[01:33:11] it there are 17 acres of the White House but there are but Jillians of different decisions that
[01:33:17] need to be made and so not everybody can bring their decision to the top of the house and so at my
[01:33:22] level I ran a certain meeting in the in the White House situation room and it's it's simple it's a
[01:33:29] binary outcome you know with it's either we agree in which case national policy is made or if not
[01:33:37] then we we sus out what is what are the different stakeholders think what is the department of
[01:33:42] state or department of defense or energy or the intel community think and and why can't we compromise
[01:33:47] and so by definition only the harder issues are bubbling up to then a deputies committee meeting where
[01:33:52] the number two runs it again binary outcome at a deputies committee meeting they either agree
[01:33:57] and make policy or not and then it becomes a principles committee meeting where you have the national
[01:34:01] security adviser chairing it and you've got the sec death the sec state all of the the number
[01:34:07] ones of all the departments and agencies around the table again binary outcome agree or not
[01:34:12] if agree great policy made if not that's going to the president and so by definition you've created
[01:34:18] a system where you get volume and flow but only but only the hardest things are making it to the top
[01:34:24] sometimes that runs well sometimes that doesn't run well and so as I sit back you know I think about
[01:34:31] you know how are things working are they working like they can or should as soon as decisions
[01:34:35] get made outside of that process you you you you actually diminish the probability of the best
[01:34:44] possible decision getting made because you know as well as I do if not everybody's at the table
[01:34:48] and you make a decision you've kind of alienated a bunch of stakeholders and you don't get
[01:34:52] everybody rolling in the same direction so that's kind of the lens that I look at at Washington DC
[01:34:57] and you know I think sometimes we're we're way more broken than we should be but other times
[01:35:02] I think you know it's it's you've seen the smartest mine solve some of the really hardest problems we have
[01:35:07] we have a lot to be proud of and we have a lot to work on in this in this nation so what which meeting
[01:35:13] is it that you would run you said well every of all these meetings which which one where you which
[01:35:18] level of meetings would you run so every administration changes the name a little bit just because
[01:35:24] they need to you know put the their own stamp on on what it's called but a policy coordinating committee
[01:35:29] was what it was called in the Bush administration as an example a PCC I think it was if I'm I'm
[01:35:34] I didn't even be wrong on that but a three three letter acronym that was you know something that
[01:35:38] changes but but but but the point is I'd be at the head of the table and you'd have basically
[01:35:43] assistant secretary level people or you know roughly two three star-ish generals from the
[01:35:50] from the Department of Defense you know just whoever this day called there was for the
[01:35:54] particular issue some people from under secretary defense and the policy shop sitting there and
[01:35:59] and look I'm not trying to glorify myself or be the president of fan club I'm a guy who ran the
[01:36:04] process but the thing is that's that's the role if you can run the process really well
[01:36:08] then it makes the nation run well you know and you know you know I've been often asked
[01:36:14] a little bit of a segue here but you know hey as we got out of Afghanistan what went wrong
[01:36:18] the thing that went wrong was policy process broke down who are we bringing home we didn't
[01:36:23] have a question answer to that question and so that caused a lot of chaos and a little a lot of
[01:36:27] people rush to an airport hoping to get onto a flight you know so anyways that that's just one
[01:36:33] example of the how policy the the engine and the machine should work how many hours a day
[01:36:39] are you working in those long hours that was you know I'd get in it you know I always get my
[01:36:45] workout in the morning I honestly got there you know 737 eight clocks and like that but but it was
[01:36:50] home at 10 o'clock on a lot of nights and then a lot of times you know paying attention to the
[01:36:56] blackberry I'll date myself oh 708 oh nine time frame and in fact I remember very well one night
[01:37:04] at three in the morning the blackberry just buzzing nonstop which usually didn't wake me up but it
[01:37:09] did this night and that's where the guy captain Richard Phillips got uh got uh taken hi it was
[01:37:14] hijacked on the mayor's gallabama and then I called a friend of mine Chris Demensick who was at
[01:37:21] at at team six and said hey man a million layers between you and me but you gotta go start
[01:37:26] looking at this right now and and you know hours later I'm in my suit in the basement of the
[01:37:31] Pentagon and the NMCC the National Military Command Center and just trying to work the problem and
[01:37:36] and ultimately ran that I ran that whole thing from the the national security council and
[01:37:42] one of the cooler things was you know running these meetings and you know President Obama
[01:37:46] would walk in and there's only about only about four or five six of us kind of running this this
[01:37:50] this situation and when the whole thing was done President Obama wrote a really nice note
[01:37:56] on White House Stationary Mike great job on the Somalia situation you made a family very
[01:38:02] happy at Easter Baroque. Yeah that's pretty cool. Yeah you have a little little section here
[01:38:08] that thought was pretty cool talking about that as this is going down you get these you get these
[01:38:13] uh text or whatever the the Blackberry's buzzing you say I called the Pentagon and a one star
[01:38:19] animal who is on duty told me that his guidance was not to prepare any options to deal with
[01:38:23] the situation. I responded with something I said only twice in my two years in my position at the
[01:38:29] National Security Council. quote Sir please take this as direction from the White House and quote
[01:38:37] I told him that the Department of Defense needed to prepare military options to rescue the crew
[01:38:41] and keep the pirate capers from selling Captain Phillips to Al Shabbab or another terrorist
[01:38:46] organization. The only question I said to the Admiral is how fast can you have options back to
[01:38:52] the National Security Council. By the afternoon my biggest worry had become real. The pirates had left
[01:38:57] the ship putting the crew putting the crew out of danger but they had taken Captain Phillips with them
[01:39:02] and were holding him hostage on a lifeboat heading toward shore fortunately by that point
[01:39:07] the Department of Defense had done what it does best and was giving the National Security Council
[01:39:11] and the President real options to address a really hard problem. My friend my friend Scott
[01:39:17] commander of the entire task force being deployed for the mission and Chris a leader of the
[01:39:22] tactical response itself arrived on scene halfway around the globe in a matter of hours after the
[01:39:27] mission was launched they inverted a crisis on Easter Sunday as they shot three pirates with three
[01:39:32] rounds in the dark and night while both their ship and the pirates lifeboat rocked up and down
[01:39:37] on the swells of the open ocean. Scott Chris and their snipers were the true heroes of that day.
[01:39:45] It's no different than third phase of Buds. Do you remember when we're thinking
[01:39:48] we're we're we're told think about what can go wrong on your mission.
[01:39:52] Yeah. Think forward what are all the things that can happen? So it's not like I was
[01:39:56] anybody special in the White House. I was just doing what I grew up with and the seal teams
[01:39:59] it's the same thing you or any other you know seal leader would have done which is hey this
[01:40:03] can actually go bad and here's how it can go bad and we're going to prepare for the worst case not
[01:40:07] the best case. Have you been to the UDTCL Museum and Fort Pierce Florida? Not lately but but I have
[01:40:12] they have they have the lifeboat there. Yeah. I don't know if you know that you have to
[01:40:15] welcome myself. Yeah that's pretty awesome. That's pretty awesome. Group doing pretty awesome stuff there.
[01:40:23] So that's so that's this White House fellow position and you that's an interesting
[01:40:28] going from George W. Bush to Barack Obama. What do you notice about those two leaders?
[01:40:34] First of all great governors of people and great leaders in different ways. You know the
[01:40:44] the press has a certain view and a certain lens on things and having been on the inside
[01:40:48] I'll just it's really obvious statement but just don't believe everything you see you read.
[01:40:53] So that was another great set of lessons that what came out of that two years in Washington DC
[01:40:57] for me the White House fellowship was supposed to only be a year but after that Captain Phillips
[01:41:01] thing President Obama said hey can you stay my whole administration. So I stayed at state a second
[01:41:05] year and continued in my role but you know the at really at the end of the day it was about
[01:41:16] about seeing an administration in year seven and a half is a lot different than an administration in
[01:41:21] minute one and so people can think about oh the right and the left. For sure that can there's
[01:41:26] of course policy differences not as many national security ironically once you get briefed up
[01:41:31] and you're really like in the T the TSS CI top secret sensitive apartment information of like
[01:41:36] what's happening in the world politics actually causes the the opinions to narrow a good bit because
[01:41:42] there's only so many solutions to the national security problems but the the thing I would say is
[01:41:48] setting aside right and left issues it's really an energy you know you're seeing the third or
[01:41:55] fourth person in the role at year seven and a half of an administration and you're seeing somebody
[01:41:58] else on minute one who's got incredible energy and they're just happy to be they're happy to be there.
[01:42:04] They might not know where the lights which is are for the first few weeks but but it's um but that's
[01:42:08] the beauty of the the permanent staff that that kind of works as part of the institution in DC
[01:42:17] and I've always felt you know people will complain that nothing ever changes
[01:42:22] well there's some positivity to things being hard to change in our government.
[01:42:28] Would you say that's an accurate assessment? A 300% like I don't want the government to be at the
[01:42:34] whim of whoever's in charge to just whip it one way or the other. No I think our nation's four
[01:42:39] fathers made it easy to kind of bump down the the the highway but not to get off the road.
[01:42:46] Awesome hard so you wrap that up and and while you're there is this when you figure out that
[01:42:51] you're gonna go to a sealed team to as the CEO. It is and you know it's handling Afghanistan policy as well
[01:42:56] and Scott Moore was the detailer the Scott that you just referred to in the in the previous
[01:43:01] passage and he said hey Mike you're gonna you're gonna take over sealed team too can you get yourself
[01:43:05] out of the White House like we can't pull you out like you're the only one who's gonna have to you know and of
[01:43:09] course that after two years I was ready for my next challenge and ultimately got permission to leave and
[01:43:16] I said I've got a great opportunity of and I knew I'd be deploying back to Afghanistan because
[01:43:23] as you well know the naval special war for community doesn't frequently get real estate to own
[01:43:29] and so we had southeast of Afghanistan and it was a great opportunity to not just take a
[01:43:35] sealed team overseas but to integrate a bunch of you know green berets a bunch of you know
[01:43:40] you know infantry from the army and just every single aspect of of what the what the nation's
[01:43:46] Department of Defense really is. Yeah what's that what a huge what a huge step for the community
[01:43:53] you know I was talking to animal Richards and and those guys that had this sort of vision that we
[01:43:59] should be deploying in that in that even with the idea that we should be deploying like that like
[01:44:05] as a team CEO deploying overseas like that was those guys came up with this idea and thankfully
[01:44:11] they came up with it before September 11th it they kind of it wasn't there yet I mean what was
[01:44:16] remember vision 2000 like that that was them trying to formulate this idea but yeah this is an
[01:44:22] example of how well that actually worked the opportunities that we're there. Yeah so so awesome
[01:44:29] and so exciting as a commander of a sealed team to be able to bring your whole team overseas to one
[01:44:33] to one effort and to make a meaningful impact. Yeah I mean for just so everybody knows for
[01:44:39] pretty much for the entire history the sealed teams it was going to be one season two z's
[01:44:44] a platoon going here maybe a couple platoon's going there and that was what they did in Vietnam it was
[01:44:50] like one or two platoons at a time deploying the sealed team commander was pack and coronado or back
[01:44:56] in Virginia Beach and they were just kind of watching and and then to have this idea that actually a
[01:45:02] sealed team the whole team should be able to deploy and then the team should be able to take on
[01:45:07] other assets and utilize those assets I mean it's we got to be very thankful for those senior
[01:45:12] leaders that came up with that plan for sure totally agree and I would say that you were you
[01:45:17] were definitely a benefactor of those things couldn't be couldn't be more accurate so so appreciative.
[01:45:24] So you show up at a team what was your attitude coming back to the team? Oh fired up man to
[01:45:28] like get out of the White House and we're in a suit every day for two years I was ready for some sand and
[01:45:34] in surf zone. You show up and the work up anything particular that you guys focused on during the
[01:45:41] work up. Well you know we of course knowing it's a real benefit to also know you're
[01:45:46] really preparing for Afghanistan and you get to not prepare for a bunch of different things and
[01:45:51] so we minimize you know hate to say this but we minimize diving we had to make hard decisions like
[01:45:56] we're not going to be diving in Afghanistan let's not go spend three weeks diving it just doesn't
[01:45:59] make sense and and yes it kind of moved us away from our roots a little bit but that was that was
[01:46:05] that's what commanders do is you make the those types of decisions and so for me I was really moved
[01:46:11] when I went overseas I went to Afghanistan to spend a couple weeks out in theater early on in command
[01:46:18] and you know I was there when we lost three seals in a helicopter crash out in Zabl province
[01:46:24] and of course terrible terrible incident you know being there really left of serious mark on me
[01:46:32] I mean of course you know I'd been exposed to everything already in my career but when you really
[01:46:36] feel that you feel that you are the owner of the risk of the whole team it's a different feeling
[01:46:43] there's a I used to think when I was second in charge of a seal team that it wouldn't really be
[01:46:48] that different to be overall in charge I couldn't have been more wrong so when I when a senior leadership
[01:46:55] team from from seal team to did our advanced reconnaissance if you will we came home on a
[01:47:03] meta-vac where I'll never forget there was a young man who was blown up in an IED who was really
[01:47:10] just being flown to Germany just so he could pass away in Germany next to his wife he was in a coma
[01:47:15] and I'll never forget like a you know six or eight hour flight just spending it next to this whole
[01:47:20] guy just my hand on him talking to him and just some army trooper who I don't even don't even know
[01:47:25] his name but like when you're really around that I got back to the states and I I already worked hard
[01:47:31] but I worked like it really stepped up the like this is real like I will bring all my guys home
[01:47:38] and and and we'll do everything we can yeah those we we experience that going getting to
[01:47:52] a body like as soon as we get there there's there's soldiers and Marines get killed just about
[01:47:56] every day and and we would go to those services whenever we could but it was out of the gate we were
[01:48:01] hating two three services in a row and it's a wake up called everybody to the recognition of
[01:48:09] what's going on out in that battlefield every single day which which you know you could hear it going
[01:48:13] on you could see it going on you could see vehicles you could see guys getting cows are backed out
[01:48:18] we were given blood whenever we could get blood like just that heavy reality of going to these scenarios
[01:48:25] um you guys you guys finish your work up you go on that that pre-depollement and now you got your
[01:48:36] platoon your your team over there your whole team never mind just the platoon now you got the whole
[01:48:41] team and it's not just your team that's you got SF guys you've got you've got an entire like force here
[01:48:48] it sounds like from the book you you had a little bit of a rough relationship with the conventional
[01:48:53] commander that was there initially with the one who was right next to me in Terran Coutt this guy just
[01:49:00] didn't want to get out and put his force at risk to go do great things and you know as well as I do
[01:49:06] you just you just don't respect people that don't want to do their job so uh that being said
[01:49:14] your your determined and you're gonna go make things happen you got some you got your you got your
[01:49:19] pltunes your teams your forces still out there still getting after it but you got to know when it's
[01:49:31] time to not get after it got to know when it's time to push back you got a thing here that's a
[01:49:37] really good lesson and it's a really good lesson and you do this in the book you counter it to the time
[01:49:41] with when the major told you in Kosovo was a Kosovo to stay out in the field and you go you know
[01:49:48] what we're just gonna stay out in the field like you told us you know well that that seems like the
[01:49:53] right call right now there's a little bit different here um going to the book to ensure civilian
[01:49:58] casualties where's limited is possible and that the innocent afghan civilians wouldn't turn against
[01:50:04] our forces the military set up a policy called boots on the ground battled damage assessment
[01:50:11] this meant that after every bomb we dropped we were we were required to physically go to the site
[01:50:18] to confirm that no civilians had been killed the theory a smart theory was that knowing we would have
[01:50:24] to acknowledge civilian casualties would make it less likely that there would be any civilian
[01:50:29] casualties a talented team of army green berets within my command had intelligence at one point
[01:50:35] that there were approximately 10 Taliban members gathered together at three in the morning
[01:50:41] in an area no civilian would ever go and certainly not at that time the team used
[01:50:47] surveillance techniques to view the site and we knew as a certainty that there were no civilians there
[01:50:54] they asked me for permission to drop a bomb from an unmanned aircraft and following the decision
[01:50:59] making process I'd put in place I granted it they went ahead and eight of the Taliban fighters
[01:51:06] were killed an army colonel from the commanding general staff in afghanistan called and asked
[01:51:12] my watch officer for our BDA report and my watch officer explained that we didn't have one that it
[01:51:18] was simply too much risk for not a good enough reason the road to the site was too dangerous to travel
[01:51:25] and we knew there were no civilians present and to ask anyone on my team to go down this isolated
[01:51:31] path in the middle of the night was an unnecessary risk to their lives and one it made no sense to take
[01:51:37] I got on the phone with the carnal and we went back and forth this is the policy but the policy
[01:51:44] in this case makes no sense to achieve an already known outcome I will not take unnecessary risk
[01:51:50] that my men will die there are consequences in the military for not following the orders of a
[01:51:55] superior truth is the lack of organizational flexibility is a huge problem for the military on the
[01:52:02] ground we were living a never agile enough kind of life but in terms of the larger hierarchy the
[01:52:07] structure had its weaknesses I could have been fired and sent home from the appointment as an
[01:52:13] in subordinate but in that moment I couldn't I couldn't just blindly follow the policy I had to
[01:52:20] act consistently with my values and make a judgment and subsequent decision that I was going to be
[01:52:26] able to live with if the worst happened the carnal said that since I wouldn't comply he was going
[01:52:33] to report my noncompliance to his boss the commanding general in Afghanistan and that he would
[01:52:38] ask his peer in charge of our Afghan partner force to order his men to unilaterally inspect the site
[01:52:45] instead I urged him not to do that but that decision was out of my hands 12 Afghan soldiers drove
[01:52:53] down that isolated road in three vehicles to make their assessment of the bomb site the first two
[01:52:59] trucks hit an IED and three V8 people in those two vehicles were killed with others seriously wounded
[01:53:06] soon after I flew by helicopter to the outstation where the green beret turned team was stationed
[01:53:11] sat with them and told them how incredibly proud I was of their amazing bravery their remarkable
[01:53:17] work they did night after danger snite it was one of the more emotional moments in my life
[01:53:22] as we started our meeting silence fell over the room and one of the guys on the team opened
[01:53:26] by looking me square in the eyes and quietly but resolutely thanking me he knew that the
[01:53:32] easier decision would have been caving to the pressure from above and deviating from my beliefs
[01:53:38] and we all knew that would have meant some of the men in this room would have died
[01:53:43] the green beret had no idea that his words made my throat almost closed as I choked up
[01:53:48] and how hard I had to fight off tears I was simply overwhelmed by the real life impact by the
[01:53:55] reality of the situation the overwhelming magnitude of these kind of decisions made under the
[01:54:00] pressure of intense nightly combat take a toll on people that's difficult to understand for those
[01:54:06] who haven't experienced it now with the benefit of several years of hindsight and the time
[01:54:11] to fully reflect on those past events I haven't even even greater belief in the importance of
[01:54:16] process your own process and a values based decision making process can no exaggeration save
[01:54:25] people's lives yeah um a point I like to bring up in situations like this is if you're in a
[01:54:42] leadership position and someone below you in the chain of command is refusing to do something
[01:54:49] or pushing back that hard you should probably listen to them and this is a situation I mean
[01:54:57] when as I was reading this as soon as I saw you know it go to oh he's gonna order someone else
[01:55:04] to address those I already knew the outcome because I know you're not pushing back
[01:55:08] for no reason you're pushing back for good reason it might be hard for people to understand
[01:55:17] that kind of pressure that you're under to kind of concede and just go with what you're being told
[01:55:21] to do there's times in life you gotta just put it on the table and say be ready for the
[01:55:26] outcome be ready to be fired you always hear pick your battles this was unquestionably one of them
[01:55:33] and this is why you are in command and this is why that's is everything that you've trained to do
[01:55:39] at that point in life is for that it's for a moment like that it's to have confidence in yourself
[01:55:44] that you're that you're right and to not take that unnecessary risk I still get you know emotional
[01:55:49] as you were reading it I haven't you know I you know I sit back and I can very tactily feel
[01:55:57] sitting in that room in the silence and me looking at all these guys and really knowing that
[01:56:03] that me having the backbone saved you know several of their lives and not not be able to look at
[01:56:09] which guy wasn't there or which guy you know it would have been but it's just the weight of combat
[01:56:15] gets really hard over time and and there's certain moments like that where you just say to yourself
[01:56:20] this shit is real how long was this deployment that was ten months that's a long deployment
[01:56:31] for seals it is what was there was was were we correcting a deployment cycle or something like that
[01:56:36] was it one of those things what happened we were just trying to stretch our forces more get more out of
[01:56:40] the forces we had so lengthen it out a bit and and then you could put more people on the battlefield
[01:56:45] and that it was not more complicated than that sometimes NSW's had to kind of make adjustments
[01:56:52] and extend someone and cut someone else short but it wasn't that hard we're just trying to
[01:56:57] know it was it was a line with the you know there were a line with the command leadership structure
[01:57:04] for the joint special operations task force throughout Afghanistan there were you know five
[01:57:09] different regions if you will so I was southeast but there was also you know obviously south and west
[01:57:14] and that was the cycle that the that the special operations community was on and so if the
[01:57:20] seals wanted to you know play the game and have the the battle space you just had to
[01:57:25] acquiesce and do the ten months you can't get off cycle with the rest of the rest of the force but
[01:57:29] yeah decisions like that very frequently and literally life and death what was your kind of
[01:57:38] battle rhythm your your personal battle rhythm during that deployment like what what time are you
[01:57:44] going to sleep what time are you waking up is there any rhythm jaco i had no rhythm you know i had
[01:57:48] a red light my ceiling that was anytime there was it was a tick troops in contact you know my
[01:57:53] my bedroom was about a thirty yard sprint down this like you know plywood palace kind of hallway
[01:57:59] to get to the the the the the the the operation center the the the antithesis of the the
[01:58:06] talking a rucksack that you talk about at the beginning you know we had the we had the plasma
[01:58:10] TVs and the terrain mapping and the unmanned aerial vehicle feeds and everything and and you know
[01:58:14] you you would just get the the the calls that you know you you hear the the crazy machine gun
[01:58:20] fire coming in over the over the satellite radio and you hear one of your your key leaders whose
[01:58:25] voices you know immediately even though they're not saying their name on the on the on the sat calm radio
[01:58:29] and they're just calmly saying what they need it's a it's a I need a 500 pound jdm drop like yesterday
[01:58:35] on this particular location and and and I was the one to make the decisions on when we drop
[01:58:41] bombs and when we didn't and when operations we went on what we didn't and so because I had I don't
[01:58:46] know is roughly 25 different outstations throughout the southeast and sometimes literally I think
[01:58:50] the five six seven different elements in a ticket a time I was I was just I was just on
[01:58:57] did you were you the approval for yeah I was the approval for air yeah
[01:59:02] yeah so you're busy yeah I mean we I don't know I don't think I've ever said this number
[01:59:08] publicly but it's it's not you know a secret but we had over 1100 air to ground drops over 10
[01:59:15] months and I'm in proud to say we didn't harm anybody we shouldn't harm there were times that we
[01:59:19] that we said no it wasn't a lot but but you know the mostly the leadership in the field new
[01:59:25] when not to ask for something but occasionally there were times it came up when when I said no and
[01:59:29] I just wasn't comfortable with something and so the the other thing that's interesting when
[01:59:34] you ask about the battle rhythm though is that it was also important to me to go out on some
[01:59:38] of the operations with the guys and I didn't go out quite as frequently as I did in Iraq but I
[01:59:42] still got out maybe once a week or something like that and I didn't do that in the beginning of
[01:59:47] the deployment because I wanted is the the staff to kind of see the the judgment the decision making
[01:59:52] etc but I did an incredible excel rocky Russell and who I would super supreme confidence in so I
[01:59:59] I'd go out on an operation and be with the the the Afghan commandos in a seal platoon for I don't know
[02:00:04] a day and a half two days at times and that's a that's a tough decision also because as soon as you
[02:00:09] swing and go on one operation with one unit dude you don't know what's happening with the other 24
[02:00:16] so that takes an element of like confidence and trust but of course as you know it makes you a
[02:00:20] better leader because it helps you understand and maintain perspective and frankly just to share
[02:00:24] the same risk as the guys you know and and as of whatever I'm 51 now is a 41-ish year old
[02:00:30] seal team commander you know that deployment we got shot at and rocketed and the the I cut one of
[02:00:37] my guys legs off on that deployment and just wanted to have this. There was somebody in an IED who
[02:00:45] was blown up and we had a mass casualty situation and so you know it was it was we had you know doctors
[02:00:52] but they were busy and you know I was kind of under it wasn't like I did it on my own the doctor
[02:00:56] kind of said hey okay do this do this do this and cut this and you know go and and because it was a
[02:01:01] it was an all hands on deck kind of thing in the in our in our in our headquarters at the
[02:01:08] it was kind of like the mass unit if you will you know oh so you had you had casualties come into your
[02:01:14] location yep and it was a mass casualty yeah it was yeah and so you were there freaking they were like
[02:01:21] scrubbed up getting it getting it on I don't even think we scrubbed it I mean we you know we we did
[02:01:27] it I don't remember perfectly but I just remember we didn't I met this guy at the helicopter who
[02:01:32] had three turnicots on and one of them was had come loose and yet arterial bleeding coming from
[02:01:38] the middle of his leg that was missing and I had to you know reach in and hold pressure on arterial
[02:01:43] bleeder and take him from the helicopter and get him all the way into the get him all the way into
[02:01:47] the medical unit and there was another guy who was I mean blown up beyond recognition but I mean
[02:01:53] I knew who was of course but I mean it was just it was really really bad and and then it was just
[02:01:59] there were only a handful of seals in the in the the headquarters at the moment and you know
[02:02:05] the the tick was gone and so it was that was taken care of and so it was just all hands on deck
[02:02:10] and dealing with the medical situation and that was one night but there were several nights where
[02:02:14] we had overwhelming number of of people who were shot up or blown up that we were taking care of
[02:02:23] but somehow from your seal team from seal team too you guys made it through that deployment
[02:02:28] without losing anyone no one was killed in action yeah
[02:02:31] any other any other thing to wrap up on that deployment I think it's really the main it really is
[02:02:43] the inexplicable pace and and dedication that our entire entire department of defense has
[02:02:55] is is really remarkable you know it's you just get humbled every day to see how hard people
[02:03:01] work in the u.s. your conditions and you know both seals and green braise and and non-seals
[02:03:08] and non-green braise out in these hinterlands literally just not showering for months on and
[02:03:14] only eating the food that helicopters drop into them and just really putting country and others
[02:03:20] before self I just was constantly humbled to to be part of an organization with such great
[02:03:27] great Americans so you get home from that deployment and I'm gonna go to the book here
[02:03:41] I'd been home from Afghanistan just for just a few weeks when I found out that my replacement
[02:03:47] as commander of the special operations task force who had taken over my team
[02:03:54] finished when my team finished its deployment had decided to take his own life shooting himself
[02:03:59] with his pistol in his room in the bed I had slept in for the previous 10 months
[02:04:06] I was shocked and devastated he and I were good friends former roommates but classmates 20 years earlier
[02:04:13] we had come up the ranks together before we each got married and started our families we shared a
[02:04:20] house in Virginia Beach for three years we were inseparable in those days we had bonded over
[02:04:27] our mutual frustration at the pull-up bar during buds training one Saturday morning after we both failed
[02:04:33] the day before to come him anywhere close to matching the 15 to 20 pull-ups our fellow trainees were
[02:04:39] able to do we decided to go find a pull-up bar to practice on far away from the buds compound
[02:04:44] we're no one would stumble upon us despite a full night's sleep we were still struggling
[02:04:48] as we fought as we each fought through our fourth pull-up I can still see his face and here the
[02:04:54] chuckle in his voice as he turned to me and said world's finest right here he was loyal
[02:05:01] genuine a man who could find humor in absolutely anything another time in training we were so
[02:05:07] cold on a boat ride back to the compound after an icy swim that we found ourselves fighting
[02:05:12] over where to place one rubber fin that was shielding very small parts of us from the 49 winds
[02:05:19] there we were two grown adults seal trainees fighting over a tiny rubber fin to help make us a tiny bit
[02:05:27] warmer and we and just a little drop less miserable we stopped for a moment and realized what we
[02:05:33] were fighting over and we both just broke out in hysterical laughter it seemed like we were always laughing
[02:05:40] back then when I was deployed he would check in on my family and when he was deployed I would check
[02:05:46] in on his I would say that I trusted him with my life except that it was so much more than that
[02:05:52] as seals we have no choice but to trust everyone on our team with our life every minute of
[02:05:58] every day on the battlefield but when you bond with someone it's not so much about trusting them
[02:06:04] with your life it's about wanting them to be there in the trenches with you feeling better
[02:06:09] because you know they're right alongside you he was so much more than a fellow seal he was a friend
[02:06:15] a teammate a brother a shiny example of the bravery a human being can exhibit
[02:06:30] you know you talk about the pressure and the pace and the battle rhythm or lack of rhythm
[02:06:52] and the lives it's stake and it's it's it's hard to describe what that feels like
[02:07:06] and it's hard to it's hard to describe what it feels like I guess it's all I can say
[02:07:13] but man this was this was just a travesty and a shock
[02:07:17] to have the the commander on the ground who would just take in your place someone you grew up
[02:07:26] within the team somebody I was at team two with I mean just freaking good good mug
[02:07:31] it's it's so hard to understand yeah this one hurt they all hurt some of them hit closer to home
[02:07:48] than others you know as I know you've experienced too and you know this is this is the
[02:07:54] thing I was talking about and not describing well enough before but it's the
[02:07:59] it's the weight that people carry it's the it's the not not always knowing the weight that
[02:08:09] people carry and yeah this that was a tough one for me you talk a little bit in the book
[02:08:20] you know I mean obviously we all have the we all go through the you know what could I have
[02:08:25] done differently maybe I could have said this or seen that or done this or done that
[02:08:31] is there anything as you look back is there any pattern did you have any indication
[02:08:37] I mean you did a turnover I was looking um I was looking at there's an article in the New York
[02:08:43] times about this and there's a there's a there's a situation that you describe in the book where
[02:08:48] I guess the local afghans had gifted you some kind of a you know ceremonial head garment
[02:08:55] of some kind and he was with you and they kind of ceremonially gave him as well the same thing and
[02:09:01] and it's it's it's I don't know if you've seen this I'm sure you have but there's so you
[02:09:05] write about that in the book and there's a picture in the New York Times of of you in that there's
[02:09:10] the picture of when that happened and it for me was very tough to look at because I read it and I kind
[02:09:15] of imagined it and you know then then then I then I go on the New York Times I'm reading this article
[02:09:20] and I think oh there's the picture there's exactly what Mike was talking about um is there anything
[02:09:26] that you look at that you think we need to do a better job of looking out out for?
[02:09:33] Yeah well I mean let's start that with me right I think that you know we've grown up saying
[02:09:39] look we can always go blame the world at everything but guys like you and me grow up starting with
[02:09:45] ourselves and say what could I have done better and so when I look back at at this particular
[02:09:50] situation I've recalled very vividly on a Friday afternoon to a clock in the afternoon or so at a
[02:09:55] team picking up the red line and trying to dial him and just check on him and see how he's doing
[02:10:02] and there was a new policy where you needed a four digit pin or something like that and I was like
[02:10:06] oh the convict guys have already gone home I'm not going to bug them on a Friday afternoon and
[02:10:09] make them make my phone work I'll just call call overseas on Monday. Well that Saturday is when
[02:10:15] when he took his own life and I sometimes look back and say you know did I did I did I do enough and I
[02:10:22] certainly wrestle with that and it leads me to a lesson that I talk about which is
[02:10:29] not seeing intrusive as a bad thing you know it's it's a good thing to be intrusive in people's lives
[02:10:35] and to ask the question of like hey really how are you really doing have you ever considered
[02:10:41] harm to self is a hard question to ask and it's a little bit embarrassing sometimes to ask it
[02:10:47] but I'll take 99 embarrassing for the one yes I miss that here and I won't miss that again and since then
[02:10:54] since that happened I've had plenty of yeses where I've been able to to step in and it helped
[02:11:01] I certainly wish I could have helped more in the past. When you guys are doing a turnover the turnover
[02:11:08] I mean just to to so I really understand this is like just the commander of the team. It's the
[02:11:13] commander of team but also the turnover this is for a lack of a better word this is like the most intimate
[02:11:20] intellectual exchange you're gonna have with another human being in your life hey I've been on the ground
[02:11:25] I've been fighting these troops we've been at war I'm gonna give you everything I can to help you do the
[02:11:33] job I mean this is as close as you're gonna intellectually transfer information between two people
[02:11:40] and then plus on top of that you guys are brothers from buds and I mean as you're doing this is it is there
[02:11:48] any there's nothing there's no you know Jaco have never said this publicly the there's just one
[02:11:54] shred of little thing when I play back in my mind you know we didn't lose any Americans and in my last
[02:11:59] you know session with the leadership I celebrated that but the incoming team was also there and
[02:12:09] my friend you know pulled me aside afterwards and said hey that was you know really rough for us to
[02:12:14] set the bar to expect that we're not gonna lose anybody and and it turns out that that the leader
[02:12:21] from the East Coast seal teams had also pulled my friend aside and said hey listen just do the same
[02:12:28] thing Mike did just bring everybody home and and he had lost four guys in his first month and so I think that
[02:12:33] pressure of losing people and you know it's it's it just it didn't it didn't add up so I mean I don't say
[02:12:40] that's the cause but it's certainly unquestionably a contributor.
[02:12:48] Yeah yeah I actually remember turning over with the guys that took over for us in a
[02:12:55] modding I told them well because I had lost guys and I'm like it was a whole I remember thinking
[02:13:00] myself am I gonna say this yes I am you guys are gonna take casualties like you there's a 100
[02:13:06] percent chance you're gonna take casualties there's a 100 percent certainty that you're gonna take
[02:13:10] casualties and I mean I've talked to guys since then that were in that group then that task
[02:13:18] unit that relieved us and they were like that was the wake up call for them was holy shit like
[02:13:23] we got our we got the seal team commander of the task unit telling us we are a 100 percent
[02:13:28] certain gonna take casualties yeah but all you can do is look at wake up calls as fuel for
[02:13:38] improvement in the future yeah right and and that's how we you know both of us live our lives
[02:13:42] this way now is we do carry inexplicable weight and it's we're just here to make everybody
[02:13:47] else's lives better and and and what do we how do we make the the families who've
[02:13:52] born the cost lighter and better and how do we help the nation better learning from the things
[02:13:58] that we've learned you want one of the really heartbreaking things in the book that you write
[02:14:04] about was you're you're going to I guess were you part of the k-co team no I was home um you know
[02:14:12] on post-applement leave but but in in Virginia Beach and so being such a family friend we were we were
[02:14:17] of course you know we were one of some of the few in the house yeah and you're talking about
[02:14:22] on your way to let you know his wife and his family know what had happened you you you you
[02:14:28] call this a child psychologist and you you asked uh you said do we tell his daughter now the truth
[02:14:33] of what happened or do we wait until she's older so she can better understand it and the
[02:14:37] psychologist says you have no choice but to tell the truth now tough stuff I mean I'll never
[02:14:45] forget being in the house with my wife and daughter and I mean this merits a super quick story it's
[02:14:52] you know when I was overseas of course their family was checking on my wife and daughter and
[02:14:58] one of the things before I came home it was that my daughter made uh deployment box that had
[02:15:04] 10 months worth of note cards written out to her friend my my friends daughter and they said things like
[02:15:12] when you miss your dad going to his closet take out a shirt of his put it on and pretend it's a hug
[02:15:18] you know notes like that they say here's how you're gonna get through the deployment and so then
[02:15:22] you know just a month later or so me being there and seeing the deployment box that she had
[02:15:28] told me about which neither my wife nor I gave her the direction to go do that that was her
[02:15:32] entirely on her own and um sometimes you know the the the the kids and the wives and the spouses
[02:15:37] never get enough credit for for as strong as they are but being in that room and I'll still never
[02:15:43] forget her screams you know he said he'd come home and and then more importantly like my daughter
[02:15:49] being there and and consoling her friend who had just lost her dad it's these are these are
[02:15:54] weighty things man make sure you grow up fast
[02:15:58] how much longer after that did you decide you're gonna you're gonna retire
[02:16:08] I was really close at that point I was weighing it pros and cons in my head that's not what
[02:16:15] influenced me in any way I um I made I actually frankly can't recall if it was how soon after
[02:16:22] that I made the decision but you know it ultimately was about continuing to make a difference and
[02:16:28] and I was I was at year 20 and after being commanding off sort of a team I just felt like there's
[02:16:33] so much more to do in life and while it's awesome to be a seal and I'd already been privileged
[02:16:38] to run meetings in the situation room and like what am I gonna do like another six years and
[02:16:42] return to attend the meetings that I've already run you know so I was like let me just pivot and go
[02:16:47] spend a chapter of my life in the in the private sector which I'm 10 years into now and have been
[02:16:52] really fortunate and learn a ton and and at some point in my life I'll return in some capacity to
[02:17:00] serve this nation and I'm not sure what what former fashion that will take I really have no idea
[02:17:04] I just know that when you're open to service it will find you and the ways we serve now are genuinely
[02:17:10] doing things like writing books and trying to make a difference for gold star communities and
[02:17:13] just continuing to elevate the conversation. How was your transition when you retired? I know people
[02:17:21] asked me that time that question a lot and and I always give the advice of like hey when you get out
[02:17:28] you need a new mission because you've been on mission of super hyper focused on this one thing
[02:17:33] for your whole life for everything from how to freaking put your web gear together in the most
[02:17:38] efficient ways your magazines are on the right place for an off hand draw like all those little
[02:17:42] things that we are focused on for 20 years and then you get you go up through the ranks we're
[02:17:47] now you're focused on how can my platoon do this better how can my task do this better for you
[02:17:50] it's how can I do this better for my team how can I better support them and then one day in one
[02:17:56] day you clean out your locker your a civilian and I always tell guys hey man you gotta find a new
[02:18:02] mission and it sounds like you got all mission pretty quick when you got out did you did you already
[02:18:07] have that did you already have job set up when you retired yeah I did I was again I've been
[02:18:14] very fortunate because I had exposure that that few people are privileged to have whether it was
[02:18:18] the White House Fellows program or two years of of a pretty reputable graduate school and so you
[02:18:24] know I I didn't know what I would do when I made the decision to retire but I I had a lot of
[02:18:32] conversations to try to go find that thing I had great mentors and in ultimately you know had
[02:18:39] had offers at Goldman Sachs and at JPMorgan and at Bridgewater the hedge fund where I ultimately
[02:18:44] went good good really good front of mine Dave McCormack who actually just ran for Senate in Pennsylvania
[02:18:50] was in the Bush administration the the Treasury wall I was at the National Security Council
[02:18:54] but Dave is a a a good really good human and really good friend and just asked him for some advice and
[02:19:00] and and he ultimately created another option that I wasn't trying to create and I jumped into
[02:19:07] to Bridgewater with him and in a couple of other really great leaders and learned to turn there
[02:19:11] and that was my first chapter so look it's really it can when you look in the rear view mirror
[02:19:17] with transition you can say oh it must have been really easy no way man it's super freaking hard
[02:19:22] like because we're all planners you know in the teams we're not like we're not letting life just
[02:19:27] happen to us we're planning life and this is an element of time when you're like it takes patience
[02:19:32] to for the plan to come together it's not like you can plan harder and create things to happen
[02:19:38] in 12 hours and and man I'm bad at a lot of things but patience is definitely one of my weeks
[02:19:43] weeks spots you have this this section which I think kind of wraps up some of your transition here
[02:19:51] you say this I hear the question all the time how did you manage to move from the military to the
[02:19:55] government to the private sector when those arenas are so different from each other my answer is
[02:20:01] to premise the challenge or challenge the premise of this question of course there are different
[02:20:06] different details different specifics but the truth is in my experience all high stakes organizations
[02:20:11] and all high stakes decisions are pretty much the same the concrete knowledge you need is the
[02:20:18] easy part anyone can learn that but the details don't matter if you don't have the right process
[02:20:24] and if you do have the right process you can go anywhere it's why strong leaders are able to jump
[02:20:28] from one industry to another one organization to another so that's what you did apply to your
[02:20:36] your decision making process your your lessons learned from the military you applied to the
[02:20:42] government sector I guess and then to the to the civilian sector so you did bridge water for a few
[02:20:49] years and then you ended up actually entering the another business right with with cognizant
[02:20:56] yep and then what was that experience like well first all bridge water is a phenomenal place four
[02:21:01] years it is it is a crucible of of of talent that is all trying to be more talented and do great
[02:21:09] things in in markets and in ultimately how to manage the company so that they can outperform in
[02:21:13] markets and the mission is very simply to figure out what's going on in the world and how to
[02:21:18] how to capitalize on that for for their own investors you know police retirements and teacher
[02:21:25] retirements and you know sovereign wealth funds and things like that so I like the mission of
[02:21:30] figure out what's going on in the world right it's a large thing yeah it was so that they do quite well
[02:21:36] over their bridge water very well and and so but but after you know four years or so three and
[02:21:42] half four years I was ready to pivot and a really good front of mine started a company called
[02:21:46] cognizant he spun them out of uh done in Brad Street twenty-fut at the time twenty-five years ago
[02:21:51] and twenty-five years prior and then they had an activist investor take a billion six position
[02:21:56] in the stock and start agitating and and I just call them and said hey man here's what you need
[02:21:59] to be thinking about just this this and this and that the other thing and you might just come
[02:22:03] help me come help me run the company and I was like I'd never been at a large public company and I was like
[02:22:07] look let me bet on myself this is risky I'm not sure I'm gonna be great at this but I'm gonna go
[02:22:12] figure it out and it it's what you just read in the book and and honestly I think I did very well there
[02:22:17] and and I've continued to you know pivot I'm now running global operations and transformation and
[02:22:25] and uh security and real estate etc for for VMware it's a large software company and with with
[02:22:34] very public news right now about a potential acquisition or an acquisition again very public
[02:22:39] knowledge and and VMware is an awesome organization in so many different ways and and just bringing
[02:22:44] the same exact you know skill set if you will to VMware but with some of the knowledge that you
[02:22:51] that I've learned along the way the ten years so it's a combination of specific knowledge but also
[02:22:56] you know the the management skill of seeing forests and trees but definitely both.
[02:23:02] Yeah we've been my company excellent funds been working with VMware we've worked with VMware
[02:23:07] decent amount but the fun thing is for me the first time I worked with him was telling him hey
[02:23:12] I used to carry VMware stuff in the field and hook it up to my satellite radio and make
[02:23:19] columns and they were all pretty stoked and they got a good veteran community there really
[02:23:22] VMware so awesome company. Well you know and I forgot to mention the I know that the team thought
[02:23:30] incredibly highly of your and and Eshelon front's leadership and instruction and motivation and
[02:23:37] inspiration everything that you are that you espouse has made a huge positive impact on people and
[02:23:42] whenever that that finished up I think it was about a week ago or something like one of them was
[02:23:46] the most recent was about a week ago I got eat multiple emails saying hey this guy's awesome
[02:23:50] everything from like people who know that we know each other and others like hey you ever heard of this
[02:23:54] willing guy you know like yeah yeah I heard of right on so you got that going on in the
[02:24:00] Civilian sector that that chief digital transformation officer and at the me in the meantime you
[02:24:06] know you mentioned giving back and you are giving back and one of the things that you're doing
[02:24:13] which is incredible is this book that we've been reading through today this book which is called
[02:24:18] Never Enough you've taken all the profits from this book all the profits from this book and you are
[02:24:26] very specifically giving the profits to gold star families and very specifically in order to pay off
[02:24:35] their mortgages and this is you know home ownership is not only the American dream but it's also
[02:24:43] the American nightmare when you've got a mortgage to pay or when you don't have a place to live
[02:24:48] free if that comes under pressure there's just there's just a you know your home is your castle
[02:24:54] and so this idea and I'm not sure quite how you can't you probably can't have a conclusion the way
[02:24:58] I just spoke through which is listen if there's anything we could give a gold star family the best
[02:25:04] thing we can give them in terms of security and peace of mind is to say hey you can you don't have
[02:25:11] to worry about where you're going to live forever and so that's what you're doing with this and you
[02:25:16] know it's funny I was asking you well like is there a website we can put out or anything you're like
[02:25:20] nope it's not it's it's you're you're you even want to spend money on a website you you're like
[02:25:25] a hundred percent it all goes to buying these houses for gold star families and I personally know
[02:25:32] some of the people that you've done this for again I can't imagine a better gift to give a gold star
[02:25:38] family then the absolute peace of mind of here's a place for you to live and security for the
[02:25:44] rest of your life how did you get to that how did you get to that goal well it's thanks for sharing
[02:25:50] that I really appreciate that because that is really you know multiple goals with never enough one
[02:25:54] is to elevate the conversation but a very very tangible one is to literally pay off more pages like
[02:25:59] you describe and just from seeing firsthand the situations where you know the the government doesn't
[02:26:05] really cover nearly as much as as you would expect in in a situation where there's somebody killed
[02:26:11] an action or who dies by suicide and I just felt like there's a gap in the community there's plenty
[02:26:18] of fishing trips and mental health about like all very very good things but the most fundamental
[02:26:24] thing is for these families not to feel the pressure of needing to move from the communities that
[02:26:29] have hugged them for the previous one or 15 years of their lives and if you could you imagine being
[02:26:36] a gold star widow all of a sudden not that any of none of them make that choice nobody wants that
[02:26:41] title and and being pressure to leave your community like it's unfathomable to me and so I
[02:26:48] just really was fired up that we don't do more and so at this point we very very confidentially
[02:26:54] paid off six mortgages and I'm on a drive to do more and ultimately alleviate this burden for
[02:27:01] for really every one of these families that has experienced this and I wish we could wave
[02:27:05] a magic wand and do all of them all at once but look it's it's it's it's really what drives me
[02:27:12] in one of the ways that that I try to not I mean that I am giving back and if people want to help
[02:27:18] that cause I was real simple going by this book that's just that's how you help this cause hey look
[02:27:23] when you get awesome lessons cool we get some cool stories yes you will but you will you'll be
[02:27:28] able to help out these gold star families so freaking outstanding you're also you're also involved
[02:27:34] with the national Medal of Honor Museum so so tell me what's going on with that yeah great we
[02:27:39] I'm on the board of a museum that the nation hasn't built so about four years ago I got asked to
[02:27:46] give somebody some advice there was something that was a small local effort in South Carolina
[02:27:50] long story short they this person asked me to join the board I said you know like all of us are
[02:27:56] too busy don't have time excuse blah blah blah blah blah and and then for personal reasons
[02:28:03] after sharing a story back and forth I said okay you've got me I'll join the board on one condition
[02:28:09] we get to fire everybody who's on the board and we're gonna make this thing go national
[02:28:13] so we raised at this point a hundred and sixty five million dollars we've got about sixty
[02:28:18] million more to go we took us three years but we worked through a concept to city selection
[02:28:23] New York City offered us governor's island and Washington DC offered us a spot in the mall
[02:28:29] we ultimately did a bake-off between those plus Denver in our LinkedIn Texas we chose our
[02:28:34] LinkedIn Texas we're building the museum right next to AT&T Stadium we've got an incredible board
[02:28:39] we've got all of the ex presidents with the exception of of president Trump mostly from a timing
[02:28:44] perspective you know we're we're we have great momentum this is irreversible at this point
[02:28:51] of course not surprisingly the the CEO of the museum is my swim buddy that we've talked about
[02:28:56] Chris Cassidy he's a phenomenal American you know seal astronaut and now CEO of this museum
[02:29:02] and what we're really doing with this is we're on a mission to inspire America we will we will
[02:29:08] take the lessons that the metal of honor recipients have that that they espouse the character
[02:29:15] the values etc and and talk about that to make the nation greater and and the vision is for
[02:29:21] you know some young kid to see the brits LeBinsky and what he did and learn about his
[02:29:26] character values or you know strike brits name and replace it with any recipient and say
[02:29:31] how do I you know I'm seeing this little third third grade situation develop a I see a girl
[02:29:36] being bullied on the school yard how do I step in and go make this situation right that is what we
[02:29:42] we want to stop that or school shootings or or having the bravery the courage to step in during
[02:29:48] a school shooting and and stop the shooting from happening or just to make the make our nation
[02:29:52] stronger and better and the the premise is really to inspire America we will open in about a year and a
[02:29:59] half what we haven't to completely determine our opening date but this will be one of the nations
[02:30:04] if not them I should say the the premier museum for the nation that will tell the stories of the
[02:30:10] roughly 3500 recipients and 64 living recipients many of them many of whom you personally know and
[02:30:18] and just get their stories out there yeah that's that's just awesome I mean just the idea of
[02:30:24] giving people examples to read about and to be introduced to that they can try and follow in their
[02:30:31] footsteps at least be inspired by and yeah that's just that's just phenomenal I mean while
[02:30:38] I look on maybe a couple you I guess it was maybe a year and a half two years ago you you
[02:30:42] okay show me a text hey you know we're looking for a CEO of this of this the metal vanner
[02:30:49] museum thing if you know anybody let me know and I was like I racked my brain a little bit
[02:30:53] mom I definitely couldn't give you I couldn't have given you a candidate to do this crispy
[02:30:57] so that's that's that's an awesome guy to to to take the to take the lead on that and so
[02:31:03] did they did they start construction already yes was that when you were you doing the ground
[02:31:08] breaking ceremony when we were both yes pass weeks right this each other in the hotel by whatever
[02:31:13] an hour or something March 25th is Congressional Medal of Honor Day that's the day we broke
[02:31:17] around we had president Bush we had just we we had a lot like 17 or 18 of the living recipients there
[02:31:25] and yes that's when we we came like minutes from linking up with each other well that's awesome
[02:31:31] um does that bring us up to date on your life right now yeah absolutely I mean look I
[02:31:40] life is busy I can't sit still just like you can't it's all about giving back and and I really
[02:31:45] do appreciate for everybody out there just never pushing never enough I promise you it's it won't
[02:31:51] disappoint it's it's it's not been extreme ownership and therefore you can buy it a lot cheaper on Amazon
[02:31:57] so you but really do you appreciate that great support and if people people want to find you
[02:32:04] you have a website which is this is my case dot com you have Instagram which is this is dot my case
[02:32:13] you have Twitter which is this is my case and Facebook the real my case yeah so I don't know
[02:32:19] about you social media was foreign to me about a year ago but you know it's like like the disconfort
[02:32:25] leaning into discomfort it's it's it's part of the new the new us yeah it's definitely a very strange
[02:32:32] thing to go from zero social media and also being anti social media which we were absolutely
[02:32:39] had to be well you kidding me um but yeah it was I guess it was a combination it was it was
[02:32:47] life babbins wife Jenna who was like you got to get on social media I'm like no I think
[02:32:54] life life it makes me now you know where I'm like no we don't need it not doing it and then Jamie
[02:33:00] who who's the CEO of one of my companies is like you should really do this I'm like I don't think
[02:33:06] we need to and then Tim Ferris who said dude you better get on Twitter or your nitty it I was like
[02:33:10] all right time there's a bunch of people that are telling me to do this what's real I have to say
[02:33:15] you know it's really funny is of course I follow you and when you show the 404 30 wakeups
[02:33:20] I keep saying to myself I'm gonna get the exact same watch and set it for one minute earlier
[02:33:24] than you and take my picture and just show that my I'm a minute earlier than you every single
[02:33:28] morning but I just haven't had the energy to actually pull it off. Yeah there's there's been
[02:33:31] some campaigns on that I know Andy's dump for a while was he forget if he was waking up earlier
[02:33:37] or he was doing something something like that there's also a whole host to people that
[02:33:41] you know show their their watch at 1042 in front of a box of donuts and you know just got after it
[02:33:48] but yeah so that's where the people can find you echo you got any questions oh yeah real quick
[02:33:53] the no the fellowship program or your job at the White House how often do you see the president
[02:33:59] it depends on what role you're in the fellows get together a couple times during the year with the
[02:34:05] president and and have these candid off the record conversations and then if you're in a role
[02:34:12] like I was at the National Security Council sometimes it was three times in a week and then
[02:34:16] it'd be a month without seeing the president so a little bit varied depending on what was going on
[02:34:20] in the world. That's your rush yep that was easy one that's throwing softballs looking for the
[02:34:27] high and inside fastball from my control. That's just the only thing that you can eat what you'll
[02:34:31] know. Sorry for taking it easy for me. Awesome. Mike any closing thoughts? No just extreme appreciation
[02:34:39] I think that's maybe the next extreme appreciation besides extreme ownership but just so appreciate
[02:34:46] you and and all of our our community and the the nation for helping elevate the conversation
[02:34:53] and just recognizing that you know while we were in the service we're ultimately all here to
[02:34:57] serve each other and it takes different forms and fashions and I just encourage people to get off
[02:35:01] the sideline and serve in whatever way makes the most sense to everybody listening and just
[02:35:06] great appreciation for being here. Jocco it's a real um special day for me to be able to be
[02:35:12] shocking when we go from you know water polo and kill in each other are you killing me in the
[02:35:16] pool and then and this many years later seeing where we both are in life it's it's fun.
[02:35:21] Kind of crazy man well speaking of service thanks for your service to the country
[02:35:27] to the nation to the teams for what you've for what you've done in your past and for what you're
[02:35:34] doing today not only the civilian sector but more important for what you're doing today to take
[02:35:38] care of the families of our fallen teammates so thanks for coming out man sorry to because
[02:35:43] so while to get this together but appreciate it man. All good brothers my pleasure thank you Jocco
[02:35:49] thank you I could Charles and with that my case has left the building I go Charles yes sir
[02:35:59] key takeaways what do you got to go it's the one key takeaways kind of a reminder something that I guess
[02:36:05] yeah yeah I guess you talk about this but anyway he said on a few occasions process can save life
[02:36:12] the process because and it's one of those things where I'm personally I think I fall victim to this a
[02:36:18] lot of the time where I kind of I'm not used to having for lack of a living term or where like you
[02:36:27] know there I don't have any many I guess I do have some processes in place but sometimes I can put
[02:36:33] it this I can get distracted you can get the process I'm going to take joint warfare dude yeah
[02:36:38] I'm not saying I have all the processes for all things for sure but I get distracted from the process
[02:36:44] kind of easy even though I know that if I stick to the process the chances of success go way up
[02:36:51] exponentially and I think that's kind of like and I think about myself and I think how generally
[02:36:57] speaking this can be the case where if you allow that to happen like whether be because of stress
[02:37:01] because of you know just whatever kind of distraction or whatever that's that's how it works
[02:37:07] where if you just stick to the process you can keep yourself out of a lot of trouble even in like
[02:37:12] hectic kind of situation yeah and the dichotomy is sometimes you gotta get outside the process
[02:37:19] gotta be flexible you know it's people literally say think outside the box yeah so you got to
[02:37:25] know index with when it's say the sex of the process and when the yeah making adjustment yeah
[02:37:30] like the process can be somewhat flexible but the process is the process for a reason yeah it's like
[02:37:36] okay so think of it in terms like jiu-jitsu for example like when things start to get you know
[02:37:41] let's say I'm rolling with you yeah and you know you start turning up the heat on me all of a sudden
[02:37:46] for whatever reason that's going on in your head I can't get all panicky and start going off
[02:37:53] natural like instinct I gotta stick to the technique yeah seems saying sure I can turn on my
[02:37:57] urgency but I stick to the process which is the technique to get ideas stick to what you've learned
[02:38:02] like that can stuff that's that's a version of the process yep but there's also a situation where
[02:38:07] you might have to do something that's against the process a little bit jiffy-glover jiffy-glover will
[02:38:13] do some wild things yeah but if they're not it well I'm gonna get I can't read just mine yeah but
[02:38:19] I will say this the stuff the creative stuff that he does is all within the realm of jiu-jitsu that he's
[02:38:24] either learned or experimented no no because nowhere in jiu-jitsu does say like oh turn your back
[02:38:30] nowhere and it doesn't say that anywhere well that's his idea now I would say this and
[02:38:36] I'm not saying you're wrong necessarily but this is what I'm what about Pete the Greek
[02:38:39] going for wrist all the time okay so let's say that's still jiu-jitsu because what I'm saying
[02:38:43] so think of this I mean I'm talking about my focus on the rest I'm put it this way they're not
[02:38:48] doing this on rest lock they don't do that they don't do that because they get distracted or
[02:38:53] taking out of their game they do that voluntarily as part of the game yeah seems saying outside
[02:38:59] the process though is all I'm saying maybe that is within their process maybe they're
[02:39:03] probably telling you like no there's no process in jiu-jitsu seven years ago that said hey
[02:39:10] turn your back on the person on the person there's no no no one said that do you predict
[02:39:15] Jeffy Glover just did it I know you can't read just mine or Pete the Greek or anyone for that matter
[02:39:19] but would you say yes or no would you say that turning his back
[02:39:24] done out of creativity do you think that's part of his process
[02:39:27] I didn't say it wasn't part of his process as they part of the process
[02:39:34] all right so because you said trust love process and what I'm saying is okay your process
[02:39:40] and how about that okay trust your process hey if there's a process in place I'm saying
[02:39:44] if there's a process in place go ahead trust it yep to a significant degree to a significant degree okay
[02:39:50] and what I mean what I mean we can say what I mean and you just
[02:39:54] I'm saying don't get distracted meaning don't go on like if you start going all crazy hard
[02:40:00] is it beneficial for me to involuntarily go all crazy hard back yeah like that's trying to
[02:40:05] go kind of quite a fire is all they're like involuntarily and what's that like this well
[02:40:09] you're making it you're making me get all specific over here with though and his and all this other stuff
[02:40:14] on process right on yeah no point now right on no okay
[02:40:22] I'm trying to I'm trying to trust the process myself and you trying to make a point I'm trying
[02:40:27] not to ridicule it too hard yes there is process that's why we have standard operating procedures
[02:40:33] right and you gotta stay within those standard operating procedures to your point
[02:40:38] a lot of that time yeah but you can't get stuck in them so what complacency distraction panic
[02:40:43] these are all things that can make you deviate from the process yeah and then which kind of
[02:40:47] goes along to my secondary thing take away which is how and you guys but you can say this a lot
[02:40:53] all the time too it's like staying calm and really making it a point to stay calm which kind
[02:40:58] it can be rolled into the process right not only is it part of the process potentially it helps you
[02:41:04] stick to the process one should be all right so we're sticking to the process speaking to
[02:41:08] sticking to the process get yourself a subscription to a joint warfare let's say super curl yeah
[02:41:13] okay so the process is we're we're made and here's the thing too this is important follow me
[02:41:19] so in life life process no matter if you're no matter what your job career whatever you have
[02:41:24] certain things in life that if you do stick to don't get distracted complacent or panic about
[02:41:29] these things are gonna benefit you in life not only exponentially indefinitely working out
[02:41:36] reading and getting smarter keep it in open mind doing you just to yes part of the game for sure
[02:41:42] so when you work out can you solve some supplements to help you yeah working outside easy
