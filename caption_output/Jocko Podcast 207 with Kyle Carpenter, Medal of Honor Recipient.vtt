00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.38
This is Jockel podcast number 207 with Equatorals and me Jockel Willink

2
00:00:06.22 --> 00:00:08.22
Good evening, Eco good evening

3
00:00:09.72 --> 00:00:11.72
Now on

4
00:00:11.72 --> 00:00:13.72
podcast 203

5
00:00:14.72 --> 00:00:16.72
I had the honor of

6
00:00:17.68 --> 00:00:22.22
Having on some members of Kilo company 37 Reigns

7
00:00:23.92 --> 00:00:25.92
I had a Corporal Kelly Miller

8
00:00:25.92 --> 00:00:30.92
Sergeant Wild Bill William Hampton

9
00:00:32.92 --> 00:00:38.92
First Sergeant John Furg Ferguson and Lieutenant Colonel Trent Gibson

10
00:00:41.36 --> 00:00:43.36
And they came on the podcast to

11
00:00:45.76 --> 00:00:48.40
Share the story of their brother in arms

12
00:00:50.44 --> 00:00:52.44
Their fellow Marine Jason Dunham

13
00:00:52.44 --> 00:01:03.32
Who sacrificed his own life by smothering a grenade to save Kelly Miller and Bill Hampton on April 14th, 2004

14
00:01:07.44 --> 00:01:09.44
And he died of

15
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:15.44
His wounds eight days later on April 22nd, 2004

16
00:01:15.44 --> 00:01:22.44
And obviously that was an extremely hard podcast

17
00:01:25.44 --> 00:01:32.44
To record I know it was hard to listen to it's hard for them to recount their memories of Jason

18
00:01:35.44 --> 00:01:37.44
And of his life

19
00:01:37.44 --> 00:01:44.44
And of his death as well and it was hard for me to

20
00:01:47.44 --> 00:01:50.44
Watch as their emotions came to the surface and to see

21
00:01:52.44 --> 00:01:56.44
The anguish in their faces and hear

22
00:01:58.44 --> 00:02:01.44
The sorrow in their voices as they spoke

23
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:08.44
And it was also hard for me because I was thinking about Mikey Montsour

24
00:02:11.44 --> 00:02:15.44
Because on September 29th 2006 in the city of our Ramadi I rack

25
00:02:18.44 --> 00:02:23.44
Mikey who is one of my guys in tasking a bruiser at Seal Team 3

26
00:02:26.44 --> 00:02:28.44
He also jumped on a grenade

27
00:02:28.44 --> 00:02:32.44
To save three of our teammates

28
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:37.44
And he was also killed

29
00:02:41.44 --> 00:02:47.44
From this ultimate act of selflessness

30
00:02:47.44 --> 00:02:55.44
And both of those men posthumously received the Medal of Honor

31
00:03:00.44 --> 00:03:05.44
And the stories of Jason and Mikey were

32
00:03:06.44 --> 00:03:09.44
I mean they were definitely similar stories

33
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:14.44
And what the men of 37 kilo company went through

34
00:03:14.44 --> 00:03:21.44
And they were similar to what we experienced in tasking a bruiser

35
00:03:23.44 --> 00:03:27.44
From the morning of our brothers

36
00:03:28.44 --> 00:03:31.44
To the writing of the award citation

37
00:03:32.44 --> 00:03:35.44
To the ceremony at the White House

38
00:03:35.44 --> 00:03:42.44
The US Navy warships won named the USS Jason Dunham and won named the USS Michael Montsour

39
00:03:47.44 --> 00:03:50.44
And there's another similarity

40
00:03:51.44 --> 00:03:53.44
That's there that

41
00:03:56.44 --> 00:03:58.44
That can't be denied and that is that

42
00:03:58.44 --> 00:04:03.44
We all wish that we could have had one more

43
00:04:06.44 --> 00:04:08.44
One more conversation with these heroes

44
00:04:13.44 --> 00:04:15.44
One more chance to tell them

45
00:04:17.44 --> 00:04:22.44
About our lives now to tell them that we are not wasting the gift that they have given us

46
00:04:22.44 --> 00:04:32.44
One more chance to talk and smile and laugh with them again

47
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:40.44
One more chance to say thank you

48
00:04:40.44 --> 00:04:49.44
But we will not get that chance

49
00:04:53.44 --> 00:04:55.44
At least not in this life

50
00:05:02.44 --> 00:05:05.44
Because even though we remembered them

51
00:05:05.44 --> 00:05:08.44
They are gone

52
00:05:14.44 --> 00:05:18.44
And we can only imagine what they would say to us now

53
00:05:19.44 --> 00:05:21.44
Where they would be

54
00:05:23.44 --> 00:05:25.44
How they would explain their actions

55
00:05:25.44 --> 00:05:32.44
And what kind of miracle could have allowed them to survive

56
00:05:36.44 --> 00:05:38.44
And to survive something like that it

57
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:41.44
And absolutely would take a miracle

58
00:05:42.44 --> 00:05:45.44
For a miracle on top of a miracle on top of a miracle

59
00:05:45.44 --> 00:05:54.44
To survive a grenade blast at point blank range

60
00:06:01.44 --> 00:06:05.44
Well fortunately miracles do sometimes happen

61
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:10.44
And tonight on the podcast

62
00:06:10.44 --> 00:06:16.44
We have someone here with us that is the result of many miracles

63
00:06:18.44 --> 00:06:23.44
Miracles that unfolded after he did the same thing that Jason Dunham did

64
00:06:24.44 --> 00:06:28.44
The same thing that Mikey Montsour did he smothered her grenade with his body

65
00:06:29.44 --> 00:06:30.44
To save his friend

66
00:06:33.44 --> 00:06:35.44
His name is Kyle Carpenter

67
00:06:35.44 --> 00:06:44.44
And it is an honor and it is a miracle to have him here with us tonight

68
00:06:45.44 --> 00:06:48.44
Kyle, thanks for coming on

69
00:06:49.44 --> 00:06:50.44
It's awesome to meet you

70
00:06:51.44 --> 00:06:52.44
Thanks brother, you too

71
00:06:53.44 --> 00:06:56.44
To say it's an honor and privilege to be here with the end

72
00:06:57.44 --> 00:06:58.44
Understatement

73
00:06:59.44 --> 00:07:01.44
So I do appreciate this opportunity

74
00:07:01.44 --> 00:07:04.44
You know what I had, you know what I'm going to do

75
00:07:05.44 --> 00:07:08.44
Mike's really on and he's one of the guys that Mikey Montsour saved

76
00:07:09.44 --> 00:07:10.44
You know it's just

77
00:07:12.44 --> 00:07:15.44
We're sitting there with the guys from Keylo company

78
00:07:16.44 --> 00:07:20.44
And you just think in the whole time that man

79
00:07:21.44 --> 00:07:24.44
If I could just have one more conversation with your bro

80
00:07:25.44 --> 00:07:26.44
Just one more conversation

81
00:07:26.44 --> 00:07:30.44
And you know when I was reading your story

82
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:33.44
I mean obviously heard about your story but I want to

83
00:07:34.44 --> 00:07:37.44
Reading about your story, you know it's like I kept smiling to myself and saying

84
00:07:38.44 --> 00:07:42.44
Man this is this is that chance, you know this is that chance to talk to somebody

85
00:07:43.44 --> 00:07:48.44
That for all practical purposes there's no possible way that you should survive

86
00:07:49.44 --> 00:07:50.44
There's just it just doesn't make sense

87
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:54.44
That's why I use the term miracle and I know you use the in your book

88
00:07:54.44 --> 00:07:56.44
As well

89
00:07:57.44 --> 00:08:00.44
But to have you here sitting and be able to talk to you

90
00:08:01.44 --> 00:08:02.44
It's just

91
00:08:03.44 --> 00:08:05.44
It's amazing it's amazing to be able to sit here

92
00:08:06.44 --> 00:08:09.44
So thanks for making the journey and making the trip and coming out here

93
00:08:11.44 --> 00:08:14.44
And I just mentioned your book you got this book that just came out

94
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:18.44
It's called You Are Worth it

95
00:08:18.44 --> 00:08:24.44
And you don't whenever I have someone on I was kind of like to start

96
00:08:25.44 --> 00:08:31.44
I guess to start at the beginning you know kind of kind of figure out what people's backgrounds were

97
00:08:32.44 --> 00:08:40.44
Where they came from and you do a good job of that you know you actually you're second chapter in the book is called It's Starts at home

98
00:08:41.44 --> 00:08:43.44
And you go into your history

99
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:46.44
Sounds pretty sounds like you're pretty

100
00:08:46.44 --> 00:08:48.44
Let's just say an energetic kid

101
00:08:50.44 --> 00:08:52.44
Yeah, like a little five-year-old marine

102
00:08:55.44 --> 00:08:57.44
Yeah, you start off here

103
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:03.44
My dad will tell you that I had more confidence in any little any little kid in history

104
00:09:04.44 --> 00:09:08.44
When I was still a toddler I insisted he draw Superman logo on my chest with a marker

105
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:11.44
And not some weak washable marker that would come off in the bathtub

106
00:09:11.44 --> 00:09:17.44
No, I had to be the man of steel in permanent marker and I wanted the logo redrawn every time the ink started to fade

107
00:09:18.44 --> 00:09:22.44
Aside from my secret superhero identity, I was exactly like every other little boy in Mississippi

108
00:09:23.44 --> 00:09:25.44
I was fearless restless reckless and relentless

109
00:09:26.44 --> 00:09:30.44
A tiny blonde ball of energy you climbed up, left from played on rolled in ran around

110
00:09:31.44 --> 00:09:34.44
Or found a way to destroy whatever I possibly could

111
00:09:35.44 --> 00:09:38.44
And my dad and mom were thrilled about it

112
00:09:38.44 --> 00:09:43.44
Truly from the start my parents, Jim and Robin taught us to believe

113
00:09:44.44 --> 00:09:46.44
To be to believe in myself

114
00:09:47.44 --> 00:09:50.44
Of course they protected me and worried about me at times, but they also made me believe that anything was possible

115
00:09:51.44 --> 00:09:55.44
They both grown up in wonderfully stable in loving homes that had also been a little bit sheltered

116
00:09:56.44 --> 00:10:04.44
My mom had said a goal to make sure her kids expanded their horizons. My dad said my dad made sure he didn't just spend time with his kids

117
00:10:04.44 --> 00:10:09.44
But made quality time with them, engaging with us in meaningful and deeply personal ways

118
00:10:10.44 --> 00:10:14.44
Both of them hit their parenting goals squarely on the head

119
00:10:15.44 --> 00:10:19.44
So that sounds like you had a very ideal upbringing

120
00:10:21.44 --> 00:10:26.44
I did and it absolutely gave me the foundation that I needed

121
00:10:28.44 --> 00:10:32.44
To become the person that I wanted and needed to be

122
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:42.44
And also I believe played a huge part in that foundation that allowed me to be the marine and the friend that I needed to

123
00:10:43.44 --> 00:10:48.44
And I'm so thankful and proud that I was in that moment and stepped up

124
00:10:50.44 --> 00:10:55.44
When I was needed, but you know talking about that chapter of the book

125
00:10:55.44 --> 00:11:04.44
I was hesitant actually to write so much about my parents how amazing they are and how much they did for me

126
00:11:05.44 --> 00:11:07.44
Because I wrote this book to

127
00:11:10.44 --> 00:11:13.44
Transcend all boundaries and I

128
00:11:14.44 --> 00:11:15.44
Wanted

129
00:11:16.44 --> 00:11:20.44
Thright of book that anyone and everyone could pick up and understand

130
00:11:20.44 --> 00:11:25.44
But also take lessons from but with that said I didn't want to shut anyone out either

131
00:11:26.44 --> 00:11:28.44
And I know that

132
00:11:29.44 --> 00:11:33.44
There are so many out there that we're not as fortunate as me

133
00:11:34.44 --> 00:11:39.44
That we're not born into that stable loving kind of textbook perfect home

134
00:11:40.44 --> 00:11:44.44
But as I thought about it and through the two years of writing

135
00:11:44.44 --> 00:11:50.44
I decided that hopefully I'm going to put it in there and hopefully

136
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:54.44
It won't turn anyone away if anything

137
00:11:55.44 --> 00:11:57.44
Those that maybe didn't get that example

138
00:11:58.44 --> 00:12:02.44
That don't know not only how great of a parent you can be

139
00:12:03.44 --> 00:12:05.44
But also when those trials and tribulations come

140
00:12:06.44 --> 00:12:11.44
What you can make it through you know obviously everyone loves their kids wants to help them

141
00:12:11.44 --> 00:12:14.44
And make them great but

142
00:12:17.44 --> 00:12:21.44
I wanted to use my parents as an example

143
00:12:22.44 --> 00:12:27.44
Of the hardships that you can make it through with your child and what you can battle through together

144
00:12:28.44 --> 00:12:33.44
You know what else is it's interesting when you come at it from that angle because as I was reading this

145
00:12:33.44 --> 00:12:42.44
The thought goes into your brain right of like well oh he had this perfect childhood right no wonder he ended up good

146
00:12:43.44 --> 00:12:45.44
Here's the thing there's

147
00:12:46.44 --> 00:12:52.44
Kid after kid after kid in the world that have the most perfect situation that they grow up in

148
00:12:53.44 --> 00:12:54.44
And it turns out to backfire on him

149
00:12:55.44 --> 00:12:58.44
I mean what's the difference the line between being a spoiled kid

150
00:12:59.44 --> 00:13:00.44
I mean the fact that you joined the Marine Corps right

151
00:13:00.44 --> 00:13:07.44
You had a nice up bringing you had no reason to say oh I'm not I'm going to leave college

152
00:13:08.44 --> 00:13:10.44
I'm going to go in the Marine Corps I'm going to be a grant the Marine Corps like

153
00:13:11.44 --> 00:13:15.44
That's there's a fine line right with raising kids and I got four kids

154
00:13:16.44 --> 00:13:23.44
There's a fine line between hey I'm supportive and I'm helping and I'm going to and I'm going to be there for them

155
00:13:24.44 --> 00:13:26.44
And turning them into spoiled brats

156
00:13:26.44 --> 00:13:32.44
And it seems like your parents found the place where that line existed and didn't go overboard

157
00:13:33.44 --> 00:13:36.44
But at the same time, you know they they provided you with support

158
00:13:37.44 --> 00:13:38.44
Does that make sense?

159
00:13:39.44 --> 00:13:41.44
Yeah absolutely that makes perfect sense and

160
00:13:42.44 --> 00:13:47.44
Yeah, I think all the way up into working at the chicken plant for two summers

161
00:13:48.44 --> 00:13:52.44
Was about you know where my potentially being spoiled ended

162
00:13:52.44 --> 00:13:58.44
But yeah, you know I'm I could have written the entire book about my parents

163
00:13:59.44 --> 00:14:02.44
I'm so thankful that they've been there from the moment I was born

164
00:14:03.44 --> 00:14:11.44
And from the moment that I woke up again to this beautiful bonus round that I'm living now

165
00:14:14.44 --> 00:14:17.44
Awesome, continue along with the book

166
00:14:17.44 --> 00:14:22.44
I guess we wanted siblings but that proved a particularly elusive goal marked with a lot of loss

167
00:14:23.44 --> 00:14:25.44
The hardest was a stillborn baby boy when I was four

168
00:14:26.44 --> 00:14:28.44
I'd been over the moon about getting a little brother and crushed when it didn't happen

169
00:14:29.44 --> 00:14:31.44
But you can imagine how devastated my parents were

170
00:14:32.44 --> 00:14:38.44
To lose a child and feel completely powerless as it is happening has got to be one of life's greatest agonies

171
00:14:39.44 --> 00:14:43.44
Finally two months after my six birthday my mom gave birth to twin boys

172
00:14:43.44 --> 00:14:51.44
They named Price and Peyton and I was smitten I could not imagine anything in the world more special than getting two siblings

173
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:54.44
It once I could not have been prouder

174
00:14:55.44 --> 00:14:58.44
When I have three older kids and

175
00:14:59.44 --> 00:15:06.44
When they when my youngest was so they were seven like seven nine and eleven or something like that or six eight and ten

176
00:15:06.44 --> 00:15:12.44
And we were we found out that my wife was pregnant we were having another kid and it was Halloween

177
00:15:13.44 --> 00:15:17.44
And we decided we were going to tell them you know Halloween then we can go out trick or treating it be fun

178
00:15:18.44 --> 00:15:22.44
So we set the kids down and we we say we've got some really exciting news for you all

179
00:15:23.44 --> 00:15:27.44
You know you're going to have another baby brother or sister and

180
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:36.44
Their reaction the oldest daughter literally stood up and started crying and ran to a room that made my middle daughter stand up and go to her

181
00:15:37.44 --> 00:15:40.44
I've been my son just started crying right there in the spot

182
00:15:41.44 --> 00:15:43.44
It was like we delivered in the world

183
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:48.44
I was kind of sad well that was exactly what we were looking for what we expected

184
00:15:48.44 --> 00:15:52.44
I was hoping for the Kyle Carpenter reaction like yay this is awesome

185
00:15:52.44 --> 00:15:57.44
But no that whole thing I don't know what it well I still haven't quite figured it out

186
00:15:58.44 --> 00:16:04.44
I don't know if they were jealous. I think they might I think my oldest daughter who is very sensitive about like money

187
00:16:05.44 --> 00:16:08.44
And you know I was in the Navy we didn't have a ton of money. We lived in Southern California

188
00:16:08.44 --> 00:16:11.44
She don't have a Navy's not a lot of money in Southern California. I think she thought to herself

189
00:16:12.44 --> 00:16:14.44
We're not going to be able to afford the eat

190
00:16:15.44 --> 00:16:17.44
She freaked out and they just made the other kids freaked out

191
00:16:17.44 --> 00:16:22.44
But yeah, I also have for a kid that that's a legitimate concern

192
00:16:23.44 --> 00:16:26.44
And I might not be able to relate to that and we'll get to it

193
00:16:27.44 --> 00:16:31.44
But you know after I was injured at Walter Reed especially being a

194
00:16:32.44 --> 00:16:36.44
Junior Marine that I had done one three month appointment

195
00:16:37.44 --> 00:16:40.44
If you want to call it that before I went to Afghanistan and

196
00:16:40.44 --> 00:16:49.44
You know you get these pre-to-pointed breeze but you know at least on the Marine Corps side of things at the time and hopefully this book helps kind of educate

197
00:16:50.44 --> 00:16:51.44
And maybe

198
00:16:52.44 --> 00:16:55.44
Chains things up a little bit as far as protocol goes but

199
00:16:57.44 --> 00:17:02.44
Any in these pre-to-pointed breeze it's kind of like they tell you okay

200
00:17:03.44 --> 00:17:05.44
Well here's what's going to happen if you come back

201
00:17:05.44 --> 00:17:12.44
And thankfully okay with your unit or here's what is going to happen and how it's going to go if you come back in a box

202
00:17:13.44 --> 00:17:15.44
And there's not really that in between so

203
00:17:16.44 --> 00:17:25.44
Being ignorant or military medicine especially that some of who are going to be down the road some of my best doctors that saved my life and my limbs

204
00:17:26.44 --> 00:17:28.44
And kept me here

205
00:17:28.44 --> 00:17:30.44
They were going to be wearing camouflage

206
00:17:31.44 --> 00:17:33.44
Air force army Navy doctors

207
00:17:33.44 --> 00:17:36.44
But to wake up and not know

208
00:17:37.44 --> 00:17:45.44
That military medicine world is out there along with the injuries disorientation and

209
00:17:46.44 --> 00:17:50.44
The medication which probably was the no one factor

210
00:17:51.44 --> 00:17:55.44
I had a extremely hard time trying to come out of

211
00:17:55.44 --> 00:18:02.44
The ICU fog and hallucinations thinking that my parents had lost everything had spent everything

212
00:18:03.44 --> 00:18:07.44
Couldn't provide those meals and food on the table for my brothers

213
00:18:08.44 --> 00:18:12.44
And of course everything thankfully was covered

214
00:18:13.44 --> 00:18:17.44
I think it cost a little a little bit to put a hinty down the back together again

215
00:18:18.44 --> 00:18:21.44
But yeah, you know, I think it as a kid

216
00:18:21.44 --> 00:18:28.44
For some reason you worry about this kind of crazy live situations

217
00:18:28.44 --> 00:18:33.44
But I was thinking that story is going to go a little bit better than it did

218
00:18:34.44 --> 00:18:39.44
And you know what my daughter didn't realize is that an extra pack of ramen noodles didn't cost that

219
00:18:42.44 --> 00:18:46.44
Alright, so getting to you a little bit I was obsessed with any kind of physical challenge

220
00:18:46.44 --> 00:18:49.44
So sports became a major part of my childhood aside from the birth of my brothers

221
00:18:50.44 --> 00:18:53.44
The thing I was most proud of was making the brand in all stars in brand in Mississippi

222
00:18:54.44 --> 00:19:00.44
When I was in first grade it was a coach pitched baseball league and my dad was usually throwing the balls

223
00:19:02.44 --> 00:19:04.44
And then you start getting into football

224
00:19:05.44 --> 00:19:08.44
And I always have to say this so when I'm reading chunks of this book for everyone that's listening

225
00:19:09.44 --> 00:19:11.44
I'm obviously not reading the whole entire book

226
00:19:11.44 --> 00:19:15.44
And there's this is an unbelievable book all kinds of details in there

227
00:19:16.44 --> 00:19:19.44
Great story telling and I don't know how much you thought about that

228
00:19:20.44 --> 00:19:25.44
Kyle as you wrote this but like just your story telling capability it's great. It's great story to read

229
00:19:26.44 --> 00:19:29.44
And so but I'm jumping around as I read this so you know

230
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:33.44
You only get in part of it. That's why you have to buy the book you are worth it

231
00:19:34.44 --> 00:19:37.44
So here we go you're getting your your in a football now

232
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:43.44
Here we go finally as summer practices between my sophomore junior years came to a close obviously I've just jumped jump to head

233
00:19:44.44 --> 00:19:47.44
And the starting lineup was posted on the door the football field house

234
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:52.44
There was my name Kyle Carpenter strong safety and what did you weigh at this point?

235
00:19:54.44 --> 00:20:03.44
Maybe 140 that the most I had done it I had accomplished the thing I had dedicated the last three years of my life to pursuing

236
00:20:03.44 --> 00:20:09.44
I was a lady and I was all it was elating and it was also incredibly deflating

237
00:20:10.44 --> 00:20:15.44
We just learned that my family was moving to South Carolina in a matter of weeks

238
00:20:16.44 --> 00:20:18.44
So your dad worked in the

239
00:20:18.44 --> 00:20:32.44
Poetry industry and just like with a lot of the business world out there you move up do good things get promotions and sometimes that comes with moving around which

240
00:20:33.44 --> 00:20:41.44
Every other time before that kind of moving across the southeast and gradually making it South Carolina

241
00:20:42.44 --> 00:20:46.44
Every other time before that was an adventure

242
00:20:46.44 --> 00:20:48.44
There's always the

243
00:20:49.44 --> 00:21:00.44
I guess nerves and kind of dread of going and walking into that class as the new kid especially in elementary middle school years

244
00:21:01.44 --> 00:21:03.44
But this time just

245
00:21:04.44 --> 00:21:11.44
Not only knowing that I was going to have to restart in a way halfway through high school, but also

246
00:21:11.44 --> 00:21:16.44
I high school football now in the grand scheme of life

247
00:21:17.44 --> 00:21:21.44
Isn't a deal breaker by any means, but at the time

248
00:21:22.44 --> 00:21:27.44
Just having committed and devoted you know every ounce of myself

249
00:21:28.44 --> 00:21:32.44
It was either class or I was working towards that goal as a starter

250
00:21:33.44 --> 00:21:36.44
From eighth grade until tenth grade and the summer after tenth grade

251
00:21:36.44 --> 00:21:43.44
And that was that was hard on me just that in addition to knowing I was going to have to start over

252
00:21:44.44 --> 00:21:49.44
Not only that but the school that I was starting over at was the first two story high school I'd ever seen

253
00:21:50.44 --> 00:21:52.44
I mean they had fake

254
00:21:52.44 --> 00:21:59.44
Fake painted doors on the wall saw that you know dumb freshman would kind of walk towards those and you know it was a massive school

255
00:22:00.44 --> 00:22:03.44
So you know 900 thousand a class so

256
00:22:03.44 --> 00:22:07.44
That was daunting in itself, but you know to have have a move right after

257
00:22:08.44 --> 00:22:11.44
Seeing that strong safety posted on the door or it was tough

258
00:22:12.44 --> 00:22:15.44
Yeah, you kind of went from you also kind of went from

259
00:22:16.44 --> 00:22:21.44
The small the big fish and the small pond or at least a medium sized fish and in a small pond

260
00:22:22.44 --> 00:22:26.44
Into interviewing a tiny fish in a giant pond

261
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:33.44
This is what it felt like here going back to the book the reputation I'd worked so hard to cultivate with my coaches back in Savannah met nothing here

262
00:22:34.44 --> 00:22:39.44
A guy who would always show up ready for practice and give a hundred percent someone who didn't get into fit fights or get put on academic probation

263
00:22:40.44 --> 00:22:46.44
No one knew how hard I worked or how delicate how how dedicated I'd been over the past few years to develop as a leader

264
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:50.44
Basically no one at my new school knew my character. It wasn't anyone's fault

265
00:22:50.44 --> 00:23:00.44
It was just the way the chips fell I was starting from scratch as a guy weighing 135 pounds trying out for football at one of the largest high schools in the state

266
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:05.44
I'm rarely someone who gives up, but at that moment I just couldn't see the point

267
00:23:05.44 --> 00:23:12.44
It wasn't worth it to me to continue making it my life's mission to earn a starting spot on a team where none of the coaches even knew my name

268
00:23:13.44 --> 00:23:17.44
I've always been an optimist, but that doesn't mean you can't be a realist too

269
00:23:17.44 --> 00:23:23.44
Realistically I knew I would graduate before I ever saw the field earlier than the fourth quarter so I quit

270
00:23:24.44 --> 00:23:26.44
And the following months that decision

271
00:23:27.44 --> 00:23:30.44
And the following months following that decision

272
00:23:31.44 --> 00:23:38.44
Remained to this day one of the lowest periods of my life. I hadn't just lost. I had given up the opposite of who I was for the first time in my life

273
00:23:38.44 --> 00:23:40.44
I felt like I didn't have a purpose

274
00:23:40.44 --> 00:23:45.44
Yeah, you know, you said it seems like no big deal, you know high school football or whatever

275
00:23:46.44 --> 00:23:53.44
This is one of the reasons that I've written a bunch of kids books one of the reasons that I wrote a bunch of kids books is because one day I was talking to my kids

276
00:23:54.44 --> 00:24:00.44
One of my kids about something and what I realized, you know, I was like in the military and we had wars going on

277
00:24:01.44 --> 00:24:05.44
And I was worried about you know big things like that life and death and war

278
00:24:05.44 --> 00:24:10.44
And I was talking to one of my kids about something and I forget what it was, but I realized that

279
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:16.44
For a kid like what's going on in their world is the biggest thing in the world

280
00:24:16.44 --> 00:24:21.44
It's the biggest thing in the world and when you're when you work that hard to play high school football and you make the starting team

281
00:24:21.44 --> 00:24:26.44
And now I've said you can't even play anymore that's your whole world that's your whole world

282
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:29.44
And that's the situation you're in and your dad

283
00:24:29.44 --> 00:24:39.44
And notice that and he recognized that there was an opportunity that there was a little one-a private school out in the middle, nowhere

284
00:24:40.44 --> 00:24:46.44
And he asked you if you wanted to go visit it and so you went out and checked out a Y-men King Academy

285
00:24:47.44 --> 00:24:49.44
Tiny K through 12 Christian school

286
00:24:50.44 --> 00:24:54.44
How small, how small was that? Like were we talking to 25 kids in the class?

287
00:24:54.44 --> 00:25:01.44
We're talking three lunch ladies hand-made lunch for every student K through 12

288
00:25:02.44 --> 00:25:11.44
We prepared the football fields, the baseball fields, we painted the lines

289
00:25:12.44 --> 00:25:16.44
We raked the insolent, we built the new football field house

290
00:25:17.44 --> 00:25:23.44
We built the new weight room and did everything but probably because I was a 135 pounds

291
00:25:23.44 --> 00:25:25.44
Bring all the weight down so

292
00:25:25.44 --> 00:25:31.44
But no, it was amazing and just good small town genuine

293
00:25:32.44 --> 00:25:36.44
Patriotic people and

294
00:25:36.44 --> 00:25:38.44
Everyone you know those those

295
00:25:39.44 --> 00:25:46.44
Trupt row and the insolent of the games where the girls would be set up and all the guys with

296
00:25:46.44 --> 00:25:52.44
Camouflage on and still turkey blood all over their pants

297
00:25:53.44 --> 00:25:59.44
We're coming watch the game on Friday night and you know I didn't remember all the time

298
00:26:00.44 --> 00:26:08.44
And you know I've been in big public schools my whole life and you know everything from the uniforms to clear backpacks

299
00:26:09.44 --> 00:26:11.44
So I get to this school and

300
00:26:11.44 --> 00:26:18.44
And I feel like I fit in right away and it was amazing but at the same time

301
00:26:19.44 --> 00:26:25.44
It was a very different world than what I had experienced and what I thought was was normal school

302
00:26:26.44 --> 00:26:28.44
And I remember one time it was

303
00:26:29.44 --> 00:26:32.44
We hadn't even started the day we were kind of in a home room

304
00:26:33.44 --> 00:26:36.44
And this kind of incert comes in

305
00:26:36.44 --> 00:26:41.44
Bigger had been turkey hunting that morning before school

306
00:26:42.44 --> 00:26:50.44
And had a big knife on it and it was just kind of like hey you know you can't have that year

307
00:26:50.44 --> 00:26:54.44
Let's take it back out to your truck like oh, yeah, sorry I forgot I was turkey out in this morning

308
00:26:55.44 --> 00:27:03.44
Now's it time to start the day so it was a different experience but one that I'm forever thankful for

309
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:06.44
At the time you know I was just

310
00:27:11.44 --> 00:27:14.44
I guess you could say in such a bad place

311
00:27:14.44 --> 00:27:17.44
I just thought it was more of a you know why not

312
00:27:18.44 --> 00:27:21.44
Then I want to go check this out and I think it could be good for me

313
00:27:22.44 --> 00:27:24.44
You know but once I did I immediately

314
00:27:25.44 --> 00:27:30.44
felt welcome and loved in that family and from day one I feel like I thrived and

315
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:36.44
Just again met some really amazing people that I still keep in touch with the day and that still

316
00:27:37.44 --> 00:27:45.44
Show me that same amount of love and support as they did on that first day and it's actually not in the book another example of how small it is

317
00:27:47.44 --> 00:27:52.44
You know and through the writing in the contract we had 75,000 words

318
00:27:52.44 --> 00:28:00.44
But as we went along through the two years you know you really dive into deep thought and self-reflection

319
00:28:01.44 --> 00:28:07.44
And then you kind of start branching off remembering different stories and examples in the story you've already given

320
00:28:08.44 --> 00:28:11.44
And we took out the ham sandwich story

321
00:28:12.44 --> 00:28:19.44
But my nickname to these three amazing lunch ladies was ham sandwich because sometimes in the morning

322
00:28:19.44 --> 00:28:23.44
I would sneak in there and the back of the kitchen and make me a couple

323
00:28:24.44 --> 00:28:27.44
But that does anything that's a small one

324
00:28:28.44 --> 00:28:35.44
Oh, God comes ham sandwich again. Do not get breakfast like yeah, so I think so the two hands sandwich is I'll pay you later

325
00:28:36.44 --> 00:28:38.44
But don't let that

326
00:28:38.44 --> 00:28:44.44
Did you did you transfer did you already start at the other big school and go there for a few weeks and then leave?

327
00:28:44.44 --> 00:28:53.44
I did I went the first semester of junior year. Okay, and then I transferred I guess during Christmas break

328
00:28:54.44 --> 00:28:57.44
I spent a year and a half at King but it was a great year and a half

329
00:28:58.44 --> 00:28:59.44
Yeah, that's awesome

330
00:29:00.44 --> 00:29:06.44
So that meant you were going to show up with only one more year to play football as well. Correct. Okay, you got a couple other cool

331
00:29:06.44 --> 00:29:15.44
Things to mention in here you would get guest speakers would come in and you say this one who had their greatest impact me on me was a Vietnam veteran named Cleab

332
00:29:16.44 --> 00:29:18.44
McCleary my saying that right yes

333
00:29:19.44 --> 00:29:23.44
While serving the Marines in 1968, Cleab took heavy shrapnel from a grenade that cost him his left eye

334
00:29:23.44 --> 00:29:34.44
And his left arm at the elbow now he and his wife run a nonprofit focused on helping military families navigate the stresses and challenges of deployment and combat injuries

335
00:29:35.44 --> 00:29:45.44
At the time I wasn't as taking with the fact that he had been a Marine or wounded in battle as I was with the fact that he was someone who really understood how to live

336
00:29:46.44 --> 00:29:51.44
Despite his advancing age and significant injuries he was still active engaged and dynamic

337
00:29:51.44 --> 00:29:56.44
If ever there was someone who had an excuse to throw in the towel it was Cleab but he didn't

338
00:29:57.44 --> 00:30:07.44
I was an off his spirit that that's someone who had been through so much could create an incredible life not only in spite of but because of his experiences

339
00:30:09.44 --> 00:30:15.44
So that's obviously something that stuck with you and then you had a football coach coach do little was a great teacher

340
00:30:15.44 --> 00:30:21.44
And there was really funny with the students but he was also absolutely he would also absolutely destroy you in the past on the practice field

341
00:30:22.44 --> 00:30:28.44
You know how to push you beyond what you thought was possible so that you ended up capable of stuff you never thought you imagined you could do

342
00:30:30.44 --> 00:30:37.44
And here's how you wrapped up I finished the season with over 2,200 yards and offense more than 20 touchdowns and three kickoff returns for touchdowns

343
00:30:38.44 --> 00:30:41.44
It was a different kind of game from playing at a big school but I loved it

344
00:30:41.44 --> 00:30:50.44
In fact the year I was able to play for King Academy my senior year we went to the state championships using losing in the finals in double overtime day

345
00:30:51.44 --> 00:30:54.44
It was a good one. It was a really good one

346
00:30:57.44 --> 00:30:59.44
And

347
00:31:01.44 --> 00:31:06.44
Yeah, I mean I'm just I'm thankful for that experience. I wish I would have had longer

348
00:31:06.44 --> 00:31:15.44
But you know better late than never so it was it was good. Yeah, it's an interesting call decision to leave the big school and go to the little school

349
00:31:16.44 --> 00:31:20.44
That's that's a tough decision for people to make right and

350
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:29.44
You know it's one of those ones while I'm this close to being done forget about it, but you you know you made that tough decision as a kid

351
00:31:29.44 --> 00:31:31.44
That's a tough decision to make it was it was

352
00:31:31.44 --> 00:31:35.44
It was and maybe thankfully at the time I was

353
00:31:36.44 --> 00:31:42.44
So I guess bummed out that it helped me make that decision, but also

354
00:31:43.44 --> 00:31:47.44
You know looking back over my life, especially that time period moving around

355
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:51.44
like

356
00:31:51.44 --> 00:31:53.44
with

357
00:31:53.44 --> 00:31:54.44
all

358
00:31:54.44 --> 00:32:03.44
Great and beautiful lessons in life a lot of times those come from the hardest and darkest of days and so now looking back

359
00:32:04.44 --> 00:32:10.44
And you know my dad has has struggled before and maybe still does a little with the fact that

360
00:32:11.44 --> 00:32:17.44
You know maybe moving me around so much and and you know the fact that I was unhappy during that

361
00:32:17.44 --> 00:32:30.44
Influential time in my life that that kind of led me to join the military

362
00:32:31.44 --> 00:32:36.44
But as I told him and and as I truly feel and believe

363
00:32:38.44 --> 00:32:40.44
That moving around

364
00:32:40.44 --> 00:32:49.44
And and you know being forced to meet new people being forced and new uncomfortable situation circumstances

365
00:32:51.44 --> 00:32:54.44
Now looking back I feel like all of those times

366
00:32:54.44 --> 00:33:07.44
Conditioning maybe isn't the right word but they prepared me for a life of service

367
00:33:08.44 --> 00:33:11.44
For a life of service which

368
00:33:14.44 --> 00:33:17.44
You know really means a life of the unknown

369
00:33:17.44 --> 00:33:26.44
And to join and I don't think until you know you go through the things that you do through your life of service

370
00:33:27.44 --> 00:33:30.44
You can fully comprehend or get mentally prepared or ready for

371
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:33.44
So just to know

372
00:33:34.44 --> 00:33:37.44
Hey, I know what I know I know I am

373
00:33:38.44 --> 00:33:41.44
I might not know it's coming next but I'm going to confidently

374
00:33:42.44 --> 00:33:43.44
Step forward anyway

375
00:33:43.44 --> 00:33:50.44
So I am thankful for all of those moves and and all those good and bad days

376
00:33:51.44 --> 00:33:54.44
Because I do believe it'll it gave me essential tools

377
00:33:55.44 --> 00:33:59.44
To step into that unknown and join the Marine Corps

378
00:34:03.44 --> 00:34:06.44
Yeah, you know going going

379
00:34:07.44 --> 00:34:09.44
Refer back to your parents again here

380
00:34:09.44 --> 00:34:15.44
The example my parents that was instrumental in shaping who I became and how I engaged the world

381
00:34:16.44 --> 00:34:19.44
Everything in our home was about developing character humility and resilience

382
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:23.44
My parents focused on raising my brothers and me to be functional

383
00:34:24.44 --> 00:34:26.44
Rational contributing members of society

384
00:34:27.44 --> 00:34:30.44
Even as they let us enjoy amazing childhoods

385
00:34:31.44 --> 00:34:34.44
They always had an eye on what sort of adults they wanted us to become

386
00:34:34.44 --> 00:34:38.44
Chore charts and church trips were a given

387
00:34:39.44 --> 00:34:44.44
We were expected to take responsible for responsibility for making the house run smoothly

388
00:34:45.44 --> 00:34:47.44
And we were encouraged to be involved with our community

389
00:34:48.44 --> 00:34:49.44
Life was more about

390
00:34:50.44 --> 00:34:53.44
Life was about more than what we could take out of it

391
00:34:54.44 --> 00:34:55.44
It was about making a difference

392
00:34:56.44 --> 00:34:58.44
Not necessarily on some global scale

393
00:34:58.44 --> 00:35:03.44
But by improving someone's day or helping to lift someone up

394
00:35:06.44 --> 00:35:08.44
Those are like the values you were just talking about

395
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:13.44
And then you say this and you kind of talked about this already

396
00:35:14.44 --> 00:35:16.44
But you say I realize there are many people

397
00:35:17.44 --> 00:35:22.44
Out there who weren't as fortunate enough to have the kind of stable loving parents that I was blessed with

398
00:35:22.44 --> 00:35:25.44
Which which is why I don't take my family for granted

399
00:35:25.44 --> 00:35:30.44
There's something to be said for the so called all American childhood

400
00:35:31.44 --> 00:35:35.44
Respect your father, love your mama, stick tight to your brothers

401
00:35:36.44 --> 00:35:39.44
Always do your best, always be honest and never talk back

402
00:35:40.44 --> 00:35:43.44
Like any family ours wasn't perfect

403
00:35:44.44 --> 00:35:48.44
But it absolutely gave me the foundation I needed to become the adult I wanted to be

404
00:35:48.44 --> 00:35:54.44
As the saying goes my parents gave me roots and wings

405
00:35:57.44 --> 00:36:00.44
And none of us had any idea how important both those gifts would prove to be

406
00:36:01.44 --> 00:36:03.44
I'd actually never heard that term before roots and wings

407
00:36:04.44 --> 00:36:06.44
But that's a good one that's a good little dichotomy there

408
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:08.44
You know give them roots and wings

409
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:13.44
The other thing that that is awesome about this

410
00:36:13.44 --> 00:36:17.44
It's kind of like what I was talking about earlier here you are from this

411
00:36:18.44 --> 00:36:22.44
You know, picturesque family of love and support

412
00:36:23.44 --> 00:36:28.44
And yet you still were raised in a way that you were willing to

413
00:36:29.44 --> 00:36:33.44
You know to step up and make us sacrifice and I'm not talking about you know jumping or

414
00:36:33.44 --> 00:36:36.44
I'm just talking about joining the Marine Corps just that right there

415
00:36:37.44 --> 00:36:41.44
You know there's I guess what I'm thinking about is the stereotypical spoiled kid

416
00:36:41.44 --> 00:36:43.44
That's never going to do anything like that

417
00:36:44.44 --> 00:36:48.44
Didn't it doesn't have to be that way right and the other the other thing I like about this is

418
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:54.44
Respect your respect your father love your mama stick tight to your brothers always do your best always be honest never talk back

419
00:36:55.44 --> 00:36:59.44
There's kids that there's kids that look at a kid like that

420
00:37:00.44 --> 00:37:06.44
And they think all that that kids a whip or that kids, you know, what's the word I'm looking for that kids, you know a goody two shoes

421
00:37:06.44 --> 00:37:13.44
Right or a square something like that and what you're proof that

422
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:21.44
That's wrong actually you know that this that you can be raised that way and you can be tough as nails

423
00:37:22.44 --> 00:37:27.44
Because I think the reputation of someone that would say those things

424
00:37:28.44 --> 00:37:33.44
Let me pretty this way I got a 16 year old son he wouldn't say those things because he'd think I don't want my friends to think

425
00:37:33.44 --> 00:37:39.44
I don't want my friends to think I'm you know soft I'm done you know, that's the way it is you know he wouldn't say love your mama

426
00:37:40.44 --> 00:37:41.44
Maybe what a little bit

427
00:37:42.44 --> 00:37:48.44
But you know it kind of sounds like oh this person's just a square a goody two shoes

428
00:37:49.44 --> 00:37:53.44
And it's like oh guess what and you know I I've actually explained this to people before

429
00:37:54.44 --> 00:37:58.44
Because you know in the in the military we get people from every background in life

430
00:37:58.44 --> 00:38:04.44
Every different background in life everything kids from the ghetto kids from the hood kids from the farm

431
00:38:05.44 --> 00:38:11.44
And here's the deal kids from good families kids from no families kids that don't have a family at all

432
00:38:11.44 --> 00:38:19.44
And they all end up in the military and it's you still even with all those diverse backgrounds it's hard to predict

433
00:38:19.44 --> 00:38:28.44
One a person's actually going to be like what what what that person is actually going to be like and you know you meet some kid from the hood

434
00:38:29.44 --> 00:38:30.44
And

435
00:38:30.44 --> 00:38:38.44
Versus some kid from a farm somewhere versus some kid that went to a private school as whole life and you know had a fantasy about being in the seal team so he enlisted

436
00:38:38.44 --> 00:38:47.44
Even though his dad you know has 10 houses, but that's what he does and you just can't tell what that person's character is going to be like based on how they were raised

437
00:38:47.44 --> 00:38:54.44
That's that's just the way it is. I don't know if you notice that but absolutely absolutely from every background

438
00:38:55.44 --> 00:38:57.44
And you get you might have a rich kid that's a total

439
00:38:58.44 --> 00:39:05.44
Loser in your team or you might have a rich kid that's great. I had a guy who was

440
00:39:06.44 --> 00:39:13.44
He was wealthy beyond wealthy right you like you he had more money his family had more money then you

441
00:39:13.44 --> 00:39:20.44
Oh, then a family could ever need in 20 generations like we're talking generational wealth

442
00:39:21.44 --> 00:39:23.44
And I didn't know it

443
00:39:23.44 --> 00:39:28.44
He was he was in there. He's a heart somebody asked me about him. They said, what do you think of this guy and I said, oh, he's he's great

444
00:39:29.44 --> 00:39:33.44
He's you know, it's hard workers great new guys putting out he's making stuff happen and they wasn't it weird

445
00:39:34.44 --> 00:39:38.44
And I was like isn't what weird and they said isn't it just so weird that he's like that and I said

446
00:39:38.44 --> 00:39:44.44
That he's like what why is it weird and they said well you know what his last name is right and I said yeah

447
00:39:45.44 --> 00:39:51.44
But I didn't connect the last name with the last name and it turns out. Yeah, they said this guy he he's got

448
00:39:52.44 --> 00:39:58.44
Unlimited money basically and I never would have known it a million years because he was just a hard work and head down guy that

449
00:39:59.44 --> 00:40:05.44
Was just had enlisted in the dang seal teams. That's awesome and you would never know that so

450
00:40:05.44 --> 00:40:14.44
That's what I think this this calls out to me, you know, is that this type of attitude that gets frowned upon

451
00:40:15.44 --> 00:40:19.44
And I guess that's a little bit of what you know when you were saying you didn't even know if you were to write about this stuff

452
00:40:20.44 --> 00:40:27.44
That's what I'm getting at like you say and I don't know if I'm right about this because it's a little bit but some people might you know not connect with it

453
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:29.44
It's like hey, it's okay

454
00:40:29.44 --> 00:40:38.44
You should connect with it. You can you should what people should do is look at the positive look at the positive things behind this, you know, that's what I think

455
00:40:39.44 --> 00:40:48.44
And I think it's awesome that you did write about it and what did you say here you actually you you said that there's something to be said for it right cool

456
00:40:49.44 --> 00:40:50.44
Great

457
00:40:50.44 --> 00:41:01.44
That's amazing that you took that from it and I appreciate you telling me this because and I've never talked about this before but I always

458
00:41:02.44 --> 00:41:07.44
Just to myself and my head battle with the classic

459
00:41:08.44 --> 00:41:16.44
You know, the nice guys finish last argument because for my entire life my mom has always said you know you're

460
00:41:16.44 --> 00:41:23.44
You're your biggest weakness and this was not in a negative way but more just

461
00:41:24.44 --> 00:41:30.44
Just wanting to look out for me, you know being too trusting of people being too nice

462
00:41:31.44 --> 00:41:33.44
And so

463
00:41:34.44 --> 00:41:42.44
You know kind of playing off this you know should I be a little more hardcore a little more aggressive a little more not me

464
00:41:42.44 --> 00:41:49.44
Because you know, I need to be in this world, but you know, I've

465
00:41:50.44 --> 00:41:54.44
I believe learn and realize over time that

466
00:41:55.44 --> 00:41:58.44
And this is just me personally, but

467
00:41:59.44 --> 00:42:01.44
You know, I should I do

468
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:07.44
You know deeply care about people

469
00:42:08.44 --> 00:42:09.44
And

470
00:42:09.44 --> 00:42:11.44
You know, I

471
00:42:12.44 --> 00:42:16.44
I do feel like maybe I'm a little t-nice at times, but

472
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:19.44
You know, for

473
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:27.44
That one time every once in a while that I might get walked all over you know, there's a hundred times that

474
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:30.44
I'm thankful and

475
00:42:33.44 --> 00:42:35.44
And proud of myself for

476
00:42:35.44 --> 00:42:38.44
You know, always you know really

477
00:42:39.44 --> 00:42:40.44
Striving to

478
00:42:41.44 --> 00:42:46.44
Treat every single person no matter what the circumstance with love and respect and now

479
00:42:48.44 --> 00:42:49.44
You know

480
00:42:50.44 --> 00:42:52.44
I'm starting to get a little bit of gray just turn 30

481
00:42:53.44 --> 00:42:55.44
Lookin over this long you know salty life

482
00:42:56.44 --> 00:42:56.44
I

483
00:42:57.44 --> 00:43:02.44
Looking back, you know, I do feel like now I'm finally starting to get to a place where

484
00:43:02.44 --> 00:43:04.44
Looking back, I do realize that

485
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:09.44
It's not a bad thing at all to

486
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:12.44
Be

487
00:43:13.44 --> 00:43:15.44
If you want to say soft or

488
00:43:16.44 --> 00:43:19.44
A square or you know, whatever it is and

489
00:43:20.44 --> 00:43:23.44
When the times as a marine in Afghanistan

490
00:43:25.44 --> 00:43:26.44
When I've

491
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:29.44
Needed to be when I was called upon

492
00:43:29.44 --> 00:43:33.44
When that was appropriate for that situation and that mission

493
00:43:34.44 --> 00:43:36.44
I feel like

494
00:43:37.44 --> 00:43:39.44
Going into a room first with the saw

495
00:43:40.44 --> 00:43:41.44
Kicking in the door

496
00:43:42.44 --> 00:43:44.44
I have a couple of hand grenades on my

497
00:43:45.44 --> 00:43:46.44
On my plate carrier

498
00:43:47.44 --> 00:43:48.44
You know, I

499
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:51.44
That was me at that time, but now

500
00:43:52.44 --> 00:43:57.44
I do feel like I've gotten it as far as I have in life and I've done as well as I have

501
00:43:57.44 --> 00:44:02.44
Obviously with the amazing support team and the people that picked me out when I stumbled

502
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:04.44
You know, but

503
00:44:05.44 --> 00:44:07.44
Aside from that, I do feel like

504
00:44:09.44 --> 00:44:11.44
My softness, I guess

505
00:44:12.44 --> 00:44:13.44
Has

506
00:44:13.44 --> 00:44:16.44
Got me to an incredible place in life

507
00:44:17.44 --> 00:44:18.44
You know, there's a saying

508
00:44:19.44 --> 00:44:21.44
Which I was thinking of as you were talking about that

509
00:44:22.44 --> 00:44:25.44
The saying is and I know you've heard it before because I know I have

510
00:44:25.44 --> 00:44:29.44
The saying is don't mistake kindness for weakness

511
00:44:30.44 --> 00:44:33.44
And if you think about why that saying exists

512
00:44:33.44 --> 00:44:36.44
That saying exists for two reasons

513
00:44:37.44 --> 00:44:41.44
One because people do mistake kindness for weakness

514
00:44:42.44 --> 00:44:44.44
People see someone that's nice and kind and I think

515
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:46.44
All that person's a pushover

516
00:44:47.44 --> 00:44:49.44
So that's one reason that statement exists

517
00:44:50.44 --> 00:44:52.44
The other reason that that statement exists

518
00:44:52.44 --> 00:44:55.44
Is they're saying don't do that because it's a mistake

519
00:44:56.44 --> 00:44:58.44
Because kindness is not weakness

520
00:44:59.44 --> 00:45:01.44
In fact, kindness takes strength

521
00:45:02.44 --> 00:45:05.44
And when you have that person that has that internal

522
00:45:06.44 --> 00:45:07.44
Fertitude

523
00:45:08.44 --> 00:45:10.44
And they have the self assurance that they don't need to

524
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.44
You know, what makes someone walk around with their chest

525
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:15.44
You know, push out, act and like they're tough

526
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:17.44
Most of the time those tough guys are act and like they're tough

527
00:45:18.44 --> 00:45:19.44
Because they're insecure about something

528
00:45:19.44 --> 00:45:21.44
That's what's going on

529
00:45:21.44 --> 00:45:24.44
And so when people actually have

530
00:45:25.44 --> 00:45:27.44
When people are kind, it's because they're secure

531
00:45:27.44 --> 00:45:29.44
I can tell you like I train you jitsu

532
00:45:30.44 --> 00:45:31.44
I'm way nicer

533
00:45:32.44 --> 00:45:33.44
I started training jitsu when I was

534
00:45:34.44 --> 00:45:36.44
I started training was 20 something

535
00:45:37.44 --> 00:45:39.44
I became nicer and nicer and nicer

536
00:45:40.44 --> 00:45:41.44
The more I train jitsu

537
00:45:42.44 --> 00:45:44.44
Because I realized oh yeah, I don't need to act like a puff guy

538
00:45:45.44 --> 00:45:47.44
I don't need to walk around like some intimidating

539
00:45:47.44 --> 00:45:49.44
No, it's like oh I know how to fight

540
00:45:50.44 --> 00:45:51.44
Somebody wants to bother me then I can handle it

541
00:45:52.44 --> 00:45:53.44
But I really don't want to

542
00:45:54.44 --> 00:45:56.44
Because I don't need to right so I think that idea of

543
00:45:57.44 --> 00:45:58.44
Mistaking kindness for weaknesses

544
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:03.44
There's a reason why that term gets said and there's a reason why you best he did that

545
00:46:04.44 --> 00:46:07.44
And the other thing is you know when you just talked about well, I'll say this

546
00:46:08.44 --> 00:46:10.44
Kindness may

547
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:14.44
Have a negative impact in the short term sometimes

548
00:46:14.44 --> 00:46:16.44
I think that's what you're talking about

549
00:46:17.44 --> 00:46:21.44
Oh, oh this person kind of got what they wanted in that immediate short term thing

550
00:46:22.44 --> 00:46:25.44
Somebody, oh here's somebody cut in front of the line

551
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:27.44
And instead of me being like hey

552
00:46:28.44 --> 00:46:30.44
Go to the back line and say you know what I'm not going to say anything

553
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:33.44
It's fine, and you know I think do I self-ful that person's probably going to be somewhere

554
00:46:34.44 --> 00:46:37.44
Who knows what they've got going on in their life whatever they got kids or whatever

555
00:46:38.44 --> 00:46:39.44
So fine

556
00:46:40.44 --> 00:46:42.44
They might win in that situation right there

557
00:46:42.44 --> 00:46:44.44
But over the long term

558
00:46:44.44 --> 00:46:49.44
Being kind of people and helping people out of me and look at the support network that you just talked about

559
00:46:49.44 --> 00:46:51.44
Those people were supporting you

560
00:46:51.44 --> 00:46:56.44
Obviously they're doing it because they're good people but they're also doing it because you're a good person

561
00:46:57.44 --> 00:47:06.44
You know that little extra effort when they say hey this guy's a good human being this guy said, hi me this guy was nice to me this guy didn't flip out when I made a mistake like okay

562
00:47:06.44 --> 00:47:16.44
That long term that kindness is going to win every single time at long term like I said short term there's going to be some some

563
00:47:17.44 --> 00:47:28.44
Jerk that's going to walk around and push around and it's like okay everyone just saw what just happened and when you come back here into the store or into the situation and you want a little extra help from somebody

564
00:47:29.44 --> 00:47:31.44
It's just you're not going to get what you want

565
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:44.44
You know I used to I was the admels aid for a while and I used to have to book us travel. Yeah, no pressure no pressure and just sit just see me back to I

566
00:47:45.44 --> 00:47:50.44
I will not just go plain take it. I'll go back to Iraq and hard beef

567
00:47:51.44 --> 00:47:58.44
But you know he's a great guy a nice guy, but you know you want to take care of the bosses guy that's in charge of all the seals and I want to make his life easy so I would be booking travel

568
00:47:58.44 --> 00:48:02.44
And you know we'd get bad seats like on an aircraft

569
00:48:03.44 --> 00:48:07.44
And I would call up the the dang help desk of

570
00:48:08.44 --> 00:48:18.44
Delta or of America whoever whatever airline and I would spend at least the first like two minutes of saying hey, how you do you know they'd say how can I help you and I'd say oh

571
00:48:18.44 --> 00:48:29.44
How you do and I'm just setting up some travel and I'd make some little small talk and I'd be nice to him and I guarantee you like the chances of success when you were just nice to people just just just be nice to him

572
00:48:29.44 --> 00:48:35.44
And they'd say well, you know for the first response, but I know this is eats all our books. I'm like I'd say you know, ah wow

573
00:48:36.44 --> 00:48:44.44
Is there anything I could do because I got my bottle. I'd usually complain about my boss. That's how it connect with them. I'd say you know my boss is going to

574
00:48:44.44 --> 00:48:49.44
I work for this guy and he's can be a bit harsh which was actually not true. So I'll tell him a little white lie

575
00:48:50.44 --> 00:48:56.44
Yeah, as soon as I was as soon as they related to me as like someone that was just a work and nug like they were

576
00:48:57.44 --> 00:49:03.44
You know what I can get you an upgrade or hey, let me get you a window or whatever and they just take care of me just by being nice you know

577
00:49:04.44 --> 00:49:10.44
Where I was I guarantee you you get on the phone with someone at an airline and you start saying look I booked these sheets two weeks ago

578
00:49:10.44 --> 00:49:16.44
You need to give me the seat I want there's no positive. You're actually doing on the next slide. You're not even on that

579
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:22.44
Not window not out you're on the next one. You're a middle seat 47th row. You're in the car.

580
00:49:25.44 --> 00:49:36.44
But you know that's you're exactly right and I couldn't have said it better and with all that said I always kind of forget like you know the biggest piece of this and you know

581
00:49:36.44 --> 00:49:46.44
After getting hit with a grenade, you know, it's okay people. I think on nice. I feel like hopefully that in a cell gives me a little bit of street cred, you know

582
00:49:49.44 --> 00:49:52.44
Yeah, that gives you some credit. Yes, I

583
00:49:56.44 --> 00:50:03.44
I'm going to hammer on your parents a little bit more. We'll not hammer on them, but bring them up a little bit more. My parents did not believe in shortcuts

584
00:50:03.44 --> 00:50:11.44
And I always claimed I believe the same thing until I was 18. My dad got me a job at the chicken processing plant where he worked

585
00:50:12.44 --> 00:50:16.44
I figured I would get some kind of an airman boy starting the coffee in the mornings

586
00:50:17.44 --> 00:50:21.44
Maybe filling some paperwork or answering phones in the air conditioned office

587
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:24.44
Dad didn't pull any strings though

588
00:50:25.44 --> 00:50:30.44
And I was definitely not the boss's son. I was Kyle the new hire

589
00:50:30.44 --> 00:50:38.44
And you go into that, you know, it's obviously it's it's real hard work real hard work. Very hard work

590
00:50:39.44 --> 00:50:49.44
And this is what you get out of it. This is again looking at life of how what can I learn and you know you were saying earlier that all these different situations that you've been in that's what prepare you for the future

591
00:50:50.44 --> 00:50:57.44
And this is one of them as awful as I thought that job was I developed a whole new appreciation not only for the value, but also the importance of hard work

592
00:50:57.44 --> 00:51:06.44
It was sobering for me to realize first hand how many hard working people do a job that allows us to grab food and a store without giving a second thought to how it got there

593
00:51:07.44 --> 00:51:11.44
So you're you're you're learning about work, you know, this is this is what it is

594
00:51:12.44 --> 00:51:17.44
And also learn to appreciate once again, you know what we talk about being raised in a sheltered situation

595
00:51:18.44 --> 00:51:23.44
You know, that's that's what that is you don't understand what goes into that

596
00:51:23.44 --> 00:51:36.44
Chicken patty that's coming on to your plate at night, you know, we get a factory up in Maine and there's what we make close, you know, and you people don't realize oh somebody somebody made that somebody showed that

597
00:51:37.44 --> 00:51:43.44
You know, many people you know, stitched their fingers and injured themselves just trying to make a pair of jeans or a time away from their family

598
00:51:44.44 --> 00:51:49.44
Exactly, of course it's a job, but still yeah there's there's real sacrifices out there in the world

599
00:51:49.44 --> 00:52:01.44
And it's and that's what America's made of by the way, that's what America is is hard working people that that put chicken patties on your plate and put a pair of jeans in your drawer

600
00:52:02.44 --> 00:52:10.44
And then you also start getting some leadership skills here. I also gained an important and important mentor in my supervisor Rodney Taylor

601
00:52:11.44 --> 00:52:16.44
He was in charge of of sanitation for the plant and a leader like none I had met before

602
00:52:16.44 --> 00:52:24.44
Before he was rough around the edges and authentic he rolled up his sleeves and worked alongside his team whenever an extra set of hands was needed

603
00:52:25.44 --> 00:52:29.44
He wasn't above-grime or hard work since workers at the plant were from various walks of life

604
00:52:30.44 --> 00:52:39.44
He learned to relate to his people in order to be able to communicate effectively with them rather than getting frustrated at the differences in everyone's backgrounds

605
00:52:39.44 --> 00:52:45.44
He believed that his workers would respect him more if he was able to connect with them directly

606
00:52:46.44 --> 00:52:54.44
He also believed that they would do their job their own job more efficiently if they weren't afraid to ask him for clarification

607
00:52:55.44 --> 00:53:01.44
That's a little decentralized command, you know, hey boss why are we doing this can you explain this to me?

608
00:53:01.44 --> 00:53:11.44
Yeah, oh absolutely and by the way I'll communicate to you in a way that's respectful that you'll understand that you can relate to these are these are really good lessons learned from the chicken factory

609
00:53:12.44 --> 00:53:29.44
Yeah, and also two more things he had this guy that worked on your kind of his right hand man and I although I did see him get out get dirty, you know get down on his hands and these work show us how to do certain things and supervise

610
00:53:29.44 --> 00:53:37.44
for every one time he left his office, you know that guy his right hand man came in 15, 20 times a day

611
00:53:38.44 --> 00:53:50.44
And so now after earning that title becoming a marine seeing how the marine core military as as far as effective communication and

612
00:53:50.44 --> 00:54:07.44
delegating I see what was going on there now and also a big portion of the workforce at that chicken factory was from the Hispanic community Mexican Americans and

613
00:54:07.44 --> 00:54:17.44
after he got that position he would bring his workers in while he was working on learning Spanish himself

614
00:54:18.44 --> 00:54:30.44
Bring it a man all day just asking him questions, you know how do you conjugate this how do you say this and he got to where he was completely fluent and he did that now I realize because

615
00:54:30.44 --> 00:54:37.44
he needed the most effective communication he didn't need anything he couldn't afford that anything

616
00:54:38.44 --> 00:54:43.44
Walson translation just because you know and learn a second language and it's no joke

617
00:54:44.44 --> 00:54:51.44
Of course he could have got you know is right hand man and there got you know any number of people out of the plant to help him out with that

618
00:54:51.44 --> 00:55:04.44
But he wanted to do that he wanted to take ownership of that position and those under him and so through that and and just those simple lessons and him telling me

619
00:55:05.44 --> 00:55:16.44
Just stories which now don't seem anywhere near as crazy but stories from his service and many of them were but just

620
00:55:16.44 --> 00:55:21.44
You know things that unless you enter our world

621
00:55:22.44 --> 00:55:33.44
You know on the other side of it are not only powerful but incredible to listen to to think about to try to even not don't think you're

622
00:55:33.44 --> 00:55:45.44
Effectively can but to try to you know visualize or put yourself in those situations like

623
00:55:46.44 --> 00:56:01.44
You know running to your objective what are you talking about right now but just things like that that is leadership along with those stories of

624
00:56:01.44 --> 00:56:10.44
You know perseverance and just aggressiveness and determination all of that and it together made me

625
00:56:11.44 --> 00:56:14.44
Not only realize what a leader could be

626
00:56:15.44 --> 00:56:17.44
But also

627
00:56:19.44 --> 00:56:21.44
You know

628
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:37.44
When a debt seed started that fire and kind of gave me that burning of of knowing that there is more out there and seeing what maybe with hard work and dedication

629
00:56:38.44 --> 00:56:42.44
I could become not his specifically but just how he carried himself

630
00:56:42.44 --> 00:56:54.44
And the way he you know even as sanitation supervisor at a culture processing facility you know that leadership that he brought everyday and

631
00:56:55.44 --> 00:57:03.44
How all of those under him were not only structured but extremely effective and I never

632
00:57:03.44 --> 00:57:12.44
I hung out in office a lot probably because I got so many cool stories but you know I never and maybe they wouldn't have come in and

633
00:57:13.44 --> 00:57:22.44
Repremanded him or talked him about business in front of me anyway, but not always heard about issues with QA with you know

634
00:57:22.44 --> 00:57:35.44
I go down the list of all the pieces that help make this company but it was never hey we need to start from the beginning sanitize the plant again everybody knew what they were doing how to do it

635
00:57:36.44 --> 00:57:41.44
And they knew they worked hard and did it right and had that effective communication

636
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:45.44
That everyone was going to not only complete the mission but

637
00:57:45.44 --> 00:58:00.44
I hope we get out of there at a decent time but were you conscious of these things as it was happening or is this you look back and you go wow I learned this there and I learned this there or at the time were you saying hey this guy is a good leader

638
00:58:00.44 --> 00:58:15.44
Definitely at the time but I think like with most things I realized a lot more now looking back than I did at the time but I knew that

639
00:58:16.44 --> 00:58:18.44
It was

640
00:58:19.44 --> 00:58:21.44
Special and different

641
00:58:22.44 --> 00:58:27.44
And it was unique what I was experiencing and learning at that time

642
00:58:27.44 --> 00:58:34.44
And he was prior military rank or oh damn yeah, okay, so now we start putting the pieces together

643
00:58:35.44 --> 00:58:41.44
And also where the most creative swear I've ever heard comes into play so

644
00:58:43.44 --> 00:58:45.44
Little little shocking dear years

645
00:58:46.44 --> 00:58:52.44
Yeah, my little deviated you know, yeah, that's awesome

646
00:58:52.44 --> 00:58:59.44
So some people can do it pretty well and you can definitely get a good background in creative swearing in the United States Marine Corps

647
00:59:00.44 --> 00:59:07.44
I was impressed yes, you can't he had a PhD I think I'm just you know maybe bachelor's or master's level

648
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:18.44
I never sworn front of my kids but I would take my son to training sites when I was training guys and the teams and platoons and

649
00:59:18.44 --> 00:59:20.44
I think the first time he

650
00:59:21.44 --> 00:59:23.44
Listen to me give a debrief to a seal-potune

651
00:59:24.44 --> 00:59:31.44
His eyes were as big as sauce or plates man because I you know they start running away crying like he's playing when he fell like he's getting the new brother

652
00:59:32.44 --> 00:59:38.44
He thought that was he was like wow that that must have been some serious talk right there

653
00:59:38.44 --> 00:59:44.44
You can see the look on his face. It was pretty funny. Yeah, but just like we were talking about you know, there's a time and place for everything

654
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:47.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah, even my

655
00:59:47.44 --> 00:59:57.44
Platoon commanders are guys at work for me like get they come over to my house and I never swear in my house, you know, not never front swear in front of my kids and and they come over and they'd be like how do you do that?

656
00:59:58.44 --> 01:00:05.44
And I just you know, it's like no, kids wearing front you can't have your kids running on square your kids will imitate you and you can't have that so

657
01:00:06.44 --> 01:00:07.44
So

658
01:00:07.44 --> 01:00:09.44
You start getting

659
01:00:09.44 --> 01:00:15.44
Done with you know high school and you start looking at college and and that's sort of

660
01:00:17.44 --> 01:00:19.44
The expected path but

661
01:00:19.44 --> 01:00:23.44
You're you're seeing your year was what 2007 is that when you graduated?

662
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:26.44
2008

663
01:00:26.44 --> 01:00:32.44
2008 so we're talking the war is on I mean it's on and

664
01:00:32.44 --> 01:00:39.44
And well, you say this and here in the book around the world terrorist activity was increasing

665
01:00:40.44 --> 01:00:51.44
From the London some way bombings in 2005 that killed 52 people and wounded about almost 700 to the Mumbai train bombings in 2006 that killed nearly 200 people and injured more than 800

666
01:00:51.44 --> 01:00:54.44
Every time I turned on the news it seemed like the world was in chaos

667
01:00:54.44 --> 01:01:03.44
War is awful and I believe it should be a last resort but sometimes it can be the only way to restore some kind of order and help those in need

668
01:01:04.44 --> 01:01:11.44
It seemed to me that the United States military had a mission to do exactly that and I fit the bill of someone who could contribute to that effort

669
01:01:12.44 --> 01:01:18.44
Young, healthy, fit, willing to be challenged any eager to be part of something bigger than myself

670
01:01:19.44 --> 01:01:21.44
It was that last part that affected me the most

671
01:01:21.44 --> 01:01:26.44
As I considered what my life might look like if I took a different path

672
01:01:27.44 --> 01:01:32.44
I found myself increasingly disillusioned with the traditional expected path

673
01:01:33.44 --> 01:01:37.44
The more I looked around it colleges the more I detached and began to feel

674
01:01:38.44 --> 01:01:41.44
The more detached I began to feel from the whole experience

675
01:01:42.44 --> 01:01:47.44
I could definitely see the appeal for many people but it wasn't where I felt I needed to be at that point in my life

676
01:01:47.44 --> 01:01:52.44
I turned 19 in October and had been sitting in classrooms my entire life

677
01:01:53.44 --> 01:01:58.44
There were some major events in the course of human history going on in the world at that time

678
01:01:59.44 --> 01:02:01.44
I wanted to get out and do something

679
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:05.44
So you start thinking about it

680
01:02:08.44 --> 01:02:10.44
And you talk about it with your parents

681
01:02:11.44 --> 01:02:15.44
And that, how was that?

682
01:02:15.44 --> 01:02:18.44
Your mom wasn't too stoked on that, why so?

683
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:25.44
That was a difficult to say the least part of my journey

684
01:02:26.44 --> 01:02:39.44
And, you know, to for a couple of months after I had initially kind of broke the news on what I was really thinking about

685
01:02:39.44 --> 01:02:50.44
And considering like you said, we were in a time of two serious conflicts

686
01:02:51.44 --> 01:03:00.44
And who knows where things were going to go from there with all of these terrible and just unreal things happening around the world

687
01:03:00.44 --> 01:03:07.44
And for a couple of months you know, to see my mom in the morning

688
01:03:08.44 --> 01:03:13.44
I dreaded walking into the living room and seeing her eyes red and swollen

689
01:03:14.44 --> 01:03:18.44
And knowing that she had been crying through the night to herself

690
01:03:19.44 --> 01:03:21.44
Because she was so scared and so concerned

691
01:03:22.44 --> 01:03:27.44
For if I was going to do this, you know, at the time I think she was thinking hopefully not

692
01:03:27.44 --> 01:03:37.44
But if I was going to do this, knowing that her son, her oldest son, could be putting her arms away or kill him

693
01:03:39.44 --> 01:03:42.44
But, you know, after a couple of months

694
01:03:45.44 --> 01:03:47.44
I sat them down and

695
01:03:49.44 --> 01:03:54.44
You know, yes, I agreed that one day I was going to get my degree

696
01:03:54.44 --> 01:03:58.44
I was going to go back to school that that was a priority

697
01:03:59.44 --> 01:04:02.44
But that was a priority that I could complete at that moment

698
01:04:03.44 --> 01:04:05.44
Or 30 years down the road

699
01:04:06.44 --> 01:04:10.44
And I know a lot of people say that and then they eventually don't go and just kind of the classic

700
01:04:11.44 --> 01:04:14.44
I'm going to do this and then it doesn't really work out for whatever reason

701
01:04:16.44 --> 01:04:18.44
But that was kind of second day

702
01:04:18.44 --> 01:04:23.44
I sat them down one day and when I told them

703
01:04:24.44 --> 01:04:30.44
And after I obviously took the time to think self-reflect and truly

704
01:04:31.44 --> 01:04:38.44
Decide if this is not only what's right for me but what's meant for me

705
01:04:39.44 --> 01:04:42.44
When I decided that and I sat them down and I told them

706
01:04:42.44 --> 01:04:53.44
This is not just what I want to do with my life but this is what I need to do and I have to do

707
01:04:54.44 --> 01:05:02.44
And not only do I feel called to do this but

708
01:05:03.44 --> 01:05:08.44
No matter what happens, this is my decision

709
01:05:08.44 --> 01:05:14.44
And this is the path that leads for now that that deep down inside

710
01:05:15.44 --> 01:05:17.44
I need for myself

711
01:05:18.44 --> 01:05:22.44
When I told them that they've always loved and supported me but in that moment

712
01:05:23.44 --> 01:05:25.44
As tough as it was

713
01:05:26.44 --> 01:05:30.44
They gave me a hug and from that moment on they were serving with me

714
01:05:31.44 --> 01:05:32.44
And they've always been

715
01:05:33.44 --> 01:05:35.44
Again they've always supported me but

716
01:05:35.44 --> 01:05:37.44
I guess

717
01:05:41.44 --> 01:05:44.44
That moment that conversation and then hearing that I

718
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:47.44
Believe it was my purpose

719
01:05:48.44 --> 01:05:50.44
I think that ended the

720
01:05:51.44 --> 01:05:52.44
Period

721
01:05:53.44 --> 01:05:55.44
And maybe Denial is not the right word but the period of

722
01:05:56.44 --> 01:05:58.44
Oh well maybe he's just thinking this is cool

723
01:05:59.44 --> 01:06:01.44
They just face it

724
01:06:01.44 --> 01:06:06.44
Did your mom or dad have any military experience

725
01:06:07.44 --> 01:06:09.44
Either themselves or with their parents?

726
01:06:10.44 --> 01:06:13.44
No one of my family except for my mom's dad

727
01:06:14.44 --> 01:06:16.44
Unfortunately died when I was very young

728
01:06:17.44 --> 01:06:20.44
So I think I have one picture with him and I definitely don't remember any conversation

729
01:06:21.44 --> 01:06:22.44
Were you a career military guy?

730
01:06:22.44 --> 01:06:27.44
He was a Navy guy

731
01:06:28.44 --> 01:06:30.44
But yeah I think he spent

732
01:06:31.44 --> 01:06:33.44
It wasn't just a four year term

733
01:06:34.44 --> 01:06:35.44
He spent some significant time in

734
01:06:36.44 --> 01:06:37.44
It seems to me like

735
01:06:38.44 --> 01:06:41.44
In many cases it would be harder for parents that don't

736
01:06:42.44 --> 01:06:45.44
Like if your kid joined the military or my kid joined the military

737
01:06:46.44 --> 01:06:47.44
It'd be like okay I noticed doing it

738
01:06:48.44 --> 01:06:50.44
I know it's like you know it's going to happen

739
01:06:50.44 --> 01:06:53.44
The unknown of just thinking

740
01:06:54.44 --> 01:06:55.44
Because what let's face it

741
01:06:56.44 --> 01:06:58.44
What Hollywood can portray the military to be like

742
01:06:59.44 --> 01:07:02.44
Is a lot different from what the military really is

743
01:07:03.44 --> 01:07:05.44
Yeah and not parent friendly most of the time

744
01:07:06.44 --> 01:07:07.44
Yeah absolutely

745
01:07:08.44 --> 01:07:09.44
Even you know some people

746
01:07:10.44 --> 01:07:12.44
They think that you're they think that 20 years

747
01:07:13.44 --> 01:07:15.44
In the military is 20 years in boot camp

748
01:07:15.44 --> 01:07:20.44
This what they think they think it's 20 years of people yelling in screaming at you and it's like no that's 13 weeks

749
01:07:21.44 --> 01:07:23.44
Or whatever it's a very short period of time

750
01:07:24.44 --> 01:07:27.44
And then you become a responsible human being that's doing stuff

751
01:07:28.44 --> 01:07:29.44
And that and also

752
01:07:31.44 --> 01:07:33.44
I mean the chances of going to war

753
01:07:34.44 --> 01:07:36.44
The chances of being on the front lines

754
01:07:37.44 --> 01:07:38.44
The chances of being an actual direct combat

755
01:07:39.44 --> 01:07:40.44
And then the chances of getting

756
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:43.44
Actually hurt wounded or killed

757
01:07:43.44 --> 01:07:45.44
Or are are relatively small

758
01:07:46.44 --> 01:07:48.44
Compared to what it looks like in Hollywood movie

759
01:07:49.44 --> 01:07:52.44
You know in Hollywood movie it's like everyone's going to fight everyone's going to war

760
01:07:53.44 --> 01:07:54.44
Everyone's getting blown up

761
01:07:55.44 --> 01:07:55.44
That's what happens in the movies

762
01:07:56.44 --> 01:07:57.44
It's not like that in the real military

763
01:07:58.44 --> 01:08:01.44
So I've had plenty people ask me about that

764
01:08:02.44 --> 01:08:03.44
And yet

765
01:08:04.44 --> 01:08:05.44
The bottom line is

766
01:08:06.44 --> 01:08:07.44
The other side of the spectrum is people think

767
01:08:08.44 --> 01:08:09.44
Well that will never happen to me but I'll go in

768
01:08:10.44 --> 01:08:10.44
It's like no

769
01:08:10.44 --> 01:08:12.44
It's just what happens

770
01:08:13.44 --> 01:08:15.44
When you do join the military and you put your name on that line

771
01:08:16.44 --> 01:08:19.44
That means you have the possibility of this happening

772
01:08:20.44 --> 01:08:21.44
You know you could be there

773
01:08:22.44 --> 01:08:23.44
You could go to war

774
01:08:24.44 --> 01:08:25.44
You could fight you could get killed

775
01:08:26.44 --> 01:08:27.44
That's what that's in the

776
01:08:28.44 --> 01:08:30.44
That is one of the things that can happen without question

777
01:08:31.44 --> 01:08:33.44
And I feel like if that is a statement that you say

778
01:08:34.44 --> 01:08:35.44
Maybe you're not

779
01:08:35.44 --> 01:08:39.44
At the right place to sign on that dotted line

780
01:08:40.44 --> 01:08:43.44
I've told many young aspiring

781
01:08:44.44 --> 01:08:45.44
Seals

782
01:08:46.44 --> 01:08:46.44
Oh I want to be in the Sealtimes

783
01:08:47.44 --> 01:08:49.44
And you know they'll start asking me questions about

784
01:08:50.44 --> 01:08:52.44
The workouts and that kind of thing

785
01:08:53.44 --> 01:08:55.44
You know enjoying the Sealtimes to work out

786
01:08:56.44 --> 01:08:57.44
You can work out at the gym

787
01:08:58.44 --> 01:08:59.44
You can work out at 24 hour fitness

788
01:09:00.44 --> 01:09:02.44
When you join the Sealtimes

789
01:09:02.44 --> 01:09:05.44
What you're doing the Sealtimes to do is kill people

790
01:09:06.44 --> 01:09:07.44
And then when you're killing people

791
01:09:08.44 --> 01:09:09.44
There's going to be people that are trying to kill you

792
01:09:10.44 --> 01:09:11.44
And by the way sometimes they do

793
01:09:12.44 --> 01:09:14.44
They could kill you, they could kill your friends

794
01:09:15.44 --> 01:09:16.44
And they're not going to care about your six pack

795
01:09:17.44 --> 01:09:18.44
And you're in your workout plan

796
01:09:19.44 --> 01:09:20.44
No

797
01:09:21.44 --> 01:09:22.44
That's amazing that people come to you

798
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:24.44
And you know, aspire

799
01:09:25.44 --> 01:09:28.44
To be something that you've accomplished

800
01:09:28.44 --> 01:09:31.44
But how many times have you heard I want to be a seal?

801
01:09:32.44 --> 01:09:33.44
Yeah, definitely a lot of times

802
01:09:34.44 --> 01:09:36.44
And I was just saying that yesterday

803
01:09:37.44 --> 01:09:40.44
You know the bottom line is most people quit

804
01:09:41.44 --> 01:09:42.44
80% of people quit

805
01:09:43.44 --> 01:09:44.44
And that number really hasn't changed

806
01:09:45.44 --> 01:09:47.44
So it's cool you want to do it

807
01:09:48.44 --> 01:09:50.44
But how bad do you want to do it?

808
01:09:51.44 --> 01:09:52.44
How bad do you want to do it?

809
01:09:53.44 --> 01:09:54.44
Is the question then do you have the intestinal fortitude?

810
01:09:54.44 --> 01:09:57.44
Did you have the right mindset going into it?

811
01:09:58.44 --> 01:09:59.44
And again I don't care where you're from

812
01:10:00.44 --> 01:10:01.44
I don't care what background you're from because I've seen it

813
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:03.44
Every different type of person you can imagine

814
01:10:04.44 --> 01:10:06.44
Make it through training and I've seen every different type of person you can imagine

815
01:10:07.44 --> 01:10:08.44
Quit through the training

816
01:10:09.44 --> 01:10:10.44
Champion wrestlers

817
01:10:11.44 --> 01:10:12.44
Champion athletes, quitting

818
01:10:13.44 --> 01:10:15.44
Ivy League people, quitting

819
01:10:16.44 --> 01:10:16.44
You just don't know

820
01:10:17.44 --> 01:10:19.44
And then you get some kid from a farm

821
01:10:20.44 --> 01:10:21.44
And Iowa

822
01:10:22.44 --> 01:10:22.44
That makes it

823
01:10:22.44 --> 01:10:23.44
Yeah, you know and you're like

824
01:10:23.44 --> 01:10:24.44
Never wanted the class

825
01:10:25.44 --> 01:10:27.44
And the reason I say that surprising isn't because he's farm of farm and Iowa

826
01:10:28.44 --> 01:10:30.44
But if you grow up in a farm and Iowa there's a decent chance you've never seen the ocean before

827
01:10:31.44 --> 01:10:32.44
And here you're going to be a seal

828
01:10:33.44 --> 01:10:34.44
So yeah

829
01:10:35.44 --> 01:10:38.44
It's definitely something to think about

830
01:10:39.44 --> 01:10:41.44
And I guess what I'm saying is from your mom's perspective

831
01:10:42.44 --> 01:10:43.44
There's two wars going on

832
01:10:44.44 --> 01:10:45.44
And you know

833
01:10:46.44 --> 01:10:48.44
Did you tell me you wanted to join the Marine Corps out of the gate?

834
01:10:49.44 --> 01:10:50.44
Did you go straight?

835
01:10:50.44 --> 01:10:53.44
Yeah, unfortunately that probably didn't help

836
01:10:54.44 --> 01:10:55.44
Did you tell me you wanted to be infantry?

837
01:10:56.44 --> 01:10:58.44
I didn't

838
01:10:59.44 --> 01:11:01.44
So I definitely didn't put this in the book

839
01:11:02.44 --> 01:11:04.44
But you know, always try to be open and honest

840
01:11:05.44 --> 01:11:07.44
No matter what the situation and

841
01:11:09.44 --> 01:11:12.44
And kids, I don't recommend lying to your parents

842
01:11:13.44 --> 01:11:17.44
But I just couldn't, I couldn't hit him with two haymakers in a row

843
01:11:17.44 --> 01:11:22.44
So I pulled the I was military police to start out

844
01:11:23.44 --> 01:11:25.44
And then ease them into it after boot camp

845
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:27.44
Not really ease them at all

846
01:11:28.44 --> 01:11:31.44
But you know, they found out after a little bit of time to digest

847
01:11:31.44 --> 01:11:32.44
Just the Marine Corps piece of it

848
01:11:33.44 --> 01:11:36.44
Do you get a choice of an MLS in the Marine Corps now?

849
01:11:37.44 --> 01:11:38.44
I was a kid

850
01:11:38.44 --> 01:11:40.44
You joined the Marine Corps

851
01:11:41.44 --> 01:11:41.44
Really?

852
01:11:41.44 --> 01:11:43.44
Were you joined the Marine Corps

853
01:11:44.44 --> 01:11:46.44
And then you got whatever assignment you were going to get

854
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:48.44
Everything was open contract?

855
01:11:48.44 --> 01:11:51.44
As far as I could tell, again, man

856
01:11:52.44 --> 01:11:54.44
I'm not exactly smart now when I was 18

857
01:11:55.44 --> 01:11:57.44
But you know, I remember talking to Marine Corps recruiter

858
01:11:58.44 --> 01:12:01.44
And it was like, you know, I want to be a machine gunner

859
01:12:02.44 --> 01:12:03.44
You know, you joined the Marine Corps

860
01:12:03.44 --> 01:12:04.44
Everyone was a rifleman in the Marine Corps

861
01:12:05.44 --> 01:12:06.44
Okay, well I want to be a machine gunner

862
01:12:07.44 --> 01:12:08.44
Well you might be, but you know, you need to join the Marine Corps

863
01:12:09.44 --> 01:12:10.44
And I never got an answer that made sense

864
01:12:11.44 --> 01:12:14.44
And the impression I got was you joined the Marine Corps

865
01:12:14.44 --> 01:12:16.44
And then you got assigned whatever you're going to get assigned

866
01:12:17.44 --> 01:12:18.44
I think later on

867
01:12:19.44 --> 01:12:20.44
They started saying, okay, we need to start

868
01:12:21.44 --> 01:12:23.44
Allowing people to have some say over where they end up

869
01:12:24.44 --> 01:12:25.44
But thankfully

870
01:12:26.44 --> 01:12:27.44
Things have changed

871
01:12:27.44 --> 01:12:27.44
Yeah, good

872
01:12:28.44 --> 01:12:30.44
So did you

873
01:12:30.44 --> 01:12:33.44
Did you actually ever have military police as your MLS

874
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:35.44
Or was that just fabricated completely?

875
01:12:36.44 --> 01:12:38.44
And I used the word

876
01:12:39.44 --> 01:12:40.44
Yeah, yeah, no

877
01:12:41.44 --> 01:12:42.44
Definitely not officially, actually

878
01:12:42.44 --> 01:12:44.44
But I did

879
01:12:45.44 --> 01:12:49.44
You know, because nothing is really official until you go and raise your right hand

880
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:51.44
And all the paperwork is official

881
01:12:52.44 --> 01:12:53.44
So it was

882
01:12:54.44 --> 01:12:56.44
What I was going for for a few months

883
01:12:57.44 --> 01:12:59.44
But as I thought about it

884
01:13:00.44 --> 01:13:04.44
You know, if I was going to do this, I was going to fully commit

885
01:13:05.44 --> 01:13:07.44
And I wasn't, you know, the most important thing was

886
01:13:08.44 --> 01:13:10.44
Was earning that title that Eagle Glove and anchor

887
01:13:10.44 --> 01:13:12.44
And becoming a Marine

888
01:13:13.44 --> 01:13:14.44
But

889
01:13:15.44 --> 01:13:18.44
You know, what good is that if I'm not being true to myself

890
01:13:19.44 --> 01:13:22.44
Yeah, you have a section in here on

891
01:13:23.44 --> 01:13:25.44
On being true to yourself

892
01:13:26.44 --> 01:13:27.44
You say in coming months and years

893
01:13:28.44 --> 01:13:32.44
I would learn what an essential part of the Marine Corps leadership is keeping one's word

894
01:13:33.44 --> 01:13:34.44
Your fellow Marines have to be able to trust you completely

895
01:13:35.44 --> 01:13:38.44
And you them, each Marine has to know that everyone else will keep their word

896
01:13:38.44 --> 01:13:40.44
Otherwise you can't stay focused on the right things

897
01:13:41.44 --> 01:13:46.44
Even more basically than that, however, seeing your promises through his reflection of your character and integrity

898
01:13:47.44 --> 01:13:50.44
And an essential part of integrity is respecting yourself

899
01:13:51.44 --> 01:13:54.44
Enough to defend and follow through on your personal convictions

900
01:13:55.44 --> 01:13:58.44
And that's what this was, I mean, this was a personal conviction of yours

901
01:13:59.44 --> 01:14:01.44
That you were going to

902
01:14:02.44 --> 01:14:03.44
Move forward with

903
01:14:04.44 --> 01:14:05.44
So when you enlisted

904
01:14:05.44 --> 01:14:08.44
When you raised your right hand, did you have infantry?

905
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:10.44
O311 infantry?

906
01:14:11.44 --> 01:14:11.44
I did.

907
01:14:12.44 --> 01:14:12.44
Get some.

908
01:14:13.44 --> 01:14:14.44
Yep.

909
01:14:16.44 --> 01:14:19.44
I can never resist getting a little bit of boot camp activity here

910
01:14:20.44 --> 01:14:22.44
Back to the book, as you near the gate of Paris, I won the bus driver

911
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:26.44
Tell you to put your head between your legs then you ride with your head down until the bus stops

912
01:14:27.44 --> 01:14:28.44
And the doors open

913
01:14:28.44 --> 01:14:34.44
They do this so that if you try and run away while at boot camp, you won't know which direction the only exit is

914
01:14:35.44 --> 01:14:37.44
It sounds crazy, but it also makes sense given what's coming next

915
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:42.44
It's got to be a universal feeling for every Marine I've ever talked to anyway

916
01:14:43.44 --> 01:14:49.44
When that jerk door is jerked open on the bus and you step out onto the famous yellow footprints as a new recruit

917
01:14:50.44 --> 01:14:52.44
You are hit with a mixture of thoughts, is it real?

918
01:14:53.44 --> 01:14:53.44
What's going on?

919
01:14:54.44 --> 01:14:55.44
What have I done?

920
01:14:55.44 --> 01:14:58.44
This is the beginning of a four year obligation that I can't get out of

921
01:14:59.44 --> 01:15:02.44
I know I absolutely had those feelings at first

922
01:15:03.44 --> 01:15:06.44
But I also was determined that this was what I was supposed to be doing

923
01:15:07.44 --> 01:15:09.44
So I resolved not to let anything get to me

924
01:15:10.44 --> 01:15:12.44
He's your said than done at Marine Corps boot camp

925
01:15:15.44 --> 01:15:18.44
So there you go, you're getting that, you're getting the classic Marine Corps

926
01:15:18.44 --> 01:15:25.44
How many times did you seem full metal jacket prior to this?

927
01:15:29.44 --> 01:15:31.44
Crazy answer, I had not

928
01:15:32.44 --> 01:15:34.44
Oh my, I know that's crazy

929
01:15:35.44 --> 01:15:37.44
Had you seen maybe camp stuff

930
01:15:38.44 --> 01:15:43.44
Maybe for the best, no I had you ever seen a rated R movie before

931
01:15:43.44 --> 01:15:50.44
I had but you know I think I

932
01:15:51.44 --> 01:16:11.44
It didn't matter to me to do the research because it didn't matter what was going to be put in front of me or what I was going to be put up against or experience

933
01:16:11.44 --> 01:16:18.44
And so my mindset going into boot camp, well you know I joined the military

934
01:16:19.44 --> 01:16:21.44
Like we said to

935
01:16:22.44 --> 01:16:28.44
Commit, devote my life and purpose and now my body to something

936
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:33.44
Greater than myself or anyone individual

937
01:16:34.44 --> 01:16:36.44
I joined the Marine Corps

938
01:16:36.44 --> 01:16:40.44
I've been growing up, I've always welcomed and thrived on that challenge

939
01:16:41.44 --> 01:16:45.44
And so I knew my limits

940
01:16:46.44 --> 01:16:49.44
At that point and up to that point in my life

941
01:16:50.44 --> 01:16:53.44
But I joined the Marine Corps specifically because I wanted something

942
01:16:54.44 --> 01:16:59.44
That not only would push me past those limits that

943
01:17:00.44 --> 01:17:02.44
I knew about myself

944
01:17:02.44 --> 01:17:09.44
But would make me really look deep down inside myself

945
01:17:10.44 --> 01:17:16.44
To discover not only how far I could go and how hard I could push myself

946
01:17:17.44 --> 01:17:20.44
But who I could become and the Marine I could become

947
01:17:21.44 --> 01:17:26.44
And so you know what that said after a little context I didn't do too much research

948
01:17:26.44 --> 01:17:31.44
Yeah, I think I'd seen one or two rated R movies with moms permission

949
01:17:32.44 --> 01:17:35.44
But you know I just thought about it as hey

950
01:17:36.44 --> 01:17:40.44
I don't think any amount of research can prepare me for what I'm about to

951
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:43.44
The endeavor I'm about to take on

952
01:17:44.44 --> 01:17:46.44
And knowing that and

953
01:17:47.44 --> 01:17:51.44
That there was really no point and even trying to know or prepare

954
01:17:52.44 --> 01:17:54.44
My mindset was just

955
01:17:54.44 --> 01:17:56.44
I'm going to do this

956
01:17:57.44 --> 01:17:59.44
I'm going to fully commit

957
01:18:00.44 --> 01:18:02.44
No matter what happens

958
01:18:03.44 --> 01:18:07.44
I made a vow to myself that I would never quit

959
01:18:08.44 --> 01:18:11.44
And you know I

960
01:18:12.44 --> 01:18:15.44
Even though I couldn't prepare a visualized what was coming

961
01:18:16.44 --> 01:18:18.44
I was always thinking to myself

962
01:18:19.44 --> 01:18:21.44
When those moments do come

963
01:18:21.44 --> 01:18:25.44
I never will moments where I want to quit

964
01:18:26.44 --> 01:18:30.44
Or I feel like I'm at those limits that I just I can't get past

965
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:34.44
I just thought okay in those moments

966
01:18:35.44 --> 01:18:38.44
Right now remember remind yourself

967
01:18:39.44 --> 01:18:41.44
How you felt right now before you went in

968
01:18:42.44 --> 01:18:47.44
How special this is to you how how much this means to you

969
01:18:47.44 --> 01:18:52.44
You're purpose of wanting nothing more than to earn that ego-glowman anchor

970
01:18:53.44 --> 01:18:56.44
And you know people probably I will

971
01:18:57.44 --> 01:19:00.44
Why are you having to remind yourself of that you obviously already know that

972
01:19:01.44 --> 01:19:04.44
But as we all know in this room

973
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:07.44
In those moments

974
01:19:08.44 --> 01:19:09.44
Without remembering

975
01:19:10.44 --> 01:19:14.44
Those things and reminding yourself and self reflecting about those things

976
01:19:14.44 --> 01:19:18.44
That's why I think it's easy to

977
01:19:19.44 --> 01:19:23.44
Well not easy but it allows you to hang up that towel or ring the bell

978
01:19:24.44 --> 01:19:25.44
And so

979
01:19:26.44 --> 01:19:30.44
It was not more of specifics that were coming my way

980
01:19:31.44 --> 01:19:32.44
But just thinking about

981
01:19:33.44 --> 01:19:36.44
When those things that I couldn't even imagine at the time

982
01:19:37.44 --> 01:19:38.44
When they do come

983
01:19:39.44 --> 01:19:41.44
How am I going to handle it?

984
01:19:41.44 --> 01:19:43.44
How do I want to handle it?

985
01:19:44.44 --> 01:19:49.44
And how can I learn and become better and try and strive to become the best version of myself?

986
01:19:50.44 --> 01:19:53.44
I'll tell you what

987
01:19:54.44 --> 01:19:55.44
To you what?

988
01:19:56.44 --> 01:20:03.44
I was 18 when I was doing the Navy and you were about 5,000 times more introspective and thoughtful than I ever was

989
01:20:04.44 --> 01:20:06.44
Like I'm sitting here listening to you

990
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:11.44
You just said something like the things that I, how can I imagine the things I can't imagine?

991
01:20:12.44 --> 01:20:13.44
I couldn't even imagine anything

992
01:20:14.44 --> 01:20:16.44
I was just like so dumb

993
01:20:17.44 --> 01:20:19.44
You heard that saying you're going to be stupid you got to be tough

994
01:20:20.44 --> 01:20:21.44
That was written about me

995
01:20:22.44 --> 01:20:23.44
I was like oh I'm going to the seal teams

996
01:20:24.44 --> 01:20:25.44
That's what I'm going to do

997
01:20:26.44 --> 01:20:27.44
What am I going to do to get ready?

998
01:20:27.44 --> 01:20:28.44
I don't know they run

999
01:20:29.44 --> 01:20:31.44
I'm going to run this women I'm going to swim

1000
01:20:31.44 --> 01:20:38.44
What you know what I said so such they say that that party of brain isn't fully developed until you're like 25 maybe years

1001
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:44.44
It was a little bit earlier maybe mine was a little bit later because you were way more introspective than I ever was

1002
01:20:45.44 --> 01:20:47.44
I was like a knuckle dragger

1003
01:20:48.44 --> 01:20:50.44
And even when you said research

1004
01:20:51.44 --> 01:20:53.44
You're like you know I didn't do any research

1005
01:20:54.44 --> 01:20:57.44
I didn't watch full metal jacket to do research

1006
01:20:57.44 --> 01:21:01.44
I don't think I ever researched anything until I was like 30

1007
01:21:02.44 --> 01:21:06.44
You know I just it was a movie and I said all that looks you know this is a cool warm movie

1008
01:21:07.44 --> 01:21:11.44
I watched every warm movie I could possibly watch and then that opening scene of

1009
01:21:12.44 --> 01:21:15.44
The opening scene which is 45 minutes long of full metal jacket

1010
01:21:16.44 --> 01:21:22.44
In my mind it would I would think oh if you saw that you'd know what was coming right you'd know like okay

1011
01:21:23.44 --> 01:21:24.44
These guys are in the yellow and screen this is bubble ball

1012
01:21:24.44 --> 01:21:27.44
And and you just do any of that

1013
01:21:28.44 --> 01:21:34.44
But you had these incredibly introspective thoughts about what could happen if these situations

1014
01:21:35.44 --> 01:21:41.44
I'm like sitting here baffled that I was able to accomplish anything because I never thought through any of it to that level

1015
01:21:42.44 --> 01:21:44.44
That's good man because you know

1016
01:21:45.44 --> 01:21:47.44
Marines aren't known for being

1017
01:21:48.44 --> 01:21:49.44
Very smart

1018
01:21:49.44 --> 01:21:54.44
So thank you so much for taking care of the things you can hold it now somebody put a meme up

1019
01:21:55.44 --> 01:22:01.44
Of it said happy birthday Marine Corps and it had a picture of a 240 golf and then four and it said it had a picture of the 240 golf

1020
01:22:02.44 --> 01:22:06.44
And it said plus and had four crannies and it said you're this many today

1021
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:08.44
I was like yeah, that's that's pretty funny

1022
01:22:09.44 --> 01:22:11.44
Good good room humor

1023
01:22:12.44 --> 01:22:17.44
You got a couple things about about leadership and obviously I talked about leadership all the time

1024
01:22:17.44 --> 01:22:27.44
And you got this in the book like any successful and efficient organization the Marine Corps emphasizes leadership at the foundational level with every Marine train and ready to take over the job

1025
01:22:28.44 --> 01:22:34.44
Above them if the situation calls for it this appealed to me as being a part of the military the discipline that shapes recruits in deleders

1026
01:22:35.44 --> 01:22:39.44
Obviously the way the Marine Corps does it is not the most pleasant approach

1027
01:22:40.44 --> 01:22:44.44
But it has a remarkable success rate that you've talked about this

1028
01:22:44.44 --> 01:22:50.44
I was honored to be named a squad leader early on and hold that position through graduation

1029
01:22:52.44 --> 01:22:57.44
If the DIs decide you have earned the right to stay in that role and you graduate as a squad leader

1030
01:22:57.44 --> 01:23:01.44
You will leave boot camp at the rank of private first class rather than private

1031
01:23:02.44 --> 01:23:05.44
It is an honor, but it does come with its drawbacks

1032
01:23:05.44 --> 01:23:11.44
You help maintain order, but you also have to share the punishment with anyone in your squad who needs to be disciplined

1033
01:23:11.44 --> 01:23:17.44
If one of the your guys is told the S.D. pull up pushups you have to be there doing them right alongside him

1034
01:23:18.44 --> 01:23:26.44
That was one of the best lessons in leadership the Marine Corps taught me a true leader is not someone who keeps themselves separate from the people they lead

1035
01:23:27.44 --> 01:23:30.44
He or she is right in the middle of what the team is going through

1036
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:34.44
Experiencing the lows as well as the highs with everyone else

1037
01:23:34.44 --> 01:23:42.44
And you go on here there were times when I got in trouble for something that one of my squad members had or had not done

1038
01:23:43.44 --> 01:23:45.44
And I had to be willing to accept that

1039
01:23:46.44 --> 01:23:54.44
Ultimately the responsibility for the execution of any order came back to me since I had been trusted with the job of seeing it through

1040
01:23:55.44 --> 01:23:59.44
And you're getting that in Marine Corps boot camp

1041
01:24:00.44 --> 01:24:01.44
That is so legit

1042
01:24:01.44 --> 01:24:13.44
And it's something, you know, obviously I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership, which means that you know when you're in a leadership position you're responsible for everything that happens

1043
01:24:14.44 --> 01:24:19.44
100% and they're teaching you this with simple tool to teach you to call pushups

1044
01:24:22.44 --> 01:24:26.44
You made that connection though

1045
01:24:26.44 --> 01:24:31.44
That's that's what I find pretty amazing about you that you're making these connections

1046
01:24:32.44 --> 01:24:35.44
See for me when I look back at my career

1047
01:24:36.44 --> 01:24:38.44
I see where I learned things

1048
01:24:39.44 --> 01:24:42.44
But I learned them more like a dog learns

1049
01:24:43.44 --> 01:24:52.44
Like I learned like oh you know if I want this to happen I need to do that like I don't you know your dog isn't saying your dog isn't philosophizing about how to get another treat

1050
01:24:52.44 --> 01:24:57.44
Right they're just performing an action because it worked that's kind of how I learned when I look back in my career

1051
01:24:58.44 --> 01:25:01.44
You know I had a bad leader and I see what they did and I say oh that doesn't work good

1052
01:25:02.44 --> 01:25:07.44
I'm not going to do that then I have a good leader and say oh that work good. I'm going to do that kind of like a dog getting trained that's how I felt

1053
01:25:08.44 --> 01:25:11.44
And yet it seems like you were actually connecting

1054
01:25:12.44 --> 01:25:15.44
Legitimate leadership principles even that that young age

1055
01:25:16.44 --> 01:25:20.44
Even when you're in their chicken factory you were making that happen. That's pretty impressive man

1056
01:25:20.44 --> 01:25:27.44
Thanks man. I wish I would have pulled that off. Hey, I'm making like feel like kind of smart right now. I don't know what to think

1057
01:25:29.44 --> 01:25:31.44
Going on here

1058
01:25:32.44 --> 01:25:47.44
By the time we got to the crucible the grueling 54 hour culminating event that caps off your time at boot camp Arpalton was one unit that felt as if we were going to live or die together every obstacle in the crucible is named for a different marine who is awarded the Medal of Honor

1059
01:25:47.44 --> 01:25:57.44
Part of the experience is learning their stories of bravery and loyalty honoring the history of which we are all about to become a part as newly minted marines

1060
01:25:58.44 --> 01:26:07.44
The Marine Corps motto is Semper Fidelas meaning always faithful. I wanted to be a leader who is always faithful to the people with whom I was serving

1061
01:26:09.44 --> 01:26:11.44
I paid special attention to the each

1062
01:26:11.44 --> 01:26:20.44
To the story of each Medal of Honor recipient as the deias recounted them as we move through the crucible. It felt profound sacred and monumental

1063
01:26:21.44 --> 01:26:31.44
I wanted to understand what made a great marine that was also the reason why when it started raining just three hours into my crucible my feet quickly blistered beyond recognition

1064
01:26:32.44 --> 01:26:34.44
I decided to hike the 10 miles back to the barracks anyways

1065
01:26:34.44 --> 01:26:42.44
Because my feet were bleeding so badly I was offered a ride in the medical van at the end of the second day, but I refused to take it

1066
01:26:43.44 --> 01:26:48.44
Why are you hiking on your tiptoes recruit the deias yelled at me, but I was not going to take the easy way out

1067
01:26:49.44 --> 01:26:51.44
I was going to stay with my platoon no matter how much pain I was in

1068
01:26:52.44 --> 01:26:59.44
You end the final hike as the sun is coming up at the parade deck in front of the Ewo Jima Memorial

1069
01:26:59.44 --> 01:27:06.44
It is there that you are handed your Ego Globe anchor insignia or EGA as it is affectionately called

1070
01:27:07.44 --> 01:27:14.44
They place the EGA in your left hand and shake your right at that moment you officially earned the title marine

1071
01:27:18.44 --> 01:27:20.44
I got chills

1072
01:27:21.44 --> 01:27:28.44
That's that's new relatively new that you get your Ego Globe anchor after the crucible in boot camp

1073
01:27:28.44 --> 01:27:30.44
How many weeks in the boot camp is it?

1074
01:27:34.44 --> 01:27:41.44
You're there a total of about 13 and a half weeks and the crucible happens a little less than a week before you leave

1075
01:27:42.44 --> 01:27:45.44
So that's 12 weeks so you're right there right there at the end of it

1076
01:27:47.44 --> 01:27:52.44
Yeah that's that's that's powerful and it actually stepped up a little bit here

1077
01:27:52.44 --> 01:27:55.44
You go to family day you have the graduation ceremony and then this happens

1078
01:27:55.44 --> 01:27:59.44
It was a relief to know that boot camp was over but I broke into a cold sweat when DI

1079
01:28:00.44 --> 01:28:06.44
Dr. Billingsley pulled me aside and asked to talk to me alone for a minute behind the racks in the squad bay

1080
01:28:07.44 --> 01:28:09.44
Carpenter he said where's your EGA?

1081
01:28:10.44 --> 01:28:11.44
I

1082
01:28:11.44 --> 01:28:13.44
Retrieved my EGA from my cover

1083
01:28:14.44 --> 01:28:20.44
And brought it to him he took off his drill instructor hat and his own insignia and said here

1084
01:28:20.44 --> 01:28:26.44
I want you to have this he said he saw something special in me and that he respected my determination to complete the ten mile hike

1085
01:28:27.44 --> 01:28:29.44
Even though I would have been medically excused from doing so

1086
01:28:30.44 --> 01:28:36.44
That was one of the most surprising and impactful moments of my 13 weeks in boot camp. That's pretty crazy

1087
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:43.44
It was and I mean now looking back it's even more crazy because I've never heard of that happening to anyone else

1088
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:50.44
Maybe it hasn't just didn't come up but yeah before we did get behind the racks though

1089
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:53.44
I thought man I almost made it

1090
01:28:54.44 --> 01:28:56.44
Almost got out here a lot

1091
01:28:57.44 --> 01:29:01.44
But yeah was I mean floored blown away and

1092
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:06.44
Maybe in a way a little confused to say the least

1093
01:29:07.44 --> 01:29:11.44
When you talked to him because you talk about you had a little bit of relationship with and after that

1094
01:29:11.44 --> 01:29:15.44
Like did he tell you what was his reason for doing that?

1095
01:29:16.44 --> 01:29:17.44
That's a big deal

1096
01:29:18.44 --> 01:29:20.44
Yeah, especially when he was the one that

1097
01:29:21.44 --> 01:29:23.44
You know you always have those leaders

1098
01:29:24.44 --> 01:29:31.44
Journalist instructors that are extra hard on you and seem to always pick on you pick you out

1099
01:29:32.44 --> 01:29:35.44
And up until that moment

1100
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:43.44
I felt like it was his mission every day waking up even though at the time we didn't even think that that those guys slept

1101
01:29:44.44 --> 01:29:49.44
But his mission waking up every day to destroy recruit car

1102
01:29:50.44 --> 01:29:54.44
And I wholeheartedly believe that and he did a

1103
01:29:56.44 --> 01:29:57.44
Great job at it

1104
01:29:58.44 --> 01:30:00.44
So you know that

1105
01:30:00.44 --> 01:30:02.44
That moment was very powerful

1106
01:30:02.44 --> 01:30:05.44
And it also showed me that

1107
01:30:07.44 --> 01:30:12.44
You know a

1108
01:30:13.44 --> 01:30:19.44
A good and effective leader at times can seem very hard on you

1109
01:30:20.44 --> 01:30:25.44
But you know journalist structure at the time sergeant Luke Billingsley

1110
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:32.44
I realize that

1111
01:30:34.44 --> 01:30:41.44
At least from just what I knew in that moment and the past 13 weeks that

1112
01:30:44.44 --> 01:30:48.44
And again my opinion but the most effective leaders

1113
01:30:49.44 --> 01:30:51.44
Yes are hard on you

1114
01:30:51.44 --> 01:30:55.44
Yes bring the hammer down daily if they need to

1115
01:30:56.44 --> 01:31:00.44
But you know to have that moment and to have leaders that

1116
01:31:01.44 --> 01:31:07.44
Yes they do destroy you all day but at the end of the day they sit you down

1117
01:31:08.44 --> 01:31:10.44
And they

1118
01:31:11.44 --> 01:31:12.44
They

1119
01:31:12.44 --> 01:31:13.44
calmly

1120
01:31:13.44 --> 01:31:14.44
Respectfully

1121
01:31:15.44 --> 01:31:18.44
Effectively and efficiently talk to you

1122
01:31:18.44 --> 01:31:23.44
And tell you hey this is why I destroyed you all day

1123
01:31:24.44 --> 01:31:31.44
And I didn't do it because I don't like you I did it because I do see that potential

1124
01:31:32.44 --> 01:31:39.44
And I am you know I know the risks I'm a sergeant I've been in I know what you could potentially be going into

1125
01:31:40.44 --> 01:31:42.44
And so

1126
01:31:42.44 --> 01:31:49.44
I'm going to give the reasons not only you know why they're so hard on you

1127
01:31:50.44 --> 01:31:55.44
But also to tell you this is why and

1128
01:31:56.44 --> 01:31:59.44
And I do it because

1129
01:32:01.44 --> 01:32:05.44
I care and not only that they give you the tools

1130
01:32:06.44 --> 01:32:07.44
To

1131
01:32:07.44 --> 01:32:12.44
Fix whatever it was that brought that pain and suffering initially

1132
01:32:13.44 --> 01:32:14.44
And

1133
01:32:15.44 --> 01:32:24.44
Not only the tools to fix it but how you can become better and how you can mitigate those mistakes and make them less and less over time

1134
01:32:25.44 --> 01:32:26.44
And so

1135
01:32:27.44 --> 01:32:29.44
Yeah at the time I think

1136
01:32:30.44 --> 01:32:33.44
Probably because out of a nice mix of fear and just

1137
01:32:33.44 --> 01:32:37.44
Being completely dumbfounded that this was happening

1138
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:40.44
I

1139
01:32:41.44 --> 01:32:42.44
You know I was

1140
01:32:43.44 --> 01:32:45.44
Out of loss for words but again

1141
01:32:46.44 --> 01:32:51.44
And now we're great friends I saw a few months ago we had a beer together

1142
01:32:52.44 --> 01:32:53.44
But

1143
01:32:54.44 --> 01:32:58.44
Yeah that was a that was an important lesson that I've always carried with me that

1144
01:32:58.44 --> 01:33:05.44
You know the people that care about you the people that want to make you the best version of yourself

1145
01:33:06.44 --> 01:33:08.44
Not times have to be hard on you

1146
01:33:09.44 --> 01:33:11.44
I was

1147
01:33:12.44 --> 01:33:18.44
So what the last job I had in the seal teams was training the west coast seal teams

1148
01:33:19.44 --> 01:33:22.44
And I'd be put in for two and two these really hard training evolutions

1149
01:33:23.44 --> 01:33:25.44
And I was really harsh

1150
01:33:25.44 --> 01:33:30.44
Deep reefing I mean the training was really hard we set up super hard training and then and then I was

1151
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:38.44
Incredibly harsh in debriefs and I actually have a guy actually two guys that were they used to they were they worked for me

1152
01:33:39.44 --> 01:33:46.44
But they would record the debriefs like I'd be in their debriefing and they would record them and I've heard them and I'm like really harsh

1153
01:33:47.44 --> 01:33:49.44
I mean just

1154
01:33:49.44 --> 01:33:55.44
Plun and just pointing out all these mistakes and just really harsh on guys

1155
01:33:57.44 --> 01:34:06.44
And I realized that there's two things that made me realize it but one of us I worked had a guy on the podcast name

1156
01:34:07.44 --> 01:34:09.44
Jim Mukayama who is a

1157
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:17.44
Army guy and he worked for David Hackworth and anyways he became a general but he was like one of the leadership principles that he talks about

1158
01:34:17.44 --> 01:34:20.44
I was like it is like the most important things that you care about your people

1159
01:34:21.44 --> 01:34:30.44
So I have that in the back of my mind all the time right and it's what you just said like when you know someone cares about you then you're you're willing to listen to what they have to say

1160
01:34:31.44 --> 01:34:41.44
So there's that and then I started us I started thinking of myself you know well I always tell people what you started off saying like hey be nice to people right

1161
01:34:41.44 --> 01:34:47.44
You know you'd be nice, you know how you know when you're communicating someone be nice because that's how you get people to listen to you

1162
01:34:47.44 --> 01:34:52.44
And that's kind of contradictory as thinking of myself that's kind of contradictory the fact that I'm telling people to be nice

1163
01:34:53.44 --> 01:34:59.44
But I know for a fact that I've heard recordings of me being over the top harsh on guys

1164
01:35:01.44 --> 01:35:09.44
And I said to myself how is it that I because I would get feedback for those guys you know either six months later or two years later or five years later or or that day

1165
01:35:09.44 --> 01:35:22.44
They'd be saying they thanks thanks good stuff. I need to work on that and I was thinking myself how how how what am I doing that's a lot what did I do at that time that allowed me to be

1166
01:35:23.44 --> 01:35:28.44
brutally harsh with these debriefs and I realized that

1167
01:35:30.44 --> 01:35:37.44
General Muka Yamma explain it to me. He didn't say it directly to me at the time, but I came to understood it understand it

1168
01:35:37.44 --> 01:35:40.44
What it was when I was putting guys through training

1169
01:35:41.44 --> 01:35:45.44
All those guys knew that more than anything else in the world

1170
01:35:46.44 --> 01:35:53.44
I cared about them and their men and I wanted them to be able to go overseas accomplish a mission and bring their guys home

1171
01:35:53.44 --> 01:35:55.44
And I cared about that more than anything

1172
01:35:57.44 --> 01:35:59.44
And so they knew that they knew that

1173
01:35:59.44 --> 01:36:07.44
I wanted them to bring their guys home. They knew that I didn't bring my guys home and I didn't want them to ever have to feel that

1174
01:36:08.44 --> 01:36:15.44
They knew I cared about and that allowed me to say hey you screwed this up. This is what you need to fix. You need to do this better

1175
01:36:16.44 --> 01:36:19.44
And they accepted it for the same reason that you

1176
01:36:20.44 --> 01:36:22.44
Listen to and learn from

1177
01:36:23.44 --> 01:36:24.44
Billingsley

1178
01:36:25.44 --> 01:36:27.44
This because you knew

1179
01:36:27.44 --> 01:36:30.44
But he cared about you and that's the difference

1180
01:36:31.44 --> 01:36:35.44
In that every time you're not harsh you're not relaying those lessons

1181
01:36:36.44 --> 01:36:40.44
Good could be a potential moment downrange

1182
01:36:41.44 --> 01:36:46.44
Just a couple months later that you know not for y'all

1183
01:36:47.44 --> 01:36:53.44
You know training is obviously longer, but you know in the short term

1184
01:36:53.44 --> 01:36:58.44
For every mistake that you weren't so harsh on him for

1185
01:36:59.44 --> 01:37:02.44
Could be a life altering or life ending

1186
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:06.44
You know, I'm a state that could have been corrected before so

1187
01:37:07.44 --> 01:37:15.44
Yeah, exactly right. Yeah, I remember coming back from Ramadi and I'd be doing urban or urban combat training with guys

1188
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:27.44
And if I saw a guy it didn't happen it happened for probably like six months when I would see like a young new guy seal standing in the middle of the street with no cover

1189
01:37:28.44 --> 01:37:32.44
I would get I would feel sick to my stomach like I just a real like a sickness

1190
01:37:33.44 --> 01:37:37.44
I would come over me because I would think that they're going to get shot, you know, and I'd go for no big

1191
01:37:38.44 --> 01:37:41.44
I need to get some cover. What are you doing standing out? You know, I'd like try and teach them that lesson

1192
01:37:41.44 --> 01:37:47.44
That man if you're in an urban environment or any environment you cannot be standing out in the open you move from cover to cover

1193
01:37:48.44 --> 01:37:52.44
That's what you do don't set up. You're going to get shot and I would I felt the sickness in my stomach

1194
01:37:53.44 --> 01:37:57.44
And it was this it's the same thing that you'd feel you know patrolling in a muddy two like an army guy

1195
01:37:58.44 --> 01:38:00.44
See one of my guys like standing in the open you go

1196
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:06.44
It's like it makes you feel sick because you're waiting for rounds to come out and so yeah that

1197
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:12.44
Absolutely has an impact and you know for our timeline too, you know you get guys that would go through basic seal training

1198
01:38:13.44 --> 01:38:18.44
Go to seal qualification training and deploy it if they got a sign to a team that was on deployment

1199
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:24.44
They'd go on deployment so yeah, like you could have we I had in reminding you had a couple guys show up that we're

1200
01:38:25.44 --> 01:38:29.44
Yep, we be on deployment they'd show up and you know we wouldn't throw them into an assault train or whatever

1201
01:38:29.44 --> 01:38:37.44
But hey they'd be external security and they would we would we'd start to use them we needed bodies we needed we need men so

1202
01:38:38.44 --> 01:38:48.44
Yeah, it can happen. That's wild. Faith from training. Yeah, they're a lotty. Yeah, yeah, that's that's that's that's an interesting way to get broken into the teams

1203
01:38:49.44 --> 01:38:55.44
Yeah, especially because you know we were talking about earlier like the amount of combat that you may or may not see in a career

1204
01:38:55.44 --> 01:39:04.44
You know you if your first deployment is to Ramadi that's gonna be it's gonna be tough and then halfway through it

1205
01:39:05.44 --> 01:39:07.44
Yeah, do you agree with that?

1206
01:39:08.44 --> 01:39:13.44
Obviously they're trained and you ready what we did what we did with them is we didn't have high expectations

1207
01:39:13.44 --> 01:39:20.44
We weren't like okay now you're gonna be the driver of the lead vehicle like no. Yeah, you know we would we would continue to train

1208
01:39:20.44 --> 01:39:27.44
Continue to train while we're there they'd start off doing something really simple and then if they did okay and we continue to work with them

1209
01:39:27.44 --> 01:39:33.44
We'd get them up to speed and eventually they'd be they'd be alright, but you know what's what's what's crazy

1210
01:39:33.44 --> 01:39:39.44
You talk to guys that were in Vietnam guys are in Vietnam. You're you would just get replacements would just come in and

1211
01:39:39.44 --> 01:39:44.44
They would just show up and go and guy would wrote you know be your 365 days up. You're going home

1212
01:39:44.44 --> 01:39:51.44
And here's a new guy to take your place and that's it and there was no continuity wasn't like work up like what we got the luxury of doing

1213
01:39:51.44 --> 01:39:57.44
Work up trained together lived together then deployed together as a unit do our work and then come on together

1214
01:39:57.44 --> 01:40:04.44
So it doesn't they didn't work that way in Vietnam, which undoubtedly is bad. It's undoubtedly bad. You know

1215
01:40:04.44 --> 01:40:11.44
I had Jim Web on here who is the Navy Cross recipient Marine Corps, but you know his story

1216
01:40:11.44 --> 01:40:18.44
He's like goes finishes the Naval Academy goes to the basic school goes to their little short

1217
01:40:18.44 --> 01:40:25.44
Infect condensed infantry course that's like 11 weeks long gets 13 days leave flies to Vietnam

1218
01:40:26.44 --> 01:40:30.44
And then they take him out on a patrol

1219
01:40:30.44 --> 01:40:33.44
They point up to a ridge line and they're like year-pilton is up there go take it over

1220
01:40:34.44 --> 01:40:38.44
And then he walks up there goes hey, I'm here to take over for the Petune Commanders

1221
01:40:38.44 --> 01:40:44.44
Dad welcome aboard this is Sergeant you know Smith and he's been running things and then that night

1222
01:40:44.44 --> 01:40:51.44
They got like into a heavy contact and he was on the radio calling danger close fire support that night

1223
01:40:51.44 --> 01:41:01.44
12 hours, but it's only grand crazy that ain't it crazy does not and that shows you how efficient the Marine Corps is that you could take a guy like that

1224
01:41:01.44 --> 01:41:09.44
And they would actually be up to speed you know that's incredible that's incredible and then I we just had a guy on the podcast that was Army

1225
01:41:09.44 --> 01:41:19.44
Special for Ranger special forces officer and he didn't list it, but he got to Ranger school got to OCS got to special forces school

1226
01:41:19.44 --> 01:41:27.44
And then volunteer to be in Sagan Vietnam and I was I said you know well, you know, was it hard to get selected and he was like

1227
01:41:27.44 --> 01:41:34.44
You know, he goes it was Vietnam, you know, the survival rate of an officer in Vietnam was like nothing

1228
01:41:34.44 --> 01:41:40.44
And he said if you want to volunteer for that they were like oh yeah, come on come on over here. Oh, you want to volunteer for special forces cool

1229
01:41:40.44 --> 01:41:44.44
Come on over oh you want to be Ranger cool that we come on over oh you want to be in Sagan cool no problem

1230
01:41:44.44 --> 01:41:51.44
There was no resistance whatsoever. It was just wide open doors because so many the casually rates were so high

1231
01:41:51.44 --> 01:42:00.44
So yeah, we kind of have a little bit of a luxury nowadays the way that we do it in the Army and everyone does that way now pretty much

1232
01:42:00.44 --> 01:42:05.44
You can you can lose guys sometimes or you can have guys replaced you know in all branches

1233
01:42:05.44 --> 01:42:10.44
I think but you know they're not gonna they're not gonna do what they did during Vietnam again

1234
01:42:10.44 --> 01:42:13.44
I think everyone recognized that was not a good plan. Yeah

1235
01:42:13.44 --> 01:42:25.44
You head off from there you go to school of infantry S.O.I. which is awesome and you describe that here for the next two months life

1236
01:42:25.44 --> 01:42:30.44
Consistive learning how to master various weapon systems that would be vital for our service in Afghanistan

1237
01:42:30.44 --> 01:42:35.44
That and taking progressively longer hikes where we would dig fighting holes and learn how to operate the radio wall out in the middle

1238
01:42:35.44 --> 01:42:46.44
Where in combat survival depends on finding the right place the right right balance between caution and action I think for most of us myself included are wired for caution

1239
01:42:46.44 --> 01:42:49.44
But I knew that in order to be the kind of leader

1240
01:42:49.44 --> 01:42:55.44
I wanted to be one who would protect my guys and do what I could to ensure the success of the mission

1241
01:42:55.44 --> 01:42:59.44
I had to respond automatically when my brain detected danger

1242
01:42:59.44 --> 01:43:06.44
That became one of my main goals at S.O.I. because we all knew that a deployment was coming wherever we got assigned after graduation

1243
01:43:06.44 --> 01:43:12.44
That's what infantry does we fight so this is interesting. I wrote another book called the dichotomy of leadership

1244
01:43:12.44 --> 01:43:16.44
And what you're talking about is exactly what that book is about

1245
01:43:16.44 --> 01:43:24.44
The difference finding the right balance between caution and action if you throw caution the wind you're gonna get everyone killed if you never take action

1246
01:43:24.44 --> 01:43:30.44
You're also not gonna talk comps mission and you're also in my opinion going to have a higher chance of getting everyone killed

1247
01:43:30.44 --> 01:43:35.44
Because in action and standing there while sitting there while the enemy maneuver is not going to turn out good

1248
01:43:35.44 --> 01:43:41.44
So finding that balance and then the other balance that you talk about is protecting your guys

1249
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:46.44
And accomplishing the mission like that's a dichotomy that you have to balance

1250
01:43:46.44 --> 01:43:51.44
So you're right in it right in it you figured that out

1251
01:43:51.44 --> 01:44:00.44
And again, were you thinking about that you were thinking about that as a how old were you 19 19 years old you were thinking about that

1252
01:44:04.44 --> 01:44:08.44
Yeah, yeah, I think

1253
01:44:08.44 --> 01:44:18.44
These lessons are you know little more complex than than what I was thinking about during boot camp

1254
01:44:18.44 --> 01:44:23.44
So I think I realized these even though I did at the time I realized them

1255
01:44:26.44 --> 01:44:29.44
Less than and more later on

1256
01:44:29.44 --> 01:44:35.44
Yeah, the reflection when you look back and for me I've been doing a lot of that you know

1257
01:44:35.44 --> 01:44:40.44
I got this book that I just wrote leadership strategy in tactics and I start off by explaining

1258
01:44:40.44 --> 01:44:47.44
How I transition I don't use these words because I just thought it's today, but how I transition from learning like a dog

1259
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:51.44
Which is you know kind of how it started to saying oh, okay

1260
01:44:51.44 --> 01:44:59.44
This is what's happening. Oh, okay, and for me one of the reasons that I got focused on leadership

1261
01:45:00.44 --> 01:45:05.44
Was because I wasn't that great in anything else. I wasn't that fast. I wasn't that strong. I wasn't that smart

1262
01:45:05.44 --> 01:45:11.44
I wasn't that smart. I wasn't going to win any of the races and so what I could do is like pay attention

1263
01:45:11.44 --> 01:45:16.44
What was happening pay attention how we could work together as a team help the whole team do a good job together

1264
01:45:16.44 --> 01:45:20.44
I could help with that more than I could help as an individual

1265
01:45:20.44 --> 01:45:28.44
Doing the best because I wasn't the best so I kind of naturally focused on leadership because it was the thing that I could do better

1266
01:45:28.44 --> 01:45:34.44
Then I could do the other things so that's what happened with me

1267
01:45:34.44 --> 01:45:37.44
So that's also amazing that

1268
01:45:38.44 --> 01:45:44.44
You were that interest back if knowing like a good leader realizing

1269
01:45:45.44 --> 01:45:50.44
It meeting to yourself, which is sometimes the hardest thing to do your weaknesses and

1270
01:45:51.44 --> 01:45:59.44
To emphasize different areas that you knew could be strengths. I really wish I would have thought about it that way

1271
01:45:59.44 --> 01:46:05.44
The reality was I was like well, I'm not that great at this, but just wanting a dog treat

1272
01:46:06.44 --> 01:46:09.44
And the dog treat for me was

1273
01:46:10.44 --> 01:46:14.44
As we were maneuvering if I took a step back, I could actually tell what we should do

1274
01:46:14.44 --> 01:46:21.44
I could figure out what we should do and as soon as I realized that I was like, oh, I can I can do this. I can I can be a leader

1275
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:25.44
I didn't even think of it in those words, but I thought I like to make the calls, you know, I can make calls

1276
01:46:25.44 --> 01:46:32.44
I even think of that word yet and then luckily, well, you kind of went through a similar experience to me and we'll get to it

1277
01:46:32.44 --> 01:46:39.44
Where you had a bad leader and then you transferred to a good leader or you had a good leader come in and I had that happened to that was another thing that really opened my eyes

1278
01:46:40.44 --> 01:46:45.44
But hey, you finish you want to get back to this you finish the school of infantry when our assignments came down

1279
01:46:45.44 --> 01:46:49.44
I couldn't help but feel like we had lucked out the four guys who room together

1280
01:46:49.44 --> 01:46:52.44
Griffin Scott Mike Jared Lily and I

1281
01:46:52.44 --> 01:46:59.44
had all been assigned to Fox Company second battalion night Marines, aka hell in a helmet

1282
01:46:59.44 --> 01:47:06.44
It had a nice ring to it in fact two nine is a unit that is only activated in times of combat

1283
01:47:07.44 --> 01:47:09.44
And you say here I couldn't have been more excited

1284
01:47:10.44 --> 01:47:17.44
However, this enthusiasm quickly turned into fear when the Marines from Fox Company arrived to pick us up and take us to our new unit

1285
01:47:17.44 --> 01:47:24.44
20 minutes after S.O.I. graduation the guys assigned to two nine were loaded on a bus for the ten mile drive up the road to Camp Lajoon

1286
01:47:24.44 --> 01:47:27.44
I will never forget the first Marine I saw when we arrived

1287
01:47:28.44 --> 01:47:30.44
He had more tattoos than anyone I had ever met before

1288
01:47:30.44 --> 01:47:36.44
I distinctly remember that his right arm was covered with a skeleton wearing a top hat and holding a double barrel shotgun

1289
01:47:36.44 --> 01:47:39.44
That seemed to point right at anyone looking at it

1290
01:47:39.44 --> 01:47:44.44
Yup, that was me staring down the end of that barrel for the next four years of my life

1291
01:47:44.44 --> 01:47:51.44
I opened the door to my new barracks and experienced them one of the most intimidating moments of my Marine Corps career

1292
01:47:51.44 --> 01:47:56.44
The entire platoon of Marines are new family had lined the halls and preparation for the new guys

1293
01:47:56.44 --> 01:48:03.44
They had just got back from deployment to Iraq and seemed like hungry cage dogs waiting to be fed

1294
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:06.44
It felt like we were there next meal

1295
01:48:06.44 --> 01:48:08.44
And we were

1296
01:48:08.44 --> 01:48:12.44
That's classic like that that scene right there is epic

1297
01:48:12.44 --> 01:48:20.44
Those guys just coming back from Iraq and here's the fresh new meats showing up from S.O.I. ready to get some

1298
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:22.44
Hmm

1299
01:48:22.44 --> 01:48:24.44
Yeah

1300
01:48:24.44 --> 01:48:29.44
So not only you know the debt marine with the tattoos

1301
01:48:29.44 --> 01:48:34.44
Have the most and most intimidating tattoos

1302
01:48:34.44 --> 01:48:37.44
But have a more rock and scabby shirts

1303
01:48:37.44 --> 01:48:40.44
Which I didn't even know was allowed at the time

1304
01:48:40.44 --> 01:48:45.44
So I knew things were getting real when those no skimi shirt on under the canmies

1305
01:48:45.44 --> 01:48:51.44
And then yeah, we get to what I hope have been demolished since

1306
01:48:51.44 --> 01:48:56.44
But the barracks at the infamous French Creek on campus, which were

1307
01:48:56.44 --> 01:49:01.44
Not I mean falling apart

1308
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:09.44
Yeah, that's kind of a given but they were some of if not the last barracks that the rooms were

1309
01:49:09.44 --> 01:49:14.44
Internal and in the hallways and not outside to where

1310
01:49:14.44 --> 01:49:20.44
You can hopefully you could escape if someone a responsible someone

1311
01:49:20.44 --> 01:49:24.44
Maybe an officer was walking by they could save you

1312
01:49:24.44 --> 01:49:29.44
If you were getting destroyed but no and

1313
01:49:29.44 --> 01:49:34.44
Maybe not funny is right where but you know we got off the bus and of course we

1314
01:49:34.44 --> 01:49:39.44
We looked like clowns walking around we got our sea bags at our faculty knows what

1315
01:49:39.44 --> 01:49:45.44
They got all this stuff and so we get off the bus and no one's really around

1316
01:49:45.44 --> 01:49:49.44
They got nice we got hit the perfect time

1317
01:49:49.44 --> 01:49:53.44
Maybe they're all just relaxing maybe the child hall

1318
01:49:53.44 --> 01:49:57.44
We're good you know at least got a couple buffer hours to get

1319
01:49:57.44 --> 01:50:03.44
Get checked into our lovely sweets and you know take a breather before the chaos

1320
01:50:03.44 --> 01:50:08.44
Begins and they were there they just were not outside

1321
01:50:08.44 --> 01:50:12.44
They were patiently waiting for that door to open up and

1322
01:50:12.44 --> 01:50:19.44
Yeah, the chaos began right there but again you know as hard as they were on us

1323
01:50:19.44 --> 01:50:28.44
You know they would have us to the clock at night running classes in the hallway

1324
01:50:28.44 --> 01:50:34.44
Taking you know putting turn it gets on and off going through those nine lines

1325
01:50:34.44 --> 01:50:42.44
Learning about everything from air panels to what he was nowhere you are

1326
01:50:42.44 --> 01:50:53.44
To two those nine lines to you know fighting holes and just everything and at first

1327
01:50:53.44 --> 01:51:00.44
There was no love shown so it wasn't that nice balance that we've already talked about but

1328
01:51:00.44 --> 01:51:06.44
As we went through those first few initial months after that first three month

1329
01:51:06.44 --> 01:51:10.44
Deployment and leading up to Afghanistan you started to realize that

1330
01:51:10.44 --> 01:51:16.44
Yes, they were hard on you but the respect slowly started to come

1331
01:51:16.44 --> 01:51:23.44
And not only hopefully it started to come because they saw us working hard and trying to be the best

1332
01:51:23.44 --> 01:51:29.44
Marines we could but also

1333
01:51:29.44 --> 01:51:36.44
Knowing that when we gave our loved ones that last hug or potential last hug and got on those buses

1334
01:51:36.44 --> 01:51:43.44
It was just us and it didn't matter if you were a boot or if you had been in a year or 10 years

1335
01:51:43.44 --> 01:51:51.44
You were going into that unknown together and just because I'm three ranks lower than you

1336
01:51:51.44 --> 01:51:58.44
Doesn't mean that I'm going to try to protect you any less or vice versa

1337
01:51:58.44 --> 01:52:06.44
And so I think you know that mutual respect started to grow thankfully and you know it's a good thing

1338
01:52:06.44 --> 01:52:10.44
Because you know we didn't know what what was in store for us

1339
01:52:10.44 --> 01:52:19.44
Just to have that mutual respect understanding and that efficiency of working together as a team

1340
01:52:19.44 --> 01:52:25.44
It's not only vital and essential but it's comforting

1341
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:29.44
And you when did you get assigned as a saw gunner?

1342
01:52:29.44 --> 01:52:32.44
Was that turning S. O. Y?

1343
01:52:32.44 --> 01:52:35.44
That once you showed up once I showed up

1344
01:52:35.44 --> 01:52:39.44
Yeah, yeah, I still don't understand

1345
01:52:39.44 --> 01:52:41.44
Why

1346
01:52:41.44 --> 01:52:49.44
140s you pound me was given one of the biggest weapons in the Plotein that welcome in the Marine court

1347
01:52:49.44 --> 01:52:52.44
Right on

1348
01:52:52.44 --> 01:52:55.44
Yeah, that's the way it happened sometimes

1349
01:52:55.44 --> 01:53:03.44
So you just mentioned you guys did a little float and while you're out on float you hear Obama is saying like hey

1350
01:53:03.44 --> 01:53:08.44
We're going to step up the game in Afghanistan you guys kind of know what that means

1351
01:53:08.44 --> 01:53:14.44
Since you guys are prepared basically prepared for deployment because you're on a little mini deployment

1352
01:53:14.44 --> 01:53:19.44
So you guys figure if there's troops are going to Afghanistan for this surge thing going on

1353
01:53:19.44 --> 01:53:24.44
It's probably going to be us you say here. I was excited as were most of the Marines

1354
01:53:24.44 --> 01:53:29.44
I knew this was the reason we had joined up after all to be part of a mission bigger than ourselves

1355
01:53:29.44 --> 01:53:32.44
I had found what I was looking for in the Marine court mission and meaning

1356
01:53:32.44 --> 01:53:37.44
We had a clear objective to flush the Taliban out of their helmet province stronghold

1357
01:53:37.44 --> 01:53:43.44
In southern Afghanistan where they were growing never ending fields of poppies

1358
01:53:43.44 --> 01:53:48.44
Regardless of the what inevitable dangers lay ahead

1359
01:53:48.44 --> 01:53:53.44
I was excited to earn my place in the Plotein that motivation drive was quickly overshadowed

1360
01:53:53.44 --> 01:53:59.44
Though when I was assigned to my four member fire team my fire team leader was a disappointment to be charitable

1361
01:53:59.44 --> 01:54:06.44
Everything I had seen experienced and had been taught about effective leadership was suddenly being contradicted

1362
01:54:06.44 --> 01:54:14.44
He yelled without purpose gave little to no useful instruction and was one of the slowest guys in physical training every day

1363
01:54:14.44 --> 01:54:19.44
How could we trust someone to lead like lead us as a four man fire team in combat?

1364
01:54:19.44 --> 01:54:23.44
Someone like that to lead us in a four man fire team in combat

1365
01:54:23.44 --> 01:54:27.44
He didn't seem to care about anything but his next cigarette and getting out of the military

1366
01:54:27.44 --> 01:54:31.44
The days weeks and months dragged on under his command

1367
01:54:31.44 --> 01:54:37.44
So there you go you got a bunch of little statements in there. You know my favorite one out of that is he yelled without purpose

1368
01:54:37.44 --> 01:54:43.44
Because people think that oh well it's a military leader. They're gonna yell and scream. It's just not true

1369
01:54:43.44 --> 01:54:49.44
And I usually bring up the fact that I never yelled in my guys and in fact when I as a leader when I have to yell at someone

1370
01:54:49.44 --> 01:54:56.44
I feel like I failed about 48 times prior to me having to yell if I take us to a situation

1371
01:54:56.44 --> 01:55:03.44
Where I have to yell and the other thing I was talking to a tech company a few days ago

1372
01:55:03.44 --> 01:55:09.44
And when I got done talking one of the guys that was working there. He's a vet and he comes up. He came up to me and he said

1373
01:55:09.44 --> 01:55:12.44
You know because I talked about look, you know you got to explain to people why they got to understand

1374
01:55:12.44 --> 01:55:15.44
You got to let them come up with a plan. They're all these things all these principles

1375
01:55:15.44 --> 01:55:20.44
And one of the things I said was sometimes when people hear me say hey

1376
01:55:20.44 --> 01:55:26.44
Your people should say hey who they should want to know why we're doing something and that scares some bosses

1377
01:55:26.44 --> 01:55:31.44
Because some bosses you know if Kyle comes to me and says hey why are we doing this? I say shut up and do what I told you to do

1378
01:55:31.44 --> 01:55:37.44
And that's just horrible leadership and so I said this and the guy came up with me afterwards and he said yeah

1379
01:55:37.44 --> 01:55:42.44
You know when I was in I had this my my had this first sergeant who I asked to miss it

1380
01:55:42.44 --> 01:55:48.44
Hey why are we doing this mission and he told me you'd be a better soldier if you'd known if you would shut up and do what you're supposed to do

1381
01:55:48.44 --> 01:55:52.44
You were told to do and he said I'm glad that the military

1382
01:55:52.44 --> 01:55:57.44
Doesn't have that attitude anymore because he was in during the 90s and I go I wish I said listen

1383
01:55:57.44 --> 01:55:59.44
I appreciate it

1384
01:55:59.44 --> 01:56:07.44
But that's not the way the military is the military just like the civilian world has varied types of leaders various levels of leadership

1385
01:56:07.44 --> 01:56:16.44
And some of them are good and some are bad. So here you are in the modern Marine Corps and you still have Marines that haven't quite figured out that hey

1386
01:56:16.44 --> 01:56:21.44
You don't you don't yell at your people for no reason you don't want to you want to actually instruct them on how to do things

1387
01:56:21.44 --> 01:56:27.44
You want to make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing and you had a guy here that wasn't under those things

1388
01:56:30.44 --> 01:56:34.44
Yeah, and it wasn't even a

1389
01:56:34.44 --> 01:56:38.44
Disappointment I was just dumbfounded

1390
01:56:40.44 --> 01:56:42.44
to

1391
01:56:42.44 --> 01:56:46.44
And I I realized

1392
01:56:47.44 --> 01:56:52.44
I had obviously been exposed the other Marines in the pool to my Jones structures

1393
01:56:52.44 --> 01:56:56.44
Every Marine I encountered Rodney up until that point

1394
01:56:56.44 --> 01:56:58.44
It was just

1395
01:56:59.44 --> 01:57:01.44
Baffling to me that

1396
01:57:01.44 --> 01:57:10.44
All of these ideals I had learned about heard about seeing firsthand

1397
01:57:12.44 --> 01:57:26.44
All of the characteristics that I aspire to have as a Marine and all of these things I was working so hard and striving for to not only try to learn but really

1398
01:57:26.44 --> 01:57:36.44
Grasp and understand in every way he went completely against all of that and it was it was

1399
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:51.44
It was scary because you know I wasn't in this situation I didn't get put with this leader leader

1400
01:57:51.44 --> 01:58:04.44
Uh as a sergeant as a staff sergeant after a couple of years in I was first couple of months in the fleet and

1401
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:10.44
Not only did I feel like every day he was in charge of me I was

1402
01:58:10.44 --> 01:58:20.44
I was not able to thrive and potentially reach my full potential for that day or continue evolving as a Marine

1403
01:58:21.44 --> 01:58:23.44
But I

1404
01:58:24.44 --> 01:58:34.44
Didn't a few months we're going to be in Afghanistan and you're going to you're going to be in charge of my life and I just destroyed you in PT

1405
01:58:34.44 --> 01:58:42.44
I just I didn't know what to think I didn't know what to do and I just got and I talked about it. I got in the mindset of okay

1406
01:58:43.44 --> 01:58:50.44
He is not going to define who I am the Marine I am what I know what I can learn

1407
01:58:51.44 --> 01:58:54.44
How I can be in Afghanistan how I can step up

1408
01:58:55.44 --> 01:58:57.44
You know really

1409
01:58:57.44 --> 01:59:09.44
It and this was counterintuitive to think well he really doesn't matter in the big picture because you know you're taught that every Marine is so

1410
01:59:10.44 --> 01:59:17.44
Vital and important to the mission and you need every Marine to be efficient and to reach your full potential

1411
01:59:18.44 --> 01:59:21.44
And so it was scary but

1412
01:59:21.44 --> 01:59:37.44
I just decided that I would train learn evolve on my own and I would help the two other guys in the fire team really just won because he had come in after me he was a lower

1413
01:59:38.44 --> 01:59:45.44
We were same rank that he hadn't been in as long as me so even though it's just a few months different you know you got to start somewhere

1414
01:59:45.44 --> 01:59:51.44
Best of Marine Corps so I was two men and room one of them is the senior man. Yeah, yeah exactly and so I knew that

1415
01:59:52.44 --> 01:59:56.44
Nick who eventually was going to be on on top of that roof with me that day

1416
01:59:57.44 --> 02:00:04.44
I knew that I could take care of Nick we could look out for each other we could learn due classes together behind closed doors

1417
02:00:05.44 --> 02:00:07.44
And we'd have to really worry about him but what that said

1418
02:00:07.44 --> 02:00:20.44
And again talking about once you get on that bus there's no rank you know two two a degree everyone is equal and everyone's lies are just as much on the line as as the person to the right and left of you

1419
02:00:21.44 --> 02:00:33.44
But I and and it's kind of sad to say this but I got to where I look forward to getting on that bus and going on that deployment because I thought

1420
02:00:33.44 --> 02:00:35.44
I

1421
02:00:35.44 --> 02:00:45.44
Can tell you what's up and what's on my mind once we get in Afghanistan and once you're in charge of my life, which I'm not really even going to let happen once we get over there

1422
02:00:46.44 --> 02:00:47.44
but

1423
02:00:47.44 --> 02:00:48.44
I

1424
02:00:48.44 --> 02:00:53.44
Can educate you on on the things I've been thinking about these past six or seven months

1425
02:00:53.44 --> 02:00:58.44
And so I look forward to that thankfully as I talk about it didn't come to that and

1426
02:00:58.44 --> 02:01:02.44
He

1427
02:01:02.44 --> 02:01:04.44
He

1428
02:01:04.44 --> 02:01:06.44
He

1429
02:01:06.44 --> 02:01:08.44
He

1430
02:01:08.44 --> 02:01:10.44
He

1431
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:12.44
He

1432
02:01:12.44 --> 02:01:14.44
He

1433
02:01:14.44 --> 02:01:14.44
He

1434
02:01:14.44 --> 02:01:16.44
He

1435
02:01:16.44 --> 02:01:18.44
He

1436
02:01:18.44 --> 02:01:23.44
He did kind of dig his own grave and make a mistake to where he had to leave the Marine Corps which leads into

1437
02:01:23.44 --> 02:01:31.44
Yeah, this is a awesome situation so so well, that's not the awesome part but the fact is you say here

1438
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:37.44
We caught a break the Marine who had fill our old fire team leaders boots would be his opposite in every way

1439
02:01:37.44 --> 02:01:39.44
Is it tearing Heinz?

1440
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:42.44
Is that how you say it far and boy from Iowa?

1441
02:01:42.44 --> 02:01:43.44
There you go

1442
02:01:43.44 --> 02:01:52.44
Tearing Heinz was an eagle scout an exceptional person and an exceptional Marine and exceptional leader and my saving grace

1443
02:01:52.44 --> 02:01:57.44
He was exactly what I had been searching for opening the door to the barracks

1444
02:01:57.44 --> 02:02:06.44
Lands corporal Heinz seemed more like a teacher than a boss leading us with patience, understanding and calmness

1445
02:02:06.44 --> 02:02:10.44
Heinz's style can be summarized in one sentence

1446
02:02:10.44 --> 02:02:12.44
Lead with action

1447
02:02:12.44 --> 02:02:20.44
Any orders or tasks that Heinz gave us he had either already done himself or he was absolutely willing to do alongside us

1448
02:02:20.44 --> 02:02:27.44
He made sure we ate first he was the one to work holidays and take less to take the less desirable posts

1449
02:02:27.44 --> 02:02:33.44
So his junior guys were taken care of in short he earned respect he didn't demand it

1450
02:02:33.44 --> 02:02:37.44
I wanted to follow him until my last breath

1451
02:02:37.44 --> 02:02:45.44
His arrival changed the morale of our entire fire team the bond of trust and commitment we felt towards one another became unbreakable

1452
02:02:45.44 --> 02:02:53.44
As hard as my first experience was I am thankful to have been exposed to poor leadership so early on

1453
02:02:53.44 --> 02:03:00.44
It not only taught me what leadership is not supposed to be like but it also showed me that no matter what is going on around you

1454
02:03:00.44 --> 02:03:06.44
Or who is in charge you can still be your own leader and lead those and the leader to those around you

1455
02:03:06.44 --> 02:03:09.44
I think that experience helped bring the rest of our fire team together

1456
02:03:09.44 --> 02:03:12.44
We were going to need that in the months ahead

1457
02:03:12.44 --> 02:03:25.44
So there you go you this is a great contrast and this is this is what I was saying this similar thing happened to be had a platoon commander that got fired and an incredible leader came into take his place and that was my second platoon

1458
02:03:25.44 --> 02:03:35.44
And so I had just enough experience to like pay attention and this is probably when I started moving more out of dog learning mode into actually paying attention

1459
02:03:35.44 --> 02:03:42.44
But the shock of those two things the contrast is what sort of shocked me into paying attention

1460
02:03:42.44 --> 02:03:49.44
You know I was saying wow this guy was horrible we didn't like and we had a mutiny and got rid of him and then we had a new guy come in who was not a new guy

1461
02:03:49.44 --> 02:03:57.44
But he was a experience guy to replace him and he was just the contrast of those two made me start paying attention a lot

1462
02:03:57.44 --> 02:03:59.44
And as you said you're thankful to have it

1463
02:03:59.44 --> 02:04:09.44
And I'm thankful that happened to me same thing I saw my previous boss that got fired saw what not to do like hey that's bad leadership I'm not going to do that

1464
02:04:09.44 --> 02:04:21.44
And this is another little dichotomy you talk about even from our first day as new recruits on paris island we were simultaneously being trained to be leaders and also respectful of orders

1465
02:04:21.44 --> 02:04:25.44
So that's that's a dichotomy hey we're going to lead but we're also going to respect the orders

1466
02:04:25.44 --> 02:04:32.44
It might sound illogical but it's actually a brilliant way to shape the character and how look of the next generation of Marines

1467
02:04:32.44 --> 02:04:40.44
What I witnessed in the first year of service modeled me for the importance of the balance of confidence and humility

1468
02:04:40.44 --> 02:04:44.44
Initiative and patience action and caution

1469
02:04:44.44 --> 02:04:52.44
So there you go you just named three dichotomies of leadership that everybody has to pay attention to and if you go too far in any of those directions

1470
02:04:52.44 --> 02:04:56.44
In any of those characteristics they'll be bad

1471
02:04:56.44 --> 02:05:06.44
So if you have too much confidence bad too much humility bad too much initiative bad too much patience bad too much action bad too much caution bad you got a balance every single one of those

1472
02:05:06.44 --> 02:05:14.44
And then you say the best leaders aren't the ones who detach themselves from their people or use their authority to avoid responsibility

1473
02:05:14.44 --> 02:05:26.44
The leaders who have the most influence and ultimately earn the loyalty of their team are the ones who invest themselves in their people and who willingly shoulder the responsibility that comes with being in charge

1474
02:05:26.44 --> 02:05:37.44
I learned from watching the Marines more senior to me and from being entrusted with a bit of authority myself a bootcamp that being a part of whatever needs to be done

1475
02:05:37.44 --> 02:05:42.44
No matter how seemingly menial or unpleasant goes a long way towards strengthening the bonds of a group

1476
02:05:42.44 --> 02:05:53.44
When you know the person in front of you during drills is also willing to be in front of you in a firefight or next you scrubbing the squad bay you begin to view the entire mission and you're rolling it differently

1477
02:05:53.44 --> 02:06:01.44
A great leader communicates his or her actions that you are worth their time effort energy and sacrifice

1478
02:06:01.44 --> 02:06:07.44
That's when your people will trust you to lead them anywhere even into the heart of the fight

1479
02:06:07.44 --> 02:06:10.44
And that's exactly where we were headed

1480
02:06:10.44 --> 02:06:21.44
So there you go, I mean these are just again incredibly profound leadership attributes that you're picking up

1481
02:06:21.44 --> 02:06:27.44
And all of these dichotomies, I don't know, I wrote about a cloud I could make you proud, Jock.

1482
02:06:27.44 --> 02:06:40.44
It's funny, you know if I would have stolen the idea and put it in a book for you you'd have another book under your belt already, but yeah and this is it's one of those things that as I was teaching leadership to young seals

1483
02:06:40.44 --> 02:06:46.44
I realized it, you know because I would tell that you got to be aggressive and then they'd be so aggressive that it would be stupid

1484
02:06:46.44 --> 02:06:53.44
And then I'd say well you can't be over aggressive and then I'd say hey you got to take initiative but then they take so much initiative that no one knows what's happening

1485
02:06:53.44 --> 02:07:01.44
You need to still pay attention to what the overall plan is, you know, so that's what I realized and it's true and everything is true and every characteristic

1486
02:07:01.44 --> 02:07:11.44
And you know it's stuff that you picked up on, you know like I always say I didn't invent any of this stuff from a leadership that has been around for since human beings

1487
02:07:11.44 --> 02:07:24.44
It's been trying to surround the damn lion on the plains and kill it, right? Somebody had to take charge of that and so leadership has always been there and even that group of guys trying to kill a lion

1488
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:36.44
If they got overly aggressive, you know too early they're going to get eaten but if they did it right and if they weren't aggressive enough and well then they would never catch that thing so they'd have to find that balance too

1489
02:07:36.44 --> 02:07:42.44
Right, lift to pass on those lessons to us exactly exactly

1490
02:07:42.44 --> 02:07:49.44
You're heading to deployment now in Afghanistan and again you got so much great information in this book

1491
02:07:49.44 --> 02:07:55.44
I'm jumping ahead a little bit you're heading to deployment as the buses pulled out we wave goodbye to our families

1492
02:07:55.44 --> 02:08:01.44
I looked back to my mom. I'd never seen this look on her face before one of pure desperation

1493
02:08:01.44 --> 02:08:10.44
Then we were out of sight. How that hit you? Seeing your mom like ready to break down

1494
02:08:10.44 --> 02:08:24.44
It was it was it was it was it was it was one of those looks where

1495
02:08:24.44 --> 02:08:34.44
Along with the thousand yard stare even though you know looking around there's nothing around you that could help you

1496
02:08:34.44 --> 02:08:47.44
But you just look around because you're at such a loss and and such despair that that you don't even know what to do in your brain

1497
02:08:47.44 --> 02:08:57.44
I think it's struggling to comprehend is this really happening is reality is reality really reality right now

1498
02:08:57.44 --> 02:09:01.44
And so that

1499
02:09:01.44 --> 02:09:10.44
It was devastating but at the same time as I had so many times before I had to remind myself

1500
02:09:10.44 --> 02:09:23.44
This is my purpose this is what I'm doing this is my mission and even though it devastated me

1501
02:09:23.44 --> 02:09:39.44
I tried and this is hard to say but I think I was in a way more successful than not attempting to

1502
02:09:39.44 --> 02:09:45.44
Not let those emotions carry on any further into that bus ride

1503
02:09:45.44 --> 02:10:01.44
I saw it it was so tough I had that moment but I also knew that if you know I didn't snap out of it get immediately fully into mission

1504
02:10:01.44 --> 02:10:19.44
I could get off that bus and give her a hug and see the complete opposite emotions

1505
02:10:19.44 --> 02:10:25.44
And also new looking around on that bus that

1506
02:10:25.44 --> 02:10:36.44
Not only were we all seeing those loved ones left together but also to look around and wonder

1507
02:10:36.44 --> 02:10:44.44
And not just wonder but no hey on this bus ride home there's going to be a lot of empty seats

1508
02:10:44.44 --> 02:10:59.44
And to know that and know that your emotions and your attitude is going to potentially dictate or affect how many of the seats there are on the way back

1509
02:10:59.44 --> 02:11:06.44
It's a heavy dose of a reality check

1510
02:11:06.44 --> 02:11:15.44
There's a line in the book that I didn't read earlier but it's when you're having the discussions with your parents about joining the military

1511
02:11:15.44 --> 02:11:24.44
And like your mom says something along and you've got the quote in there I'm going to butcher it I'm sure but she says something along lines of I spent you know my entire life

1512
02:11:24.44 --> 02:11:30.44
Trying to protect you and keep you safe and set yourself up set you up to live a good life

1513
02:11:30.44 --> 02:11:36.44
And you're about to go do something that takes that entire idea and throws it in the garbage can

1514
02:11:36.44 --> 02:11:41.44
You know like I said I'm wondering it but just that thought that's what a mom does right?

1515
02:11:41.44 --> 02:11:48.44
A mom supposed to take care of her kids and here she is she's done everything and you've said okay thanks for protecting me for 18 years

1516
02:11:48.44 --> 02:11:56.44
And now I'm going to go put everything at risk everything that you've tried to prevent from happening I'm voluntarily running towards it

1517
02:11:56.44 --> 02:12:03.44
You're going to want to civilian aircraft you

1518
02:12:03.44 --> 02:12:06.44
You

1519
02:12:06.44 --> 02:12:10.44
You know you talk a little bit about your attitude going in

1520
02:12:10.44 --> 02:12:17.44
And you know you say this it's not hard to feel invincible first the Marine Corps trains you so well that you know you are part of one of the most elite fighting forces on earth

1521
02:12:17.44 --> 02:12:25.44
It seems impossible that 40 year old Soviet weapons and homemade detonating devices of the Taliban could possibly pose a serious risk

1522
02:12:25.44 --> 02:12:33.44
You're in your late teens or early 20s and the risk rewards center of the brain has not fully developed so the possibility of danger seems

1523
02:12:33.44 --> 02:12:40.44
Thrilling rather than sobering it's hard to think about death when the world seems so full of life possibility and excitement

1524
02:12:40.44 --> 02:12:47.44
You feel invincible because up to this point you've basically have been broken arm from falling out of a tree fort no problem

1525
02:12:47.44 --> 02:12:50.44
The doctors can fix you right up by putting you in a cast for a month

1526
02:12:50.44 --> 02:12:55.44
Conclusion from a bad hit and football concerning but you'll be back in a few weeks

1527
02:12:55.44 --> 02:13:03.44
When that is your frame of reference it's hard to imagine the degree of injury that might be waiting you that might be awaiting you

1528
02:13:03.44 --> 02:13:08.44
If you can imagine it it still seems like something that would happen to someone else

1529
02:13:08.44 --> 02:13:14.44
The problem is that you are everyone else is someone else

1530
02:13:14.44 --> 02:13:26.44
And I don't know if you've had a chance to listen to it, but I just had a guy I'm a marine that was winning the Guadalcanal Taroa side pan in Tinney and

1531
02:13:26.44 --> 02:13:33.44
You know I've had this same exact conversation with a lot of guys that have been in a lot of extreme combat

1532
02:13:33.44 --> 02:13:39.44
But you know he was the same way he's like, yeah, I mean I'm sure some people are going to die, but it's not going to be me

1533
02:13:39.44 --> 02:13:45.44
And by the way he didn't get a gut shot at Taroa a hundred meters out of the landing craft

1534
02:13:45.44 --> 02:13:48.44
Well he's still at 500 meters to get to the beach

1535
02:13:48.44 --> 02:13:53.44
You know talk about miracles he was able to survive, but yeah that attitude of

1536
02:13:53.44 --> 02:14:04.44
It's not going to happen to me is a real prevalent one for anyone under the age of like 23 24 25 27 29

1537
02:14:04.44 --> 02:14:14.44
In some time 40 and yeah that's it and I think a lot of it is attitude and again kind of like I said at the beginning

1538
02:14:14.44 --> 02:14:20.44
You know what even though we signed up for it we raised our right hand

1539
02:14:20.44 --> 02:14:25.44
You can do the research you know we're in a time of two conflicts and two different

1540
02:14:25.44 --> 02:14:29.44
On two different fronts and two different countries and you know

1541
02:14:29.44 --> 02:14:37.44
For y'all's family many more countries and a lot of fronts that thankfully people have the luxury of not even knowing about

1542
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:39.44
But with that said

1543
02:14:43.44 --> 02:14:46.44
Even though we signed up and volunteered

1544
02:14:46.44 --> 02:14:52.44
I had to think, oh well I could get all my lens blown off

1545
02:14:52.44 --> 02:15:01.44
Or second I put boots on the ground, sniper could take me out at 18, 19 years old

1546
02:15:01.44 --> 02:15:08.44
I think those even though you know it's a risk you're not naive about anything

1547
02:15:11.44 --> 02:15:13.44
Those things are just so

1548
02:15:15.44 --> 02:15:17.44
Serial

1549
02:15:17.44 --> 02:15:24.44
I think along with thinking us not going to happen to me also just not really being able to comprehend

1550
02:15:24.44 --> 02:15:30.44
The possibilities that are very quickly and aggressively coming your way

1551
02:15:30.44 --> 02:15:37.44
I think you know those two things is are the two biggest country butters to that mindset

1552
02:15:38.44 --> 02:15:45.44
I guess we should be thankful that that mindset exists because otherwise I think you might go crazy

1553
02:15:45.44 --> 02:15:48.44
Right? Yeah, absolutely

1554
02:15:49.44 --> 02:15:56.44
Alright jump in ahead we didn't jump into patrols on day one so you arrive helmet province autumn 2010

1555
02:15:57.44 --> 02:16:01.44
We didn't jump into patrols on day one there was a kind of leadership training down period

1556
02:16:01.44 --> 02:16:06.44
The higher ranking Marines went out on patrol first to get a feel for things before leading patrols of their own

1557
02:16:06.44 --> 02:16:10.44
It was a way to help everyone get acclimated to being outside the wire

1558
02:16:10.44 --> 02:16:17.44
But our step our time to step into an active role came quickly enough my first patrol took place four or five days after we arrived

1559
02:16:18.44 --> 02:16:23.44
We stopped at a compound at the end of a road after pausing to talk to the owner about his family in the area

1560
02:16:23.44 --> 02:16:27.44
And whether or not he'd seen Taliban nearby

1561
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:32.44
You guys set up security here and as I land my stomach behind my gun scanning the landscape

1562
02:16:32.44 --> 02:16:37.44
I remember thinking that the field before me was a perfect rectangle as if it had been laid out with a ruler

1563
02:16:37.44 --> 02:16:44.44
In a region where there's so much where so much a scatter shot adapted to the land it was unusual to see something so precise

1564
02:16:44.44 --> 02:16:52.44
It was oddly beautiful all of a sudden it was as if the skies had opened and the clouds were dumping hail so many rounds

1565
02:16:52.44 --> 02:16:58.44
We're hitting the ground around me that I couldn't even see through my scope for all the dust they were kicking up

1566
02:16:58.44 --> 02:17:05.44
There was a funk as a bullet ricochet off the side of a shed and at almost exactly the same time

1567
02:17:05.44 --> 02:17:09.44
I felt something hit my lower back about two inches to the right of my spine

1568
02:17:09.44 --> 02:17:16.44
Just above my belt line and below my body armor probably only an inch of skin

1569
02:17:16.44 --> 02:17:22.44
Probably the only inch of skin that wasn't protected. I'm hit I yelled grabbing my gun and leaping about ten feet behind me

1570
02:17:22.44 --> 02:17:26.44
To where my buddies were holding security two thoughts raised through my brain

1571
02:17:26.44 --> 02:17:34.44
Did bullet wounds really not hurt as much as I had imagined or did I just have so much adrenaline in my system that I wasn't registering pain

1572
02:17:34.44 --> 02:17:37.44
And after an hour outside the wire

1573
02:17:37.44 --> 02:17:39.44
Was I already a casualty?

1574
02:17:39.44 --> 02:17:45.44
I was furious that I wouldn't get to contribute anything to the effort and that if this stupid towel band bullet sent me home

1575
02:17:45.44 --> 02:17:51.44
I couldn't imagine leaving my guys behind because of an injury on our very first patrol as I bounced back

1576
02:17:51.44 --> 02:17:56.44
Another marine instantaneously moved forward to man the end of the road security position

1577
02:17:56.44 --> 02:17:59.44
While the corpsman checked me out behind the compound

1578
02:17:59.44 --> 02:18:07.44
Amazingly the bullet had not penetrated the skin, but it did leave a dark bruise almost like a paintball fired at point blank range

1579
02:18:07.44 --> 02:18:12.44
I was hurting but grateful it wasn't a grateful my tour wasn't over so quickly

1580
02:18:12.44 --> 02:18:19.44
So that's your first contact you get that you get the ricochet round day

1581
02:18:19.44 --> 02:18:23.44
Let's just say

1582
02:18:23.44 --> 02:18:30.44
For the next four months every single day that we were getting some

1583
02:18:30.44 --> 02:18:36.44
That is the one and only and last time I ever was in the prone position

1584
02:18:36.44 --> 02:18:46.44
All 800 rounds every single day out of my soul roughly everything was just standing from that point on

1585
02:18:46.44 --> 02:19:05.44
And not only did I immediately feel more vulnerable than I just in the prone position

1586
02:19:05.44 --> 02:19:09.44
That's how we train, that's how we shot most of the time

1587
02:19:09.44 --> 02:19:16.44
I'd never really just let loose from the standing

1588
02:19:16.44 --> 02:19:21.44
And so that really wasn't even kind of an idea in my head so just doing

1589
02:19:21.44 --> 02:19:28.44
A lot of things like in life on the job and the military you learn a lot of the most important lessons

1590
02:19:28.44 --> 02:19:32.44
And kind of the tricks of the trade as you go along

1591
02:19:32.44 --> 02:19:41.44
And laying in the prone surrounded by Taliban is not the way to do it

1592
02:19:41.44 --> 02:19:44.44
At least it wasn't for me during that deployment

1593
02:19:44.44 --> 02:19:53.44
So I learned quickly that the prone position at times on elevated positions on Overwatch

1594
02:19:53.44 --> 02:20:01.44
And at times that even they can't predict it might be a little less

1595
02:20:01.44 --> 02:20:08.44
Less kinetic than others, you know, maybe maybe I would have considered the prone position

1596
02:20:08.44 --> 02:20:12.44
But in that moment, you know not only could I not even see out of my scope

1597
02:20:12.44 --> 02:20:22.44
But laying down and I wasn't frozen by fear it was just you know when rounds are coming down range at you

1598
02:20:22.44 --> 02:20:29.44
Even if it only takes two or three seconds to get up, grab that carrying handle and make moves

1599
02:20:29.44 --> 02:20:33.44
Full it shall have a lot faster than two or three seconds

1600
02:20:33.44 --> 02:20:39.44
And so I learned my lesson but ultimately I'm just thankful that I was not taking out of the fight

1601
02:20:39.44 --> 02:20:48.44
But it was surreal to say the least and almost incomprehensible that

1602
02:20:48.44 --> 02:20:55.44
I mean an hour or maybe less outside of the wire the first time

1603
02:20:55.44 --> 02:21:02.44
You know I was getting lit up with an AK-47

1604
02:21:02.44 --> 02:21:16.44
But I mean I won't maybe not the wake up call I needed but the wake up call that helped immediately put me in the mindset

1605
02:21:16.44 --> 02:21:27.44
And expectations and kind of frame of reference that I needed to be from the second I stepped out of the gate

1606
02:21:27.44 --> 02:21:31.44
And you said that it made you feel more vulnerable

1607
02:21:31.44 --> 02:21:38.44
Because I can see that going two ways one would be the attitude of like I just got shot and I'm good to go

1608
02:21:38.44 --> 02:21:42.44
Bring it and the other one is I've been here for an hour and I've already been shot

1609
02:21:42.44 --> 02:21:48.44
This is going to be a long seven months and you felt like you leaned a little bit towards this could be a long seven months

1610
02:21:48.44 --> 02:21:51.44
I would say completely towards a ladder

1611
02:21:51.44 --> 02:22:00.44
You say that you know not every patrols that exciting you know but you were always prepared

1612
02:22:00.44 --> 02:22:03.44
And again jump it again

1613
02:22:03.44 --> 02:22:06.44
You're on another patrol

1614
02:22:06.44 --> 02:22:09.44
You with Nick, it phrase you, is that how you say it?

1615
02:22:09.44 --> 02:22:18.44
You with Nick, it phrase you, my best friend was out on the canal and exposed when all of a sudden bullets started to hail down on us

1616
02:22:18.44 --> 02:22:23.44
We began while we began manning the VCP

1617
02:22:23.44 --> 02:22:33.44
Taliban had set up three shooters no more than a hundred yards away at different angles in what's called a bare paw formation to try and triangulate and wipe us out

1618
02:22:33.44 --> 02:22:41.44
We could see their heads as they ran along the canals by the tree line I happened to be positioned by the compound on the other side of the road

1619
02:22:41.44 --> 02:22:48.44
Lance Corporal Stranger the team leader at the time peered over the edge of the canal to see if our guys could safely return fire

1620
02:22:48.44 --> 02:22:54.44
When his head flew backward like he'd been punched it looked like a bullet had gone straight into his forehead

1621
02:22:54.44 --> 02:22:59.44
For a moment he sat perfectly still blinking in a days then he shook it off

1622
02:22:59.44 --> 02:23:09.44
Miraculously the bullet had struck his helmet and the Kevlar had done its job warping the track of the bullet so that it skimmed the edge of his helmet rather than lodging in his skull

1623
02:23:09.44 --> 02:23:14.44
I had a 200 round drum ready already loaded onto my squad automatic weapon

1624
02:23:14.44 --> 02:23:18.44
So I called the guys get ready to move when I turned the corner of this building I prepared to unload

1625
02:23:18.44 --> 02:23:24.44
I turned the corner of the compound pressed my finger on the trigger and didn't let up while the other guys ran in a cross position

1626
02:23:24.44 --> 02:23:31.44
Down the dried up canal before hopping out to cross the road and take cover in the compound until the fire went fight was over

1627
02:23:31.44 --> 02:23:33.44
There's a classic example of cover and move

1628
02:23:33.44 --> 02:23:44.44
Doc friend told me later that he could see the bullet striking the wall right next to my head and body as at least one of the shooters returned turned his weapon on me

1629
02:23:44.44 --> 02:23:49.44
Nick who'd been lobbying grenades in the direction of the shooters in an effort to clear the area long enough

1630
02:23:49.44 --> 02:23:58.44
To give the other guys a chance to run was the last of our guys to cross exactly the moment when he made it across the road and behind the wall

1631
02:23:58.44 --> 02:24:05.44
I ran out of rounds for the next two hours. We were engaged in intense fire fight until a mortarman corporal vans wrath

1632
02:24:05.44 --> 02:24:15.44
Awesome name was able to respond to our radio calls back at base and drop mortars on the Taliban with pinpoint pursuit precision almost two miles out

1633
02:24:15.44 --> 02:24:21.44
After we were confident that there were no active shooters left we approached the shooters position to do a battlefield damage assessment

1634
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:28.44
Bullet caseings littered the ground those guys have been busy incredibly none of our men had been injured that day

1635
02:24:28.44 --> 02:24:33.44
But the incident shook us up our squads had already taken an incredible beating that autumn

1636
02:24:33.44 --> 02:24:41.44
While that initial what it initially started as a platoon of three fire squads broke into up into four in order to cover more ground

1637
02:24:41.44 --> 02:24:46.44
But we lost so many guys we had to reorganize and combine back down to three

1638
02:24:51.44 --> 02:24:58.44
No matter how mentally prepared you are or you think you are you will never be ready for that first firefight let alone the first casualty

1639
02:24:58.44 --> 02:25:06.44
A guy gets blown apart by an ID or takes a bullet to the chest and suddenly everything you've ever believed about the world collapses in a moment

1640
02:25:06.44 --> 02:25:16.44
I turned 21 on October 17th but the day really didn't make me feel any older my inexperiences and Afghanistan however felt like they aged me years at a time

1641
02:25:16.44 --> 02:25:25.44
We had left early in the afternoon on my birthday and we were now trying to make it back to patrol base beatly by nightfall

1642
02:25:25.44 --> 02:25:36.44
It had been a four hour game of cat and mouse as we entered one patch of woods our patrol had frozen missed mid step as the dreaded sound of 203 fire echoed all around us

1643
02:25:36.44 --> 02:25:42.44
A 203 is a grenade launcher that attaches to the bottom of rifle and when fired it makes a distinct foam sound

1644
02:25:42.44 --> 02:25:47.44
Followed by an anxious wait to see where that deadly foam impacts

1645
02:25:47.44 --> 02:25:55.44
Immediately our squad leader got in the radio to tell the other half of our squad to stop firing 203 until we could get their exact location

1646
02:25:55.44 --> 02:26:06.44
We had intentionally split up to cover more ground but during the intense fighting through the thick tree lines and scattered villages we had become unsure of our exact proximity to one another

1647
02:26:06.44 --> 02:26:19.44
A voice crackled over the radio that's not us those are not our 203's in an instant we went from frozen to executing some quick maneuvers to find cover for the first time in three months the enemy was launched grenades at us

1648
02:26:19.44 --> 02:26:21.44
Happy birthday to me

1649
02:26:21.44 --> 02:26:25.44
Yeah, never split forces

1650
02:26:25.44 --> 02:26:27.44
That's what I'm going to do

1651
02:26:27.44 --> 02:26:37.44
If you can avoid it, that's why you guys pulled it off, but it's so dangerous when you end up splitting forces. I know we didn't have to do it. I shouldn't say never split forces use caution

1652
02:26:37.44 --> 02:26:40.44
Yeah, plan think communicate

1653
02:26:40.44 --> 02:26:45.44
You continue on here maneuvering out of the tree line. We approached a compound on the outskirts of the village we were nearing

1654
02:26:45.44 --> 02:26:52.44
As usual family livestock we're hanging out at the home two goats were tied up to a tree the chicken strung it around pecking at the ground

1655
02:26:52.44 --> 02:26:59.44
We slowed down just in time to hear another dreaded fump from the 203 the scene couldn't have been scripted more perfectly the grenade rip through the air

1656
02:26:59.44 --> 02:27:10.44
Struck a chicken vaporizing it in a d instant. I felt terrible for the chicken but part of me had to laugh because I was just relieved that our latest casualty wasn't another marine

1657
02:27:10.44 --> 02:27:18.44
Before that battle was over I vividly remember crawling through the field with my weapon on my back holding the barrel over my shoulder to keep it as clean as possible

1658
02:27:18.44 --> 02:27:28.44
Crawling just under the trajectory of incoming bullets. I couldn't help but think how strange it was that I might not even make it to enjoy my first legal beer

1659
02:27:28.44 --> 02:27:34.44
That's a hell of a 21st birthday. You got going on there. I won't forget it. That's for sure

1660
02:27:34.44 --> 02:27:40.44
When you're when you're doing these missions, where were you guys based out of? Were you guys just based out of a forward operating base somewhere?

1661
02:27:40.44 --> 02:27:53.44
Petrol base a single as you know kind of mud hut compound type setup. We had a few F.G. and National Army members attached to us

1662
02:27:53.44 --> 02:28:04.44
But it was just myself and my platoon when we started roughly 60 Marines. Unfortunately, yes, we lost some and had casualties along the way

1663
02:28:04.44 --> 02:28:11.44
But it was just us and as a platoon there at Petrol base beat Lee in

1664
02:28:11.44 --> 02:28:17.44
This specific village in Marja and

1665
02:28:17.44 --> 02:28:27.44
How often were you guys going out on patrol? All day every day. All day every day. So we have all day every day get get your gear on

1666
02:28:27.44 --> 02:28:34.44
What time were you guys going out? So with our four squads we sent out an early morning patrol

1667
02:28:34.44 --> 02:28:41.44
Late morning slash early afternoon late afternoon and a night patrol doing that

1668
02:28:41.44 --> 02:28:47.44
To not only continue to disrupt enemy activity operations

1669
02:28:47.44 --> 02:28:53.44
Continue to expand that area of operation by pushing that enemy out

1670
02:28:53.44 --> 02:28:58.44
But also and just as important

1671
02:28:58.44 --> 02:29:05.44
Showing the civilian population that you really are there for them that you're willing to sacrifice for them

1672
02:29:05.44 --> 02:29:11.44
To do those patrols get rid of that enemy that oppresses them that

1673
02:29:11.44 --> 02:29:16.44
Kills them for wanting to learn how to read

1674
02:29:16.44 --> 02:29:32.44
And so yeah and you know the mission and the kind of structure of your deployment depends on when you are there

1675
02:29:32.44 --> 02:29:44.44
When you're there in time and when you're there in and the operational picture of things

1676
02:29:44.44 --> 02:29:58.44
And with that said we were the second marine unit and some of the first Marines to put boots on the ground in that area

1677
02:29:58.44 --> 02:30:04.44
Potentially you know in history as far as American forces go

1678
02:30:04.44 --> 02:30:10.44
And no one had really been there since the Soviets in the 70s and so

1679
02:30:10.44 --> 02:30:15.44
Because we were there so early on

1680
02:30:15.44 --> 02:30:18.44
You know

1681
02:30:18.44 --> 02:30:22.44
Looking ahead the angle is you want to

1682
02:30:22.44 --> 02:30:26.44
And the big picture give these people a better life

1683
02:30:26.44 --> 02:30:30.44
Help them to wake up every day and not live in fear

1684
02:30:30.44 --> 02:30:35.44
And to hopefully see that better and brighter future

1685
02:30:35.44 --> 02:30:42.44
But to get to that you have to create stability and a foundation

1686
02:30:42.44 --> 02:30:50.44
So if you're there more towards kind of the end of that stability and that structure and your mission changes

1687
02:30:50.44 --> 02:30:54.44
You hold that tempo you hold that stability

1688
02:30:54.44 --> 02:30:58.44
While roads are being built, schools are being opened

1689
02:30:58.44 --> 02:31:01.44
Fresh clean drinking water wells are being dug

1690
02:31:01.44 --> 02:31:11.44
But in order to get to that you have to get rid of the instability, the bad guys, the enemy, the evil people that are creating all of these problems

1691
02:31:11.44 --> 02:31:18.44
So when we were there I would love to say we had this profound mission

1692
02:31:18.44 --> 02:31:26.44
And in a way it was but you know people actually know what are you really doing while you're going out there

1693
02:31:26.44 --> 02:31:31.44
What we're doing while you are outside of your base

1694
02:31:31.44 --> 02:31:39.44
And the simple answer is we would go out every day

1695
02:31:39.44 --> 02:31:45.44
I mean and it's important to note every day from sun up to sun down

1696
02:31:45.44 --> 02:31:49.44
Was a constant and vicious fight for survival

1697
02:31:49.44 --> 02:31:55.44
Every single day was never a question of I wonder if we're going to get shot at today

1698
02:31:55.44 --> 02:31:59.44
It was I wonder when we're going to get shot at today

1699
02:31:59.44 --> 02:32:08.44
And every single day I never walked outside of friendly lines with less than 800 rounds for my saw

1700
02:32:08.44 --> 02:32:14.44
And those a few times where I had to do the whole prayer walk back to base

1701
02:32:14.44 --> 02:32:18.44
Just hoping I have zero rounds

1702
02:32:18.44 --> 02:32:21.44
Please do not shoot us, please do not shoot us

1703
02:32:21.44 --> 02:32:29.44
And after hours of fighting you know you it's kind of wishful thinking you think there's no way we're going to make it all over back to base

1704
02:32:29.44 --> 02:32:31.44
So that getting attacked again

1705
02:32:31.44 --> 02:32:34.44
Thankfully we did during those times

1706
02:32:34.44 --> 02:32:38.44
But we were there in the beginning and our mission was to patrol

1707
02:32:38.44 --> 02:32:43.44
And patrol just met every day all day sending out patrols

1708
02:32:43.44 --> 02:32:49.44
Leaving those friendly lines and walking around until we picked a fight with the enemy

1709
02:32:49.44 --> 02:32:53.44
And as crazy as it sounds that was the most efficient way to do it

1710
02:32:53.44 --> 02:33:02.44
You go out you upset them because again you're trying to give this region these people a better life

1711
02:33:02.44 --> 02:33:11.44
And I think in a way you're showing them the people that they really are

1712
02:33:11.44 --> 02:33:17.44
And these Marines have to be here because you are such terrible and evil people

1713
02:33:17.44 --> 02:33:20.44
Because as both of you know

1714
02:33:20.44 --> 02:33:26.44
And so that's what we did all day every day we would go out and we'll walk around until we picked a fight with the enemy

1715
02:33:26.44 --> 02:33:32.44
They came to us and we either continued to push them further out or eliminated them

1716
02:33:32.44 --> 02:33:37.44
That's a hell of an opt-up

1717
02:33:37.44 --> 02:33:41.44
So how big was each patrols each patrol squad?

1718
02:33:41.44 --> 02:33:42.44
Squad

1719
02:33:42.44 --> 02:33:48.44
And as you guys wrote that you'd get so for a few days you'd be the morning patrol then you'd be the afternoon patrol

1720
02:33:48.44 --> 02:33:50.44
Then you'd be the afternoon patrols and you'd be the afternoons that how you'd rotate that

1721
02:33:50.44 --> 02:33:59.44
Yeah a few weeks to maybe a month and you know we wanted that continuity of if you're a night patrol operating with those MVGs

1722
02:33:59.44 --> 02:34:05.44
You know obviously we knew how to use them and we're effective with them

1723
02:34:05.44 --> 02:34:15.44
But just keeping you know that rhythm that you know in your comfortable with and then you know we would have those transitional periods where

1724
02:34:15.44 --> 02:34:19.44
You know we might go for night patrol to early afternoon patrol

1725
02:34:19.44 --> 02:34:29.44
But you know to keep that presence and and strive for that stability we always kept to patrol out

1726
02:34:29.44 --> 02:34:39.44
You say here again I'm always impressed with your perspective as a young Marine there

1727
02:34:39.44 --> 02:34:44.44
You say I think a lot about the afghan people who were threatened with violence if they didn't raise a gun against the Americans

1728
02:34:44.44 --> 02:34:52.44
On the surface it would be easy to classify them all as the enemy but some of them just wanted to be left alone to raise their families in peace

1729
02:34:52.44 --> 02:34:58.44
How quickly did I dismiss people based on circumstances I didn't fully understand

1730
02:34:58.44 --> 02:35:05.44
And what about the way people react to extremely high stress high stakes situations previously

1731
02:35:05.44 --> 02:35:09.44
I might have regarded someone's panic or coping mechanisms as a sign of weakness

1732
02:35:09.44 --> 02:35:16.44
But that was before I ever I had never lived with this kind of pressure and trauma before

1733
02:35:16.44 --> 02:35:24.44
I know now how the horrific casualties I witnessed deeply impacted me, but what about the perspective of the guy who got hit?

1734
02:35:24.44 --> 02:35:29.44
What about his family in an instant their lives changed forever in ways I couldn't fathom?

1735
02:35:29.44 --> 02:35:36.44
I started asking myself when I am having an unshower dehydrated meal far away from home kind of day

1736
02:35:36.44 --> 02:35:38.44
How do I react?

1737
02:35:38.44 --> 02:35:48.44
How do I view myself and what does it mean that there are still people out there millions of them who have still got it worse than I do?

1738
02:35:48.44 --> 02:35:58.44
They say there are no atheists and foxholes I think maybe we all become philosophers in combat outposts as well

1739
02:35:58.44 --> 02:36:05.44
So you're seeing these things and you're thinking about them that's that's awesome

1740
02:36:05.44 --> 02:36:10.44
That you perceive these things even as a young as a young kid

1741
02:36:10.44 --> 02:36:11.44
Thank you.

1742
02:36:11.44 --> 02:36:24.44
I give you maximum credit for your and what's good is that as you write this stuff down and you look back and you see how it affected you

1743
02:36:24.44 --> 02:36:33.44
And it's neat to see in the arc of the book and again you got to read this book you can follow the arc of how you assemble these things

1744
02:36:33.44 --> 02:36:40.44
And you know you started off earlier in this conversation talking about how what you went through kind of prepared you for

1745
02:36:40.44 --> 02:36:48.44
What came and you can as you start as you read this book you put those pieces together and you can kind of see it form it's awesome

1746
02:36:48.44 --> 02:36:51.44
Continuing on here

1747
02:36:51.44 --> 02:37:00.44
There were certain sounds I never would have imagined that I could tune out like AK47's being shot at me with the intent to kill but at some point your brain starts

1748
02:37:00.44 --> 02:37:04.44
Registering certain input as more of a nuisance than a threat

1749
02:37:04.44 --> 02:37:13.44
Besides bullets were not our main concern we were focused on avoiding the IEDs that were stretched across roadways walking paths and inside of walls

1750
02:37:13.44 --> 02:37:20.44
They taken quite a toll on two nine on September 30 if Lance Corporal Timothy M Jackson had been killed by an IED

1751
02:37:20.44 --> 02:37:24.44
Then in mid November IEDs had taken out two more of our guys

1752
02:37:24.44 --> 02:37:30.44
One of those remarkable Marines was our squad leader Zach Stinson who stepped on an IED

1753
02:37:30.44 --> 02:37:43.44
That had been placed underground near a wall that separated two villages the scariest thing about the IED is that without a metal detector a well placed one can be almost impossible to spot even in broad daylight

1754
02:37:43.44 --> 02:37:54.44
You lucky if the person who placed the IED is in experienced or lazy because they will lead leave red flags like disturbed dirt or a small trash pile that looks like it might have been constructed to hide something

1755
02:37:54.44 --> 02:38:02.44
At about one PM we were walking on patrol through one of the dried up irrigation canals that crisscross the landscape

1756
02:38:02.44 --> 02:38:09.44
We were scanning the terrain for town abandon making our way toward the next town we needed to secure when another dreaded explosion went off

1757
02:38:09.44 --> 02:38:19.44
The shockwave of the blast rippled through our patrol. I was the fourth man in the patrol. The cloud of dust engulfed me as the debris rained down

1758
02:38:19.44 --> 02:38:24.44
The stomach wrenching curiosity of who had been hit began to sink in

1759
02:38:24.44 --> 02:38:32.44
It took a few seconds to locate Stinson because he had been blown about 15 feet and was on the other side of the wall of the canal

1760
02:38:32.44 --> 02:38:39.44
We found him folded in half like a lawn chair. He was his one remaining foot was up by his head and his legs were mangled

1761
02:38:39.44 --> 02:38:46.44
Christopher Doc friend our corpsman quickly evaluated the scene and announced I think Stinson is dead

1762
02:38:46.44 --> 02:38:52.44
I didn't seem possible it didn't seem possible anyone could survive that incredibly Stinson called out

1763
02:38:52.44 --> 02:39:00.44
I'm not dead. I just can't move Doc rushed over to administer triage care while other Marines called in medical evacuation helicopter

1764
02:39:00.44 --> 02:39:02.44
And our squad move to provide cover

1765
02:39:02.44 --> 02:39:06.44
Just as we got into position in surgeons open fire and began their attack

1766
02:39:06.44 --> 02:39:13.44
They often attack after an ID blast because they know that our corpsman will be with the casualties leaving us exposed invulnerable

1767
02:39:13.44 --> 02:39:21.44
Doc tried to pull Stinson stinson down to a safe location while I laid down fire to suppress the shooters

1768
02:39:21.44 --> 02:39:28.44
The other Marines rushed to help the doc drag Stinson to safety behind the other canal wall

1769
02:39:28.44 --> 02:39:31.44
As they did they realized that one of his legs was no longer attached to his body

1770
02:39:31.44 --> 02:39:41.44
What was left simply stayed on the ground as he was dragged around the corner when Doc applied turnicates stinson asked us to take care of his wife back home

1771
02:39:41.44 --> 02:39:48.44
Who was pregnant and he talked to us about our mission doc gave him an injection of morphine for the pain

1772
02:39:48.44 --> 02:39:51.44
But it didn't knock him out he somehow remained conscious

1773
02:39:51.44 --> 02:40:00.44
We remained under attack the entire time we waited for the medical evacuation helicopter to arrive almost 50 minutes

1774
02:40:00.44 --> 02:40:04.44
It was the worst thing I ever witnessed

1775
02:40:04.44 --> 02:40:15.44
You pointed out that moment of this explosion takes place

1776
02:40:15.44 --> 02:40:19.44
It's close to you close enough that you're engulfed and dust

1777
02:40:19.44 --> 02:40:23.44
At some point in the following seconds you realize you're okay

1778
02:40:23.44 --> 02:40:27.44
And the very first thought that goes through your head is like okay

1779
02:40:27.44 --> 02:40:29.44
Someone is not okay

1780
02:40:29.44 --> 02:40:32.44
You don't even want to look around

1781
02:40:32.44 --> 02:40:36.44
Because someone had to have initiated that

1782
02:40:36.44 --> 02:40:45.44
ID and so you have to obviously you are concerned to say the least

1783
02:40:45.44 --> 02:40:51.44
You want to get to them as quickly as possible to take care of them to comfort them

1784
02:40:51.44 --> 02:41:01.44
But you don't want to look around and survey and look for

1785
02:41:01.44 --> 02:41:04.44
And discover who that is

1786
02:41:08.44 --> 02:41:10.44
50 minutes for the

1787
02:41:10.44 --> 02:41:13.44
Evac to get there

1788
02:41:14.44 --> 02:41:17.44
You continue on a few hours later this is after the

1789
02:41:17.44 --> 02:41:24.44
Caches the evacuation a few hours later after the sun and set I was on my shift as radio watch back at patrol base

1790
02:41:24.44 --> 02:41:31.44
Abitly listening to information as it came in from the Marines who were outside of the wire during the silence of breaks in the radio traffic

1791
02:41:31.44 --> 02:41:35.44
I couldn't help but let my mind wander back to the hour before was since and still alive

1792
02:41:35.44 --> 02:41:42.44
How would his wife and family handle the news would I be able to survive something like that if it if or when it happened to me

1793
02:41:42.44 --> 02:41:48.44
As my brain raised to compartmentalize the recent past my present reality suddenly became even worse

1794
02:41:48.44 --> 02:41:53.44
Loose dirt crumbled out of the cracks in the wall as the room shook

1795
02:41:53.44 --> 02:41:58.44
A second later the sound of a massive explosion reached us more than a mile away

1796
02:41:58.44 --> 02:42:05.44
Lance Corporal Dakota Hughes had been making his way through the dark fields and tree lines with his squad on night patrol

1797
02:42:05.44 --> 02:42:13.44
They were moving toward a village to our south the Taliban would flood fields in order to make it harder for us to advance quickly

1798
02:42:13.44 --> 02:42:21.44
The inundated fields didn't slow down our tall guys much because the water was only about as high as their boots

1799
02:42:21.44 --> 02:42:27.44
But for shorter guys like Dakota and me the water was up to our ankles and even our calves at times

1800
02:42:27.44 --> 02:42:36.44
Between the water our 22 pound squad automatic weapons 20 to 30 pounds of machine gun ammo and 45 pounds of gear

1801
02:42:36.44 --> 02:42:39.44
It was hard to move quickly and the Taliban knew that

1802
02:42:39.44 --> 02:42:47.44
As Hughes and his squad approached the village he reached a goat path a small trail that surrounds an agricultural field

1803
02:42:47.44 --> 02:42:52.44
And allows locals to travel through the patchwork of land without triggering their crops

1804
02:42:52.44 --> 02:43:00.44
Stepping onto it a few moments later 19 year old Dakota from Greenwood Louisiana took his last step

1805
02:43:00.44 --> 02:43:18.44
And breath on this earth so this

1806
02:43:18.44 --> 02:43:28.44
Do you find out immediately that you know that he was KIA?

1807
02:43:28.44 --> 02:43:35.44
It was that could be gathered from the radio traffic and the fact that

1808
02:43:35.44 --> 02:43:45.44
And I'm hesitant to go in to detail just in case his family

1809
02:43:45.44 --> 02:43:53.44
I ever listened to this but at the same time I think

1810
02:43:53.44 --> 02:43:58.44
I think that it's important for people to know what really happens

1811
02:43:58.44 --> 02:44:04.44
Sacrifices that are really made

1812
02:44:04.44 --> 02:44:10.44
And so if we couldn't conclude that from the radio traffic

1813
02:44:10.44 --> 02:44:18.44
When they got back to our patrol base they didn't call on a metavac

1814
02:44:18.44 --> 02:44:38.44
They couldn't even bring Hughes back because the idea had been so big and inflicted so much damage that

1815
02:44:38.44 --> 02:44:58.44
It would not have been wise at dark to start walking all over that field to look for the pieces of Hughes that were left

1816
02:44:58.44 --> 02:45:08.44
And was that the first guy from your patrol that was killed?

1817
02:45:08.44 --> 02:45:14.44
Because since he had been cast back and he survived

1818
02:45:14.44 --> 02:45:23.44
He survived and yeah it was amazing now he's completely outnumbered by enemy forces with not one but two baby girls now

1819
02:45:23.44 --> 02:45:29.44
But he's doing amazing he's crushing marathons on his hand cycle

1820
02:45:29.44 --> 02:45:33.44
Just finished his first Iron Man I take something like two

1821
02:45:33.44 --> 02:45:40.44
Take it easy man you're really making all this guys with both our legs and healthy look bad

1822
02:45:40.44 --> 02:45:47.44
But he's doing amazing and hopefully if he keeps he keeps working hard

1823
02:45:47.44 --> 02:45:55.44
Which he always has and I keep doing well I hope that maybe one day soon or rather later

1824
02:45:55.44 --> 02:46:01.44
He will be representing our country potentially and the parallelmpics

1825
02:46:01.44 --> 02:46:07.44
So he's done amazing and we recovered together and really grew our relationship

1826
02:46:07.44 --> 02:46:11.44
At Walter Reed for the years that we were there

1827
02:46:11.44 --> 02:46:18.44
And I'm glad you brought the story up because as we talked about

1828
02:46:18.44 --> 02:46:23.44
Leadership is vital obviously

1829
02:46:23.44 --> 02:46:34.44
And no marine is ever from the first day of boot camp as a recruit or a marine that's been in 40 years compared to a marine that's been in a week

1830
02:46:34.44 --> 02:46:41.44
No one lives no marine is more important than those to your right and left

1831
02:46:41.44 --> 02:46:49.44
But stints in was the highest ranking marine and leader he was our squad leader on that patrol

1832
02:46:49.44 --> 02:47:02.44
Leadership is especially important in vital on the battlefield not only to communicate that strategic information to hire up

1833
02:47:02.44 --> 02:47:08.44
So then you're trained to command to keep that order in discipline on the battlefield

1834
02:47:08.44 --> 02:47:16.44
And arguably most importantly to direct troop movements during engagement with the enemy

1835
02:47:16.44 --> 02:47:24.44
So although he's not more important his job it could be argued is more important

1836
02:47:24.44 --> 02:47:34.44
And is the most vital role out of our squad that needs to last as long as possible

1837
02:47:34.44 --> 02:47:49.44
So with that said from the moment that I did went off I had always wondered why did that happen

1838
02:47:49.44 --> 02:47:57.44
And not why did it happen as as and why was there an ID there but why was stints in specifically the casualty we took

1839
02:47:57.44 --> 02:48:07.44
And when I speak to companies and corporations I relay this story because I think it is one of the greatest examples of leadership

1840
02:48:07.44 --> 02:48:16.44
But years later we're sitting in his Walter Reed wounded warrior barracks room

1841
02:48:16.44 --> 02:48:23.44
And it was they were nice it was more not Marine Corps barracks it was they were a little more luxurious

1842
02:48:23.44 --> 02:48:32.44
They had a couple of bedrooms and your family could live there with you while you were covered and so you could have that support system

1843
02:48:32.44 --> 02:48:41.44
And we're sitting there and watching his pn and he's in his wheelchair while Olivia

1844
02:48:41.44 --> 02:48:48.44
His daughter was an amazing moment at least just me I didn't see anything but his daughter that he had in his what we thought

1845
02:48:48.44 --> 02:48:56.44
Where his final moments given us you know his final request take care of my wife and my unborn first child

1846
02:48:56.44 --> 02:49:05.44
And baby daughter and she's Olivia crawling all over and all of his wheelchair you know what's what's left of his legs

1847
02:49:05.44 --> 02:49:18.44
And in that moment time and past we had healed we had got to better places and so I finally got the opportunity years later to ask him what I'd always wondered that question

1848
02:49:18.44 --> 02:49:27.44
And his answer was very simple but very profound and he said I'm just glad it was me and not one of you guys

1849
02:49:27.44 --> 02:49:42.44
And so you have to know as a leader that your responsibility is laced with risk and that if and when that risk comes to fruition

1850
02:49:42.44 --> 02:49:54.44
You not only are obligated but you are you are expected

1851
02:49:54.44 --> 02:50:01.44
To bear the burden for those that you lead

1852
02:50:01.44 --> 02:50:10.44
And so since and taught me a very powerful lesson that I've always carried with me and I'm very thankful that of course he not only survived

1853
02:50:10.44 --> 02:50:16.44
But he continued to be able to hear and teach me things along the way as we were covered together

1854
02:50:16.44 --> 02:50:26.44
Yeah that's what we talked about earlier I mean he proved that moment you know that he cared about you guys more than he cared about himself

1855
02:50:26.44 --> 02:50:29.44
Which is one of good leaders going to do

1856
02:50:29.44 --> 02:50:47.44
And when it's corporal to go to use we had many casualties but he was our second killed in action and 12 days later at our new

1857
02:50:47.44 --> 02:50:58.44
Petrol base that we were living and operating out of named Petrol base Dakota is where I was injured about a week and a half later

1858
02:50:58.44 --> 02:51:06.44
Well after after that had happened after you lost use to that ID

1859
02:51:06.44 --> 02:51:14.44
I'm going back to the book here it says 10 days later word came from command that we needed to expand our area of operation to create more of a presence in the area

1860
02:51:14.44 --> 02:51:20.44
My squad got orders to help establish a new compound and the village to the south

1861
02:51:20.44 --> 02:51:25.44
The same one we're used and stepped on the ID because it was a Taliban stronghold in the region

1862
02:51:25.44 --> 02:51:31.44
So there you go you went with the Marine Corps does that's what they do. Oh, we got a problem cool we're going to go attack the problem

1863
02:51:31.44 --> 02:51:35.44
The village was tiny no bigger than a hotel conference room

1864
02:51:35.44 --> 02:51:41.44
And the home we were occupying was only two stories high though it was one of the largest structures in the area

1865
02:51:41.44 --> 02:51:52.44
Unfortunately the intel we'd received proved accurate that there were Taliban and the village and they weren't happy about our arrival and the choice of landing spot

1866
02:51:52.44 --> 02:51:56.44
And again skipping a bunch of stuff you guys are now

1867
02:51:56.44 --> 02:52:00.44
Kind of in this in this new position as the afternoon sunlight started to fade

1868
02:52:00.44 --> 02:52:08.44
I was instructed to get off the roof and keep post in the room directly below. This is after you had spent a bunch of time in YouTube great job covering this in the book of

1869
02:52:08.44 --> 02:52:16.44
You're up there trying to build put put some sandbag protection up and there's a guy basically taking sniper shots at you

1870
02:52:16.44 --> 02:52:24.44
And you're just staying up there staying low people handing you up full sandbags you're putting them in position every time you put it in a position

1871
02:52:24.44 --> 02:52:26.44
Boamy cracks off around at you

1872
02:52:26.44 --> 02:52:28.44
So

1873
02:52:28.44 --> 02:52:34.44
Yeah, it was probably a really stupid assumption at the time that he had a single ball action rifle

1874
02:52:34.44 --> 02:52:38.44
But I thought that's the what I gathered from the first couple shots

1875
02:52:38.44 --> 02:52:51.44
And so thankfully he was nice enough. He didn't start shooting at me until I got three sandbags high of a kind of semi circle wall on that roof and around me so when he did start shooting

1876
02:52:51.44 --> 02:52:54.44
If I laid completely flat

1877
02:52:54.44 --> 02:53:04.44
I was covered by those sandbags, but for the most part. Yeah, yeah, but it was a it was eerie to

1878
02:53:04.44 --> 02:53:10.44
Be behind those sandbags laying up against them and I can still feel right now

1879
02:53:10.44 --> 02:53:19.44
When he would take those shots and usually the Taliban weren't extremely accurate especially I mean we

1880
02:53:19.44 --> 02:53:28.44
Rarely if ever up until this point saw snipers and if we did they were not accurate and so that was surprising

1881
02:53:28.44 --> 02:53:37.44
But it was just so eerie to lay behind those sandbags and when we heard the crack of the rifle to be able to feel

1882
02:53:37.44 --> 02:53:45.44
Because of you so accurate the thud of that round impacting the sandbags that I was laying up against

1883
02:53:45.44 --> 02:53:52.44
Yeah, as you said it may not have been the best decision to stay up there

1884
02:53:52.44 --> 02:53:54.44
Add it to the list

1885
02:53:54.44 --> 02:54:03.44
We live and learn so then finally you do you do get instructed to get off the roof and move to a room below and then you say this

1886
02:54:03.44 --> 02:54:08.44
I gouged out a little hole in the wall so I could get a better vantage point about 45 seconds later

1887
02:54:08.44 --> 02:54:11.44
A rocket came barreling into the roof and the sandbag wall

1888
02:54:11.44 --> 02:54:15.44
I just built completely a blitter rating the post position

1889
02:54:15.44 --> 02:54:21.44
It was as if I had stepped into the middle of a tornado the debris cloud surrounding me was so thick that I couldn't

1890
02:54:21.44 --> 02:54:29.44
See and couldn't breathe my squad members immediately realized what happened to the roof and Doc friend was scrambling for his medic bag ready to rush

1891
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:36.44
In and see if there were any signs of life somehow I wasn't injured and was able to get up and walk out of the room on my own

1892
02:54:38.44 --> 02:54:45.44
So that they obviously don't want you there continuing on we officially lost the roof as a vantage point from this post

1893
02:54:45.44 --> 02:54:54.44
We were now facing four major challenges the first was we had probably we that we had previously had two positions in the compound on each of the two roofs

1894
02:54:54.44 --> 02:55:00.44
But now we only had one so we had to double up on the remaining roof the second was that it wasn't a great position to begin with

1895
02:55:00.44 --> 02:55:13.44
Since we couldn't see as far out as we would have liked to from just two stories up the third was that we were now dangerously low on sandbags and fourth was that because we only had enough sandbags for a three to four foot stack

1896
02:55:13.44 --> 02:55:22.44
We would have to stand post into somewhat recline position in order to not be exposed that meant the enemy could sneak right up alongside the building in

1897
02:55:22.44 --> 02:55:27.44
Throne explosive over the compound wall or fired us then dart away

1898
02:55:27.44 --> 02:55:31.44
The weakness of our position was proved almost immediately

1899
02:55:31.44 --> 02:55:38.44
We heard a thud thud thud from the courtyard outside the building as if someone were tossing something over the wall compound

1900
02:55:38.44 --> 02:55:45.44
There was just enough time to ask who's throwing rocks before the first round of explosions began they weren't rocks

1901
02:55:45.44 --> 02:55:51.44
They were grenades Brad Skipper had been sitting outside as he cleaned his weapon and he took off running for cover

1902
02:55:51.44 --> 02:55:54.44
As he took off running for cover a grenade exploded near him

1903
02:55:54.44 --> 02:55:58.44
He staggered into the house squirting blood from a hole in his spleen

1904
02:55:58.44 --> 02:56:04.44
I had been outside in the courtyard of the compound helping dig a burn pit and fill more sandbags when I saw what happened

1905
02:56:04.44 --> 02:56:08.44
I took off after Skipper reaching the house just a few seconds after him

1906
02:56:08.44 --> 02:56:13.44
Doc who was inside stuck his finger and discipers wound to stop the bleeding while he grabbed his supplies

1907
02:56:13.44 --> 02:56:16.44
Skipper kept pounding on his chest to tell us he couldn't breathe

1908
02:56:16.44 --> 02:56:19.44
I kneeled down next to his head as sureing him he was going to be okay

1909
02:56:19.44 --> 02:56:24.44
And that pretty soon we'd have all the ice-geet have all the ice cream you could eat in the hospital

1910
02:56:24.44 --> 02:56:29.44
Doc grabbed what he needed and performed a needle deep compression on Skipper for a collapsed lung

1911
02:56:29.44 --> 02:56:31.44
It was the first one he'd ever performed

1912
02:56:31.44 --> 02:56:35.44
I crazed watching them jam the needle into the skippers into Skipper's side

1913
02:56:35.44 --> 02:56:41.44
But when he heard what's what when we heard what sounded like a balloon letting out air as Skipper's long re-inflate

1914
02:56:41.44 --> 02:56:46.44
As Skipper's long re-inflated we all wanted to high five dock

1915
02:56:46.44 --> 02:56:54.44
But he was a little busy Jake below tame I say in that right below Jake below who had been outside the courtyard in the courtyard

1916
02:56:54.44 --> 02:56:59.44
Made his way to the house as well. Why does she covered him blood from where Shrapple had hit him in the groin?

1917
02:56:59.44 --> 02:57:01.44
Two things were abundantly clear to me

1918
02:57:01.44 --> 02:57:04.44
Cornman our worth their waiting gold and PB Dakota

1919
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:07.44
Was not going to be easily held

1920
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:09.44
So

1921
02:57:09.44 --> 02:57:19.44
You get those guys out of there right you get those guys cows of act we did and we also lost one of the few

1922
02:57:19.44 --> 02:57:28.44
It's just a casualty but who was also who was Shrapple and I wanted the few Afghanistan National Army members that had gone down on this mission with a

1923
02:57:28.44 --> 02:57:33.44
And so right there immediately just from hangar nades and not even leaving

1924
02:57:33.44 --> 02:57:40.44
Our four walls of our patrol base we were down three guys and we had all gone down there with a

1925
02:57:40.44 --> 02:57:49.44
Squad and arguably a small squad and our mission and we did this to give people listening context

1926
02:57:49.44 --> 02:57:53.44
We were over the halfway point of our deployment

1927
02:57:53.44 --> 02:57:58.44
When you're you know we stood three months, but when you're you can see the end inside

1928
02:57:58.44 --> 02:58:04.44
You know that at seven months whether you want to or not your times up you're going back home

1929
02:58:04.44 --> 02:58:08.44
And another unit is going to come in and relieve you

1930
02:58:08.44 --> 02:58:14.44
To prepare for that and to continue to

1931
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:18.44
Keep the momentum going of an efficient mission

1932
02:58:18.44 --> 02:58:25.44
Just like with anything in live hopefully you want to leave it better than you found it

1933
02:58:25.44 --> 02:58:31.44
So you know say and and this is random numbers

1934
02:58:31.44 --> 02:58:37.44
I don't know what they are but say our area of operation was was two square miles

1935
02:58:37.44 --> 02:58:43.44
Looking ahead to that next deployment and leaving things better for them

1936
02:58:43.44 --> 02:58:48.44
Then when you got there you want to expand your area of operation

1937
02:58:48.44 --> 02:58:55.44
To continue to push that enemy out and continue that mission of creating stability

1938
02:58:55.44 --> 02:59:00.44
Which we've we've already talked about so

1939
02:59:00.44 --> 02:59:09.44
When that time frame is drawing to an end you want to like we did push into those outer

1940
02:59:09.44 --> 02:59:14.44
Outscirt villages from your area of operation and doing that

1941
02:59:14.44 --> 02:59:18.44
Again those nothing sexy about this mission

1942
02:59:18.44 --> 02:59:25.44
We were to go down there pack as much as we could in a bag in a day pack

1943
02:59:25.44 --> 02:59:31.44
Food water ammo and stick your foot in the ground

1944
02:59:31.44 --> 02:59:37.44
Don't move and try to survive for the next few days until we can get you reinforcements

1945
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:44.44
And that is the first step that I was talking about earlier that you need

1946
02:59:44.44 --> 02:59:50.44
To accomplish in order for years down the road to have a school across the street

1947
02:59:50.44 --> 02:59:55.44
To have those fresh clean drinking water wells

1948
02:59:55.44 --> 03:00:00.44
And so that was our mission getting down there on November 19th

1949
03:00:00.44 --> 03:00:06.44
Rockets multiple hand grenade attacks multiple casualties

1950
03:00:06.44 --> 03:00:09.44
And our numbers weren't strong to begin with

1951
03:00:09.44 --> 03:00:16.44
And now with those three casualties we're already creeping towards

1952
03:00:16.44 --> 03:00:25.44
Not only being combat ineffective but just for self preservation, needing reinforcements

1953
03:00:25.44 --> 03:00:29.44
Yes, this is a rough situation

1954
03:00:29.44 --> 03:00:35.44
How many people do you have right now? Like what do you down to?

1955
03:00:35.44 --> 03:00:37.44
You know I shouldn't know this especially after

1956
03:00:37.44 --> 03:00:40.44
But I mean just like an estimate you got

1957
03:00:40.44 --> 03:00:43.44
These are squad plus some Afghans is it?

1958
03:00:43.44 --> 03:00:49.44
10 or 11 Marines with a Navy corpsman and then three or four Afghanistan National Army members

1959
03:00:49.44 --> 03:00:52.44
So you got 15 guys roughly

1960
03:00:52.44 --> 03:00:56.44
Generously and with that said

1961
03:00:56.44 --> 03:01:02.44
You know surrounded by villages and miles of enemies

1962
03:01:02.44 --> 03:01:07.44
How far away from you are the how far are you away from the patrol base

1963
03:01:07.44 --> 03:01:11.44
That you let you left to get it down here

1964
03:01:11.44 --> 03:01:14.44
Oh, is it like 500 meters?

1965
03:01:14.44 --> 03:01:17.44
There's like three or four clicks

1966
03:01:17.44 --> 03:01:22.44
Click to at the most maybe a click and a half

1967
03:01:22.44 --> 03:01:24.44
And that's where the rest of your Paltinas

1968
03:01:24.44 --> 03:01:26.44
Correct, still at patrol base beatly

1969
03:01:26.44 --> 03:01:29.44
Then we were setting up patrol base Dakota

1970
03:01:29.44 --> 03:01:33.44
And did you guys have any vehicles there at all?

1971
03:01:33.44 --> 03:01:35.44
It was so then your feet

1972
03:01:35.44 --> 03:01:38.44
Yeah, that's it the Marine vehicles

1973
03:01:38.44 --> 03:01:40.44
No no vehicles

1974
03:01:40.44 --> 03:01:46.44
It was so primitive and there was so little to no infrastructure

1975
03:01:46.44 --> 03:01:52.44
And because there was no paved roads vehicles could not get to where we were

1976
03:01:52.44 --> 03:01:58.44
Not only not having roads but not having roads

1977
03:01:58.44 --> 03:02:03.44
Leeds to dirt paths

1978
03:02:03.44 --> 03:02:06.44
That if you take a seven-ton truck on

1979
03:02:06.44 --> 03:02:12.44
The side of that canal collapses and you have four Marines strapped into an armored vehicle

1980
03:02:12.44 --> 03:02:15.44
Upside down in water

1981
03:02:15.44 --> 03:02:17.44
And so it wasn't worth the risk

1982
03:02:17.44 --> 03:02:19.44
And you know what that said

1983
03:02:19.44 --> 03:02:23.44
We're so far out behind enemy lines

1984
03:02:23.44 --> 03:02:26.44
And that enemy territory that for those seven months

1985
03:02:26.44 --> 03:02:28.44
Well, the four that I survived

1986
03:02:28.44 --> 03:02:31.44
Anything and everything we needed

1987
03:02:31.44 --> 03:02:35.44
From water, food, ammo, medical supplies

1988
03:02:35.44 --> 03:02:40.44
Had to be brought in by aircraft and helicopters

1989
03:02:40.44 --> 03:02:44.44
And I even remember there were times where they brought things at night

1990
03:02:44.44 --> 03:02:47.44
Because during the day a lot of times they would have to you turn

1991
03:02:47.44 --> 03:02:50.44
And return to base and bring it later

1992
03:02:50.44 --> 03:02:55.44
Because you don't want an offspring crashing

1993
03:02:55.44 --> 03:03:00.44
And some random backfield and Marjav Ganeshan

1994
03:03:00.44 --> 03:03:05.44
Especially, I mean hopefully everyone survives

1995
03:03:05.44 --> 03:03:10.44
But having aircraft crash, no vehicles, no support

1996
03:03:10.44 --> 03:03:17.44
No nothing and you're going to potentially have survivors of that aircraft crash

1997
03:03:17.44 --> 03:03:23.44
Immediately be pretty much a blackhawk down situation

1998
03:03:23.44 --> 03:03:28.44
Rough day

1999
03:03:28.44 --> 03:03:30.44
Rough day

2000
03:03:30.44 --> 03:03:34.44
As we were prepping for this, you know, it's today's November 20th

2001
03:03:34.44 --> 03:03:36.44
2019

2002
03:03:36.44 --> 03:03:41.44
And what we just talked about was November 20th, 2010

2003
03:03:41.44 --> 03:03:45.44
Getting to the next day

2004
03:03:45.44 --> 03:03:48.44
So now it's November 21st, 2010

2005
03:03:48.44 --> 03:03:50.44
It's the next day

2006
03:03:50.44 --> 03:03:53.44
Here we go, our solution to the visibility problem

2007
03:03:53.44 --> 03:03:57.44
On post was that we were going to put two people on the roof at the same time

2008
03:03:57.44 --> 03:04:00.44
This gave us an extra set of eyes to help evaluate the scene

2009
03:04:00.44 --> 03:04:03.44
Nick and I began our first shift at noon, it was quite almost eerily so

2010
03:04:03.44 --> 03:04:05.44
During the entire four hour shift

2011
03:04:05.44 --> 03:04:08.44
Because the sandbag walls were so low we had to lean back

2012
03:04:08.44 --> 03:04:10.44
Proped up just enough to see over the edge

2013
03:04:10.44 --> 03:04:12.44
We've only our head and shoulders exposed

2014
03:04:12.44 --> 03:04:17.44
As we scan the weirdly silent village, waiting for something to pop off

2015
03:04:17.44 --> 03:04:20.44
And we went through the different scenarios we might encounter

2016
03:04:20.44 --> 03:04:24.44
If we could attack from this direction, you do this and I'll do this

2017
03:04:24.44 --> 03:04:27.44
But if it's the other direction, we'll need to do this instead

2018
03:04:27.44 --> 03:04:31.44
I was glad to be on post with Nick, especially on that day when something just fell off

2019
03:04:31.44 --> 03:04:35.44
Nick and I started going over the one-fc scenario again

2020
03:04:35.44 --> 03:04:38.44
We hadn't seen any grenades our entire deployment

2021
03:04:38.44 --> 03:04:40.44
That isn't till the day before

2022
03:04:40.44 --> 03:04:43.44
Previously the enemy preferred guns and rockets

2023
03:04:43.44 --> 03:04:46.44
But after seeing grenades thrown over the wall of the compound yesterday

2024
03:04:46.44 --> 03:04:48.44
We now knew they were a possibility

2025
03:04:48.44 --> 03:04:54.44
So Nick, I joked making fun of this of his crazy strong massachusetts accent

2026
03:04:54.44 --> 03:04:56.44
As best I could

2027
03:04:56.44 --> 03:04:59.44
What happens if they throw grenade up here?

2028
03:04:59.44 --> 03:05:03.44
My asses off this effing roofy set

2029
03:05:03.44 --> 03:05:06.44
I laughed dude, I'm right behind you

2030
03:05:06.44 --> 03:05:11.44
So you guys are going through some scenarios that could unfold

2031
03:05:11.44 --> 03:05:13.44
Some what-ifs

2032
03:05:13.44 --> 03:05:16.44
That's what's going on

2033
03:05:16.44 --> 03:05:21.44
So you guys are up there

2034
03:05:21.44 --> 03:05:24.44
And then we get here presumably there is a soft sound

2035
03:05:24.44 --> 03:05:27.44
And a puff of dust is something lands near our feet

2036
03:05:27.44 --> 03:05:28.44
But I don't remember it

2037
03:05:28.44 --> 03:05:31.44
All I know is that my body reacts instinctively before my mind

2038
03:05:31.44 --> 03:05:33.44
Even registers what it is

2039
03:05:33.44 --> 03:05:36.44
Then suddenly it feels like I've been hit really hard in the face

2040
03:05:36.44 --> 03:05:37.44
And I can't see a thing

2041
03:05:37.44 --> 03:05:39.44
It's as if I'm looking at a TV with no connection

2042
03:05:39.44 --> 03:05:41.44
Just white and gray static

2043
03:05:41.44 --> 03:05:44.44
My ears are ringing extremely loud but my body is numb

2044
03:05:44.44 --> 03:05:48.44
There's no connection, no through line, no logical progression of events

2045
03:05:48.44 --> 03:05:50.44
I just remember heat, laughter

2046
03:05:50.44 --> 03:05:52.44
And then a massive impact

2047
03:05:52.44 --> 03:05:56.44
As all of my senses go haywire for reasons I can't explain

2048
03:05:56.44 --> 03:06:02.44
The last thing I remember clearly is laughing with Nick before starting to move towards something

2049
03:06:02.44 --> 03:06:04.44
And here's an official report

2050
03:06:04.44 --> 03:06:07.44
Four eyewitnesses saw Lance Corporal

2051
03:06:07.44 --> 03:06:11.44
Carpenter rise up to a standing or kneeling position immediately prior to the blast

2052
03:06:11.44 --> 03:06:15.44
Multiple eyewitnesses saw Lance Corporal Carpenter's body line

2053
03:06:15.44 --> 03:06:19.44
Directly over the blast hole immediately after the grenade detonator detonated

2054
03:06:19.44 --> 03:06:23.44
The explosive ordinance disposal staff non-commissioned officer attached to the

2055
03:06:23.44 --> 03:06:28.44
Paltoon provided his expert opinion that the grenade had to have been covered by a heavy object

2056
03:06:28.44 --> 03:06:30.44
To blast through the roof

2057
03:06:30.44 --> 03:06:35.44
And that the significant damage done to Lance Corporal Carpenter's personal protective equipment

2058
03:06:35.44 --> 03:06:39.44
Particularly his small arms protective insert, Sappy, played carrier

2059
03:06:39.44 --> 03:06:45.44
Was consistent with the grenade detonating immediately under or in close proximity to his body

2060
03:06:45.44 --> 03:06:50.44
In other words, I threw myself over the grenade apparently

2061
03:06:50.44 --> 03:06:54.44
I don't remember thinking about it and I certainly don't recall actually doing it

2062
03:06:54.44 --> 03:06:59.44
I only remember the after effects a few seconds after the strain just sold on my senses

2063
03:06:59.44 --> 03:07:04.44
I tried to shake it off and push my body up but I couldn't feel my arms

2064
03:07:04.44 --> 03:07:08.44
With every ounce of strength I possessed I worked to push myself up

2065
03:07:08.44 --> 03:07:15.44
But my body simply would not respond the disorientation was overwhelming five seconds before everything seemed normal

2066
03:07:15.44 --> 03:07:18.44
Suddenly I was numb and vaguely aware that I probably should be in pain

2067
03:07:18.44 --> 03:07:20.44
But I could feel nothing at all

2068
03:07:20.44 --> 03:07:22.44
I knew I was alive so I must be okay

2069
03:07:22.44 --> 03:07:28.44
But nothing made sense why couldn't I see what was that deafening roar that was blocking out every other sound

2070
03:07:28.44 --> 03:07:31.44
Where was I and why was everything numb

2071
03:07:31.44 --> 03:07:36.44
Calm down and think the last thing I remember is being on the roof I reasoned in my head

2072
03:07:36.44 --> 03:07:39.44
I wonder what could have entered me this badly on the roof

2073
03:07:39.44 --> 03:07:43.44
Or did I get off the roof and went on patrol and all this is just going on in my head

2074
03:07:43.44 --> 03:07:47.44
Maybe I stepped on an IED and the last thing I remember is being on that roof

2075
03:07:47.44 --> 03:07:50.44
As I was puzzling through these questions

2076
03:07:50.44 --> 03:07:58.44
All of them racing through my mind in a split second my confusion grew even deeper as I realized that someone was pouring warm water all over me

2077
03:07:58.44 --> 03:08:03.44
What was happening nothing made sense and I had no context to even try and make sense out of it

2078
03:08:03.44 --> 03:08:08.44
I was on the roof talking to Nick then this whatever this was

2079
03:08:08.44 --> 03:08:16.44
As I searched for answers my brain was fiercely putting the pieces together to create some kind of meaning and then it clicked this wasn't water

2080
03:08:16.44 --> 03:08:18.44
It was blood

2081
03:08:18.44 --> 03:08:20.44
I was bleeding out

2082
03:08:20.44 --> 03:08:23.44
At that same moment I tried to call for help

2083
03:08:23.44 --> 03:08:28.44
But the only thing I could feel was that my tongue was searching for my lower jaw

2084
03:08:28.44 --> 03:08:31.44
No cheeks, no teeth, no jaw

2085
03:08:31.44 --> 03:08:35.44
It was as if the bottom part of my mouth had disappeared

2086
03:08:35.44 --> 03:08:38.44
A seat of panic started to grow inside me

2087
03:08:38.44 --> 03:08:42.44
Was I just in shock or was I really missing part of my face

2088
03:08:42.44 --> 03:08:46.44
According to the reports a great friend in one of the greatest Marines I've ever known

2089
03:08:46.44 --> 03:08:52.44
Jared Lilly had been watching us from the stairs and was the first one to the roof just seconds after the explosion

2090
03:08:52.44 --> 03:08:54.44
He immediately screamed for Doc Friend

2091
03:08:54.44 --> 03:09:01.44
Normally Doc would have stayed downstairs until we had a chance to sweep the perimeter and make sure that there was no one hiding in an effort to ambush our medic

2092
03:09:01.44 --> 03:09:03.44
But Jared knew there was no time for that

2093
03:09:03.44 --> 03:09:10.44
Doc came pounding up the shaky bamboo ladder from the room below and saw me lying face down on the sandbags with one glance

2094
03:09:10.44 --> 03:09:17.44
He sized up the scene and realized that even though in realized that even though was probably too late for me Nick had a chance

2095
03:09:17.44 --> 03:09:20.44
He had taken shrapnel to the forehead that had blown up

2096
03:09:20.44 --> 03:09:24.44
And under his helmet not good, but he was still breathing

2097
03:09:24.44 --> 03:09:30.44
Well kind of the report said it was more of a snoring sound as his body struggled to pull air into his lungs

2098
03:09:30.44 --> 03:09:36.44
So Doc went to work stabilizing him while the rest of our guys radioed for MetaVax and back up

2099
03:09:36.44 --> 03:09:42.44
There it is

2100
03:09:42.44 --> 03:09:48.44
It's weird I first saw an interview with you with some with you some time along time ago

2101
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:51.44
And I remember you saying yeah, I don't really remember it

2102
03:09:51.44 --> 03:09:56.44
Which is crazy to have this incredible amount of focus on your life story

2103
03:09:56.44 --> 03:10:05.44
On a situation that you don't remember and I've been knocked out before and I mean I imagine this is just like the absolute worst knockout a person can can get

2104
03:10:05.44 --> 03:10:12.44
And you know you wake up and you go away where am I you know I've been knocked out and just you know come to go and know

2105
03:10:12.44 --> 03:10:16.44
Wait a second where am I and that's basically what what you had

2106
03:10:16.44 --> 03:10:28.44
Yeah, and you're exactly right it is you know at in the beginning after five weeks later after I woke up after those what I thought or my final moments on that roof

2107
03:10:28.44 --> 03:10:38.44
It used to frustrate me that I couldn't remember and I don't I don't think it would if there were no external influences

2108
03:10:38.44 --> 03:10:44.44
But knowing that the Marine Corps the military department of defense and

2109
03:10:44.44 --> 03:10:51.44
In a way the whole country and world we're looking into talking about examining

2110
03:10:51.44 --> 03:11:02.44
Parts of your life that you can't remember was wild and

2111
03:11:02.44 --> 03:11:09.44
You know, but as with everything I tried to not only see both sides, but really think through it

2112
03:11:09.44 --> 03:11:22.44
And thankfully and eventually I just realized how wrong of a mindset that was and not only is it understandable that I don't remember anything

2113
03:11:22.44 --> 03:11:31.44
I just taken a grenade to the face but also I woke up and I'm still here

2114
03:11:31.44 --> 03:11:40.44
And I'm so thankful and grateful to be alive like who cares that I can't remember not that they would have taken my I witnessed statement anyway

2115
03:11:40.44 --> 03:11:50.44
Because you can't be injured and be an eyewitness just because the last mile of effect did your memory of things and so

2116
03:11:50.44 --> 03:11:55.44
Yeah, you know when when everything kind of started with the metal and I'm going for it a little bit

2117
03:11:55.44 --> 03:12:03.44
So we can backtrack but yeah, you know they called me up first phone call in the hospital and I just said I'm sorry

2118
03:12:03.44 --> 03:12:11.44
You know, I don't there's nothing that I remember that can help hurt assist in any way with this investigation

2119
03:12:11.44 --> 03:12:15.44
And chief foreign officer five's reads

2120
03:12:15.44 --> 03:12:25.44
He was assigned to to nine second to tiny night Marines just to spearhead this investigation

2121
03:12:25.44 --> 03:12:30.44
You know he thanked me from my honesty and he told me no matter what happens what this investigation turns up

2122
03:12:30.44 --> 03:12:38.44
That we're proud of you and the job your fellow Marines did and we're thankful for your service and that was really it

2123
03:12:38.44 --> 03:12:51.44
But yes, you're right it was weird and frustrating to have this happen and has so much

2124
03:12:51.44 --> 03:12:58.44
So many people so much time and effort going into these moments that

2125
03:12:58.44 --> 03:13:05.44
We're nothing but a dark abyss to me.

2126
03:13:05.44 --> 03:13:15.44
I was actually surprised at how much you did remember. I mean and because I mean this is devastating injuries

2127
03:13:15.44 --> 03:13:23.44
But you you you re-gained consciousness and memory pretty quickly. I'm going back to the book here. Here's doc

2128
03:13:23.44 --> 03:13:28.44
Blood was on every inch of my body my body on my arm was torn torn mangled a huge portion of my face

2129
03:13:28.44 --> 03:13:34.44
Was hanging off my skull and on to my shoulder which clearly had a trap and all embedded in it docatzy that I was struggling to breathe

2130
03:13:34.44 --> 03:13:38.44
So we started putting in airway and before they took me off the roof

2131
03:13:38.44 --> 03:13:43.44
He figured he could put Humpty dumpty back together again after they got me on the ground

2132
03:13:43.44 --> 03:13:53.44
But I had but he had a choice to make normally with a fractured face in oral fair and geal would be the way to go

2133
03:13:53.44 --> 03:13:58.44
But he did but I didn't have any jaw left to help create the airway

2134
03:13:58.44 --> 03:14:03.44
So he had only three choices he could cut my throat open with his pocket knife to create it in airway

2135
03:14:03.44 --> 03:14:09.44
Which is was even more terrifying than it sounds because he didn't have a mask or a bag to help me breathe

2136
03:14:09.44 --> 03:14:16.44
So he would have had to do the breathing for me through a rubber camel back tube from our hiking canteens

2137
03:14:16.44 --> 03:14:23.44
Or he could crack through my nose and down the back of my throat to create an artificial airway as I was choking on blood

2138
03:14:23.44 --> 03:14:27.44
But he didn't have a crack kid either or I could somehow figure out how to breathe on my own

2139
03:14:27.44 --> 03:14:35.44
But I was still choking so he realized he was going to have to improvise with that same pocket knife and camel back tube and rig up a crack

2140
03:14:35.44 --> 03:14:39.44
That wasn't the sort of thing they taught when he was preparing to be a medic

2141
03:14:39.44 --> 03:14:46.44
Presumably because they never anticipated a fire team would run into so many casualties in such a little time to exhaust their supplies

2142
03:14:46.44 --> 03:14:52.44
He put a device into my nose to support the tube and that sensation was the trigger that jerk me back to consciousness

2143
03:14:52.44 --> 03:14:54.44
And made me start coughing

2144
03:14:54.44 --> 03:14:56.44
Doc needed to lay me down to finish the procedure

2145
03:14:56.44 --> 03:14:59.44
But he was afraid of all my teeth fragments falling back into my throat

2146
03:14:59.44 --> 03:15:02.44
So he kept me sitting up right as he worked

2147
03:15:02.44 --> 03:15:05.44
I kept trying to talk but I only sounded like gurgling from

2148
03:15:05.44 --> 03:15:09.44
Gurgling water from all the blood and tissue blocking my throat

2149
03:15:09.44 --> 03:15:13.44
Even though they couldn't understand a word my attempt at speaking was a good thing

2150
03:15:13.44 --> 03:15:18.44
Because Doc saw that my body was somehow still functional enough to keep me breathing

2151
03:15:18.44 --> 03:15:21.44
So he decided not to risk the crack it after all

2152
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:25.44
As he pulled the plug from my nose a huge stream of mucus and blood came with it

2153
03:15:25.44 --> 03:15:29.44
And I suddenly began to take more to take an air more easily

2154
03:15:29.44 --> 03:15:34.44
So I mean I'm picturing this and it's like looking at you look now

2155
03:15:34.44 --> 03:15:39.44
You can tell you got dinged up but this is like catastrophic injuries

2156
03:15:39.44 --> 03:15:41.44
It's still

2157
03:15:41.44 --> 03:15:46.44
I mean borderline unreal to even still working on this for two years

2158
03:15:46.44 --> 03:15:49.44
Obviously knowing for nine years now what happened

2159
03:15:49.44 --> 03:15:52.44
Experiencing it myself

2160
03:15:52.44 --> 03:15:54.44
It's just

2161
03:15:54.44 --> 03:15:59.44
To still to surreal to kind of bring in that it not only happened

2162
03:15:59.44 --> 03:16:02.44
But that I did survive it and

2163
03:16:02.44 --> 03:16:07.44
You're right I haven't really thought of it that way before but it is amazing that

2164
03:16:07.44 --> 03:16:09.44
I can remember anything at all

2165
03:16:09.44 --> 03:16:11.44
But

2166
03:16:11.44 --> 03:16:17.44
And thankfully now again looking back

2167
03:16:17.44 --> 03:16:20.44
I'm thankful that

2168
03:16:20.44 --> 03:16:23.44
You know besides seeing

2169
03:16:23.44 --> 03:16:28.44
Whiten-grace static and my ears ringing and not being disoriented

2170
03:16:28.44 --> 03:16:30.44
Not knowing what happened

2171
03:16:30.44 --> 03:16:33.44
You know all of those stalls

2172
03:16:33.44 --> 03:16:36.44
We're only going on on my head

2173
03:16:36.44 --> 03:16:41.44
And all of that really happened in just a few seconds

2174
03:16:41.44 --> 03:16:46.44
And the most profound

2175
03:16:46.44 --> 03:16:50.44
Couple of things that I do remember

2176
03:16:50.44 --> 03:16:53.44
And at the time

2177
03:16:53.44 --> 03:16:56.44
It was just

2178
03:16:56.44 --> 03:17:00.44
Too heavy in my mind and with the blood loss

2179
03:17:00.44 --> 03:17:03.44
To even halfway process or comprehend

2180
03:17:03.44 --> 03:17:07.44
And it's crazy to think about and think back to what you thought

2181
03:17:07.44 --> 03:17:09.44
Or your final moments on this earth

2182
03:17:09.44 --> 03:17:13.44
But I'm so thankful that I did

2183
03:17:13.44 --> 03:17:15.44
Get knocked down so hard

2184
03:17:15.44 --> 03:17:18.44
That I did have those final moments

2185
03:17:18.44 --> 03:17:20.44
Where I truly thought that was it

2186
03:17:20.44 --> 03:17:24.44
After I put the pieces together

2187
03:17:24.44 --> 03:17:27.44
Okay, this isn't water

2188
03:17:27.44 --> 03:17:29.44
My buddies aren't messing with me

2189
03:17:29.44 --> 03:17:31.44
This is blood I'm bleeding out

2190
03:17:31.44 --> 03:17:34.44
I knew that from how I felt

2191
03:17:34.44 --> 03:17:38.44
The casualties I had unfortunately seen so far on that deployment

2192
03:17:38.44 --> 03:17:41.44
And just the basic medical training we get as Marines

2193
03:17:41.44 --> 03:17:46.44
Once I realized that it wasn't warm water and I was bleeding out

2194
03:17:46.44 --> 03:17:49.44
I used those last few seconds

2195
03:17:49.44 --> 03:17:51.44
I thought about my family

2196
03:17:51.44 --> 03:17:54.44
Specifically my mom again

2197
03:17:54.44 --> 03:17:57.44
And how devastated that she was going to be

2198
03:17:57.44 --> 03:18:00.44
That I did not survive to make it home

2199
03:18:00.44 --> 03:18:03.44
I said a quick prayer for forgiveness

2200
03:18:03.44 --> 03:18:05.44
And anything I had done wrong

2201
03:18:05.44 --> 03:18:10.44
And I faded from consciousness in the world

2202
03:18:10.44 --> 03:18:15.44
And I say that I'm thankful that I tasted death

2203
03:18:15.44 --> 03:18:17.44
And I went through that

2204
03:18:17.44 --> 03:18:19.44
What I thought was final moments

2205
03:18:19.44 --> 03:18:26.44
Because now I know and I can share with people

2206
03:18:26.44 --> 03:18:29.44
And it sounds kind of cliche

2207
03:18:29.44 --> 03:18:32.44
But just how truly

2208
03:18:32.44 --> 03:18:36.44
Vyneite and delicate

2209
03:18:36.44 --> 03:18:39.44
And beautiful life is

2210
03:18:39.44 --> 03:18:42.44
And I can tell people

2211
03:18:42.44 --> 03:18:47.44
Thinkfully that have not tasted those final moments

2212
03:18:47.44 --> 03:18:51.44
And have never had that reality check

2213
03:18:51.44 --> 03:18:53.44
Which is great

2214
03:18:53.44 --> 03:18:57.44
But I think a lot of times

2215
03:18:57.44 --> 03:19:03.44
We just again go back to that

2216
03:19:03.44 --> 03:19:06.44
Maybe the invincible conversation

2217
03:19:06.44 --> 03:19:09.44
And always thinking it's going to be someone else

2218
03:19:09.44 --> 03:19:11.44
That's it

2219
03:19:11.44 --> 03:19:13.44
We always do think it's going to be someone else

2220
03:19:13.44 --> 03:19:17.44
And so to remind people and give them that reality check

2221
03:19:17.44 --> 03:19:20.44
Hey, really think about

2222
03:19:20.44 --> 03:19:25.44
And really realize

2223
03:19:25.44 --> 03:19:30.44
That at any moment

2224
03:19:30.44 --> 03:19:35.44
In the military or as a civilian

2225
03:19:35.44 --> 03:19:38.44
With the terrorist attacks

2226
03:19:38.44 --> 03:19:42.44
With cars playing at any moment

2227
03:19:42.44 --> 03:19:44.44
You could be that someone else

2228
03:19:44.44 --> 03:19:46.44
Tasting those final moments

2229
03:19:46.44 --> 03:19:49.44
So before you get to those

2230
03:19:49.44 --> 03:19:53.44
Not only strive to be a good person

2231
03:19:53.44 --> 03:19:55.44
And live your life throughout way

2232
03:19:55.44 --> 03:19:57.44
And love and care about those around you

2233
03:19:57.44 --> 03:20:00.44
But for yourself

2234
03:20:00.44 --> 03:20:03.44
Don't get to those final moments

2235
03:20:03.44 --> 03:20:06.44
And wish that you have more time

2236
03:20:06.44 --> 03:20:08.44
Or wish that you had a few more seconds

2237
03:20:08.44 --> 03:20:13.44
Before the darkness closes in

2238
03:20:13.44 --> 03:20:16.44
And so it just gives me such a profound

2239
03:20:16.44 --> 03:20:19.44
Just appreciation for

2240
03:20:19.44 --> 03:20:22.44
Not only waking up after that

2241
03:20:22.44 --> 03:20:26.44
But you know being able to

2242
03:20:26.44 --> 03:20:28.44
Continue live my life

2243
03:20:28.44 --> 03:20:31.44
Knowing that it just makes it so much sweeter

2244
03:20:31.44 --> 03:20:33.44
But also

2245
03:20:33.44 --> 03:20:35.44
The downfall

2246
03:20:35.44 --> 03:20:37.44
And negative side is

2247
03:20:37.44 --> 03:20:41.44
Once you had tasted that

2248
03:20:41.44 --> 03:20:43.44
Or been around guys

2249
03:20:43.44 --> 03:20:47.44
And has seen those final moments in their eyes

2250
03:20:47.44 --> 03:20:51.44
And it heard those last breaths

2251
03:20:51.44 --> 03:20:55.44
You know I'm not scared of that now

2252
03:20:55.44 --> 03:20:57.44
And I don't

2253
03:20:57.44 --> 03:20:58.44
Dread it

2254
03:20:58.44 --> 03:21:01.44
I don't think anymore than I would have before

2255
03:21:01.44 --> 03:21:04.44
But just

2256
03:21:04.44 --> 03:21:07.44
Knowing and experiencing

2257
03:21:07.44 --> 03:21:10.44
That when those lights went out

2258
03:21:10.44 --> 03:21:13.44
Until I woke up five weeks later

2259
03:21:13.44 --> 03:21:14.44
They were out

2260
03:21:14.44 --> 03:21:16.44
And it wasn't

2261
03:21:16.44 --> 03:21:18.44
Even a darkness

2262
03:21:18.44 --> 03:21:20.44
It was

2263
03:21:20.44 --> 03:21:22.44
It was

2264
03:21:22.44 --> 03:21:24.44
A darkness of nothing

2265
03:21:27.44 --> 03:21:31.44
And so before you get to that darkness

2266
03:21:31.44 --> 03:21:35.44
Enjoy love and live your life

2267
03:21:35.44 --> 03:21:38.44
But waking up that's you know that is

2268
03:21:38.44 --> 03:21:40.44
Really what started

2269
03:21:40.44 --> 03:21:43.44
This new path and journey

2270
03:21:43.44 --> 03:21:45.44
Overcovering

2271
03:21:45.44 --> 03:21:47.44
And

2272
03:21:47.44 --> 03:21:49.44
Self discovery

2273
03:21:49.44 --> 03:21:52.44
I guess you could say

2274
03:21:52.44 --> 03:21:56.44
That I'm living now

2275
03:21:56.44 --> 03:22:01.44
There's a bunch of things that went down

2276
03:22:01.44 --> 03:22:04.44
As all this is happening

2277
03:22:04.44 --> 03:22:06.44
I mean for one

2278
03:22:06.44 --> 03:22:08.44
There happened to be two

2279
03:22:08.44 --> 03:22:10.44
Casivak birds that were nearby

2280
03:22:10.44 --> 03:22:12.44
That were there in a matter of

2281
03:22:12.44 --> 03:22:13.44
10, 15 minutes

2282
03:22:13.44 --> 03:22:16.44
12 minutes is what the actual number is

2283
03:22:16.44 --> 03:22:19.44
There was dock that was trying to give you a shot

2284
03:22:19.44 --> 03:22:21.44
A morphing to

2285
03:22:21.44 --> 03:22:23.44
To ease the pain

2286
03:22:23.44 --> 03:22:27.44
And as he's they had wrapped so much

2287
03:22:27.44 --> 03:22:29.44
Gauze around you to try and

2288
03:22:29.44 --> 03:22:31.44
Provent you from bleeding out

2289
03:22:31.44 --> 03:22:33.44
That as he's trying to give you a shot

2290
03:22:33.44 --> 03:22:35.44
A morphing the needle breaks and he can't give you

2291
03:22:35.44 --> 03:22:36.44
Any morphing

2292
03:22:36.44 --> 03:22:38.44
His last

2293
03:22:38.44 --> 03:22:39.44
More thing shot

2294
03:22:39.44 --> 03:22:41.44
Oh so he broke that one

2295
03:22:41.44 --> 03:22:43.44
If you had a one more he would have pulled out

2296
03:22:43.44 --> 03:22:44.44
Another one cleared some of the

2297
03:22:44.44 --> 03:22:45.44
Gauze away and given it to you

2298
03:22:45.44 --> 03:22:46.44
Correct

2299
03:22:46.44 --> 03:22:48.44
And they told me

2300
03:22:48.44 --> 03:22:51.44
After the fact after I woke up

2301
03:22:51.44 --> 03:22:54.44
That if I would have received a single drop

2302
03:22:54.44 --> 03:22:55.44
A more thin

2303
03:22:55.44 --> 03:22:58.44
It would have depressed my respiratory system

2304
03:22:58.44 --> 03:23:00.44
To the point of being

2305
03:23:00.44 --> 03:23:02.44
Unrecoverable to where they could not

2306
03:23:02.44 --> 03:23:03.44
Resuscitate me

2307
03:23:03.44 --> 03:23:05.44
And it was the combat gauze

2308
03:23:05.44 --> 03:23:07.44
That

2309
03:23:07.44 --> 03:23:08.44
They had that 12 minutes

2310
03:23:08.44 --> 03:23:10.44
And it was kind of like

2311
03:23:10.44 --> 03:23:12.44
Okay, we had the combat gauze

2312
03:23:12.44 --> 03:23:13.44
We have a couple minutes

2313
03:23:13.44 --> 03:23:15.44
Even though his legs are just

2314
03:23:15.44 --> 03:23:17.44
Minor tissue wounds

2315
03:23:17.44 --> 03:23:18.44
Compared to everything else

2316
03:23:18.44 --> 03:23:21.44
And I wasn't even bleeding out of my legs

2317
03:23:21.44 --> 03:23:23.44
And they were a little tore up

2318
03:23:23.44 --> 03:23:25.44
But I wasn't even bleeding out of my legs

2319
03:23:25.44 --> 03:23:28.44
Because I wasn't even bleeding out of the hole

2320
03:23:28.44 --> 03:23:29.44
And my carotid

2321
03:23:29.44 --> 03:23:31.44
Because my break-yall

2322
03:23:31.44 --> 03:23:33.44
Artary which had been blown open

2323
03:23:33.44 --> 03:23:35.44
Was putting out so much blood

2324
03:23:35.44 --> 03:23:36.44
And so

2325
03:23:36.44 --> 03:23:39.44
The needle caught the combat gauze

2326
03:23:39.44 --> 03:23:41.44
That was wrapped around my leg

2327
03:23:41.44 --> 03:23:42.44
Which was at the time

2328
03:23:42.44 --> 03:23:45.44
A paper cut compared to everything else

2329
03:23:45.44 --> 03:23:46.44
If that

2330
03:23:46.44 --> 03:23:48.44
And so that just

2331
03:23:48.44 --> 03:23:50.44
And I think you're getting into it

2332
03:23:50.44 --> 03:23:52.44
But just one of the few

2333
03:23:52.44 --> 03:23:55.44
Beginning of those dominoes of miracles

2334
03:23:55.44 --> 03:23:56.44
That

2335
03:23:56.44 --> 03:23:59.44
Allow me to be sitting right here with you

2336
03:23:59.44 --> 03:24:01.44
Yeah, you say this

2337
03:24:01.44 --> 03:24:03.44
There are two types of miracles

2338
03:24:03.44 --> 03:24:04.44
The first kind of miracles

2339
03:24:04.44 --> 03:24:05.44
One

2340
03:24:05.44 --> 03:24:07.44
When one amazing thing happens

2341
03:24:07.44 --> 03:24:09.44
And there's no explaining

2342
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:09.44
How or why

2343
03:24:09.44 --> 03:24:11.44
The second kind is when there are

2344
03:24:11.44 --> 03:24:14.44
There is a massive line of dominoes

2345
03:24:14.44 --> 03:24:16.44
Set up that all have to fall

2346
03:24:16.44 --> 03:24:17.44
Precisely right way

2347
03:24:17.44 --> 03:24:19.44
And at the right time

2348
03:24:19.44 --> 03:24:20.44
For something to work out

2349
03:24:20.44 --> 03:24:22.44
This piece of my life

2350
03:24:22.44 --> 03:24:24.44
Is the second kind of miracle

2351
03:24:24.44 --> 03:24:26.44
So number one

2352
03:24:26.44 --> 03:24:27.44
The

2353
03:24:27.44 --> 03:24:29.44
Casavac helicopter

2354
03:24:29.44 --> 03:24:31.44
Being in the area

2355
03:24:31.44 --> 03:24:32.44
They're there pick you up in

2356
03:24:32.44 --> 03:24:33.44
Twelve minutes

2357
03:24:33.44 --> 03:24:34.44
That's a miracle

2358
03:24:34.44 --> 03:24:35.44
A few days earlier

2359
03:24:35.44 --> 03:24:37.44
It had taken 50 minutes

2360
03:24:37.44 --> 03:24:38.44
Which there's no way you live in

2361
03:24:38.44 --> 03:24:39.44
Fifty minutes

2362
03:24:39.44 --> 03:24:42.44
Then you already talk about the

2363
03:24:42.44 --> 03:24:44.44
The morphine

2364
03:24:44.44 --> 03:24:46.44
If they'd given you that morphine

2365
03:24:46.44 --> 03:24:48.44
Or had one more morphine

2366
03:24:48.44 --> 03:24:50.44
To hit you with

2367
03:24:50.44 --> 03:24:52.44
Because the first one broke

2368
03:24:52.44 --> 03:24:53.44
You wouldn't survive

2369
03:24:53.44 --> 03:24:55.44
They would've killed you

2370
03:24:55.44 --> 03:24:57.44
And

2371
03:24:57.44 --> 03:24:58.44
And then

2372
03:24:58.44 --> 03:24:59.44
You have this

2373
03:24:59.44 --> 03:25:00.44
First I was phone to cap

2374
03:25:00.44 --> 03:25:01.44
But camp-assgent

2375
03:25:01.44 --> 03:25:02.44
Bastion

2376
03:25:02.44 --> 03:25:03.44
I was treated by

2377
03:25:03.44 --> 03:25:04.44
A

2378
03:25:04.44 --> 03:25:05.44
Armor

2379
03:25:05.44 --> 03:25:07.44
Army Forward surgical team

2380
03:25:07.44 --> 03:25:09.44
My official ruling upon arrival

2381
03:25:09.44 --> 03:25:10.44
Was E

2382
03:25:10.44 --> 03:25:12.44
Was P.E.A.

2383
03:25:12.44 --> 03:25:14.44
Policist Electrical

2384
03:25:14.44 --> 03:25:15.44
Activity

2385
03:25:15.44 --> 03:25:17.44
Meaning I had flatlined

2386
03:25:17.44 --> 03:25:18.44
But the medical staff there

2387
03:25:18.44 --> 03:25:19.44
Restarted my heart

2388
03:25:19.44 --> 03:25:21.44
And managed to stabilize me

2389
03:25:21.44 --> 03:25:23.44
Enough to send me on to can to heart

2390
03:25:23.44 --> 03:25:25.44
So

2391
03:25:25.44 --> 03:25:26.44
That's another

2392
03:25:26.44 --> 03:25:27.44
So you got your flatlined your dead

2393
03:25:27.44 --> 03:25:28.44
And they bring you back

2394
03:25:28.44 --> 03:25:29.44
And then the last one

2395
03:25:29.44 --> 03:25:30.44
One of the morning of November

2396
03:25:30.44 --> 03:25:31.44
Twenty-fourth

2397
03:25:31.44 --> 03:25:34.44
You flatlined again

2398
03:25:34.44 --> 03:25:36.44
And you got revived again

2399
03:25:36.44 --> 03:25:37.44
So

2400
03:25:37.44 --> 03:25:39.44
That's Miracle upon Miracle

2401
03:25:39.44 --> 03:25:42.44
That's your sitting here right now

2402
03:25:42.44 --> 03:25:44.44
And any

2403
03:25:44.44 --> 03:25:45.44
I mean what are the chances

2404
03:25:45.44 --> 03:25:47.44
That doc friend could have loaded

2405
03:25:47.44 --> 03:25:48.44
Two extra morphine in this back

2406
03:25:48.44 --> 03:25:49.44
Right?

2407
03:25:49.44 --> 03:25:51.44
I mean it's just

2408
03:25:51.44 --> 03:25:53.44
There's so many different ways

2409
03:25:53.44 --> 03:25:54.44
This could've gone

2410
03:25:54.44 --> 03:25:58.44
You get to launch tool

2411
03:25:58.44 --> 03:25:59.44
The nickname for launch tool

2412
03:25:59.44 --> 03:26:00.44
As halfway home

2413
03:26:00.44 --> 03:26:02.44
Because once wounded military members

2414
03:26:02.44 --> 03:26:03.44
They're

2415
03:26:03.44 --> 03:26:04.44
Make it there

2416
03:26:04.44 --> 03:26:05.44
Their chances of survival

2417
03:26:05.44 --> 03:26:08.44
And they're

2418
03:26:08.44 --> 03:26:10.44
Their chances of survival

2419
03:26:10.44 --> 03:26:11.44
Rized drastically

2420
03:26:11.44 --> 03:26:12.44
The fact that I had survived

2421
03:26:12.44 --> 03:26:13.44
Long enough to make it to long

2422
03:26:13.44 --> 03:26:15.44
Strule was a miracle

2423
03:26:15.44 --> 03:26:18.44
On Wednesday, November 24th

2424
03:26:18.44 --> 03:26:19.44
Master Sergeant

2425
03:26:19.44 --> 03:26:20.44
Chuck Williams

2426
03:26:20.44 --> 03:26:22.44
A chaplain's assistant from South Carolina

2427
03:26:22.44 --> 03:26:24.44
It was reviewing the list of

2428
03:26:24.44 --> 03:26:25.44
Chocks

2429
03:26:25.44 --> 03:26:26.44
Expected that day

2430
03:26:26.44 --> 03:26:28.44
That's folks that are coming in

2431
03:26:28.44 --> 03:26:29.44
He always checked for

2432
03:26:29.44 --> 03:26:31.44
Reservis and National Guard

2433
03:26:31.44 --> 03:26:32.44
Guard's men since he served

2434
03:26:32.44 --> 03:26:34.44
Through the South Carolina

2435
03:26:34.44 --> 03:26:35.44
Air National Guard

2436
03:26:35.44 --> 03:26:36.44
But that day he was also

2437
03:26:36.44 --> 03:26:38.44
Scenning the list for my name

2438
03:26:38.44 --> 03:26:40.44
He'd gotten a call

2439
03:26:40.44 --> 03:26:41.44
That there was a critically injured young man

2440
03:26:41.44 --> 03:26:42.44
From South Carolina

2441
03:26:42.44 --> 03:26:44.44
Arriving and he thought it might be nice for a

2442
03:26:44.44 --> 03:26:46.44
Marine to hear a familiar accent

2443
03:26:46.44 --> 03:26:48.44
Playing in his bedside table

2444
03:26:48.44 --> 03:26:50.44
Master Sergeant Williams had made

2445
03:26:50.44 --> 03:26:52.44
Sure that he was part of the group

2446
03:26:52.44 --> 03:26:53.44
Assigned to my flights arrival

2447
03:26:53.44 --> 03:26:55.44
And he was ready to move

2448
03:26:55.44 --> 03:26:56.44
The moment he heard my name

2449
03:26:56.44 --> 03:26:57.44
Called as I was unloaded

2450
03:26:57.44 --> 03:26:59.44
And rolled toward the door

2451
03:26:59.44 --> 03:27:01.44
Hello Kyle

2452
03:27:01.44 --> 03:27:02.44
I'm chaplain Williams

2453
03:27:02.44 --> 03:27:04.44
And I'm here to help you

2454
03:27:04.44 --> 03:27:06.44
With anything you need while you're here

2455
03:27:06.44 --> 03:27:07.44
Longstool

2456
03:27:07.44 --> 03:27:08.44
He said gently leaning down

2457
03:27:08.44 --> 03:27:09.44
Next to my face

2458
03:27:09.44 --> 03:27:11.44
Then he spoke a quick prayer for me

2459
03:27:11.44 --> 03:27:14.44
And I was whisked away into the operating room

2460
03:27:14.44 --> 03:27:16.44
The next morning he came into my room

2461
03:27:16.44 --> 03:27:17.44
To talk with me again

2462
03:27:17.44 --> 03:27:19.44
What the chaplain cork calls

2463
03:27:19.44 --> 03:27:21.44
Ministry of Presence

2464
03:27:21.44 --> 03:27:23.44
I wasn't awake and I couldn't ask

2465
03:27:23.44 --> 03:27:26.44
Many questions or seek his council on spiritual matters

2466
03:27:26.44 --> 03:27:28.44
But he thought he would sit with me

2467
03:27:28.44 --> 03:27:31.44
So that I was not alone as I fought for my life

2468
03:27:31.44 --> 03:27:35.44
I'd never heard that term before

2469
03:27:35.44 --> 03:27:36.44
Ministry of Presence

2470
03:27:36.44 --> 03:27:37.44
Neither

2471
03:27:37.44 --> 03:27:39.44
But that's just the image

2472
03:27:39.44 --> 03:27:41.44
Alone of that

2473
03:27:41.44 --> 03:27:42.44
It's amazing

2474
03:27:42.44 --> 03:27:44.44
It's powerful

2475
03:27:44.44 --> 03:27:47.44
And you know

2476
03:27:47.44 --> 03:27:50.44
Again I hate to not do this book justice

2477
03:27:50.44 --> 03:27:52.44
I mean I can already tell you

2478
03:27:52.44 --> 03:27:55.44
I just skip the entire notification process

2479
03:27:55.44 --> 03:27:56.44
For your parents

2480
03:27:56.44 --> 03:27:58.44
Which is a book in its own right

2481
03:27:58.44 --> 03:28:00.44
As a matter of fact I just did a podcast

2482
03:28:00.44 --> 03:28:03.44
On a book called Knock at the door

2483
03:28:03.44 --> 03:28:04.44
The Knock at the door

2484
03:28:04.44 --> 03:28:05.44
Yeah, Ryan Manning

2485
03:28:05.44 --> 03:28:06.44
Yeah

2486
03:28:06.44 --> 03:28:07.44
And

2487
03:28:07.44 --> 03:28:08.44
Amazing family

2488
03:28:08.44 --> 03:28:09.44
I mean that's one of the reasons I said

2489
03:28:09.44 --> 03:28:10.44
You know what

2490
03:28:10.44 --> 03:28:11.44
With Kyle I'm gonna like

2491
03:28:11.44 --> 03:28:13.44
Not go and deple on that part

2492
03:28:13.44 --> 03:28:15.44
But you do a great job of explaining

2493
03:28:15.44 --> 03:28:17.44
What that was like explaining the the

2494
03:28:17.44 --> 03:28:18.44
Unknown

2495
03:28:18.44 --> 03:28:19.44
And the

2496
03:28:19.44 --> 03:28:20.44
And the

2497
03:28:20.44 --> 03:28:21.44
Just the

2498
03:28:21.44 --> 03:28:24.44
Complete sorrow and fear

2499
03:28:24.44 --> 03:28:26.44
And the emotions that they're going through

2500
03:28:26.44 --> 03:28:28.44
I mean it's just

2501
03:28:28.44 --> 03:28:32.44
Again you got to get this book to to get all that

2502
03:28:32.44 --> 03:28:36.44
You talk about the surgeons physicians

2503
03:28:36.44 --> 03:28:39.44
The nurses I mean they are all just doing incredible work

2504
03:28:39.44 --> 03:28:41.44
And you go you go into awesome

2505
03:28:41.44 --> 03:28:43.44
Detail

2506
03:28:43.44 --> 03:28:45.44
You're getting surgeries on your skull

2507
03:28:45.44 --> 03:28:47.44
Your face

2508
03:28:47.44 --> 03:28:48.44
Your jaw

2509
03:28:48.44 --> 03:28:50.44
And this this shocked me

2510
03:28:50.44 --> 03:28:53.44
On Sunday November 28th I was clear to head home

2511
03:28:53.44 --> 03:28:56.44
As it turned out however mine was not a typical flight

2512
03:28:56.44 --> 03:28:58.44
There was an army sniper on board named Ryan Craig

2513
03:28:58.44 --> 03:29:00.44
Who's mother Jennifer Miller was a nurse

2514
03:29:00.44 --> 03:29:02.44
Ryan had taken a bullet to the head in a fire fight

2515
03:29:02.44 --> 03:29:06.44
And his chances of survival had been even lower than mine

2516
03:29:06.44 --> 03:29:09.44
Jennifer had received the dreaded invitation

2517
03:29:09.44 --> 03:29:12.44
From the military to come over to Germany to say goodbye

2518
03:29:12.44 --> 03:29:13.44
To where some of the people were going to

2519
03:29:13.44 --> 03:29:16.44
And they were going to be a

2520
03:29:16.44 --> 03:29:16.44
And they were going to be a

2521
03:29:16.44 --> 03:29:16.44
And they were going to be a

2522
03:29:16.44 --> 03:29:18.44
And they were going to be a

2523
03:29:18.44 --> 03:29:20.44
And they were going to be a

2524
03:29:20.44 --> 03:29:22.44
And they were going to be a

2525
03:29:22.44 --> 03:29:24.44
And they were going to be a

2526
03:29:24.44 --> 03:29:26.44
And they were going to be a

2527
03:29:26.44 --> 03:29:28.44
We were only one person

2528
03:29:28.44 --> 03:29:31.24
And they were going to be a

2529
03:29:31.24 --> 03:29:32.44
But by the time she arrived

2530
03:29:32.44 --> 03:29:34.44
His condition had begun to improve

2531
03:29:34.44 --> 03:29:36.44
And suddenly they look like he was going to survive

2532
03:29:36.44 --> 03:29:38.44
After all like me Ryan was still unconscious

2533
03:29:38.44 --> 03:29:40.44
But he too had been cleared to fly back home

2534
03:29:40.44 --> 03:29:41.44
And she settled in and next

2535
03:29:41.44 --> 03:29:43.44
To him for the trip Jennifer heard me

2536
03:29:43.44 --> 03:29:45.44
Start to make a sound

2537
03:29:45.44 --> 03:29:48.44
My bed was right next to Ryan's

2538
03:29:48.44 --> 03:29:48.44
And as she listened she realized I was saying

2539
03:29:48.44 --> 03:29:49.44
Mom

2540
03:29:49.44 --> 03:29:51.44
She knew immediately what she had to do

2541
03:29:51.44 --> 03:29:53.44
What any mother would do

2542
03:29:53.44 --> 03:29:57.82
right between us and with one hand reached out to her son and with the other

2543
03:29:57.82 --> 03:30:04.44
reached out to me. She held his hand and my hand the entire eight-hour flight.

2544
03:30:09.44 --> 03:30:11.44
Man.

2545
03:30:13.68 --> 03:30:19.44
Yeah, you know you talk a lot in here as well about these like responses that you give to hearing voice.

2546
03:30:19.44 --> 03:30:23.24
I mean, you're not conscious, but you respond. You're vitals peak, you know, so

2547
03:30:23.24 --> 03:30:29.24
like a little thing like that is having real impact. You know, it's like when you read about

2548
03:30:29.24 --> 03:30:35.24
you read about little kids that are abandoned and what what messes them up they figured us out in the

2549
03:30:35.24 --> 03:30:39.24
Russia. I think I read an article about like when they have a bunch of babies that have been abandoned and they're little.

2550
03:30:39.24 --> 03:30:48.24
And they don't have any human contact. They become they have real problems. So just that human touch is a real thing that has impact.

2551
03:30:48.24 --> 03:30:55.24
And here is this story of this mother who's doing everything to help her son and she sees you.

2552
03:30:55.24 --> 03:31:00.24
And it's like she knows instinctively that that human contact can make a difference.

2553
03:31:04.24 --> 03:31:06.24
Again, jumping ahead.

2554
03:31:07.24 --> 03:31:09.24
You're at Bethesda.

2555
03:31:09.24 --> 03:31:14.24
By the end of the first week of Bethesda, I was apparently awake and alert. I would follow people with my eye and

2556
03:31:14.24 --> 03:31:19.24
blink and not in response to questions, but I was not yet talking other than some groans and an

2557
03:31:19.24 --> 03:31:24.24
incoherent mumbling. My first memory is from about a week after that when I opened my eye and saw

2558
03:31:24.24 --> 03:31:30.24
hospital equipment. It was weird because the last thing I could recall clearly was being on that roof rooftop in Afghanistan.

2559
03:31:30.24 --> 03:31:35.24
I was definitely disoriented now, but in my confusion, I just rolled with it.

2560
03:31:35.24 --> 03:31:41.24
Gradually a seated figure next to me came into focus and I managed to croak out the words.

2561
03:31:41.24 --> 03:31:50.24
Hey dad. I'm not going to lie. It was difficult as I slowly became cognizant of the extent of my injuries.

2562
03:31:50.24 --> 03:31:55.24
I think it was difficult for my parents to watch too as I gradually started to realize one thing after

2563
03:31:55.24 --> 03:32:00.24
another. Each time I emerge back into consciousness, I've lost an eye. I've woken up with no teeth.

2564
03:32:00.24 --> 03:32:08.24
I can't feel my face. I can't lift my arm. My arms. But once reality sunk in, I didn't enter any kind of deep morning

2565
03:32:08.24 --> 03:32:15.24
period for my body or my old life, at least not yet. The more cognizant I became of the extent of my injuries,

2566
03:32:15.24 --> 03:32:19.24
the more I'd realized what a miracle it was that I was alive at all.

2567
03:32:19.24 --> 03:32:25.24
Maybe my tendency to compete with myself kicked in right away. Maybe my mom was right.

2568
03:32:25.24 --> 03:32:32.24
And she really was willing me to live. Whatever the case, my focus switched from the injuries that were out of my control.

2569
03:32:32.24 --> 03:32:41.24
To whatever recovery rehab I could do to maximize the facilities I still had. I don't think people believed at first that my positive perspective was genuine.

2570
03:32:41.24 --> 03:32:45.24
I'm pretty sure my family and nurses thought I was in denial. We're not fully lucid.

2571
03:32:45.24 --> 03:32:52.24
But I was driven by three things. The first was the simple fact that I couldn't undo my injuries.

2572
03:32:52.24 --> 03:32:59.24
Second I had a desire to be strong for everyone around me who is clearly struggling with how to learn how to support me.

2573
03:32:59.24 --> 03:33:05.24
I was motivated to not let my injuries and by extension the Taliban have any power over me.

2574
03:33:05.24 --> 03:33:14.24
For the sake of every Marine who had gone before me and those still fighting.

2575
03:33:14.24 --> 03:33:23.24
Yeah, how long did it take that transition from when you were like each time, how long you'd be awake for 15, 20 minutes and go,

2576
03:33:23.24 --> 03:33:32.24
hey, I only have one eye and then you're out for another day and then you wake up and go, I'd like to itch my face, but I can't move my arms.

2577
03:33:32.24 --> 03:33:38.24
The crazy thing is at first, I didn't know that my right ear drum was completely blown.

2578
03:33:38.24 --> 03:33:41.24
I didn't know that I only have one eye left.

2579
03:33:41.24 --> 03:33:52.24
I think because of the disorientation, the medication they give you this medicine called atropine and I forget exactly what it does.

2580
03:33:52.24 --> 03:33:56.24
But one of the side effects is it dilates your pupils really bad.

2581
03:33:56.24 --> 03:34:04.24
And so everything was kind of blurry already and it was just everything was just so strange.

2582
03:34:04.24 --> 03:34:12.24
And again, going way back, not only that, not only was my injuries, the medication, where I was at.

2583
03:34:12.24 --> 03:34:22.24
Those, you know, I faded from consciousness and we're all on a hot dusty rooftop on the other side of the world. Now there's snow building outside at my hospital room window pane.

2584
03:34:22.24 --> 03:34:31.24
I didn't even know there were military hospitals and everyone, you know, you always see your whole life.

2585
03:34:31.24 --> 03:34:35.24
Doctors in white lab coats.

2586
03:34:35.24 --> 03:34:45.24
Now my doctors were in camouflage and just all of those things, it was like, you know, what is going on.

2587
03:34:45.24 --> 03:34:50.24
But yes, I knew I was alive, that was the main thing.

2588
03:34:50.24 --> 03:35:00.24
You know, a lot of times when I woke up in the beginning, it was very short bursts of being awake.

2589
03:35:00.24 --> 03:35:23.24
And those short bursts were either full of pain, full of confusion or full of, I think I would just had so much, not an idea of what was going on.

2590
03:35:23.24 --> 03:35:39.24
Again, I just kind of rolled with it until thankful you know, I started to comprehend more. But, you know, for me to say, hey, dad, that was one of the most profound moments of my recovery for my parents and my family.

2591
03:35:39.24 --> 03:35:52.24
Because they had the mindset we say talk about now that anything physical, missing limbs, missing eyes, we can get through that. We can get better, we can love and heal you.

2592
03:35:52.24 --> 03:36:08.24
But, the brain is a beautiful, but delicate thing. And if you weren't calling more or if you didn't know we were, that would have been an entirely different area of

2593
03:36:08.24 --> 03:36:12.24
how do we cope with this?

2594
03:36:12.24 --> 03:36:22.24
So you got all that going on. And then this happens. I'm lying in bed. My heart races as I try to process how they got me into the hospital.

2595
03:36:22.24 --> 03:36:32.24
I am fixated on what used to be this silver sprinkler heads that are mounted in the ceiling. Now they are bullet holes. They've been shot out by the Taliban who've been taking over the hospital.

2596
03:36:32.24 --> 03:36:43.24
And now now in the room above mine unloading AK47 rounds down into my room. I can't move as my mom stays at my bedside with me. She gets shot in the leg.

2597
03:36:43.24 --> 03:36:52.24
And I've never felt so helpless. The shooting suddenly stopped. Seconds later, the silence is interrupted by the dreaded clinking of a hand grenade bouncing on the hospital room floor.

2598
03:36:52.24 --> 03:37:04.24
And the Taliban dropped it down through one of the holes in the roof and it lands at the foot of my bed. I hear the nurse scream, no! He's been through enough already. She jumps on it.

2599
03:37:04.24 --> 03:37:13.24
I watched the pink mist and body parts that are the only things left of her float around my room.

2600
03:37:13.24 --> 03:37:21.24
And what these are, these are hallucinations that you're having. And they are 100% real to you.

2601
03:37:21.24 --> 03:37:26.24
As real as us sitting here right now.

2602
03:37:26.24 --> 03:37:35.24
Going on my parents told me later that night was the worst of their life. Even worse than getting the call that I'd been injured or seeing my mangled body when I arrived.

2603
03:37:35.24 --> 03:37:42.24
Up to that point, I'd still been Kyle, just physically battered Kyle. They had no idea who this hallucinating person was.

2604
03:37:42.24 --> 03:37:53.24
And I was so far gone to whatever my mind had taken me. They were afraid that they would not be able to get me back.

2605
03:37:53.24 --> 03:38:09.24
I was returning to the ICU early the next morning. And then my dad, Franick, that our family, can't afford the medical bills, loads himself down with weapons and storms and the emergency room to demand that I get the surgeries I need and to reverse the hospitals order to discharge me.

2606
03:38:09.24 --> 03:38:17.24
I try to scream and beg him not to. I want to tell him it's okay and he doesn't have to do this even if I can get even if I can't get any more care.

2607
03:38:17.24 --> 03:38:25.24
As the second set of the ICU sliding doors open, he is met by a swap team who unload on him until I see him fall behind the nurse's station.

2608
03:38:25.24 --> 03:38:41.24
The last thing I remember is the sound of the shotgun my dad was holding as it hits the ground. I think about how much he must have loved me to do something like that.

2609
03:38:41.24 --> 03:38:52.24
And then this I am standing on the top of a small hill looking down and across a field watching a funeral. The sky is so great it seems more light than dark, more dark than light.

2610
03:38:52.24 --> 03:39:04.24
There are no tombstones not even at the gravesite of the person being buried. The only person in attendance is the pastor who is holding the Bible and standing at the head of the grave. I begin to wonder why I'm here standing on this hill by myself.

2611
03:39:04.24 --> 03:39:14.24
As the pastor begins to speak, I realize the horrifying answer to my question. I am watching my own funeral and no one has come.

2612
03:39:14.24 --> 03:39:24.24
The Marines I had called my brothers were so disappointed that I left them behind in Afghanistan that they didn't come to say goodbye.

2613
03:39:24.24 --> 03:39:38.24
I tried to yell out but I can't. I tried to take a step but I can't. I am paralyzed with despair as tears rolled down my face.

2614
03:39:38.24 --> 03:39:48.24
Then you say the hallucinations were intense at no point did it ever occurred to me that the things I was seeing, hearing and feeling like might all be in my head.

2615
03:39:48.24 --> 03:40:04.24
Every detail was so vivid and lifelike to this day they are forever locked in my brain not as memories of hallucinations I had but as memories of real events I experienced.

2616
03:40:04.24 --> 03:40:10.24
How long did that period last?

2617
03:40:10.24 --> 03:40:14.24
I seemed to like months but I think it was only a few hours.

2618
03:40:14.24 --> 03:40:18.24
And that was the reactions to a drug that they were giving you.

2619
03:40:18.24 --> 03:40:27.24
Correct. And you know early on especially during my time around this time that we're talking about and I see you.

2620
03:40:27.24 --> 03:40:47.24
I mean I was in surgery minimum every other day going through 13 hour surgeries to save my arm going through multiple, you know, every time you put someone to sleep as a risk.

2621
03:40:47.24 --> 03:41:01.24
So every other day they might have put me to sleep one time but they would do three or four operations and every other day if not every day.

2622
03:41:01.24 --> 03:41:20.24
When the warriors at Walter Reed myself included had to go to daily every other day what's called washouts and as you know the bacteria and things that we don't quite understand have it researched enough yet.

2623
03:41:20.24 --> 03:41:35.24
In the soil in Afghanistan create infections that can be just as deadly if not more deadly than the actual injury and can kill you weeks later at Walter Reed.

2624
03:41:35.24 --> 03:41:40.24
So I haven't go in for these washouts multiple operations every time I was put down.

2625
03:41:40.24 --> 03:41:55.24
So I think just all of that combined along with already struggling to grasp this new reality that I was waking up to and experiencing.

2626
03:41:55.24 --> 03:42:10.24
But and that last hallucination you read about about watch your mouth funeral is the only thing out of my entire journey that still.

2627
03:42:10.24 --> 03:42:29.24
Chokes me up because it was just a feeling of beyond despair. I couldn't move. I was so frozen with despair and.

2628
03:42:29.24 --> 03:42:40.24
I was just so devastated that not just my buddies but no one no family, nothing.

2629
03:42:40.24 --> 03:42:59.24
Massive rolling hills worth of a field was just a hole in the ground where I was and that religious leader conducting the funeral. But like with so many pieces and parts of my journey.

2630
03:42:59.24 --> 03:43:19.24
I'm thankful that that hallucination occurred because that taught me want to help me realize one of the most powerful lessons and questions that I can continue to carry with myself today and always ask and remind myself and that is.

2631
03:43:19.24 --> 03:43:40.24
And we just are me. This is what I translated from that. But what is my legacy and when I get to those final days which will be followed by my funeral.

2632
03:43:40.24 --> 03:43:55.24
Hopefully, or people come. But you know who will I have there. How many people will I have helped love touched impacted.

2633
03:43:55.24 --> 03:44:21.24
What am I doing every day and and how am I living to create a funeral that has people there has more people than less. And you know, I think it was also scary and I never really thought about this until right now, but I think it was also scary because the other hallucinations.

2634
03:44:21.24 --> 03:44:28.24
I think maybe 1% of my brain.

2635
03:44:28.24 --> 03:44:45.24
You know, at least after the first hallucination continuing to have more. Yes, they seemed completely real. And I felt like I was completely loosened.

2636
03:44:45.24 --> 03:45:01.24
But after going through multiple hallucinations that were just so crazy. I mean, giant spiders attacking a hospital room, the Taliban dropping grenades, my dad, you know, charging the emergency room.

2637
03:45:01.24 --> 03:45:08.24
They were not kind of normal life experiences.

2638
03:45:08.24 --> 03:45:21.24
So when I entered that hallucination of watching my own funeral, then it became mixed with, okay, this actually does relate to what's going on.

2639
03:45:21.24 --> 03:45:34.24
Like that that I finally succumb to the fight and actually, you know, is this really, really happening, you know, because

2640
03:45:34.24 --> 03:45:44.24
last time I remember before this hallucination started, I was struggling to hang on to life.

2641
03:45:44.24 --> 03:45:50.24
So it was kind of like a plausible scenario.

2642
03:45:50.24 --> 03:46:18.24
But yeah, you know, that was a course I know today. It wasn't real. It's not true, but it still, you know, cuts into me to feel like I disappointed those around me and I disappointed them to the extent that they didn't care about me anymore.

2643
03:46:18.24 --> 03:46:25.24
And that they were upset with me for leaving the deployment early. Am I on family didn't come?

2644
03:46:25.24 --> 03:46:34.24
And I don't remember exactly, but I think in that moment and that hallucination I was thinking, well, you know, they didn't come because of the hardships I put on through.

2645
03:46:34.24 --> 03:46:52.24
And so that was extremely tough, but again, has made me from that day on, think about, you know, when that time from my funeral comes, what legacy am I leaving?

2646
03:46:52.24 --> 03:47:12.24
Yeah, and it's interesting that it's framed up what the most important thing to you is everyone else, like who's who have I helped, who have I given enough to that they that they want to come and give a little bit back to me right now.

2647
03:47:12.24 --> 03:47:28.24
You're getting back to your, you're attitude a little bit here, which is just, you know, important for anybody to hear your Nick had woken up because Nick, you know, he suffered bad injury to.

2648
03:47:28.24 --> 03:47:40.24
And you say this, I was thrilled when I learned Nick had woken up for a variety of reasons. I only saw Nick a couple of times in the hospital, but I've made my day when he penned a was up Kyle on his whiteboard when he was doing occupational therapy for writing.

2649
03:47:40.24 --> 03:47:49.24
We were just a few rooms a poor apart, but still, bedridden, so we started sending a whiteboard back and forth with short messages we practiced writing to each other.

2650
03:47:49.24 --> 03:48:03.24
And as you see, it was encouraging to me to see that Nick was on the same journey I was. We were reclaiming our lives and learning how to be our fullest selves, not in spite of our injuries, but because of them.

2651
03:48:03.24 --> 03:48:18.24
Our injuries happened nothing would ever change that our wounds were part of our bodies, but we were the ones who would get to choose what role they would play in our stories.

2652
03:48:18.24 --> 03:48:33.24
Awesome statement, and it's a, what's awesome of to me about that statement is how often do people let things that are much less significant, infinitely less significant than the injuries that you received and the injuries that Nick received.

2653
03:48:33.24 --> 03:48:50.24
And yet they let those things, those little insignificant things dictate their whole life, dictate their reaction, dictate the way they're going to behave. And here you were looking at these catastrophic injuries saying you get to choose what role those injuries play in your life.

2654
03:48:50.24 --> 03:48:54.24
So that's an attitude to think about, for sure.

2655
03:48:54.24 --> 03:49:14.24
Everything is a choice. Everything is, is not only a choice, but everything is shaped by the lens of perspective that you choose to look through.

2656
03:49:14.24 --> 03:49:27.24
I'm trying to kind of conjure up where you found that lens, because there's plenty of people I'm saying that could use to who to want to borrow those glasses from you to have a look through that lens at their world.

2657
03:49:27.24 --> 03:49:41.24
And I think, you know, I always think that there's things that can help people that all they need is awareness, right? Like all they need is to see it.

2658
03:49:41.24 --> 03:49:56.24
So I think even hearing you say, look, how you look at it, hearing you say that. People go, maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. So if you're in a tough spot right now out there in the world.

2659
03:49:56.24 --> 03:50:12.24
This is your not in his tough as a spot as you were in as Nick was in. And how can you adjust your perception a little bit so that you see it in a different light see your situation in a different light?

2660
03:50:12.24 --> 03:50:25.24
Absolutely. And I think it's important to note that struggle, adversity, all of these life obstacles that get in our way that not just down.

2661
03:50:25.24 --> 03:50:43.24
Those things are the last things we should ever compare. But exactly what you're saying to have a frame of reference of, you know, wow.

2662
03:50:43.24 --> 03:51:03.24
I can't get through this. And I, and this is one of the reasons I wrote the book to tell people that you can come back better and stronger might be physically mentally and emotionally different or emotionally different.

2663
03:51:03.24 --> 03:51:15.24
And that is absolutely okay. We all handle adversity differently. We all heal on our own time. But you truly can come back better and stronger than you were before whatever not you down.

2664
03:51:15.24 --> 03:51:28.24
And in good time, you can not only come back better and stronger, but you can do it with a smile on your face.

2665
03:51:28.24 --> 03:51:38.24
Just to kind of point out some of the what we're talking about for a struggle, you, you end up going home for rehab for some of your rehab, which was great.

2666
03:51:38.24 --> 03:51:48.24
But like you, you go into like a full celebration mode after you finally are able to put on a pair of socks for the first time.

2667
03:51:48.24 --> 03:51:54.24
And by the way, it took you like 10 minutes per sock to get the socks on. So, and eight months.

2668
03:51:54.24 --> 03:52:02.24
And eight months of work to get there. So, eight months of failing to put your socks on.

2669
03:52:02.24 --> 03:52:08.24
I don't want my mom brush my teeth. You know, before that getting ready, the few teeth I had left.

2670
03:52:08.24 --> 03:52:16.24
So, yeah, I mean, it still sounds crazy to say it to me. Eight months to be able to put my socks back.

2671
03:52:16.24 --> 03:52:23.24
You know, sometimes people look at a challenging situation, you know, and they say, well, it's going to take me a long time to get this done.

2672
03:52:23.24 --> 03:52:31.24
And whatever that thing that they're going to get done is going to be a pretty giant triumph, whether it's completing a marathon or completing some courses at school.

2673
03:52:31.24 --> 03:52:35.24
And here you are grinding as hard as you can.

2674
03:52:35.24 --> 03:52:46.24
And it takes you eight months and your reward is it only took you 10 minutes per sock, but you were able to put your own socks on.

2675
03:52:46.24 --> 03:52:55.24
You say, I knew I was reclaiming my body and my life one tiny muscle twitch at a time.

2676
03:52:55.24 --> 03:53:09.24
Yeah, that right there again. What is what, you know, if you're listening to this right now and you think you got some challenges, hey, you probably do. We all have challenges.

2677
03:53:09.24 --> 03:53:17.24
But if you can make that little, that little bit of progress, that little tiny bit of progress, and you do it today, you do tomorrow and you do it the next day.

2678
03:53:17.24 --> 03:53:24.24
You will dig yourself out of where you're at.

2679
03:53:24.24 --> 03:53:32.24
You say this and you say this, I get mad because I can't just read this entire book to everyone right now, but that's where they can buy it.

2680
03:53:32.24 --> 03:53:35.24
And actually, you read the audio book too.

2681
03:53:35.24 --> 03:53:37.24
Yeah, so that's really, that's really crazy.

2682
03:53:37.24 --> 03:53:46.24
Yeah, so a lot of times books are read by some random actor and and they say like,

2683
03:53:46.24 --> 03:53:52.24
Here, this part says, I know characters are the unsung heroes, but they read it like this.

2684
03:53:52.24 --> 03:53:59.24
I know caretakers are the unsung heroes. So you didn't do that. You read it yourself, which is awesome.

2685
03:53:59.24 --> 03:54:12.24
And you're in this section, you're just talking about everything that they did for you day in day out tasks of keeping someone comfortable taking them to the bathroom, remembering their pill schedule, accommodating their diet, helping them to get dressed,

2686
03:54:12.24 --> 03:54:16.24
keeping them company, cheering them up, celebrating the good days, walking them through their bad days.

2687
03:54:16.24 --> 03:54:22.24
I can't imagine how exhausting it must be to find yourself in a full time around the clock job of taking care of someone else.

2688
03:54:22.24 --> 03:54:35.24
And yet this was the role that various people took on for me. It was this strength and support when I still when I was at my worst and most broken physically that enabled me to begin to rebuild a normal life.

2689
03:54:35.24 --> 03:54:50.24
So again, shout out to the caretakers that people that got you through this just incredible people.

2690
03:54:50.24 --> 03:55:02.24
Continuing on here, I wasn't just physically exhausted. I was emotionally drained from the moment I regained consciousness back in December. I'd been putting a strong face on for my family. I thought if I could reassure them. I was okay.

2691
03:55:02.24 --> 03:55:16.24
Be easier for them to deal with what happened to me. I am a marine, which means the instinct to protect others is second nature nature. And that instinct was working over time now.

2692
03:55:16.24 --> 03:55:28.24
It was more than the endless, hospital trips and surgeries and skin grafts and adaptive exercises. It was getting used to the constant pain and the feeling of the shrapnel still trapped in my body.

2693
03:55:28.24 --> 03:55:38.24
From when I could see with my remaining eye, the world looked much the same. My mom and dad looked exactly like they looked before I'd shipped out. My brothers were taller, but otherwise the same boys I'd known.

2694
03:55:38.24 --> 03:55:57.24
But I knew what they saw, what they saw was forever changed. Every time they looked at me, they couldn't help but see my wounds. I had been the one to enlist, but now my family was serving alongside me.

2695
03:55:57.24 --> 03:56:08.24
It's so easy to breeze through the A, what your family is going through. B, what you're going through.

2696
03:56:08.24 --> 03:56:23.24
When I get an injury, I'm the scariest, pathetic person I'm so embarrassing. I get frustrated if I get caught on my finger and I can't train you to it.

2697
03:56:23.24 --> 03:56:33.24
And when you think about this level of injuries that you suffered, it's just, it's hard to comprehend.

2698
03:56:33.24 --> 03:56:46.24
And something you said earlier, there was a guy on here a few weeks ago named Jim Serlesley and he was a used Vietnam.

2699
03:56:46.24 --> 03:57:03.24
Awesome guy went to Vietnam, he was on his 11th month of his torn Vietnam and he was checking the perimeter of where his element was set up and he stepped on a mind and it took off both of his legs and one of his arms.

2700
03:57:03.24 --> 03:57:22.24
And they took like high above way above the knee, more like at the hip. But one thing that he said that I was thinking about it wasn't on the podcast, but we were talking about it later is like the 100%

2701
03:57:22.24 --> 03:57:33.24
Like this is this is what happened. This is like the 100% acceptance he said made a big difference in his life because he was with a lot of vets.

2702
03:57:33.24 --> 03:57:46.24
He talked about some of those other vets with me that he was with that never accepted what had happened to them. And no, it reminds me two things. It's like number one, you say, hey, I accepted that I couldn't change what had happened.

2703
03:57:46.24 --> 03:58:07.24
But also because he told me he said, you know, some of the guys that knew they only accepted it 95% and reminds me what you said when you're talking about those hallucinations and some of those weren't as bad because you even though you were 99% sure that little 1% was enough to make a difference in your brain.

2704
03:58:07.24 --> 03:58:20.24
And I think that's what happens with our life. Like we have to accept, okay, these things happen in the past and there's not anything you can do to change what's happened in the past. It is impossible.

2705
03:58:20.24 --> 03:58:44.24
It's the most obvious piece of the whole puzzle. It is the past. We know we can change it. We know we can't alter it, fix it, go back. But it is one of the most detrimental aspects potentially of a recovery of a struggle.

2706
03:58:44.24 --> 03:58:56.24
The what is that daunting question that most of the time will never be answered. And the main thing, a lot of the times that people get hung up on.

2707
03:58:56.24 --> 03:59:10.24
But the most obvious and so I'm thankful that I did, we the past and the past and I left it 100% behind me.

2708
03:59:10.24 --> 03:59:28.24
But in order to realize that I had to hit rock bottom, arguably the lowest point in my life by far the lowest point of my recovery.

2709
03:59:28.24 --> 03:59:49.24
As you already said, I had gone home to recover roughly six or seven months. I had been injured November 2010. I was in my first three kind of initial life saving months of my recovery until the last week of February 2011.

2710
03:59:49.24 --> 04:00:05.24
At the time, there was such an influx of casualties, not only from my rack, but now from the push and Afghanistan. I remember just stopping in my tracks at Walter Reed.

2711
04:00:05.24 --> 04:00:19.24
I went up on to the recovery floor and I think I was going to visit some guys because this was after I had already got back on my feet become stable.

2712
04:00:19.24 --> 04:00:30.24
But I remember stopping in my tracks at the site of hospital beds being put in the hallway because Walter Reed had run out of space in rooms.

2713
04:00:30.24 --> 04:00:43.24
The recovery room was doubled up on patients. Initially after I got injured, I was the only one on the whole floor because of how delicate my condition was that did not have a roommate.

2714
04:00:43.24 --> 04:01:12.24
Because I needed two corpsmen or army medics in there every second of the day on what's called a one to one to just sit there for hours and hours day after day watching me watching my machines so that if I crash, if I flatlined, you know, am I only save five to ten seconds, but someone not only being there, but they could immediately contact doctors and people that could help.

2715
04:01:12.24 --> 04:01:15.24
People that could help bring me back.

2716
04:01:15.24 --> 04:01:33.24
So what that said, we had already been told and I had already unfortunately heard the extremely heavy news that minimum, I was going to have to spend two years at Walter Reed.

2717
04:01:33.24 --> 04:01:49.24
If everything went textbook, if all 40 of my surgeries and maybe at this point it was like 20 25 left me and my mom lost count, but you know, three years and 40 surgeries, that's obviously a long time a commitment.

2718
04:01:49.24 --> 04:02:07.24
So, and with the months that I've been there, the chain of command, the Marine Corps, they met my family, they knew them, knew they were, they have my best interest, which unfortunately is not the case all the time with wounded warriors coming back.

2719
04:02:07.24 --> 04:02:23.24
And so knowing that they were going to take care of me, they have my best interest, if we agreed, if they let me go home, lay on my own couch with the dog eat moms, amazing home cooked food.

2720
04:02:23.24 --> 04:02:42.24
I could go do that with the agreement that they would just continue to extend my leave month by month. Every day I would go to the local hospital slash clinic in Lexington, South Carolina, get that daily therapy and every two weeks from

2721
04:02:42.24 --> 04:02:55.24
March 1st until September when I moved up to Walter Reed every two weeks my mom drove me from South Carolina to DC to get a surgery.

2722
04:02:55.24 --> 04:03:00.24
So, if all those agreements were good, I could go home and recover.

2723
04:03:00.24 --> 04:03:14.24
So, and when I'm getting to is, I'm at home recovering and it's March maybe early April, spring of 2011 right after the hospital.

2724
04:03:14.24 --> 04:03:32.24
And it was around 10 o'clock at night, I was winding down for the day and I mean after a whole day of therapy with the injuries I still had and how early on I was in my recovery, my as well have been three in the morning. So I was already tired, maybe a little frustrated.

2725
04:03:32.24 --> 04:03:55.24
And my mom was in the next room over the living room and there's a couple of reasons which I'll get to. There's a couple of reasons why this story goes so deep and dark so quickly.

2726
04:03:55.24 --> 04:04:17.24
And the first is, and I didn't realize this till recently, but it was the first time standing there sitting there in my kitchen that really for the first time since I joined the Marine Corps.

2727
04:04:17.24 --> 04:04:27.24
And especially from the first time that I got injured and woke up in the hospital, it was just me.

2728
04:04:27.24 --> 04:04:34.24
Not a team of six people standing around telling me, hey, it's okay to go to the bathroom in front of us in this bedpan.

2729
04:04:34.24 --> 04:04:55.24
I was out of team of people holding all the tubes coming out of me. I wasn't struggling to breathe through the tube, the track and my neck. And it was just me, my own thoughts in my own head with the ringing in my ears.

2730
04:04:55.24 --> 04:05:08.24
In that moment by myself, in the quiet and leading up to this moment, I've been taking on the monumental challenge of trying to make a bowl of cereal for myself.

2731
04:05:08.24 --> 04:05:30.24
And at this point, I hadn't had the nerve graft repair surgeries to fix my wrist from hanging. My weight was extremely low for what it, you know, my age and circumstances aside.

2732
04:05:30.24 --> 04:05:48.24
My weight was extremely low, I was extremely weak. You know, the milk, my as well weight a hundred pounds. You know, I struggled to open the box of cereal and it was almost impossible to even hold the spoon.

2733
04:05:48.24 --> 04:06:04.24
I complete the mission of making my bowl of cereal, and I'm sitting at the kitchen counter, and that was only half the battle. Now I had to try to eat it.

2734
04:06:04.24 --> 04:06:22.24
My nerves had been severed in my face. I still can't feel a portion of my face and my chin. I didn't have teeth which not only give, you know, really realize, but they give your mouth so much structure and your lips structure.

2735
04:06:22.24 --> 04:06:38.24
It gives you the ability to close your mouth to not have milk going everywhere, and not only was it going everywhere, I couldn't even feel it all over my face. And this bowl of cereal was just, dude, it was defeating me.

2736
04:06:38.24 --> 04:06:56.24
And in that moment, I completely broke, and we've already hit on it, but I know for two reasons that I broke in this moment because it was the first time I'd been by myself with only my own thoughts.

2737
04:06:56.24 --> 04:07:10.24
And also, until this point, I had been strong every day because I knew, you know, the hardest part of my entire journey was my parents suffering through that burden of recovery with me.

2738
04:07:10.24 --> 04:07:21.24
And I think now I'm knowing and going what I've been through, being on the other side of that hospital bed is a loved one. A lot of times, a helpless loved one.

2739
04:07:21.24 --> 04:07:36.24
It's exponentially harder than laying in that bed. So trying to put a smile on every day, trying not to tear up when that's all I really could do after 13 hour arm surgery, where they have been hammering metal rods through my bones.

2740
04:07:36.24 --> 04:07:52.24
And it was pain like I'd never felt all the way to the deep center core of my bones telling them, I'm not in pain, it's okay, I'm good, smiling, being strong.

2741
04:07:52.24 --> 04:08:14.24
But in that moment by myself, no one around me, almost a movie type setting, the lights were a little dim, and yeah, I completely broke. My mom rushed in and like any wonderful mother, she puts arms around me and asks if I'm in pain, what's going on.

2742
04:08:14.24 --> 04:08:26.24
And through the the the sob's I could only choke out one thing and that was, look at me, he's ever going to love me again.

2743
04:08:26.24 --> 04:08:42.24
And that's that's tough, even still now to talk about that today, but like I said, already multiple times, sometimes the deepest, darkest, lowest moments in life,

2744
04:08:42.24 --> 04:08:48.24
if teach us the most beautiful lessons.

2745
04:08:48.24 --> 04:09:04.24
And in that moment, and I'm thankful that I had this insight and I realized that, and talking about the past, that the past is truly the past.

2746
04:09:04.24 --> 04:09:32.24
And that moment, I realized that with any situation, with any obstacle or event that really knocks you down in life, every opportunity, every intersection, good or bad, you cut out the noise.

2747
04:09:32.24 --> 04:09:51.24
And this is going to be a tough pill of swallow for some people listening and it was for me, but it must be done. And that is that you cut out the noise, and you only ever have two options.

2748
04:09:51.24 --> 04:10:07.24
You can either stand up and take that small step forward. You don't have to know where you're going, you know how that, the perfect plan, you don't have to know it tomorrow holds.

2749
04:10:07.24 --> 04:10:36.24
But you can either get up and take that small step or you're going to sit at that kitchen counter for the rest of your life. And now years later, and one of my favorite lines in the book, I'm thankful that I push through those hard times and I realized, and I truly believe in now that the smallest of steps eventually completes the grandest of journeys.

2750
04:10:36.24 --> 04:10:43.24
And that is one of the parts of my mission that I'm trying to get out there and tell people and educate people about.

2751
04:10:43.24 --> 04:11:05.24
And this is by no means ending it. I already, I'm still excited and looking forward to keep going, but with that said, I appreciate you having me in this time and helping me with your platform, with that mission of helping people through that struggle and telling people,

2752
04:11:05.24 --> 04:11:26.24
and telling people that, one small step at a time, you work hard, try to stay positive, try to be a good person, do the right thing, and you know, it will not only bring you out of that, but take you to great places.

2753
04:11:26.24 --> 04:11:48.24
Yeah, I don't have anything to add to that. I mean, that's such a poignant thing to perspective to have. And it's, you know, I often talk about the fact that the first step is the hardest one.

2754
04:11:48.24 --> 04:12:03.24
And what I like about what you bring to that statement is like it doesn't matter how big that step is or more important, how small that step is.

2755
04:12:03.24 --> 04:12:13.24
You got to do something, you got to move in the right direction.

2756
04:12:13.24 --> 04:12:27.24
And you detail that, just a whole chapter in here where you, where you go through that and people got to pick this up to really reinforce those ideas.

2757
04:12:27.24 --> 04:12:30.24
So that we can push through it.

2758
04:12:30.24 --> 04:12:42.24
Here's, here's one of the things you say, kind of bringing this home at some point, everyone will face a rock bottom moment when the past looms too large to overcome and a hopeful future seems to far out to imagine.

2759
04:12:42.24 --> 04:12:48.24
I mean, just think about that right there. There's times that you're going to face where the past is too much.

2760
04:12:48.24 --> 04:12:57.24
And, and the future seems too far away too far out there. You go on. It's difficult to prepare yourself for that moment because it's impossible to know what will trigger it.

2761
04:12:57.24 --> 04:13:07.24
It may be a major setback that knocks you to the ground or could be something so seemingly minor and innocuous like trying to eat a ball of cereal, which is what you went through.

2762
04:13:07.24 --> 04:13:14.24
The point is you can't really do much ahead of time to prevent that moment from happening. You might not even be able to brace yourself for the impact.

2763
04:13:14.24 --> 04:13:23.24
All you can do is commit yourself to surviving for another day and recognizing that you can't change what is behind you, only what lies ahead.

2764
04:13:23.24 --> 04:13:32.24
You may even wonder if it's possible to move on and it might not be without professional guidance to help you process everything that your past represents.

2765
04:13:32.24 --> 04:13:40.24
It's not a process that can be rushed. You have to be honest with yourself as to whether or not it's time to let go of the past. Past.

2766
04:13:40.24 --> 04:13:48.24
Maybe the answer is not yet. And that's okay, but at some point you have to be willing to say, from this day forward, I am choosing to live.

2767
04:13:48.24 --> 04:13:57.24
Too often we fall into the trap of thinking we need to have everything figured out before we act. You don't have to have a roadmap before you set out.

2768
04:13:57.24 --> 04:14:04.24
You don't even have to know what direction you're traveling. You just have to be willing to move and leave the past behind.

2769
04:14:04.24 --> 04:14:26.24
So this is just powerful stuff. You go through and you talk about you know you went jumping with Jay Redmond, who's been on the podcast and you know a seal that was wounded very badly.

2770
04:14:26.24 --> 04:14:31.24
You did a bunch of mud runs with the Marine Corps like you're doing stuff you're pushing.

2771
04:14:31.24 --> 04:14:38.24
And this is kind of, you know, this is what you say about that, about those things. Every obstacle I took on had a whole new significance.

2772
04:14:38.24 --> 04:14:45.24
And every time I conquered one, I took on new significance too. I gained significance as someone who fought to live and was succeeding.

2773
04:14:45.24 --> 04:14:49.24
I gained significance as a combat survivor who is doing more than just surviving.

2774
04:14:49.24 --> 04:14:59.24
I gained significance as someone who attacked physical and occupational therapy with every fiber of my being and was now proving what my restored body could do.

2775
04:14:59.24 --> 04:15:03.24
I gained significance as someone who refused to let fear make his choices form.

2776
04:15:03.24 --> 04:15:08.24
I gained significance as someone who reclaimed his life unapologetically.

2777
04:15:08.24 --> 04:15:17.24
And even if that significance was only apparent to me and no one else had changed who I was in my own eyes and in my own mind.

2778
04:15:17.24 --> 04:15:22.24
My injuries will not define my life. I will.

2779
04:15:22.24 --> 04:15:30.24
And the greatest power I have that any of us has is the power to make that choice.

2780
04:15:30.24 --> 04:15:41.24
So once again, it is about taking control over what choices you make, deciding to move forward.

2781
04:15:41.24 --> 04:15:52.24
Yeah, and again, it's one thing when somebody says that stuff that, you know, their big challenge was who knows what big challenge they had.

2782
04:15:52.24 --> 04:16:08.24
But to hear it coming from you, who's literally been dead and and come back and suffered through the the recovery process, you know, it's just.

2783
04:16:08.24 --> 04:16:13.24
If you can say that, we can all say that.

2784
04:16:13.24 --> 04:16:23.24
And just add on to that and thanks for pointing that out, but that's exactly why.

2785
04:16:23.24 --> 04:16:33.24
Along with having to realize how I wanted to approach and write it, that's why this book was written now nine years later.

2786
04:16:33.24 --> 04:16:44.24
Because I didn't want to write a book not only that only military service members veterans or people that had been to combat could understand.

2787
04:16:44.24 --> 04:16:51.24
I wanted a book that.

2788
04:16:51.24 --> 04:17:03.24
I lived, I lived learn and and proved and completed the lessons that I am teaching.

2789
04:17:03.24 --> 04:17:16.24
The worst is when you get whether a book or some motivator out there telling you, you know, a whole spreadsheet of things you need to do.

2790
04:17:16.24 --> 04:17:29.24
And they have had done it themselves. And so the last thing I wouldn't have wrote it if I wouldn't have done these things, but I'm not going to tell people.

2791
04:17:29.24 --> 04:17:35.24
After you get knocked down, you can go to college earn your degree without doing that.

2792
04:17:35.24 --> 04:17:43.24
And I'm going to tell people, oh, you work hard, you know, one foot from the other and eventually one day you can run a marathon.

2793
04:17:43.24 --> 04:17:50.24
Without crossing the finish line or that marathon without jumping out of the plane back, hacking across Europe.

2794
04:17:50.24 --> 04:18:01.24
So thank you for recognizing that and I just wanted to add that, you know, people ask me like, oh, you could have wrote a book right after this happened.

2795
04:18:01.24 --> 04:18:12.24
I mean, your story was there. After the metal, you know, pretty much would have been the same book in a way yes, but not really because I.

2796
04:18:12.24 --> 04:18:18.24
I wanted to.

2797
04:18:18.24 --> 04:18:32.24
I wanted to have substance behind the things, the lessons, the challenges and victories that I talk about in this book.

2798
04:18:32.24 --> 04:18:45.24
You know, you kind of got a tone in your voice when you said some motivator out there like, and I have, I've pretty consistently talked smack about the term motivation.

2799
04:18:45.24 --> 04:18:52.24
As a matter of fact, I made a little video the other day where I was making fun of motivation Monday, right?

2800
04:18:52.24 --> 04:19:00.24
And and as I was reading your book, I got to this chapter, it's called Stay Motivated and I was like, oh, done reading.

2801
04:19:00.24 --> 04:19:09.24
And, you know, my mind is always open and I'm always looking to learn. So I was like, okay, let's see what Kyle has to say about it.

2802
04:19:09.24 --> 04:19:16.24
You said, you know, Stay Motivated, you had in quotes. Any marine reading this is rolling their eyes right now. I was like, okay, so he knows what I'm not.

2803
04:19:16.24 --> 04:19:20.24
Those two words stay motivated or pretty well worn within the core.

2804
04:19:20.24 --> 04:19:25.24
Leadership loves to say them when you're information on a grueling run or anytime there's a large lag in the conversation.

2805
04:19:25.24 --> 04:19:32.24
In fact, it seems like when you are cold and wet and hungry and dirty and missing home, that's when you say it the most stay motivated.

2806
04:19:32.24 --> 04:19:41.24
The line is become a bit of a joke in the Marines that Marines will toss around sarcastically in really miserable situations when it seems like everyone hates their life.

2807
04:19:41.24 --> 04:19:46.24
But still there's some wisdom in the phrase. So I, I checked it out.

2808
04:19:46.24 --> 04:19:48.24
And that that allowed you to keep going.

2809
04:19:48.24 --> 04:20:10.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, my mind is open and my mind is open and there's something that I realized I did a little research and the the root word of motivation, which we know motivation is like it comes across as an emotion or feeling that's what I like about it because we can't rely on it, right?

2810
04:20:10.24 --> 04:20:14.24
But the root word of it is Latin,

2811
04:20:14.24 --> 04:20:19.24
modus and it means move.

2812
04:20:19.24 --> 04:20:28.24
That's what it means move. And so you spell out all these things. You might be angry, tired, broken, hurt, confused.

2813
04:20:28.24 --> 04:20:35.24
What can you possibly do in a situation like that? Stay motivated, which ties back to what you already said.

2814
04:20:35.24 --> 04:20:38.24
You get up and you move. That's what you need to do.

2815
04:20:38.24 --> 04:20:44.24
No matter who you are or where you are in life, there are simply things that are going to be terrible.

2816
04:20:44.24 --> 04:20:50.24
But you just have to lower your head, put one foot in front of the other and walk straight into that storm.

2817
04:20:50.24 --> 04:20:54.24
Stay motivated. That's what we're talking about. We're talking about moving.

2818
04:20:54.24 --> 04:20:56.24
We're talking about taking action.

2819
04:20:56.24 --> 04:21:04.24
And when I turn that word motivation, which is like a feeling into action, then I get it.

2820
04:21:04.24 --> 04:21:14.24
Yeah, that this chunk of the book where you talk about what you went through is.

2821
04:21:14.24 --> 04:21:19.24
And you're attitude towards it. And sometimes you have to dig a little deeper.

2822
04:21:19.24 --> 04:21:27.24
You got this part here. There was a local afghan boy about 12 who loved the Marines who would always salute us when we had walk out of our patrol base on foot.

2823
04:21:27.24 --> 04:21:31.24
He and his eight-year-old brother even made a game of trying to snatch our water bottles.

2824
04:21:31.24 --> 04:21:41.24
And goodies from the dump pouches on the back of our sappy plates, which were designed to carry empty magazines from firefights, but double does a snack, candy and water bio bottle carrier.

2825
04:21:41.24 --> 04:21:50.24
The two boys got to be friends with us and through the months of talking and playing with us would sometimes tell us where well hidden IEDs were buried.

2826
04:21:50.24 --> 04:22:00.24
Our EOD guys made a good show of trying to make it appear that their discoveries were accidental before the explosives were diffused, but in Taliban, Taliban strongholds.

2827
04:22:00.24 --> 04:22:02.24
Eyes are always watching.

2828
04:22:02.24 --> 04:22:11.24
One night about two weeks after I was evacuated, a grenade was thrown over the wall of our compound and detonated at exactly the spot where my now empty bunk sat.

2829
04:22:11.24 --> 04:22:23.24
No one was injured, but obviously shook everyone up a bit. A few nights later, that same boy who used to salute us showed up at camp in the middle of the night to tell us he threw that grenade.

2830
04:22:23.24 --> 04:22:33.24
He was sobbing and begging the Marines to forgive him and not to kill him. The Taliban had caught on that he was friendly with us and that fewer IEDs were being detonated.

2831
04:22:33.24 --> 04:22:38.24
They suspected he was the cause so they beat him senseless, but they didn't kill him.

2832
04:22:38.24 --> 04:22:45.24
Instead for his final punishment, they dragged him to the wall of our compound to place the grenade in his hand and pulled the pin.

2833
04:22:45.24 --> 04:23:03.24
A 12-year-old child was forced to kill or be killed. That was just one story of countless others we heard stories of violence, rituals, stoning of women pushing people off buildings for being gay and children forced to become weapons of war.

2834
04:23:03.24 --> 04:23:13.24
How is one not affected witnessing that degree of evil? You remind yourself why you're over there in the first place to stop the Taliban and their torture and oppression of their own people.

2835
04:23:13.24 --> 04:23:26.24
You remind yourself that if you were able to weaken their stronghold or just give hope to those innocent people, even the smallest of ways so that one day they might taste the freedom of safety, then you made a difference.

2836
04:23:26.24 --> 04:23:32.24
That helps you stay focused. That helps you stay motivated.

2837
04:23:32.24 --> 04:23:41.24
That's a... I would love to say that that's a rare story, but that's what the enemy is like.

2838
04:23:41.24 --> 04:23:48.24
Yeah. That's what they do.

2839
04:23:48.24 --> 04:24:06.24
So, you know, you just mentioned that you put down your backpack, put down your rucksack and picked up a backpack, you ended up going to college, kind of fulfilling that promise to your parents.

2840
04:24:06.24 --> 04:24:22.24
And... On the afternoon of December 18, 2017, I was sitting in a folding chair on the floor of Colonial Life Arena, just adjusting my task, will make sure it was positioned correctly on my cap.

2841
04:24:22.24 --> 04:24:31.24
I was about to receive my diploma making good on the promise I'd made to my parents eight years earlier that one day I'd go back to school and earn my degree.

2842
04:24:31.24 --> 04:24:46.24
The graduation speaker introduced me to the crowd in an ounce, joining Kyle's family this afternoon on members of his medical evacuation team and two of his doctors from Walter Reed, National Military Medical Center, our thanks to you Kyle.

2843
04:24:46.24 --> 04:24:56.24
Would you please stand and receive our recognition? I stood and suddenly sewed the entire arena. My fellow students were cheering. The crowd was cheering. My family was cheering.

2844
04:24:56.24 --> 04:25:10.24
And I realized that I had really done it. We had really done it. My family, my peers and all the people had been with who kept me alive along the way, both literally and figuratively.

2845
04:25:10.24 --> 04:25:20.24
So, you graduated from college. And while you were doing that, you were also running marathons, right? You have that timeline correct?

2846
04:25:20.24 --> 04:25:29.24
The first one was 2013. All three were Marine Corps Marathon for the Simper Fife Fund in Washington, D.C.

2847
04:25:29.24 --> 04:25:39.24
And the first one I completed was October after I got out of the hospital in July.

2848
04:25:39.24 --> 04:25:56.24
And then the next two were the few years following that. The second one actually, which I don't recommend because I didn't think about circling and cruising around in the clouds over the Pentagon before I skydived out into the starting line.

2849
04:25:56.24 --> 04:26:06.24
It was a solid 20 minutes worth of invisible air squads, ramp up in that plane, waiting for the sun to break over the horizon.

2850
04:26:06.24 --> 04:26:19.24
And so I landed and if I hadn't put my sweet mother through enough already, of course it was not the greatest weather and it was windy that day.

2851
04:26:19.24 --> 04:26:34.24
So, I'm not only skydiving in front of her, putting her through that, but the wind, because I jumped with team fast tracks, all some team, most of which are our former operators and special forces.

2852
04:26:34.24 --> 04:26:49.24
And myself and my jump partner got blown off course. Ironically crash landing, I'm talking, sliding in between headstones and our LinkedIn cemetery.

2853
04:26:49.24 --> 04:26:57.24
I thought, oh man, I hope this isn't about to express me into being on one of these spots right now.

2854
04:26:57.24 --> 04:27:08.24
This is so completely crazy. They were running marifons, parachuting. This is just ridiculous. I might, I might like have a talk with your mom. We might need to take you out.

2855
04:27:08.24 --> 04:27:10.24
I believe I think I've actually understood.

2856
04:27:10.24 --> 04:27:12.24
I'm not a father yet.

2857
04:27:12.24 --> 04:27:22.24
So, I crashed into Arlington. I'm sprinting to the starting line, undressing at him, at him a gear, doing an interview right as a cannon goes off.

2858
04:27:22.24 --> 04:27:32.24
I made that one. But these marifons came up very early on when I was in the hospital.

2859
04:27:32.24 --> 04:27:45.24
When I said earlier, you might be a little different, physically mentally or emotionally, but you can truly come back better and stronger than you were before, whatever not you'd down.

2860
04:27:45.24 --> 04:27:54.24
And that lesson comes from early on when I was breathing through that tube.

2861
04:27:54.24 --> 04:28:08.24
When I had my arms tied up from swelling, when I had to go to the bathroom in a bed pan in front of my parents and six to eight medical staff in the hospital.

2862
04:28:08.24 --> 04:28:17.24
And that low, not down, seemingly hopeless state.

2863
04:28:17.24 --> 04:28:33.24
I decided to think of something that I could do, whether it was a year from then or just at some point in my life.

2864
04:28:33.24 --> 04:28:49.24
I tried to think of something I could do to show and prove to myself that I was not only back, but again I was better and stronger than before.

2865
04:28:49.24 --> 04:28:58.24
And I thought at the time, I mean, I can't say I was 100% confident. I was going to accomplish this goal.

2866
04:28:58.24 --> 04:29:14.24
But I set the goal to run a marathon. And years later, I was 2011, first marathon. So over two years later, when I crossed the finish line of that first marathon,

2867
04:29:14.24 --> 04:29:29.24
I think what I had sunglasses on, I was tearing up because, you know, for years I had been telling myself,

2868
04:29:29.24 --> 04:29:45.24
I'm going to keep thought to myself, coaching myself. And I think doing it so much, unknowingly just trying to convince myself that, hey, I really can get better, come back stronger.

2869
04:29:45.24 --> 04:30:00.24
I knew I could and I did believe those things, but again, sometimes that goal or the future is so far away and you have to go through so much to get to it.

2870
04:30:00.24 --> 04:30:13.24
But that's not that I didn't believe myself, but it's kind of like until it happened, I couldn't fully buy into it. Just weird because it was my own just internal talking advice.

2871
04:30:13.24 --> 04:30:29.24
But when I crossed the finish line of that marathon, it was such an incredible, amazing beautiful moment because not only was I just like I do every day in life, any new experience I have, any experience I have,

2872
04:30:29.24 --> 04:30:49.24
I have period, just sitting before we drove here this morning, sitting and watching the sun come up. Anything I do, I literally can't help but to think, wow, I was so close to not experiencing this right now, bigger small.

2873
04:30:49.24 --> 04:31:16.24
So when I crossed the line of that marathon, that finish line and they drape that that metal around my neck, in that moment, I proved to myself what I have been hurting and working,

2874
04:31:16.24 --> 04:31:42.24
striving, getting knocked down every single day for, and after years, in that moment, I not only realized but I fully believe it solidify permanently for every in my mind, what I have been teaching myself, day in, day out and through those long, dark and painful nights.

2875
04:31:42.24 --> 04:31:55.24
That's an incredible journey and I cannot believe that the journey only lasted two years to get to you for your first Marine Corps marathon from the time you got wounded.

2876
04:31:55.24 --> 04:32:00.24
Yeah, which I don't recommend whatsoever.

2877
04:32:00.24 --> 04:32:11.24
You got all this stuff going on, you got your recovery going on, you got your going to college, your run in marathons, your skydiving, your skydiving in the marathon.

2878
04:32:11.24 --> 04:32:29.24
And at some point, you start hearing the, and you talk about it in the book when you first start getting some indication that their, their, the metal of honor could be in your future.

2879
04:32:29.24 --> 04:32:42.24
And again, you, you, you talk about it in the book, you kind of build to it the little indicators along the way, and then you get to this here on an unassuming day in February.

2880
04:32:42.24 --> 04:32:49.24
I was notified that I should expect to call from President Obama the following Monday at 136 p.m.

2881
04:32:49.24 --> 04:32:58.24
This seemed weirdly specific until I remember that the leader of the free world has more than a few demands on his time and probably runs a pretty tight schedule.

2882
04:32:58.24 --> 04:33:02.24
I told my parents, of course, but they didn't say a word of it to my brothers.

2883
04:33:02.24 --> 04:33:08.24
I think we thought it would be more fun for them to be caught off guard.

2884
04:33:08.24 --> 04:33:20.24
And we were going to go on, but call came through at 136 on the dot. Remember being surprised that an actual number appeared on my phone screen rather than an unknown caller message.

2885
04:33:20.24 --> 04:33:29.24
But it must have been the number for the central switchboard at the White House. I answered the phone and a stern sounding woman on the other end announced.

2886
04:33:29.24 --> 04:33:33.24
Stand by. Have the president United States on the phone for you.

2887
04:33:33.24 --> 04:33:41.24
That was all I could get out after such a profound statement. A moment later, a voice familiar to me came on.

2888
04:33:41.24 --> 04:33:46.24
Kyle said the president in a surprisingly conversational friendly and upbeat tone.

2889
04:33:46.24 --> 04:33:52.24
It immediately set me at ease. Or as much as the eddies you can be at when you're talking to the commander and chief.

2890
04:33:52.24 --> 04:33:57.24
Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm fine, sir. How are you?

2891
04:33:57.24 --> 04:34:02.24
Am I really making small talk with the president? I thought to myself.

2892
04:34:02.24 --> 04:34:12.24
I'm doing just fine. Thanks. He answered. Then he continued. It is my pleasure to let you know that based on the recommendation of the secretary, the navy and the secretary, the defense of defense.

2893
04:34:12.24 --> 04:34:24.24
I've approved the Medal of Honor to be awarded to you for your courageous actions in Afghanistan and support of operation during freedom.

2894
04:34:24.24 --> 04:34:30.24
There it was. It was happening.

2895
04:34:30.24 --> 04:34:40.24
That's got to be a hard thing to kind of contemplate.

2896
04:34:40.24 --> 04:34:49.24
That you are joining this, you know, Legion of our most profound heroes.

2897
04:34:49.24 --> 04:34:52.24
And how will do you at this point in time?

2898
04:34:52.24 --> 04:35:08.24
25, 25. Self-worn college. I had left class to drive home, received the call after entering my home and getting yelled at by my mother.

2899
04:35:08.24 --> 04:35:15.24
Because my first question was, does anyone have a phone charger? I'm on 7%.

2900
04:35:15.24 --> 04:35:24.24
So I was not prepared for the mission you could say. And I also got yelled at even though it was a call on speaker phone.

2901
04:35:24.24 --> 04:35:29.24
With no video that my shoes that I was wearing were nasty.

2902
04:35:29.24 --> 04:35:39.24
And so after getting reprimanded, I received that incredible and surreal phone call.

2903
04:35:39.24 --> 04:35:50.24
And at this point, for years we had heard not really any updates, but it also hadn't ended.

2904
04:35:50.24 --> 04:36:01.24
So one can only assume, especially with the months before this, since the previous November of 2013, the year before I received the Medal,

2905
04:36:01.24 --> 04:36:15.24
at the Combinance Marine Corps birthday ball, my mom and I sat down for a casual meeting with a Marine by the name of Kendra Motts.

2906
04:36:15.24 --> 04:36:20.24
She worked public relations, such public affairs for the Marine Corps.

2907
04:36:20.24 --> 04:36:28.24
And she wanted to sit down with us and say, hey, we have no idea where this thing is.

2908
04:36:28.24 --> 04:36:37.24
Where it's going to go if it's even going to happen. But looking ahead at your next semester's school, you know, I recovered.

2909
04:36:37.24 --> 04:36:50.24
I left the hospital. I've been out of the hospital for, you know, I guess now that I'm thinking about only a few months, but by the time the the the Medal rolled around.

2910
04:36:50.24 --> 04:36:59.24
I had already had to not only recover, but get on with my life, make that transition. So as a sophomore college, they knew that that was my new mission.

2911
04:36:59.24 --> 04:37:04.24
That it was my priority and I wanted to do good at it and give it my best.

2912
04:37:04.24 --> 04:37:17.24
And it was kind of, you know, them looking out for me and all of this was so weird as we went along because all of these, you know, I had to

2913
04:37:17.24 --> 04:37:27.24
do all of this preparatory work for something that not even the highest Marines knew where it was at.

2914
04:37:27.24 --> 04:37:35.24
And they wouldn't tell me, of course, even if they did, but I believe they truly did not know.

2915
04:37:35.24 --> 04:37:46.24
And so with that said, as the first couple months, it was just like, hey, this could potentially happen.

2916
04:37:46.24 --> 04:37:55.24
Even though we don't know if it's going to happen, we need to adequately prepare you.

2917
04:37:55.24 --> 04:38:05.24
So what that said, it was kind of like, hey, if you want to do good at school, we suggest, unfortunately, that you need to withdraw from this semester.

2918
04:38:05.24 --> 04:38:13.24
But once I got word that I was going to be receiving that call, it was beginning of February.

2919
04:38:13.24 --> 04:38:26.24
So I was still just a few weeks into the semester. And I was thinking, hey, I'm going to stick this out and wait for this in saying call if it actually is going to come to happen.

2920
04:38:26.24 --> 04:38:32.24
Before I withdraw and lose a semester of time, energy effort and class credits.

2921
04:38:32.24 --> 04:38:44.24
And so yeah, I left class. I took the call. I drove back for some reason to make the next class and finish out the day strong before I withdrew from my classes.

2922
04:38:44.24 --> 04:38:51.24
And it was so strange still to this day sitting through that history class and thinking, okay, well, it's kind of crazy.

2923
04:38:51.24 --> 04:38:58.24
I was just talking to the president of the United States and now I'm in my sophomore college history class.

2924
04:38:58.24 --> 04:39:04.24
And so, but after that, yeah, I got the call. We knew it was going to happen. We still couldn't tell anyone.

2925
04:39:04.24 --> 04:39:20.24
So I was at the Pentagon every other week, all week going through chaos, training, everything from sitting in a room for hours getting drill by two who were awesome and really did good to get me prepared.

2926
04:39:20.24 --> 04:39:30.24
But almost an interrogation set up and really moved every question that could be detrimental to me or learning how to.

2927
04:39:30.24 --> 04:39:37.24
If I don't want to answer a question directly, navigating that reporter, that interview and the direction that I wanted to take it.

2928
04:39:37.24 --> 04:39:45.24
But all my friends, I couldn't tell anyone saw my friends thought I was still in class. So, like, oh, how are finals going? Oh, yeah, well, they're good.

2929
04:39:45.24 --> 04:39:53.24
Not knowing I was just a freaking Pentagon all week and then hanging out with them on the weekends, going to football and basketball games.

2930
04:39:53.24 --> 04:40:00.24
But yeah, it was incredibly surreal to receive that phone call.

2931
04:40:00.24 --> 04:40:06.24
But even when I received that phone call, it made it no more real.

2932
04:40:06.24 --> 04:40:24.24
I think just one of those things in life that like combat, like the unknown of the life of service holds, I think you can, you can only comprehend and process to a certain extent until those actual moments happen and you're exposed to it.

2933
04:40:24.24 --> 04:40:33.24
But yeah, if that's for a few months after my imaginary semester that I was suffering through.

2934
04:40:33.24 --> 04:40:54.24
I did receive the Melavonner as along with Dakota, the second living recipient, Marina Scipient, since Vietnam, and still currently thankfully that.

2935
04:40:54.24 --> 04:41:05.24
I'm still the youngest living recipient of that incredible and homelowing honor and award.

2936
04:41:05.24 --> 04:41:17.24
You, I mean, you do a great job of in the book of talking about, you know, the ceremony and doing the interviews and the pressure and the White House and all those things going on.

2937
04:41:17.24 --> 04:41:24.24
But, and it's definitely worth reading to get some appreciation.

2938
04:41:24.24 --> 04:41:33.24
If you don't understand what this award means, that will begin to give you some appreciation of what it means for the person that's receiving it.

2939
04:41:33.24 --> 04:41:37.24
I mean, just what you are, what is happening to you?

2940
04:41:37.24 --> 04:41:42.24
You do a great job of explaining that in the book.

2941
04:41:42.24 --> 04:41:52.24
But I really like this section here, which also kind of explains what the Medal of Honor means.

2942
04:41:52.24 --> 04:41:57.24
It says, the thing I want people to understand is that the Medal of Honor is a heavy distinction.

2943
04:41:57.24 --> 04:42:02.24
It only weighs a couple of ounces, but the physical weight is nothing compared to the weight of what it represents.

2944
04:42:02.24 --> 04:42:11.24
Everything that the Medal symbolizes, not just the circumstances under which it was earned, but the broader conflict of which that action was part.

2945
04:42:11.24 --> 04:42:17.24
And all of the losses that are a result of that conflict adds weight.

2946
04:42:17.24 --> 04:42:24.24
One of my friends from deployment told me that when he saw the president plays the Medal around my neck, he cried,

2947
04:42:24.24 --> 04:42:31.24
because our unit, our story and the guys we lost will never die after that.

2948
04:42:31.24 --> 04:42:39.24
For my fellow Marines, he said the Medal was a part of everyone's deployment.

2949
04:42:39.24 --> 04:42:50.24
And you go on and hear talking a little bit more about awards, and you say, the ribbon rack never tells the full story of a person's service.

2950
04:42:50.24 --> 04:42:58.24
But having served alongside someone who is awarded the Medal of Honor somehow helps to capture in a bigger sense what we all went through.

2951
04:42:58.24 --> 04:43:07.24
Even beyond our current operations, when you start trying to add up each casualty, each death, each injury, the mental scars.

2952
04:43:07.24 --> 04:43:15.24
And every person listed as MIA over nearly 250 years of military conflicts, it's overwhelming.

2953
04:43:15.24 --> 04:43:20.24
I marvel to at the tremendous acts of bravery and heroism.

2954
04:43:20.24 --> 04:43:28.24
From the Civil War, Spanish American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Somalia, O-E-F-O-I-F,

2955
04:43:28.24 --> 04:43:35.24
even to the special forces in intelligence communities who operate without recognition in places we will never know.

2956
04:43:35.24 --> 04:43:41.24
That never got told. Maybe those stories weren't told because there was no one around to witness them.

2957
04:43:41.24 --> 04:43:45.24
Maybe they weren't told because no one survived to tell them.

2958
04:43:45.24 --> 04:43:51.24
Maybe they were told, but some external factors stood in the way of someone getting the honor they deserved.

2959
04:43:51.24 --> 04:43:57.24
That is why I often say the Medal doesn't belong to me, not really.

2960
04:43:57.24 --> 04:44:00.24
My story just happened to be noticed.

2961
04:44:00.24 --> 04:44:07.24
Thinking that the Medal of Honor, thinking of the Medal of Honor as an individual award,

2962
04:44:07.24 --> 04:44:10.24
couldn't be any further from the truth.

2963
04:44:18.24 --> 04:44:29.24
Yeah, I mean, hard to sum up in words, but that's a pretty good shot at it, to explain what it means.

2964
04:44:29.24 --> 04:44:34.24
And certainly for me, having served with Mikey Montsour, everything you're talking about that,

2965
04:44:34.24 --> 04:44:40.24
the yearmarines felt, you know, I know that myself and the rest of the guys in task in a bruiser,

2966
04:44:40.24 --> 04:44:44.24
we all feel that pride.

2967
04:44:44.24 --> 04:44:47.24
We all understand that sacrifice.

2968
04:44:47.24 --> 04:44:50.24
And it's not just limited to guys in task in a bruiser.

2969
04:44:50.24 --> 04:45:00.24
Everyone that was in a body with us, they all feel the same way.

2970
04:45:00.24 --> 04:45:08.24
You know, you end up, I guess you're, I guess you know, when you were, you said you were a kid with a lot of energy,

2971
04:45:08.24 --> 04:45:14.24
well, that hasn't really been stifled out despite grenades and whatnot.

2972
04:45:14.24 --> 04:45:20.24
Because you end up going on something that you call a gratitude tour, and you go around the country,

2973
04:45:20.24 --> 04:45:24.24
and you actually go around the world, because you go to Afghanistan, you go to Germany, you go and you meet people,

2974
04:45:24.24 --> 04:45:39.24
and you thank people, the medical people, the Medivac crews, the rehab folks, everyone that, that kind of played a role in your survival and your rehab and your recovery.

2975
04:45:39.24 --> 04:45:45.24
And you basically go around, and you say thank you.

2976
04:45:45.24 --> 04:45:56.24
And you say something here, there is a power in moving from someone who only receives to someone who's able to give to.

2977
04:45:56.24 --> 04:46:00.24
For me, it marked a major shift in my view of myself and of my view of the world.

2978
04:46:00.24 --> 04:46:08.24
Even though my healing journey will never really be over, the opportunities I've had to thank people have helped me move beyond the chapter of my life,

2979
04:46:08.24 --> 04:46:17.24
dedicated to recovery. Now I can look ahead to whatever comes next, making something out of this life that so many people work to save.

2980
04:46:17.24 --> 04:46:21.24
The healing power of saying thank you is immense.

2981
04:46:21.24 --> 04:46:26.24
I believe this with every ounce of my being.

2982
04:46:26.24 --> 04:46:32.24
I can't imagine anything more beautiful in this world than gratitude, feeling it, expressing it, receiving it.

2983
04:46:32.24 --> 04:46:39.24
Gratitude is at the heart of every thank you for your service that someone offers to a veteran.

2984
04:46:39.24 --> 04:46:49.24
I understand the feeling of not knowing what to say, but wanting to say something because the gift that was given is too significant to go unignolaged.

2985
04:46:49.24 --> 04:47:02.24
I appreciate the gratitude that is shared with me, but I hope people know that I owe so much more thanks than I will ever be able to express.

2986
04:47:02.24 --> 04:47:09.24
Gratitude, I've come to learn, is one of the most important parts of becoming a whole person and building a life of significance.

2987
04:47:09.24 --> 04:47:18.24
Gratitude requires wisdom to recognize the roles of others. It requires humility to admit that you couldn't have done it alone.

2988
04:47:18.24 --> 04:47:25.24
It requires strength to be able to give part of yourself, back to someone and know there is still enough of you left to thrive.

2989
04:47:25.24 --> 04:47:33.24
And it requires inner peace to be able to say what you did for me helped to create a life.

2990
04:47:33.24 --> 04:47:40.24
I'm glad to call mine.

2991
04:47:40.24 --> 04:48:01.24
And before we end here today, even though the uncreected proof which we just went through in the final copy are same content essentially the same.

2992
04:48:01.24 --> 04:48:09.24
The uncreected proof does not have the introduction or my parting thoughts.

2993
04:48:09.24 --> 04:48:24.24
And the parting thoughts is one of the most important, important lessons I would like to convey here today.

2994
04:48:24.24 --> 04:48:40.24
And the end of the parting thoughts are I guess really clicked as we as a whole.

2995
04:48:40.24 --> 04:48:53.24
I wrote them to help people not this count their own.

2996
04:48:53.24 --> 04:49:00.24
And I wrote them to help people who are not in the same situation or struggle.

2997
04:49:00.24 --> 04:49:11.24
Because going through the years and all the while going through school and before the middle after the hospital and even during the hospital.

2998
04:49:11.24 --> 04:49:16.24
I had slowly started, even though I didn't really know what I was doing.

2999
04:49:16.24 --> 04:49:22.24
I had slowly started to work towards building not only the professional side of my life, but the public speaking side of my life.

3000
04:49:22.24 --> 04:49:37.24
And going through the events over the years, people would always come up to me and say, if they weren't in the military, they would say, well, you know, I was never in the military.

3001
04:49:37.24 --> 04:49:41.24
I never did or went through anything like you.

3002
04:49:41.24 --> 04:49:51.24
If they are service members or veterans, they come up and essentially say the same thing, but it's hey, I wasn't infantry or...

3003
04:49:51.24 --> 04:49:57.24
I didn't do anything like you did or I wouldn't have jumped on a grenade.

3004
04:49:57.24 --> 04:50:09.24
As you can see from one of the first chapters of the book, if you would have asked me, hey, in 10 minutes will you jump on a grenade?

3005
04:50:09.24 --> 04:50:16.24
I couldn't, and I don't believe anyone could confidently say yes.

3006
04:50:16.24 --> 04:50:36.24
And with these parting thoughts I wanted to not only lay that out and say that we should never compare our journeys or struggles, even our triumphs.

3007
04:50:36.24 --> 04:50:52.24
But also to show people that...

3008
04:50:52.24 --> 04:51:05.24
The beautiful thing about people and the human spirit, which I see this, you know, take my name out of it, my story, I see this book as an example and as a journey.

3009
04:51:05.24 --> 04:51:11.24
Not a me, but as of what the human spirit can go through.

3010
04:51:11.24 --> 04:51:32.24
So with that said, these parting thoughts I wrote, did not only help people not discredit their own situations, lives, circumstances and struggles, but also to tell people that the beautiful thing about that human spirit is, you never know...

3011
04:51:32.24 --> 04:51:47.24
When, how, or to what capacity you're going to step up in a time of need for someone else and be that here to someone else, big or small.

3012
04:51:47.24 --> 04:52:05.24
And so, thanks for letting me put that out there, but I had to do that because on one hand it was good and turned out to be a positive that people were coming up and telling me those things.

3013
04:52:05.24 --> 04:52:31.24
Because I realized and I had this light bulb moment as I was going through years of thinking about, okay, if and when I graduate from school or if and when I get the time and sanity in my life to maybe start a project like this, I'm willing, I'll be motivated and I will do that.

3014
04:52:31.24 --> 04:52:47.24
But, and, and because I had to speaking the school, the metal, I thinkfully things are too chaotic, so I couldn't have this light bulb moment before the timing was right.

3015
04:52:47.24 --> 04:53:00.24
But, as I thought about how would I write this book, because again, I don't want to book that only people that have been to combat could understand.

3016
04:53:00.24 --> 04:53:23.24
I realized, after all these people have been coming up and saying, well, I was never in the military, but, and then proceed to tell me their own version of struggle, I realize, of course, everyone can relate to struggle and everyone physically, mentally or emotionally has struggled and can relate.

3017
04:53:23.24 --> 04:53:39.24
And, and really thinking about it, realizing that struggle beyond religion, beyond really anything but love, struggle is the only common thread throughout every single person on this earth.

3018
04:53:39.24 --> 04:53:52.24
And so, when I realized that that's the thing I could write about and I could just work on the terminology and take everything I've been through and allow everyone to relate and understand, that was amazing.

3019
04:53:52.24 --> 04:54:14.24
But, also, it's sad and hard to hear these people just after they hear my story or research about my story. For the first thing they tell me is, you know, comparing their struggle and what they haven't done or haven't been through.

3020
04:54:14.24 --> 04:54:30.24
And so, one of the most important pieces of this book is to tell people, you know, don't discount yourself, your journey, your struggles, everybody handles adversity differently, everyone heals in their own time.

3021
04:54:30.24 --> 04:54:56.24
And, and you never know, again, how or to what capacity you're going to step up and take that grenade and combat or in life for those around you.

3022
04:54:56.24 --> 04:55:04.24
Yeah, as you were saying this as you were going through this, I was kind of following your thoughts.

3023
04:55:04.24 --> 04:55:11.24
And you said something about, take me out of this picture, take, you know, remove me from this.

3024
04:55:11.24 --> 04:55:19.24
And I mean, we've gone over countless stories on this podcast of the strength of the human will and the human spirit is beyond comprehension.

3025
04:55:19.24 --> 04:55:25.24
But when you said, take me out of this, I actually did something a little bit different.

3026
04:55:25.24 --> 04:55:30.24
In my mind, I sat here and said to myself, what if we take the grenade out of the picture?

3027
04:55:30.24 --> 04:55:38.24
What if what if that didn't happen to you? What if that just didn't happen? Those Taliban didn't attack that day?

3028
04:55:38.24 --> 04:55:43.24
You went on that deployment, you came home, you carried on with your life.

3029
04:55:43.24 --> 04:55:52.24
And when you said to people, don't discount your struggle. Don't discount what you've been through.

3030
04:55:52.24 --> 04:56:02.24
I started thinking to myself and came to the same conclusion that you just said, which is, you don't know.

3031
04:56:02.24 --> 04:56:12.24
Don't discount the fact that you've got this in you, you're a human being and the strength of the human will and the human spirit.

3032
04:56:12.24 --> 04:56:19.24
Just because you haven't measured it yet doesn't mean that it's not there.

3033
04:56:19.24 --> 04:56:39.24
And that's an incredibly humble thing for you to be saying, but from your perspective, after hearing this over and over again, it makes sense that someone that's been through what you've been through can connect those dots and paint a picture for all of us to see.

3034
04:56:39.24 --> 04:56:55.24
So yeah, thank you. And those parts, like you mentioned this book, and I've mentioned, it's called you are worth it and building a life worth fighting for by Kyle Carpenter.

3035
04:56:55.24 --> 04:57:09.24
I know you talk about gratitude and I hope that I know that you like to give gratitude, but I hope that you can accept some gratitude from all of us.

3036
04:57:09.24 --> 04:57:19.24
We've been going for almost five hours and it's just been incredible to sit here with you, talk to you.

3037
04:57:19.24 --> 04:57:29.24
So, accept some gratitude from me, from everyone that's listening for your sacrifice for writing this book for sharing your lessons.

3038
04:57:29.24 --> 04:57:35.24
People want to, you know, keep up with you.

3039
04:57:35.24 --> 04:57:45.24
How do we do it? Facebook, we got Facebook, we got Instagram and Twitter, Facebook, your William Kyle Carpenter.

3040
04:57:45.24 --> 04:57:55.24
And Instagram and Twitter, you have a unique call sign on there, which is at ChickStigSkars.

3041
04:57:55.24 --> 04:58:01.24
So at ChickStigSkars with no C, by the way, it's an H.I.K.S. DigSkars.

3042
04:58:01.24 --> 04:58:11.24
And then you're also available on, you got your own website, which is William Kyle Carpenter.com.

3043
04:58:11.24 --> 04:58:25.24
And that's how people can track you and you've got all kinds of stuff going on, speaking, talking to companies, your Twitter, your Instagrams, cool, you're always posting stuff on there.

3044
04:58:25.24 --> 04:58:28.24
I know, like I said, we've been going for almost five hours.

3045
04:58:28.24 --> 04:58:36.24
Do you got anything else you want to say, anything else you want to close out with?

3046
04:58:36.24 --> 04:58:41.24
Well, I'll just throw it right back at you. Thank you for having me.

3047
04:58:41.24 --> 04:58:59.24
And not only am I sincerely honored to have been here today, but again, thank you for lending me your platform and helping me get the good word out about helping people through their struggle.

3048
04:58:59.24 --> 04:59:17.24
But you know, you have helped me along the way. And I appreciate the strength and reality checks that I hate sometimes when I'm rolling out about eight,

3049
04:59:17.24 --> 04:59:41.24
and I'm running the morning out of sea. You've already had half of a day, but yeah, you're the man, Joca, and I thank you for this. And as a person, but you know, maybe seal with a, you know, Superman type career and the things you've been there and what you've done, it's awesome.

3050
04:59:41.24 --> 04:59:44.24
And it's, it's home-winged to be here.

3051
04:59:44.24 --> 04:59:56.24
I can promise you that I was no Superman and it's certainly I'm not, but I appreciate you coming on. I can't even express that enough.

3052
04:59:56.24 --> 05:00:13.24
And most important, I think is just thank you for setting in example, for setting example for all of us to follow of what courage is, of what honor is, and thank you for representing.

3053
05:00:13.24 --> 05:00:23.24
And not just the Marine Corps, but representing men like Jason Dunham and Michael Montsour, what you're walking around here doing.

3054
05:00:23.24 --> 05:00:30.24
And I know that we will never forget them.

3055
05:00:30.24 --> 05:00:49.24
And we will always be grateful for men like them and for men like you and for all of those who go forward, and different, defend freedom in the world. So thank you.

3056
05:00:49.24 --> 05:00:52.24
You're worth it.

3057
05:00:52.24 --> 05:01:09.24
And with that, Kyle has left the building, obviously, just an incredible story, an incredible human being. And I am lucky to be able to talk to people like Kyle.

3058
05:01:09.24 --> 05:01:18.24
And I'm lucky to be able to talk to people like you out there listening, which if you didn't know, I'm going to some cities.

3059
05:01:18.24 --> 05:01:25.24
And I'm going to talk directly to you in person. This is, in fact, a tour.

3060
05:01:25.24 --> 05:01:37.24
So at one point, not too long ago, I was saying, look, we're not a rock band in echelon front. We don't go on tour. The master is two, maybe three times a year.

3061
05:01:37.24 --> 05:01:50.24
But this is an a master. This is just me talking. So it's not taking the entire resources of echelon front and focusing on this. So it's just me and it's a tour. So here's what's going on.

3062
05:01:50.24 --> 05:01:58.24
The live gigs in, first of all, January 6th in Washington, DC.

3063
05:01:58.24 --> 05:02:16.24
January 11th in Austin, Texas, which is sold out January 16th in New York, January 20th in LA, January 27th in Seattle, and January 28th in San Francisco.

3064
05:02:16.24 --> 05:02:21.24
So if you want to come to those, go to jockellive.com.

3065
05:02:21.24 --> 05:02:29.24
And again, we already have one show that is sold out. Apologize apologies for that.

3066
05:02:29.24 --> 05:02:37.24
We'll do more. But if you want to come to these other gigs, go to jockellive.com and get tickets. Come see me, come hang out.

3067
05:02:37.24 --> 05:02:44.24
I'm going to talk. I'm going to go deep on some stuff. Going to bring the heat.

3068
05:02:44.24 --> 05:02:53.24
Yeah, that's what we're doing. So jockellive.com echo.

3069
05:02:53.24 --> 05:03:00.24
I know that have a Kyle Carpenter on here can definitely change your perspective on things.

3070
05:03:00.24 --> 05:03:08.24
I know that we all have the opportunity to kind of create the life that we want.

3071
05:03:08.24 --> 05:03:15.24
The best possible life that we can create for ourselves seems like a good plan.

3072
05:03:15.24 --> 05:03:25.24
And I was wondering, you know, what you have thoughts, advice, maybe perspective on what things might make our life better.

3073
05:03:25.24 --> 05:03:29.24
And by our life, I mean, all of us, all of our lives better.

3074
05:03:29.24 --> 05:03:37.24
And at the same time, also, we'll provide support to this podcast so that we can continue to bring people.

3075
05:03:37.24 --> 05:03:45.24
Like Kyle Carpenter on and share his story, document his story.

3076
05:03:45.24 --> 05:03:51.24
Document his story. I mean, I'm saying his story, little play on words here.

3077
05:03:51.24 --> 05:03:54.24
Straight up history.

3078
05:03:54.24 --> 05:03:56.24
History.

3079
05:03:56.24 --> 05:04:00.24
So that's what we're doing. So what do you have? What do you have for recommendations for us?

3080
05:04:00.24 --> 05:04:01.24
Improving your life.

3081
05:04:01.24 --> 05:04:02.24
Improving your life.

3082
05:04:02.24 --> 05:04:04.24
Broadly any recommendations.

3083
05:04:04.24 --> 05:04:11.24
All right. Well, due to you two, right. That's the thing that comes to mind first.

3084
05:04:11.24 --> 05:04:16.24
Due to some talking in a friend happens to be named Keenan Cornelius.

3085
05:04:16.24 --> 05:04:17.24
Due to you guys.

3086
05:04:17.24 --> 05:04:20.24
And I mentioned it to some,

3087
05:04:20.24 --> 05:04:22.24
Due to you guys kind of understand.

3088
05:04:22.24 --> 05:04:23.24
Understanding, yes, sir.

3089
05:04:23.24 --> 05:04:28.24
Because Keenan is a real good. Let's say due to play or even that's an understanding.

3090
05:04:28.24 --> 05:04:29.24
And that's an understanding.

3091
05:04:29.24 --> 05:04:36.24
So he and we talked about it briefly at the master. So you two improve your life.

3092
05:04:36.24 --> 05:04:43.24
And you know how you do you we, I guess, but you do a good job in spreading the word of that notion.

3093
05:04:43.24 --> 05:04:44.24
Try to.

3094
05:04:44.24 --> 05:04:45.24
Yes.

3095
05:04:45.24 --> 05:04:47.24
Did you help me with my life?

3096
05:04:47.24 --> 05:04:49.24
But I don't want to keep it a secret.

3097
05:04:49.24 --> 05:04:50.24
Yeah.

3098
05:04:50.24 --> 05:04:53.24
I want everybody to know that because it'll make everybody's life better.

3099
05:04:53.24 --> 05:04:54.24
Yeah.

3100
05:04:54.24 --> 05:04:55.24
So it's no secret.

3101
05:04:55.24 --> 05:04:56.24
We're spreading the word.

3102
05:04:56.24 --> 05:04:59.24
Hey, in the old days it was a secret.

3103
05:04:59.24 --> 05:05:04.24
When I started Gigi to a secret, you weren't allowed to show people that weren't in your academy.

3104
05:05:04.24 --> 05:05:05.24
Anything about you, Gigi.

3105
05:05:05.24 --> 05:05:09.24
Yeah. And back then, you would have more like a way higher percentage.

3106
05:05:09.24 --> 05:05:14.24
If not everybody was like, if you did Gigi to your in your doing Gigi to you know,

3107
05:05:14.24 --> 05:05:16.24
it wasn't you're not a casual Gigi to you know.

3108
05:05:16.24 --> 05:05:19.24
It was really, it was more way more rare, you know.

3109
05:05:19.24 --> 05:05:23.24
Now it's starting to have like a casual Gigi to person, you know.

3110
05:05:23.24 --> 05:05:28.24
And some people might think that that's like not that good, you know.

3111
05:05:28.24 --> 05:05:32.24
Because like, hey, where Gigi to you guys, you're just a guy, you're not kind of thing.

3112
05:05:32.24 --> 05:05:33.24
And I dig it.

3113
05:05:33.24 --> 05:05:38.24
But I think that having casual Gigi to people is highly beneficial.

3114
05:05:38.24 --> 05:05:45.24
In fact, it'll help not only the normal non-hardcore Gigi to people,

3115
05:05:45.24 --> 05:05:49.24
not only they know help them for sure, but it'll even help the hardcore Gigi to people.

3116
05:05:49.24 --> 05:05:50.24
Yeah.

3117
05:05:50.24 --> 05:05:51.24
More people in Gigi to is better.

3118
05:05:51.24 --> 05:05:53.24
It's better for everybody.

3119
05:05:53.24 --> 05:05:54.24
For everybody.

3120
05:05:54.24 --> 05:05:55.24
100%.

3121
05:05:55.24 --> 05:06:00.24
And that's not to mention the personal benefits you get from doing Gigi to.

3122
05:06:00.24 --> 05:06:02.24
Wait, that is the personal benefits.

3123
05:06:02.24 --> 05:06:05.24
Oh, but you're saying collectively it helps, but it also helps individually.

3124
05:06:05.24 --> 05:06:06.24
Yes.

3125
05:06:06.24 --> 05:06:07.24
100%.

3126
05:06:07.24 --> 05:06:10.24
So, do Gigi to, if you don't do Gigi to you.

3127
05:06:10.24 --> 05:06:12.24
So we're doing Gigi to that's what we're getting at.

3128
05:06:12.24 --> 05:06:13.24
Yep.

3129
05:06:13.24 --> 05:06:14.24
100%.

3130
05:06:14.24 --> 05:06:15.24
So, now I look into it.

3131
05:06:15.24 --> 05:06:17.24
If you don't do Gigi to, where are you wondering?

3132
05:06:17.24 --> 05:06:18.24
Some people are on the fence.

3133
05:06:18.24 --> 05:06:19.24
They're like, I can't hear you.

3134
05:06:19.24 --> 05:06:21.24
You can't hear me.

3135
05:06:21.24 --> 05:06:23.24
So, Gigi to, I can't.

3136
05:06:23.24 --> 05:06:25.24
Step out of that column.

3137
05:06:25.24 --> 05:06:25.24
Yeah.

3138
05:06:25.24 --> 05:06:27.24
Get right into Gigi to.

3139
05:06:27.24 --> 05:06:29.24
There was a guy who asked at the Australian monster.

3140
05:06:29.24 --> 05:06:31.24
He was like, it was one of the early questions.

3141
05:06:31.24 --> 05:06:33.24
He was like, oh, is there striking?

3142
05:06:33.24 --> 05:06:37.24
And I knew exactly when he met because he didn't know at all.

3143
05:06:37.24 --> 05:06:41.24
Like, you know, because when you talk about Gigi to, it's like, there's sort of three

3144
05:06:41.24 --> 05:06:45.24
maybe more kind of capacities that you kind of regard Gigi to.

3145
05:06:45.24 --> 05:06:51.24
So, the original in my, the more the most holistic way of looking at it is like a

3146
05:06:51.24 --> 05:06:55.24
Hoyst Gracie UFC one situation, where it's like a straight up fight.

3147
05:06:55.24 --> 05:06:59.24
You know, you submission holds positioning like what Gigi to is.

3148
05:06:59.24 --> 05:07:01.24
Sure, you can use strikes, but that's not what Gigi to is.

3149
05:07:01.24 --> 05:07:04.24
Just doesn't training striking, you know.

3150
05:07:04.24 --> 05:07:08.24
But you can strike in Gigi to kind of thing.

3151
05:07:08.24 --> 05:07:09.24
Right.

3152
05:07:09.24 --> 05:07:11.24
So he was asking, like, oh, yeah, can you strike?

3153
05:07:11.24 --> 05:07:14.24
So it's like, oh, well, it depends, you know.

3154
05:07:14.24 --> 05:07:18.24
So when you train Gigi to out of Gigi to school, typically no, even though some places

3155
05:07:18.24 --> 05:07:23.24
do offer training and striking in a Gigi to competition, sport Gigi to strike.

3156
05:07:23.24 --> 05:07:25.24
But that's just the rule.

3157
05:07:25.24 --> 05:07:26.24
That's just the rule.

3158
05:07:26.24 --> 05:07:30.24
So I'm saying, but then obviously in a self-defense situation, yeah, you do whatever you want.

3159
05:07:30.24 --> 05:07:31.24
Kind of thing.

3160
05:07:31.24 --> 05:07:35.24
But if you know Gigi to, you're going to have the advantage and that again,

3161
05:07:35.24 --> 05:07:36.24
is an understatement.

3162
05:07:36.24 --> 05:07:40.24
They're going to be striking you to, by the way, so it helps to know these sorts of things.

3163
05:07:40.24 --> 05:07:44.24
True. But at the end of the day, from a day to day standpoint,

3164
05:07:44.24 --> 05:07:53.24
Gigi to is an enjoyable and beneficial, another understatement thing to do for yourself and for the people around you.

3165
05:07:53.24 --> 05:07:55.24
Yeah, I agree.

3166
05:07:55.24 --> 05:07:59.24
And if you're going to be doing Gigi to which hopefully you are, you're going to need a Gigi.

3167
05:07:59.24 --> 05:08:00.24
Yes.

3168
05:08:00.24 --> 05:08:02.24
So we're going to need a rash guard.

3169
05:08:02.24 --> 05:08:03.24
Yes.

3170
05:08:03.24 --> 05:08:06.24
You're going to need the clothing uniform.

3171
05:08:06.24 --> 05:08:07.24
They uniform.

3172
05:08:07.24 --> 05:08:08.24
For the uniform.

3173
05:08:08.24 --> 05:08:09.24
Yeah.

3174
05:08:09.24 --> 05:08:10.24
Yeah.

3175
05:08:10.24 --> 05:08:10.24
Yeah.

3176
05:08:10.24 --> 05:08:11.24
Yeah.

3177
05:08:11.24 --> 05:08:12.24
Yeah.

3178
05:08:12.24 --> 05:08:13.24
Yeah.

3179
05:08:13.24 --> 05:08:14.24
I call it uniform for sure.

3180
05:08:14.24 --> 05:08:15.24
Yeah.

3181
05:08:15.24 --> 05:08:16.24
So where are we going to get the Gigi?

3182
05:08:16.24 --> 05:08:18.24
No one asked me that anymore.

3183
05:08:18.24 --> 05:08:19.24
No, they don't ask.

3184
05:08:19.24 --> 05:08:20.24
You know what?

3185
05:08:20.24 --> 05:08:21.24
Because they know everybody knows.

3186
05:08:21.24 --> 05:08:25.24
But for those of us that don't quite know yet, here, let me tell you, origin.

3187
05:08:25.24 --> 05:08:27.24
You can get an origin Gigi.

3188
05:08:27.24 --> 05:08:28.24
100%.

3189
05:08:28.24 --> 05:08:30.24
But an origin main.com is where you can get these things.

3190
05:08:30.24 --> 05:08:31.24
You can get origin Gigi.

3191
05:08:31.24 --> 05:08:33.24
You can get rash guards there as well.

3192
05:08:33.24 --> 05:08:35.24
You can also get jeans.

3193
05:08:35.24 --> 05:08:36.24
Yes.

3194
05:08:36.24 --> 05:08:38.24
But that you wear every single day.

3195
05:08:38.24 --> 05:08:39.24
Yeah.

3196
05:08:39.24 --> 05:08:41.24
And by the way, emergency situation.

3197
05:08:41.24 --> 05:08:42.24
Mm-hmm.

3198
05:08:42.24 --> 05:08:43.24
Something happens.

3199
05:08:43.24 --> 05:08:46.24
And you don't have a pair of shorts to do squats in.

3200
05:08:46.24 --> 05:08:47.24
Guess what you can do.

3201
05:08:47.24 --> 05:08:48.24
Where your origin jeans.

3202
05:08:48.24 --> 05:08:50.24
They got a little bit of flexible.

3203
05:08:50.24 --> 05:08:53.24
You can, you can, you can, you can do.

3204
05:08:53.24 --> 05:08:54.24
You can do.

3205
05:08:54.24 --> 05:08:57.24
Ask to grass squats in origin jeans.

3206
05:08:57.24 --> 05:08:58.24
All day long.

3207
05:08:58.24 --> 05:08:59.24
No factor.

3208
05:08:59.24 --> 05:09:00.24
Good.

3209
05:09:00.24 --> 05:09:01.24
No factor.

3210
05:09:01.24 --> 05:09:01.24
Yeah, man.

3211
05:09:01.24 --> 05:09:02.24
I mean, it's face.

3212
05:09:02.24 --> 05:09:03.24
That's what we kind of look for in that.

3213
05:09:03.24 --> 05:09:05.24
And they're good to go.

3214
05:09:05.24 --> 05:09:07.24
And of course, they're made in America.

3215
05:09:07.24 --> 05:09:08.24
100%.

3216
05:09:08.24 --> 05:09:12.24
So when you buy a pair of jeans, you are supporting freedom.

3217
05:09:12.24 --> 05:09:17.24
When you buy something from origin, you are supporting freedom and democracy in the world.

3218
05:09:17.24 --> 05:09:18.24
That's what you're doing.

3219
05:09:18.24 --> 05:09:20.24
So you might want to do it.

3220
05:09:20.24 --> 05:09:21.24
I want to do it.

3221
05:09:21.24 --> 05:09:23.24
Not to mention they are dope jeans.

3222
05:09:23.24 --> 05:09:24.24
If I'm wearing it.

3223
05:09:24.24 --> 05:09:25.24
Oh, no.

3224
05:09:25.24 --> 05:09:26.24
You mean from like a fashion perspective.

3225
05:09:26.24 --> 05:09:27.24
I can't judge that.

3226
05:09:27.24 --> 05:09:29.24
We'll just say from an aesthetic.

3227
05:09:29.24 --> 05:09:30.24
Right.

3228
05:09:30.24 --> 05:09:33.24
Like a 10 minute conversation with someone about.

3229
05:09:33.24 --> 05:09:34.24
Whether the jeans.

3230
05:09:34.24 --> 05:09:35.24
They were just they wouldn't even ask me.

3231
05:09:35.24 --> 05:09:42.24
They were just telling me that the jeans were quote fashionable and I was like, well, they're just jeans.

3232
05:09:42.24 --> 05:09:44.24
They're like, yeah, but I said, what's different about these?

3233
05:09:44.24 --> 05:09:46.24
I said, there's no like.

3234
05:09:46.24 --> 05:09:49.24
Remember like those jeans that were out for a while.

3235
05:09:49.24 --> 05:09:50.24
No.

3236
05:09:50.24 --> 05:09:50.24
No.

3237
05:09:50.24 --> 05:09:51.24
You know what I was saying?

3238
05:09:51.24 --> 05:09:52.24
No, they had like no.

3239
05:09:52.24 --> 05:09:54.24
They had like sewing all over the way.

3240
05:09:54.24 --> 05:09:55.24
Yeah.

3241
05:09:55.24 --> 05:09:55.24
Yeah.

3242
05:09:55.24 --> 05:09:58.24
And like ripping and whatever and so-and-up.

3243
05:09:58.24 --> 05:09:59.24
Rips and stuff like that.

3244
05:09:59.24 --> 05:10:00.24
Yeah.

3245
05:10:00.24 --> 05:10:01.24
It's not that.

3246
05:10:01.24 --> 05:10:02.24
Or didn't do that.

3247
05:10:02.24 --> 05:10:03.24
No, no, no.

3248
05:10:03.24 --> 05:10:04.24
They're a pair of blue jeans.

3249
05:10:04.24 --> 05:10:15.24
Here's what you'd be hard pressed to give me a fashion specific part of those jeans that is not fully there for function only.

3250
05:10:15.24 --> 05:10:16.24
Right.

3251
05:10:16.24 --> 05:10:17.24
Tell me one thing.

3252
05:10:17.24 --> 05:10:18.24
Tell me one thing.

3253
05:10:18.24 --> 05:10:19.24
I can't.

3254
05:10:19.24 --> 05:10:20.24
Because they're functional.

3255
05:10:20.24 --> 05:10:21.24
The here's the thing.

3256
05:10:21.24 --> 05:10:23.24
This is like Pete Roberts getting offended right now.

3257
05:10:23.24 --> 05:10:25.24
Because you know he's like, oh, guys, little fashion.

3258
05:10:25.24 --> 05:10:26.24
Yeah.

3259
05:10:26.24 --> 05:10:27.24
And a lot of things like it's kind of reverse.

3260
05:10:27.24 --> 05:10:28.24
Yoke.

3261
05:10:28.24 --> 05:10:29.24
You're reverse.

3262
05:10:29.24 --> 05:10:31.24
You're just functional.

3263
05:10:31.24 --> 05:10:33.24
I forget even when a Yoke, you explained to me.

3264
05:10:33.24 --> 05:10:34.24
Yeah.

3265
05:10:34.24 --> 05:10:35.24
Remember, but it was it was.

3266
05:10:35.24 --> 05:10:39.24
I don't look for the yoke shape or quality.

3267
05:10:39.24 --> 05:10:44.24
No one every time I pick up the jeans like I'm not like fascinated and just enamored by the Yoke.

3268
05:10:44.24 --> 05:10:45.24
Yeah.

3269
05:10:45.24 --> 05:10:46.24
I just put them on and they work in.

3270
05:10:46.24 --> 05:10:47.24
All right.

3271
05:10:47.24 --> 05:10:48.24
They functional.

3272
05:10:48.24 --> 05:10:49.24
They weren't functional.

3273
05:10:49.24 --> 05:10:50.24
There you go.

3274
05:10:50.24 --> 05:10:51.24
Thank you.

3275
05:10:51.24 --> 05:10:53.24
But when I see when they work, they got kind of look good.

3276
05:10:53.24 --> 05:10:57.24
Like my wife can't, you know, talk trash to me because I'm wearing grum.

3277
05:10:57.24 --> 05:10:59.24
Crum pudgins or dad jeans or whatever.

3278
05:10:59.24 --> 05:11:00.24
I don't even know what that means, bro.

3279
05:11:00.24 --> 05:11:01.24
Yeah.

3280
05:11:01.24 --> 05:11:02.24
Because I am a grandpa.

3281
05:11:02.24 --> 05:11:03.24
We have not really, but I'm a dad.

3282
05:11:03.24 --> 05:11:05.24
Nonetheless, you can be a grandpa and that's cool.

3283
05:11:05.24 --> 05:11:06.24
Dad is cool.

3284
05:11:06.24 --> 05:11:08.24
But if you have dad jeans, maybe that's cool.

3285
05:11:08.24 --> 05:11:12.24
If your wife is telling you that you haven't been to the like, I'm they're not attractive.

3286
05:11:12.24 --> 05:11:14.24
Turn my wife's not saying that.

3287
05:11:14.24 --> 05:11:15.24
Just saying they fake good.

3288
05:11:15.24 --> 05:11:18.24
So that's what I mean when I say they work.

3289
05:11:18.24 --> 05:11:21.24
So the jeans are Sarah Charles approved.

3290
05:11:21.24 --> 05:11:22.24
Yeah.

3291
05:11:22.24 --> 05:11:23.24
We'll go with that.

3292
05:11:23.24 --> 05:11:24.24
All right.

3293
05:11:24.24 --> 05:11:25.24
Anyway.

3294
05:11:25.24 --> 05:11:26.24
Yes.

3295
05:11:26.24 --> 05:11:27.24
All made in America.

3296
05:11:27.24 --> 05:11:28.24
All made in America.

3297
05:11:28.24 --> 05:11:29.24
Yeah.

3298
05:11:29.24 --> 05:11:30.24
It's not nothing.

3299
05:11:30.24 --> 05:11:32.24
What's that stuff that they plant in the ground?

3300
05:11:32.24 --> 05:11:33.24
And then it goes.

3301
05:11:33.24 --> 05:11:34.24
What is it called?

3302
05:11:34.24 --> 05:11:35.24
Cotton.

3303
05:11:35.24 --> 05:11:36.24
Cotton.

3304
05:11:36.24 --> 05:11:37.24
All right.

3305
05:11:37.24 --> 05:11:38.24
Thanks.

3306
05:11:38.24 --> 05:11:40.24

3307
05:11:40.24 --> 05:11:41.24
Don't forget about criminal.

3308
05:11:41.24 --> 05:11:42.24
Don't forget about discipline and discipline.

3309
05:11:42.24 --> 05:11:47.24
Go in the cans, which I'm drinking right now, which is legit.

05:12:00.24 --> 05:12:01.24

It has a bunch of protein in it.

3315
05:12:02.24 --> 05:12:03.24
Clean protein.

3316
05:12:03.24 --> 05:12:04.24
Yes.

3317
05:12:04.24 --> 05:12:06.24
Sure. There's no sugar.

3318
05:12:06.24 --> 05:12:07.24
Sure.

3319
05:12:07.24 --> 05:12:08.24
It tastes delicious.

3320
05:12:08.24 --> 05:12:09.24
It's dessert.

3321
05:12:09.24 --> 05:12:10.24
Yeah.

3322
05:12:10.24 --> 05:12:11.24

Bruce them up.

3328
05:12:17.24 --> 05:12:19.24
Get a brew on us that Aussies used to say.

3329
05:12:19.24 --> 05:12:20.24
Or the brits.

3330
05:12:20.24 --> 05:12:21.24
Hi.

3331
05:12:21.24 --> 05:12:22.24
Like out in the field.

3332
05:12:22.24 --> 05:12:23.24
Yeah.

3333
05:12:23.24 --> 05:12:24.24
On the field.

3334
05:12:24.24 --> 05:12:25.24
They're they're brewing up in the field.

3335
05:12:25.24 --> 05:12:27.24
Do the brits still put milk in tea?

3336
05:12:27.24 --> 05:12:27.24
Yes.

3337
05:12:27.24 --> 05:12:28.24
That's the thing, right?

3338
05:12:28.24 --> 05:12:29.24
These mybred does.

3339
05:12:29.24 --> 05:12:30.24
Yeah.

3340
05:12:30.24 --> 05:12:31.24
Yeah.

3341
05:12:31.24 --> 05:12:32.24
No, they absolutely put milk in tea.

3342
05:12:32.24 --> 05:12:33.24
I guess so.

3343
05:12:33.24 --> 05:12:35.24
Why would I have any of that in the field though?

3344
05:12:35.24 --> 05:12:37.24
Because they're not carrying milk with you in the field.

3345
05:12:37.24 --> 05:12:38.24
Maybe eat it.

3346
05:12:38.24 --> 05:12:39.24
I'll be eating milk.

3347
05:12:39.24 --> 05:12:40.24
Maybe.

3348
05:12:40.24 --> 05:12:41.24
Yeah.

3349
05:12:41.24 --> 05:12:42.24
I don't think it's that serious in the field.

3350
05:12:42.24 --> 05:12:43.24
But I dig it.

3351
05:12:43.24 --> 05:12:44.24
You know, I know it's not a phase.

3352
05:12:44.24 --> 05:12:46.24
Of course, it's still putting milk in the tea.

3353
05:12:46.24 --> 05:12:47.24
It's a real thing.

3354
05:12:47.24 --> 05:12:48.24
No, it's a real thing.

3355
05:12:48.24 --> 05:12:50.24
No phase over there.

3356
05:12:50.24 --> 05:12:51.24
Anyone.

3357
05:12:51.24 --> 05:12:52.24
Cool.

3358
05:12:52.24 --> 05:12:53.24

Jocco is a star.

3372

It's called Jocco's door.

3373
05:13:11.24 --> 05:13:12.24
And this is where we.

3374
05:13:12.24 --> 05:13:14.24
It's where we get.

3375
05:13:14.24 --> 05:13:16.24
Clothing items.

3376
05:13:16.24 --> 05:13:17.24
Displine equals freedom.

3377
05:13:17.24 --> 05:13:18.24
T-shirts, hats,

Defcore.

3382
05:13:23.24 --> 05:13:24.24
Stand for.

3383
05:13:24.24 --> 05:13:26.24
They get the death part.

3384
05:13:26.24 --> 05:13:27.24
They get the core part.

3385
05:13:27.24 --> 05:13:29.24
And I'll go into that at some point.

3386
05:13:29.24 --> 05:13:32.24
But let me just say that there's layers.

3387
05:13:32.24 --> 05:13:33.24
Yes.

3388
05:13:33.24 --> 05:13:34.24
There's some layers there.

3389
05:13:34.24 --> 05:13:35.24
And this is important.

3390
05:13:35.24 --> 05:13:36.24
Very important.

3391
05:13:36.24 --> 05:13:37.24
Yes.

3392
05:13:37.24 --> 05:13:38.24
And this is what I'm.

3393
05:13:38.24 --> 05:13:39.24
I'm.

3394
05:13:39.24 --> 05:13:40.24
I gather.

3395
05:13:40.24 --> 05:13:41.24
This is what I feel.

3396
05:13:41.24 --> 05:13:43.24
I feel like we all kind of know what that means.

3397
05:13:43.24 --> 05:13:45.24
I think people understand.

3398
05:13:45.24 --> 05:13:46.24
Yeah.

3399
05:13:46.24 --> 05:13:46.24
Understand.

3400
05:13:46.24 --> 05:13:48.24
From from a broad perspective.

3401
05:13:48.24 --> 05:13:49.24
What it means.

3402
05:13:49.24 --> 05:13:50.24
But then there's layers.

3403
05:13:50.24 --> 05:13:51.24
Right.

3404
05:13:51.24 --> 05:13:51.24
Right.

3405
05:13:51.24 --> 05:13:52.24
They.

3406
05:13:52.24 --> 05:13:53.24
Yeah.

3407
05:13:53.24 --> 05:13:54.24
And they're not specifically.

3408
05:13:54.24 --> 05:13:55.24
And not something else.

3409
05:13:55.24 --> 05:13:57.24
But that aside that I feel like we know.

3410
05:13:57.24 --> 05:13:59.24
Like we know we feel it.

3411
05:13:59.24 --> 05:14:00.24
Yep.

3412
05:14:00.24 --> 05:14:01.24
But anyway, yes.

You're kind of.

In the wild representing and they will.

They will check in with me.

3434
05:14:26.24 --> 05:14:27.24
Let me know later.

3435
05:14:27.24 --> 05:14:28.24

And yes.

3438
05:14:29.24 --> 05:14:35.24
Oh, so what I want to start doing is if I see someone in the wild and they come up to me,

3439
05:14:35.24 --> 05:14:36.24
want to start doing this.

3440
05:14:36.24 --> 05:14:38.24
Doing live Q and I get that person.

3441
05:14:38.24 --> 05:14:39.24
One question.

3442
05:14:39.24 --> 05:14:40.24
Cause everywhere, I go, you know,

3443
05:14:40.24 --> 05:14:42.24
people like hey, hey, what's up?

3444
05:14:42.24 --> 05:14:43.24
Talk like that.

3445
05:14:43.24 --> 05:14:46.24
But I want to start going, okay, give me your one question.

3446
05:14:46.24 --> 05:14:47.24
And do, right there.

3447
05:14:47.24 --> 05:14:48.24
Just let's do it.

3448
05:14:48.24 --> 05:14:51.24
What's the answer to the question, live on.

3449
05:14:51.24 --> 05:14:53.24
You call the brim.

3450
05:14:55.04 --> 05:14:57.84
Or you could flip it around and ask them a question.

3451
05:14:58.84 --> 05:15:01.16
Hmm, I don't know that might freak people out.

3452
05:15:01.36 --> 05:15:03.16
Yeah, that's what people in the spot.

3453
05:15:03.16 --> 05:15:03.96
Yeah, you can do that.

3454
05:15:03.96 --> 05:15:04.44
You're right.

3455
05:15:04.44 --> 05:15:05.28
You're completely wrong.

3456
05:15:05.28 --> 05:15:07.76
Some people would don't care, but some people would freak out.

3457
05:15:07.76 --> 05:15:08.44
Yeah.

3458
05:15:08.44 --> 05:15:09.24
So you don't want to?

3459
05:15:09.24 --> 05:15:10.44
Yeah, that's true.

3460
05:15:10.44 --> 05:15:11.44
I agree.

3461
05:15:11.44 --> 05:15:12.44
Low risk.

3462
05:15:12.44 --> 05:15:14.84
Anyway, yes, some more rash cards on there too, by the way.

3463
05:15:15.84 --> 05:15:17.04
Some cool ones.

3464
05:15:17.04 --> 05:15:21.04
Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on your stitcher.

3465
05:15:21.04 --> 05:15:23.88
iTunes, they get something.

3466
05:15:23.88 --> 05:15:24.88
It's important.

3467
05:15:24.88 --> 05:15:26.44
Yeah, you can use a review on there.

3468
05:15:26.44 --> 05:15:27.44
Yeah.

3469
05:15:27.44 --> 05:15:28.60
I read the reviews.

3470
05:15:28.60 --> 05:15:31.92
I haven't read the reviews all because sometimes the reviews are so good.

3471
05:15:31.92 --> 05:15:34.20
Like, and by good, I don't mean positive reviews.

3472
05:15:34.20 --> 05:15:35.04
I mean, they're funny.

3473
05:15:35.04 --> 05:15:36.20
I mean, you know what it is?

3474
05:15:36.20 --> 05:15:37.92
The reviews have layers.

3475
05:15:37.92 --> 05:15:39.44
The reviews have layers.

3476
05:15:39.44 --> 05:15:40.44
It's kind of worth.

3477
05:15:40.44 --> 05:15:42.28
I've read some of those before.

3478
05:15:42.28 --> 05:15:42.80
Yeah.

3479
05:15:42.80 --> 05:15:45.28
They're always good and they kind of crack me up.

3480
05:15:45.28 --> 05:15:47.44
So I appreciate that one.

3481
05:15:47.44 --> 05:15:49.60
Also, don't forget about the grounded podcast.

3482
05:15:49.60 --> 05:15:50.92
I uploaded another one by the way.

3483
05:15:50.92 --> 05:15:54.96
I saw that with one Jason Gardner.

3484
05:15:54.96 --> 05:15:59.24
And then the Warrior Kid Podcast, which will be released by Christmas.

3485
05:15:59.24 --> 05:16:00.24
Cool.

3486
05:16:00.24 --> 05:16:02.20
I'm going to get three possibly four done.

3487
05:16:02.20 --> 05:16:06.60
Because I know people are amped and another warrior, kids are out there going, hey,

3488
05:16:06.60 --> 05:16:07.92
what's wrong with Jocco?

3489
05:16:07.92 --> 05:16:08.92
What's wrong with Uncle Jake?

3490
05:16:08.92 --> 05:16:11.16
Like, can you put together another podcast?

3491
05:16:11.16 --> 05:16:13.08
I'll say you why.

3492
05:16:13.08 --> 05:16:14.80
Uncle Jake's out there working.

3493
05:16:14.80 --> 05:16:17.04
He's out there getting after it.

3494
05:16:17.04 --> 05:16:18.04
But he'll come back.

3495
05:16:18.04 --> 05:16:19.36
He'll record some more podcasts.

3496
05:16:19.36 --> 05:16:20.88
He's going to do it.

3497
05:16:20.88 --> 05:16:27.000
And don't forget about that Warrior Kid soap from IrishOx Ranch.com.

3498
05:16:27.000 --> 05:16:30.28
100% get some.

3499
05:16:30.28 --> 05:16:32.52
Warrior Kid up there, making soap.

3500
05:16:32.52 --> 05:16:35.80
And if you want to, then you should.

3501
05:16:35.80 --> 05:16:37.80
So that you can stay great.

3502
05:16:37.80 --> 05:16:41.16
I think it's also a YouTube channel.

3503
05:16:41.16 --> 05:16:42.16
Official.

3504
05:16:42.16 --> 05:16:44.32
It doesn't have the checkmark.

3505
05:16:44.32 --> 05:16:45.76
I think YouTube has checkmarks.

3506
05:16:45.76 --> 05:16:46.76
Oh, does it?

3507
05:16:46.76 --> 05:16:48.92
I think I'm pretty sure we don't rate the checkmark.

3508
05:16:48.92 --> 05:16:49.92
Wait.

3509
05:16:49.92 --> 05:16:50.92
Yeah.

3510
05:16:50.92 --> 05:16:52.32
Oh, I may be in a thing.

3511
05:16:52.32 --> 05:16:53.96
I don't think it does, bro.

3512
05:16:53.96 --> 05:16:54.96
No, I don't think it does.

3513
05:16:54.96 --> 05:16:55.96
No, I don't think it does.

3514
05:16:55.96 --> 05:16:57.24
Well, I'm going to look into it.

3515
05:16:57.24 --> 05:16:58.24
Look into it.

3516
05:16:58.24 --> 05:16:59.24
I'm going to look into it.

3517
05:16:59.24 --> 05:17:01.60
Now, the last checkmark, no checkmark, does it matter?

3518
05:17:01.60 --> 05:17:05.40
Jocco podcast does have an official YouTube channel.

3519
05:17:05.40 --> 05:17:07.28
It's just called Jocco podcast.

3520
05:17:07.28 --> 05:17:08.28
And, you know.

3521
05:17:08.28 --> 05:17:10.84
And we just released Mikey in the Dragons.

3522
05:17:10.84 --> 05:17:12.16
Full.

3523
05:17:12.16 --> 05:17:18.60
The entire thing, you know, drawings by John Bowie's act, Echo put together, we'll call it

3524
05:17:18.60 --> 05:17:25.84
dynamic video of the images and the lettering.

3525
05:17:25.84 --> 05:17:29.48
And yeah, so if you want to have your kids listen to Mikey in the Dragons, read

3526
05:17:29.48 --> 05:17:30.48
by Uncle Jake.

3527
05:17:30.48 --> 05:17:36.56
If you want to hear my accents, if you want to hear my seven year old boy voice, some

3528
05:17:36.56 --> 05:17:44.80
forget it from England or from Scotland or from Ireland or somewhere not America.

3529
05:17:44.80 --> 05:17:46.92
I heard that I was like, that's the sound good.

3530
05:17:46.92 --> 05:17:47.92
You know, it was good.

3531
05:17:47.92 --> 05:17:48.92
I liked it.

3532
05:17:48.92 --> 05:17:49.92
It kept me immersed in the story.

3533
05:17:49.92 --> 05:17:50.92
We'll put it in the way.

3534
05:17:50.92 --> 05:17:51.92
You seem to say.

3535
05:17:51.92 --> 05:17:55.76
I should have rehearsed that more or experimented more.

3536
05:17:55.76 --> 05:18:00.92
But I think I'd make up for it when I do the King's voice.

3537
05:18:00.92 --> 05:18:04.92
And when you put the reverberation on the King's voice, that makes it all kind of worthwhile.

3538
05:18:04.92 --> 05:18:06.12
I can deal with the kid.

3539
05:18:06.12 --> 05:18:11.24
Can you have used some like post production to raise my voice for the little kids'

3540
05:18:11.24 --> 05:18:12.24
voice or something?

3541
05:18:12.24 --> 05:18:13.24
Oh, like the tone?

3542
05:18:13.24 --> 05:18:14.24
Yeah.

3543
05:18:14.24 --> 05:18:15.24
Yeah, a pitch shift.

3544
05:18:15.24 --> 05:18:16.24
Yeah, that would have been nice.

3545
05:18:16.24 --> 05:18:17.24
It said it sounds like a job.

3546
05:18:17.24 --> 05:18:18.24
It's been a while.

3547
05:18:18.24 --> 05:18:22.76
It's been a year old kid that has been the war.

3548
05:18:22.76 --> 05:18:23.76
Exactly.

3549
05:18:23.76 --> 05:18:24.76
Very entertaining.

3550
05:18:24.76 --> 05:18:25.76
No, no.

3551
05:18:25.76 --> 05:18:27.88
It's essentially like an audio book with video.

3552
05:18:27.88 --> 05:18:29.42
Yeah, it's an audio book with video.

3553
05:18:29.42 --> 05:18:30.72
So check that out.

3554
05:18:30.72 --> 05:18:31.72
Good one.

3555
05:18:31.72 --> 05:18:33.64
Yes, it is on the YouTube channel.

3556
05:18:33.64 --> 05:18:35.76
And don't forget about psychological warfare.

3557
05:18:35.76 --> 05:18:36.76
Yes, sir.

3558
05:18:36.76 --> 05:18:37.76
Did I cut you off?

3559
05:18:37.76 --> 05:18:38.76
No.

3560
05:18:38.76 --> 05:18:39.76
We're going to talk about psychological warfare.

3561
05:18:39.76 --> 05:18:40.76
Yeah.

3562
05:18:40.76 --> 05:18:42.44
If you want to, the people who are going to like this are going to wake me up in the morning

3563
05:18:42.44 --> 05:18:45.32
or I wish I could talk to you when I want to eat a doughnut or I wish I would

3564
05:18:45.32 --> 05:18:47.52
talk to you when I don't want to work out.

3565
05:18:47.52 --> 05:18:48.52
Cool.

3566
05:18:48.52 --> 05:18:49.52
I will talk to you.

3567
05:18:49.52 --> 05:18:51.96
Get psychological warfare from iTunes, Google Play, MB3.

3568
05:18:51.96 --> 05:18:59.24

3570

Or whatever it is, note your notes, whatever.

3571
05:19:05.08 --> 05:19:06.40
Press play on that thing.

3572
05:19:06.40 --> 05:19:10.08
And you can listen to me tell you to put the doughnut down.

3573
05:19:10.08 --> 05:19:11.08
Sugar.

3574
05:19:11.08 --> 05:19:12.08
Sugar.

3575
05:19:12.08 --> 05:19:13.08
Sugar.

3576
05:19:13.08 --> 05:19:14.08
Sugar.

3577
05:19:14.08 --> 05:19:15.08
Sugar.

3578
05:19:15.08 --> 05:19:16.50
Dakota, Milietton microomaingrajian.

3579
05:19:16.50 --> 05:19:19.46
araqing somos movement project Formula flight contract through screen translation and

3580
05:19:19.46 --> 05:19:20.46
changing products.

3581
05:19:20.46 --> 05:19:21.66
I would also want say that support are also available to Koreans, we would be all

3582
05:19:21.66 --> 05:19:23.36
articles, YouTube your app page.

3583
05:19:23.36 --> 05:19:28.22
I would also want to share it with you much further to see if you have an

3584
05:19:28.22 --> 05:19:32.16
employee to support us or your neighborhood, to your home or to your home.

3585
05:19:32.16 --> 05:19:32.82
And it would also be a wonderful question for me.

3586
05:19:32.82 --> 05:19:35.22
They asked me to help someone who got helpful about it and if it's an easy

3587
05:19:35.22 --> 05:19:40.56
Iran dialect study, comment on him, bring it to your community and

3588
05:19:40.56 --> 05:19:41.56
blog.

3589
05:19:41.56 --> 05:19:45.48
That's all I'm going to say, get this book.

3590
05:19:45.48 --> 05:19:46.82
It's awesome.

3591
05:19:46.82 --> 05:19:50.04
On top of that, I have a new book coming out.

3592
05:19:50.04 --> 05:19:54.000
It's called Leadership Strategy and Tactics.

3593
05:19:54.000 --> 05:20:01.80
It has a ton of information that you can use to take and apply to your immediate life.

3594
05:20:01.80 --> 05:20:08.32
There's no pause between taking what's in this book and putting it in action.

3595
05:20:08.32 --> 05:20:10.20
You can do it right now.

3596
05:20:10.20 --> 05:20:11.36
It's also a reference book.

3597
05:20:11.36 --> 05:20:16.08
When you run into a little problem and you go, man, I wish Joko was here to tell me about

3598
05:20:16.08 --> 05:20:17.08
what I should do here.

3599
05:20:17.08 --> 05:20:18.24
No, no, no, you just open it up.

3600
05:20:18.24 --> 05:20:24.44
You just open it up, you check the index and you're like, oh, what should I do about emotional

3601
05:20:24.44 --> 05:20:25.44
arguments?

3602
05:20:25.44 --> 05:20:27.68
Oh, oh, there you go.

3603
05:20:27.68 --> 05:20:30.04
A emotional arguments page 59.

3604
05:20:30.04 --> 05:20:31.04
What should I do?

3605
05:20:31.04 --> 05:20:32.68
How can I improve my charisma?

3606
05:20:32.68 --> 05:20:34.72
Oh, page 65, 66 and 213.

3607
05:20:34.72 --> 05:20:36.96
Oh, what should I do in someone's complaints?

3608
05:20:36.96 --> 05:20:40.04
Oh, go to page 195 through 196.

3609
05:20:40.04 --> 05:20:41.04
What if I have a complex problem?

3610
05:20:41.04 --> 05:20:42.28
Oh, check page 65.

3611
05:20:42.28 --> 05:20:44.48
All these things are just in there.

3612
05:20:44.48 --> 05:20:46.12
So there you go.

3613
05:20:46.12 --> 05:20:50.44
Check out Leadership Strategy and Tactics and look.

3614
05:20:50.44 --> 05:20:52.96
We've been through this many times before.

3615
05:20:52.96 --> 05:20:56.96
And this is all my fault.

3616
05:20:56.96 --> 05:21:04.12
But we know that the publisher does not understand the podcast because I personally have

3617
05:21:04.12 --> 05:21:08.44
failed to explain to them that there's people listening to this podcast and that the people

3618
05:21:08.44 --> 05:21:11.16
listening to the podcast want to read the book.

3619
05:21:11.16 --> 05:21:16.000
And so when the book comes out, if you have an order to eat yet, they're going to run

3620
05:21:16.000 --> 05:21:17.64
out of books again.

3621
05:21:17.64 --> 05:21:18.64
Two problems with that.

3622
05:21:18.64 --> 05:21:20.60
Number one, you'll have to wait a long time to get it.

3623
05:21:20.60 --> 05:21:25.88
And what's even worse than that is you might end up with a second edition.

3624
05:21:25.88 --> 05:21:27.60
A second edition.

3625
05:21:27.60 --> 05:21:29.88
And you notice I can't say a dish when I say second.

3626
05:21:29.88 --> 05:21:31.32
No, no, no, no, no.

3627
05:21:31.32 --> 05:21:32.32
It's a second edition.

3628
05:21:32.32 --> 05:21:33.52
It's a totally different thing.

3629
05:21:33.52 --> 05:21:38.40
Now if you order now, you're going to get that first edition.

3630
05:21:38.40 --> 05:21:40.68
Which is what you want.

3631
05:21:40.68 --> 05:21:42.000
You don't want to be walking around.

3632
05:21:42.000 --> 05:21:43.56
So I wasn't in the game.

3633
05:21:43.56 --> 05:21:46.80
You might as well get, you know, some people get like a dish, putting cool freedom, tattoo,

3634
05:21:46.80 --> 05:21:47.80
or a good tattoo.

3635
05:21:47.80 --> 05:21:48.80
Sure.

3636
05:21:48.80 --> 05:21:49.80
Cool.

3637
05:21:49.80 --> 05:21:50.80
That's cool.

3638
05:21:50.80 --> 05:21:51.80
You're in the game.

3639
05:21:51.80 --> 05:21:56.80
If you get a second edition, you might as well just get a tattoo that says, wasn't in the game.

3640
05:21:56.80 --> 05:21:58.80
Got that second edition.

3641
05:21:58.80 --> 05:22:02.96
Hey, I just spent money on, I get books.

3642
05:22:02.96 --> 05:22:05.16
I try and get books that are first edition.

3643
05:22:05.16 --> 05:22:08.36
I'm like, well about face, I have a lot of copies of about face.

3644
05:22:08.36 --> 05:22:13.80
I think I have the close to 20 copies of about face.

3645
05:22:13.80 --> 05:22:14.96
They're on one bookshelf.

3646
05:22:14.96 --> 05:22:16.60
It's awesome.

3647
05:22:16.60 --> 05:22:22.28
But the little special ones, well, I've got a bunch of signed ones by hack.

3648
05:22:22.28 --> 05:22:24.80
I've got the advanced readers copy.

3649
05:22:24.80 --> 05:22:29.24
Sine by hack that was given to me at a master.

3650
05:22:29.24 --> 05:22:31.28
By guys, I can't, I thought you might like this.

3651
05:22:31.28 --> 05:22:34.88
I was like, even even, I don't even think he understood how much

3652
05:22:34.88 --> 05:22:35.88
you actually like.

3653
05:22:35.88 --> 05:22:36.88
Look, I'm a hard person to shop for.

3654
05:22:36.88 --> 05:22:41.88
I'm a hard person to give anything to.

3655
05:22:41.88 --> 05:22:43.88
My wife just doesn't get me anything.

3656
05:22:43.88 --> 05:22:47.28
Because she's like, whatever you want, you just get, I mean, I don't sit there and think

3657
05:22:47.28 --> 05:22:52.28
about, like, oh, well, I really wish, no, no, no, we've I want something I've got it.

3658
05:22:52.28 --> 05:22:53.52
My wife said, I'm not even getting anything.

3659
05:22:53.52 --> 05:22:55.16
We got cool, don't get me anything.

3660
05:22:55.16 --> 05:22:56.16
Just hang out.

3661
05:22:56.16 --> 05:22:57.16
It's all good.

3662
05:22:57.16 --> 05:22:58.88
What do you get for what do you want for Christmas?

3663
05:22:58.88 --> 05:23:00.04
Nothing.

3664
05:23:00.04 --> 05:23:05.92
This guy gave me that addition, the advanced readers copy, unedited addition, signed by

3665
05:23:05.92 --> 05:23:06.92
David Hackworth.

3666
05:23:06.92 --> 05:23:07.92
You know what that thing is?

3667
05:23:07.92 --> 05:23:09.24
In my gun safe.

3668
05:23:09.24 --> 05:23:11.64
It's in my gun to safe.

3669
05:23:11.64 --> 05:23:12.64
Dang.

3670
05:23:12.64 --> 05:23:15.32
Literally the best gift you know.

3671
05:23:15.32 --> 05:23:20.32
It's, I think it is, well, I can't think of another gift that's been better than that

3672
05:23:20.32 --> 05:23:21.32
in my life.

3673
05:23:21.32 --> 05:23:26.40
Right now, I mean, I'll have to review that statement because I'm really, I haven't

3674
05:23:26.40 --> 05:23:27.40
thought about it much.

3675
05:23:27.40 --> 05:23:33.000
But I mean, it's been a long time since I was needing something that I couldn't figure

3676
05:23:33.000 --> 05:23:34.000
out.

3677
05:23:34.000 --> 05:23:39.000
I mean, this was just, if I just right now just said, okay, I have unlimited money and

3678
05:23:39.000 --> 05:23:40.64
I want to get another one of those.

3679
05:23:40.64 --> 05:23:42.28
I don't think I could find one.

3680
05:23:42.28 --> 05:23:44.28
I don't think I could find one.

3681
05:23:44.28 --> 05:23:47.84
So anyways, I don't even know what we're talking about.

3682
05:23:47.84 --> 05:23:49.84
But I do know this.

3683
05:23:49.84 --> 05:23:52.12
First of all, that's the first edition.

3684
05:23:52.12 --> 05:23:53.12
You want that first.

3685
05:23:53.12 --> 05:23:58.84
Get on, get on the Amazon.

3686
05:23:58.84 --> 05:24:01.92
Let my publisher understand that we need to print more, they need to print more copies.

3687
05:24:01.92 --> 05:24:03.80
So otherwise you're going to be late.

3688
05:24:03.80 --> 05:24:05.20
You're going to get that second edition.

3689
05:24:05.20 --> 05:24:07.80
You saw in the video, I included the first edition.

3690
05:24:07.80 --> 05:24:08.80
Yes, I know.

3691
05:24:08.80 --> 05:24:13.20
Little, little, little message, little subliminal.

3692
05:24:13.20 --> 05:24:17.32
Maybe not so subliminal message to people to get some, get some of that first edition.

3693
05:24:17.32 --> 05:24:21.08
All right, also we have way the word you're kid three, where there's a will.

3694
05:24:21.08 --> 05:24:25.36
We have way the word your kid number one and number two, Mark's mission.

3695
05:24:25.36 --> 05:24:26.68
We have Mike in the Dragons.

3696
05:24:26.68 --> 05:24:27.96
Again, you know, you get the video.

3697
05:24:27.96 --> 05:24:28.96
You watch the video now.

3698
05:24:28.96 --> 05:24:31.40
That's for free YouTube.

3699
05:24:31.40 --> 05:24:33.36
Now teach your kid to read using that.

3700
05:24:33.36 --> 05:24:34.68
They can flip through the pages.

3701
05:24:34.68 --> 05:24:36.20
They can read along the pictures match.

3702
05:24:36.20 --> 05:24:40.68
It's like what an incredible way to teach a kid to read and teach them to be brave.

3703
05:24:40.68 --> 05:24:42.48
Oh, here's two things you can do.

3704
05:24:42.48 --> 05:24:46.48
Teach your kid to read and teach your kid to be brave.

3705
05:24:46.48 --> 05:24:47.84
You're welcome.

3706
05:24:47.84 --> 05:24:50.04
Merry Christmas.

3707
05:24:50.04 --> 05:24:51.04
Welcome to the English Freedom Manual.

3708
05:24:51.04 --> 05:24:52.04
This is another one.

3709
05:24:52.04 --> 05:24:56.40
This is one of those ones where you're like, hey, I'm not really sure what to get this

3710
05:24:56.40 --> 05:24:59.28
person for Christmas.

3711
05:24:59.28 --> 05:25:00.28
Cool.

3712
05:25:00.28 --> 05:25:02.68
Get them to this point equals freedom field manual.

3713
05:25:02.68 --> 05:25:08.68
It's the book that they can put anywhere and they read two pages a day, one page a day,

3714
05:25:08.68 --> 05:25:14.72
three pages a day and it keeps your damn mind straight.

3715
05:25:14.72 --> 05:25:16.12
It keeps your mind straight.

3716
05:25:16.12 --> 05:25:20.000
This is about the field manual.

3717
05:25:20.000 --> 05:25:21.000
The new one?

3718
05:25:21.000 --> 05:25:22.000
No, this one is freedom.

3719
05:25:22.000 --> 05:25:23.000
Yes.

3720
05:25:23.000 --> 05:25:24.000
My smile.

3721
05:25:24.000 --> 05:25:25.000
Yes.

3722
05:25:25.000 --> 05:25:26.60
Should you get it for someone who doesn't read?

3723
05:25:26.60 --> 05:25:28.000
You know how people are like, oh, you got me booked.

3724
05:25:28.000 --> 05:25:29.000
They don't really read books.

3725
05:25:29.000 --> 05:25:30.000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

3726
05:25:30.000 --> 05:25:32.04
Because it's like the book that they can read.

3727
05:25:32.04 --> 05:25:35.68
But what if they're like, hey, I'm not going to read it, but I do want it because it

3728
05:25:35.68 --> 05:25:36.68
looks cool.

3729
05:25:36.68 --> 05:25:38.88
And on top of it, in this face, this is a thing.

3730
05:25:38.88 --> 05:25:45.08
This is an actual thing where people will get it just to be like, yeah, I got it.

3731
05:25:45.08 --> 05:25:49.84
Some people will see that book on their table and be like, dang, you're, you know, here's

3732
05:25:49.84 --> 05:25:51.48
the thing.

3733
05:25:51.48 --> 05:25:56.12
Even a person that doesn't read, that doesn't like to read, that hasn't read a book

3734
05:25:56.12 --> 05:25:57.12
since high school.

3735
05:25:57.12 --> 05:25:58.80
Maybe they didn't even read a book and high school.

3736
05:25:58.80 --> 05:26:00.60
You get them the field manual.

3737
05:26:00.60 --> 05:26:01.60
It's a different thing.

3738
05:26:01.60 --> 05:26:02.60
It's not even reading.

3739
05:26:02.60 --> 05:26:03.60
Yeah.

3740
05:26:03.60 --> 05:26:04.60
It's like absorbing.

3741
05:26:04.60 --> 05:26:07.36
First of all, it's not, it's easy to read.

3742
05:26:07.36 --> 05:26:08.76
I mean, it's easy to read.

3743
05:26:08.76 --> 05:26:11.36
It's not like, and you don't have to read the whole thing at once and you don't have to,

3744
05:26:11.36 --> 05:26:12.76
you have to read it to understand what's going.

3745
05:26:12.76 --> 05:26:14.48
There's nothing that needs to be explained to you.

3746
05:26:14.48 --> 05:26:16.80
There's no like, hey, wait a second, who's this guy and what's going on?

3747
05:26:16.80 --> 05:26:17.80
No, it doesn't happen.

3748
05:26:17.80 --> 05:26:20.44
There's zero questions when you get done reading that book about anything.

3749
05:26:20.44 --> 05:26:21.92
You're like, I totally get it.

3750
05:26:21.92 --> 05:26:23.72
I know what I'm supposed to do.

3751
05:26:23.72 --> 05:26:26.36
That's the discipline you can read in field manual.

3752
05:26:26.36 --> 05:26:28.60
And that's what I tried to do with leadership strategy and tactics.

3753
05:26:28.60 --> 05:26:31.76
Hey, look, you don't have to ask me these questions anymore because boom, here it is.

3754
05:26:31.76 --> 05:26:32.76
Page 49.

3755
05:26:32.76 --> 05:26:35.000
Yeah, that's what I learned how to deal with that problem.

3756
05:26:35.000 --> 05:26:38.20
It's really effective in that, that new one, where it's like, you know, like, sometimes

3757
05:26:38.20 --> 05:26:40.68
everyone's in a great, well, rarely.

3758
05:26:40.68 --> 05:26:44.44
But it happens where I'll come in and I'll ask you like, hey, I do, I need to kind of

3759
05:26:44.44 --> 05:26:45.44
something advice.

3760
05:26:45.44 --> 05:26:47.88
I mean, this is literally the book for that.

3761
05:26:47.88 --> 05:26:50.92
Like, this is chocolate advice on all these various specific things.

3762
05:26:50.92 --> 05:26:56.68
And there's, it's surprisingly short book given how many things are in there.

3763
05:26:56.68 --> 05:26:59.20
Yes, because I didn't want to put any fluff in there.

3764
05:26:59.20 --> 05:27:00.20
There's no fluff in there.

3765
05:27:00.20 --> 05:27:01.20
No fluff.

3766
05:27:01.20 --> 05:27:04.04
I just wanted pragmatic solutions to problems.

3767
05:27:04.04 --> 05:27:05.28
I'm reading a book right now.

3768
05:27:05.28 --> 05:27:09.32
That's name will not be what you call it, remain remains to be.

3769
05:27:09.32 --> 05:27:10.32
Why why?

3770
05:27:10.32 --> 05:27:11.32
Whatever.

3771
05:27:11.32 --> 05:27:12.72
Anyway, I mean, the book and there's fluff in it.

3772
05:27:12.72 --> 05:27:14.32
I think it's normal to have.

3773
05:27:14.32 --> 05:27:15.32
You're going to talk smack.

3774
05:27:15.32 --> 05:27:16.68
I thought you're going to say something positive.

3775
05:27:16.68 --> 05:27:17.84
And I was like, oh, tell the book.

3776
05:27:17.84 --> 05:27:19.88
But if you're just saying there's a fluff in it.

3777
05:27:19.88 --> 05:27:20.88
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

3778
05:27:20.88 --> 05:27:24.80
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm throwing it under the bus for reason.

3779
05:27:24.80 --> 05:27:25.80
Okay.

3780
05:27:25.80 --> 05:27:27.08
You're still reading it though, apparently.

3781
05:27:27.08 --> 05:27:28.08
Oh, yeah.

3782
05:27:28.08 --> 05:27:29.08
It's a good book.

3783
05:27:29.08 --> 05:27:30.68
But they just happen to be fluff in it.

3784
05:27:30.68 --> 05:27:34.56
There's like three story examples for the little thing that they're talking to.

3785
05:27:34.56 --> 05:27:38.20
You know, there's a concept that they have, you know, stories, something like that.

3786
05:27:38.20 --> 05:27:39.20
There's like three stories.

3787
05:27:39.20 --> 05:27:40.20
Oh, yeah.

3788
05:27:40.20 --> 05:27:43.88
You know, kind of like reading the concept and about the concept is enough.

3789
05:27:43.88 --> 05:27:45.12
Like there's like three story.

3790
05:27:45.12 --> 05:27:47.68
So kind of extreme ownership and that caught me.

3791
05:27:47.68 --> 05:27:49.48
Leadership has two stories per concept.

3792
05:27:49.48 --> 05:27:50.48
Okay.

3793
05:27:50.48 --> 05:27:52.88
Well, you might be brushing up again.

3794
05:27:52.88 --> 05:27:55.12
The thing is those stories are called me fluff.

3795
05:27:55.12 --> 05:27:56.12
You're fluffy.

3796
05:27:56.12 --> 05:27:57.12
Good.

3797
05:27:57.12 --> 05:27:58.12
That's bad.

3798
05:27:58.12 --> 05:28:05.08
But to me, because in my opinion, we have a military story.

3799
05:28:05.08 --> 05:28:06.48
And then we have a civilian story.

3800
05:28:06.48 --> 05:28:07.48
And then you have the principal.

3801
05:28:07.48 --> 05:28:10.24
So you need to see the application in two different perspectives.

3802
05:28:10.24 --> 05:28:12.40
Well, that obviously makes sense.

3803
05:28:12.40 --> 05:28:14.68
I'm saying in this specific one.

3804
05:28:14.68 --> 05:28:18.72
And a part of this is me, too, by the way, like it's fluff because I feel like it's

3805
05:28:18.72 --> 05:28:19.72
fluff.

3806
05:28:19.72 --> 05:28:22.48
What if someone reads a concept in this particular book that I'm reading?

3807
05:28:22.48 --> 05:28:23.76
And they're like, I get it.

3808
05:28:23.76 --> 05:28:25.64
But I'd like to hear an example here.

3809
05:28:25.64 --> 05:28:27.40
The example, you're like, I get it.

3810
05:28:27.40 --> 05:28:29.44
But what about in the real world, right?

3811
05:28:29.44 --> 05:28:30.64
You know, maybe they need the three example.

3812
05:28:30.64 --> 05:28:31.64
I get it, man.

3813
05:28:31.64 --> 05:28:32.64
It's good.

3814
05:28:32.64 --> 05:28:33.84
But to me, I got it when they explained it.

3815
05:28:33.84 --> 05:28:35.16
And then I read a story of my co-incident.

3816
05:28:35.16 --> 05:28:37.04
Did you feel that way about extreme ownership?

3817
05:28:37.04 --> 05:28:42.04
Well, you know, I think that the application to business

3818
05:28:42.04 --> 05:28:47.68
part of it, since I was not in the military, made it landed harder with me.

3819
05:28:47.68 --> 05:28:48.68
I think.

3820
05:28:48.68 --> 05:28:53.08
So in my opinion, now, so that's your fluff rating for extreme ownership.

3821
05:28:53.08 --> 05:28:55.08
That's not a really fluff rating.

3822
05:28:55.08 --> 05:28:56.32
Because I don't think there's any fluff in those books.

3823
05:28:56.32 --> 05:28:57.68
I don't think so either.

3824
05:28:57.68 --> 05:29:03.64
I think there's, there's, we are explaining the concepts in a way that people can relate

3825
05:29:03.64 --> 05:29:05.000
to them and understand them.

3826
05:29:05.000 --> 05:29:06.000
Yes.

3827
05:29:06.000 --> 05:29:07.000
Agreed.

3828
05:29:07.000 --> 05:29:08.000
Okay.

3829
05:29:08.000 --> 05:29:10.36
So whoever this guy that wrote that at, maybe it's just that extra story.

3830
05:29:10.36 --> 05:29:13.72
Maybe life and I would have written a sports example.

3831
05:29:13.72 --> 05:29:17.68
What if we did military civilian and then random sports example?

3832
05:29:17.68 --> 05:29:19.76
If I would have been a bit much.

3833
05:29:19.76 --> 05:29:20.76
Okay, well, I see.

3834
05:29:20.76 --> 05:29:22.84
That's what that's what the, that's what you want.

3835
05:29:22.84 --> 05:29:23.84
Nothing can be added.

3836
05:29:23.84 --> 05:29:24.84
Nothing can be taken away.

3837
05:29:24.84 --> 05:29:25.84
There you go.

3838
05:29:25.84 --> 05:29:26.84
So this dichotomy of leadership.

3839
05:29:26.84 --> 05:29:27.84
It looks three-moner.

3840
05:29:27.84 --> 05:29:32.24
So the leadership strategy and tactics.

3841
05:29:32.24 --> 05:29:36.08
One, to me, has like way less.

3842
05:29:36.08 --> 05:29:37.08
Like way less.

3843
05:29:37.08 --> 05:29:40.88
That's where you, I understand the concept and I'm like, okay.

3844
05:29:40.88 --> 05:29:44.24
And when there's a story, when there's like an example, whatever used in action and whatever,

3845
05:29:44.24 --> 05:29:45.64
I'm like, cool, good.

3846
05:29:45.64 --> 05:29:48.12
I got it and then you're just moving on.

3847
05:29:48.12 --> 05:29:50.72
You're not like, okay, I gotta read like yet another one.

3848
05:29:50.72 --> 05:29:51.72
Yet another one.

3849
05:29:51.72 --> 05:29:53.72
I get it, man.

3850
05:29:53.72 --> 05:29:57.12
Yeah, I'm looking at like some of the chapters in here are two pages long.

3851
05:29:57.12 --> 05:29:59.72
I'm looking for one of the ones that's like one page long.

3852
05:29:59.72 --> 05:30:03.76
Because there are, there's some that are, hey, it doesn't take a bunch of information.

3853
05:30:03.76 --> 05:30:04.76
Yes.

3854
05:30:04.76 --> 05:30:05.76
Don't dig in.

3855
05:30:05.76 --> 05:30:10.52
You know, like, these are straightforward.

3856
05:30:10.52 --> 05:30:12.52
So I'm gonna take a little bit more time.

3857
05:30:12.52 --> 05:30:19.52
But I actually give pragmatic like how to actually say something to someone.

3858
05:30:19.52 --> 05:30:20.92
Like don't say this.

3859
05:30:20.92 --> 05:30:24.44
Because it's gonna offend them and they're not gonna listen to you say this.

3860
05:30:24.44 --> 05:30:28.88
Because it'll win them over and they'll start to listen to what you have to say and then

3861
05:30:28.88 --> 05:30:30.40
you'll make a positive influence.

3862
05:30:30.40 --> 05:30:31.40
Yeah.

3863
05:30:31.40 --> 05:30:35.28
Give that level of detail of leadership instruction.

3864
05:30:35.28 --> 05:30:36.44
So that's that.

3865
05:30:36.44 --> 05:30:40.92
And leadership strategy and tactics field manual, FM, zero, two.

3866
05:30:40.92 --> 05:30:45.16
dichotomy leadership, extreme ownership, all those books get them.

3867
05:30:45.16 --> 05:30:48.92
On top of that, we have an echelon front, which is our leadership consultancy.

3868
05:30:48.92 --> 05:30:50.52
We solve problems through leadership.

3869
05:30:50.52 --> 05:30:54.88
Go to echelonfront.com if you want us to come and help your business team or organization

3870
05:30:54.88 --> 05:30:56.88
get better at leading.

3871
05:30:56.88 --> 05:31:00.28
And once you get better leading, you get better at everything across the board.

3872
05:31:00.28 --> 05:31:09.80
The FM lines are online training program because I, me, the team at echelon front, we can't

3873
05:31:09.80 --> 05:31:12.000
always train everyone all the time.

3874
05:31:12.000 --> 05:31:13.36
We don't have the capacity.

3875
05:31:13.36 --> 05:31:18.28
So we decided to make an online training program interactive.

3876
05:31:18.28 --> 05:31:20.64
What's another word to describe?

3877
05:31:20.64 --> 05:31:22.12
It's not just interactive.

3878
05:31:22.12 --> 05:31:23.92
It's immersive.

3879
05:31:23.92 --> 05:31:29.08
So you're gonna go into scenarios in their and solve leadership problems and then get critiqued

3880
05:31:29.08 --> 05:31:30.08
on how you did.

3881
05:31:30.08 --> 05:31:36.12
So it's the most advanced form of online learning.

3882
05:31:36.12 --> 05:31:40.000
Go to eFonline.com to check that out.

3883
05:31:40.000 --> 05:31:46.40
And then we have eF Overwatch and EF Legion.

3884
05:31:46.40 --> 05:31:48.76
So these are two.

3885
05:31:48.76 --> 05:31:59.12
These are two businesses that we've started to take military personnel and get them into civilian

3886
05:31:59.12 --> 05:31:59.96
jobs.

3887
05:31:59.96 --> 05:32:06.32
Where they can use their leadership skills in the civilian sector and put positive influence

3888
05:32:06.32 --> 05:32:11.36
into companies because life, me and the rest of the echelon front team get asked all the

3889
05:32:11.36 --> 05:32:12.36
time.

3890
05:32:12.36 --> 05:32:14.76
Hey, I really love what you guys did for us.

3891
05:32:14.76 --> 05:32:17.56
But where can we hire people that know what you know?

3892
05:32:17.56 --> 05:32:19.40
It's like, I'll tell you where.

3893
05:32:19.40 --> 05:32:22.56
EF Overwatch and EF Legion.

3894
05:32:22.56 --> 05:32:24.84
So go to eF Overwatch.com or eFleagent.com.

3895
05:32:24.84 --> 05:32:31.88
Whether you're a military person getting out or you're a company that needs solid people

3896
05:32:31.88 --> 05:32:35.12
that understand extreme ownership that understand the dichotomy leadership that understand

3897
05:32:35.12 --> 05:32:37.20
the principles we talk about.

3898
05:32:37.20 --> 05:32:38.20
That's where you get them.

3899
05:32:38.20 --> 05:32:39.20
You need leadership at your team.

3900
05:32:39.20 --> 05:32:40.20
Go to eF Overwatch.

3901
05:32:40.20 --> 05:32:42.76
Go to eFleagent.com.

3902
05:32:42.76 --> 05:32:44.32
And we also have musters coming up.

3903
05:32:44.32 --> 05:32:45.88
We're gonna announce the date soon.

3904
05:32:45.88 --> 05:32:47.32
But that is a live event.

3905
05:32:47.32 --> 05:32:52.04
If you go to extremeownership.com and check those out.

3906
05:32:52.04 --> 05:32:56.08
You can come see the entire echelon front team.

3907
05:32:56.08 --> 05:33:02.32
And if you still want to communicate with us even after listening to hundreds and hundreds

3908
05:33:02.32 --> 05:33:06.04
and hundreds of hours of this podcast, you can do it.

3909
05:33:06.04 --> 05:33:08.60
We are on the interwebs.

3910
05:33:08.60 --> 05:33:16.44
Kyle Carpenter is on Facebook at William Kyle Carpenter and he's on Instagram and Twitter

3911
05:33:16.44 --> 05:33:25.72
at chicks, dig scars, CHIKS, dig scars.

3912
05:33:25.72 --> 05:33:29.000
And on the interwebs, Kyle Carpenter.

3913
05:33:29.000 --> 05:33:32.16
Sorry, William Kyle Carpenter.com.

3914
05:33:32.16 --> 05:33:38.68
And of course, we are also on the interwebs on Twitter, Instagram and on that fish.

3915
05:33:38.68 --> 05:33:47.32
And I am at Jacob, William, and once again, thanks to Kyle Carpenter for joining us here

3916
05:33:47.32 --> 05:33:56.24
today and for passing on the lessons that he was taught through pain and through suffering

3917
05:33:56.24 --> 05:34:02.40
and through leadership and brotherhood and through faith and through family.

3918
05:34:02.40 --> 05:34:07.44
And it's an honor to have to be able to talk to these heroes and to the rest of those

3919
05:34:07.44 --> 05:34:14.36
men and women that have worn the cloth of the nation.

3920
05:34:14.36 --> 05:34:16.44
And that currently do so.

3921
05:34:16.44 --> 05:34:21.40
Thank you for keeping evil at bay around the world and to our police and law enforcement

3922
05:34:21.40 --> 05:34:26.44
and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border

3923
05:34:26.44 --> 05:34:31.44
patrol and secret service and all the first responders out there.

3924
05:34:31.44 --> 05:34:36.88
Thank you for what you do to protect us and keep us safe here at home.

3925
05:34:36.88 --> 05:34:42.24
We are grateful for your service as well.

3926
05:34:42.24 --> 05:34:54.88
And everyone else out there, the root word of motivate is modus and it means move and that's

3927
05:34:54.88 --> 05:34:58.96
what you need to do.

3928
05:34:58.96 --> 05:35:02.72
Stang motivated means keep moving.

3929
05:35:02.72 --> 05:35:10.20
And things are bad, don't stop, don't let up, don't allow yourself to give in.

3930
05:35:10.20 --> 05:35:19.04
Instead put your head down, put one foot in front of the other, keep moving and keep

3931
05:35:19.04 --> 05:35:22.56
getting after it.

3932
05:35:22.56 --> 05:35:28.000
And until next time, this is echo and jocco.

3933
05:35:28.000 --> 05:35:49.88
All in the world enjoy it.
