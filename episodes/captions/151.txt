[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 151 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:05] Good evening, I go. Good evening. And we haven't done a Q&A for a while and we're
[00:00:14] going to roll into a Q&A and normally quite frankly, normally the Q&A is when we
[00:00:22] show up for the Q&A is there's a little bit of a different atmosphere. Well, say, right?
[00:00:27] We're a little bit of levity in the room. We're not going to talk about war. We're
[00:00:32] not going to be reading about men being wounded or killed. We're not going to be reading
[00:00:36] about some atrocity. And here and what people go through, we're going to be answering
[00:00:39] questions. And there's a little bit more just light-heartedness to the whole thing,
[00:00:45] usually. Sometimes it goes a little bit one way or the other. But this is, there's just a
[00:00:51] little bit of a different situation in the recording room right now. Because we just did a,
[00:00:56] and this is kind of surprising. Because we just did a war your kid podcast. And in the
[00:01:01] war your kid podcast, I answer questions from kids for Uncle Jake. And those are all, you
[00:01:08] know, kind of just little neat little kid questions. Hey, our cheeseburgers, good for you.
[00:01:15] And what do I do when I'm nervous that it's a Jockel tournament? And what do I do when I
[00:01:19] can't remember how to spell Mississippi? You know, just like these nice little kid
[00:01:24] questions and their fun. And yet, you know, I treat them seriously because kids have serious
[00:01:30] questions. And when you're a little kid, those are real problems. Those aren't, we laugh at them.
[00:01:33] Now you're laughing at them. No. Like, well, the Mississippi one, right? You're a real
[00:01:37] laughing at the kids, the issues. But then what I started doing a little while ago is I started telling
[00:01:42] these stories from the perspective of Uncle Jake when Uncle Jake was a kid. And some of those
[00:01:49] are a little bit more, they're a little bit more serious, but there's always a very big lesson
[00:01:52] if you learned because my goal with the stories from Uncle Jake is that kids can end up
[00:01:58] understanding how Uncle Jake kind of formulated his values as a man. And we've talked about a bunch
[00:02:06] of different ones of those. But anyways, the one that I did today and what's interesting is all these
[00:02:12] stories are kind of based on their based loosely around around things that I've experienced. And this
[00:02:19] is very, some of them very loosely, some of them not so loose on things that I've actually
[00:02:24] experienced things that I went through because I'm not Uncle Jake. But sure, I have some similar
[00:02:29] experiences that Uncle Jake has had along the way. And anyways, today I wanted to make the point
[00:02:35] to kids that the decisions that they make in their life are they have a big impact, right? And if
[00:02:42] you make little decisions when you're a kid, you start making bad decisions when you're a little
[00:02:46] kid, those bad decisions eventually add up. And if you make good decisions, those decisions will add
[00:02:52] up and you'll in the one case you'll end up with good things. If you make good decisions, if you
[00:02:56] make bad decisions, you'll end up in a bad situation. And I told this story from Uncle Jake's perspective
[00:03:01] about Uncle Jake's best friend when he was grown up and it was a kid named Jeff and they were
[00:03:07] best friends. They did everything together and they they played and they did practical jokes and they
[00:03:11] laughed an out of great time. And eventually Jeff starts making some bad decisions. He gets in trouble
[00:03:16] in class and he gets in more trouble than he gets suspended from recess and just and then the next thing
[00:03:20] you know, he starts really going down a bad path and starts using drugs in alcohol and eventually
[00:03:29] and again, this is a long, this is not a long story, but it's probably takes about 10 minutes to
[00:03:33] tell on the podcast on the warrior kid podcast and then eventually I leave high school, we graduate
[00:03:41] from high school and I kind of talk about seeing him and this is what's true like so this is true.
[00:03:46] So this is based on true story. I had a best friend when I was a kid. His name was Jeff. He was an
[00:03:49] awesome kid. He was funny and what he's one of those kids, I've talked about this before like
[00:03:54] some kids they have a little spark to him and it's not a lot. It's very few kids. They have this
[00:04:01] little spark. They've got this little thing about them that you go okay that person has something.
[00:04:05] Now that spark doesn't guarantee anything. In fact that spark can be a problem because that spark
[00:04:12] can catch fire and it can be an uncontrollable fire or it can be a fire that can be used to fuel and
[00:04:18] grow and create awesome things and you don't really know, you can't really control it. That
[00:04:23] person has to have control of that spark. Well Jeff was one of those kids that had like this
[00:04:27] spark. He was charismatic. He was funny. He was smart. He was a witty. He was courageous but he just
[00:04:34] for whatever reason had like a little spin to him that didn't mind getting in trouble. It's almost
[00:04:39] like an attitude like hey these guys can't hold me down and so you know when we were in fifth grade
[00:04:47] it was actually in fifth grade where we sat next to each other every day and we would start you know
[00:04:51] we would just hang out all the time and laugh and eventually he started getting in trouble and I
[00:04:57] didn't right and I would get in some trouble but he would cross the line and he'd cross the line
[00:05:01] to where all of a sudden you know he would get it sent to the principal's office and be that kind of
[00:05:07] trouble. One level above that kind of trouble I would get in which is like hey
[00:05:12] get yelled at you got to be quiet. Hey you know you go sit in the corner those things I got
[00:05:17] but I didn't cross the line which is hey I'm not I'm out of control in the class. I'm so disruptive
[00:05:23] that you got to get me out of class I never crossed that line. He started crossing that line and
[00:05:29] eventually you know like and I told in the story you know he started using drugs and I'll call
[00:05:34] and I thought about it. What do I want to talk about drugs now call in the warrior kid podcast
[00:05:38] and then I thought to myself yes I do because if you don't think kids here about drugs now call
[00:05:42] right now when they're seven years old eight years old nine years old you're wrong drugs are out there
[00:05:48] it's a different world and you might as well tell them when they're young that these things are
[00:05:52] problematic well with Jeff you know Jeff went down the path of starting you know smoke and
[00:05:58] drink and and all that stuff doing drugs and I didn't I you know he started getting into
[00:06:04] that kind of thing I started getting into like hardcore music and being like disciplined and
[00:06:09] all that stuff which again and I call it what you want call to trend call it me conforming to something
[00:06:16] whatever you want to call it but that's what I did that's what I got into I related to it let me
[00:06:19] put it to that way so eventually Jeff becomes like a burnout you know what I mean he he becomes
[00:06:26] yeah like a burnout you know he cut classes and he you know just kind of went down that spiral
[00:06:33] and the weird thing is we were such good friends when were your kids at it we didn't
[00:06:36] not like each other anymore you know I didn't like have a falling out with them we just we just
[00:06:42] went our separate ways and so when I would see him in school I'd seem in the hallway you
[00:06:48] I'd see him in town you know we were talk and you could see I could see in his eyes like in his eyes
[00:06:55] like he knew he was going in the wrong direction and we would still laugh and we would still have
[00:07:00] a good time we would joke about things and then we'd we'd walk away from each other and he'd keep
[00:07:06] kept going down the path he was going down and I kept going down the path I was going on and as time
[00:07:11] went by you know he just was a complete burnout I thought I don't even remember if he graduated high
[00:07:16] school or not I graduated high school and I joined the Navy and you know I was going to go try and
[00:07:23] be a seal that was my big big goal right and he was going to do whatever he was going to do
[00:07:29] and the last time I saw him again like I remember I saw him and it was like in my mind and it
[00:07:36] wasn't quite mature enough to really recognize what I saw like at the time but as I look back
[00:07:43] on it was like there was like this element of sadness for him seeing that I was going I was like
[00:07:51] for lack of a better word like getting away right I was going to go I was going to go do something
[00:07:56] right and he was going to not and you could see that and at this point like I don't even know if
[00:08:01] he could have gotten the military he'd been quite a bit of trouble and had used a lot of drugs and
[00:08:05] I don't even know if he could have gotten in the military at this point so and but when we were
[00:08:10] little kids mind you we were running around playing BB gun wars and you know setting up
[00:08:15] forts and running around and came off was out fits you know that's what we were doing so it's
[00:08:20] like I was going to do that for real and he was going to keep doing what he was doing which was
[00:08:23] not good stuff and so when I saw him for the last time you know like we shook hands and again like
[00:08:31] I could see in his eyes this this element of sadness that he was doing what his life had gone
[00:08:40] in this direction and my life had gone in this other direction and he was I don't even want to
[00:08:45] use the term jealous because I don't think he was jealous he wasn't jealous at all he was to absolutely
[00:08:48] he was actually like kind of proud you could see in his eyes like man that's awesome and he said
[00:08:54] like good luck you know and we shook hands and it broke hugged and then I then I just you know
[00:08:59] I left it during the Navy and went to boot camp and and I remember I was in the seal training
[00:09:05] and I was probably a month or two in the seal training and I talked to my mom and
[00:09:12] she told me that if this guy this guy Jeff would been my best friend from probably first grade through
[00:09:18] like fifth grade and then like I said it separated but he killed himself and 19 years old killed himself
[00:09:27] and so in the in the story that Uncle Jake tells I don't tell that part I don't talk about suicide
[00:09:32] but I just say that he died and he died from drugs now call which indirectly is true
[00:09:39] you know that's what killed him is that he was doing drugs and drinking and he wasn't making
[00:09:43] clear decisions and went down that path of depression and ended up killing himself and
[00:09:50] and I remember going you know I was going through seal training so I was you know definitely
[00:09:55] shocked and and saddened by it and I had to do work and it was one of those things but as I
[00:10:01] looked back on it like these were just little tiny decisions like I made a decision he made a decision
[00:10:08] he made a decision I made a positive decision about something he made a negative decision
[00:10:13] I made a good decision he made a bad decision these aren't huge decisions that I'm talking about
[00:10:17] but it was these little tiny decisions that added up over time and I think a lot of times
[00:10:24] kids they don't recognize that they don't recognize that these little I mean sure if you make a
[00:10:28] one big bad decision you go drinking and driving you're right you can you can kill yourself
[00:10:32] you can kill someone else you can ruin your whole life and one bad decision but where did that
[00:10:37] one bad decision came from it came from a bunch of bad decisions it came from hanging around
[00:10:40] with the bad people it came with starting to drink in the first place it came with even having the
[00:10:44] attitude that I can get away with stuff like there's a lot of little bad decisions that led up
[00:10:47] to this one bad big bad decision that actually ends up putting you in a bad way so that's the story
[00:10:56] that I just told on the warrior kid podcast and again I know it's kind of a heavy story
[00:11:02] in fact it's a very heavy story and that's another thing with like as I said to myself well
[00:11:07] should I talk about should I say that he ended up in jail or something like that
[00:11:14] and I said to myself no like this is the reality of life and if kids are not taught the
[00:11:21] reality of life again you're not trying to smack them in the face with it I'm not trying to
[00:11:26] to make them paranoid you know and that's kind of why I thought the suicide part was a step too far
[00:11:32] but you know it's like in Mikey and the dragons I talk about how there's dragons that are ready to kill
[00:11:40] and luckily you know I'm publishing I own the publishing company that's making this book because
[00:11:45] a lot of my editors probably wouldn't like to hear that a normal children's editor doesn't want to
[00:11:53] hear killing right and as and and also in the book the the king dies right the the king is dead
[00:12:00] and he's there's a funeral form and that's another thing like well do you really want to talk
[00:12:07] about that with little kids and as I asked myself that question for the first time I answered it in like a
[00:12:12] milliseconds with there's kids out there whose dad dies when they're five years old whose mom dies
[00:12:18] when they're seven years old whose grandma dies who's dog dies like death is part of life
[00:12:23] and to pretend that it doesn't exist and hope that your kids are just going to one day
[00:12:27] figure it out that's not the right thing to do they should understand it and so the the last part
[00:12:34] about this thing about Jeff was you know again he had this spark he was funny and he was just a really
[00:12:41] good awesome guy and I when I got done you know what I did I did like the typical
[00:12:49] whatever 11 o'clock at night sitting at the computer thing when I got done writing this thing
[00:12:55] and I just googled him I just googled him and just googled his name is full name and
[00:13:02] it was the weirdest thing because when I googled him there was nothing there was nothing
[00:13:10] no nothing not a name you couldn't his name no obituary no nothing just nothing
[00:13:16] and that kind of shook me up a little bit and the way it shakes me up is it shakes me up in the fact that
[00:13:28] that guy had more intelligence than me he had more talent than me he was more charismatic than me
[00:13:35] he had all these things that were better than me and yet google which I don't know if you ever
[00:13:44] googled like as I google a lot of stuff all the time because I google you know people that
[00:13:47] were in the military I google authors poets people that wrote some random like I'll find online
[00:13:55] some letter from some Lance corporal in World War II I'll google that person and guess what that
[00:14:00] person will there'll be article about them there'll be there'll be his obituary about what he did with
[00:14:05] his life and that's that's what it was wife and his wife died in 19 you know 68 and she had done
[00:14:11] and so you can get so much information about just anyone anyone and so I googled my friend Jeff
[00:14:19] and there's nothing nothing and that's a person that Jeff had he gone down the right path
[00:14:29] he would have left a giant mark on the world and would have done a lot of positive things
[00:14:33] and done beautiful things in the world and to think that it's all gone and it's all lost
[00:14:39] it's lost and there's not a damn thing about him so teacher kids to make the right decisions
[00:14:46] is what I'm saying yeah so so much for the like I said so much for the levity of the of the
[00:14:56] situation or of the podcast yeah I mean yes crazy how like you know obviously I didn't know Jeff
[00:15:06] but like how you say you're talking earlier how you know if you would have made maybe even three
[00:15:13] three good decisions you know because like this problem like drugs and alcohol and stuff like that
[00:15:18] as an individual problem that's not the maker or the breaker right there it's like everything put
[00:15:23] together you know there's people who are successful that may struggle with drugs and alcohol even
[00:15:27] for a little bit for a long time on going like you know you don't have to die you know if you
[00:15:36] make the decision to do the mistake in my opinion but to do drugs and drink alcohol you know or have
[00:15:43] that kind of hold you back or whatever you don't have to die from that it's like everything you know
[00:15:47] and he could have been potentially like massively successful you know just because of decisions
[00:15:56] that's that's the horrible thing about it is you just see the waste of human potential I guess
[00:16:01] that's to me is the this is a horrible thing and and I got these great memories like I got them right now
[00:16:07] I can remember doing things with him and and when you're with someone like that and you're almost
[00:16:15] like a spectator to their life like you're get to watch him you get to go like wow look at what
[00:16:21] he's doing this is crazy wow look at that look how funny he is you get to be a spectator and
[00:16:27] you appreciate I did I appreciate it and right now I look back and I think about how funny and
[00:16:32] you know I think about any random you know stand up comedian or someone on a Saturday night
[00:16:39] live or something like that and it's like yeah I know he would have been awesome on that show
[00:16:42] you've been hilarious on that show but never gonna happen it's not doesn't exist and
[00:16:49] yeah so so those little decisions that people make and that kids make especially you know it's
[00:16:57] weird to use when you're 19 years old think about think about how much you thought you knew when you
[00:17:02] were 19 and how much you actually know knew when you were 19 it's it's it's a pathetic it's
[00:17:09] you know so little when you're 19 you know so little when you're 19 yeah
[00:17:15] man I feel like you kind of know it well I don't know people different but man even
[00:17:22] 29 for sure I feel like it and I know I every five years that you look back you realize
[00:17:29] that you didn't know anything five years ago yeah and maybe someone will chime in and tell me
[00:17:33] that when you're 72 you feel pretty good about what you know but I don't think so I don't think so
[00:17:40] I think it's just always constantly looking back five years and think to yourself and you know I
[00:17:45] said before I was like I think when you get to be at some point it's some some decade along there 35 40
[00:17:51] you at least say I know I don't know everything and that is like the beginning of
[00:17:59] knowing something because when you're like you like you said when you're 19 you know you think you
[00:18:03] know everything when you're 23 you think you know everything when you're 26 you think you know everything
[00:18:07] when you're 31 you still think you know everything it's not until you actually look up maybe that's
[00:18:14] 35 maybe that's 37 maybe some people get it younger where they realize you know what I don't know
[00:18:18] everything and I need to learn more so there you go you're in a learning more yeah Q&A
[00:18:28] the people have some questions let's see if jockel as the answers I don't I don't necessarily have the
[00:18:36] answers the no but I have I will be able to give my assessment sure I will say this and I just
[00:18:43] got done telling Pete this sure yesterday and I probably have told you this before if I ever tell you
[00:18:50] I know something 100% then it's factually true but I do that so rarely it's very rare that I say hey
[00:19:01] here's the answer I probably do that I do that very very seldom if you hear me say that
[00:19:09] go with it it's correct you know barely hear me you probably you may have never heard me say that
[00:19:15] up until this point nothing I can't remember yeah I very rarely will say hey look I know this
[00:19:20] 100% I used to say it once every maybe twice every six months like when I was in the two teams
[00:19:26] I would every once in a while I'd have to say listen man I'm telling you this is how you want to do this
[00:19:32] you you this is how you should do this I'm telling you you do it this way very seldom most of
[00:19:38] times I look this is what I think you should do but it's your decision you can do what you want
[00:19:44] all right well so I will give my assessment I'll give my best possible and the other thing is these
[00:19:49] questions are there's not a lot of detail to them often or there's a ton of detail but even
[00:19:54] a ton of detail isn't like let me talk oh you got a problem with your boss I need to meet your
[00:19:58] boss I need to talk to him you interact with him every day I don't yeah so you need to kind of
[00:20:03] you need to kind of modulate and and hone the answers to your particular scenario you
[00:20:11] so what do you think about this particular scenario okay is it better to work in a mindless job
[00:20:17] and make money or is it better to follow your passion and possibly make less money I definitely think
[00:20:25] the best thing to do is work it a job that you're passionate about and make a lot of money that's
[00:20:31] that's the best thing to do I do know that one that's not always possible and here's something
[00:20:38] you got to be careful of if you ever heard people talk about making your hobby your job right and
[00:20:45] generally that's like oh if I make my hobby my job then I'll enjoy my job right there's another
[00:20:52] way of looking at it if you make your hobby your job you won't like your hobby anymore yeah that's
[00:20:59] another way of looking at that so it depends on what kind of like a GG2 instructor right hey I'll
[00:21:04] just open my own school then I'll just get to do what I love all day long you talk to a lot of
[00:21:09] GG2 instructors after six years they don't even like go into the academy they don't want to go
[00:21:14] to the academy anymore because it's all is oh yeah I don't want to teach it one other white belt
[00:21:20] how to do it on our mocker over it so it's not necessarily the best thing to make what you're
[00:21:27] passionate about and there's some people that teach you to do every single day and they love it
[00:21:31] and that's awesome and so they've they've won right because they're making money they're doing
[00:21:37] they're having a good livelihood and they enjoy doing it so yeah but my goal would be to do something
[00:21:44] that I'm passionate about at the same time you got to set yourself up so that you're not stuck
[00:21:50] without any money right because passion doesn't pay the rent I'll tell you an example of this
[00:21:55] Greg Train sure years ago Greg Train said to me hey here's my options I can like kind of
[00:22:03] scrape by teach wrestling teach some GG2 and train to fight or I can guy got accepted into this program
[00:22:12] to be an x-ray technician and he asked me he's like what do you what do you think I should do this
[00:22:18] is a long time ago it's probably like 10 or 12 years ago maybe even longer anyway so he asked me
[00:22:24] and I said listen how many hours a day do you want to train and I said how many hours they can you train
[00:22:33] and he's like I don't know maybe three or four hours a day okay so if you want to do this three or
[00:22:38] four hours a day and you're not going to make any money what you're going to do with the other
[00:22:42] whatever 20 hours a day you could actually build a career and make real money doing the x-ray thing
[00:22:51] and then you could still easily because you work eight hours a day I was like I was like Greg
[00:22:59] I work 12 hours a day I work 14 hours they I'm still here training you can work in eight
[00:23:04] hour a day and still train and you can train four hours a day and you can be fine and you'll have money
[00:23:10] you don't have to worry about paying the rent you don't have to deal with the buy you know nice things
[00:23:13] you'll have medical insurance all those things and he made the decision to go to x-ray school and he ended
[00:23:20] up doing great in GG2 and doing great in fighting and he ended up getting some injuries that were
[00:23:25] like if he would have just been a fighter they would have been really problematic because you know he
[00:23:30] couldn't fight for a long time he so that's the kind of that's the kind of judgment call right you can make
[00:23:40] now what what this question is saying though is can you do something when you make a little bit
[00:23:45] last put your passion about that's that's pretty easy call as far as I would start if you just
[00:23:50] make a little bit last put you love doing it well that's kind of a no-brainer right isn't it
[00:23:55] now you gotta ask yourself where does that put you in the future and then you gotta ask yourself
[00:24:02] on the other side is could you do this job that you don't really like for long enough that you could
[00:24:07] make a difference like you could do this job that you don't like and you all said you got a down payment
[00:24:12] for a house and then you go by a house you see what I'm saying yeah so that's that's not a bad movie
[00:24:18] a bad move either but you could also this is where people trap themselves they have the job that
[00:24:25] didn't like they're making a little bit more money and instead of investing towards getting out of that
[00:24:31] job and setting themselves up so where they can do something that they are passionate what they do is they
[00:24:36] expand their lifestyle yeah that's the big mistake they expand their lifestyle and all of a sudden
[00:24:43] you know they're making a hundred thousand dollars a year at this job that they don't really like
[00:24:49] the other job they were gonna get seventy five thousand dollars a year and that that's not bad right
[00:24:55] I would probably go for the thing that I really like doing if it's a difference of twenty five thousand
[00:24:58] dollars that's kind of a no-brainer to me what does the person do they say okay well I'll just stay in
[00:25:04] this job so I can make enough money to get a down payment on a house and then what do they do they buy a
[00:25:08] new car they go out to dinner every night they spend that extra twenty five thousand that they could
[00:25:13] be putting into saving up for down payment they spend it on stuff that they don't need to end up with
[00:25:16] a hundred and ten thousand dollar lifestyle while they're making a hundred thousand dollars a year
[00:25:21] and they actually go into debt and now they're further away from the job that they wanted yeah
[00:25:27] so I guess the answer here is and I've said this before come up with an exit strategy
[00:25:33] with contingencies if things go wrong and then plan save prepare and then execute
[00:25:41] you you meet somes like a good plan good take on it what's something they I found that when you
[00:25:49] make your hobby your career there a lot of times like when you have fantasies about doing your
[00:25:54] hobby as a crit let's say I'm a photographer right that's a big one that's a common one that's heard
[00:26:00] there'll be like okay because I like taking pictures I like you know I don't know maybe traveling
[00:26:04] or I don't know whatever whatever I like taking pictures of I like that kind of subject to uh but
[00:26:09] so a lot of things when you're you know a creative person or you're into let's say you make baskets
[00:26:17] you make the awesome baskets but to make it your career a lot of the times it comes with like
[00:26:22] 50% if that a hundred percent additional chores and tasks but running that business yeah I was
[00:26:30] going to say yeah you like making baskets oh yeah cool and what you end up doing is making
[00:26:35] thousands of the same baskets that you put their green with the Easter Bunny in it and that's
[00:26:40] what your job is to weave that basket over and over again everything that you're doing it for is
[00:26:44] now gone yeah and and guess what you have to do it and you have to do you have to like it as a hobby
[00:26:49] that's kind of in my opinion pretty much the one of the two things that make a hobby so great is because
[00:26:56] it's fun to do and you don't want everyone as long as you have the time as long as you do whenever you
[00:27:01] want if you don't feel like that if you don't do it like if you don't feel like golfing tomorrow you
[00:27:05] yeah or you don't feel like golfing or are you gonna go no no no you know of course not you don't
[00:27:10] have to but if you love making baskets and you don't feel like it and you're like I guess what you
[00:27:15] gotta make a thousand of those I know you don't feel like you've been making one you gotta make a
[00:27:18] thousand or make sure they're done or something like man I used to love this thing now I don't
[00:27:23] really like it because all this pressure which had nothing to do with my hobby by the way nothing
[00:27:26] now it has everything to do with my hobby now you got I had not have people calling me saying hey
[00:27:31] where is my basket hey I'm the basket maker I say when the basket gets made kind of thing
[00:27:35] that's gone so yeah so you don't really like it and so yeah you got the repetitiveness the
[00:27:42] like we call lack of control lack of control the pressure the pressure and then that's not
[00:27:48] mentioned like the day to day chores that allow your hobby activity to be a business or or
[00:27:56] career whatever man it's a lot like freaking taxes and taxes doing all the yeah man you know
[00:28:04] how like when you're you work at like a job and the taxes are just taking out the taxes
[00:28:09] taking out and all this stuff but man you're weaving baskets you know in your in your new garage or
[00:28:14] whatever man you gotta do taxes all this I don't know man this is just a lot more to it
[00:28:19] we'll see a child from hobby to career yeah that's true so that's my my shout out to my tax guy
[00:28:26] man he rocks so hard is the best guy ever yeah I can dig it but yeah so there's that and then
[00:28:34] but yeah if you're prepared for that though if you're totally prepared for that or if you kind of
[00:28:38] like business you know that part of it because there's a lot of chores in business yeah and if you
[00:28:42] like that stuff oh man that can be good but yeah and oh and here's the thing too about when you
[00:28:47] get a good job I'm not a good job but a high paying job but you don't like it this is why this is
[00:28:52] what I think anyway I don't think I've ever had a junk job that paid a lot you just had junk
[00:28:59] low paying jobs yes yes yes so I had a few of those yes for sure so okay I go I wake up I go to
[00:29:05] my job drag myself to my job right drag myself and then I can't wait to get home and get home and
[00:29:11] get that paycheck after a week two weeks or whatever get that huge paycheck then I got to drag myself
[00:29:16] to my job again and I go home and I can let me read so basically your day to day for that junk job
[00:29:23] is so junk I need something I need pleasure I need some pleasure in my life by that cool new car so
[00:29:28] now oh sure I'll drag myself to my job but at least I'm rolling in that new nice new car
[00:29:33] or but eventually you trap yourself with that car that car is right trap because that becomes
[00:29:37] the focus a lot of times yeah you know like to make up and I believe so this is an interesting
[00:29:41] thing I've thought about people like to make things people like to make things like it's it's
[00:29:46] it's a good feeling to make something to create something and I think a lot of the consumer
[00:29:53] attitude comes from the fact that look I don't have time to go and build the desk and I wish I
[00:29:59] did have time to go build a desk but I'll just go click on this button and the desk will show up
[00:30:03] my house and it's kind of like I create it something yeah well there it is and that gives you that
[00:30:11] but the thing is it's a short term gratification yeah that's why it keeps going because you go okay
[00:30:17] I really like to make a desk but I'm just gonna buy this one or I'd really like to you know what I love
[00:30:20] to do is just is just completely refurbish an old car oh I can't do that but guess what I can
[00:30:26] I can just buy a new car and then I'm rolling it feels good for a minute but you don't get the
[00:30:31] pure you don't get the deep satisfaction that you would have gotten had you refurbished the car
[00:30:37] so you get you drop yourself so keep your spending and check this is another part of this whole deal
[00:30:41] yeah spending and check but that's spending feels so good and then you know how like
[00:30:46] it depends because there's sometimes when you don't have a lot of money spending hurts
[00:30:52] you know it hurts when you're like I can't separate myself from this money yeah and you have
[00:30:56] you have a different mindset I think but I think like a your average person me included
[00:31:01] is like the the spending hurts when you spend spend on stuff you need rather than what you
[00:31:06] like want you know that's so backwards that's so bad but it's a short term thing for sure it's
[00:31:13] like the immediate like satisfaction is like when you got to pay let's say you you don't really have
[00:31:19] dentoin shirts right or let's say you do but you still got to pay out of all whatever you have to
[00:31:23] spend your money on that it's a $1,000 and you have $1,500 in your bank account what's it so it doesn't
[00:31:29] feel good to spend on dental but it would have felt good to buy a new plasma screen TV that you
[00:31:34] can watch the UFC and think about it when that plasma TV comes in you're like oh my gosh you
[00:31:39] can't wait to hook this up this thing is awesome I'll even put it on my credit card and pay for that
[00:31:43] thing over the next 12 months 50% interest on this thing I'll do that no problem because of that
[00:31:49] pleasure of getting it but oh dental you mean this toothache will go away this toothache that's
[00:31:55] causing me a migraine will go away and then I got you know then when it's time to pay that bill
[00:32:02] it's hard man you don't really want it it's weird Chad is backwards so
[00:32:07] all right well like I said come up with a plan come up with an extra out of G with contingencies and then
[00:32:13] save you money and execute get some check next question how do you suggest setting SOPs
[00:32:20] standard operating procedures we're none currently exist yeah good question and this is uh
[00:32:28] not gonna spend a ton of time on this well the best way to to develop SOPs is to let them be
[00:32:32] developed organically sort of from the people that are actually doing that task whatever it is
[00:32:39] and you kind of you you just turn what's actually happening into an SOP and then if there's
[00:32:45] multiple methods happening for something you kind of consolidate the methods into the best way
[00:32:52] and then test them and then you'll have your SOP there one thing that you shouldn't do with an SOP
[00:32:57] is come up with an a standard operating procedure inside of a vacuum and then push it down on the
[00:33:01] folks below you in the chain of command because they're gonna be they're gonna reject it um they are going to
[00:33:07] to they are going to know a better way of doing it because you made it up in a vacuum so so don't
[00:33:14] do that now there are sometimes where let's say you're gonna do something brand new that's never been
[00:33:20] done before and you have to kind of create an SOP then if you have to do that you you need to kind of
[00:33:29] explain to the team hey listen guys we've never done this type of mission before we've never done
[00:33:33] this type of project before here's my best guess at what a standard operating procedure is going to look like
[00:33:39] we're gonna try and execute this but believe me it's not perfect I'm open to feedback and I
[00:33:44] realize that it's gonna change but I want at least have a line for us to deviate from and actually
[00:33:49] this is an extreme ownership I talked about how we started organizing the SSE the sensitive
[00:33:57] slight sensitive site exploitation it's how we searched buildings and it's in the book but when
[00:34:02] first started searching buildings we'd ever just go in and ransack everything and just throw everything
[00:34:05] around and it was totally ridiculous and ineffective and eventually you know I said okay we need
[00:34:10] to standard operating procedure in my system. Two commander said hey come up with a standard operating
[00:34:14] procedure of how we're gonna do this he did that and when he did of course and it's in the book
[00:34:19] people like oh this is gonna take forever and I was like okay listen we're gonna try it if there's
[00:34:23] some adjustments we got to make will make them but let's at least give it a try it and that's what we did
[00:34:27] and one of the best things you can do if you have to come up with an SOP is not only let it come
[00:34:34] organically from the task itself but let the people that are actually doing the task come up with
[00:34:40] the standard operating procedure so if you had if you had some project that you did over and over again
[00:34:45] I wouldn't come and say hey here's how I want you to do this project from now on Echo I'd say hey Echo
[00:34:50] since you're doing this all the time can you capture what it is you do and and we can take those
[00:34:54] best practices turn them into a standard operating procedure and get them through the whole
[00:34:58] organization and you'd say oh that's cool you would kind of feel some ownership of that and then you would
[00:35:04] put together a good plan so that's pretty straightforward with standard operating procedures the the
[00:35:10] main thing is let them develop let the team develop them keep an open mind don't force them
[00:35:15] down people's throat next question I'm a 17 year old I'm a blue belt in Giu Jitsu which I received a few
[00:35:28] days after my 16th birthday and I have ambitions of pursuing Giu Jitsu professionally and competing
[00:35:34] to the highest level possible of course this requires discipline and commitment so during the school term
[00:35:41] I trained Giu Jitsu Monday through Saturday and I wait train on Friday and Sunday and when I have
[00:35:47] time off school I trained Giu Jitsu three times a day however due to my commitment to this and my
[00:35:52] refusal to prioritize the other things over this I feel I'm missing out on the social opportunities of
[00:35:59] this part of my life I miss parties and social events in order to train Giu Jitsu and wait train
[00:36:05] because I know that I should have the discipline to do so however I feel lonely and isolated because of it
[00:36:12] is this just weakness or should I make the occasional exception for a social event once again love
[00:36:19] the work you do you and I go do it's an how it's helped me immensely thanks from you okay all right
[00:36:23] that you okay first of all it's just okay the hardcore here's the couple hardcore answers
[00:36:29] hardcore and it's no what's your schedule like right are you wasting any time have you have you
[00:36:36] maxed and maximize the hours you can get out of a day or are you spending time doing other things
[00:36:43] that you shouldn't be doing that being said it sounds like you're getting after it pretty hard
[00:36:47] which means you're probably pretty efficient and if you're if you're not wasting a bunch of time
[00:36:54] and you're not doing a bunch of things that are non productive and you're feeling lonely and
[00:37:02] isolated then guess what you're going to for you don't you should not be feeling lonely and isolated
[00:37:07] that's not good you need to relax especially because if you're training that much you're likely
[00:37:13] over training so broadly speaking now broadly speaking training should be enjoyable okay this is
[00:37:21] me that you're going to love it every day and I talk about that all the time this means every
[00:37:24] day you wake up and you're all you know smile from one ear to the other you're so happy you got to
[00:37:28] go do you know squats and deadlifts like no that doesn't happen but broadly the way it
[00:37:34] makes you feel the way you get you makes you feel should make you yeah other times when you go on
[00:37:39] the just too mad and you get spanked and you get ground out and you get tapped out and you feel like
[00:37:47] junk yes that's going to happen but again broadly how does Jesus who make you feel makes you feel good
[00:37:52] you should enjoy it to some extent right and you should not be getting burnt out and I think that's
[00:37:58] the most important thing is that you shouldn't be getting burnt out on jiu-jitsu on working out
[00:38:06] and this is this is important especially for your 17 years old there is more to life than
[00:38:15] jiu-jitsu in physical fitness right there's more to there's more to there's more to doing well
[00:38:24] in life than just jiu-jitsu in physical fitness so a couple things if you can't if you can't
[00:38:34] like communicate with people effectively that's a real problem in any environment right and if you're
[00:38:40] isolating yourself from other people and you're not you're not learning how to interact with other
[00:38:47] human beings in a social environment that's not good and it's not only it's not only that it's
[00:38:52] it's not only that it's just not good for you because yes you as a person you need to be well
[00:38:57] rounded you need to yes you need to be strong you need to be capable from a fighting perspective
[00:39:01] but you also need to be smart you need to be articulate you need to be quick with it
[00:39:05] and those things are mandatory skills in life I mean if you're a black belt in jiu-jitsu
[00:39:13] and you're a white belt in communicating with other human beings that's not going to be a good
[00:39:16] situation for you and the other thing is the better you are the more well rounded you are in all these
[00:39:24] other aspects of life those things will actually make you better at jiu-jitsu because you'll be
[00:39:27] able to read people you'll be able to deal with confrontation you'll be able to understand other
[00:39:31] people's motivations and all those things come from interacting with other human beings so I get it
[00:39:40] I get the massive commitment and that is what it takes like if you want to compete at the highest level
[00:39:46] I'm telling you yes you have to live breathe and eat jiu-jitsu you have to live breathe and eat conditioning
[00:39:53] and that being said if that's all you live breathe and eat that's going to make you less
[00:40:03] apt to be a champion then if you make yourself a little bit more well rounded in some of these other
[00:40:10] aspects so do keep training hard 17 year old blue belt from UK keep training hard
[00:40:19] go out occasionally hang out with some people have a good time and that by no means means get hammered
[00:40:30] every time you do it all not at all yeah yeah yeah that's social aspect man that's like
[00:40:35] that's it seems like a lot of times especially when you're training or you're doing something that's
[00:40:40] kind of directly or can be viewed as like directly opposite of a social thing because you don't
[00:40:44] when you think socially you're thinking all you guys are just slack and hanging out going to the bar cruising at the beach
[00:40:50] whatever well while we're over here training kind of thing right just like just like people say oh you're
[00:40:56] sleeping on the couch you know what are you lazy sleeping on the couch well I don't know maybe they need rest you know
[00:41:01] or make there's there's there's use in sleep seems like that was a that was a little
[00:41:07] maybe kind of a glimpse into the echo Charles world right there maybe maybe not
[00:41:11] not live sleep on the couch maybe I need rest maybe I'm recovering from the work I just did
[00:41:16] you seem saying I'm saying there's two parts of it you know there's that and so
[00:41:22] and people give it a bad rap I think especially like you know how like you know you hear these
[00:41:27] motivational gurus grind all sleep when I'm dead you know that kind of thing right yeah I say that
[00:41:33] so yeah I you said it not me but hey all right so and I'm not saying that you know that's
[00:41:40] dumb or nothing like that I'm saying that I'm saying that it produces a certain message that
[00:41:46] can be interpreted in a way that might not be the most beneficial well I'm sure I think this
[00:41:52] just I'm glad that he asked this question because he's taking the attitude of like okay
[00:41:57] I'm gonna sleep on that and I'm gonna hang out with other human beings after my world champion
[00:42:02] and again do you need to be possessed to be a world champion yes you do but all I'm saying is
[00:42:10] part of the things that will make you be a better well-rounded person the more well-rounded you are
[00:42:16] the better you're gonna perform you know you're gonna learn how to deal with anxiety you're gonna learn how to
[00:42:20] deal with people you're gonna learn how to look at someone else's situate looking their eyes and be like
[00:42:24] okay this guy's stressed out or this guy's panicking or this guy you know you learn those things
[00:42:28] from interacting with the people that's gonna make you a better competitor you're gonna learn
[00:42:31] more about yourself that's gonna make you a better competitor and you're gonna be if you if you
[00:42:35] relax now what you don't want to do is go so far in the other direction where you when you show up
[00:42:40] to a competition you don't feel like you've prepared as much as you could but
[00:42:45] that what does that do you go to far in the other direction now you over-trained
[00:42:49] so you gotta find a little bit of but sounds like you're a little bit off balance especially
[00:42:53] because you're feeling like the words that kind of keyed me off the most in this was what was
[00:42:57] it lonely and isolated that that's what kind of if you said everything else here and then you
[00:43:03] are like um am I over-training? I would have said no man you're getting after a good job but then
[00:43:10] when you say look I feel lonely and isolated you don't want to feel lonely and isolated like
[00:43:15] and that's another thing when I change jitsu that's kind of where I hang out like I don't
[00:43:18] interact with the normal it's a social thing we might not even talk we might not even say one word
[00:43:24] other than do you want to roll and then we train that's sort of my social activity of
[00:43:30] hanging around with other people and I don't feel I leave the gym and I feel like I hung around
[00:43:33] with a lot of people I didn't say anything to them but if you feel lonely and isolated that's not
[00:43:40] good that's getting to you that means your mind is starting to be worn down from this don't let it
[00:43:45] get worn down it's gonna refuel you to go out it's gonna I watch this watch this if you're feeling
[00:43:52] only isolated you're workout that day is like a nine if you feel like like hey I'm having a good
[00:43:59] life I'm I'm filled with energy I like hanging out I just you know how to good time with this girl
[00:44:04] last night and now I'm going to train it's like oh okay guess what that's workouts 9.7 you get a
[00:44:09] better training because you had a good time yeah so yeah I don't like the fact that he says he's
[00:44:16] lonely and isolated that's not good and again this is just a dichotomy because then you get someone
[00:44:24] that says okay well jocals are go out and you don't have party you know party party party with the ladies
[00:44:29] and then and then help my workout yeah I'll help my workout and then well you know
[00:44:34] maybe if I only workout three times a week and I spend most of my time partying I'll be just
[00:44:40] I'll get workouts level 11 no you won't so yeah man make some exceptions to your discipline
[00:44:48] and go enjoy the company of some other people grow a little bit as a person become a better human
[00:44:53] compete better train harder that's it agree so the man this is a concept that I think is if you
[00:45:01] can kind of incorporate or understand this concept in you know when you're working hard at something
[00:45:06] so when I was young when I first started lifting weights first started I don't know 15 or whatever
[00:45:12] well done so you know you know how when you live weights and you get that little pump right
[00:45:18] to me to me I thought that that's literally my muscles growing you know like I didn't know how
[00:45:24] it all worked I was like dang my muscles I can see the growth already so all I got to do is
[00:45:29] lift every single day watch out quick you know because most people they won't work as hard as me
[00:45:34] because all just because I like doing it I like to pump whatever so I would do we remember
[00:45:41] the guy my friend I mentioned Eric Masters pilot in the air force yes so he he at the one
[00:45:48] he always said the soda above my boy anyway so I'd lift with him and his dad would invite me
[00:45:54] my brother over we'll we'll lift we'll any start off with Bench and you know this stuff so
[00:45:58] we go lift and I'm like dang I feel like pump so now when I when we trend kind of went into
[00:46:06] I want to say like far city football I don't know anyway we started lifting in the weight room at
[00:46:10] the high school so I would do the same thing every single day every single day every single day
[00:46:14] and my friend was like this other guy you know he goes hey you are you Bench in every single day
[00:46:20] you know it was like yeah and he was like bro your muscles aren't going to grow that's like what
[00:46:24] are you talking about of course they do they grow every single day like I feel it even he's like bro you
[00:46:28] don't know how it works he's like you don't when you lift they don't grow they actually get torn
[00:46:33] they get like almost like a little micro injury that's how it works and then when you rest and when
[00:46:39] you sleep and when you eat and they grow and it did it still didn't make sense well it's like okay I
[00:46:45] guess you know he's like you ever you know when the the sorness you know when you get the sorness or
[00:46:49] whatever it was like yeah he's like that's like it like hurt like kind of injured whatever and then
[00:46:53] it has to heal up and when it heals up it heals up bigger and I'm like okay so you can't ban
[00:46:58] to every day otherwise it'll just like it'll just won't grow it always be damaged I was like
[00:47:02] all makes sense so that rest in between workouts it's kind of important given my goal
[00:47:09] grow so muscles you see I'm saying where this kind of thing works like all go all go no rest
[00:47:15] but you need that rest to grow literally and that goes for anything truth and this is kind of
[00:47:21] the next question is very closely related to this that's why I put it kind of like right next to it
[00:47:28] yeah and that is jockel I should have asked it muster 0's or 6 is there a dichotomy
[00:47:34] dichotomy in the unmitigated, unmitigated daily discipline in all things yeah and like I said this is
[00:47:41] why I put this question here because it's related to the question the answer that I just gave
[00:47:45] which is yes you can you can overdo it and there is a dichotomy you can put so much focus on working
[00:47:56] you can put so much working so much focus on working that you lose track of your family
[00:48:01] and everything goes down tell with your family or you can do the opposite put so much focus on your
[00:48:04] family that you lose track of that you don't do what you're supposed to do at work so you need to
[00:48:11] back off a little and you get people that waste time on things that don't matter this goes back
[00:48:18] remember the podcast we did where I was talking about how like a black belt when a white belt
[00:48:24] is grabbing a black belt sleeve and it just doesn't matter there's people that think that
[00:48:29] it's important that I do this thing this certain way and the reality is it's useless it doesn't
[00:48:35] matter you're being OCD right you're being OCD so or you maybe not being full OCD but you're being
[00:48:41] borderline you got to think about what's important and what's not important and if you're
[00:48:45] discipline if you generally or oftentimes people that are hyper disciplined about little things
[00:48:55] a lot of times they're missing their discipline and other areas of their life and one of them
[00:49:00] and and you we've talked about this before too which is somebody that just because someone is
[00:49:04] hyper disciplined in their physical fitness doesn't mean that they're disciplined in their
[00:49:08] rest of their life in many other ways whether it's financial whether it's their relationships
[00:49:13] whatever like everything they can be screwing every they're super disciplined in weighing their food
[00:49:20] and doing macro calorie counting and all that stuff right and yet they haven't paid their phone bill
[00:49:27] or whatever and they've got financial issues or they've got health like other health issues
[00:49:32] and so you need that you need to back off enough on the little things that don't matter
[00:49:40] that so that the things that matter you can actually take care of now the weird dichotomy in this
[00:49:45] is again it always comes up the Russian soldiers in the Cheshiren war not shaving
[00:49:51] is it really important that they shave not really but what's really important is that they
[00:49:58] have discipline overall and when they stop shaving they let go of their discipline and that was the
[00:50:04] problem now so there's about that's what I'm saying there's a balance and I guess let me let me
[00:50:11] make that a little more clearly if we were in a war and what I was focused on was echo you better
[00:50:18] shave tomorrow that was my big focus echo your uniform better be squared away tomorrow like that
[00:50:24] that is not what the most important the most important thing is like echo do you understand
[00:50:29] where the fallback positions are echo do you understand what your field of fire is echo do you
[00:50:33] know what you're supposed to do when we start getting over run those are what's important
[00:50:36] and but if I focus on this little thing that doesn't really matter that can that can be a problem
[00:50:44] so I need to make sure that I'm focused on the correct things and in life yes you can unmitigate a
[00:50:49] daily discipline if you try to apply it to absolutely everything in your life just like prioritize next
[00:50:54] year if you try to solve all your problems at the same time you won't be able to solve any
[00:50:57] if you try to implement perfect discipline in every single thing that you do you won't be able to
[00:51:04] apply discipline to the things that are most important my garage gym floor is dirty
[00:51:14] okay I sweep it I sweep it every third day I just sweep it out but I don't get in there with a bucket
[00:51:23] and a mop and trying clean the chalk off so it's perfect black why because it doesn't matter
[00:51:31] so some things in life are like your gym floor it just it doesn't matter if there's chalk on it
[00:51:37] I'm gonna put more chalk on it later the chalk doesn't make me slip it doesn't make me sick
[00:51:41] it doesn't it doesn't I don't care how it looks so don't worry about the chalk on the gym floor
[00:51:46] in fact there's gyms in the world where you're not allowed to have chalk because they don't want
[00:51:50] chalk on the gym floor those places shouldn't exist in the world they should be they should be
[00:51:57] illegal yes there should be chalk everywhere yeah gym available yeah you're right so don't
[00:52:03] focus on things that don't matter there you go you know it seems like the whole discipline
[00:52:07] equals freedom thing and whether you agree with it or not actually you know I think you will agree with this
[00:52:11] it's a dance you know it's a dance with discipline and freedom you mean about about about
[00:52:17] the economy yes it's in fact a lot of book about it yeah thank you so it's gonna be
[00:52:23] to take ownership it's just it just depends on who you are like you the discipline is going to
[00:52:29] be taking the lead big time you know and when you exercise your freedom with I don't know I don't
[00:52:35] know I mean chalk ice cream or something like this when you exercise that freedom it's not
[00:52:40] gonna be very often but when you do boom yeah it's gonna have benefit yeah and that's when you
[00:52:44] see somebody that's let's just talk about this well when you see somebody that's out of shape
[00:52:49] you could say you could say one or two things you could say not enough discipline or you could say
[00:52:54] too much freedom we know it's one of those two things yes have you see someone that's
[00:52:58] having financial issues yeah it's one or two things not enough discipline or too much freedom they're
[00:53:03] getting out that credit card when they're doing right yeah so yeah they goes without saying
[00:53:07] that it's a balance it's the economy that's correct yeah so even and also on top of that the
[00:53:14] discipline and all things because that's a question right in all maybe you could
[00:53:18] maybe you could write a book called the dance of leadership
[00:53:24] it's a copy that I got me but the in all things like discipline in diet discipline in
[00:53:31] um you know workouts and not slack in and whatever and that looks way different than discipline
[00:53:37] in like relationships for example like if you're like a different like to you know the discipline
[00:53:42] not to lose your temper or they're just a plan to to respond to a maybe not discipline person
[00:53:48] or something let's say someone you love who's who's maybe emotionally different than you
[00:53:52] or whatever that looks and feels way different you know if you if you really think about it so
[00:53:57] if you're like hey I'm not gonna I don't know I'm not gonna go to the park with my wife because I'm
[00:54:06] working now that's my discipline yeah so you're lacking the discipline to
[00:54:11] organize around your relationship with your relationship or you're lacking the discipline to
[00:54:17] make sure that your wife understands that you're going to train yeah because I'm going to train
[00:54:21] but as far as we're like and now that's back on the training and but like with like your relationships
[00:54:27] unless your relationships aren't important to you which is I mean I would argue most times
[00:54:32] there's some relationships in your life that that are gonna be important I would argue that
[00:54:38] well yeah there should be I think so too yes so that's where you're up to before
[00:54:43] maintaining discipline in those relationships looks different so it might not be as obvious
[00:54:48] someone someone says me unmit it when you say unmit it get a discipline and all things I don't
[00:54:53] think automatically right off the top of my head like oh you know my relationship with my wife
[00:54:58] you know or even the relationship with your kids like when I think unmit it get a daily discipline
[00:55:02] in all things including my kids so I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure they're discipline all but
[00:55:07] the discipline of your of yourself dealing with the kids that's a whole different thing
[00:55:12] soon saying true so you gotta get a keep those in mind oh I found myself yeah I find when I
[00:55:17] I keep that in mind it it'll help and then yeah and do the dance with freedom you
[00:55:22] designate how much freedom you are gonna exercise and then you do the dance
[00:55:27] soon saying you balance the dichotomy is what you do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:55:31] bro right you dance right it's a it and he's gone man here's the wrong thing what I made
[00:55:39] a mistake of at one point long time ago I looked at you and I was like should I need to do that
[00:55:45] I need to wake up I need to like do all this stuff water but if I were to do that I'd jump myself up
[00:55:53] so I can't like you can't use like the next person as the standard as far as the balance goes
[00:55:58] like you have to designate your own balance yeah because you have to modulate for your life
[00:56:03] yeah whatever bro people don't just automatically know that I know I didn't
[00:56:08] check figure it out and see you get up at 430 at any point though yeah I tried you know that
[00:56:15] check anyway next question is there one form or type of jiu jitsu that is better
[00:56:23] than other forms not Japanese versus small circle jiu jitsu but pressure versus movement
[00:56:31] bottom versus top different types of quote unquote games got it yeah so if you don't know
[00:56:37] there's different types of jiu jitsu in the world there's things like he mentioned here
[00:56:41] there's Japanese jiu jitsu and there's something called small circle jiu jitsu and then there's
[00:56:45] just a million different kind of random sort of names that people will put on jiu jitsu right
[00:56:53] the one that we do is generally referred to as Brazilian jiu jitsu I just generally referred to
[00:57:01] as jiu jitsu because that's what I'm talking about so there are different types of all the
[00:57:07] different types of jiu jitsu the one that you should be doing is Brazilian jiu jitsu the other types
[00:57:14] are not what you want to be doing yeah generally and yeah so that's just the
[00:57:21] necessary out of it so now but then he's asking a different question which is inside of inside of
[00:57:28] even Brazilian jiu jitsu there's different types of styles that people will have and these are
[00:57:36] people go end up calling them games like what kind of game does this person have what kind of
[00:57:41] game does that person have and different people have different games and it depends on their body
[00:57:47] the different body types have different styles different games different even different like
[00:57:52] cardio levels can have different games different styles different flexibility levels different
[00:57:57] games different styles even different personalities if you have different personalities you'll end up with
[00:58:05] a different style so the question is are there some games or some styles that are better than
[00:58:14] other games or other styles inside of jiu jitsu and my answer to that I think is no there's not
[00:58:22] games that are better than other games not styles of jiu jitsu that are better than other styles
[00:58:28] of jiu jitsu it's just different people gravitate towards different ones and they use them successfully
[00:58:36] and that's why they continue to use them I would say this though if you can then develop
[00:58:44] more than one game right more than one game like if all you know how to do is pressure pass
[00:58:52] that's the only kind of pass you know and you come up against someone that's really good
[00:58:55] of getting a defending the pressure pass you won't be able to pass the guard if you're if you
[00:59:01] have a really good top game but you go against the wrestler that's a better wrestler than you
[00:59:05] put you on your back then that's going to be a problem so you're going to have to think people
[00:59:12] ask is how do I develop my style the answer is you just train and your style is going to come
[00:59:16] you you don't know that case is someone might tell you like hey you're long and lanky you should
[00:59:19] use triangle you should set up good triangle games or good darshtokes or someone says hey you're
[00:59:24] you got good base you should you know use a lot of pressure so there can be someone giving you some
[00:59:28] indication but you're going to self select as you train what works and as you continue to do
[00:59:34] what works for you you'll get better and better at it yeah that's funny you think it makes
[00:59:39] sense like just train and it'll sort of sort itself you know your game your style like and
[00:59:45] there the reason um it might seem kind of but the reason why I like these tall lanky guys
[00:59:50] they'll do like triangles and stuff because when they first start training though the triangle
[00:59:55] is going to come way easier than a guy who's not as lanky you know early on so they're
[00:59:59] like oh shoot that's successful so it's kind of like check that that's good so they're again
[01:00:03] boom that becomes part of their game super early so that kind of is a dominant part of their whole
[01:00:10] game and then you know the more the more they train the more things are going to start falling into
[01:00:15] place in their game you know and so if you have a lanky all those lanky moves are going to register
[01:00:19] way quicker than you know a shorter guy or stock your guy that's yeah it's funny how you put
[01:00:24] that just train it'll sort of just they reveal themselves they reveal that's all yeah they totally do
[01:00:30] check yeah this this question also ties into the next question so I kind of coupled it up with
[01:00:35] the next question as well did you do you feel well you know your answer to the is there a better
[01:00:41] game or whatever I feel like you know like when you watch ADCC or something like this and then you
[01:00:46] just have a guy like Hodger who's six four you know and then you have Marcelo Garcia you guys
[01:00:51] who are arguably like just is good the best guy is ever to do it and they're just completely
[01:00:57] out of your body body so yeah body types man it's kind of like when I watch those kind of like
[01:01:01] um like you ever heard of the game mortal combat I have heard of it yeah so it's like this it's
[01:01:06] this real violent game I was too dumb because it's like they have weapons and stuff that they
[01:01:09] can sort of bust out random like this guy named Scorpion his weapon it's a spear with a rope
[01:01:14] or chain or whatever and he pulls you and he does this thing and the guy who can freeze people you know
[01:01:19] and the guy who can uh I don't know throw his hat and just cut people I don't know you know so
[01:01:23] people have all these different weapons but then you would think hey if a guy can freeze a person
[01:01:28] wouldn't he be the best guy you just freeze people it's all you gotta do you know but doesn't
[01:01:33] work itself out it's whoever's good at using the little ice ray or whatever it's called
[01:01:37] it's interesting who's better at using that spear with the rope okay we'll go with it man
[01:01:43] but that's that's the way it works and you just do two of them just change well anyways that
[01:01:47] question relates to the next question oh okay yes next question sure yes hi jocardo combat
[01:01:53] oh what's the story fighter let us do there street fighter too yes actually there's street fighter
[01:01:59] which really kind of went unnoticed I think by the general public then there's street fighter too
[01:02:04] that's when it sort of became like this big that was like the main combat game I think with
[01:02:10] fighting street fighter too what year was that I don't know I was in high school also I don't
[01:02:14] 90's it was good I was doing jiu jitsu yeah and uh yeah man you missed out a little bit because
[01:02:21] there was a lot of common on anything best street fighter too with there's this guy named
[01:02:25] gile seems gile bro I'm telling you I'm telling you revisit that or in your case visit that
[01:02:32] gile he threw this thing called a sonic it's it's it's just look at it anyway next question jocko
[01:02:38] there's an army cliche that I'm sure you've heard of or you've heard that goes everyone's
[01:02:44] leadership style is different I've heard it used many times as a cover up for failed mission or
[01:02:50] with someone who just isn't getting it done what's your opinion on this for all the advice that
[01:02:54] you give there seems to be a continuous method to your madness and some basic principles for being a good
[01:02:59] leader does everyone have a different leadership style or is there an optimal optimal method
[01:03:06] with personality tweaks that's just amazing how well this jiu jitsu comparison to this is this is
[01:03:13] this is just an incredible translation and if you know the way bro bro you see them all things
[01:03:19] because what this question is is exactly the same as the question above and and the fact the matter is
[01:03:26] if you know jiu jitsu Brazilian jiu jitsu you know the fundamental principles of it
[01:03:35] you can do these tweaks if you don't know the fundamental principles of it you're just going to get destroyed
[01:03:39] now okay if you're a catch wrestler that those have the same sort of fundamental things going on
[01:03:47] you know what I mean if you know sombo so if you know jiu jitsu so I'm saying if you understand
[01:03:50] I don't want to call him but if you understand like the fundamental principles of submission
[01:03:54] grappling of any kind if you know what those are then you can make some tweaks to them you can make
[01:04:01] some some adjustments to them to bait based on your style and your body type and your personality
[01:04:07] and your strengths and weaknesses yes it is the same thing with leadership so people are going to have
[01:04:16] different styles they're going to have different styles of leadership some people are super
[01:04:21] care charismatic right and that person could take advantage of their their charisma some people
[01:04:26] like connect with other people really easily some people don't you're going to have just different
[01:04:32] little nuances to your personality and your brain that are going to
[01:04:38] you that you're going to make little adaptations in your leadership style that's okay where it gets
[01:04:44] not okay is if you leave the fundamental principles that's where you have a problem there's
[01:04:52] an example that I thought of when I read this question there was a guy that was coming through
[01:04:57] my training when I was running the the advanced training for the seals and he was making and
[01:05:03] actually Lafes told story you remember Lafes told the story I think it's in the book too I don't
[01:05:08] remember but it's it's podcast book we've talked about it in a bunch we talk about it when we
[01:05:12] to go talk to clients Lafes tells the story about how he was trying to give commands over the
[01:05:18] radio and no one's doing anything because it's ineffective to give commands in the radio
[01:05:24] in a when there's a lot of machine gun firing all the stuff going on so I said Lafes
[01:05:28] used verbal commands and he kind of like looked at me like I was crazy and I said him and just
[01:05:31] give it a try he did it it worked a couple years later I'm running training and there's a guy
[01:05:37] that's given a bunch of commands on the radio and I go to a my go hey man use verbal commands
[01:05:43] and he's like what do you mean and I'm like yell at everyone so they know what it is you
[01:05:48] want them to do they can't hear you on the radio there's a lot of stuff going on and he goes
[01:05:54] I don't lead that way that's what he said to me I don't lead that way and you know they just
[01:06:03] got destroyed because you know in his I don't know if he thought like hey look I'm not going to
[01:06:08] yeah I wasn't telling them to yell at his people I was telling them like yell the verbal commands
[01:06:14] and he wouldn't do it and they just got annihilated all the time and he ended up not doing well
[01:06:22] as a leader because he was breaking the fundamental principles of combat leadership like simple
[01:06:29] clear concise commands that everyone understands if they don't understand it it was fault the
[01:06:32] does it it's yours and if you're talking on the radio given these complex orders people aren't
[01:06:36] going to understand what to do but if you give them the the the standard operating procedure maneuver
[01:06:40] command peel right that's going to get past everyone's gonna do it so he straight away from
[01:06:48] the fundamental principles it's like it's like saying well you know with me if I give you
[01:06:54] if I use a pressure point on your neck then I'll win it's like no actually that's not going to be
[01:06:59] effective you the pressure point thing is a fantasy oh no it's real okay it is real you know what
[01:07:07] and there's a there's certain parts of your body that hurt a little bit more when you press into
[01:07:11] him I understand that that doesn't change you from getting choked doesn't change you from getting
[01:07:17] double egg takedown you try to hit some of the pressure point while they're doing a double egg
[01:07:20] takedown on you you're not gonna make it no it's not gonna happen so you you you have and I've
[01:07:30] told this story too about the guy that wasn't very loud and I told him like hey you got to
[01:07:35] get louder and eventually he got the guys that were loud in his platoon to start giving the verbal
[01:07:38] commands because he wasn't loud enough to do it and that was an effective way still using the same
[01:07:43] principle just using a little bit of a different technique that's fine so yes different leaders
[01:07:47] are gonna lead differently but the principles are gonna remain the same the the principles of
[01:07:51] ownership cover move simple prioritize next you decentralized command and balancing the dichotomies
[01:07:57] and then there's plenty of them in leadership the good leaders out there they will follow those
[01:08:04] principles and they'll make a little tweaks to them based on their personality and that's fine
[01:08:09] but a tweak doesn't require an excuse and also effective or ineffective like if you make a change
[01:08:17] if you do something a certain way and it's not effective then whatever you change this isn't working
[01:08:21] it's not working so use the fundamental principles make little apt to adaptations it's okay
[01:08:28] but if a leader is ineffective and they're failing guess what they're little adaptations like hey
[01:08:34] I could make up a new move right for jiu jitsu and I and I call it the the whiz bang sure
[01:08:41] and I say hey I made up this cool move it's called the whiz bang and let me show it to you and
[01:08:46] so I show it to you and you're like well I don't know if that'll work or not and I like no it'll
[01:08:49] definitely work the cool thing about jiu jitsu is when I try it we find out if it works
[01:08:53] now something doesn't work immediately right but let's say I keep drilling it on you and drilling it on
[01:08:58] you and I can never get you in the whiz bang and then I go in an internment and I try the whiz
[01:09:05] bang and I get smashed and defeated and then I go through the consolation bracket I try the
[01:09:09] whiz bang and it gets smashed and defeated then I go on the next tournament I try the whiz bang
[01:09:13] and it gets smashed and defeated then again the consolation bracket I try the whiz bang
[01:09:17] I get smashed and defeated and I do this for six months and the whiz bang never works
[01:09:21] never works.
[01:09:23] Effective or ineffective.
[01:09:25] Currently ineffective.
[01:09:26] It's ineffective.
[01:09:28] It's ineffective.
[01:09:29] If you're in a leadership position or someone's in a leadership position and they're failing
[01:09:33] and they're failing to execute the mission over and over and over again, they're a little
[01:09:38] tweak, they're a little leadership thing that they think is good to go.
[01:09:41] It's not good to go.
[01:09:44] And it probably, in fact, I'll tell you, it violates one of the fundamental principles
[01:09:48] of combat leadership.
[01:09:51] Okay, if you can identify which one of those things, it's violating.
[01:09:55] You can get them to clean it up and fix it.
[01:09:59] So there you go, whiz bang, don't try it.
[01:10:02] Don't try the whiz bang.
[01:10:03] I don't know though.
[01:10:04] I mean, these jutsu moves, you know how like guys will like bus some moves.
[01:10:09] Man, I don't know.
[01:10:10] It's this endless thing.
[01:10:11] Yes, jutsu moves.
[01:10:12] No, no moves come out.
[01:10:13] Yeah.
[01:10:14] And you won't hit a move 100% of the time and you definitely won't hit it when you first
[01:10:18] start doing it.
[01:10:19] It's going to be hard.
[01:10:20] Normally, arm locks, you think you put on someone before you made someone tap.
[01:10:25] In the beginning, you probably did 50 arm locks before you got someone to tap.
[01:10:29] Yeah, probably more.
[01:10:30] Yeah, maybe even more.
[01:10:32] So that doesn't mean, after the first 49 odds and effect of a mockery do I do?
[01:10:35] Yeah.
[01:10:36] The big differences, the big differences.
[01:10:39] An arm lock is a proven known entity.
[01:10:42] Covered move is a proven known entity.
[01:10:45] Simple is a proven known entity.
[01:10:48] No advertising execute is a proven known entity.
[01:10:52] Extreme ownership is a proven known and decentralized command is a proven.
[01:10:55] It's like an arm lock.
[01:10:56] It's like a choke.
[01:10:57] That's why when some people say to me, oh well, my boss doesn't like extreme ownership.
[01:11:04] You know, I know what's happening.
[01:11:06] Like it's their the boss's ego is offended because there's some other, somebody telling
[01:11:11] them a different way to lead.
[01:11:12] No, it's like, what do you believe in?
[01:11:14] I don't believe in extreme ownership.
[01:11:15] Oh, I blame and I believe in placing the blame on other people.
[01:11:19] That's how I lead.
[01:11:20] That's completely ridiculous.
[01:11:23] Everybody knows that's ridiculous.
[01:11:24] It's completely ridiculous.
[01:11:26] Covered move.
[01:11:27] I don't believe in cover, move.
[01:11:28] Oh, so you just like your other team members to go and take care of themselves and you
[01:11:32] take care of yourself.
[01:11:33] How does that work?
[01:11:34] Don't work.
[01:11:35] It doesn't work.
[01:11:36] Keep it all.
[01:11:37] I don't like to keep things simple.
[01:11:38] No, I like to make things so complicated that people don't understand what I'm talking
[01:11:41] about.
[01:11:42] Does that make any sense whatsoever?
[01:11:44] No, it doesn't.
[01:11:45] Okay, prioritize next cut.
[01:11:48] No, don't do that.
[01:11:49] What I should what I'm going to do is spread myself so thin that I don't have the
[01:11:52] assets or resources to actually accomplish anything.
[01:11:55] That's what I'm going to do because that makes sense because I don't believe in extreme
[01:11:57] ownership or those fundamental laws of combat leadership.
[01:12:01] That's where you're at decentralized command.
[01:12:03] Oh, I don't believe in that.
[01:12:05] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make every single decision myself from the headquarters
[01:12:09] position.
[01:12:10] When you guys want to make a decision out that on the battlefield or out there on the manufacturing
[01:12:14] floor, I want you to run every single decision up through me because that's going to be
[01:12:18] effective.
[01:12:20] So if you violate one of these principles, you're going to have problems as a leader.
[01:12:25] If you tweak these principles, that's fine.
[01:12:28] If you look at decentralized command and you're like, you know what?
[01:12:31] I know that the normal kind of span of control is five people.
[01:12:36] I can handle more than that.
[01:12:37] I can handle nine and you step it up.
[01:12:40] That's that's tweak.
[01:12:41] That's okay.
[01:12:42] Right?
[01:12:43] That's fine.
[01:12:44] If you when you prioritize next Q, hey, the way I prioritize next Q, and this is the
[01:12:48] truth, the way I prioritize next Q, isn't I look at my number one problem and I only
[01:12:53] folks about one, I assign somebody to my number one problem.
[01:12:58] And I say, hey, Bill, go handle that room over there.
[01:13:01] It's a problem.
[01:13:03] And then I look at Mike and say, hey, Mike, get the rest of this hallway cleared.
[01:13:07] So I'm actually handling two things, but I give Bill the priority.
[01:13:10] Right, Lord.
[01:13:11] So that's a tweak.
[01:13:12] I'm using assets.
[01:13:14] That's fine.
[01:13:16] So sometimes, yes, you've got to make these little adjustments.
[01:13:20] Everyone's got a different leadership style, but you don't violate the principles of
[01:13:25] leadership.
[01:13:27] Just like you don't violate the principles of submission grappling, I'll call it.
[01:13:35] Yeah.
[01:13:36] Dig it.
[01:13:37] Next question.
[01:13:39] I'm a huge fan of the podcast, and I'd like your advice.
[01:13:45] When I was younger, I joined the National Guard in an attempt to do something with my
[01:13:49] life and get out of depression.
[01:13:52] I lost my discipline and goals after basic training and continued in depression and disorganization.
[01:13:59] I had the opportunity to go to fight to flight school, but instead tested positive on
[01:14:05] a drug test, and I was given a general discharge.
[01:14:09] I, of course, take full responsibility and feel like an idiot.
[01:14:12] How would you recommend moving past this failure?
[01:14:16] What would you have done if your seal career ended with a mistake?
[01:14:23] Well, if my seal career had ended with a mistake, I would have figured out what my next
[01:14:29] mission was going to be.
[01:14:32] That's what I've done.
[01:14:34] I mean, I would have said, OK, I like that job.
[01:14:37] I failed at it.
[01:14:39] What can I learn from that?
[01:14:40] And what can I do next differently to make sure I don't make that mistake again?
[01:14:46] I'm going to learn from the past, but I'm not going to dwell on it.
[01:14:49] There's no point in dwelling on it.
[01:14:51] The only point in dwelling on just to learn from it.
[01:14:53] So that's what I would do here.
[01:14:55] Then I would take what I learned from my experiences of where I failed.
[01:15:02] But I would also take the positive things that I learned because even that failure is a positive.
[01:15:08] Even that failure is a positive because you realize the value of the opportunity that you
[01:15:12] had and you blew it and you're like, OK, I'm never going to let that happen again.
[01:15:15] Lesson learned.
[01:15:16] I'm actually stoked I get to learn that lesson because it's going to be more opportunities
[01:15:20] that come up in life.
[01:15:21] And you got to make sure that you don't disregard those opportunities when they come up.
[01:15:28] So I would have taken those lessons learned, take that failure, and turn it into something
[01:15:32] positive, and made good things happen.
[01:15:34] When I figured out what my new mission to new career was going to be pretty straightforward.
[01:15:41] You can do so much good.
[01:15:44] Anyhow, that's going back to the story that I told about Jeff in the beginning of this podcast.
[01:15:50] One of the wording, some of the wording that I struggled with in the kid's story, and
[01:15:57] getting it's on the, it's the word your kid podcast.
[01:15:59] One of the things that I struggled with in telling the story was I ended up saying Jeff had gone
[01:16:05] too far and he couldn't correct himself.
[01:16:09] He had gone too far and he couldn't come back.
[01:16:13] And that's a real hard thing to tell a person and it's a real hard thing to tell a kid.
[01:16:22] And the reason why I left it that way, the reason why I kept it like, listen.
[01:16:27] You can make mistakes that you can't come back from, especially as a kid.
[01:16:34] You can make mistakes that you can't come back from.
[01:16:36] They're pretty rare, right?
[01:16:38] There's not too many mistakes that are so grievous that you can't recover from them.
[01:16:41] Like this guy.
[01:16:42] Hey man, he made a mistake.
[01:16:45] Failed a drug test, given a general discharge.
[01:16:47] That sucks.
[01:16:48] Guess what?
[01:16:49] He can do all kinds of good in the world.
[01:16:51] He can make up for that 10 fold.
[01:16:53] He can start a business, make money, he can create a family, he can raise great kids.
[01:16:57] And there's so many things that he can make sure his kids understand that and know that
[01:17:02] and learn from it.
[01:17:03] And he can make sure some other neighborhood kids and high school kids and grade school
[01:17:07] kids.
[01:17:08] He can make such an impact on the world by learning from that mistake.
[01:17:11] So it's very, it's a harsh thing to say like, hey, there's some things you can't.
[01:17:16] Now what this guy can't recover from.
[01:17:19] And this is what the fact that you have to face.
[01:17:23] And this is why I told it this way in the kid's story.
[01:17:26] He didn't understand.
[01:17:27] When he made that mistake, he didn't understand that there's some mistakes you cannot
[01:17:31] recover from.
[01:17:32] He can't be a pilot now.
[01:17:35] It's not going to happen.
[01:17:36] Zero chance of him being a military pilot.
[01:17:39] That's the way it works.
[01:17:41] So if I would have had the opportunity to tell him when he was 13 years old, hey, listen,
[01:17:45] bro, I get it.
[01:17:47] You're going to step outside the box sometimes.
[01:17:49] But there's some mistakes that you can make that you'll never be able to recover from.
[01:17:52] So think about what you're doing before you do them.
[01:17:54] You need to think about what you're doing before you do them.
[01:17:57] And if I would have had the opportunity to tell him that when he was 13 years old, he
[01:18:01] might have had a better decision making process when he got older.
[01:18:04] That's why I left it that way for those kids so that they recognize that there are some
[01:18:08] things that you do as a person, as a kid, that you cannot recover from.
[01:18:14] You cannot recover from them.
[01:18:17] Now that being said, when you take this and you put it in perspective as an adult,
[01:18:22] see an adult, you have much broader world to be a part of.
[01:18:26] And just because he's not going to be a pilot, a military pilot, by the way, just because
[01:18:32] he's not going to be a military pilot, there's all kinds of other opportunities out there.
[01:18:35] And you can explain that to an adult, but it's hard to explain that to a kid.
[01:18:39] So one of the opportunities, I mean, even if especially like, oh, you want to be a pilot,
[01:18:42] cool, you can become a civilian pilot.
[01:18:44] And you can fly, you can make things happen that way.
[01:18:49] But what we're not going to do and what I would not do is do well on the past and do
[01:18:54] well on what the big missed opportunity is because guess what, that's a missed opportunity
[01:18:59] that there's all kinds of people in the world would love for that to be their biggest
[01:19:03] mistake that they've made.
[01:19:04] That's it.
[01:19:05] They would love there's someone sitting in prison right now.
[01:19:08] That's like, man, I wish all I did was get a failure drug test and I could have learned
[01:19:12] my lesson instead.
[01:19:13] I'm sitting here in prison or I got injured really bad because I did something that I
[01:19:19] shouldn't have done or I made a bad decision or I got someone that I care about, hurt
[01:19:23] or injured because I took them into, you know, car when I was drunk.
[01:19:27] Like those are the kind of mistakes.
[01:19:28] This mistake.
[01:19:29] Sure, it's a bummer.
[01:19:30] Guess what?
[01:19:31] They're infinitely infinitely worse mistakes that he could have made.
[01:19:35] infinitely worse.
[01:19:37] So you're all right, man.
[01:19:40] You're okay.
[01:19:42] Learn from it.
[01:19:43] Don't dwell on it.
[01:19:44] Move on and go, go do something really positive in the world.
[01:19:48] Yeah.
[01:19:49] Next question.
[01:19:53] Hey, Jockel.
[01:19:56] What can we do with a coworker who isn't on board when someone brings up something to him?
[01:20:02] He gets defensive and turns it into being everyone else's problem.
[01:20:06] Hmm.
[01:20:07] This is a Twitter question by the way.
[01:20:11] And I answered it and I answered it really simply, really straightforward.
[01:20:15] Take ownership of the problem and solve it.
[01:20:18] Take ownership of the problem and fix it.
[01:20:20] Yeah.
[01:20:21] Because think about what's happening here.
[01:20:24] What the person is saying, like, oh, this is me saying, oh, echo won't take ownership
[01:20:28] of the problem.
[01:20:29] Every time I tell him he does something wrong, he just gets defensive.
[01:20:32] So I mean, obviously, I'm not communicating with you well enough.
[01:20:36] If all I'm doing is blaming you and you're getting defensive and by the way, if I'm
[01:20:40] the type of person that takes ownership of things, why am I blaming you in the first place?
[01:20:44] I should be looking at myself.
[01:20:48] I should be looking at myself and by the way, if echo, if you point your fingers at me and
[01:20:51] you say, hey, this is my fault, you know what I say?
[01:20:53] Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:54] It is my fault.
[01:20:55] And here's what I'm going to do to fix it.
[01:20:57] Now I'm not going to rub it in your face.
[01:20:59] I'm not going to do it, so I prove a point.
[01:21:02] That's not what I'm doing.
[01:21:03] I'm actually doing it because I want to win.
[01:21:05] I'm actually doing it because I want to accomplish this mission.
[01:21:07] That's why I'm going to fix the problem.
[01:21:11] Now if we have a weak member of the team that doesn't take ownership, then guess what?
[01:21:15] It's my responsibility to take ownership of the problem and fix it.
[01:21:17] And eventually, but the good thing about this is if you make an excuse about something and
[01:21:21] I fix that excuse.
[01:21:22] And then you make an excuse about something else, I fix that one.
[01:21:25] And then you make an excuse about something else and I fix that one.
[01:21:27] Eventually, there's no more excuses for you.
[01:21:30] And now you're left with what you can actually handle as echo with no more excuses to make.
[01:21:37] And then either you're capable or you're not.
[01:21:38] And by the way, guess what? As the leader, then it's becomes my job to get rid of you.
[01:21:45] If you cannot do the thing that I asked you to do or that you're supposed to do for the
[01:21:50] team.
[01:21:52] So yeah, because eventually, if I keep stepping up and taking things away from you, there's
[01:22:00] not going to be any more excuses.
[01:22:01] And you'll either end up with no responsibility and therefore no value and then you have
[01:22:06] no job.
[01:22:07] That's the way it works.
[01:22:08] Now, let me ask you this.
[01:22:13] When is there a time that a subordinate does something and it's not the leader's fault?
[01:22:24] So think about this.
[01:22:27] And when something goes wrong with a team member, when is it not the leaders of fault?
[01:22:37] So if you got a machine gunner and the machine gunner shoots outside of his field of
[01:22:43] fire, clearly he didn't pay attention during the brief.
[01:22:47] That's the problem.
[01:22:49] If I have a machine gunner, that engages non-hospital targets.
[01:22:54] This machine gunner's fault because he didn't do improper.
[01:22:57] He did improper positive identification of his targets and engaged a friendlies or at least
[01:23:05] non-hospitals.
[01:23:06] So that's the machine gunner's fault.
[01:23:07] Or the machine gunner's weapon goes down because the machine gunner didn't clean.
[01:23:13] It's his fault because he didn't clean his weapon.
[01:23:15] Maintain his weapon properly.
[01:23:16] The machine gunner's fault.
[01:23:17] So all those things.
[01:23:19] The machine gunner shoots out of his field of fire.
[01:23:20] The machine gunner engages non-hospital targets.
[01:23:22] The machine gunner's weapon goes down.
[01:23:24] All those are the machine gunner's fault.
[01:23:25] Clearly.
[01:23:29] Or maybe not so clearly.
[01:23:32] Because here's how I would look at those things.
[01:23:35] That's by the way, if you're my machine gunner, I put my finger at you and start yelling
[01:23:38] at you and telling you that you did something wrong.
[01:23:40] Obviously we know what happens.
[01:23:41] You start making excuses and blaming other people and you don't accept irresponsible
[01:23:47] because you get defensive and that's what people do.
[01:23:49] So for me and what a good leader does is a good leader when the machine gunner shoots
[01:23:56] out of his field of fire, the leader says, oh, you know what?
[01:23:59] I didn't explain the fields of fire clearly enough for you.
[01:24:03] I'm sorry.
[01:24:04] I'll fix it.
[01:24:05] The machine gunner engages on non-hospital target.
[01:24:08] Then the leader says, hey, I should have given you better training on target identification.
[01:24:14] We will go back and fix that.
[01:24:18] Or the machine gunner's weapon goes down.
[01:24:21] It means that, hey, as the leader, you know what?
[01:24:23] I should have done a better job inspecting weapons.
[01:24:27] I should have explained how important the maintenance was.
[01:24:30] That's my fault.
[01:24:31] I won't let it happen again.
[01:24:34] So even in these instances where it's real easy to blame the individual, a good leader
[01:24:40] instead of blaming the individual will take ownership of the problem.
[01:24:47] That's what you do and that's what's going on in this case.
[01:24:49] You've got a coworker that's not on board and just gets defensive and turns into everyone
[01:24:53] else's problem.
[01:24:54] That's right.
[01:24:56] Grab ownership of those problems.
[01:24:58] And by the way, the support that's not taking ownership, that's your fault as a leader.
[01:25:03] And the way that you get someone to take ownership isn't by saying, hey, don't get
[01:25:08] defensive.
[01:25:09] You need to take ownership of this problem.
[01:25:10] That doesn't make people take ownership.
[01:25:14] Here's the tricky part.
[01:25:15] Here's the black belt situation.
[01:25:18] The black belt situation is if I want you to take ownership instead of blaming you,
[01:25:22] I'm going to take ownership of the problem.
[01:25:24] I'm going to relieve you of that.
[01:25:28] And now you're going to go out.
[01:25:29] No, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:30] I should be able to fix that.
[01:25:31] I'm sorry boss.
[01:25:32] I'm sorry, Jockel.
[01:25:33] I should just shop my, I shouldn't have shot outside the field of fire.
[01:25:36] I need to pay better attention during the brief.
[01:25:38] If I don't know what it was, I'm going to ask questions next time.
[01:25:41] Are you sure?
[01:25:42] Yes, I'm sure.
[01:25:43] Please.
[01:25:44] Let me get it fixed.
[01:25:46] And that is how you get someone to take ownership.
[01:25:49] You don't get people to take ownership by telling them to take ownership of things.
[01:25:53] And there's a little dichotomy here, too.
[01:25:56] Because if it's a plan, then the way I get you to take ownership of it is by saying,
[01:26:00] hey, echo, come up with a plan.
[01:26:02] We talked about standard operating procedures earlier.
[01:26:04] If I come up with a standard operating procedure myself and then I force them onto you,
[01:26:07] you don't take ownership of those.
[01:26:09] Those are mine.
[01:26:10] So I have to give you ownership.
[01:26:12] But when it's a negative, it's one of the positive things I give it to you.
[01:26:14] When it's a negative thing, I take it.
[01:26:21] I take it.
[01:26:23] Positive thing?
[01:26:24] Give it.
[01:26:25] Because people want that positive thing.
[01:26:28] And it's a negative thing they don't want it, you take it from them.
[01:26:33] And by the way, when it's a positive thing, and you give it to them, guess what they want
[01:26:36] to do with it?
[01:26:37] They want to share it.
[01:26:38] They want to do it.
[01:26:39] When it's a negative thing, and you force on them, they want to get rid of it.
[01:26:45] So there you go.
[01:26:47] I'm glad that this person's in the game.
[01:26:50] And now they know on a handle, let's cut work here and make it into a good situation.
[01:26:54] I think we got time for one more.
[01:27:01] Last question.
[01:27:02] Jocca.
[01:27:03] Hey, Jocca.
[01:27:04] How do you implement change when you know it is needed?
[01:27:11] How do you implement change when you know what is needed to well?
[01:27:19] And I know I need to change something.
[01:27:23] What I do is I change it.
[01:27:28] That's what I do.
[01:27:29] I change it.
[01:27:31] And I've had people that listen to the podcast, and they've reached out to me over the past
[01:27:37] few years.
[01:27:39] And one of the main messages that they took and put into action was actually putting things
[01:27:48] into action.
[01:27:50] Whatever that was, they stopped eating sugar.
[01:27:54] They stopped sleeping in.
[01:27:56] They started waking up early.
[01:27:58] They quit playing video games for 10 or 12 or 14 hours a day.
[01:28:04] They sold that Xbox thing.
[01:28:07] There was a guy that bit his nails for his whole life.
[01:28:13] He's like 30s.
[01:28:15] Hey, whatever.
[01:28:16] No big deals.
[01:28:17] You know, he bit his nails.
[01:28:18] Oh, you know what?
[01:28:19] His nails are all chewed up in their bloody and their gross look in it.
[01:28:22] He's self conscious when he's meeting people and shaking hands.
[01:28:25] And he can't keep his hands away from his mouth while he's in meetings or interacting
[01:28:30] with people.
[01:28:33] But he couldn't stop.
[01:28:37] And then he stopped.
[01:28:39] He just stopped.
[01:28:41] And the list goes on.
[01:28:43] There's people that are quite drinking and quit doing drugs and quit losing their
[01:28:48] temper and I've heard from so many different people that have implemented change in their
[01:28:55] lives, so so many letters and messages and notes.
[01:29:01] And I want you to know that these people aren't a bunch of elite special operations warriors.
[01:29:08] That's not who they are.
[01:29:09] They aren't a bunch of high level athletes or highly screened and highly trained individuals.
[01:29:18] These are just just normal people.
[01:29:23] Really.
[01:29:25] But they're normal people that knew they needed to make a change.
[01:29:32] And they decided they were going to make a change and then they made it.
[01:29:42] And that is what I do and that is what you can do too.
[01:29:51] If you have something to change, if you want to change something, change it, change it.
[01:30:05] Wow.
[01:30:14] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:30:16] So echo speaking of implementing change and change in our lives to become a little bit
[01:30:27] better.
[01:30:28] Maybe you could help us with some things that can make us better.
[01:30:32] Sure.
[01:30:33] First, what's up with Mike in the Dragons?
[01:30:35] Mike in the Dragons.
[01:30:36] Yes.
[01:30:37] So Mike in the Dragons is released into the world.
[01:30:44] Now, okay.
[01:30:45] So speaking of ownership and I know one of the earlier questions was about ownership and
[01:30:50] I have to take ownership myself at this time because I made a mistake.
[01:30:57] I made a mistake.
[01:30:58] Just as I, as you pointed out, as I've talked about my publisher not ordering enough
[01:31:05] books and how, hey, they don't order enough books.
[01:31:08] They don't get it.
[01:31:09] Well, guess what?
[01:31:10] I didn't order enough books.
[01:31:14] So I am getting them printed right now.
[01:31:18] I'm getting them printed as fast as humanly possible.
[01:31:23] We have multiple printers working.
[01:31:26] And if you ordered early, you're likely going to get yours on the release date.
[01:31:31] And I know some people have been posting their Amazon images that their Mike in the Dragons
[01:31:36] is shipping.
[01:31:37] So some people are going to get it soon.
[01:31:41] But even that's not a guarantee at this point.
[01:31:43] Even if you ordered early, I apologize.
[01:31:45] Don't blame Amazon.
[01:31:47] It's not their fault.
[01:31:48] Don't blame FedEx and don't blame the post office and don't blame UPS.
[01:31:51] It's not their fault.
[01:31:52] If you don't get the book on time, it is one person's fault.
[01:31:56] And that is mine.
[01:31:57] I should have done a much better job of estimating how many books you will all were going
[01:32:03] to buy.
[01:32:04] And I guess as soon as I saw people that were ordering 12 books, 12 Mikey in the Dragons,
[01:32:11] that should have been real indicator that I should have gotten more printed.
[01:32:15] But I didn't do that.
[01:32:17] I apologize.
[01:32:19] You guys have ordered a ton.
[01:32:21] And so at this point, I have a ton more being printed.
[01:32:25] Our goal is to get them to you by Christmas.
[01:32:27] It should be possible.
[01:32:29] If you order now, we've got enough coming in.
[01:32:31] They should be there to get in the stockings for Christmas.
[01:32:36] If you've ordered, so if you've ordered though, be patient.
[01:32:42] If you haven't ordered yet order like right now, so that I can print more.
[01:32:50] And like I said, right now, we should have enough.
[01:32:52] If you order right now, you should be able to get it by Christmas.
[01:32:58] And if you want it, yeah, just order it.
[01:33:02] And I'll just get as many printed as we need.
[01:33:04] I apologize.
[01:33:06] It's definitely my fault.
[01:33:08] I was weak.
[01:33:10] I was, you weren't weak.
[01:33:11] No, what was I used to call it weak?
[01:33:13] And then you'd be like, they're just being conservative.
[01:33:15] So I was too conservative.
[01:33:16] I balanced it too much in the wrong direction.
[01:33:21] So order the book.
[01:33:23] And I appreciate the few people that I've sent a copy to, the feedback has been awesome.
[01:33:30] The book in the words of John Bosch, who did the drawing into the art.
[01:33:35] And you're going to see, he's the same guy that the art for way the warrior kid.
[01:33:39] This art is a totally different deal because it's beautiful.
[01:33:43] It's color.
[01:33:44] It's vibrant.
[01:33:45] vibrant.
[01:33:46] Yeah, he did an amazing job.
[01:33:49] And he said to me, he's like, any old people say things and they say it in a certain way.
[01:33:58] He did that.
[01:33:59] He just goes, this book is special.
[01:34:04] And I was like, you know the way he said it was like, and I feel that way, but you know,
[01:34:09] of course, I'm biased because I wrote it.
[01:34:12] But when he drew it, so he's biased too.
[01:34:15] But he didn't say it like, hey, this book is awesome.
[01:34:17] Normal voice.
[01:34:19] He was like, he was like, hey, this book is, this book is really special.
[01:34:24] And I was like, okay, so I think this book is going to be on every kid's bookshelf.
[01:34:29] I think it's going to be right next to their copy of where the wild things are.
[01:34:33] That's what I think, which was one of all of our favorite books when you're a kid.
[01:34:37] And I know that's a bold statement.
[01:34:38] But anyways, I think it's going to have a great impact on kids.
[01:34:41] So if you want a copy for your kids, for your neighbor kids, for your library, your school,
[01:34:46] whatever classrooms, for yourself, for yourself.
[01:34:52] Yes, if you're 38 years old, and you want to learn a little something about the world,
[01:35:01] about overcoming fear, about how to face things.
[01:35:03] And you want to have it put in such a clear way, then get yourself a copy.
[01:35:10] So right, echo, then you've read it.
[01:35:13] I mean, obviously.
[01:35:14] Yes or how. And you've read it to your youngsters.
[01:35:17] Yes, I have.
[01:35:18] And they're approved.
[01:35:20] Approved.
[01:35:21] Yeah, she wants me to read it again.
[01:35:22] Okay.
[01:35:23] Well, this one, this is a book that takes 20 minutes to read.
[01:35:27] Yeah, maybe 20, maybe yeah, but around 20 minutes to read.
[01:35:30] Yeah.
[01:35:31] So it rhymes, which is fun.
[01:35:35] Yes.
[01:35:36] And impactful in little kids.
[01:35:38] They love it when those things rhyme.
[01:35:40] Yeah, yeah, they fought.
[01:35:41] Yeah.
[01:35:42] They follow it.
[01:35:43] So there you go.
[01:35:44] If you want one again, I apologize if you're not, if you don't get it on the 15th of November,
[01:35:49] my goal is to add a minimum.
[01:35:51] Some of you are going to get it on the 50th of you order it early.
[01:35:53] Hopefully you'll get it by then.
[01:35:54] But my goal, let's get it to you by Christmas.
[01:35:57] I've got publishers all over our printers all over printing it.
[01:36:02] So thank you.
[01:36:04] And that's that.
[01:36:07] Mike, you and the dragons.
[01:36:08] Cool.
[01:36:09] What else?
[01:36:10] What else we need?
[01:36:11] Well, how else can we implement change in our lives?
[01:36:14] Sure.
[01:36:15] Well, let you just talk today.
[01:36:16] Once you know the way broadly you will, in fact, see it in all things.
[01:36:24] So when you are exploring the road of jujitsu, you're going to need a key.
[01:36:31] Even if you do just no get well, if you don't, if you only do no get that I guess you don't
[01:36:34] need a key.
[01:36:35] But when you are searching for a key, get it origin key.
[01:36:40] That's it.
[01:36:41] 100%.
[01:36:42] Yeah.
[01:36:43] You origin main dot com.
[01:36:44] That's where you get it.
[01:36:45] Rushcards and there's well on the river.
[01:36:47] Moving in America.
[01:36:49] In America.
[01:36:50] Cotton.
[01:36:51] All the cotton.
[01:36:52] Grown in America.
[01:36:53] In America.
[01:36:54] And in America.
[01:36:55] In America.
[01:36:56] By the way, it's not just cotton.
[01:36:57] It's a special blend.
[01:36:59] Yeah.
[01:37:00] And a special weave by the way.
[01:37:01] No, it's special weave.
[01:37:02] How cool is that weave?
[01:37:03] Like, like, no kidding.
[01:37:04] When you see dragon weave for the first time, are you not like a little bit?
[01:37:09] A little bit.
[01:37:10] Impressive.
[01:37:11] Yeah.
[01:37:12] Use a thing too when you kind of been in the game for a long time.
[01:37:15] Let's say you're not easily impressed by Giz.
[01:37:18] Well, no, yeah.
[01:37:20] No, not generally speaking, no.
[01:37:22] But you do pay attention.
[01:37:23] Like you don't when you grab a Giz, you're own Giz.
[01:37:25] You're really used to your own Giz.
[01:37:26] If you have two Giz, three Giz, four Giz and they're all kind of different ways, you know
[01:37:29] those, right?
[01:37:30] So when you see someone else with a Giz, you're like, okay, you know, I'm familiar with
[01:37:34] whatever.
[01:37:35] Cool.
[01:37:36] But when you grab the dragon weave for the first time, especially when you've been in the
[01:37:39] game for a while, you're like, ooh, this one is different.
[01:37:41] Like that.
[01:37:42] Well, I've definitely had a couple of people that only got into Giz.
[01:37:45] Like they've only, Dave Burke.
[01:37:47] Good to do it.
[01:37:48] Yeah.
[01:37:49] He's only had origin Giz.
[01:37:50] It's just, he's just, he's just, he's just, he doesn't even know what.
[01:37:53] All these other stories about bad Giz, he doesn't even understand the stories.
[01:37:56] Like, oh, oh, they just, they're stinking.
[01:37:59] They're heavy and all they written.
[01:38:01] Oh, that's stuff.
[01:38:02] He doesn't know anybody better than you.
[01:38:03] Yeah.
[01:38:04] Yeah.
[01:38:05] Yeah.
[01:38:06] Yeah.
[01:38:07] So in a way, I kind of want to say, hey, dang, that's good for him.
[01:38:09] He's lucky in that way.
[01:38:10] But, hey, that's part of the game.
[01:38:13] It's part of the journey.
[01:38:14] Yeah.
[01:38:15] Nonetheless, whether you do it or not, you do it, drag and leave is legit.
[01:38:18] Are we allowed to talk about that new weave that we were exploring the other day at
[01:38:22] your house?
[01:38:23] Not yet.
[01:38:24] Okay.
[01:38:25] We're going to keep our beaks buttoned.
[01:38:27] Yeah.
[01:38:28] Don't forget about rash guards, though.
[01:38:30] Yes, of course.
[01:38:31] So when you're doing no guis, some people that use the t-shirt, I dig it.
[01:38:34] Some people that use the dry fit.
[01:38:35] I dig it.
[01:38:36] To me, rash guard is the way to go.
[01:38:38] This is why.
[01:38:40] Because other people's toes, sometimes not all the time, could get caught in that shirt
[01:38:45] when it's flopping around the wind.
[01:38:48] True.
[01:38:49] And, you know, hey, you know, it's a rash guard.
[01:38:50] It's cool.
[01:38:51] It looks more uniformy.
[01:38:52] What about the scientific compression increased?
[01:38:57] A fast-gatherty.
[01:38:58] I'm scared of that.
[01:38:59] Yeah.
[01:39:00] Not, hey, man, I'm sure there is that.
[01:39:01] There is that.
[01:39:02] Yeah.
[01:39:03] Oh, when you were the rash guard, when you were the compression clothing.
[01:39:07] Yeah, like, helps with that durian.
[01:39:08] And that's cool.
[01:39:10] I'm not over here making those plans.
[01:39:12] Yeah.
[01:39:13] I am making this claim.
[01:39:14] 19% improvement when you were in the rash guard.
[01:39:16] Based on your whole mental state.
[01:39:20] Yes.
[01:39:21] Agreed.
[01:39:22] Get some.
[01:39:23] Yeah.
[01:39:24] And not to mention, speaking of mental state, on those days that you don't want
[01:39:27] to train, get a new rash guard.
[01:39:29] Those days they don't exist anymore.
[01:39:32] And these ever formants.
[01:39:34] Then you need another new rash guard.
[01:39:36] Yeah, you're right.
[01:39:38] So yeah, cool.
[01:39:39] The compression.
[01:39:40] Cool.
[01:39:41] Yeah.
[01:39:42] He was actually starting to go into it with me.
[01:39:43] Hey, man, I could tell you, I'm like, well, man, let me go.
[01:39:46] It's good.
[01:39:47] We just go 19% improvement based on mental state.
[01:39:50] Getting after it.
[01:39:51] Yes.
[01:39:52] Agreed.
[01:39:53] So, yeah, some good rash guard down there.
[01:39:55] Also, some, well, how should I say lounge gear?
[01:39:59] Expression and so on.
[01:40:00] That violates your whole thing.
[01:40:02] The violates everything.
[01:40:03] Lounge.
[01:40:04] Anyway.
[01:40:05] So, luxury.
[01:40:06] You called luxury items.
[01:40:08] Get luxury.
[01:40:09] Get luxury.
[01:40:10] You'll go on here to talk about luxury.
[01:40:11] Oh, just the concept of luxury.
[01:40:12] Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:13] luxury days.
[01:40:14] Well, the sweats that they have are luxury.
[01:40:16] And here's the thing, unprompted.
[01:40:18] I go on Twitter.
[01:40:19] And you know, you get people when they get their stuff.
[01:40:21] They're like, hey, you know, you take a picture of your stuff.
[01:40:23] Normal.
[01:40:24] So, we go have a hoodie.
[01:40:25] And he'll say, this is the softest hoodie I ever had.
[01:40:29] That's the fact.
[01:40:30] That is the fact.
[01:40:31] Yeah.
[01:40:32] That is the fact.
[01:40:33] And then there's, I didn't understand this.
[01:40:35] And then there's the joggers.
[01:40:36] Yes.
[01:40:37] I didn't understand why they're called joggers.
[01:40:41] And what their purpose is.
[01:40:44] Old school sweat pants.
[01:40:47] They're just, they're as I can elastic.
[01:40:49] They're like straight cut.
[01:40:50] Then there's an elastic thing around the bottom.
[01:40:52] And then they're just all baggy.
[01:40:55] The purpose, apparently, did you tell me this?
[01:40:57] That joggers are cut tighter.
[01:40:59] And then they have like a tighter ankle.
[01:41:01] So you can actually jog in the neck of the purpose.
[01:41:03] Yes.
[01:41:04] I didn't know that.
[01:41:06] I had no idea.
[01:41:07] Yeah.
[01:41:08] So when you jog, they don't flap our un and the wind.
[01:41:09] It's not just that.
[01:41:10] It's a whole leg.
[01:41:11] So the whole leg kind of, it hears to your, it's more like fitted to your leg.
[01:41:15] And then they're more roomy in the hips.
[01:41:17] So you can have like, you know, you can spray it to jog, you can run, same scene.
[01:41:21] They just so happen.
[01:41:22] And that mobility that it allows for running translates 110%.
[01:41:28] To just cruising.
[01:41:29] When you land on them, I'm telling you, 100%.
[01:41:32] Pick it from me.
[01:41:33] I know.
[01:41:34] There's some supplements on there too.
[01:41:36] We got some, we got some supplements.
[01:41:37] There's a matter of fact.
[01:41:39] Good stuff.
[01:41:40] Joint warfare.
[01:41:43] Number one best seller.
[01:41:45] Joint warfare.
[01:41:46] Right.
[01:41:47] See why?
[01:41:48] Yeah.
[01:41:49] Crelloel.
[01:41:50] Yeah.
[01:41:51] What?
[01:41:52] Okay.
[01:41:53] So a lot of people ask this too.
[01:41:53] And you told, okay, the difference in how the people, so a guy would be like,
[01:41:57] hey, I work a physical job.
[01:41:59] Mm-hmm.
[01:42:00] Eight hours, 10 hours a day.
[01:42:01] I want to do work out of wherever my joints take kind of a beating.
[01:42:04] What should I take?
[01:42:05] Joint warfare or cruel oil.
[01:42:07] So people, they will wonder about that, which one should I take?
[01:42:09] Because they're both for your joint.
[01:42:10] Yeah.
[01:42:11] And the straight up answer is yes, take both of them.
[01:42:13] You should absolutely take both of them.
[01:42:15] If you can only get one.
[01:42:18] If you, I would say, if you're just feeling, what's the word?
[01:42:24] Like if you have like legitimate, soreness, real legit soreness, I would go with
[01:42:31] don't work for.
[01:42:32] But I like cruel.
[01:42:33] And I think it's, I've taken these things for so long together that I just, I don't
[01:42:39] know, it's hard for me to answer that.
[01:42:40] Yeah.
[01:42:41] Well, Brian would tell me that, cruel oil is for just general, you know, man, you know,
[01:42:48] you're getting this face it.
[01:42:49] You're getting older.
[01:42:50] And you know, you got a maintain.
[01:42:52] You got a maintain.
[01:42:53] It's not getting older.
[01:42:54] Yeah.
[01:42:55] I believe not.
[01:42:56] Yeah.
[01:42:57] And cruel oil together.
[01:42:58] Yeah.
[01:42:59] Like how you were saying, you know, your joints take a beating, like
[01:43:02] actual beating, or they kind of hurt now, then yeah, joint warfare, because they help
[01:43:06] inflammation.
[01:43:07] Well, actually, the cruel oil take.
[01:43:08] I got fired up today.
[01:43:09] I did my workout.
[01:43:11] I threw on the weight vest.
[01:43:13] Oh, yeah.
[01:43:14] And I just, I just pretended like I didn't have it on, but I had it on.
[01:43:17] From my workout.
[01:43:18] You know, that helps, you know, like that mental state to be like, so it's a difference
[01:43:22] between like, like, you can lift in these different ways too.
[01:43:26] But yeah, when you put weights on you, just like, you know, some people, they'll
[01:43:29] say, I don't know, so I'm going to baseball about something, they'll put a weight on there,
[01:43:32] or something like that.
[01:43:33] And mentally, if you, basically, you're training your functionality with that, and that
[01:43:37] resistance sort of just happens to be there.
[01:43:39] So your brain just kind of accommodates, you know, so when you function without the
[01:43:42] weight to just flying around, it's like, easiest, like, I weigh less now, you know, rather
[01:43:46] than then.
[01:43:47] Oh, I'm going to just eke out 10 reps of this very specific thing.
[01:43:50] Then you're training your body.
[01:43:51] Yeah, I kind of did this.
[01:43:52] I kind of did this little like a mental debate, like, oh, well, you know, I feel like
[01:43:56] I should, I should do something a little bit more.
[01:43:58] Maybe I'll do some rounds with this, and then I'll take it.
[01:44:00] And I'll just, no, I'm just going to do the whole thing like I just, and I did every
[01:44:03] exercise, even just completely unrelated exercises with with a weight vest on.
[01:44:08] Yeah, man, that's good.
[01:44:09] I was doing box jumps the other day, which I actually don't do that much, but like,
[01:44:13] idea, and I'll think, man, I think here's the morning on box jumps pay attention during
[01:44:16] box jumps.
[01:44:17] Oh, yeah.
[01:44:18] It's really easy, especially when you get, when you get smoked, and you start just kind
[01:44:21] of you're just going through the motions.
[01:44:23] And that's when you miss.
[01:44:24] Yeah.
[01:44:25] When you miss the box jump, you get that shinner.
[01:44:26] No fun.
[01:44:27] Yeah, and yes, and that's what I was thinking too.
[01:44:30] I was like, man, when I, because like, you know, this part of the mech, I was going back
[01:44:33] and forth.
[01:44:34] Yeah.
[01:44:35] It's a long thing, but box jumps part of it.
[01:44:38] And yes, towards those later rounds, I was like, okay, I better pay attention.
[01:44:42] Good.
[01:44:43] Yeah.
[01:44:44] And I was doing, I was adding a little something.
[01:44:45] You know, when you jump down, I went down into a little squat, then did the jump.
[01:44:49] So it's not just the box, it's like down squat, but yes, and made me think like,
[01:44:55] I could get a weight vest in really maximized these box jumps.
[01:44:59] Yeah, pay attention.
[01:45:00] Pay attention.
[01:45:01] Takes a discipline beforehand too, by the way, which is a little pre-mission
[01:45:05] get some.
[01:45:06] And then if you need food, if you need nutrients for your body and for your mind, then
[01:45:16] take mook.
[01:45:17] Yeah.
[01:45:18] Mook, tastes like, let's just, you know what I did yesterday?
[01:45:22] Sure.
[01:45:23] I took whipping cream.
[01:45:26] Heavy whipping cream.
[01:45:27] I think whipping cream, that you turn into whipped cream.
[01:45:31] But normally, what you put in a non-make whipped cream?
[01:45:34] Yes.
[01:45:35] What did you do?
[01:45:36] I don't know.
[01:45:37] What else do you have to do?
[01:45:38] I had an egg white in it.
[01:45:39] No.
[01:45:40] You got to add sugar.
[01:45:42] So recently, I read this thing that one of the whipped cream companies came out with
[01:45:49] like, Reese's Peanut Butter Whip Cream.
[01:45:53] And some other kind of whipped cream.
[01:45:55] So you get it in a spray can.
[01:45:57] You press the little nozzle.
[01:45:58] She worked.
[01:45:59] Boom.
[01:46:00] You got, Reese's Peanut Butter Flavor Whip Cream.
[01:46:03] And I thought to myself, yep, that sounds good.
[01:46:07] Boy, that's the freedom part.
[01:46:09] So guess what I did?
[01:46:11] I took heavy whipping cream that you make whipped cream with.
[01:46:15] And I put peanut butter moch in it.
[01:46:20] And I whipped it.
[01:46:21] And guess what?
[01:46:22] Well, it is good to go.
[01:46:26] People like getting something tasty.
[01:46:28] Tastyness.
[01:46:29] Tastyness.
[01:46:30] So yeah.
[01:46:31] And all of them taste great.
[01:46:32] All of them are awesome for you.
[01:46:35] And we got mint peanut butter.
[01:46:37] We got mint chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla.
[01:46:41] And of course, the darkness chocolate.
[01:46:43] And then warrior kid, warrior kid milk.
[01:46:47] Of which look, they both taste delicious.
[01:46:50] As a matter of fact, my son today, because it was getting cold.
[01:46:53] And I hate saying that because we're in California.
[01:46:56] Yeah, and cold.
[01:46:57] This is not cold.
[01:46:58] So everyone in Michigan, everyone peat the crew up and bathe.
[01:47:01] I apologize.
[01:47:02] Because it was getting cold this morning, which meant it was probably like 54.
[01:47:06] Yeah.
[01:47:07] Right?
[01:47:08] Which out here in California in Southern California, it's like, oh, it was cold this
[01:47:12] morning.
[01:47:13] It was a little chilly this morning, a little nipping the air.
[01:47:15] Of course, we're only wearing shorts in T-shirt.
[01:47:16] So in Maine, I know peats up there wearing a parka.
[01:47:22] But my son, he was jumping on his bike to go check the waves.
[01:47:27] And he had a little, he had a little like a coffee, a tumbler, one of our tumblers.
[01:47:32] And he doesn't drink coffee.
[01:47:33] And I was like, what are you doing?
[01:47:35] He goes, I made some hot cocoa milk.
[01:47:38] And I said, let me dry it.
[01:47:40] Wait, the warrior kid, let me dry it.
[01:47:41] The warrior kid.
[01:47:42] No, that was amazing.
[01:47:43] It's just delicious.
[01:47:44] It's just amazing.
[01:47:45] It's like a cocoa.
[01:47:46] Yeah, it's a cocoa.
[01:47:47] Except, I guess what?
[01:47:48] It's good for you and makes you strong.
[01:47:50] Yeah.
[01:47:51] What's up with that?
[01:47:52] What's up with that?
[01:47:53] So, yeah, that's the mole.
[01:47:55] Anyways, strawberries delicious.
[01:47:57] Get it for your kids.
[01:47:58] In my house, it seems to be the only thing anyone in my house is eating right now.
[01:48:02] So give that a shot and enjoy it.
[01:48:05] You're going to be in that, I think you might be.
[01:48:07] What's a parka?
[01:48:08] A parka is the coat.
[01:48:09] It's a big coat.
[01:48:10] We've got a winter coat.
[01:48:12] Yeah, you've ever seen a coat that has like a fur around the hood.
[01:48:15] Yes.
[01:48:16] It's sort of like the quintessential parka.
[01:48:19] I think the things are kind of dope.
[01:48:21] The word parka is kind of, kind of, if he.
[01:48:23] I think you've talked about it.
[01:48:24] I don't know.
[01:48:25] I've never heard the word.
[01:48:26] I'm saying, go.
[01:48:27] I mean, refresh your use.
[01:48:28] You're used to it.
[01:48:29] Bro, you're from Hawaii.
[01:48:30] I do know what a park is.
[01:48:31] You do not even see snow until like three weeks ago or something.
[01:48:35] No, for real, you didn't see snow until you were 30, right?
[01:48:38] Technically, I saw snow on the big island when I was a little kid one time.
[01:48:42] Yeah.
[01:48:43] And you go up in Manakia and you can see snow.
[01:48:46] We went up there with shorts and a tank top.
[01:48:48] By the way, we just drove up there.
[01:48:50] But since then, yes, I had not seen snow until I was 30.
[01:48:54] Yeah.
[01:48:55] So, you know, there's no possible way you're going to know what a park is.
[01:48:58] Yeah.
[01:48:59] So, yeah.
[01:49:00] So, which kind of is part of my point where if you've never really, I mean, I've heard the word parka,
[01:49:03] but I'm not used to what kind of entails and what the goodness of that.
[01:49:07] So, I'm just left with the word parka.
[01:49:10] And a park is as far as just the word doesn't seem like, I don't know, seems like a funny word.
[01:49:16] Well, put some context around it.
[01:49:19] Yeah.
[01:49:20] Freezing cold people, give them a parka.
[01:49:21] Nice, a little warm, functional parka.
[01:49:23] Yeah.
[01:49:24] Yeah.
[01:49:25] Yep.
[01:49:26] Man, I dig it.
[01:49:27] See, growing, you know, growth.
[01:49:29] We call that growth.
[01:49:30] I'm growing here.
[01:49:31] Trying to speak in a growth.
[01:49:33] You understand the path and represent at the same time.
[01:49:35] Grow in that way.
[01:49:37] Go to jocquistord.com.
[01:49:38] That's right.
[01:49:39] Jocquist is stored.
[01:49:40] So, you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts.
[01:49:43] Women tank tops, by the way.
[01:49:46] Mm-hmm.
[01:49:47] Work on men tank tops.
[01:49:48] Men's tank tops.
[01:49:49] I know the temperature is dropping.
[01:49:51] I'm not going to say it's cold here.
[01:49:52] I'm not going to say it.
[01:49:53] The temperature is lowering.
[01:49:56] You know?
[01:49:57] So, I dig it if you're not going to wear the tank top all the time.
[01:49:59] I dig it.
[01:50:00] But they're on there nonetheless.
[01:50:02] Uh, some hoodies.
[01:50:03] Mm-hmm.
[01:50:04] Either they're out now or they will be within one week from right now.
[01:50:08] T-shirts?
[01:50:09] T-shirts?
[01:50:10] T-shirts?
[01:50:11] How about that?
[01:50:12] Defkortissia.
[01:50:13] Oh, yeah.
[01:50:14] See, you're a group of people in the deaf culture.
[01:50:16] Right now.
[01:50:17] That's good, because it's a...
[01:50:19] I talked about, like, for me,
[01:50:23] to make a statement with what you're wearing is kind of just a little bit.
[01:50:28] I don't like that.
[01:50:29] It's too much.
[01:50:30] I'm not dressing to make a statement.
[01:50:31] It's my point.
[01:50:32] Yeah.
[01:50:33] I don't think all.
[01:50:34] I'm not dressing to make a statement.
[01:50:35] I wear the functionality is primary.
[01:50:37] Sure.
[01:50:38] So, I don't know if I thought this shirt is functional.
[01:50:41] Right.
[01:50:42] It is functional.
[01:50:43] It makes a subtle statement.
[01:50:44] I must admit.
[01:50:45] Well, even not making a statement is making a statement.
[01:50:48] It's kind of like...
[01:50:49] Let's really...
[01:50:50] Well, yeah, well, no way.
[01:50:51] You give you try too hard to not make a statement.
[01:50:52] And that's just...
[01:50:53] Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:54] Then your...
[01:50:54] The bigger's defeating it.
[01:50:55] Yeah, defeating the purpose.
[01:50:56] That's why this shirt...
[01:50:58] Settle.
[01:50:59] Statement made, mostly to yourself.
[01:51:01] There's not a statement to the world because people just look at this.
[01:51:03] We're not even think twice about it.
[01:51:04] Maybe they think one more time about it.
[01:51:06] Think what is that?
[01:51:07] Yeah.
[01:51:08] Well, if you're watching this on YouTube, they're going to notice that you're not wearing the victory.
[01:51:12] It's not going to be huge statement.
[01:51:13] And that's going to actually maybe even throw some people for a little loop.
[01:51:17] And...
[01:51:18] Nonetheless, yes, all on JoccoStore.com.
[01:51:22] Some cool rashguards on there as well.
[01:51:24] Some get out a little bit more.
[01:51:26] How should I say?
[01:51:27] Geared towards the specific path.
[01:51:30] I've got to get enough there.
[01:51:31] From the...
[01:51:32] There's technically one that literally says...
[01:51:35] Get after it.
[01:51:36] So I guess that's point.
[01:51:37] On point.
[01:51:38] Hey, subscribe to the podcast if you don't.

[01:51:48] Thank you.
[01:51:49] Also, the Warrior Kid podcast.
[01:51:51] We just put out a new one.
[01:51:53] I apologize that they come a little bit further apart than these.
[01:51:57] I've gotten many people that have said they have been listening to the first 18 Warrior Kid podcast over and over and over again.
[01:52:05] So I've got the literally lessons.
[01:52:07] And I appreciate the feedback on those.
[01:52:10] Also, you can go and don't forget your Warrior Kid soap from IrishOxRange.com.
[01:52:15] Young by...
[01:52:16] Made by Young Warrior Kid Aiden, who's making...
[01:52:20] JoccoSope.
[01:52:22] And his advice, which I totally agree with,
[01:52:25] is get some soap so you can stay clean.
[01:52:28] F*** it.
[01:52:29] YouTube.
[01:52:30] Don't forget about YouTube.
[01:52:32] Subscribe to the YouTube channel.
[01:52:34] So you can see echoes, legit videos.
[01:52:37] You can see if we have guests on.
[01:52:38] You can see who they are, what they look like, how they react, all that stuff.
[01:52:43] You can get a feel for...
[01:52:44] You can get to see what...
[01:52:45] If you don't know what echo looks like, he doesn't look like what he sounds like.
[01:52:49] So we've been told.
[01:52:51] Yeah.
[01:52:52] So you can see what echo looks like.
[01:52:53] And then you can put a comment that says...
[01:52:56] It can say, for instance, echo look in Jack.
[01:53:01] Sure?
[01:53:03] Or...
[01:53:04] Damn echoes, yoke.
[01:53:06] Or whatever.
[01:53:07] So there's a lot of those comments that make it on there.
[01:53:09] And I know that...
[01:53:10] That's basically the form of compensation that echo gets for his work.
[01:53:14] These people, sadly, people in YouTube comment saying,
[01:53:17] Echo's got Jack guns.
[01:53:20] So if you want to pay echo Charles, if you want to pay echo Charles,
[01:53:25] there's no Patreon account.
[01:53:27] There's no GoFundMe.
[01:53:29] You just go on to YouTube comments.
[01:53:31] And you write echo look in Jack, boy.
[01:53:34] Oh, so there you go.
[01:53:39] I've never covered.
[01:53:41] Also, psychological warfare.
[01:53:44] That's an album with tracks that we made,
[01:53:47] and I'm going to talk about the way I'm talking about.
[01:53:50] By the way, telling you how to get past through, get through, power through.
[01:53:55] Those moments of weakness when they arise.
[01:53:58] Which they do sometimes, by the way.
[01:53:59] I know you don't know this.
[01:54:00] Actually, you didn't know this, but they do arise.
[01:54:03] But if Joc was there telling you how to get through it,
[01:54:05] pragmatically, by the way.
[01:54:07] You'll get through it.
[01:54:08] I found that to be a fact.
[01:54:10] 100% of the time.
[01:54:12] Also, while you're doing your workout,
[01:54:14] you're going to go to onit.com slash jockel.
[01:54:17] And get new kettlebells.
[01:54:20] So I did totally revives your whole workout.
[01:54:23] In fact, do this.
[01:54:24] Do your normal workout.
[01:54:25] If in fact, you doesn't have kettlebells in the workout.
[01:54:27] Do your normal workout.
[01:54:28] And do a kettlebell.
[01:54:29] Like maybe like a five or ten minute one.
[01:54:31] Yeah, my son was asking me about working out.
[01:54:34] And he was kind of like, well, I just want to get like,
[01:54:38] like, like, what big muscles?
[01:54:41] Just get strong.
[01:54:43] And he can do the, or has done the kettlebell snatch.
[01:54:48] But I was like up the way a little bit and throw that thing up there.
[01:54:52] And I go every time you have to stop that thing in the top position,
[01:54:55] it's your whole body has to kind of put some effort into it.
[01:54:58] You will have, if you haven't done it before.
[01:55:01] And you go a little bit heavier than like what you,
[01:55:04] which I don't, you know, could be careful.
[01:55:06] But I'll blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[01:55:07] Okay.
[01:55:08] So if you go a little bit heavier, you will have like sore abs.
[01:55:11] You're abs will be sore.
[01:55:13] So you're post your your chain.
[01:55:15] Sure.
[01:55:16] Will be.
[01:55:17] Yeah, that's a real thing.
[01:55:18] I know it's a pro.
[01:55:19] You're post your your chain because there's people like,
[01:55:21] what do you want to do?
[01:55:22] No, so you're post your,
[01:55:23] tear your chain will be,
[01:55:25] get work, but believe it or not,
[01:55:27] your front and tear your,
[01:55:29] your and tear your chain will get work too because it has to,
[01:55:32] arrest.
[01:55:33] Yes.
[01:55:34] That weight, which is flying up there and then asked to stop,
[01:55:37] otherwise it ripped your shoulder out,
[01:55:38] which is why I should be careful.
[01:55:39] Don't go too heavy.
[01:55:40] But it's, and so my, you know, my bicycle is,
[01:55:43] it's killing.
[01:55:44] It's almost there man,
[01:55:45] or almost there.
[01:55:46] But one of the things I could straight up,
[01:55:48] not even start doing until very recently is kettlebells on that side.
[01:55:53] You know, because it slaps around.
[01:55:54] Yeah.
[01:55:55] It twist it, twist your wrist in this way that it really,
[01:55:58] it puts, so I even want to go on a light one.
[01:56:01] And it's weird because the pain is less there,
[01:56:03] more so than just kind of the raw,
[01:56:05] newness of my arm going through that whole kettlebell procedure.
[01:56:10] So I'm saying, so like, you know, when the thing comes up to a rest right here on your wrist,
[01:56:14] just it's sitting there on your wrist.
[01:56:16] It has to rest there and your wrist,
[01:56:18] your wrist is twisted in a certain way.
[01:56:19] You know, it's cool to normal if you don't,
[01:56:21] but man, it's weird the difference of my right hand,
[01:56:25] my good hand and my bad hand.
[01:56:26] Just the thing resting on the thing is like,
[01:56:28] you know, like, giving.
[01:56:30] So you lack the conditioning.
[01:56:32] Yeah, but conditioning is faded.
[01:56:33] Just in your little,
[01:56:34] just in your little pressure in the,
[01:56:36] yeah, yeah, yeah, toughness.
[01:56:37] The toughness.
[01:56:38] The toughness.
[01:56:39] I felt that the other day when we were rolling.
[01:56:41] Oh, that my toughness.
[01:56:43] Yeah, just like a, a dissension of toughness.
[01:56:45] Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, didn't see us.
[01:56:48] I was just, I was taking it light, you know, same thing.
[01:56:51] You're really happy with that.
[01:56:54] I'm just saying, I don't forget about Jockel White T.
[01:56:58] It is certified as the only beverage,
[01:57:02] whether you get it in the can or you get it in the bag,
[01:57:05] and you steep it yourself.
[01:57:07] Either way, it is the only beverage in the world
[01:57:10] that comes with a 100% money back guarantee of an 8,000 pound deadlift.
[01:57:15] Good.
[01:57:16] Which is really good.
[01:57:17] And it's organic, by the way.
[01:57:19] It's organic on top of that.
[01:57:21] It's something so tasty.
[01:57:23] And as the winter arrives,
[01:57:26] and it gets really cold.
[01:57:28] I am California, sorry.
[01:57:30] Yeah, my people of the north.
[01:57:33] To get that warm tea going, just put a couple bags.
[01:57:36] Now, some people worry about how long you should steep,
[01:57:38] do you know what steep the tea means?
[01:57:40] I do know, yeah.
[01:57:41] Okay, yeah.
[01:57:42] So how long should you steep the tea?
[01:57:44] In my opinion, when I put a tea bag in,
[01:57:46] it's not coming out.
[01:57:47] Oh, straight out.
[01:57:48] I just leave it in there.
[01:57:49] I'm just going to, I'm going to leave it in there.
[01:57:51] It's good to go to drink and you know, like a couple,
[01:57:53] like a minute, or maybe two minutes.
[01:57:55] But then I'm not taking that tea bag.
[01:57:57] I'm going to get all that, all that,
[01:57:59] all that pomegranate goodness, all that,
[01:58:01] all those antioxidants are coming right into my system.
[01:58:05] So I'll let you know.
[01:58:06] And it tastes delicious,
[01:58:08] and it does have caffeine in it.
[01:58:10] I will say.
[01:58:12] So the cans have 60 milligrams, depending on how long you steep.
[01:58:17] And I think when you steep it like I do,
[01:58:19] there's probably a little bit extra,
[01:58:21] a little bit of extra.
[01:58:22] Get some.
[01:58:23] Sure.
[01:58:24] Inside there.
[01:58:25] Steak is there.
[01:58:26] Also got some books.
[01:58:27] Okay, where the warrior kid?
[01:58:28] And Mark's mission.
[01:58:30] Those are two kids books,
[01:58:32] but I promise you that Uncle Jake has lessons for everyone.
[01:58:37] Yeah.
[01:58:38] Agreed.
[01:58:38] And I'm one of those people.
[01:58:40] And so I think when you read that to your kids,
[01:58:43] oh well, in my case,
[01:58:44] because I thought I can't quite read a book.
[01:58:47] Yeah.
[01:58:48] So I'll read it,
[01:58:49] but I feel like I'm reading to myself too.
[01:58:51] Like these are all things that I,
[01:58:52] some that you forget.
[01:58:53] I think as an adult,
[01:58:54] you forget a lot of these lessons.
[01:58:55] You know, because now you have a routine.
[01:58:57] As an adult,
[01:58:58] you have a routine.
[01:58:59] Some of these lessons.
[01:59:00] It feels like they don't apply it first, you know?
[01:59:02] So you kind of forget them and you're not.
[01:59:04] Man, I wish I could just incorporate that little thing.
[01:59:06] One of the fundamental laws of combat is simple.
[01:59:11] Yeah.
[01:59:12] And way the warrior kid is the,
[01:59:15] it's life rules.
[01:59:17] But fourth,
[01:59:18] in a very simple way that a young child could,
[01:59:21] understand them.
[01:59:22] But what surprising is in that simplicity,
[01:59:25] it hits anyone,
[01:59:27] solidly right between the eyes.
[01:59:32] So that's way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
[01:59:36] You can get those.
[01:59:38] Also about the discipline equals freedom,
[01:59:39] field manual.
[01:59:40] That's another one that if you,
[01:59:41] if you re, or if you refer to,
[01:59:43] it'll like remind you,
[01:59:44] because like,
[01:59:45] okay, so,
[01:59:46] man,
[01:59:47] I don't meditate.
[01:59:48] I don't.
[01:59:49] Like, you know, like,
[01:59:50] for like,
[01:59:51] okay,
[01:59:52] it's arguably,
[01:59:53] it's meditation.
[01:59:54] It's not, it's not,
[01:59:55] it's not meditation.
[01:59:56] You know what,
[01:59:57] they're talking about.
[01:59:58] So,
[01:59:59] from what I understand,
[02:00:02] if you meditate on certain things,
[02:00:04] they help like incorporate it into your,
[02:00:07] you know,
[02:00:07] your whole normal thought meditate,
[02:00:09] whatever.
[02:00:10] That's what I would start with,
[02:00:13] finally.
[02:00:14] But,
[02:00:15] and then you would need,
[02:00:16] and this is just my,
[02:00:17] my thought about meditation,
[02:00:19] you would need less reminders of certain things,
[02:00:22] you know,
[02:00:23] like,
[02:00:23] yes.
[02:00:24] How to,
[02:00:24] like,
[02:00:25] like,
[02:00:25] detach is,
[02:00:26] for whatever reason,
[02:00:27] what I understood,
[02:00:28] the,
[02:00:28] the concept of detach,
[02:00:30] and the importance of it.
[02:00:31] That's,
[02:00:32] that's to me,
[02:00:32] just kind of established itself as like,
[02:00:35] pre,
[02:00:35] one of the most important things
[02:00:37] that you can roll into your life,
[02:00:39] that'll improve it right away.
[02:00:40] That's like,
[02:00:41] right then in there.
[02:00:42] But,
[02:00:43] the thing,
[02:00:43] just like,
[02:00:44] you said,
[02:00:45] you got to notice when you got to detach,
[02:00:47] you know,
[02:00:48] it's not detached into the heart part.
[02:00:49] It's to notice,
[02:00:50] you know,
[02:00:51] it's time to go and,
[02:00:52] so for like a better term,
[02:00:53] you're forgetting to detach right now,
[02:00:55] because you're so distracted by all the feelings,
[02:00:56] whatever.
[02:00:57] So it's one of the,
[02:00:58] so the feel menu is like a really good one.
[02:01:00] So like,
[02:01:01] man,
[02:01:01] if you can refer to that boom,
[02:01:02] and this goes for all the subjects in there,
[02:01:04] by the way,
[02:01:04] like so like every day,
[02:01:05] even every other day,
[02:01:06] two,
[02:01:07] three days,
[02:01:07] whatever,
[02:01:08] just refer back to it,
[02:01:09] man,
[02:01:09] it helps.
[02:01:10] It keeps it on your mind,
[02:01:11] all these things.
[02:01:12] Yeah.
[02:01:12] It only does.
[02:01:13] People post pictures of,
[02:01:15] the feel manual.
[02:01:16] Yeah.
[02:01:17] Like one,
[02:01:17] like one page,
[02:01:18] two pages of it.
[02:01:19] And when I,
[02:01:21] whenever I,
[02:01:22] when someone posts a picture of that,
[02:01:23] I actually read,
[02:01:24] I wrote the book,
[02:01:25] but I still read this section and say like,
[02:01:27] and it,
[02:01:28] and I don't read it and go,
[02:01:29] oh,
[02:01:30] oh,
[02:01:30] I remember writing that.
[02:01:31] I actually go,
[02:01:31] I can do that better.
[02:01:32] Yeah.
[02:01:33] I want to do that.
[02:01:34] I need to focus,
[02:01:35] you know what I mean?
[02:01:36] Yeah.
[02:01:36] And you said good thing about that,
[02:01:37] where overwhelmed,
[02:01:38] right?
[02:01:39] That was one that,
[02:01:40] I don't even know who posted it first,
[02:01:42] but it was like,
[02:01:43] it's on front post today,
[02:01:44] and like,
[02:01:45] JP,
[02:01:46] maybe,
[02:01:47] yeah.
[02:01:48] Yeah.
[02:01:49] So that was one where it's like,
[02:01:50] you know why they're,
[02:01:51] you know why people are posting that,
[02:01:52] because when they read it,
[02:01:53] when they go,
[02:01:54] they refer to it.
[02:01:55] They're like,
[02:01:55] oh,
[02:01:55] click again.
[02:01:56] Let me,
[02:01:57] you know,
[02:01:57] because that's kind of the whole nature,
[02:01:58] post-leandings.
[02:01:59] So the boom,
[02:01:59] that's exactly what's happening.
[02:02:01] So it's like,
[02:02:01] boom,
[02:02:02] I need to remember that one.
[02:02:03] It's not like that's the first time they read it.
[02:02:04] Maybe it is,
[02:02:05] it's not,
[02:02:06] but most of the time,
[02:02:06] it's like,
[02:02:07] okay,
[02:02:07] I refer back to that.
[02:02:08] And they're going to be posted.
[02:02:09] So it's doing exactly what I'm saying.
[02:02:10] It's reminding you.
[02:02:11] Like,
[02:02:12] I'm so overwhelmed.
[02:02:21] And the,
[02:02:22] you know,
[02:02:23] certain ones apply to you at certain times,
[02:02:24] too,
[02:02:25] you know,
[02:02:25] so it's like,
[02:02:26] good man just to refer back to that.
[02:02:27] So did I do it?
[02:02:29] It will keep you on the path.
[02:02:30] If you want the audio version,
[02:02:31] it's not available on audible.com.
[02:02:33] It's available on iTunes,
[02:02:35] Amazon,
[02:02:36] music,
[02:02:37] Google,
[02:02:37] play in other MP3 platforms.
[02:02:39] Also extreme ownership.
[02:02:41] Every different type of organization.
[02:02:43] That's what everyone at echelon front does,
[02:02:46] which is our leadership consulting business,
[02:02:48] which is me and Lave Babin and J.P.D.D.
[02:02:51] and Dave Burke and Flynn Gawkerna and Mike Surelli and Mike Bima.
[02:02:55] That's what we do.
[02:02:56] We talk about the fundamental principles that are in that book,
[02:03:00] that we brought home from the battlefield.
[02:03:03] And that book,
[02:03:05] extreme ownership.
[02:03:06] After we got done writing that book and taught that stuff,
[02:03:09] we wrote another book.
[02:03:11] It's called the dichotomy leadership,
[02:03:13] which we also talked about a bunch of things.
[02:03:15] Because you can't talk about leading human beings
[02:03:19] without talking about extreme ownership.
[02:03:22] The fundamental principles of the laws of combat.
[02:03:26] And then when you start talking about that,
[02:03:28] you've got to talk about the dichotomy leadership.
[02:03:30] So those two books are also available.
[02:03:34] And what I like seeing is when I got just saw on today,
[02:03:38] Guy had probably posted a picture of 30 copies of the dichotomy leadership.
[02:03:42] He's like, this is going to the whole team.
[02:03:44] Because that's how you get everyone aligned.
[02:03:46] You make everyone see,
[02:03:48] oh, you know what?
[02:03:48] I'm going to think of this way.
[02:03:49] Now, some people go, oh, I don't want to share this secrets.
[02:03:53] They want to keep it for themselves.
[02:03:54] That doesn't help you.
[02:03:55] You don't do better.
[02:03:56] You do better if everyone understands the principles.
[02:04:01] That's going to make you do better as the leader.
[02:04:03] And by the way, if you're out there trying to do better for yourself,
[02:04:06] don't read the book, go and do something else.
[02:04:09] Because I don't even want you around.
[02:04:11] Oh, just for yourself.
[02:04:12] If you're just trying to look out for you,
[02:04:14] the principles aren't for you.
[02:04:16] You won't understand them properly.
[02:04:19] So, and yet, if you want to win,
[02:04:23] the best possible way to win,
[02:04:25] by the way, isn't by looking out for yourself.
[02:04:28] It's by looking out for the good of the team.
[02:04:30] It's by looking out for the mission.
[02:04:31] That's how you win.
[02:04:33] And that's what these books will help you do.
