00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jockel Podcast number 208.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.68
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:08.68
Good evening echo.

4
00:00:08.68 --> 00:00:12.24
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.24 --> 00:00:15.68
Let me have your attention.

6
00:00:15.68 --> 00:00:21.96
At this point, you must complete a 12-mile tactical foot march in three hours.

7
00:00:21.96 --> 00:00:24.68
You must wear all equipment properly.

8
00:00:24.68 --> 00:00:29.64
You must have Kevlar helmet on your head and you must carry your M16 rifle at the ready

9
00:00:29.64 --> 00:00:31.80
position.

10
00:00:31.80 --> 00:00:39.40
This means that the rifle must be ready for use against the enemy.

11
00:00:39.40 --> 00:00:45.60
Discuss appropriate safety precautions and candidates' responsibilities for helping injured

12
00:00:45.60 --> 00:00:47.72
candidates.

13
00:00:47.72 --> 00:00:52.96
Then say what are your questions?

14
00:00:52.96 --> 00:00:59.20
If anyone has questions, repeat the instructions, but do not elaborate on what you have

15
00:00:59.20 --> 00:01:01.84
read.

16
00:01:01.84 --> 00:01:10.96
Pause five seconds and then say begin.

17
00:01:10.96 --> 00:01:20.28
And those right there are the instructions to be given by the Cadre to candidates for the

18
00:01:20.28 --> 00:01:25.56
EIB, the expert infantry badge in the US Army.

19
00:01:25.56 --> 00:01:31.80
That's a qualification that requires knowledge and a plethora of different weapons,

20
00:01:31.80 --> 00:01:37.28
including pistols, rifles, machine guns, grenades, anti-tank weapons.

21
00:01:37.28 --> 00:01:44.04
It requires skill in combat medical care, skills in coordinating and calling for supporting

22
00:01:44.04 --> 00:01:51.72
arms, land navigation, chemical and biological operations amongst other things.

23
00:01:51.72 --> 00:01:57.16
And he 12-mile foot march.

24
00:01:57.16 --> 00:02:03.40
That is one of the evolutions that you are not allowed to retest on.

25
00:02:03.40 --> 00:02:05.20
You either make it or you don't.

26
00:02:05.20 --> 00:02:13.44
And that makes sense because the foot march, and I think that's really a nice way of saying

27
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:14.44
it.

28
00:02:14.44 --> 00:02:24.000
So what we used to call a forced road march is a physical and mental test of will.

29
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.20
And I talked about, I talked about the road march in podcast 38, the patrol, patroling

30
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:38.000
in teams, patrolling with my family.

31
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.40
And I started off that podcast with a little reading of infantry columns by Kipling.

32
00:02:47.40 --> 00:02:51.000
Boots.

33
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.96
And I explained that marching or humping or patrolling or rocking.

34
00:02:57.96 --> 00:03:01.92
I explained what it meant to me.

35
00:03:01.92 --> 00:03:07.96
How it impacted me and how in many ways it can be a bit of a metaphor.

36
00:03:07.96 --> 00:03:11.56
For life.

37
00:03:11.56 --> 00:03:15.64
And I'm not the only one who feels that way.

38
00:03:15.64 --> 00:03:25.32
And with me on the program tonight is a former special forces soldier who is also impacted

39
00:03:25.32 --> 00:03:31.000
by the patrol, by the hump, by the rock.

40
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.48
And who has made his new mission to spread the power of the rock.

41
00:03:39.48 --> 00:03:40.48
So here we go.

42
00:03:40.48 --> 00:03:41.48
Jason McCarthy.

43
00:03:41.48 --> 00:03:42.48
Welcome to program.

44
00:03:42.48 --> 00:03:44.48
Thanks for having me, Jaco.

45
00:03:44.48 --> 00:03:45.48
Thanks for coming on, man.

46
00:03:45.48 --> 00:03:46.48
Good to meet you.

47
00:03:46.48 --> 00:03:47.48
Likewise.

48
00:03:47.48 --> 00:03:48.48
Likewise.

49
00:03:48.48 --> 00:03:55.84
So let's just jump into figure out sort of how you ended up, how you ended up.

50
00:03:55.84 --> 00:03:57.000
Where did all start?

51
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Where are you born?

52
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Where are you raised?

53
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.84
Born in Dayton, Ohio.

54
00:04:00.84 --> 00:04:01.84
So Southern, Ohio.

55
00:04:01.84 --> 00:04:03.40
And but never really lived there.

56
00:04:03.40 --> 00:04:05.64
Mom and Dad were both really young when they had me.

57
00:04:05.64 --> 00:04:07.32
Mom was like, how young?

58
00:04:07.32 --> 00:04:08.76
Mom was 18 and five days.

59
00:04:08.76 --> 00:04:09.76
Dang.

60
00:04:09.76 --> 00:04:10.76
Right.

61
00:04:10.76 --> 00:04:11.76
So how old was Dad?

62
00:04:11.76 --> 00:04:12.76
Dad was 19.

63
00:04:12.76 --> 00:04:13.76
Okay.

64
00:04:13.76 --> 00:04:14.76
Right.

65
00:04:14.76 --> 00:04:20.08
And you know, as you might expect, marriage didn't last super long.

66
00:04:20.08 --> 00:04:23.84
Grandparents weren't super happy about this, but you know, they ended up taking very

67
00:04:23.84 --> 00:04:25.72
vested interest in me.

68
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:29.40
But my mom was actually, she was the real athlete in the family.

69
00:04:29.40 --> 00:04:34.68
She won Junior College Nationals in tennis after having me at Singlether Community College.

70
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:35.68
Wow.

71
00:04:35.68 --> 00:04:36.68
Right there.

72
00:04:36.68 --> 00:04:38.80
And then got a full ride to go play for the Gators Downing Gainesville.

73
00:04:38.80 --> 00:04:41.52
So we moved to Florida and then just bounced around.

74
00:04:41.52 --> 00:04:42.68
And so who was raising you?

75
00:04:42.68 --> 00:04:44.52
Why was my mom?

76
00:04:44.52 --> 00:04:51.08
And she's going to college winning national level tournaments in tennis and raising you.

77
00:04:51.08 --> 00:04:52.08
Yes.

78
00:04:52.08 --> 00:04:54.28
And so she's a bit of a trooper, huh?

79
00:04:54.28 --> 00:04:57.36
She's very much a trooper.

80
00:04:57.36 --> 00:04:58.36
Very much.

81
00:04:58.36 --> 00:05:02.80
You know, I mean, some of my earliest memories are going to her tennis practices and

82
00:05:02.80 --> 00:05:06.56
her tennis matches and my grandparents flying down to take care of me while she's.

83
00:05:06.56 --> 00:05:09.40
Now was she raised like a tennis kid?

84
00:05:09.40 --> 00:05:12.64
Yeah, sort of him in an athlete.

85
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:13.64
And just across the board.

86
00:05:13.64 --> 00:05:14.64
Just across the board.

87
00:05:14.64 --> 00:05:16.20
And then she ended up being really good at tennis.

88
00:05:16.20 --> 00:05:18.96
She was number one in Ohio, her whole youth.

89
00:05:18.96 --> 00:05:21.32
And so it just extended from there.

90
00:05:21.32 --> 00:05:25.36
When you're really good at something, you just have a kid.

91
00:05:25.36 --> 00:05:26.36
So was she in high school?

92
00:05:26.36 --> 00:05:27.36
Was she managed to do?

93
00:05:27.36 --> 00:05:29.36
Yeah, I mean, managed to.

94
00:05:29.36 --> 00:05:31.36
Was that like your senior year?

95
00:05:31.36 --> 00:05:32.36
Yes.

96
00:05:32.36 --> 00:05:40.12
So she ended up graduating early and then almost went into hiding sort of at my dad's house

97
00:05:40.12 --> 00:05:46.92
with my dad's parents who were a little more okay with the situation than my mom's parents.

98
00:05:46.92 --> 00:05:47.92
It was tough.

99
00:05:47.92 --> 00:05:48.92
No doubt.

100
00:05:48.92 --> 00:05:49.92
Yeah, no, it's tough.

101
00:05:49.92 --> 00:05:50.92
Can't even imagine.

102
00:05:50.92 --> 00:05:51.92
What year were you born?

103
00:05:51.92 --> 00:05:52.92
1979.

104
00:05:52.92 --> 00:05:53.92
Yeah.

105
00:05:53.92 --> 00:06:02.36
So society was still a lot more, I'd say, hard to deal with from that perspective

106
00:06:02.36 --> 00:06:04.72
of like a young mom in high school.

107
00:06:04.72 --> 00:06:06.72
I mean, single moms.

108
00:06:06.72 --> 00:06:09.28
I mean, that's tough.

109
00:06:09.28 --> 00:06:14.96
And the older I get, the more respect I have for how tough kids are and especially, you know,

110
00:06:14.96 --> 00:06:20.40
especially a single mom with a young kid and still trying to live your life and go to college

111
00:06:20.40 --> 00:06:23.32
and then get a job and do those kinds of things.

112
00:06:23.32 --> 00:06:25.60
So you have memories early on.

113
00:06:25.60 --> 00:06:29.64
You're like one year old and you're going to tennis tournaments with your mom.

114
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:35.28
Well, I was at all the other little 18, 19 year old college girls are like worried about their

115
00:06:35.28 --> 00:06:37.08
hair and your mom's like, hold on.

116
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:38.84
I'm just like, you're going to feed my kid.

117
00:06:38.84 --> 00:06:39.84
It's something like that.

118
00:06:39.84 --> 00:06:40.84
It's like a massive thing.

119
00:06:40.84 --> 00:06:46.44
I was two or three and I remember the tennis coach at Florida used to always pull my ear.

120
00:06:46.44 --> 00:06:50.08
Same as Andy Brandy and he would pull my ear before the matches and you say, are you going

121
00:06:50.08 --> 00:06:51.76
to behave today?

122
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:52.76
Right?

123
00:06:52.76 --> 00:06:58.24
It was, it inspired behavior that was good for me.

124
00:06:58.24 --> 00:07:04.52
Yeah, because like once again, I'm picturing these girls playing your mom and you know,

125
00:07:04.52 --> 00:07:08.84
they're worried if there's, there's some distraction over on the side is like a camera

126
00:07:08.84 --> 00:07:09.84
going off.

127
00:07:09.84 --> 00:07:13.000
Meanwhile, your mom's got the screaming baby.

128
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.80
That's not, man.

129
00:07:14.80 --> 00:07:16.000
She had a lot on her plate.

130
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.16
Yes, she did.

131
00:07:17.16 --> 00:07:22.36
And so then, and so at what point did she kind of give up tennis and move into?

132
00:07:22.36 --> 00:07:25.28
Or did she like become a tennis pro at a club or something like that?

133
00:07:25.28 --> 00:07:29.84
Yeah, so I mean, I'm convinced that without me, she would have at least tried to go pro.

134
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:36.44
And she was really good, you know, and she just, she had me and graduated in like 85.

135
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:41.68
So I would have been six years old when she graduated from Florida and you can't go

136
00:07:41.68 --> 00:07:45.64
graduate from Florida University of Florida in the States.

137
00:07:45.64 --> 00:07:51.72
And so instead, you know, she ended up getting remarried and did become a teaching

138
00:07:51.72 --> 00:07:54.80
tennis professional and did that for about 20 years.

139
00:07:54.80 --> 00:07:59.40
So yeah, we moved, we moved to Texas and Tennessee and back to Texas and then settled

140
00:07:59.40 --> 00:08:00.56
in in Jack's Beach floor.

141
00:08:00.56 --> 00:08:03.56
How old are you settled in Jack's Beach, Florida?

142
00:08:03.56 --> 00:08:05.56
We moved there in 1992.

143
00:08:05.56 --> 00:08:07.68
And what about how old were you?

144
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:08.96
So I was eighth grade.

145
00:08:08.96 --> 00:08:11.24
That's why I first year in school there.

146
00:08:11.24 --> 00:08:15.44
Sort of how I associate, I remember the grades where I was in which city.

147
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:19.20
Yeah, but so you did your full high school career in Jacksonville, Florida?

148
00:08:19.20 --> 00:08:20.20
I did.

149
00:08:20.20 --> 00:08:23.04
You were born and raised kind of with a tennis racket in your hand.

150
00:08:23.04 --> 00:08:24.04
I assume.

151
00:08:24.04 --> 00:08:25.04
Tennis racket in a basketball.

152
00:08:25.04 --> 00:08:26.04
Yeah.

153
00:08:26.04 --> 00:08:27.52
Tennis eventually won out.

154
00:08:27.52 --> 00:08:28.52
But how?

155
00:08:28.52 --> 00:08:31.32
I got caught from the eighth grade basketball team.

156
00:08:31.32 --> 00:08:33.92
So it's weird because that's the new kid.

157
00:08:33.92 --> 00:08:38.08
And I did really well in basketball when I'd moved from Texas.

158
00:08:38.08 --> 00:08:43.32
And I just moved to Florida and it just didn't click for tryouts and didn't know anybody.

159
00:08:43.32 --> 00:08:45.04
And they're like, sorry.

160
00:08:45.04 --> 00:08:47.32
And it was kind of a crushing blow.

161
00:08:47.32 --> 00:08:51.48
And this is not one of those things where the Michael Jordan story takes place.

162
00:08:51.48 --> 00:08:54.88
And I doubled down on my training in practice and became a great basketball player.

163
00:08:54.88 --> 00:08:55.88
I just gave up.

164
00:08:55.88 --> 00:08:56.88
Pick up, pick up so.

165
00:08:56.88 --> 00:08:58.24
But yeah, I quit.

166
00:08:58.24 --> 00:08:59.24
Jack, I quit.

167
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:00.88
I quit in his forever.

168
00:09:00.88 --> 00:09:03.08
And I quit.

169
00:09:03.08 --> 00:09:07.24
But I still played tennis and that was easier to make the team and stuff.

170
00:09:07.24 --> 00:09:09.16
So I did that and did that through college.

171
00:09:09.16 --> 00:09:10.68
So you played tennis in college?

172
00:09:10.68 --> 00:09:11.68
I did.

173
00:09:11.68 --> 00:09:14.60
One of my friends played tennis at the Naval Academy.

174
00:09:14.60 --> 00:09:19.56
And his sophomore year, he lost a match.

175
00:09:19.56 --> 00:09:25.44
And he stood in the court and threw his five tennis rackets out of the court into the woods

176
00:09:25.44 --> 00:09:27.72
and never played tennis again.

177
00:09:27.72 --> 00:09:28.72
Quitting forever.

178
00:09:28.72 --> 00:09:29.72
Yeah.

179
00:09:29.72 --> 00:09:30.72
Now I've been using the team.

180
00:09:30.72 --> 00:09:35.12
He was a great guy, but he just he never wanted to pick up a tennis racket again.

181
00:09:35.12 --> 00:09:37.84
And he had to be in the obviously to play at the Naval Academy.

182
00:09:37.84 --> 00:09:42.52
It had been a big focus in his life for a frustrating sport.

183
00:09:42.52 --> 00:09:46.04
It's a frustrating sport.

184
00:09:46.04 --> 00:09:51.44
It teaches you to make you very sensitive to what you think or your needs to.

185
00:09:51.44 --> 00:09:55.40
Because you're alone in your individual and you're out there and you take everything so

186
00:09:55.40 --> 00:09:56.92
seriously.

187
00:09:56.92 --> 00:10:02.20
And one of the things that the military culture would bring out is that you have to be

188
00:10:02.20 --> 00:10:04.000
able to overcome the little stuff.

189
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.44
Someone clapping to loud two courts over that can just ruin your life if you're playing

190
00:10:09.44 --> 00:10:10.44
tennis.

191
00:10:10.44 --> 00:10:13.32
You know, like be quiet, be quiet.

192
00:10:13.32 --> 00:10:14.96
It's ridiculous.

193
00:10:14.96 --> 00:10:18.72
And you know, you have to learn how to fight through that kind of adversity.

194
00:10:18.72 --> 00:10:19.72
Yeah.

195
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:25.000
The other thing about tennis, like in jujitsu, if you make generally, if you make a little

196
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.48
mistake, you can kind of recover from it.

197
00:10:27.48 --> 00:10:30.60
You can make adaptations and usually one mistake.

198
00:10:30.60 --> 00:10:32.76
Now look, you can make a mistake in jujitsu and that's it.

199
00:10:32.76 --> 00:10:34.32
You can get armed locked or you can get choked.

200
00:10:34.32 --> 00:10:35.32
It happens.

201
00:10:35.32 --> 00:10:40.36
But you can also make a mistake and you can recover from it and it's not and it will

202
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:41.56
have not a big factor.

203
00:10:41.56 --> 00:10:44.28
But you can you can hit a ball into the net.

204
00:10:44.28 --> 00:10:45.28
That's it.

205
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:46.28
You just lost that point.

206
00:10:46.28 --> 00:10:49.72
Yeah, the point, but not the not the game, not the set, not the match.

207
00:10:49.72 --> 00:10:55.12
You can, I mean, you can come back from huge deficits in tennis.

208
00:10:55.12 --> 00:10:57.64
And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's really like everything else.

209
00:10:57.64 --> 00:10:59.40
It's, it's, it's mental.

210
00:10:59.40 --> 00:11:01.68
So, so you played tennis in college?

211
00:11:01.68 --> 00:11:02.68
I did.

212
00:11:02.68 --> 00:11:04.64
I went to Emory in, in Atlanta.

213
00:11:04.64 --> 00:11:08.76
And then were you thinking that you could be some kind of a pro tennis player?

214
00:11:08.76 --> 00:11:09.76
Absolutely not.

215
00:11:09.76 --> 00:11:14.68
I was just, I mean, so I love the team element of tennis.

216
00:11:14.68 --> 00:11:19.08
I kind of stopped enjoying the individual part of it.

217
00:11:19.08 --> 00:11:20.84
It's just, it's a lot of travel.

218
00:11:20.84 --> 00:11:28.24
It's a lot of, you know, it's just the process of playing tennis in my youth was, I really

219
00:11:28.24 --> 00:11:29.88
enjoyed the team part of it.

220
00:11:29.88 --> 00:11:34.40
And so that continued through college and I really enjoyed it with my team and in

221
00:11:34.40 --> 00:11:36.08
college, I just, I wasn't good enough.

222
00:11:36.08 --> 00:11:37.88
It just wasn't going to happen.

223
00:11:37.88 --> 00:11:43.40
Now, I did consider, hey, maybe I'll go down to South America and like try to place

224
00:11:43.40 --> 00:11:45.64
in tournaments or something after college.

225
00:11:45.64 --> 00:11:49.80
But I tore my rotator cuff my senior year and couldn't, you know.

226
00:11:49.80 --> 00:11:56.16
So when you're, when you're trying to measure yourself at that juncture in life, are you

227
00:11:56.16 --> 00:12:02.40
looking at, hey, this powerful or you're serving, let's just try and break it into something

228
00:12:02.40 --> 00:12:05.36
that a normal, non-tenous player human can understand.

229
00:12:05.36 --> 00:12:10.60
Let's say you're serve a good serve as 120 miles an hour.

230
00:12:10.60 --> 00:12:11.60
That's a big serve.

231
00:12:11.60 --> 00:12:12.60
Yeah.

232
00:12:12.60 --> 00:12:13.60
Okay.

233
00:12:13.60 --> 00:12:16.32
Or let's say 100 miles an hour is like the minimum to get pro.

234
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:21.36
And you're serving, let's just say I'm not saying you, I'm just saying I'm human serving

235
00:12:21.36 --> 00:12:23.000
90.

236
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.92
And they're trying and they're trying all these different things and they just can't really

237
00:12:25.92 --> 00:12:26.92
make it happen.

238
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:28.96
Does that, is that basically what happens?

239
00:12:28.96 --> 00:12:31.72
I mean, at some point are you saying look, it doesn't matter how much I practice.

240
00:12:31.72 --> 00:12:36.52
I don't have the physical aptitude to be top level.

241
00:12:36.52 --> 00:12:40.24
Yeah, I mean, you get into really, really thin air, you know.

242
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:47.88
And just like in buds or in the training that I went through, there's physical capabilities

243
00:12:47.88 --> 00:12:50.40
that will limit certain people.

244
00:12:50.40 --> 00:12:53.60
But there's also mental stuff that will limit certain people.

245
00:12:53.60 --> 00:12:56.60
And mine were mostly physical.

246
00:12:56.60 --> 00:12:58.76
I just wasn't fast enough on the court.

247
00:12:58.76 --> 00:13:03.56
I wasn't, I mean, you get into really thin air where, I mean, these guys that are great

248
00:13:03.56 --> 00:13:07.12
at tennis and girls that are great at tennis, I mean, they were kind of always really

249
00:13:07.12 --> 00:13:08.12
great.

250
00:13:08.12 --> 00:13:09.12
You know?

251
00:13:09.12 --> 00:13:14.48
But I think that it's important to find something to be a part of a team throughout

252
00:13:14.48 --> 00:13:17.12
your life and to do more of that.

253
00:13:17.12 --> 00:13:19.28
And so for me, it was really just a vessel.

254
00:13:19.28 --> 00:13:21.68
I mean, I don't want to confuse myself even with my mother.

255
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:23.88
My mother was a great athlete.

256
00:13:23.88 --> 00:13:25.96
And when it came to tennis.

257
00:13:25.96 --> 00:13:29.84
And I just didn't get the same degree.

258
00:13:29.84 --> 00:13:32.92
My grandfather was in played basketball growing up, you know.

259
00:13:32.92 --> 00:13:39.88
He was drafted to go play for the, for the lakers, but couldn't afford the bus ticket from

260
00:13:39.88 --> 00:13:42.88
Colorado to California.

261
00:13:42.88 --> 00:13:44.32
And so went and got a job.

262
00:13:44.32 --> 00:13:47.32
I mean, times were very different back then.

263
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:48.52
Can you imagine?

264
00:13:48.52 --> 00:13:49.52
Yeah.

265
00:13:49.52 --> 00:13:50.52
That's crazy.

266
00:13:50.52 --> 00:13:55.08
And so when you go to college, are you, would you go to college for?

267
00:13:55.08 --> 00:13:56.40
What are your other economics?

268
00:13:56.40 --> 00:13:57.40
And what were you thinking?

269
00:13:57.40 --> 00:13:59.000
Your future look like.

270
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Yeah.

271
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.84
So I was thinking, I didn't really know, but I thought I would do something in business

272
00:14:03.84 --> 00:14:10.20
or consulting or I had these, you know, these, it's a really tough state to be in when

273
00:14:10.20 --> 00:14:17.08
you're in your early 20s and you're going to college or you're trying to figure out your

274
00:14:17.08 --> 00:14:19.72
life and you don't know where it's going to go.

275
00:14:19.72 --> 00:14:25.80
Like, though, those are hard years and you look at them from an older vantage point and

276
00:14:25.80 --> 00:14:29.76
you say, you kind of had to go through that and it doesn't make it any easier when you're

277
00:14:29.76 --> 00:14:30.76
going through it though.

278
00:14:30.76 --> 00:14:32.32
And so I just, I really didn't know.

279
00:14:32.32 --> 00:14:35.44
I wanted to do something special.

280
00:14:35.44 --> 00:14:37.64
I wanted to do something more.

281
00:14:37.64 --> 00:14:40.72
And I just had no idea what that would mean.

282
00:14:40.72 --> 00:14:44.92
And so, you know, you just sort of say, oh, maybe I'll go work at Goldman Sachs.

283
00:14:44.92 --> 00:14:46.44
That's a great place to work.

284
00:14:46.44 --> 00:14:49.52
Or I'll go work at McKinsey and be a problem solver.

285
00:14:49.52 --> 00:14:50.92
Something to that effect.

286
00:14:50.92 --> 00:14:54.04
And I just didn't, I didn't know.

287
00:14:54.04 --> 00:14:55.04
I didn't know.

288
00:14:55.04 --> 00:15:00.96
And so, graduated 2001, May and still didn't know.

289
00:15:00.96 --> 00:15:04.88
But you know, a few months after that, it was going to be a very different world.

290
00:15:04.88 --> 00:15:07.52
So did you get a job right after college?

291
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:08.52
I did.

292
00:15:08.52 --> 00:15:12.96
I went and traveled a little bit around Central America for like a month or two and that

293
00:15:12.96 --> 00:15:16.000
type of stuff gets, it gets kind of old.

294
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.28
You don't really find yourself when you go far away, which is sort of amplifies what

295
00:15:21.28 --> 00:15:22.52
you're already thinking.

296
00:15:22.52 --> 00:15:24.32
And I needed to do something.

297
00:15:24.32 --> 00:15:25.32
I needed a mission.

298
00:15:25.32 --> 00:15:27.04
I needed purpose.

299
00:15:27.04 --> 00:15:28.48
And I needed a community.

300
00:15:28.48 --> 00:15:33.36
And did you, I mean, obviously your mom wasn't in the military, your dad, your

301
00:15:33.36 --> 00:15:36.76
grandparents are any military roots that you had in your family?

302
00:15:36.76 --> 00:15:41.08
So my, my grandfather was an artillery officer in Korea.

303
00:15:41.08 --> 00:15:43.04
Never talked about it.

304
00:15:43.04 --> 00:15:44.04
Ever.

305
00:15:44.04 --> 00:15:45.04
Right?

306
00:15:45.04 --> 00:15:48.12
Uncle was a naval aviator.

307
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:53.48
He was a class of 77, anapolis grad, but never really saw him.

308
00:15:53.48 --> 00:15:58.48
So it wasn't part of my, the decision-making process of my life.

309
00:15:58.48 --> 00:15:59.84
This is what I can go do.

310
00:15:59.84 --> 00:16:02.48
It was just, it was a bridge too far.

311
00:16:02.48 --> 00:16:07.52
I didn't understand what the military did, frankly.

312
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:12.08
I mean, yeah, defend America, but how, what does that mean for a life?

313
00:16:12.08 --> 00:16:13.08
Right?

314
00:16:13.08 --> 00:16:14.52
I mean, when I grew up, it was peacetime.

315
00:16:14.52 --> 00:16:19.76
I mean, it was, I mean, a side of what year did you graduate high school?

316
00:16:19.76 --> 00:16:20.76
97.

317
00:16:20.76 --> 00:16:21.76
Sure.

318
00:16:21.76 --> 00:16:22.76
Right?

319
00:16:22.76 --> 00:16:27.92
So, I mean, this is not a time when the military is front and center as it is now.

320
00:16:27.92 --> 00:16:32.84
And in fact, if anything, what was the military's purpose at that time?

321
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:37.84
It didn't have a ton of, what wars being fought?

322
00:16:37.84 --> 00:16:40.76
I basically, what I'm saying is, I didn't get it.

323
00:16:40.76 --> 00:16:42.16
It was naive.

324
00:16:42.16 --> 00:16:43.44
But I didn't get it.

325
00:16:43.44 --> 00:16:48.68
And it seems like it was just kind of outside your purview of the world, right?

326
00:16:48.68 --> 00:16:49.92
I mean, it wasn't on the news every day.

327
00:16:49.92 --> 00:16:53.40
You weren't seeing military operations on the news every day like you'd see now.

328
00:16:53.40 --> 00:16:58.76
So it just, you're growing up and it wasn't a thing that was really part of your world.

329
00:16:58.76 --> 00:17:00.88
Look, there was no John F. Kennedy at the time.

330
00:17:00.88 --> 00:17:03.12
You know, ask not what your country can do for you.

331
00:17:03.12 --> 00:17:04.92
Ask what you can do for your country.

332
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:08.40
That wasn't part of the discussion in our country.

333
00:17:08.40 --> 00:17:10.12
And I think that's a problem.

334
00:17:10.12 --> 00:17:12.80
And that should always be a part of the discussion.

335
00:17:12.80 --> 00:17:15.04
That just wasn't the landscape where we are.

336
00:17:15.04 --> 00:17:17.36
So, or where we were.

337
00:17:17.36 --> 00:17:22.16
So it took 9-11 to really bring that to the forefront.

338
00:17:22.16 --> 00:17:23.56
So wait a second, South America.

339
00:17:23.56 --> 00:17:24.56
Do you go solo down there?

340
00:17:24.56 --> 00:17:25.56
Who'd you go?

341
00:17:25.56 --> 00:17:26.56
I went with a buddy.

342
00:17:26.56 --> 00:17:29.40
We just sort of back back, quote, quote, around.

343
00:17:29.40 --> 00:17:32.84
And you're thinking you're going to see the light and find your future?

344
00:17:32.84 --> 00:17:33.84
But we know.

345
00:17:33.84 --> 00:17:40.000
I'm going to just find this magical adventure like D'Caprio did in the beach or whatever.

346
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.92
And it's going to be life-changing.

347
00:17:41.92 --> 00:17:42.92
Whatever.

348
00:17:42.92 --> 00:17:46.56
You know, all who wander or not lost.

349
00:17:46.56 --> 00:17:50.04
Yeah, that's true, but some that wander are lost.

350
00:17:50.04 --> 00:17:52.28
And you know, part of it is you want to have an adventure.

351
00:17:52.28 --> 00:17:53.80
You don't know exactly how to do it.

352
00:17:53.80 --> 00:17:55.32
But you've got to do something.

353
00:17:55.32 --> 00:17:58.000
You can't just sit around and do nothing.

354
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.64
So did you come to any conclusions on your backpack?

355
00:18:01.64 --> 00:18:02.64
I did.

356
00:18:02.64 --> 00:18:04.20
I needed a mission.

357
00:18:04.20 --> 00:18:05.20
I needed to do something.

358
00:18:05.20 --> 00:18:06.20
I just figured that out.

359
00:18:06.20 --> 00:18:10.60
You were like, I just, it was awesome, but so boring.

360
00:18:10.60 --> 00:18:14.80
I just, I needed to be part of something bigger than myself.

361
00:18:14.80 --> 00:18:17.20
You can't backpack around the world for the rest of your life.

362
00:18:17.20 --> 00:18:19.000
You just can't do it.

363
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.16
It's, it's easy to sort of glamorize.

364
00:18:21.16 --> 00:18:24.32
And you know, but it's, it gets old.

365
00:18:24.32 --> 00:18:25.48
Yeah.

366
00:18:25.48 --> 00:18:27.08
Too much freedom.

367
00:18:27.08 --> 00:18:28.08
Too much freedom.

368
00:18:28.08 --> 00:18:29.08
Too much freedom.

369
00:18:29.08 --> 00:18:31.48
There's a lot of time in the day.

370
00:18:31.48 --> 00:18:35.92
And we, we oftentimes think, oh man, this happens so fast.

371
00:18:35.92 --> 00:18:38.92
And, you know, today's gone tomorrow's gone.

372
00:18:38.92 --> 00:18:40.08
I don't have time for anything.

373
00:18:40.08 --> 00:18:41.68
You have a lot of time.

374
00:18:41.68 --> 00:18:45.04
It's just how you prioritize it.

375
00:18:45.04 --> 00:18:49.08
So you, sort of, when you came back from that trip, did you actually get a job somewhere?

376
00:18:49.08 --> 00:18:50.08
I did.

377
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:51.08
And where was that?

378
00:18:51.08 --> 00:18:55.64
So I was working at a call center in Daytona Beach and was doing kind of research

379
00:18:55.64 --> 00:19:00.04
around card dealerships and who we could call and target for stuff.

380
00:19:00.04 --> 00:19:02.68
Like, you're sensing my enthusiasm.

381
00:19:02.68 --> 00:19:05.92
But at the same time, I was grateful to have a job.

382
00:19:05.92 --> 00:19:07.16
And I needed a job.

383
00:19:07.16 --> 00:19:10.36
And so that, so were you hammering the phone lines?

384
00:19:10.36 --> 00:19:11.36
I was.

385
00:19:11.36 --> 00:19:13.32
So you started off as a nugget.

386
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:18.52
Okay, call these call these numbers, ask these people what kind of interior they'd

387
00:19:18.52 --> 00:19:20.08
like in their vehicles or whatever.

388
00:19:20.08 --> 00:19:21.88
It was actually directed to the dealerships.

389
00:19:21.88 --> 00:19:27.52
So I was trying to figure out, you know, I am barely remember.

390
00:19:27.52 --> 00:19:33.80
Trying to get more dealers onto this marketing campaign that the company was running.

391
00:19:33.80 --> 00:19:37.96
And it's actually Vaquus thinking here, I am.

392
00:19:37.96 --> 00:19:39.22
I found it.

393
00:19:39.22 --> 00:19:44.10
I had very much not arrived.

394
00:19:44.10 --> 00:19:45.38
You had that job.

395
00:19:45.38 --> 00:19:48.56
Is that when you had that job is when September the leavened happen?

396
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:49.56
Correct.

397
00:19:49.56 --> 00:19:52.56
And what was your, what was your thought pattern?

398
00:19:52.56 --> 00:19:55.46
Once September, once you saw the towers get hit.

399
00:19:55.46 --> 00:20:02.36
So if you remember, JFK Jr had died in a session, a plane I think was a

400
00:20:02.36 --> 00:20:05.86
that he was piloting and it went down.

401
00:20:05.86 --> 00:20:07.70
And like off the coast along Island.

402
00:20:07.70 --> 00:20:09.000
Something like that, right?

403
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.10
And so that was kind of the initial reaction.

404
00:20:13.10 --> 00:20:15.000
And I think there was just general confusion.

405
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.28
And I woke up, I was getting ready to go to work with my button down

406
00:20:19.28 --> 00:20:23.36
and my cackies and stuff, eating my cereal.

407
00:20:23.36 --> 00:20:25.000
And I had the news on.

408
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.36
And so I remember watching stuff go down.

409
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:31.20
And it just there was just general confusion.

410
00:20:31.20 --> 00:20:33.08
And so I was confused as well.

411
00:20:33.08 --> 00:20:35.60
Like, oh, this is an accident.

412
00:20:35.60 --> 00:20:38.64
And then you just sort of watch it escalate.

413
00:20:38.64 --> 00:20:41.80
And it was obviously very clear that it wasn't an accident.

414
00:20:41.80 --> 00:20:42.64
Yeah.

415
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:45.92
For me, first plane hits, which I think I heard on the radio.

416
00:20:45.92 --> 00:20:50.12
So even when I hear a plane hit the, you know, one of the twin towers, I'm like, oh,

417
00:20:50.12 --> 00:20:53.32
Sessna, you know, pilot doesn't know what he's doing.

418
00:20:53.32 --> 00:20:54.72
It was probably foggy.

419
00:20:54.72 --> 00:20:55.72
Whatever.

420
00:20:55.72 --> 00:20:56.72
He's taking a joy rod.

421
00:20:56.72 --> 00:20:57.72
That's horrible.

422
00:20:57.72 --> 00:21:01.08
And then I saw the images like somewhere, you know,

423
00:21:01.08 --> 00:21:03.32
saw the images on TV or something.

424
00:21:03.32 --> 00:21:06.44
And of the first building of the first tower getting hit.

425
00:21:06.44 --> 00:21:08.16
And I thought, oh, wow.

426
00:21:08.16 --> 00:21:09.72
How does that happen?

427
00:21:09.72 --> 00:21:12.92
As soon as I saw the second, you see that plane come in.

428
00:21:12.92 --> 00:21:13.44
Yeah.

429
00:21:13.44 --> 00:21:15.24
As soon as I saw the second one hit, I was like, oh,

430
00:21:15.24 --> 00:21:16.24
where are those?

431
00:21:16.24 --> 00:21:17.72
That was this is preplanteras of time.

432
00:21:17.72 --> 00:21:21.56
And I just got goosebumps thinking about how much rage I felt

433
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:24.36
at that moment in time.

434
00:21:24.36 --> 00:21:27.20
So how long did it take you to say to yourself,

435
00:21:27.20 --> 00:21:29.40
you're going to go in the military?

436
00:21:29.40 --> 00:21:29.84
Right.

437
00:21:29.84 --> 00:21:33.60
So the initial reaction was, I got it.

438
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:35.08
This is my mission.

439
00:21:35.08 --> 00:21:37.08
I got to figure out how to serve America,

440
00:21:37.08 --> 00:21:39.48
something greater than myself.

441
00:21:39.48 --> 00:21:43.64
The more practical side was joining the military

442
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:46.52
in a time of war was scary.

443
00:21:46.52 --> 00:21:50.36
There was fear, human fear that was running through my veins

444
00:21:50.36 --> 00:21:54.84
about this is, that's a real decision.

445
00:21:54.84 --> 00:21:56.88
And the other part of it was, you know,

446
00:21:56.88 --> 00:22:00.04
the first death was Mike Span.

447
00:22:00.04 --> 00:22:04.44
So Mike Span was in work for the CIA.

448
00:22:04.44 --> 00:22:06.84
And you know, before that was a Marine,

449
00:22:06.84 --> 00:22:09.32
they sort of glossed over that in the telling of it.

450
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:11.68
You know, he was work for the CIA

451
00:22:11.68 --> 00:22:14.44
and he was in Afghanistan, one of the first in.

452
00:22:14.44 --> 00:22:17.08
And so I took a lot of inspiration from that

453
00:22:17.08 --> 00:22:19.84
and sent my packet in to the CIA

454
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:21.96
and a couple other of the alphabet suit agencies

455
00:22:21.96 --> 00:22:24.92
that were generally speaking in the DC area.

456
00:22:24.92 --> 00:22:27.36
And that's a really long process.

457
00:22:27.36 --> 00:22:30.92
So you know, went through that entire process

458
00:22:30.92 --> 00:22:34.12
and met some good people along the way,

459
00:22:34.12 --> 00:22:37.48
met some of the hiring folks at the agency.

460
00:22:37.48 --> 00:22:41.28
And I kept asking about, I didn't know anything, okay.

461
00:22:41.28 --> 00:22:43.28
I heard about, you know, sog.

462
00:22:43.28 --> 00:22:45.88
Like the, it's called Ground Branch.

463
00:22:45.88 --> 00:22:49.72
Right. That's the paramilitary branch of the CIA.

464
00:22:49.72 --> 00:22:51.84
That's where I wanted to be.

465
00:22:51.84 --> 00:22:55.28
And so I didn't know how to get there.

466
00:22:55.28 --> 00:22:56.84
And finally, you know, you make it through

467
00:22:56.84 --> 00:22:59.28
Round after Round after Round of interviews

468
00:22:59.28 --> 00:23:01.92
with the agency and they get more sort of specific

469
00:23:01.92 --> 00:23:03.92
and you have one on one time with interviewers

470
00:23:03.92 --> 00:23:07.48
and you're encouraged to ask questions, which you should.

471
00:23:07.48 --> 00:23:11.64
I'm like, hey, so how do I get to do that kind of stuff?

472
00:23:11.64 --> 00:23:14.44
Like the mission that Mike Span got, how do I do that?

473
00:23:14.44 --> 00:23:17.16
And there was this guy and we were in, you know,

474
00:23:17.16 --> 00:23:22.16
some office space, very, as you might expect,

475
00:23:23.04 --> 00:23:26.24
sterile looking office space in Northern Virginia.

476
00:23:26.24 --> 00:23:30.68
And this guy sitting at a desk, not too dissimilar

477
00:23:30.68 --> 00:23:32.28
to how we're sitting right now, looked right up

478
00:23:32.28 --> 00:23:36.20
and he's like, look, we don't train our guys

479
00:23:36.20 --> 00:23:37.04
in the military.

480
00:23:37.04 --> 00:23:39.24
We take from the special operations branches

481
00:23:39.24 --> 00:23:41.48
and then they come and work for us.

482
00:23:41.48 --> 00:23:44.04
And I had this moment in my head, I'm like, dammit.

483
00:23:44.04 --> 00:23:47.04
And why didn't you tell me this like a year ago, right?

484
00:23:47.04 --> 00:23:50.44
And so that's when it clicked for me.

485
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:53.000
And so now I'm resetting the clock though

486
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.32
because I start going through military application

487
00:23:56.32 --> 00:23:58.92
processes at that time and that's, you know,

488
00:23:58.92 --> 00:24:01.56
2008, 2002.

489
00:24:01.56 --> 00:24:06.08
And there's this perception out there was this perception.

490
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:08.84
I think there's a lot of us who are working really hard

491
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:11.64
to dispel it that you either go to war or you go to jail.

492
00:24:11.64 --> 00:24:15.16
The military has a last option, resort of,

493
00:24:15.16 --> 00:24:16.64
you can't get a job somewhere else.

494
00:24:16.64 --> 00:24:18.04
So you should go join the military.

495
00:24:18.04 --> 00:24:20.28
And that's just patently false.

496
00:24:20.28 --> 00:24:23.84
And so, you know, it was one of those things

497
00:24:23.84 --> 00:24:28.68
where a lot of people wanted to join the military.

498
00:24:28.68 --> 00:24:31.64
A lot of people with really, really stellar resumes

499
00:24:31.64 --> 00:24:34.56
in the aftermath of 9-11, we had a nation of people

500
00:24:34.56 --> 00:24:38.84
who said, send me, I want to go to war to fight for my country.

501
00:24:38.84 --> 00:24:40.92
Now, that's great for the country.

502
00:24:40.92 --> 00:24:42.88
It's hard if you want to go join the military.

503
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:45.16
So, you know, I just graduated from college

504
00:24:45.16 --> 00:24:47.12
of course I'm going to become an officer.

505
00:24:47.12 --> 00:24:48.44
And of course, I don't tell anyone

506
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.36
in my family anything that's going on, right?

507
00:24:50.36 --> 00:24:52.32
So my hair was grown out.

508
00:24:52.32 --> 00:24:56.36
I was working out a lot to sort of do the kind of physical training

509
00:24:56.36 --> 00:24:58.56
or physical fitness that I thought I needed to do

510
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:03.04
in order to join the military and be of some value to someone

511
00:25:03.04 --> 00:25:06.44
in some God forsaken place down range.

512
00:25:06.44 --> 00:25:10.16
And so they thought I was just going off the defense.

513
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:12.56
I just graduated from this expensive college.

514
00:25:12.56 --> 00:25:16.96
I sort of didn't really have direction or purpose.

515
00:25:16.96 --> 00:25:20.72
What was that work in the call center this whole time?

516
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:23.96
No, so I actually moved up to be closer to DC.

517
00:25:23.96 --> 00:25:26.88
I wanted to be closer to where I thought the action was.

518
00:25:26.88 --> 00:25:31.000
And by action, I met where service was happening.

519
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.36
And to me, that was New York and DC.

520
00:25:34.36 --> 00:25:35.52
And so I moved up to DC.

521
00:25:35.52 --> 00:25:37.12
I had some family up there.

522
00:25:37.12 --> 00:25:40.20
I worked as an analyst at a bank then, right?

523
00:25:40.20 --> 00:25:44.28
Which is a great way to work 100 hours a week by Wednesday, right?

524
00:25:44.28 --> 00:25:48.96
And sleep on the floor, you know, for a couple hours before your

525
00:25:48.96 --> 00:25:54.12
boss is all 18 of them come in the next morning with more stuff for you to do.

526
00:25:54.12 --> 00:25:57.96
And so I was up in DC for that period.

527
00:25:57.96 --> 00:26:01.08
Because the interview processes were long and drawn out.

528
00:26:01.08 --> 00:26:03.96
And I didn't know where I wanted to go, but all those places were in DC.

529
00:26:03.96 --> 00:26:08.28
So it was like going through those processes there was a little bit easier.

530
00:26:08.28 --> 00:26:10.84
And also the military process.

531
00:26:10.84 --> 00:26:14.76
So my first place that I applied was to become a Marine Corps officer.

532
00:26:14.76 --> 00:26:22.92
And that just kept going through, hey, you've been selected to go to basic officer

533
00:26:22.92 --> 00:26:23.92
candidates.

534
00:26:23.92 --> 00:26:25.92
Officer, the officer, right?

535
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:28.72
And that just kept not happening.

536
00:26:28.72 --> 00:26:32.80
And eventually, I was like, man, the wars are just passing me by.

537
00:26:32.80 --> 00:26:34.04
It's time.

538
00:26:34.04 --> 00:26:37.88
So do what you got to do, but you need to do it now, or you will regret this for the

539
00:26:37.88 --> 00:26:39.36
rest of your life.

540
00:26:39.36 --> 00:26:45.72
So I went down and then I started talking to a win, was going to go to the Navy

541
00:26:45.72 --> 00:26:50.68
Recruiting Center, which I did and asked about becoming an officer in the Navy and

542
00:26:50.68 --> 00:26:51.68
how do I become a seal?

543
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:54.64
And they're like, well, that takes forever, right?

544
00:26:54.64 --> 00:26:58.72
And I'm like, well, I don't have forever because I want to go fight a war.

545
00:26:58.72 --> 00:27:02.12
So what next door to the Army recruiter?

546
00:27:02.12 --> 00:27:04.000
And he said the same thing, right?

547
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.48
He's like, this takes forever, right?

548
00:27:06.48 --> 00:27:11.24
If you want to go be in special forces, that's you can do that when you're a captain,

549
00:27:11.24 --> 00:27:15.20
promotable or O3, promotable or sorry, O2, promotable about to be a captain.

550
00:27:15.20 --> 00:27:17.72
I think was the time frame on that.

551
00:27:17.72 --> 00:27:19.76
So that's years away.

552
00:27:19.76 --> 00:27:24.28
Now the idea of going and joining an infantry unit or something, it didn't appeal to

553
00:27:24.28 --> 00:27:25.28
me.

554
00:27:25.28 --> 00:27:29.68
I wanted to be, and you have these grandiose notions of what you're capable of.

555
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:34.04
And I wanted to be the guy in the mountains hunting bin Laden.

556
00:27:34.04 --> 00:27:36.08
That's what I wanted to do with my life.

557
00:27:36.08 --> 00:27:41.56
And so the guy sends this, you know, these recruiters, they know when they've got something.

558
00:27:41.56 --> 00:27:44.60
He's like, well, we've got this special program, right?

559
00:27:44.60 --> 00:27:48.20
You can go straight off the street and join special forces.

560
00:27:48.20 --> 00:27:49.20
It's in enlistment.

561
00:27:49.20 --> 00:27:55.04
I'm like, oh, that kind of sounded like a bad word to me.

562
00:27:55.04 --> 00:27:56.24
In enlist, right?

563
00:27:56.24 --> 00:28:01.16
I mean, college degree, you have all these senses of what you're entitled to or what

564
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:03.28
you should be doing with your life.

565
00:28:03.28 --> 00:28:07.40
And part of those are pressures that you're felt from outside forces.

566
00:28:07.40 --> 00:28:12.28
And there's no doubt expectations that family and loved ones, they have for what your life

567
00:28:12.28 --> 00:28:16.24
should be, you know, the perfect life like Edward Norton in Fight Club, right?

568
00:28:16.24 --> 00:28:20.44
Assigning value to the furniture in your house and what apartment you have.

569
00:28:20.44 --> 00:28:25.32
And all these things that really don't matter, but you think about what you should do in

570
00:28:25.32 --> 00:28:27.80
life in order to be happy.

571
00:28:27.80 --> 00:28:34.60
In listing to go be a ground pounder in the army was a little bit removed from what I

572
00:28:34.60 --> 00:28:37.52
thought my direction should be.

573
00:28:37.52 --> 00:28:39.88
And yet that was my choice.

574
00:28:39.88 --> 00:28:45.56
It was do this or sit around and wait forever until they call and say, okay, now you're

575
00:28:45.56 --> 00:28:49.24
validated and can go to become an officer.

576
00:28:49.24 --> 00:28:53.76
And I didn't know anything about this process.

577
00:28:53.76 --> 00:28:58.84
I didn't have anybody that I talked to about what people did in these jobs.

578
00:28:58.84 --> 00:29:00.76
Did you know any SF guys at all?

579
00:29:00.76 --> 00:29:02.56
No, and the two-

580
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:02.56
Oh, the two-

581
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:03.76
Oh, the Marine Corps officers.

582
00:29:03.76 --> 00:29:04.76
No, no.

583
00:29:04.76 --> 00:29:07.76
No, and so it's like, what you see in the movie.

584
00:29:07.76 --> 00:29:09.76
The one you see in the movie.

585
00:29:09.76 --> 00:29:18.40
So the irony is that my next door neighbor that I lived next to in Florida growing up

586
00:29:18.40 --> 00:29:25.92
for, you know, since 92 was an officer, a special forces officer in the army.

587
00:29:25.92 --> 00:29:32.08
And it took until my mom found out because I told her that I didn't list it, which

588
00:29:32.08 --> 00:29:36.000
just jumped to the end a little bit here.

589
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.24
I ended up signing a five-year contract in listing into the army where they guarantee

590
00:29:41.24 --> 00:29:42.92
that you can go to the schools.

591
00:29:42.92 --> 00:29:45.16
They of course don't guarantee that you'll pass.

592
00:29:45.16 --> 00:29:47.72
And it's 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, so extra.

593
00:29:47.72 --> 00:29:54.000
Just basically means that 18 series is the MOS and the X-rays, the designator for we don't

594
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.24
know what your job specifically within the special forces will be.

595
00:29:59.24 --> 00:30:01.64
If you pass, it will assign it to you later.

596
00:30:01.64 --> 00:30:04.96
This is one of those questions I get asked all the time by people, which is, you know,

597
00:30:04.96 --> 00:30:06.24
should I go off a search?

598
00:30:06.24 --> 00:30:07.64
Should I go and list it?

599
00:30:07.64 --> 00:30:10.80
You know, this is just really common for people to ask.

600
00:30:10.80 --> 00:30:14.84
And, you know, I was really lucky because I wouldn't change this.

601
00:30:14.84 --> 00:30:18.16
I am listed and I wouldn't change anything about my career.

602
00:30:18.16 --> 00:30:24.24
My career was ridiculously awesome and super lucky.

603
00:30:24.24 --> 00:30:26.52
And people ask me that question all the time.

604
00:30:26.52 --> 00:30:32.72
It's really hard to get a seal officer billet, like as you join the Navy.

605
00:30:32.72 --> 00:30:38.28
I think there's about 30 a year and there's thousands of people that apply for it.

606
00:30:38.28 --> 00:30:40.76
Like the Naval Academy takes 15.

607
00:30:40.76 --> 00:30:47.88
I think it's 15 from the Naval Academy and then 15 from ROTC and OCS combined.

608
00:30:47.88 --> 00:30:50.48
So this is a tiny number.

609
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:55.76
And so I always tell people, look, you can apply for that, but if you want to be a seal,

610
00:30:55.76 --> 00:30:57.76
do you manned up just having to enlist?

611
00:30:57.76 --> 00:31:03.48
And the same token is, I'm so glad I didn't want to go to college.

612
00:31:03.48 --> 00:31:05.40
Like I wanted to, the same as you.

613
00:31:05.40 --> 00:31:07.84
I mean, there was no war going on, but I wasn't smart enough to figure that out.

614
00:31:07.84 --> 00:31:13.28
And I thought that there was seals all over the globe conducting covert operations.

615
00:31:13.28 --> 00:31:16.12
And I was going to go get some of that exactly.

616
00:31:16.12 --> 00:31:19.40
But you know, so I was like ready to do enlist and I wouldn't do it any other way.

617
00:31:19.40 --> 00:31:22.44
And I ended up going to college when I was like 28 years old.

618
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:25.60
And by then I was like, okay, I can sit in the classroom now.

619
00:31:25.60 --> 00:31:29.28
When I was 18, 19, 20, I didn't want to sit in the classroom.

620
00:31:29.28 --> 00:31:32.56
I wanted a machine gun, you know, like a normal kid.

621
00:31:32.56 --> 00:31:33.56
So yeah.

622
00:31:33.56 --> 00:31:41.48
So I think for people that are on that fence for anybody that knows me or it listens to me at all.

623
00:31:41.48 --> 00:31:48.92
I mean, all day long, I'll tell you that being a infantry soldier,

624
00:31:48.92 --> 00:31:52.36
being an infantry Marine, I mean those are being a machine gunner in the Marine Corps.

625
00:31:52.36 --> 00:31:55.36
I mean, any of those jobs are awesome.

626
00:31:55.36 --> 00:31:58.76
And they'll lead to real leadership in listed leadership positions.

627
00:31:58.76 --> 00:32:01.88
And it's a great experience and a great jobs.

628
00:32:01.88 --> 00:32:04.04
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

629
00:32:04.04 --> 00:32:10.68
I mean, and then on the officer side is like, well, you know, you're going to, if you go in as an

630
00:32:10.68 --> 00:32:14.20
officer, you're going to obviously be put in charge earlier.

631
00:32:14.20 --> 00:32:17.84
You'll end up with more leadership situations sooner.

632
00:32:17.84 --> 00:32:19.88
So there's there's benefits to it.

633
00:32:19.88 --> 00:32:23.76
But at the end of the day, I think what happened to you is what happens to a lot of people.

634
00:32:23.76 --> 00:32:29.48
It's like the path becomes clear, not because of what you want.

635
00:32:29.48 --> 00:32:31.72
But because of the way the world works.

636
00:32:31.72 --> 00:32:36.36
And so when you know, figure out what your path that path should become clear at some point.

637
00:32:36.36 --> 00:32:38.80
And then you say, okay, cool, that looks like my path.

638
00:32:38.80 --> 00:32:39.80
I'm going to go.

639
00:32:39.80 --> 00:32:43.60
And one thing that I will say is in the seal teams for sure, I'm pretty sure it's this

640
00:32:43.60 --> 00:32:46.12
way in the Army and the Marine Corps.

641
00:32:46.12 --> 00:32:53.72
If you're a good and listed human, and you make an effort to become an officer, it's easier

642
00:32:53.72 --> 00:32:58.52
to become an officer when you're an enlisted person than it is to do it coming from straight

643
00:32:58.52 --> 00:32:59.36
out.

644
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:01.48
That's 100% true in the Army and the Marine Corps.

645
00:33:01.48 --> 00:33:04.16
But in the seal teams, it's absolutely true.

646
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:08.80
It's you know, you will have an easier time getting selected if you are already in the seal

647
00:33:08.80 --> 00:33:10.44
teams for six years.

648
00:33:10.44 --> 00:33:11.76
And now you want to become an officer.

649
00:33:11.76 --> 00:33:12.76
It's a little easier.

650
00:33:12.76 --> 00:33:17.76
But you can't count on it because the program that I did, they took 50 people to become

651
00:33:17.76 --> 00:33:19.08
officers out of the whole Navy.

652
00:33:19.08 --> 00:33:24.08
So out of 250,000 people in the Navy, they took 50.

653
00:33:24.08 --> 00:33:25.80
That's not those aren't great odds.

654
00:33:25.80 --> 00:33:30.60
But I don't know, I think the path, I think what happened to you is what happens to a

655
00:33:30.60 --> 00:33:31.60
lot of people.

656
00:33:31.60 --> 00:33:36.52
And you've got to say, OK, my path has been revealed by circumstances.

657
00:33:36.52 --> 00:33:37.72
And I'm going to go for it.

658
00:33:37.72 --> 00:33:39.60
Yeah, you've got to do something.

659
00:33:39.60 --> 00:33:41.76
I mean, there's lots of other alternatives.

660
00:33:41.76 --> 00:33:44.12
You can do nothing and you can regret it.

661
00:33:44.12 --> 00:33:46.32
And that's a really, that's the worst path of all.

662
00:33:46.32 --> 00:33:49.32
Yeah, well, that's another good point that you bring up.

663
00:33:49.32 --> 00:33:53.72
And this is something else that people ask me, you know, oh, should I do this now or

664
00:33:53.72 --> 00:33:58.36
I got a good job offer, but I really want to be in the military or I want to go to college,

665
00:33:58.36 --> 00:33:59.56
but I went over there.

666
00:33:59.56 --> 00:34:01.28
They have a million, I don't want to call them.

667
00:34:01.28 --> 00:34:04.64
Because you see, they have a million legitimate what they believe to be reasons on

668
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:10.64
why they should postpone or possibly not even go into the military.

669
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:15.04
And from my perspective, all these other opportunities you have in life will be there for

670
00:34:15.04 --> 00:34:17.80
a long time, but the military will not be.

671
00:34:17.80 --> 00:34:21.96
You know, that's a very true, I mean, I've yet to meet the person who served in the military

672
00:34:21.96 --> 00:34:22.96
that regretted it.

673
00:34:22.96 --> 00:34:23.96
Oh, yeah.

674
00:34:23.96 --> 00:34:28.32
Everybody says I learned so much and what you really learn is a perspective on life.

675
00:34:28.32 --> 00:34:32.20
I don't care if you're an officer or you're an enlisted or whatever.

676
00:34:32.20 --> 00:34:38.76
You learn about teamwork and camaraderie, not as posters on a, on a, words on a poster

677
00:34:38.76 --> 00:34:42.36
in a bathroom, but as just what it feels like.

678
00:34:42.36 --> 00:34:46.32
And that becomes your northern star in life.

679
00:34:46.32 --> 00:34:49.48
You want to chase that for the rest of your life.

680
00:34:49.48 --> 00:34:51.12
I want to be a part of a team.

681
00:34:51.12 --> 00:34:57.64
I want to feel that reward of service to, to a higher purpose than just myself.

682
00:34:57.64 --> 00:34:59.72
I want to help other people.

683
00:34:59.72 --> 00:35:03.76
And when you connect those dots, you, you just, you need to go do it.

684
00:35:03.76 --> 00:35:09.24
Now, I, I really, I caution people against thinking, oh, I'm going to enlist so that

685
00:35:09.24 --> 00:35:10.84
I can become an officer.

686
00:35:10.84 --> 00:35:12.68
It's, it's very rare.

687
00:35:12.68 --> 00:35:18.76
And so you sort of say, it's not about the actual mechanics.

688
00:35:18.76 --> 00:35:23.12
It's about service and you, you get to pick your path.

689
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:26.36
And you need to pick your path wisely and you need to do it when you're young.

690
00:35:26.36 --> 00:35:29.08
When you're 20, here's what nobody tells you.

691
00:35:29.08 --> 00:35:31.96
You graduate from college or your 20 years older, whatever.

692
00:35:31.96 --> 00:35:37.12
You're, your basic value in, in the universe is nothing.

693
00:35:37.12 --> 00:35:39.76
You're just, you don't have wisdom or perspective.

694
00:35:39.76 --> 00:35:41.52
You don't know yourself.

695
00:35:41.52 --> 00:35:43.44
And that's the biggest part of this.

696
00:35:43.44 --> 00:35:48.84
You haven't been through enough adversity at a mature enough age.

697
00:35:48.84 --> 00:35:54.80
Even if you've got a horrific childhood, you're not at a mature enough age to know yourself

698
00:35:54.80 --> 00:35:56.56
well enough as you get older.

699
00:35:56.56 --> 00:36:03.04
And so what the military does is it forces you through adversity to learn more about yourself,

700
00:36:03.04 --> 00:36:08.40
to how you'll respond to these kinds of challenges in life.

701
00:36:08.40 --> 00:36:10.24
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

702
00:36:10.24 --> 00:36:13.36
really hard place for for all of us.

703
00:36:13.36 --> 00:36:18.08
And you don't get good at doing hard things by only doing easy things.

704
00:36:18.08 --> 00:36:24.32
So take this job offer and this push whatever that you got and watered up and throw it away

705
00:36:24.32 --> 00:36:28.20
and find some cause that you really believe in to serve.

706
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:31.96
And go, go do that and see what path that leads you to.

707
00:36:31.96 --> 00:36:39.72
Because for me, it's, it's got nothing to do at this point about, oh, well, you know,

708
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:45.32
the specifics of, well, a career or however many years in army and it's got everything to do

709
00:36:45.32 --> 00:36:52.20
about the way of life that I want to lead, that I want others to lead with me, which is

710
00:36:52.20 --> 00:36:57.24
based upon the time that I spent in special forces.

711
00:36:57.24 --> 00:37:04.52
You talked about a five year enlistment, which when I joined the Navy, I signed a six year contract.

712
00:37:04.52 --> 00:37:05.52
God bless you.

713
00:37:05.52 --> 00:37:07.80
You're a crude or a gotten, you, you got some high five.

714
00:37:07.80 --> 00:37:08.80
That was not a boys on that.

715
00:37:08.80 --> 00:37:13.92
Yeah, this, the program that he was called the dive fairer program and it was a six year

716
00:37:13.92 --> 00:37:20.36
enlistment that same thing, it gave you an opportunity to do the screening test to go to

717
00:37:20.36 --> 00:37:21.36
Buds.

718
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:23.36
So this is just completely ridiculous.

719
00:37:23.36 --> 00:37:28.76
But I remember thinking it seemed like a lot of people just couldn't, especially people

720
00:37:28.76 --> 00:37:35.44
like you're saying that were my age, whatever, 18, 19, 20 years old for them, for them.

721
00:37:35.44 --> 00:37:41.20
And a little bit of me was like six years seem like this eternal length of time.

722
00:37:41.20 --> 00:37:43.96
And the reality is, man, six years is a joke.

723
00:37:43.96 --> 00:37:48.80
I mean, six years of my 20 year career went by and I can't barely even remember six years.

724
00:37:48.80 --> 00:37:50.80
So that's another thing that people got to overcome.

725
00:37:50.80 --> 00:37:56.56
They got to overcome the fact that this seems like a huge chunk of your life, but the value

726
00:37:56.56 --> 00:38:02.40
that you're going to get out of it is infinitely worth way more than for the rest of your life.

727
00:38:02.40 --> 00:38:03.52
For the rest of your life, you get the question.

728
00:38:03.52 --> 00:38:06.76
Where else are you going to find this in your 20s?

729
00:38:06.76 --> 00:38:07.76
Where else?

730
00:38:07.76 --> 00:38:08.76
You're not.

731
00:38:08.76 --> 00:38:09.76
You're not.

732
00:38:09.76 --> 00:38:11.80
And it doesn't just have to be the military.

733
00:38:11.80 --> 00:38:16.40
There are a lot of other organizations that you can serve that are American needs.

734
00:38:16.40 --> 00:38:17.52
You can go be a teacher.

735
00:38:17.52 --> 00:38:18.52
You can go.

736
00:38:18.52 --> 00:38:21.08
There's lots of things that you can do.

737
00:38:21.08 --> 00:38:26.28
But ultimately, you need to find something with a mission and purpose that you really believe

738
00:38:26.28 --> 00:38:27.28
in.

739
00:38:27.28 --> 00:38:30.36
And just pour your heart into it.

740
00:38:30.36 --> 00:38:31.96
Work really, really hard.

741
00:38:31.96 --> 00:38:32.96
Learn what that feels like.

742
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:39.96
Yeah, and I think you make a good point of working really hard at something.

743
00:38:39.96 --> 00:38:42.80
Well, working really hard at being a soldier.

744
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:46.88
If that's what you are passionate about is a lot easier than working really hard in a call

745
00:38:46.88 --> 00:38:52.28
center when you don't like it or working really hard as an analyst when it's like,

746
00:38:52.28 --> 00:38:53.68
it's not what you want to do.

747
00:38:53.68 --> 00:38:56.16
And you don't see any greater purpose behind it.

748
00:38:56.16 --> 00:39:00.72
I mean, you give me all day long to teach people about leadership, which is what I do

749
00:39:00.72 --> 00:39:01.72
right now.

750
00:39:01.72 --> 00:39:03.76
I do that and I can't even stop doing it.

751
00:39:03.76 --> 00:39:08.48
I mean, it's like I work with a company and I'm so engaged with them.

752
00:39:08.48 --> 00:39:10.04
It's like awesome.

753
00:39:10.04 --> 00:39:14.08
But then you, if you were to remove me from that and put me into a, you know, staring at

754
00:39:14.08 --> 00:39:21.04
spreadsheets and for a bank, it would be hard for me to, you know, really find the passion

755
00:39:21.04 --> 00:39:22.04
and doing that.

756
00:39:22.04 --> 00:39:24.48
Yeah, and people are built differently as well.

757
00:39:24.48 --> 00:39:28.52
Well, some people are, you know, some people love the idea of going straight to college

758
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:31.04
at 18 and working really hard at college.

759
00:39:31.04 --> 00:39:33.000
And doing really well and they could do that.

760
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.12
And that was me as well.

761
00:39:35.12 --> 00:39:42.08
I was, I was, I was working with a company that made candy.

762
00:39:42.08 --> 00:39:43.08
Candy.

763
00:39:43.08 --> 00:39:44.08
Good candy?

764
00:39:44.08 --> 00:39:48.48
Um, not really like what you think of when you think of a good candy, more like just sort

765
00:39:48.48 --> 00:39:53.08
of the normal, when you go to restaurant and you leave and they have like, men's.

766
00:39:53.08 --> 00:39:54.08
Oh, I see.

767
00:39:54.08 --> 00:39:56.60
And you grab a handful of men's or whatever.

768
00:39:56.60 --> 00:39:57.72
They make that kind of candy.

769
00:39:57.72 --> 00:40:03.64
So this isn't like some gourmet candy that they put on a pedestal and talk about.

770
00:40:03.64 --> 00:40:04.64
No, it's not that.

771
00:40:04.64 --> 00:40:06.56
But anyways, I'm, I'm, I'm some speaking this company.

772
00:40:06.56 --> 00:40:09.44
I'm with them and working with them.

773
00:40:09.44 --> 00:40:14.68
And they were talking about this candy and all their different variants of candy and what

774
00:40:14.68 --> 00:40:17.64
they're going to do strategically and where they need it and prove the market share.

775
00:40:17.64 --> 00:40:19.64
Man, they were into it.

776
00:40:19.64 --> 00:40:20.64
They were into it.

777
00:40:20.64 --> 00:40:25.76
And so that's, that's, they found something and they were into it.

778
00:40:25.76 --> 00:40:27.80
I was like, okay, I was like, this is awesome.

779
00:40:27.80 --> 00:40:30.24
I'm glad that these folks are totally into this.

780
00:40:30.24 --> 00:40:37.64
And so I guess to your point, if you are into, you know, if you're into economics and you

781
00:40:37.64 --> 00:40:41.12
go to a bank and that's what you're into and you love trying to figure out trends and you,

782
00:40:41.12 --> 00:40:42.92
hey, that's awesome.

783
00:40:42.92 --> 00:40:46.72
And, and you should proceed down that path.

784
00:40:46.72 --> 00:40:52.24
But if you're not into it, then maybe you should look for a different path.

785
00:40:52.24 --> 00:40:55.72
So I'll tell one more story about this because it, this is important.

786
00:40:55.72 --> 00:40:57.60
I think, I can't, I can't, I can't understand.

787
00:40:57.60 --> 00:41:00.76
So I'm in the Navy, I'm in the SEAL teams.

788
00:41:00.76 --> 00:41:02.12
I'm on a ship.

789
00:41:02.12 --> 00:41:04.24
We're out in the middle of the ocean.

790
00:41:04.24 --> 00:41:06.24
It's pitch black.

791
00:41:06.24 --> 00:41:07.68
There's massive waves.

792
00:41:07.68 --> 00:41:09.08
It's raining.

793
00:41:09.08 --> 00:41:12.76
And we're getting ready to launch our little zodiac boats.

794
00:41:12.76 --> 00:41:14.92
You know, and you're just, you're just launching into death.

795
00:41:14.92 --> 00:41:18.16
I mean, you're not, you're launching into just complete darkness, right?

796
00:41:18.16 --> 00:41:19.48
And there's huge waves.

797
00:41:19.48 --> 00:41:22.40
And it's on a ship that has a well-deck.

798
00:41:22.40 --> 00:41:27.16
So the ramp is going to go down on this thing and we're just going to have our boats

799
00:41:27.16 --> 00:41:29.44
there and just jump into the ocean.

800
00:41:29.44 --> 00:41:35.48
And there's a, there's a Navy guy, a bocens mate, which means he's like a deck hand guy.

801
00:41:35.48 --> 00:41:40.16
But he runs all the, all the launching of, you know, ships are launching of the little boats

802
00:41:40.16 --> 00:41:41.76
and bringing boats back on.

803
00:41:41.76 --> 00:41:42.92
You know, he runs all that stuff.

804
00:41:42.92 --> 00:41:45.92
It's important job in the Navy, a bocens mate.

805
00:41:45.92 --> 00:41:52.80
So as the ramp's going down, the rains pouring in, the waves are crashing.

806
00:41:52.80 --> 00:41:55.16
And this guy looks at me.

807
00:41:55.16 --> 00:41:59.60
And he says, and you know, it's a hard job being a bocens mate because you're doing

808
00:41:59.60 --> 00:42:06.16
all this kind of work of, you know, bloating vehicles, unloading vehicles, loading boats,

809
00:42:06.16 --> 00:42:10.80
unloading boats, you're in charge of making sure that the equipment is maintained.

810
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:13.44
I mean, it's like a hard job.

811
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:17.32
The boat's everything smashing and crashing and water.

812
00:42:17.32 --> 00:42:24.000
And the guy looks at me and he goes, man, I'm glad I don't have your job.

813
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.44
And I looked back at him and I said, well, you know what, I'm glad I don't have your job.

814
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:29.68
So let's make a deal.

815
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:31.32
You do your job and I'll be mine.

816
00:42:31.32 --> 00:42:32.80
And it was totally, it was awesome.

817
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:33.80
It made sense.

818
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:36.64
And the guy kind of laughed and we smiled and then I launched out of the middle of the ocean

819
00:42:36.64 --> 00:42:41.44
to go out and spend, you know, four hours in a transit to get to the beach to swim across

820
00:42:41.44 --> 00:42:45.44
the beach to get onto the beach to do a three day reconnaissance freezing cold.

821
00:42:45.44 --> 00:42:47.04
Hey, that's what we do.

822
00:42:47.04 --> 00:42:50.000
And that guy was going to, you know, be on that ship.

823
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.68
But that's another thing that just, I was in a perfect place.

824
00:42:53.68 --> 00:42:55.16
I love doing what I was doing.

825
00:42:55.16 --> 00:42:58.60
And he was in a perfect place because he loved doing, you know, he was part of something

826
00:42:58.60 --> 00:43:02.36
that was big and part of something that was bigger to himself, you know, being in the Navy,

827
00:43:02.36 --> 00:43:03.36
it was cool.

828
00:43:03.36 --> 00:43:08.76
But you've got to find, if you can, find something that you really like doing.

829
00:43:08.76 --> 00:43:10.16
And just don't hate your life.

830
00:43:10.16 --> 00:43:11.16
Yes.

831
00:43:11.16 --> 00:43:14.16
We do not recommend hating your life.

832
00:43:14.16 --> 00:43:15.16
Never.

833
00:43:15.16 --> 00:43:16.16
Change.

834
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:21.76
If something goes on for too long and you do not like waking up in the morning, then you've

835
00:43:21.76 --> 00:43:22.76
got to change something.

836
00:43:22.76 --> 00:43:23.76
Yes.

837
00:43:23.76 --> 00:43:27.08
And just to make sure, because I'll get asked this about a million times and I've been

838
00:43:27.08 --> 00:43:33.04
asked it, that doesn't mean you walk into work tomorrow and throw your computer at your

839
00:43:33.04 --> 00:43:37.24
supervisor and tell them, I'm going to do something I love and then you're homeless.

840
00:43:37.24 --> 00:43:38.24
No, don't do that.

841
00:43:38.24 --> 00:43:40.16
What you do is you figure out an exit strategy.

842
00:43:40.16 --> 00:43:45.04
You come up with a plan, you actually think about it, you take a year to save money, you

843
00:43:45.04 --> 00:43:46.40
figure out what you're going to do.

844
00:43:46.40 --> 00:43:47.40
That's what you do.

845
00:43:47.40 --> 00:43:48.72
Two jobs one paycheck.

846
00:43:48.72 --> 00:43:52.40
Sometimes the second job is moonlighting is a passion, a hobby.

847
00:43:52.40 --> 00:43:54.04
Try to turn that into reality.

848
00:43:54.04 --> 00:43:55.04
Work really hard.

849
00:43:55.04 --> 00:43:56.04
Yeah.

850
00:43:56.04 --> 00:43:58.08
There's not shortcuts in this.

851
00:43:58.08 --> 00:44:01.92
It's not, hey, let me, let me fire up a brand new Instagram account and that's my new

852
00:44:01.92 --> 00:44:03.76
passion in life and I'm going to become a millionaire.

853
00:44:03.76 --> 00:44:04.76
It's ridiculous.

854
00:44:04.76 --> 00:44:05.76
Right.

855
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:08.36
Find something that you really love to do.

856
00:44:08.36 --> 00:44:10.08
And two jobs one paycheck.

857
00:44:10.08 --> 00:44:11.08
That's the deal.

858
00:44:11.08 --> 00:44:13.68
Or four jobs one paycheck.

859
00:44:13.68 --> 00:44:15.08
Or more sure.

860
00:44:15.08 --> 00:44:16.48
Ten jobs one do.

861
00:44:16.48 --> 00:44:17.88
We figure it out.

862
00:44:17.88 --> 00:44:23.08
And by the way, traveling the world in hopes of finding yourself is not a good plan.

863
00:44:23.08 --> 00:44:24.68
That's my general experience.

864
00:44:24.68 --> 00:44:26.08
That's my general experience.

865
00:44:26.08 --> 00:44:27.32
Yeah, it's interesting.

866
00:44:27.32 --> 00:44:31.68
You actually found yourself while you're sitting in a being an analyst or sitting there on

867
00:44:31.68 --> 00:44:34.36
a call center, you're like, okay, this much I know.

868
00:44:34.36 --> 00:44:35.84
I don't want to do this.

869
00:44:35.84 --> 00:44:38.64
Yeah, I mean, I kind of knew I didn't want to do that.

870
00:44:38.64 --> 00:44:45.16
I just think there's a lot of people out there that want especially in America where there's

871
00:44:45.16 --> 00:44:50.64
so much opportunity, we can do so many things with our lives here.

872
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:54.24
There's just so much freedom we don't even realize.

873
00:44:54.24 --> 00:44:58.64
And yet we feel enslaved to other people's expectations.

874
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:02.64
And so we start falling into that trap of, well, I got to go do this and I got to

875
00:45:02.64 --> 00:45:04.64
earn this much and I got to chase that.

876
00:45:04.64 --> 00:45:08.60
Did you, did your family, meaning your mom, your grandparents?

877
00:45:08.60 --> 00:45:13.04
Your friends, did they have enough understanding of the military to realize that when

878
00:45:13.04 --> 00:45:18.12
they disappointed when you enlisted, when they like, oh, no, your officer material son,

879
00:45:18.12 --> 00:45:21.04
they were absolutely my mom cried in the kitchen.

880
00:45:21.04 --> 00:45:26.36
She would have cried if she would have cried if I wanted, if I thought I was becoming

881
00:45:26.36 --> 00:45:28.88
an officer either as well.

882
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:34.52
I mean, it was just one of those things where it was a time of war and that's hard

883
00:45:34.52 --> 00:45:36.84
for moms and God bless moms.

884
00:45:36.84 --> 00:45:39.56
I think they have the hardest job on the planet.

885
00:45:39.56 --> 00:45:44.40
And so that was just a really difficult time.

886
00:45:44.40 --> 00:45:52.72
It was October of 2003 that I enlisted and the war and a racket kicked off.

887
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:54.72
I felt like I'd missed it.

888
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:58.04
You see them toppling the statue of Saddam.

889
00:45:58.04 --> 00:46:00.44
I felt like I'd missed it.

890
00:46:00.44 --> 00:46:05.16
And yes, so I came back from the recruiting station and I told my mom in the kitchen,

891
00:46:05.16 --> 00:46:10.40
my brother was sitting on the, my brother's younger and he was sitting on the counter and

892
00:46:10.40 --> 00:46:15.78
I had missed some calls and some stuff and my mom was upset with me and generally my

893
00:46:15.78 --> 00:46:18.60
mom just didn't know what I was doing with my life either, right?

894
00:46:18.60 --> 00:46:21.44
Because she had expectations that I was going to do something important with my life

895
00:46:21.44 --> 00:46:23.96
and I wasn't doing that.

896
00:46:23.96 --> 00:46:30.92
And I told her that I didn't enlisted to go join special forces and she just lost it.

897
00:46:30.92 --> 00:46:34.20
And then there were this sort of, how long was it between your enlistment when you left

898
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:36.44
for boot camp three weeks?

899
00:46:36.44 --> 00:46:37.44
Oh, really.

900
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:42.48
So maybe I'm going to sit around October 1st and I left 28th of October.

901
00:46:42.48 --> 00:46:44.44
Pretty quick, turn, turn, turn.

902
00:46:44.44 --> 00:46:45.44
Yeah.

903
00:46:45.44 --> 00:46:47.80
Okay, so mom's soul is crushed.

904
00:46:47.80 --> 00:46:53.36
Yeah, and then there's the aftermath with the grandparents and my, just the family.

905
00:46:53.36 --> 00:46:58.52
So as we talked about earlier, my mom was really young when she had me and so a lot

906
00:46:58.52 --> 00:47:02.24
of the rest of my family took a very vested interest in me.

907
00:47:02.24 --> 00:47:07.40
And I'm the person that I am, and there's such things a self-made man and I'm a product

908
00:47:07.40 --> 00:47:12.08
of the time and effort that they spent to help raise me.

909
00:47:12.08 --> 00:47:15.92
And including my dad, I've visited, spent tons of time with my dad in Ohio in the summer

910
00:47:15.92 --> 00:47:17.16
and his parents.

911
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:20.60
And I just had a lot of people in my life.

912
00:47:20.60 --> 00:47:24.80
And there was just a lot of questioning about this decision.

913
00:47:24.80 --> 00:47:28.08
Is there anyone that said right on good call?

914
00:47:28.08 --> 00:47:31.68
My dad was actually almost relieved.

915
00:47:31.68 --> 00:47:34.96
He just said, okay, that sounds about right.

916
00:47:34.96 --> 00:47:35.96
Yeah.

917
00:47:35.96 --> 00:47:41.28
But you know, everyone worries that you have to just accept that.

918
00:47:41.28 --> 00:47:47.68
So selfishness is something that gets thrown around as a very negative thing.

919
00:47:47.68 --> 00:47:55.16
And you know, part of what you have to do to make yourself happy is you have to be selfish.

920
00:47:55.16 --> 00:47:57.20
You have to say, and call it whatever you want.

921
00:47:57.20 --> 00:48:02.20
But this makes me happy. I need to do this regardless of the consequences.

922
00:48:02.20 --> 00:48:04.68
And it's not just a soldier that goes to war.

923
00:48:04.68 --> 00:48:07.36
The family is very much a part of that experience.

924
00:48:07.36 --> 00:48:14.000
And I completely shut them out throughout this entire process and then just dropped a bomb

925
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
on them and said, I'm leaving in a month.

926
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.12
I'm going to go to boot camp and then I'm going to war.

927
00:48:21.12 --> 00:48:25.56
And you know, there was a part of me that really felt like that.

928
00:48:25.56 --> 00:48:29.68
I knew I needed to do it. But it's a scary thing.

929
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:32.88
I mean, it's a lot less scary to me now.

930
00:48:32.88 --> 00:48:38.04
I mean, the idea of hey, you've got to go back on the next smoke and bird to Afghanistan or Iraq.

931
00:48:38.04 --> 00:48:39.68
I mean, it's still something.

932
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:44.52
If you're not scared, at least a little bit, if you don't get in adrenaline rush,

933
00:48:44.52 --> 00:48:47.000
if someone's shooting at you, there's a problem.

934
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.32
You know, like if you're not mortally aware of what's going on,

935
00:48:53.32 --> 00:48:56.08
there's probably something not quite right.

936
00:48:56.08 --> 00:49:01.20
And yet at that time, it was just so unknown.

937
00:49:01.20 --> 00:49:06.20
I mean, I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was going to die.

938
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:08.92
And I'm sure my mom did.

939
00:49:08.92 --> 00:49:11.92
All right.

940
00:49:11.92 --> 00:49:14.96
So you show up at boot camp.

941
00:49:14.96 --> 00:49:20.28
How many hours or days was it in the boot camp that you said to yourself,

942
00:49:20.28 --> 00:49:26.92
oh, man, I screwed up. I could not believe how hard boot camp was.

943
00:49:26.92 --> 00:49:29.96
I mean, how miserable it was.

944
00:49:29.96 --> 00:49:33.48
It was, and I was a little older, so I was 24.

945
00:49:33.48 --> 00:49:37.44
And I was like, had a little bit more perspective, maybe.

946
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:43.08
Then some of the guys were 17 and 18, which maybe that wasn't a good thing.

947
00:49:43.08 --> 00:49:47.84
I love the fact that I was really young going through all because

948
00:49:47.84 --> 00:49:50.20
you're just too dumb to figure out.

949
00:49:50.20 --> 00:49:54.24
I mean, I just, I would not want to go through, when I was 24 years old,

950
00:49:54.24 --> 00:49:55.68
I wouldn't have wanted to go through boot camp.

951
00:49:55.68 --> 00:49:57.80
I mean, I would have done it, of course.

952
00:49:57.80 --> 00:50:01.72
But it would have sucked even more, because you understand the world a little bit better.

953
00:50:01.72 --> 00:50:04.04
You've had some kind of a taste of freedom.

954
00:50:04.04 --> 00:50:06.56
And I mean, I just was like, hey, okay, you want me to do this.

955
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:07.28
I'm going to do it.

956
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:11.72
It was like, I was the perfect recruit really in a way.

957
00:50:11.72 --> 00:50:14.32
Because I was just young and dumb.

958
00:50:14.32 --> 00:50:21.000
So I suffered the biggest thing I suffered from was just overthinking stuff.

959
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.48
Because I would sit and why are they doing this?

960
00:50:23.48 --> 00:50:25.60
That's the worst thing you can ask yourself.

961
00:50:25.60 --> 00:50:26.60
Yeah.

962
00:50:26.60 --> 00:50:27.60
Why?

963
00:50:27.60 --> 00:50:28.60
It doesn't matter.

964
00:50:28.60 --> 00:50:30.24
You have to learn how to just do.

965
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:33.56
And so this is one of those things that you need to learn in your 20s.

966
00:50:33.56 --> 00:50:39.72
So what will make a huge impact is who is telling you what to do?

967
00:50:39.72 --> 00:50:42.92
Because if you align yourself with something that you don't believe in with a person

968
00:50:42.92 --> 00:50:47.08
you don't really respect and they're telling you what to do, you're going to adapt your life

969
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:49.44
to their way at that time.

970
00:50:49.44 --> 00:50:58.56
And the military, it's got a very powerful way of creating very strong people.

971
00:50:58.56 --> 00:51:02.28
Wherever you started, you will end up stronger for your time in the military.

972
00:51:02.28 --> 00:51:06.24
And that all begins with this basic, common experience of basic training.

973
00:51:06.24 --> 00:51:12.52
And I just, I couldn't believe how hard it was and how just it was.

974
00:51:12.52 --> 00:51:19.52
It was completely void of all social norms and etiquettes and all of those things.

975
00:51:19.52 --> 00:51:26.32
I mean, nothing was off limits in terms of their ability to denigrate you for any reason

976
00:51:26.32 --> 00:51:27.32
whatsoever.

977
00:51:27.32 --> 00:51:33.48
In Navy Bootcamp, you are an open bay barracks, obviously.

978
00:51:33.48 --> 00:51:36.84
And then the toilets are just on the wall.

979
00:51:36.84 --> 00:51:38.24
There's 20 toilets in a row.

980
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:43.12
Like you're going to sit down on a toilet and they're going to be looking at 19 other

981
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:45.72
people that are also saying there's no privacy whatsoever.

982
00:51:45.72 --> 00:51:46.72
Zero.

983
00:51:46.72 --> 00:51:47.72
It's all gone.

984
00:51:47.72 --> 00:51:49.08
It's just zero.

985
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:52.44
And then the other thing is, because this is people always, you know, they listen to

986
00:51:52.44 --> 00:51:54.28
podcast and they, hey, I just didn't listen to them.

987
00:51:54.28 --> 00:51:56.28
And go ahead, just listen to the army.

988
00:51:56.28 --> 00:51:58.48
They'll send me that message.

989
00:51:58.48 --> 00:52:05.56
And I'm like, okay, 72 hours in the bootcamp, you're going to hate me.

990
00:52:05.56 --> 00:52:10.40
And I'm like, just give it another few more weeks, because the thing that we're not used

991
00:52:10.40 --> 00:52:18.52
to, even as an 18 year old, is you're not used to your freedom being completely gone.

992
00:52:18.52 --> 00:52:21.64
Completely, there's zero freedom when you get to bootcamp, none zero.

993
00:52:21.64 --> 00:52:23.88
You're going to be doing what someone else tells you do.

994
00:52:23.88 --> 00:52:25.08
You have no freedom to do anything.

995
00:52:25.08 --> 00:52:28.36
You can't even go to the bathroom when you want to go to the bathroom.

996
00:52:28.36 --> 00:52:29.36
You throw a sergeant.

997
00:52:29.36 --> 00:52:30.36
Can I go use the loophany?

998
00:52:30.36 --> 00:52:31.36
You have me.

999
00:52:31.36 --> 00:52:33.60
It's no freedom whatsoever.

1000
00:52:33.60 --> 00:52:40.24
And that is, as you said, very important lesson to learn on life.

1001
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:42.000
You learn to appreciate your freedom.

1002
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.12
And you also learn to deal with the fact that, hey, just because I can't control this

1003
00:52:47.12 --> 00:52:51.48
aspect of my life doesn't mean I can't control other aspects of my life.

1004
00:52:51.48 --> 00:52:54.52
And that's an important thing to figure out as a young person.

1005
00:52:54.52 --> 00:52:57.20
And you kind of learn to play the game too, right?

1006
00:52:57.20 --> 00:52:59.68
Like, look, there's no way around this.

1007
00:52:59.68 --> 00:53:04.84
This drill instructor, this instructor is going to do this.

1008
00:53:04.84 --> 00:53:11.04
And the only possible thing I can do, I mean, other than quitting is just a shut up

1009
00:53:11.04 --> 00:53:12.44
and just do what you're supposed to do.

1010
00:53:12.44 --> 00:53:13.92
It's like, okay, cool.

1011
00:53:13.92 --> 00:53:14.92
That's no option.

1012
00:53:14.92 --> 00:53:16.92
It's a great option.

1013
00:53:16.92 --> 00:53:17.92
Do it or quit.

1014
00:53:17.92 --> 00:53:18.92
Do it or quit.

1015
00:53:18.92 --> 00:53:21.000
And you can't quit, bootcamp.

1016
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.28
You can quit, buds or special sports qualification course.

1017
00:53:24.28 --> 00:53:25.28
You can't quit.

1018
00:53:25.28 --> 00:53:27.24
You literally go a wall.

1019
00:53:27.24 --> 00:53:32.24
And then they go find you and one guy went, well, they found him at the gas station,

1020
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:36.84
you know, off base or whatever, trying to get someone to buy him some coffee or something,

1021
00:53:36.84 --> 00:53:38.16
whatever, and they brought him back.

1022
00:53:38.16 --> 00:53:40.68
And then he was back into it.

1023
00:53:40.68 --> 00:53:44.60
Except he was like, I was a bull's eye on him because he's the guy that went a wall.

1024
00:53:44.60 --> 00:53:46.000
And they dragged him back.

1025
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.56
And it's, I can't stress enough what you just said.

1026
00:53:49.56 --> 00:53:51.72
You have zero privacy.

1027
00:53:51.72 --> 00:53:57.20
And this is a culture shock for a lot of people because this is the whole

1028
00:53:57.20 --> 00:53:58.84
everything that we do.

1029
00:53:58.84 --> 00:54:02.52
Our system is based around a culture of eye.

1030
00:54:02.52 --> 00:54:02.72
Right?

1031
00:54:02.72 --> 00:54:07.04
At its basic level now, you have your iPhone, you have your individually wrapped

1032
00:54:07.04 --> 00:54:10.56
everything, you have, you know, me, me, me.

1033
00:54:10.56 --> 00:54:10.76
Right?

1034
00:54:10.76 --> 00:54:15.76
And that's going to make you happy or that's, you know, you, everything is,

1035
00:54:15.76 --> 00:54:18.20
is just centered around the individual.

1036
00:54:18.20 --> 00:54:23.000
And the army just doesn't prescribe to that privacy.

1037
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.84
I mean, there's all these privacy debates now, social media,

1038
00:54:25.84 --> 00:54:28.60
and you're data and all of the privacy.

1039
00:54:28.60 --> 00:54:31.60
As if that's just some right that you have.

1040
00:54:31.60 --> 00:54:34.04
And that's fine, there's some nuance to that.

1041
00:54:34.04 --> 00:54:38.04
Well, let me just tell you, zero percent of that exists in the military.

1042
00:54:38.04 --> 00:54:39.20
Zero.

1043
00:54:39.20 --> 00:54:41.92
Like you said, I mean, there's just a lot of naked dudes, you know,

1044
00:54:41.92 --> 00:54:45.92
it opened the trains and it's just, that's what it is.

1045
00:54:45.92 --> 00:54:49.80
And you learn that that's kind of a primordial way to exist.

1046
00:54:49.80 --> 00:54:55.20
And you are much more in touch with how our species evolved

1047
00:54:55.20 --> 00:55:01.12
over our entire evolution of homo sapiens when you join the military.

1048
00:55:01.12 --> 00:55:03.28
And you just become in tune with that.

1049
00:55:03.28 --> 00:55:03.64
Yeah.

1050
00:55:03.64 --> 00:55:08.60
And I think the most important message that gets relayed into your brain,

1051
00:55:08.60 --> 00:55:12.28
whether you're conscious of it or not, is crystal clear.

1052
00:55:12.28 --> 00:55:18.56
And that is this team and this organization is more important than you are.

1053
00:55:18.56 --> 00:55:22.80
And your little wants and needs and desires and your personality

1054
00:55:22.80 --> 00:55:29.28
doesn't matter when it's compared to the needs of this team and this group and this mission.

1055
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:30.04
And that's important.

1056
00:55:30.04 --> 00:55:34.04
Another very important thing to learn as a young person.

1057
00:55:34.04 --> 00:55:36.48
You're not at the center of the universe.

1058
00:55:36.48 --> 00:55:37.48
Period.

1059
00:55:37.48 --> 00:55:38.96
The end.

1060
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:45.64
And so now as that evolved for me, one of the most important lessons.

1061
00:55:45.64 --> 00:55:49.48
And this is where you have to spend a lifetime mastering it.

1062
00:55:49.48 --> 00:55:55.68
Is to understand that to be a great teammate, first you have to be a great individual.

1063
00:55:55.68 --> 00:55:58.68
And then you have to submit to the team.

1064
00:55:58.68 --> 00:56:02.44
Because anybody on your SEAL teams or my special forces teams,

1065
00:56:02.44 --> 00:56:06.000
they're these are people that can do anything with their lives.

1066
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.04
They commit themselves, they will do it.

1067
00:56:09.04 --> 00:56:13.52
And so you have to become a master of your trade, a true professional.

1068
00:56:13.52 --> 00:56:18.000
And that requires the discipline that you have as an individual

1069
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.48
when nobody's looking over your shoulder to just continually refine and sharpen the blade,

1070
00:56:25.48 --> 00:56:26.68
right your own.

1071
00:56:26.68 --> 00:56:31.20
And then though you have to realize that it's not about you.

1072
00:56:31.20 --> 00:56:35.16
It's a balancing act for an entire lifetime.

1073
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:39.80
And the more that you do both of those in concert,

1074
00:56:39.80 --> 00:56:41.76
the more rewarding life will be.

1075
00:56:41.76 --> 00:56:47.44
Yeah, and really the thing that drives you to be as good as you can

1076
00:56:47.44 --> 00:56:50.24
is because you know your teammates are going to be relying on you.

1077
00:56:50.24 --> 00:56:53.80
And if you can't deliver, that's like the worst thing in the world,

1078
00:56:53.80 --> 00:56:55.08
me being in the SEAL teams.

1079
00:56:55.08 --> 00:57:00.16
Like the worst thing in the world for someone in the teams for a good SEAL is like,

1080
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:04.04
oh, my teammates were counting on me and I couldn't deliver form.

1081
00:57:04.04 --> 00:57:06.24
That's the that's the lowest of the low.

1082
00:57:06.24 --> 00:57:08.24
Hey, look, somebody looks at me and says, oh,

1083
00:57:08.24 --> 00:57:09.44
Jockel is not that faster.

1084
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:11.24
Jockel couldn't do enough pull-ups or whatever.

1085
00:57:11.24 --> 00:57:12.28
It's like, oh, yeah, that's on me.

1086
00:57:12.28 --> 00:57:15.40
No big deal, but when they needed me to climb that ladder,

1087
00:57:15.40 --> 00:57:18.44
they needed me to finish that road marcher,

1088
00:57:18.44 --> 00:57:21.04
moved to that position and I couldn't do it.

1089
00:57:22.76 --> 00:57:28.36
That's what always drives like a good team guy to be better.

1090
00:57:28.36 --> 00:57:30.28
It's like they don't want to let their friends down.

1091
00:57:30.28 --> 00:57:30.88
Period.

1092
00:57:30.88 --> 00:57:32.04
So the ultimate motivation.

1093
00:57:32.04 --> 00:57:32.84
Yeah.

1094
00:57:32.84 --> 00:57:34.52
They to be a part of that community.

1095
00:57:34.52 --> 00:57:37.72
And in the community, sharpens itself.

1096
00:57:37.72 --> 00:57:40.84
I mean, you get guys and competition breeds excellence.

1097
00:57:40.84 --> 00:57:41.52
They're for sure.

1098
00:57:41.52 --> 00:57:44.60
And so you've got this world where as iron sharpens iron,

1099
00:57:44.60 --> 00:57:46.000
so a friend sharpens a friend.

1100
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.68
And that is just every day on the team.

1101
00:57:48.68 --> 00:57:49.76
Everything's a competition.

1102
00:57:49.76 --> 00:57:52.44
Everything's a competition.

1103
00:57:52.44 --> 00:57:55.36
So when you get done with boot camp,

1104
00:57:55.36 --> 00:57:57.80
and then what, you go to AIT?

1105
00:57:57.80 --> 00:58:00.52
Yeah, for me, they kind of were lumped in together

1106
00:58:00.52 --> 00:58:03.48
because it was infantry, boot camp,

1107
00:58:03.48 --> 00:58:05.40
and infantry, AIT, whatever.

1108
00:58:05.40 --> 00:58:08.96
It was just the same entire crew at the same place

1109
00:58:08.96 --> 00:58:13.28
in Fort Benning over the winner in Georgia, which was just,

1110
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:14.76
I mean, it's horrible.

1111
00:58:14.76 --> 00:58:16.20
It's really, really cold.

1112
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:20.32
And they just, they put you in formation at O'Dark 34,

1113
00:58:20.32 --> 00:58:21.16
whatever.

1114
00:58:21.16 --> 00:58:22.000
Stand there.

1115
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.56
You just stand there and shiver.

1116
00:58:23.56 --> 00:58:25.16
I mean, it is just horrific.

1117
00:58:25.16 --> 00:58:28.92
The army beats the, the navy at that,

1118
00:58:28.92 --> 00:58:33.000
as far as just formations and just standing there.

1119
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Because I, the only, the only real,

1120
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.24
I guess the only real army school I ever did,

1121
00:58:38.24 --> 00:58:40.52
that's like sort of a basic army school.

1122
00:58:40.52 --> 00:58:43.24
So I went to Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia,

1123
00:58:43.24 --> 00:58:46.80
and like, hey, we're gonna get a formation,

1124
00:58:46.80 --> 00:58:49.32
and we're gonna stand out here until when,

1125
00:58:49.32 --> 00:58:51.60
until we're done standing out here,

1126
00:58:51.60 --> 00:58:53.92
just standing at a position of attention.

1127
00:58:53.92 --> 00:58:55.76
That's another thing you like,

1128
00:58:55.76 --> 00:58:57.92
the run-and-to-deal with the fact that

1129
00:58:57.92 --> 00:59:00.64
you've not always gonna be in control of what's happening,

1130
00:59:00.64 --> 00:59:01.48
and how you're gonna deal with it,

1131
00:59:01.48 --> 00:59:03.20
you're gonna suck it up and stand there.

1132
00:59:03.20 --> 00:59:04.04
Guess what?

1133
00:59:04.04 --> 00:59:04.88
Stand there.

1134
00:59:04.88 --> 00:59:06.04
So for an silence, yeah.

1135
00:59:06.04 --> 00:59:08.64
You know, this is where all of these phrases come from.

1136
00:59:08.64 --> 00:59:09.48
Yeah.

1137
00:59:09.48 --> 00:59:12.08
But you've got so much creativity,

1138
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:15.04
because from these guys standing in this formation

1139
00:59:15.04 --> 00:59:16.36
with all this available time,

1140
00:59:16.36 --> 00:59:20.04
it's sitting think about how miserable their life is, right?

1141
00:59:20.04 --> 00:59:23.04
And then you say, how do you come up with something sort of cute?

1142
00:59:23.04 --> 00:59:24.24
Oh, suffer in silence.

1143
00:59:24.24 --> 00:59:25.36
You know, just stuff like that.

1144
00:59:25.36 --> 00:59:27.60
And yeah, there's a lot of lines for this.

1145
00:59:27.60 --> 00:59:28.44
There's a lot of lines for this.

1146
00:59:28.44 --> 00:59:31.12
Like the more horrible things that happened to you,

1147
00:59:31.12 --> 00:59:32.72
the more proud you are,

1148
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:35.72
and the more you relish in those old days,

1149
00:59:35.72 --> 00:59:37.44
and that's where pride comes from.

1150
00:59:37.44 --> 00:59:38.52
You know, pride comes from like,

1151
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:42.36
oh, we did really hard things, and they sucked.

1152
00:59:42.36 --> 00:59:43.52
They were proud of them.

1153
00:59:43.52 --> 00:59:44.36
Yes.

1154
00:59:44.36 --> 00:59:46.04
And so the other part is,

1155
00:59:46.04 --> 00:59:48.80
this is how you become a better leader,

1156
00:59:48.80 --> 00:59:50.80
how you become more confident.

1157
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:52.16
It's incremental.

1158
00:59:52.16 --> 00:59:53.76
You don't just wake up one day

1159
00:59:53.76 --> 00:59:56.12
and all of a sudden you're Abraham Lincoln, right?

1160
00:59:56.12 --> 00:59:57.12
It doesn't work that way.

1161
00:59:57.12 --> 00:59:59.32
You can't just sit and read books all day.

1162
00:59:59.32 --> 01:00:02.04
You have to actually take books and apply them

1163
01:00:02.04 --> 01:00:04.16
to harder situations incrementally.

1164
01:00:04.16 --> 01:00:07.56
And what the military taught me that teaches all of us

1165
01:00:07.56 --> 01:00:10.12
is what you're capable of doing,

1166
01:00:10.12 --> 01:00:12.32
and what you're capable of enduring,

1167
01:00:12.32 --> 01:00:14.80
and it pushes your body, and it pushes your mind,

1168
01:00:14.80 --> 01:00:17.12
and miserable horrific ways,

1169
01:00:17.12 --> 01:00:19.24
and you gain confidence from that,

1170
01:00:19.24 --> 01:00:22.44
and you just, you climb one wrong higher on the ladder,

1171
01:00:22.44 --> 01:00:25.000
and then when life gets really, really hard,

1172
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.44
then you can draw upon what you learned

1173
01:00:27.44 --> 01:00:31.28
throughout that process of the last wrong that you climbed.

1174
01:00:31.28 --> 01:00:34.24
Yeah, people, I got asked that recently.

1175
01:00:35.24 --> 01:00:36.12
You know, people are always looking

1176
01:00:36.12 --> 01:00:39.52
for kind of this sound, a good sound by a good clickbait,

1177
01:00:39.52 --> 01:00:42.84
title, for an article, but someone asked me something

1178
01:00:42.84 --> 01:00:45.68
along the lines of, like, what was the moment

1179
01:00:45.68 --> 01:00:49.40
that all this leadership stuff came,

1180
01:00:49.40 --> 01:00:51.44
like, we came clear to you.

1181
01:00:51.44 --> 01:00:53.16
And I was like, there wasn't one moment.

1182
01:00:53.16 --> 01:00:56.64
You know, I learned this stuff, one mistake

1183
01:00:56.64 --> 01:00:58.64
over a little mistake, over a big mistake,

1184
01:00:58.64 --> 01:01:00.40
over a little mistake, over years and years and years

1185
01:01:00.40 --> 01:01:01.40
and years and years and going, okay,

1186
01:01:01.40 --> 01:01:03.52
and even now I'll make a mistake tomorrow.

1187
01:01:03.52 --> 01:01:05.68
I'll do something dumb this afternoon,

1188
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:07.44
and learn something else.

1189
01:01:07.44 --> 01:01:09.40
And that's, you're right, that is what the military does.

1190
01:01:09.40 --> 01:01:13.24
And it is important that when you realize

1191
01:01:13.24 --> 01:01:17.96
something as stupid as, hey, you're gonna stand

1192
01:01:17.96 --> 01:01:23.44
in formation until it stops, and that could be two hours,

1193
01:01:23.44 --> 01:01:26.000
three hours, you don't even know how long it's gonna be.

1194
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.68
And guess what, when you get done with that,

1195
01:01:28.68 --> 01:01:29.80
okay, cool, now we're done with that.

1196
01:01:29.80 --> 01:01:32.32
And now in the next thing you face, you go on, you know what?

1197
01:01:32.32 --> 01:01:34.84
I can get through this.

1198
01:01:34.84 --> 01:01:36.32
I can get through this.

1199
01:01:36.32 --> 01:01:40.40
I can keep my mouth shut, or I can drive forward,

1200
01:01:40.40 --> 01:01:42.64
or I can stand here, or I can stand the push up position,

1201
01:01:42.64 --> 01:01:44.32
or I can stay awake on this patrol,

1202
01:01:44.32 --> 01:01:48.28
or I can sit here and freeze in this cold weather,

1203
01:01:48.28 --> 01:01:50.44
lay up position in the mountains.

1204
01:01:50.44 --> 01:01:53.20
I can get through this, and it will make a difference

1205
01:01:53.20 --> 01:01:54.12
when I'm done.

1206
01:01:54.12 --> 01:01:58.000
So let's just buckle in and get it done.

1207
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.56
So the evolution of that for me was,

1208
01:02:01.56 --> 01:02:05.48
we were the early phases of this special sports qualification course,

1209
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:09.24
the Cadbury line to solve up and not just for formation,

1210
01:02:09.24 --> 01:02:11.56
but he goes, all right, here's the task at hand.

1211
01:02:11.56 --> 01:02:14.44
You're gonna lunge around this building until I get tired.

1212
01:02:14.44 --> 01:02:17.08
And like so, you know, at that point,

1213
01:02:17.08 --> 01:02:19.80
standing in formation didn't sound so bad.

1214
01:02:19.80 --> 01:02:22.04
You know, lunge around the building until I get tired,

1215
01:02:22.04 --> 01:02:23.52
and you're sitting there thinking,

1216
01:02:23.52 --> 01:02:25.08
of course you don't say it, but Cadbury,

1217
01:02:25.08 --> 01:02:25.96
how are you gonna get tired?

1218
01:02:25.96 --> 01:02:27.28
You're not doing the lunge.

1219
01:02:27.28 --> 01:02:28.64
And of course, that's the point.

1220
01:02:28.64 --> 01:02:33.64
And so you just sort of do it until you don't.

1221
01:02:33.64 --> 01:02:37.64
So that's how you kicked off the Q course.

1222
01:02:37.64 --> 01:02:39.64
Is that the next thing in your room?

1223
01:02:39.64 --> 01:02:41.64
Well, I was here for school.

1224
01:02:41.64 --> 01:02:46.64
So you know, went straight from graduating boot camp to then,

1225
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:49.64
you know, you're checking in over those barracks at Airborne School,

1226
01:02:49.64 --> 01:02:50.64
and that's three weeks.

1227
01:02:50.64 --> 01:02:54.64
And then I got the, maybe trip to, to,

1228
01:02:54.64 --> 01:02:56.64
for Bragg North Carolina.

1229
01:02:56.64 --> 01:02:58.64
So I drove from Benning to Bragg and checked in.

1230
01:02:58.64 --> 01:03:00.64
And so part of the 18 X-ray program is

1231
01:03:00.64 --> 01:03:02.64
is that there were preparation courses.

1232
01:03:02.64 --> 01:03:05.64
So, you know, special courses selection.

1233
01:03:05.64 --> 01:03:07.64
You've done not at Camp McCall, but there was a prep course

1234
01:03:07.64 --> 01:03:09.64
that happened at Fort Bragg.

1235
01:03:09.64 --> 01:03:11.64
It's a prep course for selection.

1236
01:03:11.64 --> 01:03:12.64
Correct.

1237
01:03:12.64 --> 01:03:14.64
Because you're coming just off straight along.

1238
01:03:14.64 --> 01:03:14.64
Yeah.

1239
01:03:14.64 --> 01:03:16.64
That was three weeks, maybe?

1240
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:17.64
And were they trying to teach you anything?

1241
01:03:17.64 --> 01:03:19.64
Or are they trying to get you physically ready?

1242
01:03:19.64 --> 01:03:22.64
So the main skill that they had to show you

1243
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:25.64
was rocking and laying navigation.

1244
01:03:25.64 --> 01:03:28.64
So all land navigation for us is 45 pounds dry

1245
01:03:28.64 --> 01:03:31.64
in the, the pine forest of North Carolina.

1246
01:03:31.64 --> 01:03:34.64
And you do a lot of rocking, but, but the skill is how to,

1247
01:03:34.64 --> 01:03:37.64
how to use map and compass in order to find points.

1248
01:03:37.64 --> 01:03:40.64
And besides that, they just, there was a lot of training,

1249
01:03:40.64 --> 01:03:44.64
quote, quote, to get us ready for, for the real selection.

1250
01:03:44.64 --> 01:03:47.64
Which is what they're making you hump, basically.

1251
01:03:47.64 --> 01:03:49.64
It well, no, there was a ton of, of PT.

1252
01:03:49.64 --> 01:03:51.64
I mean, a ton, right.

1253
01:03:51.64 --> 01:03:53.64
In, in that period of time, and in these were,

1254
01:03:53.64 --> 01:03:56.64
so part of this was, you said, this was called the prep course.

1255
01:03:56.64 --> 01:03:57.64
This was called SOPSY.

1256
01:03:57.64 --> 01:04:00.64
So special operations, preparation and conditioning.

1257
01:04:00.64 --> 01:04:04.64
And so what was really, really cool, in other words,

1258
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:08.64
get some, get some, get some all the time.

1259
01:04:08.64 --> 01:04:11.64
And, and so what was really, really cool, though,

1260
01:04:11.64 --> 01:04:16.64
was you had, this was early 2004, spring of 2004.

1261
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:20.64
And our cadre were some of the guys who had been

1262
01:04:20.64 --> 01:04:22.64
first into Afghanistan.

1263
01:04:22.64 --> 01:04:26.64
They were the horse soldiers in there that had literally come back.

1264
01:04:26.64 --> 01:04:29.64
Those are the guys that I wanted to be.

1265
01:04:29.64 --> 01:04:31.64
They were my heroes.

1266
01:04:31.64 --> 01:04:34.64
And everybody gets uncomfortable.

1267
01:04:34.64 --> 01:04:36.64
If they're sitting here, it would be hard to say,

1268
01:04:36.64 --> 01:04:38.64
you're my hero bro, right.

1269
01:04:38.64 --> 01:04:41.64
But, you know, I'll tell you that they were my heroes.

1270
01:04:41.64 --> 01:04:43.64
Because that's where I was in life.

1271
01:04:43.64 --> 01:04:47.64
I mean, they had gone and fought the Taliban for us

1272
01:04:47.64 --> 01:04:50.64
to, to avenge what happened on 9, 11.

1273
01:04:50.64 --> 01:04:53.64
And now they're telling me to go run and rock and do pushups.

1274
01:04:53.64 --> 01:04:55.64
And half the time they're doing it with us.

1275
01:04:55.64 --> 01:04:56.64
Because they're about to go back to war.

1276
01:04:56.64 --> 01:04:59.64
I mean, the way this works is you come back and you do some time

1277
01:04:59.64 --> 01:05:01.64
as a cadre or as an instructor.

1278
01:05:01.64 --> 01:05:04.64
And then you go back on on an ODA on an operational

1279
01:05:04.64 --> 01:05:07.64
to the Hashem Alfa and 18, if you will.

1280
01:05:07.64 --> 01:05:08.64
And you deploy again.

1281
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:11.64
So, you know, they were going to stay in physical,

1282
01:05:11.64 --> 01:05:13.64
great physical shape as well.

1283
01:05:13.64 --> 01:05:15.64
They didn't do everything with us, of course.

1284
01:05:15.64 --> 01:05:17.64
Roll around in the gig pit.

1285
01:05:17.64 --> 01:05:18.64
Do all that stuff.

1286
01:05:18.64 --> 01:05:20.64
They did it all that stuff.

1287
01:05:20.64 --> 01:05:22.64
They did it all that stuff.

1288
01:05:22.64 --> 01:05:24.64
But, you know, how do you not?

1289
01:05:24.64 --> 01:05:26.64
How do you quit on them?

1290
01:05:26.64 --> 01:05:28.64
These are the things that went through my head.

1291
01:05:28.64 --> 01:05:29.64
I mean, it was just,

1292
01:05:29.64 --> 01:05:31.64
do people quit during the prep course?

1293
01:05:31.64 --> 01:05:32.64
Of course.

1294
01:05:32.64 --> 01:05:33.64
So, it ended up being the prep.

1295
01:05:33.64 --> 01:05:35.64
The prep course was a lot harder than actual,

1296
01:05:35.64 --> 01:05:37.64
special force, a selection for me.

1297
01:05:37.64 --> 01:05:38.64
And for most of us, I mean,

1298
01:05:38.64 --> 01:05:41.64
the pass rate for those of us who went through this prep course

1299
01:05:41.64 --> 01:05:44.64
was something like 95%.

1300
01:05:44.64 --> 01:05:46.64
And how many people did you start the prep course with

1301
01:05:46.64 --> 01:05:48.64
and how many people watched out?

1302
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:50.64
The prep course there was significant.

1303
01:05:50.64 --> 01:05:52.64
I don't remember all the numbers exactly.

1304
01:05:52.64 --> 01:05:55.64
Let's say we started out with 200 and not,

1305
01:05:55.64 --> 01:05:57.64
you know, maybe 60 passed or something.

1306
01:05:57.64 --> 01:06:00.64
The prep course and then all 60 of us passed selection.

1307
01:06:00.64 --> 01:06:02.64
You know, something to that effect, right?

1308
01:06:02.64 --> 01:06:04.64
Now you've got everyone go through the prep course?

1309
01:06:04.64 --> 01:06:07.64
No, it was only for the guy that he straight off the street.

1310
01:06:07.64 --> 01:06:10.64
And so, the army would pull.

1311
01:06:10.64 --> 01:06:12.64
I mean, any job you have in the army,

1312
01:06:12.64 --> 01:06:15.64
you can put your packet in to go to special forces selection.

1313
01:06:15.64 --> 01:06:17.64
You don't get to go to the prep course,

1314
01:06:17.64 --> 01:06:19.64
because you're supposed to know

1315
01:06:19.64 --> 01:06:22.64
rocking and land navigation or you have to train on your own.

1316
01:06:22.64 --> 01:06:24.64
You know, you want to do that.

1317
01:06:24.64 --> 01:06:25.64
Two jobs, one paycheck.

1318
01:06:25.64 --> 01:06:26.64
You figure it out.

1319
01:06:26.64 --> 01:06:29.64
And you find time when you're at your unit deployed in Korea

1320
01:06:29.64 --> 01:06:31.64
to go rock and the learn land nav,

1321
01:06:31.64 --> 01:06:34.64
because it's, to stay proficient.

1322
01:06:34.64 --> 01:06:37.64
And so, yeah, so the prep course ended up being,

1323
01:06:37.64 --> 01:06:39.64
it was one of my favorite schools in the whole army.

1324
01:06:39.64 --> 01:06:42.64
I mean, I just, how much did you guys rock?

1325
01:06:42.64 --> 01:06:46.64
It was just, it was just, would you guys rock every day?

1326
01:06:46.64 --> 01:06:49.64
So short answer is if it's not every day,

1327
01:06:49.64 --> 01:06:51.64
it's just about every day.

1328
01:06:51.64 --> 01:06:55.64
And, and so, for us, I mean, the mechanics of the Q course

1329
01:06:55.64 --> 01:07:00.64
are all land navigation based in the pine forest of forbregg.

1330
01:07:00.64 --> 01:07:04.64
You always have, you start out on the kind of timed iterations.

1331
01:07:04.64 --> 01:07:06.64
It's 45 pounds dry, right?

1332
01:07:06.64 --> 01:07:09.64
So that means not counting water, not counting consumables,

1333
01:07:09.64 --> 01:07:10.64
stuff like that.

1334
01:07:10.64 --> 01:07:14.64
But land navigation meant, you know, you go from point A to point B,

1335
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:19.64
point B to point C, and when you meet cadry at the various points,

1336
01:07:19.64 --> 01:07:23.64
or you meet them at the end, and you show them the codes that you found

1337
01:07:23.64 --> 01:07:25.64
on the, the spots that you went to.

1338
01:07:25.64 --> 01:07:28.64
Whatever the case may be, they verified that you did the route correctly.

1339
01:07:28.64 --> 01:07:31.64
You're doing all of that with a rucksack on.

1340
01:07:31.64 --> 01:07:34.64
So you just learn the way of the rock.

1341
01:07:34.64 --> 01:07:37.64
I mean, and it just becomes an extension of your body.

1342
01:07:37.64 --> 01:07:42.64
You're moving with that ruck, and it is just a really powerful experience

1343
01:07:42.64 --> 01:07:49.64
to have that with you, and to get so strong with that ruck on your back all the time.

1344
01:07:49.64 --> 01:07:54.64
And then there's ruck PT, you know, you take your alice pack and put it above your head

1345
01:07:54.64 --> 01:07:58.64
and now start lunging or, you know, your, it's just the ruck is just your thing.

1346
01:07:58.64 --> 01:08:02.64
It's, you have your rifle, but we didn't do a lot of marksmanship stuff

1347
01:08:02.64 --> 01:08:04.64
in the Q course at all.

1348
01:08:04.64 --> 01:08:09.64
I mean, there's a couple days at the range, but once you get to your, once you get to your team,

1349
01:08:09.64 --> 01:08:14.64
there's a ton of, you know, but everything is just with the ruck.

1350
01:08:14.64 --> 01:08:18.64
And then you advanced up a trolling and the rucks get even heavier,

1351
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:19.64
and then you have, you know, your MOS phase.

1352
01:08:19.64 --> 01:08:22.64
I wouldn't be came a communication sergeant.

1353
01:08:22.64 --> 01:08:23.64
So it's radio.

1354
01:08:23.64 --> 01:08:24.64
Radio.

1355
01:08:24.64 --> 01:08:25.64
18 echo exactly.

1356
01:08:25.64 --> 01:08:30.64
So that was radios and stuff, but, you know, there was rucks and it was a ton of heat.

1357
01:08:30.64 --> 01:08:35.64
I was a radio mentor and I didn't go to the 18 echo course, but I went to the

1358
01:08:35.64 --> 01:08:40.64
seal equivalent at the time, which was out on the East Coast.

1359
01:08:40.64 --> 01:08:46.64
And yeah, well, to say that you carry a lot of weight is a very broad

1360
01:08:46.64 --> 01:08:47.64
understatement.

1361
01:08:47.64 --> 01:08:50.64
Batteries don't weigh nothing radios don't weigh nothing.

1362
01:08:50.64 --> 01:08:53.64
Just like bullets and, and all of that stuff and they don't weigh nothing.

1363
01:08:53.64 --> 01:08:56.64
So you have to get comfortable moving weight.

1364
01:08:56.64 --> 01:09:00.64
And they don't explicitly teach you how to ruck.

1365
01:09:00.64 --> 01:09:05.64
This is one of the things that I want to help impact that part of it.

1366
01:09:05.64 --> 01:09:10.64
Because they don't, there's not a sit down less than, hey, this is how your body's

1367
01:09:10.64 --> 01:09:11.64
going to adapt to rucking.

1368
01:09:11.64 --> 01:09:13.64
This is the weight you should start at.

1369
01:09:13.64 --> 01:09:16.64
This is how this is how you grow that over time.

1370
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:18.64
They just say, hey, this is all the stuff you're going to carry.

1371
01:09:18.64 --> 01:09:21.64
Go do it or do it or don't, right?

1372
01:09:21.64 --> 01:09:27.64
Now, when you haven't put a rock on for a while and like, this is something I

1373
01:09:27.64 --> 01:09:32.64
would remember like, let's say I was out doing close quarters combat or

1374
01:09:32.64 --> 01:09:36.64
Mount or something where we weren't really wearing a rock.

1375
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:39.64
And then all of a sudden, it'd be like, oh, okay, well, now we're going to the

1376
01:09:39.64 --> 01:09:41.64
desert and it's time to ruck up the fur.

1377
01:09:41.64 --> 01:09:44.64
When you put that thing on and you take, because it was me first putting like, oh,

1378
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:45.64
okay, no factor.

1379
01:09:45.64 --> 01:09:50.64
And then probably like the first 45 minutes of a

1380
01:09:50.64 --> 01:09:56.64
rock comp, you go, this is just going to suck.

1381
01:09:56.64 --> 01:09:59.64
And then over a couple days, you're like, okay, this is just the way it is.

1382
01:09:59.64 --> 01:10:04.64
And then eventually after two weeks or three weeks of that kind of training,

1383
01:10:04.64 --> 01:10:07.64
you actually become accustomed to it and you come used to it.

1384
01:10:07.64 --> 01:10:11.64
And that's where when you're talking about getting strong, you can, you get strong.

1385
01:10:11.64 --> 01:10:15.64
Your body adapts to this, this weight that you're going to have on your shoulders

1386
01:10:15.64 --> 01:10:17.64
and your back, your hips and your legs.

1387
01:10:17.64 --> 01:10:22.64
The other part of this though is the military takes the fun out of just about everything.

1388
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:26.64
Okay, they can't take the fun out of camaraderie, but everything else, like, oh,

1389
01:10:26.64 --> 01:10:27.64
you want to go jump out of airplanes.

1390
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:28.64
It'll be awesome.

1391
01:10:28.64 --> 01:10:30.64
Was airborne school awesome because for me, it wasn't awesome.

1392
01:10:30.64 --> 01:10:31.64
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1393
01:10:31.64 --> 01:10:32.64
Right.

1394
01:10:32.64 --> 01:10:35.64
I mean, want to go be scuba diving master, right?

1395
01:10:35.64 --> 01:10:37.64
Was that fun, Jocco?

1396
01:10:37.64 --> 01:10:40.64
Yeah, no, people asked me all the time, like, oh, so do you still dive?

1397
01:10:40.64 --> 01:10:45.64
I'm like, no, that was for me diving is being at 12 feet in the water,

1398
01:10:45.64 --> 01:10:48.64
complete blackness carrying a communist for four hours.

1399
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:50.64
And freezing, that's what diving is for me.

1400
01:10:50.64 --> 01:10:53.64
Like this every time I see like a person in the tropics,

1401
01:10:53.64 --> 01:10:56.64
looking at fish, they're in, they're a little fin, yeah,

1402
01:10:56.64 --> 01:10:59.64
and they're just like, you know, no idea.

1403
01:10:59.64 --> 01:11:05.64
So rocking is not as simple as, oh, it's, it's just sucks when you first do it.

1404
01:11:05.64 --> 01:11:09.64
I mean, the military 45 dry and you're expected to move really fast.

1405
01:11:09.64 --> 01:11:12.64
That's a, that's not what I would recommend as a beginner's weight, right?

1406
01:11:12.64 --> 01:11:15.64
Now, it's just in the army, that's kind of what it was.

1407
01:11:15.64 --> 01:11:17.64
How good were you at rocking?

1408
01:11:17.64 --> 01:11:20.64
So I was not good at a lot of things.

1409
01:11:20.64 --> 01:11:24.64
I was, I had to learn how to not overthink stuff.

1410
01:11:24.64 --> 01:11:27.64
You know, rocking was my thing.

1411
01:11:27.64 --> 01:11:32.64
I mean, I got really lugs and it just came easy to me.

1412
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:36.64
So more weight load me up and, you know, when we would go on our patrols,

1413
01:11:36.64 --> 01:11:38.64
they would not put me at point, right?

1414
01:11:38.64 --> 01:11:41.64
Because when you're at point, you're sort of setting the pace and getting the hasty

1415
01:11:41.64 --> 01:11:42.64
slow down.

1416
01:11:42.64 --> 01:11:44.64
I mean, I'm just, I'm six four.

1417
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:45.64
My legs are really long.

1418
01:11:45.64 --> 01:11:49.64
I don't, you know, other things came a lot harder to me.

1419
01:11:49.64 --> 01:11:51.64
Can you win a sprint?

1420
01:11:51.64 --> 01:11:54.64
That's 200, 100 meter sprint.

1421
01:11:54.64 --> 01:11:55.64
Will you win that?

1422
01:11:55.64 --> 01:11:56.64
No, absolutely not.

1423
01:11:56.64 --> 01:12:00.64
Will you win a, will you win a six mile run?

1424
01:12:00.64 --> 01:12:04.64
No, I would, I would do okay at, at the running part.

1425
01:12:04.64 --> 01:12:07.64
I mean, there is a cardiovascular part to, to rocking.

1426
01:12:07.64 --> 01:12:10.64
And at the time, I would you win a,

1427
01:12:10.64 --> 01:12:13.64
ten mile rock hump.

1428
01:12:13.64 --> 01:12:16.64
So I was, I was always very, very competitive with that.

1429
01:12:16.64 --> 01:12:18.64
I mean, taught a few guys.

1430
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:19.64
I, I'm similar to that.

1431
01:12:19.64 --> 01:12:21.64
Like I was not the fastest sprinter at all.

1432
01:12:21.64 --> 01:12:24.64
I was not the fastest, you know, six mile run.

1433
01:12:24.64 --> 01:12:27.64
But with a rock sack on, it was like an equalizer for me.

1434
01:12:27.64 --> 01:12:33.64
And ended up, our physiological guys would like, yeah,

1435
01:12:33.64 --> 01:12:36.64
you have medium twitch muscle.

1436
01:12:36.64 --> 01:12:39.64
That's what they said, which they, they didn't really discover this medium twitch.

1437
01:12:39.64 --> 01:12:41.64
They're like, yeah, you're not super fast in a sprint.

1438
01:12:41.64 --> 01:12:44.64
And you're not great with this long endurance.

1439
01:12:44.64 --> 01:12:47.64
But this thing where you have weight to move.

1440
01:12:47.64 --> 01:12:50.64
And for a long time, that's what you're good at.

1441
01:12:50.64 --> 01:12:51.64
And I was like, okay, that's cool.

1442
01:12:51.64 --> 01:12:52.64
Cool with me.

1443
01:12:52.64 --> 01:12:53.64
And it was really good for being a radio man.

1444
01:12:53.64 --> 01:12:55.64
Because I always had all this extra weight.

1445
01:12:55.64 --> 01:12:58.64
And I could always kind of do good with it, you know,

1446
01:12:58.64 --> 01:13:01.64
and not that I'm some stellar rock humber.

1447
01:13:01.64 --> 01:13:03.64
But it was better, I was better at that than I was.

1448
01:13:03.64 --> 01:13:04.64
I was sprinting.

1449
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:06.64
I was better at that than I was at the distance running.

1450
01:13:06.64 --> 01:13:07.64
And it was something that was very,

1451
01:13:07.64 --> 01:13:10.64
I was very lucky to have that because, like I said,

1452
01:13:10.64 --> 01:13:13.64
carrying a radio is sucks, carrying a radio.

1453
01:13:13.64 --> 01:13:15.64
And if you're not like have, if you don't have some kind of

1454
01:13:15.64 --> 01:13:18.64
propensity for it, it's going to be a real problem.

1455
01:13:18.64 --> 01:13:21.64
Yeah, I mean, you know, the rocks are really heavy.

1456
01:13:21.64 --> 01:13:25.64
I mean, the heaviest rock I carried in the, the Q cores was 125 pounds.

1457
01:13:25.64 --> 01:13:27.64
We had a jump in with that.

1458
01:13:27.64 --> 01:13:29.64
And then rock that for a day.

1459
01:13:29.64 --> 01:13:32.64
And that was the culminating exercise called Rob and Sage.

1460
01:13:32.64 --> 01:13:35.64
And so when a lot of times military folks will say,

1461
01:13:35.64 --> 01:13:38.64
rocking sucks, like yeah, that kind of rock and really sucks, right?

1462
01:13:38.64 --> 01:13:41.64
And then what you do is you show up to where you're supposed to be

1463
01:13:41.64 --> 01:13:43.64
and you dig fighting positions, right?

1464
01:13:43.64 --> 01:13:47.64
And you, you know, and then the cadre comes and he blows you out of

1465
01:13:47.64 --> 01:13:50.64
those fighting positions with already Sims.

1466
01:13:50.64 --> 01:13:52.64
Okay, time to go.

1467
01:13:52.64 --> 01:13:55.64
And then you go and you dig more fighting positions.

1468
01:13:55.64 --> 01:13:57.64
And you don't sleep and you don't eat.

1469
01:13:57.64 --> 01:13:59.64
And you got a rucksack on your back, and you say man,

1470
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:00.64
rocking sucks.

1471
01:14:00.64 --> 01:14:03.64
Like, well, it's not just the rocking that sucks.

1472
01:14:03.64 --> 01:14:07.64
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

1473
01:14:07.64 --> 01:14:13.64
it's, it's, um, another one of those things where, yeah, I guess the military makes it bad, but.

1474
01:14:13.64 --> 01:14:16.64
Yeah, and when you get done with it, you feel good.

1475
01:14:16.64 --> 01:14:23.64
Some of the best physical experiences of my entire life have come after a long rock,

1476
01:14:23.64 --> 01:14:29.64
and you take that rock off and you sit down, sort of the, the rucksack flop.

1477
01:14:29.64 --> 01:14:35.64
It's called, you just sort of sit down on the rock, and then you take the shoulder straps off,

1478
01:14:35.64 --> 01:14:39.64
and you can feel the blood flow just going back everywhere in your body.

1479
01:14:39.64 --> 01:14:44.64
And it's like your whole body feels like it does after you take ski boots off.

1480
01:14:44.64 --> 01:14:47.64
And it's just so awesome.

1481
01:14:47.64 --> 01:14:49.64
You can just feel what you did.

1482
01:14:49.64 --> 01:14:51.64
I just love it.

1483
01:14:51.64 --> 01:14:59.64
So, how long is the communications part of your, like, how long was the 18, 18,

1484
01:14:59.64 --> 01:15:01.64
uh, 18 at the core of the boat?

1485
01:15:01.64 --> 01:15:02.64
It was like three months.

1486
01:15:02.64 --> 01:15:04.64
And so it was, did you learn more scode?

1487
01:15:04.64 --> 01:15:07.64
I was the first class that did not learn more scode.

1488
01:15:07.64 --> 01:15:09.64
So it would have been six months.

1489
01:15:09.64 --> 01:15:10.64
Week.

1490
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:11.64
Week.

1491
01:15:11.64 --> 01:15:15.64
I learned, I had to learn more scode, which I thought was completely stupid,

1492
01:15:15.64 --> 01:15:18.64
and the guy that was teaching us the class was like,

1493
01:15:18.64 --> 01:15:21.64
any event of a new car all across.

1494
01:15:21.64 --> 01:15:25.64
Morris Codal be the only thing punchin through the ionosphere, and I'm like,

1495
01:15:25.64 --> 01:15:28.64
sound the good to me, bro.

1496
01:15:28.64 --> 01:15:31.64
I mean, look, it's life has risk, right?

1497
01:15:31.64 --> 01:15:35.64
And when you're running the schoolhouse or whatever, you have to weigh,

1498
01:15:35.64 --> 01:15:41.64
however many thousand guys a year, wasting or not wasting, but spending three months of their life

1499
01:15:41.64 --> 01:15:44.64
on a horse coat versus this decision.

1500
01:15:44.64 --> 01:15:48.64
If I were a horse, you know, don't give me wrong. I support this decision.

1501
01:15:48.64 --> 01:15:51.64
It was not very, didn't make it a lot of sense when I did it.

1502
01:15:51.64 --> 01:15:53.64
So it's, so it's a three month school that you went to.

1503
01:15:53.64 --> 01:15:56.64
It was three months, and it was run by these God bless me.

1504
01:15:56.64 --> 01:15:59.64
It was these two third group guys named Blade and Razor.

1505
01:15:59.64 --> 01:16:03.64
I mean, just, you run in your military career and you have these instructors

1506
01:16:03.64 --> 01:16:09.64
that really just teach you things about life, and it's never because they make it easy,

1507
01:16:09.64 --> 01:16:11.64
but they, they give you a why.

1508
01:16:11.64 --> 01:16:16.64
You know, this is important because, and you know, they had just, they were dive,

1509
01:16:16.64 --> 01:16:21.64
they were dive guys within SF, which is just, it's just another suck school that you go to

1510
01:16:21.64 --> 01:16:25.64
down in Key West, and it's a real suck school, not gentlemen's course at all,

1511
01:16:25.64 --> 01:16:28.64
and you're already a greenbrain, you go do that, and then you join a dive team,

1512
01:16:28.64 --> 01:16:31.64
and it's just another sort of notch, right, that you have.

1513
01:16:31.64 --> 01:16:35.64
And so they take their physical fitness within our community, even just a little bit more.

1514
01:16:35.64 --> 01:16:38.64
And they come back and they basically said, hey,

1515
01:16:38.64 --> 01:16:43.64
there's going to be no slugs that come through this course ever, right?

1516
01:16:43.64 --> 01:16:46.64
And so, I mean, it was just you would show up first thing in the morning,

1517
01:16:46.64 --> 01:16:50.64
and Blade would drive his F950 or whatever it was.

1518
01:16:50.64 --> 01:16:54.64
This thing was just enormous, and he was blasting his music,

1519
01:16:54.64 --> 01:16:57.64
and he would say, welcome to Pain Roulette, right?

1520
01:16:57.64 --> 01:16:59.64
And it was basically like, we're going to play a song,

1521
01:16:59.64 --> 01:17:02.64
and you're going to do an exercise for that entire song.

1522
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:06.64
And, you know, when stairway to heaven comes on, and you're doing push-ups,

1523
01:17:06.64 --> 01:17:10.64
that sucks. But the thing was, is he was doing it with us.

1524
01:17:10.64 --> 01:17:13.64
So I'm going to go back to third group when I'm done here.

1525
01:17:13.64 --> 01:17:16.64
I'm going to take a team, and we're going to go back to Afghanistan,

1526
01:17:16.64 --> 01:17:20.64
and we need to be ready, and you all need to be ready.

1527
01:17:20.64 --> 01:17:26.64
And those who stress the seriousness of the job and the ways that you can become a professional,

1528
01:17:26.64 --> 01:17:29.64
and you're trade, those are the ones that you respect the most that you,

1529
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:33.64
you, you, you, you, you, you earn to please them because you respect them.

1530
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:36.64
And, and that was how I felt in that course.

1531
01:17:36.64 --> 01:17:40.64
So it was, again, physical fitness was just the foundation,

1532
01:17:40.64 --> 01:17:42.64
and you have to have it in the community.

1533
01:17:42.64 --> 01:17:47.64
You have to be able to do the work physically in order to fight for your country.

1534
01:17:47.64 --> 01:17:52.64
And so yes, we learned some skills, but most of the training was kind of outdated.

1535
01:17:52.64 --> 01:17:54.64
We didn't deal with gun trucks set-ups.

1536
01:17:54.64 --> 01:17:57.64
We didn't deal with any of the things that we were actually going to go do in war.

1537
01:17:57.64 --> 01:18:01.64
We learned the basics of radio functionality and stuff like that,

1538
01:18:01.64 --> 01:18:04.64
and I carry really heavy rucksacks full of batteries and radio's.

1539
01:18:04.64 --> 01:18:06.64
Did you string up HFN 10?

1540
01:18:06.64 --> 01:18:07.64
We did, trees.

1541
01:18:07.64 --> 01:18:10.64
Yes. That was one of the go-no-go events.

1542
01:18:10.64 --> 01:18:17.64
And it's, you know, there's a lot of excuses that you can actually claim that a reality

1543
01:18:17.64 --> 01:18:22.64
when it comes to being a radio guy because how well that stuff happens.

1544
01:18:22.64 --> 01:18:26.64
It's sun spots, and you know, the universe didn't want this con-

1545
01:18:26.64 --> 01:18:28.64
You're not in your sun spot cycle.

1546
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:34.64
So there's sun spots in the AO today, and you know, but ultimately you have to just keep trying.

1547
01:18:34.64 --> 01:18:38.64
It's like anything else you have to just persevere and figure out how to make your shots.

1548
01:18:38.64 --> 01:18:42.64
I used to be so kind of psycho and fanatical about making comms.

1549
01:18:42.64 --> 01:18:46.64
Like that was my job, and I was gonna make comms.

1550
01:18:46.64 --> 01:18:50.64
And I had one of my evaluations that said,

1551
01:18:50.64 --> 01:18:55.64
made communications 100% of attempts.

1552
01:18:55.64 --> 01:18:59.64
And I was like, yeah, because they asked, you know, they asked for us to submit bullets.

1553
01:18:59.64 --> 01:19:02.64
You know, like, you know, I was like an E4 in the teams.

1554
01:19:02.64 --> 01:19:06.64
And they're like, I said, made communications 100% of the time,

1555
01:19:06.64 --> 01:19:13.64
which I was very, very proud of because as you know, that was not easy to accomplish.

1556
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:14.64
That's a lot of a company.

1557
01:19:14.64 --> 01:19:16.64
Yeah, 100% that's the same.

1558
01:19:16.64 --> 01:19:18.64
100% comms.

1559
01:19:18.64 --> 01:19:23.64
I was like, because I would just be a psycho about, and what that meant was,

1560
01:19:23.64 --> 01:19:30.64
see, what that really meant was, I would come up with communication plans that had, you know, multiple backups,

1561
01:19:30.64 --> 01:19:33.64
where, hey, look, this, this comm window didn't work.

1562
01:19:33.64 --> 01:19:36.64
So that's, then you'd bump to this one, and that one didn't work.

1563
01:19:36.64 --> 01:19:38.64
You could bump to this one. So eventually, I'm gonna get comms.

1564
01:19:38.64 --> 01:19:41.64
I'm gonna make it happen 100% with that.

1565
01:19:41.64 --> 01:19:44.64
But so look, did you gain confidence from that?

1566
01:19:44.64 --> 01:19:45.64
Of course you did, right?

1567
01:19:45.64 --> 01:19:49.64
And is that the kind of confidence that you, you draw upon later in life,

1568
01:19:49.64 --> 01:19:51.64
and life gets really, really hard.

1569
01:19:51.64 --> 01:19:55.64
I mean, all you had to do was figure out how to move a little bit,

1570
01:19:55.64 --> 01:20:00.64
and you know, make sure the canopy wasn't covering wherever your shots had to be made or whatever.

1571
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:05.64
But later in life, life gets really hard, and you draw upon, hey, I know how to do this.

1572
01:20:05.64 --> 01:20:09.64
I just keep persevering, and I'll get it. We'll get it.

1573
01:20:09.64 --> 01:20:10.64
Yeah.

1574
01:20:10.64 --> 01:20:16.64
Was there anything else in the Q course that kind of surprised you or you had like trouble with?

1575
01:20:16.64 --> 01:20:22.64
So it goes back to kind of overthinking stuff.

1576
01:20:22.64 --> 01:20:28.64
And the best example that I have of this is, you know, you learn the differences in ambushes, right?

1577
01:20:28.64 --> 01:20:29.64
Techniques.

1578
01:20:29.64 --> 01:20:31.64
There's a linear ambush, and there's an L shape ambush, right?

1579
01:20:31.64 --> 01:20:34.64
There's sectors of fire, and where's the enemy coming from?

1580
01:20:34.64 --> 01:20:37.64
You know, it's terrain, and all these various factors dependent.

1581
01:20:37.64 --> 01:20:41.64
And the cadre, there was, you know, our team of, say, 15 or so,

1582
01:20:41.64 --> 01:20:45.64
and he's giving us a class on this, which is sort of what you reference in the intro here.

1583
01:20:45.64 --> 01:20:49.64
Sure, you have the opportunity to ask questions, don't ask questions.

1584
01:20:49.64 --> 01:20:50.64
You know, that kind of deal.

1585
01:20:50.64 --> 01:20:53.64
And of course I ask a question, you know, college boy, right?

1586
01:20:53.64 --> 01:20:56.64
Like so, cadre, I don't really understand the difference

1587
01:20:56.64 --> 01:21:00.64
or why we would choose a linear ambush here instead of an L shape ambush.

1588
01:21:00.64 --> 01:21:07.64
And it was, hey, you go drag your face in the dirt, and until you reach that spot over there,

1589
01:21:07.64 --> 01:21:12.64
and think about it, because this is the ambush as I've taught it.

1590
01:21:12.64 --> 01:21:16.64
Right? And that was one of those moments where I'm like, you know, I'm not going to ask any more questions.

1591
01:21:16.64 --> 01:21:18.64
I'm just going to do exactly what I'm told.

1592
01:21:18.64 --> 01:21:24.64
And that took time to really sink in.

1593
01:21:24.64 --> 01:21:29.64
And you know, special forces in theory is a place where you're supposed to think critically

1594
01:21:29.64 --> 01:21:33.64
and you're supposed to ask questions and you're supposed to do all these things, and you are.

1595
01:21:33.64 --> 01:21:39.64
You just have to learn when to do that and when not to, and you have to trust the judgment of the guys around you.

1596
01:21:39.64 --> 01:21:42.64
And you know, that took some time for me.

1597
01:21:42.64 --> 01:21:49.64
And then the other two big things were that infill in Robin's stage with 125 pound rucksack for a day.

1598
01:21:49.64 --> 01:21:52.64
And then, you know, that was, that was horrific.

1599
01:21:52.64 --> 01:21:55.64
And every green barray you ever talked to.

1600
01:21:55.64 --> 01:21:59.64
If you mentioned the sage in fill, they will cringe just a little bit.

1601
01:21:59.64 --> 01:22:00.64
With the distance.

1602
01:22:00.64 --> 01:22:07.64
I mean, it was, all I remember is, you may be moving a mile an hour.

1603
01:22:07.64 --> 01:22:13.64
I mean, 125 pounds patrolling through the pine forest and you're doing it for 18 hours.

1604
01:22:13.64 --> 01:22:18.64
So they eventually put me in charge of the communication course at sealed team on.

1605
01:22:18.64 --> 01:22:22.64
And I only ran two of my think.

1606
01:22:22.64 --> 01:22:24.64
And we would weigh the guys on insert.

1607
01:22:24.64 --> 01:22:27.64
It was a six day recon.

1608
01:22:27.64 --> 01:22:33.64
And they would all be 120, 110, 230 pounds of gear.

1609
01:22:33.64 --> 01:22:45.64
And it was, it was so savage this course that I put these guys through that, you know, when I look back at my life.

1610
01:22:45.64 --> 01:22:48.64
I think, man, those guys were ready for anything.

1611
01:22:48.64 --> 01:22:51.64
And this is like 1997.

1612
01:22:51.64 --> 01:22:57.64
Like, there was, I was, I was, we'll say, wanted them to be ready.

1613
01:22:57.64 --> 01:22:58.64
And they were ready.

1614
01:22:58.64 --> 01:23:02.64
They probably never got tested that way again for the rest of their lives.

1615
01:23:02.64 --> 01:23:07.64
So I mean, the sage info was the culminating exercise of this special forces qualification.

1616
01:23:07.64 --> 01:23:09.64
Yeah, you know, that's, you got to bring it.

1617
01:23:09.64 --> 01:23:15.64
Right. If you're up there and you're setting the training agenda, you say, this, this needs to be something memorable.

1618
01:23:15.64 --> 01:23:16.64
And it was.

1619
01:23:16.64 --> 01:23:17.64
Yeah.

1620
01:23:17.64 --> 01:23:18.64
Yeah.

1621
01:23:18.64 --> 01:23:22.64
These guys came out of the field like new people.

1622
01:23:22.64 --> 01:23:26.64
And, and had, they, it was pretty awesome.

1623
01:23:26.64 --> 01:23:28.64
It was pretty awesome.

1624
01:23:28.64 --> 01:23:30.64
These one guys lied to me.

1625
01:23:30.64 --> 01:23:35.64
And, um, they, they, they, I got up to their layup point.

1626
01:23:35.64 --> 01:23:38.64
And I said, hey, you guys missed a calm window.

1627
01:23:38.64 --> 01:23:39.64
Well, what happened?

1628
01:23:39.64 --> 01:23:41.64
And they kind of looked at me.

1629
01:23:41.64 --> 01:23:43.64
And so I separated the team.

1630
01:23:43.64 --> 01:23:47.64
And I started asking, what kind of antenna, you know, well, no, we were up for the calm window.

1631
01:23:47.64 --> 01:23:48.64
We just didn't make calm.

1632
01:23:48.64 --> 01:23:51.64
So I was like, oh, because meanwhile I'm monitoring everything.

1633
01:23:51.64 --> 01:23:56.64
And they said, so one group, I said, what kind of antenna did you set up?

1634
01:23:56.64 --> 01:23:57.64
And one guy said, like, a long wire.

1635
01:23:57.64 --> 01:23:59.64
And then I said, they said, like, what kind of antenna did you guys set up?

1636
01:23:59.64 --> 01:24:04.64
He said, oh, a horizontal, die by pole or whatever.

1637
01:24:04.64 --> 01:24:07.64
And I'm like, oh, that's not what the other guy said.

1638
01:24:07.64 --> 01:24:09.64
So they knew they just knew.

1639
01:24:09.64 --> 01:24:13.64
And I was like, get your gear ready.

1640
01:24:13.64 --> 01:24:14.64
Get ready to move out.

1641
01:24:14.64 --> 01:24:15.64
And they're like, oh, God.

1642
01:24:15.64 --> 01:24:20.64
So I had these guys hump to this water tower on the top of a mountain.

1643
01:24:20.64 --> 01:24:24.64
And they were already on the top of a different mountain.

1644
01:24:24.64 --> 01:24:26.64
And then, and then they got to the water tower.

1645
01:24:26.64 --> 01:24:29.64
I didn't let them put the rocks down that got up.

1646
01:24:29.64 --> 01:24:31.64
And I was like, go back to where you just came from.

1647
01:24:31.64 --> 01:24:33.64
And they were like, they went back.

1648
01:24:33.64 --> 01:24:35.64
And then they get back, I'm waiting for them again.

1649
01:24:35.64 --> 01:24:37.64
And they come walking up.

1650
01:24:37.64 --> 01:24:40.64
And I said, go back to the water tower.

1651
01:24:40.64 --> 01:24:43.64
And I saw the look on one guy's face.

1652
01:24:43.64 --> 01:24:47.64
And I said, if you don't want to go, you can just throw your rock in the truck here.

1653
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:48.64
And we'll be good.

1654
01:24:48.64 --> 01:24:49.64
I'll take you back to camp.

1655
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:51.64
And the other guy was like, negative jockey.

1656
01:24:51.64 --> 01:24:52.64
We got this.

1657
01:24:52.64 --> 01:24:53.64
And they moved out.

1658
01:24:53.64 --> 01:24:54.64
So I was pretty stoked.

1659
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:56.64
But yeah, don't lie to the contrary.

1660
01:24:56.64 --> 01:24:57.64
It's what I'm saying.

1661
01:24:57.64 --> 01:24:59.64
No integrity violations are a big deal.

1662
01:24:59.64 --> 01:25:00.64
Yeah, yeah.

1663
01:25:00.64 --> 01:25:01.64
Don't lie to the contrary.

1664
01:25:01.64 --> 01:25:05.64
And anyways, you know, you can't move with a lot of weight.

1665
01:25:05.64 --> 01:25:07.64
You know, those guys humped those guys.

1666
01:25:07.64 --> 01:25:08.64
I forget I measured out.

1667
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:13.64
They was, I put those guys through a ridiculously punitive road march.

1668
01:25:13.64 --> 01:25:16.64
And they still made their extract, which was cool.

1669
01:25:16.64 --> 01:25:19.64
Yeah, I mean, I think in the higher echelons of leadership,

1670
01:25:19.64 --> 01:25:23.64
there should be thought given to how do you reduce the load of

1671
01:25:23.64 --> 01:25:28.64
soldiers because there's an inherent bravado element that comes from being the guy that

1672
01:25:28.64 --> 01:25:32.64
carried 125 pounds that you don't, the idea.

1673
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:34.64
We were borderline combat in a fight.

1674
01:25:34.64 --> 01:25:35.64
That's what's good about.

1675
01:25:35.64 --> 01:25:40.64
What's good about carrying 120 pounds is you realize, hey, this is dumb.

1676
01:25:40.64 --> 01:25:41.64
This is actually not smart.

1677
01:25:41.64 --> 01:25:45.64
And if we got into a firefight right now, this rock's act is getting left.

1678
01:25:45.64 --> 01:25:48.64
And if we lose the firefight or if we have to break contact,

1679
01:25:48.64 --> 01:25:51.64
I'm never going to see that thing again with my radio with my water,

1680
01:25:51.64 --> 01:25:52.64
with whatever else.

1681
01:25:52.64 --> 01:25:55.64
So, yeah, you should realize that this is dumb.

1682
01:25:55.64 --> 01:25:58.64
And carrying that much weight is not going to be smart.

1683
01:25:58.64 --> 01:26:00.64
You're going to be fairly ineffective in other times.

1684
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:01.64
We got to do it.

1685
01:26:01.64 --> 01:26:02.64
Yes, absolutely.

1686
01:26:02.64 --> 01:26:04.64
But you got to really, really think about it.

1687
01:26:04.64 --> 01:26:08.64
So it's a good lesson from that perspective to minimize the amount of weight that you're

1688
01:26:08.64 --> 01:26:09.64
actually getting.

1689
01:26:09.64 --> 01:26:13.64
Like, like, I never, I would carry so little food.

1690
01:26:13.64 --> 01:26:17.64
I'm sure you were like this, too, because we just, I mean, as a radioman,

1691
01:26:17.64 --> 01:26:20.64
you had batteries, you had radios, and I carried water.

1692
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:22.64
And like, that's it.

1693
01:26:22.64 --> 01:26:27.64
And because I would carry one MRME, just the main meal, just the just the whatever that main thing

1694
01:26:27.64 --> 01:26:29.64
was, I'd carry one of those per day.

1695
01:26:29.64 --> 01:26:30.64
That's it.

1696
01:26:30.64 --> 01:26:31.64
That's what we're going to feel with.

1697
01:26:31.64 --> 01:26:32.64
Because I could carry anything else.

1698
01:26:32.64 --> 01:26:34.64
Any extra weight just didn't want it.

1699
01:26:34.64 --> 01:26:35.64
It wasn't worth it.

1700
01:26:35.64 --> 01:26:39.64
Yeah, I mean, so we just see though,

1701
01:26:39.64 --> 01:26:43.64
even in combat, there's not enough.

1702
01:26:43.64 --> 01:26:45.64
There's planning for everything.

1703
01:26:45.64 --> 01:26:48.64
If you have to have everything on you all the time.

1704
01:26:48.64 --> 01:26:50.64
And speed is security.

1705
01:26:50.64 --> 01:26:53.64
That's one of, that's a foundational doctrine thing.

1706
01:26:53.64 --> 01:26:54.64
Right?

1707
01:26:54.64 --> 01:26:57.64
The faster you can move, the safer that is.

1708
01:26:57.64 --> 01:26:59.64
There's more security and inherently.

1709
01:26:59.64 --> 01:27:03.64
And when you weigh more, you have more stuff weighing you down.

1710
01:27:03.64 --> 01:27:05.64
You're not going to move as fast.

1711
01:27:05.64 --> 01:27:08.64
So, you know, I mean, I think this is just one of those things where

1712
01:27:08.64 --> 01:27:13.64
in the military, some conversation around that is good.

1713
01:27:13.64 --> 01:27:14.64
Because Bravado is great.

1714
01:27:14.64 --> 01:27:16.64
125 pound training rucks.

1715
01:27:16.64 --> 01:27:17.64
Great.

1716
01:27:17.64 --> 01:27:20.64
That's a lesson in the suck, right?

1717
01:27:20.64 --> 01:27:22.64
We couldn't fight with that.

1718
01:27:22.64 --> 01:27:23.64
It's too much.

1719
01:27:23.64 --> 01:27:23.64
Yeah.

1720
01:27:23.64 --> 01:27:25.64
It's too much.

1721
01:27:25.64 --> 01:27:27.64
So, when you get done with a Q course,

1722
01:27:27.64 --> 01:27:30.64
how do you guys figure out when you get orders?

1723
01:27:30.64 --> 01:27:31.64
How do you get orders?

1724
01:27:31.64 --> 01:27:33.64
Yeah, so they just tell you.

1725
01:27:33.64 --> 01:27:36.64
I mean, so for us, we also have language training and stuff like that.

1726
01:27:36.64 --> 01:27:37.64
Language did you do?

1727
01:27:37.64 --> 01:27:39.64
So I actually passed out of German.

1728
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:42.64
And so that assigned you to learn German from.

1729
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:45.64
I lived in Germany for about a year.

1730
01:27:45.64 --> 01:27:46.64
When was that?

1731
01:27:46.64 --> 01:27:48.64
In college, I studied abroad there.

1732
01:27:48.64 --> 01:27:52.64
And then I had a buddy who was a, he was a border,

1733
01:27:52.64 --> 01:27:55.64
a exchange student in America, my high school.

1734
01:27:55.64 --> 01:27:58.64
And so I lived with him for a summer while I was in college and

1735
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:00.64
lived in their house and picked it up.

1736
01:28:00.64 --> 01:28:02.64
So, just passed out of the language portion.

1737
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:07.64
And so that got me to 10th group, which the classic area of operations is

1738
01:28:07.64 --> 01:28:08.64
Europe.

1739
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:10.64
And then there's, you know, in the global war on terror though, you get pulled everywhere.

1740
01:28:10.64 --> 01:28:13.64
And so our, ours ended up being a rack.

1741
01:28:13.64 --> 01:28:16.64
So that's when you showed up there.

1742
01:28:16.64 --> 01:28:17.64
What's it like when you get there?

1743
01:28:17.64 --> 01:28:20.64
Are you just immediately putting to an ODI team?

1744
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:25.64
You're supposed to be, I hung out on the B team for a little bit because for whatever reason.

1745
01:28:25.64 --> 01:28:29.64
Sometimes you get not the best spot to get put on.

1746
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:33.64
And there's one B team that supports all the A teams in a company.

1747
01:28:33.64 --> 01:28:37.64
So there's six, six ODIs or six A teams and one B team,

1748
01:28:37.64 --> 01:28:39.64
A headquarter support.

1749
01:28:39.64 --> 01:28:41.64
And so, you know, no matter what, it's,

1750
01:28:41.64 --> 01:28:45.64
it's like you graduate and you think you're this great Billy Badass Green

1751
01:28:45.64 --> 01:28:49.64
Bre, and Ray, and then you find out that in your company where you're showing up,

1752
01:28:49.64 --> 01:28:53.64
everyone's a Green Bre, and they've actually done stuff as a Green Bre in war.

1753
01:28:53.64 --> 01:28:55.64
And you've done none of that.

1754
01:28:55.64 --> 01:28:58.64
And so, you know, the floors are never clean enough.

1755
01:28:58.64 --> 01:29:00.64
The heads never clean enough.

1756
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:05.64
That's your job and you're supposed to shut up and learn from the people that are around you.

1757
01:29:05.64 --> 01:29:08.64
That's so how much time did you spend in the B team?

1758
01:29:08.64 --> 01:29:12.64
Probably five months and then we deployed.

1759
01:29:12.64 --> 01:29:14.64
Yeah, so about five months.

1760
01:29:14.64 --> 01:29:18.64
And I went to some schools in that process, though, that sent me to a school called SoTac,

1761
01:29:18.64 --> 01:29:22.64
which is the Army Special Forces equivalent of J-Tac.

1762
01:29:22.64 --> 01:29:26.64
So, special operation, terminal attack controller, of course.

1763
01:29:26.64 --> 01:29:30.64
So learn how to call in in bombs, how to human Arizona.

1764
01:29:30.64 --> 01:29:34.64
And so, I spent some time in went to a shooting school and did that type of stuff,

1765
01:29:34.64 --> 01:29:42.64
but didn't join a team until the spring of 2007 in Iraq.

1766
01:29:42.64 --> 01:29:45.64
And then what was that deployment like?

1767
01:29:45.64 --> 01:29:49.64
Right, so this was the, you know, this was the surge, right?

1768
01:29:49.64 --> 01:29:51.64
This was a messy time in Iraq.

1769
01:29:51.64 --> 01:29:53.64
I know, you know, you don't have to tell you that.

1770
01:29:53.64 --> 01:29:59.64
And we were down in South Starterdought and Bosra, which was just, you know,

1771
01:29:59.64 --> 01:30:04.64
I mean, for people out there, I mean, Bosra was more aligned with Iran

1772
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:09.64
through the Shea connection than it was with the Sunnis that were coming out of Baghdad, right?

1773
01:30:09.64 --> 01:30:11.64
And, and on more province.

1774
01:30:11.64 --> 01:30:17.64
I mean, so anytime historically Saddam had issues, he just sent his henchmen down to Bosra

1775
01:30:17.64 --> 01:30:18.64
and shown what's up.

1776
01:30:18.64 --> 01:30:23.64
And there was just a lot of, it was just a chaotic time in that,

1777
01:30:23.64 --> 01:30:27.64
IEDs, so roadside bombs, and then specifically EFP's.

1778
01:30:27.64 --> 01:30:29.64
So, explosively foreign penetrators, right?

1779
01:30:29.64 --> 01:30:34.64
I mean, yeah, I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a roadside bomb

1780
01:30:34.64 --> 01:30:40.64
rather than that would cut through anything.

1781
01:30:40.64 --> 01:30:46.64
So it would, it would cut a hole through a humvee like you would cut butter with a knife, right?

1782
01:30:46.64 --> 01:30:50.64
And those were coming out of Iran and that's, that was sort of RIO.

1783
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:56.64
And those, the, the missions out of, out of Bosra were just loaded with I,

1784
01:30:56.64 --> 01:31:00.64
I mean, big convoy stuff, lots of IEDs.

1785
01:31:00.64 --> 01:31:05.64
And then I got sent to a team in, that was operating in out of Tolio,

1786
01:31:05.64 --> 01:31:06.64
Air Force Base.

1787
01:31:06.64 --> 01:31:08.64
So Nazaria area.

1788
01:31:08.64 --> 01:31:12.64
And so were you replacing somebody, did somebody go home to somebody at her?

1789
01:31:12.64 --> 01:31:15.64
So they were basically alone as an ODA.

1790
01:31:15.64 --> 01:31:19.64
And this is, you know, the early days of, this was a pick province.

1791
01:31:19.64 --> 01:31:21.64
So provincial Iraqi control.

1792
01:31:21.64 --> 01:31:24.64
Basically what that meant, and you talked a lot about this in extreme ownership,

1793
01:31:24.64 --> 01:31:26.64
was you couldn't go out without the Iraqis.

1794
01:31:26.64 --> 01:31:29.64
The Iraqis had final say, the governor of, of the province,

1795
01:31:29.64 --> 01:31:32.64
determined the missions that would go out.

1796
01:31:32.64 --> 01:31:36.64
And so there was this one ODA there, and the regular army that was station there was,

1797
01:31:36.64 --> 01:31:41.64
was not infantry or they just didn't have a proves to go out at all.

1798
01:31:41.64 --> 01:31:44.64
And we were working with the local police force there.

1799
01:31:44.64 --> 01:31:48.64
So this by with and through mission that was, that's, that's what,

1800
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:51.64
that's what special forces is all about, right?

1801
01:31:51.64 --> 01:31:55.64
It's working with local indigenous forces to achieve a greater desired

1802
01:31:55.64 --> 01:31:56.64
in state.

1803
01:31:56.64 --> 01:31:57.64
And so that was our mission.

1804
01:31:57.64 --> 01:32:02.64
We were working there and there, it was, it was not busy until it was.

1805
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:06.64
But I got sent there because they didn't have the ability to call in

1806
01:32:06.64 --> 01:32:09.64
bombs if they would go out on a mission.

1807
01:32:09.64 --> 01:32:13.64
So I had this designated school that I thought it was a horrible

1808
01:32:13.64 --> 01:32:16.64
fate to get sent to the B team when I first showed up at

1809
01:32:16.64 --> 01:32:21.64
a group at Carson because you know, you can't be Jason born on the B team, right?

1810
01:32:21.64 --> 01:32:24.64
You got to be on the A team guys.

1811
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:27.64
And so that's another boat that he go, but what do you do?

1812
01:32:27.64 --> 01:32:31.64
You suck it up and you do the best job that you can and you learn how to get

1813
01:32:31.64 --> 01:32:34.64
you got to build trust the guys around you.

1814
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:37.64
So sometimes that means you do a really good job of cleaning,

1815
01:32:37.64 --> 01:32:38.64
mop in the floors.

1816
01:32:38.64 --> 01:32:40.64
You do a really good job of staying in shape.

1817
01:32:40.64 --> 01:32:42.64
You control what you can control.

1818
01:32:42.64 --> 01:32:45.64
And people will eventually take notice of that.

1819
01:32:45.64 --> 01:32:48.64
And they'll say, hey, we want to give you more responsibility.

1820
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:51.64
So anyway, I'd been sent to this school and had this

1821
01:32:51.64 --> 01:32:55.64
designator and got sent to a team in in Nassaria.

1822
01:32:55.64 --> 01:32:57.64
And that's why I got sent out there.

1823
01:32:57.64 --> 01:33:01.64
So the guys in Nassaria, you guys are living in like a little tiny

1824
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:02.64
fog of some kind.

1825
01:33:02.64 --> 01:33:07.64
So we had rotated back and we were in a bunker on base.

1826
01:33:07.64 --> 01:33:10.64
And this was one of those instances where is it?

1827
01:33:10.64 --> 01:33:12.64
And I rackied controlled base or was it American control?

1828
01:33:12.64 --> 01:33:13.64
No, it was American control base.

1829
01:33:13.64 --> 01:33:18.64
So large, you know, large runway, stuff like that for supplies and

1830
01:33:18.64 --> 01:33:20.64
you see what 30s will land there to take your pick.

1831
01:33:20.64 --> 01:33:21.64
There was a hole.

1832
01:33:21.64 --> 01:33:25.64
We were just a 30 minute car ride or truck ride, you know,

1833
01:33:25.64 --> 01:33:29.64
the Hylix is around the whole airfield and stuff.

1834
01:33:29.64 --> 01:33:32.64
And but that was all there's a big American presence there.

1835
01:33:32.64 --> 01:33:33.64
Yes.

1836
01:33:33.64 --> 01:33:37.64
And then you guys were embedded inside the wire with those guys.

1837
01:33:37.64 --> 01:33:39.64
Were there Iraqi troops?

1838
01:33:39.64 --> 01:33:40.64
Were there Iraqi police in there?

1839
01:33:40.64 --> 01:33:42.64
Two or were they in another base?

1840
01:33:42.64 --> 01:33:44.64
They had their own compound in town.

1841
01:33:44.64 --> 01:33:46.64
And this is one of those things.

1842
01:33:46.64 --> 01:33:49.64
It was kind of a coming of age story so they thought, right?

1843
01:33:49.64 --> 01:33:53.64
You know, okay, this is now a pick province and the team before us had lived with

1844
01:33:53.64 --> 01:33:56.64
them and amongst them, but we don't need you guys anymore.

1845
01:33:56.64 --> 01:33:57.64
Go back to your base.

1846
01:33:57.64 --> 01:33:58.64
Well, we got this.

1847
01:33:58.64 --> 01:34:00.64
We're good to go.

1848
01:34:00.64 --> 01:34:01.64
And check.

1849
01:34:01.64 --> 01:34:02.64
Yeah.

1850
01:34:02.64 --> 01:34:06.64
And it just, it's one of those things where then they wanted cash and and

1851
01:34:06.64 --> 01:34:07.64
guns, right?

1852
01:34:07.64 --> 01:34:10.64
We need cash and guns in order to provide security in the town.

1853
01:34:10.64 --> 01:34:16.64
And we were just, you know, paying them and we were giving them training, which was just sort of part of the deal.

1854
01:34:16.64 --> 01:34:20.64
And train them on basic tactics and all of that stuff.

1855
01:34:20.64 --> 01:34:23.64
And that was our, you know, we were just doing that.

1856
01:34:23.64 --> 01:34:28.64
Did you guys do what are they doing raids or anything where they trying to capture bad guys?

1857
01:34:28.64 --> 01:34:29.64
Yeah.

1858
01:34:29.64 --> 01:34:35.64
So to get to the sort of crux of this, you know, it was, it was quiet until it wasn't.

1859
01:34:35.64 --> 01:34:38.64
And, you know, when you go to war, you want to be in war.

1860
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:39.64
It's one of those things.

1861
01:34:39.64 --> 01:34:42.64
Be careful with what you whisk, what you wish for.

1862
01:34:42.64 --> 01:34:44.64
But you want to prove your metal.

1863
01:34:44.64 --> 01:34:50.64
I mean, it's just inherent in anybody, especially when you go through the type of training that you go through in that community.

1864
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:55.64
You're, you've either been to war and seen real combat or you haven't.

1865
01:34:55.64 --> 01:35:02.64
And, and, you know, to really earn the respect of the guys around you, you need to, you need to do that.

1866
01:35:02.64 --> 01:35:04.64
And so we wanted to do that.

1867
01:35:04.64 --> 01:35:05.64
I mean, I was new.

1868
01:35:05.64 --> 01:35:06.64
And I was new.

1869
01:35:06.64 --> 01:35:10.64
Some other guys had kind of been there done that, but they were comfortable in this environment.

1870
01:35:10.64 --> 01:35:14.64
They viewed it as making a difference, getting out and doing stuff in town.

1871
01:35:14.64 --> 01:35:20.64
So there was, there was this one morning I'd woken up from radio watch, which, you know,

1872
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:25.64
you always have someone on radio watch 24, seven around the clock, the team rotates through.

1873
01:35:25.64 --> 01:35:33.64
And it was, we got an intel, or sorry, the, our local police force called us and said there had been, you know,

1874
01:35:33.64 --> 01:35:43.64
and attack and they tried to assassinate the they, right, had tried to assassinate the, the police chief in town who were training his troops.

1875
01:35:43.64 --> 01:35:46.64
He was the colonel and were training all his troops.

1876
01:35:46.64 --> 01:35:54.64
And what it turned out to be, you know, and, and, oh, by the way, we need you to come and help us, right, because now they need us, right.

1877
01:35:54.64 --> 01:35:57.64
Their, their guys are pinned down, bunch of them got killed.

1878
01:35:57.64 --> 01:36:01.64
They're, they're in a hospital in the middle town and, and chaos, just chaos, right.

1879
01:36:01.64 --> 01:36:08.64
You know, you start to activate the intelligence networks that, you know, other guys on our team had been developing throughout that time.

1880
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:18.64
And, you know, the intel that we got, of course, later was that Macadal Sauder, Mookie had sent down whatever 1500 troops to assassinate the local police chief and,

1881
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:25.64
rain chaos down on that part of town, Institute, whatever he wanted to do to destabilize the region.

1882
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:29.64
And so, our job was to, to make sure that it would stay stable.

1883
01:36:29.64 --> 01:36:32.64
I mean, you don't want to give up ground and war, especially not a whole city.

1884
01:36:32.64 --> 01:36:38.64
Or else you got to go back and retake it. And that's, that's really messy. You got to meet violence with violence sooner.

1885
01:36:38.64 --> 01:36:44.64
So we had to, you know, go through all these approval processes to get out and to go out into the town.

1886
01:36:44.64 --> 01:36:54.64
And, you know, with our partner force, and it just, it turned into a, it was a very wild, wild west type of.

1887
01:36:54.64 --> 01:36:57.64
So did you guys push right into the hospital where they were located?

1888
01:36:57.64 --> 01:37:03.64
Well, you know, the crazy part was the bureaucracy was still just rearing and fooled swing.

1889
01:37:03.64 --> 01:37:11.64
I mean, we had to get the governor of this province to sign something that would let us go outside.

1890
01:37:11.64 --> 01:37:20.64
Like, we went out to the, the police compound and then had to come back in order to get this, this signature or whatever.

1891
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:25.64
And you can imagine the amount of complaining that's going on from our guys like we're losing momentum here.

1892
01:37:25.64 --> 01:37:30.64
Yeah. Right. You don't want to let more people come in and take more ground in a city.

1893
01:37:30.64 --> 01:37:35.64
And so, you know, we eventually got to go back out and we had our, our partner force there.

1894
01:37:35.64 --> 01:37:40.64
And, you know, we're just working with the, the guy who is in charge of the police colonel.

1895
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:47.64
And it was like we're pulling out a map on, on the hood of a Humvee saying, where are the bad guys?

1896
01:37:47.64 --> 01:37:52.64
Like, where are they? And then you're getting your, your trucks, your gun trucks and you line up.

1897
01:37:52.64 --> 01:38:00.64
And, you know, there's, realize the, the stakes here. There's three or four gun trucks and there's, you know, 1500 bad guys maybe.

1898
01:38:00.64 --> 01:38:03.64
And that's, that's a, not good odds, right?

1899
01:38:03.64 --> 01:38:04.64
That's a rough one.

1900
01:38:04.64 --> 01:38:07.64
Now, that was the Intel report.

1901
01:38:07.64 --> 01:38:13.64
And of course, you know, the, the headquarters is scrambling to get us any type of support that we needed.

1902
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:16.64
And, you know, what we needed was obviously air support.

1903
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:21.64
And so, that was my role on our team was to ensure that we had cover from above from the air force.

1904
01:38:21.64 --> 01:38:24.64
What time of day was was this during the daytime this was happening?

1905
01:38:24.64 --> 01:38:27.64
So it started in, in the morning. This kind of spin up.

1906
01:38:27.64 --> 01:38:32.64
And then we, yeah, so, well, I kept going as the radio flash.

1907
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:35.64
So it just sort of extended through.

1908
01:38:35.64 --> 01:38:42.64
And, and, and so then by the time it really started to, to pick up by the time we got to the hospital with our,

1909
01:38:42.64 --> 01:38:47.64
or with our, or rackies, and, you know, we got our Humbies and they got their pickup trucks and there's, you know,

1910
01:38:47.64 --> 01:38:51.64
It's, how many Humbies would you guys have in a 12-man team?

1911
01:38:51.64 --> 01:38:54.64
I think we had three maybe four because, yeah, three or four.

1912
01:38:54.64 --> 01:38:56.64
And then it's a little bit of a rackies in the back as well.

1913
01:38:56.64 --> 01:38:58.64
So they had their own pickup trucks.

1914
01:38:58.64 --> 01:39:02.64
Really? And so they're, you know, they're riding around in their pickup trucks and they got you saw.

1915
01:39:02.64 --> 01:39:03.64
You saw the looks on.

1916
01:39:03.64 --> 01:39:08.64
Yeah, exactly. And they got their saw mounted in the back and, you know, their windows are down.

1917
01:39:08.64 --> 01:39:14.64
Yeah. Oh, that's stuff. And, you know, at that time it's, and it still is, but the IEDs were just,

1918
01:39:14.64 --> 01:39:18.64
that was, I mean, it's the same destabilizing battlefield forces as a sniper.

1919
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:20.64
It's just such an unknown thing.

1920
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:23.64
You can do absolutely everything right and you will just still die.

1921
01:39:23.64 --> 01:39:24.64
Yeah.

1922
01:39:24.64 --> 01:39:27.64
That's, that's just the reality that you face.

1923
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:33.64
And so at some point, you know, in this process, everybody has to say, you know, I, I might die.

1924
01:39:33.64 --> 01:39:39.64
I am absolutely 100% mortal. I've seen that this is, this is very much a contact sport.

1925
01:39:39.64 --> 01:39:42.64
Other guys playing it have died in this contact sport.

1926
01:39:42.64 --> 01:39:45.64
And you have to just remove that from your brain.

1927
01:39:45.64 --> 01:39:47.64
And you have to go do your job.

1928
01:39:47.64 --> 01:39:52.64
And you have to be smart and calculating about the risks that you're willing to take.

1929
01:39:52.64 --> 01:40:02.64
Because there's this perception and I certainly had it that green berets and seals and all these types are just out there taking all of these crazy risks

1930
01:40:02.64 --> 01:40:04.64
to take on these crazy missions.

1931
01:40:04.64 --> 01:40:06.64
And that's just patently false.

1932
01:40:06.64 --> 01:40:17.64
There is so much risk mitigation both through training and planning and just the amount of time that you spend working with each other to learn tactics and techniques and procedures.

1933
01:40:17.64 --> 01:40:21.64
In order to reduce risk to achieve the mission.

1934
01:40:21.64 --> 01:40:29.64
And it's, it's, it's a, it's a lot different than what I had expected and it's a lot more effective.

1935
01:40:29.64 --> 01:40:38.64
Yeah, and until your earlier point, you can mitigate that risk. You can train. You can plan. You can do everything possible.

1936
01:40:38.64 --> 01:40:43.64
But you can't mitigate all the risk and you can just roll down the street and you guys, you can have a vehicle.

1937
01:40:43.64 --> 01:40:46.64
Good hit with an ID and everyone in that home, you can be dead.

1938
01:40:46.64 --> 01:40:48.64
And that's what can happen.

1939
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:50.64
War is just a metaphor for life, right?

1940
01:40:50.64 --> 01:40:53.64
War business love and life are all the same thing to me.

1941
01:40:53.64 --> 01:40:58.64
If you, if you don't risk anything, you will not gain anything.

1942
01:40:58.64 --> 01:41:03.64
No risk, no reward. If you're not willing to quit some job you hate.

1943
01:41:03.64 --> 01:41:09.64
If you're not willing to tell the girl that you love, that you love her and ask her on a date, Romeo, right?

1944
01:41:09.64 --> 01:41:14.64
If you're not willing to go after what you want most in life, you're not going to get it.

1945
01:41:14.64 --> 01:41:17.64
There's risk involved with that of, of what?

1946
01:41:17.64 --> 01:41:23.64
Failure humiliation. None of those is as bad as, as regret.

1947
01:41:23.64 --> 01:41:32.64
And we have regrets when we don't risk anything. So make sure that the mission and the purpose is worth the risk and do everything you can to mitigate the risk and then do everything you have.

1948
01:41:32.64 --> 01:41:35.64
There's a lot worse things than dying.

1949
01:41:35.64 --> 01:41:37.64
So you guys made it to the hospital?

1950
01:41:37.64 --> 01:41:39.64
So we got to the hospital.

1951
01:41:39.64 --> 01:41:44.64
You know, we recovered. There's a lot of wounded guys that were pinned up there.

1952
01:41:44.64 --> 01:41:49.64
They're loading them into the back of the, back of the pickup trucks and it's dark out.

1953
01:41:49.64 --> 01:41:55.64
And there's, you know, I'm scanning because my basic only job.

1954
01:41:55.64 --> 01:41:59.64
Really, is this is my second mission out?

1955
01:41:59.64 --> 01:42:07.64
I mean, it's first mission out. I mean, there's sort of some pseudo missions, but we didn't do sort of recon by fires.

1956
01:42:07.64 --> 01:42:17.64
Like you talked about with, you know, when you had your, your guy has first showed up in Ramadi and he had this really complex plan to drive all over town and you said, hey, how about you go?

1957
01:42:17.64 --> 01:42:18.64
Yeah.

1958
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:21.64
600 meters out and 600 meters back or whatever.

1959
01:42:21.64 --> 01:42:27.64
We would do that stuff, but we just weren't getting shot up. So this is my first real mission of any kind.

1960
01:42:27.64 --> 01:42:28.64
Right.

1961
01:42:28.64 --> 01:42:39.64
And it was just, you know, it was one of those things where my only job was to focus on the aircraft.

1962
01:42:39.64 --> 01:42:43.64
I don't know anything about conducting wartime operations yet.

1963
01:42:43.64 --> 01:42:44.64
Nothing.

1964
01:42:44.64 --> 01:42:48.64
I'm going to do my first real mission. So I just had to focus on the task at hand.

1965
01:42:48.64 --> 01:42:58.64
And my job for our team in order for me to not let our team aids down was to do everything I could to trust in the training that I had.

1966
01:42:58.64 --> 01:43:03.64
And, and make sure that the aircraft was doing everything that they could do to support us.

1967
01:43:03.64 --> 01:43:06.64
Because they have a great vantage point of their, they can see lots of stuff.

1968
01:43:06.64 --> 01:43:10.64
And if you've ever had a, you know, hammer was the call sign, the AC 130 gunship.

1969
01:43:10.64 --> 01:43:16.64
I mean, that is just, I mean, that as a battlefield asset is unrivaled.

1970
01:43:16.64 --> 01:43:18.64
It's unrivaled.

1971
01:43:18.64 --> 01:43:20.64
It is unbelievable.

1972
01:43:20.64 --> 01:43:20.64
Yes.

1973
01:43:20.64 --> 01:43:22.64
What's the key to the AC 130?

1974
01:43:22.64 --> 01:43:24.64
I mean, God bless the Air Force.

1975
01:43:24.64 --> 01:43:25.64
Literally.

1976
01:43:25.64 --> 01:43:29.64
I mean, it is just a vital support role that they play.

1977
01:43:29.64 --> 01:43:35.64
I mean, you know, there's this idea of, you want this kind of fair fight in life.

1978
01:43:35.64 --> 01:43:36.64
It's more.

1979
01:43:36.64 --> 01:43:37.64
No, you don't want that.

1980
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:38.64
I want an AC 130.

1981
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:38.64
Yes.

1982
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:39.64
That's it.

1983
01:43:39.64 --> 01:43:41.64
I want the most unfair fight possible.

1984
01:43:41.64 --> 01:43:42.64
Yes.

1985
01:43:42.64 --> 01:43:44.64
And so, you know, they don't play by the rules.

1986
01:43:44.64 --> 01:43:47.64
The enemy doesn't mean the rules are win when you get into combat.

1987
01:43:47.64 --> 01:43:48.64
I mean, there's a reason.

1988
01:43:48.64 --> 01:43:50.64
All's fair and love and war, right?

1989
01:43:50.64 --> 01:43:51.64
All's fair and war.

1990
01:43:51.64 --> 01:43:53.64
There's those such thing as unfair.

1991
01:43:53.64 --> 01:43:55.64
So I want, I want a gunship.

1992
01:43:55.64 --> 01:43:57.64
So you guys had an AC 130?

1993
01:43:57.64 --> 01:43:59.64
We had an AC, we had a huge stack.

1994
01:43:59.64 --> 01:44:00.64
Nice.

1995
01:44:00.64 --> 01:44:04.64
I mean, so you're basically stacking all sorts of different aircraft at different levels.

1996
01:44:04.64 --> 01:44:07.64
Did it turn out that there was this many enemy fighters head in your way?

1997
01:44:07.64 --> 01:44:11.64
Was it 1500 or was it like 40?

1998
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:19.64
So we'll never fully know what we do know is that the first building, we started taking contact

1999
01:44:19.64 --> 01:44:20.64
as we were moving.

2000
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:27.64
And the local fighters, we don't, we assumed that they did not think that there was Americans here,

2001
01:44:27.64 --> 01:44:30.64
right, in this section of whoops.

2002
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:32.64
Where are they were whoops is right?

2003
01:44:32.64 --> 01:44:36.64
Because, you know, the Iraqis also had humvies that we had given them.

2004
01:44:36.64 --> 01:44:37.64
And we're not here.

2005
01:44:37.64 --> 01:44:42.64
I mean, like my favorite color is red, white and blue together in the American flag.

2006
01:44:42.64 --> 01:44:43.64
That's my all time favorite color.

2007
01:44:43.64 --> 01:44:48.64
But when we go to war, we're not going to go fly that proudly on the back of our homvies and say,

2008
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:50.64
hey, the Americans are here, right?

2009
01:44:50.64 --> 01:44:54.64
We're going to wait until you shoot at us from behind and in front.

2010
01:44:54.64 --> 01:44:58.64
And then that big building where there was lots of barrel fire, that's going to go away.

2011
01:44:58.64 --> 01:44:59.64
Right?

2012
01:44:59.64 --> 01:45:01.64
Or it's going to have, it's going to look like Swiss cheese at the end of it.

2013
01:45:01.64 --> 01:45:07.64
And this was not one of those very complicated war times situations.

2014
01:45:07.64 --> 01:45:13.64
I mean, we were there to support our partner force to provide security in this,

2015
01:45:13.64 --> 01:45:15.64
in this part of the world.

2016
01:45:15.64 --> 01:45:20.64
And, you know, they had been shot up by outside force.

2017
01:45:20.64 --> 01:45:26.64
And we were there to provide stability when we're getting shot at with them with us.

2018
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:30.64
Like that's obviously an enemy trying to kill us and our job is to kill you.

2019
01:45:30.64 --> 01:45:32.64
And that's basically what it was.

2020
01:45:32.64 --> 01:45:43.64
But it was, you know, a lot of rounds the city where we would go back to the back of his base and put the map back on the trunk of the homvie.

2021
01:45:43.64 --> 01:45:45.64
And I would say, where are the bad guys?

2022
01:45:45.64 --> 01:45:53.64
Well, it's amazing what kind of intel you can get from a source when you're going to help them go do something that they need you to do, right?

2023
01:45:53.64 --> 01:45:57.64
They won't know anything until something like this happens.

2024
01:45:57.64 --> 01:46:05.64
And so, you know, my job was to basically sit there and call the coordinates up to some of the fast movers or some of the jets.

2025
01:46:05.64 --> 01:46:11.64
And they would go recon that part of town and they would say, nope, no activity there.

2026
01:46:11.64 --> 01:46:14.64
What's the next coordinate you want me to go check out?

2027
01:46:14.64 --> 01:46:18.64
And then, you know, they would say, okay, we'll go check out this coordinate point on the map and I'd send that up and be like,

2028
01:46:18.64 --> 01:46:20.64
Yeah, there's a war party there.

2029
01:46:20.64 --> 01:46:24.64
And so, then we go drive over to that war party and that's how the night went.

2030
01:46:24.64 --> 01:46:36.64
There was a lot of loops around the city and then, you know, you pull back into base and you got that, that chemical dump and you're just sort of, you see out there,

2031
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:41.64
how guys can go on these missions and then just fall asleep.

2032
01:46:41.64 --> 01:46:44.64
It's not because you're just so physically tired.

2033
01:46:44.64 --> 01:46:47.64
I mean, it's part of it, maybe.

2034
01:46:47.64 --> 01:47:00.64
But there's just this huge kind of, okay, we're back on base or we're back wherever and you can just fall asleep so quickly because your body is allowed to relax,

2035
01:47:00.64 --> 01:47:03.64
of sorts, you feel safe again, right?

2036
01:47:03.64 --> 01:47:07.64
And, but we come back and, you know, then it's right back to the priorities of work.

2037
01:47:07.64 --> 01:47:12.64
You've got to gas up the trucks because you're going back out, by the way, because it's not like one night,

2038
01:47:12.64 --> 01:47:17.64
you just, the multi-headed hydra is just dead now. That's not how it works.

2039
01:47:17.64 --> 01:47:25.64
But, you know, our headquarters element had sent all sorts of other atains and, you know, the Iraqi commandos were there.

2040
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:34.64
And then it was for the week, the next week, it was just a lot of actioning all sorts of new intel that came in and, and, and,

2041
01:47:34.64 --> 01:47:40.64
yeah, it ended up not being some sort of martial law type situation that we were fighting,

2042
01:47:40.64 --> 01:47:46.64
but it's also kind of a doctrine-based thing where if you meet violence with violence and speed of action,

2043
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:53.64
you can, you can take back the high ground or take back the town itself.

2044
01:47:53.64 --> 01:48:03.64
And so that's, you know, who knows? Who knows what would have happened if they, the, the, the insurgents would have been more successful and would have taken over the police compound and would have done these various things,

2045
01:48:03.64 --> 01:48:04.64
who knows?

2046
01:48:04.64 --> 01:48:13.64
Yeah, then you got to fight to take the, the ground back. Yeah, well, they would have taken over the compound, the vehicles, the weapons, that stuff gets really scary, really quick.

2047
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:14.64
Yeah.

2048
01:48:14.64 --> 01:48:19.64
So then, so then you guys got the city back under control. This was Nasiria, you said, right?

2049
01:48:19.64 --> 01:48:21.64
Nasiria. Yeah.

2050
01:48:21.64 --> 01:48:25.64
And then once you had it back under control, did things kind of settle down?

2051
01:48:25.64 --> 01:48:38.64
They did what the, the interesting part was that this is how we had developed rapport with our partner force, right? So when you do hard things with people and you do them well,

2052
01:48:38.64 --> 01:48:42.64
and you build trust with them, then they want to work with you.

2053
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:50.64
And that, that cuts across all different lines, right? So whether it's Navy workin with Army and Marine Corps or whether it's, you know,

2054
01:48:50.64 --> 01:49:01.64
us working with the Iraqis and working with the Australians that were on base at that time as well. And they were, they were great in support of the mission that we were there as well.

2055
01:49:01.64 --> 01:49:10.64
And when you do hard things, you just develop a bond with people and that's foundational in the military.

2056
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:27.64
And, and so we found that we were much more effective training them. We were much more, they were much more receptive to the intelligence gathering in their town and just working with us in general.

2057
01:49:27.64 --> 01:49:38.64
And so then we could go on patrols with them or go on missions with them in their town, going after the stuff that they wanted to go after.

2058
01:49:38.64 --> 01:49:45.64
You know, and that was effective because we, we were better at the tactics, but they were better.

2059
01:49:45.64 --> 01:49:51.64
They were better as the first guys in the door. They, they speak the local, they have, they know all the local stuff.

2060
01:49:51.64 --> 01:49:56.64
We, we always found it funny like early on in our deployment to a body like our breaches would go up to a door.

2061
01:49:56.64 --> 01:50:00.64
And of course they look at the door. Oh, it's okay. We can't open it, cool, it's a red jammer.

2062
01:50:00.64 --> 01:50:10.64
But sometimes they would just have like these little Iraqi mechanisms. And like on our raccades walk up and like push a switch or whatever pull lever and the thing would open up.

2063
01:50:10.64 --> 01:50:18.64
We were like, okay, cool. And, and also like you just said, they could easily identify if this person was from Ramadi.

2064
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:22.64
And if they weren't from Ramadi and they were living in a house, they were probably a foreign fighter and probably bad.

2065
01:50:22.64 --> 01:50:32.64
So, but we can't tell the difference anymore than someone from Iraq could come here and tell the difference between someone from New Jersey and someone from Boston and someone from Alabama.

2066
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:37.64
Like even if even if you speak the language, you don't understand those kind of dialects.

2067
01:50:37.64 --> 01:50:45.64
And so whereas Iraqi people, Iraqi soldiers, they'd walk in the back of all this guys from not from here. He's, you know, I always use the example of what you have for breakfast.

2068
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:56.64
Because they knew, you know, if you ask what you have for breakfast in South Carolina, you get a different answer than when you say, what did you have for breakfast in in Maine, right?

2069
01:50:56.64 --> 01:51:05.64
Different things in California like out here, it's like, oh, I had a breakfast burrito. If you ask someone from Maine, what they have for breakfast, they're not going to say breakfast burritos not happening.

2070
01:51:05.64 --> 01:51:13.64
So yeah, they can they can identify those things. So did you guys end up doing like just for the rest of the polymer, you guys do in just like targeted raids to go and get rid of bad guys.

2071
01:51:13.64 --> 01:51:28.64
So ours was kind of the full scale all encompassing special forces mission. This was not some hugely kinetic driven operation. We didn't have the commandos. That was a good mission to get. That was not what our team had, right?

2072
01:51:28.64 --> 01:51:33.64
So the commandos were a national level Iraqi person. You would assign one.

2073
01:51:33.64 --> 01:51:35.64
So you guys, was your partner force was a police force?

2074
01:51:35.64 --> 01:51:42.64
Our partner force was a police force and over there, I mean, what's the difference between soldiers and police, you know, very little.

2075
01:51:42.64 --> 01:51:50.64
I mean, in a lot of ways. Yeah, they carry around machine guns. They, you know, it's the difference is one where it's like a blue shirt.

2076
01:51:50.64 --> 01:51:55.64
Exactly. And the other ones don't, that was where I can't be top. That's kind of the difference.

2077
01:51:55.64 --> 01:52:01.64
Yep. And so, you know, we were we were training them up. Was your Iraqi police force from?

2078
01:52:01.64 --> 01:52:14.64
No, Zaria. They were. See, that's another, that is another big difference. Is that the local police forces are generally from that local area, which gives them even more of a sense of what's going on, which is important.

2079
01:52:14.64 --> 01:52:24.64
Whereas, you know, in Romadi, the soldiers, the army soldiers were coming in from, you know, all over the country coming in from Baghdad, also vastly shea.

2080
01:52:24.64 --> 01:52:32.64
And so now you got them coming into, you know, SUNY homes inside Romadi. So there was a little riff there, whereas the police were from Romadi.

2081
01:52:32.64 --> 01:52:46.64
And they were SUNY's. And so they did, they immediately almost have a better relationship. Once we built up that police force. And when I say we, I'm definitely not talking about us just as seals. In fact, I'm talking about everyone else that did more, much more of that than we did.

2082
01:52:46.64 --> 01:52:57.64
But so you guys were more doing this full spectrum to you guys are training them, you guys are teaching them how to gather intel, you're teaching them how to do simple things like logistics and all this kind of thing.

2083
01:52:57.64 --> 01:53:06.64
We're also running our own, and there's a guy on the team whose his job, he's the intelligence sergeant, and he's running, you know, assets and all that stuff in the town.

2084
01:53:06.64 --> 01:53:22.64
So you know, it's the buy with and through mission. So we're gathering intel and town through random sources, not random, but various sources. And then what you try to do is you try to train your force up by doing stuff, right? You don't just, oh JT.

2085
01:53:22.64 --> 01:53:35.64
On the job training exactly, you don't just gather all your intel and just keep it to yourself. You need to get your force out doing stuff that they can gain confidence from doing stuff in life. That's how this works.

2086
01:53:35.64 --> 01:53:50.64
And so it just sort of turned into, hey, you know, here's some, here's some intel on this, and then we would go out with them and they're the first in, because that's what you want. I mean, you said and think, unless you've got some really high value target,

2087
01:53:50.64 --> 01:54:05.64
you're going to send in your own very best guys, because failure is not an option. I mean, been lawdon raid is, of course, a good example. You're going to send in the people, you're not going to let your partner force go in first.

2088
01:54:05.64 --> 01:54:33.64
You're going to take care of that. You're not even going to tell your partner force exactly. And you're willing to live with those consequences because it's that important. In this case, you know, this was part of the coin strategy, the counter insurgency, right? You need these local trained up police forces to go out and be able to police their own areas. And it's less sexy in some ways than, hey, I got my beard and I got my guns and we're going to go after bad guys in every single night.

2089
01:54:33.64 --> 01:55:01.64
But it's a lot more effective, train the trainer. And so our job is to go out there and basically show them how to do this. And this is how you, here's the tactics and this is what we do. And so they're the first in and you know, you get good. If you're a cop or you're a soldier, it's kind of the same thing. There's that's why there's such a bond even in America between cops and soldiers, you go into a house, you can smell what that house smells like.

2090
01:55:01.64 --> 01:55:29.64
And if the hair on the back of your neck stands up, it's probably not good. And you can walk into some house and you're like, nope, I can just tell this isn't it. Well, their sense of smell, quote, quote, is a lot better than ours. And ours is pretty good at times, but they're able to go into a house. And you know, by the way, the doorways are really narrow. There's 25 people sleeping on the floor. You know, half the time they're on the rooftop naturally because it's cooler because it's a hot country, right?

2091
01:55:29.64 --> 01:55:41.64
How are you kind of assessing, you got everyone's got a rooftop. So if you're dealing with aircraft above, who's on the rooftop, it's not like they're up there as snipers all the time. They're just on the rooftop.

2092
01:55:41.64 --> 01:55:53.64
They're sleeping. They're sleeping. Yeah, with their kids. And so it doesn't work to go into these places with your, you know, just guns and do more than you should.

2093
01:55:53.64 --> 01:56:00.64
And so, you know, part of what going through elite style of training brings is the confidence to know when not to pull the trigger.

2094
01:56:00.64 --> 01:56:08.64
Went to a soon greater risk to your own life because you should not just go out and pull the trigger.

2095
01:56:08.64 --> 01:56:22.64
And the more confidence you have in your weapons in your sense, and that's really important. And it's a much more stabilizing presence there if you don't kill a bunch of innocent people, right?

2096
01:56:22.64 --> 01:56:37.64
There is collateral damage in war. It's just, it happens. But you have to do almost everything that you can to minimize that because the second, third order effects of dead women and children are not good.

2097
01:56:37.64 --> 01:56:46.64
Yeah, that's the US military goes through incredible lengths. We're rent that from happening. And, you know, and you're an environment that this is a good example.

2098
01:56:46.64 --> 01:56:59.64
You know, nausea at that time. This is a good example. It's like a transitional phase. And I mean, when the Marine Corps pushed into nausea, you know, three, it was, you know, like a legitimate war battle going on.

2099
01:56:59.64 --> 01:57:12.64
And now you fast forward four years. It's a different situation. It needs to be handled with more discrepancy. So, so that's, yeah, that's the way it works out, which is the way it's supposed to work out. That's what counter insurgency is.

2100
01:57:12.64 --> 01:57:27.64
The level of violence gets less and less over time. And hopefully, we'll hopefully it does. And then also hopefully the capabilities of the host nation forces get better and better.

2101
01:57:27.64 --> 01:57:32.64
And eventually they reach your point where we're not needed anymore. That's what's supposed to happen.

2102
01:57:32.64 --> 01:57:36.64
That's what's supposed to happen. You know, it's what year is it? We're 18 years later.

2103
01:57:36.64 --> 01:57:48.64
Well, I mean, we made some, you know, we got Iraq to a fairly stable position. And unfortunately, we completely left. And situations like what you just talked about, that's a classic situation where it's like all of a sudden, whoa.

2104
01:57:48.64 --> 01:58:02.64
We're about to, you know, we've got a real problem here. And when we left, there's no one to call. When we're still there, we go, okay, cool. Because what we just said is, hey, if soldiers troops had come in and taking the police building down and gotten those weapons and gotten those vehicles.

2105
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:12.64
And now they're going to start to empower themselves over the people inside that city. That's where that's where you have a real problem. That's kind of what happened with ISIS after we pulled out of Iraq.

2106
01:58:12.64 --> 01:58:18.64
So, yeah, that's what's supposed to happen. But you have to continue to provide support to that host nation.

2107
01:58:18.64 --> 01:58:27.64
Because even once you mitigate the levels of violence as much as you can, you need to make sure that they're gone. And that takes a long time.

2108
01:58:27.64 --> 01:58:36.64
That could take 10 years. It could take 15 years. We're still in Germany. You know, we're, we're, we're in Japan for a really, really long time.

2109
01:58:36.64 --> 01:58:46.64
And so these things can take a long time. And they shouldn't be, you know, if we were to stay in Iraq in, after 2010, if we were to be there in 2012, 2013, 2014.

2110
01:58:46.64 --> 01:58:53.64
If we were to just stay there, I bet those guys, I mean, even lay for wrote extreme ownership with me. And he went in 2010.

2111
01:58:53.64 --> 01:59:06.64
And in all of Al-Al-Al-Bar Province, when he deployed with Sealtime 1 in 2010, in all of Al-Al-Al-Al-Bar Province for his six-month appointment, there was one friendly casualty.

2112
01:59:06.64 --> 01:59:19.64
And it was from a vehicle roll over. And you compare that to when he and I were there in 2006, when there was a casualty or two or three or four or five every single day, just in the city of Ramadi.

2113
01:59:19.64 --> 01:59:31.64
So we were heading in the right direction. I mean, that's a massive switch. But again, if you assume that, okay, well, it's good enough. And now we can just walk away.

2114
01:59:31.64 --> 01:59:36.64
That might not be the best policy. So you need to think through those things a little bit better than we do.

2115
01:59:36.64 --> 01:59:45.64
I think some of those decisions were made based on political decisions based, instead of based on, you know, everybody that was on the ground that was saying,

2116
01:59:45.64 --> 01:59:58.64
we're not quite ready to leave yet. Need to give a little more time. Need to stay, keep our presence here, be a backup force, you know, be able to support the local Iraqi soldiers and police if they need it, which they probably won't.

2117
01:59:58.64 --> 02:00:03.64
I mean, they already said, hey, we don't need you guys. That was 2007. They said, hey, we don't need you guys living on a anymore.

2118
02:00:03.64 --> 02:00:14.64
That's cool. And Ramadi, they weren't saying that. They wanted us there. And every time we turned over a police station to them, I think, I think every single time that we turned over completely a police station to them.

2119
02:00:14.64 --> 02:00:29.64
In 2006, it got overrun. So they weren't ready for that yet. So it's going to take more time. Eventually, in 2007, 2008, they turned over all those. And there was no more coalition forces outside in the city. It was all Iraqis.

2120
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:41.64
So we can get there, but a counter insurgency takes time. And you have to, you have to give it time. You're not on, you know, it's kind of like kind of like standing on the dang cables at airborne school.

2121
02:00:41.64 --> 02:00:46.64
This is, you're, you can have to do it. You have to stay there until it's time to, until it's done. Tell us, ready.

2122
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:57.64
Yeah, that takes some time. Then you start to get into what's the expectation that people back home have for how long this should take and how much does it cost and is it really worth it?

2123
02:00:57.64 --> 02:01:08.64
And you know, I mean, it was just a really, it was just a really hard time, you know, it's, and it's also hard when you're fighting and my, my family was hugely supportive.

2124
02:01:08.64 --> 02:01:19.64
And yet, at that time, it was all about the casualty counts, the body counts of American soldiers in Iraq. And you got a lot of moms.

2125
02:01:19.64 --> 02:01:26.64
And you got a lot of moms who can really relate to the moms that are suffering from losing their children.

2126
02:01:26.64 --> 02:01:37.64
And I mean, what's the, what is the desired in state? Like, what is our actual goal? Is it, is it to turn Iraq into Germany?

2127
02:01:37.64 --> 02:01:43.64
I mean, if so, good luck, or is it, we don't want places to be able to export violence?

2128
02:01:43.64 --> 02:01:53.64
I mean, destabilize, they stabilization. I mean, I, I kind of never fully understood what the actual desired in state was that was realistic.

2129
02:01:53.64 --> 02:01:59.64
Yeah, well, America did a bad job of stating what that was and clarifying the mission and clarifying the goal.

2130
02:01:59.64 --> 02:02:09.64
And then they also have, you, you also have to be able to explain that look as we dive into a situation.

2131
02:02:09.64 --> 02:02:15.64
Our expectations are going to change. And to your point.

2132
02:02:15.64 --> 02:02:26.64
When you look at an Iraqi army unit, let's say, or Iraqi police unit, if you think that you're going to turn them into a Western military unit,

2133
02:02:26.64 --> 02:02:30.64
or a Western police force, you're not going to because they have a different culture.

2134
02:02:30.64 --> 02:02:39.64
But what you can do is figure out how an effective police force or how an effective military unit fits inside their culture.

2135
02:02:39.64 --> 02:02:43.64
And then they can, can do an excellent job. But you have to, you have to be malleable.

2136
02:02:43.64 --> 02:02:47.64
I know, like, for instance, just the way that they would gather in tell.

2137
02:02:47.64 --> 02:02:51.64
And we'd be trying to teach them how to do their intel gathering.

2138
02:02:51.64 --> 02:02:56.64
And it's like, actually let them, these people know how to talk to their own people.

2139
02:02:56.64 --> 02:03:00.64
They don't want to figure this stuff out. They know how to document it. Let them run with it.

2140
02:03:00.64 --> 02:03:10.64
And instead of trying to force our methodology on top of them, take advantage of some of the cultural advantages that they have inside their own country.

2141
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:17.64
Let's do that. So you, you have to be able to adapt as you see a situation unfold.

2142
02:03:17.64 --> 02:03:22.64
But then you have to, just like, just like as a leader when the priorities change as a leader with your team,

2143
02:03:22.64 --> 02:03:26.64
you have to explain to everybody, hey, okay, I didn't see this comment.

2144
02:03:26.64 --> 02:03:30.64
This is a little different than I thought it was going to be, a little different than we thought it was going to be.

2145
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:36.64
Here's what we're trying to make happen now. Okay, everyone says, okay, let's, let's move in that direction.

2146
02:03:36.64 --> 02:03:44.64
So I think not only does did America do a bad job of coming out of the gates and hey, hey, okay, here's what we're trying to get done right now.

2147
02:03:44.64 --> 02:03:48.64
It's also okay, look, didn't really see this coming.

2148
02:03:48.64 --> 02:03:52.64
Here's what we're going to try and get done. Here's where, here's the direction we're moving now.

2149
02:03:52.64 --> 02:03:54.64
This is what we're, this is what we're going to do.

2150
02:03:54.64 --> 02:04:08.64
And we did not do a great job of explaining that to the public because man, when I went over in 2006 and it was same way in 2007, like you're talking about the public opinion had massively.

2151
02:04:08.64 --> 02:04:26.64
Not universally, but a lot of public opinion had turned against the war. For sure, that was the TV that was, you know, an entire half of the country was, I go, we shouldn't be there. Okay, so how do we explain to people, okay, if we don't want to be there.

2152
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:34.64
What do we do to leave? What's the best way to leave? How do we get out of there? How do we get out of there in such a way that it doesn't turn into a problem again?

2153
02:04:34.64 --> 02:04:43.64
So, these are all things from a really grand strategic perspective that hopefully we can learn lessons from.

2154
02:04:43.64 --> 02:04:54.64
And you know, I'm sure you've seen some of the reports coming out of Afghanistan right now about what was being said on the ground and what was being told to America.

2155
02:04:54.64 --> 02:05:18.64
Obviously, some really stark contradictions between those two things and it's horrible to read about. You know, you can look at the entire Vietnam war and you know what the whiz kids were saying about Vietnam and about hey, all we need to do is kill more of them than they do of us and will eventually win. It's like, no, that's not actually true.

2156
02:05:18.64 --> 02:05:36.64
And you know, this is one of the reasons that, you know, I've got my kind of personal mentor who have never met before, but Colonel David Hacworth, who came out at the end of the Vietnam war and said, you know, if we don't change the way we're fighting, we're going to lose.

2157
02:05:36.64 --> 02:05:49.64
We've got Trump out of the army and no one wanted to hear that. And even even in the 90s, he was viewed by the army by some large portions of the army as sort of a trader.

2158
02:05:49.64 --> 02:05:59.64
Strong word, but they saw him as sort of a trader. Well, he was the guy that was telling the truth, he was the guy that was saying, listen, we're not doing this right. And if we keep doing this, we're not going to be able to win.

2159
02:05:59.64 --> 02:06:26.64
So these are all things that, yeah, as a nation, leadership, military and civilian communicating to each other openly and trying to work together to find solutions, trying to work together to adapt your mission to something that's achievable to something that we can do to something that's worthwhile. These are all things that we need to do a better job as a country for sure.

2160
02:06:26.64 --> 02:06:36.64
Yeah, so relating back to Vietnam and then to Iraq though, to our country's credit, and this gets nobody ever likes to say, hey, America, great job, right?

2161
02:06:36.64 --> 02:06:50.64
But when you sit and think about how far we as a nation came from Vietnam, where they would spit on soldiers when they came home, to Iraq, where half the country disagreed with our presence there in 2006, 2007, around that timeframe.

2162
02:06:50.64 --> 02:07:02.64
I mean, there was still separation between the soldiers and Marines, et cetera, and the actual support of the war. And that, you know, I felt very supported.

2163
02:07:02.64 --> 02:07:11.64
And so as far as I knew, did everyone that was there with me did as well. Just the American public was not taking its anger out on us.

2164
02:07:11.64 --> 02:07:26.64
America has definitely learned an incredible lesson from every member's perspective. That meant everything. So, you know, I cannot imagine what those soldiers went through in Vietnam when they would come back and it was just they were spit on.

2165
02:07:26.64 --> 02:07:39.64
Can you imagine? It's insane to think about. It's insane to think about. I mean, I covered a book on here. Guy came home with a severely wounded arm. You know, and he's goes to college and sure enough, he's,

2166
02:07:39.64 --> 02:07:47.64
you know, getting called a baby killer and all that and you just think to yourself, wow, that's, that's just unbelievable.

2167
02:07:47.64 --> 02:08:05.64
And then you had Jim Cersley come on here who is in Vietnam as a soldier in Vietnam, who, who, on in his 11th month of his deployment to Vietnam, stepped on an ID, lost both of his legs, like basically at the hips or most lost one of his arms.

2168
02:08:05.64 --> 02:08:16.64
And I don't know if a human being can face adversity.

2169
02:08:16.64 --> 02:08:22.64
I'll let me put it this way. If that guy is not a model of how to face adversity, I don't know who he is because he came home.

2170
02:08:22.64 --> 02:08:34.64
Did nine months of rehab, got done, left his rehab, went to college, got a job, started a roofing company, started doing real estate and carried on with the rest of his life.

2171
02:08:34.64 --> 02:08:44.64
I mean, just like the most unbelievable face to adversity and you know, we've had plenty of other guys on here that have been incredible.

2172
02:08:44.64 --> 02:08:52.64
Just the way that they face, I mean, Travis Mills, I don't know if you know Travis Mills is but, you know, he's a quadruple amputee.

2173
02:08:52.64 --> 02:09:01.64
The guy is his, his, his just unbreakable spirit. I mean, just facing adversity every single day that we can't even fathom.

2174
02:09:01.64 --> 02:09:17.64
We can't even fathom the tiny little things in his life that he has to struggle with that he wants to never say a word about and he does it and he carries on and when you meet him, you think, man, I wish I could be as happy as he is.

2175
02:09:17.64 --> 02:09:22.64
I wish I could go, I wish I could get along in life as well as he is doing right now.

2176
02:09:22.64 --> 02:09:41.64
So, a lot of that does come from the fact that America learned its lesson from Vietnam at least from the perspective that you just gave, which is, we treat our service men and women with respect, regardless of what you feel about the war.

2177
02:09:41.64 --> 02:09:50.64
Okay, got it, but we treat our service men and women with respect, which is a, which is a high praise for the way that we are operating American out for sure.

2178
02:09:50.64 --> 02:09:56.64
I think it would be great to even take that one step further and just those who serve.

2179
02:09:56.64 --> 02:10:02.64
Those who, that's the fabric of what makes America America strong communities.

2180
02:10:02.64 --> 02:10:10.64
We have aligned purpose or values are really clear, you know, as an American, as an, as America, what we stand for.

2181
02:10:10.64 --> 02:10:22.64
And yet there's a lot of people that make that happen at the local level, there's teachers, there's fire, there's cops, there's first responders, there's all sorts of people that work in.

2182
02:10:22.64 --> 02:10:30.64
Also dangerous jobs out of DC and it's just, we need a call to service.

2183
02:10:30.64 --> 02:10:45.64
In, in this culture where there's just a lot of emphasis and value placed on being the best individual, we need to reawaken those calls to where it's, it's a very noble thing to go and serve your country.

2184
02:10:45.64 --> 02:10:55.64
Yeah, and I'll tell you right now, I mean, the idea that you're going to get real satisfaction from taking care of yourself.

2185
02:10:55.64 --> 02:11:02.64
It pales in comparison to the satisfaction that you get when you help other people, no doubt about it.

2186
02:11:02.64 --> 02:11:09.64
And if people don't understand that, you know, I get asked sometimes you, well, I don't know what my next mission is, I don't know what to focus on.

2187
02:11:09.64 --> 02:11:17.64
I'm like, okay, if you don't know that, cool, go help other people go down to a damn soup kitchen and volunteer and you'll start to figure something out.

2188
02:11:17.64 --> 02:11:22.64
And if you don't, cool, you're helping other people either way, we're in a better place because of it.

2189
02:11:22.64 --> 02:11:36.64
It's kind of counterintuitive, though. It is because it's so people and I did this as well. We struggle to make that connection where we say, I've got to be better. Me, me, me.

2190
02:11:36.64 --> 02:11:40.64
Now, how do you do that is you find a mission.

2191
02:11:40.64 --> 02:11:47.64
And if, if you have a purpose and then you have a mission on top of that purpose, that's your, your hit-n-home runs.

2192
02:11:47.64 --> 02:11:59.64
Regardless of that, if you just dedicate your life to serving something greater than yourself, it just opens up a way of life that leads to a lot of great things with a lot of great people.

2193
02:11:59.64 --> 02:12:08.64
And I just, I've never met the person at the end of their days who said, you know, I was just, I served too much.

2194
02:12:08.64 --> 02:12:13.64
I gave too much to other people. I wish I had just done more for me, me, me.

2195
02:12:13.64 --> 02:12:25.64
I just haven't met that person. And so, you know, we have the ability and the potential to change our lives for the better with just a mindset shift.

2196
02:12:25.64 --> 02:12:30.64
Just to say, we dedicate yourself to a greater cause. There's lots of ways to do it.

2197
02:12:30.64 --> 02:12:37.64
The military is a very romanticized way, especially in our society.

2198
02:12:37.64 --> 02:12:47.64
So we uniquely love our military. And I do too. And there's just, it's not for everyone. And it doesn't have to be, and it shouldn't be.

2199
02:12:47.64 --> 02:12:57.64
So instead of kind of using this old, the military only affects 1% of the population, like it's some sort of judgment on our entire country.

2200
02:12:57.64 --> 02:13:02.64
That's okay. The military is 1% that's, that's awesome, right?

2201
02:13:02.64 --> 02:13:09.64
And if it needed to be more, it would be. But it's 1% that's okay. There's a lot of ways to serve.

2202
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:22.64
And that's where the bridges between the Americas that we love that represents the best America and where maybe we come up a little bit short from time to time.

2203
02:13:22.64 --> 02:13:28.64
If we just dedicate ourselves to serving instead of to being angry at the TV news at night,

2204
02:13:28.64 --> 02:13:34.64
like, go turn the TV off and go find something to serve that will benefit your community in our country.

2205
02:13:34.64 --> 02:13:45.64
Go do that. That would be helpful. Yeah. But, you know, instead, let me see how many dopamine hits I can get through my brain from the likes that I'm going to get on Facebook.

2206
02:13:45.64 --> 02:13:52.64
If I go publish some anger, written ad that's divide and conquer tactics, we're, you're just a pawn.

2207
02:13:52.64 --> 02:14:00.64
Someone's, someone's written some article that's, that's gonna just divide people and we share that stuff and people like it.

2208
02:14:00.64 --> 02:14:05.64
And we think, wow, I'm, I'm part of a community that's, that's talking about these important things.

2209
02:14:05.64 --> 02:14:13.64
How about you go, stop doing that first and how about you go do something that actually helps other people.

2210
02:14:13.64 --> 02:14:19.64
And I don't say, here saying, this is all I do with my life. I don't just, you know, go from orphanage to orphanage, right?

2211
02:14:19.64 --> 02:14:24.64
All day long, every day, right? I'm, I'm human like all of us.

2212
02:14:24.64 --> 02:14:31.64
And yet, you know, when I have these kind of, these times when I think and reflect,

2213
02:14:31.64 --> 02:14:41.64
usually outside with a ruck on, like, am I doing what I can do to make my community, my family, my community, my country stronger,

2214
02:14:41.64 --> 02:14:47.64
because I just, I feel like I owe, and that's the, the bug that I caught through, through service.

2215
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:54.64
I did not foresee that. I thought it was going to be about me and me getting my revenge for what happened over 9-11.

2216
02:14:54.64 --> 02:15:01.64
And what I got instead was this, this really basic primordial reaction that I just, I owe more.

2217
02:15:01.64 --> 02:15:05.64
And I can't shake it, and I'm grateful that I can't.

2218
02:15:05.64 --> 02:15:08.64
Makes me just want to keep doing the things that are rewarding.

2219
02:15:08.64 --> 02:15:14.64
And that involves other people and building communities and building a bridge between the military and civilian worlds.

2220
02:15:14.64 --> 02:15:19.64
Instead of using these divide and conquer tactics.

2221
02:15:19.64 --> 02:15:22.64
Yeah.

2222
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:28.64
So, how long is this deployment to Iraq to take us back to Iraq? How long were you over there?

2223
02:15:28.64 --> 02:15:32.64
That was 2007, and, I don't know, seven months.

2224
02:15:32.64 --> 02:15:35.64
So you guys were on, like, a seven month rotation.

2225
02:15:35.64 --> 02:15:42.64
Right? And then we, we came back, and that was, coming back was a weird thing.

2226
02:15:42.64 --> 02:15:48.64
I mean, we stopped in Shannon Airport in Ireland and Drankl bunch of beers.

2227
02:15:48.64 --> 02:15:52.64
There was in the, the airport there, because we'd rented a civilian aircraft.

2228
02:15:52.64 --> 02:15:54.64
And there was a bunch of green brazed at flew back.

2229
02:15:54.64 --> 02:15:57.64
So there's sort of a mad dash for the bar, we got there.

2230
02:15:57.64 --> 02:16:06.64
And, and, you know, then we got back, and my car was, for Carson, my car was the same place where I'd park that I disconnected the battery.

2231
02:16:06.64 --> 02:16:09.64
You know, the battery was, I had to connect the battery back.

2232
02:16:09.64 --> 02:16:14.64
We're sort of, in this parking lot around our compound at 10th group.

2233
02:16:14.64 --> 02:16:19.64
And it was just sort of like, oh, I guess I went to war and came back.

2234
02:16:19.64 --> 02:16:24.64
And it just was kind of, it was kind of weird.

2235
02:16:24.64 --> 02:16:31.64
And, you know, there was this other compounding part of my life, which was, you know, I was married to Emily.

2236
02:16:31.64 --> 02:16:37.64
And we had started dating, finally told the girl I loved, the love of my life that I loved her.

2237
02:16:37.64 --> 02:16:40.64
And, oh, and oh, by the way, I'm going to boot camp, right?

2238
02:16:40.64 --> 02:16:47.64
So we had gotten married while I was in the QCourse and she had then gone through the CIA training pipeline to become a case officer.

2239
02:16:47.64 --> 02:16:53.64
She graduated from, to become a case officer five days before I became a green bra.

2240
02:16:53.64 --> 02:16:59.64
Right? And so she got sent to Africa and then I got sent to Colorado and then to Iraq and, you know,

2241
02:16:59.64 --> 02:17:09.64
talking over secure lines with your wife and while you're at war and she kind of had some access through her friends to some of our situation or sit reps,

2242
02:17:09.64 --> 02:17:21.64
situation reports from war and there was, it was just kind of, it was surreal, but so I also felt just really kind of lonely.

2243
02:17:21.64 --> 02:17:26.64
I mean, our team was there, but then they went off and they had their families, their families,

2244
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:37.64
they had created them. And that was just kind of, it was lonely ride and oh, by the way, right when I get back, have my truck and driving off base,

2245
02:17:37.64 --> 02:17:44.64
thankfully I waited to do his off base. But, you know, in Iraq when you're in a Humvee and you're driving, you go down the middle of the road,

2246
02:17:44.64 --> 02:17:50.64
it's a tactic because most roadside bombs are on the side of the road and you don't want to go anyway.

2247
02:17:50.64 --> 02:17:57.64
You just dominate the road. That's how it is. Get out of my way. I've got a bigger truck than you do and that's what's happening.

2248
02:17:57.64 --> 02:18:07.64
And so I defaulted to that on the highway right off Fort Carson and it wasn't some sort of huge flashback or something.

2249
02:18:07.64 --> 02:18:10.64
It was just kind of, I wasn't just home.

2250
02:18:10.64 --> 02:18:27.64
Yeah, I wasn't home yet. And it was just all of these weird emotions going through my head and I had to kind of click my brain and say, hey, I need to slow down, stop, stop flooring it because that's also he drive their speed of security.

2251
02:18:27.64 --> 02:18:30.64
It goes fast as you can and gets on the target, right?

2252
02:18:30.64 --> 02:18:35.64
And move over into the right lane, take a deep breath. It'll be okay.

2253
02:18:35.64 --> 02:18:42.64
And that's more than the actual fact that that happened was just the weird feeling that that happened.

2254
02:18:42.64 --> 02:18:49.64
And then, you know, I didn't have a cell phone set up or anything and all that stuff. It wasn't quite as simple as it is now.

2255
02:18:49.64 --> 02:18:56.64
So I went back, I was staying with my great aunt, uncle and Colorado Springs and then I called, you know,

2256
02:18:56.64 --> 02:19:07.64
had a calling card number to call Emily. She was at working out of the embassy in Abjohn West Africa and it was just sort of this I'm back.

2257
02:19:07.64 --> 02:19:13.64
And it was very anti-climactic just to be on the phone.

2258
02:19:13.64 --> 02:19:20.64
It's not what you see in the movies where you land and there's the big parade and all of that stuff and you know,

2259
02:19:20.64 --> 02:19:26.64
you're loved one sprinting for you and you know, you swoop her off of her feet and do all of these things.

2260
02:19:26.64 --> 02:19:30.64
It was none of that. And then, you know, then the next day, what do you do?

2261
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:37.64
Go back to work, go back to work and inventory all your stuff and make sure that your team rooms clean and do all of that stuff.

2262
02:19:37.64 --> 02:19:40.64
And that's, you know, that's the next couple weeks of your life.

2263
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:47.64
And so, yeah, so that and then eventually obviously I saw Emily have flew over there for Christmas.

2264
02:19:47.64 --> 02:19:53.64
That was, that was the kind of vacation because she's in war torn west Africa.

2265
02:19:53.64 --> 02:19:57.64
It almost was more comfortable to go visit her.

2266
02:19:57.64 --> 02:20:00.64
Oh, you felt a little more normal.

2267
02:20:00.64 --> 02:20:10.64
Well, it was like, you know, so we talk a lot about PTSD and all that stuff this day and age and it's become this kind of thing where every veteran probably has it.

2268
02:20:10.64 --> 02:20:13.64
So I shouldn't hire a veteran or there's something wrong with them.

2269
02:20:13.64 --> 02:20:21.64
I'll donate money, but I'm going to kind of put them on the leprechaunty and let them struggle with their PTSD and send them a paycheck every once in a while.

2270
02:20:21.64 --> 02:20:29.64
That's, that's the situation at its worst. Now, there's, there's obviously various levels of that.

2271
02:20:29.64 --> 02:20:36.64
But it's just, you know, when you came back from war and say, world war too, you know, you're not a ship with everybody that you went to war with.

2272
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.64
There's decompression time.

2273
02:20:38.64 --> 02:20:49.64
But as for us, you know, we're, we're getting on a plane, we're, we're having a couple beers in Shannon. We show back up at home and then we're at home. And this is America. And it is very, very free, right?

2274
02:20:49.64 --> 02:21:02.64
And you know, there's not trash everywhere. People don't just, I mean, in Iraq, everyone's got that what eight foot wall, if you've got an house in any money, you got eight foot wall with concertina or probably barbed wire around the top of it.

2275
02:21:02.64 --> 02:21:19.64
And when you have trash at your house, what you do is you walk out in your front yard and you throw it over your wall because you don't really care about what happens outside your, your little wall. Well, here, it's just, you know, that Colorado air is pretty awesome. And, you know, you can stop anywhere you want and there's no roadside bombs.

2276
02:21:19.64 --> 02:21:27.64
And, you know, it's like what you saw in her locker, the guy goes in and he's staring at all the cereal and there's 10 million things a cereal.

2277
02:21:27.64 --> 02:21:35.64
That's not the decision that you're used to making and it feels weird. Just, it's, it's going to happen so fast.

2278
02:21:35.64 --> 02:21:42.64
And, and so remember, I got off the tarmac, because on the tarmac in, in Abysson, I'd flown over there.

2279
02:21:42.64 --> 02:21:54.64
You know, they love a good coup in Africa. This, it's always kind of semi-permissive and it's never perfect and they could have RPGs and AKs in the street at any time. And you'll be the last to know, right?

2280
02:21:54.64 --> 02:22:02.64
So, got there and it just, it smelled tropical and it smelled just sort of like, like, not America.

2281
02:22:02.64 --> 02:22:09.64
And rolled in and it's just, there's just all this commotion at this African airport and, you know,

2282
02:22:09.64 --> 02:22:16.64
writing back, getting in a car, you know, gave her a big hug and the, and the kiss in the airport.

2283
02:22:16.64 --> 02:22:27.64
And then, got in a car and drove home and there's checkpoints and, you know, there's guys with guns at the checkpoints and then pull into her house and it's, there's two layers to the compound.

2284
02:22:27.64 --> 02:22:40.64
And she was not on an American compound, per se, it was American housing, but not a compound, but it was within a compound with other locals and there's one layer of, quote, security, where there's a local with a pickup truck.

2285
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:50.64
And if you're white, you're here find to go in. I mean, it's, it's just how it is there. And so, you know, so we drove in, they obviously knew her and her car at that point.

2286
02:22:50.64 --> 02:23:02.64
And then, you know, she's got a second layer of, quote, security and it's a renocop basically and they've got a stick, you know, they're not doing anything with that stick, but it's, it's faux security.

2287
02:23:02.64 --> 02:23:14.64
And, but it just, it, it felt more normal to me than coming back to America so quickly. And it was just sort of some decompression time.

2288
02:23:14.64 --> 02:23:31.64
But then, you know, you've got the sort of relationship side and life's hard. And so, you know, she's, and that job, I mean, the CIA works, it's people really hard. You have a lot of people, young people, old people, whatever, that's sort of America that work really, really hard in our true patriots.

2289
02:23:31.64 --> 02:23:53.64
And they're really committed to our way of life in America. And if, if you go that route, you are, it's a 24, 7 job, just like special forces is. And so she's working a hundred hours a week by Wednesday, our, it's, it was not a traditional marriage, you know.

2290
02:23:53.64 --> 02:24:06.64
And it was it all right, we guys getting through it was separation a good thing. Sometimes, you know, the best thing to happen between some couples is they're not around each other. Sometimes that's horrible. It doesn't work.

2291
02:24:06.64 --> 02:24:16.64
Yeah, so we had spent, you know, the first four years of our marriage, we did not live together at all, zero living together.

2292
02:24:16.64 --> 02:24:27.64
As it for Bragg, she was in Florida teaching, she was a, a great Spanish teacher, right. So for the first year of the Q Corps, I'm driving back to Florida every single weekend that I have off.

2293
02:24:27.64 --> 02:24:38.64
So if I'm not in the field, I have the weekend off. So drive back, you know, second year she's going through, she's working out of the, the Langley and then, you know, out of, out of the farm.

2294
02:24:38.64 --> 02:24:52.64
And so kind of doing some of driving north five, six hours every weekend go, see her there. And then, you know, she's in West Africa and I'm in Iraq and then I'm in Colorado and it's, you know, you're, we're,

2295
02:24:52.64 --> 02:25:05.64
a mediums were the thing back then, you know, these sort of, because it wasn't as simple as everyone's got data connections just pull up FaceTime or Skype or whatever the case may be. So, you know, it's a mediums and there was, you know,

2296
02:25:05.64 --> 02:25:25.64
a strange, probably a hundred numbers I had to dial to get the access to get to call her cell phone or her, whatever at her at the embassy. And if you go to the well to often, eventually, the well runs dry. And so when that Christmas, it was just kind of weird with her.

2297
02:25:25.64 --> 02:25:43.64
It wasn't bad. We, she babysat my siblings growing up. She was great friends with my family and my mom and all these things like we really were in love. And, and so we knew each other as friends for almost a decade before we started dating.

2298
02:25:43.64 --> 02:25:55.64
And it just was kind of weird when that, that Christmas. And so it was kind of like, okay, I was going to get out of the army in October of the next year.

2299
02:25:55.64 --> 02:26:08.64
And it's like, okay, well, that became the target, right? Everything's going to be better at that time. And so, you know, was there for a month? And we had fun. It's just was kind of weird. Like life was kind of weird though, too, right?

2300
02:26:08.64 --> 02:26:22.64
I mean, she's in kind of war torn. I'm going to war coming back flying over for some, quote, vacation, you know, and we're finally together. And there's just so many balls in the air. It's hard to make sense of what's going on.

2301
02:26:22.64 --> 02:26:33.64
And so we went back and, you know, back at base, well, we ended up forward deploying the Stoocard to do a backfill for our, our, our commanders and extremists force that was in Stoocard.

2302
02:26:33.64 --> 02:27:02.64
So, with Station there for, I want to say four months, something like that. But in that time, also went down to a different part of West Africa on a mission to work with the Mauritian troops out of New York shot except we were in Octute, which is, you know, a few hours through literally camels and desert in Mauritania. And, you know, we trained up their commandos and we were out there. And the interesting part is that, in much of the world, you know, the US has its diplomats and it has its sole job.

2303
02:27:02.64 --> 02:27:11.64
And that's, and it has its soldiers. And there's kind of a stark difference between those two. In much of the world, the soldiers are where it's at.

2304
02:27:11.64 --> 02:27:20.64
You know, the diplomats, they don't have the real power because they can't, they can't take their soldiers and go drive to the middle of the capital and say, hey, I'm in charge now.

2305
02:27:20.64 --> 02:27:30.64
And so, you know, to go back to follow up on some of the earlier points about, you know, should we be in Iraq or Afghanistan or I think special forces in some capacity should be everywhere.

2306
02:27:30.64 --> 02:27:43.64
Special operations and people who are serving this purpose of working with other host nations. I mean, that was also the lesson of post 9-11. Afghanistan was, you have no presence there.

2307
02:27:43.64 --> 02:27:58.64
You're going to have to recreate it in time of crisis. And that's very challenging. And so, to have some, some presence between militaries, between, hey, the US military has, is working with these locals that are in the military and,

2308
02:27:58.64 --> 02:28:06.64
hey, pick your country. That's important because you, you, it's constant, not like spy stuff, but you just.

2309
02:28:06.64 --> 02:28:11.64
Just relationships, no, you're not allowed to. Yeah. That's it. And that's a really positive thing.

2310
02:28:11.64 --> 02:28:22.64
Very positive. And so, you're also able to, to be there just in case. And so, in those kinds of countries, you know, there's a role for, there's definitely a role for the military.

2311
02:28:22.64 --> 02:28:42.64
Anyway, I was there and even while I'm on that deployment, you know, M flew up on African air, whatever, from Abjah to Nookshat and my captain gave me the time off to go, you know, hang out with Emily in the capital Nookshat for a couple days while she was in town.

2312
02:28:42.64 --> 02:28:56.64
And then our whole team went to a soccer game there in some Chinese built stadium because the Chinese are, are moving into Africa big time, but they, they move in and they set up their own base and they bring their thousand Chinese.

2313
02:28:56.64 --> 02:29:06.64
And they're not doing anything with the locals except extracting what they can from there and their building relationships that way with, with, with money and with their presence.

2314
02:29:06.64 --> 02:29:20.64
And they built soccer stadiums and the locals love soccer and that's kind of what it is. Anyway, that's a bit of a tangent, but it's just to say that our marriage was kind of, it was, a typical.

2315
02:29:20.64 --> 02:29:23.64
And so, you know, I went back and what I did not expect.

2316
02:29:23.64 --> 02:29:34.64
And it was part of the reason that you decided that you were going to get out of the army because this, you know, your marriage, your wife being in the CIA, being on deployment, traveling and you being in the same thing.

2317
02:29:34.64 --> 02:29:43.64
The army was just going to look long term. This just ain't going to work. We just knew it wasn't going to work long term. The, the hope at the time was that it would.

2318
02:29:43.64 --> 02:30:03.64
We would be able to sustain it until it sort of ended. Now, what I did not foresee was the idea of how much I loved serving in the army special forces and how great and, and how, what an honor that was and how impactful those men in that community.

2319
02:30:03.64 --> 02:30:12.64
And that community were and will forever have been on my life. And that became something that I dreaded.

2320
02:30:12.64 --> 02:30:23.64
Leaving that job. And it, it, it sort of just felt like this guillotine that I was facing as I, you know, because it's not like you just show up one day and you say, alright, peace out guys.

2321
02:30:23.64 --> 02:30:35.64
Like you have certain dates and you have to re-enlist prior or you do all these things and, you know, they were really trying to keep guys in because they had invested a lot in us and, you know, the mission wasn't stopping.

2322
02:30:35.64 --> 02:30:52.64
And so, everybody around me understood what was going on with my life. My wife's in the CIA, she's in West Africa, we can't make this work. It's just not possible to be married in these kinds of jobs or roles.

2323
02:30:52.64 --> 02:30:56.64
And so, everyone was supportive.

2324
02:30:56.64 --> 02:31:05.64
But at the same time, I felt like I was quitting. And, and so I started to go through that process and eventually obviously did go through that process.

2325
02:31:05.64 --> 02:31:21.64
And when I, I pulled off base, I had my same green Nissan Xtera, I'd had throughout my whole training life in, in, for brag and then it carcin' in your cars just this very safe place, you know.

2326
02:31:21.64 --> 02:31:32.64
When you, you can turn the AC on if it's hot, if it's cold, you're warm. It's, it's this small notion of privacy. You don't have a car in basic training where you have zero privacy.

2327
02:31:32.64 --> 02:31:46.64
But when, when you have a car, you have a little bit of freedom and, you know, if you're able to use your car for whatever reason before formation or just in general, you have so much that is just creature comforts.

2328
02:31:46.64 --> 02:31:55.64
And drive, drive and off base in Colorado with basically everything I owned in the back of that truck.

2329
02:31:55.64 --> 02:32:02.64
And I just, I cried on the way off base and I couldn't believe it.

2330
02:32:02.64 --> 02:32:11.64
Because this was supposed to be this really positive step in my life. I was going to go get reunited with the love of my life.

2331
02:32:11.64 --> 02:32:21.64
It was going to be, it was supposed to feel different. And I already just hugely missed my, my team.

2332
02:32:21.64 --> 02:32:30.64
I missed that way of life. And I, I felt like I was abandoning them and they were going to go back to war and I wanted to go with them.

2333
02:32:30.64 --> 02:32:40.64
And I was, you know, uniquely, not uniquely. I was well trained in America's eyes to, to be on the front lines and to continue to serve.

2334
02:32:40.64 --> 02:32:48.64
And I believe in our mission and regardless of, you don't always get to choose the destination that you go and that's fine, right?

2335
02:32:48.64 --> 02:32:54.64
I believe that when America says it's time to go, I want to be the kind of person that says send me.

2336
02:32:54.64 --> 02:33:05.64
And so that, that was the sacrifice of the individuality that I was very willing to submit to, to the team and to the mission and to our country.

2337
02:33:05.64 --> 02:33:18.64
And it just felt like I was losing all of that. And so, you know, eventually your tears try and you wake up and you learn how to be resilient again, but it was just, it was just,

2338
02:33:18.64 --> 02:33:20.64
Where did you go? Where was the plan?

2339
02:33:20.64 --> 02:33:29.64
Right. So I, I drove back to Florida where my mom was and I was just going to put my stuff, my car and storage.

2340
02:33:29.64 --> 02:33:37.64
And then I was, I was getting on a plane to fly to Africa to go live with Emily because, you know, I was now her dependent, right?

2341
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:46.64
So it just was a typical because I had not gone with her out of the gates. I mean, it was, you know, you're supposed to be together. That's kind of how this stuff works.

2342
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:58.64
I mean, a community of two, that's a foundational community. Sometimes it's you and your dog, sometimes it's you and your family, but it's, that's a community. And that is very important and not only my life, but our lives.

2343
02:33:58.64 --> 02:34:13.64
And so, you know, that was the plan. Drop my stuff off, get on a plane and fly over. Well, I did that. And it was just as weird as it was that Christmas before, it was just a lot weirder.

2344
02:34:13.64 --> 02:34:22.64
Just everything was, it just nothing felt right. And, you know, I didn't have mission or purpose. She, you know, she was used to operating alone.

2345
02:34:22.64 --> 02:34:34.64
I mean, she was her and her dog, Java, right? And so, you know, that was her like 100 hours a week by Wednesday, 24, 7, all the time. And then I'm showing up almost like dead weight.

2346
02:34:34.64 --> 02:34:40.64
Because I got this, I got this sort of chip on my shoulder because I just gave up everything to be with her.

2347
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:47.64
And, you know, it was just very, it's just not fun.

2348
02:34:47.64 --> 02:34:55.64
You know, this, this sounds like a nightmare because you're showing up there. You just got out of special forces. You just got back from these deployments.

2349
02:34:55.64 --> 02:35:02.64
And you have been turning and burning work in 20 hour days for the past, however many years. And then you show up.

2350
02:35:02.64 --> 02:35:09.64
And she's in the middle of that exact lifestyle. And you're like, I'm going to watch more TV right now.

2351
02:35:09.64 --> 02:35:19.64
I mean, this is a nightmare. It was horrible. There was nothing to do, right? So I even applied for jobs at the embassy. I'm thinking, how do I serve for the next year?

2352
02:35:19.64 --> 02:35:31.64
Because she was going to be there for the next year. How do I do something here for the next year? And literally the only job available that I could get was as the janitor of the embassy.

2353
02:35:31.64 --> 02:35:41.64
And as a reference earlier, I'm not above mopping the floors and cleaning the head. I was not ready for that at that time in my life though.

2354
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:54.64
That's just not what I couldn't go from this thinking that this vision that I had for myself and for working with these guys on this team to I'm the janitor of pushing the mop at the embassy.

2355
02:35:54.64 --> 02:36:00.64
And oh, by the way, you know, my wife's on the top floor in this, you know, really cool job.

2356
02:36:00.64 --> 02:36:20.64
She's saving America. Yeah, on the front lines and I'm doing nothing but cleaning the head and so that flicks didn't even exist at that time. So there was armed forces network was all that we got and you know, so then it's it's me and Java at the house, right?

2357
02:36:20.64 --> 02:36:40.64
And this is where this was the beginning of my life turning into that bad country song where a guy's got his dog and you know, his sort of bottle of whiskey and all of his sorrows and you know, I ended up only being in Africa for about two months.

2358
02:36:40.64 --> 02:37:00.64
And then I was like, we're this just isn't where this is too miserable to endure and it wasn't sort of like we didn't hate each other by any stretch and oh, by the way, I'll get to the point somewhere down the line where we got divorced and then we eventually got back together and we're together now, right?

2359
02:37:00.64 --> 02:37:12.64
So it's even ten times mess year, but at this point, you know, we were just really good friends and we had gone to the well for too long and I just didn't.

2360
02:37:12.64 --> 02:37:24.64
I wasn't a part of her journey and she wasn't a part of mine and we were trying to make it work and we said, okay, we'll skip to the end and that just didn't work. And so I'm then I'm flying back to to.

2361
02:37:24.64 --> 02:37:32.64
We were you left where you like, yeah, this is, did you leave on hey, this is probably not going to work or did you leave on like, okay, well, I'm going to go figure some stuff out in America, she's going to stay.

2362
02:37:32.64 --> 02:37:36.64
Well, you guys still thinking it was going to stay together at this point.

2363
02:37:36.64 --> 02:37:41.64
Hope is not a strategy and we were at best hoping and it just it felt like a sledgehammer.

2364
02:37:41.64 --> 02:37:45.64
So when you rolled out where you kind of like, yeah, this is probably the end of it.

2365
02:37:45.64 --> 02:37:47.64
Or do you know, want to say this on the air right now?

2366
02:37:47.64 --> 02:37:52.64
No, no, I mean, I think it was just very, it was just very confusing.

2367
02:37:52.64 --> 02:37:59.64
I mean, for me, and this was very mutual, by the way, this was not all me or all her. This was both of us.

2368
02:37:59.64 --> 02:38:06.64
And it was, you know, she didn't want to, she didn't want to bend her lifestyle for me.

2369
02:38:06.64 --> 02:38:10.64
I mean, what she think it she was going to stay in the agency forever at this point.

2370
02:38:10.64 --> 02:38:18.64
Right. So I mean, this is how this was the ultimate irony was that, you know, part of the journey that I wanted was to go join Ground Branch.

2371
02:38:18.64 --> 02:38:22.64
The CIA, that's where it started. Mike Span, you know, rest in peace.

2372
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:28.64
When when we honor our heroes, it will inspire further service and that had inspired service in me.

2373
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:33.64
And so I didn't know anybody in that process of hiring to get to Ground Branch.

2374
02:38:33.64 --> 02:38:38.64
I didn't know anybody and I eventually started and made it through and became a green barray.

2375
02:38:38.64 --> 02:38:42.64
And in Emily's training, I met lots of people in Ground Branch.

2376
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:51.64
They became friends of ours. And so it was kind of, hey, why don't you just come back and go through the process and that's how it works.

2377
02:38:51.64 --> 02:38:59.64
Right. If you know someone, you're a more of a trusted person, and especially in that place, the agency is always looking for things to do with spouses.

2378
02:38:59.64 --> 02:39:03.64
I mean, if you can, because you're already trusted, right?

2379
02:39:03.64 --> 02:39:09.64
I mean, there's risks in that job of leaks and all that stuff that you have to trust your spouse.

2380
02:39:09.64 --> 02:39:14.64
And so it felt like, okay, well, I guess I can go do that.

2381
02:39:14.64 --> 02:39:24.64
And so started reapplying for some of that stuff, but frankly, I mean, I was not in the, I didn't have a headspace at that time.

2382
02:39:24.64 --> 02:39:28.64
To, I went from Hero to Zero real fast.

2383
02:39:28.64 --> 02:39:38.64
And I'm sleeping on my buddy's slanted floor couch, you know, apartment with a slanted floor on his couch in New York and the lower east side for four months.

2384
02:39:38.64 --> 02:39:48.64
I mean, he's a bartender, most of the only times I'd leave the place, I'm going for his shift to, you know, drink free booze at where he was working.

2385
02:39:48.64 --> 02:39:52.64
I mean, like, it was just, it was, I mean, call it what you want.

2386
02:39:52.64 --> 02:39:58.64
Some state of depression or not having mission or purpose in my life.

2387
02:39:58.64 --> 02:40:07.64
And feeling like now I don't have no job, no mission, no purpose, no wife, which I was kind of banking on as the founder of the house.

2388
02:40:07.64 --> 02:40:18.64
Thinking on as the foundation for the rest of my life, you expect something to go a certain way and it doesn't, that's harder than just knowing that something's going to be miserable the whole time.

2389
02:40:18.64 --> 02:40:29.64
And so it was just one of those things where M and I stayed in touch, we even, you know, took a trip to Morocco together and it was still weird and then eventually, you know, she came back to you.

2390
02:40:29.64 --> 02:40:39.64
So you guys need to go to a place like Hawaii or, you know, the Bahamas, you guys keep going random African nations that are in turmoil.

2391
02:40:39.64 --> 02:40:41.64
Yeah, I want to think through that.

2392
02:40:41.64 --> 02:40:44.64
So I'm actually something from Uncle Jockel for here.

2393
02:40:44.64 --> 02:40:50.64
Well, the other part of this is I'm actually insufferable on a beach with nothing to do, right, and suffer, like, what am I supposed to do?

2394
02:40:50.64 --> 02:40:51.64
You can surf.

2395
02:40:51.64 --> 02:40:53.64
I wish I could.

2396
02:40:53.64 --> 02:40:54.64
You can try.

2397
02:40:54.64 --> 02:40:55.64
I can try.

2398
02:40:55.64 --> 02:40:56.64
You're right.

2399
02:40:56.64 --> 02:40:58.64
I can be really bad at it until I'm less bad.

2400
02:40:58.64 --> 02:41:01.64
I'm not even in places without security checkpoints is what I'm advising.

2401
02:41:01.64 --> 02:41:02.64
Yeah, got it.

2402
02:41:02.64 --> 02:41:04.64
Future reference.

2403
02:41:04.64 --> 02:41:15.64
So we're kind of, you know, in touch again and doing this weird, long distance thing and it just, it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and it's sort of confused.

2404
02:41:15.64 --> 02:41:21.64
She comes back to America and has Java and Java formed a really big bond with him.

2405
02:41:21.64 --> 02:41:23.64
Well, I was in Africa because he was kind of my only friend.

2406
02:41:23.64 --> 02:41:29.64
And so my only friend, Java and Francis Francis was our housekeeper and sort of like almost like him's chief of staff for the house.

2407
02:41:29.64 --> 02:41:37.64
She would have parties to over to house or she would host people or whatever and he was just make that train roll.

2408
02:41:37.64 --> 02:41:44.64
And I became really good friends with him and he was my best friend in Java and I was at the house all day.

2409
02:41:44.64 --> 02:41:52.64
And for a period of months and this is anyway really fast transition to doing nothing and having no purpose.

2410
02:41:52.64 --> 02:42:02.64
So eventually she comes back and it's still really bad and we're just sort of subjecting ourselves to further misery, right?

2411
02:42:02.64 --> 02:42:05.64
But you say you hope, oh, this is going to get better.

2412
02:42:05.64 --> 02:42:06.64
It's going to get better.

2413
02:42:06.64 --> 02:42:07.64
How's it going to get better, right?

2414
02:42:07.64 --> 02:42:09.64
I mean, something's got to give.

2415
02:42:09.64 --> 02:42:16.64
And then eventually you just, you can't endure it anymore and so it's like, you know, she's like, hey, I'm done.

2416
02:42:16.64 --> 02:42:24.64
And so went through that, I stole that because I'm.

2417
02:42:24.64 --> 02:42:29.64
The eternal optimist, right? I mean, this everything can work out if given enough time and and then it almost becomes a competition of who can suffer more, right?

2418
02:42:29.64 --> 02:42:36.64
And I think I can suffer a lot and I'm willing to kind of be that kind of martyr if left to.

2419
02:42:36.64 --> 02:42:43.64
If left in a situation where I want what I want, I'll suffer almost anything.

2420
02:42:43.64 --> 02:42:56.64
And so eventually you just move on and you know, I started business school, which I applied to and I also had this little hobby for.

2421
02:42:56.64 --> 02:43:03.64
Go rock that was kind of nothing at that time, but she had actually recommended it.

2422
02:43:03.64 --> 02:43:08.64
The first time I went to Africa because I built her a go bag, I built her a go rock.

2423
02:43:08.64 --> 02:43:16.64
And that was something that then I just was applying what I didn't wore. You have a go bag.

2424
02:43:16.64 --> 02:43:22.64
You put it in the trunk of the Humvee in case vehicle gets disabled and you got to fight, right?

2425
02:43:22.64 --> 02:43:30.64
So you have bombs and guns and batteries, all that kind of stuff and it's just extra supplies that you don't want to have on your back all the time.

2426
02:43:30.64 --> 02:43:34.64
And you might as well have more if the trucks going to carry it around with you.

2427
02:43:34.64 --> 02:43:43.64
So are for you. So I had done that for her and made one at her house and made some others for some of the other folks that she was working with at the embassy.

2428
02:43:43.64 --> 02:43:49.64
And when I was trying to figure out what to do, we were trying to figure out what I could do.

2429
02:43:49.64 --> 02:43:52.64
She's like, you should do the go rock thing.

2430
02:43:52.64 --> 02:43:58.64
And that just kind of meant teach people what you know from social forces or build them go bags or whatever, figure it out.

2431
02:43:58.64 --> 02:44:06.64
Like, here's something, do that. And that idea had kind of stayed alive as I came home.

2432
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:18.64
And but I was not in any position to commit to anything as significant as kind of starting a business and going full throttle.

2433
02:44:18.64 --> 02:44:20.64
And then.

2434
02:44:20.64 --> 02:44:32.64
Yeah, so so I'm sleeping on my buddy's couch and I'm kind of trying to figure out, okay, well, I got this go rock thing and I'm applying the business schools and I'm applying to the CIA, which is just another re-up process.

2435
02:44:32.64 --> 02:44:43.64
It nothing happens fast even when you're a spouse and I'm still technically a spouse. So it's it's easier and I know all the right people through through Emily, which you know, because I'm her dependent now.

2436
02:44:43.64 --> 02:45:08.64
Like we joked because one time when she was at the farm and we went to we went to Bush gardens in Williamsburg and we got a discount on the the entrance because we're active due I was active duty military and she was my quote dependent right it's a military term like it's not a it's not like we're equals.

2437
02:45:08.64 --> 02:45:21.64
And then I are very much equals and always happened, but she's my dependent legally and I was then later her dependent legally, but at Bush gardens they gave her a necklace that said hero dependent.

2438
02:45:21.64 --> 02:45:22.64
She loves that.

2439
02:45:22.64 --> 02:45:26.64
Yeah, we both just sort of chuckled about it. It was it was.

2440
02:45:26.64 --> 02:45:30.64
She'd certainly go over to you like eight months later, we're you got out.

2441
02:45:30.64 --> 02:45:47.64
There you go. Yeah, it was in a box somewhere like everything else. I still I still have it in my work desk at now it go rock and it's something that makes both of us smile now, but so basically I had these these kind of.

2442
02:45:47.64 --> 02:46:14.64
I'm applying for more stuff trying to do something I mean the idea of filling out an application to go to grad school was just a hugely daunting task this should take you know two or three hours it was months in decisiveness in inability to function and you know we talk about military transitions are hard like whoever you are if you lose all of your support structures everyone's got a break in point.

2443
02:46:14.64 --> 02:46:34.64
I mean this is one of the lessons of searschool survival school no matter how tough you think you are you are breakable and you know all of my support structures were gone and but go rock became a hobby so I had this idea for okay well I guess I'll try to figure out how to design a backpack or a rucksack and thankfully I actually

2444
02:46:34.64 --> 02:46:50.64
unbeknownst to me almost knew a lot about this topic that I just sort of gravitated toward it because I knew a lot about it even though I didn't have some conversation that said I really know about rocking and rucksack I was not my own id boosting my own

2445
02:46:50.64 --> 02:47:04.64
you know sense of self worth through something that I thought would be a great way to spend time it was just something to do and so you know didn't know anything about manufacturing didn't know anything about anything but

2446
02:47:04.64 --> 02:47:19.64
eventually was like okay well I got I'll start doing something with this put an ad in craigslist new york city for a backpack designer and like all right well see what we get I got kind of some sketches and I got some samples and I want something that's kind of like these

2447
02:47:19.64 --> 02:47:44.64
and got a response back from this team in Montana that was basically trolling the internet for work because in 2009 the economy was not in a good place so you have to put yourself into those kinds of perspectives you know you like to say good about a lot of stuff you know bad stuff happens good well look the economy was in a really bad spot good

2448
02:47:44.64 --> 02:48:00.64
good if you're looking for work good if you're trying to do something awesome because there's a lot more opportunity whereas when nobody's looking for work and everything's really expensive and you can't find any deals because the economy is just purring forward

2449
02:48:00.64 --> 02:48:15.64
it's harder you got to you got to speed things up faster so anyway found this great team out there and basically worked on the rocks and how to do them throughout my first year in business school

2450
02:48:15.64 --> 02:48:33.64
and then when did that develop into or how long was business school so business school was from 2009 to 2011 and so even business school is I applied to a couple schools and it's like I don't even know if I want to go to business school I mean that it's like it's so weird to think about now

2451
02:48:33.64 --> 02:48:48.64
I've got these chapters in my life and I look back at them and it's hard to relate to myself now in some of those chapters it's like when I think about deploying to war and all the training that I went through and the people that I served with

2452
02:48:48.64 --> 02:49:04.64
it feels like I'm reading my own book sometimes right my own kind of narrative in my head it's I don't wake up like rambo every day or anything you know I've taken a ton of lessons from that but I don't

2453
02:49:04.64 --> 02:49:23.64
I also can't relate to being just depressed like why don't you just stop being depressed that's what I would sit and just stop doing this and the right answer is move forward anyway you can if you're feeling sorry for yourself go to something for someone else and you know eventually M came back we sort

2454
02:49:23.64 --> 02:49:42.58
of

2455
02:49:42.58 --> 02:49:51.48
you

2456
02:49:51.48 --> 02:49:54.60
And also the post 9-11 GI Bill.

2457
02:49:54.60 --> 02:49:59.04
And you know, transitioning veterans out there, you should use that.

2458
02:49:59.04 --> 02:50:06.44
It is a great way for you to buy some time and re-aclimate yourself to America and gain

2459
02:50:06.44 --> 02:50:09.68
a skill, some knowledge, some whatever.

2460
02:50:09.68 --> 02:50:11.04
And it's structure.

2461
02:50:11.04 --> 02:50:16.32
And so I'm grateful to the American taxpayer for, you know, pay for some housing allowance

2462
02:50:16.32 --> 02:50:17.68
and some books.

2463
02:50:17.68 --> 02:50:23.16
And it distressed my life a little bit at a time when I needed less stress in my life.

2464
02:50:23.16 --> 02:50:29.44
And so going through business school and M and I had gotten, you know, officially divorced,

2465
02:50:29.44 --> 02:50:32.32
but she was waiting to go on another assignment.

2466
02:50:32.32 --> 02:50:37.52
She was going to go somewhere else down south, either Brazil or Mexico or something.

2467
02:50:37.52 --> 02:50:42.08
And you know, she had Java and she's living in a hotel in DC because she's only supposed

2468
02:50:42.08 --> 02:50:43.24
to be there for a few months.

2469
02:50:43.24 --> 02:50:47.20
And Java was the fight between the two of us.

2470
02:50:47.20 --> 02:50:49.000
We never thought about money.

2471
02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.64
We always loved each other.

2472
02:50:50.64 --> 02:50:55.24
We were always friends, but Java was the fight because there's not two jobs.

2473
02:50:55.24 --> 02:51:02.96
And so, you know, I'll never forget this moment where I was staying in a Hedakondo in not too

2474
02:51:02.96 --> 02:51:05.96
far from Georgetown, the University in Georgetown.

2475
02:51:05.96 --> 02:51:10.52
And she was staying at a hotel in P Street, so hotel Palamar, because it's dog friendly.

2476
02:51:10.52 --> 02:51:16.04
And we're sort of at dual custody of our dog, Java, right?

2477
02:51:16.04 --> 02:51:21.56
And it's like, this is what we both got really emotional about.

2478
02:51:21.56 --> 02:51:23.000
Because he had been with her.

2479
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.56
He was kind of her dog, but he also was kind of my dog.

2480
02:51:26.56 --> 02:51:31.000
And he had been on, you know, so just to put some of her work and perspective, you know,

2481
02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:38.80
she's going as 110-pound girl out to go on termination meetings with assets.

2482
02:51:38.80 --> 02:51:42.16
Meaning you're telling them you're not going to pay them anymore, which is there only

2483
02:51:42.16 --> 02:51:46.80
a lot of the hidden life. Thanks for your service and the intelligence that you got us,

2484
02:51:46.80 --> 02:51:48.20
but we don't need you anymore.

2485
02:51:48.20 --> 02:51:53.36
That's your threatening someone's livelihood, be very careful how you are around them.

2486
02:51:53.36 --> 02:51:58.64
And in her case, there was Java in the back seat with fangs at the ready.

2487
02:51:58.64 --> 02:52:04.40
Should anyone get elevated or, you know, escalation of tone, temper or whatever, Java was

2488
02:52:04.40 --> 02:52:05.40
back there.

2489
02:52:05.40 --> 02:52:08.56
And he was very much her protector.

2490
02:52:08.56 --> 02:52:14.48
And they had, obviously, a very close relationship as well.

2491
02:52:14.48 --> 02:52:18.72
And so it just got so bad about Java.

2492
02:52:18.72 --> 02:52:20.72
She gave me a really big hug.

2493
02:52:20.72 --> 02:52:25.28
We were standing on the sidewalk off of her hotel.

2494
02:52:25.28 --> 02:52:29.08
So a little bit closer towards the Georgetown side on, on P Street.

2495
02:52:29.08 --> 02:52:33.32
And she goes, you need him even more than I do.

2496
02:52:33.32 --> 02:52:35.96
So here you go.

2497
02:52:35.96 --> 02:52:40.72
And then it was Java was mine.

2498
02:52:40.72 --> 02:52:45.000
And I felt guilty, right?

2499
02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:49.40
And it was just really, but I was also really still talking.

2500
02:52:49.40 --> 02:52:50.88
I still talking.

2501
02:52:50.88 --> 02:52:52.60
You are absolutely right.

2502
02:52:52.60 --> 02:52:54.60
I still absolutely took that dog.

2503
02:52:54.60 --> 02:53:01.32
And that dog is uniquely responsible for my turnaround in life.

2504
02:53:01.32 --> 02:53:03.80
So because here's the thing.

2505
02:53:03.80 --> 02:53:05.92
You need mission.

2506
02:53:05.92 --> 02:53:07.04
You need purpose, you need community.

2507
02:53:07.04 --> 02:53:09.80
You and her dog, that's a community of two.

2508
02:53:09.80 --> 02:53:16.44
And that is a million times better place to be than a community of one, which is not a community

2509
02:53:16.44 --> 02:53:17.44
at all.

2510
02:53:17.44 --> 02:53:18.44
Right?

2511
02:53:18.44 --> 02:53:19.44
It's even a military side of it.

2512
02:53:19.44 --> 02:53:23.000
If there's two of you, you can cover 360 degrees of security.

2513
02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:24.32
If there's one of you, you can't.

2514
02:53:24.32 --> 02:53:25.48
You're alone.

2515
02:53:25.48 --> 02:53:27.24
And that's not a good place to be in life.

2516
02:53:27.24 --> 02:53:28.60
You need other people.

2517
02:53:28.60 --> 02:53:30.56
We are hardwired for this.

2518
02:53:30.56 --> 02:53:33.76
And it is better for us to be around other people.

2519
02:53:33.76 --> 02:53:36.44
And so now I have Java.

2520
02:53:36.44 --> 02:53:39.44
And dogs have to do things like go to the bathroom.

2521
02:53:39.44 --> 02:53:41.68
And Java needed exercise.

2522
02:53:41.68 --> 02:53:46.72
And he would let me know and no uncertain terms that he needed to go out and that he wanted

2523
02:53:46.72 --> 02:53:51.52
to go to the creek and that he wanted to then go a little bit further down the path.

2524
02:53:51.52 --> 02:53:57.24
And I just I poured all of my grief into that dog.

2525
02:53:57.24 --> 02:53:59.96
And I felt so much better for it.

2526
02:53:59.96 --> 02:54:04.72
And then you start, you take one step and you can take many.

2527
02:54:04.72 --> 02:54:08.68
And so that was just the start of slowly.

2528
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:09.80
And it doesn't happen like that.

2529
02:54:09.80 --> 02:54:11.48
It's like, when did you become a great leader?

2530
02:54:11.48 --> 02:54:13.44
I mean, people ask you that.

2531
02:54:13.44 --> 02:54:14.44
So I get that.

2532
02:54:14.44 --> 02:54:15.68
It doesn't work like that.

2533
02:54:15.68 --> 02:54:17.000
It doesn't work like that.

2534
02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:21.60
You've got to just take one step forward and see where that path goes.

2535
02:54:21.60 --> 02:54:27.72
And when you're at a low spot in life, I mean, get a dog, work hard, stuff like that.

2536
02:54:27.72 --> 02:54:33.64
I mean, Java got me out and was just my absolute rock and life for the next several years.

2537
02:54:33.64 --> 02:54:38.32
And he passed away in 2013, got sick and passed away of something.

2538
02:54:38.32 --> 02:54:39.24
We don't know what.

2539
02:54:39.24 --> 02:54:44.48
But anyway, by that point, I was doing much, much better.

2540
02:54:44.48 --> 02:54:49.08
And it used the time in business school to kind of incubate, go rock and met a lot of

2541
02:54:49.08 --> 02:54:54.96
people there that that hugely impacted the direction that go rock would take.

2542
02:54:54.96 --> 02:55:01.88
So how to go rock get to get from this idea of teaching people about to go back to what

2543
02:55:01.88 --> 02:55:03.12
it is right now.

2544
02:55:03.12 --> 02:55:04.12
Yeah.

2545
02:55:04.12 --> 02:55:07.28
So it started out with one rock sack, GR1.

2546
02:55:07.28 --> 02:55:11.28
And there's then I did an napkin sketch of it and eventually figured out how to get

2547
02:55:11.28 --> 02:55:16.56
that through the process of you get something R&D and then you find a factory that will

2548
02:55:16.56 --> 02:55:20.08
build it, which is, by the way, a completely different process.

2549
02:55:20.08 --> 02:55:22.52
And then there's things like order minimums.

2550
02:55:22.52 --> 02:55:31.20
And you have to spend every dollar I had to get any inventory at all.

2551
02:55:31.20 --> 02:55:39.64
And the thing is, at that point, that was May of 2010 was when the first rocks were for sale.

2552
02:55:39.64 --> 02:55:43.60
And I thought, man, we've been working on this officially since, you know, the original

2553
02:55:43.60 --> 02:55:46.28
idea was late 2007.

2554
02:55:46.28 --> 02:55:49.52
Officially started the company in February of 2008.

2555
02:55:49.52 --> 02:55:52.48
It's just a way to, while I was still agreeing.

2556
02:55:52.48 --> 02:55:55.68
I was just a way to catalog costs.

2557
02:55:55.68 --> 02:55:57.84
Like, oh, there's, I got to take a trip here.

2558
02:55:57.84 --> 02:56:00.40
I got to pay this person to design these things.

2559
02:56:00.40 --> 02:56:01.72
I guess it's a company.

2560
02:56:01.72 --> 02:56:02.72
Right?

2561
02:56:02.72 --> 02:56:04.000
I never had a lemonade stand as a kid.

2562
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Okay?

2563
02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:10.08
I would not some eager, on-trip for nerd, like this is what I have to do in my life.

2564
02:56:10.08 --> 02:56:12.92
I just kind of backed into this.

2565
02:56:12.92 --> 02:56:14.40
And then I have a company.

2566
02:56:14.40 --> 02:56:15.92
And then, you know, it starts to kick in.

2567
02:56:15.92 --> 02:56:17.16
I hate to lose.

2568
02:56:17.16 --> 02:56:18.16
I hate losing.

2569
02:56:18.16 --> 02:56:19.80
Hate it, right?

2570
02:56:19.80 --> 02:56:20.80
And so I don't want to lose.

2571
02:56:20.80 --> 02:56:22.68
I don't want to quit on this.

2572
02:56:22.68 --> 02:56:24.36
I'd have already quit on a marriage.

2573
02:56:24.36 --> 02:56:25.04
That's how it felt.

2574
02:56:25.04 --> 02:56:26.68
I already quit on a team.

2575
02:56:26.68 --> 02:56:30.12
I already quit on what I held most sacred in life.

2576
02:56:30.12 --> 02:56:31.40
And that's what it felt like.

2577
02:56:31.40 --> 02:56:33.16
And so I don't want to quit on this.

2578
02:56:33.16 --> 02:56:39.56
So I took all of my kind of perception of failure.

2579
02:56:39.56 --> 02:56:42.12
And I had my dog by my side.

2580
02:56:42.12 --> 02:56:44.12
And I just refused to quit at this.

2581
02:56:44.12 --> 02:56:47.72
And so in May of 2010, the rucks came out.

2582
02:56:47.72 --> 02:56:49.68
And I thought, oh, this is awesome.

2583
02:56:49.68 --> 02:56:51.48
I spent a lot of time developing this.

2584
02:56:51.48 --> 02:56:52.88
Everyone's going to want one of these.

2585
02:56:52.88 --> 02:56:55.56
How are you going to keep inventory up with this demand?

2586
02:56:55.56 --> 02:56:56.56
Come on.

2587
02:56:56.56 --> 02:57:00.56
It's just going to fly off the shelves like magic.

2588
02:57:00.56 --> 02:57:02.96
I mean, I can't believe I thought of this.

2589
02:57:02.96 --> 02:57:03.96
I'm so brilliant.

2590
02:57:03.96 --> 02:57:04.96
Yep.

2591
02:57:04.96 --> 02:57:06.52
The name is great.

2592
02:57:06.52 --> 02:57:10.84
Every pixel on our one page website is perfect.

2593
02:57:10.84 --> 02:57:15.44
And you know, it's silence was the world's answer.

2594
02:57:15.44 --> 02:57:17.000
It just was absolute silence.

2595
02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.36
And nobody bought anything.

2596
02:57:19.36 --> 02:57:22.40
And I was like, man, this is terrible.

2597
02:57:22.40 --> 02:57:28.60
So I had this great and by great, I mean, horrible idea to drive around the country to

2598
02:57:28.60 --> 02:57:32.44
48 states, by the way, with my dog, Java.

2599
02:57:32.44 --> 02:57:37.52
And go meet anybody I could meet would possibly be interested in buying a rucks.

2600
02:57:37.52 --> 02:57:41.84
Like I felt like Willie Loman, except that wasn't selling shoes in death of a salesman.

2601
02:57:41.84 --> 02:57:45.16
I'm like selling rucksacks out of the back of my truck.

2602
02:57:45.16 --> 02:57:46.16
Yeah.

2603
02:57:46.16 --> 02:57:47.80
Which actually, everyone needs shoes.

2604
02:57:47.80 --> 02:57:49.68
Everyone doesn't necessarily need a rucksack.

2605
02:57:49.68 --> 02:57:52.48
So you're already starting to rucks a lot.

2606
02:57:52.48 --> 02:57:58.88
So did that drove the 48 states and went to sort of small retail shops and got the

2607
02:57:58.88 --> 02:58:00.76
Heisman from everybody, right?

2608
02:58:00.76 --> 02:58:02.36
Like, no.

2609
02:58:02.36 --> 02:58:04.08
You know, arm out front.

2610
02:58:04.08 --> 02:58:05.36
This is too expensive.

2611
02:58:05.36 --> 02:58:10.12
You know, the retail price was 295 bucks for a rucksack.

2612
02:58:10.12 --> 02:58:11.56
And they were all made in America.

2613
02:58:11.56 --> 02:58:13.56
And they're, it's just really expensive.

2614
02:58:13.56 --> 02:58:18.64
When I first saw the cost side of what it was going to cost, like this is insanity.

2615
02:58:18.64 --> 02:58:21.24
And basically it was.

2616
02:58:21.24 --> 02:58:24.36
So luckily you knew that everyone would want these.

2617
02:58:24.36 --> 02:58:25.36
Exactly.

2618
02:58:25.36 --> 02:58:34.76
So the question became what I did not know how to do was anything related to business doctrine.

2619
02:58:34.76 --> 02:58:38.20
I don't know anything about online advertising.

2620
02:58:38.20 --> 02:58:40.48
I don't know anything about wholesale.

2621
02:58:40.48 --> 02:58:42.32
I don't know anything about ads.

2622
02:58:42.32 --> 02:58:44.72
I don't know anything.

2623
02:58:44.72 --> 02:58:50.08
But what I did know how to do was to work with these designers.

2624
02:58:50.08 --> 02:58:54.44
And they gave me a heck of an education in just the manufacturing world.

2625
02:58:54.44 --> 02:58:57.12
And I'm just grateful that I found them.

2626
02:58:57.12 --> 02:59:02.08
Just huge education about all the trade-offs in product and you know, what you can and

2627
02:59:02.08 --> 02:59:03.08
can't do.

2628
02:59:03.08 --> 02:59:04.28
And that became my foundation.

2629
02:59:04.28 --> 02:59:08.72
They became teachers to me for two years as we were developing this.

2630
02:59:08.72 --> 02:59:12.60
And eventually got a great piece of gear.

2631
02:59:12.60 --> 02:59:15.24
And that wasn't enough though.

2632
02:59:15.24 --> 02:59:19.88
And so went back to the basics and said, what do I know how to do?

2633
02:59:19.88 --> 02:59:24.000
Because I didn't want to slave over a computer and figure out Facebook ads.

2634
02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.000
I just didn't.

2635
02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:28.32
And I should have probably except maybe I shouldn't have.

2636
02:59:28.32 --> 02:59:34.28
Because what I didn't know how to do was to teach others and how to train others and

2637
02:59:34.28 --> 02:59:36.000
how to build teams.

2638
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:40.64
And I learned that from the guys who had taught me that in special forces and then working

2639
02:59:40.64 --> 02:59:46.40
with them by with and through partner forces in Iraq and in Africa.

2640
02:59:46.40 --> 02:59:51.24
And so came up with something called the GoRuck Challenge, which was a rocking based event

2641
02:59:51.24 --> 02:59:52.88
imagine that.

2642
02:59:52.88 --> 02:59:56.60
Because that's all my training was and now we have Rucksacks.

2643
02:59:56.60 --> 03:00:01.60
And anybody could sign up and it would be led by a special forces guy.

2644
03:00:01.60 --> 03:00:03.88
And at that time it was just me.

2645
03:00:03.88 --> 03:00:09.56
And so it was sort of details not forthcoming and you show up at one in the morning

2646
03:00:09.56 --> 03:00:11.88
and this could go very long time.

2647
03:00:11.88 --> 03:00:13.68
There's no published route.

2648
03:00:13.68 --> 03:00:16.12
There's no published distance.

2649
03:00:16.12 --> 03:00:18.56
It's just us.

2650
03:00:18.56 --> 03:00:23.12
And you're going to do what's told.

2651
03:00:23.12 --> 03:00:26.04
You lunge around the building till I get tired style.

2652
03:00:26.04 --> 03:00:30.48
And yet the other part of it was I didn't want it to be like boot camp.

2653
03:00:30.48 --> 03:00:36.68
That was the one thing out of the gates was yelling and screaming has its place but in boot

2654
03:00:36.68 --> 03:00:37.84
camp.

2655
03:00:37.84 --> 03:00:40.84
Because you have to get people's attention and you have to tear them down.

2656
03:00:40.84 --> 03:00:45.16
You just don't have that time when people are actually giving you their time and paying

2657
03:00:45.16 --> 03:00:46.52
you to be there.

2658
03:00:46.52 --> 03:00:51.12
So you know it was we weigh the Rucksacks down and they would put bricks in the Rucks and

2659
03:00:51.12 --> 03:00:56.04
then we would do PT and a guided tour of the city and they would face a lot of it

2660
03:00:56.04 --> 03:01:00.68
diversity and I would just apply the lessons that I'd learned in my training to building

2661
03:01:00.68 --> 03:01:04.20
a team out of this small crew.

2662
03:01:04.20 --> 03:01:06.36
And then that started to expand.

2663
03:01:06.36 --> 03:01:12.96
Yes, so what turned out to happen is that those people did the work for me.

2664
03:01:12.96 --> 03:01:18.60
They went on Facebook and Google and used their networks and told people about GoRuck.

2665
03:01:18.60 --> 03:01:21.52
And oh yeah, there's gear that we manufacture.

2666
03:01:21.52 --> 03:01:25.88
Like at a foundational level we design and manufacture all of our own gear and it's meant

2667
03:01:25.88 --> 03:01:30.84
to withstand this really difficult and challenging stuff and it's really good at carrying

2668
03:01:30.84 --> 03:01:32.04
weight.

2669
03:01:32.04 --> 03:01:35.60
All the things that I would have wanted out of an assault pack that's kind of what we did

2670
03:01:35.60 --> 03:01:36.60
with this.

2671
03:01:36.60 --> 03:01:40.88
We just sort of streamlined it so it didn't look like a military assault pack.

2672
03:01:40.88 --> 03:01:41.88
Right.

2673
03:01:41.88 --> 03:01:46.96
And so when we were that first GoRuck challenge that was September 25th of 2010.

2674
03:01:46.96 --> 03:01:47.96
Okay.

2675
03:01:47.96 --> 03:01:49.44
So it happened pretty fast.

2676
03:01:49.44 --> 03:01:51.24
When is the next one happen?

2677
03:01:51.24 --> 03:01:54.36
So the next one happened the next month.

2678
03:01:54.36 --> 03:02:00.72
And it was basically in it was in DC after the first one were you like, okay, this might

2679
03:02:00.72 --> 03:02:02.72
be a path right here.

2680
03:02:02.72 --> 03:02:10.20
I was in the parking lot of like right along the ocean just west of Golden Gate Park in San

2681
03:02:10.20 --> 03:02:11.20
Francisco.

2682
03:02:11.20 --> 03:02:12.68
They have you know parking for beach access.

2683
03:02:12.68 --> 03:02:14.96
And that was a start and endpoint.

2684
03:02:14.96 --> 03:02:16.96
And it was I don't know.

2685
03:02:16.96 --> 03:02:18.96
12 or 15 people were in that first class.

2686
03:02:18.96 --> 03:02:21.88
And where'd you advertise at Craig's List?

2687
03:02:21.88 --> 03:02:26.88
So we had a partnership with an event series called Tough Mudder.

2688
03:02:26.88 --> 03:02:31.56
And so we were actually meant to be the prequel to the Tough Mudder that was going

2689
03:02:31.56 --> 03:02:35.24
to happen in Lake Tahoe in that region.

2690
03:02:35.24 --> 03:02:39.000
Like a little fight club if you will that would then show up and do the Tough Mudder

2691
03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.48
together as a team there.

2692
03:02:41.48 --> 03:02:44.20
And it was something for them to talk about and it was obviously good for us.

2693
03:02:44.20 --> 03:02:51.52
So they had they had hit a home run on their first event, which was in May of.

2694
03:02:51.52 --> 03:02:55.32
Yeah, it was May of 2010 because that's we went to that as well.

2695
03:02:55.32 --> 03:03:00.68
Got together a bunch of my special forces buddies and put bricks in our rocks that we had

2696
03:03:00.68 --> 03:03:02.40
and went and did Tough Mudder together.

2697
03:03:02.40 --> 03:03:04.64
And it was sort of something to talk about.

2698
03:03:04.64 --> 03:03:06.000
And of course nobody bought anything.

2699
03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.000
We had inventory.

2700
03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.40
That's where I thought everyone was going to buy anything.

2701
03:03:08.40 --> 03:03:09.64
Nobody bought anything.

2702
03:03:09.64 --> 03:03:13.60
Like one person named Neil bought one rucksack at half off.

2703
03:03:13.60 --> 03:03:14.60
Right.

2704
03:03:14.60 --> 03:03:15.88
And so I almost got my money back.

2705
03:03:15.88 --> 03:03:17.88
So for the rock.

2706
03:03:17.88 --> 03:03:25.92
And it was just you know so anyway, we had kind of attached ourselves to a bigger organization.

2707
03:03:25.92 --> 03:03:31.84
And they drew we got a little bit of their press and so people showed up.

2708
03:03:31.84 --> 03:03:36.000
But the first one I actually had a really hustle to get people out there because it was just

2709
03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:37.48
a proof of concept.

2710
03:03:37.48 --> 03:03:38.48
And it was crazy.

2711
03:03:38.48 --> 03:03:42.40
This idea of unknown distance, unknown time, unpublished route and some special forces guys

2712
03:03:42.40 --> 03:03:44.56
going to put you through special forces style training.

2713
03:03:44.56 --> 03:03:46.08
That was the marketing.

2714
03:03:46.08 --> 03:03:48.56
And so that will speak to a certain kind of person.

2715
03:03:48.56 --> 03:03:50.72
The question becomes how do you reach them?

2716
03:03:50.72 --> 03:03:54.40
And you know, Tough Mudder certainly helped in that.

2717
03:03:54.40 --> 03:03:58.96
And then you know you get one person that signs up and they want to bring a body and that's

2718
03:03:58.96 --> 03:04:01.16
kind of how that worked.

2719
03:04:01.16 --> 03:04:06.60
And so did the first one and we went over Golden Gate Bridge and back and they wrote

2720
03:04:06.60 --> 03:04:11.52
around in the sand and did you know all that Navy Seale style stuff and the ocean that I

2721
03:04:11.52 --> 03:04:14.52
was less familiar with Ocean PT.

2722
03:04:14.52 --> 03:04:18.76
So you know there were a couple, you know, hey, I had to learn how to make sure they

2723
03:04:18.76 --> 03:04:22.44
locked arms when the serve was coming, right?

2724
03:04:22.44 --> 03:04:25.44
Like lock elbows and everybody making unbreakable chain.

2725
03:04:25.44 --> 03:04:28.12
Well that became sort of the teamwork part of it.

2726
03:04:28.12 --> 03:04:34.04
When we were done, we hung out in that parking lot and drank beer together for hours.

2727
03:04:34.04 --> 03:04:38.36
And everyone was just sort of had this huge smile on their face and you know, it brought

2728
03:04:38.36 --> 03:04:42.88
some peanut butter and jellies and people were eating that and drinking beer and everyone

2729
03:04:42.88 --> 03:04:43.88
was smiling.

2730
03:04:43.88 --> 03:04:46.76
And we were talking about how bad it sucked.

2731
03:04:46.76 --> 03:04:48.20
You know, and it was just awesome.

2732
03:04:48.20 --> 03:04:51.12
And it's like this is how we're going to build Go Ruck.

2733
03:04:51.12 --> 03:04:53.28
These are our people.

2734
03:04:53.28 --> 03:04:57.68
You know, the people that want to push a little harder, a little tougher demand a little

2735
03:04:57.68 --> 03:05:01.56
more and want to be around just have that sense of camaraderie.

2736
03:05:01.56 --> 03:05:03.16
Just push a little harder.

2737
03:05:03.16 --> 03:05:05.72
Find something hard and do it because it's hard.

2738
03:05:05.72 --> 03:05:08.68
It's very counter culture these days, right?

2739
03:05:08.68 --> 03:05:11.28
Everything is sold on being easy.

2740
03:05:11.28 --> 03:05:17.36
And you know, we build gear that's designed for the toughest situations on planet Earth,

2741
03:05:17.36 --> 03:05:18.64
like war.

2742
03:05:18.64 --> 03:05:24.000
And we put on events that are designed to challenge people and push them harder.

2743
03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.16
And now we have a lot of different events.

2744
03:05:26.16 --> 03:05:29.16
But at that time that was it.

2745
03:05:29.16 --> 03:05:34.60
And it sort of made the rounds and the people that did it, they told the people that they

2746
03:05:34.60 --> 03:05:38.20
thought, I know, because when you're done, you say, I know just the person that needs to

2747
03:05:38.20 --> 03:05:40.08
do this, right?

2748
03:05:40.08 --> 03:05:44.56
And so, you know, the next one was, again, a really small class, like six people in DC,

2749
03:05:44.56 --> 03:05:47.16
four of whom were personal friends of mine.

2750
03:05:47.16 --> 03:05:48.16
But it was about.

2751
03:05:48.16 --> 03:05:49.56
You wrote in two randoms, though.

2752
03:05:49.56 --> 03:05:50.56
Two randoms, right?

2753
03:05:50.56 --> 03:05:58.40
I mean, I probably, you know, in at that time, the price of the event was half the price

2754
03:05:58.40 --> 03:06:01.32
of the Rucksack and you got to keep the Rucksack.

2755
03:06:01.32 --> 03:06:04.000
So I'm making no money on any of this.

2756
03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.52
And I'm spending to travel and go places.

2757
03:06:06.52 --> 03:06:09.12
But you have to bet on yourself sometimes.

2758
03:06:09.12 --> 03:06:11.48
And you have to bet on something that you believe in.

2759
03:06:11.48 --> 03:06:17.76
And I felt it in my gut that it felt really good to give back to people, to show them,

2760
03:06:17.76 --> 03:06:23.40
not only what this bridge between the military and civilian worlds look like, but just as

2761
03:06:23.40 --> 03:06:30.44
individuals, how to push a little further in life in this small microcosm of special forces

2762
03:06:30.44 --> 03:06:31.44
training.

2763
03:06:31.44 --> 03:06:34.80
And, you know, that was very just rewarding.

2764
03:06:34.80 --> 03:06:36.40
So come what may.

2765
03:06:36.40 --> 03:06:37.40
This is what I want to do.

2766
03:06:37.40 --> 03:06:42.16
I don't want to sit in front of a computer and figure out how to do ad words.

2767
03:06:42.16 --> 03:06:43.48
I don't.

2768
03:06:43.48 --> 03:06:44.48
That's not.

2769
03:06:44.48 --> 03:06:46.000
I want to be out and use.

2770
03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.20
And I'm going to lose that fight.

2771
03:06:48.20 --> 03:06:53.08
I'm going to lose because there's people who, they just grew up on that stuff and they've

2772
03:06:53.08 --> 03:06:54.48
been doing it for forever.

2773
03:06:54.48 --> 03:06:58.76
And that's sort of fighting a war on their terms of business war.

2774
03:06:58.76 --> 03:07:01.12
Now I want to defy this on my terms.

2775
03:07:01.12 --> 03:07:04.52
And my terms were, I have this background.

2776
03:07:04.52 --> 03:07:08.84
And I can apply what I know and I can provide real value to people.

2777
03:07:08.84 --> 03:07:11.76
And if you're starting a business, think about that first.

2778
03:07:11.76 --> 03:07:17.16
Provide real value, get real feedback from people and follow that.

2779
03:07:17.16 --> 03:07:18.76
Do more of that.

2780
03:07:18.76 --> 03:07:20.60
And good things will happen.

2781
03:07:20.60 --> 03:07:25.20
And so there were some startup costs to this though, you know, traveling around and, you

2782
03:07:25.20 --> 03:07:32.56
know, the events were 12 and then 14 hours and, you know, they were really, really challenging

2783
03:07:32.56 --> 03:07:36.60
and every single time it was like a little fight club that happened.

2784
03:07:36.60 --> 03:07:42.92
And there was just a very passionate base that became the foundation for this go-rup community.

2785
03:07:42.92 --> 03:07:47.76
And if that would not have happened, I would have gone back and figured out how to serve

2786
03:07:47.76 --> 03:07:53.44
America in some other capacity, you know, ground branch or go back into the military or,

2787
03:07:53.44 --> 03:07:54.44
whatever.

2788
03:07:54.44 --> 03:07:55.68
I mean, that's what I wanted to do.

2789
03:07:55.68 --> 03:07:59.32
But I just got that sense of satisfaction from this.

2790
03:07:59.32 --> 03:08:03.48
So that you had your first event in 2010, how many events are planned roughly for

2791
03:08:03.48 --> 03:08:06.48
2010 years on?

2792
03:08:06.48 --> 03:08:09.48
So we have about a thousand events a year now.

2793
03:08:09.48 --> 03:08:13.000
And they're led by current and former special operations guys.

2794
03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:19.56
And so that means just, I mean, we have seals, green berets, delta guys, we have, you know,

2795
03:08:19.56 --> 03:08:25.60
PJs from the, the air, we have all, you know, we have forced reconnaissance Marines.

2796
03:08:25.60 --> 03:08:34.24
And what's important is empowering veterans to give back on the home front, because all

2797
03:08:34.24 --> 03:08:40.28
of us are united in this belief that we owe, we owe more.

2798
03:08:40.28 --> 03:08:49.32
We owe, you think back to the friends that you lost.

2799
03:08:49.32 --> 03:08:53.48
And when I say that I know for a fact in your head, you're thinking about them right now.

2800
03:08:53.48 --> 03:09:00.36
And you think that they died in service to our nation for values that we hold dear.

2801
03:09:00.36 --> 03:09:05.64
And what they wanted to do was to continue doing that for the rest of their lives.

2802
03:09:05.64 --> 03:09:07.68
That's what they wanted to do.

2803
03:09:07.68 --> 03:09:19.20
And so we honor their memory by continuing that mission as, as us and we get huge inspiration

2804
03:09:19.20 --> 03:09:21.52
by drawing upon the fact that we owe.

2805
03:09:21.52 --> 03:09:31.80
We just owe them and not just for their memory, but for our way of life and the generations

2806
03:09:31.80 --> 03:09:36.88
that will follow, because if we don't honor their memory, then we'll forget.

2807
03:09:36.88 --> 03:09:40.32
And not this doesn't mean just write it down and forget about it.

2808
03:09:40.32 --> 03:09:44.44
It means you have to live it and you have to talk about it and you have to share what

2809
03:09:44.44 --> 03:09:49.84
you've learned and you have to get out there with other people that maybe have not been exposed

2810
03:09:49.84 --> 03:09:51.20
to that.

2811
03:09:51.20 --> 03:09:58.64
And you have to, you have to show them what that, why that matters and why service is so important.

2812
03:09:58.64 --> 03:10:05.36
And for me, that the inspiration is the guys that I served with and that way of life that

2813
03:10:05.36 --> 03:10:06.72
they taught me.

2814
03:10:06.72 --> 03:10:11.12
And so everyone in our community has that.

2815
03:10:11.12 --> 03:10:17.76
We have that deep inside of ourselves and this is just an opportunity for those in our community

2816
03:10:17.76 --> 03:10:23.92
to build a bridge between the military and the civilian world and to get that feeling

2817
03:10:23.92 --> 03:10:28.000
of making a difference on the home front.

2818
03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.04
And so go rock became this bridge for me.

2819
03:10:31.04 --> 03:10:36.60
I was part of the building of this bridge along with the people who showed up for these events.

2820
03:10:36.60 --> 03:10:39.64
We were building it together, along with my dog.

2821
03:10:39.64 --> 03:10:45.32
And every, every event, I just, the well that was empty in my life, it just filled up a

2822
03:10:45.32 --> 03:10:46.72
little bit more.

2823
03:10:46.72 --> 03:10:51.88
And a little bit more and a little bit more because I gave back what I knew.

2824
03:10:51.88 --> 03:10:53.04
And people said thank you.

2825
03:10:53.04 --> 03:10:56.08
If someone says thank you, take them at their word.

2826
03:10:56.08 --> 03:10:58.32
You did something good.

2827
03:10:58.32 --> 03:10:59.32
Do more of that.

2828
03:10:59.32 --> 03:11:03.28
This doesn't have to be that hard.

2829
03:11:03.28 --> 03:11:08.88
And so that is something that we're just passionate about.

2830
03:11:08.88 --> 03:11:14.36
We put veterans as the face of our organization at all of these events all over the country

2831
03:11:14.36 --> 03:11:15.92
and the world.

2832
03:11:15.92 --> 03:11:19.76
And it's just, there's just a little bit of magic that happens.

2833
03:11:19.76 --> 03:11:24.84
And we're all, we're all strengthening and reinforcing that bridge.

2834
03:11:24.84 --> 03:11:31.24
And it's a very different thing than getting angry and talking about how different we are.

2835
03:11:31.24 --> 03:11:33.12
I just, I don't see it.

2836
03:11:33.12 --> 03:11:39.42
I see we literally don't care if you are young old black white male female gay straight

2837
03:11:39.42 --> 03:11:43.44
military civilian, pink purple, polka doted, striped, whatever.

2838
03:11:43.44 --> 03:11:44.44
Right?

2839
03:11:44.44 --> 03:11:48.64
So we go up and be a part of this team and do the work we want you on our team.

2840
03:11:48.64 --> 03:11:50.28
It's just that simple.

2841
03:11:50.28 --> 03:11:52.28
And there's something very liberating about that.

2842
03:11:52.28 --> 03:11:56.40
It's a political, it's, it's pure.

2843
03:11:56.40 --> 03:12:01.32
And that's what the military and it's best form represents.

2844
03:12:01.32 --> 03:12:03.72
There's just absolute purity.

2845
03:12:03.72 --> 03:12:08.04
It's, it's, to be a part of that is just, it's great.

2846
03:12:08.04 --> 03:12:15.04
And so to be able to lead that for others is just hugely rewarding.

2847
03:12:15.04 --> 03:12:17.48
Yeah, that's powerful.

2848
03:12:17.48 --> 03:12:21.000
I got another question for you.

2849
03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
Lessons learned wise.

2850
03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:26.24
How did you manage to get your wife back?

2851
03:12:26.24 --> 03:12:30.60
Yeah, that's a good one.

2852
03:12:30.60 --> 03:12:32.92
So what was it?

2853
03:12:32.92 --> 03:12:36.36
So I'm in, you took her dog.

2854
03:12:36.36 --> 03:12:37.36
I took her dog.

2855
03:12:37.36 --> 03:12:40.48
You're just batting like real low right now.

2856
03:12:40.48 --> 03:12:43.92
I was so, I was so, I was so, I got no job.

2857
03:12:43.92 --> 03:12:45.72
You're going to school.

2858
03:12:45.72 --> 03:12:47.40
You're, I mean, you took her dog.

2859
03:12:47.40 --> 03:12:50.12
All right, how did you manage to dig yourself out of that hole?

2860
03:12:50.12 --> 03:12:52.16
So I was so desperate to Emily.

2861
03:12:52.16 --> 03:12:55.48
She gave me her dog, right?

2862
03:12:55.48 --> 03:13:00.96
So she moved down to, she moved down to South America, got remarried.

2863
03:13:00.96 --> 03:13:04.28
Had a, had a daughter, Natalie, who, who lives with us now.

2864
03:13:04.28 --> 03:13:09.16
No visits her father, her father's in the military in Brazil.

2865
03:13:09.16 --> 03:13:11.24
So he's a Brazilian officer.

2866
03:13:11.24 --> 03:13:16.48
And, you know, I mean, that's just sort of what happened at that time.

2867
03:13:16.48 --> 03:13:20.24
But the chaos train continued a little bit for both of us.

2868
03:13:20.24 --> 03:13:23.72
And it was, it wasn't just easy.

2869
03:13:23.72 --> 03:13:26.04
It was just, it just wasn't easy.

2870
03:13:26.04 --> 03:13:31.64
And you know, I'm driving around with a dog to 48 states trying to start a backpack business

2871
03:13:31.64 --> 03:13:33.52
good luck, by the way.

2872
03:13:33.52 --> 03:13:34.52
It against all odds.

2873
03:13:34.52 --> 03:13:40.000
You know, and, you know, she fell in love, got remarried and had Natalie, who is just

2874
03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:41.84
the world's greatest big sister.

2875
03:13:41.84 --> 03:13:47.40
Now, because we have two other boys, or two boys, I should say, Jack and Ryan.

2876
03:13:47.40 --> 03:13:49.44
But so how did we get back together?

2877
03:13:49.44 --> 03:13:52.64
You know, we just kind of stayed in touch.

2878
03:13:52.64 --> 03:13:55.12
We were always friends.

2879
03:13:55.12 --> 03:14:03.36
And it wasn't some kind of, what happens when you make decisions in the moment is that

2880
03:14:03.36 --> 03:14:11.24
when there are big decisions and there are forks in the road and you go left or you go

2881
03:14:11.24 --> 03:14:13.88
right or one of you goes left and one of you goes right.

2882
03:14:13.88 --> 03:14:18.68
I mean, eventually you will get perspective on your own decisions.

2883
03:14:18.68 --> 03:14:21.36
And you have to come to terms with that.

2884
03:14:21.36 --> 03:14:30.40
And the thing that I really try to avoid in life at all costs are regrets.

2885
03:14:30.40 --> 03:14:33.04
And I just, I don't, I think that's what I'm talking about.

2886
03:14:33.04 --> 03:14:40.04
If think about what I regret this with either my time or my effort or energy, whatever,

2887
03:14:40.04 --> 03:14:45.08
before, this is fast-forwarding to just sort of business or life or whatever decisions.

2888
03:14:45.08 --> 03:14:46.96
But at that time, you know, I don't know.

2889
03:14:46.96 --> 03:14:48.60
I really don't know what it was.

2890
03:14:48.60 --> 03:14:53.12
I remember she wanted to see Java because she was back in America one time.

2891
03:14:53.12 --> 03:14:59.64
So we met and I saw her and we had Java and it's like, we're crying again.

2892
03:14:59.64 --> 03:15:05.56
I mean, it's just the love never really dies.

2893
03:15:05.56 --> 03:15:07.88
I mean, you you fall in love with someone.

2894
03:15:07.88 --> 03:15:12.92
I hear these stories, you know, you love someone and then you hate them because whatever.

2895
03:15:12.92 --> 03:15:15.52
I'm, that's not my story, right?

2896
03:15:15.52 --> 03:15:20.08
My story is we were really good friends for a really long time.

2897
03:15:20.08 --> 03:15:27.72
And we hope that our strategy of having this fairytale ending skip to the end with these

2898
03:15:27.72 --> 03:15:31.48
chaotic, crazy lives, which then the plane was I was going to join the agency where we're

2899
03:15:31.48 --> 03:15:34.08
going to be a tandem couple and the agency.

2900
03:15:34.08 --> 03:15:37.56
And that didn't happen, of course, right?

2901
03:15:37.56 --> 03:15:39.60
But we stayed in touch, Soljava.

2902
03:15:39.60 --> 03:15:46.76
And then at some point, she was, she sent me a handwritten letter, which is a really, you

2903
03:15:46.76 --> 03:15:50.36
know, it's one of those things that if you want to get someone's attention in a very

2904
03:15:50.36 --> 03:15:57.28
busy world, send them something that you've actually written by hand, it implies a degree

2905
03:15:57.28 --> 03:16:01.36
of time and thoughtfulness and all these things.

2906
03:16:01.36 --> 03:16:02.76
And so we traded a couple notes.

2907
03:16:02.76 --> 03:16:07.64
It's not like if it's just radio silence, but she sent me a note and it was just like

2908
03:16:07.64 --> 03:16:12.40
I'm moving back to America and I would love to see you.

2909
03:16:12.40 --> 03:16:13.76
There's probably more to it.

2910
03:16:13.76 --> 03:16:14.76
I don't want to.

2911
03:16:14.76 --> 03:16:18.04
You know, it was, it was complicated.

2912
03:16:18.04 --> 03:16:24.80
But you know, I mean, and then we saw each other and it just kind of clicked again.

2913
03:16:24.80 --> 03:16:33.64
Like the love came back and the love never left, but it was, I don't know, Jocca was just

2914
03:16:33.64 --> 03:16:34.64
magic.

2915
03:16:34.64 --> 03:16:36.68
It was just magic.

2916
03:16:36.68 --> 03:16:45.12
And it's just one of those things where the surprising thing I guess was that, you know,

2917
03:16:45.12 --> 03:16:47.76
she had gotten remarried and she got divorced, right?

2918
03:16:47.76 --> 03:16:51.24
And then we got back together and, you know, I had not moved on.

2919
03:16:51.24 --> 03:16:58.04
I mean, I had dated other people and I wasn't really ready to really move on.

2920
03:16:58.04 --> 03:17:00.80
I had not gotten over her by any stretch.

2921
03:17:00.80 --> 03:17:06.36
And so that kind of held me back in lots of other things, especially the love department

2922
03:17:06.36 --> 03:17:08.80
of life.

2923
03:17:08.80 --> 03:17:11.44
But I also was very skeptical.

2924
03:17:11.44 --> 03:17:18.36
I didn't really want to just throw myself back into what our relationship was in 2008

2925
03:17:18.36 --> 03:17:21.36
in 2009.

2926
03:17:21.36 --> 03:17:24.36
So it took time after that.

2927
03:17:24.36 --> 03:17:27.000
It was actually work.

2928
03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:30.84
We had to talk about stuff and get stuff out there, imagine that.

2929
03:17:30.84 --> 03:17:35.72
Like if you're going to get remarried to your ex-wife, you got some work to do, right?

2930
03:17:35.72 --> 03:17:41.64
And you know, now we have two boys and she works at GoRuck as well.

2931
03:17:41.64 --> 03:17:48.32
It's not some perfect life that everyone thinks that everyone else has because nothing

2932
03:17:48.32 --> 03:17:49.32
is perfect.

2933
03:17:49.32 --> 03:17:52.000
But we're really happy.

2934
03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.20
Awesome.

2935
03:17:54.20 --> 03:17:59.40
One last thing I wanted to ask you about is the, I know you and I kind of linked up to

2936
03:17:59.40 --> 03:18:05.68
begin with through Ryan Manion and the Travis Manion Foundation.

2937
03:18:05.68 --> 03:18:15.72
What's, how are you tied in to supporting that unbelievable cause in memory of Travis?

2938
03:18:15.72 --> 03:18:18.40
Yeah, so that was one of those situations.

2939
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:23.40
It was one of the easiest, some things in life are really hard and you've got to do them.

2940
03:18:23.40 --> 03:18:26.68
Some things that are hard in life you should not do cause there's probably other things

2941
03:18:26.68 --> 03:18:28.56
that you could spend more time on.

2942
03:18:28.56 --> 03:18:35.72
This was one of those situations where they do at their core the very same thing in so

2943
03:18:35.72 --> 03:18:36.72
many ways, right?

2944
03:18:36.72 --> 03:18:39.96
They empower veterans to give back, right?

2945
03:18:39.96 --> 03:18:42.40
They operate from this assumption of we, we owe.

2946
03:18:42.40 --> 03:18:45.88
We owe and let's be servant leaders and let's get out into the community.

2947
03:18:45.88 --> 03:18:48.48
Let's be more physically active, let's build communities.

2948
03:18:48.48 --> 03:18:56.12
Let's show the next generation what our values are and let's allow them and afford them

2949
03:18:56.12 --> 03:18:59.44
the opportunity to become servant leaders themselves.

2950
03:18:59.44 --> 03:19:02.92
And so our community basically linked us up.

2951
03:19:02.92 --> 03:19:10.48
I mean there was a Heather who works at Travis Manion Foundation was doing GoRuck events

2952
03:19:10.48 --> 03:19:16.68
and TMF for Travis Manion Foundation was putting on these heroes runs over 9-11 every

2953
03:19:16.68 --> 03:19:24.72
year to get people and bring them together in honor of their cause, right?

2954
03:19:24.72 --> 03:19:28.24
And so it just kind of happened.

2955
03:19:28.24 --> 03:19:31.96
I mean the communities they're doing service projects, we have communities the communities

2956
03:19:31.96 --> 03:19:36.28
just sort of aligned and then we partnered officially on these 9-11 heroes runs and turn

2957
03:19:36.28 --> 03:19:40.08
them into rocks or runs or rocks, whatever.

2958
03:19:40.08 --> 03:19:48.04
But it's about bringing people together and raising awareness and spreading goodwill around

2959
03:19:48.04 --> 03:19:49.04
the veteran space.

2960
03:19:49.04 --> 03:19:54.88
And so we had been working together as partners on this stuff and service stuff at the

2961
03:19:54.88 --> 03:19:59.68
community level, ground up long before I'd ever met Ryan.

2962
03:19:59.68 --> 03:20:04.40
So since then I've gotten to spend a lot of time with her.

2963
03:20:04.40 --> 03:20:07.40
We just rocked the Marine Corps of Marathon together which was awesome.

2964
03:20:07.40 --> 03:20:09.56
Yeah, it was great.

2965
03:20:09.56 --> 03:20:12.52
You spend some time with someone doing something hard, you get to know them and it's

2966
03:20:12.52 --> 03:20:13.52
great.

2967
03:20:13.52 --> 03:20:19.16
You develop a bond and that's, you can't get it if you don't do something hard to together.

2968
03:20:19.16 --> 03:20:24.16
So that was great and we just share a lot of the same values and so you know they're

2969
03:20:24.16 --> 03:20:30.000
part of our vessel for fundraising and for getting people out and getting people active

2970
03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:31.88
and aligning around a cause.

2971
03:20:31.88 --> 03:20:38.60
And one of the things that I love about her story and the story of Travis Manion Foundation

2972
03:20:38.60 --> 03:20:45.08
is that she goes Travis would hate the fact that we've called this organization the

2973
03:20:45.08 --> 03:20:50.96
Travis Manion Foundation because you know, she's like, it's not about me, right?

2974
03:20:50.96 --> 03:20:55.72
That's the sort of way of life that you live and you really do live it when you serve

2975
03:20:55.72 --> 03:20:59.88
in these kinds of communities in the military.

2976
03:20:59.88 --> 03:21:05.96
And so there are other things that they say of these last five words that he said before

2977
03:21:05.96 --> 03:21:10.04
his or these five words he said before he deployed on his last deployment to Iraq was

2978
03:21:10.04 --> 03:21:12.000
if not me even who.

2979
03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:16.000
And you know, the way he said it, it wasn't really a question.

2980
03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:20.84
It was just, I'm going to go because this is what I'm trying to do and if not me then

2981
03:21:20.84 --> 03:21:22.04
they're going to send someone else.

2982
03:21:22.04 --> 03:21:23.04
That's why I'm going.

2983
03:21:23.04 --> 03:21:27.40
This is my mission America sending me and these are the values I hold dear.

2984
03:21:27.40 --> 03:21:30.28
I'm going to go forth and go.

2985
03:21:30.28 --> 03:21:36.48
And so my, I've kind of the idea that now his kind of cross to bear if you will sit

2986
03:21:36.48 --> 03:21:41.68
up talking to the big guy upstairs is if not me then who, at minus ball be my name on the

2987
03:21:41.68 --> 03:21:48.36
organization to represent this sort of veteran space and trying to get more of us out there

2988
03:21:48.36 --> 03:21:52.92
to raise awareness and to really empower the next generation as well.

2989
03:21:52.92 --> 03:21:59.52
And so we're just so aligned that it's such an easy rewarding partnership for us.

2990
03:21:59.52 --> 03:22:00.52
Yeah, awesome.

2991
03:22:00.52 --> 03:22:07.96
No, it's just so awesome to have Ryan on this podcast and hear everything about the

2992
03:22:07.96 --> 03:22:09.36
foundation, what they're doing.

2993
03:22:09.36 --> 03:22:15.48
I did like a video that they present to schools for kids, you know, talking about discipline

2994
03:22:15.48 --> 03:22:17.12
and integrity and leadership.

2995
03:22:17.12 --> 03:22:22.08
And so they're just getting the word out there and I appreciate that you guys are helping

2996
03:22:22.08 --> 03:22:23.76
spread that word as well.

2997
03:22:23.76 --> 03:22:26.28
So that's awesome.

2998
03:22:26.28 --> 03:22:32.76
Well, we're looking at a little over three hours right now.

2999
03:22:32.76 --> 03:22:34.52
You made this really easy.

3000
03:22:34.52 --> 03:22:36.20
The website is go rock.com.

3001
03:22:36.20 --> 03:22:37.20
Exactly.

3002
03:22:37.20 --> 03:22:44.28
The Facebook, the Twitter, the Instagram, the YouTube channel, it's all at go rock and

3003
03:22:44.28 --> 03:22:48.96
people can find you, people can participate in these thousand events you got coming up.

3004
03:22:48.96 --> 03:22:52.40
What do they do just go on where do you sign up?

3005
03:22:52.40 --> 03:22:57.40
So it's also on the website.

3006
03:22:57.40 --> 03:22:59.40
You'll see a lot of gear and stuff as well.

3007
03:22:59.40 --> 03:23:01.80
That's the other part of what we do.

3008
03:23:01.80 --> 03:23:03.60
It's kind of complicated like that.

3009
03:23:03.60 --> 03:23:06.24
It's really like a fitness thing with backpacks though.

3010
03:23:06.24 --> 03:23:07.96
We manufacture gear.

3011
03:23:07.96 --> 03:23:09.88
You've got this rucksack or this backpack.

3012
03:23:09.88 --> 03:23:11.24
You can do a lot with it.

3013
03:23:11.24 --> 03:23:18.16
So yeah, there's a lot of events and nobody wanted the name go rock except for us.

3014
03:23:18.16 --> 03:23:20.92
So all of our social media stuff is go rock.

3015
03:23:20.92 --> 03:23:22.52
Oh yeah, yeah, that's that.

3016
03:23:22.52 --> 03:23:23.52
That's exactly.

3017
03:23:23.52 --> 03:23:29.04
Except there was this Hungarian photographer early on whose name was like go rock.

3018
03:23:29.04 --> 03:23:30.04
Go rock.

3019
03:23:30.04 --> 03:23:36.76
And so he had the Twitter handle and I pestered him forever and eventually he canceled

3020
03:23:36.76 --> 03:23:39.16
his account and then that triggered all these other things.

3021
03:23:39.16 --> 03:23:40.64
Eventually we claimed it.

3022
03:23:40.64 --> 03:23:43.96
We're not hugely on the Twitter space, but it's everything's go rock.

3023
03:23:43.96 --> 03:23:44.96
That's awesome.

3024
03:23:44.96 --> 03:23:48.000
Ecker, you got anything?

3025
03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:50.76
Yeah, what kind of dog is job?

3026
03:23:50.76 --> 03:23:53.84
So job was a chocolate lab.

3027
03:23:53.84 --> 03:23:55.56
He passed away in 2013.

3028
03:23:55.56 --> 03:24:00.32
It was one of those situations where we had this really big event.

3029
03:24:00.32 --> 03:24:06.88
We'd done an obstacle course race out in Virginia, like a confidence course.

3030
03:24:06.88 --> 03:24:13.80
I mean, wood trees with nets and stuff and you know, balance walks and all this stuff.

3031
03:24:13.80 --> 03:24:17.72
And it was our first venture into that as a way to get people out there.

3032
03:24:17.72 --> 03:24:21.64
I mean, I'd never doing that again because it was just too labor intensive.

3033
03:24:21.64 --> 03:24:28.20
But Java got really sick right before that and spent a lot of time and I slept on the floor

3034
03:24:28.20 --> 03:24:34.44
at the vet's office in Northern Virginia for like two weeks.

3035
03:24:34.44 --> 03:24:36.84
It became really good friends with Heather who was the veterinarian.

3036
03:24:36.84 --> 03:24:40.52
They're still a really close personal friend of mine.

3037
03:24:40.52 --> 03:24:44.000
But he was basically diagnosed as bi-exclusion.

3038
03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:49.80
It just got some autoimmune disease like Lupus and I just watched him with her away to nothing.

3039
03:24:49.80 --> 03:24:52.76
And so that's the sad part of the story.

3040
03:24:52.76 --> 03:24:53.76
It comes to all of us.

3041
03:24:53.76 --> 03:24:57.72
You just have to kind of deal with it.

3042
03:24:57.72 --> 03:24:58.72
And then we got monster.

3043
03:24:58.72 --> 03:25:02.40
So if you go to our site or you see pictures now, most of them are of monster.

3044
03:25:02.40 --> 03:25:04.60
He's also an English chocolate lab.

3045
03:25:04.60 --> 03:25:06.44
So he's got this kind of blockhead.

3046
03:25:06.44 --> 03:25:08.32
And those two dogs they look kind of similar.

3047
03:25:08.32 --> 03:25:11.52
But monster is literally the nicest dog ever.

3048
03:25:11.52 --> 03:25:15.88
I mean Java was kind of had those fangs at the ready and the great protector.

3049
03:25:15.88 --> 03:25:22.16
And monster just he'll roll over on his back with all four paws in the air and just

3050
03:25:22.16 --> 03:25:26.08
no predator to that dog exists whatsoever.

3051
03:25:26.08 --> 03:25:29.80
And life's a funny place like that sometimes.

3052
03:25:29.80 --> 03:25:30.80
They're both great.

3053
03:25:30.80 --> 03:25:33.16
They're just complete opposite.

3054
03:25:33.16 --> 03:25:34.16
Right all.

3055
03:25:34.16 --> 03:25:35.16
Anything else echo?

3056
03:25:35.16 --> 03:25:36.16
No man.

3057
03:25:36.16 --> 03:25:37.16
That's it.

3058
03:25:37.16 --> 03:25:38.16
Good to meet you.

3059
03:25:38.16 --> 03:25:39.16
Thanks so much for having me guys.

3060
03:25:39.16 --> 03:25:40.80
I've been this been fun.

3061
03:25:40.80 --> 03:25:42.12
Yeah man, anything else?

3062
03:25:42.12 --> 03:25:43.12
Any closing thoughts?

3063
03:25:43.12 --> 03:25:44.12
Anything we missed.

3064
03:25:44.12 --> 03:25:46.96
I least on this round.

3065
03:25:46.96 --> 03:25:49.000
You tell me you got any big advice for me?

3066
03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.000
I'm sure you dug in to go rock and you've seen sort of our stuff with a fresh set of

3067
03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:54.000
eyes.

3068
03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:56.16
You do a lot of business consulting.

3069
03:25:56.16 --> 03:25:57.28
You solve a lot of problems.

3070
03:25:57.28 --> 03:25:59.68
You've seen a lot of leaders along the way.

3071
03:25:59.68 --> 03:26:03.52
I mean, what do you see of what we're doing and what are we doing well and what could

3072
03:26:03.52 --> 03:26:04.52
be doing better?

3073
03:26:04.52 --> 03:26:08.76
I think what you're doing well and what I'm glad that you already figured out is like

3074
03:26:08.76 --> 03:26:14.48
you're focused on helping people out and you're exposing them to, I don't know if I

3075
03:26:14.48 --> 03:26:18.32
want to call it a form of exercise because it's really a lot more than that.

3076
03:26:18.32 --> 03:26:21.88
You know, going out on a rough hump like I said, I've talked about it before.

3077
03:26:21.88 --> 03:26:23.28
It had a big impact on my life.

3078
03:26:23.28 --> 03:26:24.76
It has a big impact on the way.

3079
03:26:24.76 --> 03:26:27.000
I think about things in general.

3080
03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:32.04
So I think the fact that you're taking something that helped you and is opening the doors

3081
03:26:32.04 --> 03:26:33.08
to a lot of people.

3082
03:26:33.08 --> 03:26:35.76
I don't think there's a better business plan than that man.

3083
03:26:35.76 --> 03:26:38.80
So keep getting after it is what I always say.

3084
03:26:38.80 --> 03:26:39.80
All right.

3085
03:26:39.80 --> 03:26:40.80
We'll keep getting after it.

3086
03:26:40.80 --> 03:26:41.80
Thanks.

3087
03:26:41.80 --> 03:26:45.48
Thanks for helping out the TMF, the Travis, Travis, Manion, Foundation.

3088
03:26:45.48 --> 03:26:48.28
That's awesome.

3089
03:26:48.28 --> 03:26:50.60
Of course, thanks for your service man.

3090
03:26:50.60 --> 03:26:51.60
I appreciate it.

3091
03:26:51.60 --> 03:26:52.60
Likewise, Jocca.

3092
03:26:52.60 --> 03:26:53.60
Thanks for what you're doing.

3093
03:26:53.60 --> 03:26:55.76
We'll talk to you later.

3094
03:26:55.76 --> 03:27:04.000
And with that, Jason has left the building and while Jason has left the building, I'm

3095
03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:05.72
going to be entering.

3096
03:27:05.72 --> 03:27:11.40
Some buildings around America, speaking to people.

3097
03:27:11.40 --> 03:27:15.28
Yes, going on tour.

3098
03:27:15.28 --> 03:27:17.72
All right, live gigs.

3099
03:27:17.72 --> 03:27:25.32
If you want to come, January 6, Washington, DC, January 11, Austin, already sold out.

3100
03:27:25.32 --> 03:27:32.92
Sorry, January 16, New York, January 20th, LA, January 27th.

3101
03:27:32.92 --> 03:27:40.68
And then January 27th, Seattle, and January 28th, San Fran, Cisco.

3102
03:27:40.68 --> 03:27:53.12
So looking at the maps of the assorted event venues, they are one in sold out.

3103
03:27:53.12 --> 03:27:59.28
Like I said, Austin, the other ones are in the process of selling out.

3104
03:27:59.28 --> 03:28:07.68
So if you want to come, jump on there, go to joccolive.com and get yourself some tickets

3105
03:28:07.68 --> 03:28:09.88
to come, hang out.

3106
03:28:09.88 --> 03:28:12.64
I'm going to talk.

3107
03:28:12.64 --> 03:28:13.64
Echo is going to be there.

3108
03:28:13.64 --> 03:28:14.64
Some of them.

3109
03:28:14.64 --> 03:28:15.64
I think that's what we're planning.

3110
03:28:15.64 --> 03:28:17.32
Yeah, we're sorting that out.

3111
03:28:17.32 --> 03:28:18.64
Maybe all of them.

3112
03:28:18.64 --> 03:28:20.88
Maybe some of them.

3113
03:28:20.88 --> 03:28:24.000
Not none of them.

3114
03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:28.88
For people that like Echo, hopefully it's one of the ones that you're going to.

3115
03:28:28.88 --> 03:28:33.64
For those people that don't like Echo, there are people out there like that.

3116
03:28:33.64 --> 03:28:35.48
I believe so, yes.

3117
03:28:35.48 --> 03:28:38.60
If you don't like Echo, well, you're all right.

3118
03:28:38.60 --> 03:28:43.000
You can still come.

3119
03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:44.000
And all right.

3120
03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:49.16
So we talked a lot about rocking, which we've talked about before, certainly a good way

3121
03:28:49.16 --> 03:28:52.000
to make yourself better.

3122
03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:53.68
Not the only way.

3123
03:28:53.68 --> 03:28:55.64
There are some other ways to make yourself better.

3124
03:28:55.64 --> 03:29:02.28
There's ways to provide yourself support while you're actually supporting what we're

3125
03:29:02.28 --> 03:29:03.28
doing here.

3126
03:29:03.28 --> 03:29:05.28
Kind of this whole thing.

3127
03:29:05.28 --> 03:29:06.68
Yeah, it's true.

3128
03:29:06.68 --> 03:29:07.68
Echo Charles.

3129
03:29:07.68 --> 03:29:08.68
Hey, you know how.

3130
03:29:08.68 --> 03:29:09.68
Rocking.

3131
03:29:09.68 --> 03:29:11.96
Like, you know what I think about rocking is in the airport.

3132
03:29:11.96 --> 03:29:16.64
To me, when I think of rocking and you, I think you have no idea what this is.

3133
03:29:16.64 --> 03:29:17.64
Just like, do.

3134
03:29:17.64 --> 03:29:22.60
Because my camera bag is pretty heavy and then my computer bag is pretty heavy.

3135
03:29:22.60 --> 03:29:24.04
It's heavy and then we're going to compute a bag.

3136
03:29:24.04 --> 03:29:25.52
Well, my computer is kind of heavy.

3137
03:29:25.52 --> 03:29:26.52
Because big.

3138
03:29:26.52 --> 03:29:28.52
Even though it only has four terabyte drive.

3139
03:29:28.52 --> 03:29:29.52
Yes.

3140
03:29:29.52 --> 03:29:30.52
Yeah.

3141
03:29:30.52 --> 03:29:31.52
Week.

3142
03:29:31.52 --> 03:29:34.28
Anyway, that's still a heavy computer for I'm saying.

3143
03:29:34.28 --> 03:29:38.56
So when you carry the camera bag and the computer bag when you travel, you walk from terminal

3144
03:29:38.56 --> 03:29:42.28
to terminal, going in, you know, to all these different gates.

3145
03:29:42.28 --> 03:29:43.28
This is it.

3146
03:29:43.28 --> 03:29:44.68
You basically ran through the special forces.

3147
03:29:44.68 --> 03:29:45.68
Good course.

3148
03:29:45.68 --> 03:29:46.96
This is what I'm hearing.

3149
03:29:46.96 --> 03:29:47.96
Pretty much.

3150
03:29:47.96 --> 03:29:48.96
It's what I'm saying.

3151
03:29:48.96 --> 03:29:49.96
That's what I'm hearing.

3152
03:29:49.96 --> 03:29:54.56
And, hey, man, I don't know how a real rock feels.

3153
03:29:54.56 --> 03:29:55.40
I don't.

3154
03:29:55.40 --> 03:29:57.72
I was thinking, like, you'd have no idea what we're talking about.

3155
03:29:57.72 --> 03:30:04.04
We might as well be talking about, you know, walking around on Mars in low gravity or

3156
03:30:04.04 --> 03:30:06.04
whatever gravity they have on Mars.

3157
03:30:06.04 --> 03:30:07.04
Yeah.

3158
03:30:07.04 --> 03:30:08.04
So I don't know.

3159
03:30:08.04 --> 03:30:09.04
I'll walk around on the moon with low gravity.

3160
03:30:09.04 --> 03:30:11.44
Like, this is, I can imagine what it's like, but I have no idea.

3161
03:30:11.44 --> 03:30:12.44
I disagree.

3162
03:30:12.44 --> 03:30:15.64
Because when I walk around with that, it's like a little, like, workout.

3163
03:30:15.64 --> 03:30:16.64
So they don't want to do this.

3164
03:30:16.64 --> 03:30:17.64
So I was right.

3165
03:30:17.64 --> 03:30:18.64
You kind of know what it's like.

3166
03:30:18.64 --> 03:30:22.40
It's just my mind, like, where it's like, hey, this isn't really a workout.

3167
03:30:22.40 --> 03:30:24.40
It's a workout, but it's not the workout.

3168
03:30:24.40 --> 03:30:31.40
Echo Charles special forces to push the elevator via carry on luggage.

3169
03:30:31.40 --> 03:30:32.40
Yes, sir.

3170
03:30:32.40 --> 03:30:34.24
And it's very true.

3171
03:30:34.24 --> 03:30:37.68
Because I'm just trying to get from point A to point B.

3172
03:30:37.68 --> 03:30:39.64
Are you going to start a company called GoLugged?

3173
03:30:39.64 --> 03:30:41.64
Who are you?

3174
03:30:41.64 --> 03:30:44.40
Go carry luggage around an airport for a workout?

3175
03:30:44.40 --> 03:30:45.40
Anyway.

3176
03:30:45.40 --> 03:30:46.40
This one.

3177
03:30:46.40 --> 03:30:48.08
I know exactly what's going on.

3178
03:30:48.08 --> 03:30:49.08
But it's exactly.

3179
03:30:49.08 --> 03:30:50.08
Exactly.

3180
03:30:50.08 --> 03:30:51.88
You say you know exactly what's going on.

3181
03:30:51.88 --> 03:30:52.88
Well, even that exactly.

3182
03:30:52.88 --> 03:30:57.04
But it's like, you know, like that you could, you could isolate that as a work.

3183
03:30:57.04 --> 03:31:00.12
Because like when he's talking, oh, yes, actually I do know what's going on.

3184
03:31:00.12 --> 03:31:04.36
Because when he explained how it feels to take off like the rocks back when you're done,

3185
03:31:04.36 --> 03:31:05.88
I was like, bro, you're talking about me.

3186
03:31:05.88 --> 03:31:07.52
You're talking about me when you get.

3187
03:31:07.52 --> 03:31:10.92
So you were, you were a backpack.

3188
03:31:10.92 --> 03:31:11.92
Yes, sir.

3189
03:31:11.92 --> 03:31:15.64
For, let's call it seven minutes as you get through there.

3190
03:31:15.64 --> 03:31:19.56
And then you finally get after that treacherous journey.

3191
03:31:19.56 --> 03:31:23.16
You get to your first class seat on the airplane.

3192
03:31:23.16 --> 03:31:25.12
You get to unload that burden.

3193
03:31:25.12 --> 03:31:26.12
Oh, yeah.

3194
03:31:26.12 --> 03:31:27.40
You feel like you'd go back to your job.

3195
03:31:27.40 --> 03:31:30.24
And then the girl comes over and says, would you like a champagne?

3196
03:31:30.24 --> 03:31:31.24
Sure.

3197
03:31:31.24 --> 03:31:32.24
No, man.

3198
03:31:32.24 --> 03:31:33.60
I'm too busy rocking.

3199
03:31:33.60 --> 03:31:34.84
So you know, basically, right.

3200
03:31:34.84 --> 03:31:36.60
I think I think that's the SFQ course.

3201
03:31:36.60 --> 03:31:37.60
It's the same thing.

3202
03:31:37.60 --> 03:31:38.60
I think that's Ranger School.

3203
03:31:38.60 --> 03:31:39.60
You just completed.

3204
03:31:39.60 --> 03:31:41.000
Anyway, I'm doing you, Jitsu.

3205
03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:43.000
I don't know what you changed the subject.

3206
03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:45.64
Well, that's all.

3207
03:31:45.64 --> 03:31:48.56
And sometimes I'll do it with a rock sack on.

3208
03:31:48.56 --> 03:31:49.84
You do Jitsu with a rock sack on.

3209
03:31:49.84 --> 03:31:51.76
If you had a rock sack on, did you do it?

3210
03:31:51.76 --> 03:31:55.16
If you, if the rock sack was like stream lined, I don't

3211
03:31:55.16 --> 03:31:58.32
know like how, but I mean, they get, there's varying levels of bulk.

3212
03:31:58.32 --> 03:31:59.32
Right.

3213
03:31:59.32 --> 03:32:00.32
I mean, this levels.

3214
03:32:00.32 --> 03:32:01.32
Yeah.

3215
03:32:01.32 --> 03:32:03.76
But if you had a stream lined, rock sack, do you

3216
03:32:03.76 --> 03:32:05.76
do you do to might, it might benefit you?

3217
03:32:05.76 --> 03:32:07.56
Because you get used to the weight?

3218
03:32:07.56 --> 03:32:08.72
You do, you see the weight, sure.

3219
03:32:08.72 --> 03:32:11.40
But no, no, no, no, as far as like performance goes because you'd be heavier on

3220
03:32:11.40 --> 03:32:16.12
them to go, like they couldn't really stay on your back.

3221
03:32:16.12 --> 03:32:17.12
You see what I'm saying?

3222
03:32:17.12 --> 03:32:18.12
Sure.

3223
03:32:18.12 --> 03:32:20.000
Yeah, it's kind of unrealistic.

3224
03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.60
But the last, I do do Jitsu.

3225
03:32:22.60 --> 03:32:25.08
And you know, I don't wear a rock sack most of the time, I wear a

3226
03:32:25.08 --> 03:32:26.08
gear.

3227
03:32:26.08 --> 03:32:27.08
Some of the time.

3228
03:32:27.08 --> 03:32:28.08
How about I?

3229
03:32:28.08 --> 03:32:29.08
Where do you get your gear from?

3230
03:32:29.08 --> 03:32:30.60
Origin, so you got origin made.com.

3231
03:32:30.60 --> 03:32:33.68
What is important about origin, why?

3232
03:32:33.68 --> 03:32:35.40
Well, depends on who you are.

3233
03:32:35.40 --> 03:32:40.68
But in my opinion, what significant and significantly important is that

3234
03:32:40.68 --> 03:32:44.36
they're made in America.

3235
03:32:44.36 --> 03:32:48.36
Okay, the main America sounds cool, I appreciate it.

3236
03:32:48.36 --> 03:32:50.68
But what if we want high quality?

3237
03:32:50.68 --> 03:32:51.68
Yes, same deal.

3238
03:32:51.68 --> 03:32:55.36
So I was going to say the second most significant thing is the main American, the high

3239
03:32:55.36 --> 03:32:57.64
quality, that's the first most significant thing.

3240
03:32:57.64 --> 03:33:00.32
That's what I was going to say.

3241
03:33:00.32 --> 03:33:06.36
So origin made.com, get your gear, get your rash guards, get your t-shirts, and by

3242
03:33:06.36 --> 03:33:14.12
the way, since we can't walk around America, wearing gear, pants, you can get a pair

3243
03:33:14.12 --> 03:33:15.12
of origin jeans.

3244
03:33:15.12 --> 03:33:23.76
Same deal, made in America, from the materials, raw materials, raw materials, right?

3245
03:33:23.76 --> 03:33:24.76
Yeah, like the cotton.

3246
03:33:24.76 --> 03:33:25.76
What?

3247
03:33:25.76 --> 03:33:26.76
The cotton.

3248
03:33:26.76 --> 03:33:33.92
Whatever, you were talking to somebody and you said it like the, you said cotton to

3249
03:33:33.92 --> 03:33:37.72
to, to, no, no, you were, I don't know if you're imitating me.

3250
03:33:37.72 --> 03:33:40.36
I was 100% because otherwise they were not f-t-s.

3251
03:33:40.36 --> 03:33:41.36
No, I was not f-t-s.

3252
03:33:41.36 --> 03:33:44.88
But it wasn't cotton, it was but it, you said but the same thing.

3253
03:33:44.88 --> 03:33:47.88
I'm just doing that, I'm just imitating you.

3254
03:33:47.88 --> 03:33:49.28
Whatever, that's your jam now.

3255
03:33:49.28 --> 03:33:51.32
So go ahead, run with it, I think.

3256
03:33:51.32 --> 03:33:54.16
Anyway, jeans, yes, good jeans too.

3257
03:33:54.16 --> 03:33:57.12
Not just some red, like, junk jeans, they're good.

3258
03:33:57.12 --> 03:34:00.56
Turn them inside out like pizzas and look at the quality on the inside.

3259
03:34:00.56 --> 03:34:03.48
These aren't normal jeans, these are the best jeans in the world.

3260
03:34:03.48 --> 03:34:04.72
That's, that's where I'm going to say.

3261
03:34:04.72 --> 03:34:05.72
Okay.

3262
03:34:05.72 --> 03:34:10.60
And also we have a lighter weight jeans that are out right now.

3263
03:34:10.60 --> 03:34:12.28
These are close to being out.

3264
03:34:12.28 --> 03:34:13.28
They're cold.

3265
03:34:13.28 --> 03:34:14.92
They're not the 68.

3266
03:34:14.92 --> 03:34:17.52
But I have them, they're out for me, they've been out for a while.

3267
03:34:17.52 --> 03:34:18.92
So they're one pair out there.

3268
03:34:18.92 --> 03:34:21.16
No, no, they're, they're in production for sure.

3269
03:34:21.16 --> 03:34:22.76
That's 100%.

3270
03:34:22.76 --> 03:34:27.96
So if you want to get a pair that's a little lighter weight, it's weird too, right?

3271
03:34:27.96 --> 03:34:30.12
Because here I am, Mr. Heavyweight hoodie.

3272
03:34:30.12 --> 03:34:31.12
Sure.

3273
03:34:31.12 --> 03:34:32.12
But I like lightweight jeans.

3274
03:34:32.12 --> 03:34:33.76
I guess that's the way things are good.

3275
03:34:33.76 --> 03:34:34.76
Shake out sometimes.

3276
03:34:34.76 --> 03:34:39.84
The only times I've been cold, how many times I've ever been in my life, said,

3277
03:34:39.84 --> 03:34:41.84
Oh, my legs are cold.

3278
03:34:41.84 --> 03:34:42.84
I don't know.

3279
03:34:42.84 --> 03:34:43.84
I'm zero.

3280
03:34:43.84 --> 03:34:45.84
Never.

3281
03:34:45.84 --> 03:34:46.84
All right.

3282
03:34:46.84 --> 03:34:47.84
Well, yeah.

3283
03:34:47.84 --> 03:34:50.84
I mean, it kind of makes sense if you look at it practically because if you're going

3284
03:34:50.84 --> 03:34:54.84
to be in a situation where the weather and the temperature is this thing, you're not going

3285
03:34:54.84 --> 03:34:58.84
to be like, yeah, let me get my heavyweight clothes, but not my pants.

3286
03:34:58.84 --> 03:35:01.84
Like it just doesn't make sense like that, seem sane.

3287
03:35:01.84 --> 03:35:09.28
So anytime where it's like a temperature dictated scenario, you never really have the opportunity

3288
03:35:09.28 --> 03:35:10.28
to have your legs cold.

3289
03:35:10.28 --> 03:35:11.28
Seems sane.

3290
03:35:11.28 --> 03:35:12.28
Hmm, sure.

3291
03:35:12.28 --> 03:35:14.28
Like if you're going to mind it, yeah.

3292
03:35:14.28 --> 03:35:15.28
Point taken.

3293
03:35:15.28 --> 03:35:16.28
Point taken.

3294
03:35:16.28 --> 03:35:17.28
Yeah, it's going to top.

3295
03:35:17.28 --> 03:35:18.28
So it's like cool.

3296
03:35:18.28 --> 03:35:19.28
That's cool and everything, but.

3297
03:35:19.28 --> 03:35:21.28
So I really didn't say much.

3298
03:35:21.28 --> 03:35:22.28
You didn't say much, I agree.

3299
03:35:22.28 --> 03:35:28.28
Well, we got lightweight jeans, Delta 68 named after my four fathers and the

3300
03:35:28.28 --> 03:35:36.28
Seal teams who wore jeans in the maycon, Delta, and now I'm also supplements by the way.

3301
03:35:36.28 --> 03:35:39.26
Which I did, I did the jeans, but until they come out,

3302
03:35:39.26 --> 03:35:44.26
you know, I can't get too emotionally moved by it.

3303
03:35:44.26 --> 03:35:48.96
Unless supplements I can because these supplements are, as it turns out, the most important

3304
03:35:48.96 --> 03:35:57.76
supplements that there are for your joints, joint warfare and superkrill oil, cold war by the way,

3305
03:35:57.76 --> 03:36:00.66
which is really put it in work recently.

3306
03:36:00.66 --> 03:36:04.94
My son is sick, so you know, I'm using this a lot.

3307
03:36:04.94 --> 03:36:10.94
They're called war to prevent and head off any sicknesses that might be coming your way.

3308
03:36:10.94 --> 03:36:11.94
Immunity supplement.

3309
03:36:11.94 --> 03:36:12.94
Yes.

3310
03:36:12.94 --> 03:36:13.94
As it were.

3311
03:36:13.94 --> 03:36:16.94
Also, mock additional protein in the form of a dessert.

3312
03:36:16.94 --> 03:36:18.94
Just stick with that one.

3313
03:36:18.94 --> 03:36:24.94
Ready to drink discipline go in a can.

3314
03:36:24.94 --> 03:36:27.94
Tropic Thunder.

3315
03:36:27.94 --> 03:36:28.94
Citrus.

3316
03:36:28.94 --> 03:36:29.94
We got that's kind of mine.

3317
03:36:29.94 --> 03:36:31.94
My go to is psychocetrus.

3318
03:36:31.94 --> 03:36:37.94
It's sort of like a lemon lime, tropic thunder's kind of like a pineapple coconut.

3319
03:36:37.94 --> 03:36:40.94
And then of course we have dac savage.

3320
03:36:40.94 --> 03:36:42.94
Is that your personal favorite?

3321
03:36:42.94 --> 03:36:43.94
A little bit, but yes.

3322
03:36:43.94 --> 03:36:47.94
So there's not a huge margin of favor to his close close close.

3323
03:36:47.94 --> 03:36:53.94
Did you see Dakota posted on his Instagram account, which I know you refer to that as the

3324
03:36:53.94 --> 03:37:03.94
video.

3325
03:37:03.94 --> 03:37:06.94
But he posted like he just got, I don't know, like an entire palette of dac savage to his house.

3326
03:37:06.94 --> 03:37:08.94
Because Dakota's not playing around.

3327
03:37:08.94 --> 03:37:12.94
But yeah, yeah, first and then close second is a tropical.

3328
03:37:12.94 --> 03:37:14.94
I don't forget about jocquawaiti.

3329
03:37:14.94 --> 03:37:16.94
If you need to improve your deadlift.

3330
03:37:16.94 --> 03:37:18.94
I mean, yeah, taste good.

3331
03:37:18.94 --> 03:37:19.94
Yeah, it's certified organic.

3332
03:37:19.94 --> 03:37:21.94
Yeah, it's got a little caffeine.

3333
03:37:21.94 --> 03:37:24.94
But let's face it. You're getting that for that 8,000 pound deadlift.

3334
03:37:24.94 --> 03:37:25.94
Gears, tromb.

3335
03:37:25.94 --> 03:37:27.94
And strawberry and chocolate.

3336
03:37:27.94 --> 03:37:29.94
Warrior kid mook.

3337
03:37:29.94 --> 03:37:35.94
Oh, what if you came home and you're like, oh, well, what do you want to give your kid to eat right now?

3338
03:37:35.94 --> 03:37:36.94
How about poison?

3339
03:37:36.94 --> 03:37:37.94
No, no, no poison.

3340
03:37:37.94 --> 03:37:38.94
No one says that.

3341
03:37:38.94 --> 03:37:45.94
And yet they give their kids sugar, filled, desserts, treats, snacks.

3342
03:37:45.94 --> 03:37:46.94
Thontions.

3343
03:37:46.94 --> 03:37:48.94
Whatever those are.

3344
03:37:48.94 --> 03:37:49.94
Thontions.

3345
03:37:49.94 --> 03:37:51.94
I kind of do, but I don't think I liked them.

3346
03:37:51.94 --> 03:37:55.94
For real. Yeah, they were kind of, that was like a love hates scenario for sure.

3347
03:37:55.94 --> 03:37:58.94
Yeah. Well, anyways, don't give your kids any of that stuff.

3348
03:37:58.94 --> 03:37:59.94
Wouldn't want something tasty.

3349
03:37:59.94 --> 03:38:01.94
Give them some warrior kid mook.

3350
03:38:01.94 --> 03:38:05.94
Also, jocquawaiti store. It's called jocquaw store.

3351
03:38:05.94 --> 03:38:06.94
Jocquaw store.com.

3352
03:38:06.94 --> 03:38:07.94
JP Denel.

3353
03:38:07.94 --> 03:38:09.94
Shout out, by the way.

3354
03:38:09.94 --> 03:38:13.94
He was, well, you know, doing his workout.

3355
03:38:13.94 --> 03:38:16.94
Apparently he posted a picture of postwork out.

3356
03:38:16.94 --> 03:38:18.94
Posted a picture of postwork out.

3357
03:38:18.94 --> 03:38:19.94
Mm-hmm.

3358
03:38:19.94 --> 03:38:21.94
Picture.

3359
03:38:21.94 --> 03:38:24.94
Waring one of the mini shirts.

3360
03:38:24.94 --> 03:38:26.94
Oh, the new.

3361
03:38:26.94 --> 03:38:27.94
He was a new deaf shirt.

3362
03:38:27.94 --> 03:38:28.94
There was the new deaf shirts.

3363
03:38:28.94 --> 03:38:31.94
And there was also the light weight hoodie scenario.

3364
03:38:31.94 --> 03:38:33.94
So he's just getting after him.

3365
03:38:33.94 --> 03:38:34.94
He's getting after him.

3366
03:38:34.94 --> 03:38:35.94
And represents.

3367
03:38:35.94 --> 03:38:36.94
Wait, is he on the path?

3368
03:38:36.94 --> 03:38:37.94
He's on the path.

3369
03:38:37.94 --> 03:38:39.94
So he's representing wallets on the path.

3370
03:38:39.94 --> 03:38:40.94
What?

3371
03:38:40.94 --> 03:38:41.94
Exactly.

3372
03:38:41.94 --> 03:38:42.94
What are you doing?

3373
03:38:42.94 --> 03:38:43.94
That is JP.

3374
03:38:43.94 --> 03:38:45.94
But someone did ask, hey, where do you get that?

3375
03:38:45.94 --> 03:38:49.94
So, you know, we said every week, sure.

3376
03:38:49.94 --> 03:38:50.94

So yeah.

3412
03:39:35.94 --> 03:39:35.94

3416
03:39:41.94 --> 03:39:43.94
I'm not like, I'm not going to sit here.

3417
03:39:43.94 --> 03:39:47.94
You don't think that someone's on podcast 208.

3418
03:39:47.94 --> 03:39:51.94
And they've, there's for the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of us talking.

3420
03:39:54.94 --> 03:39:55.94
Yeah.

3421
03:39:55.94 --> 03:40:04.94
Um, I don't know, but it's possible or it's possible that maybe someone just had stumbled upon podcasts in general.

3422
03:40:04.94 --> 03:40:05.94
Oh, you see.

3423
03:40:05.94 --> 03:40:06.94
Yep.

3424
03:40:06.94 --> 03:40:07.94
Is that possible?

3425
03:40:07.94 --> 03:40:09.94
I sat next to a woman on the plane.

3426
03:40:09.94 --> 03:40:10.94
Sure.

3427
03:40:10.94 --> 03:40:12.94
And she was older than me.

3428
03:40:12.94 --> 03:40:19.94
And she asked me something and somehow she asked what I was doing because I was like preparing something.

3429
03:40:19.94 --> 03:40:20.94
Sure.

3430
03:40:20.94 --> 03:40:24.94
And I said, all I'm writing this for a podcast and she goes, oh, and I said,

3431
03:40:24.94 --> 03:40:26.94
Do you know what podcast are?

3432
03:40:26.94 --> 03:40:28.94
She did like that.

3433
03:40:28.94 --> 03:40:29.94
I said that.

3434
03:40:29.94 --> 03:40:31.94
Did she say, of course?

3435
03:40:31.94 --> 03:40:33.94
She goes, oh, which she goes, of course.

3436
03:40:33.94 --> 03:40:34.94
I know what a podcast is.

3437
03:40:34.94 --> 03:40:37.94
She said, I'm not that old.

3438
03:40:37.94 --> 03:40:39.94
And I said, I know you're not.

3439
03:40:39.94 --> 03:40:40.94
I said, but a lot of people don't know.

3440
03:40:40.94 --> 03:40:43.94
And by the way, I said, I'm probably older than you.

3441
03:40:43.94 --> 03:40:46.94
And she said, there's zero chance that you're older than me.

3442
03:40:46.94 --> 03:40:47.94
Uh-huh.

3443
03:40:47.94 --> 03:40:48.94
But where do you?

3444
03:40:48.94 --> 03:40:49.94
No, I was not.

3445
03:40:49.94 --> 03:40:51.94
Or your scared task.

3446
03:40:51.94 --> 03:40:54.94
Uh, actually, she told me her age.

3447
03:40:54.94 --> 03:40:56.94
And she's older than me.

3448
03:40:56.94 --> 03:40:57.94
She was older than me.

3449
03:40:57.94 --> 03:40:58.94
All right. Well, there you go.

3450
03:40:58.94 --> 03:40:59.94
But here's the thing.

3451
03:40:59.94 --> 03:41:01.94
You really didn't gain much information because it's not like you.

3452
03:41:01.94 --> 03:41:03.94
You said, you know, a podcast are.

3453
03:41:03.94 --> 03:41:04.94
You gotta ask her.

3454
03:41:04.94 --> 03:41:06.94
Do you know whether or not to subscribe?

3455
03:41:06.94 --> 03:41:08.94
Do you know that it's possible to subscribe to podcast?

3456
03:41:08.94 --> 03:41:11.94
So that you know what I did? I took her phone.

3457
03:41:11.94 --> 03:41:14.94
And I showed her, darkle podcast.

3458
03:41:14.94 --> 03:41:15.94
I was like, you're running out.

3459
03:41:15.94 --> 03:41:17.94
And I press subscribe for her.

3460
03:41:17.94 --> 03:41:19.94
Because she's already in the kind of in the game.

3461
03:41:19.94 --> 03:41:21.94
Yeah. She was interested in what was happening.

3462
03:41:21.94 --> 03:41:22.94
Yeah, man.

3463
03:41:22.94 --> 03:41:23.94
Now she's in the game fully.

3464
03:41:23.94 --> 03:41:26.94
And either way, whether she knew the subscriber not, she subscribed.

3465
03:41:26.94 --> 03:41:29.94
But the question still remains.

3466
03:41:29.94 --> 03:41:33.94
Does everyone know about podcast and the subscription option?

3467
03:41:33.94 --> 03:41:35.94
If you don't know to subscribe, then subscribe.

3468
03:41:35.94 --> 03:41:40.94
And also, you may not have been aware because this was probably the worst launch in the

3469
03:41:40.94 --> 03:41:42.94
history of launches randomly.

3470
03:41:42.94 --> 03:41:47.94
Maybe it was a big effort to make impact in the world.

3471
03:41:47.94 --> 03:41:49.94
We have another podcast, which is called a grounded.

3472
03:41:49.94 --> 03:41:54.94
And we talk about casual things of life, including Jiu Jitsu and not so casual things.

3473
03:41:54.94 --> 03:42:00.94
But it's a little bit not quite as heavy or structured or.

3474
03:42:00.94 --> 03:42:04.94
Yeah, as this podcast, it's called the grounded podcast.

3475
03:42:04.94 --> 03:42:06.94
You can subscribe to that one too.

3476
03:42:06.94 --> 03:42:09.94
You can also subscribe to War Your Kid podcast.

3477
03:42:09.94 --> 03:42:11.94
There's going to be some new ones coming out.

3478
03:42:11.94 --> 03:42:12.94
It's weird.

3479
03:42:12.94 --> 03:42:15.94
The worst was in that kid sent me a letter that said,

3480
03:42:15.94 --> 03:42:18.94
I'm wondering why you don't make more podcast.

3481
03:42:18.94 --> 03:42:19.94
That one hit me right.

3482
03:42:19.94 --> 03:42:20.94
It's hard.

3483
03:42:20.94 --> 03:42:21.94
Yeah.

3484
03:42:21.94 --> 03:42:23.94
And don't forget about War Your Kid soap.

3485
03:42:23.94 --> 03:42:26.94
Go to IrishOxRanch.com.

3486
03:42:26.94 --> 03:42:28.94
Eden is up there making soap.

3487
03:42:28.94 --> 03:42:30.94
And we got a new soap coming out by the way.

3488
03:42:30.94 --> 03:42:31.94
What's going to be out there?

3489
03:42:31.94 --> 03:42:32.94
You want to know what it's called?

3490
03:42:32.94 --> 03:42:33.94
Yes, sir.

3491
03:42:33.94 --> 03:42:35.94
It's called killer soap.

3492
03:42:35.94 --> 03:42:38.94
It's called killer soap.

3493
03:42:38.94 --> 03:42:40.94
Is it anti-bacterial or anti-bacterial?

3494
03:42:40.94 --> 03:42:41.94
Anti-bacterial?

3495
03:42:41.94 --> 03:42:41.94
Anti-bacterial?

3496
03:42:41.94 --> 03:42:43.94
My Crombrial?

3497
03:42:43.94 --> 03:42:44.94
Yeah.

3498
03:42:44.94 --> 03:42:45.94
T-tree oils.

3499
03:42:45.94 --> 03:42:46.94
See, that's good.

3500
03:42:46.94 --> 03:42:48.94
Activated charcoal.

3501
03:42:48.94 --> 03:42:52.94
So it's going to be coming out to check out that killer soap.

3502
03:42:52.94 --> 03:42:53.94
That's a good one, actually.

3503
03:42:53.94 --> 03:42:56.94
This is make me a marketing genius as the question.

3504
03:42:56.94 --> 03:42:57.94
Kind of.

3505
03:42:57.94 --> 03:42:59.94
You're kind of looking like it was a marketing genius, bro.

3506
03:42:59.94 --> 03:43:00.94
I think it's a good product.

3507
03:43:00.94 --> 03:43:03.94
We'll say that. You conveyed that message very clearly.

3508
03:43:03.94 --> 03:43:04.94
So yeah, I guess so.

3509
03:43:04.94 --> 03:43:05.94
Genius.

3510
03:43:05.94 --> 03:43:06.94
Well, you know, maybe you know.

3511
03:43:06.94 --> 03:43:07.94
No.

3512
03:43:07.94 --> 03:43:08.94
What would you have called it?

3513
03:43:08.94 --> 03:43:11.94
Something lame is what I'm feeling.

3514
03:43:11.94 --> 03:43:13.94
Anyway.

3515
03:43:13.94 --> 03:43:15.94
We have a YouTube channel.

3516
03:43:15.94 --> 03:43:16.94
How about that?

3517
03:43:16.94 --> 03:43:17.94
That's marketing genius.

3518
03:43:17.94 --> 03:43:18.94
Yes, what?

3519
03:43:18.94 --> 03:43:19.94
YouTube channel.

3520
03:43:19.94 --> 03:43:20.94
Videos of the thing.

3521
03:43:20.94 --> 03:43:21.94
No, it's right.

3522
03:43:21.94 --> 03:43:22.94
Marketing guy.

3523
03:43:22.94 --> 03:43:22.94
Right.

3524
03:43:22.94 --> 03:43:23.94
Video.

3525
03:43:23.94 --> 03:43:24.94
It's a good addition.

3526
03:43:24.94 --> 03:43:26.94
For instance, if someone's listening to this podcast,

3527
03:43:26.94 --> 03:43:28.94
and they want to see what Jason looks like.

3528
03:43:28.94 --> 03:43:31.94
They can go on there and they can see what Jason looks like.

3529
03:43:31.94 --> 03:43:32.94
They can also see what I look like.

3530
03:43:32.94 --> 03:43:34.94
And in fact, they can see what you look like.

3531
03:43:34.94 --> 03:43:35.94
Sure.

3532
03:43:35.94 --> 03:43:38.94
Which most people don't think you look like what you sound like.

3533
03:43:38.94 --> 03:43:40.94
That's what I've heard.

3534
03:43:40.94 --> 03:43:41.94
That's the consensus.

3535
03:43:41.94 --> 03:43:41.94
Yeah.

3536
03:43:41.94 --> 03:43:43.94
Don't be worried about it, bro.

3537
03:43:43.94 --> 03:43:44.94
I'm not worried.

3538
03:43:44.94 --> 03:43:45.94
All good.

3539
03:43:45.94 --> 03:43:46.94
Wait.

3540
03:43:46.94 --> 03:43:51.94
Would you prefer to have the current scenario, which is you sound

3541
03:43:51.94 --> 03:43:55.94
small, weak in frail.

3542
03:43:55.94 --> 03:43:58.94
And then you're actually kind of jacked.

3543
03:43:58.94 --> 03:44:00.94
Would your brother sound like this is your coach,

3544
03:44:00.94 --> 03:44:02.94
but then you were skinny and weak.

3545
03:44:02.94 --> 03:44:03.94
Yeah.

3546
03:44:03.94 --> 03:44:04.94
Besides your knees.

3547
03:44:04.94 --> 03:44:08.94
Well, I think the answer is obvious,

3548
03:44:08.94 --> 03:44:12.94
or would I rather look how it will look?

3549
03:44:12.94 --> 03:44:14.94
Because this is the knock on how I sound really.

3550
03:44:14.94 --> 03:44:16.94
So technically the dichotomy,

3551
03:44:16.94 --> 03:44:18.94
or the other side of the dichotomy,

3552
03:44:18.94 --> 03:44:19.94
would be like,

3553
03:44:19.94 --> 03:44:22.94
would I rather sound?

3554
03:44:22.94 --> 03:44:23.94
Yeah, yeah.

3555
03:44:23.94 --> 03:44:26.94
Would you rather sound big and look small?

3556
03:44:26.94 --> 03:44:30.94
Or look big and sound small?

3557
03:44:30.94 --> 03:44:32.94
Because that's kind of what would you rather.

3558
03:44:32.94 --> 03:44:33.94
You're good with where you're going.

3559
03:44:33.94 --> 03:44:34.94
I'm good at where we're at.

3560
03:44:34.94 --> 03:44:35.94
Yeah.

3561
03:44:35.94 --> 03:44:36.94

3562
03:44:36.94 --> 03:44:37.94

Enhanced videos and Mikey in the Dragons,

3566
03:44:46.94 --> 03:44:49.94
which is a children's book that I wrote that Jon Bow's

3567
03:44:49.94 --> 03:44:50.94
acted the artwork for.

3568
03:44:50.94 --> 03:44:53.94
We just posted the entire thing,

3569
03:44:53.94 --> 03:44:56.94
cover the cover on YouTube,

3570
03:44:56.94 --> 03:45:01.94
so that kids around the world can watch and learn

3571
03:45:01.94 --> 03:45:03.94
how to overcome fear.

3572
03:45:03.94 --> 03:45:04.94
Yeah.

3573
03:45:04.94 --> 03:45:06.94
My kids love that video by the way.

3574
03:45:06.94 --> 03:45:07.94
Yeah.

3575
03:45:07.94 --> 03:45:09.94
This is an awesome, even sense before we post it.

3576
03:45:09.94 --> 03:45:10.94
Yeah, that's good.

3577
03:45:10.94 --> 03:45:11.94
It's very good.

3578
03:45:11.94 --> 03:45:12.94
Psychological warfare.

3579
03:45:12.94 --> 03:45:15.94
Got a little out-mouth in it has tracks.

3580
03:45:15.94 --> 03:45:17.94
And if you have a little moment where you're like,

3581
03:45:17.94 --> 03:45:20.94
man, I wish Jocker would just kind of like give me a little

3582
03:45:20.94 --> 03:45:23.94
talk right now, get me in the game.

3583
03:45:23.94 --> 03:45:24.94
That's what it is.

3584
03:45:24.94 --> 03:45:26.94
You think you're going to not,

3585
03:45:26.94 --> 03:45:27.94
you think you're not going to work out.

3586
03:45:27.94 --> 03:45:28.94
You think you're going to lay in bed.

3587
03:45:28.94 --> 03:45:31.94
You think you're going to grab all of that, don't I?

3588
03:45:31.94 --> 03:45:32.94
No, I'm going to stop you.

3589
03:45:32.94 --> 03:45:34.94
Just press play on your, on your,

3590
03:45:34.94 --> 03:45:37.94
listening device.

3591
03:45:37.94 --> 03:45:38.94
And listen to that MP3.

3592
03:45:38.94 --> 03:45:41.94
You can get that on an MP3 dealer.

3593
03:45:41.94 --> 03:45:44.94
iTunes, Google Play Stitcher, whatever,

3594
03:45:44.94 --> 03:45:47.94
whatever, leave reviews.

3595
03:45:47.94 --> 03:45:48.94
Actually, it's not Stitcher.

3596
03:45:48.94 --> 03:45:49.94
It's iTunes, Google Play.

3597
03:45:49.94 --> 03:45:51.94
Whatever, MP3 platforms don't forget about

3598
03:45:51.94 --> 03:45:52.94
Flipside Canvas.

3599
03:45:52.94 --> 03:45:58.94
Maybe you need a visual kind of a visual reinforcement of the path.

3600
03:45:58.94 --> 03:45:58.94
Cool.

3601
03:45:58.94 --> 03:46:02.94
Go to flipside Canvas.com, which is run by my brother Dakota Meyer.

3602
03:46:02.94 --> 03:46:11.94
And you can get yourself some graphic representation of what we call the path.

3603
03:46:11.94 --> 03:46:12.94
Yes, sir.

3604
03:46:12.94 --> 03:46:16.94
You can see that all of this is going to be a real problem.

3605
03:46:16.94 --> 03:46:18.94
And you know, keep you on it.

3606
03:46:18.94 --> 03:46:19.94
Got some books.

3607
03:46:19.94 --> 03:46:21.94
Got leadership strategy and tactics field manual.

3608
03:46:21.94 --> 03:46:23.94
Preorder it now.

3609
03:46:23.94 --> 03:46:27.94
So that the publisher knows how many to print because otherwise,

3610
03:46:27.94 --> 03:46:28.94
they're over there,

3611
03:46:28.94 --> 03:46:30.94
rounded down.

3612
03:46:30.94 --> 03:46:30.94
Right?

3613
03:46:30.94 --> 03:46:32.94
They're like, well, we probably will get away with this.

3614
03:46:32.94 --> 03:46:35.94
No, they don't understand.

3615
03:46:35.94 --> 03:46:37.94
Let them understand.

3616
03:46:37.94 --> 03:46:38.94
Preorder it.

3617
03:46:38.94 --> 03:46:40.94
Get one for you.

3618
03:46:40.94 --> 03:46:44.38
get one for each of the people on your team, get one for your

3619
03:46:44.38 --> 03:46:48.18
bug, get some leadership strategy and tactics, feel manual.

3620
03:46:48.18 --> 03:46:52.46
All the little questions that we have about leadership are in here,

3621
03:46:52.46 --> 03:46:55.82
indexed heavily so you can look through the index,

3622
03:46:55.82 --> 03:46:58.86
making an ultimatum as the boss.

3623
03:46:58.86 --> 03:47:02.54
Hmm, making an ultimatum as a subordinate.

3624
03:47:02.54 --> 03:47:05.58
Okay, those are interesting, right?

3625
03:47:05.58 --> 03:47:09.18
Dealing with an ultimatum placed on you.

3626
03:47:09.18 --> 03:47:13.18
That's these are these are important things to know and understand.

3627
03:47:13.18 --> 03:47:16.54
Balancing praise, that sounds like a good idea.

3628
03:47:16.54 --> 03:47:17.98
Tackfully delivering the truth.

3629
03:47:17.98 --> 03:47:21.26
I'm just looking to giving clear guidance,

3630
03:47:21.26 --> 03:47:22.70
keeping the troops informed.

3631
03:47:22.70 --> 03:47:26.94
So these are all punishment.

3632
03:47:26.94 --> 03:47:31.10
How to meet out punishment.

3633
03:47:31.10 --> 03:47:31.74
You like that.

3634
03:47:31.74 --> 03:47:33.50
You made that little video of this.

3635
03:47:33.50 --> 03:47:34.30
Right.

3636
03:47:34.30 --> 03:47:35.10
That's the for the bug.

3637
03:47:35.10 --> 03:47:36.06
Yeah, of me saying,

3638
03:47:36.06 --> 03:47:39.98
what do I punish people?

3639
03:47:39.98 --> 03:47:40.62
So that's good.

3640
03:47:40.62 --> 03:47:42.38
Leadership strategy and tactics,

3641
03:47:42.38 --> 03:47:43.02

If I would have had these books,

3646
03:47:52.06 --> 03:47:53.66
when I was a kid, my life would have been better.

3647
03:47:53.66 --> 03:47:55.74
And that's a bold statement.

3648
03:47:55.74 --> 03:47:57.58
So way of the Warrior Kid,

3649
03:47:57.58 --> 03:48:00.06

3650
03:48:00.06 --> 03:48:03.58
free where there's a will get your kid on the path.

3651
03:48:03.58 --> 03:48:06.22
Look, I know you want them on the path,

3652
03:48:06.22 --> 03:48:09.90
but it's hard when you're a parent because your kids don't really want to listen to you.

3653
03:48:09.90 --> 03:48:10.78
They don't.

3654
03:48:10.78 --> 03:48:12.54
They'll listen to Uncle Jake though.

3655
03:48:12.54 --> 03:48:15.66
For some reason, they'll listen to Uncle Jake.

3656
03:48:15.66 --> 03:48:17.90
So get the most books and then Mikey in the Dragons.

3657
03:48:17.90 --> 03:48:18.78

03:48:19.42 --> 03:48:19.58
Cool.

3660
03:48:19.58 --> 03:48:22.94
We put it on YouTube for free, obviously.

3661
03:48:22.94 --> 03:48:27.02
But what you can do is you get your kids the book and then they can read along.

3662
03:48:27.02 --> 03:48:28.46
And they learn to read.

3663
03:48:28.46 --> 03:48:32.62
They learn to read while they learn to overcome fear.

3664
03:48:32.62 --> 03:48:33.50
You're welcome.

3665
03:48:33.50 --> 03:48:36.62

not always the most efficient way.

3691
03:49:43.50 --> 03:49:45.26

3731
03:52:18.30 --> 03:52:26.54
And on top of those two, I want to also give credit to our intelligence community out there in America

3732
03:52:26.54 --> 03:52:35.66
and overseas doing work to keep us safe, taking the fight to the enemy by knowing and understanding

3733
03:52:35.66 --> 03:52:37.50
who they are and what they do.

3734
03:52:37.50 --> 03:52:47.50
And to everyone else out there, things aren't always going to go the way that you think they will.

3735
03:52:48.94 --> 03:52:54.30
There will be challenges and there will be obstacles and there will be unexpected problems.

3736
03:52:54.30 --> 03:52:59.34
And you will sometimes have to carry more weight than you want to.

3737
03:53:00.70 --> 03:53:03.98
You might have to carry more weight than you think you can.

3738
03:53:03.98 --> 03:53:14.06
And when that happens, remember to take that weight, take it on your shoulders, stand up, put one foot

3739
03:53:14.06 --> 03:53:18.06
in front of the other and keep getting after it.

3740
03:53:18.06 --> 03:53:38.14
And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
