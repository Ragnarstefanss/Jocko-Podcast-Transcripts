1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Jockelpontcast number 156.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, I come, good evening.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Resistance. Why didn't you resist?

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today, those who have continued to live on and comfort,

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
scald those who suffered.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes, resistance should have begun right there

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at the moment of the arrest itself.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it did not begin.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
During a daylight arrest,

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
there is always that brief and unique moment

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when they are leading you,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
either inconspicuously on the basis of a cowardly deal you have made

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or else quite openly their pistols unholstered

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
through a crowd of hundreds of just such doomed innocence

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
as yourself.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You aren't gagged.

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You really can and you really ought to cry out

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to cry out you are being arrested.

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That villains in disguise are trapping people

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that arrest are being made on the strength of false denunciations.

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That millions are being subjected to silent reprisals.

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If many such outcry has been heard all over the city

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in the course of a day,

25
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
would not our fellow citizens perhaps have begun to bristle?

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And would arrest,

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
perhaps no longer have been so easy?

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Instead,

29
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
not one sound comes from your parched lips.

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And that passing crowd naively believes that you and your executioners

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
are friends out for a stroll.

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I myself often had the chance to cry out.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So, why did I keep silent?

34
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Why, in my last minute,

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
out in the open did I not attempt to enlighten the hood-winked crowd?

36
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Why did I keep silent?

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Every man always has a dozen glid little reasons

38
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
why he is right, not to sacrifice himself.

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Some still have hopes of a favorable outcome to their case

40
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and are afraid to ruin their chances by outcry.

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So they keep silent.

42
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And that right there is part of the opening of book one,

43
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of the book, The Glug, Arkapelago,

44
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
by Solchonitson.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And I discussed it on the last podcast with Jordan Peterson.

46
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But I didn't dig into the actual text very much because,

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
well, I had Jordan Peterson on here,

48
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and I would rather just talk with him and allow him to talk

49
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
rather than read and delve into the text itself.

50
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But the text is really good.

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I wanted to take today to go through,

52
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
at least, well, to go through today, part one of the Gulag Arkapelago.

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And the version that I'm going through is not the abridged version,

54
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but the full, unabridged version.

55
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So, if you end up looking for some of these passages in the abridged version,

56
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you might not find them.

57
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I'm only going to go through part one today.

58
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And maybe over time we'll go through all seven parts

59
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that are in three different volumes, massive volumes,

60
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
by the way, this one is 600 pages long.

61
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Part two volume two, it looks like about another 600 pages,

62
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and then volume three looks to be, I don't know, maybe four or 500 pages.

63
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So, I think we're talking maybe 1500 to 2000 pages,

64
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
but it's a great read.

65
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And like I said in the future,

66
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
if you get these, I'll say this.

67
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In the future, yes, we will go through all the books.

68
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So, if you want to get them now and read them,

69
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
then eventually you'll be able to roll through them with us.

70
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And it's, as I said,

71
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I mean, this book is a very powerful book,

72
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but I said this one when I was talking to Jordan,

73
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it's written and you can hear from even the opening there.

74
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It's almost a conversation.

75
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's a very conversational writing that socialness and does.

76
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And so it's pretty easy to read, because it's not,

77
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
it's just very, it sounds like somebody's telling you a story

78
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
is basically what it's like.

79
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
He's asking you questions, rhetorical questions.

80
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
He's interacting with you the reader.

81
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So it's a pretty fun read.

82
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It's not fun in the fact that you're reading about people

83
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
being trapped, tortured, murdered in a goolog,

84
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
but he does it in a light-hearted way,

85
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
if that's possible.

86
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Is that possible?

87
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I don't know if it's possible, but he seems to pull it off.

88
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I mean, you can even see just what I just read.

89
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You can see he's having a conversation with you about it.

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You know, he's having a conversation.

91
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So that's what it's like,

92
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
let's go back to the book and I'm going to pick up

93
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in a section where he's kind of explaining.

94
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I talked about this with Jordan.

95
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And by the way, yeah, so if you haven't listened to one

96
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
55 with Jordan Peterson, where we discuss some of this,

97
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
some of the ideas in this,

98
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but we don't delve into the book too much.

99
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And I'm actually going to cover those parts

100
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
or two little sections that we covered.

101
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm going to cover them again today and kind of go in a little bit more.

102
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But if you haven't listened to one 55,

103
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
let's listen to one 55,

104
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and then come back and listen to this one.

105
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This section of the book,

106
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Solskja Nitsen is talking about the fact that he's a war hero

107
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
for all practical purposes.

108
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And he's about to get rolled up and arrested by his brigade commander.

109
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And he's talking about his brigade commander

110
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and the situation that he's now going into.

111
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
10 days before,

112
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I had led my own reconnaissance battery

113
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
almost intact out of the fire pocket

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in which the 12 heavy guns of his artillery battalion had been left.

115
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And now he had to renounce me

116
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because of a piece of paper with a seal on it.

117
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I knew instantly I had been arrested because of my correspondence

118
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
with a school friend and understood

119
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
from what direction to expect danger.

120
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So he's been a fire pocket,

121
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
if you don't know what that means,

122
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
he was surrounded by the enemy.

123
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And he was able to lead his troops out of their almost intact,

124
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
which means they took some casualties,

125
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
maybe lost some guys,

126
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
but he was able to lead his men out of there.

127
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And yet he wrote a letter.

128
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And he mentions earlier like what he says

129
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and the letter basically says that the leadership

130
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
the extolans making some mistakes.

131
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And guess what?

132
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They screen those letters.

133
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They read what he wrote.

134
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And they arrested.

135
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So,

136
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
war is hell.

137
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And he talks a little bit about that here.

138
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
For three weeks,

139
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the war had been going on inside Germany.

140
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And all of us knew very well

141
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that if the girls were German,

142
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
they could be raped and then shot.

143
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
This was almost a combat distinction.

144
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Had they been Polish girls

145
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
or our own displaced Russian girls,

146
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
they could have been chased naked around the garden

147
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and slapped on the behind

148
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and amusement no more.

149
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
By the way,

150
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that's just a little,

151
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a little shot of what that war

152
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
between the Russians and the Germans

153
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
was the Russians and the Germans.

154
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We talked about it in Stalingrad,

155
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but we talked a little bit about what happened with civilians.

156
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There's a little taste of what happens to civilians

157
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
in those situations.

158
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It's a nightmare.

159
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Going on,

160
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
the history,

161
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
this is chapter two,

162
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the history of our sewage disposal system.

163
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And this is where he expands

164
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and explains sort of his view

165
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of the prisons as a whole.

166
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Back to the book.

167
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It is well known that any organ,

168
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
withers away if it is not used.

169
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Therefore,

170
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
if we know that the Soviet security organ

171
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
or organs

172
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and they christen themselves with this viral word,

173
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
praised and exalted above all living things

174
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
have not died off even to the extent of one single tentacle,

175
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but instead have grown new ones

176
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and strengthened their muscles.

177
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It is easy to deduce

178
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that they have had constant exercise.

179
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Through the sewer pipes,

180
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the flow pulsed.

181
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Sometimes the pressure was higher

182
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
than it had been projected,

183
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
sometimes lower,

184
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
but the prison sewers were never empty.

185
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The blood,

186
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
the sweat,

187
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and the urine into which we were

188
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
pulped,

189
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
pulsed through them continuously.

190
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And he uses this term,

191
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
which I guess the Soviets

192
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
actually called the prison system organs.

193
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And how the blood of the organs

194
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
was these people.

195
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And this is something that I talked a little bit

196
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
about with Jordan.

197
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Back to the book.

198
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And even though Lenin at the end of 1917

199
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
in order to establish

200
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
strictly revolutionary order

201
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
demanded merciless suppression

202
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
of attempts at anarchy

203
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
on the part of drunkards,

204
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
who legans,

205
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
counter-revolutionaries

206
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and other persons.

207
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So that's how it starts off.

208
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It starts off with that.

209
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We're going out.

210
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
These are the people that need to be rounded up.

211
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
The people that need to be rounded up

212
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are drunkards,

213
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
cool against counter-revolutionaries

214
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and other persons.

215
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
That's where it starts.

216
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And then it continues

217
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and it goes on.

218
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And he writes an essay,

219
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Lenin writes an essay

220
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
called How to Organize,

221
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
How to Organize the Competition.

222
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And he proclaimed,

223
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
this again,

224
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
this is Lenin proclaimed,

225
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
common,

226
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the common,

227
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
united purpose of

228
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
purging the Russian land

229
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
of all kinds of harmful insects.

230
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And the term insects.

231
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And under the term insects,

232
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
he included not only all

233
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
class enemies,

234
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
but also workers

235
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
malingering at their work.

236
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
For example,

237
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the type setters

238
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
of the Petrograd Party printing shops.

239
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So you can see,

240
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you can see this is starting to expand already.

241
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It starts off just,

242
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
hey,

243
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
it's Hooligans and drunkards

244
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and counter-revolutionaries.

245
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Now all of a sudden it's getting towards

246
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
workers that are being lazy.

247
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
You're being a little bit lazy,

248
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
guess what?

249
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You need to be,

250
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
you need to be arrested

251
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and you're one of these insects.

252
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And then this is how this grows.

253
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And he goes through this massive list

254
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
of the people that need to,

255
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that become insects.

256
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And he describes him as insects.

257
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So this included local self-governing bodies

258
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
in the provinces.

259
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They were insects.

260
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And people in the cooperative movements,

261
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
they were insects.

262
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
As were anyone that owned their own home

263
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
was an insect.

264
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There were not a few insects

265
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
among the teachers in the gymnasians

266
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and the church parish councils

267
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
were made up almost exclusively of insects.

268
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
All priests were insects.

269
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And all those tall stoians who,

270
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
when they undertook to serve the Soviet government,

271
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
for example, on the railroads, refuse to sign

272
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
the required oath to defend the Soviet government

273
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
with gun in hand,

274
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
thereby showed themselves to be insects too.

275
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The railroads were particularly important

276
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
for there were indeed many insects

277
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
hidden beneath the railroad.

278
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And telegraphers, they were insects.

279
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And he just goes on and on.

280
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
All Russian executive committee

281
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
of the Union of Railroad Workers

282
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and other trade unions were also often filled

283
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
with insects hostile to the working class.

284
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So this paragraph just goes on and on.

285
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And basically what it would end up as

286
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
everyone's an insect.

287
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
That's how it ends up.

288
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Everyone's an insect.

289
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And therefore everyone must be arrested eventually.

290
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Here's another expansion.

291
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Here, this is the decree from the Council of People's

292
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Commissars signed by Lenin on July 22nd, 1918.

293
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Those guilty of selling or buying up or keeping for sale

294
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in the way of business food products,

295
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which have been placed under the monopoly of the Republic.

296
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
They deserve imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years.

297
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Combined with the most severe forced labor

298
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and confiscation of all their property.

299
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So if you operate on any kind of black market whatsoever,

300
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
10 years confiscation of everything you own,

301
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that's where we're at right now.

302
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
1921 began with the Czech Order number 10

303
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
dated January 8th to intensified the repression of the

304
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
bourgeoisie.

305
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now when the civil war had ended,

306
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
repression was not to be reduced to but intensified.

307
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So the civil war is over.

308
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The revolutions over.

309
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And you think, okay, the revolutions over,

310
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
we can back off a little bit.

311
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
No.

312
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
No.

313
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Now we're going to go harder.

314
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
In that same year,

315
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the practice of arresting students began.

316
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The arrests of members of all non-bulsific parties

317
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
were expanded and systematized.

318
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Not one citizen of the former Russian state

319
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
who had ever joined a party other than the

320
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Bolshevik party could avoid his fate.

321
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Men of religion were an inevitable part of every annual catch.

322
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And their silver locks gleamed in every cell,

323
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and in every prisoner transport on route

324
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to the Solvetsty Islands.

325
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And those are prisons.

326
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Monks and nuns whose black habits had been a distinct

327
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
of future of old Russian life were intensively rounded up

328
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
on every hand placed under arrest and sent into exile.

329
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And the war was not a war.

330
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
As Tanya Kodovich wrote,

331
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
you can pray freely,

332
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but just so God alone can hear.

333
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So you're allowed to pray,

334
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
but only God can hear it.

335
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Meaning don't let anyone else hear it.

336
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And by the way, because you wrote that,

337
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
she got a ten year sentence for that.

338
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
All persons convicted of religious activity received

339
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
teners, which is the ten year sentence.

340
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So you can see how this just gets completely out of control.

341
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And one thing about this book is it's not really chronological.

342
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So it goes through whole, like this first chapters,

343
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
it goes through from like the revolution all the way through after the war.

344
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And then you go through,

345
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it's not chronological.

346
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It just kind of jumps around a little bit.

347
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So you have to, you kind of have to just pay attention all the time

348
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to what time frame he's talking about.

349
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Luckily he gives a lot of dates on when things are happening.

350
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
For instance, here back to the book,

351
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
this therapy continued full speed from 1927 on

352
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and immediately exposed to the proletariat,

353
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
all the causes of our economic failures and surrogages.

354
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Okay, let's pay attention to this.

355
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
All the causes of our economic failures and surrogages.

356
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So obviously Russia's going through all kinds of problems at this time.

357
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And here's what caused them.

358
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
There was wrecking and wrecking is their term for basically a saboteur.

359
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Someone that's causing the problems is a record.

360
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
There was wrecking in the people's commissariat of railroad roads.

361
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
That was why it was hard to get aboard the train

362
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and why there were interruptions in supplies.

363
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
There was wrecking in the Moscow electric power system

364
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and interruptions in power.

365
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
There was wrecking in the oil industry hence the shortage of carousine.

366
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Carousine.

367
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
There was wreckage and textile, hence nothing for a working man to wear.

368
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Where?

369
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
In the coal industry, there was colossal wrecking, hence no heat.

370
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
In the metallur in the metallurgy, defense, machinery, shipbuilding,

371
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
chemical, mining, golden platinum industries, and irrigation,

372
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
everywhere there were these poss-filled boils of wrecking.

373
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Animals with slide rules were on all sides.

374
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So, they have problems in the country.

375
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And it's what the party is saying.

376
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Hey, this is because we've got these wreckers, these saboteurs everywhere.

377
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Animals with slide rules.

378
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The GPU puffed and panted in its efforts to grab off and drag off all the wreckers.

379
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
In the capitals and in the Providence, provinces, the GPU Collegiums,

380
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and the proletarian courts kept hard at work,

381
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
sifting through the viscous sewage.

382
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And every day the workers gasped to learn,

383
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and sometimes they didn't learn from the papers of new viral deeds.

384
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So you had the state press putting out all this is what's happening.

385
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
These are the wreckers.

386
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Every industry, every factory, and every handicraft artell

387
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
had to find wreckers in its ranks.

388
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
A new snow sooner had they begun to look, then they found them.

389
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Continues on, when not long afterward, the new people's commissar of the railroads,

390
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
ordered that average loads should be increased and even doubled and then tripled.

391
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And for this discovery, received order of linen along with other others of our leaders.

392
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
The malicious engineers who protested became known as Limiters.

393
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
They raised the outcry that this was too much and would result in the breakdowns of the rolling stock.

394
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And they were rightly shot for their lack of faith in the possibilities of socialist transport.

395
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
So that right there sums up a lot.

396
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Because you're in this situation and there's some buddy at the top that's saying,

397
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
oh, we need to transport more stuff on the railroads.

398
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Cool, just load them up more.

399
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And the actual engineers are saying, they can't handle that much weight.

400
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Hey, they can't handle that much weight.

401
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
It's going to ruin the trains.

402
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It's going to break the trains.

403
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And what do they do?

404
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Shoot them.

405
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Shoot them in the back.

406
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Shoot them in the back of the head.

407
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Because, and they call them Limiters. They gave them a name.

408
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
You're a limiter.

409
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
You just don't want to make this happen.

410
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
That's your problem.

411
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And there's a, there's a great passage that I read in a book that I'm going to read right now.

412
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And this book that I'm going to pull a real quick passage from,

413
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:50.000
it's a book called Basic Economics Written by a famous, a very famous economist.

414
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I should say named Thomas Sal.

415
00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And he's just talking about, he's talking about how they tried to regulate prices in the Soviet Union.

416
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And another way to set the prices on everything.

417
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
And he's, and it says this. So this is from, this is the role of prices as the name of the chapter in Basic Economics by Thomas Sal.

418
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:26.000
The significance of free market prices in the allocation of resources can be seen more clearly by looking at situations where prices are not allowed to perform this function.

419
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
During the era of the government directed economy of the Soviet Union, for example,

420
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:50.000
prices were not set by supply and demand, but by central planners who sent resources to their various uses by direct commands supplemented by prices that the planners raised or lowered as they saw fit.

421
00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And now he goes into this part where he takes these two Soviet economists and they described a situation in which their government raised the price it would pay for mole skin.

422
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Leading hunters to sell more of them. And here's that description. And this is these two Soviet economists.

423
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Schmell-Evan Pop-Off who described the situation where the government raised the price it paid for mole skins.

424
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Here we go.

425
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
State purchases increased.

426
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
And now all the distribution centers are filled with these pelts.

427
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Industry is unable to use them all. And they often rot in warehouses before they can be processed.

428
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
The Ministry of Light Industry has already requested, go scotch them in.

429
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:47.000
The Ministry of Light Industry has already requested twice to lower purchasing prices, but the question has not been decided yet.

430
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And this is not surprising.

431
00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Its members are too busy to decide. They have no time. Besides setting the prices on these pelts, they have to keep track of another 24 million prices.

432
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
So that's what happens. And that's what's going on.

433
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
You've got somebody trying to essentially, it's the opposite of decentralized command.

434
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
You've got people trying to figure out what a pelts, what this mole skin pelts should cost.

435
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And what happens is when the government raises the price they'll pay for it. What do all the people do?

436
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
They go and gather more of these pelts.

437
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And now there's no restock of them. And they try and get them to lower the prices.

438
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
So people won't stop. We'll stop turning them in. But they can't do it quick enough because they got 24 million other prices that they got a set for the government.

439
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So that in a nutshell is why all these problems are one of the major reasons why all these problems are occurring.

440
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And whenever somebody tries to resist what commands are being given, they're getting shot.

441
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Limitors.

442
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Yeah. And this is when I talk about a little bit with Jordan in September 1930, the famine organizers were tried with a great hue and cry.

443
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
They were the ones there they are.

444
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
There were 48 records in the food industry.

445
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Stalin carried out the first such effort in connection with the trial of the famine organizers.

446
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
And how could it not succeed when everyone was starving in Boutnus Russia?

447
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And everyone was always looking about and asking where did all our dear bread get to?

448
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Therefore, before the court verdict, the workers and employees raffly voted for the death penalty for the scoundrels on trial.

449
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
It was the newspaper March of Millions.

450
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And the roar rose outside the windows of the courtroom. Deaf death death death.

451
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
So for these types of reasons, for this centralized command doesn't work.

452
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Not to mention what they did took the farms away from the people that actually knew how to farm.

453
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
There's complete famine.

454
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And they're blaming it on the 48 people that were sabotored inside the agriculture industry.

455
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Completely insane.

456
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And this one I read with Jordan, I'm going to read it again.

457
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Russian in Russian, a cool act is a miserly dishonest rural trader who grows rich, not by his own labor, but through someone else's through usury and operating as a middleman.

458
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.000
In every locality, even before the revolution, such cool acts could be numbered on one's fingers.

459
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And the revolution totally destroyed their basis of activity.

460
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And then, consequently, after 1917, by a transfer of meaning, the name Koolak began to be applied to all those who in any way hired workers, even if it was only when they were temporarily short of working hands in their own families.

461
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So a Koolak started off as someone that was trying to, you know, rip people off.

462
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
But then they just started applying it to everyone.

463
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Anyone that hired someone was a Koolak.

464
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And it has a derogatory tone to it.

465
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Continuing on, but the inflation of this scathing term Koolak proceeded relentlessly, and by 1930, all strong peasants in general were being so called.

466
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
All peasants, strong and management, strong and worker, even strong merely in convictions.

467
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
The term Koolak was used to smash the strength of the peasantry.

468
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Beyond this, in every village, there were people who in one way or another had personally gotten in the way of the local activists.

469
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
This was the perfect time to settle accounts with them of jealousy, envy, and insult.

470
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
A new word was needed for all those victims as a class, and it was born.

471
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
By this time, it had no social or economic content whatsoever, but had a marvelous sound.

472
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000
A person who had a good time with a new word was called POT Koolak, a person who had the Koolak.

473
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
In other words, I consider you a comp and a comp of the enemy.

474
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Now, what's interesting about this, and I had a bunch of people point this out.

475
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000
This is when we take words, powerful words, and we start to throw them at people and we use them universally.

476
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
That's going to cause a problem.

477
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And you can see it all the time right now in social media and in the, yeah, I guess you see it primarily in social media, from like far left extremists and far right extremists.

478
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
To the far right, anybody that's to the left to them is like a communist.

479
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
To the far left, anybody that's to the right of them is a racist or a Nazi.

480
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And they throw those words around, and those words that you shouldn't use those words.

481
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
It's like using Koolak. Like that's not the person that higher someone is in a Koolak, right?

482
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
It like that doesn't work.

483
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
So we escalate these terms, and that's not a healthy thing to do.

484
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I mean, I think it was when, yeah, I mean, when Jordan Peterson gets compared to Adolf Hitler, right?

485
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
They compare Jordan Peterson to Adolf Hitler.

486
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Come on.

487
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
He doesn't like some of Jordan Peterson's ideas.

488
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah.

489
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Okay. That's cool.

490
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Don't call him Adolf Hitler.

491
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Yeah.

492
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Like that's just not realistic.

493
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Yeah.

494
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:43.000
It's not helpful to, you know, or people don't like his ideas or whatever, like for a specific reason, you know, rather than identify the reason, they just like package them up and put a ugly bow tie on it.

495
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It wouldn't be like, yeah, I hate you kind of think.

496
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And the right, you know, if you think about during McCarthyism, right, it was, hey, anti-american, you're anti-american, you're a communist.

497
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
It was like, they were flagging people like that.

498
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So both sides can do this. In this case, it's, in this case, it's the, it's the communist, the escalating these terms.

499
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000
We've seen the right do it. We see the left do it, not a smart thing to do. Don't throw those terms out, where they don't belong.

500
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Yeah.

501
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Talk to about this a little bit with Jordan. There was a wave.

502
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And then we talked about wave. He talked about waves of people that would flow into the prisons.

503
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And there's not all these different ways. He talks about dozens and dozens of different waves.

504
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:44.000
There was a wave for snipping ears. The nighttime snipping of individual ears of grain in the field, a totally new type of agricultural activity, a new type of harvesting.

505
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
The wave of those caught doing this was not small.

506
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000
It included many tens of thousands of peasants, many of them not even adults, but boys, girls and small children,

507
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
whose elders had sent them out at night to snip because they had no hope of receiving anything from the collective farm for their daytime labor.

508
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:10.000
For this bitter and not very productive occupation and extreme of poverty to which the peasants had not been driven even in surfdom,

509
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
the courts handed out a full measure.

510
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Ten years for what ranked as an especially dangerous theft of socialist property.

511
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Again, that's why I say this book is kind of like to read.

512
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
He's kind of funny, right?

513
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And especially dangerous theft of socialist properties, talking about taking a one ear of grain.

514
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Is he saying that like on his own kind of thing? Or is that what the people would say?

515
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
That's the thing.

516
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
That's the authorities.

517
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
You stole communist property, socialist property, you stole it.

518
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And you must be destroyed in ten years because you took a little piece of grain.

519
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Yes, like if you get a, I don't know, J walking ticket or something.

520
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Hey, you committed a crime ear criminal, kind of thing.

521
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Yeah, you can just call someone a criminal.

522
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Yeah.

523
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Usually has even though technically, you know, they're not kind of wrong, you know?

524
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Yeah, I got rolled up in Vegas.

525
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Yeah.

526
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I got rolled up in Vegas.

527
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I was with Sarge.

528
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Sure.

529
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
We were crossing one of the big streets in Vegas.

530
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And I had to grab something or I dropped something last time.

531
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I sure were doing something.

532
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And the walking light went red.

533
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Yeah.

534
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
But the cars weren't going yet.

535
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And Sarge had already walked across.

536
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So I just kind of jogged across like, you know, before and then the cars started moving.

537
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Yeah.

538
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Squad car lights.

539
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Then 10 seconds later, four squad cars.

540
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I don't know if they thought I was somebody else.

541
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
So I'm there, you know, on on the curb face down.

542
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
No, no, no.

543
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Yeah, face down.

544
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Sarge is videoing it.

545
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
He's laughing at me.

546
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Yes, I was a criminal.

547
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Wait, so you, but what then did, what they do?

548
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Did you get a rest?

549
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
No, they gave me a ticket.

550
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
They gave me a ticket.

551
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
They gave me a ticket.

552
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
They gave me a ticket.

553
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Yeah.

554
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Well, I guess criminal, right?

555
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
What's a criminal?

556
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And they probably thought, they probably thought, oh, we're going to roll up this drunk

557
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
80 and I'm totally so.

558
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
I was up there for the UFC.

559
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
You know, I was up there with a fighter.

560
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I don't, we were probably going to, you know, cut weight or something with a fighter.

561
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Yeah.

562
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And then I am getting rolled up.

563
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Roll that crap.

564
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Just a roll that's for Jay Hawking.

565
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
For the purpose.

566
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
They must have thought I was somebody else.

567
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Well, yeah, I mean, you're going to be a, you know, and it's like, hey, this guy looks like he could

568
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
be a travel or something.

569
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Jay Hawking.

570
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
You know, obviously a criminal.

571
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Yeah.

572
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
But the, I guess when you think about a criminal, right, criminal, what's, what is that?

573
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Is that like a,

574
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Well, someone who commits a margin of your, in this case, what they'd say is, oh, you were blocking the

575
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
transportation of socialist property.

576
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Therefore, you, that's a crime against the state.

577
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
You're 10 years.

578
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
That's the same.

579
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
That's exactly what we're talking about.

580
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Yeah.

581
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
That's exactly what we're talking about.

582
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Yeah.

583
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
It's like when people tell you, you're from Jay Hawking.

584
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Yeah.

585
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
10 years were going out and clipping a single grain of, of a single, a, a, a, a, a year of corn or

586
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
grain.

587
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Yeah.

588
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Getting 10 years for that.

589
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And you're, your 12 years older, whatever.

590
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Yeah.

591
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And you're going to get against the state.

592
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
It's like when people throw around the word trees and, you know, you know, you know,

593
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
how like when when people get into political debates,

594
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
oh, around, oh, that's treason.

595
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Yeah.

596
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
That's, you're right.

597
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
There's people throw that word around when it shouldn't be thrown around.

598
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Be careful.

599
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
When you, when you commit treason, that's death.

600
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Yeah.

601
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
It's a big deal, man.

602
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So people say, uh,

603
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Oh, what, what's a good example of that's treason.

604
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Yeah.

605
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Treason's a big deal.

606
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
You shouldn't throw that word around unless you're thinking somebody needs a death penalty.

607
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Yeah.

608
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
So you guys have a good example.

609
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Check.

610
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Back to the book, paradoxically enough,

611
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
every act of the all penetrating eternally wakeful organs over a span of many years

612
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.000
was based solely on one article of the 140 articles of the non-general division of the criminal

613
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
criminal code of 1926.

614
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So this is where all this crap came from.

615
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
They wrote this criminal code of 1926.

616
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And the including the great powerful abundant highly ramified multi-form wide sweeping article

617
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
58, which summed up the world not so much through the exact terms of its sections,

618
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
as in their extended dialectical interpretation.

619
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
In all truth, there is no step, thought, action or lack of action under the heavens,

620
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
which could not be punished by the heavy hand of article 58.

621
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
The article itself could not be worded in such broad terms,

622
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
but it proved possible to interpret it this broadly.

623
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Article 58 was not in that division of the code dealing with the political crimes

624
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
and nowhere was it categorized as political.

625
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
No, it was included with crimes against public order and organized gangsterism

626
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
in a division of crimes against the state.

627
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And then he goes through all these various sections of article 58, which had 14 sections.

628
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
In section one, we learned that any action, and according to Article 6 of the criminal code,

629
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
any absence of action directed toward the weakening of state power,

630
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
was considered to be counter-revolutionary, broadly interpreted this turned out to include

631
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
the refusal of a prisoner in camp to work when in the state, when in a state of starvation, and exhaustion.

632
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000
That was a weakening of state power, and it was punished by execution.

633
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Because if you're in prison and you're starving, but you're not doing the work you're supposed to do,

634
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
you're doing something that's hurting the state.

635
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
So you need to die.

636
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
This is, you can't, I was having trouble, and I think even Jordan,

637
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
like we were trying to get explained that this is like a sick comedy.

638
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Like we kept saying back and forth to each other, we're like, you can't make this up.

639
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
You can't make this up.

640
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Like you can't make that up.

641
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And this is real.

642
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Yeah, this is a sick comedy.

643
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
That's an interesting, yet accurate way to put it.

644
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
It's like, you know, I can't think of an example, you know how someone will like,

645
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
he'll say, I don't know, a cable actually, you know what it was?

646
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
It was like some cable commercial, they do this in a funny way, a comedy way.

647
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
They'll say, hey, don't get cable,

648
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
because if, and then they'll say like, what does he say?

649
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
So something like, yeah, if you don't listen to your parents, you don't do your homework.

650
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
If you don't do your homework, you don't get a good job.

651
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
If you don't get a good job, you know, and it's this whole thing.

652
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
You can then crack house.

653
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Yeah, so don't end up in a crack house.

654
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
You know, kind of thing and they related to the thing.

655
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
And it's like, I see what you did there, you know, and each one,

656
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
but it's like, you're just being funny.

657
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Like, obviously that's not that, you know,

658
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
but they're just drawing on these parallels to everything.

659
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
So this one, they must be the same.

660
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
You know, kind of thing, you know, like, yeah, if you get, if you can't so

661
00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
people, I forget how it goes, but well, to your point, this is that kind of,

662
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
this sounds like you just being that crazy, but this is real.

663
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
When our soldiers were sentenced to only 10 years for allowing themselves to be taken prisoner,

664
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
action injurious to the Soviet military might,

665
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
this was humanitarian to the point of being illegal,

666
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
according to the Stalinist code, they all should have been shot upon their return home.

667
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So they're saying, you know what?

668
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
The people that were allowed the Soviet soldiers that allowed themselves to be captured,

669
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
they only got 10 years, which is actually kind of illegal because they should have been shot.

670
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
The article 19 of the criminal code, via intent.

671
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
In other words, no treason had taken place, but the interrogator envisioned an intention

672
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
to betray and that was enough to justify a full term.

673
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
This same is actual. So if I just think you had the intent, that's good enough.

674
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
You're getting 10 years.

675
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Section three was assisting in any way where by any means a foreign state at war.

676
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
This is action made it possible to condemn any citizen who had been in occupied territory,

677
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
whether he had nailed on the peel of a German soldier's shoe or sold him a bunch of radishes.

678
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
You get your tanner right there.

679
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
There's these two things, PSH, which is suspicion of espionage and then an SH,

680
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
which is on proven aspen espionage, you can charge someone with unproven espionage.

681
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
What does that even mean?

682
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Hey, we're just, you know, we're your guilty for unproven.

683
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
That's like your guilty of unproven murder.

684
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
What does that mean?

685
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
It's not proven, but that's what your guilty of, and that's why you're going to die.

686
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Or maybe it's the kind of, you know, how here, you'll say, like, hey, he's, he's in a ledger,

687
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
you know, before you're proven in the court of the lock, maybe you're in that window.

688
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
No, no, no.

689
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
The same thing.

690
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Even espionage, you're going to go to prison for 10 years for it.

691
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Section eight covered terror.

692
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Terror was construed in a very broad sense, not simply a matter of putting bombs on their

693
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
governors' characters, but for example, smashing the face of a personal enemy,

694
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
if he was an activist in the party or the police, that was terror.

695
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
And then he starts talking about section 10, which is propaganda or agitation containing an appeal

696
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
for the overflow subverting or weakening of the Soviet power, and equally the dissemination

697
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
or preparation or possession of literary materials of similar content.

698
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So any, if you're running propaganda, you can get trouble.

699
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
But here we go.

700
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000
The term preparation of literary materials covered every letter, note, or private diary,

701
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
even when only the original document existed.

702
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So anything that you write down is subject.

703
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Well, that's why he went to prison for a letter.

704
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
The real law underlying the rest, all those years, was the assignment of quotas.

705
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
The norm set, the planned allocations, every city, every district, every military unit,

706
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
was assigned a specific quota of arrest to be carried out by a stipulated time.

707
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
That's like when cops get the quota for the speeding ticket.

708
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Yeah, that's when you get the ticket for the only document.

709
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
38 and a 35.

710
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Is that true, though?

711
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Sometimes it is.

712
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
I don't know.

713
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I thought it was true, but I have no idea.

714
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Is that just a myth?

715
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
You know, how like people they did, they're just mad because they got to take it.

716
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
You know, you're like all these people.

717
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
You're going to be too cool to go.

718
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
But it's not even real.

719
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
You know, like, it doesn't have a real thing.

720
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I have no idea.

721
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
All right, it could be a mess that I just believed.

722
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Yeah, you know, because you've probably got that ticket when you're going to

723
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
38 and the 35.

724
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
And we need it.

725
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
That's why I'm questioning it.

726
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
I did get pulled over a few months ago, but.

727
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Why, bro?

728
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
If you tinted windows.

729
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
No, I was going too fast in this area.

730
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Yeah. Oh, straight up speeding. Yeah. But you got off. They give you a break.

731
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Yeah.

732
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Because they they recognize you.

733
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
No.

734
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
They're little.

735
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
They're okay.

736
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Nice.

737
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
You did.

738
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I think.

739
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Uh.

740
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Check.

741
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Back to the book, Piles of Victims, Hills of Victims.

742
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Here's some other people got arrested.

743
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
And Electrician had a high tension line break in his sector.

744
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
587. That's the article.

745
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
20 years.

746
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
A plumber turned off the loudspeaker in his room every time the endless letters to Stalin were being read.

747
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
His next door neighbor denounced him.

748
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Where are we?

749
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Where is that neighbor today?

750
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
He got SOE socially dangerous element eight years.

751
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
So she's looking.

752
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
By the end of number 1941, becoming bigger in the autumn, the wave of the encircled was surging.

753
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And again, the waves talking about waves of prisoners that are showing up.

754
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
The waves of the encircled were surging in.

755
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
These were the defenders of their native land.

756
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:08.000
The very same warriors whom the cities had seen sent off to the front with bouquets and bands a few months before.

757
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Who had then sustained the heaviest tank assaults of the Germans and in general chaos.

758
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And through no fault of their own had spent a certain time as isolated units, not in enemy imprisonment, not at all.

759
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
But in temporary encirclement and later had broken out.

760
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You understand what that means?

761
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
That means they're surrounded by the enemy.

762
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
They get captured by the enemy.

763
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
They get surrounded for a little while.

764
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
And then they break out and they get back to friendly lines.

765
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And instead of being given a brotherly embrace on their return,

766
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
such as every other army in the world would have given them.

767
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Instead of being given a chance to rest up to visit their families and then return to their units,

768
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
they were held on suspicion, disarmed, deprived of rights,

769
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:02.000
and taken away in groups to identification points and screening centers where officers of the special branches started interrogating them,

770
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:11.000
distrusting not only their every word, but their very identity.

771
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Traders of the motherland under 581B.

772
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000
But at first until the standard penalty was finally determined, they got less than 10 years.

773
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:34.000
You can't imagine that people would go along.

774
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
We can't imagine that people go along with this.

775
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
The level of fear that you have to have as a nation and as a people to go along with that right there,

776
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
are frontline troops were surrounded by the enemy.

777
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
They managed to escape and get back and now we're going to put them on trial and put them in prison.

778
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000
It's insanity.

779
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Next chapter talks about interrogation.

780
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Going to the book of the intellectuals in the plays of Czechoslovakia,

781
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
who spent all their time guessing what would happen in 2030 or 40 years had been told that in 40 years,

782
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000
interrogation by torture would be practiced in Russia that prisoners would have their skull squeezed with iron rings,

783
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
that a human being would be lowered into an acid bath, that they would be trussed up naked to be bitten by ants and bedbugs,

784
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
that a ramrod heated over a prime stove would be thrust up their anal canal, the secret brand,

785
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
that a man's genitals would be slowly crushed beneath the toe of a jackboot,

786
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:50.000
and that in the luckiest possible circumstances prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping for a week by thirst and by being beaten to a bloody pulp.

787
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Not one of Czechoslov's plays would have gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylum.

788
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.000
If the intellectuals in the plays of Czechoslovakia spent all their time guessing what would happen in 2030 or 40 years had been told that in 40 years,

789
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
interrogation by torture would be practiced in Russia.

790
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
That prisoners would have their skull squeezed within iron rings,

791
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.000
that a human being would be lowered into an acid bath, that they would be trussed up naked to be bitten by ants and bedbugs,

792
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
that a ramrod heated over a prime stove would be thrust up their anal canal.

793
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
That a man's genitals would be slowly crushed beneath the toe of a jackboot,

794
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
and that in the luckiest possible circumstances prisoners would be tortured by being kept from sleeping for a week by thirst,

795
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
and by being beaten into a bloody pulp.

796
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Not one of Czechoslov's plays would have gotten to its end because all the heroes would have gone off to insane asylum.

797
00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.000
This is horrible.

798
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
So they have these savage interrogations in torture, continuing on.

799
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
The time-allotted for investigation was not used to unravel the crime.

800
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:27.000
In 95 cases out of 100 to exhaust, wear down, weaken, and render helpless the defendant so that he would want to end it at any cost.

801
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Then he talks about some of the methods that we're used.

802
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I mean, talk about some of the torture, and these were just some of the kind of the basic, the baseline abuse that you're going to get.

803
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
You're going to get kept from sleep. You're going to get persuasion.

804
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
They'd say, look, you're going to get prison terminal matter what happens.

805
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
But if you resist, you'll grow right here in prison. You'll lose your health.

806
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.000
But if you go to camp, you'll have fresh air and sunlight, so why not sign this paper right now?

807
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
They do that. They do psychological contrast.

808
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
You know, good cop bad cop humiliation, extreme confusion, intimidation.

809
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
They tell them we've got hard labor camps. Now if you confess, you go to an easy camp.

810
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
But if you're stoner, stuber, you'll get 25 years in handcuffs in the mines.

811
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:28.000
They'd lie, of course. They'd play on the affections for those. One loved.

812
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
We'll arrest your daughter and lock her in a cell with syphiletics.

813
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
That's that one that they always throw. They're going to break, oh, they can't break you, cool.

814
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Guess what they're going to do to your daughter, guess what they're going to do to your wife, guess what they're going to do to your son.

815
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Now he has a great paragraph, and I talked about this a little bit with Jordan.

816
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:14.000
But it's a reflecting on his behavior. And this is when he started talking, and again, I skipped through a lot of the interrogation.

817
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
You have to read the book. You have to read the whole book. And you have to really jump into that.

818
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I hit the high wave tops of it. And this section he's talking about the guards, right?

819
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000
The people that he called him blue caps, these are people that were the guards, people that were processing you through the Gulogs.

820
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And much like Jordan kind of talks about seeing himself as the bad guy, right? The perpetrator.

821
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
As opposed to always seeing like, oh, everyone thinks I wouldn't do that. I'd be one of these victims.

822
00:47:49.000 --> 00:48:03.000
He, uh, solstion, it's an seize himself in a way he reflects on the way he behaved actually as an officer, as a privileged officer in the Russian army.

823
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:14.000
And this is, this is such a great little section about leadership, because it tells you what not to do as a leader.

824
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:24.000
So here we go, and this is a great start off to this. It starts off here, back to the book, pride grows in the human heart, like,

825
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:35.000
a large, on a pig. I tossed out orders to my subordinates that I would not allow them to question, convince that no orders could be wiser.

826
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Let's check. Number one right there. These are things not to do as a leader. I throw out orders to my subordinates without letting them question them.

827
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Convinced in his own mind that they hate my orders and the best orders. Completely wrong.

828
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Next, even at the front where one might have thought death made equals of a soul, my power soon convinced me that I was a superior human being.

829
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Wrong. You're not better than your troops. Next, seated there, I heard them out as they stood a detention.

830
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I interrupted them. I issued commands. I addressed fathers and grandfather's with the familiar downgrading form of address, while they, of course, addressed me formally.

831
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I sent them out to repair wire under shell fire so that my superiors would not reproach me.

832
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:36.000
I ate my officer's ration of butter with rolls without giving a thought as to why I had a right to do it and why the rank and file soldiers did not.

833
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000
So, hey, we're out there in the field. You're going to eat whatever shoe leather, and I'm over here eating my butter with rolls.

834
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:56.000
I, of course, had a personal servant assigned to me in polite terms and orderly, who my badgered one way or another, in order to look after my person and prepare my meal separately from the soldiers.

835
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:10.000
I forced my soldiers to put their backs into it and dig me a special dugout at every new bivouac and to haul the heaviest beams to support it so that I would be as comfortable and as safe as possible.

836
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000
And, wait a minute, yes, my battery always had a guard house too, meaning a little prison cell. What kind of guard house could there be in the woods?

837
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:28.000
It was a pit, of course, although it had a roof on it.

838
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:38.000
It talks about imprisoning some, uh, Vishkov was imprisoned there for losing his horse and pop off for maltreating his car bean.

839
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Yes, just a moment, I can remember more. They sold me a map case out of a German hide, not human, but from a car seat.

840
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:58.000
But I didn't have a strap for it, and I was unhappy about that. Then all of a sudden, they saw some partisan commas are from the local district party committee wearing just the right kind of strap, and they took it away from him.

841
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
We are the army. We have seniority.

842
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Finally, I coveted that scarlet box, and I remember how they took it away and got it for me.

843
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
That's what shoulder boards do to a human being.

844
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:25.000
So, when you get rank, when you put on those shoulder boards, keep your ego in check.

845
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Don't act like that. Then believe me, I mean, I saw plenty of people like act like that in the military, and they were hated by their troops.

846
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Continuing on. So, let the reader who expects this book to be a political ex-Posay, slam its covers shut right now.

847
00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:04.000
If it were only also simple, if only there were evil people, somewhere in cityously committing evil deeds, and it will necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.

848
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:15.000
But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being, and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart.

849
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.000
So, if you're not careful, you got that evil in you.

850
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing.

851
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Place sometimes it's squeezed one way by an exuberant evil, and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish.

852
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000
One and the same human being is at various ages, and under various circumstances, a totally different human being.

853
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:46.000
At times he is close to being a devil at times to samehood, but his name doesn't change.

854
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:54.000
And to that name, we ascribe the whole lot good and evil.

855
00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.000
And that's a line that you hear Jordan Peterson read that line a lot, or say that line a lot.

856
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.

857
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:12.000
So, we all got a little piece of darkness in our hearts that you need to watch out for.

858
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Continuing on a little bit on that theme, the trouble lies in the way these classic evil doers are pictured.

859
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000
They recognize themselves as evil doers, and they know their souls are black, and they reason I cannot live unless I do evil.

860
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:32.000
So, I'll set my father against my brother, I'll drink the victim's sufferings until I'm drunk with them.

861
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
But no, that's not the way it is.

862
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:47.000
To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he is doing is good, or else that it's a well-considered act in conformity with natural law.

863
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Fortunately, is in the nature of the human being to speak a to seek a justification for his actions ideology.

864
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:06.000
That is what gives evil doing its long, sought justification, and gives the evil doer the necessary steadfastness and determination.

865
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:20.000
That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own eyes and others eyes, so that he won't hear reproaches and curses, but we'll receive praise and honors.

866
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:42.000
That was how agents of the inquisition fortified their wills by invoking Christianity, the conquerors of foreign lands by extoling the grandeur of the motherland, the colonizers by civilization, the Nazis by race, the Jacobians, early and late by equality brotherhood and the happiness of future generations.

867
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Thanks to ideology, the 20th century was faded to experience evil doing on a scale calculated in the millions.

868
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
This cannot be denied or passed over nor suppressed.

869
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000
How then do he derensists that evil doers do not exist and who was it that destroyed these millions without evil doers?

870
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
There would have been no archipelago.

871
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:17.000
So this is again something that we see a lot today when people get on and we see it in the past.

872
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Obviously he gave all the examples right there.

873
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:28.000
I mean the inquisition we haven't covered down on the podcast yet, but we probably need to because that was a damn nightmare.

874
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:39.000
And it was a nightmare with people that were saying, hey, this is for the good of Christianity.

875
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000
And you can go right on down the list when people make doing people do evil.

876
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
They have this ideological oftentimes have this ideological backing behind the doing it for this great cause.

877
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:58.000
And I got a book in the in the queue that's probably going to get done, which we're going to approach this thing right here.

878
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Evidently evil doing also has a threshold magnitude.

879
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Yes, a human being has a taste in Bob's back and forth between good and evil all his life.

880
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
He slips falls back, clambers up, repents, things begin to darken again.

881
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000
But just so long as the threshold of evil doing is not crossed, the possibility of returning remains.

882
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
And he himself is still within reach of our hope.

883
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:30.000
But when through the density of evil actions, the result, either of their own extreme degree of absoluteness of his power,

884
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
he suddenly crosses that threshold.

885
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000
He has left humanity behind and without perhaps the possibility of return.

886
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000
So there's some situations where people just go, they're not coming back. They're just going to do evil.

887
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
That's the way it's going to be.

888
00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:06.000
And I have a book in the queue right now that we're probably going to do that will explore that departure from being able to return.

889
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Continuing on, the only soldier in the world who cannot surrender is the soldier of the world's one and only red army.

890
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
That's what it says in our military statutes.

891
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
And cannot surrender. No surrender.

892
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
There's war there is death, but there is no surrender. What does discovery?

893
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
What it means is go and die. We will go on living.

894
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:37.000
And if you lose your legs, yet man is to return from captivity on crutches, we will convict you.

895
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000
And he mentions the lending gratter, Ivanov, commander of a machine gun, platoon in the finish war,

896
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:50.000
who lost both legs, and was imprisoned.

897
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Incidentally, it is very naive to say, what for?

898
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
In other words, what for? Why are they going to prison? No time have governments been more lost.

899
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
They never imprisoned people and executed them for having done something.

900
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
They imprisoned and executed them to keep them from doing something.

901
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
They imprisoned all those POWs, of course, not for treason to the motherland,

902
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000
because it was absolutely clear even to a fool that only the vlas off men could be accused of treason,

903
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.000
which is a group that we'll talk about them a little bit, but there was a general named vlas off that actually,

904
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:31.000
became a leader of Russian soldiers fighting against Russia alongside the Nazis.

905
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
So he said, yeah, those guys were traders against, but the normal POWs and normal soldiers,

906
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:45.000
they were traders, back to the book, they were imprisoned all of them to keep them from telling their fellow villagers about Europe.

907
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
But the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve for.

908
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.000
And just because these people had seen what it was like, you gotta go to prison. You know too much.

909
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
You could have acquired a very harmful spirit through living freely among Europeans.

910
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:13.000
And if you had not been afraid to escape and continue to fight, it meant you were a determined person and thus doubly dangerous in the motherland.

911
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Think about that.

912
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Because you had the courage to fight on and escape and get back, that means you're a courageous person and you're even more of a threat.

913
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Because you know how they live.

914
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Totally backwards.

915
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Now, like I said, this guy flas-off,

916
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:39.000
that he was surrounded and wanted to retreat and got told no.

917
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000
And his army was basically most of it was wiped out.

918
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
And then he was kind of wandering and escaped somewhat and they joined up.

919
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:58.000
When they were captured, joined up with some other troops that other Russian troops that were now pissed off, right?

920
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That they didn't, they, you, you wouldn't allow us to surrender, you wouldn't allow us to break out, you wouldn't allow us to leave.

921
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So they're pissed at Stalin.

922
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
And so then they turned and these vlas-off guys ended up fighting and I'm sure we'll do a book on these guys at some point.

923
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But you know, he became, he became the leader on Dray vlas-off.

924
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And they fought and they fought hard because they know they knew that they had no.

925
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And they weren't going to live if they were captured.

926
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And in fact, solstionitz says, when we captured them, we shot them as soon as the first intelligible Russian word came from their mouths.

927
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
This just straight up. That's what we're doing.

928
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Oh, you speak Russian? Cool. That means you're a vlas-off man. You're done.

929
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The term vlas-off-ite in our country has the same force as the word sewage.

930
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
We feel we are derving our mouths merely by pronouncing it. And therefore no one dears dares utter a sentence with vlas-off-ite in its subject.

931
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
But that is no way to write history.

932
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Now, a quarter of a century later, when most of them had perished in camps and those who have survived or living out their lives in the far north,

933
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I would like to issue a reminder through these pages that this was a phenomenon totally unheard of in haul the whole history of the world.

934
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:37.000
That several hundred thousand young men aged 20 to 30 took up arms against their fatherland as allies of its most evil enemy.

935
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Right, seeing this never happened hundreds of thousands of, there was hundreds of thousands of these vlas-off-trups.

936
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Hundreds of thousands of them. How do you get hundreds of thousands of men who are in the military? Like, okay, we get a trader, we get five traders, hundreds of thousands.

937
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And he says, back the book, perhaps there is something to ponder here, who is more to blame those youths or the gray fatherland.

938
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:16.000
One cannot explain this treason biologically. It had to have had a social cause, because, as the old proverb said,

939
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Well fed horses don't rampage.

940
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Then picture yourself a field in which starved, neglected, crazed horses are rampaging back and forth.

941
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Continuing on, there is a simple truth which one can learn only through suffering. In war, not victories are blessed, but defeats.

942
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Governments need victories and the people need defeats. Victory gives rise to the desire for more victories, but after defeat, it is freedom that men desire and usually attain.

943
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:14.000
A people need defeat, just as an individual needs suffering and misfortune, they compel the deepening of the inner life and generate a spiritual upsurge.

944
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
That's an interesting concept. That's what Jill Rogan talking about. You need to have some struggle, right?

945
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You need to have something to get after. And, and, and, social nets and saying, people in a country need that same thing.

946
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:47.000
They need that struggle. They want that struggle. And, this is, again, this is when we spent a little bit of time on with Jordan.

947
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:59.000
And, this is when when one of social nets and friends in the prison, Valentin said, they were expecting amnesty.

948
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
They're expecting to be set free. And, here we go back to the book, because we dried ourselves off, Valentin said to me,

949
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Rear-sherently, intimately, well, all right, we are still young. We are going to live a long time yet. The main thing is not to make a misstep now.

950
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We are going to a camp. And, we'll not say one word to anything, so they won't plaster new terms on us. We'll work honestly and keep our mouths shut.

951
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And, he really believed in his program, that naive little kernel of grain of caught between Stalin's millstones.

952
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:41.000
He really had his hopes set on it, and I was talking about amnesty. One wanted to agree with him to serve out the term coesely and then expunge from one's head what one had lived through.

953
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But, I had begun to sense a truth inside myself, if in order to live, it is necessary not to live, then what's it all for?

954
01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And, of course, Jordan and I got in the big, long discussion about playing the game. And, yeah, I mean, I think we both agreed that there's times where you have to play the game.

955
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And, if you don't, well, you'll end up in a worse position. So, we started talking a little bit about these kangaroo courts that went on.

956
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And, here's one of the judges makes the statement, we are not guided by laws, but by our revolutionary conscience. So, what does that mean?

957
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:40.000
That means we just make up whatever the hell we want to make up. Yeah, whatever we're going to make up, that's what we're going to do.

958
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And, in this book, part one of Volume One, he spends a lot of time talking about these multiple cases.

959
01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It goes through basically it's like court dramas. And he spells them out pretty good. And there's like dialogue back and forth between the accuser and the defendants and, you know, the uproar from the crowd.

960
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And it's like a multiple court dramas. One of them, the Moscow Church trial April 26 to May 7, 1922.

961
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:28.000
There were 17 defendants, including arch priests and laymen accused of disseminating the patriarchs proclamation. The charge was more important than the question of surrendering or not surrendering church valuables.

962
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And the presiding judge says, do you consider the state's law obligatory or not?

963
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And the patriarch says, yes, I recognize them to the extent that they do not contradict the rules of piety.

964
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Comrade Beck, the presiding judge was astounded, which, you know, the last analysis is more important to you, the laws of the church or the point of view of the Soviet government.

965
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Again, this is all spelled out.

966
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But it ends up May 7, the sentence was pronounced of the 17 defendants 11 word to be shot.

967
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Another massive show trial against the engineers that were, again, this goes back to the idea that they were considered records.

968
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And they had these massive show trials. And here were some of the results of the show trials where they, when they sent in these guys to massive prison terms or sentence and to death, thus it was attained with eight horse traction all the goals of the trial.

969
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:48.000
One, all the shortages in the country, including famine called lack of clothing, chaos and obvious stupidities were all blamed on the engineer records.

970
01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The people were terrified by the threat of imminent intervention from abroad and were therefore prepared for new sacrifices. Three left this circles in the west were warned of the intrigues of their governments and for the solidarity of the engineers was destroyed.

971
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
All the intelligence was given a good scare and left divided within itself.

972
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Everyone of these show trials, well, if it wasn't for the fact that people would be imprisoned or executed after the show trials, it would be a lot of them.

973
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:33.000
They seem like kangaroo courts, they seem comical when you read them.

974
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Next chapter called The Supreme Measure, which is about capital punishment, capital punishment has an up and down history in Russia.

975
01:08:46.000 --> 01:09:01.000
In the 20 central provinces of Russia in a period of 16 months from June 1918 to October 1919, more than 6,000 persons were shot, which is to say more than 1,000 per month.

976
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The revolution had hastened to rename everything so that everything would seem new.

977
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Thus, the death penalty was re-crisioned as the supreme measure.

978
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
No longer a punishment, but a means of social defense.

979
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:30.000
So they're executing. A lot of people, of course, they're calling it the supreme measure. They refer to as social defense.

980
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
We're just to say we're just defending ourselves.

981
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Back to the book, and what kind of evil doers with these condemned men's were, did so many plotters and troublemakers come from?

982
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Among them, for example, were six collective farmers who were guilty of the following crime.

983
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:59.000
After they had finished mowing the collective farm with their own hands, they had gone back and mowed a second time along the hummix to get a little hay for their own cows.

984
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The all-Russian Central Executive Committee refused to pardon all six of these peasants and sentenced and the sentence of execution was carried out.

985
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Even if Stalin had killed no others, I believe he deserved to be drawn and cordured just for the wise lives of those six peasants.

986
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So there you go.

987
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:35.000
You already harvested all the grain you can, and then you go out, you do another run to get a little bit of hay for your own cows, and they kill you.

988
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:53.000
During those two years of 1937 and 1938, a half million political prisoners had been shot throughout the Soviet Union and 480,000 habitual thieves in addition.

989
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So we're talking execution on just a mass scale.

990
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's two years, a million, just rattled off.

991
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Three, a million.

992
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Back to the book, and almost always a person obediently allows himself to be killed.

993
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Why is it that the death penalty has such a hypnotic effect? Those pardoned recall hardly anyone in their cell who offered any resistance.

994
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Does hope lend strength or does it weaken a man?

995
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:46.000
That's a good question, isn't it? Does hope lend strength or does it weaken a man?

996
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You had a talk that I witnessed recently, and you mentioned this something you just sort of mentioned for the first time that I heard,

997
01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.000
where you were talking about hell week when you said that they'd say, hey, you don't get much sleep right now.

998
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Oh yeah, and they say, okay, now we're going to give you guys a break, you know, six hours sleep.

999
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah, yeah, no, they'd say something like, hey, look, your hell week has been extra hard, and we went too hard on you by accident,

1000
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
and the water was colder than normal.

1001
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So what we're going to do is we're going to give you guys, we don't normally do this, we're going to give you guys an eight hour recovery period.

1002
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Yeah, so go get put on warm clothes, you know, you're going to go in the barracks.

1003
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You're not going to go in the tents, you're going to go in your barracks, put in your dry clothes, and get in your beds,

1004
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
and you guys will wake you up in eight hours, but we need to do a little training pause right now.

1005
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Yeah, and then, and then they put you, and then they do it, and then they put you in there, and you can all dry, and then they put you in your bed, and then it sounds.

1006
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And then 20 minutes later, they come in with machine guns, and they wake you up and they go get this or again.

1007
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And you do it, and that's one of the things that gets a lot of people to quit.

1008
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Yeah.

1009
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It gets a lot of people to quit.

1010
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Right, so that's kind of the point where, yeah, the hope can jam you up.

1011
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Oh yeah.

1012
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Were that hope, you know, like, oh, I can't believe.

1013
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And then when it's taken away from you real quick, or something like that.

1014
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Oh, yeah, well, this is a great question because think if, okay, if you're in a situation where you could live or die, right?

1015
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
There's times where, hey, if I'm going to die, it makes me stronger like, yeah, I'm going to go out hard.

1016
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Whenever, yeah, but also, like, if I can hope I can live, then that can make you like, like, fight a little bit longer.

1017
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Right.

1018
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Hope of survival.

1019
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah.

1020
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So this hope, lens strength, or does it?

1021
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
We can imagine there's different cases where it does different things to you.

1022
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Yeah.

1023
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Depends on what kind of strength to, I feel like, I don't know, hope of what to do in a life or life.

1024
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It's different, life and death because, you know, death, that's the end of everything.

1025
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That's like, you know, but like, yeah, but think about this situation.

1026
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You're, this is a talk about death.

1027
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Like, you're going to be executed.

1028
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So let me ask you this.

1029
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So you're going to be executed.

1030
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But there's, if there's a little bit of hope that, oh, maybe the sentence will get overturned.

1031
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Or maybe I'll get pushed down the road or maybe they'll do an amnesty and I'll get out.

1032
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
That's hope, right?

1033
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So that might weaken you.

1034
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Right.

1035
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Because if you're like, look, I'm getting executed.

1036
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And I don't care. And you know what, when that guard comes in here, it's not to get some of my buddies and we're going to get after it.

1037
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Oh, yeah.

1038
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Right. So that's going to make you stronger.

1039
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So hope might not necessarily be a good thing.

1040
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I mean, you know, if you ever encountered someone that I've had no hope, they can be very scary individuals.

1041
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Because they don't care if they live or die.

1042
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
They don't think to lose.

1043
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Nothing to lose. Yes.

1044
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Nothing to lose.

1045
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Nothing to lose.

1046
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
You ever see a sports game where it can go like a team gets to go.

1047
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It can go like a team gets a good lead.

1048
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And then they just start taking risks and they start dominating.

1049
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Right.

1050
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yeah.

1051
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I mean, it can happen where they get started in cocky.

1052
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Right.

1053
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
But like you can see a sports game where if it happens in fights, it happens in amnesty fights.

1054
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yeah.

1055
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I start getting the upper hand.

1056
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It happens in Gigietsu.

1057
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I start getting the upper hand.

1058
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I take a little bit more risk.

1059
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
But the risk as long as the risk pay off.

1060
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
That now all some in your, if you and I are rolling, I take a little risk.

1061
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Like I go for the take down. Right.

1062
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I'm feeling cocky. Go for the take down.

1063
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Yeah.

1064
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
I get the take down.

1065
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Right.

1066
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Now all of a sudden your, your hope goes down.

1067
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Yeah.

1068
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Right.

1069
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And mine's going up.

1070
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
You're more and more. Yeah.

1071
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But if you're really tired and the rounds almost over and you already lost.

1072
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And now you're just like, well, I got no hope.

1073
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I'm just going to try for an arm lock.

1074
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
You might get it.

1075
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Yeah.

1076
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yeah.

1077
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And that's what I was going to say to us like man, it's on both sides.

1078
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
So it just depends.

1079
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Both really the answers book because like look, MMM analogy. Good one.

1080
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
My opinion to where let's say I'm down as a football team as a whatever.

1081
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
You start throwing Hail Mary's doing that kind of stuff.

1082
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You know, it's like you have kind of less hope.

1083
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
We're going to lose anyway. Nothing will lose situation.

1084
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So it does give you strength in that way.

1085
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
But at the same time, if you weigh ahead, yeah,

1086
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I can take my risk. I'll put my second string guys in there.

1087
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Give them some wraps.

1088
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Whatever.

1089
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Because if, you know, if the if the risk doesn't pay off, whatever.

1090
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
We're still ahead.

1091
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So we're, you know, man, I don't know.

1092
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Yeah, just he can.

1093
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
You know what you, you know, I think the thing is here,

1094
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
you got to pay attention as a human to what the hope is doing to you.

1095
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Right?

1096
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
It's just get this good lesson learned to what is the hope doing.

1097
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Because it happens in your life, too, right?

1098
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Like maybe you're like, I got a job and you're like, like, I might get that promotion.

1099
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So I'm just going to stick it out.

1100
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Yeah.

1101
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You're going to stick it out a little bit longer.

1102
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Yeah.

1103
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
And then, but whereas if you're like, hey, you're not getting promoted, you be like, all right.

1104
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You don't want to do something to get my resume together.

1105
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'm going to get my act together.

1106
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I'm going to put that word if you have hope it makes you a little weaker.

1107
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah.

1108
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
So you got to pay attention to it.

1109
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
But it could make you stronger though.

1110
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You'd be like, oh, I might get the promotion.

1111
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So I'm going to do something to work.

1112
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
All right, right?

1113
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
You've got to pay attention to what the hope is doing to you.

1114
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
That's what you got to do.

1115
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Yeah.

1116
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
That's great.

1117
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Hope isn't always good.

1118
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
It's not bad.

1119
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It's not good.

1120
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You get to figure out.

1121
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You got to monitor your hope.

1122
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Don't get your hopes up.

1123
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Yeah.

1124
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
That kind of situation.

1125
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I go.

1126
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You had to monitor that hope.

1127
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Oh, man.

1128
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
There you go.

1129
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
There you go.

1130
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
There continues on.

1131
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Here we go.

1132
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.24
If the condemned men in every cell had ganked up on the executioners as they came in and

1133
01:17:10.24 --> 01:17:12.000
choked them.

1134
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Wouldn't this have ended executioners sooner than the appeals to the all Russian central

1135
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
executive committee?

1136
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
When one is already on the edge of the grave, why not resist?

1137
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But wasn't everything for doomed anyway from the moment of arrest.

1138
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And all the arrested crawled along the path of hope on their knees as if their legs had

1139
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000
been amputated.

1140
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Monitor your hope.

1141
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Monitor it all.

1142
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
He describes sort of death row in one of the prisons.

1143
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
There were four death cells in this prison in the same corridor as the juvenile cells

1144
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and the hospital cells.

1145
01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Death cells had two doors.

1146
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
The customary wouldn't door with a people and door made of iron grading.

1147
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Each door had two locks.

1148
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And one jailer had the block supervisor.

1149
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Each had a key.

1150
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:19.000
One jailer and if the block supervisor each had a key to a different one, so the doors could only be opened by the two together.

1151
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Cell 43 was on the other side of a wall of the interrogator's office.

1152
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And at night while the condemned men were waiting to be executed, their ears were tormented by the screams of prisoners being tortured.

1153
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And that's what we're talking about.

1154
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:03.000
From our experience in the past and our literature of the past, we have derived a naive faith in the power of a hunger strike.

1155
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But the hunger strike is purely a moral weapon.

1156
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.000
It presupposes that the jailer has not entirely lost his conscience.

1157
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Or that the jailer is afraid of public opinion.

1158
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Only in such circumstances can it be effective.

1159
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So yeah, so he, President, didn't care.

1160
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Say whatever you want.

1161
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We control the press.

1162
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Oh, and by the way, you think I'm going to feel guilty that you're starving?

1163
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
No, I'm not a driver.

1164
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Oh, and by the way, if I do feel like I want to make you live, guess what they did.

1165
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Forced artificial feeding.

1166
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
This method was adapted without any question from the experience with wild animals in captivity.

1167
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Artificial feeding has much in common with rape.

1168
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And that's what it really is for big men, hurl themselves on one week being in the private of its one introduction.

1169
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
They only need to do it once and what happens to it next is not important.

1170
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:13.000
The element of rape in here's in the violation of the victims will.

1171
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It's not going to be the way you want it, but the way I want it.

1172
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Lie down and submit.

1173
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:30.000
They pry open the mouth with a flat disk, then broaden the crack between the jaw and insert a tube, swallow it.

1174
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And if you don't swallow it, they shove it down farther anyway, and then pour liquified food right down the esophagus.

1175
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And then they massage the stomach to prevent the prisoner from resorting to vomiting.

1176
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
The sensation is one of being morally defiled.

1177
01:20:51.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And this is, it's the closing of this part of the book.

1178
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000
We no longer know the answer to the question, is the soul of a person in the new type prison?

1179
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000
In the special purpose prison, purified or does it perish once and for all?

1180
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:38.000
If the first thing you see each and every morning is the eyes of your cellmate who is gone insane,

1181
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:53.000
how then shall you save yourself during the coming day?

1182
01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:07.000
And like I said, that's, I'll take that as a spot to close out that part one of this book about the Gulag.

1183
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And I think that is a question that we can ask ourselves a lot in our current world.

1184
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But how can we save ourselves every day when you look around at the world?

1185
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:44.000
When it looks, sometimes the world is going insane. When people are going crazy, you have to kind of work to save yourself every day.

1186
01:22:44.000 --> 01:23:01.000
You have to pull yourself back into sanity and back onto the path and not allow yourself to become a prisoner of your own personal Gulag.

1187
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And these Gulags, these Soviet Gulags, if you want to build your own personal Gulag in your life, you do it the same way that the Soviets did it.

1188
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000
You do it with lies.

1189
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Lies on top of lies. When the Soviets lied on top of lies to build these Gulags in your life, if you lie to yourself, if you allow that to happen and you put lies on top of lies, you will build yourself your own personal Gulag.

1190
01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:03.000
So don't allow it. Don't lie to yourself.

1191
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And instead, keep yourself out of that prison.

1192
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:23.000
And keep yourself free by telling yourself the truth.

1193
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And I think that's, oh, I've got fort tonight and I know echo you've got some ways that we can kind of help.

1194
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Keep ourselves free by staying on the path.

1195
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Sure, on top of telling the truth, on top of telling the truth, which is where.

1196
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah. Kind of the key, right? The key element.

1197
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
It's a key element for sure.

1198
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Still kind of tripping on the hope thing, you know, if that gives you strength or takes it from you, right? That's all you put it or that's all you put it, right?

1199
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It takes it from you.

1200
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I was, I was talking to Dakota, the other night, and we were talking about after the big event, you know, where he lost his team and all that.

1201
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And we just talked a little bit more detail about, if you remember in the book a few days later, he goes on another operation. That's just as crazy.

1202
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Or maybe not just as crazy, but it's like, it's really bad.

1203
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And he was doing some definitely some crazy things and putting, what's the military term that we say?

1204
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:45.000
He was going above and beyond the Call of Duty and putting himself at great risk.

1205
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And I said to him, you know, we were kind of like, you know, Dakota's so good to go and so awesome.

1206
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
And we were just like laughing. And I was like, you didn't, I mean at that point, I'm like, you just, you know, you lost your whole team.

1207
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I go, you didn't care if you lived or died, he goes, not at all.

1208
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And so in that situation, like he had no hope at that moment in time.

1209
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And guess what he did? Whatever he had to do. He's like, oh, I got to go save the, I'm going to go run across open field, whether it was machine gun fire coming cool, I'll go.

1210
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Oh, wait, I knew to do it again, I'll go again. Oh, I knew to do it again, I'll go again.

1211
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Yeah. Because he didn't have hope and in fact, that he didn't have hope gave him strength at that moment.

1212
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Yeah.

1213
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You know, at that moment, but if you talk to him now, it's reversed. He's got his kids, got his little daughters.

1214
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yeah. You know what I mean? He's got like hope for the future.

1215
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Yeah.

1216
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And that's what makes him strong right now.

1217
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
So keep him strong.

1218
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah. So I mean, what's the formula, right? And I mean, it's the formula is monitor your home.

1219
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That's the formula.

1220
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And it depends on who you are, right? Because they consider yourself, let's say, I'll hope it's lost.

1221
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
You know, I got to, you know, go across do all these crazy things above and beyond.

1222
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I could be, if I have a different attitude, I could be like, why, why fight it kind of thing,

1223
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
but death, impending doom, you know, just kind of take its course kind of thing.

1224
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Right? I mean, could, yeah.

1225
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
That could be disregard for his own safety. That's the phrase I was looking for.

1226
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Yeah.

1227
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's a complete disregard for his own safety.

1228
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Yeah.

1229
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But that's like a specific approach. You know, that's like a different attitude.

1230
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000
You know, like some people, they'll be like, oh, I'm going to, you know, like, I'm doomed anyway.

1231
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So why fight it?

1232
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yeah.

1233
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yeah.

1234
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Right.

1235
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Like I'm doomed.

1236
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So I'm going to just start swinging for the person.

1237
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But check this out.

1238
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
You could also be like, I hope I can make it out of here.

1239
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to hide right here and do anything.

1240
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Yeah.

1241
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So that's the same, just like the reverse.

1242
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
It's the reverse.

1243
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So it's like, and then if you're in a bad situation and you're like, well, I hope I can make it.

1244
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I've got hope that I can live through this situation.

1245
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
So I'm just going to get down.

1246
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
I'm just going to hide.

1247
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I'm going to get behind this little rock outcropping and hope this goes away.

1248
01:27:59.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Right.

1249
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Hope they don't see me.

1250
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Hope, you know, the whole, hope, hope.

1251
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yeah.

1252
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
That's the example of the whole.

1253
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And guess what happens when you do that?

1254
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Let me maneuver something. You and you get killed.

1255
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Whereas if you go like, you know what?

1256
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm going out.

1257
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I have no hope.

1258
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm going to attack.

1259
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But by the way, the enemy who's hoping they can take you and hoping that you're going to stay there.

1260
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
When you, when you do something that they didn't hope for, that's going to smack them in the face.

1261
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Yeah.

1262
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000
But like, if, but then on the, on the reverse side of that, right, let's say you have a different attitude.

1263
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Even though you have hope, right, if all is lost, do you think,

1264
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
but I have this little shred of hope, so I'm just going to go throw a hail, Mary.

1265
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Yeah.

1266
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:39.000
That's hope.

1267
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Yeah.

1268
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Really, rather than just like, covering in the corner and dying or whatever.

1269
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Yes, but you wouldn't be throwing a hail, Mary, unless that was the only way.

1270
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Like, that was your only hope shred of hope.

1271
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
That was your only hope.

1272
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.000
That was your only hope.

1273
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
That's what I'm saying.

1274
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Like, if you have two different approaches, you know,

1275
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
monitor your hope at the end of the day.

1276
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
You kind of got to monitor your hope.

1277
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I've got to make sure that what?

1278
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Because there's, you got to be careful too, because sometimes, you know,

1279
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
if you have no hope, right, if you out, well, I have no hope.

1280
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
So I'm just, because you could do that, right,

1281
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
let's say you're in a bad situation, a combat situation.

1282
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Hey, I got no hope, so I'm just going to lay here and like,

1283
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I guess that's what you were saying.

1284
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah.

1285
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Oh, yeah.

1286
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I got no hope, so I'm just going to lay here.

1287
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah.

1288
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Instead of, hey, I got no hope, so I'm just going to go out,

1289
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
you know, blaze and glory.

1290
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Let's get something.

1291
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yeah.

1292
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Go down this way.

1293
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Go down this way.

1294
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
So if you monitor it, you go wait a second.

1295
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I have no hope.

1296
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Okay, I'm going to at least go out hard.

1297
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I'm going to go get some.

1298
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Add a minimum, right?

1299
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I'm going to take some people with me.

1300
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Bad guys.

1301
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Yeah.

1302
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Save some of my good guys.

1303
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
If I can do that.

1304
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Yeah, that's good.

1305
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
As opposed to having no hope, we're doomed.

1306
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Yeah.

1307
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Monitor your hope.

1308
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Remember the, remember Shawshank redemption?

1309
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Yes, I have seen them.

1310
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Remember he said that where he was like, hey,

1311
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
the guy read market agreement.

1312
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
He's saying, hey, don't be careful with that.

1313
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Hope thing.

1314
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It'll drive you insane or something like that.

1315
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Like if you hope you'll get out or you hope you're going to get part

1316
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
into whatever his situation was.

1317
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
So it's like, yeah, if you hope you'll get part in and you hold onto that

1318
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
hope, but you get let down, it'll create, you know, it'll drive you insane.

1319
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And if you don't have hope in that, this, the what he's

1320
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
implying, if you don't have hope, you just it basically

1321
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000
accept your imprisonment so you can focus on or concentrate on living prison life,

1322
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
you know, the way it needs to be lived.

1323
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
So let's be.

1324
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Do the best you can there.

1325
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Yeah, like don't have these hopes of the outside because it'll make you crazy.

1326
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That could be decent advice in a situation like that.

1327
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Yeah, one of those deals that monitor your hope is what he was saying.

1328
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
That's what he was saying.

1329
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah, he was saying monitor your hope.

1330
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Because right, if you have no hope, you can be like, well,

1331
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I'm just going to just going to kill myself.

1332
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

1333
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah, like a monitor.

1334
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
No, you got a monitor in the prison.

1335
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Right.

1336
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
And you got to make sure that you're not putting yourself in a personal prison.

1337
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah.

1338
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Which, which that to me, this idea, if you think about the bad situations in your life,

1339
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
most of them are predicated on you lying to yourself about something.

1340
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah.

1341
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah, you're every day ones for sure.

1342
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Yeah, right.

1343
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Yeah.

1344
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
It's weird.

1345
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Every time you, like, you say something like that, how are we trying to think of some

1346
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
rebuttal?

1347
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
You know, it's weird.

1348
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I feel like I'm doing that.

1349
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But yeah, no, you're right.

1350
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yeah.

1351
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I think so.

1352
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
But you just tell these little lies.

1353
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Yeah.

1354
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Lies on top of lies.

1355
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Yeah.

1356
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And what's, what I think what happens with lies on top of lies is they become easier

1357
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
and easier to believe.

1358
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Like once you believe one of your own lies, then you believe three, then you believe

1360
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
ten, then you believe a hundred.

1361
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah, you know what the feeling is?

1362
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
The feeling is you lied to yourself, right?

1363
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And or you could a lot of times lying to yourself isn't like, hey, I'm tall.

1364
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
When you're not tall, it's not that.

1365
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It's like, it's more of a not admitting certain things.

1366
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
That's more of what it is.

1367
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
You know, like when you saw how you guys say, you say, take a good hard look at yourself

1368
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
and then don't lie to yourself.

1369
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Right.

1370
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So it's usually when you lie to yourself in the mirror, it's like, oh, I won't admit that.

1371
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I won't admit that to myself that I need this, right?

1372
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Yeah.

1373
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Whatever.

1374
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
That's how the lie comes, you know, it's lie by omission.

1375
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Yeah, but then the more you do it.

1376
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Yeah, but then you, and then you live to see another day, hello, it's a miracle.

1377
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
So it must kind of be true.

1378
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
It must not be that big of a deal, my whatever.

1379
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You know, my donuts that I eat every morning for breakfast must not be.

1380
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I'm still here.

1381
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Close your eyes.

1382
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
This seems safe.

1383
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Yeah.

1384
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
So it is so, it no one's bringing it up.

1385
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
No one's bringing it up to me kind of thing.

1386
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It's not really, it's not like pulling at me that much.

1387
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
So it gets easier and easier to kind of, it's almost like sweeping it under the rug kind of thing.

1388
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
You know, meanwhile it's a fast-streaming, and fast-streaming.

1389
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Oh, she's going to deduct your cholesterol, it's all high or whatever.

1390
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
So you'm saying, that's how it'll jam you up.

1391
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Don't lie to yourself.

1392
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
You know what else is it, prison?

1393
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Being on bottom stuck in your side control.

1394
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Indue to prison.

1395
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
So, and here's the weird thing when you, when you said that,

1396
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I did think of this, where if I have, and it's, I don't even know if I'd call it hope.

1397
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Like, if I want to be out, like if I want to escape,

1398
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
not that I want to do the escape or take escape tight actions,

1399
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
it's just, I don't want to be there.

1400
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I'll like it way less, like I won't.

1401
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I won't be able to deal with it as much as if I say, okay.

1402
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm here, it's like accepting that I'm on the same side control, you know?

1403
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And I have to take action here.

1404
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
My hope is here, not outside there, so you have to accept the situation that you're in.

1405
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Yes.

1406
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Can't lie to yourself.

1407
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Can't lie to yourself.

1408
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
A little person.

1409
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Anyway, I think that's what Morgan Freeman was talking about, by the way.

1410
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Nonetheless, it's been a side control.

1411
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
That's GG2.

1412
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.000
It's been a GG2.

1413
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
You're going to need a G if you're doing GG2 indeed.

1414
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Yeah.

1415
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
We're on the path.

1416
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
We're talking about the path right now, right?

1417
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Support yourself in this way by saying in the path starting GG2.

1418
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
If you haven't already, a lot of people starting GG2.

1419
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
A lot more people.

1420
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Yeah.

1421
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Starting GG2.

1422
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's a getting popular.

1423
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Very popular.

1424
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And for good reason too, I mean, shoot.

1425
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So when you get a G, and a rashguard, get an origin G.

1426
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
No question.

1427
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Oh, you don't want to agree with me.

1428
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Okay, I agree with you on a person.

1429
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
That's what I thought.

1430
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Anyway, good.

1431
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Origin main.com.

1432
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Yeah.

1433
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Origin main.com.

1434
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.50
I guess the look that I was giving you is sort of the fact that we just glossed

1435
01:34:45.50 --> 01:34:49.000
over the fact that these G's are made 100% in America.

1436
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
You're even talking about that.

1437
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Yeah.

1438
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Yeah, maybe I should talk about that.

1439
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Well, last time you did, you talked about the looms and all that stuff.

1440
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Today you're just like, hey, the best G's.

1441
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Which I guess that's cool.

1442
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Yeah.

1443
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000
They are.

1444
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
All is true for sure.

1445
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
100%.

1446
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Yeah.

1447
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And you know what?

1448
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
I'm just about to say this, but I remember that I do talk about this all the time.

1449
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000
On air and off air that it is cool.

1450
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
It kind of like how Pete guys how they brought back like.

1451
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
The actual making of the G for example.

1452
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Yeah.

1453
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Like that's a thing now.

1454
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
It's like cool now.

1455
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Yeah.

1456
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
No one cared about how your G was stitched and like, no.

1457
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I'm not cared about that stuff.

1458
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Even if they knew the Pearl competitions.

1459
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I last time I was there was I got like legit.

1460
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Explonation of things from Pete because Pete and I were just like,

1461
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
it's 10 o'clock at night.

1462
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
We've been working for eight days straight and we're just in there getting.

1463
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And I'm asking pointed questions about stuff about how this thing gets.

1464
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
You know what I mean?

1465
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
If I want to understand it.

1466
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Yeah.

1467
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
There's a lot of those guys that had to learn a lot of stuff.

1468
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Bro, you can't even.

1469
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
It's I think it's been five years, six years.

1470
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
The amount of information that had to be learned from.

1471
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
From no, from nothing.

1472
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
No, from trial and error.

1473
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
It's a funny, ask Pete that can stuff like, you can't exhaust Pete.

1474
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Oh no, that's stupid.

1475
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Oh yeah, you see the twinkle in his eye.

1476
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Yeah.

1477
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
You know, he wants to explain it.

1478
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
He's all, oh, I was concerned.

1479
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I was boring.

1480
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You guys with it.

1481
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
No, man.

1482
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Stay off to that for sure.

1483
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
But yeah.

1484
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Origin G 100% origin raskard 100% supplements to fire the way.

1485
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Yeah.

1486
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And I wasn't not.

1487
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I wouldn't come myself anti supplement.

1488
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I'm not going to say that.

1489
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
But it wasn't into supplements that much before.

1490
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Now I am because you know when you come across the one that actually works.

1491
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
That's the thing, you know, helping the plenty of people there or plenty of supplements.

1492
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
It's they sort of rely.

1493
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Maybe not 100% maybe 100% but they rely on the placebo effect.

1494
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:55.000
So when you have supplements like these that actually work, you become a supplement person.

1495
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yeah.

1496
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So if you want to have joint warfare for your joints, obviously,

1497
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Criolloial for your life, like,

1498
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
including your joints, including your just overall health discipline.

1499
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
For when you got to get that workout and there's discipline drink and there's discipline.

1500
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Go pills go go and then it was milk.

1501
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
You had some kind of mocks in there.

1502
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You're going on.

1503
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Yeah.

1504
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Technically it was warrior kid mocks last night.

1505
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
We go to.

1506
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Okay.

1507
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
There's this light show. Christmas light show.

1508
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
You know, the certain neighbors that I guess this one is like super famous.

1509
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Oh, like shoot tracers.

1510
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
No.

1511
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
In a loom girl.

1512
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
No, but no, right.

1513
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Yeah.

1514
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
It's called the, I think ballardo.

1515
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I think it's called ballardo light show.

1516
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
It's like, you know, Christmas lights is how they do everything.

1517
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
It has a whole show.

1518
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
People, you know, so we go and, you know, my wife.

1519
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
She likes the Christmas spirit.

1520
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Get all cozy, right?

1521
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
It's kind of cold there now.

1522
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
California cold.

1523
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I dig it.

1524
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
No offense.

1525
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
No offense.

1526
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
No offense.

1527
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Iowa.

1528
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
No offense.

1529
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Maine.

1530
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
No offense.

1531
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
But California cold.

1532
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
We'll say you can see your breath.

1533
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
That's something.

1534
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
You're talking 40 49 degrees.

1535
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
50.

1536
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yeah.

1537
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yeah.

1538
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So why?

1539
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Like in like Michigan or Minnesota.

1540
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
It's 54 below in Montana.

1541
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
It's 54 below zero.

1542
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So anyways, continue.

1543
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
A little bit different.

1544
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Sure.

1545
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000
But still.

1546
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
But for the Charles family.

1547
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You want to be a little silly.

1548
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Up according to my wife, it warranted maybe a hot chocolate scenario.

1549
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So look, this is where we need to driver.

1550
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
It's kind of close amounts.

1551
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
We'll drive around.

1552
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
We'll look at all the nice lights.

1553
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
We'll drink our chocolate and the car will bring the kid to be fun.

1554
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You can get out.

1555
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So everyone's busing out their hot chocolate.

1556
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Of course what, what do you think my hot chocolate was?

1557
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah.

1558
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Oh, I know what it was.

1559
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
That's the warrior kid.

1560
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Moke hot chocolate.

1561
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I even put some whipped cream on the.

1562
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Oh, yeah.

1563
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
It's nice.

1564
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Actually, it was surprisingly nice.

1565
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Because they had that well, I was this is why.

1566
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Usually I drink the regular moke under different circumstances.

1567
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
This is like, oh, milkshake.

1568
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Boom.

1569
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You know, but you get to get considered as consider where I was.

1570
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I had two two kids and one wife always regular hot chocolate.

1571
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Mairman out of head marshmallows in it.

1572
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Either way, regular hot chocolate.

1573
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And me, I'm with the, okay, I'm going to stick with the protein.

1574
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
You were a kid.

1575
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So you didn't get your kids didn't have night of me.

1576
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
That's, that's messed up.

1577
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Here's the thing.

1578
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Yeah, you kids.

1579
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Yeah.

1580
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Yeah.

1581
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Oh, I was younger.

1582
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I was gunna, but we're kind of in a hurry.

1583
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
So, and I made the like the game time.

1584
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Life, it was already made.

1585
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I'm not going to be like, hey, you know.

1586
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Either way, actually, that's a good point next time.

1587
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
100%.

1588
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Unless I heated up, taste the same.

1589
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Yeah.

1590
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Literally taste the same.

1591
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Yeah.

1592
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Same is right.

1593
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
How chocolate.

1594
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So anyways, that's warrior kid.

1595
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I was like, I was like, oh, cool.

1596
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I was like, anybody had it?

1597
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
No, like one of those metal water bottle looking thing.

1598
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And I go, what did you mix it with?

1599
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
And he's like water and I go broke.

1600
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
You got to get milk in there.

1601
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And he goes really?

1602
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
And I go, yeah.

1603
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I go almond milk, coconut milk.

1604
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
What other kind of milk, are there?

1605
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
almond milk, coconut milk.

1606
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I said, just get some acid or home milk.

1607
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Just milk or skim milk.

1608
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Whatever.

1609
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And then I said, I said, just get some acid or home milk.

1610
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Just milk or skim milk.

1611
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Whatever.

1612
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I saw him yesterday.

1613
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
He said, bro.

1614
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Yeah.

1615
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
You were even kidding.

1616
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And I'm like, he was no home drink in it all the time.

1617
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And I go, yeah, I know.

1618
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And he was actually telling me he liked it.

1619
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Just as his water, which I can't, I can't, I'm not going to make that claim

1620
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
because I don't believe it.

1621
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Right?

1622
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
I'm not saying like, hey, if you drink with water, it's going to be great.

1623
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
If you drink with water, it's okay.

1624
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
It's like, like I said before, drink with water.

1625
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It's like a ham sandwich.

1626
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Like, it's not, if you drink it with milk, it's like prime rib.

1627
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Yeah.

1628
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
It's like a rib.

1629
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
I don't know what he was doing.

1630
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I know he's exact scenario and I wasn't even there.

1631
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
I don't even know what you're talking to him.

1632
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
He's used to drinking protein, drink shakes in the shaker.

1633
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
You know, after you live, make someone just throw it in with water.

1634
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Whatever.

1635
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
That's what he's doing.

1636
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

1637
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Put the tube open it with an open mouth with it.

1638
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Yes, get a scammer tube down your soft against to get your protein.

1639
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
You don't need to do that with milk.

1640
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
There's no forced feeding.

1641
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
But that's what I'm saying.

1642
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So now he mixed it same deal, same routine.

1643
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
But now we got the milk, taste better, cool.

1644
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Put it in.

1645
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Oh yeah, right?

1646
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.000
So the guy who wears jacco, let me find the middle kind of thing.

1647

You're saying rather than in a Kabu,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I don't know, I'm not sure.

1651
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I'm sure.

1652
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Man.

1653
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000

1669
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000
he's a funny enough, my wife is, she's on.

1670
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Is there a jacco white tea train?

1671
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
This is not.

1672
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
But if there was, she would be the engineer.

1673
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Oh, that one.

1674
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And she'll even say, I'm about to get after it, right?

1675
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
First.

1676
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Yeah, I guess this is why you can't create viral marketing.

1677
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Right?

1678
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You can't be like, hey, let's come up with a viral thing for a jacco white tea.

1679
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Hey, get on the jacco white tea train.

1680
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Like that doesn't work.

1681
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Sure.

1682
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Yeah, I guess no.

1683
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Where's malt train?

1684
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
100%.

1685
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Well, the malt train showed it just formulated itself.

1686
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's what I mean.

1687
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1688
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It just, it pre-existed in some, you know,

1689
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
a person that went in arrived here.

1690
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
It was like, you too, get off.

1691
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Oh, check.

1692
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Anyway, jacco white tea.

1693
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Yes, deadlift 8,000 pounds.

1694
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Whatever.

1695
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I've been deadlifting 8,000 pounds for a long time already.

1696
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
So that is less exciting than it's going to be for the, you know,

1697
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
the people who just start just saying, but yeah.

1698
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Sure.

1699
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Somebody asked you a deadlift 1,600 pounds if you, if you drink two cans.

1700
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Oh, no, you just, yeah.

1701
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah.

1702
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I like to say this, but no.

1703
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
That's what I've done in the work that way.

1704
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Yeah, no.

1705
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Exactly.

1706
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Exactly.

1707
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Right.

1708
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Nonetheless, in cans and in jacco white tea,

1709
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
yeah, it just prefer the cans personally, but the dry taste.

1710
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's good, too.

So you can get some of that.

1731

Also, you can get that Warrior Kid soap from Irish Oaks Ranch,

1732
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.000

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Yeah.

1734
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
So if you want to get some soap, so you can follow his motto,

1735
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
which is stay clean.

1736
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And then YouTube.

1737
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Subscribe to YouTube if you want to see what echo Charles looks like.

1738
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Sure.

1739
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.000
If you want to see what a guest looks like.

1740
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.000
If you want to see the look on echo's face when I say something that he doesn't agree with.

1741
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Or if you want to see the look on my face when he says something.

1742
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:44.000
That was one of the funniest outtakes was he talking.

1743
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And then you'd, but you were just showing my face just like so bored and annoyed and just.

1744
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
There's a few, those, there's one where I was talking about justifying,

1745
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
like not doing squats or something.

1746
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Or whatever and you're just like this.

1747
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I thought the funny thing was when you were talking about something

1748
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and then alien thing.

1749
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Oh, yeah.

1750
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
You just show my face and I'm just looking at you like,

1751
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
like please get the hint that my face right now means stop.

1752
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
But you were actually really nice about that.

1753
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I'm a generally nice person.

1754
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah, that's your own pretty nice person.

1755
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Well, sometimes you take advantage of that with stories that impinge on my whole situation.

1756
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Anyway, psychological warfare, which that's what that is by the way.

1757
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
When you're just looking at me, not yawning, nothing like that just looking at like it's psychological.

1758
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
It's psychological up communication.

1759
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Anyway, the real psychological warfare is an album with tracks of Jockel.

1760
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:47.000
On each track telling you how to overcome your moments of weakness that may, may creep into your whole scenario in life when you're on the path.

1761
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
You can get that on iTunes, Google Play and B3 platform or whatever.

1762
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
You know what, I said we're going to get psychological warfare to out by Christmas.

1763
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Not going to happen.

1764
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Little delay if you still have some requests of an area of weakness.

1765
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And you want us to make a psychological warfare tracks that you can crush and destroy that weakness.

1766
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Then just let us know via the usual means.

1767
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Yes.

1768
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yeah, online.

1769
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Cool.

1770
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah, all your excuses are lies.

1771
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
By the way, that's the working title.

1772
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Also, very up your workout.

1773
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I was going to do a video today.

1774
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
We'll work out video of yourself.

1775
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yep.

1776
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And I was going to do a kettlebell typical kettlebell scenario.

1777
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And I was just going to start doing curls with it.

1778
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But, but I decided against it because it's kind of disrespectful to the people.

1779
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I just got a good idea.

1780
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:49.000
You should do a workout video where you just have a barbell kettlebell, a dumbbell, a sandbag, and everything.

1781
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
You just do a curl.

1782
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Yeah.

1783
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
That was essentially the idea.

1784
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Yeah.

1785
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
It's kind of disrespectful.

1786
01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Anyway, my point there being what it reminded me of is that the curl.

1787
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
It was going to be like really good like produced video.

1788
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Not necessarily with a good camera, nothing like that.

1789
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
But just like I'm just going to frame it good.

1790
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000
And it is going to be using the on a kettlebell, the sideclubs, whatever.

1791
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.000
The on the last decided against it because it's going to be kind of disrespectful because that's not what kettlebell is for.

1792
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Obviously.

1793
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But if you do get kettlebell, even if it's funny, it still disrespectful.

1794
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I just want it felt like at the time, but no, you're probably right.

1795
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I just time I was like, yeah.

1796
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Yeah.

1797
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Yeah.

1798
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Anyway, my point is even though it's a little bit beside the point, it reminded me of it.

1799
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000
The point is, my new point is, when you want to vary up your workout, curls, or otherwise, some people they don't even do curls.

1800
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I actually do curls.

1801
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
You say do curls too.

1802
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Don't act like you don't.

1803
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
No, I do.

1804
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Boom, get your stuff from on it.com slash jockel by the way kettlebell rings.

1805
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
These are things that I don't do.

1806
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
I do pretty much every workout pretty much.

1807
01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But this is these are ones that I strongly recommend to incorporate rings.

1808
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And this last thing you can do on rings by the way.

1809
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Pushups, pull ups, and the planks, whatever.

1810
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Those are the tips.

1811
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Dips, yeah.

1812
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
I don't do them as much, but the planks for sure.

1813
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
You don't do dips.

1814
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Not on the rings.

1815
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
No why?

1816
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I don't know.

1817
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I just don't know.

1818
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Okay, it's dome on the bar.

1819
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Not on the last.

1820
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Good job.

1821
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
These are these dang bro.

1822
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Those are a lot of heat right there for no dips on the rings.

1823
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Anyway, get them at on it.

1824
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Good stuff on there.

1825
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Very up the workout.

1826
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Incorporate new things in the workout.

1827
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Yeah, man.

1828
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It's good.

1829
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Mikey in the dragons.

1830
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Is out.

1831
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
It is in stock fully.

1832
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm sorry that it took a little late.

1833

Everyone should have gotten it by your should get it by Christmas.

1834
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.000
If you ordered it reasonably before Christmas, you should have it because we made it.

1835
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
We did it.

1836
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Everyone that ordered it.

1837
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
We got an Amazon fulfilled.

1838
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So I appreciate everyone that ordered it.

1839
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
It is now fully in stock.

1840
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
We should not run out again.

1841
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Well, if you have Amazon Prime, that's like two days, right?

1842
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Yes.

1843
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Yeah, I don't know.

1844
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000
I don't know when.

1845
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Yeah, I don't know when.

1846
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I don't know when you've got the new items for Amazon to get it shipped in time.

1847
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Yeah.

1848
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But yeah, those are in the distribution centers around the country with Amazon Prime right now.

1849
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000
So if you haven't gotten Mikey in the dragons for every kid that you know, then you can get it done right now.

1850
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
We got a lot of copies ready to roll.

1851
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
So get it for your kids.

1852

Get it for your neighbors kids.

1853
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Get it for your library.

1854
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Whatever.

1855
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
You can also get the way of the Warrior Kid books.

1856
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Way of the Warrior Kid and Mark's mission.

1857
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
If you want your kids or kids.

1858
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.82
kids you know to actually have a good life. This is a great way to start them off

1859
01:49:41.82 --> 01:49:47.72
actually having a good life. Another, this is a holiday gift if there ever

1860
01:49:47.72 --> 01:49:52.02
one was one. Displung equals freedom, I need to post that video actually. I'll post

1861
01:49:52.02 --> 01:49:58.14
that video. Repost. Oh, yeah, yeah. Get that video posted. But yeah, because

1862
01:49:58.14 --> 01:50:01.40
that's a good gift to give anyone that needs to be on the first and the

1863
01:50:01.40 --> 01:50:04.94
one. If you want to get the audio version of that, it's not on

1864
01:50:04.94 --> 01:50:09.02
audible. It's on iTunes Amazon, use a Google play at SETRA,

1865
01:50:09.02 --> 01:50:14.62
extreme ownership. Of course, dichotomy leadership possibly better than

1866
01:50:14.62 --> 01:50:21.26
extreme ownership. I've gotten like four last four people I talked to. I was like,

1867
01:50:21.26 --> 01:50:25.90
no, possibly. They're like, no, it's definitely better. And that's kind of weird.

1868
01:50:25.90 --> 01:50:29.50
Right? Yes, is that. Yeah. Well, you guys, you guys might be going to

1869
01:50:29.50 --> 01:50:33.42
go flare up. You know what I mean? Maybe, but I don't really get that from what

1870
01:50:33.42 --> 01:50:38.54
you just said right now. I, here's my hypothesis. The people who are saying

1871
01:50:38.54 --> 01:50:41.34
that dichotomy leadership is better than extreme ownership, better than

1872
01:50:41.34 --> 01:50:45.50
extreme ownership, or people who read extreme ownership. And then we're like,

1873
01:50:45.50 --> 01:50:49.18
yeah, you know, hell, yeah, I'm an extreme ownership. And then they go in

1874
01:50:49.18 --> 01:50:53.18
and they're like, okay, it's like, you know, like, I made the analogy of the

1875
01:50:53.18 --> 01:50:58.46
guy on major league, right? The picture. He had all this power. But he

1876
01:50:58.46 --> 01:51:02.22
have any control. dichotomy leadership comes in. Kism that control that

1877
01:51:02.22 --> 01:51:06.70
they wish that they had. Yeah, they didn't even know they didn't have it. They thought

1878
01:51:06.70 --> 01:51:11.02
the extreme ownership of the whole thing. A seal buddy of mine came over to my

1879
01:51:11.02 --> 01:51:19.02
house the other day. And he brought 20 copies of extreme ownership. His wife

1880
01:51:19.02 --> 01:51:25.98
wanted to give is giving them to her team in company. And he goes, yeah, you

1881
01:51:25.98 --> 01:51:30.70
know, I'm giving you my wife really want to skip. And she's read it. She loves

1882
01:51:30.70 --> 01:51:36.14
it. And then he goes, but she's kind of a bull in a China shop. Yes. And I was like,

1883
01:51:36.14 --> 01:51:39.50
okay, cool. So guess what I did? I was like, hey, let me give a little

1884
01:51:39.50 --> 01:51:43.10
sum for your wife's Christmas present. Give her a little Christmas present.

1885
01:51:43.10 --> 01:51:46.46
You know, we have a little something called dichotomy leadership. Because that's the

1886
01:51:46.46 --> 01:51:48.94
situation you're talking about. You know what, though, it's like her

1887
01:51:48.94 --> 01:51:52.70
fixed situation. Like you think, I'm going to go take ownership. And it's like,

1888
01:51:52.70 --> 01:51:56.38
well, or even like everyone's going to read this book. It's like, okay,

1889
01:51:56.38 --> 01:51:59.90
let's do a little dichotomy leadership. Let's make sure we're balanced. Yeah,

1890
01:51:59.90 --> 01:52:04.46
actually though, you know what I just thought of right now. I got it. I got to take it back.

1891
01:52:05.10 --> 01:52:09.02
Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm right. Maybe I'm not with that whole analogy. But, you know,

1892
01:52:09.02 --> 01:52:13.90
what, though? What's more important? Power or or or or what he'll act your seal, whatever.

1893
01:52:14.78 --> 01:52:17.42
Right? Because it's kind of the same thing. Extreme ownership is like, oh, here's

1894
01:52:17.42 --> 01:52:21.42
what you do full speed. This is what you do. And then the dichotomy is kind of the control

1895
01:52:21.42 --> 01:52:25.58
element. What's more important? Control or speed? It's the same. Yeah. Control or part.

1896
01:52:25.58 --> 01:52:29.90
Yes, are you a bleak control? They're both important. I think so too. Yeah. At the end of the day,

1897
01:52:29.90 --> 01:52:35.02
that's I think that's the scenario though. Well, you think you won't have, you won't have anything

1898
01:52:35.02 --> 01:52:39.02
to balance if you don't understand the fundamental principles, combat leadership. That's true. Right. So yeah,

1899
01:52:39.02 --> 01:52:45.02
yeah, that's true. And just the way it's got to be. Yeah. And yeah, so get those books. Good

1900
01:52:45.02 --> 01:52:53.34
Christmas presents. So I'm the worst gift giver. Yeah, you're not very good to write. Let me

1901
01:52:53.34 --> 01:52:59.58
let me take it back. If I get you a gift, which is not likely, it'll be great. But it's a slim chance

1902
01:52:59.58 --> 01:53:05.98
you're getting one. Yeah. How many gifts have you gotten from me? Two. What I give you? Well,

1903
01:53:05.98 --> 01:53:11.98
one actually, a tech thing I don't think was from you. You gave me a copy of the discipline

1904
01:53:11.98 --> 01:53:17.66
equals freedom field manual signed like on your own. Like it wasn't like, hey, give me your

1905
01:53:17.66 --> 01:53:23.42
like, hey, you know, yeah, yeah. Yeah. For paper here is free. Okay. That was cool. What else? Nice. It's

1906
01:53:23.42 --> 01:53:28.14
cool because I've written six books. I'm giving you one. Yeah. You're back in about average. Well,

1907
01:53:28.14 --> 01:53:33.10
20% of my time. You gave my daughter one. That's your job. Yeah. Exactly. Right. Now me,

1908
01:53:33.66 --> 01:53:37.18
with different, no, you gave me something. I think it was like a shirt or something. Then I found out

1909
01:53:37.18 --> 01:53:41.66
like later that day that it wasn't for me. It knows from a sound. So you're just a message. Yeah,

1910
01:53:41.66 --> 01:53:45.74
just giving to you. So you know, like, to one gift. Yeah, thanks for that. By the way,

1919
01:54:37.02 --> 01:54:41.66
went to Brisbane, Australia. Yeah. And I did a book signing in Brisbane, Australia. And I announced

1920
01:54:41.66 --> 01:54:47.02
it on like a Wednesday or a Thursday. And that book's anyway on Friday. And I showed up. And there was

1921
01:54:47.02 --> 01:54:53.90
hundreds and hundreds of people there. Yeah. I was super stoked about that. And it's showed that

1922
01:54:53.90 --> 01:54:58.78
there was a lot of people that were supporting. And of course, we got EF Overwatch, which is

01:55:10.46 --> 01:55:15.82
So go to EF Overwatch and fill out the information there. Either as a town and seeker or a career

1926

1929
01:55:38.22 --> 01:55:45.34
we're going to do Q&A live, I think. Or maybe I'll send like questions from the group. Yeah. Like the

1930
01:55:45.34 --> 01:55:49.18
old school. Old school. Old school. And half of that. So that's what we're going to do. Something like

1931
01:55:49.18 --> 01:55:56.78
that. Anyways, calendar yourself. January 9th, New York City. If you're in that area, or you

1934
01:56:11.26 --> 01:56:19.34
Keep on. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Whilling. And thanks to all the military

1935
01:56:19.34 --> 01:56:27.10
personnel out there that are providing us with this way of life. And you can see how bad life can

1936
01:56:27.10 --> 01:56:36.54
get when you read a book like the Gulagakra Pelago. Also, thanks to police and law enforcement

1937
01:56:36.54 --> 01:56:41.66
firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, correctional officers, border patrol, and all first responders

1938
01:56:41.66 --> 01:56:49.02
for protecting this way of life that we have here at home. And to everyone else out there, just

1939
01:56:49.02 --> 01:56:58.46
remember that this nightmare of the Gulags started when people kept quiet on a large scale.

1940
01:56:58.46 --> 01:57:09.18
And on a small scale, don't let that happen on a large scale and don't let it happen to you.

1941
01:57:11.74 --> 01:57:18.78
Resist, that whole opening chapter about now resisting, don't let that happen, resist, resist,

1942
01:57:18.78 --> 01:57:26.46
the weakness, resist the lies, resist the things in your life that will turn you into a prisoner

1943
01:57:26.46 --> 01:57:39.50
and into a slave. And you do that by going out there every day and getting after it.

1944
01:57:39.50 --> 01:57:55.42
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
