00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80
This is Jocco podcast number 44 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:12.08
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:20.72
And the last podcast, number 43, when a little bit long.

4
00:00:20.72 --> 00:00:23.28
Sure, we did not get to the Q&A.

5
00:00:23.28 --> 00:00:29.96
And that's one of the nice things about having a podcast, having a form that we actually own.

6
00:00:29.96 --> 00:00:32.40
And can do whatever we want with.

7
00:00:32.40 --> 00:00:34.04
If it goes long, that's cool.

8
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm going to just let it go along.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We can go down that road.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.40
Now, some people might say, oh, you went too far down that road.

11
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:44.60
Okay, that's fine.

12
00:00:44.60 --> 00:00:45.88
Press stop.

13
00:00:45.88 --> 00:00:47.12
Go proceed.

14
00:00:47.12 --> 00:00:48.12
Somewhere else.

15
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:52.52
Some people say, I wish you would have gone further down that road.

16
00:00:52.52 --> 00:00:56.72
So we're just kind of going off of instinct here.

17
00:00:56.72 --> 00:00:58.76
What to me?

18
00:00:58.76 --> 00:01:01.68
Like, okay, think we went far enough now in that road.

19
00:01:01.68 --> 00:01:03.32
We're good there.

20
00:01:03.32 --> 00:01:06.08
But we did not get to Q&A.

21
00:01:06.08 --> 00:01:10.64
And so that's working to do today.

22
00:01:10.64 --> 00:01:12.08
Do some Q&A.

23
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:16.60
Questions from the interwebs.

24
00:01:16.60 --> 00:01:17.60
This is always good.

25
00:01:17.60 --> 00:01:20.84
A lot of people, tons of questions, definitely appreciate all the questions that are coming

26
00:01:20.84 --> 00:01:22.12
through.

27
00:01:22.12 --> 00:01:23.12
And I apologize.

28
00:01:23.12 --> 00:01:25.84
I can't get to all of them.

29
00:01:25.84 --> 00:01:27.36
I will say this.

30
00:01:27.36 --> 00:01:30.08
I've talked to some troopers out in the field.

31
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:33.48
And they're like, we know what you're going to say.

32
00:01:33.48 --> 00:01:35.88
Like, when a question comes, which is awesome.

33
00:01:35.88 --> 00:01:38.000
That means I'm working myself out of a job.

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.68
If you're out there and you already know what the answer to the question is, that's

35
00:01:40.68 --> 00:01:41.68
awesome.

36
00:01:41.68 --> 00:01:42.68
That means cool.

37
00:01:42.68 --> 00:01:44.76
You figured out, you know what you need to go, educate someone else.

38
00:01:44.76 --> 00:01:46.08
Go help someone else, go.

39
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:53.36
So it's cool that people are starting to understand, I think, the holistic mindset that's

40
00:01:53.36 --> 00:01:54.92
going on here.

41
00:01:54.92 --> 00:01:56.44
And that's very positive to me.

42
00:01:56.44 --> 00:02:01.32
Now that being said, there's always questions that come through.

43
00:02:01.32 --> 00:02:05.24
Sometimes even I'm going, okay, let me think about that one.

44
00:02:05.24 --> 00:02:06.44
And some of them are really obvious.

45
00:02:06.44 --> 00:02:10.76
I got on Twitter the other day.

46
00:02:10.76 --> 00:02:17.36
So let me ask somebody said, hey, what have you learned about people or about humans?

47
00:02:17.36 --> 00:02:23.88
Since you, you know, kind of entered the world of social media on a large scale.

48
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:29.48
And I wrote back that I've figured out that humans don't Google things before they ask you

49
00:02:29.48 --> 00:02:32.44
the question on Twitter.

50
00:02:32.44 --> 00:02:39.000
Because sometimes people just ask me, you know, just a question that you could Google faster,

51
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.60
that asked me about a, you know, just some quote, not one of my quotes, but a Shakespeare

52
00:02:44.60 --> 00:02:52.56
quote or a book or a military unit, you know, man, Google that don't ask me.

53
00:02:52.56 --> 00:02:55.56
If you want to ask me a specific question that I might know, that's cool.

54
00:02:55.56 --> 00:02:56.56
That's awesome.

55
00:02:56.56 --> 00:02:57.88
I'm more than happy to answer it.

56
00:02:57.88 --> 00:03:03.84
Also, I get asked 12 times a day, what time do you go to sleep at night?

57
00:03:03.84 --> 00:03:07.12
So I just write 11.

58
00:03:07.12 --> 00:03:08.88
And people aren't laughing about that.

59
00:03:08.88 --> 00:03:11.80
Anyways, but would you get some awesome questions from the inner web as well?

60
00:03:11.80 --> 00:03:16.88
And the other thing that's cool about answering questions from the interwebs is it does make

61
00:03:16.88 --> 00:03:22.52
me think about that specific situation that someone's in?

62
00:03:22.52 --> 00:03:26.84
And A have I experienced it before, which maybe I have, maybe I haven't.

63
00:03:26.84 --> 00:03:31.04
I've at least probably seen it before or some version of it.

64
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.88
But then once you answer a question about it, it quantifies in your brain.

65
00:03:34.88 --> 00:03:36.68
It solidifies in your brain.

66
00:03:36.68 --> 00:03:42.44
And now when I get asked that question again, I'm like boom, I can answer it more.

67
00:03:42.44 --> 00:03:46.60
I can answer with a little more authority because I've seen it before.

68
00:03:46.60 --> 00:03:48.72
That makes it better.

69
00:03:48.72 --> 00:03:54.40
So basically what I'm saying is when I get forced to answer questions, I am learning.

70
00:03:54.40 --> 00:03:55.76
Just like when I'm reading a book, I'm learning.

71
00:03:55.76 --> 00:03:57.16
When I'm answering a question, I'm learning.

72
00:03:57.16 --> 00:03:58.96
Yeah, just like when you teach it move.

73
00:03:58.96 --> 00:04:01.48
When you teach a moving to Jitsu, you get better at that move.

74
00:04:01.48 --> 00:04:02.96
No doubt about it.

75
00:04:02.96 --> 00:04:05.44
And that's why it is beneficial for me.

76
00:04:05.44 --> 00:04:10.04
And I appreciate all these questions that everybody asked me because they make me smarter.

77
00:04:10.04 --> 00:04:12.16
So, all right, rock and roll.

78
00:04:12.16 --> 00:04:16.48
All right, question number one.

79
00:04:16.48 --> 00:04:18.68
This one was pretty you and Sam Harris.

80
00:04:18.68 --> 00:04:19.68
That's right.

81
00:04:19.68 --> 00:04:26.28
Sam Harris is sitting here by the way, but the question is, I would like to start

82
00:04:26.28 --> 00:04:31.000
BJJ training, but worry about injury.

83
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
What are your thoughts?

84
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.64
Now, I actually, we had these questions prepared for to answer on the tail end of 43.

85
00:04:38.64 --> 00:04:42.36
And I will say this, people want to know what's in my mind set about things.

86
00:04:42.36 --> 00:04:43.36
You know, what am I thinking?

87
00:04:43.36 --> 00:04:44.36
Here's one thing.

88
00:04:44.36 --> 00:04:45.68
You might notice this pattern.

89
00:04:45.68 --> 00:04:49.64
If you pay attention close to attention, the podcast, you might notice there's a pattern

90
00:04:49.64 --> 00:04:58.16
that usually after these crazy dark books, I usually roll that first question in the question

91
00:04:58.16 --> 00:05:00.88
and answer period is about Jitsu.

92
00:05:00.88 --> 00:05:04.52
Like let's just relax a little bit.

93
00:05:04.52 --> 00:05:08.80
Somebody posted somebody, BJJK, man, came and rolled with me.

94
00:05:08.80 --> 00:05:13.92
And someone was telling me, someone that I know was telling me, like, yeah, my friend saw

95
00:05:13.92 --> 00:05:16.32
the picture, the video of you rolling.

96
00:05:16.32 --> 00:05:19.84
And it was like, he looks like the happiest I've ever seen him.

97
00:05:19.84 --> 00:05:22.28
And I was like, yeah, I was on the map.

98
00:05:22.28 --> 00:05:30.48
So that's the general idea between, let's just go from the intensity, generally, of a combat

99
00:05:30.48 --> 00:05:37.36
situation from a book into our, now we can take a wrap off and we can talk about Jitsu.

100
00:05:37.36 --> 00:05:39.36
You know, I like that.

101
00:05:39.36 --> 00:05:40.84
Yeah, make sense.

102
00:05:40.84 --> 00:05:44.88
So BJJ training and your word about interest, that makes sense.

103
00:05:44.88 --> 00:05:47.92
Actually, I got some, I've got to ask this question a few times.

104
00:05:47.92 --> 00:05:51.44
People that rely on their hands to work.

105
00:05:51.44 --> 00:05:54.16
One guy's a professional, actually, two guys were professional guitarists.

106
00:05:54.16 --> 00:05:55.16
Oh, yeah, yeah.

107
00:05:55.16 --> 00:05:58.60
And they're sketched out about Dung Jitsu.

108
00:05:58.60 --> 00:06:04.12
Anybody that has a job that relies on the lot of physicality, you are at risk, because

109
00:06:04.12 --> 00:06:05.92
you're, you know, you're doing a sport.

110
00:06:05.92 --> 00:06:09.64
No, injuries absolutely happen in Jitsu.

111
00:06:09.64 --> 00:06:14.48
It is a contact sport and you can get injured while you're doing it.

112
00:06:14.48 --> 00:06:17.28
You can get injured in any sport that you do.

113
00:06:17.28 --> 00:06:18.28
Yeah.

114
00:06:18.28 --> 00:06:19.56
Any sport that you do.

115
00:06:19.56 --> 00:06:22.36
The worst, my, I hurt my knee.

116
00:06:22.36 --> 00:06:25.12
I had 80% tearing my MCL.

117
00:06:25.12 --> 00:06:26.12
Did it surfing.

118
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:27.12
Yeah.

119
00:06:27.12 --> 00:06:31.48
You know, Ben Heal hooked by Dean Lister of thousands, 1000s and thousands of times, never had

120
00:06:31.48 --> 00:06:32.48
a knee injury.

121
00:06:32.48 --> 00:06:34.60
I'm out surfing and hurt my knee.

122
00:06:34.60 --> 00:06:39.08
So you can get hurt doing anything.

123
00:06:39.08 --> 00:06:43.04
But so you have to be careful, right?

124
00:06:43.04 --> 00:06:47.60
And I think one of the best of one of the most critical ways to be careful in Jitsu is

125
00:06:47.60 --> 00:06:50.32
by make sure that you're picking the right training partners.

126
00:06:50.32 --> 00:06:57.36
Because there's some knucklehead training partners at every gym and you're, they're a 20,

127
00:06:57.36 --> 00:07:06.72
22 year old male who has a lot of testosterone and has a very sensitive ego.

128
00:07:06.72 --> 00:07:09.12
So he's looking just to crush everyone.

129
00:07:09.12 --> 00:07:10.40
So you got to watch out for that guy.

130
00:07:10.40 --> 00:07:16.20
And actually, I shouldn't actually paint that so broad brush because there's plenty of

131
00:07:16.20 --> 00:07:20.48
people that are older people with a big ego and younger people.

132
00:07:20.48 --> 00:07:23.36
There's people that are just basically, you got to watch out for these knuckleheads that

133
00:07:23.36 --> 00:07:24.36
are going to go crazy.

134
00:07:24.36 --> 00:07:25.36
Yeah.

135
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:27.16
Some people don't know better too.

136
00:07:27.16 --> 00:07:30.12
You know, they're just, they just happen to be being in strong and they're not being

137
00:07:30.12 --> 00:07:31.12
knuckles.

138
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:32.12
Sure.

139
00:07:32.12 --> 00:07:33.12
Sure.

140
00:07:33.12 --> 00:07:35.04
They're just like, they're getting, you know, they're telling me to grab the arm and pull.

141
00:07:35.04 --> 00:07:36.04
I'm trying to pass that guard.

142
00:07:36.04 --> 00:07:37.84
I don't know that much technique.

143
00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:38.88
I'm just going to go hard.

144
00:07:38.88 --> 00:07:39.88
Yeah.

145
00:07:39.88 --> 00:07:40.88
No, that's right.

146
00:07:40.88 --> 00:07:44.52
They're, they're not intentionally being aggressive, but Jesus is an aggressive

147
00:07:44.52 --> 00:07:45.52
sport.

148
00:07:45.52 --> 00:07:49.24
And if you happen to be 260 pounds, that can be problematic.

149
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:53.32
So you want to, and I know it sounds weird, because we're going to have to rule some

150
00:07:53.32 --> 00:07:55.92
purple belt that's just going to run through me and actually you do.

151
00:07:55.92 --> 00:07:56.92
Yeah.

152
00:07:56.92 --> 00:08:01.60
The chance of you getting hurt by a purple belt are infinitely less than you getting hurt

153
00:08:01.60 --> 00:08:02.60
by a white belt.

154
00:08:02.60 --> 00:08:03.60
Absolutely true.

155
00:08:03.60 --> 00:08:08.000
Higher you go up the more accurate that is, unless of course you're a, you're a, you're

156
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
a problem.

157
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Right.

158
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Or you're a bully.

159
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.64
And there needs to be a regular, a situation to happen in which case a black belt is not

160
00:08:15.64 --> 00:08:19.48
going to, you know, he won't, he won't interview you, though.

161
00:08:19.48 --> 00:08:20.48
That's the thing.

162
00:08:20.48 --> 00:08:21.48
Sure.

163
00:08:21.48 --> 00:08:26.32
I think when you enter fighting sports, punishment isn't being beat up.

164
00:08:26.32 --> 00:08:27.32
You get beat up.

165
00:08:27.32 --> 00:08:28.32
That's part of the game.

166
00:08:28.32 --> 00:08:29.32
Sure.

167
00:08:29.32 --> 00:08:33.56
It's more, it's more of like an embarrassment thing or like, just like,

168
00:08:33.56 --> 00:08:37.76
always get, yeah, like they're going to wear you out, you know, or make you look like

169
00:08:37.76 --> 00:08:38.76
you soccer.

170
00:08:38.76 --> 00:08:41.88
I don't, it's, it's more of like a lesson thing in that way.

171
00:08:41.88 --> 00:08:42.88
Yeah.

172
00:08:42.88 --> 00:08:44.16
It's not like getting beat up.

173
00:08:44.16 --> 00:08:45.72
I agree with you now.

174
00:08:45.72 --> 00:08:47.20
Another piece of this.

175
00:08:47.20 --> 00:08:49.20
And I, this is just a reality.

176
00:08:49.20 --> 00:08:51.88
Okay.

177
00:08:51.88 --> 00:08:53.56
Doing stand up.

178
00:08:53.56 --> 00:08:55.16
You have a higher chance of getting hurt.

179
00:08:55.16 --> 00:08:59.16
Like doing take downs, going hard take downs, either due to a tight style take downs

180
00:08:59.16 --> 00:09:04.36
or resting style take downs, you have a higher chance of getting a knee injury or an

181
00:09:04.36 --> 00:09:05.36
ankle injury.

182
00:09:05.36 --> 00:09:07.16
There's no doubt about it.

183
00:09:07.16 --> 00:09:09.48
So be careful.

184
00:09:09.48 --> 00:09:14.36
Just think about what you're doing there with, with stand up.

185
00:09:14.36 --> 00:09:17.64
You know, if you're a person that's, you know, you got to get a basic take downs

186
00:09:17.64 --> 00:09:18.64
absolutely.

187
00:09:18.64 --> 00:09:22.84
But do you need to step in there night after night and get your full on wrestling

188
00:09:22.84 --> 00:09:23.84
practice together?

189
00:09:23.84 --> 00:09:28.96
And as, if you're a 43 year old person that, you know, you're a 43 year old cop that's

190
00:09:28.96 --> 00:09:31.36
working to beat, you, you know, you need to know take downs.

191
00:09:31.36 --> 00:09:32.16
Don't get me wrong.

192
00:09:32.16 --> 00:09:32.96
You need to train him.

193
00:09:32.96 --> 00:09:33.96
You need to study.

194
00:09:33.96 --> 00:09:34.96
You need to make sure you're not doing.

195
00:09:34.96 --> 00:09:39.56
Do you need to out wrestle somebody in a wrestling situation?

196
00:09:39.56 --> 00:09:42.56
Probably not, you know, you're, you're not going to need to do that.

197
00:09:42.56 --> 00:09:47.56
So just use caution with take downs.

198
00:09:47.56 --> 00:09:48.76
Make sure you know how to do them.

199
00:09:48.76 --> 00:09:55.76
But as you get to where you want to not get injured is your point of your primary

200
00:09:55.76 --> 00:09:58.76
training.

201
00:09:58.76 --> 00:10:01.36
Then just be careful to stand up.

202
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:02.56
Obviously do a good warm up.

203
00:10:02.56 --> 00:10:10.24
And this is something I'm just the worst perpetrator of not warming up well.

204
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:12.68
I like to warm up by rolling.

205
00:10:12.68 --> 00:10:17.52
So it actually now I do usually do one round where I'm just kind of chilling and just kind

206
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:18.92
of rolling flow.

207
00:10:18.92 --> 00:10:19.92
But I used to not even do that.

208
00:10:19.92 --> 00:10:21.92
He's just a clap hands and go.

209
00:10:21.92 --> 00:10:22.92
So don't do that.

210
00:10:22.92 --> 00:10:24.52
Obviously keep your ego in check.

211
00:10:24.52 --> 00:10:25.52
And I'll tell you another thing.

212
00:10:25.52 --> 00:10:28.80
And I was talking about this with Greg Train the other day because Greg Train popped

213
00:10:28.80 --> 00:10:29.80
as a rib.

214
00:10:29.80 --> 00:10:30.80
Yeah.

215
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:33.88
And he was just saying to me, he's rib is recovered now.

216
00:10:33.88 --> 00:10:38.80
But he was saying to me, you know, he's like, I think you don't get injured because

217
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:39.80
you work out all the time.

218
00:10:39.80 --> 00:10:42.12
And I'm like, I agree with you 100%.

219
00:10:42.12 --> 00:10:46.28
So I believe that you should work out on a regular basis.

220
00:10:46.28 --> 00:10:50.56
And I said, somebody just asked me, do you train and lift on the same days?

221
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:55.72
That has, yeah, absolutely.

222
00:10:55.72 --> 00:10:55.84
I train and lift every day.

223
00:10:55.84 --> 00:10:58.32
So get your workout program going on.

224
00:10:58.32 --> 00:11:00.16
You know, make sure you maintain that.

225
00:11:00.16 --> 00:11:06.08
Some people when they start doing GJ2, they're going so crazy that they use all this muscle.

226
00:11:06.08 --> 00:11:08.76
And so they go, I'm not going to work out because I'm just getting a workout.

227
00:11:08.76 --> 00:11:10.08
No, wrong answer.

228
00:11:10.08 --> 00:11:11.08
Keep working out.

229
00:11:11.08 --> 00:11:12.56
And matter of fact, you should.

230
00:11:12.56 --> 00:11:17.40
And I always encourage working out lifting, doing your metcon, doing whatever before

231
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:19.000
you do GJ2.

232
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That's what I do.

233
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.84
I want to be tired when I show up to GJ2 and fight in a worse scenario, you know, make

234
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:25.52
it harder for myself.

235
00:11:25.52 --> 00:11:29.40
I don't want to show up and be all fresh.

236
00:11:29.40 --> 00:11:31.04
And like, that's going to happen every day.

237
00:11:31.04 --> 00:11:33.32
No, I like to be tired.

238
00:11:33.32 --> 00:11:39.000
Worn out, stressed system and then show up and still get after it on the mats.

239
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.24
Yeah, that part's pretty advanced though to do it like that.

240
00:11:42.24 --> 00:11:46.24
Got to say, I mean, being new is the question, I've done that the whole time.

241
00:11:46.24 --> 00:11:47.24
Yeah.

242
00:11:47.24 --> 00:11:50.000
And I've done that two before and good.

243
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Yeah.

244
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.68
Do you work out after?

245
00:11:52.68 --> 00:11:54.48
You lift weights after you train GJ2?

246
00:11:54.48 --> 00:11:55.48
I've done both.

247
00:11:55.48 --> 00:11:56.48
Okay.

248
00:11:56.48 --> 00:11:57.48
What do you do normally?

249
00:11:57.48 --> 00:12:00.52
I do one and like, I don't do two days normally.

250
00:12:00.52 --> 00:12:04.76
Oh, so when you roll into the mat, you're like, oh, fresh.

251
00:12:04.76 --> 00:12:07.96
In a matter of speaking, yeah, fresher than I would be if I did a workout before.

252
00:12:07.96 --> 00:12:08.96
Yes.

253
00:12:08.96 --> 00:12:09.96
Put it that way.

254
00:12:09.96 --> 00:12:10.96
That's cool.

255
00:12:10.96 --> 00:12:11.96
No, that's right.

256
00:12:11.96 --> 00:12:12.96
No, that is how it is.

257
00:12:12.96 --> 00:12:13.96
Yes, for sure.

258
00:12:13.96 --> 00:12:16.92
But before and even when I was training for competition and stuff, oh, yeah.

259
00:12:16.92 --> 00:12:21.16
And even, yeah, like maybe like two years, three years ago, maybe?

260
00:12:21.16 --> 00:12:25.08
Yeah, I do the workout first.

261
00:12:25.08 --> 00:12:26.76
And then go roll up like in the evening.

262
00:12:26.76 --> 00:12:29.64
I think that's the plan.

263
00:12:29.64 --> 00:12:32.28
As much as you can work on your flexibility.

264
00:12:32.28 --> 00:12:35.44
And this is something that I again, this is a big failure in my book.

265
00:12:35.44 --> 00:12:38.60
I'm not flexible as I should be.

266
00:12:38.60 --> 00:12:42.64
And if you are more flexible, your injury levels are going to go down.

267
00:12:42.64 --> 00:12:49.64
So stretch and it's really easy stuff that everyone says to do when you're sitting there

268
00:12:49.64 --> 00:12:52.36
on the mat, even when you're sitting in the mat and the teacher's teaching, you know,

269
00:12:52.36 --> 00:12:56.92
trying to go to a lotus position, trying to do stretcher while you're sitting around,

270
00:12:56.92 --> 00:12:59.60
just stretch while you're sitting around, while you're working on your computer sitting

271
00:12:59.60 --> 00:13:01.44
away that you're getting some kind of stretch.

272
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:03.52
So stretch and be flexible as much as you can.

273
00:13:03.52 --> 00:13:07.64
Now another thing I kind of talked about guitarists and anybody, you know, a surgeon,

274
00:13:07.64 --> 00:13:12.000
anybody that's working with their hands and wants to protect their fingers.

275
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.96
I would recommend maybe emphasizing more nogy where you're not grabbing on to that

276
00:13:17.96 --> 00:13:18.96
ghee all the time.

277
00:13:18.96 --> 00:13:19.96
Yeah.

278
00:13:19.96 --> 00:13:20.96
Yeah.

279
00:13:20.96 --> 00:13:23.96
And fingers get caught up in there and it twists or something to it.

280
00:13:23.96 --> 00:13:24.96
Yeah.

281
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:25.96
It's an Yankel.

282
00:13:25.96 --> 00:13:26.96
It's an Yankel.

283
00:13:26.96 --> 00:13:27.96
Yeah.

284
00:13:27.96 --> 00:13:28.96
Every time, pretty much.

285
00:13:28.96 --> 00:13:29.96
It's fairly common.

286
00:13:29.96 --> 00:13:32.44
I actually, my worst finger injury was actually no ghee.

287
00:13:32.44 --> 00:13:36.64
So that's, and I only did a couple months ago, which is just, and it was just a bizarre,

288
00:13:36.64 --> 00:13:37.64
you know, it was a bizarre incident.

289
00:13:37.64 --> 00:13:39.64
I was one of those things.

290
00:13:39.64 --> 00:13:47.36
That's why it's really hard for me to just straight up and curve somebody that needs

291
00:13:47.36 --> 00:13:48.36
their fingers.

292
00:13:48.36 --> 00:13:49.36
Yeah.

293
00:13:49.36 --> 00:13:50.36
No, no, don't worry.

294
00:13:50.36 --> 00:13:51.72
You're not going to get no, no, you can't get it.

295
00:13:51.72 --> 00:13:58.76
Now, I've had one finger injury, you know, significant finger injury in 20 plus years.

296
00:13:58.76 --> 00:14:04.20
So you can get a finger injury cut in the carrots on the, you know, in the kitchen.

297
00:14:04.20 --> 00:14:10.56
So, you know, you got to be careful, but there's no guarantee that you're not going

298
00:14:10.56 --> 00:14:11.56
to hurt.

299
00:14:11.56 --> 00:14:13.88
And I'll tell you, and the other thing is, I'll say this.

300
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:15.92
You got some chance of getting injured, right?

301
00:14:15.92 --> 00:14:23.36
But there's also some massive, physical and mental benefits that will likely outweigh

302
00:14:23.36 --> 00:14:26.96
the injuries, the perceived injuries or the possible injuries that you might get.

303
00:14:26.96 --> 00:14:28.72
So you're just going to be healthier.

304
00:14:28.72 --> 00:14:30.36
Your fingers are going to be stronger.

305
00:14:30.36 --> 00:14:33.52
I mean, yeah, you might get some injured fingers.

306
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:36.12
But you are also going to have fingers that are stronger.

307
00:14:36.12 --> 00:14:38.28
Your grip is going to be stronger.

308
00:14:38.28 --> 00:14:39.68
So that's beneficial.

309
00:14:39.68 --> 00:14:40.68
Your mind is going to be stronger.

310
00:14:40.68 --> 00:14:41.96
Your cardiovascular system is going to be stronger.

311
00:14:41.96 --> 00:14:49.24
So there's a lot of benefits to jujitsu that outweigh in my mind the possibility of having

312
00:14:49.24 --> 00:14:50.24
an injury.

313
00:14:50.24 --> 00:14:51.24
Yeah.

314
00:14:51.24 --> 00:14:56.44
I mean, a possibility of having a catastrophic injury is pretty small, especially if you train

315
00:14:56.44 --> 00:14:57.44
smart.

316
00:14:57.44 --> 00:14:58.44
It really is.

317
00:14:58.44 --> 00:14:59.44
Okay.

318
00:14:59.44 --> 00:15:00.44
Absolutely, you're.

319
00:15:00.44 --> 00:15:01.44
Yes.

320
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:06.08
Even of the people that you know over 20, that's a lot of people that you know,

321
00:15:06.08 --> 00:15:08.04
who's had any kind of major injury?

322
00:15:08.04 --> 00:15:11.96
Well, if you count, it turns to jujitsu major injury.

323
00:15:11.96 --> 00:15:15.64
But, you know, if you bought your knee, that means you're going to be down.

324
00:15:15.64 --> 00:15:17.68
You're going to be six months of surgery or whatever.

325
00:15:17.68 --> 00:15:20.72
Surgery and six months of rehab and then another three months before you can train.

326
00:15:20.72 --> 00:15:22.52
That's, you know, that's a year.

327
00:15:22.52 --> 00:15:23.52
Yeah.

328
00:15:23.52 --> 00:15:26.32
And that could be some people considered that catastrophic injury.

329
00:15:26.32 --> 00:15:28.52
I know I would be devastated.

330
00:15:28.52 --> 00:15:31.04
But at the same time, you know, I got next surgery.

331
00:15:31.04 --> 00:15:32.04
I was out for a bit.

332
00:15:32.04 --> 00:15:33.40
Don't even remember it now.

333
00:15:33.40 --> 00:15:34.40
Flash in the pan who cares.

334
00:15:34.40 --> 00:15:35.40
Whatever.

335
00:15:35.40 --> 00:15:36.40
Deal with it.

336
00:15:36.40 --> 00:15:37.40
I played Margitar during that time.

337
00:15:37.40 --> 00:15:38.40
You know what I mean?

338
00:15:38.40 --> 00:15:39.40
Good times.

339
00:15:39.40 --> 00:15:40.40
Yeah.

340
00:15:40.40 --> 00:15:44.68
And in reference to this question, man, this is anything you do.

341
00:15:44.68 --> 00:15:46.40
Guys on the basketball court all the time.

342
00:15:46.40 --> 00:15:48.80
Oh, I'll go up for this recreational basketball.

343
00:15:48.80 --> 00:15:50.20
Pick up game weekend, whatever.

344
00:15:50.20 --> 00:15:51.56
Blot any ankle, whatever.

345
00:15:51.56 --> 00:15:55.36
You know, I had, I mean, I've been in the game what 12 years.

346
00:15:55.36 --> 00:16:00.28
I had won because I was getting nuts in a tournament, bicep, tear, major injury.

347
00:16:00.28 --> 00:16:03.16
You know, out for, you know, year or whatever.

348
00:16:03.16 --> 00:16:07.32
But other than that, never been injured because of the submission.

349
00:16:07.32 --> 00:16:08.64
Not a training, too.

350
00:16:08.64 --> 00:16:09.64
Yeah.

351
00:16:09.64 --> 00:16:12.76
And full speed training, competition, like everything.

352
00:16:12.76 --> 00:16:14.68
It's for a submission holds go.

353
00:16:14.68 --> 00:16:16.64
Never been injured in a submission.

354
00:16:16.64 --> 00:16:17.64
You know how like I don't have to tell you.

355
00:16:17.64 --> 00:16:18.64
Yeah, after time or another.

356
00:16:18.64 --> 00:16:22.04
You should definitely, if you're a smart, you just declare you'll never get injured

357
00:16:22.04 --> 00:16:24.36
from somebody trying a submission on you because you tap.

358
00:16:24.36 --> 00:16:25.36
Yeah.

359
00:16:25.36 --> 00:16:27.04
You tap and look, it's not going to not hurt.

360
00:16:27.04 --> 00:16:30.16
You know, if you tap too late, usually it's just you get hurt.

361
00:16:30.16 --> 00:16:34.40
Maybe your shoulders kind of whatever for a week or you can still train.

362
00:16:34.40 --> 00:16:35.40
It's not an injury.

363
00:16:35.40 --> 00:16:36.40
Put it that way.

364
00:16:36.40 --> 00:16:37.40
Yeah.

365
00:16:37.40 --> 00:16:41.68
And even if, yeah, even if you're, your big smile, I think that's pretty common.

366
00:16:41.68 --> 00:16:45.64
It's really rare that I see, oh, I might ACL is out because of a heel hook.

367
00:16:45.64 --> 00:16:47.92
Maybe in competition because you're trying to win.

368
00:16:47.92 --> 00:16:48.92
You weren't trying to tap.

369
00:16:48.92 --> 00:16:50.20
There's a few, okay.

370
00:16:50.20 --> 00:16:56.04
But yeah, generally speaking, it's surprising almost that it's that safe.

371
00:16:56.04 --> 00:16:57.04
It is.

372
00:16:57.04 --> 00:17:00.32
That's what you can see when you consider what the objective of the sport is to break

373
00:17:00.32 --> 00:17:02.72
and destroy people's limbs.

374
00:17:02.72 --> 00:17:07.44
The fact that it rarely happens, it just rarely happens.

375
00:17:07.44 --> 00:17:09.60
So yes, be careful.

376
00:17:09.60 --> 00:17:13.76
There's no guarantees, but train.

377
00:17:13.76 --> 00:17:18.48
Back to the training partners part, you know, when you, the first, where you're saying,

378
00:17:18.48 --> 00:17:20.64
be careful with you, train with and stuff like that.

379
00:17:20.64 --> 00:17:26.44
So sometimes, especially like, let's say, if you're older or even if you're a girl

380
00:17:26.44 --> 00:17:32.20
and you go in and you're the only girl and some people, like, let's say the guy doesn't

381
00:17:32.20 --> 00:17:33.20
know any better.

382
00:17:33.20 --> 00:17:34.20
He's going hard.

383
00:17:34.20 --> 00:17:38.68
You can tell when he starts to go hard, sometimes it can be awkward to say, hey,

384
00:17:38.68 --> 00:17:43.08
respectfully, I'm not going to roll with you because it's asking someone to dance and

385
00:17:43.08 --> 00:17:44.08
I'm saying no.

386
00:17:44.08 --> 00:17:46.68
It's like rejection, so it's awkward.

387
00:17:46.68 --> 00:17:50.88
So sometimes people will just tough it out and be like, oh, just try to endure.

388
00:17:50.88 --> 00:17:56.28
I think if you can, if you can go through that and really look out for yourself, where

389
00:17:56.28 --> 00:18:01.16
you know, the guy's going nuts, it's obviously, usually he's not trying to go nuts in

390
00:18:01.16 --> 00:18:02.16
her.

391
00:18:02.16 --> 00:18:04.04
That's pretty rare.

392
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:05.04
But they don't know any better.

393
00:18:05.04 --> 00:18:06.84
They're a white belt or whatever.

394
00:18:06.84 --> 00:18:09.28
And they're just bigger and stronger, whatever.

395
00:18:09.28 --> 00:18:10.44
And they're going nuts.

396
00:18:10.44 --> 00:18:15.56
You've got to find a good, tactful way to be like, hey, I respect you.

397
00:18:15.56 --> 00:18:19.04
But I'm concerned about just my injuries.

398
00:18:19.04 --> 00:18:23.32
Yeah, just, you know, what, hey, sorry, I only roll with people under 130 because I have

399
00:18:23.32 --> 00:18:25.96
a, you know, injured rib.

400
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:27.32
Yeah, and there you go.

401
00:18:27.32 --> 00:18:29.56
Just, just, is that a white lie?

402
00:18:29.56 --> 00:18:30.56
Maybe it is.

403
00:18:30.56 --> 00:18:33.92
But I don't think it's a malicious, why don't you just say, why don't you just say, when

404
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:34.92
you break?

405
00:18:34.92 --> 00:18:38.92
Sam Harris, I apologize for telling people, you tell a little white lie to save themselves

406
00:18:38.92 --> 00:18:41.08
massive injuries, catastrophic injuries.

407
00:18:41.08 --> 00:18:42.08
Yeah.

408
00:18:42.08 --> 00:18:45.80
But again, it's like telling someone, no one they asked you to dance.

409
00:18:45.80 --> 00:18:47.20
You can tell white lies.

410
00:18:47.20 --> 00:18:50.96
The fact is, you know, meant for my own reasons, I don't want to dance.

411
00:18:50.96 --> 00:18:51.96
Yeah.

412
00:18:51.96 --> 00:18:55.48
Yeah, but it might be okay to say, oh, sorry.

413
00:18:55.48 --> 00:18:59.04
I'm here with Billy over there, and so I can't dance with you.

414
00:18:59.04 --> 00:19:01.32
And that's actually going to make you feel better than just say, hey, you know what?

415
00:19:01.32 --> 00:19:02.48
Actually, I don't like you.

416
00:19:02.48 --> 00:19:03.48
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:19:03.48 --> 00:19:04.48
You kind of discussed me.

418
00:19:04.48 --> 00:19:05.48
Yeah.

419
00:19:05.48 --> 00:19:06.48
So I'm not dancing with you walk away.

420
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:07.48
Right.

421
00:19:07.48 --> 00:19:08.48
Yeah, exactly.

422
00:19:08.48 --> 00:19:09.48
Is it necessary to do that?

423
00:19:09.48 --> 00:19:10.48
Probably not.

424
00:19:10.48 --> 00:19:11.48
Maybe the little white lie is okay.

425
00:19:11.48 --> 00:19:12.48
Yeah.

426
00:19:12.48 --> 00:19:13.48
Again, Sam Harris, apologize.

427
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:14.48
We're encouraging line.

428
00:19:14.48 --> 00:19:15.48
Yeah.

429
00:19:15.48 --> 00:19:22.08
It's like, like, I'm not going to say, your spas, your liability.

430
00:19:22.08 --> 00:19:25.36
You might hurt me because of what you don't know how to do.

431
00:19:25.36 --> 00:19:26.36
I'm not going to roll with you.

432
00:19:26.36 --> 00:19:27.36
That's different.

433
00:19:27.36 --> 00:19:29.08
You mean, you can be offended, guys.

434
00:19:29.08 --> 00:19:30.08
Yeah.

435
00:19:30.08 --> 00:19:31.08
Most likely.

436
00:19:31.08 --> 00:19:36.88
So actually, we're actually talking about that while you are on the Jiu-Jitsu mats,

437
00:19:36.88 --> 00:19:37.88
doing physical Jiu-Jitsu.

438
00:19:37.88 --> 00:19:42.48
Sometimes you got a throw in a little mental Jiu-Jitsu in a situation in just manipulate

439
00:19:42.48 --> 00:19:45.08
a little bit the mentality of your training partners.

440
00:19:45.08 --> 00:19:46.08
Yep.

441
00:19:46.08 --> 00:19:48.84
And that is in the spirit of safety indeed.

442
00:19:48.84 --> 00:19:52.04
Because I don't think Jiu-Jitsu would ever say that to anybody.

443
00:19:52.04 --> 00:19:54.72
You can be like, oh, you're a spas boring at all.

444
00:19:54.72 --> 00:19:55.72
If I'm not mistaken.

445
00:19:55.72 --> 00:19:58.40
You've got to deal with them, people.

446
00:19:58.40 --> 00:19:59.40
No.

447
00:19:59.40 --> 00:20:01.24
Next question.

448
00:20:01.24 --> 00:20:03.40
When dealing with new groups of folks.

449
00:20:03.40 --> 00:20:07.64
Hey, Bob, before you go there, by the way, sometimes you should train with someone that's

450
00:20:07.64 --> 00:20:10.48
really the spas and harder and bigger than you.

451
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:11.96
You should do that sometimes.

452
00:20:11.96 --> 00:20:14.68
Now you should use caution when you do it.

453
00:20:14.68 --> 00:20:15.68
Maybe you can get that.

454
00:20:15.68 --> 00:20:18.72
I would rather if my son, if I'm going to have

455
00:20:18.72 --> 00:20:20.60
a train with someone that's big and strong, I'm having a train with you.

456
00:20:20.60 --> 00:20:22.04
I'm having a train with Dean.

457
00:20:22.04 --> 00:20:23.04
Yeah.

458
00:20:23.04 --> 00:20:26.48
Because I know that you guys will give them enough strength to, you know, but you're not

459
00:20:26.48 --> 00:20:29.48
going to hurt him because he's only 140 pounds.

460
00:20:29.48 --> 00:20:31.76
But I don't want to give them pressure here.

461
00:20:31.76 --> 00:20:33.28
Like, sometimes you've got to roll with that.

462
00:20:33.28 --> 00:20:35.88
Sometimes you've got to roll with somebody that's big strong and doesn't know what they're

463
00:20:35.88 --> 00:20:36.88
doing.

464
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:38.48
Just so you're, now you and I know what to do there.

465
00:20:38.48 --> 00:20:47.56
But if you're a blue belt or a blue belt and a big wrestler show in UA, 165 pounds

466
00:20:47.56 --> 00:20:52.84
and a wrestler shows up that way is 240 and it's his third day.

467
00:20:52.84 --> 00:20:57.64
And you're a young guy, you know, it's a good idea to roll with that person.

468
00:20:57.64 --> 00:20:59.24
Because they're going to do things you aren't expecting.

469
00:20:59.24 --> 00:21:00.24
They're really strong.

470
00:21:00.24 --> 00:21:04.64
We try and really hard and you want to be, you want to be, you want to train for yourself

471
00:21:04.64 --> 00:21:05.80
for the unexpected.

472
00:21:05.80 --> 00:21:11.48
So basically, don't just, I'm not saying, we, when I say, you know, watch your training

473
00:21:11.48 --> 00:21:16.76
partners, I'm not saying for a normal person that's training, crawling to a safety bubble

474
00:21:16.76 --> 00:21:17.76
while you're on the mats.

475
00:21:17.76 --> 00:21:21.32
No, especially people that are, you know, young and fit, you should be training with

476
00:21:21.32 --> 00:21:23.28
every person you can.

477
00:21:23.28 --> 00:21:27.52
Every different body style, try them out, big wrestlers, small people, lengthy people,

478
00:21:27.52 --> 00:21:28.52
training with them all.

479
00:21:28.52 --> 00:21:31.08
Because that gets you used to all those different body styles that improves your game.

480
00:21:31.08 --> 00:21:32.08
Yeah.

481
00:21:32.08 --> 00:21:36.20
I'm saying if you are very concerned about injuries, because you have a job that requires

482
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:40.92
you to, you know, use your hands or walk or whatever, then you go, okay, you know what,

483
00:21:40.92 --> 00:21:45.64
I need to take the long, the long vision here, the long fight, the long war, and really

484
00:21:45.64 --> 00:21:47.16
be selective on my training partners.

485
00:21:47.16 --> 00:21:48.16
Absolutely correct.

486
00:21:48.16 --> 00:21:54.64
Yes, just like, I mean, just like, I have a question is, I want to start, you get to,

487
00:21:54.64 --> 00:21:56.12
and I'm worried about it.

488
00:21:56.12 --> 00:21:58.88
So exactly, that guy, you should be using this.

489
00:21:58.88 --> 00:21:59.88
Yeah, exactly.

490
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:02.60
But just like how you say, when you get to about Blue Belt, you got to start introducing

491
00:22:02.60 --> 00:22:08.04
more challenges in different ways and absolutely correct, man, because if you don't, if

492
00:22:08.04 --> 00:22:12.08
you don't, and you can, let's say you're not used to, let's say you used to the same training

493
00:22:12.08 --> 00:22:17.24
partners all the time, and you train with, you know, Blue Belt for a belt.

494
00:22:17.24 --> 00:22:21.32
There is specific and very effective, you get to move for other due to moves, right?

495
00:22:21.32 --> 00:22:22.84
So it's like, don't turn your back.

496
00:22:22.84 --> 00:22:28.32
All these rules that are pretty fundamental that rarely should be broken, and we all know

497
00:22:28.32 --> 00:22:29.32
them.

498
00:22:29.32 --> 00:22:32.04
So you roll with a guy who's it's third day is athletic wrestler.

499
00:22:32.04 --> 00:22:35.56
He doesn't know those rules, but now so he puts you outside of the whole format of

500
00:22:35.56 --> 00:22:38.64
you, and if you don't know it, it's like dang, it's almost him.

501
00:22:38.64 --> 00:22:40.40
I do, you're not really working that good.

502
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:44.20
So if you're not used to it, but if you are used to it, you be like, okay, and that's

503
00:22:44.20 --> 00:22:47.04
such a good technique to use with people, right?

504
00:22:47.04 --> 00:22:51.24
When you're dealing with people, people like people's personalities, people have a personality

505
00:22:51.24 --> 00:22:54.84
that they, that's how they deal with things, and they get people they funnel people into

506
00:22:54.84 --> 00:22:55.84
their world.

507
00:22:55.84 --> 00:23:00.68
So if you have to break that, just step outside their world, like don't get drawn into

508
00:23:00.68 --> 00:23:01.84
people's worlds, right?

509
00:23:01.84 --> 00:23:03.28
Don't get drawn into people's strengths.

510
00:23:03.28 --> 00:23:05.40
I mean, we talked about this all the time, but don't get drawn into their strengths.

511
00:23:05.40 --> 00:23:09.72
Don't get drawn into their way of fighting, because it's not, you're not going to be able

512
00:23:09.72 --> 00:23:12.32
to win that battle, because you do it all day long, right?

513
00:23:12.32 --> 00:23:16.40
So just come out from a different angle, usually disarm new somehow, instead of being

514
00:23:16.40 --> 00:23:19.32
confrontation, oh, wait, this is just normal stuff, but instead of being confrontation

515
00:23:19.32 --> 00:23:25.08
with somebody, take a little flank and maybe massage your ego, but that's the exact same

516
00:23:25.08 --> 00:23:26.08
thing.

517
00:23:26.08 --> 00:23:31.20
If people have a way of doing things and you can get outside their pattern, you have a better

518
00:23:31.20 --> 00:23:32.20
chance of getting a victory.

519
00:23:32.20 --> 00:23:35.84
Yeah, that's crazy on that work.

520
00:23:35.84 --> 00:23:37.16
All right.

521
00:23:37.16 --> 00:23:43.000
So dealing with new groups of folks, when do you do decentralized command right away or

522
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.40
gradually as in slowly give them trust or slowly take it away as needed?

523
00:23:50.40 --> 00:23:52.72
Again, this is a good solid question.

524
00:23:52.72 --> 00:23:57.000
This is something that people ask on a fairly regular basis, and it's a pretty straightforward

525
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
answer.

526
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.20
Okay, you can't obviously just write away, just give people full autonomy, because you have

527
00:24:04.20 --> 00:24:12.56
to build it up somewhat incrementally, give them the opportunity to be on their own now,

528
00:24:12.56 --> 00:24:17.24
and what you're really building, what you're really building with decentralized command

529
00:24:17.24 --> 00:24:19.64
is your building trust.

530
00:24:19.64 --> 00:24:21.64
And that's what you're trying to do.

531
00:24:21.64 --> 00:24:28.64
And as I've said before, the best way to build trust is to give trust.

532
00:24:28.64 --> 00:24:31.92
But before you give trust, you've got to set expectations, you've got to set standards,

533
00:24:31.92 --> 00:24:33.88
you've got to set guidelines, because this person that you're just, and this is a

534
00:24:33.88 --> 00:24:39.92
new person, they might be a crazy, they might be incompetent, they might have a totally

535
00:24:39.92 --> 00:24:42.72
different vision of what's okay than you might be on ethical.

536
00:24:42.72 --> 00:24:47.88
There's all kinds of things that they might be that you can't allow for.

537
00:24:47.88 --> 00:24:55.60
So what you have to do is set those standards, set those guidelines, and put those guard

538
00:24:55.60 --> 00:25:00.12
rails in place so that you make sure that this person is ethical, make sure that they

539
00:25:00.12 --> 00:25:04.96
do are professional, make sure that they do have the same standards, make sure that they

540
00:25:04.96 --> 00:25:07.12
understand the expectations you set for them.

541
00:25:07.12 --> 00:25:15.68
And that's when you can start to hand out more slack and more ownership, because we don't

542
00:25:15.68 --> 00:25:16.68
know micromanage.

543
00:25:16.68 --> 00:25:18.52
When I start to talk about parameters, I'm not talking about telling people exactly how

544
00:25:18.52 --> 00:25:19.52
to do it.

545
00:25:19.52 --> 00:25:24.56
But let's say you and I start to work together, and you are my subordinate.

546
00:25:24.56 --> 00:25:28.20
If we fast forward two years from now, I'd be like, hey, echo, this is what we're trying

547
00:25:28.20 --> 00:25:30.20
to get done, make it happen.

548
00:25:30.20 --> 00:25:33.48
I'll check back with me when it's done.

549
00:25:33.48 --> 00:25:34.48
That's how much leeway I'm giving you.

550
00:25:34.48 --> 00:25:35.48
I'm doing care.

551
00:25:35.48 --> 00:25:39.92
But when we first start working together, I mean, hey, echo, here's what we want to get done.

552
00:25:39.92 --> 00:25:42.80
Can you come up with a plan, and then let me know, let me take a look at what you're going

553
00:25:42.80 --> 00:25:43.80
to do.

554
00:25:43.80 --> 00:25:44.80
Boom.

555
00:25:44.80 --> 00:25:47.68
Now I'm still letting you fully own the plan, but I'm going to do a little check.

556
00:25:47.68 --> 00:25:48.80
I'm going to make sure that it's the right gym.

557
00:25:48.80 --> 00:25:49.80
I'm going to make sure it's a good plan.

558
00:25:49.80 --> 00:25:50.80
I'm going to make sure it's a smart plan.

559
00:25:50.80 --> 00:25:53.60
I'm going to make sure handles our resources correctly.

560
00:25:53.60 --> 00:25:57.000
So all the things, I'm just going to, and then the more we work together, the more we build

561
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.32
the trust, the more you understand the expectations, the less guidance I'm going to give

562
00:26:01.32 --> 00:26:05.76
you, the less oversight I'm going to give you, because I'm going to get built up, because

563
00:26:05.76 --> 00:26:09.16
you've built up trust with me, and I've built up trust with you.

564
00:26:09.16 --> 00:26:11.68
So that's important.

565
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:17.84
I also want you to be able to make your own decisions, because I don't want to be making

566
00:26:17.84 --> 00:26:18.84
decisions all the time.

567
00:26:18.84 --> 00:26:23.96
So even when you, even in the first scenario, when I've been working for a long time,

568
00:26:23.96 --> 00:26:27.12
you know I say, hey, I can go and figure this out, you go you go handle it, you get it done.

569
00:26:27.12 --> 00:26:29.68
When we first start working together, you might come to me and say, hey, Jockel, I hit

570
00:26:29.68 --> 00:26:32.88
this wall, what do you want me to do here?

571
00:26:32.88 --> 00:26:34.88
What do you think I'm going to say?

572
00:26:34.88 --> 00:26:36.76
Figure it out, I'm going to say figure it out.

573
00:26:36.76 --> 00:26:40.96
I'm going to say, hey, man, I don't know what your, what your best guess, or how would you do

574
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:41.96
it?

575
00:26:41.96 --> 00:26:44.92
Or, you know, if we knew each other a little bit better, I'd say, hey, man, don't come

576
00:26:44.92 --> 00:26:47.48
asking me those questions, go figure that out, okay, how you do it?

577
00:26:47.48 --> 00:26:49.36
Just get around that wall, boom.

578
00:26:49.36 --> 00:26:57.76
And we're done. And now the, the other, one other key part of this is often times if

579
00:26:57.76 --> 00:27:06.000
you take over new team, you may want to, you may want to start off by setting the example,

580
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.72
by running the perfect operation, by going from end to end with some project that you set

581
00:27:11.72 --> 00:27:14.04
the standard on how you want things to be.

582
00:27:14.04 --> 00:27:17.52
So every looks and goes, okay, that's how, okay, I see how he did that.

583
00:27:17.52 --> 00:27:20.88
Whoa, he wants that done. He, oh, he holds the line on that.

584
00:27:20.88 --> 00:27:25.12
So that way, everybody knows what the standard is.

585
00:27:25.12 --> 00:27:29.76
So there's, and I would always, you know, I mean, I would always, when I start off,

586
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:33.96
when I take over a普通, take over squad, like, okay, we're doing this operation cool.

587
00:27:33.96 --> 00:27:35.28
Here's how I would run it.

588
00:27:35.28 --> 00:27:37.76
Very distinctly, very clearly be the guy.

589
00:27:37.76 --> 00:27:38.92
Mm-hm.

590
00:27:38.92 --> 00:27:43.92
And then as time goes on and trust develops, I'm going to become less and less the guy

591
00:27:43.92 --> 00:27:50.88
and more and more the, the decentralized leader that's stepping back and letting the front line

592
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:52.48
true, that's what I'm going to try and make happen.

593
00:27:52.48 --> 00:27:59.92
Um, as always, when you do start with a new group, it's really easy.

594
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:06.92
Be humble, listen, take advice, ask questions, ask questions, ask good questions about things

595
00:28:06.92 --> 00:28:08.000
that you have, there's something you don't understand.

596
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.88
I asked a question, no big deal.

597
00:28:09.88 --> 00:28:13.36
Make the slow incremental changes, like hack where talks about, you know,

598
00:28:13.36 --> 00:28:16.72
you're going to feel my soldiers, it's good to change two things a day.

599
00:28:16.72 --> 00:28:17.92
Not going to change the whole world overnight.

600
00:28:17.92 --> 00:28:19.12
Can't do it.

601
00:28:19.12 --> 00:28:21.52
So he's going to change two things a day.

602
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:25.80
That being said, he also did some major, remember, if you remember this hack worth, he

603
00:28:25.80 --> 00:28:28.92
gets in there and the guys have radios and they got good guitars and they got all this stuff

604
00:28:28.92 --> 00:28:31.12
and he goes, yeah, put all that stuff in the middle of the compound.

605
00:28:31.12 --> 00:28:32.84
It's out of here tomorrow.

606
00:28:32.84 --> 00:28:33.84
Right?

607
00:28:33.84 --> 00:28:34.84
That was a major change.

608
00:28:34.84 --> 00:28:38.44
So he went and kind of shook him up a little bit, but then he goes, okay, now I got to go

609
00:28:38.44 --> 00:28:40.96
the long war, I'm going to change two little things a day.

610
00:28:40.96 --> 00:28:41.96
And that's what he did.

611
00:28:41.96 --> 00:28:44.28
So sometimes it's a combination of those two.

612
00:28:44.28 --> 00:28:48.48
Sometimes you've got to give send a little shock of value, like hey, new sheriff and

613
00:28:48.48 --> 00:28:52.32
town, that's what you just saying, the shielding, so new commanding officer would come over.

614
00:28:52.32 --> 00:28:58.88
If you would do a lot of times they do something to assert their presence.

615
00:28:58.88 --> 00:29:00.72
Okay, I'm here now.

616
00:29:00.72 --> 00:29:02.84
No more parking in the back lot.

617
00:29:02.84 --> 00:29:04.84
You know what I mean?

618
00:29:04.84 --> 00:29:06.68
Or, hey, new seal.

619
00:29:06.68 --> 00:29:12.60
I just took over no more wearing this uniform to this place.

620
00:29:12.60 --> 00:29:15.44
Okay, so I haven't got okay, new sheriff and town.

621
00:29:15.44 --> 00:29:17.04
Let's let him get this out of his system.

622
00:29:17.04 --> 00:29:22.60
Oh, this look, do they typically react in that way where they're like, that's why

623
00:29:22.60 --> 00:29:23.96
see what you're doing there?

624
00:29:23.96 --> 00:29:24.96
Pretty much cool.

625
00:29:24.96 --> 00:29:27.20
Pretty much in the sealed teams.

626
00:29:27.20 --> 00:29:30.56
It would be like, okay, yeah, and hey, new sheriff and town, he just came up with a new

627
00:29:30.56 --> 00:29:31.56
rule for us to fall.

628
00:29:31.56 --> 00:29:32.56
So we know he's here.

629
00:29:32.56 --> 00:29:33.56
Cool.

630
00:29:33.56 --> 00:29:34.56
Right.

631
00:29:34.56 --> 00:29:37.12
He's not like some resentment or not.

632
00:29:37.12 --> 00:29:40.68
Maybe the guys that are less mature.

633
00:29:40.68 --> 00:29:43.32
Maybe guys that weren't quite in the game.

634
00:29:43.32 --> 00:29:44.32
Right.

635
00:29:44.32 --> 00:29:45.32
What do you do in this for?

636
00:29:45.32 --> 00:29:46.32
Yeah.

637
00:29:46.32 --> 00:29:47.32
Maybe a hey, bro, don't worry about it.

638
00:29:47.32 --> 00:29:48.32
It's new sheriff down.

639
00:29:48.32 --> 00:29:49.32
He's got it.

640
00:29:49.32 --> 00:29:50.32
He's letting us know where he's here.

641
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:51.32
Yeah.

642
00:29:51.32 --> 00:29:52.32
He's got it.

643
00:29:52.32 --> 00:29:53.32
We got it.

644
00:29:53.32 --> 00:29:54.32
So we're all good.

645
00:29:54.32 --> 00:29:56.76
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:29:56.76 --> 00:29:59.68
But occasionally, he occasionally gets somebody that comes in.

647
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:03.20
You notice the things that I just said were fairly irrelevant.

648
00:30:03.20 --> 00:30:06.16
Like hey, don't wear this uniform to there or hey, don't park in this part.

649
00:30:06.16 --> 00:30:11.96
Whatever, those are fairly inconsequential things and those things are okay, actually.

650
00:30:11.96 --> 00:30:17.96
But occasionally, you'd see somebody come in and try and execute some kind of a fundamental

651
00:30:17.96 --> 00:30:20.76
change and that's where you go away the second bat.

652
00:30:20.76 --> 00:30:24.36
You've been here for a day and a half and you want to execute a fundamental change on

653
00:30:24.36 --> 00:30:25.36
what we're doing here.

654
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:26.64
There's a we have a problem with that.

655
00:30:26.64 --> 00:30:30.20
We as the troops have a problem with that because you don't know how do you know.

656
00:30:30.20 --> 00:30:33.16
We've been doing this for I was at sealed team one for.

657
00:30:33.16 --> 00:30:34.88
Eight years, you know, you're going to show up.

658
00:30:34.88 --> 00:30:36.04
I've been here for five years.

659
00:30:36.04 --> 00:30:38.16
You're going to tell me how it's better to do this.

660
00:30:38.16 --> 00:30:42.28
And that might not be the right attitude for a young guy like myself to have.

661
00:30:42.28 --> 00:30:44.96
But that's the attitude that you're going to generate if you come in and try and make

662
00:30:44.96 --> 00:30:48.16
fundamental changes without assessing.

663
00:30:48.16 --> 00:30:53.84
So show some tactical patience when you come in and say, okay, let me check this out.

664
00:30:53.84 --> 00:30:56.76
Again, just to refer back to the hack, the hack worth story, hack worth was going to

665
00:30:56.76 --> 00:31:00.16
take over a batagon that was all jacked up.

666
00:31:00.16 --> 00:31:03.84
They were called the hopeless, right, and he wanted to turn them into the hardcore.

667
00:31:03.84 --> 00:31:07.72
So he, his shocking thing that he did was meant to shock.

668
00:31:07.72 --> 00:31:10.68
And it was also meant to square them away and was also the right thing to do.

669
00:31:10.68 --> 00:31:12.08
And they also had a bad reputation.

670
00:31:12.08 --> 00:31:15.96
If he went in and took over a really good battalion, he wouldn't go in there with the same

671
00:31:15.96 --> 00:31:19.96
shock and all type treatment because they don't need it.

672
00:31:19.96 --> 00:31:23.28
So you got to, you got to think about what you're doing.

673
00:31:23.28 --> 00:31:28.24
But I mean, most cases unless you're taking over some kind of a problem situation, there

674
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:29.56
you might have to use a little shock.

675
00:31:29.56 --> 00:31:33.000
If you're taking over normal situation, no, the boss got promoted, you're going to go

676
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
in his parole.

677
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Hey, no problem.

678
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.40
Come in there, be humble, listen.

679
00:31:36.40 --> 00:31:38.80
Then as you see fit, make some small incremental changes.

680
00:31:38.80 --> 00:31:44.92
Yeah, like the shocking off thing will probably work against you in a normal situation.

681
00:31:44.92 --> 00:31:46.68
Oh, yeah, it'll definitely work against you.

682
00:31:46.68 --> 00:31:47.68
It'll definitely work against you.

683
00:31:47.68 --> 00:31:49.64
Now you, now, because now you're, now think about it.

684
00:31:49.64 --> 00:31:52.08
Now you're imposing a plan on people.

685
00:31:52.08 --> 00:31:54.96
Yeah, people don't like to have plans imposed upon them.

686
00:31:54.96 --> 00:31:57.32
They don't like it.

687
00:31:57.32 --> 00:31:58.32
They don't like it.

688
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:02.88
Even the big, controlled military, where everyone's in our chain of command?

689
00:32:02.88 --> 00:32:10.88
No, no one in the military likes to have big new ideas imposed upon them without

690
00:32:10.88 --> 00:32:14.64
fought and without assessment and without explanation and without telling people why.

691
00:32:14.64 --> 00:32:15.84
No, you don't do that.

692
00:32:15.84 --> 00:32:18.20
Yeah.

693
00:32:18.20 --> 00:32:23.20
And that what you want and what you want to do is by doing all those things, by building

694
00:32:23.20 --> 00:32:26.56
that trust, by setting the standards, by setting the guidelines, by putting the guard

695
00:32:26.56 --> 00:32:32.56
around someplace, by listening, by respecting, by being humble, what you will do is you

696
00:32:32.56 --> 00:32:37.20
will lead people to lead themselves.

697
00:32:37.20 --> 00:32:41.56
And that's what you want.

698
00:32:41.56 --> 00:32:45.40
Yeah, explaining why I feel like that's maybe an underappreciated thing.

699
00:32:45.40 --> 00:32:48.20
I'll tell you what, it's not underappreciated in my book.

700
00:32:48.20 --> 00:32:52.16
That's the absolute, that is the critical piece.

701
00:32:52.16 --> 00:32:53.16
Oh, yeah, even.

702
00:32:53.16 --> 00:32:54.68
Explain to people why they don't want to know.

703
00:32:54.68 --> 00:32:58.32
You could go in and, I mean, really, when you think about you could go in and change some

704
00:32:58.32 --> 00:33:03.36
fundamental thing, if you explain why and then there was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

705
00:33:03.36 --> 00:33:07.96
But just like, are you saying, if you roll in and you're just, you make a fundamental change.

706
00:33:07.96 --> 00:33:11.16
Everyone's like, bro, we were doing it that way for a reason.

707
00:33:11.16 --> 00:33:14.40
And you just came in, changing, but you explained why and then I'm saying it makes more

708
00:33:14.40 --> 00:33:15.40
sense.

709
00:33:15.40 --> 00:33:17.44
And you get feedback because maybe what you said is a wrong decision.

710
00:33:17.44 --> 00:33:18.44
Yeah.

711
00:33:18.44 --> 00:33:20.72
You might be saying something that's like, you know what, you didn't think that through,

712
00:33:20.72 --> 00:33:21.72
really, all that well.

713
00:33:21.72 --> 00:33:22.72
Yeah.

714
00:33:22.72 --> 00:33:26.08
You needed to discuss this with the, with the troops and figure out what their assessment

715
00:33:26.08 --> 00:33:27.36
of, of your call is.

716
00:33:27.36 --> 00:33:28.36
Yeah.

717
00:33:28.36 --> 00:33:29.36
Yeah.

718
00:33:29.36 --> 00:33:33.56
Again, one of those things where when we talk about like, this is like, yeah, yeah, that makes

719
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:34.56
perfect.

720
00:33:34.56 --> 00:33:35.56
But it's, I don't know.

721
00:33:35.56 --> 00:33:36.56
It's easy.

722
00:33:36.56 --> 00:33:38.88
You know what's funny is on the podcast.

723
00:33:38.88 --> 00:33:44.40
Just as an example, we talked fairly shortly about going to the podcast once

724
00:33:44.40 --> 00:33:46.64
every two weeks, right?

725
00:33:46.64 --> 00:33:48.68
I didn't really give a good explanation of why.

726
00:33:48.68 --> 00:33:50.72
And you know what feedback I got.

727
00:33:50.72 --> 00:33:55.48
It was like, hey, you got to be kidding me.

728
00:33:55.48 --> 00:33:57.72
Well, no, this thing comes out on Wednesday.

729
00:33:57.72 --> 00:33:58.72
Yeah.

730
00:33:58.72 --> 00:33:59.72
Jocco.

731
00:33:59.72 --> 00:34:00.72
I don't know what your problem is.

732
00:34:00.72 --> 00:34:02.72
The podcast comes out on Wednesday.

733
00:34:02.72 --> 00:34:10.000
And I got that feedback from numerous people, not only on social media, but also in, face

734
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.80
to face, you know, people that texted me and called me and said, bro, you can't go

735
00:34:13.80 --> 00:34:14.80
to once a week.

736
00:34:14.80 --> 00:34:19.04
And there were people that say, hey, first of all, if you're going to do that, you

737
00:34:19.04 --> 00:34:22.72
need to set some kind of warning, you need to let people know we need some time.

738
00:34:22.72 --> 00:34:24.44
So it was funny.

739
00:34:24.44 --> 00:34:28.32
But the essential thing that I did not do is say, hey, guys, here's what's going on.

740
00:34:28.32 --> 00:34:33.92
Here's why I would want to do this in a different way.

741
00:34:33.92 --> 00:34:34.96
And I didn't really explain that.

742
00:34:34.96 --> 00:34:37.56
You know, we just kind of, because it wasn't an actual decision that was getting made.

743
00:34:37.56 --> 00:34:39.08
It was a consideration.

744
00:34:39.08 --> 00:34:41.84
The consideration has been revoked by the way.

745
00:34:41.84 --> 00:34:43.40
We're holding the line.

746
00:34:43.40 --> 00:34:44.40
We're holding the line.

747
00:34:44.40 --> 00:34:47.56
And when we do have to do that, which may or may not happen.

748
00:34:47.56 --> 00:34:53.04
And I will explain why in great detail, so everyone understands where I'm coming from.

749
00:34:53.04 --> 00:34:55.48
Because I don't want to leave anybody hanging.

750
00:34:55.48 --> 00:34:59.64
Yeah, I think it can be like, hey, Jocke, I feel like you don't really understand what's

751
00:34:59.64 --> 00:35:01.64
going on here on the front lines.

752
00:35:01.64 --> 00:35:02.96
Yeah, you know, you know, we're the front lines.

753
00:35:02.96 --> 00:35:04.36
We wait for that podcast.

754
00:35:04.36 --> 00:35:06.96
We'll, awesome.

755
00:35:06.96 --> 00:35:08.96
Next question.

756
00:35:08.96 --> 00:35:15.64
Jocke, what are some workouts to progress in becoming more relaxed in the water?

757
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:17.80
I need to lower my heart rate.

758
00:35:17.80 --> 00:35:18.80
Okay.

759
00:35:18.80 --> 00:35:23.32
Again, this is a good question.

760
00:35:23.32 --> 00:35:25.52
It's actually a little bit of a universal question.

761
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:29.88
That's what I like to take questions at apply, universally, to multiple things, becoming

762
00:35:29.88 --> 00:35:33.64
comfortable in the water is very important.

763
00:35:33.64 --> 00:35:35.80
Water makes you better.

764
00:35:35.80 --> 00:35:37.52
Water makes you a better person.

765
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:38.68
And I'll tell you, I've said this before.

766
00:35:38.68 --> 00:35:41.56
In the sealed teams, one of the things that makes us goodness the sealed things.

767
00:35:41.56 --> 00:35:44.96
We have to deal with water and water as a pain in the acid.

768
00:35:44.96 --> 00:35:46.52
The movements, things, it floods things.

769
00:35:46.52 --> 00:35:47.52
It stops.

770
00:35:47.52 --> 00:35:48.52
It stops guns from working.

771
00:35:48.52 --> 00:35:49.92
It stops radios from working.

772
00:35:49.92 --> 00:35:51.92
It stops humans from working.

773
00:35:51.92 --> 00:35:53.16
You drown in it.

774
00:35:53.16 --> 00:35:56.40
It's water is very tough to deal with.

775
00:35:56.40 --> 00:35:58.04
It's a very harsh environment.

776
00:35:58.04 --> 00:35:59.52
Especially the ocean water.

777
00:35:59.52 --> 00:36:03.000
I used to say that every time you go in the water, it's a real world.

778
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Because you can get killed.

779
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
You can get killed in the ocean.

780
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.44
You can get killed in the ocean today.

781
00:36:06.44 --> 00:36:08.20
If you make the wrong moves.

782
00:36:08.20 --> 00:36:11.08
So you definitely need to be comfortable in the water.

783
00:36:11.08 --> 00:36:18.60
Now first things first, water will kill you.

784
00:36:18.60 --> 00:36:19.60
Water will kill you.

785
00:36:19.60 --> 00:36:21.08
You will die.

786
00:36:21.08 --> 00:36:24.64
If you make mistakes in the water, you will die.

787
00:36:24.64 --> 00:36:32.12
So whoever is wrote this question and whoever is going to heed my advice here, note and

788
00:36:32.12 --> 00:36:34.56
be advised that water will kill you.

789
00:36:34.56 --> 00:36:39.44
So when you swim, you've got to have a lifeguard and there's a couple examples of

790
00:36:39.44 --> 00:36:47.28
guys in my that went through seal training with who was a stud, a complete stud.

791
00:36:47.28 --> 00:36:52.56
He was the honor man of my bud's class and a great guy.

792
00:36:52.56 --> 00:36:54.44
I mean, not just, I mean, it's cool to be honor man.

793
00:36:54.44 --> 00:36:55.60
It means you're a good athlete.

794
00:36:55.60 --> 00:36:57.44
But this guy was also beyond that.

795
00:36:57.44 --> 00:36:59.60
It was just a great guy extremely motivated.

796
00:36:59.60 --> 00:37:01.68
His name is Keith Camura.

797
00:37:01.68 --> 00:37:08.16
And he was practicing breath holds.

798
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:12.48
As he was in use, after we went through seal training and he get gone to a seal team

799
00:37:12.48 --> 00:37:16.32
and served and had come back to be a seal instructor.

800
00:37:16.32 --> 00:37:25.08
And he was practicing breath holds during a, during an evolution for the students.

801
00:37:25.08 --> 00:37:28.28
And while all that was going on, you know, they're doing stuff for the students and he's

802
00:37:28.28 --> 00:37:29.68
down their practicing breath holds.

803
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:34.96
On his own kind, he was in the group, but on his own, if that makes sense.

804
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:39.56
So there's a big evolution going on and while this big evolution going on, he's kind of doing

805
00:37:39.56 --> 00:37:40.56
his own thing.

806
00:37:40.56 --> 00:37:41.56
Right.

807
00:37:41.56 --> 00:37:43.96
And he died.

808
00:37:43.96 --> 00:37:45.20
He was doing breath holds.

809
00:37:45.20 --> 00:37:51.96
He stayed down there, he had a shallow water black out and he died and was awful.

810
00:37:51.96 --> 00:37:57.12
I mean, what an incredible, incredible guy.

811
00:37:57.12 --> 00:38:06.96
We also had some seals in 2015 that were in Virginia Beach, young studs, getting after

812
00:38:06.96 --> 00:38:09.72
training super hard.

813
00:38:09.72 --> 00:38:15.76
And they both died in a pool in Virginia Beach.

814
00:38:15.76 --> 00:38:17.56
And again, you know, these are frog men.

815
00:38:17.56 --> 00:38:20.000
These guys are pushing themselves.

816
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.68
And, you know, trying to make themselves better.

817
00:38:23.68 --> 00:38:27.92
And they pushed that envelope and that's what seals do and they pushed it and they went

818
00:38:27.92 --> 00:38:28.92
over the line.

819
00:38:28.92 --> 00:38:32.64
And unfortunately, they were training together at the same time.

820
00:38:32.64 --> 00:38:36.32
So you got to be safe.

821
00:38:36.32 --> 00:38:38.96
You got, don't train alone.

822
00:38:38.96 --> 00:38:43.44
And don't train with someone that's doing the same thing as you at the same.

823
00:38:43.44 --> 00:38:45.56
You can't endure the same thing together.

824
00:38:45.56 --> 00:38:48.60
You know, it's a real, it's a real simple rule to want up one down.

825
00:38:48.60 --> 00:38:51.56
So if it's your turn to train, I stay out.

826
00:38:51.56 --> 00:38:54.52
And then you do your evolutions and then when you're done, okay, now it's my turn to

827
00:38:54.52 --> 00:38:56.92
train, you stay out and you watch me.

828
00:38:56.92 --> 00:38:58.08
It's one up, one down.

829
00:38:58.08 --> 00:39:00.52
That's the, that has to be the standard.

830
00:39:00.52 --> 00:39:03.92
Again, people don't, don't play around with the water.

831
00:39:03.92 --> 00:39:09.24
You know, I've had shallow water blackouts and you, they just come and that's it.

832
00:39:09.24 --> 00:39:10.64
You're unconscious.

833
00:39:10.64 --> 00:39:13.80
And, and if you, if someone's not there to drag you out, you're going to drown.

834
00:39:13.80 --> 00:39:14.80
You're going to die.

835
00:39:14.80 --> 00:39:15.80
That's it.

836
00:39:15.80 --> 00:39:20.32
And then again, it's sort of, you can tell that they're coming a little bit and you get

837
00:39:20.32 --> 00:39:24.24
used to them, but it's sort of like it and choked out in jujitsu.

838
00:39:24.24 --> 00:39:25.88
Yeah, you know, you've been choked out before.

839
00:39:25.88 --> 00:39:26.88
All right.

840
00:39:26.88 --> 00:39:29.52
Yeah, so you think you're going to make it.

841
00:39:29.52 --> 00:39:30.52
Yeah.

842
00:39:30.52 --> 00:39:32.28
And then you don't, and you can push it, too.

843
00:39:32.28 --> 00:39:33.28
That's the thing.

844
00:39:33.28 --> 00:39:36.04
Especially when you're training, like when I'm trying to get stronger at like

845
00:39:36.04 --> 00:39:39.92
chokes and you want to be, if you have some fight in you, you know, you want to be

846
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:42.92
able to, to fight, you know, so you push it a lot of times.

847
00:39:42.92 --> 00:39:46.64
Especially when you have experience, you push it a little bit and then sometimes, because

848
00:39:46.64 --> 00:39:49.20
you just gotta go, you can feel the back out coming.

849
00:39:49.20 --> 00:39:52.56
But once you go right past that point, you can't tap anymore.

850
00:39:52.56 --> 00:39:53.56
You go out.

851
00:39:53.56 --> 00:39:57.40
You did to safe because usually the guy can feel you go out and they let you go, but

852
00:39:57.40 --> 00:40:01.20
probably in the water, it's like it, you know what the event horizon is in a black hole.

853
00:40:01.20 --> 00:40:02.92
Yeah, that little, there's a line.

854
00:40:02.92 --> 00:40:04.36
Yeah, if you go over that line, you're done.

855
00:40:04.36 --> 00:40:06.48
And that's exactly what happens with your consciousness.

856
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:08.92
You, you, you, you, you, you can see that line.

857
00:40:08.92 --> 00:40:10.44
You're watching it like, oh, I'm going to get you.

858
00:40:10.44 --> 00:40:11.28
Okay, I'm going to make it.

859
00:40:11.28 --> 00:40:12.12
And then also it's gone.

860
00:40:12.12 --> 00:40:13.12
Yeah.

861
00:40:13.12 --> 00:40:14.12
And you're over the line.

862
00:40:14.12 --> 00:40:15.12
You're in the black hole.

863
00:40:15.12 --> 00:40:16.12
And that's it.

864
00:40:16.12 --> 00:40:17.12
So be very, very careful when you're doing this.

865
00:40:17.12 --> 00:40:18.12
Always have a swim buddy.

866
00:40:18.12 --> 00:40:21.44
Swim with a lifeguard, all that stuff.

867
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:26.56
Now the question back to the question, beyond the safety portion is how do you get more

868
00:40:26.56 --> 00:40:27.56
comfortable in the water?

869
00:40:27.56 --> 00:40:29.76
You spend time in the water.

870
00:40:29.76 --> 00:40:36.12
Swim surf spear fishing snorkeling, scuba diving, survival floating, breath, hold,

871
00:40:36.12 --> 00:40:37.56
shredding water.

872
00:40:37.56 --> 00:40:40.76
Just, that's how you get comfortable in the waters by being in the water.

873
00:40:40.76 --> 00:40:41.76
Give yourself little challenges.

874
00:40:41.76 --> 00:40:43.84
Swim with swim with teacher, it's in your hand.

875
00:40:43.84 --> 00:40:48.08
Swim with your clothes on, swim, DJ, you're not just all the other things.

876
00:40:48.08 --> 00:40:52.52
Those things to get to be in the water and do things and swim.

877
00:40:52.52 --> 00:40:54.36
And that's how you get more comfortable in the water.

878
00:40:54.36 --> 00:40:59.40
And you'll rapidly increase your ability to be in the water and handle yourself in the

879
00:40:59.40 --> 00:41:01.56
water and you'll be much more calm in the water.

880
00:41:01.56 --> 00:41:05.12
And the reason I said this is a universal question is because it's the same thing with

881
00:41:05.12 --> 00:41:07.20
just about everything else that you're going to do.

882
00:41:07.20 --> 00:41:08.32
It's the same thing with swimming.

883
00:41:08.32 --> 00:41:11.84
It's the same thing with doing, you want to get a pull-ups, do more pull-ups.

884
00:41:11.84 --> 00:41:15.84
You want to get better at public speaking, get up and start doing public speaking.

885
00:41:15.84 --> 00:41:18.80
Everything was shooting, like when people first start shooting and they're all intimidated

886
00:41:18.80 --> 00:41:21.44
by firearms, it's because they're not used to them.

887
00:41:21.44 --> 00:41:25.28
So spend time shooting, spend time around guns, you'll get used to the muscle flash, you

888
00:41:25.28 --> 00:41:29.48
get used to the concussion of the noise and you will be more comfortable about it.

889
00:41:29.48 --> 00:41:31.52
So that's what you need to do in the water.

890
00:41:31.52 --> 00:41:36.84
You spend more time in the water and you'll get better at it, you'll get more comfortable.

891
00:41:36.84 --> 00:41:39.12
Again, be careful when you're doing it.

892
00:41:39.12 --> 00:41:41.88
You'll water, the water will kill you.

893
00:41:41.88 --> 00:41:43.68
It would've de-jocked me.

894
00:41:43.68 --> 00:41:50.68
Oh, it's a term, as far as I know, it comes from buds from seal training, where when you

895
00:41:50.68 --> 00:41:55.44
put your scuba gear on, they call it joc-ing up.

896
00:41:55.44 --> 00:42:00.64
So joc-up in your gear and then it, in the seal teams, it becomes, it's a term that

897
00:42:00.64 --> 00:42:03.36
means any type of getting your clothes on.

898
00:42:03.36 --> 00:42:08.04
You're getting your gear on, getting your clothes on, getting dressed.

899
00:42:08.04 --> 00:42:09.32
Put your jocs, drop on.

900
00:42:09.32 --> 00:42:10.80
I don't know what it is.

901
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:12.44
I don't know if that's where it comes from.

902
00:42:12.44 --> 00:42:14.44
I think you can.

903
00:42:14.44 --> 00:42:18.68
You can, but they used to play, you don't even remember that little kids game hangman?

904
00:42:18.68 --> 00:42:19.68
Yeah.

905
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:21.68
Were you feeling the letters?

906
00:42:21.68 --> 00:42:26.08
Well, whenever the class would make a mistake, they would put, they'd have joc-up

907
00:42:26.08 --> 00:42:31.40
written on the board and they'd put one letter in and then when you spelled out all of

908
00:42:31.40 --> 00:42:36.56
joc-up, then they would make you do joc-up drills, which are not fun.

909
00:42:36.56 --> 00:42:38.12
But it's just putting on stuff.

910
00:42:38.12 --> 00:42:47.80
You're a gear, yes, but the joc-up drills involve ridiculously stupid and hard calisthenic

911
00:42:47.80 --> 00:42:50.80
workouts with your entire gear load out.

912
00:42:50.80 --> 00:42:51.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

913
00:42:51.80 --> 00:42:55.04
They would, you know what, bear crawling is?

914
00:42:55.04 --> 00:42:56.04
Yeah.

915
00:42:56.04 --> 00:42:59.68
So you had to bear crawl with 272 tanks on.

916
00:42:59.68 --> 00:43:02.48
You know, we bear crawl to the chow all.

917
00:43:02.48 --> 00:43:03.88
I mean, it's a mile.

918
00:43:03.88 --> 00:43:08.64
I think our instructors got in trouble for making us bear crawl with them.

919
00:43:08.64 --> 00:43:09.64
Yeah, it's inhumane.

920
00:43:09.64 --> 00:43:10.64
Yeah.

921
00:43:10.64 --> 00:43:13.44
They were like, the Geneva Convention called, it's a bro.

922
00:43:13.44 --> 00:43:14.44
No.

923
00:43:14.44 --> 00:43:15.44
Yeah.

924
00:43:15.44 --> 00:43:17.44
Yeah, we had to bear crawl.

925
00:43:17.44 --> 00:43:19.96
In football, we had to.

926
00:43:19.96 --> 00:43:23.96
There was an incident in camp in football at UH one time.

927
00:43:23.96 --> 00:43:32.32
And, where we're supposed to be, you know, sleeping, you know, lights out whenever.

928
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:38.64
And the guy who remained, no, this is his name is Tupualualu.

929
00:43:38.64 --> 00:43:41.08
This is like when I was young, I was like a freshman.

930
00:43:41.08 --> 00:43:42.96
Tupualu, someone, yeah.

931
00:43:42.96 --> 00:43:48.08
And he, I can say his name now because he admitted it afterwards, but before they were like

932
00:43:48.08 --> 00:43:50.08
it would have to keep his come.

933
00:43:50.08 --> 00:43:51.72
Yeah, yeah, totally classified.

934
00:43:51.72 --> 00:43:53.08
Tupualu, get an after-trip.

935
00:43:53.08 --> 00:43:55.08
Tupualu, what do you do?

936
00:43:55.08 --> 00:43:58.72
Okay, so people were messing about.

937
00:43:58.72 --> 00:43:59.72
We're supposed to be in bed.

938
00:43:59.72 --> 00:44:02.76
What happened?

939
00:44:02.76 --> 00:44:04.68
It's a security comes or whatever and like, we all, everyone hides.

940
00:44:04.68 --> 00:44:06.96
Some say we wasn't me, I wasn't doing it.

941
00:44:06.96 --> 00:44:09.58
And someone threw a sandwich at the security guard.

942
00:44:09.58 --> 00:44:10.58
Hit him.

943
00:44:10.58 --> 00:44:11.58
And it was this big incident.

944
00:44:11.58 --> 00:44:13.92
In and of itself throwing sandwich is a security guard.

945
00:44:13.92 --> 00:44:14.92
That's more funny than anything.

946
00:44:14.92 --> 00:44:16.44
But we're supposed to be in bed.

947
00:44:16.44 --> 00:44:17.44
You know, we're a football team.

948
00:44:17.44 --> 00:44:18.44
You can't do that.

949
00:44:18.44 --> 00:44:21.60
So, it was like, hey, who was this?

950
00:44:21.60 --> 00:44:23.42
If no one admits it, everyone's gonna get punished.

951
00:44:23.42 --> 00:44:25.68
So, of course, everyone gets punished.

952
00:44:25.68 --> 00:44:29.28
We're doing bear calls across the field nonstop.

953
00:44:29.28 --> 00:44:32.16
So it was like I can relate to the bear crawl to the chalho

954
00:44:32.80 --> 00:44:37.10
It wasn't like okay bear crawl to here and then it was like you're going all the way

955
00:44:37.10 --> 00:44:40.38
I don't even know how many times we did it one guy was like

956
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:43.48
Crot was crying so you pissed up

957
00:44:43.48 --> 00:44:49.46
What ever did it face up crying grown men crying? I don't like that guy none less so yeah bear call that's wrong

958
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:55.90
Bear crawl snow joke, but I think jocky up is because you wear your jocks start when you get in the game

959
00:44:55.90 --> 00:45:03.80
Like a juxtap joke, you know, maybe one of the old UDG guys that listens to podcast will contact me and let me know where

960
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:06.56
Jock up came from. Yeah, that's my much

961
00:45:06.56 --> 00:45:12.28
My one is on that's cuz of jock gear in the gearing up. Jock shut up is like the manly, you know

962
00:45:12.92 --> 00:45:14.92
I'm telling not going down this road

963
00:45:15.32 --> 00:45:19.02
But I'm not as I've been I'm already down the road. I can't help that you do that. I can't belong

964
00:45:19.02 --> 00:45:23.02
I'm not gonna agree with you. I think you're wrong. All right. There you go

965
00:45:23.62 --> 00:45:25.62
Yeah, right

966
00:45:25.62 --> 00:45:27.62
Yeah, yeah, there you go

967
00:45:28.82 --> 00:45:33.82
Next question. Yeah, let's go to the next question. I talk about that one anymore. You're using me on it

968
00:45:34.06 --> 00:45:42.90
What's the dichotomy in having an ego when is it good and when does it get to a point where you have to check your ego?

969
00:45:45.06 --> 00:45:47.06
Okay, so

970
00:45:47.54 --> 00:45:49.54
Did dichotomy is pretty clear

971
00:45:49.54 --> 00:45:57.50
Um, ego drives you absolutely it makes you want to win it makes you want to perform well

972
00:45:57.50 --> 00:46:02.46
It makes you proud of your achievements makes you want to be number one

973
00:46:04.18 --> 00:46:07.54
And those are all good things and I fully fully

974
00:46:08.42 --> 00:46:14.62
Have those myself. I mean my ego will keep me up at night trying to win it some ridiculously

975
00:46:14.62 --> 00:46:20.82
Meaningless thing in the world especially when I was younger it was kind of stupid

976
00:46:22.78 --> 00:46:30.82
But the ego can also get you in trouble get you in trouble really really quickly for instance

977
00:46:31.54 --> 00:46:34.58
I mean you can your ego can make you

978
00:46:35.98 --> 00:46:37.98
Sabotage

979
00:46:37.98 --> 00:46:42.42
Your coworker that's all the same team is you so that you can outside of right that's ego

980
00:46:42.42 --> 00:46:46.02
You can vote down a plan a

981
00:46:46.74 --> 00:46:51.98
Better plan because that plan isn't yours. That's your ego

982
00:46:52.90 --> 00:46:54.90
you can

983
00:46:55.26 --> 00:46:57.66
Chase some

984
00:46:57.66 --> 00:47:02.26
Material items some things something that you don't

985
00:47:02.98 --> 00:47:07.98
Really need maybe in some case it might even be something that you don't actually even want and

986
00:47:07.98 --> 00:47:17.36
Hmm and it's just fuel in your ego which is which is a really bizarre thing to see it can make you step on your subordinates, right?

987
00:47:18.66 --> 00:47:26.64
It can make you undercut your peers because that ego flares up it can make you you're gonna make you dig in

988
00:47:27.90 --> 00:47:33.90
Dig in on some stupid ideas that you've had those the kind of things that ego do and all those things are negative

989
00:47:33.90 --> 00:47:35.90
so

990
00:47:37.82 --> 00:47:39.82
That's pretty clear to me

991
00:47:40.14 --> 00:47:47.46
Where ego starts going sideways and and I would say even though like my ego is fuel needed to to want to win

992
00:47:47.46 --> 00:47:53.10
But I'd never was that out of control where I was like screwing and screwing people over because I wanted to win

993
00:47:53.10 --> 00:47:58.98
No, I wouldn't do that that wasn't part of my personality was I'm not that possibly I was never really naturally good at much

994
00:47:58.98 --> 00:48:05.30
So it wasn't like I was gonna wait the only way I could be people and things was better outworking them yeah other than that

995
00:48:05.30 --> 00:48:09.66
I it would be hard for me. Yeah, usually that kind of person who

996
00:48:10.22 --> 00:48:18.52
Like you well the two kinds of people on who who is down to like screw someone over or basically cheat you're cheating is what you're doing it's like

997
00:48:19.74 --> 00:48:25.18
I want to be here. I don't necessarily want to quote unquote win because if you cheat it's not really winning

998
00:48:25.18 --> 00:48:32.22
You know the whole benefit of winning is like overcoming certain things, you know, but when you cheat it's like you're not running and you cheat it you know whatever

999
00:48:32.22 --> 00:48:35.22
So it's less about

1000
00:48:35.82 --> 00:48:37.82
It's more about you

1001
00:48:37.82 --> 00:48:41.98
Understanding really what winning is and that's what you like the winning, you know

1002
00:48:43.22 --> 00:48:48.78
Yes, yes, that's why so like people under my you know cheat and do this stuff. It's like they don't want to win

1003
00:48:48.78 --> 00:48:54.06
I was like you get case and point when I remember when when I was going to see all training

1004
00:48:54.06 --> 00:48:58.10
There was people there was guys that would like brag about it

1005
00:48:58.10 --> 00:49:02.58
They were going through the same seal training class me same buds class me, but they would like brag about it

1006
00:49:02.58 --> 00:49:07.94
And like you could hear him talking to let's say some random person. Yeah, we're on the seal training

1007
00:49:07.94 --> 00:49:11.22
I wasn't brag about that. I was like I'm a lucky him here and

1008
00:49:13.58 --> 00:49:18.18
I realized that a lot of those people quit because they were comfortable

1009
00:49:18.18 --> 00:49:21.32
They they just being able to say like seal training

1010
00:49:21.32 --> 00:49:24.76
They were already good with it. They were like oh, yeah, I did what I'm supposed to do. Yeah, so

1011
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:31.72
Me, I want to do that. I didn't want to say anything until I made it through yeah, and so

1012
00:49:32.44 --> 00:49:34.44
Yeah, so what I'm saying is

1013
00:49:34.68 --> 00:49:37.40
Similar to what you're saying they were satisfied

1014
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.48
Just by being able to throw that out there that was enough for them

1015
00:49:41.48 --> 00:49:46.04
So for someone that's willing to cheat when or they're eat they're willing to step on someone

1016
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:48.44
Man, it doesn't feel good to me. That's never felt good to me

1017
00:49:48.44 --> 00:49:52.36
Like if I got a step on someone I don't even want it. I don't want that victory don't want it

1018
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:59.36
So that it's like they want a some people want to look like they won and other people want to really win. Yeah, of course

1019
00:49:59.36 --> 00:50:03.08
That's really the difference. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so

1020
00:50:03.80 --> 00:50:10.52
Back to ego point when you start feeling like you're doing some of those negative things

1021
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:16.96
That's when you've got to put your ego in check. That's what you've got to support your coworker

1022
00:50:16.96 --> 00:50:22.24
Instead of sabotaging that's when you've got to pick the best plan out there instead of picking your own

1023
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:26.32
That's when you say do you know what I'm happy with what I have

1024
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:29.20
In say to chasing

1025
00:50:29.68 --> 00:50:33.32
Things that I don't even need you know I'm talking about with people like

1026
00:50:33.84 --> 00:50:38.52
If you were there's been something that you wanted even though you actually didn't even really want it

1027
00:50:38.52 --> 00:50:41.82
But you just want it just because you because it's pure ego. Here. You go

1028
00:50:42.28 --> 00:50:44.44
Yeah, like when you're in the weight well

1029
00:50:44.44 --> 00:50:52.12
And growing up like lifting weights. Sometimes you do this where they'd be lifting weights and you can see a lot of times in these like like a 24-hour fitness situation where

1030
00:50:52.72 --> 00:50:54.72
You'll be lift

1031
00:50:54.72 --> 00:50:56.76
Guys will be lifting weights and then one guy will

1032
00:50:57.20 --> 00:50:59.000
He's what they're saying he's lifting kind of a lot

1033
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.64
You'll see someone all of a sudden be doing that same exercise like trying to lift more than that he doesn't know him

1034
00:51:03.64 --> 00:51:07.08
You're not lifting with him. He wasn't even doing that exercise. So wasn't even his work up

1035
00:51:07.08 --> 00:51:10.20
He was like trying to do it, you know, but you weren't even doing that exercise

1036
00:51:10.36 --> 00:51:13.56
You weren't doing bench today and now you're doing bench

1037
00:51:13.56 --> 00:51:15.56
Yeah, chasing something you don't even want

1038
00:51:15.56 --> 00:51:17.56
Don't even need it. Don't need it that day

1039
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:24.48
That's another big one is like when I talk about subordinates instead of cutting down your subordinates

1040
00:51:24.48 --> 00:51:30.84
You start lifting them up you start making them shine you start giving them the credit making them shine even brighter than yourself

1041
00:51:32.28 --> 00:51:34.28
That's that's

1042
00:51:34.28 --> 00:51:37.56
The beautiful thing when you can put your ego in check and you can make that happen

1043
00:51:37.56 --> 00:51:47.56
Making your own boss look good having an open mind to new ideas those are the things that's how you put your ego and check those are the things that

1044
00:51:51.88 --> 00:51:57.88
Those are the those are the hallmarks of having your ego and check now sometimes people don't know when

1045
00:51:57.88 --> 00:52:07.000
They need to put their ego in check and I think there's one really easy indicator to know when you need it just at least

1046
00:52:07.72 --> 00:52:12.000
Like doing assessment of your ego and that is when you come into conflict with another person

1047
00:52:12.64 --> 00:52:14.64
because because

1048
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:21.22
That huge percentage of conflicts that you have with other people are ego are their ego and

1049
00:52:21.22 --> 00:52:28.98
And so when you feel that conflict whether it's about positioning whether it's about an idea whether it's about a plan

1050
00:52:28.98 --> 00:52:34.26
Whether it's about a little amount of what's about but if I'm in conflict with you on something

1051
00:52:34.26 --> 00:52:36.42
I immediately I'm gonna say okay, what is that?

1052
00:52:36.42 --> 00:52:41.38
I'm gonna say you're ego talking or are you is this business or is this ego and

1053
00:52:43.22 --> 00:52:48.30
If you do that you will find yourself you know any form of frustration or

1054
00:52:48.30 --> 00:52:55.02
Anger that you have just check your ego and there's a good chance that you're gonna be able to take that thing

1055
00:52:55.02 --> 00:52:59.58
Get a hold of it and aggressively put it in check. It's hard your ego is a tough bastard

1056
00:52:59.58 --> 00:53:06.94
Your ego man that thing wants the spotlight it wants to shine it wants the glory and it's it's driven

1057
00:53:07.10 --> 00:53:09.90
You know that's a lot of you high achievers out there

1058
00:53:09.90 --> 00:53:17.02
That's what's driving you and it's not a bad thing so when it comes time to harness that bad boy it can be a challenge

1059
00:53:18.26 --> 00:53:20.26
But it's very rewarding when you make it happen

1060
00:53:21.62 --> 00:53:25.26
It's it's rewarding in a long term gratification

1061
00:53:25.42 --> 00:53:27.42
It's not immediate gratification

1062
00:53:27.42 --> 00:53:33.50
Generally you know you're given you're given your support. It's all the credit for some for some project that they did

1063
00:53:33.50 --> 00:53:39.82
Any and you know that you could actually know that you did the bulk of the work. Would you give it away?

1064
00:53:39.82 --> 00:53:41.42
That's not gratifying

1065
00:53:41.42 --> 00:53:46.70
Immediately the immediately is like yeah, that's right put the accolades on my head boss

1066
00:53:48.54 --> 00:53:51.74
That's immediate gratification that you're looking for no you say hey boss

1067
00:53:51.74 --> 00:53:54.70
You know what don't put the accolades on my head look at my team

1068
00:53:54.78 --> 00:53:58.54
Let's crown them because they really did a great job. You know, I'm just here to help them

1069
00:53:59.18 --> 00:54:01.18
There's no gratification there

1070
00:54:01.18 --> 00:54:04.70
But when you get feedback a week later a month later

1071
00:54:05.02 --> 00:54:09.46
Six months later people want to come and work for your team now your team gets picked for another project

1072
00:54:09.58 --> 00:54:14.58
That's the long-term gratification that you get when you keep your ego in check. Yeah

1073
00:54:19.18 --> 00:54:21.18
Keep that ego in check people

1074
00:54:21.18 --> 00:54:22.38
You know

1075
00:54:22.38 --> 00:54:26.26
These are a took extreme ownership over every detail and mistake on

1076
00:54:26.98 --> 00:54:28.98
Of the roofing company I was starting

1077
00:54:28.98 --> 00:54:33.98
But instead of inspiring my employees they just got entitled

1078
00:54:35.46 --> 00:54:39.06
Because of the because of this the business almost ran into the ground

1079
00:54:40.34 --> 00:54:46.38
In addition I got so worn down now my resolve almost collapsed in your estimation what did I do wrong?

1080
00:54:49.98 --> 00:54:51.50
So

1081
00:54:51.50 --> 00:54:55.42
This is an example. I don't see this all the time, but I do see it sometimes

1082
00:54:55.42 --> 00:55:00.02
And what we have here is you know clearly guy

1083
00:55:00.66 --> 00:55:03.70
Steps up and says you know what I'm gonna take ownership. I'm gonna take extreme ownership

1084
00:55:03.70 --> 00:55:07.58
Which is what I'm always encouraging people to do life and I wrote the book

1085
00:55:07.98 --> 00:55:12.34
We call the book extreme ownership because that is the fundamental principle that

1086
00:55:12.90 --> 00:55:17.42
We see as the commentary that makes people successful when they're taking ownership instead of blaming other people

1087
00:55:17.42 --> 00:55:21.78
So that's what this guy did with the roofing company hand-mintake ownership of all the mistakes

1088
00:55:21.78 --> 00:55:25.38
Now the problem there is

1089
00:55:26.82 --> 00:55:32.22
With the the concept of extreme ownership it means taking

1090
00:55:33.06 --> 00:55:36.90
Ownership of the mistakes taking ownership of the problems

1091
00:55:37.66 --> 00:55:39.66
But it doesn't stop there

1092
00:55:39.66 --> 00:55:51.06
That is simply where you start because the real true ownership that you need to take is you need to take extreme ownership of the solutions of

1093
00:55:52.38 --> 00:55:59.42
Implementing the solutions of creating and implementing the solutions that's what you need to take ownership of so in a situation like this like for instance

1094
00:55:59.42 --> 00:56:03.50
Oh, I took ownership everything so my team became entitled

1095
00:56:03.50 --> 00:56:08.46
Now now first of all in in that statement in its own right

1096
00:56:09.02 --> 00:56:12.94
If I say hey, we failed because my team became entitled what did I just do?

1097
00:56:12.94 --> 00:56:17.90
I blame them for becoming entitled why did they become entitled? I allowed them to

1098
00:56:18.86 --> 00:56:22.14
What am I gonna do solve that I either have to train to win I'm treating them

1099
00:56:22.14 --> 00:56:26.38
Maybe there's a couple cancers in there that have that attitude 90 defy are those people or

1100
00:56:26.86 --> 00:56:32.34
Replace them or get them retrained or put some ownership on them so that they realize

1101
00:56:32.34 --> 00:56:37.46
Okay, oh, I'm gonna get I'm gonna lose my job if we're gonna fail this mission or the companies go out of business

1102
00:56:37.46 --> 00:56:39.30
If I don't do this right so you got a

1103
00:56:39.78 --> 00:56:45.22
That's the mistake there what do I so you've identified the problem you take an ownership of it. Hey, we we

1104
00:56:45.22 --> 00:56:47.30
Hey, we got to make sure we get our jobs done on time

1105
00:56:48.02 --> 00:56:52.98
Okay, boss well you didn't order the gear and time and you didn't do this and now we're behind so it's not our fault

1106
00:56:53.14 --> 00:56:57.90
You and by the way, pay me if that's the attitude your employees have you got a problem as a leader

1107
00:56:58.02 --> 00:57:01.06
So what is the problem? How do you fix that problem?

1108
00:57:01.06 --> 00:57:03.06
Um

1109
00:57:03.34 --> 00:57:05.34
The the

1110
00:57:05.74 --> 00:57:10.82
Nothing is about ownership is taking ownership of the problem doesn't fix the problem

1111
00:57:11.62 --> 00:57:15.54
Right it doesn't fix the problem you still have to come up with the solution

1112
00:57:17.22 --> 00:57:19.22
so

1113
00:57:20.14 --> 00:57:21.14
That's what it is

1114
00:57:21.78 --> 00:57:25.78
When we talk about extreme ownership we're definitely not just talking about owning the problems

1115
00:57:25.78 --> 00:57:31.50
But like I said owning the solutions and owning the implementation and actually carry to it's

1116
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:34.50
to it's furthest

1117
00:57:35.66 --> 00:57:42.58
Stretch to it's furthest outcome. That's we have to take extreme ownership of and this is the most important part and obviously

1118
00:57:42.58 --> 00:57:47.26
I need to make this clear enough because this should be something that everyone fundamentally understands when they talk about extreme ownership

1119
00:57:47.26 --> 00:57:53.74
The the most important part for you to own as a leader is the outcome is

1120
00:57:53.74 --> 00:58:02.02
the end state if you are not meeting your end state that's what you have to take ownership of that's what you have to make happen

1121
00:58:02.90 --> 00:58:04.90
so

1122
00:58:04.90 --> 00:58:05.90
That's it

1123
00:58:05.90 --> 00:58:10.70
You know when you're when your company's not doing the right thing. Yeah, you got to take ownership of the mistakes that happen

1124
00:58:11.02 --> 00:58:15.46
You got you got employees that are acting wrong. Yeah. Hey. It's my fault that they're acting wrong

1125
00:58:15.98 --> 00:58:22.06
You got deadlines out your missing guests. My fault that we missed the deadlines now you got to go back and ask yourself the question

1126
00:58:22.06 --> 00:58:25.18
How do I make the deadlines? How do I fix those employees?

1127
00:58:25.18 --> 00:58:29.62
You got to solve those problems that are out there. Otherwise extreme ownership doesn't do anything for you

1128
00:58:29.62 --> 00:58:32.22
And we've talked about this before as well and that is that

1129
00:58:32.98 --> 00:58:34.98
It's taking ownership of things is

1130
00:58:35.62 --> 00:58:38.34
Not a it's not a a shelter

1131
00:58:39.14 --> 00:58:44.30
It does it doesn't provide shelter. Yeah, it doesn't it and some people think it does they go hey, you know what?

1132
00:58:44.30 --> 00:58:47.98
Hey, we missed a we missed we failed on our mission. It's my fault

1133
00:58:47.98 --> 00:58:54.18
Okay, so you know, let's move on no no no actually no we don't move on you failed in your mission

1134
00:58:54.18 --> 00:58:56.18
How you can fix it?

1135
00:58:56.18 --> 00:59:01.06
Extreme ownership does not does not give you any mercy whatsoever

1136
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:07.18
That's what's hard about it and by the way the thing that the thing that extreme ownership that makes it hard

1137
00:59:07.18 --> 00:59:10.50
Is because the the previous question in a taxorego

1138
00:59:11.02 --> 00:59:14.58
Because when you say hey guys, this is my fault. You're not just saying

1139
00:59:14.58 --> 00:59:20.06
Hey guys, this is my fault. Let's move on you're saying this is truly my fault

1140
00:59:20.06 --> 00:59:26.30
We failed because of me and these are the things we're gonna do fix it and I'm gonna own it until we get it done

1141
00:59:27.10 --> 00:59:34.54
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that it kind of makes sense like it is one of those all and nothing things, you know where extreme won't

1142
00:59:34.54 --> 00:59:40.14
He can it's just funny how you put it, you know where you're like I did my extreme ownership

1143
00:59:40.14 --> 00:59:45.54
There's enough to you guys gonna think you can't really do that and this question is is is a really good question

1144
00:59:45.54 --> 00:59:47.74
And I appreciate it because you can see the guy

1145
00:59:48.62 --> 00:59:53.14
That asked it he clearly is motivated wants to do well, but he

1146
00:59:54.54 --> 00:59:57.14
Again my fault for not explaining this well enough

1147
00:59:57.14 --> 01:00:00.86
He thought that just taking ownership would solve the problem no

1148
01:00:01.38 --> 01:00:03.74
You have to take ownership and

1149
01:00:03.74 --> 01:00:10.42
Solve the problem the I met a fact that the taking ownership part is the initial part that lets the rest of it happen

1150
01:00:10.42 --> 01:00:14.78
And then that's why we emphasize it so much because most people they just don't take on it

1151
01:00:14.78 --> 01:00:20.06
They're not even close. Yeah, this guy. He's close. He's taking ownership now. He's got to realize okay

1152
01:00:20.06 --> 01:00:23.90
I took ownership. I realized that it's my fault and it gained. It's not just him saying

1153
01:00:25.50 --> 01:00:31.14
Well, it's my company. So it's my fault and so I hope this works out no don't hope anything

1154
01:00:31.14 --> 01:00:38.98
You fix it you make it happen and I again I appreciate this question because I could see in his earnest asking of the question like he's like man

1155
01:00:38.98 --> 01:00:45.50
What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? Here's what you did wrong? You know you you made the first step

1156
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:51.38
Which is the hardest step that's the positive here one of the most positive things about this guy is he's made the hardest step

1157
01:00:51.38 --> 01:00:53.38
which is okay. This is my fault

1158
01:00:55.06 --> 01:00:59.46
The follow on is what he missed now how do I fix it what do I do to implement it?

1159
01:00:59.46 --> 01:01:05.30
You got lax a day is it go entitled employees that is your fault. So how do you fix them?

1160
01:01:05.86 --> 01:01:08.90
Because if you're laxed as a goal and entitled around me that means I'm doing something wrong

1161
01:01:08.90 --> 01:01:11.54
I mean you don't understand the mission you don't understand why we're doing what we're doing

1162
01:01:11.54 --> 01:01:15.30
You don't understand why it's important to meet the deadline on this roof so we can move on to another one

1163
01:01:15.30 --> 01:01:17.54
So that we can collect money to pay for our next one

1164
01:01:17.54 --> 01:01:22.10
There's all kinds of reasons that you could tell people why these things are important and if you have people that you they know

1165
01:01:22.10 --> 01:01:25.46
Exactly why they're doing what they're doing and they still aren't getting in the game

1166
01:01:25.46 --> 01:01:30.18
You need to find some more people to come and work for you some different people some people with better

1167
01:01:30.18 --> 01:01:34.34
Attitude and bring them on board with the right attitude. Yeah, this some

1168
01:01:35.86 --> 01:01:39.14
Even to add to why this is such a good question is

1169
01:01:40.18 --> 01:01:47.78
This is exactly what people are scared of with the extreme ownership. It's like dang if I take extreme ownership over everything

1170
01:01:47.94 --> 01:01:53.94
They're gonna take advantage or they're gonna you know be entitled or whatever that I think I mean even thinking about it

1171
01:01:53.94 --> 01:01:55.94
That's what I'd be afraid of

1172
01:01:56.18 --> 01:02:00.98
Yeah, I'm afraid of you know and I will tell you having done this my whole career

1173
01:02:01.78 --> 01:02:06.18
When you take ownership of things people don't there there is a small chance

1174
01:02:06.18 --> 01:02:12.18
There's a couple knuckleheads like these the idiots at this guy has working for them that are entitled and now I shouldn't say that

1175
01:02:12.82 --> 01:02:19.14
Because he may have provided the environment to become like he might have been the easy button and every time they say

1176
01:02:19.14 --> 01:02:23.86
Hey boss, I can't fit I get a boss. I can't come and late today. Can you finish up that roof by yourself?

1177
01:02:25.46 --> 01:02:28.98
And he's like hey, you know what I'm gonna take ownership of this right he goes okay. I'm gonna take ownership

1178
01:02:28.98 --> 01:02:33.86
Don't worry about I got it now. He does that four days in a row. He's worked 16 hours days

1179
01:02:34.02 --> 01:02:37.54
He's starting to get broken mentally and physically. You ever done roofing before?

1180
01:02:37.54 --> 01:02:41.94
Yeah, that's hard work especially in the summertime when the blaze and son

1181
01:02:42.50 --> 01:02:46.58
14 16 hour a day. I had to do I pulled a chimney off my little

1182
01:02:46.58 --> 01:02:53.62
Just chimney off my roof one time. I thought I was meal just patched the roof. No, I had to strip like a third of my roof on my house

1183
01:02:53.62 --> 01:02:58.66
And then I'm up there. We got rainstorms coming. I'm up there. Okay. I got to roof this whole thing in the next one

1184
01:02:58.66 --> 01:03:02.02
That was an 18 hours get some yeah

1185
01:03:03.38 --> 01:03:07.38
So roofing is hard work yes, and if

1186
01:03:08.58 --> 01:03:11.94
If you don't take that if you don't if you don't get these employees in the right mindset

1187
01:03:11.94 --> 01:03:18.50
If they're not part of the team if they're not on board how you can fix that if you and what I was gonna say is if you become the easy

1188
01:03:18.50 --> 01:03:24.02
But in all the time then that allows them it fosters the attitude of hey, you know what

1189
01:03:25.46 --> 01:03:28.10
This is on jocco. He's the one that he's still got to pay me

1190
01:03:28.66 --> 01:03:30.90
Like no actually let me tell you how it really works

1191
01:03:30.98 --> 01:03:33.38
You know how I pay you regardless of what you do well

1192
01:03:33.62 --> 01:03:37.30
Eventually I don't pay you anything because you don't work here and I don't have a business anymore

1193
01:03:37.30 --> 01:03:41.86
So if that's where you're at don't want you here and I will do this myself and I'll all schedule

1194
01:03:41.86 --> 01:03:48.10
My jobs appropriately so I can do it all myself if you want to get in the game and be part of this team which you should

1195
01:03:48.90 --> 01:03:50.10
Then

1196
01:03:50.10 --> 01:03:53.54
This is what I need from you here's the expectations. This is why

1197
01:03:54.26 --> 01:03:56.90
Because next year this year we did 14 roofs

1198
01:03:58.02 --> 01:04:01.38
Next year I want to do double that and that means I'm gonna get you a crew

1199
01:04:01.38 --> 01:04:03.78
That's gonna work for you when you're gonna make bump your pay up a little bit

1200
01:04:03.78 --> 01:04:08.10
I'm gonna get you moving along and get you promoted maybe sometime you'll have two or three teams

1201
01:04:08.10 --> 01:04:12.82
Working for you. Do you want to do that or do you want to continue being the guy that's hauling shingles all day?

1202
01:04:13.22 --> 01:04:15.94
Are you in the game with me or not are you part of this gig?

1203
01:04:16.74 --> 01:04:19.70
See so you gotta get in their heads you gotta get them out of that

1204
01:04:20.34 --> 01:04:24.34
mindset and into the right mindset so that you can dominate

1205
01:04:25.06 --> 01:04:28.90
Yeah, I feel like that extreme ownership kind of provides that too you know where if

1206
01:04:29.70 --> 01:04:33.86
Like how you've always said if you're like blaming them overtly blaming them they're like oh

1207
01:04:33.86 --> 01:04:38.66
It's gonna not on my team they have that feeling but if they're like if he's taking the response with it

1208
01:04:38.66 --> 01:04:41.46
It's like oh, thanks guys kind of on my team. Yeah, do you want to do all that?

1209
01:04:42.26 --> 01:04:46.42
Classic you're right classic example if I approach you and I'm like echo

1210
01:04:47.14 --> 01:04:48.98
Dude you're just entitled

1211
01:04:50.42 --> 01:04:54.50
You're entitled you don't have a good attitude. What attitude do you have now? Yeah?

1212
01:04:55.14 --> 01:04:58.26
What attitude do you have now now you're like oh what are you talking about? I'm entitled

1213
01:04:58.26 --> 01:05:05.78
We you're I'm entitled yeah, you're damn right of entitled because look at what I've been doing I've been no where as if I if I take a different approach with you and say

1214
01:05:05.78 --> 01:05:08.26
Man look I think you got a lot of potential you know

1215
01:05:08.26 --> 01:05:10.58
I think you got a lot of know you got a lot of things going on at home

1216
01:05:10.58 --> 01:05:14.98
And I know you got that girlfriend and I know you're doing this and that but you know what I think you got some potential here

1217
01:05:14.98 --> 01:05:16.74
Let me show you what it's gonna lead you know

1218
01:05:16.74 --> 01:05:20.98
I know you don't want to be carrying shingles for extra life and on your knees smack and nails right

1219
01:05:21.70 --> 01:05:25.06
But maybe you could be running a crew and this is how I want to grow

1220
01:05:25.06 --> 01:05:30.98
Do you kind of want to get in the game with me because I think you might you see what I'm saying that's all the takes you understand me. Yes

1221
01:05:33.70 --> 01:05:36.34
Good question. Thanks and good luck with that company

1222
01:05:38.58 --> 01:05:42.66
Small business owners getting after it's hard running a small business. It's hard work

1223
01:05:42.98 --> 01:05:47.06
You are the buck stops of you whether you like it or not because even if you hey

1224
01:05:47.06 --> 01:05:50.26
You know what even if you don't want to take extreme ownership of your small business owner

1225
01:05:50.26 --> 01:05:57.46
Eventually you you're gonna get put on it's on you. It is on you so it's it's great

1226
01:05:57.46 --> 01:06:02.34
I love I love the small business owners getting after it out there next question

1227
01:06:03.86 --> 01:06:07.46
Thoughts on how to deal with toxic slash negative people

1228
01:06:09.14 --> 01:06:11.14
Oh those people

1229
01:06:11.78 --> 01:06:16.50
Yeah, so first of all it's important to recognize that those people exist

1230
01:06:16.50 --> 01:06:21.14
Everywhere and everybody's got to deal with me if you run into one of these people

1231
01:06:22.10 --> 01:06:27.62
Don't get all surprised as if they're alone range or out there being negative no

1232
01:06:27.78 --> 01:06:30.02
There's negative range. Here's all over the place

1233
01:06:30.66 --> 01:06:34.82
So I we got to do you got to know how to deal them and it's

1234
01:06:36.66 --> 01:06:38.58
So so when you're doing what someone like that first of all

1235
01:06:39.94 --> 01:06:41.94
Confronting them

1236
01:06:41.94 --> 01:06:48.58
Of course as you can probably predict is not usually the best option because all you're doing is you're attacking

1237
01:06:48.58 --> 01:06:51.06
They're heavily defended position, which is not good

1238
01:06:51.46 --> 01:06:56.50
So one of the techniques that I use when dealing with these kind of people is

1239
01:06:57.30 --> 01:06:58.10
I

1240
01:06:58.10 --> 01:07:00.10
Absorb

1241
01:07:00.10 --> 01:07:02.10
I absorb

1242
01:07:02.10 --> 01:07:02.90
their

1243
01:07:02.90 --> 01:07:07.62
critiques I absorb their toxicity I absorb their

1244
01:07:07.62 --> 01:07:13.78
Negativity now obviously this takes a little bit of strength right you can't be taken stuff personally you have to in order to learn how to

1245
01:07:13.78 --> 01:07:17.46
Abesorb thing you gotta say if I'm just gonna do in this for the team right but

1246
01:07:18.34 --> 01:07:20.34
it looks like

1247
01:07:20.74 --> 01:07:23.30
For instance when they say oh this is horrible

1248
01:07:24.34 --> 01:07:27.54
I don't say no, it's not horrible. I don't just go right back out of them

1249
01:07:27.54 --> 01:07:32.42
I say yeah, you know what we definitely got some room for improvement right? So I kind of just deflection

1250
01:07:32.42 --> 01:07:34.42
I kind of just

1251
01:07:34.42 --> 01:07:38.66
Sort of it right oh it was sort a bit a little bit because what they want to do is they're lashing out right

1252
01:07:38.74 --> 01:07:43.30
They're throwing the negativity they like those explosions they like to see it hit something and blow up

1253
01:07:43.30 --> 01:07:45.30
They that's what they're doing that's how they roll

1254
01:07:45.54 --> 01:07:49.30
So you're gonna absorb you can catch it pull it in right so when they're like

1255
01:07:50.74 --> 01:07:52.50
We can never do this

1256
01:07:52.50 --> 01:07:58.66
I don't say we can absolutely do this no because you didn't you're just go you're gonna create the explosion that they're looking for

1257
01:07:59.06 --> 01:08:00.34
Instead of saying you don't want

1258
01:08:00.34 --> 01:08:03.62
We might not be able to do it. I'm gonna give it a good solid try

1259
01:08:03.62 --> 01:08:09.86
I'm gonna try and do it right so we're just deflected a little bit and they're gonna throw you some other negative thing and

1260
01:08:11.14 --> 01:08:13.78
You know if they say this is stupid

1261
01:08:14.66 --> 01:08:18.10
I don't say no this is the most brilliant thing I've ever seen. I don't do that

1262
01:08:18.74 --> 01:08:21.62
No go ahead to head. I'm gonna say you know what

1263
01:08:22.42 --> 01:08:26.98
There's definitely some room for improvement the next time around you're right a hundred percent. Oh

1264
01:08:28.10 --> 01:08:30.10
Yeah, you just got deflected

1265
01:08:31.06 --> 01:08:32.26
and

1266
01:08:32.26 --> 01:08:37.62
Those reactions they disarm these ultra negative people and

1267
01:08:39.30 --> 01:08:40.98
It kind of takes their their

1268
01:08:41.94 --> 01:08:45.62
Fight from the minute also makes them look like

1269
01:08:46.26 --> 01:08:50.74
emotional extremists so with the group right when somebody calls that out in the group

1270
01:08:51.06 --> 01:08:54.74
Then they're coming across all extreme and you just absorb it and negated a little bit

1271
01:08:55.86 --> 01:08:59.86
It negates their view or it I shouldn't say negates negates me. It's actually totally loud

1272
01:08:59.86 --> 01:09:02.74
It's across out when you just absorb it and deflect it a little bit

1273
01:09:03.22 --> 01:09:07.38
The rest of the team goes on. Yeah, you know, oh echo. He's just super emotional. He's a negative

1274
01:09:07.62 --> 01:09:10.74
They see him for what he is which help is helpful

1275
01:09:11.86 --> 01:09:14.42
for you right and then once I'm done

1276
01:09:15.06 --> 01:09:20.98
Obsorbing their attacks it taking some of those shots no big deal that I'm gonna start to override them

1277
01:09:21.22 --> 01:09:25.38
What with some with some positivity which is gonna be directed at them

1278
01:09:26.50 --> 01:09:28.34
Right so they were all negative but I'm gonna say

1279
01:09:28.34 --> 01:09:29.70
Hey

1280
01:09:29.70 --> 01:09:34.18
Hey, what you did there really work well or you know, hey, you could jump on that

1281
01:09:34.18 --> 01:09:38.34
I didn't know I did cut I never could have figured that out like you did right so I'm gonna start

1282
01:09:39.38 --> 01:09:41.78
Start getting in their head a little bit and start

1283
01:09:42.34 --> 01:09:48.50
Feeling their head with some positive stuff. That's right. That's all I'm gonna do bad. You figured that out better than anybody

1284
01:09:49.14 --> 01:09:52.18
nicely done and I'm bringing them

1285
01:09:52.18 --> 01:09:59.54
From the dark side over to the light. That's what I'm doing. I'm bringing them over and

1286
01:10:00.18 --> 01:10:05.38
Actually, I just have the funniest up one of my favorite guys in the sealed teams

1287
01:10:06.50 --> 01:10:13.38
He was my he was my first deployment to Iraq. He was the senior elisted guy in our task in it's

1288
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:17.62
And actually we're just bros but

1289
01:10:17.62 --> 01:10:23.94
When one of us would start getting a little off the reservation on something like getting all addicted to some idea or something

1290
01:10:24.34 --> 01:10:29.46
The other one we would would be looking like I'd be telling like we need to do this and this is bullshit

1291
01:10:29.46 --> 01:10:35.06
We need to do and he'd look at me like maybe I took come back come back come back to like

1292
01:10:35.94 --> 01:10:38.26
We're over here. It's okay. We're all gonna be okay

1293
01:10:38.66 --> 01:10:43.38
So when I would start getting negative huge hurt pulling me back to the light right and same thing with with me with him

1294
01:10:43.38 --> 01:10:45.38
he would get you would get all you know

1295
01:10:45.38 --> 01:10:48.74
Get all met a fact he's the guy

1296
01:10:48.74 --> 01:10:50.74
Remember when he talks about

1297
01:10:50.74 --> 01:10:53.78
simplify repeat. Yeah, no simplify

1298
01:10:54.02 --> 01:11:01.78
Amplify and repeat that's it. Yeah, that's him. He would also have to bring me back for the dark side and have to do it to him too if he started getting a little too negative

1299
01:11:04.98 --> 01:11:06.98
Good times but

1300
01:11:06.98 --> 01:11:13.62
The last thing I want to do with someone that's being super negative is I am actually want to I want to give them some ownership

1301
01:11:13.62 --> 01:11:19.22
I want to give them some ownership some ability to make changes some ability to

1302
01:11:20.18 --> 01:11:28.02
Have some kind of a positive impact on the mission so I'm gonna pick something that I think they can step up and handle right something that

1303
01:11:29.54 --> 01:11:35.62
Is within their grasp and realm and ability and I'm gonna give it to him and then I'm gonna give them

1304
01:11:35.62 --> 01:11:43.30
I'm gonna kind of overload them with help and with assistance and with guidance to make sure that they win

1305
01:11:44.82 --> 01:11:50.90
And that's gonna start spinning them in a more positive direction. Yeah, so that's my

1306
01:11:51.78 --> 01:11:56.42
Way to deal with the big negative people out there just absorb

1307
01:11:57.70 --> 01:12:03.30
Yes, I like that I hear maybe like I like how you figured that out and I said this before

1308
01:12:03.30 --> 01:12:08.74
But a good one is to be like to say hey, that's what I like about you you're real

1309
01:12:09.22 --> 01:12:11.54
Whatever xyz, you know you and that feel like

1310
01:12:12.50 --> 01:12:18.02
Because people said that to me that's what I like about you you're real whatever, you know and it makes you want to like continue to be that

1311
01:12:18.02 --> 01:12:21.86
You know and you're like hey, he thinks I'm you know a problem solvers

1312
01:12:21.86 --> 01:12:29.22
I'm gonna be aware and just to continue to solve problems, you know you put the self fulfilling prophecy in their own hands

1313
01:12:29.22 --> 01:12:31.22
Yeah, all the things that you want them to do

1314
01:12:32.02 --> 01:12:33.22
Exactly

1315
01:12:33.22 --> 01:12:35.22
Yeah, that's a good times

1316
01:12:36.26 --> 01:12:43.22
Jockel next question next question. Jockel I'm in I and T. J. Personality

1317
01:12:44.10 --> 01:12:51.06
My drive slash ideas often cause friction with superiors. How can I use my strengths without creating division?

1318
01:12:53.54 --> 01:12:54.90
Okay, I

1319
01:12:54.90 --> 01:12:57.22
So for this one I I kind of had to look up

1320
01:12:57.22 --> 01:13:05.54
This stuff to remember exactly what it was and the like the i and j t r i and t j stuff is

1321
01:13:07.22 --> 01:13:11.54
In introverted intuitive thinking judging this is part of this

1322
01:13:12.82 --> 01:13:16.98
Myers-Brigs type indicator that refers to one of 16

1323
01:13:17.94 --> 01:13:20.66
Psychological types right so it's sort of a graph

1324
01:13:20.66 --> 01:13:28.58
That you can figure out these what type of of 16 different psychological types

1325
01:13:29.86 --> 01:13:36.74
That there are and so so for this one in particular this i and j t which like I said is introverted

1326
01:13:37.38 --> 01:13:39.38
intuitive

1327
01:13:39.14 --> 01:13:47.54
Thinking and judging and I went to the interwebs for this sure and it said that as an i and

1328
01:13:48.02 --> 01:13:50.02
T j

1329
01:13:50.02 --> 01:13:53.22
Your primary mode of living is focused internally

1330
01:13:53.22 --> 01:13:59.06
Internally where you take things in primarily via your intuition

1331
01:13:59.70 --> 01:14:04.74
Your secondary mode is external where you deal with things rationally and logically

1332
01:14:06.42 --> 01:14:08.42
So

1333
01:14:08.66 --> 01:14:10.66
Speaking of

1334
01:14:10.42 --> 01:14:14.50
self fulfilling prophecies this is kind of one of them and

1335
01:14:14.50 --> 01:14:21.30
You know as far as I'm concerned your personality and anyone's personality is not set in stone by by any

1336
01:14:21.46 --> 01:14:23.86
Stretching of course can you have some

1337
01:14:24.66 --> 01:14:27.30
natural tendencies as a person?

1338
01:14:29.06 --> 01:14:33.30
Of course you you do have some natural tendencies and if your brain

1339
01:14:34.34 --> 01:14:38.74
Was on autopilot you would steer towards those personality traits even more but

1340
01:14:39.38 --> 01:14:40.42
luckily

1341
01:14:40.42 --> 01:14:45.46
Our brain is not on autopilot and you have your hands on the wheel

1342
01:14:45.86 --> 01:14:57.86
Had you can control your mind and you can in this case, you know step back and and and get a grip on things that you know according to question that cause friction

1343
01:14:58.74 --> 01:15:00.42
right

1344
01:15:00.42 --> 01:15:02.02
if

1345
01:15:02.02 --> 01:15:06.02
As if as an i and j t you are supposedly

1346
01:15:06.02 --> 01:15:13.78
To demanding and these are little quotes at that if you're too demanding or not open to other people or not open to other ideas

1347
01:15:14.10 --> 01:15:16.10
Here's what you do real simple

1348
01:15:17.14 --> 01:15:19.14
Get less demanding

1349
01:15:19.54 --> 01:15:22.42
Right if you have a hard time

1350
01:15:23.14 --> 01:15:25.14
Listening to other people

1351
01:15:25.14 --> 01:15:27.14
Listen to other people

1352
01:15:27.14 --> 01:15:32.50
If you and this is another quote I got from the i and j t personality matrix

1353
01:15:32.50 --> 01:15:36.66
If you are supposed to have a low tolerance of emotion of in others

1354
01:15:38.18 --> 01:15:39.46
Then

1355
01:15:39.46 --> 01:15:44.50
Get more tolerance for emotions in others this isn't hard

1356
01:15:44.82 --> 01:15:53.86
You identified what the issues are you've heard me say this all the time listen to other people treat them with respect these things are not doing that so do them

1357
01:15:55.46 --> 01:15:58.26
That's that's really simple

1358
01:15:58.26 --> 01:16:06.34
There's no reason to you for you to fulfill this prophecy of being a person that's not open others ideas a person that's not that has low tolerance for other people

1359
01:16:06.66 --> 01:16:10.98
There's there's no reason for you to be overly demanding you don't have to be this way

1360
01:16:11.86 --> 01:16:16.74
Just because that's your personality type allegedly that doesn't mean you have to be that way. Hey, what's this kind of like um

1361
01:16:17.94 --> 01:16:20.90
You know the the Horoscope signs

1362
01:16:21.54 --> 01:16:27.62
Right sure and I do people even talk about those anymore. I don't know my dad well what is it Horoscope or

1363
01:16:27.62 --> 01:16:33.14
Strawl it you struggle. Oh, there's another same thing. Yeah, it was a different yeah, well you read your Horoscope, but the

1364
01:16:33.70 --> 01:16:41.14
The based on the magic of astrology. Yeah, yeah people still do that so so when I

1365
01:16:41.94 --> 01:16:45.54
Well, when I it doesn't happen me to wow, but when I was younger

1366
01:16:47.30 --> 01:16:50.54
People would say you look what what sign are you and I'd say

1367
01:16:51.14 --> 01:16:54.18
You know, I'm a scorpio and they do oh

1368
01:16:54.18 --> 01:16:59.94
I do it until you were a scorpio. You guys yeah, I totally picked you as a scorpio

1369
01:16:59.94 --> 01:17:01.62
I saw that I go actually

1370
01:17:01.62 --> 01:17:03.62
I'm not a scorpio

1371
01:17:04.34 --> 01:17:10.02
And I'd say you know actually I'm a Libra and they'd go oh, oh, no, no, no

1372
01:17:10.02 --> 01:17:12.98
Yeah, for sure you're a Libra all the way

1373
01:17:13.22 --> 01:17:16.58
Definitely because you have this and you're that and I go actually I'm kidding

1374
01:17:16.58 --> 01:17:21.86
I'm I'm actually a Virgo and then they wouldn't trust me anymore and I was a bastard and

1375
01:17:21.86 --> 01:17:27.38
Whatever, but my point is according to some random zodiac calendar

1376
01:17:28.50 --> 01:17:29.54
It's

1377
01:17:29.54 --> 01:17:31.54
You can place those like

1378
01:17:32.02 --> 01:17:37.30
Overlaze on anybody and you can kind of make them fit and that's what I'm saying is like I'm not saying that the

1379
01:17:38.02 --> 01:17:40.02
That the

1380
01:17:40.02 --> 01:17:42.90
NTP or ESJ or LMNOP or whatever

1381
01:17:43.22 --> 01:17:45.94
I'm not saying that the Myers-Briggs thing is just wrong

1382
01:17:45.94 --> 01:17:50.42
I think it's I think it's good to have a framework. I think it's fine to have a framework and say oh, yeah

1383
01:17:50.42 --> 01:17:56.98
I recognize this trade myself or yeah, I recognize that trade myself or I recognize that trade and someone else and then you can deal with it

1384
01:17:56.98 --> 01:17:58.18
I think that's good

1385
01:17:58.18 --> 01:18:00.98
But what I don't what I don't accept is

1386
01:18:01.46 --> 01:18:05.06
saying this is what I am and therefore

1387
01:18:06.26 --> 01:18:10.66
I'm not gonna change no wrong answer if we all just accepted who we are

1388
01:18:10.66 --> 01:18:16.74
You know, you're you're not gonna make any progress, you know, so you find some weaknesses in your personality and you fix them

1389
01:18:17.22 --> 01:18:19.22
That's

1390
01:18:19.22 --> 01:18:25.70
That's what I'm saying adapt yourself evolve get better stop creating fiction friction stop

1391
01:18:26.42 --> 01:18:34.58
Creating division be humble listen take input all those things and I'll tell you one last thing is if you really are

1392
01:18:35.06 --> 01:18:36.02
the

1393
01:18:37.38 --> 01:18:39.86
I and TJ

1394
01:18:39.86 --> 01:18:46.58
The that means that you're smart it means you're thinking it means you're pragmatic it means you're an analytical person you're supposed to be

1395
01:18:46.58 --> 01:18:49.94
All those things so if you are

1396
01:18:50.90 --> 01:18:57.30
Then realize that in order to be successful remember the team you need to put all those little characteristics into check

1397
01:18:59.22 --> 01:19:02.26
Pragatically and make it happen

1398
01:19:02.98 --> 01:19:07.46
One is reading about that very recently about I and JT

1399
01:19:07.46 --> 01:19:08.66
It in the breaks

1400
01:19:09.22 --> 01:19:12.50
Inchills for the other thing introvert extrovert and

1401
01:19:12.50 --> 01:19:20.58
Yeah, so there's that framework and and but as it turns out it's like a bell curve

1402
01:19:21.54 --> 01:19:25.54
Where most people are somewhere in the middle and you kind of bounce in the middle there

1403
01:19:25.86 --> 01:19:32.98
So there's extreme introverts for sure extreme extroverts, but usually it's you you're in the middle, you know

1404
01:19:33.30 --> 01:19:34.90
Cool there's a framework cool

1405
01:19:34.90 --> 01:19:40.90
Another thing with that is is just like a rest of the self-fulfilling thing so

1406
01:19:41.86 --> 01:19:47.62
Effective and I always like say this just to my friends whatever the different like feeling a certain way

1407
01:19:48.18 --> 01:19:52.74
I don't think you should have too much guilt in feeling a certain way like you know sometimes will be like dang

1408
01:19:52.74 --> 01:20:00.66
I felt like I don't know I felt prejudice or something like that and it's because those feelings come from a bunch of things that that a lot of time

1409
01:20:00.66 --> 01:20:08.10
You can't control but behavior is a different so you can feel one thing and behave if your behavior is just based straight up on your feelings

1410
01:20:08.10 --> 01:20:12.10
And that's like that's kind of whack, you know you gotta be smarter. We're okay

1411
01:20:12.10 --> 01:20:15.06
You have these natural feelings cool so you're an intro I

1412
01:20:15.46 --> 01:20:22.10
Whatever and so yeah, you might tend to have certain types of feelings or lack of tolerant for this or you're not tolerant for you know this or that

1413
01:20:22.82 --> 01:20:26.66
So when you're like hey, I'm this therefore it gives me a past a

1414
01:20:26.66 --> 01:20:34.58
Behave this way it's like dang bro you can't do that man and if you're intuitive but I shouldn't you kind of know

1415
01:20:35.86 --> 01:20:43.06
I guess I would think I would hope so but yeah, so again there's a difference between like feelings and behavior and

1416
01:20:43.54 --> 01:20:48.50
Usually I would be in a hall you say like yeah if you want to tough it if you want to be tougher be tougher

1417
01:20:48.50 --> 01:20:52.42
Yeah a lot of times I'd be like well, there's more to it than that and there is really but

1418
01:20:52.42 --> 01:20:59.06
And in this case in a way bro you can really look at it literally like that if you have a lack of tolerance for emotional

1419
01:20:59.06 --> 01:21:01.06
But just tolerate it

1420
01:21:01.06 --> 01:21:11.30
But you yourself I think people do self diagnose and give themselves a pass and I know we did kind of how I think we do it naturally too because I know this

1421
01:21:12.66 --> 01:21:16.90
I'm put it really in big use because I don't call anyone out, but that I know this family where

1422
01:21:18.18 --> 01:21:19.94
The little girls growing up they're like

1423
01:21:19.94 --> 01:21:27.46
They kept telling her hey you're acting this way because you have a lot of not forget what I think as burgers something something

1424
01:21:27.46 --> 01:21:31.22
Yeah, some girls oh, that's just your thing and they didn't like cultivating

1425
01:21:31.22 --> 01:21:36.10
They they were just like real dismissive about it. That's it and then now every time she acted up

1426
01:21:36.10 --> 01:21:41.30
She wouldn't like try to curb her behavior she'll act up and be like that's just my whatever my

1427
01:21:41.30 --> 01:21:49.18
Aspergers or whatever that she like embraced it still behaved you know in whatever way she felt like behaving and then just kind of put it on the

1428
01:21:49.18 --> 01:21:51.18
Aspergers. Yeah

1429
01:21:51.18 --> 01:21:59.50
It's mine control. Yeah, man. It's mine control. You've got I mean obviously you get some people that have some significant you know

1430
01:22:00.86 --> 01:22:03.18
Mental problem. Okay understand, but like

1431
01:22:03.82 --> 01:22:06.62
This person that's writing a logical question

1432
01:22:06.94 --> 01:22:11.98
They got mine control. They just need to say you know what I'm gonna be more open to other people's emotions

1433
01:22:11.98 --> 01:22:17.26
I'm gonna listen other people's ideas. Yeah, go do it now. Yeah. Oh, I'm rejecting echoes

1434
01:22:17.26 --> 01:22:23.82
Echo's idea at point blank range. Okay. That's a signal. I need to not do that. Yeah, I'm open to your idea

1435
01:22:23.82 --> 01:22:29.10
Let me hear it. It's that easy. Yeah, that's just my INTJ acting up. I got it. You know, I gotta check that

1436
01:22:30.54 --> 01:22:32.54
Yeah, the feelings versus behavior thing

1437
01:22:33.66 --> 01:22:39.10
I think is well, it's one of those things where when you know the problem that's like because this person's obviously ahead of the game

1438
01:22:39.10 --> 01:22:45.42
You know, they know you know, they know this is what's causing okay? I can you know I can identify when I feel that stuff coming on

1439
01:22:45.42 --> 01:22:50.86
Very important like it's an ailment, you know, it's not an ailment. It's good still

1440
01:22:52.54 --> 01:22:54.54
All right

1441
01:22:55.50 --> 01:22:57.50
Next question

1442
01:23:00.70 --> 01:23:02.70
Next question

1443
01:23:02.70 --> 01:23:06.06
This is the last one. Go on up. Yeah, I think maybe make this the last one up. Okay

1444
01:23:07.18 --> 01:23:10.78
Jocko, we all know bad things happen to good people sometimes

1445
01:23:10.78 --> 01:23:15.58
How do you deal how do you deal when those things happen to people around you?

1446
01:23:16.70 --> 01:23:18.70
very true that

1447
01:23:18.94 --> 01:23:20.94
sometimes

1448
01:23:21.34 --> 01:23:24.06
Bad things horrible things happen to

1449
01:23:25.34 --> 01:23:27.34
good people and

1450
01:23:30.30 --> 01:23:32.30
I don't I don't know why

1451
01:23:34.78 --> 01:23:36.22
But

1452
01:23:36.22 --> 01:23:38.22
Life isn't fair

1453
01:23:38.22 --> 01:23:40.78
That's that's the reality and

1454
01:23:42.06 --> 01:23:44.06
disease

1455
01:23:44.06 --> 01:23:49.58
Like cancer and MS and horrible diseases and accidents and

1456
01:23:51.26 --> 01:23:53.26
these things

1457
01:23:55.66 --> 01:23:57.66
a good person

1458
01:23:57.66 --> 01:23:59.66
in the wrong place

1459
01:24:00.46 --> 01:24:02.94
in the wrong time can end up

1460
01:24:02.94 --> 01:24:10.22
just a victim of of of of fate and

1461
01:24:11.82 --> 01:24:13.82
end of reality

1462
01:24:16.06 --> 01:24:20.22
and it can be horrible and heart wrenching

1463
01:24:25.02 --> 01:24:27.02
but

1464
01:24:27.02 --> 01:24:29.02
when those

1465
01:24:29.02 --> 01:24:31.02
bad things happen

1466
01:24:33.34 --> 01:24:36.06
to people around you what are you

1467
01:24:37.02 --> 01:24:39.02
going to do

1468
01:24:40.46 --> 01:24:43.18
How are you going to lead?

1469
01:24:44.38 --> 01:24:46.14
Are you going to get angry?

1470
01:24:47.02 --> 01:24:51.98
Are you going to get frustrated or are you going to last shout at people who are you going to last shout at anyways?

1471
01:24:51.98 --> 01:24:58.38
Are you going to start going down the spiral of negativity?

1472
01:25:00.38 --> 01:25:09.02
Are you going to let this horrible situation dictate the way you feel and the way you handle it?

1473
01:25:12.78 --> 01:25:16.54
Are you going to fall over and fall down

1474
01:25:16.54 --> 01:25:22.54
fall apart or

1475
01:25:25.02 --> 01:25:27.02
Or are you going to lead?

1476
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:36.22
Are you going to face this issue with courage and with resolution?

1477
01:25:38.78 --> 01:25:40.22
I say lead

1478
01:25:40.22 --> 01:25:46.22
lead, step up to the challenge

1479
01:25:46.78 --> 01:25:49.74
be the one that other people look to

1480
01:25:51.50 --> 01:25:57.50
absorb that impact, absorb that negativity, draw fire

1481
01:25:59.50 --> 01:26:04.30
draw fire that's that's when a member of a platoon for for tactical reasons

1482
01:26:04.30 --> 01:26:07.50
steps into the open to draw enemy fire

1483
01:26:07.50 --> 01:26:12.38
maybe to give another part of his team the chance to move or distract the enemy

1484
01:26:12.38 --> 01:26:16.38
but that's what I say draw fire bring that pain to me

1485
01:26:18.06 --> 01:26:19.26
I can handle it

1486
01:26:21.58 --> 01:26:24.46
when when maybe others cannot

1487
01:26:27.58 --> 01:26:29.82
when when bad things are happening

1488
01:26:31.02 --> 01:26:34.22
I am going to try and be the one good thing

1489
01:26:34.22 --> 01:26:39.26
the thing standing tall that can be relied upon

1490
01:26:40.94 --> 01:26:47.18
because I know that that attitude will spread

1491
01:26:48.22 --> 01:26:50.78
that will bolster those around me

1492
01:26:52.78 --> 01:26:55.26
and we will fight

1493
01:26:55.26 --> 01:27:00.94
and in fighting we will win

1494
01:27:04.38 --> 01:27:09.98
and if not the battle and if not the war we will win because

1495
01:27:09.98 --> 01:27:13.02
our spirit it will never surrender

1496
01:27:16.30 --> 01:27:16.94
in that

1497
01:27:19.26 --> 01:27:23.90
that is the ultimate victory to hold your head

1498
01:27:23.90 --> 01:27:28.46
high and even even in the face of

1499
01:27:28.46 --> 01:27:30.62
inescapable defeat

1500
01:27:33.90 --> 01:27:37.66
to stand and to fight

1501
01:27:39.34 --> 01:27:42.46
that is to win

1502
01:27:42.46 --> 01:27:56.86
and I think that's all I've got for tonight

1503
01:28:00.46 --> 01:28:05.82
echo let's close this thing out a little bit

1504
01:28:05.82 --> 01:28:14.06
before we do that though let's talk about how the people that are listening to this if you want to listen to more of it

1505
01:28:15.02 --> 01:28:16.54
what's the best way to

1506
01:28:17.90 --> 01:28:20.54
support the podcast what's the best way to

1507
01:28:21.74 --> 01:28:23.74
getting the game here with the boys

1508
01:28:24.78 --> 01:28:27.74
help us keep rolling this thing out what's the best way to go

1509
01:28:27.74 --> 01:28:30.54
do you want to clarify getting the game means a lot

1510
01:28:30.54 --> 01:28:37.18
yeah because it's you're getting in the game and flushing in the game really

1511
01:28:37.18 --> 01:28:43.02
to do that you may or may not need supplementation if you do you like that

1512
01:28:43.02 --> 01:28:46.06
it's like a little bit like a transition

1513
01:28:46.06 --> 01:28:49.58
anyway so supplementation right I need more

1514
01:28:49.58 --> 01:28:53.90
krill oil by the way you should have told me that before we met today

1515
01:28:53.90 --> 01:28:56.62
yeah as opposed to right now

1516
01:28:57.34 --> 01:29:00.38
nonetheless on it on it has best supplements everyone knows that

1517
01:29:00.38 --> 01:29:03.98
I think I think everyone knows that by now but if you want to

1518
01:29:03.98 --> 01:29:09.42
percent off and you're new to on it or even if you have on it stuff and you'll just

1519
01:29:09.42 --> 01:29:12.78
when you're getting more you want to percent off go on it dot com slash jockel

1520
01:29:12.78 --> 01:29:17.10
10 percent off if you really want to step up your supplementation game

1521
01:29:18.06 --> 01:29:21.26
I think I mentioned this like once before but nonetheless

1522
01:29:22.22 --> 01:29:28.46
it's called stay on it so you know how I don't have krill oil right now I didn't stay on it

1523
01:29:28.46 --> 01:29:31.58
so stay on it is boom you hate it's like the monthly

1524
01:29:31.58 --> 01:29:37.18
recurring yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah and in this case it's like um

1525
01:29:38.54 --> 01:29:42.14
it's good because it is one of those things that you need to come back

1526
01:29:42.14 --> 01:29:47.42
yep every month you need you need krill yeah every month yeah and like where

1527
01:29:47.42 --> 01:29:51.82
your bars you need varying levels before your bars per month you know sometimes

1528
01:29:51.82 --> 01:29:56.30
more sometimes less it's true but yeah on the dot com slash jockel 10 percent off boom

1529
01:29:56.30 --> 01:30:00.86
check out all this stuff very good also Amazon

1530
01:30:01.66 --> 01:30:04.94

1531
01:30:04.94 --> 01:30:10.30
destroy by the empire yeah which you know it had a good run and you know cool but

1532
01:30:10.30 --> 01:30:15.50
nonetheless we are still doing the Amazon thing and people do support through Amazon which is good

1533
01:30:15.90 --> 01:30:21.34

1555
01:32:29.90 --> 01:32:41.10
of of joining yeah the movement yeah is that Tuesday night maybe around 11 o'clock depending on where

1556
01:32:41.10 --> 01:32:45.90
you're depending on where you are maybe it's two o'clock in the morning when's it a little icon

1557
01:32:45.90 --> 01:32:52.46
comes up with a little one next to it that you got a new new podcast listen to which is

1558
01:32:52.46 --> 01:32:59.98
which is good to go yeah that one is um what do you call that it's like a cue or something

1559
01:32:59.98 --> 01:33:05.10
and what they expect is what's called the variable reward anyway that's a whole different thing

1560
01:33:05.10 --> 01:33:11.10
nonetheless you'll grow up variable reward go what is this is just like the endorphins thing where

1561
01:33:11.10 --> 01:33:16.94
you see it and you can all excited yeah kind of so variable reward it's like when you it's like

1562
01:33:16.94 --> 01:33:24.14
the really the iconic cases any like Facebook or whatever you see the one the alert I go

1563
01:33:24.14 --> 01:33:29.34
like it's something I don't know what it is it could be someone talking good about me it could be

1564
01:33:29.34 --> 01:33:34.38
someone invited me to play a game it's a variable reward like it could be of something with

1565
01:33:34.38 --> 01:33:38.86
high payoff could be low payoff but I know it's something you know I don't know what it is well

1566
01:33:38.86 --> 01:33:43.82
they decided they want to click on in this case I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm I know it's gonna be

1567
01:33:43.82 --> 01:33:49.74
a high value reward when I see that little one I go yes I get to listen to the podcast and

1568
01:33:49.74 --> 01:33:53.66
I know some people said we're weird I listen to the podcast I have to listen to the podcast so I

1569
01:33:53.66 --> 01:33:59.26
know what A what we talked about B what we could do better yeah see where we need to get better

1570
01:33:59.26 --> 01:34:04.78
yeah all those things so I got to listen to it yeah sometimes even when people you know like

1571
01:34:04.78 --> 01:34:11.50
um a lot of times K the podcast comes out the next day a lot of a lot of slun Twitter are

1572
01:34:11.50 --> 01:34:16.54
bringing up stuff you know that you said or what I said whatever and you're like oh wait yeah I

1573
01:34:16.54 --> 01:34:20.94
didn't know it came off like that whether it's true or not whatever it's kind of like so when you

1574
01:34:20.94 --> 01:34:27.10
listen to it you're like way more in tune now this might be a backhanded compliment or not I'm not sure

1575
01:34:28.30 --> 01:34:36.54
but when you say something cool on the podcast everybody loves it everyone goes nuts

1576
01:34:37.26 --> 01:34:41.18
yeah and I'm not trying to say that you don't say cool things often because I think you say a lot of

1577
01:34:41.18 --> 01:34:46.54
cool things but the ones that people capture and they go yeah heck let's say this and they do like

1578
01:34:46.54 --> 01:34:52.22
they just flood the interwebs with echo Charles's greatness yeah you know what that's like it's like

1579
01:34:53.90 --> 01:34:58.14
one a two year old says like a word or like a one and a half year old says a word

1580
01:35:00.14 --> 01:35:06.62
and they go oh my gosh they said I love you everyone says I love you it's just the fact it's not

1581
01:35:06.62 --> 01:35:11.18
much you said before your record you said something like pretty legit before your recorded today

1582
01:35:11.82 --> 01:35:17.74
what did you say I don't know yeah you do know what you said say it again you get all the people

1583
01:35:17.74 --> 01:35:25.18
excited anyway it might have been something about the jocco store it was a gem I don't remember

1584
01:35:25.18 --> 01:35:31.34
okay always record always record and all the tenacious defense out there you know exactly what I'm

1585
01:35:31.34 --> 01:35:37.50
talking about all right nonetheless jocquist or we could talk about that that's a good way

1586
01:35:37.50 --> 01:35:44.70
to get in the game for sure that's where all the shirts and stuff are that was a really built up

1587
01:35:44.70 --> 01:35:49.66
like bro I'm saying here and here's the thing about the shirts what's on the shirt there's

1588
01:35:49.66 --> 01:35:54.70
a nut there's a hidden or not so hidden meaning so you know a lot of times you know you know

1589
01:35:54.70 --> 01:35:58.14
the meaning you know if you listen to this and you're kind of in the game you know the meaning

1590
01:35:58.14 --> 01:36:05.18
you know but it's not just a shirt with the design there's meaning behind it so that's why so so

1591
01:36:05.18 --> 01:36:11.58
so if you listen you know right basically and if you don't listen then it makes no sense

1592
01:36:11.58 --> 01:36:17.66
it makes less sense put it that way but yeah exactly right there could be some there could be

1593
01:36:17.66 --> 01:36:25.82
some shirts that make no sense to anybody yeah and that's did you see so I put out the my old band

1594
01:36:25.82 --> 01:36:33.82
when I was a kid and I tweeted this picture yeah the t-shirt that we had made my buddy had the

1595
01:36:33.82 --> 01:36:39.42
silk screen still so I held it up the light I took a picture I posted it the name of the band

1596
01:36:39.42 --> 01:36:46.70
was bronzons children as in Charles Bronson who when I was a kid Charles Bronson I thought that he

1597
01:36:46.70 --> 01:36:51.34
was the man and I thought it was the man because he had awesome movies but that he care about that

1598
01:36:51.34 --> 01:36:57.42
he was a war hero he was a he was in the world war two you're purple heart he was a tail gunner

1599
01:36:57.42 --> 01:37:03.02
just to just a bad ask guy and so we me and my buddies we thought Charles Bronson was the man so

1600
01:37:03.02 --> 01:37:08.06
we had our band we called it bronzons children so we run that shirt

1601
01:37:08.70 --> 01:37:12.94
people that might be something people are going to like but who's gonna look at that and

1602
01:37:12.94 --> 01:37:16.94
no have any idea what they're gonna be like hey that kind of looks like Charles Bronson

1603
01:37:16.94 --> 01:37:21.50
doesn't even kind of look like Charles it straight up looks like Charles Bronson yeah they

1604
01:37:21.50 --> 01:37:26.14
won't know no they won't know the idea state of Charles Bronson I don't know it's likeness

1605
01:37:26.14 --> 01:37:31.98
yeah we'd be definitely using this likeness yeah yeah but actually but that's life the

1606
01:37:31.98 --> 01:37:35.90
Jill Ireland she's she died as well I don't know who's I don't know why don't know who's left

1607
01:37:35.90 --> 01:37:41.10
the Bronson family I don't know maybe we could that be a good way to get in contact with them

1608
01:37:41.10 --> 01:37:49.02
start producing their shirts and get sued by them yeah that so Bronson's children would get sued

1609
01:37:49.66 --> 01:37:52.70
you know because your Bronson's still true

1610
01:37:53.90 --> 01:38:01.18
not in the variable reward there um that yep okay I think the shirts are cool currently

1611
01:38:01.18 --> 01:38:05.98
the Bronson children that's a that's a that's a deep one to that's good but they

1612
01:38:05.98 --> 01:38:11.26
have layers like I said and I'm saying that's a good way to support you know like sure some

1613
01:38:11.26 --> 01:38:17.42
get the shirts I would say go go that go jockelstore.com go there look at the shirts you know

1614
01:38:17.42 --> 01:38:22.86
like I'm not getting nothing but just look could you get a rash card there if you're so inclined

1615
01:38:22.86 --> 01:38:26.70
to get a rash card you can get a rash card for sure the rash cards are good I think that's almost

1616
01:38:26.70 --> 01:38:32.14
like on a factual level where they're good well there's a lot of people that are are have

1617
01:38:32.14 --> 01:38:37.34
experience the 19% increase in their jutsu skills or strike levels and running so

1618
01:38:39.90 --> 01:38:45.50
what sucks is so now all my training partners or at least a lot of them are wearing trooper

1619
01:38:45.50 --> 01:38:50.06
rash cards when they fight me so I'm having to fight these guys that are coming at me they all look

1620
01:38:50.06 --> 01:38:54.78
the same they're all monster guys with trooper t-shirt or trooper rash cards on it's not fun I'm getting

1621
01:38:54.78 --> 01:38:59.42
beat up by my own people yeah 19% more than you were yeah 19% more

1622
01:38:59.42 --> 01:39:06.54
stuff man it's rough being jockel sometimes the but yeah the rash cards go at a good kind of like

1623
01:39:06.54 --> 01:39:14.22
kind of email conversation and it's telling me how wakes up in the morning does a run this is in

1624
01:39:15.02 --> 01:39:20.46
totally forgetting where it was but just kind of the serenity contrasted with the true

1625
01:39:20.46 --> 01:39:26.22
barash card it was it was nice nonetheless you know the the rash cards are good if you're into

1626
01:39:26.22 --> 01:39:30.94
it do you do surfing running across it and I know you thought of this I know we thought of this

1627
01:39:30.94 --> 01:39:41.02
but you know it's October right now yeah 2016 and we need we need hoodies what's the status

1630
01:39:58.86 --> 01:40:07.74

1631
01:40:07.74 --> 01:40:14.94
Twitter but all it I said pull over or zip up pull over one yeah for sure I'm strangely I like

1632
01:40:14.94 --> 01:40:21.02
me well yeah that's jacked up I mean actually I asked you long time ago when it was just like a

1633
01:40:21.02 --> 01:40:25.90
theory like an idea and you were like pull over but I didn't agree but I didn't agree I was like

1634
01:40:25.90 --> 01:40:33.50
pull over a cool I don't know this but yeah I I think they're both cool for sure but pull over one

1635
01:40:33.50 --> 01:40:38.94
yeah kind of my alliance like two yeah it's crazy no doubt nonetheless oh yeah pull over there you go

1636
01:40:38.94 --> 01:40:45.90
on the way two weeks there should be solid and then you know other stuff some girls tanks

1637
01:40:45.90 --> 01:40:53.34
t-shirts coming out girls t-shirts you're getting abused by the girls yeah we'll just say

1638
01:40:53.34 --> 01:41:00.78
per suede it I see them roughing up per suede they chose not to flank but per suede and then

1639
01:41:00.78 --> 01:41:05.82
the last okay you know they were they're all about the direct action for sure so some women

1640
01:41:05.82 --> 01:41:12.70
stuff on there and more and then some patches again with the the size of the Velcro patches

1641
01:41:13.58 --> 01:41:18.54
the two by three is on the way right now they're four by four across three inches down that's big

1642
01:41:18.54 --> 01:41:24.38
for the standard Velcro interchangeable right yeah so just know that all my three's are on the way

1643
01:41:24.38 --> 01:41:29.58
yeah good I mean you know four with three is fine I guess but not for if you're interchangeable and you

1644
01:41:29.58 --> 01:41:37.18
got two by three no for all the military guys and law enforcement they need three by two and this is

1645
01:41:37.18 --> 01:41:43.74
I should have told you that made it a little more clear yeah but anyways none live and we learn yeah

1646
01:41:43.74 --> 01:41:49.82
so the main thing go there jocquistord.com is just the story with everything again if you don't like
