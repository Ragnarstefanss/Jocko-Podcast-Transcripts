[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 11 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:10] And additionally today we have our first guest, Lathe Badham.
[00:00:17] Lathe welcome to the show.
[00:00:18] Thank you, glad to be here with you.
[00:00:21] Now to begin this podcast today, I'm going to start at the end.
[00:00:26] I'm going to start at the end of my Navy career when I retired from the seal teams after
[00:00:33] 20 years.
[00:00:36] And this is the speech that I gave on my last day of military service, my last day in the
[00:00:41] seal teams in about an hour before I walked back to the trade at building, cleaned the last
[00:00:48] things out of my locker, loaded them into my car, and drove away from the seal teams for
[00:00:56] the last time.
[00:00:59] With 20 years of memories and experiences and the best times of my life and the worst times
[00:01:06] of my life, all rushing through my mind.
[00:01:13] And this is the speech I gave that day.
[00:01:21] During my last deployment to Iraq in 2006, one of the first things we did was a series
[00:01:26] of operations on the eastern side of our body.
[00:01:30] In order to execute these operations, we took a majority of the seals to camp Corregador,
[00:01:36] home with the first of the 506 band of brothers, on the edge of the Malab district of
[00:01:41] the Marama of Ramadi.
[00:01:44] Camp Corregador was like four to pop lips.
[00:01:48] They received mortar fire, RPGs, and small arms fire daily.
[00:01:54] The barracks were an old partially blown out building with sandbags and the windows, dirt
[00:01:59] floors, and nowhere conditioning.
[00:02:02] There were no showers.
[00:02:04] It was hard-living.
[00:02:08] As far as the fighting, Charlie Company, from the first of the 506 who we were set to work
[00:02:14] with, had suffered almost 40 casualties in the time they had been in Ramadi and had gone
[00:02:20] from a fighting force of 140 to just over 100.
[00:02:26] Charlie Company loved having seals with them.
[00:02:29] After the first operation they conducted with seals, the company commander told his
[00:02:33] battalion CEO he wanted seals with him on every mission to help keep his men alive.
[00:02:41] As we continued these initial operations into the Malab district, there were heavy firefights,
[00:02:46] many dead enemy, and multiple coalition casualties.
[00:02:51] It was intense, sustained combat.
[00:02:57] Many would have considered camp Corregador an eastern Ramadi to be hell on earth.
[00:03:03] I knew it was exactly where seals belonged.
[00:03:07] We soon completed that first run of missions and headed back to our main camp.
[00:03:13] When we got there, I told one of the platoon commanders I wanted him to select guys to form
[00:03:18] a seven-man squad to take back to camp Corregador.
[00:03:24] But he told me he didn't want to just pick guys.
[00:03:28] He thought that some guys might not want to go back to Corregador due to the hard-living
[00:03:32] conditions, the tough fighting, and the high rate of casualties.
[00:03:38] That sounded reasonable to me, so I mustered the whole troop in the planning space.
[00:03:43] I explained to them that we were sending a squad to Corregador permanently because the army
[00:03:48] isn't a tough fight and suffering heavy casualties, and that as Americans as servicemen
[00:03:55] and as frogmen we cannot sit on the sidelines as that happens.
[00:03:59] If there's a fight, we need to be in it.
[00:04:05] I wrote on the dry erase board camp Corregador volunteers, and I said to this pack of seals,
[00:04:13] if you want to go over to Corregador, if you want to volunteer to be in the worst area
[00:04:17] with the worst-living conditions, with the hardest fighting, and with the highest chances
[00:04:21] of getting hurt or killed, then go ahead and write your name up on that board.
[00:04:28] And then I walked out of the room.
[00:04:30] A short while later, I came back in and I looked at the list on the board.
[00:04:40] It was filled.
[00:04:42] In fact, every single seal to a man had written his name on that board.
[00:04:48] Yes, every man had volunteered to go forward into that raging storm.
[00:05:04] And that is who we are.
[00:05:08] That is what we joined the seal teams for.
[00:05:11] To do what no one else can do.
[00:05:14] In the worst areas, in the worst conditions, we crave the dirt and sweat and fire and blood.
[00:05:23] Let there be no doubt.
[00:05:26] It is in our soul.
[00:05:27] It is in our nature.
[00:05:32] Sure seals can do any job well, but it isn't the belly of the beast where we thrive.
[00:05:38] I have seen with my own eyes the wholesale slaughter that occurs when seals are unleashed on the enemy
[00:05:44] as we were meant to be.
[00:05:47] And it is incredible thing.
[00:05:50] It is also a thing of strategic impact.
[00:05:53] Areas like Ramadi and Satter City, which after years of complete enemy control, become
[00:05:59] pacified, soon after the sword of overwhelming carnage, is wielded by the frogmen on
[00:06:06] the high ground.
[00:06:09] This is who we are.
[00:06:11] Death dealers, killers, executioners, and in being so, saviors, defenders, warriors.
[00:06:26] Now there are those that say we need to change, evolve and mature.
[00:06:33] They claim that the nature of war has changed, that it is more complex and demands a more
[00:06:38] sensitive approach.
[00:06:41] I say they are wrong.
[00:06:45] War may morph and appear different through the ages.
[00:06:49] And when you live through a war and you see it up close like we are now, you may notice
[00:06:55] complexities that you didn't perceive about the wars you studied in history class.
[00:07:02] But I tell you, there is nothing new.
[00:07:07] The nature of war has never changed and never will change.
[00:07:12] The nature of war is death.
[00:07:14] To kill the enemy before he kills you.
[00:07:18] The rest is details.
[00:07:24] Now of course we can handle the details.
[00:07:27] In fact, seals can excel at all of them, gathering intelligence, assembling in from
[00:07:32] information, forming alliances, rebuilding communities, training, protecting, treating,
[00:07:39] seals can do anything.
[00:07:42] But these details can also be done by others.
[00:07:46] You don't need to be a seal to conduct those activities.
[00:07:50] I say, send seals forward into the violent fray.
[00:07:56] Senses will no one else can go to do what no one else can do.
[00:08:00] The seal to find and butcher our enemy's soulless masses and leave nothing behind but
[00:08:05] scorched earth and rubbled buildings.
[00:08:09] That is our nature.
[00:08:13] As I look at the seal teams today, I say to you all, yes, absolutely evolve.
[00:08:20] Get smarter, better, faster, more creative.
[00:08:25] Learn to mitigate risk when you can.
[00:08:28] Figure out new ways to win.
[00:08:32] Attack the enemy in new ways using information and intelligence.
[00:08:37] Infiltrate the enemy and turn him against himself, evil against evil.
[00:08:43] Adapt and overcome changing enemy tactics.
[00:08:48] By all means, evolve and get better every day, every chance you get.
[00:08:56] You don't forget the nature of war and don't forget the nature of seals.
[00:09:03] We must train brutally and without mercy so we can fight the same way, brutally and without
[00:09:10] mercy.
[00:09:12] Our job is to close with and destroy the enemy and we do it better than anyone.
[00:09:18] Yes, our current wars will someday end.
[00:09:24] World war indoors before man was war weighted for him.
[00:09:30] As long as man is, war will always be.
[00:09:34] Always.
[00:09:39] And our great nation will always need men to do what is in our nature.
[00:09:45] Kill the enemy.
[00:09:46] Kill him as he sleeps.
[00:09:48] Kill him as he plots.
[00:09:49] Kill him as he hides.
[00:09:51] Kill him as he fights.
[00:09:53] That is our nature and that is our solemn duty.
[00:10:03] Light the fire.
[00:10:06] Take the torch, hold it high.
[00:10:09] Let it burn bright.
[00:10:13] Let it supply the warmth and light of freedom and liberty for our countrymen.
[00:10:19] And also let the fire and sinnerate our enemy.
[00:10:23] Let the inferno consume everything he is, everything he ever will be and everything he has
[00:10:29] ever held sacred.
[00:10:34] As I walk away from the teams today, I assure you I will never forget.
[00:10:41] I will never forget your service and sacrifice.
[00:10:44] I will never forget you, my fellow seals, forgetting me here to this day for leading me,
[00:10:50] for following me and for watching my back.
[00:10:54] I will never forget our fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that are fought and
[00:10:59] sacrificed so much.
[00:11:02] I will never forget those big tough frog men and hardcore seals that came before me.
[00:11:08] Particularly the ones that raised me in the teams and taught me the true way of the frog
[00:11:14] man.
[00:11:16] And finally, I will never forget our fallen brothers, the many seals who have sacrificed their
[00:11:22] lives for our freedom.
[00:11:25] Especially Mark Lee, Mike Mansour and Ryan Job of Seal Team 3 Task Unit Bruser who lived
[00:11:34] and fought and died like warriors.
[00:11:42] I am humbled to have served with you all and I will never forget.
[00:11:47] Thank you.
[00:11:49] God bless the teams and God bless the United States of America.
[00:11:54] And then I walked away.
[00:12:02] Now I often talk about the Marine Corps and I talk about the Army soldiers and I talk
[00:12:11] about the immense respect and admiration that I and that we as seals have for them.
[00:12:21] But if you haven't noticed, I don't usually talk about the seal teams and the frogmen
[00:12:27] that filled those ranks, probably because I was raised not to talk about what we do.
[00:12:35] But let there be no doubt.
[00:12:38] I hold the seal teams and the brotherhood of the teams sacred.
[00:12:43] The seal teams is not just what I did, it is who I am.
[00:12:50] And really, it all culminated.
[00:12:53] It reached his peak in the highlight of my life, which was being in command of Task Unit
[00:13:00] Bruser in Ramadi, Iraq.
[00:13:06] The student Bruser was my vision of the teams.
[00:13:10] It was everything I had always wanted the teams to be.
[00:13:14] Badass frogmen, tough, mean, funny, aggressive, professional seals.
[00:13:22] Seals that take the fight to the enemy.
[00:13:26] Like our legendary forefathers in Vietnam, seals that the enemy feared because we haunted
[00:13:31] them down and killed them.
[00:13:36] Task Unit Bruser was what I always wanted the seal teams to be.
[00:13:44] But I was not Task Unit Bruser.
[00:13:49] Yes, I was the commander, but Task Unit Bruser was by no means me.
[00:13:57] Task Unit Bruser was the men, especially a core group within the group that held the standard
[00:14:03] and carried the fire.
[00:14:08] It was those men that I am internally indebted for, for giving me that gift, for fulfilling
[00:14:16] the vision that I had, men like Mark Lee and Mike Montsour and Ryan Job, men like Chris
[00:14:25] Kyle.
[00:14:26] And those are the ones that we talk about, we talk about them only because they are gone.
[00:14:36] But there were many others in that core group who go on silently unknown to the world,
[00:14:42] most of whom are still in the fight.
[00:14:47] And it was those men, of course those fallen warriors that made the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:14:55] But also those unnamed men of Task Unit Bruser who held the line and marched into the
[00:15:02] fray over and over again for me and for the teams and for the navy and for our great nation.
[00:15:28] One of them here tonight, his name is Lave Babin.
[00:15:35] And I'm going to let him talk about where he comes from and how we ended up in the teams.
[00:15:40] But before I do that I want to tell you something about Lave.
[00:15:44] After we got done with our work up and before we went on deployment, before we went
[00:15:49] to Ramadi.
[00:15:50] I was talking to Lave and I was talking to the other platoon commander together, the Delta
[00:15:54] Platoon commander and Lave was the Charlie Platoon commander.
[00:15:59] And I said to them, both, I'm going to get you guys more combat than you can take.
[00:16:04] I'm going to break you.
[00:16:08] And I was half joking.
[00:16:11] But at the same time, I had actually already seen men break during a fairly simple deployment
[00:16:19] to Iraq.
[00:16:22] But I knew I would push these guys hard.
[00:16:26] And through timing and fate and force of will, the battle field of Ramadi gave me the
[00:16:35] opportunity to make that happen, to push them and try and give them more combat than they
[00:16:41] could take.
[00:16:48] But they took it.
[00:16:50] And they took it far beyond what I ever could have asked for.
[00:16:55] These two officers, the platoon commanders, and with them that core group of fragment of
[00:17:01] warriors in Task Unit Bruser, they never wavered.
[00:17:08] They never coward.
[00:17:11] They never faltered.
[00:17:17] They were in the face of bombs and bullets and fire and death.
[00:17:23] They held true.
[00:17:29] And I will never forget that.
[00:17:34] And so here is one of those men.
[00:17:38] One of that core group of hard warriors from Task Unit Bruser that held the line.
[00:17:47] My friend, my teammate and my brother, Lave Babin.
[00:17:56] Galco thanks for having me.
[00:17:59] I'm fired up to be here.
[00:18:01] Yeah.
[00:18:02] So it's interesting because, like I said, I mean, as I go back and listen to podcasts and
[00:18:10] hear what I talk about and how much respect and admiration that I always talk about.
[00:18:17] For the Marine Corps and for the Army.
[00:18:19] And I seldom talk about the boys.
[00:18:24] And as I was getting ready to have you on as the first guest, which is very appropriate,
[00:18:29] I wanted to make sure that everybody understood where I was coming from.
[00:18:40] And I think people were really excited that you're going to be on.
[00:18:46] Having a lot of them read the book that you and I wrote together extreme ownership.
[00:18:52] And being intrigued about that and having had me on the podcast and talk about my life,
[00:19:01] people are interested here in a little bit about your life.
[00:19:05] That's kind of one of the first questions that came across as soon as I told everyone that
[00:19:10] you were going to be on the podcast.
[00:19:12] And that was, you know, what was, here's a question.
[00:19:17] First question of the day.
[00:19:18] Let's break it down.
[00:19:21] What was the motivation behind life becoming a seal?
[00:19:26] And if he can give a brief resume of his career in the forces, break out your resume.
[00:19:37] I don't ever remember what to do anything else.
[00:19:40] And I've heard you say, you know, that you wanted to go be a commandil.
[00:19:46] I've never said you could remember being wanting to do anything.
[00:19:50] And I think I was exactly the same way.
[00:19:52] It was, I felt growing up.
[00:19:53] I grew up in the Pani Woods of Southeast Texas in a rural small town.
[00:19:58] And we're high school football is everything.
[00:20:01] It's just a few thousand people in the town.
[00:20:03] You get at least that or more at the games or Friday night lights every Friday.
[00:20:10] And I ran around the woods.
[00:20:13] I played Army and I wanted to be a combat leader.
[00:20:17] That's what I wanted to do.
[00:20:18] And I played Sandbox, my GI Joe figures, my little plastic army men.
[00:20:23] And that just kind of what I wanted to do.
[00:20:24] And then when I was, when I was probably in, I was probably in about junior high school.
[00:20:31] And I was kind of figuring out, I hear about the green berets.
[00:20:34] I had a cousin that was a green beret, highly decorated silver star recipient from Vietnam.
[00:20:40] And he was kind of a mentor to my dad growing up.
[00:20:44] And so I heard a little bit about some of those, you know, the snake eaters and sort of
[00:20:49] ring some books.
[00:20:50] And I sort of learned about the seal teams.
[00:20:52] And I remember distinctly a little movie coming out.
[00:20:58] And I think it was 1990.
[00:20:59] But a little movie called Navy Seals, starring Charlie Sheen, who's all about winning.
[00:21:06] And he should have actually joined the teams and saved the team.
[00:21:10] He'd probably be a better shape right now.
[00:21:12] No doubt.
[00:21:13] You definitely would have been better for him.
[00:21:15] No doubt.
[00:21:16] But that really was something that kind of propelled me out.
[00:21:20] What is this?
[00:21:21] Or is this sort of reading about it?
[00:21:22] Sort of learning about it.
[00:21:23] Reading a lot of books about seals and Vietnam.
[00:21:26] And decided that that's what I wanted to do.
[00:21:29] I wanted to be a seal.
[00:21:30] So I went to the Naval Canada, pursue that dream.
[00:21:33] And I knew that's what I wanted to do.
[00:21:37] I turned down an appointment to West Point because I wanted to go Navy.
[00:21:40] I wanted to be a seal.
[00:21:41] And law and behold, as I graduated from the Naval care, I came up with a service selection
[00:21:45] night before our graduation.
[00:21:47] I did not get selected for the seal teams.
[00:21:49] And that was crushing.
[00:21:50] It was a soul crushing of that for me.
[00:21:53] To think that I was going to go out in the surface fleet.
[00:21:56] I wasn't going to be a seal.
[00:21:57] I was going to go be on a ship.
[00:21:59] Be a service war for our officer.
[00:22:02] Yet it took me three years.
[00:22:03] I continue to pursue that.
[00:22:05] And persevere to a lot of challenges.
[00:22:07] And through a lot of luck.
[00:22:08] And a lot of our work, the doors were open for me to be able to go to get a bill to go.
[00:22:14] And I had some outstanding mentors that looked out for me.
[00:22:16] It opened some doors for me to make that happen.
[00:22:19] And then I was able to go and go to Buds, our seal training.
[00:22:23] And when I was there, I think looking back on that time in the surface fleet was awesome
[00:22:28] for me.
[00:22:29] It allowed me to gain immense responsibility and maturity.
[00:22:34] But I probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
[00:22:37] And in kind of the peacetime, pre-911 seal teams as an assistant to a commander, they
[00:22:41] wouldn't have an opportunity for leadership.
[00:22:43] And so I was thrust into leadership positions in the surface fleet.
[00:22:46] And I gained that.
[00:22:47] And I also gained a measure of just appreciation for where I was.
[00:22:50] And whenever one was, when other folks were whining about how tough training was, I was
[00:22:55] just excited and fired up to be there just for the opportunity.
[00:22:59] And so for me, I went and served at a seal team as a assistant to a commander and certainly
[00:23:06] the highlight of my time of the teams was working at the task of the bruser.
[00:23:10] And I felt like that's where I had not had that experience, which I almost didn't get,
[00:23:19] by the way.
[00:23:20] I mean, that was, I wanted to stay at, I was at seal team five.
[00:23:23] And I wanted to stay at seal team five with the guys that I loved and trained with.
[00:23:27] And I, my commanding officer at the time said, no, you're seeing you're going to rotate
[00:23:30] you to seal team three.
[00:23:31] You're going to deploy six months ahead.
[00:23:33] I was furious about that.
[00:23:36] Then I was going over there in Lomba Hold.
[00:23:38] I get over and get the word for Jocco and task in it, bruser.
[00:23:41] And that was an amazing crew of guys from Charlie Batoon.
[00:23:44] That was, and it just wouldn't have been the same otherwise.
[00:23:48] And I still love the boys from Team Five of course, but it was just a phenomenal experience
[00:23:53] to be able to have that.
[00:23:54] To talk me to be the combat leader, I needed to be through a workup cycle, preparing me
[00:23:59] and then unleashed me and Charlie Batoon on the battlefield to get after it in a way
[00:24:03] that was phenomenal where we were able to have a historic deployment that made it impact
[00:24:09] and save a lot of lives and to tremendous damage to the enemy.
[00:24:11] And we came back from that from lessons learned, provided tons of lessons learned and taught
[00:24:16] seal leaders for the next generation.
[00:24:20] And that, that to me was such an incredibly rewarding experience.
[00:24:23] And I think someone that built our company now, Eschelon, for what we're doing and the ideas
[00:24:29] that have become the book, Extreme Ownership, where when I was teaching that leadership
[00:24:34] training and you were running training for the West Coast teams, providing those lessons
[00:24:38] learned to teach guys to be ready for those most difficult combat situations.
[00:24:44] And I was proud to train those guys and see the next generation of seal leaders go out
[00:24:49] on the battlefield and accomplish some extraordinary stuff and reprove the principles
[00:24:54] that we learned and revalidate them in different environments.
[00:24:59] And that was incredibly rewarding for me and I think really shaped when I decided to get out
[00:25:03] a few years ago after you'd retired and really shaped what this has become and it's still
[00:25:08] rewarding to work with leaders in all aspects of businesses across industries and see them,
[00:25:15] see the light bulb come off in their head and watch them just go get after it and lead
[00:25:20] and win.
[00:25:21] Hey back when you said that you weren't selected to be a seal, what does that mean?
[00:25:28] You have to be selected.
[00:25:30] I can't just, hey I want to be a seal, let me join Buds.
[00:25:34] Let me get through that and become a seal.
[00:25:36] Like how does that work?
[00:25:37] You have to get a billet to go.
[00:25:38] We call it billets.
[00:25:39] What does that mean?
[00:25:40] That means that you have a slot.
[00:25:41] You get a slot.
[00:25:42] Here's an opportunity and for us.
[00:25:44] We're coming out of the Naval County.
[00:25:45] We had 16 seal billets.
[00:25:48] So 16 people got to go.
[00:25:49] We had a priori list of seal in my class.
[00:25:50] Only 15 guys were getting to go.
[00:25:52] Probably had 200 people that wanted to go be a seal and you go through a screening process.
[00:25:57] And after that you may be have 60 or 80 people that are eligible to go and at least
[00:26:02] 15 of those are going to get selected.
[00:26:03] I was not one of those 15.
[00:26:05] So as far as the process goes then you can't just be some dude.
[00:26:09] Like the screening process how you're saying.
[00:26:11] That's the case that you're missing is that there's two basically two parts of the military.
[00:26:18] There's officers.
[00:26:19] And there's enlisted guys.
[00:26:21] And they're officers.
[00:26:22] The basic requirement being officers you have to have a college degree.
[00:26:24] If you have a college degree then you can become an officer.
[00:26:27] And if you don't have a college degree then you're an enlisted guy.
[00:26:29] I enlisted in the Navy out of high school didn't have a degree.
[00:26:34] And therefore I had to.
[00:26:35] Therefore it was pretty easy to get to go to seal training because they take they need
[00:26:40] more enlisted seals than they need officers.
[00:26:44] And so it's pretty easy to get what they've talking about a billet as an enlisted guy.
[00:26:48] Because they just want to have they need you.
[00:26:51] The officers, there's all kinds of officers that want to be seal officers.
[00:26:55] So they have hundreds and hundreds.
[00:26:56] If not probably thousands of people that apply to be seal officers.
[00:27:00] And they you know they take a very small number of them at 30 or 40 a year.
[00:27:05] Topps.
[00:27:06] And within listed there's probably I don't know.
[00:27:08] A thousand a year that that that that show up and go through.
[00:27:11] And so that was the challenging part.
[00:27:13] And for me I actually didn't become an officer until I was already in the seal teams
[00:27:17] for eight years.
[00:27:19] And then and then once I once I did that it was it was a hard program that I got picked
[00:27:23] up for as well.
[00:27:25] But you know coming right out of the Naval Academy is very very hard to get one of those
[00:27:30] billets.
[00:27:31] But like Lave said and actually his sister, Patoon Commander that was in task in the
[00:27:35] freezer was the same way didn't get picked up had to go to the surface fleet and drive
[00:27:40] a ship for a while and then showed up at the seal teams and was he asking.
[00:27:45] We actually went through went through bugs together in the same blood class.
[00:27:47] Oh, okay.
[00:27:48] Yeah.
[00:27:49] And I actually liked it because you guys knew how to do some of the administrative
[00:27:53] stuff that most seal officers did not have any relations.
[00:27:56] Yeah, so that was awesome.
[00:27:58] So that so you say, um, if you're an officer it's harder.
[00:28:05] And they choose just a few guys, right?
[00:28:06] So if you're an officer, I'm not saying there's an officer it's harder, but there's
[00:28:11] there's less billets as Jack which is explained.
[00:28:13] Oh, okay.
[00:28:14] So what's that based on, you know, there's less like I'm going to choose him but not
[00:28:18] you.
[00:28:19] Is that based on the screening process or they based it on.
[00:28:22] Well, so you get out of the different commissioning sources, they've got a certain number
[00:28:26] of billets aside.
[00:28:27] So and then you, it's, it's not luck.
[00:28:30] It's based on your record.
[00:28:31] Oh, it's based on your grades.
[00:28:33] It's cool.
[00:28:34] I mean, you had to have a high GPA, which I did not have.
[00:28:37] And then you had to have a, like, why don't you just rub salt in the woods and go down
[00:28:42] on the line.
[00:28:43] Just try to understand, you know.
[00:28:45] But now, you kind of think the other thing, you, they also based on, uh, PT scores as
[00:28:50] well, so it's physical training scores.
[00:28:52] You go through the seal fitness test.
[00:28:54] And so I mean, I'm going up against guys that are collegiate swimmers and, you know, cross
[00:29:00] country runners and, you know, folks like that who are crushing me on the test, you know,
[00:29:06] and, and putting up ludicrous numbers, whereas, so, so I could pass the test to go, but
[00:29:13] you got to go away and above and beyond that to even be competitive.
[00:29:16] So that's kind of where, you know, where it was difficult.
[00:29:19] The other issue I had was that I had a bit of a conduct record as well.
[00:29:24] I got a lot of trouble.
[00:29:25] I started restriction and, uh, I marks a lot of tours and I had a lot of the merits and,
[00:29:32] uh, I went ahead some upper classmen who told me to do something I didn't like a couple
[00:29:38] times.
[00:29:39] I told them what I thought about it.
[00:29:40] And then I don't know.
[00:29:41] And they didn't work out too good for me.
[00:29:42] I'll drop the maker.
[00:29:43] All part of the learning experience.
[00:29:44] Yeah.
[00:29:45] So, uh, now another thing that obviously came up when, you know, it's a great thing.
[00:29:55] It's been coming up.
[00:29:56] It actually comes up all the time.
[00:29:59] And, you know, being in task and a bruiser, people heard that name and they've heard it,
[00:30:05] you know, obviously around Chris Kyle.
[00:30:09] And I've been asked since the podcast started, you know, can you talk about Chris Kyle
[00:30:14] and the whole time, I knew you were going to be coming on at some point and I've been
[00:30:18] waiting to talk about Chris until you were here.
[00:30:25] And, you know, people say, did you work with Chris?
[00:30:27] Did you know Chris?
[00:30:29] And the answer is yes.
[00:30:34] We absolutely worked with Chris and wanted to take just an opportunity to talk about Chris
[00:30:43] and one of the things that I would like to try and do is talk about Chris, the Chris
[00:30:53] that we knew.
[00:30:54] Right?
[00:30:55] And the Chris that lay for nine new, the Chris that the guys that are actually served
[00:30:59] with Chris knew, who is a little bit different than the Chris Kyle that's often portrayed
[00:31:06] in the movies.
[00:31:07] For sure, I'd be happy to talk about that.
[00:31:10] And it's funny because people want people to tell Chris Kyle's doors, you know, and
[00:31:16] he really is the legend, which I think a lot of people don't realize it was a name that
[00:31:20] was given to him.
[00:31:21] You know, that was his nickname was the legend, it was given to him and his previous
[00:31:26] 14 before we worked together.
[00:31:28] And I remember our met Chris at that time because I was with SILTEEN 5 and I deployed at the
[00:31:32] same time under the EASY of SILTEEN 3.
[00:31:35] And so we were there and I remember meeting him in the talk and just come back from Felugia
[00:31:38] and doing some great sniper work there and working with a bunch of our mutual friends.
[00:31:45] And so his return was in the Pacific theater at the time and he got a chance to go forward
[00:31:51] and be one of the few guys from the guys that were going to the Pacific that were selected
[00:31:55] to go to Iraq and actually be in the fight.
[00:31:59] And so guys were pissed.
[00:32:02] They were pissed that they were sitting there and the Pacific theater trained in some local
[00:32:07] national forces out of shoot around on paper and Chris was over there shooting bad guys
[00:32:11] in Iraq.
[00:32:12] And so they made this nickname the legend which was, and it was very much ingest.
[00:32:18] So it's funny that as he continued to go on and do these great things and now he's just
[00:32:24] this incredible larger life theater he really is the legend.
[00:32:27] And it's really, so when I hear stories or watch movies or hear people talk about it
[00:32:32] away it's, it is.
[00:32:33] It's not the Chris Calde we knew.
[00:32:35] It's a superhuman.
[00:32:37] It's like a comic book hero and look at the reality is I think you know, I haven't worked
[00:32:43] really close with Chris and he was our lead sniper and point man just so people understand
[00:32:48] that in Charlie Baton I was the Baton commander of Charlie Baton which meant that on every
[00:32:53] patrol that we went on he was walking about eight or ten feet in front of me and that
[00:32:59] we talked all the time.
[00:33:02] We were in working about where we were going in, working together and what areas we wanted
[00:33:08] to take down, what buildings we wanted to utilize.
[00:33:12] And he was a guy that really drove a lot of our operations and so I knew Chris well.
[00:33:18] He was one of the three guys we had three guys that were on their third built-in and we
[00:33:26] called them the Triumvirate and these two other guys, she'll act of duty, I can't name
[00:33:30] them, they're outstanding guys but these guys have been together for three built-in three
[00:33:34] rotations through to the police, the middle east to Iraq and so we called them the Triumvirate
[00:33:41] you know which is the Triumvirate is a term from the Roman era where you had a group of
[00:33:46] three people who share a position of power to authority and these guys really drove they
[00:33:50] really they brought up the new guys, they trained new guys and got our opportunity really
[00:33:56] where they needed to be, we're kind of the heart and soul of the Baton and Chris was you
[00:33:59] know the real Chris that we knew and worked with was hilarious number one and you know
[00:34:05] that doesn't come across when you when you to a lot of people that he was a guy who's
[00:34:09] just funny is hell always could crack a joke sometimes when he shouldn't have been
[00:34:14] cracking the joke yeah but he was a guy that you know I think it almost does him
[00:34:21] a disservice to pain him in a way that was this superhuman because the reason he was so
[00:34:27] successful at what he did is that he worked really hard at that and was very focused
[00:34:31] on it to really perfect his craft and he you know not only that he he delved into the
[00:34:36] planning so we'd sit over a map and talk about where we wanted to go look at different
[00:34:41] buildings and say and then we go on a reconnaissance patrol which we had to run up through
[00:34:48] approval to the chain of command for certain types of operations but Jaco is our
[00:34:53] task in a manner approved our our reconnaissance patrols and meaning meaning that I could
[00:35:00] approve them so they didn't really have to go up that that chain of command so it's pretty
[00:35:03] easy to get them approved for people that are listening didn't quite catch that yeah
[00:35:07] so yeah so we just said hey Jaco we want to do this and he'd be like great so we go
[00:35:13] we'd go out and we patrol through some really bad areas and we'd hit like a dozen
[00:35:18] different buildings going buildings here check out observation points there see what kind of
[00:35:23] you know roads we could see in access so we could see so we figure out what gave us
[00:35:27] the best advantage and then Chris would figure out where he wanted to be and he'd put
[00:35:31] himself in that position and so he'd get I'm looking down this window I'm looking through
[00:35:35] this loophole and the roof wall and you know he so he said himself up success which is awesome
[00:35:42] which is so up maybe so for instance if the angle that he would pick from a building
[00:35:46] would be looking down the long access of a road where he could see four five hundred meters
[00:35:52] worth of possible enemy targets whereas another angle looking down a shorter road maybe you can
[00:35:58] only see 80 meters and he got a much smaller area to cover so he'd pick these areas that he thought
[00:36:04] would be the most prevalent most no the highest number of targets possible of course and
[00:36:10] and but that was obviously that was how we made the that's how we made the that's how we were
[00:36:16] so successful and that's how we were able to to prevent attacks on enemy forces and are on
[00:36:21] enemy attacks on friendly forces rather and and so you know not only that but when we go into
[00:36:27] these these positions you know Chris would be he knew after the sun came up first call the
[00:36:32] prayer goes down and the kind of early dawn pre-done hours and then the sun comes up and the
[00:36:36] city comes alive and enemy fighters are moving around and you know he'd be on the on the weapon
[00:36:41] when he knew that was looking down his cypresscope when he knew it was it was that was the highest
[00:36:48] in the early morning you know as the morning comes around you know that 80 10 o'clock hour
[00:36:53] that's when we knew we were going to get contacted and you know late afternoon was kind of the same thing
[00:36:57] he'd be honest is gun and of course he had to rotate out at some point he could so you're only
[00:37:03] humanly possible this day when you're gun for so long but when he was honest gun he looked down
[00:37:10] the scope of the weapon I mean he was very disciplined about that and I remember hearing some
[00:37:14] other guys being like oh man you know I only have I only have eight or ten kilos and Chris you know
[00:37:20] how has he got 85 now you know some some you know so at some point through into our deployment
[00:37:25] before it was completed and you know the route as you can see some of those guys were
[00:37:31] you know we had seven other cypressine on both and they did a lot of great work and they did
[00:37:34] they had some impact and certainly did great stuff but a couple of those guys I'd see that
[00:37:40] didn't have the same discipline Chris that they would they'd look down their weapon and you
[00:37:43] 30 45 minutes into it they're not as you know they're not seeing anything they haven't
[00:37:47] firing his shots and Xenoe they're kind of having a conversation with their buddy next to him
[00:37:52] next to you know they're sitting back from there they're rifle next to you know they're just
[00:37:55] kind of looking through binos and I remember watching Chris and just he's just looking through
[00:37:59] his scope for two straight hours and without coming off of it and it was you know that was that
[00:38:04] enabled him to be successful and that discipline really paid off and certainly certainly he was
[00:38:10] able to rack up the the damage to enemy fighters no doubt about it I know whenever I roll out to
[00:38:16] visit you guys and it over watch position see everyone and I would always notice Chris will always
[00:38:21] be on a gun but I'd never saw him not on his gun of course obviously like he said he's
[00:38:25] human and he'd take breaks but I I'd I'd notice that even on the planet you know I'd just say
[00:38:30] oh Chris is on his gun except for when you ruled in the cop falcon and he was crashed out
[00:38:34] sleeping with the rest of you guys so that was actually kind of a funny episode where we went in on boats
[00:38:41] and we snuck into we snuck down this is some Chris wrote about in American sniper we we went
[00:38:49] out on the the Marine Corps boat unit that was there was a great group of guys to the awesome
[00:38:54] guys and they they took his very quietly down at the river canal that kind of comes off of the
[00:39:00] river we were able to to launch off on the river bank very quietly foot patrol into the city
[00:39:06] and and get in an area that other people couldn't get into a super dangerous bad guys had no idea
[00:39:11] where they're and we were able to take advantage of that smoke who smoke a guy are to on the way in
[00:39:16] and then and then moving and take down the buildings that were gonna be this combat outpost as
[00:39:21] the army they were falling this giant mine clearance element coming down the roads digging
[00:39:27] ideas. Jockel was riding in in a Bradley fighting vehicle brave in the the some of the
[00:39:33] most dangerous roads in the world the time you know coming in with the the army battalion staff there
[00:39:38] and as our command and control and so we were already in we'd been there for I don't know
[00:39:42] three or four hours at that point maybe maybe longer and so we shot a couple guys and we're you know
[00:39:48] we're a couple enemy fighters and and we still had guys in security position certainly in guys
[00:39:52] on guns but at that point it was the I.D. Clarence team was like right underneath us I remember
[00:39:57] actually looking over the side of the building and seeing this giant buffalo is huge truck armored
[00:40:05] vehicle with a arm on it digging out of the street and I know you were in a vehicle kind of coming
[00:40:10] and just behind that a few few vehicles up the road you were maybe a few blocks away at that
[00:40:16] point and I'm looking down I'm like that's like 30 feet below me like directly below me right now
[00:40:23] so if this thing activates an ID that explodes like I'm gonna take it right to face probably
[00:40:28] I'd get up down and stop looking at what they're doing so we were just kind of hooked her down
[00:40:32] and when Jockel came in there it was it was fun because the the in particular the army
[00:40:37] operations officer for the battalion was a great guy and the battalion was awesome this was
[00:40:42] task force banded a bunch of tankers great guys we loved them they came in and and I remember
[00:40:48] you come to the rooftop with a major and he comes up there and he's expecting just bristling weapons
[00:40:53] everywhere at all seals on their guns and I'm looking over as the major stand in there and kind of
[00:40:58] looking around and there's a couple guys on there guns and there's some guys on machine guns
[00:41:02] and people watching this day security was definitely security was set of course but I'm looking
[00:41:07] over and Chris and our leading petty officer had just hammered down these like chef boy R.D.
[00:41:15] didn't want to eat MR.E. so they just crushed these like he had like three or four empty containers
[00:41:20] of like chef boy R.D. meatballs like who pleats like yeah it was just like like spilled all
[00:41:26] over as uniform and he's just like totally racked out like completely asleep
[00:41:31] slumber himself snoring and the major is like is this man who did it? it's funny because we
[00:41:40] would get the preparation for those big operations you'd be working so much doing the preparation
[00:41:45] of the coordination and the planning that you wouldn't even stop for a day and a half or two days
[00:41:50] and when you finally get in the field you're tired exactly and we we had to sleep and that's
[00:41:55] when we had to sleep when we knew we'd kill some bad guys we weren't going to get attacked or
[00:41:59] we less likely to get attacked in the next few hours while it was still dark we had to get sleep
[00:42:04] then and so there was a real reason for that because once the sun came up we were going to get hammered
[00:42:08] so we all had to be awake we all had to be ready to go so we had to get that kind of sleep when we
[00:42:12] could and that was you know that particular operation I remember in particular Chris
[00:42:19] he was he just kind of had a good sense about things we were arguing over a bill I was
[00:42:23] standing on the rooftop and I was okay there's a bill meet there's a big bill into the south
[00:42:27] that would give us a good vantage point let's move down what do you think about that
[00:42:31] building over there I'm talking it over with him and with our potential chief Tony and Chris was like
[00:42:35] you know what I like this building to the east let's go to the forest story yeah he's pulling a
[00:42:40] forest story and I was like I don't know man that building the south looks pretty good he's like
[00:42:44] I think this building the east is where we want to go and we talked about it for a little bit
[00:42:50] and I was like okay Roger that let's go to the east so we moved we moved about 350 yards down
[00:42:55] the street to this big forest story apartment building and it was it was absolutely the right call
[00:43:00] I mean and we not done that we would have because it was I think we had what do we have like 22
[00:43:06] enemy confirmed kill from that over the 40 years or I really was right but a couple of dozen you
[00:43:11] know probable kill so it was it was it was a great advantage point and we were looking right
[00:43:16] down a long access road that was able to prevent a whole bunch of attacks on the U.S. soldiers
[00:43:23] that were building that combat outpost and it was and they were under fire the whole time and as soon
[00:43:27] as the sun came up I know you were sitting in the camp with those mortars came in and you know and
[00:43:32] then lo and behold so this the mortars explode in the camp and we you know it's easy to just say
[00:43:38] oh mortars but the reality was a gigantic explosion goes off and we were 350 yards away
[00:43:46] frag was raining down fragmentation from that explosion was raining down on us from 350 yards away
[00:43:52] so it was massive 120 millimeter mortars coming in you know enforce a kill the soldier will
[00:43:59] go to a couple others and and that very I mean within about half an hour of that Chris
[00:44:04] smoked two guys out of like four that were low in a mortar tube in the back of a truck so
[00:44:10] and when when that's that's who Chris was and that's that's the impact that he had and yet a
[00:44:15] good sense about what what where to go and what to do and he was excellent at it and he was just
[00:44:20] it was just awesome to work with him he was so much fun to be around and always quick with a joke
[00:44:26] and that's the real Chris got when it you know to just go back to the fact that he you know after
[00:44:35] you know I was on I was in the combat outpost we take these mortars soldier gets killed I remember
[00:44:39] there and another soldier got wounded I think and a rack he got wounded as well and it's it's a nightmare
[00:44:45] right these guys are bleeding out it's it's a nightmare and the thing and we talked about this
[00:44:52] on the last podcast of how helpless you feel against mortars it's the worst and talking about
[00:44:57] it because they came from maybe they could have come from three four five kilometers away
[00:45:01] and Eugene sledge talks about it and we talked about World War One and how bad it is and so you
[00:45:05] have this combat outpost and all the guys are on their their now horrified right your scared
[00:45:12] when is this next random bomb gonna just blow up we cannot be safe if you can imagine
[00:45:19] the when I got word from you hey Chris just killed two guys with a mortar tube and I went to
[00:45:24] you know the company commander and the brigade commander was down there as well and said hey sir
[00:45:29] one of our snipers just killed two guys with a mortar tube loaded into a truck
[00:45:34] you couldn't do anything in the world better for them at that time nothing better in the world
[00:45:40] to walk into those guys and say hey you just lost a soldier to mortar we got him
[00:45:46] and that was one of those things that just helped build our relationship with the conventional
[00:45:51] unit so much and you know what we needed the relationship because you could sit here and tell
[00:45:56] stories all day long about what they did and returned for us which was also just incredibly
[00:46:03] brave and that we very same day we were calling QRF and I know you were you were trying to move
[00:46:09] vehicles out of the way so we could get the tanks out there to our guys that were pinned down
[00:46:13] and needed help and those tankers came out every time the soldier for amazing you know when
[00:46:18] they when Chris Kyle got those two guys hot like how far away is that typically
[00:46:24] or is there even a little before right that's you have to do with people talking about these
[00:46:28] sniper elements well first of all they have to understand that it's in Ramadi in downtown Ramadi in 2006
[00:46:34] this was this was like Stalin grad I mean it was just rubble pile buildings just we had this was
[00:46:41] alkydden Iraq battle space I mean this is the precursor of ISIS and it's the same people and they
[00:46:47] there were several thousand of these guys that controlled the city and it was it was just a nasty
[00:46:53] place so we didn't go out in these little two and four man teams it was we were going in with
[00:46:58] 15 20 25 30 guys you know sometimes we have to manage just 40 guys you're plus up with army and
[00:47:05] Marines that went in with us and we always had Iraqi soldiers what we didn't count them as part of
[00:47:09] our this part of our these are the guys going to help build this out if you think you go down so we
[00:47:14] had to have a big enough element that could get prevent us from being overrun and you know if Chris
[00:47:18] were here today I think he'd tell you man is you know the the only reason he was able to do what he
[00:47:23] what he could was because there was a huge team of guys supporting and those the guys
[00:47:27] care and the machine guns in that were helping beat back attacks and guess what when you're attacked
[00:47:33] by machine guns and and rockets from RPGs and and you got a dozen enemy fighters maneuvering on you
[00:47:39] you're not breaking contact with a bolt action sample shot snagged you got to have those
[00:47:45] machine gunners that are going to beat back those attacks and that's what those guys did so you know
[00:47:48] without without without that whole team we we were carrying our own shoulder fire rock it's our
[00:47:53] leading peddaus or it was always a guy that would carry the carry that big heavy 84 millimeter
[00:47:59] recoil is rifle over shoulder this big bazooka looking thing and and the heavy rounds for that
[00:48:04] it was it was we had to have that kind of firepower with us so that was critical for all that we did
[00:48:09] but most of the shots were pretty close I mean you're talking urban combat is you know there
[00:48:15] wasn't a lot of real long range shooting ever once a while they I think I think Chris and Tony
[00:48:21] he had a couple guys from 1500 yards or so out in a rule there I went on that particular operation
[00:48:26] but but there was but most of the stuff in the urban environment of downtown I mean we we hit
[00:48:32] guys from as close as I remember a couple of times were one time a particular me and markly
[00:48:39] and and Chris were sitting in a room and we look over and there's some guys like there's
[00:48:46] literally some moves like some enemy fighters with machine guns looking around the corner and
[00:48:52] they're like they're like 25 yards from this like like you know maybe 30 yards from this
[00:48:58] and they're they're looking down the street they knew we were in there somewhere but they got the
[00:49:01] building wrong so so you're you're talking a 30 yard shot there with that that's where guys coming
[00:49:07] on you know I think Chris ditched his right is his sniper rifle grab his info and shot those
[00:49:12] guys through the window and then you know some of those shots are making a lot of them I think
[00:49:17] the average was I would say probably anywhere from 100 to 300 300 and that's you call that
[00:49:25] pretty close like it's pretty close for 100 for sure for sure for sure these guys in their
[00:49:30] train to make you know 1,200,000 yards shots and so it's it's just a very different type of
[00:49:35] environment and that urban combat is it's personal you can hear those guys yelling at you you can
[00:49:40] hear me yelling the jahadi regret we're yelling back at them you know there's there's a lot of
[00:49:45] profanity going back and forth and but it's you know some of the stuff was anger-nade range
[00:49:50] definitely dang and call them what moves that we call them moves moves that's that's that's
[00:49:56] that was what the quality fighters that we so they call themselves Mujahideen which is
[00:50:02] God so in gauge in jihad that's their name for themselves and so we shot that to move
[00:50:08] and we actually got told that we weren't supposed to call the mouche. Yeah it's interesting
[00:50:14] you can take a real name short knit and it becomes derogatory. Yeah it was the interesting thing
[00:50:20] was we were told that it was derogatory and inappropriate to say mouche and that it was disrespected
[00:50:28] to the local populace and when we talked to the local populace you know what the local populace
[00:50:32] called the mouche. That's what they called them. It was funny we had the cultural experts
[00:50:39] telling us when we were actually we were talking to locals and understanding what was happening
[00:50:44] more than anybody else at that particular time. Yeah maybe it was like offensive to them though you
[00:50:49] know the actual mouche. Maybe they were offended. We were not concerned about offended mouche.
[00:50:55] Yeah and you're all shooting them you're shooting them but the mouche that's too much
[00:50:58] another channel with that big culture warriors who just don't get it. Yeah it was a local
[00:51:04] people were praying for us to go killed them. Yeah killed the bad guys and then free them from this
[00:51:10] evil terrorist organization that is imposing this horrific just brutal rain of terror on them and
[00:51:17] so I mean it's exactly the same thing you see ISIS doing today and we saw it over and over again
[00:51:21] in the city where you you know you go into a house and there's a family there and they're trying
[00:51:25] to just not to get killed in the crossfire and they want your help and they're happy you're there.
[00:51:32] You know you mentioned Mark and Mark was in the movie Mark Lee he was in the movie
[00:51:38] American Snipers well and again there's something that comes across in the public image or
[00:51:47] the image that gets created through Hollywood and through books and through media and whatever else
[00:51:51] and they really in the movie American Snipers they really miss the mark with Mark I mean they
[00:51:58] really they really missed the mark no doubt made him into kind of a weak looking guy that didn't
[00:52:06] believe anyone he was doing which was obviously couldn't be further from the truth. Well to that
[00:52:13] point I would we get asked all the time like you know tell us about American Snipers was that accurate
[00:52:17] you know I think I think it's important to say that first of all I'm I'm very glad that Chris
[00:52:24] Kyle stores out there and I think that to get people to recognize what Chris did and you know the
[00:52:31] impact that he had and the fact that his his story is representative of so many hundreds of
[00:52:39] thousands of U.S. soldiers and Marines and sailors who at airmen that have deployed multiple times
[00:52:45] what their families go through and I think that's a great thing but it's it is a Hollywood movie
[00:52:51] and and so you know the the scenes in Iraq were not a reflection of the reality that we knew
[00:52:59] and in particular that depiction of Mark that's what disturbed those of us that serve closely
[00:53:05] with Chris and close to with Mark were most disturbed by that and it was just the way that
[00:53:08] Mark was portrayed you know Hollywood has they hate the Iraq war so they've got to they got to have
[00:53:16] someone in there that doesn't like the Iraq war and so they they tried they betrayed Mark in a way
[00:53:22] that you know he made some despair they got they got him saying I don't even remember exactly what
[00:53:26] what he says but he says some lines about he doesn't believe in what he's doing and that is just
[00:53:31] utter and complete horseshit I mean there's no Markly believed in that mission I mean he was
[00:53:39] he was an extraordinary warrior and you know other when other people were out to kill bad guys
[00:53:46] and try to you know do a bunch of operations I mean Mark truly believe we were there to help the
[00:53:51] Iraqi people we need to free these people from this brutal rain of terror and I think he had a
[00:53:56] he had strategic insight that I'm not even sure I had I mean I read back like Mark's last letter home
[00:54:03] and he talks about being involved in a great conflict and a great struggle you know he had
[00:54:09] like the one we're involved and and it's I think that was very reflective of that this is this
[00:54:16] seeing that you know the enemy that we're fighting here this this type of G-hode you know this G-hodeism
[00:54:22] with this this strain of Islam that exports G-hode across the world and and once it goes out and terrorize
[00:54:27] and brutalize people like this is a great struggle this is going to be a generational struggle this is
[00:54:32] going to go on for a long time it's certainly transcends Iraq and I think he had he really
[00:54:37] seemed to sense that in a way that was pretty phenomenal in the movie is they they make him out to be
[00:54:43] this sad guy that's all serious and again they completely miss the mark just like they they portray
[00:54:50] Chris to be this ultra serious guy Mark was hilarious, grigarius, another guy that was joking
[00:54:59] all the time mostly at inappropriate times and had that you know he would just he would
[00:55:06] light up a room when he'd come in to a room because he was just on fire and to portray him as this
[00:55:12] guy that's all down in the dumps and depressed it was just it was horrible to see that it was it was just
[00:55:19] so opposite of the real mark I mean this is the brooding guy and and the head of miss this kind of
[00:55:25] like pencil neck kind of you know is the quote patent couldn't fight his way out of a piss soaked paper back
[00:55:32] I mean Mark was a badass guy he had massive arms he carried his his big heavy
[00:55:38] Mark 48 machine gun that weighs like 25 27 pounds fully loaded with all the gadgets on it
[00:55:44] it would no sling he cared his shoulder like it was a little him for rifle you know that weighs
[00:55:50] seven pounds I'm gonna air you know with all that's it's gadgetry he's he was a just an awesome
[00:55:56] warrior and and yeah that's side of him that was just hilarious it was so many stories of him
[00:56:01] cracking jokes and just keeping everybody laughing and we kind of talked to if you if you're listening
[00:56:06] to podcast and you haven't seen a series called on the history channel called Live To Tell it is a
[00:56:12] fantastic series that actually a former seal friend of ours Raymond doze produced he did he produce
[00:56:20] he was in Ramadi actually and he relieved us in Ramadi when we got done with our deployment
[00:56:25] Ramadi he's one of the guys that came in the next task unit that came over and took our place
[00:56:30] and he worked out a camp carigador that's right we just spoke about so they made an episode one of
[00:56:37] the episodes is about chargoth patoon mark lee and we we got to tell some of the stories there but
[00:56:44] you know they're you don't have that you can't tell every story that you want to tell you want to tell
[00:56:49] every story every little member you have of these guys you know one that always sticks out my mind
[00:56:54] because he joined your patoon late and he came from another patoon came into your patoon after work
[00:57:02] up and one of the first trips we did with him was to was to Vegas and we went up there to work
[00:57:07] yeah what's there to tell us that was there for us now we've been working now as any of our
[00:57:12] soon dog will trip that whole boom dog will we would work from probably about noon until
[00:57:18] let's call it six or seven o'clock at night and then everyone would go gambling and drinking
[00:57:24] and partying until 10 o'clock the next morning and then gamble it was just one of those trips
[00:57:31] but but we we we we were we were getting after it and that's another thing about being a young
[00:57:36] seal you don't have you don't have you don't you don't owe any money right so you just when I
[00:57:43] remember when I was a young seal I was like the richest guy in the world because you know you go
[00:57:48] from being a civilian that's 18 years old making no money and all of a sudden you're getting a paycheck
[00:57:53] and then you get the seal teams you're getting dive pay and jump pay and demolish and pay and
[00:57:57] you're like the richest guy in the world you're like a rock star and that's kind of the mode
[00:58:01] that Mark was there night I would we were in Vegas was he was big time in it to get after it
[00:58:07] I remember you on that trail I'm gonna you coming in and say HDH are you with
[00:58:12] I was like I was like what is HDH like are you with you just after I said Roger that I'm in
[00:58:20] I did that with a bunch of guys HDH who's in and I went and I'm guys like I'm in I'm in no one
[00:58:26] even knew what I was talking about and then I at whatever we got together that night I'm like
[00:58:30] all right HDH who's with me and the everyone joined up I said it's $100 hands we're going to
[00:58:34] blackjack table we're all gonna play $3100 hands which to those guys and our Navy paychecks it was a big
[00:58:42] deal yeah so we did it but the plan gambling with Mark was was insane because he was so
[00:58:51] so like hostile and yet at the same time fun and I remember I came walking down to the casino
[00:58:57] and he's like hey sir and I look over and he's across the casino and he's at the blackjack
[00:59:04] table and he goes he must have been on a wooden street he goes where are the new Cadillacs coming out
[00:59:12] and that was just so so him just to be fired up like that was just awesome awesome he was just one of
[00:59:18] those guys and you know not only was he hilarious to be around you know a big strap and good
[00:59:24] looking dude he he he just was very comfortable in his skin as well you know and he he he
[00:59:29] uh he was absolutely in love with it as wife you know my I was in that in in Liffa tell and
[00:59:36] he she had given him this these uh I mean he's these little pajama pants I mean this is like
[00:59:44] and he he would wear them around the camp yeah these pajama pants and I was like bro
[00:59:49] what are you wearing pajama pants right now and he went yeah I was like why are you wearing I mean
[00:59:56] he's a new guy in a potato joke don't let jocos you I was like do you want to get you ask it like
[01:00:01] why are you wearing a pajama and she's like they're comfortable my again doing like a
[01:00:06] I mean he's like he just did like whatever you know like a muggares so that was just the way Mark was
[01:00:11] and you know he just was uh I remember a particular you know not he was he was a strong Christian guy
[01:00:17] definitely uh he'd gone to seminary for about a year or so I think you know to study to be a
[01:00:23] preacher and decided you know what instead of being a preacher I want to be in the sea
[01:00:28] of things but his Christian faith was certainly always a big big piece of that and I remember
[01:00:33] some of the most random things we were talking about uh I don't even remember how it came up
[01:00:38] but if you remember the old 1980 song of the warrior which is like cheeseball 1980s
[01:00:46] you know and we got an argument about who sang the warrior and Mark was like it's pat been a
[01:00:52] tar and I'm embarrassed to say that I said no it's patty smith because I had this guy
[01:01:00] you don't do it myth that right this gigantic collection of you know it he saw you
[01:01:03] a vaginal my uh on my iTunes and and and so we argued about it we had some weight I
[01:01:09] remember where the wager was but it was uh in fact patty smith that was right right on
[01:01:15] and I think that you know you talked about his faith and and we've talked about on this
[01:01:21] on this podcast before the when you get somebody that is is heroic that oftentimes
[01:01:33] they have a certain sense of the word that you just use was comfort and you could see
[01:01:42] that with Mark that he was comfortable in the fact that he might have to make the ultimate
[01:01:49] sacrifice and I remember one of the one of the things I'll never forget about Mark is
[01:01:56] as you guys would be rolling out on an operation and you would line up the vehicles right
[01:02:03] in front of the chow hall on our on our little base shark base and you know if you guys were
[01:02:09] going out I would go out there to see you guys off and just to help her by understand like we're
[01:02:14] rolling out on an operation into some of the most dangerous enemy territory anywhere and
[01:02:20] and people would come out with jocco and our from our task and shake shake folks hands up
[01:02:26] because you knew that it could very easily happen to not everybody's coming back from from that
[01:02:30] off and you always it was always reassuring to see jocco out there talking to people shaking
[01:02:36] people's hands and that was and we're going out particularly in our operation like that were
[01:02:41] IEDs are calling causing catastrophic damage and killing soldiers and Marines every single day
[01:02:48] yeah and those IEDs at this point were generally victim activated IEDs which means that
[01:02:57] the person that's going to get blown up is what activates the IED so they have some kind of
[01:03:01] a pressure plate or a crunch wire or something that a humvy runs over and causes the IED to detonate
[01:03:07] that was sort of the the premier mode that the enemy was in at this point which meant that if you were
[01:03:15] in the first vehicle you were most likely to hit that IED and I remember I'd you know one of
[01:03:22] those nights came out and looked up and looked up at Mark and and I said hey are you feeling
[01:03:29] lucky tonight and he said a big smile on his face and he said that the thing that one of the
[01:03:33] other things he had said in Vegas besides you know winner the new Cadillacs and one of the other
[01:03:38] things that he'd get everybody saying is when the dealer would bust you know he'd say
[01:03:42] everybody's a winner everybody's a winner as I looked up at him and he anyway said everybody's a winner
[01:03:49] and then it was another time I went out there and you know I said I said you read rock and roll
[01:03:53] tonight and he stood there in the turret and like like a movie you know there's have those
[01:03:59] cheesy salute scenes in a movie where the the guy is salute's the officer he like stood at
[01:04:05] attention to his turret and just cracked me a super crisp salute and I probably like flipped them off
[01:04:10] or you know which is highly unusual for a seal to do that yeah yeah but you could see man he just
[01:04:18] had that confidence in that comfort in who he was in what he stood for and he was ready for
[01:04:28] he was ready for anything including including the ultimate he was a phenomenal guy absolutely
[01:04:36] and just an honor an honor reserve wouldn't like that.
[01:04:44] I think the last guy that they kind of represent in in the movie American Cypher is
[01:04:56] Biggles
[01:04:58] Ryan Job nicknamed Biggles who if you're in if you're in the military if you're in the
[01:05:06] seal teams and you use it heavy weapon the weapon the nickname for that weapon is a big
[01:05:12] pain in the ass weapon of carry and the nickname for it's a pig and you're actually a pig
[01:05:17] gunner if you're if you carry that big mark 48 used to be in M60 now it's a mark 48 they call
[01:05:23] that weapon a pig because you know you gotta carry that pig and now you're a pig gunner
[01:05:26] and his nickname was Biggles and he nicknamed his weapon Piggles.
[01:05:30] Piggles.
[01:05:34] Just to think about the way they represented Ryan and I don't remember all that well again they
[01:05:42] they add a special screening of Americans sniper forest down here in Cornado that's when I saw
[01:05:45] I saw it one time and so I don't fully remember how they I definitely remembered how they
[01:05:52] represented Chris Mark obviously but you know Ryan they didn't seem as significant of as
[01:05:58] a role so that it was a little bit they didn't make such a production out of Biggles but obviously
[01:06:06] in doing that they again shortchanged just a fabulous character and an incredibly
[01:06:15] funny and lively and warm human being that was an absolute just an absolute treasure of a person
[01:06:35] and so no one's gonna you know if you if all you do is see the movie of Americans sniper
[01:06:39] and even if even if we wrote an entire book about Biggles you wouldn't be able to get across
[01:06:49] what any of these guys really brought to life yeah he was he was a phenomenal guy and
[01:06:57] I actually you know some some people some people talk to me people said to me before you know
[01:07:07] hey he was a greatest person you've ever met some phenomenal people in my life you know and I
[01:07:11] I think the my immediate reaction that is Brian Jo Brian Jo of the greatest person I mean he just was
[01:07:18] he was and it was actually what's crazy is when I when I first met Ryan and when he he joined
[01:07:24] our cartoon he got the nickname Biggles because he didn't exactly have the rippling six back
[01:07:30] he was just a toughest nails guy that just would not quit no matter what was determined to be a
[01:07:35] seal but struggle with the run struggle with the swams and got the what we call the full benefit
[01:07:41] in our seal train but he was he was known credible athlete or physical specimen especially when
[01:07:50] he showed up in Charlie Pettin and T.U. Bruser you know doubt he was not ready for the teams at that
[01:07:55] point when Biggles got the Charlie Pettin yeah we rolled the right out to the deserts of Southern
[01:08:01] California and got what we call land warfare training on and that was that's really man gap that's
[01:08:08] you know we talk about seal training and people think it's all about carrying logs around and boats
[01:08:13] and all that stuff that you see from that's really just our initial screening process what we call
[01:08:18] buds basically on our demolition seal training going out and working together in a workup is really
[01:08:23] where the training to be a seal to be a teammate to work as a as a unit happens and so our whole
[01:08:31] task in it from jacco all the way down to our lowest common denominator the most junior rank
[01:08:37] you man who happened to be Ryan J. We went out to we went out to Southern California deserts and just
[01:08:43] and we shot weapons we learned how to shoot we communicate and it is everything is difficult it is
[01:08:49] you're going you're dragging down men you know her killed in for training purposes over rocks
[01:08:56] and through cactus and you're running and gun in and it's hot and it's tiring and exhausting
[01:09:02] and it's awesome and it's the training we're same training that's kept seals alive on the battlefield
[01:09:07] and unable to do things for for a long time and seals have been training there since the
[01:09:12] Vietnam that particular place where we go and try in there and it's awesome I love it out there and
[01:09:17] when Biggles got out there he was he was struggling he was coming off of about I'd say 30 to 45
[01:09:26] days of leaving he's he living he was and he'd gone you know after buds where he'd had to make it
[01:09:31] to try and he had to be in shape and now you know one of the things some people struggle with when
[01:09:35] they get done with that training is now it's up to them now it's up to them to be in shape
[01:09:41] self this and some people have that self this man and some people don't and I certainly want
[01:09:47] to peak physical condition after that I I struggled with that but Biggles took that to a new level
[01:09:54] and you know he came out there all the summer hand in him 25 pound mark 48 machin gun
[01:10:00] which he named Biggles this yaku said and and he's got to carry this thing and carry the six to
[01:10:06] 800 rounds on him and move through the jagged rocks and sand and desert in 115 degree heat
[01:10:14] and and he was struggling he was struggling anyone even in a greatest of shape that's challenging
[01:10:19] but Ryan was really struggling to keep up on that and so I remember having some very he was in my
[01:10:25] squad and so I was witnessing this I was watching this and we pulled him aside and said hey
[01:10:31] listen if you want to be here you better aren't you you got a hard nut the standard is here
[01:10:39] you know the standard is way up here and you're here you're way lower than that standard so
[01:10:44] we had to we had to push him to get there and I remember some stern counseling sessions
[01:10:49] we assigned one of the guys from the the triumphant I mentioned before was one of the guys on
[01:10:53] his therapist tone great dude our most experienced machine gunner and we assigned we assigned him
[01:11:01] to to be a mentor to to big goals and train with him and so every morning we would
[01:11:07] PT work go for wrongs and we so when got other guys were resting Ryan's goal he's got to go out
[01:11:13] for run he's cranking out pull ups he's he's training and working and you know it was I didn't know
[01:11:18] how was going to go then he had a long way to go to get to where he needed to be to be physically
[01:11:23] able to keep up and not track down the rest of the guys and I don't think I've ever seen a guy
[01:11:30] make that kind of a transformation dude and there's an incredible transfer man Ryan must have looked
[01:11:34] himself in the mirror and said this is what I want to do I am going to turn this around completely
[01:11:39] and he became what we called big goals 2000 which is the new model and I mean he by the time we
[01:11:46] deployed you know six months eight months after that that that workup he was born again hard he was born
[01:11:52] again hard and he he was a he never fell behind anything and he always kept up with everybody
[01:12:01] and carried not only his way but sometimes others who were struggling and he would help them through
[01:12:06] and it was it was funny a couple of stories about him we were at at Nylon he's in the weight room
[01:12:13] and you know one of the things about bud you're doing pull ups and you know I know jocca when
[01:12:17] his twitter fetal is as the pictures of like ripped off calisers from dude pull ups or dead
[01:12:22] lifts you know with the with the barbell and that's just part of bud to me you tear up your hands
[01:12:27] on the ropes and all the oak horse and everything you're doing and so we're in the gym
[01:12:34] at out in our land warfare training facility and he's got these like the fingerless like
[01:12:40] weight lifting gloves on like you see in like gold's gym and I'm like not allowed I don't
[01:12:48] like seriously I was like big let's come here why do you have gloves on he's like well I'm just
[01:12:54] trying to protect my head you like getting some actually I was like no no you need a hard
[01:12:59] hands up man no gloves and he was he I was like Roger that no gloves and he took that to such an
[01:13:05] extreme on our operations we always work offs our operations because you're having a
[01:13:10] smash through a window or wrestle down a prisoner and grab a hot barrel of a hot barrel of a
[01:13:17] a smoking red you know red glowing red hot machine gun he was a machine gun or so he had to deal
[01:13:22] with that stuff so we were we're married we were in the cancels gloves are similar to to protect
[01:13:27] our hands from that and and I remember on patrol and and Iraq looking at me like no gloves on
[01:13:33] he took that to such an extreme is like I am gonna be a hard dude and I'm gonna roll out with
[01:13:39] with no gloves I want to carry this machine and I was like hey man where you go they're like hey where
[01:13:43] you go I'm good I'm good and I don't know if it was not smart not smart but hard but tough and
[01:13:50] he was unbelievably tough and you know after Ryan got wounded and people that know the story of
[01:13:56] Ryan he got hit in the face so it would be sniper round on the same day that Mark Lee was killed
[01:14:00] August 2nd 2006 and we thought he was we thought he was a dead man you know when when when he got hit
[01:14:07] the wound just looked so horrific I just didn't think anybody could survive that and yet he did
[01:14:15] and I went over to grab his hand it said hey man we're gonna get you out of your hanging there
[01:14:19] and he like sat up and told me he was okay I was like it was unbelievable to see that I'm
[01:14:24] just how tough that guy was and you know after that we were waiting for about three weeks to see
[01:14:35] he lost his right eye where he got hit and we realized later that he the only reason he didn't
[01:14:40] get killed is because he was disciplined and he was on that machine and we were we were two hours
[01:14:46] into an operation it was a brutally hot day you know probably hitting 117 degree high in
[01:14:52] Ramadi and and he was on his weapon looking down the sights and the round that was aimed for
[01:14:58] his head hit his weapon hit the receiver on that machine gun and and deflected kind of back
[01:15:05] toward the right side of his face rather than taking a set off and and that's what saved his life
[01:15:10] that discipline and but tragically not only did he lose his right eye but the shrapnel from that
[01:15:16] severed the the optic nerve to his left eye and he was left blind completely blind from that
[01:15:22] and it was devastating when I got the news from that and yet when I talked to him on the phone
[01:15:26] and he'd been intubated so he had this kind of really horse voice right so you know because they'd
[01:15:31] had him in an induced coma for a while I think it was a week or so several days it was a long time
[01:15:38] and it seemed like forever and so we're waiting to hear you know sights going to come back or he's
[01:15:43] going to you know have his left eye I mean this is the difference between you know
[01:15:47] permanently disabled for the rest of his life or just having a new sense of not having you know one
[01:15:52] eye and when we got that word is devastation I mean I'm talking to him on the phone and he
[01:15:57] didn't this horse you know horse voice he's talking to just tell me it's okay and he's joking about
[01:16:01] wanting to get a parrot on his shoulder and eye patch you know so he could look like a pirate and he just
[01:16:07] to just a phenomenal guy and I don't know that I ever had a conversation with with Ryan from that
[01:16:13] day forward that where we did it laugh hysterically I mean he was the kind of guy that just
[01:16:18] looked at all the things he could still do in life was not going to dwell on his disability
[01:16:24] was not dwell on the fact that his eyesight had been taken from him in the prime of his life
[01:16:28] you know and he just was a phenomenal guy he showed me the true meaning of toughness
[01:16:35] and he just was of selflessness and it was it was just it was phenomenal be around
[01:16:42] I mean he was just he would he was just such a fun again I you know you were I was thinking about it
[01:16:47] when I was I was listening to it earlier podcast and you were quoting from the book that I gave you
[01:16:53] about the time you gave me about face I think a few months after that you get I gave you the
[01:16:57] wars I knew it by a general geologist Pat and junior and I was thinking you know Jaclyn mentioned
[01:17:02] that we were watching Pat and in Ramadi and just to put that respect we were watching we were
[01:17:08] project the film up onto the back wall of the camp and literally it's about a 20 foot high wall
[01:17:13] just on the other side of this wall is bad guys I mean if we actually did a bunch of
[01:17:19] operations right outside that wall so I mean this so here we are you know watch we're all in
[01:17:23] PT geared smoking cigars it went in our like workout you know shorts and shirts we're in
[01:17:28] flip flops you had like a you know these huge camel spiders run across your feet you don't want to
[01:17:33] get bitten by those things they're pretty nasty but we watched that movie a patent and our
[01:17:37] member of a ticket Ryan was just so he was so he thought it was so hilarious there's a scene in
[01:17:44] the movie which is a phenomenal you had to say the George C. Scott movie is phenomenal but there's a
[01:17:50] scene the movie where Pat and gets passed over for promotion and one of his peers Omar Bradley
[01:17:55] who had actually been a subordinate to Pat and he is getting promoted above Pat and so it's obviously
[01:18:01] devastating it's obviously crushing for Pat and so one of his aides runs up to him and
[01:18:07] he has the news but Pat doesn't have the news yet and he's like Sir General can I pour you a
[01:18:14] warm glass of milk can I draw you bath and Ryan for some reason thought that was absolutely
[01:18:20] hilarious and I remember on multiple operations we'd come back you know what guys were smoked and tired
[01:18:25] and bigles a rope to me and say Sir can I pour you warm glass of milk can I draw you back
[01:18:32] and just laugh and stare if that was like shut the hell up but we had some good times the
[01:18:39] first one I remember talking to him on the phone when he came out of the induced coma and again
[01:18:45] you know like you I'm thinking you know what do you say right and of course
[01:18:55] he just put you at ease and just starts making jokes and then he says to me it's serious and he says to me
[01:19:03] I want to come back
[01:19:33] he says I want to come back can I come back and you know I said to him listen
[01:19:51] just get healed up and you can come back and he's like Roger that and he goes don't worry
[01:20:05] and I said don't worry what he said don't worry I can still shoot and I said okay and he goes
[01:20:14] and Sir I can smell that I said what he was I can smell the enemy and I'll know where to shoot
[01:20:25] and I said all right if you get healed up I will bring you back over here and unfortunately I mean
[01:20:32] he was in real rough shape it wasn't like he was just blind I mean he had massive damage to his
[01:20:38] signuses to his face and you know we didn't get to your home before he could even even
[01:20:46] would have a possibility of coming back but he certainly would have of course no doubt about it
[01:20:50] and that was incredibly genuine and that's just the kind of guy Ryan was and and what's amazing is
[01:20:57] you know he he went on to do so many things and you know he married his his girlfriend the time
[01:21:04] was it is a phenomenal lady incredibly incredibly phenomenal lady and he went back to school
[01:21:12] after he got out he was medically retired he graduated with a business degree at a 4.0 I was like
[01:21:21] Ryan I do I think I had like a 2.8 3 like but I got well I said man what like what in the world
[01:21:29] and I mean he just he just could not be kept down and and he went and climbed he's some
[01:21:35] of the mountain near 14,000 plus foot mountain completely blind I mean that's a difficult mountain
[01:21:41] a lot of people get killed trying to climb that mountain with the full use of their limbs and
[01:21:46] and eyesight and and he went and did that great organization called Camp Patriot that helps
[01:21:52] wounded that and it taken him up on that climb and he called me up and said hey life we're going
[01:22:01] elk hunting and something we talked about in Iraq because Ryan was a big hunter grew up in
[01:22:06] in Washington state and had going on and I grew up in Texas and I loved to hunt and and I
[01:22:11] went on a call rod I'd hunted up there elk hunting so we talked about doing an elk hunt and
[01:22:17] you know now I thought well it's we can go you know we can listen to the elk and he can be
[01:22:23] you know part of the hot but he can't you know how can he actually shoot an animal we can't
[01:22:27] actually do that anymore and he said it's like they got some kind of gadget tree for me
[01:22:33] you know set up he's like I'm gonna shoot an elk and I was like is it are you in it was kind of like
[01:22:39] hunter-divered and I was like I'm in absolutely I'm in and I think it was like my 10-year
[01:22:46] naval carrier to go I was like cancel that we're going on so Ryan and I went uh went up there with
[01:22:52] camp-pature they had this crazy like gadget set up on the on the the scope of the weapon and it was
[01:23:00] up it was a camera and and it was so you could look through it the sights and so we kind of had this
[01:23:05] I was spotting form looking through the camera we kind of got in situated kind of told him when
[01:23:10] it went to hold we kind of had like a ready fire terminology we came up with and one thing
[01:23:16] about Ryan is that dude could shoot and you know he he struggled at Nyland originally keeping up
[01:23:21] and you know with his physical fitness until he became bigdles 2000 then was born again hard
[01:23:27] but when we got to our shooting schools we realized what this guy could shoot he was a great
[01:23:32] shot and so when we were training with that that rifle we were on the range and we were practiced
[01:23:36] into going this elk hunt I'm talking a man on the target I realized right away like if we
[01:23:41] missed it's my fault because he's gonna be he's gonna write when I tell him to pull the trigger he's
[01:23:45] hitting that target and he's gonna it's gonna be right wherever that cross area so we kind of figured it out
[01:23:50] and we went out and tracked this this huge elk down that was donated by a you know a great
[01:23:57] great good folks and we went out the shot a gigantic like a little class elk and he was and then
[01:24:05] once we got it we're cleaning the thing and he just you know he just he wanted to got his hands
[01:24:10] in there like elbow deep and and in the cleaning process and just it was it was a phenomenal
[01:24:15] phenomenal experience and Ryan just couldn't meet he could not be kept down he he focused on everything
[01:24:20] then he could still do and it was some of the things I couldn't even explain I remember when
[01:24:26] he was living in the Phoenix area and I went out to visit him and we're dry we had gone out to breakfast
[01:24:33] and we're driving back to his house and this is he only moved there after his blind so he never
[01:24:40] been in this area before and we're driving past you like you just missed the turn and I'm like obviously
[01:24:47] I'm driving he's blind he's sitting in the past you're seeing it I was like what do you mean how do you
[01:24:51] know that is that I just you should have turned back there and I was like you know soon it
[01:24:57] I was from my little smart phone I met math it out and it was like you're exactly right
[01:25:01] I'm going to do a new turn go back I don't know he had laid it out in his mind just the grid the
[01:25:05] grid system and what how long it took to go where and it was it was phenomenal and he taught
[01:25:10] me so much about just toughness and selflessness and just the attitude of being a little overcome
[01:25:17] many challenge to be thankful for the bless is even given and he was just just of incredibly
[01:25:23] awesome warrior teammate and friend and and we miss him I used to grapple with him you know after
[01:25:33] he was blind and he wrestled he wrestled in high school and so he had some scrap to him and
[01:25:43] I remember you know first of all he used to have that tears that come out of that eye
[01:25:48] so he'd be like constantly kind of wiping the eye and getting tears all over me
[01:25:51] then I'd be given a hard time about that like quick grind on the baby
[01:25:57] Yeah, but it was awesome it was awesome that's a great sport that you can do you know just it's you realize how much
[01:26:02] contact is involved when you're when you're doing that and how you can it's so instinctual and
[01:26:08] but that was another thing he just was like oh yeah I'll grapple I don't care can't see no factor
[01:26:13] and I always had to make him pay for the for the the time
[01:26:18] wait where the Chris that's one of Chris Kyle's little you know little scams that he played was
[01:26:27] Let me let me let me tell that that was uh because I had I had a good eye witness to this scenario
[01:26:34] so jocco's our task in a commander you know and he's a black belt resilient you jits
[01:26:38] who never one knows this because we're training at five o'clock every morning and we're all showing
[01:26:42] up and doing jitsu and it's show can each other out you can always see our you could tell who our
[01:26:48] taskin it was because when you called a name of someone we would turn our heads return our entire
[01:26:53] shoulders at the same time because our next we're getting cranked up that's right because we had
[01:27:00] just battled Royale as you would encourage it but in particular you know Chris and we talked about
[01:27:06] Chris Kyle since the year was a phenomenal guy he had a great relationship with with with Ryan and
[01:27:10] really kind of took Ryan under his wing and and one of the things Chris like to do was
[01:27:16] instigate he was a huge instigator and and so they would they they talked Ryan into like hey
[01:27:24] bigdles come here you know some bigdles the new guys fired up like hey I want you to go get up
[01:27:30] in a safe space you know so you and they they'd have him come up and like standing your face in
[01:27:35] like stare at you like one like one millimeter from your nose yes that's what you do which was obviously
[01:27:40] it's very provocative and and so that was the whole point they were trying to just instigate some kind
[01:27:46] of which you know I I just shoved them across the room get out of my face you know they had him do
[01:27:51] it to jaco he wouldn't do it for a little bit he kind of did everybody else and and so they're like
[01:27:57] you're gonna do it to jaco you know you know you know he balls you would do it to jaco so finally he's
[01:28:03] like I'm sick of these guys tell me I got a poo I'm a new guy I mean they said these manhoods on the
[01:28:07] line I'm gonna go do it to jaco and we and he did it in a pretty public forum because we were
[01:28:13] we were planning this is on our trip we're actually practicing like urban assaults so we're in
[01:28:19] this kind it's kind of a theater type set and guys are you know planning the mission and I remember
[01:28:25] watching every so they not only they talked him into it jaco doesn't know this but we all know
[01:28:29] it's common so everyone's watching this and it's all of a sudden jaco turns around it's so I think
[01:28:36] Chris or some like he's like hey jaco jaco turns around and bigels it's standing like one millimeter
[01:28:42] from his face given this like needle stared down and jaco just grabs him like you know grabs
[01:28:48] him like turns him around you know gets his back within like in like half a second and just throws
[01:28:55] a throw a rear naked choke on him and he had to go sleepy time and he's like yeah so you got a rear
[01:29:04] naked choke on you're like tapping he's like tapping tapping tapping and jaco's like I don't accept
[01:29:09] taps and he just it's so he goes to sleep jaco just kind of gently lays him down on the floor
[01:29:16] and then we just kind of and he just went on about anyway that's kind of normal day of the
[01:29:20] year and then you know so like you know six or eight seconds goes by he like comes back kind of slowly
[01:29:25] comes to gets up to a knee then stands up he's like kind of moves around like what happened
[01:29:31] and we're all kind of jaco's just acting like nothing happened to the other day and everyone is laughing
[01:29:36] hysterically and then you know rhymes like you're going to have my back because they told like
[01:29:42] we'll have you back and so I did like coach when I was like hey bigels look man they're not going
[01:29:48] to have your back to a whole point I wanted to see you get choked out so so after that I think it was a good
[01:29:53] learning experience but pretty legit good time and he was a great great sport about that just like
[01:29:59] everything else yeah yeah so like you said just an amazing amazing amazing guy and if anybody wants to
[01:30:08] anybody's feeling sorry for themselves or you know these people that ask about mental toughness just
[01:30:14] think yourself about about right there's one more guy that that I've been asked about a decent
[01:30:27] amount and it's a guy that was in the lift hotel in the markedly episode and again I was new
[01:30:37] that you'd be coming on at some point to talk about and we'd have an opportunity to talk about
[01:30:41] Tony and Tony Fraddy and Tony is a guy that I actually grew up with in the seal teams he was
[01:30:54] and and just as you might suspect when you watch live to tell and you see what his attitude is like
[01:31:02] he was a hard drinking fist fighting beer swilling frog man
[01:31:08] and you know and still is and still is to this day and there was you know how often he would
[01:31:16] come to work on Monday morning with a shinner or brood you know bloody knuckles it was just it was just
[01:31:22] a normal occurrence I mean no we didn't even get asked questions about it back then so Tony Fraddy
[01:31:27] was an old school seal team one guy that you know kind of like me grew up in the seal teams and grew
[01:31:34] up in that era of the 90s and the dry years still had some Vietnam veteran mentorship but
[01:31:42] didn't really get that opportunity to be in combat until you know until obviously until September
[01:31:48] 11th and what we actually even though we were both that team one together we were never an
[01:31:56] opportunity together so we were buddies we were drinking buddies we hung out but we never did
[01:32:00] a platoon together and so I knew he had a very good reputation he had a very good reputation as an
[01:32:05] operator he always had that but I never really worked with him it wasn't until we were in task
[01:32:11] unit bruiser together that I actually worked with him for the first time and when I realized
[01:32:20] for the first time what I had in Tony beyond the toughness and beyond the tactical prowess was
[01:32:32] when we were actually at we were at land warfare training the training that you were just talking
[01:32:36] about and you know there was a little kind of a quick operation to pull off and it was just a
[01:32:45] quick you know hey go and assault this area it was the daytime it was basically going through the
[01:32:49] mechanics of an assault on a target and I was watching you and Tony Tony was your platoon chief I was
[01:32:57] watching you to kind of figure out the plan and you threw a couple ideas out there and he just said
[01:33:03] hey sir here's what we should do boom put these guys over here set up a base over here bring the
[01:33:07] maneuver over here but one over watch position on this hill that's how we should do this and
[01:33:13] you looked at him and said that's awesome that's perfect let's get everyone over here and
[01:33:19] why don't you just go ahead and breathe them up and he looked at you and he said
[01:33:24] Nusser you tell him what to do it'll be better coming from you and so here was a guy that
[01:33:31] obviously because he'd been in the teams for 15 or 17 years obviously had more tactical experience than
[01:33:38] you did but he was so secure in his leadership and so secure in his tactical knowledge that it didn't
[01:33:47] mean anything to him and he realized that the best thing that he could do for the team and for
[01:33:51] your platoon was to let you lead this let you put out the word let you give the plan and I realized
[01:34:01] at that point and this was early in our work up that this guy was not just a tactician not just a
[01:34:06] tough badass frogman but he was a real leader and as I know you will say you are absolutely blessed
[01:34:17] to have Tony as your platoon chief I gotta say the seal team has produced some phenomenal
[01:34:25] phenomenal individuals some incredible battlefield leaders throughout the decades in the proud legacy
[01:34:32] and history of the seal teams and I can say with confidence that I believe that Tony for
[01:34:41] that he is probably one of the best combat leaders of seal teams has ever produced and I don't say
[01:34:48] that very lightly at all but he was a phenomenal phenomenal battlefield leader and you've heard of
[01:34:52] the break glass in case of war guys this is this is that guy and he was just
[01:34:58] his experience level was phenomenal I mean he had had at this point to put it respectly visible
[01:35:06] ten commander I'm on my second one so I had one deployment to Iraq joku had a few deployments before
[01:35:11] because he was you know he would have been a enlistment for eight years and but you know Tony was this was his
[01:35:18] eighth deployment I mean he had massive amounts of experience in the teams I think he had been busted
[01:35:22] down in rank like twice you know hard fight and guy and he was he wanted to be that platoon chief
[01:35:29] that's all he ever wanted to be and he was incredibly incredibly good at it I just I can remember
[01:35:37] that same land war for a chat of you were just talking about we're under fire we're in a very
[01:35:42] difficult situation there's a lot of chaos going on in this training environment here we are
[01:35:47] preparing for actual combat and of course they're trying to make that as realistic as possible
[01:35:52] and it's challenging as possible and we're getting shot at from like one of the target buildings and
[01:35:57] it's made out of like you know two by fours and and plywood the target building that's that's nearby
[01:36:06] Tony realizes that we got a self at target building now because we're taking fire from that building
[01:36:12] and he does a like full on sprit like wide open for about 50 yards and does human
[01:36:19] battering ram into the doorway one man clearance the building and like kills the role player who's
[01:36:24] shooting at us and it was like that's who's he's he's the total badass he's gonna handle the
[01:36:30] situation and that's the guy he was on the battlefield I mean he definitely he was he was a guy
[01:36:36] I mean we leaned on him the the only time that I ever had an issue working for Jockel will like
[01:36:43] he was when Jockel said hey I'm gonna have to put Tony with this other group of guys
[01:36:48] that's right and I was like I was furious and angry about that in a way that was and until
[01:36:54] Jockel kind of took me under his wing he said you said hey here's why I'm doing that and here's why
[01:37:00] I had to balance out some leadership you know and we put him with the most junior guy put on with
[01:37:05] most junior officer who isn't incredibly capable guy and and did phenomenal stuff but it was the
[01:37:11] right call the death it was the right call as much as I hated that but that was that was difficult
[01:37:16] but Tony was just one of those guys that you know he was intimately evolved in the planning
[01:37:20] default aggressive I mean just incredibly aggressive we're gonna go in there and we're gonna
[01:37:25] hammer the enemy we're gonna go right in his backyard we're never gonna expect this and and
[01:37:30] we're gonna we're gonna win we're gonna crush them they're gonna kill bad guys and and one of
[01:37:34] the things that gained us momentum you know you talked about earlier Jockel of the the mortars that hit right
[01:37:40] outside the building you were sitting in and killed the soldier wounded several others we had IDs going
[01:37:46] often you were sitting in there and and the you were sitting in there and the you were going to
[01:37:50] brigade I went to I was actually I met the brigade commander once I think or maybe twice but I
[01:37:56] went in there actually no what no it was the first time I ever met the brigade commander so I
[01:38:02] go into meet the guy that's in charge of all of Ramadi and as I go into meet him I'm into I'm
[01:38:11] in his tactical operations center and we had put guys Tony was out in the field doing a sniper
[01:38:17] Overwatch for an ID for ID in place there's in an area called Firecracker where there was IDs all
[01:38:24] the time and where days earlier an ID had gone off and had killed several Marines and wounded several more
[01:38:34] so I come into the tactical operation center and and I'm in there for 30 seconds and a call comes in
[01:38:41] and it's the Marines reporting back that one of the seal snipers had just killed an ID in place
[01:38:45] or on firecracker and the brigade commander came out of his office to kind of see what what wait what
[01:38:52] and then there I was and so it was the again like with the mortars I could not have ever
[01:38:59] set up a better introduction to the brigade commander than saying then then that happening at that
[01:39:05] moment in time and we've been on the ground for maybe two or three days and already starting to
[01:39:10] have an impact taken out these bad guys and and that fired the brigade commander up and he immediately
[01:39:15] wanted to employ us in different locations throughout the city and that was like a blank check for
[01:39:21] for getting after it for us was oh you want us to go into these worst the worst parts of
[01:39:25] our body we will do so and we will do so immediately and that's exactly what we did
[01:39:32] Tony really had a vision too as far as getting the platoon ready and making sure that we knew
[01:39:36] he he had a feeling that we might need some sniper capability and so we plossed up the number of
[01:39:43] snipers well beyond what the normal number is within our 60 man seal platoon to be ready for that and
[01:39:49] he trained him and got him ready and and certainly leaned on Chris and his expertise there but
[01:39:55] but Tony was really the driving force of getting our platoon qualified and ready to go and I
[01:40:00] remember one time I particularly where we were we were we were looking through a we had moved into a
[01:40:06] really really nasty area of south central mining and there were two buildings that were right next to each
[01:40:12] other and we were several of us where I was in a group that was at with across the street the
[01:40:18] Chris Chris and I were together on that one Tony was with another group of guys that were
[01:40:22] across that were in a different set of buildings and the building that we were in just it just
[01:40:27] wasn't a good position and we were trying to figure out where we need to go but it just was not
[01:40:31] a good position the sun was going to come up within you know pretty soon we needed to get
[01:40:35] it was just so we actually fell back and took a building right next to where Tony is guys
[01:40:39] where we actually smashed through the concrete wall connecting them the wall the support there
[01:40:46] there was no doorway or anything window but we had to make a walkways we could actually like
[01:40:50] get it out and communicate with each other and I'm sitting there listening the radio and
[01:40:55] you know my command control position after the sun came up and Tony was a sniper looking through
[01:40:59] a loophole in the wall which is like a hole that was maybe six or eight inches on a diameter that
[01:41:04] we smashed out with a sledgehammer sometimes we used explosive charges but it gave you a little bit
[01:41:09] of cover so that you didn't get shot in the face by some enemy another enemy sniper across the
[01:41:14] street or some ice you would have a machine gun and so he's sitting there on a sniper rifle
[01:41:19] and I just hear this crack and it was just a round coming in and it missed his head by like two
[01:41:26] inches maybe I mean it came right in just you know whizzed past his face slam into the wall just behind him
[01:41:32] and so I hear the crack and then I hear some profanity and then I hear some yeah I like Rambo Stel
[01:41:39] yeah and then I hear just machine gun fire yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and so Tony
[01:41:46] had the round and coming in past his face and Tony was best and he reached over grab a
[01:41:52] Marnt 40 machine gun and dumped a hundred round belt through the you know through the
[01:41:57] the loophole we had no idea where the round really came from but a hundred rounds got shot back
[01:42:01] in the general direction and I think that was discouraging whoever was shooting in it so
[01:42:05] that's a kind of guy who told me what he was he was gonna you should want to bullet at me
[01:42:09] I'm sure I'm not going to let you back and you know he was the guy too we because he
[01:42:15] in that relationship with you when I first checked into Cilteam 3 me and the Delta
[01:42:20] Lieutenant Commander who's a good friend of mine that we gone through Budsweather,
[01:42:22] Jaco, Reference earlier you know we heard about this guy, Jaco and and interestingly enough I
[01:42:31] actually heard your name before mispronounce of course Jaco Willenek from a guy that I grew up with
[01:42:39] when I was in like high school and he started training in Jiu Jitsu and I was starting to talk
[01:42:45] about beat in the Cilteam so I wanted to be a seal on hitting the air our family friend and said yeah
[01:42:49] I rolled Jiu Jitsu with this guy who's a seal this name was Jaco Willenek and he beat me in this
[01:42:55] turn of his a great guy and I see he was talking about you and so so I had heard that name before
[01:43:00] and and then we were working together team 3 I was like okay I heard this guy Jaco it's actually
[01:43:06] for now to Willenek Jaco Willenek okay this is that same guy that I heard about you know years ago before
[01:43:11] I was even in the Navy and so you know who is this guy we had met him before I knew a bunch of the
[01:43:18] guys already in the Paltoon and Tony said I'm ever standing there looking at the board we have
[01:43:26] the boards like magnet boards of all the names are going to be in the Paltoon and you know I'm
[01:43:31] I'm at the top of the OIC and then Tony's next and then you know what's your guys in our
[01:43:35] youth Chris is kind of right up there and and he's like we're like he said what can you tell us
[01:43:41] about Jaco he's like Jaco is the guy we want us our task in a commander we're good to go
[01:43:46] that's like Roger that we're good so that was that was my first introduction to Jaco
[01:43:54] yeah yeah and then as the Delta Potigimit, Jaco gave us this typical stare down
[01:43:58] I am Jaco I don't like people when I face when he meets us I'm going to intimidate you
[01:44:04] and look at you with Ferrod Brow and jutting out Jaco and I might have to fire you guys and
[01:44:10] I don't know two weeks through weeks we never know so the Delta Potigimit is now you know just
[01:44:15] you start a good buddy years and a great buddy of mine was was like who is this guy me he's
[01:44:20] stared at me I don't know if you like so I can already tell yeah and Tony was like listen
[01:44:25] he's good to go don't you worry Tony awesome just outstanding and I think one of the things
[01:44:37] that impressed me about him was that he those old Vietnam lessons the old school just hardcore
[01:44:45] frogman stuff he held the line on that as far as getting ready as far as gear inspections as
[01:44:53] far as debriefs and the planning he just he just had that intense level of patience and of
[01:45:05] focus on the operations like nothing else in the world mattered to him a he drove standards
[01:45:13] no doubt I mean he enforced standards and he was just expected expected us to be hard you know
[01:45:19] when guys wanted to get soft and hey you know do we really need to push ourselves out like no
[01:45:24] we're going to be hard and you know is that new Hampshire new Hampshire ax that did say you better
[01:45:30] get you can't hide we're going we're going out to get it on and you know one of the things
[01:45:34] that became a mantra for our Patum was BTF big tough frogman and what Tony would say that like hey
[01:45:41] where we knew like we're going to be TF what are we going to do we're going to be TF in
[01:45:46] we're going to get a big mix it up which meant a big gunfight they're going to be TF out
[01:45:51] and then we added big child we're going to go to big child hit the child we're done but
[01:45:55] BTF meant we're going to go in it's going to be hard it's going to be tough we better you know
[01:45:59] we're going to carry a lot of these roads were so dangerous we didn't drive this we would
[01:46:03] put patrol in for you know kilometers carry in heavy gear tons of water with us we had to
[01:46:09] bring all that stuff in and it was just it was tough it was difficult and we were going to be TF
[01:46:15] and we took pride in that you know BTF pretty much came became a way to overcome any obstacle of any kind
[01:46:22] mental physical environmental all yet to do just BTF you know oh there's some kind of a challenge
[01:46:30] at BTF BTF and then what are we going to do BTF more I see a rubber Tony said he's you know I don't
[01:46:39] see a lot and he doesn't sleep a lot so we would spend time together we never really sleep it
[01:46:45] and he'd come down to my office and I say what are you doing up and he goes all is just laying in my
[01:46:50] bed just BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF BTF so I've come and thank for you to come down and see
[01:46:56] I remember him sitting in the camp he would get you could track it we'd come back from an
[01:47:00] op he'd be happy he was fired up we drop our gear every single time with with great tremendous
[01:47:06] discipline I talked about him in forces standards hey we just got dealt with an op everyone's
[01:47:10] tired everybody's exhausted drop your gear is what he tell everybody you know 10 minutes I
[01:47:15] want you in the mission planning space and we go through that post operation debrief just
[01:47:19] talking about what went right what went wrong will we learn from it what's the enemy doing now
[01:47:23] that we hadn't seen before how come we adapted that every single time there was no cut in the
[01:47:27] corners we did that every time we could do it and kind of a short concise concise form but he'd be
[01:47:32] happy we just got back from the op we just went out did some damage and then you could track
[01:47:36] Tony's like happiness factor it was inversely proportional is happiness factor was inversely
[01:47:44] proportional to the amount of time we spent in the camp so as at the longer we stayed in the camp he's like
[01:47:48] he's like getting angry I'm getting angry and if we had an op cancel which was pretty rare
[01:47:54] but ever once while we'd have a night where we didn't go out and he would just be angry I
[01:47:59] want to go out I want to go get some why are we in the camp and you know as we wrap up on Tony
[01:48:09] and Tony was definitely a force but just so everybody knows that this was a task unit of 40 plus
[01:48:19] guys and there was absolutely a core group in there and Charlie and Delta between of guys that were
[01:48:28] without question without any question whatsoever warriors that
[01:48:37] like I said held the line and told the line and went forward over and over again
[01:48:50] and and the rest of the guys maybe the guys that weren't quite in leadership positions
[01:48:55] but it was a very tough deployment casualties fire fights
[01:49:01] killed wounded and there was stress massive amounts of stress and there was combat fatigue
[01:49:16] and there was fear but all these guys overcame that fear to do their job
[01:49:28] so we could accomplish the mission that was put in front of us I think that something has to be
[01:49:36] recognized you know and it's uh some of these guys are still active duty and we we can't we're
[01:49:41] not gonna name them we're not gonna talk about them but they were a critical critical part of the
[01:49:46] team and that it's not you know as we kind of back to what we were talking about with America
[01:49:49] Cypher earlier I mean I think Chris would be the first person to tell you that this is a team effort
[01:49:54] it is a huge team effort and so we could have done the Cypher's gonna do any of the stuff
[01:49:59] there doing without the machine gunners without guys carrying the rockets without the guys
[01:50:03] carrying the radio and all the heavy equipment that goes with that and you know the corpsman
[01:50:08] that's carrying his you know all of his equipment we couldn't have done any of that as seals
[01:50:12] without the support from the army and Marine Corps and would support those guys brought to us and so
[01:50:17] it was a massive massive team effort and just particularly those guys in in charge of
[01:50:21] the team and I was I just kind of been more proud of of our guys going through some incredibly
[01:50:28] difficult situations and and stepping up and getting the job done and and making the best of
[01:50:33] a very bad situation doing what they need to do and it is it was just an honor it was an honor
[01:50:41] to serve with those guys it always be we had some horrific days I would do anything to trade those
[01:50:45] days I do anything to trade places with with Marqulee and and with Ryan Job in Charitableton who gave
[01:50:54] their lives but most of those days were the best days of my life and always will be and
[01:51:04] it was just such an honor and a privilege to be part of that. Everyone damn it to get the Delta
[01:51:11] Platoon commander on here and I'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna say the same thing about
[01:51:14] his crew and the work that they did and the incredibly harsh environment that they went through
[01:51:21] and the sustained combat operations that they conducted as well so thanks to all those guys
[01:51:33] and thank you Jockel Willick for being our leader for training us for teaching us for inspiring us
[01:51:52] for instilling in us this default aggressive mindset to go out on the battlefield into the
[01:52:00] fray into the worst most dangerous areas and make a difference and win and none of that would have
[01:52:11] been possible without your leadership and I'm proud of served with him and I could tell you that was
[01:52:22] you read your speech earlier that speech was incredibly powerful it's something that
[01:52:32] resonated across the seal teams with me my generation of seals and every seal that I knew
[01:52:40] are worked with about what that meant and it really captured so much of what we'd think
[01:52:48] in a way that maybe other folks couldn't articulate it but it's certainly captured the message
[01:52:54] of what seals should be doing the nature of or how we need to train how we need to prefer ourselves
[01:53:01] and how we always need to remain there and when you gave that speech and I was honored to
[01:53:08] to give a speech as well at that retirement ceremony but as you pack your bags and retire to
[01:53:14] and let the seal teams I remember thinking it's a sad day in the jockel of seal teams
[01:53:23] and it really really was but you certainly left your mark on the seal teams not only for me
[01:53:30] and all the guys from T-Roo's that we serve with but the generations of seals
[01:53:36] that you trained that you passed on those leadership lessons out too so we thank you
[01:53:40] I'm not dead yet but thanks thanks brother appreciate it it's awesome and yeah let's
[01:53:54] let's quit talking about each other and let's get some questions from the internet out of that sound
[01:53:59] I'm with that echo by the way echo Charles is here today echo Charles yeah
[01:54:04] hey guys how are you doing it? I'm going to be here with you all the good. Well come back. Yeah right on well
[01:54:10] I might as well read you guys some questions right yeah it's filled in my way fire away
[01:54:17] all right cool first question I'm just going to direct these at both of you guys yeah
[01:54:23] so jockel and life assuming someone would be a good seal officer would you suggest they go
[01:54:32] and listed first get experience then becoming officer would you suggest that?
[01:54:41] or the other choice would be just go straight officer commission so right I guess we have both
[01:54:47] of those examples here I was enlisted first way to win straight commission out of the
[01:54:52] Naval Academy and I think we're probably going to say pretty much the same thing here in terms of
[01:55:02] to me it doesn't really matter it doesn't really matter where you get your commission from it
[01:55:09] doesn't really matter if you get a commission it doesn't really matter there's guys in the
[01:55:14] sealed teams there's enlisted senior leaders that are awesome examples there are awesome leaders
[01:55:18] they change people's lives they have a huge impact on the battlefield there's obviously
[01:55:22] officers to do the same thing I think you know I added incredibly lucky career and I had a great
[01:55:29] career and I wouldn't change any part of it at all you know I was lucky enough to to be an
[01:55:37] enlisted guy and do multiple deployments as an enlisted guy and then being an officer and do multiple
[01:55:40] deployments as an officer and it was great and I wouldn't change any part of it and I know plenty of
[01:55:48] guys that were officers in their whole career and they wouldn't change any of that and I know plenty
[01:55:53] of guys that wouldn't list the guys that are whole career and they wouldn't change any of that so I think
[01:55:59] the important thing is think about what piece of the puzzle you want to fit into the what you
[01:56:05] really want your expertise and your job to be I don't really think life you wish you would have
[01:56:15] done sometime as an e-dog as a sled dog for sure I mean look there's there's a part of me that
[01:56:21] certainly always wishes that but look I think it's it's just a different it's a different job you're
[01:56:27] going to always as an officer straight out of a commission source I had to lean on those I had to
[01:56:33] lean on those chiefs I had to lean on those leading pedda officers those folks who had experience
[01:56:37] who could help me and guide me and you know no matter who you are you're not going to have
[01:56:42] it all figured out and it's something that each I'll go you talk about often we talk about often
[01:56:46] and when we work with companies so having run our leadership course what we call the junior officer
[01:56:52] training course and every single seal officer that graduates from you know from every commissioning
[01:56:58] source that graduates from the seal training pipeline goes through this course it's about a five week
[01:57:03] course four week of classroom one week of a field training exercise where we're kind of out
[01:57:08] of field and putting these guys through some some challenges and I I led that for two years I
[01:57:13] instructed that course and I think we put on 130 something officers to that and the best officer
[01:57:21] we had some great officers that went through that and probably the best officer I put through
[01:57:25] was a prior-listed seal we had some officers that struggled and probably the they guy who struggled
[01:57:31] the most was another prior-listed seal most of these guys had been prior-listed a commission officer
[01:57:36] so it just goes to show you that you've every source whether it's a naval academy whether it's
[01:57:41] prior-listed and going to see an animal program whether it's coming in through OCS officer
[01:57:46] candidate school or or you know at universities you've got outstanding people that come out of
[01:57:53] those those commissioning sources you got some people that aren't that good that come out of
[01:57:56] those commission sources so it's about you and I think it's it's kind of immaterial. The physical part
[01:58:04] is pretty important right going in well of course you got to have some level of athleticism
[01:58:10] but it's not the two of it's not it's just it just if you yes show up and be ready to make it through
[01:58:17] the training but that's right that has next to nothing to do with your ability to lead people
[01:58:23] of course you have to be physically fit you have to be able I mean there's no doubt you have to be
[01:58:27] physically fit yeah that's like that's like a ground base no doubt about it so if you don't have
[01:58:35] that you're not even close so everybody that is gonna be in a leadership position in the
[01:58:39] seal teams is physically that period got you okay yeah for whatever reason thinking just to be a seal
[01:58:46] okay cool I have next question Jacqueline Lath are your books principles universal
[01:58:52] or only for us audience we work with audiences anywhere they applied anywhere I mean across
[01:59:03] the world human beings in any kind of leadership capacity in any capacity and you know business
[01:59:09] or life and Jacqueline I've actually done a lot of work internationally as well so we've done
[01:59:14] us spoken of groups in Europe I've worked with leadership training groups from China and
[01:59:20] spoken of Canada I'm at across the world where leaders or leaders are dealing with the same
[01:59:26] kind of problems same kind of issues this is not universal only applies to America to apply
[01:59:32] anywhere yeah and what I found is in jockey always talk about like how it's relationships building
[01:59:39] relationships up and down the chain of command so and really that relationships
[01:59:44] theme is it's kind of everything in life where whether it's like your friends or your
[01:59:52] spouse has been alive or whatever in the teams or in business right so relationships
[01:59:58] applied to everybody in the whole world no matter what culture you are otherwise so
[02:00:04] each different type of person right where people who read your as book isn't
[02:00:09] always going to be a military guy or a business guy but I just I just had a friend who sent
[02:00:16] me a picture he was in Frankfurt, Germany walking through out of his hotel and there's a guy
[02:00:22] sitting in the lobby I like the coffee bar reading extreme ownership yeah and Germany so I mean
[02:00:27] this is it's everywhere and I think leaders who seek to be better I mean this this
[02:00:33] focus for them the principals in this book are for them and a lot of the companies who work with
[02:00:37] they even if they're based in the US they have they have ties to other countries manufacturing
[02:00:43] plants in Mexico or China or across the world and do business across the Atlantic Ocean
[02:00:49] it's a very international interconnected world out there and and I mean there's most of the
[02:00:54] companies who are working with these days have offices in South America or Asia or Europe and
[02:01:00] are there kind of worldwide this could then this is gonna sound kind of crazy but this could easily be
[02:01:08] a relationship counseling guide as well well obviously if you take extreme ownership of your
[02:01:14] relationship and you you realize where it could be you that could be the problem in your relationship yes
[02:01:21] now that being said echo Charles this will not turn into a relationship
[02:01:27] podcast not a married we're here to talk about war you're not gonna be Dr Laura yes it's not
[02:01:35] happening here not happening good try good try I go okay thanks next question tell us a story about Buds
[02:01:52] so so Buds is the basic seal training that you see on TV and that you see carrying people
[02:02:01] carrying logs on their heads and boats around and doing pushups and pullups and getting wet and
[02:02:05] sandy and the reason that I don't talk about Buds a lot is because it's not it's a tiny, tiny
[02:02:16] fraction of what the seal teams is all about and in fact when you get in the seal teams
[02:02:24] you realize that Buds is nothing more than a screening process to weed out people don't really want to be
[02:02:32] there but if you compare it to what you have to do once you get in the teams it's actually nothing
[02:02:40] because there's no way that you can compare hey you got to go get in cold ocean water and
[02:02:48] then roll around in the sand oh no then and I always think back to the the first time when I was
[02:02:57] in the I was in at Camp Curricodor and I'm rolling out of the first major operation we were doing
[02:03:02] in the malob district of Armani and there's tires burning the street there's smoke you can
[02:03:07] hear the gunfire getting wet and sandy and being cold is a joke compared to that so that's why
[02:03:20] the the whole Buds thing is is something that I just it's not that big of a deal and I think I think
[02:03:26] some guys trying to turn it into a big deal especially if that was kind of a highlight of their
[02:03:32] career was going through seal training but if you were in the teams and you deployed overseas then
[02:03:37] that shouldn't be the highlight of your career shouldn't be the highlight of your knowledge it shouldn't
[02:03:41] be the highlight of your of your the the man test that people like to consider Buds not a man test
[02:03:49] means you didn't quit being cold good job it's and to that point I think it's you know for those
[02:03:55] folks it didn't really get tested and combat or didn't get a chance to go out on the battlefield
[02:04:01] and experience the just incredible physical nature of combat and how difficult it is then you know
[02:04:10] Buds is like everything so they talk about Buds all the time and so it's kind of this legendary
[02:04:13] thing and it looks like it's a great training program it's been around for a long time it
[02:04:17] it's screens out the people that don't have the characteristics as Jaco said that we think
[02:04:21] we're going to be successful and it works and we should keep those standard time and we should push
[02:04:26] that I thought Buds was a pretty good time we had some great times in Buds I love the guys I
[02:04:29] went through Buds with most of them and but it's it's gotten nothing on combat and you know it's
[02:04:36] interesting that some of the the big political discussions today you know one of the one of them
[02:04:41] is the integration of women into the seal teams and dispatch operations into infantry units
[02:04:45] and everyone's always focused on you know well if they can be standards and if they're you know
[02:04:51] if if they can make it through training then they should be they should be you know they should
[02:04:56] be able to go out and serve right and they're focused on training and the people they're talking
[02:05:00] about training at the highest levels because they don't know what it's like to be in a real combat
[02:05:05] and real combat is infinitely harder than the toughest I mean why are we talking about integrating
[02:05:10] the NFL we got huge big strong guys that are smashing each other and yet that's you know maybe
[02:05:17] you get a concussion maybe you tear your ACL maybe you break your your elbow you know or snap
[02:05:22] up but snap your wrist you're not going to get killed very rarely to someone get killed in the
[02:05:27] football game right and where in combat is is infinitely harder than that including more difficult
[02:05:33] than that and so you know and and unlike a football game that's over and you know just a couple of
[02:05:38] hours you're talking about something that can last weeks months even years and it's just the
[02:05:44] physical nature of combat cannot be overstated it isn't incredibly difficult and when people are
[02:05:49] shocked to hear that I can tell me some stories about bugs okay the bugs is care some
[02:05:55] locks man don't don't quit okay I mean it's it's making through you know it's combat when you're
[02:06:03] and you'll see it to guys who excelled in bugs because they're great athletes sometimes I'll go to
[02:06:07] the battlefield and I remember the first time that an IED I saw an IED going off about a block away
[02:06:15] for me and we were sitting on the rooftop and a sniper position as my first deployment before
[02:06:19] Jocelyn I were working together and all of a sudden there's a hundred foot fireball that goes
[02:06:24] up in the year I mean the blast wave hits me and just knocks me on my ass and frags just metal
[02:06:30] fragments and sure to concrete and stuff just raining down all over the place from from a
[02:06:36] block away you know from us and it was it was like damn that is that is not something I want to be
[02:06:44] standing on around interviewing when you hit that thing and when you see something like that like just
[02:06:49] the kinetic energy of a round coming in and just you know think of the biggest strongest guy
[02:06:54] you can imagine with a sledgehammer smashing a wall next to you and you know multiply that time
[02:07:00] seven or eight hundred rounds of man for a bell for a machine gun and I mean it's incredibly
[02:07:04] difficult and dangerous and overwhelming and so you see some of the toughest guys that did well
[02:07:10] buds are like oh not necessarily eager to go out in that and so it's a whole new level of difficulty
[02:07:17] and it's it's just it can't be overstated so I think that it's it's the difficult as it
[02:07:23] combat again just cannot be overstated people need to understand what the reality that is like
[02:07:28] I think this idea that America is not going to we kind of dictate the nature of wars and you
[02:07:33] know as we've been told the tide of wars receding and it's just not true as Jaco said in his
[02:07:37] retirement speech the nature of war does not change and we're going to always have to fight
[02:07:43] wars we're going to always have to be a difficult conflicts we don't get to choose that and so
[02:07:48] we better be ready for those those difficulties in the late nineties we would hear that
[02:07:53] from from senior leadership that we know look the direct action mission we're not going to be doing
[02:08:00] these those anymore why would we do direct action mission we can send into the Tomahawk missile
[02:08:05] and then oh why would we do a reconnaissance when we can send over a drone and why would we go
[02:08:11] clear buildings house to house when we have technology that can put bombs right into buildings
[02:08:16] so this idea that we're going to have the ground wars are over we need to move on to the next
[02:08:20] phase of warfare and adapt to a new way of doing things and of course what was it eight years later
[02:08:29] September 11th happened we spent 15 years in Afghanistan and whatever 10 years in Iraq that
[02:08:36] on the ground doing those very missions that everyone thought were never to again so so yes the
[02:08:42] nature of war does not change and it's not about technology either you know some of the guys
[02:08:46] it don't make it through that training thing oh man if I just if I can just get through somehow
[02:08:50] and I'll get all this cool gear and I'll have night vision and lasers and I'll be badass and it's like
[02:08:55] it's not about that and and while we need to when you're an invested technology certainly and
[02:09:00] a quick armuletary accordingly it's the people that matter it's leadership at all levels that matter
[02:09:06] you know one of the one of my favorite quotes from the hero the Pacific War who was in charge of
[02:09:12] of the entire the the commander chief of of all forces US forces the Pacific I got him
[02:09:18] chestroom nimmets fleet admiral chestroom nimmets good old boy from from central Texas and he said
[02:09:26] our armament must be adequate to the needs but our faith is not primarily in these machines
[02:09:33] of defense but in ourselves and I mean that's that's just exactly true and we've got to we've
[02:09:38] got to always push those standards keep those standards high prepare people for the difficulties of
[02:09:44] real actual combat and just how physically demanding it is and crushing it can be and and be
[02:09:50] ready so then we can execute and we can win next next back to buds real quick that's how long
[02:10:00] is bud six months right yeah but 27 weeks or so because a lot of things it's like you know hell
[02:10:06] week right that's the time where you don't sleep that much or whatever I think some people think
[02:10:11] that that's but you know like you just don't sleep ever and it's all hard they drown you and then
[02:10:18] they bring you back to life yeah yeah not anyway next question aside from command what is your
[02:10:27] favorite operator specialty machine gunner preacher corpsman et cetera thanks
[02:10:32] well my personal preference was a radio man because I was a radio man when I was a young
[02:10:41] enlisted guy I was standing on the quarter deck standing quarter deck watching this this
[02:10:46] senior guy said to me what are you gonna do what are you gonna do to put you and I said I don't
[02:10:50] know maybe a machine gunner because of course when you're a young kid you want to be a machine
[02:10:53] no you know they're a machine gun and he said don't be a machine gunner you want to be a
[02:10:58] radio man because they go on every operation I said okay fair enough when upstairs and volunteer
[02:11:04] to be a radio man so they put this 30 pound radio on your back and carry the radio and it was very
[02:11:09] lucky for me because that got me in the position where I was part of planning even as a very
[02:11:17] junior guy I was part of the planning so I learned a lot about planning I was lucky because I
[02:11:21] did shipboard deployments so then I was involved in planning and working with the Marine Corps
[02:11:26] so I had some experience with big conventional units and I learned a lot then so I was always
[02:11:31] very preferential to the radio man I thought it was the the most seribilly challenging job
[02:11:39] now that being said let me tell you what I wanted my platoon's to think I wanted my platoon's to
[02:11:47] think that each guy was the most important guy you know I wanted the the radio man to think
[02:11:54] that he was the most important I want the corner to think he was the most important because he was
[02:11:56] going to save everybody I wanted the snipers to think they were most important they were going to
[02:11:59] kill everybody I wanted the machine gunners to think they were the most important because they
[02:12:02] were going to lay down the fire and get us out so I was always a big supporter of all of them
[02:12:12] and you need them all because it's a team and and you get those people like oh this is more important
[02:12:17] or this sort you know my job is the best and you know as we were talking about Chris and then
[02:12:22] the kind of portrayal in America sniper as the sniper and you've got to have that entire
[02:12:26] element working together you've got to have those machine gunners you've got to have the
[02:12:29] corpsman you've got to have the radio man who's passing position and you know where it's telling
[02:12:35] telling friend these where you are so you can get help you know directing help in where you need it
[02:12:40] you know and telling where the enemy is I mean all that stuff is absolutely critical I think as a
[02:12:46] as far as of favor it's specialty I like to shoot I like combat shooting combat rifle
[02:12:52] pistol shooting has always been one of my favorite things to do I love that about the seal
[02:12:55] teams you know training and combat rifle pistol shooting it you know moving and and hitting different
[02:13:00] targets and shooting against steel targets and we go to these amazing ranges and it's super fun
[02:13:05] and that being said that's not my job and that is that's a real realization you have to come to
[02:13:14] as a leader is that my job is not to shoot and I got to be able to shoot because there are times
[02:13:18] when I'm on the only guy can do that and I've got to be able to eliminate threat and I've got to be
[02:13:24] able to do it accurately so I have to be able to do that just like everybody else but that's not
[02:13:29] my job and I really learned that in our advanced training you know after buds there's another six
[02:13:34] months of what we call steel qualification training and and one of my instructors you know as
[02:13:41] Joaquin I often say like failure is sometimes the the is the best teacher often the best teacher
[02:13:45] and I remember I was trying to shoot laid-down fire for my squad that we're under fire we're shooting
[02:13:51] and I was actually trying to look around and I got a safety violation for that for like trying
[02:13:56] to shoot rounds down range and trying to look around I was like guess what you can't do both
[02:14:01] and I was like Roger that I should have gotten to say to you Valice's dangerous you never want to pull
[02:14:05] the trigger in your weapon if you're not looking down your weapon control and where the
[02:14:08] sights are and it was exactly what it should you know what should have happened but it was really
[02:14:12] a sensation of me like I can't do both and why do I need to be shooting right now because
[02:14:16] there's like eight other guys in the squad that are laying down fire and there's nobody else that's
[02:14:22] looking around it's my job to high-port my weapon which means it's pulling at the sky and I
[02:14:27] got to be looking around take a step back off the line Joaquin talks about detach and look around
[02:14:33] so I'm making that call as Commander Control and if I'm not doing that nobody's doing it and so
[02:14:37] leaders have to have to always be reckoned you have to understand the specialties you have to
[02:14:42] understand how that stuff works what the capabilities and limitations of your guys are you know
[02:14:48] of the departments and the team of the of the the assets that you have within your team but you
[02:14:54] you don't you can't get sucked into the details you have to stand back and and and
[02:14:58] and high-port you weapon to attach yourself and be the command control to make those big strategic decisions.
[02:15:08] Next question how easy or difficult do you find it to delegate command and control?
[02:15:17] It's really hard.
[02:15:18] Until you are totally overwhelmed and guess what in combat you're going to be overwhelmed I mean you
[02:15:29] can't do it all and it's and so anything in life is like this and so when you know you know
[02:15:35] as a political commander I have got two junior officers who are my assistant with the commanders and
[02:15:39] they've they don't have the experience I have it's their first opponent and my job is to train those
[02:15:45] guys up and yet so I've got to give them responsibility and teach them how to be able to
[02:15:50] commander and empower them and train them and mentor them I'm sure it was incredibly difficult
[02:15:55] in fact I know it was incredibly up for Jaco who had a lot of experience done a lot of direct action
[02:16:01] capture kill missions you know in Iraq to let me be a political commander go out and plan and
[02:16:07] run that stuff but you have to do that and and so you have to train people we always talk about
[02:16:13] how leaders have to work themselves out of a job that's what they should be doing they have you
[02:16:16] have to do that so that you're training the people underneath you to grow and learn and take
[02:16:22] on greater responsibility so that you can constantly look up and out of them you can grow
[02:16:26] and learn and take on greater responsibility.
[02:16:29] Yeah we talked about that a little bit too great I'm a delegation like
[02:16:33] but in my case the creative field where if I'm going to have someone to take care of some stuff it's
[02:16:37] hard to trust them to do it even though it's just in your own head because you're used to doing it
[02:16:43] this certain way and you even see that person doing it different even in that one way you're like
[02:16:48] oh you get all you know uneasy about it but how you were talking about how you give them a certain
[02:16:54] type of mission just like a you know you focus on that result and they know why they're doing it
[02:16:59] here's what here's what I want you to go out there and do yeah go out there and do it and I can't
[02:17:03] really get concerned on how you go out there and do it because you know in Ramadhi's a perfect example
[02:17:09] you know life had his element that was going out but there was multiple other elements that
[02:17:13] were going out in different parts of the city all the time and so I couldn't get in the weeds
[02:17:18] on the waves so I couldn't get in the weeds on the other four or five element commanders that
[02:17:21] were going out at certain times I mean all at the same times often and so I had to absolutely
[02:17:28] let go of it and let these guys make it happen now the reason I was able to do that was
[02:17:35] because we had built up trust I had put those guys through the wringer I had micro managed them
[02:17:41] and and just been a total um I don't know how would you describe it I mean when we first started
[02:17:47] work up I was really in the weeds with them like hey you know you kept tight reins you kept tight
[02:17:52] reins out of the gates so look this is how this is how you need to do it I wasn't telling them what
[02:17:56] to do but I was kept pushing them okay look what you did here think about this moving this direction
[02:18:01] a little bit you can't do that right there and and it didn't take long where the guys like okay
[02:18:06] they know what the expectations are they learn and now I now I don't have to worry about them so
[02:18:11] now what can I worry about now I can start worried about decinflection now I can worry about
[02:18:14] what the strategy is and you know for for bigger operations obviously when we were doing battalion
[02:18:19] not battalion size operations obviously I could go out there and coordinate with the battalions
[02:18:24] and and sometimes go out just to go out and make see how these guys are operating but I couldn't
[02:18:30] go out to with five different guys that five different elements at the same time or even two
[02:18:34] different elements at the same time and so you had to you have to build the trust and have the
[02:18:40] confidence in your leadership and then give them the guidance the parameters the expectations
[02:18:50] the goals make sure that's very clear and then you can let them go and you can let them run
[02:18:55] and you can do your job and that's how we rolled and and Jocco actually I mean I I remember this
[02:19:02] well because I knew that he wanted to be out on the battlefield with us on every single operation
[02:19:07] I mean that's just where he would choose to be and yet he saw his place is listen I've got
[02:19:12] man as these other elements and I remember a couple of times when I was like Jocco why don't
[02:19:16] you want to come on this up with us like go on this type of watch with us and you were like no
[02:19:22] I can't do that and even though I knew he wanted to do it he knew he had to you know whether it was
[02:19:26] approval plans for the other guys that were across the city or other elements that were out there
[02:19:31] doing those things that he understood what his role was and realized that if he was out there with me
[02:19:35] even though it had been fun he'd been getting gunned fights and and that was exactly where
[02:19:38] he wanted to be that he wouldn't be able to provide that support to some of the other guys and what
[02:19:42] they were doing and so so he couldn't do that and so it was I know that was incredible for you
[02:19:47] and it was the reasons that Laf knows that is almost as soon as we got there
[02:19:53] I said hey Laf I'm going out in the field for a little while you're gonna be
[02:19:57] tasked commander and I left him back and went out the seal so awesome and yet it was one of those
[02:20:03] things and I'll tell you that was that was actually one of the reasons why I did realize I couldn't
[02:20:09] go out as much as I would want to because I had to maintain command and control so like I said
[02:20:17] if it was a big operation where there was multiple units involved obviously I'd go out
[02:20:23] sometimes I would go out just to go out because you have to you know I always talk about this you can't
[02:20:27] be so far back in the rear that you don't know what the guys were doing through you know so I got
[02:20:31] to just go out there just to go out go over the regular go on some operation to start go out into the
[02:20:36] the one MC and go see what it's like up there but the fact of the matter is I had to be in the
[02:20:43] position to command and control and I had to kind of learn that out of the gate when I left
[02:20:48] Laf back at camp we had some significant operations happen and he got you know he got caught in the
[02:20:55] firestorm and I you know I wasn't where I should have been so I had to type myself up a little bit
[02:21:01] had to be more judicious in the way in the timing that I rolled out because it is hard to delegate
[02:21:08] it's hard to delegate especially not only do you want to do it but there's an element of
[02:21:17] you know pushing your kid out out out out out of the nest for the first time and you feel like
[02:21:25] I want to be there and want to make sure that this goes good and not that I didn't trust these
[02:21:29] guys not that they weren't perfectly fine on their own but no matter what these are your
[02:21:34] bros these are your buddies and you want to be there to make sure to give them everything that you
[02:21:40] can and so that's another little element of it that makes an art but you have no choice
[02:21:47] cool next question how do you overcome the handcuffing boss a boss who isn't a leader and doesn't
[02:21:54] trust his employees and he's a credit hog I know a little something about this jacco the credit
[02:22:02] jacco the credit hog handcuffing us didn't trust us you know not true at all that jacco was
[02:22:10] the opposite of that but this is listen the answer is pretty easy and this is something that
[02:22:15] jacco taught me because I have a hard time with this like you know somebody that if I'm more
[02:22:20] I'm one of those hard hit of guys that you know once they've just go accomplish the mission
[02:22:25] default aggressive let's get it done and if someone's preventing me from doing that or asking
[02:22:29] you a question that I think is even tangential I'm furious and frustrated at buy that and
[02:22:35] jacco had to kind of tighten me up a few times on that as they listen throttle back and
[02:22:42] you know you got really what that is it's just about putting your ego and check if you put your
[02:22:46] ego and check and you make that boss look good who cares who gets the credit for it it's about
[02:22:54] the mission and whether or not you're accomplished the mission and guess what if you go out and
[02:22:58] accomplish the mission the guy who's in charge is going to get the credit for regardless right so
[02:23:03] that's okay and you can't worry about that and there's the more you accomplish that mission
[02:23:08] the the credibility will be shared the the truth will be seen and and you're going to get you
[02:23:14] will read the rewards your team will read the rewards from that regardless of whether it's the
[02:23:19] overbearing boss are not who's trying to be the credit hog and so you just can't worry about
[02:23:23] that you have to put your ego and check you got to make your boss a good and you got to accomplish
[02:23:28] the mission the hand-cuffing boss the way you overcome the hand-cuffing boss is by building
[02:23:37] a relationship with them and I'll probably end up saying this on every podcast
[02:23:41] hmm I had the same relationship with every boss I ever had whether they were
[02:23:47] psychopathic micromanagers or whether they were tactical genius
[02:23:52] las a fair leaders I had the same relationship with all of them which was they trusted me
[02:23:57] they knew I was going to get the job done and they gave me what I needed that's what you're
[02:24:01] trying to accomplish and some people as life just pointed out you have to work harder to achieve that
[02:24:08] some people are less trusting some people are more more paranoid you're going to end up having to
[02:24:14] figure out these other human beings and that's what is hard about leadership especially up the
[02:24:20] chain of command so you've got to figure out this puzzle of a human being and you've got to
[02:24:24] get towards that strategic goal which is building a relationship of trust and once you have that
[02:24:31] the cuffs are going to get unlocked now the other piece the credit hog that
[02:24:39] life just talked about clearly clearly if you are saying to yourself he's taking all the credit and
[02:24:48] I'm not getting mine that's the red flag that's the alert saying hey brother your ego is calling
[02:24:58] you need to put it in check you like life said you want to make your boss look good there's nothing
[02:25:03] you can do better to build trust with your boss than make him look good and give him all the credit
[02:25:08] he's going to let you run those handcuffs are going to get a little looser every time you do that
[02:25:13] never cared about who got credit are you kidding me are you kidding me we're going to put that
[02:25:18] ahead of accomplishing the mission that we're here to a call to we're here to do no the credit doesn't
[02:25:23] matter give the credit your boss deliver it to your boss on a platter on a silver platter
[02:25:29] bringing that credit and walk away from it and say I'm going to go get you some more and those
[02:25:33] cuffs are going to come off make it happen just next question what do you do where you know
[02:25:43] in order is bad but if you don't fall in line the punishment will be terrible jacca you talked about this
[02:25:50] when you were reading the maximum Napoleon and I think the quote was something like every
[02:25:56] general and chief who in consequence of orders from his appears gives battle with a certain
[02:26:01] of defeat of his army's ruin is culpable and I think that's exactly true and what that really
[02:26:09] it means is extreme ownership you own it regardless and so you know in a military you've got the
[02:26:14] uniform code of mist military justice which is the the legal framework that the military
[02:26:21] falls underneath our laws our military justice system and you're you're obligated to not
[02:26:29] follow a illegal order so if someone gives you an order to go execute prisoners or do something
[02:26:35] that you shouldn't do you actually are legally obligated to not follow that and that following orders
[02:26:42] like you know whether you're it didn't work in Nuremberg right for the SS guard to set people to
[02:26:48] their death to say always just following orders it's not that is not a defense so you have to
[02:26:52] it's on you it's it's your responsibility and certainly under our own use to MJ it's it's on you
[02:26:59] and I think in those kind of situations you you have to own that if it's truly bad if it's truly
[02:27:04] catastrophic you have to be willing to take the punishment you want to punish me for that okay
[02:27:09] cool you want to fire me why I'm not going to do that because I'm going to sleep better at
[02:27:13] night knowing that I made the right decision I'm not going to go down this path that leads to
[02:27:17] you know the destruction of our team that puts people in harm's way that puts you know that
[02:27:21] causes people to do something that's unsafe and puts them in jeopardy and and you got to be
[02:27:26] able to stare yourself with the mirror and that's most important oh you want to fire me for that okay
[02:27:30] go I'll take that now some people you have to understand that you got to prioritize and there
[02:27:36] are those people that are like over the top everything is like you're telling me to do this and
[02:27:41] I don't agree with it and it's really not that big of a deal and one example I thought of
[02:27:47] people are shocked to hear about what it's like going to war in today's world the administrative
[02:27:54] requirements that are on you the massive amount of paperwork that we had to do just to get a
[02:27:58] approval for an operation all the things that we had to do better required on us and we're in the
[02:28:04] middle of a war and guess what we bitched and cried about that all the time no one more than me
[02:28:09] and jocke was probably sick and tired of hearing me about that and one of the things he sat right away
[02:28:13] was hey guess what all these admin requirements they're putting on us even though we're in the
[02:28:16] middle of a training right now they're asking us for this paperwork we're going to do them we're
[02:28:20] going to do them all all of them yeah and one of the reasons that I did that was because I did not
[02:28:26] want higher headquarters to have anything to hold over me at all and further more guess what I was
[02:28:32] doing I was building up myself a little relationship with the boss man because oh you want
[02:28:38] admin stuff done no problem don't even worry about it we're going to build it up that's what we're
[02:28:43] going to do and then there were times where the paperwork did cross the line and one of those situations
[02:28:52] that we ran into was not really a paperwork situation but they had they wanted us to work with
[02:29:00] Iraqi soldiers and talk about this before it's in the book the Iraqi soldiers are very unreliable
[02:29:07] unmotivated can be disloyal don't have good training don't speak the same language as us don't have
[02:29:12] good equipment I mean it's just a laundry list of reasons why you don't want to put your guys
[02:29:17] lives in their hands well in Ramadi the fighting was horrible in 2006 in other areas of Iraq the
[02:29:25] fighting had actually settled down well the command above us wanted us to work with Iraqi soldiers they
[02:29:32] wanted all the special operations people to work with Iraqi soldiers so they actually and and the
[02:29:37] all of the special operations people mostly were resistant to this and so everyone would kind of
[02:29:43] skate by and figure out how to not do it I'm going to take I'm going to take a 25 man element of
[02:29:48] US special operators and we'll take three Iraqis with us just to just to kind of check them off right
[02:29:54] and you could see why they were doing this you know why because it's safer it's it's a way they're
[02:29:58] okay we're doing what you said and they were actually using the term Iraqi face we're going to put
[02:30:02] an Iraqi face on this mission which to them literally meant one face in subcases so we get told this
[02:30:08] as well and if you you know if you read the book we'll talk we talk about the fact that yeah we were
[02:30:14] definitely not pro taking Iraqis but we realized that if we didn't do that if we didn't get the
[02:30:20] Iraqis out there fighting they were never going to learn how to fight and we were never
[02:30:24] able to leave Iraq so we knew that something we had to do but then they went one step further
[02:30:30] and they set up a ratio and I know this sounds crazy they set up a ratio and they said I think
[02:30:35] it was for every one American soldier you have to have five Iraqi soldiers with you it was
[02:30:40] some ratio like that some number and if you were out in some part of central Iraq outside of a
[02:30:49] small town and you were doing some kind of a simple mission you could get away with that all day long
[02:30:54] in Romadi wasn't happened that would have meant I would have been sending three or four seals
[02:31:00] out with twenty something Iraqis and that means if there's a firefight you got three guys that are
[02:31:06] alive both once you'll get hit who else is going to handle things it's a nightmare and so this order
[02:31:12] came down and I just ran up the chain of commands said we can't do that and we're not going to do
[02:31:19] that here is what we're taking we'll take as many Iraqis as appropriate but this is the minimum
[02:31:25] force we're going to have every operation that we go on and so we set that standard and of course
[02:31:30] and this is something I talk about a lot as well it was a sensible argument it made sense there
[02:31:38] was obviously casualties on a regular basis in the Romadi there were fire fights every single day
[02:31:43] the buttoon out in correct or their first twenty four missions in a row they got in a firefight
[02:31:48] twenty four missions in a row they got in a firefight then they had one day where they didn't
[02:31:51] and then the next day they did it again for another how were many missions so there were fire fights
[02:31:55] happening on every mission so for us to be like okay yeah we'll just bring three seals and 15 Iraqi
[02:32:01] soldiers it's a nightmare we're all going to get killed if we do that but one of the reasons that
[02:32:06] that we were able to do that the jacco was able to get approval for that is because
[02:32:10] all the little stuff that all you know other people it's like oh we don't want to do this
[02:32:14] paperwork that's too much and they complain we had done that we had done those little things
[02:32:19] yeah it's a pain for us yet do I want to do that of course not I'd rather be trying to do
[02:32:22] another stuff but we're going to do it and so because jacco had had set that standard and we
[02:32:27] made it happen then when we really push back for the stuff that really mattered which is what I was
[02:32:31] talking about you got to prioritize an execute prioritize the stuff that really matters we were able
[02:32:36] to get that approval guess what they didn't want to go out and get killed so is what we explained
[02:32:40] it up the chain of like listen if we do that we're going to we're going to get a lot of guys
[02:32:44] killed by doing that and I talk about this often the fact that leadership is aligned to the front
[02:32:52] troops and if not then there's something drastic wrong but of course my boss is wanted me to
[02:32:58] keep my guys safe and kill back guys and when the war of course they did it in an
[02:33:01] in businesses of course the boss wants you to be profitable and keep your troops happy but be
[02:33:08] profitable be ethical right that those are standard things and those are going to be aligned so if you
[02:33:14] send up an idea up the chain of commander you get told to do something and you don't do it because
[02:33:18] it's not going to help you be profitable why would your boss disagree with that it's not going to
[02:33:23] happen so you have to have the the wherewithal to actually know when to say no and on the moral
[02:33:33] and ethical things that Dave talked about those are clear cut those are clear cut if you're
[02:33:39] getting told to do something that's illegal or ill moral then it is your duty and responsibility
[02:33:45] to disobey that order and that's the way it is all right last question my team has missed our last
[02:34:02] two deadlines I want to take ownership but I'm not sure how it's not what you preach it's what you
[02:34:15] tolerate and look you have to you have to be effective we talk about there's two there's only
[02:34:22] two measures that really that matter and that's effective and ineffective are you effective or
[02:34:28] you accomplish in the mission and if you are figure out a way to become even more effective
[02:34:34] if you're ineffective you're not accomplish in the mission then you got to figure it out you
[02:34:38] got to take ownership of that you got to solve that problem so if your team is getting the job done
[02:34:46] you can't tolerate less than that you have as a leader you have to drive those standards
[02:34:53] I learned pretty early on that in the seal teams there's some strong personalities there
[02:35:01] which is awesome that's one of the great things about the seal teams and there's always this tension
[02:35:06] between people have there my we should do it this way we should do it this way we should train this
[02:35:13] heart we should focus here there and and that's also be have some incredibly talented great
[02:35:19] guys as we've just talked about but as a leader you have got to maintain the standards and
[02:35:29] there's some there are standards that just cannot be compromised you've got to push hard you've
[02:35:38] got to drive that performance you got to set the tone for that and if you don't do that no one's
[02:35:43] going to do it so it's not what you preach it's not the words that you say it's not
[02:35:51] the email that you sent it's not the banner that you created to put on the wall or the power
[02:35:56] point slides that you built it's actually what you tolerate it's the performance that you see and if it's
[02:36:03] substandard you got to push again and you get to push again you get to set that bar high
[02:36:10] now that being said you can't drive your team in the ground you have to lead them
[02:36:16] you can't be a slave driver you can't destroy your team you can't be overbearing
[02:36:21] but for that those things that really matter pushing performance to the next level you have
[02:36:27] got to set that standard and I think that's what makes truly the best military units the best
[02:36:34] teams out there great it's now what you preach it's what you tolerate and with that one thing I
[02:36:48] like to think about when when I hear about standards and what you're going to tolerate
[02:36:59] don't just think about your team you got to think about yourself you got to think about raising
[02:37:08] the bar on yourself you got to think about what you're going to tolerate from yourself
[02:37:14] and how you can raise that bar and raise that standard and get better with everything you do
[02:37:25] and thereby lead by example so that your team becomes the example
[02:37:34] and with that I think will close it out that was a long haul on the podcast
