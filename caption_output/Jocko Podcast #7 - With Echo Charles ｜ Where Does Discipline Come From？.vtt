00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is Jockel Podcast number seven with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willinger.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Ambush of dominating patrol at Niedon Keene.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Niedon Keene is a small village in the midst of the jungles, and its extensive clear patches were developing as farms.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The village had a couple of rice mills close for a long time, a school, a dispensary, and a small market next to the school.

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The market was itself a road junction with houses and huts around.

6
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Northeastern the market, a couple kilometers away, was the post of the IPKF held in strength.

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
North of the market was upon its rising embankment facing the post.

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It had become necessary to dominate Niedon Keene by day, as well as night at the height of operations in 88 and early 89.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Thereafter, dominating the market became a routine, and a gospel for the next battalion, since the relieved battalion in its handing over notes had mentioned the same.

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So the new battalion got into the rut and carried on without once asking why this action was necessary.

11
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So much so that the new units dominating patrols even occupied the same trenches in the same fashion for the same period and checked the population in the same manner.

12
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:56.000
One change it made was to stop occupying the double, the only double story building in the bizarre, and instead occupy only the ground level trenches in the midst of the market.

13
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The second change was to stop searching the nearby school and other buildings, where trenches and bunkers were made, thoroughly before occupying them.

14
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The third change over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance in the market, school and other buildings.

15
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The battalion for months had not been involved in any kind of encounter, not even caught or seen a mouse.

16
00:02:33.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So this is setting the stage and I'm reading from a book called Assignment, Jaffna, which is about the war, the long civil war, you know, small country called Sri Lanka, and it's written by a lieutenant general, sardish pande, who was a commander there on the ground.

17
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And what's interesting about this book is a very rare book.

18
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In fact, I after I picked it up and started reading through it, and I figured other people might want to get it.

19
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I looked on Amazon and it's a rare book that you have to buy from individual buyers.

20
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And the reason that I have it is because I bought it on the ground in Sri Lanka. In the 90s, when I was attached to a seal unit that went to Sri Lanka to help train the Sri Lankan soldiers to fight against the Tamil Tigers, which was an insurgent terrorist group.

21
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Called the LTT, the liberation tigers of Tamil, Ilam. It is an ethnic group that lived in Sri Lanka and had been mistreated and had now wanted their own state.

22
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So this opening of this book, or the opening of the chapter that I just read about this ambushes, catches a couple things that I think are very important.

23
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Number one, you heard me say that the new battalion got into this rut and carried on with this mission without once asking why it was necessary.

24
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I think this is very important for everybody to remember that when you get tasked with something, you need to ask why you're doing it.

25
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You need to understand why you're doing something. Don't just carry on because it's the way it's always been done. Ask that question why. And one of the things that I learned a very hard lesson on.

26
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000
On my first deployment to Iraq, we would get, you know, we'd get a target that would come down the chain and they'd tell us, hey, there's a bad guy in this building.

27
00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And we would literally get a map of some area of Iraq or Baghdad or some city in Iraq like Baghdad. And on the map, there would literally like a like a cheesy movie.

28
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
There would be a red X on the target building.

29
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And that would be the building. And we'd go out and hit it. And I remember one time we did an operation.

30
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And we went and took down this target, the building that had the big red X on it, and got the guy that we thought was a bad guy.

31
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And anyways, to make a long story short, when we got the person back.

32
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And we interrogated him and went through the intelligence that we had taken from the house.

33
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It turned up that guy was not a bad guy. He was just a guy that had been, you know, somehow mixed up with something that ended up giving us this quote unquote intelligence.

34
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And so from then on, and as I dug, as I pulled the thread on the red X, I figured out that, you know, just someone had had three houses to choose from.

35
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And for whatever reason, put the axe on that house. They had no real intelligence behind it.

36
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And so I always would tell the story to the young seals and say, you know, find out who put the axe on the target building.

37
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And make sure that there's a damn good reason why they put that red X there.

38
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So it's also going back to the paragraph that I started with, is you could see that these guys were occupying the same trenches, the same fashion, the same period, and the same manner.

39
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So they are definitely locked into a pattern that is going to cost them dearly. And it goes on to talk about the only changes they did make some changes, but all the changes were negative.

40
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
All the changes were wrong. For instance, they did not occupy the one double story building.

41
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Now anyone that knows anything about tactics knows that you want to take the high ground.

42
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You always want to have the high ground. And here they were in this bizarre, and they didn't take the one double story building.

43
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So when you're in a two story building and everything else is a one story building, it gives you, you can see much further. It's a dominating position.

44
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
You can shoot up, shoot people much easier.

45
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And so you have to take the high ground. And there's a seal that I know that kind of took that thought.

46
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And he had a great quote, which was, take the high ground or the high ground will take you.

47
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And you know, when I talk to people about moral or ethical issues, I use that very quote.

48
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Take the high ground or the high ground will take you. So you know, stay on the straight and narrow path.

49
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So going back to this.

50
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
On a routine round of the days morning activity, a patrol of about 20.

51
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Got out of the post at Daybreak, and pulled along the road to the rice mill, entered the market,

52
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000
dispersed into the different trenches and bunkers, got into them and started the days dominating work.

53
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And this term dominating basically means they're going to go out in control of the area.

54
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That's what this term is referring to when they use this term dominating.

55
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Majority the trenches were in the were joining the school premises.

56
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The school was closed as it was a holiday.

57
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Doors and windows were locked from the outside.

58
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Attendance in the market was thin.

59
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Some shops had not opened.

60
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Normally they should have.

61
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So if you remember earlier, it says the third change over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance.

62
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
In the market.

63
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So it's like the Scooby-Doo old Scooby-Doo cartoon.

64
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Where, you know, they say, oh, it's quiet a little too quiet.

65
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And that's exactly what this is.

66
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And this is something that we would see in Ramadi, you'd see the streets clear out.

67
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Because the local populace would know somehow that there was an attack that was imminent.

68
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Around breakfast, all hell broke loose.

69
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
The doors and windows of the school suddenly opened fire and started.

70
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And started incoming into the trenches and bunkers in front almost at point blank range.

71
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Thereafter grenades were thrown into the trenches.

72
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000
As those few outside the school tried to react, the militants occupying the double story building brought murderous fire on them below.

73
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Every movement was picked up.

74
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
The two-inch mortar detachment which had stayed off and was still behind across the school was only,

75
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
was the only element not hit or engaged.

76
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It quickly got behind some covering fired a few bombs.

77
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Then they too were picked up.

78
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Barely a few managed to get behind some building on the other side and kept a disultry volley of shots.

79
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It was all over in the market.

80
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But not on its outskirts.

81
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So now you have these guys that had been in these positions and clearly the insurgents had set up on them completely and just unleashed in moments had them gunned down.

82
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The post, so the post is where these guys had patrolled to this market from.

83
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The post reacted quickly and sent a relief patrol directly to the school through open patty fields.

84
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The militants had correctly anticipated it.

85
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
As you can imagine, the militants knew exactly where the post was.

86
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
They knew when they hit these guys that they would send reinforcements.

87
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Here come the reinforcements. They're ready.

88
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
They gave a searing welcome to the relief party and pinned it to the ground.

89
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The post mortars had been deployed and fired on the bund of the Kalam, which dominating heights of the militants had a mobilized relief column.

90
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The militants seemed to be enjoying it as they pumped automatic fire into the post itself from the nearby jungle edge.

91
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Although this fire was more in the nature of a gesture of defiance.

92
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So they not only were hitting the market, but they had coordinated that when the market, when they started to attack the shri-long, or sorry, the Indian soldiers in the market.

93
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
As soon as they started that, then when that reaction force came from the post, they hit the post as well.

94
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
As quickly as they had half an hour later, the militants stopped firing.

95
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:36.000
As quickly as they had started it and melted away with the booty of weapons from more than a dozen killed and wounded soldiers of the dominating patrol.

96
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So obviously a horrific situation.

97
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And this is where the general asks some questions, some poignant questions.

98
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What kind of training had this battalion done?

99
00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000
What manner of mental, additunal, professional preparation headed achieved before being inducted into the battlefield in Sri Lanka?

100
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What attention did its previous brigade and divisional commanders give the training and attuning it before dispatching it to Sri Lanka?

101
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Surely it was forced to keep doing its station duties, providing working parties for golf courses, clubs, sports events, and other peacetime activities senseless.

102
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So what he's saying there is that while this force was back in India, instead of training, what they were doing was helping with golf events and taking care of the local sporting events.

103
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
That they were doing, helping with the clubs, cleaning up.

104
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They weren't training for war, which is what they should have been doing.

105
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And that's the domination squad.

106
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
That's the domination squad.

107
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Yeah, this is the guy, they were not ready.

108
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Where the CO stood up, resisted peacetime demands, made by selfish, peace-oriented,

109
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
brigade and divisional commanders and trained their men.

110
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
They and their units did well.

111
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
They saved on casualties and sought the enemy.

112
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So he's saying that the commanding officers back in India that stood up and said,

113
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Look, we're not going to manage the golf game.

114
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We're not going to go clean up the club over there.

115
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
We're going to train for war.

116
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Those guys did well.

117
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Where newly inducted units failed and senselessly suffered, the blame must squarely and entirely fall on the unprofessional,

118
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
indifferent brigade and divisional commanders from whose formations such units came as reliefs in Sri Lanka.

119
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It was a breach of faith all along, so painfully, so very painfully callous and unprofessional,

120
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
even as late as the beginning of 1989.

121
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So you had this, the IPK, which is the Indian peacekeeping force, who has really fought in all kinds of different wars all over the world.

122
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But they had been sent in to Sri Lanka to try and coel the violence between the Sri Lankan government and the LTT.

123
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And they, first of all, they thought they were going to be getting, they thought they were going to be in a peacekeeping mission.

124
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And they ended up not being, I mean, they ended up being on a peacekeeping mission, but they ended up in serious combat with,

125
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
with the two of the tigers.

126
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So it's, these questions that he asks, you know, what kind of training did they have, what attention was paid,

127
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
these are things that if you're in a leadership position, you should be asking yourself,

128
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
what position are you putting your people into and how well have you trained them for it?

129
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And if you have not trained them for it, then you need to train them for it.

130
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And also assessing where you are going to end up.

131
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And this is something that when I was running training in the SEAL teams, I was always training guys for the worst case scenario.

132
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
In fact, we would do, we would set up operations where we'd tell them, okay, you're just going to go and meet with the local tribal leader,

133
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and we'd have actors that were going to play the local tribal leader.

134
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And we just want you to go in there and drink tea with them and try and gather some information from them.

135
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And so there you go, okay, and if they didn't prepare properly, they would get destroyed.

136
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Because of course, we lower them in and say, oh, yes, the tribal leader is ready to meet with you.

137
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Oh, great.

138
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Lower them into the room and then all of a sudden you take that guy hostage, you kill him and then you start.

139
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So he'd cause total man, but the point was you always had to prepare for the worst case scenario.

140
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And that's obviously not something that happened here.

141
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I'm going into another ambush.

142
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
It was a good unit.

143
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Had trained and prepared well before coming into Sri Lanka in late 1988.

144
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It had well taped up drills, the unit, and subunit commanders planned their operations as innovatively as circumstances permitted.

145
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And took pains to avoid routine. So these guys were a little bit sharper.

146
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
One of the biggest things you need to watch out for in a combat situation is routine and doing the same thing over and over again and giving a pattern of life that people can recognize and take advantage of.

147
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So these guys were trying to avoid that.

148
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They're one slip-up was that they did not take enough pains to detect the setting in of routine and inclination to find comfort and slackness.

149
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So that means they did a good job when they were fresh.

150
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000
But once they started feeling tired, they would slip into routine and they'd slip into slackness.

151
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Like complacency.

152
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Complacency.

153
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
As a newly inducted unit, the men were alert up and about keen and for a long time nothing happened.

154
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And this is something that people try to express about combat but combat is often a lot of waiting.

155
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And sometimes they picture this. Sometimes they portray this well and the better in the better movies about combat.

156
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
They show these long periods of waiting and that can be what combat is.

157
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And what's happening here is this unit is there.

158
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And for a long time nothing's happening. So when nothing happens, you start to get more and more complacent.

159
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:49.000
In mid-May 1989, on a day when the road to elephant pass had to be opened by the unit.

160
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
One of the posts and route detailed it's platoon to ensure security of a stretch of road for a distance of about two kilometers.

161
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Lippel-tune split into four parties of six to seven men each.

162
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And set out to search the road physically and secure an area stride to it a distance of 300 to 500 meters within its given beat.

163
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Having cleared the roads, these parties established squads 300 to 400 meters away from the road from where they could observe the road stretch and the area strided.

164
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
At varying intervals, one squad was to move out and relieve the next one and so forth.

165
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
The chain would of relief would go. Sometimes clockwise, sometimes anti-clockwise.

166
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000
This was to overcome boredom of void routine and keep mobile at add times and thus dominate the stretch.

167
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
So what they're doing is they've got their little squad set up and then occasionally one squad would go move to another squad's position.

168
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And that squad would go to another squad's position.

169
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
So they would just do that to keep moving, keep mobile, not get complacent.

170
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
The road had been kept open for the whole day for up and down convoy.

171
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So they had to keep this road open because they were running convoy's to another area.

172
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
A Jason to the road ran the railway line too, over which that day two trains were to run.

173
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
It would be a long day as all such road rail opening days were.

174
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So this is kind of a common mission for them to secure these roads and these railroad tracks to get convoy's through to bring logistical supplies to other parts of the military.

175
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000
The platoon secured the area and saw the convoy and the trains through by about 1030.

176
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
So 1030 the morning, they'd gone by.

177
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
They would now have to wait for the returning convoy and trains in the afternoon.

178
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
The sun was well up in the sky and the men were being baked.

179
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Humidity added to the discomfort.

180
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
It was time for the squads to get up and move out to relieve the next one.

181
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Number one and number two squads were north of the T junction about 405 meters, 500 meters away from it.

182
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Number four and three squads were opposite.

183
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
One and two respectively south of the road.

184
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Number one squad, however, over a period had quietly decided to reduce this distance and establish itself next to the T junction in a thick coconut grove, which had good shade.

185
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So there's that opportunity instead of baking out in the sun, we're just going to kind of get a little bit closer to the road,

186
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
get a little bit closer to the T junction, we're going to sit in some shade.

187
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
The squad occupied the grove as it had been doing and relaxed against the trees.

188
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It was comprised of six men.

189
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
They did not feel the necessity of posting centuries.

190
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
No guards were out.

191
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
The militants had noticed this routine, so this whole time they're being observed.

192
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And you know, that's something you've always got to expect, you've always got to expect that you're being watched.

193
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:18.000
About 15-mm militants with weapons slowly drove a vehicle to the T junction and went on dropping a few members at four or five places around,

194
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
I'm sorry, across the branch road, opposite the Honolert squad barely 40 meters away.

195
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Then they occupied a few old trenches dug by the IPKF during the previous year.

196
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
So here are these guys basically asleep and sitting in this coconut grove and 40 meters away.

197
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I mean, you played football, 40 less than half a football field away, you've got the insurgents getting in position.

198
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Is it indicating that they were doing that on purpose?

199
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Like, that was their tactic to lollum to sleep a little bit?

200
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Or is it just kind of just sheer complacency on the right thing that I think I don't think I had a weight along the sleep?

201
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I'm sure that they were watching this area, I'm sure that this was an area that they had done this mission before.

202
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And so they probably sat there and watched them do this three or four or five or ten times in the past.

203
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And when these guys were a state alert, then they wouldn't attack them.

204
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
They just watched and waited and finally one day they see them.

205
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
It's a hot day, they go down and watch, they see them getting complacent.

206
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
They move into position.

207
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Yeah, so it's not like they were waiting as a tactic, like let's not do anything and create this feeling of inactivity.

208
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So they go to sleep, just have that happen to get.

209
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
But I bet you're there in the kitchen.

210
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And over and over again, and every time that that squad was alert, they just said, okay, we're not going to hit them.

211
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
You know, we used to say that about when we were driving on my first deployment to Iraq and we'd be driving around in our homies with no armor on them.

212
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
We would say, look, our protection is that we're going to look alert. We're going to have our guns scanning.

213
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000
We're going to be everyone's going to have a gun pointed at the, you know, at a target somewhere, wherever you think would be a target.

214
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
So that if an surgeon is going to attack us, they're going to look at us and say, you know what, let's wait till a little less aggressive convoy came through.

215
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And it usually worked.

216
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And we only got to ambush a few times.

217
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And so to generally, I assume that that work well for us, considering how often ambushes were happening.

218
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Yeah.

219
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Around 1100, around 1100 hours, all of them poured bullets into the resting squad, not one remained alive, not one could fire back.

220
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Thus, just then the number four squad, which had up, which had upstocked from its location, south of the main road and was going to number one's location to relieve it.

221
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Endered into the inferno.

222
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
The opening volley of the militants who were watching caught and killed four of this party too and wounded the other two.

223
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Just as they were entering the grove.

224
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Out of these two, once come soon, but the other who survived, froze, took no further part, perhaps fainting death and survived.

225
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Hearing this firing, the number three squad, which was about a kilometer away, rushed in very fast.

226
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And was at the site in less than 10 minutes, even as the militants were still firing.

227
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
The number two squad also reached the site, a little north, simultaneously, to engage the retreating militants.

228
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:50.000
This promptness was good, but was not, but what was not was that the two groups having connected or having contacted and exchanged fire with the militants at that site did not pursue the militants and allow them a clean break.

229
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:03.000
So these other two squads, when the firing started, they rushed in from two different directions and actually weren't a good position to do some big damage to the militants.

230
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
But they didn't.

231
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It is all the more regrettable because the two parties had contacted the militants from two directions and were thus in a position of considerable advantage.

232
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Instead, all of them converged on the site and started getting hold of the dead and wounded.

233
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
So instead of attacking, they all just converged on the guys that were dead and wounded and started taking care of them.

234
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
But losses amounted to 10 killed and one wounded, the militants suffered one dead.

235
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So again, a horrible situation.

236
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:56.000
The glaring example of cross complacency on the part of our brave soldiers, who neither firmly adhere to the spirit and content of basic tactical teaching, nor thinks it's necessary to use that little brain God has given.

237
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Our teaching and officering methods make sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop a guyel.

238
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So what he's saying is the way that they train these troops and how they treat them, they get them so that they don't use their brain.

239
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
They don't use their brain.

240
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And that's something that we've talked about on this podcast multiple times.

241
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And then we're going automatically.

242
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
No, to try and make sure that the training that you do expands your brain and makes you think.

243
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I told quite a few stories about how my goal when I was running training was to put these guys in situations where the only way out was to use their brain.

244
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Not to use their physical skills, not to use the tactics that they already knew.

245
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:06.000
They're not going to use their training that had been embedded into their brain, but to think of their own solution to a problem.

246
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:20.000
You know, when you, when you, this I can jujitsu, when you see someone that is really masterful in jujitsu, that person that you consider that is the person that you see get into a position and they do something completely unexpected.

247
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000
That kind of training that I want to do for people to put them in positions where they have to do something that's unexpected and new and that they created.

248
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Nobody from the patrol could be punished.

249
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Those who made the mistake were already dead.

250
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
It's a damn shame.

251
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:58.000
So to talk a little bit about this book, this book, as I said, it's called a assignment, Jaffna by Sardish Pandey, Lieutenant General Sardish Pandey.

252
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
And here's his opening to the book.

253
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
And I think this is one of the most honest openings to a book I've ever heard.

254
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:15.000
This book is an attempt to present to the reader an account of Operation Pawan, our considerable endeavor on military diplomatic,

255
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
political front in Sri Lanka from 1987 to 1989, a period of over two and a half years.

256
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And this is where I think this guy is just beautifully honest.

257
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I lay no claim to scholarship and research on the subject.

258
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Nor have I had ready at hand documentary back up to substantiate my remarks and conclusions.

259
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
I have not attempted to consult others who were closer to the decision makers or even the decision making process itself.

260
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I kept no notes, no diaries, not even compared notes with my peers, colleagues or subordinates.

261
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
With my seniors, I had the normal all-too-human quota of professional animus.

262
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I did my job as I understood, perceived it or sorry, perceived and fought it appropriate.

263
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
In my post-retirement glow, I simply reminisced.

264
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Memories researched as I did so, not always with precise contextual precision perhaps, but with sufficient clarity to heat up illuminate and see through this effort.

265
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And this is something that I went whenever I'm the books that have always kind of hit me in the books that we've used in this podcast are these books that I find value in,

266
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
and that's the books with kind of unaltered thoughts and it's usually coming from the person itself.

267
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:51.000
That's one thing that automatically gives me a negative impression or not a negative impression, but I love hearing it the voice of the person that did it.

268
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
I want to hear from that person.

269
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
As soon as you interpret it, as soon as someone else's interpret it, you know it's getting spun somewhere another.

270
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Intentionally or not, there's a different viewpoint. And this is something that I used to when we were running training or when I was running training,

271
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
and you'd have a guy do something.

272
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.000
You'd have a guy coming to a room, and this is just a training operation, but you'd have a guy coming to a room and there'd be a doorway or a prisoner or a hostage.

273
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And they would do something dumb or crazy or wrong.

274
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
But, you know, some guys would say, you know, go and do it again. You know, go and do that again.

275
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And although we would definitely make them do it again, I would always make them deal with what they did, because they did whatever their instincts told them to do.

276
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And what your instincts told them to, guess what, your instincts were wrong. Now you still have to deal with it.

277
00:30:44.000 --> 00:31:00.000
So I like these guys that talk about what they did, and as you can see from those first two stories, this guy's talking about what they did wrong, what happened bad, and his assessment of why.

278
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I'm going to continue.

279
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:13.000
It is the account of the happenings as seen through the eyes of a divisional commander who in war, in my opinion, in experience, is the main link between strategy and tactics.

280
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And the main difference between perception and insight.

281
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:32.000
So he's in a good position. He's kind of seeing what was, you know, how that strategy of what the goal was, how that got interpreted into the ground.

282
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
There are others who cherish macro level viewing and tend to underrate ground realities.

283
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:57.000
This is another thing that I always look for. Now of course, I'm interested in what the general say, absolutely. I'm always interested in what the president say, or what the, the prime minister says, and how the general's took that, and what they did with it, and those broad strategies, I'm very interested in that. I always want to read about that.

284
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And in what he's saying, there's others that cherish the macro level viewing, which is what that is, the generals, and tend to underrate the ground realities, and I agree with him.

285
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
I belong to the former category.

286
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Mine was termed a worm's view, and I preferred it that way, meaning he is the guy that was on the ground, and this is what he saw, as if he was a worm on the ground.

287
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
How on the ground he was, I knew exactly where I stood.

288
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000
It is this that produced considerable disillusionment, friction, and differences with superior headquarters and planners.

289
00:32:42.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Once again, this is something that I always find intriguing when you get these guys, these soldiers, people like Hackworth, people that are dedicated, you know, lifelong military members, and they get this twist of disillusionment and suspicion against their higher headquarters.

290
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:24.000
I'm not shouting myself horse, but the juggernaut rolled on unheating. So despite this guy's protests and talking and trying to explain the juggernaut rolled on unheating.

291
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:39.000
There's a school of thought, which says that mistakes were bound to be made in the complex and undertaking of projecting power outside our national geographic confines, and that these have to be taken and stride.

292
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So yeah, hey look, we're going to have mistakes, they're going to happen, we just have to deal with them and move on.

293
00:33:46.000 --> 00:34:02.000
My intention is that if we consider ourselves professional soldiers and experts in concerned fields, then there was no need to and no excuse for committing most of these mistakes.

294
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:24.000
After all, it was human lives and limbs which were being lost. We know we have an abundance of manpower, even cheap human lives in this country, but that does not give us the power of attorney to waste them.

295
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:45.000
And I think that's a sediment that anybody that's been on the front lines can understand is that it's easy to write those checks from the government or from the re-eraśual on or from the safe place.

296
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:59.000
But those checks that you're writing are human lives and no one should write that check without a heavy burden on their mind.

297
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:24.000
There is a good deal of eye in the narration. It is not so much because of my ego to show up myself or to put others always in the dock, but simply because it is a compilation of what eye as a cog in the gigantic wheel saw felt perceived and got influenced by.

298
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:41.000
I think it's interesting that this guy is saying, look, the books about me and I apologize and I'm not trying to be e-cautistical and actually in reading that right now, I know that on multiple discussions that I've had about the book that lay for me I wrote, we're doing the same thing.

299
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:53.000
We're like, look, it's not, you know, sorry, we're not. It's not about us, it's about what we learned and I think he's trying to make the same statement there.

300
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Sri Lanka was a fascinating assignment, the most challenging of my life, the most tense, the most rewarding.

301
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I think that anybody that's been in tense combat will tell you that's the most rewarding thing that they will do in their life.

302
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I am grateful to my colleagues, subordinates, peers, and our magnificent men, steady, solid as they are.

303
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I have a high regard for the LTT for its discipline, dedication, determination, motivation, and technical expertise.

304
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
So there he is, he's talking about the enemy and you've heard me say it on here is you have to respect your enemy and there he is.

305
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000
He is high regard for the LTT and its discipline and dedication and determination and motivation and their technical expertise.

306
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
That's everything.

307
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:03.000
But find little justification in its senseless, malicious, destructive insistence on continuation of military means in the search of an honorable solution to the Tamile problem in Sri Lanka.

308
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Any goes on, I think some of my earns-twall subordinates for helping me refresh my memory.

309
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Most of them took me seriously in war and remained two steps ahead of me in their spheres.

310
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
God bless them.

311
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:32.000
So, like me looking at the guys that worked with me and for me, I hold them in the highest regard for taking care of me.

312
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Then he's saying the same thing.

313
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Fashion apart, I genuinely feel I must dedicate this personal account to the young officer, the young soldiers, and the Jaffton Tamiles who made me a good soldier and a better human being in my own eyes.

314
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
I think that's just an outstanding opening for a book.

315
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Now, getting into the tactics.

316
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000
On their arrival, he goes on to say, our tactics were predetermined, straight-jacketed, predictable and reactive.

317
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
These rows only a little above what is known as minor tactics in military terminology.

318
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
That is tactical arrangement and drills at section-in-putoon level.

319
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Counter-insurgency operations demanded far more innovative and integrative formulations at company, battalion, and formation levels.

320
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
This is obviously something that we had to deal with in Ramadi.

321
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And that was this idea of counter-insurgency.

322
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:54.000
It's so, it's infinitely more complex than a situation where two uniformed military groups are fighting against each other.

323
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Everything is clear. It's very easy to understand.

324
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
They have a different shaped helmet. They have a different colored uniform.

325
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And we're going to get on our different sides of the lines and we're going to go and destroy them.

326
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And an insurgency is just infinitely more complex.

327
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:18.000
People mixed in with the populist, the populist swaying back and forth on who they support, wanting to protect the populist from the insurgence.

328
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Some of the populists supporting the insurgence and some of the populists supporting the host nation or the friendlies.

329
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
It's just an infinitely more complex situation.

330
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.000
How he explains it. Counter-insurgency remains essentially a company in Patoon commander's battle task.

331
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So he's saying that it is those front-line guys that are actually going to make it happen.

332
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
However, he goes on.

333
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
They're concerted, integrated, mutually responsive and interconnected employment.

334
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
The man's particularized tactics at battalion and brigade levels.

335
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:10.000
And what that means is that the person who's overall in charge has got to do an outstanding job of explaining what the mission is and explaining how it's connected and explaining how what is going to happen on the front-line is going to affect the broad strategy.

336
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Getting that commander's intent down to the front-line is critical. This is something that when I was in Ramadi and I was working for Colonel Sean McFarlane, who's now General McFarlane, who is just an unbelievably outstanding leader.

337
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:35.000
But he was able to get his intent from him to the battalions, to the companies, to the platoons, to the squads and right down to the front-line leadership.

338
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Very similar situation that Colonel McFarlane was able to execute in a just an outstanding way.

339
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.000
So now we get to beyond the strategy or beyond the tactics.

340
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And as we talked about on the last podcast, what always interests me more is the principles of war.

341
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
And how different people in different situations see those principles.

342
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000
And how those principles of war can be translated into principles of life.

343
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And principles of business and principles of fighting and principles of relationships and everything that you're doing.

344
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And really also the principles of the war within and the war that we have within ourselves to beat back the insurgents that are in our mind.

345
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:47.000
You know, being back the emotions that are in our mind that are trying to make us weak and trying to bring us down and trying to keep us from being the best that we can be.

346
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000
So those principles of war apply to so many different things and that's why I find them so fascinating.

347
00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:04.000
And luckily enough, the good general has a section that's called principles of war.

348
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Principles of war distilled from conventional warfare are well known, but their degree of relevance in insurgency wars is not the same.

349
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Again, we're talking about insurgency much more complex.

350
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Insurgency is total war in the sense that involves people too in an intimate and positive manner.

351
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Employees all sinews of war, political, social, economic, psychological, diplomatic and military.

352
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:47.000
It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals.

353
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
It eggs, I'm going to read that again, echo. I'm not sure you got it.

354
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals.

355
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:05.000
So what you're trying to achieve in an insurgency, in a counterinsurgency situation is so hard to achieve.

356
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
It is so difficult to achieve.

357
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Insurgency is an unrelenting, low intensity, long-drawn war with time and opportunity serving the interests of the insurgency.

358
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
And wherein the insurgency designs to overcome his weakness in one's fear with strength in the others.

359
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So in an insurgency, they don't have tanks, but they have time and they can wait you out and they can just pick away it to you.

360
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
The death of a thousand cuts. That's what the fear is.

361
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
That's how the insurgency is going to win.

362
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Is the death of a thousand cuts.

363
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And when I think about me or you or us as individuals,

364
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
it's those little things. It's those little cuts. It's those little times.

365
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
It's those little situations where you cut yourself a little bit of slack.

366
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And that's the insurgency winning. That's the insurgency beating you.

367
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So the principles themselves relentless pursuance of the aim.

368
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.000
The TTE was clear in its aim and unrelenting in its pursuit.

369
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Elam and political settlement on its terms.

370
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Elam was the name that they wanted to give the state for the the timbles.

371
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:50.000
And that was their clear aim with no, no other possible modifications that they wanted their own state period.

372
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
On the other hand, we were not very clear about our aim.

373
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Destruction of the LTT or weakening it. If the latter than to what degree,

374
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:07.000
we had not fought through the eventuality of the Sri Lankan government refusing to fulfill its part of the accord obligations.

375
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
We did not know what to do with a warring LTT, hostile population, or recalcitrant Sri Lankan government.

376
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:30.000
And as it finally turned out, we were not even sure of what our national interests were and what military intervention and later military operations were required to achieve.

377
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
This is when you hear all the time about people saying, oh, you got to write down your goals.

378
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
So this is what they're talking about. You got to know what your goals are. You got to have them clear.

379
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
And then you got to have a relentless pursuance of the aim. That's how you get things done.

380
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
It's kind of like when people are like, I got to get them better shape, but that's it.

381
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It needs to be a clear goal. What does that mean?

382
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Is that a certain amount of running? Is that a body weight that you're trying to reach?

383
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Is that a strength goal? What does that goal?

384
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Do you write it down? Do you know exactly what it is and is it clear?

385
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Next, aggressive spirit. It's an interesting how we keep hearing this word aggression and aggressiveness in all these different principles of war.

386
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Aggressiveness is so important.

387
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000
And what we talked about on the last podcast and I talked about how it had to be balanced.

388
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
But it has to be balanced.

389
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
But man, it has to be there. That aggressiveness has got to be there. In low intensity, long, drawn conflict,

390
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
unflagging aggressive spirit is a vital importance far more than in conventional offensive action.

391
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
The LTT had realized it thoroughly and practiced it with great deliberation and to great effect.

392
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
We were somewhat lacking in it.

393
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And I think this insurgency and this talking about an insurgency when we're talking about life and becoming better is because it is a long-term struggle.

394
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Right? You know, the conventional war is a fast war where you know what's going to happen.

395
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
You know what your enemy is you go and you fight them and it's done. It's very easy.

396
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:32.000
The conventional, I mean, the, the, the, the insurgent war is more like what we go through as humans trying to improve because it's a long, drawn out struggle.

397
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:41.000
And we're, we got pieces of our brain that are changing sides just like the local populist might in its very, very challenging.

398
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And that's why this notion of aggressiveness and knowing what your aim is and then this relentless pursuance of this aim and getting aggressive as you pursue that aim.

399
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Can you see how how important those are? Obviously in an, in an encounter in search and situation, but also as you develop your plan to become a better person and a better leader.

400
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Oh yeah absolutely critical.

401
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Especially, I mean, one of the many things similar to the insurgent comparison is the temptations that come up every day.

402
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:21.000
No matter if you're trying to make more money, you know, with your own business or get in shape, get in shape is a good one.

403
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I think so easy to talk about. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a lot of parallels that in my opinion are really clear.

404
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:42.000
So these temptations just like the insurgents they'll pop up or they won't be around for a day, two days and then one day it's your best friends birthday and you know, he's going to, I don't know, dunk and don't know, something for you know,

405
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
there it is. Birthday and there it is. All of a sudden yeah, an insurgent attack.

406
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And they come up every day on a spec that will sometimes are expected, but sometimes not expected.

407
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
It's just so dynamic in that way, where all these things are there to kind of get you and what's good when those things come to get you,

408
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
get any aggressive mindset where you'll get aggressive with that situation, you get aggressive with those donuts.

409
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Yeah, I mean, aggressive we put them in the garbage. Yeah, and that's so true.

410
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000
And one of these things do come up. It's so it's so much. I don't say, yeah, I would say easier to be like, no, I'm I'm on the programmer now.

411
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:25.000
If you're a graduate, if you're a pro, if you're like, you know, I'm going to allow excuses to get in my head or kind of kind of pussy foot around and be like, well, you know,

412
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
moderation is all right kind of thing and have that attitude.

413
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
It's going to get you.

414
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Yeah, you're aggressive. You can take, you know, take us to take in a way, take pride in the fact that it's nope, I'm not even going to go that's nope, I'm not drink, I'm not going out to the club drinking, I got a rest, I got to work out in the morning or whatever.

415
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Yeah, that aggression does help man.

416
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
That aggression does it.

417
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
It's, it's almost like if you don't, if you do kind of just kind of tip till your way through it, it wins.

418
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Yeah, that's what it's like.

419
00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000
It's like, you can't even get it done.

420
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
It's the same thing with this with account of insurgency. You have to be aggressive. You can't let those little things creep in. And you've got to keep that relentless pursuance of the aim and you got to do it aggressively.

421
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Yeah.

422
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Next.

423
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Surprise.

424
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000
This embraces surprise at tactical strategic and political levels.

425
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:42.000
The IPKF that's the Indian Peacekeeping Force could not do anything, could not do anything. In the tactical field, it was unable to match the LTT mainly because of the lack of innovation and serious application of all our professional acumen to stymie our to stymie the LTT, our methods largely remained conventional.

426
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:50.000
So surprise and how important surprises now.

427
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
How do we surprise ourselves?

428
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
I can tell you. You've got to surprise yourself.

429
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
If you can't surprise yourself, it means you lack creativity.

430
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
If you're not coming up with new ideas and new ways to do things, you're lacking creativity and you're lacking surprise.

431
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:14.000
So, you know, I was, I've been traveling a bunch lately. And guess what? Sometimes in a hotel room.

432
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000
And I got to get creative on how to aggressively pursue my aims. And that means I got to do, you know, maybe my work out was 300 burpees.

433
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
That's it. Boom.

434
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000
No squat rack there. No pull-up bar. No rings. No rower. Nothing. No kettlebells. No. And guess what? I'm my soul gets crushed.

435
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000
But that's just being creative and aggressively adapting to the situations that you get put into.

436
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
So you've got to maintain that adaptability, that creativity all the time. And I think that's absolutely critical.

437
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Man, and that's one yet another one of those times where it's so easy to be like,

438
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Dang this hotel doesn't have a gym. Oh yeah.

439
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
You know, or it's dangerous.

440
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Dang this is no like really healthy food or, there's the McDonald's right there.

441
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
There's no healthy food in this town even. Yeah.

442
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
So that, that healthy food thing, especially when you look, start looking at intermittent fasting.

443
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
You know, oh, you're in the airport and they don't have, you know, all you can get is those,

444
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
those little hot dogs wrapped in a pretzel. Those things are so tasty.

445
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
But you know, like you should not be eating those, right?

446
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000
And sometimes you, you're like, oh, okay, I'll eat them. Why?

447
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
You should be on the intermittent fast when you're in the travel situation.

448
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Yeah. You don't need to be eating.

449
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
And I'm telling you this right now and it's fresh my memory because I had two of those bad boys this morning.

450
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
And they were good. Yeah.

451
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
The weakness crept in.

452
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
You know, and I got some of those pretzel loft hot dogs.

453
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Dang. You know what is perfect? The one is perfect.

454
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Next one, mobility and flexibility.

455
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
The insurgent must have developed, must develop intelligent and

456
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
gifle flexibility in planning, conducting and overseeing actions.

457
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
So as to retain initiative, suffer the least damage and yet keep the opponent guessing.

458
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
And in a prolonged state of readiness and uncertainty.

459
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Such that the insurgent has to do. They got to be super flexible.

460
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
They got to keep you guessing and keep you in a prolonged state of readiness.

461
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
That sounds good, right?

462
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Prolong state of readiness. That sounds good, but it's actually not good.

463
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
When you constantly own an edge, that's where people down.

464
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
It breaks them down over time.

465
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
But where we failed was we did not exhibit enough flexibility in our strategic

466
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:48.000
and tactical plans and their gileful execution. We had to seize the initiative and

467
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
pose challenges to the LTT, which we largely failed to do.

468
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
So you know, mobility, flexibility.

469
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Something we talk about all the time on this podcast is having the ability to adapt and be flexible

470
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000
and you know, whether it's working out in a hotel room, whether it's, you know, finding something good to eat

471
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
or not eating because there is nothing good to eat.

472
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Whether it's being in a leadership situation and you're adapting to a personality that you,

473
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
that is awkward or different or you're not ready for, or a situation that needs to be overcome,

474
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
that's flexibility and mobility and you have to maintain that.

475
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Motivation and discipline.

476
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000
In prolonged, slow, bleeding, low intensity, people oriented struggle.

477
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Motivation and discipline as ingredients of morale are far more important.

478
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:52.000
The LTT and the people had both these two remarkable degree.

479
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000
The IPKF's discipline was as good as any armies, even the LTT's.

480
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.000
But its motivation was limited to the spirit of professionalism only.

481
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
We were soldiers we did as ordered.

482
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So the LTT had this passionate goal that they were going after and that encouraged their discipline.

483
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.000
They understood why they were doing what they were doing.

484
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
And that's something that clear goal.

485
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
They understood why are we doing this because we were on our own state.

486
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Now, did the IPKF know why they were doing what they were doing?

487
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
No, they did not. They just, he just talked about that.

488
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000
They knew what their goal was. They knew how it was going to affect.

489
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
They didn't know what their end state was supposed to be.

490
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
So when you take that away from them, even though they're discipline troops, they missed that last level.

491
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And that's why. Why are you doing this?

492
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And that is why it's so important for you as you try and reach your goals.

493
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
As you try and get something done, you keep that in mind of why you're doing this.

494
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
What's the end state going to be? Because it's so easy to lose track of the end state.

495
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
I mean, if you're trying to make, you know, you're trying to get gain 25 pounds of muscle.

496
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I mean, that's going to take you a couple years, possibly.

497
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000
If you're trying to make a million dollars, that may take you 10 years.

498
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Might take you six years. That's a long ways.

499
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
And there's a lot of distractions.

500
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
I'm going to come all the way.

501
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Yeah. Into your point.

502
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Consider why. Why do you want to gain 25 pounds of, we'll say losing weight.

503
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Right. So let's say you have a photo shoot.

504
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Or are you going on spring break or something like that?

505
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Let me just think of all the big photo shoots.

506
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
I'm not going to wait. That's never happened.

507
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Let's talk about this. Let's talk about you trying to lose weight.

508
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Because you're trying to be healthy.

509
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Right. That's a long term goal that's realistic.

510
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Yes. Yeah. And whatever that means, right, healthy.

511
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Or what if your healthy person already, but you just want to.

512
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I don't know. Look better.

513
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Or achieve something.

514
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
How long you've got a jiu-jitsu turner coming up.

515
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Yeah. Right.

516
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Cut some weight. Right. Exactly.

517
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
So it makes it so much easier to cut.

518
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
I mean, when you have a specific. Yes.

519
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
So you've got to fight coming up.

520
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
That guy's going to cut that weight.

521
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Wait. Quick. You hear these guys cutting all this weight.

522
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Like, oh, yeah. He has a fight in a month and a half.

523
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
And he got to cut 40 pounds.

524
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
And then he'll do it.

525
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Because yeah. I mean, obviously, they're trained athletes as well.

526
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
But that goal in understanding it.

527
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Man, help so much.

528
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Especially when I'm going to read this part again.

529
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
And again, we talk about when you're trying to get stuff done as a person.

530
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
It's a prolonged slow bleeding low intensity.

531
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
People oriented struggle.

532
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
That's what it is. That's what you're up against.

533
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Yeah.

534
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
You know, that's what you're up against.

535
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
It's a low anything that's worth achieving as a person.

536
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
It takes all those. It's long. It's slow.

537
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
It's probably, you know, there's nothing.

538
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
You go, oh, this is going to be the ultimate achievement of my life.

539
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
And it's going to take you 15 minutes to do.

540
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Now, it's going to take you months and months and months and years of effort of blood

541
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
sweat and tears to get there.

542
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Now, continuing with discipline and morale.

543
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
This goes into a section of the book where you start talking about their performance.

544
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
And we're going to take a little bit of a turn here.

545
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
But I think it's important to bring up.

546
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
In the initial stages of the war in October to December of 1987,

547
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
there were complaints and reports of rape,

548
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
looting, and want and destruction indulged in by the IPKF.

549
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
When a soldier is pushed and led into a blind alley,

550
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
like the situation in Jafna, where it suddenly changed from so well,

551
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Tom Tomed piecekeeping operations into a full fledged battlefield.

552
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000
He feels terribly insecure and starts seeing an enemy all over.

553
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
So we talked about this earlier.

554
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
These guys, they're going on a nice piecekeeping mission,

555
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
and they put their blue helmets on and, you know,

556
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
be a referee.

557
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Well, the referee gets attacked.

558
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000
And this is starting to talk about the psychological effect it has,

559
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
and they start seeing an enemy everywhere.

560
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
You know, and this reminds me of when I was in high school,

561
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
and I was lucky enough to have a bunch of a Vietnam that were put me through high school.

562
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
And when I was in high school, the movie, Pultune came out.

563
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
And of course, I was, you know, all in the war and whatnot.

564
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
So I went and saw the movie Pultune,

565
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000
and one of my teachers that wasn't Vietnam had seen the movie as well.

566
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
And I asked them straight up, you know, hey, what'd you think of the movie?

567
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000
And he explained to me in a very solemn way that the movie depicted these Americans going in,

568
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
and, you know, brutalizing these villages and, you know, doing horrible things to these villagers.

569
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But the way he explained it to me, he said, listen, you know, we'd be in, in and around a village for three or four weeks.

570
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000
And in that three or four weeks, they, the Americans would lose seven or eight guys to booby traps.

571
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And meanwhile, the villagers don't hit any booby traps.

572
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So they're out walking the same trails and the same areas through the right, same rice patties.

573
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And the villagers aren't hitting any booby traps.

574
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
They're not getting blown up. They're not getting killed.

575
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So that means they kind of know where they are.

576
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And he said that kind of frustration is exactly what this is talking about right here.

577
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
In and, and I'm going back to it.

578
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
In an insurgency spark and sustained by an opponent who is dressed in civilian clothes,

579
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000
but shoots and blows him up unseen, suspicion alone takes a vicious turn.

580
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
When he sees his comrades being killed by innocent looking civilians,

581
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000
blending again into the civilian population, he gets into a rage and anger against the uncertainty and the unseen.

582
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
At that point, his pent-up tension, welling feeling of helplessness,

583
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and burning desire to explode into a release of counter violence,

584
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
are in front of a tangible object he can master,

585
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
an object which is weak and helpless itself.

586
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
What better object than a frightened weak, countering woman,

587
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
an unguarded, wide open shop,

588
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
an unresisting defenseless house and its feeble occupants,

589
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.000
who sheltered the unseen deceitful opponent, had obtained by whatever means.

590
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It is madness, the animal in him, that rules momentarily.

591
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
He is wild, but just for a brief spell,

592
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
if he can get a hold of himself or if someone controls him in that moment of crisis,

593
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000
of cathartic explosion, he might not all probability get over his base or instincts.

594
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Where this does not happen, then the explosion manifests in counter assault,

595
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
rape, loot, and want in destruction, seeking release from tension, fear, and rage.

596
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Education, motivation, communication, and company, are good anecdotes, and anecdotes, sorry.

597
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Most culprits realize within minutes of their act and repent,

598
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
we being like children.

599
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I saw an officer with 27 years of service breaking down like this.

600
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So that's what happens to people.

601
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I think there's so much in that paragraph, this paragraph about this pent-up tension,

602
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and we've got to remember that it's extreme in a situation like this,

603
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
that the tension is extreme, the fear is extreme, the rage is extreme.

604
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But, and obviously for those that are listening that are in combat right now,

605
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
that are deployed overseas, these are things that you have to watch out for.

606
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And especially as a leader, you've got to be the person that controls him in the moment of crisis

607
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
of cathartic explosion.

608
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
As a leader, that's got to be what your job is.

609
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And also, as you work in businesses, as a leader, you've got to sense now that things won't be as dramatic as this,

610
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
but you can get people that do make mistakes in business.

611
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
They make ethical mistakes, they make more or more mistakes, they feel that pressure,

612
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
and they want to lash out and they make mistakes.

613
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And you've got to get them through those moments, you've got to pay attention to it.

614
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It is under these circumstances back to the book.

615
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It is under these circumstances of total uncertainty,

616
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
initial disorientation, sudden violence, inability to communicate because there was language differences,

617
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and lack of effective control and education that excesses were committed by a few, by a few.

618
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
But the command and leadership chain rapidly gathered their brood once again,

619
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
within the warmth of their moral influence and disciplinary binding.

620
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And quarries were instituted and disciplinary action taken against the defaulters.

621
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Warped minds had to be weeded out, but there were not very many.

622
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
After February, to March of 1988, the incident rates dropped to almost zero.

623
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So they were able to get control of the situation, to weed it out, get rid of the sadists,

624
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and the folks that couldn't control themselves.

625
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But this is the type of pressure that you see military people under,

626
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and especially in these counterinserts and see operations like we've had for the last ten or 15 years in Iraq and Afghanistan,

627
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000
where you have a local populist, you have IEDs, you have indirect fire mortars,

628
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and guys are getting killed, and where do you place the rage, where does it come out?

629
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And that is a huge challenge for leadership to try and keep that in check to the best of your ability.

630
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And speaking of leadership from the book, what we lacked in many and instance was what I should specifically emphasize,

631
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
inspiring leadership.

632
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
If the leader, particularly the formation commander, did not inspire his command,

633
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
then that body of troops would be at half its effectiveness.

634
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
So, late for an I talk about an extreme ownership.

635
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, and here is another example of saying,

636
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you know, he's saying that if the leader is not inspiring, they're going to be a half their effectiveness.

637
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:44.000
For instance, if he visited a post and the men did not talk warmly and quizzantly and fondly about the visit for the next week or ten days,

638
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
and if they did not perceive a challenge left behind by the commander,

639
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
not feel a spontaneous desire to meet it, in thinking it hard to solve, and thinking hard to solve it,

640
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and bracing to present an innovative novelty to the commander on his next visit,

641
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
then it is better that this type of commander did not visit it all.

642
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So, these saying, you know, if you're not inspiring, if you're not inspiring your people,

643
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it's better not even to show up.

644
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Many formation commanders failed to inspire.

645
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Not many of them ruffed it out with the troops on patrols, ambushes,

646
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
staying in their post at night, on road opening and raid or hell-lending missions.

647
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And this is an example of kind of a negative example, and this is very clear.

648
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And you actually see this portrayed in movies about Vietnam a lot, and you'll get that very quickly.

649
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The brigade commander would land by a helicopter and a post on a hell-a-pad, which had to be secured.

650
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So, I mean, soldiers had to go out and like secure this hell-a-pad somewhere and set security around it,

651
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
and move the brush and make sure there's no mines on it, etc. etc.

652
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Then the general would breeze past a few bodies lying in the muck and mud,

653
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
beam a flashy smile to affect unconcern for danger, have a hurried chat with a local leader,

654
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
blurred out directions or orders, sip a cup of tea or coconut juice,

655
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
showing no concern for the soldiers who labored under those circumstances to prepare it,

656
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and offer before you could blink an eye, would be often this chopper.

657
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
What inspiration could his men in the post draw from that?

658
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It's a stereotypical thing, and it really happens. It really does happen.

659
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And you see that with not just military leaders, but you see that with senior leaders in big companies,

660
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
where the folks on the front lines, on the construction side, or on the main,

661
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
in the manufacturing plant, the boss is coming.

662
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So, what do they have to do? They have to do all this preparation. They've got to clean everything,

663
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
they've got to go to think dialed in, and then the guy shows up for five minutes, and it took,

664
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
you know, four hours to get everything ready, the guy shows up for five minutes,

665
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
who asks the quarks mile, and then leaves.

666
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Is anyone inspired by that? No, absolutely not.

667
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We had three types of officers.

668
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:22.000
One category was that which thought acted moved about, was bold, and got down to business fastest,

669
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
even in totally alien confusing unknown environment.

670
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Getting down to business. That's the guy.

671
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The second one consisted of those who had the brains, and moved about as best they could,

672
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
but lacked boldness and ability to inspire.

673
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
The third category consisted of those who simply slogged when prodded,

674
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and complained about their troops not being trained,

675
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
orders not being clearly given, and so on.

676
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
They could do nothing else. They're units suffered.

677
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So that's the guy that doesn't take ownership of anything.

678
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
This year that complained about their troops not being trained,

679
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
orders not being clearly given, and so on.

680
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
That guy is not a good leader.

681
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
There's always doing this complaining that his orders weren't clear.

682
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
He's complaining up and down the chain of commands.

683
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The guys blow me aren't trained right. The guys above me aren't giving clear orders.

684
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
This guy's a disaster. Don't be that guy. Don't be that leader.

685
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And here's a piece on leading from the front.

686
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
There was a big battle, and there was a bunch of friendly casualties.

687
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And now I'm going to the books.

688
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
There are belongings, dress, and equipment.

689
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Lay tattered and strewn all over a huge playground.

690
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And I went up there on one of my visits.

691
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I thought this was disrespectful to the brave souls,

692
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000
and asked the escort team accompanying me to help pick up all those items

693
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
and remove them from public gaze.

694
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
To my acute horror, not one of them moved to pick them up.

695
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
The escort team consisted of all denominations, but none dared.

696
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So here we are. He's out on this battlefield.

697
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
There's all gear and personal effects of all these guys that were killed.

698
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And it's just been sitting there and no one's moved it.

699
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And so he tells the team that he's with, like,

700
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
okay, so it goes to start round and up the gear, and anyone will do it.

701
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And if you're looking at them, you became painful to see such reluctance.

702
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I spontaneously got down from my open Jeep, walked up to a pair of pouches,

703
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
and a belt, and picked them up, brought them to my Jeep.

704
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then the Brigadier General that was with him did it as well,

705
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
was the next to do so.

706
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It was only after this at the rest of the escort team got down

707
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
and gathered the other items,

708
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
a little bit of leadership from the front right there.

709
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And I think we're going to close with a section right here.

710
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Views and visits have seen your generals, and their interaction with field commanders and troops did little to inspire us subordinates.

711
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Provided little worthwhile guidance and clarified little

712
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
as to what the whole game plan was about.

713
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So these guys had no idea of what the why was.

714
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Everybody lived and fought from one day to the next.

715
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
No strategic view.

716
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Our wait for pearls of wisdom remained endless.

717
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
What increasingly showed up instead was the political eye and bluster of the generals,

718
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
the tentativeness and uncertainty of the army commander above them,

719
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and the army chief, which did little to change systemic in communities

720
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and tackle the hidden rock.

721
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Consequently, boldness and experimentation became prominent casualties.

722
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:28.000
So this glaring eye from the senior leadership snuffed out the creativity and the boldness of the troops.

723
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000
They actually made this intense, scrutiny.

724
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Like I said, it made the troops not want to do anything.

725
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And I think not only should you keep that in consideration as a leader that you make sure that you're not snuffing out creativity from your troops,

726
01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:07.000
but also on a personal level, you can't let the fear of failure limit your boldness and your experimentation.

727
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And that's something that happens all the time. People are afraid to step out and try something new.

728
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Yeah, and I mentioned this before, where a lot of the time the reason for that is when people get punished for making honest mistakes.

729
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You definitely should not punish people for making honest mistakes.

730
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And when you are going to take risks yourself, you need to cut yourself some slack and realize that things might not go perfect.

731
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And I'll tell you, I mean, another example that's sitting right in front of us right now is this podcast that we're doing.

732
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Because people are asking, you know, hey, you should do a podcast, but there's, you know, okay, well, where's it going to go?

733
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Do we really want to do it? What's the, what do people actually going to think of it?

734
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You know, it's one thing to have do a podcast with a guy like Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan or Sam Harris where you've got this, you know,

735
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
famous individual and of course people want to listen to them, but who's going to want to listen to Jocco and Echo?

736
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
So there's some, you know, let's, but, but, okay, what's the worst thing that's happened?

737
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
We fail, no one listens to it, okay, cool, it wasn't going to affect me that bad.

738
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
You know, we'd move on and figure something else to do.

739
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But that's the kind of thing that that experimentation that can lead to good stuff.

740
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And if you don't allow yourself to do that, then you're going to have problems. And the same way, if you don't allow your troopers to make mistakes like you said and try new things and you don't encourage that, then they're going to be,

741
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
their morale is going to be crushed and they're not going to make the progress that they need to do need to make.

742
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yeah, I mean, you can kind of look at that type of scenario.

743
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Or from like an expanded point of view, like the big picture where if someone's not raised, I kind of mentioned this before as well, where if someone is raised in a really rigid household where, you know, the,

744
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
the kid who's taking piano lessons, he makes one wrong key and he gets whacked with a ruler, right?

745
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And let's say someone was just raised like that in like every little mistake.

746
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
They're going to be so reluctant to start something new.

747
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
They're going to be so scared and a lot of times you don't even feel like you know why you're scared.

748
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
It's just just scary.

749
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:39.000
A lot of anxiety comes when you think about or consider branching out doing something new, fear of failure and all this is so embedded in you because of that punishment that you received.

750
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000
So you're trained, you know, you're trained to avoid mistakes or new stuff that you might make.

751
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And that's something we've dealt with in the military for the last several years, last probably a couple decades was this, we, we called the zero defect mentality.

752
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And where's like, okay, if this, if this guy made any mistakes over his career, he was not going to be advanced, he was not going to be promoted.

753
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And they've really tried to move away from that because like you said that completely suffocates any type of risk taken any type of creativity, any willingness to go outside the box and try something new, it just suffocates it.

754
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Yeah, so I was definitely never a person that would hammer people from making mistakes as long as they were, we'll call them good mistakes, right?

755
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Just not just making stupid mistakes.

756
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Yeah, we're being careless and I don't want you to know being careless is bad.

757
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Yeah, so that kind of wraps up the book assignment, Jaffna, I, I started to pan, Ponday, great book and I don't know if you can get a hold of it.

758
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
But those are some major lessons that I learned from it.

759
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And again, I bought this book while I was in Sri Lanka and read it and it definitely influenced me.

760
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And as I started fighting a counter-insurgency war myself, I would think about what they went through and how difficult it was for them.

761
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And I knew we would be facing some very difficult times as well.

762
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Yeah, that's interesting how that is essentially,

763
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I'm going to big way the opposite of your book, where he's, this is basically a cautionary tale from beginning to end, just how not to do it.

764
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah, and although, and you know from from our book, our book has a lot of, this was a mistake that we made, here's what we did wrong.

765
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Now, strategically overall, it was a very successful, you know, what the army did and what the one one AD did and what the two two eight, what all these soldiers and Marines did over a longer period of time with us seals as well, was successful overall.

766
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:50.000
But we definitely point out the errors of our way because there's successful operations outlined in this book as well, but you don't learn as much from.

767
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Yeah, I picked out a couple of the other ones that went wrong because of course you learn more from your mistakes.

768
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah. And you know, in the book that late for my wrote, it's definitely a lot of those stories about the mistakes we made because we learned more from them as brutal as that is that's the reality.

769
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yeah, that's all.

770
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Before we get in the questions, I do want to say if I did this pronounce incorrectly pronounced anything from assignment, Jeff, no, I sincerely apologize.

771
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So, my boss, I'm sorry.

772
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So with that, we'll go into some questions from the interwebs.

773
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:51.000
This question from geekin dad, juggle willing. How do you deal with fatigue both mental and physical?

774
01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:11.000
How do I deal with fatigue, mental and physical? I rest. And you know, when, when if I'm feeling like just completely overtrained and weak, I usually tell, well, I tell my fighters, I'd say, hey, you just got your butt kick today.

775
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Go eat a big steak tonight, take tomorrow off. You just need rest. And it's pretty obvious when that happens. And so I do the same thing for myself. If I'm feeling horrible and you know, you can see occasionally my workouts is consistent like, you know, doing some mobility training rolling it out.

776
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:37.000
You know, doing a big stretch. That's because I'm just tired and I know it. And so I just give myself some downtime.

777
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I think it's very important to know the difference between being lazy and being overtrained. And it's very easy to make that excuse for yourself.

778
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And that's why I always air on the side of I'm working out. I'm training because and usually then the next day.

779
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So if I feel like exhausted today, I won't take today off, but I will take the next step. But I work out today just to make sure that it's not just being lazy.

780
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So I'll do another workout, get another training session in or whatever the case may be. So I make sure that's not just that moment.

781
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Because sometimes the next day you're like, you know, I'm not that bad. Right. I'm going to get him back in the game.

782
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Back on the program. The the other thing people ask me all the time. I've probably written this a dozen times or more on Twitter is do I take naps and the answer is yes.

783
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
In fact, I slept on the I flew today and I slept probably two hours on the plane.

784
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And that's a little bit more than an app and I'm not going to play in every day. So what do I do for naps? Yes, I do take naps.

785
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:51.000
What I do for naps is something that I learned from a high school teacher that I had was I walked into his office one day and he had his feet up on the desk above his heart.

786
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And I said, what are you doing? And he said, oh, this is really good for you. Put your feet above your heart.

787
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And it allows the blood to circulate out of your feet and gives, you know, let's your your veins and your one way valves and your veins rest a little bit.

788
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And it gets a little pools of blood out of random places and it's good and it's good. And so I tried it and it felt really good.

789
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And so when I was going through sea of training, I used to when I come in we have a couple minutes between evolutions and I just go in and put my feet up.

790
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I want to go out sleep for a few minutes, you know, nowadays if I can, I'll try and sleep for like six to eight minutes. Set my timer on my iPhone and you look like distressed when I said six to eight minutes.

791
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Yeah, you don't consider anything under the three hours to be.

792
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah, that's not legitimate now.

793
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000
But if I sleep for like an hour, then I'm up for too long at night. I won't be able to go to sleep too much rest.

794
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Gotcha.

795
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Yeah.

796
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Under what circumstances are you going to take a nap though? Like how do you just tell?

797
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I'm just tired off feeling myself like now. Oh, yes, like sleepy tired.

798
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
And that's the thing is I can do if I'm a, if my mind is engaged in something or especially my body is engaged in something.

799
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's what's cool about working out. You can work out when you're exhausted because once you start moving to something you're going to fall sleep while you're doing squats.

800
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Right. Like you fall sleep while you're doing pull ups.

801
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Yeah. You're just going to do the pull ups. You're just going to do this squats. And when you get down you'll be tired. You're going to sleep.

802
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Right. What's hard to do? And this is when like when we were writing the book when I was writing my section of the books.

803
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I'd be writing a night, 11 o'clock at night, 12 o'clock at night, be trying to hammer through it.

804
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And sometimes it just falls, you know, be falling asleep.

805
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Oh, man.

806
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So, but that feeling of ham just falling asleep.

807
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
That's not good.

808
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yeah.

809
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000
So when I'm feeling that tired, all pounded. I put it's like one of those things where I also like to push through it.

810
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000
So, sometimes just trying power through it because honestly even even a short nap for me will kind of make me stay up too late at night.

811
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And all of a sudden, we want to clock them all in a minute.

812
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Yeah.

813
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
You've been at six to eight minutes.

814
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Six to eight minutes.

815
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Six to eight minutes. A pound up. A six to eight minute pound up can make you feel amazing.

816
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Oh, yeah.

817
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It can make you feel amazing.

818
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Don't underestimate the power to up.

819
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
It is a legit fool right there.

820
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yeah.

821
01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yeah.

822
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I actually used to take like 15 minutes.

823
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yeah.

824
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yeah.

825
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
15 minutes.

826
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah.

827
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I know that's over here for you.

828
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That's a little much going into laziness.

829
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
No, seriously.

830
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
15 minutes is, yeah, you probably felt like, yeah.

831
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Outstanding.

832
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But it only helps with that sleepy type because let's say I'm used to a certain amount of sleep.

833
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Let's say get two and a half hours less sleep than I'm used to.

834
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It goes way beyond me feeling just sleepy tired.

835
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It's like physically tired.

836
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Oh, really?

837
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Yeah.

838
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So,

839
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Yeah.

840
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I don't have that issue.

841
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah.

842
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah.

843
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That's your different.

844
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
So, if I take a ten minute power nap one night.

845
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And I'm lacking two and a half hours of my ponenquilting.

846
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Oh, we'll make up for it right?

847
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
No.

848
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:40.000
No.

849
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
No.

850
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:41.000
No.

851
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
No.

852
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It helps me when I get my normal sleep you ever take.

853
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But I've been doing a lot of stuff during the day.

854
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You know?

855
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And you're like, dang, I did a lot.

856
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
My brain was kind of used a lot.

857
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And dang I have this.

858
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Whatever I got to do now.

859
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Yeah.

860
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Then you take the 10, 15 minute nap ten.

861
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
It brings you right back.

862
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah.

863
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And it typically will not mess with me.

864
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I wonder how much of this is just you just not just.

865
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Just powering through stuff.

866
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Yeah.

867
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Probably all of it.

868
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But nonetheless, that's how it is for me.

869
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
For sure.

870
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000
It'd be interesting to at some point for you to experiment with like lack of sleep and sleep

871
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That you're patient and see how well you can perform.

872
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Like I've been noticing that where I don't get a lot of sleep.

873
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I can still perform really well.

874
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Yeah.

875
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
At some physical activities.

876
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And then after a few days though, I do, I do feel like garbage.

877
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Right.

878
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And then we some physical activities that I'll feel just a week at.

879
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
But yeah.

880
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And you're right.

881
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Well, there are the, I mean as long as it's like one time or even two times or

882
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
it.

883
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So if I film or something and let's say I film in the morning, but then I've been working

884
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
late the night before.

885
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
When I go into film, I'm like charged up.

886
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I'm sure there's all kinds of factors in there.

887
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
A lot of it's like adrenaline.

888
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Not like it's like this huge adrenaline rush.

889
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
But there's that little bit of adrenaline because of the task.

890
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
You know, so that helps.

891
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And a lot of times just like how you said, if I made the decision like, no, I'm not going to miss this workout at all under any circumstances.

892
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Then I happen to get two and a half hours less sleep than I.

893
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And I go in and I how you say power through it.

894
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You can totally do it.

895
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yeah.

896
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
But I'm seeking comfort fully for sure.

897
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
But it still does help though.

898
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But dance the question.

899
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yes.

900
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
If you're tired, sleep.

901
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Mm-hmm.

902
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
If you need rest rest.

903
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Right.

904
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And don't try and over train yourself.

905
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
You probably are over training and just need some rest.

906
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Yeah.

907
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Next.

908
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Um.

909
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
We don't have an author on this one.

910
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But um, what are your thoughts on freakishly strong guys in BJJ?

911
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Who go too hard.

912
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Get hurt and pain it as if it's your fault.

913
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Cause it's got rolled with the maniac tonight.

914
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
The guy that rolled with the maniac.

915
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
So we've all been there.

916
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
We're rolling with the maniac.

917
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Okay.

918
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So this is a.

919
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
This seems like a pretty straightforward question at first.

920
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But then all of a sudden it gets really complicated.

921
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
It really does.

922
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Who is it fault here?

923
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Right.

924
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So you're wrong with the guy.

925
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Guys, super strong.

926
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
You catch him in the submission.

927
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And guess what?

928
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He doesn't want to tap.

929
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And so the next thing you know, there's a little pop.

930
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
There's a little crack.

931
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And you've got an injury and the big guy that was going all crazy.

932
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
So I can't believe you did this.

933
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So a question is who's it fault?

934
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And there's actually two science to that story.

935
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And a lot of ways because.

936
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
In from one.

937
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
In one way the higher belt, right, or a more experienced guy.

938
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Should never really hurt a lower belt, right?

939
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I mean, if if I'm a black belt and I'm going to get super about.

940
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I really shouldn't hurt that person because if I do.

941
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I probably meant to do it.

942
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I mean, of course, there's, you know, mistakes happen.

943
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And I'm not talking, I'm talking about submission, right?

944
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I'm not talking about, hey, I, I, I went over and it made you roll your ankle or you caught your wrist as you were falling out or something like that.

945
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Those are just incidents, incidental, you know, things that happen in GJ2.

946
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
But, you know, so the, so the higher belt generally shouldn't be like putting someone in a submission and hurting them because

947
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000
experience guys and GJ2, they know when the tension is there on the arm or the foot or the knee.

948
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:36.000
They know that that tension means the next amount of pressure is going to take this beyond the limit of the joint and they're going to have an injury.

949
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So either big guy, he's going psycho and he's got a big ego.

950
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
And that's why he's not tapping.

951
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
So so that must be his fault, right?

952
01:28:47.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Well, at the same time, if someone doesn't tap and then you hurt them, well, that's kind of jacked up too because you shouldn't be getting someone's foot and cranking it or getting their arm and cranking it when you know,

953
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I mean, maybe they couldn't tap, maybe they were almost stuck or whatever, now we'll suddenly hurt them.

954
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
So I really do think it's both, I think both people aren't fault.

955
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah.

956
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And I think that part of the dual safety mechanisms is GJ2 is that there's two people that control the situation.

957
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
But one that's getting submitted should tap and the one that's doing this submission should, you know,

958
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
should know to stop before the injury occurs.

959
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Again, there's about a million little things that can happen where you're going to introduce your GJ2.

960
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Our mox that get thrown on and it's a little tweak and and that stuff does happen.

961
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But when I look at Dean and I Dean Lester who's in my main training partner have been training with for 20 years,

962
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
we've put thousands, literally thousands and thousands of submissions on each other.

963
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And neither one of us has ever hurt the other one.

964
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And neither one of us has ever gotten hurt from a submission.

965
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.000
But I'm talking thousands of submission. Of course most of those, you know, many of those, most of those are him submitting me.

966
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But I mean, I've submitted him many, many times as well.

967
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And never have one of us got a submission on the other one.

968
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And hurt, you know, the person and I can tell you, he's let go of hundreds of submissions on me.

969
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:36.000
And I've let go on many submissions on him because I go, you know what, oh, I've got this.

970
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000
He's, you know, he's not tapping for wherever reason would go to the next move.

971
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Or he gets me in some weird position. He, you know, he's got it, but he's let's go and go to the next move.

972
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And what's really cool about this is what you end up with is you end up with an ego free training.

973
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Because the truth of the matter is, I don't care if Dean taps me.

974
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And I don't care if I tap Dean. Like, and he doesn't care if he taps me and he doesn't care if he gets the tap from me.

975
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So what we are able to do then is take all kinds of risks and do all kinds of crazy flow drills and and where we're really trying to get each other.

976
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But at the same time, we really don't care.

977
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And, and the biggest dichotomy of that is, I'm sitting here saying, I don't want to get tapped.

978
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You know, I don't care if I get tapped by Dean, but it drives me crazy when I get tapped by Dean.

979
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000
He tries me crazy. You can hear you're like, someone's a gym on me like, I get frustrated because I got tapped.

980
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
But it's frustrated at myself and it's frustration in the game and whatever, but it's not.

981
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It's not my ego being like, I didn't want to tap.

982
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It's just a frustration that I made a mistake or whatever.

983
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So that allows you to really learn more.

984
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Now, all this being said, if someone's just a big maniac that goes crazy the whole time and they're going to hurt you,

985
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
well, then you got to make a decision that you're not going to roll with them.

986
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I mean, clearly, you want to not get hurt.

987
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
You want to continue training.

988
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
So someone that's that goes crazy and is super strong.

989
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
You don't want to roll with them.

990
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That being said, and this whole thing has been a non-answerism.

991
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
That being said, because when you do that, you've got to understand that you're avoiding a real issue.

992
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
You're avoiding a big strong guy and how you're going to deal with that guy.

993
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And you will get better dealing with the big strong guy.

994
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
That's what makes you, that's one of the key things to get you better at you, too.

995
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So, you know, you want to train with a big strong guy.

996
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
But that being said, once again, is if you train with a big guy and you get hurt, then you can't train anymore.

997
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So you've got to be smart.

998
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
You've got to use your judgment.

999
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You've got to check your ego.

1000
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You've got to roll with people that have their ego's checked.

1001
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
And I think that's the best way to answer.

1002
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
That's a long answer. It's probably not the most complete answer.

1003
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But there is no clear cut answer because there's a lot of little nuances to every little role in the GJ2.

1004
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Yeah, it seems like there's so many exceptions to all these situations even when you say a higher belt.

1005
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Should never hurt a lower belt.

1006
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
A lot of times, I can just depend.

1007
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Like, what if you're not that much higher and he's bigger than you, more athletic.

1008
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And when you go for a submission, really control, or whatever he's spashing the whole time.

1009
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
So even in your transitions, he's spashing, he's spashing.

1010
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:36.000
So really, the only way you can get that submission is if you go fast and hard to get it.

1011
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It's like getting slapped right on, right?

1012
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And let's say you do it in the midst of your arm bar, you had in the midst of you slapping it on.

1013
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
You kind of extended too much for me, hurt him.

1014
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Yeah.

1015
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
It's really just the nature of the role. And a lot of times, it's nobody's fault. That's just how two guys go in crazy.

1016
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Who care about the submissions they're getting.

1017
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It happens.

1018
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But yeah, you shouldn't care about so much about the submission you're getting. That's the bottom line.

1019
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Well, unless and Greg brought this up where he said, you should care about the submissions you get.

1020
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And you should care about being able to resist the missions as well because it's kind of your response.

1021
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And this was, this would understand the context we're talking. We're talking about like me and him and the guys that that I was talking about was I was rolling with.

1022
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
He said, it's your job to give them an accurate look.

1023
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
If you're a big guy who's, you know, you come in and you're, you know, however big and athletic.

1024
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
You have to give them that look and you have a certain skill level and you just say you got to give them that look.

1025
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
So you provide an accurate experience of rolling with a guy who's, you know,

1026
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
250 pounds brown belt. You have to give it that.

1027
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Yeah, no, that's true. So we say you can't go easy.

1028
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000
You can't go easy. You can't, he's not saying you can't. He's saying that, but if you put on a submission and that guy's not tapping, he's just giving you an accurate look.

1029
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
That your submission isn't submitting him. You're not submitting him. You're not tapping him out.

1030
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And if he's tough and likes a pain or is not scared of the pain, well, that's the look he's giving you.

1031
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:11.000
So you have to complete the move. If you're not going to break his arm, if you have that, that mindset.

1032
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
That's good too, but then you have to work on other situations that you would do in that situation.

1033
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
So if you want to just control the fight more or something like that, then that's what you got to do.

1034
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
But it is, it's up to give you that look.

1035
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
That is something that Dean and I will do that I think is awesome is let's say Dean puts a heel hook on me.

1036
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And instead of cranking it and making me tap, he'll hold it.

1037
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Yeah, and when he holds it, it gives me an opportunity to work some kind of escape.

1038
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Now, sometimes he'll hold it and while he's holding it, he's adjusting his legs and he's actually getting me deeper and deeper into where I can't get out anymore.

1039
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And eventually, I realize I can't move and tap, not because of the pressure, not because of the pain because I realize it's checkmate in the game over.

1040
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:06.000
The same token is, as he's holding it, if I can figure out, I have time to think and consider and go, oh, what if I put my foot here, what if I grab this arm here,

1041
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.000
what if I spin this way or that way, and all of a sudden a real escape opens up, but I had time to think about it.

1042
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Well, maybe next time I do it, I don't have to think and now we actually have figured out and escape from the position.

1043
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Yeah.

1044
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And, and or either I figured out an escape or maybe he figured out the way to finish it with 100% reliability.

1045
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:34.000
So we actually have advanced, that's probably the original advancement in the leglock game for Dean and me was,

1046
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:44.000
and really, for Dean, more than me was him holding a submission and not allowing me to try different things to escape and shutting them down.

1047
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And then eventually, we're like, okay, now I've got your position where there is no escape.

1048
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And that's how things like we end up with like the four or eleven and no to me game overall, that stuff came from holding those positions,

1049
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
because if he just locked him on and cranked it, well then I tap and then we start again, but he didn't have to adjust anything.

1050
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And now you start building technique on top of technique on top of technique.

1051
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Next question.

1052
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And I'm quoting this here.

1053
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Please, can I have some advice with dealing or please, can I have some advice for dealing with poor leaders at work?

1054
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
They have little respect for and the question.

1055
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:33.000
As a subordinate, how do you handle a leader who leads from a place of ego and isn't transparent with information?

1056
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Yeah, so these were a couple of questions actually that I got.

1057
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And I just kind of bunched them together because my answer is going to be very similar for each of them.

1058
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And it's actually very similar to a situation that I'm dealing with right now with a kind of helping out.

1059
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And I wrote something to him recently.

1060
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And what happened was he's in a situation where a leader had come in that didn't have the knowledge inside the industry they were working in.

1061
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So he came from another industry, got put into a leadership position.

1062
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And that guy that new leader was resisting change and not giving support to the new procedures that the guy I was coaching was trying to implement.

1063
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So he was kind of, you know, at a loss for what to do.

1064
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
You know, you got this new manager that's coming in that's inexperienced.

1065
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:35.000
And the guy I'm coaching obviously doesn't respect him because he doesn't have a lot of knowledge in this industry.

1066
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
And so here's the advice I gave.

1067
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I said, you need to set this up to make the new manager look good.

1068
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Make some adjustments to the words you are choosing the tact you are taking.

1069
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And the focus you are using to ensure that your changes make him look good, not bad.

1070
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Now this is so counterintuitive for people.

1071
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000
It's so counterintuitive because they get that person that's above them, the chain of command that doesn't know as much as them that's not as smart as them.

1072
01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
And what do they want to do? They want to bring them down.

1073
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
They want to prove to everybody that they're better.

1074
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I'm better than that guy.

1075
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I deserve that guy's job. That's what everybody's instinct is to do.

1076
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And it's wrong. It's wrong.

1077
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Somehow let the ideas come from him or make him the approver or the driver of some of the S aspects that he can handle.

1078
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000
So I'm actually saying go out of your way to make this easier for this guy.

1079
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Make him look good. Give him credit.

1080
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.000
It's your ego that wants to pull him down. Put your ego in check.

1081
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Help him without being condescending or acting like you know more than him.

1082
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
He shouldn't even know you are helping him.

1083
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.000
If you've been, this is so fun to do is when echo doesn't know this section of the equipment.

1084
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
So I don't say, hey, since you don't know this, I'll teach it to you.

1085
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Right? This condescending tone of you know, but instead of like, hey,

1086
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
have you ever seen the way this one works? I know you've ever seen this specific equipment before.

1087
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Because the way it works, it's a little bit different than some of the other ones.

1088
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You got to do this and this and you can sit back and you can accept that knowledge without feeling like you don't know it.

1089
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
So I'm teaching you, but I'm doing it in a clandestine manner.

1090
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And that's what we're trying to do because we're trying to build.

1091
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
We're trying to do what's trying to build a relationship here.

1092
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to build a relationship.

1093
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And if I go, since you don't know how to use this, I'll show you now.

1094
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
What does that do? Put you on the defensive makes you consider to me to be a threat.

1095
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Now I'm threatening. And that's not good.

1096
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
He should even know you are helping him.

1097
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Respect what he does and show him that you respect it.

1098
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So, you know, I know this is, you probably haven't been down the weeds on this type of gear in a while,

1099
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
but hey, this is the way you don't understand.

1100
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Like, you actually respect the fact that you're up top in charge.

1101
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And I'm just a frontline guy, but here's how you do this if you ever add to it.

1102
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Right. You know what I mean?

1103
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Just downplay what he doesn't know and subtly help him to learn it.

1104
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Right? You know, you probably wouldn't ever have to do this.

1105
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
This new equipment over here.

1106
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I mean, I know it's a little bit below your level.

1107
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Here's how it works if you ever needed it.

1108
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
You don't admit, not like you don't know how to do this.

1109
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:37.000
How do you do? You don't want an adversarial relationship with this new leader.

1110
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You want him to support and help you.

1111
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
He will do that if you are making him look good.

1112
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
This is so easy, man.

1113
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
This is so easy and so hard because everybody's ego will get in the way.

1114
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Everybody's ego will get in the way.

1115
01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Extreme ownership often requires covert and clandestine indirect actions.

1116
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So all these things that I'm talking about helping the guy without him knowing,

1117
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.000
letting him take credit for ideas without him knowing.

1118
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
All these little aspects, they're indirect actions.

1119
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
They're not going to head to head. It's like you're just too.

1120
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
It's just too all the time. Everything's just too.

1121
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
You don't want to, if you know I'm going to do an arm bar, I'm not going to get the arm bar.

1122
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
You're going to defend that.

1123
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
So I have to go take indirect actions and set things up and take my time and be clandestine and covert.

1124
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
This is chess, not checkers.

1125
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
This is where you need to master your ability to influence,

1126
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
which as we talked about in a couple of podcasts, go as actually manipulation.

1127
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I'm manipulating this guy to think that he's got something over me.

1128
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I'm inflading his ego while I'm putting my ego in check.

1129
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I'm making him feel like he's even better.

1130
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And that makes him feel good. It makes him want to support me because I make him look good.

1131
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
This is just basic.

1132
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
If you do this wrong, the new manager will resist you at every turn.

1133
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:18.000
If you do this right, he will be your biggest supporter.

1134
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Now, this is the same thing with leaders that you quote and quote don't respect.

1135
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
First of all, there should be something that you respect about everybody.

1136
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Everybody that you meet, you should have some kind of respect for them.

1137
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And by the way, if you don't respect someone, what is making you not respect them?

1138
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It's your ego. It's your ego that makes you not respect people.

1139
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Did you think, oh, I'm better than them, I should have their job.

1140
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
They don't know what they're talking about and I do.

1141
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
That's all ego.

1142
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So put your ego in check and just be like, okay, this person's above me.

1143
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
They seem to like experience, but what kind of learn from them?

1144
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
How did they get there?

1145
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
If they're so dumb and bad at this job, how come they outrank me?

1146
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Let me learn something from them.

1147
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Let me learn something from them.

1148
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Put your ego in check.

1149
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And this is the key point.

1150
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And anytime I talk about quote unquote leading up the chain of command,

1151
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I will talk about this that no matter what boss I work for and I work for every different kind of boss.

1152
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
ego maniacs, psychopaths, wonderful guys, intelligent guys, brilliant guys, tacticians.

1153
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I work for every different kind of boss and I always had the same relationship with all of them.

1154
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
That was my job was to build that relationship and that was a relationship of high trust.

1155
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
So they trusted me, they were to stay out of my way, let me do what I wanted.

1156
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And that's how you win, which by the way, when you win, they should never know you win.

1157
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
They shouldn't even know that there was a competition happening.

1158
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And that way you can do what you want.

1159
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And so that is how you deal with people above you and the chain of command that you have a little respect for or that lead from a place of ego.

1160
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
You build a relationship with them.

1161
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
You don't go head to head with them, you're not going to win, go ahead to head with your boss.

1162
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
There you're boss, they have rank on you.

1163
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
If they're an ego maniac, they're going to use that rank.

1164
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
If there's someone that you don't respect, you got to build a relationship with them.

1165
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
If there's someone that's an ego maniac, you got to build a really regardless of the situation.

1166
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
The solution is the same.

1167
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Build the relationship of trust, help them build them up.

1168
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Take a back seat, let them get credit. It's all those things.

1169
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And once you do that, you're going to have much better results than if you're trying to bang heads with them, overcome them, defeat them, have an antagonistic relationship with them.

1170
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
It's never going to work.

1171
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
So play the game.

1172
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
You've been lifting heavy weights for many years.

1173
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Indeed, sir.

1174
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Now that you're in your mid 40s, are you still seeing gains in strength and muscle?

1175
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Well, yes, I am.

1176
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000
And as a matter of fact, I think one of the key kind of measurements of this is only a couple years ago.

1177
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I set my personal all-time record for pull-ups.

1178
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000
A couple years ago, maybe a year or two ago.

1179
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
So you did you do 63?

1180
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Yeah.

1181
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:32.000
So, but that being said, obviously you're going to go up and down.

1182
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000
So, and you don't, you can't continually set records on a daily basis.

1183
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
So what do I do and what's driving me?

1184
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So what I do is I'm constantly kind of going from goal to goal to goal.

1185
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And I get on a path where I'm trying to do something.

1186
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.000
I'll get into something, I'll read an article, or I'll see something, and I'll go, that looks cool.

1187
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That looks hard.

1188
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
That looks like a challenge.

1189
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Or I don't think I could do that, but I'm going to try.

1190
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Right.

1191
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
You know, so I'll say, okay, you know what?

1192
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Man, I haven't deadlift heavy in a while, I'm going to get my 500 pound deadlift on.

1193
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And so I'll just start focusing on the deadlift.

1194
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
And that's a bit of deadlift in every day, but I'm dead starting to go heavy.

1195
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Right.

1196
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Really working it, I'm starting to, all my, you know, maybe I'll be deadlifting a little more often.

1197
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I'll throw it in another day.

1198
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And I'll maybe I'll stop a little bit of that sprinting or a little bit of that high rep stuff.

1199
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
And I just start, you know, spending more time deadlifting.

1200
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And after a while, you know, maybe a month goes by, month and a half.

1201
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And I get where I want to be.

1202
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
So I get, I let's say I get to 500.

1203
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
You know, 500 deadlift feeling good.

1204
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Now, I could say, you know what?

1205
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I won't even get 525, right?

1206
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I could say that.

1207
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Yeah.

1208
01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:00.000
But if you think about what I'm going to have to do and anybody that lifts weights at all knows that the difference like the higher you go.

1209
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
The, the hargard is to increase a little bit more.

1210
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
And really, what, what are you getting out of that?

1211
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Like, like, in the real world, big picture, what are you getting out of it?

1212
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
What are you getting out of an extra?

1213
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
You got 500 pounds.

1214
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
You can deadlift.

1215
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
What are you getting out of an extra 25 pounds?

1216
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Yeah.

1217
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
The answer is, the answer is not a lot.

1218
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You know, the answer is no one will ever know the difference between you at 500 pound deadlift and you at 520 or 25.

1219
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
No one's going to know that difference when they roll with you.

1220
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
When they look at you, they're not going to know.

1221
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000
And you will have to sacrifice other parts of your physicality in order to get there.

1222
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You're going to be slower at real sprinting.

1223
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000
You're probably going to be heavier so you're going to be able to do less calisthenic workouts or less less repetitions in calisthenics.

1224
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So I'll get there.

1225
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And then once I get to like that good goal that I'm looking for, then I'll just shift to another goal.

1226
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I'll start looking at something else.

1227
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And, you know, whatever it's going to be a certain number of, you know, a 20 reps squat routine at a certain weight.

1228
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I'll start heading towards that or a certain number of muscle ups in a certain number of times.

1229
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Whatever the case may be, I'll do that.

1230
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
And that's what I've been doing for many, many years.

1231
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:24.000
And I never go so far down one path and become so specific that it takes away a bunch from the other areas.

1232
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Because at the end of the day, you know, I want to be well rounded.

1233
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah, I think that's, that's a mature.

1234
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I would say that's a mature pursuit right there.

1235
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Because when you're young, you want to, I mean, not you like everyone, but I'm just saying it's pretty general.

1236
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Pretty typical that when you're young, you want to get.

1237
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:56.000
You said these not want to bench them most I can possibly bench and you'll go or the dead left for example.

1238
01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
If you get 500 when you're younger, you want to get that 2525.

1239
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Yeah, you want to get that 535.

1240
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
You want to get that 555. And you don't really see it the big picture.

1241
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000
You don't see that that not only yeah, you're going to have to spend so much effort just to get that little gains,

1242
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
which no one's going to be able to tell unless you're going to competition.

1243
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Something like that is different.

1244
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
But not only are you spending that much time, you're avoiding time.

1245
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
You could be spending developing other aspects of your fitness.

1246
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
If you're talking about working out.

1247
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So I fell into this, and yeah, fell into the same thing about a year ago.

1248
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:37.000
When I was never really into conditioning in the gym, you know, like muscular conditioning and metabolic conditioning, never into that.

1249
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
But once you do that, you find that thing.

1250
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
There's so many gains I can achieve doing this type of stuff.

1251
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
When you know, you achieve the gains when I was young lifting weights and getting this big bench or big muscles or whatever.

1252
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.000
But when you're talking about like your physical body and fitness and stuff,

1253
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:04.000
you know, gains in strength and muscle, there's almost endless ways you can develop strength and muscle.

1254
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Or physical conditioning, you mean physically.

1255
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yeah, so strength and strength is, I mean, I know strength is defined, but really when you kind of talk about strength, that's like a general term.

1256
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Like you can even say his distance running is strong.

1257
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Like he has a strong effect of his game or whatever.

1258
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
That's not true.

1259
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000
He just struggles or usually knocks strong.

1260
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Yeah, but we'll just say his game is strong.

1261
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Just so conditioning.

1262
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah, it's good.

1263
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
It's good.

1264
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
It's like just what you call it.

1265
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:42.000
But either way, gains it in general, you know, and the more elements of physicality you have developed, the better off you're going to be.

1266
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Absolutely.

1267
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000
So yeah, if you, if you, so a lot of times when they talk about gains in strength and muscle, that means the numbers, yeah,

1268
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
500 and now I'm getting five, you know, I'm 40 now.

1269
01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000
And I still getting gains in strength and muscle, but there's so many other gains to get in all kinds of different physical activities.

1270
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And like I said, that's the mature way to pursue it is to pursue all those things.

1271
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And set a cool goal.

1272
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And when the diminishing returns start to come about, then you shift your goal.

1273
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Again, and then at the end of the day, you're going to end up the day.

1274
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:29.000
But the big picture of what you're going to end up with is this fully developed physicality that applies to way more things in life than they would if you're just trying to get that bench up or that deadlift up.

1275
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So yeah, you're, you're, you're pursued.

1276
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
That's, that's, that's a very eye-opening thing.

1277
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
I think I fell into it, but the way you put it, I think that's very important,

1278
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:44.000
especially when you start to get older, you know, when functioning overall is more important.

1279
01:52:44.000 --> 01:53:01.000
This is not something that I just started doing. I got older when we were young in the seal teams, we would do this. We'd be like, all right, we're going to get to bench 300 once we were benching 300, we'd say, all right, we're going to go and we'd be doing things like, hey, we're going to do the six mile run and extra time that we get that we'd say, oh, we're going to do 50 pull ups and then we get to that.

1280
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
So we've been doing this for a while.

1281
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah, and I think that, yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people that actually conduct themselves like that.

1282
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I know Tim Ferriss, kind of does that, and just even more so than Justin exercise just in a lot of in life. You know, he'll do that, he'll set a goal, he'll experience it,

1283
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:22.000
or, and then he'll shift it and do something else. And there's guys who, they kind of devote their life as almost like a hobby,

1284
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
but just a part of their life will build every year, they'll take on something new.

1285
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
That would like, I'm going to learn the guitar just this whole year, and then next year is something else or whatever.

1286
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Yeah, and more so than, I'm not necessarily saying that I think it comes with age.

1287
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
I'm just saying that's a mature way to, to get gains.

1288
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
It's a smart way to run your life.

1289
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Yes, yes, very smart.

1290
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:56.000
So next question, okay, you talk about people becoming aware as a leader.

1291
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
When did you become aware as a leader?

1292
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000
I think I've actually told this story before, but it was pretty clear memory to me.

1293
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I was doing I was a young, seal, probably in my first or second. It was actually my second platoon,

1294
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
and we were taking down an oil rig.

1295
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:22.000
And oil rigs are very complicated. There's a lot of, there's different levels to the oil rigs,

1296
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
and you can see through all the levels, because the floors are just made of great, basically.

1297
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:37.000
So you can see multiple different directions, 360 degrees, and there's all kinds of gear and equipment all over the different levels.

1298
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So it can be pretty complicated. Anyways, we came up onto this level, so I'm going to seal platoon,

1299
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:48.000
and we got 15 or 20 guys, and we come up onto this level, and everyone spreads out in a line,

1300
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
and we're looking at the level, and there's all kinds of complex stuff in front of us.

1301
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And we're trying to clear it, you know, you're looking for bad guys or whatever.

1302
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Again, this is just training, and as we're looking at everyone kind of freezes,

1303
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000
because there's so much complexity out there that everyone just kind of freezes.

1304
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Just because the physical layout, just the physical layout, it's just confusing and it looked confusing.

1305
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And complex, and so as I stood there, everyone froze.

1306
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And as everyone froze, I basically came offline and put my gun to high port,

1307
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000
and I said, hold left move right. So I was able to step back, look around, assess a good solution for the situation.

1308
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
And once I assess the situation, I just called out, what to do?

1309
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I said, hold left move right, which basically the guys on the left, stay where you're at,

1310
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
the guys on the right, we're going to move and do the clearance, and the guys did it.

1311
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And I realized right then, you know, like, wow, I can, I can kind of, I think I got this.

1312
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And it wasn't, then I didn't all of a sudden start trying to take charge of everything,

1313
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
because in the SEAL teams, you can't just, as a new guy, step up and start taking charge of stuff,

1314
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
you know, you'll get put in your place.

1315
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000
But I had that vision, and the vision that I actually had was that vision of the attachment,

1316
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:11.000
the vision of coming offline and stepping out of the tactical situation and realizing that when you step back,

1317
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
you can see everything, and that was like a miracle to me.

1318
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And once I realized that, it was always easy for me to do that from then on, and not only that,

1319
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
but it became easy for me to do that in regular life, and other things that I'm doing,

1320
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
and having conversations and dealing with relationships and making sure I'm not getting dragged down

1321
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:37.000
into these crazy relationships situations, or business situations,

1322
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
where there's a lot of emotion going on and saying, you know what,

1323
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I'm just going to step back and observe this from a better vantage point that's more unbiased.

1324
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Next question, what if you don't have a good mentor?

1325
01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So we talk about mentorship and how mentorship is important, and it's good to have mentors,

1326
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and I would agree it's good to have mentors, and if you can find them, and you can't always find them.

1327
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And so I think this individual that asks this question, what if you don't have a good mentor?

1328
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
What do you do?

1329
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And for me, it actually brings back my memories of when I first got to the seal teams,

1330
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:31.000
because when I first got to the seal teams, it was actually pretty hard to find a good mentor that I looked at and said,

1331
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
you know, I want to be like that person, and they were going to invest in you.

1332
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
So it was one thing to say, hey, that guy looks like a bad ass, and I want to be like them.

1333
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
That was easy.

1334
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:47.000
But to have someone that says, hey, listen, new guy, I'm going to invest in you and you know,

1335
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
make you into a great seal.

1336
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
That really wasn't happened.

1337
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000
You know, we had, first of all, the reason, some of the reasons it wasn't happening was because there was guys that were,

1338
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
you were on constant going on deployments, and so it wasn't like someone would grab you and pull you aside.

1339
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And when you got in a seal platoon, it became a little bit easier, and you'd usually find somebody that's going to at least take some interest in you.

1340
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:18.000
But the, like the Vietnam guys, they were around, but they were, you know, instructors and, or working in the training department.

1341
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
So they didn't, you weren't going to see them on a daily basis.

1342
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
They weren't going to mentor you.

1343
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
They weren't going to be there for you.

1344
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And I'll tell you not only that, but the guys that I went through training with and the guys that I ended up going to my first team with,

1345
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:41.000
we actually wanted to be more hardcore than what we saw.

1346
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
You know, we actually wanted to take it to another level.

1347
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000
And so to be honest with you, we kind of mentored ourselves.

1348
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And we set the standard of what we thought a seal was supposed to be like in our minds,

1349
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:10.000
and we started to act upon it. I mean, I remember we were doing the runs and the swims at the seal team with our full gear.

1350
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So like the guys at the team would be wearing sneakers and a pair of shorts,

1351
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
and we'd be wearing boots and a rucksack.

1352
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
And they would be looking at us like we were kind of crazy, you know,

1353
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
but that was us kind of mentoring ourselves.

1354
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And we did that with everything. You know, we were spending time at the team on the weekends.

1355
01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:34.000
We would inspect each other's gear over and over again and modify it and make sure it's square it away.

1356
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.000
And we were constantly trying to learn and teach each other different things.

1357
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I remember trying to teach each other about the different radios that they had and different kind of knots that we had learned.

1358
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
And so we were always just kind of mentoring ourselves.

1359
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000
And so I think, you know, that's the point is that if you can't find a good mentor,

1360
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
then you've got to become your own.

1361
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
And I think with the way the world is now,

1362
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
it's actually relatively easy to do that.

1363
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I mean, first of all, you can research what you want to be like.

1364
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
You can figure out who you want to be like,

1365
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
or maybe it's not who you want to be like,

1366
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000
but what aspects of other humans you can take.

1367
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And bring on board.

1368
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Now that is something I did with all kinds of seals.

1369
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
There was all kinds of bad ass seals that I said,

1370
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
that guy's really good at this.

1371
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And I'm going to try and get good at that too.

1372
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Or the way that guy acts in this situation is awesome.

1373
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And I'm going to try and act that way too.

1374
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So it wasn't like I was trying to be like them,

1375
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
but I was at least trying to emulate the best aspects of these different individuals.

1376
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
And I think there's a lot of examples out there today where you can do that.

1377
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
You can look for people to emulate.

1378
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
You can, I mean, on YouTube,

1379
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
you can basically find out how to do anything.

1380
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
In fact, you need to be careful that you,

1381
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.000
that you sanity check some of the people that you look into on that.

1382
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But I think that key really to mentoring yourself,

1383
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
it goes back to what we just talked about with detachment.

1384
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Because you need to,

1385
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
if you want to mentor yourself,

1386
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000
you got to be able to look yourself and you got to be able to look yourself in an honest way.

1387
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And that means you need to be able to detach yourself and observe yourself from that distant place.

1388
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
By distant, I mean, three feet.

1389
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
I mean, just from just outside of inside your own brain.

1390
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And if you detach, you can see where you're making mistakes.

1391
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And you can see what the long range you that you're striving for,

1392
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
you can see what it's going to take to get there.

1393
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And I think that's what, that's what I've done when I haven't had a mentor.

1394
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Is I've figured out a way to mentor myself?

1395
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And I think the goals that you set and the path that you draw out

1396
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000
and you detach yourself so that you can give yourself an honest observation of who you are and how you're doing.

1397
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And I think that is a good way to handle it.

1398
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Good job.

1399
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
All right.

1400
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
I think we'll do one more.

1401
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Right, last question.

1402
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Any thoughts on how to crank up the discipline?

1403
02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And where does discipline even come from?

1404
02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Where does discipline come from?

1405
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Just a classic question and whoever asks that question,

1406
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I would say, thank you for asking that question,

1407
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
where does discipline come from?

1408
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And the answer is actually pretty simple and pretty obvious.

1409
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Discipline comes from within.

1410
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It's an internal force.

1411
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Now sure, of course, you can have discipline imposed on you by some person,

1412
02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:16.000
like a drill instructor or like that self-help guru on TV.

1413
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:23.000
But the reality is that type of discipline isn't the real type of discipline that we're talking about.

1414
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
That discipline isn't as strong.

1415
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:30.000
It won't survive that imposed discipline that someone else is putting on you.

1416
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:43.000
What you're looking for and what you're talking about and what you need is self-discipline.

1417
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Self-discipline as the very term implies comes from the self.

1418
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
It comes from you.

1419
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:59.000
It comes from when you make a decision to be disciplined.

1420
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000
When you make a decision to be better,

1421
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.000
when you make a decision to do more and to be more.

1422
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Self-discipline comes when you decide that you're going to make a mark on the world.

1423
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:27.000
And if you think that you're not disciplined or you can't be disciplined,

1424
02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:33.000
it's because you haven't yet decided to be disciplined.

1425
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:40.000
It's because you haven't created that discipline yet.

1426
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:51.000
It's because you haven't become that discipline yet.

1427
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:59.000
So where does discipline come from? It comes from you.

1428
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:08.000
So make the decision, make the commitment, become the discipline,

1429
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:17.000
the discipline, the root quality that will improve every aspect of your life.

1430
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And it'll make you better and stronger and smarter and faster and healthier.

1431
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And most importantly, it'll make you free.

1432
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And that's pretty much all I've got for tonight.

1433
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000
