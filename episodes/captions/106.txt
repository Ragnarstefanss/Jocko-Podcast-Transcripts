[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 106 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:07] I go. Good evening. Now in podcast 105, we finished just as the 17 cab flew out of the
[00:00:20] hydrangea valley after keeping it together during a vicious three day fight where they suffered
[00:00:31] some massive casualties 79 killed an action, 121 wounded and on top of that the battle
[00:00:38] field was littered with enemy dead with the estimates of enemy dead to be between 500 and
[00:00:46] 1000 and we stopped there where the 17 cab left the battlefield so if you haven't listened to
[00:00:53] 105 yet go back and listen to that before continuing with this podcast 106 because even though
[00:01:04] the 17 left the battlefield the battle wasn't over yet and one of the events that I didn't
[00:01:11] really talk about in the first hydrangea podcast on 105 was the fact that two other battalions
[00:01:19] had arrived on the ground to reinforce the 17 and it was the second battalion fifth cavalry
[00:01:28] commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Tully and the second battalion seventh cavalry led by Lieutenant
[00:01:36] Colonel Robert McDade. Now most of the battalions men from those two battalions had landed
[00:01:46] at LZ Victor which was about two miles away from X-ray and they had patrolled to X-ray on foot
[00:01:54] arriving for the most part without incident and then things seemed to settle down or a lot
[00:02:00] of next-ray one seven left and once one seven had left the battlefield two seven and two five
[00:02:07] were still there so at that point that portion of the battle was over and two seven and two five
[00:02:17] could have likely been extracted via helicopter pretty securely just at one seven had been
[00:02:24] it seems that general west moorland did not like the idea of two seven and two five pulling out
[00:02:35] he thought that that would appear as a retreat so he ordered that two five and two seven
[00:02:42] secure LZ X-ray for the night and then the next day they would move by foot patrol to another LZ
[00:02:49] called LZ Albany which was about two point five miles to the north and then B-50-U bombers were
[00:02:57] going to rain down bombs on LZ X-ray and the surrounding areas they didn't expect a lot of resistance
[00:03:06] because things had settled somewhat down so much on LZ X-ray that if you remember even towards the
[00:03:13] end of the last podcast there was reporters came in and landed in LZ X-ray and were doing
[00:03:17] camera shots and interviewing people so it was pretty settled down they felt like it was over
[00:03:24] and they didn't expect much resistance on this movement from LZ X-ray to LZ Albany
[00:03:34] so let's go back to the book the book is We Were Soldiers once and Young by General Halmore and Joe
[00:03:40] Galaway and like I said there wasn't much resistance expected and here's what it says in the book
[00:03:48] the word among Bob McDades troopers was that it was going to be a walk in the sun
[00:03:54] a stroll over to another landing zone where the helicopters would come in and extract them the first
[00:03:59] leg of the journey home to on K-Base the word was wrong
[00:04:13] and these guys even though there hadn't been much fighting going on they were actually a little bit
[00:04:18] tired because they had been awake on the ground so here we go just before Alpha Company second
[00:04:24] battalion moved out it's commander captain Joe Sadini's put out an unusual order his executive officer
[00:04:35] Lieutenant Larry Gwyn who we're going to let hear a lot from Lieutenant Larry Gwyn remembers it well
[00:04:40] the company had been on 100% alert for over 52 hours we were in such a state of exhaustion
[00:04:46] that captain Sadini's directed that each man take two APC tablets aspirin with caffeine a move
[00:04:54] designed to increase the mental alertness of the troops so there you go take a little caffeine
[00:05:00] little aspirin get you guys get your heads in the game because they've been awake for a long
[00:05:04] time and again they're not expecting much but they still put on the ground you know hop LZ for a while
[00:05:09] back to the book Lieutenant Ali the battalion's communication officer was with headquarters company
[00:05:16] we were told that this would be a tactical move there was a lot of stuff on the battlefield equipment
[00:05:21] supplies captured stuff that had to be police to up and blown up all in a hurry up situation
[00:05:27] I was personally carrying an RC-292 antenna in addition to my regular combat load I weighed about
[00:05:35] 140 pounds my normal combat load was 40 or 50 pounds the 2 9 2 and 10 away 60 pounds
[00:05:43] the temperature must have been 96 and the humidity was the same we were moving as fast as we could
[00:05:49] through the elephant grass and scrub oaks some high canopy we were humping everyone was as tired as could be
[00:05:57] so we're already in a rough situation we've been on the ground for 52 hours and we're going to move
[00:06:05] two and a half miles doesn't sound very far but when you're carrying so he's already
[00:06:09] he's carrying a hundred pounds it's 40 and 50 pound combat load plus his antenna and everyone else is
[00:06:12] carrying all kinds of extra stuff that they're pulling off the LZ it's 96 degrees out 96%
[00:06:18] humidity and walking through the jungle is never easy it's up and down little terrain features
[00:06:23] going through various foliage is hard so this is not easy not the biggest guy too by the
[00:06:32] 140 150 pounds which guys were smaller back then yeah but still they are now bar pal yeah no
[00:06:37] 100 pounds that's that's no joke that's no joke back to the book lieutenant Gary Gwyn of Alpha
[00:06:44] company says the jungle around us got heavier and heavier that's when things got a little scary
[00:06:51] there was a sudden absence of any air cover the guys were silent and I wondered where our
[00:06:57] helos and our aerial rocket artillery ships were we had not changed formation tactically
[00:07:03] but physically we had to move in much tighter to maintain visual contact because of the undergrowth
[00:07:09] the terrain forced our flaker flankers in so at this point they're they they had a bunch of
[00:07:14] air cover they don't have any air cover right now and now the terrain is making them get closer
[00:07:19] and closer together because if you and I are on patrol I don't I want to keep you in visual range
[00:07:26] I want to be able to see you and so if all the sun there's elephant grass will the only way to
[00:07:30] to keep visual of use for you to get close to me and for immediate close to the next guy and so
[00:07:34] everyone starts compressing he's talking about the flankers being out there a lot of times when
[00:07:38] we patrol in formation you'll put people out on the flanks with individual range but that'll be
[00:07:44] stretching the visual range but they're out there to make sure that there's no one sneaking up on you
[00:07:48] and so they've that it's getting dense now to the point where they can't keep their flankers out so now
[00:07:54] you're losing some of that flank security back to the book Gwen says alpha companies column order
[00:08:00] integrity had been good until two prisoners were captured and everything came to a sudden halt
[00:08:08] when I arrived so genies so genies was interrogating the two they were mint condition
[00:08:15] new weapons grenades new gear but both were feverish terrified and shaking none of us in
[00:08:22] company headquarters had seen alive north Vietnamese up close these were not the last we would see
[00:08:28] this day we gave them water and advised the battalion headquarters so all of a sudden they got a
[00:08:33] couple of prisoners little scary to me when the prisoners that we take have brand new weapons
[00:08:39] new grenades new gear I mean we at least know that they're fresh maybe they're not combat hardened
[00:08:44] but we know that they've got some good well supplied which is a scary thing in this type of war
[00:08:52] so this is this is kind of weird looking back hindsight of course being 2020 this is this is an
[00:09:00] error or a or a mistake that gets made right now and of course mistakes happen all the time
[00:09:06] and they they don't get capitalized on by the enemy sometimes by luck sometimes by skill of the enemy
[00:09:12] this is one of those mistakes that it gets capitalized again whether it's by luck or plan
[00:09:18] probably by luck maybe it's a little bit of both you wouldn't think much of it if things didn't
[00:09:23] go the way they did you know late late for now you stabbed this conversation a lot I mean
[00:09:27] you don't know when things are going to go wrong and and seriously you can be on the battlefield
[00:09:33] and you can you can say hey everyone go left and everyone goes left and everything turns out great
[00:09:38] or you can say everyone go right and everyone go right and everyone thing turns out great
[00:09:43] if you go left then you happen to go to where the enemy was waiting in ambush for you to go
[00:09:48] now you're you just made a bad tactical call the thing that made it a bad tactical calls that the
[00:09:52] enemy happened to be there you couldn't know that and if you'd been if you'd said go right
[00:09:57] well you'd great made the greatest call ever because the enemy was over there waiting for again
[00:10:01] you don't know where the enemy's gonna be don't have that luxury so sometimes you make the best
[00:10:05] tactical decision you can make and it turns out bad now we can look back at this hindsight being 2020
[00:10:11] of course and and critique what's about to happen so we'll we'll we'll talk a little bit more about it
[00:10:17] here's what goes down back to the book Captain George Forest commander of Alpha Company first
[00:10:21] baton fifth cavalry was more than 500 yards to the rear so these guys are in a long column of
[00:10:26] march group of people
[00:10:28] middaydast all the company commanders to come forward so middaydast the company is the baton
[00:10:35] commander he tells all the companies commanders to come forward so he's middayd's up at the
[00:10:40] front of this column and who knows how big they are you know he says he's 500 yards the rear of this
[00:10:44] whole thing probably spanned out probably six 700 maybe even 800 meters we're getting close to a
[00:10:51] kilometer in length of people to spread out just so everyone understands it's hard to control 40
[00:11:00] guys in a in a line of march with any kind of control that spread out over 200 meters that's challenging
[00:11:08] you get 500 600 guys spread out over almost a kilometer we have a serious command and control issue
[00:11:16] so now what he's doing to overcome this issue is telling all the all the company commanders so
[00:11:21] there's three companies that are out there actually there's more than that but there's multiple
[00:11:26] companies out there he tells all the company commanders hey come to my position at the front of
[00:11:30] this thing so we can talk about what's happening back to the book Captain Fezmire the Charlie
[00:11:36] Company commander was also moving up the count column to toward McDades position with him or his
[00:11:43] two radio operators his artillery his artillery forward exor observer lieutenant Sidney Smith
[00:11:49] and his radio men as well as fur first sergeant Franklin Hans so so I want you to think about that
[00:11:56] or let me explain this to you a little bit more here's the Charlie Company commander he's moving
[00:12:01] forth so he's leaving his company and with him he brings his two radio operators so who does that
[00:12:09] leave with the company there might be one paltoon guy left that's a radio operator maybe one
[00:12:15] an each paltoon but there there's he's pulling the the communications node out of the company
[00:12:22] right there he brings forward his artillery observer so this is the guy that's going to be
[00:12:27] able to place artillery other guys can pick up the slack but not as well as this guy can do it
[00:12:34] he brings lieutenant Sidney Smith and his radio men so that means that so sorry the the artillery
[00:12:39] observer is lieutenant Sidney Smith but that guy brings his radio men as well so there's another guy
[00:12:44] out of the loop and then the first sergeant the company first sergeant so now that's the leadership
[00:12:50] the company leadership is now from from Charlie Company is now gone they're moving up forward to talk
[00:12:55] about it and so here they give a kind of an overview of what's going on here it is this is
[00:13:03] what back to the book this is what was happening Sudanese alphar company was moving forward toward
[00:13:09] the albany clearing so they've they've now a pro they're kind of approached this this LZ Albany that's
[00:13:14] what they're talking about the albany clearing um alphar company the sygini's alphar company was
[00:13:20] moving toward the albany clearing Colonel McDade and his batain command group were with alphar company
[00:13:26] the other company commanders had left their companies under orders and were moving up to
[00:13:32] join McDade for a conference so the other company commanders are not with their companies anymore
[00:13:38] the batain was strong out along the line of march for a distance of at least 550 yards so half a
[00:13:44] kilometer the men of delta company were lulling around on the ground Charlie company had flankers
[00:13:51] off to each side but were mostly taking a break sitting or lying down George forus men at the tail
[00:13:57] of the column were in a wedge formation and also had flank security posted the men of batain were
[00:14:02] worn out after nearly 60 hours without sleep and four hours of marching through difficult terrain
[00:14:08] visibility in the chest high elephant grass was very limited
[00:14:16] that situation to be in here's lieutenant going talking we had been there a short time five minutes
[00:14:24] when i heard some rounds fired near our first platoon i thought they must have caught up with
[00:14:28] those NVA stragglers then everything opened up opened up the firing just crescendoed they hadn't
[00:14:36] found the stragglers they had run right into the north Vietnamese i was out in the grass away from
[00:14:42] the trees when it started the rounds were so fast and for years overhead they were knocking bark
[00:14:47] off the trees i ran to them one round struck the tree i was crouch next to and inch over my head i
[00:14:53] said holy shit and ran to join Joel we all got down then i heard the sickening whump of mortar fire
[00:15:00] landing where i had seen our second platoon disappear the most savage one day battle of the
[00:15:08] Vietnam war had just begun the second battalion seventh cavalry had walked into a hornet's nest
[00:15:15] the north Vietnamese reserve force the 550 man eight battalion 66 regimen had been bivouacct in the
[00:15:24] woods off to the northeast of nicknades column so you've got fresh soldiers that had been waiting
[00:15:31] they were the reserves that whole earlier battle in the hydrang with the one seven calf this this
[00:15:37] Vietnamese group the 66 regimen eight battalion 66 regimen had been waiting in reserve
[00:15:43] and now they just so happened to be in the line of march where these uh where the two five is coming
[00:15:50] through or sorry the two seven is coming through here's what Colonel Anne who again this was the
[00:16:00] Vietnamese commander here's what he had to say i think this fight of November 17th was the most
[00:16:06] important of the entire campaign i gave the order to my battalions when you meet the americans
[00:16:12] divide yourself into many groups and attack the column from all directions and divide the
[00:16:17] column into as many pieces move inside the column grab them by the belt and thus avoid casualties
[00:16:25] from the artillery and air we had some advantages now for let me just talk about that one real quick
[00:16:32] okay two things first of all get the battalion split up right and if you hear and i always talk
[00:16:38] about the common theme of keeping things together keeping people consolidated keeping your groups where
[00:16:42] they can mutually support each other his goal is the opposite that get them split up so they can't
[00:16:47] support each other that's number one so contrary to that what you should always be doing as a
[00:16:52] leader is trying to keep your forces as consolidated as possible so that they can they can maneuver
[00:16:57] well together and most important support each other to cover move hmm now the second part of this
[00:17:02] is move inside the column grab them by the belt and thus avoid casualties from artillery and air
[00:17:08] that's something that we still see to this day we talked about it with the session conflict that
[00:17:14] was the sessions mode of operand motors operand i to take to get inside and be right next to the
[00:17:21] Russians they call it hugging they would get in there and and get in the same building as the Russians
[00:17:25] so you can't call fire on your own building so that's what the that's what the Vietnamese
[00:17:30] were trying to do now what's beautiful about these statements think about these two statements
[00:17:34] this is beautiful commanders intent here's all i want you to do split them up get close to them
[00:17:42] that's what i want you to do he's not saying how to do he's not telling each individual
[00:17:46] group where to move and what to do he is hands split them up and get close to him and stay close
[00:17:51] to him this is gives the guys on the battlefield incredible flexibility to execute that plan
[00:18:02] we had some advantages on continuing we had some advantages we attacked your column from the
[00:18:07] sides at the moment of attack we were waiting for you this was our reserve battalion and they were
[00:18:13] just waiting for their turn the eight battalion had not been used in fighting in this campaign
[00:18:18] they were fresh spec for dick acumen was the right flank point man in the recon platoon
[00:18:25] which was itself the point of the battalion says acumen we were going to the left to a clearing
[00:18:31] we had gone about a hundred feet when he heard some shots then more shots and finally all
[00:18:36] hell broke loose the main brunt of the attack was right where we had been standing just a few minutes
[00:18:42] before we hit the dirt i was laying in the middle of a clearing and bullets were kicking dirt in my
[00:18:48] eyes and breaking off the grass acumen's first sergeant was standing shouting and giving directions
[00:18:57] his shirt was off and he was in a t-shirt he lifted his left arm to point and i could see
[00:19:01] were a bullet and ripped them ripped open the side of his arm and part of the side of his chest
[00:19:06] he was still giving orders we were then ordered to another part of the circle that was weak
[00:19:12] it was facing the main area of attack there were people running everywhere we couldn't just open
[00:19:17] fire in that direction because our guys were there we were on semi automatic and picking off
[00:19:22] whoever we could be sure of as a target so this just turns into immediately into chaos and again
[00:19:32] this is why consolidation of your forces is so important because the minute you have enemy in
[00:19:38] between you and other friendly forces your field of fire is completely shut off and you're likely
[00:19:42] when you are pulling the trigger you have a good chance you're going to shoot some of your own
[00:19:47] guys so that's again why consolidation of forces is very very important now i say this all the time
[00:19:54] i'll make the caveat again are there times where you can get away with with splitting your forces
[00:19:58] and there are other times that it makes sense yes absolutely there are times that it makes sense and
[00:20:02] we did all kinds of operations overseas where we had different units out on the battlefield that
[00:20:07] were split up and maneuvering from different areas we did all the time but you have to know and
[00:20:12] understand the risks you have to know and understand the risks of splitting forces of having
[00:20:18] enemy in between of trying to consolidate back together which is very very difficult you just have
[00:20:24] to really think about what the risks are and how you can mitigate those risks sometimes you can do
[00:20:28] with a terrain feature you can put guys in a certain area where hey i have free fire because you're
[00:20:34] down behind a null or you're in a ravine where i know that i can't shoot you that's the type of
[00:20:40] thing that you can do to mitigate but it is something that people think they can get away with
[00:20:46] and you know matter of fact we were doing FTX and it was interesting we had one of the
[00:20:52] females during the planning phase we we have them plan just a a couple operations just to sort of
[00:21:00] get used to planning before we start the actual FTX this is for those of you don't know we have
[00:21:06] a company called national and front and sometimes we do field training exercises with the companies
[00:21:11] we're working with to get them to help instill in them the fundamental principles of combat leadership
[00:21:20] so it was funny this this one female she had come up with this plan and they were going to
[00:21:26] enter this target building from two different directions talking about the classroom course
[00:21:29] yes the classroom course that they did and she actually i said you know we've said keep it simple
[00:21:36] and it can be a little bit confusing if you start entering a building from two different sides
[00:21:40] and you're now you've got guns pointed at each other and you know you've got to be careful
[00:21:46] that you don't shoot each other and and she literally said i just don't see how it's going to happen
[00:21:53] that we could go into this building and we're just going to start shooting each other yeah of course
[00:22:00] inside and said okay and and literally the next day during the FTX phase of the training
[00:22:08] which we're using airsoft weapons and you're shooting at bad guys they came up with a plan
[00:22:17] entered a building from two sides and she entered the building and literally shot one of her own
[00:22:23] people she did exactly what she didn't think could happen yeah and and that's what people
[00:22:27] have to understand now you might think oh well it's this girl or this female and she was she's not a
[00:22:32] military person and it's you know that's why it happened no i saw seals do it on the regular
[00:22:38] you're all hyped up you go in that room you see a person moving crack crack them fire a couple shots
[00:22:45] and then you realize what happened so so that's what's going on here split forces things are going
[00:22:53] crazy now here we go acrimans back to the book acrimans recomplitude leader lieutenant pain
[00:23:03] he says all hell broke loose up along the north side of the lz i turned to my right and observed
[00:23:08] some american soldiers moving toward the northwest to set up positions and they went down in a hail of bullets
[00:23:13] within minutes we were all under heavy attack and my radio operator and i were pinned down in the
[00:23:18] middle of the lz with the most of the fire with most of the fire coming from the north and north west
[00:23:25] lieutenant pain's radio opera came alive as the alpha company platoon leaders reported heavy
[00:23:30] fighting pain says mortar rounds began falling which was a new experience to everyone since we had
[00:23:35] never had any kind of mortar fire against us the noise level was unbelievable i remember pressing my
[00:23:42] body flatter against the ground and i have ever been in my life and thinking that certainly the
[00:23:46] highest thing sticking up were my heels mortars continue to fall in small arms and machine gun fire
[00:23:54] continue to hectic pace finally my mind seemed to adjust and i once again began to think about the
[00:24:01] situation we were in and what we were going to do so you see there's a leader he's pinned down
[00:24:06] and this is something that the the insurgents and i rack would do as well they're going to hit you
[00:24:12] with multiple different weapon systems you know in a combined coordinated attack so if you can imagine
[00:24:17] if you start hitting people with mortars well everyone needs to get down you need to get down
[00:24:22] you need to take cover wall you're taking cover that's that's cover they're going to move
[00:24:27] they're going to maneuver in they're going to maneuver in with with heavy weapons or they're going to
[00:24:30] move maneuver in with an assault squad or they're going to maneuver in with a vehicle born i ed so this is
[00:24:35] same thing happening here as you're getting mortars which these guys aren't used to which
[00:24:38] there's not that there's that much you can do to get used to it because it doesn't matter
[00:24:42] it doesn't help you defend it you can be used to it you still have to get down you still have to take cover
[00:24:46] these guys are taking cover and what i found interesting about this was you can see in his
[00:24:53] mind for a couple seconds maybe 30 seconds he's just going holy crap i'm going to die
[00:24:59] and then finally he says my mind seemed to adjust and once again he'd be in think about the situation
[00:25:03] we were in and what we're going to do now this is where combat experience is helpful if you haven't
[00:25:08] been in the situation before it's going to take you a few seconds to adapt and be like oh dang i need to
[00:25:13] do something if you haven't been in that situation before you could end up with some you're it's
[00:25:19] going to take you some time to adjust and it's like we talk about with self defense with jiu jitsu
[00:25:23] if you've never been grabbed before and you've never been ground on before you've never had
[00:25:29] humble someone pulled you before it's your mind set takes time just to get through that before you even
[00:25:35] start thinking about actually defending yourself you're just getting used you're just saying
[00:25:38] a whole crap wise is happening however you train all the time then you're used to it you go oh okay
[00:25:44] someone's got me here's where we're going to get out same thing with getting punched in the face if
[00:25:48] you've never been punched in the face before it takes some getting used to you're going to get
[00:25:51] punch three four five times before you're like wait a second i need to defend myself
[00:25:55] if you've been punched before boom oh i just got punched here's my reaction here's what i'm
[00:25:59] gonna do and you're speaking of jiu jitsu going back to getting inside that's the same thing
[00:26:04] getting close to someone what they were trying to do what the north of you to me is we're trying
[00:26:08] to get close stay close that's the same thing that jiu jitsu is you're trying to avoid the big
[00:26:12] punches you get in close you stay close you keep the person close to you that's how you avoid
[00:26:16] getting knocked out same thing so train train hard
[00:26:22] back to the book alpha companies alpha company alpha companies commander captain sugenis
[00:26:30] was in the trees headed to where he had seen the batain command group disappear
[00:26:35] just as i noticed a small clearing up ahead i heard one or two shots to my rear
[00:26:39] back where my first and second platoons were i looked back there was a pause of several seconds
[00:26:44] and then slowly all hell began to break loose i remember if we were reading the book
[00:26:53] by early pile and he talked about the expression all hell broke loose because we we just heard it like
[00:26:59] five times yeah and he's talking about how it gets overused but it's real and you can tell
[00:27:05] with these guys it's it's just absolutely real that all hell is breaking loose and i want to say
[00:27:11] this too because i didn't mention this about date miqdeid who's the batain commander miqdeid is
[00:27:17] the batain commander he had just taken over the battalion like a few weeks before and he had moved
[00:27:22] from some admin position inside the inside the the the i don't know if it's inside the battalion
[00:27:30] or inside the brigade but he had moved from like a sort of an administrative position into battalion
[00:27:36] command so in other words he wasn't charge of in charge of any troops and then all of a sudden
[00:27:40] he was in charge of troops and then three weeks later they're going into combat now that being said
[00:27:46] he also said that this guy hadn't been in charge of any troops in like ten years so he
[00:27:51] he he apparently done his platoon commander in his company command in world war two in Korea so
[00:27:57] miqdeid is an experienced combat leader but he's out of practice he's out of practice and more
[00:28:04] probably more important or just as important to to being out of practice is he just took over
[00:28:09] so part of being a battalion commander is that you train and prepare your troops for combat you get
[00:28:16] to know all your men you get to understand their weaknesses you just can't jump in and take over
[00:28:21] and all of a sudden have the knowledge that you would have if you were preparing everyone that's why
[00:28:25] training is so important that's why we train so if you are if you are not given the opportunity
[00:28:32] to train and learn your troops you're at a huge disadvantage you're at and you haven't had time
[00:28:37] to train them up to the your standards you know this guy was in World War II and Korea he
[00:28:43] understands combat and so to think that he wouldn't put his guys through a you know a certain
[00:28:48] level of training to get them up to speed and make sure they do things like like make sure that there's
[00:28:54] other people in the chain of command that can step up and lead having a succession plan so
[00:28:58] so like him calling people forward maybe if he had trained the battalion he knew that there was
[00:29:03] other guys in there that would be able to take charge he didn't realize that there was like a little
[00:29:06] little hesitation there that was gonna happen which is what happened yeah so he doesn't know his
[00:29:12] his team well enough for this situation and that's not good
[00:29:22] back to the book captain so genie says Larry going and I hit the edge of Albany on the
[00:29:28] northeast side of the clearing as the column began to receive intense fire we began to receive
[00:29:33] sporadic sniper fire part of the recompletoon had already reached the island of the island
[00:29:38] they're talking about as an island of wood's an island of trees I yelled across the opening for
[00:29:43] someone to cover us we ran to the island at this point I called my first and second platoons on the radio
[00:29:48] almost immediately I lost communications with first platoon the platoon sergeant for the second platoon
[00:29:54] came on the radio that was sergeant first class William A. Ferrell 38 from Stanton Tennessee
[00:30:01] he was a veteran of World War II and Korea had been a prisoner of war in Korea and could have chosen
[00:30:08] to remain in the states he did not have to deploy with Vietnam with us everyone called him
[00:30:15] papi Ferrell kept asking captain sergeini's where he was telling him that they were mixed up with
[00:30:22] the north Vietnamese and had several wounded and killed I couldn't pinpoint his location I knew
[00:30:28] where he should have been directly east of our island papi then radio that he was hit that there
[00:30:35] were three or four men with him all hit I could hear the firing at his location over the radio
[00:30:42] I never heard from papi again he did not survive
[00:30:47] this confusion that happened this is far go war stuff this is this complete far go war stuff
[00:30:58] and by the way the enemy gets a vote the enemy gets a vote the enemy can do things like this
[00:31:04] that you don't expect the enemy can hit you from multiple sides the enemy can have a strategy
[00:31:09] to get or attack to getting close that's what the enemy is going to do
[00:31:12] you don't know what the enemy is going to do actually you don't know what they're going to do
[00:31:20] you don't know they're going to have mortars this time
[00:31:25] back to the book lieutenant Colonel McDade himself recalls when things began happening I got in
[00:31:30] without for company I know I was trying to figure out what was going on I moved very fast let's get
[00:31:37] over there in those trees and let's all get together the enemy seemed to be all over the woods
[00:31:44] we had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure out where everybody else
[00:31:50] was one of the things I was very concerned with was people being trigger happy and just shooting up
[00:31:57] the grass I was telling them make sure you know what you're shooting at because we are scattered
[00:32:02] so notice how he says this we had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure
[00:32:08] out where everyone else is this is horrible it shows you two things when you have good tight control
[00:32:14] over people you're okay if you know where your people are you're okay there's the one of the
[00:32:19] worst feelings on the battlefield is not knowing where your guys are that is one of the worst
[00:32:26] feelings on the battlefield not knowing where your guys are and sitting there trying to figure out
[00:32:32] where everyone else is which I guess those two are the same things and so the biggest concern that
[00:32:39] he has right now is like he's so concerned about friendly fire keep control your people
[00:32:50] back to the book the battalion operations officer captain spires believes that the the fact that
[00:32:55] the commanders were absent from their companies when the fight started contributed to the confusion
[00:33:01] it had the most effect I think on Charlie company their commander captain skip festmire was up with
[00:33:08] us and Don Cornet the Charlie company executive officer was killed early on so they had no commander
[00:33:15] and they just disintegrated so leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield
[00:33:22] talk about that all the time this is why this is why when you see a platoon or a company that doesn't
[00:33:29] have any leadership they fall apart now if you are well trained and if you have a good
[00:33:36] succession plan and if you've done drills where the company commander gets killed and you take
[00:33:39] them out other people have to step up and lead yes that is how you prepare for these situations
[00:33:44] you have to prepare for those situations you have to prepare for leaders to go down
[00:33:48] but if you have no one that steps up you're going to be in a real hard way real fast
[00:33:59] back to the book the entire area is now alive with north Vietnamese soldiers who had obviously
[00:34:05] cut through the battalions line of march severing the head of the battalion from the body
[00:34:10] go in saw three jia jia is coming through the high grass running from the area swarming with enemy
[00:34:17] I jumped up and screamed to them waving my arm they saw me and headed directly to our position
[00:34:23] the first man was a captain our air force forward air controller who is completely spent
[00:34:28] I pointed out the battalion command group which was huddled to our rear at the at another
[00:34:32] ant hill and he crawled toward them he was followed by the battalion sergeant major Jim Scott
[00:34:38] who dropped down next to me and Scott was followed by a young very small pfc who was delirious
[00:34:44] and holding his guts in with his hands he kept asking are the helicopters coming I said yes hang on
[00:34:55] the battalion commander initially thought that the incoming rounds were all friendly fire
[00:35:01] so think about that the battalion commander initially thought that the incoming rounds were all
[00:35:07] friendly fire so what does reaction take cover don't wish you back which is actually
[00:35:13] if you're getting maneuvered on by an enemy the worst possible thing you can do is take cover
[00:35:17] and not shoot back because that means the enemy is going to maneuver faster on you back to the
[00:35:21] book he had been hollering for all of us to cease fire and the word went out over the command net
[00:35:26] but to no avail as the troops on the perimeter could see north Vietnamese
[00:35:30] the can you imagine the confusion you've got the battalion commander on the command net yelling
[00:35:37] to everyone to cease fire meanwhile you can literally see north Vietnamese and you're shooting and
[00:35:41] engaging them this is this is meham the sergeant major and I were looking to the rear when I
[00:35:47] heard a loud blast the sergeant major yelled I'm hit he had taken around in the back
[00:35:52] under his armpit and there was a large hole underneath his right arm I told him he would be okay
[00:35:58] to bandage it himself this he did ripping off his shirt then he picked up his M16 and
[00:36:05] headed back to one of the ant hills I saw the sergeant major a few times after that and he was fighting
[00:36:10] like a demon sergeant major Scott says I took a bullet through my chest not more than 15 or 20 minutes
[00:36:18] into the battle I could see enemy soldiers to our left right and front in the in platoon and company
[00:36:23] size elements they were up in trees up on top of ant hills and in the high grass we weren't exactly
[00:36:30] organized we didn't have time everything happened all at once I didn't see a whole being dug up
[00:36:36] prior to 8pm that night we did use the trees and ant hills for cover within a half an hour there
[00:36:43] was an attempt to organize groups into defense a position in a company area individuals did this
[00:36:49] no one in particular I think that's what saved us so this is decentralized command coming out
[00:36:57] you the only thing that gets them together is that individuals stepped up and said okay we need
[00:37:02] to form a perimeter defense now unfortunately half an hour an hour had already passed when they got to
[00:37:07] this point where the individual start making the call the other thing is there's a lack of overall
[00:37:13] direction so you get to a point where if everyone knew hey here's the position we're going to be in
[00:37:20] the battalion here's our formation if something happens here's what we're going to do we're going to
[00:37:24] bound towards this area you there's all kinds of contingency plans that could have been done here
[00:37:28] no again I'm doing hindsight 2020 which I hate doing but we are trying to learn
[00:37:35] and we are trying to talk to all the military people that are listening to this that are out doing
[00:37:40] operations right now think about this and I had this probably told this story before but when we first
[00:37:48] got to Ramadi my one of the junior officers was taking a patrol out and it was a combined
[00:37:58] patrol with some Iraqi soldiers and some seals and he was going over the patrol route with me
[00:38:03] and he got to this big open field and he said yeah I'm going to go we have to go across this
[00:38:08] field because it's only way to get from here to there and I said what are you going to do when you
[00:38:11] get this open field he said what we're going to get across it that's how you're going to get across it
[00:38:16] and he said well we're going to walk across it I said what if you get hit and he didn't really have
[00:38:20] any answer I said okay so here's what you're going to do leave some guys in the tree line over here
[00:38:25] have these guys bound across to this little dark right here then those guys can join them
[00:38:29] cover move just cover move across this field and that's what they did and sure enough they actually
[00:38:34] got hit they got hit with a pretty significant attack and with more resistance small long fire and
[00:38:39] they covered moved out of the situation but my point is looking at the terrain beforehand having a plan
[00:38:46] and the next cut in the plan and dictating the situation you're going to be it instead of letting
[00:38:50] the situation dictate what happens to you don't do that it's not a good answer situation
[00:38:57] dictates that's not a good we dictate this situation talked about it before
[00:39:01] and then have your like the Vietnamese command was very broad the commanders intent get close
[00:39:10] split them up these guys didn't have a command like that what could the opposite command would
[00:39:15] been stick together stick together keep integrity well there you go don't let them in close okay there you go
[00:39:25] back to the book Sudanese and Gwen are agree that it was not long after this at the
[00:39:37] Alph the commander of Alphacompanese missing second platoon lieutenant Gordon Grove staggered
[00:39:41] into the American position from the east here's Larry going talking I saw Gordon Gordon
[00:39:45] Gordon Grove coming across the field along with two wounded men they were the only ones left of
[00:39:51] this platoon who could move Grove was distraught we got him and his two men with us and our
[00:39:58] got our men ex working on the wounded then Gordon asked for men to go back with him to get his people
[00:40:05] Joe Shadini's said Gordon I can't send anybody about else back out there it was clear that to leave
[00:40:12] this perimeter was deaf everywhere you looked you could see north Vietnamese Gordon asked for
[00:40:19] permission to go talk to the battalion commander so Jeanne said go ahead he jogged over
[00:40:25] asked me to aid for help to get his men got a negative response so he came back to our
[00:40:30] handheld so this is one of those classic examples you hear about all time people will try and get you in the
[00:40:39] the catch twenty two question like the got you question what what would you do if you were in the
[00:40:43] situation and you some of you guys were still out there but you didn't have enough people to go
[00:40:47] get him or you were being overwhelmed what would you do well here's what these guys did right here
[00:40:51] they'll know you can't go get him if you send in more people out there they're gonna die if they
[00:40:56] did if we send 10 guys out there 15 guys out there 18 guys out there to go recover the splin we're
[00:41:00] gonna lose 18 more guys we're gonna stay put we're in fight as best we can from here we'll get fire
[00:41:05] superiority back we'll get our shit together and then we'll go get these guys go in ads there was
[00:41:14] a tremendous battle going on in the vicinity of where we had come into the clearing and beyond
[00:41:19] there in the jungle it was Charlie company caught in the killing zone of the ambush fighting for
[00:41:25] its life the mortar fire had ceased the enemy tubes apparently had been overrun by Charlie company
[00:41:31] because we found them all the next day but there were still hundreds of North Vietnamese
[00:41:35] calmly walking around the area we were observing now began the sniping phase of our battle
[00:41:42] I call it that because for a long period of time all we did was pick off enemy wandering around
[00:41:47] our perimeter and this last until we started getting air support everything that had happened to
[00:41:52] this point had probably taken less than 30 minutes
[00:42:01] Gwen saw major frank Henry the batalion executive officer lying on his back using the radio
[00:42:05] trying desperately to get some tactical air support and succeeding the air was on the way but
[00:42:10] there was no artillery or aerial rocket artillery yet Jim Spires the S3 ran over to us and
[00:42:18] queried Gordon Grove Gordon Grove as the situation outside the perimeter where he had just come from
[00:42:24] Grove told him there were still men out there tightened into a small perimeter but they were all
[00:42:29] wounded and dying and the radio has had all been knocked out Captain Spires asked a second time
[00:42:34] if he thought anyone would still alive and none of us said anything
[00:42:38] Gwen climbed up top a termite hill and began sniping at the North Vietnamese visible across
[00:42:45] the clearing in the trees to the south with Xem 16 rifle there were plenty of targets and I
[00:42:50] remember picking off 10 or 15 NVA from my position my memories revolve around the way in which
[00:42:56] each enemy soldier fell that I hit someone simply limp slump limply to the ground some reacted
[00:43:03] as if they had been hit by a truck some that I missed on the first and second shots kept on
[00:43:09] milling around until I finally hit them what we did not know at the time was that they were wandering
[00:43:15] around the elephant grass looking for Americans who were still alive and killing them off one by one
[00:43:26] North Vietnamese soldiers climbed into trees and on top of those brush covered termite hills
[00:43:31] and poured fire down on the cavalry troops troopers trapped in the tall grass below them in
[00:43:36] the main body of the column there was serious firing including mortar fire both from both sides
[00:43:44] the strike at the head of the column was followed so quickly by the enemy encircling
[00:43:48] assaults that the whole business seemed to erupt almost simultaneously without doubt some of
[00:43:55] some platoons of mixtades battalion were alert and in as secure a formation as they could achieve
[00:44:02] in the elephant grass brush and fix scrub trees but the visibility problem made it difficult to
[00:44:08] maintain formation and one result was that American troop for closer to one another then was
[00:44:14] tactically sound providing juicy granite juicy targets for a grenade mortar round or a burst from
[00:44:20] AK 47 rifle all down the column platoon leaders sergeants radio operators and riflemen by the
[00:44:28] dozens were killed or wounded in the first 10 minutes rapidly degrading communication cohesion and control
[00:44:41] to this whole thing that we've talked about up in this poem is like a half an hour just a brutal
[00:44:45] onslaught that kicked off with massive violence of action Captain Fesmire adds the result was
[00:44:55] very intense individual hand to hand combat in the confusion I had no idea exactly where the
[00:45:04] company was located when lieutenant cornet died it was virtually impossible for me to talk to
[00:45:09] anyone in my company the battle had clearly become an individual struggle for life again that was
[00:45:24] the goal of the Vietnamese was to make it an individual struggle was to get in close was to separate
[00:45:30] people from the main battalion to split it up into as many parts as possible so they could pick
[00:45:37] it apart. Spec 4 jacksmith who is in Charlie company had been a radio operator until about a
[00:45:44] week or so before this operation when he was shifted to a supply clerk's job the events of November
[00:45:50] 17 are etched on his mind. Smith's company commander Captain Fesmire had like the others been
[00:45:58] called to the front by lieutenant Colonel McDade subsequently many people pointed to this as a major
[00:46:05] error and in light of what has happened it was the firing began to roll on all around us the executive
[00:46:13] officer of my company a man called Don Cornette a very fine officer jumped up and in the best
[00:46:18] style of the infantry school yelled follow me elements of our first and second platoons ran right
[00:46:26] towards a series of ant hills within 10 feet of them we saw where the machine gunners behind them
[00:46:31] firing point blank at us man all around me began to fall like moan grass i had never seen
[00:46:40] people killed before they began to drop like flies and die right in front of me these were the only
[00:46:47] friends i had and they were dying all around me
[00:46:54] private first class james h shadden was in forps delta company mortar platoon
[00:47:07] the intensity of the fire increased to the point where shadden couldn't hear anything but weapons firing
[00:47:14] and here's what he says tone johnson came crawling with me hitting the cheek in the back of the
[00:47:18] hand the trees were full of north Vietnamese but spotting one was almost impossible they blended in so
[00:47:24] well i kept raising up to try and detect a good target math you sheltered who is laying next to me
[00:47:30] kept jerky me down as i raised up again a bullet pierced my helmet straight through front to back
[00:47:37] i went down again and came back and as i came back up a bullet struck the tree beside my head from
[00:47:45] behind i don't know if we were surrounded or was our own men they were firing wild anything that moved
[00:47:53] somebody shot at it one trooper crawled up next to me shooting through the grass a few inches off the
[00:48:00] ground toward where our own people lay never thinking what he was doing i told him to be sure he knew
[00:48:05] what he was shooting at the firing eventually began to slack off shadden has no idea how much time
[00:48:14] elapsed there was no way to keep track of time in a fight like this men were wounded and dead all in
[00:48:22] the area six were alive that i know of sergeant Tyler pfc Carter pfc johnson pfc shelton pfc
[00:48:31] cones and myself Tyler gave the only order i heard during the entire fight tried to pull back
[00:48:40] before they finish us off sheldon froze to the ground and would not move the five of us
[00:48:49] proceeded to try and pull back but the snipers were still in the trees soon i was hitting the right
[00:48:54] shoulder which for a time rendered at useless Tyler was hitting the neck about the same time he
[00:49:00] died in arms length for me begging for the medic spec for william pleasant who is already dead
[00:49:07] the last words Tyler ever spoke or i'm dying sergeant Tyler 35 was from Columbia South Carolina
[00:49:24] the helplessness i felt is beyond description within a few minutes i was hit again in the left knee
[00:49:30] the pain was unbearable cones who's hitting the feet and ankle we were wounded and trapped
[00:49:41] i could see we were getting wiped out a buddy helped me bandage my leg he got the bandage off a
[00:49:49] dead Vietnamese i got behind a log and there was a Vietnamese there busted up and dead
[00:49:56] this was behind us so i knew we were surrounded
[00:50:12] it's for me it's crazy to think these are Americans it really is you know it's crazy to thank you
[00:50:19] you always think knifely so that Americans have the upper hand all the time but you know
[00:50:26] here you are you you you you don't you don't always have the upper hand
[00:50:37] if you're chatting continues on it appears as if the ground was opening up and swallowing
[00:50:42] the mortarmen they they felt so fast a brown wave of death rolled over them and on into Charlie
[00:50:49] Company Vietnamese intermixed with them then reality said in the enemy held ground beyond the
[00:50:57] downhill the column was cut in half in coming fire drew our attention back to the tree line
[00:51:04] the firing increased rapidly we returned fire at muscle flashes i heard an explosion behind me
[00:51:10] turning i saw chai congregate's landing all flash and smoke no casualties the volume of fire
[00:51:16] became almost unindurable bullets peeled bark from trees vegetation disintegrated i looked to
[00:51:24] lieutenant James Lawrence for help saw his head violently recoil he hit the ground
[00:51:38] here's another description back to the book here's what the Vietnam War looked like in the
[00:51:42] afternoon of November 17 through the eyes of two of Captain Forrest Alpha Company Rifleman
[00:51:49] PFC David or a perp lavender of Murphy's Burrow Illinois and spec for James Young of steel
[00:51:57] ville Missouri says lavender my platoon was bringing up the rear we started to maneuver and work our
[00:52:04] way up the column to help those ahead every time we made a move we were hit by mortars
[00:52:10] it was something you can't describe people were dropping like flies the first blast killed a young soldier
[00:52:18] named loca telly every time we moved they dropped mortars on us i know we must have had 12
[00:52:24] or 15 wounded out of our platoon including our platoon leader these were my buddies i had been with
[00:52:31] in the army for two years the majority of our whole battalion had been drafted at age 21 and it
[00:52:37] had been the service for over 18 months all of us were nearly 23 years old they became my brothers
[00:52:45] over time hearing these fellow scream hearing them killed stuck in my heart and mind ever since
[00:52:55] the most critical part of this fight was the beginning it was the surprise
[00:53:01] this they had us in a U shaped ambush and they had us cut off with mortars
[00:53:11] surprise and violence of action surprise and violence of action two key elements of fire fights
[00:53:22] and here's what young said the other the other individual introduced a moment ago
[00:53:26] there was a grassy field to my left 25 or 30 yards and a sniper off on my right i couldn't
[00:53:34] see him but i saw a trace of bullet go across my hand i felt the wind of that bullet
[00:53:42] the same bullet passed over the back of Smith's neck he was lucky he had his head down
[00:53:48] our company commander captain force came running along our line he was stopping and telling
[00:53:52] everybody where to go he acted as though he was immune to enemy fire i don't know how he kept from
[00:53:58] getting hit so captain for a stepping up and leading and what's all things do not happen without leadership
[00:54:12] so in less he gets up and makes these things happen they are not going to happen that's what
[00:54:18] you do is a leader you have to make things happen talk about it all the time there's an example of it
[00:54:25] things do not happen unless you make them happen
[00:54:32] now if you remember that oftentimes in Vietnam there would be a command and control helicopter
[00:54:39] and we talked about this on 105 where the brigade commander actually came and landed for a little
[00:54:45] bit and then left well that was Colonel Tim Brown and here we have a little section with talking
[00:54:51] about what's going on with him back to the book Colonel Tim Brown telecopter was running low on fuel
[00:54:56] and the chopper had to return to refuel brown says i knew they weren't a contact i did not know
[00:55:03] house of your or anything else while i was talking to McDade i could hear rifle fire but he didn't
[00:55:10] know what was happening i asked what happened to your lead unit he didn't know where's your trailing units
[00:55:18] he didn't know and he didn't know what happened to any of the rest of them nobody knew what the
[00:55:25] hell was going on we were not in a position to shoot a bunch of artillery or air strikes in there
[00:55:29] because we didn't know where to put them only now that Colonel Brown began rounding up reinforcements
[00:55:36] to send in to help bobbic dates second battalion you notice what he wants to know is where people are
[00:55:49] that that's the you've heard me talk about this before i used to ask the you young junior officer what's
[00:55:53] the most important piece of information you you can have on the battlefield and they tell where the
[00:55:57] enemy is and how how many there are and what kind of weapons there are and no the most important piece of
[00:56:02] information there is on the battlefield is where you are and i actually tell the same thing to businesses
[00:56:06] because sometimes businesses don't know where they are because they're not tracking what they're doing
[00:56:09] so you ask them hey where are you and your in your p and l and your profit lost they don't know
[00:56:14] you ask them where they're doing and there's where their sales performance is they don't know
[00:56:18] well how are we going to make any changes you need to know where you are most important piece of
[00:56:24] information there is here's McDade talking again this is the Colonel or the the the the
[00:56:34] batalion commander lieutenant Colonel in charge on the ground in that first hour or so the situation
[00:56:40] was so fluid that i was acting more as a platoon leader than a batalion commander that's a flag red flag
[00:56:45] right you're acting if you're acting as a battalion leader and you're in charge of so a platoon is
[00:56:49] 40 guys a battalion is 500 600 and he's acting as a platoon leader who's running the battalion
[00:56:58] we were trying to secure a perimeter i was trying to figure out what the hell was going on myself
[00:57:02] i don't think anybody in the battalion could have told you what the situation really was at that time
[00:57:08] i can see where this might have left Tim Brown the brigade commander in the dark about what was
[00:57:13] going on i didn't know myself until things quieted down the battalion commander adds i could have
[00:57:19] yelled and screamed that we were in a death trap and all that crap but i didn't know it was as bad as
[00:57:24] it was i had no way of checking visually or physically by getting out of that perimeter so all i could
[00:57:30] do is hope to get back in touch i wasn't going to scream that the sky was falling
[00:57:35] especially in a situation where nobody could do anything about it anyways
[00:57:46] so if you don't know what's going on that means there's a bad problem that's that's my assessment
[00:57:53] and also it's also if you i'm not trying to say that you should cry wolf because you shouldn't
[00:58:03] but when things are going sideways you can wait for them to develop if you have a grip of what's
[00:58:11] happening if you don't know what's happening you better spin some people up to come help you
[00:58:15] at least get them spinning at least get them turning that happens a lot where the guy on the ground
[00:58:21] might not fully understand what's happening make the call and say hey i need i'm stand by their
[00:58:25] support stand by get qr f spun up you know you make those calls doesn't mean send anybody
[00:58:31] but get them ready get them closer get them on standby qf is quick reaction force so if i'm on
[00:58:36] the ground also getting shot at multiple different directions i'm not really sure what's happening
[00:58:40] i might not say send the qr f but i'll say hey have the qr f move to position alpha
[00:58:46] which is very close to where i am in case i do need them in 15 minutes or a half an hour or an hour or
[00:58:51] right now of at least made that progression that like for just provide some general awareness
[00:58:59] yeah so your qr f quick reaction force they might be they might be 30 minutes away and then it
[00:59:07] might need 15 minutes of notification time yeah so i mean if you call them right now
[00:59:12] they're going to be here in 45 minutes 45 minutes from bad firefight is not going to help you
[00:59:18] yeah so your first call now you might bring them in and you pre-plan this this is when i talk
[00:59:24] about pre-planning we would always pre-plan hey if we need qr f we're going to call you to this point
[00:59:28] here we'll call you to this point here if we need to bring you on standby we'll care call you to
[00:59:32] this point let's say this point is 500 meters away from where we actually are and then we have one
[00:59:36] that's right where we are like you come to this building if we call qr f you come to this building
[00:59:41] we're going to try and get into that building if you don't hear from us and we just call for qr f
[00:59:45] come to that building we'll be inside it the best of our ability as they get closer hopefully
[00:59:50] you can establish communications with them directly but if you start losing control of the situation
[00:59:55] this is the thing when you start losing control of the situation you call up the qr f and say
[01:00:01] hey move to the staging point so now they're moving you start at that 45 minute clock right
[01:00:07] now they've all spun up they're all getting their vehicles they're woken up the people that need to
[01:00:11] get out they get their vehicles and they drive so now they might get to the 500 meters away
[01:00:17] and i had the situation under control and i say hey we don't know you'd you come in we're okay
[01:00:21] pulled off in what you got their bummed but they don't care they'd rather have that
[01:00:26] because maybe in 30 minutes things have developed to a point where i need them and now they can
[01:00:30] get there in 15 minutes instead of in 45 yeah okay so again we're not trying to spin up and
[01:00:36] waste assets but and and actually know who did this a very similar in the in the previous podcast
[01:00:42] the guy that called broken arrow which means troops are about to be overrun he didn't wait for anyone
[01:00:45] tell me he just called it he's okay broken arrow now it takes some time for those guys to show up
[01:00:49] there by the time they got there they needed them similar thing now yeah don't advocate yelling or
[01:01:01] screaming sometimes you might have to though you know you might need to get that information people
[01:01:06] are paying attention what you're saying it didn't be impactful if you've ever been sitting in
[01:01:09] it's in attack corporations and we hear people yelling it gets attention because most
[01:01:14] military guys don't yell in scream for no reason they're yelling in screaming because there's
[01:01:17] there's a reason why they're yelling in screaming don't recommend it i don't recommend it but
[01:01:27] i've heard it you know i prefer the calm guys if you got a yelling scream then calm down and
[01:01:33] talk about what you actually need you can't just continue yelling scream because you'll
[01:01:37] you won't get through clear communication you'll come off his office too emotional
[01:01:43] and you know you just become hard to understand what you're screaming yelling calm down
[01:01:48] get their attention give simple clear concise direction of what you want back to the book each
[01:01:54] and every man still alive on that field american and north Vietnamese was fighting for his life
[01:01:59] in the tall grass it was nearly impossible for the soldiers of either side to identify
[01:02:03] front or fro except it extremely close range americans in all of drab and north Vietnamese and
[01:02:10] mustard brown were fighting and dying side by side it may have begun as a meeting engagement a
[01:02:18] hasty ambush a surprise attacked a battle of maneuver and in fact it was all those things but
[01:02:24] within minutes the result was a wild melee a shootout with just gun fighters killing not only
[01:02:30] the enemy not only the enemy but sometimes their friends just a few feet away there would be no
[01:02:38] cheap victory here this day for either side there would be no victory at all just a horrible
[01:02:44] certainty of death in the tall grass unbelievable horrible
[01:02:57] horrible back to the book just for the headquarter section of the column Charlie company was beginning to die
[01:03:06] Charlie company talking about Charlie company a whole company of men 150 guys
[01:03:10] spec for jacksmith was with the lead elements in the Charlie company formation
[01:03:18] nearly tenet dawn cornet the acting company commander when the company charged into the
[01:03:22] teeth of the enemy machine guns in the first seconds smith saw one of the radio operators
[01:03:26] fall dead with a bullet through his chest his eyes and tongue bulging out
[01:03:32] the men of Charlie company were firing in all directions smith recalls within a span of perhaps
[01:03:37] 20 minutes everyone around me was dead or wounded except me you have to understand that an
[01:03:45] area the elephant grass was chest high once you hit the dirt your world was about as big as a
[01:03:51] dining room table your world's completely confined to that area and the six or seven men around you
[01:04:00] at that point we were isolated
[01:04:02] alpha company was in the same shape then the north Vietnamese swept through I believe they
[01:04:08] came between alpha and our company began to shoot people we didn't know if the noise was
[01:04:13] from five feet away as they began to shoot people was friendly or enemy
[01:04:22] smith saw soldiers take machine guns lie flat on the ground and begin firing into the grass
[01:04:27] often they were firing right into the muscles of other American machine guns people were
[01:04:33] screaming to stop the shooting it began to have all the elements of a massacre
[01:04:39] nobody was in control because all the officers were to the front and our radio operators had fallen dead
[01:04:46] on their radio sets no leadership no communication you know I talked to businesses that I
[01:04:56] explained this to my there's your point yeah it is loud and clear tell these businesses
[01:05:01] were like going talk to businesses they talk about this problem and that problem the other problem
[01:05:04] the problem is leadership that's the problem is the problem is leadership
[01:05:11] and the situation like this where the leaders are not there to lead you've got serious problems
[01:05:16] on your hands especially once again if you haven't trained people to lead to step up and lead
[01:05:22] when the leader's gone if you haven't trained people to do that you're gonna have problems no one is
[01:05:27] going to lead
[01:05:36] back to the book pain fought the north Vietnamese had done a much much better job of anticipating
[01:05:43] and preparing for the attack but the Americans who survived the initial onslaught began to rally
[01:05:48] in one respect you could think of it as little big horn we were surrounded with our
[01:05:53] packs in front of us shooting it out during the course of that long afternoon I never saw
[01:05:59] soldier not do his duty I never saw anyone who cowered in the face of the enemy our backs were
[01:06:07] against the wall and it was a matter of survival every person I saw rose to the occasion so this is
[01:06:13] the American troopers are doing what American troopers do fight even in these terrible
[01:06:22] situation no one cowers no one stands down back to the book shortly after word the command came
[01:06:30] over the batangin net throw smoke lieutenant Gwen moved a little way into the grass and the
[01:06:36] men in Albany perimeter all began to throw smoke grenades I saw skip fuzzmire Charlie company commander
[01:06:43] throwing smoke I had no idea what the hell he was doing up here our perimeter was marked with colors
[01:06:49] with all colors of smoke delineating our positions and shortly after the air strikes started
[01:06:57] they were the they were eight one east sky raiders with napom the first napom canisters fell
[01:07:04] right at the point where sajini's and i had left the jungle and came into the clearing
[01:07:09] we could see masses of north Vietnamese on the other side I was sure I was very sure they were
[01:07:14] going to come across at us I think they were cleaning up over there shooting down at the ground
[01:07:19] dispatching our wounded that first strike was right on target with two napom cans I saw them hit
[01:07:26] the tops of the trees and jelly napom was coming down through the limbs and the NVA were jumping
[01:07:31] trying to get away and being engulfed in flames I saw that time and time again lieutenant Gwen
[01:07:40] remembers it cleaned out swath after swath those fuckers would jump up and try to run they didn't
[01:07:47] make it by now the Americans were cheering and laughing at each strike the cheering stop when they
[01:07:53] dropped two canisters directly onto the position where the remnants of the second platoon had been
[01:07:57] making their stand it might have been me but all I could hear was the cracking of unexpected
[01:08:03] rounds burning in the flames that engulfed our men none of us know if there were any alive at the time
[01:08:13] but none of us wanted to think about it
[01:08:30] spec for dick acumen of the recompletun remembers our artillery was supporting us so close that we
[01:08:36] would occasionally get some shrapnel there were planes flying close air support we started digging in
[01:08:42] everywhere we could my entrenching tool was attached to my pack left out in the clearing so I used my
[01:08:47] band at my fingers and someone else is too old when it was available the comfort of a trench just
[01:08:53] big enough to hold your body is unbelievable no more than 200 yards away in that tortured column
[01:09:01] of desperate Americans one man prayed for a miracle and the US Air Force delivered it
[01:09:06] pfc Jim shaden delta company who had booby trapped his own body with a hand grenade was badly wounded
[01:09:15] an unable unable to move he was directly in the path of a group of north Vietnamese soldiers
[01:09:21] methodically sweeping the ground killing his wounded buddies then here's what he says
[01:09:28] before the north Vietnamese got to me half a dozen of them a pilot came over at treetop level
[01:09:34] level turned straight up and dropped the canister of napalm dead center on them
[01:09:40] i never cease to be a mage amazed at the accuracy of that drop the heat of the napalm rolled across
[01:09:47] my face and body like an open door on a furnace i owe this pilot more than it is possibly possible
[01:09:56] for a human to pay may god bless all pilots now we hear from captain abuse tally's
[01:10:11] bravo company first battalion fifth cavalry was a was assigned the mission of attacking
[01:10:17] to relieve the pressure and attempt to link up with the beleaguered battalion
[01:10:21] refreend forcements were also on the way for the battalion command perimeter at the head of the
[01:10:27] column during the afternoon captain miranda dyrics battle weary veterans of the fight at
[01:10:34] landing zone x-ray bravo company second battalion seventh cab got a warning to prepare for a
[01:10:40] night aerosol into a hot landing zone the bravo company troopers delighted to have survived the
[01:10:48] hellish fighting on x-ray and enjoying a well deserved rest and a lot of cold beer back at camp
[01:10:53] hollow a were stunned when they were told they were being thrown back into a desperate situation
[01:11:00] so suddenly so if you remember did gyric from podcast 105 from 270's bravo company 27 they
[01:11:07] went in and helped turn the situation around at lz x-ray they fought hard and then they got extracted
[01:11:16] and now they're getting told there's a bad situation going on again and we need to put you back
[01:11:21] on back and back on the fight back to the book specialist john willenus bravo company mortar observer
[01:11:33] was doing some serious celebrating he had not only survived x-ray without a scratch but this day
[01:11:38] November 18 was his birthday I was 22 years old we were fed and showered new clothes were available
[01:11:47] I spent the afternoon at the men's at the enlisted men's club drinking beer with a
[01:11:51] well tuned exchanging stories and celebrating my birthday around 4 p.m. to dyric came in and told us to
[01:11:59] saddle up we were going to rescue the battalion out about 1600 hours lieutenant Rick rest score
[01:12:08] a recalls captain dyric walked up get the company together battalion's catching health we
[01:12:15] may have to go in you're the only patoon leader left in the company help all the patoons get their
[01:12:20] shit together men spilled out of the clubs and doubled time to their equipment they worked
[01:12:27] quickly throwing on their harnesses no protests but their eyes filled with disbelief again
[01:12:33] dyric then issued the the shortest frag order in bravo company history will be landing
[01:12:40] from the southeast open fired anything on your left run to your right a hostile landing
[01:12:46] with one side of the landing zone held by the north Vietnamese sit rep from the ground grim
[01:12:53] expect to be sandwiched between friendly and enemy fires
[01:12:56] at about 545 p.m. rest scorela gathered the patoons they pressed in close listening
[01:13:06] intently for word sergeant first class oldston oldston the mortar patoon sergeant
[01:13:16] sergeant staff sergeant martin speck for Vincent specialist walinas the towering
[01:13:24] sergeant Larry Milton 80 or more young faces hollow eyes you know the patangin is in the
[01:13:34] shit I said we have been selected to jump into that shit and pull them out if you fight like you
[01:13:40] did at x-ray you'll come through it stay together come out of those choppers ready to get it on
[01:13:46] across the field the first lift ships were sweeping in head him up captain direct grout
[01:13:54] I turned and walked ahead fantino trailing with the PRC 25 the road stretched out past the
[01:14:01] permanent hooches of the rear echelon at hallaway word spread that we were on a suicide fight
[01:14:08] tumbling out of cozy bunks hallways finest line the road to watch us depart Hawaiian shirts,
[01:14:17] aviator shades jeans, beer cans and hands cooks and bottle washers the shit burgers,
[01:14:24] projectionists club runners same army different species the company picked up pace a tight
[01:14:34] dirty brown column a few of the men carried eight k's trophies from x-ray no one had shaved noted
[01:14:43] risk orla but our weapon sparkled one out fit are you one spectator asked the hard core of
[01:14:50] bravo company second of the seventh where you headed to kick ass a yelled back a deep rumble ran
[01:14:58] through the ranks men yelling cursing not a man among us with swap places with these
[01:15:04] lardasses as we passed I asked fantino how we looking back there his reply no straggler sir
[01:15:13] every swing and dick is with us as we made a column right to the pickup point I looked back at our crew
[01:15:20] no outfit in the army had ever rendered a route step any better than these men at this moment
[01:15:28] we piled on to the huge without the usual loading instructions and skated away into the fading gray light
[01:15:36] at 645 p.m. the first lift ships roared into the small Albany clearing and captain to
[01:15:43] direct troopers bailed out into the tall grass the cavalry had ridden to the rescue but the killing
[01:15:51] and dying and terror continued unbated inside the american perimeter as the long night began
[01:16:02] once again that's the american soldier right there barely survived x-ray get called to go back in
[01:16:09] and they pick up the pace back to the book captain to direct road of the flight in in the situation
[01:16:21] on the ground assaulting Albany we picked up five bullet holes in the helicopter things were bad
[01:16:26] I found out what I landed that the battalion was shot up pretty bad so we came in the nica time
[01:16:32] to their rescue the main part of second battalion seventh calves was on their last ditch standard Albany
[01:16:38] little big horn revisited and here's rescor la talking looking sideways I saw trickle of blood
[01:16:47] down the pilot sleeve this is as they're flying in the choppers drop the few feet the pilot
[01:16:53] yelled at the gunner the gunner snalled get out I hesitated get the fuck out four of us dropped the
[01:16:58] bone-jarring ten feet now inside the battalion command group perimeter rescor la took stock
[01:17:06] here's what he says the battalion sergeant major sat against the tree with a bandits chest we got hit
[01:17:12] bad sir real bad the wounded were gathered thirty yards from the CP only half my platoon
[01:17:18] hit arrived the other ships turned back because the ground fire in darkness the perimeter was an
[01:17:24] oval island of trees three platoons could man the perimeter but with the exception of our people
[01:17:30] and pat pains recomplatoon there was no unit cohesion Colonel McDades slumped against the tree
[01:17:37] he looked exhausted he was exceptionally silent major frank Henry has executive officer was
[01:17:42] reassuring the active a short fire plug of a man Henry waved a welcome working the radios
[01:17:49] captain Jill Price the fire support coordinated coordinator crouch beside him
[01:17:54] clumps of survivors sprawled inside the perimeter including several company commanders
[01:18:02] lieutenant Larry go in watched the reinforcements arrive I saw Rick rescor la
[01:18:06] comes swaggering into our lines with a smile on his face an m seventy nine on his shoulder
[01:18:12] and his m sixteen in one hand saying good good good I hope they hit us with everything they've got
[01:18:18] tonight will wipe them up his spirit was catching the troops were cheering his each load came in
[01:18:26] and we really raised a racket the enemy must have fought that an entire battalion was coming
[01:18:31] to help because of all our screaming and yelling major Henry directed that I round up some men
[01:18:40] and police all the ammo resupply which the choppers brought in on the last flight it was lying
[01:18:46] and crates on the far side of the lz somehow we got it all into the perimeter as I came back with
[01:18:51] the last load I passed right over the body of that northeastern east side killed early in the flight
[01:18:57] there wasn't much of them left and I didn't give a damn so I mean there you go there you see one
[01:19:08] one leader makes a difference one leader makes a difference here these guys are completely surrounded
[01:19:14] dead and wounded everywhere and Rick Resscorla comes in and says good I hope they bring it tonight
[01:19:20] will wipe them out back to the book lieutenant pat pain of the recompleton was just as happy
[01:19:27] about the reinforcements as Quinn we were all very surprised to see those helicopters come in
[01:19:33] we were only securing one side of the lz so when the guys would jump off the helicopter we
[01:19:38] halted them which way to come I had a feeling we had actually been rescued that in the fact that
[01:19:43] the cavalry had arrived just like in the movies I admired the courage it took to land in all the
[01:19:49] knee lieutenant Resscorla was one of the best combat leaders I ever saw during two tours in Vietnam
[01:19:55] he walked around and pepped everyone up by telling them they'd done a good job that there was
[01:20:00] support now that things were under control he never raised his voice almost spoken of whisper
[01:20:06] we were awfully glad to see him and the others from bravo company we got in there until
[01:20:15] every hour you did a good job didn't get all negative although he's actually and he talks about it
[01:20:22] I think I think I'm going to cover it but he talks about what he was actually thinking was like
[01:20:26] this is going to be really problematic in his mind he was thinking this is bad really bad but he didn't
[01:20:32] show that he showed hey we're good bring it you're you're good now good job get ready to get it on
[01:20:43] talking a little bit about the the air support that they're getting back to the book chief worn
[01:20:49] officer Hank Ainsworth had been overhead in the second baton command chopper all day and here's what
[01:20:54] he says I was overhead when the fight started and orbited overhead to late that night I was on a
[01:21:00] freak talking to a major frank Henry later that evening he called me Henry said we have critically
[01:21:07] wounded down here if we don't get them out they're going to die I called met a back and they came out
[01:21:12] made a pass drew fire and refused to land to land Frank Henry knew exactly what to do about
[01:21:19] that situation he told Hank Ainsworth to call the 229th Huey slicks the old reliables
[01:21:26] Ainsworth notified the 229th pilots told them that L's Y Albany was hot but that second baton
[01:21:33] seventh cavalry had critically wounded men who would die if they were not evacuated
[01:21:39] says Ainsworth the whole damn unit volunteered I told them we only needed two ships
[01:21:46] despite Ainsworth's call for only two ships four Huey slicks lifted off from camp all the way
[01:21:52] Turkey farm at 950pm for the 40 minute flight to Albany Captain Bob Stinette was again in the
[01:21:57] lead followed by a Captain Bruce Thomas chief one officer Ken Faba and war officer Robert Mason
[01:22:06] and here's what Stinette says normally the Huey pilots thought I'll back their engine
[01:22:10] as soon as they touched down to conserve you will fuel not tonight something told me not to do that
[01:22:18] to keep the engine turning at a full flight to RPMs they told us the wounded were ambulatory
[01:22:24] when we got in there they were all stretcher cases my crew chief and gunner had to get out and
[01:22:28] raise the seats so we could get all the stretchers in then all hell broke loose fire was coming
[01:22:34] in from everywhere I immediately pitched I immediately pulled pitched and with the RPMs at flight
[01:22:39] the ship instantly jumped 30 feet in the air and kept going up we went so fast that the crew
[01:22:45] chief and gunner got left behind on the ground and I didn't even know it we just flat left them
[01:22:50] we had the wounded inside when we got back we counted 30 holes in my machine that was enough
[01:22:56] for me and my Huey the lift of three that went in after dawn after me took in medical stuff
[01:23:03] and brought back more wounded and my crew major Frank Henry was on the flashlight at the time
[01:23:09] Joel Sajini's watched it with all the brave aviators wrist everything for the wounded at all
[01:23:17] the knee I remember thinking they were the bravest pilots I had ever seen they were sitting ducks
[01:23:22] and I fully expected to see them shot down at any moment they were guided in by Frank Henry
[01:23:28] you could see the tracers the aircraft didn't hesitate it a bit they landed loaded and were gone
[01:23:34] in seconds so again you see what that's the American flighting spirit oh we got a hot LZ
[01:23:42] where we're probably gonna get shot down but we've got wounded Americans on the ground we're going
[01:23:46] to get them everyone in the unit volunteers we only need two aircraft guess what we're bringing for
[01:23:52] back to the book after midnight several shots rang out from inside the perimeter a
[01:24:03] trooper 20 yards behind risk gorilla inside the perimeter had rattled off a panicky three rounds
[01:24:09] risk gorilla walked back and cost out the group in the middle of perimeter if I hear one more
[01:24:14] round out of you we'll turn our weapons around and open up no one fires from inside the perimeter
[01:24:19] if you want to fire out to the perimeter if you want to fire get out to the perimeter line
[01:24:25] whispered communication took place all night between isolated elements outside the perimeter
[01:24:29] if there was heroism it was out there in the tiny groups of wounded and those who had
[01:24:34] bandaged and protected them through the night they were just like hunting buddies said risk gorilla
[01:24:40] surviving by instinct looking out for each other lieutenant Larry going a valve company recalls
[01:24:46] that late that night one of Alpha's missing men crawled into the American perimeter here's what he
[01:24:51] says sergeant James a malarty from our first platoon made it back to our lines his story the
[01:24:58] NVA had been shooting our wounded one came up to him stuck a pistol in his mouth and fired
[01:25:05] the bullet exited through the back of his throat knocked him out and they left him for dead
[01:25:09] he survived and when he woke up that night he started crawling to us
[01:25:20] the next day was a real nightmare as we went out to find our dead in missing
[01:25:26] I think each of us cracked up a little bit that day as the true picture of the action began to unfold
[01:25:32] then it came across the radio Bravo company had found another survivor from our second platoon
[01:25:38] he had been badly wounded in the legs and it prop himself up against a tree he had been
[01:25:44] burned by napalm waiting in the night and some north Vietnamese had put a pistol to his eye and pulled the
[01:25:49] trigger shot him in the eye blinded him but he was still alive I saw him being brought in by
[01:25:59] stretcher smoking a cigarette all fucked up so at this point things had backed off a little bit they
[01:26:08] backed off and they actually did the madmen it which is something that Hacworth talks about
[01:26:14] and it's something that they did in the first part of this book which is hey everyone in the
[01:26:20] perimeter is just going to shoot a bunch of rounds like at 630 in the morning boom everyone fire a
[01:26:26] full load out or a full magazine or a couple magazines at likely targets and they did that and
[01:26:35] that seemed to calm things down they kind of did that once things had already calm down a little bit
[01:26:41] and it was it was it indicated that maybe things were calming down a little here's another thing
[01:26:49] back to the book the NBA came into the ambush area that night to recover their dead wounded
[01:26:53] when they found any of our guys alive they would beat them to death bayonet them or machete
[01:26:59] them to avoid shooting and drawing fire from us that was during the night they did that like I
[01:27:07] said they did the madmen and here's what here's what Lieutenant Riscordla said about the madmen
[01:27:12] and he said this decision was regrettable rifle fire shattered the silence and the perimeter
[01:27:17] was wring with reckless firing little fought had been given to that the remainder of our survivors
[01:27:23] were sprawled among the trees and ant hills within 500 yards the effective range of RM16s what the
[01:27:29] fuck is happening are you shooting at us the frantic radio call started coming in how many troops were
[01:27:36] killed or injured by our wake up call will never be known thank God for the trees the ant hills
[01:27:42] and the uneven terrain captain Dudley to Demy third brigade fire support coordinator remembers flying
[01:27:52] out to Albany at first light the next morning Tim Brown myself Mickey Parrish took a while to get through
[01:27:59] the smoke hanging over the whole area not much had really taken place in terms of policing the area
[01:28:05] the image is still vivid in my mind is the carnage folks were still sitting around in a days
[01:28:12] they hadn't done much had even taken ponchos and covered up these bodies I could handle the
[01:28:19] conversation I could handle grown men crying but we were talking 12 hours later sitting there
[01:28:26] feeling sorry for themselves Colonel Brown was very pissed off even if you do get caught in a bad
[01:28:32] situation you have to do something to recover it was young kids who paid the price in later years
[01:28:40] I used to stress that to my young battery commanders it isn't us who die in combat it's those young
[01:28:45] kids who die those kids we are responsible for training and leading it's our job to get the job done
[01:28:52] and get those kids home safe and here they're wrapping up this again now this the battle turned and
[01:29:09] really the Vietnamese left after the massive air strikes it started and here's another image of the
[01:29:20] cleanup back to the book specialist for John Molinas of Bravo Company second battalion seventh
[01:29:27] cavalry mortapal tune and most of the rest of Djeric's men were involved in this macabre depressing
[01:29:34] duty it was incredible carnage we went into areas where lots of artillery had come in during the night
[01:29:42] and we saw our guys have been blown up in the trees the bodies were already decomposed and it only
[01:29:48] happened night before we were in shock it was the first last and only time I ever saw anything like it
[01:29:57] and I pray never again the stench was unbelievable we started hauling in the whole body's first
[01:30:07] then we brought in the pieces and parts two chinooks came in and we loaded one with about 20 corpses
[01:30:16] neatly arranged in lids the pilot began preparing to take off one of our officers pointed
[01:30:23] M16 at the pilot told him to keep the board on the ground we weren't through bodies were loaded
[01:30:30] floor to ceiling when the ramp finally closed blood poured through the hinges I felt sorry for the
[01:30:40] poor bastards who would have to unload this chopper back at Holloway the nightmares
[01:30:49] born of this battle have never faded the final division headquarters account
[01:31:09] reported that the two seven alpha and bravo companies and the one five battalion suffered
[01:31:19] 151 men killed an action 121 wounded and four missing in action and on April 6th 1966 so
[01:31:33] quite some months later how more who was at that time had become the third brigade commander
[01:31:41] went back to lz all been he and recovered the bodies of all four members of two seven who were
[01:31:49] brought back on a hero and began the long journey home to America
[01:31:55] now this was as I said kind of the the tipping point in the Vietnam war and this
[01:32:11] battle had a impact strategically one thing that came from this battle and I'll talk about a
[01:32:19] little bit more in the book but the body count came back and the body count came back
[01:32:24] basically as 10 to one maybe 12 to one so for every 10 or 12 north Vietnamese soldier that was dead
[01:32:33] there was only one American killed and our generals liked that ratio they thought hey you know
[01:32:42] we we can win a war of attrition and one of the comments that comes in in the book
[01:32:52] as they go back and an interview general jayap who's the the senior general of the north
[01:32:59] Vietnamese army he's got a book actually we're going to do in the podcast at some point
[01:33:04] he's the mastermind of a strategy and he said we thought that the Americans must have a strategy
[01:33:12] we did we had the strategy of a people's war no part of what that means is that
[01:33:20] the strategy of the people's war means we're going to suffer some casualties and we're okay with that
[01:33:27] so our strategy of saying well we'll get them into a war of attrition they're okay with it they don't care
[01:33:33] human life has less human human life has less value for them at this time they the commander
[01:33:39] sure's held in care you know we talked about that last time they're losing guys on the from malaria on the
[01:33:44] trail you're going to lose five sick guys they don't care they've got a war to win so talking
[01:33:53] about some of the other sort of strategic things or strategic implications from this
[01:34:06] night nineteen sixty seven so this is a couple years later back to the book in mid-december
[01:34:11] president Johnson convened a white house meeting of his top advisors will bungee says that
[01:34:16] McNamara's option number one get the hell out of Vietnam now while the getting is good was never
[01:34:21] seriously considered nor was it pressed by McNamara option number two the huge build of
[01:34:29] of the American combat and support troops was readily approved by all including McNamara
[01:34:34] ever the numbers cruncher McNamara told the gathering the military solution to the problem is not
[01:34:42] certain the odds of success are one out of three or one out of two
[01:34:49] McNamara did push for a bombing post prepare US opinion public opinion for the coming escalation so
[01:34:56] again well I'm sure at some point in this podcast we will dive deep into the
[01:35:04] political manipulation the political decision making that happened during the Vietnam War but
[01:35:10] this is this is what they're talking about it's interesting here McNamara even back in 1967
[01:35:17] to say in how we got like a one in three maybe one in two odds of winning
[01:35:21] this is not this is not this is not good odds we don't like those odds
[01:35:33] here's here's how more talking again back to the book in late June 1966 my turn was
[01:35:39] up as commander of the third brigade when my replacement a Colonel straight out of the pentagon
[01:35:44] showed up to take over my brigade was in the field fighting near Dong Tre it would have been
[01:35:49] criminal and those circumstances to relinquish my command to a two man who's still
[01:35:54] still pissing state side water and I flatly refused to do so the change of command was delayed
[01:36:00] ten days until the fight was over a month later on August 8th 1966 my replacement sent my
[01:36:06] replacement sent alpha company first battalion seventh cavalry back in the hydrying valley by itself
[01:36:12] and twenty five men were killed in one terrible day so not a good turn over situation
[01:36:20] again this is where this is where the beer you people always talk about when I talk with businesses
[01:36:24] they go we have a big bureaucracy here and you don't understand like no we understand the military
[01:36:28] understands peroxie better than anybody we probably got the biggest and most most firm
[01:36:35] in place bureaucracy in the world and this is part of it right here back to the book I
[01:36:42] hope that my next assignment would be to the infantry school at fort bending where I could pass
[01:36:46] along what I had learned in Vietnam for the young officers who are headed for combat it was not to be
[01:36:51] in fact only one of the hundreds of officers who had gone through air mobile training and a year
[01:36:56] in the field with the first cavalry division was assigned to the infantry school I was sent
[01:37:02] instead to Washington DC where I was told my next job would be Latin American desk at the U.S. State
[01:37:08] Department this is this is an embarrassment right here's this guy basically created or helped
[01:37:15] create or helped test the the idea of air mobile helicopter assaults and then he did it for a year
[01:37:23] in the field commanded at the battalion and that the brigade level and instead of putting him in
[01:37:29] the infantry school or he could teach the stuff that he learned they send him to be the the
[01:37:34] Latin American desk and I'll tell you what's awesome this was awesome when I was in the
[01:37:40] sealed teams I went to Romadi when I came home guess where I went I took over the west coast
[01:37:45] seal training for the for the guys that were getting ready to deploy right out of the casing
[01:37:49] I did what he wanted to do which is perfect and luckily we have the little a little less bureaucracy
[01:37:55] and I was able to talk to my boss and say hey this is what I should be doing see yeah you're right
[01:38:01] and put me in that position but it didn't happen and here's all this knowledge going and they said
[01:38:06] only one officer out of a hundred that's another thing like when you hear you know people on the
[01:38:16] business well they say what the military is this great organization the military has all kinds of
[01:38:20] problems military is no perfect no perfect example of the way to run things parts of it are
[01:38:28] but you can't look at the military to hold and say that that even remotely makes sense in any
[01:38:32] way shape or form and I could point a thousand things out to you today the military is the same way
[01:38:35] doing dumb stuff I mean it's a great organization there's got great people there's there's
[01:38:41] unbelievable leaders in there but there's also idiots the military is made up of people of human beings
[01:38:52] brilliant ones dumb ones back to the book for the next year I watched Bob McNamara
[01:39:03] and John McNott and both brilliant man go through hell as they struggled un-successfully to get
[01:39:08] a handle on the war and the pacification progress and Vietnam at the end of that year neither of them
[01:39:15] was either neither of them was any closer to finding or creating such a handle an office wit
[01:39:23] summed up what was happening in Vietnam sadly and succinct although we have redouble our efforts
[01:39:31] we have lost sight of our objective so we're pouring all these troops in there
[01:39:39] pouring all this money in there put all this all these assets in there we've we've redoubled our
[01:39:44] efforts but we've lost sight of our objective back to the book what then had we learned with our
[01:39:53] sacrifices in the hydrating valley we had learned something about fighting the north Vietnamese
[01:39:58] regulars and something important about ourselves we could stand against the finest light infantry
[01:40:04] troops in the world and hold our ground general west moreland thought he had found the answer
[01:40:11] to the question of how to win this war he would train one American life for 10 or 11 or 12
[01:40:19] north Vietnamese lives day after day until Ho Chi Minh cried uncle west moreland would learn to late
[01:40:31] that he was wrong that the American people didn't see a kill ratio of 10 to one or even
[01:40:38] 20 to one as any kind of bargain but we had validated both the principle and the practice of air
[01:40:47] mobile warfare a million American soldiers would ride to battle in Huey helicopters for the next
[01:40:54] eight years and the familiar whoop whoop of their rotors would be the enduring soundtrack of this war
[01:41:04] finally even though it took 10 years cost the lives of 58,000 young Americans and
[01:41:12] afflicted humiliating defeat on a nation that had never before lost a war some of us learned
[01:41:18] that cause vets had it right 150 years earlier when he wrote these words no one starts a war
[01:41:30] or rather no one in his senses ought to do so without first being clear in his mind what he
[01:41:38] intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it
[01:41:43] class with
[01:41:58] be clear in your mind in what you intend to achieve
[01:42:08] no what you are going to do that doesn't seem like too much to ask certainly in war
[01:42:25] and you wouldn't think it would be too much for people to ask in their lives either
[01:42:31] their precious lives as precious as these 58,000 that died in Vietnam heroes
[01:42:48] but how often do we see people going through their lives without knowing what they are trying
[01:42:54] to do without having any intent without having a clear mission I'm talking on an individual level
[01:43:03] as a person people go through their lives without knowing what it is they want to do
[01:43:13] what they want to accomplish
[01:43:14] so no what your mission is no what you're intent as the commander of your life
[01:43:32] no what your intent is and then fight with everything you've got to win
[01:43:50] and I think that's all I've got for tonight so
[01:43:54] echo maybe if you want to shed some light on how people can
[01:44:04] maybe help themselves when that war and maybe support the podcast if they want to
[01:44:11] they want to that point though in my opinion is it good it's a good one it's a good one
[01:44:20] I think about people go through their lives and they're trying to do yeah and it sounds the same thing
[01:44:25] is going to war without knowing what they are coming supposed to be
[01:44:28] yeah you go but it sounds kind of like obvious when you say it you know like hey go through
[01:44:39] when you go through life should you have a goal real obvious yes you're not going to say no you
[01:44:44] shouldn't have a goal kind of thing so it seems obvious but you know how you live day to day
[01:44:49] you you know you might have a goal for the day maybe two maybe three but Brad life is four
[01:44:54] life is a full spectrum stuff well again it's so shocking because what you're saying is
[01:45:00] absolutely true you wouldn't think that people would be going through life without knowing
[01:45:04] where they're trying to get to yeah but you wouldn't think that a nation would go to war
[01:45:09] without clear intention of where they want to end up and how they're going to get there at
[01:45:14] least an idea how you're going to get there now I have a little bit of like when claustrophic says
[01:45:18] how you're going to conduct the war that's not necessarily true because you don't know you can't
[01:45:23] know how you're going to conduct a war before the war starts you can have an idea but you can't
[01:45:27] know fully just like if you were to say hey my goal is to ex in my life you don't know how you're
[01:45:32] going to be able to do that yeah because you're going to you're going to make it adaptation things
[01:45:37] are going to come up things are going to change the battlefield changes your life changes things
[01:45:41] pop up I mean things happen so I think that that idea that you're going to know how you're
[01:45:46] going to execute something is is far fetched I think you what actually I should use the word idea
[01:45:53] you should have an idea of how you're going to do it yeah you should have an idea like okay well this
[01:45:56] is what I need to get done this is what I want to achieve in my life I want to make I want to do this
[01:46:03] what's a simple one I want to own a house that's a simple one that's a good place to start
[01:46:09] I want to own a house okay well let's think about how we're going to get there you know that's
[01:46:14] let's let's think about how we're going to get there you have to build your credit you have to
[01:46:19] you have to borrow money some people something they go to buy a house they've never borrowed money before
[01:46:22] you can't borrow money if you've never borrowed money you can't borrow money for a house if you've
[01:46:25] never borrowed money for a car or a or some smaller object before so you got to establish your credit
[01:46:30] then you got to have two years worth of income then you got to have a big fat down payment sitting
[01:46:34] ready so there's things you got to do this thing now now that might change a long way the idea is
[01:46:39] that you got to move towards that goal but that's what was so nice about hearing the V in the
[01:46:43] Mese commanders intent get close split them up boom you go make that happen hey guess what you want
[01:46:49] to buy a house one day save money have good credit yeah okay well you got to make money how you
[01:46:54] make money you might make it drive an Uber you might make it deliver in pizza you might make it you got
[01:47:00] your real job but that's important your family but then you need a little extra to throw in there
[01:47:03] that's why you end up driving Uber you end up with whatever you're going to do you want to make
[01:47:06] your you're some money on the side that you can start stashing away yeah and at the end of the day you
[01:47:13] do have that goal you know so it is yeah how you conduct yourself it's not going to be cut in
[01:47:20] drive for sure but you know in these examples like you know you want a buy house that's a goal
[01:47:25] that's just physical but that's just one teeny tiny goal in life if you're on of course you're
[01:47:29] not going to run into somebody who they're only goal in life is to buy a house no no no it's
[01:47:33] I said it's a one yeah it's like a don't buy house it's stupid you should rent things that's fine
[01:47:39] yeah I'm not telling everyone what they're going to should be and if you want to keep renting
[01:47:42] keep renting maybe that's for you yeah yeah yeah yeah not for me yeah but maybe it's for you there's
[01:47:47] other things you want to put your money that's cool you're doing some other something else smart with
[01:47:51] your money yeah like buying rooms or something like that either way though if you
[01:47:57] uh consider like just what went um closet closet it tell you see what what he's saying
[01:48:04] and compared to life right where buying house sure that's one of many goals you're going to
[01:48:08] have in life because life is full like was it but so it kind of when you really think about it
[01:48:14] but it's hard it's hard to like designate some specific goals and then that's all you're going to
[01:48:19] okay let's say you're going to say you're going to be financially secure and independent okay that
[01:48:25] would be a much bigger boss right that's an awesome goal to have and of younger you make that
[01:48:29] goal but better chance you have a achieving it yeah because now you're not wasting your money you're
[01:48:32] actually saving for a house so you can get that house paid off so now you don't have a mortgage anyway
[01:48:35] you know he's like yeah that's a bigger goal that's a broader goal just like when you when you
[01:48:38] go to war you need to know what it is you're going to war for what are you going to do and when you
[01:48:42] going to stop and what's your intended result yeah so you got it in a way you got to fill your life
[01:48:49] with a bunch of goals so you don't get jam because like you have small goals that lead to the
[01:48:56] big goal right so for instance you want to be financially secure and stable what are you going to do
[01:49:02] you're going to save some of your money okay that's one thing you're going to buy a house that's
[01:49:05] another thing you're going to pay off your car and you're not going to buy expensive dumb car
[01:49:09] you're going to buy cheap cars until you have the money to buy them with cash you're going to
[01:49:14] make all these little things you're going to work extra you're going to you're going to do these
[01:49:16] things so you're right you have you have your broad goal yes you have your long-term goal yes and
[01:49:21] then you got your short-term goals that lead and are strategically aligned with that long-term goal
[01:49:25] it's the same thing in war you have to have those both those things going on yeah yeah and then on top of
[01:49:31] that you should have you want to have the last word did it don't you know no no no no I'm making this
[01:49:39] every time I can slightly close out what you're trying to say you you add because it's not that I mean
[01:49:45] it is that but then you're talking about life now and here you're just kind of the point where you
[01:49:49] say okay you say one example is financial like you want to buy house you want to be financially
[01:49:57] least secure that's one goal but in life there's more life than just financial so you want your
[01:50:01] health you want your you know relationships you want your like there's all these things that
[01:50:06] you you kind of hope or want to be solid yeah we'll say so but most people don't really put it in
[01:50:16] perspective that clearly like okay I want you know I'm going to write this down one this so we're saying
[01:50:20] those in the goals if you have goals yes if you have goals in those areas then you can you know you can
[01:50:27] you can you can you can you can avoid a maneuver toward some exactly right avoid distractions all this
[01:50:31] front and fight and fight towards those goals sounds obvious but that's what I'm saying it's like hard
[01:50:38] to like designate each goal in life oh I didn't say this was going to be easy yeah that's
[01:50:45] but it's not that hard if you sat down for 20 minutes I bet you could come up with some solid life
[01:50:49] goal that's kind of the that's kind of the point I was making where it's too busy cruising
[01:50:53] you know and being really it's about this this being distracted I think that's what it is
[01:51:00] you know and if the clear your goal the more I think control you can have over being distracted or
[01:51:05] not because like if your goal isn't that clear it's almost like it's not going to be clear or it is you
[01:51:11] won't really be clear when you're being distracted or not kind of thing people don't you know I'm
[01:51:17] saying people I mean myself yeah we don't live our lives like just in constant pursuit of all our
[01:51:25] specific goals we it's like a lot of life is minute to minute no no you can have some sections
[01:51:34] that you can carve out so you can live like that but yeah that's not where you want to be how
[01:51:38] you're rolling yeah no it's not how it should be so I'm saying so if you're and you'll notice
[01:51:42] in life I think like any any solid goal that you've achieved you'll notice that that it took
[01:51:48] that clear goal and you just didn't get distracted and you just want for it so it's like you've
[01:51:52] done it for yourself and there's also just like being on the path yeah that's what I get about
[01:51:56] Gjitsu right my goal in Gjitsu is never to get a black belt I never said like I want to be a
[01:52:03] black belt just never I never even fought that yeah I just wanted to get better at this thing
[01:52:08] right okay so you will not take it it was it was it was never you go was never my
[01:52:13] goal was not to get a black belt my goal was to train Gjitsu and get better Gjitsu yeah in their four
[01:52:20] comes my goal was like even finances I wasn't like hey I want to make X amount of money I was like
[01:52:29] I want to be able to do whatever I want to do so let's move in that direction yeah that might not
[01:52:35] even have a financial value like there's some people that do whatever they want to do but they
[01:52:38] have a very low income but they set themselves up in such a way that they're allowed to do what they
[01:52:43] pretty want to do check all right are you done last word not on any way oh yeah support right
[01:52:51] that's what we were talking about all right yeah you can support it when you pursue goals
[01:52:57] you may or may not need support I recommend support supporting yourself support of others from others
[01:53:04] for others to a street kind anyway if one of your goals is to maintain physical shape and
[01:53:12] capability it's important I work out right you work out proud yep all right yeah good so I work
[01:53:21] out right and you know all so my wife will give me grief sometimes because I'll just like work out
[01:53:29] at the wrong time you know because in my mind like working on it's important all right so I can
[01:53:33] like love about you yes I can loosely justify oh yeah you know yeah it's dinner time but hey my health
[01:53:41] right and sometimes it'll still frame it like oh yeah you choose to like work on your work on your
[01:53:47] body or something like that and I say no it's health it's capability it's true but the point there is
[01:53:57] it's important no matter how you frame it or your wife frames it it's important yeah you want to
[01:54:02] do it strategic anyway while doing that you take real oil take stuff that helps maintain the structural

[01:56:17] is it good quality because it's made in America or is it made in America because it's good quality
[01:56:25] well both yeah it's good quality because it's made in America by qualified craftsmen yes i think

[01:58:43] whatever i say do kettlebells and when you do kettlebells get the cool one from on it on it
[01:58:48] on it dot com slash jockel look for the primal bells my opinion actually the zombie ones are pretty
[01:58:53] dope too but get those that's what i think makes it work out more interesting i did one yesterday
[01:58:59] it was interesting kind of hard to but nonetheless yeah get the get them from there i
[01:59:05] they got a lot of cool stuff on there for interesting workouts you want to switch it up

[01:59:14] get some battle ropes go through one of those workouts you didn't want to like that before or
[01:59:19] a battle ropes workout before i have yeah yeah interesting it kind of makes you like serrets kind of
[01:59:26] sore you know what that is you're in your cost almost once yeah i've done there nonetheless
[01:59:32] anyway on it dot com slash jockel that's where you get them solid site also when you are getting
[01:59:39] this book we were soldiers once in young actually i thought it was we were soldiers once in
[01:59:46] young and i was a great no it's we were soldiers once in young and young and by the way we were young
[01:59:53] kind of thing anyway can you get that book good book outstanding book it's a great title when you see
[01:59:58] like my wife will we'll do something that there will be like young seals at yeah and my wife
[02:00:05] so it's like oh thank god so young yeah they look so young you know that's the geoyce thing
[02:00:10] yes i think that these kids are so young and then i i was one of those kids yeah and yeah they
[02:00:16] are young you know that's two fights wars young kids well that's 18 19 20 22 years old 23 years old
[02:00:23] that's who fights wars yeah and it's crazy and jpe kind of talks about this where your maturity kind
[02:00:29] of gets on this like fast track when you jump to the military it doesn't it doesn't in some
[02:00:35] way it doesn't it doesn't because you're also institutionalized oh yes so you don't like when
[02:00:40] you're in the middle that's what hurts some guys when they get out of the military they're like
[02:00:43] wait a second i don't wait what is my paycheck it's well it's come every two weeks now it's not
[02:00:46] there and it's used to it yeah oh you have a mission here's what you're gonna do and that
[02:00:51] when you're in the military you just here's your clothes that you're gonna wear yeah you don't
[02:00:55] mean here's the haircut that you're gonna have you get all the military also and you're like
[02:00:59] you don't have this direction anymore so you do get it matures you in some ways and otherwise
[02:01:05] you get stunted growth that's why you get some guys doing dumb shit we're 30 years old 38 years
[02:01:09] old 42 years old yeah they're doing the midlife crisis thing but when you think when you don't
[02:01:16] maybe it's not even a midlife they're just trying to figure it out because you haven't had right they
[02:01:20] didn't do that like at the time is everyone else but you know how you talk about your wife looks
[02:01:25] at the younger guys or the seals and say well they look so young that's I think that's like
[02:01:32] an indicator that she doesn't feel old you know because you know how like when you're when you
[02:01:37] kind of like I do the same thing when I look at college football when I watch college football because
[02:01:41] I remember when I was playing football it's oh yeah there was like I 26 years old on my team
[02:01:46] 26 we're in the same age as old school yeah it didn't help you kind of going bald and stuff like that
[02:01:52] but nonetheless he's 26 26 is young by the way and depending on how old you are because when you're 16
[02:02:00] you don't think you if I tried to ask my son who's 15 like what what how far away 25 years
[02:02:09] or how long was it until he was 25 like he would understand 10 years he has no
[02:02:14] he would not be able to like cognitively assess what a 25 year old human being is thinking about
[02:02:23] he's 50 no access he's not got it going on yeah but I feel like he would still be able to figure
[02:02:29] out okay 25 you know people when do people die of old age quote unquote would be what 80s
[02:02:35] right typically just you don't win ever so you figure 25
[02:02:40] so what less than a 30 year life 26 less than a third that would be considered old technically
[02:02:48] if if they were to think about I think a 15 year old would grasp that even though 26 year old was old
[02:02:53] he was old yeah I thought so so when I look back and then I don't feel old as old as I am
[02:02:58] I don't feel like old I think back when I was in like college or whatever and I think about
[02:03:03] the number of my current age and I think dang that's that's old that's old or person
[02:03:08] being that older person now I don't feel like how I thought that older person to film right
[02:03:15] and I really think that now it really comes and gets put into perspective when I watch college
[02:03:20] football and I seem to take off their helmet I'm like dang that is a child right there playing
[02:03:24] college football performing out performing like super good but they just look so young I'm just like
[02:03:29] your wife they look so young but it's because I don't feel like an old person that's so that's good
[02:03:36] yeah I guess so because you know if you feel like old person you're like yeah they look
[02:03:40] young because they're young there are young I mean old person there you feel like you should
[02:03:44] be in there too and they're like oh yeah and then you say oh okay he's easy on going to
[02:03:47] old you know one of those things nonetheless back to support when you buy this book
[02:03:56] we were soldiers once and young go to jocopiedcast.com we got a section that all the books

[02:04:22] other shopping carry on good way to support also joc was store and I'm gonna talk about it
[02:04:38] but before I do that I think if you subscribe to the podcast is good way to support so
[02:04:44] I was gonna say subscribe if you haven't already seems obvious but subscribe
[02:04:48] leave a review on iTunes if you subscribe to iTunes if you want to leave a review
[02:04:54] if you're feeling reluctant just get over it leave the review also youtube subscribe
[02:04:59] youtube video version of this podcast also excerpts various types of excerpts you know so you can
[02:05:06] share so you know if you don't want to share the whole two and a half hour podcast with people
[02:05:12] there are excerpts if you wanted to share an individual concept with people they can boom they can
[02:05:18] get that concept and you know share it internalize you know also joc was the store
[02:05:26] it's called joc was store joc was to come sure it's t-shirts, rashbirds, hoodies,
[02:05:34] some patches on there hats on there just it's the stuff I'll say it's cool stuff
[02:05:41] I wouldn't be pushing stuff that anything goes cool and it's joc will prove kind of the pink
[02:05:47] shirt's aren't joc or no but nonetheless if you want to get shirts and stuff that's where it is joc was
[02:05:52] store calm they are good stuff they are good they're not like the cheap ones this is what I'm saying
[02:06:01] so boom you can rest assured but yeah tell much you think if you have one hey people take pictures
[02:06:06] of themselves with the shirt on and they say this is a good shirt and that's good I encourage that
[02:06:12] and if you don't like this shirt let me know too there it is also good way to support yourself
[02:06:22] one of the better ways in my opinion depends on what kind of person you are is psychological warfare
[02:06:27] if you don't know what that is it's an album with tracks with joc on each track telling you
[02:06:34] that in your on your campaign against weakness when you hit those roadblocks that's what it is
[02:06:41] rope that's what they are roadblocks mental fatigue distractions all this stuff these tracks will
[02:06:48] help you through it it's joc of telling you pragmatically given you practical information in advice
[02:06:55] how to get over those roadblocks around those roadblocks or through those roadblocks
[02:07:01] I'll make a psychological warfare track then it's gonna be directed towards you to make you talk
[02:07:08] about this stuff faster okay well here's the thing when I you know I come across this
[02:07:15] smart right yeah see and I'm I feel compelled to share the valuable points that I think
[02:07:23] are valuable that I've used or that I felt with each thing but then I'm like oh wait that'll take
[02:07:30] a long time to explain so sometimes I go with it you don't seem to care sometimes I don't
[02:07:36] but today I'm giving you a downjack no I think it's valuable okay we'll go with that
[02:07:45] now watch how fast I do this yeah but you're not gonna give them the whole thing you know
[02:07:49] like the jockel way to you know you didn't demonstrate not demonstrate explain
[02:07:56] yeah the jockel way to guaranteed to get your deadlift 8000 pounds boom that's it done next
[02:08:01] but there's three books you can get way the warrior kid gets kids on the path boom done
[02:08:07] I should have dropped more about bigger kid that's cool no need I don't know man but I think
[02:08:14] like I read way the warrior kid to my daughter every single night it's one or two chapters not too
[02:08:20] long just one or two chapters so she wants to read the next chapter she wanted she wants me to
[02:08:25] read the next chapter that night I say no tomorrow she's looking forward to it every single night
[02:08:28] it's just the mantra the whole way the warrior kid is just a background to you for life yes
[02:08:35] good thing to know don't be weak like work hard all this stuff it would explain that whole thing
[02:08:42] to me I just say because that's the value that I got
[02:08:45] way the warrior kid if you want a longer explanation you can email echo he'll give it to you
