You would set down, you're going to rig this thing and for anyone that doesn't know you're on your knees, when you're rigging something like that, you're on your knees, and you're, you know, got to use both your hands. So, you know, I had to, you know, let him go to happy hunting ground wherever, you know, and crawl back and later on that day, my self and the other guy were able to come out on strings and then they really hammered a place there. When that kind of stuff was going on, what did you guys, was that, you know, we look back armchair, quarter back and say, oh, you know, what were they thinking, what were you guys thinking? This is the type of person that I'm thinking that you're going to save, you know, someone like Colonel William Reader who, you know, the stories that he told about being captured. And they said, you know, with an impact that hard, you know, you're bound to have some, you know, some bruises and whatever. I mean, however, I mean, people were being killed almost every week, but, you know, in every two or three weeks, we'd have, you know, like a memorial service. And, you know, so, you know, they said, your, your name's really, you know, terminator. so that he doesn't see me, you know, immediately, then, you know, I can probably wound him, dragging back in, and you know, he'll be ours. And, you know, when we got back, they said, you know, I think there's something wrong with you. We know that part of it, but when he takes you back to the moment, but we really don't know if this guy's going to live or not. And, you know, if he's got buddies, you know, you can only reach so far with a knife, but with that car 15, you reach way out there and tap somebody. So you start, you know, talking back and forth, you know, with, they've got a cubby out in the area now. I tried not to put anything, you know, besides, you know, the the med kit, which was pretty flat, the gals pads and things like that. and so I guess today, you know, in this day when I hear people saying, ban cluster bombs, you know, you use cluster bombs. Sometimes sometimes when we would get back, you know, the team member setting, you know, the American member setting around, sometimes we would say, man, did you see what, here what happened? I kind of trip out like when I go home in this in a lot of ways, but in this particular way where you know how like in the movies. And, you know, I knew we were going to get hammered because they were going to open up on us. I don't remember exactly how many I had, you know, maybe 30 years old, but, you know, a little less than I had. And then he said, he sent out another made a. And said, you know, we're on fire going down. I had commanders, you know, starting with Dick Meadows, that started this thing about, you know, you're the most relentless person I've ever seen. And, you know, I had other commanders that, you know, after that, saying the same thing. You know, you know, anger and not making good decisions and being loud and being confrontational. So, you know, how like you, when I forget to take it, like you kind of look at me crazy. And, you know, it's a lot closer than, you know, 3,000 meters. I mean, when you were talking to Tilt, he was saying, you know, in late 69 and going into 70, whole teams are just disappearing. And then you start, you know, putting those, you know, rounds through there as fast as you can. But just how weird this is where let's say you went back in time and visited, you know, tilt or whoever and say, hey, this is what you're going to do. And the next day there was a hatchet force that was there too that had a mission to go, I don't know what their mission was, but they were going somewhere. And you're doing all this just on top of, you know, losing your friend, your brother Dennis Neill, who completely, you know, disappears. And you know, you know, when you're in a, a dang, uh, captain of America outfit, just walking around. Bruce is, you know, close to me, but I know where he is. I mean, could you, you know, I had thought it was going to be three years. Because if this guy is going to start acting like an idiot, this is going to be a real problem. But, you know, the regular troops rarely, you know, fired on that much. And you know, I don't know if you've seen. And, you know, we didn't have, you know, communication back and forth. I know the answer I know I can do more. And then it was, okay, you got eventually, you know, but a time the next mission came around. And once they got out there and said, you know, where the king of the Hill, they were told, okay, come on back down. You know, to process out, they told me, now you're going to be stuck here for a couple of weeks or so before we can get you on a plane home. I mean, you couldn't just walk around through the cities and, you know, particularly after curfews and things like that. So you know, the controversy is is brewing around a lot of things between us and the aviation commander over what's going on. I think what I'm going to do is just crawl out there because they're, I know they're crawling around that. And they just couldn't believe that I actually went on a mission like that and was able to do, you know, what we did. They're going to know we're coming back. This guy might know you're going to and then they can beat me. You know, because it's just going to try to come up on auto. I mean, these guys for just to be thinking with all this enemy fire coming, they're not going anywhere. Just some just some little kind of nice to know information which you had none of your brief was there's good guys down.
