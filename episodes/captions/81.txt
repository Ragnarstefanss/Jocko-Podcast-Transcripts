[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 81.
[00:00:05] With echoed Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:09] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:10] Good evening.
[00:00:11] November 29, 1915.
[00:00:20] It has teamed.
[00:00:22] The trenches are ankle deep.
[00:00:25] Some places calf deep in mud.
[00:00:28] The communications trenches are rushing streams of brown water.
[00:00:35] The manor wet through, but stick the job like Britons.
[00:00:40] And I hope for their sake that the weather lifts with the morning.
[00:00:45] The guns have been strafing today, though up till now we have dodged the show.
[00:00:52] It may be ours again tomorrow though.
[00:00:57] It never knows.
[00:01:02] This is from the diary of Captain Charlie May, the British Army Officer Commander
[00:01:12] of B Company, 22nd Manchester Pals Battalion of the Manchester Regiment who served in World
[00:01:21] War I.
[00:01:25] He was married to Bessie May.
[00:01:28] And they had one daughter who was born July 20th, 1914.
[00:01:36] So she was a little over a year old when this journal was being written from the trenches.
[00:01:49] And it continues December 1, 1915.
[00:01:53] It is exciting work, sniping.
[00:01:56] In fact, one must curb the tendency less that should become a fascination.
[00:02:04] The second in command of the E-lance, the East Landchester Regiment, and myself put in a couple
[00:02:10] hours this morning and had quite a bit of fun warning the baches in their trenches.
[00:02:17] The fellow was walking across the open 2,000 yards off when I spotted him and let go.
[00:02:24] You never saw a chap move quicker in your life.
[00:02:28] He ran for a tree and jumped behind it and I let him have four more there.
[00:02:34] Whether I got him or not, I don't know, but he didn't move for the next half hour.
[00:02:42] I know because I waited so anxiously for him.
[00:02:47] This night, or rather, one 30 this morning, I got outside the barbed wire and got lost.
[00:02:54] Three times I had to fling myself down in the wet grass, bury my nose in it and grovel
[00:03:00] while the machine guns went chattering over me.
[00:03:04] It is remarkable with what speed one learns to adopt the prone position.
[00:03:14] January 13, 1916, I long and long to see you, to class view in my arms and I long with
[00:03:26] all my heart to see my baby.
[00:03:30] How I love her.
[00:03:33] What hopes I have for her what a sweet girl she will make.
[00:03:43] February 25, 1916 woke up this morning to find the snow, pelting down and covering the ground
[00:03:50] fully five inches deep.
[00:03:54] Also, it was freezing hard.
[00:03:56] Cotton, a fellow officer, came into breakfast with us.
[00:04:01] He brought the little Bible which another soldier had taken from the body of a dead German.
[00:04:09] On the fly leaf in a child's hand writing, the word, dad-dad.
[00:04:18] War is very sad.
[00:04:22] Perhaps the man may have done and been something to loath and to test, I do not know.
[00:04:31] All I am conscious of is that somewhere in his fatherland there is a little child who
[00:04:37] called him, dad-dad.
[00:04:45] April 6, 1916, Fritz strafed our new trenches with heavies and searched round the support
[00:04:51] with H.E. Shrapnel and other such obnoxious stuff.
[00:04:58] One shell claimed three NCOs and wounded three men.
[00:05:04] We all feel wild to get at the beast and I hope we may string them up on the wire.
[00:05:12] I saw the killed go down the line.
[00:05:17] It was a pitiful sight.
[00:05:21] Poor boys, shell fire is a horrid thing.
[00:05:26] A lad who was a sergeant of mine was the worst.
[00:05:34] It was very, very sad.
[00:05:41] Do those at home realize how their boys go out for them?
[00:05:49] Never can they do enough for their soldiers?
[00:05:51] Never can they repay the debt they owe?
[00:05:56] Not that the men ask any reward.
[00:06:02] But one day we'll get out of with the bayonet.
[00:06:07] We'll take our price then for Grezzi and all the other hundreds, thousands, Grezzi's
[00:06:13] slain as they were standing at their posts.
[00:06:22] June 17, 1916, I do not want to die.
[00:06:38] The thought that I may never see you or our darling baby again turns my bowels to water.
[00:06:49] My conscience is clear that I have always tried to make life a joy for you.
[00:06:57] But it is the thought that our babe may grow up without my knowing her and without her
[00:07:02] knowing me.
[00:07:06] I pray God I may do my duty for I know whatever that may entail.
[00:07:13] You would not have it otherwise.
[00:07:20] June 23, 1916, everything is speeding up to no end.
[00:07:28] Ammunition by the hundred wagon load is pouring up.
[00:07:31] It should certainly not be for lack of ammunition if we do not make a huge success of the
[00:07:37] venture.
[00:07:40] That one cannot help feeling a little anxious and worried.
[00:07:46] So much depends on this great throw.
[00:07:54] What he's talking about there in this part of the journal, it reflects the build-up for
[00:07:59] the battle of the soul.
[00:08:02] Although Charlie doesn't know exactly when the battle is going to commence, they're
[00:08:09] obviously only distributing that information with people that have the need to know.
[00:08:14] They know that a major attack is forthcoming.
[00:08:20] That's why they've got all that ammunition piled up more than they could ever think
[00:08:24] they could possibly need.
[00:08:29] Back to the journal, June 28, 1916.
[00:08:38] The moment seems very auspicious for us to strike.
[00:08:44] Perhaps we will on Friday.
[00:08:51] July 1, 1916.
[00:08:56] We marched up to the assembly trench last night.
[00:09:00] The most exciting, march imaginable.
[00:09:03] Once all around crashed and roared till some times it was quite impossible to hear oneself
[00:09:08] speak.
[00:09:10] It was however a fine sight and one realized from it what gunpower really means.
[00:09:18] Fritz, of course, strafed back and reply, causing us some un-easiness and a few casualties
[00:09:24] before we even reached the line.
[00:09:27] The night passed noisily and with a few more casualties.
[00:09:32] The hunt puts a barrage on us every now and then and generally claims one or two victims.
[00:09:40] It is a glorious morning.
[00:09:44] We go over in two hours time.
[00:09:47] It seems a long time to wait and I think whatever happens, we shall all feel relieved
[00:09:53] once the line is launched.
[00:09:58] No man's land is a tangled desert.
[00:10:02] Unless one could see it, one cannot imagine what a terrible state of disorder it is in.
[00:10:10] But we do not yet seem to have stopped the machine guns.
[00:10:17] These are popping off all along our parapet as I write.
[00:10:23] I trust they will not claim too many of our lads before the day is over.
[00:10:31] Now I close this old diary down for the next few days since I may not take it into the line.
[00:10:37] I will keep a record of how things go and enter it up later.
[00:10:51] Well, that update never took place.
[00:11:01] Charlie May was wrong about how many British soldiers would be claimed before the day
[00:11:08] was over.
[00:11:09] He didn't think it would claim too many but as you know the first day of the battle to
[00:11:14] have a son July 1 turned out to be the worst day in history for the British Army.
[00:11:24] And they suffered almost 60,000 casualties.
[00:11:31] 60,000 casualties in one day.
[00:11:39] Like I said, those casualties included Charlie May when we were over the top.
[00:11:48] On July 1st under the cover of Allied artillery, he was leading B company.
[00:11:57] And he and his men fought their way across no man's land and just as they reached German
[00:12:01] lines Charlie was hit by shell fire then killed.
[00:12:09] And his diary was found by the man that eventually dragged him back to the trenches.
[00:12:14] Private Arthur Bunting, who mailed the diary to Charlie's wife, mod.
[00:12:37] Now the British have a steeped military history.
[00:12:46] And obviously this is the kingdom that we Americans rebelled against in the Revolutionary
[00:12:52] War and we fought them again in the war of 1812.
[00:12:57] And we actually had a bunch of other little various disputes with them until the late 1800s
[00:13:05] and during something called the Great Reproachment through various forces in the world.
[00:13:12] Our political objectives were aligned and we became the staunchest of allies with Great Britain
[00:13:20] through World War I and World War II in Korea and Vietnam and even up till now and Iraq
[00:13:27] and Afghanistan.
[00:13:31] I've been lucky enough to work alongside Brits on just a couple of occasions while I was
[00:13:38] in the military and there's no doubt that they are just outstanding troops professional
[00:13:48] in everything that they do and they leave that impression on you.
[00:13:54] You can actually feel the pride of their military tradition.
[00:14:04] And tonight I wanted to take a look at a book that is part of that military tradition.
[00:14:15] And the book is called Serve to Lead.
[00:14:24] And I'm going to start with some statements from the introduction to this version of
[00:14:29] the book and the version of the book that I'm reading is the old version.
[00:14:33] I think it's from 1954 or 57 originally written right after World War II and these
[00:14:40] comments here are from a guy named Robin Matthews, a former British Army officer graduate
[00:14:49] of the Royal Military Academy of Sanhurst, that's like the British West Point.
[00:14:55] He went on to command his regiment the Light Dragoons, which included a tour of duty in
[00:14:59] Iraq in 2005.
[00:15:02] He also served with 16 aerosol brigade in Hellman Province in Afghanistan.
[00:15:10] And here's what he has to say about this book.
[00:15:14] Serve to Lead is a remarkable book, produced by the Royal Military Academy Sanhurst after
[00:15:20] the Second World War.
[00:15:23] It is as clear and concise a treatise on leadership as you will find.
[00:15:29] It also provides a fascinating glimpse into what sets the profession of arms apart from
[00:15:34] any other.
[00:15:40] Serve to Lead is a anonymous with Sandhurst, placed on the bed of every officer cadet
[00:15:46] at the beginning of their military training, somewhere between prayer book, which is what
[00:15:52] I thought it was initially and Bible, as it has often been referred, it lays out what
[00:15:58] is expected and what to expect.
[00:16:02] On a quivotally, it establishes selflessness, self-discipline, integrity, and duty as the
[00:16:08] bedrock of leadership.
[00:16:11] Excitingly it speaks of courage and boldness as the essential differentiators upon which
[00:16:16] events turn and to which soldiers and leaders are instinctively drawn.
[00:16:24] There is so much to enjoy and consider on every page, but the most buggiling message of
[00:16:30] the book concerns humility.
[00:16:35] Leadership must be confident, but unless it is matched in equal measure by humility,
[00:16:40] it jars at which point the lead simply fall away.
[00:16:46] If I am to lead you first and foremost, I must be your servant.
[00:16:52] Like any good book, the clue is in the title.
[00:16:55] In this case, simple, seemingly contradictory, but ultimately profound, serve to lead.
[00:17:07] That is the intro to this book.
[00:17:09] Obviously there is a dichotomy of leadership.
[00:17:11] He is already talking about things that we talk about all the time.
[00:17:15] And yes, you have got to be confident, but you have got to be humble.
[00:17:19] The title of the book is a contradiction to use a dichotomy in its own sense, right,
[00:17:23] serve to lead.
[00:17:27] And like I said, this book, they actually have a new one.
[00:17:31] And I have the new one.
[00:17:33] I went with the old one.
[00:17:34] And the reason I went with the old one is a couple things that I am going to point out that
[00:17:38] clearly they have changed their thoughts on.
[00:17:42] And maybe we will end up doing a comparison contrast with the new one.
[00:17:44] There aren't that many differences, but there certainly are some very significant differences
[00:17:49] and we will get to those.
[00:17:53] But this is going to kick off with a piece from the Lord Bishop of Durham.
[00:18:02] It is the fact that some men possess an in-bred superiority which gives them a dominating
[00:18:07] influence over their contemporaries and marks them out unmistakably for leadership.
[00:18:13] This phenomenon is as certain as it is mysterious.
[00:18:17] It is apparent in every association of human beings and every variety of circumstances
[00:18:22] and on every plane of culture.
[00:18:25] In a school among boys, in a college among the students, in a factory, shipyard or mine
[00:18:30] among the workmen, as certainly as in the church and in the nation, there are those who
[00:18:36] with an assured and unquestion title take the leading place and shape the general conduct.
[00:18:44] So there is an opinion in people who ask all the time, our leaders born or made, that
[00:18:48] one right there is, hey, leaders are born.
[00:18:52] And that's, I always say both.
[00:18:56] I always say there's certain leadership qualities that people are born with and some people
[00:19:00] are born with a lot of them.
[00:19:03] Some people are born with a lot of those qualities, some people are born with a lot less,
[00:19:06] some people aren't born with any.
[00:19:08] They're not going to be much of a leader.
[00:19:10] It doesn't matter how much you train them.
[00:19:12] You can get them better, but they're not going to be a great leader.
[00:19:15] And obviously, some leaders don't need much training.
[00:19:20] There's very few of those leaders that just don't, they just get it out of the gate as
[00:19:24] just born that way.
[00:19:26] I think it's a mixture of both.
[00:19:28] And I think you're born with some leadership capability and the more you hone it, the
[00:19:33] more you work on it, the better you're going to be.
[00:19:36] Why would you think, or why do you think that is, because to be a leader like the good
[00:19:42] strong qualities that you got to have,
[00:19:44] they're still contradicted or counterintuitive?
[00:19:47] They're not even counterintuitive, but you can get better at all of them.
[00:19:51] A couple of the one that's, for instance, some people are naturally talented, or some people
[00:19:57] are naturally articulate people.
[00:20:00] So they're able to get their message across in simple clear concise language.
[00:20:05] That's very important.
[00:20:07] Now if you're born with that, you're lucky.
[00:20:09] Good job.
[00:20:10] You're born with that.
[00:20:11] You're born in a particular person.
[00:20:13] If you weren't, guess what?
[00:20:14] You're going to have to work out it.
[00:20:15] You're going to have to read.
[00:20:16] You have to write, you have to listen.
[00:20:17] You're going to have to practice speaking to people.
[00:20:19] And you will get better at it.
[00:20:22] So those, that's your example.
[00:20:23] Some people just have it naturally.
[00:20:26] But even people that have it naturally will get better at it over time.
[00:20:30] I was always pretty comfortable speaking to people.
[00:20:33] But obviously, even when I was in the military, I spoke to people all the time.
[00:20:36] And when I was in a training, training situation as a young and listed seal, I was put up
[00:20:41] in front of the classroom and speak to people.
[00:20:43] I got better at it.
[00:20:44] And then when I became an officer and a leader, now I was briefing people.
[00:20:47] And so I'm doing it even more.
[00:20:49] And then I took over the training for the West Coast seals.
[00:20:52] And now I was briefing people all the time.
[00:20:54] And when I was overseas, I was briefing kernels and generals.
[00:20:57] And OK, you're going to brief a bunch of times.
[00:20:59] You're going to get better at it.
[00:21:01] I was already OK at it, just naturally.
[00:21:04] But I got better at it.
[00:21:05] And I'm still getting better at it today.
[00:21:07] So that's the same with any of these particular talents being able to simplify things,
[00:21:13] being able to detach those are all important leadership qualities.
[00:21:17] You can have a certain level that you're capable at.
[00:21:21] But the more you practice them, the better off you're going to be.
[00:21:24] Yeah.
[00:21:25] Yeah.
[00:21:26] So it's a combination.
[00:21:27] Yeah.
[00:21:28] So how you say like, there's it's pretty rare that you get somebody who's, you know,
[00:21:33] just has all the qualities right out the gate.
[00:21:36] Yeah.
[00:21:37] I can't, I've never met anybody that just just dominates and everything.
[00:21:40] Right.
[00:21:41] Because like, like, detaching, for example, that's not that's kind of counter to the
[00:21:46] your natural way of doing that.
[00:21:47] Yeah, that's true.
[00:21:48] Most people are going to want to get in there.
[00:21:49] Yeah.
[00:21:50] For sure.
[00:21:51] Now, I just thought of this example.
[00:21:53] I've talked about them a little bit on the podcast when we had Tim Ferson,
[00:21:56] Alden Lee Grizzard.
[00:21:57] He was, uh, he was my assistant, Patoon Commander when I was at Sealthine 1.
[00:22:03] And he got murdered.
[00:22:05] It was horrible, tragic situation.
[00:22:07] He was an involvement of murder suicide.
[00:22:10] And, but he, he had a lot of those capabilities.
[00:22:13] He had a lot of, he was, a very articulate.
[00:22:15] He was in quarterback at the Navy football team.
[00:22:18] So we had like a real good presence to him.
[00:22:20] He spoke clearly.
[00:22:22] He was down to earth and yet, you know, very, he could elevate himself very quickly when
[00:22:27] he was talking to the, you know, if you need to do elevate himself, you just had a lot of
[00:22:30] those qualities very naturally.
[00:22:33] And guess what, he was at the Naval Academy.
[00:22:36] He played football.
[00:22:37] He was constantly getting in front of him, you know, getting in the hotel and telling
[00:22:40] guys what was going to happen.
[00:22:41] And you get good at that over time.
[00:22:43] And part of that is, so I don't know how much of it.
[00:22:45] You know, I didn't know him when he was a football player when he was in eighth grade.
[00:22:49] Maybe he was stammering and trying to put his thoughts together.
[00:22:53] But then he trained it over and over and over again.
[00:22:54] And he got better at it.
[00:22:55] And maybe by the time he got to me as a 23 year old Lieutenant J.G.
[00:23:00] He was like, oh, we're going to get in the hotel.
[00:23:05] I'll tell you guys what's going on.
[00:23:07] And so, you know, even though it appeared to me like it was natural, probably wasn't.
[00:23:08] It was probably a training.
[00:23:09] He had some natural capability, but he played football in his whole life.
[00:23:12] And that was that.
[00:23:14] Yeah.
[00:23:15] So in a way, you can kind of, and this may be kind of interchangeable as far as the expression,
[00:23:19] but you know, you say natural capability, it could be that they gain it through learning
[00:23:25] or whatever, just through their environment, you know, like as a kid.
[00:23:28] Yeah, yeah, so playing football and then they'll bring it to the training situation and
[00:23:32] they'll excel.
[00:23:33] Yeah.
[00:23:34] But I think it's got to be a little bit of both, right?
[00:23:37] Yeah.
[00:23:38] And you will get better at it.
[00:23:39] But the more you focus on that particular skill, like some people aren't very comfortable
[00:23:43] talking.
[00:23:44] And you know, even they're not even comfortable talking in a conversation, right?
[00:23:47] Oh, yeah.
[00:23:48] And so if you end up with a kid like that, well, you got to get him out and socialize
[00:23:51] them and get him in front of people talking all the time and that will be good for them.
[00:23:57] If you have someone that's, if you've got a kid or, yeah, if you've got a kid or a young
[00:24:02] leader that doesn't know when to shut up, right?
[00:24:07] How are you going to, because sometimes leaders are like that too.
[00:24:09] They want to hear themselves talk and they just keep talking all the time and guess what?
[00:24:12] The more you talk, the less people listen.
[00:24:13] So if I'm giving orders on every little thing that we've gotten to do in front of us,
[00:24:17] eventually you're not listening to me anymore.
[00:24:19] And when something critical comes up, you're still not listening to me because I've been
[00:24:22] talking for the past six straight months won't shut my pie hole.
[00:24:27] So that's a bad situation.
[00:24:29] So how do we get that person to quiet down?
[00:24:34] It's both.
[00:24:35] Yeah.
[00:24:36] All right.
[00:24:38] So now we're going to hear from a guy named Field Marshall, William Slam.
[00:24:42] I think Bill Slam is what they ended up calling him.
[00:24:44] He was in World War One and World War Two wounded multiple times.
[00:24:51] I think three times led the 14th Army in Burma World War Two and he also fought with the
[00:25:00] Anzac, so the Australian New Zealand Army Corps at Gallipoli.
[00:25:04] So you could say he's got a pretty good view of things.
[00:25:11] So he's this, believe it or not, the first this book kicks off with talking about morale
[00:25:19] and the morale of the troops.
[00:25:21] So here we go back to the book.
[00:25:22] Moral is a state of mind.
[00:25:24] It is that intangible force which will move a whole group of men to give their last
[00:25:29] ounce to achieve something without counting the cost to themselves.
[00:25:36] That makes them feel that they are part of something greater than themselves.
[00:25:43] Now this is interesting.
[00:25:45] So so he's talking about the importance of morale.
[00:25:46] Now going back to the subject we were just talking about back to the book, I learned
[00:25:52] two that one did not need to be an orator to be effective.
[00:25:58] Two things only were necessary.
[00:26:01] First to know what you were talking about and second and most important to believe it yourself.
[00:26:09] So there you go.
[00:26:11] You don't need to be a great orator, but you got to know what you're talking about and you
[00:26:15] got to believe it.
[00:26:18] Those are two really good places to start.
[00:26:23] He continues on talking about Moral.
[00:26:25] He says a most potent factor in spreading this belief in the efficiency of an organization
[00:26:31] is a sense of discipline.
[00:26:33] We tried to make our discipline intelligent, but we were old fashioned army and we insisted
[00:26:39] on outward signs.
[00:26:40] We expected soldiers to salute and officers to salute in return.
[00:26:44] Both in mutual confidence and respect.
[00:26:47] I encouraged all officers to insist whenever possible and there were few places where it
[00:26:51] was not possible on good, turnout and personal cleanliness.
[00:26:57] It takes courage especially for a young officer to check a man met on the road for not properly
[00:27:02] saluting or for slavantly appearance, but every time he does, it adds to his stock of moral
[00:27:08] courage and whatever the soldier may say, he has respect for the officer who does pull him
[00:27:15] up.
[00:27:17] This is an interesting point.
[00:27:19] What we're talking about here is I see Ecos, not wearing his uniform correctly, so I'm
[00:27:23] going to go over and tighten you up.
[00:27:28] That is, you can see where people are probably thinking, yeah, Jack will be over that
[00:27:33] guy.
[00:27:34] Right?
[00:27:35] No, actually wrong.
[00:27:36] And what I'm going to talk about here is I'm going to talk about what I call leadership
[00:27:41] capital.
[00:27:42] You only have so much leadership capital in your bank and you've got to decide what
[00:27:48] as a leader you're going to spend that capital on.
[00:27:52] And if I see you out of uniform or you're looking sloppy, I've got to decide if it's
[00:27:58] worth me investing my leadership capital and going over and telling you that you need to
[00:28:01] tighten it up.
[00:28:02] Go, you need to get that.
[00:28:07] Hey, Sergeant Charles, you need to get your uniform squared away.
[00:28:07] You look like crap.
[00:28:08] You're setting a bad example.
[00:28:09] Is that what I want to invest my leadership capital on?
[00:28:12] Now, can it be sometimes?
[00:28:13] Yes, absolutely.
[00:28:14] And we've talked about the many cases where that occurs.
[00:28:17] You know, when you look at at hack worth, when hack worth showed up the Vietnam as a
[00:28:21] battalion commander, he tightened up their uniform standards immediately.
[00:28:25] He tightened him up immediately.
[00:28:28] He knew he needed to invest that leadership capital.
[00:28:30] He needed to start with the small things.
[00:28:33] But if you're in a dearest in situation and you see somebody that maybe isn't doing
[00:28:40] their, isn't wearing their uniform properly and you decide you're going to go tighten
[00:28:43] them up, I'm not saying it's the wrong answer.
[00:28:47] And as Lave Babin will tell you, it's not what you preach to what you tolerate.
[00:28:50] And so if you tolerate the guys looking like crap, they're just going to continue going
[00:28:53] down that hill of looking like crap.
[00:28:55] Now to me, there's a certain point that I won't let you go past.
[00:29:01] If you're a little out of the, out of the standard, maybe I'm going to let that one slide
[00:29:06] a little bit, right?
[00:29:07] But once you get to a point where you're looking like crap, well, guess what?
[00:29:10] I am absolutely going to tighten you up.
[00:29:13] And I'm going to explain to you why it's important.
[00:29:14] I'm not just going to go and yell at you.
[00:29:17] No, not happening.
[00:29:19] So you've got to be careful how you ration your, your discipline and your leadership capital,
[00:29:26] right?
[00:29:27] If you just run around yelling at everyone or getting an everyone's face for every
[00:29:30] little thing that they're doing pretty soon, you could look at that like well, pretty
[00:29:34] soon, they'll, they'll be scared of making mistake.
[00:29:37] But that's, that's the point.
[00:29:38] Now you got people that are scared of making mistake.
[00:29:40] Yeah.
[00:29:41] Now you're cutting off their ability to, and they're desired to think freely.
[00:29:46] So the bottom line with this balance, you've got to stay balanced in these things and
[00:29:51] don't waste your leadership capital.
[00:29:53] I was talking to a guy there today.
[00:29:54] He was running a off site for his executive team.
[00:30:00] And I talked to him and he said, man, you know what?
[00:30:03] He was just junk.
[00:30:04] And I said, what happened?
[00:30:07] And he showed up the executive off site and he's in the company and he's the guy that's
[00:30:12] running the off site.
[00:30:14] And he gets there and he says, all right, guys, while we're here, no cell phones.
[00:30:18] So everyone put your cell phones away.
[00:30:20] We need to focus the strategic meeting.
[00:30:22] We need to get this done.
[00:30:25] So the guys put their cell phones away.
[00:30:27] And they start the meeting.
[00:30:28] He says, five minutes into the meeting, the CEO breaks out a cell phone, starts looking at
[00:30:34] it.
[00:30:35] A minute after everyone sees that, you've got half the room looking at their cell phones.
[00:30:39] And he went, like, got kind of nuts on them.
[00:30:42] You know, this is man, what's going on?
[00:30:44] And people aren't even paying attention after the first hour.
[00:30:47] He's this, you know, what's going on?
[00:30:49] And I said to him, I said, bro, let's look at what you just, so then he said, then he
[00:30:54] lost them.
[00:30:55] Like the meeting just went downhill.
[00:30:58] And I said to him, let's talk about what you did.
[00:31:01] Because you invested your leadership capital for this important meeting on telling people
[00:31:06] to not use their cell phones.
[00:31:08] Did you tell him why?
[00:31:10] He's like not really.
[00:31:11] Did you explain to them when they would be able to use their cell phones?
[00:31:15] No, I didn't.
[00:31:16] So you just, now this company is a financial company.
[00:31:20] They've got a lot of things going on.
[00:31:22] You can imagine the CEO of a big financial company's got a lot of important calls and emails
[00:31:26] to check and all that.
[00:31:27] And all of a sudden he gets told, no cell phone.
[00:31:29] What is that going to end?
[00:31:30] What important thing is happening at my company today, where I'm not allowed to talk
[00:31:34] on my cell phone and answer emails or look at my emails.
[00:31:38] And I'm the guy.
[00:31:39] So when would I be able to look at you?
[00:31:42] You didn't tell me that.
[00:31:44] So he invested all of his leadership capital to get people to do no cell phones.
[00:31:48] And he spent it.
[00:31:50] And there wasn't any left.
[00:31:52] And so you have to be careful.
[00:31:55] Now you have to approach it the right way.
[00:31:57] First of all, you could say, hey, listen, guys, we're going to power through a solid
[00:32:00] hour right now.
[00:32:02] I'm going to ask you unless it's just critical.
[00:32:05] Keep your cell phones put away and let's power through this.
[00:32:07] Let's get some good conversation going right.
[00:32:09] And in an hour, we're going to take a 20-minute break where you can catch up on, you've got
[00:32:12] to catch up on.
[00:32:14] And then we'll do another hour off that.
[00:32:15] So now people understand what's happening.
[00:32:17] And they understand why.
[00:32:18] And by the way, if everyone's on their cell phones, we're not going to get what we need
[00:32:21] out of this meeting.
[00:32:22] So you've got to explain.
[00:32:23] And you don't want to invest your leadership capital on things that don't matter.
[00:32:26] So if you're the senior guy in a leadership position and you're focused on some little person
[00:32:31] that's out of uniform, and that's what your focus is, that's not a good focus to have.
[00:32:38] You should set the standard and your subordinate leadership all the way down to the front
[00:32:43] where you've got like you and me are peers and I don't let you.
[00:32:48] I'm not waiting for the boss to come by and tighten up uniform.
[00:32:51] I won't let you tighten up.
[00:32:52] I won't let you wear a crappy looking uniform.
[00:32:55] That's what I want.
[00:32:56] I want to have a gang mentality where we're self policing because the minute I'm from
[00:33:01] the top doing that again.
[00:33:02] Does this happen sometimes?
[00:33:03] Yes.
[00:33:04] I'm not setting out a black and white rule here.
[00:33:08] I'm giving the broad guidance that if you're hack worth and you're taking over a battalion
[00:33:13] where people's lives are at risks and you know that they're slack everywhere and they're
[00:33:16] not doing a good job, you've got to go in there and tighten them up and one of the best
[00:33:19] ways to do that is to go in there and start on the small things.
[00:33:23] But if you've got a functioning unit that there's nothing critical happening and you're
[00:33:27] trying to build that team into something that's a winning team and the first thing you
[00:33:33] could do is go in and focus on some of these small things when you haven't really established
[00:33:38] yourself, that could be problematic.
[00:33:42] So think about those things when you're in those positions.
[00:33:45] Alright, going back to the book, I do not say that the men of the 14th Army welcomed
[00:33:54] to difficulties, but they grew to take fierce pride in overcoming them by determination
[00:34:00] and ingenuity.
[00:34:02] From start to finish, they had only two items of equipment that were never in short supply.
[00:34:08] Their brains and their courage.
[00:34:11] They lived up to the unofficial motto, I gave them, God helps those who help themselves.
[00:34:18] And once again, that's the same thing that Colonel Bill Reader said.
[00:34:24] God help yourselves.
[00:34:26] Alright, now we're going to move on to still still talking about morale.
[00:34:29] We're going to talk to over here from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.
[00:34:37] If you don't know who that is, Monti.
[00:34:39] What are you going to do?
[00:34:43] The Anglo-Iris war, the Palestine conflicts that disperse uprisings and World War II.
[00:34:52] He, you know, obviously ran the British 8th Army World War II.
[00:34:57] So once again, we've got a person with some very solid perspective on leadership and
[00:35:03] combat leadership, the quality of morale, back to the book in war, the moral stature of
[00:35:09] some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more closely knit in proportion
[00:35:15] to the discomforts and dangers they are called upon to face.
[00:35:19] Boom.
[00:35:20] So some guys get better.
[00:35:22] Some guys rise to the occasion.
[00:35:23] Back to the book, such men will occasionally perform in battle, remarkable acts of selfless
[00:35:28] courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience.
[00:35:33] The burdens thrust upon them.
[00:35:37] Other men, however, will under the stress of hardships or dangers surrender to fear or
[00:35:43] fatigue and allow their characters to disintegrate.
[00:35:48] This disintegration will usually take the form of elucining of the moral fiber which results
[00:35:54] in timidity of action and slackness and appearance, while those who have gone to seed
[00:36:00] will be dirty and their appearance will be sluggish and will be slobvenly in these
[00:36:09] later cases there has been a general elucing of character due to partial surrender to fear.
[00:36:17] So I totally agree with this.
[00:36:19] You see in combat situations, people either get better or they get worse.
[00:36:28] Some people just kind of cruise, right, stay in that same zone but some people get better
[00:36:32] or they get worse, they rise the occasion or they fall.
[00:36:36] Back to the book, the good soldier, the man with high morale has not surrendered to fear
[00:36:41] and has maintained his personal standards.
[00:36:44] The bad soldier, the man with low morale, has become incapable of independent action and
[00:36:50] has to some extent shed a part of his human individuality.
[00:36:56] That's an interesting statement that the person that's incapable of independent action.
[00:37:04] He said he shed some of his human individuality.
[00:37:10] Back to the book, basic factors of morale, we now must consider the factors.
[00:37:14] What factors constitute morale of the soldier in the heat of battle?
[00:37:19] Certain factors may be described as essential conditions without which high morale cannot
[00:37:24] exist.
[00:37:26] These four basic factors are one leadership, two discipline, three comradeship and four self-respect.
[00:37:38] Fifth factor devotion to cause must exist but need not necessarily influence all the soldiers.
[00:37:46] Finally, there are numerous contributatory factors which are of great importance but are
[00:37:51] not essential conditions.
[00:37:53] Starting with this first one leadership, morale is in the first place based on leadership.
[00:37:59] Good morale is impossible without good leaders.
[00:38:02] Human beings are fundamentally alike in that certain common characteristics apply to all
[00:38:07] men in varying degrees.
[00:38:10] In battle, the most important of these characteristics is fear.
[00:38:15] All men are afraid at one time or another to a greater or lesser extent.
[00:38:20] In moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance.
[00:38:25] They seek for a person to give decisions they look for a leader.
[00:38:34] The leaders power of decision results from his ability to remain calm in the crisis.
[00:38:43] His greatest asset is the ability to act normally in abnormal conditions to continue to think
[00:38:51] rationally when his men have ceased to think to be decisive in action when they are
[00:38:55] paralyzed by fear.
[00:38:58] A little bit of normal face, from Monti, act normally in abnormal conditions, remain calm.
[00:39:09] Back to the book, the object of training must be first to select those who possess them
[00:39:14] within them the potentialities of leadership and secondly to develop these potentialities.
[00:39:20] This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility.
[00:39:23] The leader's character will develop in proportion to the responsibility with which he has been entrusted.
[00:39:29] So there you go, he's saying the same thing that we were talking out earlier.
[00:39:32] You have certain potentials and you've got to develop those and how do you develop them?
[00:39:38] With people, you give people, you want to develop leaders, you give responsibility.
[00:39:41] You don't give them responsibility, that's going to kill them, but you give them responsibility
[00:39:46] that's going to definitely test them.
[00:39:49] And they're going to have to step up to be able to perform.
[00:39:55] Back to the book, the two vital attributes of a leader are A, decision, in action, and
[00:40:01] B calmness in crisis.
[00:40:05] Given these two attributes, he will succeed without them, he will fail.
[00:40:10] Our great problem in pieces to select leaders, it's to select as leaders, men whose brain
[00:40:16] will remain clear when intensely frightened.
[00:40:24] So from Monty, you've got to remain calm.
[00:40:28] Now he's going to talk about discipline.
[00:40:30] The objective discipline is the conquest of fear.
[00:40:34] There are two aspects of fear.
[00:40:36] Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination.
[00:40:40] A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the far side of the road will remind him of his position.
[00:40:46] He'll suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed.
[00:40:50] It is a function of discipline to fortify the minds that it becomes reconciled to unpleasant
[00:40:54] sights and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences.
[00:41:00] Fear can also creep upon a man during periods of monotony on the line.
[00:41:04] At such time, he will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which beset his life.
[00:41:11] Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce the man's hardcore of courage that he
[00:41:16] will become nervous and fearful.
[00:41:19] Discipline strengthens the minds that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of
[00:41:23] fear.
[00:41:24] It teaches men to confine their thought within certain definite limits.
[00:41:30] It instills the habit of self-control.
[00:41:35] That's pretty amazing.
[00:41:36] It's pretty amazing assessment to think that one of the best premier tools to overcome
[00:41:42] fear is discipline.
[00:41:45] Back to the book, discipline implies a conception of duty.
[00:41:52] Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis by the man without a sense of duty.
[00:41:56] Makes sense.
[00:41:57] Now, he's going to talk about comradeship.
[00:41:59] Back to the book, morale cannot be good unless men come to have affection for each other.
[00:42:05] A fellow feeling must grow up which result in a spirit of comradeship.
[00:42:12] And army is made of human beings.
[00:42:15] So that however much a leader may inspire his men, however perfect the discipline the morale
[00:42:20] will be hard and unsympathetic if the warmth of comradeship has not been added.
[00:42:28] Yeah, you've got to be the hardcore disciplinarian but you need the warmth of comradeship.
[00:42:36] Back to the book, war, the hard business is not necessarily a grim one.
[00:42:44] Even must laugh and joke together must enjoy each other's company and must get fun out
[00:42:52] of even life.
[00:42:55] Must get fun out of life even in times of danger.
[00:42:59] So do you want to have a good time?
[00:43:02] Yes, you do.
[00:43:05] And the thing that makes these dangerous times more bearable is when you're having fun during
[00:43:11] them.
[00:43:12] And that's one of the things I don't talk a whole lot about seal training in here on the
[00:43:17] podcast, but one of the things that you do in seal training is you're doing miserable
[00:43:20] things called wet tired and you're having fun the whole time.
[00:43:23] You're learning that, hey, guess what?
[00:43:25] I consider you're in be cold and it's miserable or I can be cold and I can laugh about it.
[00:43:30] And I can make fun of my friend the way he's shivering.
[00:43:33] That's what makes it bearable.
[00:43:36] And the same thing happens when you get overseas.
[00:43:38] When you joke about really dark things, dark sense of humor, that comes out real strong when
[00:43:45] you're overseas.
[00:43:46] And one of my buddies who was super paranoid, I've talked about them on here before the
[00:43:52] guys found a tube that had shipped like maps or something.
[00:43:59] And if you pulled the tube apart real fast, it sounded like a morgue or a morgue.
[00:44:03] Right.
[00:44:04] So they'd get outside his tent and he was super paranoid.
[00:44:06] We spent a little bit of time getting morgered and so he was a little on edge from that.
[00:44:12] So they'd go outside of his tent and you can hear through the tent.
[00:44:15] It's just a little piece of fabric and they'd go outside of his tent and they'd pull
[00:44:17] that thing and it would sound like a morgue through.
[00:44:19] They'd hear you hear you.
[00:44:22] He'd freak you know what the hell are you guys doing?
[00:44:25] No, you know at first you hear him like fall and like sit the ground and then you'd hear
[00:44:29] the giggling of the guys outside and then you'd hear him, costing everyone out.
[00:44:34] But yeah, but it was fun. It was fun. It was fun.
[00:44:37] It was too far.
[00:44:38] A little too far maybe. But everyone's having a good time and even him, you know, we'd
[00:44:41] get done and he would be come outside. You guys are bastards and we'd laugh about it.
[00:44:46] That's the kind of thing where you're, you got to have fun in these tough situations.
[00:44:50] Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:44:52] I think that's probably why you know like nowadays like contemporary companies they
[00:44:58] incorporate like you know, Jade's company, Frank Maldi got fuzball. Yeah, ping pong. I heard massive
[00:45:05] noises the other day. Kind of sounded like a motor fire. It wasn't quite motor fire, but
[00:45:11] there was something I didn't know what it was and they were they were in a nerf gun fire
[00:45:15] fire fire. Yeah. And by the way, it was floppy. No way. They were doing it.
[00:45:20] Yeah, there was no cover to move happening. It was just all every man from self. I was
[00:45:24] disappointed. Yeah. But that's the, but they're like the reason right where it's, I mean,
[00:45:30] these are, I mean, conceptually it's the same thing. Obviously, you know, it's way different.
[00:45:35] No, actually it's way different, but it's not actually not. Right. When we're going through
[00:45:38] tough things in a business and a company have fun with it. And when I work with companies
[00:45:42] that are good, good companies and they're going through something tough, the ones that have
[00:45:47] good morale, the ones that are laughing, they're the ones that do better. Yeah. Who wants to
[00:45:52] go to work? Yeah. If you don't enjoy the people who work with you know, like why would you
[00:45:56] want to do that? You know, one of the, uh, I hate you can call it the worst job, but I was the
[00:46:02] atmosphere right? So every day I'm wearing a uniform, I'm sitting in a desk all day. I did it for
[00:46:07] 13 months. It was just that part of it. It's, you know, even, it's just a miserable job, right?
[00:46:14] Luckily, first of all, the admels are great guy and I had a lot, we know, I joked around all the
[00:46:19] time with him and his executive assistant is a guy that I would literally not, I would go to a
[00:46:27] three weeks at a time and we wouldn't say one serious thing to each other. Just everything would be
[00:46:33] some joke about every, all the misery that we were going through and by misery, I just mean, you know,
[00:46:39] hours worth of meetings and traveling in all the time and being on the road and staying in
[00:46:43] crappy hotels and flights getting, you know, bumped and canceled and being held over and the
[00:46:48] the admels suitcase not showing up somewhere and he's supposed to go on stage. He doesn't have
[00:46:52] a uniform with them and like that's, you know, not fun. I guess what? I had fun the whole time and
[00:46:58] we'd be joking about, you know, I'd say, well, I guess I'm going to get take one again for the team and
[00:47:03] we'd be just laughing. So yeah, even in these situations that aren't fun, have you got to have fun with them
[00:47:09] and that definitely will help out your morale. And if you're in a leadership position and all you do is
[00:47:13] just better, you don't get, get drown in the misery that you're going through every single person
[00:47:19] that's with you is going to be going through the same thing. And so as a leader, you got to,
[00:47:23] once again, going back to the dichotomy leadership, you got to, you got to know when, okay,
[00:47:28] the guys are in too much stress. They're not having fun. I need to have fun. I need to start a
[00:47:32] nerf war in the office here. So guys loosen up and then there's times where, hey,
[00:47:38] guys are having too much fun. We got to tighten them up. Yeah. Yeah. Like, hey, guys, we got this to
[00:47:42] do. And so you got to ride that, that line and balance it out correctly. Yeah. Yeah. It's cool.
[00:47:47] Huh. Like, newer companies, companies, companies, notes are incorporating that element into the actual
[00:47:55] kind of, you know, you're talking about, yes, you're right. And there's companies nowadays that do it too much
[00:48:00] and all the stuff. Yeah. They can't get anything done. Yeah. They're messing around because everyone's playing ping pong.
[00:48:04] Right. Everyone's in the Lego room. Yeah. Because they got rooms now. It's like, oh, you
[00:48:08] know, and they're in think and they'll play with Legos because that relaxes your mind, I guess.
[00:48:12] Not me when I'm around Legos. I think I'm going to step on them. Sorry. Because I got kids.
[00:48:16] I'm stepped on Legos this night, man. So I don't like being around Legos. I got the PTSD from Lego
[00:48:22] stepping when I was, my kids were younger. Lego. You know, because you can't ever get your son enough
[00:48:27] Legos apparently. Correct. Because they just need everything. And when I was a kid, there was not that many
[00:48:32] different types of Legos. You had blocks. Right. Long ones and shorter ones. Right. Nowadays,
[00:48:39] you get Legos, but they have hands and horrors and machine guns and they got cool stuff,
[00:48:44] but they didn't Legos anymore. They're a little toys. But they still come with a little Legos.
[00:48:48] And they still hurt the bottom of their feet. They step on them. They are surprisingly sharp for kids.
[00:48:53] Major choice, you know? Major sharp. All right. Going back to the book, he's the other thing
[00:49:00] he's talking about self-respect. No man can be said to possess high morale if the quality of
[00:49:05] self-respect is lacking. And this is something that Dick Winner has talked about too. That self-respect
[00:49:10] and how that drove him. Soldiers must be encouraged to respect themselves at all times and under
[00:49:15] all condition. Self-respect implies a determination to maintain personal standards of behavior.
[00:49:22] A man who respects himself will allow neither himself to become slavily nor his quarters dirty.
[00:49:28] Even in action, he will take care to see that his personal appearance suffers as little as possible.
[00:49:35] It is the job of the non-commissioned officer to maintain this aspect of discipline.
[00:49:41] It is the function of the officer to encourage and instill self-respect.
[00:49:47] So, interesting. He breaks that down a little bit like I was talking about
[00:49:52] if I'm the senior guy and I'm around yelling at people about how they're looking. That's not good.
[00:49:57] That should be my subordinate leadership should be tightened and that stuff up.
[00:50:07] Okay, here's his conclusion. Again, this is Monty-Talken. In brief,
[00:50:14] high morale has been defined as the quality which makes men endure and show courage in times of fatigue
[00:50:20] and danger. The cultivation of morale depends on the training of leaders and in-cultation of discipline
[00:50:29] the encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self-respect.
[00:50:36] The leaders must have a belief in their cause and they must pay attention to numerous
[00:50:42] contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance.
[00:50:47] We live today in a scientific age but we soldiers have to remember that the raw material in which
[00:50:54] we have to deal is men. Man is still the first weapon of war. His training is the most important
[00:51:03] consideration in fashioning of a fighting army. All modern science is directed towards his assistance
[00:51:11] but on his efforts depends the outcome of the battle. The morale of the soldier is the most important
[00:51:20] single factor in war. There's Monty and that can be said for just about any organization.
[00:51:31] What your organization is made up of is people and you hear that with businesses all the time
[00:51:37] and our people are most important assets. That's generally going to be the case.
[00:51:43] Here's some now we get into the leadership. The actual leadership section. The interesting
[00:51:47] again they start off with morale. That's the first chapter now they move into leadership.
[00:51:52] And you know clearly from what he just said morale is the most important thing in winning
[00:51:56] battle. I don't agree. I think leadership is the most important thing. Now his number one
[00:52:01] is number one factor in good morale is leadership. I guess you know you could see where we're
[00:52:10] coming from a different angle but my thought is a little bit different. My thought is the most important
[00:52:15] thing is leadership and I think that leadership covers other things just be besides the morale
[00:52:20] of the men because now we're talking about the strategy that you're using, the tactics that you're
[00:52:23] using, everything is covered by leadership. Including morale. Yeah so you guys are looking
[00:52:30] in it from not opposite but just varying perspectives where he thinks leadership is part of morale.
[00:52:36] You think I think we're all trying to leadership. Yes. I think you have identified the situation
[00:52:41] correctly. All right here's some more from Monti on leadership. I would define leadership as
[00:52:47] the will to dominate together with the character which inspires confidence.
[00:52:53] All leaders got to learn to dominate the events with surround him. He must never allow these
[00:52:59] events to get the better of him. He must allow nothing to divert him from his aim. He must always
[00:53:06] be on top of his job and be prepared to accept responsibility. So Monti is talking about
[00:53:12] ownership. Now what I have to caveat this with is you get these people at a single-minded
[00:53:21] right and that they're going to dominate everything that's going on around them and they do that
[00:53:25] from a tactical perspective, not from a strategic perspective. So for instance if you say I must never
[00:53:35] or I must dominate the events which surround me and must allow nothing to divert me from my aim.
[00:53:41] That can actually be problematic if it doesn't make strategic sense. Right so if I'm always
[00:53:47] worried about dominating everything that's going on around me and the thing that's going on
[00:53:51] around me isn't really that important. I'm wasting my time on it. So this has to this has to be
[00:53:58] sort of offset a little bit by that dichotomy of leadership which is yes you want to dominate
[00:54:03] what's going on but if what's going on is important you need to let it go. You need to just let it go a
[00:54:09] little bit. All right so now we're going to hear from Jim and by the way this book what this book
[00:54:18] serves to lead it's it's basically a bunch I should have said this in the beginning but it's
[00:54:24] it's a bunch of small excerpts bigger than quotes some of them are just quotes which I don't
[00:54:29] do a bunch of light cages reading quotes I do a couple I'm going to do a couple today but some
[00:54:34] of them are like you know two three four pages of peoples of views on leadership of which I'm
[00:54:39] pulling out some of the highlights and interestingly for the first time I was going through
[00:54:44] some of this and I was like you know what I'm actually it was something that I've said a million
[00:54:49] times and so I said you know what I'm not actually going to highlight this again because I've said
[00:54:58] it over and over again now clearly with discipline I just talked about it for 47 minutes and
[00:55:03] I probably always will when I get the opportunity but there's a lot more about this but there's
[00:55:08] all section on discipline we'll get to all right now we're going to talk we're going to hear from
[00:55:13] General John Hackett again World War II African campaign it's part of Market Garden which is the
[00:55:21] big airborne operation for World War II then here's what he says I am a soldier in speaking of
[00:55:28] leadership I do so as a soldier and when I think about it as any soldier often must I do so in the
[00:55:35] context of battle pressures in battle are high and in battle as a consequence the problems of
[00:55:43] leadership stand out in bold relief and that's something very similar to what I say which is
[00:55:51] combat is like life amplified and intensified wrote that an extreme ownership and that's what I'm
[00:55:56] talking about and because it's that way it's very easy to identify what's going on with the leadership
[00:56:02] it's a very the the the problems of leadership stand out in bold relief he said it better than me
[00:56:08] back to the book but while battle may be unique the problems that it exposes are not
[00:56:15] right yes leadership problems and have been working for
[00:56:19] seven years with other companies and people that are not going to battle and guess what the
[00:56:24] problems that battle exposes are not unique to battle for leadership is concerned with getting people to
[00:56:31] do things and as most keenly needed when difficulties doubts and dangers are at their greatest
[00:56:40] in whatever sphere this is attempted the problems are essentially similar so anytime you got a team
[00:56:45] you got trying to make and do something the problems are pretty much going to be similar
[00:56:51] back to the book I said that leadership was concerned with getting people to do things what I meant
[00:56:57] was getting them to do things willingly so we don't want to just park orders of people that
[00:57:07] doesn't work doesn't work in business doesn't work on the battlefield will it work for five minutes
[00:57:11] yes it will well I can I yell at you and get you to do something yeah sure you're on monster.com
[00:57:17] looking for a new job and you get home back to the book a man really only gets a full response from
[00:57:24] the many leads by something approaching complete fusion of his own identity with the whole that
[00:57:30] he and they together form so think about that if you're in charge of something and you're a leader
[00:57:37] you need to become that thing you need to become that team you need to become that goal
[00:57:43] I like that one and you can see when people get possessed like you look at the modern business leaders
[00:57:47] today those are people that you know Steve Jobs he was the obsessed with the product that he was Apple
[00:57:56] and that's one of those things that was so beneficial. Elon Musk just like he is what he's trying to do
[00:58:08] back to the book successful military leadership is impossible without the leader's total
[00:58:13] engagement in the task in hand and to the group committed to his care for its discharge and what's
[00:58:21] interesting about that was talking to your brother J. Charles of not too long ago actually was
[00:58:26] pretty long going he and he said something to me and it was like a big revelation to him and he was
[00:58:34] very as a very he had a good way of saying what I'm just reading about right now we were talking
[00:58:39] about something he was going to meeting and he was going to be you know talking about something
[00:58:43] there were some controversy about whether we're going to go and and he said that the person that
[00:58:49] cares the most wins and that's a great statement and it's very true it's not 100% true
[00:58:59] put the the the percentage is very high up there because if I just care about something so much
[00:59:06] and I'm going to drive with it further than you if I care about this decision more than you do
[00:59:13] I got a really good chance of winning really good chance of winning yeah kind of seem to like
[00:59:18] that translates into any goal yeah any more you care about it the the more probability yeah I guess
[00:59:25] the only the only place where it becomes problematic is if I care about something you know at 97
[00:59:35] level 97 you care about with the the opposite decision you're also at level 97
[00:59:42] now we got an issue now we got a problem because we're both going to think we're going to win
[00:59:47] and we both believe that we need to win so now we got an ego scenario going on and things become
[00:59:52] problematic and any of the where this just becomes stupid is in the when you hear people having
[00:59:57] political I would use an air quotes on that one political debates around something yeah
[01:00:02] you know this person totally believes 100% and this person totally cares 100% and they're
[01:00:08] going to go nuts on each other and they don't listen to anything that the other person says
[01:00:12] and you end up with a big disaster on your hands of nonsense yeah a lot of those
[01:00:18] what would be political diet that's another one yeah you know I was listening I was listening to
[01:00:25] our podcast and what we're talking about we're talking always talking about watching people in the
[01:00:31] news and that's a classic situation where you know you got somebody on a three minute segment
[01:00:36] and one person is you know the hardcore in this direction the other person is the hard
[01:00:40] corner of the direction they both care they both care a lot neither one of them is going to win
[01:00:46] they actually that that goes the next that's the next realization is that if you're going up
[01:00:53] against person that cares as much as you do you actually have to take a back step and find another
[01:00:59] way you have to flank them because you're not going to be able to win them by going ahead dead they
[01:01:03] care as equal to to you so you've got to find a new solution otherwise you know what you'll do
[01:01:08] expand all your ammunition charging machine gunnests and you'll die yeah that you don't want to do that
[01:01:15] if you care as much as me and I don't have the same opinion I've got to flank you yeah a lot of these
[01:01:20] probably gonna let you think you just want the argument in order to flank you too by the way yeah yeah the
[01:01:25] again political related diet uh how to raise kids you know all these are all yeah when you
[01:01:31] hot button yeah you call it hot things that you're not supposed to talk to or talk about around
[01:01:35] the Thanksgiving dinner yeah they get heated real quick and you and a lot of times we're talking
[01:01:41] about you know people or not people but we talk about how much someone cares about it right
[01:01:45] and then you can a lot of times the things they get mixed up is how much you care about it
[01:01:50] versus how much you care about your stance on it yeah so there's some different but it's a different
[01:01:56] and wrap everything you got to put your ego into both those right that's the ego I don't want to admit that
[01:02:00] I'm wrong right that's what I do that that means you care about your stance so when you make about
[01:02:05] yourself them but if you care about the issue like if I said if I mean you were having a debate about
[01:02:11] kettlebell workouts or something and I like dumbbells you like kettlebell but I really care about
[01:02:16] the issue and the issue is what's the best exercises if I truly care about what the best exercise is
[01:02:22] and not about my stance on what to pick I'm gonna care about the real answer rather whether it's my
[01:02:28] answer or not so that's why I think like political all these other things they they have that and it is
[01:02:32] it's just like I said it's the ego natural thing but they wind up caring more about their stance on it
[01:02:39] then they do the actual issues you know for sure don't let that happen I'm going to let you
[01:02:44] know for that one so yeah the 90's said not 90's but the the person who cares the most wins
[01:02:49] doesn't apply to someone's individual stance on something it applies to you subject and it also
[01:02:57] doesn't apply to you know a G.J.2 match because I'm not really care about winning your thing
[01:03:01] about this the other day because that's another thing people say mental oh it's all mental and here's
[01:03:05] an example Alex Arnold who's a rock climber who just climbed L. Capitan in Yosemite which is 3000
[01:03:12] feet tall and if you will say oh it's all mental and and people say things you know if you want something
[01:03:21] bad enough you do it you put me on that rock there's a some crox move like 2000 feet up 2000 feet
[01:03:29] up that's really hard and you're smearing which is this technique and rock climbing where
[01:03:33] you don't and I've done it before and I'm like the lowest white belt I'm not even a white belt
[01:03:38] like like someone gave me my white belt and rock climbing I'm not like a legit but I know I've tried
[01:03:44] things I go to Yosemite and I'll play around on the rocks and everything but I've tried this thing
[01:03:49] it's called smearing and and you're basically just using the tread or just the bottom of your rock
[01:03:54] climbing shoes on flat granite and you can create enough friction that you can you can move up it
[01:04:02] and some people are really good at it I suck and you know you got to you got your hand hold
[01:04:08] your work and you're using your feet and it's really weird balance that you have to do because
[01:04:14] if you push too hard in the rocks you're feet slip off and if you don't push hard enough you don't
[01:04:20] get any lift so it's this really fine like balance you've got to have and apparently there's
[01:04:27] one move or this one series of moves on this climb that he did that you have to smear and of course
[01:04:34] this is very natural for him but apparently he climbed that section with a rope like six or seven times
[01:04:40] just to make sure it felt good and all that stuff here's my point even if it wasn't smearing
[01:04:45] part even if it was just holding on to rocks right at 2000 feet I would absolutely want really
[01:04:52] really badly to hold onto the rocks I don't have the muscular strength to do it I mean the
[01:04:58] things that he's holding onto are smaller than with the first pad of your fingers that's what
[01:05:04] he's holding onto the tiny and we were doing this the other day at my house remember that little
[01:05:10] thing you actually had bed had stronger grip than me on the on the climbing board that I have at my
[01:05:15] house but I could I could couldn't even hold on or I could hold on for five seconds and you like
[01:05:21] had no it did you hold onto the really small one yeah that's legit I can't even hold onto that thing
[01:05:26] so if I was 2000 feet up and I really really really really really really wanted to do it and I was
[01:05:32] all mentally in the game guess what I'm falling to my death because I don't have the strength to
[01:05:38] do it I don't have the physical strength and I need to build it and okay you could say and that
[01:05:43] that's might be an acceptance okay if you really have the mental strength and will to do it then
[01:05:48] you'll train train super hard but at that moment not gonna help me I'm falling to my death
[01:05:54] right yeah I think that's not a metaphor but like it's like it's a romantic thing yeah yeah
[01:06:03] you want it bad enough you can do it no actually not true I want to take the extreme version
[01:06:10] I want to stay alive I'm 2000 feet up I want really badly to stay alive it doesn't matter
[01:06:15] I can't get across that section I can't don't have the hand strength to do it not happening
[01:06:19] but they're making a movie about that I can't wait to see it about Alex Honoled climbing that rock
[01:06:25] Jimmy Chen is the famous kind of photographer guy that they went and documented the whole thing
[01:06:30] and apparently one of the articles said that during that crux moments Alex Honoled was like hey
[01:06:36] when we get to here just like back off with the cameras he apparently was like you know just back
[01:06:42] off the cameras when I go through you know section 94 alpha because I think he thought he didn't
[01:06:49] need any cameras around real close when he might fall to his death it's bad heavy yeah like
[01:06:57] or is it because it might break his concentration or both I don't know I don't know but that's
[01:07:03] crazy yeah have you ever been to your somebody no it's it's L capitan is 3000 feet straight up
[01:07:12] of granted it takes people three four five days to climb up it he climbed it in three hours and
[01:07:18] forty five minutes with a chalk bag and a pair of shoes it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
[01:07:25] yeah it's completely ridiculous 3000 feet that's very tall echo you're trying to imagine it let me
[01:07:32] help me no I mean taller than anything you've ever seen it's taller than a skyscraper and
[01:07:37] right it's it's huge and he climbed it with no ropes that means there's no rest that means there's
[01:07:44] no break yeah and it means there's no mistakes you can't make a mistake if you make a mistake you die
[01:07:51] crazy very impressive I don't even know why we're talking about Alex Honoled right now
[01:07:56] oh because we're talking about mental will yeah whoever believes it the most yeah whoever believes
[01:08:02] the most wins oh cares about it sorry not believes yeah it's much as I care about staying alive
[01:08:07] I wouldn't be able to pull it off yeah I think in Jade's situation that it did make sense though
[01:08:12] you know because you're you know no I actually say it does make sense yeah it does make sense and that's
[01:08:18] why I was able to do a lot of stuff that I've been able to do in my career right when I was in the
[01:08:22] military a lot of the stuff that I was able to get done I was able to get done because I cared about
[01:08:28] it more than the reals okay yeah like you think you're gonna you know you think you're gonna
[01:08:34] outperform my task unit I care about this so much I don't care I care about this so much you're
[01:08:42] not gonna be able to compete with me yeah because you might think oh I'll get there at five
[01:08:45] a clock in the morning I've been there for an hour you might think I'm gonna have my guys drill this
[01:08:49] ten times I'm gonna have my guys drill it twenty times I care about this too much for you to win
[01:08:53] you can't beat me you can't beat me it's not gonna happen I care about this too much
[01:08:57] non-to-bad way non-to-selfish way I care about this I love this this is everything to me you know
[01:09:03] you have other things going on and you got your wife and you got your family and you got this other
[01:09:07] thing going on in your life and you got goals that you want I don't care about any of those things
[01:09:11] this is all I care about so therefore you can't compete with me and that's pretty cool it's a
[01:09:16] cool place to be and get overseas people are thinking about all these other things no you don't
[01:09:21] care about anything I don't care about anything else this is the only thing I care about
[01:09:24] hmm so it ends up getting boiled down to just not stopping right not not quitting not giving
[01:09:31] up yeah that definitely plays a role that definitely plays a role and of course there's got to
[01:09:37] be balance because if let's say I don't care about let's say you know my my focuses 100% my
[01:09:43] seal task unit but then I forget about the fact that we're working with other army units
[01:09:49] right not only think I care about as my unit well no actually I need to care about the mission
[01:09:52] more right any care about our strategic where we're going strategically because otherwise I'm
[01:09:56] thinking I just want to get my guys taken care if I just want to get my guys more work I just want to
[01:10:01] get no actually I do what care what Trump's my care for the task unit was care for the mission
[01:10:07] of what we're trying to accomplish now luckily those two things are completely aligned so there was
[01:10:11] never any time where I was thinking oh should I do this to benefit the task unit or benefit the mission
[01:10:15] no no if it benefit the mission it benefit the task unit if it benefit the task unit benefit the
[01:10:19] mission period so I care about those things be here now a hard time compete with me and luckily
[01:10:25] in Ramadi there wasn't any competition we were all working together that's what's so amazing about it
[01:10:30] yeah was army marine corps us everyone was just working together to accomplish missions because
[01:10:37] that's what you get when you get a nasty battlefield you get people working together all right
[01:10:47] another piece this is a guy named general Montsell war is preeminently the art of the man
[01:10:57] who dares to take the risk of the man who thinks deeply and clearly of the man who when accident
[01:11:05] intervenes is not thereby cast down but changes his plans and disposition with the readiness of
[01:11:13] a resolute and reflective mind which so far as is possible has for scene and provided against
[01:11:20] difficulties there you go that's what we're talking about oh accident intervenes cool good
[01:11:27] I'm not cast down change plans adapt back to the book no now no man can inspire confidence in others
[01:11:37] who is not confident in himself and self confidence comes from knowledge a thorough understanding of
[01:11:43] modern weapons and organization tactics and the details of administration affecting all those
[01:11:49] under his command must therefore be acquired by every leader he must show his troops that he can
[01:11:54] plan soundly lead resolute and deal promptly and effectively with the unexpected in addition to gain
[01:12:01] full confidence of his troops a leader must have their personal friendship and trust
[01:12:10] I like that again I've there was a there was a seal off so that once was briefing guys and
[01:12:16] said if you guys if you guys if you if your people like you they then they uh
[01:12:22] you're not doing a good job in not true he's actually saying they need your trust and
[01:12:29] personal friendship and trust yeah once you say something like that that even that you can't push
[01:12:35] that too far well of course yeah you've got a balance that you're not in the leadership you can't be
[01:12:40] such close friends that you're choosing that you're putting one person as more important than the
[01:12:47] mission or the team that's the dichotomy leadership okay now he puts together this
[01:12:57] list which yeah we're we're feeling pretty good about this one a short list to leadership given
[01:13:03] as follows perfect your military knowledge study the use of weapons their tactical handing
[01:13:09] the enemy's character and methods and way to make use of ground so I don't care what job you're
[01:13:14] in apply those right know your tools know the enemy know your competitor next study the man
[01:13:22] on your command know them well and be known to them gain their confidence by your knowledge
[01:13:28] energy and skill and by your interest in their welfare always be cheerful with them however you may
[01:13:35] feel teach yourself to think out reasoned appreciations leading to clever but uncomplicated plans
[01:13:42] quickly and unheardly so there you go keep things simple know your people get the I like
[01:13:50] to know your people get them to know you too yeah that's important next study methods of deception
[01:13:57] and make full use of them always aim misleading the enemy always seek surprise keep your object
[01:14:04] clearly before you concentrate your efforts and resources at the decisive point always think well ahead
[01:14:14] prioritize next cue work out the best methods of control in different tactical situations
[01:14:21] practice them constantly study the situation carefully don't waste any time make up your mind and
[01:14:28] stick to it get out your orders quickly make certain that everyone clearly knows what you intend
[01:14:34] to be done commander's intent maintain the initiative make opportunities and seize them at once I
[01:14:43] like that make opportunities why do I like that don't wait for them to come be prepared to take
[01:14:51] risks but don't be foolhardy know your commander's intention and act in accordance with it don't
[01:14:59] wait for orders in action is always wrong so there you go this is just reiterating things that
[01:15:08] I talk about all the time never take counsel of your fears think of the enemies difficulties and how
[01:15:15] you can take advantage of them remember that it is will power that wins oh he's he's going
[01:15:21] off and we're not talking about carry it's not about will which will goes a long way never relax your
[01:15:29] efforts until victory is one attend to the comfort of the troops before you think of your own
[01:15:36] this is all just phenomenal stuff be loyal to your superiors and your subordinates express your
[01:15:44] views clearly and frankly but when a decision has been reached fully supported and stop all criticism
[01:15:53] never take shelter behind others when things for which you are responsible have gone wrong
[01:16:01] take some ownership oh I like this one refrain from jealousy resentment and self-seeking
[01:16:09] be tactful never make friction be thoughtful and consider it but maintain firm discipline
[01:16:20] think about how bad this thing about the dichotomy of that be thoughtful and consider it
[01:16:23] but maintain firm discipline never order troops to do what you are not prepared to do yourself
[01:16:32] never give an unnecessary order that's a good one think about that one never give an unnecessary
[01:16:43] order and I'll tell you why I like that one is because if you're doing a good job as a leader
[01:16:50] orders should barely even be necessary they should barely even be necessary I talked about this
[01:16:57] with life the other day I mean I'm sure we could go back through you know the history of
[01:17:04] tasking of bruiser but as we we were having a conversation we were working with a company
[01:17:09] I don't think I ever gave an order to either one of my two Patoon commanders either life or
[01:17:17] the Delta Patoon commander I don't think I ever said this is what you're going to do that's an order
[01:17:22] like you see in the movies right I'm sure it's been said to me before more like an
[01:17:36] admit like not a administrative situation I don't know if anyone's ever said it to me before
[01:17:41] like that's an order I don't know if I'm trying to think of there's been some situation where
[01:17:45] someone said to me like hey basically like you've pushed far enough jocco stand down
[01:17:50] like I got one of those before like hey we get it jocco you care about this a lot it's not happening
[01:17:56] stand down I've got some I especially got those little younger like when I was a young and
[01:18:02] listed guy the driving with an idea I just be wanting to crush it and and people would be kind of
[01:18:07] saying hey well know we can't well and I be like no why can't why can't we why why why why won't
[01:18:12] we do this we need to do this this is the smart thing to do you know so I think to do and I
[01:18:16] would just eventually get like the little hey stand down we're not doing it okay you know what I'm
[01:18:22] gonna do become an officer I want to listen to you anymore so yeah I've got I think I've got a
[01:18:29] couple stand downs in my time stand down that's an order yeah that's an order that when you
[01:18:34] think about or anyway when I think but it's it really does seem like a movie line yeah and one thing
[01:18:39] is that means that you have not done a good job as a leader if I have to say that's an order
[01:18:43] that means I haven't done a good job as a leader that means you don't understand the mission you
[01:18:47] don't understand the intent you don't understand I haven't conveyed it to you properly and the
[01:18:52] only way I can get you to listen is by saying that's an order yeah pulling rank yeah pulling rank
[01:18:56] on you that's not a good not a good situation back to the book never overlook failure to carry one
[01:19:05] out so it's never given unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out some people have
[01:19:14] to chime in with their opinions on that one never overlook failure to carry one out
[01:19:23] I'm not sure on that one what does that mean to carry one out that's what I'm saying I don't know
[01:19:27] it says it says never order troops to do what you're not prepared to do yourself never given
[01:19:32] unnecessary order never overlook failure to carry one out to carry out an order yeah to carry one out
[01:19:40] never overlook failure to carry one out I'm not sure what he means by that just do
[01:19:46] book I'm sure some people will give us some opinions on that one on the Facebook you when I release
[01:19:52] keep fit yourself and make certain that your men do too keep your own nerves under control
[01:20:00] and study your men's good for like when you want to comment if you're listening and you want to
[01:20:08] comment you have an opinion on that one put it on the Facebook post so it can follow the conversation
[01:20:14] as opposed to Twitter which is 140 characters you don't know me oh yeah it's easier to see it on
[01:20:19] Facebook when there's a legit question or someone has some legit big feedback if you put it on the
[01:20:25] thread for podcast number 81 when I post it that's the place to put it there in the replies
[01:20:32] when I can like convert back on that subject without having to go through 17,000 tweets yeah
[01:20:38] I mean go back and forth and just carry play the him but not him yeah yeah so it's all laid out on Facebook
[01:20:43] so it's a good place to have those little conversations Twitter we have different kinds of conversations
[01:20:49] sure last of all remember that success in word depends more than anything else on the will to win
[01:20:59] cool again now we got Monti saying Morales the most important we got Jocco saying leadership is
[01:21:06] the most important and you got Brigadier general Montsell saying that the will to win is the most important
[01:21:14] I'm not gonna actually argue with either one of these guys yeah it's guys are all uh got all kinds of
[01:21:21] experience about much more intense than mine speaking of intense experience more than mine
[01:21:30] there's a guy a pseudonym meaning a fake name basilisk in the guy wrote something called
[01:21:39] talks on leadership and the guy's actual name was Alfred Bern and he was a world war one
[01:21:46] and world war two veteran then he was a military historian and he's got a little section in here
[01:21:53] it's called being straight there's one trait in the character of a leader that above all things
[01:22:00] really counts and it perhaps counts in war even more than in peace being straight no amount of
[01:22:08] ability knowledge or cunning can ever make up for not being straight once those under him find out that
[01:22:17] a commander is absolutely straight in all those dealings with them and free from the slightest trade
[01:22:22] of self interest other than the self interest of which we are all guilty when striving for victory
[01:22:27] of causes we believe to be right they will love him as their leader trust him work for him follow
[01:22:33] him and should the occasion arise die for him with the fundamental ability of the British soldier
[01:22:42] which comes to the surface when things are at their worst so being straight with your people
[01:22:51] very important very important in fact perhaps his most important above all so now we got another
[01:23:01] fact or that's the most important thing now I'm gonna hear a little on leadership from field
[01:23:08] martial lord harming once again world war one and world war two veteran he also
[01:23:18] fought in the second battle of al-amine he was a wounded lost some fingers recovered got back to
[01:23:27] the fight so he says about leadership here there are some people who believe that leadership is
[01:23:32] something which is inborn or which you acquire automatically at a public school but neither of those
[01:23:38] things are true there are certain fundamental qualities which affect leadership in which depend to
[01:23:42] very large extent on upbringing and the moral and spiritual values which you can learn which you
[01:23:48] learn in your family and in your environment as a young man but there's no special way nor is there
[01:23:55] any special cast or class which has the prerogative of leadership there are many forms of leadership
[01:24:04] political parties have their leaders every big organization and industry or commerce all have their
[01:24:09] leaders and at the other end of the scale so do dance bands and so do gangs of thieves and smugglers
[01:24:17] there are many qualities that apply equity to every type of leader but you and I are concerned
[01:24:22] with one particular type of leadership to my mind the highest type of all and that is leadership
[01:24:29] on the battlefield and I believe it to be the highest type because it has to be exercised
[01:24:34] under conditions of great difficulty and considerable danger I would like to be quite I would like
[01:24:41] you to be quite clear about the conditions under which you will have to exercise leadership
[01:24:46] you will frequently be tired you may also be cold and wet and hungry and thirsty you may be
[01:24:54] dripping with sweat or you may be freezing with cold you won't know precisely what is going on
[01:25:01] you won't know exactly where the enemy is you certainly won't know what he is going to do
[01:25:07] or what his capabilities are of doing anything you may not know where your own people are
[01:25:14] or what they are going to do to put it briefly you've got to be able to exercise leadership
[01:25:20] in conditions of fatigue and fear uncertainty and ignorance and often in isolation
[01:25:28] that is what makes it extremely difficult and that is why leadership on the battlefield calls
[01:25:34] in my view for the highest qualities many qualities are required and leader different people
[01:25:42] have different views about which are more important in my opinion there are five outstanding
[01:25:48] mental and physical moral and spiritual qualities without which you cannot hope to be successful
[01:25:54] and a good leader on the battlefield the first of those qualities is a mental and physical one and that
[01:26:02] is fitness absolute fitness of mind and body so make sure you're getting your morning physical training
[01:26:14] in physical fitness mental fitness next then I would say you've got to have complete integrity
[01:26:24] you've got to be honest not only with yourselves but with the men you lead and the people with whom
[01:26:29] you work and honesty and integrity are things that you cannot compromise with you cannot alter
[01:26:37] if you do you will lose confidence and you will not be able to lead you must have complete integrity
[01:26:45] so that's the same thing as being straight not after that not in any
[01:26:55] next after that not in any order of priority but this is how I have put them down deep in my mind
[01:27:03] there is an enduring courage pretty well everyone can be brave for a few minutes most of us can
[01:27:09] if we steal ourselves to it take one pledge or make one decision or incur one risk but the
[01:27:16] sort of courage you must have to lead on the battlefield isn't enduring courage and one that you
[01:27:21] will go that will go on when other people falter one that will enable you to do what you know to be
[01:27:28] right irrespective of the danger or the difficulty contrary often contrary to the advice of well
[01:27:34] meaning friends so got to have courage next then you must have daring initiative
[01:27:45] initiative means doing right away what you might if you had time think of doing a few minutes
[01:27:53] later I like this if you wait for things to happen to you they will happen all right
[01:28:03] and here I am quoting the words of my predecessor also spoken here they will happen to you
[01:28:10] but they won't be what you like and they certainly won't bring you success initiative means
[01:28:16] seeing at once and very quickly what needs to be done making up your mind to do it and then
[01:28:21] seeing it through to the middle of bitter end so I love that one if you wait for things to happen to you
[01:28:30] they certainly will
[01:28:31] little bit more on will power here then you must have undonited will power the will power
[01:28:41] is the motive power it is what enables you to make yourself fit in mind and body
[01:28:48] to produce in you in your heart the courage the enduring courage that I spoke of
[01:28:53] to give you the courage to do your duty and to make the sacrifice that may be called from you
[01:28:58] it is the will power that forces you to take the initiative to make the plan to do what is required
[01:29:05] to see it through and that will power must be undonited it must never allow itself to be overcome or
[01:29:13] subdued perhaps the finest example living today of the power and influence for good of man
[01:29:20] with undonited will power is our prime minister in one of the critical periods of the last war
[01:29:26] he spoke certain words I am going to quote you now he said all the great struggles in history have
[01:29:33] been won by superior will power resting victory in the teeth of odds or upon the narrowest of margins
[01:29:43] it is the will power that is superior that can rest victory in the teeth of odds
[01:29:48] that is the type of will power that has got to be developed in a leader on the battlefield
[01:30:00] mobilize your will now he talks about some other qualities he talks about knowledge he talks
[01:30:08] about judgment he talks about team spirit saying because you cannot get success on the battlefield
[01:30:14] by yourself you've got to work with other people so obviously as a leader you have to have that
[01:30:23] spirit of teamwork and closing out he says there's one other thing I would like to say to you
[01:30:35] as british officers you will never have all you want all you need you'll be short of this or that
[01:30:42] or the other sometimes you will be short of men other times your equipment or weapons may not be as
[01:30:47] good as you think they ought to be normally you have as many as you would like you may be short of ammunition
[01:30:54] you may also be short of food and water or other necessary things when these circumstances arise
[01:31:01] as they do often throughout your service both in peace and war there's only one motto and that is to
[01:31:08] make certain that you do the very best you can with what you got don't belgate about what you have not
[01:31:15] got but get on and make certain you do your utmost with what you have got now to sum up what I've
[01:31:24] tried to say this afternoon I would like to put it like this first keep fit absolutely fit then be honest
[01:31:32] honest with yourselves and honest with those with whom you work then have courage and make it an
[01:31:38] enduring courage next be bold be daring and when there's a choice take the bold and daring course
[01:31:46] make the very most of what you have got and never never never give in
[01:31:53] yes do what you can with what you've got until you really like that one yeah yeah sometimes it
[01:32:08] starts hitting all right next there's a chapter in this book which is called discipline which makes me
[01:32:20] very happy and again I tried to censor myself from not just doing the entire chapter obviously you
[01:32:30] can buy this book if you want to see the whole thing there's a great point this first one is from
[01:32:38] field marshal Earl Wavel who was in the blue wars and he was in World War I in World War II
[01:32:47] lost his left eye in the battle of e-brays so we're talking a warrior here that was went back for
[01:32:55] service here's what he said about discipline discipline is teaching which makes a man do something
[01:33:03] which he would not unless he had learned that it was the right the proper and the expedient thing to do
[01:33:10] at its best it is instilled and maintained by pride in one's self in one's unit in one's
[01:33:20] profession only at its worst by fear of punishment so he's talking we want self discipline we
[01:33:29] don't want in post discipline that's what he's saying you don't want I don't want you doing this
[01:33:33] because you're scared of me if you don't do what I tell you I'm gonna beat you that's not what
[01:33:37] I want I want you saying I'm gonna do this because I want to do it here's a little something from
[01:33:43] Monti here and we're gonna get some disagreements going I'm gonna disagree with Monti sorry Monti
[01:33:48] well she were here to defend yourself okay on discipline Monti the basis of training must be self
[01:33:56] discipline cool a man must learn to be the master of himself and to keep in subjection the bad
[01:34:04] qualities in his makeup I love that self discipline can be developed by training in such things as
[01:34:12] conception of duty self control self respect endurance and so on we then have collective discipline
[01:34:20] and there's no doubt that the initial training in this subject is best carried out by drill
[01:34:24] men must be taught instinctively to obey orders whatever they are I do not believe men will
[01:34:37] fight voluntarily for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline the best form of discipline
[01:34:44] is subordination of self for the benefit of the community so I'm gonna make some comments on those
[01:34:51] number one when you say that you should obey orders regardless of what they are don't agree
[01:35:01] I don't agree with that I want my men to question my orders I want them to if I'm telling
[01:35:06] you to do something that they don't think is smart I want them to question me I want them to come
[01:35:11] up with then a better solution that's how we're gonna win even the moral thing too right
[01:35:16] like to obey orders regardless oh yeah for sure I want my whole team to be hey if this is the
[01:35:26] wrong thing to do we shouldn't be doing it yeah next the other one he says here is
[01:35:34] he says that people won't fight for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline I don't believe that
[01:35:39] that's true either and I think if you look at American history guys we didn't have this
[01:35:46] stricler of course there's there's discipline of course in the military there's imposed discipline
[01:35:51] in the military but the things that people and all soldiers have accomplished without stricting
[01:35:59] pose discipline is they've given their lives over and over no thousands and thousands and thousands
[01:36:04] hundreds of thousands of cases where men have given their lives not because not because I said
[01:36:11] or because the leader said go and charge this machine gun nest that's that's that's not why they did it
[01:36:17] they did it because they believed in the cause hmm so I don't agree with that when I think that
[01:36:24] men will fight voluntarily for a cause without the iron bonds of discipline and you know when I think
[01:36:31] they do it I think they do it when that causes freedom so when the cause is freedom I believe
[01:36:38] men will fight without the bonds of discipline over them and this idea that the best form of
[01:36:49] discipline is the subordination of self for the benefit of the community I don't actually
[01:36:53] agree without one either I think the best form of discipline is when there is alignment in the
[01:36:59] discipline the discipline for the team and the individual bring success and survival and freedom
[01:37:10] and when those things are aligned that's when I think you get the finest form of discipline
[01:37:17] now he recovers a little bit from my criticism here and of course to everyone that is
[01:37:25] wondering why I'm sort of making fun of myself it's pretty embarrassing to be sitting here
[01:37:33] and disagreeing with a guy like Monti so please don't take me the wrong way
[01:37:39] just giving my opinion here and I'm in no way comparing my military knowledge
[01:37:46] with general Montgomery and he doesn't say this the basis of all discipline is self discipline
[01:37:55] which this is beautiful when I agree with that 100% this self discipline may come from within a person
[01:38:01] or may be imposed upon him from without don't agree not only last a little while whatever it's
[01:38:08] or it involves the idea of self control and self restraint that is true but there is I think it's called
[01:38:22] situational discipline I think or what is that I could I could have the expression wrong but I think
[01:38:28] it is situational just meaning like if you're in a certain situation you'll have you'll be really self
[01:38:38] discipline but once you get out you're not you know like you ever you ever watched
[01:38:44] you watch the big is a show called the biggest loser no so yeah that's a way people that are
[01:38:51] having weight problems they go on a show they get fed certain things made to work out and he lose a
[01:38:56] bunch of weight and then they win the program and then when they go back home and they're not around that
[01:39:00] imposed discipline right they lose it right that's my point yeah my point is that that impose discipline
[01:39:07] it works you have the impos in closer they're watching you what I would prefer is to have someone that
[01:39:16] makes out change in their mindset and develops self discipline right now sometimes you can get that
[01:39:23] from impose discipline and you realize like you get shown the freedom that discipline gives you
[01:39:28] and then you carry on with it like a lot of people that listen to the podcast and they've done
[01:39:33] incredible things with their lives because we weren't there to impose discipline on them but they
[01:39:37] recognize themselves maybe they said okay you know what I'm gonna get up for the next two weeks
[01:39:41] and get up early I'm gonna work out I'm gonna eat healthy two weeks go by they've lost a little bit
[01:39:46] of body fat they've gained a little bit of muscle and they feel good and all of a sudden they
[01:39:51] realize the benefits of discipline and so they change their mindset and they become more discipline
[01:39:56] human beings yeah that's what I like yeah when I don't like is it all run a boot camp on you
[01:40:02] and yell at you and scream in person I think people want me to yell and scream I get that I think
[01:40:07] once or twice a day someone will say you need to make an alarm clock where you yell and tell us to tell
[01:40:12] me to get out of bed yeah and I say it gets psychological warfare but I'm not gonna yell in
[01:40:16] psychological warfare because yelling isn't an effective tool compared to actually speaking to someone
[01:40:23] and letting them understand why it's important yeah that's the preferred tool okay usually
[01:40:28] do you got to yell at people occasionally yes you do occasionally not very often though yeah
[01:40:34] but yeah yeah right now with that situational discipline because even I think about what's worse
[01:40:39] somebody yelling at you or someone whispering at you it's actually worse isn't it?
[01:40:46] somebody's in a lot of ways yeah to me it's worse sure yelling and screaming it doesn't
[01:40:52] no and it really doesn't really matter what they're saying either if you choose yelling or
[01:40:56] whispering because like you know even if they're telling you a normal thing like hey um here
[01:41:01] this is what I want from the store I want avocados tomatoes and you know some wine but what if I
[01:41:06] whisper it to you hey joker thank you my fruit me out actually yeah yeah yeah so it didn't
[01:41:13] sure about that example yeah except no no you get that that's the point it doesn't really matter
[01:41:17] what they're saying whispering versus you oh yeah definitely has a different psychological
[01:41:21] fact for sure that doesn't really freaks me out you be in a joker when you pick up a bottle of wine
[01:41:28] you think no actually I can I'm leaving yeah the wine can it makes it extra awkward for sure
[01:41:37] alright so now we get into another part on discipline right here and this is Sir John Furtiske
[01:41:44] and what you pay attention to this one because we start going sideways I haven't my mind rather
[01:41:50] those excellent but generally unthaking persons who shrink with horror from the idea of a man's
[01:41:57] abdicating his civil rights what they say a man must obey even an unjust command under pain it
[01:42:05] may be of death it is monstrous for purposes of civil life it might be monstrous but not for the
[01:42:13] purposes in of implicit obedience which is the thing that matters in the army let there be justices
[01:42:24] far as possible by all means but as a general principle it is better for an army that an in
[01:42:30] justice should be done than that an order should be disobeyed this however is an argument that
[01:42:37] cannot appeal to our imaginary objecter because he has read no military history so that's just
[01:42:47] very disturbing this whole thing and it's really doesn't comply with anything that I say
[01:42:53] which is I want you to question orders and if they're not good orders you shouldn't obey him
[01:42:57] and he's saying no no no it's better to do something unjust as long as you're obeying orders
[01:43:01] and I get a little bit of research about john for the skew and you know obviously I don't agree
[01:43:08] with this and actually in the new version of the book the the guy that writes the forward to the
[01:43:14] new version of this specifically calls out john for the skew and says we removed him he's
[01:43:23] gone from the book and what I found out about him was yes he was in the army he was a major in the
[01:43:31] army but I don't think he was in any combat and what I do know is that he was the royal librarian
[01:43:39] from 1905 until 1926 and he died in 1902 so he didn't go to World War I really all these other
[01:43:47] guys are World War I World War II veterans he was the the royal librarian and it's interesting
[01:43:54] when he says because he has read no military he doesn't said because he's never been in combat before
[01:43:59] he says he's read that cup the person that would object this is never read military history
[01:44:04] well actually yeah he's going with a theory yeah he's going with a theory yeah and and if you want to
[01:44:09] take this and stretch it out more broadly this attitude you know a hate World War I hate World War I
[01:44:18] because it was so based on obedience and you are going to charge we're going to charge this
[01:44:27] trench all 7,000 of us are going to charge tomorrow morning at 0630 where to go over the top
[01:44:33] where to get mode down my machine guns and then then people are going to fall us and do the same thing
[01:44:37] and that they the guys were so obedient and brave and just selfless to do that
[01:44:46] but this attitude is what made that war so devastating because no one said hey wait a second
[01:44:53] this doesn't seem smart to me I just watched you know a two three four battalions are two
[01:45:01] three four regiments get mode down and now you're telling me I'm going to do the same thing tomorrow
[01:45:08] with my men no I want you to question my orders I want you to say no if I'm making you do
[01:45:16] something that doesn't make sense I want you to say no and if I can't explain it to you in a
[01:45:22] logical way then I should rethink what I'm saying to you so Mr. John Fordiskew
[01:45:34] we're going to have to say that we've kind of changed our opinion on on obedience and there are
[01:45:39] more important things than obedience in a team in a military team and in the business world
[01:45:44] here's another piece from the Sconeback General Williams slim any army without discipline is no
[01:45:55] more than a mob alternating between frightened sheep and beasts of prey discipline as the British
[01:46:01] soldiers demonstrated in peace and war is the old Christian virtue of unselfishness of standing by
[01:46:08] your neighbor your comrade it is the sacrifice of a man's comfort inclination safety even life for others
[01:46:16] for something greater than himself it is the refusal to be the weak link in the chain that snaps
[01:46:24] under under strain then this is a great little story here one paragraph back to the book once
[01:46:32] from the safety of a well dug command post I looked down on a battery vault artillery in action
[01:46:39] in the African bush it was firing at five rounds per gun per minute and idly I timed the nearest gun
[01:46:51] in that area the enemy unfortunately had complete local air supremacy and guns unless engaged in
[01:46:59] some vital task were ordered to remain silent whenever hostile aircraft appeared
[01:47:06] gradually dominating all other sounds came the dull drone of bombers flying low but the guns went
[01:47:13] on firing five rounds per gun per minute for they were supporting an infantry attack
[01:47:21] cover move by the way the first stick of bombs fell around the gun I was watching
[01:47:27] some of its crew were hit the dry brush roared into flame which spread instantly to the camouflage
[01:47:38] nets over the gun it vanished from my sight in smoke and flame yet from the very midst of that
[01:47:48] inferno at the exact intervals came the flash and thud of the firing gun five rounds per minute
[01:47:59] per gun never a falter never a second out no weak link there the discipline held
[01:48:10] that's pretty awesome
[01:48:21] sections here talking about duty and service and we're going to first start with Colonel George
[01:48:28] Henderson a British officer who fought in Egypt and at the Battle of Kassassin and
[01:48:42] he fought in the Boer Wars as well and he talks about waterloo here we go back to the book
[01:48:48] no incidents more familiar in our military history than the stubborn resistance of the British
[01:48:54] line at Waterloo through the long hours of the mid-summer day silent and immovable squares and
[01:49:01] squadrons stood in the trampled corn harassed by an almost incestant fire of cannon and musketry
[01:49:09] to which they were forbidden to make reply not a moment but heard some cry of agony not a moment
[01:49:19] but some comrade fell headlong into the furrows yet as bullets of the skirmishers hailed around them
[01:49:29] and the great shot tore through the tight packed ranks the word was passed quietly
[01:49:37] closing on the center men and as the sun neared at setting the regiments still shoulder to shoulder
[01:49:45] stood fast upon the ground they had held at noon the spectacle is characteristic
[01:49:54] in good fortune and in ill it is rare indeed that a British regiment does not hold together
[01:50:02] and this indestructible cohesion best of all qualities that an armed body can possess is based
[01:50:09] not merely on hereditary resolution but on mutual confidence and mutual respect the man and the
[01:50:18] ranks has implicit faith in his officer the officer and almost unbounded belief in the valor
[01:50:26] and discipline of his men and that I've talked about this and people want to know what makes
[01:50:38] the seal teams do well the thing that makes the seal teams do well is the bond that holds
[01:50:45] them together and that bond is so strong that it's unbreakable and that's why seals do well in combat
[01:50:55] because we have a bond that is unbreakable stronger than anything that's going to get thrown at us
[01:51:00] the brotherhood is going to stand
[01:51:02] and I'm going to close this book out with two more quotes and speaking of water
[01:51:12] this one is from Wellington and this is a very simple quote he said my rule was always to do
[01:51:22] the business of the day in the day and I I was reading this book the other day and I actually
[01:51:31] posted something about it but I I I didn't realize I was thinking about this but we have a
[01:51:38] of saying in the seal teams plan your dive and dive your plan is this thing so when you're
[01:51:43] when you're doing a combat swimmer attack which is when you're on a re-breather and you're diving
[01:51:48] underwater and when if you've never dove before if you don't understand this it's very hard to
[01:51:54] comprehend what combat swimmer is like but I'll give you a real quick brief when you're doing a
[01:51:59] combat dive on a re-breather you basically can't see anything it's nighttime you're down at
[01:52:08] 10 12 15 feet underwater it's black you can't see anything there's no like fish swimming around
[01:52:16] there's no sea life to look at there's no coral reef it's black you can't see anything
[01:52:21] the only thing you can actually see is something called an attack board which an attack board
[01:52:28] sounds really cool but let me tell you what it is it's a piece of plastic used to be wood
[01:52:35] that has on it a depth gauge a compass and a watch to time and so you put little tiny
[01:52:45] chemlights little glowing chemlights and you actually tape them up so that they're barely
[01:52:50] emitting any light at all and you put one by the stopwatch one by the compass and one by the depth
[01:52:56] gauge and when you're underwater so you have those things they're basically strapped onto this board
[01:53:03] that you hold I don't know it's like like the about the size of a piece of paper right
[01:53:07] of eight and a half by 11 piece paper that's about how big this board is and on it you've got
[01:53:10] your depth gauge your compass and your stopwatch and you can barely see them they're glowing very
[01:53:16] faintly and when you're underwater that's all you can see it is just that you can't see anything
[01:53:23] else occasionally you'll get like some weird abstract light from the moon or something but
[01:53:29] even that to rare because you're down underwater and if you've ever been in water with low visibility
[01:53:35] sometimes that sometimes it's actually hard to see the attack board that's too feet in front
[01:53:40] of your face so then what you're doing is you're looking at that compass you're looking at that
[01:53:45] depth gauge and you're looking at the stopwatch and you have pre-planned legs that you're going on
[01:53:52] you're going to go this long this this bearing this long this depth for this time and when I say
[01:53:58] it's so you're kicking looking at this board for an hour and 17 minutes then you're going to make
[01:54:05] a 90 degree turn and you're going to go for another 48 minutes and then you're going to make a
[01:54:10] right turn for 12 minutes and you're going to hit your target then you're going to turn around
[01:54:14] do some other route back out as long as you can stay underwater you stand a water that eventually
[01:54:19] run out of oxygen you come to the surface and you swim the rest of the way to your extract
[01:54:25] any visions of the glory and the the fun of being a seal this is it's not it's work
[01:54:34] and it's hard work and you have to concentrate the whole time and you got to make sure you don't go to
[01:54:40] shallow or too deep if you go too shallow you'll be seeing if you go to deep your go off the
[01:54:45] dive tables that you're allowed to be on oxygen for so you got to focus the whole time and by the
[01:54:51] way you're in a spare and your buddy that's with you he's even more miserable than you are because
[01:54:56] he has no idea what's going on he's just trying to keep up with you because for some reason the
[01:55:00] way you dive the way you put your body when you have the attack board you can swim a little bit
[01:55:05] faster than the guy that's looking around and making sure that you're not going to hit anything
[01:55:08] and make sure not so there's only one attack board there there's a one attack board for
[01:55:13] it prepare okay sometimes we would make to make a smaller attack board just because it was
[01:55:18] so much more efficient to fly with them but you can't fly if you're the buddy you can't be
[01:55:24] just looking at the attack board you have to look around attack board the attack board you can't
[01:55:27] that's what we call the attack board so with all that the reason I'm telling you all this is that
[01:55:34] when you're underwater it's really easy to get confused and turned around and sometimes you go
[01:55:40] over big pieces of metal that are in the water and your compass starts to like wander around
[01:55:45] and you can't communicate with your buddy man that's what it sounds like you've got so
[01:55:51] we know we have squeeze signals and sometimes we carry grease pens to write but it's never there's
[01:55:57] no real effective way to communicate underwater so you're just in this dark just cold
[01:56:04] blind situation for three two three four hours at a time and the saying is that we have
[01:56:16] is plan your dive and dive your plan because if you and I go underwater and then we start trying to
[01:56:21] adjust things while we're underwater and we just we think we're going to do something different once
[01:56:25] we go first of all you and I're going to be thinking two different things and it's going to be a disaster
[01:56:29] so we plan our dive and dive our plan and that's reminded me of this statement do the business of
[01:56:37] the day in the day right get done what you say you're going to get done do it and how simple is that
[01:56:44] and it's like dive your plan and what I said the other day I said plan what you're going to do
[01:56:50] and then do what you plan that's real simple and and I think about how far you're going to
[01:56:56] think of where you will be in two weeks if every day you plan what you're going to do and then you do
[01:57:02] what you plan it's amazing yeah it seems to say that that's what we're talking about a few weeks ago
[01:57:10] where it's like distractions that's the thing you know I've seen there's like just industries of
[01:57:16] distractions yeah for sure you never wake up I was explaining to my eight-year-old daughter of the
[01:57:21] other day that they designed because she was playing a game on iPad and I said oh what are you learning
[01:57:27] from that and she said oh what do you mean I said oh are you learning anything from that
[01:57:33] and she said well you have to get these rings and I said oh so you're not learning anything from that
[01:57:39] and she said I don't I said you know what they do they make that game to make you want to play it more
[01:57:44] or there's no there's no end to the game to play the way they just want you to play that
[01:57:49] game keep clicking on that that's yeah there look you know of course I'm just being a total jerk I'm
[01:57:54] like yeah look at how it works look at you look at you you look at you you look at you holding on to
[01:58:01] this thing and she doesn't fall for this anymore when she was younger I used to go up and
[01:58:05] and press her head as if her head was getting softer and I look at her like oh man how long
[01:58:10] have you been on this for you said I don't know and it's a I think if you stop now your brain might
[01:58:16] harden back up eventually do the same thing with her muscles like you're eating like chips or
[01:58:22] some way too many chips like you're muscle getting like all soft right now yeah she's young
[01:58:27] just for so it works but they do they plan these things so they addicted yeah
[01:58:34] addicted those iPad ones there's no and well everything is designed right right now you
[01:58:39] you talk about the Facebook app that shows the little thing that shows oh yeah like yeah
[01:58:43] you're gonna mess it up and this might be the message that I've been waiting for right variable
[01:58:48] reward it might not be so that's the thing that's if you know guaranteed it what it's going to
[01:58:53] be consistently it's less addictive it's called variable reward yeah that's what I'm saying but
[01:58:57] you the everyone in their mind is thinking this might be yeah this might be the big one exactly I'm
[01:59:01] getting contacted by by tenacious D they saw my tweet they're getting back at me they're going to
[01:59:08] come on the podcast we're attending it's today's the jack black and Kyle gas no it's a movie it's a band
[01:59:17] from a movie they have been in a movie yes and they have a jack black jack black
[01:59:23] actor no that's a black and not a new musician okay got you school of rock that's a great show
[01:59:30] hell that's not a movie that's jack black no no he isn't active like I said in a
[01:59:35] talk to be here remember who got so why do we just talk about oh yeah because I think in
[01:59:42] all this might be the tweet that I was waiting for from tenacious D sure so I got to check my
[01:59:48] twitter 47 times a minute yeah no not happening you can you get you don't have a tweet from
[01:59:55] tenacious D that's not there they didn't tweet you yeah so don't check your twitter going do
[02:00:00] something productive yeah but so and that's when you're already distracted so basically the
[02:00:10] point was you know do your plan your day or do you know and do the plan right so because no one
[02:00:17] plan your day and do what you plan yeah that's it so you know and plans to what's really jacked up
[02:00:24] is if you actually took what you did in a day and you wrote it down and planned it I bet you could
[02:00:31] get it done in so much less time like right now I've got a lot of stuff going on right now
[02:00:37] and I'm doing things that normally take me two hours I'm doing in 46 minutes same quality by the way
[02:00:44] did it's getting after it right but you got to put a little suspense date on something and say
[02:00:49] let's do here you got to get it done and then you just sit down and make it happen yeah that's
[02:00:54] what you need to do oh it's it's one of those simple but I need these easy things but this is why
[02:01:00] so you would you put in a way you put these kind of parameters on what you're gonna do and if like
[02:01:06] I if okay I'm making a plan and I'm sticking to the plan right that's what I'm doing so I plan to
[02:01:10] do XYZX you know all these things yep and if so basically right when you say okay here's the
[02:01:15] plan you outline it if it's not in the plan you just don't do it it's so yeah so distractions no
[02:01:23] one plans like hey tomorrow I'm gonna just eat like crap tomorrow that's the plan that's never the plan
[02:01:30] you know but if you don't have any plan or nothing sure you allow those things to come in so
[02:01:34] if you're like okay tomorrow and you're not gonna plan the whole day you're not gonna plan every
[02:01:38] meal you're not gonna if you did you'd be real effective yeah if you stay on locked right
[02:01:45] so if you get the meal prep the night before like when you go through those phases where you're
[02:01:49] cooking seven chicken breasts and you're just red you got everything laid out one day too so yeah
[02:01:53] well there you go yeah really people do that yeah for those degrees and it works yes sir yeah
[02:01:58] exactly right so and isn't realistic and really when you think about it kind of is if you're committed
[02:02:03] to it well what's crazy is is it takes more work upfront how long does it take to prepare all your
[02:02:09] meals for the week and by the way I don't do this yeah but how long I've done it before how long
[02:02:14] to take prepare with meals it takes you two hours two hours and 20 minutes let's say
[02:02:19] amount of time by the way you get done preparing those and you save time in the week right
[02:02:24] because now you're not sitting around just redepointing your pots and pans redepointing your stove
[02:02:29] setting that to all that other stuff you actually are gonna save time if you plan your day
[02:02:36] yeah and then you do your plan yeah and think about just if you use that meal prep example where okay you
[02:02:44] don't typically we don't plan our every meal for a week typically just don't do that but when you do
[02:02:49] the meal prep planning situation you're saying we meaning human beings in general where everybody
[02:02:54] yeah that typical person so that's a good example so when you do that now boom that your meals
[02:03:01] an element of your life that typically isn't quote unquote planned is now planned so now those
[02:03:08] parameters are set so anything outside of those parameters do you just don't really think about
[02:03:12] as much you know and one they kind of enter you it's real obvious like hey that's not part of this
[02:03:16] plan what the hell you know it's like it's more of a life but if you don't plan it they come in it's kind
[02:03:20] like whatever there's no parameters there anyway in my head so that goes for everything you do so just
[02:03:25] like how you're saying yeah have a lot of stuff so you plan okay I'm gonna do this here do this now
[02:03:29] do this at this time finish it by this time all this stuff those parameters are set so the
[02:03:33] distractions have a way harder time to get in so in everyday life you can make some ambiguous goal hey I
[02:03:39] want to eat better no plan by the way just it's an ambiguous goal there's no parameters on there
[02:03:44] so you take one missed step you you know you were at the stop light for longer than you expected
[02:03:51] now you're late for this now I'm pressed for a time there's the McDonald's right and it it'll just
[02:03:55] sneak right in but if you got those parameters then you'll be able to make Donald's nope
[02:03:59] not part of my plan right now yeah my plan I got to you know I got to execute yeah and another thing
[02:04:03] I if you're gonna plan your day you should actually plan to have time in there that has nothing
[02:04:12] in it right so you should you should plan to have a half an hour where you're you're gonna
[02:04:17] address problems right okay so that way of problems because they're gonna come up
[02:04:21] yeah you gotta you gotta have your your free time and by free I mean free to go make other things
[02:04:28] happen and just and make things good but what you shouldn't do is say because I'll tell you there's
[02:04:34] some things that I have a really hard time like with the podcast I'll keep preparing the podcast
[02:04:39] I'll just go I'm just feeling the time I know I go beyond that because there's another story
[02:04:45] that ties into something else and I'm gonna go pull out another book and by the way I got
[02:04:48] to run the out of time to get it from Amazon so I'm gonna go to the library you know what I mean
[02:04:52] it's just you go down where I could prepare for a podcast forever and not be ready for it and so
[02:04:58] I have to put myself in check and say okay draw the line on this level of depth on this thing
[02:05:04] now I might make a footnote and I've got a cool category now on my computer that's you know
[02:05:11] tangents where I what I opened a tangent and I didn't close it on the podcast so now we're gonna
[02:05:16] be able to enter them at a different time when when time allows because I can get focused on that
[02:05:22] one subject so that's pretty cool yeah but it takes discipline to do that because otherwise I would
[02:05:29] just go down every rabbit I could open up and you take a book like this and there's so many
[02:05:33] rabbit holes in there it's almost impossible to stay out of them it gets kind of ridiculous
[02:05:38] yeah in a way so my point is playing playing your day and then execute your plan if you do
[02:05:47] that it's gonna make a huge difference in your life and let's go look up you look up and
[02:05:55] a month two months three months the amount of stuff that you've gotten done is ridiculous
[02:06:02] and I'll tell you one of the ways that I do do that myself as I just pass myself with that I
[02:06:07] would say I'm gonna do things and you have to have to do them yeah they are. If let's say with this
[02:06:13] podcast good example we do this podcast once a week we've held the line really well on that
[02:06:19] if we didn't if we said you know what let's just put the podcast out when we put it out right
[02:06:27] if that was the mindset we had from the beginning we would probably I'm gonna guess that we would
[02:06:33] have less than half of the podcasts would have been put out that's my guess because we were to
[02:06:38] said you know what hey I got a train this week and I'm gonna miss that and I haven't read the
[02:06:43] book that I was gonna read so because right now bro oh I've got 15 minutes that little half hour
[02:06:50] of my schedule or I have nothing guess what I'm doing in that half hour I'm doing 22 minutes worth
[02:06:54] of reading of a book that's coming up yeah that's what I'm doing if we didn't have the
[02:06:59] discipline structure in place that probably wouldn't be happening yeah that probably wouldn't be
[02:07:05] we'd be going oh you know what little time with bi-Hey bro yeah let's let's let's let's give this
[02:07:09] week a visit so much easier yeah yeah you know what I was gonna go going hang out today and
[02:07:14] only want to do this today no we're doing it yeah we we signed up for it yep totally now
[02:07:20] could it get to a point where said you know what every two weeks we've mentioned that before
[02:07:24] people didn't like that idea yeah you know why because I like that discipline yeah why would
[02:07:35] you know why because I'm basically I'm basically confining myself that doing something productive
[02:07:40] as opposed to watching YouTube videos right about cats because there's some good YouTube videos
[02:07:47] right there's some good YouTube videos but there's also a lot of them are not good
[02:07:54] and you're not getting anything out of them yeah and man the ones that they rack up for you
[02:07:59] when you've just got done watching one yeah the ones that they rack up for you or every single one
[02:08:05] of them what do they rack up I think they rack up for on top and for on bottom when you're
[02:08:09] little screen yeah and every one of them is like a clickbait right every one of them is a clickbait
[02:08:14] it's crazy yeah it's they do that obviously yeah because it it has a lot to do with
[02:08:22] everything that you've you've won for sure so yeah it's gonna be it's the next video is always
[02:08:28] just like it's a 90% relevant to what you specifically want right there and that is why
[02:08:34] that is why you got to get angry at though you know you know if you have that uh you know how you
[02:08:39] have that that way that you ever came your anger management right by but you read that it was like
[02:08:46] you you had low self esteem that's why you're getting mad well when you get that when you get
[02:08:51] that next rack of YouTube videos staring at you you should be getting pissed because you know what they're
[02:08:57] trying to do you're trying to get you to try to take your time away from you yeah and by the way
[02:09:02] they're making money from you you click that next thing you they're making their making money from
[02:09:06] what you're doing and so they've they've set this system up to make you click that thing yeah
[02:09:11] so you're a mark is what you know you're a mark you're a marker look at you falling for it
[02:09:15] everything you have yeah that's how I click drinking too by the way that is legit like oh I'm falling
[02:09:21] for a trick that my brain is playing on me I'm falling for that trick I'm falling for that trick
[02:09:26] that and like I said it's hard too because it's mixed in with positive stuff on YouTube there's
[02:09:33] a really good quality stuff on YouTube there's some great knowledge you can gain from YouTube for sure
[02:09:39] and if you're good at justifying things yeah yeah that's true too it's a really scary but my point
[02:09:44] is I don't want to sit here and bag on YouTube because it's an incredible source of information
[02:09:51] if you keep it informational but it's real easy to get sideways on that and they somehow know
[02:09:58] they can attach like watching a street fight too because I watch street fights or I watch a
[02:10:04] you know a UFC fighter I'll watch a clip or I'll watch a submission they know how to drag you in
[02:10:09] to like those clickbait titles of the guy fighting in the kangaroo yeah man versus kangaroo
[02:10:18] unbelievable right and of course you're thinking yourself okay well what would I do if I
[02:10:23] did fight a kangaroo yeah I live in America and I'm not fighting in the kangaroo but somehow I
[02:10:27] got to click on that video you see what else such garbage so good job YouTube and I'm not going to be
[02:10:34] a soccer over here no don't be alarmed give yourself a limit yeah seeing and that goes back to
[02:10:39] give yourself like a click limit on those things yeah or just set your plan right give yourself
[02:10:46] those parameters but you won't it's it even me thinking about it right now it really after you
[02:10:52] can explain to there it really puts it into perspective and all the things you ever I mean you're
[02:10:57] different than I think I think a lot of people where sometimes people only make plans if like
[02:11:02] they have important stuff something that's important I got work stuff right I got this to do
[02:11:07] this there's like 10 things on the list which actually seems like a pretty big to do this if you think
[02:11:11] 10 in one day you know how many things you do in a day that you can get distracted from a lot of them yeah
[02:11:20] more than 10 it's like a lot and that goes everything everything from like the sweat the day you wake
[02:11:25] up or not the day but the time you wake up what you eat every single time by the way
[02:11:31] oh the TV watcher don't watch I get every second of the day if it had a parameter on it
[02:11:39] and you'd be just laser focus on all your goals instead of these ambiguous who or what
[02:11:44] yeah lose weight or I want to I need to I don't know XYZ more yeah and I'll tell you
[02:11:50] nothing the plan doesn't take that much time to put together yeah and how you say it's it'll
[02:11:56] end up saving you time oh for sure it'll end up in one way another 10 minutes that you spend
[02:12:01] planning the next day we'll save you four hours yeah you can usually get done everything you have to
[02:12:07] get done in like half the time yeah half the time it's crazy and it's weird too because I don't
[02:12:12] I mean there's a busy people out there I don't want to make it sound like there's some
[02:12:15] some people that are really busy yeah but I get the single mom she's got two three kids
[02:12:22] she's got two three jobs yeah she doesn't you know what she's listening this conversation going
[02:12:27] yeah no kid yeah no kid she even wants youtube yeah she's in the game 24 seven yeah well
[02:12:32] not she's in the game 20 because she's worth she's sleeping for her right 20 yeah she's keeping it
[02:12:38] together yeah and when you say there's busy yeah there are two things to that yeah there are busy
[02:12:44] people you know that's how those people get those like the single moms or the single dads
[02:12:49] they get the kind of what I just said they are in a situation they have no choice in it
[02:12:56] right after yeah that's not no choice they get after they're like all I'm going to get this
[02:12:59] done they got to their friend they're looking at their kid they're looking at their three-year-old
[02:13:03] kid that that three-year-old kid has nothing without that mom getting on the grind and going to
[02:13:10] the restaurant yeah and working as a waitress or whatever or she's working her job whatever she's
[02:13:18] doing yeah just putting it together no is exactly Tuesday three weeks from now I'm at four
[02:13:24] forty six she knows where she's gonna be yeah she knows exactly where yeah I mean I don't
[02:13:29] come on you know compared to the average person we don't know and then
[02:13:34] compared to the average where you definitely know but you're not even like a hundred percent
[02:13:37] sure which I've been doing in an hour because you know cruising could interlude at any time
[02:13:43] and could might just be cruising is a very ambiguous activity but then go to the other side of
[02:13:48] the spectrum of busy people I mean they're busy because they don't plan you know that's
[02:13:53] definitely true and yeah I'm so busy all the time meanwhile no no productivity yeah or
[02:13:59] or very little limited limited true plan your day execute you plan all right last
[02:14:09] little quote from this this is Frederick the Great the Battle of Colin in 1757 and there were some
[02:14:21] troops that were a red a couple different versions again speaking of rabbit holes or
[02:14:26] start going down these rabbit holes I read two different versions of this there was either
[02:14:29] troops that were hesitating to attack or there were troops that were actually retreating
[02:14:36] and to these troops Frederick the Great said dogs would you live forever
[02:14:43] and another way that was translated was you cursive rascals would you live forever
[02:14:53] and was he saying this to you saying that to his own troops right okay that are
[02:14:58] leaving either either hesitating to attack or they're or they're retreating and he said dogs
[02:15:04] yeah kind of barbarians yeah no what would you live forever no is that what you're looking for
[02:15:11] to live forever yeah no you shouldn't be and you know I I think that's a good way to wrap up
[02:15:19] that book because like we said those two quotes always do the business of the day in the day
[02:15:28] so plan what you do and do what you plan and dogs you cursive rascals would you live forever
[02:15:42] let me answer that for you know you won't and we're here talking about a book we talk about a
[02:15:51] book today and we talk about leadership and that's awesome but you got to start by leading
[02:15:56] yourself by doing what you say you will do that's integrity personal integrity when you say
[02:16:06] that you're going to do something that they talked about being straight today it's talking
[02:16:10] about personal integrity that starts with yourself by doing what you actually say you are going to
[02:16:18] do by not hesitating and waiting got to lead yourself so get moving don't wait do what you plan
[02:16:33] and do it today because you don't get to live forever and the clock is ticking and I think that's
[02:16:52] all I've got for tonight and echo since we are not hesitating right now if you could without
[02:16:59] hesitation please explain to people how they might be able to support this podcast if they want to
[02:17:11] sure of course because we don't want to live forever actually Conan the Barbarian didn't say that
[02:17:20] he didn't say he didn't say much in Conan the Barbarian that's a few lines but not that much
[02:17:25] his girlfriend girl that ends up being his girlfriend then she dies later but whatever oh she says
[02:17:38] when they hesitated or when they're about to do something nuts she says do you want to live forever
[02:17:43] than they just charge okay well there you go she thinks exactly yeah that's the exact usage
[02:17:48] anyway speaking of not hesitating so kettlebells I'm talking about on it but this is kind of
[02:17:56] this relevant reminded me I kind of meant to it earlier before I started recording so I hear good
[02:18:04] things right kettlebells and I'm a little familiar I'll incorporate them here and there but
[02:18:11] you know I just hear more and more so I'm like hey I'm gonna make this a big part of the
[02:18:15] you know the routine the program yeah you do kettlebells obviously yes how much dumbbell stuff
[02:18:26] do you like dumbbell I actually don't use a lot of dumbbells and there you have a big dumbbell guy
[02:18:31] yeah like even like bench right yeah I don't know man how well is that some like bench like
[02:18:37] people will say hey how much can you bench yeah I don't know man not enough that's my answer
[02:18:42] so long time well you know I back to the kettlebell so starting kettlebells
[02:18:51] but I got and you know you learn the tip be careful with kettlebells if you're doing the kettlebells
[02:18:56] yeah you know how they see yeah start off light this I'd say with kettlebells more so
[02:19:00] than you because when you throw a kettle that thing it's not like a dumbbell is like you grab a
[02:19:05] dumbbell it has a perfect handle each side of the dumbbells perfectly balanced the same exact
[02:19:10] with but kettlebell has a handle then it's on the thing it'll flip around it'll break your
[02:19:14] loop right you can break your hand or when you're swinging them you know the one that you go
[02:19:18] I don't know all the terms sorry but the one you grab it with the two hands it's not swing yeah
[02:19:22] kettlebell the basic one yeah you know the boss wait between your legs yep but I'm like swinging
[02:19:27] it and I'm like oh what if this what if my balance was off or I don't know whatever and the kettlebell
[02:19:33] hit my chin you being a lot of pain bro it can break your chin if you have your chin you know even
[02:19:37] if you had like a 62 pound kettlebell in break your chin be careful with that anyway so to make things
[02:19:46] actually technically they're not what I got the on it ones the the wear wolf you know and the
[02:19:52] champion of that and you think when you compare them to the regular kettlebells um they're the
[02:19:57] kettlebells around right the regular ones so you think oh you know the design and ones with the
[02:20:02] wear wolf they might be kind of awkward because they're not like perfectly uniform but guess what
[02:20:08] the balance when they make them yeah so they're just as safe but
[02:20:14] so we're gonna be careful this I'm I'm explaining the new emergence of kettlebells in my work out yeah
[02:20:24] and you like them I like them a lot and the point is don't hesitate right because you know how you
[02:20:29] need to do more kettlebells and big and big U.S. goal that's what it is no parameters
[02:20:35] but I was like you know what today's the day I'm gonna do I'm gonna this is gonna be the workout
[02:20:39] this is so my workout was you know you want numbers I'll keep you numbers so what I did
[02:20:46] met con kettlebells the wear wolf so those are 62 pounds each and two the double boom so
[02:20:53] it's like a D I don't know if this is an actual kettlebell official movement I think it is
[02:20:58] you go it's like a kettlebell swing two of them outside of the hips narrow stance up to
[02:21:05] clean okay you clean it right and then press it right and then back down press
[02:21:09] squat boom boom okay and press yes so I do five reps and then five burpees
[02:21:17] walk in a circle 35 second yeah five reps again so I do that six times
[02:21:25] to click I don't know eight minutes eight and that was a mess I was the same as my other
[02:21:31] macumbo with the kettlebells and this kind of the squat probably it's weird I used to do that
[02:21:36] with a bar it's there's a lot of little muscles in there yeah that's what makes kettlebell
[02:21:42] is good is that there's unstable there less stable than a barbell yeah and they move awkwardly
[02:21:48] yeah so you have to use more energy and more strength to keep them under control yeah so
[02:21:54] it's working some muscles that you're not used to most likely yeah and you're it's
[02:21:57] it's interesting because you're using like you can get into this kind of it's not weird
[02:22:03] but it this flow of like you know like when it swings down it's not like oh it doesn't jerk you
[02:22:10] down it will if you're not ready for it but if you kind of know after you get used to it it just
[02:22:14] flows just like this almost know impact yep kettlebells are good yeah so do that anyway
[02:22:21] where would you get your kettlebells from I get my kettlebells from on it I only get the
[02:22:27] coins actually afterwards and I had a picture I was gonna post it online too but I was like
[02:22:32] you were feeling it was less about that at that point you know but one I again the where
[02:22:39] will forms so and Joe Rogan's on one of the videos on there he kind of mentions is he's like I
[02:22:45] like this one because it's like I think it's like the gorilla or something like that he's like
[02:22:49] it looks at you and it's like it wants to he says you know he says that the gorilla looks like he
[02:22:55] wants to bite your dick off that's what he says something along this line but he has a good point like
[02:23:01] those kettlebells when you're like man I really don't want to do this and then they're just looking at
[02:23:05] you you know and you're like tank you walk away you come back and you look at it and it's still
[02:23:09] looking at you with the same expression because it's you know kettlebells because it's an
[02:23:12] ain't even an object you know because you get into the workout you know you know especially like
[02:23:22] how you you like it's a challenge every time you do that all right on it support right I guess

[02:26:26] subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already iTunes Stitcher Google Play which everyone you
[02:26:31] prefer I think iTunes is a most popular but I see significant references to Google Play
[02:26:39] in general society you know also a lot of them it's a Stitcher yeah you know how like a lot of
[02:26:46] them people they don't want to go mainstream you know it's like like they like keep it old school
[02:26:52] yeah you're around yeah you know it makes sense you know what's the old saying don't go with
[02:26:59] their herd or back less traveled you know one of the same same deal same deal same deal so I get it
[02:27:05] Google Play up but good news is we're on all of them and I just want to choose your avenue also
[02:27:12] YouTube subscribe to our YouTube channel so we do have YouTube channel talk about every week but
[02:27:20] not only does it have the video version of this podcast has excerpts and deluxe excerpts
[02:27:27] what are those excerpts that you have enhanced we'll just say enhanced steps excerpts also you know what
[02:27:33] man I have this other idea you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make little we'll just say other
[02:27:40] little videos too that's what I'm gonna do step-ad value so to speak I like that well the video is a
[02:27:48] very compelling form of interaction with people yeah that's why that's why YouTube I think YouTube
[02:27:55] is like the most searched website bigger than it's more searched than Google maybe I'm wrong but
[02:28:02] it's up there it's if it's not number one it's number two so if you want to learn something people
[02:28:06] immediately yes search YouTube yeah that's what and guess what remember the other day we talked about
[02:28:10] YouTube red yeah I got YouTube red oh like the ads the ads is one thing but also
[02:28:18] because you can listen to music without it being on the screen it plays in the background like
[02:28:24] iTunes that the main reason yeah it's now I can get any album that of there's a lot of music
[02:28:29] a lot of music that I listen to isn't on iTunes because it's old school it's hardcore it's
[02:28:35] underground like literally not on there yeah but the YouTube videos are crazy how it's
[02:28:39] YouTube video beyond there from some random hardcore band from New York upstate New York
[02:28:49] and they're there there they're one album that they made they're one EP five songs long
[02:28:56] that came out in 1987 it'll be on YouTube it's not anywhere near iTunes it's on it and you can play it
[02:29:04] which is awesome yeah make sense I guess they YouTube read sometimes they'll put or not
[02:29:10] sometimes all of times you have YouTube read now no because the main selling point from is that the
[02:29:15] albums without tracks just that you like albums with tracks is your outs without tracks well
[02:29:23] typically I don't listen to YouTube for the music situation not where I go to yeah if you have
[02:29:28] read you'll change that yeah maybe I mean read they push it with hey no ads and then I'm like cool
[02:29:33] no ads but man I'm not that quick to jump on the no ads thing I there have been plenty of times
[02:29:39] right a lot of times with movies but the ads that play I like it'll be for me directed for me like
[02:29:46] dang this ad is helping me yeah yeah yeah the ultimate YouTube person not only click the next video
[02:29:53] I'm gonna enjoy the advertisement yeah I get the title as ads a lot you know that is right
[02:29:57] title it's he's a super smart guy he's actually one of the reasons why like I started reading a lot
[02:30:05] like one of the reasons and so his smart guy but his ads are all over YouTube but I know it's my fault
[02:30:10] because it's relevant to what I watch apparently oh they do that so it's my fault but those
[02:30:17] ads I get title this should you go to college yeah you know I'm talking about anyway yeah so yeah

[02:36:56] purchase review again this means that the person these verified yeah is a hundred percent so here's
[02:37:02] the review as a tea guy I am somewhat picky so I ordered some chocolate tea I'm pretty sure the box
[02:37:08] was growling when I opened it that's a verified review I brewed up some tea and poured it over ice
[02:37:17] after which I went on my bike for training ride I was pulled over twice I explained that I had
[02:37:21] consumed some chocolate tea before I left in the officer just nodded and said get after it
[02:37:27] the next officer was not so forgiving and gave me a ticket for speed limit so in summary this
[02:37:34] team can get pretty pricey if you don't mind speeding tickets while you're writing a bike so as just
[02:37:39] another thing to be careful of if drink joccal weight tea and then you get on a bike you got to watch
